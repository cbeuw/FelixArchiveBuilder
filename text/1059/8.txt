interview/gig: stabbing

I thought rock stars were supposed to have an atti-
tude. You know, leave journalists waiting lor hours
while they go and trash a hotel o r something. N o t
Christopher H a l l , the larynx and creative spark
behind C h i c a g o teclino-metallcrs, Stabbing
Westward. N o , he's practising his roller-blading
inside the C a m d e n I Jnderworld and is more titan
willing, even yearning, to d o an interview with the
humble scribes of Felix.

Pantera or somebody. W e were playingour hard-
est, fastest songs but that's not us; o u r best
moments are when w e switch f r o m being really
quiet to really loud in a single heartbeat."
Thankfully there was plenty o f opportunity
lor Stabbing Westward to produce their best
moments in front of their own, adoring c r o w d
that owning. Aggressive tunes like 'Control',
'Lies', and the masterly A - C . E ' , sat comfortably
alongside more trancey, yet equally angry sound-
bites like W h a t D o I 1 Live '[u Do?', and proved
(as if it needed t o be) that this band has almost
more classic, songs tl in it k n o w s w h a t ' clo with.
