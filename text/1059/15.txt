machinations
To paraphrase a great office-wall
slogan of our times, to exhibit a
spot of bad customer care is
human, but it takes a machine to
thoroughly ruin your day.
Felix is, as far as I know, the
only student newspaper in the
country that publishes weekly.
It's also the only one that prints
in house, which means that my
week doesn't finish when I have
written a rather hurried editorial,
but only when I have taken tens
of thousands of bits of paper and
fed them through a collating, sta-
pling and folding machine.
At some point last Thursday
evening the motor of said
machine developed an electrical
fault and ground to a halt. Had it
not been for the Islamic Society,
we would have had no Felix. I
reckon that it took approaching
45 man hours to put 4200 copies
together by hand (that's 21,000
bits of paper...] So seeing as we
didn't really get underway until
lam, I think it was rather an
achievement. Thank you to all
who helped.
Which is all a long way of
explaining why last week's
Felixes had no staples in them.
In the meantime, various mem-
bers of college maintenance have
spent sizeable amounts of time in
here. Remarkably, it appears to
be fixed... but quite frankly I
don't trust it. So apologies that
Felix is a little thin this week: I
figured 16,800 sheets was a little
more manageable.
all IC students
end up at Kings
Whilst off at the King's Student
Union on Tuesday for an end-of-
the-year London Sabbatical do, it
was a bit of a shock to see so
many attractive females, and
rather alarming to discover quite
so many Imperial students.
Could they be connected?
It was particularly discon-
certing to bump into my colum-
nist, and a bit of a revelation as
well. Simon Baker may be witty,
pithy and erudite, with a well-
honed line of right wing rhetoric,
but he can't dance for toffee.
