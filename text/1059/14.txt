no context
Dear Felix,
Ah, the joys oi out-of-context
quotes! In Rachel's editorial last
week, I am quoted as saying that
it would take major civil unrest
for college to listen to student
opinion. This is not true. I
intended to say that student rep-
resentation on the college exam-
ining committees is unlikely.
Student opinion is considered,
no, requested by all hoard of
studies committees. These com-
mittees concern themselves with
the quality of all academic cours-
es at Imperial. The students who
are asked about student opinion
are the ICU president, CCU aca-
demic affairs officers and the
fCU graduate affairs officer.
Often these people are unable to
consult a wider range of opinions
before representing the student
populace, but they try. Basically,
student opinion is consulted on
most academic matters.
I am sure that student opin-
ion is also requested in many
other areas. The only glaring
omissions as far as I can see is the
lack of student presence on the
examining committees and the
college management planning
group. It is not unreasonable that
students are not on examining
committees, as these committees
often discuss individual students,
f felt that the calculator issue
should have been discussed on
the undergraduate studies com-
mittee which has five student
members. Perhaps a student
presence on the management
planning group would reduce stu-
dent concerns that the college's
need to raise revenue may detract
from the needs of the students.
But I fear that students are
unlikely to be invited to join this
group.
Yours,
Matt Szyndel

postered
Dear Felix,
Obviously, IQ posters are in high
demand with the trend conscious
IC students. Eager students have
snapped up copies around col-
lege. I must stess this is not nec-
essary as personal copies can be
easily obtained by contacting
gaysoc@ic.ac.uk
Yours sincerely,
!Q President

Dear Rachel,
I have always found Simon
Baker's column an enjoyable read
but like "Private Eye" he's not
going to let facts get in the way of
a good story!
If I were to play Simon at his
own game, I'd say that he can't
count and he can't read: there
aren't as many as 12 people
accommodated in the Admissions
Office which he likened to the
Wembley Arena and the admis-
sions form he was asked to com-
plete makes it clear right at the
top that the application is being
made to Imperial College.
Simon is, of course, correct
about some things. Yes, the
Registry did ask for references.
Departments usually require
these because individual students
applying from inside the College
may not be known to selectors
for a particular course.
Furthermore all applicants are in
competition for places and need
to be considered equally by selec-
tors. Yes, I agree it does seem
daft that internal applicants are
asked to provide details of 'A'
level results we already know.
The problem is a practical one of
capturing the information on the
form without having to have even
more people in the Admissions
Office inserting it so that we'd
need a room the size of Wembley
Stadium instead of the Wembley
Arena1
. We are, however,
redesigning the form at the
moment so we will see what can
be achieved.
Yours sincerely,
F V McClure
Academic Registrar
PS Nigel Wheatley is not yet the
Registrar but, on the strength of
Simon's article, he's put in for a
pay rise!
beads ringing
Dear Felix,
Simon Baker writes: "Cambridge
do have the upper hand in one
respect. They've just banned
mobile phones from all their
libraries. Please take note."
I am sure Mr Baker and
other sufferers would like to
know that, after discussion at the
College Libraries Committee, it
is now Library Policy that mobile
phones should not be used in the
College Libraries. This follows
complaints from students and
staff about noisy conversations
and ringing phones left unattend-
ed on desks. Notices will be post-
ed in libraries this week.
Yours sincerely,
Richard Halls
Sub-Librarian,
