film: up close and
personalsfxxiky
Bearing a passing resemblance to Gus Van Sant's
To Die For, Up Close and Personal follows the
meteoric rise of a small-town nobody to big-time
T V personality, but whilst the former was a
wickedly satirical black comedy, this is little
more than a standard rags-to-riches story.
Michelle Pfeiffer plays Tally Atwater, who
gets a job at a Florida local news station run by
former big-shot Warren Justice (Robert
Redford). He takes it upon himself to groom
Atwater into network material and predictably
they fall in love. Then she moves to Philadelphia
to become an anchorwoman and begins to floun-
der, until Justice quits his job to join her.
This is hardly the most original of plots and
the only redeeming aspects of the film are the
performances from Pfeiffer and Redford.
Somehow, despite the script, they manage to
maintain their dignity and there is even some
chemistry between them. The supporting cast
aren't given enough screen time to be more than
instantiy forgettable and it is only Stockard
Channing's super-bitch anchor who leaves any
lasting impression.
Up Close... is a typical Hollywood studio
movie, which relies on the pulling power of its
stars rather than the quality of the script. This is
a nice, safe, feel-good movie; the person upon
whom the Atwater character was based actually
lost her network spot due to a cocaine overdose
and died at 35. Such socially unacceptable char-
acter development would appear to be unsuit-
able, even if it would have made a better film.
film: secrets and lies.idals
I am unwilling to give away too much of the plot:
suffice to say that this film centres around two
siblings; Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a dowdy sin-
gle mother with a grown-up daughter and a fac-
tory job, and Maurice (Timothy Spall), a suc-
cessful portrait photographer with a wife and a
big house, but no children. The film spans the a
month or so before a barbecue held to celebrate
Cynthia's daughter Roxanne's twenty-first birth-
day, and the rising tensions are triggered by
Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a young
woman who becomes friendly with Cynthia.
The acting in this film is excellent, and
Brenda Blethyn is especially good, but to single
her out would be unfair. This film really works
because you do not see any actors at all, only
people you walk past on the street every day.
The main difference between this film and
Naked, Mike Leigh's last film, is that Secrets and
Lies is not as down-beat. The characters are not
so tired of the world, and although their lives are
often painful, they remain optimistic. like
Naked, there is also plenty of humour to lighten
the load, and the background musical ditty is
upbeat, saying "there is something about to hap-
pen, life isn't dull!"
My only warning about this film is its length;
at 140 minutes long, be prepared for it to eat up
your evening. Otherwise I could not recom-
mend it more.
