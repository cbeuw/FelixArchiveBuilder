Silence in the library?
BY RACHEL WALTERS
As substantial excavation work
continues outside the Lyon
Playfair Library, IC's Sub-
Librarian Richard Halls has said
he is 'monitoring the situation
closely'. H e insisted that the
contractors Schal International
were doing everything possible to
minimise disturbance to students
during their exams, and that
there had been no official
complaints. The 'noise is quite
localised', he said. The workmen
have been doing all the 'heavy
noise work' between 8 and
9.30am, before the library opens.
Mr Hall said that the noise
was largely unavoidable if the
plans, which will include a
concert hall, a humanities centre
and a new bookstore in a building
with two new floors are to go
ahead. "We haven't hit any
snags," he said, explaining that
the 'really noisy part' won't begin
until July I st, when a crane will
be installed on the roof. He said
that library staff are 'planning
like mad' to arrange for parts of

while building gets underway.
He admitted that there
would be some disruption to
library services over the summer,
but said that staff were planning
to increase students' book loan

allowances so they could take
their books to study elsewhere if
the noise disturbance became to
great. A new temporary entrance
will be located in the Sherfield
building by the Great Hall while
work on the new lobby proceeds.
News in brief
continued from page one
positions available would be
unsuitable lor casual student
staff because of the skills and
hours required, the College have
a continuing need for part-time
cleaning and waitering staff.
Matt insisted that the plans
would have provided an "excel-
lent service for students who
need money, giving them reli-
able places to work and good
employers." He said that setting
up a specifically student-orien-
tated ageney would help to
relieve the problem of hard-up
students being abused by
unscrupulous employers.
Insisting that College
authorities "are trying to be
sympathetic and constructive,"
Mike Hansen said "we're not
going to say you can't and we're
not going to say you mustn't".
He said the idea was 'intuitively
attractive' and said the College
would be willing to pay a fee for
the service of a system which
could help provide casual staff
once it was set up.
He suggested that I C U
might use some of their profits
from their trading outlets,
including the college bookshop,
to finance the venture. But
Union staff say they no longer
feel confident of the bookstore
revenue. Rental of the new
enlarged shop is expected to go
out to tender this summer, and
it is possible that I C U will lose
the outlet to a large chain, such
as Dillons or Blackwells. "The
job shop is exactly the sort of
initiative that will suffer if we
don't have the bookstore," Matt
Crompton insisted.
Revenue from the book-
store accumulated over recent
years will be spent this summer
on refurbishments to ICU's Beit
Quad premises. A £100,000
refit of the Entertainments
Lounge, as well as a possible new
clubs and societies room has
been planned. Matt defended
the spending: "When a student
goes round on open days, they
look at the university's social
facilities, and we need to
improve them... If we lose some
of our trading we will lose some
of our ability to upgrade the
facilities."
no jobs for the boys
A poll of over 10,000 of the UK's
best finalists showed that only
27% expected to start work on
completing their course. Nearly a
quarter planned to continue
studying, although approximately
one in ten had no fixed plans at
all.
Information from Britain's
top 24 universities cites the BBC
and British Airways as being grad-
uates' most favoured employers.
But there are indications that
today's students are more entre-
preneurial then ever before, as
the category of 'self-employed'
ranked third in the ratings. Other
choices named when students
were asked, "If you could work
for any organisation of your
choice, what would it be?"
included Baywatch, The Mafia,
The Sultan of Brunei, Playboy,
Ann Summers and World of
Leather.
LSE uneconomical
The London School of
Economics is set to have a budget
deficit of £2.5 million this year.
Governors are said to be 'very
worried,' fearing that the disas-
trous showing will have serious
implications for the institutions
long-term competitiveness and
standing.
Kate Hampton, L S E
Students' Union President, has
said that she is concerned that
the deficit will lend weight to the
argument that students should be
charged top-up fees.
AUT doesn't want
grants either
A week after the Labour Party
announced its plans to replace
student grants with a long-term
loans system, the Association of
University Teachers has also
abandoned its long-standing
support for a return to state-
funded grants for all students.
Delegates at last week's annual
conference voted to press all
political parties to address under-
funding, insisting that the current
Dearing inquiry should not use
present funding levels as a start-
ing point for its review.
UK research last
The U K has shown the lowest
growth in expenditure on
research of all the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations
over the past ten years.
The U K ' s gross domestic
expenditure on science, technol-
ogy and engineering was £14.6
billion, giving it an 'average'
rating in comparison to its
competitors. But the funding
levels have not been increasing as
much as other countries.
Expenditure here increased by
18%, compared with 45% in
Germany, and 93% in Japan.
