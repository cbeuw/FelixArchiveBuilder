Summer
Carnival
Can it really be that time
already? Yes, it's only four weeks
until the biggest end of term
Carnival of the year. This year's
Summer Carnival is on June 28th
and promises to be 6 hours of
total fun in the sun. For your
pleasure there's going to be (take
a deep breath...) four different
rooms, with live music from
Succulent who do a garagey vocal
sort of thing, hard house from
James Hockley, plus top Pulpy-
/Sleepery pop from the glam-
orous Showgirls. There's full-on
Reggae in the gym, Chilling-out
and cocktails courtesy of Malibu
in the U D H , and the Poodle-
Chaos crew in the concert hall.
They'll be bringing guest DJs,
backdrops, a tarot reader, and
the magnificent 7-colour laser is
back as well. If you just fancy a
cheesy boogie, the Pop Tarts will
be taking over the Ents Lounge.
Prop Art will be supplying us
with the best club decor
throughout the building, so keep
your eyes open for the three foot
high bumble bees! There's going
to be live music in the Quad, jug-
glers, a barbecue and a glass of
Archers and lemonade to every-
one who gets in!
All that fun is yours for just
£5 (or £4 with an entscard.)
Tickets are on sale in the union:
if there are any left (there were-
n't last year!) they'll be £6 on the
door. Don't miss out on what
promises to be a huge event.
