Sleep to clear toxins
Sleep to perform: data.
Furthermore, a study
published in January 2018
reported that people who
prefer to sleep and wake
up late are at increased
risk of a range of disor-
ders, ranging from psy-
chological, neurological
and respiratory disorders
to diabetes and even pre-
mature morbidity. With
the 9-to-5 schedule being
so ingrained in the society,
how can one improve their
overall sleep?
Sleep better!
One major change
everyone can make is to
their lifestyle, which can
include weight manage-
ment, quitting cigarette
smoking, avoiding late
night food binges and
reducing alcohol and
caffeine intake. Notably,
the circadian rhythm, an
internal clock that de-
termines our sleep-wake
patterns, is hereditary (so
if you’re having trouble
catching those worms,
your parents may be
to blame!). Blue light
emitted by our phones and
laptops may also alter the
circadian clock and affect
our ability to go to sleep.
Therefore, it is advised to
avoid the use of technolo-
gy in the evenings, and if
you really have to watch
that next episode, consider
installing a blue light
filter on your laptop. For
those who have trouble
waking up early, exposing
yourself to sunlight the
moment the alarm goes
off (yes, we’re looking at
you chronic snoozers) can
help you feel more alert
during those 9am lectures.
Finally, finding a com-
fortable sleep position is
important for musculo-
skeletal pain, breathing
and gastro-oesophageal
reflux.
All in all, the path to
maintaining healthy sleep
patterns will include a
lot of trial-and-error.
Listening to your body
is key. There is no exact,
‘one size fits all’ way to
sleep – you have to be
mindful of what works
and doesn’t work for you.
In fact, our ability to sleep
differs from one another,
and it is sometimes hard
to wrap our head around
what is good sleep. The

The glymphatic system clears toxins from the brain. First, cerebrospinal fluid flows into the periarterial space. The water component crosses aqua-
porin channels to reenter the brain, where the solutes can be cleared with astroglial transporters or channels, or can pass through the astrocytic
endfeet clefts. Then, cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid exchange within the brain, which is finally drained into the perivenous space of
deep‑draining veins. // (Jiang, 2019), Stroke and Vascular Neurology

Another important
function of sleep is
thought to be to facilitate
the clearance of a toxin
called amyloid-β which
is an underlying cause of
Alzheimer’s disease.After
induction of sleep through
GABA activity, the extra-
cellular space between the
cells in the brain increas-
es. A clear liquid called
cerebrospinal fluid then
flows from the arteries of
the brain into the space
between the neurons. This
fluid flushes toxins in the
brain into the veins, which
then transport the toxins
into the lymphatic system.
The process which flushes
out toxins from the brain
is called the lymphatic
system of the brain, or the
glymphatic system, as this
process is regulated by
glial cells. When we forgo
sleep, these toxins accu-
mulate in our brain, which
in some cases is believed
to lead to devastating
diseases. So, Imperial,

quality correlated with

the sleep switch
A balance of excitatory
and inhibitory signals
underlies the function
of the central nervous
system. When we are
awake, the neurons in the
brain fire simultaneously
to generate a kaleido-
scope of neural activity.
During sleep, inhibitory
neurotransmitters, such
as γ-aminobutyric acid
(GABA), are released,
allowing us to fall into
a calm, deep slumber.
Specifically, two of these
inhibitory neurotrans-
mitters bind to their re-
ceptors, which facilitates
the inflow of negative
ions upon activation (as
shown in the image to
the right). These negative
ions hyperpolarise the
neuron, which make the
neuron less susceptible to
be activated. In summary,
when falling asleep,
a few neurons release
GABA neurotransmitters
to inhibit the activity of
multiple downstream
neurons, which makes us
lose consciousness. While
scientists have a relatively
good understanding of
how we fall asleep, why
we sleep is currently a
matter of debate.
