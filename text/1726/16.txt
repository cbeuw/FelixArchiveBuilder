Who’s getting down and dirty, and who’s as dry as the
Sahara? Who’s letting their cherries ripen and who’s ‘access
all areas’? Our dedicated team of analysts are pleased
to announce who takes the cake in each of our bespoke
categories.
Topping the leaderboard for most frisky course is Des Eng, with respondents having sex just under 12 times a month. Makes sense; we hear sex is a
good form of inspiration when you can’t decide which crayon to use next. In second place is Medicine, averaging 9.3 times a month. Considering
ICSM is the pit of all debauchery this should come as no surprise. Surprisingly, JMC has redeemed itself to land a spot in 3rd, at around 9 times a
month. Seeing as JMC also takes the cake for most virginated course, the sexually active amongst you lot are working overtime.
At the other end of the spectrum, Chem Eng students sit blue-balled on the top (or at the bottom?), averaging 4.6 lays a month. Following close
behind are Mech Eng (5.1 times) and Chemistry (5.7 times). One could say it is purely coincidental that these are all departments with high
numbers of students who don’t ever leave their buildings, but we think not.

Percentage of virgins by department
Imperial average
Leading the charge of the undefiled,
JMC takes the cake for highest virgin
proportion, with 2 out of 5 students
keeping that cherry on lockdown. Now,
we know what you’re thinking, that’s
probably bullshit. We thought that
too. Then we saw that Computing and
Maths came 2nd and 3rd respectively.
Coincidence? Nah.
Lord of the Virgins
Looks like the RSM is well versed in the Way of the Wanker. Masters in the art of self-pleasure (the ‘solo mambo’, if you will), ESE students are
not afraid to get their rocks off on their own. Materials students are connoisseurs of pornography, clocking in to their favourite sites 3 times a
week (probably escaping having to write those lab reports). Civ Eng students, interestingly enough, don’t really feel themselves (literally and
figuratively). Might be all those splinters from dealing with those beams.
According to our nifty 2D matrix of who finds who attractive,
every department is a little into themselves (which makes
sense - if you don’t back yourself, who will?). Well, everyone
expect Des Eng. Life Sciences and Medicine seem to think
themselves more attractive than everyone else, which is
reinforced by almost everyone else also finding them attractive
too. So they’re excused for the most part. What’s not adding up
is all that self-love going on in Physics. Just how different are
standards over there in Blackett? Hate to burst your bubble,
people, but the rest of the College are seeing are seeing things
through a different pair of lenses. Poor EEE comes in last in
terms of desirability. Which quite frankly is appalling - how
could you not fall for those slender arms toned from hours of
touch-typing?

Cheaters gone wild
Well, at least now we know why Civ Eng aren’t really up for a solo adventure
- ‘why beat your meat when you can just cheat?’, say one in three students in
their department. Earth Science students come in 2nd, which would explain
what they get up to on those unnecessary field trips to Spain (because they
can’t really be looking at rocks, can they?). Life Sciences pull up to the podium
in 3rd, but they’re all sexually liberal anyway so are we surprised?
