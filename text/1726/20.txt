E3 - You’ve heard of the good releases that came from
WithsomeofthegoodreleasesthatarrivedwithE3came
some that didn’t quite meet the mark- featuring mobile
games galore, surprise TV shows, false advertising to
kickstarters, and more! Being the hypefest that E3 is,
not everything lives up to the standard set by fans that
is not being a blatant cash grab!

E
3 has always
been Christmas
for gamers, with
plenty of good
releases that fill you with
surprise and wonder, as
well as a fair handful of
bad releases, the ones that
make you question how
the marketing directors
keep their jobs. Now, I
can imagine most people
have heard about some
of the better releases like
Cyberpunk 2079, Doom
Eternal and Watch Dogs
Legion, and that’s why
I wanted to focus on the
less thrilling events that
transpired during E3, so
let’s get right into it.
Stepping up to the plate
first is the announcement
of more human NPCs
and a battle royale mode
in Fallout 76, which was
somehow met with a great
deal of applause. Let me
elaborate, when your
audience is applauding
you for having more
human NPCs in a game,
it speaks volumes about
the already poor quality
of your game, especially
given the past controversy
that has followed Fallout
76. So, to suddenly hear
the applause for such
a simple addition to an
already very broken
game is saddening to say
the least. What would
have been better is an
announcement that they
were going to actually
make the game playable,
as opposed to adding a
battle royale mode and a
few human NPCs. All-in-
all, it’s a depressing feat
in itself.
Now I like to consider
myself a man of finer
things, those finer things
being binge watching
Always Sunny In Phila-
delphia and learning bird
law. However, I was by
no means anticipating
Rob McElhenney (Mac)
coming onto the stage
in all his muscle-bound
glory and revealing a new
show during the Ubisoft
conference. Despite pos-
sessing the same charm
and charisma as his acting
role, it seems that gaming
fans were not thrilled
by the announcement
due to it being a show as
opposed to a game. The
show itself is focused
around the life of game
developers and features
the likes of Community’s
Danny Pudi and Always
Sunny In Philadelphia’s
David Hornsby. The
response from gaming
fans is expected given
E3’s predominant focus
on gaming as opposed to
any other media, regard-
less of if they relate to a
game. Regrettably, Rob’s
charm couldn’t win the
fans over.
And with that unfor-
tunate tale told, I shift
my cynicism towards the
blatant cash grabs of E3.
Now by cash grabs
I’m not referring to the
classic triple A titles with
horrific micro-transac-
tions - looking at you
EA. Thankfully, this E3
dodged that matter only to
swerve into the oncoming
truck that is mobile game
releases, which are notori-
ous for their micro-trans-
actions and supposedly
‘free’ price tag. Just like
the degradation of the
Command and Conquer
series to a mobile game,
another IP received the
same treatment, Com-
mander Keen, originally
a classic on the MS-DOS
in 1990, the once sacred
childhood memories have
now been desecrated with
its return as a mobile
game. Now I understand
that a mobile game on
its own is perfectly fine,
however, more than likely
micro-transactions will

“When your
audience is
applauding
you for
having more
human NPCs
in a game,
it speaks
volumes about
its already
poor quality”
be applied to this game
in another blatant cash
grab. So for those who
were gaming back when
it was initially released,
get ready to play it again
with none of the original
vintage pleasantries and
all of the cash grabbing
mechanics that come with
the modern age; fingers
crossed that it doesn’t turn
into a raging dumpster
fire.
Speaking of blatant
cash grabs, another mobile
game to unpleasantly
surprise fans is the very
much undesired pop vinyl
mobile game featuring

transactions

oncoming

E3, now get ready to read about the downright awful!
Gears of War. Honestly,
I don’t know what was
going through their minds
when they made this but
it was most likely dollar
signs at this point, but
at least they announced
another Gears game rather
than what they did to Sam
Fisher (from the Splinter
Cell franchise). What
happened to Sam Fisher,
you ask? Well I want you
to imagine this - you’re a
hardcore Splinter Cell fan
and have been waiting for
another addition to the
series since its last release
in 2013, suddenly a news
notification appears on
your phone with the text
“Splinter Cell’s Sam
Fisher returns…” your
eyes lighten up only to
realise that he’s now an
add-on character in a new
Tom Clancy mobile game.
So, long story short,
fans were, as you would
imagine, very disappoint-
ed with the news as their
Wetwork hero returned
only in mobile game
form instead of an actual
triple A title; something
which developers thought
adequate to boast at E3
as opposed to announce
it any other point in the
year where the spotlight
wouldn’t be as near as
bright, nor focused.
Developers of
Shenmue 3 should have
taken that advice when
they abruptly announced
to their Kickstart funders
that they were now
being funded by Sony
and that the game was
also going to be an epic
store exclusive. Refusing
to offer refunds to said
Kickstart funders, they
claimed that their money
was used to show interest
in the game as opposed
to fully fund a new entry
to the series. With blatant
dishonesty also being
shown by the fact that
Shenmue 3 already has
a Steam Store page, yet
the developers have now
gone back on their word
to crowdfunders with its
exclusivity to the Epic
Store. Here’s hoping that
the refunds eventually
come through.
What may not be
received particularly well
are reboots of the Battle-
toads and Contra series
which both look fairly
awful, to say the least.

“Wetwork

the Battletoads reboot
features Rash, Pimple,
and Zits in cartoonish
form, the game looks
like it plays similar to the
originals, but by no means
does it catch its aesthetic.
Contra, on the other hand,
playsverydifferentlyfrom
its predecessors and looks
nothing like it, bearing
the name of Contra in ™
fashion, it appears to be a
blatant cash grab.
All in all, E3 could
have gone a lot worse and,
even then, it was made up
for by some absolutely
brilliant releases, but
what truly won my heart
was the Devolver confer-
ence, which took jabs at
multiple companies and
even going so far as to
release a new game which
is a bootleg collection of
its other games. Present-
ing itself in a cinematic
fashion that continued on
from its previous confer-
ence in 2018, Devolver,
came across as comedic
but not cringey (looking
at you Anthem confer-
ence, dear God that was
painful to watch). With
new horizons being sailed
towards in the gaming
industry, I’m looking
forward to see what comes
of it.
