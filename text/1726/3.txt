Imperial’s refusal to protect workers absolutely from increasing pension contributions risks industrial action later
this year.

mperial College has
rejected a request
from the University
and College Union
(UCU) to commit to
effectively capping
employees’ pension
contributions at 8%,
despite warnings that
the move could trigger
strikes later this year
and in 2020.
Last month, the
College – along with most
other universities – con-
firmed that its preferred
option for the Universities
Superannuation Scheme
(USS) is for pension
contributions to increase

Garden Party
to 21.1% for employers
and 9.6% for employees,
making a total contribu-
tion of 30.7%, in October
2019. Contributions
would further increase to
34.7% in October 2021,
subject to a new valuation
in 2020.
UCU, however, has
raised concerns over the
USS’ “questionable”
position, and accused
employers of betraying
staff by failing to “work
to replace the 2017 [con-
tribution] increases with a
fair outcome”.
In a letter to Imperial
President Alice Gast, the
UCU Head of Higher Ed-
ucation, Paul Bridge, said
universities had allowed
USS to ignore the “most
important recommenda-
tions” of the Joint Expert
Panel (JEP), which pro-
duced its first independent
review last September.
Implementing the JEP’s
recommendations in full
would result in combined
pension contributions of
26%, with 14% paid by
employers and 8% paid
by staff.
Since contributions
under the USS proposals
are higher than could
be achieved under the
JEP’s recommendations,
the plan fails the “no
detriment” test enshrined
in UCU policy. This test
requires no increases in
pension contributions
and no cuts to pension
benefits.
Last week, UCU asked
the College to confirm
that it “will not impose
any benefit cuts and/or
contribution increases,
including contingent
contributions and default
contribution rates for
future valuations, on
members from October
2019 onwards … [includ-
ing] any and all increases
over the rate of 26% (8%
for members) which was
established prior to the
2017 valuation”.
or vote for any proposals
that would involve such
cuts and/or increases for
members”. Alternatively,
the College must “cover
any scheduled increases
in full until USS’s gov-
ernance and valuation
methods and assumptions
have been overhauled”.
The College was given
until last Wednesday to
commit to these demands.
Failure to do so would be
construed as evidence of
a trade dispute between
the College and UCU
members, according
to Bridge, and would
leave the College facing
“a damaging dispute
and strike action”. At a
recent UCU conference,
delegates voted to “com-
mence a dispute with USS
employers and to move
to a statutory ballot for
industrial action in Sep-
tember”. Last year, strikes
disrupted more than 60
universities in the run-up
to exams.
Despite this threat, a
draft response to the letter
circulated to staff earlier
this week rejected the
UCU’s call for the College
to absorb all additional
contributions above 8%.
The College stated it is
willing to take on a greater
share of the combined
contributions but “cannot
agree that members would
not have to take any share
of any increased costs”.
Additionally, the College
said it would continue to
push for affordable con-
tribution rates while ac-
knowledging the decision
would ultimately be taken
by USS and the Pensions
Regulator.
