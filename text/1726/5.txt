Resistance, Resilience and Revolution

or the first time
ever in the lives
of the Sudanese
youth community,
we get to see and expe-
rience a Sudan that isn’t
ruled under Omar-Al-
Bashir’s dictatorship. For
the past 30 years, Sudan
has seen Bashir’s rule take
everything away from
its people – everything
except for the people’s
resilience.
Since the uprisings
began in December
following the rise of fuel
and bread prices, Sudan’s
people have made it clear
that they weren’t going
to settle for anything
less than the complete
removal of the current
regime and the reinstate-
ment of a completely new
government composed
solely of civilians. People
made these demands clear
through peaceful sit-ins,
and were met with the
use of force by Sudan’s
militia. That didn’t stop
Sudan’s people from
continuing to demonstrate
tremendous strength and
courage at the face of
brutality and harsh inhu-
manity, and eventually
led to the toppling and
overthrowing of Omar-
Al-Bashir on 11th
April
– a revolutionary success
deemed legendary by
international spectators,
and deemed tradition
by the locals, who have
peacefully toppled two
previous governments,
once in 1964, and again in
1985.
The Rapid Support
Forces, or the RSF, led
by Mohamed Hamdan
Dagalo – better known
as Hemedti - replaced
Bashir’s rule following
his overthrowing on
11th
April, as well as the
overthrowing of his suc-
cessor less than 48 hours
later. They proposed a
three-year transitional
period in which a military
government was to lead
the country, but were
met with resistance from
the Sudanese public
through peaceful sit-ins.
The public made their
demands very clear
through the Sudanese
Professionals Association
(SPA), as their “official”
voice, and a democrat-
ically elected civilian
government topped the
list of demands.
This time round, the
protestors were met with
a horrific slaughtering
campaign led by the RSF,
aka the rebranded Jan-
jaweed (which translates
to “devils on horseback”).
Systematic rape of men
and women was being
carried out on the roads
of the capital, Khartoum,
with endless accounts of
children having had to
watch their parents being
raped in front of their own
eyes. Accounts of bodies
washing up on the banks
of the Nile river were
flooding social media,
with graphic photos
and videos reaching
everyone’s timelines.
Stabbings, muggings and
lootings became the norm
as the militia lurked the
streets.
Internet access was
also shut down in an
attempt to silence the
protestors and prevent
news of the barbaric acts
from reaching the outside
world. However, the
militia underestimated the
power of the Sudanese
youth, who broke the
internet without any
internet.
Following the past few
weeks, we’ve watched
social media turn various
shades of blue in a show
of solidarity with protes-
tors in Sudan, as well as
a tribute to the martyrs
of the revolution, often
accompanied with the
hashtag #BlueForSudan.
The colour was chosen
following the martyring
of Mohammed Hashim
Mattar, who had just
arrived in Khartoum from
London, and was only 26

the 100s of people gunned
down by the RSF on 3rd
June.
As a member of
the Sudanese diaspora
watching this violence
unfold back home, my
only solace came from
talking to friends and
family also watching
this from afar, filled with
dread and panic as to what
was going to happen next.
With internet being shut
down and access to my
friends being impossible,
it was time to find out
what I, as an individual,

country, and these things
are little steps we can all
take to give Sudan the
justice it deserves.
1. Educate your-
getting any form of
Western media coverage.
Use the hashtags
# B l u e F o r S u d a n ,
#IAmTheSudanRevo-
lution, #SudanUprising,
#SudanCivilDisobedience
and #SudanRevolts in
your posts to raise aware-
ness. It was also due to
the use of these hashtags
on Twitter that the world
finally learnt of the
ongoing crisis in Sudan.
Share information
about Sudan on all your
social media platforms.
There’s an abundance
of information available
online to help you fact-
check, and most Sudanese
people you contact would
be more than happy to
share their stories and
verify reports.
Finally,asimpleretweet
or repost can go a long
way. Look for verified
accounts on social media
and amplify the voices
of Sudanese activists
and organizations on the
ground. @BSOnBlast, @
aElgady, @YousraElbagir
and @Qutoufy are just a
few of the activists who
have been doing a great
job at keeping the world
updated on the Sudanese
revolution.
3. Donate what you
popular of which was
@SudanMealProject,
claiming they would
donate meals and aid to
Sudan in exchange for
follows, likes or story
shares. Following basic
investigations, it was
revealed that these click-
bait accounts were created
for attention and were not
actually working with any
aid organisations, and this
was later confirmed by
UNICEF communications
specialist Joe English,
who says, “it’s incredibly
difficult to send meals to
Sudan”. This further high-
lights the significance of
ensuring you are donating
to verified sources.

around the situation
in Sudan
The ‘Sudan Uprising
Master Document’ is
currently one of the
biggest databases with
information on the Sudan
uprisings, and has an ex-
tensive list of articles and
resources accessible.
‘Tasgot Bas Archives’
was also set up as an
easy medium to help you
navigate the Sudanese
Revolution, with informa-
tion on all the aspects of
the revolution available at
a click.
There’s also an abun-
dance of videos released
on social media platforms
that explain the revolution
in detail, with one of the
most popular being Hasan
Minhaj’s Patriot Act
episode on Netflix.
2. Spread the word

5. Put pressure on
can to registered
non-profit organisa-
tions helping Sudan
Look for legitimate
aid organisations you
can donate to. Save the
Childrenhasbeenworking
in Sudan since 1984 to
help children displaced
by conflict and poverty.
The International Rescue
Committee started work
shortly afterwards in 1989
to help displaced families
by providing food and
shelter, as well as vital
resources. UNICEF has
also worked extensively
in Sudan and has verified
means of donating to help
with the crisis.
There have also been
several fundraisers set up
by the Sudanese diaspora
in hopes of making do-
nations from the interna-
tional community easier.
Check their pages before
donating – most of the le-
gitimate ones have photos
up as proof of where
your money is going. The
GoFundMe “Emergency
Medical Aid For Sudan”
has been verified and is
currently where most UK
donations are encouraged.
Amidst all the social
media coverage, there
have been numerous
Instagram accounts which

4. Attend protests
and vigils being held
near you
In London, Manchester,
and Nottingham, as well
as other major UK cities,
protests are being held
weekly, if not more often.
The saying “strength in
numbers”ismoretruenow
than ever. It is vital that
we all show up whenever
we can to support the
movement and do our
bit for everyone standing
up for democracy on the
ground in Sudan.
Recently, there have
also been vigils held to
commemorate the fallen
martyrs of the Sudan
Revolution – peaceful
protestors who have been
brutally killed under the
military regime. Whilst
being proactive is essen-
tial to the success of the
revolution, it is also vital
that we take time out to
grieve and heal, and it is
so important that we give
ourselves the platform
“The militia
under-
estimated
the power of
the Sudanese
youth”
your local govern-
ment and lawmakers
With numerous
petitions taking off on
Change.org, there is so
much that can be done
to pressurise the gov-
ernment to acknowledge
and condemn the lethal
use of force on peaceful
protestors by Sudan’s
militia. Condemnation,
which isn’t necessarily the
most effective approach,
is essential in recognising
the situation in Sudan as a
crisis, and paving the way
for international observers
and mediated talks that
could finally give democ-
racy a chance.
