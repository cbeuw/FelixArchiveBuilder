Impromptu Part V - Detailing Impromptu
Founders of Impromptu detail the app Itself

H
ello again,
Felix readers!
Congrats on
finishing your
exams! Our prior instal-
ments have touched on
some of the general do’s
and dont’s of setting up
a tech start up, and also
our personal journey.
In this final issue of the
term, Tom and I detail
Impromptu.
The inspiration for the
app stems from our time
as students at Imperial
where we found that
our social life revolved
around our department.
Unfortunately we did not
feel integrated to the rest
of the college, let alone
our surrounding neigh-
bourhood, and we would
have welcomed the means
to do things with people
nearby (to both make
friends and explore the
capital). Having surveyed,
we found this to be a
common theme amongst
students, academics and,
also, young professionals
who struggle to develop
a social life outside of
their work place. The
overriding criticism in
this regard was that there
is no efficient means of
interacting with fellow
citizens and that prevalent
events apps simply regur-
gitate “TimeOut” listings, “The
inspiration for
the app stems
from our time
as students at
Imperial”
or solely cater to dating/
corporate events.
Our solution to this
problem was the devel-
opment of a peer-to-peer
(p2p) events platform
which tempts users with
random events involving
people nearby. When
thinking about potential
USPs, several points were
crucial to us. Variety was
the first; our own expe-
rience had shown that
Google was a powerful
tool to do specific things
but broadening horizons
by doing new things was
not as easy. Spontaneity
was the second; despite
the wealth of opportunity
London offers, finding
friends happy for others
to join them watching the
football. Furthermore,
the nature of Impromptu
will benefit amateur
graphic. Social media
will play a major role in
our marketing campaigns
but we really hope that
Impromptu will grow or-
ganically and build a loyal
userbase. We have plans
that will enable the app
to evolve with reference
to content and to different
demographics. We look
forward to sharing this in-
formation in the new term
along with updates of our
progress over the summer.
We are on target to
launch during Freshers’
week. Prior to this we
will be group testing for
6 weeks. If you would
like to be a part of this
process and have your
feedback contribute
towards the final
product, please forward

Have a great summer
break and join us in Sep-
tember.....

Spontataneity is at the core of the app // Impromptu
things to do at short notice
is famously problematic.
The third was cost; we
are both passionate about
ensuring students and
charities have free access.
As cheesy as it may
sound, our motivations are
centred on enhancing the
student experience. These
USPs were bolstered by
the creation of a unique
x/y browsing interface,
and some unique code
which we are not at liberty
to discuss at this moment.
Practical examples of
Impromptu’s use might
entail coming out of work
with the evening free
and no plans in place. A
simple browse of the user
interface will provide a
host of interesting options.
One might find someone
keen on playing tennis
and needing a partner,
a group of girls looking
for another to join them
for a movie, a tourist in
town looking for a local
to share a drink with, or
perhaps, even a group of
promoters, university so-
cieties and charities (think
recruiting people to food
drives etc.).
The concept lends itself
to any city or town with
a university. Our pre-
dominant user base will
comprise students and
young professionals aged
18-30. We also endeavour
to engage local businesses
that cater to this demo-
