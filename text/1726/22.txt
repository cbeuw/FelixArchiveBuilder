Whisk Desserts: A delightfully decadent all-dessert
pop-up in Angel
We all know that no matter how much you’ve eaten, there’s always room for dessert… but what if your entire
3-course meal was just that - dessert? Arts Editor, Claire, reviews this sweet pop-up just in time for summer!

A
s term ends
(at last!) and
summer makes
its approach,
we can all take a well-de-
served break from the
daily grind of revision and
exams. Holidays abroad,
lazing around in the sun,
icecreaminthepark-what
could be better? On your
list of indolent summer
indulgence should defi-
nitely be Whisk Dessert
Bar, a pop-up restaurant
in Angel which serves
up a three-course meal
consisting only of des-
serts. That’s right, dessert
for the appetiser, dessert
for the main course, and
dessert for… dessert. It’s
the dream for anyone with
a sweet tooth!
The brainchild of en-
trepreneur Randon Burns
and top patisserie chef
Simon Jenkins, this is
actually Whisk’s second
summer running – their
pop-up in Bethnal Green
last year was so suc-
cessful they just had to
make a comeback. Their
new location in Angel is
spacious and very chic –
dark wood and mirrors,
black-and-white tiles and
leather seats. It gives off
the air of an elegant diner.
With Nat King Cole and
sensual jazz playing while
you eat, it’s an excellent
place for a date. We had
what, in my opinion, was
“Little taste
explosions on
your tongue”
the best seat in the house
- right next to the full-
length window on one end
of the room, where we
could watch the evening
melt into dusk over Isling-
ton High Street.
The food itself is fan-
tastic. Simon Jenkins, the
main man in the kitchen, is
an award-winning pastry
chef most recently named
the Craft Guild of Chefs’
Pastry Chef of the Year
in 2018. The three-course
menu he has created is
full of innovative flavour
pairings and intriguing
twists on old classics.
You get a fixed starter and
dessert, but get to pick
from one of six desserts
for your main course.
For a little extra, you can
sample one of the teas or
dessert wines specially
picked to complement
each main course.
Things got off to an
exciting start with the
amuse-bouche, which was
strawberry jelly, vanilla
yoghurt mousse and lime
foam. The lime foam dis-
solved into nothingness on
the tongue, leaving just a
hint of lime to accompany
the strawberry and vanilla
mousse.
Parsnip ice cream and
horseradish zest? Not
something I’d ever think
of putting in dessert, but
there it is on the menu as
part of an orange-choc-
olate confection. Some-
thing to try the next time
I’m back! I had a beauti-
fully light vanilla parfait
with fresh berries, aged
balsamic vinegar and basil
(though it could have used
a little more basil flavour),
while my dining compan-
ion had a very yummy
deconstructed rhubarb
crumble. The warm
roasted rhubarb, sinfully
rich custard cream, cold
verbena ice-cream and
crunchy deep-fried ginger
topping were a texture
and flavour explosion in a
spoonful!
Two items on the menu
are signature dishes from
last summer – desserts
with a savoury twist.
Avocado-white chocolate
mousse with torched
sweetcorn and a chai chilli
dressing, or the raved-
about celery sorbet with
crumbled blue cheese
and fresh honeycomb. I
very nearly went for the
blue cheese myself, but
was prevented from doing
so by my long-standing
hatred of celery. Fortu-
nately, Randon brought
out one of the new dish-
es-in-testing for us to have
a sneak preview. Whisk’s
menu will change over
the course of the summer
to incorporate seasonal
produce; what we sampled
was a watermelon sorbet
with feta cheese, a remix
of the classic watermel-
on-feta salad. Actually
my favourite item of the
evening. The light and
cold watermelon sorbet
fills your mouth while the
more solid crumbles of
feta cheese do little taste
explosions of saltiness on
your tongue. Throw some
pomegranate seeds into
the mix and you’ve got a
winner for summer.
de fruits.
Plating is very pretty;
each dessert comes on
a different style of plate
designed to fit it. Even the
tea is served in delicate
glass cups and saucers
from JING, with a tiny
hourglass tea timer for
the perfect brewing time.
With the relaxed ambience
and exquisite desserts, it’s
a Michelin star fine-dining
experience without the
exorbitant prices. One for
the summer list!
