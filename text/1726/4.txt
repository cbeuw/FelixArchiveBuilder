u n i v e r s i t y
league tables
for 2020 were
published on 7th
June.
The tables rank UK
universities both overall
and for individual sub-
jects.
Imperial maintained its
overall position from last
year in 7th
, an impressive
feat given that many
London universities have
declined. LSE, King’s
College, City University,
and Royal Holloway all
dropped several places.
UCL saw the worst drop-
off amongst the London
universities, falling eleven
places from 11th
place to
22nd
.
The rankings are
based on several criteria:
satisfaction with course,
with feedback, and with
GuardianUniversityLeagueTables:ImperialMaintains
Position teaching – the scores for
which are taken from the
National Student Survey
responses – as well as
spend per student, grad-
uate employment rates, a
‘value added score’ which
compares students’degree
results with entry quali-
fications as a measure of
teaching effectiveness,
and the ‘continuation rate’
of first year students who
stay on for second year.
As in previous years,
Imperial was rated highly
for most criteria, but was
let down by poor student
satisfaction – in particu-
lar, Imperial rates eighth
worst in the country for
satisfaction with feed-
back. Imperial also has
a relatively low ‘value
added score’. In contrast,
it has the 6th
lowest stu-
dent-to-staff ratio, the 4th
highest spend per student,
the highest employment
rate after six months of
any UK university, and
tied 9th
for continuation
rate.
The subject rankings
are mixed. Engineering
subjects at Imperial con-
tinued to excel, with Civil
and Mechanical/Aeronau-
tical Engineering taking
the top spot in the UK for
another year running, and
Chemical Engineering
climbing from 4th
to 2nd
.
EEE/EIE and Materials
both dropped just one
place, from 4th
to 5th
and
6th
to 7th
, respectively.
Joining the engineers
in their dominance are
the Computing and Earth
Sciences courses, placed
4th
and 1st
, respectively.
Mathematics showed the
greatest improvement,
rising from 21st
to 8th
place. Medicine and Bi-
osciences each also rose
several places, from 11th
to 9th
and 13th
to 8th
.
The Faculty of Natural
Sciences, however, con-
tinues to struggle. Physics
came in at 38th
, falling for
the third year in a row,
while Chemistry placed
in 42nd
. Both have seen
catastrophic declines over
the past several years; just
three years ago, Chemis-
try placed 19th
and Physics
placed 8th
.
St. Andrews students
will be happy, given
that they have finally
overtaken Oxford for 2nd
place. The order of the top
three universities has been
Cambridge, Oxford, then
St.Andrews in 3rd
since the
2015 tables. This sort of
“reordering” is common
outside of the top three
– the top ten universities
from the 2019 rankings
are all in the top eleven
in the 2020 rankings, the
newcomer being Exeter,
who rose four places from
14th
to 10th
.
The falloff of London,
one of the UK’s education
hubs, accompanies an
overall decline in UK
universities as ranked in
international tables. The
QS world rankings for
2020, released earlier this
week, saw two thirds of
the UK’s ranked universi-
ties falling in the wake of
financial constraints due
to the economic uncer-
tainty caused by Brexit.

Union to launch h-bar evening food service
NEWS

Editor-in-Chief
I
mperial students
will soon be able
to enjoy evening
bar food at h-bar
again, following the
Union’s announcement
that it will be launching
a new menu at h-bar on
Wednesday 26th June.
This comes in response
to student discontent at
College’s decision to cut
the evening bar food of-
fering at h-bar in March,
as reported by Felix.
Felix was fortunate
enough to receive an
invitation from the
Imperial College Union
Commercial Services
team to attend an ex-
clusive taster session to
get the inside scoop on
what to expect from next
week’s revamped menu.
Also in attendance were
postgraduate (PG) faculty
reps, h-bar managers and
members of the current
and former GSU commit-
tee.
sharing possibilities are
amazing and we’re going
to do some really great
food and drink deals and
they’ll complement our
new drinks really well in
the bar”.
The menu, which
consists of new ideas
developed from student
feedback, as well as some
trusted favourites, has
been designed with the
idea of sharing in mind,
following feedback from
h-bar users about how
much the tapas style food
was missed. Whether
you’re popping in for a
meal for yourself, have a
few snack plates, or want
to scale up portion sizes
to fit your group size, the
new menu has the flexi-
bility to do just that. The
wings, churros, bao buns
and burgers on offer in
particular were favourites
amongst those in attend-
ance at the food tasting.
As this menu is being

h-bar is Imperial’s post-
graduate pub and bar, and
is run as a joint venture
between Imperial College
and the Union, with the
food offering provided
by College and the drinks
provided by the Union.
The decision to cut the
evening bar food service,
which sparked outrage,
was made due to financial
reasons and meant that
food would no longer be
available in h-bar after
7pm, much to the chagrin
of staff and students alike.
The Union’s decision to
reintroduce the evening
food service at h-bar can
be seen as its refusal to
let the only postgrad spe-
cific bar be discriminated
against, something for
which it should be com-
mended.
The wings were described as "not too spicy but also have a slight kick" // Joseph O'Connell-Danes
“I love the
wings, they’re
not too spicy
but also have a
slight kick, and
the homemade
hummus is a
lovely touch”
“I thought
the buns were
delicious, 10
out of 10, and
the mozzarella
sticks to die
for”

Jason Hosken, one of
the student duty managers
at h-bar said: “I thought
the food was excellent and
I’m really glad that we’re
finally bringing some food
back to h-bar. I think the
introduced on a trial basis,
it is still subject to change
and will adapt depending
on feedback received
from students and to keep
up with seasonal changes.

The new menu came
about through months
of development between
Sam Swiniarski (the
Union’s Chef de Partie)
and Jason Hosken, Mohit
Devgan (the future GSU
President) and Ute Thi-
ermann (the current GSU
President), who were all
instrumental in communi-
cating the thoughts of the
students they represent,
as well as providing
feedback in each tasting
session.
Deputy President
(Finance & Services),
Claudia Caravello, told
Felix: “It was important
to us that we introduce
a menu that postgrads
wanted. It was never going
to work if we just picked
what food we thought
they wanted and forced
it upon the students and
staff. That’s why we have
worked hard with h-bar
manager Jason and future
“My personal
favourite was
the bao buns”
