A Midsummer night’s dream
The Bridge Theatre brings us an ambitious, funny and immersive production of William Shakespeare’s play
T
here is no line be-
tween audience
and stage at The
Bridge. Or rather,
there are multiple lines,
but they are constantly
changing, with raising
platforms, movable stair-
cases and rolling beds;
the actors jumping to the
middle of the crowd or
shouldering an unsus-
pecting audience member.
The action happens all
around and above the
stage, and you have to be
part of it, move with the
sets and make way for the
next scene. Don’t worry,
nice and helpful crew
members will be around
to direct you! However,
sometimes this means you
will miss one or two sen-
tences from the play, and
that you have to choose
smartly where to stand or
else you might find your
“one-meter-sixty” self
behind an annoyingly tall
guy. Theatre meets stra-
tegic planning. Unless, of
course, you opt for one of
the seats in the galleries,
where such problems
don’t exist.
“Of course, it
could all have
just been a
dream”
Hammed Animashaun as
Bottom is purely adorable
at all times and probably
responsible for the louder
laughs of the evening.
Sure his character was
meant to be comical, but
his knowing winks and
expressiveness added a
new layer of amusement.
Some roles in the
original play are swapped:
it is Titania, the Fairy
Queen, who uses the
love-in-idleness flower
to manipulate four young
lovers through a series
of misunderstandings,
and Oberon, the Fairy
King, who is enchanted
into falling in love with a
man turned into an ass. A
cheeky way to re-examine
the power balance in the
relationship between
their mortal counterparts,
Theseus, Duke of Athens,
and Hippolyta, leader of
the subjugated matriar-
chal tribe of the Amazons.
And, of course, an excuse
to have a shirtless dance
from Oliver Chris, and
a lovely mischievous
grin from Gwendoline
Christie.
roles: the relatable “rude
mechanicals”, honest
and well-intentioned,
the only ones unaffected
by the magical events of
the night; and the fairies,
a troupe of glittering,
tight-fitted dancers who
enter and marvel with their
aerial and pole stunts.
The technical aspect of
the performance is as well
polished as the acting.
From act to act, the stage
gradually turns into a wild
forest, with ivy growing
on the props, mysterious
fog, nighttime animals’
sounds, and an expressive
balance of darkness and
light. The costumes are
gorgeous, all timings are
perfect and the music
either builds the required
ambience or is in itself a
comical element.
Overall, this is a
truly amusing produc-
tion. Greatly thanks to
Shakespeare’s genius in
devising such a convolut-
ed plot, with all its witty
remarks, word plays and
unexpected turns, but also
thanks to fun acting gags,
a clever choice of props,
metatheatrical references,
and a turning of the pit
into a party dance floor.
Of course, it could all
have just been a dream.

This means the action
is always performed very
close to the audience. A
daunting task to which the
actors respond beautifully,
giving life to their charac-
ters often just a few centi-
metres away from scruti-
nising eyes. David Moorst
as Puck, the naughty
fairy, is particularly im-
pressive, able to keep his
impish tics and posture
even while boasting
some aerial circus skills.
