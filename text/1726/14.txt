It’s that time of year again - time to compare, contrast and compile your scandalous shenanigans and frisky fetishes in this year’s Sex Survey. We’ve
received alo whopping 1768 responses to our call to arms, from a wide cross-section of the Imperial populus.
Our committed team of Felix reporters turned ‘sexy-time’ investigators (STIs, if you will) have spent the better half of yesterday trawling through
all the data, filtering through all the responses to make sense of all your bedroom shenanigans. To be quite honest, some of the responses to the
survey were, well, unconventional, but we’re not here to judge. However, we might be signing up for Counselling.
This year, we thought we’d switch up our writing style just a smidge (why take things seriously when none of you lot did).
So, without further ado, here’s the 2019 Felix Sex survey.
Who took the survey?
Assuming our very scientific sex survey is
indeed indicative of Imperial as a whole,
Which way do you swing? Well, most Imperial students
(78.6%) identify as straight, with the non-heterosexual
component taking up the remaining 21.2%. These
include people identifying as bisexual (11.6%),
homosexual (5.7%), pansexual (1.1%), queer (0.8%),
asexual (0.7%) and other (1.3%), as unfortunately our
list is not nearly comprehensive enough to include other
possible sexualities (e.g. demisexual, aromantic, etc.)
As with everything
vaguely fun
at Imperial,
undergraduates are
overrepresented in the
Sex Survey this year,
comprising nearly
90% of respondents.

then the skew in the male:female ratio (61:38) should come as no surprise to anyone. Non-
binary (don’t identify fully as male or female) account for 0.9% of respondents, and 0.4% of all
participants identify as a gender different to what was assigned to them at birth.

Shoutout to the 9 people who identified
as other - not sure how you can other
yourself in this category, but thanks for your
input anyway! We’re assuming you’re just
unemployed.
Contrary to popular belief, most Imperial students have indeed had ‘the
sex’! In hindsight, this would actually make sense, given that it’s a good
form of exercise (finding a sexual partner that is, but also the sex part).
The data suggests that the average Imperial student loses their
virginity at 17 years, 7 months and 27 days, at approximately 2:24 in
the afternoon, give or take a few decades. This would indicate that the
average Imperialist pops their cherry just in time to start uni - maybe to
prevent appearing inexperienced following their first conquest at Sports
Night.
