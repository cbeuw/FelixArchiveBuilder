Oxygen: the generator of life
New research indicates that oxygen abundance was strongly correlated to cycles of flourishing and declining
biodiversity during the development of prehistoric multicellular life.

is interrupt-
ed by the constant buzzing
of a fly, do not think of it
as the predetermined be-
haviour of a bothersome
insect, but that of a many-
times-removed cousin.
Most animal phyla (the
major groups under which
the animal kingdom is di-
vided, based originally in
their body plan and then
on genetics) first appeared
on the fossil record 540
million years ago, during
an event known as the
Cambrian Explosion.
Worms, molluscs and even
the very first recognisable
ancestors of vertebrates
started crawling the
seabed during that period,
all in a timespan of around
20 million years, which
is a negligible amount of
time in geological terms.
The causes of such an in-
crease in both the number
and diversity of species
are still heatedly debated
by palaeontologists and
biologists, with theories
ranging from an increase
in calcium concentration
in the oceans to an arms
race between predators
and prey. But recently,
researchers think that they
have found the one major
reason behind the event.
Apparently, it was
oxygen. “More specifi-
cally, what we have found
is that the variations in
oxygen concentrations
during the period can be
correlated with cycles
of ‘boom and bust’ in
the biodiversity of the
Cambrian. Higher con-
centrations of oxygen are
found in periods where
species thrived; lower
ones are related to ex-
tinction events,” says Dr.
Tianchen He, one of the
leading researchers from
the University of Leeds.
The researchers
measured oxygen concen-
trations in the atmosphere
at the time by studying
two isotopes of sulphur
“correlations
between
oxygen
abundance
and the
blooming of
life coud not
be clearer”
“oxygen
variations...
gave way
to other
environmental
and geological
factors”
and carbon that are
present in rocks of the
period excavated in the
banks of the Lena River,
Siberia. In a chemical
process known as reduc-
tion, compounds with
both oxygen and sulphur
or oxygen and carbon
lose their oxygen atoms
(they are “reduced”), and
oxygen in gas form is
released. Thus, when high
concentrations of reduced
carbon and sulphur are
found in rocks from the
time, it can be deduced
that the amount of oxygen
in the atmosphere was
also substantially large.
The variation of
oxygen in the rocks
was compared to past
palaeontological world-
wide records on species
biodiversity throughout
the Cambrian, and the
correlation between
oxygen abundance and
the blooming of life could
not be clearer. “This cycle
continued for 40 million
years, causing micro-ex-
tinction events when
oxygen concentrations de-
creased,” says co-author
Professor Graham Shields
from University College
London. “There is a
singular, final and globally
evidenced episode of oxy-
genation around 500 Ma
at the end of the Cambrian
Period called the SPICE
event. The subsequent
geological period, the
Ordovician, was quiet by
comparison.”
It seems that oxygen
variations were instru-
mental for explaining the
radiation of multicellular
life, but, once this class
of organisms was estab-
lished, it gave way to
other environmental and
geological factors as the
main driving force behind
biodiversity dynamics.
The end of the Ordovician
(440 million years ago)
saw a major extinction
event that drastically
reduced the number of
marine species. This time,
though, it was a global
glaciation that caused the
catastrophe.
The researchers are
to be analysed in order to
confirm that the variations
were, indeed, a global
phenomenon. Provisional
results from rocks found
in China appear to comply
with the hypothesis. “We
have found a similar
pattern at least for one of
the excursions in South
China. However, we are
still working to confirm
our findings in Morocco
and Mongolia,” says Dr.
He.
One of the most
essential elements for
our survival was most
probably instrumental in
triggering the changes
that made us what we are.
Breathing not only keeps
you alive, but may also
have been responsible for
generating multicellular
life in the first place. Every
creature in that group,
from flies to us, should be
thankful for that.
