Israel Trip 2019: What did participants think about
Israel ?
F
or the 3rd
consec-
utive year, the
Israeli Society
organised a seven
day trip to Israel last
March. The trip aimed to
show the growing tech
sector of Israel, as well
as the cultural side of the
country. Want to be a part
of it next year? Why don’t
you take a look at what
two participants this year
remember from their first
time in the Holy Land.
Mohammed Sakir
Mahmood, Medecine:
“Israel is rich with
history and controversy.
Mainstream media today
focuses on the political
conflict within the region.
However, what the Israeli
Society has achieved
is moving the spotlight
away from politics
towards something that
is undeniably Israeli
to its core: the start-up
nation. Many students at
Imperial College have
been involved in the en-
trepreneurial world, or at
the very least, have heard
the term thrown around
in discussion; but experi-
encing a nation which has
built its current standing
on innovation was truly
something else.
Human capital is a key
resource in the country,
and a mindset of chal-
lenging the status quo is
commonplace. The com-
bination of the discipline
instilled by compulsory
military service, and the
country’s focus on STEM
education, has produced
innovations such as
Mobileye and Pillcam.
It was truly a privilege
to visit establishments

Imperial College
such as the Technion,
the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem and the
Weizmann Institute —
the birthplace of many
of these world-changing
technologies.
As well as the
wide-ranging tech visits,
the programme included
many opportunities to
explore the country’s rich
culture and natural beauty.
A highlight of the trip was
climbing Masada to watch
the sunrise amongst the
beautiful vistas surround-
ing the mountain; the
significance of the place
was made apparent by the
history lesson we received
from our tour guide, Ilan
Bloch. The story of King
Herod’s retreat and the
Jewish settlers was simply
fascinating. Israeli food is
also something to behold,
from the deliciously
sweet and creamy Malabi
to the rich and savoury
Shakshuka — needless
to say our appetites were
whetted well.
Last, but not least, the
religious significance of
Israel wasn’t lost to us.
The Bahai gardens in
Haifa was a spectacle to
behold indeed, with lush
trees lining the walkways
adorned with gleaming
white marble, all in the
presence of tomb of the
BahaUllah. Jerusalem,
being a religious epicentre
for Jews, Muslims and
Christians, showed us
how these groups live
together.
The committee of the
Israeli Society should be
lauded for their efforts,
as the trip was a truly
monumental achievement
that they should be proud
of. Their efforts led to
students from all depart-
ments and many different
walks of life coming
together and creating
memories to be cherished
as well as lifelong friend-
ships. It was a privilege
to be part of this trip,
and I recommend anyone
reading this, to apply for
next year’s Israel tech
trip!
Shalom.”

A e r o n a u t i c a l
Engineering:
“As everybody else
went home for Easter, a
diverse group of students
from different walks of life
set out on an eye-opening
trip to the Holy Land.
Our goal was to learn
about the fantastic tech-
nological achievements of
the start-up nation, while
exploring the rich natural
beauty the land had to
offer. Each of us had pre-
conceptions of Israel, and
we set out to see what the
country could offer.
What we got was a
glimpse into an ancient
culture, a story of a
people whose resilience
was embodied, not only
by their famous entre-
preneurial spirit but also
by an unending struggle
to find their place in the
world. This story was told
by the spectacular sights
and sounds we immersed
ourselves in, from the
blood fraught history of
Masada, to the harrowing
narrative of the Holocaust
Museum and the bustling
nightlife of Jerusalem and
Tel-Aviv. Adding to the
narrative was open-ended
and thought-provoking
discussions with the
locals, students from
Israeli universities and our
various guides, foremost
of them Ilan.
We started the trip in
Tel Aviv, riding the local
Lime rented bikes while
savouring the delicacies
of Carmel Market.
Historical heritage and
technological innovation
were intertwined in all
aspects of the city. Being

Israeli Society
Imperial students, we
were able to appreciate the
country’s strong emphasis
on technological advance-
ment, best exemplified
by institutions including
the famed Technion,
Weizmann Institute and
Hebrew University of
Jerusalem. Some of the
astonishing displays
included a world’s first
nano-sized Bible and
models of Nobel Prize
winning quasi-crystals.
Yet with all that moder-
nity, we were also exposed
to another side of Israel
– the more alluring side.
We stayed in a Bedouin
camp in the Negev with
(God forbid!) no cellular
service, enjoying tradi-
tional Arab dinner and
basking in the starry night.
In Jerusalem, we
learned about the rich
religious heritage of
the Muslim, Christian
and Jewish peoples,
distinct yet inseparable
in a modern city with a
historical core. It was the
most enriching experi-
ence of the trip, in terms
of historical context and
cultural understanding.
The nightlife of Jerusalem
brought another dimen-
sion to the city. In contrast
to many European cities,
the Israeli markets were
still well lit and raucous,
even at 10pm.
Spending a week in
Israel felt long. When it
was time to finally say
our goodbyes, we did so
with vows to return. The
enriching experiences
invoked a sense of awe
and perspective that will
remain in our memories
for years to come.
Someday I will reflect on
my life, and I’ll remember
this one week when we
visited breathtaking
places, enjoyed great food
and had unforgettable ex-
periences with absolutely
amazing company.”
