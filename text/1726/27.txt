andy Djibouti,
whose tenure
concludes at
the end of the
academic year, made
the announcement of
his decision at the final
Council session last
week, where only five
people were awake to
hear him.
The decision comes
after a large number of re-
sponses to the Sex survey
calls for the former editor
to bare all, with respond-
ents claiming to make
queries such as “Randy
Djibouti fucks hot bubble
butt” in their latest porn
searches.
Mr Djibouti was in high
spirits as he completed
his final rounds dropping
off the newspaper. “To
be honest, it didn’t actu-
ally cross my mind until
people kept saying it,” he
told NegaFelix, “then I re-
alised I’m in high demand,
you know? Grad schemes
are hard to come by these
days, so I’ll take whatever
I can get. Plus, I get a free
gym membership!”

potential,” wailed Abigail

of the competent ones;
now I’m left to deal with

“Yeah he’d be great at
it, he’s got spunk,” said a
staff member, who shall
remain unnamed, “wish
I’d have been able to help
him practice for the role

Union staff have
turned to an unlikely
source for guidance
after a recent threat
assessment suggested
an unfortunate turn
of events at its annual
gala.
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
T
he Events
team, who are
responsible for
the planning
and execution of the
event, have reportedly
enlisted the services of
a psychic, in the hopes
of foreseeing a fortunate
outcome for this year’s
Summer Ball.
The move was prompt-
ed following an internal
breakdown in communi-
cation, leading to strikes
by performers and bar staff
over freedom of move-
ment around campus.
“Who do they think they
are?,” exclaimed Jon
O’Barnaby-Howell, Farts
& Containment Chair.
“These are our demands;
we will not back down!”
NegaFelix was thank-
fully able to gain an audio
recording of the meeting
with the psychic.
“It’s going to be a shit-
storm, but quite frankly
you don’t need to be
clairvoyant to see that,”
they said grimly. “Wasn’t
there some drama behind
the scenes in the Union?
Stupid question, there’s
always drama in your
damn building. Anyway,
it’s your fault; you
shouldn’t have let any of
those goddamn anti-vaxx-
ers into the Union.”
Daniella Donatella,
Deputy President (White
Lies & Erasures), was
found to be in a frenzy
after the consultation.
“Why can’t anything go
right in this goddamn uni-
versity?!,” she exclaimed,
whilst attempting to tear
her hair out. “Honestly the
only reason I’m still at this
job is because it makes me
feel like I’m still young,
but the novelty is starting
to wear off.”
As if consultants weren’t enough of a waste of money... // Flickr
Union hires psychic to whisper sweet nothings of
Summer Ball success
This week you’re the
poor soul who had to read
through the Sex Survey
responses.
Might need a long soak in
some holy water because
you lot are wild.
This week you found
some free space in the
library!
Finally! A free table to
get laid on.
This week you need some
cash for the summer.
You’re considering this
Seeking Arrangements
thing.
We foresee an STI in
your future.
This week you’re the
Felix Editor. They
doubted your abilities;
said you couldn’t do it.
Were they wrong though?
This week you decide it’s
time to pamper yourself
with a trip to the sauna.
Might as well save money
and head to the Sci-Fi
library.
This week you in need
of a job. You’re worried
about your chances given
your record of workplace
harassment.
Don’t worry, you’ll fit
right in here!
This week none of the
answers in your multiple
choice exam seem to
make sense.
It’s almost a bit like the
Conservative leadership
contest.
This week, pissed with
your useless supervisor
ignoring your goddamn
e-mails, you mail dung to
his office.
It’s worth as much as his
support anyway.
This week your
housemate breaks your
favourite mug and you
finally lose it.
Deposit be damned,
you’re fucking her shit
up.
This week you decide to
spice up your love life
using the Sex Survey

Desperation is taking
sex tips from Imperial
students.
This week you finally
finish fourth year!
You can finally leave
Imperial!
Lol you’re a medic.
Enjoy fifth year on
Monday!
