T
he past nine
months have
seen the birth
of Extinction
Rebellion in the UK, the
global school strike for
climate movement and,
of course, the weekly
Sustainability column in
Felix. Before the news-
paper goes on hiatus until
October, it seems only fit-
ting to report on the events
which, to a large extent,
played out just across
the park from Imperial
College this April.
The afore-mentioned
environmentalmovements
are a counter-culture of
the 21st century, opposing
“Extinction
Rebellion
echoes the
message of
the Campaign
for Nuclear
Disarmament”
“Extinction
Rebellion has
reframed the
debate on
climate change
and added
urgency to
the discourse
on climate
change”
the elements of society
they see as culpable for
environmental damage
and the present climate
crisis, much as the coun-
ter-cultural movement
of the `60s opposed war,
particularly the nuclear
variety. The first environ-
mental movement arose in
response to the over-use
of the insecticide DDT,
whose unintended threat
to human and natural life
was made known by the
biologist Rachel Carson
in her book Silent Spring.
Is the most recent wave of
activism anything new?
Are Extinction Rebellion,
and related movements,
having a meaningful
impact?
As with the movement
against DDT, science has
been the trigger for recent
protests. Extinction Re-
bellion cites the 2018 In-
tergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC)
report, which predicts that
emissions of greenhouse
gases must reach net zero
by 2050 in order to avoid
a heating of more than 1.5
degrees Celsius, as one of
their sources of motiva-
tion. Extinction Rebellion
echoes the message of the
Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament when they
argue “humanity, as well
as life on Earth, is facing a
‘direct existential threat’”.
Extinction Rebellion
has re-framed the debate
on climate change and
added urgency to the dis-
course on climate change
Secondly, it promotes
active participation in
tackling the climate
crisis. The decentralised
networks that it builds up
in the preparation for the
protests give spaces for
communities to meet and
campaign on environmen-
tal issues. This physical
interaction, lacking in
one-way dissemination of
information via traditional
andsocialmedia,mayhelp
to achieve the changes in
lifestyle and culture that
the IPCC argue “have a
considerable influence on
energy use and associated
emissions”, and may
influence new groups of
people such as high street
shoppers. Direct action
forces want to act as a
representative of the envi-
ronmental movement not
just as a citizen, but also
as a friend, child, parent,
employee, or employer.
Of course, activism
alone won’t achieve the
decreases in emissions
necessary to avoid a long-
term warming of 1.5°C,
but equally an economy
geared for exponential
growth and legislation
supporting this will fail.
Unarguably, the Extinc-
tion Rebellion movement
is controversial. Their
policy of advocating
non-violent civil disobe-
dience saw 1130 arrests in
ten days from activists. So
far seventy people have
been charged but police
have admitted that they
have limited sentencing
powers for further arrests.

The actions have included
acts of rebellion ranging
from unfurling a banner
saying “don’t jail the
canaries” from a DLR
train in Canary Wharf in
response to the role of
the financial services in
funding environmental
destruction, to lining
Westminster Bridge with
plants during ten days of
protest in April. Despite
bringing central London
to standstill they received
a significant amount of
support. Just after the
aforementioned protests,
a quarter of 2000 UK
citizens who responded
to a poll by ComRes
agreed with the statement
“I support the aims and
tactics of Extinction Re-
bellion”, the majority (43
%) responded that they
didn’t know, and a third
disagreed.
These mixed responses
suggest that environmen-
tal movements have the
potential to be divisive.
Unlike avoiding nuclear
war, the benefits and
costs of climate change
mitigation, the challenges
in achieving it, are less
obvious. I spoke with a
Green party candidate at
a later protest who argued
that, to achieve a zero-car-
bon economy by the IPCC
deadline of 2050, the UK
needs to invest in wind
and solar generation, but
was unable to give any
figures to support his
argument nor to counter
the challenges of supply
and demand, the greatest
challenge at present.
Giving people facts is key.
Human activities have
caused a rise in global
temperature of one degree
Celsius since pre-indus-
trial times. Students and
academics have the ability
to testify to these facts,
and these facts need to be
heard on the streets.
Furthermore, civil
disobedience can exclude
people who could lose the
right to work, study or the
ability to pursue a certain
profession should they be
charged. When I visited
the protests at Marble
Arch, many protesters
seemed to be in fairly
financially secure situa-
tions and of a left-leaning
persuasion. Though the
movement describes itself
as non-partisan, some of
the messages mixed the
separate issue about Brexit
with the climate debate.
In a country which voted,
rightly or wrongly, for an
exit from the EU, mixing
issues which are not
related is dangerous. If too
much emphasis is placed
on tactics which exclude
participation of certain
members of society, this
could be used to paint
harmful stereotypes of the
environmental movement
such as that of the white
middle-class “hippie” or
the wealthy, tofu-burg-
er-chomping millennial.
Role-models of all creeds,
countries and classes exist
within the environmen-
tal movement and can
support those from other
sections of society to
amplify environmentally
positive culture. From
Wangari Maathai, the
founder of the Green
Belt movement in Kenya,
to Greta Thunberg, the
sixteen-year old standing
for the climate outside
the Swedish parliament,
environmentalists span all
ages and continents.

ronmental protests have a

secure income, and it was
clear that efforts had been
taken to avoid religious
or financial obstacles to
participation. Coaches
provided free low-carbon
travel from all corners of
the country to London and
a self-organized network
of environmentalists
provided accommodation.
Tongue-and-cheek, one
might even say that the
protests provided benefits
to London. They tem-
porarily installed a solar
farm at Marble Arch and
provided a full-scale sim-
ulation of a zero-emission
zone in central London.
They also brought social
co-benefits, protesters
supported the local
homeless community by
providing free food and
taking collections for the
poor.
So, is environmental
activism an effective
strategy to tackling
climate change? I argue
it has a part to play.
Extinction Rebellion has
an enormous potential
to build communities
and place pressure on
politicians. But there is
a risk it could polarize
opinions on the climate
change. Uninformed
activists can project a
damaging image on the
environmental issue, and
its demand to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions
to net zero by 2025 are
pretty radical to say the
least. However, activism
can help to create com-
munities which support
changes in lifestyle which
may encounter resistance
if introduced through
legislation. The climate
emergency requires action
globally, and rapidly. Both
top-down and bottom-up
approaches are necessary
to achieve this.
The public uproar from
Silent Spring resulted in
the US administration
introducing a nationwide
ban on DDT, though it
was only in 1972, a decade
after the publication of
Silent Spring that this
came into law. Extinction
Rebellion achieved some
of its goals more rapidly.
The UK government
announced a climate
emergency on 1st May as
a result of pressure from
the Extinction Rebellion
movement and has com-
mitted to net zero carbon
emissions by 2050. But is
this enough?
No.
Governments alone,
through a top-down
approach, have limited
impetus or ability to
make the necessary
social changes to tackle
the climate emergency.
Before 2050 there will
be at least six general
elections and, as has been
shown in the US with
Trump’s withdrawal from
the Paris Agreement,
future politicians may
not respect words written
on paper by current ones.
What action “the climate
emergency” needs is
not yet well defined, but
surely a cultural shift
means more than banning
plastic straws. Bottom-up
approaches from environ-
mental movements can
help to create communi-
ties to facilitate changes
in lifestyle, and hold
governments accountable
to their commitments.
See you next year!
