Psychedelics research at Imperial College enters a new
phase

T
he second phase
to be exact. This
year the newly
minted Centre
for Psychedelic Research
at Imperial College
London began conducting
a first-of-its-kind phase
II clinical trial designed
to test how effective the
hallucinogenic compound
psilocybin is at treating
patients with major de-
pressive disorder versus a
current prescription anti-
depressant, escitalopram.
While several clinical
trials using psilocybin
have been catching head-
lines recently, the research
at Imperial College is
taking the next step by
comparing psilocybin, the
active ingredient in magic
mushrooms, with the cur-
rent standard of care, to
see just how much better,
if at all, psychedelics can
make the lives of patients.
Why the sudden in-
in many clinical studies
throughout the 50s, the
spread of psilocybin and
LSD out of the clinic and
into the general public
worried the American
government. Afraid that
the values of middle-class
Americans were being
eroded, the government
banned psychedelics,
labelling them as being
“without any currently
accepted medical use in
treatment.” Research into
the medicinal benefit of
psychedelic compounds
was almost completely
abandoned by the end of
the 1970s and yet the idea
that the intense experienc-
es induced through the
psychedelic state might
help patients reconcile
grief or engrained addic-
tive behaviour persisted
in the minds of a few
pioneers.
Interest was reignited
in 2001 following FDA
approval for a clinical trial
showing that psilocybin
could reduce obsessive
behaviour in patients with
OCD, and again in 2006
with a study showing
that psilocybin-induced
spiritual experiences
could have long-lasting
positive effects on well-
being and behaviour, even
in healthy patients. In
effect, these two studies
opened the floodgates on
FDA approval for clinical
trials using psychedelics
and granted long sought
after credibility to the
emotional significance of
“the trip” and what is now
called the psychedelic
therapy model, in which
patients without a history
of schizophrenia are given
high-dose psychedelics
and are guided through
the trip by trained ther-
apists under controlled
conditions.
How does psilocy-
state can lead patients
to find new perspective
on events in their past.
Indeed, it may be through
reconnection with the past
that the benefits of psilo-
cybin are achieved, in line
with a newly proposed
feature of depression
called derailment, which
suggests that an inabil-
ity to identify with past
versions of yourself can
cause a loss of identity
and purpose which may
lead to depression.
Pharmacology versus
trial, patients with major
depressive disorder will
be randomised to receive
psilocybin at varying
dosages and six weeks
of daily escitalopram or
placebo, with all patients
participating in guided
psychotherapy. The ef-
fectiveness of both treat-
ments will be determined
through self-assessed
questionnaires on depres-
sive symptoms as well as
fMRI scans of the brain,
paying special attention to
areas of the brain sensitive
to emotional stimuli.
cybin has been found to
cause increased amygdala
activation in response to
both negative and positive
visual stimuli and the
strength of this activation
predicted reductions in
the severity of symptoms
in patients with treat-
ment-resistant depression.
The attenuation of visually
stimulated amygdala acti-
vation in patients receiv-
ing antidepressants and
enhancement in patients
receiving psilocybin gives
credence to the hypothesis
that psilocybin can put
patients with depression
back in touch with their
emotions.
Using fMRI to study
how psilocybin and SSRIs
canalleviatethesymptoms
of depression despite
their different mechanism
in the brain can offer
researchers insights into
the complex neurobiology
of these conditions. fMRI
also offers researchers a
chance to more objective-
ly assess the magnitude
of relief from depressive
symptoms and, by
combining this analysis
with questionnaires,
conclusively demonstrate
the therapeutic potential
of psilocybin-assisted
psychotherapy. When
the results of this study
are published it will be
interesting to see, not
only which treatment
offered the most benefit
to patients, but also what
aspects of the psyche-
delic-trip can predict the
best outcomes for patients
and if these meaningful
experiences can be sought
out and encouraged in our
daily lives.

terest in psychedelic
compounds?
It may surprise you
to know that the idea of
using psychedelics during
psychotherapy has been
around for some time,
and can be traced back to
the modern rediscovery
of psychedelics in the
1940s and 50s. Less
than 10 years after its
rediscovery by renowned
chemist Albert Hoffman,
psilocybin was already
being synthesised in com-
mercial labs and sold as a
novel psycho-therapeutic
drug under the brand
name indocybin, sharing
a place on the shelf with
over-the-counter LSD,
branded as Delysid.
Despite showing promise
as psychotherapeutics
bin-assisted psycho-
therapy work?
The experiences that
follow taking a psyche-
delic are highly contextual
and deeply personal, the
word psychedelic is itself
derived from the Greek
words psyche (mind) and
dēlos (manifest), alluding
to the highly individual
effects of taking these
molecules. The types of
experiences that partic-
ipants encounter during
guided sessions can vary
hugely, but cases of rec-
onciliation with past grief,
deep personal introspec-
tion or feelings of bliss
are consistently reported.
This is an important
factor in the treatment
mechanism of the psy-
chedelic therapy model.
Rather than blunting the
emotions of patients with
depression, which is a
commonly reported side
effect of antidepressants,
psilocybin-assisted psy-
chotherapy has granted
them insights into the
emotional root of their
issues, with some patients
revealing that they had
achieved one of the most
significant emotional
breakthroughs of their
lives during psilocybin-as-
sisted psychotherapy. It is
easy then to misinterpret
psilocybin as a wonder
drug which can fast-track
the benefits of visiting a
psychologist or taking an-
tidepressants, which often
require months of sessions
or repeat prescriptions to
achieve results. But this
is not the case, psilocybin
is thought to push the
brain into a more flexible
state wherein negative
thought patterns can be
loosened and through
heightened association
new personal insights can
be uncovered. Combined
with the support of trained
therapists, the psychedelic
psychedelics
Rather than aiming to
treat a single chemical
imbalance in the brain,
as do traditional antide-
pressants, called selective
serotonin re-uptake inhib-
itors (SSRIs), psilocybin
assisted psychotherapy
uses the brain states
created through altering
that chemistry to bring
about lasting emotional
improvement. But how
good is it? Does the psy-
chological benefit persist
or do patients relapse
shortly afterwards? The
lack of head-to-head
comparison has so far
prevented researchers
from objectively quan-
tifying the benefit of
psychedelics versus anti-
depressants. This is where
the clinical trial at ICL
comes into play. In this
“Does the
psychological
benefit persist
or do patients

As previous research
has shown, depressed
patients show greater acti-
vation of the amygdala, an
area of the brain sensitive
to emotional stimuli,
when they are confronted
with visual stimuli that
evoke negative reactions,
such as angry or fearful
faces, a response that is
dampened by antidepres-
sants. Conversely, psilo-

The revival of measles
Measles is on the rise in the wake of the popularisation of ‘anti-vaxxer’ rhetoric, decreasing herd immunity, and
increasing risk. Make sure you are protected!

hen Max
was 18, he
woke up
one morn-
ing feeling very unwell.
“I just couldn’t get up,”
he said, “I had been out
the night before and my
boyfriend at the time
thought it was just a
hangover, but his flatmate
came in and said I looked
truly awful.” Eventually,
Max was taken in a taxi
to Whitechapel Hospital.
It was there that he was
diagnosed with measles.
Now 28 and a freelance
art director, Max is lucky
enough to have made
a full recovery. He did,
however, miss the first six
weeks of his degree. “I’ve
kind of blocked it out, I
was so unwell. I had just
started an art degree, and
I was away for nearly half
the term,” he recalled.
“We have all
been urged to
check that we
have had two
doses of the
MMR jab.”
“There are
plenty of
reasons a
student may
have missed
their MMR, not
just as a result
of vaccine
hesitancy’.”
Despite having been on
the brink of elimination
in 2015, unfortunately
measles cases like Max’s
are once again on the rise
in the UK. Last week,
Imperial students were
informed by email of
an outbreak in the local
community. As a result,
we have all been urged
to check that we have
had the recommended
two doses of the MMR
(Measles, Mumps and
Rubella) jab. But the
reasons why we may have
missed out on having the
vaccine as children are not
straightforward.
We all think we know
the story. “In 1998,
Andrew Wakefield
published a, now discred-
ited, paper linking the
MMR to autism,” Public
Health trainee Dr Cath-
erine Huntley explains,
“leading to intense media
coverage, which had
an important impact on
MMR coverage.” Those
children who missed out
on having the MMR as
a result of the scandal
are now populating UK
universities. “This group
of people is more suscep-
tible to measles because
immunity levels are low,”
Dr Huntley continues.
As a result of the
scandal, the latest wave of
measles cases can, in part,
be attributed to Andrew
Wakefield. And vaccine
hesitancy, as it is politely
known, is thriving once
again. Social media is
bringing together com-
munities of so-called ‘an-
ti-vaxxers’, feeding them
fake news and fuelling
scepticism of expert
opinion (which, for the
record, is that the MMR
vaccine is very safe). It is
the perfect populist storm.
Or at least, this is the story
we read in the papers.
But the ‘anti-vaxxers’
are only partly to blame.
There are other reasons
why Imperial students
might have missed their
MMR: a childhood spent
living overseas, or a
change of GPs at a critical
moment. I grew up in
London, yet I only had
my MMR when I arrived
at Imperial. My parents
simply forgot to take me
for my jabs. Max, too,
did not miss his MMR
on purpose - his family
moved to the UK from
Hong Kong when he was
six and his records got lost
on the way.
Fear of being bran-
dished as an ‘anti-vaxx-
er’, or an assumption that,
because you have pro-vac-
cine parents, that you
must have had the MMR,
may in fact be acting as
barriers to checking that
you’re covered. Instead,
it’s possible that, like Max
and me, you just slipped
through the net. It will
only take one phone call
to your GP surgery for
you to find out. If you
don’t have a family doctor
or you’re unable to find
out your immunisation
history, Dr Huntley says
“You can go ahead and
arrange to be vaccinated
again”. It is safer to do
this than to potentially be
left unprotected.
I asked Max what
advice he would give to
someone trying to decide
whether or not to have the
MMR. “I would definitely
have it,” he said. “Measles
is a horrible sickness to
have. It’s very contagious
and can be dangerous
to others.” Measles is
preventable, and it will
take little effort to check
that you’re protected.
So, don’t be afraid, don’t
assume, just go and check.
It is only together that
we can bring an end to
measles in the UK.
