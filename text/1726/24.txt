A
t the beginning
of last year
MiFID II was
i n t r o d u c e d
to make the financial
industry more transparent.
One key aspect of this is
the move from bundled
to unbundled products
brokerage firms provide.
Previously, a fund man-
ager buying a security
through a broker would
pay a hefty commission.
This would cover the cost
of putting the buyer and
seller parties together as
well as the research that
the brokerage firm provid-
ed to the fund to educate
it on which security to
buy. The research and
transaction were bundled
under one cost, hence, the
firms provided bundled
products. This research
would include access to
analysts who specialise
in specific asset classes
and industries, libraries
of thousands of research
papers as well as of
meetings with executives.
However, this provides a
dark cloud under which
these brokerage firms
operate. Who do they
represent and are they
providing the best deal
for their customers? This
is where MiFID II is
supposed to shake up the
research to remain unique
and competitive following
the introduction of the
legislation. So have their
radical expectations been
met? It has certainly had
a global effect. A recent
report from Greenwich
Associates found that
many US investment
managers are contemplat-
ing, under pressure from
their clients, unbundling.
This is thought to be due
not only to the fact that
any fund manager moving
money for European
clients has to comply with
MiFID II but also the
increase in transparency
is seen as the way forward
in financial legislation.
MiFID II is also reshaping
the industry. With research
firms having to offer
more bespoke services to
clients, meaning fewer an-
alysts covering a specific
niche in the market, many
analysts fear the security
of their career. With
decreasing demand and
increasing competition, as
fund managers decrease
their dependency on larger
all round brokerage firms,
many will perish in the
struggle to come out on
top. A clear indication of
this shift is the comment
Richard Buxton, Cheif
Executive of Old Mutual
Global Investors Cheif,
makes in the Financial
Times article MiFID II
leads to an exodus of sell-
side analysts, in which
he states his firm has
become “inundated with
CVs”. Who would blame
them when JP Morgan
is offering access to its
equity research for as
little as $10,000 yearly.
Fear not though, for it is
not all doom and gloom.
MiFID II has paved a
way for a brighter future,
especially for smaller
brokerage firms. Their
ability to provided very
detailed analysis on a
market niche gives them
the edge over their larger
dominant counterparts.
As Mahesh Narayan at
Thomson Reuters states
in an interview with
Finextra, smaller firms
industry. Under this legis-
lation brokerage firms are
nowobligedtoseparatethe
charges for operating the
transaction and providing
research and additionally
show how they acted
optimally for their client.
Consequently, the two
services must be offered
separately as an unbun-
dled product. This leads
to some very important
questions. How do you
value financial research?
Does this mean the end
for brokerage firms?
How will this affect the
global financial industry?
Specialised Firms Before
the implementation of
MiFID II, with the finan-
cial industry travelling in
such an ambiguous direc-
tion, uncertainty was ripe.
Brokerage and research
firms knew there was
a rocky road ahead. As
Bloomberg Intelligence
analysts Alison Williams
and Sarah Jane Mahmud
report in their article at the
end of last year, MiFID
II: Financial industry’s
disruption on a global
scale, “Investor relations
may need to scale up
activities with fewer
analysts covering fewer
companies.” Essentially,
they highlight that re-
search firms will need to
refine and specialise their

can “distinguish them-
selves by the quality of
their research”. While
MiFID II has certainly
transformed the European
financial industry it has
restored client confidence
in an out-dated sector, in
terms of the legislature,
by providing transpar-
ency and fairness for all
involved.
