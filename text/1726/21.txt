WhenTheySeeUs:AvaDuVernay’s‘CentralParkFive’
mini-series asks us to bear witness to painful truths
A
t the outset of
When They See
Us, we meet a
group of young
Harlem boys. Kevin
Richardson (Asante
Blackk), the youngest, is
a musical talent encour-
aged by his older sister
to put Spring Break to
good use - he could be as
good as Miles Davis one
day. Korey Wise (Jharrel
Jerome) is sixteen and
in the throes of a high
school romance. Along
with Yusef Salaam (Ethan
Herisse), Raymond
Santana (Marquis
Rodriguez) and Antron
McCray (Caleel Harriss)
they join in with a throng
of boys headed to Central
Park. At dusk, dozens
strong,thiscrowing,joyful
crowd runs into the park,
raising a ruckus in their
wake. Even without prior
knowledge of the real-life
fates of ‘The Central Park
Five’ we expect tragedy
to strike because we are
conditioned to know that
especially in film, but also
in life, unbridled shows of
freedom rarely go unpun-
ished, particularly not for
kids who look like Kevin,
Korey, Yusef, Raymond
and Antron.
In the park, jubilance
quickly sours to some-
thing with an edge -
scraps break out amongst
the group; when the
police show up, the boys
scatter, stumbling through
the undergrowth. Unbe-
knownst to them, across
the park, Trisha Meili
(Alexandra Templer) has
been dragged off the path
whilst jogging, brutally
raped and left for dead.
Faced with the task of
finding Meili’s assailant
and with no leads save for
a conference room full of
black teenagers arrested
for “unlawful assembly”,
Detective Linda Fairstein
(Felicity Huffman) seizes
an opportunity.
What follows is a
lesson in the lethal chasms
in modern American life.
Farstein, who is white and
middle aged, is unable to
correctly parse the slang
phrase “wiling out”,
written on a report of the
boys’ activities, to mean
“acting out”. Instead, she
becomes convinced the
children were “wilding”.
The kids held in custody
quickly turn from possible
witnesses to the rape
to probable suspects.
Farstein condemns the
twelve and thirteen year
olds out too late, to be feral
animals on the rampage.
With swift and profound
venom she labels the
children, whose names she
cannot remember, thugs
and predators - scum to
scrubbed away.
During the four part
series, we witness ‘The
Central Park Five’ being
convicted, imprisoned,
and then in 2002, acquit-
ted after a spontaneous
confession from a serial
rapist. Ava DuVernay’s
emotive direction which
puts the viewer in the
place of the five accused,
makes When They See Us
intensely painful viewing
- I found it difficult to
watch each episode all
the way through in one
go. Beyond an indictment
of the police officers who
intimidate and lie to force
confessions from the
teenagers, this mini-series
is wider commentary on
“They will lie
on us. They
will lock us up.
They will kill
us”
the power of privilege
in America. Huffman
proves a genius bit of (un-
intentional) meta-casting,
as her real life college ad-
missions scandal simmers
off screen, her presence is
a constant reminder that
the law views all as equal,
but some more equal than
others. The young actors
playing the principal
five are extraordinary in
portraying children whose
innocence is quickly
chipped away by pain,
amongst them, Jharrel
Jerome, who played ad-
olescent Kevin in Moon-
light, gives a particularly
shining performance.
Quite by chance this
week I was reading about
Charles Foster, an Oxford
professor who lived a
summer as a badger
(including eating worms
and crawling about on all
fours through the Welsh
countryside). Foster, by
his own explanation, had
undertaken this unconven-
tional exercise as a way of
stripping away the trap-
pings of what it meant to
be human - to ally himself
with the bestial parts of
his being (though not of
course, it must be said, to
the extent of eschewing a
book deal or several in-
terviews with high profile
national newspapers). I
couldn’t get Foster out
of my head as I watched
When They See Us. What
better delineates what
privilege really means?
A white, well regarded
lawyer, spends months in
a dug out “sett”, feasting
on worms and is called
an eccentric, profound,
free thinker; a group of
black children from the
projects come home late
from school and are called
savage animals by public
officials, and locked away
for decades for a crime
they did not commit.
do anything”, Antron’s
father tells his son in one
of the most powerful
scenes of the first episode,
begging him to falsely
confess: “They will lie
on us. They will lock us
up. They will kill us”.
Those of us who have
never had to live under
the oppression of being
institutionally cornered,
have never had the burden
of knowing that truth
means nothing in the face
of the colour of one’s skin
or where one grew up, can
never really understand
the trauma that inflicts.
DuVernay’s filmmaking
confronts each viewer
with the desperation of a
life like this.
the realisation that so little
seems to have changed
since 1989. In the United
States today, black Amer-
icans are five times more
likely to be incarcerated
than white Americans.
In 2015, though African
Americans and Hispanics
made up approximately
32% of the US popula-
tion, they comprised 56%
of all those incarcerated.
Far from being consigned
to history, thirty years
on from the Central Park
jogger case, the spectre of
justice inequality between
those who have societal
power and those who do
not looms just as large.
