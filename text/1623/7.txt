E-Cigarette claims go up in smoke
Q
uitting smoking is one
of the most common
New Year’s resolutions
and there are seemingly
endless methods claiming
to help one quit, from patches to
gum to spray; even hypnosis is
used to help people kick the habit.
However, recently e-cigarettes
have been used to wean people off
‘normal’ cigarettes, which many
consider more harmful than the
electronic equivalent. The public
health charity Action on Smoking
and Health estimate that of the 2.6
million people using e-cigarettes,
1.1 million are ex-smokers, with
increase of e-cig users between 2014
and 2015 being almost entirely from
ex-smokers.
However, the University of
San Francisco has released data
showing that e-cigarettes are not
actually as effective as believed
when it comes to stopping smoking.
Findings published in The Lancet
Respiratory Medicine show that
using e-cigarettes to aid attempts
to quit smoking actually has the
opposite effect. The researchers
in San Francisco collected and

trials, as well as a range of age
demographics, number of previous
quitting attempts and nicotine
dependence.
The researchers also presented
a possible reason that e-cigarettes
are ineffective when used to help
quitters; in this case, the cause
can be found in the e-smoker’s
psychology. The drop in the use
of traditional cigarettes over the
last 50 years is generally attributed
to the introduction of policies to
discourage smoking. Warnings
on packaging, increased taxation
and the ban on indoor smoking in
public places, have made smoking
more inconvenient and corroded its
“cool” image. However, e-cigarettes,
while regulated, are largely free of
the same stigma and are considered
to be less harmful. The paper states
that “The inclusion of e-cigarettes
in smoke-free laws and voluntary
smoke-free policies could help
decrease use of e-cigarettes as a
cigarette substitute, and, perhaps,
increase their effectiveness for
smoking cessation.”
Right now very few of the current
smoking laws apply to e-cigarettes,
allowing the devices to be used as a
crutch for smokers rather than tools
that enable quitting. “The irony is
that quitting smoking is one of the
A
ll the festive meals and
drinks plaguing the
holiday period, often
have a substantial effect
on our post holiday figure. Sure,
we make New Year’s resolutions to
hit the gym and become fitter, but
how many of us still struggle to
fit into that pair of skinny jeans?
Well, if you’re still finding your
jeans a bit too snug post Christmas,
you can probably hold your genes
responsible for it.
A research team of biologists
at Heidelberg University gained
new insight into how our feeding
behaviour is encoded in our genes.
The team led by Prof. Dr. Lohmann
of the Centre for Organismal
Studies (COS), studied the
model fruit fly (D. melanogaster),
and looked at the function of a
particular developmental gene
which belongs to the Hox gene
family. Hox genes are responsible
for controlling the development
of an embryo along the head-tail
axis. In a sense, the Hox genes
could be described as the body's
'architect' which is responsible for
the physiological blueprint of an
organism. However, this new study
revealed that a particular gene in the
Hox family, known as ‘Deformed’,
plays a crucial role in controlling
our feeding behaviour. This specific
gene is responsible for establishing
the feeding motor unit during the
development of the embryo.

main reasons both adults and kids
use e-cigarettes, but the overall
effect is less,not more,quitting,”said
one co-author Stanton A. Glantz,
UCSF professor and director of the
UCSF Center for Tobacco Control
Research and Education. Even
more worrying, further research
from UCSF shows than the use of
e-cigarettes may still have negative
impacts on people’s health, which
are currently not widely known.
Dr. Karen Wilson, chair of the
American Academy of Paediatrics
(AAP) section on Tobacco Control
argued, “The presence of nicotine
in e-cigarettes is highly dangerous
for the developing brains of the
youth”, which is especially troubling
considering people under 25
generally use e-cigarettes at a much
higher rate than other age groups.
So for those students looking to
look after their lungs in 2016, it’s
probably safer and more effective
for you to stick to the gum or go
cold turkey, rather than trying to
vape in the back of a lecture hall.

In the study, the Deformed gene
was deactivated when the feeding
motor unit was successfully formed
after embryogenesis which revealed
that this gene is also responsible
for controlling the motor unit even
during later phases of life.

A coastal approach to the plastic problem
Imperial College research suggests we should change our clean up methods
W
hen we think of
plastic pollution
in our oceans, it’s
common for our
first thoughts to be of a poor turtle
squished within a tight plastic ring,
or of the infamous Great Pacific
Garbage Patch - a massive swirling
vortex of plastic bags, bottle caps,
fibres from synthetic clothing, and
so on, found smack in the middle of
the Pacific Ocean.
Estimated at over 100 million
tonnes and twice the size of the
entire United Kingdom, most of the
plastic in the patch has been broken
down into microscopic pieces –
microplastics – that can persist for
hundreds, if not thousands of years,
continuing to poison and kill ocean
and avian wildlife indiscriminately.
The toxins in the plastics also
enter the earth’s food chain when
ingested by animals, passing the
dangerous chemicals continually
through our planet’s food webs
and ecosystems. A recent analysis
by Imperial College’s Dr. Erik van
Sebille and colleagues in Australia
showed that more than 90 per cent
of seabirds have swallowed plastics.
To date, much of the research
focus on ocean plastic pollution has
been on how to clean up this Great
Pacific Garbage Patch and others
that exist in almost every ocean in
the world. There are well-meaning
initiatives like The Ocean Cleanup –

which is based in the Netherlands –
that aim to deploy plastic collectors
at these environmentally toxic sites
to directly clean up and remove the
pollution from the ocean.
However, newly published
research from The Grantham
Institute’s Dr. van Sebille and
undergraduate physics student
Peter Sherman actually shows that
it might be more efficient to focus
on cleaning up at the point of entry
for pollution. That is, it’s better to
set up plastic collectors directly at
coastlines where plastic garbage is
being washed out, not out in the
oceans where it’s already being
broken down into toxic chemicals
and waste.
“There is a lot of plastic in the
patch, but it’s a relative dead zone
for life compared with the richness
around the coasts,” said Sherman.
The birds analysed in the earlier
study by Dr. van Sebille are also
concentrated around coasts where
their food is plentiful.
The new study by Dr. van Sebille
and Sherman, released just this
Tuesday in Environmental Research
Letters, shows how the researchers
studied the movement of plastics in
the ocean to figure out where was
best to deploy plastic collectors and
prevent the most harm to wildlife
and ecosystems.
Modelling a ten year project
starting in 2015, they found that
plastic collectors placed at strategic
entry points along coastlines
would remove over 30% of the
microplastics, as opposed to the
17% removal rate if collectors
were placed at the garbage patches
themselves. This proposed system
of floating barriers and platforms
would concentrate, collect, and
remove plastics flowing into the
ocean from urban rivers, sewers,
and waste deposits before they even
had the chance to disperse into the

currents and end up in these large
concentrations of garbage patches.
“The Great Pacific garbage patch
has a huge mass of microplastics,but
the largest flow of plastics is actually
off the coasts, where it enters the
oceans,” said Sherman.
“It makes sense to remove plastics
where they first enter the ocean
around dense coastal economic
and population centres,” added
Dr van Sebille. “It also means you
can remove the plastics before they
have had a chance to do any harm.
Plastics in the patch have travelled
a long way and potentially already
done a lot of harm.”
The authors identified this
system of coastline collectors as
particularly useful around China
and some Indonesian islands.
These two countries were also
recently identified as two out of five
countries, also including Vietnam,
the Philippines and Thailand,
that contribute nearly 60% of
global oceanic plastic pollutions,
in a report released last week from
McKinsey and Company and the
Ocean Conservancy.
The McKinsey report also
confirmed that over 80% of oceanic
debris actually comes from land-
based sources of pollution, not
oceanic ones like fishing vessels or
cruise ships. Most of it comes from
litter and debris on the land or in
waterways that eventually wash
out to the ocean. In light of this,
the research from Imperial College
pointing out the greater efficiency
and success in reducing plastic
pollution by ultimately stopping it
at the coastal sources is even more
relevant and timely.
“We need to clean up ocean
plastics, and ultimately this should
be achieved by stopping the source of
pollution,”said Sherman.“However,
this will not happen overnight, so a
temporary solution is needed, and
clean-up projects could be it, if they
are done well.”
