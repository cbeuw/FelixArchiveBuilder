Is opera more than ‘fur coats and no knickers’?

E
ver watched ice-cream
being made in a factory?
A quick YouTube and a
bit of cornetto should give
you the full effect of my feelings as I
stormed up the stairs (“Latecomers
will NOT be admitted”) to the
opera La Traviata at the Royal
Opera House.
Maybe I just have a little crush
on good engineering, but there’s
definitely a tingle to think that a
bunch of monkeys with firesticks
have advanced to such a fantastic
extent that whole herds of them can
spend their lives building machines
to endlessly produce the perfect
level of chocolate flakes in a Mr.
Whippy.That tap of your tongue on
a lump of frozen milk is someone’s
lifetime problem. Isn’t that crazy?
On the other hand, after
having lustfully gulped down
someone’s career, there’s something
disgustingly pointless about it all.
Something pretty disturbing – in
a dark old world – that we’d waste
such a glut of care on icecream.

harder, changed more - for love of
an ice-cream?
Or, to quote my wise old
Grandma, is opera just “all fur coat
and no knickers.”?
La Traviata, billed as “everything
that opera should be about” ...”an
intense workout of your love and
fear muscles”, seemed the best
opportunity to settle the question.
The plot revolves around the
struggles of a Parisian courtesan
Violetta, (Venera Gimadieva,
debut) and her (forbidden) love
for a nobleman, Alfredo Germont
(Samuel Sakker).
Violetta’s slow decline and
eventual death from consumption
(tuberculosis) forms the crux of
the play, while Alfredo’s family do
everything possible to prevent the
union of the happy couple.
That plot has undeniably faded.
The 19th
century social mores of
marriage and chastity that Verdi
rebelled against are long broken. It
took thirty years for Verdi’s opera to
be performed in it’s original form.
So, (as much as Traviata is a
staple) it seems deeply ironic that
the current,very carefully‘authentic’,
form of the ROH’s production
absolutely demolishes the author’s
basic intent to challenge. All that
remains in the wreck is a fairly
standard tale of romance lost and a
history lesson.

The emotion in this performance
is left in the force of the music, and
not the words. This is just as well,
because the acting itself is fairly
robotic. There’s obviously a need to
balance vocal talent with dramatic
ability, and that decision is always
going to be weighted pretty heavily
towards the former. Granted too,
the size of the auditorium also
means that unless gestures are
exaggerated, they’ll be missed by a
fair proportion of the audience.
However, messing up a stage
slap simply isn’t great, nor does an
imitation of a windmill do anything
to convince me of a broken heart.
If I’d said this at the ROH, I’d
probably have been staked by some
hefty pearls and a stiletto. In no way
do I deny the technical, vocal ability
of the cast. The crisp vocal power of
Venera (Violetta) was outstanding
in particular.
However, I can’t shake the feeling
that for the audience last Saturday,
the real attraction of La Traviata,
became not La Traviata, but a seat
in Covent Garden.
To my mind, I think I’d rather
close my eyes and listen to the
music.
