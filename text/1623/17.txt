The sculptures in gallery 8, such
as a striking minotaur, explore how
man and animal reflect each other,
and seem to subtly mirror the soft
red clay tones which can also be
found in Paik’s drawings in the same
gallery. The material Stephanie
Quayle used to create her pieces –
organic red clay sourced by man for
centuries to create - enhances the
exploration of the antiquity of the
relationship between man and beast.
Several works – notably those of
Mia Feuer, Soheila Sokhanvari,
and Maha Malluh in Gallery 3 –
illuminate political issues or bring
our attention to the lasting and
consequential impact of human
actions. These works act to unmask
these consequences – we are forced
to come face to face with the realities
of human actions, which many
are not aware of or avoid thinking
about. Also notable are the works
of Suzanne McClelland conveying
data sets which can pertain to
body builders and terrorists. These
works hint at a duality of life and
are evasively ominous in both their
contents and their atmosphere ,
created by blurry shadows and dark
colours.
I found Champagne Life to be the
perfect exhibition chosen to mark
the grand occasion of Saatchi’s
anniversary, as it demonstrates
Saatchi’s mission and commitment
its
showcase
of unique
perspectives
makes this
exhibition
definitely not
one to be
missed
to supporting female artists.Though
this is just one small step (and just
one single exhibition) in the greater
scheme of things, it is at least a step
in the right direction.
Moreover, this exhibition brings
much needed attention to the
reality of the issue. Shockingly,
some still believe that the glass
ceiling for women is a myth, despite
global statistics. Only one woman
has ever headlined Coachella, solo
exhibitions by female artists have
only made up 25% of the Tate
Modern’s roster since 2007, and so
on ad infinitum.
I truly hope that Champagne
Life’s aura of liberation and of a
brighter future for female artists
isn’t a false promise.
Overall the unique perspectives
and original creativity of each
showcased artist, taken together
with this mission, makes
Champagne Life an empowering
and inspirational exhibition.
Definitely not one to miss.
Champagne Life is at the Saatchi
Gallery until 19th
March.

Privilege paves way to success for aspiring actors

Unsurprisingly, it appears
privilege is a key to success on
the silver screen. In an interview
with the Radio Times, the actor
and Lannister poster boy Charles
Dance came out saying that
state educated actors have fewer
opportunities than those from the
are a rarity.
But do not rush to judgement. For
the few who make it, it is talent and
training that get them there. For
many the training comes at drama
school and part of this is having
exposure and guidance to life on the
stage. I went to a private sixth form
and I can tell you that the drama
experience is staggering. A former
director in residence at Eton, our
head of drama had worked for the
and on. Despite making up 7% of
the general population,the privately
educated are crammed in at the
higher echelons of theatre and film.
In a sense it’s self-fulfilling. A
career as an actor remains one where
the right contacts and the right
agent are invaluable. As a nobody,
audition after audition dominates
your day to day with rare success,
but past a certain level the top jobs
are just handed out – newcomers
National Theatre, the Liverpool
Everyman, Shakespeare’s Globe
and trained in direction at RADA.
Whether you like it or not, that
influence and experience has a
remarkable effect on a young actor.
My experience at the NationalYouth
Theatre pales into insignificance
when compared with the skill and
budget offered by the top private
schools. No training before or after
that has taught me as much and I
imagine the same influenced many
of today’s actors. Talented or not,
actors from the top private schools
are backed by an unrivalled support
and training network that simply
isn’t available to the less privileged.
Yet that still doesn’t justify the
huge gap at the top. Life as an actor

private sector. What a revelation!
So many of the big names have the
badge of privilege. That’s not to say
some aren’t great actors, but still,
44% of people in TV, film or music
are privately educated, I wonder –
why the disparity?
In his interview, Dance highlights
Eddie Redmayne and Dominic
West as actors whose Eton
background give them an extra
charm and confidence to hit the
stage - but there are many more.

Laurie,Emily Blunt…I could go on
is competitive and for the 2% who
make a living from it, there is whole
lot of hardship on the way there. If
you can’t afford to stick to it and wait
for your break, you’ll never make
a career out of it. As long as the
privileged can pay their way through
the years of unsustainable London
life, the disparity will continue.
More needs to be done to close the
gap and make a career in acting
possible to the underprivileged, but
in the current anti-arts climate, that
won’t be happening soon.

We’ve heard you were a victim.
Stop crouching in shadows, chewing your hair.
You can be graceful, not like a ballerina,
like a hedge of coral,
Built up and eaten and worn down
yet alive, carving the rhythms of the seas.
You can be a threshing sledge,
new and sharp with many teeth.

Sexism in the arts doesn’t make for a pretty picture
Chronic under-representation of female artists across the world is robbing us of great artwork
I
f you’re thinking that a whole
exhibition devoted to women
is a an unreasonable amount
of positieve discrimination,
consider how many shows in the
Saatchi Gallery have featured
just men. There are no prizes for
guessing it’s more than one in 30
years.
Sexism is endemic in the art
world; of the top art institutions
in Westminster and the City of
London, out of 386 public works of
art; only 8% are created by women.
Only 31% of artists represented by
London galleries are women despite
72% of students studying Art in
London being female.
The Guerrilla Girls, rather
damningly, in their series Do Women
STILL Have to be Naked to Get
Into the Met. Museum? found that
in 2011, less than 4% of the artists
featured in the Art section of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York were women, but 76%
of the nudes are female. In fact,
the proportion of artists seems
to have actually declined from
the 5% representing every female
artist in 1984. Nothing else quite
so eloquently points out even now;
women are seen first as objects,
figures to pose rather than human
beings with things to say and ideas
to share.
Chronic under-representation
feeds into the arts market; in 2014
Artnet.com counted just five women
in the top 100 living artists based on
sales from 2011 to 2014. Passion,
not money matters to most artists,
but the gender pay gap means that
women are less likely to afford to
continue being full time artists.
Champagne Life has created
something of a trap for itself by
being a one-off exhibition. It risks
becoming a gimmick that will
be over by Spring, a token salute
to these women who have been
bundled together for no other
good reason than they share an
XX karyotype. These blockbuster
one-offs should be celebrated, but
should be recognized as merely the
first step in achieving real change.
The end of the exhibition should
not mean a return to the status quo
for the Saatchi and the rest of the
art world.
Until fair representation is
achieved in the top galleries year
round, it will be us, the public,

shows should
go further
to promote
equality in the
arts
that will be missing out on all the
fantastic art we could’ve enjoyed had
the art world got its act together.
