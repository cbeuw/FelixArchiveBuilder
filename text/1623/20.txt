C
orporate Social
Responsibility (CSR)
is a company’s sense of
responsibility towards
the community and environment in
which it operates.
To promote this idea, the Finance
Society organises an annual CSR
conference in which all Imperial
societies are invited to propose their
own charitable ideas and the winner
gets £1000 to make it a reality.
This year we teamed up with RAG
to bring you an even bigger and
better Charity Challenge 2016 and
we’re throwing in an extra £500 for
your society to spend as you please,
with the main presentation event
kicking off RAG week on the 8th
of
February!
What is a charitable
idea?
It can be anything, as long as
it costs £1000 to implement and
brings about positive change in the
world. You can organise an event to
raise more money and donate it to
a charity of your choice or you can
invent a clever device to filter water
to prevent disease in poor parts of
the world.
How do I take part?
You need to form a team and be
backed by an Imperial society. Your
idea needs to be submitted in the
form of one to two A4 pages or a
video lasting up to five minutes
video.
The proposal will need to carefully
address how the £1000 will be spent
and include the names of everyone
involved
The submission deadline is the
24th
January.
The winners will then be picked
Who knew these two would be buddying up?

Your society could win £500
If you can think of a charitable idea they’ll give you £1000 to make it happen
by the Imperial student body after a
week of voting.
This is an excellent opportunity for
societies to gain new membership as
each team must represent a society
and each society can only put
forward one team but there is no
limit on team size.
The Final
The top five teams will present
their ideas at the final and the
winner will be chosen by a panel
of independent judges (in the past
these have been representatives
from Morgan Stanley, Barclays,
Ernst & Young, Citi, Deutsche
Bank and Goldman Sachs). The
best part is that we will be providing
copious amounts of free pizza for
everyone attending and it’s all for a
good cause.
For more information on how to
submit your idea or vote please find
our Facebook event ICFS & RAG:
Charity Challenge 2016. We look
forward to your submissions and
seeing you at the final!
