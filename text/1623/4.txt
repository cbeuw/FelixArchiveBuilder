The Match4Lara campaign reaches Imperial
Stem cell donation drive hits SAF today
T
oday, the Anthony Nolan
branch at Imperial is
running a bone marrow
drive in an attempt to
find a match for a Thai-Italian
student, the 24 year old Lara
Casalotti, who has been diagnosed
with leukaemia.
The test involves nothing more
than writing down your details and
spitting into a cup – this will be
analysed to see whether volunteers
have the right tissue type to save
Lara’s life.
At the moment,only 3% of people
on the bone marrow register are
mixed race, which has meant that
a suitable match hasn’t yet been
found. 				
After no one in her family was a
match, Lara’s friends launched a
worldwide campaign to find a donor,
which has included huge drives on
several university campuses.
Last week, the Cambridge drive
recruited 656 people onto the
Anthony Nolan register, which
could also help hundreds of others

Junior Doctor strike won’t go ahead
Continuing negotiations means that the next strike has been cancelled
disorders, including leukaemia.
Last week, it was reported that a
Thai-Italian man took an eight hour
coach ride across Thailand to take
the test to see whether he could be
a match.
Despite its reputation, donating
stem cells is a lot like giving blood.
J
unior doctors will not strike
next week, the BMA have
announced, calling off
industrial action after it
resumed talks with the
government.
On Tuesday, the doctors’ union
said that continued negotiations
with NHS Employers via an
intermediary negotiation service,
ACAS, meant that planned strike
action for next week had been
suspended.
After last Tuesday’s strike which
lasted 24 hours, doctors were due
to strike again for 48 hours on the
26th
of January.The strike would not
have disrupted emergency care.
Another strike is still planned
for the 10th
of February if the
negotiations do not result in
“concrete progress”, the BMA have
said.The negotiations between the
government and the BMA have

and most
people say it’s
painless
Most people say it’s painless. Only
10% of donations actually involve
giving bone marrow, and these
procedures happen under a general
anaesthetic.
30% of people diagnosed with
blood cancers find a tissue match
with a member of their own family,
but the rest rely on donations from
strangers. At the moment, The
Anthony Nolan trust, the charity
that matches donors with those
who are ill, has 577,000 people on
its register.
The charity says it needs more
men, who make up only 15% of
the register but produce more stem
cells, and are more likely to donate
them if matched.
As highlighted in Lara’s case,
they are also in desperate need of
more donors from Black, Asian
and minority ethnic backgrounds.
People of non-Caucasian origin are
much less likely to find a stranger
with matching tissue, and only 20%
do.
The drive is running on Friday the
22nd
in SAF from 11:30 until 18:00

been tempestuous since last summer,
when they first broke down.
Should the Government strong-
arm the junior doctors by imposing
the original contract changes, the
changes would take place incredibly
quickly because the vast majority
of junior doctors are on short term
contracts, typically six or twelve
months. Their options would then
be to accept the contract, move
abroad to find employment or
find a job in the private sector. The
balance of the strikes ultimately lies
with public opinion which currently
strongly favours the position of
the medics. An Ipsos MORI poll
recently put their approval rating at
66%.
How Jeremy Hunt handles the
negotiations between now and the
next planned strike is likely to have
impacts not only on the NHS, but
on the wider public sector as well.
This is apparent with the ongoing
negotiations between London
Underground and its tube drivers.
Again,negotiations using the ACAS
service have been fruitful, with the
strike that was scheduled for the
same day as the suspended medics’
walkout, now too having been put
off. Peter Holden, chairman of East
Midlands Regional Council of the
BMA, cited this clash as part of the
reason that the doctors’ strike had
been suspended, highlighting the
fragile position the Government
was in.
Consultant contracts are also
up for renegotiation soon, and
considering the difficulty in reaching
an agreement for junior doctors, the
government is unlikely to be able to
spring another big change on the
profession.
