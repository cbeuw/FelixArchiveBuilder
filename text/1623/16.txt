hampagneLifeisnotyour
average contemporary art
exhibition, but the first
of its kind in Saatchi
Gallery’s history. Not only is it
staged to mark the Gallery’s 30th
anniversary, but it is also Saatchi’s
first major all-female exhibition.
The brochure claims the title itself
makes an ironical statement about
the illusory glamour of an artist’s
life.Hopefully that is the true reason
behind the title, and not the fact
that the exhibition’s main sponsor is
the champagne Pommery …
It is difficult to think of any
appropriate title for the exhibition
as the artistic purposes and
materials vary extensively. Though
the variation between the artists
is greater than any commonalities,
I felt that each artist succeeds
in effectively and impressively
conveying her own individual
message. This is definitely an
exhibition which will leave you with
a lasting and transformative impact
well after your visit.
The exhibition consists of the
works of 14 emerging international
women artists, providing 14 unique
reflections on the meaning of being
a female artist today. Each artist’s
purpose is honest, and this purpose
conveyed through their works in
a most creative, unexpected, and
original way.
Some of the works make
statements about the current
digital age and media culture. For
example, in the first gallery, we
instantly recognize the subjects of
“Champagne Life” – repetitions of
inverted Kim and Kanye painted
over with a green or yellow. The
fact that this unifying recognition
phenomenon is experienced by
all the viewers of the work, the
ability of Julia Wachtel’s work to
demonstrate and expose this almost
subconscious new ‘instinct’ created
by celebrity pop culture and the
Internet is truly incredible.
Maria Angeletti’s works in
gallery 6 also focus on the digital
and Internet age, but specifically
on its influence on artistic practice.

Champagne Life makes history by being the only exhibition in the gallery to feature just women
of images that seem juxtaposed,
but in fact may appear together in
a Google search. The images are
reproduced extensively in various
ways and spliced together, leaving
us to contemplate whether these
processes of contemporary image
culture distance the image from the
subject, or uncover a new profound
meaning in it. Contrastingly,Sigrid
Holmwood’s paintings illuminate
a forgotten Swedish traditional
life. The Impressionist style of the
artworks and the nineteenth century
subjects contrasts against the
psychedelic neon colours in which
they are done. The fluorescence
seems to put a vivid spotlight on
the vanished traditions, or perhaps
revives them with a new, refreshed
life.
Unconventionally, some works
in the exhibition make statements
about themselves. They act as
mediums to expose the act of
creation – a contemplation and
an exposure of the methods
undertaken by the artist to create
the work. In gallery 6, Julia Dault’s
sculptures bear marks and scratches
that resulted from the artist bending
and assembling the work, and thus
unmask the presence of the artist in
the work. The imprints left on the
Plexiglass hint at an unbreakable
bond between the creator and her
creation, and these imprints also
seem to give the cold industrial
material a touch of human warmth,
almost a sort of secret intimacy.
Similarly, Alice Anderson’s ‘181
kilometers’ bears testament to the
meditative and intensely physical
process undertaken by the artist to
create the work.
The works in gallery 4 bear
an existential essence. On the
walls are Jelena Bulajic’s works
- each a portrait of a person she’s
encountered who’s caught her
attention in some way.
Three of the portraits are so
large they almost fill a whole wall,
and the effect created by an aged
face in extremely accurate detail
is absolutely transfixing. Not
only are humans psychologically
predisposed to be drawn to faces,
the process of aging is inevitable
for all.Tapping into these two facts,
Bulajic’s portraits evoke a feeling of
empathy and of a haunting unity,
and the monumental size and detail
of the portraits make them even
further powerfully mesmerizing.
In the middle of gallery is the
sculpture “Echoué au seuil de la
raison” by Virgile Ittah.The flesh of
two bodies made of wax and
seeming to melt conveys Ittah’s
purpose in this work - to study the
“frailty and transience of human
flesh”.Thefactthatthebodiesalmost
hang in suspension further invites

us to reflect upon this transience
between being and nothingness.The
figures seem to reach for each other,
and this perhaps adds the subtle
metaphor of this inevitable part of
the human condition as unifying.
Seung Ah Paik’s floor to ceiling
drawings in gallery 8 are depictions
of her own flesh down to the most
unflattering details. Exposing the
imperfections of her own flesh
on a large scale is an unapologetic
statement of honesty – of not only
accepting but celebrating flaws as
reflections of one’s individuality and
identity.
Her work aims to show a self-
accepting take on beauty that
contrasts the current societal
obsession with illusory perfection.
The soft muted tones and technique
Paik used seem to further contrast
the digital and sharply focused
images of perfect bodies in the
media that women are constantly
bombarded with.Personally,I found
Paik’s works to evoke a feeling of
tenderness in response to the way in
which she depicts the female body
that is empowering and inspiring.
While Paik’s works focus on the
physical aspect of female identity,
Mequitta Ahuja’s paintings in
Gallery 7 convey her take on the
intangible aspects of identity. Being
ethereal, these facets of identity can
thus be presumed to be unfixed,
and Ahuja’s works aims to convey
a similar concept – that identity
is not static, but ours to fabricate.
Her paintings show figures
(often self-portraits) woven into
a mythological or ancient setting.
Personally, I felt the work “Stick
“Two Cows, 2013”, Stephanie Quayla. Photo: courtesy of the Saatchi Gallery, London.
Bulajic’s
transfixing
portraits
evoke a
sense of

unity
Stack” clearly conveys this concept.
The feeling of an ancient tradition
evoked by the earth-toned mosaic
– an ancient and traditional art –
contrasts strikingly to the body that
is depicted in the same traditional
style but is coloured bright blue.
The mosaic can be interpreted as a
metaphor for using bits and pieces
of tradition, culture, and the past
to reimagine these boundaries and
to create out of them a unique
identity. Moreover, the blue skin is
a symbol clearly demonstrating the
ability to create a personal identity
despite seemingly unchangeable
Let’s
hope this
promise of
a brighter
future for
female
artists isn’t
false
