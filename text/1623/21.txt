VIRGO
This week after coming back
from home with a massive
suitcase, you decide to take
the tube back home; however,
you are vaguely ethnic and
as a result are ‘randomly’
stopped and searched eleven
times. Fuck the police.

This week as the horoscopes
writer you would like to say
that you greatly admire the
police but then again you
are also as pale as the skies
of Ireland so you don’t really
need to worry about them.
Never been stopped in an
airport either.
This week you hope that the
lecture you’re currently in
whilst writing the horoscopes
will finish soon. Please all
lecturers, if you think reading
off your slides is good
teaching, just fuck off. Ugh.
This week you go on a boozy
tripto[REDACTED]buton
the coach there,everyone gets
pissed and [CENSORED]
in the [UNABLE TO
NAME FOR LEGAL
REASONS], resulting in
your permanent ban from the
English Channel. Ah well,
there’s always next year.
This week you remember all
your friends from school who
were applying for medicine
and who also voted for the
Conservatives. Oh boo hoo!
It’s not safe it’s not fair! I
haven’t got more money for
my guaranteed job! Sob.[This
is not the official view of
FELIX.None of this is.-Ed.]
This week you misspell
something after previously
having mocked students for
their poor English skills.
Maybe you should learn
too (sic) practice what you
preach.
This week you realise instead
of relying on your student
loan for financial support you
should prioritise a little bit of
insurance fraud. You jump in
front of one of those wankers
with Range Rovers; however,
they don’t slow down as
Wholefoods awaits and you
end up in a full body cast.
This week you would like
to remind everyone that
Saudi Arabia is still an awful
place that doesn’t care about
human rights and that Great
Britain supported their entry
into the UN’s Human Rights
Council. I wonder if oil
money had anything to do
with that…
This week you’re a bottle top
in the centre of the garbage
patch in the Pacific ocean.
Your life is carefree and yet
monotonous; you long for an
existence outside the giant
vortex of trash. One day you
escape, make friends with sea
creatures and fall in love. You
sell the film rights to Pixar.
This week you are excited
about the massage you’re
going to receive courtesy of
the NHS; however, your idea
of a beautiful lady masseuse
is quickly eradicated when
Keith from Durham asks you
to strip to the waist and pats
your bottom.
This week, you do a naughty
thing but then tweet about
it! So people find out! That
was silly! Don’t do that again!
#atleastnoban
This week you are a genetics
professor. Why weren’t any
black people nominated
at the Oscars, you wonder.
John Boyega in Star Wars?
Everyone involved in
Straight Outta Compton? It
upsets you, deeply. You have
reformed.
