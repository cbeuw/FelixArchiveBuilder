Rewind time with Life Is Strange
M
any people often find
themselves reflecting
on their past choices,
given the knowledge
that they have now. Our teenage
years are characterised by the
mistakes and lessons learnt, shaping
us into the ‘adults’ we are today.
Undoubtedly, some mistakes bear
significantly worse repercussions
than others and real life has
no second chances. Games are
appealing to us because we can kill,
fail and die with no consequences
affecting our real lives. Life Is
Strange challenges the idea that
games don’t affect us personally; it
forces us to make harsh decisions
that have the ability to haunt the
player beyond the computer screen.
Life is Strange is a game that
encompasses the trials of being a
teenager and the burden of being a
superhero. Developed by DontNod
Entertainment and published by
Square Enix in 2015, it is a five part
episodic journey which explores the
difficult decisions many teenagers
encounter – with a twist. The
protagonist, Max Caulfield, one day
acquires the ability to manipulate
time and alter the fabric of reality.
Max and her childhood friend
Chloe Price embark on exciting
adventures, taking advantage of
(and even sometimes abusing)
Max’s new found power. However,
the story quickly evolves from a
heart-warming tale about the newly
renewed friendship of two teenage
girls to the horror of an impending
hurricane and subsequent fate of
their town.
The heroine Max Caulfield (played
by Hannah Telle) is a seemingly
average teenage girl. Armed with a
camera and creativity, she attends
the prestigious Blackwell Academy
in the hopes of pursuing a future
career in photography. Despite her
natural talent,her lack of confidence
keeps her in the shadows of her
peers. She is completely contrasted
by Chloe Price (Ashly Burch) who
is a recalcitrant spirit with electric
blue hair.The tag team combination
of a timid character and a rebellious
one is not uncommon in teenage
coming of age stories, because
it works. Life Is Strange is no
exception to this. There is also an
intriguing ensemble of secondary
characters, from filthy rich brats
to the wholesome and innocent. It

really is just like high school.
The game allows the player
to rewind the vast majority of
events, with each triggering
consequences that cascade onto
other consequences (The Butterfly
Effect for those familiar with
Chaos Theory). A decision that
the player makes in episode one
might not have visible effects until
episode four, leading to moments
of dramatic realisation. The choices
that the player can make are vast;
ranging from choosing between
having a bacon omelette or Belgian
waffle for breakfast to whether
or not they steal money from the
handicapped fund. There are several
‘points of no return’ throughout the
story at which the option to reverse
time is removed, forcing the player
to really think carefully about their
choices. Due to this, there is an ever
present feeling of trepidation. At
the end of each episode, worldwide
statistics are revealed that show how
people made their choices – one
of the game’s many quirks. Who
wouldn’t be curious to see what
percentage of people made the same
choices as you?
Every game features ‘filler’
moments that contribute little to
the overarching storyline, instead
existing solely to prolong it. In
the case of Life Is Strange, there
are several mini-games which are
generallyentertainingyetsometimes
mildly annoying. Among these,
in the third episode there is a part
that warrants furiously mashing the
keyboard in an attempt to solve a
seemingly randomly and extremely
frustrating puzzle. After finally
succeeding one hopes to never have
to go through that ordeal again
only to find out eventually that
the exact same puzzle will feature
no less than five times in the fifth
episode. Moreover, the game is not
without its fair share of glitches and
graphical imperfections. The speech
vaguely follows the movement
of the characters’ mouths at best,
nevertheless one still cannot help
but be impressed by the intricate
artwork. Another feature of Life Is
Strange that deserves praise is the
soundtrack; the indie instrumental
tunes, featuring musical talents such
as Foals and Syd Matters, keep the
player thoroughly engrossed in the
gameplay.
Life Is Strange is a triumph in
terms of storyline. There is much to
be desired in terms of smoothness of
gameplay, but this is a minor defect.
The ending is poignant and thought
provoking. Although the storyline
takes place over only five days, the
characters feel eerily familiar by the
end.
Life Is Strange is a must play
for those who are interested in
point and click adventure games.
Its episodic nature is perfect for
allowing yourself an acceptable
amount of procrastination one
evening, but proceed with caution –
it is entirely possible that you could
end up bingeing the entire five
episodes in one sitting.
