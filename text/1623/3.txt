Maintenance grants are no more
From September there will be no more maintenance money from the government that
doesn’t have to be paid back

O
n Tuesday, Labour’s
attempt to reverse the
government’s decision
to scrap maintenance
grants was foiled.
From September 2016, students
will only be able to access means-
tested loans, which they will have
to pay back once earning over the
£21,000 salary threshold.
At the moment around 500,000
students in England are given
means-tested grants to cover living
costs which don’t need to be paid
back. This equates to an increase of
£3500 of debt per year for students
from the lowest income households,
alongside their £9000 academic fees.
Many worry that this will put
off bright students from poorer
backgrounds from attending
university at all, given the threat of
such a financial burden.The average
home student who started a degree
in 2012 or later will leave university
with about £50,000’s worth of debt.
Representatives from the National
Campaign Against Fees and Cuts
were outside parliament awaiting
the decision, and when the news
broke that maintenance grants were
to be scrapped, students ‘occupied’
Westminster bridge.
With signs, reading ‘NO
GRANTS = NO BRIDGE’,
the protesters managed to block
the main thoroughfare from
Westminster to Waterloo for an
hour and a half, before police
successfully moved them along.
George Osborne has also been
accused of using the changes as
a political trick, one in which the
costs of the current student grants
are passed onto the government 30
years down the line. This is due to
the expenditure only being counted
when the student loans are written
off and not, as is the case now, when
the grants are first given out.
Osborne’s use of this loophole
allows him on paper to make huge
strides towards “balancing the
books by the end of this parliament”
despite just prolonging the cost.
Strong criticism was also voiced over
the way the government enacted
these changes, doing so without a
full commons debate via the process
of a “Statutory Instrument”.
This type of bill is usually used for
low-key policy change, not large-
scale overhauls, and meant that
a committee of just 18 MPs (10
CON, 6 LAB, 2 SNP) voted after
having a debate of just 90 minutes.
The final vote, 10-8, meant that
the last resort of reversing the
decision now lies with the House
of Lords, where a motion has been
called for in order to annul the
changes. It was a Lords vote that
overturned Osborne’s controversial
tax credit cuts late last year.

New financial threshold for non-EU students
You could be deported unless you earn £35,000 after graduation
T
his week pressure has
been growing on Home
Secretary, Theresa May,
to abandon plans to
deport non-EU immigrants who
are earning less than £35,000 a year
after 5 years of living in the UK.
The average UK-wide salary is
far lower than this threshold, at
£20,800 and a figure on the college’s
website put the average leavers’
salary across subjects in 2013 at
Imperial at £29,232.
A petition calling for the plans
to be scrapped has reached 78,000
signatures,with large concentrations
of signatures from London, but
also from university towns like
Bristol, Oxford, Cambridge and
Brighton. Joshua Harbord, who
set up the petition, said the policy
“unfairly discriminates against
charity workers, nurses, students
and others”.
Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal
Democrat home affairs spokesman,
also argued the point that the
arbitrary level “fails to take talent
and new sectors like tech start-ups,
whose staff might be paid less than
£35,000”
Petitions on the government’s
website are guaranteed a response
once they reach more than 10,000
signatures, but as seen on Monday
with the petition to ban Donald
Trump, they need 100,000
signatures to be considered for
debate in parliament.
After an outcry when these plans
were first announced in 2011,
several jobs were excluded from
this threshold. These include PhDs,
lecturers and nurses. There are also
some specific engineering jobs (such
as in the oil and gas industry) that
are on the government’s “Shortage
Occupation List”, whose entry
level salaries are usually below the
proposed threshold, but would be
exempt.
Proposals have also been made
that would mean UK companies
can’t bring in skilled workers from
outside the EU, unless they are paid
a starting salary of £30,000 as well
as paying a levy of £1,000 per year
for every non-EU hiring.
The plans unveiled in 2011 were
always planned for introduction in
April 2016, and are seen as a way
for David Cameron to reduce net
immigration from 250,000 to a
number “in the tens of thousands”.
