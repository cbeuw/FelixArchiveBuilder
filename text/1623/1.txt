L
ast week’s ICSM Boat
club’s annual trip to
Belgium ended before it
really even began – at the
ferry port in Dover.
Current medics and alumni were
prevented by P&O ferry staff from
boarding the boat which would have
taken them to mainland Europe, as
they were too drunk.
The students tried to board the
4:50am ferry from Dover to Calais
but were “drunk and disorderly”
according to port staff. P&O ferries
took the decision not to allow the
students to travel when they were
scheduled to.
In an email, sent as the students
were heading back to London
having been turned away, the club’s
captain told members that “[P&O]
were willing for us to be allowed on
after a 2-3 hour wait. Unfortunately,
the coach drivers were unwilling
to co-operate, hence are currently
driving us back to London”.
The trip from Hammersmith
to Dover had not been without
issue. The coach company’s depot
manager was first contacted by
the driver at 3:30am over the
students’ behaviour. The coach left
Hammersmith as scheduled at a
quarter past midnight on Saturday.
The coach company alleges that
some students caused damage at
Maidstone service station, which
P&O ferries confirmed. The
boat club denies that there were
any complaints made during the
planned stop in Maidstone.
The boat club was told by P&O
that they could take a slightly later
ferry, but as the coach driver was

getting close to his legal driving
limit time, this would be impossible.
The Dover port police were called,
to help the coach get out of the
one way system before the group
were driven back to Hammersmith.
Upon returning, the group tried to
book another coach in an attempt
to save the short weekend trip, but
could not.
Drinking was heavy on the trip,
with some rowers reportedly having
port bottles strapped to their arms,
that they weren’t allowed to remove
until the bottles were finished.
The trip,which cost £80 per ticket,
involved two coaches and 100
students, who each pay £70 per year
for club membership.
Some students had previously
arranged to fly or take the train to
Leuven instead. These members got
to their destination without a hitch.
This news comes after last year’s
shenanigans on the same club’s
annual Leuven trip, when a coach
window was smashed on the way
to Dover. Although the person
responsible was an alumni student,
the whole club was suspended
during Imperial College Union’s
investigation.
The ICSM President and boat
club declined to comment on this
year’s incident. The tweet printed
here suggests the club has not been
issued with a ban. A representative
of Imperial College Union told us
they “had been informed and are
investigating”.
