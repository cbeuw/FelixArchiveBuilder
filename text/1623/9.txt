Terrible Love, not so terrible EP

T
errible Love is a new
band featuring UK
Hardcore stalwarts from
well-regarded and sorely
missed bands such as Bastions,
Grappler, Goodtime Boys and
Crocus. On paper this EP should
be a solid slice of melodic Hardcore
with some post rock leanings and
cathartic lyrics and vocals.
The best tracks of this EP are
when Terrible Love insert real drive
into their songs. ‘Mt Misery’ is a
highlight with its driving guitar
and drum lines. The cathartic
opener ‘Change Nothing’showcases
muscular musicianship that would
easily translate to a live domain.
With its powerful gang vocals
chorus’, tense bridge and jangly
verse guitar lines, it shows off the
skills that made Grappler and
Bastions such necessary listening.
Unfortunately, the guitar tone
the lead guitarist uses during the
understandable, but I feel this takes
away from what should be the most
dramatic and emotional parts of the
songs, leaving them insincere. The
stodgy ‘They Need You’really suffers
from this poor choice with the peak
of this song sounding really corny,
whilst ‘The Stone in Me’ has some
really twangy sounding arpeggios
that almost sound comical.
The EP is good and shows
promise for the future of the band
especially in their more driving
triumphant style songs and when
they stay away from questionable
tone choices. Whilst I feel this
release fails to eclipse the member’s
previous works, with the spite and
despondency of Bastions and the
ferocity of Grappler missing in this
release, it’ll be interesting to see
where this band goes next.
