Retro Retrospective: Mad Men
L
ast year marked the end
of lots of things; Jon
Stewart’s run on the Daily
Show, Bill Cosby’s career,
Meek Mill’s career, 2014, and many
beloved TV shows. Of these, one
was Mad Men, a series I discovered,
binge watched, and fell in love with,
all in the space of about two weeks.
Centring on the enigmatic and
dapper Don Draper, played by a
perfectly cast Jon Hamm, the show
follows the exploits of the men and
women of the Sterling-Cooper
advertising agency; as they attempt
to navigate through the rapidly
changing world of 1960s New York.
The driving force of the series is
the strength of its characters. There
are no one-dimensional characters,
no real ‘villains’, and everyone gets
moment to shine. At first Draper
seems to the platonic ideal of the
60s Ad-man; suave, charming,
clever, a veritable James Bond-type.
However, the first episode expertly
and efficiently deconstructs this,
revealing all his flaws and failings.
No, Don Draper is not necessarily a
good man. However, he is trying his
damndest; which is what makes him
such a compelling lead. We root for
him to succeed and overcome, even
as we see him fall,right on the verge,
because of his own shortcomings.
This is, of course, not all the
piece is. In its scale, it very much
feels like a ‘Great American novel’;
a modern day ‘Great Gatsby’,
warning us of the pitfalls of avarice
and overindulgence. It destroys that
old adage ‘things were better in my
day’ (in this case the 60s), showing
us the past in all its grimy glory.
Such things are always deftly and
respectfully handled.
One of the central narratives
follows Peggy Olsen (Elisabeth
Moss), as she attempts to make it
through the male dominated and
in the 21st
century.
Don’t get the impression that
the show is all serious, however.
There are plenty of funny moments
spread throughout, and showrunner
Matthew Weiner goes to great
lengths to ensure viewers are never
bored or overwhelmed by drama.
There is an understanding that, as in
real life, both are required to keep
things believable. In fact, one of the
shows greatest comedic triumphs
comes with the episode ‘Guy walks
into an advertising agency’ (S3E6),
which in my book is perhaps one
of the greatest and meta titles an
episode of anything has ever had.
Without spoiling anything, I’ll say
that realising its significance will
make you smirk. The title coupled
with events towards the end serve
to turn the whole episode into one
long hilarious, if cruel joke. Then,
of course, there’s that wonderfully
surreal dance number in ‘Waterloo’
(S7E7).
The writing has a beautiful way
of endearing to you those who
only a second ago you hated. The
misogynistic advertising world.
There are also the subtle touches,
such as the rampant alcoholism
(though admittedly I’d love to
have that kind of bar in my office
one day) or firm partner Roger
Sterling’s (John Slattery) hatred of
the Japanese, due to his part in the
Second World War. These, while
barely commented on by characters
in the era,are blatantly obvious to us
Kiernan Shipka (playing Draper’s
young daughter), are some of the
best I’ve seen.
I’d be remiss in forgetting
to highlight the downright
poetic synergy of direction/
cinematography and writing.
Whether it’s the powerfully
metaphorical sequence at the end
of ‘Shoot’ (S1E9), or the incredible
continuous shot of Don Draper
walking set to ‘You only live twice’
(ironically signifying his fall back
into his old habits) in‘The Phantom’
(S5E13), every so often the show
throws these moments at you that
just scream ‘iconic’. The settings
used are often just as important
as the acting, with them reflecting
the characters or being symbolic of
this. An example of this is the use
of bright and over saturated colours
for California, in contrast with
the relatively industrial and faded
colours of New York; used in order
to signify the happiness and peace
Draper feels in the West rather than
at home. Interestingly, the colours
and materials also have a distinctly
flimsy and artificial feel to them,
reflecting the constructed and easily
breakable nature of this illusion.
Frankly, I can keep gushing about
it, but the exquisite quality of Mad
Men is something that simply must
be experienced. It succeeds because
all of its elements come together
wonderfully. If I can’t convince you,
perhaps the show’s 16 Emmys and
five Golden Globes will.
Mad Men is available on Netflix
and Sky
dialogue again is a testament to the
skill of the writers. It ranges from
charming, to witty, to pithy, often
all at once. Consistently believable,
what it never manages to be is dull
or stilted. This is all to say nothing
of the calibre of the cast.It’s obvious
everyone is acting their heart out,
and this really helps cement these
characters and make the viewers
thoroughly invested in them.

P
retty much any new TV
series has a period of
adjustment where the
actors settle into their
roles and the writers capture the
show’s voice. Superhero shows
are of course, no exception to this
rule, as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
can testify. What makes the Flash
unique is that it was able to hit
the ground running straight off
and just continually got better over
the course of the next few months.
Strictly speaking, it didn’t have to
start from scratch; being a spinoff of
Arrow, some of the characters and
ideas were already established prior
to its pilot.
A star feature of the show is
Grant Gustin’s performance as
Barry Allen, a forensic scientist and
the series’ titular hero. Gustin gives
us a Barry Allen who is immensely
likeable and impossible not to relate
with. A stark contrast from Stephen
Amell’s intense and broody Oliver
Queen, Gustin brings an enjoyable
combination of youthful energy,
delicate poignancy as well as a touch
of Peter Parker-esque awkwardness
to the table.
It isn’t just the main hero who
gives an amazing performance,
it is the entire supporting cast.
A lot of the show’s driving force,
drama and emotional core comes
from Barry’s relationships with his
circle of friends, families and allies.
All the possible relationships are
exploited to great effect. The two
main highlights are Jesse L. Martin
as Barry’s adoptive father and Tom
Cavanagh as his mentor. Martin
brings a nice touch of warmth to
his role, both as an anxious father
and a man perplexed by all the crazy
things around him. Cavanagh’s
Harrison Wells is the show’s most
captivating character, appearing to
care for Barry while also being more
than what meets the eye, eventually
becoming season one’s main
antagonist. There isn’t enough time
to go through all the characters but
than film. Weekly episodes can
do serialised storytelling in a way
a couple of films each year just
can’t. Of course a major advantage
of films is having more time and
money to bring the powers and
spectacles to life. For a TV drama
however, the effects of the Flash are
damn impressive. His super-speed
is rendered well in creative ways as
well as the abilities of the numerous
villains. A particular highlight
is Gorilla Grodd, a completely
computer-animated villain who
heavily featured in two episodes so
far.
The show is also never afraid to
embrace the more colourful, light-
hearted and ostentatious features of
comic books.The show is easily able
to juggle between time-travel and
telepathic gorillas while making
everything work in a universe
where powers are new and most
people don’t know how to react to
them. The show gets bolder with
this as it goes along, with season
two introducing the concept of
the multiverse with dopplegangers
from a parallel earth. The humour
plays a big part in keeping things
grounded and not letting the drama
get out of hand. With all the fun
and flashy elements of comics, the
show provides a welcome change of
pace from the dark and grounded
adaptations going around.
While the show follows a standard
‘villain-of-the-week’ format, it is
one done rather well.While some of
villains come off as underdeveloped
and one-dimensional, others
have more nuanced and stronger
appearances. Reverse-Flash and
Zoom, the main antagonists of
seasons one and two are done well
as complex and terrifying main
villains. Mark Hamill also shows up
as the Trickster, a role he had from
the 1990’s short-lived Flash series.
His debut episode also proved that
the show is capable of going into
full-on camp territory without
losing sight of its goal.
A major standout episode is the
season one finale “Fast Enough”.
It does away with the “final
confrontation”trend, moving that to
the penultimate episode. It was an
intensely emotional finale, forcing
Barry to decide just how much he’s
willing to sacrifice in order to save
his mother. Every actor was on full
form and it felt like a great payoff
to a season’s worth of buildup. It
also ended on a cliffhanger which,
while aggravating, left the window
opened for anything. This is nicely
fleshed out and explored in season
two.
The Flash is set to get his own
solo movie in 2018, but featuring
a completely new cast, story and
even Barry Allen in the form of
Ezra Miller. While it’s an unusual
and interesting decision, the movie
version definitely has a lot to
prove with the show setting the
bar so high. With great acting and
never being afraid to embrace its
comic book roots, the Flash has an
impressively high quality level and
serves as a strong blueprint of how
to do superheroes on TV.
The Flash is available on Amazon
Prime
rest assured, everyone has their own
quirks, traits and their time to shine.
Looking at all the underlying
conflicts and how they develop
overtime, it’s clear the Flash is
able to succeed because it adopts
the serialised nature of superhero
comics really well. With each
episode having its fair share of twists
and surprises as well as a climactic
cliffhanger, it serves as a reminder
that ultimately, TV is inherently
a better medium for superheroes
