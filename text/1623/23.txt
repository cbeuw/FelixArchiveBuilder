n the first match of the new
year on Wednesday 20th
January, the Imperial woman’s
rugby team set off to Reading
in a hope of their first win this
season in the league.
Spirits and morale were high as
the team arrived nearly on time to
the sports ground. After a quick
warm up, the game was underway.
After an early try by Reading, not
disheartened, the team pulled
together and managed to score two
tries in the first half.
The first by Charlotte, in a show
of pure strength and determination,
pushed through the opposing line
and the second was from Elizabeth
in an equally mighty battle to the
line.
Imperial got a very lucky break
when, having broken free of
opponents, a Reading player failed
to put down the ball on the touch
line and ran it into the dead zone!
But this was only a slight let up and
unfortunately the speed of Reading
was too much at times and they
broke through the Imperial team,
pushing them further into the lead.
All in all the first half showed
some very good rugby,with Imperial
winning scrums and turning over in
rucks.
At the half time team talk, spirits
were lifted and the team were eager
to pull back some points. However,
the hard pitch (nearly frozen) made
this an even harder task.The second
half was a story of tackling, with
some amazing tackles being landed
by everyone, especially Lizzie, Pip
and Freya.The rucking ability of the
Imperial team was far superior to
Reading’s, with a large proportion
of tackles ending up in a turnover.
Unfortunately, the second half
also led to some injuries, notably
the Captain’s cracked rib, meaning
that Reading’s speedy number
twelve managed to slip through the
defensive line, scoring more tries.
The Imperial team thought they
had a lucky break when, due to
injury, Reading’s top try scorer
(of this match), was subbed off.
However, the lack of recent training
was starting to show as the team
tired towards the end, and couldn’t
quite get any points back.
The final score was 65-10
to Reading. But it was not a
disheartening game, with many
of the girls playing a stormer of
a match, and having the bruises
to prove it, it was a very good
benchmark to start the season on.
Well done girls!
