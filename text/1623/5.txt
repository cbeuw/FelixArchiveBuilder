COMMENT
The royals should pay for themselves
If we cut spending on the royals,
the money could be better spent
elsewhere

F
or a long time, the UK
has been wading through
an era of cuts, cuts and
more cuts. The NHS is
expected to shave off £20bn in costs
by 2021, schools are preparing for
16% cuts over the next three years,
and controversial plans to reduce
working tax credits have been in
the public eye recently. Despite
there being some overly optimistic
murmurs of an end to austerity,
it’s looking unlikely that George
Osborne is going to start splashing
the cash any time soon. It’s a sticky
situation that, supposedly, we’re all
in together.
But guess who’s still balling?
That’s right, the old baked bean and
co.are seemingly unaffected by UK’s
financial state.
For at least two years, there will
be no cuts to the royal budget. In
fact the taxpayer funded income
for the royals will actually rise to as
much as £44 million (due to repairs
needed for the palaces), before the
royals will have to face reductions
to funding. This is on top of the
Queen’s private income from the
inherited estates, land owned, and
the crown estate.
Although this money doesn’t
hugely impact the taxpayer, with the
cost per person coming to just 56p
each – quite good value, considering
we reap the vast benefits of the royal
loving tourists – there is an issue. By
not scrutinising the royal budget,
and even allowing it to rise, they
are sending out the message that
the royals will never have to make
the same sacrifices as the rest of the
population. While we’re all feeling
the effects, old Lizzy and Phil carry
on livin’ it large.
And it’s not just the main
figureheads that are smooth sailing
through austerity. The swarm of

The royals
will never
have to
make
the same
sacrifices
as the
rest of the
population
The old
baked bean
and co. are
seemingly
unaffected
by the UK’s
financial
state
affect the amount of public funding
needed.If they were to be axed from
the royal payroll, the extra pennies
needed for repairs could be covered
by the private income, and there
would be no need for taxpayer’s
money which could be much better
spent elsewhere.
With the potential £8 million rise
to the royal budget, the government
could have paid for roughly 1000
heart bypass surgeries or 10,000
cataracts operations; built a new
average sized school; or even paid
off 889 students’ tuition fees for a
year! Instead, that money will be
spent on tarting up Buckingham
Palace’s interior and reupholstering
the corgis’ baskets.
The whole notion of this is not
only uninspiring for the public, it
undermines the government’s harsh
and increasingly unpopular tactics
for getting the country back in
shape.The issue is enhanced because
now there really isn’t any reason why
taxpayer’s money should continue
funding the royals’ ever expanding
budget. The royal family has next
to no power anymore. No one is
going to be thrown in the stocks for
opposing the rise to their budget,
and therefore it seems ridiculous
that we should have to keep paying
out.
Ultimately it’s time for the royal
family to start budgeting and getting
by on their own. Switch the fine
wines for Sainsbury’s Basics, make
the horse and carriages available
for hen dos, rent out Balmoral as
a haunted house, or maybe just get
Charles flogging shedloads more
Duchy Originals. It doesn’t matter
how it’s done, just as long as it puts
an end to the royal freeloading.
