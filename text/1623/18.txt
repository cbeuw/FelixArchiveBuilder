FILM
T
he Revenant is a brutal
film. Nominated for
twelve Oscars, it’s
looking like this might
be the one that bags it for Leo,
and goddamn, will he have earned
it. Anyone who has read anything
about director Alejandro González
Iñárritu’s new frontier survival epic
will know that everything about
the film’s production was a feat of
superhuman effort and endurance.
From freezing temperatures to
miniscule daylight hours, the fact
that this film exists at all is testament
to the will of the cast and crew to
make something worthy of the story
that inspired it. I’m happy to report
that this effort was not in vain.
Set in the wilderness of
1823 Montana and based on
the events surrounding Hugh
Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) – a
legendary frontiersman and fur
trapper – The Revenant is a study
in grim determination. It begins
with Glass’s fur trapping party
being ambushed by native Arikara
warriors, which leaves most of the
men dead. The survivors, including
cantankerous half-scalped trapper
Thomas Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy),
decide to head overland to the
nearest settlement. Shortly
afterwards,Glass surprises a mother
bear with her cubs, and is viciously
mauled. Severely injured, Glass is
left to either recover or die with
his half Native-American son
Hawk, Fitzgerald, and naïve young
trapper Jim Bridger (Will Poulter).
Fitzgerald kills Hawk, and tricks
Bridger into abandoning Glass,
leaving him alone and weaponless in
the wilderness with hostile natives
pursuing.What follows is one of the
greatest survival tales of all time and
a 200-mile odyssey to seek revenge
on the man who killed his son and
left him for dead.
Fromtheoff,youknowwhatyou’re
in for. The ambush occurs within
the first fifteen minutes and by
then about twenty people have died
onscreen, many of them extremely
graphically: arrows through throats;
shots through chests; axes through
skulls.No,this film doesn’t spare you
the gory reality of frontier living at
all. However, while the vast amount
of violence will be in itself a turnoff
for some, it is beautifully done. The
shocking immediacy of the deaths
is acutely felt, as opposed to grunts
dropping like flies, Rambo-style, in
a cartoony Wilhelm-scream-esque
death.
The famous bear-attack is another
pointofartfulviolenceandsomehow
tops the previous ballet of suffering.
In my opinion DiCaprio deserves
an Oscar simply for the toe-curling,
butt-clenching screams of pain
and waves of facial contortion he
produces during the scene. Serious
credit must also go to whoever
produced the bear (one of the only
concessions to CGI in the whole
film) which I’m sure will stand the
test of time as an example of CGI
done right. One particular moment
that highlights the director’s
commitment to convincing us of
his film’s reality is when the bear’s
heaving breath fogs up the lens of
the camera, making you feel like
DiCaprio is really being savaged by
a true tank of an animal.
As you will probably have noticed,
suffering is quite the theme running
through this film from start to
finish. While this is masterfully
done, viewers looking for a film
with more emotional heft may want
to look elsewhere, as there’s not
really much emotion on show other
than vengeance, fear, and varying
levels of pain and survival instinct.
What drives the film and keeps you
engaged for the whole (admittedly
rather long) 156-minute runtime is
seeing what Glass will survive next.
Such adversities include sub-zero
temperatures, starvation, gangrene,
and frozen rivers, with your overall
opinion of the movie mostly being

the gory
reality of
frontier life
Endurance is everything in The Revenant
If Iñárritu’s frontier survival epic doesn’t net Leo that Oscar, nothing will
shaped by whether you’re invested
enough to see him pull through
another punishing situation.
DiCaprio isn’t the only hook
in this film though, with Tom
Hardy and Will Poulter putting in
convincing performances in their
own right. The cinematography
of Emmanuel Lubezki is another
draw, with beautifully constructed
shots and long ‘how-did-they-do-
that’ single take sequences showing
off serious filmmaking prowess.
The entire film is aided in its
authenticity and onscreen intensity
by the fact that it was simply so
bloody hard to make. Treacherous
weather conditions and sub-zero
temperatures meant that actors were
constantly fighting off hypothermia,
and Iñárritu’s insistence on using
only natural lighting for shots
limited filming time to a few hours
a day. Every scene was meticulously
rehearsed, and the effort shows in
the final product.
The Revenant is a visceral venture
into a cold hell of life and death,and
– in the age of blockbuster sequels
– one of the most original films to
have come out in a long while. A
gamble that seems to have paid off,I
can only hope the film and its actors
get the recognition they deserve.
R
oom is a story of
kidnapping, survival and,
ultimately, hope. The two
lead performances by Brie
Larson and Jacob Tremblay give the
film heartbreaking depth, but this is
hindered by a wobbly narrative.
The film follows a mother known
only as Ma, played by Larson, and
her five-year-old son, Jack, played
by Tremblay, as they live their life
as captives in a shed. At the start,
Ma has been held captive for seven
years, meaning Jack has lived his
entire life in what they call ‘Room’.
To make it bearable, Ma has told
Jack that Room is the entire world,
that beyond it is only space, and
beyond that is ‘TV world’. What
follows is their attempt at escape –
but even if they manage it, can they
handle living in the world beyond
Room?
Considering the large amount of
time spent in such a small room,
not once did the film feel closed
in. Director Lenny Abrahamson
somehow created the feeling of
a wide expanse that beautifully
mirrors the incredible world that
Ma had created for Jack. But is this
world really beneficial for him in
the long run? By telling him this
story, will it make it harder to come
to terms with the real world upon
their escape? The film delves into
questions like this one, sometimes
answering them, other times

O
nce in a while, the
pairing of an actor
and a role appears so
perfect that it eclipses
the possibility of that actor ever
truly being separated from their
character: Hugh Jackman will
always be Wolverine despite his
continually-expanding performance
résumé, and Robert Downey Jr.
quite simply is Tony Stark. One of
the earliest and best examples of
such a pairing is Sylvester Stallone
and his humble-beginnings boxing
champ Rocky Balboa, a character so
iconic and well-loved that it’s quite
hard to remember exactly when you
first heard about the Rocky saga,
although you’re certain it was quite
some time ago.
Stallone’s Rocky now returns to
the silver screen for a seventh time
in Creed, although not quite taking
centre stage – the story instead
is based on Adonis (Michael B.
Jordan), the son of Rocky’s old
rival and friend Apollo Creed, who
rejects the easy life anointed by his
father’s financial success and instead
hungers to become a boxer himself.
In search of proper guidance,
Adonis tracks down Balboa in the
dusky backstreets of Philadelphia –
the same setting of all the previous
Rocky movies – and asks for his
training.It may not sound massively
original, but this is a sports drama –
what would you expect?
Except it’s not just a sports drama.
In the vein of the best of the Rocky
films,Creed uses its visceral sporting
action as a thrilling backdrop to a
human drama that is perhaps even
more engaging than its counterpart.
While the poignancy of Adonis’
fightforsuccessissomewhatblunted
by the silver-spoon upbringing he
received, it is made up for by the
film’s powerful exploration of the
themes of family, passion – the real
battle is not for a mere title, but for
Adonis’ very identity.
The performances, as is common
in sports drama, bolster the film
with their authenticity – Michael
B. Jordan has worked with director
Ryan Coogler previously on the
acclaimed Fruitvale Station, and
it’s clear that the professional
relationship between them is a
strong one; while the films don’t
overlap much thematically, the
palpable power that possessed
Jordan’s portrayal of Oscar Grant
in Fruitvale Station courses through
the blood in Adonis Creed’s veins.
While Jordan remains an arresting
and immediate central presence
throughout, and a likeable new
hero to carry the saga forward for
a new generation, it is in fact the
old guard Stallone who steals the
show – that legendarily winning
combination of actor and role rings
true once again. As an audience we
fully believe that although age is
catching up with Rocky – a moving
scene in which he visits the graves
of some old friends is a highlight
– he is still undeniably Rocky:
quietly passionate, a little goofy,
and ultimately heart-wrenchingly
lovable. His performance is truly
excellent; I’ll sleep well if Stallone
carries home this year’s Best
Supporting Actor Oscar (as it’s
largely suspected he will).
It’s not often that a truly
worthwhile reboot comes along, but
this may well be the most engaging
one in years. Creed makes up for its
lack of originality with a good story,
told well by a talented cast – with
some brilliantly-done fight scenes
to boot.
TOM STEPHENS
Creed may
well be
the most
engaging,
worthwhile
reboot to
come along
in years
intentionally refusing to.
At only eight years old, Tremblay
gives a performance anyone would
be proud to call their greatest work.
It’s a real shame that he was mostly
ignored for award nominations;
it must be difficult for anyone to
play someone whose entire world is
completely changed so convincingly,
let alone a child. Watch out for this
kid, he could likely grow up to be
one of his generation’s finest actors.
Larson succeeds in creating
a character who is terrified and
broken underneath whilst trying
to appear strong and happy for
her son, going from motherly to
angry to desperate in the blink of
an eye – an emotionally exhausting
performance.
Although Room has many great
aspects to it, it isn’t perfect: the
first half of the film is intense and
emotional, and at one point I could
even feel my heart thudding heavily;
but all too quickly, the narrative of
the film turns into a semi-incoherent
mess. While all the individual
scenes in the second half are well
made, they don’t always fit together
naturally. At one point, a character
is introduced, and a plot develops
around them, but before anything
can happen the character disappears
forever, without seeming to really
affect anyone.This, along with other
parts, means that the empathy I
felt for Ma, built up so well in the
first half, began to slip away as the
film progresses – definitely not the
intended effect.
Room is a difficult film to watch;
it’s a dark and tragic story, but the
hope that remains throughout is
enough to make it watchable until
the end.
