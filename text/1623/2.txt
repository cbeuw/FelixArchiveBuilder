I
love the medics, in all of their
forms. I like the artsy medics,
the Muslim medics, the medic
sabbs, the medics who try and
sell me doughnuts in SAF, and even
the sporty ones.
Look, if we were all stuck on a
desert island, the boat club medics
would survive a lot longer than
me. While I’d be writing out my
tweets in the sand and trying to
find a football to draw a face on for
company, they could perform first
aid, fashion slings from palm leaves
and most likely build a basic boat
and row to the nearest habitated
land mass, all in a time that BUCS
would be proud of.I have the utmost
respect for people that I know could
outlive me on a desert island.
They got hammered on a coach,
man. It happens. People get
hammered on coaches all the time,
and worse. Have you ever been on

the first Oxford Tube on a Sunday
morning? They were allowed to
drink on the coach. P&O wouldn’t
let them on the ferry. The coach
wouldn’t let them wait for the next
one. It was unfortunate. I hope they
get their dosh back.
But it did happen so I’m going
to report on it. If I see a suspicious
looking tweet, I’m going to start
making phonecalls. It doesn’t mean
I don’t like boat club, or P&O, or
port, or Belgium or medics because
I enjoy all of the above. One of my
best friends is a medic! I went to
Leuven! I went on a boat once! This
gal’s got no agenda, except to create
high quality content for millenials.
What is FELIX for? Well, it’s a
job for one thing, which brushes
the tumbleweed from my CV and
allows me to enjoy the finer things
in life, like food and accomodation.
But news happens, and the paper
will report on it. That’s life, chums!
If this all sounds quite exciting you
should probably write for us. And if
you hate us now, we’ll let you write
for us too. It’s nice to have a bit of
variation.

In response to ‘Imperial
professor makes questionable
comments on race in new book’,
Issue 1622
There have been many reports in
the newspapers of ‘no-go’ areas in
large cities in England.
There is absolutely no need to give
citations for my opinions in this
book.I give a list of factors (page 18)
which could help minimise internal
and external conflicts, including
clear natural boundaries, one race,
one culture, one language, one
religion. I am not advocating those
things.Given the enormous amount
of conflict caused within and
between countries by differences in
race, culture and religion, I do not
see how any sensible person could
object to that theoretical list.
As for the comments by ‘Stan’
about my teaching methods, I
have to say that my methods were
very successful, with the course on
which I was the sole teacher usually
getting the highest or second
highest average mark of any course
in the department, with approval
of the second marker and external
examiners. It is complete rubbish
that I wrote out all my lecture
notes on the board - an impossible
task in the time. I did write major
terms on the board and pit [sic] up
diagrams on the board. This helped
the students to take good lecture
notes. Some staff members flashed
many PowerPoint slides on and
off, not letting students take down
details in the lecture, condemning
them to spend ages looking them
up electronically later if they
wanted the details. More than once
the students gave me 100% highly
satisfied ratings in the end of course
official student questionnaires, so
not all were of Stan’s opinion. Stan
is certainly right that I cared about
my students and topic. I am still in
contact with many former students
even from many years ago. I had
many delightful students and really
enjoyed teaching them, whatever
their ability level.
Should FELIX wish too [sic]
publish my reply, I am happy for
them to do so, providing they give
me a copy.
