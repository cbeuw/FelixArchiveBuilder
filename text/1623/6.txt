reens everywhere,
rejoice! It’s looking
like those Heathrow-
hating prayers have
been answered by none other than
NASA’s own home-grown team of
Aero Engineers and associates.
On the 4th
of the January
2016, NASA released a press
statement with big claims: their
Environmentally Responsible
Aviation project (ERA) had been a
heart-warming success, set to save
the airline industry over $255 billion
dollars over 25 years (2025 – 2050)
and cut huge amounts of pollution,
all by playing the efficiency game.
The project began in 2009,
scheduled for completion by the
end of 2015, totalling a runtime of
six years in development. A host of
industry partners jumped on board
– some of which include General
Electric, Pratt & Whitney, the
US Air Force, Boeing and smaller
contractors – as they volunteered
over $250 million and their own
facilities to undertake the work.
NASA fronted the remaining $400
million of the expenditure.
allowed the plane wing to seamlessly
extend its flaps.
A redesign of the combustion
stage via Pratt & Witney decreased
nitrogen oxide pollution from
combustion by up to 80%; and
finally, the Hybrid Wing-Body
Concept (HWB) was successfully
tested, whereby the whole body
seamlessly forms into wings, with
the engines mounted on top.
So, there you have it, there is
such a thing as fairy-tale endings
to research projects; say hello to
quiet skies, clean clouds and happy
Greenpeace protesters, for now.

NASA’s billion-dollar savings plan
Because green is so much more than just the colour of money
giants were keen to get involved.
Ed Waggoner, Director of NASA’s
Integrated Systems Research
Program explained “It has been an
unmitigated success... every one
of our industry partners is getting
something out of it.”
And he’s right, the outcome of
the project was a whopping 75%
pollution saving, a halving of fuel
consumption and a reduction in
noise pollution to an eighth of
current levels.
The project was aimed at
thoroughly testing eight technology
concepts and refining the ideas.
The findings were interesting; some
examples are highlighted for your
geeky pleasure.
Firstly, they include an innovation
of “tiny embedded nozzles” blowing
air over the vertical tail fin of an
aircraft meaning smaller tail fins can
be used. In addition to this, a new
non-stick coating design helping
to prevent residue build up was
tested. Secondly, cleverly stitched
composite materials cut weight by
20% making for safer and lighter
aircraft bodies. Thirdly, testing of
the “morphing wing concept” via
the US Air Force and FlexySys Inc.
Calling all science writers
For those who know the
commercial aerospace industry, one
wading deep in safety regulations,
conservative design and high stakes
engineering (and rightly so), it
was a welcome opportunity for
scientists and engineers to really
have a crack at some unusual ideas.
It was no wonder some industry
