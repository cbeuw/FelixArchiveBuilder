The top three
method actors
that aren’t
Daniel Day-
Lewis
W
ith anecdotes far
too extensive to
cover in any one
article, Daniel
Day-Lewis treads the line between
genius and madman. His dedication
to method-acting led him to,
for example, remain exclusively
wheelchair-bound and spoon-fed
throughout filming of My Left
Foot. However, with actors being
the weird bunch they are, there are
plenty of other examples to look to:
Choi Min-Sik
One story that has come out of
Leonardo DiCaprio’s role in The
Revenant involves his eating of raw
liver despite being a vegetarian.
In a similar vein, the Buddhist
actor Choi Min-sik ate several
live octopuses for his role in the
superb Oldboy, praying for each one
beforehand. In the film, each year of
protagonist Dae-su’s confinement
was marked by hot wire as a tally on
the skin. This marking, along with
the weight fluctuations that came
with confinement, was not faked.
Hilary Swank
The 1999 film Boys Don’t Cry
portrays the life of Brandon Teena,
a transgender man murdered in
1993. Hilary Swank was cast and,
for over a month before shooting,
lived her life as a man. Introducing
herself as her brother to friends
and neighbours Swank covered her
breasts, stuffed her underwear, cut
her hair short and spoke in a low
tone in her dedication to the act.
Christian Bale
Christian Bale is well-known for
his extreme weight fluctuations.The
most famous example was in the
mid-2000s, when he nearly halved
his weight by eating one apple and
tin of tuna a day to play skeletal
Trevor Reznik in The Machinist
before gaining back 109lbs of
muscle for the first of the Dark
Knight Trilogy. In the past few days
Bale abandoned his role as Enzo
Ferrari for health concerns. Good to
see he has limits, I suppose.

Winners and losers in this year’s
Oscar nominations
L
ast week saw the
announcement of the
nominations for the 88th
Academy Awards, quite
possibly the event of the cinematic
calendar. In a perfunctory ceremony,
headed by Ang Lee and Guillermo
del Toro, the names were rattled off
in quick succession, leaving plenty
of time for the following deluge of
critical analysis of the list. So how
is the ceremony shaping up for this
year?
Alejandro G. Iñárratu’s frontier
revenge-epic The Revenant leads
the pack, with twelve nominations,
including Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Actor, and Best
Supporting Actor. If the Golden
Globes and Critics’ Choice Awards
are anything to go by, this year
will see the Best Actor award go
to Leonardo DiCaprio, whose
nomination for The Revenant is his
fifth for acting. However, a large
number of nominations does not
necessarily transform into actual
success; one only needs to look back
to two years ago, when David O.
Russell’s American Hustle, which led
the pack with ten nominations,went
home empty-handed. One thing we
can near-guarantee, however, is that
someone will flub Iñárratu’s name
– here’s hoping for a repeat of John
Travolta’s infamous ‘Adele Dazeem’
incident.
Tailing just behind The Revenant
suggestion that no black artists are
good enough to be nominated that
is more upsetting. Idris Elba, whose
terrifying turn as a commander
leading a group of child soldiers
in Beasts of No Nation earned him
nominations for a BAFTA, Golden
Globe, and a Screen Actors Guild
Award,was snubbed by the academy.
Similarly, Will Smith’s turn in
sports drama Concussion, which saw
a Golden Globe nomination, was
ignored.
The latest in the Rocky saga,
Creed, saw Sylvester Stallone earn
a nomination for Best Supporting
Actor, but no nomination for its
black director Ryan Coogler, nor
its black lead Michael B. Jordan.
Similarly, Straight Outta Compton,
the N.W.A. biopic that became the
highest grossing film with a black
director, only received a nomination
for its four screenwriters, all of
whom are white.
With many seeing this as an
indication of racial bias on the
part of the Academy, high profile
names like Spike Lee and Jada
Pinkett Smith both announcing
their intention to boycott the
ceremony. It comes as a bit of
an embarrassment to Academy
president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the
first African-American to be elected
to the position, who has been vocal
in her criticism of the Academy’s
lack of diversity. Despite removing
the membership cap, and recruiting
400 younger members, as the last
couple of years have shown, things
are not improving. In a statement
on Twitter last week, she said that
she was ‘heartbroken and frustrated
about the lack of inclusion’, and
acknowledged that ‘change is not
coming as fast as we would like’.She
has announced that she will launch
an investigation into the Academy,
with the likely outcome of changing
the membership structure to better
represent the film-going public.
And this change is long-overdue.
A study in the L.A. Times from
last year found that the Academy
membership is 77% male, and 92%
Caucasian, with black members
making up only 2% of the Academy.
Furthermore, the average age of
members is 62, with people younger
than 50 making up only 14% of the
membership. With such a growing
divide between the Academy
membership and the movie-
going public, a rearrangement of
membership is much-needed.
But the problems with diversity
don’t just stop there: Todd Hayne’s
ravishing masterpiece Carol, which
garnered rave reviews across the
board, was noted by its lack of
inclusion in the Best Picture and
Best Director nominees. Many
saw this as a direct snub; the fact
that Carol was nominated for
Academy Awards for its acting,
is George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury
Road, which has ten nominations.
While the Academy has never been
known to shy away from populist
cinema, their recommendations
tend towards the bland (The King’s
Speech, anybody?) therefore, it is
refreshing to see them nominate
a film that has been undoubtedly
both wildly popular, and completely
off-the-wall. The fact that its
nominations include both Best
Picture and Best Director are
perhaps signs that the Academy is
beginning to embrace maximalist
cinema, as demonstrated by Miller’s
bonkers blockbuster. Ridley Scott’s
The Martian, essentially a vessel
for Matt Damon’s acting chops,
garnered seven nominations, and
recent success at other ceremonies
means it could be one to watch on
the night.
However, a large number
of cinema-goers were left
disappointed, after this ceremony
acted as a sequel to last year’s
#OscarsSoWhite debacle, where
Ava DuVernay’s Selma was by-and-
large shut out of nominations. Like
last year, all twenty nominees for
acting awards are white, prompting
many commentators to question the
process behind the awards, calling
for a greater diversity in the makeup
of the Academy. While many of the
performances nominated this year
have been worthy of awards, it is the
Documentary corner: Nas:Time is Illmatic
Ben Collier
Writer
I
n 1994, Nasir “Nas” Jones
released his debut studio
album Illmatic. The record
quickly became a classic of
hip-hop music, and one of the most
influential albums of all time. Many
people consider this album, myself
included, to be one of the best, hip-
hop or otherwise, ever produced.
NME magazine at the time
described it as ‘rhythmic perfection,’
and in retrospect many discuss it
alongside 36 chambers, Ready to Die,
The Chronic, and My Beautiful Dark
Twisted Fantasy.Nas:Time is Illmatic
provides a context for the album,
expanding on the topics covered
in its lyrics (from drug culture to
poverty) and narrating the early
life of Nas. One may expect this
documentary to exclusively feature
boasting and the kind of raving I
have just shamelessly demonstrated,
leading to a bland puff piece, but
this is far from the truth. In reality
we are treated to an intimate look
into Nas’ life and influences. We
see Nas grow up in the projects
of Queensbridge as the son of
a Jazz singer and postal worker,
experiencing the uglier sides of life
all in a film lovingly, professionally,
and subtly assembled.
Two key moments in the film
include the leaving of Nas’ father
and the death of his best friend
Willie Graham, who was shot
following a fight. This second
example was an incident that also
scarred Nas’ brother Jabari both
physically and emotionally. It is
interesting to occasionally look
beyond the bravado of Jabari in
particular and see a man who is
deeply scarred, even repeatedly
begging his mother to move as the
location of the shooting haunted
him. This culminates to show how
close Nas came to succumbing to
the life that many of his friends
did. A particularly poignant part
of the film features Jabari looking
at a picture included in the album’s
art of a group of Nas’ peers and
neighbours. Jabari explains how
each person featured is either in
jail, between sentences, or dead.The
true bleakness of the future faced
by many black youths at the time
strikes hard here, and is emphasised
by Princeton professor Dr. Cornel
West, who elaborates on the life
of the average working class black
family in the US at that time.
Thefinalsectionsofthefilmclosely
follows the rise of Nas as a teenager
making music and the development
of his famed lyricism. One criticism
here is that the very short running
time doesn’t allow for exploration to
quite the level I would have liked in
some cases. However, what the film
does do right is portray the genre of
hip-hop as one that is essential to
communities such as Queensbridge,
and provide a refreshingly mature
view of the artistry,social awareness,
and poetic lyricism that rap music
can achieve.

cinematography, script, costume,
and score should have near-
guaranteed its inclusion in the
Best Picture category. Something
seems wrong, and my personal
hunch is that the Academy still
has a deep problem with films
that aren’t catering to a straight
audience. Carol is a film about two
lesbians that doesn’t veer off into
tragic territory, and offers a chance
of a happy ending; it was adapted
by a lesbian, from a book written
by a lesbian, and directed by a gay
man. It seems the Academy hasn’t
moved on much from 2004, when
the mediocre Crash won out over
the far superior Brokeback Mountain
(a decision even Crash’s director
has questioned). The decision this
year to include the straight-friendly
trans narrative of The Danish Girl
over the wildly liberating Tangerine
just reinforces this idea that the
Academy are hostile to LGBTQ
cinema.
Another snub was Sarah Gavron’s
obvious Oscar-bait Suffragette. I
finished my review of it (back in
October) with the line ‘it will win a
lot of Oscars,’and I now happily eat
my words.
However, it’s not all doom and
gloom with the nominations. One
of the most surprising outcomes in
this year’s awards was the growing
recognition outlets like Netflix are
getting for shaping the cinematic
market. While their original
production Beasts of No Nation
failed to gain any nominations, two
of the Best Documentary nominees,
What Happened, Ms. Simone? and
Winter on Fire, were distributed on
the online streaming programme.
While this perhaps only reflects
the openness of the documentary
branch of the Academy, it seems
inevitable that online streaming
services will go on to change the
future of cinema, just as they
revolutionised television culture.
Perhaps the final word should go
to the most pleasantly surprising
nomination: veteran British actor
Charlotte Rampling, who has
been nominated for her chillingly
powerful role in Andrew Haigh’s
long-awaited, critically-acclaimed
drama 45 Years, which focuses
on a married couple who have to
endure a shock to their relationship.
Rampling’s performance is simply
stunning in it, and – after the
Academy’s long-running tradition
of refusing to recognise art-house
talent – I am relieved that she is
recognised for her work. She has
already won awards for Best Actress
at the Berlin Film Festival, and the
European Film Awards; after the
performance was snubbed by the
BAFTAs, who nominated 45 Years
for only a single award, it’s good to
know that the world hasn’t gone
complete mad.
