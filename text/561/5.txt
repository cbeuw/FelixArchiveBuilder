'Torrance confronts the barman.
F i l m s
THE
SHiMiHQ
W H E N Jack Torrance is offered the job
of caretaker at an isolated hotel which will
be left empty through the harsh C o l o r a d o
w i n t e r , he d o e s n o t realise that m a n y
dangers await him there.
Thus the scene is set for the return to
the screen of two great artists, director
S t a n l e y K u b r i c k a n d the brilliant J a c k
Nicholson, w h o stars as Torrance.
The O v e r l o o k H o t e l is a vast building
perched high in the C o l o r a d o mountains
which is only inhabited by a caretaker and
his family during the winter months. Some
years previous to Torrance's arrival a horrific
murder was committed there by a caretaker
called Grady, who brutally slaughtered his
wife and daughters with an axe. Torrance
smiles broadly when informed of this — no
need to worry about anything like that with
him, he says.
Jack is accompanied by his wife Wendy
(Shelley Duvall) a n d son D a n n y , who is
apparently p o s s e s s e d of a power d u b b e d
'shining' (hence the title), which is some form
of psychic ability allowing him to briefly
glimpse the future and past. He forsees evil
at O v e r l o o k a n d o n a r r i v a l s t a r t s to
encounter various, spirits from the hotel's
sordid past.
Nicholson gives an excellent performance
in the leading role. Torrance is affected by
the isolation and strange forces present at
the hotel. Indeed, the most impressive parts
of the film are not so much the scenery or
e f f e c t s , but the g r a d u a l c o n t o r t i o n of
Nicholson's features as he is transformed
from a loving husband to murderer. His eyes
seem to harbour a deep-seeded malevolence
and the intensity of his insanity becomes
more and more apparent from his evil grin.
He begins to encounter the embodiments of
the spirits present; he drinks with a ghostly
barman and confronts a beautiful girl who
becomes transformed in his arms (into . . .
Arrrgh!). Eventually he picks up his axe and
starts to p u r s u e his f a m i l y t h r o u g h the
deserted hotel.
Stanley K u b r i c k , too, has done some
excellent work. His blend of music is in itself
very impressive and some of the photography
is breathtaking. Despite all this, however,
something seems to fall a little short. I found
that the whole story would probably have
been extremely boring and straightforward if
not for Nicholson's brilliant performance —
he seemed to hold the whole thing together.
The blame for this must lie at K u b r i c k ' s
door, who wrote the screenplay with Diane
Johnson from a novel by Stephen King. I
think that we could have been treated to
many more ingenious twists in the plot.
N e v e r t h e l e s s , as it s t a n d s the film is
beautiful, horrific at times and certainly the
best horror feature of recent years. Unfor-
tunately it is not a classic of the genre as
some writers seem to suggest. Perhaps they
are referring to Nicholson's classic perfor-
The Special Edition of
Close Encounters of the Third Kind
This film is well worth a second viewing, if
only to reinforce its position as a classic of
the genre. The re-editing and re-shooting of
some scenes has much enhanced the whole.
Some inclusions are obvious, the discovery
of a ship in the G o b i Dessert for one.
However, the much less obvious changes in
the home life of the character played by
Richard Dreyfuss are the key. In the original
the post-Watergate difficulty in coming to
terms with authority caused these scenes to
lack a certain credibility. Instead Dreyfuss is
seen as a man who has retained a sense of
wondering innocence (his championing of
the film Pinnochio) and finds himself looking
for more in life — open to suggestion from
above, when he sees the U F O s , which he
unquestionably accepts as real. His family
with whom he is unable to communicate
suggest the 'Grown Ups' in Peter Pan in
their mentality. But he rises above self-doubt
through a. period of suffering, his family
becoming superfluous after he finds that his
mountain exists.
The other visible change is the inclusion
of D r e y f u s s a s c e n d i n g i n t o the a l i e n
starship, here Spielberg uses the song Wish
Upon A Star to reflect almost a magical
atmosphere. It can be argued that this, is
best left to one's imagination; it is certainly
imagination that makes the initial scene of
the toys becoming alive so horrifying. The
final message of some greater power first
scrutinising and then redeeming Earth, has a
ready following, as Chariot of the Gods has
shown. Indeed the basic idea of the plot: of
a man being chosen; the why-me feeling of
inadequacy; the final movement to some
s p i r i t u a l s e r e n i t y c o u l d easily b e c o m e
ridiculous on the screen, except that hope is
in demand when the spectre of war and
uncertainty rises. Thus one is left with a film
that o w e s as m u c h to W a l t D i s n e y ' s
animated classics of the '30s and '40s as it
d o e s to the p r e c o c i o u s t a l e n t s of its
d i r e c t o r , S t e p h e n S p i e l b e r g . Its s t a r s
probably ought to reflect that, along with
those banes of the acting world: animals and
children, they ought not to act with spaceships.

I must congratulate E N T S on producing a
great freshers' gig.
The support, Time Flies, started slowly but
grew on me. Quite enjoyable, but still pretty
average.
A large audience were blinded as Classix
Nouveaux turned the white lights on them
for their intro. The lights faded and they
began their set. I had never seen Classix
before and I was impressed; especially by Sal
Solo, the vocalist. He had an amazing voice
range put to good use with his 'controlled'
vibratto scream, much to the enjoyment of
the audience. They finished with The Robots
Dance ( t h e i r s i n g l e ) . S a l S o l o g a v e a
magnificent performance clad in a tight white
suit — accompanied by strobe effects, the
true robot image came over very well.
Not surprisingly, an encore was demanded.
