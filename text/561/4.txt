Suggestions
Well no doubt you have all sampled Mr
Mooney's cooking and think that it is
absolutely wonderful, couldn't be better and
will really enjoy eating it all year. Mr Mooney
and the Union are so concerned that the
standard should be maintained and perhaps
even improved that 'Suggestions and
Complaints' boxes are installed in each
refectory so that you can air your views.
There should be a pad of paper and even a
pencil at each box to aid you. The boxes are
easily recognised by the large orange dayglo
signs above them saying 'Suggestions'. For
each letter you write you will received an
answer direct from student members of the
Suggestions and Complaints Committee.
Third World Scholarship
Contrary to the Editor's remark on gener-
osity in Freshers' FELIX, most people have
managed to donate £1 and for this we are
truly thankful. At time of writing (Tuesday
morning) the fund has topped £500; so
thanks ever so much and keep it rolling in.
Security
As you may have found out, the security
guards are having an overtime ban to get a
pay increase. All I can say is bear with it and
make sure to lock doors to Halls of
Residence when you come and go.
Ruth's Jacket
Someone very kindly removed the Guilds'
Jacket which.Ruth was wearing on Monday.
Now, I'm very sure that whoever took it
regards it as a wonderful trophy, something
they are really pleased to have, but I would
not like to be them if he, she or it is found
by several people.
Overseas Students and Visas
Could all overseas students please remember
to renew visas O N E M O N T H before they
expire. There should be something about it
in your passport but this is not always the
case. If in doubt, please contact me in the
Union Office.
Bye-Bye
I hope you have all settled in and are happy.
There is no truth in the rumour that I was
seen romping in Prince's Gardens wearing
kinky underwear — it was Rachel. I am
managing to get out and see you all. Please talk
to me and remember it is easier for you
to remember our few names than us to
remember all yours. I shall be seeing you,
then. John Passmore

Matters Raised
Amusement Machines
These have now been installed in
the Lower Lounge and apart from
a few teething troubles (and
idiots nicking the cue-ball from
the pool table) seem to be going
okay. However to keep them in
good condition any defects must
be reported immediately, so we
can get them fixed. If you do lose
any money in them, you can
claim it back from Jen in the
Union Office.
Shedding Light on a Difficult
Process
Namely, the Maintenance Service
which works thus: I send in a
defect report to the main office,
this is sent to the relevant
section (e.g. electricians, carpen-
ters) and it then (eventually)
gets done. With regard to the
lights in the Union Gents loos, I
sent in a defect report on 19
August, followed by another
stressing the urgency of the
matter, on 25th September. That
morning I also talked to the
electrician who promised he'd do
it that afternoon. I talked to them
again this morning and they said
they'd come over after tea, so, I
hope they're fixed by the time
you're reading this'.
Moral: if there's a defect,
report it immediately, and then
please, try and be patient.
And Finally
This doesn't seem much to
report after a busy week, but I'm
sure I'll have much more to say
next week.
