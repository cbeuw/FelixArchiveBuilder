essential to elect a replacement as
soon as possible. The election will take

Committee (see notices for details), if
you are interested in rag and would like

Hodgson (Rag Chairman) in the ICU
or Rag Office lunchtimes.

•Bored? Finding it difficult to raise
the energy to fill out your own

queue, then try an injection of run.
IT WILL C H A N G E YOUR WHOLE
LIFE. All work and no play makes
Jack an IC student, so break out and
exercise your right to be 'fun to be
with". I am sure that many closet
funny people are scared of being
persecuted for their perverse attitude
to life. A sense of humour is nothing
to be ashamed of! Flaunt it! Stand
proud and join Jest A Minute. If your
not into the fun scene you don't have
to wear the red nose or floppy boots,
but merely exercise your humour in
a locked room between consenting
adults. Thus, gaining confidence in
your right to be funny, you might try
a quick 'gag' in the bar and thence
onto 'pranks' all over college.
If you are interested in joining our
movement, or helping others to
realise their identity as funny people
contact us via Box No 1, FELIX Office.
Lots of love. Chief HA.
