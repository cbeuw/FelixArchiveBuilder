THEATRE CENSORSHIP
One of the most unpopu-
lar of the many jobs held by
the Lord Chamberlain used
to be that of censor of all
stage productions in this
country. Despite five parlia-
mentary inquiries into whe-
ther this post ought to be
abolished, it was not until
September that a gover-
ment passed an act to re-
move it.
Under the Theatres Act
of 1843 all plays publicly
staged in Britain and per-
formed by unpaid actors be-
fore paying audiences had
to have a licence issued by
the Lord Chamberlain. By
this act he was able to ban
a play or parts of a play as
long as he considered it ne-
cessary for " the preserva-
ion of good manners, de-
corum or the public peace "
to do so. There was no ap-
peal to his verdict through
either Parliament or the
Law Courts.
History
The whole history of di-
rectives from the Lord
Chamberlain reflects the
moral tone of society at the
particular time; thus in
Victorian times censorship
was so strictly enforced that
Charles Kingsley was forced
to say " few highly educated
men now think it worthwhile
to go to see any play . . .
and still fewer educated men
think it worthwhile to write
plays"; and in the period
prior to the abolition the
position was relatively free.
It must be pointed out, how-
ever, that even in times such
as these, censorship still
placed great restrictions on
what could be staged, and
thus Harold Pinter moved a
play from the stage to Radio
3, where the one word which
the Lord Chamberlain
found objectionable could be
spoken.
Following the abolition of
the Lord Chamberlain's post
as censor, the moral welfare
of the public now rests in its
own hands. Any person or
group (e.g. local councils)
can bring proceedings on
the basis of Common Law
on such charges as obscene
performances, incitement to
racial violence and libel.
(It is perhaps interesting to
note that the charge is libel
rather than slander). These
actions are brought via the
Attorney General, who thus

becomes i n effect the post-

Since the abolition a num-
ber of plays have appeared
in London which could not
have taken the same form in
the days of the Lord Cham-
berlain. In " Fortune and
Mens Eyes" (Comedy
Theatre) genitals are the
only form of dress and in
"The Beard" (late night,
Royal Court) swear words
are used with gay abandon.
At the time of writing, no
charges have been brought
against any productions,
suggesting a commendable
leniency on the part of either
or both of the public and
the Attorney General, with
regard to the question of
obscenity.

At the Student Residence Committee meeting last
week, we were presented with a new and very far reaching
fuggestion. The idea is to increase the number of freshers
!a hall from the present total Of about 25 per cent to a
hew figure of over 50 per cent. This has been suggested
to make life easier for freshers, who perhaps have
the most difficulty in finding good accommodation in
London. However, apart from drastically cutting down the
chances of other students who want to get into residence,
this system could produce very large changes in the pattern
ef life in H a l l It was decided not to take any decision
until the beginning of next month, and in the meantime
we have agreed to find out what the student opinion is.
This change would make a lot of difference to the lives of. a
lot of students, so please let us know your views, either
through the Union Office, or through " Communicate," the
floor reps meeting on Monday and Friday lunchtimes.
Carnival is again hoping to break the record total of
money collected, and one profitable event could be the
All Night Charity Walk. This is due to start on the evening
of December 6th, just after the Swimming Gala, with
walkers setting out from Richmond, going via Kingston,
Claygate, Kingston and back to college ending with break-
fast in the Union. Many more walkers and sponsors are
required. Anyone who doesn't think I can walk 27 miles is
welcome to come and put his money down.
The President's Dinner and Dance, the final ball of the
College year, which is free and by invitation only, has again
been criticised by some Council members. It is meant to
be a reward for those people who have worked hard for
the Union'during the year, but it has been argued that
it-is a waste of the Union's money. One totally unknown
piece of information is the attitude of the average Union
member, who may well not be personally involved. So once
again, all opinions will be very welcome.
WELLS SOC. GHOSTS
Last Thursday night, the
H. G. Wells Society's Ghost
Grodp held its first meeting
of the term, on Tizard Hall
Gallery. The speaker was
Grace Rosher, a well-
known " automatic writ-
ing " medium, who de-
scribed her apparent ability
to receive written messages
by h_r own hand, but in the
styles of deceased persons.
The evidence in favour ot
her claim consis'ed of a film
showing her writing with a
pen barely touching only
the side of one finger, a pro-
fessional graphologist's tes-
timony to the effect that the
messages she was receiving
could only have been writ-
ten by certain persons, now
long deceased ; and an op-
portunity for members of
the audience to compare
for themselves samples of
her messages with samples
of writing made during the
lives of the now deceased
" communicators."
The expected hostility in
the audience's reaction to
her claim did not materia-
lise significantly, and she
seemed to stand up quite
well to the questions asked
after her talk. Most of the
discussion was relevant to
the subject, although the
conversation of certain
groups managed somehow
to digress to the fallacies of
quantum mechanics, the
possibility of forging
cheques, and whether there
was lots of sex in the "after-
life." A n attempt by one
notable sceptic to perform
automatic wri<ins failed to
produce much more than
the trails one would expect
from an inky spider; ob-
viously, spirit-spiders were
trying to get through.
Probably some of the
members returned home to
sit hopefully with pens on
paper; any success should
be immediately reported in
writing, preferably in the
member's own style, to the
Ghost Group. Does this
phenomenon happen ? It is
not for us to say, as we are
not in possession of all the
evidence for and against her
case ; however, the evening
served its purpose in offer-
ing an intriguing case which
was worthy of a scientific
challenge from sceptical IC
students. Grace Rosher's
comment to me afterwards?
—" They were very kind,
and I liked them. They're
a nice bunch."
