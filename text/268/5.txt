Who says constituent col-
lege Unions are useless?
Certainly not W H O (the
Wooden Horse Club—
guardian of IC mascot
Mike. ICU, on which the
three constituent college
Presidents sit, voted by 8 to
7 (that 7 including two con-
stituent college Presidents)
not to pay Kings College
£15 for the giant size micro-
meter Kings had stolen. For-
tunately, the much travelled
Mike was saved by £5 from
each of the constituent Col-
lege Unions. Where do the
Unions get their money?
ICU Council—of course.

Chris—" come uo and see
me sometime" Kent, the
well known wine-taster, is
determined to remain an in-
dividualist; which is some-
times rather difficult when
one is on as many commit-
tees as Chris—Council, RCS
General Committee, Wel-
fare, Student Houses, Con-
stitutional Reform, Selkirk
Hall and Wine-Tasting Soc.
Kent, who first rose to fame
in the Maths Department as
an indefatigable algebra
theorem numberer, refuses
to belong to either of the two
" cliques " on Council and
recently demonstrated his
individualism by getting up
at 5.30 on Sunday morning,
doing 90 minutes work and
going for a walk on Hamp-
stead Heath.
Our bearded Union Re-
fec. Complaints officer,
Chris's latest job, claims
that rumours that he cannot
put in enough time on all
the committees he is now on
are rubbish. Rob Collinge,
Welfare officer is said to
have other ideas. In any
case even stronger rumour
has it that Kent would like
at the end of the year to ter-
minate his role as a bureau-
crat and become President
of R.C.S.—-if he thinks that
the job would suit him.

General opinion of IC
Debates Mock trial of feex
Lowin seems to be rather
low. In the allegedly hu-
morous farce Rex, President
of I.C.U., was found guilty
of running the Union in a
spirit contrary to demo-
cracy. Ebullient Chris
Parker, Debates President,
claims he intended that the
whole affair should show to
ordinary Union members
how I.C.U. Works, and his
incredible little homily at
the end, in which he en-
joined us all to flock to save
I.C.U. as an institution,
seemed to bear this out.
•• • •
However one fresher
thought that it was appal-
ling that all a Union Presi-
dent in 1968 could claim he
had done was -to try and set
ur> at mirserv. The fantastic-
ally superficial nature of the
proceedinqs was fiirfi-lishted
by the fact that the cast in
the poorly scripted, totally
in-crowd, epic were mostly
equally culpable, as Union
Officers, of failing demo-
cracy by failing to deal with
the important issues that
concern us.. As one former
Debates President put. i t :
" it seemed to succeed in
one major object only, the
self-glorification of Parker."

They have been telling me
the most extraordinary
things about the staff in this
college. There is a rumour
that South-Side Bar was
closed at 9.30 p.m. one
Thursday because five of the
Mech. Eng. staff insisted in
doing press-ups there.
Rumours from the green
and pleasant land of Chem.
Eng. say that-
a former stu-
dents' common room area
has been taken over as a
private shower—and that
this shower is near to the,
room of the Head of De-
partment ! But then I
daren't print everything I'm
told.
LES E B D O N
MORADE - The Movement
for the Re-thinking of Art and
Design Education was formed
last summer in the midst of
deep-rooted confrontations at
Guildford and Hornsey art
colleges between groups of
students and staff and govern-
ing bodies and their admini-
strations. The long term aim
of MORADE is in its name,
the short term activities are
to collect and disseminate
ideas, promote national dis-
cussions, co-ordinate and orga-
nise events to bring about
reforms in specific cases whe-
re they are needed.
N. U. S.
M O R A D E consists of stu-
dents, staff (studentsandstaff),
artists, designers, educa-
tionalists, ordinary people,
drawn from many art
schools and universities, etc.
NUS also are belatedly sup-
porting Morade (only after
initially failing miserably
to do anything for the
art college situation them-
selves).
BAD VIBRATIONS
C l a s h
A I M S -
C O N T R O L — T o the un-
invwlved scientist the prob-
lems of the art colleges are
very complicated. The pri-
mary concern of Morade is
the continual clash between
organisational and educa-
tional imperatives as mani-
fested in the almost perma-
nent " bad vibrations " be-
tween the administrators and
educational rectors of the
art colleges. It is not possible
to do good creative work in
an atmosphere of bad will.
Morade states that art col-
leges should be bqsed on
educational rather than ad-
ministrational imperatives.
The organisation of a school
should be a R E S U L T of
the educational process con-
trolled by the studentsand
staff, N O T imposed on the
school by often remote and
uninformed groups (the
boards of Governors and
L E A ' s who frequently im-
pose their conservative lack
of ideas onto the art colleges
as if they v^ere dealing with
secondary schools.)
Morade is campaigning
PIERS CORBYN outlines the feelings and activities
of MORADE, the movement which sprang np from the
educational ruins of Guildford and Hornsey.
for the transfer of financial
and educational control
from the L E A ' s to the art
colleges themselves, the
money forthcoming by a
direct grant system.
Creativity
Secondary school educa-
tion severely subordinates
creativity to external autho-
rity—syllabuses and exami-
nations, etc. Morade be-
leives that G.C.E.'s are of-
ten quite irrelevant ias to
entrance qualifications to
essentially creative institu-'
tions like art colleges. For
the same reasons Morade
holds that because a student
on entering art college is un-
trained in developing his
own creativity the art school
must "facilitate the transi-
tion from imposed to ex-
ploratory learning." This
can only be done if there is
w
C ^Deration between stu-
dents and teachers (hence
studentsandstaff) and if there
is free access to many diffe-
rent disciplines in the art
school.
Choice
Many bureaucratic L E A s
and governing bodies (who
often have a high number of
military men on them) pre-
fer to install "linear"
courses of art " education "
rather than allow interdisci-
plinary studies. More linear
courses usually means more
diploma courses and hence
a higher status to the school.
A more or less free choice
of resources M U S T be al-
lowed if the student is to
develop real creativity, so
Morade believes in the vital
importance of Foundations
Courses and the need for
" continuous creation of
courses to fit group and in-
diviTVjal needs.."
Mo'rade believes that be-
cause of the subjectivity of
art. work many assessments
do not have the value which
is often placed in them.
S o c i e t y
Art is a reflection of the
whole of society so art
schools must never be dic-
tated to and must never be-
come isolated from their
social environment.
M e t h o d s
The methods of Morade
are all-fold: letter"writing to
M.P.s and D.E.S. etc, lobby-
ing (see article), demonstra-
tions, marches in order to
open Public Enquiries. In
the short term Morade will
concentrate on specific is-
sues : for example the ap-
palling situation at Hornsey
(see last Felix), the staff
dismissals at Guildford etc.,
etc., the closing of the Foun-
dation Course in the Cen-
tral School of Art. and so
on.
A p p e a l
In future Morade needs
to organise more meetings
and more lobbies, circulate
mOr£ information and pro-
mote more discussions in
newspapers. For all this
Morade has issued an ap-
peal to all colleges and uni-
versities for £25. The issues
involved are far wider than
art colleges—they are about
education as a whole—what
happens in Guildford now
may be a precedent to what
could happen in any univer-
sities in a few years time.
Look at the problems ! Are
art colleges really so alien?
Does I.C. allow you to "dis-
cover " science ?

BLUE SMOKE
A icene from the winning sketch at the RCS smoking concert,
the Schoolroom Sketch.
Last Thursday the R.C.S.
Smoking Concert provided
the expected obscene night
out for an audience of
about 400. This included
about 30 non-males (ladies
do not attend, by defini-
tion). Although the organ-
isers were prepared for
trouble, last year's riotous,
drunken behaviour was not
repeated, and the show
therefore made a large
profit.
A well-lubricated cast,
including several women,
p-ovided about 18 sketches,
most of which were intro-
duced by " Adolf," who re-
peatedly confirmed that he
was, quote, " pissed," un-
quote. The winning sketch,
chosen by acclamation from
five finalists, was a school-
room scene, though the sub-
ject of the lesson appeared
rather vague.
As usual, the audience
reactions provided the most
(and in place the only)
amusement, as many
sketches were too obscene
to be funny. Many watch-
ers, especially freshers,
thought the sketches using
subtlety and innuendo were
preferable to undisguised
crudity. The only repeat-
able sketch was the " Cross-
ing of the Red Sea," in
which a large red letter C
was drawn across the stage.
Despite the failure yet
again of the bar to supply
enough glasses, the evening
provided a few hours per-
verted entertainment.

Next Monday is the final copy date for PHOENIX.
Rush your contributions now, to John Mullaly,
c/o Union (Felix) rack, or Martin Moyes, Beit 56.
The fullness of time approaches. Make it happen!
