4 FELIX 27 November 1968
In this issue, Piers Corbyn explains the ideas behind
M O R A D E , the organisation trying to change some of the
traditional concepts of Art education. In his last para--
graph he says, " The issues involved are far wider than art
colleges—they are about education as a whole—what hap-
pens in Guildford now, may well be a precedent to what
could happen in any university in a few years time." The
main issue as I see it is the stifling of creativity, from which
stems the need for good staff-student relations and for
access to different diciplines within the art school.
Is there such a stifling of creativity at Imperial Col-
lege ? I think it is indisputable that in most departments
the syllabus is regarded as the be-all and end-all of Univer-
sity life. This is what the student is given to learn and
only this will pass him his exams. Any extra-curricular
knowledge he may desire to pick up will be of little or no
use to him academically and realising this, the majority
of students do not bother to take an interest in matters out-
side their immediate field of study. This tends to narrow
the mind of student with the result that his overall educa-
tion suffers. Although there are limited opportunities for
some undergraduates to study in various departments-
Physics 3rd year options offer courses in Mines, Elec. Eng.
and Meteorology—on the whole Imperial College tends to
turn out a person incredibly well versed in one subject but
apathetic about anything else.
To generalise a bit more, it is fairly noticeable that
few people at this college take an active interest in things
like politics or literature. The rudimentary courses in
these, and similar non-scientific subjects, that take place
around college seem to generate a lack of interest in those
students taking them. Few peoplemake any sort of contact
with R.C.A. and other local colleges despite the energetic
(though somewhat unco-ordinated) efforts of the External
Affairs Committee. Let us hope that the arrival of the
Architectural Association at some time in the future will
help broaden the outlook of the I.C. student.
On a different plane let's turn to the mindless morons
who have an uncontrollable urge to scribble on things. The
lift in the Union becomes more and more pornographic as
time goes on. Repeating the standard joke, it may well
soon be appearing in paperback form. Seriously though,
it doesn't say much for the people at this college if some
of them seem to spend half their waking lives scribbling
graffiti all over the place. This may be creativity of a sort,
but . . .
In a previous " Comment," we noted that it was about
time Southside had a fire drill. We are pleased to see that
one has been arranged.

Morphy Day Defended
Sir,
I should like to reply to
the letter last week of Mr.
George Assimakis, the floor
rep., who claims to be rep-
resentative of the whole of
IC's public opinion. He
states, in excusably dis-
jointed English, that the
two persons were injured
during Morphy Day vio-
lence. I'm not surprised!
The level of intelligence that
drives people into a running
turnip battle, wearing a pair
of spectacles, is similar to
that of many IC students,
whose thirst for " A " levels
has deprived them of acquir-
ing a little common sense.
As for the man with the
carved-up knee, perhaps I
can tell you of my good
friend who has just lost a
knee-cap through his devo-
tion to sport. In his case
any different? Both volun-
teered to "play." Both
were injured accidentally. If
you really consider that the
throwing of squashy pears,
rotten sprouts and the oc-
casional rigid turnip is a
violent pursuit, I feel it my
duty to warn you against
the blood-thirsty, brutal
English game of rugby,
where casualties are so
frequent that one barely has
time to write about them.

Negative Attitudes
Sir,
I would like to reply to
your front page article, edi-
torial, and G. Assimakis'
letter in the last issue. I
realise it was very unfortu-
nate that two people were
so seriously injured on
Morphy Day but these were
accidents like those that
happen every day in the
pursuit of sport. A recur-
rence of these will be pre-
vented as far as possible by
consultation between the
college presidents. Other
than this I believe that most
people who went along had
an enjoyable afternoon.
It seems to me that the
article about Morphy Day is
typical of the negative atti-
tude taken by F E L I X about
almost everything that is
happening around IC. There
appears to be little respect
for reporting the facts in an
unbiased form. I certainly
did not drink " a complete
bottle of whiskey " on the
Brighton Run (a half bottle
is my limit) and to accuse
the candidates for Mr.
ICWA and their proposers
of being " all well lubri-
cated" on one pint is a gross
insult.
Isn't it about time F E L I X
started to take a positive at-
titude to what is going on
which might help arouse
more interest. Y o u may
well " love writing drivel
with everyone else on
F E L I X to help you," but I,
for one, don't like reading
it.
Yours sincerely,
D E R M O T T C O R R
Fine ldeas&Intentions
Dear Sir,
The mock trial of Rex
Lowin arranged by Debates
Soc. was, one supposed, a
light-hearted platform from
which the President could
make known his serious
point of view and the ap-
proach he has to I.C. Union.
A soft-sell for some hard-
hitting policies and a good
idea perhaps.
In fact I've seen funnier
sketches written by third
formers, but that aside, the
idea evidently was to give
the impression that it was all
a jolly good joke to 1am-
poon Lowin but I.C. Union
must be all right really if its
President has such fine ideas
and good intentions.
The ideas Lowin put for-
ward were as unsophisti-
cated as the farce itself:
" Communications have im-
proved " he said. " Students
can now get cut-price in-
surance " he added to an
audience which was stag-
gered to learn this was what
the President thought they
really wanted. To have the
President " prosecuted " by
someone as involved in the
bureaucracy as Dermott
Corr is evidence of the de-
political nature of the event.
There was no mention of
presidential elections, whe-
ther or not to join the N U . S .
and the abolition of the con-
stituent college system,
which are hardly revolution-
ary issues and would only
begin to make I.C. Union
into a democratic, non-re-
actionary institution which
was not controlled from the
top but structured to en-
courage student involvement
and decrease apathy.

D U N C A N - J O N E S
Chairman, Socialist Soc.
O.S.C. Election
The Overseas Student
Committee was formed last
year as a subcommittee of
S.C.C. composed of all the
chairmen of the various
Societies on S.C.C. and its
aims were to look after the
general welfare of the over-
seas students at I.C.
Since the people on it
were only ex-officio mem-
bers, the committee was
hardly representative of the
main body of the overseas
students, and its members
were little interested in its
affairs so the committee
hardly accomplished any-
thing last year.
This year it was agreed
that the committee should be
transferred to the welfare
committee and its members
will be elected by an annual
general meeting of all the
overseas students. This
meeting will be held this year
on Thursday 5th December
at 1.00 p.m. in the Union
Concert Hall.
Wellsoc.
We are told that Wells
Soc. has 850 members al-
ready. Rumour has it that
should this figure rise to 950,
Mr. John Spence will "ap-
pear " in his " night attire "
(would you believe pyja-
mas?) to canvas for the
extra members needed to
make the magic 1,000.
Surely there are 100 mem-
bers of the Union who are
prepared to join Wells Soc.
just to provide this spec-
tacle.
Parking
Points
Dear Sir,
I should like to clarify
the situation concerning the
locations within the College
precincts where students are
allowed to park their cars.
The most important fact
is that only those who have
been allocated " S , " " S c , "
and " D " stickers are al-
lowed to park in these zones
during the day, from Mon-
day to Fridav.
Only residents with " S "
stickers are allowed to park
in the zone behind Linstead
(and on the ramp) at any
time of the week. For this
privilege s they are inot Jo
park in the zone in front of
Southside. This zone is re-
served during College hours
for commuters with " Sc "
stickers. However, in the
evenings and at weekends
this is open to anyone. The
same rule applies to " D "
zone, in the old Imperial
Institute Road.
The Union has the right
to repeal stickers from stu-
dents making incorrect u£e
of Vim, and to evict^any
cars not having the authority
to park in these zones.
One further point is that
Research Assistants who are
members of the Senior Com-
mon Room are not eligible
for Union parking spaces.
Yours faithfully,
D. FOSTER
(Chairman, Residents'
Parking Committee)
Consoc.
Agrees
Dear Sir,
Elsewhere in this issue,
you print a letter from Mat-
thew Duncan-Jones. This is
one of the few occasions on
which we can agree whole-
heartedly with the Chairman
of the Socialist Society.
Whilst there can be no
doubt that Chris Parker is
succeeding, against over-
whelming odds, at his self-
appointed task of making
Debates better attended and
more interesting, one feels
that this is an event which
could well have been omitted
from the programme of
the Debating Society, as
it was not even up to the
standard of the most child-
ish constituent college meet-
ings.
