• FELIX 27 November 1968
In another week or so
you will see all these girls
photographs and many
more on notice boards
about college.
Then you will have
a chance to choose
the
•4c 4
JANE ASHTON from Mech. Eng.I was runner-
up as "belle for Bo" but was definitely the
leading lady. She denies the title of... for
Corr but many have been engineering for her
favours.
LIZ BUDDEN was the star of the R.C.S. Smo-
king Concert and hails from Chemistry 3. A
short, well-endowed blonde, she claims that
living on 4th floor Beit keeps her in trim.
CAROLINE GROUNDWATER from Elec.Eng.3
has definite "girl next-door" appeal. She has
blonde hair and blueeyes, which light up to give
an electrifying effect. She is interested in music
and plays it all hours of the day and night.
SUZANNE JONES is a vivacious mini-bud from
Elec. Eng. 2, with long hair and bright dark
eyes. She has a strong interest in the Sub-aqua
Slub — we all know it's a great experience
underwater.
NIKKI MOUNTENAY of Geology 2 with her
blonde hair and angelic smile is no common ore
but a precious jewel. She usually hides her
beauty under a duffle coat and college scarf
because she never likes to get cold..
PIPPA ROSSETTI from Geology 2 has long,
chestnut hair and deep, dark eyes, with a subtle
sexy glint. Contrary to appearances, she is quite
ah expert on the life of Winnie-the-Pooh and is
crazy about cuddly animals.
HELEN RUDGE is a member of Civ. Eng. 2 who
started off life as a Mathematician. She decided
that figures were not her strongest point so she
went in for structures instead. She certainly
adds to council meetings!
IZA SONGIN has long black hair and long legs.
Although she only joined Geology in October
she has proved a rich deposit and is in constant
demand. -Let's hope that she doesn't get
overworked.
Contrary to popular rumour, C.C.Seaford,
Domestic Bursar, will not be standing
for this contest.
