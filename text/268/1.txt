At the A G M of I.A.E.-
S.T.E., the international
association for providing
students with summer work
abroad, it was decided to
abandon the controversial
proposal to charge a £1 re-
gistration fee to all students
applying for jobs. Such a fee
would have been totally un-
fair as the possibility of get-
ting a job was only one hi
three last year.
However increases have
been introduced, among
them a rise in the placement
fee from £1 10s. to £3 10s.
This fee will be charged to
all those who obtain jobs
through I.A.E.S.T.E.
Last year I.A.E.S.T.E.
found jobs for students in
countries ranging from Ire-
land to Japan. For those
interested, further informa-
tion can be obtained from
the departments.
Blood
A mobile Blood Trans-
fusion unit will be visiting
the college on Monday and
Tuesday the 9th and 10th
Dec.
Well over a million dona-
tions are needed each year
as medical research con-
tinually discovers new ways
of restoring health by trans-
fusion. Sometimes up to 30
bottles are needed for one
patient.
The process of donation
is quite painless and the
body soon replaces the lost
blood.
If you can spare half an
hour on either of the two
dates, please come along
and sign up on the board in
the Union. Remember,
your blood can save a life.

NEWSP'.PER OF THE IMPERIAL COLLEGE STUDENTS UNION
WEDNESDAY, 27 NOVEMBER 1968
PRICE 4d

Mike, the Imperial College mascot, has at last returned
to its rightful place in the possession of the Wooden Horse
Organisation. It was bought back at an auction held at
Kings College almost a fortnight ago.
On that Friday night 75
Left Wing Challenge
at NUS Conference
NUS moderates had a
tough day last Saturday zl
the Union conference in
Margate, They just suc-
ceeded in beating off a
strong left-win" challenge
to their authority.
The main debate was on
a proposed amendment to
the constitution, to allow
political issues to be dis-
cussed at NUS conferences.
At present the conference is
confined to educational
issues. The two-thirds ma-
jority necessary to alter the
constitution was narrowly
missed, the card vote being
169,097 for, 87,541 against,
with 5,166 abstentions.
A n alternative amend-
ment allowing the union to
discuss race issues, was pro-
posed by Alun Evans, the
vice-president. " The Union
must take a stand against
Powellism," Evans de-
clared. His motion was de-
feated, but the conference
later adopted a motion call-
ing for an " open door"
policy on immigration.
In a speech the day be-
fore, Geoff Martin, the
President, hit out at re-
reaction and revolution in
the university world.
*' There is a real possibility
that the frightening
'Powellite' hysteria of the
right, and the wild-eyed ex-
tremists of the left are bent
on a course leading to vio-
lence," he declared.
He outlined negotiations
the NUS have had with the
Vice-Chancellors and the
Association of Education
Committees. He considered
that other educational
unions were " far behind us
in influence, ideas and suc-
C 3 S S . "
Turning to the student
militants, Martin con-
tinued : " When the name
of students is being kicked
into the gutter by profes-
sional agitators, many of
whom are non-students
from parasite organisations,
then the NUS must face
the problem." Revolution-
ary socialism was " a threat
to freedom of speech and a
challenge to democracy."
Finally he appealed to
the NUS to put its confer-
ence in order. It was be-
coming a farce and fewer
delegates had attended
Margate than usual.
peonle from I.C. descended
on Kings College Union pre-
pared to gain possession of
Mike by fair means or foul.
There seem to have been
two factions of W.H.O. at
King's; one, led by Frank
Morris, were busily sawing
tirough the chains holding
Mike. Although they were
surrounded by Kings people
there was a bar party going
on and their actions went
unnoticed. The 181 lb. lump
of metal was to be auctioned
at 10 o'clock and John
Auger, who claimed to be
Chairman of W.HvO .(much
to W.H.O.s surprise) had ar-
ranged that the bidding
should stop at £15 with I.C.
holding the floor.
Near Riots
Council had refused to
put up this money, but it
was raised from Constituent
College funds. The auction
took place earlier than was
planned owing to the impa-
tience of John Auger. This,
unknown to him, foiled an
attempt to steal Mike back.
Although bidding went up
to £17, I C . was given the
key to the chains holding
Mike for £15 cash after
Auger had threatened to
" smash the place up." A
red-painted Mike was
hustled into a mini-van which
was driven off with rather
more noise than speed. The
remainder of the mob'hutled
insults at everything' and
Kings in particular until they
got fed up and returned
home, most of them without
having caught a glimpse of
Mike.
Unnoticed
After a rather circuitous
route through London there
came the triumphal return.
A few heads turned away
for a fleeting moment from
the goggle box, someone
even clapped—but on the
whole the arrival of Mike
back in Southside was not
quite the occasion that was
anticipated by most of the
glory seeking members of
the W H O . A n attempt to
bring Mike into Guilds-
Mines carnival was foiled as
few of the bearers had
tickets.
1975?
Mike will not be returned
to its plinth until all the
alarm systems are working.
At the present rate of pro-
gress this should be at about
the end of 1975, but perhaps
when W.H.O. has sorted
out its own petty internal
strike it may deem to re-
turn Mike to its owners.
