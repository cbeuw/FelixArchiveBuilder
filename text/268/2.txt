MOONEY
TO GOUP?
At the annual accounts meeting of I.C. Refectory
Committee the possibility of increases in both Refec-
tory and beer prices was discussed. The former was
brought up despite an overall profit of £4,000 last /session,
the reason being that a 4 per cent increase in the wages of
Refectory staff is coming up. The decision whether to
increase prices will be made at the next Refectory Com-
mittee meeting later this term when M r . Mooney will be
able to produce figures as to how demand for meals is going
this year. One point which will have to be considered is
the advice from the U.G.C. that a decrease in standards is
preferred to an increase in prices.
Although the price of beer
was raised by Id. for the
Summer term last session,
this was either not enough
or too late to prevent a loss
of £610 in the Union bar
and £220 in Southside. A
suggestion was made that
part of this loss might be
due to an inefficient stock-
taker (now replaced) who, it
was suggested, counted
empty bottles. Losses of
glasses were also reported as
being a source of income
loss. The decision now rests
with the next meeting of the
refectory Committee, who
have referred the matter to
the Wine sub-committee.
Shop Stock
The Southside shop also
came under discussion. M r .
Moonev is trvine to arrange
for the hours of opening to*
be re-arranged to give an ex-
tension until 6 p.m. Mr.
Mooney is open to sugges-
tion as to what the shop
should stock (no contracep-
tives! ).
Under the arrangements
made for Refectories when
the College Block comes into
use the pie and chips Re-
fectory will be replaced by
a similar service in the Col-
lege Block, open from 10
a.m.-8 p.m. The suggestion
that a room should be avail-
able for a Hall dinner every
evening was also made.
The coffee bar will remain
open, and the possibility of
it being staffed by I.C.W.A.
next term is being con-
sidered.
A new milk machine is to
be installed on a months free
trial at the beginning of
next term, in the Union
snack bar. The cartons will
be filled on insertion of the
coin, and it is said to work
every time. If it is a success
it will be bought at a cost of
£250, and the present ma-
chines will be reconditioned.
Tinkers&Diz
The folk club is at the
moment enjoying great
popularity with several well
known performers paying
visits to I.C.
A fortnight ago the
Tinkers appeared and gave
a performance of mostly
traditional Irish music. They
reinforced their act with
much chat and this in com-
bination with a sprinkle of
English and Scottish songs
made their performance
highly entertaining.
The following week Diz
Dizley appeared. Diz is a
great entertainer and is
guaranteed to get any folk
club going. His performance*
consisted mainly of tradi-
tional, bawdy, English songs
which he interspersed with
jokes in the same vein. Diz
Dizley was ably supported
by members of I.C. folk
club which made the whole
performance an enjoyable
one.

P. P. Arnold in action at Guilds-Mines CarnivaL
RY.G. MAKES
A LOSS
This years Guilds-Mines
Carnival made a loss of
about £250 despite a last
minute publicity campaign.
Only 230 tickets were sold
out of a hoped for 300. This
is amazing when you con-
sider what good value for
money a Carnival ticket is.
For £1 each you get a two
course meal, dancing to at
least one " big name"
group, as well as several
supporting groups, free cof-
ee bars and a film.
The theme "Play Your
Game " brought out many
ingenious costumes which
threw interesting light on
the favourite pastimes of
I.C. students. Inevitably
rugger shirts were very
much in evidence but the
favourite game appeared to
involve the man wearing
pyjamas and the girl wearing
a night dress! The prize, a
bottle of whisky, for the
most original costume was
won by Graham Blackey
(Elec. Eng. P.G.) and his
partner, who were playing
croquet.
The film shown was
Mamie. Unlike most Car-
nival films, few people had
seen it before. On the whole
the groups were good al-
though whether you like P.
P. Arnold is definitely a
mater of taste.
Those who went to the
Guilds-Mines Carnival had
a very enjoyable evening but
it would have been better if
more people had been there.
Things tended to quieten
down when half the people
were eating or watching the
film. The success of a car-
nival depends largely on the
number of people who go.
So watch out for the R.C.S.
Carnival and come along
and support it.
MORADE
LOBBY
Last Wednesday, MORADE, the Movement for Re-
thinking of Art and Design Education, inarched on the
Department of Education and Science and then on to the
Houses of Parliament to lobby MJ.'s with a view to
getting a public enquiry into the state of education at
Guildford College of Design (ex school of art). A petition
was handed in at the D.EJS. and the M.P.S lobbied with
MORADES views.
The lohby was organized
at a meeting held in this
college un Friday, 15th
November. This gathering
discussed tne situation at
Guildford as well as the
organisation and publicity
of the following Wednes-
day's lobby. A staff mem-
ber at Guildford described
the predicament of the col-
lege and then outlined the
many greivances.
Grievances
Following the sit-in last
summer seven full time and
thirty part time staff who
had supported the students
were dismissed. Several im-
portant courses were closed
down withobt consultation
with either staff or students.
After this the Association of
Teachers in Technical Insti-
tutes blacked the school.
The administration (head of
school with a small group
of departmental heads) has
seemed to adopt a policy of
deceive, divide and rule.
Parents and selected staff
have had " meetings " from
which students were barred.
New students are being
actively discouraged from
" getting ideas."
With these fundamental
educational issues in mind,
over .300 demonstrators
started from the Royal Col-;
lege of Art on the Wednes-
day and strolled to the
D.E.S. in Curzon Street to
hand a petition in. Speakers
there included an informa-
tive staff member*, and
Trevor Fisk, secretary of
N.U.S., who was not well
received. The marchers left
for speakers corner for more
militant speeches, including
a condemnation of Educa-
tion Minister Short for being
unable to meet the demon-
strators':
M.P's Agree
Taking buses to Parlia-
ment Square, M O R A D E
proceeded to lobby M.P.'s
who seemed to agree with
the idea of a public enquiry
into education at Guildford.
One M . P . even stated that
he was a very radical left
supporter — probably the
News of the World would
like his name.
A.A. Appeal
The Architectural Asso-
ciation who are projected
to become I.C.'s 4th con-
stituent college are at the
moment in the process of
raising the £500,000 neces-
sary to pay for new build-
ing that it needs.
The lease on their old
building in Bedford Square
runs out in eight years but
the Government will pro-
vide the money for the pro-
posed new site at 191-194
Queens Gate. A condition
of them coming under the
wing of I C . is that they
should be able to find the
money to erect a new build-
ing on this site. This is also
a condition for the A . A . ob-
taining a grant from the
Universities Grants Com-
mittee to cover their run-
ning costs.
An appeal has been
launched to try and raise
this £500,000, an appeal
box office has been set up at
34-36 Bedford Square, and
information being sent out
to members of the A . A ;
throughout the world. Over
£85,000 has already been
collected and they hope to
get the rest from donations
f-orn * numbers and from
institutions and businesses
connected with architecture.
