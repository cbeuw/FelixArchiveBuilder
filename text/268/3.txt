FELIX 27 November 1968 3
PETER MEE, Registrar, writes about how to obtain Careers advice
For many years now careers advice has been provided
at the College through the machinery of the Appointments
Board—a Committee of the Governing Body —which was
reformed in 1920 in order to " assist students to obtain
situations, to assist employers to find men most suitable
for their purposes and to keep records -of old students
appointments and to aid in their transfer from one post to
another.'
Decentralisation
The work of the Board
within the College is
largely decentralised. In
each department a mem-
ber of staff with a special
interest in students' careers
acts as the appointments
representative and thus stu-
dents can be advised by
members of staff who either
have, or can easily obtain,
direct knowledge of their
standing or capabilities and
who are in touch with the
trend of employment in the
fields concerned. It is open
to the prospective employer
to deal direct with the de-
partmental appointments
representatives or with the
Secretary of the Board.
When an employer wishes
to see students from more
than one department ar-
rangements are co-ordin-
ated so that interviews may
all be held in one depart-
ment.
Problems
This has been the sys-
tem which has developed
in the College but consider-
ation has been given during
the last session to extend-
ing the service available to
students. The strength of
the present arrangement
—the intimate knowledge
of the trends in employ-
ment in the particular fields
known to the departmental
appointments representative
—as also its weakness when
more general advice is re-
quired or information is
sought about careers in
fields not directly related to
the departmental discip-
lines. This is an increasing
problem in the current day
and age when young scien-
tists and technologists are
being offered a wider range
of options in their degree
studies and when career op-
portunities for scientists and
engineers in such fields as
commercial as well as in-

A wide range of careers for men and women
taking RESEARCH or HONOURS DEGREES in
1969 is available in the Establishments of the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
There are also posts for Graduates with
PASS and ORDINARY DEGREES.

dustrial management, jour-
nalism, advertising, market-
ing and sales and indeed in
many other fields, which
had previously blindly re-
lied on Arts graduates, are
becoming available.
Field Offices
The University of London
Appointments Board, in
Bloomsbury, is available to
all our students, but there
seemed the need to make
such general information
and advice as the University
Board could provide more
easily accessible to I.C. stu-
dents. It has been ar-
ranged therefore that, from
the beginning of next term,
the College will share in the
University Appointments
Board's "Field Office Ser-
vice."
A few years ago follow-
ing the appointment of its
new Secretary Mr. E. H . K.
Dibden, the University Ap-
pointments Board explored
the possibility of interview-
ing students in their own
Colleges where a careers
advisory service was not al-
ready in existence; for want
of a better term this devel-
opment was labelled the
" Field ( Tices Service.' '
This development has
proved so successful that
the Board now provides,
through this means, a full
scale careers advisory ser-
vice in many of the major
Colleges of the University.
Centralisation
From the beginning of
next term, it is intended
that this service will be
available to supplement the
existing appointments ar-
rangements in the College
and on every Wednesday
throughout term, Mr. P. A .
Ashworth, Deputy Secre-
tary of the University Ap-
pointments Board will be
attending the College to
give careers advice to stu-
dents
Other improvements in
the appointments arrange-
ments should materialise
when the various adminis-
trative sections of the Col-
lege occupy, next summer,
the new building currently
in the course of construc-
tion in the centre of the
College site. Then, within
the Registry area, there will
be a centralised careers
library, with literature on
open access shelves, to-
gether with interviewing
rooms, controlled and co-
ordinated by M r . Meacock.
Improvements
When this accommodtion
is available, the Field Offi-
cer Service will ooerate
from there, but until then
Mr. Ashworth will occupy
a " temporary home," the
location of which will be
announced as soon as pos-
sible. Although the imme-
diate loca'ion mav be tem-
rjnrary. the beginning of
1969 should see the incep-
tion of a major permanent
improvement in the ap-
pointments and careers ad-
vice available to students at
Imperial Colleze.
ICI will be selecting...
about 500 unblinkered graduates from British Universities in 1969. These
are the men and women who will have the initiative to keep this British
company expanding and diversifying at home and overseas. These are the
people who will be among tomorrow's managerial and research leaders.
Most of the vacancies we have will be
open to women as well as men, taking
both first and higher degrees. We shall
be looking for chemists, mechanical en-
gineers, chemical engineers, electrical
engineers, civil and other engineers,
physicists, mathematicians, arts gradu-
ates, economists, agriculturists and bio-
logical scientists.
Will you be one of those selected?
In the spring term ICI representatives
(who will usually be qualified in your
subject) will be visiting your university.
They will be ready to talk in detail about
the opportunities which Europe's largest
chemical company can offer: and about
the qualities it expects in potential staff.
If you wish to meet one of our repre-
sentatives, please contact your Univ'et^
sity Appointments Officer who will
arrange an interview for you. He will
also have preliminary information on
ICI careers.
