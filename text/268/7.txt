FELIX 27 November 1968 7
MOCKERY
OF ATRIAL
The Mock Trial of Rex Lowin was held last Tuesday
week. The charges against Lowin were various and
,numerous and even added to as the trial proceeded.
Amidst ribald flippantry from the disappointed audi-
ence, C. C. " Here come de Judge " Parker managed to
"let everybody know I am de Judge" by pronouncing
sentence on the guilty Lowin.
So ended the farcical, widely publicised ' " M o c k "
Trial' of our President.
EDWARD BOYLE
AT I.C.
The thought of London Dockers marching on White-
hall, singing " Land of Hope and Glory " was one of the
possibilities which would not have occurred to Sir Edward
Boyle at the beginning of 1968. Speaking on the " Political
Scene" at General Studies recently, Sir Edward also
found the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia and the
postponement of the raising of the school leaving age by
a " Socialist" government to be two other unpredictable
events.
The public, he said, were losing faith not only in the
present Government but in the House of Commons. The;
effect of the " end of Empire " and exclusion from Europe
had been under-estimated.
As far as reforming the
economy went, there were no
easy solutions—"hard work
and hard thinking" were the
only means.
Conservatives'
Education
" Our party," declared
Sir Edward, " has set large
store by education." The
Conservatives fully recog-
nised the need of a techno-
logical society for a supply
of highly educated people.
They supported reform at.
primary school level and
the speaker pointed out that
this would cause a need for
changes at Secondary
level. Some of the finan-
cial burden of education
should be carried by the
government, while industry
should be encouraged to
support the Universities.
Votes at 18
About the only comment
from Sir Edward even ap-
proaching the controversial
was that he believed that
Colcutt?
Dermott " i n the news"
Corr, prosecuting, produced
several pieces of evidence to
prove the guilt of the
prisoner, including Mike
that long (lost) tool, and
Robin Dibblee or, err, rather
Colcutt (the late). Snippings
of tape recordings on which
the arresting voice of Lowin
was heard were played to
the snoring crowds.
Un ion
Propaganda
What Corr lacked in con-
crete evidence Jane Pearson,
counsel for the defer.c?=
made up for with her occa-
sional attempts at serious
propaganda for the Union
and general lack of wit.
Parker's Newtonian satellite
alias " Sam Seed " alias an
actual grass root of the
Union was called as a wit-
ness and assistant Union
Propagandist.
Lowin, as final witness,
launched into a characteris-
tic gentle tirade of a speech
lasting several minutes and
definitely not answering any
specific questions asked by
counsellor Jane.
Hanging
After sentence Lowin was
hung in Prince's Gardens
along with Corr and Parker,
alas the noose being mis-
takenly changed for a spe-
cial harness.
Lost
Opportunity
One can only feel that the
Trial was an opportunity
lost for the Debating So-
ciety. The speeches were
generally bad and, it would
appear, mainly off-the-cuff.
Concentrating on trivialities
the speakers ignored all the
publicised charges and came
up time and again with irre-
levant facts which were not
even amusing.
Perhaps next year they
can try again.
the Conservatives would
gain from votes at 18. This
appears to run against the
general feeling in the na-
tional press that most 18-21
year olds would vote
Labour.
Tn answer to questions
relating to student affairs.
Sir Edward said that the in-
crease in grants was calcu-
lated by dividing the re-
commended increase by
two. He appreciated the
students' demands for more
democratic running of the
universities, and supported
militant protests on occa-
sions, as long as they did
not turn to violence. »

Scene: Lecture Theatre.
Someone falling off their seat
sound asleep. A spilt cup Of
coffee, slowly but surely, trick-
ing from the back of the lecture
theatre. A dart sailing down to-
wards the black-board,stalling
and pirouetting on a lecturer's
bald head.
You all know what its like when
this happens in an otherwise
boring lecture. Occasionally
the lecturer himself provides
the comic relief, dropping an
innocent,"loaded with innuen-
does'^rase.

Dear Aunt Vera,
I have recently noticed, much to my great concern,
that after giving lectures to a group which includes a certain
young lady, she persistently approaches me and embarrasses
me by talking about non-academic topics, and by trying to
stand close to me and touch me. Incidentally, do you think
it rather strange that she wears long evening dresses to
attend lectures? What can I do to escape quickly after

Dew Matthew,
I have received several similar letters (all from yo
department. 1 don't know what can be causing this gen
impropriety amongst young ladies at I.C. I can only sugg
it is due to misleading advice from othersl
There's little you can do to get rid of her easily since
as Confucius he say : " once a leach she stuck, she stay.
AUNT VERA
Dear Aunt Vera,
I am the vice chairman of a small society in I.C. ahd
I am passionately in love with the chairman, who I am
told is quite attracted to me. Although we often go about
together, it is always in a foursome and our relationship is
purely platonic. He already has a girlfriend in Ipswich
whom he occasionally goes to see. I have thought about
making him jealous by going out with other boys who have
asked me, but I know that this wiM only annoy him. Please,
please help me! M y work is beginning to suffer because
of my emotional turmoil. Life will not be worth living
unless my problem is resolved. Who can I turn to but you,
Aunt Vera?
In desperate anticipation,
