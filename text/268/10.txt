One of the happiest men in I.C. last Wednesday must
have been John Ballard, the Rugby captain, following the
1st XV's very good win in the Gutteridge Cup 1st Round.
All has not gone well with the 1st X V this year, but
now, after much hard work, John really has a team in the
full sense of the word. With luck (often elusive) and
barring too many injuries, they are going to be a good team
to beat.
With the Hockey team too, pulling off a similar
achievement, the Boat Club winning their first (of many ?)
regatta, and the Soccer Club making steady progress, we
look set for another good sport year for I.C.
Would the captains of the smaller clubs too, please
contribute to this page. The next copy date in Tuesday,
3rd December.
GOOD RECORD
FOR R.C.S.
RUGBY
This season is progressing
well for the R C S Rugby
Club, but there is still plenty
of room for improvement.
The second team, the
" Tankards," under the
captaincy of Dai Simms, are
on the brink of their finest
season in living memory;
with a record of five matches
won and one lost, 89 points
scored against 28, and re-
serves clamouring for games,
they have no worries at all.
The first team, with 12
old lags returning, looked
good on paper at the start
of the season, but when the
best combination had been
evolved, two players, Mike
Adams and Roy Anderson,
won places in the IC 1st X V
and were lost from RCS.
However their replacements
have performed nobly and
the first team record so far
is four matches won, one
drawn and two lost, with
171 points scored against 49.

I.C. IN
CONTROL
GUTTERIDGE C U P
Imperial College 38 pts.
Northern Poly 0.
As the score suggests I.C.
had quite a field day in their
first round Cup match
(U.L.U.) against Northern
Poly last Wednesday.
In perfect conditions I.C.
got straight into their stride
from the kick off, and they
scored almost immediately
through Keith Heaton on
the left wing after a multi-
handling move. Bob Pine
converted from the touch
line. Then came an ava-
lanche of tries and points to
put I.C. 21 pts. up after 16
minutes. The whole game
revolved around the domi-
nation of the I.C. hard boys
" up front" who gave the
backs almost immaculate
possession from both set
and loose play.
The ample possession be-
came an embarrassment to
I.C. and by half time one
and all were exhausted with
their own attacking and the
score had only been in-
creased to 27-0. With such
a high score it is impossible
to pick out the individual
scorers, but it was good to
see plenty of tries coming
from the threes.
I.C. started the second
half lethargically (and. stifl
exhausted) and managed to
score only 3 more tries by
full time. It would be
churlish to criticise them for
a weak second half bearing
in mind what they already
had under their belts; suffi-
cient to say it wasn't as good
as the first half.
One must mention the
captain, John Ballard, who
managed three tries, and
once again the pack, who
were magnificent.

L.S.E. 3 I.C. 4
I.C. 1st (XI) (Soccer)
visited L.S.E. on Wednes-
day to complete the first
half of the league pro-
gramme. As three of the
last four games had resulted
in one-all draws it was
hoped that a change of
team formation could pro-
duce a goal-scoring for-
ward line.
In the early stages, the
I.C. defence was rather
uncertain, not surprisingly,
perhaps, due to the new
formation, and the L.S.E.
forwards were quick to ex-
ploit this and take an early
lead. The I.C. X I soon
drew level, however, with a
fine goal from D. King, but
slack defensive covering let
in L.S.E. for their second
goal. By this time the mid-
field players were taking
control and the L.S.E. de-
fence was put under some
pressure, so that T. M c -
Cardle was able to take
advantage of a defensive
error and equalise. Shortly
before a half-time, I.C. were
awarded a penalty and R.
Dixon made no mistake.
The game continued in the
same pattern in the second
half with the I.C. defence
not playing as well as usual,
but managing to contain the
L.S.E. forwards. I.C. used
the wind to their advantage
and T. McCardle picked up a
long clearance from M .
Davies, in goal, to score a
fourth goal. About a quar-
ter of an hour from time,
L.S.E. scored while the I.C.
goalkeeper was injured but
they never looked as though
they would gain control and
I.C. were quite content to
play defensively until the
final whistle.

Mines 3. Guilds 8
Guilds began their de-
fence of the Technicians
Cup with a very comfort-
able win over Mines. After
five minutes, Wallace
opened the scoring for
Guilds with a penalty, and
continuous Guilds pressure
resulted, in Squire (2) and
McCardle adding further
goals for Guilds before the
interval. Moon scored
Mines solitary goal in the
first half, after some slack-
ness in the Guilds defence.
Guilds not unnaturally,
took things easier in the
second half. McCardle.
Keir and Coldwell adding
further goals for them.
Moon for Mines completed
a personal hat-trick to make
the final score: Guilds 8,
Mines 3. This was a good
display by Guilds, although
R.C.S. should prove
tougher opposition.

HOCKEY
U.L.U. Cup l?t round
I.C. 6 : Bedford College 0
I.C. fielded a strong side
against Bedford last Wed-
nesday, with very positive
results. After 5 minutes I.C.
opened the scoring with a
clever goal by Tasney, which
was immediately followed
by a rocket of a goal after a
short corner from Ray
Phillips.
The final goal of the first
half was scored from the
penalty spot after I.C's
right winger had been rugby
tackled in the goal mouth.
I.C.'s defence was never
in any difficulty and with
extra support from the half
backs I.C.'s forwards could
hardly fail to score more
goals. The fourth came
after a fine solo effort by
Tasney, who was having a
fine game at inside right.
The service from both win-
gers was first class and more
goals might have been
scored if their crosses had
been better utilised by the
3 inside forwards.
However more goals came
for I.C. following a mel6e in
the Bedford goalmouth;
Sargeant scored from close
in. The final goal came
after some fine work down
the right side of the field.
Ian Tasney deservedly
scored his 3rd and I.C.'s
6th goal.
So I.C. go into the second
round to play as yet un-
known opponents in early
December.
T E A M : Townsey, Burtt,
Comyn, Sargeant, Hill,
Phillips, Manning, Tasney,
Pratt, Ringrose and Rodger.
NARROW WIN
IN R E G A T T A
The winter term is always
one for hard work, cold
weather and very gradual
improvement for the Boat
Club, interspersed with only
one or two regattas to
brighten it up. Saturday,
16th November was one of
these occasions and the club
entered the event of Junior
Lightweight Eights in the
Regatta organised by Vesta
Rowing Club. The crew
consisted mainly of oars-
men who began rowing
with I.C.B.C. two years
ago, and in practise pro-
mised to do well in their
races.
Four crews had entered
altogether, ours being
drawn against Bedford
Modern School, and the
others were City University,
and Stratford-upon-Avon
Rowing Club. The com-
petition proved better than
expected and although our
crew led Bedford from start
to finish, they were pressed
hard by a typically tena-
cious schoolboy crew and
won by | length. The final
proved even more difficult
and in this race I.C. were
led by Stratford for most of
the race and were trailing
by a whole length at one
stage. However, it was our
turn to fight back and with
some good steering by Beck
over our home course—•
almost the same as. that
used for the Lowry race
—the crew drew up level
with 20 strokes to go ,and
managed to win by 3 feet.,'
In the past three years,
the Eoat Club has always
had difficulty in winning
Open Eights events and it is
hoped that this victory will
be the beginning of a series
of wins this year in eights.
On Saturday is the Univer-
sity of London Winter
VIIIs regatta, in which four
crews from the boat club
will be competing and it'
should prove a profitable
day's racing.
