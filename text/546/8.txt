THE MICROCOMPUTER C L U B
• The Microcomputer Club was founded
bu a ornun of neoole who felt that the
Imperial College of Science and Tech-
nology should give its members access to
what all the pupils call "New Technology"
without having to fork out the £200
required to get a decent micro up and
running.
The Club is now the proud owner of a
complete system, with eight inch disks
and a printer and a paper tape reader-
punch. So we have achieved our initial
objective, there is a micro which any
member of College may use. The Club
also arranges talks, demonstrations and
other events.
O n Wednesday of this week we held an
Open Day, when many members of the
club displayed their m i c r o p r o c e s s o r
systems. We were amazed by the number
of people who turned up (including the
Rector who is our H o n Pres) which
prompted our sec to say, "Which just
goes to show that there are many more
people interested in micros than most
people think — including us!"
At the show there were about ten or
twelve microprocessors on display, most
of them running games programs, but one
was playing music — a Mk 14 and the
Club's system was doing nothing, because
nobody's yet written any programs for it.
So, if you spend 50p per day on Space
Invaders then a compukit 101 is for you —
there was one micro which was running
Space Invaders from 1:00pm to 3:00pm
almost without a break.
O n Tuesday we had a talk on Forth by
the owner of the U K copywrite on that
language. The demonstration was very
impressive in that it convinced the Club,
who had previously felt that it was a nice idea
but not worth worrying about, but now most
of us are dying to get the language on to
our systems. The main reason for this, I
think, is the versitility of. Forth, which you
can redefine as you go along, so if you
find y o u d o n ' t want a s q u a r e root
function, but you do want an x — x + 7x
function you can do it!
O n Tuesday we are having a demon-
stration of the S o r c e r e r by Miss V
Downes. who received the machine for
P C W (one of the big two micro magazines;.
O n Tuesday 11th March David Hebditch,
also of P C W will be giving a talk and a demo
of his Personal Computer Network — a
system which allows c o m m u n i c a t i o n
between micros, via the phone.
So if you are interested in micros come to
Miss Downes' talk.

PS: If you get the chance, go to the
'Challenge Of The Chip' exhibition at the
Science Museum — it's very good.

Campaign For Real Food
" O u r much loved catering manager"
to q u o t e The News Quiz, has after
much stalling and putting off of dates,
agreed to try to make some improve-
ments to his food.
T h e first attempt will be between
Monday 10th March and Friday 14th
w h e n he w i l l a t t e m p t to p r o d u c e
v e g e t a r i a n m e a l s in the S h e r f i e l d
Refectory. If this is a success (ie well
supported by lots of students eating
them), he may be persuaded to go on
to make other changes. However, if it
fails, due to lack of support, he will
not.
T h e last time that he tried this it
failed, — and that was in 1950. So, if
y o u w a n t a n o t h e r t h i r t y y e a r s of
indigestible, extortionate meals, just
ignore the Sherfield Refectory during
the week of March.

further details on facing page). During the
programme they will be exclusively announcing a
competition which will take place during the Gig,

latest record, including free picture disc.
Do You Like to Funk?
(or do you just want to Get Down?)
It's a common misconception around College
that all students like Rock Music etc. (often
called 'Student Music'); this, Iwould like to
reveal, is quite untrue. I am an exeption to this
statement 'cos I prefer Disco musicfShock,
Horror!) and I'm sure that there are many other
students out there in Listener Land who also
prefer disco music. So all you Funky Freakers
can tune in to 301m (999kHz) every Thursday at
6pm for an hour of "The best of all that's good
in music".
I usually play some of the week's new disco
releases, the records that are doing well in the
charts, and one or two oldies.
At 6.20 a guest D.J. comes in from Funky
Fulham with his Floor Fillers - the records that are
good for dancing to in the Discos.
So join me every Thursday at six.
