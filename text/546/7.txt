The Great Imperial R a g Race is about
to be set i n m o t i o n ; at 2 : 0 0 p m t h i s
afternoon hordes of competitors will be
setting forth armed with thousands of Rag
M a g s to sell around the country. T h e
finish of the race is at 10:30 o n S u n d a y in
the U n i o n B a r , s o if y o u want to see h o w
people have got o n then be there to
welcome them back. W e are hoping at
least to break even with the R a g M a g this

profit, as t h e r e is s o m e d o u b t as t o
w h e t h e r t h e C o l l e g e will a l l o w u s t o
produce o n e next time after the fuss
there was « t the beginning of the year.
This R a g M a g in particular has caused a
g r e a t d e a l o f c o n t r o v e r s y , b u t t h e
production of some sort of magazine is
important to publicise Imperial College
Rag around the country as a n active
institution, s o we need to keep it going.
T h e Deaf Children's Party will be held

T H E F I E L D C U P 1980
(a sober report)
T h e F i e l d C u p , a t r e a s u r e h u n t
involving teams of five or more solving
cryptic clues leading to ten pubs in a n d
a r o u n d S o u t h K e n s i n g t o n , a d d i t i o n a l
points being scored for alcholic drinks
imbibed.
The teams were assembled; w h o were
the favourites? Previous competitions h a d
shown A R B S to be strong contenders,
but could anyone beat the experienced
c a m p a i g n e r s O ' B o y l e / B r a i n / L e d w o l d /
T e u t o n / T u r n - - combination (rumoured to
be entering as the Teetotal team — a .
joke, surely?). T h e rules, a list of pubs in
the area, a list of treasure, a n d the first
clue was handed out to the teams by the
event's organiser, N a b Kalsi, a n d the
event began, with teams steadily rushing
off to their first p u b as their clue was
solved.
For the next four hours, the teams
w a l k e d , r a n , a n d c r a w l e d r o u n d t h e
district, drinking as m u c h as possible
(with the exception of the n o w almost-
teetotal team) a n d desperately searching
for valuable items of treasure; two pounds
of c o o k e d s p a g h e t t i , a c a r t y r e , a n
inflatable rubber person, a n d a pair of
false teeth (to name but a few). Before
long, some teams realised that there'd
b e e n a c o c k - u p s o m e w h e r e ; t h e y
s h o u l d n ' t be r e c e i v i n g t h e s a m e c l u e
twice, sending them back to a previous
pub! Still, it just went to prove the o l d
saying that Guilds couldn't organise a
piss-up in a brewery, never mind a p u b
crawl!*
F r o m 1 0 : 3 0 p m o n w a r d s , t h e t e a m s
assembled in the Lower Lounge, which
had not witnessed such carnage since the
previous year. People fought for treasure,
trampling o n top of their less fortunate
comrades w h o h a d collapsed o n the floor
in a pile of chunder. Even one of the
m a r s h a l s h a d b e c o m e s u f f i c i e n t l y
inebriated to be able to trip over and cut
his eye without appearing to notice it.

home, o r alternatively crashed out where
they collapsed.
The result, announced the following

points/head); Second, Barry's Boot B o y s
(with 204.7 points/head); Third, Harry's
