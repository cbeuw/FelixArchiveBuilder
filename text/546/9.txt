I suppose it is just possible that is has
escaped your notice that there is an IC
E N T S gig this coming Sunday (2nd March).
Albertos Y Los Trios Paranois, in case
you didn't know, have changed their
name to the Charlie Parkas. This, I gather
is partly due to the death of one member
and the leaving of another, and also due
to a change in musical direction. Well, I
don't know about that, but I do know
that they have always been great to listen
to and expert satirists. In fact their satire
transcends the raw material itself, they
have been known to precede fashion and
they were making punks look silly before
anyone had heard of the Sex Pistols.
Their stage show, Snuff Rock, featuring
Norman Sleak, produced what must go
down in history as the best punk EP ever
made: Snuff Rock. This featured one
t r a c k of c o m p l e t e l y m i n d b o g g l i n g
excellence Kill. One minute and twenty-
nine seconds of pure T N T , it stands as
the ultimate punk song, even though it is
a pisstake. "I'm gonna cut me liver out
and shove it in your face", sums it up
fairly well, although it is impossible to
describe listening to it properly without
resorting to hitting oneself on the head
with a large and heavy piece six inches of
Kings Road punk skin.
Punk, however, is now passe and so
these fun-filled fellows have turned their
attention to Mod.
This tour, the 'March Of The Slobs'
tour is obviously a poke at the much-
publicised Mod revival, and their new
single Robin Hood, has once again proved
they can hit the mark better than anyone.
After all, we've had ska versions of old
songs like Tears Of A Clown so why not
Robin Hood?
I leave it to your imagination to what it
sounds like, although you can hear it on
the radio if you know when to listen, or
else I'm certain you'll get a much better
impression if you see it done live, this
Sunday, Imperial College, Great Hall. Get
your tickets now boys and girls, or you'll
be sorry.
Of course there is one other good
reason for going to Sunday's concert, the
wonderful scintillating support group.

I refer of course to the S M I R K S . Y e s ,
this little-known Manchester band have
had no less than four singles, all highly
r a t e d by J o h n P e e l , a n d t w o of t h e m
N M E singles of the week. T h e y have been
signed to Beserkely (Johnathan Richman's
l a b e l ) , a n d V i r g i n , a n d y e t s t i l l t h e
s u c c e s s , fame a n d g l o r y t h e y d e s e r v e
eludes them. W e the converted therefore
feel obliged to tell you, the world, what
you're missing.
T h e b a n d ' s d o w n - t o - e a r t h s t y l e of
humour shows through in most of their
s o n g s , a n d t h e y h a v e p r o v e d t h e i r
flexibility many times, playing blues, pop,
reggae and rock with equal ease and flair.
Their first and probably most well-known
single w a s O K UK, a n u n l i k e l y s o n g
written in praise of this country over s u c h
fashionable places as California, viz:
"California heartache gets on my wick,
And the kids that sing about it make me
sick,
I'm OK where I am,
OK OK"
The vocals are flawless and handled
mainly by S i m o n Milner, the lead singer.
B a c k e d by the rest of the group it c o m e s
out sounding fresh and vibrant, c o m b i n e d
w i t h the w i t t y s t y l e it has t h a t e x t r a
something that should spell success in
eight foot letters. A l m o s t everyone I k n o w
who has ever seen them live has become
an ardent fan (I've seen them three times
in L o n d o n alone), so my advice to y o u is
don't miss them or you'll miss out. They'll
be very big one day soon and you'll love
to say " O h yes they played at my college
once before they were famous!"

LP REVIEW
Group 8 of the Periodic Table
lives on, due to — Various
Artists — Metal for Muthas —
EMI E M C 3318
Not that you really need the catalogue
number, as this L P is destined for the
charts. A compilation of new and not easily
available material compiled by EMI's A & R
boffin, Ashley Goodall, with the aid of Heavy
Metal soundhouse DJ, Neal K a y , who
writes the eloquent sleeve notes, which is
fitting since he is partly responsible for the
success of Praying Mantis and Iron Maiden,
the latter contributing the first track,
Sanctuary. A n excellent start this proves to
be; quick, powerful and with effective guitar
breaks and those contrasts in volume that
send a shiver down your spine. Paul
Di'Anno's vocals elevate the standard of the
song e n o r m o u s l y . It is f o l l o w e d by
Sledgehammers's Sledgehammer, the most
commercial of the songs, since it has a tune
which refuses to leave your head. T h e E F
Band's Fighting For Rock And Roll, starts
promisingly and develops into a song that
seems too fast. Productionwise the guitar
sounds too distant, and the track has an
unwelcome continental feel to it. T o a d the
W e t S p r o c k e t ' s Blues In A, would have been
better suited to an Elton J o h n L P . It is
l e t h a r g i c a n d u n i n s p i r i n g a l t h o u g h
competently performed. This is more than
made up for by Praying Mantis' Captured
City. Mantis were in the shadow of Iron
M a i d e n , and although less experienced, are
just as promising. T h e track is equippped
with devastating harmonies; not an amp
blower, but one of the best tracks on the L P .
T h e vocal accent is delightful, especially on
the w o r d "city". Lyrically meaningful, it is
the most refined track on the L P , and also
the longest, but still not long enough.
Side two begins with Fight Back, by Ethel
the F r o g , and a n accent problem, or is it the
recording? A good song, but not loud
e n o u g h . A s p o o k y s t a r t , c o u r t e s y of
Angelwitch introduces, Baphomet, a Black
Sabbathy song, pretty good all the same.
Back to the professionals, the next three
tracks make the album a 4 V 2 starrer (out of
5). Iron Maiden's Wrathchild, is solid class,
and the band's confidence overflows.
T h e n , a piano intro, and the sound of
Radio 2 builds up to Samson's Tomorrow
Or Yesterday. Cultured but still heavy, the
song shows signs of being structured, and
the formula works well. T h e last, and best
track is Nutz's Boot/iggers, Spanish guitar
type solo a la V a n Halen, then into a sheet of
sound. Vocals are vaguely reminscent of the
late B o n Scott, the feeling put into the word,
"bootligger" is perfect. Professional and an
excellent curtain closer.
The record is available at the m a x i m u m
price of £3.99, and on offer goes as low as
£2.99, and with every playing gets better.
