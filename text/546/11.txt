CHESS: IC1 vs Centymca
With only one win in five matches
this season, IC1 needed a good result
against Centymca, last year's champi-
ons, to keep clear of the regulation
z o n e . H o w e v e r , ouf c h a n c e s of
winning looked slight as the opposition
heavily outgraded us on most of the
eight boards.
Usually chess matches are rather
slow (and boring?) affairs lasting well
over three hours, so it was a bit- of a
sensation w h e n two of the g a m e s
finished within twenty minutes. Pete
Anderson, on board three, forsaking
his favourite Q u e e n - P a w n o p e n i n g ,
lost a six move g a m e in just ten
minutes(!) while Julian Bacon took
j u s t t w i c e as l o n g to c r u s h h i s
b e m u s e d o p p o n e n t . Unfortunately
normality returned and the prospect of
an early exodus to the Union Bar
faded as the next game did not finish
for another two hours.
From very early on, it was evident
that Centymca were much stronger on
the top boards but the games were
more evenly matched lower down. O n
board two, J o n Freeman quickly lost a
pawn and was struggling from then on
while Phil Maguire, on the top board,
played passively in the opening and
soon had a difficult position. Things
were going much better on the bottom
boards; on board seven, Jitesh Gajjar
obtained a strong position from the
opening and Chris Callow, on board
eight, was able to snatch the initiative
with a strong Kingside attack. Brian
Tang produced a bold piece sacrifice,
on board four, and looked set for a
good win but Bob Coles struggled
against an unusual opening set-up
and was soon in trouble.
J i t e s h d u l y p r e s s e d h o m e h i s
a d v a n t a g e a n d s o o n f o r c e d his
o p p o n e n t to resign. C h r i s C a l l o w
smashed open his opponent's King-
s i d e with a well c a l c u l a t e d R o o k
sacrifice leaving himself with an easy
win. This gave IC a 3-1 lead but J o n
and Bob soon put paid to that; J o n
decided that losing one pawn wasn't
bad enough and proceeded to lose
another three, leaving him four pawns
down in a lost end game. O n four,
Bob never recovered from his poor
opening play and was well beaten.
This left the score level at 3-3 with
two games unfinished. Brian Tang,
unfortunately, failed to convert his
early advantage and had to be content
with a draw. Thus the IC Captain now
needs to draw his game to save the
match. He missed an easy drawing
line but h a s a d j o u r n e d in o n l y a
slightly inferior position w h i c h he
should be able to hold. So hopefully,
the match shold finish as a 4-4 draw
giving IC a well deserved half point.
T e a m : P M a g u i r e , J F r e e m a n , P
Anderson, B Tang, R Coles, J Bacon,
J Gajjar and C T Callow.

IC SAILING
IC Sailing Club entered two teams
in the Castaways C u p this weekend, in
which London Colleges and Hospitals
competed. Both teams were undefeated
against the other nine teams and IC A
team beat IC B team in the preliminary
league. Sunday saw a wet, cold day with
a slight breeze a n d both IC teams
qualifying for the final. Two races were
held; the first being won by IC B team
h o l d i n g s e c o n d , t h i r d a n d f o r t h
positions and with two and a half penalty
points against IC A. In the second race,
IC A team took first, second and third
positions on the line, but two incidents
involving Alan Beany and Dave Derby,
a n d A l a n B e a n y a n d Ian R o b s o n
occured, resulting in two protests. A
committee was set up and in its first
hearing disqualified both Alan Beany
and Dave D e r b y and in its s e c o n d
disqualified Ian Robson. Thus after an
afternoon of drama, IC B team took the
honours by three points.
A t e a m : D D e r b y , D C u l s h a w , I
Robson, G Titmus, and N Ajderian.
B team: J Williams, A Beany, C Lewis,
A Turnbull/C Jaffey, J Baxter and K
Andrews.
BALDWIN HAT TRCK
CLINCHES IT FOR IC
After George Adach's failure to sign
Kevin K e e g a n and the previous 9-1
defeat by Guys Hospital left the sixths
morale at a low ebb. With the absence
of s u c h h o u s e h o l d n a m e s as Dave
Bradley, Ismael Sola, Steve Davies and
Gary Slater it looked as though the
sixths would be left to scrape up a
team again. In fact this was not the
case, as five ' i m p o r t e d superstars'
from other teams came to the rescue
and played an invaluable part in IC's
win.
The game was even to begin with
a n d both s i d e s c r e a t e d s o m e half
c h a n c e s . T h e n , from Pete C u r z o n ' s
pin-pointed corner a lovely header by
Mark Clegg put IC into the lead. This
goal provoked some consistent attack-
ing football from St Georges which
was rebuffed by IC's solid defence and
good goalkeeping by Richard Rijnbeek.
IC then took the initiative and after a
period of constant pressure, Sean Coyle
hassled a defender so that he misjudged
his back pass and the ever alert Ken
Baldwin was on hand to score. Ken
Baldwin pounced a few minutes later
when the St Georges' goalkeeper failed
to hold a shot. Ken's hat trick soon
followed from a particularly good IC
move.
In the second half Nigel Audin (the
first half referee) replaced Ken Baldwin
who had an ankle injury. From the start
of this half, St Georges piled on the
pressure and scored when a melee in the
goalmouth resulted in George Adach
appearing to kick the ball into his own
net, however, this was later d e n i e d
(mainly by G e o r g e ) . He later m a d e
amends for this by kicking the ball off
the line when a goal looked certain.
D u r i n g this p e r i o d of p r e s s u r e IC
c o u n t e r - a t t a c k e d a n d S e a n C o y l e
scored a superb solo goal. St Georges
soon scored again when a back-pass
went astray but IC were never in danger
of conceding any more.
Team: G Adach (Capt), R Rijnbeek, P
C u r z o n , L i a m , P G a h i l , S C o y l e , D
Timbler, Bob, D Kelly, M Clegg and K
Baldwin (N Audin).
TABLE TENNIS
Last week was undeniably the nadir
of the s e a s o n (that m e a n s b o t t o m ,
b u n k h e a d s ! ) for the firsts. S t a n d i n g
imperiously atop division four (with
ten points clear) and favourites for the
Minor League Knock-Out C u p , they
met F u l h a m 4, a t e a m w h i c h t h e
f o u r t h s h a d d e f e a t e d 6-3 o n l y a
fortnight ago. What happened? I'm still
asking that myself. Actually, it was 5-
4 the wrong way, out of the cup, and
the over confident firsts (never short
of my praises all season), played some
of the slackest, least aggressive table
tennis ever seen since the last time I
played!
IC 4 vs S A I N S B U R Y 2: 9-0
An excellent win over the second
placed division 6a side, putting us into
that spot — divisional play-off here we
come.
IC 4 vs CITY UNIV: 7-2
The home defeat of last term (due to
my b r i l l i a n t t e a m s e l e c t i o n ? ) w a s
finally avenged, but I tried hard to give
them a double over us. Lars and Max
won three sets each, I lost two (I had
a cold).
The thirds annihilated (I like these
powerful expressive words, let's use
another one . . . ) nay, conquered yet
another measly obstacle to their cup
hopes, Gainsford 4 by 9-0. Truck on!
Earlier, both the seconds and firsts
had also won their most recent league
matches (God knows how the firsts
won).
The club will soon, ie this team, be
h o l d i n g e l e c t i o n s f o r n e x t y e a r ' s
officials, ancf don't forget that we have
E T T A p r o f e s s i o n a l c o a c h i n g every
Monday between 7:00pm and 9:00pm
in the table tennis room. Approximate
cost fifty pence.
Finally this week, a mention of the
U L U table tennis team. I don't normally
mention them, in fact never, because for
at least the last two years they've
kidnapped our best players — hence^we
struggle along in divs four, five and six;
but at least with two thirds IC players,
their first team is second in the Central
League — division one; pretty smart,
huh?
