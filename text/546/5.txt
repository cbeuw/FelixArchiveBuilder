Tuesday saw the publication of the report of
the working party on medical and dental
teaching resources. The working party, chaired
by the Lord Flowers, Rector of Imperial
College, recommends that the thirty-four
separate medical and teaching institutions in
London should be regrouped into six new
schools of medicine and dentistry.
This would involve closing Westminster
Hospital medical school and several other
London medical institutes. The Editor of FELIX
interviewed two third year medical students
from Westminster who had just returned from
a demonstration outside the University of
London.
They had been shouting slogans: "Some
Flowers smell but this one stinks", etc. Both
BBC and ITN gave extensive coverage to the
Lord Flowers press conference and the
medical student demonstrations. An interview
with the Lord Flowers was the lead item on the
BBC 5:40 news. The nurses at St Stephen's
gave a cool response to the Lord Flowers'
statement, "Although the hospitals don't like
the way the cutbacks affect their backyard . . .
they will accept it." The nurses resolved not to
allow the report to be easily accepted.
The Dean of Westminster, Dr John Wyman,
has told the medical students that "the hands
of the authorities at Westminster are tied, but
the students have the opportunity to be free to
protest." The Westminster Medical School

W e r e y o u one of the two people w h o were needed to make last
Tuesday's E G M quorate? I had a valid excuse, but four thousand
other students at I C with no physical disabilities could have made
it to the G r e a t Hall. W h y don't y o u make an effort to c o m e to

held at next Thursday's U G M in the G r e a t Hall. This popular
event combines humour with the more serious business of leaving
candidates telling y o u about their good points.

Certain students at I C have decided that they fancy a year off

THE L O R D FLOWERS ANGERS
MEDICAL STUDENTS
Students' Union have set up a committee to
oppose the recommendations. The group
called FLAC (rumoured to stand for Flowers
Liquidation Action Committee) will voice
opposition and organise demonstrations over
â€¢the next few months.
The arguments for keeping Westminster
Teaching Hospital alive is that it has the
highest first time pass rate and unmatched
honours results. The students argued that the
cost of training a doctor at Westminster is less
than at most teaching establishments in
London. One argument for closing the hospital
was that it was small. However, the medical
students commented that it was not that small
(seventh largest out of twelve), but it was cost
effective.
"The patients will suffer." Westminster's
strong points are its radiotherapy unit, which
consultants have spent years to establish. Also,
Westminster is reknown for its specialist work
with bone marrow as well as having an
important children's section. "Westminster has
a tradition that has developed over one
hundred and fifty years. It can't be recreated or
amalgamated."
The students blamed the authorities for
overspending their budget on two new
hospitals. They said it would cost twenty
million pounds to transfer departments to St
Thomas' and to carry that out would be like
"making a first division team play with the
fourth division's equipment . . . Tommies just
haven't got it."
