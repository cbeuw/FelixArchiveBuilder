N E W S IN BRIEF
TREES AND PARKING
SPACES
More trees are to be planted in
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e R o a d . T h e
Rector gave his permission so as to
further improve the visual beauty
of College.
The trees will be at the expense
of five or so parking spaces. For
the mean time these permit holders
will be able to use the visitor's car
park and after this year these
spaces will be lost.
Roger Stotesbury adds: " T h e
present move must be seen in
relation to the past. The patch of
grass in front of Old Chemistry is
grass because the Rector once
said, "Put grass there". At the time
of the rebuilding of College it. was
suggested by some that underground
car parks be built. Furthermore, it is
also said that the College had the
option of purchasing the car parking
space under the Albert Hall."
T h e R e c t o r ' s p o l i c y of not
subsidising 'non-academic' services
suggest changes may be made to
present parking arrangements.
BOOKSHOP PROFITS
The Union is to continue to make
a profit out of the Bookshop. A
motion at Monday's Council calling
for the current profit to be claimed
on the per capita was defeated.
Malcom Brain, who proposed the
motion, suggested that the prices
of staionery should be reduced as
the Bookshop was the only 'service'
in College to make a profit. The
majority of Council felt that to reduce
the profit, for the one year that we *
were on the per capita system would
be foolhardy move.
WEIGHT TRAINING
A new ten station multigym has
been bought (at great expense) and
is now installed in the S p o r t s
Centre. The equipment is for use
by any member of I C U at a cost of
15p per session (free for Weights
Club members). For the moment,
clubs will not be allowed to book
the multigy. Please read the safety
rules on tfie wall chart in the
Sports Centre before using the
equipment.
Thanks must go to Chris Fox,
Malcolm Brain and Steve Gunn for
their efforts in o b t a i n i n g the
necessary finance and pushing the
p r o j e c t t h r o u g h t h e v a r i o u s
meetings.

C r o s s , S u t h e r l a n d and several

OPENING FOR SPORTS
CENTRE
It was proposed at the Athletic
Clubs Committee that the Sports
Centre in Prince's Gardens should
be open on Sundays for use by
students and staff. Before this idea
goes any further, it is essential that
A C C knows how many people are
definitely interested in making use
of this extension of the facilities;
therefore a petition will be posted
in all the halls, the J C R and in the
Union Lower Lounge.
MICRO PROCESSORS
Professor John Albery's working
p a r t y , set up to a s s e s s the
College's position in relation to the
industrial applications of micropro-
cessors, has r e c o m m e n d e d the
creation of a special departmental
and administrative machinery to
foster and coordinate work in the
field of microprocessors. Further, it
says, a teaching unit, funded by a
special U G C earmarked grant,
should come into being.
At present only Physics and Elec
Eng students receive micropro-
cessor education.
JUBILEE LECTURE
Lord Denning will give the fourth
Jubilee lecture, entitled Science
Under Scrutiny on Thursday 13th
March. As personal publicity for

also batteries, combs, razor blades,
toothbrushes and a large selection
of other useful items!
"Prices are as competitve as we
can reasonably make them, and
whenever possible, goods will be
sold at 'on special offer' prices.
" U n d o u b t e d l y the s h o p

staff and students, but to improve
its viability, we need to improve
