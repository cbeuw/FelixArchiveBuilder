Dear Colin
We are disgusted with the
attitude of most IC students,
who as far as we can make out
are a load of hypocritical
w?????s. A few people give up a
lot of their time to organise
entertainment for these people
who seem to expect it as their
G o d given right to have it. Then
don't bother to turn up on the
night to experience it before
passing judgment.
For instance, take last week's
concert by Berlin in the Concert
Hall: a lot of effort and time went
into putting on the show; not
only on the Friday afternoon and
evening, but also through the
preceding weeks to get all the
bureaucracy, etc, in order. Is not
a kick in the c???h. This is not as
if you are cramped in a sweaty
sleazy dung heap like Nashville
or Marquee (where you also get
ripped ott tor drinks even worse
than Mooney).
By the way, the band played
excellently and everyone really
enjoyed themselves; I predict
that they will be a great success,
as in the general tradition of
bands who have played in the
Concert Hall (Def Leppard, Jane
Aire, Girlschool, After The Fire,
999, X T C , Horslips, Burlesque,
Enid (who have played here
twice), to name but a few.
You P?r? ??r???s are always
asking for more bands, but
what you mean is 'well known'
bands like Genesis, Yes, Led
Zeppelin, etc; Well, face up to the
facts, in London they prefer/no,
require to play the larger halls...
Wembley, Hammy Odeon, Earl's
Court, because the promoter
has to cover his costs. Imagine
putting on a band who need to fill
out the Odeon at £7.00 a ticket to
cover costs being put on in the
Great Hall — the costs would be
over £20.00 a ticket... you seem
to have enough trouble forking
out £1.00, let alone £20.00!
If for a change, you come
up with some constructive,
r a t h e r t h a n d e s t r u c t i v e ,
criticism, we will be more than
happy to listen and possibly act
upon your suggestions.
Never was so much done by so
few for so many and gone
unappreciated.
Yours sincerely

Dear Colin
One of our (Islamic) society
members noticed the use of
'God, Allah, Mao, Buddha' in
the table tennis a r t i c l e in
F E L I X (issue 544). I want to
point out two points. Firstly,
Allah is an A r a b i c w o r d Ali-Tah
and is the name given to the
only G o d we believe exists and
secondly, we do not associate
with Allah any other G o d ; as
this forms one of the foremost
principles in our religion — ie,
the Oneness of G o d .
O u r religion teaches that we
be t o l e r a n t to all o t h e r s , as
long as they do not misrepresent
I s l a m or try to d e s t o r y it. I
suggest that the use of Islamic
terms (widely misrepresented in
national newspapers) be limited
to those who will not offend our
p r i n c i p l e s ( i n t e n t i o n a l l y o r
unintentionally).

The Peace of God be upon
those who follow the correct
path.
Dear Roger
Below is a letter I have sent
to Paul Segal, News Editor of
London Student newspaper,
with reference to an incorrect
story carried by them on
Wednesday.
Dear Paul
I was interested to read in
this week's London Student
that a motion calling for a
referendum on N U S affiliation,
proposed by myself as "one of
the two vice presidents at
I m p e r i a l " , was passed at a
Union meeting on Tuesday.
Unfortunately, there appear
to be some factual inaccuracies
in this report which I would like
to correct.
(i) Imperial has three vice
presidents.
(ii) I am not one of them.
(iii) The motion on N U S was
proposed by Chris Webb and
seconded by myself.
(iv) T H A T T H E M E E T I N G O N
T U E S D A Y W A S D E E M E D
I N Q U O R A T E B E F O R E A N Y
V O T E C O U L D B E T A K E N .
As I am sure you are aware,
this is not the first time Imperial
has been misreported in London
Student. You may also rem-
ember that last term we were
the first college to go into
occupation in protest at the
proposed increases in overseas
s t u d e n t s tuitiion fees, but
Sennet (as you then were) did
not appear to consider this to
be of sufficient importance to
even mention it.
I would also like to ask how
it is possible for London Student
to send a reporter to our Union
Meeting on Tuesday (which
ended up at 1:30pm) and have an
a r t i c l e w r i t t e n , t y p e s e t a n d
pasted up, and the whole paper
printed, collated, and distributed
in time for me to be shown one at
7:00pm O N T H E S A M E D A Y ?
T o produce and distribute a
paper reporting an event which
occurred a mere five and a half
hours previously is a staggering
feat which you are to be congrat-
ulated on.
Perhaps it would in addition be
possible for things to be correctly
reported in future?
Y o u r s sincerely
M a l c o l m Brain

Dear Colin
The article about the Twenty-
F o u r H o u r Pedal C a r Race at
Bristol in F E L I X 545 so incensed
me by its total bias to C & G that I
have decided to write this letter.
Rather than giving my immediate
reaction, I have decided to wait
until the official results have been
received from Bristol so that I
may give a balanced account of
the event.
T o begin with, four teams
were entered by I C . T w o each
from R S M and C & G , a mens and
ladies team in each case. During
the race itself all teams suffered
greatly from breakdowns. The
R S M cars both suffered frac-
tured cranks, the men's steering
broke twice, punctures were
incurrred on both cars and the
ladies car suffered a fracture of
its main feature — this resulting
in a pit-stop for repairs of three
and three quarter hours. C e r -
tainly Guilds had problems too;
with the pedals on the mens' car
and the steering of the ladies' car;
but to say that this cost them the
race was ludicrous. There was
never any question of the team
beating Rolls-Royce C o v e n t r y
and nor would there have been if
t h e c a r h a d b e e n w o r k i n g
perfectly. In past years, all cars
have run without problems (as I
k n o w from personal experience)
and although Guilds have had a
m u c h better position, they still
have c o m e nowhere near R-R.
Guilds ladies did pedal magnif-
icently. They had problems with
t h e c a r a n d t h r o u g h s h e e r
determination came through to
win the title. I would point out
t h a t i n a l l p r e v i o u s l a d i e s
competitions Mines have w o n
the title and should the car have
not required extensive repairs
I'm sure the R S M would have
g i v e n G u i l d s a r u n for t h e i r
money — though I feel bound to
say I think Guilds ladies would
still have won. Mines ladies made
the very best of a bad job (my
fault) and considering the very
great problems they encoun-
tered, performed very respect-
ably (Bristol's comments — not
mine). The final results from
Bristol were:
Mines A (men): 897 (20th)
Mines B (ladies) 563 (33rd)
Guilds A (men) 737 (30th)
Guilds B (ladies) 892 (21st)
In c o m p a r i s o n R o l l s - R o y c e
(Coventry) A : 1,233. T h e total
distance covered by all com-
petitors was 8,280 miles (there
were 39 teams in all).
A s you can see the picture is
very different to that painted by
the article in question. I would
have thought that it was the
r e s p o n s i b l i t y of t h e F E L I X
personnel to give a balanced
report by checking out both
sides of a story and to cease this
exasperating bias to C & G .
Y o u r s
Richard Turner
Mines Chief Engineer
Acting Ed's C o m m e n t : It is an
incorrect myth that FELIX
personnel are on hand to cover
all events. FELIX relies on
articles from you, the students. It
is not just here fora few to learn
the skills of journalism. Hence,
Mr Turner, it would have been
better for you to write this
information, which we are
grateful for, last week. A Guilds'
person did and I accept that the
article was slanted towards
Guilds. The Bristol Pedal Car
Race was a great triumph for the
C&G Ladies' team and so was
right to get full recognition in
FELIX.
