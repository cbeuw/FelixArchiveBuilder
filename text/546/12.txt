Imperial College Eights victorious at the Allom Cup Regatta, May 1979.
Continued from front page.
Were you pleased to see it not
discussed at the EGM?
N o ! I could see both sides. In
s o m e ways I felt that a n open
discussion w a s needed o n the
subject, but in other ways I felt if
Boat C l u b were going anyway
then it may have been best, for
o t h e r c l u b s , t o k e e p t h i n g s
quieter.
Would this tour have any
political effect in S Africa?
I'm told not.
Who by?
B o a t C l u b C a p t a i n , w h o
assures m e that this is just a quiet
m a t c h between teams w h o will
meet again at Henley.
So S African teams row at
Henley without opposition?
Y e s , they d o r o w here a n d
they are part of the International
Rower Association.
Does this make rowing different
from other sports?
Y e s , i n some ways. S o u t h
African sport is not part of all
international sports federations
a n d are banned from taking part
in the Olympics.
As an individual, Suki, would'
you as a sportsman play in S'
Africa?
I couldn't I'm coloured.

NUTRITION SURVEY
IC students were asked to take part
in a survey T u e s d a y lunchtime.
Students from the Department of
Nutrition at Queen Elizabeth College
distributed questionnaires in the
library and in the Southside Refec-
tory, as part of a project they are
doing.
The questions they asked per-
tained mostly to the dietary habits of
students in College; such as where
students eat and the reasons for
choosing those places.
The surveyors do not intend using
the results for anything other than
the projects.
