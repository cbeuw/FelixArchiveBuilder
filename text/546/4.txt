T H E RECTOR ATTENDS
COUNCIL
On Monday the Rector attended the
228th meeting of Imperial College
Union Council held in the Concert
Hall. He briefly outlined his opinions
of the future of the College in the face
of the Government expenditure cuts.
Finance
Savings of the of one million pounds
per year, for the next three or four
years were revealed to be necessary.
This, in his opinion, meant that no
area of College life could escape
examination, but academic stan-
dards of primary importance.
Certain departments were singled
out as being already under scrutiny,
in particular, Aeronautical Engin-
eering, C C D , Botany, Zoology and
the Department of the History of
Science and Technology. The
possibilities of combining depart-
ments and changing courses is being
closely examined.
He made one point very obvious;
non-academic matters must be made
to pay their way or they must go. In
particular the halls of residence must
bear the total cost of their operation; •
this means that administrative costs
will be shifted from College onto the
halls account and this, of necessity, |
means a cut in the standards and
level of cleaning.
Savings
Methods of gaining increased income
were also mentioned. For instance
the possibility of gradually removing
the valuable gravel on which the
sports ground at Hariington stand is
being investigated. These would be
minimum disruption to facilities
(using a gradual mining/replacement
system) and a considerable amount
of money could be earnt.
Fees
A matter of considerable importance
to students is the question of
overseas students' fees.
From next October the College
will be charging the recommended
minimum fees to foreign students (ie,
£2,000 pa for Maths and £3,000 pa
otherwise). He stressed that this is a
minimum fee, not the 'full economic'
fee which the Government would like
to see. This would have the effect of
possibly reducing overseas student
numbers drastically in the next few
years. The Rector felt that this was
not at all desireable and added that
there would be absolutely no
question of a hardship fund; students
at present on courses would be
helped up the College's financial
capability, but new students would
be expected to pay their fees or
leave.
No Guarantees
In answer to questions from the
members of Council, the Rector
revealed that he could offer no
guarantees in any field. Everything
would be examined and nothing can
be stated about priorities at present.
He did feel, however, that the
proportion of women at IC should be
increased by attempting to maintain
facilities such as nursery. It was
obvious that he feels more women
should enter the fields of Science and
Engineering.
On the topic of four year engin-
eering courses following the Finni-
ston Report, the Rector stated that
although no decisions were possible
now, he hoped that Imperial could be
one of the few colleges offering the
four year M Eng qualification.
Financial support for these courses
would then be made available by the
Government.
In conclusion, he felt that it was
important that we should maintain
good spirits and make the best of an
apparently bleak few years.
