SPORT AND SOUTH AFRICA
A MORAL DILEMMA
Members of Imperial College Boat Club will be
rowing in South Arica following an invitation which
came after winning the Southern Universities
Regatta. The tour was fully discussed at last
Monday night's Athletics Clubs Committee (ACC)
meeting and was to be discussed at an emergency
motion at Tuesday's Extraordinary Union General
Meeting, but no vote could be taken on the issue
due to quorum being called thirteen minutes into the
meeting.
I C U has no policy against sporting links
with any country. The relevant policy states
that "contacts with individuals and clubs
from any part of the world allow us to
demonstrate the freedom we enjoy at IC
and that such contacts help to break down
prejudices, whilst giving individuals and I C
societies the opportunity to make known
their views and persuade others to their
beliefs". However, the fear that other unions
might break sporting links with us led to
A C C strongly advising the rowing eight to
go under a different dame. This is difficult
under rowing regulations, so it was agreed
that if this was impossible they should go as
i n d i v i d u a l s , or failing t h i s , as I m p e r i a l
College Boat C l u b .
C o u n c i l discussed the issues immediately
after the A C C meeting had finished and
instructed the U n i o n Executive to proposed
a motion to the E G M . The Executive motion
read:
I C U Notes:
1. T h e application of apartheid in South
Africa.
2. T h e intention of Imperial College Boat
C l u b to take a team to compete in a S o u t h
African competition.
I C U Believes:
1. That South Africa must be forced to
remove the application of apartheid from its
constitution and that the only effective way
to do this is to cut all links with South Africa.
2. That in taking a team to South Africa, the
Boat C l u b is in effect showing approval for
the South African system.
I C U Requests:
1. T h a t t h e m e m b e r s of B o a t C l u b
reconsider the implications of their visit and
ask themselves if one sporting fixture can be
played off against the oppression of a whole
race.
2. That the Boat C l u b realise that, should
they decide to continue their visit, they will
be doing so with the strong disapproval of
Imperial College Union.
3. That should they decide to go, the Boat
C l u b make every effort to enter the team
under a name other than that of Imperial
College Boat Club.
T h e E x e c u t i v e m e e t i n g was h e l d at
8:30am on the same day as the E G M , at
which a motion was discussed proposing
that the U n i o n should stop IC Boat C l u b
using the name on any tour to South Africa,
but no agreement could be reached on this
and the motion eventually decided upon
simply stated our disapproval of the tour
and requested Boat C l u b to make every
effort to go under a different name.
A t the E G M a proposal that this motion
be heard first was accepted by a large
m a j o r i t y . H o w e v e r , after the p r o p o s a l
speech "by J o Armitage on behalf of the
Executive, the quorum was challenged.
Only 297 U n i o n members were present
(three less than the required number), and
so the meeting closed.
T w o amendments had been tabled. Steve
W e b b , Captain of the Boat C l u b told F E L I X
he w a s p r e p a r e d t o a c c e p t U n i o n
disapproval, but did not believe that by
going they were showing approval for the
South African political system. H e wanted
to change ' I C U Believes 2' to "the Boat C l u b
may be seen to show support for the South
African system". Secondly, they wanted to
d e l e t e ' I C U B e l i e v e s 1'. A s e c o n d
amendment was also tabled to stop the C l u b
touring, which, if passed, whould have
reversed current U n i o n policy. -
S t e v e W e b b w a s a s k e d by R o g e r
Stotesbury if he was pleased to see the
attention that this tour was getting. H i s reply
was: " N o , but on the other hand, most of
our supporters are College sportsmen, and
only a few, hardliners, are vehemently
opposed to us. I'm sure people in College
don't feel we are doing anything wrong.
"I personally don't support the M o s c o w
' Olympics ban. In M o s c o w the government
is being penalised for government policy; in
connection with South Africa, athletes are
being penalised for government policy. The
government has virtually phased out all legal
apartheid in sports in South Africa."
S o the facts are:
* M e m b e r s of IC Boat C l u b have been
invited to row in S o u t h Africa.
* U n i o n policy has no objection to this;
welcoming it, in fact.
* A C C and I C U Executive have requested
that they make every effort to enter the
team under a name other than that of IC
Boat C l u b .
* I C U Executive requested the U n i o n to
voice its strong disapproval.
* B y publishing this article, sporting links
with other unions may be affected.
O n e person involved in the wrangle at all
levels is Suki Kalirai, the A C C C h a i r m a n .
Last week he came face to face with a moral
dilemma; he talked to Roger Stotesbury
A r e you pleased to see the Boat Club
going to South Africa?
A s A C C C h a i r m a n , I have reservations
about the Boat C l u b going because of the
p o l i t i c a l i m p l i c a t i o n s i n v o l v e d i n the
venture. It is possible that other unions
m a y try a n d s t o p s p o r t i n g l i n k s w i t h
Imperial College as a result of this and
this will be unfair on the rest of the clubs.
This didn't happen with the RSM match
with a SA touring side?
That was because this wasn't a R S M
team, it was a team of individuals who
just happened to be in R S M . Bearing this
in mind, A C C have asked Boat C l u b to
m a k e e v e r y p o s s i b l e e f f o r t to go as
individuals and not as the IC Boat C l u b .
And if they can't?
A C C felt if every possible effort was
made then they should be able to gp as
individuals. But failing this would go as
the Boat C l u b .
