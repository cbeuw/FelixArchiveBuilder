Alcohol - friend or foe?
This week, Nathan Ley goes on to explain about the substance which could very well wreck your life, but will
most probably merely help you to think you’re the most likable person in the room!
...Women - 100 Visions” is

Celebrate the fairer kind in science this term
Walking into Imperial’s Main En-
trance last March felt much like walk-
ing into a modern art gallery. Profes-
sional sleek display panels set up as
a ‘3D walk-through’ art installation
lured visitors to examine it.
On closer inspection, the installa-
tion turned out to be as much about
art as it was about science. The exhi-
bition was part of the ‘100 Women –
100 Visions’ portrait series designed
and commissioned by the student
society Women in Science, Engineer-
ing and Technology (WSET) in order
to raise awareness and attract young
women towards a career in science.
WSET was created in the summer
of 2007 by several of Imperial’s PhD
students and began its activities in the
academic year of 2007/2008. The crea-
tion of the society was the culmina-
tion of a three-year project, funded by
the UK Resource Centre for Women
in SET from 2004-2007, to encour-
age more female students to remain
within SET industries after graduat-
ing. “Through the events we organise
we aim to challenge the preconcep-
tions students have about scientists
and engineers, raise the profile of SET
careers for women, and provide bud-
ding women scientists with visible role
models they can aspire to,” says Eirini
Spentza, one of the society’s founders.
Teamed with couple of science com-
munication and computing students,
WSET is now building a website where
the portrait series originally exhibited
at the College’s Main Entrance could
be viewed digitally by anyone with
access to internet. The website is un-
der construction and will be avail-
able at www.imperialcollegeunion.
org/100women100visions, with a spe-
cial section designed for children.
“We hope the website will give
new graduate students a sense of the
breadth of Imperial’s great community
of women scientists and engineers,
and provide a starting point for mak-
ing contacts and joining networks
around College,” says Ellin Saunders
who coordinated the portrait project.
If you have a passion for photogra-
phy, the new photo competition which
will culminate in a mini exhibition at
the College might be the way to get in-
volved with WSET.
“This coming academic year we plan
to host another photo project for stu-
dents, where the students themselves
will go around campus and take pic-
tures of the everyday life of women at
Imperial as well as capture their own
experiences at the College and share
these with others.” says Ellin.
Other planned activities include
a discussion panel for PhD students
exploring different aspects of aca-
demic careers and the changing role
and experiences of women in such
careers, and Robogals – a new project
that is currently recruiting volunteers.
Robogals is run by student volunteers
who are trained in LEGO robotics and
visit schools to teach LEGO robotics
to girls aged 11-14.
By engaging girls in robotics from
a young age in a fun and educational
way, Robogals aims to increase the
interest and awareness of young girls
in SET subjects and to enhance the
number of girls undertaking these
courses at university.
And if you have more ideas for
WSET, the society’s chair Aiman
AlamNazki says “we are always look-
ing for, and are open to, adding new
projects under our umbrella that will
encourage and motivate the presence
of women in SET fields.”
“We would love to hear from any
new students - male or female! We al-
ways welcome new perspectives and
ideas, and there is plenty of scope for
anyone interested to expand the use of
the portrait exhibition or to contribute
to the society’s other activities” says
Aiman, sending an open invitation to
all new students out there.
Aiman and others at WSET are espe-
cially keen for students to get involved
in their smaller photography project
and Robogals project, both of which
can offer role models or icons that in-
spire the new generation to undertake
a degree in science and motivate them
to perform important research.
“Our activities and projects offer
students the benefit of knowing that
they are making a difference- not only
to the female SET community but to
the entire SET community by break-
ing stereotypes, serving as role models
for girls and increasing the strength of
women in SET.”

W
e’ll be totally honest
and forthright. We have
no solid news for you in
this here fresher’s edi-
tion of Felix. Why? Because once upon
a time we were all freshers, and the last
thing we were interested in was trying
to broaden our minds with basic-level
science in a student newspaper. In
fact, if you’ve even turned to this page
at all, then well done you! Is freshers
week really quite that bad this year or
are you just one of the many thousand
personality-less reclusive drones here
at Imperial who sit painfully in their
rooms awaiting the release of that next
problem sheet? Well, don’t do that (at
least yet. Soon enough everyone will
revert to type so no need to worry
there).
Here we’re going to explain a few
hangover cures which may come in
handy over the start of your university
life. This is a time of your life to experi-
ment, a time to not hold back and just
go for it – whatever ‘it’ may be. Crawl
back into your shell too soon and you’ll
look back when you’re older and think
‘why the bloody hell was I so reluctant
to have a good time while I had the
chance?’
One thing which will undoubtedly
help lubricate the wheels of social co-
hesion is alcohol. If you don’t drink
(whether it be out of choice for health,
religion etc – I couldn’t care either
way) then please ignore. If you do, then
continue reading.
If you haven’t yet learned/trialled/
perfected the following techniques
during your early teenage years then
aside from asking you what the hell
you used to get up to on the weekend,
we will dictate some of the main con-
tenders here.

Together now: ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall...
Our top 10 hangover cures:
Prevention, not cure:
“Don’t drink in the first place!”
Yeah, right.
Advil & Water:
Advil is an anti-inflammatory drug
that contains ibuprofen. Two or
three taken with a glass of water is
supposed to combat the two fac-
tors of dehydration and inflamma-
tion caused by a hangover. By tak-
ing this before bed you counter the
inflammation before its really taken
hold, as opposed to taking it in the
morning.
Water/Lucozade/Gatorade:
You’re hungover because you’re
dehydrated. Water combats dehy-
dration. Capiche? But to optimise
the reversal of dehydration and the
replacement of the mineral rich
bodily fluids that have been lost,
you may want to take some sort of
Isotonic drink.
Sleep:
Sleep as much as possible. Your
body is working extra hard to try
and rectify the mess you have made
of your internal organs. This will
make you sluggish. If your banging
headache isn’t keeping you awake
then try and go back to sleep, so
your poor neglected body doesn’t
have as much work to do.
Fry-up:
After a night’s worth of boozing, the
digestive system gets put under a lot of
strain. Bacon, sausages and the works
may cause indigestion, but fat con-
tains lots of calories so you will receive
a much-needed energy boost. Eggs
and meat are rich in the amino acid
cysteine, thought to be good at clear-
ing out toxins.
Keep drinking (hair of the dog):
Scientific evidence has proved that
this works, but only in the short term.
While your body is busy dealing with
a new intake of booze, it suspends
its torture until you’re done drinking
again - and then it’s back to hangover
hell. So basically by doing this you’re
just avoiding the inevitable. If you
want a bit more science: when the liver
breaks down alcohol it deals with etha-
nol before methanol, of which metha-
nol is the most toxic component, and
by drinking more you delay the metha-
nol metabolism.
Painkillers:
You’re better off avoiding painkillers
altogether. If you desperately need
some, then take in moderation, but be
aware that aspirin and ibuprofen may
irritate your stomach. Paracetamol
gives the liver even more work to do.
Popping pills shouldn’t really be seen
as the easy option.
Cold Shower:
Aside from the sweating, aching,
and vomiting, one of the worst
symptoms of a hangover is that gen-
eral feeling of dirtiness (often en-
hanced by actual dirtiness). Taking
a hot shower only worsens the situ-
ation as you’ll sweat out what little
water remains and just add to the
feeling of queasiness. A cold show-
er, however uncomfortable it may
be, shocks your system and gets
your blood flowing again, thereby
helping your body begin the hard
work of breaking down toxins. Just
a slight warning: Some say such
shocks can actually be harmful,
especially if you’re not as young as
you thought you were last night.
Exercise:
Research has suggested that the
results of going for that post-lash
jog may be worth the pain. By
priming the pump of your booze-
stalled circulatory system, aerobic
exercise can help spur oxygen flow
throughout the body, which can in
turn cause the faster breakdown of
toxins.
A joint:
Apparently a few puffs can appar-
ently do wonders for morning after
nausea – but we obviously can’t rec-
ommend it here.
