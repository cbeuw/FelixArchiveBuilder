f you’re reading this, you’re
either one of two things; a
tramp using this newspaper as
bedding/some light bedtime
reading, or you’ll be a Fresher
who’s picked up this newspaper from
your bed. Though you’re more likely
to be the latter, we’re all about equal
opportunities here at Felix, so a big
shout-out to the tramps of London.
Now back to the matter in hand.
You’ve made it to university and if
it’s your first time, it is an unrivalled
experience. I’m sure you’ve heard it
all; it’s a fresh start, the best years of
your life and so on. Well, I hate to say
it, but they’re all true.
If everything else isn’t exciting
enough, you’ve also decided to try
your hand at one the world’s best
universities. You fool. If you’re one
to thrive on academia, then you’re at
the right place. Every Fresher will have
a lot on their plate though, and it’s just
a choice of what to eat and what to
leave.
Firstly, you’re in London. All you can
do is explore the sprawling metropolis
that is this beautiful city. Visit the obvi-
ous sites: Trafalgar Square, Southbank,
Oxford Circus, Camden and whatnot,
but there is so much more to see and
do, as you might have guessed.
You will run into so many things dur-
ing your years in London, and a lot of
them you will do so by accident. You’ll
discover all sorts of places, from cosy
pubs to hidden underground clubs,
your new favourite restaurant to your
new favourite cafe, and from small
record stalls amongst a bustling street
market to a hidden treasure of a garden
where you’ll waste away many a night.
Though we’ll have to drag you back
to Imperial kicking and screaming,
you’ll soon realise there’s plenty going
on campus too. It’ll be hard not to hear
about what is going on, but it will be
hard deciding what to start doing first.
The Union will help you pack out
your events schedule for the first couple
of weeks. Alongside their bars, shops
and events, they also help organise
around 300 clubs and societies that run
throughout the year.
This issue of Felix contains a plan for
this year’s Freshers’ Fair. Freshers’ Fair
is a chance for you to see and sign up
to all the different clubs and societies
that Imperial has to offer. So make sure
you turn up, and head straight to the
Felix stand. Here, you’ll meet some of
the current Editors, and put your name
down to write for Felix if you fancy
yourself as a budding journalist.
Expect to see Felix littered across
College throughout the week, and
especially on Fridays when each is-
sue is released. We’re the student
newspaper of Imperial, and that
means we’re entirely student run.
Though the offices are always a
place of laughter and banter, we do
pride ourselves in being the best stu-
dent newspaper in the country (ask
the Guardian Student Media Award
judges, wahhheyyyyy....). We’re not
ones to rest on past laurels however,
and that’s why we need you Fresh-
ers to make it that much better and...
well, fresh.
What you’re reading now is a spe-
cial issue just for Freshers like you.
So feel special, have a read through
the paper, chuckle in the appropri-
ate places, put the paper down, then
start the rest of your life here at Im-
perial College.
