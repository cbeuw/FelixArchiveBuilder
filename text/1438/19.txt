W
elcome to the Felix
Technology section
for the 2009-2010 year.
Here you’ll find the lat-
est and greatest news and reviews from
the consumer electronics industry. If
you’re interested in gadgets, tech and
computers this is the place for you.
Whilst we’re keeping you up to speed
on the latest developments, we’ll also
provide some hopefully useful articles
to both entertain and enlighten you
(not guaranteed) spanning a variety
of topics. We’ll also try to point out
useful tools, tips and services that, as
students, enable you to work and play
smarter.
Throughout the year we’ll be cover-
ing events, announcements and the
new and the hot from across the indus-
try. Whether it be new iPhones, 3D TV
or the latest personal transport con-
traption, there’s a lot to look forward
to this year.
As most new and exciting tech is
announced or unveiled at expos and
trade shows here are some events to
keep an eye on in the next year:
CES 2010, the consumer electronics
show, which is held each year in Las
Vegas, is arguably the biggest event
in the tech calendar. CES hits us this
year between 7-10th of January and
will look to have some surprises up it’s
sleeve. Look out for 3D TVs, more mo-
tion recognition gaming (Project Natal
etc), OLED screens growing larger and

Fresher’s Imperial Tech
Survival Guide
W
elcome Freshers! You’ve
made it to Imperial, a
place where technol-
ogy and life should be
as one. I’ll leave that up to you to de-
cide, but here’s a quick guide to tech at
college and out and about in London
to see you through your first couple of
weeks.
There are plenty of computers scat-
tered around Imperial. Armed with
your IC login, you have full unadulter-
ated access to the internet. Be warned
that there is a usage policy and ICT is
watching, as those of us who have fall-
en foul in the past can attest.
So where can you get at a computer?
Well the Library has quite a few, from
the ground floor Café to the individual
topic floors with books (remember
them right?). There are also a few scat-
tered outside the SCR and most de-
partments around college have at least
one dedicated computer suite. Rumor
has it that some departments are better
endowed than others (here’s looking at
you Mech Eng), so if you find yourself
short in one department check out
your neighboring departments.
Of course if you’re the roll your own
type, brandishing your nice and shiny
pride and joy, Imperial has a campus
wide wireless network. Imperial-WPA
is the preferred connection and can
be logged onto with pretty much any
modern device, including iPhones/
Gphones, with your Imperial login
details. Some halls are kitted out for
WiFi, but many still rely on Ethernet
connection in rooms, which are also a
great deal faster.
Whilst using a non-college computer
you can still get access to your Home
or H drive by using the Home direc-
tory finder (on the Imperial ICT web-
site) and following the instructions.
Your email account can also be ac-
cessed using Exchange, IMAP or POP
depending on what your needs are.
Snow Leopard users will be pleased
to hear that Imperial runs Exchange
2007 meaning all your Mac apps work
brilliantly with your college account.
Windows users will need Outlook for
full interoperability with calendar, con-
tacts and email. If you’re out and about,
your email can also be got at through
the Outlook Web Access (http://icex.
imperial.ac.uk) in any browser, though
to get the non ‘light’ version you’ll need
Internet Explorer *sigh*.
This week, Technology Editor Samuel Gibbs, brings you a quick
and dirty rundown of the ins and outs of tech life at Imperial
Speaking of Halls, tech doesn’t stop
at the door. Many Halls are kitted out
with LCDs, games consoles, DVD/Blu-
Ray players and shared computers. If
you’ve got your own TV with you (you
crazy kids) don’t forget you’ll ‘need’ a
TV license, even for those with PC TV
Everyone needs music at some point
during their studies, whether it’s for
working or rocking a party. These days
music is available everywhere, some
of it legally, quite a lot of it not. So if
you’re sick of your music collection or
only or you only brought a couple of
CDs with you, why not check out Spot-
ify for your free and legal music hit.
If you’ve had been living under a
rock for the last year and don’t have
the foggiest what I’m on about then
head on over to spotify.com and grab
the client. The service provides unlim-
ited streaming of a large music library
with artists from EMI, Sony, Univeral,
Warner and some other smaller la-
bels. There’s the odd advert between
songs here and there and there are ads
displayed in the program itself but if
you’re after music on the cheap you
can’t get much better. Unfortunately
Spotify has just gone invitation only
for the time being, it should go back to
general subscription in the future, but
you can stick your email in there for in-
vites. Spotify also runs a subscription
based model at £9.99 a month with a
£0.99 24-hour day pass for trial pur-
poses, which is still open for sign-ups if
you’re keen on the idea or want Spotify
on your iPhone or Android device.
Another decent free and legal music
service is the selective internet radio
provided by Last.fm. Listeners select a
track or artist and start a ‘radio station’
based around the type of music the
track or artist represents. If you just
want to listen to some music and not
specific tracks then Last.fm is great.
The service also uses a recommenda-
tion engine, which learns by ‘Scrob-
bling’ the music you listen to into a da-
tabase of likes and dislikes, to predict
tracks you’d like and recommend new
artists and concerts. A player can be
downloaded from Last.fm or streamed
straight off the website.
tuner cards.
Imperial, especially South Ken, is a
pretty benign place overall but there
are a few things to be aware of now
that you’re here. A decent firewall and
antivirus is a must if you’re a PC user.
If you’re connected to the college net-
work literally thousands of people can,
with a bit of know-how, find and have a
go at your computer, so make sure you
use protection. After all, you wouldn’t
want to go home to your Mum with a
nasty infection now would you? Mac
users make sure you have your firewall
on, by default it’s off, because people
can still steal your stuff. Backups, you
probably hear this a lot, are the savior
of many a poor soul. From hardware
failures, accidents, thieves and mal-
ware, there are lots of things that could
happen to your data. Irreplaceable
photos of your roommate slumped in
the corner with marker pen all over his
face, as well as coursework, needn’t be
lost should you have a good backup.
Physical protection for your gear is
also important. It doesn’t happen very
often, but being a public place, nefari-
ous types can get into Halls and raid
rooms. It happened several times when
I was a whippersnapper like yourselves
and those who weren’t insured paid
dearly. Insurance for your possessions
in halls can be difficult to find from
non-student insurers, but the likes
of Endsleigh specialize in insurance
geared up for Halls and at reasonable
rates too. You might also be able to get
cover specified on your parents house-
hold insurance for a nominal fee, so get
them to check with their provider. Sto-
len gear doesn’t always have to mean a
wrecked week, if you’re covered.
Of course you’re not just here in
London to study, so your tech life
should follow you out and about in the
capital. Thankfully the networks have
gotten off their backsides and provide
pretty good 3G signal across London
for those equipped with smartphones,
modems and portable hotspots. For
those seeking a bit of WiFi, London
just so happens to be one of the most
connected cities on the planet with al-
most every coffee shop on every cor-
ner offering WiFi.
Quite a few BT phone boxes and
even some lampposts about the city
are also hotspots so the likelihood is
that you’ll be able to get your hit from
almost anywhere. Most hotspots are
run by BT, T-mobile, the Cloud and
O2, but having an account with one
of them normally means you can log
into others using a cross network login
system.
From experience I know this doesn’t
always work, but when it does, it’s
great.
You can even get programs such as
DeviceScape that deal with the hassle
of logging in for you automatically.

If you’re feeling a bit short of gadg-
ets then London also boasts quite a
few shops to cater for your inner tech.
The ‘world famous’ Tottenham Court
Road plays host to quite a few compu-
ter, gadget and consumer electronics
shops including Micro Anvika, Gul-
tronics and Brains HiFi, which sells,
you guessed it, HiFi equipment. Tot-
tenham Court Road has 3 tube stations
along it, Tottenham Court Road (Cen-
tral line), Goodge Street (Northern
line) and Warren Street (Northern and
Victoria lines) so it’s easy to get there
and back with your goods. London also
plays host to two Apple stores, Regent
Street and Westfield, should you be a
Mac-o-phile. There’s even a PC World,
if you absolutely must, located close to
college on High Street Ken.
Of course being tech savvy as you all
of course are, online is probably your
best bet if you’re prepared to wait.
Ebuyer.com is always a good bet, dabs.
com is also worth a check. If you’re after
some more unusual portable tech then
Expansys.com, which specialises in un-
locked phones, imported gadgets and a
variety of accessories to kit you out.
other interesting developments.
The now Apple-less MacWorld 2010
(will Apple have their own event in Q4/
Q1 2010?) takes place 3-13th February
in San Francisco. If new accessories are
your thing then this year shouldn’t dis-
appoint. For the rest of us MacWorld
minus Apple is a bit like a burger with-
out the meat.
CeBIT 2010 held between 2-6th
March in Hanover, Germany, is a prime
showcase for a lot of portable comput-
ing. Look out for new netbooks, PNDs,
computer parts and accessories. Also
keep an eye out for a boat load of pat-
ent infringement arrests if this year
was anything to go by.
Apple holds it’s own events through-
out the year, because they’re, you know,
‘special’. So expect some sort of new
announcements in Q2 around May/
June, with WWDC 2010 (World Wide
Developers Conference). The recently
held annual Q3 music event, ‘It’s just
Rock and Roll’, brought updates across
the iPod line including a camera wield-
ing iPod nano. The iPod touch got very
little love from Apple, rumours of cam-
era module issues abound, so expect
some sort of iPod touch announce-
ment in the near future.

cific you want covered, got a tip or
suggestion, or just want to complain,
