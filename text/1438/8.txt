The No. 14 Bus: Putney to Warren St via Picadilly Circus. A ride of pure joy.
At your beck and call
Hello and welcome to Imperial and fe-
lix. This is where I pull together some
advice to let you know what I wish I
knew at the start of my time at Impe-
rial. The most important thing is to get
the balance right between studying and
having a good time. Obviously every-
one has different targets and levels of
drive, but you still must remember that
either extremes of studying or partying
are bad for you.
If you’re having personal problems
or are struggling with your workload
there’s a number of people you can
turn to.
Let someone know you’re struggling,
be it friends. This can be your personal
tutor, one of the wardens in your halls
or myself in the Union. Imperial Col-
lege Union is a separate organisation
from Imperial College, so if you have
a problem and feel you can’t talk to
someone in College about it, free con-
fidential and independent advice can
be given by the us.
We also have a dedicated Student
Adviser, Nigel Cooke, who works in
the Advice Centre on level 2 mezza-
nine. You can come and see him about
any issue, including Academic Advice,
Accommodation, Complaints, Con-
sumer Rights, Diversity and Equal-
ity, Employment Rights, Exam Stress,
Health and Wellbeing, International
Student Issues, Money Advice and Per-
sonal Safety.
Nigel also has links with all the Col-
lege welfare services and also legal ad-
vice centres in the local community,
so if he can’t help we can find some-
one who will be able to locally. We are
also full members of Advice UK which
is an agency which encourages good
practice in advice centres around the
country. The Advice Centre acts as an
advocate for students; to College and
also to outside organisations when we
feel a student needs extra help to solve
an issue, acting on your behalf with
your permission.
Both Nigel and myself are in close
contact with the College welfare serv-
ices, including the Health Centre,
Student Counselling Service, Careers
Advisory Service and Disability Of-
ficer. For more details check out the
Information and Advice pages on our
website. The Chaplaincy is also avail-
able to talk about any issues you may
want to talk about.
Personal safety is paramount and
when planning a night on the tiles it’s
important not only to decide on the
multitude of seedy venues that make
a good night out, but also to sort out
your route home. The route planner
on the Transport for London website is
amazing and it’s always worth memo-
rising the route of the number 14 bus.
It goes pretty close to the favourite
student hot spots in the West End and
runs all round the clock. Also remem-
ber that the number for Cabwise is also
given on every bus stop. It’s run by TFL
You probably know by now, but Deputy President (Welfare)
John James reiterates: we are here to guide, help and advise
and if you text 60835, they send you the
numbers of one taxi firm and two li-
censed minicab operators near to your
current location. It costs the standard
network rate +35p, but it’s a small price
to pay for a safe journey home.
Both of us will be at Freshers’ Fair
handing out condoms and other good-
ies (personal attack alarms, night bus
maps, cycle routes etc), so if you have
any questions or want to say hello, pop
over and see us, especially if you want
to lend a hand running some of the
Welfare Campaigns we have planned
this year. Remember that the next few
weeks of settling in are going to be a bit
of a rollercoaster, but that the friends
you make in the next year will probably
be the ones that you keep for the rest of
your life. With that in mind I can only
encourage you to get out and meet
as many people as possible, be nice
to them, avoid eating fat, read a good
book every now and then, get some
walking in and try and live together in
peace and harmony with people of all
creeds and nations. Here’s the theme
music.
Advising you
well......
H
i, my name is Nigel Cooke.
I am the Student Adviser
here at Imperial College
Union and I work in The
Advice Centre.
I am here to help you with any Wel-
fare issues you may have during your
time studying here these include:
• Academic appeals and
complaints
• Debt Advice
• Housing Rights
• Employment Rights
• Consumer Rights
• Personal Safety
• International Students Issues
I also can help with issues such as
drugs, alcohol and sexual health. You
may never need our service but now
you are here, being a student it is not as
easy as people think and you may face
struggles or issues that you feel you can-
not handle yourself.
The Advice Centre is your free serv-
ice for confidential, impartial and inde-
pendent advice. At the union we pride
ourselves on being independent so you
can be sure that if you approach us with
an issue, we will give you our honest
opinion on the issue and help to em-
power you to solve it.
The Advice Centre also has links with
all college welfare agencies and legal
advice centres in the local community.
So if we can’t help, we can find someone
who will be able to locally. We are also
full members of Advice UK, an agency
which encourages good practice in ad-
vice centres.
The Advice Centre advocates for
students both to the college and also
to outside organisations. When we
feel you, the student, needs extra help
we can act on your behalf with your
permission.
We also consider ourselves to be an
information giving service, so if you just
need some information on the college
or the local area we are the best people
to contact for this. We will be able to
point you in the right direction.
So whether you just want some in-
formation on where the best local place
is to get a burger or if you have a more
pressing issue, make The Advice Centre
your one stop shop for all your welfare
issues and needs.
The Advice Centre will have a stall
at Fresher’s Fair, so if you fancy getting
a freebie and having a chat feel free to
come over for a natter!
The Advice Centre is situated in the
mezzanine level of the Union building
in the Beit Quad.

Make sure that you’re vaccinated against infections!
Fortunately, mumps and meningitis
are rare illnesses. However, they do
occur, and when they do they tend to
be in the student age group. There are
several reasons for this, but the first
week of term is not the time (and Felix
is not the place) for an epidemiology
lecture in infectious disease and herd
immunity. Suffice to say that a large
group of partially vaccinated adults
from different parts of the world, liv-
ing and working in close proximity and
often in close contact with each other,
provides an ideal opportunity for these
rare infections to occur. And they do.
Unfortunately, when they do oc-
cur they can be serious. Meningococ-
cal disease (meningitis) can kill, and
mumps can lead to reduced fertility.
For this reason in the UK there is a free
vaccination programme for those up to
and including 24 years of age i.e. those
most at risk. The vaccinations dramat-
ically reduce an individual’s chances of
developing these illnesses, but they are
not perfect: there is still a small chance
of infection.
Under the current NHS vaccination
criteria, people aged 25 and above are
not eligible for free vaccinations as
they are at much reduced risk.
Regardless of our vaccination status,
age, or any other factor, all of us need
to be aware of the early signs of these
infections. For more information see
the leaflets in your Health Centre Wel-
come Pack or visit our website www.
imperialcollegehealthcentre.co.uk.
You need to make sure that you are
covered. Have you had:
• Two mumps vaccinations
• One meningitis C vaccination
If you are under 25 years old you need
to be absolutely sure you have had
the appropriate vaccinations against
mumps and meningitis C.
The best way to find out whether
you have had these vaccinations is to
ask your parents. Your GP may have
a record of your childhood vaccina-
tions but may not know if you have had
MenC (the meningitis C vaccination).
Even if you are eligible to register with
us, Imperial College Health Centre will
not receive your NHS notes for several
months, by which time it is too late.
If you are at all unsure about having
had these vaccinations please contact
the Health Centre as soon as possible.
This is urgent as the vaccinations take
several weeks to work, during which
time you may be at increased risk of
these illnesses. We are running spe-
cial vaccination clinics during the
first week of term to try and minimise
the risk to students so visit www.im-
perialcollegehealthcentre.co.uk/
vaccinations.
Having too many vaccinations is
not a problem, so where there is any
doubt we usually give the vaccination
rather than put you at increased risk of
infection.
Before I go, there’s time to tell you
more about the Health Centre. Your
health is likely the last thing your mind
is on at the start of term. However it
is strongly recommended that you are
registered with a GP local to where
you live in term time. Most students
are eligible to register with us. Do this
quickly, before you become ill! We of-
fer a host of services so please visit
www.imperialcollegehealthcentre.
co.uk for more information.
Have you had the following?:
• Two mumps vaccinations
• One meningitis C vaccination
YES NO
I DON’T
KNOW!
Great! Nothing to
worry about then.
Register with the Health
Centre and book yourself
in for a vaccination.
Ask your parents. If
they don’t know, get
vaccinated anyway.
