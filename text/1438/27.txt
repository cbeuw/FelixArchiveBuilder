I want to
ride my
bicycle
Over the course of 6 days 100 people
covered 542 miles by bicycle from Ed-
inburgh to London raising a total of
£140,000 for ‘Right to Play’, a charity
chosen by British Universities & Col-
leges Sport (BUCS).
I signed up for the challenge as I
wanted to try something new and this
sounded like a fantastic opportunity
to support a charity that uses sport
and play to reach out to children and
youths from the most disadvantaged
areas in the world. I had no idea what
the actual ride would be like so from
day one climbing through the Edin-
burgh hills to Berwick was an eye-
opening experience as to what was
in store for the next 5 days. The first
few days were very hilly [sic] as well as
long, making it really tough. On top
of that we had some cross winds and a
little bit of rain just to remind us that
we were up North! The days were very
long, setting off before 9am and arriv-
ing after 7pm most nights, just in time
for some food and a hot shower.
For me the hardest day was cycling
from Newcastle to Leeds; we eventu-
ally arrived at 9pm having cycled 110
miles and conquered some big hills in
the process. There was just enough
time to eat and shower before resting
up for the following day which was an-
other gruelling 105 miles.
All in all it was an unforgettable
challenge, both physically and men-
tally and I will cherish the experi-
ence for the rest of my life. The ca-
maraderie that came with such a trip
was awesome. Each and every one of
us experienced highs and lows and
helped one another throughout the
week. Being a part of the sea of yel-
low shirts that cycled down the mall
at Buckingham Palace was fantastic
and brought to life the reality of what
we achieved and the reason we had
raised so much money for Right to
Play.

Imperial staff and students take part in
charity bike ride from Edinburgh to London
AllisaAyling Sports Partnership
Round up! Round up! 2008/2009 season a success
across the board for Imperial’s sports teams
So you’re new to Imperial and want
to try out a sport during your time
here. You read the Freshers’ Handbook
which has all the sports clubs on offer
but you still can’t decide which to join
(if haven’t read it then why not? In case
you’re wondering, the Handbook is the
booklet with a red front cover. So now
you know what it is, go and read it!).
Well do not fear, felixSport is here to
give you a breakdown of some of the
sports clubs, as well as letting you
know how they have performed in the
past.
First thing’s first, most of the tri-
als will occur on the first Wednesday
of term (7th October), so be sure to
have all your kit ready when you ar-
rive; the remaining trials will occur at
the weekend(10th-11th October). If in
doubt, just ask the members at their

stalls at Freshers’ Fair which is held on
the first Tuesday of term. Following the
trials on the Wednesday, all the sports
teams converge onto the Union for
the first Sports Night of the year (they
don’t actually call it a Sports Night, but
it pretty much is) so be sure to keep the
night free as it is the perfect chance
for all of you to meet your fellow club
members and potential friendly rivals.
But before you can do any of that, you
still need to choose which sport is the
right one for you. A lot of people de-
cide they want a change when they
come to university; this maybe be-
cause their school didn’t offer much
else apart from rugby for the boys and
netball for the girls and cross country
for both. At university, however, the
world is your oyster and Imperial has a
wide range of sports. So if you weren’t
very good at sport at school but had
no choice, now you do. Similarly, if
you were good at a particular sport,
then rest assured our top flight teams
will be the right ones for you. All the
clubs offer the full range of participa-
tion, from beginners to national level,
everyone is welcome and everyone
socialises after the games which are
played on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
So let’s start from the top of last year’s
felixSports League (Page 27).
IC (College) Tennis Men’s 1sts were
the clear winners last year with a per-
fect 5.0 score to be crowned as the
champions.
The gentlemen who aspire to be the
bottle job phenomenon that is Andy
Murray have certainly proven their
worth as team of 2008/2009 and can
only be described as unbeatable. Blow-
ing away their counterparts in BUCS
league 2A, they both scored more
points and conceded less than anyone
in the league. In the BUCS Knockout
Championships they emerged victori-
ous as they won all of their rounds.
Winning over four-fifths of their 31
games, the fencers have produced re-
markable results. The women stayed
ahead of long-time rivals Oxford over
the course of the season to lift the
BUCS Premiership Trophy. The men’s
1sts will be in the Premiership next
year after going unbeaten in 1A and
eventually destroying Bath 135-37
in the Premiership Playoff Final. The
2nds, in a league mainly composed of
1st teams, finished a respectable 2nd
