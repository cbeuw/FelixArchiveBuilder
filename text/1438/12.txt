Good
afternoon/evening!*
This
whole
Fresher
thing
is
rather
overwhelming.
No?
Just
me?
Oh.
Anyway......
My
name
is
_________
__________,
and
I’m
from
__________.
I’m
studying
_____________,

I’m
in
___________
Hall.
I
got
A’s
in
________,
_________,
_________,
and
_________
at
A
Level.
I
want
to
be
a
dedicated

up....
Pint?/Now

me
alone,
freak.*
*Delete
as
appropriate
CUT
ALONG
DASHED
LINE
You’ll
be
needing
this.......
Once
your
brain
implodes
from
being
asked
the
same
set
of
ice-breaking
questions,
you
can
just
simply
fill
this
speech
bubble
out,
cut
around
the
dashed
line,
and
hold
it
beside
your
head
and
skip
the
introductions.
Then
you
can
get
talking
about
the
good
stuff
like
beer/animals
with
casts/cake.*
