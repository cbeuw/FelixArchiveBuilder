Freshers’ Week Survival Gaming
W
ithout wishing to
alarm anyone, it’s true
what they say - you’re
about to walk into the
most overwhelming week of your
life. Good news though - as a gamer,
you’ve got an instant method of es-
cape. Here’s your first seven days in
London in gaming form, and they’re
all either free to try or completely
bloody free, thus allowing you to be-
gin your journey into studenthood
on the cheap. Get used to it.
By the time this week’s over you’ll
be settled in and kicking back as if
you’ve been here for years. Until
then, assume the foetal position and
read on.
Remember to go out at some point
though, obviously.
DON’T PANIC. Sure, you’re in the middle of nowhere, you don’t know anyone, your dad dropped your PC
carrying it up the stairs and you can’t remember how to cook toast. But you’ll always have games.
Saturday
OH MY CHRIST YOU’RE A UNI-
VERSITY STUDENT. Okay. Okay,
don’t panic. Must calm down.
Mustn’t overreact. How about a nice,
relaxing game of Bejewelled. Ahh.
That’s what you want. Download the
free demo off of Steam, fire up the
‘Endless’ mode where you can’t fail,
and start matching gems. Swap adja-
cent gems on the grid to create lines
of three, and they fizz and disappear,
whilst all the time playing a sooth-
ing, new-age-y soundtrack. It’s the
gaming equivalent of a shiatsu mas-
sage, except it’s addictive as hell, so
perhaps not wholly recommended
for the first day.
Sunday
OH MY GOD YOU’RE STILL
HERE. Yes, it wasn’t a dream. Your
halls will probably be trying to drag
you all over the city today, but you’ll
eventually find some time to have a
sit down, so why not celebrate ex-
ploring a new city by taking a look
at the charming and humourous
Spelunky. It’s a tomb raiding game,
with randomly-generated levels and
a whole bunch of perfect Indiana
Jones bits like golden statues, boul-
der traps, whips and dames.
So, so much fun, so do persevere
past your first few insta-deaths and
you’ll find it a great distraction from
any latent homesickness, as well as
the desire to dress up like Han Solo.
Monday
Welcome to the first proper week-
day. This might be your day off, so
you’ll want to get out a bit. Since
we’re on the subject - the nearest
Game store is on High Street Ken-
sington (two stops along the Circle
line from South Kensington Tube),
and while you’re out you can catch
some of the local scenery. If you find
yourself with nothing to do though,
why not sink your teeth into N. N is
a beautifully crisp platformer that
made it big on the XBox last year, but
is available for free on the PC. You
play a gold-grabbing ninja across
five hundred extremely challenging
levels. It’s polished, huge and very,
very playable for the first day.
Tuesday
It’s Fresher’s Fair! Other than signing
up to Felix, on account of how inspir-
ing and leaderly the Games editors
are, you might also drop by the Com-
puter Games Society. They organise
occasional LAN parties and pretty
regular gaming sessions where they
hijack a lecture theatre and project
Guitar Hero and Halo 3 onto big
screens. It’s good times.
You’ll be knackered by the time you
get back, so just take a quick look at
Droplitz.
It’s a fast and simple platformer with
some sickeningly addictive game
modes that put you in a kind of eerie
zen-like state. Bing! You’re relaxed.
Job done.
Wednesday
For most of you, lectures will be
looming. If you’re still feeling a bit
groggy from months and months of
sod all, check out Make It Good, an
utterly brilliant text adventure that’ll
kickstart the brain cells. You play a
classic private detective, sent to in-
vestigate the murder of an account-
ant. But the design of the adventure
is such that you really do get to be
a detective - you can send evidence
back for analysis, you can deceive
witnesses to get more information,
and yet it never feels like you’re
playing a basic puzzle game. It really
does have that mystery book feel. If
you’ve got an hour to spare, sink into
this.
Thursday
Congratulations! If you’ve started
lectures today then you’re officially a
scientist. How does it feel? Sciencey?
To commemorate this, revisit the
online hit of 2009, Fantastic Con-
traption. It’s a puzzle game with a
natty physics engine that asks you
to construct elaborate inventions to
transport a pink dot to the goal. It’s
a bitty game too, so you can slot in
a quick ten minute bash in between
stalking the pretty girl from Geology
and exploring Knightsbridge.
Friday
The end of the week! You just sur-
vived seven days as a university stu-
dent, not bad. If you’ve not already
given up on socialising and haven’t
got fully stuck in to late-night ses-
sions of Team Fortress 2, you’ll still
have enough time to take a look
at the last pick for the week - it’s
Zafehouse, a charming zombie
apocalypse simulator that lets you
rename characters so you can take
your newfound friends and sacrifice
them in order to save yourself. Or,
uh, get them to work together and
survive. Whatever. Either way, don’t
overthink it - you survived the week!
Huzzah. Pick up felix today and see
what we’ve got in store for you then.
