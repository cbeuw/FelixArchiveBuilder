HANGMAN
Hangman Unknown
hangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk
“Why won’t you give us a chance, we’re not so bad” (Oh man, I can’t wait to meet
this hottie when she comes to Imperial in 15 years - Hangman Ed)
This year’s Freshers
lamer than ever
The atmosphere in David’s office is
awkward and heavy. I’m sitting at his
desk as he paces up and down the tiny
space between his filing cabinet and
the desk of the lecturer he shares the
office with; thankfully he’s out, I can’t
imagine that three people would fit in
the room.
David’s upset, he’s gesturing wildly
as he huffs and puffs, pausing only to
blurt out expletives about this year’s
crop of freshers, “Bastards!” and “Te-
dious and bloody boring, all of them!
God!”.
He finally sits down and I ask him
why he believes that this year’s freshers
are substantially inferior to any previ-
ous years.
“I don’t know what’s happened, but
the difference is obvious, anyone who’s
been on Facebook all summer looking
at the fresher’s groups could tell you.
They’re so bloody unfriendly, I mes-
saged one girl asking her “Where she
got a body like that” and she reported
me to Facebook. Times have changed,
they’re so damn uptight!”
He gets a call and goes outside into
the corridor. While he’s gone I sneak-
a-peek on his facebook profile, he’s
listed as attending the Mingle, I decide
to press him on this when he returns. I
look at his inbox, there are several mes-
sages from freshers, some kind, some
confused, one telling him that she “got
a body like that from her mother who’s
a judge, so back off”.
David returns to the room and I
quickly jump back to my chair, he
seems much happier now.
“Great news!” he beams, “I just spoke
to my friend, a sub-warden in Beit, and
he’s got me a free ticket to the Mingle”
He tells me that he’s been every year
since he was a fresher, this year will
be the 6th time that he’s been to the
Mingle. “Oh yeah, it’s great, everyone’s
really nervous and worried about mak-
ing friends so it’s really easy to be really
confident and talk to really hot girls
because they’re just glad to be talking
to someone. It’s like a funeral really”
It’s seems strange to me that he’s
so excited about going to the Mingle
when he’s quite harsh about the fresh-
ers who are going to be there, I ask him
about this.
“You’re right, you’re right, but man
compared to the Mingle when I was a
fresher, it’s been shit every year. In my
year I got with like 6 girls but they’ve
been getting more and more uptight
ever since, last year I only snogged
one girl and she’d had about twelve
snakebites so it didn’t really count”
but don’t worry he reassures me, “This
PhD student hits out against people that he hasn’t met yet
year I have a plan”. His eyes gleam as he
reaches into his desk drawer and pulls
out a small bag of powder. He places it
in front of me triumphantly, I look at
him aghast, “Is that, is that a date-rape
drug?”
“What! No man! It’s fucking coke,
I’m going to score at the mingle with
this stuff man, seriously I’m always so
interesting when I’m coked up, I’m the
life of the fucking party, these freshers
might be lame, but if they put out then
maybe I’ll forgive them.”
David died later that same day in a
motorcycle accident... meh.
Hangman’s
Gardening Tips
W
ith all the hustle and
bustle of moving in to
your newly acquired
accommodation, you
have more than likely forgotten to
tend to your allotment. Imperial Col-
lege gives you a great space of land in
the centre of Knightsbridge to grow
your own vegetables and fruits and if
you neglect your personal garden it
will end up overgrown with weeds and
such. For those of you who have not
yet been given you allotment number
seek advice from the Student Hub lo-
cated on level 3 Sherfield building.
There they will give you your allotment
number, directions and swipe cards to
access the private complex.
Complete beginners need not worry
about what to do with their garden, as
Hangman is here to teach the ways of
ninja cultivation. The first thing you
need is an array of tools. When we
say tool we don’t mean the Deputy
Editor Kadhim Shubber, we mean fully
fledged instruments of brutal execu-
tion. That’s right manly tools! Again
not an attribute of Deputy ESditor Ka-
dhim Shubber. In fact we recommend
just one tool, one manly blister form-
ing tool. Your bear hands. Long finger-
nails are also a bonus.
Now your all set to begin planting
your crops, so when the spring comes
you can harvest the sweet sweet boun-
ty mother nature has provided you.
However like many novice students
out there you probably have no idea
what to plant. Do you? DO YOU?! I
thought not. Well Imperial College has
that covered too. If you go the level M
of the Union building situated in Beit
Quadrangle you’ll meet a man call Ash-
ley Brown. Now Ash, as we like to call
him, has organised for Imperial Col-
lege Union to provide you with seeds
to sow in you personal paradise. With a
wide selection ranging from carrots to
salvia there is bound to be something
you want to plant. We heard from a not
so reliable source that if you slip him
£5 under the counter he will provide
seeds previously only available from
the black market.
Everytime you
get offended, a
baby dies
Ev
ge
L
isten, well read, but you
know what I mean. You may
have already read the rest of
this page and may already
be typing an angrily worded
email to the Editor, with hangman.
felix@imperial.ac.uk ‘cc’ed. You are
probably quite offended.
But let me tell you something. I hate
being CCed into emails, if you got
something to say, then say it directly to
me, you got that?
If you send all your angrily worded
emails directly to hangman.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk then everyone will be much
happier. Dan “The Cunt” Wan, the
Editor won’t have to read your whiny
emails and therefore won’t know to
what extent the bullocks that I write on
this page destroys his reputation and
the reputation of felix but more impor-
tantly, I’ll spot the subject heading “I
CAN’T BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT”
in my mailbox and delete the message
without reading it, so nobody will know
how much you hate me. I don’t know if
this will make you happier but I some-
how doubt it, also I don’t care.
Now, this is an anonymously ed-
ited page, so you’ll probably think lots
of crazy thoughts like, “I bet the guys
who edit this page are lame and prob-
ably can’t get laid”
. Let me correct you,
each of the three guys who edit this page
have girlfriends, cute girlfriends at that.
Although, my girlfriend is kind of angry
at me and the other two are from the
North which isn’t ideal but hey, sex is
sex and my girlfriend won’t be annoyed
at me forever... (Your girlfriend hates
you, like everyone hates you - Ed)
Let me finish by saying this, go to
Tiger Tiger and Onanon and Opal be-
cause I don’t want to see ANY of you
anywhere else in London. They invent-
ed shit clubs in Leicester Square so that
my friends and I could go out in London
without having to endure the horror of
your presence, so please, give Rough
Hill my thanks.

to wrap duct tape

So that it doesn’t
