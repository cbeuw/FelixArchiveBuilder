S
o there’s a new batch of star-
ry eyed Freshers about. And
by about, I mean taking up
your space at the bar, then
vomiting in a biffa bin and
generally failing to handle their beer in
a way that a man would. But it’s nice to
have you, I’m sure you’ll all settle down
quickly- join a sports club, get drunk,
deal with your hangover. That’s what I
did.
Well, now that’s over and done with
I can get down to ranting and raving
about life, the universe and everything-
this week is directed towards women.
Right, you, the fairer sex, listen. Seri-
ously, what the fuck? To all those fresh-
ers who come here with a girlfriend,
good luck to you, she’ll be gone by the
time you finish reading this column. I
split with my girl about a month after
summer term finished, I say I split, I
didn’t do much of the splitting. I had
the option of crying like a big gay baby
or doing some hardcore manning up. I
chose and eclectic balance of the two.
Upside is that I am back on the market
(I no longer sport that monstrous ‘tash
sorry) whoop! Anyway I am willing to
help men all over the world/ the 5000
readership by printing a few helpful re-
lationship based hints.
1. We are men. We eat, drink, sleep
and occasionally buy some ridiculous
gadget we won’t ever need just so we
can say we did to our mates. We are
not clairvoyants. Never will be. If some
shit is wrong, you’re going use your
mouth and bring it to our attention-
or else we will be happy to assume all
is lush. Maybe work it into a phone
conversation, because you do love the
phone. In fact, I’d happily accept a note
suck to the fridge- anything really.
2. We tend to do very little thinking,
so when you demand of us ‘what were
you thinking?’, we don’t know because
we don’t think. We did it for one of two
reasons: a) banter, b) I was drunk. Ei-
ther way, we’re sorry. Sit down, have a
cup of tea, put on Barry Manilow’s ‘I
Can’t Smile Without You’ and just chill
the fuck out. Then feel free to attack
us with the rolling pin if you still feel
it necessary.
3. On the off chance that we do we
enquire as to what is bothering you,
we do expect, but don’t wish to have
to recreate Moses’ attempts of getting
water from a stone. Could you please
just make it a lot easier and just, you
know... tell us? Then we might ask
more often and not just assume every-
thing is dandy, as stipulated in point 1.
4. Finally, and most importantly:
if you’ve had a crazy ex-boyfriend,
please, please don’t take it out on us.
We’ll try our best, but could you ob-
serve the above three points and make
a small attempt to follow them?
Now, I don’t claim to be some great
advice giver, well not yet anyway, but
I can safely say that that is some of the
most useful stuff you will read this year.
Forget lectures- do you actually give a
perfectly formed shit about the com-
plex number j? Guessing not, if you
do, you’re a right fucking nut job, go to
the Si-Fi library. Finally, just to piss all
over your small fresher bonfires, there
are actually no women at Imperial. Just
take a look around- see?
Stuff Imperial students like:
1. Lagers:
This is mainly directed at our new
‘recruits’, as everyone else will al-
ready know all about the fun that
can be had whilst one, two or ten
beers are down. Before we go on,
the Health Centre will have prob-
ably slipped a form into your fresher
packs and one question will be ‘How
many units of alcohol do you drink
a week?’. You drink 21, no more. Ac-
cept this.
There are many places to secure
a lager in London, but by far the
cheapest is the Union- go there
(we exclude The Goose on North
End Road as you will probably be
involved in a bar fight at closing).
Personally, I am attached to Tuborg
at the moment, 10p more than Fos-
ter’s, 0.1% more alcohol content, and
oh yeah, doesn’t taste like a convict’s
piss. If your desire is to be smashed
off your nut for the cheapest pos-
sible price- Blackthorn is what you
want. Now go fill your boots.
That’s a beer being poured

Graphic music dingbats 1,438
Each week your lovely crew here in
felix think up, and construct these
amazingly funny dingbats. Normally
they are based about a popular song
that the office has been pumping out
on our shitty, crackly stereo (take note
Editor). This week is no different.
As usual these are FUCWIT eligible,
all you need to do is send the correct
name and artist for each song to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk. There
will be extra points on offer if you are
able to offer a witty story linking all the
titles. If you feel that you can do bet-
ter, pop down, we are always looking
for helpers, and to be honest my brain
breaks quite often leaving you with
some 60s throwback tunes to contend
with. All the other editors say my mu-
sic is shit. I say that they are shit and
should go and get a STD from a Ger-
man prostitute.
Quote of the Week
felix classic caption competition
After a spectacular flop last year, we
are bringing back the caption com-
petition to try and help us through
the long nights. We will decide which
is the funniest, or which sound like
they were sent in by a hot chick and
award points as we see fit. If you turn
to the next page you’ll find all there is
to know about FUCWIT, points and
more importantly, those iPods you get
for winning. So start being funny and
amuse us. Or not as the case may be.
