Got any problems? Needy
McNeedy has exactly three
solutions, just for you, xoxox
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I broke up with my boyfriend before
starting uni, I didn’t want to be tied
down with all this sausage around.
Unfortunately I didn’t get the blob
this month and it turns out that I’m
pregnant, probably by him. Help!
What do I do?
Fat Slag
Dear Fat Slag,
Uhhh contraception? With condoms,
the pill and all manner of baby-stop-
ping devices available nowadays, you
must have about half a brain cell if you
got preggers. But now that you’ve got
into this mess there are only three pos-
sible things that you can do.
Only three!
1. Be a mature human being and tell
him immediately, he has a right to
know. You should make a decision to-
gether about what path you’re going
to take, whether to keep the baby. You
should get your parents involved also
and remember, if you decide to keep the
baby, the uni has a great support struc-
ture so don’t be afraid to get in contact
them.
2.Don’t be a mature human being, keep
the baby a secret, don’t tell anyone!
Hide the bump by wearing baggy, over-
sized clothes and then when the baby is
born, throw it in a dumpster. That way
no-one will ever, ever know...
3.You might not like this one, walk up to
the top floor of your halls, stand at the
edge of the staircase and then get a close
friend to push you. It’s either that or a
gag and a coathanger. It’s 100% safe, I
promise...
Love,
Needy McNeedy. x
Dear Needy McNeedy,
Moving to Imperial was a big step
for me, but I was always sure that I
would be o.k. if I had my pet Gerbil
Billy with me. But my halls have a no
pets policy, I don’t know if I can live
without Billy, who will I turn to for
emotional support? Is there anyway
I can bring him to uni?
Concerned Gerbil Owner
Dear Concerned Gerbil Owner,
You look to your pet gerbil for emotion-
al support? And who the fuck owns a
gerbil anyway, you’re almost an adult,
try getting a girlfriend/boyfriend, or
better yet, a friend full-stop. Or at the
very minimum and umaginary friend.
I think there are bigger problems here
but if you must bring Billy, you do have
some options.
1. Gerbils are pretty small, or at least
that’s what I remember from when I
was 12 years old. It wouldn’t be very
difficult to hide a gerbil in your room,
whenever the cleaner comes to your
room just put the cage under your bed.
As long as you make sure it doesn’t es-
cape and kill someone, there won’t be
any problems.
2. Buy a pair of dark glasses, a walking
stick and a leash for your gerbil. All you
have to do is pretend to be blind and
claim that you own a guide gerbil. If
anyone calls you out, get really indig-
nant and shout “RACIST!”
3. Don’t stand for this infringment on
your human right to be pathetic! If the
wardens demand that you get rid of Bil-
ly, stab them in the face, there won’t be
any negative consequences, I promise...
Love,
Needy McNeedy. x
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I’ve been making loads of friends
since I arrived at Imperial, I even
met some medics in Hackney at a
warehouse party. What a coinci-
dence I thought! I later found out
that they’re in the mafia and not at
Imperial at all, they’ve been asking
me to ‘work’ for them, I’m pretty
scared, what do I do?
Naive and Scared
Dear Naive and Scared,
I don’t know if you’ve ever talked to
anybody at this corporate shithole of a
university but for the future remember
this, nobody at Imperial goes to ware-
house parties in Hackney, except may-
be Alex Ashford, she just might be cool
enough. Back to your problem, don’t
worry; there are three ways out.
1. Cut off all contact with these people,
change your number if neccessary. If
they don’t get the message and continue
to harass you, call the police.
2. You need to man the fuck up, this is
a golden opportunity to make some se-
rious moulah. Meet up with them and
repeat these words, “Tell me what to do
and I’ll do it”. Don’t worry about going
to hell, it doesn’t exist.
3. Let’s face it, these people are gang-
sters and from my vast experience of
the criminal underworld, these guys are
usually arseholes. They’re not going to
leave you alone, so we’re going to have
to do something drastic and by “we”,
I mean YOU and by “drastic” I mean
stab them repeatedly in the face. There
won’t be any negative consequences, I
promise...
Love,
Needy McNeedy. x
