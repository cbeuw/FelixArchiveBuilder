I
’m going to be honest and say
that I started off Freshers with a
lot of apprehension. After shed-
ding a few tears and seeing my
beloved family drive into the
distance, I dragged my way to the solid
Beit hall feeling more than nervous. I
thought that I wasn’t clever enough to
fit in with the stereotypical Imperial
nerds. I’d chosen to study Physics on a
whim and I hadn’t even finished read-
ing A Brief History of Time! But I was
definitely no party animal either. I’d
never been to a club, or had much ex-
perience of drinking (it suffices to say
in the coming weeks I made up for lost
time, and then some).
But it turns out that my fears were
unwarranted. I clearly wasn’t the only
frightened person at the Mingle, with
many others looking awkward and
asking the tedious questions, “so what
subject are you studying? What A lev-
els did you do?...”
And in my case, the Fresher’s Week
events weren’t the best way to meet
people anyway. I found the communal
kitchen, with its unique - albeit slightly
scientific - banter and daily soap op-
eras a far better place for this. I will
warn you now that you should guard
your cutlery, pots, pans and food with
your life.
I found people that I
got along with, and soon
enough I was making the
weekly right of passage
(that is envied by no one
with a decent taste in
music): Tiger Tiger on
Monday, Sway on Tues-
day, Cheapskates on
Wednesday, On Anon
(and on, and on, and
on) on Thursday, gar-
nished with many a
diabolical night at
the Union. I look
back and marvel
at how I was able
to make it to 9am
lectures at all, nev-
er mind hangover
free.
Which takes me
to the academic
side of things. I
came to Imperial
with the assumption
that a Physics degree
wouldn’t be too hard.
After all, I’d managed
A levels OK, and I was
most definitely going to
spend my time studying into the night,
every night, and achieve the zenith of
academic greatness. Somewhere not
too far along the line, that plan failed.
Which isn’t to say I regret it at all;
Freshers shouldn’t be about spending
all your time in the library, and cram-
ming still works for first year exams,
sort of.
You’ve probably heard it before, but
being a Fresher is a once in a lifetime
opportunity. By the time you make sec-
ond year you’ll be wishing you didn’t
take it for granted. And so, my dewy,
bright-eyed Freshers, enjoy it while
you can!

“I was making

I
feel like mourning fresherdom.
Looking back on my Fresher
year, the somewhat recent
memory feels like looking back
on a lifetime of union events,
embroiled with snake bites, hazey
walks back through Hyde Park and
struggling to decipher unfamiliar bus
maps. The initial Fresher experience at
Imperial is quite overwhelming. Firstly
you have to deal with the interestingly
international and “studious” comple-
ment of personalities in your halls,
then later go to some massive student
club, dressed in nothing but neon,
and get hilariously plastered. This is
all good fun for the first week, which
luckily is just enough time before lec-
tures start. That’s when it starts to get
really tough. Get used to going to lec-
tures at ridiculous o’clock, aimlessly
finding your way through what will
soon be a noxiously familiar campus.
Those first few weeks will be physically
hard. So stock up on vitamins, red bull,
soap and tinned food; and with luck
you will survive.
I remember turning up to Ministry
of Sound and the DJ announcing that
Imperial had arrived, recognising the
usual male mob of fearful, spectacle-
bearing, fresh faces. Hence “Impe-
rial” can be used descriptively; if used
against an unfortunate garment you’re
wearing, you might want to avoid
wearing it outside the campus gates.
I would heavily recommend joining
a society. I failed this year, purely due
to my own preoccupancy with friends,
liquid intoxicants and learning how to
get by. There are so many societies at
Imperial, so maybe go in with some
intent, discipline and an open mind.
It’s a sure way to make friends outside
of the compulsory halls/course circle.
The Union nights can be good, as long
as you go with the right expectations.
No doubt you will be aware of the
HUGELY disproportionate sex ratio,
which does cause quite a lot of ani-
mosity between boys and girls. How-
ever resentment is the wrong way to
go. None of us wanted it is this way.
If you’re searching for a girl, don’t
get disheartened if everything is a bit
dry. There are many options like join-
ing a society, meeting those on your
course and halls, and perhaps consider
branching out of Imperial.
If you’re looking for a boy, take your
pick. But don’t forget the infamous Im-
perial motto: “the odds are good, but
the goods are odd”. Personally I think
the odder the better, but this may be a
matter of opinion, so see above.
Academically you are likely to be
pushed, so prepare by having a LOT of
fun being a Fresher, but eventually at
some far off point in the future you will
have to work hard.
Finally, try to avoid being drawn into
the Imperial bubble, remember where
you are. Maybe make a mental list of
things you want to do, see and hear this
year. It’s good to make the most of be-
ing in central London, a rare luxury for
a student and is one of Imperial’s many
perks.
Despite some of my honest allusions,
I am strangely jealous. Good luck!
