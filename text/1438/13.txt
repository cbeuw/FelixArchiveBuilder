Hopefully if you’ve found this guide you are already
intending to come to Freshers’ Fair or are at least curious
to know a bit more about it. In essence Freshers’ Fair
is the Student Union’s biggest event to showcase all of
the Clubs & Societies here at Imperial, of which there
are about 300. What this translates to on the day is a
hectic, exciting, bustling bazaar of almost everything
extracurricular that you hope to see at University.
My advice to anyone going to Freshers’ Fair for the first
time is to keep an open mind. One of the best things
about coming to University is the doors that are opened
to you, and one of them is certainly the variety of things
that are available to do and get involved in. For one thing,
during your time here you are likely to be able to try things
out for the cheapest it will ever be until you qualify for
your pension. It’s likely that there will be things that you
are already interested in, and by all means if there is a
club for it, seek it out and join up. But its also worth taking
the time to wander around to see if there is anything else
that takes your fancy. Given the number and diversity of
Clubs & Societies, there is something for everyone going
on at any time of day or any day of the week so it’s not
uncommon to be a member of more than one club and
still leave time for your studies.
Each location on this guide contains clubs that are
grouped broadly according to what it is they do so have
a look for what you are roughly looking for and its likely
that there might be other clubs close by that could also
tempt you. Most clubs will be holding a taster session
for free or reduced price in the first couple of weeks of
term while your workload isn’t too overwhelming so its
good to ask about these and sign up to any mailing lists
to find out when and where it will all be happening as you
are by no means signing away your soul by doing this.
Quite often if you’re finding it hard to decide which club
to join from a couple its worth going along to a taster of
each of them as the deciding factor can just be a case
of where you find the most people you get along with.
Once you have decided, it’s never to late to join and you
can become a member at any point in the year either by
getting in contact with the club or looking them up on
imperialcollegeunion.org.
The last thing to mention is other things going on around
campus. Throughout the day there will be a stage on the
Queens Lawn where many of the performing clubs will
be showing off the amazing things they do in addition to
being a good excuse for a rest. Also don’t forget to pop
over to Beit Quad to check out the clubs located here, the
Union stall and INFO stand and Da Vinci’s bar, which will
be selling food and drink throughout the day in case you
get peckish. As if that wasn’t enough we’ll be finishing
off the day with the Freshers’ Fair Afterparty taking
place in Beit Quad which is a great chance to kick back
and relax after a busy day and talk to many of the people
already involved in Clubs & Societies with a line up of live
performances from our dance, martial arts, musical and
cultural Clubs & Societies all in the Union Marquee.
