2 felix FRIDAY 02 OCTOBER 2009
I
’ve just realised that every pic-
ture you’ve seen of me I abso-
lutely despise. The official photo
that is used in the Freshers’
Handbook suggests that I’m in
an all-grinning state of creepy happi-
ness. I have never smiled like that in
my life, and the momentary second I
do so, they decide to take a photo and
plaster it all over the Union. Don’t even
get me started on the one above.
If my face hasn’t put you off enough
to immediately and permanently erase
it from your memory, you should defi-
nitely come harass me when you see
the fugly thing around College. But
enough about my questionable face.
You’ll see felix released across Col-
lege every Friday in the arm-achingly
numerous distribution bins. It’s all
part of a big game-plan, you see. If Fri-
days weren’t good enough because the
weekend’s staring you right in the face,
you also get your favourite newspaper
to read. Or, pick it up during the week
and let it consume a boring lecture.
The Coffee Break section has been sci-
entificually proven to relieve tutorial-
induced boredom.
Now let me introduce you to the a
couple of the important people helping
me make this newspaper thoroughly
second-rate. The bastards.
There’s the two Deputy Editors, both
Physicists, Kadhim and Gilead. Ka-
dhim has recently been travelling and
like most travellers has returned with

TEH
WEEK
CHECK IT! I’m the Top Cat!
Aww, lame...
DanWan Editor-in-Chief
a ‘newfound sense of life’. This has so
far only lead to growth of a remarkably
suspect moustache. Despite the habi-
tat that has colonised his upper lip, I’m
sure he has plenty of insights to share
with us over the coming year in his
combined roles of Deputy, News and
Music Editor.
Gilead has just stumbled straight off
the BBC set of University Challenge
where he captained the Imperial Col-
lege team. Whilst he may be receiving
tongue-lashings from Jeremy Paxman,
Gilead has just as a sharp-witted mind,
longside a vocabulary so extensive it
puts the Oxford English Dictionary to
shame. Read his Comment piece this
week to see the substance behind the
claims.
The rest of the team consists of an
eclectic and entertaining mix of lads
and lasses. Each of them contributes
however much they can, entirely vol-
untarily every week. They balance
their degree with working for felix, and
a lot of the time the two things become
equal priority. However, as enthusias-
tic as people can get, I have always said
that your degree should always come
first. Hence, I understand when peo-
ple can’t commit to any articles for the
period of their exams or dissertations.
It is their entirely choice though, and
I am always extremely grateful to see
different individuals walk through the
door into the office. I’m equally excited
to see familiar faces enter as I am new
ones. If you find yourself thinking you
want to write for felix, I think I’ve made
it very clear you’re welcome to see us in
the office for a chat and a pint. Alter-
natively, just email us your thoughts at
the moderately simple address felix@
imperial.ac.uk.
The people involved in felix provide
the office with a unscientific, stimulat-
ing and playful atmosphere that is rare
at Imperial. The differences in music
taste, opinion and perspective bring
healthy debate to the surface; espe-
cially on Wednesday evenings when
the print deadline is looming and the
office is packed with writers turning
in their articles and pages. It is one of
many things about being involved with
felix that has been the saving grace of
Imperial College. I nearly quit Imperial
in my first year, disillusioned with my
course and what I was actually trying to
achieve at this university. When I think
back to the moment I had my phone in
my hand, and the number to Imperial
College Registry dialled; then com-
pare it to the moment I became felix
Editor, I can only thank everyone who
persuaded me to stay at Imperial to
stick it out, and to get a grip on actually
achieving something. And that is why
felix means so much to me, and why
I am striving to make this year’s felix
the best ever. I can only hope felix be-
comes something that means as much
to you as it now means to me.
It’s really your paper after all.
