coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk COFFEE BREAK
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number of lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be one
continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.
Slitherlink 1,438
Wordoku 1,438
Generic Solution
So, we couldn’t drop the Wor-
doku could we? Where else
do you get a PORNFEAST or
KNOBJUICE? Nowhere, that’s
where. Well, expect the usual
mix of solely childish words that
will make you chuckle inside.
Scribble box
Going underground
This was a great invention from last
year, combining maths, local knowledge
and a great way to waste time into one
easily understandable format. Often in
the past, this game gets cocked up, but
do not despair all will change this year.
It’s an easy one this week.
B A N K

28
= 2+1+14+11=28. Job done.
So which London tube station sums to 127?
_ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Mentalist maze...
It’s a maze you fucwit. Do it, then send
the answer in. I am tired and want to
go home so here is some placeholder
text: Untur as a nonseque entis sitiis
molore solupta veremporum ipitio
omnihit dolectur ratus.
Explabo. Ut ea velia veligent dolum-
quae sin pa es nobitas at eatus.
Generic Solution
Hokay so, this is the slitherlink, it is
amazing. You should give it a go. Have
a gander at the generic solution to get
an idea of how things work then have
a go at the one on the left. Answer to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk

Nonogram 1,438
How to play:
Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells
in a grid have to be coloured or left blank ac-
cording to numbers at the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many unbroken
lines or filled-in squares there are in any given
row or column. Look at the solution for help.
These are Nonograms. They are beyond me,
but some people manage to do them, and
better still get them correct! If you are one of
these people, then go ahead, get completing,
scanning and sending!

ay hi to your new Puzzles
Editor, Ewan Quince (I’m
not writing in the third per-
son, he’s too lazy to come to
the felix office, Charlie’s onto
it). However Indian papers on a re-
cent Hockey tour reported his name
as Quinee, so take your pick. He’s a big
lad, so if you have any beef with him,
best to take it up with the Editor-In-
Chief, Dan Wan. He’s a brittle chap. No
idea exactly what he has in store for you
as he is yet to burrow his way down to
West Wing basement, but it’ll be good.
Here’s a fact about Quinee: around his
neck he wares a dog tag. Not because
he’s double hard, or because he used
to be in the army. One side is inscribed
with the name of his girlfriend, and the
other the date that they started going
out. Thoughts to the usual address.
Right, I believe he has lots of fun puz-
zles and games in store for you this
year, so keep your eyes peeled for new
inventions to get those elusive ipods.
ipods?!? ipods you say? Well, yes fresh-
ers, each year we host a FUCWIT (Fac-
ulty/College/Union Wide Intelligence
Table) league, offering points to the
team who manages to complete a puz-
zle and send it to coffee.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk. All puzzles and games are
eligible for points, and the team/person
(there are two leagues) at the top of the
table come end of the year, are declared
winners. For all you freshers out there,
if you use a college printer, you can scan
directly to email and then forward the
scanned file onto us.
Basically you are going to do these
puzzles bored in lectures, so send the
answer in and get ipods. Simples.
You are all
FUCWITs
