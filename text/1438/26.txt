place in league 2A.
Moving away from the leaguue ta-
ble, our table tennis players have per-
formed incredibly this year in a tough
league and cup. Finishg 3rd place in
BUCS division 1A, finishing behind
Brunel and Middlesex (two sports-
intensive universities) is not bad an
achievement. The highlight of the their
year was winning the BUCS Trophy in
Sheffield, beating York 9-7.
Whereas the ICSM (Medicals) net-
ball teams have been performing ex-
tremely well, the IC ladies have had,
to put it simply, a diabolical season.
Their 1st team didn’t win a match and
as a club they came bottom of our very
own table. So calling all college ladies,
if you play netball, do not be put off,
the team can only improve. In fact it
will be more of an effort to do worse
than last year!
For the last two years the Imperial
Squash Club have been performing to
a very high standard, with the men’s 1st
team winning promotion for two years
on the trot. Do not be afraid of this,
however, as the club is open to anyone
an they cater to all levels of ability.
As you can see, there are a lot of
sports on offer apart from the big
three; hockey, football and rugby. But
how did they all do last year? Looking
at the league table, Imperial hockey
Men’s 1st team are the only ones that
made it into the top ten (just to let you
know, there are 60 teams in total that
participate in the league). In stark con-
trast, the bottom ten had five teams
from the ‘big three’. It is safe to say
that the clubs are looking to improve
their performance this season, and of
course, they do cater for the experi-
enced and novice players alike.
One other thing that you should
probably realise sooner rather than
later is that there is a fair bit of rivalry,
mainly between the Medics and Col-
lege teams. This rivalry culminates in
the annual Varsity sporting event in
late February with the spectacle be-
ing the rugby men’s 1st teams battling
it out at Richmond Athletics Club in
front of a crowd of roughly 1,500 stu-
dents and staff.
Each year the event gets bigger and
better, and the afterparty is one of the
highlights of the year, so make sure
you keep 17th March 2010 free and
come along for some banter and a fun
evening. There will even be the now
annual ‘The Rival’ magazine published
soon after Varsity, giving you a com-
prehensive round up of all the results.
Oh and if there are any rowers out
there, I’m not sure how to put this to
you, but we’re good... Really good.
World class in fact. But just like all the
other sports, they cater for the novices,
so if it tickles your fancy, give it a go.
Finally, apart from remembering
to bring your kit with you to the first
week, you must also remember to set
a side some money to actually join the
clubs. Membership can be bought on-
line at www.imperialcollegeunion.org/
clubs-and-societies so make sure you
pay the membership now before you
spend it all in the bar.
Whatever club you join, you’re
bound to find a great bunch of people
and your time will be better spent at
Imperial. So get stuck in and look out
for the ACC bar nights which are going
to be entertaining.
These guys were amazing last year. Who knows, you can replicate such successes this year if you commit to Table Tennis.
