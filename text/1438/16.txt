What’s the worse thing
you’ve done whilst off
your face?

FRESHERS HAD TO SAY BEFORE THEY ARRIVED.

This honestly could just be an old mannequin, but we’ve been told
its a trolleyed Fresher getting used to the streets of London. Quite
literally.
Messy Freshers’ Week? We’d love to
see the results. Please? Email your
photos to catnip.felix@imperial.ac.uk

We’re just so very
jealous of you......

at The Mingle. Even if you don’t remem-
ber me, I’ll definitely remember you.
Mike Robson, 3rd Year Biochemist
Don’t kid yourself. It doesn’t get any
better.
Alex Ashford, 3rd Year Biologist
To all the international students: yes,
you should have gone to New York
University.
Carlos Karingal, 3rd Year Maths
Don’t worry, it’s only three years and
you’re outta here.
Ravi Pall, 3rd Year Physics
Fresher’s Week was when I finally came
out of my shell. I was thrown into a
world of amazing people who were just
as crazy and excitable as I wanted to be.
It was the first time I truly felt free.
Chris Fosenka, 2nd Year Mech Eng
You kids better be cool.
Felix the Cat
A guide to the morning after:
1. Check you haven’t passed out in the
road.
2. Check for blood.
3. If blood is present, check if it’s yours.
4. Locate where you stripped and left
clothes.
5. Drink 5 pints of water. (N.B. These
must be downed or taken in shot form).
6. Check phone for drunk texts/phone
calls.
7. Check phone/ Facebook for pictures
of what happened.
8. Ask sober people what happened. If
there were no sober people, nice work!
9. Check if the rest of the crew died/
got laid (probably the first one).
10. Check you haven’t been evicted.
11. Make sure you didn’t go to A&E/
get arrested/ start a fire/ get set on
fire.
12. Check for cones/ Bus Stops/
Christmas lights/ traffic lights/ jelly.
13. Find out who carried you home.
14. Go to KFC, eat a bucket of
chicken.
15. Locate any remaining alcohol.
16. Get fucking wasted!
The Pre Lash Crew
Southside ‘08/09
Got smashed and danced like a tard
with hired belly dancers, got recorded,
and humiliated on Facebook next
day...
Dushyant Goordyal
One time I got so drunk I was crawling
round my friends house (I couldn’t
walk) and got carried home by my
friend’s mum and my mum in some
random guys size 11 shoes :S oops!
Rosalind Gisbey
Entering a karaoke competition
in Ecuador and trying to sing ‘Sex
Bomb’... I only knew the words to the
chorus.
James McEntee
Yanked a club bouncers trousers down
(then ran for my life).
Chintan Khamar
The first time I got drunk was at a
friends house party, and I threw up in
every single room in the house. From
downstairs in the kitchen, to upstairs
in the attic. EVERY.SINGLE.ROOM.
There was also a DJ there, and I kinda
WHAT SOME OF THE OLDIES HAVE SAID.....
At Freshers’ Roadshow, I found
myself on stage and was presented
with an almost naked man. The
task was to stick six anatomical
labels onto the right part of his
body. As if by reflex, I put all the
labels onto him in less than 5
seconds and our team won. It was
glorious!
Loretta Ko, 5th Year Medic
threw up all over his equipment, after
which I passed out where everyone
threw their coats....And then woke
up and threw up on their coats.
Thankfully, I don’t remember any of
it. I’ve been much more careful since
then. I haven’t thrown up since!!
Iman Saida
Had around 25 cans of Strongbow
whilst camping, I tripped over a chair
and fell through the wall of a gazebo.
Later that night I gave my friend, at
his request, scars like the Joker in the
Dark Knight movie. It was a seriously
crazy night!

Apparently, I once started a tiramisu
fight in a restaraunt- never drinking
that much wine again! Had to pay for
the dry cleaning of someone’s new
coat.
Lauren Chalmers, 5th Year Medic
I vomited bubbles when doing RAG
Centurian. Not vomit. Bubbles.
