We are at Imperial, but these crosswords are
not meant to be so fucking hard that your
brain explodes on viewing them. If that is
your desire I suggest you look for a cryptic
one on the back page. Or root out a copy of
The Times. These are actually quite simple.
Answers to the usual address.

Cancer
You’ve started Uni life
at Imperial, the love
of your life is up in
Glasgow. You promise
to stay faithful, that you
will marry and have
grotty kids. Oh do fuck off. You’ll stay faithful
because there’s fields of cock here, wait, I’ll check.
Yep, no clunge. Her on the other hand is probably
up to gag reflex in Scottish hockey players. Face
facts son, she’s gone. Go jump off Tower Bridge.
Virgo
Traditionally Virgo
was generally a nice
Horoscope. Being in
the middle of the page
and after splaffing out
seven paragraphs of
extreme anger, a more lassier faire incite into the
world was in order. Well that’s all change now. If
you’ve got an issue, come down here to felix, and
risk having to drag yourself back up the stairs after
you’ve had you kneecaps removed.
Gemini
Who the fuck are all
these twats in the
Union? Please sod
off out the bar, and if
you really do need to
vomit, for your own
personal safety do not vomit in my vicinity.
If you do happen to bust out a techinicolour
yawn anywhere, literally anywhere near me, I
will punch the spleen out of you. Go back to
Secondary School and wedgie the class retard.
Pisces
Think I started off
wrong there. I apolo-
gise if I come across
as an angry, drunk,
mentalist. Given a hug
or kiss I am fully capa-
ble of putting my initial disgust of other humans
to one side. But only if you’re a pretty blond girl.
So, if you are looking for a Ox/Horse/Olympic
athlete cross (I’ll let you work out what attributes
go where) drop the cat phone a text. Kisses.
Leo
Is it acceptable to
stab you room-mate
if the colon with an
HB pencil? I am going
with yes. It’s not that
he’s foreign or a right
shit lad. More that he fucking stinks. You have
tried to politely sniff the air and ask him if he has
brought a dismembered rabbit into the room, he
says he doesn’t think so. Fuck it, nothing left to
do but sharpen up the HB.
Aries
As this is the first
week of a new term
for all us oldies out
there, we all know
that means one thing.
Fresh poon. You will
dream about wallowing in this ‘poon’ casually
tossing the second grade meat to Sci-Fi Soc.
Don’t kid yourself. There will be no poon, only
men, spotty, adolescent, grimy 18 year olds. I
hate you all, don’t even think of spilling my pint.
Scorpio
I fucking love a good
Scorpio lad. For that is
what they are, proper
good lads. We can
drink, talk, act like a
gentleman and look
cool all at the same time. Many of us drive pow-
erful Ducati sports bikes, because, well, we can.
Don’t worry though, we also have some beautiful
pop-pop classic Lambretta scooters to pose on.
These are only some of our qualities. Kisses.
Libra
Oh fuck! You haven’t
been at university
for 24 hours and you
already have chronic
knob-rot. Don’t know
whether to high-five
you for shagging that dirty slapper, or to keep
as far away from you as possible... for the same
reason. Lets be certain about this... it’s fresher’s
week, so use you gift, even if that gift is knob-rot.
Why go down on your own?
Taurus
Contrary to the Ar-
ies, there will actually
be one woman, Sun-
shine. You meet in
dB’s, take her home
and rodger the life
out of her. Come morning she has left, initially
a good thing, but your wallet, phone and for
some reason you back catalogue of Phil Collins’
hits has been taken. Fuck. Worse still you have
a severe burning sensation when you piss.
Capricorn
Who the fuck do you
think you are little
fresher boy? Come over
here taking our jobs,
drinking my beers. Why
don’t you put your penis
between your legs and run back to where ever the
fuck you come from because you’re sure as hell not
wanted here. I really hope that you trip over as you
run and face plant the floor. Better still, go for a cliff
walk and fall off the top. Now fuck off. Pint?
Aquarius
Hi. Welcome fresher.
Please come in, don’t
be shy. Here take this
pint. Drink fresher,
fucking drink it.
Good. Here try this
pill. Yes, you munch that pill like it’s a Smartie.
How does that feel? Good? Are you enjoying
yourself little boy. Your anus loose? You better
hope it is or you’ll be walking like a penguin for
a week. Yes, you’ve been brutally gay raped.

Sagittarius
Why doesn’t Lady Gaga,
the hermaphrodite that
she is just fuck off and
get tangled in one of
her stupid outfits, fall
over and gouge her
ovaries out? If I happened to be walking down a
street and she was being heavily gang raped, I, well
I wouldn’t join in, I’m not a rapist. Fuck no. But I
might confiscate any lube that happens to be lying
around. Might shit on her head too actually.
Seen that special
person? Could be
the one? Want to
see them again?
Text Lovestruck
to get a free union
lunch together!
“You, girl in the Union, Monday at
3.30pm ordering a Gin and Tonic
with a lemon. Barman didn’t un-
derstand. I have big lemons want a
squirt of them.?”
Tall guy in ICHC hoody
“You were passed out in the
Quad after exams last year. Your
eyeballs had sunken to the back
of your head. That’s really hot. I’d
like to meet you in the same state.
”
R. O’Hipnoll, 2nd Year Biology
“I saw you leave the RSM, you fell
down the steps and face planted
the floor. I pissed myself laughing.
Should have offered to rub you
better. Too late?”
Girl in black stilettos
“Mark, we spoke in the Union on
Monday, you said you would ring
but never have! Same place same
time?”
Amanda the American
“You: so hot that you didn’t need
and umbrella in the rain as
you walked past the library on
Wednesday at 4pm. Me: falling off
my chair. You laughed. Can I make
you scream with joy?”
