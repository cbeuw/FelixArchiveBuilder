W
ell done! If you’re
reading this, you’re
probably a Fresher,
so have successfully
made it to Imperial
College. You’ll have overcome revision,
exams, traffic congestion and parking
wardens to have made it into halls,
or braved public
transport to commute in. You should
have seen the Union’s handbook by
now – if not, drop by reception on
level 2M of the Union building in Beit
and pick one up. I won’t begin to cover
the same topics, as it would start to get
repetitive!
It’s been good to talk to many of you
on Facebook, espe-
cially as one of
the conversa-
tions provided
inspiration for
this column. I
was asked “do
you want to
go into poli-
tics?”, which
got me think-
ing about
the different
ways people
might view a
students’ union. Is it a place where you
go to socialise? A place which organis-
es recreational activities? Somewhere
to go for help? A place where people
stand around with placards shout-
ing? Or a breeding ground for people
to climb the greasy pole of politics?
A students’ union can be all of those
things, but Imperial College Union
does some of those more than others.
We’re sometimes seen as fairly odd
(as a Union, not as people, although
some might say otherwise), because we
spend lots of money on clubs and tend
not to go on massive rants about things
which don’t affect our students.
The Union is a great place to social-
ise without breaking the bank– our
bars are open throughout the week
serving food and drink, and our aim
is to give you a venue which provides
a good service and value for money.
We’ll also be raising money during the
year to extensively refurbish our bars,
and we’ll want your input.
We don’t tend to go around waving
placards and shouting through mega-
phones, or pretending that we’re the
United Nations (we have societies that
do that, if you want to). Imperial is
home to such a diverse set of people,
with so many different opinions, that
as a Union we try to stay apolitical, but
have clubs for different political and
philosophical viewpoints. We spend a
lot of time and money on clubs, which
provide for a huge range of activities.
Make use of the subsidy while you can!
We are certainly a place to come for
help. We sit on lots of College commit-
tees to represent your views, but also
have extensive contacts throughout
the College and beyond with which to
try and solve any problems you might
encounter. As a Fresher, these will
probably revolve around money, jobs
and accommodation for a while, be-
fore moving on to exam stress and the
like. If we don’t know how to help, we’ll
know someone who can.
All of that was a long way of answer-
ing “no, not really” to the “do you want
to go into politics?” question. Politics
for the sake of politics isn’t the focus
of what we do. A lot of what we do is
politics, of course: negotiating with
the College when students want some-
thing changed, trying to find a com-
promise between opposing views etc
etc etc. But our focus is on students,
so make sure you tell us what you want
your Union to do.
(OK, I might have lied a bit and cov-
ered some of the same ground as the
handbook. In the first ‘real’ issue of fe-
lix I’ll talk a bit about what we’re plan-
ning to do in the coming year, which
certainly won’t be like the handbook.
Probably.)

I
f you’re anything like me then
you’re Jewish, 6 ft 2”, in desper-
ate need of a shave and are cur-
rently struggling to type a 700-
word article on somebody else’s
MacBook. Chances are, of course, that
you’re not like me - something which
I’m sure comes as quite a relief to both
of us. One thing we do have in com-
mon, however, is that we are now both
students at the same university. And
that, like it or not, makes you twice as
likely to be male as female. This may
be something of a surprise to those of
you who have never previously had any
reason to doubt your gender, but I’m
afraid there’s no arguing with statis-
tics. Only one out of every three stu-
dents is going to be a woman, but see-
ing as I belong to the sex that grows to
6 ft 2” and ends up desperately needing
shaves, the odds have evened them-
selves out pretty well for you.
To be fair, these numbers don’t mean
very much. By far the more important
piece of information is that one in eve-
ry four of you will come from a land
beyond the confines of what we have
come to know and love as the Euro-
pean Union. In other words, you are
currently sitting on a bed inside a hall
of residence belonging to the second
most multicultural university in the
country. Unless, of course, you hap-
pen to have broken with tradition and
taken this copy of felix out beyond the
confines of your room, in which case I
salute your intrepid spirit.
The tremendous variation in nation-
ality - and slightly less tremendous
variation in gender - can make life at
Imperial a bit confusing. Which is a lit-
tle like saying that fish and chips with
peas can taste a bit like fish and chips.
Your lives were like skeins of wool in
a lion enclosure long before you came
to university, and I hope for your sake
they remain that way for many years
after. It’s fairer to say that the time you
spend at Imperial will be like a par-
ticularly intense game of Monopoly: it
may well take you a few years to finish,
it will cost you a considerable amount
of money, you will spend endless hours
going over the same, familiar streets,
and unless you’re very careful you
could well end up in jail. More than
that, it will prove at one and the same
time exciting, excruciating, exhausting
and exhilarating, and you can win if
you know the rules.
That has been the point of the threat-
ening reams of paper that have been
rammed into your mailbox, left in wait
on your bed in halls, and thrust into
your terrified hands since you first de-
cided Imperial was a good place to go
once Oxbridge had turned you down.
And yet, despite the noble causes that
those trees died to promote, may I con-
gratulate you on turning to felix. Well
done, and thank you. Thank you, thank
you, thank you. For it is here, in this pa-
per, that you learn the rules. The forms
and inventories, insurance claims and
telephone bills, classwork and exer-
cises currently covering your bed will
usually do little more than turn you
into a panicking cat’s cradle of nerves.
Now is the perfect opportunity to take
a break and give yourself some time.
If the words ‘Don’t Panic’ were good
enough for the Megadodo publish-
ing corporation in the constellation of
Ursa Minor, and by extension for the
Earth-author Douglas Adams, then
they are certainly good enough for us.
As a final note, somewhere in your
room you should find a small multi-
coloured cardboard box meant to
serve as a goody bag-cum-survival
kit. Among other things, this box will
contain a single, flavoured, condom.
Remember its flavour and treasure this
nugget of information carefully. Like
a loveable medic friend of mine (who
has, fortunately, since found his true
calling) you can pin it to your wall as a
decoration, or you can use it as a topic
of conversation when the names and
course details of your interlocutors
have already been said and instantly
forgotten. In my first week, the ques-
tion ‘what flavour was your condom?’
earned me as many welcome laughs as
it did confused expressions. Of course,
you may in your youthful brilliance
invent yet another function for the of-
fending object. You freshers will never
cease to amaze me.
