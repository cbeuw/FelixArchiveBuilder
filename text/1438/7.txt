Omelettes are one of those things that every student should learn to cook (as long as you like
eggs) because it’s quick, cheap and on balance a pretty healthy meal. It’s also one of those few
meals that’s easier to cook for one. It can be eaten plain but it’s often what you put in it that makes
it. Serve with salad to again get your fruit and veg total topped-up.
Time: Less than 10 minutes
Cost: 60p- £1 depending on topping
Ingredients: • 2-3 eggs, depending on how hungry you are
• Small knob of butter
• Salt and pepper
Method: Break the eggs into a bowl and add salt and pepper. Break up with a fork but do not whisk or beat
them. Place a frying pan on the highest heat and melt the butter, tipping the pan to cover the surface. When the butter is frothing, tip in the eggs and
leave for 10 seconds. Tilt the pan, pushing one side of the omelette up so that the runny egg fills the gap, and repeat on the other side. When the egg
is mostly solid, fold it in half and cook for another 10 seconds. When most of the liquid egg has gone, tip onto a plate, folding it in half again and serve
immediately. You can add grated cheese, herbs, cooked bacon or cooked vegetables to the mixture before cooking to add flavour.

Often overlooked by students because of the time it takes to cook them, jacket potatoes are great for
colder nights when you’re too tired or busy to fuss around in the kitchen. As long as you put the potato
in the oven before you’re hungry, you can get on with some study or watching TV while it’s cooking.
Time: 1 hour
Cost: 60p-£1.50 depending on topping
Ingredients: • 1 jacket potato
• Salt
Method: Heat the oven to 180°C. Wash the jacket potato and pierce with a fork a few times so
it doesn’t explode. Rub with some salt and place it in the oven. Medium sized-potatoes will take about
an hour, but to check it’s ready pierce with a knife and it should be soft all the way through. Serve
with melted butter and cheese or beans (or both) or a tuna mix.

Having a poorly-stocked cupboard is one of the key reasons students over-spend on last-minute purchases. One of the best ways to keep costs
down and reduce stress is to plan a bit in advance so you always have something on hand to whip up last minute. Avoid wandering around the
supermarket aimlessly- lists a are frugal cook’s best friend. The following is by no means a comprehensive list, but it’s a start. It means you’ll be
able to make a lot of the meals mentioned above with the purchase of one or two fresh items in some instances. Your freezer should become
your best friend- take advantage of the larger space by freezing larger meals in portion sizes (they’re impossible to split when frozen!). This is
particularly useful for sauces such as tomato sauce and mince.
