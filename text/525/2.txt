PHILLIPS TELLS AMERICAN STUDENTS TO STOP AID TO IRA
American students were told
by National Union of Students
President Trevor Phillips that they
have a duty to step in and stop
people from the United States
donating money to para-military
groups in Northern Ireland.
Mr Phillips told delegates to
the first national conference of the
United States Student Asso-
ciation (USSA) which opened on
Saturday August 11th that there is
no immediate or direct role for the
United States to play in solving
the problem of Northern Ireland
with money forguns or by holding
ill-informed debates in New York.
The 3.5 million strong U S S A
was formed last year after a
m e r g e r b e t w e e n A m e r i c a ' s
National Student Association and
the National Student lobby there.
The conference took place at
the Lincoln campus of the
University of Massachussets in
A m h u r s t . A t h r e e p e r s o n
delegation from N U S have flown
to the United States for the
conference. It is the first time that
there has been any official links
between British and American
student leaders for over ten years.
Accompanying Mr Phillips on
the trip are N U S Vice-President,
Pete Silkin and Stuart Appleton,
the manager of the Union's
I n t e r n a t i o n a l D e p a r t m e n t .
Before flying out of London,
Trevor Phillips said that he hoped
the trip would result in closer links
between officers of the two unions
on matters of common concern
including student grants, youth
unemployment and Southern
Africa.
He said he would be inviting
the U S S A to send a delegate to the
next N U S national conference to
be held in Blackpool in December.
Mr Phillips said he wants the
U S S A and N U S to initiate a joint
campaign on Southern Africa
next spring. This will hopefully
include campaigns in colleges for
disinvestment from firms with
interests in South Africa, the
collection of material aid such as
educational and medical supplies
for liberation movements a n d
pressing for an end to N A T O c o -
o p e r a t i o n w i t h c o u n t r i e s
practising apartheid.
W h i l s t w e w e l c o m e M r s
T h a t c h e r ' s t u r n a b o u t o n
Zimbabwe, N U S has a duty to
keep her on course and the U S S A
should keep the American Senate
in check.
"Both Unions must ensure that
sanctions are not lifted until there
is a settlement which puts power
in the hands of the people", said
Mr Phillips.
O n N o r t h e r n I r e l a n d he
c o m m e n t e d : " A m e r i c a n
politicians should look to sorting
their own problems out. More
people die violently each day in
New York than in Northern
Ireland."
Mr Phillips commenting on the
U S S A conference said: "The
U S S A is the biggest student union
in the western world and N U S is
the best organised and best
developed union in Europe, so we
have much to learn from each
other."

This special Edition
of FELIX has been
printed because there
is a likelyhood that a
court order may be
served which could
stop FELIX being
produced.
The next FELIX was
scheduled for Friday
September 14th. We
still hope to produce
an issue of FELIX on
that date.
Dear Sirs, -1 am writing to you in the
hope that you might be able to help
us. We have searched in vain for part
time teachers of science and
mathematics and we are wondering
if any post-graduate students might
be interested in earning some extra
money. The level of work is 'O' and
below, often very much below. We
need teachers who can express
scientific ideas simply.
Ideally we need people for basic
science on Monday mornings, for
biology on Wednesday mornings
and for mathematics on Thursday
mornings. The optimum would be
for one person to cover all three but
this is not essential.
Teaching conditions are less than
ideal, we would not expect anyone
to take the job without due
consideration and of course we
would need to interview any
candidates to assess their suitability
for our conditions. Anyone who is
interested could ring me on
extension 264 to arrange an
interview. The pay, by the way, for a
two hour session is of the order of
Â£10.
I look forward to hearing from
you.
Yours faithfully,
R.M. Brown
Education Officer
