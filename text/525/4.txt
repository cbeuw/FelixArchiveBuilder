The Quad is gradually
being transformed into the
layout designed more than
two years ago. The original
plans for the redevelopment
were printed in 1977. The
diagram (on the right) was
published in FELIX No. 476,
and we reprint it today to give
you some idea of the final
layout.
The poor old Quad looks
in a bit of a mess at the
moment. Excavations have
left the surface rough and
untidy. It would make a good
film set for N A S A simulations
of moon landings. Our photo
shows the equivalent of the
lunar rover. The machine
eats into the ground and
scrapes up earth samples
which are then piled into
heaps which will form the
base of the raised lawns.

There will be two grass
areas and both will have
trees, in order to improve
drainage. One of the more
aesthetic touches - borders
of floribunda roses - was
dropped from the scheme,
and measures have been
taken to ensure that the
shrubbery that is planted will
be unlikely to tempt people
to try uprooting it.
Holes have been dug to
break through the hard
surface of the old tennis
courts that lie just below the
Quad. This should greatly
improve drainage and will
give the plants and trees a
good chance of survival.
There were originally three
trees in the old Quad but two
died because they 'drowned'
in the water that collected on
top of the tennis courts and
s a t u r a t e d t h e i r r o o t s .
The tree that survived has
served many a purpose in its
time; electioneering can-
didates have been phot-
graphed hanging from it, and
m a n y i n c l u d i n g elected
Presidents on their way
home from the bar, have
made use of it in other ways.
