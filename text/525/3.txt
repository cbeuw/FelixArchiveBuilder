FELIX has made friends with
dozens of the Promenaders,
who patiently sit outside our
offices. The above photo,
taken many hours before the
Saturday Prom, shows the
long queue in Prince Consort
Road that demonstrates the
success of the concerts. This
y e a r ' s H a n d b o o k E d i t o r ,
Derrick Everett, became a
superstar when we placed an
enlarged photo, of him, in the
FELIX office window along
with a suitable caption.

While some of us listened to
the Prom on the Union B a r
radio .... others were inside the
Albert Hall after waiting forfive
hours or more.

May we first say how proud we are to have
been allowed a small space in this amazing
spectical of literary genious. Our man of the
moment is at the present time pounding the
streets (and if he doesn't stop soon his
wrists will ache), gathering info to be placed
hopefully in this and future issues of FELIX as
a punishment for all who read it. The info
mainly is based on problems of both students
and staff (lets face it who else has problems)
and at our expert hands the pen will reap such
superb answers as to stun the likes of
Marjorie Proops and Evelyn Holmes.
Q
Dear Jane,
I've been searching high and low around
London to find a restaurant that produces
scintillating company, diabolical food and
aciduous red wine with bits of cork floating in
it. C a n you help?
A
I see you have a problem here which is
easily solved, may I suggest one of the little
bistros in the IC complex. Hall dinners have
been known to fill all your requirements and
at N O extra charge there is a cabaret
comprising of a long monotonous boring
speech. (How do you spell Computer
anyway).
Q
Dear Jane,
My Computer Science boyfriend is heavily
into Gang Punching. What can I do?
A
Doing things as a group can be fun,
however, sometimes you like to do things on
your own. I suggest you punch him back on
the '029'.
Q
Dear Jane,
I put my tortoise in the oven and
accidently switched on. What can I do?
A
Stuff it (with s a g e a n d o n i o n ) .
If you have a problem send it to:
Jane Landsbury
FELIX
Imperial College Union
Prince Consort Road
London SW7 2BB
If you have a legal problem. She will be glad to
come round and sort you out.
