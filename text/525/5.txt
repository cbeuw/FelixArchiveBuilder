T o coincide neatly with this odd
publication date, I've scrapped together a
m o n t a g e o f t h e c u r r e n t f i l m
releases(misleading titles can, of course, lie
ignored).
F r o m Thursday at the Gate, Notting H i l l ,
you can sample Woody Allen's latest offering
Manhatten. Filmed in black and white and
starring Allen and Diane Keaton(again), it is
another attempt to draw on personal
relationships lor humour. It succeeds
admirably, with Woody Allen stealing the
limelight in his role as a middle aged Jewish
New-Yorker, involved not only with a 17
year o l d girl but also with his friend's
mistress. I found it as funny as any other A l l e n
comedy(this is not Interiors!), but it could be
considered a monochrome extension to
Annie H a l l . This is not a disadvantage. A film
not to be missed.
Also doing well at the moment is Zeffirclli s
The C h a m p . This is the tale of a former
champion boxer (John Voight) who attempts
to make a comeback lor the sake of his young
son (Ricky Schroder). The third player in this
larger than life drama is Faye D u n a w a y who
plays the estranged mother who gave up her
son to become a fashion designer. Through a
series of bleary eyed break-ups and reunions a
fairly interesting story is expanded, but I'd
give this one a miss unless you have a weepy
girl/boyfriend and a good supply of tissues.
Currently London's biggest money spinner
is the new Bond thriller Moonraker. A
mixture of spy story, exotic locations a n d
gadgetry, it sticks closely to the long
established Bond formula. I consider it a
blend ol most of the recent films, with the re-
appearance of " J a w s " (Richard Kiel) further
enforcing this opinion. T h e gags are just as
corny as ever and the gadgets standard, but a
gondola turning into a motor boat and then a
hovercraft is too m u c h ! T h e orbital scenes
involving the space shuttle are fascinating,
but expect no more than from the other 007
stories translated (and usually transmuted)
onto celluloid.
The inevitable battle, this time in a space station
Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) in MOONRAKER
John Voight and Faye Dunaway in'T/ie Champ"
â€¢Finally, as this is the last Felix before it's
release date, I would like to mention a film
you will be hearing a lot more about soon.
A L I E N ( X , Ridley Scott) is an extremely
enjoyable sci-fi story with a difference. In an
attempt to draw as large an audience as
possible, Scott has cleverly produced a
mixture of genres. T h e haunted house image
is combined with space hardware as the crew
of the tug " N o s t r o m o " pursue an incredible
alien being in their huge spacecraft. T h e
outstanding feature of this movie in
particular is the superb artwork i n v o k e d :
artists include H . R . G i g c r , designer of the
alien itself, R o n C o b b , Chris Foss and Jean
" M o e b i u s " G i r a u d (Heavy M e t a l ) . W i t h
such talent involved I expected a great deal
and was not disappointed.
T h e plot is basically high tension from
beggining to end, which may be a fault, but I
enjoyed it enormously. Despite a lew
scientific inaccuracies (which I did'nt notice
at the time) the interiors are better than 2001,
no mean feat, and with some superb filming
an air of menace is constantly achieved. G o
and see it without any knowledge of the plot
and you will be surprised and shocked; get
the info from your best pal and spoil the story
and you're a fool!
