NEIL YOUNG - RUST NEVER SLEEPS (Reprise)
"My, My, Hey, Hey I Rock n'
Roll Is here to stay, It's better to
burn out I Than to fade away.
That's as maybe but o n this
showing Neil Young doesn't
intend to do either. After many
years of flirting with excellence,
he h a s c o m e u p w i t h a
masterpiece, his finest work ever.
'Rust Never Sleeps', not to be
confused with the imminent
movie soundtrack to 'Human
Highway' which apparently goes
under the same name, doesn't
have a weak link. Previously
deficiencies always crept in; even
the legendary 'Zuma' album had
some deadweight. But now
recovering from 'Comes A Time',
the most recent album, which
found him deep in a rut. Young
assembles the finest songs he's
written in recent times into a
classis set. O n e side is acoustic
Young - mostly solo, but with
some assistance o n 'Sail Away' -
and one side of electric Young,
with crazy horse, his backing
band for the last ten years.
Throughout there is a 'live' feel
with both the opener 'My, My,
Hey, Hey (Out Of The Blue)' and
the closing 'Hey, Hey, My, M y
(Into The Black) - yes, they're the
ones with the Johnny Rotten
reference - obviously concert
material.
The acoustic 'My, My ' sets
the tone of side one with it's
thoughtful melancholic lyrics and
Young's alluring guitar work
leading the way. It's a bitter song:
"It's out of the blue and into the
black / They give you this, but you
pay for that / A n d once you're
gone you can never come back /
When you're out of the blue and
into the black." A wonderful tale of
the rock n' roll lifestyle which after
radical changes reappears to
close side two.
'Thrasher', a song of the old
ways being swallowed up by the
new, builds slowly, Young's voice
full of emotion and supressed
anger. "When the aimless blade of
science slashed the pearly gates /
It was then I knew I'd had enough,
burned my credit card for fuel / ..
With one-way ticket to the land of
truth and my suitcase in my hand /
How I lost my friends I still don't
understand."
'Pocahontas', the first track on
side two, is about the attrocities
suffered by the Red Indians in the
frontier days. "They killed us in
our tepee / A n d they cut our
women dow.n / They might have
left some babies / Crying on the
g r o u n d . " It's s a d b u t not
sentimental, tender but not
embarassing.
T h e electric, electrifying,
uptempo side 2 features 4 of the
most riveting rock tracks I've
heard. 'Powderfinger' has Young
playing a youthful backwoods
boy facing a gang of cut-throat
rapists sailing up the river to
pillage the isolated settlers. He is
alone and "just turned twenty-
two." A man does what a man has
to do and dies in the process. It's
so real it makes the Eagles look
l i k e c o m p l e t e a m a t e u r s .
The music on this side is the
driving force, the lyrics are cream
on the cake. The rock rhythms go
this way and that, howling chords
and staccato guitar work that
defies belief. 'Welfare Mothers' My
current favourite, "make better
lovers", sings Young, adding a
solo that is truly beautiful. But no
let up and straight into 'Sedan
Delivery', the riffs of which power
towards a stunning climax and
into 'Hey, Hey, My, My (Into the
black), almost unrecognisable as
the opening tune. It's Young
establishing himself as the Kingof
Rock n' Roll. "It's better to burn
out cause rust never sleeps / The
king is gone but he's not
forgotten."
This album is perceptive,
melancholic, realistic, dynamic
and should be at the top of any
shopping list. Buy it and benefit.

A film review of
It was so far fetched that even
an A c t i n g F E L I X E d i t o r ' s
imagination could not rival its
incredible imagery.
Phantasm was fun to watch
but not brilliant. Its trial release
in East Anglia points to good
box office receipts when it is
shown at the Eros, Piccadilly
(starting on September 13th).
A l b u m Review
"The London Concert"
by Dave J a g o
One of the reasons that Oscar
Peterson's playing has never
particularly appealed to me is that
he seems to play with a complete
lack of emotion. T h e impression
has been fueled by watching him
playing happily away to an
enthusiastic audience in the
safety a n d comfort of his own
television chat show. It is a well
k n o w n f a c t , a m o n g s t w e
traditionalists at least, that the
best jazz can only be played by
pennyless, homeless, unloved
('My baby done left me ...') down
and outs, preferably on the verge
of catching pneumonia or going
insane. O n this double album,
however, recorded live at the
Royal Festival Hall last year,
Peterson quite excells himself,
playing with a surprising fire and
passion
Having said that, perhaps I had
better make it clear that this is not
just a record of Oscar Peterson
accompanied by bass and drums,
but of a trio in the proper sense of
the word. A l l three instruments
take an equally important part in
the proceedings. Louis Bellson,
on drums, is known to many
through his work with big bands,
although he is in fact no stranger
to small group playing. His
d r u m m i n g is a l w a y s w e l l
considered, and his short solo
spots manage to be totally
stunning, whilst remaining fully
integrated within the musical
context. The drum choruses in
'Sweet Georgia Brown' have to be
heard to be believed - no boring
extended ego trips here!
John Heard, on bass, produces
a much grittier, and to my mind
better, tone than does Nick
Peterson, who is Petersons
regular bass player. Heard's
bouncy, angular style matches
the fluancy of the piano lines
beautifully. Peterson himself, of
course, plays with sheer technical
genius. The rendition of 'Sweet
Georgia Brown,' one of the stand-
out tracks on the album, is
nothing short of incredible, and
the ease with which he changes
from style to style, bouncing from
stride into bebop in the space of a
few s e c o n d s , is s o m e t i m e s
breathtaking.
As to choice of material, we are
presented with a wide selection.
The album combines standards
such as 'Ain't Misbehavin' ' and
'Satin Doll' with songs heard less
often in a jazz setting. 'Falling in
Love with Love' is an example of
an often overlooked number
which suits the jazz idiom
beautifully. With the addition of
Fats Waller's 'Jitterbug Waltz' and
a real live 12 bar, Oscar's own
'Hogtown blues', there is fun for
all the family. A couple of bal lands
are included, 'I get Along Without
You Very Well' and 'Emily'. I found
them far too protracted and
rambling, but there are people
who like such things. The other
track I disliked was the Duke of
Ellington Medley, which just
sounds disjointed, and really
serves no purpose. The track that I
would single out as being quite
excellent are 'Sweet Georgia
B r o w n , ' ' J i t t e r b u g W a l t z ' ,
'Hogtown Blues', and 'Pennies
From Heaven', despite the totally
unnecessary, rambling solo piano
intro of the sort that Peterson
seems to favour.
The quality of the sound is
rather good for a live album, as
one would expect from the R F H
Audience noise is kept to a
minimum, and the bass in
particular is mixed very clearly. A
slight hiss is clearly audible on the
quiet section - hopefully this will
not be carried over onto the
production copies.
This record should please both
established Peterson fans and the
general listening public alike, and
may well win over a few like me
A Â«who, till now, have been a bit wary
of this man's prodigal talent on the
grounds that he uses it with too
little expression.
