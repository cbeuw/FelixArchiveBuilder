published in FELIX. Fox Brain Shuttleworth
"We act for Mr Shuttleworth who has referred a copy of the Union Bluebook
to us together with copies of correspondence relevant to his improper removal
as Editor of the Union newspaper.
Paragraph 19 of the Rule Book states quite clearly that any amendments to
the rules can only be incorporated into the Book in accordance with rule 19
and the Editor of t h e newspaper can only be removed from office in
accordance with rule 4b.
Mr Shuttleworth has therefore been properly appointed Editor and cannot
be dismissed in the way in which you have purported to do.
We are therefore writing to you to require you by next Monday 20th August
to confirm to us in writing that Mr Shuttleworth will be allowed to continue as
Editor and that his grant be reinstated.
If you are unable to accede to our request then our client will have no
alternative but to institute proceedings against you and the Deputy President
as officers of the Union for the appropriate court order."
