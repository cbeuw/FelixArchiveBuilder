For a change I have selected
one of /ESOP's fables to
complete this back page. It is
taken from a book published in
1887 and was produced by the
Caldecotts and the drawing is
by J D Cooper.
EDITORIAL
The last Editor of FELIX,
John Harris, came up from
Windsor to see how I was
getting on. When he read the
front page of this issue he said,
"John Shuttleworth has gone
over the top this time." I have
little more to add to that
comment.
It was unfortunate that Mr
Shuttleworth failed his exams. I
would have enjoyed working
with him if he had become
Editor. Mr Shuttleworth has
sought help from Sheyne
L u c o c k . S h e y n e lost the
election for ICU President and
also, like Mr Shuttleworth, had
a c a d e m i c p r o b l e m s . Now
Sheyne and his Liberal friends
have helped Mr Shuttleworth
start legal proceedings.

don't object to a bridle and to my mounting you with javelins in
my hand." T h e Horse agreed, and was mounted by the M a n ;
but, instead of being revenged on the Stag, he himself became
a servant to the M a n .
