Romeo and Juliet
at the Old Vic
This is a new production of
Romeo and Juliet performed by
the newly formed O l d V i c
Company. All new ventures have
teething problems and this is no
e x c e p t i o n . T h e p e r f o r m a n c e
lacked a certain degree of
professionalism to lift it above a
play you watch and forget. To
start with, we were sitting at the
front and so were disturbed by
seeing the cast and stagehands
behind the scenery and by noise
of shifting props.
The beginning was bad - there
is no other word for it! We sat
munching our fruit pastels as the
curtain rose but were rather
confused when the house lights
remained on. Tw o actors began to
stroll around at the back of the set
and seemed as bemused as we
were and to add to this muddled
scene, the voice of the stage
manager could clearly be heard.
The set, too, was a little
surprising; it consisted of a
moveable gantry and a pair of
curtains which were positioned
noisily for each scene and
reminded us more of the setting
for Jailhouse Rock than the city
centre of Verona.
The play began with a fight and
this was indicative of the scenes to
follow; noisy and fast. Indeed,
speed seemed to be one of the
only constant characteristics of
the play! However, there were
s o m e r e d e e m i n g features,in
p a r t i c u l a r Ian R i c h a r d s o n ' s
portrayal of Mercutio. He piayed
the part with the maturity of a
seasoned Shakespearean actor,
bringing just the right amount of
humour to this tragedy. His death
was rather overacted but still
fitted in with his character and the
play as a whole. Robert Putt, as
Peter, and Barbara Jefford, as
Juliet's nurse, also acted their
parts well and merit a special
mention.
One would have expected the
lovers, Michael Thomas and Janet
Maw, to have been "starry-eyed"
but these two young players
seemed unable to give the
performance required of them in
such a part and this, above all,
detracted from the play. Janet
Maw looked the part and gave all
she had in it but somehow she
lacked the necessary passion and
M i c h a e l T h o m a s t h e s a m e
problem.
Scene rushed after scene
(were they trying to finish before
last orders or were they worried
about the tube strike?) until the
lights went down after the great
C a p u l e t / M o n t a g u e r e -
conciliation leaving the c u p of
poison oscillating back and forth
on the stage.
I think the faults were in the
production rather than the acting
and the poor beginning (including
not being allowed to enter the
auditorium until 20 past 7) put the
audience off.
However, the performance
should mature over the next few
nights and it is a good evening's
entertainment.

Tales of the Unexpected - Frank
Marino & Mahogany Rush (CBS)
If you imagine Deep Purple
with Candian accents and without
the mastery of J o n Lord on
keyboards, then y o u have quite a
close approximation to M a h -
ogny Rush. The music on this
album relies very heavily on
r e p t i t i o n o f b a s s c h o r d
sequences;, with very slight
v a r i a t i o n s i n t r o d u c e d at
a p p r o x i m a t e l y h a l f m i n u t e
intervals.
'Tales of the Uneaxpected' is
half live and half recorded in the
studio, and although the bands
reputition has been built on its live
performances around C a n a d a
and the U.S., the studio side of
t he album is far stronger than the
Live side. But it is easy to imagine
that the music would sound better
played about ten times louder
than it need be in a sweaty and
smokey concert hall.
The musicianship on this L.P.
is very good in parts - mostly the
parts played by Frank Marino
himself, w h o plays lead guitar
almost like it was part of his body,
and his synthesizer playing is
competent. However if the other
two members of the band, Paul
Harwood on bass and James
Ayoubi, drummer, have half the
talent of Marino they don't like to
show it, as their part in the music
is just keeping a steady but basic
back-beat for the lead guitar to
outshine. But then this might be
the fault of M r Marino in the
writing, since he has written six
out of the eight tracks on the
album.
Sadly, the two tracks most
worthy of further scrutiny are the
two cover versions o n the studio
side. T h e first being Dylan's 'All
A l o n g t h e W a t c h t o w e r ' . Y o u
r e m e m b e r J i m i H e n d r i x ' s
version? Well this in the same vein
but, predictably, not so good; and
if covering one of Hendrix
greatest is inviting criticism the
next song on the record is
'Norwegian Wood' by Lennon and
McCartney, this is performed in a
very different way to the original
and possibly better than the
B e a t l e s v e r s i o n , w i t h t h e
exception of the vocals. Definitly
Maghogony Rush's version is
more interresting and has more
content than that of the Beatles.
The best original song in this
set is the title track, which
contains more variation than any
of the others, with some very nifty
guitar work a fast beat but enough
change in lead instrument and
tempo to keep the interest of the
listener, parhaps the only track on
the album capable of doing so.
Mahogany Rush have not
made much of an impression on
British heavy rockers and I'm sure
that this is not the record to break
them over here. I should give this a
miss.
The Undertones
- The Undertones (Sire)
I return from the sweaty mass
of enthusiastic Marquee pogoers
with my ears still ringing. The
Undertones 'live' definately have
to been seen and heard to be
believed. Of course good live
performers do not always fare well
on disc but two weeks later when I
listen to this new album it sounds
just as fresh and innovative. The
Undertones have evolved from
punk and, with admirable ease,
now play the best modern pop of
this age. If you think I'm
exagerating check out this album.
Sure they have a few rough edges,
something not quite right here or
there, but they're learning fast.
Despite their naive appearance
they've got it pretty well sussed
out.
Hailing from Derry, Northern
Ireland, the 'tones sing vividly of
the insecurity, loneliness and
yearning of adolescence. They
make their point with breath-
taking economy; straight to the
heart of the matter and after
i m p a r t i n g t h e i r u n d o u b t e d
wisdom the song ends. It's as
simple as that; fourteen tracks in
just half an hour and everyone a
potential hit single. But it doesn't
sound thrown together, it flows
from one juicy observation to the
next. Youth is on their side - ages
ranging between 18 and 21 - and if
this is what the debut album turns
up I can hardly wait for more.
Each song - I could mention
them all - stands out except 'True
Confessions' which received a
r a u n c h i e r treatment o n the
' T e e n a g e K i c k s ' E P . t h e
s t a g g e r i n g r h y t h m g u i t a r
augmented by more detailed work
from the lead guitarist serve as a
foil to Fergal Sharkey's careering
vocals. The songs are short,
powerful, danceable and don't
even have a chance to get boring. I
could go on ad infinitum and still
not convince you but my message
is this:- it's a good album, get it
and enjoy yourself (or others)
with some of the best music
around today.
