Union Position on
UCU Strikes
Felix has oﬀered
coverage on strike
action previously, and
across this issue. See
Comment and News
across last two issues.
The Union Council
first received a paper
that called for the Union
to support and endorse
the UCU strikes cur-
rently taking place at the
College. The paper noted
the impact that poor staff
treatment can have on the
student body by demoti-
vating staff and damaging
recruitment, and criticised
the College’s approach to
handling local pay negoti-
ations.
The paper was accom-
panied by an impassioned
speech by Michael
McGarvey, the head of the
UCU, who attended this
section of the meeting.
The paper suggested
that the Union support the
strike action, to support
the UCU in meetings
with the College, and to
disseminate supporting
publicity materials. It also
mandates representatives
to ensure impact on stu-
dents is minimised, as well
as mandating the Union
President to write to the
Provost to encourage the
pay dispute be negotiated
fairly.
Concerns were raised
by some Union Council
members about the Union
actively supporting a
strike that has a large neg-
ative impact on students,
citing conversations
within their respective
remits or student bodies.
The paper passed with
a vote of 29 for, 1 against,
and 1 abstention.
Standing Orders
Amendment
Felix previously
reported on a Council
dispute over voting
membership of
the Education and
Representation Board
(ERB). Changes to
the Standing Orders
removed voting rights
from departmental
reps in order to ensure
quorum was reached.
The Standing Orders
were indeed updated to
remove voting rights, after
disputing ERB represent-
atives failed to come up
with a viable alternative.
These representatives
felt satisfied with having
had the opportunity to
try to resolve the issue
and discuss it internally
to ERB. It was also noted
that departmental reps can
still contribute to indica-
tive votes, which the ERB
could hold as often as it
felt necessary.
Further debate was held
about the way in which
Constituent Unions’
constitutions are changed;
currently, these have to
be approved every year,
as they contain regular
changes for small things
such as changing the
name of a position. To
remove bureaucracy from
the process, it was sug-
gested that these smaller
topics be dealt with via
the Regulations for their
constitutions.
However, lack of over-
sight from Council made
some members unhappy
with the proposed change;
changing the duties of a
Treasurer, for example,
has a consequence beyond
just the Constituent Union
itself due to CUs acting
as management groups
for clubs and societies
as well. Various options
were debated, such as
handing oversight off to
the Governance and Iden-
tity Board, each with their
own issues.
The debate was likely
sparked by the RCSU’s
recent decision to uni-
laterally change their
committee without con-
sultation with the Council.
The resolution did not
pass, with a vote of 14 for,
8 against, and 9 abstain-
ing.
Publicity Policy
A review of the Union’s
publicity policy was sug-
gested, looking to assess
whether its still suitable
for the modern operation
of the Union. Require-
ments of the policy, such
as requiring that all events
go onto the ‘What’s On’
calendar, were suggested
for revision, as was the
specific exemption of
Silwood campus from the
policy. Contradictory re-
quirements, such as a ban
on having any ICU logos
on election materials
while also requiring that
all election materials have
the ICU banner on them,
were targeted as well.

Discussion of Breadth
of Council Submis-
sions
It was noted that the
number of papers submit-
ted to Council – and the
diversity of students who
were submitting – had
decreased drastically this
year compared to previ-
ous. The Council Chair,
3
Lloyd James, sought to
open up discussion about
why Council members
were not submitting
papers.
For reference, the at-
tached table is reproduced
from the Council paper,
representing what papers
were submitted and by
whom in each Ordinary
Meeting (OM) of the year,
comparing this year with
each year back to 2016/17.
In general, Council
members responses were
that they would typically
take issues to the subcom-
mittees for consideration
– meaning that perhaps
the new Council structure
has contributed. They ad-
ditionally said that papers
used in the past simply
to mandate sabbatical
officers to take certain
actions felt like an inef-
fective method, saying
they would rather just talk
to the sabs informally.
