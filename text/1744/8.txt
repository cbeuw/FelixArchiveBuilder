“Editorials

penned in
the late 90s
were in vogue
decades later”
here translate beyond.
The recent case of prom-
inent Time magazine
reporter Aatish Taseer
being stripped of his
Overseas citizenship of
India for writing critical
articles about Indian
Prime Minister Narendra
Modi, suggests that this
problem is not limited to
Western liberals. Rather
this is an issue that anyone
wanting to express an
opinion must face.. Will
my current opinions
affect my job prospects in
a particular sector or am I
narrowing my chances by
taking a stance on an issue
currently and opening
myself up to reprisals in
the future? With such a
broad variety of concerns
to check off every time a
student speaks out, one
is forced to question just
how much discourse we
unintentionally suppress
as a society? To shackle
young minds with the
entrenchment of thought
and indoctrination, and in
principle no different than
censorship in a commu-
nist regime or classroom
teachings of creationism
in America.
With an informed,
engaged and societally
invested readership,
discourse can be and
are drivers of change in
society. But as much as the
written word is powerful,
we need to recognise and
appreciate that fluidity
of thought and ideology
exists while at university.
To be clear, the purpose
of this piece is neither to
suggest absolving student
writers of responsibility
for their views, nor is to
to suggest that all or any
student(s) engaging with
the paper are ill-informed
or are likely to change
their views in the future.
To take the case for the
former would mean
delegitimizing student
opinions and undermining
the value of student pub-
lications while the latter
would be an insult to the
intelligence of the student
community. However
there is a case to be made
for moderation between
these two extremes,
one involving a shift in
societal outlook, on how
we perceive and digest
information from student
publications. Fundamen-
tal here is understanding
that these opinions could
echo developing senti-
ments, ones that deserve
serious and legitimate
engagement nonetheless.
One path to achieving
this is through enacting
explicit legal buffers safe-
guarding student writers
from reprisals and calls of
accountability, similar to
juvenile accountability for
criminal behavior. Such a
mechanism would in no
way delegitimize their
voice, while offering a
relatively safe space to ex-
periment intellectually. In
a society which has a legal
age mandated on every
social activity in life, from
sex and drinking to voting
in elections, it seems only
fair that intellectual explo-
ration also be harboured
in a similar way. While
recognizing that often the
accountability that I am
addressing here happens
definitions and arbi-
trariness of the modern
world is a sure recipe for
in the public sphere rather
than in courts of law, such
an explicit legal precedent
would be one welcome
step in shaping societal
outlook and would make
the dilemma about intel-
lectual accountability and
responsibility part of the
mainstream narrative. The
answer however is incom-
plete and with this piece
I hope to bring voice to a
concern that I believe is
sure to exist among many
in the university, and with
engagement, bring clarity
to the apparent dichotomy
with how currently a uni-
versity press operates in
society - where we expect
one to learn and espouse
at the same time.
Strikes
COMMENT
Calum Drysdale
Comment Editor
T
he University and
College Union,
the workers
union that rep-
resents Imperial College
researchers and academ-
ics, has announced strikes
that will take place over
fourteen days in the next
month, starting yesterday.
These strikes were called
after a break down in
negotiations between rep-
resentatives of the union
and the College over the
pension scheme that the
College pays the pension
contributions of its staff
into. The pension scheme
is increasing the required
contributions required
from staff which amounts
to a pay cut for staff as
this will not lead to an in-
crease in the pension that
they receive. In addition,
there is a local pay dispute
at Imperial, where staff
salary increases are below
the rate of inflation -
meaning a real-world pay
cut again. See Felix 1742
News.
What is the purpose
of striking?
Strikes first occurred in
Britain during the Indus-
trial Revolution. Workers
that were mistreated by
factory owners would all
refuse to work unless con-
ditions were improved.
In a modern context, the
purpose of a strike is to,
by collectively withdraw-
ing the labour of workers,
force an employer to give
ground in negotiations.
The strikes adversely
affect me
As students some of us
are going to be adversely
affected by the strikes.
Our daily routines might
be disrupted as lectures
are cancelled and we
might worry about content
going untaught. However,
this is not the fault of the
staff. Many staff will not
or to discriminate against
anyone that crosses a
picket line to continue
working, the act of
crossing a picket line still
holds enormous social
stigma for many. This is
because crossing a picket
line is associated with a
lack of support for the
strikers.
This lack of support is
traditionally taken very
poorly by strikers and sup-
porters of strikes though
this depends on who it
is crossing. If colleagues
of the strikers cross the
picket line strikers are
angry because while they
are losing out on earnings
in order to help improve
the working conditions of
the entire workforce, their
colleagues will gain all
the benefits without any of
the sacrifice. If customers
(or in this case students)
cross the picket line, this
can be regarded as a lack
of empathy. If the student
were, in later life, to be in
a difficult situation, why
should anyone support or
help them given that they
didn’t support or help
those in trouble striking?
The essence of the
argument is that resisting
large and powerful or-
ganisations or employers
such as Imperial or the
USS pension fund is
strike, despite conditions,
because they will not
be willing to put at risk
the education of their
students. This brings
into focus the intensity
of feeling amongst aca-
demics, that are making
their anger known. Strikes
are the last resort of a
workforce that sees no
other way forward. The
fault lies with the pension
scheme for refusing to
yield, and on the College
for refusing to negotiate
in goodwill on local pay
disputes. Strikes could
have been prevented had a
more equitable agreement
been reached but the
College would prefer to
see staff and students lose
out and hope that the tide
of public opinion turns
against the strikes, forcing
them to return to work
rather than give way.
What is a picket line?
A picket line used to
be the line of workers that
would gather outside a
factory to prevent supplies
or a new workforce being
able to enter. Over time
the picket line has become
a more symbolic, though
still visible, part of strikes.
While it is now illegal to
prevent people or goods
from entering buildings,
only possible if everyone
participates. If a work-
force is disorganised
and atomised they can
all be, individually, mis-
treated. A single absent
worker can be quickly
replaced. However, when
organised, the strength of
numbers gives workers,
who traditionally have
little power, might.
Why should I support
the strikers?
As students at a uni-
versity where many of
us will go on to go into
further education or even
research, the situation of
lecturers and researchers
is directly relevant to us.
Their situation very well
might be our situation.
The pension strikes in par-
ticular will predominantly
affect mid- or early-career
academics, as they will
pay higher contributions
for longer. Furthermore
there is a moral question
with regards to the pay
dispute: why should
Imperial, the university
that benefits enormously
from the research output
of these individuals, treat
them so poorly? The
journal Nature ranked
Imperial third in Britain
for quality of research.
This is research that is
being done by academics.
Surely they deserve a
measure of the wealth that
they helped to create?
Do striking staff get
paid?
No. Staff that go on
strike do not get paid for
the work that is not done.
This is in many cases an
extreme action for people
that already claim that
they are not being paid
well.
Will my fees be
refunded?
Two years ago when
the last round of strikes
occurred, students were
not refunded any fees.
Instead money that
would have been spent
on lecturers’ wages was
given to the departments
on the basis of how badly
each department had been
affected by strikes. By
contrast, this year money
will be kept in a central pot
and departments will be
able to apply for a portion
of this money. This means
that the worst-affected
departments may not get a
proportional return when
it comes to reinvestment
of the saved cost for the
College.
