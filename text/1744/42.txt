Editor-in-Chief
satisfy a range of strin-
gent criteria in order to
accrue sufficient entry
points. Criteria range
from potential future
earnings, probability to
strike in any future pen-
sion disputes and abil-
ity to scream the word
“LADZZZZ” across the
bar in an Etonian accent
while chugging a pint
through a tie. Few, if
any members of the stu-
dent body are expected
to gain points from the
latter criterion, although
a few members of rugby
club have been recently
hospitalised.
When questioned
about this controversial
policy, lifelong Priti
Patel fan and Masonic
Lodge member Servin
Shabeghi told Negafelix
that, “stringent member-
ship requirements are
what ensures the quality
of shapes pulled on the
dance floor. We don’t
want a repeat of the
Body Popping Incident.
Some of the janitors are
still traumatised and we
just can’t afford payouts
at this time. Don’t get me
started on belly dancing.
Not to be culturally
insensitive, but I prefer
it when the small intes-
tine remains an internal
organ.” The Union is
said to be pushing to a
more intelligent dance
style in Metric this year.
Naturally RSM students
are livid at being so
deliberately targeted,
after their characteristic
finger jab and shuffle
was named explicitly in
the new policy.
When Negafelix
spoke to students about
the recent change,

enthusiast couldn’t
the better, and I love it
when they have dimples.
Phrenology can tell you
so much about a person.
I’ve been able to avoid
wasting time on so many
people I’m not compat-
ible with by fondling
their head bones before
introducing myself.”
Negafelix also under-
stands that some charac-
teristics will result in an
automatic ban. People
that buy tickets before on
the Union website will
naturally be excluded as
pre-planning precludes
people from having
an absolute “mental
one.” Planning’s for
nerds and will get you
an instant ban. While
bans are normally per-
manent, special desired
characteristics, such as

being on the University
Challenge Team grant
you an exemption and
access to the fast stream
queue even if you would
not usually meet the cri-
teria. Let’s face it, none
of them would usually
meet any desirable cri-
teria, but let’s get their
big sexy brains on the
dance floor. Maybe Feb
can measure their heads.
Opponents of the
scheme have called it
draconian and over the
top. The Union’s only
response was to roar
and blow fire at the
complaining whingers
from atop their mound
of coins and treasure
while simultaneously
performing an impromp-
tu Kinky Boots inspired
high-kicking routine.
F
ollowing stag-

for entry, this
week Metric
has brought in a points-
based system to control
who gets to experience
disappointment and who
gets to go home. Under
the proposed rules,
students must be able to
