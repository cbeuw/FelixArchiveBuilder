A Closer Look: Trade Tariffs
in the form of fixed,
tangible assets such as
gold. This mercantile
thinking resulted in
countries, particularly in
Western Europe, trying
to become wealthier by
maximising exports and
minimising imports, in
part through steep tariffs
on foreign-produced
goods. For instance, the
1764 Sugar Act raised
duties on imported sugar
and molasses, to give
British sugar growers
in the West Indies a
monopoly. It was not
until the 18th century that
economists such as Adam
Smith and David Ricardo
began to question this
arrangement, leading to
the theory of comparative
advantage. This argues
that countries each excel
at producing different
types of products due to
their natural differences,
and so it is of maximum
benefit to all involved if
each country focusses on
the activities in which
it excels, and trades
freely with one another
rather than creating trade
barriers such as tariffs
which subsidise uncom-
petitive industries. This
view steadily grew in pop-
ularity in Europe over the
course of the 19th
century
and until the First World
War, for instance with the
1846 repeal of the Corn
Laws in the UK removing
steep import duties on
cheap foreign grain.
After the Second World
War, free trade once again
ﬂourished, beginning with
the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) in 1947, and
culminating in, at the end
of the 20th
century, of the
creation of the European
Single Market in 1993,
North Atlantic Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) in
1994 and, crucially, the in-
ception of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO)

in 1995. The latter was
formed as an international
forum for settling disputes
and laying down rules,
today underpinning 96%
of global trade between
164 member countries.
Without this regulatory
body controlling tariffs
and acting as an honest
broker in global trade,
the globalisation of the
last two decades - with
multinational companies
building supply chains
spanning multiple con-
tinents - would not have
been possible.
Tariffs as a weapon
Yet recently these
organisations have come
under threat, as protec-
tionist policies have again
come into vogue. In the
tweet from July 2018
below , President Donald
Trump referred to tariffs
as ‘the greatest!’, slapping
on tariffs for geopolitical
leverage and to protect
American manufacturing
industries. Before the
trade war began, the
average American tariff
on Chinese imports
stood at 3% and the
average Chinese tariff on
American imports was
8%. Currently, the average
tariff level on both sides is
around 20%, even after the

T
he primary
reason for a tariff
is that it enables
the exploitation
of the domestic consumer
by a process indistinguish-
able from sheer robbery. ~

A tariff is a tax imposed

month. The jewel in the
free-trade economists’
crown, the World Trade
Organisation, is under
threat, with America
blocking the appointment
of new judges to its ap-
pellate body in December
meaning that this final
arbiter can currently no
longer function. Though
117 countries signed a
letter asking the US to
break the impasse and the
EU is trying to broker an
alliance to bypass this US
block, the lack of multilat-
eral support for the WTO
will likely mean that in
the medium to long term,
trade will become a lot
more contentious and less
directly on the domestic
consumer, making the
imported product less
attractive. This can either
take the form of a fixed
tax on a certain class of
imported item, or as a
percentage of the value
of the imported item.
The aims of a tariff are
usually protectionist – to
shield a domestic industry
from foreign competition,
though they can also be
levied to exert political
leverage over another
country. The wisdom of
imposing such levies con-
