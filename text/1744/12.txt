A Total War: with the French, the Bees and Gravity
Caryl Churchill’s “Far Away” feels like live theatre’s answer to Black Mirror
T
he only thing
worse than war
is total war.
Caryl Churchill’s
play Far Away violently
explores this concept
without showing any
violence at all. Through
casual conversation
which turns into tense di-
alogue, the psychological
aspects of a war which
has consumed an entire
society are explored.
Conceived back in 2000
by Caryl Churchill, this
performance seems even
more pertinent today. Its
dark themes are tastefully
intertwined with lighter
dialogue that gives you
a real punch in the gut.
Though only 40 minutes
long, it feels just as in-
tense as an entire season
of Black Mirror.
The first scene shows
a young girl Joan (Sophia
Ally) slowly piecing
together a rather har-
rowing scene that she
accidentally witnessed.
Her aunt Harper (Jessica
Hynes) lies to her at first,
but when Joan slowly
reveals that she knows
more and more, Harper
can no longer cover up the
truth. This tense exchange
alludes to governments
revealing inconvenient
truths to their citizens on
a strictly need to know
basis. The less they know
the better, and the more
they know the more they
will want to know. Funnily
enough, the audience
throughout this play is
kept in the dark about
many things and truths are
only revealed and pieced
together over the course
of the production, making
it in some ways an immer-
sive performance.
The next scene sees
Joan all grown up
(Aisling Loftus) making
artistic hats for a parade
alongside hat connoisseur
Todd (Simon Manyonda).
They cheerily get to know
each other over the course
of the week with some
allusions to problems
with their employer. Their
aloof conversations seem
like those of guards sitting
in a break room... during a
genocide, as the hats they
create are to be paraded
by prisoners about to be
burnt alive.
This scene is split up
with their hats growing
in size as well as flam-
boyance during every
section. The way this is
done and in general how
sets are changed on stage
is genius. Every so often
the lights will go off in
the theatre, fully off, like
you’ve just closed your
eyes. When they come
back on seconds later, like
waking up from a dream,
everything has changed
and you feel a bit diso-
riented as you are thrust
back into the action.
The final scene, by
which point the audience
may just have gotten
their bearings, throws
everything into more con-
fusion. The idea of war
engulfing everything and
everyone is taken quite
literally. The characters
discuss what side different
countries are on in the
war, France, Venezuela,
Russia. But then start
talking about alliances
with other demographics:
dentists, doctors, dogs.
More abstract quantities
like weather and gravity
have taken sides in this
fight. Although funny at
first, the visually alarmed
characters live this in their
everyday life. How can
they walk in a forest when
they don’t know what side
the oak trees are on? How
can they leave the house
without being attacked
by the ghastly “children
under 5” militias? In total
war, all is fair game but
terrible consequences
ensue when we see this
really being put into
practice.
Yes this all sounds
weird, but it will have you
on the edge of your seat
for all 40 minutes. You’ll
leave dazed, confused, yet
at the same time satisfied.
If you are looking for
something to make you
think, laugh a little and
have a minor internal
break down, this is the
play for you!
Loftus and Manyonda have good chemistry during their fun hat making scene until a darker meaning is re-
vealed // Johan Persson
