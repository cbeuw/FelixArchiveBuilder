A fashion fad or an avant-garde attitude?
A discussion as to how our average Imperial student utilises the effects of ‘Power dressing’ and if that even really
means anything

I
n the abundance of
lab-restricted attire
and ‘my coursework
is due in the morning’
clobber, the significance
of style often be swept
into STEM insouciance,
with comfort and utility
taken to the extreme of
laziness and slobbishness.
Despite the fact that
Imperial College London
isn’t everyone’s runway,
our cohort is multidimen-
sional and their garments
mean more than what
meets the eye.
We question who or what
holds power in fashion? Is
the psychology of ‘Power
Fashion’ a gospel truth or
pseudoscience bullshit?
And when does confident
clothing become comic
book costume?
I spoke to my peers about
their relationship with
their wardrobe.

Day to day style? Black
jeans and black fitted top
Is there anything you are
limited by? I don’t like
wearing leggings unless
it’s for working out or for

wearing at home
Who or what are you
influenced by? My mum
as most of my clothes are
hers
Do you dress to impress?
I do try, but sometimes I
just cannot be bothered at
uni. But I always dress to
impress when I go to party
or a meeting
How does how you dress
make you feel? Like I
don’t have to think or
worry about how I look
because I know I look
great
What is your power
outfit? Why? When I’m
at a party it would have
to be a classic little black
dress but with plenty of
glitter as it puts me in a
good mood; for any work
then it would be my pink
suit jacket and black skirt
because there is lack of
pink in business attire and
I’m glad I’ve managed to
find a something formal in
my favourite colour
Heather‘If the hood-
ie fits, buy it in every
colour’Kwun
Day to day style? Jeans
and a jumper or hoodie
usually
Is there anything you are
limited by? The weather
and if I’m stuck in the lab
all day or not
Who or what are you
influenced by? Probably
if I see someone around
or on Instagram and I like
their style, I would take
fashion inspiration from
there
Do you dress to impress?
Not day-to-day at uni, but
on the right occasion then
sure
How does how you dress
make you feel? Wearing
something that I’m com-
fortable in or feel good in
makes me feel confident
What is your power outfit?
Why? If I wear heels with
an outfit, I instantly feel
like a boss
Andres ‘In constant
denial that the UK
climate isn’t tropical’
Martin
Day to day style? Re-
gardless of whether it’s a
snow storm or a heatwave
it’s shorts and tie-dye or
tropical t-shirts everyday
Is there anything you are
limited by? Only limited
by labs when I’m forced
to wear trousers instead...
got to cover those ankles
Who or what are you
influenced by? Anything
that looks summery or
beachy
Do you dress to impress?
Sometimes, but mostly
it’s whatever is comfy
How does how you dress
make you feel? Bomb
What is your power outfit?
Why? My power outfit is
a suit for a black-tie event
for example, because
it makes me feel like a
badass adult who can be
comfortable and sexy at
the same time
Conor ‘Couldn’t care
less Crooks
Day to day style? Usually
just a t-shirt and a hoodie
with black chinos, along-
side fun socks
Is there anything you are
limited by? Sometimes I
get a bit daring and I think
about switching up the
hoodie, but I don’t really
care most of the time so
it’s the same one on repeat
for a couple days
Who or what are you in-
fluenced by? By whatever
isn’t in the wash
Do you dress to impress?
Sometimes if I want to
look ‘nice’ I’ll put on a
shirt when I’m going out
with my girlfriend
How does how you dress
make you feel? I feel a bit
better when I put effort in,
but only because it’s the
shirt is a tad more special
What is your power outfit?
Why? Shirt and sweater
because I feel much
cleaner when I don’t have
a hood, but I usually wear
the hood because my ears
get chilly
It’sinterestingtohighlight
that someone’s power
outfit can really vary and
doesn’t have to be velvet
suit and bowtie to feel like
a boss, but simply could
be the lack of a hood.
Despite, whatever re-
search has been done on
how clothing changes
people’s perception of
you, a common theme
seen from power dressing
would be that adopting a
mind-set that fashion can
be utilised as a tool of
influence on yourself, is
the most influential part
of all...even for the most
nonchalant of the group.
