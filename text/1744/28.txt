Jollof Mama: The Home of the Innovative Jollof
A Jollof Burrito? Sounds pretty blasphemous but here
me out. Jollof Mama has managed to set itself apart
from all the other West African themed spots popping
up. Not only do they have this head turning dish but it
also has the added benefit of working so well. Let’s see if
I can turn you into a believer too.

I
mperial is all about
innovation. From
Hackathons to the
Enterprise Labs, the
ability to create out of
what is new and bring new
life to what is old is in the
very essence of not only
this institution but all of
London. So, when I saw
that there was a food stand
that sold jollof burritos, an
amalgamation of a much
loved West African dish
in a Mexican-inspired
package, I just had to see
what they had to offer.
And I have to say that I am
so glad I did. Last term, I
went every week to one of
their locations.
Now you can’t write
about jollof rice without
addressing the parboiled
elephant in the room. All
over West Africa, there
are fights about which
country has concocted the
jollof rice recipe to rule
them all. I’ll leave that for
our other writer to debate
but all I’m going to say is
that Nigeria may not win
many battles, but with this
late addition to our troops,
we may just win the war.
The first obstacle was
getting to this gem. It was
a hard sell to many of my
friends to do the journey
with me. Many are
spoiled by the Farmer’s
Market just outside of
their departments. They
are too used to one of the
Tuesday stall options and
nothing more as their ad-
venturous choice of meal
for the week. Don’t get me
wrong, I love the market
but with the same vendors
present every week, once
you’ve tried them all
there nothing exciting
to it anymore. However,
this stand is only open
for a short period of time
and changes location
throughout the working
week, making finding the
day where we were free
and the stall was close by
a harder problem than the
Seven Bridges of Königs-
berg.
I found that as Imperial
students, our best bets are
Tuesdays and Fridays.
On Tuesdays they are in
White City, a short walk
from the White City
Campus and on the way
to the South Kensington
Campus for those of you
living in North Acton. On
Fridays, they are in Ham-
mersmith’s Lyric Square
a mere stone throw away
from at least one Medicine
student at any given point.
They are open from 11:30
till 14:00 but sometimes
they sell out fast so I
recommend getting there
sooner rather than later to
avoid disappointment.
The infamous jollof
burrito is not just a
gimmick to make your
parent kiss their teeth
at what you get up to at
university. It’s packed to
the brim with jollof rice,
plantain, suya, beans
and salad. The jollof rice
is the next best thing to
your mother’s recipe. It’s
made fresh on site and
well-seasoned. It makes
the burrito a really warm,
filling treat. I find the
beans to be very plain as
they aren’t stewed like
normally done in Nigeria.
I sometimes get mine
without them as they don’t
really add to the flavour
or texture though they do
show a commitment to the
Mexican theme.

either chicken or beef
and you can get a mix of
both. Both work really
well, never tough or
dry in the burrito which
would take away from
experience. Their plantain
is my favourite part of the
meal. You see, plantain is
a lot like banana but a bit
starchier. It’s more akin to
potatoes in the sense that
it is cooked like a vegeta-
ble. For this burrito, they
are cut into cubes and
fried at the stand. They
always manage to use soft
plantains that makes for
a whole new dimension
to the texture and a burst
of sweetness whenever
a piece is included in
the bite. It’s always a
welcomed surprise. The
