A
s much as
fashion sets
trends for the
future, it holds
up a mirror to society
and reflects the concerns,
aspirations and feelings
of the time. Think Dior’s
“we should all be femi-
nists” t-shirt from just a
few seasons ago, and the
huge stir it caused. With
social justice being an
area of intense debate and
activism in recent years,
the large fashion houses
used Chimamanda Ngozi
Adichie’s essay title to
endorse the message,
causing the fashion in-
dustry and wider media
to pay attention to
current women’s rights
movements. The fashion
moments we remember
are always a case of the
right aesthetic with the
right message at the right
time. However, there’s a
new style which is hugely
increasing in popularity
and market influence
which, in my opinion,
is completely devoid of
any meaning or integrity.
What is Athleisure and
its popularity saying, if
it’s saying anything at
all, about contemporary
society?
Athleisure takes the
functionality of items
designed for the gym,
adds a touch of luxury, and
pushes up the price tag by
several orders of magni-
tude. It was described by a
JD Sports Chief Executive
as clothing you can “wear
to the gym and the pub”
(just not that one pub in
Edinburgh which recently
banned “jobby catchers
and mankles”) and it is
unique from sportswear
or streetwear movements
in its focus on minimal
functional designs and
high-quality materials.
And this approach seems
to be working very well.
Athleisure in recent
years has outgrown
other clothing areas and
is expected to swell to
a market value of $100
Billion (USD) this year.
Brands like Equinox, Lu-
lulemon, and WONE have
seen exceptional growth
over the last few seasons
by encouraging their
customers to wear their
cycling shorts whether
they’re cycling to the gym
or sat in a Fulham coffee
shop (with no intention of
exercising whatsoever).
The popularity of the
style codes of Athleisure
have made an impact
on high-end brands col-
lections too. MISBHV,
Poland’s hottest high-end
streetwear brand of the
late 2010s, is seeing
worldwide success with
its futuristic skin-tight
tops and bottoms. In
addition, Off-White (the
top brand on the Lyst
Index, a quarterly ranking
of fashion’s hottest brands
and products) has slowly
integrated more athleisure
into their collections.
Iconically and early on,
Off-White’s Creative
Director, Virgil Abloh,
sent Naomi Campbell
down the runway wearing
cycling shorts styled
with double-breasted suit
jacket as part of their
collection inspired by
Princess Diana.
The increase in the
number and success of
athleisure brands is, of
course, due to the increase
in popularity of health
and fitness culture, and
customers are prepared
to splash some serious
cash on letting people
know they go to the
gym. Furthermore, as the
price point and perceived
luxury of these items goes
up, athleisure brands are
being seen more and more
outside of the gym as
well as inside. Of course,
we could say that athlei-
sure’s popularity is in its
comfort, its functionality,
and that having clothing
you can wear at work,
at the gym, and down at
the pub reflects the needs
of modern city-living.
However, this doesn’t
encapsulate Athleisure’s
appeal completely. People
used to go to the gym in in-
expensive clothing or just
an old t-shirt and shorts
stuffed at the bottom of
their work bag, changing
into the appropriate
outfit for the appropriate
occasion. What people
never used to do was
invest in clothing in order
to show off that they went
to the gym, or to look
good while exercising. If
it wasn’t simply a worn
t-shirt and some loose
shorts, it was something
from Sports Direct, JD
Sports. At most you might
see labels like Nike or
Adidas but definitely not
“designer” level garments
from a 100 billion dollar
sector.
The choices we make
when we buy clothing is
never a purely pragmatic
one based on functionality
of that clothing. Whether
it’s an intention to buy
our favourite band’s
merchandise or we’re
subconsciously drawn to
an item on the rail, we
make choices about what
we wear because we feel
it represents something
about us which we want
the world to know. When
asked about people
wanting to do away with
fashion completely, Bill
Cunningham, the late
fashion photographer,
responded by saying it
could not be done simply
because “it [fashion] is
the armour to survive
everyday life”. The
problem with athleisure
is that it is expressing
something banal and
everyday - merely that the
wearer goes to the gym
(or pretends to). It doesn’t
express any insight about a
person’s music or hobbies,
their political leanings
or ideals or even their
favourite sports team. Our
clothing choices don’t
have to reflect something
about us, but like it or not
they do because they are
a choice. The importance
of fashion as an art form
is unique because it can
tap into and embody what
people think and want
to say about themselves
directly. Athleisure rep-
resents a step towards
everyone wearing the
same clothing everywhere
everyday like some kind
of grey-scale dystopia.
Athleisure, in my
opinion, doesn’t stand
for much. The only thing
it reflects about con-
temporary culture is our
preoccupation with health
and fitness and how we
lack the time to go home
and change before and
after going to the gym.
Consider any other decade
in living memory, each has
its defining sub-culture
and their corresponding
ideals. Think about punks,
teddy-boys, hippies,
casuals, emos, greasers,
and skinheads. London
was at the centre of these
and when you walked
down the street you would
see people from these
groups. Whether you as-
sociated with them or not,
these groups had passions
and interests that they
wanted to express through
their clothing, and this
shaped fashion history.
Looking around now, I
hope that my generation
isn’t only remembered by
people doing Pilates and
push-ups.
