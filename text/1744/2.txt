The UCU Should Have Come to
College Council Earlier
O
n Tuesday,
the Union
Council voted
to support the
UCU’s strike action in a
landslide vote of 29-1,
with one abstention.
This is in solidarity
with the position they
took two years ago. The
Union and the UCU,
as a student and trade
union respectively, have
a cooperative history
– and that’s naturally a
very positive thing in
terms of influencing the
College and generating
pressure from both the
staff and student sides.
The UCU is right to
strike, in my view. Prom-
ises made have been let
down with regards to pen-
sions and the establish-
ment of the JEP two years
ago. That the College
imposed a below-inflation
pay rise in a time when
their President receives
a total remuneration of
over £500,000 (including
her free £115,000-per-
year flat on campus) and
they are generating high
revenue via fossil fuel
investment and selling off
chunks of campuses on a
yearly basis seems quite
outrageous.
I would, too, be very
frustrated, and should less
drastic action fail I too
would be inclined toward
collective action methods.
So I personally support
the UCU’s decision, and
the Union’s solidarity
with them. I feel comfort-
able putting that out there
as a personal view.
However, I do not think
either decision is without
criticism. So let me be
clear: the below is the crit-
icism only. There is plenty
of positive to say for both
parties as well.
I’ll start with the
Union’s declaration of
support. Personally, I
feel that too few Council
members stood up and
made a fuss about how
negatively this impacts
their students. While, yes,
the long-term ramifica-
tions of poor staff treat-
ment will lead to negative
outcomes for students as
well, the fact of the matter
is that it is current students
who will suffer for it. We
will have students on
3-year courses who have
seen strike action affect
two-thirds of their degree
years, adding undue stress
to an already tumultuous
and challenging course
and lifestyle. That should
have been emphasised
more heavily by their
representatives.
While support should
be given to the UCU in
their time of need, the
cost to students should be
a stronger consideration
for the Union members,
who seemed too eager to
discard that in favour of
some long-term ‘greater
good’.
However, I think they
are only partially to blame
for that situation. This is
because the choice they
were realistically faced
with was no choice at all.
In Michael McGarvey’s
own words, as he spoke to
me last week, students are
being “held hostage”.
This is why striking
on teaching is effective:
it damages students, so
the students complain to
the College, and that puts
pressure on the College
to budge its position. It’s
effective, sure, but obvi-
ously morally dubious.
What it amounts to is
using a group of people,
damaging them and their
education, robbing them
of the financial input
they’ve given to their
degrees, and all against
their will while they have
no say.
So the choice the
Union was faced with
on Tuesday was “this is
happening whether you
like it or not; so choose
between it happening
and you supporting us,
or it happening and you
not supporting us.” The
choice in that situation
is obvious. As a hostage,
you can co-operate, or
you can choose not to, but
in the end what happens
to you is the same. May as
well co-operate.
You cannot offer
true consent or support
to something that will
happen regardless of
whether you choose it
or not. You can, at most,
choose to ‘not mind’. In
no other situation would
this be considered accept-
able, and would certainly
not be greeted so eagerly.
How do you avoid this
situation? How do you
garner solidarity between
the students and staff of
this community to stand
up for one another? Well,
firstly, you talk. You ask
for support and consent in
a genuine way. I feel that
the UCU failed to do that
here.
I would have suggested
instead talking to the
Union Council before
taking the strike ballot.
The Council would have
supported the action,
almost without question.
It would arguably have
strengthened the UCU’s
internal campaign for
strikes to take place,
with the freely given
support and consent of the
students’ representatives
taking away guilt from
academic staff members
who were on the fence
about damaging their
students’ education.
Bringing in students
sooner also allows for
actual joint student action
to be organised. As it
is, you won’t see many
(if any) students on the
picket lines shouting their
support, because it was
left so late. The support as
it stands now will be token
at best, a PR statement for
the Union and UCU.
So it makes logical
sense there. It increases
the effectiveness of that
partnership.
But the most important
thing is that that support
would truly have meant
something symbolically.
The support given now
is the co-operation of a
hostage, not an agreement
based on equal respect
and mutual partnership.
Students are being used,
and they’ve accepted
this magnanimously, but
that’s not how respectful
partnerships are born.
Rather than stoically
accepting a sacrifice to our
education and choosing to
stand in solidarity with
the staff who, themselves,
are sacrificing pay to be
on the picket line… well,
we’re instead left with a
situation where it’s been
robbed away and we’ve
only been left with a
choice to forgive or ‘not
mind’ it, or not.
I don’t think any of this
was deliberate. I think
it was an error of judge-
ment. I raise it not as a
way to combat the strikes,
because I fully support
them – in both symbolic
and practical ways. I could
write just as compelling
an argument piece, using
almost identical logic, for
why the way the College
has acted on local pay
negotiations is wrong
and thus the UCU should
strike. Hell, I have done
that, because the whole
situation contains so many
eerie resemblances to the
halls rent negotiations.
I raise it to dispute the
PR line that students are
in solidarity here. I think
that can only be half-true
given the way things were
handled.
There was no negoti-
ation between staff and
students on this; just im-
position and acceptance.
