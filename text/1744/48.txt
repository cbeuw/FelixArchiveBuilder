T
his week, we
are back with
the water polo
captains (Sasha
is the captain for LUSL
1s and Tom is the captain
for LUSL 2s), because
we all know you can’t
get enough. The topic
is Varsity, as Varsity is
coming up on February
28th. The tension between
ICSWP and ICSM water
polo runs high this year –
with some beef still fresh
in our teams’ minds as
well as the constant con-
sumption of our pool time
for their home games, IC
wants revenge. Last year,
we have witnessed the fall
of some of our best balls to
the medics’ secret weapon
– whether it was lube or
Vaseline still remains to
be seen, but rumour has it
that if you taste the water
of the Ethos pool as time
rolls closer to Varsity, you
might just be able to find
out which one it really
was. Thinking that they
would be slick enough
to win, their plans got
foiled by the rage this
brought out in IC. Even
the jacuzzi team was left
shook. Perhaps that’s why
it almost never works this
year – they might have
just clogged the pipes.
But the story doesn’t
end there. This year,
trying to re-establish a
friendly competition, IC
tried to be cordial and
fun – turns out that the
medics didn’t appreciate it
at all. Not only having had
rearranged games four or
five times, they never
volunteered their pool
time – even if it was their
home game. Preferring to
leech onto IC’s time, they
went a bit too far, making
the BUCS teams want the
LUSL win no less than
LUSL themselves. Only
BUCS play will some
time show who was right
and who was wrong.
But what the Medics
can’t score, they can drink.
They have beat both our
captains last year in the
Captain’s Challenge that
happens after Varsity in
the union. That’s probably
the only event they had
not attempted cheating in,
ngl. Will Sasha and Tom
be up to the challenge this
year? That’s for them to
know and for us to find
out. Very, very soon. For
now, enjoy the banter
from the lovely captains
as they discuss strengths,
bonding and Varsity.
Nastya: What are the
team strengths?
Sasha: Synergy, everyone
knows everyone well
and hypes each other up,
people know what they’re
doing most of the time.
Tom: Shit chat. Petros has
been playing for over 10
years for the team, at this
point he’s probably a part
of the pool. Thanos has
amazing brotherly abil-
ities, Henry’s ability to
make relations with half
of the ladies water polo
squad was useful before he
got a girl. [Gets out team
sheet] Marcus Allen is an
absolute legend. We have
Finlay who, although is
from the north, is actually
an alright guy. Karan, who
never makes it to training
but is always keen for
pub, and Sir Lancemop
as well – our strengths
are not particularly water
polo skills, but rather our
skills at having a good
time I suppose. Our team
spirit, if you may. We may
not get there in style, but
we get there eventually.
No one seems to know
what’s going on but it all
works out.
Nastya:What about
team building?
Sasha: We have a couple
of cans, everyone jokes
around and people enjoy
playing, so the game is
team building in itself.
Tom: We do things like
the LUSL 2s dinner, this
year for the first time we
had LUSL 2s ACC pres.
Shit chat on the group
chat also helps. I think
what’s most important is
that past LUSL 2s people
regularly come back to
play – it makes a lasting
impression on freshers,
that this is not just a club
you join throughout uni,
it’s something to be a part
of for years to come really.
I may as well just say
that the captain holds it
together through his ban-
terous, awful, humourless
shit chat.
Nastya: What’s is the
rivalry with the Im-
perial Medics team?
What is your outlook
on this year’s Varsity?
Sasha: We’ve got no
issues against the medics.
Their 2s captain, Nick,
got annoyed when I faked
and placed a ball in their
net. Demetris didn’t want
to use their pool time and
always kept using ours.
They’ve had to re-
schedule a match four
times. I don’t think they
managed to change it on
BUCS play, so I think
it’s an automatic forfeit,
since they can’t change
the score anymore. So
really, nothing major. As
for Varisty, I’ve only been
here for two years, but I
believe the 1s always won,
so I will try to uphold this
streak this year.
Tom: Varsity is going
to be good this year, it
always is very fun. The
medics know they’ll never
win, so they play dirty –
last year they vaselined
themselves. It was really
disgusting. And then they
were playing human ball
curling or whatever. His-
torically, we’ve never lost
Varsity. It’s always good
fun, but the play does get
quite dirty, with some
banter on the side. One
thing I can say, is what the
medics lack in their water
polo ability, they make up
with their drinking abili-
ties in the union. I credit
them to that.
And that is it from
both me and the guys!
Come watch the game on
February 28th
, or if you’re
interested to play, contact
the club to participate
in the soon and coming
McComish Tournament,
where teams who have
never played polo before
get a few polo players
and compete against each
other. Watch this space.
