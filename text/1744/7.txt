How responsible are you for what you wrote
or thought as a student?
Arts Editor Vaidhiswaran Ramesh struggles with the juxtaposition of being both a student
and publishing one’s views in a student newspaper

N

pers have
historically
been drivers of
public discourse, shaping
and giving voice to the
context and dialogue of
the day. From toppling
regimes, to starting and
preventing wars, the
effect of the written word
has been profound and far
ranging.
Even with the advent
of new technologies
and non-conventional
modes of informational
broadcasting, newspapers
continue to be the flag
bearersofthefourthestate,
both objectively and in
the publics’ view. This
disproportionate purview,
in an age of Facebook and
Twitter, means that these
institutions carry a great
responsibility to publish
high quality journalism.
A university newspaper
is no exception to any
of this, as its role is no
different from that of any
national publication: To
serve and inform our read-
ership and to provide a
platform for discourse on
a wide range of germane
issues. Sitting at the
crossroads of the society
at large and students,
these publications are
uniquely poised to capture
the pulse of the next gen-
eration of voters in a way
that national publications
seldom can. The com-
bination of an engaged
and diverse audience, a
generously open mindset
and, a degree of editorial
freedom, often allows
a university newspaper
to rise to this challenge.
In the past, student run
norms and sometimes
even permanently
changing the political
landscapes in their respec-
tive countries. The role
of student publications
like The Johns Hopkins
Newsletter in contributing
to the narrative around
the Black Lives Matter
movement in the United
States of America in
the last decade cannot
be emphasized enough.
Felix’s ongoing campaign
to critically investigate
Imperial’s dubious in-
vestments in the tobacco,
fossil fuel and, armaments
industry is another notice-
able example of a student
publication taking the
lead on changing societal
landscapes.
But as much as univer-
sity newspapers strive to
meet the rigour of a print
publishing, it is an inevi-
table reality that at the end
of the day, the editorial
desk and writer positions
are filled by none other
than students themselves,
often with partial or a
fleeting understanding
of the world around. To
be clear, a student writer
is neither expected to
graduate from Sandhurst
to argue about the neces-
sity of the Iraq war nor
are they expected to have
designed the St Paul’s Ca-
thedral to articulate how
unimaginative the Huxley
building is. Afterall the
purpose of a university
education is to provide
a safe space for students
while they form their
views on the world. But
the expectation of high
standards from the print
press inevitably bleeds
across to university pub-
lications as well, meaning
that a certain degree of
political correctness and
adherence to conventional
thought is expected.
To be clear, no reputa-
ble university publication
enforces barriers to entry
based on these metrics
and do their best to reflect
student discourse however
diverse and non-main-
stream it might be (recent
exchanges in Felix on the
Hong Kong protests is tes-
timony to that). However,
no publication is frozen in
time and history suggests
that contextual latitude
is seldom offered to
publications in hindsight.
Generally true for any
opinionated piece, this is
highly relevant in the case
of a university publication
with its student body of
contributors. A student
is thus often forced to
confront a choice every
time he picks a pen…
whether to find a per-
manent voice for their
opinion unashamedly or
give into second thoughts
and concerns of reprisals
and back down.
It is an open secret
today that prospects of
employability are tied
with one’s political and
philosophical perspective
where outspoken views
running against main-
stream thought are often
seen as a liability for
the company. With buzz
human resource terms
like ‘culture fits’ gaining
traction, such practices
are only keen to increase.
As a result, every writer
in the digital age thinks
twice (or ought to) before
sending a piece out to
an editor, more so if the
piece is political, societal
or controversial in nature.
Editorials Boris Johnson
penned in the late 90s were
in vogue decades later,
with political opponents
and media houses trying to
use them to influence the
narrative around the 2019
UK elections. Another
example can be seen in
America where senator
Ron Paul tried in vain for
decades to disassociate
himself from the racist
contents of newsletters he
published in the later half
of the 20th century. These
case studies testify to the
potency and longevity
of the written word and
in such a climate, it is
not hard to understand
the anxiety of university
students when it comes to
voicing their unabridged
thoughts, lest they be mis-
understood or even worse,
they come back to haunt
them in the future.
To be fair, I am not
just attacking political
correctness or addressing
the woke culture within
this context. These are
reasonable consequences
of centuries of exploita-
tion of a free press by
radical entities to find
space for detrimental and
marginalizing narratives
and are thus certainly
necessary today as mental
checkpoints for any writer
to ensure equity. The fault
lines I wish to address
