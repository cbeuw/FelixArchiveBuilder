Imperial College Fashion Bible: Episode 2
T
he other day, a
friend told me
that they “don’t
get fashion” in
the same tone that I say
I “don’t get sports”. But
whereas I can refuse to
step foot on a football field
ever again and denounce
any sporting activity, we
don’t have that luxury
with fashion. From the
moment you’re born and
your parents wrap you in
off-brand Pampers (brand
loyalty is the enemy of
progress), you’ve been
a player in the game and
you’ll stay a player until
you’re cremated or the
clothes they bury you in
get eaten by worms. So if
you have to be a player,
you best start looking for
your team. Here are an-
other few to get your head
in the game.
It’s Not All Business
Blazers really are
everywhere, and I’m not
just talking about those
anxiously rushing to job
interviews. The uniform
of those that take life a
little too seriously, you’ve
probably seen at least one
person casually strolling
in a suit every time you’re
on campus.
With blazers in every
shade, material and
pattern you can imagine,
there is a blazer out there
to match anything and
the blazer wearing gang
won’t let you forget it.
They think that adding
a blazer to anything will
render the outfit smart-
casual so expect blazer
with evening dress, blazer
with Hawaiian shirt,
blazer with shorts, and the
classic blazer with jeans.

Where can’t you get a
blazer these days?
Flourescent Adoles-
cence
So you’ve finally
ventured out of your black
and white wardrobe with
a pop colour. Empowered
by your choice of pat-
terned socks, you’ve gone
crazy with power and
decided to take it to the
next level. If one bright
colour could be that good,
then surely wearing all the
bright colours will allow
you to achieve Godhood.
Whether it’s an all-out
neon bodycon or just some
flashy boots, whatever
your staple clothing item
is, it now exists in an array
of neon.

Man in the Mirror
Ever felt overshadowed
in a group photo? We
know how important those
Instagram photos are and
we’ve got the perfect
solution for you. The best
part? No one will even see
it coming until the flash
hits. Perfect for those too
shy to be flaunting neon
24/7 but want to be a little
experimental. You could
be both the guy or gal in
a dull shade of grey no
one notices AND the one
taking the spotlight and
shining brighter than an
Imperial graduate’s future.
I’m telling you reflective
clothing are magical. One
final friendly reminder,
while reflective clothing
is flash photography
friendly, foundation with
SPF is not.
