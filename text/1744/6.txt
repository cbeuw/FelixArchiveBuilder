We Are All Living

I
t is undeniable that
we are approaching
a global crisis: each
year we are hit with
more and more news sto-
ries of devastating floods,
fires and other natural
disasters; the population
and life expectancies con-
tinue to increase, causing
food shortages that will
affect the most disadvan-
taged of us. There are
many problems facing
our modern globalised
society, but I would argue
that the most prevalent
of these is that of climate
change. The temperature
of the Earth keeps rising
with greenhouse gasses
being pumped into the
atmosphere by massive
multi-national corpora-
tions, governments and
individuals themselves
at a rate that shows no
sign of slowing down.
Yet, in today’s society, it
seems although the main
method adopted as a
solution is that of liberal
individualism. The idea is
that we as individuals can
solve this crisis by acting
in our own means: going
vegan, buying an electric
car, using a reusable cup
and so on. This is not the
solution that we should
be following as it does
not solve the problems it
purports to. It in fact leads
us into a state of neglect to
the true issue, as I will ex-
plain later. I would argue
that we should focus
on a community-based
approach, working togeth-
er to get the change that
we need and deserve. This
could take different forms,
but the one constant is
acting as a collective.
It has been shown in an
expose by the Guardian
that 20 companies produce
over a third of the world’s
emissions. This fact,
and similar others that
we hear all time (rising
temperatures and sea
levels etc.), shocks people
to their core and causes a
feeling of powerlessness
towards the situation as a
whole. This often creates
a desire to help make a
change but the main form
of action, that of liberal
individualism, however,
is counterproductive.
The counterproduc-
tivity arises from a neat
ideological reversal that
To try to begin to tackle
the ecological crisis, we
must begin to accept that
we as individuals cannot
make any significant
change. In doing so we
must harness the angst
that this leads to though
utilising all available
options. This may bring
us back into a feeling of
powerlessness but this
feeling is just the infini-
tum of choice. When we
feel our most powerless,
that is when we have
the greatest capacity for
change. Change never
comes to the content.
We must act together to
turn the blame off us as
individuals purely and
onto the governments
and corporations that can
actually make significant
difference to the situation.
Although governments
act ‘in the interest of the
voters’, they ultimately
work in the interest of
the markets: if there is
not as much profit to be
made through green initi-
atives, then they won’t be
focussed upon them. If we
want real change, then we
must take the power into
our own hands.
Another problem arises
here however and that is
the social popularity of
the climate movement.
Groups like Extinction
Rebellion had massive
turns out throughout
London and the rest of the
world, but what palpable
change came from this?
The British government
promises a green policy
with investments in
renewables and other sus-
tainable ventures whilst
it is gearing up to invest
up to £6bn in fossil fuels
across the world. This is
because the majority of the
people were there because
it has become a cool trend
to support climate change
protests. Governments
can’t be expected to take
a cause seriously if the
participants aren’t fully
invested. People want to
be seen on social media
marching through the
streets, but they are not
willing to put in the full
effort that it takes to over-
throw the system that has
caused ecological demise.
We must act as one to
remove the capitalist
mode of production that
is destroying our planet
in the name of profits and
turn to a solution that puts
the population of the envi-
ronment above all else.
No one today can deny
that we are rocketing
towards a crisis at an
astonishing speed with
climate scientists telling
us we must act now as by
even 2035 it will be too
late to reverse the damage
that will have been done.
The planet is warming,
droughts and floods along
with wildfires sweep the
globe and all the while the
population continues to
increase with no sign of
stopping. Throughout all
these problems facing us
in our modern life, there
is one idea at a solution
that reigns supreme: the
spectre of liberal individ-
ualism. We should push to
decentralise power out of
Westminster and into the
hands of the people, which
is only truly possible
through civil disobedience
and revolutionary tactics.
If we really want a chance
at a future in this world,
we need to break free of
the ideological chains that
hold us down and act as
one to fight against the
powers that be.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH LIBERALS!!!!!!!!// Piqsels
acts in favour of the
corporations mentioned
above and ultimately the
governments that support
them. Blame for the situa-
tion that we find ourselves
in is placed solely onto
the individual, giving
rise to the false narrative
that the only way that the
planet can be saved is if
individuals choose to act
differently. Individualism
grants us freedom to make
a change, to put all our
recycling in the correct
bin, to choose oat milk
over dairy and to take
public transport instead
of private. This, however,
is a false freedom though
that leaves us with only a
few choices of how to act
and all of these are against
ourselves.
Now, I am not saying
that we should not still be
carrying out these actions,
but that we should be
aware of what this type of
action leads to. In making
these small changes to
our individual life, we
remove the guilt from
ourselves without making
any change to the system
that propagates this
problem. This removal
of guilt also leads to a
removal of decision, we
are told what we need to
do: don’t think, just act. In
this sense we are living,
as existential philosopher
Jean-Paul Sartre would
say, in ‘bad faith’. Simply,
this is a self-deception that
removes the existential
dread of true free choice
that is part of the human
condition. Even if we
know that these changes
won’t make a meaningful
impact, we act this way
anyway because it is the
easiest way to forget the
problem by thinking that
we are solving it.
