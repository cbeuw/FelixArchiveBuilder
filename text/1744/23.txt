Circles - Mac Miller’s Posthumous Masterpiece
Lastmonth,wewereblessedwithanotheralbumofmaterialfromthelategreatMacMiller,anartistwhosetragic
death ended his impressive, maturing trajectory.
I
n January 2020, we
received the final
instalment in Mac
Miller’s legacy, an
album posthumously re-
leased following his tragic
death in September 2018.
Circles is comprised of 12
mostly unfinished songs,
recorded whilst he was
creating his critically ac-
claimed album Swimming,
released just a month
before his death. Circles
was intended to comple-
ment Swimming, with
the two being released
as a conceptual pair-
‘Swimming in Circles’.
Much like Swimming,
and contrary to his earlier
work, Circles is very re-
flective, with softly sung
despondent melodies and
melancholic lyrics.
The lyrics that begin
the album, “Well, this
is what it look like right
before you fall”, sung
over the opening song’s
slow, repetitive instru-
mental, set the scene for
the album - an introspec-
tive look into a struggling
mind. The entire song is
dedicated to his unstable
mental state. When he
sings “We’re watchin’ the
world fallin’ down” he
can only be referring to
his psyche, as he battles
the chaos of his own mind
with an ultimately fatal
drug addiction. Even in
the next song, ‘Com-
plicated’, a comparably
upbeat and happy track,
Mac stresses over the
never-ending complica-
tions of everyday life. He
does this again on ‘Blue
Worlds’, the album’s
second single, which
features an instrumental
that could easily be from
his early party rapper
days. Despite rapping “Circles in a
masterpiece,
created by
one of this
generation’s
great
musicians”
about life’s tribulations,
the song features a trippy
chopped up vocal sample,
produced by Disclosure’s
Guy Lawrence, making
it a standout track among
the reclusiveness of the
other songs.
‘Good News’, the
lead single and usual
fan favourite, is the
album’s most complete,
and arguably best,
song. Similar to many
of the themes seen on
Swimming, Mac discusses
how everybody around
him only wants to hear
that he’s good, encour-
aging him to repress the
negative thoughts he con-
stantly has. The chorus,
“Good news… that’s all
they want to hear / No,
they don’t like me when
I’m down”, explicitly
states this, and reinforces
Mac’s estrangement from
the world. The third
verse, like other moments
throughoutthealbum,sees
Mac seemingly anticipate
his own death, allowing
us to question if it really
was accidental. He sings:
“There’s a whole lot more
for me waiting on the
other side”. We get the
impression that he finds
normal life so unbearable,
only death can bring him
peace. Although I don’t
believe Mac intentionally
killed himself, I do think
he carelessly took drugs
the night he died, knowing
that if he could intoxicate
himself enough he could
escape reality in one way
or the other.
“Everybody’s gotta
live / And everybody’s
gonna die”. This phrase
is repeated throughout
‘Everybody’, which
seems to morph David
Bowie and late rapper
XXXTENTACION into
4 minutes of disheartened
realisation. The song is
actually a cover of Arthur
Lee’s song of the same
name, but Mac takes a
new approach, producing
his own instrumental and
adding an original heart-
felt piano section before
the final chorus. ‘Hand
Me Downs’ is the only
song to feature another
another vocal artist. The
start of Baro Sura’s chorus
doesn’t seem to fit and
overlaps with the verses,
but we can only assume
Mac didn’t get a chance to
record his own chorus, and
his family (who played
a large role in finishing
and releasing the album)
turned to friend Baro for
help. However, the vocal
style nicely complements
the song and creates
another excellent track.
One of my favourite
songs is ‘That’s On Me’.
Mac seems to be taking
the blame for something.
Although the lyrics are
quite ambiguous, he is
perhaps referring to the
spiralofdeclinehislifehas
taken. The backing track
features a fingerpicked
guitar melody alongside
piano, drums and bass, all
played by Jon Brion. This
song is another where Mac
seems to foreshadow his
own death - it’s as if he’s
accepting responsibility
for his eventual overdose.
“Don’t wait around” and
“I’ll cut the strings” are
lyrics that reinforce this,
suggesting that when he
dies, it will be his own
choice.
Despite being incom-
plete, Circles is still a
masterpiece, created by
one of this generation’s
great musicians. His loss
is tragic, but although he
is no longer with us, his
music always will be. If
you haven’t listened to
Circles or Mac Miller in
general, I suggest you
listen to Swimming first,
followed by Circles, to
appreciate the work in its
entirety.
