Not Quite A Long Shot Afterall
Imperial researchers design a prototype vaccine for COVID-19 using cutting edge RNA vaccination technology –
ready for animal tests after just two months, it’s the fastest vaccine development pathway to date

o you remem-
ber the Zika
outbreak in
2015, which
cast a cloud over the
Brazil 2016 Olympics?
What about the Ebola
epidemic the year before
in 2014? Can you think
back to 2009 when Swine
Flu broke out, or the bird
flu scare just before? Even
if we’re just talking novel
coronaviruses, we’ve
faced the SARS outbreaks
of the early noughties,
and MERS in 2012. The
most recent coronavirus,
COVID-19, is the third of
its kind since the turn of
the century.
COVID-19 has made
global headlines for a
number of reasons: apart
from being a new disease,
unlike its predecessors,
SARS and MERS, it’s
infectious without the
presence of symptoms
– not to mention the
alarming death toll it’s
racking up. But what is
truly frightening about
COVID-19 is that it is
simply one of a number
of infectious diseases that
have epidemic potential.
With a view towards
an increasingly globalised
world, in 2014, the World
Health Organisation
(WHO) chose 11 infec-
tious diseases that posed
a high global health risk.
They set up the Coalition
of Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations to oversee
vaccine development for
these handpicked threats.
However, a recent cost
analysis published in The
Lancet found that to bring
vaccines for these 11
diseases to clinical trials
faced a cost of up to £3.85
billion for each successful
candidate.
And on top of pro-
hibitive costs, or the
difficulty of identifying a
good vaccine candidate,
they can take almost a
decade to go from bench
to bedside. Professor
Robert Shattock, Head
of Mucosal Infection
and Immunity within the
Department of Medicine
at Imperial, explains.
“Most vaccines would
take, you know, maybe
5 years in the discovery
phase, and at least 1-2
years to manufacture and
get to clinical trials.
This is partly because
vaccine development
has to follow a lengthy
pathway involving set
preclinical and clinical
checkpoints to test its
safety and efficacy – and
the challenges start almost
immediately. Vaccine
candidate selection can
take several different
approaches. Traditional
vaccines, like the flu jab,
may use dead versions of
the infectious pathogen
to elicit an immune
response, or like the
measles, mumps and
rubella (MMR) vaccine,
use inactivated, albeit
live, pathogens. Newer
vaccinations identify a
specific part of the path-
ogen, such as a protein
subunit, or a toxin the
pathogen produces, that
can be used instead of the
whole pathogen and will
still generate an immune
response. Deciding which
approach to take requires
some understanding of the
behaviour of the pathogen
and its interaction with
our immune system;
knowledge that is in
short supply when facing
sudden, novel epidemics.
Luckily, with COVID-
19, we wouldn’t be setting
off blind. COVID-19
may be the name of the
disease, but the virus has
been given the title SARS-
CoV-2 – a new strain of
SARS. And, as Professor
Shattock describes, this
means we have some
clues. “Because this new
coronavirus is related to
SARS, and with SARS
we know which part of
the virus was targeted
effectively by the immune
system, we’re immediate-
ly able to identify the only
protein that’s expressed on
the surface of the virus.”
So, once the vaccine
candidate is selected,
what next? Well, quite
a lot, actually. First,
this needs to actually be
made into a prototype –
overcoming issues like a
protein forming the wrong
3D structure in isolation
or stabilising the vaccine
outside of its natural envi-
ronment. Only whenthese
issues are resolved can
preclinical tests in animals
be conducted to check its
safety profile.
If given the all-clear,
the vaccine can be taken
forward to clinical tests
– but these are still not
straightforward. Clinical
tests are divided into
Phases I to IV, each mon-
itoring different aspects.
Phase I trials confirm
the animal test results
by checking it is safe in
humans. Phase II involves
slightly larger trials, eval-
uating the efficacy of the
vaccine against artificial
infection, while Phase III
follows this up with larger
scale trials in natural dis-
ease conditions. Phase IV
trials finish the pipeline by
monitoring the long-term
safety and efficacy of the
vaccine.
So, looking down the
syringe barrel, vaccina-
tion doesn’t sound like
much use in emergencies
like COVID-19. Or is it?
Professor Shattock and
his team are working on
something new that could
be the answer – RNA
vaccination.
“We’ve got the kind
of technology to be able
to generate a vaccine
with a speed that’s never
been realised before,” he
explains. “We’ve made
our first prototype vac-
cines… and within two
weeks we’ll have them
in our first animal exper-
iments.” This vaccine
has the potential to be in
human trials shortly after
– slashing that lengthy
process to four months.
If successful, this will be
the first time a vaccine
has ever been brought to
market so quickly.
RNA vaccination goes
one step further than
even the latest technique
in vaccinology, DNA
vaccination.
DNA vaccinations are
a relatively new concept
– direct injection of DNA
sequences that code for
a pathogen antigen – it
works by causing our cells
to uptake the DNA, read

“Most vaccines
would take
maybe 5
years in the
discovery
phase, and
at least 1-2
years to
manufacture
and get to
clinical trials”
“COVID-19 is
simply one
of a number
of infectious
diseases that
have epidemic
potential”
the sequence, and gener-
ate the protein themselves.
This is quickly recognised
as foreign and an immune
response is kick-started.
RNA vaccination aims
to cut out the middleman
by injecting RNA, from
which a protein can be
directly built – and with
much less risk, as our
DNA remains untouched.
With this technique,
Professor Shattock and his
team estimate there could
be a vaccine manufactured
and ready for widespread
use early next year.
He concludes, remark-
ing: “This is definitely
the future for these kinds
of viral outbreaks (…)
We would hope that
this ability to synthesise
vaccines could quickly
be established in every
country across the world,
so as soon as there’s
an outbreak, everyone,
everywhere could access
the vaccine.”
