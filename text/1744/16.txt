The good...
. . . t h e b a d . . .
the best and worst looks
have been highlighted
here as well as the
“sexy”. The latter does
not refer to questionably
fully clothed men stand-
ing alongside Imperial’s
answer to Victoria’s
Secret models but rather
fun and entertaining
moments throughout the
show.
C
alling on the
talent of small
designers, and
by summoning
the model that lives in
each and every Imperial
student, the ICFS fash-
ion show was an overall
success. This charity
event raised money for
ClientEarth. Some of
...and
the sexy!
The fabulous bold patterns
by Kwame Koranteng
were among the best
looks of the night. Con-
trasting with the block
coloured waistcoat helped
ensure the patterns were
effective without over-
powering the look.
This piece which formed
part of a more extensive
lingerie line by Nearer
the Moon was one of the
highlights. The differ-
ent textures and rising
towards the neck eleve-
taed the simple lingerie
to something special.
Critisism can be made
about this entire walk,
not because it was “a bit
riske” as your aunt Karen
would say, but rather bec-
uase of the men standing
alongside them in an al-
most voyeuristic way. In
future, keeping a balance
will help stop perpetu-
ating sexist conotations.
The elmer the elephant-es-
que colourful trousers
are fun and stylish at
a stretch however the
pom-poms top is deep-
ly unsettling. Maybe try
pipe cleaners next time!
This overall look was ac-
tually extremly innovative
however the shear materi-
al used at crotch level con-
fused the flow of the outfit
causing a disconnect be-
tween the top and bottom.
Other looks which used
the same materials were
effective but this one, es-
pecially with the trans-
parent window, didn’t
work. Not sure about the
loo roll headpiece either...
Much like the pom-
poms, the aesthetics did
not sit well with me. The
make-up and hair here,
as well as a fierce look
on the model almost
dsitract you from this.
The theme of the show was
loosely followed through
with moments like this
Billie Jean pose as well
as some fun walks with
Beyoncé booming in the
background. While some
models kept straight faces,
some broke their charac-
ter and couldn’t help lip-
sync a little. These were
some of the most joyous
moments of the show
and maybe something to
be encouraged in future.
Eventually, some of
the sexiest men on cam-
pus did strip down and
walk the walk restor-
ing the gender balance.
Special guests the Im-
perielles and Funkology
performed as well. These
were great additions and
elevated the whole show.
A special mention has to
be made to the dancers
in Funkology, wow, they
really stole the show!
