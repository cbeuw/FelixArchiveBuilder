Jollof Rice: Settling the Debate
FOOD
Mariam Jallow
Food Writer
I have decided to
address head-first the age
old feud between many
west African countries.
The tomato based rice
dish, commonly known
as jollof rice is prevalent
across west Africa, with
recipes differing slightly
between countries leading
to a heavy debate about
which country makes the
best jollof. If you know
any westAfricans then I’m
sure you’re fully aware
of this feud but if not,
then proceed to read the
rest of this heavily biased
article where I’ll explain
why I believe Gambia is
deserving of this title. I
want to present a voice for
a country which is largely
underrepresented in this
debate. Gambia, the literal
smiling coast of Africa is
the smallest country in
mainland Africa which I
believe has contributed to
many other, much larger
west African countries,
establishing a louder
voice in this debate and
neglecting the very valid
rights that Gambians have
to this dish.
Before going into the
technicalities of which
country makes the best
jollof, I think it’s impor-
tant to cover the origins
of the dish. Many west
Africans engaged in the
debate probably aren’t
aware of this but the dish
actually originated in
senegambia- a confedera-
tion between Senegal and
Gambia. People traveling
and spreading out across
west Africa resulted in
the different regional va-
rieties we have now. This
dish being called jollof
is derived from the name
of the Wolof people who
originally created the dish.
In Gambia, we call jollof
rice benachin which liter-
ally translates to ‘one pot’,
denoting the method of
cooking where everything
is essentially cooked in
the same cooking pot. I’m
not claiming that because
we created it it means we
make the best one but I
do think it’s important to
give credit where it’s due
which many people fail to
do regarding this matter.
You may be wondering
why I do not include
Senegal with Gambia
as having the best jollof
but that’s because I have
personally tested Sene-
galeese benachin when I
visited Senegal and in the
nicest way possible, the
senegaleese jollof lacked
the flavour and spice that
we have in Gambia. We
might be close together
in distance but when it
comes to benachin, we are
on completely different
continents.
As mentioned before,
“There are
variations in
the cooking
of jollof rice
between
different
regions ” “To many non
Africans this
might seem
like a lot of
fuss over
simple but
it is a sense
of pride for
many”
there are variations in
the cooking of jollof rice
between different regions
resulting in subtle changes
in the taste, flavour and
appearance of the dish.
Gambians begin cooking
benachin by frying
onions, tomato paste and
scotch pepper past the
stage of caramelization to
the point where it nearly
appears burnt; adding a
deep smoky flavour to the
rice. Anyone who’s ever
cooked it knows the level
of patience and precision
required; it’s definitely not
something you can whip
up in half an hour. This is
then proceeded by adding
the rice and cooking it
within this caramelized
paste. On the other hand,
jollof requires chopped
tomatoes instead of the
puree and sauteing is done
for considerably less time.
This difference results in
benachin having a much
darker colour and a differ-
ent flavour. Another small
but significant difference
is the fact that benachin
is usually made with short
grain rice whereas jollof
predominantly uses long
grain rice. This doesn’t
necessarily affect the taste
but it is a difference none-
theless. Although there
are similarities in that
both jollof and benachin
is usually served with a
chicken, beef or fish side,
we differ on the additional
sides. Benachin usually
comes with a selection of
vegetables such as carrots,
cassava, cabbage and
aubergine. Jollof however
goes beyond this and can
also include coleslaw,
salad and plantain. Whilst
plantain has its place in
the Gambian diet, that
place is not alongside
a savoury rice dish, but
each to their own.
To many non Africans
this might seem like a lot
of fuss over simple but
it is a sense of pride for
many west Africans. As
our national dish, it holds
the same place that fish
and chips and curry holds
for many british people.
All pettiness aside, I do
think that it’s nice to see
all west african countries
united in their love for this
dish; even if it’s conveyed
with a little bit of hostility.
In all honesty, there is
no true way of knowing
who actually makes the
best version of jollof as
recipes can differ even
between people who live
on the same street. When
I say Gambian’s make the
best jollof I mean that the
version my mum makes
is better than the jollof
rice I tasted from a doggie
restaurant. Every family
has their own unique
recipe, the benachin my
paternal grandma makes
is different from the
recipe my maternal great
grandmother passed down
to my mother. They’re
both different but both
still great and I’m sure
the same can be said for
each regional variation.
Honestly it’s all love; and
anyway, we all know that
Jamie Oliver’s ‘authentic’
jollof recipe trumps them
all.
