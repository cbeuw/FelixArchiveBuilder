Felix’s Super Accurate Simulation
of What the 2020 Presidential
Election is Going to Look Like
Or, FSASW2020PEGLL for short.
Can you win the U.S. Presidency?
Beloved former
candidate Andrew
Yang endorses
you. Skip ahead.
Gwyneth Pal-
trow
endorses
you. Move back
3 points.
Someone
makes a viral
meme out of you.
Move ahead 2
points.
People are
getting bored of
you. Skip your
next turn.
You are once again
asking for everyone’s
financial support.
Move ahead 3 points.
You eat a bacon
sandwich
wrongly. Move
back 3 points.
You’re running
low
on funds.
Move ahead if
you’re a
billionare.
Choose your fighter
From your results to the quiz on the
previous page, carefully (using round-
edge scissors) cut out the politician you
ended up with. They shall be the one to
lead America into your ideal society.
Figure out your starting point
Poor people (non-billionaires) gotta
start at the beginning.
But if you’re a billionare then your
starting point is your net worth (in
billions), divided by the number of
workers you’re currently exploiting (in
millions), plus the number of TV ads
you’re planning to air (too many).
If your Putin and nobody knows how
much you’re worth, then feel free to
start wherever you want because you’re
probably controlling the race anyway.
