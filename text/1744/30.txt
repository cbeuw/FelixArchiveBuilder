A Vegan’s View On Antinatalism
I
want to start on the
case of re-wilding,
which is gaining
support among
environmentalists today.
Re-wilding is the act
of restoring land to its
natural, uncultivated
state, especially by rein-
troducing locally extinct
species to either lower
the number of an inva-
sive species or a local
species of which the
population has spiraled
out of control, like deer.
This at face value seems
like a good idea; by re-
storing a place’s natural
beauty we would be in-
creasing the biodiversity
and allowing the land
to return to how nature
intended. However, let’s
first take a step back and
think about the morals
of this.
As a vegan, I simply
seek to reduce the
amount of suffering
I cause as much as
possible or practical,
which includes abstain-

ing from eating animal
products and avoiding
the purchase of animal
derived clothing or
cosmetic products tested
on animals. It’s easy
to see how animals in
the agricultural system
are suffering, but few
recognise the suffering
of wild animals. It must
surely follow, that if we
want to reduce the suf-
fering of farm animals
as much as possible,
then we would want to
do the same for wild
animals. And here lies
the crux of the argument.
By reintroducing a
natural predator, say by
reintroducing the lynx to
Kielder Forest in North-
umberland or wolves to
the Scottish Highlands,
we are increasing the
amount of suffering in
those habitats, whether
it be by the death of
the deer by the wolf or
the starvation of the
wolves if they find no
prey. This obviously
applies to hunting as
well, as killing deer is
we ever going to see
the grey squirrel, or
the American crayfish
disappear? Or is it best
to just leave them, as
the suffering of each
individual squirrel or
crayfish can not be
excused for simply the
reason that they are
from invasive species?
A new ecosystem has
arisen because of these
invasive species, but
who are we to say that
this ecosystem is the
wrong one and that it
must go back to how it
was before? This is an
interesting question for
environmentalists to
consider.
One might say that
this is for the common
good, as increasing bio-
diversity is a good thing,
but why? Take the Lake
district, a UNESCO
World Heritage Site
teeming with natural
beauty, but the hills and
valleys are plain and
bare, due to a teeming
population of deer, and
it has been proposed to
reintroduce wolves to
reduce the deer popula-
tion. What benefit would
having more shrubs
and trees have to the
area? It would be more
aesthetically pleasing
to look at perhaps, and
this may attract more
tourists, although I
doubt it would, and if
anything, many trees
and shrubs would only
obscure the beautiful
open views the lakes
are known for. So, how
can merely making the
area look nicer and more
biodiverse possibly be a
good enough reason to
cause the mass suffering
of animals? The best
thing we can do is do
nothing then, and in the
case of the Lake District
again, let the deer be
controlled by the area’s
carrying capacity.
Obviously we should
do all we can to reduce/
stop biodiversity reduc-
tion like deforestation
in the Amazon Basin or
illegal cetacean fishing,
as this causes a huge
amount of suffering, but
once the biodiversity or
the number individuals
have been lost, it may be
best to not seek to revive
the area and increase the
number of individuals,
as again, this would
cause increased suffer-
ing.
If you take this
argument to its logical
conclusion, it seems that
we would wish there to
be no wild animals at all
and for there to be no
sentient animals left in
existence. This makes
sense as an Earth with no
animals is an Earth with
no suffering and seems a
logical extension of the
aim of veganism, which
is to reduce the demand
for animal products so
less animals are born.
Surely this is the better
than what we have
now. This leads to an
argument for antinatal-
ism, which is the belief
that birth is inherently
a bad thing, and that
one should abstain from
bringing new life into
the world. This could be
argued from the idea of
suffering (especially in
the case of non-human
animals), the ever-ex-
panding human popula-
“As a vegan,
I simply seek
to reduce
the amount
of suffering I
cause as much
as possible or
practical”
“Antinatalism
is the belief
that birth is
inherently
a bad thing,
and that one
should abstain
from bringing
new life into
the world”
clearly causing a high
amount of suffering to
those animals. Hunting
can easily be dismissed
as shooting a few deer
on a regular basis isn’t
going to restore a habitat
to its former glory. Are
“who are we
to say that this
ecosystem
is the wrong
one and that it
must go back”
