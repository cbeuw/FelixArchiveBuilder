that short-term tariffs can
in certain cases help a
nascent domestic industry
catch up with more devel-
oped foreign rivals.
A nutty problem
A helpful case study
is that of Mozambique’s
cashew nut processing
industry, often held up
as a cause célèbre by an-
ti-globalisation activists.
A world-leading cashew
nut producer and process-
ing in the 1960s, eight
thousand jobs were shed
in nut processing factories
after the World Bank in-
structed the Mozambique
government to remove
controls and cut taxes on
the export of raw nuts in
the 1990s, meaning that
companies moved nut
processing abroad to Asia,
where it was cheaper. In
reaction, since 2001 the
government has again
began levying a tax on
the export of raw nuts,
of the order of 18-22%.
Half of the cashew nuts
produced in Mozambique
are now processed domes-
tically, and the industry
has grown to employ
17,000 people. Free trade
economists argue that
the trade-off from this
levy is the neglect of
the 1.3 million families
who grow cashew nuts,
artificially pushing down
the price of their crop.
Yet reality is messier than
economic theory – due
to the poor infrastructure
connecting farmers and
cashew processing facto-
ries, farming smallholders
are often in the pocket
of middlemen traversing
rutted roads to take the
cashews to market. It is
estimated that the 1990s
reforms made the average
predictable.
Tariffs for good
There are some argu-
ments in favour of tariffs.
In poorer countries, they
can be easier to collect
than sales taxes, requiring
collection only at ports.
Giving countries the
ability to impose tariffs,
should they choose, can
help individual countries
feel in control of their
sovereignty, garnering
support for multilateral
free trade agreements.
Tariffs can in certain
cases soften the blow
of change in domestic
industries, protecting
a certain subset of the
population who work in
a declining industry from
dramatic change to their
livelihoods. It is possible

richer by a mere $5.30.
However, it is prudent
to remember that tariffs
also cause economic dis-
tortions which can have
unintended consequences.
In Mozambique, a side
effect of the levy is a
booming black market in
raw cashew nuts out of
the country, helping po-
litically connected cartels
launder money which is
used to ship heroin into the
country. Ultimately, tariffs
are a dangerous weapon
which almost always
harm the country levying
them. They draw workers
and investment towards
protected industries
and away from others,
creating inefficiencies and
reducing productivity. Po-
litically, they encourage
lobbying from powerful
industrial groups seeking
protection. They can
also erode trust between
countries and invite retal-
iatory tariffs from foreign
governments, hurting
exporters. Though they
may temporarily boost a
certain domestic industry,
they make goods and
services more expensive
for a much larger base of
consumers. Unfortunate-
ly, tearing down existing
trade deals and erecting
new trade barriers is far
easier than negotiating
multilateral tariff reduc-
tion. Borrowing Alfred
Nock’s expression, more
sheer robbery for the fore-
seeable future then.
