IC Fencing: Wine, Cheese and Fencing
W
ine, cheese,
and fencing.
There only
really is
one destination that ticks
all the boxes when 20
Imperial fencers go on
tour: Paris. Arriving late
last Thursday, most fenc-
ers only got a short night’s
sleep before an early start
on the Friday morning.
Imperial had both men
and women competing in
all weapons (foil, sabre,
épée); some competing
for their first time, others
with experience of pre-
vious Paris adventures.
Among competing uni-
versities were universities
from across Europe and
the UK. Imperial’s sole
medal of the day was won
by Francesca Cavallo,
finishing on second place
in Women’s Épée after
a tough final against
Caroline Van Eldik from
University of Kent, with
the score 12-15. Other
notable performances
were Filip Aniés and
Hugo Briais both making
it to quarter finals, in
Men’s Épée and Foil
respectively.
of the karaoke screen, a
new rivalry grew against
University of Kent.
Despite heavy efforts to
neutralise our new rivals,
the Kent fencers managed
to secretly deprive IC
Fencing of the Guard:
an item best described
as a holy grail, and the
closest to a mascot that
IC Fencing will ever
have. The theft was not
immediately admitted,
however, leading to ded-
icated searching efforts
by IC Fencing Social Sec
Jake Reynolds – including
a thorough search through
20 garbage bags the day
after – well aware that
a Social Sec who loses
the Guard risks life-long
shaming by the other
members of IC Fencing.
After a long night,
culminating in a 4 am
walk-thru visit to Macies,
it was a tired crowd
who showed up to the
competition bus at 7 am
in the next morning. The
second competition day
featured team competi-
tions, and Imperial Men’s
Épée Team (anchored by
Leicester fencer Idris Ali),
Men’s Foil, Women’s
Épée, as well as King’s
College Women’s Sabre
featuring Imperial fencer
In the Men’s Épée’s first
direct elimination match,
Jake Reynolds got the
chance to regain his
pride, as the opponents
from the University of
Kent promised to give
back the Guard upon an
Imperial victory. Fortu-
nately, Imperial won the
match comfortably, and
the Guard was returned
later that day. Imperial
Men’s Épée continued
to fence well all the way
until the semi-finals,
where they were defeated
by a team of incredibly
good-looking Swiss
dudes from University of
Bern. This performance
was matched by Imperial
Women’s Épée, who also
secured a bronze. Even
better were Sherry Xu’s
Women’s Sabre team and
Imperial Men’s Foil, who
both reached the finals.
Unfortunately, both finals
were lost, with Men’s Foil
being lost against a group
of Hong Kong foilists
from UCL.
The evening after the
competitions featured a
black-tie event with plenty
of dressed-up fencers,
sparkling wine, and an
impressive display of
fireworks. Before taking
