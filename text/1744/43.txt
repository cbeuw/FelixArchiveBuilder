T
he newly
formed Royal
society for the
P r e v e n t i o n
of Cruelty to Denni
(RSPCD) has warned of
a spike in Dennophobic
hate crimes in the after-
math of Storm Dennis
that hit the British main-
land over the weekend.
The storm caused mil-
lions of pounds worth
of property damage but
its greatest effect might
yet turn out to be the be-
smirching of the Dennis
name.
When NegaFelix
spoke to Professor
Poodmann, an expert
in post-crisis crises,
she commented “This
is very common after
disasters for blame to be
transferred onto those
who are connected in
anyway. I got bit by a
dog called Finn once and
now I never eat fish.”
The society has issued
an official definition of
what it calls “Anti-Den-
nis hate speech”. The
list includes: accusing a
Dennis of stealing tram-
polines, making blowing
noises near a Dennis and
pouring water over a
Dennis or onto the floor
in front of a Dennis.
Some politicians have
been quick to condemn
the violence but in other
quarters the response
has been more troubling.
A public inquiry to look
into Anti-Dennitic inci-
dents in the Labour party
has been assembled and
will report to the gov-
ernment next year.
An anonymous
source, speaking from
one of the areas worst
hit by flooding tried to
justify her feeling. “I
have a Dennis friend
so I don’t hate them all
but I think it is pretty
suspicious how he was
on holiday in the Costa
del Sol when this all
happened. Pretty fishy if
you ask me”
If you have been
affected by any of the
issues mentioned in this
article don’t hesitate
to call Samaritans on
+234 810 419 1281 or
the police on 999. Don’t
tolerate hate!
