Lucie Jones live at the Adelphi
L
ucie Jones first
came to promi-
nence through X
Factor in 2009,
where she was eliminated
as a result of a sing-off
against Jedward. Feeling
old yet? Right. Despite
her abrupt elimination,
she has gone on to have
quite the career, starring
in Les Misérables on the
West End, playing the lead
role in Legally Blonde
at Curve Leicester, and
being a part of many
touring companies over
the year, including the
Chinese tour of Ghost the
Musical.
More recently, Jones
won the public vote to
represent the UK in Eu-
rovision. She performed
the powerful ballad
‘Never Give Up on You’,
and ended up finishing
in 15th place, which, all
things considered, was a
pretty massive success for
the UK. Regardless, she
deserved way better.
These days, Jones can
be found performing the
lead role of Jenna eight
times a week in Waitress
at the Adelphi Theatre.
However, for her first solo
West End concert, gone
was the diner set from
Waitress, leaving Jones
front and centre on a bare
stage, with the 22-piece
London Musical Theatre
Orchestra behind her.
Staying onstage for two
hours, Jones’s setlist was,
simply put, a love letter
to musical theatre, and a
celebration of her career.
With songs from Funny
Girl, Rent, Waitress and
more, the evening was
the perfect blend of fun
and gut-wrenching, all
while Jones provided the
audience with a vocal tour
de force. Undoubtedly, the
highlight of the night was
her performance of She
Used to Be Mine from
Waitress. Replacing the
simplistic arrangements
of the source material
with the full-bodied
orchestra, and belting
through the climax of
the song passionately,
Jones managed to leave
the audience in awe. This
is no surprise, as she
manages to do the exact
same thing eight times
a week with the exact
same song in Waitress.
Another highlight was
Jones’s performance of
The Prayer alongside
her special guest John
Owen-Jones. Despite the
extreme cheese the song
manages to serve every
time it is sung, the airtight
harmonies between the
two performers more than
made up for this. The two
were not only perfectly in
sync, they sounded like
one voice. Nay, a perfect-
ly tuned instrument.
The top-notch singing
was intertwined with
anecdotes from Jones’s
career, which, unlike
usual pre-rehearsed
speeches in most concerts,
felt genuine and fun.
Opening the second act
of the show with Into The
Unknown from Frozen 2,
she explained that on her
Instagram poll, a large
number of people request-
ed her to sing Let It Go,
but she decided against it,
because she wasn’t cast
as Elsa in the upcoming
West End production
despite her ‘trying really
really hard’. Instead,
that highly coveted role
went to Samantha Barks,
whom, she explained at
another point during the
show, she met during the
Les Misérables auditions.
They have since gone on
to become really close
friends – according to
Jones, Barks was one of
her bridesmaids! Regard-
less, I think Jones would
make an outstandingAnna
in Frozen. Just sayin’.
Throughout the
evening, Jones received
three well deserved
standing ovations from
the audience. As a fan of
musical theatre, it would
have been impossible
to leave this show un-
impressed even if one
weren’t familiar before-
hand with most of the
songs in the setlist. The
show was recorded to be
released as a live album
later in the year. It would
be criminal to not give it
a stream on Spotify once
it’s out.
Tryst
T
ryst transports
us to the be-
ginning of the
last century, a
few months before Au-
gust 1915. It is set in
London, off of Edgware
Road, and later an un-
named town by the sea.
We meet two charac-
ters: Adelaide Pinchin,
a hard-working naive
shop-girl with a gener-
ous savings account, and
George Love, a charm-
ing penniless serial
fraudster. What happens
between them, as the
title suggests, is a se-
cret affair with thrilling
twists and a surprising
climax.
Writer Karoline Leach
clearly knows how to
explore the duality of per-
spectives of her characters
for comic effect. In a play
ridden with falsehood
and deceit, the audience
becomes a confidant for
both characters, gaining
insights into their thoughts
and an understanding of
the broader implications
of each lie. In that way,
we see Adelaide’s admi-
ration for Mr Love grow
with each story of exotic
diplomatic missions and
fabulous riches, while
his stratagems to dodge
his landlady’s demands
for rent payment grow
increasingly intricate.
We follow them from
the day they first meet,
accompany their secret
encounters, and witness
their relationship growing,
culminating and falling
apart, too late to avoid
serious consequences. As
the play evolves and the
character’s inner demons
come into the light, we
also follow their internal
resistances and personal
growth. Actress Scarlett
Brookes makes a very
convincing Adelaide,
innocent yet astute,
battling dreams and cau-
tiousness, at the same time
thrilled and terrified for
running away into a secret
marriage. Fred Perry,
portraying Mr Love, is
wonderful at keeping the
audience permanently on
the edge of their seats,
second-guessing his in-
tentions and often almost
falling for his traps and
selfish reasoning. The
power dynamics between
them keep changing
unpredictably during the
play, with tense exchanges
contrasting with common
plans, in an intensely
psychological thriller.
The play isn’t without
fault, however. Some dia-
logues are a bit of a stretch
for authenticity, and the
strong, captivating energy
with which the play starts
decays during the longer
scenes. By the end of the
play, I was starting to
feel uncomfortable: not
exactly bored, but with
a feeling that something
was off and they were
taking too long to reach
the forecasted not-ex-
actly-happy-but-a-good-
compromise ending. But
I can forgive it all, thanks
to an absolutely brilliant
final scene. No spoilers,
but I can assure you I was
still feeling the adrenaline
rush on the tube back
home.
