plantain is the most
creative part of the burrito
to me. All of this is in a
tortilla wrap struggling to
contain all the food they
roll into it. It truly is a
meal and a half and at £6
for the chicken variety,
this is one of the best deals
I’ve seen in London.
If you aren’t in the
mood for a carb coma, you
can get their wrap. It is the
same thing as the burrito
but without the jollof rice
- a much lighter option for
those that can’t get behind
their favourite childhood
dish being used in a sacri-
legious manner. They also
have a jollof rice meal that
“Their plantain
is my favourite
part of the
meal. It is the
most creative
part of the
burrito to me”
Perfect to quell your home sickness // @hungry.students
you can get by itself – no
funny business. This is a
big meal so it’s for those
who have an appetite.
The sauces here
are elite. While they
are putting your meal
together, they allow you
to pick from the suya
pepper, spicy mayo and
chilli sauce. Heed my
warning now, no matter
how good you think you
are with spicy food, the
chilli sauce will give you
a run for your money. For
the more adventurous of
you out there, this is a
great challenge and really
brings a new layer to the
meal. Once you get past
the burning sensation, it
can actually taste sweet.
All the meat at Jollof
Mama is halal for the
Muslims out there but
sadly everything is made
with peanut oil for those
of you with nut allergies.
The beef can be made to
the doneness you desire
which is a good indicator
of nice cuts being used.
The stand out thing
about this place is
probably the owner. She
is one of the loveliest
people I have met during
my foodie escapades. She
quickly learnt who I was
and always struck up con-
versation with me while
I waited for my wrap of
goodness, making sure to
add a little bit extra for me
and my friends.
Jollof Mama has
become a part of not only
my weekly university
schedule but also all my
friends. Once skeptics,
all the friends I put on to
Jollof Mama love it. It’s
gotten to the point that
we nominate someone to
get the order for everyone
else on Fridays. If you’ve
ever had jollof rice, rest
assured that this will cull
any home sickness until
term ends.

to write a caption than a 2

It also helps with contact-
ing resturants for reviews
so follow to help us out.
