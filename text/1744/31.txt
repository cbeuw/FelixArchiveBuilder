tion size which clearly
needs to be slowed
somewhat, and the idea
of crucial asymmetry.
This argument essen-
tially proposes that it is
always more important
to minimise suffering
than to maximise
pleasure.
The philosopher
David Benatar phrased
it like this: The presence
of suffering is ‘bad’, and
the presence of pleasure
is ‘good’. The absence is
suffering is ‘good’, but
the presence of pleasure
is ‘not bad’, in the sense
it’s neither ‘good’ nor
‘bad’. Therefore, it is
always better to not
have children as if you
do, they will experience
‘bad’ and ‘good’, but the
absence of life is not bad
at all, it is either ‘not bad’
or even ‘good’. Another
way to state this is that,
because life brings both
pleasure and suffering,
and suffering is ‘bad’,
but non-existence brings
neither suffering nor
pleasure, it is therefore
preferable.
One main criticism of
this argument is that it is
easy to imagine a life
that has more pleasure
than suffering, and
therefore net pleasure.
However, since the
absence of pleasure
by not being born is
‘not bad’, i.e. a neutral
stance, then any kind
of suffering, no matter
how small, received in
life makes it better to
not have lived at all.
Regardless of whether
this convinces you, it’s
hard to ignore all the
suffering that does go
on in the world, whether
it be disease epidemics,
natural disasters, mass
genocides, war, hunger
and starvation… you
get the idea. More
people will also accel-
erate global warming
which will inevitably
lead to mass ecosystem
collapse, mass migra-
tions and undoubtedly
more conflicts. This
argument would cer-
tainly appeal to the
environmentalist, as it’s
hard to see why adding
to the population could
be a good thing. Benatar
goes further to say that
any suffering that your
offspring receive is
completely your fault,
and it’s your fault if your
offspring then go on to
have more offspring, for
not keeping it in your
pants.
What can we do about
it? What’s important
to get across is that
antinatalism does not
lead to nihilism and the
idea that we might as
well kill everything and
everyone, as obviously
that would cause a large
amount of suffering.
Instead we need to
reduce the number of
humans and sentient
non-human animals
from being born in the
first place. In humans
this is easy, by either
abstaining from sexual
relations or by using ap-
propriate contraception.
In animals it is clearly
not that easy, as we
can’t go around handing
condoms to deer or
squirrels, but there are
things that can be done.
One example is to reduce
the suffering of wild
animals via diseases,
some countries have
immunised foxes (ob-
viously this was likely
done for the benefit of
humans, but still helped
the foxes nonetheless).
Another example is
the mass sterilisation
of mosquitos achieved
by work at Imperial to
combat the spread of
human diseases.
These approaches
clearly aren’t impossi-
ble, but right now this
simply needs to be a
topic of conversation,
just like veganism does,
to spread the word and
so people can think
about it so we can build
the foundations for it
now, for the future. One
obvious thing we can
do as individuals is to
only ever obtain pets
from shelters, not from
breeders as this does
not increase demand for
the birth of more pets.
Furthermore, we can
apply this to humans,
so we should only ever
adopt a child instead of
having our own. I see
absolutely no reason
why people should have
their own children when
there are plenty already
born waiting for a new
parent…
One particularly
interesting objection to
“What’s
important
to get across
is that
antinatalism
does not lead
to nihilism”
this theory came to me
after one of my recent
lectures by Professor
Leroi. We were studying
the genetic health of
humans, and one of the
points made was the
possible decline of intel-
ligence in humans in the
future. The idea is based
on evidence that poorly
educated, low IQ, high
BMI and short people
are more likely to have
kids than well educated,
high IQ tall and low BMI
people. This logically
will lead to a steady
decline of IQ in humans,
and a study conducted
by Kong et al. in 2017
on a population of 500k
people in Iceland con-
cluded that this would
lead to a drop of 0.3
IQ score every gener-
ation. This decline is
currently being masked
by the Flynn effect,
likely caused by the
secularisation of society
and in general the IQ
score is being raised by
2 points per generation
as more people have
the opportunity to go
on to further and higher
education (IQ is always
normalised in surveys
so 100 is the mean,
and when people take
older tests, the mean
rises well over 100).
However, this effect will
likely plateau eventu-
ally, so IQ decline may
be real in the future. So,
if people do start sub-
scribing to antinatalism,
it is likely that the more
intelligent in the popu-
lation would adhere to
it, which would further
accentuate the trend we
already see which is
“It seems
to me that
antinatalism
is just a logical
progression
from
veganism”
often attributed to more
intelligent people focus-
sing more time on edu-
cation and careers rather
than having children,
and therefore even
accelerate a decline of
IQ in future human pop-
ulations. This argument
could also be seen as an
opposition to adoption if
you know that you and
your partner are very
intelligent, however the
impact of ones genetics
as opposed to environ-

mental factors is not
known, and genetics
could in fact play a
miniscule role in deter-
mining how intelligent
your offspring would be.
In conclusion, it seems
to me that antinatalism
is just a logical progres-
sion from veganism, and
indeed vegans already
subscribe to the idea
that it’s bad to bring new
farm animals into exist-
ence, and it’s certainly
something everyone
too should think about,
whether you’re a vegan,
an environmentalist or
neither, as it offers a
vastly different view
than what we’ve been
exposed to before. This
statement paraphrased
from Sam Harris in an
interview with him and
David Benatar is certain-
ly worth a ponder: Anti-
natalism basically leads
to the idea that having
children is essentially
an act of negligence
and ignorance, and
that having children is
simply an irresponsible
act consigning people to
the fate of existing.
