Hyde Park Relays: Runners Get Horny in Hyde Park

O
n Saturday 8th
February, the
much antici-
pated annual
edition of the Hyde Park
Relays race, hosted by
Imperial College Cross-
Country and Athletics
arrived with vigour. With
over 80 teams and hun-
dreds of participants, it
was a roaring success for
the club.
With the first edition
dating back to 1949, this
event holds a special
place in Imperial runners’
hearts, tying students to
Imperial long after they
graduate with the heritage
of the event. As January
came to a close and the
final details had been
arranged, hopes were high
for this historic event.
After an intense week of
preparation, Metric deco-
ration, race-pack making
and coordination with
all attendees, the big day
drew near at a frightening
pace.
The weather forecast
however was bleak. With
the memory of 2018’s
cancellation still fresh
in the club’s memory,
Storm Ciara threatened
to close the parks due
to high winds. An email
from the Royal Parks two
days before the event was
panic inducing at best,
threatening to cancel the
event again, but luckily
the weather held off just
long enough for the event
to take place in safety.
With a disgustingly
early start for the organ-
isers to set up registration
and bring the food, the
crowds started arriving at
10 am at Metric to sign
their team in.
Soon enough, all teams
had registered and made
their way to the Band-
stand in Hyde Park where
the race would soon start.
The weather was glorious.
The wind was down,
the sun was shining, it
was more than we could
ever have hoped for. The
organisers Matt Ryan and
Jim Warren stood in front
of the crowd to deliver
the race brief; you could
feel the tension in the
air, hundreds of runners
ready to give their all to
represent their clubs, their
university (and for some
international teams, even
their country) in such a
historic race. As the clock
struck 1300, the iconic
HPR Horn was sounded
as per tradition, to mark
the start of the race and
the first runners of all
80 plus teams stormed
off along the funnel of
beating his PB by 26
seconds, followed closely
by old rivals Cambridge,
and Hyde Park Relays
newcomers, University of
Bath.
These three would
continue to fight over
podium positions through-
out the race, with the
order changing every lap,
much to the entertainment
and dismay of spectators,
as Imperial blue and red
would be replaced by
Cambridge teal, and then
Bath’s blue and yellow.
Bath again were domi-
nating the mixed race too,
with their mixed team
holding fourth overall
for a leg just behind the
top men’s teams before
being overtaken by Im-
perial’s mighty B-Team
- “Running on Pure Hate”.
In the women’s race,
London University and
CollegesAthletics leaders,
Imperial Women’s A were
again asserting their
dominance over the other
teams, with a 2 minute
lead on Cambridge by the
final lap.
In the end, Imperial
came out on top in both
the mens and womens
races. Men’s A team
(Aptly named “St Mary’s
Go Home Devastated” as
a reflection of the current
LUCA standings) consist-
ing of Henry Hart, Mihaly
Ormay, Thomas Bayley,
Joe Pomfret and Niki
Faulker all running times
of around 16 minute mark
orlower.AndtheWomen’s
achievements, whether
that was Imperial’s re-
sounding wins all round
or Portsmouth’s effort on
the costume competition
winning them some desir-
able retro HPR merch.
After the much needed
showers and a quick
dinner, the Imperial crew
headed to Metric for final
decoration installments
and some early pints,
with the afterparty ready
to start at 8pm. Featuring
ICXCAC,ICTri,BUOTC,
and Portsmouth’s finest
party-animals, consump-
tion of copious amounts
of alcohol from the HPR
Horn by the organisers
and ICXCAC’s favourite
DJs, Niall Woodward and
Dema Ushchapovskyy,
who were absolutely
fantastic - the night was a
huge success! (From the
small part the organisers
can remember of it).
Overall, the day was
a great success from all
points of view; the organ-
isers would like to extend
an absolutely yuuuuge
thank you to everyone
from ICXCAC who
helped throughout the day,
and another big thanks to
all the runners who turned
up to compete, and make
the event happen.

“Imperial were
first in both
womens and
mens races”
cheering spectators,
runners and passers-by.
With the course now
officially measured as 5k,
many runners were eager
to set personal best times
in this spectacular venue,
and boy did they.
As the first runners
made it to the end of their
leg, Henry Hart from
Imperial Men’s A team,
and ICXCAC Captain
was leading the race with
a monumental effort that
would earn him the fastest
leg of the day in 15:23,
“ICXCAC
Captain, Henry
Hart, had the
fastest leg of
the day with 15
minutes and
23 seconds”
A team, consisting of Inga
Van Den Bossche, Laura
Wright, Alex Mundell
and Alix Vermeulen again
smashing some excellent
times to take the win.
Cambridge took home
second in both categories
this year, and first-timers
Bath taking home third
place in the men’s.
Once all the runners
had crossed the finish line,
the masses headed back
to Metric for prizes and
sandwiches (the ones that
Morrisons had actually
remembered to deliver).
Prize-giving was a great
experience, with clubs
from all over the country
celebrating each other’s
