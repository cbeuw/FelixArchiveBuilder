Mother (2009)
T
en years before
the release of
his award-win-
ning Parasite,
Bong Joon-ho filmed
Mother – an even darker,
but equally gripping and
genre defying drama.
Telling a story of a widow
who tries to clear her son
of murder accusations, it
is a mix of crime thriller,
psychological study and
dark comedy.
What makes the story
stand out is how character
driven it is; even better, it
features one of the strong-
est and most determined
leading female characters
I recall ever seeing on
screen. Caring and willing
to do anything to defend
her son, she is, to some
extent, an archetype of a
mother. But while uncon-
ditional motherly love is
usually associated with
everything good and pure,
here it becomes the reason
the character study of the
main suspect’s mother.
Desperate times call for
desperate measures and
the woman turns detec-
tive, quickly becoming
more efficient than local
police in finding missing
pieces of the puzzle. The
film shows how resource-
ful and unstoppable she
is compared to her local
community and what kind
of influence she has on
her moody, childish son.
Kim Hye-ja gives a very
convincing performance
and shows all sides of
mother’s personality,
switching between vul-
nerable and intimidating,
sweet and downright
furious.
Mother does not have a
name; we don’t know her
backstory or motivation
other than just raw instinct
to protect her child. This
makes her seem less like a
real person and more like
a driving force, restlessly
pursuing her goal. Cine-
matography stresses this
point, with mother often
being the only person in
sight, walking through the
fields, marching against
the rain or continuing her
investigation in the middle
of the night. Apart from
great writing, Mother
boasts some very aestheti-
cally pleasing shots.
While I feel that the
Oscars lost their im-
portance, I’m glad that
Parasite’s triumph pushed
me to explore Bong
Joon-ho’s filmography.
Mother is definitely not to
be missed if you are into
crime stories, or just want
to be reminded what kind
of phones everyone had
back in 2009.
