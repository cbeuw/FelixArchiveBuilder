MASTERMIND
Special thanks goes to DoC’s Duncan White, who has very kindly developed the
code to generate Mastermind puzzles like these, along with their relevant graph-
ics for us to use!
Try to guess a secret code of colours in a specific order.
A black peg indicates a correct colour in the correct position. Of course, you are
not told with position(s) contain the correct colour, simply how many positions
contain the correct colour.
A white peg indicates a misplaced colour - the correct colour but in a different
position! A few guesses have already been given, leadinng to a unique solution!
There are easier variations with more examples at:
https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dcw/Mastermind.pdf
The 4-hole puzzle involves the colours RGBY (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).
The 5-hole puzzle involves the colours BPG (Blue, Pink, Green).
We’ve solved an example to help you out!
In this example, the first guess involves 3 out of the 4 colours, Red, Blue, and
Green. This guess scores zero pegs, and this would force the solution to the
the only remaining colour; Yellow. Hence, the solution has to be YYYY!
CRYPTOGRAM
The letters of the alphabet have been scrambled and numbered
0 to 25. A quote has been hidden for you to decode, and a grid
has been provided to help you out.
