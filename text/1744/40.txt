CGCU Wellbeing Chair
member rallied strongly
against “performative”
allies, those who claim to
support LGBT inclusion
but continuing to say and
do things that contain
grains of unexamined
homophobia.
This led onto discus-
sion on the space between
microaggressions and
outright homophobia.
Many panel members
agreed that disparaging or
alienating comments and
actions should be vocally
addressed by members/
allies of the community,
and letting these com-
ments slide is paramount
to permission for them to
be repeated. In the case
of microaggressions, one
key recommendation was
to create spaces for dis-
course and understanding
on why their repeated
occurrence can create so
much discomfort for those
affected.
Sometimes, it’s not
even about outright
homophobic behaviour
and hostile work envi-
ronments, but instead the
individual’s innate con-
cerns about whether being
completely open about
their sexuality will hinder
their career advancement.
And again, this is a place
where allies can help, nor-
malising, and embracing
cognitive diversity – the
idea that teams are more
effective because they’re
diverse in their thinking,
perspectives, and infor-
mation processing style.
Joël McConnell, Exec-
utive Director of Mar-
keting, Recruitment and
Admissions at Imperial
College Business School,
and Co-Chair of Imperial
600, also noted the im-
portance of positive role
modelling and how insti-
tutional support for LGBT
professional networks can
help staff feel more com-
fortable to ‘bring their
whole selves to work’ –
creating an environment
where staff don’t feel they
have to conceal part of
their identity to advance
professionally.
Professional LGBT-fo-
cused industry networks
like InterEngineering,
whose Co-Chair Dominic
Cronin spoke on the
panel, are also an essen-
tial resource for students
entering the workplace.
Offering insider knowl-
edge on which workplaces
are truly LGBT friendly,
providing an added check
beyond the content of
what companies typi-
cally include on their
diversity page. The term
“Corporate Pinkwashing”
was explored from a
consumer perspective,
and some panellists were
of the opinion that without
meaningful action, taking
up space at pride and
slapping rainbow ﬂags
on logos is borderline
exploitative. Further,
the commodification of
the LGBT community
can perpetuate LGBT
stereotypes, and encour-
age performativity over
authenticity, inclusivity
and consultant Daniel
Nasr felt his sexuality
was at times defined by
“how many ‘Yas Queen’s
[he] said when at work”.
Responsible corporate
attitudes towards LGBT
issues were therefore con-
sidered to be a major area
for improvement.
An emphasis on
intersectional diversity
underscored the discus-
sion, with the panel being
inadvertently all-male
and majority white, it
was acknowledged that
organizations must work
to tackle diversity and
inclusion in a more com-
prehensive way. Intersec-
tional issues can easily
be underappreciated in
discussions about specific
minority groups, therefore
conversations between
minority groups, intersec-
tional representation, and
a less binary approach to
the inclusion of minorities
within companies is a key
next step in building a
more diverse society.
The experiences and
insights of our panellists
expanded my understand-
ing of the issues faced
around diversity and in-
clusion in the workplace.
Upon reﬂection after
the event, I wondered if
attitudes towards gender,
and particularly mascu-
linity underscored many
of these issues, which a
less rigid attitude towards
what it means to be a man
or woman might ease.
And indeed, one of the
most important topics in
corporate diversity circles
right now is getting trans
inclusion policy right, so
keep an eye out for devel-
opments on this topic in
the year ahead.
Many thanks to all those
who attended or helped
to organise the evening.

O
n Monday the
10th of Feb-
ruary, the City
& Guilds Col-
lege Union (CGCU) had
the pleasure of hosting
a panel of LGBT advo-
cates in a discussion on
LGBT inclusion in the
workplace. While my
sense is that Imperial
College London is gen-
erally inclusive, I found
there to be plenty of
nuanced moments and
learning opportunities
during the discussion,
which I wanted to share
with readers.
In order to create a
workplace that fully inte-
grates LGBT profession-
als, straight LGBT equal-
ity supporters (commonly
referred to as ‘allies’) are
essential. While much
positive change has been
made in the workplace,
these allies play a key
role in ensuring members
of the LGBT community
are heard, and concerns
are addressed if more
subtle, entrenched pieces
of homophobia are to be
tackled. Vaneet Mehta, a
