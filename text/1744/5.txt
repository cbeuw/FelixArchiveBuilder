T
he College is
putting on a hu-
manities-based
e x h i b i t i o n
between the 2nd and 6th
of March, celebrating
the presence of human-
ities and the arts at the
College. The exhibition
takes place 70 years on
from the ‘Touchstone’
weekends that began
place at Silwood campus
in 1950, which featured
discussions on ethics, phi-
losophy, art and design,
and psychology.
The exhibition will
feature events such as
talks on the future of
music, concerts in col-
laboration with the Blyth
Centre, and a visit to
Silwood campus to get
back in touch with the
Touchstone origins.
It will also feature
a project generated by
the StudentShapers pro-
gramme, as part of the
Horizons Change Makers
independent project.
The projects created by
students will be on display,
and will focus on human
sustainable development
or environmental issues.
The exhibition was
instigated by the Director
of the Centre for Culture,
Languages, and Com-
munication, Dr. Roberto
Trotta, a theoretical
cosmologist at Imperial.
The CCLC is the hub of
the Horizons programme,
which enables students to
take courses in non-STEM
subjects in topics as wide
as creative writing or
psychology.
On why he was inspired
to create the exhibition,
Dr. Trotta said:
“Humanities are vital
for students; it puts their
discipline into the broader
societal context of the
world around them today.
It develops critical and
creative thinking, as well
as communication skills
and the ability to deal with
a broad range of situations
which don’t always have
‘black and white’, ‘right
or wrong’ answers like
STEM. Surveys we’ve
run with alumni have
overwhelmingly shown to
be highly valued skills in
the workplace. Students
here don’t always see that
– they’re very focused
on succeeding on their
degree – but it will help
them succeed!”
Horizons can directly
trace its origins back to
the Touchstone weekends,
which led over decades
into the ‘Associated
Studies Department’ and
the Department for Social
and Economic Studies
and then the Humanities
Department, before incor-
porating language courses
and finally becoming
Horizons. The Science
Communication Group,
which hosts the only
non-STEM or Business
course at Imperial (the
MSc in Science Commu-
nication), was introduced
in the 1990s.
The next step will be
the I-Explore modules
being introduced to the
College. These will make
it compulsory for students
to take alternative courses
outside of their specific
degrees, which will
count for credit – rather
than it being optional
in Horizons and only
counting towards degrees
on a department-by-de-
partment basis.
Dr. Trotta said of the
exhibition: “We wanted to
use the 70th anniversary
to look back at our past,
but also as a springboard
for our future. Bringing
purely humanities
courses, which are under
pressure across the
country, to a STEM uni-
versity like Imperial, and
having College leadership
recognise the value it
brings, is very reassuring
that we can have the best Dr. Roberto Trotta // Thomas Angus
S
imone Buitendijk,
Imperial College’s
Vice Provost
(Education), will
be departing the College
and beginning a new
role at the head of Leeds
University for the next ac-
ademic year. Her new role
begins on 1st September
2020.
The transfer comes
shortly after the beginning
of the College’s Learning
and Teaching Strategy
(LTS), which was led
and directed by Professor
Buitendijk. The LTS will
shape how education at
the College evolves over
the next several years,
and has already delivered
funding for projects such
as ‘active learning’lecture
theatres in Blackett and
the innovative ‘Chemical
Kitchen’ course in Chem-
istry.
Her appointment was
approved by Leeds’
Council, their governing
body, after a unanimous
recommendation by
a panel consisting of
various Council and
Senate members from the
university.
David Gray, who heads
the panel, said in a Leeds
University statement:
“"She has a clear vision
for how research and
education should work
in tandem in a global
university with strong
civic roots; an impressive
record of institutional
change management; and
an exemplary grasp of the
moral purpose of higher
education, particularly in
relation to diversity, par-
ticipation and inclusion.”
Other than the LTS,
Professor Buitendijk
garnered controversy
during her time at Imperial
over comments and shared
posts on Twitter, which
students felt represented
transphobic views. The
account was eventually
deleted and an apology
was issued by Professor
Buitendijk.
Imperial’s Provost, Ian
Walmsley, said:
“Simone has made a
profound contribution
to Imperial’s education,
community, and student
experience. She has led
a transformation of our
learning and teaching,
developing a strategy
with students at its heart.
This is a fitting and well
deserved appointment and
we wish her all the best at
Leeds.”
Interview with Simone
to follow next week.
