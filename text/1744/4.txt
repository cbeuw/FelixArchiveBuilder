S
everal Imperial
r e s e a r c h e r s
based at the
J-IDEA and
MRC Centre for Global
Infectious Disease Anal-
ysis in White City – a
world-leading institute
– have been using data
science to track and
calculate transmission
and fatality rates for the
coronavirus outbreak
currently spreading
internationally.
The head of the J-IDEA
institute, Neil Ferguson,
additionally ran a pres-
entation and Q+A session
with the World Economic
Forum, detailing their
findings thus far.
Thus far, the data track-
ing shows that the fatality
rate is approximately
1%, with a transmission
ratio of between 2 and
3 – making the virus more
transmissible than pan-
demic influenza viruses.
Professor Ferguson
further detailed some of
the issues with obtaining
reliable data. Reported
cases in China are typical-
ly only the most severe,
often only once pneumo-
nia has developed, while
internationally more mild
cases – which are the
vast majority – are being
tracked. Furthermore,
China’s strict control
measures targeted multi-
ple causes of transmission
– for example, banning
people from attending
work or school, whilst
also banning travel, and
so on. It is then hard to
identify what measure
was actually effective.
Additionally, the
virus can incubate for
weeks between infection
and the development of
symptoms. This can make
determining number of in-
fections and transmissiv-
ity challenging, with one
example given of a patient
who died in France likely
having been infected a
month beforehand.
This has led to drastic
revisions of initial esti-
mates for the total number
of cases – from an estimate
of 4000 on 18th January to
107,000 on 3rd February.
During the presentation,
Professor Ferguson said
that it is likely that the
outbreak has caused up to
ten times more infections
than have been detected
and reported.
It also appears that
the virus is significantly
more deadly to the elderly
– however, while respira-
tory illnesses are also
often a danger to children,
bans on attending school
in China have limited the
number of young cases.
A tentative estimate on
the fatality rate for those
who have already reached
the stage of pneumonia is
18%.
There is a concern that
should the virus break
out in pandemic-scale in
other countries, it could
put severe stress on
healthcare systems; but
with forewarning, this is
already being planned for
as a contingency.
Simultaneously, a team
of academics based in St.
Mary’s, in the Department
of Infectious Disease,
have been part of a global
race to develop a vaccine,
led by Robin Shattock.
Professor Shattock
spoke to Ryan O’Hare in
an Imperial podcast. He
outlined the differences
between this coronavirus
and a previous one called
SARS – namely that
SARS, while more fatal,
was not transmissible
until symptoms showed,
meaning that effectively
quarantining patients was
significantly easier and
more effective. Physical
controls are thus less
useful, hence its rapid
spread.
However, a core differ-
ence between the SARS
outbreak and this one is
the rapidity with which it
has been reported, and the
advancement of technol-
ogy since. With accurate
gene sequencing available
quickly, it took just weeks
to get a novel RNA-based
vaccine attempt going in
the lab. This is by contrast
to a typical progression,
with five years in the dis-
covery phase and a further
two to manufacture and
do clinical trials.
The vaccine developed
by Professor Shattock
and his team has already
entered animal testing –
with the possibility for
human trials to begin
as early as summer.
However, he warns that
a full vaccine will not
be widely available until
next year, at the absolute
earliest. In the meantime,
antivirals are being used
in China to try to combat
badly affected patients,
which may provide a
stopgap solution.

Group has completed
its consultation period
and reported back to
the College Council on
February 14th.
The College Council
has reportedly accepted
the suggestions of the
report with only minor
amendments, which are
being finalised now and
will be made public on
March 2nd – alongside
an amended policy for
investment. More spe-
cifically, the Terms of
Reference for the Endow-
ment Board – who control
the College’s investment
assets – will be changed
to reflect the new policy.
For this reason, the
policy was initially
proposed to the En-
dowment Board on 3rd
February, before it went
to College Council.
The SRI Working
Group was initially set up
in response to a paper pre-
sented to College Council
in November by the
Union President, Abhijay
Sood, Deputy President
(Finance and Services,
Fifi Henry, and Ethics
and Environment Officer,
Francesca Siracusa.
The paper called for an
assessment of Imperial’s
investment habits. This
followed from the reveal
in 2018 that the College
had heavy investment in
fossil fuel companies, as
well as other fields with
questionable ethics such
as the arms industry or
pharmaceuticals.
The Group then spent
thesubsequenttwomonths
generating feedback from
the College community as
well as external experts
from both sides of the
debate, including offering
the chance for open
submissions for consider-
ation.
Felix will follow up
with a report on the Policy
when it is revealed on
March 2nd.
