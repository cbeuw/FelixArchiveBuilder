ince Exposed
seems to be the
favourite place to
talk about Revel, I
thought I would adopt an
Exposed like structure to
the CU section this week.

[Year 1 RCSU]
What even is this Rev-
el thing everyone’s on
about?
“Revel is an annual black
tie event hosted by the
RCSU and DoCSoc each
year. This year “Roaring
Revel” will be hosted at
Quaglinos, a very fancy
venue in St James’ Park,
on March 2nd.”

[Year 3 RCSU]
Is Revel really worth £35
for a night out??
“Whilst tickets might
seem expensive at £35
let me take you through
venue, the DJ, photogra-
pher and other fees, the
total value of each ticket
is just over £70. So tick-
ets at £35 are an absolute
steal!”
#rcsue003
[Year 2 RCSU]
What’s so special about
Revel anyway?
“An amazing DJ, one hell
of a venue, great food and
drinks. What more could
you want?
For the first time in Revel
History, we’re pleased to
bring you one of the best
DJs in London! We are so
pleased to announce An-
tics, former DJ of KOKO
as our DJ for Roaring
Revel!
Revel is all about giving
students a fancy black
tie event they would
not otherwise be able to
experience without the
support from the RCSU
and DoCSoc.”

“In the words of DoC-
Soc’s Anindita Ghosh,
“ICE is now a cesspool of
confessions, complaints
and cat pictures” Please
don’t get me wrong, I
hold nothing against cats
or secret confessions, but
having been at the receiv-
ing end of critical ex-
posed posts, I just wanted
to mention how they
really don’t help anyone
at all. I will always be
the first person to vouch
for constructive criticism
helping a society grow. I
will admit MathSoc prob-
ably surveys its members
wayyy too much, but
that’s just because we
value our members ideas
and needs, and we want
to deliver events that our
members actually want to
come to.
However, bashing a
society with baseless
remarks on Exposed is

exactly what each ticket
includes:
• 1 cocktail £12.50
(mockatail £11)
• 3 x Beer/Wine 3 x £6.40
• 1 Spirit + Mixer £9.25
• 4 Canapés £15
As a highly proficient
maths student (not), we
can calculate that the
total food and drink value
of the ticket is just under
£50. Now we have a
12.5% service charge on
top of this, taking us to
£56. Including the extra
charges for preparing the

“hosted at
Quaglinos,
a very fancy
venue in St
James’Park, on
March 2nd”
week MathSoc faced
criticism around the num-
ber of events we’ve run.
For context, we’ve run/
co-hosted 34 events al-
ready this year, that aver-
ages out to 1.9 events per
week! Having run only
half this number of events
last year we are certainly
‘‘baseless
remarks on
Exposed
is helping
absolutely no
one”
growing, leaving the post
with having no substance
whatsoever, which is just
not constructive. So in
the process of trying to
bring us down, all you’ve
done is make yourself
look clueless and not
changed the society in
anyway at all.
If you actually want to
help a society get better
do one of these things:
a) Speak to the commit-
“all you’ve
done is make
yourself look
clueless and
not changed
the society in
any way at all”
tee, let them know what
events you want to see
b) Volunteer to help
organise the events you
want to see
c) Even better, run for a
position on that commit-
tee to help change things
for the better next year!
Volunteers sacrifice a
hell of a lot of their time
(and degree), working
incredibly hard to make
YOUR university expe-
rience better! Please try
to appreciate us, because,
believe me, we just want
to make sure you have a
great time at our events.”
So in short:
1. Revel should be pretty
great this year
2. Give some love to the
volunteers working so
hard to give you the best
events
3. Stand for a committee
position now to help be
the change you want to
