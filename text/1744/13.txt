Leopoldstadt
I, Cinna
I
t’s Christmas 1899
in Vienna, and with
their families togeth-
er for the season,
idly bantering over Der
Judenstaat,HermannMerz
and Ludwig Jakobvicz
glibly run through all
the corners of the world
where Zionism might find
its home: Palestine? Not
whilst the Ottomans hold
the Levant. The Ugandan
Highlands? Lion-infested.
How about a Jewish
colony in Madagascar?
The laughter that follows
is undercut by horror:
the Nazi bureaucracy
would toy with the idea
of deporting the entirety
of European Jewry to the
island, before Auschwitz
and Treblinka.
Uneasy hindsight runs
through the whole of
Stoppard’s Leopoldstadt.
Hermann (Adrian Scar-
borough), an affluent
Austrian “of Jewish
descent”, articulates a
faith in progress and mo-
dernity straight out of the
Enlightenment: his grand-
father was chased out
of Russia by a pogrom;
his father ran a clothes
factory; and Hermann
rubs shoulders with the
Prince ofAustro-Hungary.
Of course, the mayor of
Vienna is an anti-Semite,
but what‘s that compared
to the massacres of the
past? They are a gener-
ation away from being
considered Austrian,
Hermann argues.
Ludwig (Ed Stoppard)
disagrees. They are
Jewish, and in the eyes of
gentiles that mark is in-
erasable. The aristocracy
might tolerate Hermann
for his money, he warns,
but that doesn’t mean he’s
assimilated: to be accepted
doesn’t mean hiding his
Jewishness, but being
able to carry on as a Jew
“without insult”. Ludwig
doesn’t hold much hope
in that happening. The
past is on his side. So is
the future.
​
And so we follow the
Merzes and Jakoboviczes
through the voids ripped
through the fabric of
Europe: to 1924, Her-
mann’s son now armless
and mad from the war, fas-
cism’s shadow crawling
over the continent; to
1938, their families
huddled in a single room,
Nazis marching on the
streets; and finally to
1955, the family apart-
ment stripped and worn,
and a much smaller
family to match. There are
laughs, and diversions to
the Riemann Hypothesis
(this is a Stoppard play),
but the entire production
gravitates around Jewish-
ness – Jewishness chosen
or imposed, Jewishness
inside Europe or out - and
the appalling negative
space Nazism would leave
in its place.
​
It’s banal to implore re-
memberence, and as time
passes it’s easy to lose the
urgency and horror of the
Shoah – political football
over Polish culpability,
selfies at Auschwitz.
Leopoldstadt is not a
perfect play: no character
bar Hermann rises above
a sketch, and its digres-
sions are perhaps too
unrestrained. Yet I’ve not
had an experience at the
theatre quite like seeing
an audience, chuckling
their way through the
Schoenberg jokes,
brought to silence by one
of the last Jakoboviczes as
she lists the destinations
of her family members.
I’ve never heard the word
Auschwitz repeated so
many times in my life. I
don’t have anything intel-
ligent to add. Go see this.

, Cinna is a tragic
tale of mistaken
identity, set against
the background of
Shakespeare’s Julius
Caesar. For those of
you unfamiliar with one
of Shakespeare’s most
famous “historical” plays,
it portrays the dramatic
events of 44 BC in Rome.
Julius Caesar, recently
declared dictator for life,,
is assassinated by his own
senators for the good of
the Roman Republic. In
the aftermath, an innocent
poet, Cinna, who happens
to share the name with
one of the conspirators,
is brutally beaten to death
by a pro-Caesar mob. I,
Cinna imagines the story
of this side character,
eking out an existence in
the uncertain final days of
the Roman Republic.
I, Cinna forces the
audience to think. Just
as Shakespeare’s Julius
Caesar focuses on the life
and times of the great and
good, so I, Cinna focuses
the mind on the small
and insignificant. Each
member of the audience
was issued with their
own notepad and pencil.
The power of the written
word was writ large in our
laps as Cinna composed a
poem appropriate for the
turbulent times. I came
away from the play with
a great appreciation of
strength.
Tim Crouch, in an
engaging one-man per-
formance, cowers from
the powers that be as
Cinna the uncertain poet.
He convincingly portrays
a man that is watching
everything he holds dear
being destroyed. He
cannot write about life
and love, but only about
war and death.
I’m certain that the
word timely is overused
when discussing modern
productions. We are by no
means living in Cinna’s
world, the violent over-
throw of an old regime by
a cadre of hardened, ambi-
tious politician-generals.
Instead, this production is
a thoughtful examination
of the might of the pen
and the danger of words.
Ideas may not be killable,
but people certainly
are. Cinna the poet was
murdered for the crime of
sharing the wrong name.
After professing his inno-
cence, he was condemned
for his bad verses. Bril-
liantly, this production
shows that in tumultuous
times innocence is no
defense against the mob.
Words have power, and
danger too.

Cinna the character. No

as an example of the
mob’s bloodthirsty hunger
for revenge: instead, a
