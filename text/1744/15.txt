No Playing Around in this Doll’s House
O
riginally per-
formed and set
in late 19th cen-
tury Norway,
Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s
House sparked great out-
rage for its controversially
candid portrait of woman-
hood. Stef Smith’s Nora:
A Doll’s House, adapts
this into three parallel
timelines: 1918, 1968
and 2018, chosen for the
milestones of women’s
suffrage, the legalisation
of abortion and the MeToo
movement. The plot fol-
lows Nora’s crisis when
a secret from her past is
threatened to be revealed
to her husband, Thomas.
In her desperation, she
becomes disillusioned
and dissatisfied with her
life, which eventually
leads to the deterioration
of her seemingly perfect
marriage.
The play opens on the
three Noras entering the
home laden with bags
of Christmas shopping,
chorusing, echoing and
finishing each other’s
sentences as they weave
around each other in
an impeccably choreo-
graphed introduction. The
square, thrust stage at the
Young Vic is perfect for
this living room setting,
easily drawing the
audience into the intimate
domestic scene. The warm
lighting in the ‘haven’
of the family home in
the foreground is in
chilling contrast with the
darkness through the three
doorways behind where,
unseen to the audience,
a cold, bleak river lies.
Nora’s warnings for her
children to be mindful of
the river are juxtaposed
by her own romanticised
notion of the numbness it
would grant her, a motif
for her desire to escape.
Anna Russell-Martin,
Natalie Klamar and
Amaka Okafor do an
excellent job of communi-
cating their Noras’ shared
emotional repression
whilst retaining clear
individual personalities.
However, each actor also
shifts between characters
and time periods to play
Christine (the long-lost
friend) which is somewhat
confusing to keep track of.
The sole husband, Thomas
is played by Poldark’s
heartthrob Doctor, Luke
Norris, who switches mas-
terfully between the roles.
An especially admirable
feat at the climax, where
he and the audience, are
left spinning by the pace
of change.
Smith makes an attempt
to tackle the topic of ho-
mosexuality as well as the
persistence of women’s
suffering, an ambitious
task to do successfully in
a 90 minute play and sadly
only serves to detract from
the significance of both
issues. Though largely
well written, the script
also leaves the message of
the play a little stale, with
some banal lines such as
“sometimes love is not
enough”.
Even though it misses
the mark in places,
Smith’s bold and brave
reimagining of this classic
is a gripping watch. With
its creative role-switching
and thoughtful staging,
Nora: A Doll’s House is
a wonderfully refreshing
change from popular
theatre.
