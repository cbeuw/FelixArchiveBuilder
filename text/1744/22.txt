DJ Shadow, RL Grime
and Aphex Twin already
under his belt G Jones
has nowhere to go but
up. This EP, an ‘epilogue’
to The Ineffable Truth
(Jones’ last LP), is almost
everything one cold hope
for in an electronic record.
Tangential Zones’
breakneck bangers are
built on gritty, glitchy
synths, tightly welded
drum lines and the
silences between.
The arrangement of
each track on Tangential
Zones can make the listen
somewhat disorienting.
Abrupt pauses add
excitement and intrigue
to, traditional builds and
drops of ‘Dark Artifact’.
The fact that sounds here
bear more resemblance
to video game SFX than
instruments (see ‘Dream
Fatigue) adds to the
confusion, the listening
experience analogous to
being lost in a rave.
“Do I want to be lost in
a rave?”, you ask yourself.
If you enjoy high produc-
tion quality, well arranged
dance music, and feeling
slightly overwhelemed, I
would hazard a yes.

F
u Chronicles
is the latest
record from
Afrobeat col-
lective Antibalas, which
has been operating out
of New York for the last
20 years. With colourful
horn and guitar lines and
a tight rhythm section
(tastefully adorned with
percussion of course),
the record is invigorat-
ing and engaging.
Opener ‘Amenawon’
sets the stage gently,
with lyrics translating
to “may the water you
will drink not pass you
by” around a steady
guitar lick, teasing the
listener with a number
of false climaxes before
erupting into a full-on
groove at the 4-minute
mark. Call and response
improvisation between
the horn section and an
organ and flute follows,
a fascinating textural,
rhythmic and harmonic
interplay.
The rest of the record
is made up of similar
grooves, varying in
tempo and instrumental
composition, but main-
taining the same blend
of jazz, funk andAfrican
elements which make
Afrobeat such a potent
genre. The dramatic
horn hits which punctu-
ate sections of ‘MTTT,
Pt. 1 & 2’ as well as
it’s catchy “Tic-toc-tic”
refrain makes it par-
ticularly notable. The
following track ‘Fight
Am Finish’, which
strikes the ear with
its opening synth line
before diverting into a
romping 3 time groove,
is also a fun listen.

N
avy Blue is
perhaps best
known for
his appear-
ance on Earl Sweatshirt’s
Some Rap Songs, where
his understated, monot-
onous style did little to
distinguish him from
his New York based
contemporaries - artists
like MIKE, Medhane and
Standing On The Corner,
whose dusty, minimal
take on rap has garnered
a respectable following in
recent years. I have found
this style to lack any dis-
tinguishably worthwhile
qualities (i.e. interesting
lyrics, production), Àdá
Irin is an exception.
On his debut LP, Navy
Blue shows up his peers
with a strong ear for
samples. The record’s
intrumental pallete is
built on Gospel-esque
choir and horn samples, a
fitting backdrop for Blue’s
often introspective lyrics:
“Razor sharp memories
up in the grooves/On my
brain, life’s riddle is the
truth”.
The record’s lack of
features, (KAs verse on
‘In Good Hands’ non-
withstanding), adds to it’s
intimacy. Navy Blue finds
space to hide references
to past friends, parents,
religion and depression
in his sparse lines. Un-
derstanding Navy Blue’s
poetry is a two way
process, but a worthwhile
one.

Power’s ad-libs draw
on the exclamations
that acompany powerful
punches. The afore-
mentioned ‘Fight Am
Finish’, goes further,
with instrumental breaks
preceded by cries of
“Round one!”, as well
as wrestling referenc-
es, “Are you ready to
rumble?”.
Fu Chronicles will
probably be the best tra-
ditional Afrobeat record
to come out this year.
While it doesn’t break
new ground, Antibalas’
talented musicians pack
Fu Chronicles’ tracks
with abundant energy
and detail, enough to
reward many listens.
50 years on, Fela Kuti’s
legacy is very much
Y
ou lie half-
awake in an
o ff - w h i t e
room; its
voile curtains billow
gently. The sound of
waves ebbing over
basalt steals in. Beams
of watery light float
across the room, tracing
the sun’s path. This is
the world of Blushing,
Florida band Copeland’s
6th album, released
a year ago last week.
Here, the band embraces
modern production to
meld their delicate and
dreamy sound, creating
an ethereal and emotion-
ally potent experience.
Blushing’s lyrics
frame moments with-
in a relationship from
an introverted perspec-
tive, delving into the
intoxicating effect love
can have on ones inner
world, “[The kiss] was
red like wine and bent
your mind the same”
frontman Aaron Marsh
croons on ‘Colourless’.
On tracks like ‘On Your
Worst Day’ and ‘Night
Figures’, the emotional
worlds opened by love
are all consuming to the
point of isolation; lines
like “I wake but lay-
ers of a dream/lay over
everything I see” cap-
ture the visceral reali-
ty feelings of love can
evoke, and cast over
one’s daily life.
Marsh’s imagery
sweetens the record’s
pithy emotions, com-
paring his partners lips
“Some strange flower,
reaching for the sun”,
the sight of them has
him “a river bed, crubm-
ling at [her] feet”.
The approach to pro-
duction on Blushing is
unlike any other record I
have heard. A sparse, im-
pressionistic approach
dominates the record.
Gorgeous sounds, from
breezy strings to skel-
etal synths drop in and
out of tracks at a mo-
ment’s notice. Copeland
craft an intricate, cin-
ematic backdrop to the
record’s enveloping
songwriting. Tracks like
‘Strange Flower’ shift
between sections with
completely different in-
struments with ease, the
band goin as far as to
change the track’s drum
sound 3 times to perfect-
ly fit each section.
Blushing’s poetic
songwriting and meticu-
lous, elegant production
are a unique experience,
that make it an essential
listen for any fans of
dream pop and indie.
