Lacrosse team survive lack of half time
oranges and salvage eight all draw
Imperial Women’s 1st 8
UCL Women’s 1st 8
By Michelle Maloney
The team’s prayers were
answered when, with min-
utes to spare, the Shropshire
massive arrived and we got a
goalie. Thank you Emma, we
are forever in your debt.
The first match in a new
league did not get off to an
inspired start. Weather
down south in Teddington:
“light drizzle”. UCL scored
within a couple of minutes
and Imperial seemed to
have problems getting going.
However the sight of the ‘the
Godmother’ arriving on the
touchline provided motiva-
tion, and we began to see
some nice lacrosse. Caroline
scored a stunner to bring us
level. But despite some excel-
lent defending, the quarter
finished 3-1 to UCL.
After regrouping, reshuf-
fling and bringing the
Godmother on, the second
quarter finished 4-4. Mary
‘the tiger’ Matthews, captain
of vice Lizzie and new girl
Sam ‘the terrier’ all put them-
selves on the score sheet.
Despite the lack of half-
time oranges (sack the cap-
tain), the second half started
well. UCL had also raised
their game and it was now
a very closely fought match.
We were one down or level
until the dying minutes of the
last quarter, when Hannah
took us into the lead. You see.
Madam. Unfortunately, in the
last few seconds, UCL pulled
one back and it was all over
at eight all, a fair score for an
excellent match.
Mary was man of the match
because she is awesome
and played like a woman
possessed. Special mention
to the freshers who braved
the buses: Lizzie V, Sam and
Frank.

Results
Kent Men’s 1st 112
Imperial Men’s 1st 132
The team made a good start
to the season by missing their
train. But they didn’t let that
get them down. No, I have
to credit the team with great
resolve in being able to over-
come the unexpected punctu-
ality of British public trans-
port. So after a gentle jog all
the way to Canterbury, while
finding the time for a lengthy
stop at England’s largest sec-
ond hand bookshop, arriving
just 15 minutes late wasn’t
such a bad result.
The team entered the
hall with presence – every-
one turning to look, possibly
because of good looks, per-
haps because of reputations,
or maybe just because Pierre
was foaming at the mouth,
who knows. The fact of the
matter was that Imperial
were there to get down to
business.
First match. Foil. Imperial’s
weakest weapon. Rory first on
the piste. Bang! Bang! Bang!
He puts the bitch down. Up
comes Hugo. Pure class. Kent
doesn’t know what’s hit them.
Finally, the Big Man: Eric Lai
was solid as a rock, with a very
good performance against a
talented fencer. The rest of
the match didn’t go quite as
well and Imperial lost 45-42.
It was close enough, with the
big guns still to come.
Now for the sabre. Easy
win for the team. Pierre did
Imperial proud despite “not
feelingit”.Ididn’taskwhat“it”
was mainly because I know
what that boy’s like. Rory
made his second appearance,
stunning the crowd with his
almost Jedi-like skills. Eric
showed himself more than
capable of holding his own
with his weakest weapon. 45-
30. Nice.
Now Imperial had the lead
in their grasp, with just the
epée to go. There were con-
crete performances from
Hugo and Matt, with Eric
really coming into his own.
An effective set of fights took
the score to 45-37, making
a grand total of 132-112 in
favour of Imperial. First win
of the season. Sure not to be
the last. Well done team, keep
up the good work.
Onaslightlymoreimportant
note, the girl Pierre seemed
to find quite attractive appar-
ently thought someone else
to be considerably better than
him. Damn that handsome
devil...

Late start, winning finish

Mulleted striker’s offside goal
denies Fourths victory
Imperial Men’s 4th 2
RVC Men’s 1st 2
By Michael Nicholson
Imperial Fourths started off
the season against an expe-
rienced RVC side, who had
just achieved two consecu-
tive promotions.
An early blow was dealt
when striker Jai was ruled
out during the extended
warm-up, which was caused
by a flat tyre on one of the
RVC vehicles.
Despitetheprolongedwarm
up, it was RVC who started
the match stronger, with
Imperial looking like a team
who hadn’t played together
very much (funny that), and
the vets were unlucky when
their mulleted striker, who
must be about 104 by now, got
to a cross ahead of captain
Vanni and crashed a header
against the bar.
It came as something of
a surprise when Imperial
took the lead against
the run of play. The move
started when Tim (to borrow
a phrase from Thirds cap-
tain Shatters) “beefed” one
of their midfielders with a
tremendous tackle and the
ball broke to Paul in mid-
field, who threaded a quality
ball through to Shwin.
Shwin held the ball up before
playing in Demetris, who
remained calm and curled
a beauty of a finish around
the ‘keeper and into the cor-
ner! Get in! Subsequently,
the Fourths woke up, started
playing and coasted into
half time with the lead
safely intact.
The second half started
abysmally when some idiot
got nutmegged by the Mullet,
leaving him a clear run to the
by line. He crossed well to his
unmulleted strike partner,
who had an easy tap-in.
Imperial showed incred-
ible fighting spirit to bounce
back and retake the lead with
Shwin’s first goal for the club.
He received the ball in the box
after a neat one-two on the
left between Ed and Chris,
turned well and smacked it
in. Another beauty!
And that should have
been that, with the Imperial
defence holding firm and
the vets’ attacks becom-
ing increasingly panicked.
Then one of RVC’s brutes at
the back punted the ball
up the park in the vague
direction of the Mullet
who was about half a mile
offside. Vanni, expecting the
imminent whistle, let the
ball run. The Mullet sensed
an opening and nipped in to
nod the ball into the empty
net. Imperial couldn’t really
give a shit, and placed the
ball ready for the free kick.
However, the referee whis-
tled for the first time in
the match and gave a goal.
Unbelievable.
The game petered out into
a tame draw, when a morale
boosting victory for the
mighty Fourths would have
been the least they deserved.
Still, quality performances
from everyone mean that
the team look a good bet for
promotion. The reward for
the vets is a place alongside
Holloway on the list of teams
we hate.
