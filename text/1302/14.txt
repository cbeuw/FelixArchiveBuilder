My London felix@ic.ac.uk
My... clubs
Fabric is probably the best club in London right now
[see Nightlife, page 16]. Quality DJs every week, a
unique venue, a sensible door policy (you can wear
trainers on a Friday), reasonably priced drinks and a
kick ass soundsystem make this my number one club!
Turnmills and The End are also pretty cool if you
like your dance music. Ministry is usually full of tour-
ists but they do have some good house nights on
Saturdays. However if you want more of a cheesy club-
bing experience then my faves are School Disco at the
Hammersmith Palais and Carwash at the Aquarium in
Old Street. Personally I have had several very funny
nights in both places! Yes, dressing up can be a pain,
but it’s more fun if you make the effort. Aquarium is
particularly cool as it actually has a swimming pool in
the club!
Alternatively check out Strawberry Moons off Regent
street. Whatever you do, for Gods’s sake avoid Leicester
Square!”
My... pubs
“My fave bars in London have to be The Social, an excel-
lent DJ bar just off Oxford Street; Nordic on Goodge
Street, which is a random Scandinavian bar that does
lots of different shooters and cocktails in a nice relaxed
atmosphere; Walkabout in Shepherds Bush for watching
sport and generally drinking cheaply; and the Alphabet
Bar in Soho which has quality house music at the week-
end and isn’t too pricey.”
My... restaurants
“I guess my favourite places to go would be Wagamama’s
[there’s a branch on Kensington High Street, close
to the main Imperial campus] or the very similar but
slightly better Satsuma on Wardour Street. Other great
Japanese places are Misato and Tokyo Diner (Leicester
square) and Ichizen (Goodge Street).”
My... work
“I’m still studying here at Imperial, having just started
my final year of my PhD. I did my undergrad here too
so I know the place pretty well. Currently I work at
Charing Cross hospital doing research into Parkinson’s
disease.”
My... money saving tip
“My tip is buy Time Out, as they quite often have ‘2 for
1’ deals on museums and restaurants and the Time Out
night pass which gets you money off club entry. Also
when you’re totally skint it tells you lots of cool things to
do and places to go for free!”
My... favourite day out
“Watching cricket or rugby with my mates, or just chill-
ing out by going someplace like Portobello market with
my girlfriend followed by dinner in town.”
