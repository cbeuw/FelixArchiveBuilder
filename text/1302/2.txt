This week, the long-awaited
review of the British exam
system was published by the
former head of Ofsted, Mike
Tomlinson. Making radical
new proposals, he suggested
scrapping the endless public
examinations and arduous
A level system, replacing it
with a diploma system that
allows more leeway for both
the more and less academi-
cally gifted pupils.
The diploma would replace
all secondary school exams,
running from ages 14 to
19, and the pupils would be
allowed to take it at their own
pace. The brightest students
would complete A level-style
exam questions, includ-
ing some questions closer
to degree level, and would
complete a long dissertation
aimed at allowing universi-
ties more opportunities to
choose between students at
the admissions stage. In addi-
tion, all the grades the pupil
had ever achieved would be
available to universities, so
students would not be able
to repeat a module several
times and only report the best
score, as is the case now.
Other students would be
able to take more vocational
qualifications, but no-one will
be able to graduate with the
diploma without reaching
basic standards in literacy,
maths and information tech-
nology. Students will be able
to choose a number of mod-
ules, either a broad range for
more able pupils or a series
that add up to a complete
diploma in, for example, lei-
sure and tourism.
Some of the more radical
suggestions involve including
students’ after-school activi-
ties, voluntary work and hob-
bies in the diploma, and there
being an oral exam to test
students properly and ensure
all the work is their own.
There was widespread
approval of the plans when
they were announced, with
headteachers welcoming
the changes. Parents were
also expected to approve,
particularly those worried
about over-testing children
– the diploma would involve
no coursework other than the
extended dissertation.
However, the brief but wel-
come moment of unity was
broken when, confusingly,
the Prime Minister gave a
speech in which he appeared
to suggest that the diploma
would not replace but rather
‘strengthen’ GCSEs and A
levels. Mr Blair and Charles
Clarke, the Education
Secretary, appeared not to
wholeheartedly support the
ideas, despite lobbying by
teaching groups. They may
have been worried by reports
that business leaders were
not convinced that the advan-
tages brought by the new
system would be worth the
disruption and difficulty
caused by introducing it.
Businesses have long com-
plained about the decline
in literacy and numeracy
in trainees, and on Monday
they suggested that the diplo-
ma would not do enough to
improve them.
Itmaybethatfurthertweak-
ing of the plans are necessary
to satisfy all sides, although
with a ten-year introduction
timetable, there is plenty of
time for that.
Confusion over changes to British exam system
By Dave Edwards

A record number of voters
participated in the recent
elections of Imperial College
Union Council members,
ULU delegates, academic
representatives, Faculty
Union officers and members
of other Union committees.
However, only 15 of the 40
posts were filled as voters
expressed their dissatis-
faction with the candidates
by choosing to ‘Re-Open
Nominations’ (RON).
The results were due to
be announced at Monday’s
meeting of Union Council.
However, the counting soft-
ware in use was only designed
to count 1000 votes, and there
were 1093. Consequently, the
meeting was delayed for 40
minutes as staff, who had
already been counting the
votes by hand throughout the
day, tried to complete this
arduous task.
16 people were to be elect-
ed to Union Council, but only
Omar Abbara, Lucy Abbott,
Henry Chan, Amanda Clarke
and Morten Olesen finished
ahead of RON, so there will
be a new election for the
remaining 11 places.
Daniel O’Connell, Tom
Tibbits and Henry Chan were
elected to the Trading and
Retail Committee, with RON
in fourth place, leaving one
vacancy.
Daniel Carrivick was
the only student elected to
Services Committee, which
now has three vacancies.
Pranati Joshi was the only
one elected to the Student
Development Committee.
RON triumphed in the elec-
tion to House Committee, so
four vacancies remain. RON
was also victorious in the
election for ULU delegates.
Several people suggested
that the remaining positions
should be filled by electing
from the floor at the meet-
ing, “for the sake of prag-
matism” and because they
believed that far fewer people
would vote in any new elec-
tion. These suggestions were
rejected, as it was deemed
unacceptable to have certain
members elected by cross-
campus ballot and others cho-
sen by “40 people in a room”.
The Union constitution
states that new elections to
the remaining positions must
be held within ten College
days of the results being
announced. The President’s
interpretation of this is that
nominations must close by
Tuesday 2 November at the
latest.
This year, for the first
time, elections to the posts
in question took place online
by cross-campus ballot.
Previously, they took place
at the first Union Council
meeting of term, meaning
that the only people voting
were those present in the
room at the time. The new
system has obviously led to a
huge increase in turnout, giv-
ing those elected a far larger
mandate than their pred-
ecessors. The recent ‘VOTE’
publicity campaign appears
to have been particularly
successful in persuading stu-
dents to exercise their demo-
cratic right.
Mustafa Arif, Union
President, said: “It’s a long
time since we’ve had a good
RON turnout. I’m just glad
the students are voting.”
When asked whether RON
could also win the new elec-
tions, he added: “It obviously
is a concern, but this is what
democracy is there for. If peo-
ple don’t have confidence in
those standing for election
and want to vote RON, then
that’s what they’re entitled to
do. What I hope will happen
now is that others will see fit
to stand who didn’t, and that
those who failed to inspire the
electorate this time around
will try a little harder to cam-
paign for votes.”
● Meanwhile, also at the
Imperial College Union
Council meeting on Monday,
Mustafa Arif survived a vote
of confidence in his presiden-
cy. Having offered his res-
ignation last week and then
changed his mind the follow-
ing day, Mr Arif felt it neces-
sary to seek the backing of
the Council, which he duly
received.
