Feedback for your Union’s future
Feedback is an interesting word
which we believe can really make
sure that the Union is serving you
across all our commercial and non-
commercial services, including sup-
port for clubs and societies.
This week sees the launch of a
series of initiatives to improve the
feedback we receive from students
and enhance our response to your
views.
We start with ‘Your Say’, which
builds upon the existing system
but aims to provide greater clar-
ity and easier participation. You will
see simple feedback forms placed
around the Union building and cam-
pus. We welcome your comments
and look forward to receiving them
and acting on them. When a stu-
dent completes a feedback form, we
guarantee that a response will be
available online at www.union.ic.ac.
uk/yoursay within seven days. In
addition, responses will be posted
on the notice boards in the Union
foyer and the Student Activities
Centre. As well as filling in a feed-
back form, you can also contact us
on yoursay@imperial.ac.uk.
So please do use ‘Your Say’ as
an opportunity to provide construc-
tive feedback. Your views are vital
to us in ensuring that Union serv-
ices respond to your needs and
wants. Feedback will also allow us
to explain why things are done, and
either allow us to change them to
better reflect what you want or at
least let you know why things you
want can’t happen, due perhaps to
legal or financial constraints.
In addition to the ‘Your Say’ pro-
gramme of regular feedback, this
term we will also be embarking
on College-wide market research
– professional surveying of students’
opinions. This will form part of our
submission to the Quality Assurance
Agency’s audit of the College (more
on this in coming weeks) as well
as gaining valuable input from
you to the strategic review that will
be undertaken by the Union this
term.
The strategic review will be look-
ing at the future strategy of our
Union and how best we can channel
our resources to deliver high quality
services and make the Union work
for you. Through this, we hope to
develop a plan of how the Union
will evolve over the next few years,
and put us in a strong position for
extra recurrent funding and capital
investment.
The strategic review will also help
us develop a masterplan for the
Union building. We have an excel-
lent spacious building, but it needs
refurbishment and changes in order
to serve our students better. For
this, the relevant committees and
those using the building will be
called upon to work, together with
the results of our market research,
on what the Union plans for the
future.

SAMEENA MISBAHUDDIN
DEPUTY PRESIDENT
(FINANCE & SERVICES)
Last week we held a cross campus
ballot election for members of Union
Council and its Committees. Council
is the Union’s “parliament”. It sets
Union policy and holds Officers (like
myself) to account. It is incredibly
important that we have a full, elect-
ed Council, so that it has legitimacy
in acting as the representative voice
of students.
One of the absurd aspects of Union
Council is that in the past it has been
“elected” by the people who turned
up to the first meeting – typically no
more than about 50 or 60 students
– out of a population of over 10,000.
I took the view that this had to stop
and this year instigated the online
cross-campus ballot. It wasn’t per-
fect but it was the first time that the
vast majority of students had had a
genuine opportunity to elect their
Councilors. As you will have read
elsewhere in Felix, the result was
a very large victory for RON (Re-
Open Nominations). So there will be
a new set of elections.
Why?
Why did so many of you vote for
a new election? Why, in so many
cases, as a result of second or third
preferences after your first choice
candidate? Various Union ‘types’
have made representations to me
requesting that I remove the RON
option from the new set of elections.
(I can’t actually do this, by the way,
without first getting approval from
the College Council to suspend our
regulations). Whilst I am prepared
to contemplate getting rid of RON
it makes me deeply uncomfortable
and I am loathe to do it.
What is RON there for? It is an
opportunity for the electorate (in
this case, you, the students) if you
believe that it is better to have a
new election than to have any of
the (remaining) candidates elected.
That option should always be there
but it should never be taken lightly.
Did you really think the candidates
were that bad?
Did you understand the Single
Transferable Vote (STV) voting sys-
tem? Did you realise that you are
supposed to list candidates in order
of preference until you have no fur-
ther preference? Did you realise
that voting RON as number 2 does
not in any way increase the chanc-
es of your first choice candidate of
being elected?
Where now?
There will be a new election for the
majority of posts that were con-
tested in the last set of Union elec-
tions. I was very pleased with the
turnout of 1093 compared to about
50 last year. However, I need people
to not vote RON and elect a full set
of Councilors. How do we make this
happen?
Would more incentives for voting
really help? Do you need more infor-
mation about the candidates? Do
you want information in different
ways?
Should the Union better promote
elections and what they are intended
for? Do you appreciate the respon-
sibilities associated with the posi-
tions that you are electing? Should
we make it easier for candidates to
stand (if you were genuinely worried
about the quality of candidates)?
Basically, I can’t read your minds
(most of the time). And ultimately
I’m here to serve you. Elections
are fundamental to the democracy
of any students’ union and we have
to make them work. If you have any
ideas please, please suggest them
to us. Pop in and chat, or email
elections@ic.ac.uk.
“Hey, buddy! How’s it going?” A
familiar and friendly form of address,
perhaps, but what is a buddy? Hours
of meticulous research revealed that
a buddy is “a good friend; a com-
rade”, but why am I talking about
buddies here?
Well, the Buddies Scheme at
Imperial is a system of pairing up
freshers with continuing students.
It’s as simple as that! But how does
it work? Well, each Faculty Union
runs a slightly different scheme. For
instance, Imperial College School
of Medicine Students’ Union calls
its buddies ‘Mums’ and ‘Dads’, and
pairs them up with a fresher of
the opposite sex. For entirely inno-
cent reasons, I am told. In certain
Engineering departments, on the
other hand, precisely the opposite
approach is taken, as females are in
short supply.
Most departments stump up
some cash for a Buddies’ Lunch in
Freshers’ Week, presumably under
the assumption that most of Mum’s
hunger relief packages have been
eaten by the end of the week. The
Buddies’ Lunch is a good opportu-
nity for freshers to meet their bud-
dies, alleviate some of their initial
concerns, learn a few things about
the course, and obtain some inside
knowledge. Departmental Societies
usually exploit such occasions to
publicise their existence and plug
their events.
Some Faculty Unions are running
follow-up buddies’ events, which
range from parties to milkshake and
doughnut giveaways. Sometimes
they work well, although this very
much depends on the relationships
that exist between freshers and
their buddies. The most success-
ful way of getting students together
appears to be by offering free food.
I guess we are all united by the fact
that we have to eat!
Whilst some Faculty Unions take
care to match freshers to buddies
who have similar interests or back-
grounds, others leave it to chance,
and in any case, it is never possible
to ensure that buddies and freshers
will actually get along. In the best
case scenario, the relationship will
be a constructive one which will
help the fresher to settle in more
easily, and may even develop into
a friendship.
Well, what am I getting at? I think
the Buddies Scheme is a good idea,
which generally works well, but
needs to be built on in the future. I
am going to be getting the organ-
isers together to discuss ways in
which we can make it even bet-
ter, so if you have any suggestions,
please get in contact. To open anoth-
er can of worms entirely, should
postgraduates have buddies? Let
me know!
On a personal note, if you are a
buddy and have not been in contact
since Freshers’ Week, it might be a
nice idea to remind your freshers
that you still exist and are there to
help if they have any concerns.
Elections
I could not let this week pass with-
out mentioning the E-word. As
many of you will know, we held some
elections last week for positions on
Council, various committees, and
some Faculty Unions [see News,
page 2]. We put a lot of effort into the
publicity of what became known as
the “VOTE” campaign, because we
wanted to achieve a higher turnout
than ever before.
I am delighted to report that more
than 1000 people made the effort to
vote, about thirty times more than
last year. Throwing myself into this
project has been an enjoyable and
rewarding experience, and I’d like
to thank all the members of staff and
part-time officers who helped, and,
of course, all of you for voting!
