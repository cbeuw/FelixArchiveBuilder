most likely you’ll find yourself refill-
ing water bottles from the unisex
toilets for most of the night.
The somewhat restrictive prices
are compensated for by the awe-
some light displays, which are some
of the best imaginable. The lights,
the music, the DJs, the MCs, the
atmosphere... the list is endless,
so if you’re into drum and bass,
I would definitely recommend you
pay Fabric a visit. I’ll see you there.

So, Fabric is five. Five years on,
and it’s still going strong. Stronger
than ever, it would appear. I arrived
shortly before midnight – somewhat
stupidly, as I knew this was going to
be a busy one – and the queue was
leading around the corner and down
towards the tube station. Not a good
sign. If I hadn’t had a ticket I doubt
I would have waited. As we entered,
security looked about ready to turn
away the majority of the waiting
masses.
I remember last year’s birthday
weekend, when they brought free
drinks into the middle of the dance-
floor just before chucking out time,
and someone threw a load of glow
sticks into the crowd (quite shock-
ing considering they are banned in
the club), so I had been looking
forward to this night for a long time,
especially since I hadn’t been down
the giant staircase in a good few
months.
Onceinside,Iwaseagertogetright
into the midst of things, so it was
straight into the main room for me.
I have to admit I was slightly taken
aback, as the place wasn’t jumping
like I had expected. Electronic duo
Death In Vegas were in the middle
of their live set, which seemed odd
to me – usually at FabricLive the
live acts perform first, then clear
the stage for the clubbers. Tonight,
however, it seemed I had missed
Stanton Warriors and Richard
Fearless. Death In Vegas were play-
ing their signature style of dirty
electronica, and, whilst intense and
atmospheric, the beat rarely got fast
enough to have a proper dance to.
Moving into Room 2, I found
similarly downbeat proceedings, so
headed up to Room 3 to check out
Talvin Singh on the decks.
Talvin is an astounding artist. His
production work is a beautiful fusion
of Eastern and Western sounds, and
I have a passion for his music. I
hadn’t ever seen him DJ, however.
In Room 3, he was spinning what
was at the time the most upbeat
music in the place, though I have to
say it didn’t really sound like him.
He was playing a dubby kind of
house, but I gave him the benefit of
the doubt and over the next hour or
so the sound progressed and got a
lot more interesting, causing me to
get a right old wiggle on as he start-
ed bringing elements of bhangra
and other more esoteric styles into
the mix.
Before long, I felt the urge to check
out Room 1 again, especially as I
knew breakbeat god Adam Freeland
was playing. Just as Death In Vegas
were finishing, the room, and the
whole club, seemed a lot more full
than when I had arrived, as if the
wandering masses had swarmed to
see Freeland. I wouldn’t blame them
– he’s at the forefront of his scene
and has been all over the place
recently. You probably know him
best for his danced-up version of the
White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army
or his beatsy bootleg of Smells Like
Teen Spirit, but his own tracks, such
as We Want Your Soul, have been
just as popular. If you want to hear
what this man is all about, check out
his FabricLive 16 mix CD for a nice
slice of dark and growling breakbeat
pie.
The breakbeat scene has exploded
in the past few years, but it’s not a
new sound. Ask any old school raver
– dance music has always had a lot
of breaks in it, right from the start.
What I’m referring to came out of
the garage scene a few years ago, as
producers took the two-step beats
and heavy bass and left out the
sexy soulfulness to create warping,
bumping, grinding music which had
a fresh sound about it. These days,
breaks is massive, taking in ele-
ments of house, hip-hop and drum
and bass, as well as a fair amount of
remixing and re-remixing (notably
the Plump DJs’ rework of Donna
Summer’s I Feel Love).
Step onto a dancefloor when a
man like Freeland is playing, and
you’ll soon see what the hype is all
about. People go wild for this music
– the beats, being more varied and
sometimes more random compared
to straight, four-to-the-floor house,
give rise to some crazy body mov-
ing, twisting and jerking. Add to this
basslines that could rearrange your
internal organs, and you’re surfing
on a wave of sound. And it feels
good.
Freeland’s set lived up to my
expectations 100%. It was tight,
resounding and fresh. The crowd
loved it, and so did I.
Next up were the Plump DJs. The
Plumps are just as big as Freeland,
but with a slightly different take
on the breakbeat vibe, favouring a
more funky, disco sound. Tonight,
however, they went straight for the
juggular, with beats sounding hard-
er and basslines deeper than what
had come before. They rocked and
twisted the crowd right through to
the end of the night, which was
my only real disappointment. You’d
expect, for their birthday, that the
club would stay open a little longer,
but tonight the lights came up as
usual, and it was game over. Fair
enough really, we all had beds to go
home to, and it had been one hell of
a night.

Birthday Bonanza
Last weekend, London superclub Fabric celebrated its fifth birthday. Felix was there to check out the party
Fabric cannot have escaped your
attention. Not only is it one of the
biggest clubs in town with a capac-
ity of around 3000, but their public-
ity is almost ubiquitous – you will
be handed stylishly designed Fabric
flyers on your way out of almost any
club, as well as gigs and concerts.
Situated in Farringdon, Fabric has
built up an incredible reputation –
some people don’t go anywhere else.
FabricLive (Fridays) and Fabric
(Saturdays) are two of the most
consistently solid nights out in town,
with impressive line-ups of live acts
covering the spectrum of music with
breaks, drum and bass and house,
athough the music policy explicitly
states ‘no trance’!
Last weekend, Fabric was five.
The celebrations were held over
three days, with the club unusually
open on a Thursday night for a pure
drum and bass mash up, and Friday
and Saturday in the familiar format.
Nacho Quinones went down on
Thursday to check out the action,
and I was there for all the fun on
Friday.

CLUB REVIEWS
So I went to Fabric on Thursday. The
line-up for the whole weekend was
impressive, but on Thursday it was
immense!
All your favourite drum and bass
DJs were there: Grooverider, Nicky
Blackmarket (who kicked ass in dBs
last year), Goldie and DJ Hype, back
to back with the grandaddy of drum
and bass, Andy C. Individually, wick-
ed. Combined? Unmissable!
On the Circle Line, I was sur-
rounded by baggy-trousered, bling
bling, red-eyed clubbers all shaking
with anticipation. When we got to
Farringdon it was pretty much a
race to beat the omnipresent Fabric
queue, which to everyone’s surprise
was notable by its absence. Once
inside, the club was pretty packed
but not quite as full as it can get,
probably due to the midweek effect.
Basically, Fabric is made up of
three main rooms and a couple of
chill-out areas. I say “chill-out” in
the loosest of terms here, because
the music is too damn phat to sit
down, so most people use the couch-
es as platforms really. As for the
main rooms, there is usually dif-
ferent music in each one, but this
Thursday it was drum and bass eve-
rywhere, which I guess was Fabric’s
way of celebrating the fact that it is
one of the main drum and bass ven-
ues in the world.
Room 1 was the arena for the main
acts and I found myself spending
most of the night there. Grooverider
kicked off with some of the phattest
basses that I’ve ever heard and the
occasional slip-up was swiftly cov-
ered by some skilful MCing.
The main dish of the night was
Andy C. This was obvious judging
by how packed the room got when
he came in. To be fair, at Fabric you
can always expect a good amount
of the old elbow-in-the-ribs, but I
would have to say that Andy C is too
popular for his own good. He was as
great as people tell you he is, but the
overcrowding in the room was as
irritating as it was unavoidable.
The other rooms were compara-
tively empty, but the tunes were just
as kicking with the added bonus of
extra breathing space. The staircas-
es are a popular area to gather what
remaining strength you have left to
get through the rest of the night. But
you’ll find that you’re not alone, as
this is the place where most people
come to chill, have a smoke and
decide on the next room to hit.
Drinks at Fabric are at average
club prices, which is bad news for us
students! I would definitely recom-
mend that you get plenty of pre-club
drinks in before you get in there, as
