It has been almost two years since
the row over top-up fees erupted.
Buried beneath news that Imperial
was entering merger talks with
UCL (which subsequently collapsed,
largely due to staff and student pes-
simism) were disturbing mumblings
from the Rector, Sir Richard Sykes,
that he was interested in raising tui-
tion fees to up to £3000 per year. So
where are we two years later?
Not so long ago, students received
a maintenance grant to help pay
their living costs, with student loans
covering the gap. Fees didn’t enter
into the equation. The explosion in
the number of A-level leavers enter-
ing higher education in the mid-nine-
ties necessitated a change in tack,
and the current system was born in
1998. The maintenance grant was
abolished, student loans increased
accordingly and tuition fees of £1000
(now £1150) per year introduced, pay-
able up-front. Means testing reduces
the burden of these fees on students
from poorer backgrounds – current-
ly only 48% of students dependent
on their parents pay the full amount,
with 35% paying nothing at all.
Collectively, students now owe
£14bn, and that doesn’t even include
“hidden” student debts on credit
cards, overdrafts and other borrow-
ing. Then there’s the interest, which
is supposedly just to cover inflation
– the current rate is 3.1%, but the
consumer price index recently fell
to 1.1%. Something fishy is happen-
ing there.
For better or worse, this system
is on the way out, so let’s move on
to the Labour government’s new
idea. Loans stay as they are with
“modest” increases, but tuition fees
become variable – instead of the flat
£1150 fee, universities become free
to charge anything between zero and
a top rate of £3000 per year. Crucially,
the payment of fees is deferred until
after graduation – in effect, it adds
to the student loan burden, and is
repaid in a similar fashion: 9% on
earnings above £15,000 per year.
Attacks on the proposals take
multiple forms. Firstly, variable tui-
tion fees inevitably create an educa-
tion market, where price becomes
a selection criterion for university
entrants considering where to go
and what to study. The knee-jerk
reaction to this is disdain – students
shouldn’t be basing their education
choices on cost. On the other hand,
price variation introduces another
element of competition into the sys-
tem, perhaps boosting the incentives
for universities to improve teaching
quality to everyone’s benefit.
The universities themselves aren’t
keen on a price war – those charg-
ing low rates may be seen as sec-
ond rate, and admissions to more
expensive institutions could drop if
students start checking their bank
balances when filling in their UCAS
forms. In a recent BBC survey, 83
universities in England were asked
if they would charge the full £3000 in
fees, with 64% saying yes. Only 10%
would rule it out at this stage.
The exact amounts aside, should
we (as students) be paying at all?
Whenever fees are debated, groups
like the NUS immediately start tell-
ing about student poverty, how none
of us can make ends meet, how we
must work 40 hours per week to the
detriment of our studies and so on.
Unfortunately, all these arguments
against the new fee proposals are
void thanks to deferred repayment.
In fact, by removing the current
up-front fee, access to university
should become easier for those on
a low income. Critics argue that the
prospect of debt in the longer term
will still deter those whose income
is low now. However, since repay-
ments only begin when the debtor
can afford them, is it really fair to
expect someone else to foot the bill
for irrational thinking?
I also believe that tuition fees act
as a useful deterrent to higher edu-
cation – now before you spit your
coffee all over your Felix, hear me
out. Not everyone needs or wants
to go to university. Some people are
at university simply because their
parents want them to be. If there’s
one thing that fees achieve – espe-
cially up-front fees – it is to make A
level students (and their sometimes
pushy parents) think more carefully
about whether continuing their edu-
cation at university is actually going
to be worthwhile for them.
Don’t get me wrong – we should
encourage people from all back-
grounds to seek their educational
goals. Where appropriate, grants
should be offered (the only point
that all the main political parties can
agree on), but perhaps not spread as
liberally as some would argue. For
example: student comes from a poor
background and receives significant
grants during education. After grad-
uation, they convert their university
education into a high earning job,
perhaps earning more than some-
one from a wealthier background. So
why should they repay less?
For some time, the Conservatives
have proudly boasted that they
would scrap all fees, much to the
rejoicing of the NUS and students
in general. Unfortunately they then
blew it by revealing exactly how they
would fund higher education – by
pushing up interest rates on student
loans to commercial rates, capped
at 8%. Currently the rate would be
around 6.5%.
Control of the loans would pass to
the universities themselves, so the
cash raised from loan interest would
pay for teaching. The Conservatives
estimate that this will raise £20bn
over a 20 year period.
It’s easy to see right through this
cynical scheme – not only do they get
to grab the headlines with “Tories
pledge to scrap tuition fees”, but
they satisfy their middle class roots
by taxing the poor to pay for the
rich. Think about it – richer families
won’t take out the loan, so don’t
pay the higher interest, and simply
benefit from having no fees to pay.
Effectively they get a free education
paid for by those of us supporting
ourselves on loans.
Let’s not forget that there are also
graduates who don’t exploit their
assumed graduate earning potential.
Sticking with relatively low-paid jobs,
be it by choice or otherwise, rewards
you with a debt mountain that grows
at an unmanageable rate.
What the Tories have inadvert-
ently done is agreed with Labour,
saying that students, not taxpayers,
should pay for their education. All
they disagree on is the nitty-gritty of
how and when they should pay.
There is one redeeming quality
of their plans, in that they want to
allow students to take out greater
loans to cover their living expenses.
There is definitely an argument that
the current loans are insufficient. I
receive the full loan of £5050 per year.
Supposedly, this should cover my
expenses for the whole 12 months,
which works out to just over £97
per week. A little more room to
manoeuvre in the form of higher
loans wouldn’t hurt.
Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats
are the only party that will stand
up and declare that all taxpayers,
not just graduates, should pay for
higher education. They propose to
scrap all fees and foot the bill by
creating a new top rate of income tax
of 50% on earnings above £100,000.
Currently the top rate is 40% on
earnings above £40,000. As with the
other two parties, their proposals
include grants of up to £2000 per
year to help with living costs for the
poorest students.
This plan deals neatly with the
problem of graduates not achieving
their supposed earning power, since
they won’t reach the higher tax rate.
Supporters agree that taxpayers in
general should shoulder the cost,
since education benefits the entire
economy.
The problem is that a large number
of taxpayers will resent paying for
other people’s education, especially
when students have a reputation for
gettingupjustintimeforCountdown
and then going drinking until chuck-
ing-out time. This stereotype will
only get worse as the Government
continues to insist that 50% of school
leavers should go to university.
While we’re on the subject
of the 50% target, what does the
Government think will happen to
graduate salaries when the labour
market is flooded with university
leavers in the next decade? Supply
and demand, anyone?
It’s easy to say “scrap fees, bring
back the grant”, but life isn’t that
simple. Education will always have
a price tag on it, as everything does
– it’s a question of who pays, how
they pay and when they pay. So how
should it be done? Here’s my eight
point guide to solving this situation
to (almost) everyone’s satisfaction:
● Keep tuition fees capped at around
the £1,000 per year mark, but defer
payment to post-graduation.
● Abandon the 50% target, and pro-
vide more information about non-
university alternatives after A level.
● Increase the available student
loan by around £1000 per year, ie give
people enough money so they can
actually live off the loan.
● Drop the interest rate on student
debt to more accurately reflect the
current inflation rate.
● Increase the earnings threshold
before loan repayments start to
£20,000 per year.
● Scrap all means testing – since
fee repayment is linked to graduate
earnings, no differentiation is need-
ed. Loans need to be available to
all, regardless of what their parents
should contribute, since not all par-
ents are willing to do so. Removing
means testing will also reduce the
administrative workload in the stu-
dent finance system – we all know
the dreaded forms!
● Cover the funding gap by intro-
ducing a new top rate of income tax
of 45% on earnings above £100,000
per year (the precise percentage
and threshold should be adjusted to
make the numbers add up!)
● Encourage business to pay off
their employees’ student debts with
tax incentives.
So students pay a bit when they
can afford to, taxpayers pay a bit
when they can afford to, and nobody
should be hard up during their edu-
cation. There, sorted. Next week I’ll
tackle world peace.

Who pays, how and when?
The major political parties’ views on university funding
Bike racks: no ‘joy’
Dear Dave,
I am writing to express my disap-
pointment at the Deputy President
(Education and Welfare)’s column
[‘The joy of... Bike Sheds’] in last
week’s Felix. Let me put my opinion
in perspective with a few facts:
Fact 1: The new bike “cage” can’t
be rejected out of hand. Some peo-
ple want secure bike parking and so
it’s not a bad thing.
Fact 2: Most cyclists would much
prefer the convenience of parking
near their department to the safety
of parking in the cage. If you don’t
believe this, take a stroll down to the
cage some afternoon and count the
number of free spaces in the bike
rack outside it – I guarantee it’ll be
less than five. Even when they are
physically there, people choose not
to use the cage.
Fact 3: The “strategic concen-
tration of bike parking” means the
removal of much-used and conven-
ient bike racks that caused no has-
sle to other users of the college. It
means a reduction in real terms of
the number of bike space available
to students. Apparently the Rector
ordered a cleanup of Imperial
College Road and hence the racks
were removed. Maybe I’ve missed
the point but isn’t the Union meant
to protect the students from exactly
this kind of facetious nonsense?
I challenge anyone to explain to
me how the overall situation for bike
users of this College has improved
over the summer. There is no way
the College has done this with the
students’ interests in mind, and
there is no way our union should
have supported this event.
I voted for a president whose cam-
paign posters advertised “600 new
bike parking spaces for College”. I
voted for a DP(E&W) who I thought
would put student needs first. I can
accept that they have been out-
maneuvered by College on this sub-
ject, but to then turn around and
support college’s actions in Felix is
unacceptable.
To paraphrase our president’s
recent column, “Elected student
officers hold a position of trust.
What is trust?”. Trust is not letting
the college push through a poli-
cy which inconveniences the stu-
dents when they’re not even here
to defend themselves, and trust is
certainly not publishing a defence of
those very actions after it’s too late
to reverse them. Well done to Sam
for organizing a meeting, but take
it from me and my six years at this
College, I guarantee you those bike
racks will never reappear in College.
We had our chance to stop this and
we missed it.
Yours,
Philip Bates
PhD student, Physics
● Sam Rorke, Deputy President
(Education & Welfare), replies:
The initial impetus for the College’s
new secure cycle parking facility
came directly from the students,
represented by the Union, as the
high incidence of bike crime has
been a longstanding concern. I
think this is what you are alluding
to in “Fact 1”. Two ways of doing
this were identified as providing
secure facilities, and concentrating
parking in locations that could be
better monitored.
In response to Fact 3, you don’t
always get what you want in life.
We have fought hard to get a solu-
tion that bike users and College are
happy with. We have more spaces
now than a year ago. The Rector
has decided that he wants bike
racks to be removed from Imperial
College Road and located elsewhere
on the College Estate; Mustafa has
spoken to him about this, and the
only way he is going to change his
mind is if we can show that there
is now insufficient cycle park-
ing space. He won’t have much
sympathy for cyclists who consid-
er it a divine right to park out-
side their building, and will now
have to walk for an extra couple of
minutes.
The fact that people park their
bikes outside the Faculty Building
is entirely their own business. If
they do not want to use the facilities
that have been provided, then that’s
not a problem.
