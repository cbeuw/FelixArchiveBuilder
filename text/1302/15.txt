Louden up, kids
One of the few good bands to come out of the supposed dance-punk revival, !!! brought
their insane live show to the city. Tom Hampton was there for Felix

LIVE REVIEW
!!! (most frequently pronounced
‘chk chk chk’) crashed into the indie
limelight recently on the crest of a
wave of similar New York dance-
punk bands such as The Rapture
and Radio 4. However, !!!’s sound is
truly their own. A mix of fashionistas
and other student types greeted the
eight-strong band at the Astoria,
ready for a heady mix of energy-
filled dance numbers taken mostly
from the new album Louden Up
Now.
Throughout the evening, three
circular projection screens burnt a
sequence of dazzling, progressively
more psychedelic images onto an
audience already bathed in thick
percussive beats, swirling guitar
lines and copious flashes of strobe
lighting.
Lead singer Nic Offer cavorted
wildly, dancing cathartically, rigid-
ly, often just plain stupidly to the
music behind him, all without a hint
of irony. Well, maybe just a small
hint. After barking incomprehensi-
ble vocals and occasionally resort-
ing to making abstract noises and
breathing sounds, it was all change
as drummers took vocals, guitarists
played keyboards, bassists picked
up trumpets and someone, some-
where, hit a cowbell or two.
Multi-instrumentalists abound in
this band, and the fired-up punk
aesthetic coupled with programmed
beeps, tweaks and trance-esque spi-
ralling song structures made for an
embracing experience.
Stand out tracks were difficult to
pick out; the well-known Me And
Giuliani… single, stretched out to
over eight minutes, caused the big-
gest crowd response. Fun was had
by all, ranging from gently swaying
heads to rave-dancing in pockets,
all rippling through the crowd. Nic
interacted with the audience well,
despite splitting his jeans, and there
were several well-intentioned mini
stage invasions, cheerfully resolved
by all involved. These were the
cause of much satisfaction to the
band, despite the bassist being con-
fused for a jubilant fan and getting
roughly handled himself towards
the end of the set!
There’s no pretending that !!!
will have a bestselling album, nor
will they achieve emphatic com-
mercial success with their brand of
experimental genre fusion.
However, their music and perform-
ance are so bubbling with crisp,
surging blasts of dance and new-
wave punk cool, leaving every mus-
cle in the body twitching excited-
ly, that the band deserve all their
recent superlative critical appraisal.
I can only recommend investigating
for yourself.

ALBUM REVIEWS
There are bands who constantly
develop their sound, striving to
evolve and move on, surprising fans
and critics alike with every release.
Then there are those who have found
their signature sound and decided to
stick with it. You hear them and say,
“that’s them, no question”.
It doesn’t take much cerebral
activity to work out which camp
Placebo belong to. No indeed, the
music industry’s most brazen nancy
boys found the noise they liked with
their debut, self-titled, album, and,
as this collection shows, they haven’t
felt the need to change it.
Their sound is an angsty nasal
whine backed up by droning gui-
tars and a solid, repetitive beat. An
acquired taste, it’s actually rather
more appealing than I’ve just made
out, although it really shouldn’t be.
It should be absolutely bloody awful,
and, while I don’t doubt that there
are millions of people who think
that it is, I can’t suppress a creep-
ing fascination for the crazy gay
Luxembourgers (is that a word?)
Yes, Brian Molko’s voice has a ten-
dency to give me a migraine after
too long. Yes, it’s as predictable as
the USA winning the World Series
(apart from that crazy rapping thing
they did on Black Market Music).
But there’s something hypnotic
about it all. Despite the occasion-
ally obscene lyrics, their music has
a friendly, soothing quality to it that
quite belies its superficial anger. Not
many groups consisting of a teeny-
tiny androgyne in lipstick, an impos-
sibly tall bassist and, er, that other
guy could come off as homely and
comforting as your favourite blanket
but, if you listen to them enough,
Placebo can manage it.
This collection of all their singles
is a brisk and faithful trot through a
successful but never stellar career,
and although it misses some of their
hidden album-only gems it’s consist-
ently interesting to fans. The most
exciting track, though, is one that
has never previously been avail-
able in the UK – Protège-Moi, the
French version of Protect Me From
What I Want, a song from their latest
album, Sleeping With Ghosts. In his
native language, Molko becomes
a husky little sexpot with a drawl
that could fell admirers at twenty
paces, rather than the shrill pixie
we’ve come to know. It’s a new and
noteworthy side to Placebo, as is
the short but mostly sweet new love
song I Do. The sound is no differ-
ent, but the emotions have changed,
becoming more tender and cutely
pathetic. Perhaps we are seeing pro-
gression here? I wouldn’t count on it,
but it’s a nice thought.
So, this is really one for collec-
tors, or beginners. However, I leave
you with this thought: the band was
formed when Molko accidentally ran
into his former classmate, bassist
Stefan Olsdal, in South Kensington
tube station. They’re local boys. Give
them a chance.

This album is long overdue. At
last, an indie band that’s neither
embarrassingly poppy (see Keane),
or blandly predictable (see Snow
Patrol or Thirteen Senses). This is
an album that will lead you into a
darkened room to whisper to you all
your darkest secrets, tuck you into
bed and kiss your cheeks, stained
by the tears it caused you to cry. It
is truly as overblown as that last
sentence, and yet darkly humble,
riddled by it’s own insecurities.
This strange schizophrenia
comes across clearly in the lyrics.
Lost In The Plot warns you “don’t
mess with our love, our love is so
much stronger”, whereas Pinned
Together, Falling Apart bites it’s
nails since it’s “petrified by the
thought of losing you, absolutely
horrified by the thought of losing
you”. The Dears are blessed with
the perfect vocalist for their style
in the form of Murray Lightburn.
His voice is rich, dark, deep and
smooth; confident yet tentative.
The album opens with We Can
Have It, with a fragile intro caress-
ing you with beautiful acoustic
guitar and vibraphone. It teases
you with this for two minutes
before exploding into a flurry of
overt instrumentation. Lightburn’s
vocals soar skywards for the rest of
the song, taking you along for the
ride, frantically promising you that
“you’re not alone” and sending the
hairs on the back of your neck into
cardiac arrest.
The instrumentation and musi-
cianship is breathtaking through-
out. Who Are You, Defenders Of The
Universe” is in sinister 6/8, blind-
ingly complex, and rocky to boot.
The Second Part and closer No
Cities Left both feature an accordi-
on, and flutes and strings are used
as staple instruments.
The variety on No Cities Left is
startling. Postcard From Purgatory
is echoey and loud, drenched in
feedback, and accelerates into a
psychedelic whirlwind of tambou-
rines, flutes and distorted guitars.
Never Destroy Us sounds like a
Bond theme, suave, sophisticated
and jazzy.
A couple of minor bad points:
Don’t Loose The Faith does abso-
lutely nothing, a very bland, going-
through-the-motions kind of song.
Expect The Worst/Cos She’s A
Tourist starts as one of the best
tracks, with choppy cellos, The
Omen style choir, an Arabian feel,
start stop rhythms and a tempo
change, but then drops of to noth-
ingness for six minutes.
Nothing you can love will ever be
perfect, a truth The Dears will hap-
pily impart to you before drowning
your sorrows with their genius mel-
ancholia. Essential listening; you
need this in your life.
