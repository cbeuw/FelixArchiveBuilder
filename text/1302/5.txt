On 1 October 2005, the pros-
pect of reducing soaring
greenhouse gas emissions
was made a reality when
Russia signalled that it is
ready to ratify the Kyoto pro-
tocol and become the final
country to join the climate
change treaty.
Now 30 industrialised coun-
tries have been legally bound
to this agreement. First initi-
ated in 1997, it states that by
the year 2012, member coun-
tries need to collectively cut
their emissions of six major
greenhouse gases to 4.8%
below 1990 levels.
The agreement is set to cre-
ate a multibillion pound car-
bon trading market, whereby
countries will be able to buy
and sell ‘saved’ carbon. So in
exceeding targets, a country
will be in the position to sell
its saved carbon credits to
countries who have failed to
meet theirs.
The EU has been set an
overall target of 8% reduc-
tions and the UK 12.5%, which
we are currently on target
to exceed by 3%. However,
plans to sell the UK’s saved
carbon will not go ahead as
it will apparently be required
to meet the more stringent
2012 plans.
Is this agreement enough?
Although ‘tougher targets’
are scheduled for 2012, to be
met by 2020, it is unclear how
rigorous these will be, and
a complete plan for future
emissions has not been
mapped out. Scientists claim
that a 60% reduction across
the world is essential in order
to lower runaway climate
change possibilities, mass
extinctions, and the severe
rises in sea levels feared.
Of course, the US still has
not changed tact on this
issue and refuses to sign
the treaty. It is not hard to
see why, given the current
administration’s well-docu-
mented financial links with
the multinational corporate
giants of America, who just
happen to be the companies
contributing the most to the
world’s carbon dioxide prob-
lem. Take for example the
Texan oil giant ExxonMobil,
selling petrol under the Esso
name, which produces more
than twice the CO2 pollution
of Norway, with the compa-
ny’s own figures citing its
2003 emissions as exceeding
135million tonnes of carbon
dioxide. The annual profits of
this company reached a mod-
est $17billion last year. With
no plans to implement reduc-
tions, ExxonMobil is one of
many US opponents of the
Kyoto agreement. So consid-
ering this and the fact that
the US is the world’s larg-
est polluter, will the protocol
have any effect?
For a significant decline in
global CO2 levels, all coun-
tries will need to commit.
However, developing coun-
tries and large polluters such
as China and India do not
have to comply with Kyoto.
So on its own the protocol
will not have any major effect
and, according to scientists, if
emissions start rising again
after 2012, the treaty will pre-
vent less than 0.1ºC of the
warming expected by 2050.
The Bush administration
claims that premature expen-
sive measures, such as those
being used for Kyoto imple-
mentation, are not as impor-
tant as research into better
emission-reducing technolo-
gies. However, whether they
maintain this stance when
they are left out of the mul-
timillion carbon market
remains to be seen.
The Kyoto agreement is a
step in the right direction,
but climate scientists want
to see a global cap of critical
gases put in place. Deciding
upon the individual quotas is
a difficult job to tackle, and
implementing these quotas
will prove expensive, but this
is an expense that cannot be
spared.

Changeover at ISS
A crew of three arrived suc-
cessfully at the International
Space Station (ISS) on Satur-
day on board a Soyuz space-
craft. They will spend the next
six months studying plant
growth and experimenting on
possible AIDS vaccines. Since
the Columbia shuttle disaster
last February, Russian space-
craft have provided the only
means of travelling to the ISS.
FDA approves microchip
implants
A Florida-based company, Ap-
plied Digital, has been given
the go-ahead to implant mi-
crochips in humans for the
purpose of storing an indi-
vidual’s medical records. The
makers of the grain-of-rice-
sized chip say it will carry
details of blood groups and
allergies that can be used in
emergencies.
Critical QC component
built
A team of physicists at Pur-
due University has created
a device that can perform
spatial spin separation of the
‘holes’ in gallium arsenide.
This is thought to pave the
way for producing ‘spin-po-
larised’ streams of electrons.
With further development, the
device might play a key role in
a quantum microprocessor.
Surgery rebuilds
patient’s face
Doctors in Tokyo used a single
flap of skin from a patient’s
back to perform the first full
face reconstruction, including
the nose. The skin on the pa-
tient’s back was stretched us-
ing a silicone tissue expander
for six months, which caused
the skin to grow with its own
unique blood supply.
Magnetic stars puzzle
solved
Scientists at the Max Planck
Institute have discovered the
magnetic field configurations
behind the strong magnetic
fields observed on the sur-
faces of magnetic A-starts
and white dwarfs. The results
support a hypothesis propos-
ing that the magnetic fields
are remnants of the magnetic
field in the gas clouds from
which stars are born.
Draft of bovine genome
released
An international team based
in Houston is in the process
of reading through the cow’s
life code. The cow genome is
similar in size to the genomes
of other mammals. Scientists
believe the study could help
understanding of human ge-
netics and disease, as well as
improve the health of cattle.
Organic farming under the spotlight
New study questions whether organic is better for the environment
By James Berry
Biochemistry department
Organic farming does more
to enhance the countryside’s
wildlife than conventional
farming, claims a report pub-
lished last week in Science.
The rapid expansion of
the organic food market in
recent years, with growth
rates increasing between 30
and 50% per annum, is partly
due to the favourable effects
the public perceives organic
farming to have on the envi-
ronment.
Last year, sales of organic
foods in the UK exceeded
£1 billion for the first time.
The industry’s environmen-
tally dependable image will
soon be further strength-
ened, in terms of legislative
and financial assistance,
after recommendations from
the Government’s recent
Commission on the Future of
British Agriculture are car-
ried out.
Although the benefits of
eating GM and pesticide-free
food are not in question, big
business and environmental
awareness are often not seen
as compatible. The expan-
sion of conventional agricul-
ture over the next 50 years is
expected to challenge climate
change as the key threat to
global biodiversity [1]. So can
the billion dollar organic food
industry continue to trade off
its environmentally respon-
sible image forged during its
smallholding past? A report
published last week by the
RSPB and English Nature
[2], may help allay consumer
fears that ecological con-
cerns aren’t being bought off
with organic labels.
The study has taken data
from Europe, North America
and New Zealand, and
reviews the impacts on field
biodiversity by organic and
conventional farming prac-
tises. The majority of the 76
studies found that both spe-
cies richness and abundance
were improved under an
organic farming regime. Of
the 99 sub-studies, examin-
ing various taxa, 67% were
in favour of organic farming,
with only 8% against.
Skylarks, greenfinches and
blackbirds were found to be
more prevalent on chemi-
cal-free organic farms; their
numbers supported by the
boosted invertebrate popula-
tions. Linnets, by compari-
son, who feed from oil seed
rape seeds common on both
types of field, showed no dis-
cernible difference in popula-
tion. Also, although organic
farming was not generally
shown to affect small mam-
mal populations, clear dif-
ferences in bat activity sug-
gested organic farms were
preferable. In fact, two bat
species, the greater and less-
er horseshoe bat, have been
found to only visit organic
farms.
It’s not just the absence of
pesticides that leads to great-
er biodiversity, but the rec-
ognition of the inter-depend-
ency between living organ-
isms. For example, the use of
manure instead of fertiliser
encourages soil microbes
and earthworms, who not
only provide a link in the food
chain, but enrich and aer-
ate the soil. Minimum tillage
modifies the floral communi-
ty by favouring annual plants
rich in nectar, as oppose to
slow growing perennials, ben-
efiting the pollenating insects
and their predators, and also
improving the field’s aesthet-
ic appeal. A holistic approach
optimises all aspects of the
field’s ecology, and aspires
to benefit both yield and sus-
tainability in contrast to the
continual human intervention
required to optimise yields on
conventional farms.
There are, of course, con-
sistency problems for a
review of this size. For exam-
ple, no account is made for
well-meaning conventional
farmers with a disposition
towards environmentally
responsible management
practises, or for farms on
which an organic transition
has only recently been made.
But although organic farm-
ing clearly has the potential
to support the myriad of
multi-networking organisms
that is field ecology, the eco-
nomic realities of the mar-
ketplace ensure that it will
always rely on the support of
the consumer.
