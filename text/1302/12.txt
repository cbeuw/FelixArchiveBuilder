Thursday 21 October 2004

Silwood Park Correspondant
Free coffee. That was what
was offered to the current
SilwoodExecutiveCommittee
to bribe them to get out of bed
and greet the newly arrived
freshers. Did it work? For
a few of us, yes! We may be
paid postgraduates, but once
a student, always a student
at heart!
Our temporary greeting
room was welcoming enough,
the smell of fresh (well, pow-
dered) coffee, biscuits and a
typical big warm grin greet-
ing you from the president.
If only it had been like that
all weekend. Saturday passed
with not much happening, so
in their wisdom the events
team decided to shepherd
all the new arrivals to one
of our “local” pubs. It was
only then that they realised
lots of people had turned up
today, resulting in the need
for multiple trips through the
winding streets of Berkshire,
gradually getting more intox-
icated. It was hard enough
getting everyone there while
sober, but getting them back,
well, at least we didn’t lose
anyone. That was to change
later in the week.
Slightlycalmereveningsfol-
lowed, such as a night in the
Silwood bar on the Sunday.
I’m not sure the Silwood bar
has had that many people
in it this side of Darwin’s
theory of evolution (for those
non-biologists – that’s quite a
while ago). Free alcohol was
on offer on the Tuesday with
a College-funded ‘meet and
greet’. We all got up on chairs
and said a few words, which
was rather ironic as I am
not allowed to use a step lad-
der for my research but am
allowed to stand on a chair to
encourage students to drink
and enjoy themselves!
Wednesday was supposed
to be about eating rather
than drinking – the ‘kitchen
crawl’ – but with some kitch-
ens supplying drink as well
as food for the judging com-
mittee (not that that swayed
our decision at all), it was
another hazy morning that
followed.
The Thursday brought what
for most was the highlight of
the first week, the local pub
crawl. Those of you living in
London may not understand
the excitement that goes with
this event out here as you
are constantly surrounded by
pubs, but here it takes real
dedication to get around all
of them. This is where the
events team organisation fal-
tered for the first time. The
theory isn’t hard: get from
pub A to pub B then pub
C, while avoiding the beer
monkey (more details to fol-
low). However, it’s a little
complicated when it’s dark
and only one person in the
group knows the way from
the third pub to the fourth,
despite the efforts of a helpful
but inebriated yokel. Anyway,
the upshot is that to my
knowledge only two people
were lost, myself being one!
Without a leader, everybody
soldiered on bravely and got
around all the pubs, and the
detached party regained con-
tact at the last pub just in
time for last orders.
Friday morning was hazier
than most and as a result only
a minibus of hardcore drink-
ers made it out to Reading for
clubbing, but those who did
were in for a treat. There was
Tom’s calm driving under
Clare’s navigation (or lack
of), and the barman was an
ex-Silwoodian and so gave
Silwood half pints to all.
Thankfully for many, the
cycle pub crawl and sports
were postponed as livers
cried out in unison for a day
off and the desire to remain
horizontal.
So it is from my room, while
almost horizontal, that I write
to inform the outside world of
the goings-on in this remote
part of the Imperial world. I
hope everyone else is having
half as much fun and not as
much getting lost as we are
out here.

Get out your magnifying
glasses and dust off your
pipes, as DramSoc cordial-
ly invites you to partake of
our freshers’ play: Sleuth, a
fiendish mystery by Anthony
Shaffer, ably directed by Mike
Wyer.
In a secluded Wiltshire
mansion, a detective story
writer is putting together the
finishing touches of his lat-
est masterpiece – a crime so
fiendishly clever, the police
would never be able to figure
it out.
The plan is put in motion,
and events gradually unfold
throughout the course of the
evening, leading to the dra-
matic climax. But all is not as
it seems, and a battle of wits
develops between the police
and the amateurs, all trying
to work out who did what and
when.
The mystery unfolds in
the Union Concert Hall on
Friday 22 and Sunday 24
October, starting at 7.30pm.
Tickets cost £2, but are free
to DramSoc members.
For those of you not con-
tent to simply observe,
who want to help shape
the suspense and guide the
intrigue, Saturday 23 October
will see the Sleuth direct-
ing workshop. Mike and his
cast will be on hand to help
you let your creativity loose.
In conjunction with this,
there will also be an acting
workshop, allowing you to
try out your performing
skills and learn some new
ones. To attend either the act-
ing or directing workshops,
turn up in dBs at 2pm on
Saturday.
For the more technically-
minded amongst you, there
will also be an opportunity
to “get your hands dirty” at
our tech workshop. Starting
at 11am, our “techies” will
guide you through the use of
the lighting and sound equip-
ment we employ in Sleuth
and other productions.
