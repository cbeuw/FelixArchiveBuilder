It was agreed on Friday that
students will retain their
place on the main governing
body of Imperial College.
Last month, Dr Eileen
Buttle, the acting Chairman
of Imperial College Council,
outlined her recommenda-
tions for sweeping changes to
the governance of the College,
as reported in Felix 1299.
Among these recommenda-
tions was the proposal that the
present student representa-
tive, the Union President, be
removed from the Council.
However, students have been
successful in lobbying against
this change, and at Friday’s
Council meeting it was decid-
ed that the President would
remain a member after all.
Mustafa Arif, the current
President of Imperial College
Union, told Felix: “Our efforts
in lobbying the key players
were successful, and it’s
a victory for student repre-
sentation. Dr Buttle agreed
to amend her proposals to
include the Union President
as a member of Council.”
Various other changes to
the governance of the College
will still go ahead, including
the downsizing of the Council
itself, which will in future con-
tain only one elected academ-
ic staff member. There are
currently six of these on the
governing body, and although
Dr Buttle’s initial proposal
was to remove them all, a
concession has been made
allowing a place for one of the
Deans.
Mr Arif was keen to point
out that, because the Council
will now have less members,
the level of student represen-
tation has actually increased
– instead of there being one
student member out of 25
(plus several observers),
there will now be one out of
19. He commented: “From a
student perspective, we’ve
gone from potentially zero
representation to something
that’s better than the present
situation.”
The new, smaller Council
will now discuss issues that
were previously covered by
committees which no longer
exist. This will give students
a direct input into these areas
for the first time.
The Council was wide-
ly expected to endorse the
original proposals, and the
amendment has been greeted
by many as a pleasant sur-
prise. When asked how he
and other student officers
had managed to convince
Council members of the need
for student representation,
Mr Arif replied: “The impor-
tant thing was to influence
the key decision-makers...
the most important people
were the Rector and the
Council Chairman. We had
lively discussions, but they
came round to it in the end,
and the Rector was very
supportive.”

Exam overhaul
A review of the British ex-
amination system suggests
replacing the current public
examinations with a diploma,
but the Government does not
seem to support the recom-
mendations in full.

Money matters
“Education will always have a
price tag on it, as everything
does – it’s a question of who
pays, how they pay and when
they pay. So how should it be
done?”

Mustafa Arif, President of Imperial College Union (third from left), announces the results of the recent elections to Union Council and various other
committees, in which record numbers of students voted. However, many voters were so unimpressed with the candidates that ‘Re-Open Nominations’
was particularly successful. As a result, there will now be new elections for the remaining 25 positions. Full story: page 2
