Latest from the Square Mile
Numaan Chaudhry presents an update on the proceedings of the past week
Ever wondered if there
would be a week in which
the world would just be ‘nor-
mal’? No bombs, no elections,
no defrauding, no takeovers.
Dream on... and read on!
Crude Oil
Crude oil continued to misbe-
have as it reached new record
levels of $55 per barrel, an
increase of $2 from this time
last week. Brent Crude Oil
Futures, the ‘cheaper’ ver-
sion of that traded in the US,
also rose in line with it’s past
performance to reach $51.50.
However, the effects of esca-
lating oil prices have not only
struck down company profits
but also affected the commod-
ities markets in general, with
clear evidence of unsettling
patterns at the International
Petroleum Exchange.
Copper, aluminium and
lead rose to new highs and
then dropped to levels seen
a decade ago, providing irref-
utable backing for the sug-
gestion that crude oil has
sent the market into turmoil.
Furthermore, many of the
airlines will respond to the
crude oil price spike by rais-
ing their fuel surcharge by up
to $2 and $8 for domestic and
international flights respec-
tively. Personally, I don’t see
the logic behind travelling by
air when you can go just as
quickly by Scaglietti.
Bush-Kerry Affair
With just over two weeks to
go until the 44th US presi-
dential election, it’s a race
for the two prime candidates
to convert as many citizens’
votes to their favour as pos-
sible. It appears as though
both candidates have a 50-50
chance of victory.
In the last few weeks, there
has been an extensive cam-
paign by both parties to con-
vince the public of the cor-
rectness of their stance on
issues such as healthcare,
pensions, economic and secu-
rity concerns, education and
of course the Iraq war. As for
the latter, Kerry has a decid-
edly strong stance that seems
to be winning over the public
en masse. Take, for example,
the debate on Wednesday last
week, where Kerry beat Bush
hands down, mainly due to
his stance on political and
ethical issues.
Bush doesn’t have a par-
ticularly strong foundation,
especially since he has had
four years to correct the state
of the economy, and all that
is evident after his term in
office is that countless jobs
have been lost, many more
companies are now outsourc-
ing, and in comparison to
Kerry’s productivity in the
Senate, not much has been
achieved.
Abbey National
The much awaited sell-out of
Abbey National to Santander
Central Hispano (BSCH), one
of Spain’s largest commercial
banks, was finalised this week
after months of speculation
and discussion. The £8.9bn
acquisition will supposedly
make the bank a ‘stronger
and a more competitive force
on the high street’, accord-
ing to Lord Burns, the much
jeered and heckled Abbey
chairman.
As for the intricacies of the
deal, they are very much sim-
ilar to most mergers or acqui-
sitions; it has been decided
that the name Abbey will stay,
3000 staff will be shown the
door, the chief executive will
be replaced and the pleas of
resistance of many investors
will be ignored. The final stag-
es of the deal, which involve
an approval by Spanish share-
holders and the go-ahead by
city regulators, are expect-
ed to be completed by 16
November. Upon completion
of this deal, being overlooked
by Morgan Stanley, Abbey can
look forward to being in the
list of the world’s top 10 larg-
est banks with an increase in
its consumer dealings and a
much wider client base.
For those of you who have
a stake in Abbey, the date for
your diary is 15 November,
the final day of trading of
Abbey shares and the issu-
ance of new BSCH shares. It
should come as no surprise
that Abbey shares have been
the most active recently, with
40m of them changing hands
at the close of business last
Friday on the Dow Jones
industrial index.
Enron again
Three British bankers will
appeal against the decision
made by a judge at Bow
Street Magistrates court to
extradite them to the US to
face litigation on charges of
fraud and deception. David
Bermingham and two of his
colleagues will now await a
final decision by the British
Home Secretary. David
Blunkett’s decision will prob-
ably be based on whether
there is an actual need for
extradition, if their human
rights are being breached and
if there is a proper basis for
which the US can charge the
bankers. The stakes are very
high indeed for the bankers,
who face up to 30 years in jail,
a declaration of bankruptcy
and a fine of $1-2m.
Enron began life as an inno-
vative trader of gas, electric-
ity and other commodities,
with stock the most favoured
on Wall Street. Its problems
began in January 2002 when
former Enron executive
MaureenCastenadawasques-
tioned about the shredding
of various documents. The
SEC investigated and David
Duncan, chief Enron auditor,
pleaded guilty to obstruction
of justice with regards to the
documents shredded. Enron’s
subsequent collapse in 2001
left liabilities of about $80bn
and workers with nothing in
their retirement accounts
after the company filed for
bankruptcy.
In2002,AndersonConsulting
was prevented from perform-
ing auditing work despite
Joseph Berardino, CEO of
Arthur Anderson, explaining
the situation on NBC, and
thus suspended many thou-
sands of employees. Former
Enron vice chairman John
Clifford Baxter committed
suicide, and George Bush
called for tougher penalties
for corporate criminals and
a crackdown on boardroom
scandals.
The culture at Enron was
that of bright graduates being
given more than enough rope
to hang themselves and free
reign of how they managed
their business and clients.
What ensued was a group of
power-hungry, money-mak-
ing under-30s who felt ready
to take on the world. The
organisation was later found
to be full of corruption and
rife with false company state-
ments that claimed Enron to
have millions of non-existent
assets, such as a $250m gas
reserve and thousands of
megawatt hours.
And finally….
The EU has saturated its
membership and the addition
of proposed states, including
Turkey and Ukraine, will lead
to the eventual degradation of
governance, predicted Frits
Bolkestein, the EU’s internal
market commissioner.
After the recent addition of
10 new member states, bring-
ing the total to 25, the EU’s
goal of surpassing all the
world’s economies to be the
number one in 2010 seems to
be fading after every mem-
ber state’s addition, despite
Bolkestein’s continuous prod-
ding at European companies
to converge to best practices.
All change at Abbey: the multi-million pound bank is set to be taken over within two weeks
