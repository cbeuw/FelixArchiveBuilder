Hello, Snufkin here. As promised,
some tips for neophytes.
Most cryptic clues have two parts,
in which case at least one must be a
definition of the answer. If the other
part is simply a different definition
of the same answer, the clue is a
‘double definition’. For example, in
this puzzle, 6, 8, and 10 (and a few
more) are double definitions.
Another common clue is the ana-
gram, whose ‘subsidiary indication’
(non-definitional part) contains both
an anagram of the answer and a
phrase warning that an anagram is
involved. In this puzzle, clue 5 is an
example of an anagram.
Next time we’ll look at some more
complex clues. Snufkin
