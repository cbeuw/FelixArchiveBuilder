Christopher Reeve became an
instantly recognizable hero as
the invincible Superman. His
death last week, after years
of suffering from paralysis
caused by broken cervical
vertebrae (the vertebrae at
the very top of the spine),
has focused attention on the
possible cures for such an
ailment. Reeve himself was
an adamant campaigner for
research into such cures,
never losing hope of find-
ing the “miracle cure” that
doctors assured him did not
exist.
Towards the end of his life,
Reeve had become increas-
ingly interested in a form
of therapy involving human
stem cells. This field has
undergone rapid metamor-
phosis from being specula-
tive and fantastic into being
a very realistic and tangible
prospect; it is now promising
to deliver the ‘miracle cure’
Reeve had hoped for. Yet,
despite his hope, there are
still many potential pitfalls
associated with the therapy,
hidden snags that could yet
derail progress in this field.
A stem cell is an undiffer-
entiated cell that occurs in
the blastocyst, the human
embryo that is three to five
days old. The stem cell has
the potential to, when sub-
jected to certain conditions,
specialize into a specific type
of cell, such as a heart mus-
cle, red blood or nerve cell.
Embryonic stem cells are
obtained from surplus egg
cells that have undergone
in vitro fertilization, with the
consent of the parents. These
cells are then sub-cultured
to form embryonic stem cell
lines amounting to thousands
of cells. The concept is to
cause these cells to special-
ize by replicating certain con-
ditions, forming the desired
cells which are then trans-
planted into the body in the
area of damage. In the case of
Christopher Reeve, neurons
would have been cultured for
transplant into his spinal cord
in order to repair the dam-
age and allow him to fulfil his
dream of walking again.
This, however, is a still a
theoretical form of treatment.
The barriers that have pre-
vented further development
in this particular field are
numerous. Ethical problems
exist in that each embryo
that is taken apart to access
the stem cells themselves is,
arguably, still a developing
human being. What are its
rights? What if it has a soul?
These what-ifs, and many
more, have caused many
countries around the world to
ban stem cell research. The
cultured cells may also have
genetic abnormalities that
could manifest themselves in
the patient who receives the
cultured transplant.
Cancer may cause a prob-
lem, as may tissue rejection.
There are also license prob-
lems – gaining access to the
stem cells from the embryos
created by in vitro fertiliza-
tion is a long and costly pro-
cedure.
In response to these ethi-
cal concerns, it is often said
that the idealistic concepts of
what the embryo is, and what
rights it has, are preventing
the progress towards saving
the lives of millions of people
around the world who could
benefit from such reaserch.
Do we deny the needs of those
who suffer, and condemn
them to further suffering, by
upholding these idealistic
beliefs? We ask if we have
the right to access the cells of
embryos, but do we also have
the right to say to the millions
of Christopher Reeves in the
world: we cannot liberate you
from your condition because
the means by which we would
are reputedly unethical?
Yet before we lament the
ethical and medical draw-
backs of this research that
may prevent the full realiza-
tion of its potential, an alter-
native method has similarly
excited research scientists.
Until recently, it was widely
believed that human cells,
once specialized, are then
permanently so – they can-
not then be used to culture
other types of cells. This,
however, has been proved
false. If treated with certain
gene activators that occur in
the embryo, adult cells, for
example skin cells, can regain
their multipotency (ability to
grow into any type of human
cell); that is to say that they
revert to an embryonic condi-
tion that causes them to be
undifferentiated in a similar
way to embryonic stem cells.
Therefore, by the activation
of the desired genes (bear
in mind that every cell in
the body which possesses a
nucleus also possesses the
complete human genome, ie
a copy of every single gene in
the body), the adult cell can
be used to grow the desired
specialized cells needed for
treatment.
This form of treatment dra-
matically reduces the ethi-
cal and medical drawbacks
associated with embryonic
stem cell technology. Since
the adult cells would be taken
from the patient who needs
the cultured cells, the cells are
already ‘theirs’; they would
not be augmenting their own
body cells with those of anoth-
er. There is no risk of cancer
and no risk of tissue rejec-
tion. An undeveloped human
being is not being sacrificed
for their benefit. No ‘souls’
are being tampered with; no
complex licenses are needed
to access the stem cells as
they would be for accessing
embryos. The benefits are
countless: Parkinson’s dis-
ease, diabetes, heart disease,
vision and hearing difficulties,
as well as the traumatic spi-
nal cord injuries such as that
which affected Christopher
Reeve, can all be treated
using this form of therapy
without too great a leap of the
imagination.
It seems that medical
groups around the world
are on the brink of a major
breakthrough that can make
all this realistic. Reeve was
a dreamer; a Superman as
much before his death as
after. His bravery in the face
of inevitable and permanent
disability was heroic. Yet we
may be approaching an era
where the scope for such
bravery will be diminished, as
those who suffer from these
horrific ailments will be able
to access the resources which
will cure them.
Reeve was a pioneer in
campaign for the finding of
the ‘miracle cure’; it may be
that such a cure is not as dis-
tant as it may seem.

Death of Jacques Derrida and the hidden dangers of television
Jacques Derrida was reput-
edly the world’s greatest liv-
ing philosopher, but his death
ended up causing more con-
fusion than grief.
Many thought that the news
of Derrida’s death symbol-
ised something completely
different. Perhaps a hoax,
an attempt at post-modern
humour by the old man.
Derrida was the father of a
school of thought that became
very fashionable in the six-
ties and seventies, known
as ‘deconstructionism’. This
week, a whole host of web-
sites have popped up trying to
‘deconstruct’ the announce-
ment of his death in terms of
its actual social significance
and meaning.
Some deconstructionists
have concluded that Derrida
is not actually dead, but is
very much alive. In the sense
that his death symbolises a
form of rebirth into the new
social construct. According
to deconstructionist thinking,
every piece of text has multi-
ple or even infinitemeanings.
So ‘Jacques Derrida is dead’
can even mean ‘Jacques
Derrida is alive’, given the
right context. You also have
to remember that death itself,
according to some decon-
structionists, symbolises
certain culturally ingrained
prejudices against those who
can no longer breathe. Forget
Felix for a minute, even The
Times found it difficult to
write Derrida a fitting obitu-
ary:
“Can there be any certain-
ty in the death of Jacques
Derrida? The obituarists’
objective attempts to place
his life in a finite context are,
necessarily, subject to epis-
temic relativism, the idea that
all such scientific theories are
mere “narrations” or social
constructions”.
There was also a story this
week about the 20-year-old
Oregon student who owned a
Toshiba flat-screen TV that-
was accidentally emitting an
international distress signal.
This signal was picked up
by satellite and led to a res-
cue operation involving local
police and civil air patrol
centred around his flat in
Corvallis, Oregon.
This is very disconcert-
ing. You could be relaxing at
home watching a film and
suddenly have a crack com-
mando squad smash through
your windows, storming the
house looking for the HMS
Invincible. Hopefully, the
authorities in the UK have the
skills to distinguish between
a submarine distress signal
and the faint buzzing of a TV
monitor.
Could a TV monitor real-
ly emit a signal that would
be picked up, relayed and
interpreted by a satellite as
an SOS signal? Even if the
signal was at the right fre-
quency, what are the chances
that it would match an SOS
signal? I have my doubts
about this story, but the likes
of CNN and Reuters obvious-
ly do not.
