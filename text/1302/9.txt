October can be rather hectic,
trying to find time for your
studies while running around
to all the corporate presenta-
tions and recruitment fairs
and filling out those time-con-
suming application forms.
Although final year and
penultimate year students
are the targeted audience
for these presentations (and
certainly the big companies
usually only open internship
applications to these years),
allstudentsshouldtakeadvan-
tage of this annual merry-go-
round. It’s a good way to start
forming ideas about what
you might like to do when
the time comes to find a job.
Knowing what interests you is
a big help, as you can then set
about gaining the appropriate
work experience and develop-
ing the relevant skills so that,
come application time, you’re
a star candidate. Employers
will want examples of the situ-
ations from which you gained
such skills, so organising
extra-curricular activities is
vital.
The real value of company
presentations and recruit-
ment fairs is in meeting the
people and making contacts,
and thereby getting a better
feel for the organisation. You
should be able to find most of
the necessary information on
their website and by research-
ing the company and sector.
In general, not too much is
said at the presentations that
you won’t already know if
you’ve done the research.
Even if you won’t be apply-
ing this year, attending these
events can help you discover
what you want to do (or what
you definitely don’t want to do)
anditmayalsomakeyoumore
aware of how the recruitment
process works and the level
of competition. Big employers
hardly need advertise them-
selves and actually use pres-
entations and workshops as
a way to start finding poten-
tial recruits. They will often
take down the contact details
of students who have made
the right impression and may
even invite them to a smaller,
select gathering. So, if you’re
planning on applying, think
of some intelligent questions
(not already answered in
the brochure) and introduce
yourself.
It’s also useful to observe
the networking that goes on at
these events, what impresses
the company representa-
tives and what doesn’t. You
will often see them trying to
make a quick getaway from
the know-it-alls, the numb-
ingly boring types and the
clueless types who start with
‘well, I’m not really sure what
I want to do’. Try to ‘click’ with
them – at the end of the day,
they want to employ people
they get on with.
Unfortunately, the recruit-
ment events tend to lack
diversity and are dominated
by the large financial/busi-
ness institutions. For those
who don’t see themselves in
an office in the City, you may
have to step off campus and
take the fair elsewhere.
Hot on our heels, The
Times has brought out a
new Careers section (every
Thursday) which covers
pretty much everything in
bite-size pieces, one of which
last week was entitled ‘Be dis-
creet if your aim is to become
a spook’. MI5 is number 63
in The Times 2004 Top 100
Graduate Employers, so
there’s an idea if the thought
of PricewaterhouseCoopers
or Citigroup doesn’t really
do it for you. With phrases
such as ‘information gather-
ing’, ‘careful research’ and
‘interpreting data’ being
used to describe the work of
the secret service, Imperial
should be a recruitment hot-
bed for MI5!

Whether you’re embark-
ing on your initial research
in order to choose a career
or you’re ready to target a
specific company, graduate
recruitment exhibitions are
an excellent forum for meet-
ing your potential employer.
It’s hard enough for gradu-
ates to get on the first rung of
the recruitment ladder, and
there isn’t a better way to
make an impression than in
the flesh. I personally went
to this exhibition at Wembley,
and I advise all of you to go to
the next one. Whatever you
want to be, you’ll find a career
platform. There is something
for everyone, from finance,
science and consultancy to
languages, marketing and
sales. You can meet recruit-
ers face-to-face and get a feel-
ing of the company you are
interested in, plus lots more.
You can attend free career
seminars and company pres-
entations, or sit down with an
expert that will go through
your CV at the ‘CV clinic’.
There is also the opportunity
to attend interviews and hand
in your CV, if your career is
already clear to you. If you
wish to visit the CV clinic,
make sure you get there early
to avoid the massive queue!
After filling out a regis-
tration form, I first went to
GCHQ’s stand. Does the
name mean anything to you?
Well, before going to the
exhibition, I certainly didn’t
know about the Government
Communications Headquar-
ters. These days you hear a
lot about the British intelli-
gence agencies, but have you
ever thought of joining one?
‘Heard but not seen (until
now)’ is how GCHQ introduc-
es itself. GCHQ reports to the
Foreign Secretary and work
closely with the UK’s other
intelligence agencies (com-
monlyknownasMI5andMI6).
Their primary customers are
the Ministry of Defence, the
Foreign and Commonwealth
Office and law enforcement
authorities, but also a wide
range of other Government
departments.
What you are allowed to
know is that they work to
counter the numerous threats
that face the nation and
the global community. This
involves using cutting edge
technology to intercept com-
munications and electronic
emissions.
GCHQ has two missions:
signals intelligence (Sigint)
and information assurance.
Sigint work protects the
vital interests of the nation,
providing information to sup-
port the Government in for-
eign policy decisions, military
operations and law enforce-
ment.
Information assurance
helps keep Government com-
munication and information
systems safe from hackers
and other threats. The intel-
ligence they provide is at the
heart of the fights against ter-
rorism, international crime,
drug trafficking and weapons
of mass destruction.
I was interested to find
out their recruitment crite-
ria. Mandeep Kuner, GCHQ
technologist and mathemati-
cian, said: “We recruit from
a broad spectrum of disci-
plines, with a minimum of
a 2.1 degree. There are dif-
ferent positions such as lin-
guists, technologists, applied
researchers, intelligence ana-
lysts, finance specialists and
vetting officers, just to name
a few. Therefore, science, lan-
guage, engineering, IT and
accountancy degrees are all
welcomed”.
I wanted to know which
specific skills GCHQ seek
in an applicant – ‘analytical
skills’ seem to be a major
requirement. Work experi-
ence in any institution is a
bonus. After speaking with
Kuner, my impression was
that you must be exceptional
to succeed in the selection
process which includes appli-
cation forms, psychometric
tests, interviews and going to
an assessment centre. If any
of you are interested in such
a career, the website www.
gchq.gov.uk has all the neces-
sary information on how to
apply: www.gchq.gov.uk.
The next stop I made was
to ACNielsen BASES, a lead-
ing company in new product
consulting, providing sales
forecasts and market analy-
sis to companies around the
globe. Positions in this com-
pany again are not limited to
any specific degree area.
I approached Paula Wright,
the HR manager, who told
me: “The main requirements
we expect from an applicant
are very strong client serv-
ice ability with analytical and
multitask skills. We accept
graduates with a minimum of
a 2.1 degree but they must be
enthusiastic individuals with
the ambition to learn”.
She added: “We are very
disappointed with the stu-
dents we came across here
today. They want to know
from us what we can offer
them and what the company
is about. We ended up being
given hundreds of CVs, but
nobody impressed us particu-
larly. It doesn’t take much to
do a little research about us
and to come prepared. We
are looking for researchers
and they should at least know
how to do that. The best way
to impress us is to show some
interest and knowledge about
us, otherwise we will not con-
sider them further”.
The message is quite clear:
show the company that you
are very passionate and inter-
ested in them. There is no
way you will be selected above
hundreds of other applicants
if you do not make an effort.
