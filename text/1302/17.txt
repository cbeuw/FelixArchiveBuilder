CLUB REVIEW
Entering the car park of this famous
club is an experience in itself. The
gates are constructed entirely of
crushed cars piled on top of each
other, creating a breathtaking sight
for first time visitors. Muffled bass
can be heard seeping out of the
building as you make your way to
the entrance, filling you with antici-
pation and excitement. Be warned
though, chewing gum cannot be
taken inside due to one of the many
gash rules now bestowed onto mod-
ern clubbers, resulting in bad breath
for the duration of the night.
Godskitchen used to be classed
as one of the posh superclubs in the
UK, and in comparison to places
like Gatecrasher 1 (formerly The
Republic) in Sheffield and Cream at
Nation in Liverpool, it is. However,
comparing it now to new clubs
popping up around the country,
Godskitchen seems like a bit of a
hole to be honest. Still, I person-
ally love the place and it does hold a
touch of class above the rest.
Upon entry you have a bar to your
right and are faced with a series of
steps. One leads up to the second
and third rooms, the other down
to the main arena. The main room
is a large warehouse-like expanse,
with the DJ booth behind you as you
enter, raised slightly above the many
clubbers and podium dancers.
Seeing Carl Cox’s fat head behind
the decks brought a slight smile to
my face as he blasted out his own
distinct style of techno. You can tell
he’s been in the business for years,
and why he’s one of the best techni-
cal DJs in the world.
One thing you can always depend
on Coxy delivering is a crowd – the
whole club was packed and literally
hotter then the sun. This didn’t stop
the atmosphere being electric or the
masses of clubbers dancing almost
in unison, giving even first time
clubbers an overwhelming sense of
elation. Amazingly, everyone in the
club emitted a friendly aura with
everyone wanting to shake your
hand and be your part-time mate for
the night.
Venturing upstairs, you find an
‘oxygen bar’, or the ‘rip-off bar’ as I
like to call it. Personally, the thought
of paying £5 for five minutes of fla-
voured air is completely dokey, but
recommend it to anyone you don’t
like and just have the satisfaction of
watching them throw their money
down the proverbial drain!
Next to this is the second room,
which houses a completely differ-
ent type of music. James Zabelia
was playing progressive house and
later returned to play an awesome
breakbeat set. This room is a lot
smaller then the main one and you
can actually spit in the DJ’s face
while ordering yourself a beer at
the bar. Not advised, but worth a try
for kicks.
The sounds were bassy and
bouncy with monotonic vocals over
deep bass lines and electronic hic-
cups reverberating round the room.
Zabelia also scratches like a kid with
nits, adding new dimensions and
new sounds to his already breath-
taking mixing. An acquired musical
taste, but awesome if you appreci-
ate it.
The third room at Godskitchen
is the funky lounge. Situated at the
top of the club and hard to find for
the first time, the lounge can be
quite intimidating. Originally it was
the chill-out room for wrecked club-
bers that needed to get away for a
bit. Now it has turned into a haven
for the ‘pretty people’ in the club,
full of sexy gals and pretty boys,
whichever takes your fancy. As you
walk in you immediately notice a
line of them posing along the bar.
You know who I mean – ripped faded
jeans, funky tops and stylish hair.
Fag in one hand, drink in the other
and armed with a cheeky smile, they
occasionally break out into a spon-
taneous shuffle to the music, try-
ing to impress one of the gorgeous
girls dotted around the room (the
thrust and the wink is my personal
favourite).
The lounge has a plush carpet
and comfy seats with huge square
tables, ideal for chilling and chatting.
Funky beats are blasted out at toler-
able levels, so chit chat is possible
but you still get the feel of being in
a club. The atmosphere can be pre-
tentious on first impression, but is
actually friendly. You soon find that
you can easily walk up to someone
and strike up a conversation about
nothing. Alternatively, you can just
strut up and dance with a group of
know-yas (randoms) without getting
looked at like a complete weirdo.
If you’re looking to sit and observe
some of the best looking specimens
of our species, the lounge is an ideal
place to do so.
Basically Godskitchen has a lit-
tle something for everyone, apart
from R’n’B, but come on, a bit of
change will do you guys some good.
Whether you’re a die-hard clubber
out for a good time or a pretentious
poser, this club has something for
you. It’s well worth the trip out of
London for something a little bit
different.

CLUB REVIEW
Before I start, I should give you
an idea of how this article is going
to pan out. Two weeks ago, Simon
reviewed Knowwhere and made
various comments about the qual-
ity of the music and DJs. To say I
was horrified doesn’t do justice to
the set of emotions I went through
as my eyes grew wider and my jaw
moved slowly towards the floor, cul-
minating in the spraying of my drink
across the table as the shock of two
stars just threw me over the edge.
Knowwhere (KW) has been one
of my favourite events, if not my
favourite, since I started going there
about 18 months ago, and I couldn’t
believe that everybody else didn’t
feel the same. Everyone I know that
has been adores the place, and the
regular, familiar crowd attest to the
fact that it really does do it for many,
many people. Of course, there are
going to be differences in taste, but
for me and my friends that’s only
half the story, the other half being
made up firmly of the people, atmos-
phere and overall vibe of the place,
which in my experience are almost
unparallelled in London. Because
of this, I decided I had to review
the next Knowwhere night, to try
to convince you all that it’s worth
every penny.
Originally, KW was held in the
Soundshaft, a 600 capacity club near
Charing Cross, and this was part of
what made the event so special. The
intimacy was astonishing and made
the whole thing feel like a glori-
fied private party which, we decided,
was “fucking wicked!”
When we heard that KW was mov-
ing to the Fridge, we were excited
but also cautious. The Fridge is an
awesome club, but would the atmos-
phere transfer to a venue with over
twice the capacity? The first time
we went we couldn’t believe how
well the move had gone – the famil-
iar faces were all still around, but
so were loads of new ones and the
feel of the original KW was still
there in spades. The fact that it
was their third birthday meant that
extra effort had been made, with the
main room decked out in a suitably
party-spirited way. The usual stalls
were there by the bar area selling
T-shirts, CDs and things that glow in
the dark, and loads of extra seating
had been put in by the entrance. The
bar area itself was extremely disco
with hundreds of small glitter balls
littering the low ceiling, glowing red
and blue through the perspex sur-
faces.
The opportunities the second
room offers have been seized upon,
and it was full every time I went
in. This was especially so for the
back to back set by Shaun Rowland
and Dom Pardey, whose enthusi-
asm behind the decks was wonder-
ful to watch, mainly because they
are regular crack-on buddies and
so share a rapport rarely seen these
days. The set was full of techy, funky
house with masses of groove that
the crowd just lapped up like a cat
on the cream.
As I was strutting my funky stuff,
my friend commented that this was
the way clubbing was heading –
towards funky, beat driven house,
similar to the kind of material you
can find on early Trade CDs – and I
would be inclined to agree. It’s cool,
enjoyable music to spend an evening
with and fantastic for people-watch-
ing. However, my heart still belongs
to trance. It was trance I had come
for and it was trance I was going to
have.
One thing I should make clear at
this point: KW do not do cutting edge,
intelligent, forward-thinking trance.
They are not pushing the genre for-
ward into the future; I wouldn’t even
say they do the same kind of trance
Gatecrasher used to do. No, what
KW do better than anybody else
is bouncy trance that makes you
want to jump around like a rabbit
with a head full of poppers, grinning
like a post-orgasmic Cheshire cat. If
you want to stand around all night
pondering the complexities of the
mix the DJ is in the middle of, or
discussing why Tiesto, Van Dyk and
Armand are shit and nowhere near
as good as the Armenian producer
you discovered while you were chat-
ting about your new drum sequenc-
er on trancebores.com, then piss off.
Or more specifically, don’t bother
coming here – you won’t like it.
KW is for people who want to have
a bit of a laugh, catch up with old
friends, make new ones, have a bit
of a bounce around and leave in the
morning smiling and feeling their
lives are just that little bit better for
having been there. This is achieved
with the help of a great bunch of
DJs and a music policy that suits me
down to the ground.
When we rolled up at midnight,
the main room was already buzzing
and Steve Morley was just about
to step up. Steve was followed by
Lizzie Curious (my first time, and
I was impressed), Anthony Dean
(all hail the mini DJ), Pablo (pro-
moter/legend), Ian Betts (Imperial
graduate/top bloke/awesome DJ)
and Matt Darey (nuff said).
For those who weren’t here last
year or missed my incessant rav-
ings in Felix, Ian Betts is absolutely
massive in London and one of the
best, most loved trance DJs cur-
rently doing the rounds. He’s grown
in stature over the last few years
having played for Cream in Ibiza,
toured Australia and been installed
as Heat’s second ever resident. He’s
on the way right to the top. He
knows exactly what and when to
give to the crowd and he is adored
for it. Needless to say, tonight he
was excellent and as usual his own
Love Resurrection blew the roof off.
This production has been tearing up
dance floors across London for over
18 months and is finally set for a
release in the next few weeks. I urge
you to go out and get a copy as soon
as you can.
Finishing off the night in style,
Matt Darey came along with his
typical brand of driving, melodic and
uplifting trance. He was also the
source of a few surprises in terms
of track choices, playing Silence and
an absolutely epic version of Dreams
that seemed to go on forever to give
the night a perfect ending.
The tune of the night, just edging
Love Resurrection into second, has
to be For An Angel. Unbelievably,
I’d never heard this in a club and it
sounded amazing. It certainly got
the biggest response of the night
and had every single person stand-
ing with their arms in the air and
heads held back.
Overall then, another fantastic
night out at KW for me. As usual,
the people were spot on, the atmos-
phere was there in bucketloads and
the music was perfect. Granted, it’s
not for everyone, some may find it
a bit cheesy and simple, but those
people would be missing the point
altogether. After all, it’s about hav-
ing fun, and I know of nowhere that
has an overall package that is as
much fun as Knowwhere. Do your-
self a favour next month, and get a
bit of trance in your life.
