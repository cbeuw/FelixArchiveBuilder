Queen Mary Men’s 1st 0
Imperial Men’s 1st 2
By Michael Berks
Imperial Firsts opened their
2004 campaign with a tough
BUSA South-Eastern fixture.
The team faced an away trip
to the side that forced them
into second place in last sea-
son’s London league: reign-
ing ULU champions Queen
Mary.
Imperial will face the
Chislehurst outfit three times
this season, so today was the
chance not just to gain some
revenge for last season, but
also an opportunity to gain
an important psychological
advantage for the rest of the
year.
As Imperial went through
their warm-up exercises, the
skies darkened, and by the
time kick-off arrived the light
drizzle had evolved into a full-
scale downpour. The pouring
rain, coupled with the pros-
pect of facing one of London’s
most notoriously tempestu-
ous sides, meant today would
be a baptism of fire for the
new faces in the Imperial
ranks. Passion and commit-
ment would be the orders of
the day.
As expected, the early
stages of the game were
frenetic, with neither side
managing to hold onto pos-
session, and time on the
ball was a scant commod-
ity. Unfortunately, Imperial’s
remodelled 3-5-2 formation
wasn’t quite gelling. In par-
ticular, the midfield three
– debutant Louis join-
ing old-timers Berksie and
McMahon – were failing to
make their numerical advan-
tage count, allowing Queen
Mary to dominate most of the
early play. However, fresher
Pat Farr was already mak-
ing a big impression, and
alongside Paul “the Club”
Mills, and Tom “G-Unit”
Gray, the Imperial back three
responded to everything that
was thrown at them. When
Mary’s did manage to breach
this blue and black fortress,
Carlos Alberto Vasquez made
light of the “keeper’s night-
mare” conditions and dealt
with every shot or cross with
his usual unflappable author-
ity.
Despite their disjointed
start, Imperial were prepared
to battle hard, and gradu-
ally clawed their way back
into the game. One attacking
foray down the right flank
forced a throw-in deep in
the QM half. As the ball was
thrown long, Oli used his con-
siderable bulk (all 87 kilos of
it) to great effect, his flick-
on running through to “so-
good-they-named-him-twice”
Benji-Benji. The ball rico-
cheted between a defender
and the Spanish youngster,
eventually running loose to
the edge of the box and into
the path of Imperial trick-
ster Mathan. The Sri Lankan
wizard’s intelligent first time
side-foot fooled both defend-
ers and goalkeeper alike,
squeezing inside the near
post to put Imperial one up.
To compliment his excellent
finish, Mathan made full use
of the slippery conditions,
celebrating in exuberant
Klinsmann style: 1-0.
Moments later, Matty was
almost on the scoresheet
again, however this time he
nearly provided Queen Mary
with an equaliser. As the ball
fizzed across the Imperial
area, Mathan’s miscued
clearance flew alarmingly
quickly towards the wrong-
footed Carlos’ goal. Luckily,
the Peruvian cat recovered
his footing in time to stick
out a leg and divert the ball
for a corner, sparing the
blushes of Mathan. This was
the last meaningful incident
in a first half that offered lit-
tle to the neutral observer,
though Imperial were more
than happy to enter the break
ahead.
In the second half, the
weather failed to improve.
Sadly, neither did the quality
of play – sexy football this was
not! However, with three vital
points up for grabs, Imperial
were prepared to fight tooth
and nail to preserve their
lead. Through sheer force
of will, the men from South
Kensington began to domi-
nate.
In response, Queen Mary
lost their discipline, and hav-
ing scythed Oli down in the
first half, QM’s captain dived
in on Benji. This earned the
Mary’s number four a yellow
card, and Imperial a danger-
ous free kick in the perfect
position for Louis’ cultured
left foot. Worse was to follow
for the mullet-bearing centre
back, and as Louis curled the
ball over the wall, he seemed
confident the ball was sailing
over the bar, calling to his
men: “All day, all day...”
Unfortunately for Mary’s,
the only thing worse than
his judgement was Tom G’s
tie collection, and as the ball
careered off the crossbar, the
QM defence stood stationary.
This left Oli and Joe to fight
over the rebound, the captain
screaming loudest to head
past the hapless QM keeper:
2-0. This second goal would
surely secure the game for
Imperial, and the elation was
there for all to see on the
faces of Oli and his troops.
With the game now seem-
ingly beyond them, Queen
Mary switched their atten-
tion from scoring goals to
kicking lumps out of the
Imperial team. In particu-
lar, the Mary’s number eight
proved that Robbie Savage
might not be the most irritat-
ing footballer on the planet.
However, Imperial were not
prepared to rise to this bait,
instead concentrating on
holding out for a clean sheet
and deserved three points.
Amidst the deluge, the ref-
eree finally brought proceed-
ings to a close. Despite the
pouring skies, Imperial’s joy
wouldnotbedampened.Along
with a winning start, Imperial
had much to celebrate, with
promising debuts for Benji,
Louis and Chris (a second
half substitute for the ever-
reliable Timur). However, no
one had a better game than
“man-of-the-match-on-his-
debut-and-birthday” Pat, who
was a rock in the Imperial
defence for the whole ninety
minutes.
This may just be the start of
a long season, but then even
the longest journey begins
with the first step. Great
things await...
