Given that it’s DreamWorks’ answer
to Finding Nemo, I had high hopes
for Shark Tale. With an impressive
cast, the movie was bound to be a
success at the box office – the likes
of Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese
and Renée Zellweger attract the
more mature moviegoer, whereas
Will Smith, Angelina Jolie, Jack
Black, Missy Elliot and Christina
Aguilera are sure to spark the
interests of a younger generation.
However, Shark Tale tries too hard
to please everyone, and the result
is a mildly amusing cartoon that
has none of Nemo’s charm. The few
funny moments in the film come
from references to Jaws and gang-
ster films, which are sure to be lost
on much of the younger audience.
The film is disappointing visually.
Main character Oscar’s world is
a sprawling submarine American
metropolis,completewithbillboards,
sushi restaurants and prawn shops.
The fish live in a brand-driven world
in which they drink Coral-Cola, eat
Kelpy Kremes and communicate
with shellfones. The main charac-
ters all have a visual likeness to their
Hollywood voiceovers: the shark
mob boss has De Niro’s mole, Sykes
has Scorsese’s bushy eyebrows, and
Oscar has Smith’s big lips.
As movies go, Shark Tale is about
as unoriginal as they come. As a
camp, cross-dressing shark, Lenny
is the only imaginative character.
Finding Nemo had a simple plot
– a father’s desperate journey to
find his son. Shark Tale is a whole
lot more complicated. There is the
love triangle that is Oscar, Lola and
Angie. There are Oscar’s dreams
of making it big and his adventures
as a shark slayer. Finally, Lenny’s
trouble at “coming out” to his father
about his culinary (read sexual)
preference is yet another subplot in
this cluttered film.
Shark Tale simply doesn’t come
together and relies on a loud, extrav-
agant ending to leave the audience
feeling satisfied.

Wimbledon courting
Wimbledon is the scene for this
good old-fashioned love story. Even
if you are not a tennis fan, the film
is worth watching, as the tennis
doesn’t dominate. The plot follows
Peter Colt (Paul Bettany, Master
and Commander) as the lucky
British wild card to the Wimbledon
tournament. His game is slipping,
his back failing, his spirit dying. His
rank has slipped form 11 to 119. Colt
has major problems with his game
and at home. He knows his time is
up as a pro on the tennis courts and
has already accepted a job help-
ing the more senior citizens with
their swings at a health club. This is
his last Wimbledon. Every romantic
comedy needs a hopeless lost soul
that has given up on love, and Peter
Colt is it.
Cue the romantic interest,
America’s new talent Lizzie
Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst,
Spiderman 2), the John McEnroe
of women’s tennis. She’s the bitch
on the court – tough, focused and
determined. Nothing will stop her
from winning this Wimbledon, espe-
cially men. Her father (Sam Neill)
will make sure of that. Still, the phe-
nomenal Lizzie cannot help but fall
for Peter’s charms, but how can she
handle a relationship and a career?
Somehow Peter manages to work
his way through the tournament; his
dream of winning one of the most
prestigious tennis tournaments is
near realisation. Lizzie is Peter’s
salvation.
Paul Bettany is the perfect char-
acter for the role. You love him, you
want him to win, you’re sitting on
the edge of your chair for the cliff-
hanger ending, biting your nails.
You want him to get the girl, and you
probably already know the answer
to whether he does or not, but that
doesn’t matter in the end when you
walk out of the cinema and feel
uplifted and generally contented
from this heart-warming film.
Dunst also adds her usual affabili-
ty to the role. Peter’s amicable char-
acter is synonymous with the role
of a struggling British tennis player,
thereby making the audience will
him on, both in the matches and in
his moments with Lizzie. He is the
transformed hero of Wimbledon.
There’s tension and suspense, and
it’s just like watching Tim Henman
again. Can Peter cope with the oner-
ous burden of national expectation?
Wimbledon is given authentic-
ity through real commentators,
such as John McEnroe and Chris
Evert. It even captures the sporting
drama of narrow escapes and tense
finals. This film will appeal to all
those Henmaniacs, however sitting
through it has all the predictability
of one of Henman’s semi-finals.
Wimbledon is a light-hearted and
clever film. Nothing beats Notting
Hill for a romantic comedy, but this
comes a close second.

As a short U film, lasting only 90
minutes, Shark Tale can be enjoyed
by all ages. Produced by the same
makers as Shrek and Shrek 2
(DreamWorks), this film is very
similar in style to its predecessors,
incorporating jokes that although
intended for the whole family may
be more fully appreciated by a more
adult audience. There are also many
references to other films such as
Jaws and The Godfather, which are
most likely to be recognised by older
viewers.
With an enjoyable, lively, largely
hip-hop soundtrack, the film is set
in the animated underwater equiva-
lent of New York. Based more from a
human perspective than an aquatic
one, scenes include many clever
fishy puns and plays on words such
as Kelpy Kremes and Coral Cola.
If, like me, you love everything
about Will Smith, especially as the
Fresh Prince of Bel Air, you will
also love his character as computer
generated fish Oscar. Oscar works
as a whale washer determined to
make something of himself through
wealth, fame and respect from the
other fish. There is a large amount
of brilliant voiceover casting in this
film from actors sharing similar on-
screen personalities and appearanc-
es to their fish counterparts.
The film seems to be strongly
inspired by other animated block-
busters such as Finding Nemo, and
there are similarities between the
two sets of characters.
Although it may lack originality,
Shark Tale is very enjoyable and
light-hearted. Not only does it have
a really witty and clever script with
the classic happy ending, it can still
be followed even after a hardcore
week of freshers activities with no
sleep!
