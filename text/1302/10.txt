Competitions
Win... a dance mat!
Yes indeed, this week we’re giving away a dance mat (compatible with
PS1 and PS2 consoles), which works in conjunction with the famous
dance mat game. Please don’t ask us why. Anyway, it looks quite im-
pressive, and I’m sure a few of you will be into that sort of thing...
For the chance to win, just answer this question:
What type of dancing was demonstrated by the Imperial
Dance Club in dBs on the Thursday of Freshers Week?
a) Salsa dancing
b) Break dancing
c) Morris dancing
Email your answer to felix@ic.ac.uk by Thursday 28 October. The first
person to be randomly selected after the closing date will win the prize.
Felix competition rules apply.
