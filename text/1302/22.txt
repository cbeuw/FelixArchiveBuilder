Brunel Women Too many
IC Virgins Not enough
By Harriet Tennent
The team started the year in
true Virgin style: down the
union, slightly inebriated, on
a Wednesday night.
The fight club boxing ring
was much appreciated, with
Trev (tiny back) pinning down
captain Felix (6’2” forward),
and Killer continuing her
unbeaten reign by thoroughly
thrashing yours truly. Pinkie
may be out of action on the
pitch, but on the true battle-
field (the Union dance floor)
she continues to score!
Oh God, I might have to
mention the match now. Do
I have to?
Well, the Virgins started
badly when only 11 players
turned up, but after a quick
trip to a sports shop on the
way, re-arrangement of boots
and borrowing of kit (boots,
socks, shorts...) from coach
Dave, there was a team of 12.
After the fuss of arranging
this friendly, we were damn
well playing a rugby match,
so Brunel very generously
lent us three of their players.
After a very hasty discussion,
we put their flanker at fly
half and our winger (me!) at
scrum half and started the
match.
Highlights included for-
ward of the match Hayley sit-
ting on their prop’s face and
being surprised as “most peo-
ple like it”. This was clearly
unacceptable. But the prop
was obviously listening, as
she went on to sit on Beater
twice. Newbie Tumbles (back
of the match) played a stel-
lar game and put Nathan’s
tackling advice to very good
use, mullering many a way-
ward Brunel player. Beater
bonded with Dapps about
their common Welsh-Belgian
sexiness and commend-
ably held up the second row.
Pip exhibited the totally
mad-for-it attitude that
made her an awesome prop.
Ali put in far too many
fantastic tackles to be put
on the wing and had to be
moved into the centre.
The same can be said for
Danger Mouse who showed
her try-hungry colours by yell-
ing for the ball all the time.
So in the end, as you can tell,
the Virgins were all utterly
stupendous but Brunel some-
how managed to win (they
are in the league above).
Many thanks must go to
our guest coaches on Monday,
Jen for coming and watching
in the wet and cold and to our
super duper driver and water
monkey Ed, who must now be
questioning his wisdom dat-
ing a Virgin after standing in
the pouring rain all afternoon
and enduring the chorus that
echoed round Southside and
the Union Bar: “Hail to the
bus driver!”
If you are interested in play-
ing women’s rugby, getting
fit, making friends and sing-
ing loudly after a few pints,
we would love to hear from
you. No previous experience
is necessary, and all shapes
and sizes can play. Please

By Mike Hicks
The First XV started their
first match of the season with
a team almost unchanged
from last year. Having not
lost at Harlington for the
previous two seasons, we
came out strong if not a lit-
tle rusty.
Shortly after kick-off, a
careless penalty close to
our 22 gave Chichester the
chance to open the scoring
with a penalty. Being three
points down woke up the
Imperial team and we started
playing some good rugby.
A great break by O’Rourke
on the halfway line was fol-
lowed by even better support
and finished up with a four
on one against the fullback.
Robinson duly touched down
to open the Imperial scoring.
Shortly after the restart, a
bit too much French flair led
to Spencer throwing a hor-
rendous miss pass in front of
the IC posts. The opposition
centre had seen this com-
ing from about last week and
intercepted to score under
the posts and make it 10-5 to
the visitors.
Chichester were now back
in the match but Imperial
raised their game again and
Spencer went in for a try
in the corner to level the
scores.
In the second half we
started to play a bit more
consistently, but more
unnecessary penalties gave
Chichester the chance to
score another six points.
Luckily, Higgins had other
ideas and with a man of the
match, hat-trick avoiding, full
back trampling performance,
he scored two tries to secure
this season’s first league
win for the Imperial College
Union Rugby Club.
Notable performances
came from debut freshers
Simon and Luke and also
from O’Rourke with some
superb strength on the wing.
Although Wednesday’s
performance was scrappy
at times, if we continue to
improve and cut out the pen-
alties and dodgy miss passes
then this year should be
another very successful sea-
son for Imperial rugby.

Imperial Men’s 3rd 69
Queen Mary 0
By Mike Hicks
The Third XV, Imperial’s most
sociable rugby team, started
their season with a crushing
victory.
From the start of the game,
the opposition defence was
almost non-existent and
there were gaps all over the
pitch. This meant the power-
ful Imperial attack was virtu-
ally unchallenged as they ran
in try after try.
Boosted by a powerful
bench of over 40 freshers
to choose from, the Thirds
dominated from start to fin-
ish. Man of the match went to
captain Dan “Peanut Head”
Lindsley for his leadership
and also a sublime left-footed
drop goal from the halfway
line!
Hopefully next week’s
opposition will provide more
of a challenge to the power-
ful force that is the Imperial
Third team.
Medicals triumph
over Imperial
Seconds
Imperial Men’s 2nd 17
Imperial Medicals
Men’s 2nd 23
By Mike Hicks
For the first match of the sea-
son, Imperial’s Second XV
rolled into Harlington to face
the newly promoted Medics,
with LSE seconds having quit
the league at the last minute!
With a healthy contingent
of old and new players alike,
Imperial faced up to the med-
ics knowing that it would be a
hard fought match. An early
score came from a kicked
medic penalty after some
nervous early play (0-3).
The Imperial team came
straight back at the medics
and after some dominating
scrummaging were rewarded
with a penalty inside the
opposition 22. Two quick for-
ward moves later and Steve
McClell crashed over for a
debut fresher try (5-3).
Undeterred, the medics
quickly applied pressure and
scored under the posts, giv-
ing them an easy conversion
(5-10). The Newmanator then
hit back with a devastating
try to level the scores (10-10).
Some lax defending then
gifted the medics a try out
wide (10-15). Refusing to
give in, the mighty Imperial
Seconds fought scrum after
scrum in their own 22, before
finallyreleasingAlexNewman
for his second try of the game,
taking the lead (17-15) with
the help of a superb conver-
sion from Tom Hodgson.
With five minutes to go, the
medics hit back with a try and
a penalty in swift succession,
leaving the Imperial Seconds
with a desperate last play to
try to capture an elusive win-
ning try. This was not to be,
and the match ended 17-23.
Despite the last minute
loss, the Imperial seconds
remain optimistic, eight
freshers started the game
and all acquitted themselves
well. The development of the
side has only just begun, but
a successful season certainly
beckons!
