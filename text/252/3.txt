IC GLIDING CLUB
I.C. Gliding Club, founded in
or around 1931, is the second
oldest in the country and can
claim to have been in the forefront
of British gliding ever since.
Flying takes place at the Lasham
Gliding Centre in Hants, where
over one-sixth of all British glid-
ing is carried out.
Back in the early days, the
club'sfirstglider was built in the
Mech Eng Department, and was
tentatively flown anywhere and
everywhere there was room to
take off, have a quick fly and
land, notably on the playing
fields of I.C.
At that time they were affili-
ated to the London Gliding Club,
which was a few years their
senior, but after the war the Lon-
don club were unwilling to let
them back into the fold except
at an exorbitant cost, and so
they moved to fly with the Surrey
Gliding Club at Redhill, follow-
ing them to Lasham in 1951.
Precarious Training
Before two-seat trainers were
invented, learning to fly was an
extremely precarious business.
The trainee was strapped firmly
into the single-seater and towed
slowly across the airfield while
he tried to keep the wings bal-
anced. When he accomplished
this to the satisfaction of his in-
structor, he was towed across the
airfield again, this time making
short hops all the while, then
long hops, then even longer hops
until, if both he and the air-
craft was still in one piece, he
was finally allowed to complete
a whole circuit of the airfield.
This method of training was in-
efficient, to say the least, so in
1949 the College bought a Slings-
by T-21 two-seater trainer and
this, in the hands of the organ-
isation at Redhill, helped to
formulate all of the two-seater
training methods now in exist-
ence. This same machine, now
in the hands of the Lasham Air
Scouts, and officially named
"Daisy," has now made the ri-
diculous figure of nearly 70,000
flights.
Two Gliders
I.C.G.C. currently owns two
high performance gliders; and
Eagle two-seater trainer and a
solo sailplane, the Skylark 4.
The I.C. club is one of the few
clubs in the country that puts
its two pilots on to the high per-
formance Skylark almost as soon
as they've gone solo, instead of
making them gradually progress
on to more and more expensive
machines.
Recently, the Skylark was lent
to the British Gliding Associa-
t e 141 S k j M 4
fight
tion in order to further a plan
called Operation Sigm aiming
to produce the best glider in the
world, so that Britain will win the
the 1970 World Gliding Cham-
pioniships. The B.C.A., in turn,
lent it back to the College Aero
Department, who, under the
guidance of Mr. Frank Irving,
warden of Beit Hall, covered it
with all sorts of weird instrumen-
tation in order to develop new
ailerons.
Members on BGA
Mr. Irving has in fact, been
connected with the club almost
since its inception, has been a
member of the Technical Com-
mittee of the B.G.A. for 12 years
and is' a consultant to the Slings-
by Sailplane Company, this
country's only glider firm, for
whom he " Does the odd sum
now and again." He is also a
co-holder of the British National
two-seater distance record, hav-
ingflown250 miles from Lasham
to Lourain, in Belgium, there
being no record of how he got
the glider back.
Gliding Club members have
been active in British Gliding
ior many years. Apart from
Frank Irving, Mr. Paul Minton,
warden of Garden Hall, sits on
the Accident Committee of the
B.G.A., while Bill Bailey, a Civil
Eng. P.O., represents the Lasham
Gliding Centre on the B.G.A.
council. The club also ran the
radio for the British and Irish
teams in the 1965 world cham-
pionships at South Cerney in
Gloucester, while Frank Irving
has been on the British Ground
Crew since 1952. George Burton,
as a result of finishing in the top
three in this year's nationals at
Lasham, has been selected to fly
for Britain in the 1968 world
championships in Poland. And,
slightly further down the scale,
Dave West, the club treasurer,
gained 3rd place in the Southern
Region of the Wills competition
for novice, glider pilots, winning
an expensive barograph for the
club.
Internationalists
Quotes of the Fortnight
Patrick Wall MP at IC recently :
" English-born coloured immigrants."
Malcolm Duckett at R.C.S. debate " Because of the lack of
women at I.C., look what I've ended up marrying."
Jeannie Prickett, at R.C.S. debate; on the situation of girls at I.C.
" Too many men—not enough opportunities for women."
Mr. ICWA—I'm not here for stud purposes alone.
Martin Lack—I don't want MY union beaten up.
Editor—Unlike the Sundays, Felix wants to be an informed news-
paper.
CAR PARKING P L A C E S

As well as helping the British
teams, the club lent their Sky-
lark to the Finns, at South
Cerney in 1965, who promtly
showed their gratitude by smash-
ing it up. They explained in
fluent Scandinavian and not-so-
fluent English that it was " one
of those . . . English stone
ledges." However, just to prove
that anything the Finns can do
we can do better, a nameless I.C.
flyer flew the newly-repaired ma-
chine backwards into a hoarding
on the club's subsequent visit to
the Alps.
Summer visits to the continent
are a feature of the club's acti-
vities, last year visiting Angers in
France, where the townspeople
named their gliding festival " Les
huit jours d'Anger," perhaps an
estimate of I.C.G.C.'s ability.
Gliding Weekends
From a social point of view
I.C. visits to Lasham are every
bit as enjoyable as the gliding
activities. Mike Neal, an ex-
president of I.C. Union, owns a
cottage near the airfield, where
the club members frequently re-
pair to imbibe vast quantities of
his potent home-made wine, and
fly off their hangovers in the
morning.
The pleasure of gliding is the
constant struggle to maintain or
gain height, to utilise the energy
stored in the atmosphere in
the form of thermals, turbulent
bubbles of warm, rising air, or
air currents rising over a hill and
the waves of air formed behind
a hill just as a stone forms ripples
in a stream. Then, as well, there's
pleasure in standing around for
hours in Wellington boots and
steady rain, with the cloudbase at
a hundred feet, and in being
towed into the air by a thor-
oughly clapped ' American Ford
pick-up to experience the feeling
of weightlessness as the launch
ends and the cable drops away.
But it's comforting to know
that the glider can withstand
more than 3Jg. before it's liable
to fall apart, unless its gets flown
upside down, when the wings
may have a slight tendency to
drop off. And it's even more
comforting to know that one of
those magnificent I.C. men in his
gliding machine knocked 3ft. off
a wing-tip during an argument
with a tree, and flew on quite
safely without noticing the loss.
ICWA Party
Last Tuesday, 14th November,
Imperial College was bestrewn
with slightly inebriated, if not
downright drunken, women. Yes

Girls Visits
Alarmed at the fact that the
intake of girls to RCS was only
eighty this year, the union meet-
ing last Tuesday decided to invite
a number of girls to visit the col-
lege, in order to persuade them
to spend a happy three years
here.
If vou think this is a good idea,
try these facts for size. To get
into the main RCS denirtment
vou must get two erade B's or
better. Assuming 15 ner cent of
all girls get these irmrks, iu*t *r>
have a chance of inviting the eirls
that wo'ild <"Tn? heri* * » « * " *
would have to invite about 500.
Being modest we'll aim for an in-
crease of 30 per cent, and assum-
ing we manage to persuade two-
thirds of the invited girls to stay
we must bring 1,000 girls, or
about thirty coach loads. At 5s.
for food on board this makes
£250 and 100 guides, a very diffi-
cult assignment to carry out.
Kaleidoscope
Anyway, changing from Politics
to Entertainments, are you doing
anything on Friday? Well forget
it, and come to " Kaleidoscope,"
the RCS Carnival. This is by far
the best social event of the year
and goes on from 9.00 p.m. to
6.30 a.m. and at only 30s. double
it is really very good value,
tickets available at lunch times
in Southside and the Union, or
from your year reps.
Kaleidoscope means " kalos "
or " beautiful" and "eidos,"
"forms," thus "beautiful forms,"
so there is no need to worry
about the theme, just come
dressed in anything or nothing, as
long as it is coloured.
Carol Singing
After Kaleidoscope you should
just have recovered in time to
go carol singing on Monday 4th
and Wednesday 6th. RCS and
the Royal College of Music have
joined forces for this event. If
you. have been carol singing be-
fore, forget it; this happening is
completely different so you're
bound to have a good time, and
we should collect £500 plus for
the I.C. Carnival Charity.
Chat with President)
On the subject of the President,
Bob says that he will be at home
in Tizard 422 every lunch time
("dinner hour" for Mike Tait
and all sons of the working class),
and will be pleased to see anyone
who likes to come along with
comments or complaints, or just
Simply for a cup of coffee. If you
aren't free at dinner time give him
a ring on internal 3634 (yes, he's
got a private phone) any evening.
Finally, congratulations to Pete
Dolwin for becoming Physics'
department Rep.

Carnival
Collections
The big news in Guilds at the
moment is the fantastic record-
breaking Carnival collection! One
Thursday Lunchtime about 100
Guildsmen (and Guildswomen)
well groomed and well disci-
plined, set out for the Oxford St.
area, where, by some coincidence,
a red veteran car was catching the
" admiring" glances of several
" men in blue." In just over an
hour the public were relieved of
over £270—surely the most effi-
cient Carnival collection ever.
Well done Guildsmen! The only
problem facing Carnival Co-ordi-
nator Chris Palmer is how to re-
trieve one Leukaemia collecting
tin from Cannon Row police
station!
Ford Cup
On Sunday the Ford Cup for
Guilds Rugger Sevens was even-
tually won by Civil 2. In the final,
which was played in semi-dark-
ness at best, they beat a strong
O.C. team for the trophy, which
Civil 1 won last year. Much
credit is due to Terry Stephenson
and Dick James who organised
the event so successfully.
Coming Events
Coming events in Guilds—De-
cember 5th is the next Union
meeting and December 8th is
Carnival carol singing night. So
watch the Guilds notice boanls
for details.
Finally, Dick James has set a
target of £1000 to be collected by
Guilds for Carnival by Christmas
—and with £350 already in the
bag it should be possible.
So -rally round Guildsmen—
let's have £1,000 by Christmas!
happened. ICWarians and their
guests (invited and uninvited)
were enticed to the I.C.W.A.
lounge by the promise of free
sherry and punch which only ran
out just before 7.30 when half of
those present went to dinner. For
those ardent drinkers who were
wHIipst to seek out the wine
waiter, the drink was to be had in
profusion, and as some found to
their cost the punch was more po-
tent than it seemed.
This Annual occasion rooted
out many ICWarians who do not
usually honour I.C.W.A. func-
tions with their presence. It
seemed a pity though that
ICWarians would not { bring
guests. There was a surplus of
women, naturally, very nice for
those men invited, but the con-
versation is lacking if groups of
women stand about gossiping.
Carnival
Last week Battersea, Chelsea
and diverse training colleges held
their rag, and of course they had
lots of women to help raise money.
They even, as lots of London rags
do, sent women to Southside to
con money out of us! Well in our
carnival this year we must follow
suit. Whenever collections are to
be taken, please, Icwarians,
volunteer. Rich business men
with lots of money are more
likely to part with it to a pretty
face than to a lot of rowdy yobos.
Anyway it's great fun asking
people for money (in the name of
charity), so please help in this
year's carnival.
