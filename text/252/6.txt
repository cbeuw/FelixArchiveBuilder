The United Kingdom Atomic
Eneregy Authority, established
in 1964, has rapidly become one
of the familiar features of the
present day industrial scene in
Britain, one which is having an
ever-increasing impact on the
national economy.
Within the Authority are some
three thousand graduate or pro-
fessional scientists and engineers
engaged on the civil research and
development programme alone.
There is a much larger number
of industrial workers. Technical
^support staff bring the total
strength to thirty-five thousand.
There is plant, machinery and
equipment of almost every kind
known to nuclear work, includ-
ing the largest computer service
in Europe.
A U T O N O M O U S G R O U P S
The Authority is organised in
relatively autonomous groups-
Research, Weapons, Reactor,
Production and Engineering.
There are often no hard and fast
bundaries between the fields of
operation of different groups.
Research is carried out in
many different fields, from Nu-
clear Physics to Health Physics
and Medicine. Within the Re-
search Group, the Atomic
Energy Research Establishment
at Harwell does some applied re-
search, but by far the greater
part of its research work is basic
research: some pure research is
also undertaken.

Most of the research is done
by the Research and Weapons
Groups. It is aimed at supply-
ing the background of scientific
knowledge needs for develop-
ment and appraisal of new re-
actor systems.
The Weapons Group is in.
:
volved with the research and de-
velopment of weapons and the
extension of these into the civil
field. The equipment, facilities
and experience are now used ex-
tensively in many fields other
than that of weapons. The
Group's computing centre at
Aldermaston has probably the
most powerful complex in the
country.
The Reactor Group is respon-
sible for most of the Authority's
design and development work on
nuclear reactors. The Authority
has two Power producing re-
actors and twenty research and
experimental reactors in opera-
tion.
R E A C T O R S
The Production Group is re-
sponsible for the actual operation
of the Authority's Power Re-
actors, the manufacture and sale
of fuel elements at home and
overseas, and the subsequent re-
processing of irradiated elements.
It includes Engineering, Techni-
cal, Chemical Services and
Health, Physics and Safety De-
partments.
E N G I N E E R S
The Engineering Group is re-
spponsible for the design and de-
velopment of chemical plans and
fuel manufacturing plants, and
electrical and instrument design
and supply and inspection ser-
vices for the whole Authority.
Lastly, the Health and Safety
Branch study Reactor Safety,
Criticality, Radiation Dosimetry.
Fallout, Aquatic Radiobiology
and Chelating Agents, chemical
means of removing radioactivity
from the body.
SCIENTISTS
There are opportunities for
Physicists, Chemists, Chemical.
Mechanical, Electrical and Civil
Engineers, Mathematical and
Metallurgists.
C A R E E R S
There are four main categories
into which graduates are re-
cruited : Scientific Officer Class,
Experimental Officer Class, Pro-
fessional Classes and Graduate
Apprentice.
A good honours degree is re-
quired for entry as a Scientific
Officer. These staff initiate,
direct and evaluate research.
Salaries start at about £1.000 and
rise to aboit £2,300—£3,000 and
higher for those who rise beyond
Principal Scientific Officers.
The Experimental Officer
Class, who need a pass degree (or
H.N.C.), have a starting salary
-of £800—£1,690. and prospects
of £2.000—£3,000 plus. Their
function is to carry out most of
the experimental work of the
Authority.
The work of scientists and en-
gineers in the Professional
Classes covers a range of activi-
ties including the design, con-
struction, operation, performance
evaluation and development of
the Authority's chemical and en-
gineering plant, reactors and
other facilities. Any necessary
management training is given.
Starting salary is from £1,000—
£1,200, with prospects of about
£2,700—£3,300.
Graduate Apprenticeships last
up to two years. These are for
newly qualified engineering grad-
uates, and are designed to pro-
duce fully competent engineers in
their particular fields.

A wide range of careers for men and women taking
RESEARCH or HONOURS DEGREES in 1966 is
available in the Establishment of the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority.
There are posts for Graduates with PASS or
ORDINARY DEGREES.
VACATION STUDENTSHIPS are awarded at most
establishments to Undergraduates (normally those in
the penultimate year) seeking appropriate experience.
