IC Win Swimming
Championship at ULU
I.C. swimming teams scored a great success in the U.L. swimming
championships last Wednesday evening. They beat the nearest chal-
lenger, University College, by 2 points in a closely fought contest
(55—53).
The meeting began with the 440 yds. freestyle which Ray Harris
won by over a length to set a new championship record of 4m. 51.1s.,
bettering the old record by 1 sec. His other two wins came in the
110 yds. butterfly and the 110 yds. freestyle in which Steve Howarth
finished 5th.
Keith Davies comfortably won the 220 yds. breaststroke in 2m.
58 sees, with Roger Guy placed 6th and Jeff Hook, the team captain,
was iust beaten into 3rd place (73.7 sees) in the 110 yds. backstroke.
John Badmin was 2nd in the diving and at the end of the indi-
vidual events. I.C. were 4 points ahead of U.C.
The medlev souad of Hook.
Davies, Harris and Chris Collier
had a great swim to beat U.C. in
the relay, which meant that the
freestyle squad of Davies, Tony
Maycock, Collier and Harris had
to gain at least 3 rd place for the
team to have an overall victory.
This they did in a race which
was won by the strong U.C.
squad. The team is to be con-
gratulated on their fine all-round
performance, particularly Ray
Harris on his superb swimming to
win 3 titles.
Squash
The first team has now begun
to recover from its customary
bout of defeats at the start of the
season. Recent results are a
loss to North London Polytech-
nic after a hard match, followed
by wins against Guys Hospital
and Kings College. Another
match was won by forfeit, bring-
ing the accumulative results to :
lost 3, won 3.
The glorious team is the sec-
onds which has defeated all op-
ponents so far in the League (six
matches). The members of this
illustrious band have become
brave enough to challenge the
firsts to a match.
League rules allow staff players,
any I.C. staff are very welcome to
Join the Squash club and try for
team places. It would be par-
ticularly useful to have more
girls .available for competition
matches.
Cross Country
At the London College's league
on Wednesday. I.C. had some
bad luck when Norman Morrison
had to drop out due to a sprained
ankle, and had to be content with
second place to Borough Road.
Nick Barton, running very well
recently, won the race and was
well supported by the rest of the
I.C. team.
Tragic loss
for
Soccer 1st XI
L.S.E. 2 : I.C. 1
I.C. l«t lost their second game
of the season against L.S.E. last
Wednesday by 2 goals to 1. They
were unfortunate as this was one
of their best performances of the
season, I.C., being in complete
command for 80 per cent of the
game ; but somehow goals did not
come. They were leading 1-0,
after a goal by Whittle, but with
only 15 minutes left to play
L.S.E. got two breakaway goals
completely against the run of
play. This only put revengeful
determination into the I.C. side
and tremendous pressure was put
on the L.S.E. defence for the last
five minutes; but unfortunately
the result stood.
To round off the day in typi-
cally inconsistent I.C. fashion,
I.C. VPs lost 6—3 against L.S.E.
IV and the VII team beat L.S.E.
Ill 4—2. The second team went
to the top of the divisions with a
good 5—1 defeat of Q.M.C. and
remain unbeaten* in league
matches this season. l.C. Fourth
team beat Q.M.C. IV (for their
first defeat this season) by 4 goals
to nil.
1st XV Walk Their
1st Round Match
GUTTERIDGE CUP 1st ROUND. l.C. 41—WOOLWICH POLY 3
After good wins against Streatham Scorpions and C.E.M. I.C.
1st XI were in a fairly confident mood for their 1st round match
against Woolwich Polytechnic whose rugby prowess was a little of
an unknown quantity. Woolwich arrived late which upset I.C. and
they showed this by going out and playing hard straight from the
whistle—a little unusual for I.C. Woolwich seemed to be holding
out quite well but after a few minutes some slack tackling let Pine
in for a try. I.C. then got comfortably on top scoring three more
tries in the 1st half, the score being 16-0 at half time.
In the second half I.C. were This try spree would not of
slow to get into top gear but after course have been possible but for
about ten minutes the T.C. backs
made excellent use of a good
ball from the forwards and
started to run in the tries. Mar-
shall as usual was in sparkling
form making a number of clean
breaks either to run on and get
the try himself or to pass on to
his equally try hungry centres
Kelly and Ballard. Unfortunately
these three had the game so
sewn up in the centre that Rog
Chappell and Mike Riley had
rather a lean day.
Hockey Club
On Wednesday, 8th November,
the 1st XI played against Pem-
broke College on their ground in
Oxford. It was a cold, foggy day
and the weather must have in-
spired the play for the game was
dull and unimaginative. There
was no score on either side.
Saturday, 11th November, was
an equally bleak day for the 1st
XI. Their fixture against Sussex
University 1st XI was cancelled
due to the opposition's club offi-
cials not wishing to miss a party
at Brighton that evening. How-
ever the 2nd XI played the Sussex
University 2nd XI which had
been strengthened by a few mem-
bers of the first XI) at Harlington
and lost 5—1. The 3rd XI played
Brunei 2nd XI and won 6—0 and
the 4th XI lost 1—0 to Hendon
4th XI.
The 4th XI game that week
was marred by a shortage of I.C.
players and it would make life
much easier for club officials if
members would tick off the avail-
abilityjjst well in advance and the
published team lists by Tuesday
so that adjustments can be made
in order to field full sides.
On Wednesday, 15th Novem-
ber, the 1st XI played their first
U.L. Cup game against Westfield
College and won 10—1. On
Saturday, 18th November, the
club had a block fixture against
Staines. The 1st XI lost 3—0,
and the 4th XI drew 2—2.
the dominance of the I.C. for-
wards. The jumping of Tony
Duke and John Lum in the line-
out was completely effective and
their share in the scrum was un-
matched, dive Swinnerton was
in good form with the boot, kick-
ing six conversions, some from
near the touch line.
We now look forward to play-
ing at Wye College in the quarter-
finals on January 25th and hope
that they are not quite as good
as the other farmers at present
touring the country.
Guilds Sevens
Guilds 7-a-side nigger is now
riefinitelv established as one of
the mos* civilised and enjoyable
" sport" events of the year.
Led by Dick James, Guilds'
loveable vice-president. 133 as-
sorteJ players made their way to
Harlinr'ion on Sunday 19th Nov.
to play in a knock-out competi-
tion, the games of which varied
from the " sanguine to the ridicu-
lous."
For the more serious player
the final rounds proved to be
hard fought games with the first
of three Civil 2 teams beating the
Old Centralian team in the final,
(the p'.aycrs tell me this, too, was
a tough game; pity it was dark, it
might have been good to watch).
The Mech. Eng. 3 team won the
losers' cup and one of two P.G.
teams got to the third round,
having only two byes on the way.

U L U Cup
Win
Ladies of I.C.W.A. 9 Westfield 0
The ladies of I.C.W.A. enter-
tained Westfield at Harlington on
November 8th in the 1st round of
the U.L.U. cup. We showed
Westfield how to score 9 goals in
rapid succession; mainly thanks
to our U.L. left inner who scored
5. The defence were never hard
pressed and at times all 22 players
were in Westfield's half.
The next round of the cup is
the day after R.C.S. Carnival so
please do not keep I.C.W.A.
hockey players up all night. Sup-
porters required.
Mixed Hockey
Guinness 0. I.C. 1
A merry contented I.C. Mixed
Hockey XI returned from
Guinness brewery last Sunday
week; merry due to the convivial
evening and contented with their
win.
The win was due mainly to
team work although the goal
came from a good solo run by our
centre-half. The tactics of our
backs, the female one chatting to
the male forward inevitably
caught him off-side so by full-time
Guinness admitted that we were,
obviously old hands at the game
and this we proved conclusively
as the free Guinness and Lager
were passed around.
