QEC. SMEAR OfeAlGN.
On the night of Thursday 23rd of November, a reading party from QEC. broke into the
Union and painted "Keep the Home Fires Burning" across the wall of the lower refectory.
When contacted last Saturday, Susan ?(i,istead, secretary of QEC. Union denied a l l
knowledge of the raid, but the circumstantial evidence against them is overwhelming.
Last year "(JSC. Rag" mysteriously appeared in the same place, and last Friday morning,
the pillar box on the .'"b-ar.-t Hall side of the Union was painted white and "QEC Rag"
scrawled on the pavement beside it. The additional fact that "Keep the Home Fires
Burning" is QEC's motto must clinch their guilt.
More surprising s t i l l is that yesterday, Tuesday 28th, 5days after the happening,
Mr, Jock Henry, College security Officer, stated that he did not know that the raid
had occure^.. This can only sreve to illustrate the poor state of Union Security, which
was revealed in the last issue of FELIX. QEC. must now be hoping to make this an
annual event and, unless something is done about security, it is hard to see how they

FALMOUTH LOSES MOTHER TELEVISION SET "
A few weeks ago, as reported in FELIX, the television was stolen from Falmouth Hall
gallery. It had been on hire from Radio Rentals, who replaced it without difficulty. This
new set was stolen last Thursday night.
After the first theft, Falmouth Hall Committee had discussed Security, deciding that,
the security of the gallery depends on improved security of the whole building,
possibly involving taking on extra staff. Such decisions take time. At one time there
was a. fair amount of minor thieving from Southside, which was cut down by the install-
ation of doors on the external stairs.
Presumably it will not now be easy to get another replacement set, Sub Warden Peter
Hills states: "for the sake of everybody's property in these Halls, security on
entrances to the buildings must be improved".
Naturally Mr, Hills will be pleased to hear from anyone who saw anything on Thursday
