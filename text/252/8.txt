9 Youth work
It is a new idea and takes a little getting used to; one is told
on the best authority that social work involves much commitment,
but this need not always be the case. O.S.S. exists io remove the
many subsidiary difficulties which prevent students doing serial work
It enables them to grapple dir?ctlv with the real problems without
having to face the minor difficulties which individuals would find
extremely discouraging, if not insurmountable.
O.S.S. was set up in 1965. by I.C. students, specifically to assM
all students wanting to do social work regardless of their motivation
By design O.S.S. is not a club or a society and has no political,
religious, humanist or other doctrinaire policies—indjed these are
considered to be out of the terms of reference of O.S.S. There is no
membership and people are not asked to do things FOR O.S.S. but to
make USE of the services it provides. In view of this novel structure
modifications were made in S.C.C. standing orders to enable it to
function within the structure of the union.
Basically, there are three main groups of activity with many
other smaller or transitory undertakings. It is difficult to keep close
track of what is happening as the situation is moving so fast.
Work Parties
Work parties, the largest group,
will always have the widest ap-
peal because they can be run on
a "casual labour" basis.
Through numerous contacts
O.S.S. obtains jobs of a varied
nature for almost every weekend
of the session and students are
asked to come along only when
they wish and to stay only as long
as is convenient for them. By
knowing approximate numbers a
continuous work force can be
ensured although the individual
members frequently change.
Many I.C. students like some
form of physical work with ham-
mer and nail, shovel and saw,
paint and brush. They find the
work strenuous but a welcome
change from the academic rigours
of a University course. Some jobs,
like the decorating tasks for the
Notting Hill Housing Trust for
task force arc relatively civilised,
others have ended up under flood-
light and rain manhandling lumps
of 12 in. x 12 in. x 15 ft. wood
through mud and debris.
O.S.S. at present makes tape
recordings of text books for many
blind students to provide them
with vocal technical information.
This supersedes the former ar-
rangement of reading to blind stu-
dents in person as it is both more
productive and easier.
O.S.S. established facilities
within the college for the record-
ing of required sections of litera-
ture and possesses a tape-recorder
reserved solely for this purpose.
It is always accessible to students
wishing to make recordings whe-
ther it be for a few minutes in a
lunch-hour or a whole evening.
Sections of " Gray's Anatomy "
and an " O " level Geography
book are at present being re-
corded.
SoUtade if yon like on a decoratioa work
The attitudes of deprivation ac-
cepted as part of daily life by a
typical club member of the adven-
ture playground youth club can
be an eye-opener to the average
informed student and a useful
foot on the ground. No particular
skills are required but whatever
talents you have are very likely
to be quickly exploited.
A more serious and long term
aim of the " Adventure play-
ground," underlying all the hila-
rity, is thefittingof the individual
for society primarily by providing
facilities of which many are de-
prived and, secondly, by encourag-
ing a sense of communal responsi-
bility. Opportunities exist at a
number of clubs for a wide range
of activities; from toddler mind-
ing, through the energetic trials of
playing with the 5-12 year olds in
an adventure playground, to the
more demanding youth work with
teenagers. Also, people are re-
quired to be bingo-callers, tea-
makers, pianists, listeners, give
lifts to old-folks, look after pets,
and so on in a never ending list.
Some of the youth clubs we
help are the organised type whilst
others accept the rejects and pre-
sent a tough challenge in keeping
order amidst the necessary "Non-
Organisation."
Other Activities
A group of students is engaged
on the regular visiting of old folks.
Opportunities arise for students
to support charitable organisa-
tions by distributing leaflets, col-
lecting money, etc. O.S.S. does
its best to inform students about
these opportunities and, if there
is sufficient support, organises the
necessary facilities.
The regular college blood-
doning sessions are promoted by
O.S.S. and a considerable amount
of work is involved here.
But is it'childproof?
Structures for the adventure
playground
A new I.C. emergency blood-
doning unit is being set up and
operated by O.S.S. aimed particu-
larly ai hall residents, it is hoped
that as many as possible will
transfer to this scheme.
The next task is to form an
O.S.S. emergency mobile labour
unit to deal with the emergencies
which periodically arise in certain
areas of London—jobs like mov-
ing an evicted family off the
street.
U.C. and Q.E.C. both have
students doing similar work and
London seems to be leading the
way in this type of work organised
solely by students.
London University is now at-
tempting to set up a council for
social services and it is hoped
that this will come into operation
next session. Much could be
achieved by the inter-college co-
operations which it will foster.
O.S.S. basically exists to get
things done—The talking is left
to others. If you want tofindout
whether you would enjoy social
work come along and find out.
But be warned—most people who
take up social work don't want to
stop.
