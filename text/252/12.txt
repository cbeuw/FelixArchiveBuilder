"J SCRUTINY DIES
the issue of Scrutiny which' appeared last week vdll be the last.
The Huxley (Humanists) Society was founded in 1957 after an enthusiastic Touchstone
Weekend. Two years later the Society produced a Broadsheet, the then Editor writing:
"T shall be. delighted to have letters or articles from anyone who feels stimlated to
produce them, so that if the response is sufficient another issue of Scrutiny may be
produced." Apparently the response was sufficient and so Scrutiny was launched. Two years
later it was taken over by the Social Clubs Committee and expanded as a general magazine,
appearing termly. "Writers have always included members of staff and officers of the Union-
as well as members and associates of S.C.C.
However, Scrutiny never sold above 800, and since' it began to be professionally
printed^ in 1963> i t always needed about twenty pounds subsidy per issue, lately there lias
been no enthusiastic band willing to produce the magazine, the last two issues being
edited by chairmen of S.C.C. This term's issue was made up of material intended for last
term's, which did not appear. An S.C.C. motion to wind up Scrutiny was passed last term.
STUDENT LIFE
FELIX Advertising Agents have recently published the first issue of a new student
newspaper which is to appear four times a year. Printed in colour, "Student Life" is
professionally produced and edited by an ex-editor of "Redbrick", the student newspaper of
Birmingham University.
The publishers, Educational Publicity, say that the purpose of the paper is twofold-
firstly to give a student orientated paper of national status but with no political
affiliations, and secondly to attract "careers advertising" away from the nationals to the
student press.
NEnTHEMK
Newthink, the 1st issue of which appeared last week is produced by a group of people
from several universities who fel-b there was a need for a magazine "to encourage an active
attitude among young people -and promote discussion of problems at their roots." The
printing, by offset litho, was done in Wolverhampton, the money (£60) being put up mainly
by the three editors. If they sell out they vdll make £15 which will go towards the next
issue. 1000 were printed, of which 120 were sold in IC. The Editors realise that the
present issue, although the first, is not of high production standard and consequently
they will get a new printer for the next issue. Contributions should be sent to 621 Tizard
or to the Newthink address by fst Jan,
QUOTE from the Institute of Physics November Bulletin, about the preparation of papers
for publication: "Etymologically unsound nomenclature, ambiguities, technical- jargon and
colloquial language should be avoided."
