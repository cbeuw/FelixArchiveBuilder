FELIX 9
King's put their case
KINGS
Now I never want to de ac-
cused of saying that such a thing
as a grand debating contest, I.C.
v King's College London, does
not hold a very real interest for
a large number of I.C. students,
and don't let it be said that Felix
isn't one of the few places in the
college that really knows what's
going on. It's just that it's a dull
week when your intrepid Felix
reporter sets off towards Strand
underground, forking out non-
refundable expenses to report on
the debate.
To start from the beginning, it
was sometime last Thursday that
your intrepid reporter made his
way up to the third floor of the
Union building to see what excit-
ing and dangerous assignment
would tax his rather limited
talents for this issue.
On entering the press-room I
was met by clouds of cheap
cigarette smoke from the Felix
fags, and after clearing away
about a dozen empty beer-mugs,
a few ink-cans, and an ash-tray
full of 9d. biros I sat down on top
of a typewriter.

I looked round among the
coughing figures who get their
names in big type in the credits
of each issue (I don't want to be
features editor, anyway), and
asked if there was anything they
wanted me to cover, but it ap-
peared my work hadn't* been too
loudly applauded lately, and they
were almost on the point of mak-
ing me buy my own film for the
Felix camera. But after I threa-
tened to use another few hundred
yards of Felix film on more or
less useless shots of the type I
WIN
DEBATE
had been taking for the first half
of the term, I was eventually
assigned to cover the grand de-
bating contest mentioned above.
I arrived at King's College only
1J hours after the debate had
begun (not bud for Felix), or if
you care to put it another way, 15
minutes before the debate ended.
Nevertheless the report was com-
pleted, thanks to the efforts of the
secretary of the Debating Society.
Debate
It appears that the I.C. debat-
ing team met at King's College
for the first round of the U L U
debating competition. We were
opposing the motion. "This house
believes that this is the best of all
worlds," This was defined by
King's as meaning that our world
is better than any there has been
in the past, but they specifically
excluded the future, an interpre-
tation of the motion with which
we did not agree.
Their claims that the world is
more human was tested to the
limit by our team, brilliantly led
by D. Bennet. who poinfKS out
that never before had there been
so much famine in the world.
Unfortunately King's team, led
by Mr. Massen, put their case in
a very lucid, if somewhat verbose
stvle, and in this kind of compe-
tition, unlike Union debates, it
is not what is said, but the way it
is said that counts. Because of
this the three judges, one from
each of T C . K.C.L. and U.L.U.,
had no choice but to let King's
College through to the next
round. So much for our past
glories, and a great pity that two
such good teams had to meet at
such an early stage in the compe-
tition.
SEX AT
S I L W O O D
As notices around, the college
will tell you Touchstone stands
for values. The values discussed
a fortnight ago by about twenty
people at the I.C. field station at
Silwood Park were " Sex Prob-
lems and Solutions" ; the discus-
sion was led by Dr. W. Green-
cross, a leading gynaecologist.
She opened her lecture, which
was particularly informal, by
suggesting that a good alternative
title could have been " The per-
missive society," and she indi-
cated the problems that arise as
a result. Her lecture then be-
came a controlled dialogue with
the audience. She quoted facts
and figures, explaining that one
in six children born in London
is " illegitimate" and then out-
lined the social problems that
such children encounter, particu-
larly the social stigma that be-
comes attached.
The group then broke into dis-
cussion on our attitudes toward
pre-marital sex and generally it
was agreed that a mature rela-
tionship needed care and respon-
sibility. The question of contra-
ceptive advice in schools was dis-
cussed. Dr. Greenwood showed
that in practice many marriages
were lacking in communication,
and the idea of increasing the age
of marriage was proposed, but it
was generally agreed that further
restrictions were On personal
liberties and must be avoided
although many marriages are far
from satisfactory.
The success of the weekend
was indicated by the reluctance
of the audience to end the discus-
sions and ran over the set time
by one and a half hours—finally
the weekend was summarised
Dr. Greenwood.
End of
Psychedelia
The Secretary of Ents. Mike
Smith, resigned a fortnight ago
because of pressure of work.
There was no personality clash
between him and chairman Keith
Guy, as has been rumoured. It
was just that the work was too
demanding on his time. The new
secretary is Gordon Sage, who
had only recently been appointed
asst. secretary to take some of
the burden off the retiring secre-
tary.
G R E E N ON
A V A N T - G A R D E
Benny Green, jazz critic for
the Observer, delivered his second
lecture this term fat his usual
fast moving, witty style. He was
applauded as he entered the lec-
ture theatre, and he was ap-
plauded as he sat down after a
lull sixty minutes of jazz, jazz
talk, and more jazz jokes.
Sims
Everything seemed as normal,
this being the seventh lecture
Green has given at I.C. in the last
two years. I say " seemed as
normal" because one could dis-
cern evidence to corroborate
David Illingworth's comment in
the current issue of " Jazz Jour-
nal", where talking about Green's
programme notes for the jazz
Expo '67 concerts, he says " . . .
his (Green's) columns of conde-
scension on the avant-garde—
which we all know he hates ! Or
are the winds of change blow-
ing?" I failed to detect a wind
but there was certainly a breeze
apparent on Tuesday, for Green
described Zoot Sims' multi-track
recordings as " musically worth-
while " and even went as far as
playing an example of Sims'
work. Last year he wouldn't have
dreamed of including that sort of
jazz alongside Ellington, Herman
and Getz.
Parker
Certainly Sims is not avant-
garde but he is of a later vintage
than Charlie Parker, that cele-
brated saxophonist whose re-
cordings Mr. Green previously
seemed to consider the end of the
jazz era.
Perhaps Mr. Green has talked
himself into a corner and is now,
finding that there is something to
be said for contemporary jazz,
slowly trying to extricate himself.
The first avant-garde recordings
must have seemed like the ram-
blings of idiots, a big confidence
trick, and would have been easy
to dismiss as such, but as moi»
and more well known jazz musi-
cians have taken up this form
(Coltrane was the best example)
it becomes increasingly difficult to
put it down so glibly.
What will be really interesting
is the final lecture in two weeks
time when Mr. Green promises to
bring along some examples of
avant-garde for what he described
as a " frank discussion "; perhaps
we should issue a gale warning
for Mech. Eng.
D O W N - U N D E R FOLK
Last Wednesday, 22nd Novem-
ber. Folk Club featured as their
guest artist Trevor Lucas, who
comes from Australia. He has
been in this country for three
years, and sine - a variety of folk-
songs, including of course many
from Australia. He is unfortu-
nately giving U D professional folk-
singing at Christmas to join a pop
group!
He sani a variety of songs from
all over the world, the majority
of which had not been heard at
Folk Club before, which was a
refreshing chgnjre. He rlispellpH
the rumour that " The black veP!
vet band " is Irish; it is in fact
Australian. He also sang a calyp-
so-style song from the Carribean,
" Joshua gone Barbados," which
made an unusual change. An
English song, "The mole-catcher,"
went down well with the audi-
ence, as did a song about a dog,
and a tucker box five miles from
Gundergee.
As usual the guest was well
supported by College performers.
They were of the usual high,
standard but it was a pity that the
first hour was spoiled by people
arriving late. The next Folk
Club is on December 6th,
featuring the "Young Tradition."
They have appeared at Folk Club
before and also at the folk c

At the third meeting of the IC
2000 Group the speaker was Lord
Ritchie-Calder, on "The Prob-
lems of Technology in 2000
A.D."
He began his speech by empha-
sizing the tremendous speed with
which Technology has advanced
in the last 60 years. 100 years
elapsed between the idea of the
aeroplane and the first aeroplane
leaving the ground but it was only
six years after the discovery of
uranium that we had the nuclear
bomb.
Lord Ritchie-Calder was very
sceptical about the ultimate value
of space research, saying that it
was turning the brains of techno-
logy away from the problems of
the world.
The competing nations spend
eight billion dollars a year on
space research in the hope of get-
ting a man on the moon'by 1970.
He then turned to B:
ochemical
Research. After what happened
with the " Bomb " he was full of
foreboding. Work is going on at
a fantastic rate in the "defence
laboratories " preparing for bio-
logical warfare v d manv Vople
are winnin" Nobel Prizes in this
He thought that the orob-
(ern<! of 2 000 A D were
going to be technological but
social and philosophical. After
Cuba there would never be a
nuclear war by act of policy, but
there could be one by a techno-
logical mistake.
Two of the greatest problems in
2,000 A.D. were going to be
population-growth and food. For
this, he had two suggestions. One
was the domestication of sea ani-
mals and the setting up c$ sea
farms, the other was the devel-
ment of single-cell proteins.
We have not had any philo-
sopher to study the implications
of scientific research since Bert-
rand Russell, and he is 93. The
trouble is that no-one can call the
scientists' bluff because science is
so socialised. Each group of
specialists is going ahead along its
own road, and there is no-one
who can see all the roads at once.
R A C E R E L A T I O N S
The second teach-in organised
by the Political Societies Council
(in conjunction with the Inter-
national Relations Club) heard
Patrick Wall, Jocelyn Barrow (of
CARD) and John Lyttle talk on
race relations. It was gratifying
to see that we are humanitarians
for there was attendance of ap-
proximately 80 at this meeting.
First, to give a few facts
gleaned on this informative even-
ing : there are now about one
million coloured people on this
island. Half of these come from
the West Indies, and of the others,
the sub-continentals predominate,
most having come in the late
fifties and early sixties. Of the
natives of this country, 10 per
cent are said to favour immigra-
tion from the Commonwealth, 20
per cent are against and 70 per
cent just don't know.
Mrs. Barrow seemed bitter
about the fact that to convince
the populus of this country of the
existence of a large amount of
discrimination, a huge sum of
money had to be spent in produc-
ing the P.E.P. report when the
same results, produced by C A R D
two years ago went unheeded.
Mr. Wall was very happy that
the two major parties were agreed
on (i) the necessity to limit the
number of immigrants, and (ii) to
see that in the future " British-
born coloured immigrants " re-
ceived equal treatment. We could
not afford to have fourth class
citizens.
