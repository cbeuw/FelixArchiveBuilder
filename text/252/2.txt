LUBBOCK ON SCENE
NON MASCOT RAID
OF THE YEAR
Eric Lubbock, Liberal M.P,
for Orpington, spoke on " The
Political Scene" in a General
Studies Lecture on the 14th Nov.
ind discussed all aspects of poli-
ces except the one which was to
eap into the headlines the follow-
ng weekend—Devaluation of the

ound.
Nationalism
In a thirty minute speech, he
:overed, the recent upsurge of
Scottish and Welsh Nationalism,
:he future of the coalmining in-
dustry, the duty of an M.P.,' and
vhat he called the widespread im-
patience in the country
On the question of
growing disillusionment with the
Wilson administration, " as
Jeremy said " there were central
problems of injustice and poverty
which had hardly been touched
and the general sense of frustra-
tion and resentment with the
Labour party stemmed mainly
from this. As a result people
were turning to the Nationalist
movement to express their criti-
cisms and even though it was
probably too early to understand
the true-significance of the swing
to the Nationalist parties, they
were a force to be reckoned with
at the next General Election. Of
course, the Labour government
could possibly recoup some of its
support in the next three years,
but it would be a " rash man who
would venture to predict anything
happening on the kaleidoscope of
the political scene."
Quite predictably, he ended his
speech by saying he believed
Liberal policies were the answer
to this country's troubles.
Thefloorwas then thrown open
to questions which once more
covered nearly all the points of
interest in politics at the moment.
Talking about the effectiveness of
the House of Commons, Mr.
Lubbock put forward a widely
held view amongst M.P.'s: if
you've got to stay all night to
vote, you might as well make a
speech, even if you don't know
anything about the subject. It

helps to show your constituents
that you're actually doing some-
thing. This, he said, was why
too much argument in the House
was on principles, and why he
thought most of the specialist
policies should be discussed in
a Select Committee of people
acquainted with the specific prob-
lem under review.
L o a n s
On two subjects of special in-
terest to the student, Mr. Lub-
bock came out against the idea
of student loans and for there to
be a lower differential between
initial and final salaries for
scientists and engineers in this
country, the temptation to emi-
grate is sUongest at the beginning
of a man's career, and a higher
initial salary could well persuade
him to stay.
Finally on the future bf the
Liberal Party he declared that he
tries never to think about this,
but would be quite happy to wait
till the election after next before
becoming a minister in a Liberal
government.
Nos da with
Dramsoc
If ever a play were written with
IC in mind " Under Milk Wood "
was it. The Dramatic Society's
production brings out every
bawdy joke, every innuendo,
every implied leer in Thomas's
script. Yet staging this "play
for voices " means an inevitable
loss for, as in all of Dylan
Thomas's work, every word
eounts and the staging and actors
are a distraction. The two narra-
tors are a major problem but by
reacting with the populace they
become part of the play, though
the First Voice appears to in-
trude. In order to portray all the
sixty-odd parts, each actor plays
several parts and identifies with
each by his clothing. He also
implies his own surroundings. I
found it confusing to accommo-
date two different, imaginary en-
vironments on the stage at once
and then to switch to two others.
The set design, with its many
creaking entrances, rather lets
down the actors who give an
hilariously brilliant rendering of
Thomas's' diurnal Welsh village
life. And not all in anglicised
Welsh, thank God!

" A Kings raiding party is ap-
proaching I.C." The warning
broadcast over the public address
system had the desired effect.
IC Union went to defensive posi-
tions ready to repel the intru-
ders. The gates were closed,
hosepipes and roofs were
manned, all that was missing was
the attacking party.
The chain of cause and effect
is highly complex ; Kings having
finally regained their concrete
lion mascot (Reggie) lost him
again while in the process of exe-
cuting repairs. On Thursday
morning, King's claim to have
had a 'phone call from an un-
identified source stating that
Reggie was here and there would
be a ransom of 100 pints of

quest of Martin Lack, Deputy
President of IC Union, distribu-

the Southside shop could be im-
proved. At present few residents
of Southside use the shop very
much, even though it is right on
their doorstep, mainly, it seems,
because the prices are higher than
elsewhere and the stock is too
limited. When interviewed, Mrs.
Abranams, manageress of the
shop, who had not been consulted
about the questionnaire—hardly
very courteous, Mr. Assimakis—
expressed surprise that people
were dissatisfied with the running
of the shop.

November, a message was pub-
lished alerting "P.S." agents to
await " Monday Alert" using
code "Alpha 123." There then
followed a series of coded mes-
sages as above culminating in ar-
rangements for a rendezvous with
a one-armed man at the junction
of Grosvenor and New Bond
Streets at 18.20 on Monday, 20th
November.
The Dramatic Society, as

blood.
King's secretary then phoned
the Union at lunch time and the
message about blood was inter-
preted as being a threat of phy-
sical violence; the alarm was
given and precautions taken
against the expected invasion for
the remainder of the day.
Inquiries around IC have
failed to locate anyone who
admits to definite knowledge of
Reggie's whereabouts. No noti-
fication was received by King's
within the 24 hours stated in the
rules of mascotry and as such
conduct is inconsistent with past
IC behaviour it is to be hoped
that the theft was the work of
some other college.
At the moment the shop is run
under the auspices of Mr.
Mooney, but the questionnaire
considers putting it under Union
control or letting it out to a pri-
vate firm.
The questionnaire has some
questions, on frequency of using
the shop, goods stocked, opening
hours, whether people would like
to have a weekly order, and
administration. The question
on administration is a bad one
since few people have sufficient
knowledge of the issues involved
to make a reasonable judgement.
Apart from this fault, the ques-
tionnaire could prove valuable in
producing a Southside shop which

advantage to use.

Two one-armed men were pre-
sent. One misled part of the
crowd into thinking that he
placed the adverts for a practical
joke; the other, the newspaper-
seller, was selling newspapers
