PROFESSOR BLACKETT
O R D E R O F M E R I T
F O R B L A C K E T T
Professor Blackett, one of I.C.'s most distinguished associates,
current President of the Royal Society, and Fellow of Imperial
College, was last Monday appointed to the Order of Merit by the
Queen.
Professor Blackett started his career at Cambridge in the days
of Rutherford under whom he studied for some years. In 1933 he was
made professor of physics at Birkbeck, where he stayed until elected
to the Langworthy Professorship of Physics at Manchester in 1937.
His work on cosmic rays in this period gained him election to the
Royal Society in 1933, the R.S. Medal in 1940 and a Nobel Prize in
1948.
Copley Medal
Fourteen years ago Professor
Blackett came to I.C. as Profes-
sor of Physics and Head of the
Physics Department. While con-
tinuing his work in cosmic rays he
also did considerable research in
the field of palaeomagnetism for
which he was awarded the Royal
Society Copley Medal in 1956.
Dean of R.C.S. from 1954 to
1963, he also sat on the council of
the D.S.I.R. and was chairman of
the R.G.C., in a period when a
phenomenal growth occurred in
grants to university departments
for scientific and technological
research.
From 1961 to 1963 Professor
Blackett was pro-Rector of I.C.'
In 1965 he retired, became Presi-
dent of the Royal Society, Com-
panion of Honour, and Senior
Research Fellow at I.C.
To be appointed to the Order
of Merit must be the crowning
glory to a career paved with hon-
ours for academic and admini-
strative excellence.

City and Guilds in two collections have netted £319.
Mines in one collection have netted £181.
RCS Physics 1 (and others) £152.
Maths £23.
As Guilds managed to collect £270 in one afternoon the value of
turning out in large numbers is obvious.
Guilds predict that they will collect £1,500 on collections.
Mines estimate £1,000.
Pete Dolwin predicts that Physics alone will collect £2,000.
Chris Palmer reminds all those without pools tickets to collect
them from their year reps and thanks all those whohelped in counting
the money.

Use of 400
parking bays
Amid the more obvious public
preparations for the introduction
of a parking meter system in the
Westminster City area, which in-
cludes I J C , the College has now
made public its plans for the use
of the 400 parking bays in Col-
lege controlled areas, which of
course are not subject to the new
meters.
In a letter to Ray Phillips, the
Rector, Lord Penney, outlined
the system for allocation of bays
which his parking committee had
put forward and which he had ac-
cepted. Car users will be split
into the following categories—the
disabled and resident staff (46
spaces), departmental vehicles
(16), visitors to the College (16),
resident union officers (12), regu-
lar staff commuters (200) and stu-
dents will get 110 spaces, 80 of
which will be for commuters.
£5 Charge
To those who are allotted
places there will be a charge of
£5 which will ensure that they
have a parking bay between
October and June each year.
There will also be a second class
of car sticker, obtained by appli-
cation, which will allow holders
to take part in a " free-for-all"
for the College bays during July,
August and September. As
meters are to be introduced
in January it has been decided
that a charge of £3 10s. will be
made to bay users for the period
January to June next year.
Students appear to have
emerged from the meetings of the
parking committee in a better
position than was atfirstfeared.
It was being rumoured, for in-
stance, around the beginning of
the session that the committee
would recommend that there
should be only 60 places for stu-
dent cars. On the grounds of
sheer "seniority" and because
many of them must live out of
London, because they have fami-
lies, the staff are clearly entitled
to a greater proportion of the
available spaces than students—
therefore, although some will ob-
viously be hit by these new re-
strictions, students as a body can
have little cause for complaint-
The closing date for applica-
tions for the student bays is 6'th
December when they will be Con-
sidered by the Executive plus
Rex Lowen and Bob Fryer. Car
owners will therefore know by
Christmas whether there will be
a bay available for them next
term.
Ed.: 8 pints of beer plus
£3 10s. is less than Is. an hour
for two terms!

Once again the improvement, in terms of balance, of RCS Union
meetings was evident at the meeting on October 21st with the agenda
including such diverse items as Frank Fuchs' ideas for attracting more
women to IC and a series of chalk races between prominent members
of the Union.
After the reading of the minutes, the announcement of Roger
Webb's appointment as the new secretary and the instigation of a
sub-committee to revise the constitution, R.C.S. vented its wrath on
the heads of the organisers of the swimming gala, who had allowed it
to clash with the R.C.S. carnival. There were, as Bob Mackman said,
still hopes that the date of the swimming gala would be changed, but
if this proves impracticable, then it would be moved half an hour
earlier to allow everyone a short breathing space between the two
events. The selection of the Physics Dept. rep followed in which Pete
Dolwin was voted in preference to Chris Craddock.
The real meat of the meeting Leading the opposition, jane
then came up with Frank Fuchs' Pearson, Martin Lack and Stew-
motion to investigate the possi-
bility of holding an R.C.S. open
day for VI form girls in order to
encourage more of them to come
to IC. Frank backed up by
Jeannie Prickett, starting from the
obvious standpoint that there are
too few girls at IC, argued that
the institution of open days would
go a long way to correcting the
disproportionate ratio. At the
moment girls thinking of applying
to this college are often given a
bad impression of the place by
their careers mistresses and head-
mistresses and open days could
hope to dispel those ill-founded
illusions.
art Barnes hammered home time
and time again the salient points
that the organization of such open
days would involve a great
amount of time and money and
what was there to show them any-
way? They also said that the
college authorities were doing
their utmost and offered the con-
structive suggestion that it should
not be the girls who were shown
round the college but their head-
mistresses and science teachers.
Teresa Smart, prodded no doubt
by Jari6 Pearson, attempted to
move an amendment to this
effect, but it was withdrawn after
frantic hurried discussions be-
tween Mackman, Fuchs and Jane
Pearson, on the ground that it
would alter the motion too dras-
tically. This seems a pity as there
is no doubt that this would pro-
vide the most practical and least
expensive solution to the problem.
Most of the secondary speeches
were in favour of the motion,
and mostly from people who have
been prominent supporters of
Frank Fuchs in. the past. Th§
opposition, too, as Derek Booth-
man pointed out, seemed to come
from those who have opposed
Fuchs in the past. It will be
regrettable if RCSU is split into
two opposing factors for the
whole year.
Anyway, after all the wrang-
ling, the motion was passed by a
show of hands and the General
Committee will have to investi-
gate the possibilities of these open
days.
Chalk
and noses
With the debate over, Malcolm
Duckett plugged RCS carnival,
with films, cabaret, discotheque
and three groups, including 1984
(again!). Mike Tait outlined
plans for RCS charity collections
ind then* he, Martin Lack and
Pete Dolwin indulged in races
with pieces of chalk and noses
along the length of the lecture
bench.
The meeting then drew to a
close with, as ever, a Kang6la.
