The whole field of computing,
computer " hardware," " soft-
ware " and other research is still
growing at a rapid rate, and the
personnel structure is by no
means rigid and fixed for all
time. Now is the time for those
who are interested to begin to
take part in this development.
That there is a shortage of
people to fill the positions which
are going to become available in
the senior range can be seen from
the much-bemoaned lack of com-
puter personnel at present seen
in all levels. The programmers
of to-day are the leaders of to-
morrow. A n d the shortage today
can be gauged from the salaries
paid to newly-trained program-
mers (the good and the bad
alike), and the fact that any
reasonable programmer or sys-
tems programmer can probably
up his salary by over £200 a year
simply by changing firms. It is a
fact that between the ages of 20
and 30 systems analysts rank
among the highest paid cate-
gories of professional and execu-
tive staff. The foregoing should
be sufficient to point out the need
for people, and in the coming
years the ability and experience
of the individual is going to be-
come of appropriately greater
importance.
Computers are used in an in-
creasing number of situations,
from scientific calculations to the
monitoring of heart patients in
hospital wards, from banking
(the new Giro services) to the re-
cording of the passage of bills
through the Florida legislature,
and new fields of application are
constantly opening up.
Apart from jumping straight
into programming with nothing
behind you but an Imperial Col-
lege one-week crash course in
Fortran programming (it can and
has been done to considerable
financial advantage), there are
several ways of entering the field,
by taking a course, by joining
one of the computer manufactur-
ing firms, or by becoming quali-
fied in a particular profession
and subsequently taking a course
and applying the results in that
profession.
The scope for using computers
is vast and getting vaster, and
the shortage of good men is not
shrinking. There are opportuni-
ties for considerable success in
this country (this is, incidentally,
not a field where all the high
salaries lie across the Atlantic),
and the present day is the most
opportune time to enter.
Q I L fires in particular. W e enjoy putting
them out with our "Light Water" - a
fluorocarbon which literally swallows
flames whole. Fluorochemicals are just
one branch of Chemistry which we are
playing about with at the moment. W e
play about with Polymers too. Another of
our favourite pastimes is Electronics. A
great many of us join in this game in the
most modern tape plant in the world.
There, we come up with a variety of
fascinating diversions including: video
tape for TV, computer tape for computers,
instrumentation tape for instruments and
one of the newest developments -
electron beam recording. Talking of new

games, we've added Aero-Space and
Nucleonics to our list. Which is why we
say it's fun to use your brain at 3 M .
Fun isn't all. The continued expansion and
development of this dynamic U.K. company -
part of an international organisation making and
marketing over 37,6*00 quality products - holds
exceptional challenge for graduates in Science,
Engineering, Arts and other disciplines. For the
man who applies himself with diligence and
initiative, promotion prospects are excellent -
the sign of a healthy growing company.
