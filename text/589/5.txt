After a relatively quiet period July was a
good month for the cinema, with several
very interesting releases.
O n e of the b e s t is J o h n B o o r m a n ' s
E x c a l i b u r , a fanciful adaptation of the legend
of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round
Table. The plot is a combination of many
themes; Uther Pendragon uses Merlin, the
wise m a g i c i a n , to enable him to seduce
Igrayne, wife of the Duke of Cornwall. Merlin's
price is the baby that is thus conceived, who is
raised without knowing his parents. Arthur
eventually becomes King and brings peace and
prosperity to the land, but his half-sister,
Morgana, is up to no good and Arthur must
defeat the evil Mordred before the 2hr 20
minutes is up. Needless to say, Guenevere,
Lancelot, Gawain, er al crop up along the way
to add to the excitement, but Nicol Williamson's
Merlin is particularly enjoyable. There is an
e x c i t i n g m i x t u r e of r o m a n c e , battle a n d
sorcery which adds up to a highly entertaining
and colourful epic.
Trailing a little way behind is Ken Russell's
Altered States, which I found disappointing
(not least because of the banal "love conquers
all" ending). There is no doubt that Russell has
produced a marvellous combination of images
a n d s o u n d w h i c h has m o m e n t s of sheer
brilliance. It is just about possible to swallow
the plot; gifted scientist E d w a r d J e s s u p
b e l i e v e s t h a t he c a n u n l o c k p r e v i o u s
experiences from the genetic structure of his
cells by the use of powerful hallucinogenic
drugs and sensory deprivation. He is staggered
to find that an actual physical metamorphosis
accompanies his mental regression and he
eventually reaches back to the actual moment
of creation in his relentless search for an
"ultimate truth". This wild premise is well
executed, with some marvellous hallucination
s e q u e n c e s and brilliant m a k e - u p by D i c k
Smith. What I find hard to believe is that
Russell sells out at the finale, and opts for such
a cliched anti-climax for his end sequence. A
great pity that such an imaginative film falls at
the final hurdle—it could have been a classic.
If you want to take your family to an unusual
and funny film, then Terry Gilliams's Time
Bandits would be ideal. Six dwarves steal a
map of the universe from the Supreme Being
(Ralph Richardson) and proceed to travel
through space and time committing daring
robberies. Along the way they pick up a young
boy, Kevin, whose wardrobe happens to be
one of the holes that the dwarves use to flee
the persuing Supreme Being. Together they
e n c o u n t e r N a p o l e o n , R o b i n H o o d , K i n g
Agememnon and eventually Evil himself in the
Fortress of Ultimate Darkness. It's a fast
moving children's fantasy which is strangely
appealing to adults as well. John Cleese makes
a brief appearance as a terribly polite and
philantrophic Robin H o o d which will stick in
my mind for a long time. A good family film.
M y favourite release is undoubtedly Steven
Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost ArU, another
family film. Harrison F o r d stars as Dr Indiana
J o n e s , an archeologist who specialises in
f i n d i n g h i d d e n t r e a s u r e s in d a n g e r o u s
l o c a t i o n s . T h e y e a r is 1936 a n d w h e n
American Intelligence discover that Hitler is on
the trail of the legendary A r k of the Covenant
(in which the original Ten Commandments
were kept), they send Jones to beat him to it.
Hitler believes that any army which carries the
A r k before it will be invincible and has set
Jones' arch rival, Belloq, the task of recovering
it from the lost city of Thannis.
W h a t e n s u e s is a well p a c e d a c t i o n
a d v e n t u r e story, in w h i c h J o n e s always
m a n a g e s to n a r r o w l y clear the h u r d l e s
p r e s e n t e d to h i m by H i t l e r ' s f a n a t i c a l
henchmen. I think that Jones is cast from a
similar mould to James Bond; a clever and
h a n d s o m e a d v e n t u r e r who singlehandedly
succeeds against tremendous odds. He has
more h u m a n qualities than the ever-slick
Bond however, and will undoubtedly re appear
in a sequel. The one failure of the film is that it
never quite achieves the sense of wonder and
awe which made the otherwise hollow C l o s e
Encounters succeed. In this case, however,
the story is tremendously enjoyable and it just
fails to be the "Ultimate Adventure" that the
adverts promise.
T a l k i n g about J a m e s B o n d , the latest
offering For Your Eyes Only is the best of all
the recent B o n d s . T h a n k f u l l y there is no
m a s s i v e s e t - p i e c e e n d i n g , but a greater
reliance on really tense, dramatic scenes which
works reasonably well.
The most disappointing film of the year is
the over-hyped Clash of the Titans. This
turned out to be a dull and uninspired "boy
meets girl, loses girl, gets girl back" story
which is only saved by Roy Harryhausen's
stop-motion animation. Even this does not
o v e r c o m e the d r e a r y a c t i n g a n d this is
definitely one to miss.
Finally the Buster Keaton Season at the
Electric Cinema still has a week to run. This is
a great chance to see some of the funniest
silent films ever made by the famous deadpan
c o m i c , w h o is s u r e l y one of the most
underrated comic talents of the century. Seats
are only £2 for a long feature and two shorts,
which show at least three times daily. I'll see
you there!

least favourite animal (top). Above, Dr. Jekyll goes ape in Altered States and tries to convince
Rosenburg and the marvellously cynical Mason.
