P.G. Tips
Hello, since this is a postgraduate issue, the
President and the P G C h a i r m a n proudly
present a joint effort. When the undergrads
return there will be articles about U G C cuts
and that sort of stuff, but for now a few words
about P G s and, more particularly, research
students.
At the Board of Studies at the end of last
term a proposal was passed that "writing-up"
students should pay fees. It seems this is just a
recommendation and the matter is still being
discussed. This is obviously a wider problem
than just a question of fee-paying. W e are,
once again, up against the worries of over-
running P h D s (for which IC is now famous)
and p o o r s u p e r v i s i o n . W e are extremely
concerned about these problems as are plenty
of other people in College. In the ideal world
P h D s t u d e n t s w o u l d h a v e f o u r y e a r s
sponsorship. Whilst a handful of students are
in this fortunate position, most are not and
there is little chance of establishing an ideal
world at present.
So let's cut this bullshit and tell you what we
want. W e want the impossible—comment and
discussion out of you lot. Research students
have a reputation for apathy and the response
to the q u e s t i o n n a i r e last year w a s not
staggering. Whether or not you wrote in then,
please send us any relevant comments you
have now. Address them to the President, IC
Union, and they will be treated in confidence;
you need not put your name to them.
Remember
Hiroshima
Thirty-six years ago, two atomic bombs were
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The
r e s u l t i n g h o r r o r , d e v a s t a t i o n a n d d e a t h
appalled the people of the world. In Japan,
some are still suffering as a direct consequence
of the attack.
Since 1945, the world's arsenal of nuclear
weapons has grown enormously. Following the
recent increase in international tension, people
have become aware, once again, of how real
the threat of nuclear holocaust is. It is hard to
appreciate the numbers involved. The size of
the Hiroshima bomb was about 13 kilo tons (ie
an explosive power equivalent to 13,000 tons
of T N T ) . A bomb now would typically be
between 1 Megaton and 5 Megatons; that is,
between 76 and 385 Hiroshimas. We should
realize that all the explosives, all the bombs,
shells and mines used by all countries during
the whole ol World War II amounted to about
5 m i l l i o n t o n s of T N T . A l l that is n o w
concentrated into one typical bomb and there
are tens of thousands of such weapons.
We must all remember the horror caused by
those two tiny (by today's standards) bombs
d r o p p e d on J a p a n . T h e four days from
Hiroshima Day (yesterday) to Nagasaki Day
( S u n d a y , 9 A u g u s t ) are set a s i d e for
commemoration. A two minute silence will be
observed internationally from 11:00 to 11:02am
this Sunday. Please respect this. If you would
like to wear a commemorative armband with
the design show at the lop of this article,
please ring Owen Greene on int 2960 today.

Y o u might like to consider the following
questions:
Will you over-run three years?
If s o , will you be writing or still doing
experimental work?
In either of these cases, do you consider it
fair that you should pay fees?
Why do students over-run?
Is there a problem of selection of suitable
candidates for research?
Should a more comprehensive review of
progress be made after one year?
Are projects too complicated to complete in
three years?
Is there adequate supervision of experimental
work, especially in the initial stages?
Is there adequate s u p e r v i s i o n of thesis
preparation, especially regarding timing?
D o supervisors encourage students to do
experimental work right to the bitter end at the
expense of writing up?
If you have a problem with your supervisor,
is there anybody in the department you can
consult?
And finally, returning to fees, how easy
would it be for you to go "underground" and
c o n t i n u e b e y o n d t h r e e y e a r s w i t h o u t
registering as writing up?
Bear in mind that the College has suffered a
reduction in its estimated budget with the
U G C letter and is obviously looking to cover
any drain on its resources be those resources
material or lecturers' time and energy.
H e a v y a r t i c l e , eh? S o r r y , but please
consider writing in. Perhaps we can give you
better news soon. O n a lighter note, we hope
those of you who went on the Cambridge trip
had a jolly spiffing time.

O/A Level
Tutoring
Have you ever thought about earning some
extra cash by tutoring O / A Level students?
The Postgraduate G r o u p is prepared, given
enough interest, to adverise on your joint
behalf, t h r o u g h the a p p r o p r i a t e c h a n n e l s
(press, etc.). The idea of such a scheme would
be to put tutor and tutee in touch with each
other. If you are interested in using this
experimental scheme leave particulars of your
subject area and location with the Student
Services at 15 Princes Gardens.
Mr Armstrong
introduces the
Officers
Just a few lines to let you know who the P G
Group Officers are for next year and what we
have planned. The officers are:
Doug Armstrong—Chairman
Bob Rollins—Social Secretary
Jim Downey—Treasurer
Dave Wood—Welfare Officer
Paul Hayman—Secretary
Last year we held several p l o u g h m a n ' s
lunches which were fairly successful and will
continue next year. The two events that were
held in the evening, the dinner and the party,
were not very well attended. The Cambridge
Trip was its usual success.
If you have any ideas for events next year,
please let us know, we can be contacted
through the Union Office.
If you want money for a P G event in your
department, remember you can get a subsidy
from P G G r o u p funds.
Finally, on a more serious note, we would
appreciate it if you would let us know your
opinions on the proposed writing-up fees for
PGs.
Wilt y o u be in Edinburgh this summer?
Then come and see Dramsoc performing three
shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Yes
folks, we've hit the big time—brighter than the
footlights, more original than the O x f o r d
R e v u e , m o r e p r e s t i g i o u s t h a n R o w a n
Atkinson.
Dramsoc will be right in the centre of action,
at Edinburgh University's New Chaplaincy
C e n t r e , and we'll be w o r k i n g a 25hr day
producing three completely original plays, all
written by Dramsoc members, performed by
Dramsoc members, with the help of Dramsoc
Technology. It all starts on the 15th of August
at Bristo Street, Edinburgh and performances
are at 12:30 (lunchtime) and 9:00pm. Last night
is on the 29th August so you have just two
short weeks to see history made. Tickets cost
£1.25 (or 75p to you students and claimants)
and you can get them on the door or at the
fring box office. O u r venue number is 23 and
we're upstairs. See you there!
