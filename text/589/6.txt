Hi, guess tuho's back again in charge of
exposes, scandals, caustic comments and
wry wit? Mr Smith has wisely decided to
let me continue casting my eye over some
of the more unusual and amusing aspects
of College life. For this issue, however, I
thought it only right to commemorate the
glorious wedding of our future King by
presenting a few of my own observations.
Wlm aiJkeTgg
IT is r e p o r t e d that half a million people
attended the firework display in Hyde Park on
the eve of the great day. What a pity that most
of them bought their cars with them to fill the
streets around College with a near stationary
m a s s for h o u r s a f t e r it w a s a l l o v e r .
Fortunately not everybody had to endure the
crowds. The Rector, College Secretary and a
few bright sparks from the Union, along with
some friends and family, had the foresight to
go up the Q u e e n ' s T o w e r to w a t c h the
frivolity. G o o d for them! I naturally avoided
such a move after reading that at a similar
display in 1746, one man was killed by falling
out of the tree from which he had chosen to
view the fireworks. Do you realise how high
the Queens Tower is?
H O W many of you noticed that there was not'
a Union Jack flying from the flagpole on the
Union Building on the great day? It appears
that the Union doesn't even possess a flag. Are
there no true patriots left at this College? Why,
if I'd noticed sooner I would have run my
Union Jack underwear up as a substitute! 1

IT A P P E A R S that there is at least one loyal
subject in the Union. Honorary Secretary
Maro Ledwold has not only one, but two
Union Jacks in his room. WhurI'm surprised
that he didn't dash out a n d ^ u n one up the
flagpole himself.
B E A U T I F U L Lady Diana Spencer has quite an
amazing family tree. Through her mother she
is related to no fewer than eight American
Presidents (not including the present one,
thank goodness) as well as Humphrey Bogart
and General Patton.
But the biggest surprise is on her father's
side of the family. It turns out that Private
BV B B WolffG £Ve's columnist Auberon Waugh is her fifth
" cousin and editor Richard Ingrams her second
c o u s i n o n c e r e m o v e d . W e l l f a n c y t h a t !
Perhaps Private Eye's novelisation of the Royal
Romance, Born to be Queen, is nearer to the
truth than you might first expect.
Tmm pah
H A V I N G M E N T I O N E D Born to be Queen, I
must say I f o u n d the s e r i a l i s a t i o n v e r y
funny. The romance between Prince Charles
and lovely doe-eyed Lady Diana Spencer is
told in hilarious style by Sylvie Krin and has
now been published in a book, priced at only
95p. W e follow the tense d r a m a of the
courtship, the inevitable photographers, the
i n t r u s i o n of s t e p - g r a n d m o t h e r B a r b a r a
Cartland and much more.
While this book was at number ten in the
best-selling books list during the wedding
week, the number one proved to be another
surprise. It wasn't the official Royal Wedding
Souvenir, but the satirical publication Not the
Royal Wedding, a send-up produced by John
Lloyd and Sean Hardie which features the
team from Not the Nine O'Clock News. This is
packed with irreverent humour which mildly
lampoons the Royal couple. It's good to see
that even our most prestigious ocasions bring
forward touches of well-groomed humour.
M Y E Y E S nearly popped out of their sockets
when I read a recent article in The Grauniad
concerning the American President, Ronnie
Raygun. Apparently there is a strong rumour
in the West Coast radical press over there that
a sort of constitutional figurehead, similar to
the Queen, may be introduced to relieve the
p r e s s u r e f r o m the P r e s i d e n t . S u r p r i s e ,
surprise, Nancy Raygun is keen to put her and
old hopalong up as candidates in the suggested
national poll by which such a position would be
elected.
N o w this leads on to the Royal Wedding and
Nancy's visit. It has caused quite a stir that the
American first lady has outrightly refused to
curtsey to anybody (a Very strange thing for
the wife of an elected representative to do!)
and it seems that she is very keen to pick up all
the tips on etiquette from our own Royal
Family.
C a n you imagine it—King Ronald the first!
N o wonder they tried to shoot him.
Stupid Stmvmim
O N E T H I N G that won't be missed following
the great event are the piles of ridiculous
souvenirs which one has to wade through on
arriving at any shop. Have you seen those
revolting tea towels, the pictures on which
look more like Joe Bugner and Dandy Nichols
than our own Prince and his bride?
The worst item that I have come across is
the Royal Wedding Frisbee—good heavens
whatever will they think of next!
Someone tells me that there is actually a
Royal Wedding Rubik's Cube, with pictures of
the happy couple.
T O P M A R K S must go to the recently re-opened Scala Cinema at Kings Cross for a witty piece of
programming. O n the opening day in their new premises, which was formerly an ape house, they
billed King Kong with Mighty Joe Young. Furthermore, as their contribution to the Royal Wedding
they had a double-bill consisting of The Bride of Frankenstein and / Married a Monster from
Outer Space. Well done!
