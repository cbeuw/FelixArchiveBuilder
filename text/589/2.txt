.Sir
M a y I lake this opportunity lo
p r o t e s t most s t r o n g l y a b o u t
c o n t e n t i o u s m a t e r i a l i n t h i s
year's I C U Freshets' Handbook.
Contained within, as I discovered
alter seeing pageprools at the
printers, are the most vicious
a t t a c k s o n V i c t o r M o o n e y
C a p t a i n L i n d l e y a n d L o r d
Flowers I have seen to date.
While agreeing with the broad
sentiments expressetl I feel they
are grossly overstated. Moreover,
it is a disgrace that such conten-
tious comments will be foisted
u p o n a v e r y i m p r e s s i o n a b l e
fresher intake. Never before has a
•Union p u b l i c a t i o n sought to
influence opinions in such an
obvious manner prior to term!
It is perfectly understandable
that such a s i t u a t i o n s h o u l d
occur. Paid Donovan, the H a n d -
b o o k E d i t o r , is a first y e a r
s t u d e n t a n d h a s , p e r h a p s ,
become a little carried away by
the v i n d i c t i v e n e s s a n d m a l i c e
shown towards M r Moone y and
Capt Lindley that was prevalent
in the F E L I X Office last year.
The (anonymous) author of the
article is none other than Patrick
C o l l , e x - F E L I X News Editor.
S o u r e d by his r e c e n t m a t h s
failure he has sought to "go out
with a b a n g " , to use his own
words. But the one factor that is
b e y o n d m y c o m p r e h e n s i o n is
that M r N M o r t o n , I C U Presi-
dent, has told me that he had
seen the H a n d b o o k and approved
of it. W h i l e not e n c o u r a g i n g
Presidential intervention in an
editorial matter. I wonder how
he c o u l d possibly a p p r o v e of
articles that are sure to incense
the College and are extremely
unfair to the individuals con-
cerned, in that no right ol reply is
offered.
B e a r i n g i n m i n d t h a t the
College has kindly agreed to mail
out the H a n d b o o k to freshers. I
a m surprised that M r M o r t o n ,
who has overall responsibility for
Uniort matters, and. of course,
the Handbook, should consider
the matter so unimportant.
Yours faithfully

.Sir • '
I am obliged to you for showing
me a letter from one S Marshall,
a n i l l u s t r i o u s h o n o r a r y l i f e -
member of I C U . Typically, he
has twisted facts and comments
to his own end. H e implies that
M r P a t r i c k C o l l has w r i t t e n
articles a b o u t Messrs L i n d l e y
and Mooney when we all know
M r Marshall himself is respon-
sible for this entire campaign.
However, I shall not dwell on M r
Marshall's low journalistic and
moral standards as these are well-
known.
M y position on the Handbook
a r t i c l e s i n q u e s t i o n is q u i t e
clear—I have not seen them. It is
t r u e t h a t I s a w most of the
Handbook at paste-up stage and
gave an unofficial nodolapproval.
H o w e v e r , the articles on o u r
good friends in College were not
a v a i l a b l e a n d it c o m p l e t e l y
s l i p p e d m y m i n d to ask the
H a n d b o o k E d i t o r i f he was
hiding any contentious, abusive
material from my all-pervading
self. Silly me. I must take full
responsibility for this dreadful
oversight. I am only sorry that
M r Marshall did not draw my
attention to these articles as I am
reliably informed that he was
occasionally seen in the F E L I X
Office when the Handbook was
being prepared.
As the person finally respon-
sible lor all U n i o n affairs I am
certain to be the recipient of irate
phone calls when the Handbook
reaches the Sheriield Building.
Naturally I will deal with such
calls in my normal diplomatic
manner.
I look forward to an informed
a n d i n f o r m a t i v e F E L I X this
year.
lours faithfully
Nick M o r t o n
I C U H a c k
Ed's Note: I thought it only fair
to g i v e t h e P r e s i d e n t , N i c k
M o r t o n , the right of reply to M r
M a r s h a l l ' s letter ( c o n s i d e r i n g
there is not another F E L I X until
O c t o b e r ) . T h i s p r o m p t e d the
above reply.
O n further consideration, the
President decided to approach
C a p t a i n Lindley, informing h i m
of the offending articles. W o r d
also reached the Rector(who had
w r i t t e n the f o r e w o r d to the
Handbook) and he made it quite
clear that College would not mail
it o u t i f these a r t i c l e s w e r e
i n c l u d e d . P r i n t i n g has b e e n
stopped and the articles will not
appear.
I a m certain that College would
have looked carefully anyway.
W h a t their reaction would have
been is a matter of speculation.
Dear Sir
I feel I am voicing the feelings
ol many when I say how disgusted
I was by the obnoxious behaviour
of some people on the recent
Cambridge day-trip. Indeed. I
am forced to the conclusion that
some of the people on the outing
only went to get drunk.
Let me point out some of the
deficiencies in the actions of the
r i n g l e a d e r s w h i c h 1
1

1 e r 1 y
d i s g r a c e d this U n i o n . F i r s t l y ,
some people arrived late al the
c o a c h . T h i s was c o m p l e t e l y
indefensible. Secondly, when in
Cambridge, many of the group
spent most of their lime at a
"Beer Festival" when they could
have been a d m i r i n g the aesthetic
beauty of Cambridge's marvel-
lous architecture. These points,
w h i c h w o u l d c o n d e m n t h e
participants for evermore, pale
into insignificance when com-
pared with the most disturbing
aspects of the trip.
I refer, ol course, to the singing
oi callously crude and indecent
songs.
II any ol the intent ions outlined
in these songs w e r e , h e a v e n
forbid, to take place, then the
participants would surely lease
themselves open lo charges of
indecent exposure, assault, and
inciting racial hatred, to name
but four. (I don't stand and count
'em.)
There can be no excuse lor this
behaviour. I cannot help asking if
those people would have behaved
in the same way il their mothers
w e r e p r e s e n t . I n d e e d , y o u
yourself, sir, were on thai coach
and I have no doubt thai you
were one of the instigators. Fie on
y o u , y o u b r a z e n - f a c e d m a l e -
factor.
I was delighted to see though,
that our glorious sabbaticals Were
not on this trip; there is still some
honour left in this institution.
Finally, I call lor the abolition
o f t h i s t r i p , o t h e r w i s e , the
extreme consequences of further
trips would be an abominable
corruption, which would result
even in civilised institutions, such
as this c o l l e g e , a d o p t n g the
b a r b a r o u s customs of c e r t a i n
savage tribes.

.S'i'r
I am not one to write reams of
meaningless drivel just to get my
name in F E L I X but, this time I
feel I r e a l l y m u s t m a k e a n
exception and put pen to paper.
Seriously, in all my time at IC I
have never been so shocked, nor
so annoyed by what is going on.
I thought that there must be
some integrity left in the students
of today but apparently there is
not so much as one grain of
common sense or decency in any
one of them.
It is a far cry from my first days
at university when students were
looked upon as responsible, up-
standing citizens who, if at times
a little boisterous, were at least,
genuinely trustworthy people.
N o t so t o d a y ! It was o n l y
recently that the true depravity
to which students at I C have
fallen was brought home to me in
a fashion which left me speechless
w i t h disgust. T h e r e f o r e I a m
impelled to write this lettor in the
hope that perhaps some of your
readers will pull their socks up.
Tours sincerely
