Southside
Snippets
T H E C O L L E G E has again been
the v e n u e for s e v e r a l l a r g e
conferences,. which take advan-
tage of the S u m m e r A c c o m -
odation scheme to house their
delegates. Conferences ranged
in subject from R a d i a t i o n Safety
to Midwifery. In fact this year
was the Centenery of the R o y a l
College of M i d w i v e s , and these
f o r t u n a t e d e l e g a t e s s p e n t a n '

T H E S U M M E R Accomodation
Centre ( S A C ) seems to be one of
the few places where anything
happens over the summer. So it
seems strange that it was decided
to paint the S A C Office ceiling
recently when the office was at
its busiest. Whether this was to
make up for the appalling state of
the R o y a l C o l l e g e of S c i e n c e
U n i o n Office, which is nearby
and has been mistaken for part of
t h e S u m m e r A c c o m o d a t i o n
scheme, remains uncertain.

specialist texts. By advertising the
fact that these conferences were

Hicks was able to get texts from
publishers on a "sale or return"
basis. This not only meant that
visitors from as far away as the
Far East and Australia did not
have to wait while books were
ordered and mailed, but also that
bookshop revenue was increased.
H A L L B U R S A R M r s D i a n a
Y a r r o w was shocked to discover
that an old English sheepdog had
been kept in a K e o g h H a l l room
by a visitor. This is, of course,
against H a l l regulations.

pressed over the way in which
visitors to Southside are often
given the wrong keys on arrival
at the S A C Office. This means
that people are given access to
rooms in which valuable items
m a y h a v e b e e n left by t h e
occupant.
T h e situation is so bad that the
F E L I X Editor, M r M a r k Smith ,
returned to his room one day to
find a bemused cardiologist who
could not understand why he had
been given a room full of clothes
a n d books. C a p t a i n L i n d l e y ,
D o m e s t i c S e c r e t a r y , was u n -
available to comment on how
m a n y times this m i s t a k e h a d
occurred.
Hacks Hacked!
T H E E N D O F Y E A R examinations provided their usual mixture of
triumphs and failures.
A c a d e m i c A f f a i r s O f f i c e r s d i d w e l l . I C U A A O B o b B r a d l e y
graduated with First Class Honours, as did M i n e s A A O Pete Bamford.
R C S A A O , Dave Lyons achieved an U p p e r Second which secured h i m
a P h D in the Chemistry Department.
T h e incoming C C U Officers normally have more than their share of
failures. Guilds seem to have taken the worst of it this year with the
Vice-President, Nick Jenkins, and Publicity Officer, Dave M i l l e t ,
having failed to qualify. Guilds President A n d y Rushton has managed
to get a place on an M S c course as expected, but as yet has not
been offered a grant and may have to finance it himself. T h e External
Affairs Officer and F E L I X Business M a n a g e r , Patrick C o l l , have also
failed, which will result in two elections at the start of the next session.
A l l of the sabbaticals managed to satisfy the good academic standing
qualification. I C U President Nick M o r t o n completed the third year of
his P h D course, whilst Deputy President Barney M c C a b e narrowly
missed a T h i r d in ¥hys\cs(dip[omatic-Ed). H o n o r a r y Secretary M a r c o
L e d w o l d achieved T h i r d Class Honours in Chemistry, and the F E L I X
Editor, M a r k Smith took a L o w e r Second in Physics.
