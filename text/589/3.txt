Hot
penguin
T H E S A B B A T I C A L Executive
Officers did not seem to learn
m u c h at the r e c e n t t r a i n i n g
school held at W y e College, but
they d i d manage to return with
West He Id C o l l e g e ' s mascot, a
large toy penguin.
Barney M c C a b e , I C U Deputy
President, was asked to drive
Wcstfield College to the training
school. They were so shocked by
his driving that they insisted that
he stay in the back on the return

the penguin. By cleverly m a n -
oeuvring the mascot to the real ol

B a r n e y d a s h e d out at P r i n c e
Consort R o a d taking the penguin
with him. W h e n questioned, his
strange behaviour various excuses
were offered which convinced
the Wcstlicld College students
present. In fact, it was not until
s o m e t i m e l a t e r t h a t I C U
President, Nick M o r t o n , iiilbrmcd
Westlield of their loss over the
telephone. Il appears that they
hadn't even noticed.
T h e penguin is now in the
U n i o n Office and no arrange-
ments have been made to return
it.
I.C. gets off lightly
Imperial College remains relatively unscathed after the
University Grants Committee (UGC) distributed the
Government's reduced grant to universities early in July.
T h e countrywide effect of the reduced grant levels is that there will
be thousands fewer university places available for home students hy
1984/5. At this College, however, the U G C has recommended that
student numbers are to rise by 170 by 1983/4. Part of this increase will
be immediately absorbed by the category change for Greek students,
who will be classed as E E C rather than overseas students following
Greece's entry into the C o m m o n Market. The net increase in student
numbers will be 122. This means that lor each of the next three years,
approximately 40 extra students will be taken on. In the forthcoming
session this will be distributed as follows: 10 Life Sciences; 5 Chemistry;
5 Geology; 5 M i n e r a l Resources E n g i n e e r i n g ; 5 C h e m E n g . 5
C o m p u t i n g and 5 to M e e h E n g .
This increase in students, though, is to occur simultaneously with a
decrease in the College's grant. This year the College asked the U G C
lor ,£25m, but the grant allocated was just slightly over £23m. Also the
U G C has provisionally indicated a decrease to £21.6m by 1983/4 at
today's prices.
The U G C letter to the University ol L o n d o n singles out I C for
special treatment. Whilst all the rest of the universities institutions are
considered together, I C is specifically recommended to increase its
numbers in the biological sciences. As well as receiving £23.2m of
recurrent grant, the College is also given £3.14m for equipment and
furniture, £42,000 lor microprocessors and £\8,000 lor the Linstead
extension.
The effects of the U G C cut of 14% over the next three years cannot
be fully envisaged. As people retire, Ibr instance, they may not be
replaced, and the Governing Body at its J u n e 19 meeting could not
rule out the possibility of compulsory redundancies. In the session some
cuts may be absorbed by slight surpluses from last year. Departments
may have to take a 2.5% cutback, and the refectory account may have
to start bearing more overheads, although I C U finances and the
Residence Account will probably be left alone.
The U G C grant makes up 50% of College income: the rest comes
from overseas students fees and outside earnings. These could be
boosted by having a firm sponsor a professional chair. The College has
been actively seeking funds from outside to boost the U G C grant,
especially by setting up interdepartmental sections, eg robotics.
P.G. trip to Cambridge
A S I N previous years, the P G G r o u p organised a trip to this year's
C a m b r i d g e Beer festival. The festival was smaller than the one held
annually at the Alexandra Palace, but still offered a selection of real ales
from 2b different breweries. The trip afforded an opportunity to look
round the town, as the festival shut for a while in mid-afternoon, but
poor weather precluded the traditional punting expeditions. Numbers
were down on lasl year, and only one coach was taken; this was
possibly due to the poor weather.
Shop for the

A t present the regalia is being
sold from the U n i o n Office, but
the Executive is looking into the
possibility of starting a U n i o n
Shop which will sell other items
and be run by a permanent staff
member.
