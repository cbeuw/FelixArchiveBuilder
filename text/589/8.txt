A New Broom
W e l c o m e to issue number 589, the first that
I have produced. This F E L I X may look very
similar to last year's—I a m using up some
excess covers on this issue and the main
F E L I X b a n n e r w i l l r e m a i n t h e s a m e
throughout the year. It is all too easy to
make change merely for the sake of change,
so I intend to try a n d modify a n d improve as
I go along rather than go for a complete
change.
Writing Up Students
I k n o w very little about the problems of
p o s t g r a d u a t e s a n d t h e " w r i t i n g u p "
category. The article on page 4 by the
P r e s i d e n t a n d P G G r o u p C h a i r m a n
i n c l u d e s a n a p p e a l for i n f o r m a t i o n . It
doesn't take m u c h effort to put a note into
the internal mail, so I hope that there is a
staggering response.
Postgraduate Hall
Having viewed the building in Montpelier
Street which the College seems almost
certain to purchase, I must say that it is
quite a find situated just around the corner
f r o m H a r r o d s it is w e l l s i t u a t e d a n d ,
a l t h o u g h by n o m e a n s p e r f e c t , is i n
reasonable condition. A lot of hard work is
needed to prepare it for habitation and if it is
ready for October there will certainly be a
few creases left to iron out. A l s o , I would
wait for further details to be posted around
College before bombarding the Student
Services Office with enquiries.
SAC
I couldn't believe that the ceiling of the
S u m m e r A c c o m m o d a t i o n Centre Office in
Southside was recently painted. This r o o m
is a reception area for visitors living in the
halls of residence over the summer and is
empty for about eight months of the year.
W h y people should be subjected to the
smell and mess of paint when it is totally
unnecessary I don't know.
Handbook Trouble
I must say that the reaction to M r Marshall's
letter (page 2) is not surprising. Whilst
a g r e e i n g w i t h s o m e of the s e n t i m e n t s
expressed in the offending articles, I cannot
really condone the way in which they would
have influenced freshers before reaching
College. W h e n I first saw the articles they
s t r u c k m e as h u m o r o u s r a t h e r t h a n
offensive, but in retrospect I can see that
they were bound to cause a reaction from
the College administration. I only hope that
the individual(s) concerned do the decent
thing and make suitable apologies.
Dramsoc at the Fringe
Y o u all have a chance to see the D r a m s o c
offerings for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe
next Tuesday (August 11) at 7:30pm in the
U n i o n C o n c e r t Hall. There is no admission
fee.
The Royal Wedding
It warmed the heart to see so many people
having s u c h a great time o n July 29. Whilst I
found it heard to take any interest in the
trivia which commentators padded the day
with, I enjoyed the relaxed air which the
event inspired.
Fox Farewell
F o r m e r R C S U and I C U President Chris
F o x is due to fly out to Bolivia as soon as the
political situation over there clears. I'm sure
we'd all like to wish him good \u-~.k in his new
job.

T h e m o n s t r o u s t a s k of c o l l a t i n g the
Freshers' issue will take place over the
weekend 2-4 October. A l l hands will be
appreciated.
' Jusf two hours more
I seem to have spent all my waking hours
in the F E L I X Office this week. The job is
certainly a lot harder than it may appear
f r o m the o u t s i d e a n d I a m p a r t i c u l a r l y
grateful to the following people for their
help: H e c t o r C a m e r o n C l a r k (especially for
the p h o t o g r a p h o n the c o v e r ) , M a r t i n ,
S t e v e , D a v e , P a t r i c k , S h a n n e (Diamid!)
Douglas, N i c k , Barney, T i m , Matt, M a z & I a n .
It w o n ' t be l o n g n o w b e f o r e s c o r e s of
musicians (pun intended) set up their week-
long vigil on the steps of Albert Hall for that
great national institution, the Last Night of the
Proms.
There is great skill involved in this queueing.
If you're too near the front of the queue, you
are committed to several unnecessarily lonely"
nights on the pavement, to say nothing of the
danger of being trampled underfoot by the
stampeding mob when the doors are opened,
the other hand, if you're too near the back of
the queue you may not get a place at the front
of the hall, and so miss out on the mass
hysteria, the chance to appear on television,
and the smell of the conductor's socks.
T o determine the best place to stand, I
tracked down the seven people at the front of
last year's queue, and quizzed them about the
order they were standing in. I elicited five
pieces of information.
Derrick said: There was at least one person
between me and Suzanne.
Dave said: If I wasn't fourth in line, then
Suzanne was.
Martin said: There was exactly one person
between Karen and Derrick.
Bernard said: Martin was somewhere in the
line between Derrick and myself, but Suzanne
was not.
The girls said: John was in front of both of
us, but Dave and Derrick were both behind us"
in the queue.
But feelings run high, and competition is
stiff, it seems, for I later discovered that one of
the statements is false.
What order did the seven stand in?
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o
FELIX by 1:00pm on Wednesday 19th August,
please. The usual prize of £5 will be awarded
to the first correct solution opened on that
date.
The Editor desperately
trying to avoid another
space-filler.
Hopefully, this space
will become smaller
throughout the year.
