astronauts at the lunar south pole of
the Moon in 2024. This is an ambitious
target, and many have questioned the
viability of the project, with the ESA
acknowledging in their announcement
that “it will be a close-run thing to have
it ready, tested, and working by 2024”.
This is not where the ambition ends –
NASA Administrator, Jim Bridenstine,
has said that after this mission, the plan
is to establish “a long-term presence on
the Moon by the end of the decade”.
The ESA will be initially involved
with the “Lunar Gateway”, a space
station that will orbit around the moon
and allow for more frequent lunar
exploration. The ESA will supply service
modules that provide the crew with air,
water and electricity on their journey to
the Gateway on NASA’s Orion space-
craft. They will also deliver modules to
the Gateway itself, including a pressur-
ised living area called the I-Hab and a
module for refuelling and communica-
tions with Earth.
During the Artemis Programme, the
ESA and other international partners
will land robotic equipment on the
moon’s surface to take samples and
conduct experiments, in prepara-
tion for the arrival of astronauts
at the lunar south pole. Once
Artemis-III is under-
way, the ESA will
support the
astronauts
landing
on the
moon
by pro-
viding
com-
munica-
tions with
the Lunar
Pathfinder satellite. The contract for the
building of this satellite has been award-
ed to the UK company, Surrey Satellites
Technology.
While the UK space agency is
still part of the ESA,
the UK’s in-
volvement in
Project Ar-
temis goes
beyond the
ESA/NASA
agreement. This
week, the UK Space
Agency, along with
partners in Aus-
tralia, Canada,
Italy, Japan,
Luxem-
bourg,
and
the
UAE,
also
an-
nounced the signing of the “Artemis
Accords”. These are a set of principles
which will guide future exploration of
space. Science Minister Amanda Sollo-
way said that the agreement “underlines
our commitment to strengthening the
UK’s role in the global space sector”.
Given the current political climate and
the ongoing negotiations about the
UK’s exit from the European Union, it
is not surprising to see the UK Space
Agency attempting to separate itself
from the ESA and establish itself as its
own global power in space exploration.
The Artemis programme, though
ambitious and expensive, is an exciting
prospect for the future of space explo-
ration. If the programme succeeds in
landing the first woman on the moon,
it will no doubt inspire a generation of
young women to become interested in
outer space and science. The project will
involve more international collaboration
than NASA has seen since the construc-
tion of the International Space Station.
If it succeeds, it could be the gateway for
humanity’s exploration of space, further
than we have ever gone before.

Further evidence that oil company ExxonMobil
misled the public on climate change
Harvard University researchers
have responded to the oil and gas
giant’s criticism of their 2017 peer-re-
viewed analysis, which showed that Exx-
onMobil has misled the public about
the severity of climate change.
In 2017, Geoffrey Supran and
Naomi Oreskes from the Department
of the History of Science at Harvard
University published their analysis of
ExxonMobil’s climate change commu-
nications between 1977 and 2014. They
performed “empirical document-by-doc-
ument textual content analysis of 187
climate change communications from
ExxonMobil”. Their analysis found that
the publicly available communications
produced by the company, and in par-
ticular, the editorial-style advertisements
they released (referred to as “advertori-
als” in their research), contained expres-
sions of doubt about climate change
being real and caused by human activity.
While 83% of peer-reviewed papers
and 80% of internal documents pro-
duced by ExxonMobil acknowledged
that climate change is “real and hu-
man-caused”, just 12% of advertorials
acknowledged this. In fact, 81% of
these advertisements expressed doubt
about anthropogenic
global warming. The
researchers concluded
that, while ExxonMo-
bil was contributing
to advancing climate
science, they were
simultaneously pro-
moting doubt in the
public mind about the
existence of climate
change.
In the same aca-
demic journal where
this study was pub-
lished, ExxonMobil President Vijay
Swarup published a criticism of Supran
and Oreskes’s research. Swarup claimed
that the analysis only assessed a small
subset of the available advertorials in the
New York Times, and that the original
publication “obscured the separateness
of… Exxon and Mobil”, who are techni-
cally two corporations.
Supran and Oreskes have now pub-
lished a response
to these crit-
icisms, and
have in fact
showed that the
ExxonMobil’s
communications
were even more
misleading than
they initially
thought. They
have rebutted
both of Supran’s
key criticisms,
noting that only
4% or less of all advertorials published
by Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp in
the New York Times had any discussion
of anthropogenic climate change, and
explaining that the original study explic-
itly attributed each of the advertorials
assessed to Exxon, Mobil or ExxonMo-
bil Corp. The new research shows that
Exxon and Mobil both separately misled
the public, and continued to do so
following their merger into ExxonMobil
Corp.
Supran and Oreske also note that
following the publication of their initial
study, they became aware of additional
relevant articles (which were highlight-
ed by Swarup in his criticisms). Their
new research shows that these addi-
tional materials actually strengthen the
argument that Exxon, Mobil and Exx-
onMobil Corp misled the public, and
provide greater evidence that all three
companies published communications
expressing doubt about anthropogenic
climate change.
