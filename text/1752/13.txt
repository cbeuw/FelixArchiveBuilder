COMMENT
Many of us will have heard of ‘the
North-South divide’ in casual
banter and passing conversation,
usually between a Mancunian with
no personality and an Essex boy. This
includes but is not limited to: ‘Reading
is way better than Leeds’, ‘why does
everyone get offended in the South?’ or
‘mate, why are you drinking a mug of
gravy?’.
Despite its superficial appearance,
there is an overwhelming amount of
evidence to suggest the North-South
divide cuts deep into the UK’s health,
social and economic systems, putting
northerners at a significant disadvan-
tage. This may be best exemplified
through the government’s management
of COVID-19.
As you have probably heard by now,
London has been moved to Tier 2 on
BoJo’s 3-Tier system. This news prob-
ably came to your dismay; no more
gatherings of six indoors? Restaurants
closed at 10pm? No meeting anybody
outside your house or support bubble?
It’s a nightmare!
What you may not know is that
Manchester has been fighting to re-
main in this tier, with the government
imposing Tier 3 on its Merseyside
neighbour Liverpool with threats of
similar fates for the football capital.
Tier 3 means no mingling with any-
body outside your house or bubble at
all, be it in your gran’s tea room or the
beautiful (and very safe) parks that
Liverpool has to offer; conversely, you
can still get a carvery dinner and a pint
in your local harvesters surrounded by
100s of strangers provided that your ta-
ble of 6 is within your support bubble
or household.
The ramifications of a Tier 3 lock-
down are quite dire. On a social level
a lot of people will be locked back up
in their tiny claustrophobic houses
– many without gardens - unable to
socialise with their friends, work out
in the gym or have a pint in the pub
(the last option a fair sacrifice in my
opinion). Economically, Liverpool
will trundle to a halt with most of the
service sector out of business and it
may not recover causing the loss of
many independent stores, restaurants
and venues.
One may argue that the reason
Liverpool has been put into Tier 3 is
because COVID-19 transmission is
higher there and as a result, restric-
tions must be tighter; of course, this
is true but the root cause for this high
transmission rate isn’t Liverpool’s
fault. When Eat Out to Help Out
(EOTHO) started, us Londoners were
ecstatic; on the first day I got a starter,
ramen and a large
juice from Wa-
ga’s for under
a tenner, my
life may have
peaked there
to be honest. It
was a great time
for everybody
in the UK,
we basked in
the 30-degree
summer heat,
people were
out and about,
restaurants and
pubs were open, lockdown must have
ended right? If the government are
literally paying for us to eat out then
surely we must be in the clear? This
may have been true for London; by
its nature, London had a high peak at
the start of the pandemic and quickly
dropped to a more manageable level
but this wasn’t the case for smaller cit-
ies though; these had a smaller initial
peak, but the drop wasn’t as rapid and
cases were sustained for longer.
The government decided to imple-
ment EOTHO to bring money back
into the economy and get the service
sector moving again because the
faster this happened, the faster the UK
could recover from the pandemic; in
principle this is a good idea, we can’t
exactly stay in lockdown until we have
a vaccine, then expect the economy to
be unaffected in the system we operate
in. The reason this scheme may have set
the UK back, according to the Mayor
of Greater Manchester, Andy Burn-
ham, is that it operated strictly on a
London timeline. As soon as London
got to a manageable death rate, they
implemented EOTHO but the smaller
cities like Manchester, Liverpool and
Leeds still didn’t have a stable death
rate so were in a much more precarious
position than London. As a result, the
citizens of these cities ventured out to
pubs and to restaurants and since the
government told them
they were safe,
they slowly let
their COVID
guards down.
People min-
gled and the
virus slowly but
surely started
working its way
through the
population,
leading us to
where we are
now.
There is no
hiding the fact that the North is being
disproportionately affected by the
pandemic; the North East and West
have the highest hospital admissions
per 100,000 and positive/negative test
ratio of anywhere in the UK and it isn’t
just the London-centric management
plan that caused this. If you look at the
variables dictating whether a region
will handle a pandemic such as COV-
ID-19’s well, the North has definitely
drawn the short straw; the North is
poorer, its demographics are more
vulnerable, its people are more likely
to live in urban areas than in rural
and according to the ONS (Office for
National Statistics), its industries force
more people to go out and work as
opposed to working from home. This
cocktail of risk factors predisposes the
North to vulnerability and when the
government doesn’t prioritise this, it
is easy to see why places like Liverpool
have been shoved into Tier 3. It is also
clear that this isn’t a sustainable man-
agement plan.
Two main factors affecting regional
burden of COVID-19 are how urban
the area is and how deprived the area
is. If we look at London, it is almost
100% urban (hence the huge initial rise
in cases) but according to the ONS,
“jobs based in workplaces in London
and the South East are much more
likely to be possible to do from home
compared with the rest of the UK,
probably due to a higher proportion
of professional occupations in the
region”, (hence the rapid, early decline
in cases).
If we look at the rest of the South
as a whole, it is more rural and less
deprived meaning that the burden will
be lower. If we look at the North there
is definitely more deprivation, but this
is okay in rural areas since transmission
is lower but in cities and towns where
the population is urban, COVID-19
can spread rapidly without adequate
intervention, infrastructure and man-
agement to stop it.
If the North-South divide isn’t
addressed, there will always be health,
social and economic inequality and a
large proportion of the population will
not reach their true potential due to
the area they were born in. There are
a lot of problems in the UK and these
are definitely exacerbated by COV-
ID-19 but maybe the silver lining of
this pandemic is that we can highlight
and address the massive inequalities
present in the UK which include but
are by no means limited to the North-
South Divide.
