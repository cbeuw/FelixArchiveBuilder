The world waits with bated breath
for a return to normality, with
many hopes hinged on a coronavirus
vaccine. However, despite current
estimates of a vaccine being approved
by early 2021, distribution can take
months meaning restrictions may not
end until late next year. So why exactly
are we in it for the long haul?
The goal of vaccination is to achieve a
state of herd immunity: where enough
people have gained immunity to a
disease that the disease cannot spread
anymore, and it will eventually die off.
Herd immunity also protects those who
can’t get vaccinated by making it diffi-
cult for a disease to even reach them in
the first place. The proportion of people
that require immunisation for the entire
population to have herd immunity
depends on how effectively a disease
spreads; with COVID-19, this thresh-
old is estimated to be around 60%.
60% of the world’s population is
almost 5 billion people. Getting this
many people vaccinated takes time and
is made even more difficult with many
planes grounded due to lack of passen-
ger air travel, which is one of the main
networks utilised for pharmaceutical
distribution. This is complicated further
by the requirement for the ‘cold chain’:
the logistics network for items that
require refrigeration or freezing. While
the leading vaccine candidate from the
University of Oxford and AstraZeneca
is expected to require simple refriger-
ation, other leading candidates
have higher demands.
Both Pfizer and Mod-
erna are working on vac-
cines that will require
sub-zero storage,
with Pfizer’s
vaccine requir-
ing temper-
atures of
below
-68°C.
This
has logis-
tical conse-
quences; the
transport and
storage of these
vaccines at such low temperatures
is costly and requires specialised
equipment and facilities. Capacity is
lacking not just in the global south, but
also in developed countries like the US
and UK - which are ironically faring
worse in response to the disease than
many countries in the global south.
To this end, private logistics compa-
nies such as DHL and UPS have been
investing in their cold chain capacity,
building high capacity freezer farms in
major cities around the world to house
vaccines for distribution. Meanwhile,
Pfizer have taken it upon themselves
to create a custom transport solution
with cold storage boxes that can
keep up to 5,000 vaccine doses
at the required temperature for
10 days without requiring external
cooling, meaning that regular
distribution networks can be
utilised. This custom solution has
a major advantage: while big cities may
have the necessary cold storage facili-
ties to store tens of thousands of doses,
smaller towns and villages do not. The
challenge then is for those smaller set-
tlements to be able to make use of the
doses quickly before the timer runs out.
It is estimated that while a vaccine
may be approved by early 2021, due to
these logistical challenges the vaccina-
tion program could take several months
to a year. Further investments need to
be made in order to ensure we have the
capability to quickly and safely vacci-
nate the population so we can finally
put this pandemic behind us.
The logistics of vaccine distribution
The effectiveness of contact trac-
ing apps is starting to show, and
it isn’t looking positive. Each week,
the percentage of individuals notified
about a confirmed positive contact has
decreased, which is brings into question
the accuracy of the test and trace sys-
tem. This failure to reach notifications
causes a risk of further transmission
due to a lack of self-isolation. Further,
it defeats the purpose of maintaining
an automated contact tracing scheme in
the first place.
To this end, test and trace informa-
tion has been (on a case-by-case basis)
provided to the police. The belief is
that they would help ensure that those
legally required to self-isolate are indeed
doing so. Failure to meet this legal ob-
ligation may see an individual charged
anywhere from £1000 to £10,000.
Some suggest that this move to hand
data over to the Police might discourage
those looking to take a test, with MPs
raising concerns over how police have
access to the data while local councils
do not.

In order to put an end to the glob-
al coronavirus pandemic, researchers
around the world are working tire-
lessly to develop a vaccine to protect
against COVID-19. While vaccine
production usually takes multiple
years, a coronavirus vaccine is hoped
tobedevelopedwithin12-18months.
Vaccine testing can be split into 5
stages:
Pre-clinical – animal testing to see
whether the vaccine elicits an immune
response.
Phase I – healthy human volunteers
to determine safety and evaluate im-
mune response.
Phase II – hundreds of volunteers to
identify correct dosage.
Phase III – thousands of volunteers
to confirm safety and efficacy vs. a
placebo.
PhaseIV–studiesonadverseeffects,
long-term mmunity and vaccine us-
age following the approval and licens-
ing of the vaccine.
The WHO is currently tracking the
progress of over 170 candidate vac-
cines; at Felix, we’ve chosen 5 of the
most promising candidates to follow,
so watch this space!
New Update: In January, Imperial
College London will be starting hu-
man challenge trials, in which young,
healthy volunteers are deliberately
infected with COVID-19 in order to
assist with the vaccine discovery pro-
cess. AstraZeneca are getting ready to
resrart their US Phase III trial.
