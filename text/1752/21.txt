ENERGY is a mess, a simultaneously
enjoyable and frustrating experi-
ence. To explain why we’re going back
to 2013.
Long ago, in a time when listening to
dance music didn’t seem so depressing,
Disclosure released an absolute slaper-
ooney of a dance album, an instant clas-
sic. Settle launched onto the scene seven
years ago and in one fell swoop the Law-
rence brothers (Guy and Howard) land-
ed themselves into the dance record hall
of fame. Whether they wanted it or not,
Settle was a double-edged sword; setting
the bar unbelievably high. The high bar
ended up being bad for both the broth-
ers and their fans.
While they didn’t shit the bed with
their second project, Caracal, it left a
bitter taste in the mouths of many fans.
Caracal was a pop record, unexpected to
most. We should have seen it coming I
suppose, but I guess that’s easier to say
in hindsight. The Lawrence brothers
had long admitted a love for pop music,
often telling of their affection for artists
like Jamie Woon. After all, it was their
signature sound mixed with traditional
pop song writing that gave many of the
major hits on Settle their widespread
appeal and accessibility (“Latch”, “F For
You”,“HelpMeLoseMyMind”).Unfor-
tunately, their breach into pop territory
was not met with overwhelming praise
from critics.
I mention all of this for two reasons.
One – the Lawrence brothers are actual-
ly fantastic at making pop music (if you
ignore their worst ever song “Magnets”)
and I don’t think they get the credit they
deserve from critics. Two – it helps ex-
plain Disclosure’s very clear return to
their dance style, for better or for worse.
Let’s start off on a positive note. EN-
ERGY has some absolute killer tracks.
“Lavender” is sexy and chique. When
it becomes safe to, you’re going to want
this to get on the dancefloor and engage
in some consensual grinding.
“My High” is Disclosure’s slowthai
banger. Similar to slowthai tracks like
“Doorman” and “Deal Wiv It”, but with
the unique Disclosure sound. This track
is full of tongue’n’cheek lines and has an
infectiously aggressive, on-edge atmos-
phere.
The title track
“ENERGY” is the
crown jewel of this
album. Layers of
percussive rhythms
build until there are
no breaks, the space
around begins to
vibrate, and the air
becomes saturated
with energy (seri-
ously couldn’t think
of a better word).
This is a dance
track through-and-
through, ENERGY
needed so much
moreofwhatthistrackhastooffer.Why
did we only get one track like this??
Besides these top tunes, there are
only two other stand-out tracks that
are worth anyone’s time: “Douha (Mali
Mali)” and “ce n’est pas”. Both are inter-
esting because they are legitimate devel-
opments of Disclosure’s signature style
by using the influence of different cul-
tures. However, they lack the momen-
tum and presence of the best tracks to
really draw attention.
Sadly, the remainder of the tracks on
the album are mediocre. To be fair it’s
probablymoreaccuratetodescribethem
as underwhelming rather than medio-
cre. I’ll let you decide which is worse.
I’m not saying that Disclosure haven’t
tried to develop. All I’m saying is, you
can’t put an extra layer of frosting on a
seven-year-old cake and convince me it’s
not stale. So many tracks on ENERGY
have the same sound as those on Settle
except with added bells and whistles
(both metaphorical and literal in this
case).Tonameafew:“WatchYourStep”,
“Who Knew?”, “Reverie”, and “Birth-
day”.
Actually, “Birthday” is in a class of its
own, and not a good one. “Birthday” is
their new worst song. On first listen, I
legitimately questioned whether or not I
was still a fan of Disclosure. Harsh criti-
cism, but one that I now levy at Kehlani
and Syd. Guys… the lyrics on “Birthday”
are hot garbage.
All I have to say about the two in-
terludes in the album is this: if you’re
going to include an interlude in your
album make sure
it’s both a good
palate cleanser
for the following
track and make
it an interesting
tangent that ap-
pears to develop
ideas or themes
you’re using.
Don’t use it as
an opportuni-
ty to flex your
producing skills
by wedging in a
genre that has no
reason being in
your album *cough* Thinking ’Bout You
*cough*, and don’t make it as boring as
a lo-fi beat compilation *cough* Fractal
*cough*.
Despite the criticisms I’ve hurled at
thisalbumitcannotbesaidthatitisbad.
There are some great highs amongst the
lows, and even the lows can be viewed
differently. As stated before, you could
look at the poorer elements as either me-
diocre or underwhelming, and there’s
a big difference between the two. The
critical reception to this album has been
reasonably varied, most landing it in a
range from 3-5 stars, which is pretty in-
consistent. If this is your first Disclosure
album or you’re not a regular listener,
I’msureyou’rehavingablast,youshould
be. ENERGY is a fun album to listen to.
This album makes me want to throw
some shapes and get back to the dance-
floor (excluding “Birthday” of course).
Though when I do return, I can say with
certainty that I’ll be reaching for a lot of
other albums and not this one.
