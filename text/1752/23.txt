Armand Hammer are an experimen-
talhip-hopduomadeupofELUC
I D (rapper/producer) and Billy Woods
(rapper). Despite taking a year off from
releases in 2019 as a duo, Billy Woods
was working harder than ever, delivering
not one but two conceptually and lyri-
cally tight records. Concerns would be
well founded therefore, as to the ability
and stamina of the pair to come through
with a record as polished as 2018’s Par-
affin. Shrines however delivers a unique
– if unnerving – experience.
Built on saturated, off-kilter drum
loops, grainy samples and a seemingly
unending barrage of cultural references,
the duo conjure apocalyptic worlds on
each of Shrine’s 14 tracks. E L U C I D
and Billy seem to hold musical con-
vention and listenability in contempt,
or at least take pleasure in perverting
them throughout the LP. On ‘Charms’
metallic percussion drops in and out of
the mix over an overblown flute sample
while the pair deliver their intricate
rhyme schemes which blur street smarts
and spirituality “Stark phenomenon,
faith starts when shit stops addin’ up/
Charge it to the game, plus tax just
when you had enough” raps E L U C I
D, later referencing early Christian mys-
ticism and a strange theory that Eve (Of
Genesis) had a sister. The pair’s fascina-
tion with Judeo-Christian mysticism
permeates the record, with references
to obscure philosophies on wealth, time
and rap culture popping up on tracks
like ‘Flava Flav’ and ‘Eucharist’ where
the line “Christianity is cultural appro-
priation” alone is mind blowing, and
gives the album as a whole more sub-
stance for listeners who enjoy through
analyses and obscure theologies.
Elsewhere a range of guest features
including Earl Sweatshirt, R.A.P
Ferreira (formerly Milo),
Akai Solo and more do
well to break up the pairs
focused but cryptic and
dark themes, steering
their tracks onto (rela-
tively) more conventional
themes. R.A.P. Ferreira’s
feature on ‘Dead Cars’
is a particular highlight,
where a more traditional
instrumental ornamented
by childish synth chords
provides a pensive back-
drop for meditations a
decaying culture, which
seems less distant with
each passing day.
Shrines is an alienating listen, but this
is precisely what experimental hip-hop
fans will love it for, with poetic lyrics
and abstract instrumentals, it comes on
like a collage from some meta-cultural
junkyard, a challenge, but a rewarding
one.

Extrawelt are surely one of the good
memories of the minimal era. The
genre’s rise to the zenith of the club
scene was rapid – it was everywhere
from Ibiza to Tokyo. Reading about it
now, the evolution of this throbbing,
clicking artery of club music of the mid-
2000s was quite divergent. Some of it
tried to stay true to the minimal form
that was fighting to stay relevant, while
some tended towards early tech house
and rode the wave of its popularity for
the next decade. In a sense, Extrawelt
sometimes exist somewhere between
the two. In the more uplifting corners
of their discography, the production
tends to be quite progressive, whereas
the essence of their hooks stays quite
minimalist.
There are varying degrees to which you
can strip down a groove for it to still
sound coherent. Still, there are three
main aspects that a good minimal track
needs to obtain that propulsive feeling.
The first is a bas that oozes funk and
needs little to no variation, the second
are percussion samples which sound
like you fed your grandmother’s china
collection through a woodchipper. Last-
ly, and most importantly, the producer
needs a knack for pushing the progres-
sion forward so seamlessly, that only
when the eventual breather just before
the drop comes, you are able to see the
mountain of sound.
The most recent release by Extrawelt
comes on Traum Schalplatten, the min-
imal goliath that now mainly dabbles in
sweet German melodic techno. It kicks
off with Mr. Wednesday, a thumping
bassline which flashes its razory teeth to
varying degrees, always smoothly fore-
shadowing a switch-up in the percus-
sion. The production is excellent, with
the beautiful use of effects being backed
up by the frightening industrial sounds
that the producer duo are known for.
Unfortunately, despite being bouncy as
hell, perfect for some peak time shape
cutting, it could be
perceived as lacking
subtlety.
The title track of the
EP is rhythmically
more interesting. Its
stumbling bassline
segues wonderfully
into the percussive
backbone of the
track, which keeps
up with the pace of
scene changes set
by the opener. The
breakdown is espe-
cially rewarding,
with the bas suddenly disappearing and
leaving the aftertaste of an early morn-
ing at a warehouse rave.
Finally, we have SEM, which is the
most minimal of all the tracks. It’s fast,
decisive, with some unusually delicate,
glassy perc sounds filling the void left by
the oppressive machinegun high hats in
moments of downtime. An output wor-
thy of the duo’s otherworldly moniker.
