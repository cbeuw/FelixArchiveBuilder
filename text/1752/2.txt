In an effort to keep students and staff in-
formed, Imperial College is publishing
daily statistics on the prevalence of coro-
navirus within the university. The “College
COVID-19 status and response” webpage
displays the number of recorded positive
tests on campus in both the past day and
fortnight, as well as general guidance from
both the Government and Faculty. At the
time of writing the cu-
mulative total for the
past 2 weeks was at
most 39, with the ma-
jority of those students
and a quarter report-
ed in the last day. Of
course, these statistics
only take into account
the tests reported to
the College’s contact
tracing hub, and so the true number may
be far higher. A particular worry has been
that the spread may be worse in halls of
residence following multiple outbreaks in
them up and down the country, most nota-
bly (for Imperial) at the RCM.
In order to gauge the veracity of these
fears, we spoke to some of the residents.
A hall senior in Eastside told us that she
was “aware of one positive case” on her
floor - as a result of which the floor is now
self-isolating - but that it was asympto-
matic, and was only discovered because of
her “heavy encouragement” to freshers to
visit the Imperial clinic regardless of how
they felt. She also expressed the worry that
such encouragement was lacking from
other seniors and feels that “College rules
for living in halls aren’t strict enough to
prevent an outbreak”. On the other hand,
a senior in Kemp Porter said that while a
few floors were currently self-isolating,
things seemed OK otherwise, although the
freshers were “frustrated” with the rules.
Everyone we spoke
to also confirmed
that despite some
residents socialising
and partying outside
the allowed bounds,
the majority seems
to be adhering to the
restrictions.
The College is
seemingly aware that
a more targeted approach to managing out-
breaks in halls may be useful. Last week, a
pilot scheme of voluntary testing at Evelyn
Gardens was run with the express purpose
of “estimating the prevalence of asympto-
matic cases” in students and staff on cam-
pus. Pending its success similar programs
may be extended to the rest of Imperial’s
halls, potentially making future statistics
more accurate.

TOTAL FOR THE

Imperial UC team beat Exeter to advance
Calum Drysdale Editor in Chief
Imperial University Challenge team beat
Exeter to go through into the next round
of the competition.
Having lost to Strathclyde University in
the first round Imperial was lucky to get a
chance to redeem themselves, qualifying
for a playoff as one of the “highest scoring
losers”.
In a very close competition on Mon-
day, the match, which was filmed after the
spring lockdown, saw Imperial emerge vic-
torious. Their captain, Michael Kohn was
the driving force of the team, answering
questions correctly on topics as disparate
as Russian literature, German philoso-
phers and ABBA. Kohn provoked contro-
versy for his seemingly dismissive attitude
to the hit song “Does your Mother know?”.
In a nail biting conclusion, the teams
were separated by only five points with
each team buzzing to answer a 10 point-
starter question. Exeter buzzed first but
answered incorrectly followed by Imperial
who also got the answer wrong. The gong
then rang and Imperial squeaked through
into the next round. You can watch Impe-
rial next compete on 2nd
November when
they face St Andrews.
