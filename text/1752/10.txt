We – The Blackett Lab Family –
are a growing collective of UK
based Black physicists. Some 15 years
ago, physics teaching fellow, Dr Mark
Richards, and two physics undergradu-
ates formed a friendship that became a
foundation for mentoring and support
of future Black physicists following
in their footsteps through the famed
Blackett Laboratory. Year after year, as
our group grew in numbers, we became
acutely aware of our unique identity: a
group of Black people with a passion for
physics and positive representations of
the Black community – and with this
awareness came a recognition of our
potential to have real social impact. We
grew from the need for a safe space in
which the handful of Black students in
the physics department could share a
sense of belonging and feel supported
in what is – for many Black students
generally – a profoundly challenging
academic and social environment.
In the US, a similar story transpired
when a group of Black physicists
convened in response to inaction by
the American Physical Society against
discrimination and underrepresenta-
tion. Founded in 1977 at Morgan State
University, the National Society of
Black Physicists (NSBP) today pro-
motes the professional wellbeing of
African American physicists within
the scientific community. It seeks to
develop and support efforts to increase
opportunities for African Americans in
physics – and to in-
crease their num-
bers. In the UK,
The Blackett Lab
Family are unique-
ly placed to work
towards a similar
end. Our mission is
to diversify per-
ceptions of physics
and address under-
representation of
Black people at all
levels in the field.
The three pillars
supporting this
mission are: to represent – giving voice
to an underrepresented group of Black
individuals; to connect – bringing UK
based Black physicists together to form
a community of talent and passion;
and to inspire – ourselves, and others,
regardless of gender, ethnicity, age or
occupation – but particularly the future
generation of Black physicists.
When we came together in a more
official capacity, the potential for The
Blackett Lab Family to have a much
broader impact was clear. We had
a model of social togetherness that
worked successfully at Imperial; scaling
this up to become a national commu-
nity just felt right. As our student and
professional lives
diverged over the
years, it became
more difficult to
arrange link-ups
for so many busy
people.
As the country
went into nation-
al lockdown, we
quickly realised it
gifted us a unique
opportunity to
hang out together
virtually – and
in doing so, we
stumbled upon the mechanism to enact
the national reach we always wanted to
have. Our influence and visibility on so-
cial media quickly took off – and global
events that followed only made our
presence and mission all the more vital.
Racial injustice made its way once again
to the forefront of public consciousness,
impelled by the tragic deaths of Breon-
na Taylor and George Floyd, and the
global uproar decrying systemic racism
swelled to
fever pitch. It
magnified the
urgency of
our work, and
the need to
create a plat-
form to cel-
ebrate Black
positivity at a
time of acute
pressure on
the mental
wellbeing of
Black people.
To date, in
just under six
months, we
are immense-
ly proud to
have con-
nected with Black physicists at multiple
universities across the UK, including
Nottingham, Warwick, Glasgow, and
Edinburgh, and to have inspired allies
in other physics departments to pursue
similar projects that foster and nurture
their Black student population. Our
projects have enabled both social and
educational discourse – online dis-
cussion panels have focused on topics
like Why Representation Matters, and
our Instagram page has facilitated the
recognition and celebration of the work
of UK based Black physicists at Impe-
rial and beyond. Indeed, the physics
department at Imperial have recognised
our work and have set up a page on its
website dedicated to celebrating the
contributions of its Black alumni to
science, education and industry.
We are working on developing further
partnerships and programs that nurture
and support more Black physicists in
the UK, and on continuing to connect
and support the wellbeing of current
students and professionals. In doing
so, we hope to fundamentally diversify
the perception of physics and physi-
cists within the Black community and
the wider scientific community: such
grand ambitions start with The Blackett
Lab Family simply existing. Seeing and
interacting with other people that look
like you, and who share similar experi-
ences to you, is so powerful in fostering
that crucial sense of belonging, and
ultimately, a sense of personal validity –
that “if they can, I can.”
