Hit-Boy Scopes, The Butcher Slices
Album Review
Honestly, before this year, I had
only heard a few Griselda cuts (I
blame Westside Gunn’s adlibs, which
still grate on me a little). Though
I’ve been aware of the trio’s trap-
per-turned-rapper, kings of Buffalo
status, it was only after hearing their
scorching Fire in the Booth earlier this
year that I began to explore their dis-
cography. Considering they’ve released
eight albums between them so far this
year, I figured the group was probably
putting in extra work to capitalise on
the attention the freestyle had garnered.
But taking
a closer
a look at
their dis-
cography,
brothers
Conway
the Ma-
chine and
Westside
Gunn
released
3 albums
in 2019
and 6(!)
albums in
2018 re-
spectively,
and cousin
Benny the
Butcher also put out 3 albums in 2018
– a consistently crazy work rate clearly
runs in their blood. As Benny conveys
throughout this new album, Burden of
Proof, their street lifestyle has clearly
instilled a level of rigour, discipline, and
ambition that can be transferred to hip
hop.
The opening line of the album on the
titular intro track conveys just that:
“Last year was about branding, this
one about expanding”. The track is
immediately head-bobbing: an electric
guitar refrain begins the instrumental
before being swept away by regal horns
and drums. Benny comes with steady,
in-your-face bars before slipping into a
poly-syllabic flow: “…prison phases…de-
cision making…frige-rator…killers wai-
tin…reno-vatin”. The dynamic between
Hit-Boy’s production and Benny’s flow
on this track and others throughout
the album is reminiscent of the chem-
istry Kanye and Pusha T had on 2018’s
DAYTONA – a gold standard when it
comes to modern gangster rap albums.
Across the track list, Hit Boy effectively
blends grandiose drums, ear-catching
synths and dramatic vocal samples in
just the right ratios to paint an appro-
priate backdrop for Benny’s bars. On
‘Sly Green’, where Benny rhymes about
his authenticity compared to trend-rid-
ing rappers claiming street experience,
the drums are larger than life and the
synths are
effer-
vescent.
Faster,
thumping
drums
comple-
ment
skipping,
pensive
synth taps
on ‘Over
the Limit’,
a track
that goes
more bio-
graphical
as Benny
references
the bond
he has with his day ones, ducking the
FBI and the strife that drug dealing put
on his marriage and livelihood.
The mellower instrumentals in the
second half of the album are impressive
too and blend with Benny’s reflective
wisdom to make for great tracks – on
‘New Streets’, sober drums, synths and
piano keys layer a sweet blues vocal sam-
ple as Benny contests the glorification
of a “game [that] come with way more
consequences than jail”. He stresses to
those unfamiliar with the lifestyle that
there’s “two sides, one glamorous, other
scandalous” where finding lessons in
the losses is routine. He reflects further
on his losses, particularly
that of his brother,
on ‘Trade it All’.
Over gooey
synths, stut-
tering drums
and anguished
vocal samples,
he lets us know
what keeps him
grounded when
surrounded by mate-
rial wealth: “…so you can
have it all / If it mean I get my brother
back tomorrow”.
‘Famous’ is a track that comes short
– the looped hollering vocal sample
quickly gets annoying as Benny express-
es, through pretty forgettable bars, how
fame isn’t what he expected. ‘Timeless’
is also disappointing – the instrumental,
which sounds like Street Fighter char-
acter selection menu music, is looped to
the point of boring and Lil Wayne and
Big Sean’s verses are generic. ‘Where
Would I Go’ earlier in the album which
features Rick Ross is a track I’m still
unsure on. The beat starts with a slow,
dreamy vocal sample that goes distorted
and psychedelic as
it gets submerged
by a lumbering
drum and then
a weird synth
jingle, while
Benny rem-
inisces on
how he made
it from “the
concrete”. A better
feature appears on
‘One Way Flight’
where Freddie Gibbs
delivers a short but
witty verse and
a hilarious
hook that
sums up
the pre-
dicta-
bility of masculine toxicity regardless of
wealth: “You gon’ cry in that Toyota or
this Maybach?”.
The last few tracks of the album close it
on a high. On ‘Thank God I Made It’,
a piano-led, pitched up vocal sample
and distorted drum creates a mel-
low, Late Registration-like vibe.
Benny starts his verse with
an homage to his mother
and matured reflections on
the debt he owes her for
making the job of being
a single parent even more
difficult. Through his expe-
riences and losses, he’s come
upon a new level of connection
and devotion to family: “I look in
my nephew eyes and I see my brother
/ Sometimes I gotta look away ‘cause
it hurt so much”. The other two thirds
of Griselda join Benny on ‘War Paint’,
where off-kilter strings and dreamy
wailing make the instrumental sound
like something off an Earl Sweatshirt
project. The final track, ‘Legend’, is one
of the best of the album. Melodic keys
over a shuffling drum make for a warm
but striding backdrop to Benny’s four
tight verses that effectively combine
the braggadocious and reflective vibes
of the album, with a trap drum layer
coming in for alternate verses. “Checks
overgrown, neck boulder stones / Ever
since they said I’m goin’ pro, they said
I’m the next so-and-so” is a catchy pair
of bars if I ever heard one. It’s the com-
bined quality of Benny’s flow, lyrical
attention and raw wisdom – not just
on this track, but across the album
– that make undeniable justifica-
tion for his assertion on the hook:
“Said I’ma be a legend soon, I’m a
legend now”. A legend in current
day hip hop mind you,
not just Buffalo.
