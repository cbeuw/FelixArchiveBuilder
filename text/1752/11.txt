Acouple of years ago when I start-
ed studying Physics, I felt bold
enough to try and predict what the
Nobel prizes would be for in that year.
This autumn, as I was reminded that
the announcement days were right
before me, my first thought was “I hope
there will be some women winning
the prize this year.” Growing up with
Marie Skłodowska-Curie as an absolute
role model, as well as reading about
Maria Goeppert-Mayer in my teenage
years, I’ve always been rooting for more
female Nobel laureates in Physics. I
realised very quickly into my degree
that female role models are sparse – a
fact that almost got me to the point of
quitting the subject altogether. Seeing
that reflected in the lack of diversity
of Nobel laureates year after year was
frankly exhausting.
Then in 2018 came Donna Strickland
winning the Physics prize for her work
on chirped pulse amplification in laser
physics, a mere 55 years after Maria
Goeppert-Mayer. And, in the same
year there was Frances Arnold who was
awarded a prize in Chemistry (after
Physics, the science in which female
laureates are rarest). But this year was
different. Three women
won science prizes,
almost half of all the
science prizes awarded
this year.
Andrea Ghez won
a share of the Physics
prize for her work on
black holes and “the
discovery of a su-
per-massive compact
object at the centre of
our galaxy”. In Chemis-
try, Emmanuelle Char-
pentier and Jennifer
Doudna were the first female-only pair
in history to win a science Nobel prize
for their truly revolutionary develop-
ment of the genome editing method
CRISPR. During their interviews, all
women stated that they hoped that
their achievements in science would
inspire more girls and young women to
go into research. “My wish is that this
will provide a positive message to the
young girls who would like to follow
the path of science, and to show them
that women in science can also have
an impact through the research that
they are performing,” Charpentier told
interviewers.
Göran Hanson, the secretary-general
of the Royal
Swedish Acad-
emy of Sci-
ence, rightly
pointed out
last year that
the Nobel
committees al-
ready make an
effort to diver-
sify the prizes
by reaching
out to a large
number of
universities,
or by hosting Nobel Symposia on other
continents. In 2019, they also explicitly
started to call for nominations taking
into account diversity in gender, geog-
raphy, and topic. However, Hanson’s
position that it is the responsibility of
others to encourage women to go into
science is arguable, considering the
reach of the Nobel prizes extends far
beyond research labs and university
campuses. For many girls, the Nobel
prizes are the biggest piece of science
news that they hear in a year. Seeing
that they are overwhelmingly awarded
to men from Europe and North Amer-
ica can be detrimental not just to how
these girls view science, but also to the
general perception of science in society.
Moreover, a study published last
year by Lunnemann and others clearly
revealed that even the underrepresenta-
tion of women in the natural scienc-
es does not fully explain the gender
inequality that we see in the recogni-
tions of the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences. Quite literally, the labs are
more diverse than the Nobel prizes.
Particularly in the light of the recent
Black Lives Matter protests in the US
and worldwide, it becomes evident that
even with this year’s evolution in the
recognition of women’s achievements,
the Nobel prizes are still a bastion of
inequality. Exactly zero of the over 600
science prize laureates have been Black
researchers, and they have been only
marginally more recognised with the
literature, peace, and economics priz-
es where a total of 13 Black laureates
where awarded. Unless this does not un-
dergo drastic change, the claims of the
Royal Academy to be striving towards
diversity are only empty words.
Finally, while science may be more
diverse than the prizes, it should not be
overlooked that women and researchers
with ethnic minority backgrounds still
face considerable hardships in their
career. Women make up less than 15%
of authors who publish in Nature, and
less than 2% of authors are from Af-
rica, South America or Western Asia.
With citations and published papers as
key metrics for career advancement in
research, this puts women and people
of colour at an immense disadvantage.
They earn less, their papers don’t get
accepted as easily and they are less likely
to hold positions of power. Science has
a systemic diversity problem, and while
this year’s Nobels for Ghez, Charpenti-
er and Doudna are a step in the right
direction, there remains a lot to be done
– by all of us.
