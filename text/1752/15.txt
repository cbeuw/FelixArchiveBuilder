An editorial is where the editor
may abandon objectivity
and revel in opinions pure
and simple. The new Fe-
lix website has launched
and I would be remis
not to tell all read-
ers that it is a beauty.
Felix has long had issues
with its website. We have
stumbled from one interim
home to another, a sofa surfer of the
internet and have always then had to
move on. Finally, Felix has a home that
will last it long into the future. It is a
lovely website. I fell like a tiger parent
who after taking their child to endless
early morning squash practices has just
watched lovely Agatha beat the
kid from down the street in
straight sets. Bliss.
My thanks this week
must be divided in
three. Going from
strength to strength
the science section have
built a team of writers
over one hundred strong
and are putting out beauti-
ful pages week after week. Another
honourable mention goes to Isabelle
Zhang. She is the heart of this news-
paper and keeps us all honest. But top
thanks go to the copyeditors this week.
Often behind the scenes they make the
paper get out on time. Thank you

The Felix Editor on
IA: Doing anything is not
the same as doing something
Imperial Athletes should not have gone
ahead. Everything that I have seen and
heard tells me that the Union was not
ready to introduce such a major change
and their stubbornness will not endear
them to the student body. Despite the
promises being made eventual func-
tionality, we call on Imperial to halt the
roll out of Imperial Athletes and return
purchased membership fees to the
clubs that attracted them.
The actions of the Union betray their
attitudes to student sport. In interview
with DPCS Ross Unwin he spoke with
great feeling and conviction about the
savings in time and effort that the new
scheme would bring students, allowing
them to focus on playing their sport
and not waste time on admin. This is
patronising and should be flagged up.
People join the committees of socie-
ties not only because they want to play
more sport but also because they value
the community and the activity of the
society so much that they are willing to
spend time and effort on making that
club activity available to other mem-
bers. The belief that students should
not assume these positions of respon-
sibility is a kick in the teeth to all the
highly impressive committee members
at Imperial who throw themselves
into their societies in order to give
their members the best time possible.
Time after time the Union forgets that
student led activities are what students
want and top down impositions will be
resented. The independence of sports
clubs is of vital importance and once
lost will be very difficult to get back.
Furthermore, why should large clubs
be the beneficiaries of subsidy, support
and intramural leagues that allow them
to continue playing their sport while
smaller clubs must handle disappearing
membership revenue and being side-
lined. This is rank inequality and the
Union should apologise for it.
Accepting this new scheme is the same
as accepting mediocrity. Time savings
accrued now will be paid back in frus-
tration and bureaucratic inefficiency
once lockdowns begin to ease and clubs
begin stretching their muscles and
wanting to do their own thing.

Statement
of Intent
We here at Felix believe that it is al-
ways in the interests of the students to
know. That cover-up and paternalistic
obfuscation is never right and that
as intelligent people students should
be treated with respect and given the
ability to make up their own minds.
Therefore, I, the Felix Editor, on be-
half of the team promise that:
We will to the best of our abil-
ity tell you the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.
We will keep your confidence
and will only publish something
you say to us if you have explicitly
said that we can.
We will work to expose unfair-
ness and discrimination in all
forms that it takes both at the
College and elsewhere.
We will treat fairly any article
sent to us, regardless of point
of view and do our best to work
with you to prepare it for publi-
cation it in our pages.
