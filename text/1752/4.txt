The Union recently underwent a
strategic overhaul of its staff struc-
ture, resulting in the redundancy of 20
staff members. The restructuring was
prompted by the uncertain and precari-
ous COVID-19 pandemic that rendered
the Union’s commercial services inoper-
able, as well as the declining satisfaction
of bar and kitchen services seen in the
previous academic year.
Social distancing rules enforced since
March have meant that the Union’s com-
mercial services could not operate. The
Union’s catering services, events, bars,
and shops have been closed since the
pandemic reached the UK, with only
FiveSixEight being able to operate in the
foreseeable future, under tighter restric-
tions. The vast majority of commercial
services staff have since been placed on
furlough, with the Union relying on the
government’s Coronavirus Job Reten-
tion Scheme to help cover their monthly
wages. The Job Scheme ends in October;
with the projected 50% drop in retail
revenue for this academic year and with-
out any staffing changes, the Union fore-
casted that it would have a loss of £1.3M
for 2020/21.
The Union has been performing be-
low its financial expectations for the
past two years. Unsuccessful operational
decisions such as Union breakfast and
cutting Freshers’ fortnight events, as well
as the health and safety issues near the
start of the 2019/20 academic year that
forced kitchens to close for around 10
weeks, have resulted in cost issues that
were only exacerbated by the pandemic.
A staff consultation was thereby initiat-
ed on August 4th 2020, concluding on
September 18th, to consider the pro-
posed changes on its staff restructuring
with the end goal of achieving financial
sustainability and better delivering the
services that students want.
The Union originally had 64.9 FTE,
including sabbatical officers with a to-
tal salary bill of £2.726M, including
the averaged 28% add-ons of taxes and
pensions. The restructuring involved
rethinking the Union’s entire staffing
model and shifting the salary balance
from one with a higher proportion spent
on management and oversight roles, to
one that spends
more on roles
delivering the
services.

opportunities
were assessed
in and offered
new roles.
Overall, 20 staff
members have
been made re-
dundant, most
coming from
Commercia l
Services.
The restruc-
turing will
save the Union
around £1.1m
a year in sala-
ry costs, with
£846K from the
removal of posts that were filled, and
£254K from the removal of posts that
were vacant. Positions that have been
abolished in the new structure include:
all Bars and Catering roles other than
the Operations Manager role; the Head
of Communications and Systems role;
the Administration Support Manager
role; the Senior Designer and Market-
ing and Communications Coordinator
roles, which have been combined into
one post; reducing the number of Retail
Assistant roles from 5 to 2 FTE; reduc-
ing the number of Retail Supervisors/
Shift Leaders from 3 to 1 FTE.
Some of the staff who have been made
redundant were furloughed when they
were given noticed and unable to return
to the workplace before their notice pe-
riod ends. Whilst furloughed Union
staff members’ monthly wages were 80%
covered by the government Job Reten-
tion Scheme, the Union committed to
paying the remaining 20%, including for
casual bar staff.
The new staffing structure would also
fulfil the objective of transforming the
student union for the better. Other than
changes in the staff positions available,
changes were also made in line manage-
ment to “streamline” the team. In the
previous structure the 3 main Directo-
rates reporting to the Managing Direc-
tor were Membership Services (student
opportunities, advice and representa-
tion); Communications and Systems;
Commercial Services and Facilities
(licensed trade, catering, bars, events,
conferencing). Under the new staffing
model, the responsibilities of the three
main Directorates have been redistrib-
uted under different line managers and
management groups.

What is FTE?
FTE (full-time equivalent) is a
way for employers to measure how
many equivalents of a full-time
employee work for them, based on
the workload of a full-time employ-
ee. This allows employers with both
full-time and part-time employees
to compare employee numbers.
Suitable Alternative Employ-
ment
Employers are legally required to
offer employees suitable alterna-
tive employment opportunities if
making their position redundant.
Suitable opportunities depend on
the similarity of the alternative po-
sition to their current job, the skills
and abilities required, the terms of
the job offered, and the payment
