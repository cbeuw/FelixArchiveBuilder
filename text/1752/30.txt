Is the Amazon still burning?
We cannot imagine a just and
sustainable future without the
inclusion of all peoples.
Erasure of certain persons due to
their gender non-conformity is not
acceptable. This book explores why
we need to move beyond the gender
binary as a cultural belief which cre-
ates ‘conflict and division’. Gender
non-conforming people face harass-
mentandprejudiceforjustbeing.Our
society demonises those who don’t
conform to either ‘man’ or ‘wom-
an’, and this systemic discrimination
serves to eliminate a minority group.
In this way, gender non-conforming
people are erased from society. For
example, in 2019, the Department of
Justice of the USA announced that
trans and gender non-conforming
workers were not to be protected by
civil rights law.
This book explains the injustic-
es and experiences of being gender
non-conforming and why we need
to go beyond the binary to have jus-
tice and safety for all. I highly recom-
mend this book to everyone no mat-
ter your interests; For some, it may be
education, and for others, it may be
recognition as the author writes, ‘this
book is dedicated to everyone who
has ever been made to feel like they
were too much or never enough’. It is
part of a series by the Pocket Change
Collective to spotlight activists, pub-
lished by Penguin.

During the summer of 2019, there
was a surge of outrage and con-
cern for the fires raging in the Am-
azon, in which 1 million hectares of
forest were burned. There was un-
precedented media coverage on the
issue and social media shares sky-
rocketed like never before. And for
good reason. From the period of Jan-
uary to August (2019) there was a 39%
increase in forest loss than the same
period in 2018. This increase was
likely due to the policy changes Pres-
ident Jair Bolsonaro brought in when
he came to office at the beginning of
2019 (this is the man who has been
quoted saying, ‘Let’s use the riches
that God gave us for the well-being of
our population’ on a visit to the Ama-
zon for a mining project).
The social media mania brought
with it a flux of publicly accessible
environmental education and aware-
ness on Amazonian issues that envi-
ronmentalists and local communities
had been talking about for decades.
Hundreds of celebrities with large
followings urged people to donate to
NGOs supporting the
relief effort, and Inter-
national leaders offered
a relief fund to Brazil of
$22.2 million, express-
ing global concern.
But where did our
concern go? Consider-
ing the lack of rage and
concern this, one may
assume that the Ama-
zon is ok now, and the
fires all went out...
Well, the Amazon is
still burning, and this
year could be worse than the last. Un-
derstandably, this year we have been
preoccupied with other things such
as the global pandemic and the civ-
il rights movement which started in
the USA over the summer. But the
COVID-19 pandemic has hit Indig-
enous communities hard. And this
year could be more damaging and
destructive than the fires of 2019.
Deforestation increased by 51%
in the first three months of this year
compared to last year, soil is drier,
and the temperatures are hotter. To
understand why this is worrying we
need to know how the fires occur in
the first place.
Fires are not a natural occur-
rence in the Amazonian ecosys-
tems. Most fires are caused by
human burning of the remains
of deforested areas; shown by
the satellite images of fire hot-
spots being located next to agricul-
ture, pasture, and roads. Of the area
that was burned in 2019, two thirds
were recently deforested (in the last
few months). More often than not,
land grabbers deforest public lands
to transform it for commercial pur-
poses. Therefore, the focus of policy
change should be on minimising de-
forestation to prevent further trans-
formation of more land into agricul-
ture in the Amazon.
So, the combination of increased
deforestation, drought, and increased
temperatures create the conditions
for more fires, especially from the be-
ginning of the dry season in May.
In June this year, there were 19.6%
more fires in the Brazilian Amazon
than compared to last year, accord-
ing the Professor Marcia Castro of
Harvard University. Additionally, the
numbers of fires have increased in
Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru com-
pared to last year.
It is crucial to highlight here that
when forest is burned and trans-
formed in this way, it may never fully
recover. Since July there has been a
‘ban on forest fires’ in Brazil, yet there
is a lack of enforcement and fires con-
tinue to burn.
This is terrifying. And for the In-
digenous communities of the Am-
azon and areas around it, this is
trauma; more specifically Solastalgia
(anxiety and sorrow from the chang-
es in the natural environment). In-
digenous people are most affected by
the deforestation and fires of the Am-
azon. For many groups, the forest is
their livelihood and their home; fires
and deforestation threaten this. The
air pollution created by fires is also
causing a spike in respiratory prob-
lems, with smoke poisoning becom-
ing more and more common across
Amazonia.
The Amazon is a huge carbon sink,
but it could become a carbon ‘faucet’.
It is our responsibility to reduce harm
and further exploitation of the people
and the ecosystems. We must stand
in solidarity with the In-
digenous people fighting
for their lands and we can
support them through or-
ganisations such as Am-
azon Frontlines. Plus, we
cannot rest on our laurels
and depend on the Ama-
zon to be the ‘lungs of the
earth’. We have the duty to
increase our carbon sink
potential in the UK if we
have any chance of pre-
venting further tempera-
ture rise across the world.
