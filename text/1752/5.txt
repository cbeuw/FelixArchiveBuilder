The new proposed Union staff structure
engaged thoughtfully and profes-
sionally throughout the process” but
that the unfortunate challenges faced
by the organisation compel the pro-
posed restructuring. Flynn joined the
Union as Managing Director in June
as a part-time role, and began work-
ing full-time as Managing Director in
September. He oversaw the staff con-
sultation, which was initiated by the
Union Board of Trustees.
Over the next six months the Un-
ion will be conducting a strategic re-
view of itself in the aims of becom-
ing a more efficient organisation.
Emphasis has been placed on two
key areas. Firstly, transforming com-
mercial services to delivering services
that better align with what students
want. Secondly, increasing the op-
portunities for students to be staffed.
In comparison with other student
unions, Imperial College Union has
relatively little student employment
opportunities. The proportion of
staff salary spent on student staff in
other students unions is close to 50%
whereas at Imperial, before the pan-
demic, it was closer to 20%. Having
increased student employment op-
portunities enhances student devel-
opment and employability, as well as
allows the Union to give money back
to the pockets of its members.
“A strategic overhaul, and con-
sequent staff change, would have
been necessary in the Union almost
irrespective of external circumstanc-
es,” Union President Abhijay Sood
spoke with Felix. “The changes we’ve
made this year will help us remain
financially sustainable, giving us the
space to do the things students want
us to do. They also mean we can hire
more student staff, who generally
have a good understanding of other
students’ needs, and whose terms of
employment we’re currently working
to improve following various officer
manifesto commitments (including
mine).”
