Speaking to Sport Development
Manager James Perry about the
launch has given us more insight on
how Imperial Arhletes is planning on
enhancing the sports experience for
students.
Prior to the launch of Imperial
Athletes, what was a key obstacle
to joining sports at Imperial?
There are a wide range of clubs that are
advertised to freshers from the start of
term with varying memberships fees
offering different activities. With the
high costs of university and living in
London, spending up to the order of
£100 on a sports club membership is a
big commitment and can be daunting,
especially for individuals who aren’t
yet certain which club they want to
dedicate most of their time outside
of their degree to. Furthermore, the
list of different memberships and fee
systems from one club to another can
be off-putting. A key long-term goal
for Imperial Athletes is to make sports
cheaper and more accessible through-
out the entirety of what Imperial has
to offer.
How will the launch of Imperial
Athletes affect the support for
performance athletes?
At the moment, College is running a
scheme to support performance ath-
letes with scholarships, from Bronze to
Gold in accordance with the athlete’s
competition level. These scholarships
provide athlete support, mentoring,
Strength & Conditioning, financial
and training support. This scheme
is led by the College so will not be
changing. Until now however there
was very little support for performance
teams and their entries would usually
be capped. With Imperial Athletes the
aim is to support performance teams,
enter all teams competing at BUCS
Premier, Tier 1 or National champion-
ships and fund transport and accom-
modation for those teams.
Some clubs have managed to find
their place in the structure but
others haven’t. Hhow do you feel
the incorporation of these clubs
will progress in the future?
Imperial Athletes is there as a structure
to support sports clubs. With the ex-
tension of Imperial Athletes to indi-
vidual and martial arts clubs there has
been more work to be done to support
all clubs of the Sports Hub equally.
While we may have underestimated
the variance of functioning across the
range of sports clubs, we appreciate the
challenge that this variety of required
solutions presents and are actively
working on helping all clubs find their
place within Imperial Athletes.
A positive outcome of this transition
is that it has brought many clubs who
felt isolated in the past to feel included
in the sports community and to enter
discussions with Imperial Athletes. The
student activities development team is
motivated to support such clubs and
sees this as an opportunity to help
them take part in development plans.
We know that change is always diffi-
cult, but we are hoping that this can be
a change for the better.

How aware were you before Septem-
ber that the launch of Imperial Ath-
letes was taking place this term?
We had heard of the Sports Hub dur-
ing the year but had received no indica-
tion we were going to be included in it
this year until the week before the start
of term and the Virtual Fair. No one
reached out to us from IA to help us un-
derstand how we fit in, how to organise
our activities for this term and promote
them to new members so we weren’t
quitesurewhatthetermwouldlooklike.
After reaching out to IA we were able to
clarify how the club would fit in within
the scheme and after this delay we have
been able to run our sessions with limit-
ed disruptions due to this transition.
Do you feel like the IA structure bene-
fits your club financially?
Our membership used to be higher than
what is currently a flat fee of £25. Fol-
lowing an increase in riding lesson pric-
es and a reduction in membership cost
we’ve had to reduce our subsidy per les-
son. However in the long term, by work-
ing with IA to optimise the running of
training and competitions, we believe
we can get to a point where the overall
student experience is cheaper.
Do you think IA can work in the long
term for Riding and Polo?
Discussions still need to happen to
know how we are going to work with IA.
Things that are still unclear include the
sources of income: as this is something
IAisgoingtotackletomaketherunning
of clubs easier, we’re hoping this gets re-
solved quickly. As a club that has a lot of
admin work throughout the year, we’re
also hoping the IA structure
will alleviate this stress from
the committee and make the
experience of running the
club less demanding. IA has
made substantial promises to
us and other clubs, and while
we are enthusiastic about the
new opportunities it offers it
remains to be seen whether
they will deliver on these.

When preparations for the Sport Hub
launch were taking place, were you
looking forward to being a part of it?
We joined the Sport sector from Arts &
Ents a few years ago and as the launch
was supposed to take place over 2 years,
we weren’t expecting to be impacted by
it before another year. However we had
doubts about what it could bring to our
clubandstillcan-
not see exactly
what support
Imperial Ath-
letes can bring
us as we simply
don’t have the
same require-
ments to run
our training
and competi-
tions as other
clubs.
When you
were informed
you would be part of IA at the begin-
ning of term, how much support did
you receive to find your place within
the structure?
We were informed very close to the start
of term that we had been moved to IA
and weren’t contacted to help us under-
stand what it meant for us specifically.
When trying to find a way to fit within
the scheme we were given two options:
committing to the Imperial Athletes
structure and receiving some support
down the lineor claiming back the mem-
bership fees and managing our own
finances. No middle-ground solution
seemed to be possible so we decided to
go for the second option and redistrib-
ute the £25 as lessons subsidy.
What were your main concerns for this
term and what are you
hoping will happen in
Winter Term?
Having completed our
financial planning dur-
ing the summer we
were surprised when we
learnt the membership
system had changed. We
felt uneasy charging up-
front £25 to members
to only be able to take
part in online classes.
This contributed to our
choice of opting out of the scheme for
the time being.
We’re hoping we can run our activities
and local competitions next term as
closely as possible to previous years, with
little influence from Imperial Athletes.
