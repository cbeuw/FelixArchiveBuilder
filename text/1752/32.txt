My Favourite Moment in Sports History
There are so many moment in
sports that take your breath
away, that make you marvel at the
human ability, that make you want to
jump in and be a part of, and that make
you completely overwhelmed, some-
times without even knowing why. Any
fantastic sports moment is appreciated
by all people, regardless if they play
the sport or if they even know about
sports. I have many moments that I have
admired, that I remember watching and
feeling so happy that I got the opportu-
nity to even be a part of. But one that
always comes to mind is in basketball,
game 6, NBA final, 2013: Miami Heat
vs San Antonio Spurs. As a little back
story, I started supporting Miami Heat
in 2010, when I was lucky enough to
watch a live game when traveling to the
US. It was a completely surreal experi-
ence for 10 year old me who had started
playing basketball that year. These peo-
ple were huge! They could reach the net
like it was no effort and could cross the
court in seconds when it felt never-end-
ing to me. They had these insane tricks
that they made look so easy. The Heat at
that time also had the “triple threat” –
Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade, and Lebron
James. Every year since then, I’ve sup-
ported them whole heartedly, and was
one of the designated Heat fans among
Lakers and Celtics fans in my school. I
was living in Ukraine at the time of the
game, so I had to wake up at 5am to go
into my living room and set up ESPN.
My family friends stay the night, who
were also Heat fans, and who, luckily,
had the ESPN
subscription.
We had set up
the couch to
turn into a pull
out bed and we
all huddled on
it with bowls of
cereal (eventu-
ally, we would
have to go to
school). I was
so nervous, the
Spurs had been
up the entire
time, always at
least a 1 game
lead, and they
were predicted
to win this game, but we had hope. By
the start of the fourth quarter, however,
we had lost that hope. The Spurs were
up a few points and it just didn’t look
possible for Miami Heat to keep going.
We were all packed and getting ready
for school, disappointed that this will
be a loss for Miami and preparing to
hear all my friends give their “condo-
lences”. The moment came with about 8
seconds left on the clock. Miami Heat
had managed to
get quite close,
scoring many
points throughout
the 4th quarter.
With 8 seconds
left, they were
down 92-95. This
basically meant
they needed one
three pointer to
tie the game and
put them into
over-time. This
was the last play
of the game, and
Lebron James was
going to take the
3-point shot. We
all held our breath as Lebron went up
for the shot. The second it hit the rim
and missed, we all accepted defeat.
Somehow, out of nowhere, Chris Bosh
had gotten the rebound in a sea of Spurs
players and passed it out to Ray Allen.
Ray Allen took a step back and sunk
a three-pointer to tie the game. The
buzzer rang seconds after and the game
went into overtime. We, and the crowd,
went absolutely crazy! At this point, we
still didn’t know if Miami were going to
win the game in overtime, but we knew
that was one of the best basketball plays
we had ever seen. The dread of seeing
Lebron James miss the shot followed
by the completely shock of Ray Allen
making it felt completely surreal. It was
a one-in-a-million chance that it would
have ended like that. In the end, Miami
had managed to win in overtime and
went on to game 7, where they managed
to beat the Spurs and become the 2013
Champions. We all think the thrill and
adrenaline from that shot is what led
them to win overtime and Game 7. It
feels amazing to have been able to watch
a moment in basketball that is still
considered one of the most memorable
events in NBA history.
