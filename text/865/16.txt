P r e s i d e n t — P a u l Shanley
Out, out, out goes that blue pinstripe
look, in comes the casual man at C & A
theme. Paul is wearing a delightful
cityesque stripey shirt divinely com-
plimented by murky blue contact
lenses, to provide that all in one co-
ordinated look. Topping it all is the
Qualcast haircut,
available at B & Q .
Tight blue jeans
pinch in just enough
to provide that sexy
A d r i a n Johnson
stomach overhang,
with the finishing
touch from Millets,
that distinctive tur-
quoise anorak.
Paul's tip: use
F i s o n ' s l a w n
fertiliser for extra
chest hair growth.
Honorary
Secretary—
Murray
Williamson
It's goodbye to that
rag-doll look and
hello to the dynamic
new Murray. The
key word to the new >«
look is 'interesting.' Unfortunately,
Murray went to the same M & S sale as
Mrs Shanley when she made up his
look, but we can't all be original can
we; boys? Murray makes up for this
with his 'back to school' V-neck
jumper. Hand crocheted on behalf of
the 'Guidedogs for the blind' associa-
tion, one can see the difference bet-
ween this and the machine-made mass
market. Topped by his pet hamster,
'Roger,' Murray need never look for
a hairstylist again. Murray carefully
selected his chins from the Reject
Chiner Shop, see how well they hang!
Murray's tip: For that true gormless
look, why not try catching flies on a
Sunday afternoon?
Deputy P r e s i d e n t — J e s s i c a
Rabbit (New Election)
What a bore, darlings! N o change
here—we're going from one sexy
redhead bombshell to another. Still the
same flowing auburn locks, slinky
panty-line and erotic wiggle of the hips
while mooching around the Union Of-
fice. Next year's D P also likes the low-
paid low-cut wet-nurse look; it's
uniforms and domination all the way
for these D P ' s . Strawberry emotion lo-
tion and Wetherheds are the order of
the day it seems! But remember,
sweeties, Jessica is only a temp, you
have a chance to vote for your very
own trend setter in the Union Fashion
Poll, next term.

COSMO Editor—Chris Stapleton
A u revoir to that 'income-support look'
we love to hate and Buenos Dias to a
daring dash of camp fashion! A fervent
supporter of Bisexual rights, Chris has
really taken our breath away with his
oh-so-butch leather motorcycle jacket
at only £105.50 from Eagle Leathers,
a mail-order company of great interest
to leather and rubber enthusiasts. With
his 'come-and-eat-me-up' style white
polo-neck, Chris is fully kitted up for
a leisurely cruise on his bike down
Earls Court Road, that late night
hotspot! But Quel Dommage, what do
we spy underneath all his elegant
finery? Some Black Lycra Cycling
Shorts? A t least they'll go with your
Casio Digital Watch, Chris.
