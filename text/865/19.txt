•Suchard's Romance. £3.99 for
215g (£1.86 per lOOg) from Balfour
News.
'Does not taste like real chocolate' was
a typical comment and it was not
considered poor value for money. The
box was very pink and tacky, the sort
of thing to give to your girlfriend (if
you wanted her to be sick). The
chocolates inside looked nice, but there
were not very many and they did not
taste particularly nice, being rather
sweet and bland. This was the second
most expensive egg and a much higher
standard was expected.

•Cadbury's Milk Tray. £1.55 for
130g (£1.19 per lOOg) from John
Menzies.
The egg was very small but reasonable
value for money, the chocolate was the
same as the Buttons egg. The cream
chocolates inside were 'horrible' but
the rest were enjoyable. This is the sort
of egg to give to your Granny, but hope
she gives you something better.

• M a r k s and Spencer's chocolate
egg. £2.99 for 190g (£1.57 per lOOg).
Very smooth milk chocolate that tasted
nice, but the shell was thin. The box
was very M + S, nicely presented and
could just as well be given to a man or
woman. Eight small creme eggs were
included which were a bit sweet and
gooey but still nice. Everybody agreed
that it was a very good egg both for
taste and value for money. Lovely
chocolate. Positively orgasmic.

loathed. It was not as smooth as the
'Pyramint' but some people preferred
it. There were not many chocolates
included as half of the egg was padded
with tissue paper. There was no box but
it did have a cute yellow bow. It was
very expensive and was not as special
as it should have been. In short, a
rip-off.

•Thornton's Milk Chocolate egg.
£2.75 for 180g (£1.11 per lOOg) from
any branch of Thornton's.
Your egg can be personalised in the
shop at no extra cost to make a very
personal gift. The actual shell was nice
but a bit bland. Nearly everybody liked
it and it was described as 'yummy' and
' m i l k y ' .

•Rowntree's Black Magic. £3.15 for
200g (£1.58 per lOOg) from Balfour
News.
As the name suggests, the chocolate is
dark although it has a mass
consumption taste, not bitter like a dark
chocolate should be. It had a 'liqueur'
taste and the chocolates inside were
reasonable but nothing special. The egg
looked big but because of that the shell
was rather thin.

• T h e C O S M O Egg awards were
given to the following eggs:
Best plain chocolate—Pyramint
Best milk chocolate—M + S
Best value for money—M + S
Best presentation—M+S
Best overall—M + S
The most hated egg—-Suchard's
Romance
Even though the M + S egg won overall
this was due to most people preferring
milk chocolate. The Harrods egg was
of a very poor standard, not what you
would have expected at all. Many
people mistook the M + S for the
Harrod's one.
After the tasting, comments like T
feel i l l ' and T want to puke' abounded
around the office. Some of the eggs
were very sickly, the most notable one
being the Rowntree's Smarties egg.
But the question remains, is
chocolate a sex substitute or is sex a
chocolate substitute?
