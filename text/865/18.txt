• Ever in pursuit of the truth, a
I dozen members of the C O S M O
staff were forced to consume nine
easter eggs so that you will not spend
your grant woefully.
The tests were made blind; each egg
in turn was unwrapped, broken up and
then placed before the ravenous horde.
Each person then wrote down his or her
comments.
In total, nine eggs were tested,
ranging from £1.55 for a Cadbury's
M i l k Tray egg to £7.25 for one from
Harrods. Marks were awarded for the
shell, the contents and the overall
value. Each mark was out of ten and
a cumulative total was given for each
egg. In addition, memorable quotes
made by the staff have been included.
The eggs tested were as follows:-
• Cadbury's Buttons. £2.00 for 180g
(£1.11 per lOOg) from John Menzies.
The chocolate was described as
creamy, and overall nice, although the
shell was quite thin. It was cheap and
the standard of chocolate reflected this.
Not many buttons were included with
the egg and the wrapping looked tacky
and childish. Most people preferred the
chocolate buttons to the shell.

EASTER EGGS Easter is a time for romance,
and what better way for today's
modern girl to assert her independence than an Easter Egg?
• T e r r y ' s Pyramint. £2.99 for 190g
(£1.57 per lOOg) form Balfour News.
The plain chocolate which was strong
and dark with a pleasant bitter taste and
overall was very good. A s for the
contents, everybody agreed that they
were the best of any of the eggs. They
consisted of two small 'Pyramints',
dark chocolate pyramids containing a
minty fondant. The person who first
put mint and chocolate together
deserves a medal, it is the perfect
combination

fflRowntree's Smarties. £1.59 for
190g (£0.84 per lOOg) from
Safeways.
This was by far the cheapest egg weight
for weight and this showed in the
quality, although some people liked its
rich sweet taste. Inside was about 2oz
of Smarties, not very many when you
consider the price of a tube of Smarties.
There was general agreement that the
orange ones did taste different.
Rumours that the blue ones contained
speed were unsubstantiated.
