Goldsmiths-1 IC 1 sts— 1
IC surrendered their Premier Division crown after this
final game of the season but not before handing out
a lesson in disciplined team play to champions-elect
Goldsmiths. Fielding only seven regulars and forced
to play balding ex-skipper Pip Peel at full back, IC were
always going to be under pressure but the admirable
composure shown by the back four, under the
direction of veteran Stu Miller, kept Goldies at bay.
In the first half IC were restricted to a few
speculative efforts and left to soak up long periods
of pressure but they came out after the break
confident of snatching a winner. Then it all went
horribly wrong with a quick break down the left, a
deep cross half-volleyed against the bar, and the
rebound headed home. Momentarily shocked, IC
dusted themselves off and pulled level within five
minutes. The ball appeared to cross the line three
times during a goalmouth scramble before Adam
Thomas forced it in to leave no doubt.
Goldies pressed hard for the winner but could find
no way through. They failed abysmally with the high
ball, succeeding only in furthering Si Holden's claim
to a place in the England line-out for Saturday.
Mention must be made of debut men Alan Sinclair,
Phil Caldwell and especially Chris Ward who all turned
in superb performances.

Barts 2nds-0 IC 6ths-3
The team arrived in Sidcup bathed in glorious
sunshine. Was this perhaps reflected in the quality of
the match we ask ourselves? Well no, not really, and
although the 6ths won their fourth match in a row,
gallant captain Willie was not there to see it. After only
5 minutes, Willie and the opposition's striker
headbutted each other in trying to perform one of
ballet's more difficult pirouettes. They were then
carted off in an ambulance to have stiches, but there
was more to follow as Mitchell skillfully studded the
keeper's chest, badly winding him.
Apart form this, the 6ths dominated the game, led
by Narinda, the stand-in captain, and it was he who
set up Caldwell's first goal with a ball that split the
defence. The second half began as tensely as the first,
but when Sean finished superbly after a surging run,
the game was won. With 10 minutes to go, their
defence somehow let Rob through, and for a minute
we thought he might score, but luckily he sliced it to
Phil who in turn sliced it into the net for his second
and the game's final goal.
Obviously, Willy-John's head injury was worse than
we thought, as we found him wandering aimlessly just
outside the ground, so we poured a few drinks down
him when we got back, and funnily enough he didn't
seem to mind.

Water Polo
'Brilliant' and 'superb' are the only adjectives that
suitably describe the performance of the Ladies Water
Polo team entered by IC Swimming & Water Polo Club
in the National Universities Invitation Water Polo
Tournament held at Liverpool this weekend.
Despite an unfavourable draw and having only
played together as a team for a few weeks our ladies
overcame the challenge mounted by Manchester,
Sheffield, Lancaster, Wales and Bath to finish as
tournament runners-up after a hard fought final
against the impressive team fielded by Liverpool
University.
College club members from St Mary's as well as the
main IC South Ken site formed the backbone of the
team entered under the name 'London Colleges' in
defiance to the players invited to play from other
universities in Town. The squad was trained at IC by
members of the Men's Water Polo Team at the ladies
regular Wednesday evening sessions and coached at
the tournament by 'Big Bad' Dom (Faulkner).
The success of the ladies team is quite remarkable
since many of the players this weekend only took up
the sport when the squad came into existance at the
beginning of this term. And therefore the result is a
clear reflection of the commitment and enthusiasm
shown by all those who turn up regularly for training.
So congratulations to the team and thanks to the
squad's coaches.
It's our annual dinner this Wednesday at which the
awards will be presented. Anyone who's a paid-up
member of the club should attend-7.30pm in
Southside Bar. Bring a guest.
Fencing
Last weekend the U A U individual fencing
championships were held at Bath University. Despite
the incredibly late organisation (entry forms were
received 4 days before the competition) fencers from
all over the country competed. IC, however, could
only muster 2 representatives; top sabreur Jorg Pollok
(who was taking a break from delivering babies in
Hastings) and club captain Dave Matthews, both
competing in the sabre event.
Our fencers made it through the first round with few
problems; there was then a long break while the ladies
sabre was contested. (Liz Clark from St Mary's, who
won the event last year, was unfortunately
unavailable to defend her title). In the second round
pools, Jorg easily made it through to the semi-finals
with 4 victories out of 5. Dave found himself in a very
tough pool and struggled for promotion, eventually
just making it on indicator points.
Unfortunately for Jorg, the two perennial spectres
of sabre fencing-bad judging and bad presiding—
reared their ugly heads and to everyone's
astonishment he was knocked out in the semi-finals
with one solitary victory. However, in a sublime
metamorphosis of his previous performance Dave
cruised into the final, gaining four victories with a
combination of blistering fleche attacks and solid
parry-riposte sequences.
In the final (a pool of 6) the pace increased again.
Dave ended up in 5th place with 2 victories, narrowly
missing another bout on sword points which would
have put him in the bronze medal position. He did,
however, have the consolation of having beaten the
eventual winner (Nick Fletcher of Bristol) in the semi-
final pool.
