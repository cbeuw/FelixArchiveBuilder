You have been thrust into the
limelight at a late stage in
your drinking life. People
will forget the time you were banned
from the college Christmas dinner after
you hurled food from one table to
another. Few people will even know
about your 'Shan's Y e r M a n , '
campaign for Deputy President in
1985-86, when your proposer said of
you 'Shan is the sort of
bloke whose mother denies
all knowledge of knowing
him.' Put the past behind
you and try to forget. If you start
slowly on the drink problem, you
should find yourself able to drink more
before becoming ill. If you want a form
of aversion therapy you may consider
writing to the 'Drinking too much
shrinks your willy' self-help campaign.
They have years of experience and can
provide scientific evidence which may
frighten you away from drink for good.
Your girlfriend may consider helping
you, if you can persuade her to join the
group as well. Y o u are a twentieth
century, liberated man with a job to
fulfil. Don't let a little problem like this
take over your life. Be horny and eat
more fruit.
Q
l am 19 years old and I am
beginning to get worried
about a bad habit I have
developed. I have had the
problem since the age of 1 3 . I
am only 5 ' 2 " high and I have a
s e v e r e p r o b l e m w i t h my
eyesight. I would sign this letter
but the hairs on my palms have
clogged up the pen.
Dear, oh dear, we do have
a problem, don't we? A lot
of people believe that
working too hard can produce these
symptoms. Many people in high
pressure jobs work far too hard, and
gain a reputation for being real
workers. The problem is especially
prevalent in merchant banking and
accountancy. Many a balance sheet has
been smudged by the odd stray hair on
the palm. M y advice to you is to take
things easy for a while.
Q
l am 19 years old and I
enjoy piercing my skin
w i t h r e d - h o t m e a t
s k e w e r s . I've been
involved in a few pineapple and
grapefruit sessions, but they
left me with a distinct limp. I
read the Music pages every
week and I know how horny they
really are. After a friend told me
about your agony column I
thought I would a s k for advice
on some agony outside my
present social circles. Please,
please, please let me know the
true path towards an agony
column.
Wow! I mean how horny.
These scallies know how to
slam don't they. I suggest a
little moshed banana. A l l the
(illegibleâ€”TS) were slamming the
scallies into the fierce moshed banana
last time I went to the gig of the week.
Come along and I'll help you throw
yourself on stage. Birdsnest are playing
in my back room next week, so come
along for some serious moshing.
Spurred on by the mad frenzy of horny
guitar sounds, you will be slammed to
the sweatbox full of flapping flares. If
all else fails, try a Telescope or a bit
of Fella de Sea.
Q
l have just been elected as
a s t u d e n t n e w s p a p e r
editor. I thought the job
would be excellent, but
now I no better.The worry of not
being able to spell has started to
take its toll. For years, my
friends casually referred to me
as 'baldy' but I'm beginning to
think they're right. The problem
has developed beyond a joke.
Although shaving has always
played a paragon part of my
sabre-toothed life, I have lost
the knack of knowing where to
stop. My epee of a razor has
been blunted by this velvet
satire. Without your help I'll be
faxed.
Why oh why did you stand,
if you had such fears over
your spelling? If you let these
fears trouble you, you'll end up as
policeman, who retires to become a
security officer. Hair loss is just a part
of life. Many women even find bald
men attractive. Why not make a feature
of it? A brief shine with a proprietory
brand of beeswax can make you stand
out in a crowd. If all else fails, try
slamming your head into a moshed
banana. In the meantime, why not get
involved in a local self-help group, like
'I don't want to be bald by 30,' a
nationwide group w h o supply
comforting advice on hairpieces and
hats. Y o u r local branch can be
contacted c/o Ian Froth, Children's
Television, Cheapskate.
