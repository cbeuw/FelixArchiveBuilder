Letters to the editor
The first batch of complaints have hit our inbox, driven mainly
by the ex-editor’s letter and the slightly snappy response
Dear Editor,
I was a bit disappointed to read
your reply to Rupert Neate’s letter
in the last Felix. Okay, his letter was
rather confrontational, and indeed
some lesser editors would probably
not have had the balls to publish it,
but I take issue with your comment
that your editorial was “backed up
by the opinion of the general Col-
lege population”. In fact, pretty
much everyone I know in College
thinks that this year’s Felix has by
and large been less interesting and
enjoyable to read than last year’s.
Possibly this is due to us only hav-
ing seen the first few issues, but
there is an almost universal opinion
amongst Felix-readers that whilst
this year’s may on the whole be
better written, with fewer spelling
mistakes and grammatical errors,
it is simply less interesting and
entertaining than last year’s Felix.
The news doesn’t seem very press-
ing, possibly because there’s not
much about, but more importantly
the rest of the newspaper just takes
itself too seriously and does not re-
ally have any light-hearted, ‘enjoy-
able’ stuff in, perhaps forgetting
that it is a student newspaper and
not the Financial Times.
My opinion is that you can only
aim as high, culturally, as the qual-
ity of your writing can allow and un-
fortunately, due to the nature of our
university, writers of quality con-
tent are in short supply, so aiming
too high culturally can easily result
in ending up being plain boring.
Regards,
Chris Thomas
PS I won’t be too surprised if you
don’t publish any of this letter, but
I hope you take the opinion on
board.
We liked the
old Felix better
Dear Editor,
I feel compelled to write to you
about your response to Rupert
Neate’s letter (Page 8, Felix 1361).
The comment that your previ-
ous editorial about last year’s Fe-
lix “backed up the feelings of the
general population of the college”
seems completely at odds with my
own experiences. As a fourth year
student, I can say that Felix under
Mr Neate was a far more entertain-
ing read than it had been previous-
ly. Furthermore, I have yet to speak
to anyone who disagrees with this
sentiment. In contrast, I am some-
what unimpressed this year with
front page stories about your own
graduation.
I’m sure it’s too early in the year
to judge your own editorial skills,
but it would be a good idea to learn
from your predecessors success
rather than to belittle it.
Regards,
John Lyle

Dear Chris and John,
Of course I’d print your letter, Chris;
it is not in my interest to censor bad
feeling about the newspaper.
As all the letters about my re-
sponse were negative, I will admit
that my viewpoint seems to be in
the minority. I, of course, saw things
from a different angle, working for
the newspaper and having been
involved in Felix for many years. I
admire Rupert’s courage in taking
on both the College and the Union,
but I believe on several occasions
he far overstepped the mark. Many
students did not know what hap-
pened behind the scenes, such the
dissatisfaction within the editorial
team about the editor’s manage-
ment style.
You do go on to make a counter-
statement that is as broadly sweep-
ing as my own. In my defence, I’ve
had a number of people approach
me and say they’re enjoying the
paper more now than previously,
and a number approach me and say
the exact opposite. I think and hope
that we’re slowly improving; I was
still recruiting team members until
recently.
To deal with your second point
about entertaining content - I un-
fortunately lost the beloved Hoff
this year, as he has graduated, and
his replacement hasn’t been able
to work due to excessive commit-
ments. I’m working hard to restore
something on a par with the Hoff,
even if it isn’t outwardly visible. As
the new staff grow more confident,
so their sections become more
interesting.
As to the graduation photo story,
well, I didn’t do it. I was, obviously,
graduating as the paper was coming
out, so I handed over what I could to
my deputy editors. When I finished
the front page on Wednesday, it
was the Tibetan protest outside the
hotel in Kensington High Street.
When I returned on Thursday, it
had changed to a photo of myself
looking like a complete moron.
The news in College and the Un-
ion has been somewhat slow of late,
as I’m sure you’ve noticed; there’s
not much I can do about that, I’m
afraid.
What really riles me, and what
Chris has pointed out, is that I am
not responsible for the content of
the newspaper even though I am
generally held to account for it.
My entire life is spent in the office,
more or less, but I cannot write eve-
rything. The bottom line is: you pro-
vide the content. If you’re not happy
with something, come and speak to
me. I’m always ready to hear new
ideas.
As for the comment about learn-
ing from my predecessors - that is
exactly what I’ve done. I’ve been
involved long enough, and seen
four editors come and go, to pick up
knowledge and skills.
I hope you find this issue more
enjoyable.
Do you have an
opinion about
Felix in general,
or do you have a
grievience that you
wish to air?
