Not many people would deliberate-
ly buy an all-in-one games compila-
tion for the Nintendo DS, so that’s
why we’ve done it for you.
Nintendo’s 42 All-Time Classics is
a collection of famous and not-so-
famous games from Chess to Old
Maid, Chinese Checkers to Koi Koi,
and Darts to Soda Shake, where
players take it in turns to shake a
virtual soda bottle and the one shak-
ing it when the top flies off, loses.
It’s important to point out at this
stage that 42 All-time Classics is a
strictly multiplayer affair. The sin-
gle-player portion is so lifeless and
staid that to endeavour your way
through will simply force you to
play games you wouldn’t normally
have tried and maybe find some
hidden gems, as well as unlock-
ing new games for your choices
in multiplayer. The main single
player game, Stamp, runs through
each game one-by-one giving three
stamps for a top performance and
one for a poor performance. Each
game requires three stamps to
continue and, handily, if you hap-
pen to get more than three on a
particular game, then they do carry
over. It shows that even if you come
last that you get a stamp that Nin-

Is Valve’s Steam platform the future of digital distribution? Should we be concerned?

not to be.
The other single-player game,
called “Mission”, is a far more flex-
ible idea, which has an element of
Crazy Taxi’s mini-games about it.
Each game is given a goal, which
can be forgivingly easy or hor-
rifically hard, for example, Hearts
requires you to Shoot The Moon,
whereas Dots & Boxes requires
you to capture all boxes, a fiendish
task in comparison. This mode is
much more welcoming but still has
the main flaw that it is intolerably
dull. You’d be better off honing your
poker skills in real life. Your reward
for completing these tasks is a new
icon, which you can use to repre-
sent yourself over a network. This
brings me on to the multiplayer…
The multiplayer is where the
game shines and for this I give it
8/10. The interface is easily navi-
gable and there is something for
every mood from hyperactivity
(such as Spit) to relaxed sedation
(Checkers). Up to eight friends can
play on one cartridge with little lag
and means that although many var-
iations are more fun when played
with the actual board or playing
cards, you’d be hard-pressed to find
them all together in such an acces-
sible package, assuming you have
at least one other friend with a DS.
The other feature is internet-con-
nectivity. If you have a compatible
wireless router in your house (any
AOSS works), you can connect and
find other games that are being
played on the Internet with abso-
lutely no extra components or soft-
ware. Unfortunately, I was unable
to test this as ours was not compat-
ible but I would primarily use this
game to play friends I could see and
hear, the Internet play would most
likely be of side interest.
The Hearts card game - playable
tendo don’t want you to linger on a
game you don’t like for too long, but
that’s part of the problem. I despise
“Cheat” and to be forced to play it
with the computer for 3 games in
a row is my idea of hell. The option
to skip a particular game would’ve
been nice, perhaps one skip per lev-
el could’ve been allowed but it was

Steam is an online games distribu-
tion network developed by Valve,
makers of the Half-Life series. Be-
fore Steam was created, Valve re-
lied on WON (World Opponent Net-
work) to run its multiplayer games
and distribute patches. In 2001
Valve acquired WON and began
building Steam. The first version of
Steam was available for download
in 2002 during the beta test of Coun-
ter- Strike 1.4. With the release of
Counter-Strike 1.5 users of Steam
and WON could play together on
the same servers. Once enough
testing was done, Valve shut down
the last WON servers in 2004 and
Steam took over.
When Valve announced that they
would distribute their sequel, Half-
Life 2, through Steam, many were
doubtful that it could work because
of the amount of bandwidth needed
to send an entire game over the In-
ternet. However Valve had created
a strong network which used peer-
to-peer technology and the online
release of Half-Life 2 was mostly
successful. This was the beginning
of online games distribution.
Independent developers Introver-
sion were able to reach millions of
gamers around the world by selling
their games Darwinia and more re-
cently Defcon through Steam. This
has allowed the bedroom coders to
save money on distribution and to
sell their games at a lower price by
cutting out the middle man. Online
distribution provides a more level
playing field for developers and al-
lows even small studios to become
successful.
Big game publishers are also us-
ing Steam. Recently, 2K Games and
Activision have signed contracts
with Valve to distribute their games
through Steam. This makes the
Civilization and Call of Duty series
available on Steam. Other publish-
ers are likely to follow and Steam’s
control of the games distribution
market will increase.
Steam has begun influencing
game design as well. Valve have
begun releasing small episodes of
games such as their own Half-Life
2 Episodes and the SiN Episodes by
Ritual. The episode system allows
you to buy a part of the game for
less money than the whole game
and then if you enjoy it, you can buy
the next part. This will probably
happen more often in the future as
games companies find it increas-
ingly harder to come up with new
ideas for games.
As Steam continues to grow secu-
rity becomes an issue. When Half-
Life 2 was released on Steam there
were several hacks which could cir-
cumvent Steam and allow users to
download the games for free. Since
then Valve has rewritten Steam’s
authentication system and claims
that users cannot play a game on
Steam if they did not legitimately
buy it. However the authentication
servers go down sometimes. An-
other problem faced by Steam is us-
ers who steal account information.
Valve needs to make Steam more
secure if it wants to attract more
publishers to use it.
Currently Steam only accepts
credit cards to purchase games
and this limits who can buy games.
However they are working on al-
lowing PayPal and wire transfer
as alternate methods of payment.
This introduces the problem of age
verification.
Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo
are creating similar distribution
systems for their PS3, Xbox 360
and Wii consoles respectively. Sony
has launched the Electronic Dis-
tribution Initiative to offer games
on the PS3. Microsoft is expand-
ing its Xbox Live services to offer
more content. Nintendo is creating
the Wii Compact Software line of
games which can be downloaded
through the Wii. Valve is working
on the third version of its Steam cli-
ent which will manage connections
better and feature an improved
Friends chat client.
Clearly online distribution is the
future of the games industry and
traditional retailers will have to
adapt.
Half-Life 2’s G-Man. A metaphor for corporate heartlessness, or
merely a warning to wearers of bad ties? “Wake up, Mr Freeman.”
Neverwinter Nights finally returns
to game shelves this week with it’s
sequel, looking to bring the technol-
ogies firmly up to date, providing
the average player with an engag-
ing single-player experience as well
as opening up the toolset for more
natural, customisable module crea-
tion. NWN2 is almost certain to be
one of Christmas’ biggest releases
for the PC.
And speaking of dependable fran-
chises, this week also sees the re-
turn of Sam Fisher to PC and in lim-
ited edition form on the Xbox 360.
Splinter Cell: Double Agent is the
fourth in the stealthy franchise, and
the series certainly seems to have
stopped dragging its heels after
a pretty samey third incarnation.
Double Agent is darker, slicker and
seems more streamlined than it’s
previous outings. An interesting
change of pace for Tom Clancy’s
finest.
Or maybe you’re feeling a bit
different this week? Desperate
Housewives gets a much-needed
gaming conversion. Felix Games
only has this advice to offer you
– it’s been released near a holiday
involving fires for a reason.
Things have been quiet on the
Grand Theft Auto front for most
gamers, but PSP owners can pick
up a second dose of vehicular thiev-
ery this week with the release of
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Sto-
ries. If you weren’t enthused by the
previous PSP title, Liberty City Sto-
ries, then don’t expect to be blown
away here, but the series has been
updated with features like empire
building. Most gamers may just
wish to wait for the next-gen GTA.
If you’re feeling sporty, and
wouldn’t mind burning off a few
calories, then Eyetoy Play: Sports
comes out this week too. With each
edition of the Play series, SCE Lon-
don learn more about their ingen-
ious toy. If you can’t wait for the Wii
to get some crazy peripheral action,
Sports is worth a look. If you’re feel-
ing like something less strenuous,
however, then you might prefer to
take a look at FIFA Manager 07.
Even with the controversy sur-
rounding the breaking up of the
Champ Man franchise, you may
find that FIFA is the weaker of the
two.
Next week: Call of Duty 3, Medi-
eval 2: Total War and Pro Evo 6.
