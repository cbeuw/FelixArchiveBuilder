Eat lard, climb hard, and don’t fall!
France, a country loved by some,
not so much by others. Its most
redeeming feature in any rock
climber’s eyes is the huge variety
and quantity of climbing it offers,
all within low-cost airline fares. It
was for this reason, despite some
people’s misgivings, that I bought
a plane ticket to Marseille and set
off with the Mountaineering Club
to the Verdon Gorge for this year’s
summer tour.
The Verdon is a river running
through the Alpes-des-Haute-Pro-
vence in South-Eastern France. It
has cut over thousands of years a
three hundred metre deep gorge,
creating seemingly endless lime-
stone walls that provide some of
the world’s most spectacular multi-
pitch sport climbing. To explain the
jargon, ‘sport’ is a type of climb-
ing where you clip into small bolts
as you ascend which are already
drilled and cemented into the rock.
This allows safe, rapid climbs and
is used widely in Europe, but is rare
in the UK where a traditional ethos
dictates that all protection should
be carried with you. This is in the
form of various shaped bits of metal
called ‘gear’ which can be jammed
into cracks on the way up and re-
moved afterwards so as not to dam-
age the rock. Multi-pitch refers to
the length of the climb. When the
route is longer than your rope, you
stop, anchor yourself to a ledge and
bring up your climbing partner be-
fore setting off again.
We arrived eager to test our mul-
ti-pitch skills (and nerves) only to
discover the necessary guidebook
was out of print! Luckily for us the
owner of the local climbing shop,
Sabine, was able to step in and act
as a human route guide. As far as
we could tell she has climbed pretty
much every route in the area, knew
everywhere off by heart, often even
better than the book itself. Needless
to say, due to the personalised route
descriptions, presents and bags of
sweets she gave us, more than one
of us fell for the eccentric old lady in
the climbing shop.
Something even Sabine could not
reassure us of was how to escape
the gorge in the event of things
not going to plan. The river valley
is only accessible at ground level
from the lake, about a ten mile hike
and swim from the climbs them-
selves! The only easy way to the
bottom of the climbs was from the
top of the gorge. To reach them you
have to abseil down, taking your
rope – the only escape – with you. If
you can’t climb out, it is a very long
walk along and up the gorge to safe-
ty. Add to this the risk of the dam
sluice gates being opened without
warning, made the bottom of the
gorge a fairly inhospitable place!
Curious to discover this for our-
selves, we rented canoes and set off
up the river. A few miles upstream
the narrowing of the channel re-
sulted in tempting white water. Ob-
viously we had to test our rafting
skills, but predictably these weren’t
quite up to scratch and the canoe
was upside down, with Henry’s shirt
floating fast downstream (or so he
says). Nevertheless, in his topless,
soaked state he managed to hitch-
hike back home (being picked up
in record time). As a female friend
recently informed me “wet muscles
are irresistible”.
This trip was certainly one to re-
member, but Verdon has not been
our only excursion of the year; club
members have climbed in Yosemite,
the Alps, Italy, Lofoten, Sardinia,
Fontainebleau, Utah, Kazahkstan,
Frankenjura, Croatia, and the Red
Rocks. Even in England the sun is
known to shine occasionally, and
throughout the year we have fort-
nightly trips to locations all over the
UK. These are not only a chance
to practice climbing skills, but an
excuse to escape London for the
weekend. We have just returned
from this year’s fantastic Freshers’
Trip to the Peak District, for which
we took over thirty members!
Above all, our club is about en-
couraging newcomers and teaching
them to climb. For a taster, meet us
in the union quad at 1pm on any
Wednesday and we will take you
to the Westway Centre, one of the
UK’s largest indoor climbing walls.
There we will teach you the basics
of climbing and rope work before
you join us on one of our outdoor
trips, where you will inevitably get
hooked on climbing for life.

In my first year, I was amazed
that university venues like King’s
College were putting on brilliant
gigs such as the first UK show
with The Arcade Fire performing.
What amazed me was that our
union barely had any live music
in comparison. There was little
variety for someone like me who
likes music that is a bit different.
People who shared my opinion
didn’t feel proud of their union, or
maybe not pride but people were
passionless. When people aren’t
passionate about something, a
sense of community is not there
since there is no purpose for one
to exist.
Taking into account both of
these things, I took over the es-
teemed position of President of
the Alternative Music Society
last academic year (I took over
from the god amongst men that
is James Millen). One of my aims
was to create a community at Im-
perial of people who appreciated
music and I needed a focal point
for this. Thus, I created Kids Will
Be Skeletons, our regular gig
night where we charge the mini-
mum entry possible. I started off
with little experience of promot-
ing and took quite an amateur
approach. Our first night was
chaotic but inevitably fun. It was
brilliant that people were actually
being bothered about the union
and actually wanted to go there
to see some underground music.
Imperial is notorious for its
apathy and naturally some nights
not many people have turned up.
This can be disheartening but we
go on nevertheless because we
want to constantly provide a live
music outlet at Imperial. Our 21st
October night with a band from
San Francisco, Citizens Here and
Abroad was our most popular
night ever.
It was great and we hope to con-
tinue our success with our next
night on November 5th in dBs at
7:30pm. We have two bands from
France called Gatechien and Le
Singe Blanc and a band from
London called Man Aubergine.
We are charging £3 for students,
not to make money but so that
we can pay the bands’ transport
from France.
We don’t stand to make money
but because our society does not
have that much money so we
have to charge entry. We will be
running free nights when we can.
Please come down for a drink and
some great music so we can cre-
ate a great atmosphere.
