Brian May: BSc, CBE, PhD?
Brian May returns to the studio
to work on new album? That’s not
especially newsworthy. But Brian
May returns to Imperial to work on
PhD? Now, there’s a scoop! Tape
recorder in hand, I phoned Brian
for a chat.
Long before Queen, Brian had de-
veloped a great passion for astron-
omy. He chats to me about zodiacal
light; “A beautiful light you can see
just after sunset if you’re lucky and
you live in the tropics.” This, then,
was the subject of his PhD. “Most
people think it’s due to dust in the
solar system that’s scattering the
light. People were wondering where
the dust came from and there was
the inkling of the idea that it might
be something to do with
the way that the solar
system was formed.
It was an object of
great interest
at the time.”
The time in
question,
the late
1960s;

This is a beautiful coffee-table
size book, filled with gorgeous
photographs of the universe
and elegant explanations of
the state of our knowledge
about the cosmos, its origins
and its future.
Divided into seven chapters,
it tells the biography of the
universe, sidling through the
beginning of light, the uni-
verse’s evolution, the forma-
tion of stars and planets and
the emergence of life. The
final chapters look into the
future and to the anticipated
end of the universe.
The text is accessible and
engaging without coming
across as dumbed down. It is
aimed at a non-scientific audi-
ence and includes as asides
(in ‘grey areas’) explanations
of the Kelvin temperature
scale and other concepts that
might be unfamiliar to a non-
Imperial student.
Like bonus tracks on a CD,
after chapter 7 we come to
more fascinating information.
Tips for getting into practi-
cal astronomy and guides
to the night sky help you go
further; biographies of sixteen
astronomers and physicists,
whose research has led to our
current understanding of the
universe.
What is unlear is who wrote
what parts of the book. An en-
tire section is dedicated to the
biographies and achievements
of astrophysicists - it would
have been nice to know each
of the author’s own contribu-
tions.There’s a Bang! website

my home county. Back to the 1960s
Imperial music scene, Brian is soon
on more familiar ground. “Well,
Jimi Hendrix… that was a great
coup. He was playing in the Great
Hall. We sold 1000 tickets!”
Brian’s own music career took off
at around this time. One of his early
groups, 1984, supported Jimi’s Im-
perial gig, “If you could call it sup-
porting!” says Brian, bashfully. Lat-
er, an early ancestor of Queen was
to have its first rehearsal in a room
somewhere behind the Great Hall.
“In those days it was called the Jazz
Club Room. I rented it for a couple
of days and that’s where Roger and
I first played.” This being Queen
drummer Roger Taylor, then a stu-
dent at London Hospital Medical
College. “So, Roger turned up and
set up his drum kit and started tun-
ing them and I was quite amazed.
I’d never seen anyone tuning drums
before,” recalls Brian, used to the
hit-it-and-hope approach of most
rock drummers. “He tuned them
in the most amazing way so
they all started to blend
together. I was absolutely
stunned.”
Brian and Roger, with
their friend Tim Staffell,
played under the name
Smile. But within a
short space of time
the band line-up
had changed to
include Freddie
Mercury on piano
and vocals, and
John Deacon on
bass. Queen was
born and Brian
began to drift
away from his as-
tronomy research.
I wonder if he
ever considered
quitting the band
for academia? “I
think I was slightly
discouraged with
academic life be-
cause my supervi-
sor was raising
so many issues
about the thesis,
saying ‘write a
bit more, write
a bit more’. I
got to the point
where I thought:
graduate from the Physics depart-
ment, was deeply involved in post-
graduate academic life at Imperial.
What was life like for an Impe-
rial student in those halcyon days?
“Well, a lot of hard work,” Brian
admits. Some things never change.
But this was the world of Swinging
London, and Imperial saw its fair
share of action. “It was a fantastic
time to be around musically,” he
recalls, “I was on the entertain-
ments committee and we booked a
lot of great groups: Spooky Tooth,
for instance.” I maintain a polite si-
lence. But a Wikipedia search later
reveals this group to be noteworthy
for its Cumbrian origins, greatly in-
creasing the rock credentials of
Colin Barras chats to the Queen legend about his new book, Jimi Hendrix jamming
in the Great Hall and his return to Imperial to finish the most overdue thesis ever
I can’t do this any more!” This is
probably a familiar story for many
going through the PhD process.
Brian decided to give up the re-
search entirely, and soon Queen
had released their first album. The
rest, as Brian jokingly agrees with
me, is rock and roll history.
But, while you can take the stu-
dent out of academia, you can’t take
academia out of the student. Brian
continued to be fascinated with
things astronomical and ultimately
developed a close friendship with
Patrick Moore, astronomer and
populariser of science. Patrick is
one of Brian’s co-authors on Bang!
The Complete History of the Uni-
verse, published earlier this month.
The book claims to be a readable ac-
count of astronomy. Is this a direct
reference to the work of Stephen
Hawking, famously an author
whose books are bought but seldom
read? “We have boundless respect
for Stephen Hawking,” Brian says,
“but I personally found A Brief His-
tory of Time a difficult book. A lot
of people who are deep into their
disciplines don’t realise how simple
things have to be before a normal
person can understand them.”
The science communicator’s job
is a tough one, as Brian concedes,
“There’s this fine line you walk. You
don’t want to sacrifice major con-
cepts but you don’t want to get deep
into problems that people can’t fol-
low.” He has in mind one area of un-
derstanding that remains baffling
to the non-scientist. “I think very
often it’s the maths that puts peo-
ple off. I personally love maths, but
a lot of people get an instant block
when they see an integral sign.”
But Brian’s interest in science
communication goes beyond this.
“In many disciplines you’re wres-
tling with a problem in one small
area and the problem could already
have been solved in another area
and you wouldn’t know about it.” To
help the spread of scientific knowl-
edge even within the science com-
munity, the authors of Bang! have
set up a website, www.banguni-
verse.com. “I encourage everyone
to visit. We’re hoping it will develop
over the next few months as an or-
gan of interaction.”
This newly re-kindled passion for
astronomy has encouraged Brian
to finish that PhD he began almost
40 years ago. Surely this is one of
the longest running PhDs ever? “I
know! It’s going to be a record!” he
jokes. “I’ve been in touch with Pro-
fessor Rowan Robinson, who’s
the head of astrophysics,
and he’s very kindly of-
fered me a desk and
computer.” Brian has
already been down to
“re-recce” Imperial.
I ask him if much has
changed. “The big sur-
prise was trees in Beit
Quad! There was nothing
there when I was a stu-
dent. You guys have done a
good job making it into an
area that can be used and
enjoyed. And with tables
where you can sit and have
a beer!”
He may be older and wis-
er, but Brian is beginning to
think like a student again.
Isn’t it wonderful?
