Musically, this is pretty standard,
but very well done, electro-fare.
Carefully considered vintage synths
layer a sparse aural landscape
while just-so guitar lines jump in to
vie for attention.
Right at the start of the fairly per-
ambulatory verse, singer Maya von
Doll sets the tone, delivering with
a sultry drawl: "Hotter than your
average bitch, flick on, flick on my
switch".
No messing about here, what
she lacks in creative rhyming she
makes up for with brazen sexual al-
lure, playing on male fantasies of
the confident sex-kitten they
would like to meet in that
sweaty indie-disco of a
saturday night.

While the futuristic-funk of Sexy-
Back was a little too reminiscent
of Nelly Furtado's first two 2006 sin-
gles (Man-eater and Promiscuous
both also produced by Timbo), My
Love tears a page out of the book
of 2003’s mega-hit Cry Me A River.
Even the anti-JT music lovers have
to admit that when he hooked up
with Timbaland in 2003 magic was
made. The Britney-bashing Cry
Me a River helped blur the line be-
tween ballad and club record and
enabled Justin to excel on a slow
song despite his weak falsetto.
The emotion and skill which was
lacking in the vocal perform-
ance was just
poured into the
lush produc-
tion and the
international
hit was
born.

★★★★✩
The 30th October will see the re-
lease of single Janie Jones origi-
nally performed by the Clash, now
re-recorded by a number of artists
for charity. Babyshambles, Carl
Barat, The Rakes, We Are Scien-
tists and The Kooks are just a few
of the artists who appear on the sin-
gle. On the b-side is a solo version
of the track by Pete Doherty which
we happened to get hold of. Now I
personally love the Libertines, but
never really latched onto Baby-
shambles. However, given what the
guys pulling himself out of, I was
impressed. He sounds back on form
and I thoroughly enjoyed the track.
Obviously the song itself is a piece
of songwriting genius by The Clash
and only they can perform it to per-
fection, but I feel he does it justice.
All proceeds from the release will
go to Strummerville (Joe Strum-
mer’s foundation for new music)

The Good, The Bad & The Queen
Herculean
(Parlophone)
★★★★★
I have never been much of a fan of
Blur.Mostoftheirsupposedclassics
leave me rather underwhelmed, al-
though some are pleasant enough.
Gorillaz, also, do nothing for me, de-
spite my usual appreciation of Dan-
ger Mouse's work. As such, I have
never understood why so many
people consider Damon Albarn to
be some sort of musical genius,
and I certainly wasn't expecting
much from his unnamed new band.
However, on the strength of this
first single from their forthcoming
concept album about London; The
Good, The Bad & The Queen, I have
to admit to being very pleasantly
surprised.
Herculean is a whimsical, hopeful
song with an almost ethereal qual-
ity to it; there is a simple, almost
stark quality to the melody, and
the harmonies are equally under-
stated. The lyrics speak of canals,
gasworks and the welfare state and
in a few brief stanzas succeed in
evoking a strong sense of place. As
such, lyrically, it might not appeal so
strongly to those not as enamoured
of the Capital, but it is at heart an
astounding piece of music.

live review
Walter Trout and The Radicals
Mean Fiddler
To most Imperial students the
name Walter Trout probably sounds
like little more than a crap name
for a fish. However, for fans of con-
temporary blues-rock, this guy and
his band, The Radicals, are one
of the most exciting blues outfits
around, with a highly enviable live
reputation.
All of this was totally unknown
to me when a couple of weeks ago
a friend asked me if I wanted to go
and see a blues guitarist called Wal-
ter Trout. Intrigued by the name I
agreed, despite having only a pass-
ing interest in blues music, and boy
was I impressed with the result.
Put simply, the gig was awesome.
The guy clearly has a large set of
very devoted fans and the recep-
tion afforded to him before, dur-
ing and after his performance was
probably the warmest I’ve seen at
the Mean Fiddler, and not without
merit. From the first minute, the
Trout stormed through a selection
of blues and rock songs, with a hefty
dose of some very entertaining and
exciting improvisation thrown in.
A technical fault with the band’s
keyboard equipment meant the
keyboard player was redundant for
the duration of the gig, so the band
performed as a power trio, some-
thing the Trout declared he hadn’t
done since he was 18 years old, an
age which judging by his appear-
ance was probably a few decades
ago. The result of this was a gig
played louder, faster and heavier
than normal, with both audience
and band quite clearly loving it. The
set-list included some classic Trout
songs from his first albums as well
as a few from his latest album Full
Circle. Highlights included the
song Walking in the Rain, and
some blazing improvisations, with
the Trout declaring, “For 20 sec-
onds in that song I was hallucinat-
ing. I thought I was Jimmy Page”.
Indeed his guitar playing was top
class all night, and at times reach-
ing the kind of speed that no shred
guitarist would be ashamed of, but
always in his own blues-rock style.
On the down side, whilst the lack
of keyboard perhaps made for a
more ‘fun’ gig, the music did at
times seem slightly bare without
them, and it was a shame the band
weren’t able to perform as they had
planned.
Overall though it was a great gig
with a lot of memorable moments,
and which was a lot more fun than
I had expected. I would strongly
advise anyone with even a passing
interest in blues or blues-rock to go
and see Walter Trout if he comes to
London again – I know I will.

My Love
(Sony BMG)
★★★✩✩
miss it as lacking in originality.
From the manic laughter that goes
on in the background during the
chorus to the rap verse, courtesy
of the Rubberband Man himself,
T.I. all tricks available are used to
sell this song and truth be told it all
works very well. My Love is des-
tined to hang about at the top of the
charts for a while.
Fans that are able to forgive the
cheesy come-ons, see past the lit-
tle boy who cried to his mommy on
Punk'd and left Janet to take the
blame for the infamous ‘Superboob’
stunt might actually take him seri-
ously in the role of lover man. In
Justin’s best interest we’ll just pre-
tend the awful Let Me Talk To You
(Interlude) rap didn’t happen.
Jemil Salami
tinues into the chorus, as she chants
"Take me, I want a test. Take me, I'll
have no regrets" over an annoyingly
wonderful synth chord pattern. The
music is clean, sparse and Kraft-
werkian in it's clinicalness, but the
lyrics are seductive filth.
The whole thing is very self-
conciously cool and comes over a
bit gittishly trendy-scenester so I
found myself disliking the single on
principle, which is wrong because
it's really rather good. Plus they're
a bit like Goldfrapp, but sluttier
– which can only be good.
