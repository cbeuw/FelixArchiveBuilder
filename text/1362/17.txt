This Borat. He in moviefilm
Felix meets the legend and discovers if Borat is worth your hard-earned student loan
Jegsamesh, British dogs! As I ar-
rived at last Friday’s press show-
ing of Borat: Cultural Learnings
of America for Make Benefit Glo-
rious Nation of Kazakhstan, I was
greeted downstairs by the lean and
hungry looks of my journalistic col-
leagues, every one of them brim-
ming with the universal hype that
has surrounded this moviefilm.
An advertising budget of close
to £4 million and the adroit use of
Youtube.com by 20th Century Fox©
means that the publicity surround-
ing Borat is at least as widespread
as that movie with that famous
geezer and those snakes… on that
plane. With the sizzling screenplay
penned by comic genius Sacha
Baron Cohen aka Ali G (respek), we
anticipated 82 minutes of side split-
ting amusement and that, is exactly
what we got - nice!
The main premise of the movie is
that Borat Sagdiyev, an employee of
the Kazakhstan Minstry of Informa-
tion is sent by his fledgling nation to
the great country that is the ‘U, S
and A’, to learn cultural lessons that
can benefit his people at home. Af-
ter tearful goodbyes from his sister
(number four prostitute in all of Ka-
zakhstan), his strapping wife (who
kindly threatens to cut off his cock
if he is unfaithful) and of course, the
town rapist, Borat sets off with his
comrade and the film’s ‘producer’,
Azamat Bagatov.
Much hilarity ensues on their pan-
American odyssey with numerous
absolutely classic moments such as
when the pair nocturnally escape
from a guest-house run by Jews.
Borat is taught how to use a toilet
at a dinner party and later, accosts
random New-Yorkers in the street.
They are not amused.
The plot develops with hilarious
consequences with Borat bizzarely
obsessing over marrying Pamela
Anderson (even seeing that video
dissuades him only momentarily).
This results in our protagonist at-
tempting to wed the Baywatch icon
in traditional Kazakh-style when
he attends her book signing. I do
though, fully understand her re-
fusal. After all, he does try to put a
marriage sack, embroidered with
their names, over her head and
make off with the actress.
The denouement is that our two
heroes return to Kazakhstan after
learning many lessons, not least
about how uptight and socially in-
ept some Americans are (at least
in this production). Borat even pa-
rades a new spouse around the vil-
lage after his old wife not-so-sadly
passes away – high five! We all tried
to applaud at the film’s finale but
continuous laughter had sapped
our energy and we could only man-
age a breathless, “Nice!”
Although Borat is the acme of
comedy (no subtlety or pretensions
here folks), it was in fact surpassed
easily in humour by the post-show-
ing press conference, where Borat
appeared in person. After waiting
around in the resplendent Dorches-
ter Hotel, with many irate journal-
ists who hailed from all around
Europe, for what seemed like one
whole hour (reporters have no pa-
tience), the film’s star entered with
Azamat, amid much joyful cheek
kissing and hand waving.
Borat then proceeded to refer to
the dulcet-toned Charlotte Church
as a ‘Welsh prostitute’. He refused
to respond to questions from fe-
Sacha Baron Cohen starring in Borat: Cultural Learnings of America
for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan

A young white rather than a ripened red
Ridley and Russell reunited! Great!
Historical epics never were the
same after Gladiator. But what’s
this? No swords, no grandiose bat-
tles and not a Roman in sight. In-
stead we get a ‘light comedy’ that
is as great a change of direction for
both of these Hollywood A-listers
as any of us could imagine. And do
they mess it up? Of course not. But
it won’t make your top 10 either.
A Good Year isn’t a film for deliv-
ering surprises. The story focuses
on Crowe’s character, Max, a Lon-
don investment banker who inher-
its from his uncle a French chateau
and vineyard in Provence where
he used to holiday as a child. As
he tries to offload it onto the first
buyer, he reconnects with the coun-
tryside and when his professional
career back in London goes under
investigation, the fate of his inherit-
ance becomes uncertain. Chuck in
the couple of mandatory foils into
his plan to sell, namely a feisty wait-
ress, Fanny, who captures his heart
and the arrival of a girl who claims
to be the illegitimate daughter of
Max’s uncle, and the thin storyline
is in place. Twists and turns at eve-
ry corner? Not unless your sense
of foresight is seriously dented.
For fans of Russell Crowe, this
film might confuse. It doesn’t rely
on his fantastic acting ability (as did
A Beautiful Mind) or his fervent
masculinity (that which propelled
Gladiator and Cinderella Man)
and so seems more like an excuse
to hang out with old mate Ridley
again. Scott himself has also de-
parted from his usual line of work;
a strong statement considering his
diverse filmography to date. This
doesn’t have the drama of Blade
Runner, horror of Alien, grandeur
of Gladiator or hand-clasping-
desert-driving girl power of Thelma
and Louise. Despite this, both turn
in fine work with Scott presenting
Provence as paradise with some
incredible lighting and Crowe suit-
ably convincing the audience he’s
not the same man who throws
phones at hotel receptionists.
The supporting cast also shine
with Marion Cotillard as the deli-
cious French sex bomb who catch-
es Crowe’s eye and Abbie Cornish
as the alleged heir whose American
idealism provides a strong contrast
to Crowe’s cynicism. The ensem-
ble work well together, interacting
as smoothly with each other as they
do with such gorgeous scenery.
The constant references to wine
throughout bring to mind the re-
cent hit Sideways but the mediocre
story here will not garner the same
praise of that film. The comedy
is lighter, the tale forgettable and
despite the underlying message of
“life is meant to be savoured”, the
excitement of the Max’s financial
killing at the start is never matched
by the scenes in France. The idea
here was never to make an entry
into film history however. Its place
is more suited to a quiet Sunday af-
ternoon, sitting, sans hangover, in
a comfy armchair, savouring each
drop like a fine wine. This may not
gain classic status, but A Good Year
does provide a pleasant two hours.

male reporters; these had to be
relayed through a male ‘interpret-
er.’ He did address one young lady
as she arose to ask her question.
However, it was only to say, “Nice!
How much? You stay behind after!”
When quizzed by the sole (and un-
lucky) Israeli journo attendee, he
replied in terrified tones, “Keep
your claws where I can see them!”
And later, addressing the same gen-
tleman, amid our riotous guffaws,
stated, “I will crush you!” Although
the questions were thoroughly pre-
screened, they did assure raucous
humour during Borat’s speech.
I did not take up the generous of-
fer to stay with him in his Kazakh
home with free use of his sister and
much “dog-shooting.” I will, how-
ever, go to see this movie again and
again and so should you.
