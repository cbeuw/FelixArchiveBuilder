COFFEE BREAK coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Coffee Break is back with the Sarge
Reintroducing the world’s best quiz: the Felix University/College-Wide Invitational Tournament (FUCWIT)
Right, as I’m sure you’re all aware,
David Hasselhoff (otherwise known
around these parts as the Hoff) has
suddenly departed from hallowed
Imperial ground without a trace
at the end of last year, and hasn’t
returned to do his regular page in
Felix this year. Coffee Break can
exclusively reveal that he has bug-
gered off onto I’m a Celebrity, Get
Me Out of Here due to the sizeable
pay-packet he would be receiving
from it, and therefore he has left a
void in Felix that many have always
thought could not be filled (due to
the size of the Hoff’s monstrous
loins).
Luckily for all of you, however,
that’s false, as I’ve decided to hop
over from writing the common
sense column (or what the Com-
ments Editor called satire) to doing
Coffee Break. I have to say that al-
though he has left a legacy behind,
he really didn’t have much sub-
stance, and his loins weren’t as big
as mine. Think of it this way – we
voted him back for another year
with Felix (only just, fending off Op-
timus Prime) and he just buggered
off without saying goodbye. Basi-
cally, I’m far better. Hear me roar.
So stand straight when I’m talking
to you!
Anyhow, onto business, so listen
up – I was looking forward (some-
what) to returning to Imperial for
another year of soaking up knowl-
edge from friendly professors and
getting ever closer to obtaining
my degree (or not, pending alco-
hol consumption). After a long and
gruelling battle with several estate
agents, a landlord or two, and sev-
eral bed and breakfasts (don’t ask!),
I managed to get a nice little place
just a stone’s throw away from Col-
lege. I was ready to attempt to do
some sort of work – but before all
those dreams were duly shattered
as I walked onto campus, I was
blinded as I walked onto Upper
Dalby Court, where bright blues
and the new addition of greens and
pinks of the building opposite abso-
lutely wreaked havoc on my retinas.
After dropping to the ground and
quickly donning some Ray-Bans, I
decided that it was probably some-
thing to do with the BioMedical En-
gineering department’s “Restore
sight to the blind” campaign or sim-
ilar – Stevie Wonder could see those
colours, for Christ’s sake.
A little digging revealed the archi-
tect responsible for this interesting
new addition to college was a bloke
called Sheppard Robson. This is
all well and good, frankly because
when I run out of red and blue in
my colouring pencil set and want
to doodle in lectures, I would also
naturally reach for the Barbie pink
and Lime-on-acid. However, what
I can’t figure out is why somebody
has budgeted £5.7m for the project,
which was due to be finished in
April 2006, although it’s been closed
off on a few weekends and work (in-
cluding the lovely pink thing that
sits on top of the building) seems to
be ongoing periodically.
I’m not sure if this surpasses the
little civil engineering mishap of
forgetting to factor in the weight of
water in the swimming pool in the
old leisure centre (whoops), forc-
ing the pool to be built in the base-
ment instead of its original location
on the first floor, but the new one
definitely looks the part. Sitting op-
posite ‘the blue cube’, the pink and
green seems to fit in. It’s also at-
tached to the Royal School of Mines,
and I can assure everyone reading
this that the RSM had nothing to do
with what happened next door.
This naturally prompted me to
take a look around College and ex-
amine the architecture present in
a little more detail. Given what I’ve
already seen, the results weren’t
that surprising – it looks like a hun-
dred years’ worth of buildings, past
and present, were dumped on a
block behind the Science Museum
and left there as Imperial College.
In a way, I’m thankful that not eve-
rything looks the same, but at the
same time we not only possess the
cure-the-blind architecture, oh no,
we also have in our inventory a
couple of buildings – physicists look
away now – that look, from the out-
side, so dreary and uninspiring that
I could swear the architect was the
same guy who designed the office
for Dilbert, minus the cat, dog, and
the guy with his hair on fire.
This, incidently, also gave me in-
spiration for this year’s first FUC-
WIT competition. How well do you
know your way around Imperial
College and what each department
looks like? It’s time to find out this
week.
Answers:
Let’s start off easy because I don’t want any-
one to have no points after the first round.
That would just make you sad and pathetic.
Possibly the centrepiece of the Imperial
campus. Mainly there to annoy the rest of us
with constant chiming on special occasions.
Welcome to Nerd Central a.k.a Cram-City
a.k.a the answer! The stench of curry from
last year’s cram season still fills the air.
The Sarge pauses to take a look at the build-
ing that whistles on a windy day (it really
does). What’s this place called?
Plenty of Imperial students have many sto-
ries to tell about this place, but currently the
entrance is blocked off.
Sarge pauses to take a look at the home
of its slightly more drunken, lower class
citizens. He makes a hasty getaway.
Welcome to the Biomedical Engineer’s
project for restoring sight to the blind. You
can be excused for not wanting to know this.
The only place at Imperial College you’ll ever
see a naked lady. Where is the Sarge cur-
rently jerking off?
One final extra hard bonus question. What
is the name of the building, and what lies
beyond these double doors?

Welcome back to this year’s Felix
University/College-Wide Invita-
tional Tournament, or FUCWIT.
The format of this year’s compe-
tition is going to be a little spiced
up, because I know for a fact that
too many things given to you all
last year were so easily search-
able on the internet. The Hoff
got more than a little suspicious.
Anyway, here’s how it works:
You need a team name. Think
of one. Every week, make sure
you include your team name
when you email in the answers
to coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk
You get 2 marks for each ques-
tion. I’ll give one mark for what I
deem to be partially correct an-
swers, or for particularly clever
wrong answers.
This year there may be, but
not always, secret bonus marks
on one or more of the questions
based on the quality of your
answer, again to make things
interesting.
We’ll always give the maximum
number of obtainable points each
round, to keep you guessing as
to how many you can get.
This week, we’re going to give
you nine different photos of plac-
es around Imperial College. Your
job is to give us the name of the
building (i.e. not the name of the
department(s) that use it). If you
can’t find the name, you may
get one mark for other relevant
information so give it a shot. So,
how well do you know really
Imperial?
The rules of the game
