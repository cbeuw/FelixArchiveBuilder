ello once again my
fellow nocturnal be-
ings. Still no Neigh-
bours omnibus, but
the first anniver-
sary special of Deal Or No Deal
has sated my desire for trashy
television (at least I’m told that
the programme’s trashy, but Noel
Edmonds could hardly be much
more classy).
So, Halloween has come and
gone (actually, at the time of writ-
ing, it has yet to happen, so dis-
regard all of what follows) and
knees were probably up all round.
This year I didn’t buy a pump-
kin. since it’s such a colossal
waste of money and I’m no fool.
In hindsight however, I do regret
not bowing under the barrage of
spooky marketing that has beset
the nation, since a hollowed out
pumpkin would have been the
perfect housing for my poor, ne-
glected strobe light (as well as a
perfect weapon against epileptic
trick-or-treaters).
To continue on from the theme
oflastweek,briefly,Iwillwarnyou
that a few strobe lights bought off
eBay and a handful of glow-sticks
do not a perfect club-night make.
For a start, your house is prob-
ably not a club and, as such, if you
do not invite people they simply
will not come. In fact, if you do de-
cide to go down the treacherous
path into the world of home-club-
bing, without a bucketload of hal-
lucinogenic drugs you are likely
to notice that you’re actually just
a loner sat in your living room
pissing off the neighbours. Re-
ally, you’d just be better off swal-
lowing your pride and switching
Neighbours back on.
As for the page this week, you’ll
see that we have two reviews and
a teensy little preview to enter-
tain you for as long as it takes for
you to read them. Hopefully the
reviews prove to be as enlighten-
ing and fascinating to you as they
are to me.
Finally, a recommendation for
this weekend. On Sunday 5th get
your callipygian behinds over to
the union for another Alterna-
tive Music Society run Kids Will
Be Skeletons gig-night, with lots
of tasty (and French) bands em-
ploying myriad styles to tantalise
and delight your senses. I hope to
see all of you there!
Until next week, enjoy all your
nights out and maybe even send
us a review or two.
Party
time
again!

Adventures in Farringdon
Fabric’s seventh birthday celebrations fail to deliver promised root vegetables
Being the totally dedicated review-
er that I am, I decided to take this
club review from a different angle:
a sober one. Yes indeed, I did not
drink a single beverage during our
evening at Fabric, mainly for the
somewhat stupid reason that I de-
cided to drive there, although for
the sake of this review, I’ll say that
it was so I could fully appreciate the
wonder of the many acts I was plan-
ning to see, who did indeed turn out
to be quite wondrous, and perfect
for the final night of the Fabric 7th
birthday celebrations.
By the time we had worked out
how the hell to drive to Farringdon
from South Kensington, it was
about 11pm, so the place was fairly
busy when we arrived. Although not
so full as to make it uncomfortable,
the atmosphere was very friendly
and, as expected, it was not full of
obnoxiously drunk wankers (prob-
ably due to the fairly high drinks
prices) and in fact everyone was
rather smartly dressed, giving the
place a feel of what Trash might be
like if one thousand people could fit
in The End on a Monday night.
It was also somewhat refresh-
ing to go to a club with this kind
of music with mainly middle-class,
trendy clientele and not have to
queue up waiting for 15 arseholes
charging up on nose-candy to finish
with the cubicles in the toilets. Any-
way, enough with the bitching about
pointless stuff – I went here to lis-
ten to music, not to rate everyone’s
outfits and hairstyles (although I
did that too – 7/10). So, on with the
review.
Unfortunately, possibly due to the
very confusing layout of Fabric, and
me not noticing that they had set
lists up on the wall near the bar un-
til about 1am, I missed most of the
bands I wanted to see, but the first
full act I did see was the Future-
heads DJ set which consisted of a
hilariously varied selection of party
tracks, albeit with somewhat dubi-
ous mixing skills, but managing to
pretty much pack out Room 1 for
the duration of their set.
Bored with dancing to the sounds
of the 80s, we ventured over to
Room 3 to catch the middle of the
Sebastian and Kavinsky set, churn-
ing out some banging electro beats
and mixing it up to an ultra-packed
room of extremely sweaty, wide-
eyed electronic junkies. Basically,
they were pretty damn good, pos-
sibly nearly as good as their coun-
trymen, Justice (who I recently
saw DJing at Trash), perhaps be-
cause their sets sounded pretty
much identical. Who cares though?
I don’t want to hear all this new-fan-
gled rubbish, I was there to listen
to some awesome-asaurus tracks
played by a funny looking little
French dude and some other guy
I most probably would have recog-
nised as Kavinsky if I had known
what he looks like.
Room 3 was definitely the place to
be tonight if you had the energy to
Entranced by Gatecrasher
It was a good omen to the start of the
evening when I barely had to walk
to the bus stop and hop on the 360
bus straight to Elephant and Cas-
tle, home of Ministry of Sound. As
one of London’s more famous clubs,
I was looking forward to experienc-
ing it for the first time as well as
experiencing my first trance night
Gatecrasher Classics. Expecting
a large queue given its size (2000
capacity), I was surprised to find
the outside empty. I was also some-
what surprised at the unimpressive
outside, not dissimilar to airport
customs with its metal detectors.
However this is a sharp contrast to
the interior of the club. Entry was
£15 (£12 in advance), good value for
a club of M.O.S’s standard and for a
full six hours inside.
Slightly empty at 11.30pm, I felt
the night might not turn out to what
it could have been, especially as
the only clientele there were the
slightly over dressed half heartedly
‘bopping’ away to the electro/funky
house playing. Unperturbed, we
made our way to the V.I.P
. lounge
for a drink to wait for the Trance to
come on: the reason we had come.
The lounge itself is very attractive,
spacious with plenty of seating and
with a balcony overlooking the main
room, The Box (at this point still de-
serted). One slight drawback was
the price of the drinks, with our first
round alone costing well over £20! I
think it’s the only club I have been
to where the Red Bull and bottled
water are the same price. Luckily
for us, our drinks soon kicked in
along with the trance and so we
made our way over to the ever-fill-
ing dance floor.
GatecrasherClassicshadSignum,
M.I.K.E. and Rank 1 belting out the
trance classics we had all come for;
the second room, The Bar had Matt
Hardwick, Tylor Leigh and more
giving us some electro as well as
trance later on in the night. Back in
the main room Signum played the
greatly anticipated classic, What
You Got For Me, while throughout
the night the crowd were lucky
enough to have Silence-Delirium
played three times! By 1am the
dance floor was heaving but come
3am it had emptied just enough to
give us all that little bit more room
to dance in.
The clientele was pretty mixed
– ranging from regular trance fans
to those not so familiar with the
scene and from the casually attired
to those who really put a lot of effort
into their evening attire. All in all
it didn’t detract from the fact that
everyone was thoroughly enjoying
themselves and getting into the
music.
The great thing about Ministry is
for a large club one never feels like
they could get lost in yet or that it
is over run with people, yet it still
manages to pack a decent sized
crowd in.
All in all Gatecrasher Classics is
a fantastic night for those seeking
something a little different from
London’s mainstream clubs and
also for those used to music of a
harder nature. A perfect introduc-
tion to one of London’s more pleas-
ant venues.

dance, and alas, if only I had more
energy and maybe something a lit-
tle stronger than my glass of water
with extra ice to drink, I’d have
stayed here ‘til closing. However,
giving into my weak body after only
one hour of simultaneously being
compressed against 15 sweaty peo-
ple whilst trying to stay standing up
I decided to vacate Room 3 to check
out Metronomy in Room 1.
I seemed to remember Alex tell-
ing me Metronomy were maybe
quite good and possibly not horren-
dously rubbish, and indeed, he was
correct. They started off with pretty
simple guitar/synth/dance tracks
but eventually turned the room into
a gyrating mass of fans with their
new-rave, funky electro sounds.
They even had cool lights on their
T-shirts, so what more could you
want? If they didn’t please the
crowd, Filthy Dukes certainly did.
Playing a similar set to Sebastian
in the other room, but with perhaps
less of a house vibe to it, almost eve-
ryone in the club moved to Room 1
for them, and the final act Simian
Mobile Disco who ended the night
on a perfect high.
By 3am most of the people were
starting to leave and we followed
suit, happy that we’d spent a great
night out, although not relishing
the prospects of trying to drive all
the way home (and a warning – the
police hang out in unmarked cars
outside the club, pulling people
over who drive).
All in all, this place reminded me
of what Our Disco used to be like
before it vanished, and I would defi-
nitely recommend it if there is ever
a similar line-up. Speaking of Our
Disco, the line-up at Fabric on 3rd
and 4th November is mind-blow-
ingly amazing. Soulwax’s Nite Ver-
sions live, 2ManyDJs, Vitalic live,
Uffie live, Our Disco DJs, Headman
and more will invade the club for
the entire weekend. I’ll be there,
and you should be too.
