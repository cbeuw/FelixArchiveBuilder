Recently I went to see Miami Vice.
Drug smugglers in an East-Asian
country, a Chinese slut, helicop-
ters and dead bodies, more ri-
diculous acronyms than a medics
handbook and lots of pointless
sex… Wow, what can I say? I’d
seen this film a hundred times
under many different titles, but
never as badly made as this and I
haven’t even mentioned Colin Far-
rell’s over-zealous hairstylist.
I was bored stiff. To pass the time
I resorted to playing ‘Snake’ on my
phone till even that got boring and
I ended up joining the mass exo-
dus out of the cinema desperately
searching for that hour that I had
lost of my life and would never get
back.
Suddenly, it occurred to me. I
didn’t have to sit through all these
dire cinematic train wrecks. I
could make my own film. I could
show it to people. I could enter
it into the first ever IC FilmSoc
Short Film Festival taking place
on 10th December. It would be
projected onto a big screen, hun-
dreds would see it and it would
definitely be better than Michael
Mann’s pathetic excuse for a film.
All I’d have to do is grab a blank
DVD, get my camera and start
rolling.
So I ask you – fancy yourself
as the next Hitchcock or Taran-
tino? Think you could do better
than me? (Probably not but try
anyway.) FilmSoc is giving a full
month until 1st December for you
to script, direct and edit your film
into DVD format. Remember, it
has to be yours and it has to be
less than thirty minutes long.
That’s it! Whatever your stand-
Lights, camera, and action!
From the 20th to the 22nd of Octo-
ber the Imperial Windsurfing Mas-
sive spent a quite epic weekend at
the biggest windsurfing festival in
Europe. Aussie Kiss 5 in Bude was
the destination for over 600 wind-
surfing students from across the
country, including about 20 or so
excited Imperialites. On Friday af-
ternoon around 4pm the club met
around stores in double quick time
to load up the union minibus and
get going on our 6hr journey, which
was not helped by a certain Chris
M delaying our club president and
chauffeur Ben R. Arriving around
11pm and only having nicked a few
of the Ron’s cans of beer there was
a predictable rush for the bar as
600+ people indulged in the other
side of a windsurfing weekend, get-
ting tanked.
After finding one of the many car-
avans available to us at Bude Holi-
day Park and stealing a few hours
sleep, it was up for breakfast and
then pile in the minibus to Roadford
Lake for some serious windsurfing.
Force 4 winds allowed everyone to
get on the water from beginners
who had never stepped on a board
to the more advanced surfers, such
as our own Alex P
, laying down
some freestyle whilst wearing two
wetsuits.
Beginners received expert tuition
fromqualifiedcoachesincludingour
very own president Jess, all whilst
enjoying maximum time on the wa-
ter in the fantastic conditions. In-
termediate sailors were treated to
some on land tuition and guidance
from professional windsurfer Jim
Collis, helping everyone improve
their beach starts and quick tacks
(turning for the un-initiated). Ad-
vanced sailors had Jem Hall to help
them with their tricks and everyone
was able to grab some quality time
out on the water before packing up
for the day, and heading back to the
caravans to get ready for the party.
Everyone was buzzing in antici-
pation for the Caribbean themed
fancy dress party on Saturday
night, 600+ people dressed as Ras-
tafarians, Pirates, Crocodiles, hu-
man sized Malibu bottles and many,
many scantily clad windsurfers de-
scended on the bar to drink copious
amounts of rum, cider, lager and
anything they could throw down
the numerous funnels being passed
around the room.
When resident band I.D.Ology
took to the stage to lay down a blind-
ing set of covers the room exploded
into life and the new hobby of crowd
surfing took over. After many hours
of letting loose, everyone drifted off
to caravans that may or may not
have been theirs (not in the case of
Jake, returning defeated at 7am)
and grabbed a few hours before
Sunday morning arrived.
To many who don’t know, wind-
surfing is probably the greatest
hangover cure you can dream of,
and another windy day and some
shiny demo kit provided the perfect
incentive to get out of bed. After
Jem Hall and Jim Collis delivered
a fantastic self-promotional speech
on their various clinics around the

FilmSoc presents the first IC Short Film Festival: this is
your chance to get your submission viewed by the world
ard of film, give it a shot. If you’re
camera-less then STOIC will even
provide the equipment if you join
up, so there’s no excuse.
It costs just £5 to enter a film
and you gain free entry into the
festival as an esteemed film au-
teur in your own right.
I’m just sorry for you that my
film has already been made, so
mine will be the first DVD that will
be posted into the festival postbox
in the SAF, which is that large,
glass building that all the medics
eat in.
The deadline to submit your
masterpiece is 1 December, so get
busy with your Super-8 or fancy
digital cameras.
