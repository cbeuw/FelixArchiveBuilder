Greetings, crossword fans!
This week’s crossword has a
lot of Cs in it. I tried to keep them
out, but they sneaked in through
the window while I wasn’t looking.
I was also in a bit of a continen-
tal mood while writing the clues.
By this I mean, of course, that I
couldn’t think of any English words
so I used French ones instead. I
knew that AS level would come in
handy at some point.
The good news is that there
are absolutely no philosophers,
misspelled or otherwise. Poor
Friedrich.
Rawden
Yes, I mis-spelt Nietzsche. Sorry.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
A man walks into
a bar and sees two
pieces of meat nailed
to the ceiling. The
barman tells him he
can win a lot of money
if he pays a tenner and can get
them down. He responds: “Forget
it, the steaks are too high”. I think
we can all learn from this parable.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
What are you doing in
my house? Get your
feet out of my slip-
pers, prick. Is that a
pipe? You’ve got ash
all over the carpet!
Get out, I’m calling the police. GET
OUT. Now. You are about to go on
a long journey in a whole world of
hurt. In a big white ambulance.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
Everybody welcome
Chris Hemmens
to the arena! That
ker-ray-zee mofo has
contributed to Gemini
this week. An initia-
tion ceremony of child abuse and
anal beads awaits you, Chris! Now
assume the position and let the
pop-pop-popping commence!
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
If you can read this,
you’re too fucking
close. That girl there
you’ve been eyeing for
the last half hour over
your lunch doesn’t like
you. In fact, she and her friends
are discussing whether your penis
is small, or really fucking small.
You suck; your penis is tiny.
This Week’s Horoscopes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
The entire staff of
Windsor Castle will
be camping on your
doorstep tomorrow.
It became clear poor
recycling figures for
the UK was your fucking fault. You
protest their protest by burning an
urban fox you captured a week ago.
They cheer and crown you king.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
You wouldn’t believe
how hard it is (for me
the intruder) to come
up with twelve funny
things to say. I haven’t
even managed one,
and I’m over halfway down the
page already. Having said that, it’s
still funnier than the Felix comics.
But then, so is amoebic dysentery.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
You’re offended by
the horoscopes, and
believe that flam-
ing, fusing balls of
hydrogen thousands
of millions of miles
away can influence your day to day
life. Congratulations! You have the
intellectual capacity of a gnat, and
the good looks of rabid goat.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
Aliens invade today,
and force the most
intelligent to pair off
and mate non-stop.
Unfortunately, it
appears that physi-
cal beauty and intelligence are
inversely proportional to one an-
other, and you end up getting knob
chafe off a minger. Hahahaha.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
The masked psycho-
path aims his assault
rifle at your head. To
kick his legs out from
beneath him, turn to
page 18. To break his
face, turn to page 71. To run like a
pathetic coward, turn to drugs in
an attempt to assuage the guilt of
leaving everyone to die.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
Horoscope brethren:
apologies. A bearded
intruder has abused
our hallowed page.
Damage limita-
tion methods were
employed, but not entirely success-
fully. If you see a hairy man: kill
him. Leave no trace. Shadow hide
you. Fear nothing.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Critics describe your
next week as ‘stun-
ning’, ‘a breathtaking
tour de force’ and ‘the
best thriller since
The Ipcress File’.
You receive three academy award
nominations, while your stuntman
receives two. In the end, you both
only win one. You are both pleased.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
You’re really irritat-
ing. In fact, your mere
presence makes me
want to barf up my
large intestine. You
have the fetid body
odour of a whale carcass, and your
small-minded, viciously racist
political ideals make nuns cry. In
short, I hate you.
