the name I agreed, despite having
only a passing interest in blues
music, and boy was I impressed

Turnstiles to come?
College has unveiled plans to
change the access to the campus,
with reception desks within build-
ings being phased out in favour of
swipe card turnstiles.
Through the summer, the Col-
lege has been consulting with
staff around the campus in order
to decide how best to “restructure
reception services”. The initial
plans, which were the subject of
discussion amongst College Secu-
rity and receptionists, involved the
closure of twelve out of the fifteen
reception desks around campus,
with two more being converted into
‘concierge positions’. In the build-
ings where reception desks were
to be removed, turnstiles activated
by swipe cards were to be installed,
similar to the ones in the newly
completed Chemistry entrance.
This meant that visitors to one of
the buildings with turnstiles would
be directed to a central desk in the
Sherfield Building where a member
of staff from the desk or the desti-
nation department would take the
visitor to the correct building and
give them access.
The revised plans are somewhat
similar, with seven desks remain-
ing: the College Main Entrance,
the Chemistry & Biochemistry
building, the Blackett Lab (Phys-
ics entrance), the Faculty Building,
the Huxley Building, the Skemp-
ton Building and the Sir Alexander
Fleming Building. The external
facing entrances will be swipe card
access only; these are the Royal
School of Mines entrance, the Hux-
ley entrance at 180 Queens Gate,
and the Aeronautical Engineering
entrance. These entrances will only
be accessible to students who study
in these departments, apart from
the Aero entrance, which will per-
mit any student with a swipe card.
The loss of reception desks means
that extra staff are likely to be tak-
en on to deal with the extra mail.
Whereas post was previously left in
the reception areas of buildings by
postal staff, it will now be delivered
directly to the department itself, re-
sulting in “an improved postal serv-
ice”. Couriers will also be directed
to new drop-off points, varying with
department.
Felix has learned that plans to in-
stall more of the swipe card access
turnstiles in buildings are under
consideration. The turnstiles are
monitored with CCTV, and only al-
low access to students and staff
who work inside that particular
building. Jumping the gates should
trigger alarms, and Security can
locate the jumper by viewing the
CCTV footage. Turnstiles are likely
to be added to the Queen’s Gate and
Prince Consort Road entrances by
January.
When the plans were proposed
during the summer, they were met
with criticism from some inhabit-
ants of the campus. Some suggest-
ed that they would make collabora-
tion across departments difficult, as
freedom of movement from building
to building would be restricted. Ceri
Davis, Head of Security, has said
that the final decision on who would
be allowed access to the building
College closes reception desks around South Kensington campus
would depend on what the man-
agers of the building wanted, and
that despite the buildings being on
swipe-controlled access 24 hours a
day, College Security has no prob-
lem allowing all students and staff
access to all the buildings.
Though Mr Davis has promised
proximity readers for turnstiles,
the ones in the Chemistry Entrance
are magnetic strip only, and have
proved somewhat problematic,
being slow to reset on occassion.
However, the concierge position al-
lows congestion to be bypassed by
opening the glass gates.
The overall aim of the plans is to
improve the security of South Ken-
sington campus, and to centralise
visitor access. However, the prom-
ised closure of Imperial College
Road, and turnstile placement at all
entrances of the campus are prob-
ably a fair way off since both West-
minster and the Royal Borough
Councils must agree, and may also
depend on the long-term plan of pe-
destrainising Exhibition Road.
Elections complete
This year’s Council elections are
complete, with results being an-
nounced at Thursday lunchtime,
but not without the usual share of
silliness, farce, and mistakes.
Despite being announced as “the
most successful Council Elections
turn-out ever”, the average turn-
out was only 7.2%. This is likely at-
tributable to the lack of campaign-
ing of most candidates, as most of
them were standing unopposed by
anyone but Re-Open Nominations
(RON). The highest turn-out was in
the Faculty of Medicine, with 12.3%
of undergraduates coming out to
vote for their counsellors.
Notable victors from the elections
were: Ashley Brown, the editor of
Live! (CGCU online newspaper,
live.cgcu.net), who was elected as
Postgraduate Engineering Coun-
sellor; Alex Guite, the leader of the
NUS Yes campaign, who was elect-
ed as Postgraduate Natural Science
counsellor; and Andy Sykes, the Fe-
lix editor, who was elected as Non-
Faculty Counsellor, a rather odd
position that represents less than
100 students in the College, includ-
ing those in the Tanaka Business
School and the sabbs themselves.
Despite heavy email campaign-
ing by John Collins, the Union
President, some positions remain
unfilled, and will have to be elected
at the next Council meeting. An ‘ad-
ministrative error’ lead to the Wel-
fare Campaigns Officer not being
included on the website form for
voting or standing, leaving prospec-
tive officers confused. This position
will also by elected at Council.
As reported two weeks ago, hus-
tings in the JCR proved as farci-
cal as usual, with most students
only paying attention when RON
(Stephen Brown) took to the stage.
Nonetheless, any increase in vot-
er turn-out for what is often seen
as the “hacks’ elections” is to be
commended.

Student’s death in Beit Hall
An undergraduate maths student
was found dead in his room in Beit
Hall on Tuesday.
The alarm was raised by the stu-
dent’s mother, who had not been
able to contact her son. The war-
dening staff acted immediately and
gained access to his room, then
called paramedics and the police.
The cause of death is being inves-
tigated by the police. The student
had previously suffered from epi-
lepsy however.
The student’s parents have been
informed of the tragedy, and a Col-
lege tutor is currently supporting
them, along with the Warden of Beit
Quad. Ben Harris, Deputy Presi-
dent (Education & Welfare), said:
“At this sad time the thoughts of all
those involved in the Union are with
the student’s friends and family.”
