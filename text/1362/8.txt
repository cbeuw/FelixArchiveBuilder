A waste of time, effort, and money
I
thoroughly believe that Im-
perial should vote in the up-
coming referendum to stay
out of the NUS. Why? I write
as someone who has experi-
ence of NUS from being President
of Durham Students’ Union (DSU).
I have only just started at Imperial,
but I can speak as someone who
was very heavily involved in DSU
and had precious few good experi-
ences with the National Union.
There are three core problems
with the NUS. It doesn’t know what
it’s for, it has no forum to decide
what it should do, and it is incapable
of acting when it makes policy deci-
sions. Beyond this, there is a fourth
issue that is not so much about the
theoretical institution, but the peo-
ple who are involved: it is highly
self-serving, and frequently more
concerned with its own internal
politics than issues facing students
across the UK.
I went to three NUS National
conferences – 2003, 2004, and 2005
– such are the pleasures of stu-
dent union presidency. There will
be those who will say that Imperial
needs a national voice and NUS is
where it can achieve it. One visit to
NUS National Conference (NC) il-
lustrates how false this is.
My first visit to NUS NC was com-
paratively better than everyone had
told me it would be – sure you had
rigged elections, voting cards that
you could buy from political factions
Their ideals may seem attractive on the surface, but if you have ever been unfortunate enough to be closely
involved with the NUS you will know the reality is a whole world away from what they lead us to believe
in return for your support, people
on the balcony instructing their fac-
tion how to vote, stage occupations,
endless procedural motions, votes
taking longer than an hour, dismal
attendance by the NEC (National
Executive Committee – NUS’s top
officers), but in comparison to what
I was promised this seemed like
above par for the course.
Go three times and you realise
how entrenched these failings are.
Political factions dominate NUS.
People grouping together because
of a shared goal of opinions is no
bad thing, but at NC all that mat-
ters to swathes of the delegates is
which faction wins each issue, not
the issue/election itself.
Because of the power of the fac-
tions, and the amount of noise a
small group of students can make,
NUS is impotent to represent the
“average” (I don’t use this term
pejoratively) student. Near riots,
screams of “Intimidation!”, and
farcical votes of no confidence will
be brought up at the first mention
of the Israel/Palestine occupation,
but barely anyone will listen during
a student housing debate, and the
resolution eventually passed will
be so very mundane and anodyne
you’ll wonder why you even both-
ered to vote.
This polarisation extends to the
NUS’s campaigns. The only higher-
education funding line the NUS will
even listen to is the total abolition
E
very warden at Imperial
has an added remit re-
lated to the role of liaison.
For example, one warden
is the liaison for issues
regarding the Health Centre, an-
other with Registry for discipli-
nary hearings etc.
I am the Neighbours liaison. I’m
not entirely sure how this was ac-
tually assigned. It could be because
I am ‘battle-hardened’ – having
dealt diplomatically with a hurl of
abuse from one particular neigh-
bour on more than one occasion
before such roles were officially
assigned.
Or, hailing from Australia, some-
one thought it amusing to assign
me the role of liaison with the
namesake of that atrocious Aussie
soap opera!
Being in my penultimate year as
warden of Fisher Hall in Evelyn
Gardens (appointments are made
for a fixed period) I have amassed
a comprehensive list of all the cre-
ative ways in which students man-
age to get themselves into trouble.
For the most part, getting up to
some mischief is all good fun but
the funny side is not always ap-
preciated by private residents
who live in the neighbourhood or
indeed by the wardening team
who often have to deal with the
consequences.
And a particular neighbourhood
it is indeed, where the cost of an
average two-bedroom flat is com-
parable to the GDP of a small
country and the standard vehicle
of choice is either a Porsche, Ma-
serati, or a Chelsea tractor.
A few years ago I had to disci-
pline one of my student residents
to make him understand that it
was not acceptable behaviour to
urinate on one of these posses-
sions, parked outside Fisher, while
his mate took photos.
Neither was it acceptable for one
student to be lowered, on a rope,
by a friend, from a 3rd-storey win-
dow to a 2nd-storey one, to be let
back into his room.
Noise is a particular problem.
It only takes a few individuals in
a high density accommodation
environment to generate a level
of noise which can quickly annoy
neighbours.
Noise curfews are in place at all
halls of residents at Evelyn Gar-
dens but these rules are, regret-
tably, sometimes flouted. So, on a
number of occasions my warden-
ing team has had to diplomatically
handle calls from very irate neigh-
bours: “… yes sir … of course sir
... we will look into it straight away
… yes … no sir, they’re not all ani-
Everybody needs a good neighbours’ liaison officer
of fees. This is an attractive argu-
ment, but go and speak to MPs and
it ruins any chance of a debate – it
made discussion almost impossi-
ble when at the Higher Education
Act 2004 votes Durham was trying
to argue that top-up fees weren’t
the way to fund education and we
should look at other options, but all
the NUS hacks could argue was the
same inflexible line – it must be to-
tally free with no payment.
In the three years I was involved
the NEC were a supercilious, self-
interested group. They would turn
up at Durham once in a blue moon,
although you will no doubt get the
chance to meet many of them in
the next few weeks – if there’s one
thing you can be sure they’ll turn
up for it’s a disaffiliation/affiliation
referendum. After this initial flurry,
Imperial would see very little input
from the NEC, yet we’d be paying
them tens of thousands of pounds
a year.
In fact finances have been a major
problem in NUS with many (most?)
affiliated institutions underpaying,
leaving NUS with a massive deficit
(the truly incompetent spending of
money by the NEC also does little
to ameliorate this issue). Even the
NUS Treasurer 2004/05 (Martin
Ings, an uncharacteristically hon-
est and hard working NEC mem-
ber) would often look despairing as
he read out the latest batch of NUS
expenditure.

Surely, though, as I’m sure the
pro-NUS camp will rightly say, Im-
perial needs national representa-
tion: as the relationship with the
University of London draws to a
close, it’s vital that we can speak up
and be counted.
I couldn’t agree more, but NUS
isn’t capable of being that forum.
We should look at working with
comparable institutions – strong in-
dependent unions working togeth-
er, co-ordinating campaigns and
lobbying. We’re ideally situated to
meet regularly with relevant MPs
– at the mass lobbies of Parliament
that NUS organises the turnout
is often embarrassing. We will be
more effective acting without the
cumbersome monolith.
The pro-NUS camp will idealisti-
cally talk about the voice NUS will
offer us, the solidarity we’ll develop,
the resources for union officers and
the benefits for every student. We
are only able, however, to join one
version of NUS – the real-world
version, and that couldn’t be fur-
ther from the ideals that it should
espouse.
NUS has much to gain from Im-
perial joining, yet we have little to
tempt us bar the chance of 10% off
at Topshop.
Let’s save our cash, our time, and
the trips to Blackpool, and instead
plough that resource into working
actively with other unions and im-
proving services right here.

Over the years I have attended
Kensington and Chelsea Police
Community Panel and Neighbour-
hood Watch meetings where I
was able to meet neighbours and
police officers and discuss issues
which were of relevance to halls of
residence.
Most neighbours are quite happy
to have students around them but
it is the intolerant few which we, as
the wardening team, need to pla-
cate. This task is made easier when
students respect the fact that liv-
ing in an area which was recently
referred to as the most expensive
real estate in the world brings with
it certain added responsibilities.
Considering the concentration
of students that we have at Evelyn
Gardens, the number of incidents
are comparatively low.
There are also certain advantag-
es: local businesses love the extra
commerce that the students bring
and some offer substantial dis-
counts. The restaurant Tampopo,
for example, gives a 20% discount
with a student card. A number of
other outlets regularly give us free
items to use as raffle prizes.
The fact that students don’t bring
cars down to London also means
that parking congestion is less
than it would be if Evelyn Gardens
was all residents.
And I wonder how many burglars
have been scared off by the noctur-
nal habits of some of our students.
