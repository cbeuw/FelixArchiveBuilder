Pop Magazine
Sure the first 20 pages
are adverts, but at least
the adverts are pretty. A
younger more fashion
focused version of i-D.
Marie Antoinette
Sure it doesn't have much
of a plot, and has Kirsten
Dunst's annoying face in
it. But the costumes are
beautiful.
Holy Moly
Popbitch's more accurate
cousin. To be fair, I don't
really care if the shock-
ing celebrity exploits
are made up, as long as
they're entertaining.

Save the world with ram-
pant consumerism. Using
a <Red> credit card
doesn't really cut down
to the real issues caus-
ing poverty. What it does
do is make Bono look
unbearably smug.
Peaches Geldof
Has yet to come to the
crushing realisation that
she an invisible speck in
the universe and no-one
cares that she DJs. Any-
one who has ears can DJ.
Surely she's overdue for a
visit to the Priory.
Madonna
Went on various talk
shows to counter media
accusations and pro-
moted her new book, and
also left the baby with a
nanny the first night back
in England. This makes it
seem less like she wants
to publicise Malawi's
difficulties, and more like
she's an attention-seeking
media-whore.

Chanel wasn't just a fashion de-
signer; she was a style revolution-
ary of her time. Chanel challenged
the traditional fashions of the day,
rejecting the restrictive impractical
stylesforpracticalbutelegantcloth-
ing. Her innovations became basics
in the wardrobes of generations of
women: jersey suits and dresses,
the chemise, pleated skirts, the
cardigan suit, the blazer, the little
black dress, the sling pump, strap-
less dresses, the trench coat. Much
like Comme De Garcons is to Rei
Kawakubo, Chanel was an expres-
sion of Coco’s personal style; a mix
of the vocabulary of both male and
female clothes.
Coco was associated with the
most creative artists of the day:
Diaghilev, Picasso, Stravinsky and
Cocteau. She liked to express her-
self through the fashion she created
and once said, “Fashion is not some-
thing that exists in dresses only.
Fashion is in the sky, in the street,
fashion has to do with ideas, the
way we live, what is happening.”
Of other designers, Chanel said,
“Fashion has become a joke. The
designers have forgotten that there
are women inside the dresses.”
Chanel believed that women should
dress simply and comfortable, she
made only clothes that she herself
would wear. In a way Chanel was
a feminist in the clothes she de-
signed, built to work with women
rather than restrict them.
The name Coco was adopted by
Chanel when, after a brief stint as
a seamstress, she started working
as a cabaret singer at La Rotonde.
At the Café La Rotonde she met
Etienne Balsan, a millionaire cav-
alry officer and textile heir, who fi-
nanced her move to Paris. Through
Balsan, Coco was introduced to
high society where she acquired
the habits and tastes of the wealthy.
She became a hat designer in 1908,
providing an alternative to the os-
trich boa hats women in high soci-
ety wore, which she herself found
distasteful. Using the resources
of Balsan and another patron, she
opened her first millinery shop in
Deuville 1912. Through her con-
tacts with high society, her shop
soon became a success.
From hats, Chanel added clothes
to the collection, with her romantic
affairs with the artist Paul Iribe,
the Duke of Westminster, Grand
Duke Dmitri of Russia, and British
sportsman Arthur Capel having a
considerable influence on her often
male-inspired fashions. Capel’s lav-
ish gifts of jewels served as the key-
stones of Coco's astonishing collec-
tion of costume jewellery. Costume
jewellery had previously been un-
fashionable, but Coco popularised
it, using fake jewels in lavish ropes
of imitation pearls to enhance her
simple understated clothes. It was
also Capel’s blazer, lent to Coco on
a chilly day at the polo grounds, that
inspired her famous box jacket.
Chanel was arguably the most
innovative designer of her time.
She was first designer to use wool
jersey in women’s wear, using it to
make soft clingy dresses. Wool jer-
sey had previously been used solely
for men’s underwear. Her original
use of jersey fabric attracted the at-
tention of influential wealthy wom-
en, because it freed them from the
prevalent corseted style of dresses.
Her nonconformist designs revo-
lutionized the textile industry. Her
designs were also credited with the
development of American mass
production. Her designs were sim-
ple and used standard fabrics, mak-
ing them easy to copy. Thousands
of knock-offs of her designs were
made, sometimes costing more
than an original Chanel.
In contrast with most designers
Chanel was not perturbed by this,
saying, “I want my dresses to go
out on the street.” Coco, controver-
sially, popularised women's trou-
sers with her design of bell-bottom
trousers, which she had designed to
enable her to climb more easily in
and out of gondolas in Venice. She
also, if accidentally, kicked off the
feminist trend of bobbed hair when
after singeing her hair she decided
to cut it all off. Tanning was another
accidental trend started by Chanel,
after she accidentally became sun-
burned during a cruise to Cannes.
Chanel loved to quote the poet
Paul Valery, saying, “a badly per-
fumed woman has no future.” In
1922 Chanel introduced the fra-
grance that insured her fame,
Chanel No. 5, named after Coco’s
lucky number. The first to be sold
worldwide, it stood out with its Art
Deco bottle and minimalist pack-
aging. It contrasted with the other
flamboyant perfume bottles of the
time, in the same way that her re-
laxed fashions were in sharp con-
trast to the corset fashions popular
in the previous decades. Chanel
No. 5 remains an indelible symbol
of Chanel and is still popular today.
As Chanel's Senior VP of Marketing
and Sales Jean Zimmerman says,
“The success of No5 is due to the
fragrance itself and the very crea-
tive advertising behind it."
In 1923 Chanel launched the sig-
nature Chanel suit; a knee-length
skirt and trim, boxy jacket, tradi-
tionally made of woven wool with
black trim and gold buttons and
worn with large costume-pearl
necklaces. Chanel retired in 1938
but returned in 1954 to introduce a
new suit design; a collarless, braid-
trimmed cardigan jacket with a
graceful skirt. At first this was not
very popular with Europeans, espe-
cially the press, perhaps as a result
of the tarnishing of her reputation
during the war. During her retire-
ment she had an affair with a Nazi
officer, diminishing her popularity.
She moved to Switzerland, return-
ing to reopen her Paris shop only to
boost lagging perfume sales. How-
ever unpopular at first in Europe,
her new suit was a massive success
in America, and worn by the likes of
Jackie Kennedy. By the 1960s much
of what Coco was doing was refining
the classic Chanel look. However,
despite now being part of the fash-
ion establishment she once hated,
she still liked to rebel against estab-
lished trends, creating boyish flap-
per creations to contrast with the
Belle Époque millinery fashionable
at that time. She also worked for
various Hollywood studios, dress-
ing the likes of Audrey Hepburn,
Liz Taylor and Anne Baxter.
By the time of Chanel’s death, her
fashion empire made over $160m a
year and counted among its clients
Princess Grace, Queen Fabiola,
Marlene Dietrich and Ingrid Berg-
man. As a Time article published
on January 25th, 1972, a week after
her death said: "Just her name was
enough to define a pair of shoes, a
hat, a pocketbook, a suit, perfume,
jewellery—an entire look. It con-
veyed prestige, quality, impecca-
ble taste and unmistakable style.
By her death last week at 87, the
French couturière had long since
established herself as the 20th cen-
tury's single most important arbiter
of fashion."
"Fashion has
become a joke.
The designers
have forgotten
that there are
women inside
the dresses."
