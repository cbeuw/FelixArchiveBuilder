Ex-president
disregarded
constitution
Robert Winston:
Playing God?
The previous President of the Un-
ion, Sameena Misbahuddin, may
have “flagrantly disregarded” the
Union’s constitution, claimed Jon
Matthews (Deputy President, Fi-
nance & Services) at a meeting
of the Executive Committee on
Tuesday.
Mr Matthews’ comments were
made while introducing a pa-
per submitted to the Committee,
which accuses Miss Misbahuddin
of breaching the consitution dur-
ing her handling of the sabbatical
elections last year. The allegations
centre around the post of Deputy
President (Graduate Students), a
post currently occupied by Shama
Rahman. Ms Rahman apparently
put forwards a proposal to the Ex-
ecutive Committee, via Miss Misba-
huddin, that suggested she take up
her position in September, rather
than in July with the other sabbs.
This was to allow Miss Rahman to
work on completing her MSc during
July and August; refusal of the pro-
posal may have meant Miss Rah-
man would have to step down.
Miss Rahman claims to have spo-
ken to Miss Misbahuddin about the
proposal while she was deliberat-
ing over whether to stand for the
position. However, the first paper
put before Exec by Miss Misbahud-
din was only a day before the final
candidates’ meeting that would
allow the votes to be counted. As
such, only 24 hours were allowed
for discussion of the paper, which
was done by “electronic meeting”,
something that is neither allowed
nor forbidden by the Union’s consti-
tution. The proposal was rejected by
6 votes to 5, and shortly afterwards
another proposal was circulated
after the final candidates’ meeting
with a very short deadline. Again,
the paper was discussed electroni-
cally, with most of the votes arriv-
ing after the deadline. The proposal
was passed 6 to 5, but some Exec
members were unhappy with the
short deadlines, lack of discussion
and apparently forcefulness of Miss
Misbahuddin and leaked the closed
session emails.
On learning of the leak, Miss Mis-
bahuddin told Exec that she “no
longer trusted them” with closed
session business, and that she
would decide on such business by
herself, without consulting the com-
mittee, which is unconstitutional.
The two proposals led to confusion
as the new sabbs arrived this year,
with the team being presented with
the first, rejected proposal rather
than the second, accepted propos-
al. The former said that the DPGS
would be absent for the whole of
August, when in fact she would be
absent for the last three weeks of
August, and work two days a week
during July and the first week of
August.
This reporter was unable to con-
tact Miss Misbahuddin, but spoke
to the previous incumbent of the
post of Deputy President (Clubs
& Societies), Simon Matthews. Mr
Matthews said that he only knew
about Miss Rahman’s proposal 24
hours before the candidates’ meet-
ing, when it was brought to Exec,
and added that he felt “it [the deci-
sion] was definitely rushed”. Com-
menting on the threat to conduct
closed session Exec business with-
out consulting the committee, Mr
Matthews said: “I’m not 100% sure
that anything was decided outside
of Exec that should have been dis-
cussed.” He also hinted that he
was being kept in the dark about
Miss Misbahuddin’s decisions: “I’m
aware of a few things (I’m not going
to be specific) that I wasn’t told at
the time but would have expected
to have been.” However, he said
that he felt the threat of unilateral
action was more of a “threat/loss of
temper” than a serious move.
He was supportive of Miss Mis-
bahuddin’s attempts to get the
proposal approved, calling it “well-
intentioned”. However, he was criti-
cal of the handling of the second
proposal: “Exec certainly had no
time to consider it properly, and
there was a significant amount of
pressure brought to bear to accept
it. With hindsight... they should have
stuck to their original decision.”
The reasons for the current sabb
team bringing up this matter have
been questioned by a number of
hacks. Ostensibly, the paper was
brought to try to amend the consti-
tution to clarify the situation with
electronic meetings, and to recon-
sider the role of the DPGS. The
paper included several options for
a future Graduate Students rep-
resentative, such as changing the
start date, making it part-time sab-
batical position akin to a Faculty
Union President, and renaming
the position to GSA Chair. These
considerations will be investigated
over the next few weeks by the sabb
team.

Lord Robert Winston, took part in a special lecture entitled
‘Playing God?’ on Tuesday evening inside the Great Hall. The IC
Professor of Fertility Studies spoke to a packed house about the
connections between faith, religion and science. There was one
especially amusing anecdote about the scientist who discovered
sperm cells, only to be afraid of his own small wriggling gametes,
thinking he had some strange disease.
