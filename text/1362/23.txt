Lithuania, at 11pm, during a hefty
storm you don’t entirely expect the
booking you had so carefully made
on Lastminute.com (confirmed of
course, with an ‘enjoy your trip’ and
everything) to have the status of a
mythical creature.
‘Minute Las-
tas?’ shrugs the
blonde hotel sec-
retary. ‘No, sorry.
I no know dis.’
And with that
she shrugs with
all the equanim-
ity of someone in
Londonwhocan’t
tell you how to change from the Pic-
cadilly line to the Bakerloo line; not
someone about to chuck you out
on your arse in deepest Lithuania,
bait for Russian gangsters or circus
troops looking for replacements for
theirnowoutlaweddancingbears.It
is besides the point that after three
days of threats it was resolved and
we were upgraded to a new hotel
(three stars: get in!). In those three
days we were told that our only
option was to sleep on the floor of
some cupboard in the corner of the
hotel with no locks and only a rap-
ist named Vlad for company. I spent
hours on the phone to some bored
idiot in Slough who was desperate
for a cigarette break and didn’t care
in the least if I ended up strung up
with no pants on. Lastminute.com
have made my list and will remain
there until the next time I can’t be
bothered looking anywhere else
and, victim of advertising that I am,
book with them yet again.
Vilnius has been annexed a great
deal. Every time some superpower
found themselves with little to do,
they annexed Vilnius for a Sunday
lark. As a result, it is a truly Euro-
pean cultural blend, and all the bet-
ter for it. The Old Town is one of the
biggest in Europe and exists as one
of the finest examples of Baroque
architecture one can see. It was
however, built over a few centuries
so amongst the Baroque rests the
austere splendour of the Renais-
sance and the intricate madness
that those crazed Gothic architects
dreamt up. In the 3.6 square kilome-
tresoftheOldTown,46Churcheslit-
ter the skyline: there are the gaudy
crowns atop Orthodox Churches,
the great white domes of Catholic
Churches and the more subtle yet
on inspection, equally magnificent
synagogues, all resting in what
now appears as harmony, but one
imagines the friction of old, elec-
trifying the city to its core. For the
discerning Reli-
gious viewer the
two most neces-
sary attractions
are St. Anne’s
Church – with a
façade of such
Gothic pomp
that a sprightly
Napoleon, on his
way to freeze in Russia, wished to
carry it to Paris ‘in the palm of his
hand.’ Then there is the Church of
Saint’s Peter and Paul: a Baroque
interior which took decades to carve
out of pure white stone, so intricate
and delicate, taking the breath from
your lungs on entry, it exists as a
kind of architectural extreme sport,
vacating your lungs of air on entry,
not giving it back until you wander
back into the sunlight outside. Ba-
roque parachuting, perhaps.
But the greatness of Vilnius is not
its landmarks; the castles, the Ca-
thedral all have something to offer,
but the lustre of the place is gained
from a holistic view. Just wan-
der. Curved streets with coloured,
detailed facades litter the place.
Courtyards in
unexpected
places; climbing
ivy and grand
trees framing
crumbling stone
buildings, his-
tory emanat-
ing from every
fissure. Stroll
across a bridge with hundreds of
padlocks left by newly married
couples covering the railings; en-
ter the esoteric world of the Uzupis
district, whose people (artists obvi-
ously) decided to declare independ-
ence from the rest of Vilnius. Read
their constitution, engraved in
metal, hung on the wall of an insig-
nificant alley: ‘A cat has the right to
be a cat,’ and other quaint inanities.
The atmosphere of the place, un-
like any other I have experienced,
is to be imbibed everywhere you go,
around every corner, at the foot of
every holy structure and in front of
every crazed market seller.
Do, however, avoid the boiled
pig’s ear. Vilnius has managed to
cultivate a drinking culture that
is beyond the grasp of dear old
Blighty. The idea of spending time
in a pub, drinking slowly whilst
eating an (often) excellent meal is
a welcome change from the unex-
plainable compulsion London cre-
ates of inhaling 8 pints in 2 hours,
inhaling 2 kebabs in 8 minutes and
stomping off to find a corner to fulfil
the duel purpose of vomit recepta-
cle and bed for the night. The pubs
in Vilnius are a glory indeed. Vast
caves, dark halls, wooden and at-
mospheric, trees growing up from
the basement are all far superior to
a Wetherspoons, whose main ascet-
ic feature is the crumpled hooker in
the corner. Food is served by Bal-
tic beauties and is everything you
could want to accompany a 2-litre
jug of beer: Zeppelins are a deep-
fried potato oval, filled with cream,
meat, cheese and bacon, topped
with cream, meat cheese and bacon.
Fried bread sticks with a creamy,
cheese concoction make beer taste
like Athena’s breast milk (possibly)
and meat comes bloody and softer
than the clouds above. But there
are pitfalls: platters of ear, fried or
boiled, stumps which were once the
foot of a pink porker, sheep’s stom-
achs – which,
when bitten into,
occasionally
crack, reveal-
ing putrid green
juices and black
stones of undi-
gested food. One
must learn to
take the rough
with the smooth when eating in
Vilnius.
Vilnius is, apparently, the new
Prague, along with about 5 other
capitals in Eastern Europe. Largely
because of its size, Vilnius probably
does have the potential to become
a seething mass of tourism though,
so go now before the stampede of
shaven-headed English men ar-
rive, holding aloft the stag, ‘la la
la-ing’ into the night and perpetu-
ating the stereotype in yet another
innocent nation. In one pub, I saw
the first wave, standing in a circle,
pints clasped close to their Burber-
ry shirts, looking around, tongues
out, searching for birds and fights.
The English thug is an unfortunate
creature. They should be cleansed,
by nail-gun if necessary. I’ll do it,
vigilante style, if legislation does not
arrive soon to rid us of this plague.
So, what of The Gorgon and Jim
Morrison? Well, Jim had somehow
managed to get to San Francisco
for a month and had come back
firmly believing he was in fact, The
Lizard King. Either nobody had
the heart to tell him he was not a
look-a-like, or they just blindly ac-
cepted him as a grim product of
Westernisation. The Gorgon was
in fact called Gorga (as if it makes
a difference) and was the most en-
tertaining encounter of my young
life so far. A mass of uncontrollable
nonsense, he prowled the bar, swig-
ging people’s drinks, caterwauling
all the while, and then returning to
explain the subtleties of Lithuanian
culture to me (in bellowed Lithua-
nian, of course), before going to
sleep on the floor. The point is that
in this haven of beauty and history,
there was a kind of hospitality like
no other, a welcoming, inclusive
atmosphere that begs to be experi-
enced. Go there, and if you find your
own Gorgon, or maybe even the leg-
end himself, embrace him, for you
will miss him when he’s gone.
