CLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk
IC Radio bring us the noise
ICRadio discos can answer so
many of your problems. Perhaps
your club or society is organising
a disco? Perhaps you want to host
the party to end all parties? Do you
need a sound system so magnifi-
cent that the bass blows everyone
in attendance away? Perhaps you
need to hire a DJ? Are you a DJ
who wants to play at a disco? Well
then IC Radio is the club for you.
We have a dedicated disco team
that hire out our impressive sound
system to clubs and societies for
their parties, socials and other
non-descript gatherings of booze-
hounds. For those of you who are
technical-minded, it includes two
Technics 1210 turntables, a Be-
hringer 2500 Amp, some impres-
sively large speakers, a Denon dual
CD mixer and a four channel De-
non mixer. We’ve also got monitor
speakers, microphones and other
essential equipment. All of which
adds up to tremendous aural pleas-
ure for all of those in attendance.
In essence, ICRadio can provide
your club, society or just your group
of friends with all the equipment
you will need and a DJ who cuts all
the mustard in sight. All of which
comes at a very reasonable price.
We’ve already helped organise
four discos this term, like the Civ- Lisa and Seb DJing at one of many wild CivSoc boat parties
Soc Christmas Party and the Eras-
mus party, and have more lined up.
One happy customer said, “A live
DJ really improved the atmosphere
and provided a focus for the party”,
and “the sound system and mu-
sic were excellent.” Another said,
“That was the best disco I went to
that night!”
Perhaps you are an experienced
DJ, or want to become an experi-
enced DJ, who plays at all the top-
notch events that ICRadio enter-
tain? Whether you’re a professional
or just another amateur who’s nev-
er played before you could be DJing
at one of these discos.
ICRadio is often called up by soci-
eties looking for DJs to play at their
events. DJing for ICRadio is not
only great fun, but for one night’s
work you can earn yourself enough
cash to pay for your next night out
with your friends (as long as you go
to Cheapskates).
Most of our work is cheesy old-
school hits, modern pop and hip-
hop, but we do get the occasional
call up for alternative or house mu-
sic. The more people we have for
each genre the more often we get
invited to perform at events.
If your society needs a sound
system, or if you’re up for some
DJing, send an email to sebas-
tian.kaminski@ic.ac.uk.
Moon Unit: IC’s favourite rock show
Under the guise of our superhero
alter egos, SuperDan and Essex
Boi, we aim to bring you the great-
est in guitar sounds. Well, sort of.
The music on Moon Unit is nothing
other than our taste, much like most
shows on ICRadio. It is an amalga-
mation of the majority of what the
media calls ‘alternative’. We call it
mainstream rock, but we enjoy a
dash of metal, a pinch of punk and
a dollop of electro all added into
the witch’s cauldron for added fun,
craic and wonder.
You may have seen us at the
Freshers’ Fair. We did a live set on
the ICRadio stand from two until
three. If you do not remember us,
we were the two guys with appall-
ing haircuts playing out the likes of
The Rapture, The Clash and The
Killers whilst drinking some pints
and shaking our jelly. We hope this
encouraged you to sign up to follow
in our footsteps.
Moon Unit is now in its third year
of operation and since its inception
has managed to become Impe-
rial College’s most listened to rock
show. However, none of our listen-
ers ever want to tell us about the
show. So, before we start telling you
why you too should become a Moon
Uniter, I ask anyone who listens to
get in contact and start requesting
tracks and generally telling us why
we are so much better than every-
one else. Not that we are immodest,
we just state the facts. Though only
the facts that make us look good.
On a normal Moon Unit hour we
each take over the show for a thirty-
minute section, playing exclusively
our own musical choice. SuperDan
normally sticks to the modern day
taking Moon Unit down a road filled
with the delights of 90s’ Brit pop,
some mellow tunes and some turn-
of-the-century metal. On the other
end of the Unit, Essex Boi tends to
stick to the older sounds. The 80s’
post-punk era, 70s’ hard/psych-
edelic rock and 60s’ guitar pop
seem to be the usual choice. The
best in Moon Unit music comes in
the crossover regions. The main-
stream area in which we both like
to delve out musical tastes is filled
with pleasures unknown. When one
of us manages to find a song that we
both like the show tends to hit fifth
gear. Within this limited category
exists the likes of Björk, Bloc Party
and anything but modern R’n’B.
Basically, your staple diet of indie
dance floor tracks and ‘experimen-
tal’ music will be catered for within
our weekly hour of fun and games.
Alongside the music there exists
the infamous Moon Unit banter. It
is the repartee between the two of
us that repeatedly brings our lis-
teners back, begging for more. In
shows gone by we have discussed
everything from the merits of mod-
ern day R’n’B in the vein of those
Beyoncé types (we concluded that
there are none) to the always ap-
propriate subject of coprophilia (I
suggest you Google that word if you
do not know it, but be warned, do
not do an image search).
We like to include a few regular
features in the show. We have had
weekly interviews with pop and
TV superstars Alvin and the Chip-
munks, followed by their rendition
of a famous song. Another piece
SuperDan and Essex Boi: Their parents were fire and brimstone
that often rears its ugly head is
Not On My Moon Unit. This is a lit-
tle ditty where Essex Boi normally
plays out a classic piece of hip-hop,
reggae or Motown that is actually
good, unlike most of the rubbish
from the mainstream ‘urban’ scene.
Finally Dan’s Shit Past involves Su-
perDan playing something that he
liked when he was about thirteen
(Blink 182 etc).
We also regularly run Moon Unit
Specials. This week saw a Hallow-
een themed show that included
songs of a scary nature. Only songs
that contained lyrics of doom and
despair made the cut (except for
Essex Boi’s closing track). This
spookfest included some of The
Jesus and Mary Chain, Nine Inch
Nails and Korn, for all your gothic
metal needs. Next week, though,
will see a return to our usual pro-
gramming selection, what that in-
cludes even we do not know.
Frankly we do not take ourselves
seriously, but somehow have quite
a decent following and we enjoy
ourselves. Over the past years we
found that when it comes to mak-
ing good shows professionalism is
secondary to making the listeners
laugh. So go and download our last
show, it is very good. Trust us.

IC Radio has the gear and the talent to provide you with a DJ and some banging tunes

You are rather lucky to go to Im-
perial, I can tell you this. But not
for any of the reasons you have
heard before. You are lucky be-
cause Imperial College Radio is
probably the best student radio
station around. “But I hear it is
just another student radio sta-
tion” you cry. Now that is just
wrong. I have been told that we
broadcast more hours of origi-
nal programming per year than
most, if not all, of our competitors
in the capital. One of the best fea-
tures on the ICRadio website is
our listen again service. We keep
every show presented in the last
four years and they are all avail-
able for you to download. So if
you visit us at the award-winning
www.icradio.com you can hear
all the shows you have missed
over the years. The main aspect
is for us to create and broadcast
radio shows. A lot of people tell
me that they could never do a ra-
dio show because they would feel
too self-conscious, but even when
the shyest of my friends guest on
my show, they become animated
chatterboxes the moment I flip
the On Air switch.
Are you still not convinced that
you should be a part of ICRadio?
I have more reasons. ICRadio is
mostly filled with music lovers,
me included. But, and this is a
big but, the main difference be-
tween ICRadio and other music
related clubs and societies is the
distinct lack of music fascism.
Any music sits perfectly with any
other type, anywhere on ICRadio
and we intend to keep it like that.
ICRadio has the likes of cheesy-
poptastic School Daze (with
resident schoolmasters Lisa
Bunclark and Seb Kaminski) sat
right alongside the metal mon-
ster that is Iron Thursday, the
brainchild of Flangernon Lacy
and Jurgen Grundleburger. Alex
Baldwin (him from the Nightlife
section) and his buddy Matt Long
come in and play all kinds of odd
sounds that I often find surpris-
ingly pleasant on the interesting-
ly titled Lazer Tiger vs. The Acid
Tripping Swamp Monkeys.
Shows are not our only out-
put. Seb Kaminski is in charge
of running the numerous events
we are hired to do by Imperial’s
other clubs and societies. Folake
Adegbohun runs a music review
team that take all of the twenty to
fifty CDs we are sent every week.
Our members also get access to
our professional recording stu-
dio. Where some minor sucessful
songs have been recorded. On top
of all of this our resident house
junkie, James Yearsley, teaches
the finer points of turntablism to
those who are interested.
Hopefully you are convinced
that ICRadio is the best thing on
Earth and that you want to join
our noble cause. If you are suit-
ably impressed email manager@
icradio.com and I can get you
rocking the airwaves within the
week.

Station Manager
