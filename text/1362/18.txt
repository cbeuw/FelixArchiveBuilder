I, Gamer
G
reetings, welcome
and hello to what
can only be ade-
quately described as
“Felix Games: Beta
Version”. This week, we relaunch
a section not seen for some time
in these hallowed pages. The last
time Felix Games graced this pa-
per, a Playstation 2 would set you
back £170, CounterStrike 1.5 was
enjoying 30,000 servers world-
wide and Wii games were child-
ish things that teenage boys did
in the Gents. Life was simple.
How times change. Counter-
Strike has now seen several
fully-published releases, you can
pick up a PS2 for a fraction of the
cost and size of days gone by, and
gaming is almost – almost, mind
you – cool.
Not only that, but everyone is
gaming now. And as the prize
pot grows bigger, companies are
looking to get as many people as
possible on their side – girl gam-
ers, grrl gamers, young gamers,
old gamers, casual gamers, hard-
core gamers, and – yes - those
people that think that Rainbow
Six is engaging and fun. If you’ve
got a wallet, then they’ve got a
game for you.
But as we discuss this week,
it’s not just your money that the
Industry needs. As the markets
grow wider and the demands
more complex, it’s hard to keep
innovative without fresh ideas
and sharp new minds flowing in.
We take a look at Neverwinter
Nights 2 and Microsoft’s XNA
and ask whether bedroom coding
is a thing of the past.
And hey, the industry needs
journalists, too (or so we like to
think, at least)! Without writers,
this section can’t survive, so if
you’ve got the experience and the
writing know-how, Felix Games
wants to hear from you – the
email address is at the bottom of
this column.
Aside from our themed weekly
features, we’ll also be taking a
look back at milestones and un-
discovered gems from platforms
past in our Retro column. And
we’ll also be looking to the future
in Where Next, which focuses on
the technologies, games and the-
ory behind tomorrow’s industry.
Over the coming weeks and
more, the layout of Felix Games
is likely to change many times.
But we can’t do it at all without
you!
So if you’ve got a comment on
the section, or would like to be a
part of our writing team, please
get in touch. The details are be-
low. Enjoy.

Battle against the franchise
Technology pushes forward year on year, but is real game design a thing of the past?
Game development is big business,
a very big business. With develop-
ment studios comprising hundreds
of developers, and budgets reach-
ing far into the tens of millions of
pounds, we’ve come a long way
since lone programmers tinkered
with machine code in their base-
ments … or have we?
Of course, today’s blockbuster
games provide audio and visual
experiences on a whole different
scale to games of the past. How can
a pixelated two-frame character
animation possibly compare with
3-D models containing millions of
polygons and advanced pixel-shad-
er technology? Given the option,
it’s obvious which someone would
choose.
These amazing visuals come at
a high price, however. Back in the
world of Pong and Pacman, devel-
opment times were measured in
weeks or months. Today, they are
measured in years. The time, effort,
and money needed to create the
graphics players have come to ex-
pect from modern games are vast.
But in terms of the “fun” they add to
a game … is it all really worth it?
The human mind is very good
at ignoring unnecessary details.
Amazing visual effects do a good job
of creating that “wow” factor when
a gamer looks at the back of the box
in their high-street shop. But in the
long run, all these next-generation
graphics serve to do is present the
player with the gameplay experi-
ence in as pleasant a way as pos-
sible. Just like a movie with great
effects is poor if it’s backed up by a
weak plot, a game with weak game-
play won’t hold the attention of the
A gamer’s favourite bedroom pastime
Neverwinter Nights veteran Bryn Davies talks about mods, modules and fame
When Neverwinter Nights was re-
leased back in 2002, it had a pro-
found impact both on the average
multiplayer gamer, as well as the
aspiring coder. The Aurora toolset
enabled both teams and individuals
to create their own worlds, shar-
ing work between a strong online
community.
With the release of Neverwinter
Nights 2 this week, it’s possible that
there’s another revolution on the
horizon. Felix Games talks to Bryn
Davies, the creator of the module
True Colors of a Hero, about how
the tools and the people have ena-
bled him to create a world.
Is TCOAH the first modification
you’ve ever made for a game?
Far from it, though its definitely the
largest project I’ve ever undertak-
en. I started modding back when the
Quake II editor was released. From
there I moved on to Unreal, then
through the series all the way up to
Unreal Tournament 2004. Mainly I
just coded weapons, skinned char-
acters and designed levels. I’m
no 3d artist (I could never make
anything that didn’t just look like a Bryn Davies’ customisations to NWN include an emote system
player, no matter how many pretty
explosions it has.
For today’s smaller developers,
the situation can look pretty bleak.
Without the vast resources availa-
ble to the big studios, they will often
fall flat on their face while trying to
match the visual quality of the latest
blockbuster. The big development
companies would have you believe
it’s impossible to make a hit game
without a team of hundreds and
millions of pounds at your disposal
… and they may well be correct.
Does this mean there isn’t a place
for the small independent develop-
er in a market full of movie licenses
and 2006/7/8 sports managers? Not
necessarily. Things are starting to
change in how games reach their
audience. Traditionally, a developer
would produce a game, and then
start it down the long and treacher-
ous journey of publishers, distribu-
tors, and resellers. If all goes well,
the game will end up on a shelf in
a high street shop, where it’s criti-
cally compared by unforgiving cus-
tomers against the rest of the mar-
ket based on how much “wow” they
can squeeze on the back of a 7” by
10” box – a pretty harsh environ-
ment for a small and unestablished
developer.
But with the advent of online
distribution, games can be deliv-
ered directly to customers who are
able to make much more informed
choices. This new market pits small
developers with new ideas on a lev-

el playing field against the big com-
panies. Over the next few years, it’s
possible that this new delivery sys-
tem could lead to a divide in game
development. There will always be
money to be made in pumping out
sequel upon sequel of a tried and
testing concept by companies who
really can’t afford to take risks. This
could leave the market’s need for
innovative and original games to
be met by the smaller companies
who perhaps don’t have as much to
lose.
For now at least there is a glim-
mer of hope for the gamers who’ve
become disillusioned by the un-
answered call for new and unique
games - small developers with big
ideas have just found a new voice.

out of the question. NWN1 was odd
actually. I left it a while and saw it
with the first expansion in a cheap
bundle. That’s where it all started.
What do you find helpful from us-
ing Neverwinter Nights?
The ease at which you can knock
together a module. Most modules
now use such sophisticated script-
ing and custom content, but to be
honest it’s not strictly needed.
If you’re already able to create a
working adventure, with unlimited
scope for its length and the many
pathways to its end without even
touching a single string of code,
then all you’re left with is the level
design and the story (from which
your gameplay should follow).
The community is fantastic. 4
years after its initial release you’re
still getting people releasing free
content for it. For mod developers,
particularly who aren’t able or con-
fident in producing custom content
for their modules, its fantastic.
Do you think there’s still the ‘bed-
room coding’ ethic?
In some ways the bedroom coding
ethic is more prevalent than ever.
The games industry has entered a
very strange time. The graphics on
games now are just stunning. The
detail on objects and characters
just blows you away. But gameplay
hasn’t moved on that much. We’re
stuck in the same formulas.
However, I don’t think the solu-
tion is to break out of the defined
game genres with every title. I just
think that the elements of game-
play, which have become pretty
rigid within most genres, should be
expanded.
I want to be interested by a game
from the word go, and I want to eas-
ily be able to identify why I should
buy it over another.
There’s no use comparing two FPS
titles when its just going to be a
choice between graphics styling
and “storyline”.
This is where bedroom develop-
ers can and indeed have aided the
professionals. You can take a look
at any PC title that’s had a big net
community follow it and I’ll guar-
antee you that some of those mod-
ders have been snapped up by the
initial games developers. In the
case of NWN1, just look at DLA.
Many of their members left to work
for Bioware. It’s always possible,
you’ve just gotta work hard to get
recognition.
