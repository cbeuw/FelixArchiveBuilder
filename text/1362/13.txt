Deftones
Saturday Night Wrist
(Maverick)
★★★★✩
Albums new and not so new
This week Felix goes over some albums recently released to a summertime record
As soon as the drums kick into the
opener of Deftones’ fifth studio ef-
fort, Hole in the Earth, you know
they are onto a winner. Immedi-
ately the hairs on the back of your
neck stand up as the huge drums
and driving guitars throw you into
the opening vocals delivered so
effortlessly by frontman Chino
Moreno. It is the perfect opener to
the Sacramento quintet’s Saturday
Night Wrist, and what follows is a
mixture of brutal riffs and ambient
melodies reminiscent of the heavily
acclaimed White Pony and to some
extent 2003’s Deftones.
Beware is a crushingly heavy,
slow tempo, bass-driven song
which leads the listener into the
brilliantly-sung chorus. There are
some beautifully melodic moments
on Saturday Night Wrist; from the
haunting opening atmosphere of
Cherry Wave to the vocal perform-
ance by Moreno on the first half
of the final track, Riviere. How-
ever that’s not to say this album
doesn’t rock, the opening sam-
ples of Combat lead into aggres-
sive vocals of Moreno screaming,
“Whose side are you on?”. Rapture
is full of driving riffs and uptempo
drum beats, and the breakdown in
Rat!Rats!Rats! is just plain brutal!
This song alone would satisfy any
pre-White Pony fan.
That’snottosaythisalbumdoesn’t
have its faults, in fact this is the al-
bum which almost broke the band.
Guitarist Stef Carpenter admitted
on several occasions that they al-
most “threw Chino out”, due to him
leaving the recording of his vocals
to tour with his side project, Team
Sleep. Indeed, as with the song
Lucky you on its predecessor, there
is an obvious Team Sleep moment
on Saturday Night Wrist. Pink Cell-
phone features the vocals of Giant
Drags’ Anne Hardy, and seems out
of place on the album. Not so much
a classic Deftones song, but more
of an electronic beat over which
Hardy delivers weird spoken-word
lyrics, at times cringingly explicit
for no real reason. There is also a
guest appearance from System of
a Down’s Serj Tankian on the track
Mei, which again seems pointless
and out of place on a Deftones al-
bum and I feel they could have used
bassist Chi Cheng’s guttural vocals
on the heavier songs.
Overall, Saturday Night Wrist
manages to perfectly balance the
elements of the bands past to cre-
ate an original sounding record in
a time when many of their contem-
poraries are content to re-package
established, and often outdated,
trends. Whether Saturday Night
Wrist receives as much praise as
2000’s White Pony will remain to
be seen when it is released. In my
opinion this album deserves to be
ranked within the top 3 of their back
catalogue.

O
h my sweet Jesus
of Nazareth – the
film version – do
we have a lot of
reviews for you this
week. Sorry about the anaemic
state of last week’s music sec-
tion, I had little time as I was at a
(brilliant) gig and was feeling un-
der the weather. Also, I apologise
for the focus on guitar bands, I
was trying to add a bit of a theme
to tame the excellent yet random
nature of this section.
This week we have some
albums ranging from the new
Deftones album released this
week to an album from the sum-
mer getting some overdue atten-
tion. In these album reviews we
cover alt-rock, metal, indie-rock
and R’n’B. Variety I believe is the
spice of life (along with a pinch
of nutmeg) so if you feel you can
add more variety then whip over
some reviews to us and we’ll put
them in and keep you informed
about our reviewing possibilities.
We’ve also got a singles round-
up, and a live review of blues
great, Walter Trout. I hope this
meaty selection is whetting
your appetite for the bonanza of
content that will be November’s
FeMM or Felix Music Monthly.
Yes, we are staying true to our
word and putting one out every
month. Next week will be when
you can happily pull it out and
study it in front of everyone, and
you can pick up FeMM out of
Felix as well.
For next week we hope to have
more columns, reviews, features
and listings. We are going to dis-
sect music in hideously beautiful
ways for your reading pleasure.
You’ll be baying for more by then
end, and we might give it to you,
you dirty people.
In other news, we have another
Kids Will Be Skeletons gig night
in the union on Sunday No-
vember 5th. If you are stuck for
ways to celebrate the murder of
trecherous Catholics, then come
on down. We want to celebrate
revolution as opposed to repres-
sion on this day. So we have two
bands from France, the original
country of revolution, coming
over to play.
Entry is £3 for students and
£2.50 for alternative music and
jazz and rock society members.
Again the reason for the door
price is to cover the transport
for the French bands. Expect
a riotous night in the spirit of
revolution
This self-named album from the
four Atlanta sisters leaves nothing
to the imagination. It is an un-en-
couraging Jazzy Pha production.
This album has very little party feel
to it. It’s all about boys. Don't wom-
en have anything else to sing about
other than boys?
We have the very crunk track Do
It To It, which basically tells you
to get into the ATL style of danc-
ing and which sounds like a female
and less aggressive version of Lil’
Jon’s Do it To It track. The next
track Chevy throws about slangs
non-Atlanta residents would not
understand. Unappreciated is self-
explanatory and Moment in Time,
the sister do show us a bit of their
vocal ability. My favourites are Stop
Calling – not because I would love
to play this track to all bugaboos but
it actually shows that the girls take
time to sing about the odd things
women experience – and OOOH be-
cause it raises a lot of issues young
teenagers and women go through
in today’s society.
This does sound like a standard
girl-group album; trying hard to
cover all the basics about relation-
ships and recording it, or four girls
who have always dreamt of being
stars. At the end of the day this al-
bum is not great but one would defi-
nitely find something to relate to.

Hailing from Minnesota, USA,
Tapes’n’Tapes offer up a quirky
slice of indie-pop for our listening
pleasures in the form of this, their
debut album. The music itself is
simple enough, just guitars, drums,
bass and vocals. In fact the opener
of the album is called Just Drums
and is easily the best opening track
to an album I’ve heard in a while.
It kicks into life with an infectious
beat and a catchy riff, and when it
breaks down in the bridge to – you
guessed it – just the drums, then
bringing the rest of the band back
in it shows the band at their very
best. It’s so intense and brilliant
when it all comes together that I
usually can’t help but rewind it and
listen to it again.
The album never quite manages
to reach this high again, and indeed
some of the album is quite boring
and a couple of songs miss the mark
and just get annoying after a few
listens. This hit-and-miss approach
does pay off in places though, be-
cause the hits are just that. Tracks
like Cowbell and lead single Insis-
tor really grab your attention with
their foot-tapping beats and curi-
ously hum-able melodies.
Thisisn’ttosaythatTapes’n’Tapes
are a one-trick pony though, and
they demonstrate their versatility
with some slower, delicate, (whis-
per it) ballads. Songs like Omaha
and 10 Gallon Ascots are slow-
burning anthems which provide
beautiful counterpoints to the fast-
paced singles and give the album a
good balance.
Not all of the album works, and
songs like The Iliad seem more
like b-sides than the more album-
worthy material. The singer’s voice
can also be grating at times, and his
high-pitched, almost whiny style
could put some people of the band
altogether.
Overall this album probably won’t
change your life, and it isn’t really
anything incredibly original either,
but it is a very well crafted set of
songs which are fun to both listen
and dance to as well. Hopefully the
band can take the best from what
we have seen on offer here, leaving
behind the rest, and create a su-
perior second album which would
surely be a classic in the waiting.
Until then though – get this, enjoy
most of it and just forget about the
rest.

This being the Kerrang darlings’
sophomore album, a term that res-
onates pretty well with a band that
was once described as playing like
a bunch of fifteen year-olds. I doubt
their fans could tell the difference
though, since most of them are fif-
teen (chronologically or otherwise).
Despite this, you can’t accuse them
of having no ambition; and perhaps
a little too much at that! Now then,
this album certainly isn’t the first in
that general shift by mainstream
metal from the hugely irritating
screamo craze back towards retro-
tastic hair metal, even if this album
is admittedly most evocative of the
thrash classics by the likes of Me-
tallica and Megadeth. The band can
even turn out copycat Kerry King
solos and work in some interest-
ing time signatures at times. It just
makes you wonder what they could
have achieved without such an an-
noying front-man!
Unashamedly my main problem
here is with Matt Heafy. Now he
may have been helped into the sad-
dle by the fact that his dad runs a
record company, and I don’t really
hold a grudge against him for that.
I don’t even get that irate at the fact
he plays the late ‘Dimebag’ Dar-
rell’s old guitar. But I can’t forgive
him for consistently falling into aw-
ful cheese-laden ballads in virtually
every song, or for that matter, the
entire length of This World Can’t
Tear Us Apart. BLEURGH!
Here is where it goes horribly, hor-
ribly wrong: For tonight Matthew,
Heafy is going to be performing as
James Hetfield – a premise that is
neither original nor anywhere near
the original; thus we end up with
some of the worst, wincing, tone-
deaf drawling I have ever heard.
The lyrics on this record, now
(unfortunately) clearly audible,
clearly consist of the kind of hack-
neyed politically-correct moralising
that makes me want to reach for a
bucket.
Because inevitably and here’s the
crunch, Trivium suck – There’s just
no way round it. Trivium really do
give Mr. Dyson something to worry
about; no matter how hard they try
not to (and there’s certainly been
a smidgen of effort here), and defi-
nitely no matter how technically
they can play, it still ends up as an
ultimately forgettable album.
To start with, Trivium need to
learn the definition of irony (noone
really knows the definition – Ed),
as the name itself suggests either
much sarcasm or an inferiority
complex, something that this band
seems to eke the complete opposite
of. On the plus side at least, I give it
to them for having the cheek to try
and make another Master of Pup-
pets, even if The Crusade is nothing
more than Garbage Inc.
