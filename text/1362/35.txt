The IC girls arrived at Harlington
in a confident mood, following a 12-
0 victory in their previous game.
Attempting intimidation tactics
through dynamic stretching prow-
ess is a popular theme of the 2nd’s
matches, UCL were treated to a
special display incorporating goal-
ie-worship routines.
The game began with a solid, if
rather conservative, defence for IC,
lead by Izzy playing a great game
as sweeper and Fi showing us what
she can do if we let her up in the
midfield for a match!
As the game progressed, IC be-
came more attacking, with numer-
ous opportunities in the ‘D’ finally
resulting in a somewhat scrappy
goal from Dasha. The next goal
showed rather more flair, with Da-
sha planting an awesome cross for
Melissa to finish before UCL knew
what hit them.
UCL rarely had a chance to
threaten the IC goal; when they did,
good clearing from short corners
and some excellent hitting from
Bella quickly saw IC back in attack.
Trish and Melissa worked hard on
the left side; covering more ground
than I did in the whole of last sea-
son! Unfortunately most of IC’s
A beautiful performance
breaks failed to reach the stick of a
striker; with a little more organisa-
tion the score line may have reflect-
ed the dominance of IC’s play.
Girl of the game was a difficult
decision and came down to a boat
race between Bella, Fi and Izzy;
Bella won in style to claim the title,
for services to hitting the ball very
hard yet with surprising accuracy.
Twat of the match was an easier de-
cision, and was claimed by Izzy for
a very elegant fall on her backside!
Special mentions go to Mary for
standing in as goalie despite being
unable to move most of her limbs,
to Roxy for letting us have her, and
Dasha for hitting with her stick, not
her head.
Post-match celebrations saw our
captain in a rather delicate state; I
am assured this was wholly the re-
sponsibility of Bella and most defi-
nately not Fi herself.

IC Ladies demonstrate elegance in an unorthodox warm-up routine
The 1st XV were in high spirits
after an impressive performance
against Royal Holloway, last year’s
ULU Cup winners who beat the 1st
XV in the final. Today’s opponents
were another side promoted due
to BUSA restructuring, and were
keen to stamp their authority.
The game started poorly for IC;
the Royal Free forwards were
fired up and were a lot more physi-
cal up front, and after some sus-
tained pressure they managed to
drive the scrum from five metres
out over the IC try line to get the
first points of the day.
This pressure continued in the
scrums and in tight play, but some
poor tackling by the forwards let
the centre over the try line for
Royal Free’s second try.
Only then did IC wake up and
starting playing their own game;
with mouvement général occur-
ring in full flow all over the park,
Royal Free were unable to control
the apparent chaos that was un-
folding in front of them.
However, poor finishing meant
that IC never crossed the line and
Royal Free took the advantage
again by scoring the third try of the
half with a run through the centres.

If only the match were up to the standard of the warm up!
Losing 17 – 0 at half time, IC were
getting fired up for the second half
which saw big tackles occurring all
over the field. Nathan made sure
Royal Free would not try and run
through the centres again by flat-
tening their centre and knocking
him out.
Up front, man of the match Ben
Moorhouse was a machine, tack-
ling everything in sight and mak-
ing sure their forwards couldn’t
get through the side of the ruck
and mauls.
Again, IC’s movement and play
was sensational, particularly from
the backs, but poor finishing and
the forwards were in set play with-
out a proper hooker stopped them
from scoring.
The last five minutes saw ex-
tremely fast play; Royal Free
scored their fourth try, and IC fi-
nally decided to wake up and play
rugby! Up front, the forwards ran
at the opposition with persistent
pressure, paying off with Bo driv-
ing over the line for IC’s first try,
which was quickly followed by
quick hands from the kick off to
find Mike, on the wing, who sim-
ply glided through the oppositions
backs to score.
Although a disappointing result,
the team can take some brilliant
moments of play and take it into
next weeks game against GKT.

IC faced St George’s in their first
home game of a slow starting sea-
son. The game was almost won
before kick off; the reputation of
“Fortress Harlington” striking fear
into medics nationwide. IC adopted
the 4-1-3-2 system, used by Eng-
land to secure the 1966 World cup
final (a match, coincidently, also
played against a load of pricks).
St George’s were so sure of defeat
they turned up forfeiting the game
to avoid humiliation. Captain Skeen
was having none of it, and the Medic
annihilation began.
From the outset IC played with
tremendous flair and skill. Nut-
megs, Cruff turns and Ronaldo-
style step-overs were being served
up in abundance. IC were so con-
fident that Alex “Nuts!” Rybka al-
lowed St George’s to nutmeg him;
the sign of a truly confident football-
er. Even the keeper Frank “hawk
eye” O’Neil (known for his ability to
spot a penalty from the other end of
the pitch) wanted aboard the now
fully loaded showboat. Having re-
ceived the ball from a pass back, he
played it off an advancing attacker
and picked it up again, a move now
known as “The O’Neil”.
IC dominated the midfield with
Jeremy “The Erotic” Lovett and
Sam Rickett, feeding countless
through-balls to Max “I swear it’s
my real name” Steel and Luca
Laraia to chase, testing the soon-
to-be-exhausted St George keeper.
Wide mids Alex “I will only score
stylish goals” Avila and Alex Rybka
gave IC depth of attack, which St
George could barely understand-
let alone deal with. With so much
pressure, something was bound
to give and right before half time
that turned out to be Max’s ankle-
an horrific tackle from a rubbish
medic hacked it of. Frank politely
explained what happened to the
referee, in a language which may
only be described as “Irish”, and
was duly awarded a penalty. James
“The Shadow” Skeen placed the
ball in the boggy, cut up, marsh of a
penalty area as the air grew tense.
The unthinkable happened as the
7-foot keeper, with hands the size of
the goal, saved the perfectly struck
shot, leaving the score at 0-0 at half
time. In the second half, near gale
force winds allowed St George’s a
few shots, against the run of play.
The combination of Mike “The
Butcher” Allen and Scott “Razor”
McKenzie at centre back ensured
chances were kept to a minimum.
The introduction of Tariq “The
Stealth” Melham at half time and
the attacking nature of Paul “not
the shark” Szczesiak gave IC in-
creased width in midfield; splitting
the St George’s defence wider than
a “Master-full” mother of ill repute.
With the time running out, Luca
“The Assistant” Laraia put Sam
“The Scorer” Rickets through on
goal, he finished with Thierry Hen-
ry style. The game was one of the
most convincing 1-0 victories ever,
and the start of the IC 4ths 100%
home record.
It has been eight long, exercise-
free months since the end of last
year’s football season. On Saturday
however, with trials completed and
a new batch of freshers initiated
into (unofficially) IC’s greatest club
and/or society, the veterans of IC
football were finally able to squeeze
back into their footy kits ready for
the battle to begin. The highlight
of the opening round of fixtures
thrown up by the ULU Supercom-
puter was the most intense of rival-
ries – an inter-IC derby.
A 3-0 pre-season friendly victory
for the 5ths in this same fixture,
four days earlier, meant that the
game was sure to be a cracker. The
4th team aching for revenge and
the 5th’s desperatation to prove the
friendly win was no fluke. Even the
new boys could tell how much pride
was at stake in this one.
The 5th team entered the game
with the same rope-a-dope strategy
that served them so well in the ear-
lier encounter – let the 4ths come
at them all guns blazing, roll with
the punches and then bang! Hit
them on the counter. Sure enough
the 4ths shot out of the blocks; un-
fortunately for the 5th team master
plan, this time they managed to
score. Twice.
The first goal, from a great cross
by Sam Rickards, was somehow
poked in at the back stick by a well-
marked Tariq. The second 4ths
goal followed shortly afterwards
as Chris was picked out unmarked
from a half-cleared corner and
a nice run along the by-line was
matched by a cool finish. Oops. 2-0
down. This never happened to Mu-
hammed Ali.
Sometimes, however, football is
about more than skill. A dogged 5th
team managed to reach half time
without conceding further, and
captain Gui’s passion-charged half-
time team talk stirred something
within the hearts and loins of the
5ths.
A changed 5th team started to win
some challenges in midfield and fi-
nally managed to start to pass the
ball about. Early in the second half,
5th team pressure saw a seemingly
fair goal ruled out for a marginal
offside after excessive 4th team
whinging. This only served to delay
the inevitable as James Long sped
through the heart of the 4th team
defence to bury a great shot past
poor Mike Pursey. Barely seconds

IC men play with each other
later and the 5ths had equalised as
Scott finished off a rampaging run
with a neat finish.
Within the space of 10 minutes the
game had completely turned on its
head, as now it was the 4th teams
turn to hang on. They couldn’t quite
manage however, and 5ths captain
Gui completed a magnificent come-
back with what turned out to be the
winning goal, rounding the keeper
and rolling the ball over the line, be-
fore succumbing to a bout of cramp
during his celebration. Ten nerv-
ous minutes remained, but the 5th
team hardcore defending meant
3-2 was the way the match ended.
Frenzied scenes of celebration met
the final whistle as the 5ths gloat-
ed and rubbed their victory in the
faces of the gutted 4th teamers. A
great game from both teams: here’s
looking forward to a great season.
