JUST WHAT in the hell is Charles Clarke, the
president-elect of NUS playing at? (See page one). The
tight-rope exercise of "stretch-the-mandate"? The
instructions given at the Llandudno conference stated
that no platform was to be shared with racists or
fascists and the same motion condemned the "Get
Britain Out" Campaign because it contained racist and
fascist elements. Yet when I spoke to Charles last
Monday, he was calmly sure that he was within the
parameters set out by the mandate. But even he admits
that he took his interpretation right up to the limit —
only the Conference at Scarborough next November can
decide whether that limit was deliberately crossed or
not.

Today sees a new slant on an old idea to add a kind
of novelty to the impact of serious student militancy.
The Overseas Students Committee have decided to
picket the Imperial College Board of Governors meeting
which is planned to start at around 10.30 am this
morning. A petition is being presented to the G B ' s
Chairman, Sir Henry Fisher, in protest at the recent
government announcements relating to self-supporting
students fees increases.
F E L I X wishes the protest well and hopes to have a
full report next week.

Incidentally, there is no truth whatsoever in the
malicious rumour that I got pissed with John Randall
last Monday on cans of Swan lager. And he did NOT give
me an excellent quote which made scandebus reference
to one of the current NUS Executive. And I shall NOT
be printing this non-existent quote in the last issue of
F E L I X this year. So there!

ICU E E C Motion
Dept. of Chemical Eng.
Imperial College
London
14th May 1975.
Dear Sir,
Though I am glad that F E L I X
s h o u l d give prominence to the
important d e c i s i o n taken b y
I C U concerning our member-
ship of the E E C , I feel that the
only l a c k to emerge, i s i n the
reporting of this i s s u e .
Nowhere i s the text of the
substantive motion mentioned,
nor i s any reference made to
actual arguments used i n
proposing this m o t i o n .
In summary, the motion noted
the increase i n potential
markets for B r i t i s h Industry,
the support from men and
countries of p o l i t i c a l learning
for our membership, the improved
terms of membership a n d the
government take-over of B r i t i s h
l e y l a n d .
Amongst the arguments
presented for the Pro-Market
c a s e , i t w a s suggested that
B r i t a i n s sovereignty would be
enhanced through being less
dependant on the U S A and a l s o
world peace would be strength-
ened b y the presence of a
powerful European Community.
On top of these, this country
is i n the grips of a financial
Crisis and needs a l l the support
it c a n get from our neighbours.
The motion concluded b y
condemning the reactionary
actions o f the N U S a n d
instructing the E x e c t o make
certain information for the
Pro-Market cause available and
to communicate to various
press a n d p o l i t i c i a n s , o u r
support for continued member*
ship of the European E c o n o m i c
Community.
Yours sincerely,
T J . D . P y e

H E R E W E are again! It's the high-spot of the week, y e s , you've
guessed it, i t ' s the IF Only column! Of course, I feel very honoured
that the august E d i t o r of F E L I X a l l o w s our humble weekly
intrusions into their illustrious publication . S o it hardly seems
fair to launch into indescrlmate c r i t i c i s m of IC a s has unfortun-
ately been the case in the
p a s t . (AIthough it would give
me something M E A T Y to write
about).
However I think it would be
better to abandon a l l attempts
at profundity and write some-
thing pleasantly mundane,
w h i c h w i l l c o n f o r m t o
everyone's idea of the dumb
secretary, (and isn't it drummed
into our tiny thick heads from
the word go, that the secretary's
duty is to butter up her b o s s ? ) .
Thats about 120 words and
so another 1 5 0 should just
about do
Anyway, w h i l e I'm here, I
may a s w e l l introduce myself.;
I am the R a g R e p , (no, I'm N O T
responsible f o r t h e staff's
clothes) and i t ' s my job to beg,
implore etc" etc to take part in
Rag Week. In other words, a
c a s e of a little gently persua-
s i o n . ( N O B O D Y expects the
S p a n i s h Inqueistion). A l l this
is no e a s y t a s k .
Of course, t h e pathetic,
w e l l , lets be tactful, elite
number of IF students w h o
turn out for c o l l e c t i n g is hardly
surprising considering that
rough ly two-thirds of the c o l lege
commutes from t h e far-flung
realms of Wimbledon, R u i s l i p
etc e t c . But what about the
other third? Y o u may w e l l a s k .
C o l l e c t i n g goes on a l l
through the autumn term and if
you could only manage one
single Saturday out of the rest
of your life, it h e l p s . A l s o ,
c o I l e c t i n g c a n b e r e a l l y
hilarious, and y o u have the
satisfaction of doing something
worthwhile and....Amen to a l l
that!
P S . Would a l l the budding
jpolitians a t IC deign t o step
d o w n from their b o r i n g ,
extremist platforms and D O
something constructive like
the rest of u s peaceable
mortals, w h o realise we can't
change the world with our
radical ideas?

R e deployment Service w a s
set up i n 1969 a n d i s s t i l l the
only nationally operating unit
which concerns i t s e l f s o l e l y
with the problems faced by
those who are so often damn-
ingly labelled " d r o p - o u t s . "
F o r the past two years i t h a s
received Government help i n
order to offer F R E E a i d to a l l
those students d i s c o n t i n u i n g ,
for whatever reasons, from
degree, H N D e t c c o u r s e s .
Information i s available mainly
on employment, alternative
courses, careers a n d grants
but machinery i s on hand t o
help with any careers problem
no matter how obscure.
The E R S i s not seeking to
supplant any o f the welfare/
personal tutor/ e t c f a c i l i t i e s
which exist at I C . B u t it does
point out that certain discon-
tinuing students may feel
aggrieved t o w a r d s the
institution responsible for
having failed him and might
therefore be unwilling to seek
help there .Also, many students
have already left the campus
before learning they are not
eligible to continue with their
course while others are simply
unaware of the facilities
available to them with their
own college or university. For
all such students, and many
more besides, the E R S is a
valuable additional source of
information/advice/help.
So if you know of anyone
who is considering "dropping-
out," get him or her to contact
the E R S at 20, Gower Street,
London WC1E6DP
(01-637 0450).
