GRANTS ANNOUNCEMENT:
CHICKENFEED!
AS ONE might have expected, the grant increases announced by Mr Prentice on Tuesday
fall short of the 40% called by the NUS. The increase of 22% does however raise the
London grant from £ 6 6 5 to £ 8 1 0 . Married women students will now be treated the same as
married male students, and the starting point on the salary scale for parental contributions
has been raised.
C L A R K E C A U S E S F U R O R E
C H A R L E S C L A R K E ; the N U S
of a p o l i t i c a l storm.
The row has erupted because
Mr Clarke appeared a t a press
conference on the invitation of
the Get Britain Out Campaign
Committee a w e e k yesterday.
T h i s action was taken despite
the fact that Mr C l a r k e w a s
under a mandate from the
Llandudno Conference w h i c h
strongly disaproves of members
of the N U S executive appearing
on shared platforms of this
k i n d .
The Llandudno conference
had noted "The umbrella
nature of the national G e t
B r i t a i n Out CampaignCommittee
and the presence of Powellites
and other racialists on that
Committee" and a s a result
instructed the NUS executive
to "appear under no circum-
stances on platforms with
president-elect, i s at the centre
racists and fascists" .
It would seem therefore that
Mr C l a r k e ' s appearance on the
invitation of the Committee i s
in violation of this i n s t r u c t i o n .
Mr C l a r k e contends this a n d
told our reporter that the
particular people with whom he
shared the platform were n o t
putting forward ideas that
conflicted with the attitude of
the N U S on campaigning
procedures with regards to the
E E C debate.
However, there are certain
groups within the student
movement who disagree strongly
with Mr C l a r k e ' s a c t i o n . H e
w i l l probably face harsh
c r i t i c i s m s and possible censure
at the next N U S conference i n
Scarborough next November.
The 22% increase follows
a 2 5 % increase last year.
During the past year the rate
of inflation has increased, a s
have the levels of other wage
settlements.
NUS has described the
increase (which the D E S
claims to be based on the
annual rate of inflation) a s
disappointing though it
welcomed the d e c i s i o n to end
discrimination ;i'gainst married
women. John R a n d a l l , the
current N U S president, has
c a l l e d for a rent freeze to
protect s tudent li v ing s tandards,
as the whole of the increase
would be swallowed up i n the
increase cost of books,
clothing, transport and other
e s s e n t i a l s .
Several V i c e - C h a n c e l l o r s
are reported to fear further
student militancy a s the
Government has failed to give
large enough grants to meet
increased costs of university
and college h a l l s and lodgings.
Rent strikes are indeed i n
progress at s e v e r a 1 univer-
sities .
A c t u a l figures for the new
grants are a s follows with the
current grants i n brackets:
London grant: £810 (£665), a n
increase of 22%; elsewhere:
£740 (£605), a n increase of
22%; students l i v i n g at home:
£570 (£475), a n increase of
2 0 % .
Parental contributions now
start at a r e s i d u a l income of
£2,200 (£1,600).
Whilst Mr Prentice h a s
failed to make a l l non-degree
courses subject to mandatory
awards (he c l a i m s this would
cost £200m.), he has abolished
the discretionary Awards (in
favour of mandatory awards)
for i n i t i a l teacher training,
H N D and D H E c o u r s e s .
Women students w i l l now
be able to c l a i m dependants
allowances for husbands and
children but there i s s t i l l no
change i n the unpopular
practice of a s s e s s i n g a
spouse's contribution.
Warwick Rent Strike Strengthens
The Warwick University Student U n i o n ' s fight against i t s
University administration has finally c o l l a p s e d after three terms
of bitter struggle. The end, heralded b y a high-court injunction
giving the Warwick University administration the right to reoccupy
the telephone exchange and the Senate B u i l d i n g came when 500 -
750 policemen (including 3 0
policewomen) arrived on T h u r s -
day of last week to evict the
occupying students.
The trouble began i n the
Spring term when 800 of the
2,700 students on campus
went on rent strike i n protest
against higher rents. Threats
by the University to render the
strikers i n eligible for exam-
inations aroused anger a n d
resulted i n a U n i o n meeting
voting to occupy the Senate
b u i l d i n g .
B u i l d i n g .
The a t t e m p t s of the
A c a d e m i c Registrar to pressure
students into s u b m i s s i o n b y
s a y i n g that the examinations
could not proceed a s planned
further aggravated the s i t u a t i o n
Obtaining of a H i g h Court
p o s s e s s i o n order by the
University and of i t s serving
to the students added y e t
more fuel to the fire. A picket
was mounted on the Senate
B u i l d i n g by some students and
others occupied the nearby
U n i v e r s i t y Arts C e n t r e . Other
unions within the U n i v e r s i t y
refused to cross the student
picket lines a n d enter the
b u i l d i n g .
The Union had demanded an
end to v i c t i m i s a t i o n but the
question was deferred by the
Senate meeting on Wednesday
afternoon. T h e Student U n i o n '
is taking steps to strengthen
the rent s t r i k e . While the picket
has been withdrawn and the
A r t s Centre i s no longer being
o c c u p i e d . T h i s d e c i s i o n came
after the Senate meeting.
There i s to be a day of
action on the educational cuts
on June 4th and, on the campus.
The Students Union i s a l s o to
investigate t h e U n i v e r s i t y ' s
finance a n d w i l l base their
campaign for 1975/6 on the
outcome of this i n v e s t i g a t i o n .
