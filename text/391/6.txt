IC Choir: 'Jephtha' by G.F. Handel;
and 'Missa Brevis in A' by J.S. Bach.
W R I T T E N IN 1752, ten years after
Messiah, H a n d e l ' s Jephtha is one of h i s
lesser known oratorios; however it
c o n t a i n s a l l the usual Handelian brilliance
and PC C h o i r and their regualr conductor,
E r i c Brown, are to be congratulated on
the performance they gave us last Friday
evening in Holy Trinity C h u r c h . They
were ably supported by a n orchestra
which deserves its adjective " s p e c i a l " .
Particularly noteworthy was the brilliant
trumpet work, of w h i c h Handel i s s o much,
the master. Among the s o l o i s t s Richard
Gandy and John Williams stood out; the
former for his beautifully controlled runs
and the latter for his c l e a r countertenor
v o i c e . The choruses were sung with the
enthusiasm w h i c h we have come to expect
from the choir. One minor grumble w a s
that the audience was not provided with
libretti, making the following of the work
so much more difficult.
The concert opened with the Mlssa
Brevis in A of J . S . B a c h . Unfortunately
the a c o u s t i c s of the church d i d not
stand up to the precision of B a c h ' s c h o r a l
writing and the effectiveness of the work
was s p o i l e d . The B a c h Mass a l s o served
to lengthen the concert to almost three
hours, despite extensive cuts i n the
Handel, and the enjoyment, towards the
end, was marred by people leaving early.

C.R. Hensman: Rich Against Poor
(Penguin).
T H E R I C H and poor in question here
are countries a s opposed to people, and
the book attempts to analyse the theory
and practice of state a i d to underdeveloped
countries. It a l s o puts into perspective
the actual economic status of some of the
non-major countries; it comes as something
of a shock to learn that General Motors
has a greater gross national product than
many 'advanced' countries, including
Switzerland, a n d most of the larger
American corporations completely over-
shadow the underdeveloped n a t i o n s .
Until recently the majority of people
had seen A m e r i c a a s a great, unselfish
benefactor pouring huge sums of money
into helping its poorer dependents strive
towards their own economic s t a b i l i t y .
Attitudes have changed somewhat (partly
due to Watergate) and In fact it emerges
that, surprise s u r p r i s e , U n c l e Sam does
not always deliver the goods a s e t h i c a l l y
as we might hope. Although the book is
primarily concerned with destroying the
myths of government a i d it a l s o presents
arguments a s to how some of the problems
can, in theory a t least, be rectified. The
roots of the problems, however, lie in the
minds of those p o l i t i c i a n s who persist in
believing that the control of natural
resources grants them the powers to toy
with the lives of ordinary people.
Sigmund Freud: The Psychopathology
of Everyday Life (Penguin).
P S Y C H O L O G Y IS perhaps the s c i e n c e
which more than any other appeals to the
average layman, the educated and
I A M writing my first reactions to the
grants announcement made on Tuesday.
It underlines the c y n i c i s m and unfairness
with w h i c h R e g Prentice has ruled the
D E S over the past fourteen months. True,
students at IC have received an increase
of 21.8% on last year's award does not
even make up for the Inflation during '74-
'75, much less provide for the increased
cost of lodging and refectory mea Is a Iready
in the pipeline. True, the married women's
grant has been abolished — but the
s p o u s e s ' contribution remains. T h e fact
that the base level of the parental mean
test has risen from £1600 to £2200 does
not mean that fewer people pay; it means
that larger chunks of parents' incomes
which w i l l have risen by about the same
amount a c t u a l l y go into the parental
contribution. T h i s in turn means that
students who-;have trouble getting their
parents t o pay the contribution w i l l face
even greater problems.
And nothing h a s been done about
discretionary awards — the biggest
scandal of a l l .
T h i s is a "now-you-see-it-now-you-
don't" a w a r d . It may seem a n unnecessar-
ily harsh attack upon Mr Prentice s i n c e
at first sight the announcement appears
to be attractive. If this were October
1974, it would be; but anyone who s i t s
and considers what the pace of inflation
and the cost of accommodation and food
w i l l be in October w i l l begin to wonder
how he or she w i l l manage.
I consider it a c y n i c a l award because
nothing has been done for the worst-off
students of a l l : the students o n d i s c r e t i o n -
ary awards. Instead, Prentice, the
self-proclaimed "militant moderate" has
himself demonstrated the effectiveness
of the rent strikes a n d occupations
mounted by the " b i g b a t t a l i o n s " in the
universities and polys. T h i s , by the way,
answers the c r i t i c s of that militancy, who
s a i d that these tactics gain nothing for
students. T h e D E S has followed the
general policy over the cuts w h i c h I
delineated In a Precipice some months
ago. That is to make them fall hardest on
those least able to afford it, and those
least able to defend themselves —
discretionary award students, adult
education, overseas students e t c . It i s ,
of course, why university teachers have
had little luck so far; they have d i s c l a i m e d
mi litancy.
The tragedy is that no-one wants
disruption,except people who believe that
a student occupation w i l l spark off the
revolution. But the fake moderates like
Prentice are driving the real moderates
who simply want a fair deal for the
education service, to real militancy. L e t
us hope that the interests of the education
service prevail before it i s irreparably
damaged.
I consider it a cynical award because nothing has been done for
the worst-off students of all: the students on discretionary awards.
inquisitive 'man in the street'; probably
because it helps him to understand the
way in which he and his fellow members
of society react in various s i t u a t i o n s . It
a l s o has the added advantage that,
although it is now highly developed, it
does not require any particular prior
knowledge to understand many of i t s
most interesting a s s e r t i o n s .
Hand-in-hand with psychology is the
name of Sigmund F r e u d , and a s w e l l a s
contributing invaluable theories he w a s
a l s o concerned with making his subject
more a c c e s s i b l e to the general public.
T o this end he wrote this book in 1901;
in it he proffers explanations to such
commonplace occurrences a s s l i p s of the
tongue a n d the forgetting of peoples
n a m e s . H e makes much use of actual
examples to support h i s theories, and
the book makes for fascinating reading;
it w i l l quite probably whet your appetite
for further insight into this vast, ever-
growing subject.

Norman Hunter: Professor Branestawm
Up the Pole (Penguin).
IN THIS latest series of adventures
we find our hero grappling with a n
increasingly unlikely series of situations
as a result of h i s incessant, perhaps
some would s a y o b s e s s i v e , flair for
inventing the most bizarre and preposter-
ous gadgetry. T h i s time Professor
Branestawm attempts to startle the world
with machines for producing c a k e s ,
painting flagpoles, making pictures and
printing money. (The only time a vestige
of common sense seems to enter his head).
He even tries h i s hand at railway
building — no need to worry E r i c , it
didn't work!
The stories are very much the same —
Prof, gets a n inspiration and invents a
gadget w h i c h subsequently goes c r a z y .
Just as the inventions are getting
completely out of hand, Colonel Dedshott
and his Catapult C a v a l i e r s always arrive
to take charge and sort out the pandemon-
ium - is there a moral here?
T h i s book is for Branestawn addicts
only.

Scaffold: Sold Out (Warner Bros)
SCAFFOLD — a structure supporting
some weight or even another structure.
Well, in this c a s e , I think not. T h e
band meander limply through mostly
traditional songs, barely supported by
s e s s i o n musicians a n d members of
Grimmes, a group our three heroes seem
to have a partial interest i n . R e n d i t i o n s of
Liverpool Lou, Lord of the Dance and
Leaving of Liverpool are offered for the
listeners palate, even Hokey Cokey is
given the once-over in true party s t y l e .
C o u p l e d w i t h these, are a few not s o
amusing songs by Messers McGough &
M c G e a r .
Overall the effect is somewhat like
blindmen wading through a torrent of turd .
Y e s , the more I listen to this album the
more I am reminded of another term
a s s o c i a t e d with the word ' s c a f f o l d ' —
capital punishment. Lets hope a s far a s
Scaffold is concerned, this album is just
a tempory stage, (geddit?).
A L R I G H T , A L R I G H T , SO THIS
P A R T I C U L A R S P A C E IS
SEMI-MEANINGLESS, OK?
