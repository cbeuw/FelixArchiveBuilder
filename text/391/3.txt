T A L K THINGS O V E R IN A Q U I E T P L A C E
There are times when even the best of us get fed up
and want to talk things over in a quiet place.....
Next to the Sports Centre there's a comfortable flat
w*jere you can always find a friend who will understand.
It's run by students for the times when you need a
confidential ear.
It's called Nightline.
Of course, if you want information or professional
advice we can find it for you, but if all you want is a
chat, that's alright.
Ring up (581-2468) or drop in for a cup of coffee or
tea (8, Princes Gardens) any time between 6 in the
evening and 9 in the morning.
