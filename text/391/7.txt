Nigel Foster
I H A V E B E E N writing this column for two years now and regular readers wi II recall
that throughout the past season I have stated my belief that this i s the finest IC team
ever to have passed through these hallowed cloisters . because I felt that such a n
array of talent might never again be gathered here I had prayed that this side would
leave a legacy that future sides could only aspire t o . T h i s I believe w e have done and
I record it now.
Our season traditionally comprises o three major t a s k s : the London Championships,
the South and Eastern U n i v e r s i t i e s League, and the South and Eastern U n i v e r s i t i e s
Championships .Weset ourselves the target of winning a l l three. The first hurdle of the
London Championships w e had not cleared since 1933 . T h i s year IC won by a mile with
our first team coming home 27 shots clear of our second team and the rest nowhere .
The final t w o hurdles were to be
decided on Monday May 5th and it was a
poignant day for us a l l . T h e S and E
Championships were over 3 6 holes, a
championship that prior to last year's
victory w e had never done remotely w e l l
i n . A s defend ing champions and favourites
we felt confident. A l a s , at the end of the
day w e found to our dismay that we had
lost by 1 shot to Southampton who had
taken 485 shots to our 4 8 6 . The fact that
Nigel Foster had won the nett prize with
round of 7 5 and 7 6 and that E d Clutton
had again taken a gross prize d i d little
to dampen the sorrow felt by a l l at seeing
our dreams dashed after being s o close to
victory.
The league we felt we had comfortably
won a s w e had played a l l of our matches
with only one defeat. T o our surprise
Sussex and Southampton claimed a right
to a share a s although they had less
points than us they could mathematically
have just caught us had they played a l l
of their matches. A s President of South
and Eastern U n i v e r s i t i e s it was my task
to adjudicate in this matter. It Would have
been easy for me to declare us winners
particularly a s w e had smashed Sussex
5-1 when the two sides had met. However,
to give no side any 'hard luck' story and
to avoid a tie I decided to hold a nine
hole putting competition between repre-
sentatives from each side to decide the
i s s u e . T h e c h o o s i n g o f t h e
IC representative did not look easy with
so many gifted putters in the r o o m .
However, once the committee's eyes had
fallen on our bearded Portuguese Intern-
ational John Mendonca, the choice w a s
not in doubt . H e was sitting in the corner,
a g i n and tonic in each hand, r e c a l l i n g
how he had holed from a bunker to beat
the French National Champion in front of
both T V cameras and a huge-crowd (his
listener, E d Clutton, was fast a s l e e p ! ) .
Handing h i s putter to him with the
words " G o get the league or buy us all
dinner" w e pushed him onto the putting
green. There, with the sort of confidence
that only G i n and Tonic drinkers c a n
muster, he ambled round nine holes to
win by one shot in level par. T h e result
can never convey the trauma he caused
his supporting onlookers at the third.
There he held a one shot lead w h i c h he
lost by playing an 'air-shot' at a half
inch putt. T h i s left poor Mike Strickland
paralysed for breath. L u c k i l y C h r i s
C o b b l e d i c k was on hand to poke a putter
between M i k e ' s legs or he would never
have seen the giant putt John knocked in
a few holes later to take the winning l e a d .
Thus in the major three IC tournaments
we w o n two and lost one by a hair's
breadth. In summing u p the season it i s
difficult not to mention the London
University results s i n c e this team w a s
almost entirely made up of IC p l a y e r s .
The Oxford v . Cambridge V a r s i t y match
was a n amusing event for us to read
about a s w e had already defeated both
sides in question prior to their meeting.
(Indeed Sunningdale Golf C l u b has now
cancelled its traditional matches against
these s i d e s and replaced them with a
fixture against u s . ) . On other fronts IC
players are entering many individual
events and E d Clutton managed to win a
major tournament in Wales a few weeks
ago. A s for the future IC w i l l be touring
North in the summer and has entered a
side for the B r i t i s h Universities Champion-
s h i p s , not a traditional fixture a s normally
our chances of victory would be remote,
but this year who knows? (leVus know
what happensâ€”Ed.).
F i n a l l y I end by rendering my thanks
to this year's outgoing committee of Huw
Rosser (Capt.), Bob A l l a n (V-Capt.), B i l l
Calberwood ( S e c ) , and Mike Marx (Treas.)
for the work they have put in this year.
Particularly worthy of mention i s B i l l
CarJerwood who has worked with machine-
like dedication to see that the season has
been run smoothly (and it has!). Next
year with Bob A l l a n a s C a p t a i n and John
Mendonca a s V i c e - C a p t a i n forming the
committee backbone, we can look forward
to another fine IC season and with E d
Clutton a s London University Secretary
we are assured of seeing hatfuls of caps
coming the Queen's Tower way .
