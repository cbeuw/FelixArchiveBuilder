W H E N C O N S I D E R I N G a change in law, one must always beware of "the grass is
greener on the otherside of the hill "syndrome. Certainly the E E C has many faults, but
the anti-marketeers have consistently shown themselves to be suffering from this
syndrome by their inability t o outline a vigorous and p l a u s i b l e alternative.
If you believe that Frogs, Dogos, Krauts and Wops w i l l be the destruction of this
country, and that the solution to B r i t a i n ' s problems is to send home a l l wogs etc, I fear
that there is very little I could do to convince you otherwise, except to suggest a
psychiatrist who is a n expert on xenophobia. Henceforth, I w i l l ignore the i l l o g i c a l
rantings of the extreme right and w i l l only swot at their sort of arguments when they
raise their ugly heads in (national) s o c i a l i s t i d e a s .
In looking at the arguments of the Left, one finds it difficult to see a general theme
to their arguments. Overall, it would appear that their reasons for wanting to leave
Europe are that Europe is only worth joining when it has become a s o c i a l i s t institution
of Utopian proportions, and yet, the s o c i a l i s t s are rapidly becoming the largest single
party in E urope.
Since no-one has Issued a n organised
alternative to the E E C I can only work on
the assumption that if we left we would
go it alone or rejoin (if possible) what is
left of E F T A . Our biggest problem would
be forming regular trade connections— who
would trust us in the long term after
ditching three sets of trading partners in
less than a decade (Commonwealth, EFTA
and EEC)? A country like Britain, whose
trade is based upon importing raw
materials and exporting finished materials
needs a guaranteed market. Our only large
natural resource (North s e a o i l ) is largely
mortgaged, large sections of our industry
run inefficiently, a n d our coffers are
almost empty. If we left the E E C without
a viable alternative we will be bankrupted,
and the p o l i t i c a l extremism (as seen in
Norway) w i l l be explosive here.
Let us consider the main arguments
staying in the E E C : -
1. "That it is a capitalist plot aimed in
particular at supporting the super-
companies." T h e giant firms of Europe,
many of them British-based managed to
grow to their proportions before the E E C
was formed. I w i l I agree there are possible
IN R E P L Y
Mr P h i l l i p s ' article only confirms what
I have s a i d above: there is no workable
alternative to the E E C . . H i s article seems
to suggest that we should leave the E E C
and announce to the world, "We are no
longer capitalists, so please be kind and
trade with us at nice prices!" N o s y s t e m
(unless self-sufficient, w h i c h w e are not)
of whatever p o l i t i c a l persuasion, c a n
progress unless it is prepared to trade
competively — a n idea w h i c h Mr P h i l l i p s
automatically confuses into exploitation.
T o suggest that the Third World h a s
not yet learnt how to remove oppressive
c a p i t a l i s t corporations, a n d organise
itself into trading groups s i m i l a r irit
nature to the E E C , belies the achievments
of the A r a b o i l states, and much of A f r i c a
and A s i a .
The nature of government of the E E C
does not meet with his approval, but does
it seem s o much worse than a n y other
country's system? We c a n rely on people
like Mr P h i l l i p s to petition s u c c e s s f u l l y
the huge European s o c i a l i s t and communist
parties to prevent the possible dangers
he forsees.
/ believe his article only reinforces
the need to say YES to Europe!
dangers if controls are not introduced, but
these controls are best fixed internationally
so that a giant company cannot intimidate
small countries simply because of i t s
economic power. A positive advantage of
the E E C is its potential a b i l i t y to place
controls on business concerns.
2. "That we will lose our ability to
govern ourselves." T h e argument here
revolves round the word " w e " . If " w e "
means the typical B r i t i s h (dare I s a y it?)
worker, then we have never had much s a y
in how our country is r u n . In the European
Parliament, unlike Westminster, virtually
every major political party has represent-
a t i v e s . T h e selection procedure for
representatives i s p r o b a b l y m o r e
democratic than the B r i t i s h s y s t e m w h i c h
left the L i b e r a l party with a handful of
seats in return for a fifth of the votes
cast. Westminster is only up the road
from u s , and y e t for a l l the good that
does us it might a s w e l l be in B r u s s e l s .
I believe this argument c a n therefore only
be accepted by anarchists who don't want
any government or by those w h o have
s e l f i s h nationlist interests at stake.
3. "That being in the EEC strengthens
NATO and encourages a further military
build-up". Just because we are i n the
E E C does not mean we have to belong to
N A T O — eg France is not in N A T O . W h i l e
we have " f r i e n d l y " nations e . g . R u s s i a
v i s i t i n g neighboring friendly nations like
Hungary and C z e c h o s l a v a k i a , perhaps a
military force, however unpleasant the
idea, is e s s e n t i a l .
4. "That the EEC will reinforce neo-
colonial conditions in the Third-World
countries." Y o u c a n bet it has joined in
a group of like-minded nations e.g.
Warsaw P a c t , O P E C (Arab o i l states),
Central A f r i c a n group,etc. I d o not accept
the principle that because our forefathers
exploited a certain country that we should
now let it knock the stuffing out of u s . I
believe it is patronising to suggest that
the Third World countries cannot now in
the main look after their own interests.
5. "Prices are higher in the EEC." /Vof
true! " W h i c h " (May '75) editorial points
out that prices would have been at least
as high outside the E E C .
A Ithough the referendum is a ludicrous
idea, it is important to vote because of
the immense impact the result will have
on our method of government (especially
a "no" vote).I hope having outlined some
of the contentious areas, you will be able
to vote "yes" to Europe with confidence.
r Out side the EEC Britain would be bankrupt"
