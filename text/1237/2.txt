Licences Lengthened
A decision to allow students
the option of living in halls dur-
ing the Easter vacation is cur-
rently being considered.
The changes have been pro-
posed in response to com-
plaints from students and par-
ents inconvenienced by having
to pack up and move out of
rooms in hall at the end of the
spring term. A number of stu-
dents also expressed a wish at
the start of the current term to
move back in to prepare for
forthcoming exams. Southside,
Weeks, Linstead and Beit halls
currently only offer accommo-
dation licences lasting 34
weeks.
Extension of the licences of
residents living in Linstead,
Southside and Weeks halls
have recently been agreed,
which will enable students to
stay in hall for the full 39 weeks
of the academic year from this

Southside: Easter home?
October. Southside halls are
due to close next summer for
refurbishment and a decision
will be taken then as to
whether Southside will be able
to offer students the option of
staying in hall over Easter
when it reopens in 2005.
Beit is the one hall that will
retain its current 34-week sta-
tus, in order to provide stu-
dents with a choice of licence
length and enable the college
to rent out rooms - in this, its
'premier' hall - for conference
use during the Easter vacation.
This helps to generate funding
for the college's residences
refurbishment programme.
David Francis, Deputy
President for Education and
Welfare, has expressed con-
cern that the changes to the
length of Linstead Hall
licences will be unlikely to
make much difference to those
students from poorer back-
grounds, but said that the
Union is committed to ensur-
ing students are provided with
both adequate care and
"cheap, quality accommoda-
tion," for as long as they
require at university.

Four intrepid publicity-seek-
ers have spent the past week
in the window of Harrods m
front of thousands of onlook-
ers in an event promoting a
new range of hi-tech internet-
linked household appliances.
The L G Internet Family
have lived in the windows of
the exclusive Knightsbridge
department store between
10am and 7pm every day this
week in a custom-built futur-
istic 'house', and will contin-
ue to do so until tomorrow
evening. In the style of Big
Brother, the family - which
comprises parents Carl
Newman, a sales consultant
from Leicestershire, and
Sarah Wooster, a counsellor
from South London, with chil-
dren Steve Wilson and Charlie
Parker, students from Milton
Keynes and Leicester respec-
tively - have been set tasks to
do by members of the public,
which have been presented to
them throughout the week by
a selection of celebrity visi-
tors. After the store has
closed, the four have been
able to relax and unwind each
evening in the plush
Mandarin Oriental Hotel,
which - like the Harrods store
- is owned by Mohammed A l
Fayed.
A media scrum met their
first appearance in the win-
dows of the store on Monday
morning, as the event was
given blanket coverage by
local, national and interna-
tional media. Viewers can
track the family's every move
through four webcams set up
within the Harrods house at
www.lginternetfamily.co.uk.
