ACC Annual Dinner
The Athletic Clubs Committee
moved the venue of its annual
dinner this year from the
familiar a n d riotous Union
Dining Hall to the more plush
and more sedate restaurant of
Jury's Hotel i n Kensington.
Reasons for this may have
included classier surround-
ings, the promise of better
food and, most importantly, a
bar which remains open a full
hour after the Union's.
Jury's is a fine example of a
posh London hotel, all set out
to impress American tourists
with its stunning interior and
yet w a s within the budget of
the average union committee.
Ticket prices were further
reduced by generous sponsor-
ship from Shell who should be
applauded for this and every-
thing else that they do. The
hotel also offered us enter-
tainments to go with the din-
ner but the request for clowns
and juggling dwarves w a s
vetoed at the last minute.
Attendance w a s unfortu-
nately thinned by humanities
exams the next day, a remark-
ably b a d coincidence which
was the fault of someone w h o
himself h a d one of these
exams. Despite this, every-
thing else seemed to run with
swan-like smoothness which
belied the frantic chaos which
went on behind the scenes.
On the night itself, sixty or
so people from a variety
sports clubs turned up i n a
dazzling display of snazzy
dressing which was only sur-
passed b y a Shell representa-
tive's full Highland attire
which had to be seen to be
believed. A seating plan that
left nobody adrift from their
mates had been devised and
the large Jury's tables had the
added benefit of letting the
players of different sports
interact i n a non-shouting
manner.
Food and wine were expert-
ly distributed b y the hotel
staff, a pleasing series of fish,
lamb and lemon meringue pie.
According to those w h o could
make the comparison, the
Chelsea Cup Win
Imperial College A team
retained the Chelsea C u p on
Monday 6 M a y for the third
year i n a row.
The Chelsea C u p is the
bridge competition between
students a n d ex-students of
colleges a n d universities i n
London and is held at Young
Chelsea bridge club i n Earls
Court. The team this year
consisted of Ryan
Stephenson, Charles Leong,
Ian Coombs a n d Harriet
Dingier. The event's strong
field contained eleven teams
many of whom were experi-
enced ex-students, b u t a
good performance by IC A
that meant they finished sec-
ond overall, and first of the
current student teams. IC B
team, which consisted mainly
of players w h o only started
playing this academic year,
managed to come eighth
overall, a good performance
given their lack of experience
in competitions. A l l partici-
pants i n the competition
would like to thank Young
Chelsea bridge club for host-
ing the event and John Probst
for directing the competition.
ICU Bridge Club meets every
Tuesday i n Seminar Room 3
on the third floor of the Union
building, from 6pm. E-mail
bridge@ic.ac.uk for details.
Ryan Stephenson
food w a s even better than the
U L U Purples Ball but at about
half the price a n d with a far
more flexible dress code. A
token enforcement of the
Queen's Rules lasted until the
people from Shell discreetly
communicated their increas-
ing discomfort with the whole
situation.
Those dedicated sportsmen
and women w h o had made it
past the rigorous selection
procedure were presented
w i t h their half and full colours
by Tom Pere, head of Shell
recruitment. T w o special
awards were given at the end:
sports personality of the year
G a v i n Daisley - w h o w a s
awarded a bottle of malt
w h i s k y to assist w i t h the
improvement of his legendary
personality and international
diplomacy skills - and sports-
man of the year Tim Harbour
who w a s awarded a gleam-
ing, shiny n e w cup.
Inevitably the evening
descended, downstairs, to the
notorious Kavanagh's Irish
Bar for some hardcore alcohol
tolerance testing a n d subtle
praising of dress choices.
Cheers to everyone w h o
helped with the evening, Shell
for making it financially viable,
Sen for his show of support
and smooth talking the guys
from Shell, Penny in the union
for doing the tickets, Gary
Robinson for not attending,
Jury's hotel for providing us
with seamless service and a
delicious meal, but most
thanks go to Tim for doing a
lot of the donkey work and for
giving me a much needed
sense of urgency. Next year
should be even better...
