Fairtrade Week
felix talk
So, that Fairtrade Week went
OK then? No, it was brilliant!
Students and free, high quality
chocolate, of course it went
well!
Point taken. Last week you
were banging on about
banana growers. Got any
bendy yellow things left?
Condom week has been and
gone.
No, I meant the bananas!
All gone - chocolate, tea bags,
coffee, fruit juice, cereal bars,
brazil nut cookies, geo bars
and divine bars.
And the bananas?
OK, so we didn't get any free
samples of bananas from the
suppliers. Buy your own.
Now you have raised my
awareness I know that buy-
ing Fairtrade goods will solve
global poverty.
Get real.
But I thought you said...
Yes, yes, keep buying the
Fairtrade stuff and kick up a
fuss if your supermarket does-
n't stock any.
So what's the problem?
Fairtrade makes a real differ-
ence to the producers, their
children and their communi-
ties.
Yes, I'm with you...
But the rules of international
trade are stacked in favour of
rich, developed nations.
Like what?
Some markets in developed
countries are protected from
competition from producers in
developing countries. The
World Trade Organisation is
still dominated by the richer
nations. The US is willing to
ban the import of steel from
the E U and UK, what chance
have developing nations?
So if we change the trade
rules then millions of the
world's poorest people will
benefit?
You've got it!
But who makes the rules?
Basically it's the leaders of the
developed nations at the G8
summits and bodies like the
World Trade Organisation.
So, don't say: "I couldn't give a
monkey's."
Do say: "Tell me more about
the Trade Justice Movement
Lobby of MPs on June 19th!"
Thank You
Thanks to all who took part in
the Fairtrade events last
week. Especially to those who
stopped to talk about the
ideas behind Fairtrade. It is
great to know that so many
people are already taking
action.
Special thanks to all those
who helped with the stalls
and to the groups and soci-
eties who lent support. Big
thanks to the Union and Union
Catering for stocking Fairtrade
coffee all week.
Fairtrade/Trade Justice...
What's the difference ?
Fairtrade products are now
just one part of a wider cam-
paign. Last November leading
charities, aid agencies and
environmental campaigners
came together to form the
Trade Justice Movement.
These include Oxfam,
Christian Aid, Cafod, Friends
of the Earth, World
Development Movement and
People and Planet. Not to for-
get the Banana Link!
What does the Movement
want?
The Trade Justice Movement
is calling for a new approach
to food and farming to protect
the livelihoods of poor farmers
and the environment.
It is also arguing against new
WTO plans for utilities in poor
nations to be bought by pri-
vate companies in the devel-
oped world and run to make
profits.
The Movement also wants
new global laws to regulate
the activities of international
corporations.
Why now?
June 2002 is a pivotal moment
for the world's poor. Trade
rules will be high on the agen-
da of three international sum-
mits:
• E U Heads of State Summit:
21-22 June, Spain.
• G8 Leaders Summit: 26-27
June, Canada
• U N World Summit on
Sustainable Development:
26 August - 4 September,
South Africa
These will be the first gather-
ings of world leaders since
September 11. Now is the time
to make the call for a fairer,
safer world.
What's happening?
All the member groups are
supporting a mass lobby of
members of Parliament at
3.30pm on the afternoon of
Wednesday 19 June, with two
ways to take part.
The easy option: come along
and be part of a huge Mexican
Wave of Noise that is going to
roll around the Palace of
Westminster. Bring anything
that will make a loud noise.
Just the ideal post exam activ-
ity or revision anti-stress tech-
nique.
The detailed option: come
along, do the wave, and then
lobby your local M P about
Trade Justice issues.
