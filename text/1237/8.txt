this week
Editorial
I have just spent what seems
like a year doing all that
snakes and ladders business
on the next page, and to be
honest, I really don't have the
time. This is because I'm off to
Holland on a good old jolly
with a bunch of sporty types.
Now I won't claim that I don't
want to go, because obviously
everyone loves to go off on
one and get paid for it, but to
be honest, I might be happier
if the option had never arisen.
Living in ignorance kind of
thing, you see. I'm going
tomorrow morning, and not
coming back until Friday
night, so that's an entire week
of Felixing that I'm going to
miss, which all has to be done
today. A n d I won't be able to
deliver it. Hopefully that's all
going to happen anyway, and
a b i g thanks in advance to
John Stratford.
So where's the gossip, I
hear you ask. Well there isn't
any. I haven't h a d long
enough since my last editorial
to really build up steam and
get myself into yet another
precarious (and sometimes
woman related) position.
My only mild foray into the
world of heartbreak w a s
going to see my ex-girlfriend
in Birmingham. It has been
stated that I w a s m a d for
going, but I think that's more
relating to the Birmingham
aspect than anything to do
with my ex-girlfriend.
It w a s very strange,
because she's a lovely person,
and as such has not torn up all
the photos of us together, and
instead has them (amongst
many other photos) b l u -
tacked up around her room.
Thus, when I turn up to
meet all her n e w friends for
the first time, since they've
been in her room, they all
recognised me. This was very
disconcerting. Oh, they would
say, you're Will, aren't you,
and then proceed to regail me
w i t h a particular anecdote
involving a tape recorder that
I shall never be allowed to for-
get. Not, of course, that I want
to.
Also, upon introduction to
anyone w h o didn't already
recognise my beautiful fea-
tures, it w a s always 'my ex-
boyfriend, Will', which I find
always sticks you with a bit of
a stigma. Why, people ask
themselves, did they split up?
Why are they still friends? A m
I allowed to try and pull him
or her in front of the other. You
know the kind of thing.
Anyway, my point is that one
day I aim to be introduced to
people as 'my friend, Will', or
even, more simply, 'Will', but I
suspect that if that ever hap-
pened, I would get upset and
assume that the girl in ques-
tion w a s trying to hide the
fact that we used to be with
each other.
I think the main problem is
that I'm feeling a bit sensitive
still, so perhaps I should just
go on holiday; but then regu-
lar readers of my column
know all about the trouble I
get into when I go away, so
maybe I'll just stick around for
a bit.
Oops, I'm going to Holland,
aren't I? It's only four days,
but I strongly suspect I'll
come back to find my parents
remarried, a n d my sister
engaged to my step father.
I'm a b i g believer in silly
season, and I am absolutely
convinced that it's upon us
again. However, on the plus
side, there are beautiful sun-
rises to watch with friends old
and new, so perhaps I won't
complain too much.
