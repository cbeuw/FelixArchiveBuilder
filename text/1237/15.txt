IC Boat Club
The 23rd of March saw excel-
lent results at the Head of the
River for the Imperial College
boat club: the first eight fin-
ished 3rd, the seconds 9th, the
thirds 24th, the fourths 73rd
and the novices 96th overall.
In comparison, Brookes fin-
ished 2nd, 12th, 37th, 118th
and 231st, and U L finished
18th and 31st with their only
two crews. A s you can see
from these results w e were
comfortably the best universi-
ty overall, and were also the
second best club in the coun-
try, behind Leander.
The next event w a s sup-
posed to be BUSA, but unfor-
tunately racing on the second
day where our top crews were
entered was cancelled due to
high winds. On the first day
our women's squad were in
action, but a combination of a
crab and lack of time between
races unfortunately resulted in
no medals. However over the
last two weekends w e were
able to race, starting at
Wallingford regatta. Here our
elite eights came second and
third, just losing to a stacked
Molesey crew with numerous
international oarsmen, and the
girls came second in both sen-
ior 2 and senior 3 coxed fours
to Kingston, w h o are fast
becoming our archnvals.
This last weekend saw IC
divide and conquer, with some
going to Bedford regatta, some
to Bourne at Chiswick Bridge
regatta and one eight ventur-
ing across the channel to race
in Valenciennes, a new ven-
ture for the club.
At Bedford there was an all
IC final in the Senior 1 coxed
fours, while the winners of
that race were denied a w i n in
the elite coxed fours as a
result of a clash with their
opposition who refused to re-
row after our complaints.
Bourne at Chwick Bridge
resulted in an excellent win in
the Womens' Novice double
sculls. Meanwhile in France,
on arrival in Valenciennes we
went for a short practice pad-
dle before going to the hotel
that our hosts had kindly paid
for. In the evening there was a
reception at the town hall with
the Mayor, which unfortunate-
ly was largely incomprehensi-
ble due to our poor French.
This did however give us a
chance to meet the
Manchester University crew
for the first time, who had
challenged us for our long-
held top spot in the University
Test Match Result
The first test between
England and Sri Lanka ended
in a draw at Lords on Monday.
In recording their highest
score in sixty years of 529/5
dec, England managed to
save a match in which they
had earlier followed on. After
scoring only 275 in response
to Sri Lanka's impressive
555/8 dec. in the first innings,
the chances of an England col-
lapse and an innings defeat
were high. These fears were
unfounded after a second
innings opening partnership
of 168 by Marcus Trescothick
and Michael Vaughan. This
was followed by solid batting
performances by Mark
Butcher, Nasser Hussam and
Graham Thorpe, which made
the result of a draw on the
final day the most likely out-
come.
The second test (of three)
starts on the 30th May at
Edgbaston.
Rowing League

The next day saw the actual
racing with a 3500m time trial
to decide w h o would go
through into the 1000m multi-
lane final. The time trial went
well with our crew holding
their form well and rating 37
for the entire course. Our tim-
ing of the race gave us 10 min-
utes and 20 seconds, but the
officials gave us a time of 13
minutes and 40 seconds, put-
ting us behind the home team!
However we didn't complain
too strongly as we were still in
the final along with
Valencienes, Dresden, Delft,
Westminster School, Skoll and
Manchester.
After a long afternoon of
relaxing w e boated for the
final (which was the last race
of the day) in confident mood.
A slightly shaky start meant
that we didn't lead from the
first stroke, but by 250m it was
clear that it was only between
us and Dresden for the gold,
with both crews level.
However by 500m we were a
quarter of a length up on
Dresden and this was where
we really settled into our
rhythm at 39 strokes per
minute. A t this point the rest
of the field went backwards as
we accelerated into the final
stages and w e w o n by an
extremely comfortable 7 sec-
onds by the finish, recording 2
minutes and 48 seconds for
the 1000m course.
The boat club is still
extremely active, despite
exams, and is really looking
forward to racing at Womens'
Henley a n d Henley Royal
Regatta.
