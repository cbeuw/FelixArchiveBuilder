Clubs & Societies: Training
This term the Union will be embarking
upon a series of training sessions for newly
elected club and society officers. By now,
most clubs will have elected their commit-
tees for next year and it is important that
the new incumbents receive appropriate
instruction in certain key areas before
beginning their duties in October.
In taking on the mantle as a Club
President, (sometimes called Chair or
Captain) you are responsible to the Chair of
your governing committee, and eventually
the Union President, for all aspects of your
club or society (for example, the Rugby
Club Captain is responsible to the Athletics
Clubs Committee Chairman). These
aspects range from the health and safety of
your members to the financial administra-
tion of your club.
Other members of your committee are
responsible for certain elements of the run-
ning of your club. For example, the
Treasurer will clearly deal with the day-to-
day financial workings while the Secretary
will ensure that the club records are kept in
good order and the proceedings of meet-
ings are correctly recorded. These officers
are all responsible to the Club President for
their particular fields of operation.
The Union has certain duties towards
clubs and societies that it must endeavour
to fulfil; these include providing certain
facilities and resources. Likewise, your club
or society has duties to the Union, such as
complying with current policy and rules,
and conducting its operations democrati-
cally. We want you to have a basic knowl-
edge of all these things before you embark
upon your term of office. This is to protect
yourselves, your members and the Union. It
will also make your lives and ours much
easier come the start-of-term rush.
You should have been notified of your
designated session by the outgoing com-
mittee of your club or by the Chair of your
governing committee. The new President,
Treasurer and Secretary (or equivalent) of
your club are expected to attend. However,
we understand that with exam season
upon us your availability will be limited.
This is why we are offering a number of
sessions, should you be unavailable for
your designated session. If you wish to
transfer to a different session, please
inform the Student Activities Coordinator,
Nick Gore (n.gore@ic.ac.uk), of the session
you would like to attend. Due to numbers,
please only do this where necessary. It will
benefit you to attend the designated ses-
sion with other clubs of your type.
The format of the sessions is as follows:
an initial introductory session (40-45 mms)
covering general aspects of running a club
will be followed by free refreshments. The
final two hours will be divided into four
short sessions covering finance, health &
safety, running events and
sponsorship/marketing. You will be divid-
ed into four groups for this, moving around
different rooms so that you attend each
session. Although your initial reaction
might be that not all the sessions will be
appropriate to you, I'm confident that you'll
find something for everyone contained
therein and hopefully it will give you the
confidence to try something new as part of
your club's activities.
Finally, a reminder that the training is
compulsory, for the reasons outlined above.
However, it's not supposed to be a chore,
and I hope and expect that you will find it
useful and that it will give you the confi-
dence to lead your club effectively next
term. Rob
PoetrySoc: Readings
When you hear someone talk
about poetry, what goes
through your mind? Usually
people imagine the school days
when teachers would thrust
upon them some complicated
lengthy pieces that are just too
tedious. But really poetry is not
like that, it should be appreci-
ated for its beauty, its musical
and rhythmical quality and its
unique way of portraying
things in another dimension.
This is what the Poetry
Society is about. There is no
need for intimidation, everyone
is welcome whether they fancy
themselves as the next Poet
Laureate or it's the first time
they've written something.
Just come and read, and share
it with everyone. There is no
obligation to read, people can
come and support, and just
enjoy the relaxed chilled
atmosphere and absorb the lit-
erary inspiration that will be
floating around!
There is scope for literature
as well, in the name of prose.
Music will also be an important
feature with there being a
background tempo for the
readers.
So what are you waiting for?
come to the next meeting of the
Poetry Society. You'll see poetry
in a different way, in other
words... you'll be enlightened!
Or, in other words:
"Ever pondered the meaning of
life wondering why you're here
on this earth?
Looking for answers to the
questions you have and put-
ting a value on your worth?
Don't worry for you're not
alone,
Many others share your philo-
sophical zone!
Does the sound of rhyming
words or prose,
Bring a tingling sensation to
your toes?
Or the art of making a verbal
recipe make sense,
Make your muscles go oh so
less tense,
Because you feel so relaxed
and at ease,
As for the door to your answers
you've found the keys.
Then my friends the Poetry
Society's for you,
With literature, philosophy and
music too.
Don't worry, you don't have to
be like the Bard,
Or even have to try very hard.
Speak your mind, a few words
of what you think,
Or delegate a speaker in case
you go pink!
Come and listen and get a hold
of the vibe,
A n d become a member of this
versification tribe.
Attend with an open mind in
this ambience of chill,
A n d be inspired I'm truly sure
you will!
So whether your love is like a
'red red rose,' or you're a fan of
the Jaberwocky,
Just come and be a part of this
auspicious Poetry Soccy!"
