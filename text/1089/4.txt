JCR refurbishment plan in doubt
NEWSTEAM
The future of the Junior Common
Room hangs in the balance today as
College officials begin a series of
meetings to discuss plans for its
refurbishment.
Following years of neglect, the
JCR has fallen into disrepair. The
seats-covers are torn, the decor is
tatty and the lighting is poor, leading
some students to declare it "the eye-
sore on the walkway."
Speaking to Felix, Ian Caldwell,
Director of Estates, admitted "The
JCR is certainly not what it should
be... of all the student facilities it
needs the most improvement." Plans
due to be drawn up by IC Estates
Design Office may include the relo-
cation of the QT snack-bar, possibly

to a more conspicuous site on the
Sherfield walkway. Furthermore the
wall of the JCR adjoining the walk-
way may be recessed, in an attempt
to alleviate the bottleneck at the main
common room entrance. M r
Caldwell commented "We want to
keep the JCR as a flexible space, but
improve the environment."
At the time of going to press it is
not yet clear where funding for the
project will be found, unofficial esti-
mates of the cost approaching Â£400
000. In the past, JCR refurbishment
has been paid for by a combination of
IC Estates, IC catering and IC Union.
If, as precedent would suggest, the
Union is asked to contribute as much
as a third of the cost, negotiations
may stall. The 'Memorandum of
Understanding', which outlines areas
of the Union's responsibility, would
suggest that the Union is under no
obligation to pay for improvements
to the JCR, which is College-run.
Union officials may be reluctant to
part with such a significant fraction
of ICU's development reserve before
finalising details of improvements in
social facilities in Beit Quad, planned
for next year in anticipation of the
medical merger.
IC don appointed charity chief
M A T T H E W B E N N E T T
Dr James Deutsch, a Silwood park
lecturer, and expert on cichlid fishes
in lake Malawi, has been appointed
Chief Executive of Cruisaid, a
London based AIDS charity.
Dr Deutsch, who is himself HIV
positive, applied for the job after vol-
unteering for another AIDS charity,
the AIDS treatment project. He left
his job as lecturer in biology to start
the new job on 1 May, but will
remain connected to Imperial as an
Honorary Lecturer whilst working
for Cruisaid. He will work for a trial
period of six months, with the option
of an extended contract covering sev-
eral years.
From studying the explosive evo-
lution of lake Malawi cichlids, Dr
Deutsch finds himself at the head of
one of the largest AIDS charities.
Crusaid aims include increasing the
public awareness of AIDS, removing
the stigma attached to carriers of the
disease, raising money to improve
the quality of life for HIV and AIDS
patients and helping them to main-
tain their dignity and independence.
The charity supports institutions and
charities, providing hospice and
respite care and furthering research.
Crusaid also funded the creation of
Britain's largest HIV clinic, at the
Chelsea and Westminster hospital.
The charity is further hoping to raise
one million pounds to expand the
centre into become "the first truly
integrated and HIV patient treatment
and research centre."
Recently, the charity merged its
hardship fund with that of the
Terrence Higgins Trust. Dr Deutsch
has reiterated his commitment to
working in close conjunction with
other HIV and AIDS charities, with
the aim of establishing a "unified
agenda for meeting the needs of peo-
ple with the disease in light of
improvements in treatment."
On the subject of treatments, Dr
Deutsch is positive about the new
'multi-drug' treatments now avail-
able, which have been shown to pro-
long life, especially in cases where
the disease is diagnosed early. Dr
Deutsch has stressed the need for
reliable, effective treatments; with-
out them, many potential sufferers
see little or no benefit in taking an
HIV test.
Dr Deutsch spoke to Felix about
his hopes and aspirations for the new
job. He sees himself taking on such
diverse duties as "welcoming people
to charity benefit dinners and theatre
openings to working with other
AIDS charities and agencies to meet
the needs of people with HIV and
AIDS as the epidemic changes in
light of new treatments." Dr Deutsch
has already been interviewed on
radio concerning himself, his
appointment and AIDS as a whole.
Dr Deutsch applauded Imperial
Queers (IQ) for their efforts in keep-
ing the Imperial community
informed about the disease. He
added that while IC students seem to
know about the dangers of unsafe
sex, the number of new HIV cases is
rising rapidly among young people.
He places great importance on safer
sex campaigns, concluding that
"condoms really are the solution to
life's ills!"
Dr Deutsch urges everyone to take
part in Britain's largest HIV and
AIDS fundraising event, 'Walk for
Life', taking place on June 8. The
10km sponsored walk in London
(with similar events happening
across the U K ) is still open for regis-
tration.
