IC stalks Oxbridge in Times league
ALOK JHA
Last Friday, The Times published its
annual league table for British uni-
versities and, once again. Imperial
College came in third after the
heavyweight Oxbridge contingent.
However, recent improvments at IC
have dramatically cut the lead of its
nearest rival, Oxford, from over 120
points to less than 80, with the
London School of Economics clos-
ing on the 'top two' even faster.
Hie rankings are compiled on the
basis of a number of key statistics for
each University, including library
spending, accommodation, research
and teaching. Published results for
each section are ranked and then the
highest performer is allocated 100
points. The remaining Universities
then receive points based on their
performance relative to the best. The
•eacbing and research grades are cal-
culated slightly differently; each of
tee is based on the grades recieved
by different departments in the asses-
excercises carried out earlier
year, and in these Imperial made
strong showing.
The teaching points are weighted
^1tothe research points. This year
&o sees the inclusion of upper sec-
into the degree classifications

ences in awarding policies of differ-
ent colleges", according to The
Times.
Imperial scored a total of 854
points out of a possble 1000, narrow-
ly beating the L S E which scored 849.
The only other University of London
colleges in the top twenty were U C L
and King's with totals of 804 and 740
respectively.
Individual section scores for
Imperial varied but most saw an
increase over last year. IC's large
population of researchers meant that
our staff-student ratio was graded, as
last year, at a perfect 100 whereas
IC's lowest score, 67. was again that
for accommodation. This is a signifi-
cant improvement on last year's
score of 34 but remains among the
lowest for the top 50 universities.
Other London colleges fared little
better in this category, reflecting the
deficit of Hall provision and inordi-
nate rents facing students in the capi-
tal.
Other major improvements over
last year include the 39 point increase
in library spending, raising this
year's total to 83, and bringing it
more in line with spending at other
top universities. Encouragingly,
graduate destinations was rated high-
ly at 94 - again one of the highest in
the table.
The annual publication of The
Times lists again raises questions as
to the reliability and credibility of the
rankings, especially given the dra-
matic changes in higher education
prevalent over recent years. The way
scores are calculated has, in the past,
been accused of intrinsically favour-
ing Oxford and Cambridge, with
some commentators pointing out that
the quality of accomodation offered
by a University, and the amount it

Candidates mysteriously appear for third race
JITEN PATEL
"o* that the presidential race has
°*ed off for the third time it seems
we are finally going to have a
^re of candidates, ranging from
|G president M o Dulloo to Richard
^•ien, a third year geology student,
* five candidates so far putting
9 names forward.
°4er candidates that have
declared their intent so far include
Laurie Tweedale, former Operatic
Society chair, A l Hussein, who
dropped out of the last round of elec-
tions and Despina Crassa, Overseas
Societies Committee chair.
Although not all the candidates
have yet gathered the required 20
seconders they are not expected to
fall short o f the quota, but unusually
M r Dulloo has not yet been officially
proposed. Speaking to Felix, he
declared that "I have a personal list
[of proposers] that I am considering".
M r Dulloo considered his closest
rival to date as M s Tweedale saying
that "she would be very competent in
the job" and that "it should be an
interesting battle."
With most exams over or coming
to a conclusion, the number of candi-
dates running could rise further still
creating a more exciting and compet-
itive race. Other possible candidates
include Paul Brown, current IC
Radio chair, who has been given
leave from his PhD supervisor and is
still "seriously considering standing."
Rumours persist of yet another candi-
date appearing from across the Park.
