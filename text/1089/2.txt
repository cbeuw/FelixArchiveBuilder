spends on its libraries are not factors
which necessarily have any bearing
whatsoever on the value of the
degrees it awards.
It could be argued, for example,
that science and engineering courses
do not, by their very nature, require
the same level of library provision as
humanities courses. In a computing
department, it might be difficult to
distinguish directly between spend-
ing on libraries and spending on
computing facilities as reference
sources increasingly move on-line.
Perhaps a better criterion might be
the amount spent on teaching labora-
tories, with libraries counting as
'labs' for students on humanities
courses.
Also under fire is The Times' prac-
tice of weighting scores in different
categories up or down in calculating
the totals and so in awarding the final
rankings. It could be argued that cri-
teria which have little direct bearing
on teaching quality, such as accomo-
dation and library spending, should
be weighted down, while staff-stu-
dent ratios and graduate destinations
should make the most significant
contributions to the total. Indeed, a
judicious choice of weightings to the
different categories can produce a
very different ranking, as the Felix
analysis below and right shows.
These reservations aside, The
Times rankings are held in high
regard by schools and graduate
recruiters. If Imperial is seen as a
'poor' third by some, this reflects the
low public profile of the College
rather than any failings in teaching
standards.
IC scoops gold!
OUR OWN STATISTICIAN
In a startling revelation this week,
Felix can reveal the long-awaited
results of its annual survey of univer-
sities, colleges and institutes of high-
er education. The league table
(below), based on careful theft and
manipualtion of other people's statis-
tics clearly show that Imperial
College has come up trumps again.
The annual back-slapping award
fight was closer than usual with the
top three institutions clustered within
three points of each other. In a depar-
ture from previous year's calcula-
tions, extra weight has been given
the crucial academic value oft
staff-to-student ratio. This along il
Imperial's top teaching assessrnt
scores have helped IC leapfrog
Oxford and Cambridge and taket

year are rumoured to include N

News in Brief
MEDIA MENTIONS
The controversy surrounding the
examinations marquee attracted
nationwide media attention last
week, with stories in The
Independent and Europe's largest
student newspaper, London Student.
ICU President, Eric Allsop, and
Publications Board Chairman, Robin
Riley, were interviewed live on GLR
FM. College representatives were
invited but did not attend.
NO WELLCOME FOR LAB
REPORT
A report backed by all the major
research funding bodies, calling for
action on the 'chronic' state of many
University laboratories, will not be
endorsed by the Wellcome Trust.
Wellcome maintains that Uni-
versities themselves should cover
overheads on research funded by the
Trust. The report will be submitted to
the Dearing Inquiry on HE.
