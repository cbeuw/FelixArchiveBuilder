Orange has changed the face of the mobile communications
industry. Not only have we introduced an entirely new marketing
approach, we're setting new standards of quality, innovation and
added value in digital telecommunications engineering.
As technologies continue to evolve and interconnect, so the
possibilities expand in voice, data and text communication.
At Orange, we look for engineers with inquisitive minds who
can deliver imaginative solutions.
In every sense they are in the front line of the business, focusing
their skills in a number of key areas, from network design and
planning to handset development, intelligent networks and
network operations.

For graduates in Telecommunications Engineering, or
Electrical/Electronics Engineering with a telecoms
content, the message is loud and clear.
The future's bright. The future's Orange.
