Love and Other
Catastrophes
Originally reviewed in Felix
1084, the release of Love
and Other Catastrophes
was delayed at the last
minute for some reason or
another. Made for around
Â£20,000 this first film by 23
year old Emma-Kate
Croghan features a day in
the life of five Australian
students. Every element of
student life is included,
from searching for accomo-
dation and sex to trying to
dodge lecturers owed
work. Unfortunately the lack
of money behind the film
sometimes shows and
there's not that much to it,
but the characters are all
endearing and ifs an
amusing way to while
away an hour or so.
The Relic
The most decapitations
since Highlander and a
Poseidon Adventure-esque
escapade combine in this
gruesome thriller. Chicago's
Natural History Museum is
the setting for a battle of
wits belween an evolution-
ary biologist and the
"Kathago", an evil DNA
concoction of reptile, insect
and human. Humourously
handling extremely
macabre scenes, including
beheaded victims, this is
suprisingly enjoyable stuff.
The cat-like monster, when
it finally comes out from the
shadows, is refreshingly
different to the usual varia-
tion on Alien, and would be
cute if it didn't have such a
fondness for certain parts
of the human brain.
Despite a slightly disap-
pointing ending, the joyous
way in which each victim is
dispatched means this is
recommended therapy for
exam stress.
Absolute Power
takes real moral
corruption in the
highest echelons
of American
government and
turns it into a
digestible thriller,
in which Clint
Eastwood proves
once again that
he is much more
than Dirty Harry
and The Man
with no Name".
Luther Witney is
an ageing cat
burglar, and is
set for one more
high profile theft
to end his
career. His tar-
get is the vault of
Walter Sullivan
(E G Marshall),
the richest man in Washington and the financial backer of
the recently elected president Alan Richmond (Gene
Hackman). Witney's plan goes well until he sees Sullivan's
wife with an unexpected visitor, the President. While
watching the Iwo he witnesses a bizarre murder, and an
extremely amateur cover-up.Witney becomes the prime
suspect in the murder investigation; the police, lead by
homicide detective Seth Frank (Ed Harris), want to question
him, while the secret service want to remove him since he
has seen far too much.
Absolute Power starts and ends well, but unfortunately
a subplot con-
cerning Witney's
estranged
daughter is
added to show
he has morals
despite being a
thief. At times
Witney's antics
are slightly out-
landish, entering
his daughter's
and Seth Frank's
houses with such
ease that you
wonder if their
front doors were
purposefully left
open. He also
sneaks around
the White House,
donning an
awful fake beard
and moustache,
in order to leave
taunting messages to those who committed the crime.
Gene Hackmans' gives an impressive portrayal of the
disturbing President as his henchmen cover up this incon-
venience. He stands in front of the nation openly support-
ing the bereaved and the apprehension of the culprifand
he has no qualms in ordering the execution of a witness
just in case she knows too much. Both characters are
similar to those portrayed in Unforgiven, the reformed
judging the immoral. After the initial tension, the film's
pace slacks until right at the end, when it finishes amaz-
ingly abruptly. Magpie

Gridlock'd provides a refreshing change to many of the
stereotypes found in films at the moment. It features drug
addicts, but they're neither glorified nor patronised. Ifs
about two buddies, one black and one white, but ifs the
black bloke thafs the level-headed sensible guy and the
white one thafs the crazy ass dude.
The two are Tim Roth and Tupac Shakur, playing Stretch
and Spoon. If they sound like a jazz band thafs because
they are, along with Cookie, Spoon's girlfriend. When
Cookie OD's and ends up in a coma the Iwo friends
decide that ifs finally time to kick the habit and get clean,
and the film tracks the day that follows. A series of mix-
ups means they are also wanted by the police and two
villainous dealers but there's something even tougher in
the way of finding help - the System. Bureaucracy. Forms.
Queues. More forms. Spoon takes his mate under his
wing as they search for the Holy Grail - rehab.
Falling somewhere between a comedy and cutting
social commentary, Gridlock'd is an impressive directorial
debut by Vondie Curtis Hall. He extracts believable perfor-
mances from his stars and has created a very individual,
stylish film. Much of the sardonic script is spot-on and he
combines this with some truly hilarious moments. At one
point the only way the friends can get into hospital and
hence rehab is to have a critical injury. As a result Stretch
has to repeatedly stab his pal with a blunt pen knife in a
scene reminiscent of Pulp Fiction's needle-into-heart clas-
sic, but far funnier.
If there is one criticism of the film ifs that ifs slightly
lightweight, with too many shots of the duo fleeing from
the police and wandering the streets, rather than devel-
oping the plot. However, ifs still a very enjoyable film, if
only for the great dialogue in places. Chris
