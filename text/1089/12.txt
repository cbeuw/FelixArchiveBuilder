GUIDO
Unsophisiicates
I'm going to confess right now that I think I was
the wrong person to review this band and I
have an unpleasant feeling that I'm about to
pan an album that a lot of people will like, still
here goes.
Guido is one of those albums that no-one
can classify so it gets thrown into the trip-ho
bin and finds itself nestling uncomfortably
between Lamb and Massive Attack. The music
on the album meanders around to an alarm-
ing degree stumbling from the quite nasty jazz
tinklings of Pervert to the far more trip-hop
leanings of Straitjacket and even a kind of bas-
tard funk on Riverbank. The universal factor in
these songs is the vaguely irritating voice of
Neal Smart which drawls its way from harsh
distortion, created by singing through a mega-
phone no less, to straight singing. There are
also a lot of instruments here, leading to points
where the songs are suddenly invaded by
embarrassing blasts from horns and other
songs where where it seems like there are
hundreds of instruments vying for your atten-
tion.
The album is not entirely without merit, how-
ever. The band are at their best when subdued
and vaguely ominous. This leaves us
l with an album that is predominately
jazz music of the most rambling kind
a sort of hideous Portishead-lounge
music abortion. I can't really recom-
mend this to anyone unless you like
Freakpower, in which case you are welcome to
it...{4).
Your little sister may want to be in the spice
girls but Kenickie are the band you always
wanted to be in, with the songs you always
wanted to write. The larger than life Lauren
Laverne, Marie du Santiago, Emmy-Kate
Montrose and Johnny X are here espousing
the joys of glitter, PVC (its waterproof) and black
cherry lipstick. They have blazed a trail of
destruction through the interviewers brave
enough to take on
these mouthy
geordies. In their
own words they have
style and they have
class; they have cred-
ibility too, already
having recorded a
session for John Peel.
Yeah, yeah, they are
probably younger
than you as well.
Where have you
been hiding if you
haven't already
jumped around your
bedroom to their
many shouty punk-
pop singles such as
Punka and In your
Car? The album At
The Club contains yet
more songs fizzing along with handclaps,
thighslaps, personality and wit. It is produced
by John Cornfield who has also worked on
Supergrass' albums, and it shares the cap-
tured youth of / Should Coco. There are slow
introspective moments such as How I was
AT THE CLUB
Kenickie
made on the album and although they provide
balance and depth these are slightly weaker
tracks - can we believe there are tears behind
that all consuming confidence? It is wrong to
list influences (although they claim The Monies
and Aerosmith) or comparisons, Kenickie just
are Kenickie. They aren't pushing back the
frontiers of music, but
they are somehow
still brilliant. The hid-
den 15th track cap-
tures there true spirit -
Lauren descending
into giggles whilst
singing of love over
fishnet tights.
It does not take a
genius to predict a
star-spangled future
for Kenickie - and
many have. Their
songs reflect rather
than rely on their
teenage years and
should grow with
them. They will tour a
bit now, be pushed
overseas, experience
more life, turn 20,
then produce another album - it will be mind-
blowing. In the meantime Kenickie are
teenagers and I'll just go and listen to true girl
power just one more time....(9)
Speedyj
Hardboy - Hazel's Hob
Polly Harvey-sounding track that sways with a
foreboding passion.
Ballroom - Take It
They fit perfectly within the sexually ambiguous
category ofbands such as Suede, SJa^elove
etc and, unsurprisingly, sound proily similar

Radiohead - Paranoid Androi
They're back! And they haven't let us down.
This is a cracking single whose tune jumps
about with uncaring audacily, but grows on
you nevertheless. Nearly made choon of the
week, but not quite.
Vitro - Orange
Sounds like an attempt at Jesus Jones.
Mediocre at best.
Nick Cave - Are You The One I've Been
Waiting For?
Typically moody and oppressive. Underladen
with a piano backdrop. This lament deserves
recognition amongst other great emotional
ballads.
Northern Uproar - Any Way You Look
Fairly light-weight standard britpop fare.
Rockier B-sides are better.
Tindersticks - Bathtime
*ing weird! Imagine Barry White singing a
p song, backed by an orchestra.
Jason
Empirion - b.e.t.a.
I normally spit in the face of techno but, horror
of horrors, this is not too bad. Nice and light.
Scala - Slide E.P.
Sub-standard techno/trip-hop which has noth-
ing new to to offer. Tedious.

Foil - Are You Enemy?
Quiet bit. Loud bit with pointless screaming.
Quiet bit. Loud bit with pointless screaming.
Quiet bit...
Bertie Serveert - Co-coward
Pleasant rock ballad with delightful vocals.
