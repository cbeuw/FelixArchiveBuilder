m Have the words 'long
awaited Prodigy album'
* become tired and useless words in
your vocabulary? Do you feel a dull ache in
the back of your head any time someone asks
you if you know when /'/is coming out? Well,
prepare for a date. Yes, after more speculation
and bated breath than someone who is wait-
ing for the return of Elvis, we can tell you that
the Fat of the Land will be out on 30the of June
(yes, this year). Probably.
If you enjoyed that little gem, then here is
another one. Ian Brown is underway on his
solo project. Things are not completely simple,
though. 'Who else is playing on the record?',
OCTOPUS
The Borderline
you may ask. Well, none other than former
band-mates Mani and Reni. The working title of
the album is Under The Pavement The Beach -
something to do with the French riots in the
1960's, apparently. Brown also needs to find a
record label to release his stuff on after Geffen
dropped him last year when the Stone Roses
broke up.
Talking of album releases, Oasis are due to
give theirs to the world in a few months. Be
Here Now will be released on the 18th of
August and will be preceded by a single
release in July.
Radiohead have added more dates to their
tour in September, so if you didn't get a chance

known as Beck's video director, is about to
release the film that inspired Beck's hit Loser.

KHALED + ANOKHA
London Astoria
ther silly
Having never heard of either Khaled or
Anokha, I had absolutely no idea what to
expect of the show. I had been informed by m
y
Northern African Correspondent that Khaled
was an African singer currently living in exile.
As for Anokha, I was led to believe that he
would provide a more ambient sound spiced
with tablas.
The Astoria had magically been transformed
into a temple filled with a heaving throng of
rampant worshippers celebrating an alien
form of music which clearly made their ears go
pop. This is a venue where, mere days ago, I
had been witness to the traditional rock n' roll
valhalla where Faith No More were playing
one of the gigs of the year. There were circles
of short blokes dancing around each other
with their arms raised above their heads to
make them look taller. There were tall blokes
with other tall blokes on their shoulders and
even in the upper circle, people were trying to
reach higher, dancing on the tables and gen-
erally strutting their stuff and all shouting '1,2,
3 Vive L'Algerie!' And this was between
songs...
Given such a friendly crowd, the two acts
could hardly fail and they didn't. DJ Anokha
played a solid set of crowd-pleasing anthems
which would clearly have guaranteed a good
response at various Algerian equivalents of the
Hippodrome. Musically, it sounded like a com-
bination Latin and African rhythms with a
thumping beat and a collection of chant-be-
happy choruses. The mood was that of a sum-
mer carnival in a carefree tropical location in
the sun.
The tempo slowed a little as Khaled took to
the stage with his nine-piece band, but the
song remained the same. Maybe because
these are the only references that I have but I
felt that a lot of the songs had the potential to
burst into a chorus of Yeke Yeke or swing into
the the Lambada.
World music, Worlds apart.
