FELIX FRIDAY 3 0 T H M A Y COLUMNS 17
Westminster Eye - Hamish Common
Last Thursday,
* 111 Mr Blair invit-
ed Mrs Thatch-
i r% er round to 10
Downing Street for advice on policy
and strategy. In most other jobs,
incumbents would expect to get
some advice from their predecessors,
but the office of Prime Minister is not
"most other jobs". This meeting went
unpublicised until Sunday when
Labour leaked it for some good pub-
licity. It is a shame that it came out
this way, because the meeting was a
wholly sensible idea for someone
new to the job. Mr Blair has already
sought the advice of Paddy
Ashdown, and although he declined
John Major's offer of advice on how
to handle the IGC conference, he did
consult him on Northern Ireland.
Indeed, Mr Blair is going one step
further in inviting President Clinton
to address the Cabinet, the first for-
eign leader to do so.
So what are we to make of this?
Some people were not slow off the
mark with their opinions, notably
Denis Healey, who criticised Mr
Blair for seeking the advice of
Labour's greatest enemy for over a
decade, calling it "a bad choice" to
talk with a woman who had been a
"disaster" and had "destroyed British
influence in Europe". On Tuesday
The Guardian's quite charming car-
toonist compared Thatcher with
Reagan, Hider, Napolean, Genghis
Khan and what seemed to be
Hannibal Lecter, in an array of per-
sonalities Mr Blair was inviting in for
a chat. Quite apart from its usual
sledgehammer subtlety, The
Guardian is missing the point. Mr
Blair is not advocating Mrs
Thatcher's policies, but simply
recognising her immense political
experience on the world stage. Not
even her most ardent enemy can
doubt that she has amassed a wealth
of experience and contacts, and asso-
ciation with her will impress many
foreign leaders, especially those in
Asia, who particularly admire her.
During the meeting they discussed
a wide variety of issues, with a
spokesman saying "she has strong
views. She was opinionated and it
was stimulating ... he didn't find her
short of opinions." Her most conspic-
uous advice was "Choose your
ground carefully. Make up your mind
what is important. Don't fight on
ground on which you cannot win."
Mr Blair had decided on the meeting
because he liked her on a personal
level, and that she still is "a figure on
the world stage and knows many of
the leading players." It seems per-
fectly reasonable for the pair to dis-
cuss foreign affairs.
There are, of course, a number of
subjects on which Mrs Thatcher is
vehemently opposed to Labour's
plans: Europe springs instantly to
mind. But although it may be diffi-
cult for the Labour party to admit,
Mrs Thatcher was right about a num-
ber of issues long before anyone else
saw them. She had built up a close
relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev
during the 1980s, culminating in her
1987 trip to Moscow. She is widely
respected in Eastern Europe as one of
the first Western leaders to see the
importance of the reforms and demo-
cratic movement there during the
1980s.
Among the natural differences
between Thatcher and Blair, there are
certain similarities which Blair
would quite happily see confirmed.
Both used their time in opposition to
plan for Government: witness the
speed of reform in the first few
weeks of this Government if any of
you have any doubts. Both moulded
the party in their image, and both
have engendered a sense of trust in
the population, confirmed by their
comfortable mandates. I'm sure Mr
Blair would like to see Mrs
Thatcher's reputed understanding of
British interests abroad, strong lead-
ership, the youth vote and a firm
hand with her party, added to the list
of common attributes.
Blair is looking to be seen by his-
tory as a statesman rather than a
politician, much as Thatcher is
already seen today. He has the
advantage that his direct predecessor
never had: the chance to implement
fresh policies and break new ground
without U-turning on archaic policy.
Blair's policies have different roots
to those of his predecessors: Thatcher
pulled the centre of gravity of Britsh
politics so far to the right as to pre-
cipitate a wholesale change in the
Labour party, and ironically shatter
the Conservatives. Mr Blair is one of
Thatcher's children as much as any
of us.
Having made one slightly askew
election prediction this year, it was
reassuring to find that my psepho-
logical skills have not completely
deserted me.
The latest Presidential election
went absolutely to form, and I can't
say I'm surprised or disappointed.
Commiserations must, of course, go
to the defeated candidate, but the
flippancy of her campaign sealed her
fate a log time ago. Call me an old
cynic (everyone else has), but it had
CV bolstering written all over it. If
the list of names bandied around for
the third run are correct, I feel confi-
dent that we should have a satisfac-
tory outcome before Christmas.
The scarcity of talent this year
does raise an important question. If
we fail to elect someone in the next
ballot, is it time to move to a non-
sabbatical president? I can almost
hear the sharp intake of breath by the
hacks. Scrap a Sabb? Thin end of the
wedge! Next you'll be suggesting
cutting the Union Council to a sensi-
ble number. The problem seems to
be that too much has been dumped at
the door of the President, necessitat-
ing the full-time nature of the post.
Surely the role of the President is
akin to that a board chairman - chair
the key meetings, represent the
Union and help formulate policy.
The daily grind of paper work is
surely more
presidency on the grounds that they
could not afford to defer a job or

I unexpected
k n o c k - o n
benefit of
this could
well be to
open up the
position to a
wider body
of students,
as hinted at
in A Swift's
letter last
week.
While the
c h a r g e s
made against
Eric were
unfair, the
b r o a d e r
point about
the cliquey
nature of
ICU was
w e l l
the task of
the perma-
nent Union
staff and the
Deputy pres-
idents etc.
Before Piers
and Sarah
seek me out
with a meat
cleaver, I
would argue
that this is
where a sab-
batical post
would be
better placed.
They are, as I
well know,
not sitting
around with
their feet up,
and nor is
Eric (as for â€¢ f
the editor of voice of reason
this august
journal...).
Moving work from the President
to the DPs and their staff seems a
possible solution. In this way, peo-
ple would not be deterred from the
o b s e r v e d .
The ability to recite the Union
Constitution verbatim is not a strong
quality in a candidate. Indeed such a
slavish adulation of rules, regula-
tions and the sound of one's own
voice should ensure that such people
never make it past the Tiddly Wink
Soc Social Committee.'However, all
of the above may be of mere acade-
mic interest if some of the excellent
potential candidates throw their hats
into the ring. Cometh the hour,
cometh the man.
Couple of quick points before my
fingers seize up from all this typing.
Some of you who regularly visit
Luigi Malone's may have noticed a
change in their attitude towards
large groups at lunchtime, namely
the refusal to accept bookings for
more than ten. A shame indeed,
given their incomparable Santa Fe
chicken pizza.
Ever keen to bring you, dear read-
er, the highest level of service, may I
recommend The Rat & Parrot on
Gloucester Road, on the site of the
old Harrington public house. The
transformation is magnificent in
every sense, save for the fact that the
beer is still rather average. The food,
however, is superb. My suggestion
for that Friday long-lunch - Classic
Club sandwich at said establish-
ment, followed by a couple of quick
pints of divine summer ales at
Southside before closing time. SCR?
Who needs/wants it?
