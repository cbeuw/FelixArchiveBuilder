Feature Felix 909 25 July 1991
It was on a fresh spring morning in
mid September that the Prospector
Train sped me east from Perth. Ten
weeks of accumulated Aussie
souvenirs crammed into four large
pieces of luggage surrounded me
I sat on East Perth station,
sheltering from the mid morning
sun under the brim of my bush hat
and contemplated the next eight
days on the open railroad.
kilometre Nullarbor plain proper.
Opened on the 22nd October 1917,
the early supply trains which
supplied the navvies with every
necessity of life were nick-named
'Tea and Sugar Trains'.
Australia had beckoned three
months earlier with the offer of
employment as a geologist in the
iron ore mines of the Hamersley
Province 1,000km north of Perth.
I planned to cope with the tedium
of the terrain by writing a university
thesis to meet a deadline two weeks
after my return to England.
Once out of the Perth suburbs the
path of the Prospector pursued the
white water of the youthful Swan
River, dissecting dense deepfirtree
clad hill sides. Such Alpine-style
scenery seemed quite
unrepresentative of this largely
The Tea and Sugar
In 1988, the
Australian
bicentennary
year,
Christopher
Riley made a
coast to coast
rail trip across
southern
Australia
I planned to punctuate the four
thousand kilometre journey with a
stop-over in Kalgoorlie, a gold
mining town with roots as deep as
the origins of the gold bearing fluids
which once dissected the continent's
ancient terrains. Disembarking
from the Prospector here would
allow three days before the next
India-Pacific train which would
whisk me across the Great Victorian
Desert to the oldy-worldy oasis of
Adelaide and the next leg of the
journey.
It is a little over 2,700 km
between Perth in Western Australia
and Adelaide in South Australia,
almost the same as the distance
from London to Moscow. Most of
this distance is comprised of the
Nullarbor (meaning treeless) Plain.
Today's base maps of this
topographic vacuum show three
straight lines. The key denotes each
as; a road, a railroad and a
telegraph line.
The lonely Eyre Highway takes
its name from John Eyre, the trail-
blazer who made the first east-west
crossing in 1841. That journey took
five months and resulted in the
death of Eyre's companion John
Baxter. In 1877 the telegraph line
was laid along a route that the
highway was later to follow. Later
that century the prospectors bound
for the gold fields of WA followed
the telegraph line. In 1896 the first
bicycle crossing was made and in
1912 the first car was driven across.
Only three more cars managed the
trip in the next twelve years.
In 1941 the war inspired the'
building of a trans-continental
highway, which remained
unsurfaced until 1976. The highway
follows a southerly route close to
the sheer coastline and makes
today's Nullarbor crossing much
easier. Despite this, petrol stations
are up to 200km apart, and help
from other traffic scarce.
The Trans-Australian Railway
runs 150km north of the highway
and transects the 260,000 square
Finishing my contract two weeks
early I planned to use my new found
time to travel overland from Perth
to Sydney and my flight home. I
had ten days to complete the
3,961km and hoped for a better rate
of progress than John Eyre had
achieved 147 years before!
Everyone I spoke to about the
Nullarbor gave advice on how to
cope with the boredom and
monotony of the empty wastes.
'Count the 30 metre spaced
telegraph poles and work out the
speed of the train'. None had ever
desert state, and no indication of
things to come. A surface water
pipeline accompanies the train to
Kalgoorlie, the white streak
ducking and diving, swerving and
bobbing beside the moving train.
The intricate, green topography
created by the Swan River
disappeared to the south as we
inched our way into the barren gold
country. The water pipe persisted
to scurry along close by. Although
sparsely populated, this stretch of
track was positively teeming with
life compared with the desolation I
dared to make the journey by train
themselves. They preferred to take
the highway around the edges of the
hostile void, or to deny its vastness,
skipping over it by plane in a matter
of hours. For a 'Person of Mother
England' such as myself, it was the
only way to experience the alien
dimensions of this island continent.
was to experience once on the
Nullabor. The elderly gentleman
beside me had made the journey on
the India-Pacific train in the early
sixties. He assured me that nothing
had changed in twenty-five years.
It was easy to believe; there was
little that could have changed! Why
was he undertaking the monotony

of such a trip again? The Nullabor
plain is surely a place you only
attempt to cross overland once in a
lifetime. Had it really taken twenty-
five years to recover from his first
trip?
Six hundred kilometres and eight
hours later, without warning,
Kalgoorlie was suddenly upon me.
No suburbs or outskirts to herald its
arrival and only a skyline of mine
ain
shaft head gear to suggest its
purpose.
My three days in the gold country
ranged from a trip one thousand
metres underground with geologists
from the Mount Charlotte mine, to
a stroll down Hay Street, past rows
of bright red corregated cabins; the
prefabricated brothels of
Kalgoorlie's red light district.
The India-Pacific pulled out of
town at 6.00am, sixty hours after
the Prospector had arrived. The
bulging brown uniform of an
overweight conductor bustled
through the carriage welcoming us
to 'his' train and warning of the
consequences of wasting the
precious water. 'We all want the
toilets to still flush in Adelaide' he
joked.
The old mining town sunk into
the desert as abruptly as it had
emerged. My elderly friend from
the Prospector was in the same
carriage, still tyring to recall if
anything had changed. There was
now even less on which to gauge
any change, with only thirteen
settlements in the next 2,000km.
My immediate companions for the
next thirty hours were three
blondes, Dee, 4, Bo, 6, and their
mother Susan. Less than one hour
into the journey Bo could wait no
longer and challenged me to a game
of cardsâ€”'UNO'. It was sometime
since I'd last played, but I quickly
recalled the rules and managed not
to be beaten. The final score of
forty nil impressed only me and it
was several days later I realised that
perhaps I should have tried a little
harder to lose!
By the time we reached
Parkstone, Kalgoorlie's trees had
disappeared to be replaced by
saltbush, bluebush and dessicated
acacia trees. These gave way to
short brown grass which was finally
beaten into submission by the
scorched broken rock of the
limestone plateau. Humidity did not
exist. I could only marvel at the
courage and stupidity of John Eyre
and John Baxter for attempting such
a crossing alone on foot.
The Nullarbor is not an
undulating sand dune desert like
those of North Africa. It is rocky
and flat, inhabited only by
kangaroos, rabbits and the odd
camel. Even the Aborigines avoid
it, their reserves scattered round its
perimeter. The snooker table
topography rivalled the flatness of
the Cambridgeshire fens. The
deeply dissected dykes of the
fenland fields seemed Himalayan in
comparison.
Occasionally we sped through
small camps of waving men,
women and children, past in an
instant. They appeared to live for
each train and it seemed a crime not
to stop. All we could do was return
the wave.
The first stop came at 9.30am in
the withering metropolis of
Zanthus, a land of loners. At only
200km from Kalgoorlie we were
still within dirt road commuting
distance for shopping in the gold
town. We all spilled off the train
and onto the ground, one metre
below, awe struck by the
remoteness and the lack of buildings
which barely formed one street.
Our freedom was short lived and
ten minutes later we were torn away
from THE shop and herded back
onto the wagons.
Lunchtime didn't arrive soon
enough. Something new to do. I
shared a packet of biscuits with Bo
and Dee and returned to the thesis.
The next three hundred
kilometres bought two more
anonymous supply stops. The train
stuck out of each cluster of cabins
like an arrow through an apple. The
isolated agrophobia of each
habitation was hard to fully
comprehend. Such isolation bred
had begun.
Telegraph road came round twice
more before Dee, Bo and Susan
decided to turn in. The double seats
spun round full circle and the table
dismantled to be incorporated into
claustrophobia, the surrounding
hostility of the desert imprisoning
and confining each conurbation.
The day 'clickety-clacked' on and
the tedium of the train's limited
vocabulary started to wear. The
UNO, the thesis and conversation
had been superceded by the
walkman. 'Telegraph Road' started
playing and I resorted to counting
them, recalling the advice of my
well wishers. I calculated the train
was doing a demoralising 50mph.
I wished I hadn't bothered.
Both Western Australia and the
sun were rapidly disappearing. The
telegraph poles became silhouetted
against an eerie outback sunset, the
only trees in a treeless plain. We
inched into South Australia and a
black, blank night. My staring
reflection now dominated the
window and I was pleased to draw
the curtains, banishing it outside.
Time to eat again. I munched my
way through some more bread,
cheese and apples, pondering the
predictability of my provisions.
In the dark an hour later we
reached Cook, the halfway mark
and a major refuelling station. A
large marigold moon glowed low in
a blue-black canvas of sky and
desert, illuminating the floating
canopy of corregated roofs.
Three hours down the track I
suddenly felt a new sensation.
Everyone in the carriage had
adopted the synchronised swaying
so familiar to the London
Underground. We had just
negotiated a bend, the first since
lunch 498km ago! The longest
straight piece of railway track in the
world was past before I realised it
the 'bed'. Forgetting that deserts get
cold at night I hadn't bothered to
retrieve my sleeping bag. I regretted
this for the next eight hours as I lay
shivering on my cusion of biscuit
crumbs, covered only by a denim
jacket.
By 6.00am (4.30am W A time) I
could bear it no longer and rose to
use some of the precious water,
washing my hair in the compact
shower room. Suffering from
unbalanced travellers diet I was
thankful that the toilet still flushed!
The new day brought new
terrain. The Nullarbor had past with
the night and the damp morning air
and the abundance of trees were
most welcome. We clattered into
Port Augusta at 8.30am and stopped
for ten minutes to stretch our legs-.
With only 380km left we were now
travelling almost directly south. On
the right horizon were the fertile
Flinders Ranges; to the left the
dazzling reflectance of the Spencer
Gulf in the hot, bright 9.00am sun.
I finished my bread and fruit for
breakfast in the hope that we would
arrive by lunch time.
Adelaide bought mixed feelings;
relief of arrival yet sadness at the
disbanding of my travelling
companions. I was sorry to part
with Dee and Bo. The camaraderie
established in the carriage was
dismantled only too quickly as the
'expedition' members disembarked
to go their separate ways. The
satisfaction of enduring the
unpunctuated tedium of the 200km
'Tea and Sugar' run was unique.
For now though, the order of the
day was to 'do' Adelaide before my
train for Melbourne departed.
