25 July 1991 Felix 909 Feature
Not so very distant in time or space, there is a country weeping under the brutal terror of
a political party run by a human with no discernable character. The only thing known
about him is that he is a 'nice' man. Anna Teeman unearths this man's past in the hope of
finding something. Or indeed anything.
Mr John Major, the man who is
now the Prime Minister of Great
Britain, is also the man who failed
to become a bus conductor with
London Transport.
How did this happen, how did the
man rejected by London Transport
become the Prime Minister, or
rather how did the man who became
Prime Minister fail to become a bus
conductor?
Many years ago in the time of the
sixties, three people spent a nerve-
wracking day in the recruiting
office above Wandsworth garage
trying to become bus conductors.
There was a tall 17 year-old, a West
Indian Woman and a third mystery
figure. Each was given a ticket
machine to play with and an
arithmetic test. The West Indian
woman was the best of the bunch
and was so thrilled to get the job,
she danced.
The tall, lanky 17 year-old
walked away from Wandsworth
garage and wandered far and wide
to find himself, not long after in
front of the door with the figure 10
on it. So he thought 'Why not?',
straightened his tie, knocked on the
door and walked in.
The lanky lad, though his contact
was brief, was not forgotten. Many
years later his trials with the ticket
machine and arithmetic test were
fondly recalled. This whisper of
memory so long held grew louder
to a steady rumble until men and
women proclaimed from the
rooftops 'I've driven with a man,
who worked with a woman, who
sold a ticket to the man who taught
the woman who beat John
Major...to sell tickets!'.
John Major, hearing this cry,
even though the thick walls of
number 10 Downing Street, scuttled
up onto wnat was now his roof and
cried T was too tall, honestly!'.
This produced a roar of delight
from those who caught the drift of
his cry on the winds that blow to the
far off borough of Wandsworth.
Each and everyone turned to each
other and said 'That's funny, that's
really funny'—they laughed so
much they almost fell off the
rooftops—and one or two of them
actually did. 'But why this hilarity?'
asked a woman of a fallen reveller
in the street below.
'He failed the arithmetic test,
luv.'
'Oh goody' said the woman.
Mr. Major- man, minion or machine?
WHO IS
J O H N
MAJOR?
'Oh no' said John M .
'Impossible' said the polite man
from the buses, 'because he was the
Chancellor.'
'Exactly' said the cynic.
Then suddenly everyone stopped
and once again turned to one
another but this time said with one
voice 'I'm confused'. Then they
stood silent, looking exactly that.
All except a West Indian bus
conductress who danced more
gleefully than on the day she got her
first job.
In the almost perfect stillness one
quiet voice could be heard distant
yet clear. 'Show me the great book
where 'tis all writ down'. Then the
silence, no longer content with itself
became embarrassed.
'Ah hem', said an apologetic
voice.
'Not possible.'
We lost many of our records in
1980 when London Transport was
split up into smaller companies, and
thus began this tale of woe:
At the dawn of Eighties Age a
blue dragon roamed throughout the
land, the fearsome creature, known
to one and all as 'Mad Maggie the
Money Monster' breathed fire so
hot it was white tinged with blue.
The fire consumed all in its path,
even parching the water itself, and
only the scorched plain of
privatisation remained. From its
lair, deep in Whitehall Castle, the
Fire Monster satiated its thirst with
juicy red buses as they lingered
tantalisingly beyond the castle
gates. And the great book where it
is all writ down? Lost forever in the
blue fire from which only a tattered
phoenix rose, fragmented, yet
miraculously able to open wide its
wings if only to cough at its first
flap. The apologetic voice faltered
and became weepy.
The Fire Monster, deep in its
Dulwich lair, licked its lips—once
burning but now long cooled—and
let out a tiny puff of smoke, a
signal. Now the fledgling monster
peers through Whitehall windows
and over rooftops crammed with
watchful silent figures and glimpses
a single cloud, rising. The message
is ' A l l is safe, none will ever
know'. The new monster, now
miraculously mature, licks lips fast
warming.
'How convenient' it breathes and
steams up all the windows, then
turns its back and lights its fire.
