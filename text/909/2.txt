The scene is American suburbia
where freedom of expression is
shown by choosing which pastel
colour to paint your house. The
time is present irrelevant, but
something is very different. Within
view of this sickeningly idyllic
housing estate is an improbably
high 'Dracula' craggy mountain
with matching 'Dracula' craggy
castle (painted in a tasteful shade of
pastel black). Nobody in the pastel
houses seems to notice this
aberration in normality due to the
fact that this is no everyday story;
it is a fairy tale.
In the craggy castle lives a
c r e a t i o n , a m o d e r n - d a y
Frankenstein's monster; a half-
finished model of a man with a
leather body and scissors for his
fingers. H e is Edward (Johnny
Depp), a model of a man who is
human on the inside, but externally,
he is a parody of human form,
comic in his looks.
E d w a r d r e c e i v e s his first
experience of society, when he is
taken home and cleaned up by a
very motherly A v o n lady, Peg
(Dianne Wiest). The stereotypical
Americans are amused by him, and
accept him into their society, much
as they would a video recorder if
it landed on their doorstep. They are
proud of showing h i m off, letting
him cut their hair, clip their dogs
and hedges, but few actually get to
know him. Fame spreads and soon
he looks as if he may evenfitinto
society.
H e meets Peg's daughter, K i m
(Winona Ryder) and falls in love.
She on the other hand accepts him
as a person and figures out that he
is a far nicer guy than her current
boyfriend. O K , so she falls in love
too but doesn't know it. It happens
in films all the time.
Sounds simple, doesn't it? Life's
never like that. After several
m i s d e m e a n o u r s a n d
misunderstandings later he is being
shunned b y the g a g g l e o f
neighbours, and wanted by the
police. K i m suddenly realises that
she loves him after all and life in
general gets rather difficult for all
concerned.
Tim Burton's direction (Batman,
Beetlejuice) is superb. Keeping in
the same vein as Batman, Edward
Scissorhands is a 'large' film which
is d e s i g n e d for and w o r k s
excellendy on the big screen. Plenty
of wide panning shots and moody
lighting are present to keep film
buffs happy and set the atmosphere
of the film. T h e pacing of the film
is perfect, a very comic superficial
beginning and first half which
deepens and darkens as the film
progresses, ending in a moody and
serious ending.
John Depp gave an superlative
performance as Edward with firm
backing from the rest of the cast.
Winona Ryder was as competent as
her role would allow, but her
character was written as being far
too stereotypical to do anything
outstanding. Nevertheless her
acting would leave any gerbil
drooling over his whiskers.
W h a t more can I say? A
beautifully written, beautifully
acted, beautifully made,
wonderfully funny and deeply
moving film. A s I left the review
cinema I was choking back the
tears. Then again, I'm a gullible
romantic. Romance is contagious;
catch it.

In a week when my grasp of reality
was decribed as 'tenuous', it is
fitting that I should get around to
reviewing this album. Y'see, lunacy
is a well-worn trick used mainly by
avant-garde freaks, following long
bouts of going without sleep and
taking c o p i o u s amounts o f
recreational pharmaceuticals; result
being, they get lost in the virtually
limitless void of self-contemplation
and pretence.
A l a n V e g a , Stooge-inspired
electro rocker and half of Suicide,
does not fit in with the above
description. This particular freak is
unattractively twisted. S o
unattractive in fact, that his
appearance onstage has had the
tendency to spark off vicious,
horrific audience reactions (bottles,
spit and lit cigarettes are the most
common form of greeting for this
man). The nearest thing this man
has known to a normal move was
:
The film that reaches the parts other
films cannot reach—Robin Hood
has everything: humour, adventure,
romance, suspense, murder and any
other characteristic you'd like to
name. K e v i n Costner gives an all
too convincing performance of
Robin—once rich boy now poor
man.
Alan Rickman (the evil German
from Die Hard) makes a very
malicious Sheriff of Nottingham.

A l l this, p r e s u m a b l y , i s
provoking interest in the record,
because I haven't said anything
about it yet, and it was released last
year. 'Deuce Avenue' releases an
amphetamine-fuelled psychosis
( M . M . standard phrase No. 13); as
a portrait of V e g a , one could
imagine Elvis Presley as visualised
by Francis Bacon. A grotesque
rockabilly fiend slashing the facade
of c o n t r o l o v e r a r a z o r e d ,
monstrously m i n i m a l backing.
Where 'Body B o p Jive' is tense and
u n n e r v i n g , the title track is
unequivocally deranged. This is
about as close to the edge as is
possible - either that or we've both
gone o v e r k i l l . N . B . - to the
collective ' Y O U ' , ' Y O U ' won't
like it.

The star-studded cast includes Brian
Blessed, C h r i s Slater (Young
Guns), M a r y E l i z a b e t h
Mastrantonio (The Abyss) and a
famous unmentionable playing King
Richard (guesses on a postcard
please!). The scenery is amazing,
filmed on location in France and
England and succeeds in wrapping
you in the mystery surrounding the
legend of Robin of the Hood.
