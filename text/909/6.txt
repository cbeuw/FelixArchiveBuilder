Felix Changes
This newspaper has many good
points, but its name is not one of
them. There is the possibility that
Felix will change its name in the
near future. This will occur at
Christmas, if at all, along with a
rationalised design for its pages. We
have a design consultant in to help
us with our choice - at no cost to
the Union, College or ourselves. I
sincerely hope that the newspaper
that emerges is more professional
looking and easier on the eye. The
reasons for a change of name are
various - 'Felix' is not a name that
immediately conjures up an image
of a responsible and intelligent
newspaper, it is often confusing to
people from outside the college, it
is an old and somewhat jaded joke
based on the occasional college
magazine 'Phoenix', it is, in a
word, a puerile name.
There are good reasons for
keeping it - the main one being that
the name 'Felix' has a reputation in
the college. I hope more arguments
for and against will be debated in
the future -1 don't want this change
to be seen as the mad fantasy of a
megalomaniac editor, but because
there is a need to change.
Another possible modification
concerns the status of the Print Unit
in relation to Felix. Any attempt to
make this a retail outlet is fraught
with complications - mainly due to
the state of mental health of the
Editor and the independence of the
newspaper. I am not against any
such change, provided that the
primary concern of those involved
is the production of Felix. I would
fight tooth and claw against
anything I deem to be damaging to
the paper.
Credit where it's due
Having been rude to the denizens
of College Estates on more than one
occasion, I think I ought to correct
the balance by saying that the
painting of our office, under their
direction, is much appreciated and
will make the office look and feel
far better. I withhold final
judgement until the whole thing is
completed.
Universal Mysteries
When the primeval mammal
discovered the orange, it was a
sensible idea to use it again.
Likewise the tomato, the apple and
the strawberry. What I want to
know is why the primeval mammal
thought that cabbage was a good
idea. If the entirety of the Brassica
family were considered nothing but
recreational flatulence inducers
used as a socially cohesive herb by
an eccentric and esoteric south
American indian tribe, the world
would be just that little bit more
logical.

E d i t o r i a
Boring Mines
Dear FELIX,
I feel that I must write to you in
order to put the record straight after
your publication of Anna Teeman's
article British Coal Challenge Ban
in the Felix Summer Special. As a
recently graduated student of the
Mining Engineering course at
Imperial (whose fourth year major
project was an opencast coal site in
the heart of a suburban area), I feel
that I speak from a position of some
strength on this matter. A number
of points should, I feel, be made
about the article.
1. Far from being 'economic
stupidity', the operations run by the
Opencast Executive of British Coal
are some of the cheapest mines in
Europe, only being undercut in
price by, for example, the large
lignite mines in Germany.
2. 'In addition, low sulphur coal
must be imported into the country,
at cost, for proper mixing'. Much
of the coal produced by British Coal
Opencast is used as 'sweetener',
added to improve the quality of the
coal produced by the underground
mines so beloved of Ms Teeman.
3. The implication is made that
F.O.I.L. would appreciate the site
to be mined using underground
methods. Three points are raised
here:
a) Underground mining may
employ more men than .opencasting,
but is far more expensive than
opencast and can, in the shallow
deposits that would be considered
for opencasting, produce extreme
surface subsidence.
b) Longwall underground mining
is only applicable efficiently to
deposits with certain characteristics,
such as a large horizontal extent,
and a relatively continuous orebody
topography. The costs involved in
establishing such an operation are
considerable, and the production
costs under the wrong conditions
astronomical.
c) Having not long been granted
freedom from labour agreements
that meant that British Coal had to
maintain uneconomic production,
they would rather not open a pit of
any description than be forced into
producing coal at a loss.
4. 'The British Coal planning
application...contains only vague
assurances that no detrimental
environmental impact will result'.
No open cast mine in this country
will be given planning permission
without strict limits being placed on
noise, dust, blasting vibration,
visual impact and increased road
traffic, and can be shut down by
government inspectors if these are
not adhered to.
5. A l l coal sites, of whatever
design, produced quantities of dust.
While I cannot comment on
individual cases, it is certainly bad
practice to allow a site to shed
deleterious quantities of dust, and
this can be prevented by the use of
simple water bowsers to lay the
dust.
6. If two children were killed by
lorries from a site where all of the
coal was being moved by rail, I
would infer that these lorries were
involved in carrying supplies to the
site. Should the site be mined using
underground methods, the
quantities of supplies required
would be vastly increased, as these
sites require, inter alia, face and
roadway supports, ventilation
equipment and heavy items of plant
such as face shearers that are not
used in opencasting.
In all affluent countries, as wealth
increases, there is a decreased level
of understanding as to the source of
that wealth, and Ms Teeman seems
to be a prime example of this
Why has the Union ignored
postgraduates this year? As
members of the student body the
postgrads deserve more from the
Union.
To collect your ideas andfindout
how the Union can aid postgrads
and provide the events and help that
is needed there will be a series of
departmental-based meetings.
These will be held either in your
departments, providing easier
access, or in the Union Building to
observation. Employing more
people for the sake of increased
local employment, to the point
where economic realities are simply
ignored, is exactly the sort of
centrally planned communist
stupidity from which Eastern
Europe is struggling to free itself.
British Coal is an efficient, low cost
producer, and extracts coal under
stricter environmental controls than
almost any operator in the world.
Would Ms Teeman like to see the
entire, not inconsiderable,
workforce of British Coal Opencast
and its contractors forced out of
work, rather than letting some
people be quite close to a heavily
shielded hole in the ground for a
while?
Yours sincerely,
Dave Healy, M Eng.
show the facilities available.
Notifications will be posted in
your departments. We hope that
these meetings will enable us to
progress to larger inter-
departmental gatherings.
If you have any ideas regarding
the services you need from the
Union, then come to the meetings,
which will be advertised soon.
