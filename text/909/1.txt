Cure
For
All
Ills
The college governing body will
meet this week to examine IC's
student accommodation problem. A
possible solution to the problem is
entry into the government funded
Business Expansion Scheme or
BES. The scheme is a method by
which educational establishments
raise funds from the private sector
to buy student accommodation.
Individuals are allowed to invest
upto £40,000 with a tax free return
on their investment after five years.
Dividends would be solely derived
from rent paid by the students in
residence.
Imperial would not be the first to
enter such a scheme. The insurance
company 'SunLife' has set up
companies under the BES aegis at
Lancaster, Sussex and York
Universities, each of which now
hold funds of upto £5,000,000.
Despite the apparent advantages of
the scheme, there are considerable
problems in its implementation.
According to Malcolm Aldridge,
controller of IC's financial services,
one sticking point is that students
would have to be issued with
'assured shorthold tenancy'
agreements, which under the 1988
Housing Act give tenants rights that
are so extensive as to make them
difficult to dislodge at the end of the
student year.
Mr Aldridge said that there had
been no test cases evicting students
from college accommodation.
There is the possibility that students
would be tempted to stay in assured
tenancies instead of attempting to
find accommodation outside the
college.
HRH Princess Anne, the chancellor
of the University of London, visited
the college on the 10th July to open
the new centre for' Biomedical
systems and the centre for Toxic
Waste management. The Rector,
Sir Eric Ash, said that the new
centres were the 'physical
embodiment of the merger' of St
Mary's and IC.
The centre for Biomedical
systems was funded by the Sir Leon
F r e s h Start
Bagrit foundation and will be named
after him. Lady Stella Bagrit, his
widow, explained that he was a
humanitarian with 'a passionate
interest in science', and that he
would have appreciated the help
given to future scientists.
Professor Bryan Coles, former
Pro-Rector of IC, told Felix that
both centres will be starting MSc
courses in September.
Imperial's Careers Advisory
Service (CAS) has a new director.
John Simpson, formerly a
recruitment manager for ICI,
officially takes up his post on 1st
August. He takes over from Russ
Clarke whose services were
withdrawn when the college
decided to leave the University of
London CAS.
Ben Turner, future ex-Deputy
President of the Union said that he
was 'very confident in his (Mr
Simpson's) abilities'.

The Department for Education and
Science, the DES, has issued
figures for the student loan rates for
the academic year 1991-1992.
For students living away from

living away from home it stands at
£2,845 and for students living at
home, £1,795 for the year.
The 'top up' loans level for the
past academic year, 1990-1991,
were £460 for a full year and £340
for a final year student living away
from home in London, and £330
and £240 respectively for a student
living at home.
In addition the DES has released
figures concerning postgraduate
award rates. Bursaries for London
postgraduates will be £2950, or
£1760 if living in the parental
home. Studentships will be £4970
in London and £2915 for those still
at home.
