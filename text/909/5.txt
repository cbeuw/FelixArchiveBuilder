Kerapan Sapi
Matadors in
Indonesia, by
David Record
F o r as long as anyone can
remember men have always tested
themselves against bulls; the ancient
Spartans would vault over their
horns in a brazen display of
athleticism, Spanish matadors first
test their reflexes and later the
sharpness of their swords and the
youth of Pamplona prove their
manhood by fleeing i n the bull's
wake.
In Indonesia inter-village disputes
were often settled by a fight to the
death by bulls, but on the island of
Madura to the north of Java i n a
scene more reminiscent of ancient
Rome, teams of bulls race side by
side; this is Kerapan Sapi.
Tradition has it that bull racing
was encouraged by an early
M a d u r e s e m o n a r c h , K i n g
Panembahan Tomolo. Pairs of bulls
pulling a plough would race other
pairs across the dry and infertile
fields.
Today the bulls race in a specially
prepared arena and more than just
honour is at stake; for the victor is
a promised fortune in stud fees, a
lucrative prize anywhere in the
world.
The finest bullocks, with well
documented pedigrees, are reared
solely for racing. They are fed a
special diet of hay with supplements
of extra honey, eggs, beer and
secret herbs. Richer owners may
employ a trainer but usually a

farmer will train his own bulls.
Racing takes place in the dry
season beginning in April with
small village qualifying heats,
through divisional finals ending
every year i n Pamekasan, the
capital, with the Grand Final
usually held in late September.
Racing is the highlight of the village
year and the stadium begins to fill
hours before racing is due to
commence. B y m i d morning the
stadium is nearly full, children run
I am looking at the level of support
and structure provided by the Union
for postgraduate students (PGs) at
Imperial.
Members of Imperial College
Union (ICU) elect a PostGraduate
Affairs Officer ( P G A O ) who
represents P G s o n several
committees i n c l u d i n g U n i o n
Council, Union Academic Affairs
C o m m i t t e e and the C o l l e g e
Graduate Studies Committee.
The P G A O also chairs the
Postgraduate Group Committee,
which is a meeting representing
registered PGs (research assistants,
PhD and Msc students). The brief

containing iced drinks o f the most

Indonesia.
The entertainment begins with a
parade of the bulls, shaded by
parasols and bedecked in gilded
yokes. Accoutered with gold tipped
horns and other colourful regalia

of this group is to represent
postgraduates at all levels within the
college, to provide social activities
for postgraduates in college and
finance f o r departmental
postgraduate groups.
Last year there was no meeting of
this group and hence none of the
above aims were met. A t present
there is no P G A O and without this
post filled there c a n be no
Postgraduate Group Committee.
The loss of opportunity for the PGs
at IC includes the reduction of inter-
departmental communication on a
student level, the overlooking or
ignoring of P G problems and the
around the stadium. The larger
studs accompany their champions
with a band o f cymbalists, pipers,
drummers and gong players, their
melodic music adding to an already
tense atmosphere. Before racing
commences the finery is stripped
off, the tempo stepped up and the
pairs of bulls goaded into anger by
whips and branches. The jockey,
small even by Indonesian standards,
is lifted onto the sled which hangs
between the pair. H e sits in a near
trance, in each hand a small wooden
block with nails, a very primitive
steering wheel when one considers
that the next 150m w i l l be covered
far faster than a chemically assisted
Ben Johnson ever could.
A hush descends upon the crowd,
the music reaches a higher fever
pitch and the trainers strain to hold
back their bulls. A hefty slug of
arak, the infamous rice brandy, is
administered to the bulls, and they
are ready.
The flag drops and the crowd
roars. Muscles rippling, the bulls
surge down the track, the jockey
bobbing up and down alarmingly as
he desperately tries to keep a
straight path. Within seconds it is
all over, 30m past the line is a wall
and the jockeys frantically reign in
their pairs which veer left and right
into the seething crowd. They duck
and run to avoid the bulls, yelling
with joy as the pairs hurtle into their
midst. This dicing with death is as
much a part of the fun as the racing
and no one ever seemed to get hurt.
A s the cheers subside and the
victor and vanquished depart the
police good naturedly clear the
crowd from the finish. One hundred
and fifty metres away a new race
lines up. In the grandstand the more
restrained owners shake hands.
T r i u m p h a n t , expectant o r
seemingly indifferent, there is
always next year.
very few specific postgraduate
social activities organised outside
research groups.
The group also acts as a general
information d i s t r i b u t i o n a n d
collection network similar to the
academic affairs network set-up for
undergraduates already in existence
at I.C.
I am very interested in developing
the current I C U facilities offered to
PGs, but without a P G A O and the
support of committees described
above the job could be impossible.
