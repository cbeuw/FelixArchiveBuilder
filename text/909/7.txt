Felicitations
The Felix ' V competition, as in the
summer issue (908), has been won
by Saffron Owen-Jones of the
Materials Department. The lucky
winner can collect the prize from
the Felix office anytime - please

Romania
Two weeks ago a group of
volunteers left for Romania bearing
gifts in the form of toys and clothes
for Romanian orphans. Martin
Heighway, of the Royal College of
Science Union (RCSU) and about
25 others hope to join them on 30th
August.
The primary aim of the mission
is to provide 'people support' rather
than goods. This is due to problems
previous teams have suffered;
goods often being confiscated at the
border or being stolen and sold on
ineffective in its attempts to quell
public disquiet about opencasting.
A wave of protest against similar
proposals has swept through
communities nationwide; many
with long histories of deep and
shallow mining.
Opencast work started in Britain
during the Second World War when
to question the extraction of a then
vital energy resource would have
been tantamount to treason. In the
Green Nineties things are rather
different. It is no peasant army

The 'Midsummer event', organised
by the HUB office, proved a great

The plight of the Romanian
people has been over-shadowed by
the recent tragedies in the Middle

so remunerative deep mine sector.
However, according to Andrew
Cox, an independent energy expert,
extraction of Britain's near surface
coal does not make economic sense
due to its high sulphur content.
Opencast coal's primary destination
is the coal fired power stations of
the newly privatised energy
companies. The companies are
committed, by European edict, to
reducing sulphur dioxide emissions
and must set-off burning high
sulphur with low sulphur coal. Such
coal is scarce in Britain and its
forced import, says Mr Cox, has
contributed to the current trade
deficit.

power companies, due to expire in

Advisor, will be leaving her post on
30th September to take up an MSc

In common with many other
communities similarly threatened,
it is the loss of their countryside that
concerns protestors in
Leicestershire the most. During the
proposed eight year working period
a vast acreage of land would be
swallowed by the extraction
process.
Communities who have been
involved with British Coal for a
long time have little faith in either
its ability or commitment to keep
pollution levels down. Residents
living next to a current site in
Leicestershire, but a stone's throw
from the proposed site, suffered
dramatic increases in both noise and
dust when mining started. In the
words of a local market gardener,
activity within vacuums, won the
admiration of the judges for tackling
'one of the more opaque hard
sciences.' He receives £100 and a
year's subscription to 'New
Scientist' and 'Nature'.

who lost an entire crop to one
night's dustfall: 'We just want to be
left alone'. Following Ray Proctor's
assertion that 'We can extend
anything indefinitely', assurances of
speedy reclamation ring hollow.
Opencasting is no longer
welcome in Britain's mining
communities. Deep mines
employing whole villages have been
replaced by shallow pits employing
few local people. The closure of
deep mines was followed by a
desperate drive to attract new
industry of long term benefit to
mining areas. The environmental
impact of opencast sites, argue
protestors, actively discourages
such investment. Objectors in
Leicestershire claim that the
prospect of continued opencast
activity has already dampened
interest in the area and precipitated
a fall in house prices.
Left in limbo by British Coal's
plan, residents are impatient for the
August appeal. They are also
painfully aware that, under current
guidelines, ministers have allowed
opencasting on almost sixty percent
of the land on which local
authorities initially refused
permission.
The privatisation of British Coal
would lie high on the agenda of a
future Conservative administration;
opencsting is British Coal's most
profitable activity. Pressure groups
fear that even if the appeal is turned
down the project might still be
given the governmental green light
and the environment would be
sacrificed for short-term, short-
sighted financial gain.
Michael Heseltine might soon find
himself in the eye of a storm now
brewing in Leicestershire. British
Coal is battling fierce local
opposition against plans for a new
opencast coal mine. The final
showdown is set for August when
an independent inspector will hear
an appeal following the proposal's
rejection at local level.
The inspector is not empowered
to make a final ruling but to send
a recommendation to the
Environment Minister, Michael
Heseltine, with whom the final
decision rests. M r Heseltine is
under no obligation to comply with
the appeal's findings.
with government guidelines on
mineral extraction. The guidelines
state: 'because opencast coal mining
is one of the cheapest forms of
energy available to this country it
is in the national interest to
maximise production where that can
be done in an environmentally
acceptable way'.
In today's climate of changing
energy demands the true worth of
opencast coal is no longer so
certain. Protestors in Leicestershire
hope to scuttle mining proposals
with a dual economic and
environment broadside.

1993, are 'protectionist', say
protestors, because they prevent
companies from buying coal on the
international market. Ray Proctor,
chairman of British Coal's opencast
wing, says he is 'confident of
retaining a considerable proportion
of the contracts'. Pressure groups
remain unconvinced.
In the light of such damning
economic evidence, claim
objectors, the environmental
damage wrought by opencast
mining appears indefensible. The
impact of an opencast site is
threefold: loss of the countryside,
pollution from the working mine
and reclamation of the land
