Bring Cyprus to London
Sophia Goldberg on her first taste of Cyprus
ast Thursday we, the Food
Editors, decided to paint
the town red! We hit the
“Cyrus Hospitality” event,
organised by the Imperial
College London Cypriot society.
Yiango invited us along and, being
food lovers, it was a great excuse for
Carol and I to try something new.
Being students we obviously took up
her oﬀer as the entrance was free and
it was open to everyone.
The guests had an opportunity
to try traditional Cypriot sweets
like loukoumia (Cyprus delights),
siousioukos (a dessert made from

How to make halouvas
Did you miss the Cyprus event?
Don’t cry - here’s my family’s recipe
for halouvas, a super easy and ri-
diculously cheap traditional Cyprus
dessert. Make it and your house
will smell like Cyprus!
Ingredients:
1 cup coarse or fine semolina
1⁄2 cup blanched almonds
2 tbsp sunflower oil
1⁄2 cup sugar
2.5 cups water
1 tbsp rosewater or vanilla extract
Method:
In a small pan put the water and
sugar on medium heat. In a sepa-
rate pan put the sunflower oil and
almonds on medium heat and stir
until the almonds turn slightly
brown. Then add the semolina and
stir. When the sugar is dissolved
in the water add the rosewater or
vanilla, stir and then slowly pour it
in the pan with the semolina. Stir
as fast as you can so that no lumps
are created and continue until the
mixture becomes thick and you
can see the bottom of the pan when
stirring. Then put in individual
bowls or plates and decorate with
almonds.
There is so much pitta!

Make sure you book ﬁrst for this re-
staruant. The menu mainly contains
Cypriot food with a few international
inﬂuences.
grape juice and stuﬀed with nuts) and
halouvas (asemolina and rosewater
dessert). There was also pitta bread,
fried halloumi (Cyprus cheese), tara-
mosalata and black olives.
I’m not going to lie to you, the bev-
erages were not for the faint hearted.
The drinks on oﬀer were zivania and
commandaria, and they were very
popoular. They were deceptively
sweet – masking the large alcohol
content.
We loved it, so why not cook some-
thing inpsired by Cyprus in your
kitchen? Or head out to somewhere
where they’ll cook it for you?
Q. What did the cheese say when it
looked in the mirror?
A. Halloumi!
