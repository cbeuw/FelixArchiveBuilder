FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER
Reclaim the Night
Kirstin Hay invites you to join IC’s Feminist Society at the protest
a l k i n g
h o m e
at night
should not
be scary.
We live in a strange society. If fear
of our neighbours is considered
normal, but many people are. Many
women I know are afraid to walk
alone in the dark, due to a perceived
high danger of facing violence.
This is not a wholly surprising
state of affairs when adverts every-
where remind women to drink re-
sponsibly and to take care to avoid
danger, and when we live in a coun-
try where 1 in 4 women are raped
in their lifetimes. I know too many
people who have been raped, and
those are just the ones that have
told me about it.
The NUS (National Union of
Students) performed a study of
students and their experiences of
sexual assault and violence – 7% of
students experienced serious sexual
assault at university, and more than
25% had been sexually assaulted at
university.
It was perhaps the other findings
of the survey that were more shock-
ing, the vast majority of perpetra-
tors of violence against women
were known to their victim, and the
acts of violence happened in their
own homes.
Only 10% of the serious sexual as-
saults were reported to the police,
which is the same reporting rate
from any sector of society, and this
doesn’t even begin to take into ac-
count how many of these reports
become convictions. 43% of the vic-
tims of serious sexual assault in the
NUS study had never told anyone
about their experience.
The lack of reporting is attributed
to a feeling of shame, and fear of be-
ing told that it is their fault. To be
clear – rape is the fault of the rapist,
not the victim.
Whatever the victim was wearing,
or their sexual history, the blame
should never be attributed to them.
The study from the NUS also
looked at the wider culture that stu-
dents live in.
Nearly 70% of their respondents
reported that they had received
unwanted sexual attention at uni-
versity from catcalling and inap-
propriate questions about sexuality
and relationships, to more serious
sexual violence.
Overwhelmingly (though not
exclusively) the victims of sexual
violence are women, and the perpe-
trators are men. It is often easy to
say that women should take care to
avoid being raped, because women
get raped. It is perhaps more per-
tinent to tell men that some men
rape, and that they should take ac-
tion to stop this happening.
One action that comes from this
dire state of affairs is the Reclaim the
Night movement. Women standing
together to re-assert their right to
walk safely at night and their right
not to be subjected to violence or to
be blamed for any that is perpetrat-
ed against them. Reclaim the Night
is a night-time march that happens
every year in London and in other
cities across the UK and the world,
where thousands of women come
together and shout in opposition to
violence against women.
Joining a demonstration is a very
powerful action – it might not
change a law, or wave a magic wand,
but standing up for what you believe
in has a positive effect. Thousands
of women marching past a group
of people out in central London on
a Saturday evening chanting, “yes
means yes, and no means no”, has
the potential to make them remem-
ber about consent or consider the
consequences of their actions.
All of this may be a too idealistic
view of the positive effects of join-
ing a march such as Reclaim the
Night, but not to forget the impact
on those taking part – it is some-
what empowering to know that sex-
ual violence is not the victim’s fault,
and that there are so many others
with you standing up for your right
to be safe from rape and other vio-
lence.
The culture of rape in the UK can-
not be ignored, and protests, such
as Reclaim the Night, are one way
to make sure the problem is not for-
gotten.
If you wish to join the march with
others from Imperial, meet on Em-
bankment Place (near Embankment
underground) at 6pm on Saturday
24th November.
