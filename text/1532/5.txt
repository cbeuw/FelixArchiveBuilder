FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER
Middle East protest in Kensington
Last Thursday, High Street Kensing-
ton found itself overwhelmed with
protestors. At 5:30pm, crowds gath-
ered to protest against the violence in
the Middle East.
Imperial students were amongst
these protestors, campaigning with
members of the public. Protestors
could be found carrying signs, chant-
ing and making speeches in front of
the Israeli Embassy on High Street
Kensington.
The main advertising for the pro-
tests was done through Facebook,
with events created to include the pre-
planned details of the protest. Other
students were told by word of mouth
last minute and still decided to go.
Around 800 people turned up for the
protests, ranging from young Imperial
students through to elderly members
of the public. Tony Blair’s sister-in-law
Laura Booth had also been spotted at
the protest.
The demonstration featured both
pro-Israelis protestors and pro-Pales-
tine protestors. There were Imperial
students protesting for each side.
Imperial students have described
their accounts of the protests, men-
tioning that the closeness of the pro-
test made it easy for them to join in.
Some students were said to be using
megaphones or microphones with
speakers to spur the crowds on. One
account describes students climbing
onto a bus with a ﬂag whilst the bus
drove down the road.
One Imperial student stated that the
student voice can be the most power-
ful of them all and that it is important
for today’s generation to get involved
and get their voices heard.
The protests were said to last till
9pm, with some students staying on
afterwards to help clear up the mess.
The police had placed barriers on
the street so that cars could pass
through but High Street Kensington
was partially closed and the road to-
wards the Israeli Embassy had been
closed oﬀ. As more and more people
arrived, the police were forced to put
up more barriers.
In recent weeks, the unrest in the
Middle East has caused a great stir in
the media. Activists have accused me-
dia outlets of being biased and one-
sided. Articles published have been
deemed unreliable as sources about
the events in Israel and Palestine.
The on-going conﬂict has been a
source of debate for many years. The
most recent attacks were said to have
started at the end of October. Reports
have been made of continual attacks
from both sides resulting in numerous
casualties from both Israel and Pales-
tine.
The violence in the Middle East is
to such an extent that people felt the
need to demonstrate their disapproval
of the situation. Many were there sim-
ply to call and end to the death and
destruction.
There are more protests planned
during the next week with many Im-
perial students enthusiastic to take
part.

As I passed by the protests on
Thursday on my way home from
university, I was struck by the
sheer nature of hatred com-
ing from the anti-Israel protest.
They were waving flags of the
terrorist organisations of Hamas
and Hezbollah and their chants
were not against the recent
conflict but were calling for the
downfall and end of the State of
Israel. The Israeli counter-pro-
test however, were only shouting
slogans of peace. – Anonymous
passer-by
We wish this violent exchange to
find a rapid decline. Few know
this, but there is never actual
true peace in Israel/Palestine,
there are only moments of si-
lence. I think both sides would
rather return to this than suf-
fer from conflict. Israeli Society
does not persuades any political
agenda. – Israeli Society
While visiting the pro-Palasti-
niens protest I could not ignore
the call “From the river to the
sea Palestine will be free” that
was constantly repeated. As an
Israeli that grew up in the region
I know that the river they were
referring to is the Jordan river
boarding Israel and Jordan and
the sea is the Mediterranean Sea
on the west of Israel and Gaza.
In other words, the whole area
that is now both Israel and Pal-
estine. This saying is problematic
since it is deliberately asking for
a Palestinian country in all of the
territory while ignoring the right
for an Israeli country to exist
there as well. I want to believe
that the protesters understand
that the only solution to this long
conflict is having a Palestinian
country existing peacefully next
to an Israeli one, and I want to
hope that all of the thousands of
local British supporters didn’t re-
ally understand what they were
calling for by saying those words

Pro-Israeli statments
Firstly the majority of the news arti-
cles in Western media outlets often
present a one-sided, biased narra-
tive, of the Israelis defending them-
selves from Hamas and Palestinian
aggressors, resulting in a distorted
view of the Palestinians as aggres-
sors and the Israelis as defenders.
One often-quoted statement by
Malcom X reflects this situation
quite well...
“If you’re not careful, the newspa-
pers will have you hating the people
who are being oppressed, and lov-
ing the people who are doing the
oppressing.”
Over time, people seem to have
forgotten and cannot differenti-
ate from the oppressor and the
oppressed, and from the occupier
and the occupied. Gaza has been
under blockade now for numerous
years. The Palestinians have been
occupiedfordecades.Whenwillthe
world recognize their right to resist
and defend themselves.

demonstrates that Israel initiated
this current escalation, bringing into
question their true motives. – Pales-

I’vegrownuplivingthePalestinian
crisis. Watching it everyday on the
news, hearing about it constantly,
but it doesn’t make it any less heart-
breaking every time there’s a new
attack. What hurts more is that this
has become the norm.
We try and do what we can by
small gestures like updating our
statuses about Palestine, but this is
nothing.

For a protest that happened with
such short notice, I find that it went
quitewell.Thecrowdwasnotasbig
as we would have liked it to be but
the protest on Saturday compen-
sated for that. My favourite part
would definitely be the Rabbis who
came out to support Palestine and
the Palestinian people’s fight for
justice and the right to return to our
homes. I would like to thank every-

Pro-Palestinian Statements
• Students from
Imperial get in-
volved with pro-
tests against the
violence in the

• Protests blocks

that massacres like those in Gaza
and in Palestine as a whole STOP! –

It is baffling that the International
Community (including in both the
western and Arab countries) is not
doing more to stop the never-end-
ing violence in Palestine.
I simply hope that people look at
the situation objectively and shape
your opinion based on facts, not bi-
ased news articles.
I hope that this quote can shed
some light on the situation in Pal-
estine that has been on-going for
many years, not just the last few
days:
“The present Israeli government
ruthlessly and cynically exploits
the continuing guilt from gentiles
over the slaughter of Jews in the
Holocaust as justification for their
murder of Palestinians. The implica-
tion is that Jewish lives are precious,
but the lives of Palestinians do not
count.” Sir Gerald Kaufman, British
Jewish Labour MP, 2009, speaking
in a Commons debate. – A Muslim

ade or more. I remember having
to run into a shelter to hide from
the day and night rocket attacks
on Israel from the Gaza strip.
I remember that summer day
when there were two simultane-
ous suicide bombings in two dif-
ferent buses in the city of Beer-
Sheva, which took the lives of 16
Israelis and injured more than
100 others.
Concerning the current con-
flict in our region, I speak with
my parents daily on Skype and
I can’t express all sadness and
sorrow I feel, when my mum can
scarcely hold back tears when
she tells me about non-stop si-
rens, sleepless nights, terrified
young and old on the streets and
explosions of rockets.
I am saddened when innocent
people die on both sides. I hate
it that sirens and shelters are
the only reality that my 12 year
old nephew is familiar with and
that my home is under constant
threat. I wish more than ever,
more than anything else that this
conflict will come to an end. –
