Return of the Classics
Maciej Matuszewski talks about his favourite classic literature
espite of, or perhaps be-
cause of, classics being
so heavily emphasised
in secondary education
and being beloved of
critics they are certainly not the most
liked of books of ordinary people.
They are often considered dry, irrel-
evant or just plain boring.
Some of my favourite books, howev-
er, are classics and I believe that they
are just as vibrant, interesting and
powerful as the latest releases. While
they may seem old fashioned, believe
me, there is a reason why they have
stood the test of time. Here I present
just a few of these books – give them
a read and I promise that you won’t be
disappointed.
Ann Veronica
H.G. Wells
One of Wells’ less known novels this
is, on the face of it, a love story be-
tween the rebellious Ann Veronica
and her university lecturer, Capes.
While the romance plot is in itself en-
gaging the main attraction of the novel
is the compelling picture it paints of
the diﬃculties of life as a woman in
the early twentieth century – with a
focus on the suﬀragette and suﬀragist
movements.
While not a particularly major part
of the novel, Ann Veronica might be
of particular interest to Felix readers
since the eponymous protagonist is a
student at Imperial College.
Dracula
Bram Stoker
Probably the most famous vampire
novel ever, Dracula requires no in-
troduction or synopsis. On one level
a simple and satisfying story of the
ﬁght between good and evil, it is also
a masterful exploration of temptation
and primal desires. The story is told in
the form of diary entries, newspaper
articles and letters – giving the book a
unique feel and presenting the action
from many diﬀerent points of view.
Sherlock Holmes
Arthur Conan Doyle
Doyle’s 56 short stories and 4 nov-
els may not be of the highest literary
quality but the accounts of Holmes’
cases always provide a fun read.
Crime and Punishment
Fyodor Dostoyevsky
While at some times it may be fairly
slow Crime and Punishment remains
a powerful exploration of guilt and re-
demption. It does require some eﬀort
to get into but it is, ultimately, a very
rewarding read.
Huckleberry Finn
Mark Twain
Often called “the great American nov-
el” the book is surprisingly engaging
and readable. Following the epony-
mous character as he escapes from
home it paints a striking picture of the
southern United States.
Great Expectations
Charles Dickens
An archetypical Dickens novel follow-
ing the rise and decline of the fortunes
of young Philip Pirrip, usually referred
to simply as Pip. Both a brilliant char-
acter piece as well as an insightful
exploration of life in early nineteenth
century Britain.
Quo Vadis
Henryk Sienkiewicz
The most famous novel written by
Sienkiewicz. Following the struggles
of Christians in the early Roman em-
pire, many translations are available
and it was made into a major Holly-
wood ﬁlm in the 50s.
Faraon
Bolesław Prus
Probably the most obscure novel on
this list, but also, I believe, the best.
Prus has long been one of my favour-
ite authors – Joseph Conrad quite ac-
curately described him as being “bet-
ter than Dickens”.
Available in English translation un-
der the titles Pharaoh and The Pharaoh
and the Priest the book charts the fall
of Egypt’s New Kingdom through the
eyes of the ﬁctional Pharaoh Ramesses
XIII. While perhaps not entirely accu-
rate the depiction of Ancient Egypt
is brilliantly vivid and engaging. Prus
paints a detailed picture of how the
country is run – making it both relat-
able as well as wonderfully exotic.
The overarching plot obviously
draws elements from the eighteenth
century collapse of the Polish-Lithua-
nian Commonwealth but can also be
seen as representing and analysing the
decline and fall of old and decadent
empires in general.
The other strand of the novel is the
personal story of Ramesses XIII. He
is an eminently likeable character –
starting out brash and immature but
being forced to grow and develop
as a result of his increasing respon-
sibilities. He eventually becomes a
wise ruler with plans to reform and
strengthen Egypt, which are tragically
prevented by circumstances beyond
his control. Prus is a master of tragedy
and this novel’s ending is unmatched
in poignancy.
