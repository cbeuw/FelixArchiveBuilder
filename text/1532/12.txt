Imperial Kitesurf: Zero2Hero
n the weekend of the
27th October, Imperial
Kitesurf hit the Student
Kitesuﬁng (SKA) Zero-
2Hero weekend to teach
our beginners how to kitesurf.
But apparently some of you fools
have been living in a cave, with your
eyes closed and your ﬁngers in your
ears, because you don’t know what
kitesurﬁng is. The wiki has this to
say: kitesurﬁng or kiteboarding is an
adventure surface water sport that
has been described as combining
wakeboarding, windsurﬁng, surﬁng,
paragliding, and gymnastics into one
extreme sport. Essentially you harness
yourself to a giant sail and bounce
across the surface of the water doing
crazy tricks.
Right, now that’s ﬁnished, I can tell
you guys about the sick weekend we
had. The event was in Wales. Now
some of you might not have been
to Wales, but essentially it’s like go-
ing back in time. Your phone gets
no reception, GPS doesn’t work and
everything’s cold. The sort of cold
your grandfather boasts about. But
I digress. So we arrived on the Fri-
day evening to register and for a few
chilled beers. After some socialising
we hit the hay for an 8am start on Sat-
urday.
Saturday comes and we eat our ba-
con sarnies and head for the beach
at 9am. The parties already rocking
and the Beach Party Live guys already
have their custom ﬁtted Land Rover
Defender blasting out solid tune af-
ter solid tune from their hench sound
system. A little bit of health and safety
later (because concussion is all too
easy in this sport) ﬁnds us down on
the beach and cracking out the kites.
The beginners immediately went oﬀ
and started learning the basics of ﬂy-
ing a kite.
For the pros it was time to hit the
water. Crushingly the wind was oﬀ-
cross. Given no one wants to be blown
out to sea few went into the water that
day. For the rest of us we had no resort
but to kiteboard around the beach and
play ‘super sporty board sports and
water sports sports day’ in between.
Volleyball and beers anyone? At one
point the police showed up, but our
party was so rocking they asked us to
turn it up. But that’s just kite life.
Later on that night saw some awe-
some party. The sound system from
the Land Rover was now in the com-
munal hall and the Halloween decora-
tions were out. Given this event was
cross uni, the ratios were excellent,
and with the octobong (5 gallon, 8 way
funnel) at hand to ensure drunkenness
everyone was getting friendly. There
were heros. There were casualties. But
that’s just kite life.
The Sunday session started an hour
later (thank fuck) and found us on the
beach with little memory of the night
before, massive hang overs and a jig-
saw puzzle of photos. Given no one
really seemed to know entirely what
happened we decided it best to move
on and the beginners got back to work
mastering their kite work.
Thankfully the wind had switched
on-cross and us pros got into the
water. Nothing cures a hangover like
jumping into the ocean. Especially
when that jump is 3-5m into the air
and back again, but that’s just kite life.
All in all an excellent weekend. You
all missed out. UNACCEPTABLE. Be
sure not to miss our next beginners
weekend (23-25 November) check us
out on Facebook for more details or
email kitesurf@ic.ac.uk for details.
The beginners’ weekend, as reported by Leon Vanstone
You don’t get girls bruv.
Kitesurfing gets girls
Yep, the octobong should be the
focus. More importantly, why
has that guy from the front
just beamed in from the 60s?
Apparently it wasn’t
a nude beach. No
wonder people
looked at me funnily
when I went there
A typical British
day. So bright and
sunny
