Sexism is everywhere: it’s about time we grew up and realised this
Angry Geek
Sexism and science
am a white male, born in the
UK, and therefore I know
as much about being op-
pressed, excluded or preju-
diced against as David Cam-
eron knows about struggling to make
rent. There are, though, some things I
feel I can say about sexism at Imperial,
particularly in light of some recent Fe-
lix Comment articles.
The idea proposed last week by Ms.
Skett that whining, complaining or
being oﬀended is weak and plays into
the hands of a sexist culture, is prob-
lematic. Women are people. That’s the
general idea here, right? And people,
as we all know, are a mixed bunch.
Some are fairly extroverted and self-
conﬁdent, while other people are shy
and ﬁnd it hard to stand their ground.
We come up with ideas like human
rights, or equality acts, not simply
because there are rotten cultures out
there. It’s because they help defend
the very large proportion of any popu-
lation who aren’t good at defending
themselves. Not everyone can stand
and ﬁght in the face of this sort of
treatment. I know I couldn’t. The pres-
ence of a feminist society is encourag-
ing, not least because it makes it clear
that the problem exists and that there
are people who perhaps can be sought
out if students feel uncomfortable
bringing their issues anywhere else.
Imperial has a very real undercur-
rent of sexism running through it.
This operates both at the level of stu-
dents, where male-dominated depart-
ments often ostracise female students,
right through to the level of academics
and administrators.
There are studies that show that sci-
entists, the people who are stereotypi-
cally rational, will easily pick a student
who is male over a student who is
female, when shown identical appli-
cation forms. Even female scientists
demonstrate this tendency. Sexism is
a problem at any institution, then, but
particularly at Imperial which caters
to subjects where a serious imbalance
I
already exists before UCAS even get
involved.
The article went on to say that only
a minority are responsible for ‘true’
sexism, while the rest are just unfor-
tunately swept up in the culture, like
tiny prejudiced turds whirling around
a big sexist toilet. There’s a diﬀerence,
though, between unintentional sexism
from misconceptions, and 24% of male
students responding to Felix’s survey
agreeing that female students have
an advantage at Imperial. A quarter
of men said that. I am almost certain
that this logic is based on the idea that
female students are somehow masters
of seduction and enchantment, there-
by enabling them to succeed through
copying the work oﬀ helpless male
students, or getting preferential treat-
ment from equally helpless male staﬀ
members. Things like this are not just
warning signs that sexism and gender
imbalance is misunderstood by large
portions of the student population –
they are themselves acts of sexism.
A quarter of men think that women
couldn’t possibly be as good as they
seem to be, and must be getting some
kind of hidden advantage that men are
stopped from obtaining. This is ludi-
crous, and belittling, and the tiniest,
tiniest example of the problems Impe-
rial faces.
We are missing out. We are missing
out as a university, as a global popu-
lation of scientists and engineers, by
discouraging female applications,
dissuading women from staying with
science as a long-term career, and
producing an environment that is at
the very least uninviting, when it isn’t
being outright hostile. The problem
doesn’t start and end with Imperial, it’s
true. We don’t do enough as a society
to present science, technology or en-
gineering as equal-opportunity disci-
plines, right from the start of a child’s
life. But we can help push against this
problem from the top-down, by mak-
ing the ﬁnest institution of its kind in
the UK an example of equality. And it
all starts with admitting that we have
a problem.

Sir,
I can’t help but notice that since the
introduction of the new “Fuel” pie and
salad outlet, the number of pies which
contain meat has been gradually re-
ducing, up to the point where on some
days there are only cheese and mush-
room varieties. Now you can call me
old-fashioned, but who wants a pie
that just contains cheese? I recognise
that some people are vegetarian, but
serving up only these when the car-
nivorous majority would much prefer
a classic Steak and Ale.
Surely this must be some kind of cost-
cutting measure - the wholesale price
for a cheese pie must be lower than
that of one containing meat, yet both
of them are sold for the same price.
How about College stop paying some-
one to make sure we don’t take too
much mashed potato?

Any sexism in there?
Dear Sir,
I recently purchased a pasta salad
from the Library Cafe and noted the
extortionate price I paid. There was
barely any mozzarella in it! Wait-
rose do an inﬁnitely better feta pasta
salad that is a whole pound cheaper.
Granted, they do put less pasta, but
the quality is powers of ten higher.
Many powers of ten. Oh so many,
many, powers of ten.
Basically: more cheese please.
