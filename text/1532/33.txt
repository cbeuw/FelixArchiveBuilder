FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER
34
Grass is Greener
On the 14th of November, Adam Green
and Binki Shapiro graced the charming
Bush Hall in Shepherd’s Bush with what
one could probably describe as unique
blend of lo-ﬁ indie folk pop. Their set
opened with ‘If You Want Me To’ and
after a choppy start, mostly due to the
sound technician’s epic struggle to sort
out microphone levels, the band went on
to perform a myriad of enjoyable tunes;
surprising, as I was under the impression
that Adam and Binki’s ﬁrst album was
too much of a work in progress to have
built up such an appreciable repertoire.
Binki Shapiro, if you’ve never really
heard of her before, used to be a member
of super cool Brazilian/American band
Little Joy along with Rodrigo Amarate
and Fabrizio Moretti from The Strokes.
Green, on the other hand, is well known
for his involvement in the anti-folk music
movementservingashalfofabandcalled
TheMoldyPeaches. Green has also per-
formed as a solo artist, ﬁnding a consid-
erable amount of success in Germany as
well as the US where he met Shapiro who
colourfully describes the two of them as
having “ﬂoated into each other’s circles”
.
Regardless of knowing how they met,
you could tell Binki and Adam had a nat-
ural bond; they complemented each oth-
er really well. Surprisingly, Adam Green
seemed to have kept his usual abstract
lyrical mutterings under the hood, the
songs were comfortably accessible and,
not to mention, exceptionally charming -
a true testament to the combined talent
of the band. In general, the performance
was warmly received.
‘Just To Make Me Feel Good’ was a
beautifully chiming duet and ‘Collage’
, a
commendable tribute to James Gang’s
song from the late 60s, was a special song
andoneofmyfavourites.Thebandmade
the song a truly unique mix of their own
with bursts of brass heralding an excit-
ing instrumental with psychedelic un-
dertones as the song came to its climax.
I should say that the drummer made a
massive contribution to the build-up of
the song by emanating an electrifying
energy of such magnitude that it was
felt by the entire crowd of “warm bod-
ies” gathered there. This warm bodied
crowd was then treated to an acoustic set
closer, ‘Getting Led’
, a melancholy num-
ber performed with such conviction that
it soared over the dimly lit hall.
I should say that the initial problems
starting oﬀ never really detracted from
the overall rich and heart-warming per-
formance. The band truly found their
stride with a charming and pleasant
sound that never gave the impression of
trying too hard.
‘Here I Am’ is available to download for
free at adamandbinki.com. The planned
release of the album is on January 29,
2013 and I am sure it is going to be a
bloody good album.
RoloTomassigiveXOYOafright
On a chilly Halloween night, it was a
great idea to warm our bodies with
a pumped up punk show at XOYO
courtesy of Rolo Tomassi. Dressed as
the Addams family, with the spritely
lead singer, Eva Spence, appearing as
Morticia, the band kicks oﬀ the night
with ‘Howl’.
From the get-go the crowd were a
blur of ﬂying limbs and a stream of
witches hats and unravelling mummy
costumes. The band were really grate-
full for the crowds exuberant response
to new tracks from the latest album
Astrea. Normally I am not a fan of
this grindcore type genre but when
you are int the middle of the crowd
getting pummelled from both sides
by crashing synths and sweating bod-
ies, it is easy to understand the reason
for the movement’s faithful following.
The band is tighter than ever with ‘I
Love Turbulence’ , ‘Pill Fox, and ‘Old
mystries’ particularly impressive. Af-
ter an 18 month touring absence it
was great to see Rolo Tomassi back in
action and something more mature
than ever. I could hear some dickhead
metalheads behind me complaining
about the stage layout but these gripes
were small compared to the noise and
fun the band brought.
It is quite hard to deﬁne the music
which Rolo Tomassi make - is it math-
core, post hard-core or jazz metal? As
an Imperial square I like boundaries
and so music so experimental and
beautifully unpredictable is actually
quite unnerving. This should not put
anyone oﬀ, however, because some-
times it is great to immerse yourself in
something so bold yet disconcerting.
I am still quite a way from growing
my hair long and buying a Metallica
hoody [Sorry- I love stereotypes, which
are normally quite true for musical
tribes] but the night was far better
than expected. XOYO was an enjoy-
able venue and, although some of the
Mark England Music Editor
Mo Mirza finds a treat at Bush Hall
issues people have with the sound
quality became apparent during the
night, I would deﬁnitely swing by this
trendy hangout again. One thing is for
sure, Halloween will not be so crazy
next year!
