FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER 13
On Sunday 2nd December an army
of Santa Clauses will be taking to
the streets of London. They will
be marching from East to West
and they’re not alone. Santas will
be doing this all over other univer-
sity cities too: Bristol, Nottingham,
Cambridge, Bath, York, Oxford,
Durham… and even New York!
Kenyan Orphan Project (KOP)
and RAG have organised Santa-
themed charity-runs (well, more
of a light stroll) to raise money, in-
crease awareness and most of all be-
cause it will be awesome. In London
we’ll be starting off near King’s Col-
lege (Waterloo campus) and making
our way towards Imperial with stop-
offs for a few antics and photo snaps
at sights along the way… we’ll even
manage to squeeze in a few drinks.
Entry is only £5 and it all goes to
charity. KOP have also launched a
competition, best photo from the
Santa Dashes wins a free flight to
Kenya for the Student Summer Pro-
gramme!
We’d like to get as many peo-
ple involved as we can (to raise as
Run Santa Run!
Gospel go to Deloitte
What do a university gospel choir
and Deloitte, one of the four major
professional services companies,
have in common? Possibly more than
you might think...
In October, six members of Impe-
rial College Gospel Choir (ICGC)
made their way to Deloitte HQ, lo-
cated in the heart of the City, to per-
form at their annual Black History
Month event, which brings together
professionals from various compa-
nies to highlight pertinent issues,
celebrate success and promote pro-
gression.
The city workers were urged to
stand to their feet by ICGC music di-
rector, Glory Lai, to take part in a lit-
tle ‘praise and worship,’ in stark con-
trast to their usual daily activities.
The performance was well received,
with professionals breaking from
their corporate ways, singing and
clapping along to the music. Despite
being few in number, ICGC brought
some colour to the monochrome of
the square mile and as the ﬁnal act
of the evening, closed proceedings in
much as possible and also because
it’ll make Imperial look better than
the other London unis!). So start
getting creative with those costume
ideas! Santas, snowmen, a few rein-
deers to pull the sleigh? Anything
will do. Whether you want to do a
bit of sightseeing/have the opportu-
nity to run around London in fancy
dress/spread a little bit of Christmas
around town or simply help raise
some money for a worthwhile cause
(delete as appropriate), then come
along.
The Santas will be setting off at
1pm from King’s College (Waterloo
campus, exact location TBC via the
Facebook event page). If you’d like
get involved, email cag-kop@im-
perial.ac.uk or fill out the sign up
form at the Facebook event http://

KOP runs a two week student sum-
mer programme in July to work on
the projects which it supports in Ken-
ya. Applications close 1st December,

classic ICGC style. In return for our
performance, we were oﬀered free
canapés and drinks, and being typi-
cal students, these were gratefully
received. One corporate manager
seemed particularly touched by the
performance saying she was thankful
that ICGC had brought some ‘spir-
ituality’ into the City.
ICGC are well accustomed to per-
forming at other Imperial society
shows such as Afrogala and Mega
Maalai, however this event was the
ﬁrst of its kind in ICGC history. It
was an interesting and enjoyable ex-
perience, allowing ICGC to branch
out beyond the South Kensington
campus. Current ICGC President,
Daniella Osaghae, said after the
event, “I’m really proud of the posi-
tive feedback we received and we
hope to do more events like this in
the future”.
Since ICGC made its debut at
University Gospel Choir of the Year
(UGCY) in 2011, and a subsequent
appearance in 2012, there have been
many exciting opportunities. ICGC
graced the Wembley Arena stage
with Little Mix and Marcus in front
of 10,000 screaming fans on The X
Factor Final 2011, and more recently
took part in a world record attempt
in conjunction with UGCY, at West-
ﬁeld Stratford. Since its humble be-
ginnings seven years ago, ICGC has
grown in strength, numbers and
proﬁle. However, ICGC wouldn’t ex-
ist without its dedicated members,
giving up their Monday evenings to
rehearse and the Imperial College
Gospel Band, who work tirelessly
to bring everything together for our
Easter and Christmas shows.
As it is coming up to that time of
year again, ICGC will be performing
at their annual Christmas concert,
Good Tidings of Great Joy, at Holy
Trinity Church on Prince Consort
Road on December 4th at 7pm. Tick-
ets are available through the Union
Website.
