Rep Week is starting on Monday and it
gives our academic representation system
a chance to show off its many successes
on a departmental level. Just last month
a record number of students voted in our
Your Rep Elections and there are now
over 400 Academic Reps working, for
you, in every department of College. Their
aim is to improve your education.
There have already been some great
successes in your department and
we will be showcasing some of these
throughout the week which runs from
26 - 30 November. Keep checking the
Union website and follow our hashtag
#loveyourep on Twitter.
According to the Union Survey at the
end of last year 33% of undergraduate
students didn’t know who their Academic
Reps were. In response we have
launched our “Your Representatives A-Z”
section of the Union website. This is your
one-stop shop to find out who is your
Academic Rep as well as your Liberation
Zone reps or Halls reps if you are a first

The Union Survey is your chance to let
us know what you think about the many
services that we run and provide. At the
end of last academic year we ran the first
ever Union Survey and we have already
made positive changes as a result of
your feedback. Our ‘You said, we did’
campaign highlights the changes we have
made.
One of the most visible changes we
made was in launching this new website!
Union Survey - Open now
You said that the old site was slow and
hard to navigate, so when we were
thinking about our new site these were
the two most important elements for us.
Other changes include the reintroduction
of a wide-range of real ales in the Union
bars, an Everyday Value range in the
Union Shop and a comprehnsive Rep
Finder that helps you find out how
represents you in College and the Union.
