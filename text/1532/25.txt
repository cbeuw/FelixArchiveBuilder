FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER
uch like a prom-
ise to lower taxes,
a call for more
democracy is a
cheap tactic for
winning votes, yet one that, in what
seems to be a continuing trend, the
Conservative party have managed to
completely cock up.
For those of you who don’t know,
last Thursday saw England and
Wales’ ﬁrst election for the new role
of Police and Crime Commissioners
for each regional police force. These
representatives rank higher than
chief constables, and are to be the
accountable public face of the police.
If you’re wondering why you hadn’t
heard about this, it’s partially because
we don’t get the choice in London:
May’s election decided that Boris will
continue being ours – I’m sure that’ll
have you sleeping at ease tonight!
The picture is little better outside
of the capital. With an average turn-
M
The low turnout at the recent PCC elections is a bad sign
out of 15%, this is the UK’s worst
ever election in peace time. David
Cameron puts this down to it be-
ing a new role, and people’s lack of
understanding about what a PCC
does. An inquiry is being launched;
however, both of these show the To-
ries gracefully ignoring the elephant
in the room: their utter failure to
inform the public and publicise the
elections.
Few people were aware that the
PCC role had been created, and few-
er still knew when the election would
be – I and several of my friends were
only reminded by a Facebook status.
Those who were willing to vote had
very little information about the spe-
ciﬁcs of the role and the candidates –
the election’s oﬃcial website and that
of the Home Oﬃce are both wonder-
fully vague about what powers and
tasks a PCC has, talking about “being
accountable” and “invoking the voice
of the public.”
“Voter apathy” is the explanation
being touted by the media, but there’s
something deeper at work here. “On
November 15th,” read the adverts,
“criminals will hope you do nothing”
– a hilariously self-aware campaign,
given the circumstances. Apparently,
one shouldn’t assume malice when in-
competence will provide an adequate
explanation, but even if the govern-
ment isn’t wilfully stiﬂing democracy,
between this and the AV referendum
they can now look back and claim
that the public doesn’t want to vote
– something that does not bode well
for the future.
What can we learn from the elec-
tion results? Out of the 41 police
force regions, 16 were won by the
Conservatives, 13 by Labour and 12
by independent candidates. The Lib-
eral Democrat’s death knell was rung
at the last local elections, and this is
merely another nail in the coﬃn, but
the high independent result is in-
Keir Little
dicative of voters’ dissatisfaction with
all party politics. The rate of spoilt
votes was extremely high at around
3%. This isn’t mere voter apathy, but
voter opposition: people simply do
not want elected oﬃcials running the
police. With this in mind, perhaps it’s
not so surprising that the election
was so poorly advertised.
Whether by choice, or more likely
by incompetence, the government are
rapidly destroying the public’s conﬁ-
dence in the democratic process. A
look at the candidates paints another
troubling picture: they’re exclusively
rich, older white people, most likely
elected by their own kind. With their
failure to win voters by one of the
easiest tricks in the book – allowing
them more control and democracy
– the Tories now have little left but
to hope that the general elections see
only rich, older white people going to
the polling booths if they’re to sur-
vive for another term.
Moar elections!
Virgins: quit whining!

‘ve come to Imperial and
my sex life sucks! What
should I do?” Shut up and
relax!, that’s what!”That’s
what everyone should do
when problems like this arise. You see,
people, we all want to drive a nice car
but yet sometimes we are stuck with
a bicycle. What do you do then? Start
crying because you’re riding a bike?
No, keep working so you can buy a car
and who knows, maybe on the way you
will ﬁnd that you do not even want a
nice car.
No, guys, that is not necessarily a
metaphor and this article is not nec-
essarily about your sex life. I am just
highlighting most people’s common
problem with Imperial in the hope
that you read what I have to say. This
article intends not to solve your prob-
lem (if such a problem exists), but to
reduce its dramatic eﬀects. This arti-
cle is the psychologist of all who read
it – including I who wrote it. So sit
back on your chair, lie down on your
bed – whatever – just enjoy, relax, and
continue reading.
Firstly I am going to describe the ver-
itable domino chain of situations that
ﬁlled me with the inspiration to write
this. I have always believed that every-
one can create something marvelous,
just by exploiting those little moments
I
of inspiration that occur throughout
our lives. An inspirational moment
is a moment of extreme sentimental
charge which enforces the person who
is involved to storm out. The trick is to
direct this outﬂow of feelings to create
something. So there I was that Friday
night sitting alone in my living room
with dim lights, low volume back-
ground music, smoking shisha with a
sweet ﬂavor of watermelon and enjoy-
ing my hot chocolate accompanied by
plenty of smoke. My plans of going out
for drinks with my peers where aban-
doned. You see, I was kind of dumped
by my friends who were either out with
their girlfriends or just not there for
some reason. It was one of those nights
that one could either start complaining
in one’s mind about loneliness, or sim-
ply enjoy it. I therefore took my laptop
and NO, I did not visit those websites,
I simply started writing.
At this point you might actually be
wondering, where am I going with
this? Sometimes it can be hard to spot
the obvious. A bad situation may not
always be a truly bad situation; a prob-
lem may not always be a problem. The
easiest way to discover this is just to
look around. I catch myself being sad
because I missed the bus, I am sad
because I did not get a good mark in
a project I was assigned, I am sad be-
cause my team lost at football, I am sad
because I got rejected by that woman
at the bar, I was sad because I did not
go out that Friday night. WHAT? We
live in London, in the belief that it is
an enormous city but if we actually
take a look at Google Maps (not Apple
Maps!) we would discover that London
is just a tiny spot on that planet called
Earth. My point is that although we
think that we have problems, there are
much worse, much more real prob-
lems out there in this world.
I do not intend however to make you
forget your problems. Otherwise the
tiniest problems continue to exist as
problems, though they cannot be tack-
led by sitting on a couch and crying.
My suggestion is that we could actu-
ally do something and the ﬁrst thing
is just to stop complaining. I can say,
with no controversy, that Imperial stu-
dents complain a lot, and this is just
reﬂected in the student satisfaction as
well. The most interesting problem I
have spotted here at Imperial is actu-
ally a pair of problems. Getting back
on the title, guys are concerned about
the ‘’lack of females’’ (which directly ef-
fects their sex life), while mostly girls
are complaining about sexism. Dudes!
Wake up! For the ‘’lack of females’’ is-
sue, when a hunter ﬁnds no rabbits, he
just hunts elsewhere, or he even settles
with ducks, not being sure whether the
rabbit or the duck is mostly appreci-
ated. And about the sexism thing – it
should be tackled immediately when it
occurs but it also should not turn the
other way. Why attempting to create a
feminist society to tackle sexism (isn’t
that sexism itself?) instead of a unisex
anti-sexism society? Returning to my
initial point, the solution to any prob-
lem is not continuous ‘’crying’’ and
frivolous thinking but eﬀective actions
accompanied with peace of mind.
After all those paragraphs, some of
you might think that we went a little bit
oﬀ-track. The psychologist (the article
itself) suggests that we did not. We just
went through some relieving mecha-
nisms for what could be considered a
problem. Hopefully until now you may
start going back and forth, remem-
bering your troubles boosting your
conﬁdence with courage to overcome
them. On the other hand, you may
say ‘’gimme a break, you Hank Moody
wannabe’’. The point being though, that
satisfaction is a trophy to be won, not a
given present by any means. The truth
is that it was 3:34 AM when I was writ-
ing this, so I had to go to bed with this
being done. Hence, after reading this,
you either wasted your time, or you are
actually facing your problems (if any)
from a better angle. Goodnight.
