What we are all thinking
Do you even need me to tell you the rules? Construct a single
closed loop by joining the dots so that the numbered squares
are surrounded by the corresponding number of lines.
Fill the cells with numbers so that they add up to
the number on their right (for rows) or above them
(for columns). But wait! Each row or column can-
not contain the same number twice.
The Island of Knights and Knaves has been swept by an airborne disease that has caused
some of the inhabitants to become insane, meaning that every statement they believe
is wrong. As such, sane knights and knaves still always tell the truth and lie, but insane
knights (honestly) lie and insane knaves (deceptively) tell the truth!
Suppose you are a sane knave, and you want to let someone know that you are, indeed,
a sane knave.
What statement should you make?
You are implicated in a court case and you have but one witness. You have no idea what
his mental faculties are or whether he is a knight or a knave, but you are allowed to ask
him one question. You need to make absolutely sure that he does not reply with “no”.
What is such an appropriate question?
IfBweretoanswer“yes”,thenweimmediatelyknowthatheisaknightandthatAisaknave.How-
ever, if we were to know that, we could solve the puzzle. So, B must have answered “no”, and the
Noble would also have to answer “no” (as knowing B’s answer does not help us solve the riddle).
Assume now that the Noble said that B is a knave. Then, A can be either a knight or a knave with
nocontradiction.However,thepuzzleissolvableaftertheNoble’sanswer,sohemusthavereplied
that B is a knight, meaning that A is also a knight and that the elixir is worth buying.
Knights and Knaves
Solution to last week’s Knights and Knaves puzzle:
More nonogam goodness;
the numbers show you the
length of the groups of black
squares as well as how many
of them there are in a row or
column.

Hashi What you have to do is
link all the islands with
bridges so that no set
of islands are isolated.
Watch out, though; the
bridges have to be either
vertical or horizonal and
they must not intersect.
You can have up to two
bridges between any
two islands and each is-
land must have exactly
as many bridges as the
number on it states.
