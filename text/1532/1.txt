The tender process has come to an end
and the Holland Club will close the bar
on 21 December 2012. Commercial
Services will open a new, unnamed
outlet in the space at the end of Sep-
tember 2013.
There has been an ongoing campaign
to save the Holland Club amongst staﬀ
and students. The Facebook page of
the campaign, which has been regu-
larly updated, has so far garnered 946
likes. An online petition to save the
Holland Club received 661 signatures,
with multiple people leaving reasons
for why they are signing the petition.
On the College’s page inviting feedback
on the feasibility study performed on
the space, called Level 0, there were
76 comments asking for the Holland
Club to be left as it is. Most point to the
unique atmosphere, their belief
£100,000 well spent?
Union hires over £100,000
a year of new staff to help
represent you better and
“improve student experience.”
