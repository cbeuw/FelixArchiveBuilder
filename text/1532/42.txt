Hackers Unite!
Sam Wong introduces Imperial’s very own Hackathon
ackathons are magical.
Hackathons are non-
compulsory, unpaid,
but last long enough to
warrant overtime pay
and a day oﬀ in a normal corporate
environment. Yet somehow partici-
pants are highly engaged, and man-
age to produce creative solutions in
a much tighter timeframe. Why do
Hackathons work? What is the diﬀer-
entiating factor from regular work?
The ﬁrst one is focus. Online en-
trepreneur and author Jason Fried is
very vocal on this matter. He believes
work is like sleep. One doesn’t simply
go to sleep, one builds towards sleep.
The same applies to work: it takes time
to internalise the problem before one
can oﬀer an elegant solution. Yet, in
a normal day of work, water cooler
gossip, meetings, and managers con-
stantly distract workers; similar to
how REM sleep cannot occur with
constant interruptions, quality work
cannot be achieved in most ordinary
workplaces.
The second factor is motivation. Dan
Pink, bestselling author, gave a great
TED talk on “The Puzzle of Motiva-
tion”. To motivate one to produce qual-
ity creative work, ‘Autonomy, Mastery
and Purpose’ beats the ‘Carrots and
Sticks’ approach hands down. This
proposition is backed by the Glucks-
berg’s research on “Duncker’s Candle
Problem”. In this study, researchers
found that incentives only improve
performance in straightforward tasks.
When it comes to tasks that require
creativity, participants that received
monetary incentives based on perfor-
mance actually performed worse than
the control group who received no
prize! Another study from the Federal
Reserve Bank reported that for tasks
that called for ‘rudimentary cognitive
skill’, a larger reward “led to poorer
performance”. Dan makes the case
that ‘Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose’,
i.e. to direct one’s own life, to get bet-
ter at something that matters, and to
do something in the service of some-
thing larger than oneself, are the true
motivators to creative tasks.
The third diﬀerentiating factor is
that a Hackathon kills procrastination.
We all know the coursework takes an
hour to ﬁnish if we start one hour be-
fore the deadline. Without the Hack-
athon, you can create an idea anytime
between now and forever. However,
in a Hackathon time is of the essence.
“If I don’t join/ﬁnish the Hackathon, I
will need to do the same task but lose
the prizes plus swags plus the job of-
fer”.
Hackathons and similar autono-
mous work time has proven to be a
great innovation catalyst. It has pro-
duced a whole array of new products,
most famously Google’s GMail, Goog-
le News and Facebook’s like button
and timeline.
Now back at Imperial, what will
diﬀerentiate us from the rest of the
world? What makes Imperial great?
How can we make Imperial better?
I believe Imperial will beneﬁt from
the same process as major tech ﬁrms
have. Therefore, our best hackers are
being gathered to build something
that works and wows over one week-
end.
Last year, the Hackathon at Impe-
rial produced some very interesting
products. Heatnote, a new slideshow
player, allows students to tag confus-
ing parts of the slide live. Lecturer
can thus see in real time which part
of the slide requires further clariﬁca-
tion. Another winning team created a
system that automatically delivers rel-
evant notes to your devices, based on
your course and location. As you can
see, our hackers have already imple-
mented some great ideas.
For hackers who attended last years’
event, you know how great that was.
Our ﬁrst ever Hackathon last year
received rave reviews from Facebook
engineers, both on quality and origi-
nality. Therefore it is no surprise that
Facebook will be mentoring the teams
and scouting for talent in the event.
This year we are happy to have more
heavyweight partners. We are pleased
to have Microsoft engineers joining us
in the Hackathon, who will be provid-
ing mentors and judges, and Oxford
Instruments, who will be providing
Raspberry Pis for the event. Now we
truly have broadened the horizon of
possibilities!
Just as any other Hackathons, we
will have enough food and snacks to
keep everyone going over the week-
end. On top of that, we have organised
a few workshops to get you ready. We
will have workshops on Git, Mobile
Development, Facebook APIs and
Raspberry Pis. To help you make a
lasting impact, each team will receive
a server from us.
While you are free to work on what-
ever you want (in the true spirit of
Autonomy). To qualify for the ﬁnal,
your product must make a real, last-
ing impact. That means your code will
need to be on github, and your service
must be able to serve real users after
the event.
Of course, no Hackathon is com-
plete without some handsome re-
wards. We have prepared cash prizes
for the winning teams, and we have
angel investors ready to take your
products to the next level (hopefully
not just the winners!). HR from Face-
book and Microsoft will be joining us
in the after party, I am sure they will
be very interested in your CVs.
The Imperial Hackathon will be tak-
ing place in January – so get cracking
and submit your ideas to
ideas.ichackathon.com.
