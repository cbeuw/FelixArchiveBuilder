This week you’re a comput-
ing student. I have no joke
about you as I haven’t got the
faintest idea of what comput-
ing students do. Like are you
actually those people that we
pay £80 to when we leave
our laptop at PC world or is it
just like Maths but even more
boring? Answers on a post-
card please.
This week you find yourself
pushing on a pull door in front
of the whole JCR, who are
staring at you, half chewed
food sat there in their hang-
ing open mouths. Shamed,
you quickly buy your ba-
guette and get the hell out of
there. As you try to leave you
pull at the door… this clearly
isn’t your day.
This week you wonder:
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you han-
dle this? Beyoncé can you
handle this? I don’t think
you can handle this. While
these thoughts occur to
you, your reaction boils
over, all your product evap-
orates and you get 3/10 on
your lab report. Bugger.
This week you write an arti-
cle about sexism at Imperial
and publish it in Felix. BAD
MOVE BUDDY, your Twitter
account gets bombarded
with non-stop abuse, your
friends hate you and your
personal tutor no longer
looks you in the eye. You
give up on liberal debate
entirely.
This week you are made
manager of Chelsea Football
Club. There would’ve been
a time when that was cool
but frankly by now 3 of your
mates, your gran and that
hot girl from your lab group
have all had a bash. You
come home to find John Terry
sleeping with your girlfriend.
He racially abuses you.
This week you decided that
enough is enough with over-
priced, poor quality accom-
modation in Fulham and
move into the Queen’s Tower,
pitching a tent in the room
about 3/4s of the way up
where the campanologists
work. The view’s nice, but ul-
timately, you are surrounded
by bell-ends.
This week you’re in a dull tu-
torial when one of the really
shy Chinese girls farts incred-
ibly loudly. She looks almost
deathly with embarrassed, the
tutor is completely at a loss for
what to say and everything
stinks. If they think this is awk-
ward, imagine what it’s going
to be like when they realise
you just came in your pants.
This week you decided to get
ready for the holiday season
by mulling your own wine, just
enough for your own personal
consumption over this festive
period. Your flatmates don’t
look too kindly upon the state
of the bathtub once you’re
finished with it, but you’re too
drunk on ethanol fumes and
Christmas love to care.
This week you are Nadine
Dorries’s gall bladder. Ironi-
cally, as you’re literally full of
her bile, you have moderate,
progressive views on socio-
economic policy but the rest
of her body just ignores you.
A message comes down
from the brain, she’s eating
wallaby poo again. Sighing,
you get to work.
This week you go up to a girl
from the year below and say
“hey babe, I wish you were
my assessed problem sheet,
so I could do you on my desk
all night,” she replies “If you
were my assessed problem
sheet, I’d know everything
I’d need to know about you
by fucking your hot flatmate”
and walks away. Burn.
This week you decide to go
for a swim in the Thames,
fully clothed and holding
onto your bicycle. Okay so
decide was perhaps a kind
way of putting it, you re-
ally should’ve gotten those
dodgy brake pads fixed
while you had the chance.
Everyone on Putney bridge
laughs at you.
This week you are on a visit
to London Zoo when one of
the monkeys catches your
eye. Like actually catches
your eye. Screaming you
run around with 3 escaped
Tamarins clawing at your
face. You regret not listening
when everyone told you not
to wear that stupid banana
costume.

Well. The face
of the girl
on the left
definitely sums
up everyone’s
feeling when
they realise they
have to look
after someone
for the rest of
their night. To be
fair to him, he is
wearing a tux. I
guess that’s the
classiest way
to vom at a bus
stop. Right?
