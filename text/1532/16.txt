Pavitar Devgon reviews the ageing treaty
t has been nearly 15 years
since the governments
gathered in a stuﬀy assembly
hall on a December evening
and decided to enact the
Kyoto Protocol. It legally came into
eﬀect in 2005 and during this Green
Week, we have decided to see if it has
really made any diﬀerence.
According to the oﬃcial Kyoto
Protocol website: “The Kyoto Protocol
is an international agreement linked
to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. The
major feature of the Kyoto Protocol
is that it sets binding targets for 37
industrialized countries and the
European community for reducing
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.”
The main idea behind setting up the
Protocol was that the UN Convention
was not committing enough. Putting
in legal obligations, requirements
and ﬁxed numerical targets aimed to
encourage each of the 37 countries
that signed up to visibly reducing
their impact on the environment.
As well as meeting predetermined
“allowed emission targets” to reduce
emissions (which placed heavier
burden on the “more developed”
countries which historically polluted
more), countries were also able to:
• Buy ‘emission credits’ from coun-
tries that were below their allowed
pollution, or sell credits to countries
that were over theirs.
• Install emission-reducing or emis-
sion-limiting projects (which would
reduce targets by a certain about of
tonnes of CO2
)
Since the targets have been

Has Kyoto Really Been Successful?
enforced, most industrialised
countries aimed to cut their
emissions by 5% of the measured
1990 levels, though every signatory
set their own personal target. Britain,
and the rest of the EU, set their targets
at 8%.
Though oﬀ to a seemingly good
start, with measured reductions close
to 3% for industrialised countries,
a BBC article from 2005 expressed
doubt that the targets would be met:
“The UN says industrialised countries
are now well oﬀ target for the end of
the decade and predicts emissions
10% above 1990 levels by 2010.” A
Guardian news article published in
2010, however, had mixed views. The
European Environment Agency were
quoted saying that a “large drop in
emissions seen in 2008 and 2009 gives
EU-15 a head start to reach its 8%
reduction target”. Another source, the
Policy Exchange, measured emissions
stemming from the consumption of
goods and services to have increased
by over 40%.
Measuring and regulating this data
would not have been easy; there was
a lot of reliance on each committing
party generating an annual emissions
report and the registry system set up
in Germany was directed to “track
and record transactions”, meaning
that parties could not go overboard
trading credits and there would be an
authority in place to control it.
Nevertheless, not everyone has
taken kindly to the policy. Some
key players have pulled out of the
agreement, such as the US in 2001,
with the then President George Bush
If we taxed
the consump-
tion of Car-
bon Dioxide,
would we still
be nearing
the 400ppm
mark, regard-
ed as the tip-
ping point?
saying that making the required
changes and implementing the
strategies required would damage the
US economy. Canada have also pulled
out; with their estimated costs at
$13.6bn (£8.7bn), the government felt
that this was unreasonable to pursue
and was the result of “an incompetent
Liberal government”. The Russian
government supported this decision
and pulled out shortly after.
More recently, climate change has
been a driving force in almost every
economy, whether for or against. The
Copenhagen Climate Conference
in 2009 sought to bring countries
together, on a larger scale than
Kyoto, in order to address the issues
and create an eﬀective accordance.
However, it was ill fated and many
governments, including China’s,
refused to ratify it, or simply walked
out.
Other talks include the Bonn
Climate Change Conference held in
May of this year. Dubbed Kyoto 2, it
had hopes of extending the targets
initially penned in 1997, though it
ended in similar disappointment, with
a split occurring between the more
actively involved parties (such as the
group of Least Developed Countries
and Alliance for Small Island States)
while other governments were
more sluggish and still resistant to
change. New Zealand joined the
list of countries refusing to sign,
despite Australia and many others
committing to stay on course.
What else is possible? Clearly these
climate talks are not as eﬀective as
many hoped they could be so what
else can we do? Perhaps one of the
failures of the Kyoto Protocol was that
it placed emphasis on reducing carbon
production, without mentioning
anything about carbon consumption.
A recent Guardian article posed the
question of carbon taxing, which
would strike the problem at its root.
Rather than paying for producing so
much carbon dioxide, if we taxed the
consumption of it, which includes
importing carbon from external
sources, would we still be nearing the
400ppm mark (400 part per million
of CO2
in the atmosphere), which is
regarded as the tipping point?
The main resistance to adopt any
sort of climate change reduction
project is primarily the cost. Whether
governments or consumers, everyone
tries to ﬁnd the cheapest alternative.
Therefore carbon pricing could
be eﬀective – raising the cost of
producing carbon, so people feel
that it is no longer the best option.
However, this relies on governments
accepting it and honestly, even taxing
will not necessarily solve the problem.
Now that Kyoto has ended, it
is time to once again time for the
governments to get together and
discuss the future. Despite all the
failures, many highly developing
countries including India, China and
Brazil will push for an extension of
the Protocol. India’s Chief Climate
Negotiator, R. R. Rashmi said in the
Wall Street Journal: “If ways are not
found to extend the Kyoto Protocol,
there could be a period of eight years
without any global climate pact in
place, as a new agreement is due to
come into eﬀect only after 2020.” The
talks will be held in Doha, starting on
26th November 2012.
It seems we have made some
progress,butwhilemanygovernments
still cannot commit to these talks,
then is there really any point in having
them? At least the countries that
have realised the threat are taking
it seriously and acting to prevent or
mitigate future disasters, while the
rest stand resolutely opposed.
