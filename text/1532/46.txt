TWITTER HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK
Ed Miliband @Ed_Miliband
The person who shouted during the speech by a year 11 pupil was totally
wrong and doesn’t speak for Labour. The hundreds who applauded her do
Ed Miliband, Leader of
the Opposition, or, as Mitt
Romney would call him “Mr.
Leader”, puts a heckler in
their place with a slam dunk
of a zinger. #theygotparred

INTERESTING THOUGHTS
FOR THE DAY
“Why do people think that chewing
gum will instantly make bouncers at
nightclubs not realise that they have
been drinking? Surely, every bouncer
knows this ‘trick’ and therefore would
be on the lookout for it?”
“Has there ever been a time when
someone really wants to know how
many of one specific group of people it
would take to change a light bulb?”
“Do different pasta shapes taste dif-
ferent? Why the plethora of options?”

Iheardyousay“I always show my boobs” as I walkedpast. I
would love to show you my boobs. – Ahornyperson
I saw you in the library and when you talked about fluid
dynamics I got a good test of my wetting system. If you want
some, find me in the Library elevator. I’ll be the one going up
one floor. – Stressed in the library
When you dropped that test tube in the lab I wanted to frag-
ment something else. Your ego. With my amazing loving. I
hope to be your solute and make you wet. Me and you, now
that’s a good solution. – Mixologist
You solved an equation in the library and shouted “yes!” under
your breath. I thought it would be a good idea to say hi but
didn’t have the courage. I also remembered that I thought it
was a good plan to do engineering at university and that it
would be all building cars. It makes me doubt my judgement
a bit. – Engineering who was lured in by the promise of F1 car
making.
