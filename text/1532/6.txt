Student protest march held
Last Wednesday, 21 November 2012,
saw thousands of students marching
through the streets of London to
protest the rising cost of education.
Dubbed “Demo 2012”, the demon-
stration, arranged by the National
Union of Students (NUS)expect-
ed to have 10,000 attendees. The
demonstration by the NUS passed
through central London from the
Embankment before heading south
of the river at Westminster. Police
refused to make an estimate of the
crowd. However, it was estimated
that between 3,000 and 4,000 were
involved. Bad weather was cited as a
reason for the lower than 10,000 at-
tendance. This is still a much lower
figure than the 50,000 strong crowd
of two years ago when the protests
occured over raising Tution Fees.
Liam Burns, NUS President, said
that “education should open doors,
but the government is slamming
them shut,” He went on to say that
“the damaging effects of recent
changes to education have restricted
access for future students and cre-
ated new barriers for those currently
studying,”
With current 1st years now pay-
ing up to £9,000 per year for Tui-
tion Fees, the aim of the protest was
largely to put education back on the
political agenda, highlighting issues
such as the impact caused by the
new higher fees and reduced finan-
cial support. The lack of job oppor-
tunities for young people was also
highlighted.
The mood on Wednesday was
generally calm, with the Metropoli-
tan Police reportedly only needing
to quash one small riot. Their so-
called “total policing” ensured that
no other riots got under way during
the march. However, the internal
mood of the NUS could not be said
to be quite so calm with many rally-
goers feeling betrayed by the NUS
and their President Liam Burns for
not managing to stop the initial rise
of fees.
A final rally in Kennington Park
saw Burns heckled and pelted with
eggs by the thinning crowd as he
made his speech. Shortly after, his
stage was invaded by some of the
aforementioned disgruntled stu-
dents. Burns was not dismayed, add-
ing, “It was just a bit of a distraction.
I’m not going to get particularly
bogged down by a few people who
want to shout in a rained out park.”
Students feel their point was made
with attention drawn to higher fees
and the impacts from them.
Imperial College Union did not
send any representatives.
