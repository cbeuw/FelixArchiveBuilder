Sex? Completely Overrated
s much as you may
think the contrary,
and that this advice is
hardly required for the
average Imperial stu-
dent, avoiding sex is really quite dif-
ﬁcult. That is, for a species to survive,
its genome must be kept up-to-date
through the ‘shuﬄing’ eﬀects of re-
combination and sexual reproduction.
Without it, evolution simply can’t
happen quickly enough in the ﬁght
against threats such as parasites.
Enter the bdelloid rotifers – truly
inspiring creatures, am I right? Well,
okay, but most biologists at least hold
some respect these tiny little freshwa-
ter organisms. Take a sample of water
from a pond or some damp soil, look at
it under a microscope and you’ll prob-
ably ﬁnd a few roaming about, using
their ciliated mouthparts to scoop up
bits of algae and other protists. They
are particularly special, as not only
can they survive radiation and other
unwelcome environments by enter-
ing a form of indeﬁnite dormancy, but
they just don’t have sex.
Sure, we know of other organisms
that reproduce asexually (essentially
making clones of yourself) such as
aphids, but most of these have sex at
least some of the time. Of those who
don’t, they have diverged fairly recent-
ly from their sexual ancestors, and so
are likely to die out relatively soon. On
the other hand, the all-female bdelloid
rotifers don’t seem to have reproduced
sexually for around 80 million years.
This is a dry spell that deserves some
serious attention.
It had already been known that these
guys (well, girls) have a very clever
way of repairing their DNA, which al-
lows them not to be bothered by ionis-
ing radiation and means that they can
SCIENCE
A Brief History of Time Pigs
Ninety-seven million years ago pigs
and humans were one of the same.
Well, sort of. There wasn’t exactly a
four-trottered, bristly-nosed Homo-
something snuﬄing through the Cre-
taceous. But we did share a common
ancestor, a small generic mammal
prototype, whatever that might be.
Actually it probably looked like
an extinct creature called Juramaia
sinensis, the oldest known eutherian
(non-marsupial) species. Pop a with-
ered, earless Dachshund head onto an
obese rat, and that might paint a very
vague picture. Anyway, this is about
pigs.
As eutherian mammals we reached
a fork in the road: humans and ro-
dents went one way; cows, horses,
dogs, and pigs the other.
Recent analyses of the genome of
domestic and wild pigs, under the
auspices of the Swine Genome Se-
quencing Consortium, have shed new
light on pig evolution.
The scientists compared the genom-
es of ten wild boar and six domestic
pigs from diﬀerent areas across Eu-
rope and Asia.
Their ﬁndings, published in Nature,
conﬁrm the fact that boars (and all
pigs) emerged from South East Asia
and subsequently spread across Eura-
sia.
About one million years ago colder
climates during the Calambrian gla-
cial intervals isolated the two popula-
tions. A deep chasm formed between
European and Asian boars.
Then – to leap forward 80,000 years
– during the Last Glacial Maximum
(LGM) about 20,000 years ago vast
swathes of boar died. But a small
proportion survived. They suﬀered a
population bottleneck on both sides
of the split. However, this drop in
population was more pronounced in
Europe than in Asia where the LGM
had less impact. For this reason the
researchers found that European
boar had less genetic diversity than
Asian boar. With fewer genotypes in
circulation the diﬀerence between
Asian and European pigs was driven
further.
Enter humans and domestication.
About 10,000 years ago pigs and hu-

They take

repair any damage after coming out
of dormancy. It was thought that this
system could possibly be maintaining
the genetic variation required. While
this could still help, researchers at Im-
perial and Cambridge have discovered
there is in fact a more understandable
way of getting over millennia without
a signiﬁcant other.
Food. Eating a tub of ice cream is
certainly one way of consoling your-
self, but the bdelloidea do something
rather special with their meals. They
assimilate them. More speciﬁcally,
they take the DNA from their food
and incorporate it into their own ge-
nome. Which, by the way, is extremely
cool.
Some nifty bioinformatics and anal-
ysis have shown that the proportion
of the bdelloid’s genes that have come
from other organisms (known as hori-
zontal gene transfer) is around 9%.
This is astoundingly high compared to
other multi-cellular organisms such as
the biologists favourite fruit ﬂy (Dros-
ophila melanogaster – around 0.6%)
or nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans
– around 1.8%). What’s more is that
these genes appear to have come from
the fungi, algae, protists and bacteria
that make up the average bdelloid ro-
tifer diet.
These genes aren’t just there by ac-
mans embarked on an intimate and
complex relationship. Hmm. This
lead to even greater selective pres-
sures that shaped the genome of do-
mestic pigs. In Europe the result was
Sus scrofa domesticus, the pork-chop-
Must resist urge to make a terribly
clichéd joke about pigs and bacon...
and-bacon variety. Incidentally, there
are about one billion domestic pigs
alive today, which makes S. s. domes-
ticus one of the most numerous large
mammals on the planet.
By 1868 the populations were so
diﬀerent that Darwin proposed they
originated from two distinct boar
species. But this study shows that
both Asian and European pigs arose
from the Eurasian wild boar (Sus
scrofa). This analysis tells us that pigs
were domesticated independently
across Europe and Asia. It also rein-
forces the historical observation that
Asian pigs were introduced into Eu-
rope during the 18th and 19th centu-
ries to bolster European herds.
The researchers go on to describe
the pig’s enormous repertoire of ol-
factory genes. Smelling is vital to
their scavenging lifestyle. So have a
bit of sympathy when you next pass
a pig farm – their eyes are watering
more than yours.

Charlie Hayward discusses why one class of creature shuns sex
cident either; they have a strong eﬀect
in increasing the biochemical diver-
sity of these creatures. Some of them
code for some really important meta-
bolic enzymes involved in processes
such as glycolysis and carbon ﬁxation,
as well as toxin degradation and an-
tioxidant generation. Some of genes
encode for processes that aren’t else-
where found in the animal kingdom,
and now we know why. Stealing a link
in the metabolic pathway of the fungi
you are eating can certainly give you a
novel advantage!
So, whenever you’re feeling lonely
and the chocolate bar wrappers are
mounting up, think of the humble
yet awesome bdelloid rotifer. Unless
you’re a member of the Borg, assimi-
lation is sadly out of your reach. Of
course, if you do manage to spawn life
at some point and keep the gene pool
nicely varied then you have no need to
worry. If not, then you probably know
what a Borg is.
