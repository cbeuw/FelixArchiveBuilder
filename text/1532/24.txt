It takes two to tango
The state of current libel laws is ludicrous; they must adapt to the
digital age, says George Butcher
George Butcher
Are you facing charges?
his week the biggest li-
bel case in legal history
was launched – thou-
sands of people are
potentially facing legal
action and most of them are ‘normal
people’. Why? Because anyone who
tweeted or re-tweeted Lord McAlp-
ine’s name in relation to child abuse
allegations is going to get a letter
from his lawyers, and it doesn’t mat-
ter if you deleted it later.
Twitter is now considered by the
courts to be equivalent to a printed
publication. If I wrote defamatory
remarks about someone there, say
the Rector, which I couldn’t back up,
both myself and the editor would po-
tentially be facing a civil law suit. Li-
bel laws are designed to prevent rep-
utations from being destroyed by lies
and to protect all of us. Now, though,
this means that anything I tweet also
follows the same rules. How did this
happen?
Eight months ago was the ﬁrst li-
bel case involving Twitter. Cricketer
Chris Cairns was awarded £90,000
plus £400,000 legal expenses from
Lalit Modi, the deposed IPL com-
missioner, who had tweeted he had
been barred due to “his past record
in match-ﬁxing”. This allegation was
seen by an immense crowd of follow-
ers (69 to be precise) and almost went
viral with nearly 1100 people see-
ing it re-tweeted. That’s £81 a head.
Cairns’ lawyers did what they would
if Lalit Modi had printed his opinions
in a paper and the judge agreed with
them saying that, “nowadays the poi-
T
son spreads more rapidly”.
We now have an insane situation. It
is a ridiculous one and it is a result
of a legal decision made by a judge
with no mandate to do so. Fixing li-
bel law for the digital world is the
job of parliament. Mr Justice Bean
has independently made one of the
most consequential legal decisions of
recent years. Twitter is not a publica-
tion: Twitter is ﬂeeting and informal.
A tweet is closer to a text message or
a chat with friends, not a written dec-
laration of one’s position. You can’t
sue me if I tell my friends I think a
Tory peer abused children. You can’t
sue me if I text them, or even if I dis-
cuss it in public. You can’t legislate
against gossip because frankly that’s
inhuman. Twitter is full of satire,
opinions and attention seekers. It is
the ultimate in human expression,
not an oﬃcial belief.
If you did tweet it, don’t worry.
The Telegraph says that his lawyers
expect to ask for nominal payment
of £5 and for the proceeds will go to
charity, but this misses the point. Ten
thousand users are facing legal ac-
tion for gossiping, most often with
friends. This is wrong.

Feminism needs to engage with men if it is to achieve its goals,
argues Jula Humprhies
he word feminism itself
does not include men
into the equation. Yet,
men should be just as
active as women in the
movement towards gender equality.
This should be the accepted norm,
which it appears to be at university,
as proven by the high percentage of
guys involved in the Feminist so-
ciety. Certain aspects of feminism
should perhaps be solely dominated
by women; but the majority of it
must equally involve men in address-
ing gender inequalities. If society is
to act, think and behave differently
it will only occur through both sexes
bringing about change. We women
cannot make change alone for it al-
T
ways takes two to tango.
A man who supports a woman
must be heralded by society as oc-
curs vice versa. House husbands and
stay at home dads must be lauded
equally as their female equivalents.
Our laws should reflect these senti-
ments, terms such as maternity and
paternity leave should not exist. It
should be parental leave, where the
couple decides who takes time off
and potential percentages. Let us
scrap matriarchies and patriarchies,
we need new ‘archies’.
Elizabeth Garrett Anderson would
not have become England’s first fe-
male Doctor without her father’s
support. Just as President Obama,
would not have become President
without Michelle’s support. The fact
of the matter is that great women
have great men behind them and
great men have great women behind
them. People need to be pushed and
supported from one another, regard-
less of gender and societies must
work towards this and maintain it as
status quo.
More men must define themselves
as fathers and husbands on Twitter
and other platforms. Just as women
do. A man ought to feel at ease if his
partner earns more and he should
feel proud changing a nappy. A
Mother should teach her sons how
to ice buns and a Dad his daughters
how to change a bog’s lift rod. Wom-
en should push men and men should
support women in these actions. Of
course, the pushing and supporting
should swing both ways and applies
to couples of every shape and form,
whether they are gay, straight, trans-
sexual, bi-sexual or bi-cultural etc.
Society, the media and our educa-
tion systems must be geared towards
this. Our societal values should place
housewifery/husbandry on par with
being a CEO. Women are typically in
the former category and society typ-
ically has a higher respect for the lat-
ter. This must change. Equal respect
and opportunity are the pillars upon
which gender equality is and will
continue to be built. And we women
must work together with men to in-
stil these changes.
