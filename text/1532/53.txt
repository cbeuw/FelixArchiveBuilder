FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER

Shorinji Kempo
It is a Sunday morning in Finsbury
Park. Unusually for London in No-
vember, the sun’s rays play across the
city, giving relief from the slight chill
in the air. The lack of any discernible
tension in the air conceals the fact
that the area will soon see the com-
mencing of the 2012 British Shorinji
Kempo Federation (BSKF) Taikai
Competition.
Although generally non-compet-
itive, Shorinji Kempo, a Japanese
martial art that combines striking
techniques with throws and pins,
does occasionally hold tournaments
in order to showcase its practition-
ers’ skill. Since its inception, Imperial
College dojo – training under the ex-
pert tutelage of Sensei Sean Dixie –
has been feared throughout the land
for the intensity and ﬂair of its mar-
tial artists. Indeed, more than one
Saturday afternoon training session
has elicited complaints from neigh-
bouring residents due to the noise
emanating from the Union Gym.
With a sharp call to attention, the
day’s contest began. A quick, group
warm-up receded into the opening
ceremony and without any pause
to catch breath the audience was
thrown straight into a heady mael-
strom of competition.
Opening proceedings was the kumi
embu category, where a choreo-
graphed ﬁght sequence is performed
by two competitors. Imperial’s en-
trants were the maverick duo of Mak-
sim Mijovic and Aditya Narayanan,
dubbed ‘The Flying Moustaches’ for
their matching, Movember-inspired
moustaches (http://uk.movember.
com/team/563989, in case anyone
is interested). A frenetic 90 seconds
of action unfolded, transﬁxing the
audience who gasped and groaned
at the audacity and ﬂamboyance on
display. The main challenge for the
title came from Cambridge dojo, re-
sponding with a slick, polished ﬁght
showing no less ability. The judges
deliberated for what seemed like an
eternity on what was a tough-fought
category, but although Cambridge
was a worthy contender for the top
slot, Imperial’s superior facial hair
made the diﬀerence – prevailing by
three points.
After emerging victorious from
the ﬁrst event of the day, the whole
of Team Imperial were fully psyched
up for the oncoming battles. The next
contest of interest would be the dan-
tai embu, where groups of more than
two people perform various sequenc-
es together. Representing the ﬁne
institution we call Imperial would be
our very own magniﬁcent six – all of
whom had only started kempo a few
weeks previously. The sextet moved
in perfect unison with a ﬂuidity and
passion that belied their relative lack
of experience. Alas, it was not to be
their day as a strong City University
line-up struggled to narrowly pip
them to third place despite greatly
outranking their Imperial counter-
parts.
The ﬁnal contest of the day was the
eagerly anticipated randori (sparring)
competition, with the club being rep-
resented by housewives’ favourite
Maksim Mijovic. Buoyed by his earli-
er victory in the kumi embu category,
Maks began his ﬁrst round bout in
style, bamboozling his opponent with
a ﬂurry of fancy footwork. Unable to
contain his enthusiasm, he risked dis-
qualiﬁcation with a ﬂying kick that
drew a warning from the judges. Un-
deterred, Maks put this setback be-
hind him to prevail with a succession
of accurate blows. His second round
opponent was Canute of City dojo – a
formidable opponent widely consid-
ered favourite to take the trophy. This
match-up required a special perfor-
mance, and Maks did not disappoint,
bringing his patented ‘crab foot’ tech-
nique to the party. Shimmying here
and there, Maks’ launched a series of
attacks, making a few clean contacts.
Canute himself showed his previous
taekwondo experience with impecca-
bly timed counters. The match drew
to a close with Maks having made
more hits in total; it just remained to
be seen whether they were consid-
ered clean enough on points. A sigh
of tension rippled through the crowd
as it was clear that the decision was
being hotly debated by the judges.
The verdict came in, and Maks was
controversially denied progress to
the next round leading to no rioting
in the stands whatsoever.
With that, Imperial’s odyssey was
ended prematurely having earned one
trophy for the cabinet (read: locker)
and the hearts of the neutrals with
the dojo’s trademark panache. As the
dust settled on the arena and the en-
tire team of competitors and support
chewed over the action they’d seen.
With one victory claimed, and a team
of newcomers giving seasoned vet-
erans an almighty fright, the verdict
was unanimously a resounding suc-
cess.

Having made a fantastic start to the
season with two impressive wins,
the fixture against King’s College
London was eagerly anticipated, if
approached with slight trepidation.
In the previous three encounters
last season, King’s had won con-
vincingly on all occasions which
led to their promotion in BUCS.
However, they many of their start-
ing line-up had graduated in the
interim. In form, this fixture was
set to be the first true test of how
far Imperial has come since gaining
momentum last season.
Things did not start well for IC.
Taking to the pitch, Kings were
already warmed up and firing on
all cylinders. They kicked off the
game and set up camp deep in the
IC territory for much of the first
half, kicking effectively to put
themselves inside the 22.
The IC pack dominated in the
scrum to win back some posses-
sion, with hooker Lana Lee turning
over the ball on several of Kings’
put-ins. However, the pressure was
too much and a failed clearance
kick from the IC try-line was taken
in by the Kings forwards.
From 0-5 down, kicking let IC
down again. At the restart, the
ball was caught by the opposition
10 who evaded several tackles and
showed her pace to cross the try
line. The conversion was simple
and IC found themselves 0-12 be-
hind.
The half was drawing to a close
but not before IC could respond
with a try of their own. After the
pack drove King’s off their scrum
again, substitute Caitlin ‘Red’ Jack-
son made an immediate impact,
picking up the ball from number 8.
Handing off three players, Red then
off-loaded to scrum half Kath Fok
who ran a tight supporting line and
was put through in space behind
the King’s defense. Sprinting to
leave the opposition behind, Kath
scored under the sticks and Lana
secured the extra points with the
conversion.
The second half began with the
score at 7-12 and IC immediately
turned up the heat on Kings who
fumbled the catch from the kick.
Strong rucking at the breakdown
and more good scrummaging put
King’s on the back foot. They at-
tempted to clear their lines from
just outside the 5m line, but the
King’s kicker was charged down
by the face of Kath who followed
the ball under the posts to score a
second try in a feat of impressive
reflexes and creativity. Another
conversion from Lana put IC in the
lead 14-12.
With the half barely underway,
the King’s pack tried to plough their
way back making it into the IC 22,
but IC were wise not to commit too
many players to the breakdown and
maintain the defensive line. Turn-
ing over the ball in the scrum, the
backs carried the ball away. IC were
then able to hold their composure,
despite high tensions, until the fi-
nal whistle. The win against a team
in a higher league puts the thus far
undefeated ICUWRFC at the top
of LUSL whilst they await BUCS
matches beginning at the end of
November.
