Pipeline Plans in North America
B
arack Obama, the newly
elected President of the
United States, was widely
believed to be the ‘Green
Candidate’ in the American elec-
tions. However, in a country where
one of the two main political parties
adopts the slogan of “drill baby drill”
in its environmental policy, one
can hardly be forgiven for meeting
Obama’s green policies with an air of
scepticism.
However Obama does have a
record of action. In 2009, Obama
passed the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act, that lead to more
than $80 billion in green energy
investments, alongside with cutting
$4 billion in annual tax breaks for oil
companies in his last administration.
In 2011, at the State of the Union
Address, Obama called for 80% of
America’s electricity to be provided
by green means by 2035. Also, a
strong Democrat stance on the
environmental issues makes sense:
in a recent survey, 70% of the so
Joseph Spiking asks: In the land of oil and climate change sceptics,
does environmentally friendly policy stand a chance?
called independent voters classified
themselves as environmentalists.
Therefore, what can we expect to
see from Obama’s Administration in
his second term? Well:
• Renewal of the tax credit scheme
for utility scale wind producers, and
has pledged to support to aid loan
guarantees and grants for green en-
ergy companies.
• Has gained support from major
motor-vehicle manufacturers to
double fuel economy for light trucks
and cars by 2025.
• Obama has pledged to uphold the
power of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA) to regulate green-
house emissions. Obama has also
publicly supported the EPA’s stance
on limiting emissions from old coal
fired power plants.
However, perhaps the biggest
challenge Obama shall face regarding
his green ambitions shall come with
the Keystone Pipeline System (KPS).
The KPS, in its current guise, is a
transport system used to transport
crude oil from Alberta, Canada to
multiple destinations in the USA
– ranging from Oklahoma, the
Gulf Coast of Texas and Illinois. In
2008, an extension to the existing
pipeline was proposed, dividing
the American political spectrum.
Mitt Romney promised to give the
project the green flag on his first
day in the White House if he got
elected, whereas Obama took a
more considered approach. Obama
was not alone – opposition to its
expansion was heard from various
bodies, most notably the EPA.
The EPA argued that the pipeline
could risk the natural habitat of
migratory birds and other wildlife,
alongside considerable concerns
over the pipeline crossing active
seismic zones that would greatly
increase the chances of a potential
oil spillage – which in turn could
not only destroy the natural habitat
and wildlife, but also destroy the
local drinking water and the entire
Iskander Malaysia – as green as they say?
You don’t have to be an urban planner
or an environmentalist to recognise
that continued urbanisation along-
side green living is the future of the
planet. I’m certainly not. So we might
as well do it right by considering the
environmental implications of new
urban development projects, and any
scheme that does this will get at least
one big green tick in my book.
Iskander Malaysia is one such
undertaking in Johor Bahru,
Malaysia’s second biggest city, which
lies across the sea from Singapore
and is connected to its illustrious
neighbour by a causeway. Location-
wise it is ideal for Singapore’s
workers, many of whom live in Johor
and commute to Singapore to work.
The Iskander project is an 850
square mile economic zone the size of
Luxembourg and three times the size
of Singapore set to host a population
of 3 million by 2025. Traditional
rivals, Malaysia and Singapore,
have teamed up with regards to this
development, which should beneﬁt
both in the long-run. Malaysia
gets a chance to boost lacklustre
economic growth and Singapore will
be in a better position to maintain its
competitive edge, which is threatened
by increasing living costs.
Iskander has been touted as an eco-
friendly city by the Guardian recently.
Indeed, one of its main aims is to be
“a strong sustainable metropolis of
international standing”. The plan
is that this will be achieved by
utilising renewable energy sources,
practising energy-eﬃcient building,
implementing a green transportation
policy, water conservation,
biodiversity preservation, and waste
reuse, among other aspects. The
website explicitly heralds Iskandar
Malaysia as “a Land of Nature, Parks
and Gardens.”
Well, this sounds great. But as
I scoured the internet for more
information, I found that current
articles relating to Iskander are about
foreign investment. It seems the
project is mostly focused on money.
Realistically that’s no surprise. But
does this indicate that all of the
ecological talk is just greenwash?
Cynically we have to consider this
possibility, especially as upon delving
into the website’s FAQ section I found
that environmental sustainability
is not one of the main sector areas
being targeted by the development.
On the one hand, an urban
development three times bigger
than Singapore but with only half
the population doesn’t look to be a
particularly eﬃcient use of space. But
perhaps the city itself will be dense,
and the remaining area dedicated
to biodiversity preservation or food
production. The idea of redeveloping
an already-urbanised area rather than
destroying unpopulated landscape,
as has been the situation before, is
certainly preferable. Yet one protest
group has already accused the
development of polluting waterways.
Inspection of Iskander’s
transportation policies looks
promising: with aims to not only
encourage use of public transport
or bicycles, but to try and limit the
adverse environmental eﬀects of
motor transport by improving fuel
technology, enhancing fuel economy,
car-sharing schemes, and developing
alternatives to petroleum fuels.
However, I very much doubt it will
be that easy to change the minds –
and habits – of commuters. Since
Johor is the primary link between
Singapore and Malaysia, it’s also
diﬃcult to imagine how pollution can
be reduced when even more vehicles
will use the connecting causeway
every day.
It’s probably (hopefully) too early
to tell whether Iskander will fulﬁl its
promises. I don’t want to be a cynic,
even though previous eco-city plans
have struggled. I’d prefer to believe
that Iskander Malaysia will walk
the walk as well as talking the talk.
Then (but only then) will it serve
as the model “green megacity” its
developers have envisaged.

mid western economy. However, as
predicted, the Keystone XL pipeline
has received great support from
the Republicans, the Republican
controlled Senate forcing Obama’s
hand multiple times over a final
decision on the pipelines future.
Obama has managed to delay the
date of final approval regarding the
pipeline to the first half of 2013 –
and it is this date that is likely to
prove diagnostic of Obama’s green
policy for the next four years.
