FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER
“Shamazeballs?”
Lucia Podhorska thinks it was more of a shambles
ith it being
‘Guilty Pleas-
ures’ week on
The X-Factor, I
thought it oddly
fitting to finally share my thoughts
on the current season of one of the
world’s most famous ‘talent’ shows.
The X-Factor was created by Si-
mon Cowell and began its run on
ITV back in 2004. The show has five
stages: after initial Producers’ audi-
tions that take place months before
the broadcast shows, acts perform in
front of four judges, as well as a live
audience. In order to advance to the
next round, called Bootcamp, the
singers must receive at least 3 ‘yes’
votes from the judges. During Boot-
camp, the number of contestants is
narrowed down to the judges’ Top
24. These hopefuls are split into four
categories – Boys, Girls, Groups and
The Over 28s – with each judge be-
ing chosen to mentor one category.
At the Judges’ Houses stage, each
judge eliminates a further three
acts. There are therefore 12 acts
that perform in the Live Shows. This
season finds Gary Barlow (leading
man from Take That) mentoring
The Over 28s, Nicole Scherzinger
(need I tell you who she is?) mentor-
ing the Boys, Tulisa Contostavlos
(member of N-Dubz) mentoring the
Girls and Louis Walsh (manager of
Boyzone and Westlife) mentoring
Groups.
Right, with all that out of the way,
let’s discuss what is expected of the
12 finalists in the Live Shows. It’s
very simple, really: each act sings
one song, with each week having a
different theme, ranging from Love
and Heartbreak to Best of British.
After each performance, the judges
are meant to give their opinion on
the act, potentially even be useful
and give them some advice on how
to improve. Unfortunately, this part
of the show very often deteriorates
into heated arguments between
judges, with attitude and insults fly-
ing around like frisbees, and no real
constructive criticism being offered.
At the end of the show, all of the
contestants sing together and then
it’s over to the people at home to
send in their votes. The results are
revealed on Sunday night, at which
point the two acts with the least
votes sing for their survival. The
judges must choose who to send
home and in the case of a tie, it’s the
number of audience votes that de-
termines the singers’ fate.
I missed the auditions this season
and only really tuned in once the
acts made it through to Bootcamp.
I picked my personal favourites
quickly and was hesitantly optimis-
tic about the quality of the acts that
would compete in the finals, as it
seemed that the judges were finally
picking real singers, not just pretty
faces. Here is a breakdown of the
contestants still in the running:
The Boys
It was touch and go for Jahmene
Douglas in the beginning. There is
no denying this boy has singing tal-
ent in spades, I would even venture
to say he has the best vocal range I
have heard from a male contestant
on the show, but his nerves almost
prevented him from competing. He
has thankfully overcome these pre-
show jitters and continues to wow
me every week.
James Arthur isn’t a favourite of
mine, but I can see his appeal. He has
a distinct and unique style and there
is so much raw emotion in some of
his performances that it came as a
shock to find him in the bottom two
this week – but more on that later.
I honestly thought that Rylan’s
presence in Nicole’s house was a
joke… apparently not, as he’s still
around acting like the world’s big-
gest diva and not adding much to the
show apart from flashing lights and
club tunes.
The Girls
Well, technically, as this goes to
print, there are no longer any acts
competing from this category. That
being said, I will still talk about them,
because two of the girls have been
my favourites throughout.
Let’s start with Lucy Spraggan. She
auditioned with an original song en-
titled “Last Night”, which was amus-
ing but it wasn’t until she sang an-
other original song – “Tea and Toast”
– during Bootcamp that I became a
real fan. Was she the best singer on
the show? No, but she has real talent
when it comes to writing lyrics and I
hope her short stint on X-Factor was
enough to open some doors for her.
I still can’t listen to “Tea and Toast”
without tearing up…
This week’s elimination of Ella
Henderson has left me reeling. She’s
only 16 years old but, together with
Jahmene Douglas, she had the best
voice this season. Her rendition of
Cher’s “Believe” is nothing short of
genius and if you don’t believe me, I
urge you to watch the video on You-
W
The audience obviously
didn’t ‘Believe’ in Ella
My Top 5 Episodes of the Week
1. 2 Broke Girls, Season 2 Episode 7, “And the Three Boys with Wood”
2. The Big Bang Theory, Season 6 Episode 8, “The 43 Peculiarity”
3. The Good Wife, Season 4 Episode 8, “Here Comes the Judge”
4. Two and a Half Men, Season 10 Episode 8, “Something My Gynecologist Said”
5. New Girl, Season 2 Episode 8, “Parents”
Tube and ﬁnd new meaning in the
song. She has been likened to Adele
and described as the best singer on
the show since Leona Lewis. She was
a true class act, one that didn’t need
any gimmicks to make her perfor-
mances special and memorable.
The Groups
To be honest, I don’t much care for
this category, so this part will be
short. There’s only one act left any-
way – boy group Union J. As much as
it pains me to say it, they’re not bad,
but do we really need another band
like The Wanted and One Direc-
tion? How about rewarding original-
ity for a change?
The Over 28s
Did you know that there has only
been one winner from this catego-
ry and that was all the way back in
2004? Why is that? This year’s con-
testants have been good but apart
from Christopher Maloney, they’ve
all been voted off and I have a feel-
ing Christopher won’t last much
longer. It’s not that he can’t sing,
but he’s quite cheesy and there has
been a lot of controversy surround-
ing him.
This Week
As you may have gathered, James Ar-
thur and Ella Henderson were in the
bottom two. I wish I could be mad at
the judges for not unanimously sav-
ing Ella, but in this situation it was
really tight as Ella’s performance
from the Live Show was in my opin-
ion better, but James was absolutely
amazing as he sung for survival. Ei-
ther way, neither of them should
have been in the bottom two in the
ﬁrst place and this is what frustrates
me about shows like this. This is
meant to be a SINGING competition
so I wish the audience would just
vote for the acts with the best ABIL-
ITY TO SING, and not the guy who
needs 20 scantily clad dancers on
stage to distract from the fact that he
can’t do much more than grind along
to the music. Am I the only one who
thinks this? Maybe not, as X-Factor
managed to lose yet again to Strictly
Come Dancing in the viewers’ rat-
ings last week.
It is my strong belief that the world
needs more singers like Adele, Leona
Lewis and Robbie Williams (before
his stint in rehab) who can not only
sing, but whose songs resonate with
an audience that is not solely com-
posed of teenage girls, because ulti-
mately, those are the singers that will
be remembered.
