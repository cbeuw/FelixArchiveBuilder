Why I didn’t march
Why I did march
The commodification of education
that the introduction of £9000 fees
accelerated drains learning of true
enjoyment. Instead of expanding our
thoughts and horizons, being lost in
our interests, we are merely study-
ing for employment. No longer do
we study for pleasure, but to obtain
a piece of paper that by increasingly
slimmer chances allows us to sit in an
office for the rest of our lives.
Although the name of the demo
demanded ‘Educate. Employ. Em-
power’, I was instead marching for
a truly free education. Not only one
that we do not pay for (both fees
and living) but also where the learn-
ing is liberating and critical in both
content and practice. Not only is
our education system exclusionary
in terms of money and elitism but it
also in this process of wrapping itself
in its ivory tower excludes important
ideas and it fails to look at society in
a critical way.
And funding is intertwined with
this lack of freedom in what we
learn. If we do not fund education
properly it increasingly becomes
influenced and driven by industry.
Education becomes about maxim-
ising profit for multinationals with
no thought for the consequences
instead of working towards a better
society – which education has the
potential to do.
So it would appear that yet another
student march has passed with lit-
tle incident. Aside from mild scuf-
fles at Westminster, yet another ill
timed NUS effort to exercise mass
havoc upon the streets of London
has failed.
Championing the mantra of so-
cialism yet again, it seems to be an
awful case of déjà vu. It seems that
the organisers simply didn’t have
the time to bother thinking up any
original points to mention. It was
just the standard regurgitation of
the fact that Nick Clegg lied, there
are no jobs, and apparently univer-
sities are more expensive than they
used to be.
Rather than marching to Parlia-
ment Square to hear Prime Minis-
ter’s Questions, I’d much prefer to
enjoy them from the comfort of my
personal abode. Notwithstanding
this, I really don’t believe that such
a march will achieve anything. The
national media have drastically re-
duced coverage of such barbaric
events (quite rightly) and the rea-
son for this is simple: no one re-
ally cares. Its about time the likes
of Liam Burns (NUS Tsar) grow up
and stop engaging in such childish
pursuits.
As for me, I think I’ll have another
cup of tea. Beats standing in the
rain...
