The Imperial Immortals opened
their first home game of the season
with a heavy win against the An-
glia Ruskin Rhinos, a newly formed
team in the South Eastern Confer-
ence, following an away win against
the Kings Regents last week (10-6).
A dominant display by the defence
during both matches was key to
the victories with ARU scoring no
points against the Imperial defence;
they only scored off an intercepted
pass thrown on an Imperial offense
drive.
The match opened with Yuh Oc-
ada scoring a touchdown having
started the match at running back
and running impressively.
Having tripped over his size 15
feet, Ron Werlsterherlm carried the
offense’s momentum at the next
drive to stumble into a catch to
score a second touchdown for the
Immortals and secure a two touch-
down lead.
This lead was quickly cut at the
next offensive drive to 8 points as
an ill timed pass was picked off by
the ARU defense to be run in for a
touchdown, their first of the season.
The extra point attempt was charged
down, however sadly our illustrious
captain, Dexter Morgan, celebrated
his return safety with some swagger
far too early and ended up getting
laid out to the embarrassment of
himself and the entire team.
Fortunately Kevin ‘the Man(e)’
Kim redeemed us with a late touch-
down just before the end of the sec-
ond quarter following some poor
defence and some lightning pace
which was reminiscent of our MVP
running back last season, Sungho II.
IC picked up where they left off
after the break with Bob Wartz-
hem picking up a lovely pass from
Yanaux to run in another touch-
down, pulling out a substantial Im-
perial lead.
The Immortals did not let up
however as Emanuel trucked his
way to a touchdown in the corner
with Jordan McDouglas waddling in
vain across the pitch to try to get a
piece of the action.
The final score of the game went
to Imperial, when the offensive line
proved they had better hands than
the wide receivers as the ball was
caught but fumbled by an Imperial
slot back, only to be picked up by
Frederico Sanchez for the first (and
likely only) score by an offensive
lineman this season.
Next week the Immortals face the
reigning national champions, the
Hertfordshire Hurricanes, at home
in what promises to be a bruising
encounter against a team who have
put up a massive 114 points in their
first two games of the season. All
supporters are welcome at what
promises to be a hard fought and
exciting encounter

Falcons do the double
scoring runs in the ﬁrst innings, as Dan
led oﬀ with a base hit, with Sidney and
Kevin “Movember” McDonald both
gettingRBIs. TheImperialdefencethen
kept it tight for the next two innings, as
pitcher Hajime Urata didn’t give up a
single hit. Imperial tacked on another
run in the third, putting us 3-2 up going
into the fourth inning. After a pitching
change by Imperial, UCL grabbed two
runs to take the lead with no outs, but
Imperial’s ﬁelders recovered the situa-
tion to keep UCL’s lead to a minimum
after three and a half innings.
History was made in the bottom of
the fourth innings as right ﬁelder Chris
Carter became the ﬁrst player at the
club to be hit in the head by a pitch. All
were relieved that the batting helmets
actually work, and even more so when
Dan got another base hit, leaving us
with two runners on base. A neat de-
layed steal tied the game up, and Dan
came home on a ground-out to put
Imperial in the lead. UCL now had to
score to make Imperial bat again.
Sidney, now our closing pitcher,
struck out the ﬁrst two batters meaning
the Falcons needed only one out to end
the game. UCL’s next batter got on base
with a walk, then rounded the bases,
only to be caught trying to steal home
by catcher Marcel Ngan for the ﬁnal
out, completing a 5-4 win for Imperial.
The Falcons opened the batting in
the second game and were unlucky to
end the ﬁrst innings with three run-
ners stranded on base, after hits by
Kevin and Rory Thomas. Imperial then
scored early in the second innings, fol-
lowed by a monumental home run by
Sidney in the third. The Falcons’ de-
fence held ﬁrm, helped in no small way
by the performance of “demon pitcher”
Vincent Li (according to the UCL cap-
tain).
After the top of the third innings, the
game was appropriately called oﬀ for
bad light, with UCL graciously accept-
ing a 2-0 defeat. The opposition held
their own, despite being inexperienced
as a club, and both teams will have
learnt from these games. Imperial’s
performance was very promising, and
The Imperial Falcons are back to win-
ning ways after club President Dan
Harris went 3 for 3 and Sidney Louzon
hit a home run to ﬁre Imperial to two
victories against UCL.
Following on from defeats against
ULJS and a minor identity crisis after
Felix thought we were the basketball
team, the Falcons were back at their
nest in Harlington for a double header
against UCL. The Imperial support-
ers were out in force (there were three
horses in the next ﬁeld this time) for the
Falcons’ ﬁrst home game of the season.
The ﬁrst game began with both teams
we hope to build on these victories as
we begin our league campaign against
Oxford this week in the coming weeks.
