FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER
Imperial College Union is hiring
four new staff members whose com-
bined salaries total over £100,000
per year, the budget for which was
approved last year.
The salaries and job descriptions
for these staff members used to be
found online on the Union’s website
(www.imperialcollegeunion.org).
However, it has since been removed
as the positions are being filled.
The Union has already hired some
new staff and is currently inter-
viewing for others. The positions
that will ultimately be filled at the
Union will be: a Representation
Coordinator, Student Development
Manager, Outreach Coordinator
and a Marketing Manager. These
roles are new positions created by
the Union, except for the Repre-
sentations Coordinator which is an
existing position that has become
vacant. The role of Web Developer
is the highest paid of the new roles,
and will have a salary of £28,200 -
£32,100 per year. The other salaries
are shown in the table at the end of
this article.
The exact definition and job de-
scriptions are not precisely given,
although many were described as
“challenging roles”.
The Union’s budget is decided
by the Executive Committee, who
submit it to the Trustee Board for
approval, on a yearly basis. The
budget proposed last year allowed
for the hiring of new members. This
hiring is financed by an increase in
subvention for the College for these
specific roles. The aim of these
hires is “improving the student ex-
perience”, which is a joint endeav-
our by both the College and the
Union; particularly after Imperial’s
nine place drop in the Times Higher
Education (THE) Experience sur-
vey earlier this year, taking Imperial
to 71st place.
The Union hopes that the new
staff members will improve the
student experience in a number
of ways. The Outreach Coordina-
tor role will supposedly widen the
Union’s reach to other campuses,
giving students at other campuses
as best an experience as possible.
The Student Development Manager
will work on improving students’
employability by developing an ac-
creditation scheme and community
volunteering. The Representations
coordinator will aim to increase
the number of responses to Higher
Education Policy, representing stu-
dents on a national level, as well as
increasing the capabilities to pro-
cess and respond to college policies.
The Marketing Manager will work
on further improving the Union’s
communications to students.
The Union have also commented
on further work that will be under-
taken later in the year to “empower
more students in making decision
regarding the distribution of Union
subvention to Clubs, Societies and
Projects.” However, the plans for
this process are not yet finalised.

Make no bones about Imperial Fringe
Bad puns aside Imperial Fringe this
month is all set to put bones under
microscope in an evening of skeletal
debauchery on the Thursday the 29th
of November.
The event, promoted as “Imperial
Fringe: Cutting close to the bone” is
scheduled from 5.30 to 9.00pm and
feature speakers including Professor
Alison McGregor, Dr. Sandra Shefel-
bine and Dr. Richie Abel in a “very
special discussion on bone”.
Attendees will have the chance to
build stem cell scaﬀolds with Pro-
fessor Sarah Rankin of the National
Heartand lung institute at Imperial
and to attempt key hole surgery using
knee arthroscopy simulator.
Dr Alessandra Carriero a research
fellow of the Royal Academy of En-
gineering currently studying the
fracture mechanics of osteogenesis
imperfecta will be exploring brittle
bone disease in mice with the help
of chocolate and biomedical scien-
tist Vin Chauhan of the Department
of Surgery and Cancer is billed to be
showcasing “macabre Victorian bone
specimens” from the Pathology Mu-
Kanchana Niruttan Reporter
seum. Also on hand will be Senior
Lecturer Dr Alex Porter whose work
currently focuses on the visualiza-
tion of interactions between cells and
bio- or nano-materials; she will be
“looking at how we can bond with our
bones” as part of the evening’s pro-
gram.
Event organiser Harriet Martin,
Communications and Development,
said: “With the Imperial Fringe we
really want to tap into the growing
appetite for hands-on, participatory
science-related evening events that
young people are ﬂooding to across
London. Researchers here at Impe-
rial are doing such exciting things,
the Imperial Fringe is a great way to
involve the public with their work and
share their enthusiasm and expertise.”
The event will be held at the College
Main Entrance of the South Kens-
ington campus is open to students,
staﬀ and the general public. While
registration is encouraged (email the
