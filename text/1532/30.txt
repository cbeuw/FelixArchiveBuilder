Black humour at Whitechapel

FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER 31
At its core conceptual art has al-
ways been, and will continue to be,
all about revolution. Whether the
revolution is against injustices com-
mitted around the world, or simply
against current cultural status quo,
you can guarantee that the artist
will be on the front lines, creating
works to make the viewer ask ques-
tions. This quality can be seen in
Duchamp’s upturned urinal entitled
Fountain, which rocked the founda-
tions of the art world; it can be seen
in Picasso’s Guernica, a gigantic
canvas vividly documenting the hor-
rors of war. It can also be seen today
in the work of Maurizio Cattelan,
the notorious Italian satirist whose
works are currently on display at the
Whitechapel Gallery.
Since the mid-90s, Cattelan has
been creating works that have given
him a reputation as the trickster
of the art world. They are created
with a gleeful humour, but more of-
ten than not contain a wicked twist
of darkness. Popes being crushed
by meteorites, Hitler dressed as a
schoolboy, and giant hands giving
the middle finger have all been in-
cluded in his work. The pieces fea-
tured in this exhibition may be on a
smaller scale, but still demonstrate
his sharp wit.
In one of the corners of the room
there is a small diorama of the kitch-
en Cattelan grew up in. The sink is
piled with dirty plates and at the
centre of the room, slumped against
a miniature yellow Formica table, a
squirrel has committed suicide. The
gun lies on the floor. An empty glass
rests on the table. The viewer is left
to make up their mind on why the
squirrel chose to end it all, but the
title of the work Bidibidobidiboo, a
garbled reference to the song that
transforms Cinderella, adds another
edge to a work already dripping with
black humour.
Whilst the squirrel may form a
more personal reflection, the ma-
jority of the works in the room are
attributed with some kind of politi-
cal commentary. Lullaby initially ap-
pears as a giant fabric sack, at the
top of which one can see fragments
of brick poking out. The description
attached to the work explains that
the bag is filled with rubble from the
1993 terrorist attack on Milan’s Pa-
vilion of Contemporary Art, which
left 5 people dead.
At the centre of the room is a rug,
whose design has been based upon
the casing for a wheel of cheese.
The jingoistic sentiments surround-
ing a map of Italy, which may have
seemed quaint when simply used to
advertise cheeses, become reminis-
cent of language used in Mussolini’s
Italy, and brings on a deep sense of
unease.
On the adjacent wall hangs the
sign of the Marxist Italian terrorist
group the Red Brigades but this too
has been subverted. Made up in gar-
ish neon, it has become a Christmas
greeting; the infamous star becomes
the one leading the faithful to Beth-
lehem. This subversion of ideas is
at the heart of Cattelan’s work, and
is one of the key tools in his satiri-
cal arsenal. Some may dismiss it as
shock tactics, but the pieces certain-
ly hit the viewer to the core.
One of the many criticisms that
modern conceptual art faces today
is that it takes itself too seriously.
Those of you who feel fed up in try-
ing to find meaning in Hirst’s pick-
led cows, or despair at the Turner
Prize’s lack of humour, would do well
to come down to the Whitechapel
Gallery. Although the exhibition is
tiny, totalling only eight works, it is
steeped in humour and irony, leav-

statements himself, and the work
becomes a meditation on whether
photography is a genuinely truthful
medium. Does the camera ever lie?
Lines of different lengths are paint-
ed on the walls, along with a bar to
mark where Bochner’s eye level is,
representing the idea of proportion
within art. In the centre of the gal-
lery is Bochner’s seminal Theory of
Painting, in which he explores the
limits placed upon painters using
newspapers and brilliant bright blue
paint. It perfectly portrays Bochner’s
fixation with order and colour, and
it is my personal favourite in the ex-
hibition.
Continuing upstairs we are treated
to a series of ‘Thesaurus Paintings’.
Bochner paints out words upon the
canvas in glorious colours, start-
ing with a word such as ‘Lazy’ be-
fore finding a synonym for it. These
word chains play out like Chinese

whispers, starting with phrases such
as ‘Win’, flowing through into ‘Crush
‘Em’ before ending with ‘Kick Some
Butts’.
In these works the role that the
written word has in art is juxtaposed
against the role of colour. However,
rather than being at odds with one
another, these two features of art
form an unlikely harmony, creating a
series of beautiful paintings.
Bochner’s work is uplifting and, as
a conceptual artist who has bridged
the gap between the art worlds of the
1960s and today, deserves a special
place in history. Contrary to what
the opening work may suggest, this
exhibition is certainly not all Blah,
Blah, Blah.
Mel Bochner is on until 30th Decem-
ber; Maurizio Cattelan is on until 2nd
December. Both at the Whitechapel
Gallery; free entry.
ing the observer smiling all day.
Meanwhile, on the floor below, the
Gallery is staging a retrospective of
the American painter Mel Bochner,
who helped cement New York as the
conceptual art capital of the 1960s
and 70s. His raucous, wildly colour-
ful paintings form a counterpoint to
Cattelans’ on the floor above. Upon
entering the gallery, the first thing
that greets one is a gigantic painting
entitled Blah, Blah, Blah. As the ti-
tle suggests, it consists of the word
‘Blah’ written repeatedly across a
black canvas. The lettering is in a
multitude of colours, which ooze
and drip down the canvas in heavy
smears. This acts as an official intro-
duction into the mind of Bochner,
an artist who is obsessed with col-
our, artistic theory, and the power of
words.
The first rooms of the gallery
document Bochner’s attempts to
represent different artistic theories.
His Theory of Photography consists
of a progression of small cards upon
which quotations from Mao, Zola,
and other great thinkers are written.
However, not all of them are genu-
ine; Bochner created three of the
