Tackling Cystic Fibrosis
Ned Yoxall talkstoDr Jane DaviesonnewadvancesinCFtreatment
n June this year, the Cystic
Fibrosis Gene Therapy Con-
sortium started a ground
breaking new trial looking at
the eﬀects of regularly dosing
suﬀerers with gene therapy. Ned Yox-
all speaks to Dr Jane Davies, the clini-
cal lead investigator in London, to ﬁnd
out more.
Ned Yoxall: Thanks so much for
agreeing to meet! Could you tell me
a little about your background –
how did you end up in cystic ﬁbrosis
(CF) research?
Dr Jane Davies: It’s a bit of a random
story! I went to medical school in
Dundee before coming to London
where I did a series of paediatric clini-
cal jobs with a particular interest in in-
fectious diseases. Before long I found
myself at the Royal Brompton doing a
respiratory and cardiac job, and this
is where I had my ﬁrst contact with
CF patients. The CF lung is full of in-
fection, so I ended up doing an M.D.
looking at how bacteria stick onto the
epithelial cells. After a spell at Great
Ormond Street, I came back to this
job – a combination of a clinical con-
sultant and an academic – where I’ve
been for the last 12 years.
NY: Could you give me a brief dum-
my’s overview of what CF does to the
body?
JD: CF is a genetically inherited dis-
ease, so if a patient has two copies
of the abnormal gene then the cells
lining the organs of their body don’t
handle salt well. The mishandling of
the salt leads to dehydration of the
surface secretions – particularly in
the lungs – so they become dry and
sticky. They then act as a very attrac-
tive place for bugs and viruses enter-
ing the body. This triggers an inﬂam-
matory response, but the infection is
never properly cleared, so you enter a
vicious cycle of chronic infection and
inﬂammation which leads to tissue
damage and other diﬃculties.
NY: So what’s it like to live with CF?
JD: Well I don’t know that ﬁrst hand,
so no matter how well I know my pa-
tients I can never pretend to know
exactly how they feel. It is certainly
very diﬃcult both practically and
psychologically though. Practically,
a huge amount has to be done every
day to manage the disease – up to an
hour a day of physiotherapy to clear
mucous from the lungs, as well as
nebuliser treatments and between ten
and twenty diﬀerent pills to be taken.
That’s when things are going well, and
almost all patients go through epi-
sodes where they need to be in hos-
pital for several weeks at a time. Psy-
chologically, it’s completely relentless
and it’s something that you know will
be with you for the rest of your life and
you know that your life will be consid-
erably shortened – life expectancy is
in the late thirties at the moment.
NY: What is the Gene Therapy Con-
sortium, and what’s it trying to do?
JD: It’s an amalgamation of three indi-
vidual groups – Imperial, Oxford and
Edinburgh – which had previously
been working in competition, but were
brought together by the Cystic Fibro-
sis Trust to work in collaboration. The
aim was to bring a step change in gene
therapy trials where success would be
measured by how patients actually felt
or performed after treatment rather
than by molecular markers in the lab.
NY: Has gene therapy been attempt-
ed in the past?

Our approach
uses synthet-
ic liposome-
based vec-
tors to deliver
DNA
JD: Yes – for lots of diﬀerent diseases.
It’s been really successful at treating
some cancers and immunodeﬁciency
disorders, but gene therapy trials for
CF have never been big enough or
long enough to look for clinical ben-
eﬁts before now.
NY: What makes it so diﬃcult to
achieve?
JD: Lots of gene therapy approaches
use a virus to carry the experimen-
tal gene into the cells. Viruses can be
quite good at this and for some dis-
eases it works really well as one viral
“hit” can be a treatment for life. The
problem with cystic ﬁbrosis is that
you need to treat the lungs, which
constantly renew themselves, so you
can’t easily target a stem cell – you
need to give the treatment repeatedly,
and unfortunately the viruses are tar-
geted by the body’s immune system.
So although you can get excellent gene
transfer the ﬁrst time, by the third or
fourth time, with most viruses at least,
it drops to nothing.
CF necessitates the frequent use of
breathing mask nebulisers

... it’s less ef-
fective than
using viruses,
but can be
used repeat-
edly.
NY: What’s diﬀerent about your ap-
proach now?
JD: We’re not using viruses to carry
genes into the cells. Instead we’re
using synthetic vectors based on li-
posomes which fuse with the fatty cell
wall and allow the new DNA to get
into the nucleus. This process is al-
most certainly less eﬃcient than using
viruses, but you can do it repeatedly.
NY: What’s the best case scenario
after this trial?
JD: The best case scenario would be a
highly signiﬁcant increase in the lung
function of those having undergone
gene therapy. This would be the ﬁrst
evidence that the approach works with
CF and it would then be taken forward
with a collaborating pharmaceutical
partner to develop a treatment.
NY: And the worst?
JD: That it doesn’t work at all. While
this would be disappointing, we do
have a second wave using a diﬀerent
approach, which in fact is a very unu-
sual virus that can be given repeatedly.
A negative trial certainly wouldn’t
mean the end of gene therapy for CF.
NY: What does the trial mean for
people with CF?
JD: Well I’m very careful not to use
the word cure. Even if it is successful,
it will still need to be given repeatedly
and will only treat the lungs, not the
other organs which are aﬀected. It
could, however, be a major move for-
ward and so there is a lot of optimism
about it.
