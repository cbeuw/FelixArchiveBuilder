T a c k h e a d Strange Things LP
The original Tackhead sound was unique:
a gloriously noisy mixture of industrial
style percussion and clever sampling,
pushing technology to its limits to criticise
a society obsessed with technology. More
recent w o r k has shown a diversification
of their style, including elements of dub
and a generally more funky sound.
Strange Things continues this but takes it
too far, giving the album a m u c h more
mainstream dance feel; tracks such as
Wolf In Sheep's Clothing a n d See The
Fire Burning veer too m u c h towards the
easily accessible a n d become simply
unmemorable. There is a general lack of
the strange things that the title promises;
indeed, the title track is a particularly
mundane soul ballad with none of the
creativity that previously made Tackhead
so distinctive. Within this style, however,
some tracks are quite successful. For This
I Sing is a particularly eloquent song o n
the quality of patriotism i n time of war,
an old theme done here i n a fresh
fashion. Whereas i n previous Tackhead
efforts there might be too m u c h of an
emphasis o n including all samples
available o n a particular subject into a
themed song, here the balance between
groove and vocals is just right. Adrian
Sherwood, credited as 'sound designer'
manages to harness the r a w Tackhead
noise so that it manages to harness the
vocals effectively. Political songs were
always Tackhead's speciality: here, the
list of topics were always Tackhead's
speciality: here, the list of topics covered
ranges from sex'n'drugs through to big
business. Dangerous Sex makes the
connection between sex a n d money a n d
this power in a n realistic w a y . Change
recognises that revolution is N O T just
about to happen. A s a whole, this record
lacks excitement a n d originality, almost
as if the group believes that b y making
duller tunes they can get more airplay.
Not so. Only the last track, Positive
Suggestion, has the creative freshness that
is Tackhead's talent; this is what they
should be developing.
Some Fresher in Beit Hall
Ride
Fall EP
After the dissappointing frivolous
blandness of the second E P , Play, Ride
have burst back to the fore to regain
their proud status of the guitar hope for
the decade. T h e first track, Dreams Burn
Down, is their masterpiece remembered
even from their earliest gigs and now still
more magnificent with age. It glistens and
spears with dreamy tears of sheer
pleasure. Within seconds, Taste bounces
in with more hair and energy than ever,
but w h o are they trying to fool with
those false London accents? O v e r o n side
2 (or side 1 o n the C D for all you rich
kids out there), Nowhere features a
chugging harmonica, w h i c h is obvious
really, since t h e song is about a train. N o
sign of the blues here though as Ride
reach their peak of bliss with the softly
screaming Here And Now laced with
feedback and flange. It's wondrous.

Anthrax Persistance of Time LP
The music o n this album is as mechanical
as any pop song while stylistically having
m o v e d towards heavy metal and away
from their previous punkish thrash style.
It's really repetitious and boring. What's
more Anthrax's lyrics have lost their bite.
They don't seem to be trying to see what
the causes of social problems really are
(eg racism) so m u c h as complaining about
the symptoms. The band only concentrate
on the handing d o w n of prejudice over
generations without reference to how the
media stoke it up i n the interests of the
rulers. They once campaigned for the
idea of freedom for everyone but now
they seem to think w e already have it.
Perhaps they no longer live among
ordinary people and are getting their
ideas second-hand from the press.
Musically a n d lyrically, this once-great
thrash band have almost r u n out of ideas,
but not quite. O n e line i n the chorus of
H8RED stands out: 'Different but equal...'
It's a concept worth hanging o n to.

Eat
Psycho Couch 7"
Eat are the sort of band that never quite
got going i n the 80s but lingered o n to
attack thhe 90s. In this context, their
slightly dated sound actually appears
refreshingly novel. O n Psycho Couch they
play a toughened bass, all the more
demanding for the dischords, heightened
by the jaunLing rhythm a n d guitars all
tamed b y the voice of .The whole is a
hauntingly stirring variation which has
the right to b e blasted full power through
octophonic stereo for total appreciation.
For a similar effect, simply tape yourself
to the underside of the corkscrew
rollercoaster. T h e double-A (yet more
indecision) is a more up-tempo rock of
slides a n d screams and slow splendour,
continuing where the last left off. This is
not stuff for the faint hearted. Eat
dramatically show how to submit to
today's dance rhythm trends and blight
them into space.
