Mascotry Bungle
4 * M
A six foot stuffed bear was stolen from
the Rag office on Wednesday. The
owners of the bear, Royal Hollerway and
Bedford New Collage (RHBNC), are
threatening legal action to regain
possession.
The bear had originally been stolen
from RHBNC by City and Guilds (C&G) as
a mascotry stunt to raise money for rag.
This backfired when the collage declared
it to be their property rather than their
union's. The collage's line was that the
removal of the bear was theft and that
they would not pay money to charity to
recover it.
C&G eventually agreed to return the
bear to RHBNC but it was not collected
when they took it to Padington on a
money raising expedition. There Â£100
was collected for rag.
The bear was declared inviolate on
Wednesday morning and placed into the
care of Steve Farrant, Rag Chairman. It
was from his office that the bear was
stolen by the Royal Collage of Science
Union (RCSU). A key had been obtained
from security but when this was found
not to fit, the door was broken down. It
was later repaired by an ex-member of
the RCS after the bear had been
'smuggled' out of the Union building
through the Felix office.
It is not clear what the RCSU intend to
do with the bear although Johnson Hill,
RCS activist, suggested that they would
like to help the RHBNC~8nion raise
money for charity to pay for the bear.
When Steve Farrant was told that the
bear had been taken he replied, 'Has it?
Oh, fair enough.'
Down the
Tube
A man tried to escape the police by
running along the underground line at
South Kensington tube station late on the
night of Saturday 22 September. This
followed a fracas at Southside bar which
involved I.C. students, students from an
American college and three men beleived
to be working as contractors at the
Victoria and Albert Museum.
Rob Northey, Refectories Manager, had
the three workmen thrown out at closing
time, but they stayed in the area causing
aggravation. One of the men returned to
the bar and smashed several windows
with an iron rod.
Security guards called the police, and a
chase ensued, ending at South Kensington
Station where the men were arrested.
The men are now out on bail.
Rob Northey told Felix that the police
were looking for witnesses to identify the
men and added 'the next bastard who has
a punchup at Southside I'm going to turn
the fire hose on.'
Sell Out
Tonight's Fresher's Ball has sold out. All
1200 tickets have been sold and will not
be available at the door.
Cacophony
A complaint about noise levels was
received by the Union on Monday night.
The disco was using lOkW instead of the
normal 3kW. The phonecall, at 8.00pm,
came from a Royal College of Music
residence, the all female Queen
Alexandria Hall, situated at the rear of
the Union Building.
No Rape
A rape alarm was set off by mistake on
Monday night between eight and nine
o'clock. These alarms sound locally and
in the security lodge and are situated in
all of the ladies' toilets, iq the Union
office and in the Deputy President's
office. They are not labeled as rape
alarms but are coloured red.
Paint Slop
Vandals spilled paint on a stairwell in Beit
this week. They used a paintpot that had
been used to prop open a security door
all summer. There are now white
footprints leading up and downstairs from
the second floor in Beit New Hostel.
Chatup
Ben Turner, Union Deputy President, was
overheard chatting up a girl in Beit Quad
on Monday when he left his walkie talkie
on broadcast as he held it between his
legs. He stopped abruptly when Murray
Williamson, Hon Sec (events), told him
what a good conversation he was having.

Genome Project' given by Dr. T. Vickers
