These days, no
rebel needs
â€¢
to be without
a cause.
Read the Observer and y o u ' l l
f i n d plenty.
The e n v i r o n m e n t . The econ-
omy. The H e a l t h Service. H u m a n
rights. Inhuman bureaucracies.
Not to m e n t i o n the Govern-
ment of the day. ( A n d they often
w i s h we wouldn't.)
You'll also find a sense of style,
a sense of h u m o u r and some very
fine w r i t i n g that helps to make
sense of the week's h a p p e n i n g s ,
both at home and abroad.
A perfect example of m i n d over
what r e a l l y matters.
Try it y o u r s e l f t h i s Sunday.

A different set of values. A different kind of paper.
