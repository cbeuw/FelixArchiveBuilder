FINANCE
The fight is on for your money.
H i g h S t r e e t H o o k e r s
Inevitably y o u came away from Freshers'
Fair laiden with leaflets. Somewhere
among that lot are pamphlets from the
high street banks telling y o u how caring
they are and exhorting the m a n y
w'onderous goodies that could be
yours...don't y o u believe it. T h e banks
have not changed overnight, they just
have to try harder to prise your precious
grant cheque from your grubby hands.
It is still possible to obtain a student
account if y o u do not receive a grant or
parental contribution, but a one-off
cheque m a y be needed. Second or third
year students can still obtain student
overdrafts but are not entitled to the free
offers.
Use the table below to compare the
offers available. Don't forget that Midland
and T S B cards c a n be used i n the
NatWest cash-point on the second floor of
the Sherfield Building. Other banks can
be found at South Kensington, Gloucester
Road, High Street Kensington and near
Harrods (it's possible to cut through the
back streets to Harrods v i a a small
passage at one side of Southside).
F E L I X recommendation: Midland's offer
looks good but w e have no information
on h o w easy it is to obtain a loan from
any of the banks—you'll have to speak to
the managers concerned yourselves.
