President
Union Manager
Following the departure of David
Peacock, the quest for a new Union
Manager has taken up most of my time
this summer. A n appointment has been
made, subject to medical clearance. Once
this happens, I'll be able to announce the
appointment.
ULU
Links with the University of London
Union and its constituent members have
been varied so far this year. Whilst there
is probably respect for ICU, there is also
distrust owing to our indiference towards
both ULU and The University. This may
resolve itself as the year progresses.
Welfare
A couple of campaigns are lined up for
the coming months. Unfortunately, the
Union has no Welfare Officer at present.
Assuming no one stood for this post at
yesterday's UGM, can anyone vaguely
interested please contact me ASAP.
Postgraduate Affairs
Ditto above. No officer—buggerall gets
done. The Union needs a PG to dedicate
a few hours a week to run this important
area.
Transport
Can anyone still holding van keys
(including Wendy Morris) please return
them. You won't be allowed to hire any
more vans until this is done.
That's about it. Hope you're having a
good Freshers' Week. See you at the
Freshers' Ball tonight.
Shan.
Hon Sec
Events
The gigs and comedy night this week
have been sell outs. Thanks to BJ,
Graham, Emma and all the Ents crew for
putting it on. Negative thanks to the
fooler who let off the fire alarm on
Monday night.
Freshers' Fair seemed to go OK apart
from the usual chaos at setting up time.
The main problems seemed to be in the
Sherfield Ante-Room and MDH. I hope all
the clubs and societies got the interest
they were hoping for.
There is a large evening being staged
on October 20th in a marquee on the
Queen's Lawn. At the moment Dr & The
Medics are playing plus another named
act and disco. Profits are going to the
Careers Fair. It is the biggest event of the
year with about 2,500 tickets to be sold.
Watch for the publicity. The
Commemoration Ball on October 25th has
sold out, although the band and disco
back at College will be open to all.
Payment on the door at about £3 from
11.00pm.
Returning Officer
All will know of Chris Stapleton's
unfortunate result. The election process
for the post of FELIX Editor (Print Unit
Manager) is now underway and papers
went up on Monday October 1st (here
and at Silwood and St Mary's). No one
has stood as yet. Papers come down on
October 12th. Hustings and voting will be
on October 18th, 22nd and 23rd
respectively if anyone has put their name
up. The Election Committee is myself (as
Returning Officer and Chairman).
The position of student Senator for
Science and Engineering and that of
Senator for Medicine are still vacant. If
you are interested in these University of
London posts please come and see me.
Other ICU Officer's posts coming up
are:
Management School Rep
Two Ordinary Members ACCAFF
Two Ordinary Members ICCAG
Alternative Prospectus Editor
Handbook Editor
Two First Year Reps to Council
If you wish to stand come and see me.
Papers go up on October 15th and come
down on October 26th. Voting will be at
the UGM of November 1st at St Mary's.
Deputy
President
Security
there will be frequent checks of Union
areas. All persons must be carrying an IC
Union card, or be a,reciprocal or
temporary member. Those not
legitimately within the Union building will
be ejected.
Several thefts through the summer have
highlighted the need for tighter
procedures within the Union building.
There has been only one minor theft
recently. The reduction of thefts is largely
the result of greater alertness and
commonsense.
All users of rooms within the Union
Building will be required to arrange for
that room to be securely locked after use,
or face a ban from using Union facilities.
A programme is underway to make
rooms more secure, including changing
doors with glass to solid doors, adding
door and window alarms and tightening
up key access.
Evacuation Procedures
A procedure is being developed in
accordance with new College instructions.
As Monday night's Carnival demonstrated,
the evacuation was effective, but
improvements are being made for
tomorrow's Freshers' Ball.
House
The Refectory Flat, a little known room
in the depths of the Union Building, will
be refurbished. It is likely to be used as a
flat for a member of permanent
management staff.
£7,000 worth of chairs have arrived for
use at dinners in the Dining Hall. Table
tops will be next on the list for an
upgrade.
Trading Outlets
These have got off to very successful
starts for the new academic year.
Continue to use the Union Bar, Snack Bar
and Bookstore, and we shall be able to
continue to run such an efficient and
cheap service for our membership.
The Snack Bar will be operating a
barbecue in Beit Quad tonight (if it's
raining, food will be served in the Snack
Bar itself)—our thanks to Guilds for
supplying charcoal for Tuesday's at short
notice.
Temporary Members
I have taken over this responsibility from
the President for the first period of the
year while he has been dealing with
more important things. There are lots of
temporary members of ICU from many of
the local educational establishments. Mix
with them and encourage them to mix
with you, especially tomorrow night at
the Carnival.
Athletics
The astroturf pitch at Harlington is down
and laid. It has been used and is in good
shape.
University Athletic Union will be
reorganising its divisional structure. Steve
Puttick, Athletic Clubs Committee
Chairman, will be discussing this further
with UAU.
Training
AMEC pic sponsored a place for me to
attend a Management Training Course. I
hope that staff in the office and trading
outlets will notice the difference.
Union Cards and Welcome Packs
Thanks to all the helpers who turned up
to distributed Union cards. After this
week, Union cards may only be obtained
from the Union Office, on Tuesday
afternoons between 2-4pm only. Hope
you all enjoyed the Welcome Packs, and
my thanks to Murray Williamson for
doing most of the organising of these.
