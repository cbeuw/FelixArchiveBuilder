It's a smaller issue than usual, this week,
to allow both us and you to recover from
Freshers Week.
Ents
Both of the gigs sold out as well as the
Comedy night which should set up Ents
for the year to come. It would be nice to
know sometime BJ, who was the band
playing in the UDH? After all, they were
seen by up to 1200 people on the night
and appear on this weeks front cover.
FELIX
It is now the time to consolidate your
views on Imperial and to make a choice
about who and what to be involved with
over this next year. FELIX is of course
the best option available.
The eighty-odd people who signed up
at the FELIX stall will be receiving a note
from us on Monday in their pigeon holes
but all are welcome to come along to the
meeting today at 1 o'clock. We will be
discussing the contents of the next issue
together with the FELIX dinner near the
end of this term. Any contribution is
gratefully received.
FELIX is put together on Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday although the
background work is done all week round.
Come along to help anytime, especially
late on Thursday nights to collate. Here
you can catch up on any of the
unprintable gossip as well as the news of
the day hot off the computer. You will
also be able to indulge in the necking of
a few glasses of wine.

This weeks collators were Toby, Ian,
Stef, and anybody else who turns up. Last
weeks collators were BJ, Simon and all
the other people who were dragged in off
the street. Sorry someone threw away
the sheet which I carefully inscribed with
the names of the late nighters. So you'll
just have to come along and do it all
again! But, both Stef and Sarah deserve
an extra mention for their efforts as does
Toby who made it all through the night
until we finished and then carried on for
most of the rest of the day. Distribution
was aided by Jeremy, Richard and Hal.
