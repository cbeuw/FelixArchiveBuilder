passing light through the
photographed image. By mid-1948 he
had proved that his theory could work
in practise.
At the end of 1948, Gabor moved
to Imperial College in London where
he had been appointed Reader in
Electron Physics. In 1956 he wrote
that the preceding 6-7 years had been
the happiest of his scientific career.
Professor Eric Ash, Rector of
Imperial College, was the first student
Gabor supervised for a PhD. He
wrote of Gabor:
There was no doubt amongst his
students that Gabor should win the
Nobel Prize for something - we
debatedjust what it might be. Nor was
this a symptom of hero worship of
which we were largely innocent. We
could assess the magnitude of the
intellect butfound it harder to discern
the direction.
This is, perhaps, hardly surprising.
In this period he designed an
interference microscope, started
experimental work in plasma
oscillations and did pioneering work
in communication theory.
Throughout his life, Gabor was
insistent that he was an engineer and
inventor, rather than a scientist.
Perhaps is surprising, then, that he did
not always like to work with
engineers:
My experience with engineering
students is that one in two is
completely unfitfor research, and the
other takes a year before he gets
going. For this reason I am taking on
a young physicist; their starting time
is less, but of course there is always
the possibility of getting a dud.
When doing experimental work, he
tended to design an experiment and
then let the research assistants and
students get on with it. This left him
free to go into his office to write.
Communication between Gabor
and the students was sometimes
difficult. He often found it difficult
to get down to the level of the students
when trying to explain some idea.
Eric Ash wrote:
His lecture courses... seemed
memorable but hardly capable of
assimilation - at least, until the
realization dawned that they were not
so much lectures but master classes.
It was necessary to 'know' the subject
before attending these occasions; but
then the experience was enormously
worthwhile - providing both the long
historical view as well as insight in
depth and generality.
In 1956 Gabor went back to
Germany for a visit. Of his trip he
wrote:
This was my first visit to Germany
since 1933, and it was almost a
triumphal entry. I was the guest of
Gottingen University and of the Max
Planck Institute, to whom I gave a
lecture on information theory and
physics. They gave a dinner in my
honour where I sat between Otto
Hahn and Heisenberg, who treated
never taken up since the cathode ray
tube had been shortened by this time.
In 1956, however, the Sunday Times
found out about the research and
printed an article on the subject.
Gabor was concerned for his
reputation and wrote to Allibone, who
was now head of the Associated
Electrical Industries (AEI) research
labs at Aldermaston:
You may have seen in yesterday's
me with more than polite courtesy.
These good Germans, whom nobody
could ever accuse of nazism, are
pathetically keen on making amends
for the others.
Between 1952 and 1958, Gabor
worked on another of his pet projects,
the thin TV tube which could be used
for both monochrome and colour. The
experimental work was, in fact,
successful, but his invention was
Sunday Times a short article 'New TV
set will hang on wall', mentioning
that I am developing such a tube. I
want you to know that I neither
inspired this article nor authorised it.
Presumably it has been released by
the National Research Development
Corporation, perhaps in the hope that
the British valve manufacturers would
prick up their ears. For my part I am
rather concerned about the article, as
it could be read as self-advertisement,
which can only be harmful to me. I
wanted to let you know, in case you
have an opportunity to rectify false
impressions.
Dennis was appointed to a personal
Chair of Applied Electron Physics at
Imperial College in 1958. His
inaugural lecture entitled Electronic
Inventions and their Impact on
Civilization eventually became the
book Inventing the Future.
In 1958 he started working on a
project involving thermo-nuclear
fusion, but illness intervened in 1961
when thrombosis-phlebitis of the legs
sent him to hospital which forced him
to withdraw from the project.
In 1962 the AEI research facility at
Aldermaston closed down. To a
journalist from the Financial Times
he wrote:
In fact your personal worries are
now part of a very sinister
development. Do you know that ICI
are closing down their fundamental
research at Welwyn, and Courtaulds
are also shutting down fundamental
research? I am afraid what is
happening is nothing less than the end
of what can really be called research
in industry in this country. It is a
catastrophic development. When I
came to this country 29 years ago and
noticed the primitive state of
industrial research as compared with
that in Germany, I thought, as most
people did, that it would be different
in a generation, when the people who
had themselves done research when
they were young would have risen to
high management posts. Just the
opposite has happened, it is not the
research man who has replaced the
bluffoldproduction engineer, but the
accountant.
From 1963, when Leith and
Upatnieks applied lasers to
holography, Gabor's place in history
was secured. When in 1971 he won
the Nobel Prize, Upatnieks sent the
first telegram congratulating him, and
in 1972 Leith wrote as part of the
introduction to the Nobel Lecture
printed in the proceedings of the
IEEE:
While Nobel awards are given for
specific achievements, it nonetheless
seems fitting that the recipients of
science's highest award should be
truly intellectual giants in the
broadest sense. On all scores, Dennis
Gabor is worthy of this award.
