Ghent Regatta
Last weekend, a squad of 11 IC
oarsmen competed at Ghent
International Regatta in Belgium and
produced some impressive results.
Vince Roper competed in open light
weight sculls on Saturday—just failing
to make the final in which the former
World Gold Medalist came third. On
Sunday. Vince. competing at Under
23 level took the silver medal less
than a length behind the gold.
The lightweight coxless four, had
a bad draw on Saturday and failed to
make the final, being pipped in their
heat by the silver medal crew. On
Sunday, however, after a storming
first 1000m they led the field and went
on to win the gold over the Scottish
national squad and some notable
European crews.
The heavy weight four finished 6th
on Saturday with a slightly different
crew stroked by super-heavy weight,
Nick Leigh, came 3rd in their heat
behind a World Under 23 gold medal
winning crew.
The coxless pair came 3rd in their
heat which was a little disappointing.
However, these boys were to later
have satisfaction in a spectacle which
brought keen interest from the crowds
as they 'licked' the classy U L pair in
a very enviable performance.

Wicket
2nd XI Cricket vs UCL
Having already qualified for the
knock-out round of the U A U
tournament, today's game was the
match to confirm IC's place at the top
of the league. IC batted first, and
despite an unpleasantly sticky wicket,
managed to put on 80 runs before
lunch. After the break Adrian Lewis
terrorised the UC bowling with an
inspired 48, but the loss of his wicket
heralded a tail end collapse and we
were all out for 142.
Mr Lewis's batting exertions had
left him too shattered to bowl, and cut
IC's attack to three bowlers.
Fortunately, we had the men for the
job in the agile O'Brien and stubborn
consistency of Tim Harmer and Andy
McGee. With eight runs to spare, the
last UC wicket fell and the 2nd XI
was triumphant.
Notts City Regatta
Durham University were found to eat
their words at Nottingham last Sunday
after racing IC in Elite Coxless Fours.
'Don't worry about IC. you beat them
easily yesterday' their coach was
overheard saying before the race in
which (a different IC) were destined
to beat Durham. In a six boat final,
using the infamous wall of water
technique and rating a phenomenal
147 off the start, the Imperial four
found themselves half a length up on
a world championship silver medal
winning crew in the adjacent lane.
(This crew only drew level with a
mere 100m of the race left!) However
the important race was against
Durham who were beaten by 2Vi
lengths—reversing the previous day's
margin.
Other wins were achieved in the
'special race for extremely slow
double sculls' and 'almost' lightning
coxless fours. In the latter, yet
another crew combination was tried
(with Porky Roper rowing at 2) and
the four cruised home to win easily.
The most exciting win of the
weekend, however, was in the Senior
1 fours. Suffering from a weakened
squad after a number of oarsmen were
off games (without notes) the crew
was formed on the day, forcing ICs
coach, Mad-Dog Mason out of
retirement and into the technical seat
of the boat. In a race that was a cliff
hanger throughout its 6:47" duration,
IC won by 4 feet. Bill Mason is 38.
S Q U A S H
Unsquashable
Four IC squash players have proved
to be 'unsquashable' and are now
team champions of London's Fourth
Division.
The fifth team of IC snapped the
Championship from the London
School of Economics virtually on the
'finishing line'. The LSE had started
this squash season as the mighty
favourite but surprisingly dropped
points against teams from the midfield
of the league table, which then
suffered 'whitewash' defeats against
Imperial College.
Four convincing 5-0 victories in
their last four games finally left
Lenssen, Bashir, Midler and Patel
two points clear of the disappointed
LSE team. The four victims were
London Business School, Westfield,
Queen Mary College and St Thomas's
Hospital.
This success is, as team captain
Lewis Lenssen explains, partly the
reward for a 'very good team spirit'.
'When I was on the court, I knew
I was not just playing for myself, but
fighting for the team. We have always
given a lot of moral support to each
other'.
