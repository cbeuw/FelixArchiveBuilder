Eating Rocks
Precious metals, such as Gold or
Platinum, are so expensive that they
are worth extracting from rocks that
contain only tiny amounts of them: 5
grams of Gold per tonne of extracted
rock is not uncommon. Sometimes
this tiny amount of precious material
is easy to extract: metallic gold is
heavier than most rocks so
sophisticated large-scale versions of
panning can be used to separate it (in
a fast-flowing stream of water the
least dense bits get washed away
before the heavier bits). However, in
some precious-metal ores the valuable
bits are much more difficult to
extract. About 30% of all Gold is
found in rocks made from sulphide
minerals and these tend to hold on to
about one third of their Gold content
(even when harsh chemical methods
are used to try to get it out). A
Canadian mining company has
recently proposed a new method that
promises to get almost all the Gold
from sulphide rocks. The method
involves eating the rock.
While eating rock (even the sort
you get with 'Welcome to Blackpool'
written the whole way through it) is
not good for people, there are some
bugs that just love it. One particular
bacterium, Thiobacillus Ferridoxans,
gets its energy by 'burning' the
sulphide ores into sulphates (sulphates
are derived from sulphides by adding
oxygen—thereby releasing lots of
energy). This makes the rock more
soluble and breaks down its
impermeable and dense structure,
making it much easier to extract the
precious components.
The only problem involved results
from the amout of heat produced
during the digestion: the bacteria have
to be kept at 30 ° C but this requires
a large amount of cooling and a large
vat to hold the soup while the bugs
do their work. The extra Gold
recovered makes it worthwhile.
Meanwhile, British biotech-
nologists are working on some other
bugs that work at much higher
temperatures and would therefore
require smaller vats and less cooling.
These might be useful in
circumstances where the expense of
the Canadian bugs would not be
justified. Perhaps this unusual
application of designer-bugs to
geology is a sign that biotechnology
is, at last, starting to do something
useful with all the money that has
gone into it.

MICROSiSCOPE
by Steve Black
Spaghetti Universe
Astronomy's latest fad is the cosmic
string. As is typical for such fads,
cosmic strings are being used to
explain every piece of anomalous
information available to astronomers.
In particular, they have recently been
invoked to explain why the observed
universe is lumpy.
First let's look at the observed
facts. In the last few years
astronomers have concluded that there
are huge holes in space between
clusters of galaxies. This was
unexpected and is, apparently,
difficult to explain given conventional
assumptions about the origin of the
universe and the formation of
galaxies. More recently a group of
astronomers known as the seven
samurai have uncovered some other
related awkward facts about the
motion of some nearby galaxies.
Their observations show that our
neighbouring galaxies are being
pulled by some mysterious object
called the Great Attractor (which is
about 200 million light years away in
the direction of the southern cross,
turn left at Betelgeuse). This attraction
was discovered by subtracting the
expected velocities (resulting from the
attraction due to the known galactic
lumps) from the actual velocities
(measured by red shifts). However,
the quality of this sort of data is
questionable (and often questioned)
since it relies on incomplete galactic
surveys.
Astro-theorists are never slow to
jump on the bandwagon, even if it is
based only on dud observations. So
cosmic strings have been invoked to
explain some of the anomalous facts.
Strings already existed in the minds
of the Alice-in-Wonderland theorists
who like to publish six impossible
things before breakfast, but until these
recent observations they had no facts
that could be usefully explained by
them.
What the strings are is difficult to
comprehend (though I welcome any
attempts by physicists to explain them
more thoroughly on these pages).
Basically, they can be thought of as
one-dimensional defects in the fabric
of space. Space near a string is
distorted in such a way that if you
travelled in a circular path around
one, you would not have travelled a
full 360°. Such odd objects in various
incarnations (including massive
strings which weigh a lot,
superconducting strings and loops of
string) have been invoked to explain
anomalies such as the great attractor
and the inhomogeneous nature of the
universe. They are now even being
used to explain the origins of galaxies
themselves.
Cosmic strings were, according to
the people who champion their
existence, formed in the very early
stages of the Big Bang and have
permeated the universe in a sort of
cosmic Spaghetti ever since. As
clouds of dust and gas flowed past
them in the chaos of the early universe
the clouds were condensed into thin
sheets (this is a result of the distortion
of space around the string). These
sheets were condensed enough to
form into galaxies and clusters of
galaxies whose distribution will
therefore be very uneven. One
interesting (and testable) prediction
from this model is that the distribution
of galaxies is more like a sponge than
a foam (a foam has lots of completely
enclosed bubbles but a sponge has
only one interconnecting but very
complicated hole surrounding a single
piece of matter).
It will be worth waiting for the
observations to sort these ideas out,
but it will be even more fun to see
what the theoreticians can dream up
next: a cosmic reef-knot perhaps?
Editorial:
Science and
the Heretic
In most fields of human endeavour the
heretic is an unwelcome distraction.
Not so in science: there, the heretic
is an absolute necessity. Not that you
would know that by looking at the
way they are treated by the
establishment. For example, when
Rupert Sheldrake's heretical work A
New Science Of Life first appeared,
the editor of Nature suggested that it
should be burnt in public. It may well
be that the book was full of nonsense,
but Sheldrake stuck to the rules of
science and suggested how his ideas
could be tested.
In responding to his challenge,
many biologists will have been forced
to think afresh about the fundamentals
of their subject. This will have kept
them intellectually alert. The more
you close your mind to new ideas, the
more stodgy your own ideas become.
Strict adherence to the conventional
is a sure path towards intellectual
stagnation.
Recently New Scientist opened its
pages to another biological heretic:
Peter Duesberg, who believes that
HIV is not the cause of AIDS. He
believes that the virus is benign and
that AIDS is simply a product of a
sexually degenerate lifestyle.
Duesberg's ideas were ignored by the
establishment when he first published
them, but this only encouraged him
and his supporters in the press.
New Scientist took a more
reasonable approach: they allowed
Duesberg two pages to put forward
his ideas and then gave someone else
the same amount of space to refute
them. Duesberg's opponent admitted
that he had to think again about the
basic evidence when confronted with
the heresy, but the rethink only
reinforced his own beliefs. He won
the argument convincingly.
This is the way all scientific debate
should be conducted. Heretics are a
valuable spur to new thought and if
their ideas are wrong then open public
debate is a better way to prove them
wrong than suppression. Anyway,
sometimes the heretics are right and
conventional science just holds back
progress by ignoring them.
