Ironweed
It is rare these days to see a truly bad
film. Films cost too much money for
anyone to risk making a bad one but
Hector Babenco has managed, against
all odds, to achieve just that. His film
Ironweed runs for two hours fifteen
minutes and seems to last twice as
long.
The film is set in 1938 in the
depressed town of Albany NY where
Francis Phelan (Jack Nicholson) and
his down-and-out friends scrape out
an existence in soup kitchens and
flophouses, doing odd jobs and
drinking liquor. When working as a
gravedigger he visits for the first time
the grave of his son, who died at 13
days when Nicholson accidentally
dropped him on the floor twenty two
years previously. The grave starts him
thinking about his life before the
accident and about the wife and family
he left because he couldn't face the
guilt. From then on the film
chronicles the events of the next day
and half with numerous scenes of life
as a hobo and his belated return home
bearing a 151b turkey as a gift.
The scene of reconciliation is
actually quite moving but it comes too
late in the film (about two hours too
late). By that time you are too bored
to care, having sat through what must
be the most lengthy exposition in
cinema history. Babenco seems so
anxious to show what life was like as
a tramp that he uses most of the
running time just to set the scene. The
boredom and hopelessness of their
lives is conveyed by boring the pants
off the audience.
The film is based on William
Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize winning
novel of the same name (by the way;
what does Ironweed mean?). But the
depth of characterisation possible in
a novel is not easily transferred to the
screen. After half an hour the
characters are established and you
wonder when the plot will arrive. An
hour later you are still wondering, the
intervening time seeming very empty
because the director fails to express
the ideas of the book in filmic terms.
Besides two superstars (Nicholson
and Meryl Streep) the cast boasts Fred
Gwynne (Herman Munster), Tom
Waits and 60s sex symbol Carrol
Baker who is no baby doll any more.
She's no actress any more either
although some of the acting is very
good, managing to produce the
obligatory oscar nomination for Ms
Streep. Unfortunately no amount of
good acting could rescue this film
from the hands of its director.
Ironweed is sad proof of the fact that
even Hollywood's finest can come up
with a 151b turkey every now and
again.

Seventh Son of a
Seventh Son
Iron Maiden
I've always bought Iron Maiden
albums because they use Heavy Metal
as a medium for presenting interesting
musical and lyrical ideas, rather than
simply thrashing out rock cliches to
shouted 'blood and guts' lyrics.
Unfortunately, the latter is a far more
accurate description of their new LP,
7th Son of a 7th Son. Even Derek
Riggs' usually stunning cover
illustrations are lacking, although the
inner-sleeve is terrific. As with their
last album, synths can now be heard
unobtrusively in the mix, along with
sampled choirs on the very long title-
track, the second half of which
contains most of the novelty on the
album. The chorus, however, simply
consists of the title repeated 8 times!
The acoustic guitar ending to The
Prophecy would have come as a
surprise to people if I hadn't spoilt it.
A pity really, as there aren't any other
surprises.

The Innocents
Erasure
Given that Erasure's latest album, The
Innocents, is produced by Stephen
Hague, you might expect it to sound
like the 'every-hit's-the-same'
Petshop Boys. That sound is certainly
in evidence, but Vince Clarke's
catchy formula music is still the
predominant feature. Vince is good
at what he does, and obviously sees
no reason to vary things unduly.
Anyone who liked The Circus will go
for this one too. Unlike some gay
lyricists, Andy Bell has always
written lines which can be identified
with by both gay and straight people,
although he does slip up in Witch in
a Ditch, albeit in German, which has
a catchy folk music tune. The other
non-formula track is 65000, which is
a boring attempt at a house
instrumental, the packaging is very
attractive, the music, consistently
chart-orientated, with numerous
potential singles.

Blind
The Icicle Works
Following last year's If You Want to
Defeat Your Enemy, Sing His Song,
comes Blind. Consistently creative,
yet consistently denied of commercial
success. The Icicle Works continue
to cut their way through the ever
increasing volume of dross that finds
its way onto radio playlists and shops,
in their gritty scouse way. Blind is a
blend of styles as diverse as the
African sounding What Do You Want
Me To Do? through to the Prince
sound-a-like Kiss Off. McNabb still
reminds us though that he's still
listening to his Led Zeppelin and Neil
Young albums, Shit Ceek sounding
particularly like Jimmy Page...
The title track though is without
doubt the finest track on the album.
Following on from Up Here in the
North a single from ...Enemy...,
McNabb sets about telling you in
under five minutes what's wrong with
Britain/the World in 1988. No doubt,
this record will slip by barely noticed,
without the recognition and radio play
it deserves. Support a worthy cause,
the boys are probably still mourning
their team's failed attempt at the FA
Cup (no doubt to be featured on the
next album).

The Wonderstuff
Marquee, 5th March
As usual, The Wonderstuff mix a set
of loud indie/rock with humour and
wit, with the lead singer 'Miles' (!!)
supplying the intersong chatter. What
The Wonderstuff are good at are fast,
short pop songs such as their current
single Give, Give, Give Me More,
More, More that are perfect to jump
about to. They will definitely be
heading for bigger and better things
if the following of fans they have and
the media attention they have been
receiving are anything to-go by.
