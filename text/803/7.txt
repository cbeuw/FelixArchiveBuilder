Jobs for the b
o
y
s
(and the girls!)
During the Summer
vacation many of
the College's
residences are let to
visitors from
outside the College.
The income from
these schemes is
essential if
reasonable rents in
the residences are
to be maintained.
The various
Summer Letting
Schemes offer a
number of jobs for
the vacation period.
These vary from
challenging full-
time managerial
posts to part-time
cleaning work. In
general the work is
well paid and
interesting; free
accommodation is
provided in most
cases.
The schemes fall into two distinct
categories. The Summer Accom-
modation Centre operates in Linstead
Hall and part of Southside, providing
hotel standard bed and breakfast
service for Conferences and other
short stay visitors. This is run under
the auspices of the Conference Office.
The Summer Letting Schemes include
Evelyn Gardens, Hamlet Gardens and
Beit Hall, providing a more basic and
less expensive form of
accommodation. The clientele tends
to be students from other Colleges
staying for fairly long periods. These
schemes are run by the Student
Accommodation Office. For all the
schemes marketing is carried out
centrally, but during the residence
period most of the work of running
and maintaining the scheme is carried
out by students on site.
Summer Accommodation
Centre (SAC)
This is the most prestigious of the four
schemes and has a relatively large
work force necessary to maintain the
very high standards required. The
office and reception desk is in the
foyer of Linstead Hall and is run by
a member of the Conference Office
staff, together with Assistant
Renumeration
Managers, Night Managers,
Cashiers/Receptionists. The reception
desk is manned day and night
throughout the Summer vacation.
Guests are welcomed, registered and
billed on arrival by the reception team
and shown to their rooms by a porter.
Behind the scenes, the cleaners
prepare up to 460 rooms which
involves changing and making beds,
cleaning wash basins and bathrooms
and vacuuming carpets. All this has
to be done in the morning in four
hours. Cleaners work in pairs, under
the supervision of the Housekeeper
and coordinator, serving 24 rooms
and three sets of bathroom facilities
on a staircase. There will also be a
demand for extra cleaners for between
7 and 14 days at the start and for
cleaners to work weekends only.
However accommodation will not be
provided for these two categories.
Evelyn Gardens
This is the largest of the schemes
operated by the Student
Accommodation Office, and is staffed
by four assistant managers and nine
cleaners. All three schemes are
however supervised by a
Coordinator. The assistant managers
run the office, act as receptionists,
maintain booking charts ensuring full
occupancy where possible, collect
rents, operate the accounting system
and supervise the cleaners. The
cleaners clean rooms, change sheets
and act as porters.
Hamlet Gardens
At Hamlet Gardens three assistant
managers and two full time cleaners
run about 50 flats which provide
accommodation for about 200 guests.
The duties are similar to those at
Evelyn Gardens. These flats provide
accommodation of a basic standard.
Beit Hall
Beit Hall is different from the other
schemes in a number of ways. It is
much smaller with only 100 rooms
and the Housekeeper is heavily
involved with the lettings. The Beit
Hall scheme operates with one
assistant manager, one night manager
and three cleaners. The assistant
manager is responsible for raising all
invoices and making sure that guests
pay on time and also acts as an
assistant to the Housekeeper.
Coordinators receive a £ 1 0 per week
responsibility payment in addition to
the above rate. The hours given for
cleaners and coordinators represent a
guaranteed minimum; it is possible
that overtime will sometimes be
available. The hours given for other
staff represent normal hours, but there
will be times when extra hours are
required. Although overtime is not
paid for these extra hours they will
be taken into account when assessing
bonuses.
The Summer Letting Schemes offer
an intersting and rewarding kind of
vacation work. At times the work is
very hard, especially at the beginning
and end of the schemes. Those
working in the management type jobs
need a lot of stamina and patience to
deal with large numbers of guests
while working under considerable
pressure. At the same time most
people who work on the scheme tend
to enjoy themselves as well as gaining
useful work experience. Please note
that in general all staff working in the
schemes must be prepared to cover
any emergencies that arise.
Application forms are available
from the Student Accommodation
Office, 15 Princes Gardens, or Room
170 Sherfield Building.
The Closing date is Friday May 27,
2.30pm.

Lettings Schemes are offered a a discretionary bonus. Wages, hours
