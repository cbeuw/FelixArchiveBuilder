Exhibiting
ourselves
The Imperial College Photographic
Society opens a summer exhibition in
the Consort Gallery, Sherfield
Building on Tuesday May 24 at
7.30pm.
Work on show will include the best
entries in our competition 'Exploring
London', and also a selection of the
best work from society members. The
competition has been sponsored by
Jessops and Paterson, and awards for
the best prints will be presented on
the opening night.
Opening at 7.30pm with cheese and
wine, anyone is welcome, not just
society members. There is no charge,
however, if you do want to come
along please give either Sophie
Jackson (int 4541) or Phil Turner (int
7488) a ring in advance so that we can
cater for the right number of people.
The exhibition will run for four
weeks, and we hope most people will
get a chance to see it this time. It then
transfers to Jessops on New Oxford
Street for two weeks commencing
July 1.

CONCERT BAND
Concert bang
Yes it's that time of year again when
Dramsoc rock the whole of South
Kensington with pyrotechnics, while
the Queen's Tower sways with bell
ringing and the Concert Band plays
Tschaikovski's 1812 Overture, all at
the same time! Those here last year
will remember witnessing this event
while eating their lunches on the
Queen's Lawn in blazing sunshine.
We've booked the sun for Tuesday
May 24 at 1pm this year so take a
break from revision and witness the
main event of the summer.
The remainder of the programme
includes:
Medley from 'Time Out'
Dave Brubeck
Egmont Overture
Beethoven
Fantasy on British Sea Songs
Gordon Langford
Blue Tango
Leroy Anderson
The ICSO was not put off by the
shortness of the Spring term and put
on another ambitious programme-
it was ambitious, I play in the 'cello
section and I can vouch for it!
The programme consisted of:
Suite No 1 from 'Carmen' by Bizet
Reinicke Flute Concerto in D Maj
Peterloo Overture by Malcolm
Arnold
Suite from Star Wars by John
Williams
The first half consisted of the Bizet
and the Reinicke flute concerto. The
wind section had a very tricky task
in the Bizet but had a great
opportunity to put their talents on
show. There are some fast and testing
passages in 'Carmen' but these posed
no problem proving the ability of the
wind section.
We are very lucky in having so
many talented players in ICSO and
Robert Manasse is certainly one of
them. He played the Reinicke with
feeling and apparent ease.
The Peterloo Overture was
commissioned in 1968 to
commemorate the 100th anniversary
of the T U C . It regales the events of
the Peterloo massacre in 1819 in
which 11 people were killed by
cavalry. It was a piece of great
contrast and was my favourite piece
in the programme, a feeling shared by
many others.
The Grand Finale was the suite
from the motion picture Star W a r s -
big tunes, that are well known and
reminiscent of Mars from the Planets,
tender tunes represent Princess Leia.
The only possible criticism of this
may be that the French Horn player
experienced some difficulty in
overcoming nerves whilst playing her
solo. This was a pity as in the
rehearsals she'd played faultlessly.
The thing I admired was that she
continued to complete the solo which
isn't easy if you know of a slight
error.
The finale was a wonderful blaze
of sound that roused the audience and
ensured the concert finished with a
bang.
