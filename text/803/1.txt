Bridge in troubled water
Students are still in the dark over the suspension of the Union Snack
Bar staff and over the position of Deputy President Alan Rose,
following yesterday's AGM. The Union Executive gave a limited
explanation of the crisis, but were not able to disclose full details.
The meeting was opened to an
audience of around 200 students at
1.05pm yesterday in the Union
Concert Hall. It was decided that
awards should be handed out to their
various recipients before the rest of
the business was dealt with.
The first awards to be made were
ICU Social Colours to members of
College staff. Prof D Ewing and
Vernon McClure received their
awards for their work on academic
affairs; Patrick the Beit Quadrangle
Messenger for his work as a
messenger; Adrian Johnson for his
work as Union Bar Manager; Reggie
Blennerhassett for his work as Union
Accountant; and Sashi Patel for his
work in the Wages Office.
After this. Imperial College Union
President Sydney Harbour-Bridge
announced that a new ICU award was
to be given by the ICU Executive for
outstanding service to the Union in
any one year. John Noble and Ian
Morris were awarded an ICU
Outstanding Service Award for their
work on Entertainments; Nigel Baker
for his work on Rag; Chas Brereton
for his work on Academic Affairs;
Mark Harris for his general help
around the Union Office; Rob Kelly
for his work last year; Dr Ken Weale
for his work as ICU Honorary Senior
Treasurer; Chris Martin for his work
on Publications Board and transport;
and Kevin O'Connor for his work on
accommodation.
The final awards to be made at the
meeting were the Union General
Awards (UGA), given by the Union
President for service to the Union
over a sustained period. The first
UGA was awarded to Chas Jackson,
this year's ICU Honorary Secretary,
for his work as last year's ICU
Publicity Officer and Hon Sec.
Quentin Fontana was also given a
UGA for his work as ICU Honorary
Secretary two years ago. Mr Fontana
is no longer a student at Imperial and
was not awarded a U G A by Carl
Burgess, the ICU President two years
ago. Mr Harbour-Bridge said that he
wished to make this retrospective
award because he believed that Mr
Fontana had 'held the student union
together at that time'.
Mr Chas Brereton was awarded the
third UGA for his work on Academic
Affairs this year and in view of the
large sums of money he has raised in
the past three years for Rag.
Mr David Clements was awarded
his UGA for his work with Debating
Society, Science Fiction Society, the
Royal College of Science Union and
work as ICU Social Clubs Committee
Chairman this year.
The penultimate UGA went to
College Secretary Mr John Smith for
the support that he has given Imperial
College Union over the time he has
been at IC and for the amount of
money he has made available to the
Union this year.
The final UGA was awarded to
Union Administrator Mrs Jen Hardy
Smith who Mr Harbour-Bridge
described as the 'most deserving
case'. He said that he believed it was
time to make this award to Mrs Hardy
Smith after the many years service she
had put into the Union.
Following the award ceremony, a
procedural motion was passed which
brought the emergency motions to the
top of the agenda. The first
emergency motion, proposed by
Chris Martin and opposed by the ICU
President, concerned the position of
,the Deputy President, Mr Alan Rose,
who has been relieved of his
management responsibility for the
trading outlets. The motion called on
the Executive to explain why they
took the action regarding Mr Rose
and to present any evidence they had
regarding his alledged 'gross
misconduct'. It also called for an open
debate on the matter. After speeches
from both sides, the motion was
passed.
At the end of several minutes
discussion of whether the action
should be debated, Mr Harbour-
Bridge agreed to answer questions
from the floor.
When Mr Martin asked why the
Deputy President had been relieved
of his responsibilities, the meeting
was again interrupted by several
procedural motions from the floor and
heated discussion on the conduct of
all four sabbaticals.
Mr Harbour-Bridge was asked to
give exact figures for the lost revenue
from the Union Snack Bar. He said
that projected profits of £ 3 5 , 0 0 0
(calculated by assuming that the stock
that had been purchased had been
sold) had 'disappeared', and that the
Snack Bar had actually made a trading
loss of £10,000 during this academic
year. He added that last year's trading
deficit had been £3,000.
Mr Rose stated that he believed that
decisions made by the Executive two
weeks ago had been based on opinions
and not facts. Again the floor asked
for clarification of the accusation of
'gross mismanagement' which had
been levelled against Mr Rose by the
Executive. Not much was
forthcoming.
