DENNIS GABOR: IMPERIAL
ENGINEER AND FATHER OF
HOLOGRAPHY
Dennis Gabor, the
world famous
inventor of
holography, spent
several years
working at Imperial
College.
International
publisher and
holography
enthusiast Sunny
Bains takes a look
at the life of Gabor
and his scientific
philosophy.
Dennis Gabor was born in Hungary
at the turn of the century into a strong
engineering family, although his
father never went to university. From
an early age the combination of
Dennis' own intellect and the
education provided by his father,
Bertalan, gave him more knowledge
of physics and mathematics than his
teachers. He and his two brothers
were given all the books and
laboratory equipment they needed to
excel in both the experimental and
theoretical sides of physics. Through
the family, Dennis learned to speak
good German, French and English,
as well as his native Hungarian.
At school he was often bored by the
work, which he found too easy, and
was unpopular with teachers. He went
on to study mechanical engineering at
the Technical University of Budapest
where he began to settle down until
the third year when he was called up
for military service. Eager to escape
the army, he moved to the Technisher
Hochschule in Berlin to persue an
Electrical Engineering degree:
"Though still at its height at the
time, I could not call the TH Berlin
an ideal institution. There were far
too many students and there was
hardly any contact between students
and teachers. It was a sort of slot
machine into which one had to throw
no end of machine designs, essays and
papers and out came a diploma in the
end. But it certainly made one get
used to hard work! My real education,
and the memory which I cherish most
at that time, was the Physical
Colloquium at the University, every
Tuesday, and the unforgettable
seminar on Statistical Mechanics
which I had under Einstein's guidance
in 1921-22. "
Gabor finished his first degree in
1924 and went on to complete a Dr-
Ing in 1927. He then joined the
Physics Laboratory at Siemens but
when Hitler came to power his
contract was not renewed and he
returned to Hungary where he worked
on the development of a plasma lamp.
In 1934, through Edward Allibone,
who was to become a lifelong friend,
he came to Britain. For 15 years he
worked for the British Thomas
Houston Company. His work at BTH
was, to begin with, largely based on
the development of the plasma lamp.
When this project was eventually
found to be unworkable, he was given
a staff position at the company. With
the onset of the war he found himself
very restricted in his potential fields
of research as he was classed an
'enemy alien' by the British
government. For this reason he was
not allowed to take part in any project
even vaguely involved with defence.
He nevertheless decided to pursue his
own research on the detection of
airplanes using the heat from their
engines and an infrared detecting
screen but, when the military found
out about it, the project was taken
over and he was prevented from
working on it further.
In 1938, after the advent of
television, a worried cinema-chain
owner persuaded Gabor to develop
some way of projecting cinema
pictures in 3-D which he went on to
patent in 1940.
In 1947, Gabor was trying to solve
the problem of aberrations in lenses
in electron microscopy. He had the
idea of recording the phase
information of a beam of light on an
intensity sensitive plate by interfering
it with a reference beam from the
same source, and then replaying it by
