Con Man
back at
Imperial
again
The con man who tries to persuade
students to 'lend" him money, so that
he can 'return to France urgently' is
back in College after six months. The
man poses as an Air France steward
called Benoit and drives a white Fiat
registration number D166 ALP.
Earlier this week an Imperial
student was approached by 'M
Benoit' and asked for money. The
student refused to cooperate, having
read about the con man in FELIX last
December.
Anyone approached by strangers
asking for money should contact the
College Security Office (extension
3371): they are advised not to part
with any money.
