Ayrton Senna's mistake 12 laps from
the flag in last Sunday's Monaco
Grand Prix, when he crashed into a
barrier while holding a 50 second
lead, has given the World
Championship advantage (both
points-wise and psychologically) to
his McLaren team mate Alain Prost.
The most successful driver of all
time, Prost won his 30th Grand Prix
and his 4th Monaco victory in the last
5 years in a rather unsatisfactory
manner. Prost has been out-qualified
in all 3 Grand Prix this season by
Senna quite easily and startline
mistakes lost him the race at the Imola
and should have cost him victory in
Monte Carlo. Yet the fact is that he
leads Senna by 15 points and
McLaren are yet to suffer a
mechanical retirement (Senna was
disqualified in Brazil). This reliability
alone should enable Prost to finish at
least 2nd in every race and as long as
he wins a few more he should be
world champion for the third time.
Unlike football, where the complete
underdogs can beat a much more
expensive team, Formula One is ruled
almost exclusively by the
chequebook. The big spenders at the
moment are Honda, Philip Morris
(Marlboro) and R J Reynolds
(Camel). I say almost exclusively
because Lotus are again proving that
in the modern era they are the big
losers. Since the death of founder
Colin Chapman in 1982 Lotus have
gone downhill in a big way and much
of the credit for this must go to team
manager Pete Warr. His latest
masterstroke was signing world
champion Nelson Piquet, the arrogant
Brazilian who has resorted to making
cheap jibes about other drivers private
lives in Playboy rather than
concentrate on his (very slow)
driving. He would do Fl a great
favour if he packed up, shut up and
went home.
BOOKS-
The Grey Horse
R A MacAvoy
This simple tale of simple Irish folk
turned out to be a little too simple for
my liking. The plot itself is very
straightforward, a man, Rory
MacEever, wants to win the heart of,
and then marry a young girl, Mary
Stanton. Not really the kind of thing
you might expect of a popular writer
whose works are generally found
amongst the science fiction or fantasy
section of bookshops. Well there is
a little more to the story. Mary is a
nationalist, the kind of radical
protagonist which the South West
corner of Ireland might well
accommodate. The real kick comes
from Rory though. He is a horse (yes
a grey one), or to be more exact, a
horse fairy who turns into a man on
occasion and gallops around the
hillsides the rest of the time.
The fairly subtle sub-plot of father
and estranged son being reunited is
not only a touch obvious but very
cliched. In fact the only surprise in
the book is how quickly the characters
come to accept a magical creature in
their midst. Perhaps the Irish are like
that—I don't know.
Despite these complications and
substructures, the events develop
rather too slowly, perhaps an attempt
by the author to recreate the
timelessness of the country, which is
usually claimed by the Irish Tourist
Board. The frequent Gaelic references
I found confusing and distracting and
did little for the authenticity of the
story, a shame since this is no doubt
the reason for their inclusion.
R A MacAgoy has received several
awards and nominations for her
writing, and I can only assume that
she has done better in the past. If you
like horses and simple tales though,
you might like this book.
The Grey Horse is published today
by Bantam, and is £2.95.

Cookery Club
A Summer festival
1 always look forward to the Summer
because strawberries are available in
abundance to make my favourite
mousse.
Strawberry Mousse
Ingredients:
500g fresh strawberries
50g (2oz) caster sugar
4 tblsp water
V2 pint double cream
2 egg whites
Method:
Puree fruit
Dissolve gelatine into water
Pour gelatine into puree
Blend together
Pour in whisked cream
Whisk the eggs and blend into the
mixture
Set the mousse in the freezer
compartment
The mousse takes about 2 hours to
set. Take care not to freeze it solid.
Move it into the refridgerator as soon
as it has set.
If you want to make this mousse it
is well worth taking the trouble to
borrow a blender. You will love the
tangy, slightly sweet, but creamy
result that this recipe produces. You
might like to try substituting
raspberries for strawberries.
Former junior Swiss
wrestling champion quits
the Dorchester
The world of food is as much about
the people who cook in it as it is about
the food itself.
Anton Mossiman retired recently
from the Dorchester Hotel after
heading a posse of 80 chefs for many
years. He has opened a restaurant off
Belgrave Square where he hopes to
carry on pleasing the palate.
He is regarded by many as the
finest chef in England since the great
Escofier. Anton has helped to
promote bread and butter pudding
from the status of mere stodge to that
of a regal pudding. I hope to include
his recipe for this classic pud in a
future issue of FELIX.
Greece & Cyprus
The City of Thessaloniki
L Patsiolou and K Yamalidou of
Chem Eng were kind enough to give
tips on areas of the city where the
good Greek tavernas are to be found.
1) The castle
The areas around the ancient Roman
castle and the village within it offer
an excellent assortment of tavernas
where Greek food must be eaten. If
you have any fears of Greek food this
would be the time to forget them and
eat like a glutton for you will have a
difficult time finding better value food
anywhere else in Europe. You might
be lucky enough to find a taverna that
offers a spectacular view of the port
city from a vantage point in the castle.
2) The Olympus-Naoussa area (city
centre)
Rogottis—This establishment is
famous amongst the locals for its juicy
'soutzoukakia'. The girls insist that
this local delicacy cannot be missed
for the world.
The city outskirts
3) The locality of Krini-Kalamaria
Close to Krini is the expensive
luxurious taverna of Krikelas. A meal
here would be recommended to those
who are prepared to spend between
£10-15 per head inclusive of service
and wine.
4) The locality of Nea Mihaniona
and Epanomi
5) The village of Panorama
Here the tavernas offer the much
loved 'trigono' which must be had as
dessert with any meal you might try.
All the areas that I have mentioned
can be reached by bus from the city
centre. It would be a good idea to try
Greek seafood dishes if you go to a
taverna in an area near the sea, but
further inland the 'Souvlaki' (kebab)
meat preparations might be prefered.
The Island of Corfu
It might be sensible to avoid Corfu in
the peak of summer, but if you
venture this far you certainly must not
miss a meal at Georgo's taverna in
Messongi. The Moussaka, the
Barbouni (red mullet), the
Massoroonatha do Foumou (oven
baked macaroni cheese) are the
outstanding dishes to be tried. A meal
here will cost a paltry £ 1 . 5 0 .
Dr Toumazou warns that Cyprus
will be more expensive than the Greek
islands but that is never any reason
to miss out on good food.
The places to look out for are:
Taverna Aphrodite, Limassol—The
Kleftico (leg of lamb) and the
'Aphelia' (chunks of meat marinated
in wine) are two masterpieces and
should cost about £3 per head.
Taverna Salamis, Ayia Napa—The
Souvlaki and the Galamari (squid)
should be tried.
We have come far since leaving the
leafy lanes of London but before our
gastronomic itinerary moves
westward I will be giving food tips
from Athens and the Aegean islands.
I am indebted to those who provided
the info that made this article possible.
Bye for now,
Yishu.
