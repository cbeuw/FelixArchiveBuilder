150 beds lost in Lexham
continued from front page
A procedural motion tabled by
David Clements that the meeting
move on to the elections was defeated.
A second procedural motion, calling
on the Executive to explain their
actions immediately, rather than in a
written statement in FELIX, was
tabled and passed.
Royal School of Mines Union
President Mr Geoff Parsons spoke on
behalf of the ICU Executive. He
explained that the decisions
concerning Mr Rose and the Bar and
Snack Bar staff had been taken after
12-13 hours of meetings and stressed
that they had not been made lightly.
He stated that an emergency
Executive meeting had taken place
2l
h weeks ago, at which all the
Executive officers, except Alan Rose,
had been present. The meeting was
also attended by the Union Bar
licencees, Dr Robert Schroter and
Mrs Jen Hardy-Smith, Dave Peacock,
the Union Manager, and by Chris
Martin and Nigel Baker as observers.
A second meeting took place where
Mr Rose was present in order to
answer accusations. It was at a third
meeting that it was decided to relieve
Mr Rose of his duties concerning the
Union trading outlets. This decision
had been made unanimously, said Mr
Parsons. He went on to say that the
Executive felt that Mr Rose had not
fulfilled his responsibility and that he
had been obstructive when working
with the Union Bar licencees. He said
that he felt that all the decisions which
had been made in the last few weeks
had been in the best interests of all
students.
Mr Rose said that in his opinion
'certain facts' had been distorted by
the Union President. He also believed
that the Union had 'taken on too much
too soon' as far as the outlets were
concerned.
Several more questions were tabled
from the floor until a vote was taken
at 2.50pm as to whether any more
discussion should take place on the
issue. The meeting decided after a
vote that it did not wish to carry on
the debate and the agenda went back
to the minutes and reports.
At this point, Philip Drew,
President of St Mary's Medical
School Union, stood up to speak. He
said that he was appalled at how badly
the meeting had been conducted and
that he would suspend all negotiations
between his and IC Union until ICU
'put its house in order'. He then lead
his fellow St Mary's students from the
meeting.
Later he told FELIX that this had
not been just a spontaneous reaction,
but that he had for some weeks been
upset at the way his union was being
treated. He condemned the fact that
the A G M achieved so little and said
he felt the chairing of the meeting was
poor. St Mary's meetings were much
more civilised and ordered, he said,
and they got much more done.
The meeting finally decided to
consider the annual reports. A motion
was passed mandating the FELIX
Editor to write an annual report. Such
a motion is not technically within the
remit of a UGM. The by-laws state
that 'the officers of the Union shall
be responsible for carrying out the
policy of the Union as determined by
a General Meeting'. The FELIX
Editor is not classed as a Union
Officer in these by-laws. The UGM
may choose to dismiss a FELIX
Editor but no other practical power
over the FELIX Editor. But by this
time nobody was paying too much
attention to procedure.
There was another procedural
motion, calling for the elections to be
run, which was passed. All elections
took place with only the GUC
delegates elections being referred
back to the next Union General
Meeting. Quorum was then called
during a motion on Human Rights
Week and the meeting was closed at
3.30pm.
Professor Alan Cowley, currently of
the University of Austin in Texas, is
to take the Sir Edward Frankland
chair of Inorganic Chemistry at
Imperial. He will succeed Sir
Geoffrey Wilkinson, FRS and Nobel
Laureate, who has been at Imperial
for 32 years.
The appointment comes at a time
when the Chemistry Department,
under its new head, Professor John
Albery, has plans to widen its
activities. There is to be close
collaboration between the Department
and the new Interdisciplinary
Research Centre in Semiconductor
Growth, Characterisation and
Processing. Professor Cowley's
expertise in designing molecules for
laying down very thin films on
semiconductors will be particularly
Imperial College students are likely
to lose the use of the Lexham Gardens
head tenancies from the end of this
term, it was revealed today by IC
Union President Sydney
Harbour-Bridge.
The 150 beds have been at risk
since an inspection by the Local
Authority found various faults in the
buildings. These faults included
problems with roofing, drains and
gutters as well as certain breaches of
fire regulations. The Local Authority
served inspection notices on the
landlord which required him to carry
out work on the properties to bring
them up to standard.
Although the Local Authority does
have some discretion on how long
they can allow landlords to carry out
maintenance work in general, this
does not apply where fire regulations
have been breached. In any case,
College Secretary John Smith told
FELIX, it would be irresponsible to
have students living in the building if
this work was not carried out.
It is thought that the investment that
the landlord would have to make in
order to bring the accommodation up
to an acceptable level for students
would be so high that he would be
more likely to want to sell the
buildings outright or redevelop them
as luxury flats.
useful in this respect.
Alan Cowley was born in
Manchester on 29 January 1934. He
received a BSc -with Honours in
Chemistry from Manchester
University, where he also earned an
MSc in 1956 and a PhD in 1958. For
the next two years he worked at the
University of Florida, before taking
the post of Technical Officer with the
Exploratory Group of Imperial
Chemical Industries (Billingham
Division). In April 1962 he started as
Assistant Professor of Chemistry at
the University of Texas, and in 1984
he was appointed George W Watt
Centennial Professor of Chemistry.
Professor Cowley was elected a
Fellow of the Royal Society in March
this year.
The Landlord, Mr Dangoor, was
unavailable for comment, however it
appears that he has actually offered
to sell the houses to College. It seems
unlikely, however, that the College
Residence Account could afford to
compete in price with developers.
Loretta O'Callaghan,
Accommodation Officer, has
expressed her regret at the loss of the
places, but said that there were one
or two alternative places that they
were looking into.
Sydney Harbour-Bridge was also
saddened by the news, especially in
light of the fact that they had already
lost 50 places in Hamlet Gardens and
another 22 in Earls Court Square. It
would make life more difficult for
those who had already been accepted
to live there next year, he said, though
there was no suggestion that these
people would not get places
somewhere.
The houses had been known to be
under threat for some time, but it was
only in the last couple of weeks that
Malcolm Aldridge of Finance
Section, who had been negotiating
with the landlord, decided that there
was little prospect of a settlement
which would mean College keeping
the houses.
The present lease for the buildings
runs out at the end of June.
Passed the post
Gill Knowles has been returned
unopposed as next year's Women's
Officer at this year's Annual General
Meeting. Several other elections took
place at the meeting. Chris Stapleton
was returned as ICU Housing Officer,
Martyn Peck as ICU Publicity
Officer, Jan Graham as Haldane
Record Buyer, Andrew Thompson as
FELIX Business Manager and David
Clements as Postgraduate Affairs
Officer. An election for House
Committee Chairman was avoided
when Sydney Harbour-Bridge (name
changed in aid of Comic Relief)
decided to stand down, leaving
Andrew Thompson unopposed for the
post. Sumeet Ghaie and Neil
Motteram will be next year's House
Committee Ordinary Members.
The only election to take place at
the meeting was that for Haldane
Book Buyer. Andrew Meredith won
by a small majority.
