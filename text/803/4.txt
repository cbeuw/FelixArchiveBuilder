Money for
old rubbish
An ecologically-minded student is
being sought for a summer research
project into waste paper recycling,
being set up by Steve Easterbrook and
Dr Richard Murphy. The project is
to investigate how to organise
collection of paper from all over
College and will run for eight weeks
over the summer vacation. The
project will be funded by UK2000,
the project headed by Richard
Branson, and supported by Friends of
the Earth, to provide cash for
community efforts to improve the
environment. IC Union have also
offered to provide some funding and
office space.
There are a number of problems
associated with collecting paper for
recycling which will need to be
investigated in this project. One of the
most obvious, which has dogged
previous attempts is where to store the
paper, and how the fire risk can be
overcome. It is hoped that a deal can
be negotiated with a waste paper
dealer to provide fire-proofing as
necessary. Other problems include
how best to sort the paper as certain
grades of paper are worth more than
others, and how to encourage people
to collect their waste paper.
The results of the project will be
presented in a written report which
can then be circulated to other
colleges and institutions to encourage
them to set up their own paper
recycling schemes.
Anyone interested in earning some
money over the summer while
remaining ideologically sound should
contact either Dr Richard Murphy
(Dept of Pure & Applied Biology) or
Steve Easterbrook (Dept of
Computing).

Letter from
St Mary's
Life is very sombre at the moment.
There is little fun to be had in the pre-
clinical years. The project of the grim
reaper has scared many a first year
into frantic work,-and reminded the
second years of lost time. Talk is full
of hints dropped by the teaching staff
in tutorials and lectures.
This is the time the 'spotter kings'
(or queens) make a mark. Carefully
picking their way through the
minefield of summer exams, they
examine each topic for the probability
of appearing in the paper. Success can
be stunning, for example last year in
one paper (and I stress only one
paper) an individual spotted 20 out of
21 questions. Unfortunately such a
dazzling performance occurs only
once.
Probably the funniest sight of the
day is the race to the library after the
first lecture! Unless you are at the
front your chances of a desk are
limited. As one walks into the library
the atmosphere of concentration is
immediately apparent. One can

visualise the tiny cogs whirring as fact
upon fact is digested with a sense of
purpose usually reserved for
international money dealers.
It is now that the individual who has
ignored the tutorials throughout the
year starts appearing and asking for
extra work. This is partly to improve
their style and accuracy, but is also
(and probably more importantly) to
see if the tutor will drop any half-hint
that can be acted upon. Such rumours
spread around with the speed of a well
fanned bush fire, so that by the end
of this week almost every subject
individual will have been spotted!
Mounds and mounds of paper have
been destroyed and countless pens
discarded. One individual used a
whole pad (200 sheets) of A4 in a
week (using both sides and no waste).
This feat gains even more credibility
when one remembers that there are
few if any formulae or calculations
required, as most of the work is in
essay form.
The ironic thing is that most of this
work is of no practical use for the
future, simply a way to pass the 1st
or 2nd MB. To work so hard and
amass so much information—each
subject doubles the vocabulary, just
to pass a single set of exams and then
forget most of it strikes me as one of
the biggest wastes of time ever
devised. Those poeple who do well
in 2nd MB do not necessarily make
good doctors, so what is the benefit
of it all?
