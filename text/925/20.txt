Soup Run
Every Thursday night for the past
few years, students from Imperial
and Kings Colleges have delivered
soup, biscuits, tea and cheese
sandwiches to homeless people.
Why do we do this? Surely no lazy
tramp deserves our sympathy?
Well the answer is YES they do,
since if you ever talk to these people
you soon realise that they are not
lazy or dropouts. They have just
had a lot of bad luck. Many of the
homeless come to London in the
expectation of finding a job. Last
autumn, I spoke to a man who had
arrived from Merseyside but was
living in a tent at Lincolns Inn
Fields (near The Strand). He was
an electrician with a family to
support, but with no address for
post he had no chance of finding
employment. And with no job he
cannot afford down payments
(typically £400) required to move
into a flat.
There are hostels and housing
projects in London, but many of the
residents at Lincolns Inn have
moved out of these. As one person
commented. 'We are safer in the
park because everybody knows
everybody else. Nothing gets
nicked like it does in the hostels.'
Despite everything that has
happened to them, most remain
optimistic and determined. With a
little help most would help
themselves and manage to find
L.A. Story
This week Film Soc is showing L A
Story, starring Steve Martin. It's an
hilarious film about a prime-time
weatherman who one day breaks
down by a motorway sign, which
tells him his life is going to change!
Sure enough, he falls in love with
an English reporter (his real-life
wife aka Victoria Tennant) and also
meets a beautiful young woman,
who feels like a break from her
usual boyfriend. He goes on a
holiday with the young beauty at a
discreet hotel; but as luck would

homeless people are a tremendous
potential which is lost through the
inadequacies of the system.
We cannot solve the long term
problems. We only aim to make
their life a little better with a hot

also with another man.
The story of their rocky road to
true love makes for hilarious
viewing, together with Martin's
novel ideas on presenting the
weather. You can see the film on
Thursday 13th February at 7.30pm
in Mech Eng 220. Entry is 80p for
members and £ 1 . 8 0 for everyone
else. And if you don't know by now
membership is £3.50, for which
you get to see a film free.

if you are interested in helping out,
come alone to one of our soup runs.
We leave from Weeks Hall at
9.15pm every Thursdays.

Basketball
IC Men's basketball team pushed
their U A U run to 4-0 by knocking
East Anglia out of the 1992
Championship last Wednesday
(24th Jan). At St Mary's Wilson
House Gym, coach Sacha Cole
spurred IC to a 93-59 win: their
biggest victory this season, despite
only having seven players on the
bench.
Imperial led by a massive 56-26
at half time, but looked
uncomfortable for much of the
second period. The loss of Haddon
and Kountouris on 5 fouls put great
pressure on the rest of the team -
for whom there could be no rest on
the substitutes' bench. David
Syriani managed to last out the final
13 minutes carrying 4 fouls, helping
to keep IC's presence to at least 5
players.
With leading rebounders Michalis
Senis and Nick Braley unavailable,
Imperial were fortunate to be
rejoined by Aydin Alatin. His 30
point contribution was a significant
factor in securing IC's control of the
game. Angelos Kountouris backed
up Alatin with 18 points, and Mike
Reeves turned in a valuable 14
points.
Imperial faced Brunei last
Saturday (1st Feb) at Brixton Sports
Centre, in the next round of the
U A U tournament. Hopefully, the
outcome can be published in the
Results Table this week.
After the dismal attempt to organise
a 11-a-side football league last year,
we are now attempting to put
together a 5-a-side contest. At the
moment the OSC is generally taking
care of all the details, but the
competition is open to all clubs and
societies of Imperial College.
(Please note however, since most of
the games will be taking place on
Wednesday afternoons, clubs which
have events planned during this
time may be advised not to enter!)
So if you (or your club/society)
is interested in participating, please
drop me a little note saying so. This
may be done either through the
Felix pigeon holes, or by e-mail to
khs@doc. More details will be
published once the response is
known, so please hurry. Any one
club/society is permitted to enter a
maximum of two teams.
