7 February 1992 Felix 925 Travel
The cold Welsh wind swept icily
through Ryans's hair as he soared
above the hard, unforgiving earth
and rock of the winding mountain
track. Branches of countless pines
brushed past on either side,
reaching out—grasping—but never
catching him. 25, 30, 35mph—he
was unstoppable.
Suddenly Ryan knew that he was
going to crash. His cucumber-sharp
mind took in the rapid approach of
the moist, grassy bank, the trees,
the impending doom...
Ryan had fallen prey to one of the
most fearsome of all earthly
experiences—an IC Cycling Club
Mountain Biking Weekend.
Nine swarthy club members left
the noisy midday throb of Southside
Bar, destination Snowdonia, with a
lump in their throats and a stirring
in their trousers at the prospect of
the adventure ahead.
After six long, painful hours in
the Union minibus, hills hove into
view. Appreciation was voiced in
the form of ripples of excited
flatulence which resonated along the
lush Welsh valleys.
Ultimately the group reached
Bangor Youth Hostel, and a short
while later, a pub in the centre of
the city. By now it was 9pm, and
we weren't quite prepared for the
sight that greeted us. Considering
it was Friday night. Bangor was
deafeningly quiet.
It didn't take very long (about 3'/2
minutes) for us to collectively agree
that Bangor was shit. This feeling
remained for the rest of the
weekend.
Something else therefore had to
be done to provide entertainment,
and the provision came on Saturday
morning in the form of
mountainbikes that were hired from
an enterprising youth in Betsw-y-
Coed for a reasonable sum. He also
gave us some hand-drawn maps of
the area, which proved to be about
as much use as a cat in a condom
factory.
The Chairman of the Club, Craig
Wilson, then tried in vain to kill us
all with the first hill which, although
tarmac-ed. must have been at least
a 1:3 for over a mile. At the top he
then admitted that it was actually the
wrong road anyway but the rest of
the party hit him until he agreed that
it WAS the right road and if we only
go...errr...left. no right at these
crossroads we'll be near the right
track again.
Not many of us fully recovered
from this first climb, but despite the
blood gushing audibly through the
veins in our ears and our throats
hurting from inhaling the cold, dry
air we were forced to continue on
our journey by a large Dobermann
which had come bounding
anarchically up the hill after us. its
long tongue throwing gobs of foamy
saliva as it ran. It didn't appear to
belong to anyone (or at least no one
appeared to want it) which only
added to its threatening charm.
The laws of science dictate that
what goes up must come down, and
tired though we were, we knew
this. The exhilaration of throwing
your aching corpse over the top of
a mountain, starting the headlong
rush to regain some kinetic energy,
can only be described as, well,
indescribable. As we gained speed
without the usual need for physical
exertion, we realised why we enjoy
second. Needless to say the
Doberman didn't turn up when it
was most needed to corroborate the
story.
The Forestry Commission have
yet to send Ryan the bill for the
damage he caused to the grassy
bank, which is under sedation in a
remote hospital in the Lake District.
A small family of squirrels and
three moles have put their names
forward as key witnesses to the
incident. The rest of the group
found this accident amusing, and it
gave much conversation for the
coming evening in Bangor. Even
Cycling in Wales
cycling. Our speeds got higher and
higher as the inevitable competition
began to see who could reach the
bottom of the valley first.
Halfway down Ben was leading,
with 37mph on the clock. For a
while, Ryan was 'not far behind'.
And when he was just 'behind'. A
corner had caught him unawares,
and the skid marks in the
photographs indicate his
approximate angle of approach.
Eventually the carnage was cleared
away, and the blood licked up by
the big mad bastard dog which was
still following us around. The rest,
as they say, is history.
Ryan's front wheel was buckled
beyond repair, but, being true IC
students, we re-engineered it
(jumped up and down on it with
highly scientific precision) until it
would turn in the forks again.
Others amused themselves by
throwing sticks for the dog. Instead
of returning the stick to the thrower,
the mindless beast would chase the
stick and chew the fuck out of it in
the most endearing manner. To our
amazement Ryan cycled another
five miles on the knackered wheel,
only slightly slower than we went,
which says something doubtful
about his mind's response to the
crash. The wheel cost him £ 1 0
when we returned to the bike hire
place, because the bloke didn't
really believe Ryan's story that a
big black Dobermann that had
followed us at 20mph for the last 15
miles had distracted him for a split
Ryan himself saw the funny side of
it in the end.
On Saturday we ventured back
into Bangor city centre, but this
time to the University Union. A
rigorous check of Union cards was
made at the door. Two meaty
bouncers stood together glaring at
new arrivals while more lurked in
the background with malicious
intent. By the time we had all
managed to get into 'Joes' there
were exactly 11 people in the bar,
and 9 of them were IC students.
Shit. What a groovy place to be at
University. Made us really feel at
home...Predictably we got sick of
that and left soon.
Sunday, we buggered off into the
mountains again, but the enthusiasm
started to waver as people began to
invent stories about injuries, vital
interview preparation and itchy
shorts etc. So in the afternoon there
was just four of us in the mountains,
and arguably the fittest four, it
might be added. We thrashed
ourselves silly for another couple of
hours until the whip broke, so we
did a bit more cycling. This was
well worth it, and the rest of the
group kept saying afterwards 'Oh
I'd have come if I'd known you
were only going to be another
hour.' Yeah! Pull the other one...
We returned to London at
9.30pm into the steamy throng of
Southside Bar, our limbs stronger,
our hearts bolder, our spirits high,
and our clothes a-covered in Welsh
shite.
