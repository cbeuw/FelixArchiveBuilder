Travel Felix 925 7 February 1992
In Brazil, there are eight million
children on the streets, homeless,
hungry and without a family. A n
estimated 32 million children are in
the state's care—many are better off
on the streets. In the last four years
over seven thousand kids have been
shot by death squads.
How many holiday brochures
quote those statistics? It doesn't
sound much like a place for a
holiday, but how many tourists go
to Rio De Janiero each year? H o w
man) see past the golden beaches
and casinos? H o w many care?
This sounds more like a rant
about Third World problems than
a travel article, but the point I'm
trying to make is that it's wrong to
exciting.. .until I was introduced to
A i r France meals. The slice of pink
latex was eventually identified as
s m o k e d salmon and not a
misformed condom. Roll on drinks"
trolley.. .quickly.
There was an inflight movie 'for :
our entertainment'. The computer
terminal giving a listing of altitude,
speed, and external temperature
was far more interesting though.
Time for some sleep. I thought.
We landed in Rio at 4am, it was-
dark—surprisingly enough—but the
city lights stretching along the coast
were quite a sight. For a few
moments we forgot what was
ahead...customs. Rio's customs are
renowned for being corrupt, this
night, two people were murdered.
Oh well, who needs sleep—I
wanted to see Rio anyhow.
So. we were driven around the
sights of Rio. This brings me to
'Experience 123". The highway
code is slightly different in Brazil—
it takes some getting used to.
a) They drive on the right...and
the left...in fact anywhere they can.
As a rule a space wide enough for
a car, with no oncoming traffic, is
a lane. If the space is between two
slower moving vehicles, it's a fast
lane.
b) Traffic lights are for ornamental
effect only. If you stop in R i o .
you'll probably get mugged, or
cause an accident, so one does.
The Warboys Orphanage Project
The follies and
fun of Brazil
Simon Burton
learned more
about Brazil
than that which
you can find in
a tourist
brochure...
The Roman Catholic cathedral in Brasilia
tour a country without returning
something to that country. Last
summer a team of fourteen
volunteers spent between six weeks
and three months building an
orphanage in Brazil. The team were
part of the Warboys Orphanage
Project in Brazil. I was one of those
volunteers.
I set off on the 23rd July. 1991.
Ahead of me was a fifteen hour
flight, plus many hours in airport
waiting rooms (The Duty Free
Shop). It was the first time I had
flown, so the prospect was quite
becomes more daunting when you
are travelling with such items as
hand-drills hammers, soil test kits
and solar cells. To our surprise we
were ushered through customs by
an official who appeared to have
had less sleep than we had. W e ' d
made it. Stage one complete and we
had. actually survived A i r France.
It was 4.30am. we had a bus to
catch at 9pm.. .that was sixteen and
a hall hours to see Rio or sleep. The
accommodation we were offered
was in a place called Belford Roxo.

c) Only use your horn when:
1) something blocks your 'lane'.
2) something might block your
'lane". 3) at all other times.
d) Seatbelts are a luxury and an
optional extra, as is opening your
eyes.
One thing you'll notice about cars
in Riois that they are never dented.
This isn't because everyone's a safe
driver - look at Ayreton Senna.
When a Brazilian has an accident,
they do it properly.. .the car
generally doesn't survive.
