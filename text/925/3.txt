7 February 1992 Felix 925 Editorial
editorial
Firstly, let me warn you of the ranty
nature of this editorial. This is
because I am still fuming over the
subject matter.
Attempted censorship of Felix is
not new. Last week members of
Imperial College Union Dramatic
and Operatic Societies, including
ICU President Zoe Hellinger, stole
about 3500 Felices from the
distribution points around college in
the belief that the review of
'Grease' would damage the success
of the production.
In 1987 Felices were removed by
the then City and Guilds Union
Union Bit
Papers are up for sabbatical
elections just over a week away, so
if anyone missed the plea for people
to sit on ballot boxes on 9th/10th
March come and see me. The pay
is £3 per hour. Other than election
Purity Test
Dear Felix,
The Imperial College Science
Fiction Society is compiling a
Purity Test aimed specifically at
students of Imperial and would
welcome any suggestions or
comments. For those who have not
encountered one before, a Purity
Test is a humorous questionnaire
designed to assess the ehtics and
experience (sexual or otherwise) of
Gerbil Responds
Dear Adam,
Re: The name 'Lobo'
My point was that while 'Lobo'
is not a laughable name of itself, it
is if one assumes it under false
pretences, much as if I were to
claim to be French and change my
name to Valerie Giscard D'Estaing.
President, David Tyler, in protest
to a news story which he did not feel
had been reported fairly. Eventually
the 3000 Felices were replaced and
Mr Tyler apologised, though stating
that he thought his action was
justified. I believe that Felix was
subsequently sued over one of the
stories it ran.
In 1981 the last issue of the year
was stolen by persons unknown, for
no obvious reason, though there
were a number of suspects. In this
instance the entire issue had to be
reprinted, and no justice was
forthcoming.
time fun, you can keep yourselves
occupied with ents discos next
Wednesday and Friday and the
massive rag BIBIC collection on
Saturday 16th. That's all.

Reviews Editor, Felix 91-92.
One wonders where individuals
who conduct such actions get their
gall from. Why should the students
and staff of Imperial be kept in the
dark? In this case the main publicity
about the Rag Cluedo event, which
occurred the following Saturday, as
well as all the events occurring on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday which
were minuted in the What's On
page had been removed. If an
independent reviewer - 1 did not
write the review on Grease - wants
to write something derogatory about
it, why shouldn't he or she? Am I
given to understand that the reviews
pages are not allowed to say
anything but good about ICU
events? I fail to see the point of a
newspaper if it is muzzled by any
other organisation. In any case the
reader would soon get wise and
ignore such a newspaper.
Both Zoe Hellinger and DramSoc
have admitted to their complicity in
the affair and have issued apologies.
But it was inevitable that an apology
would be forthcoming and this is
not an issue which can be dismissed
with just that. It is very likely that
many of those involved would not
do it again, but it can be guaranteed
that an attempt will be made to
censor the College Media in the
future unless it is known to be
unacceptable. Certain members of
the Students' Union still think that
the action was justifiable - by which
is meant that it would be done again
in similar situation. It is up to you,
the readership, to decide whether
you want to have the College Media
censored whenever it is convenient
for a minority. Remember that I
was elected to defend the editorial
freedom of Felix and that it must
have been assumed at the time of
my election that I was to decide
what went into Felix and when it
was to be published. It may have
been a wrong assumption - in which
case I should be no-confidenced.
Zoe Hellinger was heavily
involved in the production of
'Grease', leaving only Steve
Farrant (Honorary Secretary,
Events) to run the union office for
large periods of time as Jonathan
Griffiths (Deputy President) has
been ill in hospital. I can see why
the removal occurred, I can
understand why Zoe thought she
could take part in that action to
defend the Union's interests.
Firstly, I do not think the review
concerned would have damaged the
production's takings, and secondly,
the Union is comprised of the
students of the college, and
selectively keeping them in the dark
so that they spend what little money
they have on any theatre production
is unethical. If I had received that
review and refused to publish it for
whatever reason, that would be
censorship. In fact I am stuck in the
no-win situation whereby I am
responsible for everything in Felix,
yet ethically bound to give voice to
anybody's opinion. If you object to
any opinion in any newspaper, the
way to counter it is not be slating
the editor or newspaper, telling
them that they have no right to
publish the opinion, but to write to
that newspaper elucidating your
point of view. Since any opinion is
published, so will yours. This
applies to the RockSoc letter as
much as the Felix theft situation. In
the words of the disclaimer - 'no
opinion expressed in Felix is
necessarily the view of the editor,
the newspaper or any of the staff.'
If you think the quality of Felix, IC
Radio or STOIC is low, the way to
improve them is by joining the
already hard working group of
volunteers who make them what
they are. I am working eighty hours
a week as it is (sigh pitifully) - there
are no more hours in the week to
do any more work in.
Having asked advice from an
independent source, I have been
told that there is little point in taking
disciplinary action against those
responsible as it would be difficult
to prove wrong doing. Therefore I
feel I have to go through different
channels. This will involve finding
the individuals who were
responsible - by their means or by
mine. There will be no victimisation
beyond that - I believe that
individuals have to be made
responsible for their own actions,
and part of that is owning up to what
you have done. The admission and
apology from DramSoc and OpSoc
through Richard Harrison,
DramSoc President, I am grateful
for and is good as far as it goes, but
those who did it must find the
courage to put themselves at the
mercy of the same readership that
they denied Felix to. If I know the
IC readership at all, they won't give
a damn.
