Felix
Stolen
Zoe Hellinger, Imperial College
Union President, admitted on
Tuesday that she had been partly
responsible for the removal of 3500
copies of Felix shortly after they
had been distributed last Friday.
The action was organised by
some members of the cast of
'Grease' who felt that a review of
their production published in last
week's edition of Felix could
damage the ticket sales. One
security guard stopped a group of
people from removing Felices from
the Department of Computing but
the rest went missing without being
noticed.
Miss Hellinger has since
apologised for her actions, saying
that it was one of the 'stupidest
things' she had ever done, but said
that she would not resign unless
students thought that it was
necessary, and that she would be
putting her case to the
Extraordinary General Meeting
(EGM) of the Union held yesterday
(Thursday).
Rumours that a 'motion of no
confidence' in the Union President
would be put to the E G M proved
false, but a motion was passed
which intended to ensure that any
interference in editorial control or
censorship of student media would
be a disciplinary offence in future.
When asked if she felt that she had
got off 'scot free', Ms Hellinger
replied 'you have put me though
hell in the past three days' in a
reference to the vigorous response
of the College's student media to the
disappearance of Felix. Ms
Hellinger also stated that she would
not interfere with the production of
Felix again, but could not give that
guarantee for anyone else.
IC Rag, whose event 'Cluedo'
was advertised in the purloined
edition of Felix, are to be
compensated for the low attendance
at the event. Dramsoc and Opsoc
have issued an apology to Rag for
the damage caused and have agreed
to raise at least Â£750 for charity.
Details have not been finalised, but
the money will not come from
Grease profits but from the
individuals involved. Since Rag also
lost out on general publicity and
interest in events, members of the
cast will be helping at the Rag Fete
on 16th May. Ms Hellinger
described Rag as the 'victims' of the
removal and was 'deeply sorry' for
the effect of the action.
Petitions
Representatives of the Selkirk and
Tizard Halls Residents' Committees
met with M r Angus Fraser, IC
Managing Director, and M r
Gordon Marshall, Director of
Estates, to discuss a petition
distributed to heads of all
departments.
The petition drawn up by the two
hall committees and signed by over
three-quarters of hall residents,
expressed general dissatisfaction
with the poor conditions in
Southside Halls.
In a letter distributed yesterday to
all residents on a 34-week licence,
Ms Sheelagh Crampton, Accom-
modation and Conference Manager,
stated that blocks of rooms in
Southside, Linstead and Weeks
Bio Flood
The fire brigade had to be called to
a flood in the new Chemistry
Building, last Friday evening. An
engine from Kensington fire station
arrived within four minutes of the
call to aid college technicians who
had discovered the flood.
The flood started in one of the
pump rooms in the basement of the
Biochemistry department and had
reached a depth of over three metres
before being discovered. Sub-
Officer Marks, one of the officers
dealing with the flood, said that the
high pressure water had to be turned
off to prevent the water level rising
further. As a result of this there was
a risk of fire from overheated
distillation tanks within the
department.
The fire engine remained at the
building until there was no longer
any danger from the tanks
overheating and left at
approximately 1.00am.
Halls will be set aside for business
use, whilst the remaining rooms
will be free for student use. It has
also been confirmed that students
will not have to pay business rates
and that adequate storage space will
be made available.
The petition listed a number of
complaints about facilities
provided, including excessive rent
levels and completely inadequate
security. According the report of
the meeting, the committees did not
believe that security would improve
when the new college-wide
measures are implemented. The
petition ended by threatening to
damage college recruitment by
letting prospective students know
what conditions are actually like.
