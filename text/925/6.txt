Reviews Felix 925 7 February 1992
For the
James Caan and Bette Middler star
in what is essentially a story of love,
hate and greed peppered throughout
with period songs from World War
One to Vietnam. Caan plays master
of the show Eddie Sparks whose
one-lines and scantily clad dancers
bring whoops of delight from good
old American GI's. Middler is
Dixie Leonard the initially over-
awed niece of Sparks' writer
(George Segal) when she enters the
world of cabaret where the stars
exchange wise-cracks to claim the
limelight. There is no complicated
story or subplots to sustain deep
concentration over the two and a
half hours but the over-played
Vietnam story is dealt with well and
with just enough gore to get the
message across without ramming it
down our throats. Another topic
singled out by director Mark Rydell
that of the senseless purge of
supposedly communist members of
showbusiness. Again he does not
make this the main theme nor is this
an anti-war film in the sense of
Platoon but you're left in no doubt
as to the worthless loss of life over
pace smart
remarks between Dixie, Sparks and
Art Silver (Segal) never lets up and,
like her or loathe her, Midler can
sing.
The Phantom Crapper
The Shawl
Playing at the Etcetera Theatre is
the Shawl by David Mannet. This
is a short three-person play. A
woman looking for answers goes to
see a clairvoyant. The Clairvoyant
and his boyfriend (Martin
McDougall) are looking to cash in
on the 'New Age'. A mixture of her
vulnerability and his perceptive
guesswork and charisma results in
her believing in him, so if they each
get more or less what they
wanted—what's the problem?
That's the question. Mark
Houghton's performance as the
clairvoyant is sharp and convincing.
The other performances were good
but Kaetha Cherney as Miss A was
a little weak at times. An excellent
play—an adequate production.
'Pretty good for above a pub'.

Driving Me Crazy
Poster of the
Cosmos
If I told you this film was written
and produced by John Hughes
(Home Alone) and directed by Peter
Faiman (Crocodile Dundee) you'd
probably assume that Driving Me
Crazy would be, something
special...it isn't.
Driving Me Crazy (formerly
known as 'Dutch') was finished
about a year ago. It seems to have
been released as an afterthought,
being far too weak for a summer or
Christmas release, it was probably
debated whether this film should go
straight to the video shelves.
Storywise, it's nothing special,
Dutch Doolty (played. by Ed
O'Neill, who most recently starred
in Carl Reiner's Sibling Rivalry) a
cement truck leaser, chooses to pick
up his girlfriend's son, Doyle, at an
Atlanta boarding school and drive
him home to Chicago for
thanksgiving. Dutch, an honest
good hearted man, figures the long
drive home will give him and Doyle
a chance to get acquainted.
Unfortunately Doyle does not share
Dutch's enthusiasm for the trip. He
is a snobbish, arrogant, blue-
blooded adolescent and he cares
little for Dutch or his working class
values.
Taken from his sheltered and
privileged world, Doyle Standish is
going to learn about life in the real
world whether he likes it or not on
what turns out to be an
extraordinary trip home.
Gripping stuff eh? Well, you'd be
wrong again, the gags have been
done before, the plot is too linear
and predictable (much too
predictable. The acting is nothing
to write home about, and the
music's dire, oh dear Mr Hughes,
I hope this doesn't happen again,
and for Pete's sake, don't
underestimate the intelligence of
your viewers (even 12 year olds!).
Avoid.
Poo.
production of the London Gay
Theatre Company, which was
recently formed by West End
director Tim Luscombe and Adam
Magnani. It is a compilitation of
five short plays, or rather scenes,
by New York writers.
Homosexuality is a topic in all of
them, but they could not be more
different. There is one scene of a
young baker who is 'that kind of
guy' after all and another about a
yuppie couple having a crisis over
dinner, which is hilarious.
The plays are interesting
whenever they go beyond common
cliches, and often they do. Some of
the acting is fabulous and none is
bad. Why should you go see it if
you are straight? Maybe to see
something you have never seen
before.
