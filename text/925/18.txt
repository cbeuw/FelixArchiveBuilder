hallucinatory substances. If you
were to decide to indulge in the
latter just direct your feet to the
aptly named Jardin Anglais - or
'English Garden' where you can
buy the stuff (of course I wouldn't
know what it is although I think they
call it Shit - pronounced a la
Francaise - or Hash). However, for
those of you who - like me - have
never ever even come close to the
stuff, just ask somebody the way to
Bar le Planteur or in Shakespeare's
Language, 'Planter's.' The drink
there is quite expensive but it is also
where many of the international
school (and thus English speaking)
students hang out. It is also fair to
admit that this place has lately been
invaded by rappers, so beware.
Next step is to find the way to 'Lord
Nelson's pub.' Nelson's is the place
to be, crowded, smoky, expensive
but full of women (and men for you
of the weaker sex, I'd hate to be
called sexist). Drink is very
expensive there, about £2.80 for a
pint of Swiss lager, though you can
buy bottled Guinness or canned
Newcastle Ale which are hideously
expensive. Just get one drink,
mellow out and socialise. Talking
is free in Switzerland. For those of
you out there who smoke, look no
further, a pack of cigs goes for just
under £1.50.
Night Clubbing.
For a town of its size, Geneva is
quite well stocked with night clubs.
They are, not surprisingly, very
expensive. But have no worries,
nobody said you had to visit all of
them.
On the side of the lake you
currently should be on, there are
two night clubs worthy of your
attention, the 'Underground' and
the ' N e w Morning.' The first one
is located in the Veille Ville, or Old
Town. The Old Town is a very
beautiful location and marks
Geneva's original site. Even if you
don't wish to go to a nightclub the
Old Town is a compulsory visit -
just walk about in it and gaze at the
antique shops and at the art
galleries. The 'Underground,' like
most very expensive and exclusive
nightclubs, has only got a tiny door
with a bouncer that wouldn't even
frighten a 5 foot train-spotting
physicist, thus, your first challenge
is to find it. The best way to do so
is to ask someone who looks rich
and who drives an expensive car.
The other way is to walk about the
old town and find a door with a
Ferrari and a Porsche or two parked
in front of it. The second challenge
is to actually get in as the only to
do so is to look rich. This doesn't
mean dressing up nice - it just
means smelling of - no stinking of
- magic money power. Or you can
Geneva Cathedral. Not a wild place.
just to go with someone else that
knows his way in. Once inside
however, you shall see whether it
was worth the effort. The cocktails
served in the two bars of the
U n d e r g r o u n d are worthy o f
attention. It is fair to say however,
that since you do not pay an
entrance fee. drinks are quite
expensive.
Do not worry if you did not
manage to locate or enter the
Underground as there is a very
good bar a few yards up from it, the
Roi Ubu (Ubu King). It has an
amazing selection of superb Belgian
beers - the Belgians and the trappist
monks are certainly amongst the
best brewers in the world. 1 highly
r e c o m m e n d the M o r r Subite
(Sudden Death) or Chimay, both
types o f geuze, the Belgian
equivalent of bitter. The ' N e w
Morning' is located just beside the
lake at Quai des Forces-Motrices
(Motor-forces quay). The entrance
fee has recently increased to about
£7, although the. location with view
on the lake is very pretty, the
ambience varies from great to
merde absoluement (the editor
doesn't like naughty words) (-
which is why I have translated it
into French - Ed). •
Probably the most" famous night-
club in Geneva is 'Arthur's'.
'Arthur's' is big. very big. It has
four dance floors, four bars and a
VIP section. Thus, since rents are
exorbitant in Geneva, it could not
afford to locate itself anywhere else
than in a new Movenpick Hotel
complex beside the airport. The
only to get there late at night is to
walk, which is not suggested
although you won't get mugged in
Switzerland, to take un Taxi or to
hitch- hike. Entrance is free on
week days before 9.00pm (I think)
but it certainly isn't on Fridays and
Weekends. The entrance should set
you back £12 and each non
alcoholic drink will cost you a fiver,
or more depending on the alcohol
content. The answer to this problem
is to get pissed before you go to
Arthur's. The music for the dance
floors, whether good or bad, is
unimportant since whatever they
play, everybody goes on dancing.
In short, Arthur's is a very wild
place indeed and if you can only
afford one bar or nightclub you
should go to this one. Beware that
they will absolutely not let you in
with a pair of trainers so get a
proper pair of shoes beforehand.
If you spend over a night in
Geneva another place worthy of
attention is L'Vsine (the factory).
I don't remember where it is located
but I do remember that it has live
bands and stuff like that and that it
.is usually very cheap (my G o d , a
miracle!) Also 'Short's', located in
the Old T o w n , may have reopened
since my last visit to Geneva. It
used to be a bar with no entrance
fee and a nice little dance floor.
M a x i m ' s is only for the very rich,
and the only way I could afford it
was to go with a friend who knew
the manager and thus got me free
entry and drinks. M a x i m ' s is a
cabaret with a show of lovely young
ladies covered with little material
indeed.
W e l l , there you go - that's all
folks, if you manage your money
carefully, you can get mildly
buzzed with £10 and get into a
night-club with the remaining £10.
Unfortunately there are about as
many chances of this happening as
there are of the Queen Mother
getting pregnant again! So really,
the only way out is to bring loads
of dosh. By the way, if you ever
visit Switzerland, do bring me back
a nice bar of Swiss milk chocolate
and drop it here c/o Felix.
