Hong Kong is a small city situated
near the south east coast of China.
It is at present a British colony and
will be handed over to China after
30th June, 1997. After about one
hundred years of British
government, the Hong Kong
people, the majority being Chinese,
have developed their own culture—
one that is composed of both
oriental and western characteristics.
Apart from being one of the most
densely populated cities in the
world. Hong Kong is also an
important commercial and financial
centre in the Far East. This is partly
due to its free trade policy. In the
future, the role of Hong Kong as a
gateway to China will become more
vital to the economic development
of both regions.
Korea is a unique country for its
phenomenal economic growth and
its ongoing political division. After
the war no one had imagined that
this small, war-torn country was to
become the host nation for the 1988
Seoul Olympics and a newly
industrialised country pursuing the
leading edge in science and
technology. Korea, like other
countries, has its problems. They
are mostly internal, in particular
politics and reunification. There is
much conflict and debate on these
Singapore—the bridge between East
and West. Situated at the southern
tip of the Malaysian peninsular,
Singapore has traditionally been the
meeting point of western traders
travelling via the Straits of Malacca
and Eastern traders using the South
China Sea.
Today. Singapore, gateway to the
East, continues to serve the world
as a hub city. The traditional
shipping economy has flourished
into banking, transportation,
communication and tourism.
Taiwan, a country known for its
abundance of beautiful scenery, is
also perceived by the world to be
.one of Asia's economic successes.
Formerly known as 'Formosa'
'fortress' when she was under
Dutch rule, this island, which is the
only province of China not under
communist rule, has come a long
way since the last world war.
Viewed by many to be a
manufacturer of cheap common
goods, Taiwan has managed
competitive among the
economic powers through
industrialisation with the pursuit of
science and technology.
Singapore is, today, competing with
the nations of the world as one of
Asia's strongest economies.
Singapore has always played the
role of a dark horse in this race of
nations. Singapore's success story
is a story of the triumph of human
spirit. With no natural resources
and a land area hardly half the size
of London, Singapore seemed a
failure from the start, but somehow
she managed to survive and even
thrive in the world today.
