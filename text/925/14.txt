youths looking for dollars. We were
shown two entrances, the only ones
known, both apparently previously
visited by "Americanos' (probably
the Italian group in 1988). Despite
its altitude, the potential in this area
must be low since both entrances
were choked a few metres in. and
there were springs just below in the
village.
Lomo Meregildo was a plateau at
1400m, again reached by mules
from Guyabal. We were shown two
shafts on the south side of the hill
Los Patios, both ending at 10m
depth, and from this high point we
scanned the area east with
binoculars. It didn't look too
p r o m i s i n g , being yet more
undulating terrain with conical
depressions, covered with coffee
and banana plantations. T w o sinks
we did investigate were completely
choked with vegetation, and there
were springs only 10m below.
The area around the village of
Polo, in the easten Sierra de
Baoruca. looked promising on the
map with springs around the village
at 700m, and some very large
closed depressions of between
300m and 700m about 15km further
west. We visited the area for one
day from Barahona to check these
leads. The springs were just that,
with no entrances, and the locals,
who farm the surrounding area, had
no knowledge of any cave entrances
further west. The limestone in this
area was much less massive than
that in the Sierra de Neiba. being
rather impure and shattered. A n
American group had previously
reached the generally inaccessible
western end of the Sierra de
Baoruca. 25km away, but had
found very little. O n this basis it
seems unlikely that Baoruca is the
most promising range for caves as
previously thought.
The final area visited was in the
Cordillera Central, which has the
highest peak, Pico Duarte (317m),
in the Caribbean. F r o m L o s
Copeyes (550m). an 8km mule
journey northeast led to the
Catanamatias Valley (1050m). This
area had been visited once by the
Circolo Speleologico e Idrologico
Fruilano from Udine. and they had
explored the main sink to the
northwest of the village. The Furnia
del Cuadro (aka Respiradero del
Diablo) is, at - 3 8 0 m . the deepest
cave in the Republic. We marked
all the entrances in the valley and
logged them on an enlarged map.
Eight of these entrances gave access
to significant caves, such as Cueva
Malaria - 7 3 m , Cueva Queso
- 5 1 m , and shafts from 10m to 45m
deep. O n the hill to the west the
main d i s c o v e r y was C u e v a
Avenger, a shaft system to — 196m.
To the east, in the Carrizal valley.
The Caving Team
180m of active river passage led to
a sump in Cuevo Rio at —32m. A
small group spent a day walking
8km west to a promising karstic
plateau at 1450m. north of Loma E l
Picacho. This area was the only one
on the expedition to have large areas
of exposed limestone. Cueva del
Hombre Muerta yielded human
remains, presumably from ancient
burial. The main find here was
Cueva Machete, which went to 25m
length and - 150 depth before we
ran out of time, with the rift
continuing on down.

particular caves, and there are still
leads in the Catanamatias area.
Back in Santa Domingo we heard
of more caves, massive and filled
with treasure or voodoo spirits, in
the Cordillera Central, but by then
the rum was flowing, the merengue
music beating loudly, and our flight
back the very next day.
The Republic has beautiful coasts
and mountains, and a rich national
culture, but these are being lost in
its unrelenting drive towards
western style unsustainable
development. Though the likelihood
of finding caves in the Sierra de
Neiba and Cordillera Central
remains good, the potential must
have been decreased by the
devastating effects of deforestation,
fallen trees, m u d f l o w s . and
landslips which have been found
blocking many entrances and shafts
in both the Dominican Republic and
Haiti, denying exploration and
understanding of the caves.
