Travel Felix 925 7 February 1992
Firstly, Geneva is not Switzerland's
capital. Bern is. Geneva is in the
francophone part of Switzerland,
but since about 40% of the people
in Geneva are foreigners, nearly
everybody speaks English anyway.
Geneva is also very small - in fact
you can walk through Geneva in an
afternoon if you don't stop for
chocolate, watches, kirsch etcetera.
Don't do Geneva down though, as
it can be a good laugh even though
there are less pubs in it than in the
Isle of M a n .
Lesson Number 1: Switzerland is
expensive.
There is just no way out of this
one except bar thieving - and Swiss
cops are good, and they carry guns.
Lesson Number 2: Geneva has
less nightlife hotspots than all the
fingers of two people (or four one
armed people).
But since most of you couldn't
afford to spend more than one night,
in Geneva anyway, there are more
than enough for a good night out.
Lesson Number 3: Swiss beer
sucks.
This is totally unescapable and
the only way out is to buy imported
beer which is quite expensive, or to
drink spirits which are even more
so.
Once you have come to grips with
these three lessons (spend a night
or two studying them in front of a
pint or two or six) you are ready for
(aka la gare). Y o u should wander
down to the lower ground floor of
the railway station and exit through
the north door, with one of the
major banks on either side - U B S
and S B S . and go on past
McDonald's and turn left just after.
A few yards further, turn to your
left into a restaurant called Manana
and go down to the basement. Y o u
are now in the 'Cactus club.' Avoid
the beers; they are tasteless, bland
and very expensive. It is essential
for you to arrive there during the
happy hour which usually lasts for
360 minutes from 6.00pm to
9.00pm - although you had better
check this. They have lists of all
their drinks scattered around the
bar. I recommend their flaming

A bit of the Old Town of Geneva.
Although one pound will buy you
two and a half Swiss francs on
average, a pound won't get you far.
Bear in mind that the wages in
Switzerland are high (£7 an hour is
not unusual for a student summer
job). Switzerland also has the
highest G N P per capita in the world
(a trivial pursuit question) and the
standard of living is not all that low
either.
a wild night out in 'Geneve,
Cosmopolite. Captivante et
Capitaliste.'
How to get pissed on less than
£20:
This is virtually impossible but
anyway, here goes. When you
arrive in Geneva you will either be
in Geneva airport (aka Geneve
Cointrain) or in the railway station
B-52, which is Bailey's, Kaluha and
a dash of Grand Marnier set on fire.
Drink this very fast, with a straw.
Alternatively try their lush Pina
Colada or their nice and sour
Kamikaze. This should set you back
£2 a go (during happy hour) and
when you're bored or happy hour
is over, leave for the Post Cafe, the
most English non-pub around. The
owner is British, always drunk and,
surprisingly an ex-physics student
from Edinburgh, I think. Mention
my name and he'll tell you to fuck
off because he has no idea who I
am, although he hates my after-
shave. Drinks are very cheap there,
both in and out of happy hours.
Tequila goes for just over a quid a
shot, and miracles of miracles -
Guinness is on draught! Equally
worthy of attention is a local Swiss
scrumpy n i c k n a m e d ' d r a i n
bamage.' Once you are satisfied
with yourself, and the bar floor
starts to defy the laws of gravity,
you may go on. Further along this
street you will find the Star pub and
the London pub, both very boring
but worth a visit if you've ever
wondered what a Swiss-English pub
looks like, but if you're too pissed
to bother, let me tell you it looks
nothing like the real thing.
The next step is rather more
difficult as you must now find your
was to the other side of the lake.
Lake Geneva is part of river Rhone
and although everybody says it's
clean I wouldn't risk a dive in it.
To go to the other side can be made
easy if you use a bridge. There are
many handy bridges about but for
all practical purposes I suggest you
use the Pont du mont-Blanc. On the
way you really must admire the
highest water jet in the world - Le
jet d'eau de Geneve. At this point
you have two alternatives, visit
more drinking spots or buy some
