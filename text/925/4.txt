Magical Mystery Box
Described as a pop fans wet dream,
or something equally graphical, this
record is the sum of everything that
is bad about 'pop' music. It has as
much sustenance as a BigMac and
is as limp as the slice of green thing
you sometimes find in the middle.
That reminds me of a story about
a friend of a friend of a, well you
know. Well, the crux of the matter
was that this person's (sex
unknown) idea of healthy eating
was not taking the above mentioned
green thing out of their burger.
Anyway, on another part of the
page the plot continues. Did I tell
you, this record is crap.

What complete, utter, total,
absolute crap. A cross between
Nirvana, 'the Guns and Roses that
its O.K. to like' and R E M the 'cult
band from Atlanta'. I feel very
sorry for people that buy records
like this. They think they're being
radical. They think they're being
trendy. Worst of all, they think
they're buying a good record. It
took extreme (there's another crap
group) effort to listen to this. The
first time twenty seconds was all I
could take. Then, with the aid of a
couple of men in white coats and a
couple of meters of extension lead
I made it almost to the end before
I admitted to it and they lifted the
stylus. What a relief.

Assuming that you get this, on •
Friday, which can no longer be
assumed, due to current union
policy, I regret that there's sod all
for you to go to tonight anyway.
The Jennifers at Camden Falcon,
maybe, but that's a right pig to find.
I'm staying in to watch Abba-the
movie on Channel 4, personally.
The Nutty Boys are, as you may
have guessed, formed out of parts
of Madness. If you're feeling
nostalgic, it might be a good time.
If you're feeling a bit more serious
and ethereal, then Lush might be
more suited. Regretably Spitfire are
supporting them, and they're crap,
so arrive late.
Tuesday night, If you feel like
partying the night away, it's that
time of the week to groove and
move to the superb Feet First indie
disco at the Palace. I could make
them sound good with a couple of
out of context quotes from Felix
919 'f-ing brilliant...quite superb'
or maybe not 'harmless, wannabe
E M F . ' Editorial decisions, I don't
know.
Thursday, Boo Hewerdine,
formerly frontman of The Bible,
plays acoustic based guitar at one
of my personal favourite venues,
the well hidden Borderline.
That's it for another week, my
lovelies.

Amy Grant
-Good for Me
When she stopped writing what
many would call Christian music
and concentrated more on the
poppier (if that's a word), more
commercialised stuff. Amy Grant
compromised not only her beliefs,
but also her standing amongst the
Christian community as a great
singer-songwriter.
However, even now that her
music is commercialised it is doing
well. Her album Heart in Motion is
already multi-platinum and Good
for Me is the third single to be
released from it.
After the success of Baby Baby
and Every Heartbeat, not having
listened to the album yet, I was
hoping that this would also be a
winner. It did, I have to admit, take
me a good few listenings to really
like the song. The main trouble
was. that whilst it's true that it's a
nippy little number (whatever that
means), there's just too much going
on.
This, however, is remedied on
the You like to dance mix which is
a lot more listenable and thankfuly
graces the reverse of the single.
If you like Amy (old or new) go
and buy this, if only for the B-side.
And even if it's not as big a hit as
the last two at least it's as happy,
cheery and refreshing as ever.
