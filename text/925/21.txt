Chapter 12:
Detention
Troy Tempest
leads us on.
Stress stared around him at the
frantically dancing figures, puppets
to the rhythms smashing out of the
speakers dotted around the sub-
basement disco, faces sweating and
strained with the torment they were
going through.
He had been brought swiftly to
the jail from the courtroom and
dressed in clothes that would make
him stand out like a sore thumb if
he ever tried to escape. He was
wearing a purple polyester shirt
with gold cufflinks, tight green
trousers, white socks and brown
tassled shoes. The final touch to
these liquorice allsorts of clothes
was his prison number, printed on
a gold medallion chained around his
neck.
Just as Stress thought he could not
go on there was a commotion at one
end of the dance floor. Prisoners
around him stopped their
movements and clustered around
whatever was happening,
Squeezing through the crowd Stress
overheard hushed comments about
what was happening.
'Breakdance.'
'Horrible sight.'
'Poor wretch.'
Poking his head between two
guards Stress saw the source of the
commotion. In a circular space on
the dance floor a prisoner was
spinning crazily on his back, arms
alternatively stretching and pushing
his tormented body around faster
and faster. With a cry he suddenly
The Inner System
'Hey, you!'
A burly bouncer guard in a
tuxedo pointed one of his ring
holders at Stress.
'Get dancing!'
He obeyed, moving his body to
the thudding beat. Stress swirled in
the soupy stew, shuffling with the
smoky sweaty shapes around him.
shifted his body and began spinning
on his head, eyes blank and staring.
Transfixed by the sight the
prisoners around him muttered to
each other.
'He'g gone, they say they never
recover. Just move about with a
bouncing gait and mumble
meaningless lyrics.'
'Yeah. They have to wear special
apparatus on their heads, speakers
connected to their ears to supply
constant heavy noise. It's so they
don't have a relapse.'
'And when they get home a
special inaudiophobia machine fills
the house with sounds to soothe
their nerves.'
'Okay, break it up!"
The head bouncer strode through
the crowd and got the guards to take
the broken prisoner away.
'Pay attention, there's a message
from the warden.'
Silence fell, the music was muted
and a booming voice filled the
room.
T T IS TIME FOR A GUITAR
PIT!'
A wave of fear washed around
the room. Stress felt the prisoners
around him stagger back in shock.
'TWO PEOPLE WILL G O T O
T H E PIT. T H E Y A R E . '
Absolute silence.
' M E R C Y KILLING.'
A gasp of terror from across the
room.
A N D STRESS F A C T O R . '
Stress yelped. Two guards came
over and grabbed him. Prisoners
around pulled away and watched in
fear and fascination as Stress was
dragged across the floor to stairs
leading down to a large sunken
stage set in the middle of the
cavernous room. As he stumbled
down to the bottom the sounds of
previous victims' high pitched
screams and groans echoed around
the black hole. Stress was locked
into a chair, ready to watch Mercy
Killing's fate.
Dear Marge
Blundering on as usual.
Well, well, well. No sooner have
we recovered from the despicable
behaviour of one of our sabbaticals
than another one feels it right to take
into her own hands a decision that
she effectively has no right ot make.
Silencing the media, surely this is
a court martial offence? Yet again,
though, the sabbaticals manage to
wriggle themselves out of a tricky
situation by releasing a press
statement at a time when there is
very little the suffering students can
do to rectify the matter.
Congratulations Zoe on your
perfect timing!
On other matters connected with
DramSoc. Mylan Lester we saw
you! I understand that you were
making good use of the fly gallery
on Saturday night during the Grease
crew party. You lucky, lucky man
- it seems as though you are the only
one actually managing to get it at
the moment as you will see by
reading the following letter:
Dear Marge,
Now that Imperial College Health
Centre has decided to supply free
condoms for us, the poor, repressed
students that we are, my colleagues
and I feel that we have a proposal
that the college and/or students
unions should seriously consider.
We believe that our proposed
Imperial Students Union and
College Brothel (I SUCk Brothels
pic) would be beneficial to all
sectors of the college community
and would fulfil the following
functions:
1. Relieve sexual tensions,
enhancing student and lecturer
performance in all areas.
2. Provide some much needed
revenue for our dear, dear rector,
(after all, being a non-executive
director of BT must leave him
terribly impoverished).
3. Prevent the Health Centre's
condoms from going to waste, this
is Imperial College after all.
This is a significant problem
potentially leading to irrevocable
damage for the notoriously fragile
male ego, and should be addressed
in a serious forum such as yours.
In keeping with the egalitarian
position of the ICU, such an
organisation would be open to all
(even Physics 1). Also, if run along
the same lines as many of the other
college services (Southside etc), it
could make use of student labour
and could provide a much needed
top-up for Student Loans and
Access Funds.
We would be grateful for a
serious, open-minded and, above
all, smutty discussion of this topic
and would welcome comments, and
photographs(!) from all parts of the
college.
Yours sincerely.
Desperately Desperate,
DoC 2.
Please, if any one has any obscure,
obsequious, obstreperous, obscene
or obstinate obloquies to make on
this or any other matter, I will be
willing to accept letters without
proof of identity. Serious comments
should be directed to the Editor who
will require signatures.
