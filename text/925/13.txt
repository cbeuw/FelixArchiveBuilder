Travel Felix 925 7 February 1992
A group from Imperial College
visited the Dominican Republic for
six weeks of cave exploration in the
summer of 1990. Previous groups
had explored mainly horizontal
river caves in the east, but we aimed
to check out the mountains in the
west and southwest for deeper
vertical systems.
To decide on specific areas we
used 1:50.000 maps, the geological
map of the island and the reports
from the three previous groups who
were American. Canadian and
Italian. The first three areas were
population. This was solved by
repopulating the country with
A f r i c a n slaves. F o l l o w i n g
independence there were a series of
political struggles and civil wars,
and most recently a border conflict
with Haiti, so it is not surprising
that every village has a military post
and would-be cave explorers need
to go carefully.

passages once dived by Rob
Palmer, and then headed out of the
city through the chaotic traffic.

explored Cueva Cantamento to

west (15,00m) with a rolling
'cockpit' style karst, we dropped a
number of large shafts, all choked
at the bottom, the deepest being
— 71m. After 8 days we had
checked out all the entrances known
to the locals and despite the
promising nature of the topography
on the map. we were confident that

productive area was in the
Cordillera Central. The limestone
in these areas are Lower Tertiary,
and the associated structures and
volcanics have been generated by
movement of the Caribbean plate.
In Santa Domingo we made
contact with D r Jiminez, Director
of the country's Natural History
Museum, who was helpful and
supportive in providing us with the
all-important letter of introduction
to show to the local headmen and
military authorities.

a turbulent military history and is
only now beginning to stabilise.

Imagine driving in a crowded city
where motorists don't need to take
a test, have their eyesight checked,
or insure themselves. Cars don't
need an M O T . the roads are rarely
repaired, and cars are so expensive
they are never scrapped. To quote
the guidebook: ' Y o u like watching
horror movies? Y o u ' d like to take
part in one? Try driving in Santa
Domingo'.
Our first area was in the centre
of Sierra de Neiba (Hills of Fog).

in the Christmas of 1986/87. and

there was little else to do in the area.
The second area was 16km
further west, next to the Haitian
border, based on the impoverished
village of Sabana Real (1300m). but
close to the enticing Loma el
Hoyazo (Hill of the Depressions) at
1900m. Haiti is the poorest country
in the western hemisphere, and has
only 3% of its primary vegetation
left (compared with a stunning 6%
in the Dominican Rebublic).
Haitans often cross the border
looking for employment. This
movement is allowed, since it is a
source of cheap labour for the
Dominican Republic's plantations,
but it is very closely monitored by
the military. Therefore security was
a problem and we had to guard the
vehicle during the day. since we
