ourselves in the back of the car. we
did see some of the famous sights
of Rio. Copacabana Beach, Sugar
Loaf Mountain, the Statue of Christ
overlooking the shanty towns, the
'shit brown' river and the streets
with homeless kids. A l l in all. we
were glad to leave Rio. However
this involved a 24-hour bus journey.
It did stop at four hour intervals for
the essentials. O h yes, Brazilian
toilets - another o f B r a z i l ' s
innumerable and unmentionable
experiences. The next stop was the
orphanage site.
When I arrived the foundations
were dug and the well was drilled
(by hand) to a depth of 8m. Ahead
was a lot of hard work, a lot of rice
and beans and a lot of chlorinated
water. A l l this in the delightful
4 5 ° C dry heat.
The site was primitive, but had
everything in a manner of speaking.
A hut. a tent, a cooker, the well,
a manual flush toilet and a solar
panel array for recharging car
batteries and running our tape
recorder.
The team worked all the days
they c o u l d . W e filled the
foundations with hand mixed
concrete and by the time we left, we
had built the walls to roof level.
During this time the team got to
know each other very well. We had
arguments, and disagreements, but
we all had an excellent time.
The project had its set backs. A
massive bush fire wiped out most
of the surrounding land (and came
within a metre of our hut), sand was
late in arriving, and one of our dogs
died.
Amongst this work, we did see
some of the country. We toured
around Brasilia—scene of the
famous 'lamb roast' cathedral, the
modern art statues and sculptures,
and the concrete buildings which
would make Prince Charles's
stomach churn but serve no other
purpose. Brasilia was built in the
1970s—a custom built capital
city—so it has everything. Including

We also took a few days to see
Foz de Igacu. on the border
between Paraguay. Argentina and
B r a z i l . This consists of 287
waterfalls, or rather 286 and a
hydro-electric power station. We
visited both Paraguay and
Argentina—but we only really saw
the 'high streets'. The South

is...original. Physical abuse is more
common than pleasant shop window
displays. A s you walk down the
street, your arm gets wrenched by
shop assistants 'inticing" you to see
their shop.

phrase to know—but my Portuguese

Paraguay is a country of forgery.
You can buy 'Rolex' watches for
about £3. O f course not all fakes are
realistic.'Levistile' 502's spring to
mind, (an upgrade perhaps?).
Citizen watches didn't fool too
many either.
By the end of six weeks I was
ready to go home. I was sick of
chlorinated water, rice and beans,
Brazilian beer and shop assistants.
I do want to return to the country
and the orphanage though. I have
many fond memories of the place.
the people and the lifestyle. I also
hope that the situation for the
children improves soon. At the
moment their prospects are bleak;
drug barons, prostitution and worse
still with the black magic cults in
Brazil.
The Warboys Orphanage Project
is one o f many projects working in
Brazil. Every little helps. If you
could help, or want to join the team
going out this summer, or next
summer, get in touch. If you have
any ideas to raise money, or
anything, it'll be appreciated.
