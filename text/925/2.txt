Letters Felix 925 7 February 1992
Good, bad, ugly & short review Library
Dear Adam
There is apparently a dearth of
arts critics in the Felix office. This
was bourne out by Steve
Newhouse's (The good, the Bad,
the Ugly and the Short) article on
Grease. Who obviously doesn't
have a clue what he is talking about.
Mr Newhouse appears to have a
large piece of deep fried potato on
his shoulder about the £8k of union
money invested in the production.
Therefore the plethora of criticism
heaped against the cast, production
team and directors seemed out of
place.
The article should have been held
back until Grease had finished its
run. Such a jaded article which
lacked any form of constructive
criticism could not have done the
production any favours. Nor would
Mutual annoyance
Dear Adam,
We are annoyed that DramSoc
removed the vast amount of Felix's
from college. Felix is an
independent newspaper which,
though people insist is going
downhill, is infinitely better than
other student rags. It has a dedicated
team working all hours to get it to
us and it is unfair that the vast
amount of students should be denied
the opportunity to read about all the
other goings-on in college.
Whilst we can recognise that
DramSoc and the CCUs may be
slightly annoyed that the review was
not all gold, a member of the stage
crew did tell us that the review was
accurate. The editorial encouraged
people to see the production and let
people decide for themselves.
Due to these representatives of
DramSoc committing the act of
depriving the students of IC of the
Felix Newspaper we demand that
an explanation is written as to why
Rocksoc complaint
Adam,
I am writing this letter to
complain about the treatment of
Imperial College Rock Society in
issue 923 of 'Felix' on January
24th. When I enquired in person for
an explanation on Tuesday 27th all
I received was a mumbled T
thought that's what you wanted'
before you ran off to hide
somewhere. In the face of such
blatant rudeness, perhaps you will
be brave enough to offer an
explanation in writing.
Imperial College Rock Society
spend a great deal of time, money
and effort in putting on events for
the benefit of the whole college.
The success of these events depends
on the response from the students.
Along with the posters and flyers
produced it was considered that an
advert in 'Felix' was the most
efficient method of reaching the
majority of the student body. The
treatment our press release received
at your hands was not what we
'wanted' or expected!
To quote the article entitled 'Son
of Magic Box': 'Thursday,
Ignorance etc. IC Union £21 £3. I
believe it's somewhere in South
Kensington. I dunno, I've never
been there.' For your information,
and future reference, the 'Felix'
offices happen to be situated in the
Union Building, and are, as a matter
of act, right next door to the Union
Lounge, where the gig was held—
a fact which is painfully obvious to
The mouse that roared back
Dear Adam,
It was with some pleasure that I
started reading Christopher Adams'
letter printed in last week's Felix.
However, this soon turned to
disgust as he criticised the work that
myself, Gina Mortley and Jeremy
Burnell have put in on Wednesday
and Friday evenings this term.
Standing at the entrance to Beit
Arch for over 5 hours on bitterly
cold nights, is no-one's idea of fun,
however much you are paid, and
some of us have done this Without
payment.
Mr Adams had to sign in on
Friday 24th as he could produce no
valid Union Card. He phoned up
the bar and a few minutes later
Suzanne Ahmet came out to sign
him in. When I next looked in the
book, I saw he had signed in as ' M
M O U S E ' , the first of several that
tried to come into the Union that
evening, (one of which was
accompanied by a 'D DUCK'). I
phoned up the bar and asked
Suzanne to send him out to sign in
again, which he did.
The instigation of Union card
checks on Wednesday and Friday
nights, followed a series of
incidents at the end of last term,
which included an attempted rape.
With the involvement of the
sabbaticals, the licensees of the Bar
and the seven Duty Officers, we
it have helped the union recouperate
its investment.
The production was an excellent
interpretation of the musical-and,
provided a great evening's
entertainment.
Yours sincerely,

one with even the lowest IQ let
alone an IC student or graduate! As
if this purile attempt at what I can
only guess is humour, wasn't
enough, the article went on to say:
'In reverse order, in third place,
Ignorance, who I have never heard
of. Don't blame me if they're
shite...' If the so-called Music
Editor, Poddy hasn't even heard of
the band, his biased, ill-informed
opinions are best kept to himself.
It is sad enough that this style of
journalism exists in the 'Felix'
office, but by sanctioning the article
you violated your duty as Editor to
give equal and fair representation.
If this responsibility is too much for
you, perhaps you would be better
suited applying what talents you
reviewed our security procedures.
Card checks are one of several ideas
that are being implemented
following this meeting.
The Union bar has a private club
licence, that is only members of
ICU can use it. This is not the
Union's idea, but the L A W , and
like all pubs no alcohol may be
drunk on the premises once
drinking up time is over. This a
maximum of 20 minutes, not the 30
or 40 minutes that many customers
seem to think.
To answer the final points in the
letter. If you think I have been arse-
licking up to any sabbatical this
year, why don't you ask them? As
SCC Chairman and an officer of
Dear Editor.
Following your two reports on
the Central Libraries on 24 January,
may I offer reassurance to Ms
Hellinger and other worried library
users.
Fines will not apply to all overdue
books: only to books from the
heavily used short loan collections,
or reserved by another user, or long
overdue. A warning notice that a
book is due back will always be sent
before a fine is levied.
The proposed joint library with
the Science Museum, amongst other
things, should extend access to its
collections in the evenings. There
are no plans to shorten existing
opening hours at the weekends.
The Science Museum Library
currently opens at 10.00am and one
proposal is to make this the opening
time of the joint library. However,
no final decisions will be taken until
staff and library users have been
consulted.
Yours sincerely
Richard Halls, Sub-Librarian,
Reader Services.
may possess elsewhere.
It is well known that 'Felix' is
largely if not totally biased towards
Indie and Rave music reviews.
However, this does not justify your
actions which caused irreparable
harm to our event. In the three years
I have spent at this college I have
seen the quality and standard of
'Felix' drop, most noticably in this
present year, with the
aforementioned copy probably
reaching new depths. If this steady
decline continues I would advise my
fellow students to stop bothering to
read 'Felix', but if they must do so,
'don't blame me if it's shite!'.
A D Ham,
Vice President, IC Rock Society.
Imperial College Union, I have
never hesitated in criticising them
if they deserve it. And as for the
sabbatical position, you'll have to
wait and see.
Finally, Duty Officers, identified
by their orange authority badge, are
entrusted by the Deputy President
and the Union with a lot of authority
and responsibility. If A N Y member
of ICU feels that they are abusing
their position, a formal complaint
should be made to the Deputy
President, as well as the letters page
of Felix.
Yours sincerely
Steven Newhouse
(Duty Officer & SCC Chairman)
