Ingorance -IC Union
What would you expect from a band
described as 'indie-metal' going
under such a ponderous monicker
as No Joy in Mudville? Well, they
sounded a bit like U2 at times, a bit
like Ride at other times but with
vocals best described as 'operatic'.
Oh, and they were actually rather
good. A bit too indie for the die-
hard headbangers in the audience,
but by the end of the set everyone
else was dancing.
Ignorance were very good
indeed. Opening as usual with Sean
they ran through a selection of
tracks from their first album The
Confident Rat and their
forthcoming release.
This was all good, solid funk
metal, with obvious Faith No More
influences but plenty of originality
in there too. After 45 minutes or so
of this, which won over an initially
wary audience and had them
bopping away in front of the stage,
the band started to get silly with an
obscene cover version of
Madonna's Holiday, followed by
EMF's Unbelievable, Mordred's
State of Mind, Nirvana's Smells
Like Teen Spirit, Diamondhead's
Am I Evil (a song better know for
Metallica's cover) before the bassist
left the stage for reasons best known
to himself. A new bassist was
recruited from the audience for one
final song before the band fled with
cries of 'bass solo!' leaving the poor
sod on stage with somebody else's
bass and an audience to please. Not
the anticipated end to the concert,
but then, we hadn't expected the
band to turn up with short hair
either.
Still, the messing about can be
excused for a band playing to 60-70
people when they expect to pack out
the Marquee next month

Pele
-Windsor Old Trout
Windsor again. Anyone would
think it was easy to get to. It is,
actually, if you have a car, or can
persuade someone with a car to go
for the promise of tickets. Whizz
Whizz along the M4. Whizz Whizz
down to the Riverside. Look at the
swans. They're easy to see in the
dark, because they're white. It's so
lovely, picturesque, lovely, (puts on
Damyank accent) quaint, and
lovely. The Old Trout, conversely,
is more like a village hall. I like
village halls.
Mexico 70 were going to headline
tonight. I wish they had. Then I
could have gone home after their
first song. Fortunately, I managed
to get myself distracted into talking
to a couple of Pele who were
wandering around in the audience,
saving me from listening to too
much of them Bye bye, Mexico 70
(Mexico wave! heheheh)
Pele came on. The place livened
up. The sun started metaphorically
shining, and we all started dancing.
Raid The Palace, appropriate
enough for Windsor (Castle, the
queen lives there sometimes.) was
a storming song, and so were all the
rest.

Dear RockSoc
Biased and uninformed! I have
seen a wide variety of bands
perform their own particular thing
live. Have you ever widened your
scope to see the London Chamber
Orchestra? 808 State? James? I
doubt it. My friend, it is you who
are biased and ill-informed.
But why shouldn't I be? The
reviews pages can only be opinion,
never fact. Let's face it, the bias of
the news pages should be of more
concern for unbalanced reporting
than anything that appears on my
pages. If you object, then may I
suggest that you take the union
sanctioned method of expressing it,
that of removing all the Felixes. As
for bias towards indie/rave music,
that is the area where most interest
comes from, and the area from
where all the innovation in the
current music scene does come. I
hardly call Guns & Roses covering
Live and Let Die amusing or
innovative.
And I would have thought that
anyone with the lowest IQ could
spell puerile.
I am not the alleged Music
Editor. I am.
