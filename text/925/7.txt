Walpurgis Night
Lost for
Words
This play, written by Venedict
Erofeyev, has been translated from
the Russian by Snoo Wilson, and is
directed by 24 year old Dalia
Ibelhauptaite. It is set in a
psychiatric hospital. Our hero
Gurevich admits himself to the
hospital so that he can be close to
Natalia who is a nurse. This would
definitely raise questions as to his
soundness of mind. He is in Ward
3, surrounded by loonies of one
description or another. There is
little plot beyond this. As each of
the 'inmates' takes it in turn to pour
out their heart, any philosophical
questions raised are trivialised and
abandoned. The events go beyond
farce in the second half when all of
word 3 break into song and then,
one by one, leave this mortal coil.
I don't quite understand what this
play was trying to do but it failed
in all areas as far as I was
concerned. They used cheap
analogies, crude symbolism and
cliche after cliche. The direction
was awful. With such a big cast and
some well respected actors in it, I
was disappointed that most of the
acting was appalling, except for the
acting genius of the catatonic
inmate.
Walpurgis Night runs until the
end of February. Phone the Box
Office on 071-229 0706 for
performance times and prices.

What can I say?
'Absolutely hilarious' are two good
words when describing this book.
Deric Longden's bizarre way with
words and phrases keeps you in
stitches for most of the novel and
in tears for the rest.
After the death of his wife, he is
left with little more than nightmares
and his dithering mother. His
mother is a sweet old lady whose
heart is in the right place but,
unfortunately you can't say the
same about her brain.
It is basically his memories of the
months spent trying to get back into
the feel of writing so soon after his
wife's death, mainly because they
all feel it would be good for him.
His children are supportive, his
mother is barmy and the blind
woman who he moves in with is
determined not to let her disability
rule her life.
I loved the book, it has its
humour, its sadness and even the
hanging questions all in the right
proportions. Read it and see if you
nearly wet yourself when you read
about the sprouts just as I did.

The Camomile Lawn The Antipope
Mary Wesley started writing in her
mid-sixties and has a whole life time
of experiences to draw on, this
shows in all of her books.
The Camomile Lawn is a story
about seven cousins and their
friends, set around the time of the
second world war.
The story starts with the cousins
meeting on their regular summer
holiday at the old aunt's house in
Cornwall and goes on to record
their lives throughout, the war,
including the various partner
swapping and sexual experiences.
The sex itself is not actually
described, making you use your
own imagination and preventing
Ms. Wesley from stooping to the
level of Jackie Collins and the like.
Although the story line is limited
and very tacky, the book holds a lot
of charm and is written with a very
dry sense of humour. The novel is
based mainly in London, but the
odd snippets of. country life in
Cornwall help to relieve the tension.
There are many different
personalities in the novel; my
favourite of them is an old general
who thinks that Hitler is a well
organised and upstanding member
of the community, and that the
Nurnberg Rally was all round good
fun. His attitude doesn't help when
a couple move into the area after
escaping from the Nazis in Austria.
Their son is in a concentration camp
and the General more often than not
puts his foot in it completely. I
enjoyed the book immensely
although it is directed more towards
the female population.

Robert Rankin tries far too hard to
be like Terry Pratchet but
unfortunately does not succeed. The
story line for this book is humorous
enough and it is a shame that he
attempts to turn Brentford into a
scene from the Disc World.
On to the story, Neville the part-
time barman and general underdog
wakes up one morning feeling not
quite right. The tramp who appears
later that day is the key to it all.
Without giving the story away too
much the book ends with a holy
exorcism; fire, water and a few
Latin phrases. The book loses its
initial humour towards the end but
the element of drama is introduced
to fill the gap.
Having lived near Brentford for
most of my life I managed to get a
feel for the area but, as the
descriptions provided by M r .
Rankin were fairly vague, any one
without my knowledge is likely to
lose interest very quickly.
The characters were developed
but unfortunately very late and
meant that you did not have time to
experience feeling for them.
I can't say I didn't enjoy the book
at all, it did have its moments and
if there is nothing else to do, worth
a read. D B C
