Rugby Champions
Imperial College Rugby 1st X V
progressed into the quarter-finals of
the U A U Championship for the first
time last Wednesday, with a
comprehensive victory over
Reading at Harlington.
The first half was tight with IC
achieving territorial and
possessional dominance, and the
home team went in at half time 6
points up after 2 penalty kicks from
fly-half Stuart Paynter. The score
might have been more but for the
sterling work of the Reading
back-row.
IC started alot more positively in
the second half and scored their first
try after good forward work and
quick passing along the line. The
move was finished off by David
Hockey
On 22nd January, the Men's 3rd XI
Hockey almost triumphant U A U
Championship run began against
Kent University at Canterbury. The
pilgrimage began in traditional style
with the opening of the bell's team
spirit in the minibus on the M2. The
team, already baffled by '-The Sun'
crossword, played accordingly for
most of the game.
The first seventy minutes of
normal time saw little action.
Captain Sven Jones somehow
managed to avoid having to score
in the one on one situation just as
the half time whistle was blowing.
Dan Lee with the keeper beaten
Fleming and then converted. The
flood gates soon opened after
Reading's two best players had been
taken off - their scrum-half had to
be taken off after a shoulder charge
from captain Andrew Montgomery,
which was so late it would have
been placed in next Wednesday's
match.
Simon Bicknell scored soon after,
after a blind-side break which was
followed by a converted push-over
try by John Fowler. IC were totally
in command from then on having
supremacy in the scrum and
Fowler, Marquis and Sapwell all
doing good work in the line-out.
Dave Bolton was next to get on the
score sheet after a break and chip
through by Richard Stubbs, who
mustered the power of an amoeba
and his shot was cleared off the line,
while Nick Parfitt's shot hit the
corner flag.
With no score after full time,
news of extra time was hit with a
groan. However we played better:
end to end stuff with the lads giving
110% (as out footballing friends
would have it). With eight minutes
left Parfitt scored from a short
corner, most atypical. Six minutes
later the scores were level after the
ball was squeezed between the
keeper and Lee Maartensz's legs
while Chris Maury was unable to
clear off the line for once.
replaced Andy Fleming mid-way
through the second half. The try
was converted and Bicknell scored
a second try following a mid-field
break by Paynter, D Fleming and
pack leader Henry Fadge. This
completed the rout of Reading with
a 32-0 scoreline. Chris Telling had
a good game after 4 weeks off
becausfe of having a varicose vein
removed. IC's next opponents will'
be Surrey.
The following is full team list, for
those who haven't had their names
mentioned in this report!
Corbett, Carr, Cadden, Marquis,
Sapwell, Telling, Fadge, Fowler,
Montgomery (C), Paynter, D
Flemming, Bicknell, A Flemming
(Stubbs), Bolton, Flynn.
Hence penalties wee to settle it.
'Such a terrible way to end such a
close fought game' or so the cliche
goes. But we weren't complaining
as we won. In the bar Jones won the
boat race - an unprecedented
achievement, whilst David Edwards
had to drink his with his white sock
covering his glass.
Big thanks to Matt for his
undying support and careful
driving.
On January 29th, we played
Brunei at Harlington in the next
stage of the U A U Championship.
With prematch confidence high,
this was a most bogus game. Simon

we're e showing it in Cinemascope.
The discovery of a black monolith
on the Moon that is far older than
Mankind itself tells us we're not
alone. Upon its unearthing, the
monolith beams a signal out to one
of the Jupiter moons. A spaceship
is dispatched to find out who or
what received the signal...

If you are inspired to join the
society, talk to us at the exhibition
or come to Southside Lounge on
Tuesdays at 1pm.
Curwood turned up at the eleventh
hour to replace an ill Lee
Maartensz, much to the relief of
Russell Collins who was next in line
to fill the kickers.
Not wanting to dwell too much on
this game - we had all the play, hit
the post three times, the first after
just a minute. In the second half
they scored with their only two
attacks. Sour grapes, me ?
Here's to another run next year.
