Travel Felix 925 7 February 1992
May day celebrations in hyper-
active Granada go on for three days
and when you tell them that back
home you dance around a pole or
put bells on your legs and bang
sticks together whilst waving
handkerchiefs in the air they laugh
and invite you to flamenco.
Throughout this festive period the
towns multitude of squares sprout
ten foot crosses. The 'cruz' as they
are known are the blood red of over
ripe poppies, and look down on a
pleading Virgin Mary who in turn
looks upon the people. Scattered
haphazardly around each like the
disgorged contents of a bric-a-brac
Camden antiques-junk shop are
mirrors in gilt frames, candles,
tables, chairs, sherry bottles, plates
came prancing dancing slobbering
horses clip-clopping on the cobbles
with bowed heads—riders upright
and precise as yoga practitioners
with black wide brimmed velvet
hats and tapering tight belted
waistcoats.
As the day retreated, tiny
pipistrelle bats scampered over the
dying sky. Myriads of bleating
swallows swooped and swerved
about the Alhambra palace glowing
red on the hill above proud Tuscan
poplars. We retreated to the
Moslem quarter of town on the
north side of the Darro River valley
and overlooking an avalanche of
lights staccato below the palace.

of money and plants in pots. In each
is an apple with a pair of scissors
skewering it in superstitious
tradition.
These gaudy creations adorning
each square are organised by the
residents of the plaza. In the larger
arenas dancing is organised
flamenco style to the singing
loudspeakers. Flamboyant children
strut like cockerels, combs
flickering in robotic jerks. Proud
straight faces in unsmiling
concentration and rigid legs jarring
on hollow boards.
In the dusty squares beneath the
crosses, couples bill and coo and
prance in flamenco steps eye-to-
eye. Bodies swoon and sway below
rigid necks in contact-free limbos.
'Pick an apple—take a bit—and
drop it on the ground', their hands
and arms sing out this mime, whilst
dusty boots stamp off the beat. A
new tune brings a wave of hands,
fingers curled to pick another
apple—in a synchronised harvest.
Through the crowded streets
conversation we sipped sweet mint
tea and gazed at the gaudy cavorting
Catholic horses skidding up the
steep cobbles through a window
veiled in condensation.
On the third day of celebration,
the painted ladies flood the streets
of Granada in gay lampshade
dresses of purposeful colour
clashes. Shocking pinks, tar black
polkadots, Gypsy beiges and dusty
pollen yellows, are all framed by
coal black lace and emulsion white
ribbons. Children too are painted on
this day and sit stuffed and pretty
in prams of ribbons and roses.
Carnations litter the streets and
castanets clatter in gabbling hands.
When you enquire where they are
going, they reply 'Nowhere
special,...just around.'
And around they went, through
alleys and streets as tight as their
bulging dresses, from plaza to
plaza, swaggering beneath the
crosses in flirtatious gloating pride.
All night they pluck apples from
imaginary trees in flamenco mime,
unwilting until dawn when they
melt away, sloshing with sticky
sherry as dry as the local ramblers.
It is less than two weeks later that
El Rocio arrives. The little church
of Pedra and Pablo was bulging by
ten o'clock. Half an hour into the
service the big oak doors were flung
open by the crowds standing outside
in the sun bleached courtyard. I
perched teetering on the edge of a
big mahogany confession box.
Peering round the corner I could
just make out the golden altar
dressed in flowers and shining with
a golden light which fell on the
priest and the flamenco choir in a
halo of blessing. The congregation
of gaudy brash bucksome women,
jostelled with scowling nuns and
grinning priests. It reminded me of
a school play with the proud
brooding congregation of parents
looking expectantly at their
offspring on stage.
The preaching, fist clenched
sermon was punctuated by the
singing to guitar and drum
accompaniment. The castanets
clicked, the tambourines tingled and
the choir sang—red lipped and
pouting in a trance of brilliant
daylight flowing thorugh the doors
at the end.
The aisles were clogged with
passing people—shocking pinks,
brilliant whites, olive greens,
embroidered leaves and flowers,
lace—pulcadots, fluorescent greens
and oranges, hair pulled tight and
wet and black as tar tied up top and
crowned with flowers and grasses
in an upright tuft.
The singers completed their
repertoire and ened with three
resounding cries of 'Viva'. The
alter was dismantled and processed
out by those most bucksome. Pipers
walked backwards in front of the
standard beating goatskin drums
with one hand. Flower displays
were gathered by girls and all
followed the standard in an orderly
jumble, like dancing honey bees.
Old women wept as they grabbed
and kissed the tassels. The people
washed and flowed outside into the
sunshine to join the men on
horseback on the walk to Paseo del
Padre Manjon.
The oxen pulled a silver plated
coach of Arabic script with a
clapping, singing wake of Spanish
senoritas. It stopped under the eves
of a three storey house in a tight
street. Confetti floated down and
gusted round the crowds. We
followed the confetti on the wind,
down to Plaza Nueva and round the
town to the final church. The horses
grew in number, clattering,
slipping, skidding. A man stood on
the corner launching rockets which
exploded above the town with white
puffs and loud sudden bangs which
