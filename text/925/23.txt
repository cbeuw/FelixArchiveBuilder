EGM Super Plug II Nicked
The main business of the
Extraordinary General Meeting
(EGM) of the Union called for
yesterday (Thursday) was to elect
a new Rag chair following the
resignation of Marc Ellis, aka
Penguin, last term. The candidates
were Aled Fenner, Civ Eng II and
Marc Ellis, Physics II, and Mr Ellis
won with a comfortable majority.
Nicky Fox was ratified as Housing
Officer, Tim Cotton, Royal School
of Mines Union President, was
ratified as Transport Officer and
Cathy McClay, ex City and Guilds
Union President, was voted in as
Ordinary Member to Council.
A motion on student poverty was
passed instructing the Union
Executive to publicise the National
Union of Students' demonstration
on Wednesday 12 February,
assembling at Battersea park at
12.00pm. It also instructed the
Union to demand a freeze on
College rent and canteen prices by
writing to the Managing Director of
the College. A motion on third
world debt was defeated, as was a
motion on the affiliation of the
Union to the Anti-Nazi League. In
addition, a motion was passed
calling on sabbaticals to propose a
change to the Union Bye-laws
allowing departmental represent-
atives to vote on the Union Council.
Bar
Scrum
The Union Building was the site of
violence last Friday when an IC
student and two non-students came
to blows over a racist comment.
The student was provoked to
violence after being verbally abused
by guests in the Union Building.
The subsequent scuffle was halted
by bar staff. As the bar closed for
the evening, violence again erupted
and to avoid any further fighting,
the duty officers and the bar staff
closed the gates in Beit Arch. The
two non-students remained inside
Beit Quad and the student waited
outside until the police arrived after
being called by Security officers in
the Sherfield Building.
Although the confrontation was
broken up, complaints have been
made that the non-students had got
off without any action being taken
by the Police, and that had there
been adequate card checks the non-
students would not have got in.
The news teams of IC Radio,
Student Television of IC ' S T O I C
and Felix have set up a news
network for co-ordination and co-
operation in College news
reporting. Called ' C N N ' , the
College News Network, it coincides
with proposals to set up a national
student news service for all student
Bare
After the revelations about Paddy
Ashdown's social life and
allegations that the Liberals have
been heavily canvassing in Evelyn
Gardens Susan Broidy, prospective
Parliamentary candidate for
Kensington and Chelsea, will be
interviewed on Friday 7th February
at 8.00pm on IC Radio. Ms Broidy
will also take part in a debate about
student welfare on the television
service STOIC later the same
evening with Zoe Hellinger, IC
Union President, and possibly with
the President of the National Union
of Students, Steven Twigg. (iCNN)
Students from Selkirk Hall were
among those summonsed by
Westminster City Council last week
for non payment of the community
charge. The poll tax cases, which
were heard at Horseferry Road
Magistrates' Court, indicate that
Westminster Council is protecting
itself against the difficulties faced
by other councils on the
inadmissibility of computer
evidence in community charge
cases.
The disarray has been caused by
a recent appeal court ruling that
computer evidence is not acceptable
for civil cases in courts lower than
the High Court. The Government
has introduced an emergency
amendment to the Local
Government Finance Bill, currently
going through the House of Lords,
to rectify this loophole in the law,
but until this becomes law Local
Authorities have to decide for
themselves how to prosecute these
cases.
The Association of Local
Authorities have also released a
survey claiming that London
councils have issued over 1.8
million summonses for non
payment of poll tax. Hammersmith
and Fulham council, who this week
announced a poll tax increase of Â£3,
told the Imperial College News
Network (iCNN) that they were
radio stations.

NUS
The Polytechnic of Central London
Students' Union (PCLSU) has
suspended payment of its affiliation
fee to the National Union of
Students (NUS) following
allegations of 'gross negligence and
corruption' in the N U S .
Complaints have been raised
about, the length of time a student
at PCL has been kept waiting over
a legal matter by the NUS, and
there is general disquiet over the
NUS' conduct during the recent
Winter Conference. (McGarel,
PCL)
prosecuting 2000 summonses a
week. Kensington and Chelsea
council have suspended any action
against non payers until the matter
is finally resolved when the Local
Government Finance Bill becomes
law in early March.
Confusion over community
charge cases has not affected
Imperial College. College finance
controller, Malcolm Aldridge, told
i C N N that if the college defaulted
on its half million pound bill for the
uniform business rate (UBR), they
would be prosecuted in the High
Court. Computer evidence is
acceptable in High Court cases. Mr
Aldridge also told us that while IC
is an educational charity, and so is
liable for reduced rate UBR,
separate college industries, like
Imperial Exploitation Limited, are
liable for 100% of the rate.
Imperial College Union are
awaiting clarification of the bill for
the Union bookstore. Although it is
currently paying 20% of the UBR,
the Government district valuer has
decided that the bookshop is liable
for the full amount and the Union
has appealed against this decision.
College lawyers are expected to
argue that as the bookshop provides
a service for students and staff of
the College, it should not be treated
like any other high street shop.

Students of Imperial College can
have their bikes security coded for
free next week. The coding will
take place in the Ante Room of the
Sherfield Building on the 13th,
14th, 17th and 18th February
between 10.00am and 4.00pm, with
a break from 12.30pm until
2.00pm.
The coding will be performed by
PCs Clive Coleman and Duncan
Law, Community Police Officers,
who commented that cycle coding
combined with use of D-locks
deterred cycle thieves.
Stress
The College Health Centre intends
to set up 'examination stress
workshops' next term. Although
they say that some stress is
unavoidable, such as around
examinations, people who feel they
are parituclarly prone should
contact the Health Centre. If there
is sufficient interest, workshops will
again be held.
The Health Centre is located at
14 Princes Gardens and patients are
reminded they are entitled to see
their medical records.
Audit
The Academic Audit Unit was set-
up last year by the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals to
monitor the ability of the country's
academic institutions to fulfill their
responsibility of maintaining
academic standards. It is intended
that the unit will visit each
institution every three years and so
far fourteen locations have been
audited.
Imperial College has not yet been
visited. (T/ie Independent)
Women
Students at Somerville College,
Oxford, are arranging protests
against the decision to allow men to
join. The all-female college will
cease to be single sex as of next
year. Somerville students reacted
with 'anger, shock and dismay' to
the news, according to The
Guardian. Five years ago, a college
referendum decided against
becoming mixed. (The Guardian)
