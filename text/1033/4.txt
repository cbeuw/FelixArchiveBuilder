Computer thefts, campaigning, the NUS, KCLSUand the mysterious CVCR...
A u n i n d y a S i n h a r a y , staunchnewsteam member, takes a lastlook at the issues that
excited and dismayed Imperial during the 1994/95 session.
I
mperial College (IC)
sauntered into another
academic year with the
news that Da Vinci's
ceiling had sprung a leak; but
despite the good humour of
watching two sabbs plugging
the holes with their fingers,
more ominous news was
awaiting the first issue of the
term...
St.Mary's Medical School
had sauntered into financial
scandal when Cyril D'Souza, a
hospital cashier and self-
confessed gambler was found to
have personally spent more than
£600,000 of Mary's money. M r .
D'Souza was charged in February
1995 and was sentenced last
month to five years imprison-
ment.

A n y sauntering was quickly
reduced to inebriated staggering
as Fresher's Week went into
action, though with less than
amusing consequences. 'Over-
enthusiastic behaviour' occurred
at the New Year Carnival when
about thirty of the freshers
decided to share the stage with
one of the Bands performing in
the Union Ents lounge.
The new first years were
clearly going to be more of a
handful than was thought.
Within days, one had provided a
test of Beit Hall's Fire Alarms
after smoking dope. H i s sub-
sequent caution and fine only
hinted at the unsalubrious
activities that Beit Quad would
host later in the year.

No sooner does IC announce its
intended merger with the
National Heart and L u n g
Institute than it also seems to
have become a member of the
'Russell Group', a clutch of elite
universities whose high-ranking
denizens skulked secretively in a
hotel of the same name.
Consisting of the likes of Oxford,
Cambridge, University College
London and the London School
of Economics (and us, of course)
the Russell Group 'broke away' to
form a 'superleague' of colleges,
raising fears that
they were intent
on claiming the
best students
and research
contracts. B u t
said S i r D a v i d
Williams, chan-
cellor of Cam-
bridge U n i v e r -
sity: "there is no
superleague and
none envisaged...
we are an infor-
mal group with
similar interests, set up for the
protection of the research
strengths of leading universities."
It subsequently emerged that the
Russellers actually first rode out
from IC itself, under the lead of
Sir E r i c A s h . B u t Imperial's
current rector, S i r Ronald
Oxburgh, was keen to downplay
the story, saying that sensational
journalism had exaggerated the
whole affair. A l l the group aimed
to do, said Sir Ronald, was to
demonstrate the merits of the
present system of selective
funding by lobbying politicians
and the like.

The acquisition of the National
Heart & Lung Institute was only
the first i n host of transplants
planned for the next few years.
The next phase would involve
St.Mary's merging with Charing
Cross & Westminster Medical
School, along with the Royal
Postgraduate Medical School.
The results of these mergers
would require the construction of
a Basic M e d i c a l Sciences
building, next to the Chemistry
department.
The BMS project, originally
costed at £72m, was then
downsized to £62m. T h e
involvement of medical students
opened the possibility of funding
from the Department of Health;
the medical section would be
financed 100% by external
sources, and H E F C E would fund
25% of the Biology section, an
extra £12m coming from IC itself.
In pure money terms, no hassles.
But would that be the whole
story? Not only would there be
an extra 1000 students on the
South Kensington site, there are
also the required leisure and
accommodation facilities to
consider as well. Part of the 'Old
Chemistry' department - featur-
ing some very o l d panelled
lecture theatres, the RCSU office
and the R C S Motor Club - is
physically in the way too. The
solution: Demolition. "But we
will re-house them somewhere,"
assured the Estates D i v i s i o n .
With H E F C E sure to refuse the
construction of replacement
lecture theatres, whilst other
theatres in college run way under
capacity, chemists being lectured
in other departments seems a real
possibility. A l l Estates would say
was that studies were in progress
to see what could be done to
remedy the situation.
The R C S U could be
officeless, their motor club left
garageless and chemists could be
left lecture theatreless; to some
the whole scheme seemed utterly
mindless. Many were decidedly
unimpressed with the project's
organisation, or lack thereof. Dr.
B r i a n L e v i t t of Chemistry,
considering the lecture lecture
problem, sarcastically muttered:
" A l l this is a brilliant example of
planning."
Still, come May, £20m was
promised mysteriously from
H E F C E for the B M S building:
odd because they never formally
declared any funding. Virginia
Bottomley, the Secretary of State
for H e a l t h , announced the
funding i n a press release. But
IC's Planning Division sought to
downplay suggestions that all the
money was i n the pipeline,
insisted it still depended on the
Department of Health producing
£20m. We clearly have a long way
to go.

A n d there's more (Sensation-
alism? Us?). The student union
at L S E set up what it called the
' A l d w y c h G r o u p ' to protect
students interests in Sir David's
non-existent superleague -
including union officials from
IC, L S E and other (yes...) 'elite'
universities. Their first meeting
was held at I C on the 1st
November. But, to complicate
things further, a more-elite-than-
elite group had emerged within
the elite superleague of elites. Sir
Ronald admitted that the vice-
