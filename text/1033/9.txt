Constant Monitoring
Big Brother is watching
you...
An influx of new technology seen
in recent months has meant that
security are in a position to
monitor student activity more than
ever before. The installation of a
network of alarms and cameras
has lead to allegations that a so-
called Big Brother system is being
created.
The whole system of swipe
cards was specifically introduced
so that they could also operate as
library cards, for cashless catering,
student voting or in association
with the sports centre. In Mr
Reynolds words: "it was almost a
smart card." But he insisted that
the constant monitoring of student
activity through the cards is some
way off: "it won't be done, or not
while I've got any say in it."
Security do not keep records on
students and apart from using
data for major investigations, all
information is dumped after seven
days, he insists. Nonetheless, Terry
Briley, his Deputy Head, has
voiced enthusiasm for the creation
of a 'rogue's gallery' of offenders
to keep track of errant students.
But Keith Reynolds dis-
missed the idea of a 1984 type
scenario insisting that he is not "a
great believer in putting cameras
all over the place for no real
reason". He admits that he gets
more requests from departments
for closed circuit surveillance than
he thinks are appropriate.
New technology
PIRs and dope-loving
smoke detectors
Recent months have seen a
massive up-grade in IC security
facilities. With the introduction
of new technology, staff can be
freed to react to incidents rather
than wait for them to happen.
But the benefits that the
high-tech equipment brings are
questioned by some security staff,
who point out that for a camera
to be of any use i n crime
detection, somebody has to
constantly look at the television
monitor. This problem will be
combated w i t h a new camera
soon to be installed on the
walkway, which will be coupled
with an Passive Infra-Red (PIR)
detector so that movement would
activate it.
But the reliability of the
new PIRs is in doubt after the
system failed to work just weeks
after it was installed. M r
Reynolds admits that the new
PIRs in the William Penney Lab
didn't trigger, despite an outside
window being broken and
various computer equipment
being tampered with. Describing
the incident as a 'malfunction'
the head of security insists that
this does not happen very often
and that all the defective
equipment was 'dumped'.
T h e new smoke alarms
continue to be a cause of conten-
tion. Introduced under govern-
ment regulations, their instal-
lation was plagued with problems
regarding their oversensitivity.
Now students are complaining
that their ability to detect can-
nabis smoke over-intrudes into
the private lives of hall residents.
While P C Coleman insists that
the public smoking of 'herbal
drugs' w i l l be prosecuted, he
suggests that the police are not
interested in private consump-
tion. "Whatever you do behind
closed doors is your business," he
said, insisting that it was up to
college, and hall wardens i n
particular, to deal w i t h the
discovery of small amounts.
Besides, M r Reynolds
thinks that the new fire detection
equipment has had little to do
with the twenty-five drug
discoveries of recent weeks. He
says that the network of smoke
alarms have only once resulted in
the seizure of illicit substances,
and that most of those found
have been caught out by staff.
Staff
'Some are old, hard of
hearing and they can't run'
Some students have problems
believing that security are
physically up to the job: many of
IC security staff were originally
employed to deliver mail before
the job of 'messenger' was
changed to 'security guard' three
years ago. "Some are old, hard of
hearing, and they can't run," one
student commented. In one case
earlier this year an intruder was
escorted by a postgraduate stu-
dent to a manned security lodge,
at w h i c h point the c r i m i n a l
escaped.
M r Reynolds admits that
some of the original messengers
may not have fully adapted to
their present role as security
officers. But he defends his staff:
"they have come a long way down
the new road and are quite good."
H e suggests that the mobile
response unit, always available to
react to incidents and containing
the younger, fitter elements,
should be able to cover any
possible staff inadequacy.
M r Reynolds also supports
the current m i n i m u m staffing
levels, insisting that a twelve man
team can staff the four fixed
points and 'put i n a good
patrolling system'. Justifying the
staff levels, the head of security
contends that a night shift of
sixteen Imperial College Security
guards is considerably more
personnel than Belgravia police
station has to cover the whole of
their sector.
The overhaul of security
staffing in 1992 came after pro-
posals to contract out the system
were defeated by a concerted
programme of industrial action,
and M r Reynolds still insists that
the present security staff provide
the best service. Although some
short term financial advantage
could be achieved by putting the
service out to tender, the rapid
turnover of personnel that would
inevitably result would present a
serious problem, he maintains.
With staff continuity being stres-
sed, it seems that IC Security are
safe, for the foreseeable future at
least, from any more attempts to
close them down.
