News Review
chancellors of the B i g Five do
still 'occasionally' meet, and even
scoffed at the idea of some sort of
Ivy League being set up; just as
well, as it appeared that the elite
(sigh) Aldwych group were start-
ing to voice their own concerns,
asking whether such a group was
"morally acceptable".

Other student problems seem to
fade into insignificance against a
backdrop of Islamic F u n d a -
mentalism sweeping L o n d o n
Colleges. One group was reported
to have distributed anti-homo-
sexual and anti-semitic leaflets in
and around U L U . A t K i n g ' s
College London's Fresher's Fair
another group was asked to leave
when it was discovered they were
religious activists of H i z b u
Tahrir ('Liberation Party').
These events prompted the
U L U council to pass a motion
reinforcing its "stance against
bigotry and prejudice from any
source" and effectively pro-
h i b i t i n g the d i s t r i b u t i o n of
potentially offensive literature.
The national organiser of one
group had told the national press
that they had control of about
fifty Islamic Societies nationwide
and had amassed some 2000
members.
A week after
the U L U ban, an
i n c i d e n t
occurred at the
School of Orien-
tal and African
Studies (SOAS).
The chair of the
Islamic Society
(and H i z b u
Tahrir member)
reportedly paid
tribute to an
M u s l i m suicide
bomber causing
mittee to ban all speakers from
the group. Another incident
occurred at K C L where it
appeared that members of a
rather vaguely titled 'Culture
Society' intended to disrupt a
meeting of the Jewish Society.
"The disturbing atmosphere of
the meeting led to the decision to
call the Police," said K C L S U .
Earlier, a member of IC's
own Islamic Society had said of
Hizb u Tahrir, "They are often
quoted out of context," after
insisting that "they not anti-
semitic or homophobic". In
much the same way, perhaps, as
Sir David Williams' Superleague
was non-existent...

With IC improving its links with
universities in other countries -
notably T h a i l a n d - it seemed
ironic that the Foreign Office
could soon be turning away
students from politically sen-
sitive countries. In an attempt to
halt the proliferation of dan-
gerous military hardware over-
seas, especially nuclear weapons,
students from ten countries could
find themselves being vetted by
the Government before being
allowed to study in the U K .
Dr. John Hassard of Physics
was critical of the scheme,
believing that it was 'racist' and
that the U K was effectively
telling other countries that they
weren't responsible enough to
have nuclear weapons. But
despite the scheme's appearance
as an attempt to fix the stable
door after the postdoc had bolted,
to others the heavy-handed
diplomacy seems justified. The
Iraqi Nuclear Weapons Program
was set up by an ex-IC researcher
a SOAS corn-
sufficiently offensive. Depicting
the Moors Murderers collecting
for a children's charity, it bore
the title 'Doing it for the kids'
whilst the highlight inside were
photographs of bizarrely mutil-
ated genitalia. It was banned by
U L U president Gemma
Williams, who said that IC Rag
would not be allowed to
distribute it on their premises;
in 1979, and is currently headed
by a former IC student.
D O I N G WHAT F O R

IC's infamously indecent Rag
Mag provoked a storm of protest
when it was published i n
November. Even the Rag chair
Ian Robertson admitted:
"Personally, I feel very offended
by it."
The front cover alone was
w i t h i n a week it had been
shunned by the unions of
Goldsmith's, Royal Holloway and
Bedford, the L S E and K C L . But
the widespread cold-shouldering
probably did Rag a favour. That
same week the medical schools of
St Guy's, St. Thomas's and
St.George's were screaming out
for copies.

The beleaguered Student Loans
Company ( S L C ) , by now
seasoned in the art of stumbling
ineptly into the spotlight for all
the wrong reasons, once again
found itself i n the news. A
confidential D F E document was
leaked to the Guardian detailing
the proposed privatisation of the
S L C . The Committee of Vice-
Chancellors and Principals was
unrelenting i n their fierce
disapproval of the S L C , saying
that the repayment mechanism
was wrong: "If the Government
had got the repayment scheme
right in the first place, the banks
would have taken it."
A few weeks later the S L C
had a new Chief Executive. Sir
Eric Ash, a former Rector of IC
and a non-Executive S L C
director since September 1994,
was drafted i n to head the
troubled company. T h e S L C
chairman told F E L I X : " H i s
management experience will be
an invaluable asset."
Soon Sir E r i c , an avid
proponent of e-mail at Imperial,
had put the S L C on the Internet.
T h i s great b i d for student
equality allowed technohippies
and cyberpunks to 'flame' the
SLC as easily as anyone else. Just

A postdoc had
his jacket and
wallet stolen,
with onlookers
s u s p e c t i n g
three males
who were later
confronted by
a technician in
the Q u a d ; a fight ensued i n
w h i c h all six u n i o n stewards
attempted to subdue the pro-
tagonists, after which four of the
stewards required hospital treat-
ment. The resulting deficiency of
stewards meant that staff from a
private security company would
be deployed in their place.
There were also allegations
of an IC security officer drinking
whilst on duty. Security said that
two officers had been on duty
that night; certain eye-witnesses
claimed that only one officer was
seen. Terry Briley, Deputy Head
of Security, said he was shocked
at the notion of security men
drinking on the job.
And there was more doubt
over when police had been called,
and whether Security sent for
them when the stewards had
asked. It was also unclear why
Security - though attending to
the injured - had not been
further involved at an earlier
stage. Security felt that, as the
police had been contacted as soon
as the violence started, then it
was the police whose actions
should be scrutinised.
Police actually appeared on
the scene at 3am, after the three
assailants had left the fray; so if
the police had been slow in their
reaction, then the actions of the
security guards were above
criticism in this regard. Right?
