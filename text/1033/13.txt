This year, Imperial's chemistry
department celebrates its 150th
birthday. Connected with the
event is a move to commemorate
the department's first professor,
August Wilhelm Hofmann, by
(putting up a blue plaque on
I the house he lived in during 20
I years in London,
j Hofmann was born in the
: German town of Giessen,
famous for its school of organic
chemistry. He originally studied
philosophy and law, but realised his mistake and
enrolled instead to study chemistry.
Hofmann's great interest was IN the com-
ponents of coal tar, a byprod-
small square chamber connected with the chim-!
ney flue. There were no stink closets except the:
covered part of a large sand-bath heated with \
coke". i.
Although the College was highly respected,
it found its industrial sponsors uneasy at the
prospect of a long wait for j
applicable results. In 1 853, j
lacking funds, it was absorbed \
by the Royal School of Mines,
Which amalgamation later j
became Imperial College. J
Despite his acade-
mic achievements, Hofmann's true talent was as
a teacher and enthuser in chemistry. A student:
wrote: "Hofmann had a marvellous power of
stimulating his students and of
uct of the coal gas industry | n 1 8 5 3 , h e b e c a m e director imparting to them his own

Chemistry, which later
rivers. In the mid 1800's,
! Hofmann showed that several
ingredients of coal tar were
related to ammonia. This
j seemingly esoteric feat inspired very practical
advances in the dyeing industry. Compounds
^classified by Hofmann were later used in the
• production of red, mauve, blue
i and violet dyes.
Meanwhile in Britain,
Henry de la Beche and others
were pushing for a chemistry
j college, and Hofmann was rec-
ommended to oversee Britain's
I first College of Chemistry. After overcoming ini-
itial uncertainties about English life, he stayed in
i London for 20 years.
The College's laboratories,
set up in rooms on Oxford
Street, were somewhat rudi-
mentary. A student of
Hofmann's wrote later: "the
first public laboratory I worked
in was the Royal College of
Chemistry in Oxford Street in 1853 to 1856. This
I was very different to our present one, the appli-
; ances being few. We had to make our H2S in a

Soon Hofmann may be
remembered for all of
London through a blue
plaque on his house
in Fitzroy Square.
ment for even the most routine I
experiments, Hofmann even
managed to eulogise about
batteries: " A faithful hand-
maid, the voltaic battery multiplies for us, in I
durable metal, the noblest productions of artistic!
genius". }
As a teacher, j
Hofmann had reservations^
about the specialisation in 1
education which remains?
today: "the object... is to pre- i
vent cramming in one special i
subject and utter ignorance in f
all the rest of science". His lectures were attend-
ed several times by the forward-looking Prince
Albert, and he was summoned to explain to
Queen Victoria about the dyes
he had helped create. \
August Hofmann is
commemorated for Imperial:
College through the Hofmann \
Chair for Chemistry, currently
held by Emeritus Professor
Charles Rees. Soon Hofmann may be remem-
bered for all of London through a blue plaque
on his residence in Fitzroy Square, W l . 1
