The barcode system seen on all prod-
ucts was first introduced in
the code. Next write the oddly placed
digits in a list and the evenly placed
ones in a second one. Add up both
lists, multiply the odd list by three and
add rt to the even list. To get the check

tems such as library books.
Each has twenty-six bars ond
spaces surrounded and
bisected by three further
pairs. The numbers they rep-
resent are printed below the bars, with
one notable omission. Here's how they
work:
1. The first two numbers give the
country of origin - in England's cose it's
50.
2. The following five
figures identify the
manufacturer.
3. The following five
are an arbitrary code
allocated by the manu-
facturer to indentify the
commodity, including
its size.

bit. The remaining

Each number of the code is
represented by two bars ond
two spaces, each of which
con be one to four units thick,
but the complete number is
always eight units wide. The
bars need to be readable from both
directions, so the bst six numbers have
their bars inverted, allowing the scanner
to tell which side of the code it is read
ing.
The scanner needs some way of detect
ing where to start and
stop and where the con
