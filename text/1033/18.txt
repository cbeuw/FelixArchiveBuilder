F E L I X 1032
A seamless soundscape of
cybernetic cool with
samples from 'aliens' and
'repomon' serving as the
vocabulary;, meaning disappears
over the event horizon and you're
left simply to sink into sensation.
This is music in its truest, purest
sense.

This is a young album,
which is as full of
swaggering rock as instru-
mental wit as nervous energy. The
first time you let it go, Whammm!

Thorn's dangerously quiet
falsetto is swathed in six
string barbs. There are few
rhyming couplets; these songs are
twisted stories from a suffering
soul, a continuation of the angst
of their millstone 'creep' - finally
being laid to rest.

Their trick is that although
songs like 'best friends
arm' and 'brinx job' veer
close together, they remain
distinct. Partly it's because
Pavement ignore the traditional
niceties of verse-chorus-verse and
so they can crash out, kick in
overdrive guitars or even the odd
harmonica to redirect the melody
wherever they change their mind.
Partly it's the simple fact that
Pavement are one of the best
bands playing around today.

Clerks is a major achiev-
I k l ement for debut director
Kevin Smith. Shot in a
slackeresque grainy 16mm black
and white, it's fast paced, well
rehearsed and has hard hitting
dialogue. And all for an overall
budget of under $30,000.

movie cultists and techno-
phreaks. The rest of us will find it
interesting, funny in parts and
technically superb but then we'll
go back and cry over Edward

"It lives" is the glorious cry
A which marks the fulfilment
of Frankenstein's alche-
mistical search. And amidst the
boiling flasks and copper tubing
Branagh's portrayal of Victor
Frankenstein carries us on in the
breathless imperative of results
without responsibility.

Opening with one of the
• > 1 most innovative and
^^•^ original opening sequences
for a long time, the film is shot in
black and white which allows Tim
Burton to recreate his typical
gothic, brooding visual style. With
an often very amusing script, it
moves along at a fairly sedate
pace and although it runs slightly
longer than needed, nevertheless
it never ceases to be engaging.
