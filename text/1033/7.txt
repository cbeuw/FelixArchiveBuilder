News Review
raid could have been equally bad
were it not for another student
who confronted and pursued the
thieves, one of whom escaped
through a ground-floor
maintenance area. The other
headed for the security lodge at
the main door, and broke out
through the double front doors
and onto Queensgate.
Less than a fortnight into
the summer term, the W i l l i a m
Penney Laboratory on the
Sherfield Walkway was struck,
though this time the amount
taken and the damage caused was
small - the one computer stolen
was described by Dr. Jonathan
Lever as 'obsolete'.
Further problems were
caused, when infra-red detectors
installed to cover high-risk areas
were set off by DoC's own staff.
On one occasion the alarm
sounded seven times in a single
evening, making the Linstead
Hall fire alarms seem positively
tongue-tied in comparison. The
Physics department was also hit
in a raid which damaged eight
machines. "They're making the
place like Fort Knox," a security
guard commented. Perhaps it's
about time.
T H E K I N G ' S M E N
Chasing around London nabbing
bits of metal and masonry
belonging to other college's
unions is taken surprisingly
seriously by some. In December
an R C S U mascotry team libe-
rated 'Reggie', K C L ' s stone lion
mascot. But though i n i t i a l l y
dismissive of the I 1
loss of the mas-
cot, it appeared
that K C L S U
actually tacitly
approved a rev-
enge attack by
their students on
IC's U n i o n Bar
in February.
F o u r t e e n
K C L students
m i n i - b u s s e d
their way to
South K e n -
sington, entered the Traditional
Bar (where the Stone L i o n had
often been sighted...) and
liberated several bottles of
alcohol and a number of
tankards. But attempting to
escape, they found the exit
locked. They then attempted to
kick the door down in their bid
for freedom, four of them being
caught i n the process. The
damage caused was estimated at
Â£2000.
Ghassan K a r i a n , K C L S U
President, hastily distanced
himself from the affair, calling
mascotry 'toss', despite the fact
he'd shown interest in it earlier
in the year. He claimed that the
incident was 'Imperial's fault'
after the initial attack by the RCS
students. He denied any involve-
ment of K C L S U , any prior
knowledge of the attack and any
use of the K C L S U minibus. The
possibility of pressing charges
existed as the offenders had been
caught on security cameras.
There was an added
dimension - some felt that
President and Labour councillor
Karian was merely protecting his
own interests lest his image be
damaged in his campaign for the
U L U presidency. But a week
later he issued a full confession,
saying that he'd k n o w i n g l y
misled I C U and F E L I X . He'd
known about the use of the
K C L S U minibus in the attack,
that the offenders had targeted
IC, and he even confirmed that
he'd handed over the keys
himself. He apologised for the
"collective decision to cover the
fact that our minibus was used".
Yet he denied lying
personally to F E L I X about the
incident, stressing the 'collective
decision'. Asked whether or not
the affair could affect his
campaign to become U L U
the reporter present.
president, he replied " W h y
should it?" Elected to the U L U
Presidency in early March, he
told U L U General Council that
he would occasionally tell 'fibs'.
The previously media
friendly Karian refused to talk to
A N D F I N A L L Y . . .
Of course this is but an
impressionistic view of the
Imperial's news year - lots of
broad strokes with plenty of local
colour. But what lies beyond the
edge of our limited canvas?
One potentially worrisome
issue for I C U is the fact that
come 1998 it could be relocated
into the Sherfield Building. But
the provisional plans provided by
the Estates division were found
wanting by I C U ; the proposed
3rd floor U n i o n Bar would be
very small, and it seemed
unlikely that the Traditional Bar
could be transferred to the new
premises 'panel by panel' as
originally hoped. There'd also be
the problem of whether I C U
catering would be able to
compete with that of College.
A c c o r d i n g to D a n L o o k , a
referendum on the proposed
move was "not something we
would rule out."
Crime proved a major prob-
lem throughout the year, starting
with signs and doormats going
missing from I C U in October,
vending machines and car radios
vanishing and arcade machines
being raided i n H a l l s . Some
offenders proved less adept than
others - a two-man crimewave
ground to a halt after it got lost
in the Electrical Engineering
Department.
T h e Overseas Societies
Committee finally managed to
assemble a committee with which
to begin the year, though the
run-up to International Night
was dogged with all manner of
problems, plagued with infight-
ing and JapanSoc boycotting the
event in protest of the handling
of the event by Andreas Mershin,
OSC Chair. T h e M a r c h event
actually turned out to be a sell-
out success with
Mershin saying
that he "didn't
expect it to go so
well." By the end
of the term
differences had
been resolved.
A n o t h e r
fight, another
venue: The
Queen's L a w n
played host to a
~^ brawl between
staff and
technicians after a dispute in the
Holland Club just before Christ-
mas. There have been several
calls for more responsible con-
sumption of alcohol this year,
particularly in the wake of the
Beit fights, where a security
guard was attacked in January.
As if the NUS and Sabbatical
elections were certainly enough,
others took place around college
and received varying degrees of
disinterest. The C & G elections
came and went with a depres-
singly low number of people
noticing and even fewer caring.
The R C S and R S M elections
occurred with a slightly larger
turnout, but all three led to much
debate on the future of the CCUs
at South Kensington.
F o u r t h year Aero exam
papers went missing, allowing
the students to put their feet up
for a while as their exams got
postponed. The examinations did
eventually take place, but if the
summer exam papers had gone
missing the ensuing chaos would
have been horrific. "I don't know
what you'd do then, jump out of
the window or something," com-
mented the Head of Aeronautics,
Professor P. W . Bearman. With
the summer term free of flattened
Aeronautical professors adorning
the pavements, we can only
surmise that things have run
smoothly in exam-land. 13

The FELIXnews team wishes
all their regular readers an enjoyab
