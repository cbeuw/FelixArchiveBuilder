My favourite places in London are
the places I go to leave her from.
Paddington station, with its
caterpillered grey-grimed-glass
vaulted roof and its ghostly
Victorian trains that still pull in and
smoke the air with breathless
steam; Westway carpeting
magically out over houses and
lives, past the arks of the
corporations to the promising
refuge of the barren M4 corridor;
the Grand Union C a n a l , the
industrial artery which I'll chug out
of here on one day; Heathrow, its
ridiculous passenger handling
facilities in my mind sellotaped
onto the side of the enormous
concept of leaving here in a
moment (like the passanger
carrying compartments perched on
top of the dinosaurs in 'the
Flintstones'j; even Victoria Coach
Station and its Napoleon complex.
These are the places I love
most in London and the places I
return to again and again. Not
because I long to leave but
because I long to arrive. I covet
the excitement, and I enjoy seeing
new, often temporary, Londoner's
disembark. With their heavy
proportion of non-metropolitans,
these modern day Border Marches
provide a far more immediate and
accessible interface to the
relationship between London and
the lands she rules over than the
slow watering down of a trip to
the edge of the endless suburbs.
If I were rich I'd like to leave
London in a private helicopter. Air
traffic control would be the special
sound of my favourite place,
together with the noise and taste
of the wind rushing past the
roughly sealed window with the
force of a speeding brick. The city
would spread out beneath me like
like the computer graphics that
are periodically used before
'London Tonightesque' television
programmes and the whole city
would be allowed to qualify as my
favourite place.
It's Friday 7.00am on June
16th and I've been up all night
editing news reviews and writing
fanciful columns to my short-lived
wandering past. I would like right
now to feel a little queasy in one
of my places, because it's so early
and because I don't drink coffee
and so am forced to have an early
morning coke. I'd like to be
watching the night-people and
day-dwellers mix and I'd like to be
going and returning.
Like most of Earth's people,
my roots migrated to the city, and
its gates are precious to me. 0
Last time pavement came to play,
it was a wash out. Slackers by
nature, they seemed ill at ease
onstage and proceeded to muffle
their way through one of the worse
gigs I've seen. Last week at Brixton
Academy it was a different tune; all
hail the conquering heroes as
Pavement returned upmarket and
blew away all our expectations.
Songs from current album,
'wowee zowee', were spliced with
more than the odd one or two from
'crooked rain crooked rain' -
Stephen J. Malkmus choosing to
open with the anthemic 'silence
kit'. "Your sister cursed, your
father's only damned now," he
sang and it summed up both the
band's inherent meaning, or was
that absurdity? 'Fight this genera-
tion' was another case in question.
Happy to singalong, we weren't
sure whether we were indicting
ourselves and we sure didn't care
either.
Perhaps they played too few of
the new ones and relied too much
on singles like 'cut your hair' and
'heaven is a truck' (excluding the
line about the Smashing Pumpkins
but with added AC/DC instead!)
but these were so good, such
criticism smacks of churlishness.
They finished, far too soon, with the
ancient 'summer babe' before
coming back as the wacky
Pavement of old.
Drummer Steve West swapped
places with Stephen J, second
drummer-come-madman Bob put a
random face mask on and the
recombined band staggered into
action with such misplaced
enthusiasm you had to smile. For a
couple of songs they even looked
like they were enjoying it as much
as the audience.
It must be weird being soul
a s y l u m . One minute you're
nobodies, barely breaking even
after twelve years then you're
releasing your seventh Ip. It's more
polished, yet still full of great songs
and it contains one about
runaways; the best song Tom Petty
could never write. Next minute
you're on mtv so much you're tired
of seeing your own face, the Ip's
selling in millions and the world is
preparing itself for the follow-up...
So, does it deliver? Pretty
much. Believe it or not, /et your dim
light shine is even more commercial
than 'grave dancers union' and it's
quite clear that Dave Pirner is far
lot more comfortable pretending to
be Tom Petty than he ever was
playing Bob Mould. 'Misery' is a
great opener, picking up where
they left off with a gentle refrain
and a soaring chorus. Elsewhere
the likes of 'shut down' and their
sole moment of punk asylum,
'caged rat', remind us that they can
still rock, while 'to my own devices'
remind us that they can chill too.
Personally, I would like to have
seen more of the former and less of
the latter but I guess the majority of
the hungry hordes wouldn't. Pirner
leaves us with a parting shot of 'I
did my best'. Hopefully, that's still
to come. (7)
If you're in need of cheering
up and want to listen to a feel-
good record then don't choose
paradise lost's draconian times. If
you can begin to contemplate what
Metallica would sound like if the
Sisters of Mercy wrote their songs
then you're some way to knowing
what this record sounds like. In the
main they've weaved dark
tapestries built on huge guitar riffs
and enveloped in a dark, creeping
atmosphere. Recent single, 'the last
time', and 'shadowkings' are more
traditional chug-a-long metal
affairs but that menacing, almost
claustrophobic ambience still
pervades. An impressive, if depress-
ive, achievement. (7)
T h e r a p y ? ' s latest album,
infernal love, sees them in a
playfully ironic mode; at least on
the album cover. Sporting mon-
strously fake chin-pieces the band,
who have made their name mainly
as angst ridden indie thrashers,
appear to lighten up slightly. And
it's a situation which is reflected to
some degree on the album too as
current single and title track,
'stories', appeared surprisingly
weak to my delicate ears. As for
their orchestral version of Hiisker
Du's 'diane', the only creditable
response can be that they have to
be having a good laugh. (7)
The beastie boys - who'd
believe it, eh. Not too long ago
they were the scourge of VW
owners everywhere and now
they're respectable, even reputable,
purveyors of trump-pump-city-slang
to-a-rhyming-twang kinda music
(we think). Latest release on their
very own Grand Royale label, root
down ep is a mixed bag of ten
tracks. Three are remixes of title
track, which is a good bassy dive
but not really that good or bassy.
Most of the reminder are live
versions of tracks from last year's
'ill communication' album. It all
adds up to being a bit of a time
filler though. (5) 0
