didn't believe
that the first call
reported any
violence taking
place; as far as
they were concerned only a theft
was reported and so they didn't
feel an immediate response was
in order.
K e i t h Reynolds, head of
Imperial College Security, ad-
mitted that there may have been
'a bit of confusion' on 'both sides
of the fence.' However, he maint-
ained that nothing like this
would occur again.
US & T H E N U S
Do we, don't we, should we,
shouldn't we... one of the biggest
issues to be debated during the
year was whether I C U should
return to the National Union of
Students (NUS). The N U S itself
seemed willing, even eager, to
welcome back London's prodigal
college with open arms but many
students at Imperial were less
than enthusiastic.
Representatives from the
NUS courted I C U to explain the
benefits of re-affiliation, even
offering a knockdown affiliation
fee of £20,000 and an £11,000
saving on beer to coax the
Kensington campus back into the
fold. But that left a £9,000
shortfall - and there was also
concern that the N U S would
consider I C U 'a feather in their
cap' and that I C U ' s apolitical
stand would be sullied by
affiliation to a National Union
not renowned for its love of
incumbent governments.
A motion was presented to
council calling for a referendum.
It was defeated, but on a
technicality: it was feared that a
referendum would interfere with
the sabbatical elections which
were also due to take place in the
Spring term. Council was though,
in principle, in favour of the idea
F E L I X
of a referendum.
Which brings us around to.

Elections, elections everywhere
and lots and lots to drink - as
results night would show.
W i t h i n a week, gossip was
spreading over who was standing
for what, especially given that
four members of the Elections
Committee had resigned citing
conflict of interests. Papers went
up, and rumours began to
metamorphose into fact. Down
went the papers two weeks later,
with only one candidate running
unopposed.
A deluge of posters hit
college the following week, with
nine candidates chasing four
posts. Candidates advertised,
canvassed, campaigned, received
flans at M a r y ' s , advertised,
canvassed and campaigned.
Meanwhile a F E L I X opinion
poll showed a huge proportion of
students who were 'undecided'.
More advertising, canvassing and
campaigning - until to spoil it all
voting time arrived.
The final result seemed to
have been swung by the flanning
medics, provoking a storm of
controversy over Mary's voting.
It appeared that at the medical
school, 'sample voting slips' had
been found amongst the ballots,
indicative, perhaps, of a certain
confusion amongst the Mary's
voters.
The really dramatic voting
actually came a week later. At
I C U council, there was a real
possibility that the sabbs-elect
could get a post-election kick in
the ballots. It seemed clear that
in view of the way things had
gone at Mary's with the sample
ballot papers, the constitutional
rules governing the running of
elections had been broken.
A heated debate followed
and a vote was taken. Fifteen
members called for an electoral
re-run, fourteen against. But the
votes were re-counted, and one
member actually changed his
decision, causing a fourteen-vote
all draw. C o u n c i l chair John
Durrell had the casting vote and
manfully put everyone out of
their misery.
The results were valid: Sarah
White for President, Matt
Crompton for Deputy President
(Finance and Services), T i m
Townend for Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies) and Rachel
Walter returned as F E L I X
Editor and Print Unit Manager.
Which allowed us all to get
back to...
U S & T H E N U S (II)
With the sabbatical elections out
of the way, the end of the Spring
term finally saw the decision to
hold a vote on N U S affiliation.
Though a lot of students didn't
actually support joining, it was
clear that the student body felt
they should be allowed to make
the decision for themselves.
The Summer term saw
campaigning across college once
more. T h e a n t i - N U S lobby,
headed by Sarah Thomas,
campaigned mainly on the
financial implications to I C U as
well as the highly political nature
of N U S activity; the pro-NUS
campaign, led by Stephen Webb
and James Connolly fought their
corner on the benefits - financial,
legal and otherwise - that the
NUS could bring to the student
body. From the beginning there
was concern on where both sides
were getting money - speculation
was especially rife over how the
anti-camp were being funded.
Hustings were pathetically
attended and there were fears
that the whole election would not
be valid (quorate) through less
than the required 1000 students
could end up voting at all. To
make matters worse, the pro-
campaigners were accused of
using illegal posters w h i c h
carried no election dates on
them, and they started inviting
NUS staff to speak at hustings;.
Meanwhile the anti-
campaign were accused of not
actively encouraging people to
vote in an attempt to render the
election invalid, and so winning
their campaign passively. A l l the
same, the rule-flouting continued
- overlooked as it was deemed
' s i l l y ' to invalidate an entire
referendum purely because of a
technicality.
M o r e advertising, cam-
paigning, canvassing.... but the
whole affair seemed i n real
danger of soaring to fresh heights
of bumbling ineptitude. By the
time voting came round, it
seemed that the campaigns
together w i t h , perhaps, the
issue's continual prominence in
the F E L I X news pages, had led
to sufficient numbers turning out
for the election to be quorate.
Sure enough 965 voted to stay
outside the NUS, 696 voted to re-
enter.
Reactions were varied; "It
would be a great shame i f the
NUS had won in the light of the
campaign that was run," said
Deputy President D a n Look.
Sarah Thomas felt the whole
election had "turned into a farce"
and she was "relieved that it was
all over". O d d l y , 80% of the
medics wanted to re-join, with
one of them saying that cheaper
beer prices were a good incentive.

K C L , U C L and now IC's
Computing Department suffered
numerous break-ins throughout
the first half of 1995, suffering
thousands of pounds worth of
theft and damage. A n early
morning raid in February cost
college £30,000, though the
vigilance of postgraduate student
prevented further damage. Soon
another gang of professional
thieves struck, apparently
stealing on order. T h i s time
£8000 worth of R A M chips were
taken, with electrostatic damage
received by the machines
threatening to massively increase
the repair bill. The intruder was
caught but fled before security

Two further raids occurred
over Easter, with one criminal
being chased but escaping, and
