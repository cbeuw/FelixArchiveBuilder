Albertopolis Falls at the First Hurdle
Cash Crisis
BY R A C H E L W A L T E R S
The 'Albertopolis' proposal to
rejuvenate South Kensington has
been rejected by the Department
of National Heritage's
Millennium Fund. The ambit-
ious application for National
Lottery funding was not among
the 83 selected projects announ-
ced last Thursday.
The rejection is part of an
ongoing procedure to determine
which projects will gain a share
of the Commission's £1.6 billion
budget. The Albertopolis pro-
posal would have created a huge
pedestrian precinct and under-
ground shopping mall beneath
E x h i b i t i o n Road, connecting
prominent local museums with
Imperial College. But as M i k e
E l r i c h of the M i l l e n n i u m
Commission explained to
F E L I X , the planners: "were
unable to show us that it was the
best use of the M i l l e n n i u m
money, from both a financial and
technical point of view".
The Commission based its
choices on a stringent set of
criteria. Successful applicants
produced proposals that were
environmentally sound, of excep-
tional architectural quality and
likely to receive public backing.
Providing a lasting monument to
mark the m i l l e n n i u m was
another high priority. "Projects
have to show us that they cut the
mustard," M r Elrich said.
He emphasised that ideal
proposals were ones that would
be of genuine benefit to the
community. "They've got to
mean something to people," he
insisted. Many of the bids which
have been short-listed are based
around urban re-development
and recreation plans.
Further sets of proposals to
earn a slice of the National
Lottery winnings will be consi-
dered next September. Those
whose plans have been unsuccess-
ful are advised to go away and
rethink their schemes.
M r Elrich suggested that the
huge cost of the Albertopolis
proposal may have proved its
downfall. The scheme required a
sum of £100 m i l l i o n , but the
M i l l e n n i u m Commission has
only £350 million to distribute in
this round of awards. "They need
to scale it down a bit, and make it
more people orientated," he
advised.

A member of Imperial College
Union (ICU) staff has departed
under a cloud of suspicion, after
an estimated £7,000 has been
found missing from the Union
coffers. The affair has only just
been brought into the open,
following legal worries that
undue publicity might hinder
the expected criminal trial.
The staff member is alleged
to have started claiming small
amounts of extra overtime
during the previous academic
year. It was only in more recent
times that the part-time worker
appears to have undertaken large
scale deception.
There is some confusion as
to who should take responsibility
for allowing the apparent subter-
fuge to continue for up to nine
months, however. While over-
time sheets for Union employees
are authorised by the U n i o n
Manager, Mandy Hurford, wages
are actually paid out by College's
Pay Office.
The I C U employee was
contracted to work twenty five
hours a week, but is alleged to
