Who's watching your back?
Security issues were the basis for a large number of this year's news stories: from
drug dealing to computer thieving, Imperial College is increasingly home to
crime worries. With the help of local PC Clive Coleman and IC Head of
Security Keith Reynolds, Andrew Dorman-Smith looks at the conflict
between tightening up protection and clamping down on studentfreedom.
Swipe Cards
Security meets the
technology of the nineties
The swipe card - or 'Access
Control' - system was initiated in
1 992 in an attempt to 'control the
perimeter' of IC so that security
staff would be released to 'super-
vise the interior'. Instead of the
88-strong team responsible for
manning the front doors of every
building, only four lodges are now
permanently supervised, with the
rest of the staff expected to patrol
certain 'sectors'.
But security personnel admit
that the system isn't infallible. They

Keith Reynolds
IC Head of Security
Mr Reynolds was instrumental in
bringing through the 1992 reforms
and he says that the security service
has come on by 'leaps and bounds'.
Future security plans and
equipment upgrades will be
balanced against the college's
budgetary constraints. The head of
security said: "we can't go round
blithely robbing academic depart-
ments". Putting the present crime
rate in to perspective, Mr Reynolds
asserts that, "compared to other
London Colleges, we're laughing...
we're sitting on it pretty well".
He appealed for student help
in tackling crime: "please come and
tell us ... we're not here to make your
life difficult, we're here to help."
F E L I X
see 'piggy-backing' - the way in
which people without swipe cards
can simply follow authorised
students into buildings - as a
major problem. With few students
prepared to actually ask others for
identification the whole idea of
'controlling the perimeter' is being
put in doubt. Clive Coleman
suggests that students and staff
are perfectly entitled to ask those
following them in or out for proof
of identification, saying that the
police will deal severely with
anyone who objects to being
questioned.
Keith Reynolds insists that
the system is perfectly adequate: a
foolproof system of floor to ceiling
turnstiles would cost £ 1 . 3 million.
To support his view that 'piggy-
backing' isn't a problem, Mr
Reynolds asserts that the vast
majority of robberies which occur
during the swipe card system's
activation are as a result of forced
entry.
Safety
'Halls are a priority'
Halls of Residence are parti-
cularly susceptible to 'piggy-back'
entering, but when the original
reforms were introduced M r
Reynolds promised: " M y priority
is the students, especially those
living in halls". Some security
guards are known to favour
twentyfour hour manned security
lodges at the front door of each
hall, especially the large South-
side ones. Citing the attack on a
female fresher in her Linstead
bedroom two years ago, they
insist that the protection of
students would be improved with
a heightened security presence.
PC Coleman agrees with
this sentiment, suggesting that
the cost could be l i m i t e d by
employing students between 6pm
and midnight, for example, to
check IDs.
While M r Reynolds insists
that the overall 'crime and
incident rate' in halls is not that
bad, he asserts that under the
present staffing levels it is not
possible for security guards to be
posted at each door.
He is though attracted by
P C Coleman's suggestion of
having students on each door,
saying that it as 'a good idea'. But
he questioned where the money
for this could be found.
Clive Coleman
The Local Bobby
PC Coleman, the homebeat officer
of the Belgravia sector, spends a
large proportion of his time dealing
with Imperial affairs. In fact, it has
been reported that two thirds of
crime in the area happens at
Imperial. Clive runs crime pre-
vention weeks at IC twice each year
to raise awareness of the security
problem, where he marks students
bicycles with a security code to act as
a theft deterrent.
