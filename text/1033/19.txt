Perhaps Oliver Stone
MbmjB should take time out, hold
his breath, count to fifty
and then sit down to watch quiz
show. He might learn a thing or
two. The point is that you don't
need to overblow the media to
send it up; they do it for you and
have done so ever since the first
black and white pictures flickered
across the bakelite box.
'Cos the heart of Quiz Show's
message is that America lost its
innocence long before Jack
Kennedy lost the back of his head.

Amateur is every bit as
yL_jfl| funny as Hal Hartley's
previous work, while the
action scenes are also well-
handled. But the real attraction is
the compellingly realised
relationships between the main
characters.

The exuberance of all the
I k J characters lifts this film
from being 'another Woody
Allen film' to a hilariously funny
film. In particular Dianne Wiest
has one of the most memorable
roles. It's undeniable, Woody
Allen is back on track.

In the land populated by
(|bmJÂ§ beautiful plastic surgeons,
symbolically driven dreams
and slowly narrating Japanese
shrinks, Suture may slow down but
it retains its sure progression to a
nicely twisted end.

The consistency of this
album is underpinned by
the presence of a band, not
just an individual.
The downwards rhythm
progression of 'hazing' is perhaps
the singular example but you get
the impression that the slow
swagger of 'teller' and force of 'no
way in hell' will give an equally
good return with persistent listen-
ing as the more accessible tracks.
Perhaps the overall moral to
accept is don't live in the past. The
Throwing Muses are dead. Long
live the Throwing Muses.

I didn't want to eulogise.
But, after listening to this,
I'm afraid that it's
impossible not to. This is Nirvana
as we had never heard them
before (and sadly will never hear
them again).

Vocals are relegated to
the status of 'just another
instrument'; although for
Mercury Rev that's the highest
state of grace. Lyrical sense is not
their talisman. Moods are
important, feelings never die; this
is music to inspire.

Ira's voice still drones,
Georgia occasionally takes
vocal control with shy
confidence, but the group's driving
force remains their love of some
good guitar reverberation and
semi-inane odd-ball attitude.
