Imperial College Security have now admitted that the newly installed passive
infra-red (PIR) detectors in the Department of Computing failed during a
raid on the William Penney Lab two weeks ago, writes Rachel Walters.
They had earlier claimed that the system functioned perfectly when two youths
broke into the research area in the early hours ofJune 2nd ( F E L I X 1032). It
now appears that although the break-in was unsuccessful, it was only
prevented due to the vigilance of a nearby security guard. Security gave chase,
and two suspects were subsequently arrested.
Keith Reynolds, Head of Security, explained: "fortuitously one of our
guys happened to be on the Chem Eng walkway system and heard the glass
go, so he radioed and we were there probably nearly as damn quick as if the
PIR had gone anyway."
Previously, Terry Briley, Deputy Head of Security, had told FELIX
that the successful handling of the incident was due to the PIR detectors. He
had said that he was encouraged that the new security measures were proving
to be effective.

Well done Mark!
Imperial College U n i o n (ICU)
staff have been full of praise for
M a r k H o m e , this year's new
Ent's Manager, after the sell-out
success of last Friday's end of
term carnival. I C U looks likely to
make up to £1500 from the
night's festivities: " O f course, it
will all be ploughed right back in
to provide even better student
services," Mark stressed.
The transformation of the

big hit, and helped the Union to
pack in 1250 punters, the
maximum legal capacity of the

came as the clock approached
3am. Smoke detectors set the fire
alarms off and the revellers had to

Well done Bob!
Imperial biologist Robert M a y
has been appointed as the
Government's new Chief
Scientific Adviser. Professor May,
59, is a Royal Society research
professor who divides his time
between the zoology department
of Oxford and our own institute
of pure and applied biology at
Silwood Park.
The government position,
which includes heading up the
Office of Science and
Technology, will see Professor
May reporting directly to the
Minister for Science. He will also
be charged with coordinating the
activities of all the other chief
scientists in each of the relevant
government departments.

The much vaunted new Basic
Medical Science (BMS) building,
planned to be completed by April
1998, faces further delays in the
approval of the £40million public
sector contribution to its
funding. It had been hoped that
full approval would have been
gained by Easter, especially given
two senior cabinet ministers'
public support for the project.

up to thirty nine hours extra
overtime. With I C U paying for
the wages of the employee's

It was when the overtime
sheets were checked, just before
Easter, the discrepancies were
uncovered. F E L I X understands

St Mary's Hospital M e d i c a l
School is a shining example of
medical research, according to the
new Committee of Vice

report. 'Universities and the
Health of the Nation' presses for
continuing investment in the staff
and resources of medical schools

innovations.
The Department of

On the question of whether a

RCS enter Forbidden Land
The impending demolition of
RCSII has raised a problem for
Royal College of Science Union,
as their hallowed office is
contained within its walls. The
soon to be displaced souls that are
the RCS hacks will now be in the
unfortunate position of spending
most of their time in a City and
Guilds building.
The new C C U office, and the
garage of the fire engine Jez, are
to be in the Department of Civil
Engineering but it seems that
College didn't give them much of
an option. Apparently it was
either take what was offered or it
would be presumed that the RCS
no longer required office space.
