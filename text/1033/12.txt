The building site two doors down
from my house screams into life at
8 every morning and doesn't go
back to sleep until 6. Dozens of
men are engaged i n stripping out
the insides of a listed build-
ing, while holding up the
outsides w i t h enormous,
crane-constructed scaffold-
ing. It's been going on for
months, and is bound to be
finished the day I move out.
L o n d o n ' s obsession w i t h
preserving appearances
seems commendable to all except those who live
within earshot. The history of the city is remark-
able, not least because of the number of famous
people who have been born, lived, stayed or died
How did you get the job of chairman of the bl

Well, I'm not a historian, I was a merchant b

It was 1901 when they ceased to be involved
any involvement with it at all since
then. We certainly do try and balance
the professions, but one of our crite- ./^Slm

a lot of scientists, but I think that

What are the other criteria for a

Blue plaques are one way of preserving the
city's unique qualities. These round, ceramic
icons are placed on houses where the people who
added to L o n d o n life over the years lived or
stayed. The plaques are part of
the London landscape: what
