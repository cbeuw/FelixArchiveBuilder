John O'Leary, the Aeronautics departmental photographer, has been awarded
an MBE in recognition of his work as a policeman in the 'Specials', writes
Aunindya Sinharay. John was recommended for the honour by the Area
Head Office of the Special Constabulary and also by his own Peckham
Divisional Station. Describing himselfas "an operational officer walking the
street", he told F E L I X that it is almost unique for an ordinary officer to
receive this type of honour especially since he has served in the force for a
comparatively short time - seventeen years. Citing one of his chief tasks as
'selling the old bill', he has been heavily involved in community projects.
Every summer he helps take up to 800 South London youths camping for a
month in an character building initiative, as part of the Southwark Youth
Project. The annual trip costs around £50,000 of which he helps to raise
£10,000. He is also involved with the Christmas Care Association, working
forfifteenhours every Christmas Day to provide food for over 400 elderly
people. Currently holding the rank of Special Inspector, John's technician
alter-ego works in the Aeronautics Department where he has been since
joining in 1956 as a junior technician. Mr. Ron Adams, Aeronautics
departmental superintendent, told F E L I X ; "He's known to me and to
others for his all round willingness to help whenever he can ... it couldn't have
happened to a nicer person."
Lectures Move

It has now been confirmed that,
starting next term, chemists will
have the majority of their
lectures i n the Sherfield
Building. The move has been
forced by preparations for the
construction of the Basic Medical
Science (BMS) building.
Professor A l a n Swanson,
Pro-Rector for Educational
Quality, said the 'displaced'
departments had 'all been very
helpful'. The Chemistry depart-
ment has been offered exclusive
use of the 120-seat Pippard
Lecture theatre, the larger of the
Sherfield Building's two lecture
theatres. Biochemists will use the
Read Theatre and Huxley 140.
No extra time provision is
being made for students to travel
from labs and lectures to
Sherfield. Professor Swanson
said that the students and staff
would have to become more
disciplined to ensure that
lectures start punctually.
Aware of the wider benefits
that the B M S development will
b r i n g to Imperial College,
Professor David Phillips, Head of
the Chemistry Department,
seemed at ease with the required
moves. H e said that "it's
inevitable that old buildings will
have to be sacrificed." H i s
department will be losing three
lecture theatres and a large
tutorial room.
Prof Phillips told F E L I X
that he hoped chemistry courses
would not experience too much
timetabling disruption. H i s
Department has previously run
the majority of lectures in the
mornings, w i t h laboratory
sessions i n the afternoon.
Stressing the importance of
laboratory work i n chemistry
courses, he said, "Imperial
chemistry graduates are charact-
erised by the amount of practical
work they do ... it's why industry
beats a path to our door."
Asked whether he was happy
with next term's arrangement, he
admitted: "it's the only com-
promise. A l a n Swanson's been
very accommodating." Professor
P h i l l i p s believes that cons-
truction work on the B M S
project will begin on schedule
and that vibration-damping
equipment may be required for
some of the department's experi-
mental equipment.
Liberal Agenda for IC Cash
BY A N D R E W S M I T H
A new draft document setting out
the Liberal Democrat view of the
future of further and higher
education could be disastrous for
Imperial College if ever imple-
mented. Their plans centre on a
more equitable sharing of the
£600 m i l l i o n that the H i g h e r
Education Funding Council of
England ( H E F C E ) gives to
universities to spend on research.
The present system sees IC
receiving relatively large
amounts, since H E F C E targets
'centres of excellence'. T h e
Liberal Democrat document says
that 'centres of excellence' do not
exist: a point strongly denied by
Imperial College authorities.
They suggest that the document
addresses a problem which does
not exist, and question whether
the L i b Dems have actually
consulted any universities other
than ex-polytechnics.
T h e L i b Dems propose
cutting the proportion of the
£600m research money that is
currently given to institutions
like IC. This would help spread
£200 million across the whole
system 'to enable all academic
staff to engage i n research or
development work'.
T h i s idea goes funda-
mentally against IC's argument
that scarce research money must
be concentrated. One senior
college official questioned the
benefit of giving money to people
who are 'not any good at research
and who probably never will be'.
The other main plank of the
draft policy is the modularisation
of all higher education courses.
Thus students could obtain
qualifications - using waystage
marks rather than degrees - after
studying from a wide variety of
subjects. Again, this is funda-
mentally contrary to college
policy, recently outlined by the
Rector. He emphasised that IC
must defend the benefits of full
time residential degree courses.
W h i l s t questioning the
experience that the L i b e r a l
Democrat planners have of
higher education, College autho-
rities expressed the hope that
they might invite them to college
to 'show them what really
happens'. In this way, they say,
politicians could be convinced
that funds must be focused on
high quality research centres.
