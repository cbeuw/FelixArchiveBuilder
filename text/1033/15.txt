Answering back! The final words of the year... Edited this week by Marcus Alexander
E quality... ... Maybe
Freedom?
Dear Felix,
I feel that I have to write in res-
ponse to Farida Begum's letter last
week, about freedom of speech.
This is however a very difficult
issue to tackle. The policy run by
ICU and by most student unions is
not anti-freedom of speech, it's an
anti-racist issue.
I can't comment on the ICU
IslamSoc meetings which have
been cancelled, I only know that
they are not cancelled at whim, but
only with good reason after much
consideration by the Union Office
and security. After the events of
the beginning of the year, so
accurately reported in FELIX in the
autumn term, where King's College
Jewish Society students had to be
police escorted off their campus,
after a meeting of King's College
"Current affairs" Society was
cancelled, I would very much hope
that similar does not occur here.
In my position as Jewish Society
Chair there are many safeguards I
need to adhere to to protect the
members, and there are many
events which we do not hold
because of the fear of racist
groups. Before we have a meeting
we are supposed to check the
room, and all our publicity is not
meant to mention room places or
times, we are meant to just tell the
people we know are coming. The
Muslims at IC are in the "minority"
of 2,000. Although I am not
branding anyone a fundamentalist
or a racist, these people are active,
and IC is on the NUS list of top ten
"fundamentalist hotbeds" in the
country. Whilst I have very very
fortunately not had to incur'the
ordeal of taunts, daubings and
actual attacks incurred by many of
my colleagues, I have had posters
torn down pretty regularly. I would
not like to see this escalate further.
These people who cite "freedom
of speech" generally, in their "free
speech" incite hatred against
women, Hindus, Serbs, homo-
sexuals and Jews, to name just a
few. Whilst I am not saying that
every member of IslamSoc is
associated with Hizb-ut-tahrir, I
would like to remind my friend that
everyone's point of view needs to
be accounted for, and everyone's
feelings taken into account.
Although everyone does deserve
the right of freedom of speech,
even more so everyone deserves
their freedom of movement,
education, and religious or social
belief. That is what ICU policy was
designed to acheive.

Cypriots are
Cypriots!
Dear Editor,
From my having read "Felix"
several times, I have formed the
impression that the students'
weekly magazine does not cover
any kind of British or International
political issues. Therefore, people
writing in it do not need to be
thoroughly informed on such
matters.
Though intended to be a
humorous, holiday article, Frank
Poole's "postcard from Cyprus"
brings politics into one's mind.
Does he really believe that "Cyprus
is...the disputed territory of Greece
and Turkey"? Saying something as
stupid as that, shows lack of
knowledge of history and
geography to an unacceptable
degree. Someone should better
inform Mr. Poole that Cyprus "is
meant to belong" to the Cypriots
themselves. It's typically a free
country and does not belong as a
whole or as a part neither to
Greece, nor to Turkey. It seems like
Mr. Poole is not aware of the 1 974
Turkish invasion to the
undisputedly Cypriot until then,
island of Cyprus. Turkey had been
condemned by the UN and
countless other international
organisations for its actions in
Cyprus. Two thousand Cypriots
were lost, and are still after 20
years considered to be missing,
although they have most probably
died in Turkish prisons. Obviously,
their relatives do "understand what
is going on". I wonder sometimes,
how many of the tourists spending
their holidays in any of the
northern coastal cities of Cyprus
are aware of the fact that the
Cypriots were violently forced to
abandon their properties there, in
July 1974.
Politics as you probably know,
may involve some very sensitive
issues. This careless, ignorant
article on Cyprus is a heavy insult,
not only to our Cypriot fellow
students of the College, but to any
democratic mind. If Mr. Poole
wants to distinguish the country
into two parts, then he must
somehow understand that the
northern one is under Turkish
occupation and the southern is still
free. At least for the sake of Felix's
neutral approach to any kind of
politics, the truth must be restored
to the eyes of your readers. Some
politics in your magazine would not
hurt as much as ignorance and
indifference do.
Sincerely yours,
Spyros Michas
Dear Felix,
It is with great interest that I
read the articles on the social
position of men and women (Felix
1032). Despite the differing
perspectives on who is the true
victim of subjugation and prejudice,
one point seems to form the
common denominator in the
arguments of all correspondents.
That is, whether one likes it or not,
the overwhelming trend in almost
every society at whatever stage of
development is currently towards
further emancipation of women
and their increased participation in
society.
However, few people seem to
have considered other social
transformations that have
traditionally accompanied this
process of liberalisation, namely
changes in sexual practices and
their impact on family and personal
relationships. I am not aware of
any society which has trodden the
road to modernisation and social
reform without a simultaneous
proliferation of promiscuioty and
deterioration of the moral and
ethical norms that constitute the
very foundation of stable families.
Whether this is a pure historical
coincidence or is in fact the product
of a causal relationship is the
crucial question that has not yet
been fully addressed.
Today's western civilisation was
preceded by that of the East. One
of the fundamental differences
between the two is in their
treatment of women; the former
preaches freedom and equality of
women, whereas the latter was
based on a system of values which
subordinated women to men, and
denied them many of the priveliges
that men widely enjoyed. Yet,
perhaps ironically, this civilisation
gave birth to a culture that elevated
the status of women and attributed
to them an almost divine and
heavenly sanctity.
Here indeed lies my dilemma.
Freedom and equality of both men
and women is, in my opinion, a
moral imperative as well as a social
inevitability. Yet I cannot help
noting that the western model of
equality had been effected only at
a very high price, exterminating
some of the finest elements of the
human spirit and destroying the
fabric of stable and compassionate
families. Many of the traditional
societies are only just beginning to
go down this road. Therefore: If
[the western model] of equality of
sexes is to culminate in such tragic
ending, shouldn't we think again
about it?
Yours sincerely,
Yasser Hatami (EE3)
What everyone seems to forget
when ranting on about the
male/female issue is that,
underneath it all, there are very
few differences between us. OK,
there are some obvious physical
differences but as far as I am
concerned the rest are cultural. The
issue of woman in science has
interested me. Girls are doing as
good as, if not better than, boys in
science in general, especially if you
look at last year's GCSE maths
results. Yet the proportion of
women studying the 'hard' sciences
is still very low. Why is this? Well
Fiona Duerden can rest assured
that the fault does not lie with the
admissions tutors, as a woman
applying for these subjects is more
likely to be accepted than a man
(UCCA statistics 1 994). The fact is
that girls aren't as interested in a
career in science as the boys.
Why have we got into the whole
masculine/feminine stereotype
anyway? Traditional roles are
ingrained into society but it wasn't
always this way. Throughout the
ages, women have fought beside
their men and even led them into
battle.
On the issue of positive
descrimination, I certainly wouldn't
want to think that I had only got a
job because my employers needed
to fill their quota of women.
OK, I do have a gripe that finds
in favour of feminism on one thing
covered by last weeks Felix and
that is the portrayal of women by
the media. Personally, it is not
offensive just banal. One day they
will make well scripted big budget
films in which the women don't
continually have hysterics in the
name of dramatic impact: we're
not completely incapable, even if
we are supposed to be the weaker
sex.
What I have been trying to say is
that if a crime has been committed
against women then we were there
casting stones of our own. Are
women really the guilt-free and
helpless victims in all of this? Think
about it and maybe you might
begin to see why I call myself an
equalitarian and not a feminist.

One letter writer asked that his
letter not be cut; unfortunately this
was not possible. However, in
interests of equality all letters were
cut to an equal length. Such is life.
