Aunty McPickle says all your problems are real. Oh dear
Dear Aunty McPickle,
My girlfriend is a recently qualified
gynaecologist; she deals a lot with
old women. Personal hygiene is not
one of her fortes and since becoming
a doctor it hasn’t improved.
She always has dirty finger nails
and they have started to get really
bad, to the point where I just try to
blank it out. To add to this, during
sex she often expresses her pleasure
by digging her nails into my back. I
have developed some pussy pustules
which look infected. What should I
do?
Terry Bourbons
Dear Terry
It looks like you seriously need to ad-
dress this. She needs to clean! Tell her
simply that unless she keeps herself
scrubbed, you are not going to touch
her. Be careful, though, as women can
often go longer without sex from their
partners than men. This is usually
because they can get more action else-
where because they have tits.
So if she holds out longer than you do
– which is likely – don’t find a prosti-
tute, as you’ll have to pay her extra to
ignore the pustules. Make an anony-
mous complaint to her hospital when
you get your back looked at. She may
lose her job, but at least she’ll not be
putting her hands in any more granny
fannies for a while.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
On a recent visit home, I walked in
on my granddad having a wank over
Coronation Street. He was making
strange groans and crying out “Dei-
dre”
. At the time I was horrified and
screamed “you dirty old man” at him
but thankfully he did not notice me. I
now feel I was too harsh in my initial
disgust. How should I confront him?
Jack Offman
Dear Jack,
This does sound traumatic. It might be
best to not bring this up. He clearly has
no idea that you caught him and it re-
ally isn’t doing anyone any harm.
Maybe next time you should be a lit-
tle bit more cautious about entering
rooms and your choice of seat. Consid-
er buying him some sofa covers. People
that age tend to prefer neutral colours,
such as beige or a light grey, but so that
it is easier to clean up, consider buying
those plastic covers old people seem to
love.
Hope this clears up,
Aunty McPickle xxx
Sorry Granddad, but two things: 1) she’s taken, and 2) ew seriously what the fuck?
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have just returned from a trip to
Amsterdam with my old mates from
school. As you can imagine some
pretty un-holy things happened but
one has scarred me mentally. Ba-
sically it took place in a dark hall,
where a massively fat prostitute was
doing loads of tricks which involved
pulling things out of her vagina. This
was all reasonable but then she came
over to me with a banana wedged
between her poon-lips. I was asked
to eat the slippery banana. I had do
it. It smelt worse than shit. I can’t
explain how bad it was but some-
thing was definitely rotten and it
wasn’t the fruit. I managed to do
it and so have received nothing but
praise from my friends but I am now
haunted with visions of decompos-
ing poonanas.
Will Fezito
Dear Will
I think you should see a counsellor
about this. I think maybe some hypno-
tism may be needed to help you blank
this scented scene out. Otherwise, you
may have to wait until scientists dis-
cover mindbleach.
Yours,
Aunty McPickle xxx
Yes, the rumours are true (though, un-
less you’re a hack, you probably haven’t
heard any of these rumours). We, RAG,
are currently in possession of a decep-
tively heavy CGCU mascot which goes
by the name of Bolt (pretty creative,
since it actually is a bolt...). He/she/
it is being held in a secret location,
gagged and blindfolded (but well fed
nevertheless).
Late at night, it cries for its dear older
brother, Spanner. Poor thing. We have
approached the CGCU with a proposal
for its handover – possibly involving
some sort of ransom – and we’ll keep
you informed on how things turn out!
On another note, with Christmas-
time coming up remarkably fast, RAG
has managed to secure some insanely
awesome carol singing permits! Our
very own choir will be using their an-
gelic voices to enchant passersby into
sparing some change for our charities.
The first carol singing session is on
Friday, the 4th of December at Green
Park Station and it will be led by the
Imperial College Chamber Choir. We
are taking along 5-7 collectors to this
Old school carolling collections
wonderful event.
Our main carolling event will take
place on the 14th of December be-
tween 18:00 and 19:00, when RAG will
team up with the Main Choir to have
a carol singing/collection on a massive
stage in, wait for it, Trafalgar Square! It
will be right under the huge Christmas
tree and we will be taking along 15-20
collectors for this.
To make sure that you don’t miss out
on either of these wonderful Yuletide
collection opportunities, e-mail RAG
at rag@ic.ac.uk. Don’t worry. You won’t have to dress like this, unless of course you want to
