Most of us buy clothes without a sec-
ond thought. Fashion these days is
seen as disposable, and the recession
has only increased the number of trips
to cheap clothing stores to find bar-
gains. With the ice caps melting, wild-
life dying out, pollution increasing,
and the rainforests being cut down,
clothing seems low down on the list of
environmental priorities, but choosing
what clothes you buy and where you
buy them takes hardly any effort and
can have a big impact on the lives of
many people and animals. After all, the
clothing companies will produce what-
ever sells well, and if that happens to
be ethically laudable, then that’s what
will start being sold. So where should
you start?
First of all is the human cost. Many
stores keep their prices down by us-
ing sweatshop labour, often under-
paid and using children as part of the
workforce in countries where employ-
ment legislation is lax or unenforced.
Stores which ensure that their clothes
are made by properly paid and legal
workforces will advertise the fact, and
consumer information about clothing
brands that fail to follow ethical stand-
ards is easy to find from a simple web
search.
After ensuring ethical standards for
the clothing makers, then comes the
problem of deciding what standards to
apply to the materials that make up the
clothes. Few of us would buy clothing
made from fur, and it’s unlikely you’ve
read this far into this article if you’re
Make do and mend
wearing your favourite hat of Sumatran
tiger fur, but is there much difference
between leather from farmed cattle
and fur from farmed mink? The leath-
er is sometimes seen as a by-product
of the meat industry, but a demand is
still being created which contributes to
the need for farming. If you are going
to buy clothes made from animal skins,
at least ensure that they come from
sustainable, farmed sources. Wools are
a whole different area, as farmed sheep
need to be shorn of their wool each
year, although vegans object to this
on the grounds that the sheep are still
being farmed and exploited. Some ve-
gans even object to silk, although most
people remain unmoved by the fate of
moth larvae.
Many clothes, especially the cheap-
est ones are made out of man-made
fibres. Polyester clothing, trainers, and
many others, are all made from non-
biodegradable oil products. Man-made
fibres are present in so many clothes
that it’s very difficult to avoid them al-
together, but you can ensure that they
do not make up the bulk of your cloth-
ing. Fabrics made from plant fibres
avoid most ethical problems, and cot-
ton and linen are the two main fabrics
made from plant fibres. But even here,
more pesticides are used on cotton
than on any other single crop. Look for
clothing that is labelled as being made
from organic cotton, which avoids
these problems. A range of cellulose
fabrics made from trees also exist: Ray-
on, Modal and Viscose are made from
wood chips that are cooked and spun
into silk- or cotton-like fabrics, but this
then contributes to deforestation.
The most ethically sound materials,
however, are recycled ones. The easi-
est way to recycle clothing is simply to
donate to charity shops, or put your
unwanted clothes in clothes banks so
that the clothing is kept in circulation,
and not simply thrown away when it
still has wear left in it.
Thursday: Green Fair 11am-3pm, Great Hall
While there are pros and cons to the
meat industry, there’s no denying that
most of us probably eat too much meat.
Whether you decide to go the full-slog
and turn vegan, or make the choice to
only eat organic, locally-sourced meat
we can make a difference to the envi-
ronment with our eating habits.
Meat Free Monday is a national cam-
paign to encourage us to cut meat out
from our diet for one day of the week.
Simply doing this one action will result
in a significant cut in greenhouse gas
emissions and is better for your health
too!
Imperial’s Queen’s Tower Room and
Senior Common Room will be going
vegetarian for one day in Green Week
to highlight that meat-free meals can
be delicious and nutritious. There will
also be free recipe cards for you to try
your own hand at some vegetarian
meals at home.

There is a growing consensus
amongst medical professionals
that Climate Change will be one
of the biggest threats to global
health. We have already seen
a significant increases in glo-
bal disasters resulting in cata-
strophic loss of life.
50 years ago the health pro-
fession mounted a fierce cam-
paign against tobacco smok-
ing, despite strong opposition
from the tobacco industry. Once
again, it’s vested interests in
oil investment that have halted
progress for tough action on cli-
mate change. Although climate
change will affect rich and poor,
it is the nations least responsi-
ble that will suffer the most.
Come along on Monday to lis-
ten to Dr Robin Stott from the
Climate and Health Council give
his views on why health profes-
sionals must act now and take
part in the discussion on how
we can play our part.
Meat free Monday
The End of the Line, the first
major feature documentary film
revealing the impact of over-
fishing on our oceans is being
shown on campus as part of
Green Week.
In the film we see firsthand the
effects of our global love affair
with fish as food. It examines
the imminent extinction of blue-
fin tuna, brought on by increas-
ing western demand for sushi;
the impact on marine life result-
ing in huge overpopulation of
jellyfish; and the profound im-
plications of a future world with
no fish that would bring certain
mass starvation.
Filmed over two years, The
End of the Line follows the in-
vestigative reporter Charles Clo-
ver as he confronts politicians
and celebrity restaurateurs,
who exhibit little regard for the
damage they are doing to the
oceans.
One of his allies is the former
tuna farmer turned whistle-
blower Roberto Mielgo on the
trail of those destroying the
world’s magnificent bluefin tuna
population.
Filmed across the world from
the Straits of Gibraltar to the
coasts of Senegal and Alaska to
the Tokyo fish market featuring
top scientists, indigenous fish-
ermen and fisheries enforce-
ment officials, The End of the
Line is a wake-up call to the
world.
