“Dear Mr Rector. You must be a bit
down after your sacking resignation,
I’ve been there before and I know
how we all need shoulders to cry on.
I hope you will accept my offer of a
quick blowie on the top of the Queen’s
Tower. Then after that we can move
on and have sex in literally every sin-
gle room in college. This is to include
all student rooms too. Hollar me back
if your interested.

“You were the girl who I asked if you
minded showing me your massive
boobs. You said yes at which point you
boob punched me in the face. Forget
the blood and broken nose, I loved it.
Let me see them again!”

“To the girl with massive nipples. You
showed the whole of dBs that you
could actually fit 6 CDs onto them
when erect. That made something else
in my proximity very erect too.

“Am I pleased to see you or has some-
one just put a canoe in my pocket? No
I really am that pleased to see you,
and my knob is that big!”

“I have a crazy number of flavoured
condoms and despite my best ef-
forts, I can’t use them. Halp”
Tell me what’s your flavour
“I saw you at council through a let-
terbox slit. Too scared to say hi, but
if I do will you say hi back to me?
Maybe more?.

Well done to David Blundell
from The Tough Brets who man-
aged to find GOLDHAWK ROAD,

= 2+1+14+11=28. Job done.
So which London tube station sums to 104?
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and every word
has a value equal to sum of the values
of its letters. Scan and send the Un-
derground station that is hidden each
week to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk

Well done to last week’s winner L Parchso or something. It
would be really helpful if you do include a name when you
enter, or we are all left scratching our heads a bit. You see? In
fact a bloke who sold me a spanner called Dave might have
won, but I’m now all that sure.
