felix FRIDAY 20 NOVEMBER 2009
You might be feeling a bit de-
pressed. I am. The world econ-
omy is faltering, the climate looks
set to change beyond recogni-
tion, resource depletion may pre-
vent us from taking the strongest
actions that are needed for a tran-
sition to a low-carbon economy...
and it’s all a bit overwhelming.
What on earth can we possibly
hope to do about it?
So I thought I would share with
you some of the things that I am
doing to make the transition less
painful, firstly to show that it is
possible to do these and still lead
a relatively normal life, andsec-
ondly in the hope that you may be
inspired to take up some of these
personal changes yourself.
1. I don’t fly. I don’t have fam-
ily abroad and therefore I have
no need to fly at all. My research
(climate modelling) does not in-
volve field trips and I can attend
conferences in the UK and Eu-
rope by train. Incidentally, I’m
going cross-country skiing in
Germany at New Year. Not flying
does not mean giving up your
holidays, as some hysterical
complainants would have you
believe. But blowing your entire
yearly global fair share of carbon
emissions on an unnecessary re-
turn flight seems pretty crazy.
2. I am nearly a vegetarian.
Actually, I’ve been pretty close
to it for years as I can never be
bothered to cook meat, and the
Erica Thompson’s top 10 tips for beating green-fatigue!
range of vegetarian options is pret-
ty good. I never buy meat, and I
don’t eat it except at special events.
I also recently switched dairy milk
for soya milk (avoiding rainforest-
destroying brands), and was sur-
prised at how nice it is!
3. I switched my electricity sup-
plier to one which provides “100%
renewable electricity” (greenwash
- they get paid to do this anyway)
AND also tears up the “renewable
obligation certificates” (ROCs) that
it receives for doing so. This does
increase the amount of installe-
drenewable supply in the UK.
4. I went to see my MP (Justine
Greening, Conservative, Putney)
about resource depletion and the
coming UK energy crisis. She has
promised to investigate her party’s
policy on oil depletion for me.
5. I talk about climate change,
energy policy and resource deple-
tion at any opportunity (contact me
on e.thompson07@imperial.ac.uk
if youwant to join the discussion).
6. I have joined my local Transi-
tion Town (Google it).
7. I have joined my local Friends
of the Earth group, who campaign
to the local council to Get Serious
on CO2.
8. I try to buy local, seasonal
fruit and vegetables. That doesn’t
mean going OTT and living on cab-
bage for the whole winter, it just
means checking labels, not buying
fresh produce from outside Europe
and choosing UK stuff whenever
possible. I recently discov-
ered celeriac, a British vegeta-
ble I had never heard of but
tastes amazing!
9. I don’t buy things I don’t
need. I am on my second
mobile phone as the first one
only lasted six years. I mend
my favourite clothes instead
of chucking them out. I’ll take
the tap water over the plastic-
bottled fizzy brown sugar wa-
ter with phosphoric acid any
day
10. I think about the future
could be like. I will be 65 in
2050. It’s important to me that
we get there safely, and I am
voting with my feet what sort
of future I want to have.
Green Week 2009
S
ince setting up Imperial’s first
Green Week in 2006, I have
seen real highs and lows in
Imperial’s long journey on
the road to sustainability. I
can’t help feeling as I write this that I
would have given up a long time ago if
it wasn’t for the fact that I’ve noticed a
stirring, a seismic shift almost, in Im-
perial’s attitude towards its impact on
the environment. I remember sitting in
a Q&A session with the then-Rector,
Richard Sykes, who assured me he
wasn’t the bad guy. After all, he “didn’t
leave the tap running when he brushed
his teeth”. I left the room feeling a mix-
ture of frustration and disappointment,
Hannah Theodorou
Hannah Theodorou knowing that moving the Green agen-
da forward under his reign would be a
tall challenge.
However, since then we’ve done
some remarkable and encouraging
things. This will be Imperial’s 4th
Green Week. 1300 of you signed a pe-
tition encouraging the Union to intro-
duce a comprehensive environmental
policy (which it did in 2007). We’ve
marched, we’ve recycled, we’ve cam-
paigned, we’ve switched off and above
all we’ve had fun. We even painted the
Rector green, in way or another.
I certainly haven’t done it on my
own- there has been an amazing dedi-
cated group of people who have been
instrumental in this change, both from
the student body and College staff.
Soon it’ll be my time to move on from
Imperial, but I can do it happily know-
ing that we’ve got the ball rolling and
you’ll all be taking over the helm. I
hope many of you will find something
to take part in during the week and it’ll
inspire you to put on something even
bigger and better next year!
This year we’ll be focusing on sign-
ing up students to the national 10:10
campaign (more info on www.1010uk.
org) so come and visit us in the Sher-
field Foyer.
After Green Week, on the 5th of
December we’ll be joining the masses
marching in London to call on world
leaders to take action on Climate
Change.
For more information about this and
all the other events visit www.imperi-
alcollegeunion.org/green
This year at Imperial we’re hop-
ing to take the first step towards
a better, happier, healthier fu-
ture. If we decide not to, we
know what a future with climate
change will bring and none
of us want that. Carbon is the
problem and starting to cut our
carbon is the first step of the so-
lution. That’s why we’re asking
everyone to make a simple 10%
cut in their carbon over the next
year. We’re on board, are you?
By signing up to a 10% target
we’re not just supporting 10:10
– we’re making it happen. In
our homes, in our workplaces,
our schools and our hospitals,
our galleries and football clubs
and universities, we’ll be back-
ing each other up as we take
the first steps on the road to
becoming a zero-carbon soci-
ety. It’s easy to feel powerless in
the face of a huge problem like
climate change, but by uniting
everyone behind immediate,
effective and achievable action,
10:10 enables all of us to make
a meaningful difference.
10:10 is the perfect oppor-
tunity to discover what’s pos-
sible when we work together
and we’ll be signing people up
to 10:10 in the Sherfield Foy-
er (walkway level) every day
throughout Green Week. Come
along and sign up!
Sign up to 10:10 this Green Week
and do your bit to save the planet
Take a break on Wednesday afternoon
to have a tour of the Environmental
Society’s Wildlife Garden located in
Prince’s Gate Gardens. We’ll be pro-
viding you with all the tools and items
required to pot up your own herbs to
take home, or you can even have a go
at a spot of digging!
Make your own way there by going
to Weeks Hall in Prince’s Gardens and
going through the gate to the right of it
(you’ll need your swipe card for access).
Follow the path to the next gate which
leads into Prince’s Gate Gardens. The
Environmental Society’s Wildlife Gar-
den is the fenced-off garden at the back
and there will be people there to greet
you.
The Kingsnorth Six made history
last year: accused of causing £30,000
of criminal damage to Kingsnorth
power station, their defence of “law-
ful excuse”was accepted by the jury -
because they were acting to safeguard
property around the world “in imme-
diate need of protection” from the im-
pacts of climate change, caused in part
by burning coal.
Inspired by their story internation-
ally acclaimed director, Nick Broom-
field has just completed a 20 minute
film celebrating the spirit of direct ac-
tion. The film tells the story activists
who scaled the 220m chimney at a coal
fired power station and the landmark
case with supporting testimony by the
world’s leading climate scientist, Dr
James Hansen of NASA. Come along
this lunchtime to hear their story with
a pint in hand!
