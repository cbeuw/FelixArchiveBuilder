The kids are alright (and valuable)
Feeling old? Allow us to help – Mike Cook doesn’t think you matter any more, and he’s got two reasons why
T
he Entertainment Soft-
ware Association, a trade
association for the US
games industry, has some
statistics on its website.
Amongst these, one in particular
stands out as strange: “The average
game player is 35 years old and has
been playing games for 12 years.” This
echoes the findings of various and
amusing surveys held over the past few
years, the most recent carrying the de-
lectable subheader that gamers are fat
and depressed. However, anyone who
tells you that the old folk matter in the
industry is plain wrong, because the
fact of the matter is that the youngsters
shape this industry – and you’re not
one of them any more.
You might think that, as you sail to-
wards your mid-twenties like a greased
cinder block on a waterslide, you’re
entering the key target demographic
for gamers. You’re at that point where
anyone will listen to your ideas, no
matter how stupid they are. ESA find-
ings are richer than just suggesting an
average age of 35 – they go on to state
that 34% of gamers are females above
the age of eighteen; that there are more
gamers aged over fifty than under
twenty. But numbers like this
are meaningless to
big business for one
simple reason – for
the ESA to count
you as
a gamer, you need to buy a couple of
games. For companies to count you
as a target, you need to buy the most
games.
We talked to Andrew, a thirteen
year-old gamer, about the sorts of
games he likes to play now, and how
many he buys in a year.
The first game Andrew remem-
bers playing is Croc on the Playsta-
tion. Croc was a 3D platformer aimed
squarely at kids, so it’s no surprise
Andrew cut his teeth on that. But that
soon led to more frenetic games that
Andrew could play himself
– Ratchet &
Clank on the PlayStation2 and Unreal
Tournament on the PC. Andrew cer-
tainly would’ve beaten me at almost
any game when I was his age.
Why are they more important? Be-
cause they grew up with the Playstation
and the N64 – they grew up after the
point where gaming became a genuine
Nowadays, Andrew enjoys first-
person shooters. He’s playing Modern
Warfare 2 at the moment, and hopes to
pre-order Halo Reach and Max Payne
3 in the near future. When I ask him
about the violence in the games, he ad-
mits that some games do have a lot of
killing in them. But he’s “sensible”, he
says. It’s easy to believe him – he says
he buys games based on their reviews,
not the number of guns in them. Still,
he seems to enjoy them nonetheless.
As time goes on, we’re seeing
more and more dis-
tinction between
the gaming
equivalent of
pop music
and the rest
of the mar-
ket. There’s
a main-
stream core
to gaming
that’s by no
means casual,
but has a particular feel to it – it’s the
sensation that runs through Far Cry 2,
through Gears of War, through Smash
Bros. and through the modern Tomb
Raiders – and this isn’t a point about
violence being made here. It’s a point
about simplicity, what’s marketable,
and how much effort is required to sell
another unit to someone who made a
purchase one, three, six months ago.
It’s almost evolutionary – a games
studio will offer a twist on a currently
popular game, and the kids either buy
it or don’t. You don’t get that sense of
progression in the older demograph-
ics. You don’t get much at all, really, ex-
cept Puzzle World Crossword Touch.
Whilst we have the most disposable
income, we don’t make or break games
any more at our age. We’re predictable,
repetitive, and we don’t buck the trend,
and this is why we no longer shape the
industry. So peruse the two articles our
youngsters wrote, and remind your-
self that they’re the trend-set-
ters now. Looks like mods
and Mario Kart are in
this year, then.
“they’re the
trendsetters now”
Review: Mario Kart
It has a wide range of tracks and vehi-
cles but you do not get them straight
away. You have to win or get second or
third place to open new tracks. Some-
times, you get a few glitches in the
game but the game corrects itself. The
gaming characters are Mario, Luigi,
Yoshi, Birdo, Baby Luigi, Funky Kong,
Dry Bowser, Rosalina, Daisy, Bowser
Jr, Dry Bones, Baby Daisy, King Boo,
Diddy Kong, Toadette.
You can also play multi-player. I think
it is more fun to play with your friends
because you have more of a challenge.
You can also go online where you can
race people around the world if you
have wireless internet. And on the
game you have different objects you
can get to help you out, like a banana
or triple banana that make other cars
spin out of control. You also have one
green shell or three of them that you
can use to knock over vehicles only
in a straight line. One red shell or you
can have three that lock-on to vehicles
in front of you. A Bom-omb explodes
knocking over any vehicle in the area.
A spiny shell can hit the leading vehi-
cle. There are other items you can use
in the game such as a fake item, dash
mushroom or three of them, golden
dash mushroom, bullet bill, blooper,
lightning, super star, mega mushroom,
POW block, thundercloud. These
make the game more fun to play. You
can use a choice of vehicles in the
game. They are a motorbike and a car/
go-kart. The controls are easy to use
when playing.
I would rate this game.
Feature: Modding

Are mods worth it? The way to put this
is, yes, they are an amazing waste of
your life.
Mods have become very popular in
the world of gaming, people making
modifications of their own with special
programs. When you play your first
mod or get your first flippin’ skin to
work in Counter Strike, then you like
mods and want to make one yourself.
Mods give us something that an or-
dinary game won’t give us. Take Unreal
Tournament 3 – this is a game where
you can’t get many characters in so
there are new ones with new sounds,
skins and more.
A good mod is one that can change
a game completely like The Haunted
which changes Unreal completely. You
can play on your own or with friends.
It is a mod set in a church, the west
and many more places so you can kill
zombies! I wouldn’t be surprised if it
said when you got GODLIKE. Instead
it said ZOMGWTFBBQ.
When modding a game you need to
backup the files so if the mod does not
work you can get the old stuff back and
work on the other mod while playing
the game as well.
If you are like me and you like mod-
ding UT3, you should definitely mod
the mutators to get more of an effect
on the game. I’ve been using the Giba-
licious mutator which increases the
gore and blood. Also there is the Gears
of Unreal mutator which gives you the
Gears of War style mode. The jetpack
mutator is a jetpack and if you hold
down jump you fly around the whole
map (I recommend doing that on the
map Deimos because it is a very big
map).
So that is my thought on mods and
basically they are good if you have
nothing to do and you are bored of the
game you’ve got.

We asked Jamie
and Andrew,
two 13 year-old
gamers, to write
us something
about what they
love doing with
their gaming
time.
Let us know
what you think
of our two new
writers, and
we’ll pass your

industry. The over fifties are unlikely
to buy much more than the DS games
and occasional puzzle stuff that’s tai-
lored specifically for them. It’s a lot of
work; it’s not a dependable source of
income. Younger gamers, though, are a
new breed. They’ve been brought up
watching games and seeing them as
a big part of their life. Through this
they’ve learnt what to expect,
and that makes them easier
to sell to.
