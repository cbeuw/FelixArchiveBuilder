T
his is for the beaten down,
spontaneous souls that in-
spired some of the best of
music… Beatniks. The Beat
Generation was a group of American
writers in the 1950s. They rejected
American values, society’s values and
lived the spontaneous life of doing
whatever they wanted, whenever they
wanted and liberating themselves. A
life of non-conformity in order for
pure expression to be achieved.
It’s pretty obvious the 1950s were
a serious turning point on the road
that music was to take. At that time,
jazz and swing was breaking out of
the previously ‘normal’ music style
and the Beat Generation had a lot to
do with that. Whether they knew the
significance of their actions or not, this
generation had set music down a road
which would encounter The Beatles,
Bob Dylan and The Doors. It can be
said that Beatniks were a cause of the
hippie revolution (in my thinking,
we’re on the brink of another hippie
movement. Anyone?). They were true
bohemians.
Jack Kerouac’s writings in ‘On The
Road’ and Allen Ginsberg’s ‘Howl’ are
two books that inspired The Beat Gen-
eration to spread. Jack Kerouac being
the one who introduced the term Beat
Generation.
In the end music is a form of poetry,
with or without lyrics, and the Beat-
niks’ poetry was genius. It went against
conformity in a simple way, it was dif-
ferent. Allen Ginsberg: “The only thing
that can save the world is the reclaim-
ing of the awareness of the world.
That’s what poetry does.” He really
believed in what he was saying. Once
The Beat Generation had grown roots,
they began to put their poems to mu-
sic :soft, quiet, jazzy background ac-
companiments to poems. Sometimes
Beatnik music was stripped down to a
simple poem and beat.
Whatever they did, they did well.
Having a big influence on rock and roll
of the 1960s until today- Bob Dylan be-
ing one of the better-known Beatniks,
but others were members of the acid-
loving Merry Pranksters in the 1960s,
which brought us The Grateful Dead.
Some inspired The Clash, The Doors,
The Rolling Stones and Lou Reed. The
Beat seed had been planted and look at
the road it’s taken us on, not bad at all.
Reviews
This album is full of catchy melodies
and pleasant guitar sounds. But there’s
a huge contrast in styles throughout the
album, as if there was more than one
band in here. The lyrics are try-hard
emo, and the sound never breaks out
of being conventional. Not much that
hasn’t been heard before. That said, it
does sound nice... - Luke Turner
This sentimental ballad would be very
fitting in the middle of a dramatic
scene of Grey’s Anatomy, or another
such TV series- it wouldn’t sound bad
if a tactfully chosen snippet was to
play on-screen, but upon one full lis-
ten, the song surfaces full of dreamy,
soppy, “indie-folk” crooning. It was
made to be background music: the
dynamics are flat, and even with high
strings trailing in and out on top of the
simplistic piano motif, there is no real
assertive melody. Tom Hull’s voice is
too weak to enhance this piece of mu-
sic, being quite nasal, and the instru-
mental ending is bland and stylistically
unimpressive, wrapping up a song that
has been written following the ballad
formula, but lacking in true emotion.

This second album from Alberta Cross
is overpowering. It is amazing, with
brooding blues and the pure power of
emotion. The vocals being exceptional
in some parts and the music impas-
sioned. This is beautiful rock, full of
soul, from a band that will undoubt-
edly inspire many. - Luke Turner

Luke Turner Music Editor
This track commands attention from
the outset by the use of discorded gui-
tar arrangements, which remain effec-
tive until the vocals begin in the lazy,
slurring style so often adopted amongst
vocalists today. The layering of multi-
ple guitars on top of a simple yet thun-
derous drum creates an atmosphere of
tension and urgency which is relieved
at the chorus. However, this musical
structure is used and reused soon be-
coming very predictable; perhaps as
pop music should be. -Joanna Cai

SUMMER
SINGLE
For some this will sound like the equiv-
alent of musical diarrhoea. But for fans
of lo-fi noise-rock in the vein of Times
New Viking and Wavves, this is a glori-
ous piece of work. The third LP from
this London-based band isn’t easy on
the ear, featuring heavily saturated
guitars and incomprehensible scream-
ing. But there are inspired moments
throughout: flirting with doom-metal
and stoner-rock. On a whole, it’s an
abrasive, messy success. -Greg Power

A Welsh “goth”-rock trio consisting

3-+track EP sounds like bland 90s alt-

ly down to Hannah’s dreamy vocals
and a catchy chorus riff. - Greg Power

They’re listed on their myspace as be-
ing rock/punk/alternative: isn’t every
band? (apart from the ridiculously pre-
cise genres like “industrial four dimen-
sional nerdcore!!!!”) This band whole-
heartedly lives up to its description if
you think ‘rock’ means ‘Fallout Boy’;
‘punk’ means ‘Green Day’ and ‘alterna-
tive’ means ‘Panic At The Motherfuck-
ing Disco’. - Tom Jennings

Billed as the first ‘seasonal album’,
Midnight Graces contains reworked

When this band was doing the Brit-
ish thing of waiting in a queue to get
their name they were right at the back,
down the street, round the corner,
over the traffic lights, along the M4, on
the Welsh border. Essentially they’re
not good enough to have a top quality
name like I Hope You Like Your Soggy
Sandwiches. They’re reminiscent of
Lost Prophets; Visions being their
most catchy song. -Tom Jennings

W
e’ve been on the hunt
lately to find out what
Imperial students really
listen to every day, and
we’ve found out! Apparently it’s Biffy
Clyro, which is ok I guess - at least they
kept Muse from taking the top spot.
The chart comes from the felix group
on last.fm (which can be found by us-
ing the above address, felixmusicchart.
tk). If you join the group, it tracks what
you listen to and then makes a chart
based on how many different people
listened to a certain artist. So what are
you waiting for? Go and get a last.fm
account, download their iTunes scrob-
bler and join the group. We both know
that The xx should be number one so
make your listens count!
