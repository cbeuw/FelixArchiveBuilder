enrietta Ludgate has come
a long way since Feburary.
Since her appearance at
the Glasgow Fashion Week
for her debut Autumn Winter 09 col-
lection, she has opened a showroom
in Covent Garden, won this season’s
‘Fashion Innovation’ award and been
praised by Roland Mouret, Dolly
Jones of Vogue.com and Anna Orsini
– the founder of Estethica. She exhib-
ited her latest Spring Summer 2010
collection at the Somerset House dur-
ing London Fashion Week and will
continue to do so this Feburary for her
AW10 designs.
The Scottish designer is a graduate
from Central Saint Martins. She worked
for Osman Yousefzada before setting up
her own label.

Designer Profiles
The softly spoken designer creates
from her studio in the Highlands of Scot-
land. The Scot uses Scottish fabric and
aims to be as sustainable as possible. She
is inspired by the legendary Italian de-
signer Elsa Schiaparelli. Henrietta views
fashion as a type of architecture and
believes that clothing should be closely
connected to the frame of the body.
Her classic sexy numbers feature fu-
turistic rims on the sleeves reinforced
by flexible tubings. Her dresses are a
pleasure to touch. The fabric feels like
a hybrid of spandex and silk. The dress
sits nicely on the body, maximising the
womanly curves. The nice sheen of the
dress gives off a power-woman touch – a
nice balance of femininity and feminism.
Bespoke couture appointments are
available with Henrietta at her London
show room on Exeter Street.

The woven logo on Stamo’s clothes tag
ated pink bow extending all the way
from the waist down to the ankles. The
coat we feature in our photoshoot is
just another example of this theatri-
cal sentiment. The lining of the coat is
ruffled with silk. Wear this inside and
you’ll get a normal looking winter coat
with ruffle trimmings at the opening.
Wear this outside and it looks like an
oversized, romanticised poncho.
Stamo’s ethos is that she tries to pro-
duce the garments in the same region
as they will be sold so that she gives
back to the community as much as she
takes. She also works with crafts that
are dying, for example hand pleating.
She is interested in preserving them as
part of our international heritage and
culture.
Perhaps it’s a Greek thing. She is def-
initely not as fearful as I imagined her
to be. If anything, she is the complete
opposite. She always ends her emails
warmly with “Wishing you a lovely
day.”

London Fashion Week this Feburary.

T
he first time I spoke to Sta-
mo was at the Estethica press
conference. She struck me
as a straight forward busi-
nesswoman – clutching a Blackberry,
dressed in a black suit and a speaking
without emotion. It only occured to
me 5 minutes into the conversation
that this woman – who could probably
bite off anyone’s head in a boardroom
– has handpleated the lapels of her
jackets and many of her Spring Sum-
mer 2010 pieces. And when asked if
she makes all her clothes, the answer
was simply, “Yes.”
The softer side of her is apparent in
all of her designs. Her AW09 pieces
featured many sexy black mini dresses.
Cut outs at strategic places make the
dress slightly edgier than the classics of
Givenchy.
Some of her pieces are theatrically
elaborate. At the front it may look like
a one shoulder body-con; turn the
dress around and there’s an exagger-
