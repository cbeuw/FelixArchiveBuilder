The Green
Machine
I
t’s a bit of a mishmash this week,
as you can probably see. We’ve
got an extra page, onto which
we’ve sprayed a little some-
thing-something about the next
generation of gamers (and why you’re
not invited). We’ve also got a review of
Dragon Age, an RPG that’s taking up
far too much student time this month.
It’s also Green Week, and seeing as
we’re so packed out with other stuff,
now would probably be a great time to
talk about how gaming impacts the en-
vironment. In short – it doesn’t, much.
But what it might do is change the
way you impact the environment. I’m
not talking about things like EcoKids
(http://www.ecokids.ca) with abysmal,
nineties-style games that funnel facts
down your throat at a rate of knots.
These sorts of games have little effect
on the player unless they’re concen-
trating in a learning environment.
We want something more subtle than
that, something that’s still fun. The dif-
ference between games as a social tool
and, say, film is obvious – interactiv-
ity. Consequence, choice, things like that.
ElectroCity goes some way towards that,
by presenting a more enjoyable environ-
ment. You can plonk down to beaches,
prospect for gas and oil, implement en-
ergy efficiency bills and the like. It doesn’t
preach to you, there’s more of a feeling
of “you decide”
. There’s a little rating that
tells you how many rabbits died this year
as a direct result of your actions but it’s
not overtly educational.
But even this is just a little Flash game.
You’re still sitting down to tackle an en-
vironmental problem. There’s a “serious
games” movement dedicated to produc-
ing games that tackle difficult issues, and
even Microsoft has managed to haul their
arse into gear by creating the “Games For
Change” competition that encourages the
development of games about a range of
topics, including the environment.
But it’s all for the purpose of getting the
message across, and that tends to get in
the way of really representing the intrica-
cies of something like this. So this week,
I’ve been playing Democracy 2. And I
think that it’s the best environmental is-
sues game you could ever play. It’s a simu-
lation of political office: you’ve just been
elected President and you’ve got to keep
enough people on-side to get re-elected
next time. Among the many issues you
have to tackle is the environment. But
you’llbesosnowedunderwithothercon-
cerns;thepressureofvotersandlobbyists,
the penalties inherent in actually solving
the problems at hand. The chances are
you’ll probably barely have time to con-
sider the issue, and even if you do, you’ll
face such stiff opposition that it’ll cripple
you for the rest of your term.
It might be depressing, but people need
to understand why things don’t get done
as much as they need to understand why
things should be done. Serious games
need to get serious, and drop the biased
undertone.

Ten Long Years – 2005
B
limey, what a year. Where
to start. Let’s jump right
into the middle of the year
– this was the E3 where
both the Playstation3 and
the XBox 360 got their first airings.
With both the PS2 and the original
XBox still going strong, it was a year of
looking ahead as well as looking to the
shops – the God of War saga began
this year, as well as old faithfuls such
as Tekken and Gran Turismo making
new appearances.
On the PC though, it was the sum-
mer that made the year so great. Bat-
tlefield 2 made modern day, 64-player
online matches possible in a way that
no game had done or has done since.
“Battlefield 2 was, is, the best mul-
tiplayer experience I have ever had
to date. The impact of the real-world
setting and the just-so balance
of the gameplay and vehicles
meant that it was almost
always fun. I really hope
something will come along
one day worthy of suceed-
ing it.”
And then
– uninten-
tionally
Themodernageofgamingbegins–PS3,XBox360andhot,hotcoffee
topical – a developer called
Infinity Ward released a
sequel to a game they
made back in 2003,
with Call of Duty 2. CoD2
really pushed the series forwards,
and began many of the gameplay
tropes that are still in use in the
latest editions.
Speaking of franchise-defining re-
leases, Lego Star Wars popped out
this year. Lu enthuses:
“It shouldn’t work, it certainly
shouldn’t work for adults, but it does.
The only recent platformer to over-
shadow it is Psychonauts which came
out the same year.”
Obviously I was about to mention
Psychonauts. A game that no-one
bought but everyone seems to love.
Odd, that, eh? Go and buy a copy now.
Go on, you miserable bastard. It tried
to keep the platforming lighthearted
and while it utterly fails in some areas,
it at least looks better than Brutal Leg-
end. Sorry, Tim.
Swat IV! Skippy, talk to me.
“One of my top 5 “FFFFUUUUU-
UUU-” games. The phrase “You’re in
my way, sir” still makes the red mist
descend.
“I think the worst mission for me
was that one where there’s a couple of
bombs to defuse within a time limit,
meanwhile thirty Heinz baked bastards
are huddling behind every blind corner
and bathroom.”
The DS also gave Skippy some en-
tertainment this year, it seems, with
Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, which
a few of you mentioned as being a fond
memory.
“Probably
one of my favour-
ite platform games
ever, absolutely bril-
liant and the pin-
nacle of the Castl-
evania series
to my mind.
In fact
I’ve been playing
it through again re-
cently on ‘Julius Mode’ which
makes it a more clas- sical
Castlevania game, and it’s still
brilliant.”
As a counterpoint to the announce-
ment of the next generation, Novem-
ber saw the Playstation2 become the
fastest console to sell a hundred mil-
lion units, overtaking its predecessor
as the holder of the title. It’s a monu-
mental achievement although not
enough to protect Sony from competi-
tion in the current generation.
Finally, who could forget, the hilarious
time we had watching Rockstar wriggle
out of the Hot Coffee fiasco, a furore
so intense and hilarious that it brought
together Hilary Clinton, GTA: San An-
dreas, and thousands of sweaty and anx-
ious teenagers like no event has ever done
since. It sounds like the setup for the per-
fect teen comedy. In many ways, it was.
Next year – the next generation begins
in earnest.

iPlayer Channel
The Wii will get its own BBC iPlayer chan-
