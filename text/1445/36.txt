Drunken-mate photo of the week
xkcd.com
This charming fellow got on a coach, fell asleep, and then threw up. At least,
we think that’s the right order...Red wine or Snakebite, you reckon?
Got a picture of
your mate being
an absolute waste
of oxygen? Well,
get your camera
out and email your
drunken-mate
photos to catnip.

What’s the rankest

eaten?
durian
Pineapple man
Your Mum. (Honestly, she was so goddamn stringy – even

I saw someone in my halls eating cereal out of an unwashed
bowl that had contained pasta the night before. It put me
right off my breakfast.
