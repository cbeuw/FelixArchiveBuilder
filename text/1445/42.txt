chotomy in our performance against
St. Gabriel’s. The first half saw them
free to attack at will while in the sec-
ond period, they were put under much
more pressure and found it harder to
burst forward. In the end they were too
strong.
After this, Gabriel’s and Mitchel’s
played the leader-deciding match of
the group, with Gabriel’s coming out
on top.
It was decided that the winners of
a play-off between Imperial and John
Mitchel’s would play, along with St.
Gabriel’s, in a semi-final against one
of the losing teams from the Cup
competition.
So they took to the field again, and
made sure we gave the Intermediate
champions a serious challenge.
From the throw-in, Imperial bat-
tled well, doggedly defending against
Mitchel’s attacks. Against the run of
play however, they managed to forge
a goal out of a number of attempts by
Imperial to clear the ball. This was fol-
lowed by Keith Laverty, now playing at
centre-forward, converting two scores.
The score stayed the same until half-
time: Imperial 0-2, John Mitchel’s 1-0.
Unfortunately playing with the wind
in the first half again meant we would
always be vulnerable in the second
half, and Mitchel’s managed to break
free to convert a few points.
Some great saves and long clearances
from the Imperial defence, with rookie
Jamie Sanders showing some great
courage, slowed the opposition attack
down, and allowed our forwards to
convert some more scores.
As the final whistle blew, John Mitch-
el’s came out tops, but not without a
very respectable display from Imperial.
So that was it for our championships
this year. All that was left to do was to
get very, very pissed on the bus back to
the union and support the Irish foot-
ball team against France in Da Vinci’s.
This is not the end of the season for
Imperial’s Hurling squad.
The focus now for IC GAA turns
to Gaelic Football where this Sunday
(20th) the men’s team are participating
in a blitz with Oxford and St. Mary’s
universities. Training continues as al-
ways on Wednesdays in Hyde Park.
Gaelic Sports in
high spirits
