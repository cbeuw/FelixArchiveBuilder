Two sides of the environment debate
D
o you believe in sustainable develop-
ment? I mean, really? Let’s stop being
hypocritical and realise that our way
of life is unsustainable. The planet
does not care if we think green: what matters is
acting.
A bit of history - it all starts with Mr Watt and
his steam engine. He led the way to the indus-
trial revolution, which increased the production
capabilities of countries in an extraordinary way.
Never before had human beings produced more
goods in the same period of time. And never be-
fore did we consume so many natural resources.
Thanks to the steam engine and other fantas-
tic inventions, the US and Western Europe got
very rich. The world became more polluted, its
resources were rapidly eaten up and the air got
hotter. No one really cared. What mattered was
getting richer.
Economists thought, and many of them still
think, that more consumption invariably means
more happiness. Governments, who listen to
economists more than anybody else, therefore
tried to increase consumption levels by promot-
ing growth. This makes sense up to a certain level
of wealth. But in rich countries, is this quest for
being ever more wealthy still making us happier?
There is another flaw in most economic mod-
els: they are based on the assumption of infinite
growth. However, in a finite world where produc-
tion is dependent on non-renewable resources,
continuous growth pushes us against the wall.
The current model is not sustainable.
It’s time to reverse the trend, to think of quali-
tative and not quantitative growth. But how?
Over-consumption is destroying our environ-
ment so we should consume less. This might not
even make us less happy. Was my life so much
worse before I got my new iPod? Was I miserable
when my TV was not LCD?
Let us not be fooled: efficiency gains and
cleaner products will not achieve much if total
production always increases. For instance, the
planet does not care if the cars we produce are
more environmentally friendly, or if the number
of cars increases faster than efficiency gains. Un-
fortunately, this is the case right now.
Our need for more is destroying the world. We
are putting too much value on things that do not
necessarily make us happier. There is a case to
be made that the world will be better off and we
won’t be less happy if we consume less stuff. At
the same time there should be no limit to activi-
ties which do not negatively impact the environ-
ment, such as web technologies, the arts, culture
and knowledge of the economy.
If we attach more value to non-material activi-
ties, this will lead governments and the private
sector to redirect investments. Investing mas-
sively in arts and culture can only make a more
diverse, broad minded and richer civilisation.
Spending more money on education will make
the planet smarter and allow us to solve more of
our problems. This is what sustainability is really
about: leaving the planet in a better shape than
that we found it in.
We have to dematerialise growth. It starts in
our everyday life, by slowing down in our quest
for more and by giving value to non-material
things. We could save the world and be happier if
we realise, with Gandhi, that “there is more to life
than increasing its speed.”

Don’t be fooled by “green” growth
T
he term “climate change” is nonsensi-
cal. No one disagrees with the fact
that the climate changes. What many
doubt is the proposition that human-
produced carbon dioxide is having a significantly
warming effect on the planet. We call it “anthro-
pogenic global warming” (AGW).
We all know that carbon dioxide is a green-
house gas; this has been proven by repeatable
experiments. Through this effect, the amount
of radiation reflected increases as the amount of
carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, thus
keeping the planet at a higher temperature.
CO2 on its own is insignificant in determin-
ing the temperature of our planet. Consider that
carbon dioxide only comprises a small fraction
of the greenhouse effect, with almost the entire
rest of the effect taken up by water vapour, which
acts in many ways we do not fully understand yet.
Consider that the greenhouse effect itself is a rel-
atively passive factor in determining the climate
of the planet, surpassed by the oceans, ocean cur-
rents, the Moon, the Sun, orbital variations, and
other flux from extra-terrestrial sources.
So how does the AGW theory manage to make
such big claims about the importance of carbon
dioxide? Well, what they’ve essentially done is
speculate about the dynamics of all sorts of com-
plex and non-linear mechanisms in the climate
that work to amplify the small direct warming
effect from carbon dioxide into a much larger
indirect effect, and then put it into a computer
model. They then run the computer model, show
the Earth blowing up, and present it as proof of
AGW.
There are two bold and glaring problems with
this. First of all, computer models are not proof
of a theory, they are representations of the un-
derstanding of the person(s) who built the model.
To use computer models as proof is a circular ar-
gument. Frankly, it is quite shocking this very
basic point is not challenged more often.
The second problem is that there is no empiri-
cal evidence to support their speculated magni-
fication of the importance of carbon dioxide.
There has never been a period in the Earth’s his-
tory that shows carbon dioxide levels being im-
portant in determining the average temperature
of the planet. When we find correlations in the
data, carbon dioxide levels are trailing tempera-
ture changes, suggesting that temperature influ-
ences carbon dioxide, not the other way around.
There’s no reason to get bogged down in the
processes of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), catalogue the locations
of meteorological equipment (they’ve put these
things next to air conditioners and parking lots,
no joke), or laugh at hockey stick graph data algo-
rithms by putting in random phone numbers and
getting the same shape. Proponents of AGW are
trying to use computer models to prove their the-
ory. That’s not how the scientific method works,
and that’s why I believe we should look at alterna-
tive theories to anthropogenic global warming.
On the scientific consensus, I have two points
to make. Firstly, truth in science is determined
through the scientific method, not the democrat-
ic method. Secondly, whilst there is near unani-
mous support for the AGW theory amongst state
sanctioned scientific organisations- many anony-
mous (to remove the element of peer pressure),
surveys show even divides amongst individual
scientists on the theory. The main purpose of
the claim of consensus is to shut down further
discussion, which is the classic signature of inse-
curity in an argument.
So is AGW a conspiracy theory? The answer,
with some clarification, is yes. A conspiracy is
simply two or more people collectively organis-
ing an illigal or immoral act. All successful con-
spiracies in history have been the same. The
average participant is an unwittingly genuine
believer, and only a few key individuals are be-
ing consciously deceptive. Once the snowballs
get rolling, it rapidly incorporates people who
believe in its moral virtue as well as those who
are keen to profit from this new direction of hu-
man priorities.
Carbon trading is the most likely “solution”
that we will see, and it is a scam. It amounts to a
global wealth redistribution scheme, with skim-
ming operations by various entities all the way
up and down the system. It works like this; you
start with a blank piece of paper. Then, some
bureaucrat sprinkles “carbon credits”. He gives
less to people he wants to steal wealth from, and
more to people who are going to receive a frac-
tion of what’s stolen. If you want to engage in
activities that produce carbon dioxide (which di-
rectly or indirectly means everything under the
Sun) and do not get enough carbon credits from
the bureaucrat, you have to go buy some from the
people he gave lots to. Meanwhile, the real ben-
efactors of this system get into action. First come
unscrupulous carbon traders, who are actively
lobbying for carbon trading. Then, the national
governments take their slice through taxation in
various forms on this trading activity. Finally, the
World Bank takes its cut at 8% of all international
trades, effectively creating the taxation founda-
tion (receiving donations from national Govern-
ments is a weak basis of power) for increased
global governance. If you think that will make
policy implementation more efficient, just recall
what happens when local Government functions
are transferred to a national body. Then scale up.
In conclusion, I do not believe we can say with
certainty whether or not carbon dioxide pro-
duced by humans is producing significant climate
changes. We can, however, still take precau-
tions. It is an observable fact that the wealthier
the economy, the more capable it is of adapting
to environmental changes. We should therefore
aim for economic growth as a flexible and com-
prehensive preparation for any climate problems
we might encounter. Sacrificing growth, by fo-
cusing on mitigating carbon dioxide emissions at
the expense of cheap resources, only to discover
we were wrong, would be catastrophic. We need
our preparation for climate change to cover all
possibilities.
