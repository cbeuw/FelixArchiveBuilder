T
he lofty, skinny frame of
Bradford Cox takes a seat in
front of a plethora of effects
pedals inside this intimate
east London venue. He’s just arrived
this morning, got no sleep on the plane
and he shares with us that we should
not be alarmed if he has to urgently
leave the stage. Turns out he gets the
shits when his sleeping patterns get
fucked up. So it goes.
Delicately noodling some guitar
riffs into his delay pedal, the ambient,
swaying ‘Quick Canal’ quickly begins
to take shape, and he is joined on stage
by vocalist Laetitia Sadier, one of the
guest collaborators on his new album
‘Logos’. When satisfied with his loop
construction Bradford makes for the
drums, prompting a child to take to the
stage and gyrate an ‘interpretive dance’.
This sounds pretentious but I think it
was the son of a friend, and it certainly
was only intended to lighten the mood.
The cosy atmosphere inside Cargo
coupled with Bradford’s friendly nature
make tonight’s show feel like he was
just performing for friends in his front
room, although he points out that only
half of us would be able to fit inside
his whole house. His dialogue with the
crowd, while at times treading in self-
indulgent territory, demonstrates that
he is here just to play songs. He enjoys
not having to simply shift albums and
this makes the evening feel much more

personal. Lacking Noah Lennox (of
Panda Bear and Animal Collective) on
‘Walkabout’, the performance failed to
live up to the recorded standard, but
the catchy ‘Shelia’ sounded really good
and would be my pick for song of the
night.
This was a very impressive display of
how complete a sound could be made
simply by one individual and the aid of
a looping device

A
t the turn of the Century,
a peculiar hybrid of elec-
tronic music and hip-hop
appeared in techno clubs
which was later termed “glitch-hop”.
The movement was created by art-
ists who rejected the forward thinking
of IDM (“Intelligent Dance Music”),
pioneers of the great Warp record la-
bel. Glitch-hop disappeared, and IDM
thrived through ever-changing acts
like Aphex Twin.
Parallel to all this commotion over
what the future of electronic mu-
sic should be named, the Berlin Wall
fell and all over Germany people got
krunkk to the sound of their new-found
freedom.
Amidst a bustling electro scene, Ger-
not Bronsert met Sebastian Szary at an
Albums that you should know
acid rave party in Berlin, and they set
out to make liberating music of their
own.
Throughout the next 15 years they
pulled out sick tunes under various
monikers, finally settling for the name
Modeselektor. In interviews, they de-
scribe their music as “Happy metal,
hard rap, country-ambient, Russian
crunk”, and some douche from a Lon-
don zine called them “bassbin-blowing
techno hop dubstep core”, but there re-
ally is no term to describe their won-
derful mix of breakbeat, IDM and
glitch-hop.
‘Happy Birthday’, only their second
full-length album, is their most am-
bitious work yet, clocking in at over
70 minutes and featuring numerous

collaborations with top artists. Every
track creates a mini-genre of its own,
from the off-beat party electro of the
title track, to the heavy ragga of “Let
Your Love Grow”, and the old-school
beats of “Wedding Toccata Theme”.
“Black Block” and “Sucker Pin” man-
age to incorporate elements of IDM
whilst remaining awesome dance
tracks.
However, the highlights here are the
sinister hip-hop “Dark Side of the Sun”,
featuring badass puppet-rap crew Pup-
petmastaz, and their brooding collabo-
ration with über-fan Thom Yorke, “The
White Flash”.
The album is a flawless listen and
more importantly, an essential record
for lovers of all types of electronic
music.
