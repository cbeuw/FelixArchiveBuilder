COFFEE BREAK
Horoscopes as they bloody should be- so bum sex off
I write these, not you. The sooner you learn that and go back to touching your sister inappropriately the better
Cancer
For the past six
months I’ve been
campaigning to have
this star sign renamed
to Stupid Talentless
Annoying Syphillis
Ridden Fame Hungry Dog Faced Bitch. Stasrfhd
doesn’t roll off the tongue very well so I went for
Jade Goody instead. Apparently this is in ‘bad
taste’ though. Can someone tell me what the fuck
bad taste is?
Virgo
You have always found
it hard to speak to
girls. Everyone you
approach wrinkles and
looks away in disgust.
You can’t understand
every person seems to hate being being in your
company. Have ever considered it is because
you’re a fish? You smell like a sweaty clunge
and flapping around on the floor in a waterless
environment is not attractive either.
Gemini
If you say Fail, Gash,
Izzit or any other
shitty street slang/
Internet speak again
to me again, I swear
I will fuck you up for
good (with a big knife mind, I’m not actually
as hard as I sound). And what’s with the saying
‘butters’? I’m sitting on the bus and some kid
says Tinchy Stryder is ‘butters’. What the fuck
has shitty hip hop got to do with butter?!
Pisces
Your house is liter-
ally falling to pieces. A
leak in the bathroom
has the caused the
kitchen ceiling to fall
in, leaving a massive
hole. At least you can have a chat with whoever’s
cooking dinner whilst you’re on the shitter. Drop
a nice big chocoloate log in the curry. It’ll probably
make it taste better than the crap you cooked on
Wednesday night!
Leo
Madonna? Course you
fucking would! Sure,
she’s over 50 and has
become a man but
she’s still Madonna!
Think hard about it,
you would be fucking Madonna. No? How about
the ginger from Desperate Housewives? No? Not
even our beloved monarch Queen Lizzie? You
boring cunt! You would definately do Jeff Goldb-
lum though? Oh Yeah, thought as much.
Aries
Trying to convert
women to any religion
in a attempt to get
some pussy is a terri-
ble idea but apparently
it’s all the rage these
days. Give it a shot then! ‘Jo Hos’ seem to be the
most experienced so now you have an excuse for
stalking that fittie next door. “Ahem, have you
heard the word of...” Oh fuck this, God is boring.
Go back to trusty Rohypnol, it works every time.
Scorpio
Green Week is soon so
here are some tips to be
eco-friendly: 1) Don’t
use condoms, latex is
non-biodegradeable. 2)
Every person contrib-
utes 17,000 tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere a
year, help this by killing the child after raping it.
3) Rising sea levels will soon flood our coastlines,
let’s relocate Blackpool now...to fucking Mongo-
lia! (Honestly, I do love Tower World)
Libra
Have you ever
wondered which
legend added a ‘p’ to
the Imperial College
sign on the South
Ken underpass. Well
I had the honour of meeting him and today I
exclusively reveal his name. Let me introduce to
you (Drum Roll) Jack Offalot. This is what Jack
had to say about his famous letter: “I thought it
would be...” I couldn’t be arsed to listen after that.
Taurus
Did you catch the
meteor shower this
week? Of course you
didn’t, you live in
the murky shithole
that is Laandan! Well
these shooting stars have serious astrological
consequences for your horoscopes. Good news
is that you’ll finally lose your virginity, bad
news is that you’ll strangle her in your sleep.
Don’t worry mate, we’ve all been there.
Capricorn
I don’t need to tell you
that the Miss Universe
sex tape is some good
shit, you already know.
You happened upon
it whilst innocently
browsing the interweb and it wasn’t long before
your hand was on your cock. 43 seconds later and
with no toliet roll you desperately searched for
somewhere to wipe. Now everyone’s asking where
you got your hairgel from. Pint?
Aquarius
Want some atten-
tion? Why don’t you
piss off the nation’s
farmers by slaughter-
ing all their cattle,
then convince the
whole world they’re going to die from swine
flu. Then top it off by demanding that every
student pays extortionate, lifetime-debt induc-
ing fees whilst pocketing a 370K paycheque
before finally fucking off. Twat.
