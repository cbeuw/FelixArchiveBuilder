pparently I can’t spell,
and judging by last
week’s efforts here that
is something I cannot
dispute. It was like go-
ing back to the days of Mr Ravi Pall,
where each week this space was guar-
anteed to have been filled with incom-
prehensible, poorly spelt drivel. But it
was entertaining, incomprehensible,
poorly spelt drivel! I will do my best to
improve the standard of this editorial,
and I think have managed to formulate
a master plan that Dr. Evil will be proud
of. I am going to actually make an at-
tempt to re-read what I write! This will
however severely dent the amount of
time that I can spend ‘working on my
degree’. And by ‘working on my degree’
I really mean ‘testing out the durability
of the bar’s tables and chairs’. And by
‘testing the durability of the bar’s tables
and chairs’ I quite simply mean getting
a bit tipsy. And by... well, I hope you get
the picture by now.
Moving on to the events of my life
this past week. I have to admit it’s
been a bit up and down really. It was
my birthday- a day I never enjoy too
much. What with all these people who
I haven’t seen for ages bothering me-
maybe there’s a reason why we haven’t
met recently? That being said I man-
aged to get on a 14 or 414 (don’t know
which) bus at South Kensington, going
towards Fulham, only to wake up on a
22 in Waterloo. Not sure how that hap-
pened as I am almost 100% sure I didn’t
get off the bus at any stage. Weird huh?
Seeing as I had a free weekend, I
thought I’d go home to visit my mother
who has been giving me an ear bash-
ing for a few months now. Never before
have I received such a bollocking! The
pinnacle was being told off for eating
too much... Seriously, that is the best
part about going home, you sit down to
dinner, and wow! it’s not pasta. I per-
sonally think she’s gone a tad mental
because when I was young she would
always force feed me potatoes and
meat to ‘build me up’. Or was that just
a sneaky ploy to make the huge pile of
greens look smaller?
Well I hope you’ve enjoyed my (large-
ly correctly spelt) muttering, and if any
of you readers out there would like to
fill this space please do. If you are a girl.
And blond. And willing to give me a
hug. And a kiss. Hockay bai. X
Stuff Imperial students like:
7. Lunch (free):
Yo Davo, you heard about the lec-
ture on counterbalance fuelled
menopause today? No mate, and
it sounds like a pile of horse semen
to be quite frank. You what? Mate,
there’s a free lunch at the end... Oh
sweet as a fucking honey roasted
peanut! It is defiantly worth my
while sitting in a lecture theatre
being talked to by a mentalist in a
shell suit, not understanding liter-
ally a single word spoken, just to get
a free lunch.,
Let’s be honest, we’ve all done it
haven’t we? You have no interest
whatsoever in the subject, but the
fact that you are going to get some
free sandwiches and save yourself
£2 is a big attraction. In my past I’ve
even been to a lecture about PhD
opportunities... in my second year!
Well, you have to keep all your op-
tions open don’t you?

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in
a cell and must be surrounded with
a corresponding number of lines.
Lines cannot split and there can
only be one continuous line. Any
cells with no numbers can have any
number of lines. Look at the solu-
tion above for help.

Harry Potter Trio won. Well done.
Usual crap. Send in results. I have
a headache and I’m hungry. I want
some eggs on toast and a mild gin
and tonic. Moon. Table. Phone.
Screen. Space filled!
