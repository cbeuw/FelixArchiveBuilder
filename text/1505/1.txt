the shiny exterior of Griffon Studios,
cracks appear to have emerged.
A regular complaint from the first
intake of postgraduate students re-
volves around the availability of a
wireless internet connection. Un-
knowing postgrads signed their ten-
ancy agreements for Griffon Studios,
putting their faith in the assurance
by GradPad of “wireless broadband
internet connection throughout the
building – up to 30mb”. Unfortu-
nately it seems so far they have
failed to provide such a reliable ser-
vice. Residents have reported the
internet, both wired and wireless, to
be “dysfunctional”. Upon complaint,
StudentCom informed the residents
that they did not anticipate the vol-
ume of mobile devices, expecting

The Christmas holidays approach,
signalling the end of the first term
for the residents in the new Griffon
Studios. The new halls of residence,
branded a part of accommodation op-
tion provider GradPad, opened this
October exclusively for postgraduate
students. Located south of the river
in Battersea, it boasts “affordable,
secure and high quality accommo-
dation”. It emulates top-notch stu-
dent living; over 450 modern studio
apartments with wireless internet,
free gym on site, large social space
with plasma TVs, and a host of shops
within five minutes walk. But has
this ‘GradPad’ lived up to all of these
claims? Upon investigation beneath

most of the students to stay plugged
into the internet, despite advertis-
ing claims made online. StudentCom
have since been working to provide
more IP addresses in order to im-
prove the service.
In addition to these problems, a
resident informed Felix that one of
the two lifts in Block A, which serves
ten floors, was out of service for over
a month. Putting this into perspec-
tive, that is more than a third of the
tenancy so far. The break down of
washing machines is also reported
frequently. Again in Block A, one
of the three washing machines was
out of order for a week at the end of
October, with a second also failing.
This left one washing machine for
the 225 studios in the block. Heating
of the flats has been highly variable
– with reports that some studios have
no heating.
As a result, the experience for
some has not matched the high prices
of rent and the “high-quality” prom-
ised by John Anderson, the Chief
Executive Officer of the Imperial
College Fund who invested jointly in
the project with Berkeley First. Orig-
inally there were two price brackets
differing by the size of studio, £235
for 19sq metres and £300 for 22sq
metres. Early in October it was dis-
covered by residents that a new low-
er price bracket had been included
for 11 of the 452 studios at £195 for
19sq metres with half-sized win-
dows. This was met by speculation
