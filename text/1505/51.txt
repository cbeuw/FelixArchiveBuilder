Wordoku
YES, THE WORDOKU IS BACK WITH A CHRISTMAS
BANG!
The traditional wordoku has every row, column and 3x3
box containing one letter each. the edn result is arather
useless word or phrase that appears in one of the rows or
columns.
This time, however, one letter appears twice and only
twice in each row, column and 3x3 box. Little curve ball
for you there...

Welcome to another round
of cryptograms. Each let-
ter has been encoded so it
stands for a different letter.
In the end, a poignant quote
and the person who said it
will appear.

MERRY
CHRISTMAS
EVERYONE!
It’s been a pleasure doing the
puzzles and seeing everyone
send in solutions every week
(especially the cryptic cross-
words, which I struggle to solve
despite creating them!) and
the banter that comes with it.
And a Christmas present to you
all from puzzles as a reward...
a scribble space??? YES!
We’ll call it a create-your-own
puzzles section.
