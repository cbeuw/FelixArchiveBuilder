The Student Online Evaluation (SOLE)
Survery is designed to gather information
from undergraduate students on their
lecture modules in the term that has
passed. It provides vital information
for students, staff and the Union; this
information allows us to acknowledge
courses which are well run, and address
issues which need to be taken care of.
SOLE runs once a term and is one of
the few chances you will get to give
constructive, anonymous feedback on
lectures and labs that will help mould your
course for future students. It only takes
a few minutes to make a real difference,
so do the right thing....fill in SOLE at
www.imperial.ac.uk/SOLE (plus the
top three departments with the highest
participation get money for their DepSoc).
Student Representation
You may have seen the “You Said, We
Did” posters around campus asking
you to fill in SOLE. But even though I’m
trying to convince you to all do SOLE,
it’s important to bear in mind that SOLE
has helped improve the teaching of
your course, but not the wider student
experience. All of the improvements to
the student experience seen on these
posters come directly from Student
Representation.
SOLE is just one part of student
representation, focused on improving
lectures and labs. The other, hugely
significant, way for us to improve
our student experience via Student
Representation is by fully utilising our Year
and Dep Reps.
If you can think of something to improve
not only your own, but also future
students experience at Imperial College
contact your year rep and/or dep rep
to make sure it’s discussed at Student-
Staff Committees, from which your
recommendation can be enacted on.
If you don’t believe me, read the posters
for examples. They include providing
your timetables on your Imperial Outlook,
getting microwaves in departments for
students to use, getting reading weeks,
spacing out exams more, getting Apple
iMacs for app development, getting more
social spaces, getting more computer
rooms and more!
None of these changes would’ve been
possible without Student Representation.
So make sure you’re fully utilising the year
and dep rep positions and make sure you
fill in SOLE before it closes on Friday 16th
December.
