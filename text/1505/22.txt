I
’ve been thinking about boots re-
cently… is the campest opener I
could have written, but it’s true.
I’ve thought about how amaz-
ing they are, and how everyone
should have a pair. I mean trainers are
fine, but they’re just not as versatile. If
you want trainers, by the way, definitely
go for NikeiD’s. You can make them
reflect your personality a lot more, and
waste a lot of time perfecting them. The
knowledge that you could quite possibly
be the only person with that pair of train-
ers is also key to their appeal. Even aca-

have been

The
idea of almost unlimited customisation is
so good that other companies have stolen
it, and, as we all know, it’s only the best
ideas that are stolen.

It is likely that that
last joke will be deemed to in-jokey, and
so I apologise.

So, back to boots. The reason they are
amazing is that they are simultaneously
casual and comfortable while being
smarter than your average trainer. You
can wear them everyday, without looking
overdressed for lectures; unlike normal
shoes, which can end up looking incon-
gruously formal with certain outfits.
To be slightly more specific, brown
boots are definitely a must if you ask
me (please understand that I am defi-
nitely not talking about Ugg boots, I can-
not stress that enough). Pressed to give
more detail, I would say that the slightly
weathered dark brown variety are my
personal favourite.
Black boots are fine and can be worn
with any pair of jeans, but they’re just
more discrete and there’s not as much
variation between different pairs. You

They are totally boots-iful
may be able to wear them with a certain
colour of jeans you like, but you sacrifice
the range of choice that other boots can
give you. If something’s black, it needs
to be pretty special to be disguisable
from something else that’s black. Well,
okay, I may be exaggerating a bit, there is
variation, but it’s hard to actually see un-
til you’re up close. I’ll attempt to explain
what I mean; at the distance between your
head and someone’s shoes (the usual dis-
tance you see boots at) all black boots
look pretty similar.

Even when, for me

that distance isn’t as far as I would like it
to be.

If I’m honest, I would advise you
to get both black and brown boots. I just
don’t want to be blamed for encouraging
irresponsible spending.
When I was shopping around for boots,
I went everywhere. I even went to the
high-end shops, although, unfortunately,
my student loan doesn’t really extend
that far

, so I was only looking to see
what they would be like. To be honest,
they weren’t anything special. They were
either bland and uninspiring or just not
what I was looking for (at a price I was
never really willing to pay). In the end, I
found that your standard high street shops
really are the best bet. River Island is my
personal favourite as they have a decent
range of boots at a reasonable price tag.
All Saints are okay, but they’re all over
£100 for something you really can get
elsewhere. Although, being a man, I’m
slightly unsure of how much they should
be. How do I know what’s a reasonable
price for something that I’ve never paid
for before? The only solution seems to
be to shop around. Eventually, you will
realise that, in general, All Saints are a
rip off, and this isn’t limited to their boot
section. Their boots also look as if they

nstinctively, we all admire the
‘good’ things in humankind –
compassion, honesty and justice.
Our free will to actively pursue
such attributes through our ac-
tions is arguably what gives us our worth
as human beings. But have you ever
considered the lengths you go to in or-
der to stand by what you believe is right?
Would you die for the sake of freedom?
Malcolm X once said: ‘If you’re not
ready to die for it, take the word ‘free-
dom’ out of your vocabulary.’
One remarkable man has touched the
lives of many, including Charles Dick-
ens, Gandhi and Antoine Bara. Hus-
sein! Born in 5th century Arabia, he
was known for his tremendous generos-
ity and kindness. Being the grandson of
the Prophet Mohammed (pbuh), and the
apple of his eye, he was a prominent and
cherished figure amongst early Muslims.
Yet, Hussein and his family were massa-
cred in cold blood, on the day of Ashura,
on the orders of, ironically enough, the
Muslim Caliph of the time, Yazid I.
Why? Yazid was a tyrannical leader.
He was known to rape, imprison and
steal; he was swift to silence those who
dared question his legitimacy as Caliph.
Through propaganda and fear-monger-
ing, he was able to assume power, and
many people felt there was no choice but
to accept him as leader. Hussein, on the
other hand, was a man who believed in
dignity and freedom; he refused to pay
allegiance to Yazid, a person who had
little respect for his fellow man. Despite
the oppressive pressure mounted against
him and the almost certain promise of
being killed, Hussein remained defiant
in his stance and famously said – ‘Death
with dignity is better than life with hu-
miliation.’
In the year 680AD, Hussein, his fami-
ly, and 72 of his companions found them-
selves stranded on the desolate plains
of Karbala (in modern day Iraq). They
were surrounded by Yazid’s army of at
least 5000 men, who had their water sup-
ply, the Euphrates River, cut-off. On the
Caliph’s orders, a brief battle of several
hours commenced, ending in the killing
of Hussein, and all the men in his camp.
The remaining women and children were
taken as prisoners of war. Yet amongst
all this carnage and destruction, a revo-
lution had ignited. The words of Søren
Kierkegaard could not be more relevant:
“The tyrant dies and his rule is over; the
have been designed purely for the use of
JLS and The Wanted.
In conclusion, go to River Island, buy
a pair of boots and wear them with pride.
Having re-read this, I feel I should do
something manly. So, I’m off to drink
pints and chant about my credentials as
a Zulu warrior.

martyr dies and his rule begins.”
The Battle of Karbala, in statistical
terms, was hardly significant, but the
story of Hussein’s sacrifice has inspired
people for centuries. Hussein’s message
is universal and ever-resonate, because
it embodies liberation and renounces
injustice. Mahatma Gandhi once said –
‘I learned from Hussein how to achieve
victory whilst being oppressed.’ To-
day, several million people converge
at Karbala to commemorate the day of
Ashura. Undeterred by the very real
threat of violence and terror, they come
to relive and replay the message of a very
distinct, free human being.

Week from the 12th – 17th December.
