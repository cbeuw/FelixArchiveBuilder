second places behind strong crews in
the elite quad (Laura Greenhalgh/Mel
Wilson/Mathilde Pauls/Klara Weaver)
and Intermediate 1 coxed four (Rosa
Atkinson/Louise Connell/Hannah Pat-
terson/Chloe Symmonds/cox: Libby
Richards). Further top three places
were taken in the Intermediate 1 quad
(Tim Richards/Tom Pearson/Mark Pat-
terson/Alex Gillies), the Intermediate 1
coxed four, in spite of only having had
3 outings together before the race (Jack
Cadman/Will Todd/Pierre Thomas/Leo
Carrington/cox: Connie Pidoux), and
the women’s elite four (Lucinda Goo-
derham/Amy Propsting/Lizzie Cottrell/
Cloudy Carnegie).
It is not just the senior squad that have
been out defending IC’s honour on the
river. This year, the boat club has had a
good intake of novices of both guys and
girls. With the new experiences of sit-
ting in “tubs”, learning to row and how
to erg properly, the novices have come
on leaps and bounds since starting in
October and at the end of November
were given their first true taste of row-
ing – racing! A coach of rowers, coxes
and coaches made their way to Cam-
bridge early one morning. In between
the getting lost in Cambridgeshire,
boat-stopping crabs, rushed boating,
blade clashing and unexpected bank
landings, the novices coped brilliantly
and made the most of the day with a
trip to Belushi’s in the evening.
The final race of the season, Scullers’
Head, was held on Saturday and once
again ICBC performed spectacularly
with five of the top ten places taken by
Imperial athletes. Adam Freeman-Pask
won the event, despite receiving a pen-
alty for “unsportsmanly behaviour”.
Adam is now officially Tideway king,
having also won the Wingfield Sculls
race when he smashed an “unbeatable”
record by 17s. Sam Scrimgeour took
5th place overall while racing with
someone else’s blades after his broke
on the journey up to the start. Intra-club
rivalry was rife as Wilf Kimberley, Hal
Bradbury and Josh Butler came 8th,
9th and 10th overall, with less than 5s
separating them. Tim Richards contin-
ued to build on earlier form in the sea-
son and won the Novice category (15th
overall).
As well as cracking results through
the autumn, ICBC have played as hard
as they’ve trained with after-race par-
ties galore. The infamous toga party
continues to draw a big crowd and
this year saw the first annual ICBC vs.
ICSMBC pub crawl with “boat races”
between men’s 1st, women’s 1st, men’s
novices and women’s novices (some
serious practise may be required in this
area…). Preparation for next term is al-
ready in full swing as the focus moves
to bigger boats, BUCS, Eights Heads of
the River and the Henley Regattas.
Silverware galore for
ICBC in first term

Men’s and Women’s fencers make
progress in BUCS knockouts

Fencing
Imperial’s fencing teams produced
a solid set of results last week in the
BUCS knockout championships to en-
sure their progress to the quarter-finals.
Only the Men’s Seconds suffered an
unfortunate loss at the hands of Aberys-
twyth, having made the somewhat epic
journey all the way to the West coast of
Wales. The Men’s Firsts and Women’s
Seconds were both hosting matches at
Ethos, against Keele Firsts and Oxford
seconds respectively.
The Women’s Firsts were away to UCL
– not a huge distance to travel. In the
event they won the match, 133-96, and
now face Bristol in the quarters of the
Championship.
In Prince’s gardens, the men made short
work of Keele, coming out 135-81 vic-
tors and booking a place versus Durham
in the next stage of the competition.
The Women’s Seconds had the easiest
win of all, though, as their opponents
failed to send a team. Bring on the rest!.
