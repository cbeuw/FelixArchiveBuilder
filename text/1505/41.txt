Give your gifts in style
Saskia Verhagen and Alice Yang bring you this Christmas’ most fashionable presents
For those men that need a gentle prod in the right
direction (let’s face it, most could use a little help),
this stylish man’s bible features tips from how to
buy a suit, to business etiquette, international
superstitions and essential films one must have
seen – plus there’s an entire chapter dedicated to
chivalry. And there was I thinking chivalry had well
and truly seen its last day well before my lifetime.
But in the words of Theodore Roosevelt, quoted in
the inside cover: “Courtesy is as much a mark of a
gentleman as courage.” Didn’t I tell you? Essential
reading for all those with a Y-chromosome. -SV

A scarf may seem like a typical Christmas present,
but being Liberty’s and being 100% silk, Liberty
London Collection scarves are anything but ordi-
nary.
Pamper that much loved woman in your life with
this beautiful gift inspired by British winter gar-
dens, featuring prints from jewelled toned peacock
feathers, to monochrome orchids, and vibrant wild
flowers. There are even online tutorials for the
many different ways they can be worn: as hair-
bands, in braids and as turbans… this isn’t just
any scarf; this is a Liberty’s scarf. -AY
Dearest female-friends, should you be feeling on
the generous side this Christmas, why not buy
your male-counterpart something a bit more spe-
cial? Yes, of course, feel free to splash out on a
Rolex, but hey, that’s just a tad bit mainstream
don’t you think? So why not go for this stunning
timepiece instead? This leather strapped watch
oozes of the perfect gentleman with a sense of
heritage and respect for exceptional style; plus,
we can bet the look on his face whilst watching
those cogs turn will be a sight you don’t want to
miss. -AY

The ultimate in classic handbags, the Chanel 2.55
is a dream gift for almost any girl. Crafted from the
softest lambskin, and drenched in the most formi-
dable history of Coco herself (the chain handle is
said to be inspired by bracelets the nuns wore at
the convent she grew up in, and the inside pocket
was for her love letters), you can keep your ‘it’
bags of the moment because this beautiful little
piece of fashion history, first made in February
1955 will never, ever date. If your budget stretches
this far, this is a gift that no girl could turn her
nose up at. -SV
To match your girl’s shiny red Chanel, the ultimate
vintage car truly blows the budget. The last one
bought in the UK was that by DJ Chris Evans, a well-
known collector of classic cars, which went for some-
where around the £12 million mark. The car (which,
as a Ferrari, must be red) was originally produced be-
tween 1962-64, when only 39 cars were produced
– hence the hefty price tag – though originally they
were sold for $18,000, to customers especially ap-
proved by Enzo Ferrari himself. I doubt he would have
approved of Chris Evans driving this masterpiece.
Something to ponder another time perhaps. -SV

If you’re shopping for a girl who likes to pretend
she’s a Princess, dreams of flowing gowns and
pours over the pages of Vogue, Dior Couture is THE
book to gift her with. Like a fairy-tale picture book,
this is 250 pages of fashion history with designs
from Christian Dior himself, Yves Saint Laurent,
Marc Bohan, and of course, John Galliano. Hun-
dreds of to-die-for dresses delicately captured by
the famous photographer Patrick Demarchelier, on
some of world’s most beautiful top models, in some
of the world’s most stunning locations; there’s no
going wrong. -AY
A guy’s wallet is the holder of his life, yet too many
guys have fallen down the trap of “boring black wal-
let” or even worse, “I’ve had this polyester wallet
since I was 10”. It’s prime time we helped turn our
boys into men, and smart sophisticated, stylish men
at that – what better place to start than a good sturdy
smooth leather wallet? This particular one by Aspinal
of London is dark enough to be subtle, yet still shows
character and screams quality. Whether it’s a brother,
best friend, boyfriend, or God forbid, father, show the
man in your life that they deserve the best, and give
them a gift that will never leave their side. -AY

A completely unique gift inspired by Leonardo him-
self, and beautifully crafted by one of our own (An-
nabel St John-Lyle, Year 4 MechEng), these cross-
body necklaces lend a downtown-chic touch to
the plainest of outfits. Worn over a white tee, or
a black dress, this simple little accessory reminis-
cent of vintage Angelica Huston, is perfect for the
girl who has almost everything. Five different styles
are sold, each featuring a different central motif,
and with £5 off for the Christmas season only, the
chains are being sold for only £12-15, truthfully a
steal for every budget. -SV
