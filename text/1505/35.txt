rating this year’s best films
Rising Star Award:
Michael Fassbender
Following critical hits Hunger and Fish
Tank, Fassbender is quickly rising in the
film industry as one of the most bankable,
dedicated performers around. He was
oddly chilling, yet appealing, as Rochester
in Jane Eyre, he added layers of intensity
and anger to Magneto in X-Men: First Class,
his restrained performance in A Danger-
ous Method was a fascinating one, and his
top-notch performance as a sex addict in
Shame is already generating much awards
buzz after his Best Actor win at the Venice
Film Festival. All of this in a single year. A
rising star indeed.
Special Award:
Andy Serkis
Serkis may never win an Oscar for his role
in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, but his
motion-capture performance is such a
mesmerising piece of cinema acting that
we just could not stand not acknowledg-
ing him for an award. If you watch some
of the “making-of” footage for Rise of the
Planet of the Apes, you will see that not
only are his postures perfectly captured,
but also his subtle facial expression. He
virtually has no words to say, but he still
manages to deliver something so power-
ful in his incredibly detailed and dedicated
performance.
Rising Star Award:
Jessica Chastain
It’s hard to know where to begin with Chas-
tain. Virtually unknown in 2010, a year later,
she’s possibly one of the most talked-about
actresses around, thanks to a number of
films (The Help, The Debt, The Tree of Life,
Take Shelter) being released within months
of one another. She gives varied perfor-
mances in very different films, the kind of
versatility a lot of actresses struggle to
achieve in a lifetime. Her presence is felt in
all the films she has starred in, and the gen-
uinely talented actress will hopefully have a
glowing career, with her résumé padded like
never before.
Special Award:
Woody Allen
It takes a unique kind of genius to write and
direct every year – and Allen is that man. He
attracts the starriest ensembles, picks the
perfect locations, shoots with his tradition-
al modest style, and somehow manages
to produce embracing romantic-comedies.
He makes hiccups here and there, but who
doesn’t? For a man who has given us more
than forty films over his distinguished ca-
reer, Allen shows a high level of consistency
in his work, and is most certainly an excep-
tional gem of a director/writer.
Film of the Year:
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
It’s a great-looking, well-acted, smartly-
written, completely absorbing spy drama,
and its slow, patient pace works as a great
advantage. It’s layered with so much depth
and detail that it does the great John Le
Carré’s novel justice. The highly underrated
Gary Oldman falls beautifully into the role of
George Smiley, whose mission is to identify
a Soviet mole hidden in the high levels of
British Secret Service. It’s a complex ride
but completely worth paying attention to; a
triumph in every sense.
Brit Film of the Year:
Deathly Hallows – Part 2
It took ten years, eight films, millions of dol-
lars, and hundreds of cast and crew to get
the final film of the Harry Potter franchise
absolutely right. There is action, magic and
most importantly, heart. With actors hav-
ing matured into their roles over the years,
and a faultless supporting cast boasting
some famous English names, the finale to
the most successful series in the history
of cinema is a more than satisfying one, a
real British triumph, and something every
generation can embrace with pride.
