U
nless you’ve been glued
to your library desk,
you’ve probably seen
the rows of fluorescent
bulbs hanging over the
streets of London and thought, “is it
that time of year already?” Sure, they
light up the street a little more, and
let’s face it, we need that at a time
of year when it gets dark at 4pm, but
there must be more to it than that,
right?
What if they signify something
that lights up more than just the high
street? Could they represent a light
that illuminates a whole city, country,
or even the whole world? Could they
even be an image of a light that illu-
minates the whole of our existence –
past, present and future? It sounds cra-
zy, I know. Maybe Macbeth was right:
“out, out, brief candle! Life is a tale,
told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing?” What I’m hinting
at is a promise made before the begin-
ning of time, with implications that
run further into the future than even a
PhD physicist can imagine; a promise
brought to light that first Christmas.
That first Christmas was nothing
like ours. Most of us shell out our
student loans to buy people gifts that
they probably don’t want – I know I do
anyway. We all end up having to fake
that look of surprise and awe when we
receive presents that don’t turn out to
be that iPad 2 we wanted so badly. But
what if we got something much better
for Christmas? Something worth im-
measurably more than we can imag-

There’s something about Christmas
What are the lights for?
ine; something that even the richest
person couldn’t afford to give, which
would never wear out and you’d never
get tired of. Is that what Christmas is
all about – presents that knock those
new holly adorned socks off your feet?
We all know Christmas isn’t really
about presents. It’s about spending
time with your family: the people who
give you full acceptance the moment
you walk in the door, as if you were
never away. It’s about catching up
with all that’s been going on, with ev-
erything you’ve missed on your fam-
ily Skype sessions and those calls you
got from your parents while you were
in Sainsbury’s. But that is hardly akin
to the first Christmas now is it? I mean
they didn’t have Skype 2000 years
ago, in a time when people barely
left their home town, there was never
much catching up to do with family.
Hang on a second. Maybe Christmas
really is about our catching up with
family, and awesome presents and
bright lights, which illuminate our
existence. That could be what the first
Christmas was all about.
Imagine Macbeth going up into his
Attic to find his Author. Where would
Macbeth find the light which makes
sense of his whole story – brief can-
dles, murdering wives and all? But
what if Shakespeare wrote himself
into his own story, and stepped onto
the stage in his own play? Just imag-
ine for a moment that the child that
was born, Jesus, was also God him-
self writing himself into history. Why
would God do that? The first Hebrew
T
he entire final quarter of
the year snowballs to-
wards the 25th of Decem-
ber with the unstoppable
momentum of an ava-
lanche on a skateboard. Even by No-
vember, the excitement runs at fever
pitch levels. In fact, there is a spike in
A&E admissions that coincides with
the first screening of the Coca Cola ad-
vert. Even after seeing it for so many
years previously, I had to have a lie
down with a stiff drink afterwards.
There are so many things that
make Christmas… Christmas. Mince
pies and mulled wine, carol singing,
Christmas shopping and all the events
that follow: all little quirks and tradi-
tions that make this time of the year so
special, so magical.
Except they don’t. A mince pie is
nothing more than pastry, fruit and
brandy. Carols are just songs and
hymns that no one lets you sing at any
other time of the year – much like any-
thing by ABBA really. The only dif-
ference between braving the heaving
masses at this time of the year com-
pared to any other is that we have a
strangely increased tolerance for it.
There is nothing special about any
of these things. There is no magic to
Christmas. It is all utterly meaning-
less. Much like the sum of all human
experience. Ugh, how grim. I feel like
I’m in a Frank Capra movie.
If there’s anything special about
Christmas, it’s people. Oh, I know
there are people all year round – in
London I can’t seem to escape them.
But the way people act at Christmas
is interesting to say the least. In this
wintry season, the evidence is great-
est that we are living in a cold and, at
best, uncaring Universe. Yet, instead
of rallying against the darkness, we
sing carols to it.
We take random chemical signals
from a world malevolent to our exis-
tence and somehow try to make sense
of things. The revolution of the Earth
around the Sun is a thing of beauty.
Watching some overgrown boys kick a
ball about sweeps people away on the
wings of passion. Despite having no
reason for it, I am rather keen to pre-
serve my life and deprive that leopard
outside my window of his next meal.
The fact that we can enjoy life de-
spite its meaningless makes us rather
curious creatures. It is us who say that
mince pies and mulled wine are spe-
cial and can only be consumed at this
time of year. It is us that enjoy carols.
It is us who, if not enjoy, then suffer
through Christmas shopping so we
can bring joy to the people in our lives
who we have decided are so important
to us.
Christians understood it was because
“He is not ashamed to call them broth-
ers. Since the children have flesh and
blood, he too shared in their human-
ity so that by his death he might break
the power of him who holds the power
of death – that is, the devil”. I think
that is the present. The end of death it-
self. How can we do anything but live
when death has lost its power? So we
have life. Forever.
I think that changes things, that
sheds some real light, not just on
Christmas, but on where all our lives
are heading. But you know what I love
more than a good present? The person
who gives it. God has come to earth
so that we can really know him; the
bible even says that when we accept
There is absolutely nothing magical
about Christmas, except the magic that
we decide it has. The fact that there
is a time of the year that we have set
aside to come together and share our
silly traditions is a little bit special.
I think people get fooled by Christ-
mas. They think that Christmas is all
about gorging yourself on turkey and
other middle eastern states/fowl, ice-
skating at the Natural History Museum
and sledding down the hill on the first
snow of the season. These all mean
nothing. They think that is where the
magic is but it is just a ruse for people
to get together: to share close commu-
nion and fellowship. That is where the
real magic is.
There’s something about Christmas,
isn’t there? Somehow in the coldest of
weathers, we can share with one an-
other the warmest of hearts.
Merry Christmas, one and all!
I think it’s time to
really get to know
the God that gives
us the ultimate
gift, to catch up
with He who has
broken into history.
his gift we are adopted into his family
and become his children. I think it’s
time to really get to know the God that
gives us the ultimate gift, to catch up
with He who has broken into history.
That is what I shall be thinking about
as I look up to those lights strung
across London; as I give and receive
gifts and as I catch up with my family
back home. The last verse of the carol
Once in Royal David’s City sums it up
perfectly:
And our eyes at last shall see Him,
Through His own redeeming love;
For that Child so dear and gentle,
Is our Lord in heaven above:
And He leads His children on,
To the place where He is gone.
Yeah, he thinks he has a lot of work around this time of year. Slacker
