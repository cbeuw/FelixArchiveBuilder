Results from Egypt’s first stage
of Parliamentary elections sug-
gests Islamist parties will take
two thirds of seats. Though run
offs will eventually determine dis-
tribution, the moderate Islamist
Freedom and Justice Party and
the radical Salafi Islamist Al Nour
Party are clearly dominant. This
means the new constitution and
legal framework is likely to have
strong Islamic influences includ-
ing implementation of Shariah law.
The results have caused alarm in
Israel, where Egypt’s previous dic-
tator, Mubarak, maintained good
relations. Coptic Christians, who
make up between 10-15% of the
population, are particularly ner-
vous that Egypt could become the
new Iran and many are planning to
leave the country.
The BBC has received over
30,000 complaints about Top
Gear presenter Jeremy Clark-
son’s comments on the One
Show. Clarkson and the BBC
have apologized for the com-
ments, which included mention
of people who commit suicide
by jumping under trains being
‘selfish’ (which they kind of are,
right?) and the most conten-
tious point: Clarkson’s view that
people striking should be shot
(a prison sentence clearly be-
ing more appropriate). Despite
leader of the opposition Ed Mil-
liband also condemning him,
intelligent people everywhere
agreed that Clarkson is a bit
of a douchebag but was clearly
joking when making his remarks
live on air.

GermanChancellorAngelaMerkel
and French President Nicholas
Sarkozy made it clear that the
EU treaty would be changed at a
meeting last Friday – regardless
of British Prime Minister David
Cameron’s opposition. Sarkozy
had tried to convince Cameron to
drop his insistence on repatria-
tion of powers from Belgium in
exchange for supporting a tighter
fiscal union. However, the Ger-
man leader has said that a new
treaty will be signed, whether it
be between all 27 members or
just the Eurozone 17. This leaves
Cameron the choice of being
isolated from Europe or support-
ing the treaty and being isolated
from his party, who are demand-
ing a referendum on any changes
to the EU treaty.
Vladimir Putin’s party looks set to
lose its two thirds majority in the
450 seat State Duma, Russia’s
lower house. The two thirds of
seats had allowed United Russia
to change the constitution so Pu-
tin can become president for two
six year terms. The fall from 64%
to fewer than 50% of the popular
vote is particularly embarrass-
ing given widespread allegations
of fraud. However, since parties
with fewer than 7% of votes can-
not take seats, United Russia will
still hold a majority in the parlia-
ment.
