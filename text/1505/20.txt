This week professors from various insti-
tutions across the UK outlined their fears
regarding the higher education White Pa-
per in a letter, in particular highlighting
a perceived move that the Paper could
lead to: a US-style higher education pri-
vate sector that would see for-profit com-
panies becoming able to acquire strug-
gling universities. Claiming that one of
the negative consequences of such a
move would be “crushing levels of debt”,
the conclusion that the academics have
reached deserves at least some analysis,
especially considering the ongoing debt
situation that graduates already face.
Critics may initially point out that the
letter is simply a knee-jerk reaction to the
changes outlined by the White Paper by
academics unwilling to adapt to the crea-
tion of a form of higher education market,
a market that would be responsive to the
needs of the student and would potential-
ly lead to far more dynamic changes than
we see at present. However, studying the
grievances of the professors further sees
significant worry towards an American
system of for-profit business.
However, there is always a possibility
that the private sector could allow univer-
sities access to greater resources than
we can find at present. After all, alumni
fundraising at UK universities pales sig-
nificantly in comparison to institutions in
the US. Help from the private sector, de-
spite danger from the shareholder, could
be immeasurably more profitable than at
present.
Another comment that the academics
make concerns the fact that a move to-
wards a higher education private sector
would see a heavy burden on the taxpay-
er, as well as the indebted student. Yet
the taxpayer, as we are reminded by the
past government-subsided system and
fierce critics of the proposals of the cur-
rent government, currently foots the bill
for university degrees across the country.
We are heading inexorably towards
£9,000 fees next year. For better or for
worse, and whatever your own personal
opinion on the government’s proposals,
we will begin to at least have a better
idea of the new worth of a degree under
our current system once the new intake
of students begin next year. Concerned
academics such as those who signed the
letter to The Daily Telegraph will likely
have to wait and see whether the new
fees will lead to an American system. At
the very least, we must have faith in the
current system and the focus on financial
support that we continue to enjoy.

I
discovered a game called Bal-
derdash at a dinner party last
week (I can feel the mid-life
beckoning me already – damn).
For those of you unaware of
the game, it essentially involves mak-
ing things up to trick people. A player
reads something off a card; an acro-
nym, a name, a law, or something
else of that nature. The other players
then have to write down a response;
what the acronym stands for, why the
name is (supposedly) famous, that
sort of thing. Answers are collected
and read out by the individual who
originally wrote the card. Following
this the players pick what they believe
to be the correct response and duly
advance around the board if they’re
right. Some of the answers really
were absurd; I wish I could provide
some examples but they have eluded
me somewhat (maybe it’s that middle
aged thing again). In essence, you do
well in this game by writing bullshit
that’s believable. I’ve used the word
‘bullshit’ because I really don’t think
any other word would portray exactly
what I’m trying to say in this article
(advanced apologies for the overuse
of that particular word).
What has struck me since playing
Balderdash is how much nonsense I
see and hear every day. It would ap-
pear as if there are two reasons why
someone might bullshit (excluding to
win a game of Balderdash, of course);
first off we have the “cry-for-atten-
tion” bullshit. I’ve given it that name
because, let’s face it, everyone knows
someone who bullshits for attention
due to insecurities – and even if it usu-
ally works it doesn’t make you any
less pathetic. It may involve deciding
to sleep on the floor of a lecture the-
atre during a lecture so that people can
notice you and think: “ooh they must
be really tired” or, more likely, “what
a twat”. It could also involve talking
loudly about how much you’ve been
bench pressing in Ethos. Yeah, great,
you have big pectorals. Good for you.
The other type of rubbish that has
been somewhat prominent as of recent
is the “I have no idea what I’m talking
about” type (I may regret saying that).
Why do people open their mouths
when all that prevails are nonsensi-
cal, ill-thought out, feeble and often
contradictory attempts at coherent be-
liefs? You may or may not have seen
or heard about a video on YouTube
called ‘My Tram Experience’ (ap-
proximately 48 hours after uploading
it had close to 3.5 million views). The
passengers of aforementioned tram all
bear witness to a white, 34 year old,
probably drunk or drugged up woman
with her child sitting on one knee.
The mother is ejecting racist remarks
like a torrent of vomit. Admittedly
it’s not the worst video I’ve seen in
terms of racism; in fact, it’s some-
what tame compared to EDL member
‘Cobz Smith’ attacking Asians on the
tube for no apparent reason other than
their place of origin. Nevertheless,
it doesn’t exactly make for pleasant
viewing.
This woman clearly had no idea
what she was on about. After accost-
ing another woman because of her
skin colour she fumbled around for
words like Ed Miliband in a union dis-
pute, telling her to “go back to where
you come from, so back to Sib... fuck-
ing Nig... N*****agua”. I assume she
meant Nicaragua. Following this she
spewed out the following: “You ain’t
fucking British! Fuck off! You ain’t
British, you’re black! You’re black!
You ain’t British, you’re black!”. So
it turns out that being black and being
British are mutually exclusive events.
Apparently.
This whole Jeremy Clarkson issue
is a load of rubbish as well. It sad-
dens me how the journalism industry
completely misconstrues a situation to
make ‘news’. If you watch the whole
interview you can tell that in typical
Balderdash and other lies
George Barnett
This is a Christmas themed article. See, lying is really easy
Jeremy Clarkson fashion he wasn’t
being the slightest bit serious and it’s
safe to say that if Jeremy were to be
presented with a gun, a private sector
striker and their family, no one would
get shot. Some people may not see the
funny side of what Jeremy said (which
isn’t surprising as it was taken out of
context) and consider it to be bullshit
– that’s fine – but then again does it
really matter that you think he’s talk-
ing a load of rubbish? Karen Jennings,
assistant general secretary of UNISON
likened how Clarkson had spoken to
“almost like Gaddafi would have spo-
ken about demonstrators” going on to
call it “an incitement to hatred”. I’m
sorry, but that really is just a load of
bollocks.
So how do I feel about all of this: ‘My
Tram Experience’, the media outburst
over Clarkson and bullshit in general?
I honestly don’t care. The woman on
the tram spoke pure bollocks. If I were
on the same tram I would have done as
few of the other passengers did – sat
there and ignored it. And the ridiculous
media frenzy resulting from Clark-
son’s comments on the One Show?
They’re a load of rubbish, so I’m ig-
noring them too. Much like I choose to
ignore people who cry for attention in
various ways – because, quite simply
put, they exude bullshit.
