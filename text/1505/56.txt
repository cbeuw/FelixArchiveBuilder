mperial College Boat Club has
started the academic year with
some incredible results. From
the outset, Imperial students,
both past and present, have
shown strength in depth across the
men’s and women’s squads and brought
home the silverware to prove it.
The first race of the season was
Pairs’ Head of the River in early Oc-
tober. ICBC began as they meant to
go on, with six category wins as well
as the fastest overall time of the day
from alumnus and GB rower, Adam
Freeman-Pask, and his doubles partner
Jamie Kirkwood. Imperial crews were
also the second, third and fifth fastest
pairs overall with three more category
wins provided by Josh Butler and Mark
Patterson, Danny Bellion and Matt
Monteith, and Ali Hudson and Leo
Carrington respectively. The women’s
squad also set the standard high for this
year. Two further pots were brought
back to the boathouse as Hester Good-
sell took half the win for Imperial in the
elite mixed doubles and Chloe Sym-
monds and Helen Wood won their cat-
egory, only being beaten by elite pairs.
At BUCS Small Boats Head in Bos-
ton, Lincolnshire, athletes were hoping
to shine in front of the GB selectors and
did not fail to disappoint. Ergo personal
bests were beaten by several club mem-
bers and, despite the usual tough condi-
tions on the water, more medals were
won. Cloudy Carnegie and Hannah
Patterson brought home the gold in the
women’s pair, while Tim Richards and
Tom Pearson took silver in the light-
weight double and Hal Bradbury and
Ben Spencer Jones took bronze in the
double, between them accumulating 26
BUCS points in the process.
Despite an incredibly tough field in
the Fours’ Head of the River on bon-
fire night, with many past and future
Olympians racing, Imperial still man-
aged to make their mark. The Inter-
mediate 2 coxed four (Jonny Rankin/
Rory Sullivan/Ben Spencer Jones/Ali
Hudson/cox: Jess Johnson) demolished
their competition by a country mile
while the women’s squad took two
