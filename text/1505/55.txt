What is fives? Read on to the very end,
and you could get involved and start
your beautiful career.
Imperial College Fives society kicked
off a promising start to the season af-
ter representing at the Universities Eton
Fives Championships at Eton College
on 12th November and in the BUCS
Rugby Fives Championships at Marl-
borough College.
In fives, a ball is propelled against the
walls of a special court using gloved or
bare hands as though they were a rac-
quet. Basically, you could say it was
squash’s naughty ambidextrous steps-
ibling.
Rugby fives is very much that, a fast
and furious game played with hands
and can be played in doubles or singles.
Eton Fives is a solely doubles game,
and was modelled on the walls of Eton
Chapel, and involves playing in a 3
walled court with a buttress on the left,
and many ledges to render the game
fast, furious and very unpredictable!
So, first off, with the Eton Fives
Championships, this year, as we had so
many players, we are able to represent
prestigious institution and form an au-
tonomous Imperial College team. There
Fives: much more than
just a prime number
was blood, sweat and many a tear shed
for University bragging rights as we
took down 5 players, 3 of whom, in the
form of Christopher Clarke, Mitul Pa-
lan and George Shillam were complete
fresh faces to the Universities tourna-
ment circuit. Their progressive game-
play was very impressive, which meant
they were truly ambidextrous by the end
of the day, and striking hard cross court
shots any professional would be proud
of.
Our first pair, Abhishek Bhattacha-
rya and Alun Meredith battled hard af-
ter missing out on the group stages to
beat Manchester and Exeter and prog-
ress into the Plate Finals, where they
persevered but had to settle for runner-
up against a strong Queen Mary’s pair,
sadly losing 15-8.
The BUCS Rugby Fives Champion-
ships a fortnight later saw 3 players in
the form of Michael Squire, Abhishek
Bhattacharya and our resident expert
Christopher Burrows (currently rated
13th nationally) locking horns against
the other Universities, representing in
both the singles and doubles tourna-
ments.
They all fought with a determined at-
titude with Michael and Abhishek, first
timers on the BUCS circuit, unable to
pass through the group stages, but suc-
cessfully staying determined enough to
progress into the quarter-finals of the
plate.
Christopher in his own inimitable
style eased into the semi-finals, taking
no mercy on his opponents, crushing
Cambridge, Oxford and Durham, but
encountered difficult opposition in the
semi-finals against a Loughborough
player, who went on to take the title.
Michael and Christopher also rep-
resented the doubles tournament, and
played impressively to reach the Plate
quarters! In all, Imperial reached an
impressive 5th place out of 10.

So that’s what they’re using the decommissioned nuclear bunkers for
Merry Christmas from
the Felix Sport editors!
We hope you’ve enjoyed the
pages of Felix Sport this term,
from the interviews to the match
reports to the not-always-accurate
league table (we do our best!) Next
term, more interviews are planned
as well as possibly the odd com-
Abhishek Bhattacharya
petition or two, so keep reading!
We were told to inject some Christ-
mas cheer into the section but
thought that photoshopping red
hats and snowflaxes into every
picture would be a bit heavy-hand-
ed (so we just did it on the back
page). Anyway, don’t completely
forget to train over the holidays,
so you can come back to London
in January and WIN! Cheers!
