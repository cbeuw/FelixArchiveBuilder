The contents of Hangman’s fridge
DRUNKEN MATES
OF THE WEEK
He must’ve felt a bit dirty after hitting on that Oompa-Lumpa at 568
and needed a shower. He forgot the undressing part, though
These two have both had trouble finding a girlfriend, so they decided
to help each other out. Any hole’s a goal, right?
OH MY GOD EVERYTHING IS EXPIRED
6-pint carton of milk
You were mildly drunk shopping in
Sainsbury’s one night and set about
finding one with the earliest expiry
date, giving yourself the challenge
of finishing it before it goes bad. You
could do as the Mongolians and make
some sort of moonshine out of it, but
you end up turning it into cheese in-
stead. You cut the container open, let
the congealed mass slide out onto the
floor and shrug.
Loaf of bread (six months old)
Everyone in the house assumed it
was someone else’s, so it sits there
unloved, untouched, unused. Rather
like your penis. When this anomaly
finally comes to your attention you
open it, only to be showered in mold
spores. Your loaf of bread looks like
a giant blue Lego, except no toddler
or sane human being is putting it in
its mouth any time soon. Much like
your penis.
Several bottles of beer
The only things in the fridge that can
be counted on not to send alarm bells
ringing at the Centre for Disease Con-
tol, and that’s only because the micro-
organisms already in it were like “fuck
this” and died from alcohol poisoning.
While chugging the bottle you con-
template how great life as a yeast is,
provided it’s inside a barrel and not the
type between some skank’s legs. Wait,
both are actually pluses, damn yeast.
Mousetrap
The rodent problem in your house
is so bad that the buggers have suc-
ceeded in gnawing through the back.
On the upside, at least now you can
eat your housemates’ leftovers with-
out retribution since you can blame
the mice. Mice with huge teeth and
jaws, you tell them. Blaming them
on the “droppings” you leave in
there is a whole different kettle of
fish, though – just use the toilet.
You have no idea how big our problem is. They exhausted the beer
so they moved on to the harder stuff
You wanted snow? Look, there’s snow. Merry fucking Christmas. This
image now contains something our Editor wants. Food. We starve him
to keep him delirious enough to allow some leeway with Hangman
Merry Christmas from
Hangman. Now, start revis-
ing for your exams you shit-
bags. Oh, and no, he/she
next to you doesn’t want
to hear your ‘witty remark’
about their work. I don’t
care that you’ve been per-
fecting the wording for the
last hour and coming up
with follow up conversa-
tion. You are not ‘in there’.
You weren’t going to say
hi anyway. I know that you
said “When the time on
the clock is half past that’s
my deadline to open” but
we both know the truth.
Back to library toilet mas-
turbation for you then.
On the twelfth
day of Christ-
mas my tutor
gave to me...
Don’t forget to catch
your friends making dicks
out of themselves on
New Year’s Eve. Then get
permission and send the
evidence in for a Drunken
Mate of the Week to:
