A taste of Christmas
Five things to know about red and
white wines
1. There is one familiar rule which simply says
that “Red with meat, white with fish”. Is it cor-
rect though? In most cases, a red wine is more
suitable for a meat-based dish, simply because
the tannins (particular ingredients of red wine)
bind the proteins of meat, resulting in a harmonic
matching. Moreover, white wine and seafood have
many things in common, like their flavour ‘inten-
sity’ and texture.
2. Do you know a rule without any exceptions?
Of course not. This is also the case for the previ-
ous point, where exceptions arise because of the
uniqueness of each particular recipe. For example,
imagine a meal with chicken in a white sauce with
mushrooms. We can combine it with a mature
white wine without feeling guilty, as the flavour
and texture of meat will allow for it now. Surely,
though, it is a matter of taste what you will choose
in these cases.
3. Wine is extremely sensitive to temperature
variations. For this reason it is crucial to store
our wines in a place where the temperature is as
stable as possible.
4. You should never put wine in the freezer, for the
reason explained in the previous point. It’s better
to put it in the bin straight away.
5. Finally, our shelves should allow the horizontal
placement of the bottles. The reason is simple;
when the bottles are horizontal the cork is washed
from the wine and remains moist and elastic,
maintaining the ability to adjust well on the neck
of the bottle. Therefore, the wine is protected from
oxygen.

Wine Culture
Michael Krestas makes his top festive food and drink decisions
A luxurious hotel must always include
king size bedrooms, royal breakfast, at
least one swimming pool, a spa, a gym, a
posh bar or... just the greatest chocolate
in the UK! I’m talking about
Hotel Chocolat, the cocoa
grower and chocolatier ev-
ery choco-lover must have
visited at least
once.
At Hotel Choco-
lat you will find
any kind of choco-
late you can imag-
ine; from milk, dark
and white chocolate bars for the
traditionally minded, to chocolate
fondue and champagne truf-
fles for the more adventur-
ous. Whether you’re look-
ing for a Christmas
gift or a
treat to sweeten
your tooth, this is
the place to visit.
Many may argue
chocolate here is
a bit pricey, and
it’s true, but – be-
lieve me – you are
getting the highest qual-
ity in the market. Milk
chocolate cups
filled with layers
of praline and
salted caramel.
Irresistibly cute
Christmas Crackers, with
s p a c e to write your guests’ names
and with a gorgeous filled chocolate hid-
ing inside – perfect as table settings or
as smart tree decorations.

Hotel Chocolat is the hotel of your Christmas dreams
Warm up your winter with Starbucks
The last few days, the temperature has
been falling dramatically, making me think
that my flight back to beautiful Greece
near the end of December may be can-
celled like last year. There’s not much
to do but wear more clothes, buy more
tissues and stay in the warm labs the
most you can. If all of this has proven in
vain, grab one of the Starbucks family of
Red Cup hot drinks. Especially designed
for the Christmas season – when people
tend to spend more money – the Toffee
Nut Latte, Eggnog Latte, Gingerbread
Latte and the Mocha Praline are just what
you need to celebrate the festivities; if
what you need to celebrate Christmas is
a non-reusable paper cup.
Customer alert: Starbucks’ fancy drinks,
as any other’s major coffee shop, con-
sist of a shot of mediocre espresso,
plenty of milk, a few milligrams of the
syrup they get their name from and
whipped cream on top. So keep in mind:
these are not coffee drinks – not even
latte – although I must admit they are
very enjoyable during the cold days.

A classic winter warmer combining
blackcurrants, aronia berries, and
spice, this cordial is best mixed with
hot water although warm red wine is
the choice to go with to capture the
full essence of Christmas.
When the cold days are over,
if you have some cordial left
try mixing it with sparkling wa-
ter; it’s just as refreshing as a
soda and very tasty.
Available also in these fla-
vours: Pomegranate & Elder-
flower, Sparkling Ginger &
Lemongrass Presse, Lem-
ongrass with Ginger Cordial,
and many more.

rum nuts, orange, and spices. A “dif-
ferent” choice for those seeking an in-

bread, chocolate
orange, and cin-
namon are

of the
