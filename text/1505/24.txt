I hate Christmas
I
t’s about that time of year
again. Bloody Christmas time.
You’re probably reading this
right now with the most ap-
palled look on your face. I sug-
gest you remove it before someone
notices. ‘But why? Why do you hate
Christmas?’ You must be asking. Well
let me tell you. Because its frickin’ ir-
ritating. Irritating as hell.
Where do I even start? Well let’s
begin with the obvious: Christmas
isn’t even real. What is Christmas
exactly? It’s a celebration of Jesus’
birthday, the Son of God and our
saviour (as people believe). Here’s a
news flash for you: Jesus wasn’t born
on December the 25th. He was actu-
ally born somewhere in the spring-
time. The day everyone is really cel-
ebrating is actually a Pagan holiday
that Christians chose to replace with
Christmas, as it was easier to choose a
day that everyone already celebrated
when Christianity was just starting.
Weirdest thing? Loads of Christians
already know this! They accept that
Jesus wasn’t actually born in winter
but say it’s still a good reason to cel-
ebrate God or something. This defeats
the original purpose about Jesus be-
ing born or whatever… but okay. So
Christmas isn’t actually Christmas,
it’s Pagan-mas. But I guess that’s not
as catchy.
And so what if Jesus wasn’t born
on Christmas? Most people who cele-
brate Christmas nowadays don’t even
believe in Jesus. It’s a known fact that
Church attendance is falling every
year. How many people go to Church
on Christmas anymore? I don’t re-
ally care. And neither do you, because
more likely than not, you probably
don’t go to Church on Christmas. So
if you aren’t celebrating God or Jesus
or anything else of a religious nature
then what are you celebrating? Oh
that’s right, consumerism! The most
celebrated part of Christmas is pres-
ents. We’d like to think of ourselves as
deep and moral people, but the truth is
that we bloody love stuff. Christmas
promotes materialism. Children come
running down the stairs on Christmas
morning to open presents and stock-
ings. I mean, what would Christmas
be without presents? Face it; it’d be
really boring. What else would have
you running down those stairs? A tree?
Let’s not go into how environmentally
unfriendly Christmas is in regards to
trees – that’s obvious enough.
Dare I even mention ‘Christmas
cheer’? Yes, because it’s insanely in-
furiating. Everyone gets ‘merry’ and
‘joyful’ around Christmas, simply be-
cause it’s Christmas time. Seriously?
It’s just a time of the year. I’m not
going to get randomly cheery just be-
cause it’s a Tuesday afternoon or be-
cause Jupiter has aligned with Mars.
When someone smiles and wishes me
a Merry Christmas it feels so fake I
practically want to slap the smile
off their face. Also, don’t start look-
ing forward to Christmas in October.
What is that about? You’ve got two
months! At least allow Halloween to
pass. But that’s not even the worse
part. It’s the stupid ‘post-Christmas
depression’ that everyone goes into
once Christmas is over. What the hell
is wrong with you? It’s just one day
of the year! I don’t get depressed after
my birthday (apart from when I cry
over how old I’m getting). It’s under-
standable if you feel a bit down after
summer but that’s because university/
work is starting. But you shouldn’t get
depressed because Christmas is over;
there’s nothing you can do about it.
Get over it and get on with your life
please. Thanks.
Christmas songs. I want to rip more
than just my hair out when I hear one,
I want to rip my whole frickin’ skull
out. If that isn’t false cheer I don’t
know what is. Throw in some stupid
shallow competition for the ‘Christ-
mas No. 1’ and have 20 different
songs released in the same week about
mistletoe and shit and I’m just about
ready to smash my radio in. Christ-
mas loses a lot of sentimental mean-
ing and value when you have so many
cheesy songs about it. It’s a quick way
for celebrities to make a lot of money.
In fact, Christmas in itself is one big
money making machine. Card compa-
nies must love it. And obviously with
the aforementioned present buying,
retailers must be raking it in. Also,
what is with shops being open on
Christmas nowadays? Who on earth is
going to go to McDonald’s on Christ-
mas day? A very lonely person, that’s
who.
But I’m not going to deny that
Christmas does have some good
points. I mean the lights are beauti-
ful and they make people happy. I can
agree that Christmas dinner is special
and damn well delicious (I bet the
poor turkeys wouldn’t agree though).
And the Christmas drinks they do at
Starbucks are awesome (especially the
Eggnog Latte). The main point is that
Christmas is a good way to bring fam-
ily together. There are very few times
in the year when all the family get
together and just well… spend time
together. The fact that you need one
day in a year to bring all the family to-
gether is a different problem in itself,
but at least it can be counted as Christ-
mas’ redeeming quality. It makes it
very depressing for those who spend
Christmas alone, but for those of you
that are lucky enough to spend it with
family: good for you. Just remember
that it isn’t always about the presents,
cards, trees or decorations. So if you
don’t get the present you wanted this
Christmas, or your tree isn’t as big as
you wanted it to be, then just take a
moment to shut the fuck up and stop
complaining. Christmas is primarily
meant to be about all that sentimental
stuff (or the religious stuff if you’re
religious). Having said that, Christ-
mas still annoys the shit out of me.
Or maybe I just hate the way society
perceives Christmas. Or maybe I just
hate society. Who knows?
He hates Christmas, I hate writing witty captions to please the masses

Danny Wallace is the King of
light humour, if you ask me.
The books are split into sep-
arate little stories; many of
them will make you laugh out
loud. They are both a thor-
oughly enjoyable read and are
a perfect example of writing a
fun, irreverent column that is
very readable. Put it in Felix
and it would be the perfect
way to cheer someone up on a
dreary Friday morning.
With the January exams com-
ing up (sorry for reminding you
about them), you don’t exactly
want to be reading War and
Peace do you now?

Some people may think that
Charlie Brooker has gone ‘com-
ercial’ and ‘sold out’ recently.
However, his earlier work, col-
lected here in this book, is a
perfect example of how to
write a comment article that is
funny and gets his point across
effectively. Usually, he has a
serious point that he wants
to make. He ensures that it is
humorous (or sweary) enough
to make you want to read all
the way to the end. He also
tends to use well reasoned ar-
guments that don’t hinge on a
pre-decided viewpoint that he
just wants to justify.
