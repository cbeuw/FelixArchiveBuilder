FELIX Friday 09 DECEMBER 2011 49
Horoscopes*
Scorpio
This week your flatmates are decorating
the Christmas tree in the living room. You
don’t help, but instead play Deus Ex. You
come downstairs 4 hours later to find that
the mixture of mulled wine and tinsel
made the whole affair descend into a mass-
festive-sex-orgy. You hate it when you
miss your flatmates sex orgies.
Aries
This week you are at a Christmas party
when Mariah Carey’s ‘All I want for
Christmas is you’ comes on. This is to-
tally your song. You go mental and start
throwing shapes on the floor while sing-
ing at the top of your voice. Could be
worse, you could be writing about how
amazing your phone is in a newspaper.
Taurus
This week you go ice skating at the
Natural History museum Ice Rink. Tired
of being out-done by the flocks of irri-
tatingly talented 5 year olds, you try to
show off by skating backwards and do-
ing a spin. You wake up 4 hours later in
Chelsea and Westminster hospital with
an IQ of 52. You become a politician.
Gemini
This week you are at a Christmas party
when a ‘girl’ starts going mental to Mari-
ah Carey’s ‘All I want for Christmas is
you’, she knocks your bottle of Peroni
from your hand with one of her ‘dance
moves’. You decide there and then that
you hate Christmas and decide to do
something about it. It is going to massive.
.
Cancer
This week it’s intensely cold. Like seri-
ously really cold. As your aching bones
protest when you try and get out of your
sleeping bag, you realise occupy LSX is a
complete waste of time, pack up your stuff,
go home and become a normal, function-
ing member of society. Was that so hard?
You chuckle about hard meaning erect.
Leo
This week you are Mariah Carey. As
with every week in December for the
last 17 years, a massive royalties cheque
lands on your door mat. Just when you
start thinking what you’re going to do
with the money, you notice an enraged
geek shuffling up your driveway holding
what looks like a Bunsen burner. You
scream for 1 minute, ranging 3 octaves.
Virgo
This week your parents ring you up
and ask what you want for Christmas.
“Damnit guys you know I became
a Wicca New Age Vampire when I
came to uni” you shout down the line
and hang up. On December 25th your
mum hands you a Christmas card with
“You were always a disappointment”
scrawled on Baby Jesus’s face.
Libra
This week you find yourself still hun-
gover from last night’s Christmas party
and jet lagged from your flight to LA,
stood in Mariah Carey’s front room with
her lifeless body in front of you and a
blood splattered Bunsen burner in hand.
This could yet turn out to be the best
Christmas ever.
Sagittarius
This week you’re Noddy Holder, sat inside
your reinforced concrete panic room. You
can’t be too careful with the Christmas
Number1serialkiller,knownintabloidsas
“The Grinch” still on the prowl. You hear
a rattling in your air duct. No. He’s found
you! You, like everyone else, had hoped
that he’d only go for X-Factor winners.
Capricorn
This week you wonder why a leading
institute full of people who spend their
entire lives being analytical get excited
about a day commemorating the intense
labour pains of a woman that got knocked
up by an imaginary bird-man working for
an invisible being. Pushing the thoughts to
one side, you tuck into a Lindt Reindeer.
Aquarius
This week you burst out of the air
vent into Noddy Holder’s panic room,
screaming “IT’S CHRIIIISTMAAASSS
MOTHERFUCKER!” you pick up the
nearestplatformshoeandbringitsmashing
down onto his head. “Bah, Humbug” you
mutter, crossing the last name off your list.
Pisces
This week you are still the brunette in the
yellow jumper with gold studded black
gloves smoking in the entrance to Sher-
field last Wednesday, you still haven’t
called. 07515789751, don’t keep me
waiting baby. I’ve got something big in
my stocking for you… (it’s my penis).

Christmas pudding (n.)
1. Santa’s way of tricking you into eat-
ing fruit during the holiday season, in
between all the meat and booze.
2. A sweet dessert that defies all logic
by improving in flavour the longer it’s
kept in the cupboard. A lazy student’s
dream.
3. “Giving her a Christmas pudding”
– taking a beer shit on your partner’s
chest after sex while wearing a Santa
hat. If you’ve been naughty in the
bedroom it’s what you’ll get for Christ-
mas. Bonus points if delivered down a
chimney.
Christmas (n.)
1. The day Christians gather round to
completely disregard Jesus’s sacrifices
for mankind by eating food that’d keep
Sub-Saharan Africans going for weeks.
2. The day atheists also disregard Jesus
Christ’s sacrifices, just like any other
day of the year.
3. The day spoilt single children of
wealthy parents throw a tantrum be-
cause they got a silver-plated PS3 when
they explicitly asked for gold. Fuck off
and die.
Eggnog (n.)
1. An unholy matrimony of eggs,
sugar, milk and some sort of alcoholic
beverage. It’s a drink that thinks it’s a
cake.
2. WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL ME?
Oh, right, yes I’ll have a refill if you’re
offering.
3. A drink that’s as overflowing with
calories as it is with the letter g. Like
my semenggggggggggggggggggggg.
Mistletoe (n.)
1. The most effective way of messing
with Imperialites over Christmas. The
odds of two men standing underneath
it are alarmingly high.
2. The street name for rohypnol.

Turns out their blowholes aren’t
meant for THAT. Come on, why
are they that shape? Screw PETA
I
n an attempt to become more
environmentally aware, ca-
tering at the Library Café has
moved towards serving food
that has less impact on the envi-
ronment, including dolphin curry once
a week, starting from next month.
What makes the controversial menu
option green is that it comes from fish-
eries that make sure they only catch
dolphins, either returning other spe-
cies into the water or using special
nets that let smaller species through,
like tuna. Tuna bycatches in dolphin
fishing have been the cause of a great
deal of protest by Greenpeace, and
also PETA, an activist of which was
the turnip
Little girls across world horrified
tracked down for an interview and
asked why the animal rights group
appeared to have no problem with the
dolphin catch.
“Dolphins are clever enough to fend
for themselves, fuck them. Tuna, on
the other hand, are rather defenceless.
Did you know that tuna are warm-
blooded? We’re warm-blooded as
well. They don’t deserve this treat-
ment. I’m glad fishermen have begun
adopting tuna-friendly catching meth-
ods.” The interview ended abruptly
when the beef burgers were brought
in. The representative gave no expla-
nation as to why he refused to answer
any further questions.
