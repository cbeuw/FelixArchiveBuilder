SITE C O N S T R U C T I O N South London Gallery
A
s I entered I could not help notic-
ing the broken plasterboard on
thc floor, which I assumed was
connected to thc theme of Site Con-
struction. After falling through slabs of
plaster up lo my ankles, I was thinking
less about thc issue behind the sup-
posed artwork and more about my dirty
shoes.
Thc artists originated from Berlin and
as the press spiel suggested we would
see some political background to the
artwork, however the latent political
meaning was probably exactly that.
Thc luwies I spoke to had difficulty
themselves in determining thc ideas
behind the work. But with pieces that
could be best described as shaped hunks
of chipboard nailed together, I under-
stand their turmoil. After attending I
learnt about the finer points of installa-
tion, in essence it means taking objects
and showing them in a place in which
people view art, in this case a gallery. The
exhibition included many tele-visual dis-
plays depicting
everything
from cycle
engines being
dismantled to
cargo ships.
Perhaps
one of thc
most provoca-
tive pieces
was a looped
video of a
naked middle-
aged woman with a metal box in the
design of a house over her head, which
was subsequently banged against the
wall (Hausfrau swinging, pictured). Pre-
sumably, the artist was trying to provoke
domesticity issues (I had to ask), however
my first response was: how much did
they reimburse the woman for losing so
many of her neurons?
After some
time staring at
the video of the
cargo ship,
which simply
ploughed
thtough thc
ocean, I gave
up on the ques-
tions of why
and started on
the question of
_ how someone
can call this artistic and moreover what
am I doing here looking it! Had I found
an antenna, I would have tuned into
Eldorado repeats if they were showing.
The highlight of the evening was a
quick rendition of someone German
yelling words, seemingly at random, to
the delight of the audience. Much to the
aggravation of my inner ear, the yelling
was interspersed with a two-tone per-
formance on a tin whistle.
Many moons ago, a lecturer
explained that mathematics is very beau-
tiful. At the time, I and the rest of the
tutorial thought he was rather mad. But
now I realise that I too would rather look
at a board full of equations than a picture
of turf. Admittedly I was sceptical of mod-
ern art before, but this exhibition has
done nothing but re-affirm my beliefs.

ECSTASY Arts Theatre
O
n the face of it, the plot of this
play is not inspiring. Set in a Kil-
burn bed-sit in 1979, it is a
glimpse into the life of Jean - a singularly
moody individual, with a bit of a drink
problem, who is trying to sort out her life.
Act one details her problematic and love-
less relationship with her boyfriend Roy.
Act two consists entirely of a drunken
evening involving Jean, her friend Dawn,
Dawn's husband Mick and their old mate
Len.
Do not be fooled by this. The show
presented by About Face Productions is
a hilarious, touching, brilliantly acted and
well directed West-End debut by a new
company, which thoroughly deserved
the standing ovation that it got on the
Press Night.
Mike Leigh (of Secrets and Lies
fame) has, in Ecstasy, produced a script
which is an acutely observed, but also
painfully accurate portrayal of real life. It
has to be one of thc most 'real' depic-
tions of life that I have seen for a long
time, underlining the banality of modern
existence, particularly in the language
which is full of platitudes and cliches.
It is also a play which, although writ-
ten and set in 1979, has dated surpris-
ingly little, largely because it deals very
much with human nature rather than
topical issues. Thc set and costumes are
exactly right for the period, but the emo-
tions and sentiments expressed in the
play are still extremely relevant today.
The cast made the most of the mate-
rial, squeezing every last drop of humour
and meaning out of thc script with fan-
tastically realistic acting from everyone.
I was particularly impressed with the
drunk scene, which is the best I've ever
witnessed (on the stage at any rate).
Watching Mick stumbling round the
stage, I felt as though I was watching it
from the inside. I could remember, rather
too clearly, those moments when I too
have been in a similar state (though that
may have had something to do with the
couple of drinks at the interval). I just sat
there thinking 'Yeah, it really is like that.
That's brilliant!' It was amazing to watch
the company construct an intriguing and
funny show out of a script which, if
poorly done, could have left thc audi-
ence bored to tears, or laughing at, rathet
than with, thc cast.
The show is comedic, poignant, and
magnificently staged study of the mun-
dane that I heartily recommend to every-
one.

TESS O F T H E D'URBERVILLES New End Theatre
H
ardship, hope, affection, tragedy,
love, loss, marriage, murder, love
again and then death. Tess has
all of the emotions and just when you
think everything will get back on track...
well life simply gets worse
If you haven't read the book, here's
a quick outline of thc plot: Tess is a
young country girl from Marlott driven by
poverty into what she believes is her
wealthy relations' home. She is abused
by her 'cousin' and is forced to leave and
work on a dairy farm. There she and a
man named Angel Clare fall in love and
marry. On their wedding night she con-
fesses her 'sin' with hot cousin, so he
leaves her and goes to Brazil. Thinking
him dead, she marries her reformed
cousin, but Angel reappears. She is so
overjoyed to see him that she kills her
new husband and she is hanged fot hot
crime.
Classic Thomas Hardy, then. But this
production has a musical side. Yes, we
were sceptical too, but don't get the
wrong idea. The music, by Anthony Feld-
man, is appropriate and does not detract
from the story or dialogue. The well
placed, unaccompa-
nied songs, all in the
style of the period,
not only smooth
over the scene
changes but also
complement the
story and events,
portrayed so cleverly
by all the actors any-
way.
Celia Hcncbury
as Tess is good at
pulling the most
miserable and tragic
faces imaginable,
and her skill at play-
ing the part is
equally impressive. T
without exception and whilst sparse the
scenery was extremely dynamic. Four
blocks were used as a grain crusher,
horse and carriage, milk parlour and
beds. Although they managed to be con-
vincing, it was perhaps slightly hard to fol-
low if you aren't
amiliar with the
stoty. What could
also be confusing
was that the seven
actors in the com-
pany had to play all
of the characters of
MBi Ihe novel. I laving
said this, both kept
your attention and
made for a com-
pelling three hours.
Difficult scenes
were portrayed with
sensitivity - the rape
scene was very tact-
fully done. How-
ever, perhaps not enough attention was
paid to Tcss1
death in the end. Admit-
tedly, Michael try's adaptation is faithful
to the book, but for the theatre, wc felt
almost robbed of an opportunity to really
bawl our eyes out.
Considering that The Classic Reaction
Theatre Company was only founded in
1996, it showed remarkable organisa-
tion and expertise in pulling off a won-
derful production. Their ability to spot
young, emerging talent seemed to bring
the actors together as a real team. They
worked so well that we came out of thc
theatre thoroughly depressed and very
introspective. In fact, wc were almost
ready to end it all until we spotted Dale
Winton at Hampstead McDonalds in his
leather trousers which cheered us up
no end!
