Right Angles To Reality
Millennium
Y
ou can tell that it's getting close to
thc end of the century. Thc date is
a real give away for a start. But leav-
ing aside rigorous science, there are
other signs that point to the arrival of this
temporal milestone. In days gone by
people used to look for indications of
what thc future held in the entrails of
dead animals or the pattern of cracks that
formed on heating a tortoise's shell over
an open fire, which sounds bizarre but
which in truth is no worse than watching
Russell Grant and probably considerably
more entertaining.
Such a preoccupation with sooth-
saying didn't end with the divination of
the ancients. Recently it has become
almost impossible to turn on the telly or
open a newspaper without coming
across a 'what does the new millennium
hold for you' - type feature. In the 1950s
and 60s, such articles were a thing of
splendour - by the year 2000, manned
bases would have been built on Mars,
whole tracts of the Sahara would have
been reclaimed and turned into the gar-
den of bden, and disease and misery
would have been eradicated from the
face of the tarth. Admittedly, we made
it to the moon by the year of my birth,
and I learn from my old friend and spar-
ring partner Simon Baker (aka The Voice
of Reason) that about fifteen hundred
square feet of the carpark outside of
Waterstone's is being turned into a cab-
bage patch for the
good of Betty Wind-
sor and the benefit
of mankind in gen-
eral, but other than
that we've all fallen
rather short of the
somewhat heady
aspirations of the
Rock and Roll gener-
ation. So much so
that some months ago a well-known
'adult' comic reported that the official
'Year of the Future' has been put back to
2020 and that flying cars, robot maids
and hand-held shrinking ray machines
are now expected to be phased in from
2035.
It'll be interesting to see how cloth-
ing manufacturers react to the new mil-
lennium. Opinion is divided on the
subject of what the man/woman/impas-
sive-faccd android about town will be
wearing in the year 2000. If costume
designers for futuristic sci-fi movies from
1950 onwards are to be believed, we'll
have two choices. Option one will resem-
ble a cross between Tudor-style court

rations of the Rock
and Roll generation...
costume and police-issue
body armour, a sort of Car-
dinal Wolscy meets the NYPD SWAT
team, complete with flowing capes, soft
felt hats and Kevlar exoskeleton - laser-
guided codpieces for the men, bullet-
proof boob tubes for the women.
Alternatively we'll all be walking around
in androgynous one-size-fits-all body
stockings, possibly with black plastic util-
ity belts and badges-indicating the IVF fer-
mentation broth from which we
originated, affixed to our nipples. There
will be no fat people as this would cause
unsightly bulges.
For the same rea-
son, the male sex-
ual response will
have to be bred out
of the species. What
comes as a mild sur-
prise to me is that
nobody seems to
have considered
the possibility that
we'll continue to
wear jeans and a T-
shirt in the next millennium or that M&S
will still be knocking out hideous Fairlsle
cable-knit sweaters to go with their own-
brand Chinos and canvas deck shoes. If
you doubt me, try to name a single sci-
fi film in which the characters look like
anything other than the survivors of the
Battle of Bosworth Field or cast-offs from
a Jane Fonda 'Shake
Up and Dance' fit-
ness video.
Having spent a
small fortune in the
January sales this year
(although not on
cable-knit sweaters I
can assure you), the
news that I'll have to
have a complete
change of wardrobe in about 14 months
has come as a rather unwelcome sur-
prise, although Oxfam are going to have
a field day. However, I doubt that I'm
alone in being perturbed by this impend-
ing radical shake-up in sartorial behav-
iour.
The loss of traditional fashion lines
will mean that high street retailers will be
hard pushed to retain their distinctive
brand images, particularly if the unisex
body stocking option, gets thc nod. I
foresee major job losses in thc budget
retailing sector in this event, although
eradicating the male sexual response
seems a small price to pay for getting
shot of Cromwell's Madhouse and Mr
'...nobody seems to
have considered the
possibility that we'll

and a T-shirt in the next
millennium...'
Byrite. Personally I'm hop-
ing that the Tudor noble-
man-cum-Noo Yoike cop look wins
through, as I don't think I could get away
with a stretch Lycra catsuit and I've always
harboured a secret longing for tights
and a feathered calfskin cap (this is just
between thc two of us you understand).
But as well as looking forward, the
turn of the century has traditionally been
a time to look back and prepare an end-
of-era report on the previous hundred
years. The recent profusion of 'Top 100...'
type listings in the seemingly boundless
glossy magazine
market serves to
confirm that the
trend is still alive
and well. Maybe it's
just me, but for a
century that started
with thc Boer War,
moved smartly
through World War I
and II, took 5 years
off before starting
on Korea, then with-
out so much as a pause for breath,
marched on to Vietnam for a 10-year
stop-over whilst simultaneously spawning
bloody conflagrations in the Middle East,
Central America, Afghanistan and thc
Falklands before returning to Lurope,
the home of warfare, for a local derby in
Yugoslavia (refereed inexpertly by the
UN) which has already
gone into overtime and
may yet have to be
decided on penalties;
nominations for 'Best
War 1900-2000' have
been remarkably thin on
the ground.
Whilst 'Best War' is
by far thc most coveted
award, there are dozens
of others up for grabs: 'Best Civil War',
'Best Regional Skirmish', 'Best Supporting
Army', 'Best Directed Battle', 'Best Popular
Insurrection', 'Best Use of Pathogenic
Defoliant in a Jungle Campaign', 'Most
Flagrant Violation of the Geneva Con-
vention', 'Most Inhumane Use of Lethal
Force as an Organ of National Foreign
Policy' - thc list is endless. Competition
for the much sought-after prize for 'Most
Murderous Dictator' is expected to be
especially fierce, with Hitler, Stalin and Pol
Pot amongst the favourites at this stage.
The closely related award for 'Ruthless
Dictator Most Resembling a 1940s Scat
Singer' is likely to go to former Chilean
tyrant General Pinochet for his startlingly
realistic impression of Cab Calloway. It is
rumoured that the General is even now
believed to be considering calling Min-
nie the Moocher as a character witness
in his forthcoming extradition hearings.
As always, the identity of the winner of
thc prestigious 'Kim Philby Award for
Espionage and High Treason' is, for obvi-
ous reasons, a closely guarded secret.
About the only thing known for sure is
that the successful nominee will not be
present to collect their prize in person.
As expected, the 'Lifetime Award for
Bringing the World to the Brink of
Armageddon' looks like being a straight
fight between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact. The only bright spot is the cancel-
lation of the award fot 'Most! hinly Veiled
Advancement of the Cold War in the
Guise of International Peacekeeping'
(past recipients of which include the CIA,
MI5 and thc KGB), due to lack of inter-
est.
I'm not being flippant. Out lives,
those of our parents and our parents'
parents can be charted by what all-star
cast was packing them in at which The-
atre of War at the time. Understandably
however, we prefer to overlook this
rather unsavoury aspect of the 20th Cen-
tury and compile lists of positive things
that have happened within living mem-
ory. Most interesting of the genre for me
was a Best 1000 Pop and Rock Albums of
All Time book put out recently by a pub-
lishing house run by a
latter day Phileas Fogg.
I was delighted to find
that of the top 5 albums
-which is as far as I got
before being chased
out of Dillons by an
irate shop assistant - a
fab four of them were
by the Beatles. To my
great satisfaction (but
not to that of the Rolling Stones - they
were well down the list), my personal all
time favourite album Revolver was no 1
with Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band and The Beatles (aka The
White Album) coming in at nos 2 and 3.
The fads from Liverpool also captured
fifth place with Abbey Road. Inexplicably,
the no 4 spot went to the album Never-
mind.
Considering all thc great albums
released since Nipper heard His Mas-
ter's Voice, this strikes me as a surprising
choice, but at least it irrevocably clears up
one thing - it was Nirvana that split the
Beatles. Yoko Ono can finally stand
absolved.
