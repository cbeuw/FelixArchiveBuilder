ey again, Kristin, you up for a
spin? This is hard to write. I real-
ly want to like this record but
it's not easy. You mean a lot. Through
the frantic and at times relentless mania
of Throwin' Muses, the output shone
with staggeringly accurate insight and
observation. Your first solo effort. Hips
and Makers resonates with an unerring
beauty that probably only hints at the
demons that haunt your soul. This
year's Strange Angel is similarly sparse -
the fusion of a disturbing, yet engag-
ing, vocal delivery with acoustic atmos-
pherics.
It's not that I dislike folk music. I
was there at the front of the Free Trade
Flail back in '66 hollering 'Judas!' berat-
ing his higness Zimmerman for selling
out to the Man. But Appalachian folk
songs, Kristin? For crying out loud! I
mean, I know Neil Young sang, 'Old
times were good times' and these mur-
der and drinking ballads may remind
you of childhood - a time before the
pain, a time before you looked into the
abyss and, well, fell right in, to the very
bottom. Or have I Just got the wrong end
of the stick? Is this an exorcism that I'm
listening to or are you confronting the
ghosts of the past that have haunted you
ever since?
Whatever the case may be, it's not
easy to stomach. Down in the Willow
Garden, Banks of the Ohio and Whole
I leap of Little Horses work, the latter
seemingly being reinterpreted as a
touching communication to your kids
and Banks.... telling atale of spumed love
evolving into fatal retribution benefits
greatly from your countrified twang of a
vocal and the simple moan of an elec-
tric organ. As for the rest? I'm not sure
how to put this but no matter how many
times I listen, the music just creates the
urge to shout, 'Yee-I lahl' or tunelessly
bellow, 'I'm Popeye the sailor man.' Sorry
Kristin. That just isn't good enough. 0

few years back not even US hip-
hop was much cop. Originality
was lacking and the edge that
had made hip-hop so good in the early
days seemed to have disappeared. Up
then sprung Death Row from the west
coast, a recording label with what
seemed like that little something extra.
I lip-hop heads jumped for joy as they
all praised the likes of Dr. Dre, Tupac
and Snoop Doggy Dogg. It seemed that
a new force was born, and Kurupt was
among them.
Sadly, with hindsight, the Death Row
output wasn't actually very good. Apart
from Warren G's chart classic Regulate
and Snoop's first album Doggystyle, most
of what was produced can only be
described as good for hip-hops few years
in the cold. Thankfully Wu Tang et al
finally brought us out of this rut and
Death Row and the majority of its artists
fell by the wayside. But here we are, five
years on and Snoop and Kurupt have
both brought out new albums. It would
have probably been best for all con-
cerned if Snoop had been found guilty
of accessory to murder and his musical
output had been halted after Doggystyle.
But he has carried on in one way or
anothet and most of what he's done has-
n't been worth a second listen, the new
album included. Kurupt, however, seems
to have moved on.
Rather than getting bogged down,
or even killed, in all that east coast -
west coast argument rubbish, Kurupt
has managed to avoid the trap that has
caught most Death Row artists and has
produced an album combining flavouts
from both sides of the states. The album
comes in a double CD pack; one for the
east coast and one for the west, and the
sounds on each represent each of the
sounds excellently.
The tunes are pure hip-hop, and
west coaster Kurupt steers well clear of
anything that might be misconstrued as
gangsta rap. Another big plus is that
Kurupt takes the chance to introduce a
number of new stats on the album rather
than relying on the big names to spice
up his poetry.
So Kurupt lives on while others have
faltered and from what we get on Kurup-
tion he'll probably be living it large for
quite some time. Tupac is dead! Snoop
is shit! Kurupt is king! EJ

on You Should Be Dancing. I his is a typ-
ically dark affair which has all the tradi-
tional Peter I look bass-line and bad
vocal combinations. Good stuff, though,
the best track is a toss-up between
Space and their version of 'Mas-
sacheusetts and the Lightning Seeds'
To Love Somebody. Neither song
sounds like the band in question and the
Seeds track is a very bare acoustic gui-
