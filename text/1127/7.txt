Money Money Money
Capitalism has us in its competitive jaw.
I was listening to the BBC World Service
the other night, specifically to a defence
expert suggesting that America may be
tempted to attack Iraq simply because
the military operation has cost $3 billion
so far this year, and not a shot has been
fired. People need to see evidence that
their taxes are well spent.
Economies in Asia are in turmoil,
while so-called 'underdeveloped' nations
are being crippled by the burden of
debts to World Banks.
Meanwhile nearer to home students
are campaigning against tuition fees and
a government whose constant response
is 'we don't have enough money'.
Consultancy firms, banks and invest-
ment companies are enticing Imperial's
finest with offers of high starting salaries
and regular bonuses. A few decades
ago 'naive' idealism would have made us
say "no - I want to stay in science and
make a difference. Sure I'll get paid
less, but if it's enough to get by, I'm
happy." Now it seems all we can see is
pound signs, secure incomes and pen-
sion plans. I'm not saying I would be
happy living off a PhD grant all my life,
but £15k before tax would supply all my
material needs, even living in London.
So why are we increasingly swap-
ping idealism and ambition for pay
cheques? Do we really believe that
'money is the means to happiness'? I
freely admit that I'm better off than most
students,- I've spent much of my life sur-
rounded by wealthy friends, and I can
safely say money causes more problems
than it solves. Just look at the examples
above. Would the abolition of money as
Marx advocated be such a bad thing?
And for those of you applying for jobs
this term, just stop briefly and ask your-
self if you want the job, or the money.
Has anyone got any 1120s?
On a lighter note, I have a request to
make. Would anyone who has a copy of
the first Felix of term (issue 1120) which
they no longer require please drop it into
the office? We seem to have run out of
spare copies, and could do with a few for
the archive. Cheers. Ed
