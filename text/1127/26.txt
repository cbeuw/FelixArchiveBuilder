IC I 65 - 0 UCH
We arrived to find that we had our
favourite ref. that last week disallowed
four tries and he was to persist in this
biased manner.
Hopes were high when we warmed
up and all expected another thrashing
of the sort IC had been dishing out all
term.
The term got off to a poor start and
we were surprised to come up against
a side prepared to run and tackle. The
first half ended 18-0 to IC, the players
only just starting to wake up. The ref.
managed to have his say and overruled
the touch judges to disallow a perfectly
good conversion. In the second half the
tties and the opposition injuries began
to flow.
Good tries from Gol, Hogg and Cun-
nel lifted the pace and UCH centre tried
top distract them by having his finger
snapped in half and impressing all with
his contottionism. More tries came
from Kaisen & Sven, who finsihed thc
day off. Tref scored two tries and was
fantastic.
Cricket
"It's November, why is there Cricket on
the sports page?" you ask. Well, I need
to the fill the space and this seemed as
good a way as any, so here goes:
The Felix 1998/99 Ashes Preview!
When it comes to cricket most peo-
ple agree there is nothing better than an
Ashes contest. The series started at the
Gabba in Brisbane on Friday morning,
and England will be hoping for a large
slice of luck, going up against an incred-
ibly strong Australian side that lacks only
Shane Warne to make it the strongest
possible one.
England expected Mike Atherton to
play in the match, despite a long-term
back injury flaring up. The toss will be
crucial and as the Gabba pitch usually
favours the batsmen, Alec Stewart will be
looking to put the Aussics in first. If that
happens England's bowlers must not
waste the new ball, as they have in the
past. Limiting the Australian totals is
crucial to success throughout the series
and letting them run up huge totals will
just put pressure on an already fragile
England batting line-up, which will
inevitably collapse horribly.
Even without Shane Warne, I cannot
really see England winning the series.
My prediction: 3-1 to Australia. Gus
No Score Given
Under a blood red sky, the stage of
pain was prepared, (oh dear - Gus)
Adrenaline pumping, muscles throb-
bing and veins pulsating the warriors
were ready and eager for battle. The
score was set for IC 2nd's crushing
demolition job. Trys were scored with
random case duting a hectic 1st half,
with good support play, securing a 46-7
lead after 40 minutes. Expectations
were high for a century victory, though
a degree of complacency set in during
the first 20 minutes, until the flood gates
opened and IC II began to show the
form we have all come to know and
love. The final scoreline demonstrated
the continuing form and sexy style of
this crack outfit.
Notable tries by thc elusive Flying Flo
and the mind boggling skills and speed
of the park stud, Oily Conga. Well done
Oily.
Boat Club
Last weekend saw the "Fullers head of
the River Fours" - the first race of the
year for the boatclub.
The sponsor's generosity in offering
free drinks at the brewery for category
winners managed to coax many of the
crews into competing in reputedly one
of the toughest faces of the year. Com-
petition was fictce with over 220 com-
petitors (511 crews) battling out the time
trial-style race on the Thames "reverse
boat-race" course from Mortlake to Put-
ney. Competitots included World and
Olympic champions (including Steve
Redgrave), universities, colleges, schools
and clubs.
Imperial had several crews entered
and all raced well in thc fast tailwind con-
ditions, most boats finishing within the
top 100. We came away with a win in
the competitive scniot coxless fours
(28th overall) and with victory just stolen
from a strong senior two coxed four by
an astoundingly good Oxford boat, now
being investigated by race organisers.
Basketball
The IC Basketball Club could not have
dreamt of a better start of the season in
the Men's BUSA Merit League! Four
matches, four wins and three of them
away, too. Out first match against GKT
proved to be tougher than initially
thought, mainly because we hadn't had
a single practice before it. Yet, even
though every player was given court
time and a great deal of defensive and
offensive experimentation was done,
the final score gave us a comfortable win
by 71-58. UCH seemed to prove a more
competent opponent but when IC put its
full force at play the UCf Medics could
only watch us...
In thc matches against UCL and
King's, however, we showed our real
qualities this year: tight and efficient
defence, as well as ability to retain con-
trol of the game, even when the oppo-
nents seem to get away. In both matches
IC came from behind, 15-25 in thc UCL
Snooker
It was a cold and wet Sunday morning
when the team members of Imperial's
Snooker teams travelled to their first
match of the season - away at
Southampton. The team was a mix of
old and new and there was an excited
atmosphere as they entered thc venue
of last year's BUSA Nationals where they
had put up such a resolute performance.
Thc new look A-team found the going
tough as a close match was eventually
won 17-15 by Southampton. The B-team
were the real success story here with an
inspired 23-9 victory including excellent
efforts by Peter Cheung and David Elliott.
Cross Country
Imperial College travelled to Wimbledon
College for the third race of the London
Colleges League. After negotiating some
dodgy tube timetables we finally arrived
to kick wombles.
IC finally managed to field a
women's team with captain Bethan lead-
ing the team home in second place.
Debutant Vic Farmer powered to 17th
with Zoe Quinn scoring in 25th.
The men's race set off at a rapid
pace with many runners fading badly as
soon as they hit thc hill situated halfway.
ULU captain Ben Hukins led thc
team home in 3rd with Andy Pritchard
5th. IC's first team, benefitting from the
absence of a strong Brunei team, regis-
tered some respectable placings with
Tarik (13th), Mike (25th), debutante Dan
Carrivick (26th) and Dave (29th).
match and 11-27 in the King's one only
to take the lead early in the second half.
These two victories seem to ensure our
College the first position in the Merit
League for the first time ever and what
is more, probably undefeated.
Now our thoughts are on Decem-
ber's draw for the knock-out stages. Pet-
haps this year we will have just the bit of
luck we missed in the last two years,
when we were narrowly (as narrowly as
possible, actually) eliminated at the
round of the last 16. Maturity and skills
ate abundant in this team which could
probably offer Imperial a place in the top
4 of Britain and perhaps even more...
RESULTS:
14/10 Imperial-GKT 71-58
21/10 UCH-Imperial 64-81
4/11 UCL-Imperial 50-57
11/11 King's - Imperial 55-63
Tennis
The IC Ladies team participated in the
BUSA league this term. We played 4

opponents). Results as follows:

Well done to all who played:
Alessia Toni, Lilaya Perera, Kathy Shair,

Annaig Jacquemard and Beatrice
Dereume.
Paul McKay led home an improving
second team (currently fifth in ULU).
Our foreign legion - Andreas (45th) and
Boaz (88th) - completed the IC line-up,
demonstrating ICs strength and depth.
We now look forward to the ULU
champs/qualifiers at Trent Park in two
weeks time where we can hopefully
field an even stronger field. Any tunners
