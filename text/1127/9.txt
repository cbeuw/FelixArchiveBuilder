Medicine Matters
So little time, so much to do.
I never really understand how it is that
I I can appear to be so busy without
1 actually achieving anything. This last
week has been like that.
The week started
with the frightening
news that the bar in the
Reynolds Building was
in threat of closure. This
was the first I had heard
of this particular crisis,
but obviously I have
been looking at the
world through rose
tinted glasses because
in clinic on Monday my
consultant asked if the
bar at the medical
school was still open.
He then went on to talk
about how important
that sort of facility was and what a shame
it would be if it were to close. Senior con-
sultant of one of the main teaching cen-
tres of the Imperial College School of
Medicine says that social areas are impor-
'Anyone seen or
suspected of not
drinking as much
as they could was
branded an IC lov-
ing traitor to the
medical school
spirit.'
tank It is a pity that none
of the paper-pushing
bureaucrats in Shcrfield listen to people
who know what they are talking about
when it comes to the
more practical aspects
of medical school life.
The next few days
saw frantic attempts to
save the bar from clo-
sure. Anyone seen or
suspected of not drink-
ing as much as they
could was branded an
IC loving traitor to the
medical school spirit.
Even at the height of
the Stalin pogroms or
the McCarthy witch-
hunts such random and
brutal accusations of
treason would not have been consid-
ered harsh, but I must add, fair!
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
mornings were characterised by the now
comfortable routine of two aspirin and a
Nick Newton
glass of water before hur-
rying off to theatre where
you play a game of one-upmanship with
your consultant about how bad you arc
feeling. The evenings
are taken up with
rehearsals for the;
Medics operatic society
production of Hello
Dolly, which I will start
plugging nice and early.
Friday night saw a
bop at Charing Cross
that was great fun! I was
pleased to see some IC
students who turned up
and, shock horror, actu-
ally seemed to be enjoy-
ing themselves. Ihe
way some people talk
about medics, the
South Ken lot seem to think that we
practice ritual acts of vivisection on any
non-medics who dare to cross the thresh-
old. Before you pass judgement on us
you should try coming down to I lam-

mersmith or Paddington (which is just
across the park anyway) and finding out
what we are really like - our beer is
cheap, we arc, when not provoked, an
extremely friendly
bunch of individuals
and there are some
great places to go out
in and around Ham-
mersmith.
I his is the start of
another long hard week
with no end in sight -
but at least for the time
being I will be able to
relax and unwind at the
Reynold's bar after work
each day. It really can-
not be stressed enough
how important the bar
is to IC, and those at
Charing Cross in particular. Everybody
should support it. Imagine it as an insur-
ance policy - you may not like paying it
but if you ever need il, you'll be really
glad it's there.
Presidential Talk-Back
Dave's Discount David Hellard,
Day' has finally
happened. Last Monday I spent my time
going around shops and phoning up
companies in order to save you guys a
few bucks. I'm not going to fully report
back to you yet, as during my tour of
around 80 shops I've picked up quite a
few loose ends that need to be sorted
out and tens of companies who need to
be phoned up. The results so far though
have been quite positive, although I still
have Gloucester Road, South Kensing-
ton, Paddington and Hammersmith to
do.
Having highlighted the position of
some of our campuses already in this arti-
cle, I wouid like to highlight the plight of
some of our furthest afield students in
Silwood Park. There are about 120 Impe-
rial students living in the middle of
nowhere near Ascot, but did you know
that they are home to Imperial's most
successful society? Last Thursday night
Andy Purvis defended his title of world
champion of tiddly winks against the
former holder Larry Kahn of America, I
don't know the result yet, but he is the
world record holder so he's not someone
to be messed with.
ICU President The health cen-
tre at the moment
does not open over lunch times,
because of staffing problems. This in my
opinion sounds mad - the one time that
students are free to go to appointments
it's not open, this has been flagged up
with the relevant people, but apparently
we also need to gauge student opinion,
so here I am. Do you think that it would
be a good idea for the health centre to
be open over lunch times? Email mc
your opinion at president@ic.ac.uk (the
more responses the more likely it is to
happen.)
Just a word of warning to end with,
last Thursday the Imperial College Union
Council discussed a new Disciplinary Pol-
icy. If it goes through it means that dis-
ciplinary offenses committed by clubs or
societies or a recognised subsection of
them could have their budgets frozen
(i.e. no more money for the rest of the
year), be banned from putting on any
other events or be suspended from any
activities they are currently involved in.
It will also come up at the next council,
but in the meantime be good.
