Les Miserables * * V 2
Starring : Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes
Director : Bille August

o, don't worry, it's not the big
screen version of the long run-
ning musical - only Woody Allen
would get I lollywood stars to sing on
film. Instead it's the adaptation of Victor
Hugo's classic novel (upon which the
musical and countless stage plays have
been based).
Sadly, however, the motivation
behind the movie becomes clear all too
rapidly. Picture the scene: some greedy
Hollywood producer is wandering
through the $1 classics section of his
local bookstore, looking for the next cos-
tume drama to provide a nice fat pay day.
He spots a copy of Les Miserables and
realised that the musical had done all the
publicity work for him. Money in the
bank, surely.
Well, probably not, thanks largely to
a phenomenally dull re-telling of a story
that's been committed to film fourteen
times before. Obviously, director August
(a Danish director who has only made
one film in the English language) was
under strict instructions not to deviate
from the standard costume drama tem-
plate - decent cast, nice location (Prague
pretending to be nineteenth century
Claire Danes sports Chanel's new "Costume Drama" look
Paris) and stirring strings on the sound-
track. Yet it's such a deadpan re-creation
of the original story that you may as well
be watching a movie about the history
of the French railway system.
You can't blame the cast; you can't
really blame the director; all you can do
is ponder why on earth this film got
made at all. Q

hink Beverly I lills 90210, and then
remove all the gloss, the smiles,
the affluence and any semblance
of happiness - and replace the lot with
mid seventies dysfunctionality. The
image you're left with should approxi-
mate to The Slums of Beverly Hills.
In reality, it's a pretty standard com-
ing of age drama, padded out with quirky
humour and all manner of eccentrics. It's
also loosely based on director Tamara
Jenkins own adolescent experiences, so
expect realism at every turn.
Thanks to the Odeon Kensington,
we've got ten - that's right, ten - pairs of
tickets to Slums to give away. To be in

Austin Powers
Vieing with There's Something About
Mary for the crown of most gut-wrench-
ingly funny movie of recent years, Austin
Powers: International Man of Mystery Is
one of the funniest movies I've ever
seen. Never fearing the blantantly obvi-
ous or overly crude gag, Mike Myers
(writer and star of Wayne's World) packs
ninety minutes with more comedy than
you can possibly take in at one sitting,
making this a great movie to buy.
In essence, it's a fairly basic parody
of sixties crimefighters (Bond in partic-
ular) meets the modern world. Yet it's
simply the quality of the writing, coupled
with great performances from the leads
(Mike Myers, Liz I lurley and Mike Myers)
and a top notch soundtrack that make
it so nearly perfect.
Tomorrow
Never Dies
Bond returns for the 18th time, once
again in the guise of Pierce Brosnan.
This time around the plot's straight from
the land of cheese, with Bond traipsing
across the globe (as ever) in an attempt
to stop the dastardly schemings of a
Rupert Murdoch-esque media barron.
Suffice to say, all the usual elements
are there - with Teri I latcher as the old
flame and Michelle Yeo on duty as the
foreign agent who can't resist his
charms. But it's the quality of the effects
- done for 'real', and as a result so much
better than today's CGI tests - that make
this a classy bit of Bond. The opening
sequence is superbly cheesy, and you'd
be hard pushed to find a sequence to
match the car-park chase in any of 007's
other outings.
Boogie Nights
I laving won massive critical acclaim ear-
lier this year, it's time to find out what
all the fuss was about. Boogie Nighrs is
undoubtedly original - offbeat and
downright weird - and it's depiction of
the late seventies porn world is bal-
anced perfectly between realism and
hilarity. The performances from the
leads are damn fine, particularly as the
film moves into phase two - what hap-
pens to the characters when their world
collapses and they're forced to venture
out intoreality. O
