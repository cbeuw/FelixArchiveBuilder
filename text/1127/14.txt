DIE YOUNG STAY PRETTY ICA
T
his is an exhibition of brand new art
brought to thc Institute of Con-
temporary Arts by the curator Mar-
tin Maloney. Twelve influential artists
have come together here to create some
very visually strong work. They draw inspi-
ration from 60s and 70s modern art, at
the same time conveying their own
vision. Dexter Dalwood's paintings are
amazingly colourful, very bright and dan-
gerously close to looking a bit over the
top. I le manages to strike the right bal-
ance between old themes, like Sharon
Tate's, house, and other more futuristic
aspects of architecture seen in his Lab-
oratoire Gamier piece. Jane Brennan also
paints, only her works are very small rep-
resentations of flowers, beads and birds.
It's very sweet but quite difficult to appre-
ciate although she does have a funny
touch; she paints on the sides of wooden
rectangles. Steven Gontarski makes
some very bizarre and exciting sculp-
tures out of synthetic hair and PVC, cre-
ating figures that seem to be right out of
some sci-fi novel [Wife, pictured left).
Other interesting features in the
exhibition include
some painted
resin animals
scattered all over
the gallery,
Raedecker's
empty land-
scapes that on
closer inspection
have a strong
impact, and Gary
Webb's very
clever sculptures,
also combining
the spirit of the
70s with the futur-
istic look of the
90s, using differ-
ent materials
including latex
and some beautiful colours. Finally, the
last painting in the gallery is by Martin
Maloney himself: a hilarious work called
hey good looking based on Poussin's
choice of Hercules. Two women are
admiring this young man who is very
skinny and amazingly unsexy. Perhaps
Maloney is opposing the image of the
ideal 90s man to the old cliche of the
strong and protective being.
The exhibition is very enjoyable and
miles away from thc hype of last year's
Sensation show at the Royal Academy.
Here, there is no provocation or intention
of shocking. It feels like art at its simplest,
as a mode of expression. But the work
on show also has meaning and tackles
lots of interesting issues like our fear of
the futute. Most
of it is very inven-
tive, often taking
old material or
ideas and just
injecting new life
into them. The
visual side is also
very striking -all
the pieces have a
very distinctive
character and
they do have a
strong pull. You
automatically stop
to look at every-
thing. Several
interviews with
the artists are also
displayed in thc
corridor leading to thc bar. They try to
explain their art a little, giving a few indi-
cations on where they get their ideas
from and how they decide which are
going to be used in their work. This pre-
sentation is a rare and very interesting
insight into an artist's life and inspiration.
The ICA has once again put on a bril-
liant show, rightly shying away from con-
troversy, concentrating instead solely on
the quality and impact of the artists. They
have all the space they need and it is
refreshing to see such an exhibition
within these walls. If you have never
been to the ICA, then this is the perfect
opportunity to go and check it out for
yourself.

T
he Industrial Revolution was a not
a good time for manual labourers.
Automatic looms, steam engines
and farming machinery removed the
dependency of agriculture and industry
on human hands, and consequently
caused great-hardship for these redun-
dant workers. The landowners and indus-
trialists who had ptcviously employed
vast numbers of-men saw their own for-
tunes expand massively and were, with
a few honourable exceptions, motivated
putcly by the balance sheet and untrou-
bled by the social upheaval they had
caused.
The First World War was the first total
armed conflict that Europe had ever
experienced, and it demonstrated that in
the absence of any clear technological or
geographical advantage the victor would
be the country with the most lives to
expend.
Working in 1920, the Czech writer
Karel Capek combined these two con-
cepts and introduced a third - auto-
mated labour. Of course, this is a bit of
a mouthful and not overly exciting, so
Capek took the Slav word for serfs - rob-
ota - and gave the world robots. If you're
an early 20th century Minister of War,
merchant banker or factory owner, you
like the sound of these robots. They
don't need subsidised social clubs, the
manufacturers only require a one-off
capital payment instead of monthly
wages fot human workers and if a
machine gun mows them down it's no
big deal. This is great, until the manu-
facturers give them too much intelli-
gence and the robots decide they're
better off without us.
So it's a standard 'technology can
rebound on us in unexpected ways' plot
device. This can work well, but only if the
ideas manifested in the plot are clearly
articulated with a viable scenario given
the circumstances. Sadly, with R.U.R. this
isn't always the case - especially in the
final scene, which attempts to suggest,
against incontrovertible evidence, that
some good can come of the situation.
The actots are all members of the
Court Theattc Ttaining Company, and
consequently the overall quality is not
that of the West tnd. The crowded first
half suffers from the small size of the the-
atre - Eric Morrison's arrogant Harry
Domin needs a significantly larger space
in which to declaim and strut. Gemma
Barnctson's Lady Helen Glory suffers
from an excess of bleeding heart, but thc
portrayal of her intellectual vapidity suf-
fcrs ftom thc actress' inability to con-
vincingly portray strong conviction or
emotion.
Ihe first half drifts somewhat, and
there is no air of suspense at what should
be a climatic final scene before thc inter-
val. In fact, it was handled so matter-of-
factly by the cast that I wasn't even sure
if there was going to be a second half.
However, this is where it all changes. The
main character fot most of the second
half is Construction Engineer Alquist,
played byjonnic Barnetson. This man sin-
gle-handedly takes R.U.R. and transforms
it from an interesting production to an
arresting performance. I'm not going to
spoil the plot by telling you the exact cir-
cumstances that force Alquist into thc
limelight, but his portrayal of an emo-
tionally starved and half-crazed prisoner
asked to perform beyond his capabilities
is utterly convincing.
R.U.R. is an enjoyable evening of
accessible entertainment with a strong
conclusion, and while the quality is not
that of the West End, neither are thc
ticket prices; on Sundays you pay what
you feel you can afford.
