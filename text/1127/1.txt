College Beit Back
Despite promises of additional space
when Beit Quad is renovated which span
at least the last two years, the Union dis-
covered last week that its net gains from
the development could be virtually zero.
At a meeting held on 12 November,
College's latest design proposals were
unveiled by the architects behind the
project. Under these plans, the Union will
gain the basements in the west wing of
the Quad, but it will lose several areas on
its East and West staircases - including the
Dramsoc workshop, bar manager's flat
and dressing rooms-and all of the space
currently occupied in the South base-
ment - primarily the ICSE library.
Although the West Wing basements
could in theory provide homes for all
these needs, they are already earmarked
for, amongst others, Felix and IC Radio -
who both stand to become homeless in

the next few years. Furthermore, work on
the Quad redevelopment will start at the
beginning of next July, and the Union will
only be allowed to start work on reno-
vating the basements a year later. Clearly,
space is going to come at a very high pre-
mium next year - indeed as it stands
Felix could find itself relocated to Porta-
cabins come next Summer.
All this, however, comes in the wake
of a promise to dramatically increase
Union space. In a report dated July 1996,
the Rector's Committee on Social &
Recreational Space recommended that
"When Biology move from Beit to BMS,
the IC Union should occupy the base-
ments of the East and West sides of the
Beit Quadrangle" (the Union had already
been promised some of the South base-
ments). This recommendation came in
the wake of figures compiled by College
which showed that social space at South
Ken represents approximately half that
recommended by the funding council.
Yet, in their own words, "for the College
to have good social and recreational facil-
ities is likely to be a factor in attracting
good applicants." Clearly, adequate
Union provision makes commercial
sense.
As a result of this assurance, the
Union has planned for two years to utilise
this new space - indeed the forthcoming
relocation of Union media to the West
Wing allowed this Summer's dB's expan-
sion to take place.
Nonetheless, the group steering the
project remain adamant that in order for
the business plan to "work" the Union
cannot have any more space. Instead,
their plans include space for a grand
total of 363 beds - of which, somewhat
suspiciously, only 309 will be occupied by
students. Of the 263 rooms, 102 will be
en-suite singles, and there is also pro-
jected space for couples and perhaps
even children.
This will produce what the design
report describes as "a mix of accommo-
dation favourable for conference/holi-
day letting purposes." Indeed this drive
for top class conference facilities (the
driving force behind many recent build-
ing projects) looks like producing what
has been described as "luxury accom-
modation" - which raises the question:
How much are students going to be
asked to pay?
Marching for More Money
By Ed Sexton
A Socialist Worker demonstration against
tuition fees was held in London last
Wednesday. The protesters, mostly stu-
dents, marched from the University of
London Union to Hyde Park causing
many of the West End's central routes to
be closed for the afternoon.
Several thousand protesters left ULU
at around 1pm in good spirits, braving
the cold November air and the threat of
rain. Universities from around the UK
were represented, as well as members of
Socialist Worker and other followers of
the socialist movement, the march pro-
ceeded slowly, shouting various slogans
through London, including "Fight! Fight!
Fight! Tuition fees are shite!", "They say
cut back - we say fight back!" and "What
do we want? Free education! When do
we want it? Now!" The demonstrators
sat down in the street on several occa-
sions, even starting a rendition of 'Sit
Down' in Welbeck Street. Shopkeepers
and the business community came out
of their offices, curious as to what was
going on, with one suit-clad bystander
commenting "all this for bloody stu-
dents." In Orchard Street, a centre for
London's commercial sector, the chants
The demonstration
became more political; "Tuition fees -
no way! Tax the rich, make them pay!"
As the march continued down Oxford
Street, approaching Speaker's Corner,
Christmas shoppers were treated to
repeated cries of "Up yours' lony!" and
"You can stuff tuition fees up your arse".
In the Park the crowd was addressed
by the organisers and then by Tony Benn
MP, who gave his support to the cam-
paign for free education. "The right to
education is a basic human right" he
argued, before criticising current gov-

ernment policy on education and the
welfare state. "How long will it be before
you have to have a loan to go to school?"
he asked. Attacking the National Union
of Students' lack of action on the matter,
he jibed that the campaign would be
helped "if you can convert the NUS to
fight for students." He urged students to
join with other groups fighting cutbacks
in the welfare state, such as widowed
pensioners and disabled persons, ending
with an optimistic shout of "We're going
to win this campaign!"
