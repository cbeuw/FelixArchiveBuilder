Futurecop - LAPD Tenchu - Stealth Assassins
Electronic Arts • • • • • Activision • • • •
Diplomatic Police test their new traffic
cone theft deterrent
Those red diplomatic police cars with
submachine guns, shotguns and pistols
speeding to the sandwich shop might
look a little bit tasty, but this game is set
in the future where red Mondeos would-
n't make it round the corner let alone
pick up a rather nice half price sandwich
after 4pm.
As a futurecop you get a shiny new
armour plated and heavily armed robot,
which can transform into a speedy hov-
ertank, then shoot, dodge and jump
your way round the urban dystopia
known as Los Angeles. You also get a
choice of two games. Precinct Assault is
the simplest, where you take on either
an Al or human in an attempt to get a
drone tank into the enemy control cen-
tre before the opponent does the same.
So build tanks to attack, choppers to
defend and turn neutral turrets to your
side and humiliate your friends.
Crime War is the better of the two
games, though, as your robot gets to
take on a series of story-based levels in
an attempt to make the streets safe until
the sequel is finished, or the next futur-
istic cop game is released. There might
be an unfair advantage in having mini-
guns, homing missiles and mortars
against rocket carrying criminals, but
what they lack in firepower they make up
for in numbers, so conserving ammo
and sneak attacks (sorry; did I forget to
shout armed police before mowing
down the men on the roof) is the strat-
egy which will preserve the paintwork.
Addictive gameplay is just part of
an excellent game. Fortunately the
graphics are equally excellent. The light-
ing effects are possibly the best yet seen
on the Playstation where explosions light
up the surrounding area, and shrapnel
shoots into the air. There is also a com-
plete lack of pop-up thanks to the use of
an Intelligent following camera and the
heavily built up urban levels. Move over
Robocop,- there's a new guy in town, and
this one's built to survive.

thing in sight.
Unfortunately
it is the need to
move smoothly
and swiftly cou-
pled with rather
poor control
method which
that prevents this
game from being
an all time classic.
In many cases the
control method

designed to

Silent assassins, one with the night. Sony
has intertwined the legends and deeds
of these honour bound hit-men and
women with the modern third person
action-adventure game. Starting with a
simple tutorial level, the assassination of
a rich merchant at his home, it then
introduces a story where the delivery of
secret messages and rescuing hostages
are just part of your everyday job - all on
the orders of your master.
If you arc expecting a fast action, no
brain required game, pass on this one;
it is definitely more of a thinking game.
Escape and evasion from your enemy is
much more profitable than charging
around attempting to slaughter every-
you want to do it. Ten minutes scam-
pering across the roof hidden from all
will be completely wasted as you fall off
the roof directly in front of a pike carry-
ing foe. If you finally manage to better
the beast that is the control system, (why
there is no analog controller option is a
question for Sony) then the secrets of the
night are yours. Creep up to foes, and if
you get close to them before they hear
or see you, watch the grisly execution
scenes. Bungle it, though, and they'll
charge towards you in an attempt to
turn you into a nice ninja kebab. The
world of the Ninja is a dark and nasty
one.
