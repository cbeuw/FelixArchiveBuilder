The Backroom Launch Party!
Y
r
ou might
have already
been thereto
check out The Elec-
tric Cafe, but this
Friday heralds the
launch of South-
side Bar's premier
venue, The Backroom. Boasting a selec-
tion of Imperial College Radio DJ's cov-
ering the entire musical spectrum, The
Backroom is guaranteed to bring you
something a bit more off beat than you
have come to expect from the other
local student clubs.
The launch party will give you a pre-
view of what to expect in future weeks
from the two new nights starting up to
coincide with the launch. The party
begins with an hour-long preview of 'The
Rhythm Kitschin', a brand new cordon-
bleu musical experience cooked up by
your host The Chef. It's a veritable feast
of music from funky hip-hop through
cool Acid Jazz to smooth Drum 'n' Bass.
After the launch party 'Rhythm Kitschin'
will be every other Thursday in The Back-
room, running in rotation with the ever
excellent Electric Cafe.
The launch party will then give you
a full-on feel of our regular Friday night
experience. Guest DJ's will be playing out
the widest possible choice of music, vary-
ing from 70s funk with DJ Phil to the lat-
est happy hardcore mixed together by
the one and only DJ Desire. Other nights
coming soon include a house night, with
guest DJ Clarke playing some relaxed
and mellow cuts, and DJ Sianide playing
a hard house night for those who like it
a bit faster.
On the launch night we'll be giving
away loads of free stuff, plus you'll be
able to meet the Dj's and give us feed
back about what you want to hear. IC
Radio boasts DJ's covering virtually every
conceivable musical style, so we're cer-
tain to be able to meet every one of your
demands, whatever they are. You'll also
be able to experience our updated
sound and light system and renovated
decor, as well as the completely mod-
ernised music policy.
If you are impressed by the quality of
what you hear, our DJ's arc available for
hire for private functions at a very com-
petitive price. IC Radio will take all the
hassle away from organising the music,
as we have our very own lighting and
sound system which we will set up for
you. Our DJ's will cater for your every
whim and desire (as far as the music is
concerned), from a cheesy 80s disco to
the latest cutting edge dance. Whatever
your tastes, whatever you want, you
know who to call.
The Backroom' takes off at last
News
N
ext week the IC Radio page will
have a NEW™ and EXCITING®
format. Every week we'll suggest
a different show to check out on IC
Radio, which you can record in the com-
fort of your own kitchen. Printed in Felix
the following week will be a tape box
sleeve with the mixlist of the tunes
played. If you put the two together, you'll
have your very own free and exclusive IC
Radio tape. The first show featured is
'Sianide & Desire' (both Backroom DJ's)
on their weekly happy hardcore show.
Check it out on Thursday 26 November
between 10 and 11pm.
Wednesday brings you a brand new
lunch time show, brought to you by
Knickers and Pants, featuring 'The Top
I C U C I N E M A PRESENTS:
Ten at Ten To', (a top ten of anything
from fare dodging to swearing) and T elix
from the Flames' (a look at 20 years of
Felix), it promises to be fairly reasonable.
They're also going to experiment with
real time cooking - the idea being that
we'll tell you how to make a quick, tasty
lunchtime snack while you cook - it could-
n't be easier. You can then bring a sam-
ple down to the radio, and the best
effort will get a no expense spared prize.
The first recipe will be Spaghetti Car-
bonara, so to take part make sure you
have onion, garlic, bacon, cheese,
spaghetti, single cream, an egg, and a
good sense of humour.
To hire out our DJ's contact Simon at
djsianlde@hotmail.com, or call In at IC
Radio at any time. The Knickers and
Pants Show' is every Wednesday
lunchtime from 12-2pm.
