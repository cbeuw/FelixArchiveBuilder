RSM Football
RSM 11-7 QMW RSM II 10-0 GKT IV
RSM first XI took the field in a dazzling
new strip for what surely had to be their
first full match back in the top flight UtU
football for over five years, with a home
fixture against last year's champions
QMW.
Thc disappointment of having an
away match with Goldsmiths cancelled
and the cruel and crushing injury dealt
to former captain Simon Hiscocks (who
could now be out of football for up to
two years) at the abandoned match with
Royal Holloway the previous week made
this week's task seem insurmountable.
But new skipper Martin Masefield was
keen for his new team to get 90 minutes
of Premiership football under their belts.
fhe match started evenly with both
sides finding their feet on what was a
heavily sodden Harlington pitch. RSM
could have even taken the lead after only
fifteen minutes when midfielders John
Williams and Nigel Miiner linked up well,
in a move that culminated in a ripsnorter
from Miiner that slid agonisingly past
the post.
The deadlock, howevet, was broken
by QMW after a further five minutes
when some questionable RSM defend-
ing allowed QMW's number 10 to guide
the ball into the RSM net.
Despite RSM's best efforts, QMW had the
taste for goals and numbers two three
and four followed alarmingly soon, leav-
ing the miners with an even greater hill
to climb in the second half.
Masefield rallied his posse and it
was in the twenty minutes after the
break that RSM enjoyed the most dom-
inant period of thc match getting a goal
back after another probing run from
Williams resulted in a spot kick that the
player himself converted.
Yet it was only a matter of time
before the QMW frontline caught thc
scent of the goal again, although only
after RSM keeper Mark Dwyers brilliantly
saved a penalty.
He was left helpless, though, as fif-
teen minute before full time the RSM
backline was torn apart like a hamburger
in Somalia.
Twice more QMW found the net,
making the final score 1-7.
So are the RSM boys doomed to a
seasons the Premiership-licking boys?
Not from what this reporter saw. With
a few more matches to remove the rust,
this well-oiled machine could easily hold
its own.
Business as usual. We absolutely slaugh-
tered the opposition from beginning to
end in all areas of thc field and despite
them getting in a couple of chances
here and there, we showed once again
that we were not just a cut above the
rest, but at least a few divisions higher
in standard. They were an absolute
bunch of whiners who obviously hadn't
played real football before!
OK, we were a bit worried after
about 10 minutes because we hadn't
scored, but a lovely lofted ball over their
defence fell to yours truly who struck the
ball in the left corner. It was great to
start the steamroller moving. To be fair
their defence was crap, but that only
made us hungrier for goals. Goals came
from Davey Eagle (2), Craig (2), Pieman
Phil (2) [great volley Philll, Donnie Brasco
aliasjon Kennard and Gl ILS Marky Mark,
who not only got his first hat-trick but
also picked up a groin stain after scor-
ing. Well done Andy Mason for leaving
his mark in more ways than one on thc
TGK defence.
So, we've now won four out of four,
with a goal difference of +26. Is there
anything that can stop us? We look for-
ward to thc challenge. Mark

IC 1st XI 4 - 0 Royal Vets.
We turned up to the game knackered
and pissed off as the journey had taken
2 hours, fortunately for thc opposition
we only had half a team and only time
for half a game. I lowevcr, wc shafted
them 4-0. Legends? I think so. Come
on Barbados.
IC Ladies 1st XI
No score given
We seemed to have been on the pitch
for only a few moments and yet to the
opposition it must have seemed like
hours. "Amusing Bird" played as good
as she smells. "Wife" cooked-up a deli-
cious performance in the circle and thc
"ladcl" of thc match was left pissed in
the minibus (walkover: Kings).
IC Ladies II 0 - 8 RHUL II
Ladies 2nd team had a great match
against RHUL. Patsy drove us lo the
match in style, Jean Claude and Chun-
derbird did a fantastic job as umpires.
The team spirit was excellent. I haven't
mentioned the score yet so it's safe to
assume that we lost 8-0. However,
RHUL were also disappointed as they
had needed to score 10-0 to win out
BUSA group, so actually we were very
successful and anyway we all had a bril-
liant time.
