o to Thc Gallery, The music In gen-
eral is very uplifling house and nu-
•nergy driven tunes that keep you
miling all night despite the prices at
?port would membersh following but It is not
g. People even smile
crowoea, especially in the main
dancefloor, and there isn't anything
more frustrating than listening to
some of the best DJs around without
being able to dance (not unless you
want to rub up against the ten other
sweaty people within an inch of you).
You just shouldn't let lhat many peo-
ple into a club of the size of Turnmills
'cos it lakes away from the enjoy-
ment of the people Inside And, after
all, thai is what counts when you
are clubbing and what makes nights
legendary. Bui I suppose lhat The
Gallery Is now highly commercial,
almost corporate clubbing.
Moaning aside, the highlights
of the night, were as usual the; two
headlincrs. And with Judge Jules
helping out resident giant Tall Paul
the roof was practically blown off
the venue lor a good few hours.
The Eclectronica room was also stun-
ning with the men behind thc decks
sticking true to the name of the
room and playing it varied as you
was there - well cool. Ihere are also
plenty of bar areas to chill out In and
spiky everything appears to be.
Go, but don't bring your mates
(please!)
