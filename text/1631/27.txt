inishing top of the league
with a goal difference
of 199, the undefeated
Imperial Ladies Lacrosse
1st
team are having a phenomenal
season.
This is the first time that we have
won the league undefeated.
Our season finished with a 22-2
victory over Royal Holloway in
an intense and aggressive match.
Highlights from the season include
smashing UCL, our biggest rivals,
24-2 and our incredible Fresher,
Arianna Guppy, receiving Dick of
the Day for every single match.
Our success this year stems
from the dedication of the squad
to an increased number of training
sessions, an amazing new cohort of
Freshers who add a new attacking They’re an unstoppable force. Photo Credit: Imperial Lacrosse
The first team came top of the league
element to a historically defensive
team,and the most amazing support
from the club as a whole, especially
from our president David Reed who
has led many excursions deep into
the bin.
Final year, Ahranee Canden, has
been unshakeable this season in
goal, only letting in 23 goals in the
league. She is an amazing asset to
the team and will be sorely missed
next season.
Vice Captain Georgie Carson
has been an incredible force in the
mid-field play and has lead dynamic
attacking plays, converting scores of
opportunities.
However, the season is not over
yet and with the team vying for
promotion to the Premiership
training never ends. Promotion to
the premiership would be a first for
Lacrosse, and any new recruits to
Med and Nicky’s Fan Club would
be gratefully received.
T
he Cross Country team
began the road season in
breath-taking style last
weekend, storming to
victory in the Men’s team category
at the Salisbury 10 mile. A road
race that ranks in stature alongside
the likes of the London Marathon,
the Tour de France, and the Indy
500; fourteen of Imperial’s leanest
athletes took to this hallowed
start line with the scent of success
in their nostrils. With Chris
Thomas’s infamous bowels suitably
cleared, the starting gun heralded
the passing of 723 runners over
undulating tarmac that ran through
exotic Wiltshire countryside.
Team gold was the men’s objective,
and the team’s strategy was perfectly
executed.With the top four runners
scoring, Chris Thomas and James
Ellis paired up at the front with
individual silverware in sight,
while Matt Douthwaite took Alex
Warnakulasuriya for a run that
was metronomically paced by our
towering stalwart. Tom Miller.
AdamMalagowski,DuncanIngram,
Lewis Jackson, Anil Keshwani and
Willy Bonneuil all ran admirably in
pursuit in a team performance that
embodied the spirit of our club.This
is a group that fights equally as hard
for collective success as it does for
personal bests, and this spirit was
reflected in everyone’s results.
Local hero Alex Mundell, Leanne
Lyons and Antoinette Hardijzer
represented the ladies. What they
lacked in numbers they made up
for in their performances. Alex blew
the Senior Ladies field to pieces in
one hour and eight minutes,coming
fifth in her category. Leanne and
Antoinette followed home in
superb fashion, finishing eighth and
thirty-fourth respectively in times
that beckon great seasons for both
of them. There is great potential for
a ladies’ team victory in the near
future, and our results will surely
tempt more members of the Club
onto the road, giving us the girls
and firepower we need to win the
honours we deserve.
The men’s victory was secured
with an aggregate time of three
hours and 48 minutes. All four
runners covered the distance
in under an hour, putting three
minutes between Imperial and
Lordshill Road Runners. Chris and
James received silverware for their
second and fourth place finishes,
and the men were awarded a cup
sizeable enough to fulfil a number
of functions at our next social.
Reports of Alex Warna depositing
his breakfast several times on the
finishing straight are unconfirmed
after an epic sprint finish.
Special credit goes to incoming
Ladies’ Captain Alex Mundell,
who managed the team so capably
throughout the weekend. This truly
was one of the highlights of the
athletics calendar.Our rival London
The Imperial March
colleges will look upon these results
with trepidation, as we continue the
Imperial March on the track,for the
first round of the LCAS track and
field championships this weekend.
The team’s
strategy
was
perfectly
executed Off they go! Photo Credit: IC Cross Country
