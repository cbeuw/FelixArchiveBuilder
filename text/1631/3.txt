38% increase in Imperial students seeking
counselling
3.7% of students sought counselling last academic year
...continued from front page
Last year, Mentality surveyed over
1000 students on their mental health
and stress levels. It found that three
out of four Imperial students either
had been diagnosed with a mental
health issue or suffered from stress.
There are currently no provisions
for counselling at the Charing Cross
campus, despite recommendations
from both Mentality and previous
ICSM officers. The Deputy
President (Welfare) reported to
union council in October that the
head of counselling had said “that

igeons fitted with ultralight
air-monitoring vests have
been flying across London
this week in an attempt
to highlight the capital’s pollution
problem.
The ten pigeons,which were flying
around London until Wednesday,
were monitoring levels of nitrogen
dioxide and ozone. People can tweet
their location at the company, and
get an update on the air pollution
levels in their area, as found by the
group’s pigeons. Researchers back at
Imperial will be analysing the data. No, seriously, the pigeons are wearing vests. Photo Credit: Twitter/ @PigeonAir
Pigeons fly about 30m off the
ground, which means the data
they collect on compounds in the
air are relevant for humans. Their
backpacks weigh about 25g.
The ‘Pigeon Air Patrol’ is the
combined effort of Plume Labs, a
marketing and technology agency,
Twitter and researchers from
Imperial’sCentreforEnvironmental
Policy.
The idea won organisers
the London Design Festival’s
#PoweredbyTweets competition
last year, which saw them awarded
free Twitter ads to get the project
started.
Later this year, the project will
expand, abandon pigeons, and use
humans carrying sensors to monitor
pollution levels. The company plans
to get members of the public to carry
light sensors that talk to an app on
their phones and a wider network
of “air patrollers”. This part of the
project is still at the crowdfunding
stage.
Last year, the nitrogen dioxide
levels on Oxford Street broke the
legal limit by a thousand times.
The high concentration of diesel
fuelled buses are suspected to be
a contributory factor Last year, a
study from King’s College London
estimated that long term exposure
to nitrogen dioxide and particulates
in London’s air were killing nearly
10,000 people a year.

The results are being tweeted at concerned citizens
if it is at all possible, the student
counselling service will provide
some form of service” at Charing
Cross. There is some availability at
Silwood.
DPW, Jennie Watson, told
FELIX: “Although it’s positive in
some ways that students are seeking
help, it is high time universities
started addressing the causes of poor
mental health among students. I
can think of a hundred reasons why
being a student is far more stressful
than it was when I started university
in 2010, however, there is still very
little being done to demonstrably
reduce these stresses.”
“Allowing students to fall into
crisis rather than preventing them
reaching that point in the first place
is an abandonment of a university’s
duty of care to its students.” She
said.
A college spokesperson cited
a line in the college strategy for
2015-20 which is to “prioritise the
mental well-being of the student
body” and told FELIX: “There
has been a nationwide increase in
students using counselling services
over recent years. At Imperial,
following a review of student health

and wellbeing services in 2014,
the College has made a significant
additional investment in student
support services, with an increase
of 6.5 FTE staff across Student
Counselling and the Disability
Advisory Service. This includes the
appointment of a new full-time
Student Mental Health Adviser.”
Other Russell group universities
have also seen an increase in requests
for similar services. Edinburgh has
seen a hike of 75%, Leeds 57% and
Oxford 43%.
Data was gained from a Freedom
of Information request, and
various pocket guides to Imperial’s
demographics.
