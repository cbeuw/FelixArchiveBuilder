y fool-proof method
for determining
whether a biopic
is good or not is as
follows:ifIgoinwithnoknowledge/
interest in its subject matter, and
1) understand what’s going on
the whole time, and; 2) become
genuinely invested in its subject
matter, then it passes. Senna was the
first majorly successful documentary
film produced by the quintessential
British studio Working Title, best
known for rom coms such as Love
Actually and Notting Hill. Looking
into it, it’s clear that the film was
made as a passion project courtesy
of Woking Title founder, producer,
and massive F1 buff Tim Bevan.
This passion is contagious.The story
told here is that of Ayrton Senna,
the three-time Formula One world
champion who died tragically in a
crash at the young age of 34. This
tragically premature death, televised
to 300 million people, deeply shook
the world of F1. The main things
explored include a cataloguing
of Senna’s rise to success, the
importance of his icon-status in his
native Brazil, and his rivalry with
former partner Alain Prost.
It’s hard to describe what makes
this film work so well. The repeated
use of home and amateur footage
perhaps goes some way to helping
though, a feature carried over by
director Asif Kapadia in his recent
Oscar-winner Amy. The use of
such footage gives a more intimate
experience, allowing the viewer
to form closer connections to the
people documented, and become
invested in their story.The avoidance
of ‘talking head’ interviews is also
something which I feel adds to
its uniqueness. But ultimately it’s
the editing, stellar soundtrack, and
flawless pacing which make Senna
such an incredible film to watch.
The rivalry that Senna had with
former teammate Prost is also
brilliantly complex. The two men
are very well portrayed, and one
really gets to know their individual
characters and motivations –
Kapadia was extremely lucky to
have such an engrossing story
on which to base his biography.
One of the weaker points of the
documentary, however, comes from
the exploration of some of the
sport’s politics. This is not to say
that these sections are poorly done,
it’s just that,as someone who is not a
fan of the sport,these sections didn’t
fascinate me as much. Nevertheless,
Senna is a masterclass on how to put
together an engrossing, emotive and
informative biopic. I might even
watch the new F1 season now, who
knows.

Anomalisa
Dir: Charlie Kaufman, Duke
Johnson. Script: Charlie Kaufman.
Starring: David Thewlis, Jennifer
Jason Leigh, Tom Noonan. 90
minutes.
A
nomalisa begins with a
single voice. Or maybe
single voices. Multiple
copies of Tom Noonan’s
voice pile up over a blank screen,
creating a wall of unintelligible
sound. It’s a panoply of voices. A
cacophony of voices. An oppression
of voices.
This is what life is like for Michael
Stone (David Thewlis), a customer
service guru in Cincinnati for a
convention, whose inescapable
ennui has rendered everyone around
him – his wife, his child, his ex-
girlfriend – indistinguishable,
speaking in the same bland voice,
and wearing the same mask-like
face. We follow Michael as he
looks up an old flame, tries to
buy a toy for his son, and has a
potentially life-changing encounter
with Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh),
the only person in this nightmare
with a unique voice. Anomalisa
conducts itself through a detailed
examination of the wonderful
minutiae of the everyday; these
experiences – ordering room service,
walking along dark streets – are the
ones that truly form us, influencing
the direction of our lives.
Directors Charlie Kaufman
and Duke Johnson opted for an
unorthodox animation method,
making use of stop-motion
techniques with 3D-printed
models. The result is a sense of
unease that initially leaves you in
the lurch; characters’ faces have
splits along the middle, giving
everyone the sense they are wearing
wire-frame glasses, and their skin
gives an impression of softness, like
the downy surface of a peach. Much
of the focus of 3D printing has been
on its possible impacts on weapons
manufacture, or heavy industry, but
what about how it can print off an
expression of longing? Or capture
the nuances of a forced grin?
This style, along with the
omnipresence of Noonan’s voice,
sits like a heavy weight, making for
uneasy watching at first. However,
as the story progresses we no longer
notice it, engrossed in the unfolding
tale of tenderness playing out in
front of us. And then it’s brought
to our attention again, and suddenly
the whole set-up makes sense. It’s a
magical moment, one that expands
the powers of cinema. To speak
more of it would be to lessen its
impact.
While Anomalisa may seem like a
classic tale of short-lived intimacy,
a romance that falls away as the
sun comes up, the actual film is a
much stranger, off-putting beast.
Kaufman and Johnson do not try
and make things enjoyable for the
viewer, putting us through Stone’s
agonisingly awkward encounters,
making palpable the unbridgeable
gap between himself and others.
Anyone who has touched down late
at night knows the feeling made
clear in Anomalisa, which by and
large takes place in neutral spaces:
the back of a taxi cab; the arrivals
area of an airport; the faceless hotel
room, stacked up with innumerable
other identical cubes in the
Fregoli Hotel (Fregoli Delusion: a
psychiatric disorder characterised by a
belief that multiple people are the same
person in disguise). A hotel room is
another world, a beige world, one
where – if only for a night – you can
be someone else, somewhere else.
It’s an anomaly, a break-point with
your old life, from which you came
and to which you will return. It can
be the loneliest place in the world.
Kaufman and Johnson make
coherent this myriad of impressions.
The room becomes an emblem
for the alienation of Stone, who
is really, above all, simply tired.
Thewlis imbues his northern lilt
with a lethargic quality, one that
only lifts when he meets Lisa. Jason
Leigh is, similarly, stellar, with her
quiet, strained delivery of Cyndi
Lauper's ‘Girls Just Wanna Have
Fun’becoming one of the emotional
centre-points of the film.
TherearelinkstoLostinTranslation
here, but for me, the closest link
is to the work of the late Satoshi
Kon, particularly his 2006 film
Paprika, which shared Anomalisa’s
beguiling sense of stepping into
a waking dream, crafting a world
that is simultaneously familiar and
unapproachable. A sterling piece of
work from Kaufman and Johnson,
Anomalisa is a modern marvel, an
exploration of what it means to be
human. It’s not about how we feel
love, or how we feel pain. Anomalisa
is really just about how we feel.
