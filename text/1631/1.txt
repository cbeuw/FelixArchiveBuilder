38% INCREASE IN IMPERIAL
STUDENTS SEEKING
COUNSELLING
T
here has been a 38%
increase in students
seeking counselling
services from college
over the last three years,despite only
a 5% increase in students over the
same period.
Last year’s figures were also up
12% from the year before.
In the 2014/15 academic year,
3.7% of the student population,
including part-timers, sought
help from college counselling. In
2011/12,the 441 who did accounted
for 2.8% of students.
There are currently nine
counsellors working as part of
the Imperial counselling service,
whose work hours amount to 6.6
full-time equivalent (FTE) staff.
This is up from 5.4 FTE staff last
year. The counselling service had
had its budget frozen, so staffing
had remained at 5.4 for two years
running.
Notorious for its long waiting
times, last year the counselling
service was given the budget to
employ two extra members of staff.
The service is free, confidential
and for students only, although staff
are welcome to speak to counsellors
about concerns over their students,
and personal tutors often refer
students to it.
So why the increase? Mental
health charity,Mind,told ITV News
it believed the hike was down to the
rise in tuition fees. College officials
are likely to see this as a of result
better advertising of the counselling
and heightened awareness of what’s
provided, due to campaigns like
Mentality. However, the results of
this only came out last May, and
are unlikely to have spurred such an
increase in demand. It also doesn’t
explain the 15% jump in people
seeking services from 2011 to 2012.
Last year’s Mentality Survey
report recommended that the
counselling service at Imperial
needed to improve provisions at
“key times”, including the exam
period, although mentioned that
waiting times for the service had
improved since the year before.
