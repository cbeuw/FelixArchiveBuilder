S
ince arriving at Imperial,
I have been extremely
impressed with our students’
excellence. I’ve seen brilliant
scholars explaining their research,
talented entrepreneurs describing
their spin-out company and gifted
musicians inspiring a rapt audience.
I love to walk through College in
the evening and see the ballroom
dance team practicing with the jazz
band rehearsing next door.This is an
incredible place thanks to the great
talent, energy and motivation of our
students.
Excellent
education
is far more
than getting
a degree
certificate
We strive to
continually
enhance
our
teaching
Consulting
students
on the
decisions
that directly
affect them
is important
Imperial staff care deeply
about providing students with an
excellent education. Recently the
Council, our governing body, met
with union sabbatical officers at
an away-day. We discussed what
we want the future of Imperial to
look like, and how the “product” of
a university education was perhaps
less important than the “experience”
of it. Learning is a process and one
can never achieve a state of having
learnt all there is to know.
So, what do we mean when we
talk about excellence in education? I
think we mean that the knowledge,
experiences and relationships
students gain during their studies
are affirming, and, in many ways,
life-changing. Excellent education
is far more than getting a degree
certificate, and one’s education
does not stop with graduation. Our
aim is to ensure that the education
Imperial students receive prepares
them for excellence throughout
their lives.
We know that we value a highly
rigorous research-led curriculum
that enables students to engage
actively with research in their
disciplines and across disciplinary
boundaries. To be immersed in
one of the world’s top research
universities gaining knowledge and
experiences from the leaders in
their fields is one of the hallmarks
of Imperial’s educational experience.
We also value opportunities for
students to delve into the unknown,
experience the discovery of research,
and be creative and entrepreneurial.
We have made providing these
opportunities an important part of
our college strategy.
We strive to continually enhance
our teaching and we aspire to move
to the forefront in developing new
ways of teaching and learning that
combine our use of technology
and our time together to optimise
the knowledge, experience and
relationships gained.
We know that there are aspects of
our student experience that are not
excellent and we need to improve.
The mental well-being of students
is of paramount importance to
their lives and success, and we are
enhancing our portfolio of student
support services. We are also
focused on providing timely and
useful assessment and feedback and
excellent research supervision and
mentoring.
In my speech to the community
on March 17th
, I was pleased to
announce some new grants for
building excellence in teaching and
research to move the College to the
forefront of 21st
century education.
Our new Vice Provost (Education)
Professor Simone Buitendijk will
oversee the awarding and evaluation
of these grants.
Consulting students on the
decisions that directly affect them
is important. We do this primarily
through the elected sabbatical
officers leading the student union.
They,andotherstudentleadersofthe
hundreds of clubs and societies, set
the policies, tone and environment
for the student experience. One
of their important projects is their
current work on a “Respect for
Others” guide for students. This
will be a code of behaviour and
social expectations for students that
builds upon the “Respect for Others
Guide” that we produced last year
for staff. Like the staff guide, the
student guide will include a Respect
for Others Pledge. And just as we
expect all staff members to know
and live by the Pledge, so will we
expect students to do the same.
Why is this important? We have
a wonderful community of over
22,000 people – it is a dynamic and
vibrant environment where students
willspendsomeoftheirbestdaysand
have some of their most memorable
experiences. It is important to
recognise that there are times when
we fall far short of excellence and in
fact create very negative experiences
for our peers and our community.
While I love to talk to students and
celebrate their talent, creativity and
dedication, I am deeply unhappy
to read reports of some students
undermining themselves and their
teammates by drinking themselves
sick and damaging property or
others being disrespectful to their
peers and their community. None
of us want our community to be
harmed or individuals to be hurt by
the mistakes and thoughtlessness of
a few.
Imperial students excel at taking
on hard challenges and daunting
projects. Where else can you see
student productions of Sweeney
Todd and Petrushka in the same
week? I know that we can meet
the challenge of providing the
best environment and culture for
students. We can work together
to do better and I am optimistic
that affirming our values through
“Respect for Others” will help us
to avoid these mistakes and make
the Imperial student experience
excellent for all.
Providing an excellent education
for our students is a top priority
at Imperial. Doing so requires
enduring commitment by all of us,
staff and students alike.I believe that
together we can achieve excellence
and we can show the world what an
excellent education looks like.
