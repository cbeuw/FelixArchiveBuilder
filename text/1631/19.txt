efore Grimes bursts
onto stage at the Brixton
Academy, there’s a sense
that she’s compensating
for something: we would usually
expect the venue to be playing the
usual warm-up mix of inoffensive
R&B and indie pop – the standard
fare for off-piste artists like
Grimes, who straddle populism
and experimentalism – but tonight
they’ve opted for a succession
of classical string pieces. There’s
something deliberate about it.
Followingthereleaseofherbreakout
third LP, Visions, which catapulted
her onto the world stage, Grimes
was subject to oppressive amounts
of scrutiny, from professionals and
public alike; in a since-deleted
tumblr post, she hit back: “I’m tired
of men who aren’t professional
or even accomplished musicians
continually offering to ‘help me out’
(without being asked), as if I did
this by accident”, she wrote, “I’m
tired of being considered vapid for
liking pop music.”
So perhaps the strings are a means
of Grimes asserting herself before
she’s even glimpsed; it’s a reflection
of her magpie-esque approach
to music, with a range of tastes
encompassing both Mariah Carey
and Stravinsky, without feeling
the need to posit them as polar
opposites. The message Grimes
seems to be sending out tonight is
clear: she’s done being patronised,
it’s time to break out into her own
sonic sphere.
And what a sphere it is: ebullient
with optimism, Grimes channelled
her energy into her recent LP, Art
Angels, an album that manages to
be dizzyingly complex and off-piste,
but still has killer hooks, perfect for
screaming along to. A majority of
the songs have been adapted for the
live performance, adding to their
intensity: Art Angels highlight ‘Flesh
Without Blood’ ends with a drum
machine breakdown, going out with
a bang; ‘Venus Fly’, her duet with
Janelle Monaé, is ratcheted up to
the nth degree,dragging contrasting
Brixton are lapping it up.
AtherlastLondongig,waybackin
2012, my friend said that watching
Grimes was like “watching an
infant play with Fisher-Price toys”.
Uncharitable, perhaps, but there is
a modicum of truth in it: like all
artists heavily reliant on computers
and synthesisers, it is difficult for
Grimes to do much more than
sway in the centre of the stage,
surrounded by a myriad of flashing
buttons and knobs. But she’s come a
long way since then, bringing along
two ninja-like dancers, who twirl
ribbons and at one point switch to
pairs of sharp blades, accentuating
the music. In a nice touch, backing
vocals are provided by the support
act HANA, an American artist
whose music is well produced,
but a tad familiar, resembling a
smoothed over version of Purity
Ring, or a less upbeat Chvrches;
like Grimes, she uses a high register,
and at points in the gig their voices
become indistinguishable. Despite
having to repeatedly leap back to
her central command station of
laptops and keyboards, Grimes
manages to spend most of the gig
prowling around the stage, jumping
and caterwauling like an escaped
hyena in an astonishing display of
vigour.
However, such action can only
be maintained for so long, and at
points the overwhelming energy of
the songs collapses into a general
cacophony; this is not at all helped
by the dodgy sound mixing, which
elevates the bass above all other
sounds in the room, resulting too
often in a sludgy mess. Taiwanese
rapper Aristophanes isn’t available
to perform her part on ‘Scream’, so
Grimes takes over, offering to rap
in Russian; unfortunately, what had
been pinpointed Mandarin bars on
the album,spat out like poison darts,
becomes completely indecipherable
– a clutter of shouting and wailing.
Since Visions, made on a copy of
Apple’s GargeBand, Grimes has
relentlessly expanded her musical
vocabulary, teaching herself the
guitar, ukulele, drums, and violin in
preparation for Art Angels’precisely-
produced tidal wave of sound. With
this vast armoury, she has begun the
process of rearranging the songs
alone in her bedroom, was reaching
out across the sonic divide to each
individual listener. Reinterpreting
the songs for the Brixton audience,
however, has robbed them of this
magical power.
But there are gems here too:
Grimes has had the good sense to
not mess with the classics too much.
‘Genesis’ and ‘Oblivion’, the two
most popular tracks from Visions,
have been preserved pretty much
intact, much to the delight of the
cheering audience. In her scatter-
brained, eclectically chatty manner,
she tells the audience that she
doesn’t like the process of going off
and back on for an encore, and will
just play it straight away instead.
In her last song, ‘Kill V Maim’, the
heady bass proves no match for
the electrified audience, chanting
away with the evil-cheerleader
style chorus, and the gig ends on a
triumphant note.
The concert at Brixton seems
to mark Grimes out as being at
a junction: the gap between the
impressionistic subtleties of Visions,
and the bombastic maximalism
of Art Angels is a difficult one to
straddle. When things all come
together, it’s like she’s riding a
wave of dynamism, buoyed on by
the audience; but the dodgy sound
mixing, and the insistence on
contorting old material to fit her
present sound does her no favours.
Brixton was a statement of intent:
Grimes has moved on from her old
material, and is ready to set off on a
new bombastic course. Who knows
what the destination will be; but the
journey will sure be interesting.

build-up to ricochet into a ground-
shattering climax; and she opts
for the album version of ‘Realiti’

drums with more kick – fans may

from Visions, allowing them to fit in
better with her new direction.But all
translators are traitors,and by trying
to fit the minimalist structures of her
earlier songs around the framework
of her newer stuff, she stretches the
material too thin. Songs like ‘Be a
Body’and ‘Symphonia IX (My Wait
is U)’ have been distorted beyond
belief, their bass-lines subsuming
Grimes’ vocals, which have dropped
an octave or two.The magic of these
songs was their intimacy: Grimes,
