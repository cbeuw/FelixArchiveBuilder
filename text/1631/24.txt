This week you love how
many people applied for
President – it just goes to
show how well everyone has
done this year in encouraging
other people to participate in
their union, and keep up the
excellent work of our current
leaders.

This week your girlfriend
finally takes you back after all
the horoscopes jokes about
having sex with her mum
on the condition you don’t
mention having sex with her
mum. Like those other times,
you had dreams about having
sex with her mum.
This week, your Jupiter is
ascending your retrograded
Mercury. Ouch!
This week, in an attempt to
win over voters you recruited
rap legend Nas of Illmatic
fame; however, he wins way
more votes than you and
subsequently becomes Union
President.
This week you are dead on the
inside from Imperial. All you
want to do is gorge on easter
eggs and cry about how you
hate science and how you’re
trying to convince yourself
that consulting is actually
interesting.
This week, you realise that
university is way more work
than you had ever anticipated.
I mean you haven't even had
a Snakebite in two hours.
This week, you're one of the
air pollution sensor-wearing
pigeons, forced to tweet
levels of particulates against
your will.Your following sky-
rockets when you start taking
tweeted requests to shit on
people, but Mother Earth
perishes without the pigeons
to save it.
This week you are glad that
the union elections are
finally over so that you can
get back to masturbating
furiously over the blue
triangles the union thinks
are cool. Mmmm, that sweet
tessellation.
This week you find it amazing
that so many candidates
applied for a Presidential post
that receives a £19,000 salary
– although to be fair Alice
Gast gets paid over £400,000
and she doesn't even have to
put up with union council's
shit.
This week you are
disappointed that Cale did
not win FELIX Editor,
especially since you invested
so heavily in the green leafy
vegetable industry. Also Lef
hates the horoscopes so don’t
trust him.
This week, you are running
for Union President and are
asked to appear on a radio
show. However, you are too
afraid of not living up to the
entertainment value provided
by this year's candidates and
withdraw an hour before
you're supposed to go on air.
This week after Marco
Rubio was forced to drop
out of the US presidential
race, he decides to run for
Deputy President (Finance
and Services); however, he
loses to RON and so decides
to do a masters in Science
Communication.
