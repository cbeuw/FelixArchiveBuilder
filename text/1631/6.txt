My fight for DPCS
Winning a new perspective on the position, Imperial, and comfort zones

T
his year I ran for DPCS
in the Union Elections,
and here's the story of
my campaign.
First of all, I’d like to thank
everyone who took the time to vote
for me and spread the word around.
I really do appreciate it, and despite
losing by quite a bit in the end,
looking back, I’m really happy that
we managed to get as far as we did.
Why? Because before these
elections, I was a lurker. I’d gotten
involved in a few societies, but I was
essentially a nobody in the wider
world of Imperial. If you heard my
name or saw my face, it probably
wouldn’t mean anything to you
unless you took a class or played
hockey with me.
So why did I run? In a chance
encounter one evening, at a Guitar
Soc Open Mic Night,the wonderful
Chris Kaye bought us a round of
drinks.This was such a lovely gesture
that I went over to thank him, and
ended up showing him a few magic
tricks. Long story short, he’d drunk
enough at that point to think that I
would have made a good sabb.
I was sceptical because of my lack
of experience, but interested, so I
talked to Ben, the current DPCS.
He told me that no matter how
much experience you think you
have, you’re never ready for the
actual job.
So with the knowledge that
anyone who got the job would
struggle no matter how much more
they’d been involved, I decided that
I’d give the campaign a go.
I’ll be honest, and admit that
half of my motive at this point was
to use the campaign to get some
publicity for Magic Society, and the
other half was that I didn’t feel like
getting a real job at the end of the
year.
We prepared our campaign, and
I think we did a pretty good job. I
finally used up some of the printer
credits that the College has been
chucking at us for four years, and
pasted my face all around campus in
the hope that people might possibly
notice.
When the polls opened, however,
something strange happened. As
I walked around, brandishing a
giant picture of myself on the end
of a hockey stick, giving sweets to
strangers and performing magic
tricks in an attempt to get them to
listen to my pitch, I started hearing
real stories from the students
who ran into problems running
their clubs. Be it room bookings
or budgets, it was clear that the
world of clubs and socs at Imperial
had fixable issues, and I started to
actually want the job. I realised that
it’s a position where you can make a
difference to a lot of people,and that
it would be a great opportunity to
meet and help out some genuinely
cool people.
So I campaigned a lot harder than
I thought I would. I fought through
the many straight rejections from
students that were completely
uninterested, talked to a tonne of
people, and honestly enjoyed the
experience of seeing what people
thought of the uni we all study at.
Meeting the other candidates was
just great too: I realised that it was
a mistake to lurk like I did for three
years when there are so many cool
people to meet if you just look a
little harder.
I went into the results party,
wanting the role for completely
different reasons from before I
started campaigning, and genuinely
hoping to win despite the odds.
In the end, I lost by quite a large
margin, and at the time I was pretty
surprised and disappointed.
I was quite angry too, as the other
candidates didn’t show up to the
results party.How did I lose to a guy
who doesn’t even care enough to see
the results with his competitors?
Looking back,I was never going to
win. There’s no way that two weeks
alone can get you from pretty much
unknown to the winner of what is
essentially a popularity contest, and
I’m glad I got out of my little bubble
to meet some great people I would
never have had any contact with
otherwise.
If there’s a moral of the story, it’s
that if you’re a natural lurker like
me, you should try to get involved
even if it’s outside your comfort
zone. This applies especially if you
have any inkling towards running
for a position in the future, because
in reality a campaign starts years
before the elections begin,when you
meet people and start building your
influence.
I hope I don’t sound too bitter
I realised
that it was
a mistake
to lurk like I
did for three
years
Try to get
involved
even if it’s
outside your
comfort
zone
about my loss. I truly wish James,
next year’s DPCS, the best of luck.
From the look of things, it’s a
position that feels like you’re on a
treadmill that always moves twice
as fast as you can run. With over
300 clubs at Imperial, it likely feels
more like a vertical climb than an
uphill battle, but I still would’ve
loved to have given it a go. I’ll buy
you a much deserved pint when I
swing back around the Union! And
please be nice to my Magic Society?
It wouldn’t be the same at Imperial
without the small niche societies, so
I hope you give them the attention
they need too.
