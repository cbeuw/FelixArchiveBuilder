FILM
H
igh-Rise is the kind of
film throughout the
majority of which you
don’t know whether to
laugh or cry. Most dystopian films
can be tough to stomach at the best
of times – surely half the point of
cinema is to escape into a world
that’s not quite as screwed up as this
one is? – but there are those that
add enough humour to make it all
go down a bit more sweetly. While
some of these films, like Terry
Gilliam’s 1985 masterpiece Brazil,
go down a slightly more light-
hearted (but still ultimately soul-
crushing) slapstick route, High-Rise
achieves this through a much more
Clockwork Orange-based approach:
acts of gasp-inducing depravity and
violence are played out in such a
ridiculous manner that they pile up,
eventually intertwining into a web
of grisly hilarity.
The high-rise in question is a
brand new block of luxury flats,
complete with supermarket,
recreational grounds, and an
apparently close-knit community
into which Dr Robert Laing –
played by the master of finding new
ways to be simultaneously slippery
and charming, Tom Hiddleston –
has just moved. The time and place
is said to be London, 1975, but an
eerie sheen to the glaring pastel-
bathed imagery makes the film feel
like it’s set in some curiously robotic
parallel world (although I’m not all
that well versed in history – maybe
everything just looked like that in
the seventies). All seems well at
first: isolated from the trials and
tribulations of everyday society,
the residents have built their own
thriving network of livelihoods, and
Laing settles into a pleasant routine,
managing to make some friends
across the floors – even the architect,
Royal (an excellently steely Jeremy
Irons), seems to have taken a liking
to him. But it soon becomes clear
that all floors are not created equal:

The interest
in High-
Rise comes
in the way
the class-
system
clash plays
out
A marriage of reason and nightmare
Ben Wheatley aims high in his take on a towering icon of modern British fiction
and those up above soon have to
face the wrath of those down below.
The clash that ensues bears, on
paper at least,many of the hallmarks
of the class-system satire that you’d
expect to follow such a setup – but
where High-Rise’s interest as a film
comes is the way in which the clash
plays out. Violence quickly erupts,
naturally, at a party held by the
lower floors when an intrusion is
made by a henchman of the uppers,
but immediately after this the moral
conduct of both parties decays
exponentially; a short montage of
increasingly disgruntled neighbours
suddenly debilitates into people
screaming and running past fires
in a corridor halfway through
the film, and we’re suddenly in a
documentary about tribal warfare
– one curiously under-stocked with
actual wilderness and over-stocked
with jewellery, suits, and ties.
The descent is a fast and jarring
one; I wonder perhaps too fast,
but then again that may have
been director Ben Wheatley’s
intended effect – I imagine societal
spirals into madness have a way of
sneaking up on you, as many things
seem to in this busy world. One of
the strongest and funniest aspects
of the film is that it manages to
maintain its sense of ‘Britishness’
come rain or shine, even at its most
jaw-dropping. A frontrunner for
the movie’s best scene depicts Laing
in an extended, brutal wrestling
match with a fellow supermarket
patron over the last tin of royal blue
on the shelf, which ends with him
hurriedly rising, dusting himself off,
and in an exasperated, apologetic
tone explaining to his victim: “It’s
my paint”.
I find it very easy a lot of the
time to take the piss out of
Tom Hiddleston for the overly-
captivating villainous/anti-heroic
Brit niche he’s carved for himself in
the film industry, but to his massive
credit, I have never seen him fail
to rise to the occasion with a good
performance. High-Rise is certainly
no exception – he has a magnetism
to him that sucks you in right from
the off, and as the chaos unfolds
around him, the nuance he brings
to the character of Dr. Laing makes
you wonder if he’s the victim of his
circumstance or if he was in fact as
mad as the other residents all along,
just waiting for the opportunity
to spread his wings. He meets his
match in the form of Luke Evans
– one of the most underrated screen
presences working in mainstream
cinema today – as Richard Wilder,
the hot-headed filmmaker turned
revolutionary who spearheads the
rioting of the lower floors. Sienna
Miller also turns in a strong
performance as the sultry,apparently
all-knowing Charlotte Melville.
The film may not quite meet
the high standard set by its source
material (the J.G. Ballard novel
of the same name), but High-
Rise offers a riotously anarchic,
kaleidoscopic look at the depths of
depravity human society can sink
into if unchecked. Wheatley doesn’t
set himself an easy task, attempting
to replicate a novel with one of
literature’s greatest lesser-known
opening lines: the film can’t quite
beat that double-take feeling when
you first read,“Later, as he sat on his
balcony eating the dog…”
The top three
Murder
Mysteries
that aren’t
Rear Window
O
k, so the original plan
for this week was to put
together an election-
themed section. Maybe
‘best films featuring presidents’ or
‘best political dramas’? The truth
of it is that I’m a bit election’d out
right now…Either that or I couldn’t
find anything on Google other than
Lincoln. You know what’s more
exciting than student elections
though? Murder. Hitchcock’s Rear
Window may be the best but it’s not
the be-all-and-end-all:
Memento (2000)
Christopher Nolan’s breakout
feature Memento still stands up
today as one of the most intelligent
and intricate films ever. It focuses
on Leonard Shelby, a man who is
hunting for his wife’s murderer.
What’s unique is that Leonard can
only form short term memories.
Because of this, Memento is told
backwards, with X minutes of his
life being told followed by a skip
back in time. Makes sense? No? I
swear it’s not as hard as it sounds.
Se7en (1995)
Seven (or ‘Se7en’ as it sometimes
weirdly stylised) is easily one of the
most critically acclaimed films in
the genre. A modern-day classic,
Seven tells the story of the hunt for
a serial killer who uses the seven
deadly sins as his modus operandi.
There are endless twists and turns
as well as stellar performances by
Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and, in
particular, Kevin Spacey.
Who Framed Roger
Rabbit? (1988)
Don’t even challenge me on
this. Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
is a flawless, loving spoof of the
noir genre. Bob Haskins is a
perfect leading man and had the
incredibly hard job of interacting
with characters who weren’t actually
there. This is something which also
made the film quite revolutionary.
Also, was I the only person scarred
by ‘the Toon’ as a kid? I doubt I
could sit through the ending even
now.

T
he concept of the witch
is an ancient one. Present
since time immemorial,
examples of witchcraft
can be found all across the globe,
from the Maori people’s belief in
makutu, to the kitsune-tsukai of
Japan. Even today, witches play a
prominentroleinsociety:justlookat
the phrase ‘Ditch the Witch’, used a
few years ago by supporters of Tony
Abbott against the then-incumbent
Australian PM Julia Gillard. The
witch has come to stand for a fear
of female agency and power, and
nowhere is this more apparent than
in Robert Eggers’ directorial debut,
The Witch, a slow-burning horror
that creeps into your subconscious
like tendrils of mist.
We begin with the
excommunication of a family in
New England, half a century before
the infamous Salem witch trials.
Leaving the commonwealth, they
must strike out on their own in an
inhospitable state of nature, finding
a plot adjacent to a thick forest
upon which they can found a new
society. Things only go downhill
from here. The eldest daughter of
the clan, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-
Joy), is watching her baby brother
Samuel, when he vanishes before
her very eyes. As time goes on,
despite her mother Katherine’s
(Kate Dickie) repeated cries to God,
the crops begin to fail, their goats
start expressing blood instead of
milk, and eldest son Caleb is cursed.
Faced with this brutal barrage of
calculated misfortune from the
outside the family turns inwards,
on Thomasin, whose burgeoning
sensuality represents a threat to the
security of the community.
Building on years of painstaking
research, The Witch is nothing if not
authentic. With moon and candle-
light often being the only source
of illumination, the entire film is
drenched in an oppressive darkness,
highlighting the dichotomous
beauty and power of the natural
world. Most of the dialogue, we
are told, is lifted verbatim from
recordings of the era.This,combined
with the excellent Yorkshire accents
from the cast,call to mind the power
of Clio Barnard’s debut feature, The
Arbor, which shares the haunting
sense of the dead being brought
back to life. The cast are excellent
throughout: Taylor-Joy provides
the right notes of vulnerability, as
she treads the tightrope from girl
to woman; and Ralph Ineson is
ferocious as patriarch William, his
deep voice making it sound like he’s
being chewing gravel. But top prize
goes to Dickie, her Katherine is a
woman struggling with the weight
of the world, but refuses to break, all
sinew and tension and deep grief.
Completely unreliant on jump-
scares, Eggers’ film is a cut above
other horrors, and its impression
lingers long after the credits roll.
While the introduction of an actual
witch early on in the film may be
seen by some as putting the horse
before the cart, Eggers’ decision
actually works in his favour. It
In London, it’s rare to properly
know your neighbours. And with
the release of The Ones Below, it
seems one has even less of a reason
to pop round for tea and biscuits.
Kate (Clémence Poésy) and Jon
(David Morrissey) are a settled
couple, expectant with their first
child, living in a spacious apartment
in a London terrace. Their
downstairs flat, following the death
of its owner, is taken over by Justin
(Stephen Campbell Moore) and
Teresa (Laura Birn),another couple,
who are also expecting. Kate and
Jon invite the other couple over for
dinner,but as the evening progresses,
tensions build in the apartment,
culminating in a tragic incident that
kick-starts a wave of psychological
torture for Kate. What follows is a
chilling game of cat-and-mouse,
one that reveals the mental isolation
that can be faced by a new mother,
and critiques a system that treats
women as hysterical.
And yet perhaps this film is better
read as an exploration of class
differences, and how the economic
can spill over into the personal.
Kate and Jon are icons of millennial
modernity, their flat all artfully
stripped down wooden flooring. In
contrast, the flat below is all shiny
surfaces and primary colours. At
times, this spills over into heavy-
handedness, such as when Kate
looks out of the window of her
dull flat to see Teresa lounging in
the sun-dappled, John Waters-
esque garden, like a plasticky extra
in a pop video. But director David
Farr throws in subtler hints along
the way: Kate works at the V&A,
while Justin’s investments mean
Teresa never needs to work again;
the age-difference between the
downstairs couple creates a palpable
note of suspicion with Kate and
Jon; and Teresa’s gift of a gender-
colour-coordinated sailor’s outfit
for the baby clashes with Kate’s
penchant for muted tones. In
short, the tension between the two
couples may be a result, not of any
psychological disturbance, but from
the tensions of the class system.
At least, that’s my take on it,
and lord knows this film needs it,
otherwise it’s nothing more than an
adequate re-tread of innumerable
paranoia-dramas, namely Polanski’s
Rosemary’s Baby. There are tropes in
The Ones Below that have become
deeply ingrained in the thriller
genre – you can see them coming
a mile off – and it would have
been much more effective if the
film avoided them full-stop. We
end with a conclusion that leaves
no doubt about what happened
in the viewer’s mind, erasing any
semblance of ambiguity created in
the preceding 80 minutes. Those
looking for a fresh take on the
topic of female hysteria should
look elsewhere. The Ones Below is
a competently directed take on a
well-trodden topic; a Polanski for
the hipster generation.
FRED FYLES
allows us to focus on the real enemy:
man himself, and the psychological
paranoia that comes when faced
with the barbarity of the natural
world. Having made a break with
nature man can never truly return to
it, creating a delicious tension at the
heart of The Witch. The real witches,
it begins to dawn, were inside of us
all along.
