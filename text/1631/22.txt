W
e all know that
feeling. The
moment of closure
as something
wonderful comes to an end. You
look back and realise that it will stay
with you for many years to come, as
a glowing memory in your life. This
year’s weekend away has been one
of those moments for us!
On the Friday evening a group
of tired Imperial students gathered
around a blue minibus, chatting
amiably, with a quiet buzz of
excitement permeating the air.
Waking up bright and early on
Saturday at 8.30, breakfast was an
assortment of brioche, croissants,
muesli,fruit yoghurt and the various
permutations there-of.Whilst every
one broke their fast Sophie began,
what would become, her famous
‘Sing Along with Sophie’ routine,
consisting of a series of repetitive,
catchy tunes that were designed to
irritate you for weeks to come.
Once we were all suitably
warmed up we dived straight into
Sea Sketches by Grace Williams.
Honestly, this is an incredible
piece and unmissable for any fans
of program music out there. It was
composed by a woman (sadly a
rarity among famous composers)
from Wales in 1944 for string
orchestra.
Every club or society has that
weird game they play like ‘the
pairs game’ or the ‘peg’ game. Well,
ICSE kicked off the incomparable
‘which vegetable am I’game.Players
would pose as they depicted a
vegetable using only their body, and
particularly, their facial expression.
Results were mixed but Samuel’s
celery was especially admirable!
As the full light of Sunday
bloomed, ICSE members struggled
out of sleeping bags and into
breakfast.This time a more subdued
affair,albeit with the singing entirely
intact.
Arriving at the church we were
pleased to find it both heated AND
with toilets, which was a marked
improvement on the year before.
The concert as a whole was very
well played with solid performances
in both the Sea Sketches and the
Brandenburg, so well in fact that we
did an encore of Sailing song from
the Sea Sketches; the last of the

Imperial College String Ensemble
ICSE fills us in on their weekend away
three we performed.
Pulling into the union around
6-7pm we unloaded, unpacked,
parked the bus and decided it was
time to go home. Right proper job
all round. The weekend was over,
and as we contemplated the week
ahead, we could feel that this had
been a time we would remember for
years to come and look back on with
great fondness and affection. Thank
you ICSE for making this possible.
If you are interested in coming
and listening to ICSE, all FELIX
readers are very welcome to come
to our Spring concert on Friday
the 18th
of March at 19:30 in Holy
Trinity Church, South Kensington.
We hope to see you there!

Ending term on a high note (or several!)
It's officially performance season again for the arts societies at Imperial
A
fter the all round success
seen at ArtsFest last term
for the Arts societies
Imperial has seen them
come roaring back to life for a series
of incredible Easter term concerts.
ICSM Drama put on a wonderful
performance of Midsummer Night’s
dream in the Union Concert Hall
last week with snazzy costumes, set
and performances. The PhotoSoc
exhibition has been up in the Blythe
gallery since the launch last week
and it’s pretty incredible. The free
wine and cheese at the launch was
also pretty incredible, if we’re being
completey honest.
As we’ve already seen in FELIX
C&S, there’s the Dance Imperial
show coming up this weekend
(17th

to be a phenomenal six dance

weekend we have the ICSE concert
(mentioned above), Imperial’s Got
Talent (20th
March, Great Hall),
and IC DramSoc’s Big Fellah (20th
& 21st
March, MR3). It’s going to
be a big weekend of big talent!
Also coming up soon is the
Imperial College Chamber Choir
concert ‘Sacré et Profane’ in the
Holy Trinity Church (22nd
March)
and ICSM Light Opera’s 24 (30th
April) where the cast start learning
