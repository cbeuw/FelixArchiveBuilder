SEX
I had sex in the tunnels under Imperial
We sent a lot of snapchats

I
t was a bright, sunny day
in the summer of 2014.
The renovation of the West
Basement of Beit was well
underway, and amidst the flurry
of activity, I discovered some stairs
hidden deep in the archives, which
lead down to a dusty crawlspace,
leading to the tunnels.
Knowing that this entrance
would be sealed off as part of the
renovation, and knowing that
there weren’t many people likely
to come looking around that day,
opportunities were seized, and sure
enough, I found myself a partner
and went exploring. In anticipation
of the decades of dust, we stole
abandoned TEDxAlbertopolis
t-shirts, barricaded the door, and
crept down the stairs.
After crawling a few feet, it was
pitch black; an absolute disorienting
darkness where you couldn’t see
your hand in front of your face. We
decided not to press any further
after we discovered that the tunnel
was partially collapsed, given that
no one knew our location beyond
the Snapchats we left as clues.
The ceiling was low, the floor was
rough. Heads were banged, and
knees were scraped. The confined
space and total darkness heightened
all senses, making it one of the
most uncomfortable, intense sexual
encounters I’ve experienced.
Dust-ruined stolen t-shirts
abandoned in the tunnel (where they
will for evermore lay), we emerged
blinking into the brightness of Beit
Quad, our lungs thirsty for air that
had not been undisturbed for years.
We were tracked down in the bar,
half covered in dust, by disbelieving
friends who had followed our
disappearing photographic
breadcrumbs.
Was it worth it? Absolutely.
Between the unexpectedly
pleasurable rendezvous, and having
an unbeatable story to tell at parties,
this experience has served me well.
Would I recommend it? Well, if

A letter to...the man who broke my heart
I thought it should end the way it started, with an inappropriate article in FELIX

you can find any more entrances,
and you want to risk finding out
whether or not the rumours are true
that you’ll be expelled from College
if you’re caught in the tunnels,
absolutely go for it. But watch out
for the dust. You’ll be finding it in
strange places for weeks.
I
learnt so much from you.
You taught me how to love
like I’ve never loved before.
You taught me how to cry
more than I’ve ever cried before.You
taught me how to voice my opinions,
to argue,to debate.You taught me to
be a feminist, even though you call
yourself anything but. You taught
me to strive to make other people
see how brightly I shine.
What you didn’t teach me was
how to not take crap from guys
like you again. You crept into my
life, condemning the abuses of my
past, whilst carelessly treating me
the same. You helped me to be open
and honest about each and every
emotion, without ever reflecting for
a moment on yours. I basked in your
privilege and boldness, empowered
by your strength and directness. But
under the veneer of truthfulness,you
withdrew into lies, changing from
a man I thought was beautiful, to
someone so capable of such cruelty.
You taught me that relationships
aren’t easy; I’ve never worked as hard
as I did when I tried to understand
you. But after all of that, when it
came to it, you didn’t want to put in
the work.You showed me that those
who seem giving can be selfish,
those who seem well-mannered
can be disrespectful, and those who
seem the warmest can be the most
cold.
You poured your early impression
of my personality into a cast
projected from your dysfunctional
relationships, and your insecurities
made you ashamed of the false
impression that came out of the
mould. You taught me to convince
myself that I was at fault, to swallow
my tears and pretend you didn’t
hurt me. With you, I put up with
more than I ever thought possible.
I learnt to adjust my expectations,
and to augment my aspirations and
dreams. I convinced myself that I
wanted what you wanted.
After all of this, I think that
perhaps my raw emotion isn’t
something that you can understand.
In a testament to how much I
tried, my heartbreak was painfully
My
heartbreak
was
painfully
recorded in
the data of
my Fitbit
recorded in the data of my Fitbit.
You told me that I was oppressing
you, but you were wrong. You don’t
know how to be happy, only to
pretend. I thought I was bathing
in your phosphorescence, inspired
and illuminated by you. But I was
wrong.
In the beginning, you were so
encouraging and uplifting, but in
the end you were pulling me down.
