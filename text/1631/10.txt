P
rofessor Joanna Haigh is
one of Imperial’s leading
scientists. In 2009, she
became the first woman
to become Head of the Physics
Department. As she’s eager to say
herself, “It’s a great department and
a lot of fantastic science is going on
here.”
Recently she’s become co-director
of Imperial’s Grantham Institute
where she invests resources in
people, workshops and students, as
well as informs the Government
about science. Haigh is additionally
a Fellow of the Royal Society and
in 2013 was appointed a CBE, both
great honours.
Haigh’s reputation further
demonstrates her importance at
Imperial and for women in STEM
striving for academic recognition.
Her advice to women: “if you’re
interested then just go for it, don’t
be put off.”
Currently, her research involves
measuring how changes in the
Sun’s ultraviolet (UV) radiation
affects our planet’s climate. Most
of the radiation is absorbed by the
stratosphere.
However novel research has been
investigating how UV radiation
might influence the atmosphere
below. So, Haigh has been focusing
on how the changes in the
stratospherecanaffecttheweatherat
the surface. She studies the changes
in the momentum driving the
winds in the stratosphere and how

that compares to the atmospheric
circulations below. Haigh’s results
suggest that when the Sun is more
active, the storm tracks (high speed
winds pulling the storms across the
Atlantic) move slightly closer to the
poles, whereas when the sun is less
active, they tend to move slightly
closer to the equator.
This suggests that middle latitude
areas where storm tracks appear,
experience the effect the strongest.
So, when the sun is less active,
you’re more likely to get a colder
winter. Therefore, the UK’s climate
experiences small but significant
effects from the solar cycle.
As put by Haigh, this research
“helps us understand what natural
factors are influencing the climates
that are separate from human
factors.” Professor Joanna Haigh. Photo Credit: Natasha Khaleeq

Science, what’s good?
Stripping away stardust, 7,800
light years away, v404 Cygni is a
black hole that still manages to
dazzle astronomers, by flashing
violent red in displays of destructive
power, as material from an orbiting
star is devoured. These red light
flashes are, well, just that – flashes
that last a fraction of a second, as
matter spurs from the black hole.
V404 Cygni was the first black
hole to be identified in our galaxy,
but from June 2015 onwards, the
black hole brightened in dramatic
sporadic bursts, providing new
insights into the formation of such
jets and the working of black holes.
Lead author Dr Poshak Gandhi,
Associate Professor and STFC
Ernest Rutherford fellow at the
University of Southampton explains
“the high speed tells us that the
region where this red light is being
emitted must be very compact.
Piecing together clues about the
colour, speed and the power of these
flashes,we conclude that this light is
being emitted from the base of the
black hole jet”. Black holes just got
a little bit brighter.

Imagine a world absent of oxygen.
Suffocating,no? Until about 3.5-3.8
billion years ago, our fossil records
indicates that photosynthesis was a
process which simply did not exist.
A reaction,which now seems simple;
a process taking sugar and water,
using the sun's energy to produce
oxygen. Scientists pinpointed this
revolution, responsible for a great
leap in terms of species quantity and
diversity, to the basking bacteria of
Morning Glory Pool, Yellowstone
National Park. These bacteria use a
primitive form of photosynthesis,
one which does not produce oxygen,
and were till recently thought by
scientists to be the first life forms
which did so. However, study
author Dr Tanai Cardona, from
the Department of Life Sciences at
Imperial College London, claims
that “the picture that is starting to
emerge is that during the first half
of Earth’s history, the majority of
life forms were probably capable of
photosynthesis”. Photosynthesis is
likely to have occurred in bacterial
species, before those around today.

Breast milk or
bottle?
As the number of mums seeking
alternatives to natural breastfeeding
increases, the demand for artificial
infant milk sources similarly rises.
Scientists are put under more and
more pressure to develop a formula
which can measure up to the natural
stuff. It is widely known that breast-
fedinfantsshowreducedeczemaand
allergy risk compared to those fed by
bottle. However, many studies have
claimed hydrolysed milk formulas
help reduce the mitigating impacts
of bottle feeding, closing the health
benefit gap between milk from the
breast compared to milk from the
bottle. To further investigate these
claims, a recent study conducted
by the Department of Medicine at
Imperial College London, analysed
19,000 participants, and found
no evidence supporting them.
Publication bias is thought to have
previously found this supposed link
between the hydrolysed formula and
a reduced infant risk to eczema and
allergies. Once again the scientific
community has come under scrutiny.

echanically patching
up a ‘broken’ heart
may soon be possible
thanks to Tal
Dvir and Ron Feiner. They have
integrated electronics with living
tissues to produce the “cyborg
heart patch”. The patch acts like an
organ, but is powered by a machine,
regulating heart contraction and
expansion. With 25% of patients
on the US waiting list dying before
getting a heart transplant, this
medicinal technological revolution
has the potential to save millions of
lives, as the patch can replace any
damaged heart tissue. In addition,
the patch enables real-time
monitoring of the patient's heart
rate, and can intervene to modify
heart pace and activate regenerative
drugs if required from afar. Practical
implications of the technology,
however, may take some time.

Turns out humans are not the
only junk food lovers. Scientists at
the University of East Anglia have
observed a complete behavioural
change in storks brought about by
human activity, and the momentous
amount of waste that we produce.
Storks have thrown in the towel for
maintaining their active lifestyle.
The Europe to Africa winter annual
trip is proving to be too much of an
effort. Lounging around on landfill
sites, gauging on leftover bargain
buckets does seem like a good
compromise. However this lifestyle
is very temperamental, with new
EU directives scheduled to turn
such landfill sites to new facilities
whereby the food waste will be
handled under cover, forcing storks
from their couch potato lifestyle.
All sarcasm aside, this will cause
problems for the storks as they will
need to find an alternative winter
food supply; a problem which
will affect chick fledging success,
migratory decisions, breeding
locations and stork distributions.
