USB Nightmare!
Losing your data could be a horror story. Avoid storing
information on USB drives and external hard drives as they
can be lost, stolen or infected by viruses.
What to do:
• Use College’s recommended file storage to save information
(H: drive, group space, OneDrive for Business)
• If you must use a USB device, encrypt it and make sure
it’s not your only copy
• Never plug in USB devices from unknown sources
It’s everyone’s responsibility to be secure. For storage options
