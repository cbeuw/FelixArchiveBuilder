Business Schools speak of visa trouble
Matt Johnston
News Editor
A
group of business
school deans and
those responsible
for international
recruitment at 15 UK universities,
including Imperial, were
interviewed as part of a report
which concluded that current visa
rules are making study in the UK
“difficult and unattractive”.
With almost 35% of the
student body comprising of
overseas students (not including
EU countries) this is potentially
problematic for Imperial due to
the large contingent contributing
£23,000+ each per year in tuition
fees, and up to £36,000 for some
medicine courses. A decrease in this
huge chunk of income may lead to
the financial burden either having
to be taken up by home students or
through a decrease in facilities and/
or grants.
The wider economy may also
be at risk too, with the report by
CABS saying international students
studying business alone contribute
£2.4 billion to universities and the
UK economy, with its latest figures
showed that this was in decline.
Finances aside, the current visa
controls mean countries like the
US, Canada, and Australia, as
well as European countries like
Germany, are also attracting the
better students. The UK’s policies

overall quality of both research and
teaching, a cornerstone of Imperial’s
reputation.
Rankings earlier this year by the
Financial Times rankings placed

35th
best in the world and the
fourth best in the UK, a slight fall
internationally from 34th
and a
stagnation in the UK.

I
t’s time to tell us what floats
your boat within the safe
unjudging walls of the FELIX
Sex Survey.
And don’t worry, it’s totally
anonymous. You do have to
use your college username and
password to log in, but that’s just
for authentication – we just need to
make sure you go to Imperial. We
don’t save your username with your
data, so no one can identify you.
You leave your identity at the door,
so feel free to answer as truthfully
as possible and if you don’t want to
answer any of the questions, there’s
always a ‘Don’t wish to say’ option.
We’re trying to get some decent
data on you lot so have a go and
pass it on. It’s a fun five minutes
of procrastination, totally mobile
friendly, and subtly designed so
you can get away with doing it the
library cafe queue.
We’ll collate all your info at the
end and will be releasing a bumper
sex-ed(ition) of FELIX next term.
In the meantime, to get you in the
mood, we’re releasing a tonne of sex
and relationship themed content
over the next few weeks. You can
find it in this issue on page eight.
Hear at FELIX, we love a good
sex story. You once gave head in
a shopping trolley? Great. You’re
taking your first steps into banging
as a trans person? Fantastic. You
had sex in the maze of tunnels that
run beneath our university? Tell us
more!
If you fancy contributing,
anonymously if need be, pop us an
email at felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You can take the survey now at
