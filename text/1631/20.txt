The future of Netflix
N
etflix recently has
rolled out measures
to ban people from
using proxies to access
their service. What this means
for the service’s customers is that
you are effectively confined to
watching what is available in your
own country. This is an issue for
subscribers basically anywhere
except the US where the catalogue
of available material is vastly
superior. It remains to be seen,
however, whether this was the right
decision for them. Immediately
after the announcement, there
was the expected internet outrage
with people saying this move was
ludicrous and that they would be
cancelling their subscriptions. This,
of course, quickly subsided. But
the issue at the heart of the dissent
remains; is it still worth having a
Netflix subscription?
Netflix topped the end of 2015
with almost 75 million subscribers,
dwarfing its rivals, Amazon
Prime and Hulu Plus. One could
easily, however, expect a drop
in subscriptions after effectively
offering less for every customer.
This move came as the result
of increasing pressure from the
traditional TV companies (mainly
in the US) that have been trying to
effect of so many more streaming
services opening, with exclusivity
contracts.With this diluting what is
available on each, and making each
of them a lesser value for money, it
could be that we are reaching the
end of a golden age on television
streaming where so much was
available at such low cost.
Netflix’s pre-emptive response
to this has been to funnel huge
amounts of money into their
original programming, with
their Chief Content Officer Ted
Sarandos claiming that they’re
“releasing more shows in the next
quarter than many networks will
in a whole year”. 2015 saw their
first foray into feature length films,
with Beasts of No Nation and Adam
Sandler’s Ridiculous 6 as well as
going into more traditional, family
stifle Netflix’s growing popularity
by restricting its access to many of
their shows. HBO has notably been
doing this, now offering its own
streaming service HBOGo in direct
competition. However, it remains
only available in the US, opting to
instead sell their library of shows to
international broadcasters: to Sky in
the case of the UK.There is also the
to finesse their way into the Marvel
Cinematic Universe with the
critically acclaimed Daredevil and
Jessica Jones, with at least three more
related series to follow in the next
few years. It is clear that, as the only
shows guaranteed to be available
worldwide on their service, this
growing library of originals will be
vital to their success going forward.
It is therefore likely no coincidence
that the proxy blocking came in so
close to the release of season four of
House of Cards and season two of
Daredevil.
While the range of content in
the UK catalogue is by no means
lacking, there are some glaring
omissions when comparing to
the American catalogue. Notably
among them, Friends, which arrived
last year in its entirety with great
fanfare. There is also a huge deficit
and lack of consistency in available
films with confusing and frustrating
choices like Kill Bill Volume 2 being
available but Volume 1 not. Despite
all this, it is my opinion that Netflix
still offers enough to justify the
£5.99 a month subscription and
those savvy enough are likely to
still be able to find a proxy that will
allow them to watch anything they
like.

and Orange is the New Black remain

Murderer spawned the biggest crop

Simpson trial and they’ve managed

A
iring for only two
seasons, The Spectacular
Spider-Man animated
series is one of the
numerous shows cancelled before its
time. With characterisation true to
the spirit of the comics, intelligent
storytelling, and superb action, this
is one of the greatest portrayals of
everyone’s favorite wall-crawling
superhero and the strongest in any
medium outside of comic books.
This is the type of series that proves
both the strength of the character
of Spider-Man and the unique
strengths of animated series in the
realm of superheroes.
Created by Greg Weisman and
Victor Cook, this is a series that
nails what’s special about Spider-
Man and his world. As a whole,
The Spectacular Spider-Man
draws its influences from the early
comics. This was when the hero
was introduced and focused heavily
on his time as a student balancing
relationships, school life, and being
a hero. Voiced here by Josh Keaton,
Peter really feels like the character
has jumped straight from the
comics and is swinging across your
screen in animated form. He has all
of his strengths, weaknesses, charm,
and depth, which makes him an
endearing character to all viewers.
The lasting appeal of Spider-
Man is based upon the character’s
relatability and inspirational
qualities. Peter Parker has ups and
downs in his personal, professional,
and superhero lives, with many
of his struggles based in the same
issues that affect his viewers or
readers. At the same time, he’s still
a good person, trying desperately to
live up to the ideals set by his late
uncle.
All of those elements are alive and
well here in The Spectacular Spider-
Man.The team behind the show not
onlycraftscompellingstoriesinboth
the superhero and personal sides of
Peter’s life, but also combines them
to make a cohesive narrative that
excites and even frustrates in the
best ways.As a result,this makes the
series engaging and entertaining,
with nothing ever feeling dull or
superfluous. Everything is very well
balanced, which allows for a far
more thorough exploration of the
character and his supporting cast.
Despite dealing with his early
days, the show wastes no time in
telling an origin story everyone
knows. Instead, the series leaps into
action with Peter already patrolling
New York as the Wall-Crawler and
then introduces his villains one by
one. All the characters, from villains
like Doctor Octopus, to supporting
characters like Mary-Jane Watson
are given time to shine and for us
to learn what makes them tick.
Despite the large supporting cast,
each character is used in some shape
or form in a way that’s relevant to
the story.
Whiletheepisodesareforthemost
part stand-alone, they are structured
into small story arcs which all make
up a larger season-long narrative.
The sense of continuity is used well
and in a way that’s fun and rewarding
when watching from beginning to
end. There’s enough tweaks to the
standard tropes to keep the audience
surprised as well. The plotline often
moves in a completely different
direction, keeping you on your toes
and not making any ‘jump the shark’
moments. All of this is done in a
way that’s consistently fresh and
filled with energy, sincerity, and a
sense of fun.
Using a simplistic art style for the
series, The Spectacular Spider-Man
has a more youthful feel to it that
may take a while to get used to.
However, this helps to differentiate
the series and highlights the
heightened and comic book-
inspired nature of the show.The use
of bright colors and more cartoonish
features for characters helps images
to pop off the screen in a dynamic
and exciting manner. In addition,
tons of awesome fights fill the series,
with Spidey’s iconic wit, speed, and
strength on display during his many
battles. Each villain tests Spider-
Man in different ways, making for
unique and varied action scenes.
As the show goes on, it plays with
its formula more and more. An
example is an episode juxtaposed
with Shakespearean recitals whose
content reflected the main story
of Venom’s return. These breaks
from standard formulas always
worked spectacularly and helped
distinguish it from the several
straightforward superhero series
before and after it. It has the type of
smart storytelling and commitment
to a style that puts it on par with
the likes of the best superhero
series like Batman TAS. It’s a damn
shame the series got cancelled when
it did, but the frustration is well
worth the 26 episodes we got. The
Spectacular Spider-Man is simply
the quintessential show for any fans
(or potential ones) of the character.
The Spectacular Spider-Man is
available on Amazon Prime
