G
ood day campers, and
welcome to your last
issue of FELIX this
term! We’ll be back
after a short recess, which we all
thoroughly deserve.
I hope you enjoy this week’s sex-
tion. In honour of the launch of our
annual sex survey, we’ve got some
(totally safe for work) content on
sex and relationships, which will
continue until the sex survey results
come out next term.
The sex survey is a pillar of
the Imperial year, and I say that
without bias or overstatement. It
only takes five minutes, and it’s
a giggle to do even if it’s been so
long you’ve forgotten how to do it.
I won’t pretend it’s very scientific
– obviously the more sexually
natured of you are going to be more

inclined to take five minutes to
quantify your sexploits. There are
no judgemental GIFs in sight this
year, and obviously your responses
are completely anonymous. Go on,
get on it!
Even if your lurve life at Imperial
hasn’t quite lived up to your post-
A-level summer dreams, let’s not
shy away from talking about the
ridiculous things have happened
to us dating-wise. This week we
hear from people who have banged
below the corridors of the university
in the not-so-secret tunnels
beneath us, but we also hear from
the heartbroken, a virgin and talk
contraception with students who
have been there, done that.
If you have a story, let us know.
There’s nothing more cathartic
than over-sharing intimate details
