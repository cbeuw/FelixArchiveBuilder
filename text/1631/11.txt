n modern times, the peer-
reviewed publication is seen
as the basic benchmark for
science. Of course, science
must be publicly accessible and
able to be duplicated. And with
increased metrics and funding in the
sciences dependent on performance
measured by frequency and
recognition of publications, there
are few alternatives for modern
scientists to succeed – it’s publish or
perish.
But once we begin publishing
academically it’s easy to find
this revered process riddled with
potholes. From the get-go, scientists
alter their manuscripts to the scope
of the journal they intend to publish
in. An editorial board determines if
it fits within that journal’s scope and
mandate – if not, the manuscript
is sent back and it’s re-worked for
another journal, often losing some
of the research integrity in this
constant reshaping process.
Once accepted, it’s sent out to
other scientists for review. But who
are they? Larger publishing houses
have a list of known amenable
reviewers, or sometimes the author
will send in a list; both pathways
which can be biased, and none of
which can force participation from
the whole community. Even with
a double-blind process, given the
increasing specialisation of fields,
reviewers may already know whose
research it is. Nothing prevents the
delivery of a coloured review based
on reviewer-author relationship
for good or bad, and regardless of
research quality. After reviews are
returned, it’s back to an editorial
board who may not always have
the specific expertise to assess the
review’s nuances and decide if
revisions are needed or if it will be
rejected or published.
It’s not a guarantee that either
of these steps will catch errors,
fraudulent data, or bias. The
disastrous outcomes of this were
seen in Japan’s Riken Center scandal
in 2014.
At all steps in the process, there is
potential for human error, oversight,
bias, competition, and nepotism.
It’s time for the science community
to peer-review the peer-review
publication system and figure out
a more cohesive and reliable way
forward.

That steak is good some days, but
there are other B vitamins one can
find in a plethora of other foods.For
example, vitamin B1, or thiamine,
is crucial in the production of
ATP, or the energy currency of
our bodies. Deficiency results in
fatigue, and in more severe cases,
the cardiovascular disorder beriberi.
Another intermediate symptom
is carbohydrate intolerance, as
thiamine also helps regulate blood
glucose levels. The best sources of
B1? Lean pork, spinach, asparagus
and sunflower seeds. So go crazy.

people at Imperial doing
weird, obscure, cool degrees.

comes all the way from Borneo,
courtesy of Matt who is halfway
through a MRes in tropical forest
ecology. Matt has been delighting
us with a stream of cool natural
history pictures, and this is probably
one of my favourites.“The gecko fell
out of the air conditioning unit and
onto the table in front of us where it
proceeded to hatch.We put it under
the identification microscope in
order to watch it hatch. I’m not sure
why the gecko laid its eggs in the
air con, I’d imagine the fluctuations
of temperature wouldn’t be good
for eggs. When it was hatching
it looked very much like a raptor
from Jurassic Park and we all felt
very much like we were in the film,
particularly due to being surrounded
by pristine rainforest at the time!
It was quite a random and surreal
moment!”. I guess life finds a way.

likely to be intercoursing like
bunnies all over the place, and
while it had been previously
suggested that alcohol is linked
with riskier sexual behaviour,
drugs act on the brain in a
very different way to alcohol
and we don’t know what effect
they can have on sexual risks.
It is important to understand
whether sexual health
information needs to be tailored
to these new circumstances.
Thankfully, as Dr. Kerr states,
contrary to the use of alcohol
“we didn’t find a connection
between marijuana use and
poor condom use.”
So in light of this information,

know that you are doing it all

well: always drink responsibly,

responsibly, and always be safe.
under the influence of particular
mind-altering substances in
university students. You guessed it.
It is a scientific study to see whether
there is a correlation between the
use of social lubricants like smoking
weed or drinking booze, and…
actual lubricants, i.e. having lots
and lots of sex. The research polled
284 undergraduate students of the
University of Oregon daily for 24
consecutive days. Results show,
while most intercourse events were
reported by people in committed
relationships (unfortunate
circumstances where marijuana
and alcohol didn’t influence the
frequency of intercourse),singles are
more likely to have sex after a night
of binge drinking or marijuana-
consumption. Captain Obvious... I
mean, Dr. Kerr, lead researcher from
the University of Oregon, stated
that “people may judge risks, such
as whether they will regret having
sex or whether they should use a
condom, differently when they are
drunk.”
Now, I can hear you say it from
here: ‘Well, duh!’ But this is a
matter of public health. Condoms,
these beautiful instruments of safe-
sex, are to this day the method of
contraception that most effectively

underrated vitamin which many of
us fail to get enough of, especially
since one of the main causes of
deficiency is excessive alcohol
consumption; one reason why you

events you keep getting invited to
by that same blonde on Facebook.
Niacin is essential for the energy
generation process, particularly the
glucose-to-ATP pathway. Naturally,
deficiency symptoms include low
appetite, depression and lowered
HDL (good cholesterol) levels. The
best sources of Niacin are fish, fish,

foods like dairy and eggs, but less
conventional wisdom dictates that
a myriad gastrointestinal disorders,
even low-scale types like diarrhoea,
affect our ability to absorb the
vitamin in our gut. Doctors rarely
check B12 levels, and we almost
always assume we get enough, but
many of us really don’t. We need
B12 for the formation of red blood
cells and proper nerve structure and
function, so a deficiency here could
make it easier to contract dementia
or Alzheimer’s-like syndromes,
even autism spectrum disorder in
children. Other effects are memory
problems and consequent cognitive
decline. Clearly, the effects are
much more harmful than most of
us initially envisage. The stars of
the show here are salmon, sardines
and liver, but the one downside here
is that there are no purely vegan
sources, so vegans, take note.
Folks,that sliver of liver will do you
good.Physically and psychologically.
Combined with an overall healthy
diet chock-full of leafy vegetables,
sunflower seeds and fish, you’ll be
sure to attain more than enough
