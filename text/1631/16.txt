GAMES
SUPERHOT is super fun

A stragetic and minimalist first-person shooter where time moves with you
I
magine a game where you are
a super assassin, well-versed
in the arts of weaponry and
hand-to-hand combat. You
mow down countless enemies,
spraying them down with machine
guns, splitting them in half with
a well placed katana swipe or just
beating them to a pulp, like the
good old days. “Wait, why is that
different from tons of other games
that are on the market?” I hear you
cry, dear reader, and I would not
disagree with you. This is where the
twist and specialty of SUPERHOT
comes in: time moves with you.
Basically, when you don’t move,
time stands still. However, if you
even move a finger, the clock starts
ticking and all hell breaks loose.This
combination of kill all bad guys and
the unique time mechanic makes
SUPERHOT a really special game.
At the end of a stressful Monday
(horrible way to start the week I tell
you), I opened up Steam for some
much needed respite.To my delight
SUPERHOT, a game I had been
anticipating for quite some time,
had just been dropped. At first I was
put off by the relatively steep price
of £17.99 (especially for an indie
game), but in the end I decided to
splurge.
I fired up the game, and started
up the main story. I have to say
guys and saving the princess?!).
However, the mechanics of the
game were definitely the highlight
of the experience. The level design,
gunplay and AI were all really good
and I had absolutely nothing to
complain about. What about the
key feature, the game changer: the
time stopping mechanic? I have to
admit I was impressed. It was really
smooth, and at times I did feel like
Neo in that super-famous scene
when I was dodging bullets in slow
motion. Furthermore, the mechanic
wasn’t just some gimmick that you
could just ignore, because if you
don’t play slowly and tactically, the
game is incredibly hard.If you try to
just go Rambo-style on the baddies
you definitely won’t make it longer
than about ten seconds.
Talking about the baddies, and
the art style in general, it is all very
minimalistic, which seems to be
some kind of theme in the gaming
industry right now.The bad guys are
red blocky dudes and the levels are
grey and white blocky blocks that

hint at the things they are supposed
to represent. To be honest this is
completely fine, because sometimes
too many details can distract you
from the game, and in this case
allows you to focus completely on
the gameplay. Furthermore, this
allows this game to run superbly on
pretty much any machine (oh yeah,
it also runs on Windows and Mac).
So I have listed a lot of good things
at the challenges (which are redos
of the main mission, with certain
restrictions/enhancements). While
I have not completed everything,
I have given it a good shot and I
currently stand at five hours. I feel
like ten hours is the most time I am
going to get out of this game, due
to its somewhat repetitive nature,
since the mechanics stay the same,
the scenarios change marginally and
the settings all kind feel the same.
In a sense that makes a me a bit sad,
since this is such a good game. Oh
well.
There are a couple features, like
the uploading of your kill-streak
videos, that I haven’t mentioned
since I didn’t really consider them
that important, although they may
appeal to a different type of gamer.
They all seemed a bit gimmicky to
me, and I haven’t really delved too
deeply into them.
All in all I would say this is
an absolutely excellent game.
SUPERHOT is a really new and
modern take on the tired old genre
that is first person shooters. The
time-stopping mechanic is unique
and super fun to play. However, like
a nice piecce of bacon,it tastes really
good but there ain’t a lot of meat to
it. Given that it is quite expensive, I
would probably hold off on buying
it right now and wait for a Steam
sale, where you will definitely get
the right amount of bang for your
buck.

I was immediately hooked. The
story itself was kind of meh. It
was one of those super indie ones
that make you question your
own existence and wonder if you
have stumbled by chance onto an
interactive experience written by
Nietzsche. To be honest this is not
really a negative and really just a
sign of my fatigue with the indie
scene in general (I mean what is
wrong with just killing the bad
about this game so far, however I do
have one big complaint: the amount
of content in the game versus the
price. I finished the main mission
(and trust me I wasn’t very good
and had to do multiple restarts) in
one sitting of about 3 hours. Then
I took some time to have a crack
at the endless mode which are just
endless battles in various settings
(quite fun and the maps are nice,but
pretty repetitive), and then finally
