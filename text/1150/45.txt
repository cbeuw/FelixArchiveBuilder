1998/99: Year of Imperal
Imperial proves that in 98-99, It was the captial's best
Well, that's it. A n o t h e r year in t h e book .
W e all get a year older a n d s o m e o f y o u
leave. Shit h a p p e n s a n d t h e n y o u die.
But look at t h e c o l u m n t o t h e left a n d if
you are inviolved with sport at IC, y o u
should be p r o u d . T h e fact that w e m a n -
age to b e t h e n u m b e r t w o university in
the country a n d still b e s o g o o d at sport
is a testament to t h e ability o f p e o p l e at
this college.
Right n o w I've got m y corny pat-on-
the -back s p e e c h out o f t h e way, I'd just
like to say h o w m u c h I have enjoyed this
year. I realise t h e s e p a g e s h a v e n ' t
always b e e n t h e most exciting, or t h e
prettiest p a g e s in Felix, b u t I'd like t o
think they have got better as t h e year
ahs g o n e o n . I'll probably b e back next
year(sorry), but s o m e t h i n g I w o u l d like
to s e e is m o r e reporters a n d writers,
and m o r e reports that concentrate o n
the matches rather than what h a p p e n e d
o n the b u s o n t h e w a y there. Thanks t o
all those w h o wrote a n y t h i n g f o r t h e
sports p a g e s this year.
There m a y even b e a n IC sports per-
sonality o f t h e year. O f course t h e bal-
lot will b e rigged. S e e y o u next year
