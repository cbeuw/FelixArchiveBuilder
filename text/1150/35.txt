uerrilla, SFA's third a l b u m , c o n -
firms t h e m t o b e purveyors o f
protean p o p a n d in d o i n g s o
raises t h e m t o a position o f utter rele-
vancy. Their mixed-up, m u d d l e d - u p
tunes seizing t h e Zeitgeist o f spiralling-
a m o r p h i s m w h e r e pop-music currently
resides.
Their raisons d'etre o f s c u l p t i n g
unique songs from a melting pot o f g e n -
res, ranging f r o m d a n c e m u s i c t o m a i n -
stream p o p , is stili very m u c h in evi-
d e n c e . From t h e techno informed Wher-
ever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)
and t h e d r u m a n d bass s o u n d o f The
Door To This House Remains Open t o
the c o m p e l l i n g glam-rocker Do Or Die.
Such diversity is prevalent throughout,
Check It Out contains a Y o u n g M C s a m -
ple, Northern Lites features steel drums
and latino rhythms. Specific Ocean has
synthetically altered vocals a n d Chew-
ing Chewing Cum o p e n s with a jew-
ellery-box piano before transforming into
an ethereal, mellifluent sing-a-long.
However, it is t h e protracted a n d
m o r e reflective s o n g s that a r e o f t h e
greatest interest, d i s c l o s i n g a world-
weariness first m a d e evident o n their
previous a l b u m Radiator (for similar The
End Of The World Is Nigh intonations lis-
ten to t h e Beta Band's self-titled debut).
Something's Come from Nothing a n d
Turning Tides hint at unrest a n d disillu-
sionment, painting a somewhat resigned
outlook.
This is b y far SFA's most e m o t i v e
work, a d d i n g a n e w precision a n d clar-
ity t o their lyrics; t h e h o n e y e d fire In My
Heart refrain o f T got pins a n d needles
for you/I've got butterfly s t o m a c h for
you/And as clouds fly by, I just break
d o w n and cry' pricks the teat ducts from
its angelic package o f a tune.
While the similarly polymorphic Beta
Band offer apparently e x t e m p o r a n e o u s ,
yet c o u r a g e o u s a n d worthwhile, fare,
SFA e x u d e a n air o f calculated p u r p o s e
a m i d t h e confusion. S h o w s o m e faith
and buy this record. H

LO FIDELITY ALLSTARS
On The Floor At The Boutique
Comparisons with Fat Boy Slim
In abundance that's some-
thing to cheer about!
F
or a n y o n e lucky e n o u g h t o have
b e e n t o t h e Big Beat Boutique in
Brighton they will k n o w that it is
currently o n e o f the best club nights o n
the planet. Packed with a y o u n g c r o w d
all u p for a g o o d time, t h e Boutique has
proved that it is certainly t h e place for
clubbers w h o r e m e m b e r t h e real rea-
son c l u b b i n g b e c a m e so popular in t h e
1980s. T h e m u s i c style o f t h e djs
e m p l o y e d is not o f t h e s n o b b y attitude
so often heard in m a n y clubs w h e r e t h e
dj tries t o impress t h e c r o w d b y playing
records n o o n e else has m a n a g e d t o
get their hands o n , for without excep-
tion The Boutique djs play the music t h e
c r o w d want t o hear. T h e music selec-
tion in turn inspires t h e crowd t o d a n c e
as crazily as possible, get as fucked u p
as possible (on drink or drugs) a n d just
have a n absolutely a m a z i n g l y great
time.
With t h e On the Floor at the Bou-
tique series, t h e Skint label is trying to cre-
ate a take h o m e package o f the feeling
of their club b y providing compilations
created b y their mixing maestros. T h e
first in t h e series w a s c o m p i l e d by n o n e
other than Skint super artist Fat Boy Slim,
and n o w t h e s e c o n d c o m e s from t h e
equally talented, if not quite as popular,
Lo-Fidelity Allstars. Following in t h e steps
of the Fat Boy is not as easy j o b for any-'
o n e t o handle, but t h e Lo-Fidelity All-
stars have d o n e themselves proud. Their
mix is as seamless as o n e could possibly
h o p e , and t h e tracks c h o s e n remain per-
fectly complimentary to each other, while
still m a n a g i n g to surprise with tracks y o u
w o u l d never expect t o hear in a club.
O f course, t h e beats remain as big
as possible t h r o u g h o u t t h e entire mix
a n d w h o w o u l d expect anything else?
There are contemporary tracks f r o m t h e
w o n d e r f u l l y English (not French) Les
Rythmes Digitales, Skint's o w n Indian
R o p e m a n , a n d t h e Lo-Fi's also m a n a g e
to t h r o w in a couple o f their o w n offer-
ings as well. However, it is the selection
of t h e o l d tunes that really lift t h e mix
from t h e average level that only the best
d a n c e mix compilations m a n a g e t o sur-
pass. The listener is treated with classics
from t h e Jungle Brothers, Sugarhill hip-
h o p g r a n d d a d d i e s Trouble Funk, a n d
s o m e further inspired choices including
consecutive tracks from T h e Tarns a n d
The Prodigy w h e r e B e Young Be Foolish
Be Happy is m i x e d into t h e s t o n k i n g
Outta Space.
This s e c o n d release in t h e On the
Floor of the Boutique series thus ptoves
to b e exactly everything it sets t o b e .
Although are n o funny little three dia-
m o n d s t a m p e d pills in t h e package, or a
voucher for copious quantities of alcohol,
this mix cd is t h e first step t o creating
your o w n Big Beat Boutique at h o m e d
