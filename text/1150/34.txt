F
or some strange reason,
Pavement have never really ful-
filled their popularity potential on
this side on the Atlantic. Each album
they have released has been greeted
with Immense critical acclaim, and fea-
tured highly in many magazines' top
albums of the particular year they were
released, but the sales figures have
never scaled the same heights.
However, with the release of Terror
Twilight, the reason for Pavement's
underachievement all of a sudden
seems to be obvious.
Terror Twilight is Pavement's fifth
album and for the first time they've hired
a producer. Now Pavement had done
well enough producing themselves, but
the decision to hire Nigel Goodrich, of
OK Computer fame, is near enough a
stroke of genius. With Goodrich's help.
Pavement have produced an album that
is definitely their best yet, and consider-
ing the quality of their previous albums
that's quite an achievement. The dis-
tinctive sound of Pavement remains and
there's still that slight lo-fi edge to the
sound, but the new production is a rev-
olution. Gone is the oddness that Pave-
ment have sometimes tended to drift
Into, and welcome to some beautifully
produced, arranged and performed
tracks that the best Britpop bands can
only aspire to.
The first single to be released from
the album is the wonderfully titled Car-
rot Rope. Receiving extensive airtime on
Radio 1, it's the kind of tune Blur wished
they could write. Indeed Terror Twilight
is the kind of album Blur wished they
could write. The album's first track Spit on
a Stranger kicks it off to an incredible start
and the rest of the album seems to just
fall perfectly into place. Major League is
another highlight, as is the uptempo
Billy whose sound slides perfectly
between rough and smooth in away that
only the sound of Pavement can.
With Terror Twilight, Pavement are
releasing one of the albums of the year,
and if you like quality music and beauti-
ful tunes you must have this album.EJ

THE BETA BAND
The Beta Band
The Beta Band relaxing on a
day off from the studio.
T
o call the Beta Band eclectic is
something of an understate-
ment; their first three EPs
Champion Versions, The Patty Patty
Sound and Los Amigos Del Beta
Bandldos demonstrated an awesome
array of influences, infusing Public
Enemy, Neil Young and Krautrock with a
hint of any other pop style you care to
mention. This album, their eponymous,
augments the plan, confirming them to
be true visionaries or, it being a fine
line they tread, confused musical-
alchemists.
Opening track The Beta Band Rap
submerges a personal account of the
band's story-so-far in a dense auditory
mosaic of a fairground-carousel tune,
stoned funk and 50's rock n' roll. Second
track It's Not Too Beautiful is ttuly capti-
vating; opening a la Sugar Spun Sister
with a chugging guitar, the song runs
aground twice o n Wagnerian strings
whilst mellifluous vocals paradoxically
announce And I Will Fly, only for the
song to be finally sunk by an Also Sprach
Zarathustra coda.
The marriage of dub-bass, hip-hop
drum-beats, samba rhythms, steel-drums,
mantras, chants and bedevilled sound-
effects emanating from just about any-
thing they could lay their inquisitive
hands upon, across the remaining eight
tracks, makes for a bewildering infectious
stew.
The seemingly orderless composi-
tions that frame frankly inane lyrics about
motorway travel and the band's opinion
on Beach Boys' albums appear to make
perfect sense. They aren't saying any-
thing new or profound and all the music
has been heard before, just not in the
same song. And maybe that's the point,
maybe the 'Well of Pop-Music' has run
dry over the last forty years, the only
option being a chaotic scramble from
one genre to another. Maybe pop-music
was always living on borrowed time, its
brief being finite, every nuance of the
human condition and facet of human
emotion having already been chroni-
cled. Is it time to get virtual? Music is
dead, long live the video game? El
