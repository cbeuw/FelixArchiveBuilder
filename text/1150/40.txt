By taking t h e c o m b i n a t i o n o f t w o o f L o n d o n ' s bets loved under-
g r o u n d DJs, a n d t h e musical mastery o f ex-Brand N e w Heavy Neil
Cowley, this a l b u m fuses together t h e 'in' influences o f jazz, funk
a n d soul. Sadly, t h e a l b u m is let d o w n by t h e lack o f variation a n d
as you're listening to it, y o u get t h e f e e l i n g that n o effort has b e e n
m a d e to d e f i n e each s o n g - they all s o u n d t h e s a m e . The vocals
are alright, but there are plenty o f other a l b u m s out there that use
the s a m e genres but to m u c h better effect. This actually s o u n d s
like a Brand N e w Heavy a l b u m - there's a surprise! O u t n o w .
