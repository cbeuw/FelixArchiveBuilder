NOVEL WITH COCAINE
by M. Ageyev
N
ovel With Cocaine
was written in the
early thirties, but
this is the first time it has
been published here.
This edition contains an
introduction by author
and literary critic Will Self,
which is heavy on psy-
chological musings, and
worth reading for its
description of the book
as "a text the genesis of
which Is exactly congru-
ent with its own queered
ontology." Answers on a
postcard...
This is a strange
book in many ways.
Nothing is known about
the author, and it may or
may not be autobior
graphical. It follows the
life of a young Russian,
Vadim, as he finishes
school and b e c o m e s
addicted to cocaine, set in 1917
Moscow.
This is, in essence, a remarkably
modern story of teen angst; drugs,
w o m e n and self-loathing are super-
imposed onto school and domestic
life. The different parts of the story
seem to be tacked together without
any regard for one another - there's lit-
tle absolute timeframe, and the loca-
tions are vague. However, the plot is
reasonably straightforward and the
book is a fairly easy read.
Vadim, the protagonist, is a rather
unlikable character,- he's selfish and
arrogant, behaves very badly towards
his ageing mother, and his self-pitying
introspection evokes distaste rather
than sympathy. He's a complex and
well-drawn character, just not an espe-
cially nice one. The overall effect is to
detach the reader from him, leaving
the book a little flat and vaguely
depressing.
O n the other hand, the quality of
writing is excellent. Vadim's first expe-
rience with cocaine, in particular, is
evocative, realistic and its analytic style
is fascinating. The approach of an intel-
ligent mind attempting to dissect and
make sense of what is happening to it
has been used before and since to
great effect; here the attention to
detail and rich descriptive writing make
the sequence vivid and absorbing.
The writing alone makes this a
worthwhile read; the story isn't exactly
gripping, but it's a fascinating book.
This is a vaguely cautionary tale, but
the blame is placed more on Vadim's
personality than any inherent dangers
of drug usage. This will sit nicely along-
side Naked Lunch, Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas and Trainspotting as a
good example of the genre's roots.

A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR
by John Irving
A //f/lBOW
FOR
J
ohn Irving wrote The World Accord-
ing to Garp. N o w I haven't read
this but I have heard of it, so he
must be quite famous. With this in
mind I started reading his latest novel
expecting it to be at least well writ-
ten... and it is.
The book is split
into three sections
spread over a 40-year
period starting in 1958.
The characters in the
book are all writers (or
aspiring writers) and the
story is concerned with
the complex relations
between them. In 1958,
a young college student
begins a vacation job
as a writer's assistant to
a famous children's
author, w h o is g o i n g
through the process of
separating from his
wife. The student
c o m e s of a g e , as he
b e c o m e s a pawn
between them. The
relationships described
are very intense and the
story ranges from the
sad through to the
funny. The summer
ends badly but the
events have a long-term effect on the
student and the writer's four-year-old
daughter.
The next two sections of the
b o o k are set in the 1990s and the
characters have all m o v e d on in the
world. O u r y o u n g 'hero' from the
first section is an average writer
whilst the m u c h y o u n g e r girl is
highly successful. The author again
f o c u s e s o n the relationships
between the characters, a l t h o u g h
this time the ages of the characters
are reversed.
My main a n n o y a n c e with the
book is a tendency by the author to
leap about as the story progresses.
The timeline is therefore quite dis-
jointed but not particularly difficult to
grasp.
O n e of the things I did like most
about the novel is the fact that all
the main characters are writers. This
means that the main text is inter-
spersed with readings or chapters
from their own books. This proves to
be both entertaining and a useful
tool for explaining s o m e of their
motivations.
Overall I would say that this is
quite an enjoyable book to read and
that it will particularly a p p e a l to
those with a love of emotive rela-
tionships or an interest in writing.
