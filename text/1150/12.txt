The Real World
Your average student at IC spends far
too much time around other students,
and ends up isolating themselves from
the rest of society. Recently Kevin took
a group of IC students off the campus
to a real pub, where
inevitably a good pro-
portion of the cus-
tomers were over
the age of 23. The
students had appar-
ently never experi-
enced the behaviour
of drunk thirty-some-
things before, and
were certainly not
impressed by what
they saw. They found
this environment
Intolerable and were begging to return
to their safe student-y world as quickly
as possible.

Fireworks Please
The new dean of the
Royal College of Sci-
ence has suggested
that the RCSU should
hold an event for
bonfire night next
year. The new Dean
is the professor in
charge of Imperial's
Plasma Physics
Group. Kevin antici-
pates that a fireworks
display organised by
the Imperial College
Plasma Physics group should be a seri-
ously impressive spectacle.
Democracy in Action
Every so often something happens to
Kevin that reminds him what a brilliant
place London is. This week it was the
European Elections that enraptured
Kevin. Where else but In London - the
heart of our eccentric and developed
democracy - would the process of vot-
ing be so much fun? Kevin found the
whole process rather amusing, espe-
cially as the ballot paper was about
three foot long, longer than the desk in
the polling booth. O n unrolling the
scroll-like ballot paper, 150 candidates
and 15 parties, along with their corre-
sponding logos and paragraph of elec-
tion drivel confronted Kevin.
Having located the appropriate loca-
tion for his cross, the next challenge was
to get the paper into the ballot box,
which had obviously been designed for
papers of more modest proportions.
Kevin was dismayed to hear that it is
apparently trendy to say that you don't
vote In European Elections. Most of
Kevin's fellow students, being wannabe
trendies, didn't bother to vote.
Kevin hopes that the slightly guilty
tones in which pathetic excuses for not
voting were made indicates that there
is some hope left. With better publicity,
and increased awareness, perhaps in
future students will not let their chance
to influence the way their society is run
pass by so lightly.
W
ell it's almost over, probably
the most bizarre year in my
life. So I thought I'd reflect
on the year that's been.
When I first got the job, I saw the
Union as a cheap place for a good
night out, great fun to work in and not
much else. I'd never got around to
joining a club or society, although the
idea did appeal to me, and I'd only
ever voted in the elections on the
basis of g o o d posters. If you had
asked me then my opinion of anyone
holding a post in the student union,
the reply would have been the stan-
dard uninformed generalisation, that
everyone was a hack.
By the time the summer came, I
already had a reputation as being anti-
medic, despite my frequent social vis-
its to their bars. And then it hit me.
What the hell was I going to do for a
whole year? The maner in which I was
elected had allowed me to get through
hustings and the like without actually
forming any policies and my knowl-
edge of how I could implement them
if I did have any was limited to my
The Importance of Pullovers
Kevin was dozing in a Physics lecture
recently, when the lecturer succeeded
in grabbing the attention of the whole
lecture theatre by announcing: "Things
are about to get serious, so I'm going
to take off my pullover for this next
bit." On removal of his multicoloured
knitwear the lecturer proceeded to
Dazed & Confused
Working in South Kensington, Imperial
College students regularly find them-
selves dealing with lost tourists. Kevin
has noticed that some students are
unwittingly and unintentionally confus-
ing these lost souls. When confronted
by lost Americans on Imperial College
Road searching for the Science
Museum, the response of an IC stu-
dent is typically to turn towards the
Chemistry building, point directly at the
Science Museum, ignoring the build-
ings in the way, and say "that way."
Which leaves your average tourist utterly
bemused and confused.
Another c o m m o n source of lost
individuals is Prince Consort Road,
where often there are people looking
for the Royal Albert Hall. Bizarrely this
occurs even at times when the answer
is simply to follow the other people
wearing turbans / Salvation Army uni-
forms / Christian yoof dog tags / dinner
jackets, or whatever 'uniform' the peo-
ple attending the event happen to be
wearing.
I'll Be Back
Kevin has been promised that he will be
returning to Felix next year. To conclude
this year, Kevin would like to congratu-
late Mr Hellard, on being a popular, effi-
cient, clued up, generally "Fantastic"
President. Most students are not aware
of the more boring aspects of the Pres-
ident's job, and when the person in
the job is not a self-publicist, a lot of the
work can appear to go unacknowl-
edged. Kevin would like to see Tasha,
her cronies, and her flatmates do as
good a job impartially running ICU next
year.
And on that bombshell, we depart.

The Hellard Era Comes To An End

h o w to blag

s o m e t h i n g
about the

copies of Felix
and a few coun-
cil minutes.
L u c k i l y
Andy had left
me with a few 1
toys to play
with. The dB's
redevelopment
was well under-
way and the
contract for the
University of
L o n d o n U n i o n
was still
unsigned and
then the hard-
est realisation of my life occurred: Hav-
ing relied just on cramming for the
previous two years, I might actually
have to do some work.
The rest of
the story starts
to get boring
and, if you've
been reading
Felix, hopefully
you'll know
most of it. I
have formu-
lated s o m e
opinions along
the way,
though, and
become as bit-
ter and twisted
as even Mr
Baker. Firstly, I
don't believe in
the conspiracy
that the College
are all ganging
up in an
asserted effort
to get the
Union. I do however believe that the
Union is an after thought for them,
seen as a thorn in their side and if they
want something we have, they will
have no qualms trying to take it from
us. Just look at the Union Bookshop,
Junior C o m m o n Room Refurbishment,
the Southside Gym and possibly even
the Newsagent.
Secondly though, I have realised
that apart from the few individuals in
'Union Politics' for its sheer thrill and
rush, most people in Union positions
are involved for selfless reasons and
without their input the Union would be
crumbling.
I will now predictably try and sell
the Union, but at least it's easy to.
Until this year, I never realised how
much the Union can help the average
student's life. Whether in looking for
accommodation, fighting an academic
appeal or even meeting graduate
tecruiters, the Union has the mecha-
nisms and expertise to help you along
every step of the way.
So do I think I did a good job? I'd
rather not comment, but I've enjoyed
it and I got to spend a whole year liv-
ing only ten meters away from a pint
of Carlsberg... a Carlsberg for only
Â£1.18 at that.
