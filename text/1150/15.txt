Although the centre had been closing on
Tuesday afternoons for some time, a
serious accident on the afternoon of 1
December prompted a barrage of criti-
cism, noticeably from Health and Safety
reps. The debate attracted the attention
of Simon Baker and David Hellard, the lat-
ter pursuing the matter for some time
and even threatening protest action.
The Health Centre's sign lied...
However, the ICU President came
under fire himself after presenting pro-
posals concerning CCU clubs to ICU
Council. Hellard suggested that such
clubs should be moved to ICU control, an
Idea immediately condemned by CCU
exec members. Despite attempts to jus-
tify his position and some support from
within the Union, it was clear that this
was one issue CCUs were not easily
going to be defeated on.
A minor news story at the time
revealed that STA Academic Travel were
to be replaced, and questions were
being raised concerning the way the
new service provider was being chosen.
Rumours of financial discrepancies were
rife, but without any actual facts the
issue subsided until resurrected by Simon
Baker late in the Summer term.
Trouble on campus was also a theme
for the month, with several thefts affect-
ing the Union and Electrical Engineering.
Violence erupted after a Tamil night on
College premises, although it was later
revealed that the perpetrators had not
been members of the college.
January
Violence unfortunately marked the start
of the Spring term also, as a member of
college's catering staff was attacked in
the JCR. The men responsible took off
with a substantial sum of money, but
luckily the victim was not seriously
injured. Bad news also came in the form
of another meningitis case, leading to
the hospitalisation of a first year, but for-
tunately the student concerned recov-
ered.
Wade Gayed, ICSMSU President,
began to enjoy a much less stressful life,
after Felix revealed that £55,000 origi-
nally thought to** have gone 'missing'
from the medics' reserves had in fact
been lost due to an accountancy error by
the college. The medics also enjoyed a
very successful RAG week, although
there was some trouble when a group of
students attempted to hitch a lift on the
M l .
Meanwhile ICU RAG faced a set-back
with the announcement that there would
be no beer fest in RAG week, which had
been rescheduled for the end of January
following similar problems in the previ-
ous term. The Sponsored Nude Kamikaze
Parachute Jump, however, was more suc-
cessful than last year, with sixteen blokes
running naked from Harrods to the
Union and raising over £1,000 in the
that of DP (Education & Welfare).
January also saw a short letter com-
plaining about the lack of a social area
at Clayponds Hall in South Ealing. More
was to come, and eventually the resi-
dents would have their way, but at a
price...
February
This was elections month. In the end an
unprecedented fourteen candidates
stood, with seven for ICU President. On
paper the similarities between the can-
didates outweighed the differences, but
Natasha Newton, being the only medic,
was always going to be the favourite.
Robin Pitt stood out as the only candidate
with a strong political agenda, favouring
a closer association with the NUS, and
Dennis Patrickson ran a good campaign,
based on communication, communica-
tion, communication.
It seemed that the current sabbs1
dream had been realised, and students
were further encouraged by the offer of
£1 a pint beer at the South Ken hus-
tings. Ian Clifford (standing for DP(F&S))
turned up to hustings in drag, fulfiling a
promise made at the RAG slave auction
earlier in the year. Stuart Cook, standing
for ICU President, preferred the mini-
malist approach, and didn't turn up for
ICU suffered a vandalised Coke machine
SNKPJers heading for glory
process.
Inside ICU the politics was hotting
up. The CCU v Hellard debate raged on
through another meeting of ICU Coun-
cil, with the President facing letters of
complaint and criticism from all the CCUs,
most notably from RSM President Alastair
fox. College announced that the Union
would get the East and West wing base-
ments of Beit Quad when the redevel-
opment was finished in the summer of
2000, allaying the fears of the previous
term. Sabbatical elections were
approaching rapidly, with the current
sabbatical team determined to increase
awareness of their importance within
the student populace. This year also saw
the creation of a new sabbatical position,
Prospective Presidents prove their worth
hustings or mount a campaign.
The results, though, were fairly pre-
dictable. Both Kevin Butcher (DP(E&W))
and David Roberts (Felix Editor) won easy
victories over New Election, while Tim
Trailor defeated Duncan Field in the con-
test for DP(C&S). Natasha Newton was
elected as ICU President, thanks largely
•to a large medic vote, with Dennis
Patrickson the only other candidate to
come close. Numerous recounts even-
tually elected Ian Clifford as DP(F&S), his
winning margin being just one vote.
Sports grounds were on the agenda
this month, with rumours circulating that
College planned to sell Teddington in the
not too distant future. A College pro-
posal suggested Imperial should aim for
just one ground and, as Harlington is the
only one large enough, Cobham looked
like it would be up for sale too. Clearly
Tim Trailor will have work to do next
year. Meanwhile Chelsea FC suffered a
terrible fate at Harlington during a train-
ing session, when various Rolexes and
thousands in cash were stolen from the
players' changing rooms.
Early on in the month ICU Council
decided that ICSMSU should keep its
sabbatical officer for another year, mean-
ing that a successor was needed for the
2000/01 year. Senior sources at St Mary's
reported to Felix that Glaxo were intend-
ing to buy several floors of the medical
school - allegations vehemently denied
by other senior sources in ICSM. Clearly
there was, and probably still is, some
sort of power struggle going on within
the corridors of power.
The annual problem of bike theft
raised its head again, starting with a few
letters accusing security of not doing
enough to combat the problem. Ken
Weir, Head of Security, fought back,
maintaining that the college was doing
all it could, and that the sheer number of
bikes on the South Ken campus meant
it was always going to be a target.
The first signs of problems for the
Summer Ball came in the form of a
£16,500 deficit on their budget, which
had to be made up with sponsorship. As
the term drew on and no definite spon-
sors appeared, the event looked in
doubt... Early signs of possible exam dis-
ruption in the summer also appeared, as
the Association of University Teachers
threatened strike action in its pay dispute,
which continued unresolved throughout
the term.
ICU's RAG was announced to have
been a success, raising £5,000 for char-
ity and providing a good few laughs
along the way. Amusement was also
provided by a spate of Felix imitations,
started off by Guildsheet Editor Dinesh
Ganesarajah. After considering legal
action, felix decided that imitation was
RAG goes the Full Monty..
