23 June 1999 Competition
Win an Ericsson Palmtop
Name the new Internet service for IC and win!
Imperial College has got together with
Ericsson, the telephone people, and is
launching a Personal Telephone & Media
Service for students this autumn. This
means that, not only are there a host of
useful telephone services available, but
soon we will have our own Internet Ser-
vice, dedicated to the needs of IC stu-
dents and staff. Thing like e-mail
addresses.which you can keep for life
and other associated goodies will be avail-
able from next term.
But what do we call It?
This is where you come in. In conjunction
with Ericsson we are running a competi-
tion to name the service. The prize? An
Ericsson MC16 palmtop computer.
What you need to do..
All you need to do is come up with a
name that can be used for all e-mail
addresses - and makes people think of
Imperial College too. It must be of the
form xxxxx.net, and we have already iden-
tified that the names ic.net, impcoll.net
and imperial.net are already in use, so be
creative.
The small print
Answers should be submitted to
c.lnce@lc.ac.uk before the end of the
month. If you're leaving College then
don't forget to attach a contact address or
phone number, so that we can notify you
of your prize.
Can all recipients of ICU Colours
please pick up their awards certificates, ties
and pins from Pat Baker In the Union Office
as soon as possible.
