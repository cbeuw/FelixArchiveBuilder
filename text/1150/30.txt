Star wars - Episode One - Racer (N64)
Lucasarts
One line summary
Lucasarts turns the handle and another
game plops out of the Star Wars cash
cow.
What's It all about
The race scene from Episode O n e is
turned into a race game for the Nin-
tendo. These are not normal cars though.
Imagine a bath-tub being pulled by two
jet engines on long pieces of spaghetti
- oh and they manage to hover about a
metre off the ground. Having the
engines in front and attached by wet
spaghetti means that the engines tend to
get banged about a lot and have a habit
of snapping off at the slightest hint of a
shunt. They also run a little bit fast, 400-
600 mph, and that's before turning up
the gas and kicking in the afterburners.
Good Graphics
Take Wipeout 64, take out
the darkness, speed it up
a fraction and place Star
Wars characters in this slip-
pery swiff moving world.
The animation of the craft
bouncing over the rough
surfaces is sublime. View it
from far behind, close
behind, from the driver's
seat or even looking back-
wards from the front -
though this tends to end
with a pile of twisted metal within a few
seconds
Seraphim Sounds
It is a Lucas Arts star wars games, so lots
of orchestrated space themes in the
background. Jake f loyd (Anakin from the
film) and other characters are sampled
for phrases which rapidly become repet-
itive and tiresome - unless you are drunk,
then they become very funny, honest.
The other sounds are just as impressive
and many are taken from the actual film,
such as when the racer glances the sur-
faces and the edges of the track, pro-
ducing scraping sounds that are a second
cousin away from the finger nails drag-
ging down a blackboard classic. A sound
to absolutely convince you something is
very wrong.
Great Gameplay
Over 20 tracks, over three
different race series, with
most tracks having various
little secret short-cuts - well
not so much secret as very
difficult - this game will
not be finished in a day.
Many tracks also feature
obstacles which will play
hell with the engines, and while you can
repair on the move, it slows down the
racer - avoid them. The control method
is smooth and simple with the analogue
controller, within minutes you will be
sliding the bathtub, sorry, pod racer Into
corners on the easy circuits - on the
expert circuits you will still be smashing
into the walls with the rest of us mortals.
Sex and Violence
1> This is Star Wars
2> This is Lucasarts
3> The main character is
only a young boy.
Not even a hint of a
kiss at the end of a race.
Best bit
Losing an engine and
watching the tub lose con-
trol at 400 mph. The crash
is spectacular in the least.
Worst bit
The kid's voice shouting "it's working"
when repairing; it does start to tire.
So who will get it
Race fans, N64 owners wanting another
good game, Star Wars fans. Just try it in
Virgin and not buy it there and then -1
dare you.

R-Type Delta (PSX)
One line summary
The 2D shooter from the arcade is back
at home.
What's It all about
Back at the dawn of time a 2D shooter
game ruled the roost of the arcades. Fly-
ing the R9 craft you start with a simple
gun and beam weapon that charges
the longer you hold the button down.
Shoot enough baddies that pop out of
the ground, the sea, anywhere a baddie
could possibly pop up and you can
upgrade the weapons on the ship.
Well it's back in both its original
form and with a couple of
friends (with new and dif-
ferent weapons). All of
which have a force unit,
an indestructible buddy in
the form of a weapon
loaded ball. The ball can
dock with the front, the
back of the ship or be sent
off to attack the enemy at
the corners of the screen.
A very useful tool - get-
ting the force unit to cover
your tail is one task worth learning.
Good Graphics
Very colourful... graphics-wise the game
is not going to be pushing for any prizes.
They might be smooth but are not par-
ticularly complex. Being a home version
of an ancient arcade game though does-
n't mean that the graphics have not
been skimped on. The 2D nature of the
original have been worked over so that
the bad bosses weave in and out of the
screen, even if your ship is unable to
take advantage of the third dimension.
Seraphim Sounds
It's based upon an old
arcade game shooter.
O n c e again it is not
exactly going to contest
for audio track of the year.
The standard bangs and
pops form almost the
whole auditory entertain-
ment. There is a nice
touch when you change your environ-
ment and the background tune changes
-enter the water and it all goes mellow.
Great Gameplay
I was brought up in the 80's where side-
on arcade shoot-em-ups ruled the
arcade games. Beat-em-ups were for
the weird crowd. The gameplay of R-Type
Delta is not that different from other
side on shooters - you either love them
or you hate them. I love this even if it
starts to become a case of learning
which waves of enemies come from
which direction.
Sex and Violence
Violence against aliens doesn't really
count... they ask for it every time.
Best bit
Absorbing enemy fire with your force
unit until you can use the delta weapon.
.A complete orgy of destruction.
Worst bit
The slowing down of the game when
too many things appear, a price paid
because of the large and colourful ships.
So who will get It
The Playstation owner who wants to
relive the old arcade days, or wants a
decent side-on-shooter - it's the best of
its kind.
