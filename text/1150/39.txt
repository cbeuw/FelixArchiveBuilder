Singles Round-up
Polanskl - God Only Knows
Screechy indie band with a very clouded
sound, much in the vein of a second rate
Mansun, (Oh dear). The male vocalist's
singing is constantly lost in the seemingly
unstructured 'noise' that the rest of the
Music 43
Music Editorial
band makes, with none of the three
tracks on the single having any impact or
ingenuity at all.
Clinic - 77?e Second Line
Well, this is different. The Second Line
has a deconstructed sound that is a
blend of the Pixies surf-rock with Arab
Strap's mumbling, musing vocal style.
The B-sides are very different though,
much more rocky and well driven,
although I have serious doubts that the
lead singer is in fact singing in English!
MeOne-EP.
Produced by the Roots this E.P. is funky
and fresh, a smooth and groovy sound
for the summer. Me-One's rappers
sound like a fusion between Bob Marley
and a slightly more talented Wyclef
(Fugees). The E.P.'s production shies
away from the hard beats of much of the
hip-hop around at the moment and
comes with a mellow jazzy flavour. Pretty
good.
Fridge - OfEP
Now I quite like Fridge, I've reviewed two
of their albums in the past but this sin-
gle, confusingly named the Of EP is a
and is infused with all sort of clicks and
twitters, as well as some funky vocal
samples.
G o m e z -Bring It On
Well you've probably heard and seen
this single all over the place already. It's
a strong retro inspired funky indie track.
The balance between the guitats and
drums complement the rough vocal style
of the lead singet and it is not a bad lit-
tle track at all.
Rosko-GetOut
Well, a new indie three piece - what a
novelty! These three lads look frighten-
Ingly like several Imperial College stu-
dents I know, but let's not hold that
against them. The first track Get Out is
really quite good, and has the sound of
many of the seminal early nineties indie
bands. The B-sides live up to their posi-
tion, being somewhat less inspired than
the title track. EI
Ramzl
ing this. Entertaining, inventive and inno-
vative with B-sides that drip with oodles
more talent than the average white
band. A poor man's Gomez.
Freestylers featuring Definition of Sound
Here We Go
'Here we g o on a ride with the new
Freestylers,' rings the chorus in between
the rap verses that can't help but put a
smile on your face. Feel-good music for
a happy summer. Go on, let your hair
down and dance like a care-free idiot.
Remixes to rock out to, as well. Nice
one, lads.
Liz Horsman - Just Thinking
Labelmates with Blur, Liz Horsman does
a decent job of mixing grunge-y guitars
with some traditional female angst. Just
poppy enough to grab the young
slight departure from their highly minimal
musical style. Version, the first track on
the single, is driven by a big bass beat
teenager market. Just enough rock to
please the indie crowd. However, it could
be just a bit too much of the glossy pro-
duction to really have any deep impact
on you. Sonic meat and potatoes.
Everlast - finds
Very good stuff. His album, WhiteyFord
Sings the Blues, is crammed with tales of
urban woe. This single is no exception
with some inspired rhymes and poignant
themes. 'If you're broke, she spit. If you're
rich, she might swallow,' is the type of
thing that makes it through to the radio
edit. If you've liked his first two singles,
I strongly recommend you give his album
a listen.
Snow Patrol - Starflghter Pilot
Retro-space-rock is probably some sort of
oxymoron or something but retro-space-
rock is perhaps the only way of describ-
Jennlfer Lopez - If You Had My Love
You know Jennifer Lopez, right. George
Clooney got to be crammed inside a car
trunk with her in last year's coolest film,
Out O f Sight. She's the sexy actress with
a body to drool over. So what's the deal
with this R&B-samba single? Well, it's not
a one-off, as there's an album on the way
as well. It's also not a complete load of
toss either, as far as R&B tracks go. Looks
like we'll have to go with Hollywood Star
in Decent Single Shocker!
Blur - Coffee + TV
Second single off 13 and first single (I
think) to feature Damon not on lead
vocals. Perfect hangover music. Remixes
of the stonking album track, Bugman,
prove that they can actually fuck about
with their sound even more than they did
on their album. Sometimes Blur have to
be heard to be believed.
Subclrcus - Do You Feel Loved?
My patience has worn thin. I thought I
could get through a whole batch of sin-
gles without slating someone. Don't get
me wrong. Their now long distant offer-
ing, 86'D, was one of my favourite singles
of the time alongside the Stereophonies'
first release of Local Boy in the Photo-
graph. How the times can change,
though. Do You Feel Loved? is irritating
dumb-rock. Full-stop. El
