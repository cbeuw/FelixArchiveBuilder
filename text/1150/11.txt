Right Angles to the Rising Sun
Law and Order in a crime-free land
T
hey say the strangest things... If
Roger Whittaker, that great social
visionary and legendary M O R bal-
ladeer, is to be believed, not only does
England "swing like a pendulum do"
but we also have "Bobbies on bicycles
two by two". H m m m . Perhaps when
Granny was a little girl, but these days it's
more a case of Kevlar body armour and
rapid response vehicles, so I'm told; but
one thing's for sure - officers of the law
never go abroad without at least one of
their pals in tow. But it's a comforting
and cosy thought, isn't it? The image of
kindly Dixon of Dock Green with his
bendy-kneed "evenin' all" is as much
part of British consciousness as warm
beer, overpriced hotels and losing to
Argentina in the World Cup. It's perhaps
no surprise then that we are unwilling
to face up to the fact that it's about as
realistic a picture of modern society as
porridge is of 'oat' cuisine. Sadly, in the
last few years the image of the police
force, as well as an alarming number of
persons in their custody, has taken a
severe battering. I've lost count of how
many convictions have recently been
overturned on appeal as being "unsafe
and unsatisfactory", let alone those
cases that have gone by the board
because of some technical irregularity.
Whilst some of those
who have been set
free should probably
still be languishing at
Her Majesty's plea-
sure, the fact that a
fair few of them are
worthy of being given
the benefit of the
doubt is more than a
little worrying. But
let's not be too hard
on our boys in blue.
They do a nigh-
Impossible job under
immensely trying and stressful condi-
tions, normally only experienced by us
civilians when watching a feature-length
episode of Little House on the Prairie.
Much-trumpeted 'loss of respect for
authority', helmets that look like ladies'
bosoms and alleged chronic under-
manning have all taken their toll on
police morale. This last point is a partic-
ularly sensitive one - a recent report
unearthed the disturbing finding that
some UK Metropolitan forces are so
short-staffed that increasingly suspects
are having to write their own confes-
sions.
It's easy to forget in the enlight-
ened days in which we live that the
police force as we know it today is a rel-
atively new beast. It was not until the

1820s that the then
Home Secretary, Robert
Peel had the brainwave
of putting together a custom-built force
dedicated to upholding the peace of the
Realm. Incidentally Peel, a Tory (they
were banging on about being the party
of Law and
Order even
then it would
seem), went on
to be Prime
Minister - twice

force in Britain,
but he gave them their first nicknames
- "peelers" or "bobbies" - porcine refer-
ences were to come at a later date.
Why do I bring up all this guff, I hear
you ask ? No reason in particular, it's just
that last Saturday night I had my first run
in with the Japanese police since I came
to this fair (and mind-bogglingly expen-
sive) island. Well, not so much a run in
as a weave in. My experience of the
long arm of the law
in any country, apart
from the incident on
our school trip to La
Rochelle involving
the Chinese fire-
crackers, a Sherbet
Dib-Dab and Mrs Fro-
bisher's lunch box
(and I want to
emphasise that all
charges were
dropped), has thank-
fully been limited to
the occasional
request to know the time. But in the
case of the episode to which I'm refer-
ring, I had occasion to consult the local
rozzers (known affectionately as
omawarisan - literally 'the honourable
person who makes his rounds') on a far
weightier matter. It was a problem I
have frequently experienced back home
as well as over here: I was trying to find
my way to the pub and I had got lost. It's
a little known and utterly bewildering
fact that in Japan - a country so techno-
logically advanced that they produce
portable televisions the size of a grain
of sand - most small streets have neither
names nor pavements, so going out for
a swift half of an evening can be a con-
fusing and hazardous business at the
best of times. Being already two-and-a-
half sheets to the wind,
and with a set of scribbled
directions in Japanese that
looked more like a lottery ticket from
Mars than a map, this was quite defi-
nitely not the best of times, hence my
need for assistance in finding the bar.
Now nor-
mally offi-
cers of the
law and alco-
hol have as
much of an
affinity as
Italians and
income tax,
but on this
point as on
so many oth-
ers, Japan is
different.
This is mainly
due to the fact that, except for the indict-
ment of top government bureaucrats or
leading businessmen on charges of
bribery and corruption every half hour or
so, Japan has very little of what you or I
would recognise as crime, leaving their
officers of the law free to provide other
services such as directing half-cut and
slurring foreigners to pubs. But don't run
away with the idea that the police over
here take the prob-
lem of public wrong-
doing lightly. Quite
the opposite. The
very scarcity of crime
means that when
they actually get a
chance to do their
Carter and Regan bit,
they make the most
of it and will go to
extraordinary lengths
to get their man.
Take for instance
the case of a friend of
mine who one night parked his bicycle
outside the main station in Sendai, prior
to heading off to teach English to one
of his private students. If the place
where he had chosen to leave his trusty
steed had been in the suburbs - which
are dangerously poorly lit in Japan - he
had reasoned, he might have great dif-
ficulty locating it again, which is why he
had left it where he had. My friend's
bike was the standard model - two
wheels, Sturmey-Archer gears and a lit-
tle shopping basket on the front - there
are millions like it and it was certainly not
worth stealing. Except to one person it
would appear, because when my friend,
his pedagogical duties discharged,
returned to the appointed spot, his bike
was nowhere to be seen. Thinking he
"...the scarcity of crime

police actually get the
chance to do their
Carter and Regan bit,
they really make the
most of it..."
had simply forgotten where he had left
it, my friend searched amongst the
crowd of others for a good twenty min-
utes before giving it up as a bad job.
Coming from New York - where even
kindergarten teachers have taken to car-
rying concealed weapons for their own
personal safety - his natural instincts
were to put it down to experience, but
seeing as the item in question had been
a gift from a grateful student as a thank-
you for "extra-curricula activities", it had
a certain amount of sentimental value
and he decided to report its disappear-
ance. He heard nothing more for two
months and had almost forgotten all
about it - he'd even bought another
bike - when he received a phone call
from the local police office asking him
to come and pick up his lost property.
He duly went along and was introduced
to the omawarisan who had "been
assigned to the case". Honestly. That's
how little crime they have here - they
had had one of their men out scouring
the neighbourhood for a beaten-up bicy-
cle that could have been replaced for
fifty quid. Now that's service. I doubt that
Special Branch back home would have
time for that - they're much too busy
stamping out heroin smuggling and
counting the number of corpses buried
in Fred West's back
garden.
I swerved into
the police station
and, approaching the
counter, I gave the
desk sergeant my
most winning smile
before asking direc-
tions to Murphy's Bar
in the best Japanese
I could manage
under the circum-
stances. Despite the
fact that I now
appeared to be speaking in Swahili, I
finally succeeded in getting my point
across, and PC Plod-san accordingly took
me outside and, smiling broadly pointed
down the street to where the pub sign
was winking at me enticingly. I thanked
him with a feeble wave of the hand
and wove off to the said establishment
where there was a pint of Guinness
with my name on it. If he had been sur-
prised to see me - a 6'3" tall foreigner
half-cut and sweating - come sloping
into the lobby of his quiet little office ask-
ing him to show me the way to the
pub, one can only guess at his reaction
when I came back in a couple of hours
later, significantly the worse for wear,
grinning like a lunatic and asking him to
show me the way to go home.
