1999: Summer of Sport
CRICKET
Time for a bit of Kiwi bashing
After a dismal p e f o r m a n c e in the World
Cup, England will be looking to b o u n c e
back against surprise semi-finalists N e w
Zealand in the four-match Test series
this s u m m e r .
Definitely with a n e w c o a c h (prob-
ably G l a m o r g a n c o a c h D u n c a n
Fletcher) a n d possibly with a n e w cap-
tain (Nasser H u s s a i n or M a r k Ram-
prakash), England n e e d to put u p a
g o o d s h o w i n g against o f t h e only 2
(out o f 8 others) test sides that can b e
classed b e l o w t h e m .
W h e n y o u look at t h e t e a m that is
actually available, it is hard to s e e h o w
they couid have d o n e s o badly in t h e
World C u p .
Look for Aian Mullally, Darren
G o u g h a n d Alex Tudor to lead the bowl-
ing, a n d G r a h a m Thorpe, M a r k Ram-
praksh a n d M a r k Butcher t h e batting.
The selectors n e e d to find a n o t h e r
opener if M i k e Atherton's back hasn't
h e a l e d , a n d they n e e d t o d e c i d e
w h e t h e r they w a n t to u s e B e n Hol-
lioake, or A n d r e w Flintoff or neither as
the n u m b r e 6/allrounder position.
A l e c Stewart probably w o n ' t b e
k e e p i n g a n y m o r e , so expect either
Paul Nixon(Leics) or p r o s p e c t Chris
Read(Notts) to b e b e h i n d t h e stumps.
With regard to N e w Zealand, they
have a g o o d b o w l i n g attack with t h e
hostile S i m o n Doull, t h e World Cup's
leading wicket taker G e o f f Allot, a n d
y o u n g left a r m spinner Daniel Vettorl
(think milkybar kid - that's w h o h e looks
like).
There batting, however, is m u c h
weaker. Only captain Stephen Fleming
is really u p to international standard, all
t h o u g h ex-Warwickshire Roger Twose
may m a k e his mark back in England.
H o p e f u l l y t h o u g h E n g l a n d s u p -
porters should have something to smile
a b o u t - b e f o r e t h e winter in South
Africa...
Key Dates:
July 1-5: 1st Test, Edgbaston
July 22-26: 2 n d Test, Lord's
August 5-9: 3rd Test, O l d Trafford
August 19-23: 4th Test, The Oval
MOTOR RACING
Ferrari v McClaren
- again
We are m i d w a y t h r o u g h t h e f o r m u l a
o n e season, a n d already it looks like
being the s a m e race as last year - Fer-
rari versus M c C L a r e n .
But this writer isn't c o m p l a i n i n g ,
especially if w e get a race as exciting
as the o n e in C a n a d a 10 days or s o
ago. It o n c e again c o m e s d o w n to
w h o has t h e m o r e reliable, better
machine, as always. The Ferrari is get-
ting better all the t i m e a n d it looks a
t o u g h ask for M c C l a r e n to keep u p .
But every l i m e that M c C l a r e n look
like they're failing b e h i n d , they catch
up again.
I can't really s e e w h i c h w a y this
race is g o i n g to g o , but I k n o w that
I'll b e w a t c h i n g . Especially t h e start
at Belgium, after last years pile-up.
There is s o m e t h i n g quite satisfy-
ing about s e e i n g a d o z e n or s o multi
million p o u n d cars get trashed
Look for recent retiree D a m o n
Hill to try a n d g o o u t with a bang-
rather than a w h i m p e r .

TENNIS
Catch the Beeb's
only sport ,
People interested in tennis all of a

(which kicked off o n M o n d a y ) , the
two w e e k s of t h e year w h e n every-
o n e suddenly r e m e m b e r s what ten-
nis is.
Tim H e n m a n is the British h o p e
in the men's, w h i c h m a y b e w o n by
Pete Sampras (again). G r e g Rused-
ski m a y put u p a challenge, but I
can't s e e h i m w i n n i n g it. Look for
H e n a m n to crash a n d burn in the
semis
In the w o m e n ' s bad loser Mar-
tina Hingis will p r o b a b l y b e t h e
favourite, but s h e will have to watch
out for Steffi Graf, w h o appears to
be having s o m e w h a t o f a renais-
sance, the Williams sisters a n d A n n a
Kornakova, a m o n g s t others.
All that's left o f sport o n the

FOOTBALL
Kev's scramble for Euro 2000
After despertley dull p e r f o r m a n c e s by
England against the likes o f S w e d e n
andlowly Bulgatia, Kevin Keegan needs
to prove w h y h e w a s worth prising
away f r o m M o h a m m e d Al-Fayed a n d
Fulham.
Admittedly h e did not have a full
squad at the e n d o f a l o n g English sea-
son, but the performance needs to b e
lifted significantly if England are to w i n
in Poland in September.
Hopefully by that stage they will
have a c o n v i n c i n g w i n against Lux-
e m b o u r g under t h e belts. England
n e e d to w i n against Poland to m a k e
sure thay they can get t h r o u g h to t h e
playoffs. So e v e n t h e n they d o n ' t
g u a r e n t e e qualification. Admittedly
y o u c a n n o t b l a m e K e e g a n entirely
b e c a u s e t h e q u a l i f i c a t i o n p r o c e s s
started under t h e then slightly m a d
G l e n n H o d d l e a n d w a s far t o o s o o n
after t h e e n d o f the Wotld C u p .
if K e e g a n has a full s q u a d avail-
able, then t h e potential lineup c o u l d
theoretically b e g o o d e n o u g h to beat
a n y o n e . T h e trick is Keegan needs to
recapture the spirit a n d attacking abil-
ity o f t h e N e w c a s t l e United f r o m a
f e w years b a c k ( R e m e m b e r t h e m ?
They w e r e really exciting a n d t h e n
Kenny Dalglish took over). If he can d o
that then S e a m a n , Southgate, A d a m s
a n d C a m p b e l l c a n take care o f t h e
d e f e n c e .
Euro 2000 qualifcation s h o u l d still
be a realistic possibility for England
a n d questions must b e asked if they,
don't qualify.
The s a m e cannot b e said o f Scot-
land, w h o , after drawing with the Faroe
Islands (the Faroe Islands?!?!), will b e
hard p u s h e d to qualify. N o t that it
w o u l d matter - w e all k n o w they w o u l d
g o o u t in t h e first round if they did
qualify....
Key dates:
4 Sept: England v L u x e m b o u r g ; Bosnia
v Scotland;
8: Poland v England; Estonia v Scotland
GOLF
Europe goes for
hatrick
Just before the b e g i n n i n g of term is
the biggest event in golf - the bian-
nual Rydet C u p . E u r o p e will b e
going for a third successive win, hav-
ing succesfully d e f e n d e d t h e c u p in
V a l d e r a m a last time.
Nick Faldo will probabl.y not b e
in t h e t e a m , but Europe still has a
strong lineup with players such as
Colin M o n t g o m e r i e , Lee W e s t w o o d
a n d Darren Clarke.
The A m e r i c a n s , h o w e v e r , are
just as strong with Justin Lenoard,
T o m L e h m a n a n d Tiger W o o d s . It
ought to b e a tight a n d enthralling
contest (rare for golf), but you'll
n e e d a dish to watch it.
Before then there are t h e last
two majors of Ihe yearfthe US O p e n
finished o n Sunday), in w h i c h Coiin
M o n g o m e r i e will probably c h o k e -
again.
Key Dates:

August 12-15 U S P G A ( M e d i n a h )
Sept. 24-26: Rydet C u p (Brookline)
CYCLING
Le Tour fights
back
Last year t h e rider d o p i n g scandal
ruined the Tour d e France, a n d e n d e d
the careers o f several high profile rid-

process t h e m a g i c o f t h e gruelling

tered. N o longer will p e o p l e a s s u m e
that the blokes w h o can ride 200 miles
a d a y for three w e e k s are t o p class
athletes with outstanding ability, but
the majority s e e m to b e just that.
In t h e m e s s that b e c a m e last

forget that M a r c o Pantani b e c a m e
