pressures of food blogging and

under her own terms.
T
wo years into this
half-university-
student-half-food-
blogger life of mine
and I already have
a lifetime’s worth
of cringe worthy moments –
mostly encountered during
blogger events and restaurant
invites. Imagine: turning up to
the door of a launch event to
know that my name had never
been added to the guest
list. Or wandering around a
party, hand sweating holding
a glass of champagne, not
knowing anyone there and
no-one knowing who I am.
Oh oh oh! Receiving the bill
from a poker-faced waitress
to find that supposedly
complimentary tasting costed
more than two weeks of my
allowance.
Something I’ve missed from
this double life is being able
to visit restaurants without all
the pressure of getting the
best photos, the best seat in
the house, the best flat-lay
shot under the most perfect
natural light, or even having
to chose who to take with me
on the basis of nice hands
and a good appetite (you
know, someone to finish the
food AND volunteer as a
hand model). While receiving
invites to new restaurants
is something I’m very, very
grateful for, and something
that definitely helped me get
out of my comfort zone, I still
want to be able to grasp the
freedom to explore the food
scene outside of my own
personal tastes.
So last week I decided
to pop down to the newly
opened XU for lunch on
my own. XU is a Taiwanese
restaurant created by the
amazing people behind
BAO which in turn is known
for its minimalist, artistic kick
and its creative baos and
Taiwanese snacks. Its vibe has
been impossible to replicate
in the London food scene.
XU retains that artsy flair but
with a twist. Walking into
the two-story restaurant on
Rupert Street is like walking
onto the set of a period film;
the wooden fans swirling on
the ceiling, the pink chairs,
the wooden framed bar –
that classy, opulent interior
reminiscent of the 1920s.
“All I need right now is a
Qipao”, I think as I stare
blankly at the waiter in his
black suit and bow tie, my
hands stroking the creases
of my rather modern white
blouse.
I am seated on the first floor,
at a table tucked in the back

beautiful addition to the London
with one chair, conveniently
designed for lone diners like
myself. Not long after that, I
am presented with a menu.
BAO is known for its creative,
tea-based drinks, and they
explore their mixological
combinations even further
at XU with a whole range of
creations, including XU’s Gin
& Tonic, a gin infused with
tea leaves. Naturally, I think
2 pm is not at all early for a
drink, so I go for a Lo Tsui Ke,
a sweet mix of Hong Yu Tea,
Gin, white miso and apple.
I’ve done my research thor-
oughly before coming, and
order the lunch menu which
pleasantly provides me with a
taster of a few dishes without
breaking the bank. It includes
a snack, a choice of starters,
one main plus a bowl of rice
and greens.
The lotus chips arrive as
a snack. Thin slices of lotus
root are fried and seasoned
with chilli, peanut and winter
melon syrup. The crunchy
texture and the savoury
sweetness of this dish make
The starters arrive next.
I went for the tomato and
smoked eel out of the three
options available in the lunch
menu. Cubes of tender fish
are mixed with juicy tomato
chunks, all in an appetising
vinegary, spicy dressing.
I also order the taro
dumplings as an extra. Three
plump, glossy pyramids sat
on a pool of green kow choi
oil dressing, with a chunk of
iconic sweet and salty Taiwan-
ese sausage wrapped inside
chewy taro skin. They’re
delicious.
The mains take me by
surprise – the portion sizes
are far more generous than
I expected. A whole portion
of their signature Shou Pa
Chicken arrive with a dish of
seasonal greens (my favourite
Choi Sum) and a bowl of
steamed Chi Shiang rice.
The waitress kindly explains
it the perfect bar snack – I’d
happily return to the bar for
a few cocktails over a few
bowls of these.
the Shou Pa Chicken: mar-
inated chicken with ginger
and spring onion with a white
pepper and chicken skin dip.
I am advised to give the bowl
a gentle mix before diving in.
The drippings and sauce coat
the tender strips of meat, with
the ginger and spring onion
tying all the flavours together.
This dish goes perfectly with
the rice – the flavours and
simplicity of this dish trans-
porting me back to my home
in Hong Kong. it feels oh so
familiar and oh so homey.
Halfway through the
Show Pa Chicken and I and
absolutely stuffed. Luckily the
waiter offers me a special da
bao – my Chinese roots just
won’t accept any food wast-
age. (My mother would have
slapped me for not finishing
the rice.)
Verdict. Absolutely delicious
food, sincere service, won-
derful to see the BAO family
expand so successfully. I’d
definitely come back again
for lunch – I’m eyeing their
signature Bak Kwa (meat
jerky) and Char Siu Iberico
Pork!

Andrada’s trans-European culinary summer
Are you dying to leave London? Are you getting on the
first bus, train, plane, boat, submarine out of this country
first chance you get? Are 90% of your choices motivated
by hunger? Andrada Balmez will be your guide through
Southern Europe (and also Poland for some reason). Take
her hand (and some cutlery and eat your summer away!
B
elieve it or not,
this is the last food
tip of the year –
and it makes me
feel both sad and
relieved. Because
there is no dish that’s really
good enough to celebrate the
end of the year, the promise
of summer and freedom, I
decided to create the perfect
trans-European food itinerary
for you.
If you have the time and
money to travel a little bit I
highly recommend it, if for
no other reason, just to get
rid of all that exam stress
(if you had any, of course).
Though realistically none of
you will actually embark on
Andrada’s culinary adventure
across Europe, if you do
travel I do advise you to make
the best out of it and eat
something you are unlikely to
find in London. Like afforda-
ble housing or something I
don’t know.
First stop, Italy. Admittedly,
Italy is a lovely summer
destination and while Rome
might be one of the more
popular pit stops, it is far from
my favourite. If you happen
to pass through, try not to
miss the Quinto quarto – just
because Rome is the home of
this dish – and if la pajata is
a bit too much for you (I will
admit that intestines served
with tomato based sauce and
rigatoni is not for everyone),
you should definitely try coda
alla vaccinara! For renais-
sance geeks I recommend
bistecca alla fiorentina – a
renowned beefsteak found in
Florence – totally delicious.
My favourite thing about
Italy is that no matter where
you go you will find a wine,
cheese, steak and dessert
specific to the location you’ll
find yourself in. So keep an
eye out for those rare local
delicacies!
My next stop is France. And
France is pretty damn nice if
you avoid the big cities, with
their boiling hot temperatures
and hoardes of tourists. Feel
free to ignore my advice if
you’re feeling great and want
to fight with legions of tourists
for the best picture with the
Mona Lisa, or for a waiter’s
attention in a restaurant. If
you’re not up for that, try a
nice small village and sample
some local food. French
local delicacies are great,
everywhere, or at least,
everywhere I went. I know
you know to try the famous
Ratatouille, the foie gras, truf-
fles,and cheese and wine. Try
to refrain from binge drinking
fine wines to drown the pain
that comes with failing your
exams. Unless you need the
extra tipple to feel brave and
try some escargots! The name
might sound scary/fancy, but
they are only snails. They are
worth trying at least once,
and, if you’re still feeling it,
try some quenelles – they’re
just dumplings, promise..
Because you probably want
to spend your summer in a
nice sunny warm place –
definitely not because I have

no idea about what people
in Nordic countries eat – let’s
move on to Spain. If you feel
like having the blood of a
suckling pig or lamb on your
hands, go to Segovia and
try Cochinillo asado (I’ve
heard that they also have
some nice… art (?) landmarks
(?) cultural events (?) worth
seeing, but don’t quote me,
I just care about the food).
Even if your trip does not
include this destination, it’s
well worth the detour! If you
love seafood, don’t hesitate
to order some gambas al
ajillo – and this comes from
someone who is not a huge
fan of prawns. Because you
are cultured and have proba-
bly met at least one Spanish
Erasmus student by now, I’m
sure you’ll try paella and
tortilla espanola without me
recommending it.
Final and perhaps surprising
destination: Poland. I’m
planning on visiting soon
and I’ll share with you all
the dishes I’ll be trying
(you’re welcome). Although
I obviously disagree with the
scorn often exhibited towards
Eastern Europe, I know that
few people know or appre-
ciate the cuisine – except for
maybe borsch and …uhm…
vodka. Unless of course
they’re Eastern Europeans. So
I will try and keep it short. If
you happen to be in Poland
this summer, definitely try
some pierogi. I was told that
anything you buy anywhere
else in the world is just a very
sad version of an authentic
Polish pierogi. Also on my
to-do list: grilled oscypek and
apple with bacon and cran-
berry sauce, sernik – because
there is never enough cheese-
cake – golabki and mazurka.
I have faith in you and I
know that wherever you’re
planning on going, you’ll be
able to find some amazing
food. Sure, if you search
enough you can find pretty
much anything in London. But,
and this is a big but, you can
only try the authentic dishes
in their birthplaces. Not to
mention they’re probably a
lot cheaper in their country of
origin.
So travel safe, eat well, and
return with your tummies and
batteries full.
