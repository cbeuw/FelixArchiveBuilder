Abuse is
not a valid

I
've been writing and
editing Comment for
felix for years, and it’s
my strongly held opinion
that a student newspaper
without opinion is not a
student newspaper worth
having. University is a time
when we’re all growing up,
finding ourselves and forming
our beliefs, and a huge part of
this process is a lot of active
consideration of everything
we thought we knew. Trust me,
I've really been dragging this
process out: I've been here for
nearly a decade.
I write Comment in pursuit of
wider discussion. I'm open to
having my opinions changed
– as has happened many times
– and I'm equally happy for
someone to form an opposite
view to mine. I choose to write
about things that are worthy
of discussion, regardless of
anyone’s take on them.
I've run the Comment section
of felix such that no one would
ever be personally targeted.
Regardless of whether an
article was about someone’s
actions or in response to
their ideas, I firmly believe
that it should not be a
personal attack. Anyone can
write Comment – the only
qualification you need is to
have an opinion – but as a
good Comment writer, you
often write in a deliberately
inflammatory way, making
your opinions seem far more
controversial than they are.
After all, no one wants to read
their own bland views echoed
thousands of times around
campus.
As a result of this, a lot of
my articles are commented
on, and I'm often sent emails
or challenged to discussion.
I welcome this: engagement
with the ideas is my aim. I
don’t write from a narcissistic
desire to see my name in print,
or because I think I have the
ultimate final say on a topic.
However, until this year,
I’d never felt that it was me
personally being attacked,
only the opinions that I’d put on
paper. If I made typos or did
a poor job of editing, it didn't
really have any impact on the
way the content was received,
because the production of felix
is not expected to be the same
as a mainstream newspaper.
Pointing out typos has always
been fun, of course, but in all
my years at Imperial I've never
seen it used as an argument to
degrade the content until this
year.
I, like many others, give up
huge amounts of time to make
sure that felix is run smoothly
and all submitted content from
students is developed such that
it can be brought to fruition in
print. Along with dozens of
other volunteers and a full time
editor (whose working hours,
year on year, regularly exceed
60 or 70 or 80 hours a week)
I spend many, many hours in
a basement poring over style
guides and InDesign files, fact-
checking and editing content.
It's never perfect, but that
doesn’t matter. I'm incredibly
proud of every article that
goes to print, whether it's the
Music section, Sport, or Clubs
and Societies; whether it was
written by me, someone I
know, or someone I’ve never
heard of.
I have put my heart and soul
into felix for years, and I am
incredibly protective of the
paper and the people who
dedicate their time to making
it. I absolutely condemn
anyone who does not respect
the work this takes, and who
dismisses and degrades the
content that we – untrained
volunteers – create for the
student body, whether they
do so as part of a personal
vendetta or a superiority
complex manifesting as a lack
of empathy and disregard for
the very real humans who are
behind the words.
Sadly, this is what has
happened this year, and
through various media I
feel that as a result of my
association with felix, I, along
with others, am being unfairly
criticised, attacked, and
dragged into petty arguments
that I have no involvement in.
This is abhorrent and I cast
incredibly strong aspersions
on anyone who thinks that
it is appropriate to (without
evidence) attack the many
for fear of directly criticising
the few. A fear that, perhaps,
personal struggles that formed
those articles. Frankly, that is
rude and uncalled for.
The felix office has become
my home and the people
involved have become
my family. Contrary to
popular belief, we’re not an
echo chamber. We’re an
opinionated, argumentative
group with a vast array of
experiences, ideas, and
political affiliations. I'm
proud to have been involved
with felix for so long, and to
have had the opportunity
to have been shaped by my
interactions with hundreds
of people who are brought
together by a mutual respect
and a desire to create and
share ideas.
Years of editing Comment
have trained me to respect
all opinions and to consider
things from a neutral
perspective. I believe that
opinion can change the
world, but unwarranted and
unconstructive hate is not a
valid opinion. It is a personal
attack, and it is not something
that I will fail to condemn in
my student newspaper nor
elsewhere at my university. By
all means, I would encourage
everyone to raise any concerns
in an appropriate and
respectful way, but it is never
appropriate to use a grudge
as an excuse to make malicious
attacks on uninvolved students.
I hope whoever takes up the
torch at felix next year feels
the same way, so that we can
have an engaging dialogue
while ensuring that discussions
don’t needlessly deteriorate
into unprovoked attacks.
could be well justified, if vague
unsubstantiated insults are the
the only critique that can be
provided.
Some of our articles are
incredibly well written, and
take a lot of work. This year we
had three articles shortlisted
for the Student Publication
Association Awards –
including two of mine – while
one of our members was
shortlisted for Best Reporter.
This while competing against
thousands of entries from
students all over the country.
Most of these students study
Journalism or English and are
trained to structure and colour
their writing, training that we
do not have. Our success is
a huge achievement that I
am immensely proud of. For
me personally, writing and
later preparing one of my
shortlisted articles for entry
was extremely traumatic and
I am indebted to the rest of
the felix team for supporting
me through the process that I
put myself through because it
was an incredibly important
story to tell. To generically
denigrate our achievements is
to diminish the work of many
who worked hard on their
entries and is to dismiss the
often powerful stories and
