Sport to be reshuffled next year
James Cox tells us what he’s got in store for Sport at Imperial Abigail de Bruin
S
ince about
January, there
have been
rumblings in the
Union of a big
sports shake-up.
We got in touch with James
Cox, current Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies) to see
what’s happening now that
things are pretty much ready
to be openly discussed. It
appears we are set to go
into a full year of student
consultation and decision-
making regarding some very
big changes in how Imperial
College Union and Sport
Imperial will work together to
accommodate student sport.
AccordingtoCox,bythestart
of the 2018 academic year
club sport will be delivered
under one banner in one
place on campus. “This aims
to solve the root cause of a
large proportion of our issues
surrounding sport at Imperial,
namely communication
and transparency over
decisions and the complexity
of processes,” he says.
“Throughout next year, there
will be a transitional process
to achieve this”
The history of the relationship
between Sport Imperial,
Imperial College Union, and
student sport societies has
certainly been a rocky one.
The Varsity incident, and
subsequent research into our
institutional culture, have
highlighted inherent sexist
structures. There has also
been a variety of issues with
transparency around certain
processes, including funding
and facilities, seeing many
students frustrated by the
lack of clarity. As Cox says,
“anyone involved in sports’
committees understands that
running their club can be a
challenge under the current
structure; tackling this is one of
the reasons I ran for DPCS in
the first place.”
The Union recently sent out
a survey to students to gauge
their experience with Sport
Imperial. The comments that
poured in have not exactly
painted the best picture of the
organisation.
“Sport Imperial have
consistently made me feel like
my team or sport was not a
priority, by failing to provide
basicprovisionssuchaspitches
for matches, failing to provide
sufficient information, and by
running campaigns that have
been offensive and unhelpful
to the cause of encouraging
and uplifting women in sport,”
says one exasperated survey
participant who wants to
remain anonymous.
That’s not to say Imperial
College Union has been
faultless in this partnership. A
whole host of issues have come
up over the years as a result
of Union action (or inaction)
including double booking of
training spaces and repeated
issues revolving around the
Union Gym floor coming apart
or the splintering in the Union
Dining Hall (although we are
told the floor is finally due to
be replaced soon).
Now, the Union is finally
working with Sport Imperial
and will hopefully adopt
a multifaceted approach
that will enhance the sport
experience at Imperial. “Sport
Imperial (College) and the
Union (me, Activities) have
been on the same page for
quite some time,” says Cox.
“All parties involved are
incredibly passionate about
achieving the best for the
students regarding sport and
it is very reassuring to work
together with that in mind! We
have worked very closely on
many decisions surrounding
sport this year.”
As far as restructures are
concerned, Cox has been
looking for solutions in other
student unions. A trip to Bath
in March yielded particular
insights. Though it’s a common
occurrence for other student
unions to have athletics unions,
where sports and societies are
split Cox doesn’t think this is a
system fit for Imperial. Instead
he’s pushing for a more
student-led system.
Indeed, Imperial is renowned
for the breadth of student-
led activities it provides.
Other Universities tend to
have fewer clubs with wider
scopes of activities, but Cox
reassures us that we won’t see
the merging of clubs to reduce
administration burdens. “To
thrust an extra five teams
into one club for one student
to run would be silly in terms
of managing people and
finances,” says Cox. “Besides,
this would completely
disregard the years of history
and tradition we have built
at Imperial. Imperial doesn’t
have a tendency to copy
others, we’ll create something
ourselves and it will be better.”
So what’s next? Obviously a
key difficulty with the projects
of Officer Trustees is that for
them to be completed, they
often have to be picked up by
the incoming officer. Only time
will tell how effective the vitally
important student consultation
part of this project will be.
But Cox doesn’t think that’s
necessarily enough. “To make
this a success, all students
need to get involved with
consultations next year when
they come, so stay on the ball
(yep, intended). If it [the new
system] is created by students
and for students, it will be
heralded by all students, don’t
underestimate this [sic].”

College gets collection points for
Grenfell Tower fire victims

F
ollowing the fire
that engulfed
Grenfell Tower in
the early hours
last Wednesday,
claiming 17 lives
and injuring many more,
some critically, Imperial
College set up clothes and
bedding donation points at
the main entrance to the South
Kensington campus and in
White City at the Grdpad
Wood Lane Studios.
A statement released on
Imperial’s website wrote:
”Our thoughts are with those
affected by the fire at Grenfell
Tower. The residents are our
neighbours and community.
We are deeply saddened by
the incident and determined to
help where we can.
We are working with local
councillors and the community
to provide support, including
accommodation.”
Thanks to the efforts of
Londoners over the past two
days, Imperial is no longer
collecting item donations.
However monetary donations
are more than welcome. You
can donate at The Borough
of Kensington and Chelsea’s
dedicatedwebsite,theEvening
Standard and The Kensington
and Chelsea Foundation.
The A40 Westway has
reopened, but some local
roads remain closed, so
congestion are high. Tube
service has resumed.
