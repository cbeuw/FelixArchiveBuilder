Jonathan Masters
discusses grief, guilt,
and mental health
A
few weeks ago
I finally came
to the end
of my three
year course at
Imperial, and
although it is a cliché, the
time has simply flown by. As I
handed in the final final final
draft of my undergraduate
dissertation into turnitin, I
suddenly burst into tears.
Now it could have been a
combination of the fact I had
just made the deadline and
the stress that was associated
with that, but my thoughts
immediately went to the path
that had led me to this point.
This was triggered by a song
called Carissa by Sun Kil
Moon that had popped up
through the shuffle function on
my Spotify, but it sent me right
back to the period of time
during my first year with the
death of my roommate.
I had known Georg for four
months at that point, and
whilst there are many stories
of roommates despising each
other in their first year, our
relationship was not that. We
immediately became very
close and got on very well.
We both had little quirks that
annoyed each other: for me
it was how he was always
working hard, making me
feel guilty by extension; and
for him I’m well aware that
my messiness annoyed him
greatly. We talked about
our lives and dreams, and
relationships. I felt as though
I could tell him anything and I
thought he felt the same way
which is why to this day it
makes no sense to me why on
the 3rd
of March, 2015, he fell
from our bedroom window
whilst I was having breakfast.
To clarify, the coroner’s
report stated that there was
not sufficient evidence to con-
clusively say it was suicide,
but I have thought about the
events of that day, every day
for the past three years, and
I cannot think of any other
explanation. I also found a
note on his desk suggesting
these thoughts, although
it must be stated that this
handwriting could not be con-
firmed to be 100% his. It’s not
difficult to find the reports – I
occasionally google his name
to see if there is anything else
written about him, and I know
I’m mentioned in an article
somewhere in relation to it.
After the ambulance
came, the police spoke to
me to make sure I had no
involvement in his death. I
walked to classes because I
couldn’t stay in that building
any longer. I remember just a
sense of complete numbness
that didn’t stop until the
evening when we had a hall
meeting – where I cried for
hours. I spent much of that
day trying to think of the best
positive outcome. His injuries
would be serious, but maybe
he would survive.
The following day I went
to St Mary’s hospital to see
him in the Intensive Care
Unit where I met his family
for the first time. I waited in
the waiting area for a few
minutes before his father
came out and explained to
me with slow and considered
words that Georg would
never be the same again, and
that the brain injuries he had
sustained were life changing.
I went in to see him. Both his
legs were in casts, he was
breathing through a ventila-
tor, he had more tubes going
into him than I could count,
and his face was unrecog-
nisable from the fall. I said
goodbye to him and left the
hospital to phone my parents,
who I hadn’t said anything to.
I burst into tears once again,
and my mum said she would
come to pick me up and take
me home.
He died a few days later on
the 7th
of March whilst I was
at home trying to block the
whole event out of my head,
and I returned back to halls
to be told by his grieving
parents and brother. I don’t
really remember much from
that time until I went to Berlin
for a week for his funeral. I
can never thank his parents
enough for the kindness and
hospitality that they gave
me in the darkest time of
their lives, but guilt lingered
throughout that entire trip,
and to an extent it still does.
Despite me confessing this to
so many people, there is still
the idea at the back of my
mind that I could have done
more. I could have noticed
earlier. I could have told him
about my depression. Maybe
he would have opened up
to me and we could have
worked through it together.
Maybe it was nothing related
to mental illness at all. A
million maybes come up when
I think about that year, but not
enough answers.
I still maintain a friend-
ship with his parents and
his brother, partially out of
a sense of duty, but mostly
because I genuinely really
like them. I had the strangest
thought this year that I have
known them longer than I
ever knew Georg, and yet it
still feels like he is the one that
I am trying to make this up to.
Whenever I go to Berlin I take
the tram to the outskirts of
town and visit his grave, and
whilst it is odd to be 21 and
visiting graves of people I
once knew, I will forever have
this sense of duty towards
him. I talk occasionally to
his brother and parents and
exchange holiday greetings;
however, sometimes I think
perhaps I am a chapter of
their lives they would rather
forget. If that is the case, then
I wish them no ill will and will
always be thankful for their
patience.
Recently I lost my wallet
which had a passport photo
of him inside, and when I lost
it, it felt that perhaps it was
time that I stopped grieving
for him. To stop grieving is not
to forget, but to live your life
without their death impinging
on your life. I miss him every-
day, but he made a decision
that can not be changed. For
months afterwards I tried to
console myself with thoughts
such him dying young, meant
that he would never have to
see anyone close to him die,
that he would never have to
go through anymore pain,
but as I reflect back on those
ideas, they seem false.
If you ever feel like life is
not worth living, take time
out. Go back home. Seek
help from other people. If
you ever feel like you are
too stressed and upset to
continue, talk to someone,
take a year out, university
can always wait. If you ever
feel like you have nobody to
talk to, I can guarantee there
is always someone out there
who would rather listen to
you cry than have to go to
your funeral.
Georg was 20 years old,
he had a passion and a talent
for computing, and he was
my friend whom I miss every
day.
