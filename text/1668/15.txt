Master of

T
wo years ago,
comedian Aziz
Ansari debuted
his Netflix original
series, Master
of None. The
show proved to be a critical
darling, charming viewers
with its mix of insightfulness,
comedy, and genuineness.
After its stellar first season,
the series took a one year
break; only recently did it
return to Netflix for a second
round.
We pick up shortly after
where the finale of the last
season left off, with Dev in
the midst of a pasta-making
apprenticeship in Italy. The
first episode of the season is
a black-and-white homage
to some of the pillars of
Italian cinema. In particular,
the episode itself takes after
the iconic Bicycle Thieves. In
terms of plot, this episode
is relatively basic, however,
its strength comes from its
stylistic choices and how well
it establishes Dev’s new status
quo. In general, this season
has a more measured pace
than its predecessor, with
this more relaxed approach
matching the backdrop of
rural Italy. The first fifth of
the series is spent in Italy,
before returning once more to
New York, where again Dev
attempts to piece together
his personal and professional
lives.
Once again, Ansari’s
approach to the series feels
very auteur-esque, as each
episode has its own unique
feel. As before, the episodes
tend to focus on one topic
each, whilst still moving
forward the central plotlines.
This time, Ansari casts the net
even wider, opting to cover
topics such as religion, Tinder,
and sexuality. As the series
progresses, there is also a

greater diversification of view
points. Much of this season
focusses on the experiences
and struggles of other charac-
ters, not just the protagonist
Dev.
This comes as little sur-
prise given that Ansari has
expressed his exhaustion
with the series, indicating
there isn’t much more that
he has left to say about his
own perspective. This almost
vignette-like approach helps
keep the series fresh, and
perhaps offers an avenue
for the show to continue in
future. Nowhere is this more
evident than the season’s
sixth episode, New York, I
Love You, which opts to show
us glimpses into the lives of
a diverse collection of New
Yorkers. The episode is an
excellent example of Ansari’s
wholehearted commitment
to representation. In a single
episode we’re taken through
the homes of Manhattan’s
elite and the people who
work for them, we’re treated
to a beautiful silent segment
that gives us a peak into the
lives of deaf protagonists,
and we’re taken for a ride
in the cabs of New York’s
migrant taxi drivers. All
these themes are masterfully
expanded and brought back
together as the episode ends.
These diversions, one could
argue, are more powerful
than Dev’s story over the
season. His main narrative
arc over the season is a
typical, albeit well-executed,
romance plot-line. It even
ends with a slightly cliché,
although again quite apt,

ate-style conclusion. This
is contrast to, for example,
the powerful Thanksgiving
episode, which deals with
Dev’s friend Denise, who’s
struggling to be accepted as
a lesbian by her family.
Ansari’s humour shines
as bright as ever, and on
the whole actually sees a
marked improvement since
last season. Some of his more
exaggerated mannerisms and
jokes are downplayed, which

makes Dev’s interactions feel
a lot more real. Of course,
there are still some cheesy
moments at points, but these
do not detract from the
narrative. The performances
throughout the season are
excellent, with new introduc-
tions capably matching up
to old favourites. As usual,
however, it is Aziz’s father
who provides some of the
stand-out segments of the
show.
A great strength of the
series has always been its
soundtrack, and that is a
trend that continues here.
It deftly blends together
everything from Tupac to 60s
baroque-pop in a way that
accentuates the setting
and mood of a scene.
In many ways,
Master of None
feels like a
modern-day
On the Road.
It excellently
codifies much of
the aimless and
wistful wandering
people experience
through their 20s
and 30s, and it offers
sober if optimistic looks
at many of the issues of our
time. It is sure to go down as
one of the year’s, if not the
decade’s, best shows.
