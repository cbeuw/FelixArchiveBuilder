Swet Shop Boys | Rap heroes of our time
welcoming refugees. “Well
you know about Aeneas in
the Iliad/Fled Turkey and he
just founded Rome/What if he
had drowned in a boat?”
First in their self-titled EP
released in 2014, then in last
year’s Cashmere, and now
again, in Sufi La, released in
February this year, the duo
has consistently produced
work that dissects the
experience of belonging to
the South-Asian diaspora.
Their tracks cover swathes of
ground, speaking lucidly on
themes as heavy as institu-
tional racism, skin bleaching,
and the pressure to choose
technical careers and goofing
off in up-beat bangers that
name-check everything from
the Maruti cars ubiquitous on
Delhi roads, to the Bollywood
actress Madhuri Dixit, the
moreish mango drink Frooti.
Cashmere was in many
ways the perfect Swet Shop
Boys manifesto, track after
track hit the mark, from call-
ing out airport authorities and
their racially driven ‘random
searches’ – “Always get a
random check when I rock
the stubble” in the opening
T5, to the outrageously good
Half Moghul, Half Mowgli,

Ahmed tries to square the
bravado necessary in the rap
game with his South-Asian
heritage “These kids want to
O
n the first
of June,
midway
through
his set, Riz

signalled for the sold-out
crowd at Scala to quiet
down. Leaning in close,
unaccompanied by music,
he rapped his 2011 single
Sour Times; “Please allow
me to vouch for mine…/
losing my religion to
tomorrow’s headlines”. It had
been exactly a week since
the horrific scenes at the
Manchester Arena, and a
few scant days before more
horrific scenes would play
out barely two miles from the
King’s Cross venue at London
Bridge. “Ain’t religious faith
that’s causing these crimes/
It’s losing faith in democratic
free market designs”
he continued: “there’s a
monopoly on pens that’s
why they forge their own
swords…They’re misguided,
turned violent, strapped
themselves up with bombs/
But they’re still cowards,
‘cause they ain’t here when
the backlash is on.” Many
artists understandably felt the
need to say something after
these attacks, coming from
Ahmed it feels particularly
poignant. He along with the
rapper Heems, the other half
of Swet Shop Boys, has made
a career of creating politically
conscious music that doesn’t
shy away from tackling issues
of religion and race.
Riz Ahmed (a.k.a. Ric
MC) of Rogue One fame, is
a Muslim British Pakistani,
Heems (previously of Das
Racist) is American Indian,
and Hindu. In Swet Shop
Boys, the two complement
each other as they trade bars
over the tabla and shehnai-
heavy classical Indian
inspired beats produced
by Redinho. Heems, who
at times seems so mellow
that he appears moments
from a weed-induced nap,
is smoothly charismatic.
He archly delivers his lines
“I’m so fly, bitch/but I’m on
a no-fly list” which mask
their bite with humour. Riz
by contrast, is lightning
fast. Spitting bars that draw
inspiration from the grime
scene of his London youth,
he brings a self-aware aca-
demic tone, going as far as
to invoke Virgil and Homer
as a defence in a case for
Shop Boys have shown they
can be light-hearted and yet
still be powerful, in Cashmere,
in a track named after the
(erstwhile) One Direction star,
Riz addresses boys like his
nephew, praying they won’t
be radicalised by the “hating
and the news and all the shit
they sanitize” – “look Zayn
Malik’s got more than eighty
virgins on him/There’s more
than one direction to get to
paradise”.
Generations of kids growing
up not sure of their place in
the world have found a voice
that speaks to and for them in
rap and grime. Riz pays trib-
ute the effect that American
stars had on his own life in
Half Mughal Half Mowgli –
“My only heroes were black
rappers/So to me 2Pac was
a true Paki”. Now Riz and
Heems have the opportunity
to be mentors themselves and
provide hope for the gen-
eration that has come after
them. It’s a responsibility they
appear not to take lightly, for
all their righteous anger and
irreverence, the music that
Swet Shop Boys produce is
an earnest, and sometimes
tender call to the disaffected
youth of the communities they
represent. “They comin’ for
the culture man, like they was
on a mission” raps Heems in
Din-e-Ilahi, the last track on
Cashmere; “Used to hate the
clothes, they ask where’d I get
the stitchin’/Used to call me
curry, now they cook it in the
kitchen”, voice cracking and
hoarse, the Riz takes over; “
it’s difficult when you’re raised
to hate yourself/And look in
the mirror, and dye yourself,
and it deflates your health”,
he takes deep breath, “you
can’t escape yourself, please
love yourself”.
In this brave new world in
which grime MCs are wot
(nearly) won the election,
Swet Shop Boys have a real
opportunity to make an
impact, they should whole-
heartedly embrace it.
be moguls/But they’re eyes
fame, paper and hoes/But I’m
descend from Mughals/So
I’m just trying to find my way
home”, to praise of the mul-
ti-ethnic NHS in Din-e-Ilahi.
In Sufi-La they seem to have,
if not quite lost their bite, cer-
tainly shifted their focus.
Though some lines echo
Cashmere’s incisive commen-
tary “Tours sold out but I ain’t
got a visa/I was so sweet at
the embassy, but I shouldn’t
have worn a keffiyeh” sings
Riz in Need Moor, later
hitting out at Trump’s America
“More of a star, earned
more stripes/But the stars
and stripes have got less
tolerance”, on the whole, the
rest of the album, reverts to
the rap stable of discussing
women and money.
That doesn’t mean the
album is a dud, the beats
are as gorgeous as ever,
Anthem and Thas My Girl are
both compulsively listenable,
but it’s easy to imagine the
whole new EP as the tracks
that didn’t quite make the
grade for Cashmere; the lines
ramble, the focus is off, tracks
such as Birding bring their
A+ punnage (like plumage,
geddit? Never mind) – “she
don’t like you, she says you
was a peasant/She said I’m
classy like a ring-necked
pheasant” but do little else.
In fact, the whole album
feels like the extended Tiger
Hologram cut, the track which
in Cashmere broke up the pol-
itics with a bizarre riff on the
perils of being short sighted:
“Nah yeah I wear contact
lenses/Nah yeah daily dispos-
ables/Nah you get used to it
it’s minor.”
It’s a shame because Swet
Political, witty, and earnest, Riz MC and Heems are the
transatlantic duo lending disenfranchised South-Asian
kids a voice
