Queer British
Art (1861-1967)
| Ostracised
but never
conquered
L
ittle rainbows have
been popping up
everywhere lately
– on Facebook, in
Skittles adverts, soon
they’ll be arriving
on London’s streets. In fact,
the rainbow flag has been
flying over Tate Britain
for some months now. The
gallery will be kicking off the
London Pride celebrations
next Saturday with a special
Tate Lates at their exhibition
Queer British Art.
The show, focused solely
on LGBTQ+ artists, charts
the century or so between
1861, when the death penalty
for sodomy was abolished,
and 1967, when another bill
decriminalised male homosex-
uality. The works on display
that emerged in this century,
in which artists ran the risk of
trading their freedom for free
expression of their desires,
are a celebration of defiance,
both coded and candid.
The exhibition encompasses
art in its traditional forms –
there are plenty of paintings
here, from John Singer
Sargent’s portrait of Vernon
Lee to David Hockney’s
tongue in cheek art school
paintings of oiled up athletes
from the muscle mags – and
equally, there are plenty of
surprising objects. Amongst
letters, photographs, voice
recordings and masks there’s
a case containing several
library books, swiped from
an Islington library in the mid-
60s by Kenneth Halliwell and
Joe Orton. They borrowed
the books and returned them
with new and improved
covers. One (straight laced)
romance novel called the
Queen’s Favourite sports a
cover of two men about to
have sex, and The Collected
Plays of Emlyn Williams are
retitled Knickers Must Fall and
Fucked by Monty. For every
fun piece like Noel Coward’s
dressing gown, for each
joyful, romantic story like the
one of the painter Duncan
Grant and the poet and novel-
ist Paul Roche who met at the
traffic crossing at Piccadilly
Circus and were together
for 32 years, there are ones
sharp with tragedy.
Simeon Solomon’s 1864
painting of Sappho begins

Queer British Art (1861-1967) is on at Tate Britain until 1st
October
Tickets: Adult £16.50 (without donation
£15), Concession £14.50 (without
donation £13.10)
which, as per pre-Raphaelite
tradition, is wispily roman-
tic, suffused with flattering
soft-focus light, belies the
heartbreak and injustice that
befell the artist; Solomon
was arrested for cottaging,
once in London, and again in
Paris. He spent the last years
of his life in a workhouse,
an alcoholic, abandoned by
his friends. In another room
hangs the lemon yellow
door of the cell in Reading
Gaol in which Oscar Wilde
was imprisoned for gross
indecency.
Some of the works are
explicitly, graphically, queer,
others are little more than
still lifes – quiet, unassum-
ing impressionistic works
with colourful stories. Ethel
Sands' work, belonging to
the aesthetic and impression-
istic naturalism movements
promoted by the famously
sexually liberal Bloomsbury
group, is characteristic. In the
1911 painting Tea with Sickert
we peep over the shoulder
of a woman in a fantastically
orange hat, the table is set
for tea, Sickert reclines in a
chintz chair directly opposite.
The romantic liaison here
does not involve Sickert as
might be assumed, but Sands
and her lover, the woman in
orange, Nan Hudson. This
veneer of a particular sort
of genteel Englishness is rep-
licated in Sand’s The Chintz
Couch in which she picks out
the comfortable interiors of
her home with Hudson in
yellow ochre and pale duck
egg blue.
The Bloomsbury Group
which included Virginia
Woolf (here represented
by a Man Ray photograph)
and her lover Vita Sackville
West (resplendent in a red
hat in a portrait by William
Strang) in many ways form
the lynchpin. Duncan Grant’s
imposing Bathing dominates
the penultimate room. Its
muscular swimmers diving in
choppy waters and hauling
themselves into boats speaks
both of coded desire and the
yearning to find relief from
alienation. “How much I want
to scream sometimes here
for want of being able to say
something I mean,” he wrote
to John Maynard Keynes, life-
long friend and an occasional
lover: “It’s not only that one’s
a sodomite that one has to
hide but one’s whole philoso-
phy of life”. There is little to tie
together the works in Queer
British Art other than the sex-
ualities of the artists involved.
Yet this common thread is
enough. This is a portrayal of
a community from dozens of
different angles, distinctive for
its diversity.
The exhibition does well
to acknowledge that though
great strides have been made
for inclusion there is much still
to be done, even inside the
LGBTQ+ community which
can be just as bound by prej-
udice as the heteronormative
world outside. “I’ve been all
the letters of LGBT and hated
them all” declares Shon Faye
in a blistering video installa-
tion. Intersectionality within
the community with regards
to race is often lacking, and
Sabah Choudrey, a Pakistani
trans activist, draws attention
to this with his commentary on
the theatrical masks created
by Oliver Messel. Many, he
points out, still wear masks of
assimilation in his community
to hide their brownness and
gender identity even when
they come out.
As we move from decrimi-
nalisation to marking other
milestones such as the legali-
sation of same-sex marriage,
hopefully the Tate may be
inspired to curate a new
show showcasing queer art
beyond 1967. With any luck,
they might even include more
queer artists of colour.
Even in its present iteration
this exhibition is to be cele-
brated. Queer British Art is an
ode to artists who have felt
strangers in their own cities
and countries, who despite
being ostracised, demonised,
and criminalised by the wider
society in which they lived,
refused to be silenced, dared
to love fiercely, chose to coun-
ter the hate and suspicion
with which they were treated
with work brimming with joy
and sensuality, wit and pas-
sion. Theirs is a story worth
the telling. As I made my way
around the exhibition I found
myself poring over the stories
behind the works just as much
as over the art on display,
and in the end, what could be
better than that?
