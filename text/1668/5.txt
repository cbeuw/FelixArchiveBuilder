Nutt talks at Psychedelics Studies Imperial
The “niche” society sees successful launch event Joanna Wormald
T
he psychedelic
renaissance is here.
Psychedelic Studies
Imperial launched
their venture last
Wednesday with
a mind-expanding talk by
Professor David Nutt.
Despite initially being told
that psychedelics was too
niche a subject to form a
society around, the PSI has
sprung into life with the aim
of promoting interdisciplinary
psychedelic learning, pulling
together work from scientists,
anthropologists,psychologists,
authors, and artists. Almost
300 people turned up to
hear the legendary Professor
Nutt, author of Drugs Without
the Hot Air and one of the
most important figures in
British science. PSI couldn’t
have chosen a better person
to kick off their series of
events — Professor Nutt
is as entertaining as he is
intellectually fascinating.
Nutt is a powerful speaker
and starts his talk with the bold
statement that psychedelic
consumption by the ancient
Greeks made them feel much
better and allowed them to get
on with the important tasks of
inventing democracy, writing
plays, and “basically founding
Western society”.
Pullingtheaudienceintomore
recent times, Nutt pinpoints
the major breakthrough in
the field of psychedelics:
Albert Hoffman’s synthesis
of LSD for the first time in
1938. He claims this indirectly
revolutionised life sciences:
the development of PCR was
reportedly the result of an LSD
trip in which Kary Mullis saw a
DNA double helix unravelling
and replicating.
Nutt has tried to espouse
the benefits of psychedelics
in psychiatry and help people
give up smoking and alcohol.
He admits that there are
risks of adverse reactions
but explains that when taken
under adequate supervision,
results are “overwhelmingly
positive, safe, and effective.”
Nutt proves his point by
explaining the findings from
more recent research, much
of it his own. Psilocybin (the
psychoactive substance
found in magic mushrooms)
drasticallyimprovedthelivesof
people with severe treatment-
resistant depression. What
is truly astonishing however
is his explanation of how the
drug works. Depression is
typically treated with selective
serotonin re-uptake inhibitors,
which “dampen” activity in
the amygdala (the part of the
brain responsible for fear,
which is commonly over-active
in depression). Psychedelics
seem to do the exact opposite.
Nutt’s theory is that increasing
amygdala activity helps
people confront their emotions
rather than suppress them.
He recounts a moving tale of
one subject who managed
to confront their abusive
father for the first time after
psychedelic treatment.
But what about the more well
known effects of psychedelics?
Nutt thinks he can explain
trips too. His functional MRI
tests show decreased activity
in brain regions associated
with integration in volunteers
injected with psilocybin.
He suggests that this allows
people to see the “primary
processing” that occurs in
the brain. He believes that
this is responsible for the
hallucinations and “ego-
disintegration” during trips.
In future work he hopes to
discover “where people go”
after taking psychedelics
and is confident that at some
point scientists will be able to
visualise what users see by
‘reading’ their brain waves.
By this point the audience is
well and truly on Nutt’s side
and certain of the immense
potential of psychedelics. So
why isn’t the rest ofthe scientific
community clamouring for
more research? The answer
lies in politics and what Nutt
refers to as possibly the
greatest scientific censorship
since the days of Copernicus
and Galileo.
In 1966 the CIA was deeply
concerned about the “drop
acid, not bombs” mentality
of young people and their
reluctance to fight in the
Vietnam War. Nutt speaks
deeply critically of the media
campaigns that ran headlines
such as “LSD made me a
prostitute” and “Doctors
blame LSD/Girl gives birth to
a frog” which helped get LSD
banned and classified in the
UK as a class A drug. He was
even more incensed in 2005
when psilocybin was made
a class A drug. Nutt blames
this on the Daily Mail, which
he accuses of pushing Tony
Blair to take a more “macho”
stance on drugs. He even goes
so far as to declare that this
action was illegal since the
appropriate experts were only
consulted two days before the
vote. It wasn’t all bad though
— Nutt muses that the move
probably provoked him into
doing psychedelics research.
Criminalising psychedelics
\\ Nutt has tried to

has undoubtedly made
research much more difficult
and expensive. Nutt claims
the drugs are treated as
“more dangerous than
plutonium”. He ridicules the
inexorable bureaucracy
that means he can write a
prescription for heroin but
must undergo a police check
and constant supervision to
ensure he doesn’t slip out a
little psilocybin. There has
never been a death caused
by psilocybin, he claims, but
plenty of people die from the
alcoholism that the drug could
help treat.
It is impossible to listen
to Professor Nutt without
becoming convinced
of the benefits of
psychedelic research and
decriminalisation. He thinks
it’s finally time for a rational
and enlightened approach to
drugs policy. He hopes that
political and public debate will
lead to the decriminalisation of
cannabis and then psilocybin.
And if LSD is decriminalised in
Nutt’s lifetime? He’ll take it as
he dies.
