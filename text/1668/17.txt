Forget the frantic race to the finish

of whether it ends smoothly or in a

the time spent playing was,
well, actually wasted. But it
wasn’t. The act of playing is a
perfectly valid form of artistic
expression whether you’re
shooting ink in Splatoon or
complementing froggits in
Undertale. This will be a con-
troversial opinion but I think
the ending of a videogame
is as meaningless as the end
G
aming isn’t
all fun and
games
perhaps
ironically.
In fact
gamers are often pressed
for time, having to juggle
life admin and professional
obligations on top of their
gaming habit. It’s fair to
say we rarely have the time
to complete many games,
and if we do, more often
than not we’re ‘rewarded’
with really polarising and
unsatisfying endings. Which
is why some games are
so notorious amongst the
uninitiated: because we can’t
stop bitching about that
unsatisfying ending.
Honestly, an ending
shouldn’t make or break
in real life, it’s the journey
that matters, not the desti-
nation. You’ve sat through
most of an engaging story,
you’ve immersed yourself in
the gameplay and you’ve
button-mashed your way to
victory in every boss fight.
And that was fun, that was
enjoyable. That was the real
gaming experience, not the
ending. Maybe Mass Effect
3 totally disregards all your
prior choices, but at least they
felt relevant when you made
them.
By extension, you shouldn’t
get so hung up on the games
you can’t finish. Real life
gets busy and can throw all
sorts of stuff your way. Some
games have ridiculously long
play times which may or may
not be worth the investment.
And besides, there’s so many
new titles coming out each
year. Some people, some-
how, are able to balance
everything (or maybe playing
games is all they do, who
knows). But it’s fine if you
personally can’t entirely com-
plete your ten-part adventure
series. There’s decades worth
of games that you can play
and enjoy. In the same vein,
I believe the only reason you
should try and unlock every
achievement is if you really,
really love a game and can’t
bring yourself to stop playing
it. Why bother slugging your
way to 100% completion
when you can enjoy so many
other titles?
Games are fundamentally
about having fun. The idea of
thinking of the ending as the
sole reward, something that’s
meant to compensate you
for the time spent playing,
seems to kind of imply that
score of a friendly game of
football. No one cares who
wins so long as everyone’s
had a good time.
Having said all that, I don’t
mean to detract from the
importance of a good story.
A powerful and engaging sto-
ryline in a videogame is what
makes the gaming experience
that much more unforgetta-
ble. Games employ a variety
of mechanisms to immerse
their audiences in their
artificial worlds. Some use
intricate detailed graphics,
others create beautiful sound-
scapes, but some games
are able to draw the player
in simply by the power of
narration. A good story can
create a tranquil oasis where
gamers can for a moment
become the leading charac-
ter, swept away in the artifical
drama. I’ve always felt this
way about video games
and I’m personally pleased
about the trend of games
becoming more story-driven
these days. Let’s look at a
favourite, Life is Strange for
example. *SPOILER ALERT*
While it nded with a binary
choice (only one of which was
actually good), the story and
adventure elements were
more than enough to make up
for the lacklustre finale.
No matter what kind of
The imperfect ending
your thing in which case, you
do you). Don’t let an abrupt
and messy ending ruin an
otherwise superb game for
you. Play what you can and
enjoy things at your own
pace. Whatever the ending
may hold, whether you even
reach it or not, just ride the
current and see where it takes
you. While a perfect ending is
great, a few terrible minutes
can’t and shoudn’t take away
from over 30 solid hours of
immersive fun.

Design an educational escape room!
Would you like to try your hand at designing an educational escape room?
We are excited to present and advertise an opportunity which Imperial
College Union have developed in collaboration with members of the Horizons
department. The experience is the first of its kind in that you as students will
work in teams to be in charge of designing an escape room puzzle.
We’re offering 25 students the opportunity to attend workshops at South
Kensington campus on 17th July and at the White City campus on 18th July
where you’ll visit the Advanced Hackspace and find out how you can use it to
build puzzles. For more information visit:

Attention Club Officers! So, you’ve successfully secured your place on a
committee, exams are coming to an end and Summer Ball is close (but yet so
far away). Now what…?
Enter the 2017 Officer Academy!
This year’s Officer Academy will provide you with the tools and knowledge to
run your Club, Society or Project well, while providing useful tips to help you
plan your year over the summer break. For more information visit:
imperialcollegeunion.org/OfficerAcademy2017
This summer Imperial College Union are teaming up with the Centre for
Academic English (CfAE) to support social events for their Pre-sessional
English learners. We are looking to recruit a team of enthusiastic English
speakers to help enhance the experience of those students taking the Pre-
sessional English course.
You will play a key role in engaging students in the programme’s social
activities throughout the summer, helping them to discover the local area,
adapt to British culture and feel part of the Imperial community. The most
important part of your role is to make students feel at ease and grow in
confidence when communicating in English. If you’d like to get involved visit:
