Imperial Fellwanderers Easter Tour
F
ollowing an early
flight at 7am from
Gatwick to Aber-
deen, we arrived
in the scenic vil-
lage Braemar in the
Cairngorms national park at
around 1pm. Kate, the provid-
er of Rucksacks accommoda-
tion, greeted us as we sleepily
got off the bus. Luckily Brae-
mar was the end of the line, as
otherwise we might’ve missed
it!
Checking the weather
forecast we were pleasantly
surprised. We seemed to be
incredibly fortunate to have
arrived in the Cairngorms
during one of its very few
sunny weeks of the year.
With the good news having
put a spring in our step, we
slowly climbed our first hill,
Morrone (859m). It was a
pleasant albeit sleepy hike
and we spotted the famous
black grouse as a bonus, so
hey. Returning to Rucksacks
we made some lovely tomato
and vegetable pasta for
dinner, perfect for another
day of fellwandering.
The next day we caught up
on some sleep, starting our
walk at 10am and headed
towards the Munro, Lochna-
gar (1155m). There was so
much sun we got sunburnt. In
Aberdeen. I know.
Now we had to decide
which route to take back to
Braemar. Awkwardly, the
river Dee does not have a
bridge in Braemar which
forced us to spend about an
hour walking on the road on
the way back. It wasn’t too
bad since the sun was still
shining and the view was still
quite picturesque.
Day three was even more
eventful to put it mildly.
The lack of a bridge in
Braemar proved to be quite
an issue. To get around it we
found a section of the river
which was shallow enough
for us to cross. We cautiously
walked across the fast-flowing
freezing water with our bare
feet on the slippery riverbed
stones, with the sun still
burning bright. Only three of
us made it across as Hardeep
wasn’t particularly keen on
walking in cold water. Hard-
eep insisted we go on without
him, and so we did (sorry).
We walked along quite
a long track with a steady
incline (not steep enough to
get left behind). The sun was
insane and the landscape was
full of dry red little bushes.
I couldn’t believe we were
in Scotland – it was like the
plane we took from Gatwick
went south instead of north.
With quite a strong pace it
wasn’t long until we summited
the south top (1177m). It’s
weird when the sun is shining
yet you find yourself treading
through snow.
On the way back we didn’t
manage to get to the river
crossing before dark because
we managed to miss the path.
This meant having to contour
around the steep slope with
those red bushes scraping our
legs. Arguably it wasn’t the
best terrain for walking and
we were all relieved when
we completed the descent
down to the river. Eventually
we were faced with a dreary
8km walk on a desolate
road in the dark, with only
one torch between us. Our
spirits were low as it was late
(9pm) and we had run out of
food. We tried running but it
didn’t last long. Luckily a car
approached and we were
delighted when we found out
that it was two Irish mountain
rescue chaps! They drove us
all the way back to the Co-op
in Braemar which we made
it to just before closing time
to pick up ready meals and
pizza. We were not up for
cooking after that 42km walk!
The fourth day was a rest
day as after a quite some
eventful days the group
decided to take it a little
easier. I began the day with a
traditional Scottish break-
fast including lorne square
sausage and black pudding.
The others weren’t interested
in such delicacies. Obviously
only the enlightened amongst
us shovel grease down their
throat for enjoyment.
The others decided to
stretch their legs and so

climbed the local hill Creag
Choinnich (538m). The route
was part of a permanent
orientating course though we
were too tired from previous
days to complete it. A quick
ascent to the top gave us a
fine view of Braemar and the
surrounding hills. Martin was
also interested in the differ-
ence between Caledonian
and alp pine trees, the former
looking far more impressive,
though other group members
didn’t see the nuance. We
then went back for Lunch.
Before sunset, Martin ran
up Morrone(859m) while
Hardeep hid in the bushes,
capturing some amazing
shots of a herd of red deer!
Hardeep also returned
from another village called
Ballater, “knocked off the
bucket list” and we ate a tasty
vegetable curry dinner. In
the evening, we completed a
500 piece puzzle of Europe
(on the eve of the article 50
trigger), though the map was
many years out of date…
The next day Hardeep left
to continue exciting travels
across much of Scotland.
Martin and Ollie were given
a lift to the Lin of the Dee by
Kate to continue exploring,
They took the long way to the
entrance of the Lairig Ghru
and Corrour bothy. They
climbed up to the Devil’s Point
(completely cloudy/misty at
last) and then tried to get to
Cairn Toul but retreated at
Stob Coire an t-Saighdeir due
to the icy conditions resulting
from a total white-out in some
areas. On the way back, a
negotiation concluded with
one Oreo every 2km on
the road to keep spirits up.
We had dinner (cheese and
tomato sauce pasta) and
slept. On the final day we
flew from Aberdeen to Luton.
Fellwanderers out.
