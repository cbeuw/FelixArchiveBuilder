Who are
the DUP?
Ratan Gor tries to clear up some post-
election head-scratching
L
ast week’s general
election marked a
momentous occasion.
The youth, generally
considered docile
and apathetic when it
comes to politics and voting,
went out in their droves to
flex their muscle. The main
battleground for the election
was social media. The
weapons of choice: memes
and parody videos ranging
from the naughty corn-field
memes of Theresa May –
which gained a Harambe-
like following – to Jeremy
Corbyn’s face superimposed
onto Stormzy’s Shut-up video.
The events of the day played
out in dramatic fashion.
The Conservatives, despite
ending up with the highest
comparative number of seats,
failed to secure a majority like
the one they had before the
election. Labour on the other
hand managed to claw back
30 seats – meteorically better
than what was projected to be
a colossal collapse. Perhaps
just as significant as the
number of seats won were the

the ‘King Makers’ of the
election as the Tories have
tried to cut a deal with them in
order to form a government.
However, just who are they,
what do they stand for, and
why are they suddenly so
important?
First let's note that a majority
government helps legislation to
be passed through Parliament,
as MPs of the governing party
can account for more than
half the votes. A minority
government, on the other
hand, has to sway members
of other parties in order to get
enough votes to pass a bill.
Coalitions and deal-making
with other parties can help
create a majority government
and are the options Theresa
May’s Conservatives are
currently considering. This is
where the DUP come in.
Why the DUP and no one
else you may ask? Basically,
because no one else would
dare cut a deal with the Tories
at this moment in time for fear
of alienating their voters and
committing political suicide.
As a result, the DUP now have
leverage over the Tories as
they know that Labour will be
only too willing to propose
their own government with the
backing of any of the other
parties, with whom they see
eye-to-eye with on a number
of key issues.
The DUP is a right-wing,
unionist, political party that
is currently lead by Arlene
Foster. Their position on key
issues has been a cause for
concern for many over the
past few days.
Their position on LGBTQ+
rights, freedoms and liberties
especially concerning since
The Donald’s messy pull out
from the Paris Agreement.
We can’t afford any more
governments even considering
neglecting this critical issue if
our planet is to have a future.
Should a deal therefore be
agreed between the Tories
and the DUP, the latter will
have the ear of a government
which they would use to try
and sway decisions made on
such matters to bring them
in-line with their archaic
worldview.
Ex-Tory PM, Sir John Major,
has stated that cutting a deal
with the DUP would also go
against the Good Friday
Agreement which states that
the UK government should
remain impartial when it
comes to dealing with political
parties of Northern Ireland. So
maybe we are in for another
handbrake turn. If the last few
weeks have taught us anything
in fact, it is that Ms May is
indeed the ‘U-turn Queen’.
She called this election looking
to secure her coronation with
an overwhelming majority.
I'm sure this precarious
government wasn’t quite what
she had in mind.
The Tories were ripped apart
like a fox on a hound hunt on
June 8th
– poetic justice. They
are now in intensive care and
are seeking radical surgery to
help stitch them back up. All
other parties have refused to
operate stating that the risks
are too high. And while the
DUP seem to be more than
keen to lend a helping hand,
the question is: at what price?
We will have to wait and see.

margins by which they were
won. MPs on both sides of the
aisle saw themselves elected
with wafer-thin margins as
historical majorities melted like
ice-cream in the sun. UKIP was
expunged from parliament
failing to capture a single seat.
The SNP lost more than a third
of theirs. Despite gaining
four more seats, the Lib Dems
suffered the loss of their
steward, Nick Clegg, who was
rejected by Sheffield Hallam,
a seat which was thought to
be solid. Perhaps the most
significant result came on the
other side of the Irish Sea as
the Democratic Unionist Party
(DUP) of Northern Ireland,
won ten seats. They have

They oppose gay marriage
so much so that they blocked
it passing into law despite its
winning approval in Northern
Ireland's parliament in 2015.
They also vehemently
oppose abortion. In Northern
Ireland, the criteria for having
an abortion are exceptionally
strict. This leads many to
travel to England to have the
procedure done privately.
Such a policy has even lead
some women to illegally buy
medication online if they are
unable to afford the trip.
The DUP is riddled with
climate change sceptics,
with their ex environmental
minister having outright called
global warming a con. This is

heresa May went
for a power grab.
She wanted to wipe
out Labour while her
party was polling
with almost 20
points ahead of them. With
a fragmented opposition
and Corbyn’s poor approval
ratings, everyone assumed it
was going to be a landslide
election. So how did this all
backfire and end up in a hung
parliament?

Conservatives were unable to
keep their majority.
A Failure of Leadership
When a Prime Minister calls
a snap election to “bring
stability to the country,”
you would expect them to
put forward the case for
their party’s leadership. Yet
complacency and disregard
for the electorate was shown
throughout the campaign.
Rejecting calls for a debate
with Corbyn, including from
the man himself, was not
a power move – it looked
weak. It was an opportunity
to hit hard about why the
Tories were preferable for the
economy, security, and Brexit
negotiations. Yet May failed
to appear in any debates and
stooped as low as to send
Amber Rudd in her place, less
than 48 hours after Rudd’s
father’s death.
The manifesto didn’t help
either. It looked half-arsed
and not like something you’d
expect from the only party
who knew there was going
to be an election. Unlike
Labour’s, it wasn’t even costed.
There are many challenges
our society is facing (and lack
of government control over the
Internet is not one of them).
With weak suggestions such
as bringing back fox hunting
and introducing a dementia
tax, the public understandably
became dissatisfied with these
ideas.
A Failure of Messaging
An over-reliance on
traditional media and tabloids
also contributed to May’s
loss of seats. The influence
of these sources is waning,
particularly in an era where a
Google search can reveal the
truth about a misrepresented
opposition policy. On top
of that, all the ‘Corbyn is
a terrorist sympathiser!’
smearing failed to stick. The
tabloids went over the top,
and it is likely that at least part
of their readership rejected
their incredulous claims.
him a ‘weak pacifist’ and a
‘terrorist sympathiser’ for
daring to suggest that perhaps
Britain shouldn’t be so keen on
military intervention abroad.
A Failure of Judgment
The Conservatives failed to
assess the situation properly,
and they did not expect the
Labour manifesto to land so
well. It was well written, fully
costed and comprehensive.
The Labour campaign
successfully showed that this
isn’t #EURef2, but a general
election that is about many
more issues than just Brexit.
It had a central theme: hope.
‘Look at what our country
could become!’ is definitively
more powerful than fear-
mongering and complaining
about the other side –
something that plagued not
only May’s campaign, but
also Ed Miliband in 2015.
This positive campaigning
resonated with the electorate
and is reflected in the gains
that Labour made.
With digital media, Corbyn’s
message found its way
through to the young voters,
who turned out in droves
and helped swing seats. He
was not a typical politician,
artificial and polished like his
Conservative counterpart,
and this helped in an era
where people are becoming
increasingly disillusioned with
polished politics. This led to
the massive audiences we
saw at Corbyn’s rallies, and
the feeling that he had won
the hearts of a significant
portion of the electorate, to
the surprise of the Tories.
Friday came, Corbyn
outperformed everyone’s
expectations, and he may
well have done better had
his MPs backed him from the
beginning. On the other hand,
May’s hideous campaign
which blatantly disregarded
the electorate did not win over
the country. The public reacted
predictably, depriving the
\\ It should have

After a massive U-turn on not
holding a snap election, May
set out to make it all about a
single issue: Brexit. “The other
parties hinder the process,”
she said. “We must elect a
strong and stable government
with a mandate to pursue a
hard Brexit.”
It was simple. This wasn’t
about the country, or stability
for Brexit negotiations. This
was a selfish decision made to
benefitherpartyandobliterate
the voices of the opposition. It
should have been a slam dunk.
Corbyn had never been more
unpopular, even with some
of his most vocal supporters
feeling unsure about him.
The situation was bleak for
Labour, and for the left wing
in this country. Nonetheless,
May failed so severely that the

appearances, May was held

Audience members would grill
her about the cuts made to the
police, to schools, to disability
allowances – all difficult
to defend – while Corbyn
unashamedly stood up for the
Labour manifesto and did not
apologise for his beliefs.
She tried to look tough on
terror by saying she would
curtail Internet freedom and
scrap human rights laws while
presiding over police cuts
and arms deals with Saudi
Arabia – a country that funds
mosques in the UK that preach
the Wahhabist interpretation
of Islam which inspired ISIS.
Still the tabloids went after
Corbyn, simultaneously calling
Conservatives of a majority
and forcing them to make a

Force. Wait, wasn't Jezza
