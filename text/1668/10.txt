A
natomy of
a Suicide
follows the
stories of three
generations
of women
of the same family, linked
together not only by their
genetic heritage, but also
by the same emotions and
struggles as they battle with
mental illness. Carol is a
1970s housewife, struggling
to find reasons to stay in the
world. Almost 30 years later,
in the late 90s, Anna, her
daughter, is struggling with
a drug addiction, triggered
by the loss of her mother.
30 years later still, we meet
Bonnie, a busy doctor in
an A&E department, who
is coping admirably with
the stress of her work, but is
closed off and distant, famous
for not interacting with her
colleagues outside work.
The three stories unfold
simultaneously in front us,
the dialogue spilling over
between the three scenes.
It should be confusing,
especially given the small
stage of the Royal Court, but
the staging is such that each
story is clear in its own right
and carries its own weight.
The staging is hauntingly
beautiful and one of the
best features of the play.
The stage is a sparse grey,
split in thirds, one for each
protagonist. The supporting
cast revolve around the three
women, sometimes playing
different roles and other
times, older versions of the
same characters. This gives a
beautiful sense of continuity;
there is a strong sense that
we are watching the same
story unfurl whilst affixed to
three different axes. Between
scenes, each of the central
characters is repositioned
by the people around them.
Stripped and redressed by
the supporting cast; they are
moved like dolls in their own
stories. By so viscerally taking
agency from the characters
we experience the sense of
helplessness and inevitability
that reverberates throughout
each story.
Alice Birch’s writing is
achingly beautiful – each
character’s story stands
apart, but the dialogue inter-
sects between them, reused
and echoed, seamlessly
weaving them together. “Are
you happy?” is a recurring
refrain, spoken to each of
the characters at one point
or another, but is never as
straightforward a question as
it seems. Director Katie Mitch-
ell’s work complements Birch’s
writing perfectly as the stories
come together visually in a
way that reflects the writing.
Each story fills its own space,
merging with its neighbour,
but never completely invad-
ing it.

brilliant. Hattie Morahan as
Carol conveys a silent, but
poetic resignation. Katie
O’Flynn brings a real raw
emotion to Anna in her
desperate monologues and
the physicality of her acting.
Adelle Leonce’s Bonnie is
restrained and calm, her
subtle performance perfectly
capturing the character’s
suppressed anguish.
The story isn’t without
flaws – the focus on suicide,
whilst true to the name of the
play, doesn’t do justice to the
complexity of mental illness
faced by each of the three
women and, on occasion, the
recurring themes and pieces
of dialogue feel repetitive.
But these are minute flaws
in what is otherwise an
overwhelmingly moving piece
of work. The intensity of Anat-
omy of a Suicide is something
few plays manage to
capture; it is an
experience in
itself.
