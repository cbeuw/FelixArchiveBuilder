I
t’s the final issue. I’ve ranted for some 28 editions
now and you guys have taken it like champs. In
my last editorial I’d like to say one final thing
before I fade into irrelevance. I want to talk about
complaining.
I’m a great complainer. I bitch and moan about
everything. I quit an online publication I used to do
some work for after they asked me to be more positive
in my online presence (they literally wrote up a whole
new social media policy because of me and asked
everyone to sign it). I told them to shove their positivity
where the sun don’t shine.
So yes, I complain. That’s not to say I’m a negative
person but I’m certainly no bucket of sunshine. I like to
pick things apart, I enjoy raining on people’s parades,
and I love ruining moments. You could be telling me
about how you’re going to Nepal to build schools and
I’d say what they really need is roads. I could be sat on
a beach with someone I love telling me this is the best
day of their life and I’d probably say “it’s somewhere
in my top 50” back. I could be serenaded by Frank
Ocean and comment on how his shoes don’t match
his belt.
I bitch and moan unapologetically, especially about
Imperial (but like who doesn’t). And as a consequence
some people might think I hate it here (which is as true
as it is about any semi-permanent fixture in my life).
The truth though is I really don’t. I might not love it
like a fruit that plopped out of my loins (this mental
picture is really my final gift to you) but I do believe
it’s a great place. Sure it’s also a terrible place, but
mostly it’s great. The people here might be a bunch
of problematic weirdos (just think about the phrase
“they’re a bit Imperial”) but they’re also stupidly
intelligent, hyper-passionate about what they do, and
remarkable in more ways than my editorial can afford
to expand on. The institution itself, despite some dark
facets of its culture, is cutting-edge and brilliant in
many ways.
I owe a lot of who I am today to my six year love-hate
relationship with College. Some of my closest friends
have passed through these lecture halls while some of
the people I admire most have taught in them. And of
course some of my most memorable boning locations
are in and around the South Ken campus (including
where you are sitting right now).
Back to the value of complaining though, perhaps
the reason why Imperial is so great is that so many
of you also can’t stop complaining. Whether it’s the
reps asking for Panopto, Divest Imperial pushing for
a greener university, Physics tanking their NSS scores
in protest of a teaching quality they deem sub-par, or
Council often nitpicking the dumbest of things.
Complaining is the fundamental force propelling
change. We’re getting consent training next year,
humane library temperatures, and an unstable
government in the process of exiting the EU because
someone somewhere complained.
And this is what we here at felix do. A lot. The Union,
College, students even will ask us why we don’t report
on all the amazing things happening at Imperial. And
my answer is that actually we do, but really that’s not
our job. We’re not a PR leaflet, we’re not the Reporter,
and we’re not the Union’s marketing team. What we’re
here for is to complain, use our platform to give you
guys a voice and highlight issues we think are important
to you. We seldom turn down pieces regardless of
their politics (apart from hate speech obviously) and in
fact we often try to commission pieces that go against
everything we believe in.
My job is to complain and encourage other people
to follow suit. It doesn’t matter if it’s about the Oil and
Gas Industry, curly fries, Theresa May or the library
air con. Complain, repeatedly and incessantly, and
you will be heard.
So that’s me this year. Hope we complained enough
to have given you some permanent eye-damage from
all the eye-rolling you were probably doing.
Thanks to the amazing editorial team that often
carried me. This is all because of you. Many thanks
to Luke Granger-Brown for being a god amongst
mortals, to Tessa Davey for adding hours of work to
my schedule, to Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi for holding
the copy-fort, and Hamish Beck who singlehandedly
carried the puzzles section. And thanks to everyone
(and there were more of you than I expected) who
threatened to sue me this year too. I think of you when
I masturbate.
