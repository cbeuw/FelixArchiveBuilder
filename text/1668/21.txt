This week you are
felix’s team of crack
lawyers. Unfortunately
you are all patent
lawyers. Bloody
scientists

This week you are
in a park when a ball
from a nearby football
game rolls over. For
a moment you forget
you’re a nerd and
attempt to kick it back.
You seize up mid-kick.
Again.
This week you are a
graduating member of
the Beit Cartel. You got
a 2:2. Was the petty
infighting really worth
it?
This week you
threaten to sue felix.
Please take a number.
This week you are
obsessed by Unwound
– Lady Elect. The
melancholy of the
lyrics accompanied by
the swell in the song
intertwines with the-
What the fuck? These
are horoscopes. Go
away Rob.
This week you
are Lef. People will
only remember
you for your nearly
controversial
centrefolds, your
desire to get naked
and your poor grasp
of spelling.
This week you finally
finish your degree after
four long years of jumping
through hoops and all-
nighters. Vongratulations
you’re a German circus
master.
This week you
threaten to remove
breakfasts from the
SCR. College is not
ready for the fury they
unleash.
This week you do not
return a textbook your
friend got out of the
library for you. Your
friend cannot graduate
as a result and dies
in poverty. You feel
nothing.
This week you are
DramSoc the union’s
best society. Best
cleaning society that
is. #Fashion
This week you hear the
stage in the great hall at
the summer ball will have
confetti cannons as well
as CO2 cannons. You are
instantly excited. GIVE
THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY
WANT PETE.
This week you try
beef jerky for the first
time. You think it tastes
like burnt pepperoni
peeled off a week old
pizza. Your esteem of
anglo culture is at an
all time low.

Dear Chris
Summer’s coming and everyone’s going on holiday. I enjoy
a good trip with the lads like any good lad but because I took
a year out in the middle of my degree to find myself (I only
found myself surrounded by enemies) and all my uni friends
already have jobs and don’t want to come on holiday with
me, I find myself alone this year.
I could go on my own or ask my lab-mates to go on a trip.
I’m unsure whether we are ready to take the scary step from
acquaintances to ‘holiday friends’ but going on holiday alone
is a bit grim.
Please Chris you have to help me you’re my only hope.
Cheers,
Matt Mills
Honey,
What I would suggest you do is look at some
educational material.
Let’s start with Eurotrip. My memory of this
film is pretty fuzzy but from its Wikipedia
entry Eurotrip looks like a great place to start.
This film taught me that while Eastern Europe
looks ugly it will also provide you with copious
amounts of absinthe while getting you laid.
Now this film falls strongly on the side of go go
go but don’t go alone because whilst you don’t
know this lab partner you’re going to need
a bro to spot you when you black out. Also if
you drink lots of absinthe there is no way you’ll
remember any awkward conversations you
may have had.
Second source of inspiration, The Holiday.
Again haven’t watched it but apparently
people sort of wife-swap so that they can get
laid and they go to locations in totally differ-
ent continents to follow through. If Jude Law
HOROSCOPES
can travel to America for a bullshit reason so
he can pork Cameron Diaz then what is your
excuse!
Finally, Taken and Taken 2 if you have the
stomach for it. A double bill of educational
material here. This taught me two rules 1)
never ever leave your house unless you know
Liam Neeson (but like actually know, not my
girlfriend’s cousin had coffee with him once,
but I talk to him when I feel sad on the phone
and he comforts me know him) and 2) these
films really put the human trafficking business
in a really bad light.
Right if you can’t piece together some advice
from those three pieces of required audio
visual entertainment then you don’t deserve a
holiday.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
