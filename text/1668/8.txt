It doesn't matter
if you're queer or
not, you need to
support Gay Pride
Lef Apostolakis is fed up of faux
acceptance
I
t doesn’t matter if you’re
queer or not. You need to
support Gay Pride.
It’s that rainbow month
of the year again, when
queersallaroundtheworld
take to the streets to celebrate
being alive and every bigoted
dickhead gets the opportunity
to rant about how they “don’t
mind The Gays but do they
really have to strap a dildo on
their heads and strut around
in public”. Though such
questions tend to produce a
small pulsating vein on my
forehead, I’ve come to realise
they do raise legitimate points.
Because how can people
who are uncomfortable with
the LGBTQ+ community be
expected to celebrate it when
all they’ve ever been asked to
do is to tolerate it?
Fuck tolerance.
Controversial, I know. For
a long time I really thought
tolerance was the Holy Grail,
because tolerance meant
being allowed to exist. This
tolerance came at the price of
not drawing attention to your
irregularity, not provoking,
being invisible and most
importantly being grateful for
it. Today I want more.
Before coming out to my
parents, I thought I’d be happy
with not being disowned and
although they accept and love
me still, to say that I’m happy
with the resolution of my big
coming out would be a lie.
Our relationship has changed
and although it’s slowly being
mended it will take years
before they’re comfortable
with who I am.
This spring my mother came
to visit. We drank and talked
and cried and got closer than
I think we’ve ever been. Still,
when I joked about taking her
to Pride with me she made it
clear it would take a while
before we got anywhere near
that stage.
It’s understandable. She’s of
a different generation. All I
can do is love her with all my
heart and be there when she is
ready to join me. Some of my
best friends have repeatedly
told me I should be grateful
for the love and acceptance
I’ve received, and I really am.
But I’m also asking for more,
not from my parents really but
from society. I’m done being
tolerated, feeling appreciated
despite being gay.
Tolerance is great and all
when we’re talking about
religion, heatwaves, or
London’s crack fox population.
But really if you think about it,
tolerance should not be used
to describe groups of people.
We shouldn’t tolerate
the Gays, the Muslims, the
Blacks, the ‘insert minority
group's name here’. They’re
not ideologies, they’re not
adverse weather conditions,
and they’re not pests. They’re
people.
People are meant to be
loved and celebrated. It
doesn’t matter what you are.
I don’t care about the colour
of your skin, your genitals,
your gender or lack thereof.
I couldn’t give a fuck about
your religion. I care about
who you are. I care about
how you treat me and others.
By offering tolerance to
me you’re disrespecting me
by acknowledging your
superiority and power over
me. To ask for tolerance is
even worse. It’s an act of
desperation, an admittance of
defeat. Sure there are places
in the world where members
of the queer community have
to literally plead for their lives,
but thankfully this is no longer
one of them. So I’m done
pleading. I’m ready to claim
the respect I deserve.
It’s not an easy conclusion
to arrive to. I myself didn’t
get it until I went to my first
Gay Pride last year. I had
just completed a final round
of very public coming outs
(may it be the last one) to my
extended family, and pretty
much anyone who still kept
when they almost indifferently
said they would.
I remember wandering
through London and seeing
people being themselves,
happy, unafraid.
I remember the speeches
and the concerts and being
able to share that moment with
people that I loved and who
loved me back. That feeling of
belonging, acceptance, blind
love, community; that was
the closest I’ve ever come to
experiencing God.
I remember all the people
marching, some sporting
feathered buttplugs and
leather chokers, others metre-
high wigs and towering heels.
People with hairy pits, legs,
and crotches, people with
unicorn makeup, flannel shirts,
septum piercings, shaved
heads, tracksuits, gimpsuits,
and suits made of latex. But
most vividly I remember the
‘normies’, the straight allies,
the ones who didn’t care
about who anyone was, the
ones who’d come to show their
love.
Because that’s what Pride is
really about. It’s transcended
from a celebration of
queerness to a celebration
of love. Love that crosses
borders, disregards social
norms, colour blind love, tone-
deaf love, gender-bending,
cross-dressing, unboxable
love.
And that’s why you need to
celebrate Pride. Sure some
of the events face inclusivity
issues, or have complacently
fallen victims to consumerism
but Pride remains one of the
most beautiful celebrations
established by our civilization.
If you believe in a world
united, a world that trumps
hate, where people can
just unapologetically be
themselves, free, beautiful,
and powerful, you simply
have to participate. It doesn’t
matter what you are.
Just love me and I will love
you back.
No that’s not right.
You don’t have to love me,
just let me love you.
in touch with me through
social media, and I was free
to publicly participate in
one of the world’s largest
celebrations of queerness.
I remember shyly almost
asking some close friends
whether they’d like to go to
London Pride with me and the
excitement that engulfed me

Writing mental
illness off as a
personality quirk
is dangerous
Vivien Hadlow thinks that warning
people against categorising personality
traits as mental illnesses can be
counterproductive
T
wo weeks ago, I
read an article in
felix posing the
question: “Are
we medicalising
p e r s o n a l i t y ? ”
The author argues that self-
diagnosis of a mental health
problem can be risky. I agree.
They argue that convincing
yourself you have a mental
illness when you don’t,
can make you miserable. I
agree. Something far more
dangerous, however, is to
convince yourself you don’t
have a mental health problem
when you do.
If I had read this article in my
first, or maybe even early on in
my second, year of university,
it would have confirmed my
worst fear: maybe I’m just
like this. Maybe I’m just a
bit pathetic, and that’s why
I get stressed so easily and
spend hours hyperventilating
and crying for no apparent
reason. And anyway, if I didn’t
want to be stressed I should
have just gone to lectures and
done my work – it’s my own
fault for being so lazy and
staying in my room all day.
My life is fine, and thinking
that everything would be
better if I didn’t exist, is just
melodramatic self-indulgence.
Why on earth would I ask for
help when all my problems
are my fault? I’m just like this.
This is the mentality that
stopped me from seeking
help until my second year of
university, and while I can’t
know for sure how much
earlier intervention would
have helped, I have no doubt
that it is this mentality that has
largely ruined my university
experience. And I am sure
that I am not alone in this.
It is extremely common for
those suffering from mental
illness to have thoughts like
this, and blame themselves
for problems arising from
their condition. I have always
been quite lazy, and not
particularly sociable. These
are personality traits of mine
which have always meant
I have to put in more effort
than many other people into
dragging myself out of bed
or doing my homework, and
makemyselfgooutwithfriends
instead of staying in my room.
But that was all it was – just a
little bit more effort. It is worlds
away from the days when I
cannot even bring myself to
get out of bed to brush my
teeth. I can recognise this now,
but since my mental health
deteriorated gradually rather
than suddenly taking a turn for
the worse, it was very easy for
me to confuse my depression
with my laziness, and my
anxiety with self-induced
stress. Even when I started to
suspect differently and look
up information online about
depression, I felt an enormous
sense of guilt and couldn’t rid
myself of the feeling that I was
just, as the author suggests,
looking for an excuse to hide
behind. Terrified of other
people forming the same
opinion, I did my best to hide it
from almost everyone – even
my first therapist, to whom I
downplayed the impact it was
having on my life for fear that
she, too, would think it was
my own fault. Again, this is
not uncommon, but something
that many people who have
some form of mental health
better to reach out to friends
or people they trust to talk
about it rather than “just
calling themselves a bit shy”.
The troubling implication of
this suggestion is that unless
you have what the author
refers to as a “medically
diagnosable mental health
problem”, you should just get
over it and accept that it’s part
of who you are. Reading it
now, having been receiving
treatment for over a year and
spoken to numerous medical
professionals, still made me
panic about whether or not I
really had just been making
up elaborate lies to myself
and others to cover up the
fact that I am lacking as a
person. To someone who has
not yet sought help, or is not
surrounded by the incredibly
supportive network of friends
and family that I am lucky
enough to have, it could be
actively harmful.
I am not disputing that the
article raises a valid point –
there is a valuable discussion
to be had about the risks of
self-diagnosis and confusion
between personality traits
and mental illnesses. There is
a huge amount of information
online, much of it not written
by health professionals, about
many different types of mental
illness, and it is definitely
necessary to exercise caution
when identifying with the
symptoms listed. Feeling
lethargic and being reclusive
don’t necessarily mean you
are depressed, and feeling
nervous about a social
situation doesn’t necessarily
mean you have social
anxiety. Convincing yourself
that it does, which is very
possible (everyone’s made the
mistake of turning to WebMD
for advice on a physical
ailment and decided they’re
dying), will be detrimental
to your wellbeing. But the
article’s focus on warning
people against mistaking a
personality trait as a mental
illness serves to dissuade them
from seeking help. There are
already enough obstacles to
people seeking help without
actively feeding the paranoia
that they are being irrational
and looking to shift the blame
for personal failings.
problem experience.
Perhaps I am being naive,
but if someone has reason
to believe they have social
anxiety, maybe it would be
