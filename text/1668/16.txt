Qasim Mahmood goes
over all the key reveals
and developments to
come out of E3 last week
7, which showed off the
impressive graphic feats of
their new machine running at
4K and 60fps, and they also
revealed a brand-new car at
the event; the 2018 Porsche
9-11 GT2 RS. Next up was
Metro Exodus, in which the
post-apocalyptic wasteland
seems to be even better than
in previous titles; the preview
followed and its cargo is
stolen; the cargo turning out
to be another supercar. It
seems fun and over-the-top,
and will be released on the
10th
November.
By far the highlight of their
press conference however,
was A Way Out, a game
from the developers behind
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.
It is an exclusively co-op
game, to be enjoyed either
on the couch or online,
where two players must work
together to escape a prison.
The two players’ actions are
independent of each other
and both need to heavily
cooperate in order to make
it to safety. Overall this one
seems particularly exciting,
and is definitely one to watch
out for as it releases in 2018.
Finally, EA ended with
the smallest of teases for
Bioware’s new IP, Anthem,
which received a much more
substantial reveal the follow-
ing day at Microsoft’s press
conference.
The press conference was
great and opened with, as
expected, a large focus on
Microsoft’s new console, offi-
cially named the Xbox One
X. The console is advertised
as the most powerful console
ever created, and will be
released in early November
for £450.
They then focused on
software, showing off 42
games. First up was Forza
showed footage of the player
hunting down mutated beasts,
before finally jumping on a
steam locomotive to safety.
Everyone was then treated
to the worldwide première of
Assassin’s Creed Origins. The
latest game in the series is set
in ancient Egypt, which looks
phenomenal by the way, and
the hero Bayek was shown
riding through his hometown
and assassinating one of his
targets. The preview revealed
new light RPG elements
where Bayek levels up and
gains ability points, as well
as sporting an eagle which
helps him scout out enemy
encampments.
Microsoft had a few more
reveals, including PlayerUn-
known’s Battlegrounds, State
of Decay 2, Minecraft in 4K
and DragonBall FighterZ.
They then proceeded to an
extended look at Sea of
Thieves, Rare’s open-world
pirate game, which featured
treasure hunting, riddle
solving and a large-scale
naval battle in the middle of a
massive storm. It was argua-
bly the highlight of the show;
the colour scheme is bright
and vibrant and the game-
play looks incredibly fun.

T
his past week E3
was in full swing,
with all the largest
game companies
holding press
conferences to
showcase their newest games
and consoles. While this
year was more subdued than
previous years, especially
compared to the phenomenal
expos of 2015 and 2016, it
was still a very fun event and
had a few welcome surprises.
First up was EA, who didn’t
quite start E3 off with the
bang we all hoped for. They
first focused on their sports
games; NBA Live 18, Madden
18 and Fifa 18, with the latter
monopolising our interest as
it’s set to get an official Switch
release. EA also showed a

of September and Novem-
ber respectively, and were
followed by a length demo of
Middle-earth: Shadow of War
and the reveal of Ori and the
Will of the Wisps. They then
announced that original Xbox
games are being added to
backwards compatibility, and
then closed their show with
the big reveal of Bioware’s
new IP, Anthem. It is a game
featuring high-tech exosuits
known as Javelins, with
which players can brave the

demo for Need for Speed
Payback. In it we witnessed
a heist in which a truck is
wilderness, exploring and
killing the enemies they came
across. It looks like a great
mix between a shooter and
open-world exploration, sim-
ilar to Destiny, and is slated
for 2018.
Next up was Bethesda
who frankly had the least
interesting showing this year.
The only new reveals were
Skyrim and Fallout 4 in VR,
followed by The Evil Within 2
and Wolfenstein II, with the
latter two games revealing
some great trailers.
Ubisoft was next,
surprisingly having a phe-
nomenal press conference.
They started with the reveal
of Mario + Rabbids: King-
dom Battle, which is a very
interesting SRPG exclusive
to the Switch. It features
turn-based strategy combat
as well as simple open-world
exploration, and releases on
29th
August. It also allowed
Miyamoto to make one of
his trademark entrances,
which was incredibly fun. The
director of the game was also
visibly emotional, which made
the presentation that much
more heartfelt.
The Crew 2 was showcased
next which showed off several
different vehicles to race in,
and Skull and Bones, a game
based exclusively around
3v3 pirate naval battles.
They also had an extended
demo of Far Cry 5 where they
revealed Boomer, your dog
companion.
Finally came their big
announcement: Beyond Good
and Evil 2, 15 years after the
original game was released.
It acts as a prequel and the
trailer was phenomenal.
It depicted the setting and
characters incredibly well,
and hinted at some game-
play mechanics. Very little
is known about it as of yet,
more promising this time.
The gameplay seemed fun
and the number of zombies
on-screen was impressive,
but the zombie animals,
such as the zombie bear that
ended the demo, gave it an
extra dimension. Monster
Hunter World was the next
announcement placing the
massive series back on a
Sony home console. With
impressive graphics and new
features such as camouflage
and taking cover, it seems like
it’s the natural evolution of the
franchise.
A big surprise announce-
ment came in the form of
Shadow of the Colossus, a
remake of the beloved PS2
classic which is lauded as
one of the greatest games
ever made. Then a few PSVR
games were shown off,
before moving onto God of
War, where an extended
trailer showed off the bond
between Kratos and his son
Artreus, as well as the new
over-the-shoulder action
gameplay.
After that was time to tease
David Cage’s new game
Detroit: Become Human, with
a pair of androids attempt-
ing to ‘awaken’ their fellow
androids and rebel against
their human masters. As with
the first trailer, there seem to
be multiple different outcomes
depending on the options
chosen.
Finally, to close off their
show, Sony showed off
Insomniac’s Spider-Man,
which received an extended
gameplay demo. The game’s
taken many cues from Rock-
steady’s phenomenal Batman
Arkham series. The stealth
and combat were incredibly
similar, though it has action
set pieces with QTEs and
quips galore, like Uncharted.
The exploration and game-
play seem great, and it is set
for a 2018 release.
Finally, we were treated
to the Nintendo Spotlight,
a short 30 minute video
which showcased many new
upcoming Switch games.
First, Rocket League was
confirmed to be coming to the
Switch with exclusive items
and cross-platform play, in
2017. Xenoblade Chronicles 2
then revealed a trailer which
shared story details and basic
though the internet is buzzing
with speculation.
Sony’s press conference
this year unfortunately, didn’t
meet the high expectations of
their previous two years, but it
was still a good showing over-
all. They lead with Uncharted:
The Lost Legacy, which seems
very similar to previous
games in the franchise. The
witty banter and over-the-
top action set pieces are still
here, only this time with Chloe
and Nadine heading the
adventure.
Next up was a demo of
Days Gone, which seemed
\\ The two biggest

gameplay, though it should
be said that the English voice
acting so far seems abysmal.
Hopefully this will be rectified
before its release.
New unnamed Kirby and
Yoshi Switch games were also
teased, with simple trailers
that demonstrated the 2.5D
platforming and co-op func-
tionality; both are coming out
in 2018.
The two biggest Nintendo
reveals were Metroid Prime
4 and a new “core Pokémon
game” for the Switch, which
fans have been clamour-
ing since the Switch was
announced, though nothing
more was said. The Zelda
DLCs received some more
information, with the second
DLC pack focusing on the four
Champions and Zelda. And
finally, Super Mario Odyssey
ended the Spotlight with a
phenomenal showing. New
hat powers will allow Mario
to possess enemies, NPCs and
inanimate objects and control
them for an amount of time. A
few new worlds were shown
as well as some sections fea-
turing old-school 2D Mario
sections, akin to Zelda: A Link
Between Worlds’ painting
mechanics. Odyssey releases
in October 2017.
All in all, though not the
best we’ve seen, this E3 didn’t
disappoint. There were many
surprise announcements
though some were noticeably
missing, such info on The Last
of Us Part II and on Ninten-
do’s online service. Still what
we got was good, and many
of the announced games look
very promising indeed.
