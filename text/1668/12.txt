The Summer
Exhibition
at the Royal
Academy
T
here aren’t many
galleries in which
you might expect to
see a multimillion
pound creation
by a Turner prize
winning artist exhibited on
equal footing with an oil
by Joe Bloggs from Surrey,
but that is exactly what the
Royal Academy’s Summer
Exhibition offers. Each year,
tens of thousands of works
are submitted to the Summer
Exhibition, not only from
established artists but also
from amateurs and students.
These are then whittled down
to the 1100 works ultimately
displayed on the walls of
the Royal Academy by the
Hanging Committee, this year
headed by Eileen Cooper.
Cooper has made it her
mission to widen the scope of
the Exhibition by making an
effort to showcase the work
of artists from a diverse range
of backgrounds in education,
race and nationality. This is
a necessary and admirable
goal, but her ideals were a
little undermined by her tour
of the works to the press. She
moved from one piece to the
next, detailing her connection
to the respective artists; one,
we learnt, was a student, the
other a mentor, the next, a
dear friend from her days at
Central St Martin’s – so much
for meritocracy.
Regrettable though it is,
that the Exhibition for all its
dreams of openness should
fall prey to the entrenched
ethos of the ‘old boys’
network’ is somewhat to be
expected. Royal Academi-
cians, the artists elected as
members of the Royal Acad-
emy, including Tracey Emin
and Norman Ackroyd, expect
to be exhibited at the institu-
tion’s headline show. We may
as exhibition-goers be missing
out on the work of some
promising unknown artists,
but everything has its bene-
fits. The Summer Exhibitions
can often be a good way to
‘catch up’ with the big names
without committing to a solo
exhibition of their work.
These are rarely radical
new directions of work, but
solid examples in the vein
of an artist’s greatest hits.

“And I said I love you!”
proclaims one; confession or
rebuke? We’re never quite
sure; the ambiguity is part of
the charm, making the private
and personal public has
always been at the centre of
Emin’s work. In another room,
Michael Craig-Martin’s flat,
vibrant illustrations of house-
hold objects return – a tennis
racquet rendered in jewel
tones, in another instance
a violin; each a cheery,
two-dimensional equivalent
of Duchamp’s ready-mades –
precise and bright.
Different coordinators take
responsibility for the curation
of different spaces. One of
the standout rooms belongs
to Yinka Shonibare. His walls
are painted in sumptuous
burnt orange; the colour
of the best kind of tomato
soup, the colour of slow
burning embers. Against this
striking backdrop Shonibare
has hung some of the most
vibrant, memorable works of
the exhibition. His own Venus
de’Medici stands in a corner,
a traditional Venus cast
covered in yellow and red
African textile, her head a
painted geographical globe.
More than any other room
Shonibare’s is international,
with a focus on portraits, one
filled with humanity. There are
some fantastic large works; a
canvas of the Henna Bikers by
Hassan Hajjaj dominates on
one side, and in the centre,
two thrones assembled by
Gonçalo Mabunda in an
Afro-tribal style from flat-
tened bullets and grenades
and other weapons of war
hold court.
Less imposing in size but
no less bold in artistry are
Taigen, Monika, Larry,
Dasha, Rosie, and Kadeem
and Kyrone, denizens of
London’s East End recreated
in wonderfully intricate
painted wooden sculptures
by Tomoaki Suzuki. They're
brimming with energy and
life, mixing modernity of
character with the deeply
traditional craft.
There’s always a lot to take
in at the Summer Exhibition,
works are crammed in Tetris-
style, frame upon frame,
sometimes five or six works
high; smaller works tend to
get a little lost. The print room
can often be a source of
hidden treasures: Ackroyd’s
unassuming monochrome
prints of cliffs and seascapes
are always a delight, and a
delicate oil of a Pale Green
Hydrangea by Melanie Miller
is tucked away in a corner –
it’s worth seeking it out for its
meticulous brushwork and use
of muted tones in the tradition
of the Old Masters. Worth
seeing too is the architecture
room in which a host of con-
struction diagrams toe the line
between technical illustrations
and works of geometric art.
The undisputed highlight of
the show is the video installa-
tion WESTERN UNION: Small
Boats by Turner-nominated
Issac Julien, who is this year’s
Wollaston Award winner. A
haunting narrative of wealth,
decline, and migration plays
out over five screens; a big
white house stands by the
Sicilian coast, well-to-do fam-
ilies sun themselves amongst
the rocks surrounding it,
some lean, tanned men dive
gracefully into the impossibly
blue waters. We see a close
up of some sandy toes, as
the camera pans away we
see they belong not to a sun-
bather, but a body covered
in metallic foil, one figure in a
row of many. Scenes of deca-
dence are interrupted by ones
of tragedy – men, sapped
of all their energy, are cast
adrift on small boats, others
drown in the waters that
only moments ago looked so
peaceful. Julien completed
this work in 2007 but it has
never before been exhibited.
A decade on, the images of
stark inequality are more rel-
evant than ever. The opulent
interiors of the Royal Acad-
emy lend an extra dimension
to the work, immersing us
further in the world that Julien
has constructed.
The Summer Exhibition is
often like a good summer
blockbuster: frequently action
packed, high on sugary froth
but light on emotional reso-
nance. Julien and Mabunda’s
work shows that this art world
summer fixture can be much
more.
