Rude.
Fact.
More facts.
We forgot. Literally
lost track of all the
times Jack Steadman
got up on stage.
It’s funny ‘cos you’re
in charge of lights.
No.
Who’s this now?
Also no.
It was in fact a
banner ad with one
week’s notice as a
prerequisite.
Trust me, you don’t
want my liquid
tributes.
Ugh. Fine.
Oh I know *wink*
Life is pain.
Hey, we actu-
ally had to sit
through the MD’s
speech and then
transcribe it. We
suffered enough.

Anonymous sources have revealed,
that DramSoc used a nefarious online
wordart generator to create their ad
because “They couldn’t make it ugly
enough”.

Good morning,
I happened to be using the most recent issue of your
fine publication in the manner to which it is most
suited (that is, as a floor covering when painting),
whereupon I stumbled upon an article written by your
most esteemed editor, a man of both excellent taste
and pelage. It covered, in most excruciating detail,
the comings and goings of the recent Union Awards
ceremony, even going so far as to quote verbatim
the wise words of our Managing Director for some
three paragraphs (an excellent way of expanding the
article without having to actually write anything, by
the way).
Given that this article embodies the servitude to fine
attention to detail for which this publication is well
known, it came as quite some surprise that, when
listing recipients of the nine categories of awards,
notable by its omission was the award for CSP of the
year, which as I am sure you will know was awarded
to Imperial College Dramatic Society (colloquially
known as DramSoc, that fine society of great repute).
To be spurned in such a way is not to be taken lightly,
and I look forward to the following being printed in
your next issue:
An admission that DramSoc is, in fact, the best (and
objectively so).
An admission that Mistifer Cat, DramSoc’s feline
mascot, is superior to felix, yours.
A full-page advert, as previously offered to the soci-
ety in return for services rendered. The artwork for
said advert is attached.
This letter, in full, with the below diagram by way of
illustration.
Tributes in liquid form are also gratefully received in
the Union Bar on Tuesday evenings.
Please do keep up the vital, vital work you carry out
as a stalwart bastion of journalism.
I remain, respectfully, yours,
Sir Walter
