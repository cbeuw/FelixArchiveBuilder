I
only went on a holiday for a
few weeks and already this
damp rag is looking thinner
than a mid-30s past-her-prime
housewife whose husband
lost all sexual interest a long
time ago but who still believes it
can be groped back by digging
her nails into her fleeting youth.
Or insert a more concise tasteless
joke about anorexia. Whatever
floats your boat. In an attempt to
help bulk this issue out, in a feature
that nobody was asking for, I have
decided to write my column for this
week only.
Well that election was a cock-up
wasn’t it? I can’t believe that the
entire gamble didn’t work out.
UKIP didn’t win a single seat! It’s
almost as if the entirety of the
country has deemed the party
completely irrelevant. I really
honestly thought that the anti-mus-
lim rhetoric would resonate with
the people of Great Britain, but
apparently the same racism that
works across the atlantic, doesn’t
work here. Perhaps we need
to find a new ethnic minority to
stigmatize – I’ve heard the Greeks
are shifty looking. All that hair
those people have will make it far
easier to profile them in airports.
Plus they break plates wherever
they go so you’d be aware of any
nearby Greeks and could protect
your crockery accordingly.
After the disappointment of not
being able to crush more snow-
flake liberals, I decided to take a
holiday in order to put my mind
at ease. Like all patriotic Brits,
I decided to leave the country
because the weather here is shite.
I visited the exotic shores of Kavos,
as it provides the illusion of being
somewhere nice, without being too
far from a Wetherspoons.
Although there was the oppor-
tunity to sample the local cuisine,
I have a particular aversion to
eating bottom feeding creatures
served by equally attractive
foreigners. I instead spent the
time sampling the delights of egg
and chips in the local Irish pub. I
received uninvited suggestions of
some cultural shite to do whilst on
the island; however, I’ve been to
the British Museum once and since
we’ve stolen loads from the whole
world, there is no need to see
anything else.
On a serious note I once had
a friend who went to Kavos as a
virgin, but when she came back
she had had relations with nine
men in seven days and came back
with chlamydia, so If you do go
to Kavos be prepared for the last
days of Rome on all beaches. Stay
safe out there, but stay sexy.
A
s you all read
this column, you
will currently be
standing in the
people’s republic of
Kensington. Long
live Corbyn, long live the red state,
and death to all Torys. As you can
probably tell, I am off my tits on
socialist splendour and victory. Like
millions of Labour voters, not only
do I not understand economics,
but I also don’t understand the fact
that Labour actually lost. I mean of
course we took the Conservative
majority, but we also created a
coalition that is possibly so far
to the right, it makes Marine the
pen look like an advocate of
multiculturalism. But still! Fuck Nick
Clegg! The sight of his sad little
eyes made the extensive student
loan debt that I have acquired feel
a little lighter.
Riding on the elation of nothing
significant occurring in this elec-
tion, I propelled myself into a well
deserved vacation from all my
hard work, sharing articles from
The Canary. In many ways, Jezza
has a lot to thank me for. Anyway I
decided to travel to the untouched
by white tourists destination of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, having
only learnt of its existence from
Eurovision. Upon arriving in
Sarajevo, I quickly bartered with a
bus driver (using the Yugoslavian I
had learnt from Duolingo) to take
me as far away from anyone that
speaks English so that I could get
a truly authentic experience of
Bosnia. Unfortunately it seems as
though my 76% fluency on the app
did not really translate to actual
ability to speak the language. I
also quickly learned that there are
several ISIS cells within Bosnia, a
Muslim majority country. Frankly
I was bowled over by the cultural
appropriation of a country, taking
a religion of peace that is owned
by brown people and starting
to practice it, but that is a minor
quibble. If I had a main complaint,
it would be the fact I was held
hostage for a few weeks.
After boarding the bus, I was
greeted by an utterly authentic
Bosnian terrorist called Anđelko
who told me that he would shoot
me if I tried to run – the customs
of Eastern Europe are so exotic!
I survived on a traditional diet of
Bosnian gruel, which they assured
me was vegan, which in turn put
my worries over the miscellaneous
bones I found amongst the lumps
to rest. After a life changing six
weeks, I was eventually released
as apparently my family didn’t
want to pay any ransom – what
a bunch of pranksters. I returned
back to London with new friends
and new experiences. If any of you
feel like getting kidnapped by ISIS,
I would totally recommend the
experience.
I celebrated the red
revolution by going on
a soul-searching trip to
Eastern Europe
Jowen Nones had the best six
weeks of his life held hostage by
ISIS
I went to Kavos for
Holidays in Britain,
but with better
weather

ing one’s self in the native culture
is a load of shit
