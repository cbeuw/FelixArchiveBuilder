‘A detective story without a detec-
tive’ is one of the numerous taglines
that have accompanied this adapta-
tion of one of Agatha Christie’s most
famous novels. It’s easy enough to
see why the story itself has been so
popular - it is brilliantly imaginative
– indeed, it would be hard to imagine
anyone else who could invent a situ-
ation where everybody is both the
detective and a suspect, make the
child’s nursery rhyme ‘Ten Little
Soldier Boys’ have such grisly impor-
tance and create a body count more

impressive than Shakespeare’s.
The story itself starts off inno-
cently enough with some guests
making polite conversation over
dinner as they wait for their delayed
host. However, it rapidly transpires
that they have been lured to din-
ner on a deserted island for far
more sinister purposes as one by
one they gradually start encoun-
tering fatal ‘accidents’ as the ten
soldiers on the mantelpiece also dis-
appear – prompting revelations of
dark secrets, and some of the most
satisfyingly terrifying theatre I have
ever seen. Part of the thrill for the
audience is wondering how Christie
will fulfil the prophetic role of the
Ten Little Soldier Boy rhyme – and I
challenge anyone who doesn’t know
the story at all to figure out ‘A red
herring swallowed one’ accurately.
(By the way, please don’t send in let-
ters to next week’s edition abusing
my mental ability if you do!)
This is a production that is com-
pletely engrossing (a new version
by Kevin Elyot which remains very
faithful to the book) not sugar-coat-
ing any of nastier elements to the
story. It is a little slow to start
off with, including some very non-
funny ‘silly’ dancing by Sam Crane
and Tara Fitzgerald. However, the
evening immediately livens up after
the classic ‘disembodied voice’
speaks, accusing all the assembled
of murders, followed rapidly by the
first, highly spectacular departure
of one of the accused.
After this, the revelations and
respective changes from people into
ex-people come thick and fast, along
with ever-increasing amounts of
tension. This tension was provided
in no small part by Gregory Clarke’s
brilliant sound effects, including a
truly terrifying hornet sound as well
as all the classics of a murder mys-
tery, thunder, gunshots and some
very effective screaming. This com-
bined with lighting that plays on all
our childhood fears of shadows and
the dark, and follows the excellent
rule that ‘it’s not what you see but
what you think you’ll see that scares
you most,’ as well as some highly
dramatic special effects manage to
crank up the tension so much that
you feel almost as terrified as the
characters themselves.
As for the acting, well it was all
pretty excellent too really, though
I felt that Gemma Jones (as spin-
ster Emily Brent) could have given
her character much more terrify-
ing coldness rather than playing up
the doddery-old-lady effect quite so
much, and Sam Crane was a lit-
tle too shrilly hyperactive as idiotic
rich-boy Anthony Marston.
The main acting credits go to John
Ramm as the unfortunate butler
providing most of the humour, and
Tara Fitzgerald as Vera Claythorne
– sexy, intense and perfectly convey-
ing her transformation from a con-
fident modern young woman of the
1930s to a terrified creature, more
than slightly derailed by events, and
able to…well, I won’t give away the
ending.

The Schweppes Photographic
Portrait Prize is the predecessor of
the ‘John Kobal’ award which is one
of photography’s most distinguished
competitions. It definitely follows in
those fantastic footsteps with sixty
brilliant and totally different inter-
pretations of the theme ‘Portrait.’
The pieces on display have been
selected from six thousand works
which were submitted, and are by
photographers which come from
variety of different backgrounds,
including both professionals and
students, and even amateurs.
For the third year running, this
exhibition is bringing in crowds of
people, as aside from housing the
work of new and talented photog-
raphers, it is absolutely free. This
quality, when combined with the fact
that the exhibition includes portraits
ranging from the mildly disturbing

Until
to the arguably erotic, makes the
exhibition very appealing indeed!
Pieces aim to challenge our per-
ceptions and are not just superfi-
cial portraits. The photo of ‘Anabel
and Vikki’ depicts two unattractive,
butch, punk lesbians. The women
are standing close together with
the more masculine figure grab-
bing lustily at the breasts of the
other. This piece really questions
the glamorous modern day image
of lesbians.
Onestrikingportraitwas‘Rebecca’
by Shane Degan. His subject’s hair
is wild and tangled and is strewn
against her cheek joining her eye-
brow in a long dark curve. She is set
against white and pink Laveteria
flowers; their branches twist and
turn. Her skin tones mimic the col-
ours of the flowers, and her wild
hair follows the movement of the
branches. In her suburban settings
she is shown with as much beauty
and freedom as Laveteria flowers.
The winning photograph was ‘Girl
With a Baby’ by Shara Henderson, it
was taken on a photo shoot of local
children in the Polish industrial town
of Brzeg Dolny. The portrait shows a
barefooted girl of about 6years old
holding a baby of about her size. The
artist states her aim when taking
photos as to ‘show a side that people
do not see or happen to overlook.’
Despite the winning photo being
very effective, my favourite was
‘Amy and Jack’ by fourth prize win-
ner Magnus Reed. It shows Jack
out of focus in the foreground whose
body divides the photograph in half.
Behind him stands Amy who is
clearly in focus, she stares at him
tentatively, with bracelets dangling
gently from her wrists and her hands
placed in the pockets of her jeans.By
dividing the photograph into two
halves, Reed is putting emphasis on
each person having an equal part of
the interaction. The photographer
remarks, ‘Amy and Jack had never
met but they soon started interact-
ing. I wanted to remind people what
it was like to be 12/13, to view things
as they really are.’
Thoughtful comments on society
and culture, a bit of humour and
quite simply beautiful photography
make this exhibition very enjoyable.
I would recommend this to every-
one.
