ALBUM REVIEWS
Incredibly this band doesn’t sound
like a band called Film School, i.e.
they don’t sound like Test Icicles
or Art Brut. Instead they make a
hypnotic semi-drone-rock kind of
noise. On & On in particular swirls
around and around, drawing you in
to its repeated rhythms with heavily
delayed guitars. They are fond of
using the trick that many, ahem, nu-
shoegaze (sorry) bands use, namely
defining the chorus not by getting
louder or changing the tune, but just
by adding more layers of noise.
Harmed is really very good, and
pulls away from the fuzzy sounds
found elsewhere on this sampler.
The melody starts bouncy and
defined, until the chorus rapidly
bursts onto the scene with circling,
almost psychedelic guitars, distort-
ed variously to white noise, or to
sound like organs.
Less good is Pitfalls, let down
mainly by its use of simplistic bass
lines and annoying sliding guitar.
Also, I’ve always thought that mess-
ing around with the settings on a
keyboard is best down before a song,
not during it. 11:11 brings the quality
back, despite initially sounding like
post-punk by numbers. Those trade-
mark guitars that sound like they
were strummed ten minutes before
any sound was made are all over
the track, as is a feeling of tension
and disquiet. A simple motif is con-
stantly and absorbingly repeated,
right until the very end as the good
ol’ wall of noise grows and grows.
And grows some more.
Film School’s name is misleading,
their place of origin is misleading
(San Francisco, not exactly home of
innovation), but their sound certain-
ly isn’t. One to watch , and probably
brilliant live.

The Mars Volta live experience is
very different to the albums they
produce. TMV take a much more
fluid role during live shows, often
opting for 20 minute jamming ses-
sions between album tracks. Having
seen them in early 2005 on the
Frances The Mute tour, where they
performed the entire gig with no
supports in an epic two and a half
hour hour set, I felt I knew what to
expect from new live compilation
Scab Dates.
The album begins with one of
Omar Rodriguez Lopez’s sound
experiments; it sounds like a woman
speaking over a tannoy while instru-
ments are tuned in. Presumably this
is symbolic of the audience waiting
for TMV to begin their set. This
slowly melts into Take The Vein
Cerpin Taxt which is an extended
and free-flowing version of the track
from the early EP Tremulant. In
this version, TMV take more time to
explore themselves and their track
with extended soloing and a sinis-
ter accordion ‘solo’ that breaks the
track. Cavigula and Harsupex take
the form of live jam sessions and
really demonstrate their musical
talent. These tracks serve as ten-
sion builders for the album tracks,
Concertina, Take The Vein Cerpin
Taxt and Cicatriz that form the
majority of the album and they work
well as such.
Cicatriz itself is a 40 minute epic
split into 5 distinct parts. The first
part is eight minutes long beginning
much like the album version of the
track but drifting gently off course
towards the latter half into frequent
organ and guitar solos. This soon
flows into the second part - a much
slower and relaxed portion. The
slowness is broken near the end
by some psychedelic guitar soloing
that culminates in the switch to the
third part. Part II - as it is called
- is started with some audience
cheers and quiet blues-like guitar
riffs under Lopez’s exhaustive vocal
gymnastics. With some impressive
instrumental work in the last two
parts of this marathon track, TMV
come to the end of this impressive,
if slightly egotistical, 72 minute live
compilation.
Scab Dates feels like the album
De-loused In The Crematorium was
intended to be with TMV being far
more willing to experiment in live
performances leading to the long
jams that take over many songs-
much as in Frances The Mute. This
CD however will definitely not win
over many newcomers who have
not seen the somewhat magical live
experience of TMV live.

SINGLE REVIEWS
Sound the “yet another male singer
songwriter” alarm. I tentitivly put
the CD in my hi-fi, Bluntly expect-
ing a song of Damien like evil. My
relief is total when I find that Tim
Williams creates vaguely epic, heav-
ily atmospheric songs, in the style of
Tom McRae’s softest moments. My
Brooklyn is gorgeous, in a beauti-
fully understated way. Mr Williams
makes up for his lack of vocal range
with a breathy romanticism, and
exquisite use of space. Everything
has a warm and dreamy quality, akin
to watching the world from under-
water.
A, the other track on the CD, is a
pretty standard acoustic strum, but
not gratingly annoying like so many
of the boring men with guitars out
there. It’s a shame that he doesn’t
make it over to our shores very
often, but it’s maybe for the best if
his home (Brooklyn) inspires him to
write such exemplary music.
James Millen
Nottingham quintet Computerman
make an achingly fashionable noise.
The synths are glitzy like The
Killers, the guitars are sharp and
fast like Bloc Party and the vocals
are of the sincerely yearning sort
you hear all over the place. Still,
underneath it all the bands name
checked above are pretty ace. No
More Broken Hearts is obviously
their flagship song, with a driv-
ing rhythm, emo harmonies, and
a suitably energetic chorus. Oddly,
they take to pronouncing words
strangely (not just a dialect thing,
since Midlandsers are sometimes
indecipherable to my south coast
ears, they add syllables all over the
place), possibly for novelty factor
for more plays on MTV2. There’s
a lush bit with handclaps though.
Watch More Television, found
lurking on the flip side, tries a little
too hard. There are too many stops
and starts, and an irritating tune in
the chorus. No Recover delves too
far into the dark depths of emo, with
a worrying injection of glam that
makes it all sound a bit King Adora.
Certainly not bad, definitely not
offensive, undoubtedly better than
The Bravery (as are genital warts),
but nothing new. Or exciting.
Meh.

Reading rock ‘n’ rollers Yankee
Nine Niner are making waves in the
U.K music scene-quoted as saying
they are here to “awaken us from our
sleepyKeaneandColdplayslumber.”
Yankee Nine Niner and their two
track sampler simply rock. Where
The Darkness have seen fit to par-
ody the staples of 80’s rock Yankee
Nine Niner have grabbed them with
both hands and embraced them.
Oh Yeah has a great feel with
jazz chords and metal inspired solos
sprinkled over the croaky, almost
grainy, vocals of singer Henry
Rundell.ThisisaclassicRock‘n’Roll
track wrapped up with some great
jazz guitar work. Giving Up is more
about the vocal, the track begins
with a slow paced breezy intro fad-
ing smoothly into Aerosmith-esque
vocals that saves it from being
entirely unremarkable. The track is
much less impressive than Yankee
Nine Niner seem to be and is a bit
of a let down compared to other
tracks (www.purvolume.com/yan-
keenineniner). I look forward to a
solid EP release from them to keep
the likes of The Darkness at bay.
