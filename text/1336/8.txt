e’ve seen him play
the curiously facial-
hair lacking Mr Willy
Wonka in Charlie
and The Chocolate
Factory, this time round, in a movie
Johnny Depp claimed to be close to
his own personal history, he is the
morally corrupted womanizer the
Earl of Rochester.
Set against the shocking and sen-
sual backdrop of the Restoration,
The Libertine follows the story of
John Wilmot, the second earl of
Rochester. He is the libertine of the
generation: rebellious, scandalous
without a regard for any social taboo
or restriction. Strangely enough, he
is very much revered for his eccen-
tricity. So King Charles II asks for
his help to boost the royal highness’
popularity among his loyal subjects.
However, the earl is tired of his
libertine status. From a wine bot-
tle, he seeks solace from the per-
sistent dullness and emptiness that
has confined him all his life. He
meets Elizabeth Barry (Samantha
Morton), a plain but fiery actress
wannabe. He makes her his protégé
despite his friends’ many protesta-
tions. As a result, his social status
falls from the sky to the murky pits
as she rises to become England’s
biggest star in the theatrical world.
In his alcoholic daze, he writes a
play of dildoes and of kings who can’t
get it up. He is charged with mak-
ing a mockery of the king and he
disguises himself as a bogus doctor
to save his own life. Unfortunately
for him, his sexual misadventures
have chosen this time to punish
him. Elizabeth, his beloved theatre
darling also abandons him since she
has now achieved the star status
she has so coveted and has no use
for a crippled earl. Fortunately for
him, his wife Elizabeth (Rosamund
Pike) remains true to his bedside
while his body self-destructs from
past indulgences.
From a critique’s point of view,
the story isn’t a unique one. Hence,
the director’s choice to make this
into a film isn’t exactly an inspired
decision. Fortunately for the direc-
tor, he has Johnny Depp’s talents to
fall back on. However, is a one-man
show enough to make this film spec-
tacular?
Personally, I have always been a
fan of Johnny Depp and there were
a scattering of memorable scenes in
the film. One of them was a shot of
the earl lying helpless in his chair,
pissing onto the floor as he had lost
the ability to control his own blad-
der. When his wife enters the room,
he tries in vain to assume a more
dignified position. However, his wife
can see all the horrible marks his
disease has left on him. Hurt and
frustrated, Elizabeth spits out her
displeasure with his self-destructing
tendencies. Nevertheless, for all his
bastardly ways, she loves him and
stays to help him until death comes
to take him away.

who have not yet seen his role as the
maniacal pirate in Pirates of the
Caribbean. However, an emotional,
seeker of life’s meaning earl is too
much of a cliche. He’s depressed,
fine. He finds his life meaningless,
too bad. Seriously, this story is just
a horribly overdone steak: dry and
tough to swallow. The only perk was
that this story was easier to follow
When a man thinks with his heart and not his dick he’s in for a spot of trouble.

than the other depressing films I’ve
seen. The director could still have
captured the mood of the film better
if there was some internal narrative
in the film.
In a nutshell, it’s not your typical
entertainment channel type of film
but its a poetic and artistic wannabe
that might appeal to some of you out
there. Watch it if you love Johnny
Depp or if you have no idea of
Johnny Depp’s greatness. It’s a film
that’s bound to make you a Johnny
Depp convert but it’s definitely not
his most fantastic film to date.

Foreign ﬁlm of the week: Atash
It deﬁnitely pleased the critics in the Cannes Film Festival, but what about Felix?
Atash
Director: Tawfik Abu Wael
Starring: Hussein Yassin Mahajne,
Amal Bweerat and Roba Blal.
Length: 110minutes
Certificate:12A
Released:25 Novermber 2005

W
hat do you think when
I tell you that Atash is
an Isreali/Palestinian
film? First thing that
comes to mind is
probably suicide-bombers and reli-
gious conflicts. However, Atash is
definitely not the movie you have
in mind.
Surprisingly enough, Atash is just
a simple family story. Abu Shukri
(Hussein Yassin Mahajne) is the
head of the family and he rules with
an iron-fist. However, it’s not just a
story of children living under his tyr-
anny because he is in fact a tender,
loving father at heart.
The crux of the story is the loca-
tion of their home. They use to stay
in town, where they had proper elec-
tricity and Abu had a proper job to
feed his family. However, Gamila,
his eldest daughter ( Roba Blal) was
raped. The penalty for being a rape
victim: death. To save his daughter
from this untimely and horrible fate,
he relocates his family to the middle
of nowhere.
However, conditions are harsh and
ten years later, the children and the
mother rebel against their father.
The situation might have been dif-
ferent if Abu did not coerce his fam-
ily into giving up school and other
aspects of their social life to make
and sell charcoal. Nevertheless,
what’s done is done.
The acting is realistic and the story
is eye-opening. It’s a refreshing take
on the Palestinian society; a society
terribly misunderstood due to the
wars that has taken over their lives.
I loved the film for its authenticity.
Nevertheless, it’s not an easy film
to understand. However, American
films are easy to understand and
most of them are crap. So take a
chance on Atash!
