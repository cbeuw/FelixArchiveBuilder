stretching across the globe, allow-
ing us to be trained by some of the
best Capoeiristas in the world. We
currently have academies in the UK,
USA, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Costa
Rica, Puerto Rico and Brazil. The
man in charge of the UK branch is
Formado ‘Polvo’, our instructor who
also allows us to attend his private
lessons in Chelsea and Ladbroke
Grove outside of college hours. Other
Abolição representatives (Graduado
‘Duplo’ and Graduado ‘Madimbu’)
also allow us to train with them
in Brixton, Bow and Vauxhall. So
coupled with the lessons held in col-
lege, IC Capoeiristas have plenty of
opportunities to enhance their skills
in this art.
Last week however, Capoeira
Abolição UK had its annual Batizado
– a one-week workshop put on by our
Master - Mestre Delei ‘Kaçula’, end-
ing with a ceremony for those who
have earned their first belt (corda)
and are “baptised” as Capoeiristas,
and for those who have earned a
higher corda. Mestre trains three
times a day at his academy in Miami,
and also travels to all other acad-
emies throughout the world giv-
ing these Batizados, allowing each
Capoeirista to train with the best
Capoeirista in Abolição. Amazingly,
he was awarded his black belt at just
20 years of age.
Some members of IC Capoeira
took part in the main event, learn-

Salve! Most of you might not have
heard about the Afro-Brazilian mar-
tial art of Capoeira, so you probably
don’t know that we have our own
Capoeira Society here at Imperial.
Well, allow me to explain…
It all began in the ‘slave-trade’
in the 16th Century; people were
kidnapped from Africa and sold as
slaves in Brazil. Those captured
devised a plan to free themselves
from the shackles of slavery – they
weren’t permitted to train in any
fighting arts or skills, so created a
new martial art disguised as a dance.
This is how Capoeira was born. In
the game, Capoeiristas gather in
a circle (roda) with various instru-
ments at the head of the roda play-
ing tribal music. The Capoeiristas
clap and sing to the music, whilst
two people play Capoeira to the
rhythm in the centre of the roda.
It has always been played in the
streets and on the beaches of Brazil,
but now has reached every corner
of the planet.
Capoeira is a martial art full of fluid
and dynamic movements of attack
and counter-attack, with some awe-
some acrobatics thrown into the mix
too. The finished display is a beauti-
ful blend of music, singing, dance,
attack/counter-attack and the tradi-
tions of those who created Capoeira.
It is quite simply a martial art unlike
anything you will have ever seen
before.
Our society is affiliated to Capoeira
Abolição, a group of Capoeiristas

ing valuable new skills from Mestre
and earning their first cordas (corda
verde), with one earning his second
corda (corda amarelo). For the other
members not in the Batizado, Mestre
arranged a special class so that they
didn’t miss out on this amazing oppor-
tunity to train with him.
Mestre Delei, like all Masters of
any martial art, insists on absolute
perfection in practicing our martial
art, as well as complete dedication to
the group and to Capoeira generally.
It was the most exhausting lesson
we have ever had in college, but well
worth the aching muscles the next
day.

to attack or counter-attack your
opponent, but the art of Capoeira
is only really seen the roda, and
at the end of this special lesson
Mestre Delei invited us to create a
roda with him. Some of the group
had only been playing Capoeira
for one month, so the opportunity
to play against him was unbeliev-
able! He tested our skills, know-
ing some had only played for one
month, and gave everyone a taste
of true Capoeira played by some-
one who has devoted their life to
Capoeira Abolição. For those who
were looking to earn their first
corda, he tested them a bit more,
trying to see if they were worthy of
the corda verde.
For the rest of the Batizado, the
group had longer training sessions
with Mestre (some running for over
three hours) with some music and
singing lessons thrown in to com-
plete the training. A Capoeirista
not only needs to be skilled in
acrobatic and fluid movements, but
must also be capable of playing the
various instruments used in the
roda – the atabaque (floor-stand-
ing drum), pandeiro (tambourine)
and the berimbau (like a long bow
with a wooden bowl at one end
– the music is played by hitting
the string and changing the pitch
with a stone), as well as knowing
the songs and different rhythms of
the game.
If you would like to know more
about Capoeira, why not come
and try a class? We meet every
Monday in the Union Gym at 6pm,
running till 7:30pm. You can get
more details by emailing us at
capoeira@imperial.ac.uk.
