W
ell, this article has
been a long time in
production, and I’m
surprised that this
hasn’t been highlight-
ed in a letter yet. I suppose that I’m
just one of the few people left who
care about such things.
“What’s the point of this article?”
I hear you all cry, or I imagine you
do. Shout it a little louder, and I may
just explain. Are you sitting comfort-
ably? Then we’ll begin.
The week before last, I was read-
ing through my usual copy of Felix
(1334), armed with my usual red
pen. I’ve got into the habit of trawl-
ing through our dearly beloved
paper, picking out the various little
things that the editor has missed
in his rush to write half the articles
and publish it. Then, to my horror,
I arrived at the Nightlife section. It
was at that point that I very nearly
gave up on the the use of the English
language, the world in general, and
editors in particular.
I’ll ask a question here, and I hope
that not too many of you get it wrong.
Here goes: how do you spell “beer”?
If you answered B-E-A-R (twice),
then you should be very ashamed
of yourself. Beer is pretty much the
single most important word in the
student vocabulary. On the other
hand, people might have started giv-
ing out teddy bears for a quick flash
of one’s breasts – if so, nobody told
me about it. If you make this sort
of mistake, you certainly should not
be editing a section in the student
paper (or working in Hamley’s, for
that matter).
Poor spelling aside, some of
the paragraphs barely make any
sense at all. Has anyone writing
for Felix heard of sentence con-
struction, proofreading, or common
sense? Judging from some articles,
the answer is a resounding “no”. If
this is the standard of spelling and
grammar of the editors, how much
damage is done to the articles that
they edit? This isn’t a rant against

How can informing the students of
a ridiculous dress code be deemed
“an overreaction”, when the matter
has caused such a stir as to make
it into several national newspapers
including yesterday’s Guardian
and BBC news.
If this a matter for “mature
debate” why weren’t, we, the stu-
dents consulted for such a debate
before the policy was put in place?
College seem to believe they can
go around making autocratic deci-
sion without so much as a by-your-
leave to the students. The students,
and more importantly, the Union

Rupert, as he does have a lot to do,
and there’s hardly anybody writing
for Felix. Writing most of the stories
and editing the whole newspaper
is a lot for one person to manage,
and it shouldn’t just be one person
doing this. An editor’s job is, sur-
prisingly, to edit. Felix represents
the student population at Imperial.
If Felix is anything to go by, then
we’re almost illiterate, barely able
to string together a coherent para-
graph, and only one or two people
do all the work.
I have no time or space to mention
all of the numerous errors that they
must have fought tooth and nail to
force past computer spell-checkers.
I know Felix has at least one copy
editor (one of my housemates), and
he does well when he has the time. It
takes too much time to fix all of the
stupid mistakes that people make in
their articles, and it shouldn’t have
to be that way, even if they are writ-
ten at 3am.
Why are people not taught how
to spell and punctuate any more?
We’re no longer taught the rules
of grammar at school. Let me give
you an example to illustrate how
bad things are (putting Felix aside
for the moment). My girlfriend is at
Royal Holloway, and is a first-year
English student. Part of the work
she was given last week was an
exercise in putting apostrophes in
the correct place and identifying all
of the verbs, nouns, adjectives and
adverbs in an extract from a book.
This is not what either of us expect-
ed from a degree-level course: it’s
more suited to 7-year-olds learning
how to write our language.
Reading through old editions of
Felix on the website gave me an
insight into the past. Felix used to be
funny. It used to have great writers
and was well-respected by the stu-
dents. The writers used to be able
to spell. Please, let’s try to return to
that golden age once more.
Perhaps next week, a lesson in
basic English.

need to make our views heard.
Its is encouraging to see that
students are taking action in
these matters, there have been
two protests in as many weeks,
against the dress code and noisy
Bioengineering lecturers.
Elections Farce
Will Union elections ever proceed
without hold-ups and bickering?
Felix can’t remember a time when
ICU elections passed without
incident. Spam emailing seems to
cause problems just about every
time they hold elections, shouldn’t
the Union just ban candidates from
campaigning via email altogether?
At least the Union isn’t fining stu-
dents for grafting the streets with
chalk.
New ‘Southside’ bar
The students loved Southside
bar and were very sad to see it
lost, lets hope that although the
Harrington Bar & Grill “is not a
Southside replacement” it will be
just as good.
It is important that students have
an alternative to the Union. In
previous years the Union has failed
to impress students, who instead
frequented Southside.
At present the Union is much
busier than it has been in previous
years lets hope that this is due to
the Union showing the students a
good time and not simply a case of
their being no alternatives.
Remove that hoody or we’ll shoot!
Hoodies - not actually the police’s
top priorities.
