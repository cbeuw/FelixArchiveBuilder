Elections
I realised that I hadn’t put the Union election results into Felix yet. The results
have been available on www.union.ic.ac.uk and are:
The result for the Equal Opportunities officer was announced on Friday
– Emma Persky is the winner.
Results for the Faculty/Department elections can be seen at www.union.ic.ac.
uk and have been publicised through the faculties.
This year’s Council & committee elections saw the highest number of can-
didates standing and an improved Electronic Voting system. Thank you to all
of you who took part and had a say in the way the Union is run. We had over
1,000 students voting, which is very close to the record number of votes re-
ceived during last year’s Council & committee elections.
However many of you will be aware that the results for the candidates standing
for ordinary member of Council could not be counted on the same day as for
the others above. Instead it has had to wait until this month’s Council meeting
for the results to be counted.
The reason for this was not to do with the Electronic Voting system, but due to
complaints about students who appeared to have broken election regulations.
Once this issue was highlighted, we had to investigate it. It’s taken a while to
investigate because the number of people involved (both as those complained
against and those investigating) was large so anything took time. The data that
were needed took time to collate, as they came from various sources, and had
to be pieced together for a determination of what had happened and what the
decision regarding the standing of certain candidates would be.

New Cash Machine in Beit
Good news - over the Christmas holidays, the Union will have its very own Cash Machine installed! This has been offered by College to improve the cash ma-
chine facilities on campus and will be ready for the new term. But don’t worry, it will NOT be one of the machines that charge - it will be free to use.

To hear the latest about the redevelopment and to give your feedback, take a look at pages linked from www.union.ic.ac.uk or have a look at the display in the
