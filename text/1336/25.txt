Steve’s Verdict
What where your first thoughts
when you saw Wayway?
Seemed humourous enough.
Good to get along with on a rather
impromptu evening out.
Did you fancy her?
To be honest, no. Nothing wrong
with her, it’s just I normally take a
while to realise I like someone.
Did you like the restaurant?
Food was excellent, staff were
friendly. I believe that IC students
get a 20% discount so get your
arses down there now.
What would you give the date out
of 10
7.5
Will you be seeing her again?
Well, another Felix bar night is just
around the corner. Perhaps we’ll
next meet in slightly less civilised
surroundings.
And Finally the question everyone
wants ask, did you kiss?
No. The romantic mood was some-
what soured by the sight of the
morbidly obese gentleman sitting
to our right.
Wayway’s Verdict
What were your first thoughts when
you saw Steve?
He had a good sense of humour.
Very nice sounding Scottish accent.
Did you fancy him?
Umm, not immediately no. We could
be good friends, I don’t think more
than that. We share a GSOH, it was
definitely fun chatting toi him
What did you think of the meal?
Yes, very good nice atmosphere,
quite romantic, candles, good food,
service was excellent, company
was excellent.
Will you be seeing him again?
Yeah, why not.
What would you give him out of
10?
An 8.
Will you be seeing him again?
We’ll see.
And a kiss?
No, we had a good laugh though.
