Imperial College has received a
£4.9 million grant from the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation to design
a simple, affordable and effective
test to measure the health of victims
subject to HIV/AIDS in developing
countries.
In the fight to combat HIV/AIDS,
the crtical disease-fighting cells in
the blood; CD4+ and T-Lymphocytes
are often difficult to keep track of.
The “CD4 Initiative” aims to devel-
op a device to measure such dis-
ease-fighting cells in an easy to use
manner.
Current tests are expensive and
require infrastructure and expertise
which are often insufficient in devel-
oping countries, making sustained
productivity of such techniques dif-
ficult. It is therefore the objective of
this initiative to develop new tests
which are appropriate to such speci-
fications in hospitals and clinics in
Africa and other developing coun-

Elections
The Old Bailey heard on Monday, 21
November, how the daughter of fin-
ancier John Monckton witnessed her
parents being “brutally” attacked
near Imperial College halls. The
attack, last November (Felix 1308)
left her father dead.
Two suspects, Damien Hanson and
Elliot White, both 24, are currently
on trial for murder and wounding
with intent. Richard Horwell for the
prosecution said witnesses saw
the men fleeing the scene on 29
November 2005. The attacks took
place minutes away from Evelyn
Gardens, the location of Imperial
College halls of residence, in a three
storey townhouse on Upper Cheyne
Row, Chelsea.
The attackers left both Mr.
Monckton, 49 and his wife Homeyra,
46 with several knife wounds to the
chest and back. Monckton later died
at Chelsea and Westminster hospital
whilst his wife underwent intensive
surgery, she eventually recovered.
The court heard how Monckton,
head of bonds management at Legal
and General was “tricked” into
opening the door to White, who was
posing as a Royal Mail employee.
White then forced his way into the
house breaking a security chain on
the door with the help of Hanson
dressed in a balaclava and brandish-
ing a knife and firearm, it is alleged.
Hanson demand jewellery and cash
from Ms Monckton.
The prosecution claims that
Hanson stabbed Ms Monckton in the
back several times as she reached
for the panic alarm, before turning
his attention to Mr Monckton. The
pair left the house very soon after-
ward, leaving with only a few small
items of jewellery. The defence
suggested that Mr White was at
the scene of the crime as his blood
was found at the house and he fully
admits to the charges of robbery
but denies murder. The court heard
that there is no scientific evidence to
place Hanson at the murder scene.
The trial continues.

tries.
Professor Stephen Smith,
Principal of the Faculty of Medicine
at Imperial College London, said:
“Despite the burden of HIV/AIDS
on the developing world, many of the
diagnostic tools are just not acces-
sible there due to the high cost
and complexity of use. This initiative
will help develop new, simple, rapid,
robust and affordable tools and help
remove one important barrier to the
effective implementation of AIDS
care in these countries.”.
News in Brief
Shortage of physic teachers
Physics education in England is in
steepdeclineaccordingtoresearch
at the University of Buckingham,
which found entries for physics A-
level had fallen by 38% since 1990,
despite average entries for A-lev-
els rising by 14.6%. Nearly 10% of
sixth forms in England do not offer
the subject at A level, and almost
40% of sixth forms enter five or
less candidates for exams. Half of
physics teachers hold no degree
qualifications in the subject at all.
What exactly discourages phys-
ics graduates from entering teach-
ing? Felix asked a few physics
undergraduates at Imperial their
views. The most popular reasons
for not entering teaching were the
low rates of pay and unenthusi-
astic pupils. Most sort careers in
banking and advertising.

Babar Ahmad protest
Last Friday, 18 November, an
impromptu protest took place after
Islamic Society Friday Prayers in the
Union building. It was in response to
news that Barbar Ahmad, a former
IT support technician at Imperial
College, was to be extradited to the
United States (Felix 1335). Around
sixty people protested at the deci-
sion, and signatures were collected
against the decision to extradite Mr
Ahmad. External press were present
from the Wandsworth Borough News
and Eastern Eye magazine.
An appeal against the decision to
extradite Mr Ahmad is planned by
the family, as is a protest for the 11
December in London. It was specifi-
cally noted that the protest was not
in any way against Imperial College
or the Student Union, but against
the decision for extradition by the
Home Secretary.

their mind” as to whether they were
guilty or not. Alam added, “Some of
the questions they asked were out
of order”, but he refused to supply
Felix with an example.
Another disqualified candidate,
Shazad Khalid, was even more criti-
cal of the Union Executive.” I will
not appeal against the Executive
decision by presenting my case
in Union Council. We cannot for-
get the situation that occurred last
year with Collin Smith’s campaign
in support of Baber Ahmed, [which]
caused the arrival of 6 security
guards before Council finally came
to their humane senses”, he told
Felix. “Since then, they have been
trying to re-claim credibility with
students. Unfortunately in doing
so, the Executive has been forced
to point the finger and place the
blame on some individuals, rightly
or wrongly,” he added.
The controversy is sure to con-
tinue, with Union council reconven-
ing this evening to announce the
final results of the election, and to
discuss the appeals launched by the
disqualified candidates.
