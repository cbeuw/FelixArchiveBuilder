Close Ups
The more astute of you may notice
that this is a shameless rip-off of one
of my coffee breaks from last year.
I don’t care. I like it.
Here’s some famous album / sin-
gle covers, and you have to tell us
the artist and title. Simple. There’s
two points for each answer, so good
luck.
Emails, as always, to coffee.
