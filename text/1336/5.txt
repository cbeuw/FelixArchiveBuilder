Women now represent approxi-
mately 50% of the 39.4 million living
with HIV worldwide, with higher
proportions (up to 60%) in the worst
affected areas such as Sub-Saharan
Africa.
In addition to an increased bio-
logical susceptibility to infection
(owing to significant mucous expo-
sure to seminal fluids), women are
at a greater risk due to issues of
gender inequality such as non-con-
sensual sex and the poverty-driven
need for commercial sex. The
well-known ABC mantra (Abstain,
Be faithful, use Condoms) is not
always applicable in developing
countries, where the decision to
use a condom often rests with
the male. Analyses looking at the
outcome of HIV infection based
on gender have highlighted a 33%
higher mortality rate in women
participating in various studies,
in part due to lack of access to
health care and social support.
Redressing the balance of power
is crucial if we are to lessen the
impact of HIV on this currently
vulnerable population.
It has been accepted that the
creation of a vaccine, the ‘holy
grail’ of HIV research, is still a
long way off and therefore improv-
ing preventative measures in
the meantime is paramount. The
development of vaginal micro-
bicides, as a method of reduc-
ing HIV transmission that gives
control to women, has stimulated
much interest. These are chemi-
cal agents (various forms such
as gels, creams, tablets and sup-
positories are available) used by a
woman before sexual intercourse.
Three types of compounds with
differing mechanisms of action are
currently being investigated. One
such chemical works by destroy-
ing the envelope surrounding
the virus. However, high toxicity
of such compounds may cause
local irritation and inflammation,
which could enhance
transmission of HIV
and other STDs. For
this reason, new
structures with lower
vaginal toxicity are
being developed.
Other polymers act
by blocking the entry
of HIV into cells, and
the third candidate
for a microbicide
acts by blocking
viral replication.
Women in develop-
ing countries do not
have the wealth of
contraceptive options
that are available in
the Western world, and so there is
potential to develop microbicides
with a spermicidal action, which
may increase their appeal for
women.
The rapid dissemination of HIV
infection must be stemmed and,
since heterosexual intercourse
represents the majority of newly
acquired infections, a preventative
method giving control to women
is highly desirable. However,
despite the potential held by vagi-
nal microbicides, there are many
issues surrounding the acceptabil-
ity of such a measure. Alongside
the need for clinical efficacy, it is
essential for social and behaviour-
al factors to be taken into account.
Studies of men in Zimbabwe and
South Africa have highlighted con-
cerns over safety and side effects
such as infertility, as well as other
problems, such as the use of such
measures indicating lack of trust
in a partner, meaning that their
use in long-term relationships
is limited. Men generally did not
want a microbicide to act simul-
taneously as a contraceptive, and
many indicated that they would
be angry if they discovered their
wives to be using microbicides
without permission. Interestingly,
many women also indicated that
covert use of such a product was
not welcomed, perhaps mostly
because of the risk of discovery.
Such studies indicate the difficulty
of the battle we face in order to
change attitudes towards women;
however, perhaps measures
such as microbicides, which give
women a degree of control in their
relationships, are a small step
towards this goal.

H
ow do you imagine the
future? Alex Proyas,
director of I, Robot, sees
a future of auto-piloted
cars, friendly robots,
and other high-tech, environmen-
tally clean gadgets. Ridley Scott,
director of Blade Runner, sees fly-
ing cars, androids, and pollution. So
which is it? Are we heading towards
an emissions-free, fossil fuel-free
economy, or will we maintain our
current emissions trends?
Most people have probably never
heard of BedZED – Beddington Zero
(Fossil) Emissions Development.
BedZED is the first and largest
UK eco-village. The mixed develop-
ment complex includes 100 homes
and additional office space. More
importantly, however, it claims to
be carbon neutral. In other words,
BedZED is not meant to contribute
to global warming through the emis-
sion of carbon dioxide and other
pollutants.
Recently, the Imperial College
branch of Engineers Without
Borders (EWB) visited BedZED and
had a look at how exactly this com-
munity functions.
Personally, I was very sceptical
about the project’s success. I expect-
ed to be let down either because
it would turn out to have ‘hidden’
emission sources or because I would
encounter uptight tree-hugging hip-
pies, running around and preaching
against other people’s dirty way of
life on the outside.
Here’s what I found out. They have
a highly effective recycling system,
treat all of their waste water and
reuse it (though they do bring in
new drinking water), use solar pan-
els and a Combined Heat and Power
(CHP) system run on woodchip
waste (which would otherwise have
been burnt or put into landfills), and
have no heating or air conditioning.
So here’s the flaw! How do these
people put up with the cold winter
months (and ‘hot’ summer days)?
Large double-glazed windows pro-
vide for a greenhouse type of heat-
ing effect and prevent heat loss.
The offices are built on the lower
levels, so that heat generated by
electronic equipment cycles up into
the living areas. This still leaves one
important qustion about air quality
unanswered.
How do you guarantee good qual-
ity fresh air if you don’t have forced
or natural ventilation? A highly cre-
ative ventilation system using a heat
exchanger based on simple aerody-
namic principles ensures that fresh
air enters while ‘contaminated’
air is expelled, and heat inside the
house is maintained without need
for energy input. (I know you are all
impressed, even if you are a big fan
of fossil fuels).
What’s not so positive about this
highly innovative community then?
Firstly, these ‘tree huggers’ are
guilty of driving your conventional
highly polluting internal combustion
petrol cars. Sure, they do have a car-
sharing system, which means they
don’t drive everywhere they go, but
the cars still use petrol!
Secondly, the insulation material
Giving women control in HIV prevention
used in the houses is highly damag-
ing to the environment. The people
at ZEDFactory tolds us that despite
the negative environmental impacts
of these materials, the overall result
was overwhelmingly positive.
In fact, these were the only two sig-
nificant disadvantages of BedZED.
Which means it does quite well from
an environmental perspective.
So where were all the crazy tree
huggers? Actually, the people living
there were rather down-to-earth.
My real problem was that despite
having been reassured that most of
them were friendly and highly inte-
grated in the community, the place
looked like a graveyard. It remind-
ed me of books like The Giver or
Fahrenheit 451, where society has
reached some kind of utopian life-
style through brain washing!
Maybe this is a touch too extreme
and while I was impressed by
BedZED, why weren’t simpler solu-
tions appropriate to larger commu-
nities implemented? If you face real-
ity, people require ‘luxuries’, such
as computers, heating and air con-
ditioning, cars, and so on. Why not
try to provide them with the same
but more efficient energy-conserv-
ing technologies, without being as
radical as BedZED.
As engineering and science stu-
dents, we found visiting BedZED
quite an interesting experience. One
day we’ll all have to realise that the
way we abuse of our scarce natural
resources will end up harming our
own children, if not us. BedZED
may seem ugly and unliveable, but it
is a considerable step forward.
