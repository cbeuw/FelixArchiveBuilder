T
hanks to the Times Movie
Mania, two lucky Felix
readers will win a pair of
tickets each to the spe-
cial screening of Jarhead.
What’s Jarhead you say? Well, don’t
be impatient, hear me out!
Directed by Oscar-winning direc-
tor, Oscar Mendes, Jarhead includes
a stellar cast of Jake Gyllenhaal,
Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard and
Chris Cooper.
In the summer of 1990, Anthony
Swofford, (Jake Gyllenhaal) a 20-
year-old third-generation enlis-
And then there are 3 Fantastic Four DVDs!
tee was sent to the deserts of Saudi
Arabia to fight in the first Gulf War.
In 2003, his memories of the time in
that place became the best-selling
book Jarhead. Swofford wrote with
the urgency, immediacy, honesty and
humour that could only come from
someone who had lived through the
experience itself. Jarhead is the
unvarnished story straight through
the eyes of the then 20-year-old kid,
who told of a very different war from
the one delivered in print or over
the air.
Jarhead offers a ground up per-
spective of the Gulf War, live with
shootings of burning oil wells and
night-skies lit by comet-like flames.
The recruits are rowdy, horny,
exhilarated and also terrified that at
any moment, over the next hill, the
war might begin. These young men,
are suddenly dropped down in an
unforgiving terrain, seeking diver-
sion in a game of gas mask football
while they await the arrival of care
packages containing letters and
porn. Strangely enough, out of this
hellish situation unlikely friendships
are formed. Jarhead is also a tale of
fierce loyalty and do-or-die camara-
derie. It’s a brotherhood of jarheads
sworn to be faithful always.
Now, how do you get your hands
on these 2 pairs of tickets? It’simple,

S
tarring Chris Evans
(Cellular),JessicaAlba(Sin
City, Into the Blue), Ioan
Grufford (Hornblower)
and Michael Chiklis (The
Shield), Fantastic Four is the tale
of four ordinary people who become
the most fantastic superheroes the
world has ever known.
Reed Richards (Grufford) is a
struggling yet brilliant scientist,
convinced he can find vital infor-
mation in space that will affect the
evolution of genetics. With the sup-
port of his friend and assistant Ben
Grimm (Chiklis), the two men must
approach their old school friend, and
now rival, Victor Von Doom (Julian
McMahon, Nip/Tuck) to finance the
project.
Reed learns that his ex-girlfriend
Sue Storm (Alba) is Doom’s new
love interest, and her rogue brother
Johnny (Evans) is one of his team.
With tensions in the group rising, the
four of them jet off into space with
Victor to conduct the experiment.
Unexpectedly, they are exposed to
a cosmic storm and, when the team
return to Earth, they discover they
have been transformed in a way
they could never have foreseen.
Strangely enough, the exposure
they suffered in the storm has fun-
damentally altered their DNA and
given them each an exciting super
power. Reed becomes extremely
stretchy, Sue gains the power of
invisibility and the power to create
force-fields. Johnny, the hot young
sizzling talent of the movie turns
into an explosive fireball or, if you
must, a human torch. Doom how-
ever, turns into the Fantastic Four’s
version of Magneto.
The group find themselves obliged
to use their powers to help oth-
ers and hence they decide to use
their talents for the greater good.
Their everyday appearances have
not changed as they can turn their
powers on and off… except for Ben
who has been affected the worst by
the blast. His entire bodily structure
has changed and he has turned into
solid stone… and he can’t change
back!
Christened ‘The Fantastic Four’,
Reed ‘Mr Fantastic’, Sue ‘The
Invisible Woman’, Johnny ‘The
Human Torch’ and Ben ‘The Thing’,
take on their new identities to fight
Victor who cannot accept the chang-
es in himself. His skeleton is turning
to steel and, increasingly angry at
his doomed fate, when ‘Dr Doom’
learns he can manipulate electricity
he sets out to destroy the Fantastic
Four and anyone else who gets in
his way.
Fantastic Four is available to buy
and rent on DVD, UMD and VHS
from Twentieth Century Fox Home
Entertainment on December 2nd
2005. Thanks to Twentieh-Century
Fox, Felix has three copies of the
DVD to give away.
Alrighty, now how do you get your
hands on this fabulous action-packed
movie filled with the delicious and
toned Jessica Alba? It’s easy. Just
answer the following question.
Q: Who is the singer behind the
sountrack ‘Everything Burns’ in
Fantastic Four?
Know the answer? Don’t be smug!

Free tickets from iCU cinema to
watch History of Violence and Four
Brothers!
Y
ou've obviously heard of
History of Violence and
if you haven't. shame on
you. It stars the likes of
Viggo Mortensen, who
has finally walked into the Hollywood
light after his stellar role in Lord Of
The Rings as the manly Aragorn, as
well as Maria Bello and Ed Harris.
What’s the story? It’s a story of a
simple man who runs a little cafe in a
small hick of a town. However, things
are about to change. Robbers invade
the peace and surprisingly enough,
Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) sud-
denly displays an exquisite skill in
killing people. Is he who he seems
to be? It’s a movie of ‘don’t believe
what you know’.
iCU cinema has three tickets to
giveaway for History of Violence.
Just answer the following question:
Where is Viggo Mortensen originally
from?
When their adopted mother
(Fionnula Flanagan) is killed in a
random grocery store robbery, her
four adopted sons(Mark Wahlberg,
Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and
Garrett Hedlund) return to avenge
her death. What was a simple rob-
bery soon reveals itself to be some-
thing more nefarious and sinister
involving one brother’s (Benjamin)
business dealings with a notorious
local hoodlum (Chiwetel Ejiofor).
Another 3 tickets to give away, just
tell me: Who sang Cleo’s Apartment
for the soundtrack of Four Brothers?
Write to me with your answer at
film.felix@ic.ac.uk with your name
and department. Good luck now!
