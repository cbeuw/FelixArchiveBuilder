selves.
Choosing a main course was dif-
ficult and with a variety of dishes
ranging from Vietnamese Nam
Yang Manao to Indonesian Nasi
Goreng there is something to acco-
modate for most tastes. Beware of
the spicy ratings though- the divine
Nam Yang Manao which came with
a spicy warning was surprisingly
refreshing, whilst the supposedly
mild Pho Xao Bo had a fierce kick.
Washed down with a mango smooth-
ie, though, it was nothing I couldn’t
handle.
The time flew by and before long
well over an hour had flown by. Too
stuffed to eat anything filling for
dessert, we ordered a mango sorbet
which was saturated with the fla-
vour of fresh fruit. It was the perfect
end to a thoroughly enjoyable meal.
Instead of being awash with gim-
micks, painstaking effort has gone
into creating a diverse menu and
a warm atmosphere. The staff are
attentive and you can see the cooks
flicking their woks from your seat.
Visiting Tampopo is like embarking
on an Oriental Odyssey for your
taste buds. The downside is simply
having to choose what to eat.

2 pork chops, diced
1/4 onion, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
a few mushrooms, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and pepper
1 tsp fresh minced ginger root
(optional)
1 tablespoon sesame or veg oil
1 sachet stir fry sauce
1. Heat a wok over a medium
heat, then coat with the oil. Saute
the onion, garlic, and ginger until
fragrant. Increase heat to high.
2. Place pork into wok. Cook and
stir until pork is no longer pink, about
4 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, green
pepper, and sliced green onion. Cook,
stirring, until vegetables are tender,
which will take about 4 minutes.
Stir in your chosen sauce and heat
through. Serve with noodles or rice.
Cheat’s Stir fry
Adding the soup to this stir fry gives
it a rich, creamy sauce which is ideal
teamed with rice or noodles.
S
tir-fries can be a gastro-
nomic event. Alternatively
they can also be the per-
fect emergency meal; low
in fat, high in fibre and real
fast food, it can’t really be beaten.
You just need to gather some veg,
noodles and a jar or sachet of sauce,
add meat if you’re feeling super
peckish and you have a meal fit for
a king.
Simple stir fry
Let’s face it- we’re never going to
be as adept as the Malaysians who
appear in the kitchen every meal
time at whipping up the perfect stir -
fry sauce. Many supermarkets have
both fresh and jar versions now.

The stir fry can see you through any cold winter night, whether cooked at home or away.

Fulham: full of eastern promise
Rule No. 1: Don’t drink BACARDI
but Havana Club! This isn’t
just because Bacardi is a big
American company and Havana
Club is still original Cuban, but it
is simply better. And you don’t pay
that much more. Most will agree
that for £1 extra it’s worth buying
a better spirit. Here’s a few drinks
you can prepare with white Rum.
- Pina Colada:
Sounds difficult yet is pretty easy
as long as you can get your hands
on cream of coconut. I found it
at Gerry’s Sprits Shop in Soho
(where you can probably find every
drink you could need for Cocktails).
- 1cl Cream
- 2cl Cream of Coconut (heat the
can up in hot water before use)
- 3cl white rum
- 4cl pineapple juice
Put all the ingredients together
with 2-3 ice cubes in a blender and
blend it. If you don’t have a blender
just shake it with a Shaker.
- Cuba Libre
A drink which our revolutionary
parents drank during the cold war
to show how “cool” they were and
also to get drunk.
- 4cl white rum
- 1cl fresh Lime juice
- Put into a glass with a few ice
cubes
- fill up with Coke
- Daiquiri
Never heard of it? It’s the easiest
rum-based cocktail and simply
fabulous.
- 5cl white rum
- 3cl lemon juice (best is to squeeze
them yourself, I’ve never found a
nice bottled one here in the UK)
- 2cl sugar syrup (which you can
buy in most wine shops or make
yourself)
Shake with 2-3 ice cubes and pour
into a cocktail-cup (martini glass).
Variation: Pink Daiquiri (exchange
1cl of sugar sirop with grenadine-in
wine shops too)
Make your own sugar syrup by dis-
solving a few tablespoons of sugar
in 1 tablespoon of water over a gen-
tle heat.
Hope you like them. Drink in
moderation!

2 chicken breasts, cut into bite
sized pieces
1/4 onion, chopped
1 green pepper
2 knobs of butter
salt and pepper
1 tsp paprika (optional)
1/2 can cream of mushroom soup
water to thin
1. Melt butter/margarine in a
medium wok over a low heat. Add
the chicken, onion and green pepper
and saute all over a low heat for 4 to
6 minutes, stirring occasionally and
turning the chicken pieces. Season
with paprika, some crushed garlic,
salt and pepper.
2. Cover the wok and let it all cook
until the chicken is done and juices
run clear, which will take about
15 minutes. When the chicken is
cooked through add the soup and
water and let it simmer, stirring
frequently. When liquid has reached
the consistency of a sauce, the dish
is done. Serve with rice or noodles.
After an exhausting day trun-
dling back and forth between
HammersmithandSouthKensington
there’s nothing more appealing
than having dinner cooked for you.
Especially when it’s being cooked
to perfection at Tampopo, Britain’s
favourite restaurants when it come
to authentic Pan Asian cuisine..
The restaurant is illuminated by
an orange glow, courtesy of low-
hanging lanterns and, although side
by side with other tables, it has a
very intimate feel. I would recom-
mend it for both a first date situation
or even a party; the staff are very
accommodating in any situation.
For starters we tried the Vegetable
Tempura which was dreamily light
and melted in the mouth and Gyoza
(Pork dumplings). Both came with
sweet dipping sauces which were
as appealing as the morsels them-
at Gerry’s Sprits Shop in Soho
Melt-in-the-mouth Vegetable
Tempura
Pork Gyoza Dumplings
Jasmine rice is a perfect accom-
paniment for any of the curries.
Is there a meal you des-
perately want to know how
to make? Or an obscure
liquor you would like our
Mixologist to blend into
a sumptuous cocktail?
