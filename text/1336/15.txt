Madonna? Oh yes it is.
No more body parts I’m afraid these are too good
Am I the Editor?
I take it some of you were a little
offended by what my Bar Wench
wrote last week. What I have to say
is, if you don’t like it, don’t read it.
Firstly my Bar Wench writes as
shes it. She saw a load of irritat-
ing yanks so she wrote about it. I
thought it was very informative.
The two letters I have received
have been very interesting. Now the
reviews. The bar wench has written
another fantasticly fabulous piece
for us. Not quite sure what it was
about as I was drunk when I put this
together. Did I put in the picture of
someone using the complaint as
toilet paper? I guess I should just
get fired now.
In addition to this I thought I
should have something about the
lady of the hour: Madonna at G-A-Y.
Also have something from my night
at Renaissance.
The Nightlife Editor
The lady of the hour
Well, I was told by a friend of mine
that I should apologise for my
cruel generalisation and degrada-
tion of the American visitors to our
beloved Union. At first I consid-
ered their compassionate idea, but
then I thought: ‘Hell no! Especially
when they stroll in at 5 to 11 and
ask for pitchers of Guinness. The
moronic, stupid, loud gits shouldn’t
be allowed! Bloody cheek!’
Anyways, as my manic, midget
obsessed editor says, no point flog-
ging a dead coke whore. This week
is binge drinking. Now, guys, I think
you all must have heard about, even
seen in our very own Union this
awful trend in society today, this evil
corrupting minds, bodies and souls.
Whatabsolutebollocks!I’msorrybut
who has ever thought: “Oh no, that’s
my third pint of Carlsberg, better
stop or else I’ll be binge drinking”?
What I don’t understand is when
did four pints suddenly change from
being a normal amount of drinks to
an obscene number of units that will
end up in numerous cancers and
liver failure? To be honest, if that’s
the case, I’m guaranteed a dose of
mouth cancer and sclerosis of the
liver before I’m 25. Oh well, we’ve all
got to die of something.
Will it deter us from drinking our-
selves into comas? Somehow I don’t
think so. It would be like giving an
obese person an unlimited supply of
cake. Five hours later and you know
the puke bin will have to be reached
for so they can start all over again. I
know it’s so that people don’t cram
fourty units into half an hour but
come on Tony, show me an intoxi-
cated person who thinks: “Hmm I’ve
got four hours left, therefore I will
only drink beverages of one unit and
alternate it with water”. Not bloody
likely.
We are students, drinking our-
selves stupid is part of the lifestyle.
Oh no, is this a piece of journalism
I see before me? I bloody hope not!
Where’s my bottle of vodka?
The Bar Wench Just a little bit gay
Alright, I’ll get the boring stuff over
with first. Renaissance at The Cross
costs about £20, but this can change
depending if the guy at the till likes
you or thinks you’re hot. But really,
I would say its worth going out once
a week to somewhere really good
instead of going out 4 times a week
to all those skanky holes we all love.
I mean don’t get me wrong, I love
the smell of vomit and piss when I
walk into a place. That’s why we all
love Prospect. Well if you’ve start-
ed drinking homemade snakebite
before going out at 11pm then you
know you are in for a dirty night.
After a hot drunken Tube ride to
King’s Cross, my friend Trish and
me had to make our way through
what can only be described as the
ultimate in rape alleys.
We managed to avoid rape, mur-
der, or worse still, having someone
start to approach you, about to mug
you, and then realising you’re not
worth it and clearing off (I mean
I don’t look too much like a tramp
do I).
Getting in was no problem but we
did get accosted by several people
in big hats screaming in some funny
language. I think they were probably
northern or something, or perhaps
Australian.
When we arrived the place was
already rammed. People were
sweating like a paedophile in moth-
er care or like the really obese man
on the bus on the way home. If you
take up two seats you should pay
twice as much!
The music initially was very beige
and bland. It may not sound bad but
could you imagine your friends call-
ing you beige or magnolia? It would
be enough to make you slit your
wrists and sit in a warm bath. I know
some people should, but still. After
venturing around the various sweat
pits we ended up outside dancing
in the rain. If any of you have been
to The Cross you will know its an
amazing venue. Not very big but its
really individual; lots of palm trees.
Sorry another slight tangent
there. The range of music was quite
incredible, I was truly surprised.
Quite often when you go to a club
they tend to stick to one genre of
music: be it hard, funky or dirty
house. It was refreshing to be able
to go from room to room and actu-
ally feel something different.

“I don’t look too
much like a tramp do
I?”
For those of you who didn’t realise,
perhaps you’ve been living in a cave
or haven’t had your head out of a
textbook in a while, Madonna is back
– with a vengeance. Her new album
is a glittering fusion of retro funk
and future disco and, let’s face it, it’s
just a little bit gay.
It’s no surprise then that just four
days after her spectacular album
launch at Koko she put on a very
special show for the little dancing
queens of London at the countries
most brand labelled gay club, G-A-Y.
Hosted at the Astoria Theatre on
Charing Cross Road, G-A-Y has a
live act nearly every Saturday of
the year, ranging from the legen-
dary Britney Spears herself (woo
hoo) to, ahem, Daphne and Celeste
(bless, they did try). The great thing
about seeing an act at G-A-Y is that
the rest of the night is one super-
fun-happy party with super-cheap
drinks. Without a doubt this show
was by far the best live performance
ever held at G-A-Y.
After weeks of teasing snippets of
information, mysterious disco ball
posters that never once used the
word ‘Madonna’ and hours of queu-
ing for tickets on a cold, cold morn-
ing in Soho, the lucky two thousand
that made it in were going for it like
Duracell Bunnies - pink, fluffy and
absolutely hyper. I’d like to say I
feel I truly suffered for my ticket as
in my excitement at the prospect of
standing around on the street for
two hours I spilled hot coffee down
myself and ruined a perfectly good
scarf in the process. By the age of
twenty you’d think I could use a
sippy cup, but no.
The songs were taken almost
exclusively from her new album,
opening with ‘Hung Up’ before par-
tying through ‘Let It Will Be’, ‘Get
Together’, ‘I Love New York’ and
finishing with a remixed classic in
the form of ‘Everybody’.
Fortunately for die hard old-school
Madonna fans, the DJ sets for the
night were very Madge heavy with
at least a solid hour of her best
known hits either side of the Queen
of Pop herself – including my per-
sonal favourite part of the night,
when, where you would expect an
encore, the anthemic ‘Like a Prayer’
began to play and the crowd went
nuts with wails of “Oh My GOD! I
can’t BELIEVE she’s gonna sing
THIS!” They kept going nuts until
half way through the song when they
finally realised it was just a DJ track
and Madonna had long since left the
building. Bless ‘em. She didn’t even
say goodbye, which was the perfect
end to the set. Harsh but effective
and the most memorable ending for
the most memorable night the club
has ever hosted.

Look at her go! Boy she can move that ass
“Unlimited supply of
cake”
“Manic, midget
obsessed”
