When asked what the “Blue Man
Group” was all about by a friend
before watching the show, I was
at a loss for a suitable description.
“Performance artists pretending to
do things for the first time” was
what I eventually settled for. Now
after “experiencing” the Blue Men,
my prior description does seem
pathetically inadequate.
For the clueless, there are some
distinct features of the Blue Man
Group that really outstand them
from any other ordinary perform-
er. The most upfront, being their
uncomfortably bald blueness. They
have an otherworldly appearance
that could scare a timid child into
tears. There is a strange “naked-
ness” about the group that makes

them vulnerable and child-like.
Their faces are frozen straight but
by no means blank.
The uniformity of their appear-
ance meant that there are no “frills”
to distract the audience. They wear
black suits with funky contraptions
that spew out food/paint in the
course of the show. Most impor-
tantly, they do not speak and their
“act” has no storyline.
Although these enigmatic charac-
ters hardly emitted any squeaks, the
energy from their eyes and other
body movements gave them away
entirely. They communicated with
the audience in a way that surpass-
es performers who actually speak.
The act saw the Blue Men playing
with ordinary objects and testing
how far one could get doing so. Sort
of like a dare, with no boundaries.
Most of it accompanied by great
rhythmic music that got my friend
and I bobbing our heads and tapping
our feet. The music made uncannily
by the crunch of Rice Krispies, a
colourful PVC-pipe-xylophone and
oil drums. Members of the audience
who were picked by the Blue Men
to participate in their on-stage rou-
tines, were gems themselves:
20 minutes into the show, eve-
rything was suddenly stopped as
a man holding a camcorder gets
upstage to film the arrival of some
latecomers. Accompanied by an
opera singer’s rendition of “You’re
Late” and strong white spotlights
with much flare, this, I believe will
put the embarrassed couple off
being late for a while.
A stern-looking man was pulled
down from the balcony to be painted
blue. He was then smashed against
a white wall to form his print. He
looked miffed but much to the
amusement of the audience!
I regret describing the Blue Man
Group as “performance art”. It
does deserve less of a classification.
Being in the audience was more of
an experience. A reminder, if you
like, of how we should not forget how
to play and connect with others, and
experience the joy of being alive.

The little Blue Men are coming to
get you....
Night has fallen over South
Kensington. A crash is heard in
the distance as someone stumbles
blindly. A figure walks slowly with
a chair in his arms, trying to avoid
obstacles as he crosses the room.
Whispers of voices hide in the chat-
ter of others. Even stranger, this
is all going on in a room at the
top of the Union, where the cast
are rehearsing for the upcoming
play, Peter Schaffer’s Black Comedy
(directed by Brooke Milburn), which
will open on the 30th of November as
half of a double bill with Joe Orton’s
Ruffian on the Stair (directed by
Neil Monteiro).
The first play, Black Comedy, is
about an sculptor facing a high-
ly nerve-wracking evening with
a potential buyer and his future
father-in- law. Typically for such an
important occasion, his power goes
out before his guests even arrive,
and the rest of the evening just goes
downhill from there.
After the interval, the audience
returns to find a magic wand has
been waved over the stage, and we
are sent to the other side of theatre
for Ruffian on the Stair, a dark drama
about a hit man and his live-in girl-
friend, who is blissfully unaware of
his occupation. One day, a strange
man shows up on their doorstep
while the boyfriend is meeting a man
in the King’s Cross toilets. Though
he seems to be merely harassing
the woman, we gradually learn that
there is more to the story. A strong
cast of three carry this intense piece
through its twists and turns to an
explosive end.

It is worth seeing this play sim-
ply to experience the Orange Tree
Theatre, a small venue in Richmond.
The ‘stage’ is a square of floor sur-
rounded by seats on all sides and
there is also a balcony where peo-
ple can sit and enjoy a bird’s eye
view. It is a very intimate space and
must be challenging for the actors,
who are only metres away from the
audience, as this allows every facial
expression and movement to be
scrutinised.
However, all five characters are
played superbly by actors who are
recognisable from television roles
including parts in Black Books,
Spooks, Dr Who, Casualty and Silent
Witness. The proximity to the drama
makes it more interesting to watch
as you can see spit fly, veins bulge
and detail that you would miss in
most other theatres.
The plot is about Donald Jackson,
a scientist working on a space-
based missile system for America’s
defence programme. However, he
loses support for his research and
transfers his work to an enemy state
referred to in discussions only by
coded initials. He is murdered and
his son Paul, a young university
professor, attempts to understand
the truth behind his father’s death
by contacting CIA bureaucrat John
Doyle.
Between them, Paul and Doyle tell
Although there are hardly any
props or special effects, the scenes
that unfold are still dramatic and
the story is well told. There are
parts of the play that flash back to
previous events with conflicting ver-
sions of the truth being revealed.
This switch between the past and
present is carried out very smoothly
and the plot is easy to follow.
The way the stage is set up with
the audience surrounding it is an
original idea and it is fun to be
able to watch how everybody else
is reacting to the play. It was also
interesting sitting next to a group
of Americans on the way home who
had also just seen it. According to
them it was ‘preachy’ and ‘too politi-
cal.’ I disagree, but go and see for
yourself.

each other (and us) what they know,
or at least what they are willing to
tell, about the events leading up to
Jackson’s assassination.
The playwright Jason Sherman
was inspired by the real life murder
of the Canadian weapons scientist
Gerald Bull, a man who felt betrayed
by his own and the American govern-
ment when his work was no longer
given support. As a result, he start-
ed to conduct international arms
deals with countries that led the US
government to become increasingly
worried. He was warned to stop his
involvement several times, but was
eventually assassinated, shot three
times in the back, twice in the head.
No one has ever been arrested for
his murder. All this is relevant in the
present climate. Words that spring
to mind are Iraq, WMD, scapegoat
and distortion of truth.
Theatre
Coram Boy
The National Theatre
Until 4 February 2006
Tickets £10-36
Student Standby £10
The National certainly doesn’t seem
to be going for ease in its Christmas
family entertainment. Last year
it was the phenomenal His Dark
Materials and this year it is Jamila
Gavin’s Whitbread Award winning
novel Coram Boy. I was a little
apprehensive as to what the result
would be; adaptations of children’s
books can so often be sentimen-
talised. I really didn’t need to have
worried.
Helen Edmundson’s masterly
adaptation is very faithful to Jamila
Gavin’s novel and is not at all pre-
cious about the grittier aspects
which give it so much of gothic
beauty.
The story itself spans two gen-
erations and eight years and like the
book, has music as a central theme,
particularly Handel’s Messiah which
is played and sung with beautiful
effect and style by the actors and a
live choir and orchestra at the back
of the stage.
Paul Ritter is deliciously slimy as
the utterly immoral villain of the
piece, Otis Gardiner, a man who, in
cahoots with Ruth Gemmell’s coldly
calculating Mrs Lynch, makes his
living by collecting babies from des-
perate mothers who also give him
money in the belief that he will take
them to be cared for at the Coram
Hospital in London, but instead bur-
ies them and pockets the money.
Jack Tarlton is no less mesmerising
as the son that Otis abuses, not quite
of this world, losing and discovering
love and life with such poignancy
that the stage feels almost lacking
when he is not there.
Another brilliant innovation in this
production is having the many boys
played by actresses; an approach
that is so effective and utterly believ-
able. Anna Madeley’s performance
as two boys, Alexander Ashbrook
and his son Aaron, is sublime. She
also had the most startlingly perfect
voice that I have ever heard – quite
an astonishing thing in a woman
who also has to scamper around
stage, laugh and cry and then sing
extremely exposed and challenging
baroque arias.
Of course, it wasn’t perfect – for
people who don’t know the story
already it may be a little confusing at
times, I felt that Mrs Lynch’s moral-
ity lecture was slightly unnecessary
and the Hallelujah Chorus was a lit-
tle corny, but these are niggles and
highly debateable ones at that.
It was, very simply, one of the very
best experiences that I’ve ever had
in the theatre. So if you’re planning
a family outing, an evening with a
significant other – or have no excuse
at all, apart from wanting one of the
most haunting and moving experi-
ences in the theatre that you are
ever likely to have – you could do a
lot, lot worse than going to see this.
