The fall of
Southside...
...the rise of Linstead
After weeks of delays, the Union
have finally announced some of the
results of Union Council elections.
Some results were delayed after
numerous complaints were filed
regarding the conduct of some can-
didates. Five candidates were dis-
qualified for illegal campaigning via
mass spam e-mailing of students.
Emma Persky was elected as the
Equal Opportunities Officer, defeat-
ing her only opponent, Kareem
Osman. Dan Lehmann and Christine
Itegbe were elected into the Trading
and Retail Committee, with Dan
elected again into the Services
Committee. Laura Parkinson, Alon
Or-Bach and Laura Griffiths were
elected as Imperial’s ULU delegates.
However, a number of elections are
still under dispute, and have yet
to announce any results; namely
those for the Ordinary Members of
Council, for which positions a record
number of candidates stood.
On being elected as the Equal
Opportunities Officer, Ms Persky
was glad. She told Felix, “Equal
opportunities is an area I feel partic-
ularly passionate about”. The new
officer announced that she would be
concentrating on ‘Woman’s issues’,
saying, “I would like to see the
university putting more effort into
encouraging young women into sci-
ence and engineering”.
The delays in the annouce-
ment of the Union Council results
stemmed from complaints regard-
ing two mass e-mails sent to club
mailing lists, where the recipients
did not know who the sender was.
The Union immediately started an
investigation, which was hindered
by several factors including the fact
that sent e-mails were blind copied
(so it could not be seen who the
e-mails were sent to), the sent e-
mails were deleted from senders’
mail accounts, and the fact that the
mailing list was split into 15 subsets,
with each e-mail sent to a different
part of the list. “It was only through
the help of ICT and other electronic
infromation that we were able to Leader, page 19

piece together what happened,”
said Sameena Misbahuddin, ICU
President.
Although the disqualified candi-
dates did not send the offending
e-mails, The Union Exceutive were
unanimous in their decision that a
serious breach of regulations had
occurred with a deliberate attempt
to hide the evidence. The Union
believe the senders were instructed
to send e-mails by the candidates,
or the candidates were aware of
the senders campaigning for them.
The disqualified candidates claimed
that they were not aware that any
rules had been breached, despite
being given a ‘candidate pack’, that
stated the rules regarding emails
very clearly, at the beginning of the
election.
“The hold up has been frustrating
for all involved”, Ms Misbahuddin
told Felix, she issued a warning to
future candidates, “This shows that
the breaking of rules will not be
tolerated; elections must be run and
fought fairly, and any attempt to
breach the rules will be found out”.
Obviously, some of those disquali-
fied were not happy with the result.
Felix spoke to Tanvirul Alam and
Haji Hassam, who denied any wrong-
doing. “The reason it appeared that
a mailing list was used is because
our friends were e-mailed, and
being our friends we naturally have
the same interests, which is why the
recipients were on the mailing list”
said Mr Hassam. When asked why
the recipients were blind carbon
copied, Hassam said that this was
because it was sent to his friends,
but if a particular person decided
to send a reply to the whole group,
then this would prevent people who
didn’t know the replier from receiv-
ing an e-mail. He also claimed that
the e-mails were not saved becuase
“they were sent from website e-
mail addresses, such as Yahoo or
Hotmail, which doesn’t automati-
cally save sent items”. Unfortunatly
he didn’t specify if these were per-
sonal adresses, or why he didn’t
use Imperial’s own e-mail system in
this case. Hassam and Alam were
adament that they tried to keep to
the rules, with both claiming they
did not send out e-mails to their
respective societies (Alam is head
of MathSoc; Hassam president of IC
Finance) advertising the elections
as they knew that such an act would
deliberatly swing votes their way.
Tanvirul appeared defensive, say-
ing that “My friends who did this
were not on my campaign team …
I had no responsibility for what they
did”. Both Hassam and Alam were
also critical of the investigation,
with Alam claiming that the Union
Executive had already “made up

As the demolition of the much loved Southside building
continues (top) a new bar opens in Linstead. The Harrington
Bar & Grill which “is not a Southside replacement” opens at
12pm today. But, Roger Pownall, Bar Manager, wasn’t too keen
on Felix publicising the opening: “We don’t want everyone to
come here until we know we can handle it.”
