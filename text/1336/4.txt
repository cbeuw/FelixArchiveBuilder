O
n 10 October 2001 Diane
Pretty went to the High
Court in a plea for the
right to terminate her
life. She was paralysed
from the neck down, doubly incon-
tinent, and in need of constant care.
Despite overwhelming public sup-
port, Pretty’s request was denied,
as was her later appeal to the House
of Lords: the UK was not ready to
legalise assisted suicide. Having lost
a two-year legal battle, she was left
to die in the way she least wanted:
distressed and in pain.
Today, the march towards legali-
sation has progressed considerably
since the Pretty case. Last July,
the British Medical Association
dropped its long-held opposition to
assisted dying in favour of a neutral
stance. Proposals to allow doctors
to help terminally ill people die were
reintroduced in the House of Lords
this month and await discussion.
The Assisted Dying for the
Terminally Bill was also the subject
of a debate last week at a slightly
more academic venue – Imperial
College. The event was organised
by the Christian Medical Fellowship
and the Imperial College Christian
Union. Two guest speakers tack-
led the arguments for and against
euthanasia.
“In my own clinical and personal
life I’ve watched many people die,
and I can think of several occasions
where I was strongly tempted to
give lethal medication just to end it
all. But I always held back from that
final step, not least because there
is a clear prohibition of the law on
intentional killing, but also I have a
profound conviction that deliberate
killing is wrong. What is actually
being proposed is a major change
in the law on intentional killing and
on suicide. Let’s not try to sani-
tise the reality with compassionate
words,” said Prof Wyatt, a professor
of neonatal paediatrics at University
College London and an expert on
Christian medical ethics.
“We recognize that life is a gift. It
may come from a Christian under-
standing that life is special, but most
people, even if they don’t have a
religious faith, understand that life
is special and recognise that we
are a community, we belong to one
another, and therefore what you do
affects me and vice versa. Assisting
suicide strikes at the heart of this
understanding. It seems to me that
suicide is not a right to be assisted,
it is a tragic sign of despair to be
prevented.”
Currently, assisted dying is legal
in few places in the world. In the
Netherlands, 1 in 40 deaths are
due to assisted suicide or volun-
tary euthanasia. In the US, assisted
suicide is only permitted by law in
the state of Oregon, albeit under
a very strict set of a priori condi-
tions from the patient. Since 1997,
208 patients, most of them suffering
from cancer, made use of the right to
an assisted suicide. The US govern-
Regarding the pain of others
ment is currently seeking to over-
turn the Oregon law in the Supreme
Court. However, if the law is found
to be constitutional, many federal
states are hoping to follow Oregon’s
example.
Of all countries, Switzerland is by
far the most liberal with respect to
assisted suicide, allowing it even
when performed by non-physicians,
the only safeguard being that no
selfish reasons are involved. It also
allows foreign citizens to be assisted
to commit suicide on Swiss territory,
a situation which has been commer-
cialised to an extent by Dignitas, an
organisation which provides assist-
ance in suicide in exchange for a
small fee. Reportedly, 20 Britons
have already used its services.
“I have the greatest respect
for palliative care, it does great
things for so many people. But
there are some patients whom
we are unable to help,” said Dr
Margaret Brainthwaithe, a barris-
ter and former consultant physi-
cian and anaesthetist at the Royal
Brompton Hospital and a member
of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society.
“Some of them feel so strongly that
they starve and dehydrate them-
selves to death. Alternatively, they
can persuade their friends, their

relatives or possibly their medical
practitioners to act covertly and help
them to die in some discreet manner,
hoping this will not come to the light
of the authorities, so that there will
be no persecution, but recognizing
that that risk exists, and when they
die, they will not know if they near-
est and dearest will subsequently be
charged. Finally, their other option
is to take themselves off overseas
and visit a commercial organisation
available in Switzerland where it is
possible to purchase assistance in
dying. We like to think of ourselves
as a caring, affectionate, tolerant,
maybe even loving society, but what
an indictment on a soci-
ety with those values
when our most troubled
citizens have to go over-
seas to seek the relief we
cannot afford them.”
Can a religious per-
spective bring a valid
perspective to the debate
on an increasingly secu-
lar society? “My biggest
fear is for tolerance. I
can respect the view of
the Christian faith, but
they shouldn’t impose
their views on me any-
more than I am imposing
my views on them. And that is the
message that needs to go right up
the Christian hierarchy and not just
the Christian Medical Fellowship. I
think fanaticism, in any religion, is
counter productive to the benefit of
society.”
CERN, the European Organisation
for Nuclear Research, is the
world’s largest particle physics
centre where scientists explore
what matter is made of and what
the forces that hold it together
are. Thursday 1 December will
be a celebration of CERN’s 50th
birthday, the 100th anniversary
of Einstein’s publication of the
Special Theory of Relativity, and
the World Year of Physics. CERN
will celebrate by hosting a 12-hour
webcast about Einstein and the
future of physics beyond Einstein.
So how is Imperial College relat-
ed to this? Well, CERN is working
in collaboration with Imperial and
19 other UK universities in the
construction of GridPP
, the UK
Grid for Particle Physics. The Grid
is a network of computers running
together, designed to analyse the
immense amount of data acquired
from the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC). If you are a non-physicist
(or have not read Dan Brown’s
Angels and Demons), the LHC will
smash particles travelling at near-
light speeds in a 27-kilometre-long
circular tunnel underneath the
Swiss and French Alps. Scheduled
for completion by 2007, its aim is
to recreate the conditions of the
early universe, a fraction of a sec-
ond after the Big Bang.
From the Internet to the Grid
and Neutrinos, Imperial College
will present a history of revolu-
tionary, world-changing commu-
nication technologies invented
as a result of scientific research.
Hosted by Gareth Mitchell from
4.30pm to 6pm, there will be key
appearances by the pioneers of the
Internet, Vint Cerf, Peter Kirstein,
and Robert Cailliau. There will
also be live connections to the
IceCube experiment, a one-cubic-
kilometre high-energy neutrino
observatory at the South Pole.
Before CERN hands transmis-
sion over to Imperial College,
physics Nobel laureates Murray
Gell-Mann, David Gross, Gerard
t’Hooft, and Stephen Hawking will
answer questions live from the
Solvay conference in Brussels.
Other partner institutions host-
ing different programmes
throughout the 12-hour webcast
include the National Science
Education Center in Taipei,
the Exploratorioum in San
Francisco, Fermilab in Chicago,
the Bloomfield Science Museum
in Jerusalem, and the Telecom
Future Lab in Venice.
Follow the webcast live from your
computer, for a unique chance to
interact with Nobel laureates on
live Q&A from 11.00 to 23.00 GMT
on 1 December.
