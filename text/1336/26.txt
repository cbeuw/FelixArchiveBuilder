Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace
HHHHH
A
hh… Felix, Felix, Felix!
I had a pet called Felix
once. He was black and
white, and had four legs.
He ran away when we
went to the zoo. I thought that was
the last I would see of my Felix. But
no, Richard Attenborough insists on
reminding me lions feasted on his
carcass.
Last Thursday, the new series of
Little Britain aired. I’m a bigger fan
of this show than Marjorie Dawes is
of insulting Asians, so my expecta-
tions were higher placed than the
Qu’ran. So too were the nation’s
and the BBC’s. Little Britain began
on BBC3, then gained promotion to
BBC2 and now Series 3 has gone
straight to air on BBC1. It is a tes-
tament to the show’s success that
it is now regarded as a primetime
program, but some argue it will
become too mainstream. Only a few
months ago, the excellent Extras
was scheduled for BBC1, but crea-
tor Ricky Gervais demanded it be
shown on BBC2 to avoid becoming
too mainstream. I understand the
argument, but it is about as appar-
ent as Daffyd’s sexual orientation!
Unless it is clear television execs
insisted the program be toned down
for popular channels, surely the pro-
gram is crap because of its creators’
faults?

You are forgiven for thinking that
this article might be dealing with the
seedy underworld of entertainment
piracy. It is not about some shady
bloke called Garth, who flogs dodgy
DVDs from the boot of his Ford
Sierra in some dingy alley. In fact, I
am preaching to you and demanding
the attention of the Channel 4 execs.
This show is genius. It is criminal
that it has not been released on
DVD.
Matthew Holness, who starred
briefly in The Office, plays Garth
Marenghi. Marenghi is a prolific
horror writer, no, dream-weaver. His
cannon of famous chillers includes:
‘Slicer’, ‘Juggers’ and ‘Afterbirth’,
the last of which tells of a mutated
placenta that attacks Bristol. During
the 1980s, Marenghi wrote, directed
and starred in a program so “radi-
cal, dangerous and God-damned
crazy” the television corporations
denied showing it. Now, these com-
panies have come back to Marenghi
and asked him to unleash the horror
on the unsuspecting public – that’s
you and I. This creation is the “most
significant televisual event since
Quantum Leap”: Darkplace.
Darkplace is a hospital drama
with a twist: supernatural occur-
rences are the norm around these
wards. Marenghi plays Rick Dagless
MD, ‘Dag’ to his friends. One of his
good buddies is Sanchez, although
these cats occasionally do have
punch-ups. Liz is the new girl on
the block, complete with telekinetic
powers. Each of them sports a clas-
sic 80s mullet, including Liz with
what can only be described as the
female equivalent. Their boss is the
legendary Thornton Reed, donning
bushy afro. Together, this unstoppa-
ble team overcomes any difficulties
that the underworld throws at them.
The doctors deal with an evil high-
land force known as “Scotch Mist”,
possessed kitchen utensils and

Last weeks Little Britain was cer-
tainly not toned down. In a super-
market, David Walliams played OAP
Mrs Emery. We expect something
fishy to happen. She starts natter-
ing to a friend: “Blah, blah, bl…”
Urea-ka! The flood gates opened!
Walliams is wetter than a [edited
- I crossed the line.] as she starts
gushing piss onto the floor! Cringe-
worthy: I smiled through my fin-
gers covering my eyes. Smiled, not
laughed.
We saw the return of Bubbles,
darling. First, a predictable joke:
“Are you sticking to your diet Mrs
DeVere?” asks someone. “I’m just
having Special K this morning”
replies Bubbles carrying a stacked
tray of cereal boxes. Second: two
men rolling around in fat suits. It
just didn’t cut the mustard. Last
series, Bubbles was shockingly
funny. This was more like Takeshi’s
Castle on Bravo!
Few new characters meant the old
guard needed to save the show. Matt
Lucas must have had a back, sack
and crack. Shamelessly, dressed in
an outrageous thong, Daffyd had
“become a rent-boy Myfanwy”. Good
sketch, but no classic. Andy or Lou,
I forget which one. It’s like Ant and
Dec, Dick and Dom; guessing who’s
who. The ‘cripple’ then, went swim-
ming with sharks and parachuting:
more smiles. The best was probably
from “V to the P
, icky to the ollard”
who had a dance off, Run DMC style.
Her break dancing was phat. Not
only “p-h” but pretty “f” fat too as
her home girls spun her round as
convincingly as a beached whale.
Overall, it was enjoyable. Much bet-
ter than the half-arsed slapstick of
The Worst Week of My Life that
followed, but rarely belly-aching.
Quick mention about Lost:
Sawyer’s turn. A better episode as
always when focussed on him, but
we still got nowhere with the main
plot. Oh well. Lastly, I also caught
a bit of Children In Need which is
great fun if you like watching kids
dying and celebrities’ careers dying
too.

R
eal shocker this week.
Firstly, I barged into
Lynnie’s something
past midnight like a root
rat on heat. Being a bit
worse of the turps I crashed out
on her sofa and smooched the dog
come morning. Bit awkward, as you
might imagine, after that. Funnily
enough, that Janelle patched us up
proper. Closer than two bills in the
wet season now; and her kissing is
100% on Harvey’s.
The poor gal is worried about
me, now that I got some graft with
Paul “The Slime” Robinson. But,
nah! A bloke like me knows when
he’s being conned, plus I’m in need
of the bees and honey. You see, I
gotta start paying my way now Old
Davie boy ain’t gunna be too happy
since his daughter is having the
naughty with some pommie bikini
shop owner from over the road, and
Hazzer’s been giving us grief since
I got back from the bush. Bunch of
wowsers I say!
Talking of wowsers, Dylan got
done up and down proper in the cof-
fee shop by some school boy. I told
the kid to get off the grass and give
the drongo a dinky-di seeing too,
cos I ain’t having my Sky courting
a pansy.
Anyway, hooroo for now!

Last weeks TV DVD Crime
in another episode Dag becomes
attached to a randy mutant eye.
The action takes place on
retro, cheap, poorly lit sets; think
Diagnosis Murder piss-take.
Upbeat electronic music accom-
panies the actors running through
hospital hallways. Running in slow
motion not for dramatic effect, but
to compensate for the eight minutes
Marenghi didn’t have script to fill.
The picture is faded and sound out
of sync. In one scene, Dag goes
to leave Reed’s office. He stops…
“Wait one moment”, commands
Reed. Another sees Dag and Reed
shooting at a demon. “Boom, boom”
fires Reed. The camera switches.
“Bang” shoots Dag, Reed stands
straight. The camera returns: Reed
still trigger-happy. There are many,
many hilarious touches. Darkplace
takes our nostalgia and runs away
with it, then makes it explode into
millions of pieces. Incidentally,
Marenghi knows what it’s like to
explode. Don’t ask him why: he just
knows.
It’s been a while since Darkplace
was aired. I cannot understand
why this isn’t on DVD yet! Maybe
Garth Marenghi doesn’t want to be
responsible for an insomnia epi-
demic. Imagine it being released on
Betamax to complete the retro feel.
Heck, I’d buy a player just for this.
Whatever, this must be released.
Channel 4: your arse is grass and
I’m the lawnmower, you dig?
