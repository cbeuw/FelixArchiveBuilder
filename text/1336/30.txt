Our last scheduled match was a
home game against Queen Mary’s
4ths, who haven’t won a single game
this season – so of course an easy
win! …Not quite. After spend-
ing what seemed an eternity finding
these (now no longer) home courts
in some random area in Kensal
Green, and being quite tempted to
give up along the way and retire
for a drink in one of the Halloween
decorated pubs, we arrived to find
some admittedly cute, so of course
non-imperial, footballers. All is good
until we realise there are no…posts!
Yes a netball court with no net-
ball posts – smart! By now Queen
Mary’s were already making their
way from Mile End – fair play long
way to come for no match. So out
of the kindness of our hearts, and
seeing as we were all there anyway,
we decided to at least take them
for a drink – had quite an amusing
session playing a random fruit and
tube-line game…don’t ask I have no
idea. So anyway, when we asked to
re-schedule the match they tell us
they can’t because they don’t have
the time…but wait, they’re happy to
fit in a friendly…!?!?!? Losers – they
knew we’d whoop their, not so trim,
arses! So we are now officially anti
Queen Mary’s!
Ok now I’ve got that out of my
system, our match against Kings
was a scrapped victory, but a victory
all the same. It was an away match,
so planning ahead; we arranged to
meet at South Ken station to make
our way to Canada Water where
kindly one of their team members
would pick us up, giving us enough
time to warm up and practise a few
plays. However, as we’re jinxed
with our travel, it took us twice the
time to get there due to the Jubilee
deciding to be gay (excuse my non-
PC’ness) and stop-starting along
the way. Reaching nearly half an
hour late, we started almost straight
away – with no centre bib.
We set off with great strength,
taking the lead and keeping major-
ity of the possession. Even though
we were playing well, there were
still some basic errors being made,
which Kings took well advantage of.
They pulled off a one goal difference
in the first quarter, extending it to
two by half time, and in the third
quarter we were 14-9 down, but that
wasn’t about to put us off! The last
quarter was our quarter – we domi-
nated the court and made the game
ours!
The ref was quite blatantly against
us from the start, with one of her
favourite calls being contact, even
though the player meant to be on

Thirsty for the win!
the receiving end of our ‘foul play’
was half way across the court, and
poor Ashley was her favourite victim
– but in her defence, she was quite
a big girl to try and get around.
The other being delayed play - that
means our players weren’t getting
back fast enough for the centre pass-
es – bull! As Anjali quite correctly
put it, “We were literally sprinting
back…her big arse couldn’t get back
any faster!” (I warned you I’d be
quoting).
After a quick pep talk we came
back on for the final quarter, all guns
blazing, looking for no less than a
win. Taking the first 5 goals, which
brought us up to 14 all, the win was
at our fingertips. The final quarter
showed true drive and determina-
tion of all the girls – Jade even went
for goal outside the D! After the fifth
goal, Kings managed to get their
mitts on the ball and started scor-
ing, the game went up to 16 all - all
hearts stopped for the final minute,
there was no way we were settling
for a draw. Then, in the last few sec-
onds, a fab-tastic goal – sneaking it
in before Cruella could blow the final
whistle. What a high! Adrenaline
rushing we got back in time for a
quick drink at the union. Special
congratulations to Tombo for win-
ning player of the match…again.
Well played girls – a deserving win,
they wanted it, but we wanted it
more!
A score that would not look out of
place posted upon the pavilion at a
local cricket ground ensured that
Wye’s 100% unbeaten start to the
season remained intact. It became
apparent from kick-off that the game
could potentially become a ‘walk in
the park,’ and it did so with the men
in blue initiating a high tempo pass-
ing game. With the bagging of of our
first goal, we settled into a rhythm
in which we began to express our
refreshing flowing brand of attack-
ing football. This relaxation brought
with it an onslaught of shots, pep-
pering a visibly quivering Rochester
goal.
“ a good days work
from every player”
Milton and Nick showed their pace
out wide and provided excellent
delivery for our front pairing of Ian
and Rich, whilst being backed up
excellently by full backs Lucas and
Kieron. A Formidable engine room
manned by Jack and Max ran the
Show in the middle of the park, mir-
rored by Wye’s best looking couple
Chris and Jamie sweeping up any-
thing at the back. Wye’s strength
in depth was made all too clear
with the addition of Calder, Jay and
Millsy at half time. Special mention
to stand-in goalie JD, as with all the
action in our box the crowd were
concerned had turned to stone!
The net was burst seven times
in the first half before a reshuf-
fled second half team improved on
this with eight scorchers! There
were plenty more goals in it with a
number of spurned Wye opportuni-
ties but I suppose we should be
content with 15!!
“A score that would
not look out of place
posted upon the pavil-
ion at a local cricket
ground”
Another positive was the contin-
ued solidity at the back- wye are still
yet to concede this season! All in all,
a good days work from every player
as the lads continue to march on
relentlessly!!

What can I say? A truly stunning
match was played by the RSM
Ladies Hockey team last Wednesday
against a very nasty Reading 4ths.
We set out from campus for the long
drive out to Reading with our usual
number of 9 players, to be met by
another team of 14 with rolling subs.
Why do all our matches seem to be
the other team’s tryouts? Anyway,
a quick warm-up in the freezing
cold and we got underway. The first
half was especially tricky for us as
they were fielding 11 players so 2
messy goals slipped past our keeper
Rachel. However we fought back
with an awesome play up the wing
from Heather and a very neat goal
from Lucy – our first of the sea-
son no less! Two minutes later, and
against a very sloppy Reading, we
were even with another goal from
our frontman Dasha. As play con-
tinued we managed to send one of
their girls off with a neat stick-chin
contact from Charlotte, and some
flying sticks from me, but to no avail
and half time ended 4-2.
Some words of encouragement
from our two lovely cheerleaders
in the form of Mike and Sam and
we were back out on an even pitch
playing 9-all. Everyone upped their
game in the second half and we
became the dominant team, with
Alice snatching many a posses-
sion from right under their noses.
Reading in their desperation turned
to complaining to the umpires and
rugby tackling our girls on the pitch,
even managing to take out our lady-
of-the-match Lucy. Some great
defending from Dawn and Charlotte
kept out their lousy attempts at
another goal, and with Stacey and
Dasha up front we managed anoth-
er stunning one taking the score to
4-3 (even if it did go in off the goal-
wheel and not the post!). Minutes
later the final whistle blew and it
was all over, but with such breath-
taking play it won’t be long until we
are racing up the league! Massive
thanks to everyone that played – a
truly inspiring match!
A not so friendly
friendly!
It was a remarkably pleasant
November morning, the sun was
out and the water was flat. Even
more notable, though, was the
sight of over 500 racing boats lining
the banks of the Thames between
Brentford Dock and Chiswick Pier
(that’s almost 4 miles!) They were
all waiting for one thing - the chance
to race the ‘Championship Course’,
from Mortlake to Putney in the
Fours Head of the River.
At just after 12:30, the horn sound-
ed and they were off! The proces-
sional race was led away under
Chiswick Bridge by a quad scull
packed with GB international row-
ers, but the chase was on as the
following crews looked to make their
mark on the race. The first IC crew
down was the ‘Senior 2’ quad of Ben
Smith, Ed Johnson, Will Laughton
and George Whittaker. This was the
top priority crew for the club, but the
guys didn’t appear to be feeling the
pressure as they came through the
start looking smooth and controlled.
And so it went on, with boat after
boat setting off to tackle the gruel-
ling 20 minute course. Among them
were another 10 IC crews, includ-
ing three from this year’s promising
women’s’ squad. Also in the mix, for
the eagle-eyed amongst us, was one
James Cracknell, who picked up an
oar again for the first time since last
year’s Olympics as a last minute sub
for his club, Leander.
Eventually, after over 2 hours of
racing, the last of the crews made it
through the finish. From this point,
all we could do was to wait for the
results to be worked out by the race
organisers, and what better place to
wait than the bar…
A few pints and a quick down-
load from the race website later and
we had those all important results.
Initially there was a bit of disap-
pointment as it turned out that none
of our crews had actually won their
events. However, there were some
good performances all round. The
men’s quad came in 13th overall and
4th in their category, seven seconds
behind the victors. Even closer still
was the top men’s coxed four, who
put together a strong race to finish
2nd in the ‘Senior 1’ category, less
than 2 seconds adrift of the winners.
Further down the field, the 3 ‘Senior
2’ coxless fours were 5th, 14th and
15th, and the ‘Senior 1’ coxless four
was 9th. Also putting up a good
fight was the top ‘Senior 3’ coxed
crew, who, despite having to carry
Connie down the course with them,
managed to beat one of the coxless
fours and also finished a creditable
3rd in their category, with the ‘B’
crew further back in 13th place. The
girls also came up with some useful
results - the top quad finished as the
8th fastest women’s’ crew overall
(5th in their category), with the 2nd
quad not too far behind them (8th
in the same category). Last but not
least was the girls’ ‘Senior 3’ coxed
four, who fought their way through
to 11th position in their category
despite having a 2 hour wait at the
start.
With the evening ahead of us, and
with many people already pretty far
gone (alcohol is surprisingly quick
to affect you after a period of intense
physical exertion!), the dance floor
at our neighbours, Thames Rowing
Club, began to draw the punters in.
Predictably, a night of crazy, drunk-
en ‘dancing’ and general debauch-
ery ensued. There were of course
some less predictable occurrences,
but I don’t think I’ll go into them
here... (There’s a time and a place,
and neither of them involve this
issue of Felix!)
So, all in all, a good start to the
main racing season. We definitely
all need to put some work in over the
coming months, but now we know
where we stand, and what we’ve got
to aim for...
On another note, I feel that a men-
tion should be made of those boys
and girls from the club who made
the trip to Boston (Lincs’ not USA)
for the first GB international trials of
the year. Of particular note were the
performances of George, who came
home 4th in men’s heavyweight,
and new-boy Will, who pulled out an
astounding 8th position in his first
senior level trials. We’ll have to wait
and see how the season unfolds, but
there’s certainly promise there in
terms of potential international rep-
resentation - fingers crossed.
