Play without the politics
5-a-side Football
OSC World Cup
Champions 2005:- Iran FC
Jasmine Sze
Bright and early last Saturday
12th of November saw a gaggle of
Imperial’s most keen footballers
from 16 national societies warm-
ing up together at Paddington
Recreation Ground. What brought
this diverse group of young men
and women (Yes! There were female
players too) out into the bitter cold
at 9am? It was the opportunity to
play for their country and their pride
in the annual Overseas Students
Committee World Cup.
This year the OSC World
Cup was the culmination of a week’s
worth of events organised at IC to
commemorate RiseWeek, a London-
wide anti-racism campaign. The
tournament spanned the whole
day with 15 minutes 5-a-side quali-
fiers followed by 10 minutes quarter
and semi-finals. Sandwiches and
refreshments were served to foot-
ballers courtesy of the OSC. The
excitement rose to fever pitch as Iraq
came head-to-head with Iran FC,
and Sherfield United played Abacus
in the semi-finals. Congratulations
go to the winners, Iran FC, and
the runners-up, Sherfield United,
who battled it out in a nail-biting
20-minute final. All in all it was a
wonderful day out, with tournament
participants already calling for a
sequel next term. A big thank you
goes to the participating teams, all
of which showed good sportsman-
ship and exemplified the spirit of
diversity and tolerance that was the
inspiration for the event.
Look out for posters
about the next Overseas Students
Committee production, A Sense of
the World, a cultural extravaganza
of fashion and food organised in
conjunction with IC FashionSoc. A
Sense of the World will be held on
Wednesday 30th November in the
MDH, with tickets on sale in the
JCR during lunchtimes this week
and next.

AIDS awareness week
at Imperial College
26/11 – 2/12

We are the champions of the World!
How do you find time and space to
think – or just to be – in the middle
of busy college life? It’s a strug-
gle for many of us – so much is
going on that it’s hard to find some
peace and quiet to let go of it all for
a few minutes, or to think about
the way we relate and respond to
specific issues in the world. Next
week, the Chaplaincy is providing
two opportunities to help you create
that space.
“respond creatively
– or simply respond by
lighting a candle”
On Monday we’re holding an event
called A Journey to Stillness. It
offers you a chance to be still in the
middle of a busy day. We start with a
short meditation so that people can
let go of the rushing around and anx-
ieties of everyday life. You are then
invited to continue the meditation by
walking into a labyrinth, which rep-
resents a journey to stillness. The
labyrinth has just one path (unlike a
maze) and allows you to walk with-
out having to decide which route
to take. This act of walking can be
very calming, and for many people is
easier than sitting still. People who
have used our labyrinth before have
found it very relaxing, and enjoyed
having a structured time of quiet.
Labyrinths arise at different times
in history and in different cultures
from around the world, so they are
open to anyone rather than being
linked to just one religious tradi-
tion. A Journey to Stillness is in the
Union Dining Hall from 1.10 – 1.45.
From Tuesday to Friday between
9.30am and 5.00pm, to tie in with
Medsin’s Positively Red events
for World Aids Week, we are hold-
ing Reflect & Respond: Why are
you wearing a red ribbon on World
Aids Day? This installation in the
Chaplaincy prayer room offers a
range of resources and activities, for
people of any faith or none, to reflect
on and respond to HIV and Aids.
You will be able to encounter voices
of people affected by HIV through
resources from the National AIDS
trust, and think about your own
response to HIV and Aids and why
you wear a red ribbon. You can
add to our red ribbon paper chain
as a sign of solidarity and to repre-
sent the diverse ways people are
affected by HIV. You’ll also be able
to reflect on some of the challenges
HIV presents us with and respond
creatively – or simply respond by
lighting a candle. Reflect & Respond
presents you with a variety of things
to read, look at, think about and do,
and you can engage with whichever
ones you choose to.
“How do you find time
and space to think?”
Both events are free and there’s
no need to sign up in advance. If
you’ve ever wished you could find a
moment of peace during your busy
day at college, one of these events
could be a good place to start. Go
to www.chaplaincy.imperial.ac.uk or
contact us on chaplaincy@imperial.
ac.uk for more information.
