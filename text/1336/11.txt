LIVE REVIEWS
I received an email from my senior
tutor bemoaning the improper use
of the halls network for pirating
copyrighted material. It’s a shame
that piracy is frowned on, because
if this were widely enforced, people
would have no chance to access the
back catalogue of the Decemberists’
work. With only their latest album,
Picaresque, due for release in the
UK (on Rough Trade this sum-
mer), the full excellence of this
band of whimsical buccaneers from
Portland, Oregon is in danger of
going unnoticed in this country.
The support, San Fransisco two-
piece act Two Gallants, with their
“off-the-heezy” guitar work and
vocals reminiscent of the tortured
strains of Bright Eyes and the tor-
tured strains of Kurt Cobain, pro-
duced a wall of noise meant to pick
you up, throw you about and deny
you any rest until the end of their
set. Their brand of Americana, with
it’s lyrics about murder and alcohol-
ism, made them rather more than
the White Stripes knockoff they
seemed at first sight, and definitely
worth looking out for.
As the Decemberists came on,
fears that the small stage of ULU
would be unable to accommodate
their big band sound were instant-
ly dismissed as the opened their
set with The Infanta. The crowd’s
unusual familiarity with the songs
(stemming, presumably, from piracy
of copyrighted material) was evident
as, in a feverish mood, they belted
out each one in unison with front-
man Colin Meloy’s geeky voice.
From the off, the Decemberists
were a joy to watch. It is gener-
ally joked that a master’s degree in
English is required to follow their
lyrics -- not a baseless claim as
each song moves easily between
articulately witty and atmospheric;
an example is Eli The Barrow Boy,
their contribution to the long tradi-
tion of murder ballads. Their songs
are sometimes political as well, but
not hysterically so: witness their
latest single, the anthemic Sixteen
Military Wives, an incisive but sub-
tle look at America’s political situ-
ation.
Throughout, the interaction with
the audience was superior, with the
band treating the show as a surreal
indie pantomime. Between each
song, Colin bantered with the crowd,
and the band introduced humour-
ous ad hoc elements, like a random
violin rendition of the Indiana Jones
theme in the middle of the escape-
themed Bagman’s Gambit. Later,
it heated up as multi-instrumen-
talist and Red Army Robin Hood
Chris Funk “fell asleep” mid-song,
prompting Colin to force us to sit
down so he could rest undisturbed.
It all came to a head during the
finale, the epic Mariner’s Revenge
Song as the crowd were instructed
to “scream like a whale is chewing
you up”, leaving us with a bizarre
mix of well-pitched pirate-rock and
screams of “Bloody hell! It has
teeth!” ringing in our ears.
The Decemberists are one of those
rare bands, absurd yet compelling,
who tax the eyes, ears and brain all
at once. Showing more originality in
one show than most band’s careers,
they’ve certainly earned the self-
applied name of their second album,
Her Majesty. Long may she reign.

After a typical indie-rock perform-
ance from the Bright Space, and
a less than inspiring perform-
ance from ‘girl with a guitar type’
Gemma Hayes, anticipation was
high for Athlete’s 2nd performance
at the Hammersmith Apollo on
this tour. Athlete enter the stage to
the thunderous roar of applause.
Having waited a good few minutes
for the adulation from their fans to
die down, they played the popular
Yesterday Threw Everything At Me
and Half-light, which were unsur-
prisingly chanted back to Athlete by
the crowd word for word. From the
reaction of the crowd and the magi-
cal atmosphere that Athlete create
with such ease, it becomes apparent
that this home-coming gig is going
to be something special.
Athlete continue to pull out crowd-
pleasers, breaking into favourites
from their debut album Vehicles And
Animals. Athlete’s first ever single,
the sing-along favourite Westside
and New Project with its slow intro
lulling you into a false sense of
calm, prior to hitting you with the
crazy electronic unexpected middle
section go down a treat. Beautiful
turns the venue into a ball of hap-
piness and love, momentarily wash-
ing away any qualms anybody has,
leaving the feeling, albeit it false, of
perfection within the world.
Athlete then ingeniously, yet effort-
lessly manage to make the gig seem
tailor made to every individual lucky
enough to be in the room. The gigan-
tic curtains behind the band glide
open to reveal a huge screen, with a
street map of London. Then On Your
Street commences, and the crowd
are taken on a journey through
London- through St James’s Park,
Notting Hill, Islington, Charing
Cross and more, accompanied by
gasps, cheers and ahhs as people
see the familiar streets where they
live, work and grew up. The song
somewhat predictably, but no less
specially ends with the map zoom-
ing into the Hammersmith Apollo.
After a few more popular tracks
from their albums, Athlete then
manage to make a gig that is already
turning out to be pretty awesome,
just that little bit extra special, play-
ing their emotionally charged tear-
jerker Wires. As Joel Potts beauti-
fully sings the well known lyrics, you
feel sorry for anybody that doesn’t
have somebody to hold, as thou-
sands of friends and lovers embrace
throughout the song. Despite the
well documented and discussed,
and lets be honest, blatantly obvious
inspiration for the song (Joel Potts
‘running down corridors, through
automatic doors, got to get to’ his
prematurely new-born and ill baby)
an unusual twist is taken on the
screen. Whilst most people know
that the wires refer to those coming
from his ill daughter, the screens
take the crowd on another jour-
ney, along the wires of the London
underground-yet again, making the
gig feel that little bit more personal.
After leaving the stage, and return-
ing for a much-called for encore,
Athlete end their spectacular gig
with new single 24 Hours (which I
have been credibly informed was
not written about Jack Bauer or the
US show 24) and leave the stage to
huge cheering and miscellaneous
noise. Athlete can do no wrong and
appeal to an impressive range of
people. They have the potential to
be huge, and hopefully, their next
album will secure them a deserved
place as British musical legends.

Athlete, having spent the last few
months in the U.S. returned to the
U.K. to play a sellout U.K. tour. We
were lucky enough to be given the
opportunity to meet and interview
Athlete drummer Steve Roberts
before their gig at the Hammersmith
Apollo on the 2nd October.
As we were escorted to the Athlete
dressing room, we were unsure what
to expect from a band that have had
such main stream success over the
last year, with the release of their
latest album Tourist. As soon as
we were inside and politely offered
beers, any visions of rock and roll
debauchery were shattered. Steve
was very down to earth, with his
physics teacher glasses and beard
reflecting his unphased attitude
towards fame and success.
Having seen Athlete play a few
weeks before in the Apple Store,
Regent Street, we asked about the
performance and how it felt to play
a much more intimate set than unu-
sual. Surprisingly beforehand they
were dreading playing the clean
white store with its clinical sterile
atmosphere. Once they got on stage
to the huge applause and the loud
drunk guy in the front row they
really let loose and enjoyed playing
more personal stripped down acous-
tic renditions of their classic hits to
the 400 strong crowd.
Despite hitting the “big time” with
the release of their latest album
Tourist, Athlete’s rise to the top
was through relentless touring,
slowly but surely building up a fan-
base since the release of Vehicles
& Animals. When asked about the
current music scene and young
emerging bands, they dismissed any
comparisons to the Brit-pop era.
They share the feeling that Brit-pop
was an era of one image and one
sounds, where now all genres and
styles are embraced with the same
person listening to The Streets,
Morning Runner, Basement Jaxx
and Roots Manuva. The embracing
of such a diverse collection of music
is likely to nourish many of the U.K.
music scenes, which can only be a
good thing.
