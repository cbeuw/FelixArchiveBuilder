Scorpio (Oct 23rd – Nov 21st)
Feeling frisky? Stay
away from oysters,
asparagus and other
aphrodisiacs this
week, trust me, your
friends will be thank-
ing you for it.
Sagittarius (Nov 22nd – Dec 21st)
One step forward and
two steps back... Stop
dancing around your
worries this week,
instead take the lead
and show them a
quick left hock to the jaw.
Capricorn (Dec 22nd – Jan 19th)
I have seen your fate
in the cards!! Take
heart from this week-
ends’ events, although
you may later flush at
the thought.
Aquarius (Jan 20th – Feb 18th)
Why stop at cloud 9? A
certain someone will
be putting a smile on
your face and butter-
flies in your stomach.
Just go with the flow.
Pisces (Feb 19th – Mar 20th)
Honey. You’ve been
had! You are par-
ticularly gullible this
week so watch out for
people trying to lead
you down the garden
path!
Aries (Mar 21st - Apr 20th)
Don’t try to be too
ambitious this week,
take things bite size
for now! You may feel
there’s nothing you
can’t handle, beware
of biting more than you can chew or
you might end up wondering what
the hell went wrong.
Taurus (Apr 21st - May 21st)
Oh oh! Someone has
this bull by the horns,
wrapped around their
little finger, beware
of being the doormat
that people walk right
over.
Gemini (May 22nd – Jun 21st)
You may think all
is sweet as pie, but
watch out for those
little sour apples who
want to spoil your
week. Revenge is a
dish best served cold.
Cancer (Jun 22nd – Jul 22nd)
Someone’s been sam-
pling the menu this
week, as crabs is on
the recommended list.
Make the most of it as,
being on top doesn’t
last that long.
Leo (Jul 23rd – Aug 22nd)
You may be a lit-
tle careless so try
to avoid making
mistakes! If you do;
remember it happens
to the best of us. Then
get over it!
Virgo (Aug 23rd – Sep 22nd)
Broken promises
aren’t pretty, so think
carefully before a
loved one gets hurt.
You’re great at think-
ing on your feet, so
put those skills to work.
Libra (Sept 23rd - Oct 22nd)
The whole world feels
like it’s caving in on
you and you don’t
know why. Talk to
someone you’d never
usually confide in.
You’ll be surprised
how a stranger’s opinion can help.
Falling without her...
Dear Miss C,
I know that gravitation is not
responsible for people falling in
love but I have fallen for this girl.
She is very sweet and nice to me
but only treats me as a friend. I
tried to take her out for dinner but
she always responds by saying
‘no need and not to waste time
and money on her.’ I bought her
a present last week but she told
me it’s not necessary and it won’t
change anything. I really like her.
What shall I do?
Love Hurts
Dear Love Hurts,
My my my!! Someone can’t take
no for an answer. As sweet as
your being and a nice as you
seem its time to cut your losses.
Unfortunately in this case it seems
that the nice guy does finish last, as
she’s just not interested. What you
have to see is that it’s her loss and
some other lucky girls gain; I can
always enter you into the Felix blind
date draw when you start looking!!
In future don’t try so hard, it seems
like you’re trying to buy her love.
It’s the nicest thing to get a gift
when your dating, but when your
not interested and people don’t take
no for an answer, it can get slightly
scary and almost stalker like. My
advice is sadly to move on, and in
future take it slowly. Next time you
get the urge to splurge, remember
lil old me!?? I always love a good
present!! ;)
Homoskeptic...
Dear Miss C
I don’t like gay’s full stop, but I
masturbate over a transsexual in
lingerie. I think this is sick in real
life and would never try it and now
when having sex I can’t get a hard
on without thinking about this and
this is hard and off putting.
Har Dick
Dear Har Dick,
Ummm, right well as I’m a girl,
obviously I have had loads of
experience in this matter, but I’ll
see what I can do. Now you have a
few options; my medic friends tell
me that the transsexual op take
place every Thursday at Charing
X, so you could go and find yourself
a new partner or next time you
get the urge to drag out the Nadia
wannabees try taking a cold shower
and going cold turkey. Perhaps you
could try your hand at ‘normal’
porn?? Why not try focusing on
your partner for excitement, unless
of course it’s a drunken night out
and she might cause your dinner to
reappear. To be fair if you’re under
the influence you’re gonna have
problems getting it up anyway.
Otherwise put it down to your
urge to experiment (I’d try Ann
Summers in future!!) and embrace
your new feelings. Good luck with
that and let me now how it goes.
Return of the rant...
Dear Miss C,
I have another love problem! I sit
behind these asylum bars looking
at butterflies slowly die in the
sunlight.
I’ve recently fallen for this woman.
She’s amazing and charms me
like nothing I’ve ever come across.
Including the crack in the wall I
find myself studying for hours.
However, she is being seen by this
man who comes every Sunday
to play the organs for the church.
Usually I sit strapped in a straight
jacket so I can’t take even the
smallest bite out of him. But I spit
at his face with my eyes whenever
he looks my way. He has bewitched
my woman, even though he only
works in a funeral service! If they
hadn’t taken my cloak and ring
away I could become invisible and
find out what he really gets up to!
But here I am locked away
just because I can see these
transparent worms coming out of
people telling me there future! Oh
and because of you. And mostly
my room mate who woke up
with me studying him, the police
wouldn’t listen to my explanations
regarding the quest for face
equations.
I wish that queen’s tower was open
more often so I could prove you
can fly as long as you think happy
thoughts and can actively miss the
ground.
Xenebicci Aka Nobody
Dear Nobody,
Well as a returning lost soul
requiring my help I thought I
should try attempt to advise your
ramblings, hopefully leading to a
happier ending than in the green
mile.
Now, your love life, firstly as you’ve
met in an asylum, this isn’t looking
promising, especially as you’re
doing a Hannibal Lecter. Secondly
she’s a taken woman, even if it is
by an undertaker. Hey whatever
makes her happy right? Now I feel
that your medication has kicked
in and you now believe that you’re
Frodo. Repeat after me, LOTR
was not real!!! You cannot become
invisible; else you would have long
escaped from the prison in which
you currently find yourself! I’d
cut your losses and try and find
someone else. Even better, get well,
get released, and find someone
worthy of your insanity, perhaps a
female Donny Darko?
Now I’m sorry I had to alert the
police, but I had serious fear for
both your flatmate’s and your own
safety, can you blame me when you
dream of being peter pan??
Heed my words, and all will be well.
Until we meet again…..
Dear Miss Conﬁdentiality...
Hey guys! As I’m a sucker for
romance I had to let Love hurts
win, but keep the questions
coming, I’m here to answer
all you can throw at me! Films
tickets for the winner again next
