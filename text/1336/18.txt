If you like the idea of adding a lit-
tle glamour to your wardrobe, use
the above materials to make the
Russian look. Excess is best when
it comes to pulling off this. For girls,
think Ivana Trump, but tone it down
just a little! For boys however, this
look is slightly modified and called
the Military look. You’ve probably
seen Pete Doherty wearing a jack-
ets and hats that look like he’s come
straight out of the Crimea. Many
have mixed views on this man, but
his style epitomises what this look is
all about. Very cool.
The world of fashion has brought
out its Spring/Summer collections
already. Already?! You’ve only
just sorted out winter look, but if
you want to make the most of the
January sales then look at the new
collections to find out what’s hot and
what’s not in 2006.
The general theme of the new col-
lections is the Italian Rivera; linen
jackets and white shirts for boys and
floral dresses for girls. Lovely, you
might think, but sometimes major
fashion houses can do bizarre things
with nice ideas. I think the design-
ers at Christian Lacriox have been
watching too many old movies as the
models in their new collection look
very much like extras from Summer
Holiday (ah, Cliff will be pleased).
Louis Vuitton has mixed schoolboy
with Italian businessman, resulting
in a confused look. The shorts, with
shirt and tie look is interesting, but
maybe a little “out there” for my
taste! Alexander McQueen has kept
his collection surprisingly simple
with modest, light shirts and trou-
sers building most of the new look.
His models looked beautiful in their
white and biscuit outfits with tanned
skin, who knows, maybe the Italian
look will payoff after all?

Many styles are around this season.
So to make the most of that ever-
decreasing overdraft I will help you
make sure you find the look that
suits you best.
Have you looked at shop window
displays recently? Urban Outfitters,
Monsoon, Kookai and countless oth-
ers have gone for black displays.
Black is definitely back this sea-
son, so don’t be afraid to darken up
this winter, with lace shedding its
gothic guise and re-emerging as an
enchantingly romantic option, the
Black Widow has never been more
sexy.
Black seems to be the order of
the day with such styles such as
the Houndstooth and Monochrome
looks. Be careful not to overdo
the Houndstooth. Generally this
pattern is best on either coats or
skirts. In my first page as fash-
ion editor I mentioned the Beatnik
look, inspired by Edie Sedgwick.
The monochrome look incorporates
Beatnik, but you can also hark back
to the eighties Two Tone movement-
just make sure it’s black!
Fashion often likes to mimic the
animal kingdom. This winter sev-
eral textures have made this idea
big again- velvet, fur, sheepskin
and feathers. If you haven’t bought
your winter coat yet, sheepskin and
fur will keep you toasty and warm.
However I fail to see its appeal,
as many coats on the high street
will use synthetic fabrics to create
these (the use of fur is not only high
street taboo, but totally immoral).
So, if you want opulent winter
chic, turn to velvet. At the premiere
of “Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire”, Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint
and Robert Pattinson (who plays
the luscious Cedric Diggory) wore
velvet jackets. Although they all
looked dashing on the red carpet, it
was Pattinson who looked the best.
The trick to wearing velvet well is to
have it only on the collar and cuffs
of a jacket if you’re going to wear
more than one item that contains
the material. Radcliff wore a green
velvet jacket and waistcoat with
green trousers, whereas Pattinson
wore only a black velvet jacket with
white shirt and jeans.
For those ladies who have var-
ious balls and dinners to go to,
how about adding some black or
white feathers to a strapless dress?
Plumes exude bird-of-paradise
flamboyance and give classic styles
a glamorous touch.

Beauty
“you want to
make the most
of the January
Sales” This winter’s fabric seems to be
velvet and silk. So if you’re going
to go all out on winter chic, make
sure that your make-up is just
as opulent. Metallic eye shadow
and cheek highlighter will add
that frosty look to any outfit.
Benefit have a wonderful range
of body and face metal cream, in
various shades of gold to match
all skin colours. They also have
some gorgeous eyeliner pens,
my favourite being “gilded” (see
above). But if you’re an indie
girl and prefer the Beatnik look,
make sure that you have the
perfected the look of wide-eyed
innocence. Although some of
you may not have mastered the
art of applying eyeliner to your
upper eyelids, this is something
that is worth investing a little
time in doing. Eyeliner on the
upper eyelids makes even those
with thin lashes look luscious
and thick! However, if you sim-
ply cannot get the art right and
end up looking like a panda, fear
not - false eyelashes are here! I
tend to steer clear of the blast-
ed things as a dear friend once
melted hers while opening the
oven door. In last week’s X Factor
Kate Thornton oozed fifties sex
appeal with her black bolero and
red corset. But what really made
her stand out was of course her
red lipstick! I have it on good
authority that she is every bit as
beautiful in real life as she is on
the show. So for the Hourglass
look of high maintenance secre-
tary, make sure that while wear-
ing your pencil skirt that you can
only shuffle in, those fishnet tights
that keep snag-
ging on table
corners and
stiletto heels
that are sim-
ply impossible,
you also wear
red lipstick.
This timeless
classic should
of course be
bought from
the empire
that personi-
fies chic, Coco
Chanel.
