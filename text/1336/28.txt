It all started as the Bioengineering
society organised a trip to the
Windsor castle for the whole depart-
ment on the 22nd of October. For
those of you who don’t know Windsor
Castle is an official residence of
The Queen and the largest occupied
castle in the world. A Royal home
and fortress for over 900 years, the
Castle remains a working palace
today. Over a period of nearly 1,000
years it has been inhabited continu-
ously, and altered and refurbished
by successive monarchs. Some were
great builders, strengthening the
Castle against uprising and rebel-
lion; others, living in more peace-
ful times, created a palatial Royal
residence.
William the Conqueror chose the
site, high above the river Thames
and on the edge of a Saxon hunting
ground. It was a day’s march from
the Tower of London and intended
to guard the western approaches
to the capital. The outer walls of
today’s structure are in the same
position as those of the original cas-
tle built by William the Conqueror
in the 1070s. So too is the central
mound supporting the Round Tower
and the Upper Ward, where suc-
cessive monarchs have had their
private apartments since the four-
teenth century.
In the 1170s Henry II rebuilt - in
stone instead of wood - the Round
Tower, the outer walls of the Upper
and most of the Lower Ward, and
the Royal apartments in the Upper
Ward. In the 1360s Edward III, who
was born at Windsor, extended the
Castle. He created the immense St.
George’s Hall for the use of the
Knights of his newly founded Order
of the Garter. Oliver Cromwell
captured Windsor Castle after the
Battle of Edgehill in 1642, and for
the rest of the Civil War it became a
prison as well as the headquarters
of the parliamentary forces. In 1648
Charles I was held there before his
trial and execution in London.
Following the Restoration, Charles
IIwasdeterminedtomaketheCastle
as splendid as possible. He created
a new set of State Apartments in the
1670s, using the skills of the archi-
tect Hugh May, the artist Antonio
Verrio for murals and ceiling paint-
ings, and the famous wood-carver
Grinling Gibbons. The King’s Dining
Room and the Queen’s Presence and
Audience Chambers retain many of
these original features. Charles II
also laid out the 5km Long Walk
leading due south from the Castle
into Windsor Great Park.
George IV was a great lover of art
andfinedecoration.MuchofWindsor
Castle’s present appearance is due
to the alterations he instigated in
the 1820s with his architect, Sir
Jeffry Wyatville. The buildings were
refashioned in the Gothic style, with
the addition of crenellations, tur-
rets and towers. In the Upper Ward
the private apartments were moved
from the north side of the quadran-
gle to the south and east side. The
rooms on the north side were desig-
nated, as now, as for use on formal
occasions and State visits. One of
George IV’s most remarkable addi-
tions was the Waterloo Chamber,
which was created in the 1820s to
show portraits commissioned from
Sir Thomas Lawrence to commemo-
rate the defeat of Napoleon at the
battle of Waterloo in 1815. They
represent the monarchs, soldiers
and statesmen who were involved
in that defeat and its aftermath.
They include George III, George IV
and the future William IV, the Duke
of Wellington, Field Marshal von
Blücher, the Emperors of Austria
and Russia, the Kings of Prussia
and France, and Pope Pius VII.
The twentieth-century history of
the Castle is dominated by the major
fire that started on 20 November
1992. It began in the Private Chapel,
when a spotlight came into contact
with a curtain and ignited the mate-
rial. It took 15 hours and one-and-a-
half million gallons of water to put
out the blaze. Nine principal rooms
and over 100 other rooms over an
area of 9,000 square metres were
damaged or destroyed by the fire,
approximately one-fifth of the Castle
area.
The next five years were spent
restoring Windsor Castle to its
former glory. It resulted in the
greatest historic building project to
have been undertaken in this coun-
try in the twentieth century, reviving
many traditional crafts.
Windsor Castle may be 900 years
old, but it continues to play a large
part in the official work of The Queen
and members of the Royal Family.
Today The Queen uses the Castle
both as a private home, where she
usually spends the weekend, and
as a Royal residence at which she
undertakes certain formal duties.
The traditional State Banquet is
held in St George’s Hall (55.5m long
and 9m wide), with a table seating
up to 160 guests. This table was
humongous I tell you and it looked
well, “majestic”.
The magnificent State Apartments
are furnished with some of the fin-
est works of art from the Royal
Collection, including paintings by
Rembrandt, Rubens, Canaletto,
Gainsborough and the famous triple
portrait of Charles I by Sir Anthony
van Dyck.
In the 1992 fire by good fortune the
rooms worst affected were empty
at the time, and as a result, few of
the Castle’s artistic treasures were
destroyed. The highly acclaimed
restoration work, completed in 1997,
is a testament to the extraordinary
skills of some of the finest craftsmen
in Europe.
Once we were done with the
castle we went down to the town
centre which reminded me a lot of
Stratford-upon-Avon (Shakespeare’s
birthplace), it had a very traditional
village atmosphere (although with
all the high street shops). We sat by
the river Thames which was only
10 minutes away by walk and remi-
nisced on the enjoyable day we had.
The trip was certainly entertaining
and the castle is well worth going to
if you want to experience this island
nation’s history.
A brush with royalty...
Just a tad more attractive than our monstrosity in South Ken.
