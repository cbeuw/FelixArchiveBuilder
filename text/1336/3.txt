A dressing down for Sir Richard
Two weeks have gone by since
Felix (1334) first reported the dra-
conian dress regulations annouced
by Imperial’s Management Board
stating that all students must wear
their identity cards whilst on college
property and abide by a stringent
dress code. The annoucement has
been causing quite a stir both within
College and wider education com-
munity, the issue features in yester-
day’s Guardian.
If a cursory glance around the
foyer of the Sherfield building is
anything to go by, it appears that
the stern security measures have
fallen upon deaf ears. Curious as
to whether instructing over 10,000
students to wear a red band with
their credentials around their neck
would have any constructive effect
whatsoever, Felix went straight to
the Rector himself.
Armed with the benefit of hind-
sight, Felix spoke to Sir Richard
and the Chief Security Officer for
Operations, Mr Branch, to find out
what exactly is going on and why
people were taking more notice of
the neighbouring Natural History
Museum Ice Rink than they were of
‘immediate’ college policy.
“It’s a question of being sensible and
so this is an overreaction to what
should be a mature debate,” says

Felix’s front page is “an overreac-
tion, to what should be a mature
debate” Sir Richard Sykes
Bioenineering students refused to
attend lectures in their noisy lectur-
er theatre on Friday 11 November.
Instead they held a protest in the
Mechanical Engineering Foyer. The
lecturer theatre in question is locat-
ed in the heart of ongoing construc-
tion work in the Bessemer building,
and has been plagued by disruption
since the start of term.
Concentrating in lectures can be
difficult enough! But the rumble of
floor shaking pneumatic drills often
made it near impossible, leading
to the spontaneous cancellation of
numerous classes. At the end of
October a petition signed by over 140
students was passed to Prof. Richard
Kitney, Dean of Engineering, stating
that the students found their learn-
ing conditions unacceptable.
Prof. John Lever, Head of the
Deptartment of Bioengineering, had
been assured at the beginning of
term that by use of new, advanced
machinery, building noise would be
minimal. He then attempted to solve
the problem by informing the build-
ing works manager of the 2nd year
timetable and instructing him that
no work should take place during
lecture slots. However, the noise
continued regardless, making it
apparent that the only reliable solu-
tion would be to find replacement
lecture theatres.
To address the growing frustra-
tions of students, City and Guilds
College Union (CGCU) President
Siddharth Singh raised the issue
in a meeting with Prof. Julia King,
Head of the Faculty of Engineering.
In feedback from the meeting
Siddharth Singh said, “Someone
should be talking to BioEngineering
and other departments about mov-
ing lectures to another lecture thea-
tre. In any case, Prof. King is also
the champion of this long awaited
project so she is keen that it is over
ASAP
. I can’t stress enough that this
is a short-term problem which will
solve BioEng’s long term wows.”
The response suggested that since
Bioengineering students would be
one of the main beneficiaries of the
new building in the long term they
should put up with the noise for the
short term. However, this seems
to be unfeasible considering that
the building works are planned to
continue well into next year and will
eventually involve the demolition of
the main entrance to the lecture
theatre.
Inthedaysleadinguptotheprotest
Mr Singh urged students not to get
“too excited about the issue”. Some
students regarded this statement
as “patronising… and illustrative
of the resounding apathy that con-
fronted students since they raised
this complaint in the first weeks of
term”. Indeed Singh’s claim that
any strike or room boycott would be
of no help to anyone only served to
make the students more determined
to show that they considered their
studying environment simply unac-
ceptable in an academic institution
as renowned as Imperial College.
Although many would expect the
CGCU to be the one of the primary
bodies to support such actions stu-
dents were instead left high and dry
by the Union. The protest appeared
to bring instant results, with a lec-
turer finding a quiet lecture theatre
in the Deptartment of Aeronautical
Engineering where the students
had the remaining day’s classes. In
an apparent shift of position Singh
later e-mailed the class to “applaud

the protest action”.
Speaking to Felix last week, Prof.
King said, “I wasn’t aware there
was a protest. If I had known I
would have acted sooner - students
deserve an apology as they’ve had a
rotten time”. She added, “we need to
look at the processes to ensure this
doesn’t happen again” but then went
on to say, “there’s no guarantee with
building works, I would like to say it
wouldn’t happen again, but can’t”.
As of last week the second year
students will no longer be return-
ing to the Bessemer Building. They
will, however, be getting a little bit
more exercise between lectures.
Their classes have been relocated
to available rooms in the Tanaka
Business School, Royal School of
Mines, Mechanical Engineering
Building, Huxley Building and ACE
Roderick Hill (Prince Consort Rd.).
Prof King implied that Imperial stu-
dents are lucky “they don’t have to
cycle between lectures like I had to
at Cambridge”.
Despite the fact that plans to move
lectures to these venues had been
made before the protest took place,
the students still voted unanimously
in a meeting with year reps that they
should voice their resentment at
having had to put up with “deplor-
able conditions” for six weeks.
Unfortunately this hasn’t been
the first of their troubles either.
The Undergraduate course in
Bioengineering is one of the smallest
at Imperial with an expected annual
intake of only 50 students. Last year
students saw their medical science
practicals cancelled almost entirely
(due to unavailability of laboratory
space) and their computer room cut
down to a third of its original size.
This was all due to a lack of facili-
ties, which raises the question: is
it right to run a course which does
not have the essential institutional
support to allow it to live up to the
standards expected from a world
class University?

Students protesting at Imperial - Whatever next?
lege’s press officer, Sir Richard con-
tinues, “It’s not a black and white
situation, it’s not a change from
today until tomorrow, it’s just about
being sensible and realistic because
if you see someone in the building,
not out on the road, and they look a
bit odd and you see they’re wearing
a badge, you don’t take any notice.
If they’re not wearing a badge you
think “oh that’s a bit strange” and
if something went wrong and we
didn’t have a system whereby peo-
ple carried identification, then we’d
seriously be in trouble. If you go into
the city today you can’t get into a
building without identification. You
know, fine, we all want to be free and
not have to do this but unfortunately
this is the will of the world today.
We would expect people just to be
mature and sensible about this.”
We took these statements to Terry
Branch, Chief Security Officer, to
find out how strong the College’s
sentiments were being conveyed to
the Security team. Responding to
the perceived lack of compliance
amongst the students, he says
“around 50% are wearing their cards
around campus at the moment, this
will gradually improve once students
get used to it”, however accepts that
there will never be 100% compliance.
Addressing the concerns echoed by
many readers, Mr. Branch tells Felix
that no student shall be thrown off
college property if they forget their
card, providing their identity can be
verified by other means. Students
who outright refuse to display cards,
however, will be dealt with on an
individual basis.
“It’s like any college ruling; there’s
going to be a gradual transition. If
someone says ‘I am not wearing my
card’, I shall treat every instance
differently, on its own merits. From
a security point of view it’s a very
efficient policy, especially consider-
ing the recent thefts from campus
where people are able to stroll off
the street during the day and enter
college buildings”
As far as offensive dress is con-
cerned, “You need to have some sort
of guideline; It’s just officially been
put in writing. If someone com-
plains to us that they find something
offensive, we shall use our com-
mon sense and if necessary discuss
amongst ourselves to judge whether
college intervention is appropriate”.
Yesterday, a Security Officer told
Felix: “We had an intruder enter
Beit Hall on Sunday morning. We
checked camera recordings but
could not identify him, or print a
photo, because he was wearing a
hoodie. One could say this was com-
mon sense, in this cold weather,
yet it prevents us being an effec-
tive security service.”. Hoodies, it
seems, are not banned providing
they aren’t used to cover the face.
Asked whether they were welcome
on college property, considering
the sale of Imperial College hooded
clothing at the Union shop, he replies
“They’re not banned to my knowl-
edge, no”. Common sense seems
to be a recurring theme although
the interpretation of such is very
much still up for debate. Telling
Felix there have been daily briefings
amongst security staff, and no com-
plaints of intimidation or otherwise
have been received relating to this
new guideline, Terry Branch seems
confident that this is one initiative
which is here to stay.
the Rector. This seems somewhat
contradictory to the rather stern and
authoritarian e-mail sent via various
faculties some time after the offi-
cial announcement was made. One
student tells Felix, “Maybe passing
policies and then debating retro-
spectively is the Imperial College
way of doing things but common
sense tells us that isn’t particularly
fair or effective.” Understandably,
Sir Richard has been used to wear-
ing identification for the whole of his
corporate life, but when he starts
inflicting mandatory regulations
unseen in any other UK university,
he can expect unrest amongst the
student body.
Asked specifically about the wearing
of hoodies, scarves and ‘offensive’
dress, the Rector replies, “And what
we don’t want are people completely
covered. It’s nothing about hav-
ing a scarf, that’s just being ludi-
crous. Just as long as we’re all sen-
sible about it at the end of the day.”
Sensible isn’t the word of choice
from Kian Low, Welfare Campaigns
Officer, telling Felix, “The college
should not have the authority to
judge what is ‘offensive’. What may
be offensive to one person may not
be to another. If anything it should
be the student union that lays out
what is ‘offensive’, which can be
properly defined by the students
themselves.”

What Not To Wear! Imperial’s verision of Trinny and Susannah won’t like you wearing a scarf, hoodie or “offensive clothing” (left).
You could be escourted off campus if you don’t wear your swipe card around your neck (right). Imperial plc, here we come.
Imperial College have announced a
strict dress code for its students and
staff. Failure to comply could result
in students being “removed from
the College’s premises”.
The dress code states that “at all
times while on campus staff and stu-
dents must wear their College iden-
tity cards”. On top of this employees
and students are told to “refrain
from wearing clothing that obscures
the face such as a full or half veil,
hooded tops or scarves worn across
the face”. The rationale behind
this is that it will “maximise our
[College’s] chances of detecting the
presence of anyone who shouldn’t
be here”. According to Imperial, this
dress code has been implemented
“in light of security concerns raised
by the terrorist incidents which
occurred over the summer”.
The ruling appears to be quite
unenforceable as there are numer-
ous entrances to the College, and
there is a public right of way straight
through the middle of College along
Imperial College Road, connecting
Queens Gate to Exhibition Road.
It is clear that College also have
doubts about the enforceability of
the ruling. An Imperial spokesper-
son told Felix, “It’s not a question
of it being enforceable – rather it
is a question of College security.
We expect all students to take their
