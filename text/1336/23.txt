The Union &
Babar Ahmad
Dear Editor,
I was saddened to discover that the
union president has set policy to
support the campaign in support
of Babar Ahmed. For those of us
without strong sympathies toward
this person it seems an abuse of the
power of a president to set a policy
which is either redundant or poten-
tially offensive. Supporting a free
trial ought not to be a policy but a
principle upon which any political
body within the union should sup-
port, why then single out this spe-
cial interest and suggest unequivo-
cal support for Babar Ahmed? I
say unequivocally since the caption
on the front of last weeks felix
showed the campaign using the slo-
gan “FREE BABAR AHMED” why
not “FAIR TRIAL FOR BABAR
AHMED”?. Ought not the president
retract her support for this cam-
paign given its inflammatory and
heavily biased nature?
Why does the president not feel
a fair trial will be given in the US?
For those of us who realise that
a death penalty of Babar Ahmed
is not at all likely, a campaign to
prevent fair trial in the US rather
than to fair trial in the UK seems to
express merely an anti-american
sentiment, hardly a sentiment
which should be shared by the
president of an organisation which
ought to represent the americans
within the college.
This contrasts with the
neighbouring article on the front
page of Felix (ULU council chair
sent packing). Whilst we should
support the removal of a person
in a union body who seems to
have such homophobic tendencies
since he surely cannot be a fair
representative of the homosexual
members of that union, why should
the American members of our
union be represented by somenone
who possesses and acts upon anti-
american tendencies?
Ought not the President and
the council not hold an impartial
position toward political causes
within the Union? Would it be right
for the Union to allow Conservative
Society meetings but ban the
Liberals from meeting within its
buildings? The impartiality of our
Union is important given that
it ought to be representing all
cultures and political persuasions
within the university. Just as ULU
would not support homophobia
within its council we ought not
allow such clear anti-american
sentiment to fester in ours.

Dear Andrew,
I wanted to write to clarify a few
points made in your letter. The
policy that’s being discussed was
set by Union Council in December
2004(see www.union.ic.ac.uk/
council), and not by me as an indi-
vidual. Therefore I’m not abusing

Letter
The Bar Wench
Dear Editor,
At risk of taking “The Bar Wench”
more seriously than she deserves,
I must respond to the xenophobic,
hateful views expressed in “The
Wench Returns” in the Nightlife
section of Felix on 17 November,
2005.
On the surface the piece uses the
juvenile humour of the “Fat Slags”
variety; but it also exposes a trou-
bled ego that is threatened by those
who speak, dress, and interact
differently. Fear is, of course, the
mother of hatred. The opening com-
parison with vermin, meant jok-
ingly (of course), is as disturbing as
those insults levelled, with narrow-
minded persistence throughout our
shared history, against a range of
“outsiders” who seem to threaten
our way of life simply because they
are different (Jews, Irish, Punks,
Caribbeans, Muslims, Women,
Catholics, Welsh, Homosexuals,
Pakistanis, Scots, etc.)
Jokes are to be laughed at, but
to compare someone with a sexu-
ally-transmitted disease is to turn
a joke into a weapon of nationalist,
xenophobic destructiveness. The
reduction of a young woman to
“a pig in a girdle” puts “The Bar
Wench” on the same level as those
nationalists who dehumanize their
perceived enemy so as to justify
genocidal atrocities.
Only someone who is both obnox-
iously arrogant and extremely
insecure would set out to represent
her enemy -- “attractive, lovely”
American girls - as vermin, as
beasts, as a biological infection.
My hope, as an Englishman and
as a teacher, is that your readers
can see that “The Wench Returns”
says more about the vitriolic hatred
of “The Bar Wench” than it does
about the students who help pay
her rent, who help make ICU a
more interesting place, who are
here to learn about British culture
from the many students at ICU
whose minds are more open to dif-
ference than hers.

my position as President; it’s my
job to uphold the policy already
set by Council – and to represent
the views of Imperial students. As
I said to Felix last week – “Union
Council set policy to support
Babar having a fair trial in the UK
and it’s disappointing that after
our students’ efforts, which were
most prominent last year, it hasn’t
prevented the Home Secretary’s
decision. - the policy still stands,
so continues to be supported by
the Union.” .Though the policy was
set last academic year, Union poli-
cies do not lapse for 3 years unless
specifically revoked, therefore it
still holds (more information about
the governance and policies of the
Union can be found at www.union.
ic.ac.uk/resource).
Any policy is voted on by Union
Council before it can become
Union policy. Union Council has 50
members representing the different
parts of the Imperial student body.
Any student can attend Union
Council meetings to give their
views and feedback and therefore
if policy is set it represents the
views of a substantial number of
the student body.
For the Union or any individual
to oppose actions or policy deci-
sions of the current American
administration doesn’t equate to
being anti-American in anyway
whatsoever. Many Americans,
including American students, hold
a similar position to that of the
Union, and they are not of course
‘anti-American’ for doing so. Had
the policy been seen to be anti-
American, then it wouldn’t have
passed as it would have breached
the Union’s Equal Opp’s Policy.
The reasoning behind the policy
was not anti-American, but that
Babar, as a British Citizen, should
have his trial in Britain and not
elsewhere.
As President, my role is to rep-
resent ALL students regardless of
race, religion, nationality or any-
thing else and students should not
see this policy as anti-American,
by me nor by the Union as a whole
– the Union represents all cultures
and all students and any prejudice
against any part of the Imperial
community will not be tolerated
or supported by the Union. The
Union is apolitical and deals with
issues affecting students as stu-
dents. However as Babar was a
former student of this College and
the policy also addresses the wider
issues of civil liberties, the policy
was passed by Union Council.
I Hope this clears things up.

ICU President

Sarah Khatib on
Luca Manfredi
So why did I abstain after all?
Council Chairs are not expected to
have no views at all; rather, they
are expected not to show any in
their role.
I believe Luca Manfredi’s com-
ments were violent and homopho-
bic; and posting them on a public
website demonstrates bad conduct.
However, these comments were not
made when he was in office.
We cannot look back at each indi-
vidual officer’s past and rule them
out because of what they had said
however long ago it was before they
were in office. Where do we draw
the line? At one, five, ten years?
By abstaining, I was not condon-
ing his actions and did not “sit back
and plead impartiality”. I made a
clear statement against the motion,
which was setting a precedent that
I felt was unacceptable.
We are still students, we make
mistakes, we repent, we apologise
and we grow; Manfredi had the
chance to apologise and prove him-
self at the most recent ULU Council
meeting.
I could not vote against the
motion because the statements
Manfredi put forward in defence of
himself were inadequate and por-
trayed an incompetency as Council
Chair but at the same time, I could
not vote in favour because I believe
that it would set an inappropriate
precedent. I expressed these views
by abstaining.

Rethink Rubbish
Dear Felix,
I fully agree with Andrew
McConville’s article “Rethink
Rubbish: Reuse and Recycle”: recy-
cling is a vital issue for Imperial
College to tackle. I would say that
the change in attitude that Andrew
speaks of is a matter of appreciat-
ing that recycling is not about mak-
ing environmentalists happy but
is simply the most intelligent and
efficient thing to do.
This shift in attitude is underway
across European countries, busi-
nesses and communities, and
indeed here at Imperial College.
For example, my fellow students
in the Department of Electrical &
Electronic Engineering (which,
let’s face it, can hardly be accused
of being environmental) have been
questioning the limited recycling
facilities and the fact that paper
is simply thrown away. They have
done so not because they like trees,
but because they are engineers
– good engineers – and object to
wasteful and unintelligent solu-
tions.
As an Imperial student, I would
obviously like to think that Imperial
is a champion of intelligent solu-
tions. Yet, as Andrew mentions,
Cambridge and Oxford are ahead
of us in terms of sustainability
measures. Even the LSE has clever
energy-efficiency lighting control
technology in their library.)
Let’s bring Imperial’s waste man-
agement into the 21st century with
a well-functioning recycling system.

Dear Felix,
Farewell to page 2. Picture this:
little me sitting on the train on my
way home from university, quite
smugly pulling out the latest copy
of Felix which I’d hidden under my
arm. My secret weapon!! Any Tom,
Dick or Harry could get a copy of
The Guardian, but me? Oh no, I
was a member of the elite. I had
my Felix. With it’s intelligent layout
and flawless design, my Felix was
bound to beat the other literary
materials scattered around the
train carriage in the hands of Mr
Banker and Ms French Tourist.
As I opened my beloved Felix,
I could sense that my friend
from across the channel was not
impressed. The intelligent content
and flawless design had also failed
to register with self important
banker whose icy stares I could feel
raising the hairs on the back of my
neck.
When I eventually dropped my
smug gaze to the paper in my
hands, I found to my utter amaze-
ment, not one, not two, but three
pale forms splayed across the origi-
nally entitled page 3. Just where
did they come up with a name like
that?
For a second I thought I’d picked
up the wrong paper. But no, when I
glanced back at the front page the
word ‘felix’ stared back at me.
Is the world going mad? Evidently
so. Am I the only one outraged by
the rather strange attempts at inde-
cent exposure by our peers? Again,
evidently so!
My eyes have been scarred but
others out there can still be saved.
Let us stop this degradation of our
swanky high calibre paper. If you’re
really desperate for some naked
science then head down to the
Science Museum during your lunch
break. I personally will be gluing
pages 2 and 3 together in order to
save my eyes and mind from fur-
ther pollution.

Rupert Neate, Felix Editor,
replies:
Dear Alea,
Do you not like the concept or was
it just those 3 “pale forms”?
Alea El-damanawi, respones:
Dear Rupert,
Technically it’s more the concept,
I’ve seen many a girl look away in
horror this week. I don’t think guys
mind it as much but then again
their eye candy seems to be of a
better quality then what the ladies
get.
Rupert Neate:
I hope you don’t say that when I
pose for the last issue of year.
Alea El-damanawi:
Your intending to pose? My my, I’ll
get the word out, better print some
extra copies of felix when u do!
You should do it sitting on a picca-
dilly line train reading a copy of the
felix and put it next to my letter...
