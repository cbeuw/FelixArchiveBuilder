h my god this issue is so green. SO
GREEN I TELL YOU. Just reading it
will make you healthier and add at
least one year to your sad, Imperial-
stunted life. You might wonder why.
You might even vocally ask me on the
off chance you spot me outdoors “why are you doing
a Green Issue Lef? Caring about the environment is so
2001.”
And the truth is I feel you. As a former starry eyed
biologist who wanted to work in conservation and
legitimately tried to work on schemes that were
fighting to save the rhino, I look at myself today and
almost feel a bit sad. My dinner last night generated
enough plastic waste to kill a small family of sea turtles
(of course I know there’s no such thing as a family of
sea turtles, sea turtles live solitary lives, you can take
the biologist out of the field but you can’t take away
all the countless hours I’ve spent watching natural
history documentaries). My household orders toilet
paper from Amazon. And I’ve eaten so much sushi this
year I feel personally responsible for the decimation of
global tuna stocks.
But as I said, I almost feel sad. Because caring for
the environment is hard, demoralising and draining.
Regardless of whether it’s true or not, you soon accept
that using eco-friendly products is inconvenient, turning
all the lights off is hard and caring for bees is pointless.
Looking in the mirror to find that you’ve become one
of ‘them’ is a bizarre experience. Part of you wants to
say “Snap out of it!” but all that comes out is “Meh”.
Still when Environmental Soc came up to me and
said they were doing a Green Week and they were
wondering if we could work on some content in
anticipation, my tiny, oil-smothered heart skirted
and once again we went all out. So once again we
got a good deal of people legitimately caring and
contributing their thoughts and advice, and it’s been
nice (and surprising) to see some environmental
consciousness protrude from this pile of corporate
sponsorship we call Imperial College.
So read on and try not to dwell on the hypocrisy of
trying to be green while printing 80,000 pages worth
of questionable content.
