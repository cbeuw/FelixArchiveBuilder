No mascotry resolution in sight
Why bother with reforms if nobody cares?
Matt Johnston
question the need for mascotry
discussion. Simran Kukran, a
welfare representative for the
RSMU, argued that no one
cares and council should be a
place to discuss more pressing
issues. The RSMU president
also questioned the point of
creating rules to regulate an
activity that only a handful
of students participate in. The
disagreement between CUs
prompted DPCS, James Cowx
to ask the CU presidents to
talk it out before bouncing
the paper for a second time.
Looks like the mascotry paper
lives to die another day.
T
he age-old Imperial
tradition of mascot
stealing(alsoknown
as mascotry) was
once again brought
up at Union Council
on Monday, in an attempt to
create a new, contemporary
set of rules to regulate the
competitive ‘sport’.
Mascotry involves the theft
of the various antique items
that each of the constituent
unions (CUs) possesses i.e.
their mascots. The mascots
go from ‘violate’ to ‘inviolate’
depending on whether their
theft is permitted or not.
The mascots come in all
shapes and sizes and include
Bolt (a 68lb wheel nut), its
sibling Spanner (a 64lb brass
spanner manufactured to fit
the bolts on Tower Bridge
perfectly), Davy (a three-
foot high, 132lb brass and
aluminium mining lamp),
Theta (a seven-foot long steel
thermometer which according
to the RCSU costs £ 10,000),
and Phoenix (a six foot tall
bird suit). These are the crown
jewels of CGCU, RSMU, RCSU,
and ICSMU respectively.
The paper was a follow-
up to one presented in
November by Andrew Olson
(Council Ordinary Member,
Undergraduate Faculty of
Engineering), in which it was
proposed to make all mascots
inviolate (i.e. unstealable).
The paper was rejected but
Council agreed to reevaluate
the existing rules at a future
point.
Therevisedpaperarguedthat
the current rules are outdated
and that the vagueness has
caused disagreements (with
CU members reportedly
getting roughed up by rival
CU members) in the past.
The original 1999 rule book
has only been signed by
CGCU and RCSU, leaving it
ambiguous as to the rules that
RSMU/ICSMU ‘play’ by.
The proposed rules redefine
what counts as a mascot,
what counts as a steal and the
protocol for demands after a
steal. The ICU President is also
to be the nominated ‘referee’
who will preside over all
disputes. But the key changes
concern safety and suggest
measures to prevent injury
and damage to mascots and
College Property.
Mascotry has a long history,
especially between CGCU,
RSMU and RCSU (ICSMU’s
Phoenix wasn’t around until
2009), and tales of cunning
stunts can be found littered
throughout past issues of
felix. Raids involving fire
extinguishers, hordes of
students, and car chases
down Exhibition Road have
occurred in the past so a few
rules could help prevent it all
from getting out of hand.
But the presentation of the
paper saw many students
King’s Fossil Free leads to student arrest
A
nyone that’s
been around
Imperial a
while will
remember the
Fossil Free
Campaign posters that went
up during first term a few
years ago. These declared
“Imperial’s getting coal for
Christmas” as part of a larger
campaign to try and get
Imperial to divest from fossil
fuels. Whilst the Imperial
group for this movement has
become slightly quieter on
campus lately, the national
movement is going strong.
Last week over forty students
decorated the front of King’s
College London with balloons,
flowers and poster paint
dots in part of a gradually
escalating campaign of action
with the aim of getting King’s
College London to divest from
Fossil fuels.
The poster paint dots relate
back to action from the last
week of Autumn term when
students sprayed 1000 chalk
dots around the internal walls
of King’s College to represent
the need to ‘connect the dots’
on climate change. The point
the campaign was trying
to make, was the need for
looking beyond polar bears
and realising that the 2ºC
temperatures limit that’s on
track to be exceeded in a
matter of years, will lead to an
exponential increase in forest
fires, floods, droughts, storms
and sea levels.
At the start of this term, Roger
Hallam, a PhD candidate in the
Department of Culture Media
and Creative Industries, spray

\\ Raids involving

painted “Divest from Oil and
Gas Now – Out of Time” on
the front of King’s. Then later
in this term ten students and
alumni spray painted the
Main Entrance Hall of the
College leading to the first
arrests in decades of King’s
College students during a
political protest. Roger Hallam
(student) and David Rhys Alan
(alumni) were detained for 14
hours before being released
without charges at 3am. Roger
has since been suspended and
David banned from College
property.
A King’s student, Luke
Harwood, has said the
following: “The fact that
institutions such as KCL are
content to happily risk the fate
of humanity for a profitable
investment is beyond
contemptible. When they
seem so obviously unwilling
to divest the only option is to
escalate our message.”
King’s College seem to have
at least started a dialogue and
time will tell about how far
these actions will go before a
resolution is reached.
With Green Week coming
up this seems an ideal time to
reignite efforts for divestment
at Imperial.
