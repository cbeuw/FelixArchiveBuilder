ceilings blocking off the top
of the career. While the film
might revel in its celebration
of 1978 – Talking Heads had
just released their first album,
Times Square was still dirty,
and the hardcore punk scene
was emerging in Southern
California – Jamie and Doro-
thea are both characters who
are unmoored to a particular
time, trapped between eras.
Mills’ directorial style is
divisive, marked by his com-
plex collaging of words and
images; the use of voiceo-
ver recurs throughout the
film, moving forwards and
backwards through time, the
epitome of an omniscience
narrator. At certain points this
is used for devastating effect,
such as when Dorothea tells
us she will die before the
new millennium, from cancer
caused by the cigarettes
ever-present in her hands; but
at other times the use of stock
images and pictures can have
a more distancing effect, and
can easily seem twee.
Still, Mills’ greatest achieve-
ment with 20th
Century
Women, aside from the beau-
tiful screenplay, is the room
he gives his actors to reach
inside themselves and deliver
top performances. Bening
is exceptional as Dorothea,
alternating from motherly
love to stone-cold wit, and
always in complete control of
her body language. Gerwig
delivers possibly a career-
best performance, allowing
her Abbie to plumb emotional
depths that usually eschew
her in the kooky roles into
which she is typecast; Fanning
similarly is cast against type,
her innocent image playing
off against her secret life
of smoking and sleeping
around.
Last year, Mills said in an
interview that “It felt like I was
raised by my mom and sisters,
so I was always appealing to
women in the punk scene or
women in my world. I always
leaned to them to figure out
my life as a straight white
guy. So I wanted to make
a movie about that.” 20th
Century Women is a fitting
tribute. A tribute to a par-
ticular time, and a particular
place, but above all a tribute
to the funny, beautiful, tender
women who raised him.
Fred Fyles
be described as intimate, but
Mills never lets us forget that
a seismic cultural shift is on
the horizon: Reagan, the War
on Drugs, Y2K. This bigger
picture spills over into the
characters’ lives most obvi-
ously towards the end of the
film, when a group of them sit
down in Dorothea’s house to
watch Jimmy Carter’s ‘Crisis
of Confidence’ speech. Dor-
othea declares it “beautiful”,
but another character says
“it’s all over for him”. The
other character is right: two
short years after the speech
Reagan will enter the White
House, signalling the end of
Mills’ carefree vision.
Just as with Beginners –
which centred around the
relationship between Oliver
and his father Hal, who came
out as gay in his mid-70s, fol-
lowing the death of Oliver’s
mother – 20th
Century Women
examines the distance that is
established between parents
and children. Bening’s Doro-
thea is a cipher: at one point
Jamie asks her “do you think
you’re happy?”, to which she
responds “seriously, you don’t
just ask people questions like
that. Especially your mom.”
In another scene, after being
lent feminist literature by
Abbie, Jamie reads aloud a
passage of Zoe Moss’ It Hurts
to be Alive and Obsolete:
The Ageing Woman: “I am
gregarious, interested in
others, and I think intelligent.”
Jamie quotes, “All I ask is to
get to know people and to
have them interested in know-
ing me”. Dorothea, visibly
angered by this display, cuts
Jamie down: “I don’t need to
read a book to know about
me.”
Just as Abbie and Jamie
are trapped between eras –
in the long stretch from the
death of JFK that signalled the
end of the American dream,
and the rise of Reagan that
signalled a new dream, for
some and not all – Dorothea
is caught at a turning point in
the 20th
century: old enough
to be admitted to flight
school, but too young to have
been able to pilot in WWII;
born late enough to trailblaze
a way into being the first
draftsperson in the company,
but too early to break
through the residual glass

A
s part of the
promotional
material for
20th
Century
Women,
director Mike
Mills’ latest work, there’s a
website called ‘My Mother
Before Me’, where users
can upload pictures of what
their mother looked like
before they had children. The
shots, which are hazy and
saturated, each come with
a brief description from the
child of what their mother
was like; what is noticeable,
however, is how superficial
these descriptors are. They all
seem to center around what
the mothers did, or how many
children they had, or how
they looked – few delve into
the emotional life of a mother.
It is this disconnect, between
the thoughts and feelings
of parents and children,
that Mills explores in 20th
Century Women. Like his last
film, Beginners, 20th
Century
Women was created with
material mined from Mills’
own childhood; it is no sur-
prise, then, that he described
the film as “a collective por-
trait of the women who raised
us”. Taking on the mantle of
his mother is Annette Bening,
who plays Dorothea Fields,
a draftsperson born into the
Depression, who had one
child late in life, and has
since divorced her husband;
rattling around in a mansion
on the Californian coast,
Dorothea and her son, Jamie
(Lucas Jade Zumann), form
the emotional core of the film.
Attached to them are a vari-
ety of lodgers and friends:
Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a
young punk who escaped
the West Coast for New
York and art school, only to
return following a diagnosis
of cervical cancer; William
(Billy Crudup), a mechanic
and handyman who fixes up
the house in exchange for
rent; and Julie (Elle Fanning),
Jamie’s best friend whose
psychiatrist mother forces her
to attend group therapy.
At the beginning of the film,
Dorothea, fearing that Jamie
is slipping away from her,
enlists Abbie and Julie to help
raise him into a good man.
This forms the key nucleus of
the drama, which could best
Mike Mills’ love letter to the women
that raised him has its flaws, but
its uncanny evocation of shared
nostalgia, and exceptional acting
talent, make it a heartfelt piece
of emotional cinematic drama
