I
have two minor claims to
fame: my brother featured
in a Gocompare advert
alongside Stuart Pearce
and I learnt to swim in the
same pool as Anthony
Head’s children. Pretty
impressive right? No, I know,
but it means I have always
seen swimming as an epic,
almost vampire-slaying-esque
activity. And I’ve never really
been any good at it. So when
I was handed the opportunity
to try a sport I’ve never
played, hockey, and take it to
the pool, I was apprehensive.
Underwater hockey, or
Octopush, does exactly what
it says on the tin. Hockey,
with sticks and all, played in
your local lido. Two teams of
six aim to push a weighted
puck into the opponent’s goal
(the construction of which
resembled the underwater
equivalent of sticking jumpers
down as goal posts). The
sticks are essentially short-
ened versions of their land
cousins. Breathing, which I
learnt rather quickly involves
drinking half the pool, is
tricky: requiring a technique
by which you dive down with
a deep breath and surface
with a tip of the head and
an almighty cough to empty
out the snorkel tube. Being a
strong swimmer helps, but it’s
also an advantage to have
a good element of flexibility.
was provided in the form of
flippers and a snorkel. Once
again, Imperial clubs are
providing free equipment
for those unable to purchase
kit themselves. Underwater
hockey is no exception, giving
me a range of sizes to ensure
I could compete comfortably.
Once in the water, I’m given
clear and concise instruc-
tions as to how to breathe
properly. Having tried it
and resembled a fish out of
between team mates. The
knack is to wait for the person
two turns in front before
diving down, ready to receive
the puck. This technique is piv-
otal during a game: dive too
soon and you’ll run out of air,
too late and your opponent
swims under you like a scene
taken straight from Jaws.
The scuba team kindly took
some snaps of me trying this:
typically, they only caught my
poorer attempts otherwise
I would like to say that my
ability to puck-push closely
resembled that of a graceful
mermaid, but only to the
extent that it was completely
fictional. Fortunately, the
members were very support-
ive, giving me hints and tips
on how to improve. Similar to
many clubs I’ve visited, every-
one is very welcoming and
driven to improve your ability
and not just their own.
As I had to leave early, we
were put straight into a mini
game. Now, normally by this
point in a session I’ve got the
basics down and can join in
as much as possible. Unfortu-
nately, I wasn’t just trying to
find my feet but also my lungs,
so to say I was playing would
be generous. I did, however,
get a good idea of how
the sport is played and the
manoeuvres required in order
to be triumphant. Players start
at either end of the pool and
rush to the puck which has
been placed in the centre,
similarly to dodgeball. You
nominate someone to rush
forward and the rest swim
towards the other team. What
follows closely resembles a
controlled piranha feast, with
less blood and more stick
swiping. Players will attempt
to move the puck through the
pool but passing before your
lungs scream for air. A cul-
mination of strong swimming
technique and puck control is
essential, but it’s not a sport
to be avoided purely due to
poor ability. Similar to many
of the more unusual sports it’s
severely under-represented,
but provides an opportunity
to be a stronger swimmer and
team player. I urge you to
at least go online and watch
some being played, then
subsequently attend training
on Thursday nights as you will
like what you see.
The only downside I can
think of is that I couldn’t wear
my usual Birmingham City
shirt.
water, we move onto some
simple breathing drills along
the length of the pool. We
would swim a section of the
pool along the floor then the
remainder along the surface.
This helped train newcomers
on the different positions
required when playing. It was
explained to me that players
usually float near the surface
when not in play, then quickly
dive down in order to get
involved.
As you can see, the club
have designed exercises
which aptly address this most
basic of skills. It shows the
sign of a good team when
they start with the basics,
even for those who are a
dab hand. There are a few
newbies in the session with
me, and they are treated
with great care as expected
in a sport which is poten-
tially dangerous for weaker
swimmers. However, let’s not
try and sugar coat it here, I
wasn’t exactly flying up and
down the pool. More like
confidently diving down a
few centimetres due to an
increased… let’s say buoy-
ancy… around the midriff.
But I certainly tried and it
has definitely convinced me
to spend more time in my
speedos, much to my wife’s
dismay.
Next up, puck exercises.
We split into two teams and

S
till buzzing after
their triumph last
week, Imperial
were roaring
to get at a UCL
Medical School
(RUMS) side which had
evaded defeat in the past five
meetings, including a 49-10
drubbing earlier this season.
With RUMS 2nd
top and IC 2nd
from bottom in our league,
the scene was set for a tough
afternoon.
Returning absentees, includ-
ing skipper Joe McGrail,
gave the home side a steely
edge as Imperial looked to
put their foot down early. A
series of hard carries (particu-
larly from Moorby and CPS in
the centres) took IC deep into
RUMS territory, and when
the visitors infringed trying
to stem the tide, Price Smith
stepped up and continued
his unusual recent trend of
converting penalties, to give
Imperial the lead. Not satis-
fied with this, IC came hard
at RUMS again. A dazzling
run, with some spellbinding
footwork, from stage one
Billy, got RUMS back ped-
dling again. Field moved the
ball quickly out wide to Zab-
oronksy, who drove over the
line to score, with CPS adding
the extras.
RUMS finally started to
get a bit of a foothold in the
game. A few of their big
forwards worked out that it
was possible to make yards,
if only they don’t run at DNS.
Their number eight instead
ran at Clayton and put an
end to what had been a busy
20 minutes from the flanker,
by pretty much knocking him
out and leaving a sizeable
egg on his head (not yet
known if either the egg or
the dazed Clayton has been
re-poached). Thankfully Curtis
was on hand to slot in, but
the disruption suited RUMS
who got back into the game.
Firstly with a neatly taken
drop goal, then a converted
try, with nice footwork taking
their big second row past
some tired looking defence
to leave the half time score at
10-10.
IC came out guns blazing
after the break, their set piece
dominance giving them a
great platform to build off. In
his 14th
carry of 2017, Matt
Blackett chalked up his first
metre made which happily
got him over the line. Zab-
oronsky added his second
try, utilising a powerful fend

I
t has been only two
weeks since the
Immortals fell victim
to the Cambridge
Pythons. With a lapse
of concentration (from
a heavily fatigued Defence)
the score was 6-0 for Pythons
when the bell did toll. The
loss was particularly painful
due to the honest fact we
are the better team, and on
that day it was insufficient
preparation that ultimately let
us down.
The day began cold, made
all the worse when Markus
‘Where’s your bus?’ Mohr
found out the minibus we
had booked was missing.
Despite this, we got to the
fortress of Harlington ready
to defend it against the then
undefeated Pythons. We
too are undefeated but only
at home; needless to say,
both team had streaks we
wanted to keep. Immortals
started strong and maintained
momentum for the whole
game. Our star quarterback,
linebacker, kicker and punter
Jason ‘Captain America’
Patrick Kuilan scored four
touchdowns on offence, and
flew around making massive
hits on defence. All his plays
earned him the title of overall
MVP for the day, although
his full value is impossible to
express in words or awards
alone. As well as scoring on
offence we also scored on
defence when Henners ‘one

excellent work from subs Will
Carter and Curtis. Carter got
involved again with a second
lung-bursting break up the
middle. The offload didn’t
quite go to hand, but instead
fell to Miller, who for once
was working hard in support.
Some good footwork from the
prop controlled the ball and
got him over the line, to seal
a 29-13 bonus point victory
for Imperial. Special mention
goes to the subs bench, who
came on and bolstered a
tiring team and steered the
ship home.

MVP) slithered through the
Pythons O-line, knocking
over their Quarterback onto
his lard-ass, and recovering
the ball in the endzone for a
touchdown. His blocking on
offence allowed for the devas-
tating ground game to have
full effect. Nigvi ‘Beast-mode’
Tam was awarded Offensive
MVP, for his consistent plays,
great blocks and elusive ‘like
a mouse’ style of running.
The touchdowns were often
followed by Jorge ‘HHHhh-
hhhimmortals’ Ales (Rookie
Offensive MVP) firing into
the end zone to secure the
two point conversions. On
defence we were as con-
sistent as always. With the

Shout-out to my main-man-tri-

ing the snakes and ensuring
the shutout. He was awarded
Rookie Defensive MVP.
A total of five touchdowns
were scored on Cambridge
with four successful conver-
sions. The final score was a
massive 46-0. Embarrassing,
that is what you get when you
try and desecrate Immortal
ground #OurRunway.
