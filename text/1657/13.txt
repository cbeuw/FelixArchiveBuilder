Revolution:
Russian Art
1917 – 1932 | A
terrible festival
of dead leaves
T
he Royal Academy’s
ambitious new
exhibition
chronicles a
troubled period
in Russian history,
from the overthrowing of
the tsarist regime in 1917,
through the years of civil
war, to the consolidation of
power by Stalin after death.
In this window of time, art in
Russia experienced a brief
burgeoning that was soon
to be violently truncated.
A major exhibition of post-
revolution artists took place in
Leningrad in 1932 – this was
to be a last gasp of creativity
before the suppression
of “formalism” and the
persecution of artists by
Stalin.
Rather than artistic merit
alone, the selected works
illustrate the upheaval
and changing mood of the
times. A range of media is
included – not just paintings,
but also film, photography
and all manner of parapher-
nalia: posters, “agitational
porcelain” decorated with
communist symbols, banners,
and textiles. Artworks are
not viewed as standalone
pieces, but placed firmly in
the original context in which
they were created. Beginning
with glorified portraits of
Lenin and ending with Stalin’s
politically correct socialist
realism, the exhibition
leads us through 11
rooms and over
200 artworks,
many of which
have never
been exhib-
ited in the UK
before.
A great
clash of
ideas is on
display.
Rooms of
propagan-
dist work,
staunchly pro-
moting Bolshevik
ideals, contrast
sharply with the
abstract modernism of
the Russian avant-garde.
The futuristic, new-age
depictions of machinery and
industrialization, such as
Aleksandr Deyneka’s Textile
Workers and Arkady Shaik-
het's Komsomol at the Wheel,
are juxtaposed against nostal-
gic images of the birch forests
and provincial life in pre-rev-
olution Russia. In the room
‘Fate of the Peasants’, utopian
visions of collectivised farm-
ing and golden harvests strike
a dissonant chord against
Kazimir Malevich’s faceless
peasants, and the mistrustful
eyes of Boris Grigoriev’s Old
Dairy Woman.
‘Brave New World’ is a
large room celebrating the
explosion of artistic ideas
in the years immediately
following 1917. Many artists
were initially optimistic about
the revolution, viewing it as a
chance to develop new styles
of art for a modern Russia.
Experimental styles and
novel ways of looking at art
proliferated; among them are
the movements of Suprema-
tism and Constructivism. On
display are a range of works
from some of the most impor-
tant artists of the period,
including Wassily Kandin-
sky, Lyubov Popova, Marc
Chagall, and El Lissitzky.

Bolshevik, Boris Mikailovich Kustodiev,

Camera is shown elsewhere
in the exhibition, while the
Suprematist painter Malevich
has a room to himself.
Indeed, two rooms are
dedicated to artists who were
invited to showcase their
work at the 1932 Leningrad
exhibition: Malevich’s room
is an almost exact recrea-
tion, displaying his reductive
Suprematist works such as
Black Square alongside more
representational art created
under Soviet pressure. The
blank faces of the people in
his paintings evoke the loss
of identity and an uncertain
future in the post-revolution
period. The second room,
dedicated to the artist Kuzma
Petrov-Vodkin, is interesting,
but rather less impressive.
A slightly ominous air hangs
over the exhibition. Despite
the determinedly cheerful
portrayals of heroic workers
and the stoically solemn faces
of the great leaders, there is
a vague sense that they are
all marching towards certain
doom. This is emphasised
by little details (a kerchief
of Lenin with Trotsky’s face
carefully cut out from one
corner) and more obvious
signs, such as the artwork
of ration cards and wartime
posters. Even the exuberance
of the avant-garde is undercut
by knowledge of the dreadful
fates that lay in store for both
the artists and the subjects
of their paintings – from
Anna Akhmatova to
Vsevolod Meyer-
hold, few of them
escaped the
coming purges
unscathed.
In a high,
domed room
off to one side,
a reconstruc-
tion of one of
Vladimir Tatlin’s
delicate “flying
machines” spins
lazily in endless
circles. Visually
stunning, it seems a
symbol of the grand
aspirations of the era
which ultimately never took
off the ground.

L
ogistically alone,
the new David
Hockney exhibition
at Tate Britain is a
marvel. Nearly 150
pieces spanning
the breadth of Hockney’s
career – paintings, sketches,
photography, video, and
drawings – have been
assembled in a thirteen-room
experience. Many of the
pieces have been borrowed
from David Hockney Inc., or
are owned by the Tate itself,
but an extraordinary number
have been sourced from other
art museums – V&A, MoMA,
The Metropolitan Museum
of Art, Smithsonian, Ludwig
Museum etc. – and at least
only under the gaze of a real
human eye. No matter how
long you stare at the images
online, Hockney’s art, as with
all great art, can only be fully
appreciated in the flesh.
For a Hockney aficionado,
however, much magic in this
exhibition lies in the smaller
works – sketches, drafts,
ideas – that find their soul
lurking in later masterpieces.
The sixth room, ‘Closer
Looking’ contains a multitude
of such pieces from 1960
– 1999. Here, one can see
the beginnings of Savings
and Loans Building (1967)
in the 1966 drawing Place
des Canons, Beirut (1966)
and the unmistakable style
of Centre-Jour in the French
Style (1974), in Window,
Grand Hotel, Vittel (1970).
The room also contains this
reviewer’s favourite find in
the exhibition: The Great
Pyramid with Palm Tree and
Car (1963) – a piece of
triangular graph paper, on
which the artist has sketched
a crude tree and car – which
itself serves as the draft for
Great Pyramid at Giza with
Broken Head from Thebes
(1963). Sadly, the latter does
not make an appearance at
the Tate, although it did pass
through Christie’s in 2013 for
£3.5m.
While the evolution of
Hockney’s method is evident
throughout, so too – though
more subtly – is his retention
of stylistic elements, themes,
and muses. Long winding
roads and rapid perspective
shifts between the foreground
and background are used
continuously from Arizona
(1964) to Going Up to Gar-
rowby Hill (2000). And of the
recurring characters in the
works, Hockney’s mother and
Paul Kasmin – the art dealer
who discovered a young
David in the sixties – share
the good fortune of being
depicted in both painting and
photography.
One may be forgiven for
assuming the real meat of
the exhibit lies in the middle
rooms, but given both
Hockney’s proficiency and
creativity right up to present
– the most recent works here
were completed just last year
– this is far from the case. The
Adam Gellatly
David Hockney is on at the Tate
Modern until 29th
May.

final room in the exhibition
showcases the artist’s recent
iPad drawings. Here, backlit
screens display not only the
final product but also the
evolution of the drawings
in the form of screen-cap-
tured videos. The audience
has the rare chance to see
Hockney’s – or any artist’s
for that matter – mind in
action. On the iPad, Hockney
repeatedly adds layer upon
layer of different shades to
transform the often-harsh
digital palette into something
far more agreeable to the
eye. On larger works, he
constantly jumps across the
workspace; adding small

details to a hand, followed by
a change in lighting to a jug,
and then back to the hand.
And most interestingly of all
he never erases, never clicks
‘undo’. If the structure of an
object no longer works, it is
simply drawn over and buried
beneath the new layer.
Few would question
Hockney’s reputation as one
of the most important and
influential British artists of
the last half-century. In many
ways, then, this exhibition
serves more as a reaffirma-
tion of the fact, as opposed
to the revelation of it. What is
revealed to large audiences
for the first time, however,
is not only Hockney’s will-
ingness to embrace new
mediums and styles but to
harness and mould them in
such a way that they become
as quintessentially ‘Hockney’
as his paintings from the sev-
enties. And he’s still doing it.
And he’s nearly 80. And it’s
brilliant.

The exhibition moves chron-
ologically through Hockney’s
career, with each of the rooms
highlighting a significantly
different period in the artist’s
work. Many of Hockney’s
most famous works are on
display – A Bigger Splash
(1967), American Collectors
(1968), Mr and Mrs Clark
and Percy (1970-1), Pearblos-
som Hwy. (1986) – images
so embedded in 20th
Century
art history one does not
expect to uncover any new
details. It comes as somewhat
of a surprise then when, for
example, the background

under the exhibition lights: a
