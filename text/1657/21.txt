When Marc Jacobs said that clothes mean nothing until someone lives in them, he probably
wasn’t thinking of all the clothes that end up in the Great Pacific garbage patch or the carbon
emissions the industry is responsible for. Eloise Hunt talks about the need for sustainability and
discusses ways to mitigate our passion for fashion.
A
t the thought
of pollution,
we imagine
raw sewage
pumped into
rivers, open-
caste mines and oil spills.
We don’t often think of our
fluffy unicorn slippers or plaid
shirts. But the overall impact
the fashion industry has on
our planet is shocking. The
production of clothing has
been estimated to account
for 10% of total carbon
impact. The fashion industry is
arguably the second greatest
fuel is guzzled transporting
clothes. But, we do know that
in the US only 2% of clothing
is domestically produced and
globally 90% of fabrics are
transported by cargo ship.
A single ship can produce as
much atmospheric pollution
as 50 million cars in just one
year.
Another major factor is
cheap synthetic fibres increas-
ingly replacing natural cotton
or wool. Polyester and nylon
are both non-biodegrada-
ble, energy intensive, and
made from petrochemicals.
Polyester is rapidly increasing
in value and is now in over
half of all clothing. Nylon is
absorbent and breathable,
so perfect for making those
super cute yoga pants. But
nylon production forms
nitrous oxide, a greenhouse
gas 310 times stronger than
carbon dioxide (not so cute).
Viscose is another synthetic
which is derived from wood
pulp, and the material’s pop-
ularity in fashion has caused
deforestation in Brazil and
Indonesia. This is significant
as the rainforest is often
described as the ‘lungs of the
earth’ – acting as our most
effective carbon sink and pro-
viding oxygen in return.
Even when stepping away
from synthetics, cotton
is hardly innocent. It is
incredibly water intensive
accounting for 2.6% of global
water use. It takes 2,000
litres of water to produce the
average cotton t-shirt. Further,
99.3% of cotton growth uses
fertilizers, which can cause
runoff and eutrophication
of waterways. Uzbekistan,
the sixth largest producer
The final environmental
issue with fashion is the
overwhelming garment greed
driving consumption. The
western world hunts down a
sale as our ancestors chased
prey in the wilderness. High
demand produces 150 billion
items of clothing annually,
which globally equates to 20
new items per person every
year. Then, on average each
garment is worn only seven
times before being dumped
in a landfill. Worse still, in the
UK alone £37.5 billion worth
Increasingly, high-end design-
ers are turning eco fashion
from hippy to haute with
endorsements from celebri-
ties, including Mark Ruffalo,
Emma Watson and Stella
McCartney. This is a small yet
significant thread of hope.
But what can us mere stu-
dents do when we don’t have
thousands to splurge on a
tee? I’ll spare you the lecture
on conscious consumerism
as it’s clear that we need to
loose our societal obsession
with buying the latest catwalk
trend and wear our clothes
for longer. But, when you
need new clothes, opting
for Fair Trade or organic
fabrics is a simple way to
ease pesticide pollution and,
in the case of cotton, reduce
water consumption by 60%. If
your heart still throbs for high
street style, then look to the
H&M Conscious line which
uses sustainably sourced or
recycled materials. Or, better
yet choose second hand,
vintage or upcycled items to
save your pennies and the
planet from the processing of
more virgin fibres.
In celebration of Green
Week, Environmental Society
are holding a clothing and
items swap at 13:00-16:00
in Metric on Wednesday the
22nd
February – this is a per-
fect opportunity to rejuvenate
your wardrobe with sustaina-
ble style. Above all, fashion
is not yet sustainable but we,
as consumers, hold enormous
power to persuade brands to
make products that are clean,
of high-quality, and worth
wearing.
polluter in the world, second
only to oil. Even ignoring
the human rights abuses and
animal suffering, the impact
of our disposable dress is
dire. People need to be taking
fashion more seriously, not
less.
The lack of sustainability in
fashion can be blamed on
four major factors. Firstly,
there is enormous energy
consumption associated with
clothing. Production is con-
centrated in countries such as
Bangladesh and China. Here,
factories are powered by
coal plants before garments
are shipped to the rest of the
world. It is difficult to find
reliable data on how much
of clothing is hidden in our
closets unused and unloved.
Faced with issues of energy
consumption, the rise of
synthetics, water consump-
tion, and fast fashion it’s
easy to feel powerless.
But, with increased scrutiny
comes sustainable solutions.
of cotton in the world, is the
poster boy of cotton catastro-
phe. In the 1950s, two rivers
were diverted from the Aral
Sea as a source of irrigation
for cotton production. As the
sea dried up, it also became
over-salinated and laden with
pesticides and fertilizer from
agricultural runoff. Contami-
nated dust from the bare, dry
lake-bed saturated the air,
creating a public health crisis
and settling onto farmland.
This also has the knock-down
effect of making the regional
climate more extreme with

colder winters and hotter
summers. Currently, water
levels in the Aral are less
than 10% of what they were
50 years ago. Whilst this is a
dramatic example of cotton
farming, similar environmen-
tal mayhem can be seen
globally.
