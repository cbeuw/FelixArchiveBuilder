CANCER
VIRGO
This week you get
adventurous with
your Domino’s order
and stay off the
Margherita path. The
first slice you pick up
has an eyeball on it.
Illuminati!
LEO
PISCES
AQUARIUS
SAGITTARIUS
SCORPIO
LIBRA
GEMINI
TAURUS
ARIES
This week you try
protesting fossil fuels.
You try writing a
politically charged
slogan on Queen’s
Tower. Your inner
child though makes
you draw a penis
instead. You tried. It
was hard.
This week you don’t
get a horoscope.
This week you decide
to go green and try
watching locally
sourced porn. Things
get weird. Fast.
This week you try
dabbling in Satanism.
You accidentally end
up in a satin-enthusiast
swingers party. You’re
now more convinced
than ever that satin
and Satan are
connected.
This week you turn
25. You’re officially
way too old for
Imperial. Just leave
already.
This week someone gets
the last jacket potato in the
library cafe and you have
a nervous breakdown.
This week you fall
down some stairs and
sue College. The stairs
sue you back for libel.
They win.
This week the felix
office gets leftover
balloons. Everyone
gets dizzy and light-
headed trying to
inflate them. Balloons.
Not even once
This week you just
wish you were back in
the womb. Beyonce’s
womb. You want
Beyonce to be your
mommy.
This week you realise
that your room in Alban
Hall is the perfect
environment for blue
cheese making and launch
a fromagerie startup from
your bedroom. Green
on the walls, green in the
wallet.
This week you
infiltrate the No-Fap
reddit community
and pretend to be
a man who doesn’t
masturbate for a week.
You now have a third
arm and your breath
smells of man. Wait
what?
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
The other night I had a revelation. I was in Metric (classic)
enjoying the lift of the contactless limit (dangerous) and, well,
I met someone. Our eyes locked and let’s just say there were
sparks. Though someone did actually spill their drink on one
of the new tills and there might have been a small fire, I’m
telling you that first look was electrifying.
Anyway we naturally got to know each other really well
over the course of the evening (we had sex) and well I now
have penis envy. Like wow foreskins are so fun! I hadn’t seen
one before, let alone touched one!
So basically I want a foreskin. I feel like if I don’t get a fore-
skin I will never be able to have a fulfilling wank ever again.
What do I do?
Yours,
C. T. Willy
Oh Willy
I’m glad your time in Metric was so spiritually
fulfilling. It is true: The Union bars are charged
with spiritual energy and repeatedly partying
in one of the venues is a full-proof path to
Nirvana.
Like one time After having maybe six vod-
ka-redbulls within the space of an hour I
started feeling my hair. And then I started
feeling the hair of everyone in Metric. And
then I just felt so connected to everyone in the
room because we’re all mammals and have
hair (unless you have alopecia but I’m sure
you’re lovely).
This other time I started seeing water coming
down from the ceiling and filling up the light
fixtures and I wasn’t sure if I was ascending or
HOROSCOPES
just back in my room in Alban Hall.
I really need to stop minesweeping. And move
out of Alban Hall.
But I digress; Foreskins are great. There’s just
more penis to play with and last time I checked
that’s a good thing. Unless you’re not into
penis. Then it’s categorically a bad thing. Also
they’re great storage. You can use them like a
man-purse and keep loose change in them. Or
throat pastilles.
So yeah. Totally get one
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
