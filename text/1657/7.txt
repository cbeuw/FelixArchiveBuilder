Divyen Vanniasegaram condemns
the votes as a replacement for
effective democracy
R
eferendums have
been leading,
and will continue
to lead, to the
slow erosion of
P a r l i a m e n t a r y
sovereignty. The UK is a
Parliamentary representative
democracy, where
the electorate elect a
representative from their
constituency to represent them
in Parliament. These members
of parliament should vote and
act in good conscience and in
what they believe is in the best
interest of their constituents;
we do not elect delegates to
put across our everyday whims
on every single issue. Anna
Soubry MP made this exact
point during the debate on
triggering Article 50, saying
that she did not go through
the lobbies voting for what she
believed in but rather what she
had promised her constituents.
For too long, MPs have been
willing to use sloppy arguments
to justify the use of referen-
dums, such as 'giving power to
the people', whilst displaying
complete disregard for their duties as MPs
and shifting responsibility for decisions from
themselves onto the public. Referendums
introduce a competing force of sovereignty
to Parliament – an alternative way for the
people to have their say – and whilst this
appears to give the people greater choice
and control over their lives, it merely allows
simplistic populistic sentiments to dominate.
This was seen on both sides of the debate
in the recent EU referendum. Referendums
essentially allow for a tyranny of the major-
ity, no matter how slim, to dictate what
happens, and without the safeguards that
Parliament allows for this would lead to
slow erosion of rights for minority groups.
Parliament is a far better medium through
which to make key decisions, where mem-
bers can have hours of debate followed by
scrutiny by committees, and decisions not
only have to pass through the Commons
but the Lords as well, adding further safe-
guards against rash and unwise decisions.
Referendums not only lead to poor
outcomes but also allow one topic to
eclipse all others: the referendum on
leaving the EU was over seven months
ago and is still dominating the headlines.
This distracts us from other important
issues of the day such as the strife of
our NHS, prisons and housing. These
are far more important to the prosperity
of this country than our membership of
the EU.
Referendums are incredibly divisive
and for the unity of a country it is far
better that the government and par-
liament make these decisions on our
behalf, as they are too important to
be used to sow division and contempt.
These divisions will be felt for years to
come and have fortified the feelings
of separation between young and old,
north and south, urban and non-urban,
immigrants and non-immigrants.
The people may have been able to
make their decision clear, but at what
cost to Parliamentary sovereignty and
to wider society?
appointments. But so many people don't
have this, and I've witnessed people
giving up on their dreams of being a
doctor because they know they’ll never
be able to afford to finish. There is some
help available – the Student Support Fund
(which you’re helpfully emailed about as
you crawl towards the end, as though they
know you're facing hardship!) offers up to
£2,000 (sometimes a grant, sometimes a
loan) for unexpected expenses. It’s great
that they do this, but two grand doesn't
go very far when you're trying to fund an
average of around six months of expenses
that it's hard to argue were unexpected
when everyone knows how expensive
living in London is, and how the system
works.
Some supervisors are more helpful
than others – some help you find grant
extensions, put you on other projects, or
employ you as research assistants, while
others misguidedly believe that a project
with three years of funding should take
you three years and if you don't manage
to finish it in that time, it's your problem.
It shouldn't be the case that your very
quality of life is dependent on whether
you get an empathetic supervisor, have a
partner on whom you can be dependent,
or have well-off parents who are willing
to give you handouts, particularly when
you're in your late twenties.
Unlike an undergraduate or master's

degree, you don't do a PhD to
get rich. People with PhDs will
earn, on average over their
lifetime, less than someone
with only a masters degree,
thanks to these years of very
low income and a minimal
difference to later earnings.
You do a PhD because you're
passionate about something,
and it's easy to see how the
prospect of years of just about
getting by could be off-putting
and a huge barrier to entry for
lower-income students, even
without the challenges caused
by inadequate support.
Other countries do it better;
the UK is one of the only
countries where doctoral
candidates are treated like
this. In most countries, PhD
studies afford a level of respect
that brings with it a consistent
and adequate salary. By
forcing us into unpaid work,
our background becomes
crucial, and those without the
right background just don't
have the same opportunities.
When postgraduate students
don't get equal treatment to
our friends who got 'real jobs',
the system becomes inherently
classist. In the same way that
the working class were kept
out of universities in the past,
they're still being forced out
now. Academia used to be a
place where the curious rich
could play, but we moved
on from that hundreds of
years ago, and now it’s full of
passionate people wanting to
make a difference and break
new grounds of knowledge.
Why do we insist that only the
privileged get the pleasure of
doing that?

T
he UK has a vast
historic class divide
– only those from
the upper-middle
classes who are in
severe denial about
our country would go so
far as to say that class does
not remain a huge cultural
barrier today. Education has
traditionally been something
for the rich, and our modern
higher education system is
designed to, in theory, reverse
this. Today, no one, politicians
claim, is prevented from
attending university because
they can't afford it.
And to some extent, this is
true. I started university with
an assessed family income well
below the lowest threshold. I
got bursaries and loans; sure, I
have £50,000 of debt that I’m
going to be paying off for the
rest of my life, but at the time
I wasn't lacking for money.
This class divide bit me in the
backside in other ways at
Imperial where, relative to the
majority of grammar school
or privately-educated students
(or even just those who went
to good middle-class schools
in south east England), my
rural Welsh state education
just didn't stack up, and I
struggled more than most.
Further to the educational
difficulties, socialising at a
Russell Group university when
you're someone into whom
entitlement and assertiveness
have not been bred can make
you a bit awkward at best,
and a social pariah at worst.
But, all this aside, I was able
to get a phenomenally well-
respected undergraduate
degree, something that my
parents certainly never did,
and so, to some extent, the
system works. Great.
Where the system
is completely failing
working class students is in
postgraduate study, and I
think Imperial is particularly
guilty of ignoring this. The
process of getting a doctorate
is simply not designed for
someone who is not able to
self-fund at least part of their
studies, and this requirement
can be a dealbreaker –
particularly when you want
to study in the most expensive
neighbourhood in the country.
Most PhD students get the
basic annual stipend of about
£15,500 (although most DTCs
(Doctoral Training Centres)
and the Imperial scholarships
pay significantly more. Why,
I wonder, are these students
deserving of more money?)
which just about gets you a
GradPad room and a handful
of change. Sure, you can
rent private accommodation,
but even then this amount of
money is barely enough to
scrape by on. Undergrads
living on much less money and
eating beans on toast every
night: yes, I hear you, but
after nine years at imperial I
deserve to be able to afford
a fucking burrito if I want one
(and there are more legitimate
reasons for us needing more
money, such as needing
suitable attire for conferences,
having families to support, and
our daily coffee intake being
significantly higher). Most
PhD students, particularly
the poorer ones, tend to
supplement this with hours of
GTAing, which takes up a huge
amount of time, and really
eats into your work, meaning
lower quality research.
And then, of course, there's
the matter of how long your
funding lasts. Although it's
very unusual (even for the
best student) to finish a PhD
completely in three years
(most take almost four),
huge numbers of us only
get funding for three years.
Some people manage to get
funding extensions, but, for
most, what it works out to is
almost a year of unpaid work.
Does that seem reasonable?
Or more like slave labour?
We can't leave, because we
need to finish our degree, and
unlike in other countries such
as Germany, we can't claim
benefits because we're still
technically students. And trust
me, it takes this long. We're
not just faffing around and
taking our time because we're
too comfortable.
With this unpaid component
of your PhD being almost
a necessity, how can you
prepare for it? You have
contaminates the glovebox:
research is unpredictable and
it's the ones at the bottom of
the ladder who are suffering
for it.
A study by Swansea
University found that just
under 5% of students are
in some way involved in
the sex industry. This may
seem completely alien from
our experience at an elite
university of predominately
wealthy students, but even if
their data is skewed, they still
collected data from thousands
of students that demonstrates
that it’s not a minor problem.
I remember being surprised to
read (in a different study) that
no idea how long it will be,
and you can’t really save up
earlier in your studies either.
You probably can’t get a loan
as you have no income, and
so unless you're fortunate
enough to have family or
friends who can support you,
usually you're in a really
sticky situation. And it's
unpredictable; it can spring up
on anyone whose results are
delayed or unexpected. When
a colleague takes six months
writing their part of a paper,
or your samples get destroyed
when an MSci student
around 10% of female PhD
students turn to prostitution
towardstheendoftheirstudies.
This isn't really surprising. I’ve
seen final year PhD students
who are writing the most
challenging document of their
lives, eking out a can of soup
for a full day, because they
can't afford to buy any more
food than that. I've been one
of London’s hidden homeless
since September, taking
advantage of the generosity
of friends who put a roof over
my head (and often food in my
belly), and having short bursts
in hostels when I can't find a
place to stay. London’s hostels
are full of people like me, all
stuck. We have smartphones
and nice clothes to wear,
but we're still scraping by at
the mercy of other people’s
kindness.
And remember, even if you
can raise enough money to
support yourself by turning
a trick here and there, or
tutoring rich GCSE students
living in Notting Hill, you can't
move house, get a new phone
contract, or do anything
that requires a credit check,
because you don't have a
reportable income. Like many
in London, you're stuck with
illegal sublets on gumtree and
dodgy jailbroken iPhones on
eBay, making you feel like you
don't quite belong anywhere.
Some people are less
fortunate than me. My father
has been scraping together
and offering me every last
spare penny, and my mother
has been insistent on sending
me money for things like
contact lenses and dentist
