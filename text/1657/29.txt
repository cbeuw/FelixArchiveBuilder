An event that’s hotter
than the library.
Meet the Candidates 2017
01.03.17 | The stakes have been raised
This year for Meet the Candidates,
we’re doing things a little differently,
so what’s new?
- We’re putting our candidates on
stage in front of a live audience, as
well as streaming it all across
the internet
- We’re asking tougher questions
- We’re changing the way the panel
judge our candidates
What does that mean?
It’s a brand new setup. More exciting,
more tension, and more drama.
Meet the Candidates is your chance
to see who your candidates are, and
what they stand for.
We’ll be putting them on the spot,
grilling them, and dissecting their
policies. Our teams from ICRadio
and ICTV will be on hand to get your
questions and ask their own.
We’ve got limited spaces available on
the night, so sign up now via our
website. If you’re in a campaign
team, then this event is absolutely
essential. It’s not to be missed.
