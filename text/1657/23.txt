SEX
Is porn hurting your brain?
Everyone, even your mum, watches porn. Would stopping make your life better?
L
ast night I
masturbated. That’s
not particularly
exciting in itself – a
pretty standard
Thursday night – but
when I found myself alone
in bed looking for some
me-time, I automatically
reached for my phone for
some inspiration. Realising
that I didn’t know when I got
in this habit, so I decided to
put down the phone and just
use my imagination. And it
was hard (no pun intended,
in fact, it was exactly the
opposite)! Somehow, I’ve
accidentally trained myself
to get turned on immediately
when I look at porn, and
simultaneously managed to
forget how to masturbate
without it, which has the
potential to be more than a
little frustrating when paired
with the unreliable battery in
my aging iPhone.
I like porn (which may be
obvious from the above state-
ment), and I think that it has
a place in anyone’s sex life, if
they want it to. Although porn
sex is frequently unrealistic,
once you’re past early teen-
agerhood and have a more
pragmatic view of what sex is
and isn’t like in reality, it can
be a great way to explore
different things, and find
out what you do and don’t
like. And it can just be really
fucking hot, which is always
good in a source of visual
entertainment.
But is it bad for you? There’s
a lot of crackpot shit on the
internet about how stopping
watching porn will make you
taller, less angry, have clearer
skin, and somehow will make
you less submissive to the Illu-
minati. It’s also cited as giving
you “destructive erections”,
better dream recollection,
and an urge to expand your
mind. However, no reliable
source was given, and so
we’re choosing to ignore
these #AlternativeFacts.
Keeping it real though,
let’s be grown up enough to
admit that we all use porn, at
least occasionally, and that’s
perfectly okay. I think we’re
all on the same page that
masturbating is healthy, but
it’s easy to get stuck in a rut.
In the same way that years
of intense wanking can make
it difficult to enjoy handjobs
from a friend, consistently
using porn to feed your
fantasies makes it harder for
your brain to go it alone.
Porn makes it easy to rapidly
alleviate the physical sexual
frustration, and who wants
to make time for pleasuring
themselves in their busy life?
But does this seem healthy?
We’re limiting our abilities
to use our imagination, and
training ourselves only to
respond to certain stimuli. As
well as restricting the way
we get ourselves off, this can
translate into problems in
your wider sex life.
There’s a growing move-
ment against any use of porn
for masturbation, and I don’t
just mean amongst the creepy
pick-up artistry toting neck-
beards occupying the NoFap
forums on reddit. I don’t know
if that’s completely necessary,
but I think it is important to be
aware of how your thought
processes can be affected by
what you’re choosing to wank
to. In the same way that mas-
turbatory reconditioning is a
disturbing technique used to
‘cure’ homosexual tendencies
and ‘retrain’ ‘correct’ desires,
the same principle applies
when you consistently mas-
turbate to certain imagery.
In a classic Pavlovian way,
you become conditioned to
become turned on only by
porn – a learned behaviour
that can manifest as discerni-
ble neurological changes.
Porn sex can frequently be
violent and problematic, and
teaching yourself only to be
aroused by this imagery could
lead to some questionable
behaviours down the line in
\\ Not watching
porn will make you
less submissive to the
Illuminati \\
\\ Brainwashing
yourself into enjoy-
ing anything exclu-
sively sounds like a
risky manoeuvre \\
a desperate quest for satis-
faction with a partner (which
is fine, if that’s what they’re
also into, but not so much if
they want to explore a more
varied diet).
Brainwashing yourself
into enjoying any one thing
exclusively sounds like a risky
manoeuvre in any case, and
one that’s best avoided. This
can mean curating your porn
habit by varying the content,
and maybe sometimes
making that content come
straight from your mind.
It’s like those brain training
games, only a little more fun!
You’re definitely going to get
a first if even your wanking
time is being used to develop
your cognitive abilities.
I don’t think that we need to
break the porn habit entirely,
but maybe occasionally try
and do something different:
try a new butt plug, hang
upside down from the ceiling,
but most importantly, use your
imagination.
\\ Porn makes it
easy to rapidly al-
leviate the physical
sexual frustration,
and who wants to
make time for pleas-
uring themselves in
their busy lifestyle?\\
DON’T COM IN !
Would you like
some pizza?
