Romeo and Ju-
liet | Updated
and abridged
R
egardless of
whether you're
madly in love, or
frankly you've
had enough of it
this week, there's
still something inherently
appealing about the tragic
tale of Romeo and Juliet.
Squeezed into a running
time of just one hour, the
National Theatre’s inter-
pretation sets a shortened
version of the original text in
a modern time. Occasionally
we missed out on the edited
dialogue (I could not help but
pity the charismatic Mercutio,
whose lengthy and elaborate
monologue of Queen Mab
and the fairies was cut rather
cruelly short); however, this
well-choreographed and
dynamic production kept all
the key scenes, succeeding in
telling the story in an engag-
ing and moving way.
Romeo Montague, initially
besotted with an unseen
Rosaline, is persuaded to
attend a party hosted by
Capulet, where his close
friend Mercutio hopes Romeo
will let his eye wander.
Romeo, hoping that he will
catch a glimpse of Rosaline,
agrees, and the minimalist set
is transformed into a vibrant
party scene with stream-
ers, lights, and balloons
suspended from a netted
canopy. Through a crowd
of swirling and colourful
costumes, Romeo catches
sight of Juliet, instantly
falls hopelessly in
love with her – all
feelings for Rosa-
line vanishing.
The young
lover's first whis-
pered meeting
under the starry
canopy seems
all too brief,
before Juliet is
near-dragged
away to be told
that Romeo is
the only son of
her family’s worst
enemy, Montague.
Abruptly the conflict
between houses stains
the happy scene, and we
start to notice the cultural
differences between the two
families. Juliet appears in a
mixture of traditional Indian
garments and 'noughties'
neon, whilst Romeo’s local
church features a gospel choir
(complete with a rousing
rendition of ‘O Happy Day’)
led by Friar Lawrence’s
Helen Money-Kyrle
female equivalent, Sister
Lawrence, hinting at Romeo’s
African roots. Though this
difference is never directly
addressed, the underlying
clash of cultures provides an
interesting context for the
feud between houses, which
Shakespeare leaves intention-
ally unexplained.
But the lovers prove us
wrong, with Romeo swearing
his love to Juliet as she sits
on her balcony. The next

morning the young lovers
meet, and are secretly mar-
ried by Sister Lawrence.
It almost seems too good
to be true when Mercutio
and the love-struck Romeo
come across Juliet’s fiery
cousin Tybalt who’s ready
to pick a fight. Never have
I seen Tybalt played with
such attitude – by a woman
may I add – who’s knife to
Mercutio’s chest sends blood-
red rose petals flying across
the stage. Chalk outlines
drawn around the bodies of
Mercutio and Tybalt turn the
stage into a crime scene, and
serve to remind the audience
of the events which signal the
beginning of the end.
With Romeo banished
from Verona, and with her
father planning her wedding
to another man, Juliet des-
perately seeks the help of
Sister Lawrence, who agrees
to help her fake her death
so that she can escape with
Romeo. But in an unbearable
twist he hears not of the plan
but of her tragic death, and
goes to see her body with a
vial of deadly poison.
The ending was always
going to be agonising, but
I was horrified to see Juliet
awake to witness Romeo take
the poison. He realises that
she lives, but it is too late – to
her tormented cries he dies
in her arms. Devastated, she
takes her own life, and we
are left wondering whether
we should feel pained
that they could never be
together, or find some
solace that in their
deaths they proved
that love could sur-
pass the cultural and
social boundaries
imposed upon them.
Leaving, we are
asked: “What’s in a
name? that which we
call a rose/By any
other name would
smell as sweet” and
we are left wondering if
we can really answer it,
hoping that in our modern
world love can overcome
such obstacles.

obots, the Science
Museum’s shiny
newly-opened
exhibition, is a
real treasure
trove of delights:
featuring over 100 robots
models it spans 500 years
of humanity's quest to
recreate itself in the form
of a machine, a process
historically shaped by
religion, industrial innovation,
and popular culture.
Among the star attractions
is the UK-built RoboThespian,
a full-size humanoid robot
who also gave the official
opening speech, receiving
quite of a standing ovation
from the press. He engages
in vocal exercises, and gives
a theatrical performance to
visitors every 20 minutes.
The pieces are strik-
ing – from a 16th
century
automaton of a monk to a
244-year-old working model
of a silver swan automaton
created by inventor John
Merlin – and must have daz-
zled in their day. Ben Russell,
the exhibition's lead curator,
points out that most people in
the past would not have even
seen a mechanised clock
when they first clapped
eyes on an automaton,
so all this was surely
mesmerising to
the audiences of
1560.
In every stage
of the 500-year
story, robots
have held a
mirror to man-
kind. Whether
the aim was
bringing the
Bible to life
with a mecha-
nized Christ on
the cross, or the
pursuit of leisure
with clockwork
animals and human
figurines, model makers
explored whether humans
were anything more than
merely conscious machines.
A few centuries later, in
the enlightened 18th
century,
machines became more glee-
ful, with automatons of flute
players and writers; in con-
trast, the next century brought
a style that was totally unruly,
with drunken aristocrats and
dandies all being recreated
as automata.
Despite the praise that these
machines received, the rise
of the mechanised economy
made people acutely aware
that automated spinning
devices were quickly going to
replace skilled craftsmen and
women. As a memento of this
historical moment, a replica of
Maria, the female humanoid
in the Fritz Lang’s notorious
1927 film, Metropolis, stares
at you while you approach
the second exhibition room.
In the same space, the
first tinplate toy robots for
kids, that hit the shelves in
the 1930s, are displayed
together with a replica
of the UK first robot Eric
Agnese Abrusci
Robots is on at the Science
Museum until 3rd
September
Tickets are £6.75 adults; £5.85 students.
RoboThespian, who can quote Shake-
speare at you \\ Agnese Abrusci
– presumed dismantled
after his risky world tour, he
was rebuilt by the Science
Museum for the exhibition.
Eric shares the visitors' atten-
tion jointly with his younger
brother, George, and the
giant Cygan, an Italian metal
showman built in 1957 who
shared a magazine cover
with Brigitte Bardot.
The tin men resembled
humans on the outside but
they were still operated
by cables and pulleys until
the 1990s, when engineers
began work on anthropo-
mimetic robots with plastic
skeletons and silicon tendons.
Beside humanizing robot
bodies, engineers have also
focused on the computing
leaps that allow modern
robots to converse with
people in a meaningful way,
providing information and
learning from them.
While you approach the
last section of the exhibition
dedicated to modern robots
– passing beside RoboTh-
espian, who recites Hamlet
and speaks Klingon, Pepper
designed to look after our
elderly, and Kaspar, who
helps autistic children – you
soon realise that a mecha-
nised army of robots is
imminently going to
fill people’s private
and public lives.
This change
will be just as
radical as the
development
of the internet
and social
media in the
past decade.
But no human
activity is risk
free; the go
home question
as we look the
future in its anima-
tronic eyes is what
we should fear most:
artificial intelligence or
human stupidity?
