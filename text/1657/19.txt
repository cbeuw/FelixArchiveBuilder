Ballin’ on a budget #studentlyfe
To get yourself a three-course meal
for £13, you might have to do away
with tipping, and catch the best
deals. But when the food is this good,
it’s all worth the effort at Percy and
Founders in Fitzrovia.
The food
Pooja and I split some
oysters to begin with. They
slid off their shells easily and
were so fresh I didn’t actually
need any of the chilli oil,
Tabasco or lemon they gave
alongside it, as they were
so flavourful by themselves.
Pooja had never eaten oysters
before, so she bit into them
rather than swallowing them.
I am told they don’t taste as
nice that way – but to each
their own. My other friends let
me try their pumpkin soup. It
was creamy, multi-flavoured
with sweet and spicy tones
and was a decent portion.
For mains Pooja had her sea
bream with vegetables, which
she wiped clean off the plate
because it was “really good”
as she said. The rest of us
got truffle risotto, which was
hands down the best risotto I
have ever tasted. The varying
textures of crispy onions, soft
wild mushrooms and tender
rice worked well together. It
was super yummy, and that
was before I enhanced it fur-
ther with some left over lemon
from the oysters.
For dessert I got a massive
chocolate fondant with a
light minty vanilla ice cream
that left you feeling really
fresh. The fondant wasn’t
hot enough that it burnt my
tongue, and the ice cream
didn’t give me a brain freeze,
they were both exactly right
temperatures. Pooja got
a cheesecake, and said it
was “really good” again. I
need to work on her food
descriptions. My other friend
got a really big portion of
apple crumble that tasted like
a warm hug. Just like apple
crumble should – so that went
down a treat.

As the waiter constantly
refilled our tap waters and
had patiently waited on us
with a constant smile despite
our numerous mind changes
and complicated requests, we
wanted to tip him, but didn’t
because the whole point of
eating here was to get a deal.
So we awkwardly refused
to pay the optional service
charge, but he still smiled
and was accommodating! He
was probably the best waiter
I’ve ever had, which is what
you get when you go to a
fancy restaurant. We wrote
him a note on the back of our
receipt thanking him, so at
least he knows we appreci-
ated him, even if he wasn’t
\\ We wrote him a
note, so he knows
we appreciated him,
even if he didn’t get
a tip. I don’t know
if that makes it any
better \\
Location, location, location
Whilst religiously completing my daily routine of
procrastination, I happened to view my friend’s,
who seems to have a lot of money to spend on food,
snapchat story. She always puts up gourmet looking
pictures, but whenever I google the restaurants their
prices are so student unfriendly. But when I googled
Percy and Founders, a fancy gastropub in Fitzrovia,
I found to my delight, that they have half price on
all food on certain days! So I roped some friends of
mine into trying some upmarket British gastronomy.
First Impressions
The restaurant is extremely spacious and airy,
with floor to ceiling windows, two bars and an
open kitchen. It has a series of rooms which are
cosily decorated like a dining room in a rich per-
son’s house. A waitress greeted two of my friends
and I, then led us to a bar where another friend
of ours was waiting for us whilst sophisticatedly
sipping upon his tap water. We were seated and
got down to deciding what to order.
There were a limited number of vegetarian
options, which made it easy for both of my
vegetarian friends to choose what they want.
However, my friend Pooja and I have slightly
more complicated dietary requirements. Pooja
had been talking about how she was going to
get the Sunday roast since we got onto the tube,
unfortunately the waiter informed us it was beef,
which she doesn’t eat. She then asked for the
lamb shank. The waiter took her order, disap-
peared to the kitchen, but shortly came back to
inform us that lamb is cooked in beef gravy. We
asked if a separate gravy could be made for her,
which he enquired about. It couldn’t. At least he
was intelligent enough to check out the ingredients
himself now that he knew her requirements. She
finally settled for sea bream and I got a risotto,
but not before the waiter separately went to check
whether either were cooked in alcohol, as I don’t
drink and she doesn’t like the taste of it. That took
us about 20 minutes, because of all the back and
forth.
getting a tip. I don’t know if
that makes it any better.
Instead of mints at the exit,
there was a bowl of matches,
I presume so you can light up
your post-dinner cigar. There
was a definite difference in
the taste of the food here
and that which you get at
a normal chain restaurant.
Everything had defined,
delicious flavours, and the
portion sizes meant that you
were full, but not lethargi-
cally so. I got oysters, risotto,
fondant, matches and really
good service all for the total
of around £13! Definitely
worth the money.
