Climate change
is a political
problem
\\ Viewing climate
change in this way is
crucial as it shapes the
kinds of solutions that
we look for \\
Thomas Rhidian believes that to
mitigate Climate Change we need to
first embrace political change
A
s political
desc r iptors
go, the humble
watermelon
is perhaps
predictably
an unconventional one: it is
not wheeled out too often
as a way of making a point.
It’s a charge often levelled
at politicians like Caroline
Lucas, who are accused of
being green on the outside
but red (that is, socialist) on
the inside. The scorn that
this combination provokes
on the right of the political
spectrum is telling – for too
long, environmentalism has
been seen as detached, and
even beyond politics: a fringe
interest, something best left
to millionaire celebrities with
a guilty conscience. Global
warming is often treated as if
it were a catastrophe that we
have no control over, with our
only hope being some miracle
of technology. This could
not be further from the truth;
climate change is emphatically
not like an asteroid heading
towards Earth – rather, it is the
direct result of the way that
we choose to organise our
societies and our economies.
The challenge that climate
change poses is neither
scientific nor technological,
but political.
Viewing climate change in
this way is crucial as it shapes
the kinds of solutions that we
look for. If we choose to see
global warming as an entirely
technological problem, then
we invite only technological
solutions. Accordingly,
geoengineering – large-scale
human intervention in the
climate system in an attempt to
reduce warming – has grown
over recent decades from a
fringe research interest to a
leading proposed method of
mitigating climate change.
Various different flavours
of geoengineering have
been put forward, ranging
from the seemingly benign
to the downright reckless.
An infamous example of the
latter is the proposal of Nobel
Laureate Paul Crutzen to
launch parcels of sulphur into
the high atmosphere using
artillery guns. Sulphur reflects
sunlight, and the project
would almost certainly lead to
a cooling of the atmosphere
similar to the aftermath of
a volcanic eruption. But it’s
unlikely that this would be
the only effect – even small
volcanic eruptions often
drastically alter rainfall
patterns, destroying crops
and causing extreme weather;
the effects due to a project
of Crutzen’s scale could be
even more serious. As if this
were not enough, sulphur
in the atmosphere is known
to destroy the ozone layer,
potentially exposing us to
greater levels of harmful UV
radiation from the Sun. It’s
hard to avoid feeling that the
whole project would be akin
to pinching yourself to cure a
headache – with that many
dire consequences, global
warming would probably be
the least of our worries.
It’s perhaps unfair of me to
pick the worst example of
geoengineering, and that’s
not really the aim of this
article. The problem with
geoengineering is not so
these quick-fixes become
increasingly attractive to a
corporate and political class
reluctant to alter the economic
status quo. In the words of
the political theorist Frederic
Jameson, it’s become “easier
to imagine the end of the world
than the end of capitalism”.
Climate change is not so
much a crisis of science, then,
as a crisis of capitalism. It lays
bare the central lie at the heart
of the capitalist economy –
that we are nothing more
than individuals looking to
outcompete each other, rather
than social animals who all
have a vested interest in the
fate of our shared planet.
Climate change also reminds
us that economics does not
exist in a vacuum; our actions
have material consequences,
and even if right now those
consequences seem far
away from rainy London and
Western Europe, it won’t be
long before we all feel their
effects. Ultimately, carbon
does not respect national
borders.
If we are to be serious about
avoiding climate change,
then switching off lights won’t
cut it: we must be prepared
to radically alter the way we
structure our societies and
our economies. It will involve
a wholesale change of what
we deem to be economically
important; striving for infinite
growth on a finite planet,
for example, is a game that
we’re destined to lose. The
priority must be to fairly
distribute the planet’s wealth
among its seven billion
inhabitants, accounting for the
fact that often the countries
likely to bear the brunt of
climate change are the least
equipped to do so. Limiting
global temperature rise to
manageable levels will require
that the majority of known
fossil fuel reserves stay in the
ground. We cannot gamble
on fossil fuel companies doing
this through the goodness of
their own hearts. These are the
people, after all, who would
sooner trade the future of the
planet for a quick buck than
lose their place at the top of
the economic tree.
As long as our economic
system sacrifices sustainability
in pursuit of short-term
profits, we throw away our
best chance of avoiding
devastating climate change.
Environmentalism and
progressive politics are two
sides of the same coin – red
without green is myopic;
green without red is toothless.
Perhaps, then, it’s time we
all embraced watermelon
politics.

much that it’s always bad, but
that by relying on it to save
us we are missing the point.
By framing climate change
as a purely technological
problem, we end up letting
the worst climate offenders
off the hook. This is precisely
why geoengineering is so
appealing to policymakers;
those who are used to
framing climate change as
a technological issue are
primed to seek technological
solutions, rather than make
any serious attempt to change
the economic factors driving
emissions. As years pass and
emissions continue to soar,

You have no
excuse for
not recycling
Giulia Costa gives top tips on how to
be a better human being
H
ave you ever
spent a long time
staring at the
coloured bins
wondering where
your everything
should go? Wondering if
someone is judging your bin
choice? Well good, because
recycling is important.
The global population is
rapidly increasing and our
lifestyles generate huge
amounts of waste. In the UK,
an average person generates
around 413kg of waste
every single year. The waste
produced in this country
within less than two hours
could fill the Royal Albert Hall.
Managing this wastefulness
can be done through the three
Rs: Reducing, Reusing and
Recycling. These are listed in
order of importance, but for
now, this article will focus on
the final R: Recycling.
\\ We are nudged to recycle,
but we're often not told how
to do it properly \\
A lot of recyclable material
is disposed of in general
waste bins. This is a shame as
simply disposing of rubbish
in landfill sites is incredibly
harmful to the environment
and translates to a loss of
resources. Throwing away
potentially recyclable waste
is like throwing energy
away. Recycling one tin
can, for example, would
give the equivalent energy
to powering a TV for three
hours! Recycling takes little
effort and it goes a long way.
This is why we are nudged
to recycle, but we’re often not
told how to do it properly.
At Imperial, for example,
there are excellent recycling
facilities across all campuses
and halls. But lack of clarity
when it comes to ‘what goes
where’ causes a very real loss
of efficiency. We’ve all been
there: “where should I throw
my tea bag? Should I empty
the contents into food waste
and throw the bag in paper?
What is the meaning of life?”
So we just either guess or
throw it into general waste
to be safe. But in fact there
are clear guidelines and dos
and don’ts when it comes to
recycling. (For the record,
most tea bags can simply be
thrown in the food waste as
the bags are biodegradable.)
First of all, plastic bags: Do
not throw these in dry mixed
recycling! Not all plastics can
be easily recycled. Only hard
plastics go in the green dry
mixed recycling bins. These
include things like plastic
bottles, tubs and trays. Plastics
often have a category, which
is shown on them.
Then we have pizza boxes:
Greasy pizza boxes should
not be recycled with paper,
and can make a whole batch
of paper and carton non-
recyclable. On a related
note, you should clean any
food container you throw
into recycling. It does take
more effort, but it cannot be
recycled if you don't, so the
extra effort goes a long way.
Another helpful thing you
can do is remove the caps
from plastic bottles before
throwing them in the dry
\\ Part of the
responsibility to make
this country more
sustainable lies with
those living in it \\
mixed recycling. Caps and
bottles are made of different
plastics, and separating them
makes life a lot easier for
recycling plants. But now for
something that will save you
time! Although some people
think it is necessary, you do
not have to remove labels
from food containers before
recycling them.
When it comes to glass,
not all is recyclable. Things
like window glass or glass
laboratory equipment should
not be thrown in the red
bin. The same thing goes for
packaging made out of paper
– paper cups or cartons that
are waxed should not go in
the red bin. Paper towels and
napkins should also not be
recycled, even though they're
mare made out of paper.
And if you don’t know what
to do with a particular waste
item like a nappy, some old
tights or that Celine Dion CD
you got last Christmas, that’s
okay (all of the above are
recyclable FYI). Simply not
knowing where to put waste
items is more common than
you think. Looking it up online
is always a good idea, and
if not, many items actually
have recycling instructions
on them. For items that are
trickier to recycle such as
aerosols or batteries, there
are online resources such as
Imperial College’s online
waste directory, which give
instructions of how to dispose
of them.
Many facilities have posters
that detail what gets recycled
where (Imperial will also be
adopting this measure soon).
Once you learn what goes
where you will see recycling
is not that hard!
By implementing these small
changes, recycling can be
made much more efficient.
By taking these ‘hacks’ and
applying them at home we
become even more efficient.
London is presently one of
the worst recyclers in the
UK. Countrywide, the UK’s
recycling rate for household
waste has gone down
recently bringing us further
from the EU’s goal to recycle
50% of waste. Part of the
responsibility to make this
country more sustainable lies
with those living in it. It is our
responsibility to recycle well
and efficiently to ensure a
brighter future for our planet.
If recycling is not enough for
you and you want to make a
bigger change come and join
us in ESoc and participate in
our recycling campaign.
