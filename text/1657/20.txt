Hit me up, homeslice
It really doesn’t get much better than
pizza, IMHO. However, given there
are so many variants, it’s sometimes
hard to pick the best from the bad –
so we’re here to help.
T
he hipster revolution
is upon us. No
food is safe. The
humble burger has
been embellished
with a bright
green avocado bun. If
you haven’t tried kale or
quinoa (pronounced “keen-
wah”, trust me, I have
been corrected multiple
times), frankly, where
have you been? Although
the occasional twists on
traditional dishes are
welcome, food fads are
often the products of bored
people with well-groomed
beards and usually die out in
a matter of months. Many try
too hard to be alternative and
lose sight of the practicalities
of eating. “Deconstructed”
spaghetti bolognese out of
mason jars anyone? And let’s
face it, bread served in hats is
simply unhygienic.
However, some food
fads catch on and become
mainstream. The earliest
known variation of modern
pizza originated in Naples.
Since then this world-wide
delicacy has adapted to a
variety of taste buds, which
has resulted in long running
feuds over which type is
best. In the USA alone the
famous Chicago deep-dish
is in competition with the
New York-style thin slice.
Across London the Franco
Manca pizza chain, popular
with Imperial students, is
known for its delicious and
surprisingly affordable
sourdough pizzas. As the
daughter of a baker who has
grown up with the smell of
Alice Davage
homemade sourdough bread
wafting through the house,
these pizzas are a particular
favourite of mine. In my own
kitchen I have heard far too
many arguments about pizza,
you wouldn’t think it could be
a controversial topic, and yet
whether a Hawaiian is a mon-
strosity or not is an ongoing
debate. So naturally when
it comes to pizza trends any
deviations from the norm are
essentially marmite – you’re
either going to love them or
hate them.
A few months ago while
aimlessly wandering around
Soho with rumbling stomachs,
a friend and I stumbled across
a place called Flat Planet.
Upon inspection we had
found a hipster gem. But in
a good way. Now this place
is littered with hipster décor,
featuring classic exposed
Edison light bulbs, thoroughly
doodled walls and a rather
endearing piano named Tom
with a “play me” sign. If Flat
Planet was all style and no
substance then it would have
been a disappointment. But
luckily the food was great
too. Their speciality is flat
breads if you didn’t guess
from the name. What struck
me most was that the menu
included some topping com-
binations that are different
to the classic pizza choices. I
found my Moroccan flatbread
with houmous, labneh (a type
of yogurt), tomatoes, olives,
basil, mint and rose harissa
to be a refreshing alternative
to my usual pepperoni pizza.
The flatbreads are also lighter
than most pizzas, which make
them a perfect light-ish lunch.
Pizzas that could definitely
never be considered light
are the 20˝ giants served at
Homeslice. The use of paper
plates and the fact that these
wonderful creations barely fit
on the table, meaning I was
essentially eating off my lap,
made for a more casual fam-
ily-style eating experience,
where ordering more if you’re
hungry is encouraged and
perfectly feasible considering
how quickly the pizzas arrive
after ordering. But what if
you don’t all want the same
topping? Not a problem.
There is the option to have
half one type of pizza and
a different one on the other
half! Although this does make
the pizzas incredibly artsy
looking, a plus for any avid
instagrammers and snapchat-
ters out there, it essentially
means that you have com-
bined two regular sized ones
into a more impractical 20˝.
But hey, this is definitely more
fun and a nice change for
people looking for something
out of the ordinary.
The choice of toppings are
great too. For once, vegetari-
ans are not subjected to only
two choices, a boring margh-
erita or vegetarian option that
no matter where you order it
from always seems to include
the same 5 vegetables and
overdoes it on the sweetcorn.
There has been a gap in the
market for more exciting
vegetarian pizzas for a while
and I believe Homeslice may
be the answer. Some of the
vegetarian options include
innovative toppings such as
cauliflower cheese, butternut
pumpkin and broccoli, ingre-
dients you wouldn’t normally
associate with pizza.
Homeslice also switch things
up in another way. Their
pizzas come with a range
of sauce favours instead of
just the classic tomato. This
includes the rich red wine
sauce lined base used with
their venison and kale pizza.
To put it simply, it was divine.
Naturally drinking wine to
accompany pizza tastes
great, possibly a match made
in heaven in fact, but who
would think to put the alcohol
on the pizza instead? For the
people who aren’t in love
with the flavour of red wine,
Homeslice also offer other
interesting tomato sauce alter-
natives, such as sweetcorn
purée and garlic.
The archetypal standard
round pizza with cheese and
tomato sauce is irreplaceable
and will always hold a place
in my heart. But sourdough,
flatbread and unusually large
pizzas are variations I can
get on board with. Someone
had to come up with a crazy
spark of genius for all the
foods we enjoy today to be
invented in the first place. But
equally if you chose to stick to
Domino’s, then fair enough, I
won’t judge (much).
