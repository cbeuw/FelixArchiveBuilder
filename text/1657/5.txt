Is being a
sabb bad for
your health?
An anonymous writer worries that
the Union is not doing enough for its
sabbatical officers
Y
ear on year, the
process of the
Union elections
c h e r r y - p i c k s
those who are
some of the
most vulnerable to lead us as
sabbatical officers.
This makes sense – those who
have experienced difficulties
during their time at Imperial
are the ones who know the
system, and the ones who are
most likely to be passionate
about it. This isn't always the
case, of course: we have a lot
of egomaniacs and people
posturing to be career politi-
cians who have very long-term
goals in mind. But the person
who has had experience with
the mental health support at
Imperial is more likely to want
to improve it by donating their
time as DPW. The person who
wouldn't have made it through
second year without their
sports team is going to want
to be DPCS to make sure that
everyone else has the same
opportunities. The person who
nearly failed third year but
didn't because of their aca-
demic support may turn out to

be passionate enough to run
for DPE.
And this isn't a bad thing.
These are the people who've
needed the resources most, the
ones who know how powerful
the Union can be. They truly
do care (probably too much),
unlike the majority of students
who get in and out with their
degree, never pausing to look
back. They aren't the ones
who wanted the most bang for
their buck, taking advantage
of what was on offer without
ever giving back.
But, students who meet the
criteria that qualify them as a
strong sabbatical candidate
are being thrown into the pres-
sure cooker environment of
the Union, and left high and
dry when it comes to receiving
any kind of support through the
process.
Both during campaign-
ing and after it (whether or
not they have been elected)
there is a distinct lack of sup-
port for the students who are
putting themselves out there,
putting their heart and soul
into something they believe
in. Campaigning is immensely
stressful for everyone, and for
those who are unsuccessful, it
can be a massive blow. In the
past, the Union has run ses-
sions ahead of the elections to
let people know what they're in
for, what being a sabb is like,
and to give them tips on how
to cope with it. That doesn't
seem to have materialised this
year, leaving this year's candi-
dates potentially unprepared.
Some sabbs get lucky, and
enter a full team of Union staff
who are able to manage their
workload and support them.
But others enter the teams that
the ever-present staff short-
ages have hit hardest, forcing
them to push themselves to fill
a full time staff role as well as
meeting manifesto points that
they're held accountable to
achieve.
But the sabbs are just students.
They are not fully fledged grad-
uates who have applied for
these jobs. They are students
who have been given these
roles, with very little experi-
ence relevant to being a trustee
of a multi million pound charity,
because they care. And it's this
determination to better things

and to care that can be a det-
riment to their mental health.
These days, each sabb has
a line manager who is respon-
sible for them, whether that
means supervising their email
traffic, assigning them tasks,
or ensuring they are staying
on track. But when it takes five
months to give Union welfare
officers mental health first aid
training that was due during
the handover at the begin-
ning of the year, how can we
expect each of the senior man-
agement group to be trained
to handle the mental health of
the students under their care?
The way that sabbatical
officers are being handled
poses a huge risk to their
mental health, one that the
Union is steadfastly refusing to
acknowledge or take any steps
to mitigate. In the absence of
any staffing problems, if the
Union functioned as a well-
oiled machine, then these roles
might be suitable, but thanks to
poor management, the sabbs
are the ones who are suffering.
The Union is being irrespon-
sible. Irresponsible in the way
that it is recruiting candidates

without fully preparing them,
and irresponsible in the way
it's failing to support them.
There is a long legacy of
ex-sabbatical officers dealing
with their mental health fallout
for years following their time at
the Union, and it's a trend that
needs to stop now.
Hopefully one day soon the
Union will take notice of the
trail of sabbs it’s leaving in its
wake, but when you’re watch-
ing the future sabbs battle it
out on Meet the Candidates,
spare a thought for just how
much they’re giving up for your
sakes. And if you’re planning
on running for a sabbatical
position, for God’s sake make
sure you take care of yourself,
because no one else will.

management, the sabbs are
