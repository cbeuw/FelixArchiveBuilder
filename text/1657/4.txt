Alban Hall is located on High
Street Kensington, a step
away from the tube and a
convenient ten minute walk
from the South Kensington
Campus.
“Over time it has become
clear that the problems which
at first were minor have now
become a part of our daily
lives and are increasingly
more dangerous. In the past
week alone the washing
machines flooded, the internet
was down for three days and
I have been served gone
off food. Aside from these
temporary annoyances, there
are many long term issues
which repeatedly get patched
up only to go wrong again
further down the line, but this
time ten times worse. Sinks
and showers do not drain
properly the consequences of
which at first were floods, then
mould growing on the walls
Alban Hall living conditions deemed poor
Students considering withholding rent
Lef Apostolakis
to be a result of Heythrop
College’s uncertain future.
Heythrop, which specialises
in philosophy and theology, is
currentlysettobeclosingdown
in 2018, after failed attempts
to form a partnership with the
University of Roehampton.
Earlier last year, it was
revealed by the Evening
Standard that agent CBRE
was hired earlier last year by
Jesuits in Britain, freeholders of
the property, to sell the prime
plot of Kensington estate.
A Jesuits in Britain
spokesperson told the Evening
Standard that the move to
sell was at least partially
motivated by financial loses.
The bidding was expected to
start at at least £100 million.
“Heythrop College incurs
a significant financial deficit
each year. The financial reality
is that as a small institution,
within this highly competitive
higher education environment
and with the costly regulatory
demands, it cannot continue in
its current form.”
The Halls at Heythrop
College will most likely be
accepting new tenants for the
academic year of 2017/2018.
Whether there are plans to
refurbish the estate before it’s
sold off is unclear. But based
on the current situation we
think it’s unlikely.
F
ollowing the reveal
of the poor housing
conditions at Evelyn
Gardens earlier last
year, another Hall
of Residence has
been found guilty of offering
sub-par accommodation,
after numerous reports were
brought to felix’s attention.
This time, students at Alban
Hall have had to consistently
deal with plumbing, electrical,
and, possibly the worst of all,
internet connectivity issues
since the very beginning of
their accommodation. But the
recent, rapid deterioration of
conditions, including flooding
in the laundry facilities, a
three day long internet cut and
reported serving of expired
food (Alban is a catered Hall),
has made many disgruntled
residents speak out. “It’s
an absolute dangerous
shit show”, says Joseph
University of London college
in which Alban is situated)
left the computer suite open
to residents overnight. A
Facebook post by one of the
wardens read “Heythrop are
keeping the computing suite
open in the main building
tonight... They’ve asked us to
pass on their apologies – they
had hoped to have it fixed
today.”
But these are just extreme
examples in a string of
persisting issues. The plights of
Alban’s residents include but
are not limited to: days without
internet, laundry machines in
need of repair, clogged drains
leading to leaks, flooding, and
mould; plug sockets routinely
at UCL.
Despite the frustration of
Alban Hall residents, there
is no animosity against the
wardens “I think the wardens
and sub-wardens are doing
their best to help students out.
In fact, I have no ill feelings
towards the people running
the hall. However, I hope from
the bottom of my heart that my
225quidperweekinrentmight
finally be put to better use,”
says May Kyaw a first year
biochemist. Imperial students
pay, approximately £7,700 a
year for their accommodation
at Alban Hall. Their Heythrop
equivalents pay £6,400.
In response a College
spokesperson said “We
are aware that issues were
raised with wardens in
Alban Hall earlier this term,
and apologise to students
affected. We understand that
the issues were discussed at
a Hall Committee and quickly
addressed. We are concerned
to hear that felix have received
reports of ongoing problems.
“We take any reports of
problemswithaccommodation
very seriously and encourage
students to come forward
with any issues if the arise. In
Alban Hall, students should
contact the Hall management
staff (located in the Heythrop
College Accommodation
Office) directly with reports of
any problems.”
The lack of action is thought

dangerous shit

O’Connell-Danes a first year
chemist and unlucky resident
of the decrepit Hall, “there is
fast growing contempt for the
halls and increasing chatter in
about rent reductions being
deserved.”
Last Monday, in a desperate
attempt to appease internet
deprived students, the
management at Heythrop (the
losing power, leading to
fridges without power and
the subsequent rotting of
groceries.
“When we first moved in to
Alban Hall it was obvious that
everything was a bit run down
but that was the price to pay
for a great location and being
catered” says Ella Vialle-Sole,
another chemistry undergrad.
(which is not the best when
you are asthmatic), and finally
the leaking water filled all the
lights in the bathrooms and
stopped them from working.
It was lucky no one got
electrocuted”
The poor living conditions
have led to the creation of a
Facebook page dedicated to
memes trying to make light of
the situation. Some students
however are considering
serious action involving
withholding rent like their
counterparts have been doing \\ Memethrop
