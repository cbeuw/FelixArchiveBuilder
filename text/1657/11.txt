The global bee decline is endangering more than just our multi-million honey industry. With bees
being the predominant and certainly the most economically significant pollinator, we literally can’t
afford to lose them. Bee enthusiast Sarah Barfield Marks talks bees and what you can do to help
them.
O
ver the past
few years,
discussion
of the rapid
decline
of bee
populations has intensified.
Every week there seems
to be another alarming
headline implying that
honeybee population decline
is something we should care
about. Do bees truly impact
the world as we know it?
Wouldn’t we do just fine
without them? Exploring
the subjects that bees have
mastered may be a good
way to start answering those
questions.
Bees lead complex lives that
carefully balance our ecosys-
tem. Only bees make honey,
so how exactly is this uniquely
delicious food created?
Honeybees travel from one
plant to another to sip nectar
which goes into their honey
tummy (different from their
the food chain. Worldwide,
one third of food crops from
blueberries to sweet potatoes
are in some way bee-depend-
ent. Not all are completely
reliant on bees, but the effect
of bees can be seen in most.
Many flowers, such as pears,
produce larger and more
homogeneous fruits when
often visited and properly pol-
linated by bees. Can humans
truly hope to develop such a
perfect pollination process
to replace the one that bees
have evolved over millions of
cited that renting a hive can
cost up to $180 per season
during peak almond produc-
tion. Pollinating almonds each
season in California with sup-
plemental hives costs the state
around $180 million (over
one million extra needed from
outside the state)!
Thus, honeybees are so
important that companies
Helping out a bee in need
are paying huge amounts to
compensate for the lack of
bees in their area. But what
exactly is causing the decline?
Ongoing research at Imperial
and worldwide has cited pes-
ticides as a leading factor of
bee decline. Climate change,
mites, and disease have also
been investigated as possible
causes. Trucking bees over
long distances puts the colo-
nies under greater stress and
increased risk for pathogen
transmission, as infected colo-
nies are no longer isolated.
We’re now more informed
If bees could lecture
at Imperial, they might
teach…
The hexagonal honeycomb
uses the least amount of wax
to create the largest area to store
honey (wax is energy intensive and it
takes 8 oz. of honey to produce 1 oz. of
wax). On a side note, this same shape
allows ice to achieve maximum
space between molecules giving
it a lower density than water.
Honey is a natural
antibacterial fluid still
used in hospitals today.
Bees only seal the
honey cell with wax when
the moisture content of the
honey reaches around 20% (too
little moisture and the honey starts
fermenting).

food stomach). In the process,
they pick up pollen on their
legs and body from each
plant. As they move, they
transfer pollen between male
and female plants of the same
species to pollinate them.
Once their honey stomach is
full, they fly back to the hive
and pass the nectar to worker
Honey is the bees’ winter
food source when it is too
cold to forage. The rest of
the year, bees are critically
important to pollination.
Beyond their centrality to
many plant life cycles, bees
have an important role in
years? Successful pollination
is so important that farmers in
places like America are now
forced to hire trucks filled with
beehives to pollinate their
crops. An article by Slate

bees. Worker bees chew the
nectar while excreting special
enzymes until the nectar
becomes honey. Honey is
then placed in wax cells and
fanned by bees using their
wings until it is ready to be
capped with wax for storage.

on the problems facing
honeybees, but what are we
supposed to do about it? Bees
seem small and uninterested
in help, though help is clearly
needed.
Starting your own hive is
one idea. This is being done
from the Essex countryside
to New York City rooftops
and it’s easier than you think!
Smaller contributions include
planting bee friendly plants
in your garden, but most
importantly, without using
pesticides. Avoiding pesti-
cides is a very simple and
deeply powerful commitment
you can give to bees. Just
let nature do its thing and
pull out weeds that you can’t
stand occasionally (although
weeds are also bee friendly).
Lastly, even bees like a drink
or two, so keeping water in
a bird feeder or shallow dish
for them is also beneficial.
