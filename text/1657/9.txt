Putin has a
huge power
hard on
Charles Titmuss explains why Putin is
probably ecstatic right now
F
rom his images in
National Media (and
yes, those do require
capital letters), it’s
clear that Vladimir
Vladimirovich Putin
has a hard on for one man:
himself. Whether he’s shirtless
fishing, riding a horse, or
killing a bear with his bare
hands, Putin’s got a thing for
being the manliest manly
Russian man around. And
right now he has the added
advantage of being the
shrewdest and luckiest foreign
policy operator in the world.
Russian foreign policy for
the last 20 years has been
one of resurgence. Russia
has been a major player in
Europe since the 18th
Century
with the establishment of the
Russian Empire, and was a
major player in the Napo-
leonic Wars in the early
1800s, the Crimean War,
and numerous wars against
the Ottoman and Persian
Empires. At the start of the
20th
century, Russia initiated
the Russo-Japanese War and
took part in the First World
War. In 1917, the Soviet
Union was created, and the
Empire became the USSR.
The Soviet Union would
allow Russia to project its
power worldwide like never
before, defeating Nazi Ger-
many, and engaging with the
US in the Cold War. Follow-
ing the collapse of the Berlin
wall in 1989, and the subse-
quent collapse of the USSR
and its economy, Russia has
been comparatively weak.
This is the historic hangover
that Putin is operating with:
he wants to re-elevate Russia
back to the superpower status
that it once possessed. With
this goal of international
influence in mind, it is pos-
sible to consider Putin to be
arguably one of the world’s
most skilled international
politicians and certainly one
\\ Through a combination
of good luck and shrewd
foreign policydecisions, Putin

of the luckiest. Despite eco-
nomic, social and political
turmoil, somehow Putin has
managed to surf the wave
and get to the beach shirt-
less and smug as hell. Russian
influence and prevalence in
foreign policy is at the fore-
front of everyday life, more
so than at any time for the
past two decades.
To support such a bold
assertion, it is critical to look
at Russian foreign efforts:
Putin has managed to pull
off the first successful mili-
tary intervention in a Middle
Eastern country by a foreign
power in living memory. By
supporting the Assad regime,
an established force in Syria
with significant local support,
Putin has been able to main-
tain Russian influence in the
region, as well as humiliate
the West in its rather pathetic
and non-committal effort to
support the rebellion. Putin
has also been able to manipu-
late the presence of so-called
Islamic state to give his brutal
campaign and the Assad
regime some legitimacy. Air
strikes are always conducted
against ‘terrorists’, which is
apparently anyone that has
an objection to being indis-
criminately bombarded and
gassed.
The war in Syria has also
had a possibly unforeseen
benefit for Russia the refu-
gee crisis. Nearly five million
people have been displaced
internationally as a result of
the civil war, sparking the
migrant crisis for the EU and
significantly impacting inter-
national relations between
its members. Countries such
as Greece, Hungary and
Romania have had to bear
the brunt of this, which has
led to increased tension
between nations in Western
and Northern Europe that
have tried and succeeded to
dodge sharing the burden. It
has also led to the increased
\\ Trump is

Russian, presumably

popularity of anti-EU and
migrant demagogues, threat-
ening the break-up of the
EU. The EU is a significant
economic opposition force
to Russia with members that
were once a part of the USSR
economic sphere. Any weak-
ening of this coalition is to
Russia’s benefit.
Speaking of foreign wars,
let’s not forget Ukraine.
Following the Orange Revo-
lution and the establishment
of Petro Poroshenko, Russia
has decided to gently use
military coercion to bring
the nation back into the fold.
This bears some similarity to
the invasion of Georgia, or
the subjugation of Chech-
nya. Russia annexed the
Crimea and is currently fight-
ing a clandestine war in the
Donetsk region in order to
destabilise the pro-western
regime. The preoccupation
of western media with Senor
Trump has allowed the
increasing violence of this
war to go almost unnoticed.
Finally, there is El Trumpo
himself. He is unashamedly
pro-Russian, as are mem-
bers of his advisory council,
presumably because one
would-be tyrant appreciates
another, actual tyrant. Putin
no longer has to worry quite
so much about things such
as sanctions that would be
almost guaranteed under the
Obama administration. Some
of those sanctions previously
imposed may be lifted in
order to cement the collab-
oration between the White
House and the Kremlin.
So all in all, through a
combination of good luck
and shrewd foreign policy
decisions, Putin is in a great
place. Despite the challenges
to the Russian economy, he
has been able to expand
Russian hegemony interna-
tionally, and is now in an
excellent position to continue
to do so: the US and EU,
previously major opponents
to Russian expansion, have
either been rendered friendly
or are preoccupied with inter-
nal political problems, and
Russian military prestige is at
\\ The US and the

an all-time high following the
successful stabilisation of the
Assad regime. The question
of 'where next?' is an impor-
tant one. Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia are all previous
components of the Russian
Empire, and have large
native Russian populations,
perfect for another uprising
situation as in Ukraine. How-
ever, these nations are NATO
allies, so such a move could
be disastrous for Russia and
the world. We shall have to
wait and see.
