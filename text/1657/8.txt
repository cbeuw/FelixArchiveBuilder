Query your
consumerism
Valerie Wischott thinks we should all
hold ourselves accountable for our
unsustainable lifestyles
I
buy these flip-flops from
H&M for every summer
– after one year, they’re
broken. But it doesn’t
matter, they’re only
€7.” “I already booked
my journey back home for
Christmas holidays – got a
flight for €10!” All of you
have probably said something
along these lines at some
point. These quotes reflect
the attitude that dominates
today’s consumer behaviour.
We are used to the permanent
availability of all our desired
products, from food to fashion
to flights, and we can acquire
them at low prices. At the same
time, the world is worrying
about climate change,
desertification and pollution,
and thus establishes goals and
agreements in order to protect
the environment. A common
sense view on the causality
chain of the environmental
destruction reveals that our
consumer behaviour is at
the top of this chain and
represents an essential factor
with regard to the changes of
the environment. Everyone’s
daily life contains consumption
decisions which have a direct
or indirect influence on the
environment. While some
things seem obvious, others
have to be investigated more
carefully in order to trace
\\ We are used to the
permanent availability of all
our desired products \\
back their influence. In doing
so, the whole life cycle of a
product or a service has to be
taken into account.
To start off, what plays a
major role in all our lives?
Food! Our first association
with the environment might
be the consumption of animal
products, which has come to
the fore due to the currently
increasing popularity of
vegetarian/vegan lifestyles.
Animals need area to live.
They also need food, which
in turn needs area and water
to grow. The need for area –
which is particularly high for
cattle ranching – results in the
deforestation of rainforests.
However, the assumed
sustainable lifestyle which
excludes the consumption of
animal products can have its
drawbacks: The increasing
demand for the avocado, with
its vitamins and unsaturated
fatty acids being one of the
most popular 'superfoods',
is causing a loss of forest
and needs huge amounts of
water (the cultivation of one
kilogram of avocados needs
more than five times as much
water as one of tomatoes).
Besides food, the mobile
phone has become the
centre of our lives. The
rapid development of new
technologies leads to an
ever-decreasing lifespan of
our electronical devices: we
replace products because it
is difficult to repair them or
to benefit from technological
innovations. The problem is
that smartphones contain
up to 60 different chemical
elements (30 of which are
metals) whose extraction and
subsequent disposal cause
contamination of soil, water
and air.
Speaking of contamination
leads us to the consumption
of fashion, which has
transformed into 'fast fashion'
during recent years, with
vast quantities of clothes
being produced at an ever
increasingfrequency(clothing
production doubled from
2000 to 2014). To point out
just one of the issues with this,
the immense need for water
in cotton production resulted
in the reduction in area and
water level of the Aral Sea by
50% from 1950/60 to 2007.
Issues connected to that
include the contamination of
groundwater and agricultural
products due to sand storms.
Another aspect of our
lives that has come to feel
perfectly natural is travelling.
How long ago was your last
\\ There are

long-distance journey? For
me, its's less than a year.
One problem with tourism
is the transportation to the
destination: the aeroplane
is the biggest transportation
polluter, releasing the most
CO2
emissions per passenger
kilometre and being used
for the longest distances.
An additional aspect is the
on-site influence of tourism,
including land degradation
and the overuse of resources
like land, fresh water, and
energy.
These examples show how
we can be confronted with
consumption decisions every
day. The way we consume
things as a matter of course
can be challenged by tracing
back the upstream and
downstream impacts of our
consumption decisions both
on the environment and
living things. For me, it is not
about choosing a radical
lifestyle and committing
myself to the abstinence
of all kinds of enjoyment.
The human being strives to
hedonism, social affiliation
and self-actualisation and the
consumption of the discussed
products and services makes
a contribution to satisfying
these needs. For me, it is
about starting to reflect our
manner of consuming things
and to find a balance between
uncontrolledconsumptionand
forgoing. There are numerous
and very easy approaches to
starting a more conscious and
sustainable consumption. If
you haven’t had a coffee yet
today, why not use a reusable
cup instead of throwing away
the paper cups each time?
Why not take the train from
time to time instead of the
plane for short distances?
Why not trying to repair the
hole in your jeans instead of
throwing it away or even look
for a more durable garment
next time?

Being Black
and Muslim
in the UK
Mohamed Omer discusses his
intersecting identities
T
he US is what
most of us think of
when we think of
Black Civil Rights,
which is where the
movement was the
most prominent, but seldom do
we realise or remember what
people in our own communities
go through. The recent race
row at Oxford University,
in which students received
an email from staff warning
them to be 'vigilant' because
a black graduate, Femi
Nylander, was seen walking
through college grounds, is
a true wake-up call. Another
investigation last January was
called at Cardiff University
after 32 undergraduates
were suspended from clinical
practice, after several others of
African heritage, complained
about a play performance
where a medical student
“blacked up” to impersonate
a lecturer. Suddenly the wake-
up call becomes an edgy,
\\ As a Black Muslim, I also
draw hope, optimism and
strength from my faith \\
max-volume Monday-morning
alarm. These are two of many
examples from the university
(Latin: universitas, "a whole")
scene – yet we’re supposed
to be on the side of New Year
where the grass is greener.
September 2017 sees the
launch of the Black Studies
course at Birmingham City
University, the first of its kind
in all of Europe. Given that
Black Studies has been a
part of US higher education
since campaigning during
the 1960s, the availability
of courses in the UK is long
overdue.
Campaigns such as Why is
my Curriculum White? show
that these hopes are mir-
rored by students. A survey
conducted in 2014 by the
NUS Black Students Cam-
paign found that, "42% did
not believe their curriculum
reflected issues of diversity,
equality and discrimination."
This did later lead to Univer-
sities Scotland producing the
race equality toolkit, Embed-
ding Race Equality into the
Curriculum, and OCR rolled
out a new module in GCSE
History called Migration to
Britain c. 1,000 to c. 2010,
highlighting early Black
presence in Britain. Steps for-
ward and yet we are moving
backwards – maybe we are
just moonwalking?
I personally believe debates
are won on the ground, with
grassroots activism and
with the patience to stand
face-to-face with your oppo-
nent, bear their insults, then
convince them that they were
mistaken.
The problem is, we have
some walls in our own social
structures. As a Black Muslim
myself, with a bristling black
beard, I really do feel locked
in a cage that contains me
and my painful silence. That
is, me speaking out would not
be seen as ‘grassroots activ-
ism’. Instead, I would simply
be lending to the stereotype
of an aggressive Black man
or terrorist. The most hurtful
of these experiences happen
when my mother is involved.
She may be driving along,
then as she looks over her
shoulder in that elegant
hijab, she would be met with
a terrifying racial slur from
the driver on the right. And
it’s so frustrating in those situ-
ations when I know I can’t do
anything about it. If you turn
to the driver and say “Hello
there”, he may accuse you
of blurting “Allahu Akbar”
(I have seen this happen to
others before, and so you just
do nothing.
But, as a Black Muslim, I
also draw hope, optimism
and strength from my faith.
Personally, I look to those
moments when my Prophet
Muhammad received
complaints from a Black
companion that another
companion made a racist
remark, so Muhammad
rebuked the offender “You
are a man in whom there
is some Jahiliyyah (igno-
rance)”. That transformative
power completely changed
the sentiments and views of
an entire nation within the
span of a 23 year struggle.
\\ For me, speaking

seen as 'grassroots
activism'. Instead,
I would simply

stereotye of an

man or terrorist \\
The culmination of this was
when Muhammad stood up
on Mount Arafah and deliv-
ered the famous Farewell
Sermon (included in the Folio
Book of Historic Speeches),
among the final few words
he imparted on the listeners
were:
“… An Arab has no superi-
ority over a non-Arab nor a
non-Arab has any superiority
over an Arab; also a white
has no superiority over black
nor a black has any superior-
ity over white except by piety
and good action.”
A most profound state-
ment, which we learnt from
our childhood days in the
mosque, and have never for-
gotten since. And the whole
story teaches me that no
matter how big the hurdle is,
with patience and persever-
ance any reform is possible.
Nowadays, there are those
who say religion belongs in
the past, but based on my
experiences, I can say that
my Islam is very relevant to
my blackness. It is a pool
of inspiration for me as a
Black man, and it provides a
timeless framework for how
people of all ethnicities can
come to know each other.
Mahatma Gandhi did say:
“When I closed the second
volume (of the Prophet’s
biography), I was sorry there
was not more for me to read
of that great life.”
Next week sees Imperial
ACS collaborating with ISoc
to explore the fascinating
relationship between Islam
and Black History during
Imperial's Discover Islam
Week.
