hat liberal hippie
sucktard, what’s he
talking about? This
is the best time to be
alive! Oil is beautiful,
coal is beautiful, gas
is beautiful (except the fart you
produce you skunk). We must
keep burning more, in fact, we
don’t burn enough fossil fuels.
Why should we waste our time
with all these useless renewable
energy projects? Screw the
sun and wind. Oil is the most
efficient way to power our
economy. It’s gonna boom!
is manly.
Scrap the Paris Agreement.
It’s a stupid thing and will make
manufacturing less competitive
and expensive. Also the French
are rude and smell of cheese.
Unbridled capitalism is the
engine of prosperity (for some
of us. The rest, not so much) and
this agreement was created by
dirty socialists who are jealous
of our success.
Now you ask me, but what
happens when we run out of
fossil fuels? Pfft, that’s like, 50
years into the future. Not my
problem. By the time we run out
of fuel we’ll have discovered a
way to go to the Moon or some-
thing. Short term greed over
long term planning? Hell yeah!
S
o here we stand
at the precipice of
world doom. Having
survived countless
wars, merciless
slaughter and wanton
brutality, we decided to boil
ourselves alive. All this is thanks
to Big Oil, which is thanks to Big
Corporate and Big Government,
which is thanks to the Illuminati
Freemason Zionist New World
Order created by Lizard-Men to
control us.
This is the time for the revo-
lution to occur. We must fight
back against the corporate
machines that enslaves us
and free ourselves from their
clutches. Oil is the biggest evil
of the world. We must stop
using oil in any form. No more
cars, no more buses, no more
electricity, nothing! No more
cooking oil either. That stuff is
unhealthy.
facts, only about how I feel
about things.
We must realise that all tech-
nology was invented to further
marginalise the common people.
The creative destruction of
millions of jobs was no accident,
but part of the Lizard plan to
make us more and more unnec-
essary until the time comes to
exterminate us. We will rage
against the machine, rage
against the dying light. Luddite,
Luddite, Luddite!
We shall return to the good
old days, living off the land and
using beasts of burden. We will
no longer be chained to the
concrete jungle. We will live in
perfect harmony with nature.
Granted without modern tech-
nology our entire civilisation will
fall apart and billions will die,
but for those of us who remain,
we shall live in paradise. Will
you join me?
Oil is literally the devil
(except Jojoba oil – I
love Jojoba oil)
Jian Li Chew will have no part in
this oil fueled genocide.
I want to run a bath
of crude oil – the
planet will be fine

You know what, even renewa-
ble energy should not be used
since wind turbines are ugly and
affect birds. Also nuclear power
is scary. You can tell me all the
facts about all the safeguards
built into the reactor and how
it is the only available easily
scaled up power source that
emits little greenhouse gases,
but then, I don’t care about

All this climate change hocus
pocus by dumb stupid scientists
is a huge hoax to get tons of
funding. Oil executives in fancy
suits say that climate change
isn’t real, and they have no
reason to lie. It snowed for
like fifteen minutes last Friday,
so all that climate rubbish is
disproven. I also think that the
decline of the coal industry is
awful. Bring back coal! Bring
back all the lost jobs! That black
smoke carries the sweet smell
of progress. But what about
the health effects? Just wear a
mask. Also, enduring pollution
