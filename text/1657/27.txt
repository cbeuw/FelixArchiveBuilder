H
ave you
ever said to
yourself “I love
basketball,
football and
rugby with a
passion but it would be a
dream to play them all at
once” ? Well then I have just
the thing for you. A sport for
those who fancy carrying
the ball like rugby, but prefer
a rounder shape. For those
who fancy bouncing it every
now and again, but also
want the luxury of booting it
into the net. A sport played
with enormous teams but on
suitably large pitches. I give
you, Gaelic football.
It’s a sport many have heard
of but very few play. As the
name suggests, it’s huge in
Ireland and is slowly starting
to leak onto our television
screens if you’re lucky enough
to have premium channels.
It incorporates numerous
elements from a number of
different sports, fulfilling my
promise above. 15 men take
to pitches larger than that
of rugby with two goals at
either end. These aren’t any
ordinary nets, but hybrid foot-
ball-rugby structures through
which points can be scored
by passing the ball into either
element. Players can carry
the ball in a similar fashion to
rugby, but must either bounce
or ‘solo’ it (kicking off the foot
back into the hands) every
four steps. You must advance
down the pitch, with very little
contact available to defend-
ers other than intercepting
or one-hand tackling, after
which attackers can make
an attempt on goal either
through the posts (one point)
or into the net (three points).
Simple right? Well, yeah it is
actually.
I mean no insult to those
who play, as with any sport
there are complex tactics
and strategies involved, but
this is mostly due to the lack
of tackling opportunities and
ease of movement over such a
large area. But this statement
isn’t made naively, I went to
a session in Hyde Park on a
wet Wednesday to try out this
classic Irish sport. Spoiler: I
may well be going again.
After a brief but tiring warm
up (I really need to get fit if
I’m going to continue these
give-it-a-go sessions) we’re
straight into some practice
drills. There are only a few
players at the session, but
there’s enough team spirit
and banter for three times
the numbers present. I’m
keen to add, and would be
remiss not to mention, that it
was a mixed session with no
segregation at all. Admit-
tedly only one female was
present, but she was given no
special treatment and rightly
so. I digress. The drills are
non-stop and comprehensive,
with clear aims and trans-
ferable skills. I am instantly
impressed with their ability
to run sessions with very little
equipment and space; even
those with little experience in
the sport can enjoy a good
fitness regime and improved
dexterity which I’m sure you’ll
agree are pivotal in most ball
games. Those who regularly
play football or rugby would
benefit from such a sport. Not
that I’m suggesting you moon-
light with Gaelic football but,
you know, you could.
We practice pass and
move, team communication
and sprint exercises. This is
followed by defender pur-
suits, where you learn how to
navigate the limited tackling
allowances within the game.
Here I can boast some suc-
cess, as I surprised the chap
running the session by twist-
ing and turning the defender
into a whirlwind of confusion.
There might be some embel-
lishment here but hey, I excel
at few sports so I’ll take the
win. It was soon overturned
when the roles were reversed,
as I let the defender get away
without even catching up to
him. Kind reprise or sluggish
running? You decide.
We soon move onto
half-pitch practice runs.
Split into defenders and
attackers, those running at
the goal practice manoeuvres
designed to draw the backs
out creating space for a
well-aimed punt between the
rugby-style posts or ideally, a
drill into the net. Once again,
new game. It’s a sport with
benefits for those who desire
to improve their fitness whilst
enjoying great team spirit.
You learn important off-the-
ball skills, like losing your
marker and creating space
on what can become a very
crowded pitch. Whilst chat-
ting with the other players,
I’m told other universities
invite other sports teams to
joint their practice sessions.
Rugby players would benefit
from improved ball-carrying
and footwork, footballers
would improve their shots on
goal under pressure and bas-
ketballers will… bounce more.
Anyway, here’s a sport that
encompasses multiple skills
and has a rich history within
the British Isles. The number
of people who turned up to
this session wouldn’t constitute
a full Gaelic team, a travesty
considering there are few
match commitments due to
a lack of teams around the
country. The benefits far out-
weigh the time commitments,
and all the skills you learn are
transferable to a variety of
scenarios. I’ve said it before
and I wholeheartedly mean it
again, go along and give this
a go. Amateurs have nothing
to worry about, seasoned
sports players have nothing
to lose.
\\ I hear whispers of
“Wow” around me,
but I’m sure it was
just the wind \\
I’m given the opportunity to
see if any Irish blood runs
through my veins. Placed in
the forward position, I move
with ballet-like grace around
the defenders. Ducking and
diving around the quagmire
we’ve lovingly called the
goal-mouth, I find some space
and the ball in my hand. I turn
towards the goal, set myself
up and blast it into the bottom
corner. I hear whispers of
“Wow” around me, but I’m
sure it was just the wind. I’m
absolutely loving this; I get
to relive past memories of
football which have slipped
away from me and learn a

a sport?
Of course!
After months
of intense
training, IC
Dance’s Ballroom and Latin
Dancesport teams travelled
to Cardiff last weekend
for a clash of the southern
universities. This is one of
the most eagerly anticipated
competitions of the year, a
crucial step before the UK-
wide competition in Blackpool
at the end of February. Vying
with universities as far as
Exeter and Southampton
(as well as the powerhouses
Cambridge and Oxford),
Imperial made an extremely
strong showing, with dancers
at all levels giving top-notch
performances.
Dancesport competition
operates on a unique knock-
out system. Couples are
categorised by ability and
from then on it is a battle to
remain on the floor – a panel
of judges ruthlessly eliminates
around half the competitors
during each round. Stamina is
therefore crucial. With each
round it becomes harder to
maintain the same energy
and sharpness, and yet the
pressure mounts as fewer and
fewer dancers remain.
For the IC Beginners team,
SUDC was only the second
major official competition
they had attended. Benjamin
Biggs and Kerys Borg stood
out with their phenomenal
performance in the beginners
category. Despite strong
competition from Oxford,
Cambridge and Cardiff, they
beat 68 other couples to
emerge as champions in both
ballroom categories, waltz
and quickstep. Amazingly,
Ben and Kerys did it all over
again in the Latin competi-
tions, winning both jive and
cha for a clean sweep of four
first place medals! An abso-
lutely stellar performance
from this promising beginner
couple.
Of the more advanced cou-
ples, many were competing
together for the first time last
weekend. IC Dance lost sev-
eral dancers to injuries and
other commitments after Not-
tingham Varsity in November,
forcing a reshuffle of dancers
on the team. Undeterred by
the limited time they had to
practice, the newly-minted
couples did remarkably well
on the floor. Devon Anthony
and Stephanie Rathmann
came in fourth in Novice
Ballroom despite being
partners for little more than a
month. Meanwhile, Barnaby
Paul and Anastassia Rajapu
deserve a special mention for
making it to the semifinals of
Novice Latin with what must
be the record for the shortest
preparation time ever – their
routines were made up on the
day itself!
First and third places in
Novice Latin were claimed
by Imperial couples: Oliver
Jiang and Mariya Pozdeyeva
were the undisputed champi-
ons, with an unanimous top
rank from every judge on
the panel – an event almost
unprecedented in the often
hotly contested finals. Junyi
Hou and Sarah McMullan
were neck and neck with a
couple from Exeter but were
narrowly edged out for a
commendable third.
At the Intermediate level,
Devon Anthony and his Latin
partner Freya Thomas seized
their first competition win at
SUDC last weekend with their
skill in cha, jive and paso
doble. They are a well-es-
tablished partnership; both
started dancing as beginners
in IC Dance two years ago
and placed sixth in Novice
Latin at Inter-Varsity after
partnering up last year. Since
then they have gone from
strength to strength.
Contrasting them in Interme-
diate Ballroom were Sirawit
Ittisoponpisan and Yue Shi,
who have only been dancing
together since December.
They faced off against five
couples from Cambridge (and
one Bristolian couple) in the
finals to come in fifth place
in waltz, Viennese waltz and
quickstep.
In Advanced Latin, Tianci
Ma & Adela Capilnasiu
nabbed yet another first place
for Imperial, triumphing over
eleven other couples with
their excellent performance
in four dances: cha, rumba,
paso doble and jive. Slavina
Georgieva, an Imperial
alumna, and her partner
ballroom partner Sarah
McMullan also competed
in Acrobatic Rock N’ Roll,
coming in sixth with their
effortless stunts and energetic
dancing.
Finally, the day concluded
with the team match: each
participating university sends
several teams of four couples,
who dance separately in
waltz, quickstep, cha and jive.
They are judged together and
progress through the rounds
as though they are a single
couple. Unlike the previous
events where individual
couples compete against
each other, the team match
is where universities go head
to head on the dance floor.
After four intense rounds of
dancing, Imperial’s A team
came in fourth out of 33
teams representing universi-
ties at SUDC. Well done to
the dancers of the A team!
The whole IC Dance team
can be proud of their achieve-
ments at SUDC this year.
Meanwhile anticipation is
building for the Inter-Varsity
Dance Competition, when
the Northern and Southern
universities will convene for
the largest competition of the
year! Best wishes to IC Dance
as they gear up for IVDC next
weekend.

Henry Hesten also made
fifth place in the gruelling
Advanced Latin (Ex-students)
category, which assesses cou-
ples’ prowess in all five Latin
dances – the aforementioned
4 and an additional dance,
samba.
