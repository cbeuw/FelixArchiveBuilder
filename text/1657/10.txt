A
s a director on
the executive
board of the
Network of
Sustainable
Scientists and
Engineers (NESSE) and a
PhD student in the Chemistry
Department funded via the
Grantham Institute, it may
appear as though my future
career path in sustainable
science is all but decided.
This, however, is far from true.
Sustainable science
has been defined as “an
emerging field of research
dealing with the interactions
between natural and social
systems, and with how
those interactions affect the
challenge of sustainability”.
My desire to pursue a career
in sustainable science post-
PhD, and to ensure that
my research efforts have a
‘wider impact’, outside my
niche area of chemistry, is
as strong as ever. However,
the challenges facing early
career sustainable scientists
in their quest to begin this
career path are complex .
Now, in the third year of my
PhD, I have begun to explore
these challenges along with
Alexandra Hicken talks to colleagues from the Network of Sustainable Scientists about the
challenges that complicate a career in sustainable science.
Lack of a clear career
path to follow |
Cristiano Verrone,
Postdoctoral Researcher,
DTU, Denmark
Working in a lab, it is
possible to be in control
of the outcome of my own
work and this predictability
can be nice. In contrast,
perhaps the most troubling
thing facing researchers who
wish to embark in a career
in sustainable science is its
unpredictable nature – it is
not currently clear what a
career in sustainable science
actually entails. "In other
scientific disciplines, PhD
students can easily move
into industrial research,
academia or even unrelated
fields such as banking, with
the path they need to follow
to achieve these goals being
well defined. However, this is
not the case with sustainable
science. In order to have
real impact, it’s important for
sustainable scientists to be
able to advise professionals
in the public and private
sectors whilst still being able
to perform interdisciplinary
research. This ‘dream sce-
nario’ almost certainly does
not currently exist for early
career researchers and as
such, it is difficult to know
what steps to take after finish-
ing PhD research.
A challenge is the inter-
and transdisciplinarity
in sustainable science
| Daniel Pleissner,
Assistant Professor,
Leuphana University of
Lüneburg, Germany
Due to the complex prob-
lems the world is currently
facing, such as an ever
increasing population and
rising levels of pollutants, nei-
ther physical and natural nor
social scientists possess the
skills needed to tackle these
challenges in discrete groups.
But sadly, training in the form
of research is usually given in
very niche areas and so PhD
students are rarely equipped
with the skills to be truly
interdisciplinary researchers.
The long time needed for
the impact of such research
to manifest itself, at least in
terms of citations, further
complicates things, despite its
broad social and economic
impacts. This discrepancy
could be mitigated through
ensuring that interdisciplinary
teams of researchers exist to
tackle problems together and
more importantly, through
making funding available
to such teams from research
councils.
Limited role models
and lack of respect for
sustainable science field
in traditional science
settings| Natalie
O’Neil, PhD Student,
University at Albany
State, USA
Many people chose a spe-
cific career path as a result
of the influence of a strong
role model. But in sustainable
sciences there appears to be
no one to contact for advice
or support. This lack of role
models in sustainable science
is cause for concern for early
career researchers. Addition-
ally, sustainable sciences are
often viewed as a ‘watered
down’ version of science,
especially from researches
in ‘pure’ scientific disciplines.
This further intensifies the feel-
ing of a lack of support from
supervisors or the department
that they are researching in
order to continue with sustain-
able science research.
Fortunately, for many early
career sustainable scientists,
the desire to continue along
a career path that may be ill
defined and treacherous, but
allows them to work towards
achieving a sustainable future,
is still strong. Working together
with other researchers and
professionals as well as
joining networks to promote
sustainable science through
all scientific disciplines is one
way they can ensure that this
is the case. Personally, it is
important that I play a role in
the promotion of sustainable
sciences either through my
research in the chemistry
department, or through
extra-curricular work as a
volunteer for a sustainable
science network. Over the
coming weeks, NESSE will be
conducting research into the
experiences of early-career
researchers wishing to do
sustainable science in order to
see what can be done to help.
This will lead to NESSE being
able to support early-career
sustainable scientists in order
to ensure that the challenges
they face aren’t faced alone.
