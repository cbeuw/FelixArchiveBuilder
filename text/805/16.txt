The teachers were the same as ever.
Perhaps slightly greyer, and more
tired looking, more furrows on the
brow, but bearing welcoming smiles
and being sure to remember
everyone's name. 'How are you;
Stephanie?' How's it going, Melissa?'
They proffered glasses of wine on
trays. This recognition of our passage
into adulthood, since leaving school
three years ago, concerned us.
Alcohol was not a thing associated
with school common-rooms, except
under giggly secrecy at end-of-term
parties, and the notion of the teachers
actually condoning our alcohol
consumption was a curious one.
Needless to say, we didn't refuse, sat
back on the fading, jaded Habitat
furniture, so pristine and new in our
memories, and, sipping wine and
munching sausage rolls, observed the
friends and enemies of bygone days.
'There's Fiona, Doesn't she look a
sight?'
T wonder if RosalindTl turn up?'
T think Danielle looks nice. I wish
my hair would go like that.'
'Corinne hasn't changed—just as
tarty as ever.'
'Do you think Andrea'll come with
the baby?'
The arrival of a teacher, smiling
ingratiatingly and hovering
apologetically as if not wishing to
intrude, yet desperately desirous of
our conversation, forced us to break
the knot of sharp cynical observation.
We exchanged pleasantries, yes, yes,
we'd loved being at university, well,
yes, we were sad to leave, no, we
were glad we were not continuing
with postgraduate studies—and then,
well, it had to come, the dreaded
Question—what were we going to do
now?
Kate piped up first. It was fairly
easy for her. 'I'm having a year out
and going to Australia,' she said. 'I'm
saving up for my air fare.' This was
a lie from the start. No doubt she
would accrue about fifty pounds, the
rest to be paid by her father. 'I'll get
a job when I get there, and I've got
some relatives in Melbourne...' She
chattered away happily and we seized
advantage of this to move away from
the kind yet inquisitive approaches of
another staff member.
They were all there, the tall, the
short, the thin, the fat, the pretty and
the ugly, in the same cliques as ever.
I suppose we were just the same, but
whereas the others held court in the
centre of the room, we clung to the
walls, content merely to observe
before we in turn had to be observed.
They all had their futures mapped out,
this great clan of smartly-dressed,
pearl-beaded young ladies, with their
striped shirt collars upturned,
THE QUESTION
perching on the edge of their seats,
ignoring all the free food and drink
that was the prime reason for our
presence. 'Sindy dolls'—that was
what we used to calf them, and I
despised them still, with their
excessively pretty names—Lucinda,
Anne-Marie, Corelia, Francesca,
Yvette—and their silly, affected
manners—'Jo-Jo! How nice to see
you!' and lots of hugging and
embracing. The fact that Jo-Jo and
Lu-Lu were bosom companions and
had probably seen each other virtually
every day since the end of term was
irrelevant. But their futures were
certain—they had chosen sensible
degree courses, and were to be
dentists, lawyers, physiotherapists,
economists. They knew how to
answer that dreaded Question.
There were others, of course, but
they weren't here, most of them. The
'failures' and rejects, the office-girls
and shop assistants, Liz who worked
in a printer's, Louise who was a cook
in the Army, Pauline w worked
alternately in a pub and chippy
on the seafront, and, of course,
Andrea with the baby.
They couldn't satisfactorily answer
the Question, so they hadn't come.
But, to the school, they were failures,
they hadn't gone into higher
education, or, if they had, they had
dropped out. We' weren't failures,
we'd got our degrees—but what else?
We couldn't answer the Question.
What would we do with our lives? At
least most of the 'failures' drove
smart cars and could afford to go out
most nights.
'Of course, some of the people here
must be lesbians, you know.'
'Well—girls. According to the
national average, there should be
three lesbians from our year.'
'Three?'
'How do you know?'
We'd never really considered this
possibility before. Of course, there
was the Home Economics teacher
who shared a country cottage with the
Games mistress; our adolescent minds
had concluded that homosexuality
was therefore rife in their household,
and tht the Games mistress, who
made us run once round the hockey
HIGH COUNTRY
The wind has teeth
And in its bite I feel my folly
Ahead, far in the cloaking mist,
Far, as my faint heart tells me,
The hill men go;
That special lucky breed
As if by right race up
Forbidden crags, and little dream
That some
Feel every step a privilege
And every clawing hold
A prize hard earned
And proudly count each
Small horizon won.
And yet we have something
In common—the high country
Calls, like the fatal siren
Hiding her peril with her charms.
In truth the hills lack
All the lushness, the easy
Grace of sweet fields rolling
Tame from town to town.
Steep crags, they show; proud rock
That dares the solitary fool
To try his strength.
And deep within me that
Strong lure strikes strong response
So that some crazy part
Of me cries out 'Go on,' though
Muscles creak, and sane mind fears
Oblivion. But on the peaks
With frozen flesh but heart
Flushed warm with selfless love,
I think back to the city's
Press of people and I know
That what I have to fear is not
The high ground, but the low
Keya Schmiechen.
field for every item of kit we left
behind, obviously 'wore the trousers'.
The possibility that two spinsters
might share a beautiful residence for
companionship and sound economic
sense simply did not interest us.
But the idea that some of our
contemporaries could be was a new
one. Would it interfere with their
career prospects? Was there anything
about it in the Hippocratic Oath?
What if a prospective client found
out?
It didn't matter to us, anyway. The
desultory conversation and snide
speculation were fun, but the ultimate
outcome was the same. They could
answer the Question—some were
currently doing so, smiling prettily,
preening their hair, digging their heels
into the carpet and chatting politely—
and we couldn't. This wasn't our
scene. We decided to leave. Hastily
consuming a last pizza square, we
delved beneath a mountain of green
waxed 'Country Jackets' for our
coats, said the goodbyes... .then went
down the pub.
