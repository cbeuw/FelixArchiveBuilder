SCORES
Under 10: Well, one thing's for
certain—you're no fish finger. It's a
bit difficult to say exactly what you
are really. To be blunt, you'd put a
train-spotter to shame. My
recommendation is that you apply for
a job on IC Radio.
10-20: Yes, you're one of life's losers
as well. All you think about is
yourself. You're an egotistical, selfish
bastard. Why not apply for the job of
ICU President?
21-30: Congratulations! Join the fish
finger club. You're prime 100% cod
material. You can probably think of
nothing better than sitting on a plate
of peas, chips and grease. Captain
Birdseye would be proud of you.
Above 30: You're clever, cunning
with a crude sense of humour. You're
also either a bloody liar or a hopeless
mathematician since it's impossible to
score more than 30.
Mama Italia—Part 1
A torrid tale of Venus & Mars
The best tortellini in Italy can be
enjoyed only in Bologna and Modena.
It will always be handmade. The pasta
is rolled out into big sheets and cut
into rectangular patches. A specially
prepared stuffing is placed in the
middle of each rectangle which is
folded into shape to fit the navel of
Venus—the Goddess of Love, Sex
and the Joy of Life. So, when you
men eat the exquisite tortellini
imagine that it has been graced by
Venus, if you are a woman think of
the torrid Mars (God of War) as
Venus would no doubt have done
while eating this creation.
Venice
IC's resident expert on many aspects
of Italian gastronomy warns that
Venice is the classic tourist trap over
the summer months. The expensive
restaurants are out of the range of
most students but are the only ones
that maintain high culinary standards.
The other establishments raise their
prices but lower their standrads.
I suggest that you eat sandwiches
for lunch and go to 'terra ferma' to
have dinner. Venice is connected to
Mestre by a bridge. Take a bus and
go to a trattoria in Mestre. Those who
insist on eating in Venice should try
the trattorias in Guidecca (the former
Jewish quarter). This quarter is
located in the island across the water
from San Marco's Square and is
clearly visible in the distance.
Guidecca is relatively unspoilt by
tourists and the prices will be lower.
Special tips
'Do Ferni' (the two ovens) is
recommended for those willing to
spend £25 per head, you will undergo
an adventure in Venetian cuisine
involving 10-15 courses of fish
dishes. You can expect a mussel dish
and spaghetti perscatora (fisherman's
style spaghetti) amongst the courses.
Universal points
Buying icecream—The best icecream
can be got at places that display the
Gelateria Artigianle or Produzione
Propria signs. It would be wise to go
to places which only sell icecream.
Drinking coffee—It might be worth
pointing out that Italians drink
Capuccino for breakfast and Expresso
after dinner. The term 'cafe
macchieto' should be used when
requesting coffee with a drop of milk.
Ordering wine— 'Vino de la Cassa'
will be the cheapest wine you will be
able to order to accompany your food.
This will be decanted into a carafe
then served to you. Never accept any
other wine that is not uncorked in
front of you.
Eating in a pizzaria—This
magnificent creation of Italian
cooking must be cooked in an oven
fired by wood. The places where you
get take-away pizzas will be using
electric ovens mostly. Those seeking
the authentic pizza experience should
only eat at establishments where one
can see the 'Pizzaiolo' preparing the
pizzas and using a wood fired oven.
Seasonal dishes—Cook out for
'Rissoto con i Bruscandoli' when
eating in a trattoria. This rissoto dish
uses a wild vegetable gathered in
June/July.
A trattoria—Trattorias are often run
by a family. You will find plenty of
opportunity to sample what is
effectively home cooking. A wide
selection of dishes cooked to a good
standard can be expected.
Recipe by special request
ROGAN JOSH
This familiar Indian meat dish is a
classic that is easy to prepare. Its
secret lies in the reddish colour
developed from the paprika and the
slightly sour taste of the yogurt.
I have been requested to include
more recipies. Two people in Holbein
House asked that I include my Rogan
Josh recipe which has been admired
by a number of people.
Ingredients
2lbs boned lamb cut into cubes
'A pint of water or chicken stock
Vi pint of whole milk set yogurt
Spices: 2-3 bay leaves, 6-10
cloves, 2 large cinamon sticks, 2
black cardomom pods (optional), 1
heaped tsp cummin seeds, 5 tsp
paprika, 1-2 tsp chilli powder, 1.5
tsp garram massala.
8 cloves garlic
1 inch piece of ginger
3 medium size onions.
Method
Chop the garlic and ginger very finely
or blend them with a little water into
a paste. Chop the onions finely. Grind
the cummin seeds. Fry the lamb
pieces in vegetable oil until lightly
brown. Remove from the frying pan.
Heat up a little oil, add the bay leaves,
cloves, cinnamon and cardomom
pods. Fry until the bay leaves change
colour and the cloves swell up. Add
the cummin, immediately followed by
the onions. Fry on medium heat until
all the onions become soft. Add the
ginger and garlic and continue the
frying. Add the fried lamb cubes and
fry for a few minutes. Lower the
flame. Add a little yogurt and
continue stirring. Add more and more
yogurt gradually until all of it has
blended in with the sauce. Add the
paprika, chilli powder and chicken
stock or water. Bring to the boil,
simmer the meat for Vi hours stirring
intermittantly. Examine the thickness
of the sauce. Remove the lid of the
pot if it is looking water. Continue
simmering until the lamb is tender.
Never thicken the sauce by vigorous
boiling but by gentle reduction.
Add the garam massala a few
minutes before serving this dish with
some rice. Add salt and freshly
ground pepper to taste.
I would like to dedicate this article to
Luca Zullo. Thanks to him a number
of pasta and risotto dishes will always
be served at my dinner table. I hope
this article managed to reflect the love
Luca managed to convey to me when
talking about Italian food.
Next week
The gastronomic survey takes a look
at eating in Verona, Florence and
Rome.
Ciou,
Yishu.
