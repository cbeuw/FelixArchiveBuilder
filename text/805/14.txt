TWO DAYS
IN THE LIFE
The story starts on a Saturday
morning, and it starts badly, as for
once my body clock failed me, and
I didn't wake until almost eleven—
disgracefully late. This, and the recent
demise of an affair of the heart which •
had been inconclusive from day one
left me bleary, and rather depressed,
so after breakfast I decided to go to
Camden Market to cheer myself up,
and for the sake of the exercise I
decided to walk from Fulham. As an
additional pick-me-up, I put on my
new leather jacket and black 501s, as
dressing in glad rags usually helps my
moods.
All went well until somewhere near
the top of Oxford Street, when my
mind wandered and my feet followed
it—I wound up in the Aldwych on the
steps of St Clement Danes. This part
of the City is very quiet and lonely
on a Saturday afternoon, and did my
mood no good at all; I couldn't help
thinking of the unfortunate Dane who
got nailed to the door of the then St
Clements. I expect he didn't like the
Aldwych either.
With the directions of a passing
copper I found Camden, and went for
a wander, finally ending up in the
Zipper store on the high street where
I spent too much money on a rather
nice tee-shirt with a very sexy man
on it, and the message, T can resist
anything except temptation'. Then
began the sequence of events which
led to my downfall. I remembered a
friend I hadn't seen for a long time
who lived close by, and decided to
pay him a visit. He was pleased to see
me, and after a few drinks he and his
boyfriend asked me out for the night.
The booze made me careless—I
agreed.
The evening started well. We did
the rounds of the gay pubs in
Camden, and towards eleven we
headed into the West End, and to a
club called Napoleon's. This is very
exclusive, and very expensive—it is
the place where well heeled, middle
aged City Queens go to drink the
night away. Being the youngest man
in a gay club is rather exhilerating,
and oh boy did I live it up. I danced
like a dervish until 2am, drank
enough to rupture my liver, and got
chatted up by the pianist, an engaging
man in his thirties who called me
Darling.
I finally left Napoleon's at about
2.30, woozy and alone, and set
myself to walk back to Fulham. My
memory is perfect until I reached
South Kensington, but after that there
is a blank, at the end of which—to my
utter self-disgust—I woke up at
4.30am in a strange bed with someone
I didn't know, and had to ask him the
worst question of all: 'What's your
name?'.
I got home at dawn, still drunk and
feeling physically and mentally
soiled, had a bath and went to bed.
My body clock has an odd sense of
humour—it woke me punctually at
6.30. Sober at last, but completely
ashamed of myself, I dressed and
walked up to Hyde Park, and spent
the morning smoking and watching
the geese on the Long Water. It was
early in the afternoon when I got up
to leave, still feeling lousy. I turned
toward the Albert Hall, and saw
something which stopped me in my
tracks, and made me forget all my
troubles as if they had never existed.
In front of me stood an old man,
shabbily dressed. He could only
mumble at the passes by, and my
heart went out to him, living in his
lonely world for one. As I watched,
he extended his arms above his head,
and spread his fingers apart, giving
an odd little chirruping whistle, and
to my complete astonishment
sparrows started to appear and perch
on his hands, first by ones and twos,
and then in tens, until he looked like
a large impression of a scarecrow. A
small group of people gathered to
watch him, at first completely silent
until a little boy gave a gurgling
laugh, and clapped his hands in
admiration. The old man turned his
face to us, a king crowned with
sparrows, and slowly broke into such
a gentle, happy smile that it made you
grin to see him.
Even in the lowest days of my life
to come, I know I will remember that
moment. I don't think I can ever be
depressed again without seeing the
vision in my head of the old King of
the Birds, and the little boy that
laughed.
