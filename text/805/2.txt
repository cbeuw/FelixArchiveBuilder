This week's FELIX may seem
unusually big for this time of year but
it's only because we've cheated and
inserted the last issue of the Phoenix •
into the middle. Due to a U G M cock
up. no papers went up for the election
of next year's Phoenix Editor. Liz,
the present Editor, is very keen to
meet anyone who is remotely
interested in working on the Phoenix
next year. She can be contacted via
the Life Science pigeonholes.
Wot no Welfare?
I realised the other night that I needed
to talk to somebody about my
accommodation situation next year.
In the good old days I would have
gone straight to the College Welfare
Adviser, who would cheerily
provided me with answers to all my
questions. However, College no
longer has a Welfare Adviser. I rang
up the Student Accommodation Office
to ask if anybody there could help me
with my problems. They suggested
Don Adlington. the Student
Councellor—but it wasn't that sort of
problem. I didn't want to discuss my
problem with any old person in the
Accommodation Office because they
don't have the time to listen to my
minor queries when they're running
around trying to house two thousand
students. The Union also has no
Welfare Officer. Welfare Officers
have a tendancy to get disgruntled
with the lack of support they receive
from College and the Union and
decide to resign.
A long, long, long time ago the
Welfare Adviser used to work from
the Union Building but some bright
spark moved him into Prince's
Gardens and created 'Student
Services'.
For four years we had the situation
where Student Services (now called
the Student Accommodation Office)
was the effective landlord for 1800
students and at the same time was the
place you had to go to if you had any
queries or problems with your
landlord. At least there was someone
to talk to then! Now there is a void
which still has to be filled, despite
being highlighted in FELIX three
weeks ago.
If we are going to make the Union
more 'user friendly' perhaps it's time
to take back the Welfare Adviser for
ourselves and start concentrating on
really helping the students of
Imperial.
The Last Issue
We are currently preparing the last
edition of FELIX, which is due to be
published on Wednesday 22nd June.
If you want to submifletters for this
edition, the deadline is still Tuesday
lunchtime the week before (14th
June). Now's the time to let me know
if you are writing a feature or an
opinion so I can reserve you some
space.
I'm very keen to receive more
opinion articles. H G Wells is quoted
on page three this week. That was his
opinion of Imperial College in 1934
so what's yours in 1988?
Bound Editions
Last year's bound editions are going
to be picked up from the book binders
today. If you've paid your deposit,
you can collect your edition anytime
from about 4pm onwards.
This year's bound editions will be
sent off at the end of July. I estimate
that they will cost in the region of £ 3 0
to bind. It sounds a great deal of
money, but a bound edition of FELIX
makes excellent reading when you're
old and grey and telling the
grandchildren about the good old days
at Imperial.
Summer T-Shirts
We've ordered some more t-shirts
with a wacky new summer design on
to coincide with the last edition of
FELIX. So don't leave College before
Wednesday 22nd June!
Staff Photo
This will be taken on the steps leading
up to the Royal Albert Hall at 1.15pm
on Friday 10th June. Anybody who
has contributed in any way to FELIX
this year is welcome to turn up. Be
there or be left out!
Summer Printing
If you are a Club Publicity Officer
next year and you want any Fresher
publicity printed during September,
contact next year's FELIX Editor Bill
Goodwin via his pigeonhole in the
FELIX Office.
CVs
We can still typeset your CV in the
FELIX Office for a small sum. See
me, preferably on Mondays or
Fridays in the FELIX Office if you
want to use this service.
