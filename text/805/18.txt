TREMIUM
AND THE
'My God!' excalimed L , as the
bandaged figure burst into the room
and collapsed in the leather armchair.
'Oh. it's you. Premium. Are you
alright?'
L. the elegantly middle-aged head
of the Women's Special Secret
Service WI5. bent over the sprawled
figure of top agent single 0-1.
Premium Blonde. Whenever danger
threatened, the coveted single 0-1
prefix licensed her to kiss for her
country's honour!
'Not really.' said Premium. 'I've
got a week's sleept to catch up on.
And it's difficult to hear properly
through these head bandages. That
Red Rostov—the randy Russian
bear—caught me a dreadful clout
across the ear with his claws before
1 killed him. I smothered him with
Raisa's best fur coat! Still, I'm
recovering by the hour. I rushed back
here because of the new crisis. Oh,
but I'm tired.'
'Thank heavens you've back alive,'
said L. i want to her all about Red
Rostov later—but the new problem
has already defeated single 0-2 and
single 0-4.'
'Don't tell me Ursula and Brigit are
dead?'
'No, Premium, Not dead, but
they've been turned into religious
fanatics, like thousands of other
previously sane people. And they're
quite irrational. By the way, did you
order the usual resorative on arrival?
Good. Ah yes. do come, in Mr
Cashpound. That's right, two blue-
blooded Margarets. That will be all,
thank you.'
L picked up a large tumbler for
herself and gave Premium the other.
'How well the Parfiat d'Amour
goes with gin,' said L, relaxing for
a moment. 'And such a pretty
mauvey-blue colour—it matches your
eyes, Premium. Now, what have you
heard of our latest troubles?'
'With these bandages, hardly
anything. But I got the RAF boys at
Brize Norton to fill me in when my
plane landed this morning. It seems
that a fairly large spaceship of
unknown origin touched down in
Hyde Park yesterday, while I was still
in Moscow. As it went undetected by
our defence systems, its technology
must be way ahead of ours.'
'Yet no one—or nothing—has
emerged from it since it landed. Or
nothing visible. I should say,' added
L.
.'The Russians were as surprised as
the British,' Premium informed her.'
They do not believe that any nation
on Earth could have launched a
spaceship undetected by their
satellites, or landed one here without
triggering all the early warning
systems. And if we're up against little
men from space—and I hope they are
men—then my usual seduction
technique will be of no avail.'
She smoothed the rumpled red,
white and blue miniskirt down over
her gold tights, then continued: T
suppose the technical boys have
monitored the ship by all possible
methods?'
'Yes. it's no discharging any kind
of detectable vapour, either from
chemical fuels or biological activity.
Neither is it transmitting
electronically, although it is picking
up all kinds of TV wavelengths from
the air.'
'Poor devils if they've got nothing
better to do than to watch that trash,'
muttered Premium, pushing a stray
lock of blond hair back under the
bandages. 'But how did they turn 0-2
and 0-4 into religious fanatics if the
ship is inactive? Do speak up a bit too,
please.'
'Ah, we didn't let the media
transmit, this, but just before the ship
landed, it ejected a whole lot of small
packages over London. Each
contained a Walkman-type portable
cassette player, complete with
batteries and tape. Not realising that
they came from space, people picked
them up and used them. They play
some kind of percussive pop music
and turn the listeners into zombies.'
'What's new about that?' asked
Premium, finishing her bloody-
Margaret with an appreciative swig.
'Have we had one of these tapes
analysed?'
'Several—they are all the same, but
one of the Q Branch girls, Cathering
Goodeve, was converted while
listening druing the analysis. She's
under close observation and keeps
talking abot the second coming!'
'The second coming?' Premium
exclaimed. 'Christ!'
'Christ is not known to travel by
spaceship,' said L drily. 'These
zombies don't seem dangerous yet,
but that might be part of a careful plan
to fool us, and to divert attention away
from the spaceship. The converts
preach a sort of low-grade, simplified
Christianity—the kind of thing an
American Bible-puncher might
broadcast to less educated people. But
it is all rather garbled. The oscilloscpe
analysis of the tapes shows interesting
high and low frequency subliminal
signals amongst the pop music, but
no one can see how they work.'
'Can I interview Christine?' asked
Premium.
'Yes—not if you like. The converts
don't seem able to recruit others
directly, fortunately for us. If the
spaceship starts to broadcast such
signals, we're ready to jam them
immediately. The PM agreed to
provide the most powerful jamming
transmitters the army has got, because
she doesn't want any bunch of aliens
spoiling her third term of office.'
Twenty minutes later. Premium and
her boss returned to L's office. As
they passed Mr Cashpound's desk,
Premium noticed the wistfully
admiring looks he gave her over his
encrypto-typewriter.
'Another blue-blooded Margaret?'
he suggested.
'Yes, please,' said L, firmly
ushering 0-1 into her office as
Premium blew a kiss to Mr
Cashpound.
'Well,' asked L. 'What did you
make of the convert? She said more
or less the same when I saw her
earlier. What on earth does she want
pictures of pale roses for, and why
does she ask how much money we
gain? And what has it got to do with
religion?'
Premium hardly seemed to hear L's
deep contralto voice, as her mind
grasped at straws.
Suddenly she raised her head ans
asked:
'Do you know what homonyms are,
L?'
'No—something to do with men if
it starts with "homo" and interests
you. Perhap's men's names?'
'Wrong this time, L. "Homonym'
comes from the Greek homos, alike,
not from the Latin homo, man.
Homonyms are words having the
same sound but different meanings.
They may be spelled the same or
differently. It those aliens intercepted
TV and radio signals from here as
they approached Earth, they might
know only the sounds of our words,
and could easily confuse words of the
After a short visit to Q section, who
fitted a small two-way radio under her
head bandages, Premium was driven
in an unmarked car to Hyde Park
Corner where she joined the crowd
of curious onlookers. She worked her
way up Park Lane, which had been
closed to traffic, until she reached the
cordon of soldiers and police
surrounding the alien ship.
'Strictly no one to be allowed
through, that's our orders,' said the
harassed young sergeant. He blushed
as Premium stroked his smooth pink
cheek with her fingers. She showed
him her special WI5 pass with the
other hand.
T i l have to check with
headquarters,' he said, putting his
hand to his radio.
'You will not!' ordered Premium.
'Don't you realise tht the aliens
monitor all our radio signals and
understand our language? This pass
permits me to go anywhere, without
question.'
The sergeant draw back in
confusion as Premium's carmine lips
same sound and different meaning.
Being more advanced than, us, they
have probably got rid of such
confusions from their own language
and might not expect them in ours.'
'Ah, then they could have put the
wrong message on the tapes prepared
for use on Earth? Good thinking, yes
do come in, Cashpound, just leave the
tray there please. Thank you. Go on,
Premium.'
'With these wretched head
bandages, I've misheard quite a lot of
similar-sounding words in the lat two
days. That made me think about
homonyms and near-homonyms.
Religious fanatic's obsession with

pictures of pale roses could arise if
the aliens instructed he to seek out the
prints of peace, the rose, instead of
the Prince of Peace, meaning Christ.
Similarly, she could have been told
to worship the profits, instead of the
Prophets. That mind-numbing pop
music could stop the listeners from
finding these errors for themselves.'
'That's so absurd that it just has to
be true, Premium! So what do you
think the aliens are after?'
'They could be trying to raise
religious consciousness, to make sure
of a friendlier rectpion when they
emerge—my instincts tell me it's not
an unmanned probe. Perhaps they aim
to use religion as a tool of power, as
many humans have done before. If
they can turn people like Catherine
into zombies with one tape, you can
imagine what more thorough
conditioning could do. Then again, it
really could be Christ's second
coming, in a form appropriate for
20th century man—but I doubt it.'
'And what do you suggest we do
next, single 0-1?'
'When I've finished my drink, I
think I'l pay a social call on those
aliens. These mental efforts exhaust
me—I'm a woman of action at heart.'
H i
approached his thin moustache.
She dasehd past, vaulting the metal
barrier in one easy movement.
Ignoring the shouts from behind, she
darted ahead towards the sleek
cylinder, which stood vertically on its
four tail fins near Speaker's Corner.
Its smooth surface gleamed in the pale
April sun.
The crowd watched in awe as she
siowed down, walking casually but
gracefully towards the two hundred
foot high space ship.
Whe she was only a few feet away,
she raised her open hands in a friendly
gesture and called out:
'You are welcome here, aliens. I
salute the prints of Peace and worship
the Profits. I come without weapons
to talk to you, to find out the purpose
of your mission and how we can help.
We know that you understand spoken
English and come from a very
advanced civilisation. Let us talk
peace together, face to face, if your
bodies and mine can live in the same
atmosphere.'
A gasp went up from the astonished
crowd as a panel near the base of the
ship slid noiselessly back. A
shimmering silver ladder was lowered
to the ground, emerging from the
darkness within.
Keeping her two-way radio
switched off in case its activity was
detected by the aliens, Premium
scrambled nimbly up the ladder. Her
red, white and blue miniskirt fluttered
gently in the breeze.
She strode boldly into the dark
hold, peering into its gloomy
recesses. The door closed quietly
behind her, cutting off any retreat.
'Greetings,' she called into the utter
darkness. 'Greetings and peace.
Welcome to our visitors from outer
space.'
Her heart hammered at her ribs as
she waited for a response. His now
clammy hands toyed with her
bandages, through which she could
just hear the distant him of
machinery.
'Greetings, single 0-1!'
Premium looked up, startled by the
deep yet mechanical voice. It came
from a long way up, in the total
blackness.
Suddenly a screen lit up brightly,
a few feet above her head. The image
faltered for a moment, then focussed
in brilliant colour.
The image was of herself.
Aghast, Premium watched a slow-
motion replay of herself addressing
the police sergeant. The frame froze
for a moment as she flourished her
pass. A zoom enlargement showed
every word crystal-clear on that pass.
'I'll have to check with
headquarters,' she heard the
policeman say.
The film showed her almost kissing
the officer, and even she had to
admire the graceful way in which her
image vaulted the grey metal barrier.
'Yes, Premium,' said the alien.
'Our vocal and visual monitoring all
round the ship is quite effective, at
least where we have direct line of
sight. You have now been checked
from all angles.'
She blushed,pushing her skirt closer
gainst her thighs, as the film ended
with her ascent of the ladder.
Darkness returned.
T think you might prefer some
light,' continued the metallic tones,
'so let therebe light.Our purpose is
peaceful, not hostile. We admire you
for approaching us so openly, even
against the wishes of your
government's polic/ force. Any
military threat against us would be
very foolish, as our weapons and
defences are infinitely superior.'
A soft pink light suddenly suffused
the ship's interior, revealing fixed
ladders ascending the smooth metal
walls. There were no aliens in sight,
to Premium's diasppointment.
'May I come up and meet you, face
to face?' She called, i have no hidden
weapons, and doubtless your
detectors will already have told you
that my concealed radio is switched
off.'
i admire your honesty, Premium,
and it woud be foolish to try to
deceive us. We know more about you
than you might think. In space we
intercepted part of a film about your
father, the celebrated secret agent,
James Bond. You are like him in
many ways. Now you can climb the
ladder on yor left, to the conference
chamber—it is the third room up, the
one with the open door.'
Premium eagerly climbed the softly
shimmering ladder, he inquisitive
fingers probing every surface as she
did so. Inwardly she laughed at the
alien's simplicity, his naive
assumption about her ancestry, when
the two names, Bond and Blonde,
were only homonyms! She thought
fondly of the days gone by when the
ageing James had been one of her
earliest lovers. Poor clumsy James,
but he had never, never been her
father!
The small, curved conference
chamber was bathed in a gentle
amber light.
'Please sit down,' said the central
alien. He was flanked by four similar
figures with hexagonal metal heads
and hexagonal metal bodies. The
central alien had two arms and two
multi-jointed legs, ending in magnetic
clamps. The other aliens had two,
four or six arms, and an incredible
array of legs. Premium stared at their
lower limbs, which varied from one,
ending in the caterpillar-track
movement, to six jointed, flexed,
metal rods, like legs on a fly.
Each alien had what appeared to be
a pair of eye units in each of the six
vertical head facets, perhaps with
others she couldn't see. It seemed to
Premium that the aliens stared back
at her legs as she crossed them high
on the thich, after sliding into the soft
but transparent glossy chair, she was
quite used to being stared at, but not
by more than one pair of eyes per
head. At least the film replay hadn't
shown any tears in her best gold
tights!
'May I know your names and
mission?' she asked confidently, after
the initial mutual survey.
'We have no names, only call signs,
which I will endeavour to represent
in your language. I am Al, the first
among equals. Let me introduce A2
here, B5 there, E3 and H7. Please
note my care to speak English to you,
not American, though so many TV
programmes monitored seemed to be
a confused mixture of both.
'As to our mission, that is very
simple. We have the science and the
power to dominate the Universe, to
colonise millions of worlds, to
develop huge numbers and to acquire
infinite wealth. In the past, our
ancestors tried to do just that. But we
have learned philosophy. We
understand the utter futility of great
wealth, and the pointlessness of great
numbers, which only means more
potential rivals and competitors.
Numbers and wealth do not satisfy
our inner cravings.'
'Do you seek immortality then?'
Premium asked A l .
'We more or less have that now,
through replaceability and functional
duplication. We may look about the
same size as you, but by molecular
miniaturisation we are vastly more
complex, with plenty of room for
duplicate parts. My head, as you
would call it, has a replaceable alloy
exterior and my six brain units are in
constant communication with each
other, with my colleages and with the
spaceship's master memories and
processors. If one brain unit fails, it
is easily replaced, with the new unit
quickly acquiring knowledge and my
personality from the remaining five.
As you clearly noticed, we have many
kinds of upper and lower limb units
and can interchange or replace them
at will, depending on our immediate
task.'
'And how do you reproduce?'
probed Premium keenly.
