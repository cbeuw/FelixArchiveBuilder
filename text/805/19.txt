'By building new parts and
assembling a new individual.' said
A 2 . taking over the conversation. He
had a lighter, softer voice than A l .
'We can design and build aa
individual for a particular job. instead
of relying on the hazards or biological
chance like you primitive Earthlings.
"We do not waste energy and time on
sex and love as you obsessed people
do."
'It's not a waste of time!' Premium
protested vigorously. 'It's great fun.
And with your mechanical lives you
miss the fascination of individual
development from babyhood to youth
and maturity. You miss the superb
variety of unplanned human
personality and appearance. How can
you do without love, the centrepiece
of my existence?'
E3 answered her gently.
'We avoid its pains as well as its
pleasures. We were organic like you,
millions of years ago, but that is
fragile, unreliable and unstable—no
basis for prolonged survival. By
becoming electro-mechanical we
became masters of ourselves and of
the Universe."
Premium thought how dead they all
looked, with no breathing, no
fidgetting. no moving lips when
sound emerged from the invisible
loudspeakers. With eyes in six
directions, they did not even turn their
heads to look when another alien
spoke. Only their eye units swivelled
occasionally, and she was still a little
unnerved to have so many eyes
trained on her from different angles.
She recrossed her legs, smoothed
down her skirt, the continued her
questioning.
'You still have not told me the
purpose of your mission," she
reminded them sternly.
'I was coming to that when you
interrupted me,' said A l , moving a
little closer on his multi-jointed legs,
i n our enormously long history, we
have learned to succeed materially.
We have philosophy to give us
judgement, but philosophy is sterile:
it is analytical and destructive, rather
than constructive. Always we have
felt that something was lacking from
our existence, some higher purpose.
Or some aspect of being which cannot
be reduced to equations and sub-
molecular particles.'
i knew it!' exclaimed Premium.
'You lack a soul. That's obvious from
your attitude to love."
'Yes. We lack a soul." agreed A l ,
as his companions at last moved their
heads in agitation.
H7 spoke for the first time.
'We had great difficulty in
monitoring your broadcasts as we
came through space. Our radar
stealth-shield interferes to some
extent, but the main problem is this:
As the Earth spins on its axis, so the
TV signals beamed up your
geostationary relay satellites also
rotate in space, so we only caught a
tiny fraction of each programme. And
very few of those programmes
mentioned souls.'
'What is worse,' interrupted B5,
'your multiplicity of toungues and
dialects confused our language
decipherment computers for a long
time. Normally on a planet, a
dominant language eventually
extinguishes all others. Yet we learnt
on landing yesterday that a single TV
wavelength from London carries
programmes in English. Welsh,
French, Gujerate, Bengali and Urdu!'
A2 now continued: 'Not only was
there the intermittent signal problem
and the different languages, but you
even seem to have different religions
co-existing, with quite different views
about God and the soul. There was
one American religious broadcast
which we were able to analyse in
detail two days ago, with a fairly
simple message. It told us about .
Christ's second coming, and about the
profits. When we first monitored you
in the crowd, we hoped that your
strange white headdress indicated a
head nun, or a high priestess of
religion. We would like you to bring
each of us a soul, if you can obtain
them."
'That is our purpose,' agreed A l .
'Give us a soul, and we will leave
your planet in peace."
Using all her powers of self-
control, Premium just managed to
suppress an outburst of laughter at
being mistaken for a head nun. She
thought deeply for a while, bent over
in the glass chair, then sat up straight.
'Your stay here is causing great
worry and disruption of everyday
life," she admonished. 'The people
feel afraid in the presence of such
superior beings and such advanced
technology. At his first coming,
Christ did not seem a threat to the
humans around him. He was born of
a woman; he looked like the people
and seemed humble, sharing their
troubles. Your spaceship seems alien
and hostile.
T will make a bargain with you. I
will take me a day to accomplish what
you want, but tomorrow I will bring
you five of the best souls available.
In return, I ask that you leave as soon
as you receive them. You must also
take off without harming anything.
You must unconvert those religious
zombies, too. I should warn you that
any attempts to examine the souls I
bring could easily damage or destroy
them—just reverently put them in
your heads, unanalysed. They will not
all look alike, as they are very
individual. They will not harm or
attack you.'
A l advanced smoothly to within a
yard of Single 0-1 's chair. 'We are
not used to hearing inferior beings
telling us what we must do, but we
are desperate for souls, your terms
seem fair, and we think that you are
honest. H7 will prepare a de-
conversion tape for our recruits whom
we shall no longer need after take-off.
If we had required them for military
purposes against your armies, you
would have found them supermen and
superwomen, not zombies, once
activated by our signal.
'As for our take-off tomorrow, we
will use our anti-gravity shield, so
there will be no radiation or flame
hazard, though you should keep
everyone well clear. You should stop
the tube system below and empty the
underground car parks near here.
Does that satisfy you?'
'Almost,' Premium answered.
She stood up, put her mouth near
his head and whispered briefly.
A l drew back sharply, then
stopped. After a moment's though, he
said: 'Why not? It sounds harmless
enough. So we will see you
tomorrow, Premium, without fail.
We shall not see you again after that
as we are planning the difficult
transition to a new and better
Universe, but the souls you bring will
give us fresh confidence for such a
task. You can leave now, by the way
you came up.'
After Premium's brief visit to the
spaceship the next day, she waited
with L in the crowd to watch the
expected take-off. Knowing that the
aliens would be watching her
especially, single 0-1 waved and blew
a kiss as the tall metal cylinder began
to rise. Perhaps they might even
replay the film one day she thought.
Soon the spaceship had completely
disappeared from sight, ending its
monitoring of the crowd.
Thus on the third day of their
mission to Earth, the visitors from
space departed as promised. They
ascended into the heavens almost
noiselessly, except for a great rushing
wind.
'Mission accomplished L,' said
Premium wearily. A tear spilled down
her cheek. 'You know, I was growing
quite fond of the simple-minded
aliens."
'Don't tell me that you made love
to them just now?" her boss asked
sharply.
'No—but I did kiss them all, by
mutual agreement. The first aliens
I've ever kissed. And dear old A l
even pinched my bottom!"
'What did you take them in that
stainless steel casket, Premium? The
Prime Minister and I were furious that
you wouldn't take us into your
confidence yesterday. We have to
report immediately to the PM's Office
for debriefing. But why are you
laughing now, single 0-1?'
Premium was giggling almost too
much to answer.
i was just imagining those poor
deluded aliens solemnly sitting in
their spacecraft with their souls
stuffed into their brains! 'is so funny!'
'Kindly explain to this less
perceptive mortal just what bargain
you struck yesterday with thos all-
powerful aliens, with absolutely no
authorisation from me or the PM?'
'That's easy,' Premium replied.'
'You remember the miracle of the
leaves and fishes, and my little lecture
on homonyms? Well, I gambled on
thos much too logical aliens still not
having solved the problem of our
illogical language. I'm sure that A2
said profits, not prophets, yesterday.
They wanted souls, so I gave them
souls—or at least soles, as that is what
I actually promised.'
'Premium—you didn't—you don't
mean...'
'Yes, L. That casket I delivered
thirty minutes ago contained three of
the best flat fish and two expensive
leather stick-on soles. And they just
stuffed them into their brains as I
watched! Isn't that priceless?'
L turned even more scarlet.
'So you mean that you gambled the
entire safety oof this planet on a stupid
pun, Premium?'
'Well, it worked," said the
unrepentant secret agent, 'They
departed happily for a better
Universe, and I'm still enjoying this
one. Let's take that taxi over there to
Downing Street. If the PM's private
secretary can make one, I could do
with a stiff bloody Margaret!'
