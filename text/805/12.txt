Hairdressers given the

day a strongly worded note was found
inside the locked room.
The hairdressers first started to
operate in the Union last year when
they were asked to by last year's
President Christine Taig.
Mr Peacock told FELIX that he had
suggested an hourly rate but this was
negotiable; his main priority was to
formalise the arrangement to ensure
that students were not being charged
an excessive rate, as well as to
improve security.
One of the hairdressers told FELIX
last week that the Union had asked for
£5 per hour for rent of the room. She
said that the venture would no longer
be viable under such circumstances.
It is not known where the
hairdressers, Kate and Phil, can be
contacted.
