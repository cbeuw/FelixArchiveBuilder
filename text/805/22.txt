Poems by Arun B Samaddar
THE ETERNAL CYCLE
I walk carefully
through the leaves of autumn,
in a compassionate reverence.
Sporadic wind sheds flocks of wizen leaves,
raises them in sibilant whirls.
and splashes against me;
I listen in their husky whisper;
their pain of separation.
How many leaves dropped over the ages!
Are they all different,
or coming back again and again?
I follow the dancing cascade,
find it growing as a river,
meandering on the plane,
rushing towards the sea, and losing its self.
Vapour climbs the sky from the sea,
travels as clouds,
drops on the earth as rain,
forms glacier, and melts down again,
in the journey in the nonstop cycles.
I tremble as does a last leaf in the autumn,
at the edge of a tiny branch,
counting moments, days, or years
before I cease to live embodied.
Where do I come from, and where do I go?
Am I too in a cycle?
I can see only this life, rest in oblivion;
is this life a simple broken line,
a semi-circle, full circle,
or mere a dot on it, or?
I dip into the depth of the quantum physics;
why a particle light years away,
resonates instantly with my heart beats,
defeating the speed of light; the relativity!
Am I omnipotent?
Are you, me, it, and that, all the same?
Have I just known just enough,
yes, God may exist.
My ego pulls me back.
I rename God as the Truth, or as Quanta.
My ego reconciles, yes, I believe then.
WHEN I TRAVEL
FASTER THAN LIGHT
I wander with great wonder,
in the galaxies beyond the distant quasars,
in the mind boggling infinite,
where I hit the blind end of my imagination,
and travel down (or up, or?!) in a split second,
billions (!!) of light years, to this earth,
in the darkness of my bedroom.
I wonder on this earth; why
on the equator where
the man incepted from the ape,
millions of years ago,
thousands wither away of food,
under the same noble sky witnessing,
the elixir of the earth's resources
squeezed into bottles of champagne,
or into the mini harems in jumbo jets.
My pinching monkey pinches,
how meagre a part of these
could be enough, if deviated, to save
those pathetic, sparkling, dimming eyes?
'Bravo comrade!'?
•No, I do not sing your song.
I grapple in the missing link,
"in the history of races, the religious theories,
in our volatile sympathy, snobbish compassion,
and in our boisterous aid programmes.
Could I write poems, if I were one of them?
Please do not crown my poem as a poem.
The 'woman' is escaping from more women, and
inharmonious pleasure opens Pandora's box;
occult bastard-virus springs out,
we succumb before our helpless eyes.
Doctors of philosophy lost their spines,
and philosophy; create
catastrophic weapons and deadly drugs.
We create computers in our image;
when the Supreme Computer (some say God)
will implement in us;—the'soulful computers,
that happiness is different to pleasure,
while peace is further different?
A WINTRY MADRIGAL
When the snow falls
and embellishes the shrubs,
I like to extol the flowers of camellia,
to my heart's content.
In fact, I like almost all the flowers,
but admiringly love those
which remain tender
in the extreme climate: as dp
the snow-patched camellias
smiling in the freezing winter,
and the resplendent flowers of cactus,
blooming under the scorching sun,
on the singed rocks and shifting sand,
in dehydrating desert air.
Much after the snow fall has stopped,
in a holiday morning,
when the lives around are still asleep
under the spell of the polar wind,
and the crystalline flakes slide silently
from the tearless weeping willows,
I like to watch
at the foot prints of blackbirds
in my snow covered back yard, and
weave the cobwebs of life and time,
with my past, present, and
the imaginary future.
In the dead of a frosty night,
when all the noise has ceased,
but the incessant crickets,
I like to gaze at the full-circle rainbow
around the veiled moon
behind the transfixed cirri,
and ruminate over my tropical holidays
where in a sweaty dark night, once
your soul came out from under your fiery flesh,
and wondered with me,
at the sky studded with stars,—
'where would we be placed,
if we become stars when we die;
side by side, or far away!'
At the earth's aphelion,
in the languishing sunny day,
when the shadows tallen fast,
the pale rays leap to the tree tops
no sooner than the day has begun,
I need to bury my face in your lap.
Please, hold me tight,
guard my eyes from that fathomless blue
beyond the dispersed nimbus
above the tireless wings
of the thirsty skylark,
the incarnadined horizon, and
the swinging pendulums
on the leafless plane trees.
They will drive me mad, my dear!
Please, press my head
in the warmth of your pulsating bosom,
under your inebriating, yet reassuring eyes,
and let me slumber,
recluse in your affection,
in the tranquility of your love, perhaps,
after I have planted an entozoon in your wcmb,
in the extreme desire to imitate God.
