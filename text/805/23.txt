DREAMING
I woke up in the night with
A smile from the dream
Burning sweet in my mind for
A few precious moments.
I stirred, but my searching
Hand touched empty space
And cold silence closed in
When I called.
Where has the dream gone?
Why must I wake
To remember the void
Where bright passion once was?
Now I pay for those
Seconds of trust when I left
Peace of mind in the hands
Of another. 'Betrayal!'
The quick, hurt heart cries;
But the voice in my head
Whispers hauntingly clearâ€”
What more could I ask than
The spell of illusion,
So brief but so dear,
That said even for me
There was love.
