A
PERPLEXING
DREAM
It was morning. The sun was shining
through chinks in the drawn curtains,
bright beams of sunlight were landing
on my bedcloathes. I lay in bed lazily,
half asleep and half awake.
Then I heard someone at the front
door. Bobby answered it. I could hear
talking: then footsteps, two pairs,
mounting the stairs up to my attic
room.
There was a knock, and my door
swung open.
'Here is somebody who has come
to see you' said Bobby and he
withdrew.
At the door was a young boy of
about four years old. I made no
attempt to rise from my bed because
the child was happy to jump on it
immediately he saw me.
Needless to say I was very charmed
by this ingenious young visitor. He
seemed absolutely content to play
about on the bed for a while; between
the sun beams and the shining sheets.
I'm always good with children. They
like meâ€”and I like them very much
too. I don't know why it is but I've
noticed how a young child will almost
immediately start treating me like an
older brother.
This was certainly a nice way of
starting the morning. Now the child
was at the end of the bed next to my
legs. We looked in a friendly manner
towards each other.
'So who are you?' I asked.
'I'm playing the part of Jane Eyre,'
he said, obviously a little embarrassed
at having a girl's part, even if it was
the title role, for his cheeks shone
brightly and he began to go shy.
'Oh yes,' I said, then encouragingly
added 'It's very good to have such an
important role. It means everybody
looks upon you highly, and values
your contribution.'
The child hugged my knee in a
childish gesture of gratitude for my
reassurances; and I said again how
good was his part. Whilst saying so
I thought how nice it would be to
watch this angel of a boy in the play
when it was performed.
I slid round on the bed and upset
the child playfully from my knee.
'So why have you come to tell me
all this,' I asked with a smile.
'Because you're playing the other
lead role' he replied, crawling
towards me and being careful not to
slip off my bed.
'What? I'm playing the other lead
role?' I exclaimed in surprise. 'But
how coult that be?'
'Because you are the one who has
written a play,' he replied.
'Yes, but you see I haven't written
a play,' I began. 'Well not a proper
play anyway...just a small thing, a
long time ago...you can't mean that
can you?' I was genuinely surprised.
'So who says that I have written a
play,' I finally asked.
'Everyone,' said the child,
withdrawing a little. 'Everyone says
so.'
The child could see that I didn't
understand it.
'Everyone says it is you who has
written a play,' he repeated, this time
pleading for me to understand, and
looking as if he might become upset
at any moment if I didn't.
'Oh well...that's odd,' I said at
length. I leant back on my pillow, I
really couldn't understand a thing.
The child started crawling about
again, like a little beetle: Up and
down the folds of the white sheet, his
small legs sometimes being caught in
the rays of the morning sun; and it
was nice enough for me to lie back
and watch him. Presently I was falling
back to sleep...but I jumped up with
a start when I realised he was crushed
underneath a rind of honey. I could
just see his legs wriggling weakly. I
freed him from the wax. At first he
lay on his back and didn't move.
There was gooey honey caught
between the segments of his body.
Then he began to wriggle again and
gain strength.
'I'm sorry' I said, as if it was my
fault, forgetting that it wasn't I who
had crushed him underneath the
honey rind.
'Are you alright?',
'Yes' he said shortly.
I said nothing more, then it
suddenly occurred to me that I knew
nothing about beetles.
'Good Lord,' I said to myself 'Here
I am with a beetle and I don't know
how to look after one or anything. I
don't know how heavy that rind of
honey seemed to the poor fellow. I
don't know how long he'll live, or
what he eats...
Dear, dear me...I don't know a
thing.'
I resolved to exercise great care and
to be on the alert for all sorts of
unexpected incidents. Then I leant
forward on all fours in my pyjamas
to have a closer look at him. When
my nose was almost touching I began
to hear something. It was very
surprising. From inside him was
coming the broadcasting of one of
those taxi-cab operators. I could hear
lots of crackling and interference, and
a voice giving instructions for a cab
to go to Hope Street.
'A radio,' I said aloud and got to
my feet and drew the curtains.
It was a nice looking day. I started
to dress. Then I remembered the
radio.
I went over and picked it up: I tried
to get it to make some sound again.
There were holes, with matches
poking out. I tried twisting the
matches, or pressing their heads. I
couldn't get a sound. Then I idly
realised it was just an empty
matchbox I was holding, so I cast it
aside...and I don't remember
anything else.. .and I suppose that was
the end of the dream.
