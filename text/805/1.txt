Catering Assistant quits
IC Union Catering Assistant Mark Anderson resigned from his post
on Tuesday, following the dismissal of Catering Manager Norman
Jardine last week. Mr Anderson had been reinstated on 25th May when
the investigation into alleged Snack Bar mismanagement had been
concluded.

FELIX in defamation threat
The FELIX Editor, Judith Hackney,
has received a letter from the
solicitors of one of the people
mentioned in last week's Blackmail
column. The letter stated that the
person felt that the identity of 'Mr
Filofax' was 'patently obvious' to
readers of the column, as 'he is the
only College notable who both carries
a filofax and has a girl-friend with the
name as the same as that published.'
The letter asked for an 'unqualified
retraction and apology' in this week's
issue of FELIX. Otherwise, it
warned, a Writ for Defamation would
be issued against the magazine and the
author of the column.
Mr Anderson's resignation follows
weeks of speculation over his future
within the Union's trading outlets. He
had been offered an open-ended
contract by IC Union at the beginning
of last week when he was cleared of
allegations of 'gross
mismanagement'.
The new Union Manager David
Peacock commented that he was sad
that Mr Anderson had resigned. He
said that he felt that the strain had hit
Mark harder as he was relatively
young and that it would have made
it difficult for anybody to continue in
that situation.
'Mark hasn't left us in the lurch-
he was perfectly entitled to leave. We
can't whinge', Mr Peacock added.
Mr Anderson told FELIX yesterday
that he had always enjoyed working
in the Snack Bar but said: T feel it
would be inappropriate for me to
continue to be employed by people
who have demonstrated their mistrust
in my integrity.'
He remarked that he was sad to
have to resign, and also that some
people 'think themselvesfitto judge
him (Mr Jardine) with regard to
matters of which they are completely
ignorant.'
Mr Anderson described his
resignation as an indication of where
his loyalties lie.
Mr Peacock told FELIX that a
major refurbishment operation of the
Union Snack Bar will be carried out
over the Summer, ready for its re-
opening at the beginning of next term.
The Union President Sydney
Harbour-Bridge (name changed in aid
of Comic Relief) will be issuing a
statement about the Snack Bar
sometime this week. We hope to
publish it in full in next week's issue
of FELIX.
