Hello again! I’m afraid this week
I wish to register a complaint. It’s
incredible how few of Imperial’s
10,000 students seem able to solve
the Felix crossword. A basic prin-
ciple of charity suggests that there
must be more successful solvers
out there – more than three, that is
– so if you’re a member of this silent
brotherhood, please do send in your
solutions.
Right, now I’ve got that off my
chest, a few words about this week’s
puzzle. It’s not thematic, though
some of the entries are related. 22
across is rare, but easily verifiable
online; in any case, I always try to
give obscure answers easy clues.
Good luck! Snufkin

Royal School of Mines
President
Oxford v Cambridge, Yale v
Harvard, Imperial v Medics,
Celtic v Rangers, Liverpool v
Everton... so you think you’ve
seen rivalry? Not until you’ve
seen this, a rivalry that both
divides and unites people
from the grass it’s played on
right up to some of the top
boardrooms in the world.
The Bottle Match, a rugby
match played between the
Royal School of Mines (RSM)
and the Camborne School
of Mines is one of the fierc-
est and oldest fixtures in the
country, if not the world.
The 2004-5 season marks
the 103rd year of this event,
with the first match occurring
in 1902, which is thought to
have resulted in an honour-
able draw. More games were
played between 1902 and 1920,
though records are not clear
about the results. Except
for the war years, however,
a match between Camborne
and the RSM has been played
every year since 1921 (during
the war, RSM students were
evacuated to Camborne and
played for them!)
The fixture acquired its
name in 1946 when some
RSM students liberated a
two foot high tin bottle off a
Bass-Charrington beer lorry.
It has been used as a run-
ning trophy ever since. The
first ‘Bottle Match’, in 1946,
was won by Camborne by 11
points to 3, however the RSM
won it back the following year.
In 1947, ‘the Bottle’ was deco-
rated with the crests of both
colleges.
The Bottle Match is the
high point of both Camborne’s
and the RSM’s year. Played
alternatively in Cornwall and
London, the matches are sup-
ported by vast and dedicated
crowds of current students
and alumni. From those who
can’t be there, messages of
good luck come in to the play-
ers in the week preceeding
the match, by letter, fax and,
in this modern age, text and
email, from places as far away
as Canada, Australia and
South Africa! Though both
colleges have undergone tur-
moil recently with the chang-
es to the faculty structure
at Imperial and the move-
ment of Camborne School of
Mines to Falmouth, one thing
remains: the spirit of these
two unique institutions, rep-
resented at this most special
of occasions.
Since the 1950s, players on
the winning side have been
presented with personal tank-
ards from the South African
based company Union
Corporation/Gencor. This
tradition continues, with the
tankards provided by Michael
West and the Mining Journal.
Such presentations provide
a lifetime remainder of win-
ning the bottle and are much
appreciated by the players.
The Bottle Match is now a
positive festival of sport as,
over the last century, football
and hockey have being added
to the weekend’s fixtures.
Most recently, squash has
also been added on the Friday
night. Apparently, the first
squash match occured when
a couple of players made the
mistake of turning up to the
bar one night with squash
rackets – and so a tradition
was born. In the near future
we hope to add golf and a boat
race (though only across the
Serpentine!)
A recent results roundup
shows that RSM rugby are
on an eight Bottle Match
unbeaten run. This year, cap-
tain Eddy Poulding hopes to
lead his legends-in-the-mak-
ing into history. The football
team drew last year five all,
to retain their cup as current
holders, after being a hango-
ver-induced five-one down at
half-time.
Both the ladies’ and men’s
hockey teams lost last year,
though they’ve been training
hard recently (in what seem
like Arctic not West London
conditions) and hope to set
therecordstraight.Camborne
won last year’s squash tour-
nament, though only because
one of our players had a bro-
ken arm and our female play-
er got a lot of abuse!
For those interested in sport
and tradition and who are up
for an old-style fierce varsity
game, the Bottle Match is for
you! The games take place
this Saturday and tickets
are on sale now in the RSM
office (mainly at lunchtimes).
Contact our Sports Officer,
tobias.dalton@ic.ac.uk, for
more details.
