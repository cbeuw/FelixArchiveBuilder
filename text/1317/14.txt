ALBUM REVIEWS
Traditionally,atthebeginningofeach
year, the music press go crazy over
who will be the ‘next big thing’. Last
year all the trendy magazines proph-
esised the rise of Franz Ferdinand,
who have now gone on to take the
world by storm. But their predic-
tions don’t always come true – how
big are Black Rebel Motorcycle Club
in comparison, for instance?
So far, we’ve had two main bands
competing for the most hype gener-
ated this year. There’s the genuinely
thrilling Bloc Party with their first
release Silent Alarm, and now we
have the Kaiser Chiefs with their
debut, Employment. Success is
almost guaranteed for the Leeds
four-piece, having already been
given the NME seal of approval in
the form of the ‘Radar Award’ at last
week’s ceremony. But do they live up
to their hype?
It all starts off reasonably well, with
Everyday I Love You Less And Less,
a cheeky opener with its fuzzed-up
keyboards and ska rhythms, and its
talk of dumping someone whilst pro-
claiming “And my parents love me /
And my girlfriend loves me”, leading
you to wonder how many girls he’s
got hidden away. A slew of decent
tracks follow on from this; there’s
the explosive I Predict A Riot, which
despite previous reviews in this
paper (see Felix 1301) is a great
song mapping out urban decay, and
the recent release Oh My God with
its trippy verses building up into a
crashing chorus.
A few tracks in, though, you’ll get a
nagging feeling that you’ve heard it
all before. It’s not surprising, since in
general Employment plays as if the
Chiefs have been grave robbing the
Britpop tomb rather then producing
an original work. The influences are
easy to spot: the aforementioned Oh
My God could have easily come from
a Beta Band album, Time Honoured
Tradition has Merseyside influenc-
es (Zutons, anyone?) and there’s a
general throwback to any number of
jumpy mid-nineties bands.
Pillaging the past never harmed a
band’s career though – just ask any
of the myriad of rock bands around
today. You Can Have It All – one of
the standout tracks – is a beautiful
piece of sixties-era pop in the vein
of The Kinks and The Moody Blues,
and Saturday Night (which features
ex-Blur guitarist Graham Coxon on
the motorbike, trivia fans) is a joyful
homage to Supergrass, with driving
guitar lines and background ‘oohs’
intact.
So are the Kaiser Chiefs worthy of
the hype they’ve received? Well…...
es. No. Sort of. There’s enough proof
here that the Kaisers know how
to put together a catchy album,
with appealing hooks and flowing
wordplay intact. But the fact that
they wear their influences heavily
on their sleeve stops this collection
from becoming as memorable as it
could have.
The Kaiser Chiefs need to create
their own unique niche before they
can start taking over the world.

Album covers tend to be a bit of a
giveaway: anything abstract general-
ly means some weird or exciting new
music; run of the mill artist pictures
are intrinsic to follow ups of previ-
ous successes; whilst stark images
and colours usually adorn dance
acts’ LPs. So what does the smould-
ing grin of Portobella’s half Italian
front women, Luciana Caporaso,
brandishing a broken microphone
suggest? Jumping to conclusions, I
expected some spoilt brat, wannabe
lesbian making trashy, thrash metal
with howling banshee vocals. How
wrong could I be.
Viva La Difference! is the badly
titled to-be-released album from
Portobella, a variation on the name
of one of the most famous markets
in London. As one of the three bands
who were documented for MTV’s
Break Point, they are looking for
a base from which to launch their
album.
Their second single, the album’s
title track, was only released this
month, apparently delayed due
to huge club success, and follows
Covered In Punk, Portobella’s first
single, which came out in summer
2004. The song is a joyful mix of
bubblegum vocals and naff guitars
to Filthy/Gorgeous-style bass. Best
described as a pop cross between
Guano Apes and Peaches, Portobella
serves up synthetic backing to
dreamy vocals and raucous rants.
Spend The Night floats on synth-
strings with dubious echoes of a
drum pad every ten seconds, show-
ing a softer side to the group, com-
pared to the ‘in your face’ approach
of most of the album. The lyrics
aren’t really supposed to mean any-
thing (being aimed at clubbing) and
are vaguely based on the title of
each track – they are just another
component in the mix.
Almost a viable Eurovision entrant,
the sound of Portobella walks the fine
line between acceptable and cheesy
europop, and could be considered as
London’s take on the Scissor Sisters,
although not a touch on the camp
gods of pop. Meet Me At The Y Bar
is one of the highlights of the record:
supported by thick background
fuzz, Caporaso sings loveable punky
vocals carrying a pop chart melody
not seen since circa 1995.
Viva La Difference! appeals to
your childish side. Pop-princess
track titles such as Freakin’ In
Stereo and Spellbound reflect the
weak songwriting and limited tal-
ents of the band, but there’s a little
something that manages to capture
your imagination. Like the rubbish
bands from your childhood that you
still love although you know they are
undeniably pants, Portobella have a
time and a place to be played, and as
such fit the bill perfectly.
If you are looking for a blast of
cheesy-electro-rock-pop to do the
astro to in your room when no-one
is looking, Portobella are the answer,
although they won’t keep you up all
night.

It seems like the end of an era.
Every week, a rock or rhythm and
blues legend dies aged 60.
Most recently, Doobie Brothers
drummer Kieth Knusden and cou-
ple of weeks ago, Jim Capaldi. One
of the most innovative drummers
of his time, Capaldi played with
Traffic. Their album, John Barley
Corn Must Die, was the first I ever
fell in love with, instantly relating to
the jazz, blues and folk-influenced
songwriting. Somewhere between
then and now I discovered Hissing
Of Summer Lawns by Joni Mitchell.
Although it was the only album of
hers I have ever got on with (the
eighties had a bad affect on her
music), she found a niche and devel-
oped an original and easy-going jazz-
ish sound.
Listening to Monade’s new album,
A Few Steps More, I was instantly
reminded of Mitchell. The pseu-
do-jazz backing almost verges on
lounge but is saved from toppling
over the edge by a twist of French
lyrics and ambient links. The album
comes across as sleep music, lull-
ing you into a false sense of comfort
wherever you are but by the end is
as boring as a party political broad-
cast.
Perhaps trying to expand on their
fan base, the track listings not only
include English and French titles,
but also Spanish and German; the
point of this isn’t clear since all the
singing is blatantly French. Like
Rammstein, the foreign language
vocals put the album in a different
light, which would probably be its
saving grace, if lead singer Laetitia
Sadler could muster up any vocal
variation. It’s a far cry from her
Stereolab experience.
The music is nothing inspiring.
The organ-style Moog can be heard
on many tracks with jazzy drumming
breaks for inane keyboard solos. The
diversity between songs is about two
beats per minute, other than that
it all merges to form a mass of
grey. Only one track past the upbeat
opener of Wash And Dance has any
continuity and finesse (Sensible Et
Extensible), which is a pity since the
album started with promise.
I really can’t get excited by this
album, neither can I bring myself
to dislike it. Being the middle-of-
the-road LP it is, A Few Steps More
will fade into obscurity, being played
at middle-class dinner parties up
and down the country. Maybe they
haven’t heard of Joni Mitchell but
now you have, you don’t need to
listen to this poor adventure of the
same vein.

Some such jazz (and indie)
Scene favourites the Kaiser Chiefs finally bring out their debut album, Monade’s
pseudo-jazz stylings fail to impress, and Portobella don’t cover us in punk
