Shall We Dance was originally a
Japanese film that won a huge audi-
ence, both in Japan and the western
world.
There are three things I utterly
despise when it comes to movies.
Number one: Hollywood remakes of
small low-key productions that ruin
the warmth and small scale of the
original film. Number two: romantic
comedies. Number three: Jennifer
Lopez. Therefore it was with an
understandable sense of trepidation
that I entered the cinema to watch
a Hollywood rehash of a romantic
comedy with Jennifer Lopez.
The actual plot is surprisingly like-
ableandmyoriginalsenseofimpend-
ing doom vanished quite quickly.
Although predictable and clichéd at
many, many points throughout the
film, you find yourself actually enjoy-
ing it. The movie starts off with an
introduction to the very creatively
named John Clark (Gere), an over-
worked businessman commuting to
and from his office every day. He
arrives home every evening to his
graceful wife (Sarandon) and his two
children and his dog but you get the
impression that everything in his life
is pretty boring and predictable.
At the time of his latest birthday,
Clark is hit with a quiet midlife cri-
sis that all men with a wife, 2.5 kids
and a dog undergo, and he real-
ises something is missing in his life
(obviously tango lessons).
Blankly staring outside the win-
dow of his train whilst commuting
home one day, Clark sees a beautiful
young woman (er... Lopez) staring
out of one of the windows above a
sign for a dance academy. Intrigued
by her solitude, the tortured look in
her eyes and obviously her figure,
Clark madly stumbles off the train
and enrols in the dance academy to
get closer to her.
Clark’s plan backfires – he is
instead taught ballroom dancing by
Miss Mitzy (Anita Gillette) whilst
Lopez, who is later known to be
a dancer named Paulina, remains
aloof and cold – in her own words:
“I prefer not to socialise with stu-
dents.”
Funnily enough, Clark turns out
to have a hidden talent for danc-
ing. What an amazing coincidence.
Also very unpredictably so, his wife
gets suspicious of her husband’s
absences from the house and sus-
pects that her husband is having an
affair. Clichéd? No, not at all.
The performances by the cast are
strong – Gere fits in quite nicely as
the middle-aged man with every-
thing but that crucial something,
and Sarandon’s portrayal of the
unsaid but still strong love that
exists between a middle-aged mar-
ried couple is exquisite. In fact, the
entire cast perform consistently well
and deliver strong performances,
really bringing their characters to
life.
The entire cast, that is, apart from
Jennifer Lopez. It appears that in
her attempt to fit into her charac-
ter’s role as aloof and detached,
she has taken it a little too far and
appears wooden and impassive –
indeed, you would be forgiven for
mistaking her in some scenes for
her wax reproduction in Madame
Tussauds. One commendable point
that cannot go overlooked, however,
is that her dance scenes with Gere
were completely flawless. The lady
can move – I’ll give you that – and
so can Gere!
Overall, this is not a bad movie to
watch if you don’t want to involve
the use of a single brain cell. It
is mind-numbingly predictable
and clichéd every step of the way,
and some scenes are slow-moving.
However, the characters are defi-
nitely novel and engaging, and I am
sure Jennifer Lopez’s inclusion in
the film will certainly have a part to
play in the film’s grossing at the box
offices. Marya Ziauddin
In step with most chick flicks
Like the tango, Shall We Dance is absolutely routine

Hide and seek
Released: 25 February
Hide And Seek revolves around a
widower (Robert DeNiro) and his
daughter (Dakota Fanning). They
move states and Emily (Fanning)
soon creates an imaginary friend
named Charlie.
Imaginary friends can sometimes
seem so real... For Emily, her games
with her imaginary friend have
become anything but simple and
innocent. Instead, she finds herself
in the middle of a series of increas-
ingly nightmarish acts that even
her father David (Robert De Niro)
cannot stop. Who – or what – is
Charlie?
After a highly anticipated wait,
Hide And Seek arrives on British
screens this week. So why is it so
highly anticipated? You only have to
look at our American counterparts
to discover why.
In the opening weekend, Hide And
Seek toppled Meet The Fockers from
the top of the US box office chart,
raking in $22miilion. Highly impres-
sive considering that it’s a horror
movie with a limited audience – not
only due to appeal, but also rating
restrictions.
I would reveal to you the mystery
behind Emily’s sinister unnatural
hobby if I knew... but the guys at
20th Century Fox would turn me
into mush.
Besides, I don’t know anyway. Not
least because of the fact that Fox
have employed extreme measures
to conceal the twist ending. Fox have
gone to unprecendented lengths to
protect the top-secret twist, ship-
ping a film to US cinemas without
the final reel for the first time in
the studio’s history, accompanied
by some very angry looking butch
men.
Therein lies the movie’s main sell-
ing point, which been the main drv-
ing force in admission in the opening
weekend. ‘Be the first to discover
the twist’ and ‘find out before some-
body else does’. Alan Ng
