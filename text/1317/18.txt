We first join Dan Foreman (Dennis
Quaid) as the Head of Marketing
at Sports America. He has dedi-
cated 21 years of his life to the
magazine and has managed to gain
quite a good reputation in marketing
through building relationships with
his clients.
Unbeknown to Dan, Sports
America has been taken over by
corporate giant globe.com and,
despite his years of experience, he
will soon be demoted to Assistant
Head. Further adding insult to inju-
ry, his replacement, Carter Doryea
(Topher Grace), has no experience
in marketing and is only half Dan’s
age. Doryea is a business school
prodigy, and he changes the depart-
ment of marketing by introducing
corporate synergy to boost ad sales
in Sports America.
This is an unfortunate moment
for Dan to be demoted because his
wife (Marg Helgenberger) is expect-
ing another baby, and his daughter,
Alex (Scarlett Johansson) has trans-
ferred to a more expensive college,
New York University. Therefore,
despite the embarrassment and the
fact that he disapproves of Doryea’s
methods, Dan has to stay in his job
and become Doryea’s ‘wingman’.
Things aren’t exactly a bed of
roses for Doryea either. He is an
eager achiever who thinks that his
life will all be sorted out the minute
he achieves his promotion.
However,disasterstrikes.Doryea’s
wife of seven months leaves him,
and he soon realises that, in his
eagerness to achieve, he is left with
no friends. He tries to make friends
in the company, but it’s difficult due
to corporate cutbacks. He manages
to build quite an odd relationship
with Dan, despite Dan’s opposition.
He gets to know the Foreman family,
and meets Dan’s tomboyish daugh-
ter Alex.
There is an instant attraction
between Alex and Doryea. Since
Alex has just transferred to NYU,
they manage to keep the relation-
ship a secret from Dan. However, at
Dan’s birthday party, the cat is let
out of the bag.
In Good Company is actually
based on a phenomenon happen-
ing in our world today – corpo-
rate takeovers, cutbacks and the
old being replaced with the new.
Nevertheless, the movie manages
to avoid becoming a documentary
condemning corporate takeover, by
allowing the viewers to look through
the lenses of Dan and Doryea.
Through Dan’s perspective,
we manage to observe the nega-
tive effects of corporate takeovers.
However, the movie focuses on
Dan’s family troubles, which make
him seem more realistic to the view-
ers. The movie also makes fun of
Doryea’s awkwardness and vul-
nerability, to make the character
more endearing to the audience.
Therefore, the plot becomes more
unpredictable as the audience is not
led to favour either Dan or Doryea.
The introduction of Alex and
Doryea’s relationship is another
brilliant mind-twister in the plot. A
considerable amount of the movie
is dedicated to showing how their
relationship develops. It helps
the audience view Doryea as the
lonely, needy, confused young man
that he really is. Their relationship
also adds a softer, feminine appeal
to the movie which helps it relate
to both female and male audiences
despite the story focusing on the
two men.
The casting for this movie is bril-
liant. Dennis Quaid slips into his role
as the fatherly businessman as if the
part was written for him. Topher
Grace plays the fresh-faced eager
achiever to perfection. However,
the movie doesn’t manage to bring
out the acting talents of Scarlett
Johansson.
Overall, In Good Company is a
surprisingly good movie. Surprising
because it has a down-to-earth
theme which manages to shine
despite the high-flying conspiracy
theories we have grown used to.
It has a strong and unpredictable
storyline, and is definitely a movie to
keep you ‘in good company’.

Men and their balls...
Ever get the feeling you’re being played?
I’m sure we’ve all had that feel-
ing. The feeling of pure contentment
when we observe something that
goes to plan. Every little detail fits
nicely into place. Two such examples
of what I’m describing are Ocean’s
Eleven and Catch Me if You Can.
Watching these films and seeing
these con men cheating people out
of their money is very satisfying to
watch. Why is this so, if it is obvious-
ly wrong? I believe it’s because they
look so smooth when they’re ripping
people off. No panicking, no sweat,
they’re just cool at what they do and
you can’t help but admire them and
want them to get away with it.
Criminal is the latest film released
into the con man genre and takes a
slightly different approach. Richard
Gaddis (John C Reilly) takes the
role of the professional con man. He
knows the tricks of the trade and
is looking for a new partner in the
business. Luckily he finds just the
right man in the form of a desper-
ate Mexican named Rodrigo (Diego
Luna). Richard manages to rescue
Rodrigo from a failed attempt to rip
off a casino waitress and takes him
under his wing.
Desperately needing money to
pay off his father’s gambling debt,
Rodrigo decides to stick around to
learn a few things and profit from
Richard’s experience. It eventually
becomes clear that Rodrigo has a
gift that Richard doesn’t have, price-
less in the con man world. He looks
like a nice guy. They both find that in
order to make the big bucks they’ll
have to rely on one another.
However, when the chance to
make it big comes along by selling
a fake of the most valuable piece
of antique currency in America
to wealthy media tycoon William
Hannigan (Peter Mullan), Richard
and Rodrigo need to play their cards
right every step of the way. They
agree to split the three quarters
of a million between them, but can
Rodrigo really trust a professional
con man?
Criminal lacks the big names that
can be found in the Ocean’s Eleven,
but to be honest I think this isn’t
really a big name movie. Reilly does
a good job as the con man and Luna
carries the part of the inexperienced
sidekick very well. I found the dis-
trusting relationship between these
two rather amusing to watch and
adding a little something extra that
other films of this sort possess.
The plot is strong (although basic)
all the way through, and is easy to
follow so you won’t have to struggle
to keep up with what’s going on.
This might not be everyone’s cup of
tea, but I’d had a long day.
Another aspect of the film which
I enjoyed was that it showed how
things don’t ever go exactly as
planned, since along the way to mak-
ing their sale to Hannigan, Richard
and Rodrigo find in order to succeed
they need the help of more and more
individuals who catch on to their
dirty scam and who each want a
share of the money.
Frankly I can’t say there was
anything I hated about the film. It
wasn’t amazing and will never be
an epic but honestly, there are far
worse ways to spend an hour and a
half at the cinema.
