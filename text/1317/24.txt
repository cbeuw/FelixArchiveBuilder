Imperial Men’s 3rd 5
Imperial Medicals
Men’s 3rd 10
after extra time
By Pete Brown and
David Muthuveloe
Following their humiliating
27–0 defeat at Teddington
a fortnight previously,
Imperial’s Third XV hosted
the Medicals Third XV again,
this time as part of the
expanded Varsity day. This
game would prove to be a
much closer affair.
After a delayed kick-off
caused by an administrative
blunder, the match started
slowly with some unexpected
Imperial pressure. It soon
became clear that the game
was going to be played at
ground level with both teams
turning down the opportu-
nity to convert penalties into
points.
The Medicals defended
well, led by Wino putting in
some thundering tackles in
the pack, and soon had the
chance to take the offensive
with some strong running in
the centre. Unfortunately it
soon became clear that the
Medicals would not be able
to play their natural rucking
game, as the Imperial pack
used their weight and sup-
port in defence to turn pos-
session over on numerous
occasions, resulting in the
medics squandering some
strong scoring opportunities.
As half time approached,
the Medicals’ injuries started
to take their toll. The Imperial
pack exploited holes in the
tired defence and ran in a
well worked try which gave
them a deserved lead going
into the break.
Five-nil down at half-time
the medics were forced to
make a number of key
changes to replace the battle-
scarred players. Tactics were
also changed, to spin the ball
wider and make use of the
swift wingers.
The ball was kicked off into
the midfield, where it stayed
for half an hour with lim-
ited opportunities from both
sides to break the stalemate.
The pack excelled at the set-
pieces though and Craig and
Gary worked hard in the sec-
ond row to help win some
great line-out ball and control
the scrums.
As the final ten minutes
approached, both teams were
showing signs of fatigue and
the medics took the opportu-
nity to make some more sub-
stitutions and bring on fresh
legs. This resulted in some
strong pressure, set up by
James at scrum half, who took
the initiative to command the
midfield. Following a number
of phases drawing more and
more of the Imperial back-
line into the pack, the ball
was popped blind to Jig who
made a strong, elusive run
over the line to celebrate his
first game back after a year
and a half with the equalis-
ing try. An anteriorly dislo-
cated shoulder (the other one
this time, though) and a sub-
luxed AC joint were an added
bonus!
The conversion was missed
and the scores were tied at
five each at full time.
The captains decided on a
nail-biting extra time period
of ten minutes each way.
The first half was dominated
by medic possession but a
combination of exhaustion,
fumbled balls and last ditch
Imperial defence meant the
ever-growing crowd were in
for a finale similar in stature
to the closing stages of the
World Cup final!
The second half of extra
time continued in a similar
fashion to the first, and the
Medicals sensed that vic-
tory was there for the tak-
ing. The game was wrapped
up as Harry (a late substitu-
tion), now limping on a re-
fractured fibula, fed Ash at
electric pace who shunned
the three-man overlap to skin
his opposite man and score
under the posts off a 15 metre
run. Piers’ fluffed drop goal
effort was rendered redun-
dant by the blow of the final
whistle within a minute of the
restart.
Imperial gave it their all to
the last, but at the end of the
day the resilient, well-drilled
monster that is the Medicals
Third XV deserved their vic-
tory.

The third annual Imperial
Varsity day took place last
Wednesday, 16 February.
As most people will know,
this year’s format was
extended to include three
hockey matches, two foot-
ball matches and four rugby
matches.
Despite sub-zero wind chill
at the Harlington sports
ground, hundreds of students
ventured out to support their
teams. The afternoon pro-
vided some excellent compet-
itive sport of a high standard.
All the scores are below, and
reports appear on the next
few pages.
Trophies were presented by
Nick Gore (Sport and Leisure
Sports Development Officer
and main event organiser),
Max Marsden (ICSM Sports
Officer) and Morten Olesen
(ACC Vice Chairman) and
then, following a swift pint,
the cavalcade made its way
to Richmond for the big first
team rugby game.
The JPR Williams Cup,
the main event of the day,
attracted over 1000 students,
staff members and guests.
The atmosphere was electric
as the two teams fought out
a highly competitive match
(see back page).
Presentations were made
by Professor Rees Rawlings
and JPR Williams himself,
who awarded Jon Underwood
with the Man of the Match
award. Medicals captain
Peter Russell was delighted
to receive the winners’ tro-
phy.
The afternoon and evening
were interrupted a couple of
times by some unfortunate
incidents between Imperial
and Medical supporters.
Clearly fuelled by the intense
atmosphere of the day as
well as generous alcohol con-
sumption, they were unable
to disturb the overall run-
ning of the day and pretty
much every other supporter
enjoyedafantastictime.Many
enjoyed the rest of their night
at the after-party at Imperial
College Union, although
some medical students opted
to go to the Reynolds Bar at
Charing Cross.
Many thanks to all those
involved, who helped make
this event a great success.
We all believe that this
can continue to grow as a
sporting spectacle in future
years, as well as improv-
ing the sometimes scrappy
relations between Imperial
students and the Imperial
Medicals.
We look forward to see-
ing all of you next year at
Harlington, Richmond and
at the Reynolds Bar for the
after-party.
Varsity expansion a great success
Imperial Medicals apply pressure close to the Imperial College try line on their way to a narrow victory
