Hey there Hoff fans! The guys at Coffee Break had a little election to
find themselves a mascot, and I won! Awesome! You get to see

Dear David
Not many points available that
week, the Hoff doesn’t just hand
them out willy-nilly you know.
Almost everyone who entered got
full marks, except for the Araldite
Sniffers, who didn’t give us any
explanations. The Hoff is a harsh
mistress indeed...
Embarrassing brother
Prince William writing about his
ginger-pubed sibling, and his bad
habits (drinking, Nazism, being
ginger, etc)
Drugs are bad, mmmkay?
Kate Moss moaning that nobody
approves of her relationship with
junkie ex-Libertines frontman
Pete Doherty. I wonder why?
I’ve been a naughty boy
Michael Jackson, who’s very wor-
ried about his upcoming court
case. The less said about that, the
better.
Eight Things We Hate About You

A favourite pastime of Imperial people seems to be moaning about how shit the College is, while
simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about it. We’re proud to continue that tradition at Coffee Break.
There are eight moans here, and eight pictures too. You get a point for matching which picture goes to
which desciption, and two for telling us who it is we’re moaning about
A. They spend their Wednesday
afternoons chasing round/egg
shaped balls around, then go to
the union to get pissed (in shirts
and ties, the knobs) and sing about
their sexual prowess. But they’re at
Imperial, they don’t have any!

B. You have to feel sorry for these
guys (and it’s mostly guys). They
spend rougly 90% of their waking
day stuck in front of monitors typing
stuff that nobody understands or
cares about. It’s pointless, just like
their future careers.
C. Far too many of them are more
intrested in furthering their own
career rather than doing the job
they have now better. It’d be nice
to see just one who can form a sen-
tence that makes sense to a normal
person.
D. Apparently Imperial is a ‘world-
class institution’. But it’s being let
down by this lot who frankly, have it
way too easy. They spend half their
course on holiday, picking up peb-
bles, making sandcastles and drink-
ing sangria.
E. There aren’t many of these at
Imperial, so it’s a little unfair to pick
on them, even if they deserve it. If
you do certain courses it’s probably
possible to go days without seeing
one. Well, an attractive one at least.
It’s enought to make you like UCL.
F. There are far too many of these at
IC. Far, far too many. They’re every-
where, like rats with acne. It’s this
which gives Imperial its geeky repu-
tation. Can we not have a limit or
something on how many we have?
Please?
G. Ever had friends from another
uni come and visit? When they see
this place, the look on their face is
usually priceless. It’s an embarras-
ment. We deserve so much better!
Of all the things people moan about,
this is pretty much number one.
H. They hate the rest of us, and we
hate them. Why are they here? They
resent being part of the College, and
we’re sick of them. Can’t they just
join Royal Holloway or something?
We don’t care if they’re ‘better peo-
ple’ or not.

where you go
Capricorn
Nice going dickhead, how’d you manage
