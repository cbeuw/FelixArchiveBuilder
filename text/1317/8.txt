So, apparently there’s some sort of
friction between Imperial College
School of Medicine and Imperial
College. Why is it that both sides
seem to think the other side are
complete losers? But most impor-
tantly, who’s to blame?
Both sides have reasonable argu-
ments. Well, they would be reason-
able if they were true. The medic
argument is that Imperial is full of
sad idiots who do nothing but work
and look at computer screens all
day. The aforementioned sad idiots
do not like washing and definitely
do not know what girls look like...
or maybe a few of them actually
are girls. The Imperial argument is
that all medics are stupid, arrogant,
public school boys. Now can anyone
see where the arguments fall down?
No? Really?
Right, well I think it comes down
to stereotypes, and also the people
you notice. Who do you notice when
you’re walking down the street? The
normal people, the loud obnoxious
people, or the losers? That’s right,
you notice the people who are out
of the ordinary. The vast majority of
people, on both sides of the fence,
are ordinary, nice people – the peo-
ple you said hello to on your first
day, before the seething rivalries
sank their teeth into you and pulled
you apart.
Now I’m not saying that rivalries
aren’t good. They are great for keep-
ing spirit alive in the university, and
for giving a little bit of light-heart-
ed competition and banter (or not
so light-hearted in the case of the
Varsity match, as was so helpfully
demonstrated by the supporters last
Wednesday evening). But seriously,
do you really want a football derby
atmosphere? With riots breaking
out, screaming children, and burn-
ing houses? I thought not, but if
you’re not careful, it could very well
happen at the next sports night; and
not just in your own befuddled head.
So, in order to try to stop such a
thing, let’s look at the arguments...
1. Imperial students are sad losers
who do nothing but book work and
look at computer screens all day.
It’s difficult to accuse someone
of that when they are in the pub
with you. It’s especially difficult to
get into a drunken fight with one
of them. Yes, some people do work
extremely hard and do not tend to
venture out into the wild world of
socialising. However, these people
are few and far between – if they
don’t socialise they cannot breed,
and so gradually over the years this
species has gently hit a dead end. An
evolutionary cul de sac, perhaps.
But still, Imperial cannot be that
dull if Brian May did physics here.
Just remember, that complete ‘loser’
who never leaves his room might
well be writing the next Bohemian
Rhapsody. Or he may be a serial
killer, whittling spinning tops out of
human tibias. Best not to provoke
them.
All people who go to Imperial (all
of it, including the medical school)
are clever and quite swotty, so
before the medics accuse Imperial
of being sad, it’s mirror time. Oh,
and Imperial people tend to stop
being a student earlier – by getting
jobs. Which means proper clothes. I
would love proper clothes!
2. All medics are loud, vulgar,
obnoxious, fat, stupid, rich snobs.
Now, I think you’ll find that most
of those adjectives only apply to a
select group of people, who I will
not name (think of a club... begins
with R... ends in Y...), and even these
guys and gals aren’t exactly that bad,
only when they get drunk togeth-
er. But nights when this happens
(sports nights etc) are well publi-
cised, and if you find that behaviour
offensive, you can avoid the throngs
of sweaty drunk men (or not, as you
like).
These guys are not always like
this, and most importantly they
aren’t the majority. Even allowing
for that though, it’s always fun to
watch them for a while, and some-
times it’s nice to be part of such
mayhem.
On the topic of stupidity, med-
ics are not stupid – hell, they do
have to get some pretty good grades
to get into Imperial, like everyone
else here. They may not have the
in-depth knowledge of astrophys-
ics that someone doing astrophysics
might have, but that’s not the point
of medicine, especially at under-
graduate level. You need to learn
a very large range of things to suf-
ficient detail so that you don’t kill
people, and occasionally help some.
That’s it. No specialist knowledge
until you graduate.
That’s why medicine is difficult,
it’s the sheer volume of facts you
need to know, not the difficulty of
each individual one. There is no
abstract mathematical theorem
involving 20 dimensions. There are,
however, about 40 billion pages of
textbook to read. Which is partly
why they tend to drink more heav-
ily – there’s so much more random
crud to forget.
But also don’t forget that med-
ics are here longer (unless you do
a PhD, or a few masters courses)
so they might be a bit upset at still
being students...
In other words, what I’m trying to
say is... friendly rivalry, yes. Angry
banter/attacks/slagging off, no. Until
next year’s Varsity match anyway.
Medics vs Imperial vs Medics vs Imperial
by TRISTAN LANE
Using conventional wisdom, and
general Imperial female experi-
ences, it is most generally the male
party in an intimate situation that
tends to avoid the female post-alco-
hol-fuelled-rumpus until he is con-
fronted post-avoidance with anger
and strife. This week, Stormy Woods
is taking on the role of the very
same men she despises so intently.
I just don’t get it. Which part of
“we’ve just gone out for a drink,
not as a couple” does he not under-
stand? Older men are supposed to
be more with it – more frank, play-
ing fewer games, and respecting
more boundaries. Clinginess, week-
end DIY and marriage plans are so
not where I’m at. I kept to Dr Ruth’s
advice – date different types to see
what works best for you – and this
is what I get. Constant calls when
I’d told him I’d call him when I was
comfortable with seeing him again.
He only got the hint when I changed
my telephone number.
Let’s talk a little background here
– Nick is a 32-year-old Asian enter-
tainment tycoon. He owns a port-
folio of properties littered around
London, and drives a Porsche
Boxster. I met him at a media pro-
fessionals networking event, for the
launch of Smooth FM. We got on
well, he asked me out for dinner, and
we somehow ended up at a Lloyds
bar in London.
He’s tall, dark and cute to look
at, with lightly tousled hair and an
Austin Reed suit. He’s responsible
for providing me with most boring
date in history; and having proved
himself pompous, insecure and
arrogant, he decided to con himself
that I would fall for his materialistic
smarm. That’s right, in order to add
insult to the injury caused by asking
whether I was homosexual on three
separate occasions, he dropped the
biggest clanger – he flashed his
tie at me, and said: “Ted Baker”.
To make things worse, he jangled
his watch and went “Hugo Boss”,
and tugged at his suit lapel, before
saying “Austin Reed”. I was visibly
unimpressed.
He continued by telling me about
his properties, which he spent the
weekends doing up. He’d not been
out in six months – no gigs, no exhi-
bitions, no sightseeing, no evening
classes – shocking. Even more
astounding was the fact that I didn’t
get a word in edgeways, having to
learn about his customised BMW
ZX3, his trips to Café de Paris and
his issues with my appearance, in
particular my hair being tied up!
Had he not paid for my Western plat-
ter, I’d have got up and left. Thank
God my best friend “got dumped”
otherwise I’d have killed myself by
choking on an overcooked chicken
bone. I’m shuddering at the thought
of him as we speak. Ugh.
Hmph. Nick is not the only guy I’m
avoiding. Somehow, I’ve managed to
acquire a few unwanted admirers
around College. I don’t know wheth-
er it’s my inimitable charm, or the
unrivalled paucity of my irreverent
banter; it’s quite easy to beat me
in the visual department, since I’m
not conventionally attractive by any
standards.
I can’t walk into South Kensington
without bumping into someone who
has, in previous years, pre-court
injunction, followed me home. It’s
difficult to turn up in College once a
year to pay my tuition fees without
being accosted along the way by
one of the countless spotty, greasy
excuses for men who see me as
their dream girl. Sadly, they don’t
have the perceptiveness to realise
they’re not ideal for me. Since when
have holey jumpers been cool? Since
when has wearing the same holey
jumper for weeks on end been cool?
What about bathing, what about
hygiene, and washing clothes?
Accents are another point of dis-
pute. I hate guys who don’t realise
that having an alluring Lancastrian
accent does not make the content
of their speech interesting. “I got
trollehd whaal my bro woz taykin’
a wazz”. If visually stimulating,
they’re good for a quick pull and
nothing else. Sadly, good-looking
men seem to think that’s all they
need to keep a woman happy – per-
sonality is just chilli sauce on the
kebab.
What’s more amazing is that the
unconventionally attractive Miss
Woods has got the air-headed piece
of unbelievable aesthetic pleasure
best known as the purple dinosaur
finding limp excuses to turn up at
her door and chat to her flatmates.
He feels that roses, badly written
gothic poetry, childish drawings and
heart-shaped chocolates are the
way forward. The way forward to
a psychiatric unit, more like, for
assuming I’d take to such tacky
demonstrations of affection that a
pre-school object of affection would
have the good sense to reject!
I’m surprised most women fall for
these things come Valentine’s day
anyway – it’s meant to be a day of
celebrating your partner and their
worth, something you could do with
their company alone. Lisa Simpson
is right: “Romance is dead. It was
acquired in a hostile takeover by
Hallmark and Disney, homogenized,
and sold off piece by piece.”
