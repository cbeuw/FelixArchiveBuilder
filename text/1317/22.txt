Southampton 385
Imperial 382
By Sam Dash
Once again we set off to a
faraway place to challenge
another formidable enemy.
This time it was Southampton
University Rifle Club, who
won last years BUSA small-
bore championships and
shoot four times more often
than we do.
We set off in our usual
style, with plenty of time, and
arrived before the opposi-
tion. We had with us a team
of eight people, including a
strong four man team.
The Southampton team
finally arrived, and we were
shown around their small but
pleasant range. We got shoot-
ing straight away, with the
details carefully worked out
so that two members of each
team were shooting at the
same time. Time went by with
both good and bad scores
being registered. Eventually
it was clear that we were loos-
ing, but only by a small mar-
gin, which we were pleased
about. The overall match
score was taken as the top
four from each team, giving a
maximum score of 400.
We were even more pleased
when we realised that we
had time left to have a bit of
fun. We decided to have a fun
shoot... a very rapid fun shoot.
We shot ten rounds in 60 sec-
onds. This is a pretty hard
task, which explains why the
top score was only 66 out of
100, not 98 as it had been in
the previous shoot!
We then retired to a pub
to enjoy a buffet of tasty
cheap food and beer. The
Southampton team were
even kind enough to get us
a couple of bottles of wine for
coming second! Most of the
team returned to London that
evening, but a few stayed to
experience the student night-
life in Southampton.
All in all, it was a great
afternoon of shooting, despite
our narrow loss. Hopefully
this will become an annual
event and I am sure that we
will meet them again next
year – hopefully to win.
Bristol 3
Imperial 1

On 22 January, the Imperial
clay pigeon shooting teams
took part in their first ever
friendly against Bristol
University. Having set off
from South Kensington, the
journey was uneventful until
we reached Membury serv-
ices, perhaps partly due to a
large proportion of the team
nursing hangovers. The serv-
ices proved revitalising and
we continued the voyage after
a 20min heated ‘discussion’
over which route to follow the
rest of the way.
We arrived at Bristol’s reg-
ular shooting ground just in
time to witness the start of
a lovely Westcountry shower
that would last the remain-
der of the day. The Bristol
team turned up half an hour
later and after a short con-
frontation with the manager,
over the fact we brought our
own cartridges, the fun com-
menced.
The stands, located within a
small wooded area, were var-
ied and proved challenging
for all. At the end of the 50 bird
sporting, each of the Bristol
teams were ahead, apart from
the ladies’ team. To finish the
day, the men’s teams shot a
flush – 80 clays launched from
an elevated position in front
of you and shot as a team
of four guns. Whilst Imperial
proved stronger in this dis-
cipline than Bristol, it would
not be enough to change the
leader board and Bristol won
the day 3-1.
Despite the result, the day
was thoroughly enjoyable and
a great practice for when we
shoot against Bristol again
at the BUSA Championships
next week.

In the quarter-final of the
ULU Football Men’s Reserve
Plate, Imperial Fifths took on
ICSM Thirds for the chance
to achieve cup glory and
prove their footballing pedi-
gree in what has always been
a grudge match.
Despite transportation
problems, the Fifths finally
reached Teddington to
encounter very windy con-
ditions and an ICSM Third
team with only ten men. It
was clear from the off that it
was going to be a game of two
halves. Despite the numerical
advantage, the experienced
Fifths were not complacent
and set their stall out early.
Control of the midfield was
vital and the IC players gave
103% to achieve this.
Within ten minutes, an
event rarely seen in football
occurred. The medics’ goal-
keeper hit a peach of a goal
kick that was urged on by
the wind. The ball bounced
on the edge of the IC penalty
area and continued towards
goal, flying in just under the
crossbar.
After realising that this
must have been divine inter-
vention to give the medics a
head start, the Fifths began
to show why they have such a
good record in ULU Division
2. Daniel Knott demonstrated
his class as a box to box
player, being first to the ball
all over the shop. Urged on
by captain and winger Osman
Ozturk, the Fifths started to
demonstrate their calibre by
stringing together a number
of intricate passes. The sexy
football continued until a
period of pressure resulted in
IC’s French prodigy Clement
Audoin clipping a cross in
from the left. The ball landed
at the grateful feet of top
scorer Cemal Akcaba who
stroked it into the bottom left
corner for the equaliser.
At half time, Oz used his
usual tactic of threatening
each player to motivate them.
Knowing his violent past, the
Fifths needed no more rea-
son to finish the game off.
The IC dominance continued
in the second half with more
football worthy of the ‘beauti-
ful game’ being played.
More chances were created
and before long there was a
breakthrough. Oz swung in a
corner from the right that was
majestically hammered home
by centre back Mike Nikolich
from close range, making
it two-one to IC. More pos-
session turned into another
goal soon afterwards. Once
again, Oz got the assist as he
clipped a through ball past
the medics’ defence to leave
Clement with a golden oppor-
tunity, which he calmly took
as he tucked the ball past the
‘keeper.
The Fifths were all over the
medics like a rash despite the
arrival of their eleventh man.
New signing, Nicaraguan
goalkeeper Lester, did not
touch the ball in the second
half, and that is not an exag-
geration. The final nail in the
coffin came about 15 min-
utes from the end, as Adam
Masters played a ball across
the medic penalty area to find
Danny Wilson in space. Wilson
cut inside and drilled the ball
into the bottom right corner
with the ferocity of a crazed
wild animal. The last ten min-
utes were quite scrappy but
nothing could detract from a
well earned four-one victory
for IC Fifths.
A special mention must
go to the back four, includ-
ing the Fifths’ most consist-
ent player, Sami ‘the beast’
Taipalus, who is the subject
of nightmares for any striker
who has played against him.
The organisation and techni-
cal ability of the defence has
been a strong foundation for
this IC outfit to build on.
Once again, Imperial pride
was defended, but a rematch
looms as these two sides will
face each other in the league
very soon. A good perform-
ance here saw the mighty
Fifths march on to the semi-
finals.
