Wye students want answers
College management will finally address Wye students on the changes affecting
their campus, but this may not be enough to satisfy a disgruntled majority
By Nichola Hawkins
Wye correspondent
This Monday, the Deputy
Rector of Imperial College,
Professor Sir Leszek
Borysiewicz, will travel to
Wye to speak to students.
The event, arranged at
the request of Wye College
Union Society President
Dawinderpal Sahota when
the Deputy Rector met with
him in January, will be the
first chance Wye students
have had to hear from those
involved in determining the
future of their College.
The Deputy Rector has
been tasked with the restruc-
turing of the Faculty of Life
Sciences, a process set to
result in the closure of all
but one of the undergradu-
ate courses (BSc Applied
Business Management) at
Wye.
The lack of information
given to students so far has
caused resentment amongst
the Wye population, as have
the proposals themselves, as
demonstrated by responses
to the Union’s recent online
survey.
This resentment was par-
ticularly apparent during the
recent sabbatical election
hustings at the Wye campus,
at which students seemed less
concerned about quizzing the
candidates than about asking
some questions of the current
president and his deputies.
Questions came thick and
fast, on issues including mini-
bus provision, club funding,
the Union’s dissociation from
the Wye Beagles club and the
losses made by Imperial’s
summer balls when Wye’s
own ball is expected to break
even. But the main issue of
the evening was, inevitably,
the restructuring and the
future of the campus as a
centre of learning at Imperial
College.
When security came to lock
up the building at midnight,
many questions remained
unanswered and students
pointed out that some of their
colleagues who had not been
so interested in the hustings
might also like to hear about
the future of Wye. As a result,
Union President Mustafa Arif
has also arranged to visit Wye
on Monday, and he will be tak-
ing questions.
The Wye College Union
Society will be holding their
own question and answer ses-
sion this evening (Thursday).
Whilst Wye students will
hopefully welcome this late
gesture towards communica-
tion, many are disappointed
that the Deputy Rector does
not intend to take students’
questions. Furthermore, the
Rector’s face-to-face event at
the Wye campus, which last
year took place during the
Easter holidays, has yet to
be announced for this 2004-
5 in spite of the College’s
Spectrum intranet saying
that an event will take place
at each campus over the aca-
demic year.
The proposed closure of
most courses at Wye was
announced in August. Some
students first heard about the
plans through the national
press while they were at home
over the summer, although
the College has said that this
was due to information being
‘leaked’ by staff unions.
The Department of
Agricultural Sciences subse-
quently issued a statement
guaranteeing that all cur-
rent students would be able
to complete their degrees at
Wye, but longer term infor-
mation has so far been signifi-
cantly less forthcoming.
The Department of
Environmental Science and
Technology and the Division
of Biomedical Sciences will
also be significantly affected
by the restructuring process,
but with less drastic changes
for biology and biochemistry
students.
An angry Wye student questions Imperial College Union officers about the future of his
campus at the recent election hustings. Wye students will be keen to discover more about
the College’s plans for the campus when the Deputy Rector visits next week

Mustafa Arif, President of
Imperial College Union, faces
a motion of no confidence at
an emergency Council meet-
ing tomorrow evening.
The motion, proposed by
Tom Tibbits, a postgraduate
in the physics department
and member of the Union’s
Executive Committee, alleges
that the President is “guilty of
gross misconduct and breach
of the constitution and regu-
lations”.
A paper calling for greater
accountability was passed
by the Council in December
(see Felix 1310), mandating
the President to give various
explanations and responses.
Bad management at elec-
tions, an under-represented
Executive Committee and
unauthorised increases in
costs were just some of the
issues raised. Mr Tibbits
argues: “The President’s
response was inadequate,
and along the lines of ‘there’s
not enough time to do eve-
rything so you’ll just have to
trust me as a leader’.”
The motion claims that Mr
Arif is “demonstrating an atti-
tude that is inconsistent with
the Union’s status as a stu-
dent-led democratic organisa-
tion.” It also makes other alle-
gations against the President
and his style of management
which cannot be released for
legal reasons.
Mr Arif said: “I’m happy to
receive and respond to criti-
cism done in the right way.
I think the author [of this
motion] and his supporters
should think long and hard
about whether all this silli-
ness is in the best interests of
the Union as a whole.”
Mr Tibbits claims that
the President is running
the Union “in a very elitist,
undemocratic, uninclusive
way.” He told Felix: “We [the
students] cannot tolerate
leadership that doesn’t take
us into account.”
The motion requires a two
thirds majority of Council
members. If it is passed, Mr
Arif would be suspended for
one month on full pay and
accommodation, and then
dismissed.
Mr Arif may appeal against
the Council’s decision, but
he would need to call a gen-
eral meeting attended by at
least 200 students within five
College days. This meeting
would then have the final say.
Union President may
face dismissal
Mustafa Arif at a recent
Union Council meeting
By Dave Edwards
Editor
Next year’s Imperial College
Union President, Deputy
Presidents and Felix Editor
were elected last week.
The turnout reached a
record high of more than 2800
votes – over 22% of the stu-
dent body. Mustafa Arif, the
current President, expressed
his pleasure at the turnout,
saying: “The Union is now
in a much stronger position
to legitimately represent stu-
dents than at any time in its
history.”
Sameena Misbahuddin, the
current Deputy President
(Finance and Services) was
elected as President, over-
coming her nearest chal-
lenger Morten Olesen by 1126
votes to 862 after the other
candidates’ votes had been
reallocated.
Ms Misbahuddin told Felix:
“I was delighted to be voted
President and I’m looking for-
ward to it immensely. There’s
a lot of work ahead, as always,
but I’ll do my very best to
justify the faith of those who
supported me.”
Tim Aplin will be the new
Deputy President (Finance
and Services), with 930 votes
to 510 for Edward Piggott and
289 for Re-Open Nominations,
after Robin Avery had been
disqualified.
Simon Matthews was elect-
edasDeputyPresident(Clubs
and Societies) by 816 votes to
672 for James Thatcher after
votes for a new election had
been reallocated.
The new Deputy President
(Education and Welfare) will
be Sarah Khatib, who over-
came Aleks Corr by 911 votes
to 802 in the final round.
Rupert Neate was elected
as Felix Editor with 962 votes
to 668 for Darius Nikbin after
the other candidates’ votes
had been reallocated.
Ms Misbahuddin’s cam-
paign was largely based on
her experience as a Deputy
President, but the option of
taking a second sabbatical
year may not be available
to future candidates, after a
paperrestrictingtermsofsab-
batical office to a maximum
of one year was passed by
the Union Council last week.
Since the paper proposes a
constitutional change, it must
still be passed by a second
meeting of the Union Council
and by the College Council
before it comes into force.
