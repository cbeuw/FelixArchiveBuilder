Recently, while splayed out
on the chilly floor of the
Somerset House ice rink, it
occurred to me that my skat-
ing abilities might improve if
I understood a little more of
the science.
Let me tell you up front in
case you harbour vague hopes
of rescuing gauche and medi-
ocre ice rink performance by
reading this article: knowing
the science will not save you
from your cold watery doom.
But, fear not, such knowledge
will almost certainly deepen
your ice skating experience
and after all, isn’t a richer,
more enjoyable encounter
with the substance what it is
all about?
The reason ice skating can
be so much fun is because ice
has a uniquely low coefficient
of friction, which is why skat-
ers can glide so effortlessly
across it. So the prime ques-
tion, then, for any aspiring
scientific ice skating enthusi-
ast is: what makes the ice so
slippery in the first place?
The pressure myth
exposed
The classic explanation was
to attribute it to pressure.
The pressure of the skate
blade was said to melt the
surface of the ice, causing
a small layer of water to be
formed. This created a lubri-
cant, lowering friction. When
the pressure was removed,
it was thought the ice froze
over again.
Certainly it sounded pretty
plausible and for a number
of years no-one much both-
ered to investigate. Certainly
it is true that increasing the
pressure on ice will lower
its freezing point. When you
put pressure on ice, you are
essentially trying to squeeze
it into a smaller space.
Because water takes up less
space than ice, the liquid
form becomes more favour-
able than the solid form. The
more pressure, the greater
the inclination for the ice to
become water. The property
manifests itself in the lower-
ing of the freezing point when
ice is exposed to high pres-
sures.
But while all this is eminent-
ly sensible, it is not enough to
explain why ice is slippery.
The problem is that it
requires enormous pres-
sures to lower the freezing
point of water significantly.
Consider a simple calcula-
tion. Now I don’t want to give
away my life ambitions, but
let’s suppose I am an Olympic
champion figure skater with
a mass of 60kg (plus three
gold medals). My sharp skate
has 2cm² of contact area. The
entire pressure exerted by
my skate is only just under
30 atmospheres. Which, when
you apply something called
the solid-liquid coexistence
curve in the water phase dia-
gram, equates to a tempera-
ture drop of only a few tenths
of a degree.
Indeed, it turns out that you
need to apply a pressure of
about 120 atmospheres just
to lower the freezing point
of water by 1°C. Note also
that 120 atmospheres of pres-
sure would likely shatter the
ice! So according to this the-
ory you would only be able to
skate on ice which was just
below freezing. But the ice we
generally skate on is much
colder at below –5°C.
If it is a bit early in the
morning for all this, just think
of light objects like hockey
pucks or small children. They
can glide as frictionlessly as
adults. If pressure was the
reason for slippery ice, this
simply wouldn’t be so.
The current theory
So what is going on? The prob-
lemseemstohavebeensolved
in the late 1990s by a chemist,
Gabor Somarjai, and a physi-
cist, Michel Van Hove, of the
Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory in California, who
studied the slipperiness of ice
on an atomic scale.
According to them, the ice
itself is intrinsically slippery.
You don’t need to melt the ice
to skate on it because the ice
has a ‘quasi-fluid layer’ that
coatsthesurfaceandprovides
a permanent lubricant. When
pressure is applied, the mol-
ecules in the layer compact
into underlying interstices, or
spaces in the ice structure,
and create a smooth surface
for easy gliding.
The ‘quasi-fluid layer’ is not
actually liquid water but ice
molecules vibrating very rap-
idly. The ice molecules have
an unusually high degree of
vibrational motion, several
times that of the molecules
deeper in the bulk of the ice.
But importantly it is only in
one direction, up and down.
If the atoms moved from side
to side, the ‘quasi-fluid layer’
would literally become liquid
(which is what happens above
0°C).
Somorjai and Van Hove
investigated the phenom-
enon using a technique
called electron diffraction.
They bombarded a thin layer
of ice with a stream of elec-
trons. Detectors recorded the
angles and velocities of the
electrons reflecting the ice.
Surprisingly, they didn’t fol-
low the simple trajectories
expected of an object bounc-
ing off a solid state. Instead
they were scattered, as if hit-
ting a constantly changing
surface.
The ‘quasi fluid layer’
may be thicker or thinner
depending on the tempera-
ture. Lower temperatures
give rise to fewer layers
whereas if the ice is warmer,
the number of slippery layers
increases. At around –20°C
the ice drastically decreases
in slipperiness so it just about
resembles any other solid. At
just under –160°C, the layer
is as little as one molecule
thick.
As to why ice is so slippery
compared to other solids, this
is thought to be because the
chemical bonds that hold the
water molecules together are
much weaker than the bonds
joining other solids.
‘Fast ice’ vs ‘slow ice’
The phenomenon may help
to explain the difference
between ‘fast ice’ and ‘slow
ice’, terms sometimes used
in ice hockey games. ‘Fast
ice’ is harder and colder with
a smoother surface, while
‘slow ice’ is warmer and soft-
er. Hockey players generally
prefer ‘fast’ ice because the
passing and skating is easier.
Figure skaters prefer softer
ice for their landings.
Based on the theory, as
the ice temperate increases,
skaters need to move through
a greater number of ‘quasi
fluid layers’. Hence more fric-
tion occurs slowing the skater
down. The extra layers also,
no doubt, cushion falls – even
if you do still get wet.
Ice-skating: just how do skates glide on the surface of ice?
The science of ice skating
It’s not too late to enjoy a traditional winter sport. But do you understand the
physics involved? Zoë Corbyn elaborates on the motto, “know thine ice”
News
in brief
Mars pictures
reveal frozen sea
A huge, frozen sea lies just
below the surface of Mars,
a team of European scien-
tists has announced. Their
assessment is based on pic-
tures of the planet’s near-
equatorial Elysium region
that show plated and rutted
features across an area 800
by 900km. The team think a
catastrophic event flooded the
landscape five million years
ago and then froze out. They
tell a forthcoming edition of
Nature magazine that sedi-
ments covered the ice, locking
it in place.
Intel builds first
continuous laser
with silicon
Researchers from Intel have
created the first continu-
ous laser beam using silicon
components, a development
that could herald significant
advances in communications
and medicine. Researchers
overcame the problem of two-
photon absorption by using
a technique from the world
of semiconductors: it created
positive and negative regions
around the path of the laser
light, which “vacuum” away
electrons and provide a clear
road for the laser.
NASA sets space
shuttle launch
date for 15 May
NASA has set 15 May as the
launch date for the first shut-
tlemissionsincetheColumbia
accident two years ago. “The
challenge right now is clo-
sure of an awful lot of paper.
The vehicle can’t launch until
all the paperwork is done,” a
spokesman said. The board
that investigated the fatal
2003 Columbia accident rec-
ommended NASA make 15
changes before resuming
shuttle flights.
Test for canine
personalities
Dogs show huge differences
in personality, according to a
US scientist who has devel-
oped a test to assess canine
character. Dr Sam Gosling,
of the University of Texas,
rates the dogs on four key
traits with positive and nega-
tive extremes. He adds that
his work suggests pets should
be matched with owners who
have similar personalities.
The work was presented at a
major science conference in
Washington DC.
Felix guide to resurfacing an ice rink
● Temperature of ice for hockey is about –9° C
● Temperature of ice for figure skating is about –5.5° C
● The vehicle that you see on a rink after a skating
session is called a Zamboni. It is a mechanical ice re-
surfacer. To resurface, it uses the following procedure:
1. Scrape the ice surface and collect the resulting
‘snow’
2. ‘Clean’ the ice by putting down water to loosen any
dirt from grooves
3. Collect the excess water and dirt
4. Apply a thin layer of heated water that
freezes and creates a new smooth surface
