I built Southside
“So, at long last, Southside is
coming down. After all this
time it has outlived its useful
purpose and has to go. Good
riddance say most of you –
perhaps a few are nostalgic,
but for me its demise has a
special meaning as I actually
helped build it.”

Smoke free
bar on trial
By Dave Edwards
Editor
Smoking will be banned in
Da Vinci’s Bar for a three
month trial period beginning
on Tuesday 1 March, Imperial
College Union announced this
week.
The bar, on the South
Kensington campus, will be
smoke-free all day every day
during the trial period, and
the ban will be enforced by
staff.
The idea was proposed and
passed at the Trading and
Retail Committee, following
suggestions from students via
the Union’s strategic review
process and ‘Yoursay’ feed-
back forms.
Sameena Misbahuddin, the
Union’s Deputy President
(Finance and Services), told
Felix: “The trial will be used to
make a decision as to whether
there should be a permanent
non-smoking outlet. We need
to get student feedback and
assess the social and finan-
cial impact of the ban.”
A senior member of Union
staff voiced opposition to the
proposals: “I know of no other
university that has tried this
and met with a positive out-
come. There has been very
little discussion or investiga-
tion into this whole subject.”
Ms Misbahuddin said:
“Other unions have tried sim-
ilar things – some working
and some not – but we can
only give it a go and see how
it works in practice.”
Felix spoke to students in
Da Vinci’s earlier this week,
and opinion was divided over
the issue.
Timothy Brinded, in his first
year of an electronic engi-
neering course, said: “It’s
probably a good idea to keep
some sections smoke-free...
when this place gets really
packed, it’s quite smoky, and
some people don’t like it.”
Another first year student,
a smoker studying chemical
engineering, had a different
point of view. She told Felix:
“I think they shouldn’t ban
it. A lot of people smoke in
here, dBs isn’t as nice, and
the Union Bar isn’t as wel-
coming.”
A government White Paper
on public health, published in
November last year, outlined
plans to outlaw smoking in all
pubs serving prepared food
by the end of 2008. Smoking
will be banned in workplac-
es and most enclosed public
areas, but will still be permit-
ted in pubs which limit their
food sales to snacks such as
peanuts and crisps. Private
members clubs will also be
exempt from the ban.
Dr John Reid, the Health
Secretary, said: “People do
not have the right to dam-
age the health of others... We
will ensure that people will
be able to go to their work-
place, or choose to go out for
a meal or a drink, without the
damage, inconvenience or
pollution from second-hand
smoke.”
Simon Clark, of smok-
ers’ group Forest, said: “We
vehemently oppose what has
become a systematic attempt
to demonise smokers.”
The national chain JD
Wetherspoon recently
announced plans to ban
smoking in its London pubs
from May this year and
nationwide from May 2006,
ahead of government regula-
tions.
