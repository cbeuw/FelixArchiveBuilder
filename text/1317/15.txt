their roots and brought us their genre-hopping new record

ALBUM REVIEW
With the invasion of R’n’B into every
aspect of the music industry, pow-
ered by the stream of exciting new
acts that continues to flow out of
America, British dance is suffering
a recession.
Glastonbury saw one of Orbital’s
last gigs, and popular support for
Underworld and Basement Jaxx is
waining, despite some awesome live
performances.
One of the greatest British dance
acts, with a constantly evolving
sound, is the duo, Tom Rowlands and
Ed Simons, two ex-medieval history
students who met at Manchester
University in 1988. Push the Button
is the brand new album from the
Chemical Brothers, who were initi-
ated into the mainstream by 1999’s
Surrender with tracks such as Hey
Boy, Hey Girl and Let Forever Be
debuting high in the charts.
The album follows the Brothers’
history of collaborations, including
Richard Ashcroft, Noel Gallagher
and Bobby Gillespie, by kicking off
to a flying start with a helping hand
from the talented Q-Tip (A Tribe
Called Quest) on Galvanize. This
extrovert rampage is the first sin-
gle from the album and has topped
download charts since its release.
The track immediately shows the
genre-bending nature of Push The
Button, making some purists feel
the Chemical Brothers have flown
off course.
Come Inside is a demonstration
of the initiative used throughout
the record. Touching on old school
with chilling vocals, huge electro
bursts and thundering bass hooks,
the track evolves into a hyperactive
mix of build-ups and breakdowns.
It finishes by blending into The Big
Jump, a rollercoaster of electronica
frenzy and a sampling master class.
The industrial sounding Believe
moves the album in a fresh direc-
tion, featuring up-and-coming Bloc
Party’s Kele Okereke on vocals,
exploding out from a beat heavy
shell with a potency only rivaled by
The Prodigy.
One of the hidden gems on Push
The Button is the phenomenal Hold
Tight London, brought to life by
Anna-Lynn Williams’ (Trespassers)
vocals and has more than a pass-
ing resemblance to the sounds of
SneakerPimpsandAir. Reminiscent
of Underworld but with vision never
heard before, Incubus-style whale
noises top off a surreal, 5am experi-
ence. By the time you reach Surface
To Air, yet another job well done, the
album is over. A guitar-ballad versus
dance track finale, it has awe-inspir-
ing finishing touch sound effects
that leave a warm glow inside.
It might sound corny saying there
is something for everyone on the LP
,
but I will anyway, from the military-
themed hip-hop joint that is Left
Right, featuring milky bass breaks
and the vocally dexterous, Jay-Z-
sounding Mos Def, to the Casio
keyboard dedication from the eight-
ies, Close Your Eyes. That’s not all
– the Brothers have also tried to
latch onto the R’n’B/crunk fad with
Shake Break Bounce, incorporating
retro Space Invaders samples into a
rapid bare beat and Spanish guitar.
Unfortunately this becomes a brief
let down in the middle of a great
album, trying too hard and end-
ing up as a poor trip-hop wannabe.
Probably the most unexpected ele-
ment on the album is the slide blues
guitar that plays throughout the
penultimate track Marvo Ging with
surprisingly great results.
Thereareplentyoffivestaralbums
about but the careful construction of
Push The Button is on another level;
seminal it most definitely is. A joy
to listen to, it is a display of amaz-
ing album composition, an all but
forgotten art that barely features on
any modern releases. Rowlands and
Simons suck you into their world
from the first bars of the opening
track and don’t let go for the whole
60-minute journey; something I had
to repeat straight away. The sound
of Push The Button will haunt clubs
for years to come. It is an instant
classic and benchmark for albums
in the vague vicinity of the dance
genre.
The welcome return of The
Chemical Brothers, once more
changes the way we look at music.
Not only will the plethora of rock,
indie, rap and hip-hop vocalists
on the album add to the universal
appeal but they help The Chemical
Brothers raise the bar in what
seemed a drained genre. Admittedly,
with exception to Galvanize, the
album lacks the vocal catch phras-
es symbolic of previous works and
there is an overwhelming sense
of refinement, which might not be
to everyone’s taste. The Chemical
Brothers have also run the risk of
overwhelming the listener by incor-
porating a vast range of influences
to the album, but looking back it felt
like a natural progression. The live
show experience has certainly made
the Chemical Brothers more aware
of the pressures of follow-up albums,
but I love this production. Clean but
not clinical, it provides a healthy
shot of dance that we all need.
Drawing from their contemporar-
ies such as Faithless and Leftfield,
Rowlands and Simons have built
on experience, creating something
a bit special: a summary of why
British dance is undoubtedly the
best in the world. A defining exam-
ple of their previous work Push The
Button is not, but it does everything
else you’d expect from veterans of
the festival circuit.
So if you don’t have tickets to their
upcoming show, go and find a tout
because it will the best laser-fest
you’ll ever go to. But if being pum-
melled into submission by one of the
most sublime live shows around isn’t
your cup of tea, there is no excuse
not to own the album, whatever
you’re into. Matthew Hartfield

The Marble Index are huge in Canada, but over here they merit little more than a gig at the
Betsey Trotswood, capacity 60. Felix questioned them closely on fame and booze
LIVE REVIEW
This is a very strange occurrence.
On the other side of the Atlantic,
Canada’s The Marble Index would
be playing venues equivalent to
the Astoria here, or even Brixton
Academy when supporting bands
like The Pixies. Here they’re play-
ing The Betsey Trotswood, a lit-
tle underground cavern where I
patiently sit through David Gray
wannabes The Motorpool, with
about five other people. Five! There
are people in Canada who would kill
for this opportunity.
Instead of going through the
motions in what they confess to
being the smallest venue they’ve
ever played, The Marble Index treat
it as a chance to let off some steam,
and rip through a devilishly noisy
set.
So what do they sound like? The
‘garage’ term gets lazily thrown
around a lot, that sound of 2002. Is
that fair? Sure, they have the ener-
gy and presence of The Datsuns,
but not the fret-wankery or massive
boredom factor. They also have the
melodicism of The Vines, but with
out a spastic spoilt-kid singer. In
fact, a good genre I’d stick on them
would be (whisper it quietly) new-
wave.
A new-wave garage band, you
scoff! Whatever next, punk-funk?
It’s not instantly obvious as they
launch into A Lot Of These Things,
with Brad’s lazy Canadian drawl,
but then you notice that Ryan is
attacking his bass in a way I could
only describe as angular.
As they yelp their way through
single I Believe and the melodically
brilliant Not So Bright, you can see
how The Marble Index have built up
such popularity. These are rocking
tracks that would not sound out of
place on the radio, albeit XFM or
the likes.
I’m desperately trying to decipher
what I have written about the rest of
the set, but a mixture of excitement
and LOUD seems to have turned
my careful journalistic musings into
something deposited by an inebriat-
ed spider. I think I’ve written “Holy
no! Disco bassline! What are his
hands doing?” in conjunction with
We Can Make It and, rather confus-
ingly, “Nice! Chords above the 12th
fret + rawk. Bleeeed!” for the furi-
ous finisher Creamin’.
Most certainly more than a one
trick pony, seriously sharp rock plus
what I can only describe as inhuman
bass lines equals a band on the up.
It’s only a matter of time before they
win England over too.

INTERVIEW
The band have been called “electric
garage pop”, but they’re not too
keen on that description. Brad (gui-
tar/vocals) told me: “I don’t like the
whole garage connotation, because
it implies everything that came out
around the time of The Strokes. We
kinda have a rough sound, it isn’t
meant to be really shiny or clean,
but I wouldn’t go as far as garage.”
Adam (drums) sees it differently:
“With pop together it almost fits. I
don’t think you could call it pop on
it’s own, or garage on its own. If
you’ve got to label it I guess garage-
pop is OK.”
Those cursed words “The Next
Big Thing” have been bandied
around when describing the band.
Ryan (bass) said: “We started hear-
ing it at the beginning of 2003, there
was some hype in Canada.” They
laugh. “It’s better than saying ‘the
next piece of shit’!”
They’ve described themselves
as “the real deal”, although they
don’t seem to remember who said it.
Adam elaborates: “I think when we
said ‘the real deal’ we were refer-
ring to the fact that we’re not faking
it, what we do is genuine to us, it’s
what we really want to do, we’re
not doing it to fit into a scene. It’s
honest.
“We came together on our own, we
weren’t put together by any higher
forces,” adds Ryan, before a discus-
sion about Busted ensues.
Just to give you have an under-
standing of how huge they are, this
band have toured with the Pixies.
Out of all their support slots, they’ve
found that the highlight.
Brad: “I think musically our
favourite had to be the Pixies. The
Dears are mates of ours, so it’s
always good to see them, and Hot
Hot Heat was good, but that was a
while ago.” They’ve been playing
huge venues recently, Brad says:
“Most of them were between five
and nine thousand capacity.” Adam:
“We felt comfortable there.”
Brad has been heard to say “every
time the booze is free flowing, we
always get into some trouble!”
They laugh nervously. Brad elab-
orates: “We’re paying for it [the
booze] tonight! That’s the way it is,
when the booze just keeps coming
you people just say things... I’ve put
my foot in my mouth a few times,
I’m sure I’ve made some enemies
when I was sauced up. I’m sure we
all have, but when it goes free, we
all seem to take advantage of the
freedom of alcohol!”
They even have their own label,
‘Death Of Records’. Brad explains
that its mostly for putting out their
own stuff: “Somewhere down the
road, if things go well, we wouldn’t
rule out trying to sign other bands,
but right now, it’s just for our own
thing.”
Incredibly, they recorded the
album in Wigan. That’s Wigan,
England. “There’s a great producer
there, John Kettle [Moco, Roller,
Tuuli]”, Ryan explains.
Adam: “We went there to test
some stuff out, and we really liked
working with him [Kettle] and the
studio. I’m sure we could have gone
other places if we wanted to but we
felt really comfortable there. That
was the main reason for going to
Wigan.”
Asked to comment on this, ahem,
constructive criticism, “This is
an album for those who get their
rocks off on indecipherable lyrics
and annoying guitar. For everyone
else it’s just an expensive coaster
of suck”, they laugh, before finally
responding.
Adam: “You know who wrote that?
It was that huge Nickleback guy [a
fan, I presume, not just a big guy
from Nickleback).”
Brad: “In context, if you take it
from someone whose favourite band
is Nickleback, then I don’t really
mind. I wouldn’t expect someone
to be a fan of Nickleback and us. It
doesn’t really throw me off.”
