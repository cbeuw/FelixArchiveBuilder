First, let’s set the scene.
Sometime last June, a room
is filled with the leading lumi-
naries of Imperial sports.
Taking place are the initial
discussions of bringing foot-
ball into the festival of sport
that is the annual Varsity con-
test between Imperial and
our medic counterparts. At
some point, the ICSM repre-
sentative turned to the com-
mittee and said: “The football
will be excellent, it’s always a
close game between us and
their firsts.”
Ein minuten bitte! Last
season we played our medic
friends three times, winning
comfortably on each occa-
sion, with an aggregate score
of 14–2, the last match being a
7–1 mauling – close?! But hey,
we didn’t mind, if the medics
thought they’d win, then all
the more fun it would be.
However, whilst an easy vic-
tory was expected in the days
leading up to the game, ten-
sions were high and rumours
were rife of medic ringers.
Did someone spot Ashley
Cole in a St Mary’s hospi-
tal waiting room? As it was,
the only ‘ringers’ were Steve
Morgan and Elliot, both bona
fide medics, and, inciden-
tally, both present during last
year’s 7–1 thrashing.
And so to the game itself:
at this point, if the reader
is a medic, they are advised
to give up now, as it all goes
downhill from here...
After a hectic opening ten
minutes, giant Finnish centre
back Kimo fired a 60 yard ball
into the path of the flying Sri
Lankan Mathan, who squared
for tapir-look-alike Oli to tap
in from six yards.
Minutes later, Tweedman
whipped in a corner from the
right, but Pat Farr had clearly
decided that scoring was just
too easy. Instead, he directed
a powerful downward header
to the now stationary Oli, who
raised a hoof to deflect the
ball into the goal.
With the pre-match nerves
now well and truly dispersed,
Imperial’s football started
to flow. Timur combined
with Berks, before intel-
ligently switching the play
to Imperial’s right, and into
Mathan’s territory. This time,
the mercurial winger pulled
out an outrageous nutmeg
to get to the by-line, before
firing a cross-cum-shot that
the hapless ‘keeper could
only spill into the net. Three-
nil, and the boys in blue had
barely broken into a sweat!
More was to come, and goal
four was the best yet. This
time, Chris ‘my left foot could
perform surgery’ Woodcock
pinged a superb through ball
to guess who... yes, who else
but Mathan. Running onto the
ball, he barely broke stride in
lofting a precocious first time
lob from 25 yards over the
advancing medic ‘keeper.
Finally, just in case Imperial
thought the first half couldn’t
get any better, Javier ‘the
bull’ smashed home a 30 yard
free-kick to leave the score at
a resounding five-nil at the
break.
With the game already over
as a contest, it was natural
that the second half would be
a something of an anticlimax.
However, there were still two
important matters to resolve.
Firstly, Mathan’s hatrick,
and secondly Berksy’s as yet
unopened account for the
season.
Some tenacious play from
JR – actually it might have
been Woodcock but I’ve
already mentioned him twice
and JR deserves a mention
for being awesome through-
out and looking like a rock
star – forced the ball through
to Timur. He rounded the
‘keeper but could only strike
the post from an acute angle.
TheballreboundedtoMathan,
who thought, “instead of com-
pleting my ‘trick, why not bag
another assist”, and laid off
to Berks, who drove the ball
home in jubilation.
Such unselfishness could
not go unrewarded, and the
Imperial crowd did not have
to wait long for the final coup
de grace. After some intricate
possession football, stand-in
right back Les Dennis played
the ball into Mathan’s feet.
With his back to goal and three
defenders in attendance, the
danger to the medics looked
minimal, but having turned
his first man and nutmegged
the second, Matty pulled the
ultimate playground trick
out of his locker. Yes, the
Sri Lankan wizard knocked
the ball one side and ran
around the other side of the
last defender, before slotting
into the corner to complete a
breathtaking treble of goals.
He might look like a goat, but
boy this lad can play!
At seven-nil, the game was
all but done. Certainly Carlos
did not deserve to concede,
but with an eye for symmetry,
Imperial saw it fitting to give
away a last minute penalty,
which provided the smallest
of consolations to the medics.
So, seven-one again, maybe
lightening does strike twice?
Well, one thing is certain:
congratulations go to every
Imperial player, not one of
whom didn’t play his oppo-
nent off the park.
Finally, there is one serious
point that needs clearing up.
There has been a lot of talk
of ‘hating’ medics. On behalf
of Imperial firsts, I would
like to go on record as say-
ing: we don’t hate medics. In
fact, we quite like them. After
all, they’re just footballers.
And besides, we play them,
we beat them, we get three
points. If only we could play
them every week!

Comfortable win for Imperial football Firsts

Men’s 2nd 1
By Ian Robinson
Much fuss has been made in
recent times of the supposed
rivalry between Imperial
College Football Club and
their medic counterparts.
With a recent record, how-
ever, of 15 victories and one
draw in IC’s last 16 matches
against the medics, the
rivalry was beginning to look
as one-sided as Arsenal’s
local rivalry with Leyton
Orient. This was evident the
previous Saturday when IC’s
reserve team looked to have
ended any hopes of the med-
ics being represented in ULU
Premier League One with a
4-0 demolition of their Firsts.
With this result in mind,
IC’s captain Pricey was a lit-
tle worried that his players
were going soft and would
take pity on the medics’
inability to play football. In
order to combat the problem,
he dropped many of his star
names and brought in some
of IC’s third team players to
freshen up the side.
After a rousing team talk
reminding the players of the
importance of winning the
inaugural football Varsity
match, the new look IC
Seconds took to the pitch with
their minds focused on the job
at hand. It was expected that
the medics would be fight-
ing equally hard to get their
hands on the trophy for the
first time, and this proved to
be the case during the open-
ing exchanges. It wasn’t long,
however, before IC began to
exert their superiority with
Caruso uncharacteristically
heading over when unmarked
from six yards and Dom
Booth forcing a good save
from the opposition ‘keeper.
When the resulting corner
was not properly cleared,
John Slavin took control of
the ball for IC before laying
off for Andy Kosinski to volley
home exquisitely from a wide
angle.
With a one goal lead, IC
began to feel a little too com-
fortable and immediately
took their foot off the gas to
allow the medics back into
the game. A well worked long
throw routine caused chaos
in the IC box after it was
not properly cleared, and two
men appeared unmarked at
the back post to fight over
who would slot it home.
The next 15 minutes con-
tained little drama as both
teams sensed they could win
the game and fought over
every ball in the centre of
the park. IC finally edged
ahead with only a few first
half minutes remaining, when
Jan Marchant took control
of a Caruso pass inside his
own half and went forward
unchallenged before rifling
into the bottom corner from
around 30 yards out. The
score remained two-one until
half time.
The second half began
with a renewed effort from
the medics to get something
from the game, but the tight
IC defence kept them at bay
with solid work in particular
from Will MacAdie and Tom
Trump. A goal-line clearance
from Caruso was the nearest
the medics came to scoring.
As the half drew on, the
medics began to tire and IC
started to assert themselves
on the game thanks to some
solid work in centre midfield
from Andy Easter and some
teasing runs from substitute
Dal. A breakthrough finally
came for IC when some neat
play between Dal and Matt
Gready released John Slavin
to calmly slot the ball home
from 15 yards out. At this
point, the medics realised
their dream was over and IC
took firm control. A cameo
appearance from John Scott
should have yielded further
goals but twice he failed to
hit the target when it seemed
harder to miss.
The final result was prob-
ably a fair one and the med-
ics should be commended
for their brave and spirited
display. With the first team
result already in the bag for
IC, all that was left of the
afternoon at Harlington was
for Caruso to pick up the foot-
ball Varsity trophy on behalf
of the club and head off to
Richmond for several beers,
some singing and, er, oh yes,
some rugby.
