I built Southside
After over 40 years, the Southside halls of residence will finally be demolished this summer.
Paul Rogers looks back to 1962, when he helped build Imperial’s favourite concrete monolith
So, at long last, Southside is com-
ing down. After all this time it has
outlived its useful purpose and has
to go. Good riddance say most of you
– perhaps a few are nostalgic, but for
me its demise has a special meaning
as I actually helped build it.
Fast backward to June 1962. I’d
just finished my first year, was living
at home in East London and needed
some money. My dad was an iron-
monger and spare-time builder so
I’d learnt a few things and reckoned
a labouring job on a building site
was just right. Rumours were rife
of the cash to be got – the Victoria
Line was being excavated and some
said you could make 20 quid a week
(£300 in current money and twice
what most casual jobs paid then),
so I set off for Central London to try
my luck.
It turned out that the Victoria Line
wasn’t interested in students, but
there were loads of office blocks
going up all over the City, so pros-
pects looked good. Time after time,
though, the site foremen said they
wanted experience, even for labour-
ing, and hours of fruitless searching
left me thoroughly daunted. By mid-
afternoon I thought I’d at least try my
luck around South Ken. The whole of
Imperial College was like one vast
building site – physics and chemi-
cal engineering were completed, but
most of the engineering buildings
were still being worked on.
So, too, was Southside. It was up
to roof height but was a hive of activ-
ity with a couple of hundred people
working on site. More to the point,
the contractors were prepared to
take me on, provided I’d work a 60-
hour week for £17.50 including site
bonus. That was more than good
enough compared with bar work or
anything else around, so, for that
summer, I left home each day at
6.30am, travelled across London and
worked from eight until six every
weekday and eight until four on
Saturdays.
The work involved anything and
everything – sometimes totally bor-
ing, other times great. Best was
working as a labourer for the car-
penters doing second fixing in the
penthouse flats on the top floor.
Great views over London, a good
gang to work with, and the foreman
so far away in his site office that he
only checked up on us a couple of
times a day.
Some of the other work was soul-
destroying. For one week, I spent
the entire time chipping away at
excess plaster at the base of the
bedroom walls so that the skirt-
ing boards would fit. Several times,
through sheer boredom and care-
lessness, the hammer slipped out
of my hand. Once it went over my
shoulder and chipped the under-
neath of the hand basin. If whoever
is in room 421 looks under the basin
and spots a chip, that means they
never did replace it.
The bane of all our lives was
Norman the foreman, always on
the prowl and ready to “stop you a
quarter” (15 minutes’ wages) for the
smallest infringement. Perhaps he
was only doing his job, but the one
saving grace was that he knocked off
at noon on Saturday, leaving a hand-
ful of workers on site for the last
four hours of the week. Work would
be set but it is astonishing how fast
really well-motivated labourers can
work. We’d usually get everything
done in a couple of hours, with the
rest of the afternoon spent sunbath-
ing on the roof or throwing stones
at the rats that would venture out
from under the floor of the canteen
hut ten floors below, where Linstead
Hall now stands. Does Linstead
have rats? If so, they are probably
100 generations down the line from
those original colonisers.
At the end of the summer it was
back to student life, and Southside
opened the following year, to much
acclaim and appreciation (yes, real-
ly). I actually got one of the rare
postgraduate rooms in the place a
couple of years later, and greatly
enjoyed it, perhaps because of the
added satisfaction of being just that
bit possessive about it.
Now, after 42 years and over 15,000
student residents, it is all coming
down, to be replaced by some bit
of ‘modern’ architecture that prob-
ably won’t last nearly as long. An
added irony is that my youngest son
started at Imperial last October and
is living in Southside as one of the
last ever residents!
So it really ended up a bit of a
family affair, and, when you watch
it coming down, spare a thought for
one old Imperial lag, because just
one little bit of my life will be coming
down with it.

It’s time to speak out
“First they came for the commu-
nists, and I didn’t speak up because
I wasn’t a communist.
Then they came for the Jews, and
I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t
a Jew.
Then they came for the trade
unionists, and I didn’t speak up
because I wasn’t a trade unionist.
Then they came for me, and there
was no one left to speak up for me.”
Martin Niemöller, German pastor
On 2 and 3 March, the next stage
of Babar Ahmad’s extradition
hearing takes place at Bow Street
Magistrates Court, near Covent
Garden. As Babar’s wife said at an
‘End the Occupation of Iraq’ stu-
dent teach-in held recently at LSE
and attended by many Imperial stu-
dents, the family are “hoping for the
best, but expecting the worst”.
This article is a call for everyone
in Imperial to come with myself,
our president Mustafa Arif and
many others in the official Imperial
College Union delegation which is
meeting at 9am in Beit Quad on
Wednesday 2 March to join Babar’s
family and supporters in a demon-
stration outside the court. This is
not just an act of solidarity, but a
chance, through large numbers, to
continue to put pressure on those in
the legal system who will be making
a decision about Babar’s future.
This demonstration will be pre-
ceded by a showing of the recent
BBC documentary about Babar’s
case, which will be introduced by a
member of his family and shown in
SAF Lecture Theatre 2 at 6pm on
Monday 28 February.
As I have pointed out many times
before, this case is not just about
Babar, and it is not just about
Muslims. It is true that Asian peo-
ple, immigrants, and ethnic minor-
ity groups are being targeted, vic-
timised, and used as scapegoats
inthe current climate of fear sur-
rounding the ‘war on terror’. Tony
Blair’s recent pathetic apology to
the Guildford Four should highlight
how it was previously the Irish who
were treated in this way in Britain.
But it is also true that restrictions
on rights to demonstrate, the intro-
duction of ID cards and many other
moves towards a ‘police state’ are
things that will affect each and every
one of us.
I had my own very small taste of
this clampdown last Tuesday, as I
ended up sitting in a cell for several
hours in West End Central police sta-
tion. I had been arrested for breach-
ing Section 5 of the Public Order
Act, and, apparently, assaulting a
police officer. Neither of these things
were true, and as my solicitor later
confirmed after I had been released
without charge, I had been arrest-
ed for two reasons. Firstly, it was
the National Day of Disobedience
against the occupation of Iraq, and I
was therefore holding a megaphone
on a demonstration that directly
challenged the Government, and
which they therefore wanted to stop
as soon as possible. Secondly, laws
are currently being considered to
ban demonstrations (and the use of
megaphones) in Parliament Square,
and an arrest for violent conduct
would help that case enormously.
Sitting there, the first thing I
thought about was Babar Ahmad.
Now, I am not trying to compare my
situation with Babar’s on any level,
or to complain about my ‘traumatic
experience’. But I did think, if they
are prepared to do this to a white
British male, imagine what it must
be like to be arrested as an ethnic
minority, or an immigrant, or anyone
else who is unfairly victimised and
targeted by our state and its police
force. And, I thought that sitting for
three hours in a cell is not particu-
larly pleasant, even when you know
you are soon going to be let out. At
the time of writing, Babar has been
in prison for 4810 hours and faces
extradition to a country with the
death penalty, for a ‘crime’ which
there is not sufficient evidence to try
him for in Britain. Imagine how that
must feel.
I appreciate that many people
reading this may not have expe-
rienced directly the full force of
what we have come to call ‘jus-
tice’. Neither have I. But I would
encourage anyone who is in princi-
ple against what is going on in the
world today, to stand up and oppose
it. Whether it is the anti-war demon-
stration on March 19, or the demon-
stration at Bow Street Magistrates
Court on March 2, you must speak
out. Because even if you have never
met Babar, or don’t think that any
of these things have anything to do
with you, who will speak out when it
is your turn?
