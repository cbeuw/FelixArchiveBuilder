Every once in a while I go to the
theatre and see a production and I
stagger away drunken with excite-
ment and say to myself, “This is
why I love theatre, this is why I am
here.” Tejas Verdes at The Gate
theatre is the most recent pro-
duction to give me those feelings.
Right off, I’d like to apologise – I
have nothing bad to say about this
show. Tejas Verdes is 70 minutes of
monologues performed promenade-
style. So ladies and gents keep your
knees bent and relaxed (three peo-
ple fainted during the performance
I saw and it was rather distracting).
Tejas Verdes, meaning green
roofing tiles, was the Auschwitz
of General Pinochet’s regime in
Chile. This torture and detention
camp was in use for almost a year
and could hold up to 200 prisoners.
The audience is taken on a journey
following a young girl through her
torture. Colorina, played by Shereen
Martineau, is a fictional charac-
ter that playwright Fermín Cabal
created based on real testimonies
given by torture survivors in Chile.
The all-female cast of five could
not fail to move you. Martineau
plays Colorina intelligently and you
always want more of her. The other
characters are people that have been
touched by Colorina in some way.
Diana Hardcastle playing both
The Friend and The Informer
gives you a heart-wrenching
look at how terrible it can be to
befriend someone and give them up.
Gemma Jones, who is known
from such films as Bridget Jones:
On the Edge of Reason, delivers
an amazing performance as The
Gravedigger. Her eyes are pierc-
ing and it’s impossible to look away
as she describes her personal sick-
ening encounter with Colorina.
While it seems impossible, Tejas
Verdes gives the audience a new
look at torture, torturers and tor-
ture victims. The verbal descrip-
tions of methods of torture are
nauseating on a level that paral-
lels with the film Schindler’s List.
Don’t go for happy fuzzy warm
feelings, be prepared for gut-
wrenching, heart-tugging disgust.
Even if you don’t go for the act-
ing, or the new look at torture, the
set and its designer Dick Bird do
definitely deserve your applause.
If anything, this remarkable rendi-
tion of a forest is vivid and strik-
ing. Tree trunks dripping with
sap surround the audience, while
standing on several centimetres
of soft dirt and cobblestones. As I
walked into the dark theatre, I could
smell the outdoors and I clutched
my overcoat, as I felt transported
out of London into a chilled forest.
The play closed on 19 February,
but a new run has been announced
for March. If you didn’t go the first
time round, you missed an experi-
ence, one that would have stayed
with you forever, don’t miss your
second opportunity.

Gut-wrenching
Tatum Fjerstad goes beyond the West End
Free time: how to spend it, if
you still remember what it is
OK, so I’m feeling a little jaded and
worn out: term grinds on as it always
does, and the work load isn’t getting
any lighter, in fact the thought that
there aren’t even four whole weeks
of term left is becoming a truly
frightening prospect! However, what
is really getting to me is the fact
that I’m missing out on so many
great opportunities to see exhibi-
tions and performances. Due to end
of term ‘scheduling issues’, I’m hav-
ing to give up my ticket for second
part of Wagner’s Ring at the Royal
Opera – with my luck, I’ll never hear
Terfel’s Wotan! That was my rant,
I’ll move on now.
There are a number of exhibi-
tions on in town these days that
really ought to be seen. At the Royal
Academy, Turks is currently run-
ning, (I have managed to see this
and a review will soon follow), and
what looks to be a fabulous Matisse
exhibition will soon open. Turks is
a massive exhibition charting the
cultural and artistic influences that
found their way into what became
the Ottoman Empire over a thou-
sand years. Much of it is spectacu-
lar. The Matisse exhibition, opening
on 5 March, will be a somewhat
less physically taxing affair as it will
be housed in the smaller space at
the Academy, the Sackler Wing. The
exhibition will include many of the
artist’s vividly colourful paintings
and, exceptionally, also a number of
textile works.
The Tate Britain currently has the
highly acclaimed Turner, Whistler
and Monet exhibition on. This charts
the influence of Turner’s work on
that of the two rivals. This runs until
15 March.
In terms of performance arts,
don’t forget to look out for the really
good student offers from the London
Philharmonic. The run of Beethoven
symphonies is over, as are a series
of concerts putting Sibelius centre-
stage, but there is still a lot more
out there. Check their website www.
lpo.org.uk for programme details as
well as the offers. Paola Smith

Garbo and Monroe, Dietrich and
DiMaggio, now it’s your turn. Here’s
your chance to strut your stuff on
the catwalk as a model or as a fash-
ion designer in a 21st century eco
style.
The ‘Re-dress Yourself’ project,
being organised and led by Central
Library librarian Nadia Aref-Adib,
some of her colleagues and the stu-
dents’ union, aims to highlight the
possibility of recycling household
waste into fashion items, be they
clothes or accessories.
The project encourages the pos-
sibility of self expression, environ-
mental awareness and fun through
(re)creating fashion from recycled
waste. It’s a chance to redress the
balance between what we perceive
as waste and what we can do to
ensure a sustainable future for our
planet, moving away from the cur-
rent throwaway culture.
The fashion show will be held on
Monday 14th March 2005 at dBs
Bar, Beit Quad. Doors will open at
6pm, and the parade will begin at
7pm. We will advertise for design
teams and/or individuals from the
local College community. Each team
or individual will design a piece of
clothing or an accessory from any
kind of recyclable waste, for exam-
ple, junk mail, bubble wrap, plastic
bottles or old clothes. The possibili-
ties are of course endless.
The aim of the night is to have fun,
to express ourselves and to raise
awareness. The project team want
to encourage all members of the
College community to come togeth-
er for this event. So start collecting,
get organised and think big, bold and
daring. Proceeds from the event will
go to TRAID, Textile Recycling for
Aid and International Development.
Tickets for the event are priced
at £8, £4 students/concessions.
There will be prizes for the top three
designs. All you need is your own
imagination...
