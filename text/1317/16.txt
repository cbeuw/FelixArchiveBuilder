CLUB REVIEW
The last time I went to a party that
had been hyped as much as Type’s
fourth birthday was when I went to
see Fat Boy Slim at Turnmills last
year and I had a terrible time. The
fact that I had flu was no help, but
the main problem was that there
were way too many people.
The Cross is a much smaller venue
than Turnmills, with about half the
capacity, and with a line-up includ-
ing Audio Bullys, Seb Fontaine and
David Guetta in the main room and
support from the likes of Wes in
room 2, there was good reason to be
worried that I might spend six hours
jammed between some fat, sweaty
chav scum.
My girlfriend chatted up the pro-
moter during the week and guaran-
teed us six guest list spots, but three
of the party immobilised themselves
long before the security search
became relevant. The rest of us
were pleased to find, however, that
as ‘guests’ we were quickly ushered
inside with the minimum of fuss.
My fears about overcrowding were
justified as a constant flow of people
between the rooms made it impos-
sible to find a place to settle unless
you could handle the freezing wind
in the garden. It is said that over
50% of the people moving around in
a club have absolutely no idea where
they are going, and we spent most
of the first hour just moping around
and leaning against walls. However,
once the Audio Bullys took the decks
we were fortunate to find ourselves
in an enclosed area adjacent to the
main room with convenient bar
access, comfy seats and more than
enough room to move.
I had never heard the Audio Bullys
before, but their set really justified
their billing and their name. The
crowd were driven to the point of
euphoria by some uplifting funky
house and then suddenly, without
warning, the Audio Bullys played
What A Difference A Day Makes, a
song that sounds more like a lullaby
and certainly had the less empa-
thetically challenged declaring love
for new people. The pattern con-
tinued with a big drop followed by
99 Red Balloons and finally Bang
Bang (Baby Shot Me Down) from
the Kill Bill soundtrack which made
emotional wreckage of anyone who
had let the Bullys get on top.
Seb Fontaine was next up and
although his set was typically profi-
cient, the club was still very crowd-
ed and I was interested in saving
energy for the last action in the
main room provided by French DJ,
David Guetta.
David Guetta has burst onto the
forefront of the London club scene
with a residency at Type and regu-
lar slots at Turnmills’ City Loud
thanks to the overwhelming success
of his Fuck Me I’m Famous parties
in Ibiza. At City Loud, he played
a flamboyant set including some
funked up electro and some lively
4/4 house music that included some
catchy remixes of well-known tunes,
and his performance at Type was
slick and classy. Guetta whetted the
crowd’s appetite for some old skool
with Smack My Bitch Up but the
set did not really get into full flow
until about 5am when he savagely
dropped Josh Wink’s Higher State
of Consciousness.
The high was sustained as a series
of uplifting diva tracks were reeled
off, including some of Guetta’s own
work such as last summer’s Ibiza
hit Stay.
As the night drew tantalisingly
to a close, the atmosphere in the
main room was electric and when
the promoter failed to bow to crowd
pressure to allow one more record,
the sense of disappointment was
palpable.
Some might say that Type is too
commercial and a bit cheesy and I
had my own doubts, but the venue
turned out to be spot on and the
delivery of a few old favourites real-
ly topped off a quality night. As I
went into the club, the PR smugly
boasted the quality of the line-up
they had that night. The next Type,
on Saturday 12 March, features Seb
Fontaine and Wes as well as the
mulletted German superstar, Timo
Maas. So that should be excellent
too.

CLUB REVIEW
You might remember that last week
I was telling you to get yourself
down to Sub Red. I did, and camera
in hand I even managed to snap a
few of you bouncing around dBs in
the process.
I had been sitting in the Union Bar
for a good few hours before the night
had even started, but was looking
forward to the line up of DJs for the
evening. First up were IC Radio’s
Spindle and Chug, not quite play-
ing back to back but between them
dropping some heavy tunes. Sadly,
as is often the case at the Union,
the room was empty for the first
few hours. Stepping in and out now
and then to check out the tunes, I
was impressed by the calibre of the
music and the mixing on offer. It’s
just a shame there was hardly any-
one around to hear it.
As the night progressed slowly,
people started arriving and filling
the place up. Spindle and Chug’s
set was followed by MacPherson.
The Union’s Venue Manager, and
the brains behind the Sub Red
night, he’s played at such places as
superclub Fabric. His mixing style
is damned fast and involves lots of
quick chops and cuts between beats
and tracks. Bouncy.
Things rolled along nicely in terms
of the music, and drum and bass
sounds bloody good over dBs’ new
Turbosound PA system, complete
with big-ass bass bins to resonate
you inside and out. Gradually more
and more people did arrive, though
the place was far from full. No mat-
ter though – as I always say, the
emptier the room, the more space
to dance around in! The people
here were clearly loving the music,
and giving it plenty of the old D&B
bounce and snap movements.
Finally, headliner and Movement
resident Bryan Gee put in an
appearance. By this time, the place
was about as full as it was going to
get, but there were enough people
here intent on partying that things
like that didn’t really matter. Gee’s
set was suitably honed and enjoyed
by all. The fact that there was vodka
plus mixer for a pound a pop all
night was the icing on the cake of
what turned out to be a top night.
Ok, so the place wasn’t packed out,
and as usual the male/female ratio
wasn’t so great, but in spite of those
things Sub Red is a quality night out
– if nothing else it’s a very cheap
pre-club outing. The only way it’s
going to get better is if more of you
can be arsed to spend time in your
Union. Make some effort and the
only way is up.
