After the highest ever response
(50%) to the Student On-Line
Evaluation (SOLE) from taught
undergraduates, the College has
introduced its next initiative in
direct student feedback, ROLE,
which is for Postgraduate Research
Students.
ROLE, which adopts a similar for-
mat as SOLE, was trialled success-
fully in two departments, encoun-
tering few errors and achieving a
high turnout. It is now being con-
ducted in all departments (apart
from Civil Engineering, as this was
one of the pilot departments) from
21 February to 6 March. All research
students are strongly encouraged
to take part, to improve turnout so
that the College will take student
feedback seriously.
Departments are asked to take
comments on board, discuss them
with their student reps, and imple-
ment improvements where possible.
Exercises like ROLE are all part
of the broader context of improv-
ing student representation for post-
graduate students. The College does
want to improve things for students;
it can only do this if it know what
you want!
QAA Audit
As you may now be aware, the
Student Written Statement (SWS)
has been sent off to the Quality
Assurance Agency. Written by the
Union, the SWS represents the views
of Imperial students on a variety of
educational issues, taken from the
questionnaire conducted last term.
The College will very soon be
told which departments are going
to be selected for “Discipline Audit
Trails”, which means “a bit of a nose
around”, in English. You should be
able to tell if the QAA auditors are
coming to a department near you,
as all the staff will be working twice
as hard and looking stressed, and
suddenly, those fixtures and fittings
that have been defective as long as
you remember will be repaired as if
by magic...
Entertain
Come to Entertain, the charity
extravaganza – it’ll be great! It’s this
Saturday, 26th February, and tick-
ets are available from the Union
Reception, Beit Quad. See the ban-
ner on the Union website (www.
union.ic.ac.uk) for more details.
Re-dress yourself
Look out for a great new fashion
show with a difference, Re-dress
Yourself [see page 17 for details].

Everything I want to talk about
this week seems to have something
to do with a certain government
department...
Immigration and asylum
This afternoon (well, yesterday, by
the time your read this) there is
a picket taking place outside the
Home Office, organised by the NUS
International Students’ Campaign.
This will be followed by a lobby
of MPs organised by the Aldwych
Group (the students’ unions of the
Russell Group of leading research-
led universities). The issue at hand?
Visa extension charges for interna-
tional students.
Historically,internationalstudents
have been exempt from charges to
renew their visas. Last year, without
any consultation, the Government
introduced a £250 charge (£150 if
you have time to wait for a postal
application). This caused endless
grief. Now the Government are pro-
posing to raise the charges even
further to £350.
Why are they doing this? Well,
officially, it’s because the Treasury
wants all immigration services to
cover its costs (so the UK taxpayer
doesn’t pay for the administrative
overheads that apply to each visa
application/renewal). This argu-
ment doesn’t quite wash, because
if you apply to the Foreign Office
(whilst you are abroad) you only
pay £36 for a visa. The much higher
charge only applies when you are
already in the UK and wish to renew
your visa. (Yes, you are better off
simply going to Paris for the week-
end and applying via the British
embassy there.)
The real reason for these charg-
es is because the government has
identified international students as
a cash cow to fund its immigra-
tion and asylum policy. The policy
itself (to crack down on the “flood”
of “uncontrolled” immigration and
“bogus” asylum seekers), itself pan-
ders to Tory politicking designed
to pander to irrational xenophobic
fears. How on earth this is all sup-
posed to realise Tony Blair’s stated
desire to make the UK welcoming
to diverse international students is
beyond me.
And finally
Yes, I know we are British ‘sub-
jects’, not ‘citizens’. However, I
am a republican. A hereditary
head of state is a relic of the mid-
dle ages and should be abolished
well before anyone needs to worry
about whether Camilla can become
Queen.

The laughing policeman
Most people will never have any
contact with the police in their lives,
unless perhaps a crime has been
committed against them or their cat
has gone missing.
Sometimes, however, people can
be unfortunate and find themselves
in the wrong place at the wrong time
– perhaps a crime has been commit-
ted close by. In this sort of situation,
the police may spot you and decide
to search you.
When you find yourself in this posi-
tion, it is always good to know your
rights and know what the police can
and can’t do.
What is a ‘stop and search’?
Police officers can stop and talk to
you at any time. But they should
only search you if they suspect you
are carrying:
● drugs
● weapons
● stolen property
● items that could be used to com-
mit a crime.
Why me?
You should not be stopped or
searched just because of your age,
race, ethnic background, nationality,
religion or faith, the way you look,
the language you speak or because
you have committed a crime in the
past. If you believe this is the case,
you can complain.
Where can I be stopped and
searched?
You can be stopped and searched in
a number of areas including:
● a public place
● anywhere, if the police believe you
have committed a serious crime.
If the police have reason to believe
there may be serious violence, then
they can search everyone in an area
for weapons, without needing a
good reason to search each person.
This might happen near a football
ground, for example.
A police officer can stop a vehicle
at any time and ask to see the driv-
er’s licence. If the police have good
reason to think your car contains
stolen goods, drugs, or weapons,
they could search it even if you
are not there. But the police must
leave a notice saying what they have
done.
What happens before a
search takes place?
The police officer must normally
tell you:
● that you must wait to be searched
● what law they are using and your
rights
● their name
● the station they work at
● why they chose you
● what they are looking for
● your right to be given a record of
the search straight away.
If the officer is not in uniform, they
must show you their identity card.
If you are in a public place, you
only have to take off your coat or
jacket and your gloves.
If the police ask you to take off
more than this, then in most cases
they will take you to the local police
station.
Your right to a record
If you are searched, the police must
give you a written record of the
search straight away unless, for
example, they are called away to an
emergency. Alternatively, you can
get a copy from the police station
at any time within 12 months of the
search.
The police must write down:
● your name, or a description of
you
● your ethnic background
● why they searched you
● when and where they searched
you
● what they were looking for and
anything they found
● whether they are taking any
action
● the names and numbers of the
officers who searched you.
The police will ask for your name,
address and date of birth. You will
also be asked to say what your eth-
nic background is. You do not have
to say what it is if you don’t want to,
but this information helps show if
the police are stopping and search-
ing people just because of their race
or ethnicity.
How can I complain?
The police should treat you fair-
ly and with respect. If you are
unhappy with the way you were
treated, you can complain. If you feel
you were treated differently because
of your race, nationality or ethnic
background, you can complain of
direct or indirect race discrimina-
tion.
It will help if you keep the record
that the police gave you.
You can get advice from, or com-
plain to:
● your local police station
● your local police authority
● a Citizen’s Advice Bureau
● the Information and Advice
Centre
● your local Race Equality Council
● the Commission for Racial
Equality
● a solicitor.

article or feel the police have treat-
ed you unfairly, please contact The
Information and Advice Centre.

a crisis. Make the Information
and Advice Centre your one-stop
shop for all your welfare issues.
