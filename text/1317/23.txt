Goldsmith’s
Women’s 2nd 1
The ladies seconds are
immense this season, hav-
ing only lost one match (our
first, and that’s before we
found our lovely goalie Suzie,
the first proper goalie we’ve
ever had). For the first time
ever, we actually have not
just enough players to field a
team, but also reserves!
Victories have come over
many prestigious teams who
have previously thrashed us:
UCL Thirds, Sussex Seconds
and GKT Thirds, to name but
a few! We are also through to
the semi-finals of this years
ULU Cup, having previ-
ously always gone out in the
first round, by winning our
quarter-final nine-nil (six of
which were scored by Eline,
who was sorely missed in
the Goldsmiths match – how
many blokes are worth miss-
ing hockey for, hey?)
Anyway, enough show-
ing off, down to the match
in question. We turned up at
Harlington slightly apprehen-
sive, as we knew Goldsmiths
were top of our BUSA league
and had drawn with the one
team that had beaten us.
However, we had faith in our
solid defending and speedy
attacking to win through once
again.
Unfortunately our faith
was shaken when, seconds
after the whistle had blown,
Goldsmiths tucked away a
swift and solid goal. Luckily it
was enough to shake us into
action and that was the last
that goalie Suzie saw of the
ball, thanks to our unyield-
ing defenders Suzie M, Fiona,
Amanda, Chloe and Maria not
letting a single ball past!
The equalising goal came
soon after though, with Suzie
O knocking the ball past their
goalie and into the corner of
the net. This was swiftly fol-
lowed by Lauren’s ‘goalpost’
sweep to take us into the lead,
then Clare’s stunning strike
from the penalty spot area.
Goldsmiths then got scared,
and pulled all of their play-
ers back into the D, making
it tricky for our attackers to
get in. Anna kept up her val-
iant efforts, running straight
through the Goldsmith’s
defence to try to advance on
goal, supported by Suzie O in
left midfield always running
clear of her marker into free
space for the passes.
Half time came too quickly,
with us still only being two
goals in the lead – not a large
enough margin for our liking!
Thanks to our inspirational
talk from captain Claire
(unfortunately not playing
due to injury – get better soon
Claire, we miss you on the
pitch) we started the second
half with renewed energy.
More goal pie was to swiftly
to follow. Jen started with
another goalpost sweep,
pushed straight through the
goalie. Marianne, having
crossed the ball for that goal,
was then determined to grab
her share of the limelight,
executing a hit from the edge
of the D which hit the mark!
Clare A then went on to take
us up to an even six by scor-
ing her second of the day.
The forwards were excel-
lent at standing on the goal-
posts even though Nush
wasn’t there to remind us all
every 30 seconds!
Huge thanks from all the
team go to Martin, Jon and
Sam for braving the cold and
resisting the temptation of
Harlington’s bar to umpire
for us. You did a great job
guys!
So the Seconds’ current
unbeaten string continues.
We left the pitch on a high,
ready for the joys of a bowling
social with the boys’ Seconds,
a fabulous end to the day!
Special mention must go to
Jen, who suddenly learnt how
to actually hold a bowling ball
properly and proceeded to
beat some blokes (who won’t
be named and shamed here!),
Claire’s fabulous strike, and
Maria for getting quite drunk
quite fast and throwing a ball
backwards! Roll on Sunday’s
match!
St Bart’s Women’s 2nd 0
Imperial Women’s 2nd10
Sunday was a cold cold day,
but still 11 valiant ladies
(plus Captain Claire to organ-
ise us all) met up at South
Kensington tube station
ready to make the long trek
into East London in the most
roundabout way possible,
thanks to the District Line
being out of action again!
In true Imperial style we
arrive late, only to be told
there were no changing
rooms. Rather than strip off
at the side of the pitch, we
opted to change in the toi-
lets of their local pub, and
despite being locked in by
the landlord (it wasn’t open-
ing time yet, we got let in
specially) we still managed
to find our way to the pitch,
where the umpires were try-
ing to persuade some local
kids that they really didn’t
want to be playing football on
the St Bart’s Astroturf.
Eventually the game got
underway, but due to the bit-
ter cold and howling wind,
we got off to a slow start with
the ball coming straight to
our end and the opposition
granted a short corner. But
thanks to goalie Suzie’s fabu-
lous save, followed by Suzie
M’s spectacular clearance,
the ball went hurtling back to
where we wanted it.
Despite valiant efforts by
Jen to keep knocking the ball
into the goal, we failed to find
back of the net until 20 min-
utes had passed, when Eline
scored. This was the inspi-
ration we needed and was
swiftly followed by a second
from Lauren, then another
from Eline herself.
Our half time talk from
Captain Claire was swift, but
to the point, in summary:
“You lot are way better than
the opposition, score more
goals!”
Taking her advice to heart,
we did! Eline completed her
hat trick in style, taking a
forward pass from Amanda
to the centre of the D and
knocking it past their keeper,
Clare A pushed two in from
sharp angles, and Radha
picked up a strong hit out
from the opposition, pushing
it back to Lauren who fin-
ished it into the net.
Anna, not content with
scoring her first goal of the
season, had to go better than
that and scored a hat-trick
to match Eline’s, with one
spectacular goal from a top
D strike. Fiona also scored
her first of the season – not
bad for a defender! Ten goals
in total (count them up if
you don’t believe us!). ‘Most
injured of the match’ went to
Suzie O, who came off worst
in a battle with the ball and
her lip, but being dedicated
to her game (and thankful for
her gumshield) she carried
on playing regardless!
Over yummy food provided
by St Bart’s (in the same
pub where we got changed),
Fiona was named man of the
match and we all went home
happy.

London Winter League 4
By Alex Dunnett and
Su Chian Phang
London Winter League
(LWL) brings together an
eclectic mix of Ultimate
teams from the south east on
even the most cold, wet and
windy of Sunday mornings.
LWL never fails to provide
great spirited contests and,
despite the howling gales,
last Sunday was no exception
as Disc Doctors (DD) pitched
up on Wandsworth common
to prove their worth.
DD1 13
Ltd Release ‘Ladies’ 0
Opening the day’s play with a
huge upwind pull (the equiv-
alent of kick-off), the Disc
Doctors first team asserted
pressure from the start. Their
zonal defence proved impen-
etrable and, combined with
some patient play into the
wind, DD soon cleaned up
the mismatched contest.
DD1 3
Curve 2
After 20 minutes of action,
this game was heading for a
rare frisbee scoreline of nil-
nil. Eventually, though, Disc
Doctors won the first point
whilst trying to throw into
a force 5 gale! Coming back
downwind was a piece of cake
as DD soon doubled their
advantage. A cracking defen-
sive block from Naiff merely
enforced the Doctors’ author-
ity further, combined with the
ever growing consistency of
Kris Wong with the disc in
hand.
DD1 3
Chain Pier Pressure 1
Our third consecutive match
was a spirited affair against
a motley crew of Brighton’s
finest. Another gale had mus-
tered by this point, culminat-
ing in “the comedy moment of
the day” as Stylish launched a
simple five yard scoring pass
which caught the wind and
ended 30 yards downfield!
Despite this minor setback,
DD1 took control and never
let their dominance with the
disc slip.
DD1 2
Sixth Form Falmer 6
Yes, we did get beaten by a
bunch of sixth formers, how-
ever it was our fourth con-
secutive hour of ultimate and
they were helped along by
five of London’s finest play-
ers. We failed to score into the
wind, but still played our best
disc of the day in the open-
ing passes of the game with
Manny in exceptional defen-
sive fettle.
The wind was never going
to allow ultimate quality to
shine through, but a three-
one record for the day showed
DD’s strength. Only five
weeks remain until the South
East University Regionals
– watch this space!
DD2 6
LSE (Equilibrium) 5
DD2’s first match of the day
ended with the right result:
Imperial’s second team beat-
ing LSE’s first team! The
weather conditions meant
that both teams played a lot
of zone defence, however
the experience gained from
recent DD practices helped
DD2 to win the downwind
points quickly and put on the
pressure on LSE’s offence.
Everyone put in a stellar per-
formance and LSE were left a
bit sore by the loss.
6ffu 12
DD2 1
The second match against
6ffu, a team of sixth form-
ers, was obviously DD2’s
hardest game of the day.
Their opponents had several
national level handlers and
more than eager high school
runners to give DD2 a runa-
round. However, both teams
agreed that the point of the
match was a quick, smooth
and downright sexy play from
DD2! A long huck was thrown
over the stack by Finny and
was perfect for a sneaky cut
from G. He was well sup-
ported by hard running from
Lisa and Stas as they made
up ground, giving him options
in the end zone. An easy throw
and a calm catch completed
the well deserved move.
DD2 5
KCL (Thrown) 4
If the match against
Equilibrium was big, DD2’s
match against Thrown was
bigger! King’s ultimate team
practise with DD on a weekly
basis and are good friends,
which made the match even
more important. With Thrown
attacking into the harsh wind,
DD2’s zone worked effec-
tively and efficiently, allow-
ing the Doctors to intercept
and score the first point. It
was a great match and the
game spirit was marvellous
as jokes and encouragement
were passed between the
teams.
Curve 3
DD2 2
This was DD2’s third hour-
long match in a row and legs
were beginning to tire. As
usual, the typical obscure
British weather kicked in and
at during one point it even
started snowing! But a little
bit of snow didn’t stop DD2
from trying to score upwind.
A contested foul on the other
hand did and that meant that
one of DD2’s scores had to be
replayed. The tight scoreline
was an accurate portrayal
of the numerous chances
both teams had. If the match
had been played earlier or if
DD2 had been allowed a
break, the scoreline might
have favoured Imperial’s sec-
ond team. Well, we like to
think so anyway!
All in all, it was an excellent
day for DD2, as we showed
real grit and determination. It
was the icing on the cake that
we finished in the top half
of our group. It will be a sad
time at the end of the year
when many members of the
club will be leaving, (hope-
fully) moving on to better
things. But never fear, there
are definitely more than a
few quality players waiting to
take over!
