A website endeavouring “to
evangelize the world via the
internet with the Good News
of Jesus Christ” has attacked
an article published in Felix
Science in January.
The article, printed in
Felix issue 1310, was enti-
tled ‘Science, religion and a
case of history repeated’ and
described the events follow-
ing the Lisbon earthquake of
1755. It contained the offend-
ing statement: “Religious
priests roamed the streets
hanging people, accusing
them of heresy and blaming
them for the earthquake.”
A reporter for the Catholic
Exchange website has in the
meantime been investigating
thiseventandfoundthatthere
is ‘no historical evidence’
for priests having commit-
ted such acts. Consequently,
the site has accused The
Washington Post, CBS News
and Felix (amongst others)
of ‘journalistic un-integrity’
and running pieces that have
made ‘highly inflammatory
allegations’. Since then, the
debate has spread to various
internet discussion baords.
The role of religion in geno-
cide has always been contro-
versial. The Iberian penin-
sula, in particular, has had a
notorious history of priests
ordering heretics to be
scythed in their thousands.
The Inquisition that began in
the 15th century and only offi-
cially ended in 1834 (when the
last burning took place) was
a period during which many
thousands were killed and
even more were subjected to
torture, usually on the basis
of their religious beliefs and
sometimes because they just
looked a bit odd.
This behaviour should not
reflect in any way on the
modern church or its val-
ues. The Pope has frequently
ackowledged “methods that
had nothing to do with the
Gospel”. But the Catholic
Exchange website seem to
believe that they have to
defend the repute of their
religion through the ages.
They clearly feel any slur on
the name of any priests in
the past is a slur on their
entire religion today. But, in
defending the indefensible, in
beginning to identify with the
brutal religious regimes of
the past, they could become
a part of that history.
There are revisionists
who claim that the number
of deaths inflicted by the
Inquisition has been vastly
exaggerated. But, equally,
there are people who dimin-
ish the number of Jews
killed during the Holocaust.
On the one hand, you have
millions killed for the sake
of purifying a religion, while
on the other hand millions
were killed purifying a race.
In both cases, revisionists
attempt to reroute events to
suit their present day ideo-
logical ends. In both cases,
the crimes should never be
forgotten.
At the same time, people
living today should not feel
that they have to apologise
for the actions of their ances-
tors. They should learn from
their mistakes and not repeat
them; to practice their reli-
gion without imposing their
ideas on other people through
violence.
Throughout history, atroci-
ties have been committed
in the name of God. Kings,
queens and presidents have
waged war with a sword in
one hand and a ‘holy book’
in another, proclaiming the
words of a prophet and impal-
ing their next victim on a pike.
In the modern world, religion
should play a very different,
less political role.
Unfortunately, the articles
published on the website
completely ignored the cen-
tral thesis of my original
article, which was that natu-
ral disasters force people to
question the nature of their
own belief. Whether priests
actually roamed the streets
executing heretics in the
aftermath of the earthquake
is really a moot point. It may
be nothing more than a myth,
but if so, it is a myth that
has gained a great deal of
credence, simply because it
carries with it a great deal of
meaning.

Wendy Brodie has just
had one of her remarkable
achievements recognised. In
between the everyday mini-
miracles of marriage, teach-
ing special needs children,
and raising three kids of her
own, she has managed to
design and produce an inven-
tion.
The Bodyflik is a cheap
and simple device that is
used to sweep water from
your body before using a
towel, meaning that your
towel stays warmer, drier
and cleaner. It won a high
commendation at this year’s
annual British Female
Inventors and Innovators
Network (BFIIN) Awards.
You may not have heard
of them, but the BFIIN has
been running the Awards for
several years. Considering
that their manifesto states
that “the Awards were estab-
lished in 1999 to provide inspi-
ration for women seeking to
turn their unique ideas into
commercial propositions”, it
seems a shame that there
was no fanfare and conse-
quently a complete lack of
public awareness. In fact,
the only reason I know that
this event exists is because
I stumbled across the BFIIN
website.
There is a lack of support
for those in the general public
who have bright ideas. This is
unfortunate, as people with
everyday experience are usu-
ally the best placed to see
how improvements and inno-
vations could be made.
Wendy’s tale begins in a
very normal way – having had
an idea and thinking, “some-
body should really make
that,” nothing much hap-
pened. Nothing happened for
a while. This is where grass-
roots ideas frequently end up:
suspended in limbo in one
person’s head. They do not
have the backing or knowhow
to get the idea going.
Wendy was lucky: a string of
coincidences led her into con-
versation with the owner of
a plastic injection-moulding
factory, John Walters. John
was a self-made man and
therefore fully acquainted
with the struggles required
to get an idea off the ground.
This gave him a sympathetic
disposition towards helping
viable ideas get into produc-
tion.
After a year of hard work
and setbacks, Wendy’s idea
was made flesh and the first
orders were coming in. Ever
since, she has become more
aware of what support is out
there and the agencies that
help people develop their
ideas.
But most people do not
know where these channels
of help are. Wendy is hope-
ful that this may be about to
change – agencies and clubs
are blossoming and becom-
ing more accessible as the
public perception of inventors
changes from solitary indi-
viduals working alone in their
garden shed or attic to ordi-
nary people who go to work.
This could make all the differ-
ence to other inventors who
may not have the luck and
personal support that Wendy
has had from her husband,
Ian.
Inventors’ profiles will also
be raised as they are the sub-
ject of a new reality TV series,
the BBC’s Dragons’ Den.
This is surely the crest of an
oncoming wave, now that DIY
and makeovers have been
done to death. Encouraging
such innovation in Britain
is a good thing – as Japan’s
MITI reports, British ideas
have accounted for 55% of the
world’s inventions over the
last century, and those billions
of pounds are lost every year
when ideas are taken abroad.
With a new consciousness of
our nation’s bright sparks,
perhaps more homegrown
ideas like the Bodyflik will
develop.
Suffice to say that Wendy
is looking forward to the
summer months when
the Bodyflik should real-
ly take off. It is already
on sale through Ebay or
www.bodyflik.co.uk.
The BFIIN Awards are
organised by the Global
Women Inventors and
Innovators Network (GWIIN)
and were held on Wednesday
16 and Thursday 17 February
2005.

Religious right attacks Felix Science
A Christian evangelist website has launched a scathing attack on an article published in Felix.
Darius Nikbin explains how the controversy began and why it should end
“The website has
accused The
Washington Post,
CBS News and
Felix of ‘journalistic
un-integrity’...”
