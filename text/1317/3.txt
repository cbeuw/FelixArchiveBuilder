To the disappointment of
crowds of half term visi-
tors, the staff of the Science
Museum went on strike last
Wednesday to protest erosion
of pay, alleged mismanage-
ment and job losses. Science
Museum library staff also
protested to highlight prob-
lems caused by the planned
transfer of most of their
multi-million pound collection
to Imperial College, and the
related job losses.
Interviewed on the picket
line, Emily Boise, negotia-
tions officer for the union
Prospect, called the 2.5%
pay offer “unacceptable”,
and “well below inflation and
offers made by other muse-
ums”. In an official statement,
the museum countered that
the 2.5% offer was in line with
inflation over the 12 months
covered, and that rises above
inflation had been granted in
previous years.
“I think it’s disgusting that
you should do this during
half term,” shouted on irate
visitor outside the museum.
“I’ve come all the way from
Portsmouth with my son to
help him research a GCSE
project,” he continued.
Chris Chilvers, branch
secretary of Prospect at the
museum,blamedthemanage-
ment. “They’ve known about
this strike for over a month,”
he claimed, “but have chosen
to keep it quiet.”
Chilvers went on to explain
that the immediate cause of
the strike, the dispute over
pay, was the last straw in
what he sees as a string of
problems caused by misman-
agement and government
underfunding.
“We think there has been
dreadful mismanagement of
this museum,” he says, citing
a recent large-scale restruc-
turing as a prime example.
“Many staff feel that they
were wrongly re-graded. It
created a lot of bitterness,”
he claims, adding that it com-
pounded the problems caused
by the lack of any systematic
promotions procedure at the
museum.
The official museum state-
ment argues that the re-
structuring actually served
to bring pay at the museum
from some of the lowest in
the museums sector up to the
national average.
Despite their differences,
both sides seem to agree
that the major underlying
problem is government
underfunding. The museum
claims to have lost almost
£8m in government funding
since 1997. According to the
protestors, this had led to the
closure of ten galleries, eight
permanently.
The current crisis over
ownership of the library col-
lection, which is housed at
Imperial’s central library, was
precipitated by a massive rise
in the rent Imperial charges
to the Science Museum for
use of space for its collection.
As the museum cannot afford
to pay, Imperial has offered a
compromise whereby it will
take control of around 65% of
the library, with the remain-
der being split between the
museum and the British
library.
One of the protestors,
museum-library liaison offic-
er Nick Wyatt, claims that
loss of the museum library
could compromise open pub-
lic access to the collection.
In addition to threatening the
jobs of science museum staff,
the resultant loss of exper-
tise could cause problems for
the many students and staff
who use the collection and
archives.
Clare Jenkins, Director of
Library Services at Imperial
College, counters that the
increaseinImperial’scharges
was simply designed to bring
the charges to the museum in
line with those paid by College
departments. She adds that
Imperial has given a com-
mitment to continue to allow
open public access to the col-
lections after the transfer.

Crisis at the Science Museum
Imperial at the height of fashion
Two students model clothes at the Imperial College Fashion Show, held in aid of Macmillan Cancer Relief
By Dave Edwards
Prominent designers such as
Boyd and Calvin Klein put
their creations on show at
Sunday’s Imperial College
Fashion Show, held in aid of
Macmillan Cancer Relief.
The event, which sold out in
advance, was held at Sketch
in Conduit Street, Mayfair, a
fantastic venue well ahead of
its time.
All the clothes were mod-
elled by Imperial students,
and some students’ own
designs were also exhibited
at the show.
Collections included ‘For
Freetime’, based on urban
streetwear; ‘For Playtime’,
mostly featuring underwear;
‘Sometime’, with wedding out-
fits; ‘Our Time’, designed by
Imperial students; and ‘Night
Time’, featuring evening
wear.
Macmillan Cancer Relief is
a UK charity that works to
improve the quality of life for
people living with cancer. All
the money from ticket sales
was donated to the charity,
raising over £10,000.
Raffle prizes including holi-
days and a signed Chelsea
shirt were given away at the
after-party, and a the overall
total raised is likely to be in
the region of £15,000.
The show was hailed as a
great success.
