Imperial Men’s 1st 8
Imperial Medicals
Men’s 1st 20
By Dave Edwards
In a closely fought match
dominated by the forwards,
Imperial Medicals Rugby
Football Club claimed their
third JPR Williams Cup vic-
tory in three years.
Thematch,anannualfixture
between Imperial Medicals
and Imperial College Rugby
Football Club, was the show-
case game on last week’s
expanded Varsity Day [see
pages 24-27 for further cov-
erage]. It was attended by
Williams himself, a former
Wales international, and an
enthusiastic, partisan crowd
of around 1000.
The Medicals took the
advantage inside the first
five minutes, a lead that
they would hold throughout
the match, as their forwards
brought the ball within five
yards of the Imperial line and
captain Peter Russell crashed
over to open the scoring. Fly
half James Morris missed a
difficult conversion from wide
on the right.
Imperial almost hit back
soon afterwards, as Raphael
Diguisto broke through but
was forced into touch. After
25 minutes, with the Medicals
forwards again applying
pressure inside the Imperial
half, a penalty allowed Morris
to extend the lead to eight-
nil.
Imperial closed the gap
just before half time, as the
backs took play well inside
the Medicals half. The for-
wards took over and captain
Mike Hicks touched down as
they drove beyond the line.
The first 30 minutes of the
second half were tight and
tense, with the two packs
evenly matched and the
score locked at eight-five in
the Medicals’ favour. With
ten minutes to go, it seemed
as though the next score
would decide the game. The
Medical forwards made the
crucial move, applying more
of their relentless pressure
and driving a maul over the
line for Ben Allin to touch
down.
Imperial fly half Jon
Spencer brought his side a
glimmer of hope as he kicked
a late penalty, but deep into
stoppage time Tim Sinnett
had the final say as he darted
under the posts to put the
result beyond doubt. Morris
converted to leave the
Medicals 12 points ahead at
the final whistle – a slightly
flattering scoreline, but the
victory was well deserved.
