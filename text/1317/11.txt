I’ve been feeling a bit guilty of
late, for a few reasons. One of
those reasons, which involves
an unnamed Sabbatical
Officer, a rubber chicken and
the entire cast of Cats, will
remain mercifully untold,
whereas the more pressing
reason is that most of these
articles have used props that
some people may not have
ready access to. After a guilt-
wracked few days and one
moment of inspiration, I’ve
discovered the perfect prop,
owned by (nearly) everyone:
the toothbrush!
WARNING: Whilst great
fun, the following trick can be
dangerous. By trying it, you
are accepting responsibility
for your own actions, and
nobody here is responsible if
you mess it up. If you want
further advice on safety,
please contact juggling@ic.
ac.uk, preferably before
something goes wrong.
Of course, this being
Imperial College Juggling
Society, simple toothbrush
manipulation is not sufficient.
Therefore, in order to make
the photos more entertaining,
this toothbrush will be on fire.
The key is to keep it moving,
since if the toothbrush spends
any significant length of time
pointing upwards, the flames
eat away at the plastic handle
and you’re suddenly holding
a handful of hot molten plas-
tic and chlorine fumes. This
tends to make brushing your
teeth with it afterwards much
more difficult.
As with any activity, safety
is paramount. The important
safety tips are firstly to have
a fire extinguisher and fire
blanket present at all times.
Having a friend present to
help extinguish the flames is
also a good idea, since when
your trousers have ignited
and your pubic hair is heavily
singed, the last thing on your
mind is how to pull the pin out
of the damn fire extinguish-
er properly. The next most
important thing is not to wear
artificial fibres, since they’re
much more flammable and
make you look like a chav
[see picture 1].
Spinning the toothbrush is
relatively easy – start in the
position shown, with the bris-
tles pointing away from you.
Do not apply toothpaste, as it
will get everywhere. Note the
foil between the wick and the
plastic – this is an important
factor in preventing the han-
dle from melting all over your
feet [see picture 2].
Dip the wick in paraffin,
shake off the excess and get
a lighter ready. You may wish
to try a few practice spins
first, to get used to it. Once
you’re ready, light the wick
and start spinning [see pic-
ture 3]. Swing the toothbrush
in a circle that starts with
the handle moving away from
you. To keep it spinning you
must move your finger in a
small, gentle circle – if you try
to do it too fast, it will just fall
off, and whoever catches it
will not be best pleased.
Sadly, this is an experi-
mental art form and we’ve
not quite discovered an effi-
cient way to stop. The cur-
rent method is to either wait
until the paraffin runs out,
or wait until it burns your
finger and you drop it, as per
our blurred, but entertaining
photo [picture 4].
So that’s it. If you fancy join-
ing in with any of our weird
and wonderful juggling activi-
ties, email juggling@ic.ac.uk
and come along on a Tuesday
evening from 6pm at the
Union.

Friday afternoons are great
aren’t they? For a start, there
are still more than 60 hours
to go until the hell of Monday
morning. Plus you have the
maximum duration of week-
end left, with minimum barri-
ers to reaching it.
I spend my Friday after-
noons presenting possibly
the most under-prepared two
hours of programming you’re
likely to hear on IC Radio. The
result is normally amusing,
hopefully entertaining, and at
the very least a harmless bit
of background noise to keep
you company as the working
week draws to a close.
We kick of with the snap-
pily-titled ‘Non-Stop Five at
Four’, which somewhat unim-
aginatively consists of five
back-to-back tracks played at
4pm. Essentially it gives me
20 minutes to try to think of
something insightful to say...
after which I fail to do so.
At 4.30 I’m joined by
Duncan Pearse and André
Refig, to discussthe latestfilm
releases. Our resident critics
always have something to say
about the week’s new movies,
and will hopefully guide you
in your cinematic choices for
the weekend. Thanks to the
marvellous people at Odeon
Kensington, we also have two
pairs of tickets to give away
every single week to some
of our lucky listeners. Simply
answer the disgracefully sim-
ply question, drop us an email
and you could be in for a free
night out.
Inthesecondhour,thestudio
is overwhelmed by the pres-
ence of Matt Cunningham,
whose official purpose is to
deliver the week’s showbiz
and entertainment news,
but it tends to descend into
an all-round chit-chat and
bitching session. The latter
is partly down to another one
of our hastily compiled fea-
tures, the dreaded ‘Scumbag’,
where we consign the week’s
worst offenders to our vir-
tual cesspit of despair. Past
victims have included Kerry
McFadden, Kilroy, the @
symbol and virtually all of the
major supermarket chains.
Sometime before 6pm, the
emperor of the TBR empire
Martin Archer pops in (we
really must get the locks
changed) and tries to plug
his show amidst a verbal tor-
rent of abuse. It’s all in jest...
honest.
We’ll also take a romp
through the week’s papers
and the other issues of the
day.
Musically it’s all over the
place, for which I make no
apologies (it’s my show, deal
with it). It’s mostly main-
stream pop and rock, with a
bit of eighties cheese here
and there, and whatever else
takes my fancy. Your requests,
messages, comments and
abuse are all welcome by text
and email.
So why not kick of your
weekend with me from 4pm,
on 999AM in Southside and
Linstead Halls, on 1134AM
across Wye (thanks to the IC
Trust) or online at icradio.
