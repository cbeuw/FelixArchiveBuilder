This was a first for the
Virgins. As there is no ICSM
women’s rugby team, the
medics and non-medics usu-
ally play on a team together
(as the Virgins), but for the
sake of Varsity tradition we
split ranks to play seven-a-
side rugby.
Due to a few injuries, and a
few less regular players, the
medics recruited some help
from Cocky and Sala, who
have played for the Virgins
before, and Jennie who
played her virgin match.
Captain Felix’s mum was also
present to watch her daugh-
ter play rugby for the first
time.
From the beginning, there
was early pressure from
Felix’s medic side. Good
phase play led to an early
score by Cocky from the wing.
She then missed the conver-
sion, but the medics were up
five-nil.
After the restart, IC captain
Gump and her team applied
good pressure until a turno-
ver forced Killer to race back
to make an excellent cover
tackle and deny Udders a
score. Unfortunately for the
IC girls, Spandex is rarely
kept out at such short range,
and she got the second score
for the medics, which sent
them to half time leading ten-
nil.
At the beginning of the sec-
ond half, Udders was called
to the medics’ three-man
scrum as Captain Kitty was
off thanks to the rolling sub-
stitute system. This call was
obviously a good one for the
medics as more pressure
towards the IC line ensued,
resulting in a virgin try under
the posts for medics debu-
tante Jennie.
The medics continued to
push IC for the remainder of
the match, making good use
of a forced overlap to send
Scotch over for a final try
near the end. Despite the
attempts of the IC team to
snatch a try in the dying sec-
onds with a canny chip for-
wards, the match was over
all too soon with the medics
victorious 20-0.
In the end, Cocky was voted
medics player of the match,
and Gump and Killer shared
the honours for the defeated
IC team. Fineage ensued with
virgin pints also consumed by
Cherrypicker for last week’s
defeat at LSE and Jennie for
her virgin match and virgin
try.
Here’s hoping this new
event can be continued at
next year’s Varsity!

By Pikey
Imperial had prepared so
well... what could possibly go
wrong? Relegation from our
BUSA league the previous
Sunday against Kent after
some dubious umpiring in
deepest darkest Canterbury
had left us highly motivated
to restore at least some
pride to our season by beat-
ing Imperial Medicals Second
XI.
Indeed, the Wednesday
before the Varsity game
had been excellent prepara-
tion, having salvaged a last
gasp three all draw against
Reading Seconds with a typi-
cal ‘cometh the hour, cometh
the man’ goal from Pikey from
about 30cm out.
And so it was that on 16
February the Seconds
met at noon for the quick
dash to Harlington aboard
Mothercare’s yellow fun-bus
for our 1.30pm pushback. We
completed our now legendary
dynamic stretching warm-
up, including sumo stretch-
ing, much to the assembling
crowd’s amusement including
one exceptionally loud medic
girl who seemed to think she
was a comic genius on the
megaphone. Yes, we did have
a girl playing for us… well
spotted, and don’t give up the
degree, love!
And so to the game... as
usual the umpires should
have gone to Specsavers,
but apart from that it was a
closely fought encounter with
some nice play from both
teams and plenty of healthy
banter from the sidelines.
From what I can remember it
involved a lot of Imperial pos-
session and some awesome
defence particularly from
Tyson, who, despite the abuse
raining in from the sidelines,
stood up and took it like a
woman despatching attack
after attack to the safety of
the sideline.
Italian Job, Mr Potato Head,
Dribbles and the Imperial
legend that is Muff Daddy
meant the defence looked
impenetrable. Mothercare
and Brandon Lee attempted
to boss the midfield with their
own special style of whinging,
much like the rest of the sea-
son. Still, consistency some-
times pays!
The wide men, FCUK, our
secret foreign import which
nearly blew the club’s already
overstretched budget, and
James Howard, attempted
to probe and unsettle their
defence. Up front, Pikey
looked isolated at times but
still succeeded in injuring at
least one of their players with
his usual unorthodox tack-
ling.
Andreas and Tight Lips kept
the bench warm, essential on
such a cold day, and rolled
on and off for various play-
ers as the legs tired. In goal,
Alex, fresh from being called
to the centre circle before
pushback at Canterbury to
check that he wasn’t a girl
with his golden flowing locks
the Sunday before, was as
solid as ever.
Both teams had some really
good chances, but the respec-
tive defences kept the opposi-
tion at bay. However, despite
Muff Daddy’s sliding tackles,
Dribbles’ awesome charging
down of short corners and
Tyson’s general ‘nobody gets
through me’ attitude, eventu-
ally the medics carved open
an opportunity following
a short corner and scored,
sending their supporters into
wild jubilation.
Imperial fought back hard
and dominated the second
half and thought we might
get back into it. We nearly
did. Brandon Lee’s drag
flick was heading goalwards
with the ‘keeper beaten all
ends up only for it to smash
into Pikey’s arse as he ran
towards goal.
And so it wasn’t to be. Fair
play to the medics and they
probably deserved to win, if
only because they took their
chance when it came. Well
done to all those who took
part.

Women’s 1st 1
By Hannah Marshall
Ladies’ hockey has histori-
cally seen some bitter bat-
tles fought between these two
Imperial teams. Inkeeping
with recent form, history
repeated itself with Imperial
emerging outright winners.
The first half saw Imperial
dominating play, stringing
together some smooth moves
andpassingeffectivelyaround
the determined medic side.
Imperial remained frustrated
by a solid medics defence,
however, and only managed
to capitalise on one of their
many onslaughts on goal,
making it 1-0 at half time.
An out of the blue reply
came shortly after half time
from the medics, who caught
Imperial on the break to bring
it back level.
Enraged Imperial players
then pushed up the pace,
creating a plethora of great
goal-scoring opportunites,
again denied by an impres-
sive medic goalkeeper who
kept them in the match.
Eventually the breakthrough
came, and Imperial crept one
in. It wasn’t until they were
celebrating the goal and get-
ting ready for the restart that
the umpire reversed his deci-
sion, pressured by the med-
ics defence, who disputed
whether the ball had crossed
the line or not. So it was still
one-one!
As a consolation, the
umpire gave a penalty stroke
to Imperial, which was saved
by the ‘keeper. Imperial
remained unfazed and con-
vinced that, with all their
domination, another goal
would come, and indeed it
did. Within seconds of the
restart of play, Imperial
worked some magic and beat
the Medics ‘keeper at last,
proving that they were wor-
thy of a victory.
More pressure ensued and
the chances kept on coming.
The medics were confined to
their defensive half for the
majority of the match, until an
unfortunate incident saw two
of their players run into each
other. One suffered an injury
to her neck and was taken
away in an ambulance (we’re
glad to report that she’s OK
now) and the match was then
conceded by the medics with
ten minutes remaining on the
clock.
Overallthiswasanemphatic
victory for Imperial, with a
misleadingly close score.
We look forward to the next
clash!
