FREEZE PEACH C O M M E N T
Making my
life great
again
Jian Li Chew takes you through his day
channelling his new idol
A
s I watched
Trump’s inau-
guration cere-
mony at fivesix-
eight, where
I work, and
observed exuberant Ameri-
cans celebrating with cham-
pagne, I got thinking about
my life. It’s been in a rut lately,
just doing my tutorial sheets,
coursework, revising, cooking
my meals, feeling homesick
over Chinese New Year, deal-
ing with crippling insecurity
etc. I needed to do something
to pump some excitement
into my boring life. After
all, you’re only young once.
If you want to win in life,
learn from a winner; spe-
cifically, a man who went
from laughing stock to the
45th
President of the United
States. Inspired by the Don-
ald and the right-wing con-
servative segment of Amer-
ican society, I set about
making my life great again.
I started the next morning
with the most epic break-
fast. I ate all the bacon I
could carry, toast made
from white bread (the whit-
\\ Tomorrow is a new
adventure. A great
adventure. The best.
Everyone says so \\
est bread, so white, no more
liberal hippie sourdough
rye bread) in a special
toaster to imprint an image
of eagles on it and huge
mugs of sweet black kaw-
fee. Not coffee. Kaw-fee. I
ate my breakfast with a gun.
Don’t ask me how I did it, I
just did. I then worshipped
an image of Vladimir Putin.
I went to lectures feeling
SO great. It was awesome,
terrific, the BEST. My lec-
turer talked about climate
change and global warm-
ing. I bellowed that climate
change is a Chinese hoax.
He snapped that almost all
scientists agree that it was
real. I said that it wasn’t.
My fridge was cold. Also,
China. China China China
China China. He said I was
mental. I said it was an alter-
native fact. Suck it. Patriot 1,
liberal snowflake scientist 0.
Another lecturer told me
that I hadn’t submitted the
coursework due last week. I
said I had. He said I didn’t.
I said that it was an alter-
native fact. He said he’d
fail me. I said that I would
graduate with the BEST
grades, so good, so good,
people will say that no one
else is so good.
I went to Honest Burgers
for lunch. I had a YUUUG-
GEEE burger, massive pile of
Freedom Fries and a vanilla
milkshake. It was so great. It
was the greatest lunch in the
history of greatness. Every-
one said so, everyone. It’s
amazing. It’s true. I skipped
my afternoon lecture to
launch my campaign to
make Imperial great again.
It’s gonna be YUUUUG-
GEEE! I said that I would
build a wall around UCL.
When they send over people
they’re not sending their
best. They’re bringing art,
they’re bringing humanities,
they’re not real engineers,
and some, I assume, are
good people. I would build
a great, great wall and
make them pay for it. I’m
the best at building walls,
it’s gonna be beautiful. I saw
a woman with a disability. I
mocked her and laughed at
her until she cried. People
screamed at me, calling me
a horrible person. I said
that I’m a winner and I can
do whatever I want. I told
them to join me. Together,
we would win so much
we’d be tired of winning.
They walked away, unable
to accept so much victory.
For dinner I made a T-bone
steak so well-done the
smoke forced the entire
building to be evacuated. I
ate it, the taste of charcoal
in my mouth as the sign of
\\ I ate my breakfast
with a gun. Don't ask
me how I did it, I just
did \\
\\ You may ask
how I can afford to
live like this. I took
out a small loan of
£10,000 from my
parents. They're
gonna be livid when
they find out \\
success. I washed it down
with a big bottle of Califor-
nia wine. You may ask me,
how can I afford to eat like
this? I took out a small loan
of £10,000 from my parents.
They’re gonna be livid when
they find out.
I then realised that to com-
plete my quest to make my
life great again, I needed a
woman. Shockingly, I don’t
have a girlfriend. I went to
the club and saw a bunch
of 7s, some 6s, some 5s and
there in the centre was a 9.
She was amazing. She was
gonna be my ex-wife. She
looked like the daughter I
would go ape over if I had
children. I went to her and
told her how great I was.
She was gonna share in my
greatness. She told me to
go away and people started
defending her. I thought of
grabbing her by the pussy
but the bouncers threw me
out. Outside, a bunch of
guys beat me up. I blacked
out.
I woke up in the hos-
pital with a great, great
headache. I had so many
bandages on. The nurse
came to me and was like
“Aren’t you that crazy
person who yelled that he
was decolonising his life?”
I said that I was Donald
Trump. She slapped me
and walked off. Day one of
making my life great again
was complete. Tomorrow is
a new adventure. A great
adventure. The best. Every-
one says so. It’s terrific.
