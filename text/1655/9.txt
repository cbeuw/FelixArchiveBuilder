I turned vegan
four months ago
– am I allowed
to preach yet?
Alex Chaudhri talks (not preaches)
about why he decided to ditch animal
products
A
year ago,
after mostly
avoiding meat
for several
months, I
decided to
make the commitment to
being fully vegetarian. My
decision for this was mostly
driven by a concern for
the planet. The Food and
Agriculture Organisation
of the UN estimates that
14.5% of global greenhouse
gas emissions come from
the livestock industry. The
financial implications of
not buying meat were also
extremely satisfying (you can
buy two kilos of dried beans
for a couple of quids and
that turns into a lot of food).
Having said that, becoming
a committed vegetarian
wasn’t so easy — not for the
first couple of months at least.
Formerly, I was someone
who really enjoyed eating
meat. And living with other
meat eaters was not easy,
the smells of cooking would
make my stomach pang.
Borough Market was a no
go. A common experience
amongst recently turned
herbivores is a foreboding
anxiety that you will never

\\ I realised how
much dairy eaters
stink (you smell a
lot worse than you
think!) \\

environmental
destruction and

oppression \\
feel full again; you convince
yourself that there is no food
that will satiate your appetite
like meat could. I replaced
that hole with emetic
quantities of chocolate and
biscuits. A Lidl trip would
be a conveyor belt full of
vegetables chased by a
stack of twelve or fifteen
30p chocolate bars.
But those feelings go pretty
quickly (as if you thought that
saving the planet was going
to be easy?*). Give it a
couple of months. And in all
honesty, after three I found
myself utterly repulsed by the
smell of cooking meat, never
mind the thought of eating a
killed animal.
After not too long, I cut
eating dairy. I didn’t mean
it as any kind of actual com-
mitment — I would never
have used the word vegan,
it felt so loaded, so critical
of everyone else. My thinking
was that cutting dairy would
be easy – I have a lifelong
phobia of wet milk and I
never trusted supermarket
eggs (“free-range” doesn’t
mean much). And seeing as I
cook just about all the food I
eat, I very happily went with-
out dairy. For a few months
at least.
It all fell apart when I went
home during the summer: my
parents had cruelly filled the
fridge with lots and lots of
delicious cheese. And out of
London, the only non-meat
to eat at pubs is mac and
cheese or vegetable lasagne
(which comes with a whole
lot more cheese). Eggs were
an issue, made prominent
by my mum’s insistence that
the “lovely eggs” from her
“lovely chickens” were rea-
sonably ecologically secure
— besides, they were lovely.
I finally resolved that when
I came back down, I’d avoid
dairy. From being vegetar-
ian, this turned out to be quite
easy and very satisfying. My
skin was instantly better, I felt
a lot better in my self. Also,
I realised how much dairy
eaters stink (you smell a lot
worse than you think!). Not
requiring animals in your
food chain is also incredibly
satisfying. There are literally
uncountable reasons why it
is better for the planet to be
vegan, and I could just do
a long list here, but to save
this article from becoming
too preachy I’ll just mention
one thing.
Whilst vegetarianism is a
great way to greatly shrink
your ecological footprint,
you’re still relying on domes-
ticated animals. We’re
currently living in an age
of mass extinction, the total
mass of all the humans on the
Earth is around seven times
that of all the other wild
terrestrial animals together,
and the mass of domesti-
cated animals is twice that
of humans. I strongly feel
that domesticated animals
are very distinct from their
wild counterparts, they have
been humanised — bred to
be useful rather than nec-
essarily healthy or happy
(and there is overwhelming
evidence for emotional intel-
ligence, particularly amongst
the large mammals which are
most “useful” to us). Growing
up in the countryside I was
already aware of the gaunt
misery of dairy cattle, and
in London of the deformed
dogs, inbred to make cute,
perpetually juvenile pets.
Humans and their animals
outweigh the wildlife, with
whom we share the Earth's
surface, by more than twenty
times. And without being too
preachy (I have, haven’t I?),
it was ethically inescapa-
ble that I should turn from
vegetarian to vegan. Of
course I still accept that my
western lifestyle relies on a
great deal of environmental
destruction and human and
animal oppression.
Generally, people were
supportive of my decision,
though my friends outside of
London took a great deal of
the piss (less than I’d expect
though), and my mum insisted
on diagnosing my diet as ort-
horexic — I still haven’t taken
a single vitamin D or B12
though (yeah, fuck the nutri-
tional establishment!).
My grandparents, on the
other hand, were far less
impressed. When I was going
round to theirs for tea, I rang
ahead to notify them of my
“even more difficult dietary
situation” and asked if “that
would be OK?”. My grand-
mother told me that “it would
have to be, wouldn’t it?”. Nat-
urally, I assumed by her tone
that she was joking, but my
mum insisted that she really
wasn’t. At theirs, I ate a sep-
arate plate of dhal and rice
\\ I ate a separate

rice while my
granddad laid into

while my granddad laid into
me, out of principle (or dis-
appointment) I expect. After
that we were all ok though.
At Christmas, I cooked a
separate nut and lentil Wel-
lington, but my family were
all very nice about it and my
sister made the best choco-
late cake (Nigella).
It is quite easy going vegan,
and I’ll say it – go vegan! (Or
at least stop eating meat).
*also, remember not to
be overtly smug or too
self-righteous.
Leave
Trident
alone
Charles Titmuss defends the UK's
renewal of (necessarily) scary nuclear
weapons
T
rident was
announced as the
UK’s new deterrent
back in 1980, and
patrols with the
missile began in
1994. The renewal of trident
was debated in July 2016, to
replace the current submarines
with the newer Dreadnought
Class by 2028. The estimated
cost of the upgraded weapons
system is around £31 billion.
Last week an article about
Trident was published in
felix. It was focused around
the fact that the government
lied to MPs and the general
public ahead of a crucial
vote on whether or not to
renew Trident. This denial
of information was undoubt-
edly outrageous, as it is a
critical aspect of the nation’s
defence as well as a colossal
investment, and the public
has a right to know whether
it is effective or not.
However, at this point, the
article and I diverge, due to
its suggestion that this fail-
ure would and should alter
our opinions as to the util-
ity of the Trident deterrent
as well as several factual
inaccuracies: there was a
single missile as opposed to
many, and an error in the
input data led to the fail-
ure of the targeting. These
are serious technical issues
that should be resolved, but
the article trotted out the
classic tropes of an anti-nu-
clear weapons argument:
this failed launch shows
they don’t work, they’re
not necessary because the
USSR doesn’t exist anymore,
smart weapons don’t work
and that the real threats are
cyber and terrorism, etc.
\\ They are an excellent
example of creating peace
through fear \\
This misunderstanding of
the weapon system and its
purpose in the geopolitical
sphere is fundamental to this
argument. Its assumption is
that nukes are terrifying and
therefore they are terrible
and everyone should get
rid of them. They miss the
point that that is the point of
nukes: they’re fucking terri-
fying. They are so terrifying
that no nation is willing to
risk unleashing them on
another. Frankly, they are an
excellent example of creat-
ing peace through fear, and
ultimately it is a sad indict-
ment on humanity itself.
They are also a proven
technology. The Trident
system employed by the
Royal Navy has undergone
161 successful tests with
fewer than 10 confirmed fail-
ures. These tests have mostly
been carried out by the US,
which uses the same weapon
system as the Royal Navy.
The earliest ballistic missiles
were the V2s, famously used
in World War II to make
life difficult for Londoners.
Smart weapons really are
a thing. Just look at any
modern weapon system and
it contains enough tech to
fly a missile through a small
window. If I’m honest I find
that fact pretty sickening.
The National Security
Strategy Document, pub-
lished in 2010, does rate
terrorism and cybercrime as
the greatest threats to the
UK. However, this can be
simply explained by the fact
that nukes counter the threat
from aggressive nation
states directly whereas
\\ That is the point
of nukes: they're
fucking terrifying.
They are so
terrifying that no
nation is willing to
risk unleashing them
on another \\
cyber and terrorist attacks
are a more complex issue to
counter. They are, by their
very nature, diverse and
unpredictable, and often the
measures that law enforce-
ment say they require to
combat them infringe our
civil liberties to an uncom-
fortable degree, as revealed
by Edward Snowden.
As for the argument that
the USSR is gone and now
everything is fine, please
see North Korea, Russia or
China for an example of an
antagonistic nuclear state.
Russia’s actions in Crimea,
North Korea’s development
of ever more potent nuclear
weapons and China’s island
claims in the South China
Sea demonstrate just how
volatile the international situ-
ation is. Although we do not
face the ideological threat of
the USSR in the same way as
we once did, that does not
mean we no longer require
these weapons for a long
term insurance policy.
Nuclear weapons are an
excellent deterrent, albeit
a horrifying one. They are
used daily as one of the sub-
marines patrols the oceans,
preventing threats from
nation state actors. Trident is
not a fix-all weapons system:
it could and should be made
cheaper, it should be 100%
reliable and it is a horrify-
ing solution to the issue of
war, but, in the main, it does
work.
I do not support the current
US administration’s proposal
to expand the nuclear arse-
nal. A few nukes per nation
is more than enough to scare
the shit out of anyone with
designs on them, and only
an orange shit in a wig could
possibly misunderstand this.
Nuclear proliferation was a
terrifying issue of the Cold
War, culminating in the
Cuban missile crisis. Let us
hope that, ultimately, nuclear
weapons will never be used,
and those in power remain
rational in their approach to
international diplomacy.
