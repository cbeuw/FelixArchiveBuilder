|Anorexia
As Eating Disorder Awareness Week edges closer, one reader shares with us their struggle with
anorexia. Through the haziness they try to recall the ups, the downs and the lessons learned.
I
thought the only way I
could dull my anxiety
was starving it. If I was
dizzy and needed to
concentrate hard on
staying upright, there
was no space left to worry.
Before long I’d reach a
comfortable haze, unable to
carry a thought for more than
a few seconds. The emptiness
inside my stomach made
the tightness in my chest
less noticeable. Neglecting
my ever growing to-do list
didn’t seem so bad if I got a
kick every time I managed
to avoid a meal. Avoiding
any sort of consumption
became my crutch. Not
only had I convinced myself
that restricting my intake of
food would put my physical
symptoms at bay, but I started
believing that I was a much
better version of myself when
I hadn’t eaten. I’m still not
sure of what was happening
at the time, whether I was
actually having fewer panic
attacks on an empty stomach
or if I was so desperate
for something to take them
away that I convinced myself
it was working. I became
obsessed with constructing
a façade where it seemed
everything was okay. I’d smile
and agree to meet for lunch,
while playing my favourite
game of making it seem like
I’d nearly finished my meal,
having hidden most of it or
rearranged it in the plate. I
spent more and more hours
without food, thriving off
of the sense of control and
independence. Soon this
behaviour became second
nature.
When I did eat, it tended to
be fast food. I wasn’t avoid-
ing any particular classes of
food, or counting calories like
I’d done in my first encounter
with anorexia eight years
prior. I knew my habits wer-
en’t normal, but I convinced
myself it was okay, definitely
not an illness or something
I couldn’t manage. Sure, I
didn’t eat as regularly as the
average person, but I was
still eating sometimes, and
don’t all adults get too busy
to eat occasionally? Rapidly,
I started to feel like I wasn’t in
control anymore – the feeling
of accomplishment I got from
ignoring meals became more
and more difficult to attain.
I was conflicted, unable to
decide whether I wanted to
change and get help or if
losing the sense of achieve-
ment that came with avoiding
meals was too much to bear. I
began to lash out at everyone
around me. At the time I
felt too ashamed to put my
actions into words. Nobody
had seemed to notice what I
was doing so it felt impossible
to tell anyone what was hap-
pening. Saying there was a
problem out loud also meant
acknowledging there was one
for sure. I had to abandon
the rhetoric of a ‘spectrum of
normal’ I’d managed to fool
myself into thinking.
Finally, I managed the
courage to get help. Even
in the initial stages of
assessment and therapy, I
wasn’t entirely sure there was
anything wrong with me. I’d
had a more ‘textbook’ eating
disorder in the past, where
thoughts of calories and dress
size dominated everything
I did. It was only when a
dietician told me (rather
dramatically) that I would
eventually starve to death if
I continued along the same
trajectory that it became
impossible to be blasé about
the situation. Eating more
regularly was difficult to start
with, but after a couple of
months I started to get my
strength back. It was hard to
face that a lot of my struggles
had been linked to my weight
and appearance – topics
I hadn’t allowed myself to
consciously think about in
nearly a decade. When I
became aware of gaining
weight steadily, of physically
getting bigger, of the fact
that there was more of me in
the world, I nearly lost all the
progress I made and reverted
to my habits. Gaining weight
became a proxy for commit-
ting to my surroundings and
responsibilities – was I ready
for that? It was only then that
I started to understand my
relationship with food was
very much about self worth.
I doubted whether I was
worthy of eating, worthy of
consuming things and occu-
pying space. Managing to
control something measurable
was an easy way to feel like
I’d achieved something and
was therefore deserving of
my existence.
Now I recognise how
unkind it was to put this much
pressure on myself. I felt like I
\\ The emptiness

\\ It was only
when a dietician

was letting people down; not
achieving enough academ-
ically or not being a good
enough friend. If you are
struggling or feeling inade-
quate, remind yourself that
you owe nothing to nobody.
Your priority should be
yourself and everything else
is secondary. Like everything
else in life, it’s easier said
than done.
SO...... yeah...
You’ll starve to death
if you continue
along the same
trajectory.
Soz.
Omg... I’m so full
I can’t believe I
almost cleared that
massive plate of
meatball pasta
