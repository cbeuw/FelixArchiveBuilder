Society has
an eating
disorder
Emily-Jane Cramphorn discusses our
insidious weight loss culture
S
ociety has an eating
disorder. Sweeping
statement, I know,
but take a second
to look at the
posters next time
you get on the tube. Diets,
cookbooks, meal replacement
shakes, protein bars, detox
teas and pretty much anything
you can think of claiming to
be the answer to your weight
problems. Weight problems
that you probably don’t have.
We are constantly bom-
barded with the idea that we
should be thinner; that tummy
rolls are going to kill us and
that becoming lighter is the
key to health. We spend hours
obsessing over what we should
and shouldn’t eat, counting
calories and reading up on
miracle weight loss regimes.
We waste millions of pounds
of weight loss teas, diet pills
and meal replacement shakes
advertised by beautiful, and
\\ Our entire society is
afflicted with the distorted
relationship with hunger and
food \\
most definitely photoshopped,
women who are being paid a
fortune to say it has made them
thin. We demonise gluten, fat,
sugar and pretty much any-
thing that tastes good. Carbs
are replaced with courgettes
and we use apps to track all
our calories in and out. Food is
categorised as good and bad
and the ultimate goal is to take
up less space, eat fewer calo-
ries and consist of less matter.
We constantly measure and
compare ourselves, we glorify
the idea of restriction and self
control, and tend to be guided
by the notion that less is more.
Everywhere we look, weight
loss is being thrust upon us,
whether or not we actually
need to lose weight.
If society were a person,
undoubtedly it would be
diagnosed with an eating dis-
order: so many of the things
that our society promotes are
behaviours chastised in eating
disorder units and that treat-
ment programs force their
patients to change. It is not
healthy to obsess about food,
to eliminate entire food groups
or to force your body to exist
below its natural weight. Meal
replacement shakes are great
for on the go snacks, to get in
extra nutrients when you exer-
cise heavily or on days when
you don’t have time to cook,
but they should not be used
as an alternative to food. Our
bodies are designed to digest
solid food, thus, surviving of
liquid nutrition can cause an
array of digestive problems,
not to mention fostering an
unhealthy relationship with
food. There is a reason why
eating disorder patients are
pushed to eat solids over
liquid or enteral nutrition.
Likewise, whilst processed
food often contains far too
much sugar, humans have
evolved to utilise carbohy-
drates as their main source of
energy. Thus, cutting carbs is
both unhealthy and unsustain-
able in the long term. It’s called
keto because you go into keto-
sis, a state at which your body
breaks down fat stores, includ-
ing the essential ones, to form
ketones in order to fuel itself.
Whilst this isn’t immediately
harmful, in the long term it can
eventually cause muscle loss,
reduced metabolic rate and
deadly pH changes. What is
more, prolonged ketosis forces
the body into ‘starvation mode’
and will only make you gain
more weight in the long run. It
sounds like an old wives' tale
but I can assure you that it is a
real risk – check out the Min-
nesota starvation experiment.
I could go on to rant about
why detox teas are quite lit-
erally s**t or why diet pills
are stupid but that is not why
I chose to write this article.
The point I want to make is
that people come in different
shapes and sizes, some of us
are heavier than others but
heavier doesn’t mean less
healthy. Many people with an
overweight BMI are perfectly
healthy, whilst others in the
‘normal’ range are damaging
their body by forcing it to be
there. Our bodies have a genet-
ically determined set point
and BMI is simply a measure
of how your height to weight
ratio compares to that of the
rest of the population. BMI is
good for identifying extremes
but is largely an unreliable pre-
dictor of health. Indeed, some
studies have identified that
being slightly overweight can
reduce the risk of disease. Ulti-
mately, if you’re having to go
hungry or obsess over intake
so as to be a certain weight,
the likelihood is that it is not
your optimum weight.
We live in a society where
the numbers that are on the
scales and stitched into our
clothes determine the food
that we eat. We obsess about
food and dieting all of the time
and, by and large, have forgot-
ten how to eat intuitively. They
say one of the key indicators
of eating disorders is skewed
hunger cues and poor percep-
tion of satiety, but honestly,
I think our entire society is
afflicted with the distorted
relationship with hunger and
food. Food is not something
that needs to be earned using
a currency of exercise. Unless
medically advised, we should
not need to use apps and diet
plans to dictate what we eat.
More importantly, we should
not be assigning moral worth
to food or confusing weight
loss with the pursuit of health.
I’m not saying we should
live off McDonald's and choc-
olate cake alone, but eating
McDonald's and chocolate
cake doesn’t mean you have
been bad. Nutrition is all
about moderation, enjoyment
and listening to your body
– things that seem to be con-
demned by the clean eating
and 'fitspo' movements. Sim-
ilarly, I acknowledge that for
some, weight loss is a neces-
sary factor in their pursuit of
health, but heavy and healthy
are not mutually exclusive.
So next time you feel bad
about your tummy tub or for
eating one too many custard
creams, remember that health
comes in all shapes and sizes
and is engendered by a flex-
ible, instinctive and balanced
approach to food.
