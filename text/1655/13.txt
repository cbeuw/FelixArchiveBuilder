T
he television,
with its ability to
repeatedly display
the images of those
who have long since
departed, can act
as an electronic graveyard,
conjuring up spirits from the
past. It is fitting, therefore,
that Christine – the latest film
by Antonio Campos, which
deals with the on-air suicide
of news reporter Christine
Chubbuck – opens with an
image of a TV screen, on
which flickers a ghostly, pale
she’s still a virgin, rapidly
approaching 30 – and
spends her spare time per-
forming existentialist-tinged
puppet shows for sick children
at the hospital (sample
dialogue: “what if you know
someone, but you don’t
really know them?”). All her
energies are devoted into her
work, which involves seeking
out stories involving ‘real
Floridians, but the opportu-
nity for a promotion to a TV
station in Baltimore pushes
Chubbuck into overdrive, as
she seeks ever-more bizarre
methods of getting viewers.
We see her, hunched over film
reels, jarringly lit from under-
neath, wincing in pain at
stomach cramps that will later
turn out to an ovarian cyst; an
operation to remove it would
severely reduce her chances
of conceiving, unless she gets
pregnant in the next couple of
months. To what extent Chub-
buck’s suicide is down to her
mental health problems, and
what part is played by her
less-than-ideal situation, is a
taut skein of a question, which
threads its way through Craig
Silowich’s delicate script.
But while others in the story
have their own problems –
‘gorgeous’ George, the head
anchor, has had drinking
problems; Chubbuck’s mother
Pam self-medicates with mari-
juana – Chubbuck makes the
mistake of seeking solace in
her work. Chubbuck’s interest
is in ‘issue-orientated’ and
‘character-based’ reporting;
in other words, the stories
parade of emotions, with
despair, sardonic humour,
and barely-repressed rage
being communicated in a
single scene. Chubbuck’s dia-
logue is often minimal, usually
pointed, sarcastic retorts, but
Hall manages to get across
a wealth of information in
a simple turn of a head,
or movement of the eyes.
Michael C. Hall is similarly
excellent as the former-jock
George, whose well-meaning
attempts to help Chubbuck
seem to backfire.
There are numerous
moments in the film where
Chubbuck seems to be on
the verge of admitting others
into her life, only for the
door to swing swiftly shut.
Chubbuck’s flat affect and
dark, straight hair is at odds
with the sunny Florida of
the 1970s, a contrast that is
heightened by Joe Anderson’s
cinematography, which revels
in jarring colours. The TV
monitors cast a pale light on
Chubbuck’s face, emphasis-
ing her angularity, while in
other scenes she is bathed in
a ghostly green glow, giving
her a sickly air.
Chubbuck is marked by an
ever-present anxiety about
whether what she’s doing will
get her ahead in her career;
her eyes never quite seem to
focus on other characters,
only snapping to them when
work or promotions are men-
tioned. Early on in Christine,
she asks Jean whether she
seems too sympathetic when
she interviews people; ‘how
can you be too sympathetic?’
she replies. Answers about
human behaviour which
seem obvious to others can
be a mystery to Chubbuck,
something that is heightened
by her day-to-day role as a
‘human interest’ journalist.
In one heart-breaking scene,
she interrupts a couple having
an anniversary dinner: “I
couldn’t help but notice you
back there,” she says, looking
amused, “you both seem to
be very much in love”. At
moments like this, Chubbuck
is desperately trying to under-
stand how the world seems
to work; she is no longer a
news reporter, but the world’s
loneliest anthropologist – she
is trapped behind a screen,
on the outside looking in.

Rebecca Hall astonishes in this biopic
of Christine Chubbuck, a Florida
news reporter who killed herself live
on air, which powerfully explores
the events leading to her death in
an anxiety-ridden tour de force
of ‘real people’. This pits her
directly against station chief
Michael (Tracy Letts), whose
maxim ‘if it bleeds, it leads’ is
reminiscent of Sidney Lumet’s
masterful 1976 black comedy
Network. Like in Christine,
Network ends with the death
of a news-reporter, but while
in Network the responsibility
lies directly at the feet of the
studio, in Christine things are
more complex: it is clear that
Chubbuck is at odds with
both the emerging interest
in exploitative TV, and the
macho culture she encounters
at the office, but this is far
from the only factor contribut-
ing to her demise.
Chubbuck is a tragic figure
in the most classical sense of
the word: we know that she
kills herself, the methods of
her suicide, and that this will
inevitably happen before the
film’s two-hour runtime is over.

| On the
outside
looking in
Chubbuck, in the middle of
interviewing Richard Nixon.
This on-screen image is
divorced from reality, giving
us the unsettling feeling
that we’re looking back
into the past. We soon find
out that Chubbuck is not
in fact interviewing Nixon,
but rather trying to analyse
how she comes across to
the camera, planning on
evaluating every lilt in her
speech and movement of
her head; it is a scene that
immediately communicates
her indomitable work ethic,
her capacity for self-criticism,
and her dreams for a larger
market-share, all of which
play a part in her descent
into depression. This scene
is revisited later in the
film, becoming an anchor
to the departed reporter,
as Chubbuck’s one-sided
dialogue becomes more
pointed: ‘is it paranoia,’ this
spectral Chubbuck asks, ‘if
indeed everyone is coming
after you?’
Is everyone coming
after Christine? Fleeing a
breakdown-inducing Boston,
Chubbuck is forced to live
with her mother in Florida,
working as a local reporter
for a dead-end station. She
has no boyfriend – indeed,
The unavoidable nature of
this ending makes Christine
a near-unbearable watch,
comparable to having a
panic attack in slow motion; a
sinking feeling of impend-
ing doom grips the viewer
from the opening sequence,
and continues long after the
credits have rolled. Small
acts, from both Chubbuck and
others, begin to take on a
deep significance, as the audi-
ence interrogates their effects
on the protagonist.
This hypervigilance is
encouraged by Hall’s perfor-
mance, which can only be
described as masterful; the
fact that she has not received
any major awards this season
is a travesty. Hall imbues
Chubbuck with a fierce
physicality, contorting her
body into spasms of anxiety.
