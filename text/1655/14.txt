Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)
So, what film could prepare you better for the coming
Trump-ocalypse than a two hour action-packed romp
through a post-nuclear holocaust wasteland ruled by a
malevolent dictator with questionable hair and a objection-
able attitude to women? Mad Max: Fury Road shows us
what could happen if Trump continues to get his tiny hands
all over environmental policy. Already he’s resurrected the
Dakota Access pipeline, gagged the National Parks Ser-
vice, and removed the climate change page on the White
House website. Mad Max: Fury Road teaches us that the
way to deal with the incoming environmental crisis is to
pick up a guitar and start shredding.

picks movies for the Trump-era
A Separation (2011)
The rise of Trump has been blamed by some on the exist-
ence of the ‘echo chamber’, where people only surround
themselves with those they agree with. If this is true, it’s
not only a problem of the left: those on the right need
to get in touch with those they might not see eye-to-eye
with. Trump’s recent ‘Muslim ban’ bars citizens from seven
Muslim-majority countries from entering the USA. Among
these countries is Iran, so Trump could do with explor-
ing this country’s cinema, starting with Asghar Farhadi’s
masterful A Separation. Dealing with the divorce of a mid-
dle-class couple, A Separation shows us that – surprise!
– Iranians are no different to the rest of us.

Network (1976)
When trying to find films that predicted Trump, it is better
to eschew tragedy in favour of farce, and things don’t get
much more farcical than in Sidney Lumet’s Network, which
eerily seems to have foreseen the rise of modern TV. Peter
Finch plays Howard Beale, the long-standing anchor of
the UBS Evening News. As a result of declining ratings, he
is going to be fired, but when he has a breakdown on-air,
threatening suicide, his ratings soar. Soon, Beale is regu-
larly sounding off, and as he becomes more deranged the
viewers only increase. Network shows us that it doesn’t
matter if people disagree with what you say, only that they
keep on watching.

Ghost in the
Shell
I
f you wish to dive into
the world of Japanese
animation, you cannot
miss Mamoru Oshii’s
profound 1995
cyberpunk film Ghost
in the Shell. It stands as a
science-fiction classic and
has gone on to inspire other
films such as The Matrix,
Surrogates, and Avatar. But
why am I talking now about
a film released more than
two decades ago? Well,
this March we are to see a
live-action remake of the film,
with Scarlett Johansson as
the lead character. Ahead
of its release, this week
saw cinemas showing the
animated original, so I took
the opportunity to finally see
this classic on the big screen.
Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell
is based on Masamune
Shirow’s manga series of the
same title: set in Japan in the
mid-21st
century, it follows
the undertakings of the coun-
ter-cyberterrorist organisation
‘Section 9’, led by Major
Motoko Kusanagi. In this
world, computer technology
has advanced so far that the
distinction between man and
machine is ultimately blurred
– people in this society are
increasingly cyberised, with
many possessing ‘cyber-
brains’ that allow them to
interface with the various
information networks around
the city. Kusanagi is, herself,
a cyborg, whose only human
part is her brain.
The increasing cyberisation
of society has thrown up a
disturbing problem: there now
exist computer hackers skilled
enough to hack into people’s
brains. This can enable a
hacker to control another’s
actions, and even implant
false memories and experi-
ences. The film’s plot revolves
around the pursuit of such a
hacker, dubbed ‘The Puppet
Master’, in an investigation
led by Section 9 and Major
Kusanagi’s team. The hunt
involves an intricate sequence
of political intrigue, but ulti-
mately leads to a far-reaching
exploration of self-identity
and man’s place in nature.
Shirow claims that the
name ‘Ghost in the Shell’ is
a homage to author Arthur
Koestler’s philosophical work
The Ghost in the Machine,
from which he drew inspira-
tion. And Koestler’s title is
itself taken from the phrase
“ghost in the machine”, which
was ultimately coined by the
philosopher Gilbert Ryle as
Peter Shatwell
a disparaging description of
mind-body dualism. I realise
I may have alienated a few
readers by now, but my point
is that Ghost in the Shell is,
philosophically, very rich,
exploring – among many
other things – the mind-body
(or ghost-shell) problem.
Where exactly is the mind?
Is it the mind that makes us
human, and not machine?
Can that be the case if the
mind can be copied and
placed into a different cyber-
netic body? I like thinking
about this stuff, and such
questions abound whilst
watching Ghost in the Shell.
But even if you don’t par-
ticularly enjoy thinking about
this stuff, luckily the visuals
are gorgeous, and there’s still
a plot to follow. Who is this
mysterious hacker? Are they
even a person? Will they be
caught? Don’t you want to
find out? Well, you’d better
go watch the film. From its
haunting musical score, to
its spellbinding visuals of the
near-future, as well as the
profound existential questions
it raises, Ghost in the Shell
really is a treat to watch. And
hey, it’s even on Netflix –
what have you got to lose?

n a political climate
increasingly described
with the neologism
‘post-factual’, director
Mick Jackson’s latest film
Denial is sharply relevant.
Centering around the libel
case of British Holocaust-
denier David Irving against
American historian Deborah
Lipstadt – a case that was
often referred to as ‘history
on trial’ – Denial make a
convincing case for the
importance of historical truth,
and the dangers of wilfully
misinterpreting facts.
The film opens several years
before the trial, with Irving
(Timothy Spall) upsetting a
Q&A held by Lipstadt (Rachel
Weisz) in promotion of her
book Denying the Holo-
caust. In the book, Lipstadt
accused Irving of deliber-
ately distorting historical
evidence to claim that Hitler
did not murder millions of
Jews and, subsequently,
that the Holocaust was a lie.
This initial scene sets up the
templates the characters will
follow: Irving is irascible and
attention-seeking, goading
his opponents to fall prey
to his rhetorical traps, and
glorifying in the subsequent
uproar; Lipstadt is full of
burning anger at those who
try to belie the human costs
of the Holocaust, but her
fiery temperament means she
comes off worse-for-wear in
the initial confrontation.
We then skip forward a
couple of years, and Irving is
serving libel papers against
Lipstadt for her claims. He
makes the tactical decision
to make the claim in the UK,
where the burden of proof
is on the defendant, forcing
Lipstadt to travel to London
and try and argue against
Irving’s claims. She is assisted
by top-flying solicitor Anthony
Julius (Andrew Scott) and rep-
resented by barrister Richard
Rampton (Tom Wilkinson),
who decide that the best
course of action is for Lipstadt
to stay quiet, depriving Irving
of the oxygen of publicity.
The result, is a script from
playwright David Hare that
relies too heavily on a one-
note culture clash between
American and British cultures.
Weisz’s Lipstadt is the typical
American: all action, she
gets frustrated with her
more subdued colleagues;
The Brits, in contrast, are all
softly-spoken, slightly slippery
and oily (seemingly Andrew
Scott’s favoured role), with Fred Fyles
Weisz works through a dodgy script \\ Laurie Sparham/
Bleecker Street
a penchant for tradition and
claret. As with his theatre
work, Hare’s scriptwriting has
a terminal lack of nuance,
which at points spills into
crass emotional exploitation
(Auschwitz is a site which
deserves more solemnity than
a saccharine Howard Shore
score can offer).
That being said, Denial
remains undeniably enter-
taining, and manages to
successfully explore the
intricacies of the British legal
system – which, as Lipstadt
mentions, is somewhere
between Dickensian and
Kafkaesque – without being
bogged down in the minutiae
of complex details. Weisz
gives Lipstadt a fierce dignity,
making her an extremely
likeable heroine, while Spall
absolutely excels as Irving:
he falls naturally into the
role of gross villain, coming
across like a serpent feasting
on a particularly plump rat.
Despite its tendency to err on
the side of simplicity, Denial
remains a solid courtroom
drama, one that surveys our
labyrinthine legal structure
whilst remaining highly
engaging.
