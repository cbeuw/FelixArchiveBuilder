is definitely entertaining, how
much you personally enjoy
it depends on what you’re
expecting.
Justice League Action is
basically what it says on the
tin, action oriented adven-
tures involving various heroes
teaming up and taking on an
even larger roster of villains.
There is little of the deep,
complex storytelling and
compelling character devel-
opments known from previous
DC animated properties like
S
ince there are a
number of DC
Comics adaptations
on the horizon,
it seems only
fitting that an
animated series be released
to capitalise on its popularity.
While Justice League Action
Young Justice or the affection-
ately named ‘Timmverse’ of
the 90s and early 2000s. If
those are the kind of things
you’re looking for, you’re
going to be disappointed.
On the other hand, JLA
is able to deliver on all the
things it was touted on. The
animation is crisp and fluid
and all the action sequences
are impressive. Though the art
style may seem simplistic at
first glance, in motion, all the
characters appear fine.
That said, a lot of other
adaptations have brilliant
action scenes, but luckily,
this show is able to provide
something more in the form
of humour and character
dynamics. Though Super-
man, Wonder Woman and
Batman take centre stage,
they guest star with sorts of
heroes from DC Comics, from
the headstrong Firestorm to
the foul mouthed Constantine
(whose cleverly written to
be kid-friendly and still as
you’d expect him to be). The
clash of personalities, as the
heroes are thrust into all sorts
of zany situations, is fun. The
featuring the same atmosphere
and music. In general, all the
characters come alive and feel
like they have genuine distinct
personalities.
This isn’t a story driven show,
nor is it a fitting replacement for
the previous series. At the same
time, it never pretends to be any-
thing other than what it is, a fun
show for all-ages where colour-
ful action and character banter
are the name of the game.
cast contains a mix of veteran
and new voice actors, all of
whom give solid performances.
It is well worth hearing Kevin
Conroy as Batman again after
adaptations like the Arkham
video games. One episode is
a fun tribute to the original 90s
Batman series with Conroy,

A
mong other
smaller, less
internationally
important
incidents,
it seems
to me that 2016 will be
remembered primarily as the
year that
the BBC lost the Great
British Bake Off to
Channel 4.
In what is ostensi-
bly just a show about
people making cakes,
you find a lot of what
British culture is all about,
and how the BBC fits into
our society as a whole.
GBBO really was a reality
show not quite like
any other; while the
Big Brothers and X
Factors of the world
set up storylines
around contestants
being built up as
villains and make
the stakes seem
impossibly high,
GBBO settled itself into
just being a lovely show
about having fun baking
and making friends while
you’re at it.
Indeed, this could be seen
just by how the public talked
about the show. Instead of
complaining that certain con-
testants shouldn’t have been
put out when they did, people
tended to agree that while it
was a shame, they didn’t
have their best week so it
was only fair. Big Brother
had Jade Goody’s
racist incident, Bake
Off had BinGate.
The news that the
show would be moving
to Channel 4 from
BBC 1 displayed quite
nicely the difference in
the public perception of
each channel. Upon hearing
that the show had been
moved to the channel
that gave us Naked
Attraction, images
were conjured up in
the public’s minds
of Cake vs. Bread
showdowns, con-
testants twatting
each other with
saucepans, and sex
scandals.
The revelation that
Mel, Sue and Mary would
not go with the show led to
further lamenting about its
\\ GBBO really ]
was a reality show
not quite like any
other \\
Bake sale future before the reveal that
Richard Ayoade would step
in to host and was met with a
collective ‘Hmm.’.
While it certainly will be a
different show with Ayoade, I
think it could show a different
side of the British attitude;
from the quaint loveliness of a
village fete to the repressed,
awkwardness of the rush hour
tube.
