denounced The
Times when
La Traviata was first staged
in London in 1856. Although
it is now the most frequently
staged opera worldwide, La
Traviata’s beginnings were
plagued by stern censorship
and moral outrage. That a
common prostitute should
be portrayed in anything
other than a negative light –
worse, for her to be the star
of the show – was a shocking
statement to make in the
Victorian era.
This was all the more so
because prostitution was very
much rampant in 19th
century
Paris. In 1847, just a few
years before, the renowned
courtesan Marie Duplessis
had died of consumption.
Despite her profession, her
delicate and refined nature
was praised by her many
lovers, among whom were
Franz Lizst and the writer
Alexandre Dumas fils. After
Duplessis’ death, Dumas
wrote a semi-autobiograph-
ical play based on her life,
La Dame aux camélias
(Duplessis wore red and white
camellias to signify her sexual
availability). It was this play
that inspired Verdi to write La
Traviata.
The presence of courtesans
was winked at by Parisian
society, but only as long as
they knew their place – these
‘fallen women’ could never
be elevated above the status
of their sin. Personally, Verdi
also ran afoul of these inflex-
ible societal rules: society
strongly disapproved of his
decade-long cohabitation
with the singer Giuseppe
Strepponi.
With his tragic heroine Vio-
letta, Verdi brought society’s
hypocrisy uncomfortably
into the public eye. Small
wonder that the opera-house
La Fenice insisted that La
Traviata be disguised safely
in the costume of the previous
century. For thirty years, La
Traviata was set anachronis-
tically in the 1700s. But the
audience could probably
tell that it was a "subject for
[their] times” – modernity, in
the form of the fashionable
waltz and polka rhythms, per-
vades the score of the opera.
Waltz rhythms are heard
throughout Act I, as Violetta
throws a grand party for
a crowd of friends and
admirers. The young Alfredo
Germont declares his love;
Violetta refuses him initially,
but gives him a camellia and
tells him to return when it is
faded. In Act II, their happy
life together is dashed by
the appearance of Alfredo’s
father. The older Germont
regretfully asks Violetta
to leave Alfredo because
her reputation is hindering
the respectable marriage
of Alfredo’s sister. Though
torn, Violetta sacrifices her
happiness and writes in a
letter to Alfredo that she is
abandoning him. The two
later meet at a party where
Alfredo publicly denounces
and humiliates Violetta, who
faints from the shock. In the
third act, Violetta’s consump-
tion has caught up to her and
she is dying. Alfredo, having
been told of Violetta’s fidelity
and sacrifice, rushes to make
amends, but it is too late, and
she dies in his arms.
Richard Eyre’s production of
La Traviata is located in the
mid-19th
century, exactly as
Verdi envisioned. As is appro-
priate for a great classic, the
interpretation is literal rather
than avant-garde. This is the
production’s 14th
revival at
the ROH since its premiere
two decades ago in 1994 –
a testament to its enduring
popularity – and yet it is far
from old-fashioned or boring.
This is one of the most beau-
tiful sets I have seen in any
production, conjuring realistic
atmospheres of grandeur or
bleakness without tipping
over into excess (I’m looking
at you, Manon Lescaut).
For an opera, the story of
La Traviata feels surprisingly
authentic, perhaps because it
is inspired by real life rather
than legend. No gypsies
being burnt at stakes here,
no revenge carried over
from generations before, no
supernatural curses dogging
the protagonists as in Il Trova-
tore or The Flying Dutchman.
Verdi’s sensitive render-
ing of his characters has
La Traviata |
An opera that
speaks to the
heart
Claire Chan
Joyce El-Khoury as Violetta Valéry in La Traviata
\\ Tristram Kenton
created a Violetta who is both
startlingly human and heart-
breakingly vulnerable, and
therefore I think the success of
a run of La Traviata hinges on
the soprano playing her. Not
only must she navigate the
challenging arias and their
fiendish coloratura demands,
she must also successfully
embody the youthful beauty
wasting away from consump-
tion. Violetta is marked by
death, and she knows it; this
knowledge fuels her “living
for pleasure” in Act I and
heightens the tragedy of her
parting from Alfredo in Act II,
which is to be final.
The first ever Violetta, the
plump and middle-aged
Salvini-Donatelli, was so
unconvincing that the audi-
ence burst into laughter at
her imminent death in Act III.
Verdi himself recognised the
unique need for a believable
actress, writing that the singer
should have “an elegant
figure, be young and sing
passionately… Even a medi-
ocrity could possess the right
qualities to shine in that opera
and be dreadful in everything
else.”
Fortunately, Joyce El-Khoury
was marvellously believable.
She held my attention from
Act I; her rich and mature
voice was well controlled, her
trills and flourishes perfectly
in tune with the orchestra. Her
true strength, though, was
in bringing across Violetta’s
depth of character. In the
famous “Sempre Libera”
(Free and aimless), El-Khoury
sang with the wild gaiety
of Violetta’s commitment to
pleasure, but also conveyed
the confusion of her slowly
falling for Alfredo. I was
completely sucked into her
heroic self-sacrifice in Act
II’s “Dite alla giovine…”(Tell
your daughter…) against the
unyielding demands of Ger-
mont the elder (sung by Artur
Ruciński’s splendid hoary bar-
itone). Sergey Romanovsky
was occasionally a bit rigid as
Alfredo but his mellow tenor
complemented El-Khoury
excellently in the duets.
Although I am not one who
sheds tears easily, even I had
a lump in my throat during
El-Khoury’s “Addio, del
passato” – Violetta bidding
poetry in La Traviata and its
tale of anguish, of self-sac-
rifice. The ROH’s classic
production and outstand-
ing cast brings it out to the
highest degree. Verdi would
have approved.
La Traviata will return to
the Royal Opera House in
June 2017. Tickets from £11.

Wish List |
A harrowing
portrait of
zero-hours
contracts
I
f someone were to
wander into the snug
stage-room on the
top floor of the Royal
Court Theatre on Friday
evening, if they were
lucky enough to enter at the
right moment, they might
chance upon what appears
to be an impromptu, karaoke
rendition of Meat Loaf’s
I Would Do Anything For
Love. A bemusing sight,
but just a fleeting fantasy
in the harsh reality of a girl
called Tamsin, who tried to
support both herself and her
younger brother through her
taxing, zero-hours contract.
Struggling to make ends
meet, she has taken on a
job at a packing warehouse,
whose almost-Orwellian
motto ‘Work. Enjoy. Improve.’
reeks of irony, leading to it
being mockingly dubbed the
‘fulfilment centre’ by Luke –
Tamsin’s co-worker.
This is the world of Kath-
erine Soper’s Wish List: a
play, beautifully directed by
Matthew Xia, which draws
you into a world where life is
difficult, and bureaucratic red
tape seems to cordon off the
escapes in every direction.
Tamsin’s 16-year-old
younger brother Dean
depends on her due to
his obsessive-compulsive
behaviour, which has ren-
dered him incapable of going
to college or even leaving the
house alone in the daytime.
But this is not how the gov-
ernment seems to view it, and
Dean’s benefits are cut after
he is deemed fit to seek work.
Everything about this play
is lonely: the cast consists of
just four different characters,
and the play is set in a quiet
room with a capacity perhaps
more commonly associated
with classrooms than theatres.
There is no question about
how accurately this reflects
Tamsin’s reality, which seems
to be isolated in every way –
she is cut off by her brother,
by her dire situation, and by
the governmental bureau-
cracy, which fails to see the
name behind the numbers.
And yet, in a strange way,
Wish List seems to shine. The
distance we feel makes us
appreciate the fleeting flashes
of hope and happiness we
witness throughout, making
them all the more flavourful,
such as the moment when
Tamsin receives a tea-light
from Luke, which stands
out all the more. The play
somehow manages to capture
the grim irony of Tamsin’s
situation in a very cute way,
with a surprising number
of laugh out loud moments,
many stemming from the
light-hearted and likeable
character of Luke, performed
perfectly by Shaquille Ali-
Yebuah; it’s a kind of humour
that is hilarious in the terrible
yet beautiful way it captures
Tamsin’s awful situation.
In such an intimate setting
– where the audience are
as much a part of the stage
as the actors – the chal-
lenge facing the cast is much
greater than acting in front of
a larger audience. As Tamsin,
Erin Doherty puts forward a
very strong and emotional
performance, making Tam-
sin’s struggles evident through
devastatingly nuanced words
and expressions. Dean’s
character is illustrated in
a terrifyingly real way: his
fragile mental state, despite
at first seeming very in-your-
face, swiftly and seamlessly
becomes an intrinsic part of
the character, and I credit this
to Joseph Quinn’s unflinching
portrayal. Aleksandar Mikic
also shines in his role as the
Lead – Tamsin’s ostensibly
stiff supervisor whose true
character gradually comes
into the light, revealing him as
a family man who has simply
fallen prey to pressures from
those above him.
S
happi Khorsandi
has lived in
England for 40
years, and in Oh
My Country!: from
Morris Dancing
to Morrissey she explains her
Billy Bragg-inspired brand
of patriotism: “it’s about
places, not races”, she says,
delivering anecdotes about
skinheads in the 80s and
racial abuse nowadays with a
sense of nostalgia. Khorsandi
is adamant about her identity
being defined on her own
terms, and refuses to be put
in a box. She explains her
aversion to her book, Nina is
Not Okay, being nominated
for an award dedicated to
"Writers of Colour" – “I’m not
a crayon!” she says, showing
the audience an open letter
she received in response to
asking herself to be removed
from the long list. Having
been accused of “obscuring
her identity”, she points at her
face, and her book cover, on
which her name is printed.
She’s never had to justify her
Iranian heritage, she says.
Her young children per-
fectly exemplify her dual
culture: she paints a picture
of her sarcastic son watching
Countryfile, snacking on
potted beef, while her dra-
matic three-year-old daughter
calls it “dog food” and goes
back to eating her sheep’s
head. She brings out her
passport onstage, telling the
audience about a conversa-
tion with a twelve-year-old
refugee in Calais who was
so impressed she had a red
one. She reads the front,
and describes it as a “sick
note from the Queen”. She
rolls her eyes at Trump, and
reflects on the absurdity of
the idea of her satirist father,
forced to flee death threats in
Iran 40 years ago, not being
allowed to travel to the US.
Having delivered a speech at
the rally the night before, she
complains about having to
come up with new material on
such short notice.
All her material is delivered
with charm and authentic-
ity. It’s impossible to not be
endeared when she notices
some change by her feet
and moves it off the stage.
“It’s bad luck!” she explains,
and asks the audience not
to tell the British Human-
ist society, of which she is
president. Khorsandi‘s natural
charisma, combined with her
original, politically-tinged
material, add up to a show
that is optimistic, and at times
bittersweet.
Shappi Khorsandi's Oh My
Country! is on at the Soho
Theatre until 4th
February.
Tickets from £13.
