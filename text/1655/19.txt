Most recently the Muslim ban has stirred a backlash from musicians across the globe.
A
s the world
reacts to
Trump’s
Muslim ban,
amidst huge
protests
held across the globe,
condemnation from the music
industry has been rife.
Nicki Minaj, Bette Midler,
and DJ Khaled are three of
the many musicians to take
to twitter to oppose Trump’s
most controversial executive
order so far, while Four Tet
has added songs from the
affected countries to his
playlist (found on Spotify)
in solidarity with the people
suffering as a result of the
order. Carried out in the
interests of National Security,
the order prevents citizens
of seven countries of Muslim
majority (Syria, Iran, Sudan,
Libya, Somalia, Yemen, and
Iraq) from entering the USA
for 90 days. In addition, it has
halted refugee processing for
120 days (permanently from
Syria) and has more than
halved the cap from 110,000
to 50,000 total refugees that
will be accepted in 2017.
Intended to reduce terrorist
activity in the US, it has
widely been hailed as cruel
and illogical.
The new president is no
stranger to opposition from
the music industry. Both his
campaign and neonatal pres-
idency have been dogged
with criticisms from media
personalities and famous
musicians. This began with a
host of artists requesting that
Donald Trump desisted from
using their music at his rallies.
Known for using classic rock
at his campaign events, artists
such as The Rolling Stones,
LGBTQ community for her
performance at a pre-inau-
guration concert for Trump.
She later retweeted a piece
from The Boston Globe,
describing the nominees for
his cabinet as a “who’s who
of homophobia”.
Trump still has some friends
in music, however. Cultural
icons such as Kanye West,
Kid Rock, and Ted Nugent
all came out in his support
during the campaign. With
Kanye famously saying “If I
would have voted, I would
have voted for Trump”.

Twisted Sister, Steven Tyler,
and R.E.M drafted letters to
his campaign office request-
ing that he no longer play
their music. Aerosmith’s law-
yers were keen to negate “the
false impression that [Steven
Tyler] is connected with or
endorses Mr. Trump’s pres-
idential bid”. True to form,
Trump’s campaign continued
to use mostly unauthorised
music at their events whilst
ignoring repeated requests to
stop from copyright holders
and artists alike.
This trend continued through
to his inauguration, with sing-
ers from Céline Dion to Elton
John refusing to sing. Perhaps
this was partly out of fear
of the backlash from fans,
as Andrea Bocelli reported
receiving after initially accept-
ing the gig. Jennifer Holliday,
a Broadway singer, felt com-
Musicians against Trump
A
ny excuse to
visit one of
my favourite
venues in
London is
welcomed
by me, so much more the
better when that excuse is
me donating to an amazing
charity and getting a great,
music-heavy evening in
return.
The Oval Space is small
and intimate, overlooking
an industrial side of the city
which adds to the very unique
vibe that the venue offers.
Alongside this is a great
sound system and an outside
area perfect for tearing away
from the sweaty crowds for
short dance-free breaks. The
crowd there is always an
incredible one to be part of,
even more so this night when
it felt as if a big community
came together over their love
for music, all in the good of
donating to a great cause.
The whole night was run
for free as all proceedings
went to charity, with the DJs
coming in as special guests –
most of them only revealed on
light-shows, and overpriced
cans of cider (the beer sold-
out within a couple hours).
Each set flowed on from the
other flawlessly, sometimes
without me ever even noticing
the change-over. This could
be due very much to the
intensity of the music and how
easily you were absorbed
into it, dancing along with
the crowd to each track
before realising that hours
had passed and you were in
desperate need of some fresh
air.
This was a perfect example
of a charity knowing its crowd
and appealing to them in a
way that not only offers them
an amazing day of music,
fun and dancing, but raises
awareness of the illness to the
age group most affected, and
letting them help out in a way
that they love.

This night was hosted as a
fundraiser for Mind, a charity
aimed at providing support
to those suffering from mental
health problems. This involves
raising awareness, campaign-
ing to improve the services
available, and helping pro-
mote a better understanding
of this serious set of illnesses
that affect around 25% of
young adults every year.
The greatness of their
fundraiser doesn’t stop there
though, as the music blasting
through the venue when
you enter the heavy double
doors is eager to prove. A
huge line-up with the likes
of Maribou State, George
Fitzgerald, and Midland led
to a day-long music event
with amazing beats, drops,
