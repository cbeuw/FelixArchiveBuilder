A cute little pancake house serving delicious, homemade
pancakes at the back of a bustling food market.

The king of fried chicken waffles hides in the busy Maltby
Street Market, open during the weekends.
4 | Oli Baba’s
Prepare for a heart attack as you munch on these crispy fried
halloumi chips from Oli Baba at the new KERB Camden!
5 | Said London
All hot drinks at this Italian Chocolate café in SoHo are served
in a cup dipped in MOLTEN CHOCOLATE..
6 | Ozone Coffee Roasters
Aside from their amazing coffee roasted in the basement,
Ozone serves the best eggs benedict in London – the kind with
a deep fried bubble ‘n’ squeak.
7 | Bob’s Lobster
A toasted, buttered brioche studded full with chunks of fresh
lobster meat? Hunt Bob’s Lobster down at Street Feast Dalston
Yard.
8 | Oysters at Borough Market
Nothing beats looking down at a plate of freshly shucked
oysters for less than a meal at the QTR.
9 | Da Mario
The annual tutorial group lunch at Da Mario is worth looking
forward to, especially when your tutor pays.
10 | Brown and Rosie
The moment of excitement when you cut open a poached egg
to find a bright orange river of #yolkporn.
