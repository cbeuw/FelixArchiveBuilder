s a Muslim, I was inevitably outraged by Trump’s
#MuslimBan. As a British national, I was equally
outraged by our government’s complicity with it. For
a Prime Minister who claims to lead a country that
prides itself on upholding the values of “individual
liberty” and “mutual respect for and tolerance of
those with different faiths and beliefs”, May’s silence is truly an
insult to the millions of Britons who live by these values every day.
Moreover, her condonation of Trump’s racism and Islamophobia is
a gesture of utter disregard for the three million Muslims living in
the UK. For the Muslims who work hard, every single day, to make
Britain what it is. Our so-called prime minister is telling them that
she does not give a single damn.

office to ensure that all immigrants, many of whom are Muslim,

Thoughts on the #MuslimBan protests
D
uring Donald Trump’s
campaign, we were often
told that his misogynistic,
fascist and bigoted
comments were simply empty
words, that he was simply
monopolising a popular vote and when
in office, diplomacy would come. A week
in, Trump signed a flurry of executive
orders, authorising the construction of
a wall, allowing federal agencies to
stop Obamacare, giving border agents
more freedom to detain immigrants and
banning nationals from seven countries
from entering – even if they held a green
card.
To ignore the parallels between today
and the 1930s is to trivialise the years
of persecution faced by the Jewish com-
munity and other minorities. Throughout
President Trump’s campaign, he reiter-
ated again and again how he would put
in place a ‘Muslim ban’ and spoke about
a Muslim registry. Apologists can call it
by any name, but the sentiment behind
it is clear. The Holocaust is a blot on our
collective global history and it serves as a
reminder that human beings are capable
of such overwhelming horrors, and that
some of the fault is borne by those who
stand by and do nothing.
Today, we see the repercussions around
the world of the dangerous alt-right
A
s an American
Muslim I had to go to
the march because
Trump's policy could
have prevented my
very existence: my
parents immigrated to the US from
the Middle East. It was humbling to
see so many people at the protest
– especially the number of IC
students, as we're generally known
for being politically apathetic.
Trump's policies do not reflect
the America that I grew up in.
My sister and I were two of three
Muslims at my school. Instead of
casting us aside they embraced us
Mazen El-Turk (ISoc VP student affairs) believes we must remain
united to avoid repeating the horrors of the past
Zayd Alhaddad recalls the America he knows and loves and urges
that we fight for what we believe in
rhetoric of division and ‘other’-ness.
From the Quebec shooting to the
Islamophobic attacks being wit-
nessed in some of London’s biggest
universities, Trump’s ‘Muslim ban’
continues to promise a marginal-
ised community even more hate
and distrust. At a time when extrem-
ist ideologies thrive on division, we
need to stand together stronger
in the face of hatred and division
and stand up against the fascist
ban. We have a duty today to let
the Trump administration know in
no uncertain terms that fascism
under the guise of security will not
be tolerated by us. Together, we
stand stronger against all forms of
extremism, and in the face of open
hostility, we need to remain human,
tolerant, and welcoming.
with open arms. During Ramadan fast-
ing the school let us play Monopoly with
the teachers during our breaks instead of
insisting we go and run outside. They let
my mum come in and decorate the school
to celebrate the month, and they put up
the decorations every year even after we
left. They even insisted we took Eid off
so we could spend the holiday with our
family. After the 9/11 tragedies and the
rise of Islamophobia the school invited
my mother to come and speak to the
students about what Islam truly means.
We were never left to feel like outsiders,
and it wasn't like everybody there was
an immigrant; about 80% of the school
was white. This is the America that I grew
up to love and always will. The America
that the Founding Fathers stood up for
(with what they wrote on the constitution
at least), the America that was created
as a safe haven for all peoples to seek
refuge from religious persecution, which
is exactly what the new policy embodies:
it is a flagrant constitutional violation as it
targets a specific religious group.
It is a shame that the POTUS is who he
is, but if we keep making our voices heard
then hopefully we can stop the hatred
before too much damage has been done.
adopt “British values”, is not only going against these very values herself,
but acting to further marginalise a community that she insists should inte-
grate more. The situation would be laughable if it weren’t so destructive.
However, it would be unfair to overlook the abundance of good that has come
from this situation. The past week has seen the British people come out in their
thousands, at short notice, to stand up against this ban. People of all religions
and beliefs, ethnicities and backgrounds stood side by side in solidarity with
their Muslim brothers and sisters in humanity. This week, the British public let
the Muslim community know, that we are an integral part of society. And what
a beautiful moment that was.
So yes, as a Muslim I was outraged by Trump’s #MuslimBan and May’s lack
of concern about it. However, the past few days have proven that you don’t
have to be Muslim to be outraged. You’ve only got to be human to realise that
oppression is wrong. To stand up against injustice.
And whilst we can sometimes feel engulfed by the darkness brought about
by those in power, we will always have hope in the light we, the people, bring
to one another. For as Einstein once said, “darkness is in reality the absence
of light”.
You're
putting me
off my food
Tessa Davey explains why 'normal'
eating habits are a privilege not
afforded to fat people
I
have a complicated
relationship with food.
I think every fat person
does. That isn’t to say I
don’t also think that every
woman or man who is
impacted by the pressure of
beauty standards also does –
I do – but for a fat person it is
subtly different. Being fat is the
reason that we are perceived
as greedy, lazy, stupid. Fat is
the reason that we are told
that we are not attractive, not
desirable, not good enough.
And food is predominantly the
thing that causes that. Food
is something that we need to
consume, several times a day,
but it is also something that is
heavilyassociatedwithshame.
The way that society
interacts with me, a fat
person moving through the
world, greatly affects my
relationship with food. If
I, never having interacted

with a foodstuff in public,
had a totally healthy and
normal relationship with
food (to banish the rhetoric
that all fat people are fat
because they’re greedy
and only eat fried food with
cheese), my eating would
become disordered the
second I stepped out the
door, simply through the
way that people respond
to me. As a fat person, this
forced disordered eating
is something that you have
to tackle and struggle with
every day of your life.
As a fat person, there are
rules that you must follow.
You must never be seen to
be enjoying food (“Oh, well
I can see why she’s fat, she
loves her food, that one”).
You must never eat anything
unhealthy (“Are you sure
you need to be eating that?
No wonder you’re fat”), but
also never anything healthy
(“A salad, great choice! Are
you trying to lose weight?”).
You must never eat in transit
(“You’re so disgusting, can’t
you wait until you get home
like everyone else?”) or men-
tion hunger (“I bet you’re
hungry. Can’t you go a few
hours without eating?”),
but you must also eat when
others do (“If I’m hungry
you definitely must be! Are
you trying to lose weight?”).
These are rules that all fat
people know implicitly, rules
that would never occur to
someone thin, rules which
are contradictory and that
you cannot obey no matter
how hard you try. There
are further rules regarding
the way you must dress and
exercise in public, but those
are a story for a different
time.
These rules are self-im-
posed, you might say.
No one is forcing you to
follow these rules, but your
self-hatred and deep lack of
self-esteem. But this isn’t true.
These rules are enforced
by people on the street, by
friends, by family. They’re
enforced by vicious glances,
by snide comments, by jokes
and by concern. They mean
that every interaction with
food is carefully calculated
to be invisible, to minimise
the chances that someone
might notice you eating and
pass judgement. To not care
and eat what you want is to
make a political statement
that requires huge energy
to maintain. It is not weak to
care, to suffer and to over-
complicate your life because
you can’t take a joke from
your friends or brush off
a comment from a drunk
stranger in McDonald’s at
4am on a Sunday. These
interactions create a strong
negative association with

food, invoking feelings of
panic and discomfort much
like those that society is
hugely sympathetic towards
in ‘real’ eating disorder
sufferers.
There is a rise in the diag-
nosis of illnesses such as
binge-eating disorder and
food addiction which give
some credence to the difficult
and out-of-control nature of
eating for some overweight
people. But these disorders
don’t fit the majority of us.
There is no diagnosis to tout
for people who would have
a 'normal' relationship with
food were it not for their
eating habits being called
into question constantly.
I love food. That is, I love
good food. I love the aes-
thetic and textures and
flavour combinations that
come with (what I think is)
good food; I care less for
the bland beige varieties,
although that isn’t to del-
egitimise enjoying them if
you do. I love that food can
provide comfort through
associated memories and
nostalgia, and I love that
it is something that brings
people together. Seeking out
new cuisines, tasting new fla-
vours, and cooking are some
of my primary hobbies, but
I am always on edge doing
them, ready to deflect com-
ments or defend myself. The
enjoyment I can take from
food is always moderated
by involuntary considera-
tions of whether I deserve
to eat it or what people
around me will think if I do.
This isn’t to minimise the
struggle that I know that
so many of my thin or aver-
agely sized friends face
whenever they make a deci-
sion regarding food; I know
that because of the pressure
to remain thin in order to be
successful, most, if not all
women and men will often
grapple with the choice
between that ‘clean’ probi-
otic falafel salad (shout out
to the stand at the Farmer’s
Market – I think that the pro-
biotic benefits of the pickles
are probably cancelled out
when I eat it with Diet Coke,
but it’s still delicious) and
that ‘dirty’ burger. But their
struggle is purely internal.
To be able to eat in front
of someone without them
making assumptions about
your lifestyle, and more
subtly and insidiously, your
intelligence, is a privilege,
and it is one that you do not
have if you are fat: what we
do on a daily basis to survive
is shameful. I am absolutely
a foodie, but unfortunately,
I am usually one behind
closed doors.
