All hail the sublime starch, the chieftan of cuisine, the triumphant tuber | the potato
As it’s the food edition, we thought we’d focus on the fanciest, most elegant ingredient that most of
us will ever have grace our plates: the potato. We present to you five excellent ways to prepare
this sublime ingredient, as well as a comprehensive breakdown of why it is notably superior to all
other tubers.
Stuffed potatoes
Ingredients:
4 baking potatoes
Bacon
Shredded cheese
2 eggs
1 bell pepper
Black pepper
Salt
1 tsp olive oil
Let the potatoes boil for
20-25 minutes in salty water.
Before taking them out, check
if they are cooked through.
Insert a fork – it should easily
go the whole way through.
There is a fine equilibrium: if
they are too HARD, you won’t
be able too use them, but if
they are too soft, they are
useless.
After they are boiled, cut
them into halves. I prefer to
cut them in two cups, but I
think it’s easier, at least at
the beginning, to cut them
lengthways. Use a spoon to
scoop out the inside of the
potato into a bowl. Be careful
not to take all of it out – you
still should have 1 cm or so on
the margins. Yes, this is why
you need big potatoes! Also,
be careful not to smash them
into pieces – it happens even
to the best of us.
Add some salt and pepper
to the bowl along with the
potatoes. Truth be said, there
are so many ways to stuff
them that I can’t choose just
one!
Method 1: mix the insides
of the potatoes with the finely
chopped bacon, pepper and
onions. Fill the potato jackets
with mixture. Drizzle a bit
of olive oil on top, and cook
everything in the preheated
oven (200°C) for 10 minutes.
Beat the eggs in a bowl and
add the cheese. Carefully,
pour this mixture into the
potatoes and let them cook
for 10 more minutes.
Method 2: add the finely

Rosemary potatoes
Ingredients:
8-10 medium potatoes
1-2 tsp Olive oil
Butter
Rosemary
Salt
This is probably the easiest
way to cook potatoes. First,
preheat the oven at 175.
Peel and chop the potatoes
into smallish pieces. After
arranging them on a tray,
pour some olive oil – not too
much. Sprinkle with chopped
rosemary and a bit of salt.
In my opinion, those are the
only things you need to add,
but you can experiment with
pepper and chilli or God
knows what other condiments
you fancy.
Let the potatoes cook inside
the oven for 15-25 minutes –
you should check them from
time to time after 15 minutes
to make sure they don’t burn!
Mashed potato
Ingredients:
400g small potatoes
1 medium squash
200g evaporated milk
200g butter
Salt
Fresh parsley leaves
Well, I know I said that this
is going to be a recipe about
mashed potatoes, but mashed
potatoes are b-o-r-i-n-g with-
out some great gravy and no
one has time to make great
gravy whenever they cook
mashed potatoes. I always
choose to mix the potatoes
with some squash for extra
tastiness but if you don’t like
it, you can just get rid of it
and still follow the steps.
Boil the (peeled) pota-
toes until they are soft. Peel
and chop the squash. In a
separate pot, boil the squash
cubes. When they are soft,
take the potatoes and the
squash and mash them. Now,
I know that you are a student
and you might not have the
right instrument, but you can
easily use a fork. And a bit of
brute force.
Add the butter and the milk
to the mixture until it softens.
You know, the more the
merrier, so you should add
as much as you can – just be
careful not to make a soup
instead of mashed potatoes.
To finish, use your already
well developed skills at salting
food. For extra deliciousness,
sprinkle some finely chopped
parsley leaves on top.
Potato stew
Ingredients
3 medium potatoes
2-3 big carrots
1 parsnip
250g green peas
1 pear
1 beef stock cube
Pepper
Salt
Cumin
Well, honestly, this one is a
bit of cheating when it comes
to potatoes, but it’s still a
great way of serving Eastern
Europe’s favourite food – and
I can say that without being
racist or xenophobic as I
come from there.
The only thing you need for
this one is a) a pot that can be
used in the oven b) a bit more
time – so, don’t try this if you
are starving c) either luck to
not start a fire when leaving
the oven unattended (which I
obviously don’t recommend,
but hey, we are all humans
and hence, we make mistakes
– or some power to study in
Potato salad
Ingredients:
6-7 medium sized potatoes
2-3 Spring onions
3 eggs
bacon bits
parsley leaves
4-5 medium basil leaves
salt
pepper
Hard-boil the eggs and the
potatoes. Peel the eggs, and
dice into medium cubes along
with the potatoes. Chop the
spring onions, the parsley and
basil leaves. Mix everything
in a reasonably sized bowl.
Add the bacon bits and salt
and pepper to taste.
Congratulations! Now you
have a nice lunch you can
either take to school or enjoy
in the silence of your room.
If you are an animal (which
you probably are, unless you
are a plant or an enormous
bacterium), you might want
to add some mayonnaise – I
don’t, as I’m not a savage.

Where to start? How
many foodstuffs can
compare to the tuber
that brought a whole
nation to its knees –
and I’m not talking about the
Irish potato famine, but rather
the introduction of potatoes
to haute cuisine. People had
been searching for a starch
that was affordable yet
amazing, could be roasted
as easily as boiled, and in all
preparations had the same
delicious taste – the potato
had it all.
Indeed, being first cultivated
in Peru, it was this that the
Spanish conquistadors
searched for – not El Dorado,
but El Potato (city of potato).
Jealously hoarded by their
Incan growers, a fierce battle
would rage culminating in
the genocide of an entire
race just for the acquisition
of a tuber, an event never
duplicated until the great
Jerusalem artichoke battles of
the mid 1700’s #altfacts.
Such is the way of the world
– we were fortunate that
the Spanish throne spread
the potato far and wide,
landing on British shores in
the 1500’s and it has thrived
here ever since. But why is it
so popular?
Compared to their orange
cousins the sweet potato, it is
less saccharine – but this is
truly an advantage, for it ena-
bles it to pair excellently with
meat, and shun marshmallows
entirely. Yams, the hairy,
wrinkled uncles to our divine
tuber are simply too repulsive
when poorly cooked, and
though their nutty flavour is
admirable, they can be easily
set aside when compared to a
fluffy, golden roastie.
the kitchen and tend to the
oven.
First, peel what must be
peeled, wash what must
be washed and then chop
everything in equal sizes –
now, you’ll be thinking: am I
supposed to cut everything in
the same size and shape as
the peas? Ha. Ha. You are my
guest, if you want, but I think
that you know what I meant
and I am not even bothering
to further explain. You are
a smart Imperial student,
riiiight?
Put everything in the pot,
add one or two cups of water,
so everything is covered a
bit. Spice it up. Let cook in
the oven for one hour (more
or less, depending on how
big you cut everything and
how fresh the veggies are),
while you are studying those
integrals and don’t leave the
oven unattended. I mean, you
can, but if you do that and the
fire alarm starts, karma will
strike back in the exams.
Obviously, when ready,
serve with meat!

chopped bacon, pepper,
onion (and some extra
veggie, because now you
have plenty of space inside;
I recommend: slices of toma-
toes and diced carrot) Pour
some olive oil on the top. Put
in the oven for ten minutes.
Add the beaten eggs mixed
with shredded cheese before
letting them cook for extra 10
minutes.
Method 3: use your imagi-
nation! When I like to feel a
bit more sophisticated, I fill
them with unexpected things.
Melon and crispy bacon
are a nice combination, or
spinach and cheese. Cook the
spinach before and mix with
a soft cheese like Feta cheese
and then stuff the potatoes
with it; sprinkle some extra
mozzarella on top of it before
baking. Or pears soaked in
rum and a good old cheese.
Really, the possibilities are
infinite! The only limit is your
imagination.
P.S. if you don’t want to
throw away the inside of the
potatoes but really don’t have
space for them anymore, you
can just mix them with butter
and make them into small
balls that can be cooked in
the oven for 15 minutes. If
you really like cheese – I
mean, who doesn’t? – you
can stuff cheese in the middle
of them.
