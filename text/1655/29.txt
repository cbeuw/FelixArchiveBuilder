CANCER
VIRGO
This week your
schedule’s free and
you decide to catch up
on all your work . . .
Just as soon as you’ve
binge watched all the
latest Netflix series.
LEO
PISCES
AQUARIUS
SAGITTARIUS
SCORPIO
LIBRA
GEMINI
TAURUS
ARIES
This week you go to
a protest and really
enjoy yourself. You
decide to give up
on your degree and
become a civil rights
activist.
This week you
take felix a bit too
literally and decide
to actually try get
high on food. You
put a burger through
a grinder and try
snorting it. THE PAIN!
THE UNIMAGINABLE
PAIN!
This week it’s
Groundhog Day and
you’re the Imperial
Groundhog. You see
your shadow. Six more
weeks of coursework
it is.
This week you tweet
some dodgy stats with
a conservative bias,
and have your career
ruined.
This week your future
sight has abandoned
you. Your third eye has
gone blind and you’re
forced to make shit up.
Wait.
This week’s felix’s double
spread on potatoes
convinces you to give
the library caf’s jacket
potato a shot. THEY
LIED TO YOU! IRISH
PROPAGANDA!
This week you were
at the heart of an
international internet
conspiracy. Do you
even exist? #introspect
This week you are
Donald Trump – as
you are on your visit
to the UK, you are
tricked into getting
Iranian citizenship and
are not allowed back
into the US.
This week you
decide to venture out
and meet some new
people. You quickly
realise you’ve already
met everyone already
and they all suck. Fuck
you world.
This week you’ve had
so much sugar you black
out during a 5pm lecture
and taken to hospital. You
wake up missing a leg.
You really should have cut
down on dem redbulls.
Diabetes is not fun.
This week you decide
to try something other
than curly fries from
568. It tastes like
shit and you have
indigestion the next
day. At least you know
why everyone sticks to
curly fries.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I’m writing to you because I’m in desperate need of love
advice.
There’s this girl in the States that I really like. We met on
tumblr. I made this Ryan Gosling cereal GIF, she reposted it
–long story short it was a digital love explosion.
We’ve been talking for several months now, mostly on
tumblr, mainly via Ryan Gosling exchanges and, as expected,
we’ve developed quite a connection.
We were talking about travelling together to Iran, where we
could crash at my family home (I have dual citizenship, Brit-
ish-Iranian), but since the Muslim Ban she’s scared to leave
the States in case Trump goes mental and starts banning
everyone who’s ever been outside the country.
What should I do?
Yours,
VelociraptorJesus999
Dear... uhm... Jesus?
I feel for ya. Nothing says love quite like a
passionate exchange of gifs of hunks being
forcefed wheat.
I know that in the light of this most recent
adversity you might feel inclined to give up.
BUT DON’T.
I honestly think you have a great opportunity
in your hands. You just need the guts to follow
my instructions.
First, you need to declare your unconditional
love for your American friend. You know which
Ryan Gosling GIF to use. If she’s the girl I think
she is, she’ll reciprocate your crazy stupid love
and she’ll be willing to do anything you ask of
her.
HOROSCOPES
Once you have her in this position, suggest the
Iran trip again, which she’ll obviously agree
to. Fastforward a couple months and you’re in
Iran. Ask her to marry you. I expect she’ll say
yes.
Now all you have to do, is stage a mugging,
during which her passport gets stolen. By that
point there probably won’t even be an Amer-
ican embassy in Iran so you’ve basically won
the girl and trapped her in a foreign country
with you as her sole companionship.
Fullproof.
You’re welcome.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
