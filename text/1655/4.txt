whatever their comments, they
will be held responsible for
their remarks given their posi-
tion of authority and trust.
“We demand that Dr. Adam
Perkins immediately apologis-
es sincerely to the Somali com-
munity at King’s for which he
has caused immense distress,
and that he apologises for his
offensive remarks about So-
malis”
Since then, they have ap-
proached the KCLSU and
have written an open letter
to the Principle. However per-
haps they should be asking for
more than just an apology.
Searching for Open Differ-
ential Psychology the, a rudi-
mentary open access journal,
brings up a total of 31 papers
published since its creation in
2014. Moreover the paper
from which the graph has been
lifted is published by Emil O.
W. Kirkegaard, who also hap-
pens to be the journal’s editor
and author of almost half of
the journal’s papers.
Not only that, but Kirkegaard
is a self-proclaimed “Polymath
scientist, maybe”. As he dis-
closes in his personal website
he boasts “an irrelevant de-
gree that allowed me [sic] to
live off a student grant.”
Kirkegaard also has an en-

UK bound to leave Euratom
Scientists slightly miffed

term concerns such as UK
participation in ITER. However,
it is likely this will not be a
priority for Brexit negotiators,
as their departments are
already overwhelmed and
understaffed.
In a completely different
direction, leaving Euratom
would also slow down
considerably the Hinkley
Point C nuclear power plant
project, as well as make the
operation of all current plants
more difficult. According to
the Guardian “Euratom also
provides safety inspections
for all civilian nuclear facilities
in the UK, including Hinkley
Point B, Sizewell and Torness
in Scotland. It is the legal
owner of all nuclear material,
and is the legal purchaser,
certifier and guarantor of
any nuclear materials and
technologies that the UK
purchases. This includes our
nuclear trade with the United
States.” Taking back control
apparently includes taking
responsibility for nuclear
waste. Surely having won the
most toxic campaign in recent
history and insisting that the
country ‘moves on’ makes the
Brexiters experts in the subject
of toxic waste disposal.
I
n a slightly surprising
move, the UK government
announced last Friday
that Brexit meant leaving
Euratom. This comes after
Theresa May said Britain
would: “welcome agreement
to continue to collaborate with
our European partners on
major science, research, and
technology initiatives” in her
Lancaster House speech last
month.
In an explicatory note
attached to the Article 50
bill, currently being debated
in parliament, the Minister
for Brexit David Davis
announced that “leaving
the EU” included Euratom,
which shares the institutions
of the EU, but has a distinct
legal existence. Euratom is a
European organization aimed
at fostering fundamental and
applied research in the domain
of nuclear energy. Its flagship
projects are currently ITER,
an international experimental
tokamak currently under
construction in Southern
France, and JET. JET, the Joint
European Torus, is particularly
important for the UK, as it is
based in Culham, Oxfordshire.
It is the centrepiece of Britain’s
Culham Centre For Fusion
Energy(CCFE),andiscurrently
the world’s largest tokamak by
inner volume. JET was recently
upgraded to include the same
materials that will ultimately
be incorporated in ITER, to
serve as a test bench. Around
350 scientists from Europe
participate in experiments at
JET each year. None of them
or anyone in the staff at the
Centre for Fusion Energy was
warned in advance by the
government, which suggests
the decision to leave Euratom
was a last-minute addendum to
the Brexit bill. This impression
was further reinforced when
MPs from Oxfordshire also
complained they had not been
given advance notice.
JET is currently funded by
the European Commission
(which administrates Euratom
as well as the EU) to the tune
of 283 € million for the 2014-
2018 period, or very slightly
less than half of Euratom’s
budget for the period. This is
an area of EU spending where
the UK receives substantially
more than it gives. The indirect
impact is even greater: JET is a
significant selling point for the
CCFE and Oxford University,
who have developed a whole
array of skills related to the
tokamak, developing them
into worldwide leaders of
fusion research. Among the
features pioneered by/unique
to JET are the concept of the
diverter –a designated area
where the plasma escapes the
magnetic confinement field–
and the fact that it is the only
tokamak equipped to handle
tritium. These two innovations
of JET have had visible
influences on the whole centre:
several members of staff are
now specialized in diverter
design and performance, and
CCFE boasts the world’s most
efficient tritium repurposing
facility. These would be in
jeopardy if the UK failed
to reach an understanding
regarding JET’s funding after
2018.
The UK could seek associate
membership of Euratom (a
status currently enjoyed by
Switzerland), which would

King’s lecturer sparks racism row
Racist pseudoscientific tweets cause KCLSU complaint
Lef Apostolakis
shared hundreds if not thou-
sands of times. His tweet de-
fending Trump’s Muslim Ban
has been shared 1300 times
and liked almost 2000 times.
After aproaching KCL for
comment, a spokesperson told
felix that “King’s is aware of
recent posts on social media
by Dr Adam Perkins which
have offended some members
of our community. We value
and uphold the principle of ac-
ademic freedom, however we
are equally committed to wel-
coming a diverse and inclusive
staff and student population.
The Executive Dean of Insti-
tute of Psychiatry, Psychology
& Neuroscience has spoken
to Dr Perkins who has apolo-
gised wholeheartedly for any
offence caused.”
It is unclear where Perkin’s
apology can be found; cer-
tainly not on twitter.
As of yet we have not re-
ceived a reply from Perkins.
K
CL’s feminist inter-
sectional society
has condemned a
lecturer at King’s
College London
after he released
a series of tweets which were
described as “racist and in-
credibly insulting remarks di-
rected at the Somali commu-
nity”.
Dr. Adam Perkins, a lecturer
in the Neurobiology of Person-
ality took to Twitter last week
to share his thoughts on immi-
gration. In one tweet Perkins
shares, “Danish data suggest-
ing that welfare benefits taste
sweeter to some cultures than
others” with a screenshot of a
table of a unrelated statistic
from danmarksstatistik.dk. The
table in fact shows a popula-
tion breakdown of unemploy-
ment.
In another tweet he defends
Trump’s Muslim Ban saying it
“makes sense in human cap-
ital terms: people from the
banned nations tend to be
over-represented in crime and
unemployement [sic] stats”. His
tweet includes a screenshot
from what appears to be a sci-
entific paper from Open Dif-
ferential Psychology. Though
the screenshot aims at giving
the tweet scientific credibility,
once again there is no proper
referencing.
Since the tweets were pub-
lished the intersectional femi-
nist society have asked for an
apology.
“Academics must understand
that they are utterly responsi-
ble to [sic] whatever they post
on their social media channels
just as they are for the words
they say in a classroom, and
such reckless tweeting, clearly
made by this lecturer is a prime
example that some may be un-
aware, or indeed neglect their
duties of responsibility when
expressing one’s views
“[We] would appreciate that
ALL lecturers understood that
pseudoscience, accusing him
of conducting racist and pae-
dophilia-apologist pseudosci-
ence.
Besides the questions these
recent tweets raise about the
scientific credibility of Dr. Per-
kins, his political agenda, and
his suitability to teach young
people at one of the country’s
leading universities, they also
raise concerns on the rest of
his social media activity.
His activity is sprinkled with
many uncited graphs and fig-
ures. But due to their conceal-
ment in a flurry of unrelated
material ranging from BBC
News posts to Nirvana video
clips, and posts from reputa-
ble scientific sources such as
Nature and Springer, it is hard
to pick out the pseudoscience
that would otherwise damage
his scientific authority.

followers on twitter, with many

Zero tolerance policy gets scrapped
L
ast Tuesday,
during Union
Council, Student
Deputy President
of Education, Luke
McCrone announced
a repeal to the university’s
zero-tolerance late submission
policy.
According to McCrone’s
report given at the meeting,
the zero tolerance policy will
be replaced and replaced
by a new policy, allowing
assignments to be late, but for
each day of delay the grade
will be reduced by ten percent
until the grade is below the
passing level where it will be
marked as a failing grade.
“Overall we have achieved
an end of the zero-tolerance
policy and a more forgiving
deadline for out students.”
Said McCrone, in his report
for Tuesday, January 24.
The movement to repeal
the zero-tolerance policy
started last year following
the release of the results from
the 2015 National Student
Survey. Following the results,
the Union discussed a possible
change with Imperial’s Quality
Assurance and Enhancement
Committee (QAEC). At the
first discussion the QAEC was
skeptical of any sort of change,
according to the report.
Following that initial
discussion, two surveys were
conducted regarding the late
submission policy. The first
one conflicted with views of
reduction, the decision to grant
a failing grade after falling
below the passing quota
was negotiated in a meeting
between the QAEC and
college members. The parties
agreed that an unlimited
reduction system would allow
students to “game” the system
and provide less incentive
to submit work on time. They
also believed that students
with mitigating circumstances
branching from serious
problems, such as poor health
or family issues, would keep
theirissuestothemselvesrather
than reach out to teaching staff
for support, because of the
diminished sense of urgency
an unlimited reduction system
would create.
According to his report,
McCrone played an
instrumental part in working
with QAEC to get the new
policy approved, “I was
personally present at the
meeting and made best efforts
to stand by what students
wanted,” he said.
On McCrone’s blog it read
that he believed, “College
rightfully acknowledged that
this was a population of the
student body which we could
not ignore.” He concludes that
“this is a momentous win for
the Union and for students.”

Representatives. In response
to the debate caused by the
results, a second survey was
put out. A historic 9.13% of the
student body responded to the
poll; the majority of those who
responded, 38%, voted in
favor of the grade reduction.

had voted for the ten percent
