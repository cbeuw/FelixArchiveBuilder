Y
ou know
something is
seriously wrong
in the scientific
community
when you hear
“post-truth” and science
put together. Indeed, this
term, coined international
word of 2016 by Oxford
dictionary has recently been
appearing in headlines
worldwide as a new way
of thinking about science in
this new world we live in. A
world in which – post-truth
defenders claim – objective
facts are less influential in
shaping the public than
emotional appeals. Many
see the election of Trump,
despite his dismissal of what
we often see as clear-cut
science facts (see vaccination
and climate change) as an
exemplification of this new
world order. They see it as
a time of crisis in the science
community, brought about by
the ongoing war between the
educated liberal left and the
ignorant conservative right,
and an opportunity to reform
it. Some even venture to
claim that science is partially
responsible for this change
in world order. Even before
the US election, Nature
magazine columnist Colin
Macilwain stated, “If Donald
Trump were to trigger a
crisis in Western democracy,
scientists would need to look
at their part in its downfall”.
Has science become out of
touch with society, or vice-
versa? Is 21st
century science
really post-truth? A little
analysis on the nature of
scientific enquiry itself helps
to answer these questions.
Firstly, to claim that science
is gearing towards the post-
truth implies two things: that
scientific knowledge is true
and that, throughout history,
scientific truths have been
readily accepted by society.
Most philosophers, however,
including one of the 20th
cen-
tury’s leading ones, Thomas
Kuhn, agree that science
does not present truths but
paradigms – set of conven-
tions by which knowledge
builds in an orderly fashion
to complete a certain world
view established by a found-
ing figure – say, Newton or
Darwin. Inherent in definition
is the fact that revolutions
happen, and therefore
paradigm shifts occur when
new theories are substanti-
ated with sufficient evidence,
such as Einstein’s theories
overthrowing Newton’s and
redefining most of physics.
The development of the theo-
ries behind atoms, the Solar
system or gravity all exem-
plify this changing nature of
scientific knowledge- there is
no truth, just theories substan-
tiated with enough evidence
until the next Rutherford,
Copernicus or Newton came
along with better experiments
to perfect upon them.
It is also a bit ridiculous to
claim that this “post-truth”
idea is a new thing in the
world of science. Theories,
no matter how well-backed
up, have historically taken
real revolutions, defiance and
lives to become integrated
into popular knowledge.
Alfred Wegener died thirty
years before his theory of
continental drift became part
of mainstream science. Arista-
chus’ work on the Heliocentric
theory, dating as far back
as ancient Greece, would
stay forgotten for almost 2
millennia until Copernicus
came along, who then again
saw rejection from most of the
scientific community during
his lifetime. Darwin has a
Galapagos-sized amount
of evidence and yet public
schools in 14 states in the
US still don’t mention his
evolutionary theory in their
curriculum. Galileo Galilei
spent the latter part of his
life under house arrest by
the Roman Inquisition for
supporting geocentrism. Talk
about 21st-
century post-truth
to them.
Those defending that
science needs a reform in
current times point out that
science has become out of
touch with society. It seems
to me however, that never
has it been more in touch. A
rapidly increasing proportion
of scientific papers are freely
available online, university
F
act: You can win
$1,000,000 if you
have ‘supernatural
abilities’.
The “Million Dollar
Paranormal Chal-
lenge” is offered to anyone
who can demonstrate a
supernatural ability under
agreed-upon scientific testing
criteria. In 40 years, despite
over 1000 applicants, no one
ever won.
The prize was offered
by James Randi, a famous
magician, escape artist and
debunker of pseudoscience
and the paranormal. It
started off as a throwaway
comment in an interview, and
snowballed into a 1k, then
10k, then 100k and now 1
million dollar prize. Plenty of
mediums, dowsers and mind
readers have stepped up to
the plate, although according
to Mr Randi very few of them
ever consider that their failure
to complete the testing might
be due to the fact that they
lack supernatural powers,
instead blaming sunspots and
geomagnetic variables…
Think you have a gift?
Unfortunately you’ve missed
the chance to make your mil-
lion; following his retirement,
the James Randi Educational
Foundation has elected to
withdraw the challenge,
instead putting the money
aside for grants to non-profit
groups that promote critical
thinking. I guess that means
he won the bet.

websites are overflowing
with information about cur-
rent research and there’s a
magnificent infinite online
encyclopedia called Google
to answer everyone’s ques-
tions. It takes a two minute
YouTube video to understand
the concept of climate change
and the mountain of evidence
behind it.
The real problem is not that
society does not understand
science, or believe that
scientists should hang around
in their labs all day and write
about their feelings, but that
science does not always
suit everyone’s interests.
Same as evolution didn’t do
great things for Christianism
ideologically, climate change
doesn’t mean great things for
the industries economically.
Trump is not repealing climate
protection policies because
scientists are failing to present
evidence, but because burn-
ing coal is cheap. Blaming
science is not the answer,
protesting against the “incon-
venient-facts-avoiding” is.
