recommendations on how to begin your first adventure
A beginner’s guide to tabletop RPGs

o you want to
learn how I’ve
slaughtered
dragons,
conquered
galaxies, and
made my legend? Well,
you’re in the right place.
RPGs are games where you
assume a character within a
world and basically have an
adventure. So far so video
game; however where table-
top RPGs differ is that instead
of being rendered at 60fps on
your screen, they take place
in the minds of your friends
and yours. This lets you do a
more epic story about saving
the universe than any videog-
ame, as well as craft the sort
of tight-knit stories that only
exist in the best of fiction.
Before you get on with
making your own stories,
you’ll first need to gather
around 2-4 friends. I know,
I know, but it’s definitely
doable. While most people
will be playing their char-
acters, one person will be
in charge of portraying the
world itself. They will be the
aptly named ‘Gamemaster’.
Once you’ve got your group
together and you’ve decided
who’ll be the Gamemaster,
you’ll want to sit down and
have a chat about what genre
and type of game you want
to play. Since many games
have a setting baked into
them, your choice of genre
will have an impact on what
game you end up playing,
and the same with whether
you want a mechanically
the first one. D&D is a fantasy
game where each player is a
fantasy trope such as a Dwar-
ven Cleric, or an Elf Ranger.
Though it can be quite a com-
plex game at times, it does a
decent job at easing you into
it, only reaching stupid levels
when you’ve already played
a bit and have a grasp of
the basics. D&D’s big draw,
however, is its name. It is
much more present in media
than any other RPG, and that
means that it probably has a
higher chance of convincing
your potentially hesitant
friends to jump in and have
a go.
My other suggestion is Fate
Accelerated Edition, a stream-
lined and rules-light system
that focuses much more on
the narrative you construct
and who your characters
are rather than whether you
have a +1 or a +3 in athletics.
With its easy-to-teach and
easy-to-learn rules system,
FAE is perfect for people new
to RPGs. It is entirely genre
independent, so it can be
used to play a Guardians of
the Galaxy style romp as well
as for defeating dark wizards
at the hands of teenagers.
No matter what you want
to play, there’s going to be
an RPG for it. You can forget
your looming deadlines by
slipping into the messy lives
of teenage monsters or by
being female pilots during
WW2. In fact, RPGs are my
favourite way to shirk off
my responsibilities, slipping
into the worlds where I have
achieved so much. And given
the current state of the world,
who doesn’t need that from
time to time?

heavy or light game. Because
this can be a daunting
decision, and for the sake of
brevity, I’m going to suggest
two of my favourites.
My first suggestion is
Dungeons and Dragons 5th
Edition, the big daddy of
tabletop RPGs and arguably

T
here are a million
reasons as to why
food appears in
video games which
is to say there is
only really one
reason: everybody eats. It
might seem obvious but it’s
the truth and when you think
about it, food plays a much
larger role in video games
than what you think.
Take Pac-man for instance,
where the sole purpose of
the game is to get Pac-man to
eat yellow fluorescent blobs.
There are of course other
more descript food items, like
cherries and strawberries,
which when eaten, allow
you to in turn eat the ghosts
who are trying to eat you.
A simple enough dynamic
but one which ultimately
revolves around food.
It’s not just Pac-man or all
these culinary games which
are about becoming the best
chef; most games in general
have some link or relation
to food. Just look at Super
Mario where mushrooms
power you up, or an RPG like
Dragon Age: Origins, where
numerous subplots are based
around getting food, like
helping some thirsty soldiers
or stockpiling cabbages.
consumption is probably one
of the most widespread ways
of representing progression
or health regeneration. Food
is usually a source of comfort,
but in games, it’s a resource,
essential to keep going.
Even though the nature of
food in video games is a bit
monotonous, a lot of cultural
influences can be recognised
in games of recent years.
For example, in the game
GTA San Andreas, when-
ever you eat more fast food,
your avatar starts to put on
the calories and you need
to work out at the gym to
get your weight in check. In
another example, The Legend
of Zelda: Wind Waker fea-
tures ‘grandma’s Elixir soup’
which is the strongest health
potion in the game, not unlike
the real-life chicken soup
counterpart.
Because food is such a
big part of our lives, some
games are going out of their
way to use food, in order to
make gaming a much more
immersive experience. Food
feels good; it’s comforting
and it helps add a layer of
realism and tangibility to
virtual space. Some survival
games are based around
scavenging for the right types
of food to make it through the
day. In fact, some players feel
such an emotional connection
to their food in games that
they replicate a lot of in-game
food items and recipes. Just
run a quick search on google
to see how to make things
like Pokémon Poképuffs and
Portal cake.
Just like in real life, food in
games is about much more
than just pure sustenance as
each item can be enveloped
in many layers of cultural and
emotional baggage. Though
many of the items we come
across may be little more than
health potions at times, they’re
undeniably a crucial element
of the games we love.
