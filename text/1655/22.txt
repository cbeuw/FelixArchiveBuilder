Want some fish in that taco?
Breddos is certainly the place to
get your taco filled - baja fish, fried
chicken or even fried egg are all on
the menu at this trendy Barbican joint.
Join us for a sensual feast of the finest
Mexican cuisine.
T
here’s this one
question I always
get asked: how do
I have the time to
fit in lectures in the
morning, project-
work in the afternoon, while
managing an Instagram story
saturated with #bloggermail,
press events and bearded
baristas in tiny independent
cafés in god-knows-where?
The answer is – I don’t
know. All I know is that my
daily life runs in the time slots
dictated by my little black
Moleskine diary, the grey-bor-
dered rectangles filled
with the worst of squiggles:
reservation for brunch, a PR’s
contact number, deadlines
for reviews… and so on.
I’m someone who likes to
make full use of her 24 hours
– answering emails while
steering away from the Mor-
mons on my way to lectures,
editing photos when the pro-
fessor decides to chat about
Huel instead of hydrogen fuel,
visualizing photoshoot ideas
while dodging pigeons on my
way home.
But why do I keep living this
busy, structured lifestyle? It
may be my pure passion for
food, or the typical Hong-
Kong-ese efficiency running
through my veins, or the
anxiety I inherited from my
mother (which sometimes
makes me miss my Xanax). Or
perhaps, and paradoxically,
the excitement that comes
from spontaneity. Spontane-
ity, that is when one of those
planned time slots suddenly
gets freed up when a lecturer
decides to not come to work,
as happened last Thursday.
That god-sent slot of free-
dom got my cortisol rushing
up to my head. It was an
imperative for me to find
something to fill up those two
hours. What should I do? Do
I have work to catch up on?
Any more emails to answer?
Books to read? Exes to stalk?
That was the moment when
the food-lover side of the
brain came to rescue – Bred-
dos Tacos.
This wasn’t the first time I’d
done such a thing. Yet every
single time these unplanned
adventures get me feeling
fuzzy. I ran past the queue
outside Fusion, slid past a pair
of Mormons down Exhibition
Road, exchanged my lecture
notes for my camera and
hopped on the 30-minute
tube journey to Barbican.
When I reached the door
of Breddos Tacos on 82
Goswell Road, I was quite out
of breath. And speechless at
how the once makeshift taco
shack in a car park in Hack-
ney had transformed into
this hip, stylish, standalone
site. The space was filled by
wooden bar tables, quirky
wall art and a lightbox shout-
ing “COCTELES & MEZCAL”.
I was seated swiftly by the
window looking out to the
quiet cross road between Old
Street and Clerkenwell Road,
next to two business men
sawing through their charred
cuts of beef from the grill over
wine and margaritas.
The menu and two of their
daily salsas arrived with
a friendly waitress, who
recommended some of their
most popular tacos: masa
fried chicken, baja fish and
fried egg, plus a refresh-
ing seasonal hibiscus and
rosehip agua fresca. I went
cilantro and lime. The fried
egg taco came on its own
white plate, the egg in a
perfect circle on the soft corn
tortilla with a bright orange
yolk balancing on top.
After an obligatory round
of photos, my growling
stomach urged me to grab
the fish taco. The tortilla itself
was the size of my palm,
disproportionate with the size
of the fried fish. I folded the
tortilla in half, trying to keep
all the cabbage and lime
mayonnaise goodness inside.
At that point, I knew that all
table manners or any “lady-
ness” had no control over
this meal. I took a gigantic
bite. The party of flavours
burst in my mouth: juices from
the fish, sweetness from the
cabbage, tang from the lime
and the heat from the pico
de gallo salsa. I took a sip of
agua fresca to calm the heat
and continued. The whole
taco was demolished in 30
seconds.
Same happened for the
fried chicken taco. Except
the unexpected fire from the
habanero salsa with the spicy,
crunchy skin on the chicken.
Christy Lam
for exactly those and waited
patiently for the food to
come.
Despite it being the peak of
the lunch hour, it didn’t take
long for my table to be filled
with a fiesta of earthenware,
bright colours and of course,
tacos. The baja fish and fried
chicken tacos came as a pair
on a black, glossy plate,
excitingly Instagrammable
with shreds of red cabbage,
The fried egg taco was like
the slow dance at the end of
a ball, giving a wonderful
applause to the excitement
and fiery heat from before.
The yolk burst into an orange
river, surrounding the bits of
queso fresco, macadamia nut
mole and herbs.
I was tempted by dessert
(come on, leche frita!) but

afternoon – an explosion of
colours, exotic flavours and
delicious food.
