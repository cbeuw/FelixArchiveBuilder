guess I’ll start with a
controversial, but factual
statement: Men don’t live
as long as women do.
Now, would you believe
that this and so many
other gendered beliefs affect
our health habits, including
the foods we choose to eat?
An article in The Washington
Post piqued my interest
lately, focussing on today’s
relationship between meat-
eating and gender. It all
actually may seem pretty
old-fashioned – not all
females like to dine on dainty
pretty kale salads dressed
in hibiscus flowers and not
all men live for burgers
and the Union’s curly fries
(had to throw that one in
as an old Beit-timer, sorry).
However, research shows
these assumptions truly have
historical grounding. In fact,
these eating patterns, socially
influenced or not, could help
explain why men are at
higher risk of heart disease
and some cancers. Perhaps
our ideas about masculinity
do negatively affect our
health.
Professor Luke Zhu at the
University of Manitoba and
Joop de Boer, a retired social
psychologist, detailed that
eating unhealthier food is
psychologically associated
with masculinity, particularly
energy-dense and strong
foods. Conversely, femininity
markers include eating pasta
salad and fruit, or rice and
vegetables with wine for
dinner.
It’s clear to see the health
implications here: Overall,
women, who are more likely
to be more health-conscious
anyway, are choosing
foods with more fiber and
antioxidants, while men tend
to overdo it on saturated fat
Is meat really manly?
Ipsita Herlekar explains how taste and flavour can be brought back in tomatoes
H
ave you ever
wondered why
the tomatoes
in your salad
taste as bland as
cardboard (yes
even the Taste the Difference
one)? That’s because they
actually lack the stuff that
adds taste and flavour, a
recent study has discovered.
For many decades, toma-
toes have been extensively
and selectively cross-bred
for developing new cultivars
that producing larger fruit,
with uniform red colour,dis-
ease resistance and a longer
shelf-life. In this process, the
modern commercial tomato
varieties have lost the genes
responsible for expression of
flavour and taste.
A study by Dr. Harry Klee
and his team from the Univer-
sity of Florida, has shown that
low sugar content and lack of
some volatile compounds is
the chemical reason behind
commercial tomato varieties
being tasteless. In order
to understand the genetic
link, Klee and his team put
together chemical profiles
of commercial and heirloom
varieties, and conducted taste
tests to rate the intensity of
their flavours, sweetness and
sourness.
The right mix of sugars
and volatile compounds is
essential to bring out the
flavours in a tomato. Sugars
and acids present in the fruit
interact with taste receptors
while volatile compounds
interact with olfactory senses,
and combined together they
contribute to the signature
tomato taste. When com-
pared to heirloom varieties,
the commercial varieties had
smaller quantities of sugars
and acids and lacked many
volatile compounds. Thirteen
flavour enhancing volatile
chemicals were identified by
the scientists, many of which
were missing in the commer-
cial tomato varieties.
Besides chemical profil-
ing, using gene-mapping
techniques, researchers have
identified alleles responsi-
ble for giving the tomato its
sweet-tangy flavour. Alleles
are variants of genes that
represent specific charac-
ters like shape, colour, size
or taste of the tomato fruit.
The dominant allele gets
selected and is expressed.
As expected, the commercial
varieties were missing the
right set of alleles needed to
make tomatoes tasty.
Now that the scientists know
\\ Modern tomato
varieties have
lost the genes for
expression of taste
and flavour \\
Making tomatoes tasty again
the chemical recipe required
to make a tomato taste good,
they believe by replacing the
untasty alleles with their tasty
counterparts, commercial
variety of tomatoes can be
made flavoursome again.
Hopefully soon, we will be
able to savour Bloody Marys
with a new piquant flavour.

\\ Eating
unhealhier food
is psychologically
associated with
masculinity \\
and empty calories. The only
exception here is that women
are more likely to have
that glorious (but dainty!)
chocolate pudding with
cardamom-vanilla ice cream
speckled with bits of choco-
late sable. Anyway.
One particularly interesting
angle in this research is that
men and women who see
masculinity and femininity
as less separate categories
aren’t too different in their
meat preferences, while those
with traditional gender beliefs
are more likely to eat more
meat if they’re men. Turns
out it’s all a psychological
thing, meat having patriar-
chal notions of power and
performance.
