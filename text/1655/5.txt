StudentstaketothestreetstoprotestTrump Are the days of political apathy over?
Lef Apostolakis joins the protesters and asks them whether recent
developments have given British politics a second wind
D
onald Trump
has consistently
been on the
collective
consciousness
for a while.
Though Trump’s presidency
could globally affect climate
change and human rights,
to name only a few areas
of concern, amongst some
journalistic circles, there’s
the additional concern
that the international focus
on Trump is steering the
public’s attention away from
important national news.
And whereas that may be
true, it has also undeniably
managed to rile up a
significant proportion of the
population, leading to mass
action across the UK.
Last Friday the news of
Trump’s executive order
banning individuals from
seven Muslim-majority
countries from entering
the US took the
world by storm. As
the ban started
having very real
consequences
for countless
people across
the globe,
#MuslimBan
started trend-
ing on social
media plat-
forms. The very
next day, Owen
Jones called for
an emergency
national demonstra-
tion in London, which
within two days got the
attention and potential
attendance of over 60,000
people.
At Imperial College,
infamous for it’s politically
apathetic student body
the turnout was histori-
cally one of the largest
turnouts in recent memory.
Gasim Gasim, an Electrical
and Electronic Engineering
fresher and first time protester
was impressed. “Imperial
students are not political and
I’ve heard it actually, from
one of our Wardens who
used to be in LSE. One
of our main differ-
ences she said was
that IC students
aren’t political at
all. So it’s nice
to see everyone
coming out
right now.”
The large
turnout is
partially due
to the efforts
of Ariana
Sadr-Hashemi,
a second year
physicist, manag-
ing to coordinate a
sign making workshop
and get over a hundred
students to attend the protest
in unison.
“As an international student,
when I heard about the
march, I knew I wanted to go
and I invited some friends; I
sent it to someone I knew and
they sent it to other people,
and yeah, it just kind of
grew”. It is believed to have
been the highest number of
organised Imperial students
demonstrating in a long time.
The protest itself was
estimated to have been
attended by over 10,000
protesters. As a professional,
I was surprised. Protesting
takes time, energy, planning,
and commitment. Normally I
wouldn’t have been able to
attend due to the workload
and last minute nature of the
event. But I did, not so much
as a reporter (there was no
need, the protest was well
attended and documented
from members of the press
including felix) but as an
individual, adding my voice
to the thousands shouting in
unison “Refugees are wel-
come here”.
I was even more surprised to
bump into a number of friends
and acquaintance from
university, including the Head
of the Student Voice. Though
their attendance wasn’t unex-
pected, the fact that I kept
bumping into familiar faces
was as, those who have ever
taken part in a mass demo
know, finding anyone in a
crowd is near impossible. And
while the massive cat head
on my shoulders certainly
made me more locatable, the
fact remained: an unusually
large number of Imperial
students had been at
the demo.
Monday came
and went, people
in London
and beyond
protested,
statements
were
released and
‘clarifica-
tions’ were
made, but
regardless of
whether we’re
being fair or
not on Trump
(though I person-
ally think that his
dangerous rhetoric
has received not only a
fair, but rather an inade-
quate reaction) an important
side-effect of Trump’s polar-
ising governance seems to
has been the re-ignition (or
at least reinforcement) of the
political spirit of the British
public.
Political apathy is an issue
the UK and other European
countries have struggled with
for decades. The ‘apathetic
youth’ is regularly blamed
for the shortcomings of the
democratic process. In the
UK, there’s been an evident
downwards voting-turnout
trend since the 1940’s. And
even though turnout has been
increasing since the 2001
general election which saw
the lowest ever participation
(59.4 percent) in a general
election in recent British
history, the UK only now hit
pre-noughties levels of vot-
er-turnout this summer during
the EU referendum, where
72.2 percent of the popula-
tion voted.

us back into a politically
energetic state? Sadr-
Hashemi thinks it’s the
polarised political
climate. “When
someone is so
far on one
side of the
political
spectrum
you do get
the uniting
of every-
one who
is more
moderate
kind of
going ‘this is
too much for
me, I’m going
to protest now’”
Robin Saunders
an Imperial alumnus
agrees. “During my time
at Imperial there was a feel-
ing of political apathy. During
my degree we voted in the
coalition and I voted Lib Dem
at the time and had plenty of
years to think over my sins for
that. But there was a general
feeling that democracy was
failing us and that it didn’t
make a difference – even if
you wanted to support the
right cause your voice wasn’t
going to be heard. This is a
powerful sign that this doesn’t
have to be true and that
there’s still life left in the Brit-
ish people and in Imperial.”
To me, this became
particularly obvious right
after the ‘Muslim ban’ took
place, during the prepara-
tion for and participation
in Monday’s anti-Trump
protest outside 10 Downing
St. The emergency demo
was immediately organised

and attended by reportedly
10,000 people in a time-win-
dow of just two days. That
might seem small in compar-
ison to the Women’s March
turnout which took place
in London the week before
and which was reportedly
attended by over 100,000
protesters, however this
would be an unfair compari-
son. For starters, the women’s
march was organised weeks
in advance giving everyone
time to make plans and even
travel into London to partici-
pate in the demo. We need to
also recognise that protesting
takes time and energy. Going
to a protest is not fun, it’s nec-
essary. So to see thousands
of people gather on Downing
Street to protest again so
soon and so spontaneously
was not only extraordinary,
but also a clear sign of politi-
cal involvement.
As Saunders says, “May
might not respond to this
event but if there are people
out there who aren’t sure that
speaking up does anything
we’re here to gather in num-
bers and show them that it
can.”
