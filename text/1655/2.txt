his issue is quite clearly dedicated to food.
Whether you eat it, throw it up, get high on
it, or get down and dirty with it (hey, we
don’t judge) food is a fundamental part of
the human existence. We carefully selected
this week to talk about food, because Eating
Disorder Awareness Week is coming up. Now if you’re
clued up you might say “But isn’t EDAW at the end
of February? Is this a miscalculation? It feels like a
miscalculation. Lef, you literally have one job.”
Although my instinctive reply to such vicious
accusations would be something along the lines
of “SHUT UP”, the honest *cough* truth *cough*
is that we wanted to get you thinking about food in
advance of EDAW, so that when your newsfeed starts
overflowing with Guardian think-pieces on society’s
relationship with food in a few weeks’ time, you can
revel in smugness. Yes. This was totally intentional.
Yup.
In all fairness, given the recent political climate, what
with May and Trump holding hands and all that, we
did consider (and certainly had the opportunity of)
continuing along the themes of political awareness
and resistance, postponing some of the food heavy
content that’s featured this week. However, we have
to admit that the political situation will remain volatile
for the foreseeable future. These are themes that will
permeate most coming issues, one way or another,
and this will be mirrored in the articles you read in the
paper.
But enough about politics for the moment (back to the
streets on Saturday). This paper is about food. Prepare
for a rollercoaster of emotion. You will experience
hunger, you will feel disgust, you will try and suppress
sexual arousal, you will feel disgust again, and then
feel hungry and then confused and by the end of this
issue you will find yourself questioning everything
you ever thought you thought you knew you thought
(has your mind exploded with anticipation yet? And
by mind I mean pants). So please, dig in. Take your
seat at the table, roll your sleeves up and don’t get up
unless it’s for seconds. Bon appetit.
