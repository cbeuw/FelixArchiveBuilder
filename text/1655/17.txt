rafalgar Square’s
Fourth Pinth is a
temporary pedestal
upon which the
best, edgiest, and
most relevant
contemporary sculptures are
displayed, and the latest spot
is now up for grabs. Well,
to one of the five shortlisted
entries, that is. These are
currently up for display (in
miniature-sized versions) in
the National Gallery, and
it makes for an exhibition
well-worth perusing, before
heading upstairs to drool over
the Monets and Van Goghs.
Having housed a diverse
and generally eye-catching
statuary in the past –
including a skeletal horse, a
torso-bust, a rocking horse,
and even a big blue cock –
the plinth currently supports
David Shrigley’s giant
‘thumbs-up’ sign, something
I suppose most London folks
the message is short, simple,
and hard-hitting. Among the
various gallery-wanderers
that I chanced to speak to, it
was the most popular, and I
can see why – it is elegant,
aesthetic, and harkens back
to the values of an art form
that died out with the birth
of contemporary sculpture.
Perhaps it is too old-fash-
ioned, and in this way risks
subverting its own message,
appearing more like nostalgic
yearning than subversion and
progress.
The next in line (as per my
arbitrary ordering) is Michael
Rakowitz’s The Invisible
Enemy Should Not Exist, a
depiction of the Assyrian
winged-bull deity that stood
at the entrance to Nineveh,
and was destroyed by ISIS at
Mosul museum. This version
will be made out of Iraqi
date-syrup cans, representing
an industry that withered
away due to the Iraq wars.
It is a colourful, exotic piece,
and I see the appeal. Meant
to ‘carry on…Nineveh’s
past’, the sculpture hopes
to eventually move to Iraq
for a permanent home. So
why London? Why Trafalgar
Square? To me, it seems
a little out-of-place, and I
rack my brains to see how it
represents London’s vibrant,
modern, and metropolitan
vibe. It is a little too PC, a
little too contrived (made out
of date-syrup cans for added
symbolism?), and a little too
tame for my tastes.
Speaking of tame, the
edge returns with Heather
Phillipson’s The End, a giant
glob of cream with a cherry
on top and a fully-functioning
drone on top of said cherry.
Yes, a drone. On a cherry.
On a glob of cream. Oh, and
a stray fly, perched atop this
monstrosity. There is definitely
something sharp and satirical
about this piece, and feels
more in line with the spirit
of contemporary London; it
reflects the social uncertainty
and political instability of not
only the British Isles but the
world entirely, and the gen-
eral unease over government
and surveillance that has
become almost one of the
defining characteristics of our
generation. I can definitely

for hipster/’modern’ art – is
a brown, nearly-shapeless
block of cork and polysty-
rene. Apparently it harks
back to sci-fi and comic book
symbolism. Apparently it ‘con-
nects’ to African art, Picasso,
and Rodin, among others.
Alas, I am not sure of the
aesthetic value of this work,
nor the message it hopes to
convey. Thanks to this, High
Way is only the second-most
unconvincing piece among
the five.
I won’t mention who I voted
for (yes, the public can ‘vote’
on their favourite and their
comments are even ‘taken
into consideration’!) because
I don’t want to influence my
esteemed readership any
more than I have already. But
I will recommend a visit to this
small but thought-provoking
exhibition (I’ve been twice
already) to make up your
mind for yourself.

the general underground
susurrations (and betting

Don’t hold me to it though. It
may prove to be too edgy,

other works.
The last two are Damián
Ortega’s High Way and
Huma Bhabha’s Untitled, the
former of which is a truck
stacked with oil cans, scaf-
folds, and ladders. It looks
precarious, and is meant
to suggest imbalance and
instability – again, probably
another general political
comment of some sort. Unti-

mock – among other things
– Brexit, and stands tall at a

The new entries are each
unique in their own way. First
among these as you enter
the gallery is a piece from
the Raqs Media Collective
entitled The Emperor’s Old
Clothes, a massive empty
robe that is meant to invoke
the ghost of the British
Empire. It is described as a
‘warning for the future’, and
raises all sorts of questions
about power and those who
have wielded it. The robe is
delicate and billowy, forming
a beautiful work of art as well
as a cautionary symbol, and
