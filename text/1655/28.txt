I
have honestly been so elated
that I have yet to touch the
ground this week. Honestly.
After eight year’s of Barack
HUSSEIN OBama’s liberal-
shariah law agenda being
forced down the throats of hard
working Wall Street bankers,
we finally have the politician
we have all been waiting for. A
politician who does what’s best
for the country as a whole, who
is unafraid to make the difficult
decisions, and who is actually
honest. If we had been given
Shilliary as our next female
president (well technically she’s a
space lizard), then we would have
had to endure lie after lie, with
all her promises being altered by
big business, leaving nothing for
the common man like you and me.
Look at Barack HUSSEIN Obama
– he promised he would close
guantanamo bay within his first
term so that we would no longer
be able to extract information
(torture) out of brown people, but
he never did. The Fuhrer Trump
promised he would build a wall
and keep all muslims out and he
followed through! I wouldn’t be
surprised if he locks Hillary up
sooner or later – maybe a nice
little public execution would heal
our damaged nation?
Now I hear your arguments
about the fact that most terror-
ists have been home grown,
but why can’t you understand
that through blocking the
Hijabs, we will stop them from
importing their radicalisation
chemicals that they hide in
their Halal meat. Admittedly
he hasn’t blocked immigra-
tion from countries like Saudi
Arabia that have actually been
proven to fund terrorism, but
what you need to understand
is that they have a lot of oil…
and something something
intelligence services to keep
us safe. At the end of the day,
however, a muslim is a muslim,
and if they’re kept imprisoned
at airports, then the worst they
can do is blow up those shops
that only sell neck pillows and
overpriced portable chargers.
The next step is to deport all
the libtards and homosexuals;
however we just need a way
to identify known homosex-
uals – I think they generally
wear rainbows, so if we could
fashion a star of david out
of rainbow material i’m sure
the gays would buy it and
that would make life a whole
lot easier. Whilst we’re at it,
I think we could ban vegans
as well. There is something
perverted about someone who
would rather fuck a piece of
fermented mushroom than eat
the delicious flesh of a chicken.
Of course no great detection
strategy is required as all of
them will identify themselves as
soon as they enter the room.
T
his week in light of
recent events, I have
had a change of heart
and have decided that
the protocol of building
walls is actually a
constructive one, and one that I
have decided to take to heart. Of
course what I mean by this is that I
am going to construct an elaborate
wall around myself so that I don’t
have to deal with any of the
world’s bullshit anymore. I have
contacted artisanal brickmakers
in the far east (also known as
shoreditch) and construction begins
within the next few days. I have
chosen the colour of the bricks
to be that of the gender-neutral
shade of yellow, flaxen. This way,
not only will it not trigger me by
conforming to stereotypical gender
colours, but it will also make me
long for the sweet nourishment
of flax seed. It will remind me
of a time before a penchant for
sexual assault was a presidential
characteristic, and racism was an
American pastime.
I shall of course need to bring
company with me for warmth and
consummation; however, after
putting an advertisement on my
local wholefoods bulletin board
and receiving no interested parties
I have had to turn my attention
elsewhere. I have managed to
acquire a vegan goat and it shall
be able to provide for me in many
capacities. First of all, as long
as I keep them (gender neutral
pronouns FTW) sustained on tofu, I
think it shall be acceptable for me
to suck at their teats for food as I
will be more like a family member.
With that said, however, if things
are to happen between the two of
us, then who knows – inside my
walls we can forge new rules and
a new philosophy. I mean as long
as my mum doesn’t find out.
There are a few things that I
imagine I am going to miss like
the sunrise, gluten-free vegan
pizza, and the self satisfaction
when you argue with a stranger
on the internet when they have
used the wrong pronouns on one
of their blog posts. But the sad
reality is that if a large amount of
people disagree with your political
or personal views, then the only
thing you can really do is isolate
yourself. If you feel as though the
general world is no longer making
sense, then don’t do anything
constructive – post articles on
facebook, and go to protests with
other left wing people so that you
can maintain that bubble you are
in. I’ll see you all in four years, and
hopefully I will not have fucked my
goat too much by then.
Fuck this shit, I’m
reclaiming the wall
Jonathan Masters is running
away from civilisation and taking
a goat with them.
Happy days are
here again and it
looks like they’re
here to stay
