ast week the Israeli
Ambassador to
Britain, Mark Regev
visited Imperial
College, giving a talk
in the Clore Lecture
Theatre in Huxley Building.
The talk, for which publicity
was incredibly limited, was
attended by around 200
students and was shrouded in
secrecy right up until the very
last moment.
Originally an email was
circulated to students taking
part in some Horizons
courses, advertising a talk
with “a representative” for
“an evening of candid debate
and discussion on Middle
Eastern matters” and giving
nothing further away about
the speaker. On the day of
the talk the attendees were
given the location as well
as a set of instructions: Two
forms of ID would be needed,
no bags inside the venue,
no mobiles to be used in the
venue, and no social media

both the lack of an opposing
viewpoint as well as the
secrecy surrounding the
event. “It is quite worrying
that the College did not think
to invite an opposing view to
help balance the conversation
themselves. This would’ve lead
to a much more open-minded
and fruitful discussion with
different perspective being
expressed...Further still, the
fact that the event was not
publicised properly... is, in
itself, disheartening.” They
added, “such questionable
methods raises certain moral
andethicalconcerns;thiscould
very well lead to the belittling
of our university’s free thinking
and challengeable identity, a
frankly horrific and disturbing
notion.”
When contacted by felix,
Imperial’s Israeli Society
explained how they had
no part in the facilitation of
the event as they were “a
non religious and apolitical
society… We like to make an
emphasis on the fact that we
are the Israeli society and not
theIsraelsociety.Werepresent
a people, the Israelis and not
the Israeli Government.”
An Imperial College
spokesperson said “Imperial
strives to provide opportunities
for its community to hear
a wide range of views,
and space for debate and
discussion, in accordance
with the College’s Freedom
of Speech policy. The security
arrangements made by the
College for a high profile
speaker like this obviously
took account of advice from
the Metropolitan Police, and
there were no security issues
during the event.” On the topic
of holding similar events in the
future they added “we shall
continue to provide support
for a broad spectrum of
speakers to visit the College.”
Dr Matthew Wraith, a
politics lecturer at Imperial,
chaired the talk and
introduced Ambassador
Regev who started with
a 15 minute introductory
speech. In these opening
remarks Regev outlined what
he thought were the two
essential pillars needed for
peace agreement to happen,
“Mutual recognition” and
“security”. On the first point
the Ambassador stressed that
recognition of the legitimacy of
the other sides claim was key
and put forward a thesis that
the reason for conflict is not
that Palestinians don’t have a
state, instead that “the reason
there is a conflict is because
the Jews have a state”.
Ambassador Regev then cited
the various partition plans
brought forward that were
accepted by the Israelis but
rejected by the Palestinians.
Regev went on to question
the meaning of peace without
this mutual recognition, saying
that to Hamas it was a peace
that would enable them to use
a partial Palestinian state as a
vehicle to destroy the rest of
Israel.
Dr Wraith later accused this
criticism of the Palestinian side
as hypocritical, referencing
Israel’s acceptance of the
1937 Peel Partition which was
based on the same principle
(David Ben-Gurion, first Prime
Minister of Israel, said at the
time “[I am] not satisfied with
part of the country, but on the
basis of the assumption that
after we build up a strong force
following the establishment of
the state, we will abolish the
partition of the country and
we will expand to the whole
Land of Palestine.”)
On the aspect of security
Ambassador Regev insisted
that “If you can’t defend the
peace then the peace won’t
last”, especially in the unstable
climate currently present in the
Middle East.
The Ambassador then went
on to say that the Israelis
are willing to return to the
negotiating table with no
preconditions, allowing the
two sides to “give and take”
towards a peace treaty. The
fact that the Palestinians had
not returned to the negotiating
table recently was because
they “prefer to go to the UN,
they prefer to UNESCO,
they prefer to get resolutions
in multilateral fora voting
against Israel”. This then led
onto a point in which Regev
felt that Israel was unfairly
discriminated against by
these bodies and because the
Palestinians have an automatic
majority, “everyone agrees
at the UN it’s always Israel’s
fault”.
In the questions section the
topics of settlements, Kurdish
independence, Israeli nuclear
weapons, a one state solution,
and Donald Trump were
brought up amongst other
things. A video of the full event
is due to be released at some
point in the future.
To understand how this event
came to be, we approached
Dr Wraith. He explained that
it was the Israeli Embassy
who had first approached him
for the Ambassador to visit
Imperial and not the other way
around. “[The ambassador]
said ‘I want to come and
speak to Imperial’ and I said
‘Do you want to speak to my
class or make it a more public
event?’ He said ‘either’ and
I said ‘both’”. The talk at Dr
Wraith’s class happened a few
months ago and was attended
by about 30 students.
The ambassador likely
visited Imperial as part
of Israel’s wider anti-BDS
(Boycott, Divestment and
Sanctions) strategy, especially
considering Israel’s high tech
economy in conjunction to
Imperial’s STEM expertise.
Universities up and down the
country have implemented
boycotts of varying degrees,
with three Imperial academics
signing an open letter last
year which pushed for an
‘academic boycott’ of Israeli
universities.
Wraith, who had a large
hand in the initial logistics of
the event, also spoke about
how the security precautions
ramped up around the event
as the police were scared of
a repeat of the scenes seen at
King’s College and UCL last
year in which protesters on
both sides clashed at events
with pro-Israel speakers. Dr
Wraith was pleased with the
success of the talk and the
fact that “we’ve proved to the
College that the sky doesn’t fall
in when you have a political
figure come to campus and
I hope they’ve taken that on
board.”
Farri Gaba, an aeronautics
student, attended the talk last
week and is in the process of
organising a similar event with
the Palestinian representative
to the UK, Manuel Hassassian.
“I realised that the general
student body has the right to
hear both sides of the conflict.
It makes for fair and educated
judgement of both the current
situation and the future
solution.”
Palestinian Society is also
planning on holding future
events too and condemned

use. Further to this was the
threat of disciplinary action
should you fail to “conduct
yourself in a professional and
respectful manner”. Outside
the event was a sizeable
police presence, with a cohort
of security in black overcoats
pacing inside the lecture
theatre too (I think one of them
may have received a Fitbit for
christmas he was circling that
much).
