Hockey U.L. Cup
I.C. FOIL C.E.M
and a Slippery Pitch
I.C. the present U.L. League
leaders lined up on Wed 9th Dec.
against a C.E.M. side containing
2 U.L. players and an England
under 23 international. This was
the rather grim cup quarter-final
match which I.C. faced at
C.E.M.'s home ground at Hinch-
ley Wood. The opening moments
were occupied with mid-field
sparring in which I.C. soon
achieved the upper hand and in
the fifth minute E. Hough slipped
through the middle to beat the
goalkeeper and score with a re-
verse stick shot.
The home side, holders of the
cup, were shaken by this and
after ten minutes of steady pres-
sure a flicked centre from the left
was clipped into the goal again by
Hough.
This pressure, apart from
sporadic C.E.M. breakaway at-
tacks, continued for the rest of
the half without success, Macken-
zie being very unlucky to miss by
inches from the edge of the circle
as he was upended.
After the interval, the C.E.M.
side was changed around, Mason,
the England player being'moved
to inside right
For the opening 15 mins. of
this half the team's concentration
waned slightly and the Cemian
forwards took immediate advan-
tage of this. Lapses of marking
on both sides of the field enabled
a centre from the right to be
stroked into the net by the inside
left.
This goal combined with the
enthusiasm of I.C.s few but voci-
ferous supporters stirred the team
out of their day-dreaming and for
the last fifteen minutes they were
pressing hard once again. When
the final whistle came, however,
the score card still read 2-1 in
EC's favour. Throughout, the
standard of play was much higher
than could be expected on such a
slippery pitch. On this, both
sides are to be congratulated.
Although C.E.M., on their own
admission, are not as strong as
last year, when they thrashed
U.C. 6-1 to win the cup, this re-
sult gives the I.C.' team a moral
boost which may well be sufficient
to take them to the league, Cup,
and six-a-side treble coverted by
all.
Squash
Lack of Courts
"Inconvenient"
By R. W. Scott
Once the lassitude induced by
the fine summer vacation had
been shaken off, the 1st V has
enjoyed a large measure of suc-
cess. So far this season, matches
have been much closer than last
year since I.C. has lost some lead-
ing players, The Freshers show
much promise and are benefiting
from the tougher squash played
at College.
The team had a very enjoyable
trip to Cranwell during October,
recording the first win; and early
in November two teams visited
Cambridge. Each won one, and
lost the second of its matches.
The Club, however, still only
offers very limited facilities.
Although this has not affected
the spirit of 1st and 2nd team
players, it has meant that other
members of the Club have not
had a fair crack of the whip. In
spite of the facilities it is very
creditable that upon average, at
least two 1st V and one 2nd V
matches are played each week.
Like Swimming and Rifle, the
Squash Club eagerly look for-
ward to the completion of the
Sports Centre.

MIXED SUCCESS
By M. Fitzgerald
Recently, the I.C. first team
lost its first league match in four
years, being defeated 4-5 by
Kings College.
This fixture clashed with the
British Universities Sports Feder-
ation (B.U.S.F.) Championships
and as I.C.'s two U.L. players
competed, the team was consider-
ably weakened.
The Mixed team are still un-
beaten with recent victories over
U.L. (6-3) and Bart's Hospital
(5-4). The latter win was achieved
against a team which contained
two county players and one U.L.
player. D. Forster and Miss D.
Wokes won two games, and D.
Fisher and Miss K . Seneviratne
won one game 15-11 in the third
set, after trailing 6-11.
After losing the first four games
of the match, I.C. 2nd team sur-
prised Goldsmiths by beating
them 54.

This term apparent apathy am-
ong other London fencing clubs
has restricted the number of
matches fought to four, of which
I.C. won two, drew one and lost
one.
The recently acquired electrical
equipment was put to good use in
the recent "Goddin C u p " be-
tween London colleges, when
both the 1st and 2nd I.C. teams
were unlucky not to gain pro-
motion from the quarter-finals.
