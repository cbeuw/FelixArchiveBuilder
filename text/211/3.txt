THIS YEAR'S
C h r i s t o p h e r Tye investigates
the N o t t i n g Hill Housing Trust
The Housing P r o b l e m
If you go to Holland Park and then walk north along Clarendon
Road, the character of the houses soon changes from smart whi'e-
painted ones at the south to the delapidated and crumbling one?
at the north. In the Notting Hill and Ladbroke Grove area there
some appalling slums. In this area several families have a home con-
sisting of just one room.
There are now some 1,000 homeless families in L . C C . Reception
Centres, 6,500 people in London are homeless at the present time.
There are thousands of families in London living in one room and
paying £3 to £5 a week for it.
The roots of the housing problem would seem to be in the fact
that there is a shortage of family-type accommodation in London.
Low-income families are charged high rents. Many are exploited,
and Rachmanism continues even now.
The Swifts in their new house renovated by the Trust.
The Trust
Bad housing and complete
lack of housing are the root
causes of many urgent social
problems, e.g. divorce, disease
and crime. A small group of
people who live and work in Not-
ting Hill banded together to fight
the housing problem. They
formed the Notting Hijl Housing
Trust, on 20th Dec. 1963.
This charitable trust has two
main objects:—
(1) To provide homes for
families and old people who are
either homeless or living in
grossly overcrowded conditions.
(2) To provide rehabilitation
where this is necessary.
The short-term objectives are
to train the victims for higher
paid jobs—this will increase their
self-respect and ease their finan-
cial problems.
The Solution
The solution 10 the problem is
obviously a political one in the
long run. Both the major poli-
tical parties agree that it will take
ten years to rehouse the present
victims.
But something must be done
now! In ten years time the
children will be embittered
adults, old folk will have died in
squalor, and many couples will
be soured by mean married lives.
At Present
Some examples of the shocking
conditions found around Notting
Hill are given below :
(1) An expectant mother, father
and two children lived in a
basement room ten foot
square. Rain came through
the window and rats came in
at night. The rent was
£3 10s. a week. They have
now been rehoused by the
Trust.
(2) A family of six live in one
dark, damp room. They
have no kitchen and no hot
water. The cold water tap is
shared by 13 people. The
lavatory is shared by 19
people. They pay £5 10s.
rent a week.
(3) A man earning £9 a week
pays £6 rent for the room in
which he lives with his
family of six.
(4) A family of nine live in one
small room. One daughter
left home to find a room of
her own. She is now a pros-
titute.
(5) A man aged 20 was evicted
with his family four times,
twice violently after mid-
night. He rebelled against
society by stealing and is
now a convict.
When the Labour Government
repeals the 1957 Rent Act, rent
control will be brought back and
there will be more control of evic-
tions. But the number of flats in
London is not going to increase
over-night (if anything they will
be harder to get) so the problem
of overcrowding and homeless-
ness will remain.
W h a t They Do
The Trust is buying large
houses, converting them (partly
with volunteer labour) into good
simple homes which are then let
at reasonable rents to the most
needy members of society with no
distinction between colour or
creed.
The full-time administration
staff consists of three people who
work in an unpretentious office in
Notting Hill. They have given up
jobs with salaries between £2,000
and £740 and now work for a
joint salary of £250 per year. So
far the administration costs
amount to only 2 per cent, of the
money received.
A full-time master-carpenter is
also employed at a low salary.
He directs the rebuilding opera-
tions often done by volunteer
work parties. When the funds
permit, it is intended to employ
a housing manager, an electrician
and a plumber.
Rev. Ken rick
The Chairman of the Trust is
Rev. Bruce Kenrick a Presby-
terian Minister who lives in Blen-
heim Crescent, Notting Hill. He
was very pleased that the Union
had decided to support the Trust
for this year's Charity Carnival.
He came to the first meeting of
the Carnival Committee to ex-
plain what the Trust was doing.
He was interested to learn of the
proposed Carnival activities and
he offered his help in several
ways.
He has one slight worry—that
some irresponsible action in aid
of the Carnival might damage the
reputation of the Trust. We must
make sure that this does not
happen.
Local Charity
Because this Charity is local we
can do more than just raise
money. It is believed that there
are several students in I.C. who
will be willing to form working
parties to go up to Notting Hill
and help the Trust in its work of
converting Houses into flats.
Parties from the Anglican Chap-
laincy are already doing this. It
is hoped to organise several
others next term.
Renovation in Progress in Notting Hill
Finance
As the Trust has been in opera-
tion for only just a year it is in
great need of money; every penny
received is urgently needed. By
using L.C.C. Loans and Local
Authority Grants each pound
given does the work of many
more. The funds are managed by
a finance committee consisting of
three chartered accountants, a
solicitor, a tax expert, a High
Court Judge and a Q.C.
£650 given to the Trust will
install a family of six in a per-
manent house.
£200 given to the Trust will
give a permanent home to an old-
age pensioner.

Well, I.C. students, the rest is
up to you. The Carnival can use
you in some way, and every effort
made will bring in some cash
which will be gratefully received
by the Notting Hill Housing
Trust.
