FELIX 9
Soccer : U.L. Cup
Late Recovery
Destroys Woolwich
By R. Grundy
I.C. 5 — 2 Woolwich Poly.
On December 5th at Harlington, I.C. 1st XI managed to shed
at least a little light on the grey, murky afternoon when they beat a
competent Woolwich Polytechnic side in thefirstround of the 'U.L.
Cup Competition. This was an impressive display by I.C. and the
team should do well if the defence can learn to settle down a little,
earlier in the game.
In the first half, the home team
strove in vain to make any impres-
sion, and the defence was continu-
ally tested by the opposition's
ability to make very good use of
the through ball on the slippery
surface. Indeed, the sbaky de-
fence eventually cracked when
slack tackling allowed the Wool-
wich inside-forward to run the
ball twenty five yards before
shooting past Ingram.
Surprisingly, Woolwich in-
creased their lead within minutes
from a somewhat similar situa-
tion. The I.C. defence again failed
to clear and the Woolwich centre-
forward managed to screw the
ball into the corner of the net.
Little was seen of the I.C. attack
at this stage; with Huxtable fight-
ing a lone battle " up front,"
little headway could be made.

After the interval, I.C. reap-
peared as a changed side and
opened their account immedi-
ately : a throw-in found Eastell
in the inside-right position and his
centre to the far post was headed
home by Vaughan. This goal
inspired I.C. to signs of former
greatness and thev proceeded to
play some delightful football, the
defence linking up well with the
forwards. I.C. drew level when
the tireless Vaughan shrugged off
twb tackles and squared the ball
for Eastell IO score off the left-
hand post.
The trio of Huxtable, Vaughan
and Stoddart, on the right then
ruthlessly crushed all hopes for
Woolwich, by this time a sadly
dispirited side.
Twice, Stoddart's centres were
arrogantly turned into the net by
Huxtable. I.C. appeared to slack
off a little after this spate of goals
and Woolwich were allowed to
regain some of their former poise,
but the defence, and some dubi-
ous tackling by Fairholme, Grif-
fith and Basnet nad at last
mastered the through ball.
Almost on the stroke of time
when fog made the game difficult
to follow, the ever-unquenchable
Vaughan found himself eight
yards out with his back to the goal.
Only this ebullient Welshman
could have back-heeled the ball
with such a mixture of profes-
sionalism and the comic.
Team :
Ingram, Fairholm, Basnet,
Hunt, Griffith, Johnson,
Stoddart, Vaughan, Huxtablc,
Eastell, Batcup.
Rowing
This term has been one mainly
of technique coaching, leading
up to the U.L. Winter VIII's Re-
gatta for the junior and novice
crews which was held on Sat. Dec
5th.
As a result of last year's suc-
cesses, the I.C. crews had to com-
pete in events of a higher stan-
dard. In all races the College
crews lost narrowly to the winners
and/or the losing finalists, who
IN TOUCH
O
n Sports Writing
In the opinion of the Sports Editor, these jew columns should
present reports and features that make informative and interesting
reading to the whole spectrum of readers of Felix. Surely this part
of the paper is serving little useful purpose if say, the hockey players
cannot find anything to interest them except rushing through the
hockey report looking for their own names.
The main trouble with reports at the moment is that they tend
to be too general:
" The Club expects a very successful season " or
" After the intervale I.C. fought back brilliantly."
Platitudes like this are dull and hardly informative. One of the
reasons for this defect is probably that it is the captains of the clubs
who write the reports. Most of them have enough to do anyway and
by the time they get round to writing, all the details are forgotten.
The policy of the Swimming Club is to be recommended. A
specific member of the club is made responsible for submitting reports
and when he attends matches, a mental note, at least, is made of
ideas and details for his next report. Surely every club has at least
one member eager to see his words (slightly edited perhaps) in print.
And photographers would be welcomed with open arms.
Yet, reports of matches alone do not make a very impressive
sports page, Feature-type articles are desperately needed, reflecting
opinions, arguements etc. in the various clubs.
However, the Sports Editor would like to thank members of all
the Clubs who have submitted reports this term, there has never been
a lack of copy. Next term it is hoped to take some " recreational "
activities under the wing of these columns; viz. Billiards and Snooker,
Chess. Glidina, Ski and Ten-Pin Bowling.
in the junior events were the
regular 1st VIII's of U.C. and
Guys Hospital. After only nine
weeks' rowing experience, the
I.C. Novice crew did very well to
hold the winners, Kings 2nd VIII
to one length after a very close
race. These crews obviously have
a deal of ability and more exten-
sive training should bring some
good results in the near future.
At the end of term, the I.C.
crews will be taking part in the
Thames Plum Pudding Race and
one should then be able to judge
the abilities of the two senior
VlII's who have not yet raced.
Judo
"Maitta" - Brum
Declare to l.C.
On Sat. Dec. 5th., the Judo
Club completed this term's fix-
tures with two matches against
Birmingham University. As the
opposition was not exoected to
warrant taking a full i t teum,
I.C. competed with what amoun-
ted to an " A " team. The new-
comers to the 1st team, were D.
Eccles and T. Vickers. Both
fought well and the former re-
corded a convincing win in the
first contest which I.C. won 4-2J.
In the second contest, Krikor and
C. Cohen were outstanding for
I.C. and largely responsible for
the 4-1 victory.
After nine weeks of successful
competition, the general moral of
the Club is high and the teams are
looking forward to the Inter-
Collegiate Championship of Gt.
Britain next February. It is hoped
that last year's victory will be re-
peated.
Rifle Club
ON TARGET
The Rifle Club is quietly shoot-
ing itself into prominence despite
the lack of a range of its own.
The " A " team has beaten
QMC and Kings and drawn with
Battersea, and now leads Div. 1
in the Engineers' Cup, while the
" B " team is 2nd in Div. 2. The
Novices team is somewhat erratic,
but several members shoot use-
fully for the " A " and " B " teams.
In the Standing and Kneeling
League the " A " team is so far
unbeaten, again leading the divi-
sion, while the " B " team is 3rd.
The Pistol Team, led by T. Free-
man, the U.L. Pistol Secretary
and aided by J. Coombs (ex-QMC
pistol champion) is apparently
unbeatable at the top of the
league.

Fives
By I. Collins
The Fives Club gropes toward
the end of the first term of its
renascence, and seeks respite
there. The club's tiny member-
ship has met regularly, and
several useful players have been
introduced to the game.
Having inherited few regular,
annual fixtures, the hunt for op-
position is on, and thus I.C. has
only played three matches to
date—losses every one, but ia.ll
against good sides, and no defeat
was belittling.
Whilst in the first two matches
against St. Thomas' Hospital and
the Clove Club, the I.C. strings
lost to each of the opponents',
the match against the U . L .
" Ravens" was a much closer
affair. l.C. were 2 points -up at
the half-way stage, after both
players had met thefirstU . L .
string.

However, I.C. players often

out-of-touch game. To a man, the
FEWSTRINGS
ATTACHED
I.C. strings gave the latter display
against the second half of the
U.L. team, and so the final score
dissembled justice.
The I.C. strings have so far
been unchanged for match play.
The senior side, by virtue of age
alone, one may add, is D. Telfer
and I. Collins, and I.C. "Junior"
consists of two Freshers, D. Mc-
Bain and P. Combes. With im-
proved concentration and conse-
quent standard of play, the abyss
of next term's fixtures looks
scaleable from the Christmas
plateau.
