WELLSOC, 7th DECEMBER
Dr. Arkold E . Bender, trea-
surer of the Nutritional Soc.,
shortly to be senior lecturer at
Queen Elizabeth CoUege.
Worldwide Famine
Dr. Bender told a small, but soon intensely attentive audience,
that if homo sapiens continue to eat and multiply regardless as they
have done to the present day, we will be starving by the turn of the
century. So convincing were the facts and figures presented—one
left with the feeling that if something is not done soon, nuclear war
will seem an easy way out.
Half the population of the
world today are either mal-
nourished or starving. Popula-
tion is still increasing at a con-
siderably greater rate than food
production. Only two per cent,
of the world's total food produc-
tion crosses its frontiers (a large
proportion of this is consumed in
Britain) and increasing population
is reducing the available exports.
A GORDIAN KNOT
Economic, Political and Hu-
manitarian aspects of the problem
bind it into a veritable gordian
knot that can best be attacked on
the level of intelligent and whole
hearted world co-operation. Ex-
perience has shown that even on
a comparatively small scale,
where an extraordinary degree of
concerted effort is exerted, in this
direction (Mexico) the resulting
local improvement is barely that

posed Mike and is in charge of

which is urgently required on a
worldwide scale. The problems n
attaining this degree of concerted
effort on a worldwide scale are
obviously enormous.
PROBLEMS A N D ANSWERS
Politicians deny the masses free
food in the pursuit of a non-align-
ment policy; Catholics walk out
of conferences on birth control;
the peasant is loath to give up his
traditional ways. Fertilizers mean
industry, and marketing requires
transport. The problem is im-
mense.
The answers to a lot of the
problems are now at hand, but
not the means for implementing
them. The yield of the land can
be increased. The nutritional
value of present foods can be im-
proved. Hitherto untappsd sour-
ces such as the sea and the protein
in foliage can be utilized to their
full extent.
A few interested and dedicated
people have shown great in-
genuity, but until the implications
of the present situation are thor-
oughly understood by politicians,
administrators, and, indeed, the
people, little will come out of the
ideas at hand.

FIRST NIGHT
DRAM. SOC Tuesday, 8th December
Robert Bolt's " A Man For All Seasons" sympathetically
explores the relationship between Henry VIII, his court, and Sir
Thomas More. We are shown Sir Thomas More, a mild man of
letters and art, his almost casual involvement in politics, and his
tragic end, led to the gallows by his honesty and faith ; Hugh Frazer
portrayed him admirably, not as a simpering intellectual, but wi h a
convincing forthrightness.
He was backed by a strong cast—Jane Watts, as his wife Lady
Alice, was perhaps a little too bitchy, Diana Warwick as his daughter
Lady Margaret was what I expected a 16th century daughter to be.
Antony Stevens as the King was a fair blend of randy charm and
arrogance and it is regrettable that the play did not allow us to see
more of him.

thods at I.C. The matter was re-
ferred to Council for discussion
before the end of term.
G R A N D L A R C E N Y
Barry Mair, the Deputy Presi-
dent, answered charges regarding
the long hours expected of the
cloakroom attendants. The rota
that they are now working was
their own plan and, because he
thought it far from ideal, he had
suggested that they only do a trial
period.
The previous weekend had seen
two cases of larceny, and it had
been necessary to bring in the
CID. A coat had been stolen
from the Union cloakroom on the
night of the R.C.S. Smoking Con-
cert, and a suitcase, whose con-
tents were valued around £50 (he
described as " A case of grand
larceny ") was removed on Mon-
day morning. Greater security
measures were introduced imme-
diately.
0 Jewish Society favoured a
payment increase. This, Mr.
Mair said, was an I.C. matter;
the Union did not pay the men.
SOUTHSIDE
•Pete Walton, Southside, R.C.S.
Secretary commenting on week-
ends in Southside, said, " It seems
a pity to employ so many men
for so few coats." It was pro-
posed that the pigeon-holes in the
Southside cloakroom be replaced
by racks because it was possible
that the cloakroom was little used
as people objected to having their
coats rolled up in such a fashion.
President Price expressed sym-
pathy and agreed to look into the
matter.
A request was also made that
in Southside the seat covers be
cleaned, and that waste bins be
placed in the T.V. lounge in view
of the extra litter created by the
coffee machine. Waste bins had
been on order since the beginning
of term.

Mr. Tutelman, who led the
group fo I.C. supporters to Man-
chester for University Challenge,
criticised the treatment given
them by Granada T.V. He in-
quired if Mr. Price had received
any written undertaking, but the
latter apologised for his failure
to bring the letter to the Meeting.
If the complaint were justified,
however, he would write.

Timothy Watson merits special
mention as the Common Man
who provided light relief and tried
his hand at everything from bar-
man to headsman. Less attractive
characters were well put over too.
Alan Auchterlounie as the Duke
of Norfolk, a falcon-flying noble,
Richard Mayers as Cardinal Wol-
sey (a little too much of a swine,
I think), and Michael Cope as
Thomas Cromwell, whose cold-
blooded politics sent Sir Thomas
to the block. Stephen Lloyd's
Richard Rich got off to a weak
start, but soon showed the inade-

CLARIFICATION
In our issue of 2nd December
we published a reference to Rule
3 (B) (11) of the Rules of the
A.Sc.W. which, it has been sug-
gested, was open to the construc-
tion that Rule 3 (B) (11) gave the
Branch Committee power to dis-
pense Union funds for political
objects at the Committee's dis-
cretion.
In fact under Rule 74 only the
Executive Committee of the
Union has power to dispense its
funds and political expenditure
must come from a Special Poli-
tical Fund, and can only be ap-
plied to political objects defined
by the Trade Union Act 1913.
In addition we are asked by the
Branch Committee to state that
as a committee they have no
political affiliation.
STOMPS ARE BACK
"Man, what an atmosphere—
and those chicks, too!" A typical
comment at one of the South Side
Stomps last year, although of
course the Jazz Club's main aim
in running the Stomps had been
to provide some first class jazz
for listening and dancing.
Next term the stomps are back,
the first one being on Jan. 13th.
Two, and sometimes three, bands
will be appearing at each stomp
to provide a variety of types of
music from basic rock jazz to the
roaring sound of the I.C. Big
Band and the emotional subtlety
of the Jazz Congress.
Start next term right by going
to the first Stomp—you won't re-
gret it!
A L HIGSON
adequate but not Spanish enough.
William Roper did well as the
angry young son-in-law. Other
parts were played by Derek Mel-
leney, Christopher Shelton and
Lesley Slater. The producer was
Catherine Robins.
The set failed to satisfy some-
how—perhaps it was its extreme
asymmetry that jarred. These are,
however, only trivial criticisms
and it is sad to report that such
an effective production was so
badly supported. What support
there was seemed to come from
outside I.C. I really wonder if
I.C. students have anything better
to do with their time?
