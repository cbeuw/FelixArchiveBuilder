6 FELIX
v.s.o.
V.S.O. is an organisation run on amateur and inefficient lines.
When V.S.O. was started several years ago by Alec Dickson it
was almost exclusively for school-leavers and apprentices. During
this period it operated on a shoe-string, supported by voluntary sub-
scriptions from firms and individuals and by a small grant from
government departments. The staff was largely part-time and there
was a feeling that idealism and enthusiasm would solve everything.
It was fairly common for volunteers to arrive in the host
country and find either that there was no job for them or that the
job was not really worth doing. Happily this is now a thing of the
past. Since V.S.O. started a graduate section it has been taken
very much under the wing of the British Council. The new offices
in Hanover Street have an air of efficiency about them that was almost
completely missing in the old offices in the Commonwealth Society.
To-day V.S.O. itself and the British Council try to investigate all jobs
before volunteers are sent; naturally this cannot be perfect but errors
are becoming increasingly rare.
Secondary School Biology Instruction.
If I volunteer what sort of job am
I likely to be given ?
The vast majority of volunteers
are given teaching jobs in secon-
dary schools, universities, tech-
nical colleges and teacher train-
ing colleges. However, there are
a few jobs available in other
fields : last year three civil en-
gineers went abroad, a forensic
chemist to British Guiana, and
geologists to Borneo. Each year
several other specialists are asked
for but these are far fewer than
the unmber of teachers required.
SHORT
Tizard Hall's Mulled Wine
Party on Sunday 6th December
was attended by senior members
of staff, including the Rector. It
is meetings such as this that will
bring the staff and students closer
together. Unfortunately only two
Mews' residents were able to at-
tend.
A member of the Felix Staff
recently had a very welcome
windfall to the tune of £398 18s.

year!
There were over a hundred
coats on the counter of the South-
side cloakroom a week ago last
Sunday, because no cloakroom
attendant was on duty. This
seems surprising after the discus-
sion in the Union meeting (see
front page).
EXPLOSION
And at the tliirteenth hour . . .
Had the Watchmen of the
Guard executed their duties dili-
gently on the night of December
3rd, perhaps ye Houses of Weeks
would not have suffered a das-
tardly attempt to eliminate the
sub-keeper and all others therein.
Shortly after 1 a.m. the three
score and six bedchambers were
rocked by the effects of a revolu-
tionary gunpowder detonating
device " placed in the refuse re-
ceptacle cunningly concealed in
the centre of the landing.
The sub-keeper, shortly after-
wards emerged in his night-attire,
and was heard to he muttering
suitable thanks for salvation in
the modern Australian idiom.
So great was the explosion, that
residents in the servants quarters
opposite, and in Southside
Towers were awakened, as were
residents in the higher reaches of
the Houses of Weeks.
Voluntary Service Overseas is an organisation about which one
hears a lot of contradictory statements and about which all prospec-
tive volunteers have a lot of questions. To-day FELIX attempts to
deal with a few of the most common and important items.

If, when I arrive in the country, 1
find I do not like the job or am
not «uited for it, is there any-
thing that can be done ?
On the whole volunteers are
expected to tackle anything and
once they have volunteered to
stick whatever they may be given,
(but -if it is a case of the job not
existing or being unsuitable, then
the British Council on the spot
will investigate, and arrange an
alternative, if they feel that it is
warranted.
V.S.O. is patronising in its atti-
tude and full of do-gooders.
It may have been in the past,
but to-day things are changing.
The newsletter was the prime ex-
ample of this, one such article in-
cluded these thoughts : " If you
are faced with a strange dish
which you feel you cannot take,
then close your eyes and think of
England." The first graduates to
go out under the. scheme com-
plained bitterly about this and
there are signs that this may be
changed.
Have any graduates from Im-
perial College been abroad
with V.S.O.?
Although the graduate section
of V.S.O. has only been in opera-
tion since 1962 ten volunteers
have gone abroad under the
scheme, six to secondary schools
to teach sqience, three to techni-
cal colleges, and one to a teacher
training college.
What is there in it for me ?
To be honest, the modern atti-
tude in V.S.O. is more concerned
with what there is in it for the
country concerned than you. You
can expect to work harder than
you have ever done in your life,
to find that there are not nearly
fenough hours in the day to ac-
complish what you would like to
do. In return, you will get the
satisfaction of doing a worth-
while job, do not expect to be
working under close supervision
or even with much help on the
jdb. . V.S.O. volunteers have
found themselves as senior science
masters in schools, or even in
some cases headmasters. How-
ever, V.S.O. ca/i promise you a
year or two that you will never
forget; a lot of volunteers do de-
cide to stay on for a second year
after completing the first. At the
end there is a generous resettle-
ment grant, £100 for the first year
and a further £100 for a second.
