opposed, seconded by Gordon H a l l who
combatted Mr. McAuley's irrelevance
i n kind. Speeches from the f l o o r were
s p i r i t e d , the Late News Editor excel-
l i n g himself.
Result: Carried 13 - 11 with .
k abstentions. Mike Edwards.

kindly l e t us hold i t i n the ent-
rance of the Mech. Eng. Building.
There i s no entrance fee and the
exhibition continues u n t i l the

The paintings are by promi-
sing students who come over
to the Royal College of Art classes.
They are glad of our excellent models
who are prepared to s i t for them
for two hours on Wednesday and
Thursday evenings.
Do you think that i t i s easy
to paint a s i t t e r ? I t i s exciting
to draw the outline of the s i t t e r
f i r s t . To then mix the colours i s
exhilarating. F i n a l l y a likaihess
forms -and one feels elation as
expression gives your painting style
and f i n i s h .
Haider's portrait has a
distinct style, and the drawing i s
good. Yarma's portrait i s an
excellent likeness. Needham's l i f e
painting i s well observed and
composed.
There are others which were
a l l chosen because they have a
quality of v i s i o n . Can you find i t
i n the paintings too?
