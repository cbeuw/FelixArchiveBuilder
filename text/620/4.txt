Hiccups
in the
Union
Sir
It appears that since the new
Exec took office, there have been
several 'hiccups' in the normally
smooth running of the Union,
not to mention a certain amount
of bickering amongst sabbati-
calsj It strikes me, as an observer,
that this is entirely the fault of
our new Hon Sec Miss Freeman.
Having come into the post with
little experience of the higher
(more rarefied) echelons of IC
U n i o n affairs, she has made
several unwarranted assump-
tions about the nature of a
sabbatical's job and about the
general workings of the Union.
She has, very unfairly, assumed
that the object of the Union is to
promote the welfare, and social
life of IC's students. This is not
the case. The object of the Union
is to promote the welfare, and
social life of IC Union's officers.
It is to provide a nice cosy little
office for pompous fools to sit in
whilst they think p o m p o u s
presidential thoughts, whilst
gazing adoring at their own
picture on the wall. (Left-hand
wall, half-way along). It is to
provide storage space for cricket
gear, whilst the acting D P
happily pretends his job consists
of throwing darts at people's
pictures, and the Union Building
falls apart.
She has assumed that a
sabbatical's job is to co-ordinate
and administer the Union, to
work to promote the interests of
IC's students and to represent
their views to College.
Of course this is not so; any
fool can* see that the job of a
sabbatical is to bitch about other
Union officers, to work in one's
own interest (if one has to work
at all) and to represent College's
views as Holy Writ (for further
info ask Opsoc about this).
She has assumed that it is in
the interests of I C U to attempt
to solve problems, disseminate
information and to keep the
wheels turning. It is not. The
interests of I C U are best served
by d r i n k i n g M r s P i n g r e e ' s
sherry, by getting ratted wherever
p o s s i b l e , a n d k e e p i n g the
students as much in the dark as
possible.
It is essential that she be
s t o p p e d before i r r e p a r a b l e
damage is done to the Union's
reputation. With a few more
months of her troublemaking,
who knows? The Union may end
up making a decision in its
members' best interest or, God
forbid, even take action on such
a decision.

is she a woman, she's not in any
of the tie clubs: how can she be
expected to know anything?
It's a
Vet's Life
Dear Martin
In reply to Jon's letter in the
last issue of F E L I X , I must say
that I too was shocked by the
revelation that we have had an
imposter in the Union Office, but
surely it should be future Presi-
dents that are positively vetted?
Yours sincerely

PS: As regards my positive
vetting I believe he has already
intimated elsewhere that this is
definitely not necessary in my
case.
PPS: Why does he not want to
offer his services for the task?
Bloodbath
in
Beruit
Dear Sir, Peace be Upon You,
It is clear from their continued
campaign of genocide against
the civilian population of Beruit
that the Jews have a callous
disregard for human life, except
that is their own! To wit: the
destruction of a block of flats
( 6 / 8 / 8 2 ) in which 250 were
killed—mainly Christian women
and children—or, the demolition
of a mental hospital and lately

Dear Martin
Oh no! Not again!
T h e U n i o n O f f i c e was
thoroughly searched. The box
was not there before the week-
end. Late on Monday afternoon
Mary asked Jen for some boxes.
Jen looked in the corner of the
administrator's office, where
spare boxes are often kept.
Inside this particular box was
Mike.
Admittedly the Union Office
is not as secure as it could be,
but what can you do when the
Dear Martin
Although the letter appeared in
F E L I X three weeks ago, I feel I
must confirm J o n Barnett's
accusation that the so-called
"Nick Morton" does not hold a
birth certificate in that name. I
have documentary evidence to this
effect.
However, I am concerned that
Jon does not wish to offer his
services for positive vetting of
Mary Freeman at regular inter-
vals. When will Jon realise that,
as an officer, one does not offer,
one is mandated? I am sure a
U G M or Council will realise the
benefits of mandating the Welfare
Officer for this task. After all,
who could be more appropriate
when it comes to matters related
to the w e l l - b e i n g of a l l I C
students?

(12/8/82) the 10 hour sustained
blitz, with an as yet unknown
number of fatalities, during a
supposed ceasefire! Yet, if the
Jews were to read their own
Holy Scriptures they would find
that the sanctity of life is stressed
strongly.
The slaughter of innocent
civilians in Beruit is not just a
local disaster but a crime against
the whole of mankind and the
perpetrators of these crimes will
meet just Retribution in the

had the power to stop the

nothing: namely the U S A .

hobby of certain sections of the
student community is collecting
keys and generally entering
places?
We were trying to keep Mike's
re-appearance a secret in an
attempt to discover the "thief s"
identity, but it was decided that
this was not p r a c t i c a l since
security had to be informed so
that they would not be expending
time in fruitless search. Hence
the rumour version—that Mike
had re-appeared somewhere in
the Union Building and that
Christine had found it on her
"rounds".
Please, please in future, do
check to make sure your facts
are straight.

Bar-gains?
Dear martin
I w o u l d like to draw the
a t t e n t i o n of y o u a n d y o u r
readers to the pricing policy of
Southside bar viz. Prices have
been raised for the vacation and
will be reduced again when term
starts. This means that I C
students who remain during the
vacations, mostly P G s , are
discriminated against.
A s s u m i n g that the u n i o n
doesn't implement discrimina-
tory policies for the sake of it, I
can see two possible but unsatis-
factory reasons for this.
It is obviously a good idea to
raise prices to rip off tourists,
but this policy also rips off IC
students. If this is the reason it
should be possible to find a way
round it by having one price for
students and another for tourists.
If there are fewer customers
during the vacation it could be
a r g u e d that each c u s t o m e r
should pay more. It would be
more appropriate for customers
in term and vacation to pay the
same price,-one which would
make the bar viable in the year.
It is ridiculous to calculate
prices in term time on the
assumption that the bar will
dissappear along with all its
overheads when the vacation
comes and then charge a higher
price out of term. Responsibility
for the bars existence out of term
should be shared between all its
c u s t o m e r s and not f o i s t e d
arbitrarily onto one section of
them.
Yours sincerely
