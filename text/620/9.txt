Winning Ways by Elwyn Berlekamp, John
Conway and Richard Guy.
In many ways this is an unnecessary review.
Those of you who read Martin Gardner's
column in Scientific American will already be
familiar with the name of John Conway. Y o u
will already have met his astonishing gift for
using and explaining high-powered maths as if
it were a child's plaything, and you will want
this book. Those of you who do not read
Martin Gardner will not know what I am
talking about, but will not be interested in the
book anyway.
In fact it is actually two books. Volume One
is subtitled 'Games in General' and set up a
formal mathematical system which may be
used to analyse virtually any game which is
susceptible to analysis. The authors begin by
setting up a series of axioms which define a
game, and in the first half of Volume One
('Spade-work') they show how to analyse
games which obey the axioms. 'Change of
Heart' then shows how the analysis can be
modified if some of the axioms are relaxed.
The second volume goes on to show how the
techniques of Volume O n e can be applied to
'Games in Particular' and it too is divided into
t w o s e c t i o n s : ' G a m e s in C l u b s ' w h i c h
c o n c e n t r a t e s on competitive games, a n d
'Solitaire Diamonds' which includes not only a
prodigious range of puzzles including several
which were set as Scaramouche puzzles over
the last two years, but also all kinds of other
mathematical curiosities which didn't fit in
anywhere else.
The mathematics concerned (particularly in
Volume One) is not to be taken lightly. Part of
the reason this review is in the postgrad F E L I X
is that most undergrads will find it rather too
heavy going; not that any specific mathe-
matical knowledge is r e q u i r e d , just that
c u r i o u s c l e a r - h e a d e d p r e c i s i o n w h i c h
mathematicians call mathematical maturity
and everyone else calls pedantry (if they're
being polite). But if this doesn't deter you, the
book is a winner, in more ways than one.
Just to give you a taste of the contents,
some of the more familiar games analysed
include n i m , d o t s - a n d - b o x e s , nine men's
m o r r i s , h e x , g o - m o k u (like noughts and
crosses, but get five in a row on an infinite
board) fox and geese, and (encroaching on my
brother's review) the de Bono L-game. The
puzzles section takes on solitaire, soma, a
great variety of metal puzzles of the type
made popular by Pentangle, all the piano
shifting puzzles ever set in the Scaramouche
column, and a certain puzzle which orginated
in Hungary
A s the maths is rigorous and precise, so is
the style of the book light and informal, almost
to the point of childishness. The author's
determination to illustrate every single point
with a joke, pun, silly drawing or mnemonic is
sometimes very funny, sometimes astonishing
and occasionlly irritating.
M y favourite game in the book is Phutball
and I strongly recommend you to go to a
bookshop and memorise the rules of this
excellent game. Here, though, is the book's
description of Dodgem, a game which has
already fascinated many of the F E L I X staff.

"Colin Vout invented this excellent little game
played with two black cars and two white ones
on a 3 x 3 board, starting as in the diagram. The
players alternately move one of their cars one
square in one of the three permitted directions
(E, N or S for Black; N , E or W for White)
and the first player to get both of his cars oft
the board wins. Black's cars may only leave
the b o a r d across its right-hand edge a n d
White's cars only leave across the top edge.
Only one car is permitted on a square, and you
lose if y o u prevent y o u r o p p o n e n t from
moving."
Winning Ways is published by Academic
Press at £21.60 (ouch!) in paperback or £63 in
hardback. It's in stock at IC Bookshop, and I'll
be recommending it to the Union book buyer.

The L-Game by de Bono Games of
Windsor, £4.95
The L-Game was invented in the mid-sixties by
Edward de Bono; to meet a challenge to
produce a game which has both the simplicity
of noughts and crosses and the strategic skill
of chess.
The area of play consists of a square board
of sixteen squares. Each player has one L-
shaped piece and there are two neutral pieces.
O n each turn, a player must move his L-
piece to a new position, and then may move
one of the neutral pices. Play alternates until
one player has no legal move. This player is the
loser.
V a r i a t i o n s on this theme include Gold
and Silver w h i c h i n v o l v e s f i n d i n g t w o
squares secretly selected by your opponent
whilst he attempted to find yours. Added value
is a similar game in which each player secretly
assigns values to certain squares, and a pre-
determined total has to be reached, a player
scoring points each time his L piece covers the
square his opponent has valued.
I found the game absorbing and entertaining,
the game being as involved and as skilful as the
players want to make it.
Since the game is easy to m a k e from
cardboard, the price of £4.95 seems a little
high. Nevertheless the game is well made from
brightly coloured plastic and heavy duty board
and for those who enjoy the added satisfaction
of playing on a neatly presented set, the game
is excellent value.

PINCCCHIC
A simpler puzzle this issue. I want you to find
the largest number possible using only four
threes. Only powers, multiplication, division,
subtraction and addition can be used (eg 3 to
the power 333 is permissible, but cosh (3333) is
not). If you're not above 10 to the power 100,
you're not really trying. N o need to evaluate
it—just leave it in the four threes form. G o o d
luck everyone!
Solutions, comments and criticisms to me at
the FELIX Office, please. There is a prize of £5
(donated by Mend-a-Bike) for the correct
entry randomly selected at 1:00pm on
Wednesday.
Last Week's Solution
Norman arrived first, then L e n , Michael, Peter
a n d finally O l i v e r . O u t of four c o r r e c t
s o l u t i o n s , P a t r i c k O ' H a r a , D e p a r t m e n t of
Management Science, was the winner of the
£5.
S c a r a m o u c h e t e l l s me t h a t his f i n a l
problems from the last F E L I X of the summer
term are now all solved. Several people solved
'Letters & Figures' and 'Sporting Chance' and
Tim Pigden of M a n Sci and K e n Morison of
C h e m Eng were selected as the respective
winners.
The other two puzzles were each solved by
only one person, so congratulations summa
cum laude to G S Girolami of Chemistry and
Simon Morrow of Maths who solved the chess
puzzle and the furniture shifting respectively.
All of the above four win £10, and all the prizes
will be available for c o l l e c t i o n from the
afternoon of Monday, September 6.
There isn't much point giving the solutions
yet, since they'll only have to be repeated
when the undergrads come back, so I'll keep
you in suspense till then; but if you really can't
stand it, the solution to 'Holding the Baby' is in
Winning Ways, which is reviewed in the games
review elsewhere in this issue.
