beggars. The work is both a great comedy and
a tragedy with great streaks of earthiness and
bawdiness. However, the director, Richard
Eyre, has shifted the scene from the eighteenth
to the nineteenth century. In so doing it
becomes an attack on Victorian hypocrisy in
which the vices of the lower classes faithfully
mirror those of the upper. Right at the
beginning of the play wenchs lay out gas lights
at the foot of the stage as if to put on a show.
THe central irony is then superbly enhanced:
that the rich are patronising an entertainment
that attacks their own values.

I set off this week to visit several different
exhibitions of pictures. Thought I, "different
people get enthusiastic about different things,
so I'll see how broad a spectrum I can cover."
That was the theory but, before you read
further, I'd better let you know I didn't make
it...Why? Well, I started off at the British
M u s e u m , at the exhibition ' A Century of
Modern Drawing', and became enthralled. I
only left when they chucked me out. But I did
manage one extra titbit, on my way back to
College—I'll probably get round to that in the
last paragraph!
The pictures at the British Museum are on
loan from the Museum of Modern Art, New
York; by all accounts one of the greatest
collections of its kind in the w o r l d . T h e
e x h i b i t i o n is set o u t m o r e or l e s s i n
chronological order, starting with drawings by
Seurat and Cezanne from the end of the
nineteenth century. These mark the turning
point from Impressionism and from the idea of
an objective 'truth to nature'. C e z a n n e ' s

colour painted in 1907.
class is portrayed in all its nakedness and
grime, Ga y employs a light heart as a great aid
to survival.
One of two productions of Uncle Vanya by
Chekhov currently on stage in London is at
the Theatre Royal Haymarket. This produc-
tion, directed by C h r i s t o p h e r Fettes, c a n
certainly boast about an all-star cast: Donald
Sinden, Frances de la Tour, Sheila Gish, Bill
Fraser, Ronald Pickup, Margaret Rawlings,
Freda Jackson and Harry Andrews.
The whole play takes place in the 1890s in a
c o u n t r y e s t a t e b e l o n g i n g to P r o f e s s o r
S e r e b r i a k o v ( H a r r y A n d r e w s ) , a r e t i r e d
professor of art. There is little plot as such but
the brillancy of the play lies in its very
perceptive analysis and exploration of human
idleness. Chekhov's had a medical training and
many of his short stories and plays display a
scientific curiosity about details of human
relationships as well as a doctor's compassion
g e o m e t r y " , and from this start the new
movement of Cubism developed. In transferr-
ing a 3-D object onto a two-dimensional piece
of paper, the C u b i s t s produce a sort of
transparent cross-section: the object is split up
into basic geometric shapes which support and
intersect each other. Y o u find yourself looking
at the relation between them, wondering if the
geometric scaffolding is about to fall down and,
as you look, the distinction between the
o r i g i n a l o b j e c t , w h i c h has b e c o m e a n
architectural construction, and the space in
which it is standing, disappears.
A n extra dimension, that of time, is also
introduced: in one picture several different
viewpoints appear together, as if you, the
observer, are not standing still, but walking
r o u n d the object and looking at it from
different angles. Picasso is the name that
springs to mind in this context, and many of
his drawings are on show.
Pushed to its logical conclusion (or to its
incomprehensible extreme, depending on how
you feel about it!) Cubist theory leads to
completely abstract forms. Recognisable
figures and objects are not used, even for
inspiration. The picture is the fruit of the
artist's imagination and expresses a state of
mind or a feeling. The attempt to express the
invisible, intense world of imagination has
produced many weird and some wonderful (?!)
results. F o r example, a collage of freely floating
.pale blue squares! N o line here, just the
tension between the planes and the bare paper
and the edges of the picture. O r a line-, again
c o m p l e t e l y n o n - o b j e c t i v e , w h i c h m o v e s
around so energetically that it leaves black
blobs all over the page. This art avoids, even
rejects, all the visual stimuli of everyday life.
What is the point, other than entertainment?
The only way I can appreciate it and try to
understand it, is by seeing it as a reaction to
materialistic society—I think its message is
that man is not only matter, but is, above all,
mind and feeling.
Not all the drawings, by any means, are
wholly abstract. Many of the artists explore
the connection between imagination and the
real world, and there's a fascinating section of
surrealist art. The surrealists tried to express
the subconscious in visual terms and their
drawings and photo-collages have the same
tinge of irrationality and unreality that colours
a dream or a fairy tale.
Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy it—this
exhibition is an experience, as well as the
cream of a great collection.
A n y b o d y living in the postgrad H a l l in
Montpelier Place? Well, just across the road is
Cheval Place, and at number 25 the Wraxall
Gallery is having a summer exhibition. For
t h o s e of y o u not a c q u a i n t e d w i t h the
backstreets of Knightsbridge, I recommend an
and understanding. Uncle Vanya treads a fine
balance between comedy and tragedy. The
professor's household is as c r o w d e d and
stifling as a small fish bowl. All the characters
represent varying forms of idleness, the laziest
being that of Uncle Vanya (Donald Sinden)
w h o c o m p l a i n s a b o u t the p r o f e s s o r ' s
scribblings on art as "twenty years of nothing".
The professor causes such resentment in the
household, but the irony of course is that the
old man is not idle but busy and hard working
and, most importantly, with a light in the
distance to work towards, even if his work
does add up to little.
Much of the chojcest acting comes from
Ronald Pickup, playing the country doctor
Mikhail Lvovich Astrov. In fact he seems
almost the central character in the play, so
much so that the play ought to be called not
Uncle Vanya but Mikhail Lvovich Astrov! A n
excellent production, it is well worth seeing.

A to Z! Five artists are exhibiting; all, loosely,
inspired by the countryside. The paintings are
in a completely different league from the
drawings at the British Museum, but certainly
worth a visit, and it's interesting to see what

watercolours have little red dots beside them
(NB red dot = red sticky label, approx 1cm in
d i a m e t e r , s t u c k to wall beside p i c t u r e ;
indicates that picture has been sold!). He
paints romantic characters in formal gardens
or symbolic settings, with some delightful
quirks: 'Red Hat' is decorated with cherries;
bright kingfishers hover a n d dart a r o u n d
'Green Hat'. A n n Arnold paints mysterious
corners of English countryside in delicate
pastel colours. Prices range from £30 for
watercolours to almost £3,000 for large oil
paintings I didn't much care for. If anybody's
offering, I'd like Diana Warburton's drawing of
a Racing Pigeon.
