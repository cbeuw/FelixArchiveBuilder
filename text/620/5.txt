Thefts from the Union Building:
Who's really to blame?
Security in a building the size of I C U n i o n is
bound to be a problem, the more so since it
is the responsibility of the Deputy President
to prevent unauthorised access, and full-
time Deputy Presidents are in short supply at
trie moment. Nevertheless, the other U n i o n
officers seem to be taking the matter very
lightly to be able to cheerfully assert that
"...the U n i o n Office is not as secure as it
could be" ( M a r y Freeman and Jen H a r d y -
Smith, Letters). W h y on earth not? The
U n i o n Office houses amongst other things
several electric typewriters, a duplicating
m a c h i n e , a p h o t o c o p i e r , a l l the U n i o n
records, a television set, a cupboard full of
silver trophies (which were stolen two years
ago) and keys to the rest of the U n i o n
B u i l d i n g . S u r e l y w h e n a r o o m h o l d s
property which is so temptingly thievable it
should be made as secure as possible?
M a r y and Jen continue their letter by
asking " W h a t can you do when the hobby of
certain sections of the student community is
c o l l e c t i n g keys a n d g e n e r a l l y e n t e r i n g
places?"
This is rather like asking how the Health
Service can run efficiently when people keep
falling i l l ; a security system exists to stop
p e o p l e e n t e r i n g b u i l d i n g s t h e y a r e n ' t
supposed to, not just to warn them away
from somewhere they aren't allowed to go.
If i n t r u d e r s d o get i n , w h e t h e r serious
burglars or students out for a joke, it shows
the security system is not as tight as it should
be.
In a College such as I C , students are
basically honest, inquisitive and mischievous
and it is part of their nature—a part which
sound scientific training should encourage—
to inquire, investigate and experiment to
f i n d ways r o u n d the p r o b l e m s they set
themselves. If they want to get into a locked
building (and many of them will try) it
should be regarded as a test of the building's
security staff whether they succeed, and not
as s y m p t o m a t i c o f the r e b e l l i o u s a n d
anarchic mentality which M a r y and Jen
seem to suppose.
M u c h of the blame for the lack of security
lies with the ex-Deputy President Barney
M c C a b e . H e made little secret of his hobby
of 'collecting keys and entering places' and
well appreciated the problems of security in
the U n i o n Office. T o this end he invested a
considerable amount of U n i o n money in a
new set of A S S A locks with blanks which
were not easy to copy. H e then fitted these
new locks to most of the doors in the U n i o n
Office. Most? Yes, his typical inefficiency (or
laziness) stopped h i m completing his job,
with the result that students with keys to the
old locks were still able to enter the U n i o n
Office to steal M i k e . N o w , because o f
general laxity, several keys to the new locks
are missing, and security is as bad as ever. In
fact, it is even possible to get into the U n i o n
Office without keys at all if you have the
necessary knowledge, effrontery and luck.
In case you've got the impression that I
condone the breach of security to steal
M i k e — I do! A s I said in my last editorial I
find it very funny that someone had the wit
to h i g h l i g h t the U n i o n ' s f a i l i n g s s o
h u m o r o u s l y , a n d c a n ' t b r i n g m y s e l f to
condemn the theft of an object which exists
s p e c i f i c a l l y as a c h a l l e n g e to p o t e n t i a l
thieves. But I do hope the U n i o n staff make
their office more secure before less frivolous
intruders intrude.
Trying the soft sell
W h e n the idea of moving the U n i o n to
S o u t h s i d e was f i r s t m o o t e d , c a u t i o u s
optimism seemed to be in order. Premises in
S o u t h s i d e are u n d e r u s e d , a n d it is i n
everyone's advantage to have the U n i o n
s i t u a t e d as near to the m a i n H a l l s o f
Residence as possible. Plans had been drawn
u p a f t e r l o n g c o n s u l t a t i o n s w i t h a
responsible U n i o n President, and despite
protests from certain factions who hold a
strong sense of tradition (notably my two
predecessors) it seemed that the U n i o n could
well benefit from such a scheme.
But College's attitude is changing. Right
from the start J o h n Smith has been holding
his cards close to his chest. The move was
proposed last M a r c h , but the plans were not
revealed to the student body until the very
end of M a y , shortly before the end of term
and certainly not allowing enough time for
s u f f i c i e n t debate o n the m a t t e r before
undergraduates went home for the long vac.
It was then revealed that for the move to
take place in September 1983, the U n i o n
would have had to approve the plans by the
end of this coming October, only a few
weeks after undergraduates had reassembled.
C a u t i o n began to harden into suspicion.
N o w the suspicion is turning to distrust.
College is trying a different tack. Plans for
the move have been shelved for the time
being while college offers more facilities i n
Southside; very generous, but we should still
be wary of their motives. In a year or so, if
M r Smith points out to a different Exec that
since we have so many Union activities
based in Southside it might benefit us to
move the whole Union there, it will be as
well to remember the methods that were
tried the first time, and to examine the
options very carefully.
Who's kidding
who?
The centre paragraph of Mary and Jen's
leter has been dealt with above in some
d e t a i l ; l e t us now c o n s i d e r t h e first
paragraph and compare it with the last. The
letter opens by berating F E L I X for factual
inaccuracies in the lead story last issue, and
it cannot be denied that two specific details
m e n t i o n e d , a l t h o u g h trifling and i n c o n -
sequential, were reported wrongly. But how
can the U n i o n have the cheek to criticise
F E L I X for this when two paragraphs later
they admit to spreading deliberate lies on the
same subject? It is the editorial policy of this
newspaper (now, at any rate) to report
events and happenings at IC as truthfully as
possible. But what can you do when the
hobby of certain sections of the Union staff
is s p r e a d i n g r u m o u r s a n d g e n e r a l l y
misinforming people?
F E L I X News
Not quite as many changes as I'd hoped in
this week's F E L I X . The new cover isn't
ready yet (unavoidable technical problems)
and there is no sports news or What's O n
pages. The m a i n change you'll probably
notice is the layout of the letters page; this is
s o m e t h i n g I p r o m i s e d i n my m a n i f e s t o
(those of you who remember it) but didn't
have enough letters for last time. M a k i n g
interesting layout isn't easy with a fixed
amount of material, and so in c o m m o n with
most newspapers, I reserve the right to edit
letters, or even not to print them at a l l i n
exceptional cases, although I'll try to make
sure this only happens rarely. A n d I also
reserve the right not to correct grammar,
spelling or punctuation in letters; if you
want to display your ignorance I'm not
going to stop you.
A special welcome to Peter D a w s o n , our
new printer, and the usual thanks since this
issue w o u l d have been impossible without...
N i c k , N i c k , N i c k , Nick, Steve, Steve, Peter,
Peter, M a r k , Pallab, Dave, Young B o y , M a z
and anyone who turns up to collate. The
next issue will be the Freshers' Issue on
October 4. C o p y deadline is 5:30pm o n
Wednesday September 22. A l l help will be
gladly appreciated on that issue, especially
the m a m m o t h task of collating it which will
take place over the weekend of October 2
and 3.
