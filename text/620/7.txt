Elderly and Infirm
Tadpoles All Set For
Edinburgh
O n T u e s d a y night the College D r a m a t i c
Society staged an open dress rehearsal for two
of the three productions they are presenting at
this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival. O u r
theatre critic Nick Bedding went to investi-
gate
First on the billboard was the What D Y e
Call It by John Gay, a "tragi-comi-pastoral
farce". Directed by the incomparable 'Eric'
Jarvis (why does this guy always have to have
inverted c o m m a s r o u n d his name?) this
excellent choice of play demonstrated the no
small talent present in the company. The
Covent Garden Tragedy (by Henry Fielding)
which will be in repertoire with the What D'Ye
Call It was unfortunately not staged on the
T u e s d a y night. T h a t was rather a pity, I
thought, because I was looking forward to this
play which met with "the universal detestation
of town" on its first night in 1732 (it was
withdrawn after the first night), and had "an
accident ridden first night" when aired 236
years later in 1968.

Next followed The Wire Guided Review
containing no less than twenty sketches. The
first, rather unfunny, sketch took place in what
seemed to be an asylum canteen (if there is
such a place), but the second sketch was
definitely amusing. This was a 'This is Y o u r
Life' show but one in which the guest's most
unpleasant an unsavoury aspects of his life
were chronicled by a sort of ' G o d the Father'
type figure. A bizarre 'father and son' sketch
followed between the versatile Pallab G h o s h
and Duncan Bateson, whose very expressive
face and voice that carries very well is a real
asset to the group. Duncan appeared in the
next sketch where he was transported to the
Land of Infinity to seek fundamental truths and
the M a r i n o Isheep. T h e r e n e x t f o l l o w e d
something perfectly ludicrous: Pope John Paul
II and an assortment of priests, nuns and
monks were boogieing to his words using on
his trip to tnis country (this is the sort of thing
one imagines the Papal team would do after a
particularly hard Papal visit). A policeman
sketch and a party policy game led up to
Ian Forrester, this is your life.
p e r h a p s the best s k e t c h , a lecture by a
professor on his long, rambling and elaborate
thesis about smoking, love-making and cancer,
delivered brilliantly by the talented M i k e
Pickup. A bus-stop sketch led straight on to a
song by 'Eric' Jarvis. Although a talented
guitarist and songwriter he has a voice like a
grief-stricken moose. Dave Wheatley and Mike
Pickup then played two 'arty' intellectuals who
achieved a glorious piece of self-hypocrisy.
Another song followed by the grief-stricken
m o o s e , a n d t h e n a h o r r i f y i n g v i s i o n of
Thatcherism taken to its extreme in a pay
office where Chris Pickup (brother of Mike
Pickup) is told the company has decided not to
pay him that day and instead of groaning he
"ought to be bloody well grateful you've still
got a job". A hilarious sketch by the Dave
W h e a t l e y / M i k e P i c k u p t e a m on t w o
policemen attempting to philosophize gave
way to a sketch involving a very long railing.
Various eccentrics were chaining themselves
to the r a i l i n g : a f a n a t i c a l a d h e r e n t of
O ' F l a n n a g a n ' s m o l e c u l a r t h e o r y , a m a n
concerned about the absence of elderly and
infirm tadpoles, and a member of the S D P .
'Eric' Jarvis then played a vicar at his pulpit
delivering a sermon on the biblical evidence for
Christ's proclivity for the bottle. Territorial
civil servants followed, and then an attack on
the D H S S . The last sketch was different to all
the others: each member of the company
mentioned a current 'injustice' in this country
to w h i c h t h e w h o l e c o m p a n y r e p l i e d
sarcastically "This is British democracy." This
sketch jarred with the spirit of the rest of the
review and should be thrown out. In any case it
was quite incorrect.
The team have certainly succeeded in being
different from the old footlights tradition and
Not the Nine O'Clock News, etc and with
some polishing up of timing and the order of
the s k e t c h e s s h o u l d m a k e a v e r y witty
evening. I wish them luck at the Festival, but
perhaps most importantly, that they have a
good time themselves.
The Winter's Tale by Shakespeare;
The Prince of Homburg by Heinrich
von Kleist; The Beggar's Opera by
John Gay; Uncle Vanya by Chekhov
William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale at
the magnificent new Barbican Theatre is a
romantic tragedy about the vagaries of Time.
Leontes, King of Sicilia (Patrick Stewart)
suspects his wife Hermione (Gemma Jones) of
adultery with their friend King Polixenes of
Bohemia (Rag Jewers). He asks his servant
Camillo (Bernard Lloyd) to poison his friend,
but C a m i l l o is c o n v i n c e d of P o l i x e n e s '
innocence and they flee together to Bohemia.
Leontes has Hermoine imprisoned and casts
their new-born daughter into the wilderness.
A t Hermione's trial the Delphic oracle of
A p o l l o declares that she is innocent a n d
Leontes a tyrant, who will die without an heir if
he does not recover his lost daughter. Almost
immediately their son Hamillius dies, a n d
Hermione collapses in grief, apparently dead.
The abandoned daughter is found and cared
for by a shepherd. Sixteen years pass and
Florizel, Polixenes' son falls in love with her
and decides to marry her despite her humble
origin. They flee with Camillo back to Sicily
where the young girl's true identity is revealed
to L e o n t e s . L e o n t e s a n d P o l i x e n e s are
r e c o n c i l e d , a n d H e r m i o n e is revealed by
Paulina (Sheila Hancock) to be still living.
The Winter's Tale p o s s e s s e s s t r o n g
elements of fantasy and magic but these are
sadly unpronounced in this production by
Ronald Eyre. The stage is for the most part
rather bare and austere, but the odd surprise
does pop up now and then as when Geoffrey
Hutchings emerges as a cockney toast-master
in a morning suit. In the first part of the play
Leontes is in a state of mental turbulence, and
in sudden outbursts voices his 'foul imagin-
ings'. The sufferer is deluded yet half knows he
is under a delusion, but Patrick Stewart's
d e p i c t i o n is c u r i o u s l y u n a n g u i s h e d a n d
unmoving.
Barbican Theatre: a scenefrom the Winter's Tale.
The Prince of Homburg at the Cottlesloe
T h e a t r e , although written in 1811, seems
incredibly modern. Its author, Heinrich von
Kleist, is one of the world's little-known
geniuses.
Entirely without literary training, his eight
stories are each astounding in concept and
miraculous in form. The Prince of Homburg
was his last play and it concerns a young
cavalry officer torn between love and duty.
T h e p r o d u c t i o n by J o h n B u r g e s s at the
Cottesloe is superb; it is strong, sleek and fast
moving, and every sentence and paragraph of
dialogue is laudably concise and perfectly
expressive.
Also at the Cottesloe is The Beggar's Opera
by John Gay. The set, and indeed, the whole
theatre, is highly atmospheric. As soon as one
enters the large black b o x w h i c h is the
Cottesloe, one is confronted with a thick
smokiness through which on the stage one can
discern a large old bridge and beneath it the
musty dark dwelling of the vagrants. This is the
roosting place of beggars, criminals, tramps
and cripples, who would return after a hard
day's work obtaining money by underhand
means.
The play revolves around Macheath (played
by Paul Jones), a pimp playing a highway
