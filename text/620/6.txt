This week FELIX presents a special feature on the forthcoming science fiction epic
Blade Runner, the latest project from Alien director Ridley Scott.
The film is set in the near future and represents a major departure from the current
trend in science fiction movies. It is based on a well known science fiction novel and
has already been heralded as a return to an adult treatment of the subject.
Visually, it may also present a frightening and definitive vision of the city of the
next century.
T h e year is 2020. F o u r rogue a n d r o i d s —
genetically engineered beings w h i c h are
virtually identical to humans—have brutally
murdered a space shuttle crew and inexplicably
returned to earth, where "replicants" are
o u t l a w e d . R i c k D e c k a r d , f o r m e r B l a d e
R u n n e r , is c a l l e d on to r e s u m e his o l d
profession and track down these killers in the
overpopulated and polluted confusion of Los
Angeles.
The Blade Runners of the title are basically
bounty hunters who are trained to detect and
eliminate any replicants found on earth (this is
called 'retirement' rather than murder). The
reason for this is simple: the androids are near
perfect copies of human beings, the only
difference being a built-in four year lifespan
and a lack of emotions. Apart from this they
are of at least equal intelligence and greater
strength and when they realise their peculiar
position in society (one of virtual slavery) they
rebel against their creators with uncontrolable
violence. Hence they are banned on earth and
(being expendable) they are left to spearhead
the dangerous colonisation of outer worlds.
T o add to the inherent dangers, these
particular androids are highly advanced Nexus
6 models, who are believed to be capable of
developing emotions. The Blade Runner's
primary detection tool is the Voight-Kampff
test—a sort of glorified lie detector which
gauges the level of empathic response to a set
of q u e s t o i n s — a n d so partially developed
emotions make detection extremely difficult.
The film is firmly based on Philip K. Dick's
novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,
which is regarded by many science fiction fans
as the definitive android story. It took Rick
Deckard and pitched him against six androids,
Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty
which were essentially flesh and blood human
beings, apart from the fact that they were
genetically engineered rather than born. In the
book he falls in love with one female android
and grows increasingly disillusioned with his
job. It deals, very effectively with man's
response to his own creation which is basically
one of segregation, fear and repulsion.
Hampton Fancher and David Peoples wrote
the screenplay for the film. To adapt the book
for a big screen treatment they have left the
bones of Dick's novel and created an equally
challenging a n d serious film. W h e n D i c k
himself saw the final screenplay he was
reportedly ecstatic, but he tragically died in
February prior to the film's release.
Blade Runner is set in the near future and,
unlike the book, it has an overpopulated city
for its location. The streets teem with life and
the predominantly Asian community fill the
streets in a never-ending stream of noise and
c o n f u s i o n . T h e o p e n i n g s h o t g i v e s a
p a n o r a m i c overview of the polluted city;
massive towers belch enormous flames above
the hundred storey apartment blocks. In the
distance we see two massive pyramids which
disrupt the skyline. T h e s e are the head-
quarters of Tyrell Corporation who create the
replicants for off-world use. The camera slowly
advances to these buildings a n d we see
H o l d e n , another Blade R u n n e r , s c r e e n i n g
workers believed to be replicants who have
infiltrated the organisation. He discovers one,
but not soon enough to save his life.
For this reason Deckard is transported back
to p o l i c e h e a d q u a r t e r s in a s p i n n e r (a
marvellous flying car) and sent after the four
Nexus 6 replicants by his redneck boss Bryant
who refers to the replicants as "skin jobs".
Harrison Ford stars as Deckard and is
formed into a sort of Philip Marlowe character.
Traces of this homage to the film noir style
(typified by The Big Sleep) become more
apparent as the film progresses. F o r d narrates
at several points: "They don't advertise for
killers in the newspapers. That was my job," he
slurs in his opening shot. He is sent to the
Tyrell Corporation to find out more about the
Nexus 6 from its creator, who insists that he
trys the Voight-Kampff test on his assistant
Rachael to see if it works on a human. After
hundreds of questions Deckard finds that she
is a Nexus 6 herself, but in the process he falls
for the beautiful girl.
R a c h a e l , p l a y e d by S e a n Y o u n g , is a
beautifully groomed young lady who is styled
on the Ingrid Bergman/Lauren Bacall heroin.
Doubting the results of her test she persues
Deckard and reveals a series of artificially
implanted memories—she is an experiment for
Tyrell who has not revealed to her that she is
in fact a replicant.
Deckard then sets out to retire the four
rogue androids and the chief protagonist is
introduced. Roy Batty, played by Dutch star
Rutger Hauer, is the leader of the group. He is
a remarkably effective villain, whose bleached
hair a n d distinctive smile are more t h a n
reminiscent of the late Robert Shaw in From
Russia With Love. Hauer gives a gripping

powerful m o m e n t , as the creation meets
creator, is not the climax of the film but it
opens all sorts of questions about the subject
of androids.
The film finishes with Deckard pursueing
Batty and his lover Pris to the apartment of
J . F . S e b a s t i a n , one of T y r e l l ' s g e n e t i c
engineers. This is a marvellous set full of eerie
androids which Sebastian has built as friends.
The apartment is located in The Bradbury
Building, another obvious homage as the set is
lifted from the classic Outer Limits episode
The Fiend with the Glass Hand (written by
Ray Bradbury).
In the half light of this building, Deckard as
the hunter becomes hunted in a stunning
climactic chase which displays Rutger Hauer's
talent to the full.
The outstanding star of the film is stillthe
city itself though, which was created by a team

of highly talented people. The basic design
work was greatly influenced by Syd Mead, who
is described as a "futurist". This has nothing to
do with a taste for strange music but is more
concerned with his work designing highly
stylised vehicles for large motor companies.
Ridley Scott was not put off by the salary Mead
demanded ($1150 per day) and commisioned
him to design a convincing spinner flying car.
Mead read the script and naturally added
b a c k g r o u n d s to c o m p l e m e n t his designs.
These impressed Scott so much that he kept
Mead employed for eighteen months on all
aspects of the film's design.
The result is what Mead calls a "retrofitted"
look; he envisioned a world where existing
items were rarely replaced, but improved and
added to. This resulted in cars with all sorts of
odd extras attached. More importantly the old
replicant. The room is full of harmless genetic
t. It has a wonderful fairy tale look, but soon
buildings at ground level were kept and merely
built on top of, using advanced lightweight
materials. This resulted in the hundred storey
apartment buildings which tower above the
older streets.
Ridley Scott drew many of the street designs
himself (he studied at the Royal College of Art)
and he took complete , almost obsessive
control of the whole project. This ranged from
supervising the effects and set construction to
filming and editing.
A s a director Scott's main fault is that he
puts little depth into his characters. This was
far more apparent in Alien, but w o r k e d
surprisingly well in The Duellists. Here it works
reasonably well a n d , although the Philip
Marlowe narration is a little cliched, it does add
depth to Deckard's character. The replicants
are understandably enigmatic (after all they
are supposed to be emotionless) but the film
still lacks totally convincing characters.
One thing that is thoroughly convincing is
the s p e c i a l p h o t o g r a p h i c effects w o r k ,
s u p e r v i s e d by the long standing team of
Douglas Trumbull and Matthew Yurichich.
They have an impressive list of credits ranging
from 2001: A Space Odyssey and Silent
Running to Close Encounters. Trumbull was
particularly pleased that this was not just
another space film with lots of pretty star fields
and he rose to the challenge of producing a set
of interesting effects e c o n o m i c a l l y . Ridley
Scott insisted on a particular integrated look
for the film and Trumbull hired a team of
technicians who provided just that.
Scott required a murky, smokey look for the
city itself. For the opening shot a marvellous
cityscape was created (called Hades by the
crew) which was filmed through vaporised
diesel oil to give the heavily polluted feel
immediately. It is difficult to believe that the
model used was between four and eighteen
inches tall and that the Tyrell pyramids were a
mere five feet high.
T h e m o d e l s p i n n e r f l y i n g c a r s w e r e
extremely good, but unfortunately the full size
version was not integrated well with the effects
work. Even the continuous (and unexplained)
rain in the city could not hide the obvious wires
used to lift the full size spinners on take-off. A s
the spinners were the main link between the
street and aerial scenes this is a great pity.
Ridley Scott himself despises the t e r m
"effects film", as he rightly insists that special
effects should not be used just to prop up a
weak story. In Blade Runner he knew what he
wanted from the effects; the dark and smokey
look is deliberate as well as the flare and haloes
a r o u n d light s o u r c e s ( w h i c h m a k e s the
spinners look remarkebly like some of the
(JFOs in Close Encounters). These were then
successfully blended with the live action and
never dominate the film.
For me the film had a few stumbling blocks
which seemed odd, while not detracting from
the overall enjoyment. For instance, it was
easy to accept the leaps in the story which
bring the characters together but some of the
basic premises seemed a little shakey. For a
start it is doubtful that genetic engineering will
advance sufficiently to produce such perfect
androids by 2020, less than forty years hence.
It therefore seemed pointless to fix a date in
the first place, as we could have managed
perfectly well without. Admittedly Dick himself
set the novel in 1992 (nobody's perfect) but he
included a fairly plausible colony on Mars. The
film goes much further in suggesting populated
star systems which is highly unlikely by 2020.
Considering that the film is aimed at an adult
audience, the "near future" treatment seems
inappropriate when it demands such a striking
suspension of belief. After all, good fiction
tends to be based on reasonably believeable
projections of the present, so why not avoid
any obvious pitfalls if you can?
Perhaps the most pleasing aspect of the
whole film is the honesty with which the main
character is dealt with. Those who go along
after hearing Harrison Ford's name expecting
Indiana Jones vs The Androids will be
disappointed, as Deckard spends most of the
time being beaten up by his physically superior
adversaries. He develops into a quiet and
fallible anti-hero which suits the general feeling
of the novel very well. Scott has avoided falling
into the trap of glamorizing his hero, which is a
brave step considering the current trend in
films.
A l t o g h e t h e r then, Blade Runner is an
impressive achievement which succeeds on
Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, Blade
Runner (a policeman whose job is to "retire"
any replicants found on earth). During his
pursuit of four Nexus 6 androids he begins to
sympathise with these strange creatures.
many levels. It is both entertaining and serious
and is presented with great visual style. The
story itself may not be to everyone's taste, but
it is transferred to the screen in a convincing
manner which befits a film which may herald
the return of serious science fiction as a genre.
It is certainly more entertaining than the batch
of shoot 'em up laser battles which have
followed Star Wars and deserves a large
audience with both confirmed sf and non sf
fans alike.
Blade Runner opens on September 9 at
the Warner West End.
Short Notice
J o h n M i l i u s ' Conan the Barbarian is
released next week and attempts to transfer
Robert E. Howard's famous character to the
screen (using Austrian muscleman Arnold
Schwarzenegger in the title role).
Before any of you waste good money going
to see this film, I should warn you that it is one
of the biggest turkeys in years. There are few
films I would walk out on, but this is one.
Milius not only wastes a reasonable story,
but also throws away a promising villain in
James Earl Jones (who supplies the voice for
Darth Vader). Most of the dialogue is stunted
or n o n s e n s i c a l a n d e v e n an i m p r e s s i v e
mechanical snake is thrown away.
Avoid this one like the plague.
