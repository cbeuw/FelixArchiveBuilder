Prints Charming
Peter Dawson has joined the
F E L I X staff as a replacement
for printer Ian Morse.
Ian left the Union after eight
years service to become a full-
time musician.
Kneecapped
Ken, the popular Beit security
guard suffered a serious motor-
cycle accident last month when a
car pulled out in front of him. As
a result of this he has had to
have part of one kneecap
removed.
The F E L I X staff would like to
offer Ken their sympathy, and
hope that he will be back on his
feet again soon.
N e w ties for old
A new design has been produced
for the I C U Social Colours tie
because in the opinion of various
suitably qualified persons, the
old tie was absolutely disgusting.
The pattern of the re-vamped
attire is a repeated series of
stripes in silver (V2 "), gold ('/8 ")
and navy blue ('/2 ").
As usual it may be purchased
from the Southside Shop by
suitably qualified persons.
The new printer, happy in his work.

C a p t a i n hangs on
College block yesterday denied
that Captain Lindley is to retire
earlier than was o r i g i n a l l y
expected. A popular rumour has
been spreading in both the
Union and Sherfield Building to
the effect that the Captain will
retire before December 31, but
official sources reaffirmed that
he has no intention of retiring
until then.
The U n i o n Office was left
without lighting for several days
last week when an electrician
working in the Lower Lounge
drilled through a mains cable in
an underground duct. Because
of the proper earth connection
the man was not hurt.
College maintenance were
called and immediately made
sure there was no possibility of
further danger resulting; this
i n v o l v e d d i s c o n n e c t i n g the
power from a large part of the
Union Building including the
Union Office, the Concert Hall
and the Dramsoc Storeroom.
D r a m s o c were p a r t i c u l a r l y
concerned, since they had a full
dress rehearsal for their Edin-
burgh Fringe shows planned for
Tuesday evening. They made
arrangements for an alternative
power source, but it was not
necessary to use it since the cable
was repaired on Tuesday morn-
ing.
Alf Toft, the surveyor res-
ponsible for the Union Building,
expressed great surprise that a
cable should ever have been laid»
in the duct, since there are many
more suitable places for it to
pass. It was impossible to check
its position beforehand since the
plans, which date from the time
when the Union Building was
built, have been lost.

Tourists Mugged in Southside
The latest move in marketing IC regalia has already reached the
Southside Shop and will soon be followed by glasses, also engraved with
the IC coat of arms and motto.
The mugs, which sellfor 80p, are very popular with the tourists who
stay in the Southside Halls. Trade has fallen off slightly now the
tourists are leaving, but at the peak of the season they were "selling like
hot cakes" according to staff in the shop.
