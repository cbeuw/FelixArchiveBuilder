Elizabeth is a patron. His selection, subject to medical
examination, was approved by the special comndttee wblsli
includes Dr. Vivian Fuchs, Leader of the Expedition.
•'Steve* graduated at the University of Queensland, where
he tool: honours in Geology. This course of study led 1dm
to a. life of open air adventure, sometimes in little known
bush country of Qusensland. Ha beoame President of the Univ-
ersity of xhieensland Bush Walking Club, a select society
whose activities included anything fran "knocking off" vir-
gin peaks to quiet rambles throupfr the bush - a society
that has produced more than one Antarctic explorer.
He was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Soienoe Research Schol-
arship and cams to I.C. in October 1954. He immediately
'BSde !iis presence felt in the Mountaineering Club, where
he now iiolds the office of Vioe-Eresidant. It was mainly
due to liis hard work and efficient organising that a party
from I.C.M.C. visited the Alps this Sumner. Steve spent
five weeks climbing in the Alps where he gained much useful
experience and mode 3oma fine guideless climbs.
Steve joined the Boat Club and rowed in the RiC.S.Lowry
crew and won both the I.C. Novioes and Junior Soul Ting
Championships. He is President of the Overseas Students
Club, and also 3it3 on the Library Committee. He helped
in the formation of the I.C.Explaration Board and is keen
for a successful outcome of this venture.
The story of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition is quiokly
becoming household conversation. Muoh has already been
written by the TIMES who hold the World. Copyright. The
BBC have oovered the plans of the Expedition in a series
of programmes. Steve will be sailing out to Antarctica
next November with the main party. There they will be
based in Vahsel Bay an the Woddell Sea far twelve months
training and soientlfio observation. Much of this work
will be carried out at sUb-zero temperatures.
The start far the Pole w i l l be i n November 1957, and
Steve has high hopes of being a member of the small group
that hopes to make the 2000 mile crossing acros3 the
icy wastes to meet Hillary's party whioh will set out
iYom Mcttavlo Sound on the opposite side of the Continent.
W
e are extremely proud to have an I.C. man take part in
what will be one of the most arduous and ambitious exped-
itions of the century. W
e offer him our congratulations
and best wishes in his future adventures.

A delightful l i t t l e booklet, whioh no I,C. student should
be without, has just been published. It's title? "The Future
of Imperial College" - by R.P. Linstead. The booklet is a reprijrt
of the Rector's inaugural Address, held a short while ago in
the Royal Geographical Society's Lecture Theatre, and i t is
printed legibly upon white paper. One will notice that there
are a few bl:.nk pages towards the end : these are for any poss-
ible notes or memoranda whioh the reader may care to make.
The author shows great farsight throughout the booklet,
and in one oase he thinks i t probable that the newly-formed
Exploration Board will take part in a scientific expedition
to the Himalayas. We hope that a l l students will read this
interesting l i t t l e pamphlet, because i t concerns their fut-
ure, and the future of their grandchildren. W
e also trust
that the "Times Educational Supplement" will 3ee f i t to review
the true facts of the expansion of Imperial College, with all
its implications.
