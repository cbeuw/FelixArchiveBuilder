Since the crushing defeat of King's College
in the f i r s t round of the U.L. Cup, the l e t . XT
appears to have l o s t a l i t t l e of i t s f i r * , b u t ,
nevertheless, continues to play good rugby ana
has noticeably improved I t s defence ee that i n the
last three Batches I.C. has not conceded a point.
iVgalnst University College at Shenley, the
scene of past disasters, I.C. took some time to
s e t t l e .own, and i n the f i r s t half with the excep-
tion of one or two s o l i t a r y breaks neither side
looked l i k e scoring. In the second h a l f , however,
a persistent onslaught on the U.C. l i n e was main-
tained and tn'y the excellent s p o i l i n g of the
onposition wingforwards prevented the scoring of
t r i e s . After an attempted dropped goal by Holman
that struck the crossbar and a dive over the U.C.
line in the corner by Reynolds who was held by the
referee to be i n touch the match was clinched by a
penalty goal kicked by Hearn, The great reserve
strength of T.C. compared with other colleges was
emphasised by the 2nd. X V s deoisiwe win.
The following Saturday the 1st.,2nd. and "A"
XVs entertained London Welsh at Harlington, a
f i x t u r e that i s looked forward to with enthusiasm
by mahy stalwarts of the club. The 1st, XV match
was noteworthy f o r the better t a c k l i n g of the I.C.
backs. On the few occasions on which the b a l l was
allowed down on * l i n e there appeared, however, a
lack of thrust and scoring chances i n the f i r s t half
were few. The forwards procured more of the b a l l
in the second half and the previously scrappy l i n e -
mt play was tightened up to some degree. Same
unfortunate attempts at goal from penalties and
a narrowiy missed dropped kick a* goal were followed
by a t r y from Whitmore who scrambled home a f t e r
gathering a bouncing b a l l from a high free kick.
The t r y was converted into a j o a l by a f i n e kick
by Hearn.
The f u l l repercussions of the l i v e l y evening
in the bar afterwards are not yet known, but per-
haps f o r the f i r s t time the College outnumbered
the "Welsh" whose singing, s p i r i t e d though i t was
did not come up to t h e i r usual high standard.

Last Vednesday afternoon, Imperial
College beat the Royal Veterinery College
convincingly i n the second round of the
University rugger cup. It was not u n t i l they
had established a 14-0 lead that they played
t h e i r best, and i t i s hoped that they w i l l
be inspired by t h e i r victory to s e t t l e down
more luickly i n the next matches.
Outstanding in the game were the wing
forwards, Whitmorc and Jones, Doncaster as
inside threequarter. and Lewis who played
excellently as f u l l back i n the seeond h a l f .
The few occasions when the I.C,line was
threatened, excellent defence soon took the
b a l l to the other end of the f i e l d , completely
demoralising the Vets, atteck
