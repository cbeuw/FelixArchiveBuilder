Last Saturday night I.C.W.A.held an Informal
Dance i n the Ayrton H a l l . The hand f u l l f i l l e d i t s
function adequately enough, althoough tne trumpeter
showed a certain lack of stamina towards the end,
but, as on many previous occasions, the f l o o r was
far too crowded f o r dancing i n reasonable comfort.
There are only two solutions to the problem
of overcrowding, apart from r a i s i n g the price of
admission which of course, the Union would r i g h t l y
forbid having only last year fixed the present max-
imum charges.
The f i r s t of these solution i s to s t i l l f u r t e r
reduce the number of t i c k e t s available, this number
being f a r too small even now. One must strongly
disapprove such a drastic step. Moreover, the a l l -
imnortant takings would decline as a r e s u l t .
In view of these unsatisfactory alternatives
the Union must direct i t s energies i n the direction
of obtaining a larger h a l l or h a l l s i n which to hold
i t s functions.
Last session dances were held i n the Imperial
Institute and i n Queen Alexandra's House, of which
the l a t t e r was the more pleasant venue. Many aim
students w i l l r e c a l l with pleasure the Jazz Dance
held i n Q.A. at which the TUrmingham University
Jazz Club helped to provide entertainment.
It i s to be hoped that some s i m i l a r solution
to the problem w i l l be f>und this year by Union
Entertainments Committee-in time f o r the Easter
t?rm.

MACHINES HIRED WEEKLY OR MONTHLY
R E P O R T : T i m e and Motion Study
Location: The 'Proms'.
General"Remarke: - Positioning poor; orchestras could
be accomodated i n smaller space i f seated i n para-
l l e l linee inetead of ragged semicircles. Dress of
operatora extravagant; ordinary c i v i l i a n clothing
would be p e r f e c t l y adequate f o r a l l but a Royal Per-
formance.
Subject: - Programme devoted to works at least f i f t y
years old; management should experiment with newer '
material, ,
Efficiency: - (a) of manpower: Unnecessary dupitic-
ation by v i o l i n s a l l playing i d e n t i c a l notes; staff
of t h i s section should be d r a s t i c a l l y cut and a lar-
ger volume of sound obtained by means of electronic
apparatus. Many wind and percussion instruments are
unused f o r considerable periods; t h e i r work should
be spread more evenly over the concert, thus elimino
ating peaks of a c t i v i t y . This would make possible a
further saving i n manpower.
(b) of time: No useful purpose served
by repeating on the horns a passage already handled
by the strings. This type of situation occurs a l l
too frequently. The scores should be d r a s t i c a l l y
pruned i n order to eliminate a l l such redundant pas-
sages. Furthermore, there i s no need f o r an inter-
val as l i g h t refreshment might well be obtained dur-
ing the periods set aside f o r applause.
(c) of operators: Only the p i a n i s t
makes f u l l use of both hands and feet. Many operat*
ors not only have both feet i d l e , but are using one
hand to hold t h e i r instrument. A f i x t u r e should be
provided i n such cases, and the p o s s i b i l i t y of i n -
creasing the proportion of pianos investigated.
(d) of the foreman: The foreman's
s t i c k i s f a r too short and flimsy to be an effective
stimulant, and any effect i t would have i s lost
through i t being constantly i n view. Slackers would
be more easily detected were the foreman to stand
behind the orchestra. I t would also keep .the operat-
ors more on t h e i r toes when he did appear.
jBecommendatibns? - ( i ) That Prince L i t t l e r , S i r Henr

modern conditions.

, PORTRAIT OF A NUISANCE
A l l sorts of people go to make .
A College l i k e I.C.,
And some of them w i l l always wake
A wrathful urge i n me.
"You cannot mistake him because of the smell.
When he's within 500 yards you can t e l l .
But he often w i l l give out a warning appeal
Like a death k n e l l - when tapping i t out on
his heel.
In argument, h i s reputation i s high.
When beaten, h e ' l l give you a jab i n the eye
Or induce mild hypnosis with fast baton stroke
And depart quite triumphant enveloped i n smoke.
He's a menace to peace, you a l l know the type,
Oh readers, beware of the Man with a Pipel"
Watta Wordsworth.
