I.C.CC.C. BEAT SHEFFIELD
Overwhelming Victory
In what was undoubtably our best match of the sea-
son to date, the Croes Country Club heavily defeat
ed Sheffield University and Leicester University
College at Sheffield last Saturday. The five-mile
course o'er h i l l and dale (mainly h i l l ) was the
same as last year, when Sheffield beat us.
The pace was very fast throughout, some of
us knocking two minutes o f f last year's time. There
is no doubt that we would have scored an even more
resounding victory, were i t not f o r the team's av-
ersion to farmyard animals with horns, which caus-
ed a number of detours. However, no-one was impal-
ed, although Dearden lost h i s shorts temporarily
on a barbed-wire fence, and we finished with our
six scoring men in the f i r s t eight home.
The Leicester men did not put i n an appearance
u n t i l a l l the I.C. runners were i n . Our scoring
team was C o t t e r i l l (2nd), Barber (4th), Webster(5)
Ansell (his best run f o r years - 6th), Rogers(7th)
and Wood (8th).
The best was s t i l l to come. The victorious
team headed back to town with the proverbial t i n
of red paint, which was l i b e r a l l y applied.
The less said of t h i s side of the a f f a i r the
better, but i t i s a fact that S-nd-rs-n had to be
f o r c i b l y restrained from performing breakneck
c a l l i s t h e n i c s i n a railway carriage.
W i n t e r Championships
'in Wednesday Nov. 16th. a team of Athletes, hurrie-
dly selected as a result of the 14 days notice given
by the University authorities, competed i n the l i r a t
winter Field Kvents and Relays Championships to be
held f o r f i f t y years at Motspur Park.
In the F i e l d Events, teams of two competitors
were entered f o r each event and t h e i r aggregate
distance, thrown or jumped, was the basis of the
points awarded.
ureat praise must be given to the small team
of eight who completed i n the seven events and
whose s t e r l i n g performances under adverse conditions
gave them overall f i r s t place with 25 points.

Tn the three Relay races, those of 4 110 yds.
220 440 220and 880 1 mile 880, the fortunee of I.C.
were rather mixed.
The Sprint Relay team of Reran, Hobson, Mac-
kenzie and Hooper ran 4th i n t h e i r heat and were
thus eliminated. The other sprint team were scrat-
ched whilst the 2-mile «edley team of H.Pincent,
J.Evans and L.Locke had a runaway v i c t o r y by over
100 yds. from a rather t i r e d U.C. team.
It i s hoped that meetings of t h i s type can
be held at more frequent dates throughout tJM
winter to keep University athletee i n racing f i t -
ness f o r next seasons programme.
H O C K E Y
Since the last report in Felix, the fortunes of the
Club have been varied. The 1st. XI lost narrowly to Hendon,
and to St. Catherine's College, Cambridge, in the return fix-
ture. However, a resounding 9-1 victory was recorded against
iheArr\y(London District). F.CM.Sillett and Hashim Khan have
now Joined the side and should do much to inarease our chanoes
in the seoond round of the U.L. Cup, against U.C. next Wed-
nesday. J.I—Tayler continues to be the leading goal-scorer.
The second and third elevens have not yet played acc-
ording to expectations. It has been suggested that some play-
ers might benefit from a rigorous early morning training pro-
gramme.
With the cooperation of I.C.W.S.C. the mixed XI i s
both popular and successful, having so far won two matches
and lost one.

Gordon Halsey,(R.S.K.) in stripes, boxing Hayes (rings).
On Thursday, Nov. 17th. the College,renresenteri
by :orbett, Baker , McKenzie, Moorhouse, Shepherd,
Halsey and the captain, Palmer, competed in the
University t r i a l s . The competition was organised
according to A.B.A. weight groups. The f i n a l res-
ult was:I.C. 22 points; Kings 11; and London Hosp-
i t a l 8.
Palmer won the featherweight d i v i s i o n on a
walk-over. In the light-welterweights, Shepherd,
boxing against Wood of Westminster College, an
orthodox boxer with a good l e f t hand, managed, by
his tenacity and superior punching-to f l o o r his
opponent twice before the contest was caller! to
a halt with Wood on the f l o o r i n the second round,
G. Walsey meeting Hayes of King's, who had
previous'y displayed his tough c a p a b i l i t i e s by
beating Kelly (London Hospital) i n an elimination
bout e a r l i e r on, t r i e d very hard.(proving such
tough opposition indeed, that Hayes who eventually
won on points decided to withdraw from the compe-
t i t i o n and so made Shepherd the winner) and showed
considerable talent with a long straight l e f t whioh
scored many times but through attempting to use a
right hand at the wrong time l e f t himself wide
open to Hayes3
very accurate l e f t s .
Welterweight- H. McKenzie i n a very weak state
through weight trouble put up a good showing against
Whitfield of St. Georges (a previous London Team
Boxer) but was too slow and was usually beaten to
the punch by h i s very cool opponent who won on
points.
Whitfield went on ten minutes later to beat
a very plucky Imperial man, Moorehouse, who
carried the f i g h t to his man f o r much of the bout
although taking considerable punishment.
In the semi-final at the l i g h t heavyweight
d i v i s i o n two Imperial men, Corbett and Baker,
passed through three rounds of very orthodox
boxing i n which Baker through a stronger l e f t hand
and safer defence won on points. The other semi-
f i n a l winner withdrew and Baker was deelau-ed the
winner.

St. Catherine's and Queen's College were defeated
and a v i s i t to St. Edmund H a l l , Oxford, where
the team, shewed great s k i l l . a n d s p i r i t i n beating
