Accommodation For Students Already At T h e University
Session 1976/77
1. Single students requiring accommodation
a) room plus breakfast with/without other meals,
single or shared
b) room with cooking facilities, single or shared (for
flats see 2 below)
should apply by appointment to the appropriate branch of
the Accommodation Office between mid-May and the end of
term, preferably when they have a few free days in order to
look at addresses. An address can then be reserved
provisionally, no retaining fee is payable over the summer
for bookings made at this time, but a deposit may be
required.
After the end of term priority for these types of accommodation
is given to students who will be new to London in October.
2. Single students requiring a flat for two or more people (ie
one room plus) own kitchen, or larger)
may enquire from mid-May onwards whether any offers of this
type have been made for October but, with only a few
exceptions, it is not possible to book flats in advance
(unless full rent is to be paid throughout the vacation).
Therefore it is generally fruitless to begin the search until
about three weeks before the first rent payment can be made,
and the earlier in the summer this can be the better.
3. Married students should apply by appointment (to the
Malet Street Office), about three weeks before the first
rent payment can be made and the earlier in the summer this
can be the better.
A S T H E M O R E observant of
you w i l l have noticed, a new
s o c i e t y h a s recently been
formed, the Imperial C o l l e g e
Debating Society. Some of us
with cultural and oratorical
leanings had noticed the
serious lack of regular
debate within the C o l l e g e ,
and have gone
trouble to remedy
d e f i c i e n c y .
Our introductory
took place at the end
term, attended by many
interested persons. After
completing the tedious details
of deciding on our constitution
and electing a full complement
of committee members, there
was much d i s c u s s i o n about
future meetnigs. Our aim is to
involve throughout the C o l l e g e ,
both students and staff in
thought-provoking d i s c u s s i o n .
to some
this sad
meeting
of last
The level of debate w i l l be
maintained between that of a
serious ICU political debate
and the more light-hearted
d i s c u s s i o n s to be found at
C C U meetings. A s an e n -
couragement to prospective
members, we already have
two cups to be w o n : a
fresher's c u p , and a trophy
for debate between the
three constituent college
unions.
The first meeting of the
society will take place
around the third week of this
term, the motion under debate
being: "This house believes
an Arts faculty would lower
the standard of excellence at
Imperial College". A H
interested parties should
attend this meeting, details
of which w i l l be advertised
throughout C o l l e g e .
Have you bought any faulty goods lately? Having trouble
with the landlord? H a d a car accident? G o t to appear in
court?
