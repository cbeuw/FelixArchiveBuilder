A Taxing
T H E S T A N D A R D system of
personal taxation- in this
cou/itry is the " P a y A s Y o u
E a r n " , ( P A Y E ) system which
operates a s follows:-
Each Taxpayer is allowed
to earn a certain amount of
money free of tax each year,
and only pays tax on what he
earns over this amount. T h i s
amount c a l l e d your ' a l l o w a n c e ' ,
varies from person to person
and is dependant on personal
circumstances (marital status,
no. of children etc). F o r
example, the allowance for a
single person is currently
£675 pa (soon to be more,
T U C willing).
T h i s allowance is split
equally over the weeks o' the
year (tax year, that is) so that
each week you w i l l have 1/52
of your allowance as free-pay,
that is, not taxed. The weeks
of the tax year are numbered
from 1 to 52 (5th A p r i l onwards)
and the system operates
cumulatively. The tax paid in
any week is calculated in the
following way:-
Problem?
1. F i n d total pay to date
(inc. this week) for current
tax year.
2. F i n d total tax paid to date
for current tax year.
3. F i n d free-pay to date
(allowance/52 x tax week no.)
Tax this week -
(1 - 3) x 35%) - 2
tax-rate - 35%
T h i s is fine if you happen
to be in full-time employment.
It becomes much more
complicated if you are a
student — you w i l l only be
working a few weeks in the
year. Consider a single
student, working over the
Easter recess, earning £40pw
and returning to c o l l e g e on
26th A p r i l .
Rather than (sic) mess
about like this the Taxman
has arranged a s p e c i a l
concession for students
whereby they sign an under-
taking not to earn more than
their allowance in the tax-
year and he does not keep on
taking it away with one hand
and giving it back with the
other.
T h i s does not mean that
students are exempt from
paying Income Tax (a popular
misconception). They are just
as liable;they just do not earn
as much as non-students.
At all times your tax
position is personal to y o u .
Your parents do not affect the
amount of tax you have to
pay although, if you are an
undergrad, you w i l l affect the
amount your parents pay - If
they are claiming a c h i l d
allowance for supporting you,
this w i l l be varied according
to how much you earn
(obviously, the more you
earn the less your parents need
to keep you).
