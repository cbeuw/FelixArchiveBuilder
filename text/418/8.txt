M A R K C A L D W E L L previews a new
World War 1 epic drama " A C E S H I G H "
which has its world premiere on May 17th
Good take-off,
faultless landing
Quote from publicity handout — "Aces
High is a story about love and comrad-
ship, loneliness and death. It if about
action and adventure, and the bravery of
man."
Do you groan inwardly? Never mind.
T h i s film i s recommended. A qualified
recommendation though. If you regard the
F i r s t World War as an historical nicety
which inflicted timely punishment upon
greedy c a p i t a l i s t nations, are bored by
aeroplanes and look upon acts of heroism
merely as manifestations of misguided
jingoistic fervour, then may be this
film is not for you.
F r a n c e , 1917. T h e film follows the
trials and adventures of a newly arrived
officer Croft, stationed at a front line
squadron of the R o y a l F l y i n g Corps.
Accounts of life on the Western Front
are w e l l known and the film bares many
of the hallmarks of the experiences of
newly commissioned officers described
elsewhere. F o r instance, the c o l d
reception at the mess on first arriving —
"Hullo I'm Croft"
"Are you"
"You're not flying today"
"So it would appear".
A l s o , fraternizing with the men and
eating their bread and cheese, following
the death of a fellow officer during a
m i s s i o n and the subsequent rebuke for
avoiding h i s fellow officers. Peter F i r t h
of " E q u u s " fame plays the part with
s k i l l . During a v i s i t to a nightclub in
Rouen, he conveys C r o f t ' s sense of
embarrassment and isolation s o con-
v i n c i n g l y that at times one almost shares
h i s unease.
' A C E S HIGH' Directed by J a c k
Gold: Starring Malcolm McDowell,
Christopher Plummer. Simon Ward,
Peter Firth'. Screenplay by Howard
Barker, inspired by R C Sherriff's
play " J o u r n e y ' s F n d " ' .
Major Gresham (Malcolm McDowell)
commands the squadron with expected
B r i t i s h sang-froid. N o n e t h e l e s s , he
never takes off sober and in a rare
moment reveals h i s sense of utter terror
to a fellow officer Crawford.
T h i s i s the first time Malcolm
M c D o w e l l h a s been able to use h i s
considerable talents i n a serious adult
role. He handles the two sides of
Gresham's character adroitly. Crawford,
turned litteraly crazy with fear so' ,hat
he refuses to f l y , is played by Simon
Ward. However, there i s only one
d i s p l a y e d outburst of madness and
mercifully it i s performed with restraint.
Christopher Plummer (the " S o u n d of
M u s i c " man) plays a veteran affection-
ately known as ' U n c l e ' . T h i s sort of
paternalistic character could e a s i l y
have become embalmed with s i c k l y
sentiment. Thankfully this doesn't
happen and the paternalism i s controlled.
Jack Gold keeps h i s cast on a tight
rein. Notable guest appearances are
made by Sir John G i e l g u d , Trevor
Howard, R i c h a r d Johnson and R a y
M i l l a n d . T h e cast a l s o includes one of
Malcolm M c D o w e l l ' s fellow rebels from
'If..', D a v i d Wood.
Indeed my only c r i t i c i s m of the film
is the preponderance of exuberant
Malcolm McDowell
public school bonhommie which permeates
some of the film's lighter moments
almost to the point of nausea. However,
remembering that this is a period film, it
could be argued that an accurate
portrayal demands that the acting should
be flavoured with the Zeitgeist of the
era in question.
I nearly f o r g o t to mention the
aeroplanes. P o s s i b l y because although
there are technically brilliant and
spectacular in flight, once on the
ground, they remain throught the film, a s
they should be, well proportioned props.
Watergat
" A l l T h e President's M e n " (Warner
Bros, A ) directed by Alan Pakula;
starring Robert Redford and Dustin
Hoffman.
" T H I S IS N O T a film about N i x o n " s a y s
Robert Redford whose brainchild the
Jilm w a s and who w a s one of the prime
architects of the film. H e and Dustin
Hoffman play the parts of the two
Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward
and Carl Bernstein respectively, assigned
to cover the Watergate building break i n .
When powerhouse attorneys show up
at the hearing to determine whether bail
w i l l be granted, Woodward i s curious.
H i s curiosity is further aroused when one
of the burglars admits to being an e x -
CIA man.
T h i s is when the tek to the P r e s i d e n t ' s
office really begins.. N o one really
believes any more, at the Post at least,
that the break in w a s the work of crazy
C u b a n s . Woodward and Bernstein follow
>how it was
up countless leads in their investigations
which have a habit of revealing facts
that an F B I investigation covering 1500
people d o not.
A s in a l l good detective films there
has to be an "informant ". In this c a s e
it i s Deep Throat played by Hal Holbrock.
Deep Throat w a s Woodward's contact
who had a c c e s s to information at the
White House. In newspaper, parlance,
Deep Throat, w a s used only for " d e e p
background". H e w a s used by Woodward
to verify or not information gathered in
their investigations.
There has been recently a great deal
of speculation about Deep- Throat and
whether he e x i s t s . A l l I c a n say i s that
the film Hal Holbrook makes the character
believable with a very convincing
performance. A l s o , Woodward, in an
interview with Time magazine last week,
stated that Deep Throat d i d exist and
would reveal himself one day.
The film is well acted throughout with
exposed
Redford and Hoffman conveying the
extreme sense of fear felt by the
reporters during their investigations and
a l s o their o b s e s s i o n with the story once
they had begun. Guest appearances by
Martin Balsam as the city editor and
Jason Robarbs a s B e n Brad lee as the
P o s t ' s executive editor provide a solid
back up. Jane Alexander gives a very
good performance a s the Bookeeper.
T e c h n i c a l l y this film is excellent.
450,00 dollars w a s spent on building an
exact 32,000 square foot duplicate of the
P o s t ' s newsroom. In fact, s o much care
has been paid to detail that no car in
the film is later than,a 1973 model, the
rubbish in the newsroom is real rubbish
collected from the P o s t ' s newsroom over
several weeks. They even hired Frank
W i l l s , the Watergate security guard who
discovered the robbery and sounded the
alarm, to play himself.
