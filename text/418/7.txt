Theatre Re-examination rewarded
Theatre Review: ' E q u u s ' by Peter Shaffer at the Albery Theatre
The first time I s a w Peter Shaffer's
play Equus I found it to be an
imaginatively staged thriller about the
psychiatric healing of a boy who committed
a savage attack on s i x horses. Sifting
down to see it again at the second
revival of the National Theatre's
production by John Dexter (this time at
the Albery Theatre) I wondered how the
play would stand up now that I knew the
outcome of the doctor's probings.
Within seconds of the p l a y ' s start
I w a s , again, totally absorbed, but now
it w a s with the depth of the piece that
concentration on the purely narrative
aspects had obscured. Equus is certainly
a play which, in that over-worked phrase,
repays re-examination. It supports,
through the agonising of the psychiatrist
over h i s attempts to bring h i s patient
back to a 'normal' e x i s t e n c e , the idea
that normality is deadening and that the
boy's so-called insanity is really a
passion that those of us with empty
I ives should envy.
The doctor, played by C o l i n B l a k e l y
with a warmth and sympathy that the
audience responds to, h a s problems of
h i s own with a wife who, we are told,
soon lost any passion she may have had
and so her husband s e e k s fulfilment for
h i s psyche, second hand, by studying
the primitivism of Ancient Greece and
its Gods. He is jealous of the boy who
finds, for himself, living gods in horses.
On paper, in one sentence, that sounds
bizarre and the brutal crime around which
the play is written may seem far-fetched,
although Shaffer bases his plot on a real
incident, but in the theatre the atmosphere
of sensuality and worship created not
least by the marvellous representation
of horses by men in simple though
ingenious masks and heightening hooves,
forces us into the p l a y ' s e x e g e s i s of how
thin is the line between genius and
madness.

Over-abundance of talk
The Royal Shakespeare Company's
series of Gorky productions, at the
A l d w y c h , continues with The Zykovs.
T h i s is a play that is less overtly
political than much tum-of-the-century
R u s s i a n drama; particularly bearing
in mind that Gorky became the doyen of
R u s s i a n literature after the revolution,
even to the extent of having h i s home
renamed Gorky.
Mikhail Zykov is engaged to P a v l a
T s e l o v a n y e v a s ; soon, however, h i s
father steps in and declares h i s affection
for the girl. With the a i d of smooth talk
and financial incentive (he is a self-made
timber merchant) he proposes a marriage
that is doomed from the start. If a l l this
sounds a bit far fetched you must
understand that P a v l a h a s spent the
past five years in the convent school
and is out of touch with the realities of
life. Time and time again she declares
her belief in love a s the true guiding
principle; she f a i l s to r e a l i s e that the
type of love preached in the convent is
too frail a concept to stand up to the
passionate love of her husband, Antipa.
Once P a v l a and her mother are
installed in the Z y k o v house hold, she
finds that the only person she is not
afraid of is her erstwhile fiance. A
strange change comes over the characters;
A n t i p a paces about not caring for h i s
business; the sour head keeper, shokhin,
decides to leave because of P a v l a ' s
fear of h i m . The ability of a passive
character like P a v l a to alter the status
quo in a group of much stronger characters
is but one of the threads woven together
by Gorky.
A splendid performance, a s M i k h a i l ,
comes from Mike G w i l y m ; the eternal
floater, drinking too much and waiting
for something or someone to turn up.
Mia Farrow plays P a v l a with a wide
eyed innocence; whilst Gary Bond appears
as the correct German, proposing
marriage to A n t i p a ' s sister more refined
than her brother on the grounds that
together they might restore R u s s i a n
self-confidence.
If I do not seem whole-heartedly to
support this production it is because I
am not a great fan of R u s s i a n plays.
There is here as elsewhere an over-
bundance of talk; a s Tarakanov s a y s at
the opening of A c t II; " Y o u can't do
without philosophy, s i n c e everything
nas its hidden meaning which we must
k n o w " .
Next Saturday, May 15, w i l l be your
last chance, for the present, to s e e two
new plays by Tom Stoppard at the Almost
Free Theatre. A s its name suggests the
prices charged at the Almost free are
rock-bottom; in fact you c a n choose the
sum (50p is about average), to suit your
pocket, but you a l s o have to join the
Ambiance Lunch Hour Theatre C l u b ;
this c a n be done at the door.
The two plays are Dirty L i v e n and
New-Found-land and both contain a l l
the Stoppard T r i c k s of double entendre
pun, Malapropism and obscure literary
references. The cast is headed by a
number of well known names currently
appearing on the West E n d stage. T h e
performance starts at 1.15 and runs about
an hour but you are well advised to get
there early as a queue soon builds up.
Certainly this *s something that shouldn't
be m i s s e d , e s p e c i a l l y if you are already
a confirmed Stoppard addict and c a n
dispense with lunch for one d a y .

Music Head's heart not in mouth
Murray Head - Say It A i n ' t So (Island I L P S 9347)
After such an impressive debut single
I w a s rather looking forward to an
equally talented L P . Not s o ; in fact the
bulk of H e a d ' s efforts earn him zero for
star quality and three (out of ten) for
effort.(even by B l a c k Sabbath standards).
My name isn't Tony Hatch either1
Outside the title track Boat's Away
& Don't Forget To Let Him Know are
the only tracks to stand out. The other
seven barely deserve more than the words
drab, ordinary & insubstantial. Either
producer Paul Samwe 11-Smith & Head
don't make music together or Head
is rather low on talent. Judging trom the
frail v o c a l s I suspect the latter. Either
way, neither producer or artist has made
full use of the experienced s e s s i o n
m u s i c i a n s on the album.
A medlee of three acoustic guitars,
tasteful string arrangement, extensive
background singers and overdubs
dominates the L P ' s best track Say It
Ain't So. A beautiful s t y l i s h example of
all that's good in modern music. B o b
Weston (acoustic & s l i d e guitars) holds
the track together, a s he does on the
L P ' s other goodies. Boat's Away i s a
cute undramatic crib of C a t Stevens'
Longer Boats, but once you accept that
it's quite pleasant. L i k e w i s e Don't
Forget Him Now, a delicate ditty
enhanced by S u e L y n c h ' s v o c a l s and some
gifted piano playing from Murray Head.
Both give the vitality m i s s i n g on the
other tracks.
T h e album's worst cuts are You're
So Tasty, an unromantic soul cover
version of We Do It and a mediocre
attempt at Someones Rocking My
Dreamboat. George Me My could do it
much better.
T o conclude, if you've bought the
single don't bother buying the L P .
Murray Head h a s , I fear, yet to discover
what he does best. H e might w e l l have
been flustered by h i s first venture to a
recording studio, but that's no excuse
for.fsland to release Insuncere trash.
