Sunday XI followed the
example of the 1st teams
Saturday performance with a
more modest 100 runs victory
over Berkeley Athletic at
Harlington. Captain Max Taylor
won the toss and elected to
bat; a very diplomatic d e c i s i o n
considering that half his
team were late in arriving. He
then opened the batting with
Arthur Mulholland and this
pair put on over 130 runs
before Mulholland was out
for 54. Taylor carried on his
bucol ic work and was eventual ly
out just before lunch for a
creditable 82.
The run rate of about 100
an hour was maintained after
the interval by Jeh Bashar
who scored 51 before the
skipper declared at three
o'clock with 244 for 3 on the
scoreboard. T h i s generous
declaration gave Berkeley ample
time to score the runs but they
were unable to meet the
challenge. Four w i c k e t s from
Geof Thompson showed that
the Athletic were not able
to reply to this total and the
result of the game was no
longer in doubt. T h i s result
meant that two IC s i d e s had
scored nearly 500 runs in
just two matches!

It was a resounding victory
and a confident start to the
season which must be
consolidated at Cambridge
tomorrow.

IC 2nd XI v Luton College
Scores:- IC 146 Luton 112
THIS E X T R E M E L Y c l o s e
game was decided with less
than two overs to go. IC
batted first and were quickly
in trouble at 26 for 2. However
good partnerships between
Causey and Sparke and then
Trewhella and Hagger pushed
along the score to 101 for
6 at t e a . A f t e r light refreshment
(non-alcoholic), IC increased
their scoring rate and despite
losing w i c k e t s , reached the
respectable total of 146.
Luton started very c o n -
fidently and briskly put on
46 runs for their first wicket
in only ten overs. Accurate
bowling accompanied by
tight fielding slowed their
scoring rate but at 91 for
for three the odds were very
much in their favour. Some
excellent bowling by Gowlett
and Sparke caused a sudden
c o l l a p s e in which Luton lost
six wickets for only 16 runs.
So with* only 5 overs left IC
needed to take one more
wicket for victory. T h i s was
achieved with only eight balls
to spare when Gowlett had
their last batsman stumped.
In all it was a remarkable
team effort for a side playing
in it's first match of the
s e a s o n . Unfortunately the
after match celebrations were
spoilt by the coach failing to
turn up.
A F T E R A series of mechanical
troubles with the racing
Honda, the B i k e C l u b has
f inal ly been racing. Our intrepid
heroes, Martin B l e a s d a l e and
N i c k James, went to the
V e l o Owners C l u b race meeting
at C a d w e l l Park, L i n c o l n s h i r e ,
on April 3rd, and raced their
road bikes against such riders
as Tom Pemberton and Dave
E a s t . Martin was on his
Kawasaki 400 S3 and N i c k
was on a 500cc Velocette
Venom which had been
slightly breathed upon by a
racing friend, B i l l M e l v i l l e .
The practice s e s s i o n before
the races was the first time
N i c k had been on a track, but
when he finished practice ten
minutes later, the grin joined
up at the back of his neck!
The pair had each entered
in two Vi hour high speed
trials and in an 8 lap race,
N i c k competing in an additional
8 lap race.
Much to the amazement of
all concerned, neither fell off
and both actually managed to
give a good account of them-

The annual Isle of Man
Easter A t h l e t i c F e s t i v a l ,
held over Easter week-end,
was the focal point of the
s e a s o n ' s a c t i v i t i e s for the
cross-country c l u b , hitherto
known as Hyde Park Streakers.
The multi-faceted gathering
of all-stars included such
well-known faces as Speedy
Steve Webb, B S c , Gary Glitter
and A l v i n Stardust, C Hunder,
and last Smooth'N E a s y
Donnelly. Wtih such a parade
of talent, how could we
f a i l ?
The answer to this fateful
question was q u i c k l y provided
by the first race, the Good
Friday 4 mile road race.
Comprising a steep downhill
section for much of the first
mile, and a corresponding
uphill section for the last
mile, the course was obviously
designed to cripple anyone
who was not 100% fit. T h i s
did not prevent 166 runners
finishing; for the Streakers,
our two ageing pop stars,
Gary and A l v i n , had their
own personal battle which
was won narrowly by A l v i n
(24th in 21:24). Speedy Steve,
recouping the benefits of
actually knowing the course,
ran a personal best of 22:06,
and these three valiant middle-
men enabled the first team to
silencer after the first high
speed trial, so N i c k had to
withdraw from the next event,
which caused him to m i s s the
the spectacle of Martin's
Kawasaki " w h e e l i e " away
from the start and lead the
race for 200 yards! Later
on, in the second high speed
trial, N i c k was about to over-
take Martin when the latter
had a spark plug blow out of
his engine which caused him
to pull off the track. Overall
the f i n i s h positions were:-
1st High Speed Trial - N i c k
12th, Martin 15th of 16.
1st 8 Lap Race - Martin 14th
of 18.
2nd High Speed Trial - N i c k
9th, Martin 12th of 15.
2nd 8 L a p R a c e - N i c k 10th
of 14.
Martin's fastest lap was 1min
3 2 s e c s (58.7mph).
N i c k ' s fastest lap was 1min
27secs (62.1mph).
For comparison, Dave
East on his V e l o got round in
about imin 20sec and Tom
Pemberton on h i s 500 K a w a s a k i
in about 1min 1 4 s e c s .

finish in a very respectable
eighth position.
Meanwhile, a little further
down the field, several
Streakers were struggling to
hide their obvious lack of
fitness accumulated over
the holidays. Hacker E l l i s
(23:33) w a s , for once, reduced
to the lowly ranks of the
second team, though this
team did feature good runs by
C Hunter (24:38) and Mr
Johnson (25:13). Boyo Davey
(26:02) led home the third
team, with sturdy support from
the back, in the form of
Terror Tarnowski and Smooth'
N E a s y .
Next day was the 4 x 3 mile
relay, the streaker's results
being:
