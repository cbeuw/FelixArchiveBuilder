A word f o m de sponsor
H E R E I Y A M agin, de litt'ry
pearls o' wisdom droppin f'om
my mouf faster dan de
S c i e n t i s t s at de G u i l d s B a r
Night. Acturly, I bin implored
by some notable number to
cast de expertise an de
political unnerstanding on de
noo gumments resultin' f'om
de recent election happening
aftah de celebrated hoistings
in de Grate H a l l , noos d which

Postman, cant git up de stairs
fo' de fly in' milk bottles an
de dead miner on de presidential
landing, bin sellotaped to de
bannisters by de Y o u n g ' s
Conservatives if y o u a s k me.
I, off c o a r s e , am offrin'
my deepest condolenses to de
loosing oppersition. I sujest
dat dey s l i p a few s a c k s o'
de loot to de external examinars
to insure dat de nooly elected
cabinets are becoming past o'
de 50% nat'ral wastage dat
d i s college am accustomed
to these days, a n ' if dey
ain't den there int nuffin like
a coo wot de G u i l d s pulled
this year when d i s H o y l e

de Ahlers moneky out w i v de
freat o' de degree havin' to be

In de mines, de 'ard hats

In "de riotous election takin'
place l a s ' term, de Tom
The Met Soc meets
again
Apparently determined to
test our loyalty, the Meteoro-
logical and Environmental
Society not only held last
w e e k ' s meeting at 6pm, but
chose a Friday evening for it.
Nevertheless some 15 people
turned up, including the
speaker, a Dr David P e d g e l e y ,
once of IC and now doing pest
research, who was to talk
about weather and the
migration of airborne i n s e c t s .
I w a s to try and get the story
into F E L I X . H e looked like
an insect collector: bemused,
slightly built, with thin-rimmed
g l a s s e s and a pullover slightly
too large. I tried to look
like a reporter with a little
notebook and pen at the
ready, while the less motivated
sprawled with disdain at such
a swot.
But now i t ' s Monday
morning; many more braincells
have been flushed to the
Thames and out to s e a and
that notebook in not proving
much help for the writing. Have
you heard how 14 million
Oriental Army-worm Moths
were carefully marked by the
C h i n e s e before release, and
only 14 were recovered?
Apparently (my notes are not
clear) they gave them a
radioactive feed. A c r e s of
insects s i t flapping their
wings and doing heavy
breathing to reach the
"temperature threshold for
f l i g h t " (The energy they win
need once airborne is found
by "tethering insects in the
l a b " , presumably to run them
into the ground).
I wish I could give a fair
account of the talk, which
everybody enjoyed, but only
a few choice quotations
remain. L i k e the distracting
one about "nymphs becoming
s o crowded, literally on top
of each other", or the c y n i c a l
" s t i c k in a light, or a female,
or some rotten food, to
attract a m a l e " . But what
kind of a story c a n you get
out of " m a s s t a k e - o f f s " ,
" s y n c h r o n o u s e m e r g e n c e " ,
" f i n i t e fall s p e e d s " and " a
locust c a n see a locust at
30 m e t r e s " ? The last page is
about a trip to E a s t A f r i c a :
" t h e only way to catch these
f l i e s is to s i t around and be
bitten. So fly-boys were hired
to s i t by the river There
may be a shock horror probe
there somewhere, but not
today.
The next meeting is a l s o
at 6pm, but on Thursday, May
13th, in Room 719 of the
New Huxley B u i l d i n g . " H a i l ,
hailstorms, and hail suppres-
s i o n s " , with coffee and
b i s c u i t s to follow. Wow!

Sweet fairy, beautiful and true,
Give me your answer,
Tell me do,
How shines the moon on you?
Dear pixy, I'm fine
As any sunny summer's day.'
Sweet smiling fairy maid true,
Give me your answer,
Tell me do,
W! 1
1 you meet me at nine
For wine and dinne
Tonight I trust
Together we must
Make the most of this bliss?
Oh! Virtuous pixy Sir,
Thankyou for your 'and invitation.
Accept I do,
And soon I will away
To prepare, this happy day.
My lovely fairy mistress true,
I thank you much,
I thank you, I do,
For now I know you rue the past,
Our time together can forever last
But for a short time
There will be wine
To confuse and amuse us
As we dance and romance
Down the road of true love.
So see you soon, my fairy love.'
Attend to those things,
Your clothes and your rings.'
Powder your nose,
Straighten your hair,
And, make your eyes shine bright,
For we'll be together forever tonight.
HOWARD PHILLIPS
