Rosen shines
F O R T H E second time in
three months Stirling U n i v e r s i t y
was the centre for a B r i t i s h
U n i v e r s i t i e s Sports Federation
( B U S F ) championships. C r o s s -
country in February, and last
weekend for Orienteering.
Members of the C o l l e g e club
joined other orienteers from
the University of London to
form a combined team.
The Championships c o n s i s t e d
of an individual event on
Saturday near K i l l in on the
banks of Loch T a y and a
relay team event on Sunday at
The Forest near A l l o a .
The individual course w a s
mainly sparse forest or open
f e l l s i d e , and the mens 8.0km
' A ' course included 370
metres of c l i m b i n g . However,
spare time IC cross-country
runner and international
orienteer David Rosen,
proved he had the stamina
for this type of course by
winning the individual
championships in 53 mins
16 s e c , a clear margin of
2V2 mins from Pete N i c h o l s of
Loughborough. Next for
London w a s A l i s t a i r D o y l e ;
69.53m ins and Richard
Gardner; 70.00mins. T h e s e
were followed home by C
R e i d , R A l l i n s o n and S Webb.
On the mens' ' B ' course
(5.4km) first U L runner home
was lan McAnulty, 30th in
69.09 followed by T Murphy
and L Fawcett. M Welford
mispunched 2 controls thus
spoiling an otherwise respect,
able time.
On the womens ' B ' course
our only lady competitor,
Diane Benge, had a good run
to finish 6th in a time of 76.18.
Not content with h i s
s u c c e s s of the afternoon,
David Rosen w a s a l s o
amongst the prizes at the
C e i l i d h on Saturday evening.
A b l y accompanied by Diane
Benge they fulfilled a l l
qualifications in an elimination
dance and then won the
wheelbarrow race between the
last 3 couples left on the
floor. However, a l l w a s
forgiven when he promised to
share around the beer he won.
In contrast to Saturday's
event, the course on Sunday
was a heavily wooded section
of undulating countryside, one
section c o n s i s t i n g of a
complicated network of
intersecting forest rides
separated by dense under-
growth.
The U L 1st team was given
a good start when A l i s t a i r
Doyle completed the 1st leg
only Vi minute down on the
leaders in a time of 33 - 2 8 .
Richard Gardner then kept
the team right' up with the
leaders on the second leg
handing over to David Rosen
only 4 seconds down on the
leaders. However, with our
biggest rivals only 100secs
down on us at this stage David

could not afford any costly
mistakes. He in fact increased
our lead to 2
V
2 minutes thus
winning two gold medals in
as many days. F i n a l p l a c i n g s :
1. London 102.51
2. Oxford 104.26
3. Aberystwyth 112.57
The London 2nd team were
not s o s u c c e s s f u l and many
e x c u s e s were put forward
afterwards. T h e team of C
R e i d , R A l l i n s o n and S Webb
completed the course in a time
of 197.00; a mere 9 5 mins
behind London 1st team.
Our lady competitor,
Diane, joined up with L i v e r -
pool University for the relay
race and ran 2nd leg taking
over in 3rd place from the
B U S F individual ladies
champion Sue Barker. Diane
had yet another good run
keeping the Liverpool team
in 3rd position, but unfortunately
the last leg runner was unable
to match this. Rob Allinson in action

Sparkling runs by A l v i n
and Gary raised the first team
from 22nd to 10th. The second
team performed c o n s i s t e n t l y ,
though even Babyface could
not save the honour of the
third team after two very
steady runs by Terror and
Smooth'N E a s y had left him
4mins behind the next man.
Easter Sunday morning,
and the fell race up Greba
mountain. N o amount of fore-
warning c a n possibly help
those being initiated into the
sport of fell-running/walking.
They must battle it out them-
s e l v e s , fight the good fight -
and give in q u i c k l y . But to
those practiced in the art,
there may be ways of
tackling this masochistic
enterprise (and succeeding)
C Hunter, on this fateful day
in A p r i l , thought he had found
a w a y . Setting off like a
bullet out of a gun, he led the
race for much of the first
quarter mile. Hoping that h i s
momentum would carry him
up the fell with the leading
runners, "he valiantly swept
uphill at a rate of knots â€” but
no, back he dropped, to
struggle at the back along
with the rest of us who were
already resigned to w a l k i n g .
Nevertheless, s e v e r a l
Streakers d i d w i n their
personal battles with the
f e l l , notably Speedy Steve in
29:13, a minute ahead of
Gary and H a c k e r . Strapped up
like an Egyptian mummy,
Granny battled resourcefully
against Mr Johnson, who flew
down the fell in 33:05. Baby-
face, benefiting from a week
in Scotland, ran creditably
for 36:26, finally ' beating
Boyo. A l a s , at the back, the
decrepit pop star, A l v i n
Stardust, confined to premature
retirement, and Smooth'N E a s y ,
in an unofficial time of 52
mins, were beaten by the
mountain. W e l l , there i s always
next year.
That same evening were
the boat races. Not across the
Irish Sea, but teams of 4
supping a l e extremely fast.
The first team won their
first round heat, but were
narrowly beaten in the second
round owing to a cock-up
in the draw by the organisers.
The second team d r a n k s t e a d i l y
someone should have told
them it w a s a race. After
c l o s i n g time at ten pm, a l l
indulged in a mass sing-song,
however, owing to the Offical
Secrets A c t , the remainder of
the evening's a c t i v i t i e s
remain sub-judice.
F i n a l l y , w e would like to
thank A C C for providing the
tour grant to offset the c o s t s
of the weekend; and a l s o
Manx A C , who organised the
whole weekend. T h e C r o s s -

off for this s e a s o n , but
