Scandalous says Teague
IT A P P E A R S that the
Hardship Fund set up by
the U G C in all universities
is to be phased out'. T h i s
is the implication of a
U G C directive sent to
the College via the
University of London'.
Only those students who
were helped by the Fund this
s e s s i o n can be helped again
next s e s s i o n , but only in
respect of the £70 increase
implemented this s e s s i o n . It
w i l l not be p o s s i b l e to use
the Fund to help freshers
and students who have not
used the Fund before when the
30% increase in fees is
implemented next s e s s i o n .
Over £11,000 has been paid
out of the C o l l e g e ' s Hardship
Fund to 33 home students and
127 overseas students up t i l l
last February. The Hardship
Fund would have to be abolish-
ed once all the continuing
students using the Fund had
left the C o l l e g e . The U G C has
yet to issue a policy statement
over the question of the F u n d .
In a letter to Mr Peter
Teague I C U P r e s i d e n t ,
informing him of this ruling,
M r P e t e r M e e , C o l l e g e Registrar
says there is no indication
that this ruling was likely to
be changed.
Mr Teague has written to
the Rector over the matter. He
has also written to the N U S
who apparently did not know of
this ruling. Commenting on the
ruling, Mr Teague said it was
" t o t a l l y s c a n d u l o u s " . He w i l l
be asking the Rector to stand
by his pledge that no student
w i l l have to leave the C o l l e g e
due to the increase in tuition
fees.
Mr D a v i e s , the C o l l e g e
Secretary, said yesterday that
he stood by the R e c t o r ' s
statement. Students in
financial difficulty unable to
use the F u n d next s e s s i o n
" w i l l be sympathetically
considered by the C o l l e g e " ,
he s a i d .
Hain back at IC
F O R M E R IC student, P e t e r
H a i n , in conversation last
Tuesday, urged the C o l l e g e
to boycott South A f r i c a n
goods and break off all l i n k s
with apartheid.
Mr Hain was speaking at a
meeting of the L i b e r a l C l u b .
In h i s talk he dealt with
identification evidence in
criminal prosecutions, using
h i s own recent experience as
a graphic illustration of how
the law can go wrong. He
warned that a completely
innocent bystander could be
plucked out and a " d e m o r a l i s i n g
and terrifying e x p e r i e n c e " ,
inflicted upon him in which,
" f a c t s become d r e a m s . "
D i s c u s s i n g h i s c a s e , he
revealed that the trial had
"ground through" for two
w e e k s , spending £50,000 of
public money, on the evidence
of three schoolboys and a
fleeting glimpse, by a cashier,
of the bankrobber. He did not
think that the c a s h i e r , who
identified him, was dishonest,
merely mistaken. She h a d p i c k e d
him out in an identity parade;
on the same day the E v e n i n g
Standard carried a photograph of
Mr H a i n . However, five other
witnesses s t i l l f a i l e d to
identify him.
He claimed that there
were a whole series of
"trigger h a p p y " p o l i c e
prosecutions on doubtful
identification evidence and
c i t e d the now famous c a s e of
George D a v i s ( O K ? ) .
Prosecutions brought solely
on identification evidence
" p r o v i d e d more injustices
than any other part of the
L a w " and he advocated that
no-one should be charged on
identification evidence without
corroboration. Mr H a i n did
not d i s m i s s the notion that a
South African agent in London
was discrediting him, but he
thought it unlikely.
Pefer Hain
Answering q u e s t i o n s
afterwards, Mr H a i n , a w e l l
known anti-apartheid cam-
paigner since h i s days in
Mech E n g I, (he stopped the
'70 tour), thought that Britain
should help fund the South
African liberation movements.
R h o d e s i a and South West
A f r i c a would almost certainly
achieve majority rule, and it
was better that the transition
be seift. He saw no alternative
to armed struggle. " U n f o r t u n -
ately violence w o r k s " , he
s a i d . The future of South
A f r i c a he believed to be in
the hands of the U S A and he
welcomed Dr K i s s i n g e r ' s
statement of support for
African N a t i o n a l i s t s .
F i n a l l y , Peter H a i n , b i l l e d
as " e v e r y b o d y ' s favourite
r a d i c a l " , a l s o c r i t i c i s e d
Jeremy Thorpe's idea of the
L i b e r a l Party a s , " 5 0 years
out od a t e . " Anyone b e l i e v i n g
in the L i b e r a l s traditional
stance, he thought should j o i n
the Labour P a r t y , the L i b e r a l
Party was not a party of
Government but a " r a d i c a '
a l t e r n a t i v e . "
