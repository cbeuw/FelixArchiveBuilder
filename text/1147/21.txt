Role playing games are suddenly gaining
a bit of popularity. Even as far back as the
old 8-bit prehistory days there were a few
hardened souls playing the temple trilogy
on the creaky commodore 64, but things
have moved on. The worlds are no-
longer flat 2D plans and the characters
and games are much less repetitive than
they were. Could Silver be another in the
line of FFVII and Zelda64 to encourage
the average Quake head to take up the
sword and bow rather than the rocket
launcher?
The story, above all, the story! They
all come with a story and Silver is no
exception to the rule. In a galaxy a long
way away, or something like that, a
despotic and magical ruler (Silver) and his
cronies rule the land in a way that would
lead Amnesty International to have a
small cattery of kittens. His wife's trapped
in a rather loveless marriage and, realis-
ing that Silver is not really the 'let's be
friends' kind, kills herself. Silver then goes
about the task of finding a new wife by
taking all of the women in his kingdom
off to his castle. A few of the mensfolk
take offence and start to
form small camps in the
forest
intending
to bring
down Sil-
ver and
bring back the women -
and hopefully before tea
time.
You start as David. His
wife's been abducted,
and his grandfather is
chopped up by Silver's
son pretty early in the
story - reason enough to
join the resistance and
hunt down Silver and
have a chat about police
state brutality. Through-
out the many worlds, and
despite taking control of
others as your party
grows, he is your main
fighter character. He's
pretty nifty with the sword
and quite neat with the
shield, which is handy for
supporting any argument
with creatures from other
demonic worlds. The con-
trol method is pretty sim-
ple to grasp - the point and click
movement and a slightly more complex
if w
point, click and hold down a button to
direct the sword and missile targeting
doesn't really require many
hours of practice to master.
Selecting items is also sim-
plicity itself, though as you
are rummaging through the
backpack the enemies do a
good job of turning you into
a David kebab.
It would not be a fan-
tasy game without the lib-
eral sprinkling of magic
items and spells. David soon
gets a magical sword which
fires small painful doses of
magic at his enemies, and
while Davy boy isn't a true
magic user, other members
of your team are much
more adept at throwing
more powerful magic
across the room. The puz-
zles, though, are fairly basic,-
the brainpower here is in
organising the troops and
fighting the enemy in the
correct
order rather
than work-
ing out
which lever
opens which door, for
once I'm not complain-
ing - this is a game which you can enjoy
rather than lose your hair over.
The graphics are impressive for this
type of game, the main characters wan-
der about the detailed pseudo 3D back-
grounds, and are well animated even if
they move a little bit too mechanically-
perhaps the arnie swinging shoulder
look is back in for the beefed out hero
types. The sounds are also better than
expected, swords and shields clank and
bang, magic fizzles magically and
machinery make industrial clanging
noises.
Overall the game will keep you
entertained for a very long time - longer
than it takes for NATO to win a war
against a european state with one army
tied behind their back. And yes even the
odd Quake head might be able to put
aside his rocket launcher and move over
to the fantasy side. Just make sure that
they don't realise that they are playing a
fantasy game for the first five minutes
and by then it will be too late - the addic-
tion will have been firmly planted.

Sega's new 128bit baby prepares for a September birth.
Fresh from the UK post E3 press event for
Sega's new big boy in the console mar-
ket, the UK and ace reporter G has gone
from knowing nothing to knowing pretty
much everything about the new
machine.
Sega are promising a September
launch, and for your Â£199 you get not
only the fastest console on the market,
but instant access to the internet, e-mail
and a www browser - try all that with a
PC for the price. Sega have managed to
team up with BT and ICL to create the first
Europe wide local call cost ISP portal for
the Dreamy one. BT will handle the dial
up and ICL the online service design.
The problem with these new shiny
consoles is the scarcity of available soft-
ware. Whereas the Sony 2 machine
promises to be able to play old games,
Sega have not gone down this route
and will instead have ten fresh spanking
A-titles available in September, with
another twenty to be released for the
Christmas rush.
Aside from the e-mail and web
browser bits the internal modem does
have a gaming use. O n e of the first will
be for Take the bullet.
Take the bullet is set against a pres-
idential campaign in the late 60's. Play-
ing a bodyguard to a threatened
candidate you can defend the main man
in either first or third person view.
Though it sounds a little bit like Golden-
eye it gives the option of using either the
controller or, for the realist, the Dream-
cast lightgun. Once again rooms about
the country will ring out with the cry
"He's armed, take him down".
But where's the modem come in?
we all cry. Well there's a fancy death-
match mode where four players on a sin-
gle machine can attempt to drill lead
holes in each other. There is the similar
option to play the same deathmatch
over the phone line against fifteen oth-
ers - see, the modem is used.
Rather than use simple boring bits of
plastic in order to store game info Sega
have created the Visual Memory system.
These are bits of plastic with a led display
that plug into a hole in the handset. The
VMS unit not only stores game info and
scores. It can be used to change options
without them popping up on the screen,
so if you really wanted you could tell your
virtual Beckham to be impetuous and
kick out without anyone realising or actu-
ally noticing. It can be used as a clock and
a calendar (though a watch seems to do
a similar job in my book), it can also be
used as a hand held games machine and
can even connect to another VMS unit to
play 2 player games.
I or all those who want to know what
games art; on their way, while looking a
little heavy on the arcade side there's a
bit of delight for everyone.
