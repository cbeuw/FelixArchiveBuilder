Students Show Little Interest in Strike
The Association of University Teachers'
one-day strike, which took place at
colleges across the country last Tues-
day (25 May), has been described as
a success by its organisers. The effec-
tiveness of the strike here at Imperial
is more questionable however, as is
the overall outcome of the industrial
action.
Services within college were unde-
niably affected, with the central library
closing earlier than usual and many
departments going without key acad-
emic personnel for the day. According
to Ms Laura Barker, AUT representative
at the college, the AUT "mounted an
effective picket": O n the ground, how-
ever, there was relatively little sign of
the strike, and most campus entrances
were left unpicketed throughout much
of the day.
According to the Registry all exam-
inations scheduled for last Tuesday
went ahead as planned. As Felix went
to press it was unclear whether any
students had skipped exams, but it
seems unlikely, suggesting wide-
spread student apathy towards the
strike. Ms Barker c o m m e n t e d "stu-
dents ranged from those fully sup-
portive and joining us on the picket
line to those who had little information

or interest in the issue." She described
most students as "sympathetic but
understandably concerned with their
own affairs".
AUT action was more successful
elsewhere in London, with pickets and
rallies generating much press inter-
est. Outside London a series of pick-
ets and rallies ensured that the AUT
got its message across. Although stu-
dent support was mostly confined to
NUS representation, students at
A b e r d e e n h a n d e d out stickers in
examination halls and joined in AUT
rallies. At most universities exams went
ahead, using non-AUT staff to Invigi-
late, but at many campuses it was far
harder to organise them than at Impe-
rial. According to AUT sources Liver-
pool University was practically closed.
Clayponds Approved
Clayponds is at last to be built a Vil-
lage hall', after years of discussion
and campaigning. The decision was
finalised at the Rector's Committee
on Student Residences, held last
week, and should result in a new
social area for the hall, which is situ-
ated in South Ealing, o p e n i n g in
about a year's time.
Details of the plans for building
the social area were still vague as
Felix went to press, with neither col-
lege nor ICU sources b e i n g able to
confirm exactly how the project will
be f u n d e d . It has b e e n s u g g e s t e d

sonable for the project, but it could
cost considerably less. Some money
will almost certainly be provided by
the IC Trust, with the rest being gen-
erated from increased rents: It seems
likely that residents of Clayponds will
see their weekly bill increase by
about £1.20 a week for the next five
years. A l t h o u g h many have sug-
gested it is a dangerous precedent to
fund hall projects by increasing rents,
a survey of Clayponds residents
revealed that 8 0 % of them would be
prepared to pay Ihe exlra rent in
order to get the hall built.
If the project goes according to
plan, the new building should be fin-
ished sometim e next Spring Term,
and possibly even by the end of 1999.
David Hellard, ICU President, was vety
pleased with the decision, but added
a cautionary warning on Ihe subject
of increased rents; "presumably the
rents will drop back down after five
years."
Dr Mark Tyrer, warden of Clay-
ponds, was unfortunately unavailable
for comment at the time of going to
print.
Although there was strong sup-
port from the NUS, support from indi-
vidual student unions was less
forthcoming. Leeds Student Union did
actively support the strike, but ICU
was less than vocal on the subject.
David Hellard, ICU President, hoped
that students had taken his advice and
c o m e in to college if they had exami-
nations, but vowed to fight college if
any students had been penalised for
missing them. Ms Barker stated "we
avoided putting any pressure on stu-
dents who reported that they were
going in for exams".
All AUT members who were on
strike are s u p p o s e d to have pay
deducted: The University and Colleges
Employers Association issued instruc-
tions that the amoun t deducted
should be 1 /260th of the striker's pay.
Most institutions, including Imperial,
have accepted the AUT's proposal that
the amount deducted be 1/365th of
the striker's pay. Pay deducted from
staff should be given to the university's
hardship funds, but it was unclear at
the time of going to print whether or
not Imperial would take up this idea.
Further industrial action may be in the
pipeline for later this month and next
year.
