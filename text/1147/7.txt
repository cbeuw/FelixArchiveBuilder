Mmmm. Statistics
Kevin was pleasantly surprised when
he learnt of the real-life nature of the
statistics exams taken by first year med-
ical students at Imperial. The exams,
which are taken whilst sitting in front
of a computer involve being given a
set of experimental data, choosing an
appropriate test, and instructing the
computer to carry the test out. This
process is made idiot-proof by the
inclusion in the program of a very use-
ful and easy to use 'help system',
which explains the circumstances in
which each statistical test should be
used, and contains instructions on how
to interpret the results. Perhaps the
fact that that no one had specifically
told the medics about the 'help' fea-
tures incorporated into the program
explains the fact that not all the
wannabe doctors passed the exam.
Carry on regardless
For reasons best known to themselves,
medics are an arrogant and indepen-
dent bunch all over the world and
those lecturing here at IC's medical
school are no exception. Recently a
malfunction in the BMS technics
resulted in a medical lecture being
broadcast to both the medical and
biology lecture theatres. Whilst the lec-
turing doctors voice was booming out
of the loudspeakers, a poor biology
lecturer was left
helpless and unable
to continue her lec-
ture over the ethe-
real voice of the
doctor. The doctor
lecturing the medics
was made aware of
the problem; how-
ever, as the fault was
It's all too complex for its own good."
MIT here we come
Imperial College's status as the MIT of
Europe in terms of its academic stand-
ing is unquestionable. However, Impe-
rial's students have a lot to do before
we can compete on
the world stage with
those at MIT. Stu-
dents at MIT are
revered worldwide
for their 'hacks', the
most recent of which
was to transform a
huge classical dome

not directly affecting A Mostly Harmless Column by tute's buildings into

the positive publicity generated by this
stunt, the MIT authorities have agreed
to leave the structure intact for the
time being. Anyone with technical or
artistic abilities interested In partici-
pating in a simple experiment to find
out how Sherfield would react to the

Biologists confused by the dark
Kevin had the misfortune to be in the
BMS during the recent electrical surge.
The windowless medical, and biology
lecture theatres were plunged into
complete datkness for a few minutes.
The whole building had 'died'; the
whirr of the building, the background
hiss caused by the air conditioning
and microphone systems in the lecture
theatres all went silent... a few minutes
later the lecturer in the biology lecture
theatre made the observation; "Well
the emergency lights have come on
now...but we don't seem to have a
powered up OHP." Kevin wonders just
what this peptidoglycan specialist was
expecting: an 'Emergency OHP' to
pop up out of the floor perhaps?

Presidential Talk-Back
Summer Ball
B
y the time you read this there will
only be five days left to buy your
summer ball ticket. Holding
such a large event is always a risk for
the Union, the potential loss is huge;
around £100 0 0 0 . The styles of balls
across London (no rude c o m m e n t s
please) are very different and it is hard
to judge which one is best suited to
your students. Royal Holloway are
throwing a mini Glastonbury, with
bands ranging from the Bootleg Beat-
les to Republica, no food or drink and
you party in a marquee, where as
Q M W are having steps, hot dog stands
and not much else. Whether or not we
have the right balance, at least we can
guarantee a g o o d time, if not a ticket;
only five days left.
Nightline concert
T
onight is the band concert in aid
of Nightline. It's cheap, It's in
ULU and the cause is great, I'll be
going. When talking about the event
recently, in my usual 'ICU is great1
way
I boasted how Nightline was started in
ICU and moved onto ULU to promote
Itself to a larger number of people.
What I didn't know though, that they
kindly told was that ICU actually kicked
Nightline out for lack of payment; I
David Hellard, ICU President
couldn't imagine that happening in
such a socialist and understanding
institution.
Pandora's Box
mperial is full of strange traditions
and conventions, but by far the
strangest is Pandora's Box. Pan-
dora's Box is a black box that is kept in
the murky depths of the Presidents
Office. I don't know who started the
tradition or why, but the theory is that
each president puts in the box three
items that helped them get through
the year and that they found excep-
tionally useful. When I first saw the
box, I imagined that it would be full of
blackmail books, confidential infor-
mation and facts and I was right. O n e
of the most Interesting documents is
a confidential briefing on direct action
and how to occupy central adminis-
tration and the laws relating to it;
watch out Vernon.
There are also details of the cir-
cumstances surrounding the resigna-
tion of the Honourable secretary in
1983. As the end of my term grows
nearer, I have to try and match the
previous entries with something as
enlightening from my year. Although
there are many things that I have
found useful, it is very hard to fit the
Union Bar or speaking bullshit in the
box, so I thought I'd give you guys an
opportunity to be part of this unique
and strange tradition. If you know of
anything that has helped me through
my year or s o m e t h i n g interesting
about the Union that could go in the
box, please email me with the idea
presldent@lc.ac.uk, you have my per-
mission to be as creative as possible
