Union women win battle of the bars
The atmosphere was buzzing with South-
side and ICU supporters separated only
by the holy turf on which we now stood
- ready for Southside to kick off. Yes this
was the tie of the season between the
two biggest rival clubs in the College, if
not Britain. They met at Hyde Park, the
home of South Kensington Football.
Judging from the line-ups, we
appeared stronger and the fans were the
more confident and boisterous, whereas
the Southside lot were notably quiet.
Southside had most of the play in the
first minutes. Some frantic passing from
took them into the ICUnited defensive
territory. ICUnited got the ball into the
last third of the park when Mel cleared
from defence after tackling a Southside
player. The ball ended up at the feet of
Marie who defeated two Southside
defenders to fire home - scoring her first
Imperial goal ever. Southside kicked off
again, Amy and Anna kept up the
defence well, and it wasn't long before
Marie got the ball again, whacked the
Southside defence, spared them no
mercy and ICUnited were 2-0 up.
For the third time, Southside kicked
off but made progress into the United
half. The kick came to nothing, goalie
Florence whacked the ball upfield and it
came to a goal kick for Southsidc. Marie
completed her hattrick just before half
time when a long kick from Florence
placed the ball on the left wing. Cutting
inside and turning goalwards, the captain
ran across goal, turned and placed the
ball neatly between two defenders and
passed the reach of the goalie. "Sit
down, if you're three nil up!" screamed
the ICU supporters. Captain Marie
dropped back to defend with Amy tak-
ing her place as striker and within 3 min-
utes Flo had passed clear to Amy who
took a few touches before firing in a fan-
tastic shot. ICUnited 4, Southside 0. So
far so good, and the whistle blew for
half-time.
Super-sub Jess replaced Amy at half
time and ICUnited kicked off to find that
the referee had dropped the second
half to 15 minutes at the request of the
Southside players. He also seemed to
have taken pity on them when they
started receiving free kicks and throws
for no apparent reason. The game went
on regardless and it all changed as
United conceded a free kick near their
goal area. A mish mash of ICUnited
players formed half hearted wall which
parted to let the free kick through. Flo-
rence went mad as Marie tried to explain
that if the Berlin wall could fall, we had
a valid excuse for this one crumbling to
pieces.
Southside started off with "You're
not singing any more" and chants of
"We're going to win 5-4" when Marie
took the kick-off, charged into the South-
side defence and put another one in the
back of the net to take her tally to 4 and
the score back to a respectable 5-1. At
that point United fans went mad and
Southside went quiet once more. The
last remaining minutes saw Marie take
a free kick from 30 yards out which the
keeper saved. The final whistle blew and
it ended 5
