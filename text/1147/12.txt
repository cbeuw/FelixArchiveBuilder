And will an A# work here? Lovely.
W
ith all the hype that followed
France winning the World Cup
last summer you might have
thought that the people of Britain
would have had enough of their closest
neighbours. Flowever, as well, as
French managers and players still doing
well in the English premiership, it seems
as if 1999 is going to be another suc-
cessful year for French music in our
music charts.
The French music explosion began
in 1997 with the emergence of Daft
Punk's wondrous Homework album,
which was heralded by many as the
album of the year. This was followed in
1998 with a similar feat by Air with Moon
Safari. Then in summer 1998, as if the
football wasn't enough, the British pub-
lic choose the French Music Sounds Bet-
ter With You by Stardust for their main
summer anthem. When 1999 came
along, one might have thought it was
time for the Brit-boys to hit back, but the
French dominance has continued with
Cassius's fabulous 1999, and now we've
got the equally excellent Darkdancer by
Les Rythmes Digitales.
With Darkdancer, Les Rythmes Digi-
tales follow the pattern set by their fel-
low countrymen and the style is thus a
blend of pop, cheese, electro-80s and
the crucial touch of Frenchness. How-
ever, the similarity by no way takes the
edge or originality away from the music.
The sounds are different enough to be
refreshing, but similar enough to retain
that je ne sais quoi.
It starts off as it means to go on
with instant head-bobbing funk, and sim-
ple vocals that will have the listener
singing along almost as quickly. The
tunes follow similar patterns and the
non-complex structure only adds to the
appeal. There's also a number of guest
vocalists present on the album. Perhaps
the most interesting being Nik Kershaw,
who gave us the unforgettable Wouldn't
It Be Good in the 1980s. Kershaw's vocals
are present on Sometimes, which
although not as bad as the song with the
same name by Erasure, is not the best
track on the album. Nevertheless, guest-
ing on a tack by a credible dance act is
more forgivable for an '80s rock star
than trying to revive your flagging career
by landing a part in Eastenders.
So all in all those French boys have
done it again. Darkdancer is cheesy at
times, and it doesn't break any barriers
when it comes to music making, but it's
funky, it's groovy and I suppose above all
It's got that Frenchness. BI James
MAN OR ASTROMAN
Eeviac
*•
I your television?
W
hat can I say? This is weird,
seriously weird. Obsessed
with all that is vaguely futuris-
tic and scientific, Man or Astroman
have endeavoured to create the moth-
er of all 'space rock' albums and failed
miserably. This is so bad, so unbeliev-
ably boring that I am lost for words.
So here's the background; They are
a trio from Alabama who go by the
names of Birdstuff, Coco and Star Crunch
and I would describe their 'astrostyle' of
guitar playing as being not dissimilar to
your average 'boy along the corridor'
desperately attempting the opening
chords of Beetlebum for the 5th time at
maximum volume and still getting it
wrong.
The album is childishly simple in its
structure. Each track opens with some
random sample from a sci-fi film, the gui-
tars play fast and hard and sometimes,
if you're lucky, you might hear someone
sing. All in all, the appalling guitar play-
ing and screamed lyrics interjected with
samples of old men talking about futur-
istic type things make for a pretty unique
listening experience which I'm sure
some people could learn to appreciate.
The surf and skate kids love 'em because
they're so crazy. They have been known
to set fire to their heads on stage..How
cool is that?! Having slagged them off so
ruthlessly I feel I must send at least one
fairly positive comment their way; The
aforementioned samples scattered
throughout the album ate quite funny
and provide a much needed source of
entertainment that makes the guitar
playing just about bearable. Overall, the
most noticeable thing that hits you about
this album is aptly put in the very first
words you hear on pressing the play
button. 'It's the same old series of signals
over and over again' says the distinctively
futuristic sounding man in the opening
sample of Interstellar Hardrive.
Put over some wacky surfing film or
as the music for a computer game, these
13 tracks would sound brilliant. But with-
out the pictures that should accompany
the sound, listening to this is like torture.
In conclusion all I can say is give me
sci-fi geeks, give me futuristic lingo that
I don't understand, give me anything but
this. El Ingrid
hippy rock these kids arc: so
