Biblical References
Sorry, Mr or Ms '2nd yr bio undergrad', but
I couldn't resist it. Hopefully this won't
offend any fundamentalist Christians, but
I really don't like Bible quotes being used
to sum up or defend a position. Why?
Because you can find averse in the Bible
to defend pretty much anything. If anyone
has a good argument against this, which
won't lead to a protracted exchange of
biblical references, my ears are open.
And while I'm at it, I have to disagree
with your portrayal of my former depart-
ment's staff. Granted, there are a few
grumpy types, but I always found most
of the lecturers interesting and likable,
and very patient with my inability to
make lectures that started before 1 Oam.
Contains words that may offend
Prepare for some pedantry. Earlier on this
year, as I'm sure many of you remember,
I was forced to apologise in tail-between-
the-legs Sun-like style for printing the infa-
mous comic strip. Well, last Thursday I
discovered a copy of the C&GU Song-
sheet for the 1997 Fresher's Barnight in the
Felix Office. It had the usual Guilds' songs,
including 'The Engineers Song', which
contains such beautiful lyrics as "she was
split from arse to tit, and the whole fuck-
ing Issue was covered in shit" and the
(in?)famous 'Mayor of Bayswater's Daugh-
ter'; "She went to Glamorgan, her cunt like
a barrel organ".
If some individual paid for the
photocopying etc then I can't really
complain. If, however, it came out of
C&GU funds... well, I'd be surprised if
every Guildsman, and particularly
Guildswoman, thinks that is a good way
to spend public money. This little pedan-
tic ramble doesn't really have a conclusion,
but I would be interested to hear any
opinions on the subject. Can
language be as offensive as visual
portrayals? Suppose 50% of C&GU mem-
bers attended and enjoyed that barnight
- does that justify the songsheet? What if
it was 20%? 10%? Comments, as ever, are
welcome...
An Apology
OK, so most of this term's issues have
been somewhat below par - but that is to
be expected at this time of year. This
issue, I realise, is at the bottom of the chest
freezer. Its pages don't so much
sizzle as simper. This week, however, I
have an extra excuse. The viral/bacter-
ial/buggy thing (technical biological term)
that's been limping slowly around the
Union has finally got me, despite my daily
intake of 10xRDA Vitamin tablets.
Hopefully I was better by the
weekend, as I was going to the Home-
lands Dance Festival. I'm sure some of you
lot went, and I hope you had a good
one. Maybe I bumped into you... Ed
