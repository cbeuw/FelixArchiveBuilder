18 Clubscene 1 June 1999
Omnipotence
@The Imperial Gardens
Camberwell, SE5. Monthly Fridays,
10pm - 6 am, £12/£15. Capacity -
1,000. Dress code - funky clubwear.
It was the first birthday of this
ever-popular South London night
about two months ago, and they char-
acteristically celebrated it in style. The
night had all the ingredients necessary
for everyone concerned to have a top
night out. As I go through the review
the list will seem pretty familiar but,
after all, that's what makes a night
out great, and nowadays all too often
club promoters in the capital lose sight
of formula for successful nights.
Firstly the venue was nice. The
layout of small rooms and confusingly
winding corridors make the Imperial
Gardens intimate, but never too small
In capacity. This place can soak up a
surprisingly large amount of clubbers
within its fake-flower decor, although
it may have been better off having
one really large main dancefloor, as
there was a tendency for that old 'bar-
near-dancefloor problem' to niggle a
bit. But that's only a minor point. Over-
all the club itself is a great little venue,
despite not being very well known.
As for the music. Well, they only
went and got John "00" Fleming to
come in and headline. He's perhaps
one of the best around at the
moment, and his blend of uplifting
hard house and soft techno kept
everyone going until the very end.
He was ably assisted by Rachel Auburn
(of Candy Girls fame), and with this
combination there really were no
losers on the night. Happy music -
that's the only way of describing this
sort of stuff. Just try and dance to it
without a smile on you face. The way
all dance music should be, in my opin-
ion.
The promoters also did a fine job,
which is quite an uncommon thing in
this era of packaged super-clubs and
lack of attention to detail. Everything
was there on the night, from the
important aspects mentioned above
to the tiny little things that you notice
that make your night one to remem-
ber. I am, of course, referring to the
freebies that they handed out
throughout the night - sweets, mix
tapes, and even Omnipotence sticks
of rock. They also laid on piss-take
games for people to play when they
were relaxing away from the music.
The Rubix cubes, chess, checkers, and
colouring-in books with crayons were
very much appreciated.
And finally, and probably most
importantly Omnipotence appears to
attract a very friendly crowd. Slightly
dressed up, but not pretentious, the
crowd were revisiting the more
approachable days of clubbing a few
years back. Little attitude infiltrated
this night, and seeing as how this was
the 1 st birthday party, I guess it was full
of regulars. All in all a great place to
go and meet some wonderful people.
Enjoy.
Powerful clubbing
Escape From Samsara
\@The Fridge
Brixton. Fridays, 10.30pm - 6am,
£3/£10/£12. Capacity - 1,000. Dress
code - none.
Well, what more can we say about
this night? Not much really. If you are
a regular reader of Clubscene then
you'll have read my review on it a few
months back, and if I was to write
another it would just be a carbon
copy. You see, EfS never really
changes, and this is most definitely a
very good thing. Every week it delivers,
and this is why it is ranked as one of
the best clubnights in London. If
you've been you'll know what I mean,
and you know you'll keep on going
again and again. And if you haven't
Club Reviews by Giles
made it there yet, then put it right at
the top of your must-go places. You
know you won't regret it.
Wonderful escapism
Albums

Album of the Week
VARIOUS
'Necessary Pieces'
(Nordic Trax)
Canada's premier record label
Nordic Traxx release their first mix album
-and what an album it is too. Mixed by
Tyler 'T-Bone' Stadius the album is full of
tracks with deep beats, fresh melodies
and subtle jazz/ groove? influences.
Opening the proceedings is Sea to Sky s
'Up Jumped the Boogie' with its cool
beats and gentle melody sets the scene
for the rest of the album. Sounding very
much like American and UK house
fused together, you would be forgiven
that Laurent Gamier had produced it
Out In June.

Plaid
'Rest Proof Clockwork'
(Warp)
O n impulse, you think is just a col-
lection of random noises, but when you
listen carefully to it you discover it has
many influences be it rare groove, funk,
techno and even house. The music is
very electronic but flows srfioothlyfrom
track to track giving it elegance. A highly
complex album, but Plaid - arguably the
finest act of the experimental genre -
have created a masterpiece.

VARIOUS
'Glasgow Underground Volume 2'
(Glasgow Underground'
Kicking off with the deep yet jazz
influenced 'Winter Sadness', this double
CD album takes you'through a spell-
binding journey of excellent house
music. The album is a representation of
a scene that is now massive in Scotland
- that of the Glasgow underground.
Some of the tunes featured on this 22
track album include Idjut Boys/ Quak-
erman's 'Frog's Arrrse' with Its thumping
bass, Romanthony's 'Clap Ya Handz' with
its fresh guitar licks and gentle start lead
to. a breakdown that is simply awesome.
Excellent follow up album to the massive
