Official Formula 1 Racing (PC)

*•••
I've never quite seen why people get so
excited about Fl racing - after all, if you
compare it to driving up the M l on a wet
November Friday at about 7.30pm in a
rusty Renault 4 which catches the wind
side-on as you come over the hill just
south of Sheffield, Fl definitely comes a
poor second in terms of danger, excite-
ment and general adrenaline rush. I
think the attraction's more to do with
glamour - the shiny cars, the film-star-
esque drivers, the pitstop blondes and
the vast wadges of cash that are put
into squeezing a couple fewer inches per
gallon out of each engine. And Murray
Walker of course, who is admittedly good
value-for-money.
This is a very different racing game
from Tank Racer. As suggested by the
title, it is a simulation of Formula 1 Rac-
ing, except without the pitstop blondes
and, in my case anyway, the film-star-
esque drivers. Murray Walker's also lack-
ing, but more of that later. The
game has been produced with
the blessing of the Formula 1
Association, so can be
i i expected to be fairly close to
• the real thing. It contains all
the stuff you'd expect - accu-
rate (presumably - I haven't
measured them) models of all
the F1 tracks, all the current
teams and drivers, the ability to
tweak your car's set-up, multi-
ple camera views of all your
favourite crashes, black flags and so on.
The graphics are very nice, with the
cars being modelled particularly nicely,
and the circuits too are neatly repre-
sented. That having been said there are
one or two corners which have clearly
been cut, particularly with the specta-
tors, who are represented by a flat panel
of blobs, the sort of thing Jackson Pollock
would have knocked out as I
a Christmas card to a friend • H H H H
he didn't particularly like. jjBJBJBJBJ
The sound is also a bit of a M W B B I
disappointment, particularly f H |
the narration. I've already
mentioned ihe lack of Mur- y i ? " 5 B ™ j P
ray Walker (who's I
replaced by someone who
sounds Australian), but more importantly
there has been little attempt to embed
the narration into the game, being lim-
ited to a few stock phrases which are slot-
ted in almost at random. Equally the
environmental sounds (engines, crowds,
etc) are all there, but seem curiously
remote. These might seem like funny
things to pick up on, but this is meant to
be a simulation, not an arcade game,
and the difference between a good sim
and a bad sim often comes down to the
details.
The driving is night-
marlshly hard; even on the
easiest of settings with all
the cheats I could find
switched on (useful things
ike no damage, automatic
braking and gear chang-
ing) I still found myself
unable to go round the
simplest of circuits without
spinning out several times.
If this is as accurate a rep-
resentation of the cars han-
dling characteristics as is
being claimed, then Schumacher (x2),
Hill, Irvine et al may deserve more
respect than I've been willing to.give
them so far. I couldn't keep on the road
when all I had to do was point the car in
the right direction -1 hate to think how
they manage it while worrying about
changing gears and doing pitstops.
All-in-all? Well, it's not bad, but the
lack of attention to the peripheral details
has damaged the game overall. I also
can't help feeling that they need to look
at their car models - they are very sensi-
tive, which might be fine for f1 drivers
and fans, but is off-putting for someone
who's less interested. If you're looking
for an FT sim which is bang up-to-date
and accurate, then this is the one to
buy. If you're looking for something a bit
more fun and a bit less anal, go for
something like Microprose's venerable
but still playable R G P - at least you'll
stand a chance of winning a race or two.
And for those of you looking for this
weeks reference to our Beloved Games
Editor -1 couldn't work it in. Sorry.

Marvel Super Heroes vs Streetfighter (PSX)
Virgin Interactive
PlayStation.
Summary:
Spidey and mates pick a fight with the
Street Fighter guys and gals.
Whats It all about:
Another beat-em-up arcade conversion
of a very special Capcom arcade game.
Basically a product of an overactive imag-
ination when some marvel comic fan
complained that the street fighter blokes
and lasses wouldn't last 30 seconds in a
fight against some real heroes. Someone
from Capcom overheard and spiderman
and wolverine get to kick cammy's elec-
tronic butt all the way across the screen.
Good Graphics:
Arcade quality graphics once again.
Almost certainly the same engine as last
week's Darkstalkers 3 beat-em-up but
with characters you will instantly recog-
nise - well anyone brought up on kids car-
toons or marvel comics in the last twenty
years will. Supposedly sixty frames a sec-
ond - they were a little too quick to count
myself so I'll believe them for once.
Seraphim
Sounds:
Standard
Neo-geo
unit bleats
and beeps.
Very retro
but not all
that good
really.
Great
Gameplay:
Being recognisable characters
with moves that match takes
the sting out of the fact that i
otherwise it is standard 2D
usual bits and pieces, individ
ual fights, team fights and T
team tag fights. Then there |
are the special moves, both
documented and undocumented, but
once again we run-up against the 2D
beat-em-up wall again. Pretty much
everything that has been done is being
done again - it is like expecting the next
racing game to
look like a high
detailed pole posi-
tion rather than
the polygon
packed Gran
Tourismo 2.
Sex and Violence:
Violence is pre-
sent, though of
the cartoon and
..... ,.
^ no blood variety -
nothing that your granny would com-
plain about - though people dressing up
in tight lycra and hitting each other hard
is a little suspect if you ask me, and def-
initely something for the home rather
than the streets, and only with a con-
senting partner.
Who will buy it:
OK, of all the 2D beat-em-ups out at the
moment this has to be one of the bet-
ter. If you really want one and you can't
wait for Street fighter Alpha 3 - reviewed
next week - this would be the one. Good
for Spiderman fans who want to see
cammy get beat badly (Kylie minogue
take that - You should be so lucky, blat,
locomate on this smash). GaryS.
