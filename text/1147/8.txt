A
Cure Quacks?
Can spiritual healing cure warts? Can acupuncture help you stop smoking? Can herbal reme-
dies cure depression? According to the WHO, 80% of the world's population would say yes,
and use alternative medicine as a primary source of healthcare. Joanna Marchant investigates...
Alternative therapies
are rapidly gaining
acceptance in the
Western world - an
estimated one third of
adults have used
them. In the past,
patients seeking
unorthodox treat-
ments were labelled
as poorly educated,
neurotic, gullible or
ignorant, but surveys
show that those seek-
ing such care are now
better educated and
more health-con-
scious than ever
before. There is a
growing belief that alternative
approaches to healthcare are safer,
healthier and more environmentally
friendly than so-called 'Western' medi-
cines.
It is easy to see the attraction. Many
alternative therapists
regard most if not all dis-
Many herbs contain active ingredients in
unknown and variable amounts, which
can cause side effects (for example
Ephedra, a "natural" slimming drug,
which causes dizziness and palpitations).
They can also interact unpredictably with
prescribed medications - an estimated
70% of patients using alternative medi-
cines do not mention them to their doc-
tors. Some alternative procedures can
also be dangerous, for example acupunc-
ture, which has been associated with
several life-threatening conditions, includ-
ing hepatitis B and HIV infections, spinal
cord injury, septicaemia and acute
asthma.
Other therapies and herbal reme-
dies do not have any effect, and a par-
ticularly worrying scenario occurs when
people use alternative therapies as a
replacement to conventional medical
treatment. There are often no regula-
tions controlling practitioners. Through
ignorance, or an eagerness to identify
the mental and emotional components
of an illness, some ther-
apists may overlook slg-
eases as potentially cur- Some alternative nificant physical

in the NHS.
But do these alternative treatments

describes, it's a very real
problem. "I examined
a Korean lady with
breast cancer", she says.
"For months she'd sim-
ply been using a herbal
paste given to her by an
alternative medicine
practitioner. By the time she came to the
doctor she was in the very late stages.
She's probably dead now". The NHS is
now moving to integrate many alterna-
tive therapies into the service, but the
basic problem remains - that most of
these treatments are not clinically proven.
There is no reasonable evidence that
they work, or that they are safe.
This situation is starting to change,
however. The Department of Comple-
mentary Medicine at the University of
Exeter was established five years ago, the
first of its kind in the world and still the
only Complementary Medcine Depart-
ment in Britain. The department aims to
conduct rigorous interdisciplinary
research into the efficacy, safety and
costs of complementary medicine. Clare
Stevinson, a research fel-
low in the department, is
organising a clinical trial
into the effectiveness of
Hypericum (a small
weed) into the treat-
ment of PMT.
"Any practitioners
who advocate the use
of untested medicines
are playing with patients'
lives", Clare said. "Here
at Exeter we carry out
scientific, randomised,
controlled trials to see
how effective these ther-
apies really are. Safety is
a primary concern."

effective in treating depression as con-
ventional medicines, and with far fewer
side effects. Other trials being con-
ducted by the department include
acupuncture for headaches and for
smoking cessation, spiritual healing for
warts, and homeopathy. There have
been many negative results, but also

ones, including acupuncture for treat-
ing postoperative nausea, and for den-
tal pain, and garlic for lowering blood
pressure. But there are problems. "One
of the main difficulties", explains Clare,
"is getting the practitioners to take part
in our trials. It is irrelevant to them
what the scientific results are - either
way they will still have
people queuing for their
therapies."
People in society
today are becoming
more and more disillu-
sioned with an orthodox
medicine that can't pro-
vide all the answers, that
uses drugs which are
seen as artificial and
which cause side
effects. Many are now
turning to the idea of a
natural cure. It Is impor-
tant for us all to realise
the danger of ignoring
the benefits of some
herbal medicines and traditional treat-
ments, but also the dangers of turning
our backs on conventional medicine in
favour of untested, anecdotal tteatments.
The best way forward for Western med-
icine is undoubtedly an integrated
approach, but only if the alternative ther-
apies are first subjected to the same rig-
orous scientific testing as conventional
drugs.
