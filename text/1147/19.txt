Spacetlme Continuum
'Double Fine Zone'
(Virgin)
Refreshingly fresh album, bringing
the very best electronic music from
Astralwerks. With influences from Her-
bie Hancock, Carl Craig and early 70's
movie soundtracks the album pushes
back the boundaries of modern elec-
tronic music. There's soul, techno, jazz
and all sorts thrown in together, mixed
and then structured carefully to produce
tracks that leave you in anticipation of
what the next track is like. Wonderfully
balanced album, made even more
impressive by how all the influences fit
together.
Out 31st May.

JR
'Lay With Me'
(Global 1)
Brilliant R&B track. The Album mix
is very vocal with a filtered beat allow-
ing the sensual vocals to come straight
at you. The Club Man mix introduces
extra vocals and a slightly different beat
but is just as smooth. The flip side has
a couple of excellent garage mixes.

FYZA
'Mad Cool'
(Global 1)
Quality fresh vocals, a subtle beat
and filtered back vocals all add up to a
serene R&B track. Oozing with funky
grooves the Album mix is smooth and
silky, the Club mix is slightly harder-
retaining the vocals but loosing the rich-
ness. The flip side has a couple of
speed garage mixes that will work won-
ders on the dancefloot.

Jackson & His Computer Band
Gourmet EP
(Sound of Barclay)
Excellent EP with the first single 'My
kind of...' fusing Chicago house and
seventies funk. With its thumping bass
lines and groow vocals this is a top
floor-filler. Following on from this is
'Moon Run' - the worst tune on the EP.
O n the flip side is 'Moon Kick', a seri-
ously good track with a jazz groove and
a great beat. Finally, there is 'Won-
derlove' - a very soulful cut with plenty
of deep bass and dulcet vocals.
Out In June.

Classen Collective
'Close To Greatness'
(JCR)
Slow groovy sounds with a mixture
of funk and jazz. It's a sweet sound -
very French house style, lhe Original
mix puts a beat to the track but retains
the fresh guitar licks, the husky vocals
and the funked up jazz groove. The flip
side mixes retain the jazz and groove,
but the beat is gentler.

Freska Allstars
'Keeping Our Hands In'
(Freskanova)
A random collection of good hip
hop, soul, seventies and Babylon Zoo
fused groove cuts from the Freska All-
stars, fhe first single is 'Get Fresh' and
is a good house track utilising the above
influences. The second single 'Keep Ihe
Faith' is an epic track with deep beats
and some random noises - very experi-
mental. The flip side has 'Watch [his
Sound' which is hip-hop vs house and
the final track is an indie tune. Strange
LP but worth checking out.
Out In June.

PHD
'Haze/ Contrast'
(Good Looking)
Good double A-side from G o o d
Looking. The first track, 'Haze' Is a min-
imalist track with subtle percussive
effects, the gentlest of melodies and a
just audible bass line. Very Mike Old-
field. The flip side is called 'Contrast' and
is a techno-tinged epic. The melody is
high pitched, the bass rumbles and the
beats add the perfect touch.
Out next w e e k

Wisdom
'Innocent World'
(Evenova)
A melodic, uplifting trance track
with huge breakdowns. The Club mix
is very epic and will impress the Renais-
sance followers whilst the Alternative
mix adds more bite with thumping
basslines and more synths. The Radio
edit isn't as g o o d as the other two
mixes.
Out next month.

Shane Morris
'Bang The Box'
(Phoenix Uprising)
This track. In collaboration with Jon
the Dentist is a thumping hard house
track. The Original mix Is an under-
ground trance tune but with plenty of
fast beats and phat bass. The flip side
has a JTD mix that is more epic and
trancey but still keeps the chunky bass
and the trademark J ID makeover.
Out next month.

Gouryella
'Gouryella'
(Codeblue)
A trance tune which mixes together
the melodic charms of Chicane and the
simplicity of DJ Sakin. 1 he Original mix
kicks off with a thumping bassline
before slowing down to the melodic
synths and then picking up again. The
Gigolo remix is exactly the same. The
Gorella mix is a faster track with a harder
bass line and the Armix version is very
Luro-housc with a long build up before
releasing the dazzling synths.
Out In June.

Andy Allder
'Mad Kebab'
(Fluff Records)
Definitely no cliches in this strong
fluff release, where one half of the
awesome D-Bop duo, Andy Allder;
brings us another record much in the
isame veiriTfiis track is full of the best
Things aboutihouse musici except for its
rather curious name.
The A-side is a stunning track, with
a bit of everything. Nice chunky tech-
noish synths kick it off, there's a great
breakdown in the middle, and after the
build up we are treated to a classic
piano-based track. All very 1995/6, which
is very good news indeed.
Out 14th June

'Feel the Beat (Check This Out)'
(Phoenix Uprising)
Look past the cliches that appear to
be everywhere in this 12". and you'll find
a couple of quite useful tracks. It really
is about time that dance music artists
moved away from using such cheesy,
throwaway lyrics as 'feel the beat' and
'throw your hands in the air'.
What saves this record from being
another run-of-the-mill release is the
music. Both tracks are nice up-beat
house builders, full of reversed beats,
crowd noises, and interesting break-
downs. However, the music isn't that
great, and when put together with the
mindless lyrics, you can't really get away
from the feeling that you are dealing
with a couple of set-fillers that wouldn't
be the highlight of any crowd's night
out.
Out June 14th
