CRICKET-1st XI
Imperial cruise into Semis
by Gus Paul
The IC 1st XI cruised into the semi finals
of the ULU Cup with a crushing 128 run
victory over LSE last Wednesday. O n a
sunny afternoon at Harlington, IC, put
into bat by LSE, racked up an impressive
229 for 7.
Top scores from Jawwad Rasheed
(69), who again dominated the bowling
before being forced to retire with a knee
injury, and keeper John Williams (48)
gave IC a good total to bowl at. LSE did-
n't help themselves by dropping 5
catches, and IC scored 80 runs in the last
TO overs, Nick Holt with a particularly
aggressive 24 off 13 balls, despite one of
the LSE bowlers taking 3 wickets in 4
balls.
LSE had trouble with the Imperial
opening attack and both openers
scratched around before Murali (2-20)
got them out. The middle order were
kept tied down to 3 runs an over, but
Adam Uttley (2-7) and Jawwad (3-19),
capping a great all round performance,
rushed the rest of the team out cheaply
and tSE were all out for 101. IC looked
quite comfortable against some bowling
that, with a couple of exceptions, was
fairly ordinary, and some athletic fielding,
particularly by Jon Ainsworth on the
boundary, underlined ICs superiority.
The firsts can now look forward to an
away semi-final against either last year's
finalists Royal Holloway, or a rematch
from the group stages against Bart's.
The seconds, meanwhile completed
their season a couple of weeks ago with
a victory over Kings 1st XI. The depth of
the squad is show by the fact that they
have last year's first team captain
amongst their ranks. The win, believed
to be the first time the IC 2nds has
beaten a firsts team, was enough to
knock a powerful King's team out of the
competition.
IC 229/7 (Rasheed 69) v
LSE 101 (Rasheed 3-19)

FOOTBALL
Southside thump Union in football
On a sunny afternoon of Sunday 23rd
May, Southside and Union armies met at
Hyde Park ready for this mouth-watering
battle.
A slightly less serious girls match kicked
off first, which was pretty much dominated
by the Union and their star player Marie.
The Union won 5-1, but Helen grabbed a
consolation for Southside, blasting home
a free-kick from all of about twenty yards
which would surely have broken the net
had there been one. This was a great spec-
tacle, rounded off by the players exchang-
ing shirts after the final whistle.
Next came the main event, the men
took to the field. Early indications were that
this was going to be a rough and tough
affair, as Southside's Craig had to retire
from the game after just one minute with
a knock on the nose - I thought you were
from the North East son? Also, seconds
after this a soft Union geezer went down
after receiving a knee to the testicles, much
to the Southside supporters delight. 'Ref
had to blow his whistle for fouls many
more times.
The deadlock was broken when South-
side gained a free-kick about thirty yards
out. Super Nick ran up and curled a fine
shot into the top left corner, sending play-
ers and fans alike wild. Despite Southside
defending like lions, one instance of slack
marking allowed the Union to equalise.
However, they bounced back superbly
when Warren rose to head in - this was the
man who had won the feague this season
with the IC 1 st team finishing as top scorer
and who scored a hat-trick in the famous
cup final victory.
So at halftime Southside were leading
2-1. The second was similar to the first -
fast, furious and dirty. The union squan-
dered opportunities to score and so did
Warren who played poorly. However, the
match was wrapped up well and truly
when Southside's sweeper Soso added a
third with only a few minutes remaining.
When 'Ref blew his whistle for full-time it
was shear carnage, and the celebration
were to continue well into the evening
back at THE bar - that's Southside Bar.
The Union won a boat race drinking con-
test but I'm sure they must have cheated
somehow!
