O DWELLS BEHIND THE MAJESTIC WALLS
W e l l to begin with L a d y Flowers is
a very friendly woman w h o m y o u feel
you could chat to for ages, she also
makes very good Turkish coffee, though
Sir Brian I was told is the real expert.
Lady Flowers likes people a n d shows
it. A great deal of her life has been
spent doing voluntary social work. B e -
fore coming here, while living i n Isling-
ton, she worked for the 'Family Service
Unit' and also for the 'National Asso-
ciation for Mental Health'. This was
while S i r Brian was chairman of the
Science Research Council. She worked
to prevent the splitting u p of families
i n : one case and to bring a greater
understanding of mental disorders i n
the other.
Naturally L a d y Flowers is well aware
of the stresses and strains which we
poor, overworked students are subject
to and is very concerned. Being a very
sensitive person, who has at time suf-
fered depression a n d loneliness, she
realises the problems of people around
her, and tries to help. W o r k i n g with
the telephone Samaritans was another
work which she found very taxing
emotionally. Perhaps it was as a re-
action t o the misery and depression
which she had come across, that she at
one point became a model. Being older
than most models she seemed to have
the knack of matching clothes, natur-
ally, a n d eventually drifted into train-
ing models. H e r new customers with
their many and varied wardrobes were
a long way away from the women who
had never h a d more than one outfit.
Their continued a n d expensive fight
with obesity h a d nothing i n common
with the struggle of the others. But, she
enjoyed modelling a n d thinks that the
clothes consciousness which she ac-
quired will never leave her, nor will her
good posture.
L a d y Flowers makes her o w n clothes,
for her the achievement of making
something outweighs the gratification
which most women get out of buying
an expensive dress.
W i t h this background what does she
feel about the w a y girl students dress?
She likes the liberalness of the clothes,
though she feels (they could be a little
neater. But a compliment to a l l girls at
the I C W A Dinner, she thinks y o u were
very smartly dressed, she especially
Sir Brian plays the cello, a n d Lady
Flowers the piano (in private). She has
always been a great concert
goer, and enjoys jazz a n d dancing. H e r
greatest pleasure is Ito listen to radio 3,
while doing her cooking, always giving
it her personal touch. I n answer to m y
question about her literary aspirations,
she showed me a long row of cookery
books i n many languages a n d from
many more lands. She reads them in
bed for inspiration.
L a d y Flowers was born i n a middle
Class family i n Manchester, and still re-
members the servants i n her grand-
mother's house, who lived i n the attic,
had an outside lavatory a n d always
presented things on trays. H e r father
is the well-known liberal S i r Leonard
Behrens. H e ran for parliament twice.
LADY FLOWERS
liked the Laura Ashley clothes.
L a d y Flowers' sense of colour carries
over to her kitchen a n d her paintings.
She is good at putting colours together,
in contrast to Sir Brian who is predict-
ably more preoccupied with technical
problems i n paintings like representing
glass o n canvas, cylindrical shapes and
creases o n a well-worn pair of shoes!
T o d o h i m justice, he did have a rather
good portrait of his sister o n the easel
in his studio.
unsuccessfully, but nonetheless never
lost his deposit. L a d y Flowers of course
took a view to the left of her father
and became a Marxist. She thinks
M a r x a n d Engels make good reading
but the revolutionary zeal of her
younger days has watered down. She
has visited the U S S R , Czechoslovakia,
Poland, and has been disillusioned per-
haps by the closed society of the C o m -
munist countries. She was very i m -
pressed by the re-building and public
services i n East Berlin a n d by the
achievements of Tito i n his non aligned
policy.
Regarding British politics she is a
mild Socialist a n d would like to see a
lot of alterations, though without a
revolution. Although she has seen the
great misery a n d poverty o f many
people, she feels sorry that they have to
resort to strike action and does not sup-
port the extreme position of some
trades unions. She is a floating voter
but has only voted Conservative once,
never to repeat it.
Lady Flowers has not had time to
sort out the tangle of political opinion
at I C yet though like every Fresher she
has been bombarded with bumph. I
told her about the exciting battles
waged i n F E L I X , C E F E , B R O A D -
S H E E T etc., a n d she said she would
catch u p over the weekend. G o o d luck
to her!
A t present Lady Flowers is occupied
with the various organisations she has
to deal with, like the I C wives club of
which she is chairman. She has to learn
a lot of names and is finding out who
everyone is and h o w everything works.
This of course includes I C U a n d the
C C U ' s . She is interested i n meeting the
students and has got i n touch with
Norm. Sayles a n d Anne Short to ar-
range cocktail parties a n d of course
like every other fresher she has realised
the difficulty of having a well balanced
gathering with the chronic shortage of
girls.
Are we studying anything Meaningful ?
H o w d o we know if the subjects we
study are obsolete or meaningless?
Let's look at some of the problems of
applying o u r I.C. acquired knowledge
during our working life.
a) Energy resources
Britain is a n import-export country
who cannot feed herself out of her o w n
land (at least under present conditions)
in spite of using more than one calorie
of fuel to obtain each calorie of food.
For this reason it is important not only
to know whether or not Britain will
have fuel i n the next decades but also
to know whether or not the countries
importing costly high-fuel-consuming
British-made machinery and products,
will have fuel a n d money enough for
the imports to make any sense to them.
There are obviously very serious
foreseeable difficulties with o i l supplies,
be it i n the next few years o r i n the
'80's o r '90's. T h e same applies to coal,
especially i n other countries. Nuclear
power does not seem to promise any-
thing significant, given the size and
proximity of the energy problem.
Less fuel abroad means less planes
coming to Britain, less tourists leaving
their foreign currencies, less high-fuel-
consuming British-made machinery, less
high-fuel-consuming civil engineering
British contracts abroad, etc.
b) Pollution
There are two kinds of increasing
pollution problems brought about by
industrialisation a n d "progress". 1 —
, The higher levels of pollution due to i n -
creasing numbers and concentration of
machines, apparatus, etc., from the
river polluting factory to o u r neigh-
bour's noisy electric shaver that also
interferes our radio reception; 2 — T h e
normal desire of people to relatively
improve their environment.
T o sOlve these problems the obvious
way out is to produce less, down to the
necessary level. This implies such
taboos as reducing the G.N.P. and the
growth of large corporations and
monopolies, etc., so that only a few
non-industrialised nations are likely to
adopt this policy i n the near future.
The second policy, the one adopted by
industrial nations, is to produce anti-
pollution devices and gadgets (the pro-
duction of which causes more pollution)
at the expense of general increases i n
costs. T h e first pa£cy means for
Britain, less exports of high-energy-
consuming machinery a n d techniques
and less exports of products i n general.
The second one means, ever higher
prices of products that can only be
afforded by an ever-reducing number of
people (until inflation allows it) as well
as increasing demands for energy and
resources in general. ( G O TO' a).
c) Growth of population and G N P
plus inflation mean shortages and
higher costs of basic resources such as
land, food, housing, etc., which are the
things that Britain either lacks or has
to import. A t the same time these
shortages divert the interests of the
consumers of British industrial pro-
ducts towards the more basic needs
both here a n d abroad. F o r example,
overpopulation plus increased need for
space for factories, mines, roads, air-
ports, etc., means world-wide prices i n -
crease, and hence less spare money for
T V s , cars, machinery and other typical
British produdts, both home and
abroad. Also, the problems just men-
tioned worsen the above-mentioned
ones.
( G O T O a. O R b.)
A t I.C. we learn h o w to invent, de-
sign a n d build these highly sophisti-
cated, costly, Mgh-energy-consuming
, products that contribute to a l l these
troubles.
A l l these problems will come well
within o u r working life: Petrol ration-
ing was a reality i n the U.S. even be-
fore the Middle East war; petrol ration-"
ing due to political reasons is a reality
now, and so are the pdtrol price rises;
tendencies towards self sufficiency and
low energy consumption are a reality
now in some countries; escalating land
prices, over population a n d housing
shortages are a world wide reality to-
day a n d so are rising levels and costs
of pollution.
Whey then are we compelled to study
high - energy - consuming technology
(with planned obsolesence) assessed
only by traditional economics (if at all)
without taking a l l these problems into
account?
One of the reasons is that we have
been streamed into highly fragmented
fields, in order to achieve high levels of
specialisation, thus not getting to know
much even about neighbouring fields,
let alone ithe social, ecological and
poliitcal implications of o u r studies or
even why should we reach high levels
of specialisation or w h y should we pur-
sue this type of science and technology.
Another reason is that we didn't
have much choice anyway; we had to
"choose" from among a G I V E N num-
ber of pre-packaged approved fields of
study (if we wanted to get a degree
and a "good job", that is).
Have y o u heard of low energy tech-
nology? Alternative technology? Tech-
nology assessment? Non-industrial
technology? Science for people? These
are S O M E ways by which people are
trying to face the real problems of to-
day and tomorrow, rather than "plan-
ning for a future" which is nothing
but an extrapolation of the past a n d
hoping to solve the problems with a n
expansion of our obsolete remedies.
But are we allowed to study such
things at I.C., with recognition and get-
ting a degree? . . .
