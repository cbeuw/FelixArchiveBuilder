Materialism
v
Idealism
Sir,
F r o m your editorials it
appears that you have one
fixed solution Ito a l l prob-
lems that m a y arise i n any
situation — to build the
revolutionary party.
When I was at school i n
Ireland we were also given
one fixed solution to solve
all problems — to look
to the (Catholic) Church.
What's the difference?
Yours sincerely,
Kathleen Corcoran.
EDITOR'S
REPLY
This, and your previous
letter both come d o w n i n t h e
last analysis to a question o f
epistemology. Philosophy i s
s p l i t into two great c a m p s —
t h e idealist's who assert t h a t
thought 'is primary 'to m a t t e r
and the materialists who s a y
'that ideas arise out o f t h e
material world i n -some way.
If you subscribe to Ithe for-
mer, then .end of correspon-
dence for your arguments will
reduce to a question o f g o d -
given morality, a n d y o u r
political position t o one o f
fervent reaction.
The '©arly materialists as-
sented that changes i n ideas
came about f r o m 'changes i n
the material world, b u t o f
course could not explain t h e
source of changes i n Ithe
material world, a n d ascribed
it (like the idealists i n e x -
plaining the source o f
changes of ideas ' d i d 'to a
god or 'third f o r c e iof s o m e
kind) to some c o n s t a n t l a w
of Nature—it just works t h a t
way!
These 'mechanical m a t e r i a l -
i s t s were j u s t a n o t h e r f o r m
of philosophical i d e a l i s t s , i n
having to l o o k outside t h e

ENTS
Dear Ali,
I should like to clear
up a few misunderstand-
ings which may have
arisen out of the 'Felix'
coverage of the U G M of
October 16th regarding
the 'Ents Motion'.
Firstly, the council
motion of last term was
amendment was pro-
posed to allow Ents a
little more freedom than
the (amended) Council
Motion originally sug-
gested. John Lane's
amendment did not pur-
port to "increase the
number of 'large
groups' to four per
term"; it restricted the
number of optional ex-
tra concerts to one,
the overall effect being
to limit the number of
"large concerts" to four
per term.
Your reporter has
also grossly misinter-
preted the original
Council motion. It was
passed, not " . . . . to
ensure Ents cater for a
wider range of tastes",
but rather, and I quote,
that "I.C. Ents run
events to consist of
Weekly Hops combining
the Friday disco and a
'danceable' band. This
to be run on Fridays or
Saturdays as a social
event in the Union (Con-
cert Halt) . . . No big
concerts in the Great
Hall in the first term" (A
subsequent amendment
a l t e r e d " N o " to
"Three").
At the time this mo-
tion was passed Ents
had already been run-
ning films for a term.
The "Folk Groups"
(i.e. Ralph McTell, pre-
sumably) this term,
hardl yqualify under the
above stipulation and
are, for the time being
at least, being planned
independently of both
the "Three Concert
Limit" and Ents. The
motivation to cater for
a wider range of tastes
has always existed in
Ents and was not influ-
enced by Council.
The attendance at
Tuesday's Osibisa con-
cert suggests to me at
least that plenty of I.C.
students are interested
in what Ents is doing.
So can I encourage
everyone who is inter-
SOUP RUN
For the past year ICCAG have been d o i n g a
soup run to Charing Cross and surrounding
areas. This happens each Wednesday and Fri-
day night and involves taking soup and bread to
people who for various reasons have nowhere
to go a n d are sleeping on the streets.
These are the p e o p l e who have slipped t h r o u g h
the net of the welfare state in what is meant
to be a c a r i n g and c o m p a s s i o n a t e society. Very
often the only alternative to the street is a l o u s e d
up Salvation Army Hostel o r a vast i m p e r s o n a l
G o v e r n m e n t R e c e p t i o n Centre, I k n o w which I
w o u l d c h o o s e . M o s t of the people at C h a r i n g
C r o s s have s o c i a l p r o b l e m s of o n e sort o r a n -
other, s o m e have m e d i c a l problems, while yet
others a r e purely a n d simply h o m e l e s s . This
m a k e s them u n a b l e to d r a w S o c i a l Security,
thereby creating a n u n a v o i d a b l e v i c i o u s c i r c l e .
S o what c a n w e a s students d o about it all?
T h e most important a c h i e v e m e n t is to m a k e per-
sonal c o n t a c t with s o m e of t h e " d o s s e r s " who
so many p e o p l e just p a s s b y a n d ignore. It is
surprising how q u i c k l y individual relationships
develop, e s p e c i a l l y for those w h o d o s o u p run
on a regular basis.
A s well a s s h o w i n g that w e at least d o c a r e
a n d c o n s i d e r it a s c a n d a l a n d a n outrage that i n
our society there a r e p e o p l e s l e e p i n g o n the pave-
ment in front of s h o w r o o m s h o u s i n g c a r s , we
must a i m to heighten p e o p l e ' s a w a r e n e s s a n d
rouse their c o n s c i e n c e s . If p u b l i c o p i n i o n was
sufficiently strong this a p p a l l i n g situation w o u l d
no longer b e tolerated a n d s o m e t h i n g w o u l d
have to b e done. It is p e o p l e ' s attitudes that
we must try to c h a n g e — after all it c o u l d hap-
pen to a n y o n e of u s . It's easy to e n d u p o n t h e
street, but not s o easy to get b a c k off it.
Well, this is what S o u p R u n is a l l about —
just s e e i n g a n d talking to people. It doesn't
take m u c h — w e a r e all h u m a n .

12th of November. This
involves decorating the
homes of people, usually
old people, i n the W l l

ested in being entertain-
ed to bring any helpful
suggestions to Ents. We
shan't be booking Led
Zeppelin or The Who or
Pink Floyd this term or
next term or ever, but
if anyone wants to know
why, or can suggest any
other way we could
work better, there'll al-
ways be someone from
Ents in the Union Office
(or in the Room at the
Top, when we get our
external phone re-con-
nected) at lunchtimes,
who will discuss any
suggestions.
Ents exists not for the
benefit of its members
but for the student body
as a whole . . . nuff said.

India's human calculating
machine
SHAKUNTALA DEVI
S H A K U N T A L A D E V I was born in Bangalore,
India in 1946. When she was three, she had a revela-
tion that she was a mathematical genius. The revela-
tion proved to be true, and even now, at the age of
32, she is baffling everybody with her mathematical!
prowess.
A t six, Shakuntala demonstrated her 'talents ait the
University of Mysore to a large gathering of students
and professors of the University. T h e little girl
worked out the most complicated arithmetical mani-
pulations with 'lightning rapidity and scientific pre-
cision, and kept the assembly astounded for two
hours.
Shakuntala who later displayed her talents to
people all over India came to be acclaimed as a child
prodigy.
In London, o n October 5th, 1950 the B B C present-
ed Shakuntala on T V . She gave quick answers to prob-
lems set b y the B.B.C. She also gave a presentatfon
at Leeds University the next day.
A t ithe University of Rome, one of her answers
was found to be wrong by the calculating machine.
After re-checking i t was found that the calculator
had gone berserk.
In Washington,. D.C., the party of reporters and.
mathematics professors who witnessed Iher demon-
stration i n July 1952 were completely baffled. T h e
audience of D a n Seymour's " W e the People" T V show
in N e w Y o r k witnessed Shakuntala compete with a n
electronic calculator a n d w i n b y six seconds. She
appeared o n other shows i n the U.S.A.
Shakuntala also toured South America a n d the F a r
East. I n Japan she appeared o n the N i p p o n Tele-
vision Network, a n d i n Cambodia she gave a per-
formance before H . H . the K i n g of Cambodia.
I n Sydney, Australia, Shakuntala matched her wits
against a n £80,000 electronic brain " U T E C O M " o f
the University of South Wales. Seconds before the
complete question could be fed into " U T E C O M " ,
Shakuntala h a d the answers. " I t is frightening!" re-
marked one of the professors present.
Shakuntala Devi has toured most of the countries
except Russia and China and some in Eastern Europe.
Nowadays, she is i n Britain. Recently she appeared,
on T V and also featured in ithe daily newspapers.
She has challenged any computer o r calculator to
a match of mathematical ability, while she is i n
Britain. H e r record to date: Extracting Ithe 20th
root of a 42 digit number and multiplying figures
that yielded- a 39 digit answer. Simple sums don't
take any time at all. B y "simple" she means calculat-
ing cube and fourth roots, etc.! She said modestly to
the Daily M i r r o r : " F o r big problems like finding the
10th root of a 40-figure digit I have to concentrate
hard a n d it might take u p to 30 seconds to answer"..
Recently, the Sunday Times put her to the test,
They took her to the accounts department, where
there was a very bright girl with a deft hand o n an.
electronic calculator. Shakuntala Devi w o n each time
because her answers to a series of extensive addition,
multiplication a n d division were just about instan-
taneous; their girl hadn't h a d time to get them o n
the machine. There was no competition when i t came
to finding a fourth root: the machine couldn't d o it.
Shakuntala took three seconds.
Such a display of brilliance is hardly credible.
Nevertheless, it is true. Y o u too can witness the
wizards at work. Shakuntala will be appearing at
Imperial College (Great Hall), on November 8th,
1973, at 7.30 p.m. on invitation from I.C. India Soc,
Admission will be lOp. A l l are welcome.
Further information may be obtained from:
M . Bhadresha, Elec. Eng. 3;
or P. Chakrabarety, Chem. Eng. P G ;
or J . P. Singh, Mech. Eng. 3.
Please bring solved problems and verify the
answers yourself. Any complicated arithmetical prob-
lems welcome.
