London, October 2 5 — A new Electro-
nic Revolution, impinging upon virtu-
ally every form of human activity, has
begun amplifying the power of the
mind just as the Industrial Revolution
amplified the power of muscle, R C A
Chairman Robert W , Sarnoff said here
today.
" T h e result through the rest of this
century will be a fundamental and
growing shift i n patterns of working
and living," he said. " A growing varie-
ty of inexpensive, compact and versa-
tile devices will perform the menial
tasks of the mind—calculating, remem-
bering, searching for references, mea-
suring risks and opportunities — the
whole variety of non-creative activities
that precede decision or creation."
In ah address at the Commemora-
tion Day Ceremony of the Imperial
College of Science and Technology, at
which he was named an Honorary Fel-
low, M r . Sarnoff said the Electronic
Revolution is based on new solid-state
devices employing microscopically
small integrated circuits that contain
thousands of electronic elements in the
tiny space of a few square millimetres.
B y . 1980, he predicted, such circuits
containing a million elements will be
mass-produced so cheaply that their
use will involve practically no cost pet-
function, and made so precisely that
they will be almost infinitely reliable.
"The Industrial Revolution took
more than a century to gather full mo-
mentum. The Electronic Revolution
may do so in the next two decades."
he said. " I n contrast to its predecessor,
it will be silent, and it will create nei-
ther environmental pollution nor urban
blight. In fulfilling its modest require-

ments for material and energy, we
shall not have to plunder our planet.
"The Industrial Revolution tended
to subordinate the individual to the or-
ganisation even as it multiplied hum-
an physical capabilities, productivity
and material wealth. The Electronic
Revolution will shape electronics into a
personal tool of universal application.
It will compress a multitude of systems
and devices — with the energy to run

them — into packages small enough to
carry in the hand."
M r . Sarnoff said the new revolution
will touch on every function of sensing,
control, communication and informa-
tion processing — "indeed, just about
every kind of work now performed by
people or machines except generating
power or propelling vehicles."
The R C A Chairman cited examples
of the impact of the Electronic Revolu-
tion on the individual, education, the
management of public and private en-
terprise and the progress of undevelop-
sd nations:
— M a n a g e m e n t . Small desk-top intel-
\ gent terminals will enable a manager
to obtain instant data retrieval from a
computer, or to communicate with col-
leagues via a two-way television unit.
These and other electronic devices will
make day-to-day decision making simp-
ler and will free top management from
less detailed supervision and permit
more emphasis on creative planning and
policy-making.
— T h e Home. The new technology
will transform the domestic scene and
provide a multitude of attractive and
convenient services, including a com-
prehensive home information system
linking the household in two-way com-
munications with people institutions and
computers in practically any part of the
world.
—Education. With large-scale integ-
ration and the development of compact
personal systems, the learning process
can be freed of physical limitations. The
individual pocket computer, the desk-
top interactive terminal and wideband
communications can give the student in-
stant access to stored knowledge any-
where, making the classroom a place
used exclusively for group discussion
and intellectual stimulation.
—Underdeveloped Areas. A s the new
technology reduces the cost and com-
plexity of handling information in
great quantity and varied forms, its
products will fall increasingly within
the reach of developing nations—their
schools, public agencies, business and
even individuals. In effect, the Electron-
ic Revolution can enable more than
half of mankind to catch up with the
Industrial Revolution.
M r . Sarnoff said the new electronicst
may be "our last, best hope to develop
an open, humanist society and to avoid
either locking step in a standardized
tecnological world or drifting toward
greater fragmentation and ultimate
chaos."
"If we succeed this time in coupling
a fundamental advance in technology
with human, social, cultural and econo-
mic needs," he concluded, "we shall
achieve the greatest and most benefi-
cent revolution of a l l . "

IC BROAD
LEFT STATEMENT
It is becoming increasingly clear that
Imperial College U n i o n is facing a cri-
sis of leadership. The attempt by some
members of the U n i o n to prevent the
organisation of any actions on grants
this term and the ineffectiveness of the
refectory prices campaign are but two
symptoms of a wider malaise, the ap-
pearance, not so much of apathy but
of irrationality in the U n i o n ; the ten-
dency to oppose motions or actions
simply because the left has proposed
them; to sabotage rather than argue
against; to in effect propose no action
on urgent issues, which face students.
A n d prominent figures in the U n i o n
hierarchy have supported this trend.
Paradoxically, the majority at Union
meetings have continued to vote for the
policies proposed by the left and, as
on prices, have adopted the most mili-
tant form of action suggested — but
without the commitment needed to
make it a success. The activists who
have tried to implement union policy
have been a small minority, our mili-
tancy may have publicised the issues to
students, but it has not persuaded them
to join in and turn minority militancy
into majority militancy. Clearly a
major rethink of our approach is neces-
sary.
We believe that the fault does not lie
in the policies of the left (and I.C. Uni-
on) but in a lack of strategy which has
led to tactics which have failed to win
the massive student support which suc-
cess requires. O u r fundamen-
tal aim must be to win
wide support for our policies, it is
necessary to foster a greater under-
standing of the issues faced by students
and must be our primary task and
to win the support, and participa-
tion, of the majority of students, in ac-
tions to achieve the Unions! aims. Prac-
tice has refuted the idea that the mass
of students are like an explosive, to be
detonated by the actions of a militant
handful. But neither is it simply a ques-
tion of "Better communication." Stu-
dents must themselves be involved in
actions. If less militant mass actions are
successful in getting support but fail to
win our demands, the commitment, un-
derstanding and. perhaps, most impor-
tant, confidence in the U n i o n , will have
been created for more militant action.
T o give this sort of leadership, to the
best of our ability, we propose to form
a Broad Left grouping in I.C. Union,
with similar policies to the Broad Left
in N.U.S. which has been responsible
for the leftward shift there, in recent
years, and in many other Student U n i -
ons, eg. Sussex, Cambridge, which
manage to combine left policies with
the active involvement of the majority
of students.
(1) The most importance issues of
the last few years have been the de-
fence of student unions and the fight
against inflation, whether for higher
grants and demonstrating rates or
against price rises. Militant mass action
has been at least partially successful at
both local and national level. B u t we
do not propose to concern ourselves
solely with the economic issues. One is-
sue of concern to all students which the
left has sadly neglected, is academic af-
fairs — what we are taught, how we are
assessed. In particular we must take a
critical look at the increasing influence
of the profit motive in determining
what we are taught and the research we
do.
(2) Students are badly in need of re-
liable allies. M a n y of the issues which
face us, inflation, housing, defence of
unions etc., are faced equally and often
more so by working people. The basis
for unity exists if we work for it. B u t
not just through socialists students help-
ing workers struggles but in a way
which involves large numbers of ordin-
ary students and workers eg through a
joint campaign for grants which do not
exclude) working class children from
higher education (as N.U.S. suggest).

(3) We welcome the increasing wil-
lingness of student union and N U S to
express collective views on wider issues
eg racialism, the environment, South
Africa. This is particularly relevant in a
college with such a large percentage of
overseas students. We believe that I.C.
Union should support not just our fel-
low students in other countries but their
fellow countrymen against colonial or
neo-colonial regimes.
In all these policies, our aim is to get
m a x i m u m support while keeping to our
principal beliefs.
Unfortunately, when tactics have
been proposed which could have star-
ted to involve the majority of students
they have been directly opposed by or-
ganised groups in I.C. as was the case
when the proposal to launch a massive
petition campaign on prices to be de-
livered by a mass demonstration to the
Governing Body, was defeated at the
last U G M . Similarly, the policies of
N U S are rarely argued for, in this U n i -
on, because of hostility from both the
right and sections of the left.
In launching a Broad Left grouping
which involves students from inside and
outside the Socialist Society in I C we
are in no way counterposing it to Social-
ist Society. Its value as a F o r u m re-
mains and, on policy, much unity ex-
ists, although on strategy and tactics
we differ. N o r do we claim to be over-
coming the sectarianism of the left—
no doubt some people will be quite
