Star* /or Lacrosse Club
Imperial College Lacrosse C l u b began
the season In style last Saturday with a
15—2 away w i n over Cambridge. D e -
spite last minute additions the team put
up a n overpowering display With Pete
Drury and Steve M o r r i s contributing the
bulk of *he goals, collecting five a n d
four respectively.
O f the new players M i c k L a w m a n
showed that he was a n ideal replace-
ment i n midfield for P a u l " W h i z z K i d * '
Spooner, recently transferred to the first
division, a n d P a u l Jepson i n defence
kept his attacker very quiet.
The game was marred by one unfor-
tunate incident when Tony Hahett, who
has been reading too many coaching
manuals, tried a backwards, over-the-
shoulder Shot a n d a Cambridge player
unwittingly used his head to check the
cross. H e took no further part i n the
match and under the gentlemanly laws
of lacrosse Pete M c D o n a l d , w h o h a d
been doing some truly startling forehand
volleys i n a style reminiscent of Stan
Smith, kept h i m entertained o n the
touchline, no doubt with witty anec-
dotes about life at Imperial College.
Despite the score it was a hard match
with the m a i n differences between the
teams coming from a n 80 per cent suc-
cess rate from Ithe face gained by the
Imperial College midfield, players, the
newly discovered (for lacrosse) tactic
of an overlapping defender Which com-
pletely bemused the Cambridge defence
and the goalkeeping of I a n Gulliford
(which almost goes without saying!).
Team:—Ian Gulliford, P a u l Jepson,
B o b Strangeway, Pete Drury, N i c k L a w -
man, L i o n e l Clarke, Pete M c D o n a l d ,
Steve Norris, A l a n , Tony Hallett (capt.).

The 20th was a truly
memorable day. Firstly the
Left A n k l e of the Cross
Country C l u b (Ian Isher-
wood) made his first ap-
pearance of the year i n
the same manner as
George Best (i.e. with no
great glare of publicity
and several inches extra
in girth), and did extreme-
ly well' considering his 6
months lack of training.
A n d then there was the
amazing way i n which
people found themselves
suddenly included in, and
then just as suddenly ex-
cluded from the first team
for this " U C " Relay
at Parliament H i l l .
This was because of
the eleventh hour arrival
of three star competitors.
They were theoretically
late because R o b and P a d
had decided that the race
would start at 2.30: how-
ever U C were unaware of
this a n d planned to start
at 3, though ithey actually
managed it somewhat
later, which just goes to
show . . .
The course was 6 laps
of just under 2 miles of
ithe usual Parliament H i l l
terrain. 33 teams finished;
here are O u r Results:—
1. 17 R i c h Garnett
2. 16 R o b Allinson
3. 20 I a n Ellis
4. 20 J . S. K a l i r a y

Nobody fell down the
hill at the start, a n d no
one tad to walk up the
hill at the end . . . they
daren't with the rest of
combined I C teams cheer-
ing (jeering) them o n from
the top of the hill. Note
the incredibly brave (fool-
hardy) second leg by Ian
Ellis.

I received a complaint this week
about the bicycle racks at electrical en-
gineering. A s a follow-up to this I had a
look at the bicycle racks i n college and
found that the rack near the post-office
in Imperial Institute R o a d had quite a
number of empty spaces. F o r (those o f
you used to using only one rack there
are racks a t a) the rear of Physics,
b) the base of Blee E n g . c) near the
post-office, d) at the rear of Chemistry.
