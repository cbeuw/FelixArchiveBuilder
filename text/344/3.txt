Student Housing Protest
Grows
Throughout the country, student unions have been
staging protests over their accommodation or lack of
St. T h e protests have one common theme: that the
Government has allowed student numbers to expand
without making any provision at a l l for finding the
students somewhere t o live, a n d without providing
a grant b i g enough to pay for the accommodation
that isn't there anyway. Students are not calling on
•he Government to slow down the rate o f expansion
of higher education: that would be an intolerable be-
trayal. N o r are they asking the Government to find
Students somewhere to live i n preference to finding
non-students somewhere to live; the Government's
responsibility, Which it has consistently refused to
face, is to all people, students included, Who are pro-
hibited under its income controls from earning enough
to pay the prices charged under its Housing Finance
Act.
•Cambridge Technical College students are occupy-
ing Owlstone H a l l o f Residence, which would pro-
vide 150 good, modern study-bedrooms f o r C a m -
bridge Tech's students, a n d solve its accom-
modation problem—but which has been empty for
three years. It used to be a nurses home, but i n 1970
the Department of Health and Social Security offered
it t o Cambridge Technical College, a n d then a few
weeks later withdrew the offer, saying they wished
to pull it down, and build a hospital management
training centre. It has lain empty ever since, until
homeless students from Cambridge Technical College
occupied it last week. T h e D.H.S.S. are now ready to
reverse their original decision and leave the building
standing.
*Sussex University students have just ended a n
occupation of their administrative block. M a n y Sussex
students live a long w a y away, since accommodation
in Brighton and Lewes has become expensive and
hard t o find. They were demanding that the Univer-
sity should make u p the difference between what is
allowed in the grant for board and lodging and what
the students were actually having to pay. The -Univer-
sity has now agreed.
Teesside College of Education students have just
finished occupying half their College—the half which
was due to be pulled down last Monday. T h e C o l -
lege, and the students, were told that they had just
one week to pull out and allow a development com-
pany to build o n the site. Instead of pulling out, they
occupied; and the caretakers refused to do overtime
to move the College possessions out of the threatened
half of the building. They have now moved out, and
although the building is still t o be pulled down, they
have forced the local authority to provide temporary
accommodation for the displaced parts of the col-
lege.
Sympathetic vice-chancellors
O n Monday, 12th October the Committee of Vice
Chancellor's stated their concern that unless some-
thing was done about student grants only the wealthy
would be able to go to university.
The Vice-Chancellors are concerned that the prin-
ciple set down b y the Anderson Committee i n 1960
is being eroded. This committee reported that grants
should be available to cover the reasonable basic
maintenance costs of first degree students. T h e Vice-
Chancellors said that the "Governments have begun
to threaten this principle by fixing grants which fall
short of basic living costs".
They expressed particular concern at the current
cost of housing for students. They say that universities
must be able to fix rents i n halls of residence at a
level which students can afford. T h e V i c e Chancel-
lors are obviously worried that many students i n
halls of residence have to pay more for board and
lodging than is allocated i n the grant. Students
reacted to these high charges last year b y refusing
to pay their rent.
The Committee of Vice Chancellors will make their
views known to the D E S while the review o f grants
for the next three years is underway. They want stud-
ent grants to be fixed initially at realistic levels and
want grants to be supplemented annually to take
account of changing prices.
The Vice Chancellors m a y feel sympathetic to the
students' predicament but it does not seem that they
are going to regard rent strikes with any sympathy.
The university heads regard rent strike action as mis-
conceived. They say that it "wastes time and money
on conflicts which are not created b y universities and
• which are not in their power to resolve."
Several recent incidents show that they may be
preparing to take a hard line over the rent strike
issue. H a r r y K a y , the V i c e Chancellor at Exeter
University was asked b y Peter Smart, President o f
J the Students' U n i o n to address a meeting o f first year
; students. It had been agreed before the meeting that
it would be simply a welcoming speech. However,
M r . Kay, after expressing his delight at seeing rows
of new faces, then proceeded to tell them that rent
strikes were not a good thing and hoped that they
would not themselves think o f participating i n one.
A l e c Merrison, Vice Chancellor o f Bristol Univer-
sity, has been using the university news letter to warn
students against rent strikes.
Students take over
Music School
A number o f Manchester students are squatting i n
the old College of M u s i c situated near the University
Union building. T h e property previously housed the
Royal Northern College of Music which has since
moved to a £1 million complex near the University
Precinct Centre.
The squatters hope to develop the buildings as a n
overspill for activities o f the University Union. A t
the moment it is providing much needed temporary
accommodation for students who have- been unable
to find anywhere to live.
The Principal of the M u s i c College, A i r Commo-
dore Vaughan, said i n reaction to the squat that the
building is to stand for two years at least and is still
used for occasional music practice. T h e city planners
have said that they want to pull the building down
by Christmas to make way for a car park.
When the squat first began the university threat-
ened to evict the students, but this no longer seerns
likely. A group o f the squatters a n d student union
officers from the university met representatives from
the M u s i c College and the university authorities and
agreed that they would fry to use the building as
little as possible during the day while music students
were using the practice rooms. A committee is being
set up to examine h o w best to utilise the building.
The Welfare Vice President at Manchester University
U n i o n said today that the most important thing was
that the building was properly used and not just
allowed to rot.
Sir Brian Flowers
deplores low grants
. . . and student action to
defend living standards
The former C h a i r m a n of the Science Research
Council, S I R B R I A N F L O W E R S , F R S , i n his first
public address since becoming Rector of Imperial
College, today deplored the low level of student main-
tenance grants. Speaking to a n audience of Imperial
College's staff, students and their parents in the R o y a l
Albert H a l l , S i r B r i a n said that students' opportuni-
ties to benefit from university life were being limited
by the present depressed value of the grants they
received. Even if one accepted the basis o n which:
grants were calculated i n 1971 (and he had reason!
to believe that this was not entirely satisfactory) a!
triennial scale fixed as it h a d turned out, f o r thej
three years i n which inflationary pressures had been;
exceptionally severe, and lacking any suitable mech-;
anism for adjustments meanwhile, was not one which;
commended itself to anyone b u t the most arid o f
bureaucrats. Students believed that their grants were
now too low; but worse than that, they believed that
their genuine financial difficulties were unrecognized
but socially divisive, that the level o f grant under-
valued the contributions they already made to society,
Still more the contributions they were preparing them-
selves to make i n the future. S i r Brian said that he
shared these beliefs and that, so long as they were
being responsibly expressed, he would support them.
Considering the position of a n Imperial College
undergraduate resident i n a hall o f residence o r
student house, Sir Brian said that he had calculated
that the present level o f undergraduate maintenance
grant was deficient b y at least £100 a year. H e made
no comment, he said, about students in other circum-
stances nor about the average student, whoever he
may be.
Sir Brian said that he recognized that any proposed
increase i n student grants had to be sought i n com-1
petition with a l l other urgent calls o n public funds1
—for old-age pensions, new hospitals and schools. H e
also acknowledged that i t was not for the universities
to determine the social status o f students, b u t he
submitted that the proper financial welfare of o u r
young people in universities and colleges was a matter
most deserving o f the Government's urgent attention.
Leeds Poly Sit-in
Students at Leeds Polytechnic reconvened a U n i o n
meeting in the administrative block at (the Polytechnic
yesterday. A b o u t 600 students decided t o move into
the administrative block at 1 p.m. and several dozen
stayed over night. They intend to remain i n occupa-
tion of the block until Friday. They are protesting
at the inadequacy of teaching, catering a n d union
facilities.
T h e telephone to the Polytechnic has been cut off
by the P.O. at the request of the administration.
The Director of the Polytechnic, Patrick Nutgens,
is i n Scotland at the moment, but the Assistant D i r -
ector, Gordon Wright, has expressed some sympathy
with the students. H e has agreed that only "essential"
work will be carried out by the administration for
the next few days.
It is widely accepted amongst the adoiinistration,
staff and students that facilities which were adequate
for 1,000 students are no longer adequate since there
has been a considerable expansion i n student numbers*
Leeds Education Committee are prepared to offer
some alternative accommodation i n Headrow i n
Leeds. A l d e r m a n A r t h u r Tallant is expected t o speak
to the students in occupation today,
Margaret Thatcher, Minister of Education, went t o
Leeds o n Friday to open a factory i n the morning and
a school i n the afternoon. When she arrived to open
the school she was greeted b y a large number of,
students from all over Yorkshire.
The students marched from Leeds Polytechnic,
They protested about the plans for the future of edu-
cation as expressed i n last year's White Paper, " A
framework for expansion" and the inadequacies o f
the grant system.
Students without grants
Some Local Education Authorities have not yet
sent out grant cheques to students w h o live i n
their area. Several colleges have reported that a n u m -
ber of their students are Still waiting for their grant
cheques to come through.
Huddersfield Polytechnic, Hereford College of E d u -
cation a n d the University of W a r w i c k seem t o bs
particularly badly hit. Tony Bowers, President o f
Huddersfield Polytechnic Students U n i o n is hoping
that students in this predicament will b e able to claim
social security until their grant arrives. W a r w i c k U n i -
versity has had to tell some students that their grants
may not arrive for another six weeks.
One of the reasons for the delay i n the receipt o f
grants this year is that the L E A ' s have found i t
difficult to sort out the new grant regulations which
Margaret Thatcher announced to Parliament o n M a y
15th. T h e raising of the threshold level for parental
contributions from £1,100 to £1,500 has caused par-
ticular difficulty.
Resignation of Camhridge
Executive
The Cambridge Students' Union Executive has
been forced to resign. T h e executive, the majority of
whom are on the right, was elected last term. Ever
since they have said that ithey have been hamstrung
by the composition of general meetings, which by the
constitution of the union make a l l major policy
decisions. They claim that general meetings are not
representative of the majority of students in C a m -
bridge.
Last Tuesday this executive called a referendum
to attempt to change the constitution so that policy
was made by referenda and not by general meeting.
Students were asked i f they wanted ithe U n i o n to be
controlled by referenda or general meeting.
When the result of ithe referendum was known the
right found that they had been defeated by their o w n
tactics. 2,156 students voted i n favour of taking deci-
sion making power away from general meeting, but
3,046 students voted that the general meeting should
retain sovereign power. This is the highest poll that
has ever taken place among Cambridge students.
Neville Walton, who was elected as the Camhridge
Student U n i o n president n o w finds himself i n a diffi-
cult position. A s a sabbatical officer o n his resigna-
tion h e will no longer b e either a member o f the
university, because h e is n o t registered a t C a m *
bridge as a student this year, o r a member o f the
students' union. H e is reported to have since fled to
Germany.
