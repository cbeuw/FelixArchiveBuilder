ANTI - LOMBARD
S o in reponse to the
threatened right-wing attack
o n students' efforts to de-
fend their rapidly vanishing
grants, due on Thursday at
the U G M , IC C o m m u n i s t
Party has launched a c a m -
paign for a broad left front
to meet this.
W h a t policies will this
broad left grouping have?
None other than those of the
N U S broad l e f t — w h i c h is a
communist party inspired
group designed to attract all
the flotsam a n d jetsam of
liberals, " p r o g r e s s i v e " christ-
ians and other wet lefts.
Their policies in short will
tie those of the N U S execu-
tive in the Digby J a c ks era
— t h o s e w h i c h after a year
of rallies, demonstrations,
petitions, rent strikes, sit-ins
and refectory boycotts, in-
volving up to 5 0 0 , 0 0 0
students, ' w o n ' us a derisory
£ 2 0 w h i c h with the present
rate of inflation amounts to
a grant cut.
T h e numbers of students
involved in these reformist
{protest politics, designed to
'pressurize' the Government
iMto agreeing to the four basic
N U S demands, was in fact
quite despite the overt bank-
ruptcy of their reformist poli-
cies
O n one hand you have the
C o m m u n i s t Party and its re-
visionist sycophants, the IS
« n d the I M G , saying that we
can get higher grants if we
show the justness of our
cause, and a d d in s o m e mili-
tancy to show we really need
the d e m a n d s met, and on the
ether you have the Tory Gov-
ernment preparing the ground
to impose a fascist dictator-
ship.
A conflict is due in the
next p e r i o d — a conflict of re-
volutonary proportions,which
will be resolved in one of
two ways: fascism or social-
ism, the middle road of a
parliamentary democracy has
vanished out of the window
and is disappearing over the
horizon in direct correlation
to the decreasing circulation
• f the Guardian.
T h e Tories have legislated
sway nearly every right that
the working class has won
in over 150 years of struggle
— t h e right to strike, won
when the Taff Vale judge-
ment of 1901 was repealed,
has g o n e — i t is illegal to
strike for more than the
Phase III norm of 7 per cent.
T h e right to form independ-
ent T r a d e Unions, won when
the Combinations Act was
repealed in 1824, has gone
— U n i o n s have to register
under the Industrial Relations
Act, or else be liable for an
unlimited fine in the High
Courts, it goes without say-
ing that registration is c o m -
plete state control of the
Unions, such as we find in
Spain today.
T h e right to an unarmed
police force has g o n e — n o t
o n l y has the armed Special
Patrol Group been expanded
enormously (and if you think
they were formed to guard
embassies, then account for
them being based in H a m -
mersmith, Brixton and Ley-
t o n s t o n e — w o r k i n g class
areas, miles from the nearest
embassy) but the police have
-recently been equipped with
6 0 0 of the most powerful
rifles that the A r m y use.
There is a c o m m i s s i o n taking
place to bring the Police and
the A r m y under one central-
ized control and furthermore
d o w n in Winchester, the pol-
ice and certain units of the
A r m y are being trained to-
gether in counter-insurgency.
Soldiers of lodav are no lon-
ger t r a i n e d in C a e s a r ' s " D e
Bello G a l l i c o " but instead
are referred to Brigadier
Frank Kitson's " L o w Density
Operations".
W h y are the Tories prepar-
ing like this? W h y did Heath
say in his address to the
United Nations in 1 9 7 0 : " T h e
seventies will not be a time
of war between nations, but
rather of CIVIL w a r " ? W h y
d id Brigadier Calvert state
with such impunity, in an
Observer colour supplement
a few months ago, that it is
likely that there will be an
attempted insurrection before
the end of the decade? How
do the Tories K N O W ?
T h e answer to that is de-
monstrated every time you
go to the shops—inflation. In
order to boost up their flag-
ging balance of payments, in
order to inject value into
their worthless paper money,
they have floated d o w n the
pound. T h i s enables them to
export easily to countries
like Germany whose cur-
rency has floated u p — b u t
at the s a m e time imports
cost that m u c h more. Half
of our foodstuffs are import-
ed and every time the Tories
float d o w n further and make
huge profits from exporting
more (on paper only inciden-
t a l l y — y o u can't buy dear and
sell cheap and make a C O N -
C R E T E profit!) our food
prices shoot to new record
leva's.
T h e Tories have to d o
this, they have no choice, for
them to exist as a class they
have to export or die. But for
the working class it means
a rapidly diminishing stand-
ard of living and with every
law that passes onto the stat-
ute books of the Tories, the
signing away of the d e m o -
cratic rights of the working
c l a s s — u n t i l today when it is
illegal to fight to D E F E N D
your standard of living.
Inflation? W e haven't
seen anything yet. W h e n the
Financial T i m e s talks about
this being a period of Pre-
W e i m a r inflation it means
that prices will not just go
through the c e i l i n g — b u t
through the roof and into
interstellar overdrive? Re-
member the one mark Ger-
man stamps overstamped one
million m a r k s ? — T h a t was in-
flation during the perod of
the Weimar Republic of the
early 30s.
That the working class
will fight to defend its rights
and living standards neither
the Tories nor the Y S S S
have any doubt. Whether it
wins that struggle or not de-
pends on the leadership of
the working class. W h e n we
are talking about this c o n -
flict we are talking about the
question of power, of owner-
ship of the factories and fin-
ance houses, and the sole
way that the working class
can avoid the crushing de-
feat of fascism is to take the
p o w e r — t o nationalise all the
major industries and banks
under workers' control and
without compensation.
Placed against the back-
ground of the e c o n o m i c cris-
is and the present prepara-
tions of the ruling c l a s s —
does not campaigning with
petitions for higher grants
seem somewhat inadequate?
Except of course unless one
needs to learn through prac-
tice that petitions lead o n l y
to full waste paper baskets
in the D E S and rent strikes
to fines or being sent down,
period.
But is that not the lesson
of last year's grants c a m -
paign and the lesson of all
protest politics be they in
the T r a d e or Student Unions,
in this p e r i o d — t h a t reform-
ism leads to defeat, and that
a new, revolutionary, leader-
ship has to be built to fight
to take the working class to
power.
T h e n it follows that for
those in the broad left and
their adherents, to now
launch a campaign to win
students to policies and
methods of struggle which
have been proved I N P R A C -
T I C E to be incapable of win-
ning anythng except a fur-
ther cut in o u r grants,
constitutes a most enormous
betrayal o f t h e interests of
s t u d e n t s a n d t h e working
c l a s s .
T h i s is n o t t o s a y that it
is a b e t r a y a l t o fight for

Medical A i d for Vietnam
by Alastair H a y
The war in Indo China, although it currently re-
ceives little news coverage, is far from over. It is
reported that there are over 100 bombing missions a
day by the Saigon forces and that the number of
political prisoners has increased from 200,000 to
300,000 i n the past few months. These are only two
of the violations of the Paris Peace Agreements. The
importance of the Agreements is recognised i n the
following statement from M a d a m e Nguyen T h i Binh,
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Revolu-
tionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-
nam ( P R G ) in a letter to the Medical A i d Committee
for Vietnam, wrote:
" W e ardently wish that the solidarity and the
precious support of your people will continue, and
strengthen us in our struggle to ensure the strict
implementation by the U S A and the Saigon adminis-
tration of the Agreement signed, to acknowledge the
role of the P R G , the genuine representative of the
people of South Vietnam, to help heal the wounds
of war to build up the liberated zones and to support
the political struggle of the people of South Vietnam
for the right to self-determination."
Branson P. Clark, Executive Secretary of the
American Friends Service Committee (a Quaker or-
ganisation) having just returned from a week in N o r t h
Vietnam, bad this to say: " T h e Vietnamese are pre-
pared for the possibility of renewed U.S. bombing on
their country. B u t at the same time they are literally
building homes, schools and public buildings with
their bare hands in an atmosphere of optimistic re-
construction."
The whole story of destruction of Vietnam is not
yet known, but we have some details. Nearly six
million square metres of housing completely destroy-
ed; 58 secondary and technical schools completely
destroyed; 2,867 primary schools completely
destroyed; agriculture was systerntaitioally destroyed.
Bombing of the dams destroyed m a n y of the rice
fields; three-quarters of a l l chemical plants were
destroyed; 80 per cent of the textile and clothing
factories destroyed, three-quarters of the food i n -
dustry destroyed. Millions of square metres of ware-
houses, holding food and produce were reduced to
rubble.
With the destruction of over 650 hospitals, recon-
struction of hospitals is special priority.
The Medical A i d Committee for Vietnam
(M.A.C.U.) sends medical supplies to the Libera-
tion R e d Cross of South Vietnam and to the V i e t n a m
Red Cross for use in N o r t h Vietnam, Laos and C a m -
bodia. Dr. Nguyen V a n T i n , Vice-Minister of Health
of the D . R . V . N . and President of the V i e t n a m R e d
Cross i n a letter to M . A . C . U . acknowledges their
importance: " Y o u r aid and your expressions of sup-
port during the war, as in the initial phase of the
restoration of peace i n Vietnam, touch us deeply and
give us great encouragement i n our struggle to safe-
guard our independence. In spite of the blockade
and the intensive bombardment by the U.S. A i r
Force, your consignments of medical instruments
have arrived at their destination . . . "
A l l the evidence available indicates that the level
of destruction in C a m b o d i a is equally as that docu-
mented for Vietnam. It will be many years betore the
People of Indo C h i n a are able to rebuild Ithdr coun-
tries, and maintain a lasting peace. M . A C " ' have
been assisting the Vietnamese for eight years and
hope to play a positive role i n the reconstruction
of N o r t h V i e t n a m and ithe liberated areas of South
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Together with other
European committees M . A . C . U . supplies urgent drugs
for the treatment and prevention of malaria, tuber-
losis, cholera, polio, measles, plague, and vitamin
deficiency diseases. Surgical equipment, 500 dental
packs and 200 mobile hospital units are the latest
items which have been requested. The surgical equip-
ment and dental packs have already been sent, and
125 hospital units will be sent shortly. E a c h hospital
unit costing £1,000 each and containing over 1,000
instruments will enable a team of six medical per-
sonnel to treat people at village and commune level.
Together with ithe medical supplies M . A . C . U . is
restocking hospital and medical libraries with the rele-
vant journals a n d textbooks. 20 tons of literature,
worth approx. £30,000 has been sent this year. Medi-
cal slides for the teaching of the basic medical sciences
are also i n preparation-^four types i n Anatomy,
morbid anatomy, Physiology and Midwifery have al-
ready been sent.
The Medical A i d Committee relies for its w o r k on
financial contributions, for individuals and groups,
street collections and ' R a g ' sponsoring. W i t h 'Viet-
nam' rapidly becoming an issue of the past it is
crucial to inform people that the danger is not over.
M . A . C . U . workers would be delighted to speak at
meetings and discuss their activities with any indi-
viduals interested i n the reconstruction of Indo China.

c o n t d . f r o m p a g e 7
Wednesday saw another
example of the chaos
which we seem to spread
wherever we go. This time
it was a league race on
our own course at Peters-
ham. There were about
140 taking part and the
course was so cunningly
marked that the first ten
of .these went somewhat
wrong; i n fact a certain
Borough R o a d person,
who was at one stage
first, finished 37th because
of this. Some people
weren't very pleased.
Once again we were out
in force with four teams i n
all, finishing 6th of 12 i n
the 1st division, and 7th,
14th and 19th of 24 in
division 2. Besides those
who appeared on Satur-
day there were R. Har-
rington, W. Collins, M i k e
Welford, Ashley Cooper
and R o b Maddison, There
was some evidence of a
recurrence of our tradi-
tional packing-at-the-back
with eight in the last 30.
First back was Paul Clarke
at 29 th in 31m 03 follow-
ed by R o b Allison (34th)
in 31m 18. Dave Payne
(who demanded a men-
tion) was 69th in 33m 15,
and is doubtless building
up for an attack on his
personal best of 29m 30.
Ian Ellis and Phil Meyler
starred i n their first
league race at 59th equal
(almost) in 32m 39. A l s o
making a successful . first
appearance was the H o n -
orary Football with its at-
tendant Officer.
Pad said I should find
something good to say
about h i m this time: well

bitterly hostile to us. B u t we do be-
lieve that we can give many left-wing-
ers hope — a realistic way forward for
building a strong IC Union with left
policies, and support from the students
to make them work.
In the immediate future we hope to
fight for our views in the Union, help
formulate policies for the Broad Left
both here and nationally and sell and
contribute to the Broad Left Journal
(on sale soon). In the long term we hope
to transform the union, with an active,
fighting, left leadership and more im-
portant an active, fighting, thinking,
rank and file!
