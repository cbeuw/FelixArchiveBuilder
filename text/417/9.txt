The Lyttelton Theatre
IF T H E R E were one event that could
prevent me from beginning my review with
a paean for R a l p h R i c h a r d s o n , Wendy -Hi I ler
and Peggy Ashcroft in Ibsen's John
Gabrield Borkmann, it could only be the
opening of the new National Theatre
buildings on the South Bank, east of
Waterloo bridge.
It is now 128 years since the wrangling
over the setting up of a theatre for the
nation began. Among the sites which have,
over the years, been earmarked for a
National company i s that plot opposite the
V i c t o r i a and Albert Museum now occupied
by a well-known car hire company.
The new building is magnificent -
almost overwhelmingly s o , s i n c e it nearly
takes over a s the focus of attention from
the prime target of the play and its per-
formance. I hope that this is only a
transient effect, for, although this is one
of the very few new theatre buildings to
open in Europe in recent years and presents
a radical new concept in theatre going to
the public, the actors should really be the
central attraction.
The National Theatre h a s always
provided c o n c e s s i o n s to students in the
form of cheaper seats for those w i l l i n g to
queue early on the day of the performance,
but its new policy of seat booking in the
Lyttelton requires that you arrive early at
the theatre to stake your c l a i m to a
particular numbered seat. Apart from the
10X3 £1 seats (half to be sold in advance
Terraced in!
and half on the day of the performance from
8.30 am) a l l seats cost £2.35, which pays
for admission to the auditorium. A premium
of £2 will secure the seat of your c h o i c e ,
the remaining seats are distributed to
those with £2.35 tickets, not more than
two hours before curtain-up. However there
is plenty to do and s e e if you arrive
early.
There are two buffets, a restaurant and
several bars, which are a l l open in the
daytime a s appropriate. The cramped
bookstall of the O l d V i c days h a s become
more spacious and there are, at present,
two exhibitions of theatrical objects. On
most evenings there are events beginning
around 6.15. T h e s e take the form of readings
or concerts in the spacious foyers or in a
special room set aside for the purpose.
When the National Theatre project w a s
being tossed around by committees there
was a general consensus that one audit-
orium would not be enough. Y o u cannot
have an auditorium versatile enough to
hold Shakespeare — ideally on a thrust
stage — and more modern plays written,for
the proscenium arch. So this building holds
three stages.Only the Lyttelton (proscenium)
is open so far - one of Peter H a l l ' s great
s u c c e s s e s in that, in h i s own words, " H e
got h i s foot in the d o o r " - the O l i v i e r
(thrust) is hopefully to open early in J u l y ,
with the Cottesloe (a small studio) coming
later. T h e Grand Official Opening by the
Queen comes later s t i l l ; but for the time
being the building is at last living.
The architect, Denys L a s d u n , has
done the nation proud, using shuttered
concrete to enforce a strong vertical line
inside the foyers, with numerous levels
and balconies, from which to observing
the arriving audiences and the special
events. Perhaps he h a s failed in respect
that the Thames is almost invisible from
within the building for, although the
windows are there in profusion, multi-
level terracing, which w i l l clearly be well
occupied on warm summer evenings,
obscures any v i e w s across to Somerset
H o u s e .
The Lyttelton seems to justify the new
ticket scheme s i n c e a l l the seats appear
to have an equal advantage. There i s no
feeling, at the back of the s t a l l s , of being
tucked in under the c i r c l e , and there are
a few long rows instead of the usual
tunnel in which the stage seems a million
miles from the back rows. In fact the
Lyttelton seats twelve more than the O l d
V i c , in a great deal more intimacy.
John Gabriel Borkmann is one of s i x
plays transferred to Lyttelton for an
introductory season. I didn't s e e it at the
Old V i c but the larger Lyttelton stage
seems to make more of the claustrophobic
interiors with large dark voids on either
side. Sir Ralph and Daine Wendy, with
their idiosyncratic fidgeting in particular
filled the theatre with their d i s t r e s s . A
splendid performance in a splendid new
theatre.

Music
David Bowie - Station to Station ( R C A )
Excellent
T H A T M A N B o w i e does it again. Not
content with e x e r c i s i n g h i s super-
star talents in the film genre, he has
augmented h i s already excellent catalogue
of albums with yet another vinyl
masterpiece.
He departs from h i s usual
musical trend and produces music that is
not e a s i l y catagorised. However, this
does not in anyway detract from it. On
the contrary, catagorising is made
difficult by the individuality expressed
in the music.
The album features the hit single
"Golden Years" - a far superior version
of which is on the album. In fact, there
isn't a single dud track on the whole
album but one must single out "Word on
Wing" and "Stay" a s absolute Bowie
c l a s s i c s of the future.
The former combines the remarkable
v o i c e of B o w i e , the neat and tight
drumming of Dennis Davis and the piano
playing of R o y Bittan to excellent effect.
The latter is surely one of the best
pieces of contemporary funky-rock music
I have heard for some time.
I have a l w a y s been somewhat reserved
a s regards B o w i e ' s music, but without
hesitation, I can heartily recommend
this album to y o u .

T h i s album is a complete enigma as
far a s I am concerned. It is neither of
anything and when the first line of the
lyrics to the first track on s i d e one is
"Deep down in my soul I hate rock and
roll" then a feeling of utter contempt
begins to creep in for the whole album.
A s my dear friend Lorna pointed out,
"It doesn't have "Without You" on i t "
and I would agree with her in so far a s
there is no tune on this vinyl which is
of the calibre of that song.
The only remotely decent song on the
whole album is "Pretty soon there'll be
nothing left for everybody". The way
things are going at the moment I'd agree.
I must, however, not finish without
mentioning "The Flying Saucer Song". A
really amusing song about two drunks
having a conversation in a bar — the
sort of conversation that every drunk
dreams of having. It is beautifully put to
music with a great deal of effect. I can
imagine people buying the album just for
this song. A word of warning, however;
beware of ending up a s crab dinner the
same way N i l s o n seems to have done!

Cinema
The Slipper A n d T h e Rose by Bryan'
Forbes: starring Richard Chamberlain,
Gemma Craven, Anette Crosbie etc.
T H E R E A R E only two things wrong with
this film in my view and these are that
it is produced by David Frost and the
songs are written by the Sherman brothers.
However, once I'd got over these two
unsavoury facts, the film became, for me
a thoroughly entertaining one.
It overflows with the British stars,
some of whom go in for this type of film
and some who don't. Richard Chamberlain
manages to hide h i s discomfort and
struggle through, but the honours must go
to Annette C r o s b i e a s the F a i r y Godmother.
She plays the typically charming but
resigned mother always coming to the
rescue with a s i g h . T h i s together with
her insistence to look ordinary is in
marked contrast to o n e ' s idea of a
Fairy godmother.
Kenneth Moore as the Chamberlain
and Julian Orchard a s Montague, the
P r i n c e ' s c o u s i n , are definitely the
biggest pair of jokers in the film except
possibly for the Dowager Queen (Edith
Evans) whose interjections are a
humorous treat.
The film is overplayed in parts a s in
the scene in the K i n g ' s Court but
otherwise moves at a fairly brisk pace
with romance and d i s a s t e r coming through
tit for tat.
