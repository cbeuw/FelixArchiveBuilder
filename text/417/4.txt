Closed sessions and
the student press
FOLLOWING T H E decision, taken in the first session of
conference, that Finance Committee Report on NUS Services
(Travel, Marketing and Endsleigh) should not be held in
closed session, a constitutional amendment allowing
Student Press into closed sessions was carried over-
whelmingly. The opposition to this move was, not unjustifiably
due to inaccurate reports of the NUS Travel financial
situation (in the main) which many Executive members and
others considered irresponsible. No doubt, since first hand
information will be available in the future, the accuracy of
such articles will improve.
Some felt that the Student Press were a dispensible
luxury; delegates should report back to their SRC's /UGM's,
and all the Student Press can do is cut the ground from
under their feet. But, on the whole, it was realised that the
Student Press has a valuable role to play in relaying,
accurately, information that the Nationals would rather
ignore or distort. Since our readership is higher than the
attendances at UGM's, etc, we are obviously in a good
position to bridge that "communication gap".
It must be remembered, however, that the representatives
of the Student Press at conference are not elected; they are
not delegates fallowing mandates. Nor must they, in any
way whatsoever, be allowed to interfere in the running of
conference. They are, in the strictest sense, observers, but
as such must be allowed to observe the proceedings in their
entirity.
But the new ruling does mean that the current arrangements
for Student Press representatives are totally unacceptable;
the security element at present is zero, and, although
Press badges were issued, no credentials were ever checked
Obviously an unsatisfactory state of affairs if we are to
be allowed to view the deepest and darkest secrets of the
Union.
The Tory challenge
T H E A N T I C I P A T E D , and much publicised, Tory challenge
of the Federation of Conservative Students (FCS) seemed to
fizzle out immediately after the Presidential Election, when
their candidate was beaten into third place.They, effectively,
held the balance of power between the Broad Left (Labour
Party and Communist Party alliance) and the more extreme
left wing (the IMG, IS, etc.) with a transfer of about 85 votes
going consisiantl) to the Broad Left candidates. Their
strength has risen, however, since the Scarborough
Conference when they had just over a dozen delegates.
This has been reflected by the fact that they now have
one executive member, Steve Moon, and means that their
policies will have a platform at National level. Just how
seriously the Broad Left are taking the F C S will be seen
when Mr Moon receives his specific responsiblities.
Their success/failure at the next conference will
depend to a great extent on the policies expounded by Mr
Moon, it will also require the F C S to put forward some
committed and experienced leaders. It is quite obvious that
the Broad Left had been opposed to a Tory on the executive,
they could, by putting forward stronger candidates for the
lower positions, have prevented it. Of course, if they had
no stronger candidates to provide the back-up, they couldn't
prevent the F C S getting at least one seat if they had
wanted to. The fact that David Willis was narrowly (by 7
votes) defeated by the Broad Left candidate would indicate
the latter being the case.
