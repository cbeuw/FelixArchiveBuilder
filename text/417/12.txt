F O U N D E D IN 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
No. 417 Friday April last, 1976. F R E E !
IT'S A SELL OUT!
FELIX Dinner sell out scandal
A S U R P R I S E A N N O U N C E M E N T from Mr. Paul
Ekpenyong, Editor of F E L I X , at the Editorial Board
Meeting last Monday, revealed that the F E L I X
Annual Dinner, planned for the 17th May, has been
sold out even before the printing of the tickets.
FREE REAL ALE
"This success is not surprising,"he commented,
"when you consider that the price is iust £4.50 for a
single ticket and £8.00 for a double.And there is free
real ale, a barrelfull, for afterwards."
FREE SALT
Members of the Board are taking the announcement
with a pinch of salt - as they recommend all readers to -
since no returns from ticket s a l e s have yet appeared in
the accounts. Neither has Mr. Ekpenyong's standard of
living risen so drastically as one would expect of a
person who has just come into money. Although he was
seen buying himself a drink in the Union Bar just last
weekend.
FREE GEORGE DAVIS
" W e confidently expect that tickets will be available
from this Monday," said Mr. Duncan S u s s , B u s i n e s s
Manager of F E L I X . "This statement from Mr. Ekpenyong
is totally without foundation. None of the Board have
even seen these tickets yet, let alone sold any, and we
are sure that he hasn't. We feel that he said it merely
to create the possibility of a spoof article like this in
order to advertise the Dinner. Which, by the way, is very
good value Indeed and promises to be a great do."
RAQUEL WELCH
Any p e r s o n who does bring her w i l l receive the
grateful thanks of all the F E L I X staff, and a vote w i l l
be taken as to whether or not that person should be
admitted free of charge.(She certainly woulcbe.)
T H E P O S T E R S which caused a lot of problems (right)
were removed this week, and w i l l be replaced by our
" n e w i m p r o v e d " version.
Watch out for it, f o l k s !
Right; Mr P a u l Ekpenyong
A word of explanation.
T O T H O S E of you who have already noticed something different
about this week's front page,this note of explanation i s offered.
(And to those who haven't - read on!)
F i r s t of a l l , we needed to advertise the F E L I X A N N U A L
D I N N E R (get your tickets here, folks). Anyone who still doesn't
want to come was either crippled in the rush to grab F E L I X off
the newstands or belongs to a c l a s s of people bestunmentioned.
The second reason could be described as temporal.(It could
a l s o be d e s c r i b e d as sheer bloody c u s s e d n e s s - E d . ) It tell
about this year that we were deprived at our one legitimate
opportunity to pull a real fast one over our readership.
A P R I L the F I R S T L A N D E D S L A P in the M I D D L E of H O L I D A Y S
So this issue, being dated the 30th of A p r i l , or A p r i l the L a s t ,
has taken over the role that the non-existent April F o o l edition
would have had.
