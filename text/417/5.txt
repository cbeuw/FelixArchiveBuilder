Clarke and Slipman in, Lanning out
Broad Left landslide
Tory on Executive - first for 10 years
THE NEW EXECUTIVE of the
NUS has 12 out of 15 members of
the Broad Left; two are Inter-
national Socialists, and, for the
first time in ten years, a Tory has
been elected.
F C S T R A N S F E R
The voting pattern at Llandudno was
quite clear: the Broad Left could
command 300 votes, the Federation of
Conservative Students about 9 0 , and
the remainder went to the ultra-left
groups. The F C S transferred consistently
to the Broad L e f t , giving them the
necessary majority in a l l the top eight
positions o n the E x e c u t i v e .
Charles C l a r k e , last year's President,
beat Hugh Lanning (retiring National
Treasurer) by the 80 or so votes
transferred from Mark Hapgood, the
F C S candidate (who came third), and
in the same w a y , Sue Slipman w a s
re-elected to her post of National
Secretary. Perhaps the greatest shock,
Hugh Lanning
though, w a s when Hugh L a n n i n g
(Independant Socialist) w a s beaten by
Chris Morgan i n the election for National
Treasurer; Hugh commands quite a
large personal vote, and it h a s been
four years s i n c e a n incumbent officer
h a s . been defeated i n an e l e c t i o n .
Pete A s h b y w a s e l e c t e d Deputy P r e s i d e n t
the way made clear by A l i s t a i r Stewart's
retirement from student p o l i t i c s .

only s u c c e s s f u l F C S candidate, i s
going to have a hard j o b o n the
E x e c u t i v e ; he i s notonly the " s p o k e s m a n "
for the T o r i e s , but i s , i n the eyes o f
many, the custodian of the Conservative
P r i n c i p l e . H o w well the F C S do i n the
next e l e c t i o n w i l l depend to a large
extent o n t t i s performance.

C O N F E R E N C E CONCISELY...
STUDENT PRESS are to be allowed into closed
sessions at future conferences.
THE GRANTS CLAIM is now £1140 for all
students (£1250 in London), with no means test or
discriminatory awards.
NUS T R A V E L is on the road to recovery, with
a breakeven expected this year.
EDUCATION requires a new approach and deep
analysis.
OVERSEAS STUDENTS are not to be left on their
own, but we can't do it all for them.
A CONSTITUTION WORKING PARTY has been
ruled out by Conference.
E E C AFFAIRS need more publicity in the CO's,
as does the whole of International work.
SABBATICAL SALARIES are to be linked to the
current grants claim.
FASCISM and RACISM have been denounced and
its total opposition has been reaffirmed.
Graduates face dole queue
ONE IN E V E R Y seven students leaving
college this summer will "have no chance
of getting jobs before Christmas, and a
substantial part of those will stay on the
dole queues for far longer", claimed
Charles Clarke, NUS President, in his
opening address to the conference.
School students were, however, in an
even worse position.
" I n the cuts which w e are told are
so necessary, the projected number of
students i n higher education h a s been
cutback to 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 " , he s a i d .
At the same time, the number o f
school leavers was steadily increasing
and this trend would continue into the
1980's, said Mr C l a r k e .
The Government p o l i c i e s which gave
rise to this situation a n d which repre-
sented a concerted economic strategy
were not being accepted lying down.
The fight to change these p o l i c i e s , and
this economic strategy, w a s one to
which the whole of the student movement
must be committed, Mr C l a r k e s a i d ,
" T h e question at stake i s whether w e
can change the course o f s o c i e t y ? "
In order to do this, said Mr C l a r k e ,
the N U S " m u s t put forward an alternative
economic solution a n d w i n to i t s side
the student body. If w e do not succeed
in that we condemn ourselves to
p o l i t i c a l i m p o t e n c e . "
Continuing h i s attack on the Govern-
ment, Mr C l a r k e a c c u s e d them of
spreading, through conventional p o l i t i c a l
life, c y n i c i s m among the membership of
the national union. C y n i c i s m had become
the p o l i t i c a l watchword, as the Labour
Government h a d become the government
of the Establishment, he said.
It w a s the duty of the N U S to break
down this c y n i c i s m and to overcome the
rejection of p o l i t i c a l life that existed
among many members of the Union. " A l l
students must recognise that the d e c i s i o n s
of government matter to u s a l l " , Mr
Clarke said.
