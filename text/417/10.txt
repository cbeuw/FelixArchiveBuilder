five hours — amazing. A s w e cross the

with snow. A t Waverley station the

balmy 14C

more snow f a l l s , the slush i s slow to
clear from the pavements.

Charles Manowitz's Palach opens the
proceedings. We a l l s i t within a c i r c l e ,

that whatever personal s a c r i f i c e s a man
may make to express a want for freedom,

bombast from the media that h i s single

self-immolation i n Wenceleslas Square,
Prague, in 1968? T o some extent it i s the
conditioning that w e receive from news-
papers a n d t e l e v i s i o n to the news that
they present that dulls the sharp edges
of our memory.

A ten minute walk down the Royal

Theatre, where the Central School of
Art and D e s i g n have got together what I
can only describe a s a piece of performed
design. T w e l v e students have each

d i s t i l l e d h i s or her impressions of it into
a five minute performance. What are our
reactions supposed to be? Should we
end up by having some idea of what
distinguishes one town from another.

S U N D A Y - A talk from JW Lambert,
Literary a n d Arts editor of the Sunday
T i m e s , by whose grace the festival h a s
been brought to- the age of majority, and
continues to survive. H e gives us a
good look at the role o f the c r i t i c in the
theatre and the method b y w h i c h he w o r k s .

A n acrimonious d i s c u s s i o n ensues
between those who are enchanted and
those who are amazed that such work has
been selected for the F e s t i v a l . T h e
selectors patiently explain for the
umpteenth time that, of course they are
fallible, but you should have seen the
amount of rubbish they had to s i t
through.
We a l l s p i l l into the R o y a l L y c e u m
for a professional performance — Yobbo
Nowt by John McGrath — by the 7.84
Theatre Company (England). Their name
comes from the reported fact that 7% of
the population own 84% of the wealth.
T h e i r work i s designed for the 93.16
majority; they set out to use the theatre
to educate the working man p o l i t i c a l l y
with a great deal of fun thrown i n . It i s
difficult to judge how it would go down
with i t s intended audience but the
students certainly enjoy the vitality
which h a s been m i s s i n g from the
F e s t i v a l so far.
M O N D A Y - T h e Strathclyde Theatre
Group h a s come across from Glasgow
with four productions; three of which
we s e e this afternoon. Of particular
interest i s [slot I, a monologue for a
disembodied mouth by Samuel Beckett.
It i s a curiously compelling performance
of a rarely seen work, though much is in
the writing.
Coup d'Etat, from K e e l e , i s another
student written production. A n urban
guerilla comes to dinner i n order to
commit suicide under the noses of h i s
media-orientated h o s t s . Gordon Honey-
combe complains that the revoluntionary's
black polo-neck uniform i s exactly what
he himself i s wearing. There i s a
fascinating study of the cultivated city
gent putting forward h i s right wing v i e w s
and getting slowly drunk. Minor details
in the production worry me; why are
they drinking vintage claret with
bouillabaisse a n d without decanting i t ?
E s p e c i a l l y a s the city gent i s teased
for his knowledge of fine food and wine!
The Scots have a curious custom of

T U E S D A Y - A fascinating day's work
with Mike L e i g h , a director who uses
improvisation to create drama. H i s talk
in- the morning serves only to whet the
appetite for the afternoon's practical
s e s s i o n . What we can learn in a n
afternoon i s severely limited (he
generally takes eight weeks to produce
a play) but, in small groups, we create
characters based on people we already
know and put them into situations where
we hope themes w i l l develop and a
story w i l l build up.
