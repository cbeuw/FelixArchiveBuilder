NUS Travel-the hardest road back
NUS T R A V E L will break even this
year, and is in a good position to recoup
. its £'4 million deficit over the next four
years. This was the message from Mr.
Mike Naylor, Managing Director of N U S
Travel Services L t d , at this year's
Llandudno Conference.
In a briefing, he explained that the
figure of £250,000 w a s grossly inflated
by the w a y i n which the accounting
procedure had been altered —the J a n u a r y /
December f i n a n c i a l year was changed to
M a y / M a y — to make reports to Conference
more accurate and up to date. T h i s
itself was l o s s making, due to ineffiencies,
m i s t a k e s , and the fact that a large outlay
was required to move headquarters
from L o n d o n to Cheltenham Spa.
S A T A flight r e c o r d s
out by £ 9 0 , 0 0 0
B u t the worst l o s s , he pointed out,
was the discrepancy amounting to some
£90,000 between their record of flight
bookings and those held by S A T A , the
international student flight administrators.
Since this w a s brought to light, fort-
nightly c h e c k s have been made, and a l l
the staff handling the T E L E X booking
equipment have been retrained and
tested. T h i s h a s brought the previous
error rate of 3% (costing about £12,000
last year) .down to l e s s than 0.6% for
January and February of this year,
N U S T S streamlined
In fact, the whole company has been
cut back a n d trimmed until only the
e s s e n t i a l s remain 40 of the previous
60 flights and train routes have been
dropped, leaving just the most popular
l i n e s s t i l l running, a n d as a result, a
p o s s i b l e further £80,000 l o s s h a s been
into a breakdown situation for this
year. Unfortunately, the cutbacks meant
that 8 people were no longer employable;
the redundancies caused an angry flare-
up at Conference, but, on the whole, it
was r e a l i s e d that the c h o i c e w a s of
some redundancies or more redundancies
and p o s s i b l e bankruptcy.'
F a i r p l a y
N U S T S has an ever increasing share
of the student market, and Mr. Nayldr,
i s confident that, given fair p l a y , this
summer w i l l realise a profit of over
£280,000 - w h i c h , allowing £200,000 to
cover the winter " s l u m p " , w i l l make up
the on-going deficit of i>A million
within four years if continued.
On the subject of fair p l a y , he
pointed out that some foreign students'
travel s e r v i c e s are operating (quite
unethically, i n h i s opinion) within the
U K , s e l l i n g (and getting commission on)
some of N U S T S ' s own flights. H e asked
a l l students to notice that these
practices were going on and c a l l e d o n
a l l students to boycott these companies.
Other competitors ( s p e c i f i c a l l y ,
Transalpine), h e s a i d , were "no longer
so much cheaper than ourselves". In a
recent c h e c k , of the E a s t e r brochure,
NUSTS were cheaper on some routes by
up to 20%.' T h i s i s due to the
international cooperation of some
European Students' T r a v e l Services i n
bulk-buying train space, and could
bring prices even lower if demand was
sufficient.
" S e t O f f " agreement
Mr. Naylor a l s o explained the " S e t O f f "
agreement with the bank; it does not
mean that the bank can confiscate funds
of the National U n i o n . What it does
mean i s that, in the event of any of the
N U S Services going bankrupt, and at the
same time having a n overdraft at the
bank, the bank has the right to take the
amount of that overdraft from any of the
other accounts in credit: this would then
be reclaimed from the receiver put i n
charge of the c a s e . In return, for the
purposes of c a l c u l a t i n g overdraft
interest charges, the accounts are
simply treated a s o n e , and s o the
amount p a i d i s considerably l e s s , a s
most of the accounts are i n credit for
the period when N U S T S i s i n overdraft.
N U S Marketing-
beer's the latest
thing
N U S Marketing, set up in January, i s
branching out into the f i e l d of beer: i t
has arranged with the Yorkshire brewery
T h e a k s t o n , to supply their beers to
U n i o n B a r s throughout the country. We
were given a chance to sample the
wares at the N U S Services D i s c o ,
where the O l d P e c u l i e r (Theakston's
Strong A l e ) flowed freely: it i s indeed a
brew worth sampling, and I look forward
to the p o s s i b i l i t y of having it i n our
U n i o n .
T h e y a l s o have wine, T - s h i r t s ,
c a l c u l a t o r s , and a whole store of other
lines — a l l of which are s e l l i n g w e l l
and proving the need for the companies
e x i s t e n c e .
Endsleigh-6-month
policy hit with
student
E n d s l e i g h Insurance's new 6-month
p o l i c y , underwritten by the Federation
Mutual Insurance L i m i t e d , may not be
the cheapest o n the market, but the
company feels that the ease with which
the system operates w i l l i n time bring
the overheads, and hence the premiums,
down to a much lower l e v e l . They s a y
that the reduced paperwork involved,
the simplicity of the pricing system,
and the competitiveness of the scheme
are attracting 600 students a week.
L a s t y e a r ' s l o s s (the first recorded for
many years) does not appear to be
repeating this year: the figures so far
indicate that there w i l l be a trading
profit of some £70,000.
Solidarity with overseas students
A R E S O L U T I O N condeming the attacks
on overseas students a s rascist a n d
" c a l c u l a t e d to divide a n d weaken the
whole student body in i t s opposition to
the educational c u t b a c k s " w a s over-
whelmingly carried with only two votes
against. T h e s e attacks, the resolution
s a i d , were " o n l y a percursor to attacks
on the entire student b o d y . "
The resolution a l s o rejected the
" m y t h s and l i e s spread about overseas
s t u d e n t s " , i n the p r e s s . It noted the
defeat of the I L E A proposal to c u t back
the number of overseas students i n I L E A
c o l l e g e s by 60% and the agreement
signed by L S O (London Student
Organisation) and the Inner L o n d o n
D i v i s i o n of N A T H E (National A s s o c i a t i o n
of T e a c h e r s i n Higher Education)
opposing these and any such proposals.
The resolution i t s e l f w a s moved by
Mr A Tuker, a Turkish student at the
C i t y U n i v e r s i t y . B y the implementation
of imperialist p o l i c i e s overseas,
students had been deprived of the right
to education i n their o w n countries, he
s a i d . "Without the support of B r i t i s h
s t u d e n t s , overseas students cannot
campaign effectively against the fees
increase and victimisation they f a c e d . "
Overseas students were not the vanguard
of the anti-discrimination fight — the
fight had to be a " s h o u l d e r to s h o u l d e r "
one with B r i t i s h students, he concluded.
A Trot amendment attacking the N U S
executive for not showing any initiative
on the issue of overseas students and
describing N U S publicity o n the plight
of overseas students a s " o f f e n s i v e and
p a s s i v e " w a s d e c i s i v e l y defeated.
The amendment that brought the
conference to the b o i l , however, w a s
that table b y T A C T , the C o l l e g e of
Commerce and Technology in H u l l . T h e
T A C T speakers were consistently
h e c k l e d and h a d considerable difficulty
in putting a c r o s s their case for B r i t i s h
first.

Mr N i c h o l a s F a i r b a i r n , moving the
amendment, said that the high standard
of education i n this country w a s a
marketable commodity w h i c h had been
