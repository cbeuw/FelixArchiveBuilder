Sabbatical salaries slashed
F U L L T I M E O F F I C E R S ( F T O ' s ) of the
N U S executive are to have their s a l a r i e s
linked to the grant c l a i m . T h e y w i l l now
receive a net salary of 52/30ths of what
the U n i o n c o n s i d e r s i s a fair grant.
Officers who previously received £3,200
plus £100 for each re-election w i l l now
be on about £2,600.
T h i s situation r a i s e s the p o s s i b i l i t y
of future conferences voting for small or
zero i n c r e a s e i n the main rate grant
c l a i m i f it i s decided that F T O ' s should
not receive a b i g pay i n c r e a s e . However
this i s rather u n l i k e l y ; .thus i n this
" i n d e x - l i n k e d " type situation, the F T O ' s
seem to be g u a r a n t e e d annual salary
increases in future. P r e v i o u s l y , F T O ' s
had to negotiate for pay increases and
this year had agreed not to receive an
increase, i n view of the U n i o n ' s finan-
c i a l situation.
The constitution debate w a s , however,
more concerned with the direct e l e c t i o n
of the executive by national secret ballot.
But once a g a i n , direct e l e c t i o n s were
d e c i s i v e l y rejected by the conference.
T h e resolution, which w a s eventually
carried by a two-thirds majority .condemns
direct e l e c t i o n of the executive a s
undesirable, e x p e n s i v e , impractical,
and liable to lead to bureaucracy and
careerism.
T w o major amendments were put to
the main m o t i o n ,one backed b y the
C o n s e r v a t i v e s and the other b y the
ultra left.
Mr. Steve Moon, executive member, in
moving the C o n s e r v a t i v e b a c k e d
amendment, c a l l e d for a " c o l l , l o n g look

Solidarity with overseas students
abused i n certain c a s e s . " O v e r s e a s
students are here by invitation and
should accept the d e c i s i o n s o f a
democratically elected government,"
Mr F a i r b a i r n s a i d . " I t w a s up to each
government to ensure the post school
education of i t s own nationals, he added.
R e p l y i n g to t h i s , a delegate from
Portsmouth P o l y t e c h n i c s a i d the N U S
had a commitment to the aim that education
is a right. "Who invited the bloody B r i t i s h
imperialists into h a l f the word a n y w a y ? * ,
he a s k e d .
At this point the debate became a
heated and severe condemnation of
fascism with • M s V a l e r i e Coultas
leading the attack. She a c c u s e d the
Broad Left of backing down on the
question of opposing f a s c i s m by any
means in the face of the campaigned
waged by the bourgeoise p r e s s .
The amendment w a s even more
d e c i s i v e l y defeated than the first o n e .
The remaining amendments were a l s o
defeated. Mr Trevor P h i l l i p s summing up
on the main motion said he d i d not
want to s e e overseas students sold
down the drain. " T h e Government i s
using overseas students a s scapegoats.
T h e only w a y to fight this i s to preserve
unity with overseas students. If we

the whole fight against c u t s " , he warned.

Mr. Peter Teague, I C U P r e s i d e n t ,
supporting the amendment,said t h a t a
look at the representative nature of N U S
was required. 'I hope we won't see Mr.
Stewart speaking on this motion and make
unrepresentative statements about the
undemocratic E l e c t o r a l Reform S o c i e t y , "
he added. H e w a s later to be d i s a p -
pointed i n h i s w i s h .
C h r i s Morgan, National Treasurer,
opposing the amendment, said that it
proposed d i s u n i t y at a time when a
fighting N U S w a s needed to c o m b a t
educational cutbacks and an iniquitous
grants system. The amendment was heavily
defeated b y 332810 votes to 110 516
with 50 874 abstentions - a majority of

The second amendment, backed by
the ultra left, supported the main resolu-
tion in rejecting direct e l e c t i o n s . Instead
it c a l l e d for the e l e c t i o n by S T V of the
bottom eleven members of the N U S e x e c .
The amendment w a s thrown out b y a
majority of 2 to 1.
A n amendment mandating the N U S
executive to a l l o w the c o l l e g e s of Oxford
and Cambridge to use the Conference
Subsidy F u n d w a s defeated by a subs
tantial majority. During the debate, the
Merton C o l l e g e delegate ( moving the
amendment ) described the executive a s
f a s c i s t s .
It w a s resolved to hold composite
meetings prior to the two N U S confer-
ences to enabie individual colleges to
get mandation on the final drafts of motions
that appear before these conferences.
T h e N U S holds two conferences a year,
one in the autumn and one at E a s t e r .
The conference a l s o decided that,
in future, the student press would be
a d m i t t e d into the c l o s e d s e s s i o n s of
conference. T h e amendment which prop-
osed this move instructs the N U S e x e c
" t o fully inform the student press of
major moves within the campaigning and
service a c t i v i t i e s of the U n i o n . "
The N U S i s to hold a one- day con-
ference on the question of its structure
and communications. In addition, a
survey i s being mounted to look into the
way colleges elect their delegates.
It w i l l now be p o s s i b l e for students to
find out who are the candidates standing
for N U S executive p o s t s . T h i s follows
a recommendation in the main motion
that candidates manifestos should be
distributed to colleges at least s i x weeks
before conference.
Critical look at education
system needed
A M O T I O N c a l l i n g on the N U S to take a
searching and c r i t i c a l look into the
education system a s a whole w a s
unanimously agreed to by the conference.
The motion identified four fundamental
issues affecting post school education
today v i z , the poor level of finance,
democracy, content and structure of
education.
Central validation of a l l further and
higher education courses and compulsory
part-time education for a l l workers
between 16 and 19 are c a l l e d for. T h e
latter c a l l w a s embodied in a s u c c e s s f u l
amendment sponsored by the Part Time
Students National Committee. It w a s
opposed by I C .
Mr R i c k P a r k e r , I C Union Academic
Affairs Officer, opposing the amendment
s a i d he objected to the word 'compulsory'.
The amend, said Mr Parker, was " a
rubbishy amendment".
The motion advocates continuous
assessment in favour of competitive
assessment. T h e abolition of the latter
should be the long term aim of the
National U n i o n . Examinations, the
resolution d e c l a r e s , " c a n restrict
educational opportunity and c a n ,
therefore, be detrimental to the community
as w e l l as the p a r t i c i p a n t s . " Examinations
only tested the candidates ability to
assimilate information.

On the question of course content,
the motion says " A l l courses must be
the subject of consultation between"
students, staff and representatives from
subsequent fields of work; students should
not be provided with 'terminal' courses
which become educational, 'blind a l l e y s '
wasteful in time, effort and r e s o u r c e s . "
Individual c o l l e g e s are instructed to
form content committees i n every
department with equal representation of
students academic and non-academic
staff. In addition, c o l l e g e s should set
departmental staff-student academic
boards which would be responsible for,
and take a l l d e c i s i o n s affecting the
department.
The motion also commits the N U S to
fighting against " t h e increasing control
of education by business and military
i n t e r e s t s . "
