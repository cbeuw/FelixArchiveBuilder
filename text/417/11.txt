Leonardo's Last Supper i s a R a b a l -
a i s i a n romp i n the charnel house at
Amboise, where Leonardo da V i n c i ' s
body h a s been brought. The glee of
the owner's family over the fame their
work w i l l bring them soon turns to despair
when it turns out that the master i s not
dead after a l l , however they q u i c k l y
restore the status quo. T h e actors put a
lot of spirit into the production and
carry the audience with them on a s e a
of enthusiasm.
Many students, it seems, cannot
survive more than ten minutes without a
cigarette. T h e audience i s distracted
by the flare of matches and the un-
pleasant atmosphere created in a
situation where the non-smokers are
stuck in their seats.
W E D N E S D A Y - The inhabitants of
Edinburgh seem to p o s s e s s a strong fear
of c r o s s i n g roads, perhaps motivated by
the apparent disorder in the traffic flow.
Cars a n d lorries come at me from a l l
directions.
A new play from St. Andrews — J a c e k
L a s k o w s k i ' s Galatea — or a s the
Scotsman apparently misprinted it
Gala Tea! T h e widow receives a v i s i t
from her brother-in-law and goes into a
neurotic monologue which i s as much a
trial for the audience as it must be for
the actress. T h e play leaves a lot of
confusion in its w a k e . I am worried
that the same record is played twice in
the play and once it contains guitar
m u s i c , the second time the Brahms
v i o l i n concerto; it i s these apparently
insignificant details that distract the
audience from absorbing the whole. In
the formal d i s c u s s i o n after the play
various conventions have to be explained
by the author/director/leading man; it
leaves me wondering what he w i l l do
when there i s no formal d i s c u s s i o n
after h i s p l a y s .
T H U R S D A Y - Martin E s s l i n , head o f
B B C radio and chairman of the Arts
Council Drama P a n e l talks on today's
theatre. T h e B r i t i s h Theatre has a great
lead over theatre in other countries
because of the b a s i s of tradition and
the c l a s h between the s u b s i d i s e d and
commercial sectors. There i s a d i s c u s s i o n
of the p o l i t i c a l power of theatre i n
Europe. It i s theatre, more than any other
medium, which c a n provide images and
make points that w i l l be remembered for
a long time.
T o the Traverse Theatre to see a new
play by Robert Pugh with h i s group from
Rose Bruford College of Speech and
Drama. The Key i s a remarkable play
with a tremendous force. Three Irishmen
dig up their hanged brother to recover a
key. T h e programme s a y s that the play
takes p l a c e i n County C l a r e , but the
appearance of E n g l i s h soldiers s e t s up
an uncontrollable resonance and con-
fusion in my mind. In the final scene
the brothers perch the corpse on a
chair behind the altar. After the soldiers
have taken away the ringleader, the
idiot brother, who has hidden under the
altar to e s c a p e detection, r i s e s from his
place o f concealment a s the priest mutters
h i s prayers. What a tremendous theatrical
moment when the priest turns to see the
corpse apparently come to life!
F R I D A Y — A n end of term spirit p r e v a i l s .
We d i s c u s s the next festival and there
i s what turns out to be a prize giving
ceremony, with mysterious envelopes
handed to the winners.
What h a s the F e s t i v a l achieved? A s a
showcase for the display of student
written and student-performed theatre
it h a s worked. There h a s been ample
time for d i s c u s s i o n and professional
opinions have been freely a v a i l a b l e .
At times the d i s c u s s i o n s have been i n
severe danger of drowning i n a s e a of
intellectual argument. What it a l l b o i l s
down to i s what goes on on the stage
and each member o f the a u d i e n c e ' s
response to that experience.
A s e r i e s of familiar names have
appeared and talked and d i s c u s s e d the
theatre but everyone has been very
polite to each other. There h a s c e r -
tainly been too much talk of theatre a s
an intellectual e x e r c i s e and not enough
on the practice of theatre.
My regrets are twofold; F i r s t l y that I
m i s s e d L e e d s U n i v e r s i t y ' s much
acclaimed performance of Gas, a German
e x p r e s s i o n i s t p i e c e of around 1920; and
secondly that I h a d to return to L o n d o n
without seeing John Hurt, the well-known
actor, who was scheduled to talk on
Saturday.
One of the inherent factors of a crowded
festival programme is that items are met
or missed suddenly and without preparation
L i t e r a l l y at the last minute I decided to
run a c r o s s to the other side of Edinburgh
for a final chance to see a piece of
German E x p r e s s i o n i s t i c drama from the
1 9 2 0 s - G e o r g K a i s e r ' s ' G a s ' . T h i s bit of
'impulse buying' turned up a rare and
fascinating purchase. German E x p r e s -
sionism is never s e e n on modern stages
because of its s c a l e , its unrelenting
verbal attack and sheer l a c k of objective
insight into character ,but L e e d s
U n i v e r s i t y should be congratulated for
taking these c h a l l e n g i n g problems and
g i v i n g as authentic a production a s
p o s s i b l e .
The p l a y , in its time, w a s a-.prophecy
of the doom w h i c h would result when a
world w a s destroyed by the exploding of
its entire energy resources - the gas of
the title. It is a prophecy which rings
true. T h e first hour of the play deals
with the aftermath of the e x p l o s i o n and
the confrontation of the two c e n t r a l
characters, the m i l l i o n a i r e ' s son and the
engineer-the former owns a l l the industry
ana determines that he w i l l not rebuild
it but replace it with a garden c i t y f a
modern-day conservationist and environ-
mentalist) while the engineer argues
that we must put up with o c c a s i o n a l
from future g a a e x p l o s i o n s i n order to
continue the technological advance of
c i v i l i s a t i o n . ( S u r e l y a v i t a l l y relevant
question for a c o l l e g e such a s ours.)
F o r the second half of the p l a y , we
were led out of the small T R A V E R S E
Theatre, along the drunks' quarter of
Edinbugh, at about 10 p m , past decaying
tenement b l o c k s and under P i r a n e s i a n
archways to a nearby h a l l where the
Workers' R i o t , l e d by the engineer, was
acted out, while the audience w a s forced
to stand for another hour.
The combined effect of aural and
v i s u a l a s s a u l t from words; white n o i s e ;
strobe lights; harsh, evocative, futuristic
sets and costumes, not to mentoin the
late night walk, a l l summed to produce
an overpowering effect and a theatrical
experience I s n a i l remember for a long
time.
