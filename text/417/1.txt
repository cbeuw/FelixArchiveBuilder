of the attacks having been

Student Spongers
S T U D E N T S C L A I M I N G Social
Security benefits have been
attacked by a Scottish student
newspaper.
The attackcame from Omega,
the newspaper of Heriot—Watt
U n i v e r s i t y , E d i n b u r g h .
According to an editorial p u b -
lished in i t s l a t e s t i s s u e ,
'betweenseventy and eighty per
centof those students (claiming
b e n e f i t ) w i l l have j u s t
hammered one more nail into
the coffin of the N a t i o n ' .
E x c u s e s usually given for
not finding a v a c a t i o n job
(especially during Christmas
and Easter) were d i s m i s s e d as
feeble and inadequate."Students
should be resourceful enough
to find sufficient time for their
academic work even if they are
working forty hours a w e e k " ,
the paper said. It was rarely
difficult, the paper c l a i m s , for
students to find work as say
barmen or petrol pump a t t e n -
dants if they tried.
C l a i m i n g benefit, the paper
s a y s , " i s an act of apathy and
s e l f i s h n e s s which jeopardises
not only their own future but
that of the entire nation'.'
It described as " m o s t
d e s p i c a b l e " the r e a s o n ,
" I f I took a job I would be
depriving someone else of the
right to work and consequently
worsening the unemployment
s i t u a t i o n " . It would cost the
nation nearly £21 million if
everystudent received only the
minimumentitlementduring the
E a s t e r v a c a t i o n a l o n e .
A n N U S spokesman,however,
disagreed with the points made
by Omega. T h e unemployment
l e v e l had h i t students badly
and the situation was so bad
that traditional employers,such
as the big stores and hte G P O
had offered very few jobs
during the Christmas v a c a t i o n .
The N U S see s o c i a l security
as a safety net for those on l o w
pay and fixed incomes. The
spokesman a l s o pointed out that
according to their survey, 57%
of students on mandatory awards
did not receive the full parental
contribution to their grant. H a l f
the student population d i d not
receive the vacation element,
£3.80 per week for those on a
full grant, as a result.
Ms Sue Slipman, N U S Natio-
nal Secretary, said yesterday;
"I believe that anyone who is
supposed to serve the interests
of students could do that better
than by attacking students
who are victims of the present
crisis, along with the vast
majority of working people in
this country.
