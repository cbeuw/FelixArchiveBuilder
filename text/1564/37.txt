PISCES
This week you have an exam,
it goes badly. You go home
and revise furiously, Physics,
Medicine, Mech Eng., anything
you can find lecture notes
online for. It becomes an
obsession, you just can’t stop.
It was a prostate exam.
This week you wonder
why your sex tape wasn’t
nominated for an Oscar.
Sure it was shot on a small
budget, but you’d spent
ages on the script and had
tried really hard making sure
it passed the Bechdel test.
You show it to your parents
who disagree.
This week you decide to put
all of your money into Bitcoin.
The value of your Bitcoins
increases 1000x and you
decide to celebrate by going
to a lap dancing club. While
you are in the club the value
of your Bitcoin crashes to
zero. Left with no money to
pay for your private dance,
you are forced to work there
until you graduate.
This week you wake up and
realize that you are a cunt. Well,
your parents told you for long
enough. And your personal
tutor that one time. And your
sister. And the Sunday Times.
That was an awkward weekend
with Giles and Victoria Coren.
Oh well.
This week you decide to drop
out of Imperial and start a new
career in dance. You’re not sure
whether the Royal Academy of
Dance has a twerking course,
but you’re such a pioneer
you decide to press ahead
regardless. 20 years from now
you realise it’s the best decision
you ever made as you twerk to a
sold out Wembley Stadium.
This week you use a
homophobic slur at the
Cambridge Union, continuing
your rebellion against the
political elite. Since nobody
takes you seriously anyway
you’re very upset at the under
reaction to your headline
grabbing attempt. You get in
the Daily Mail at least, behind
the Benefits Street article.
This week you will meet a
mysterious stranger and go
on a journey this week. This
is a horoscope, so this jour-
ney can be metaphorical if
you’re not actually going on
a journey. And the stranger,
they can be metaphorical too.
You will have both good luck
and bad, you know like ev-
eryone else in the world ever.
This week you’re so excited about
the new Game of Thrones trailer
that you don’t talk about anything
else for the next 3 weeks. Your
friends stop talking to you but
that’s fine, Jon Snow didn’t have
any friends to start with either.
You try and see if your sister is
a fan too, but the Cersei and
Jamie roleplay is a step too far.
This week you decide it’s time
to give your parents a call for
the first time since they kicked
you out over Christmas. The
phone is answered by your
replacement, who sounds so
much better than you do. He’s
studying at Cambridge, and
already has a job lined up at a
bank. You cry yourself to sleep
while working out how to kill him.
This week you will meet a mysteri-
ous stranger and go on a journey
this week. Both the stranger and
the journey are completely real
this time. Unfortunately, this is a
journey to an abandoned abat-
toir in rural Hertfordshire, locked
in the boot of a car. The stranger
is a serial killer, but on the bright
side you’ll finally get on TV
when they find what’s left of you.
You are very pleased to have
won a Golden Globe this
week. However, as you have
never been in a film or on
TV this perplexes you. You
realize that you have a talent
for winning things you aren’t
qualified for, so you decide to
run for a Sabbatical position.
This week you learn about
the debate between pie
and tau. You try and use
it to pick someone up in
Metric. It’s the nearest to
success you’ve ever come
at Imperial, but unfortunately
they’re just more of sigma.

Captured US Soldier Has No
Idea How Breaking Bad Ended
F
rancois Hollande’s alleged
affair with Julie Gayet has
given newspaper writers
across the country free reign
to dust off their GCSE B in
French and treat us all to the worst
Franglais the can imagine.
Whether it’s the Telegraph’s
“éléphant dans la salle”, the Guardian
proclaiming “Vive l’Entente Cordiale!”
or even the BBC’s helpful guide to all
the vocabulary you’re going to need
to follow the story (“Gauche caviar”
is apparently the French equivalent of
champagne Socialists) they’ve all been
at it.
Of course the real news story here is
that Hollande got this far into his term
without being accused of cheating.
It’s so common for French politicians
that upon election they’re provided
with a free Ashley Madison account.
For those of you who don’t know what
Ashley Madison is, Google it and
rediscover that the world is a horrible
place.
I wonder whether the French media
reports on our stories similarly, with
lists of required vocabulary like
“benefit scroungers” and “plebgate”.
Thankfully the word for paedophile
is the same, so our French neighbours
can easily learn about everyone on TV
in the 70s.
A
video showing that
US Sergeant Bowe
Bergdahl has been held
in Taliban captivity
for the last four
years has been released. Staff at the
Pentagon have been making urgent
investigations into his safety, location,
and whether he even knows the
premise of Breaking Bad.
‘What we’re dealing with here, is
nothing short of a crisis.’ announced
General Hapablap at a press
conference this morning, ‘We need
to know where this man is, and how
far into the show he’s gotten. We are
prepping the Navy Seals with Spoiler
Prevention sniper teams as I speak.’
‘Nobody, and I mean nobody who
proudly serves their country should
have to find out from Facebook.’
A spokesperson at the CIA
commented on the situation, saying
‘We’re currently in talks with the UN
Council on Human Rights to establish
whether TV spoilers are a form of
torture.
Until we find him, however, there’s
nothing we can do but prepare for his
return to the US. We’ve got the whole
of Homeland on our Netflix, and we’re
studying up. We just hope that when
the time comes, we’re able to cry as
unconvincingly as Clare Danes.’
Bryan Cranston was not impressed
