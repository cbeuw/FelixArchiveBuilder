Maybe you should sleep on it...
Matilda Hay looks at new research on sleep and memory consilidation
D
id you, like everyone else,
vow to get more sleep
this year? Sleeping is
common to all animals
and a vital part of staying
healthy and alert. However, when we
sleep we are missing opportunities to
be more productive, and by switching
off we leave ourselves vulnerable to
attack.
It must be a very important process
to be worth all of these risks but what
is actually happening while we sleep?
When we learn something new,
connections between the synapses
involved are strengthened so that
the learned pathway will be activated
more easily next time. This is the basis
of memory.
Sleep is known to be important for
consolidating short-term memories
into long term memories, and it used
to be thought that we did this by
replaying and strengthening those
connections during our sleep.
However, sleep experts at Wisconsin
University have challenged the
theory that sleeping strengthens
the connections in our brain. Drs
Tononi and Cirelli propose a ‘synaptic
homeostasis hypothesis’ (SHY) which
suggests that sleep is important for
weakening the connections in our
brain, and resetting the synapses back
to normal (hence the reference to
homeostasis).
However, if we are resetting all
our synaptic connections, how do
we remember anything? They study
shows that significant learning

experiences are dampened less than
trivial experiences; overall those
connections will be stronger relative
to the rest. This also helps to explain
the phenomena of ‘smart forgetting’
where our brain rids itself of
unimportant details that accumulate
each day.
But why would our brains need
to reset? One reason is an energy
benefit. To transmit a signal across
a synapse neurons must release
chemical neurotransmitters.
Stronger connections release more
neurotransmitters and this requires
more energy. By dampening down
all of our synaptic connections we
reduce the energy demands on the cell
without losing the relative strength of
the signal.
Another reason has to do with the
fact that nerve cells are essentially
binary – either they fire an impulse
or they don’t. They will only fire an
impulse when they are stimulated
above a certain threshold level, either
by other neurons or by sensory inputs.
If the synaptic connection is made
stronger between two neurons then
less of a stimulus is required to trigger
the threshold in the receiving neuron.
This means that old learning would
drown out possible new connections
and interfere with our ability to learn
new things.
The new SHY hypothesis helps to
answer several questions that the
‘active strengthening’ hypothesis
couldn’t. Essentially the old idea
was that while asleep, ‘replays’ of
recent waking activity patterns in the
synapses would ‘instruct’ learning.
But these replays have been seen
to occur while we are awake, so why
would sleep be so necessary? If there
are also many other spontaneous
firings that occur, how does our
sleeping brain distinguish these from
genuine replays? Furthermore, replays
during sleep decline rapidly after
the first hour. If their purpose is to
strengthen our memory then why do
they fade so quickly?
With the SHY hypothesis, a feedback
method has been proposed so that
as the neurons fire spontaneously
through the night, the stronger
connections preserve themselves and
are dampened less than weak ones.
This explains how the learning could
be easily preserved.
Tononi and Cirelli have taken into
account evidence from behavior,
physiological studies and computer
simulations too, and so far their
hypothesis looks promising. However
they have acknowledged that it could
be wrong, particularly if we find out
that synaptic resetting could occur
while we are awake. For example,
having only some circuits of our brain
engaged on a task and the ‘offline’ ones
resetting themselves would suggest
that something else important is going
on while we sleep, something that
cannot occur whilst we are awake.
This study is just one of many that
is looking at the reasons behind why
we sleep, and there are still lots of
unresolved mysteries as to why we
need our recommended eight hours
a night.
However, according to the Great
British Sleep Survey 2012 most of
us are only averaging 5.1 hours, so if
reading this hasn’t sent you to sleep
yet, go and get an early night!
Hypervelocity stars discovered trying to escape the galaxy
Emma Wills

20 candidates for a new type of
hypervelocity star have been
announced by an international team
of astronomers.
These are stars travelling fast enough
to completely escape our galaxy’s
gravitational field, which means
travelling at more than six hundred
kilometres per second relative to the
galaxy.
Previously discovered hypervelocity
stars are thought to have been
accelerated by the supermassive black
hole at our galactic centre, but the
newly announced stars appear to be
travelling in all directions, none of
them from the centre of the galaxy.
Neither do they seem to have come
from the black hole of our closest large
galactic neighbour, the Andromeda
galaxy.
Possible mechanisms for their
speed include a binary system where
one of the stars goes supernova and
ejects its companion, or a single star
that encounters a binary pair of black
holes. It is hoped that observations of
their spectra may give clues to their
origin.
The candidates were identified
by the Sloan Sky Survey, and were
spotted by looking at their angular
speed relative to the centre of the
galaxy, which had not been focused
on before. This method can come with
large errors, but a number of statistical
tests were run to check the accuracy of
the velocities.
“We think that although some of
our candidates may
be flukes, the majority
are real”, said Lauren
Palladino, the lead
author of the paper.
An additional puzzle
comes from the size of
these stars – they are
all much smaller than
the hypervelocity stars
known to come from
the galactic centre.
If the theory of the
previously discovered
hypervelocity stars
is correct, then there
should be a range of
sizes of star ejected
from the centre of our
galaxy. These smaller
stars are still being
searched for.
