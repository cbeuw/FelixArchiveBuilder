With a bewildering array of gaming accessories on the market, it can be difficult to find out
which one is best to purchase for your particular needs and the Steelseries 9H is a good start

Steelseries. It’s a name all gamers are
familiarwith,andit’sacompanywhich
deals with all aspects of a gamers
needs by providing good quality
peripherals and accessories. The
Steelseries 9H is a top range headset
from the H series of tournament grade
headsets provided by Steelseries and
has been available only as of late 2013.
Starting with the aesthetics, the
9H looks like a heavy duty headset
which has padded ear cups thick with
leather cushions used to isolate noise
in a passive fashion, encompassed
by a durable plastic sheath around
each ear cup which can resist a
sizeable amount of wear and tear. The
black on orange is a characteristic
Steelseries colour combination and
it functions very well, producing a
great overall look. The headband is
an iconic design emblazoned with
the Steelseries logo and is complete
with four discrete cushions which
are, similar to the ear cups, very
soft and do make it very easy to last
long gaming sessions without having
the need to readjust or remove the
headset. It is of a great overall
build quality, as the sturdiness
of the outer shell coupled
with the luxurious cushions
definitely makes it feel like
a high quality headset.
The bass and the
treble quality produced
by the 9H exceed
the price tag of the
headset. It functions
like professional
h e a d p h o n e s
when listening
to electronic
music, however
the highs aren’t
as crisp as would
be preferred,
however this
is a minor
issue which can
be overlooked
considering the
headset is not designed
with music in mind, and
the infrequent highs in
games means that it wouldn’t
normally be noticeable. The
bass feels
richer, however it
surprisingly does not
detract from the overall
sound quality which is a
combination rarely achieved by
headphones. The headset boasts
virtual Dolby 7.1 surround sound,
which significantly enhances
the gaming
experience and allows elevated
precision pinpointing of sound
origins, a critical feature which I
personally found to greatly add to
the experience of games. This
is facilitated by the addition
of a USB sound card with
the headset which is an
optional feature, but
allows for a wealth of
customisation to suit
the user’s needs. An
equaliser is provided to
easily adjust the sound
settings for different
game types and
different needs, and
a host of microphone
settings are provided
which can reduce
ambient noise as
well as automated
m i c r o p h o n e
c o m p r e s s i o n
which allows for a
constant microphone
volume across different
communication software,
removing the need to fiddle
around with settings on different
VoIP programs, all in a simple user
friendly piece of software downloaded
from the Steelseries website.
The microphone is one aspect of
the 9H which was average at best.
The quality is very good, and the
background noise reduction is highly
effective, however in the midst of
these settings, the true sound of
the voice is somewhat distorted
and does not clearly represent the
voice of the user. It must be added
that the unidirectional nature
of the microphone is a fantastic
feature and definitely helps to pick
up only what needs to be heard.
Overall the Steelseries 9H is a
perfect accessory to all varieties of
gamers and is a solid purchase. At
£130 it is not the cheapest headset out
there, but it is a worthy investment for
those looking to buy a good headset
to last them for a long time. They are
durable and provide a high sound
quality, and with their swappable
cables they can be taken on the go to
listen to music, not restricting their
use on the computer. The lacking
microphone quality and the slightly
lacklustre highs are the only issues
with an overall outstanding headset,
and it therefore gets a score of 8.5/10.
