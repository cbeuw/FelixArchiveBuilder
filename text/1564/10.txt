Denial on ice: the polar vortex of confusion
Philippa Skett discusses the views of the global warming deniers in the USA

The Niagara Falls rendered stationary by the cold front of the Polar Vortex
T
he polar vortex that swept
across North America
this holiday was one that
left both the ground and
politicians rather frosty,
albeit for different reasons.
As the temperatures dropped and
ice hardened across the country,
more and more famous faces
appeared across the media denying
global warming. Many justified their
arguments by pointing out what they
considered to be the obvious: how can
we be causing global warming when it
is just so cold?
200 million people were affected
by the snow storm that plunged
temperatures to as low as -12°
C in
Chicago last week, with over a dozen
deaths reported as a direct result of
the weather. The Niagara Falls were
brought to an icy standstill, schools
and workplaces across the country
were closed and thousands of flights
were grounded. The economic impact
the storm had was estimated at
around $5 billion.
The cause of the cold was the
breakdown of the Arctic polar vortex.
Polar vortices are actually persistent
cyclones permanently located at the
geographical poles of the Earth. They
are cold-core, low pressure areas of
the stratosphere that are caused by the
differences in temperatures between
the equator and the poles, and span
around 1,000 km in size.
The breakdown was triggered
by a sudden temperature increase
in the polar stratosphere, causing
the westerly winds of the vortex to
reverse due to alterations in the usual
pressure differences. The vortex
spread southward, outward beyond its
usual confines of the Arctic Circle to
encompass Northern Europe as well
as North America, with cold fronts
being felt as far south as Florida.
Despite the localised effects being a
decrease in temperature, the overall
shift of the polar vortex may have
actually been an example, albeit
counterintuitive, of global warming
in action, something concurrent with
the consensus on climate change
taken by the scientific community.
A recent study looked at papers
peer-reviewed and published about
the climate in the past year, and found
that out of 2259 articles, from 9136
authors, only one of those scientists
did not believe global warming to
be a reality. However, this pales in
comparison to the numbers of people
from both the mainstream US media
and politics who also deny global
warming in the wake of the arctic
weather conditions.
Donald Trump, the well-known
American investor and real state
entrepreneur, the stateside equivalent
of Sir Alan Sugar on The Apprentice,
and rumoured presidential candidate
for 2016, took to twitter to say this of
the USA’s cold snap:
The Fox News website, never one
to stay out of an argument, chose its
side of the debate by publishing an
opinion piece by Matt Patterson, the
senior editor at the Capital Research
Center, stating that “global warming is
the most widespread mass hysteria in
our species’ history.”
Others decided to link those
considering global warming to be a
reality as deluded as those who believe
that Jesus will not return in some sort
of glorious second coming:
Meanwhile, Republican Sen. James
Inhofe of Oklahoma, who once built
an igloo in his garden labelled “Al
Gore’s new home,” stated that climate
change is apparently a harmless act of
God, and stated that the polar vortex
breakdown was further evidence that
global warming is a “hoax.”
He went on to interrupt a debate
over unemployment insurance in
Senate last week, to offer up the
seemingly relevant insight that it’s
“a little bit humorous to me that
we are talking about extending
unemployment benefits in the midst
of one of the most intense cold fronts
in American history…It has to make
everyone question…whether global
warming was ever real.” Such words
resonated with particular discomfort
due to the fact that Inhofe is currently
a ranking member of the Senate
Environment and Public Works
Committee.
In fact, over one hundred state
representatives have been on the
record denying global warming, whilst
24 Senate members have also voiced
distrust in what is universally accepted
by the scientific community. Some of
the more damning quotes
made by these politicians
include:
“There isn’t any real
science to say we are
altering the climate path
of the earth.” (Sen. Roy
Blunt)
“[Scientists] are making
up their facts to fit their
conclusions. They’ve
already caught them doing
this,
” (Sen. Rand Paul)
“I do not think the science clearly
supports global warming theory.
” (Sen.
David Vitter)
“Global warming has not been
proven to the satisfaction of the
constituents I seek to serve.
” (Rep. Trey
Gowdy)
Other politicians may agree with
the scientific community, but still
struggle to see the importance of
climate change, or simply flounder
when formulating intelligent opinions
on the matter. Louisiana Sen. Mary
Landrieu has previously
urged President Obama
to stop the Democratic
Party focussing on climate
change entirely, whilst
Minnesota Rep. Collin
Peterson stated that global
warming will be good for
farmer’s crops, as the
warmer weather will allow
them to grow more corn.
Luckily those with the
ultimate power were
quick to step in on the
debate. Obama’s science advisor John
Holdren stated in a two minute video
in a blog released by the White House
on Wednesday that “If you’ve been
hearing that extreme cold spells like
the one we’re having in the United
States now disprove global warming,
don’t believe it.”
The blog went on to say that “…This
week’s cold spell is of a type there’s
reason to believe may become more
frequent in a world that’s getting
warmer, on average, because of
greenhouse-gas pollution.”
Encouragingly, the White House
has also arranged a Google+ hangout
today (Friday the 17th) to publically
debunk claims that the harsh winter
spell was proof that climate change
does not exist. The discussion,
called “We the Geeks,” will feature
government officials and independent
scientists in a final bid to push back
against the climate change deniers
that have been allowed such a grand
platform in the American mainstream
media.
Although this may raise further
concerns around why the most
powerful people in the USA are
using dysfunctional social media
constructs to debate international
issues, it is a positive step forward.
It is also a step that not only shows
that the US government is ignoring
the incorrect opinions of Trump and
others, but adds to the greater efforts
the US government is finally taking to
counteract global warming.
Obama recently introduced the
Global Climate Change Initiative,
outlining the promise to invest
more in technologies aiding climate
adaptation whilst simultaneously
reducing emissions, and also ensuring
the sustainability of economic growth
in climate sensitive sectors.
The Secretary of State, John Kerry
has always been passionate about
climate change too; after he negotiated
an agreement with China to stop
hydrofluorocarbon usage, he plans
to aid the implementation of a new
climate treaty in 2015 that will commit
the USA, and others, to significantly
reduce fossil fuel pollution.
With US economics driven by oil
and coal it is easy to see why those
who benefit from fossil fuel sales
most may turn a blind eye or even
deny the long-term effects of fossil
fuel burning. However, no amount of
tweets, debates or comment pieces
are going to discredit the increasing
scientific evidence that global
warming is a very real, and a very
damaging phenomenon.
It seems that this polar vortex
brought with it not only a front of
icy winds and snowy storms, but also
a new wave of scientific ignorance
within the depths of American politics
that, if not addressed, will persist long
after the Niagara Falls begin to flow
once more.
