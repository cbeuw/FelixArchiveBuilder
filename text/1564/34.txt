E
very 20 minutes, someone
in the UK is told they have
a blood cancer. That’s 70
people a day, 25,000 people
a year.
Blood cancers can be life-
threatening as they leave patients with
few functioning blood cells. Although
extensive chemotherapy may work,
for many replacing these cells is the
only way forward. Only about 30%
of people in need can find a suitable
Marrow Volunteers
needed
donor within their family, which
means that 70% rely on the kindness
and generosity of strangers to save
their lives.
Marrow, the student branch of the
Anthony Nolan Trust, work hard to
help this 70% by recruiting students
here at Imperial onto the national
bone marrow register. For every 100
people we recruit, 1 can go on to save
the life of someone in need. All it takes
to register is filling out a simple form
Free Books and Other
Events from Sci-Fi Soc
W
hat could be
better than
curling up with
a good book?
That’s right,
curling up with a good book that you
got for free! That’s why the Science
Fiction, Fantasy and Gothic Horror
Society is bringing back our hugely
popular Book Blind Date event. Last
October we found new homes for over
fifty great books and this term it’s all
going to be even bigger and better.
Come along to the Beit Hall entrance
archway at 12:30 on Wednesday,
January 22 to pick up your free, high
quality second hand book. All the
books will be tightly wrapped to make
what you’re getting a surprise. Your
only clue will be a set of keywords
written on the wrapping paper. But
don’t worry – we’ll make sure that
there’s something for everyone. So,
whether you’re interested in dying-
Earth science fiction, magical realism,
Lovecraftian horror or any other sub-
genre, come along to see what we
have. Last time the event was very
popular so be sure to turn up early to
avoid missing your chance to pick up
a free book.
If your free gift stirs up your passion
for genre fiction don’t forget to check
out library in the Beit West Basement.
Open every weekday in term time
from noon to 2pm, and often also in
the evenings, it’s the perfect place to
meet up with likeminded people and
watch some of your favourite films and
television shows on our widescreen
TV. We have a collection of over 9000
books and 2000 DVDs, which can be
borrowed by any of our members.
For more information about the
other great events that we run
throughout the year check out our
website at icsf.org.uk. The highlight
of our calendar is our annual literary
convention, Picocon, now in its thirty
first year. Picocon 31 will be taking
place on Saturday, February 22, with
the theme of ‘Survival’. Guests of
Honour will be Sarah Pinborough (The
Dog-Faced Gods Trilogy, Mayhem),
Charles Stross (The Laundry Files
series, Accelerando) and Professor
David Southwood (President of the
Royal Astronomical Society and
Patron of the SF Foundation). Come
along for a full day of talks, panel
discussions, silly games, quizzes and
much, much more. Tickets are now on
sale from the Union website.
Sci-Fi soc tell us about their exciting events
and giving us a spit sample. If called
forward, donation has never been
easier: in more than 90% of cases, cells
are collected in a similar way to how
you might donate blood. Donors are
simply hooked up to a machine which
filters the blood, taking out the cells
that are needed!
If you would like to register our next
recruitment event is on Thursday the
30th of January from 10am until 6pm
in the Union Dining Hall, Beit Quad!
