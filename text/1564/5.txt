A
fter a search by College
Council through an
international list of
candidates, Professor
Alice P. Gast, President
of Lehigh University and former Vice
President for Research and Associate
Provost at MIT is set to step into the
role of President of Imperial College.
Professor Gast will be College’s first
female President/Rector in it’s 106
year history.
Professor Gast, having spent seven-
and-a-half years as President of
Lehigh, a private research university
based in Bethelhem, Pensylvannia,
said: “With its unique focus on
science, engineering, medicine and
business, and its integrated mission to
teach, research and translate its work
for the benefit of society, Imperial has
a great leadership role in the world...”
However, one question that plagues
the minds of some in the Education
industry is the potential value of her
renumeration. In recent years there
has been a trend toward British
universities paying relatively high
wages to incoming American senior
management staff.
In comparison to incumbent
President & Rector Sir Keith O’Nions’
total compensation of £323,000 in
the 2011-12 financial year, Professor
Gast received a total compensation
package that year worth £711,721 (at
current exchange rates), which lead to
the Times Higher Education asking a
tight-lipped College spokesperson for
more information.
President-designate Professor
Gast’s appointment comes after
recent structural changes to the
leadership roles at College which saw
the role of Rector being split into two
separate roles: President and Provost,
as announced by College Council
in April 2012. These roles split the
responsibility of the Rector into the
public-facing President position,
which is ultimately responsible for
all College activities and cultivates
relationships with the business and
political worlds, and the academia-
focused Provost, who reports to the
President and manages College’s
academic mission.
The new President-designate and
the current Provost Professor James
Stirling, former Head of Physics at the
University of Cambridge are replacing
the current President & Rector,
Professor Sir Keith O’Nions FRS,
who is retiring from the position after
four-and-a-half years at Imperial’s top
position. Professor Sir O’Nions will be
stepping down in September 2014.

C
hristened the London
Forum for Science
and Policy (LFSP) and
launching this year,
Imperial’s first student
think tank carefully sidesteps the
university’s trap of a neocolonial-
sounding name. At a time when
policymakers are increasingly
criticised for their poor use of
evidence, LFSP will infuse Imperial’s
first love, science, with a new, political
edge. In turn LFSP plans to inject
the political sphere with some of the
university’s world-famous scientific
rigour.
A familiar phrase among budding
policy wonks (as they’re known in the
trade), for many students the words
‘think tank’ might instead conjure up
images of schools of brain-fish floating
and pondering blissfully in a basin. Far
from this watery utopia, think tanks
lie in the intellectual no-man’s-land
somewhere between an academic
policy unit and a full-blown lobbying
group. Along with undertaking
research into government policies,
they then go about making practical
recommendations for how policy
could be improved in future.
Crucially, unlike many other think
tanks, LFSP is non-partisan and
encourages perspectives from across
the political spectrum. It provides
students with an arena to combine
their scientific knowledge and political
judgements into well-developed
policy recommendations culminating
in a written paper, pitched to experts
in the field at monthly talks.
With King’s College London already
leading the way in terms of London
student think tanks, it’s about time
that Imperial students stepped into
the fray to put some hard facts behind
the policies of today.

SCIENCE
I
f you ever wondered how giant
LEGO models are made, Warren
Elsmore’s book Brick City shows
you how! The book travels
the world in different LEGO
models, starting in San Francisco and
ending in Japan, showing recognisable
landmarks built from LEGO along
the way. One of the biggest models
is Westminster Abbey, built from
180,000bricksandfilledwithhundreds
of minifigures. Created in 2011 for the
Royal Wedding, it includes working
clocks and stained glass windows.
Other models include a 120,000 piece
St. Pancras station with an oyster bar
and working Eurostar trains.
The author, Warren Elsmore, will
be giving a guest lecture in Huxley
311 on Tuesday at 6:30pm for
LEGOSoc. He will be explaining how
to translate these existing building
into giant LEGO models. Warren is
a professional LEGO builder with
years of experience. He’s built a huge
number of impressive models and
displayed them all over the world.
He’s also the president and conference
organiser of Brickish, the UK’s official
LEGO user group.
