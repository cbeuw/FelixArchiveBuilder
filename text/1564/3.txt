Imperial hosts new
cybersecurity institute
I
mperial is to host a new centre
focussed on preventing cyber
attacks against UK industry
and infrastructure. The new
centre will be artfully named the
Research Institute into Trustworthy
Industrial Control Systems and will
focus on preventing cyber attacks on
large infrastructure such as nuclear
power and the national rail.
Professor Chris Hankin, director of
the new institute, said: “Our industrial
control systems are vital for running
most of the industrial processes that
underpin modern society. From
electricity generation to making sure
trains run on time, these systems are
vital to our everyday lives, but more
work needs to be done to determine
how vulnerable they are to threats
from cyber-attack.”
As engineers have sought
more realtime information from
infrastructure, such as railways,
systems are become increasingly
interconnected, leaving them with
more vulnerabilities. As well as
attacks on infrastructure, the institute
will investigate the impact that a cyber
attack on a single firm can have in
triggering a domino effect on other
businesses further downstream.
The threat and destructive potential
of a cyber attack is very real. As Prof.
Hankin pointed out, commenting
on the new centre: “In 2007, parts
of Estonia ground to a halt when it
experienced a ‘denial of service’ cyber-
attack, overloading servers, which
lead to a temporary government
shutdown. While this is an extreme
example, it highlights how vulnerable
countries are to these types of threats.”

New funding for UK research insti-
tutions has been announced by the
Minister of State for Universities and
Science, David Willetts. During a
visit to Imperial College last Friday,
Willetts announced the formation of
nineteen new Centres for Doctoral
Training (CDT) which will be funded
through the Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)
with the money ultimately sourced
primarily from industry partners.
CDTs are an increasingly common
means of providing PhD student-
ships – with each centre offering a
four year course in a particular area
of science and engineering, focusing
on research but also including taught
elements.
Willetts was keen to stress that:
“the Government will be investing
in a further 900 students through an
additional 19 Centres for Doctoral
Training (CDTs), bringing our
total investment in CDTs to £390
million”. Professor David Delpy, Chief
Executive of the EPSRC, added that:
“these new CDTs will provide training
and advances in research in many
areas of science and engineering
including quantum technologies,
manufacturing, robotics, energy and
sustainability and bring the total
number of Centres funded in this
round to ninety one.”
Three of the centres – focusing
on Plastic Electronic Materials,
Sustainable Civil Engineering and
Nuclear Engineering – will be based
at Imperial. In a statement Professor
James Stirling, College Provost, said:
“Securing a further three CDTs to
add to the seven already awarded
cements Imperial’s position as a
leader in postgraduate education and
research, helping to produce the next
generation of scientists, engineers
and industrialists who will drive the
UK’s economic recovery.”
While touring the Department
of Aeronautics, Willetts also
announced the formation of a new
National Wind Tunnel Facility,
which will bring together Imperial,
Oxford, Cambridge and four other
universities. The College has a long
tradition of wind tunnel research with
Bluebird-Proteus CN7, the car which
broke the land speed record in 1964,
having been tested here. Imperial will
receive £4million of the £13.3million
dedicated to this new project, which
will be used to improve the its five
existing wind tunnels.

Minister announces new
research opportunities
David Willetts uses visit to Imperial to announce the
creation of new Doctoral Training Centres
said: “The Government’s much
needed investment in the nation’s
leading wind tunnel facilities will
have a transformative effect and
drive innovation across a broad
range of sectors in a variety of
fields. At Imperial, this will help us,
for instance, to design bridges that
can better withstand wind induced
vibrations and more efficient wind
turbines, and to develop better
aircraft wings that improve fuel
efficiency.” Stirling added: “Imperial’s
wind tunnels have historically played
a pivotal role in the development of
Formula One car design, with many of
our graduates going on to important
careers in the industry. New funding
will help secure our global advantage
in this field, fostering greater capacity
and driving forward much needed
research in a range of areas, from
green energy to more fuel efficient
aircraft.”
Willetts emphasised the economic
importance of the new funding,
saying: “This new investment will
support research that is vital to the
UK economy, including developing
the next generation of fuel efficient
heavy goods vehicles. This will create
huge energy savings to businesses,
as well as bringing environmental
benefits. It is pioneering work that
will help the UK get ahead in the
global race.”
