Lords Science Select Committee opens
inquiry on International STEM Students
I
mperial College Union has helped
secure an inquiry by the House
of Lords for the Science and
Technology Committee.
The Union has been
campaigning against the Immigration
Bill since last November after a paper
was passed at Council opposing the
proposed changes that will negatively
impact our international students.
Furthermore, the Union has been
working alongside the NUS and their
campaign for International students.
Imperial Union has been lobbying
Lords linked to Imperial. Our
sabbatical officers spoke to Robert
Winston regarding the concerns
the Union had about the impact the
proposed Immigration Bill will have
on International students if passed. On
Tuesday, Robert Winston raised these
issues with The House of Lord’s Science
and Technology Select committee; this
resulted in an inquiry that has now
been launched.
Marissa Lewis, Deputy President
(Welfare) commented: “This has
been a fantastic outcome of a lot of
work which all started with a student
working group putting a paper through
our Union Council – I hope everyone
whohasbeeninvolvedinthiscampaign
feels heartened by this news”
The inquiry will look at the effect new
immigration rules could potentially
have on international students, as well
as examining the development in the
collection and analysis of data relating
to student migration. Our Union will
be putting forward a response that will
be evidence for this inquiry.
Daniel Stevens, the NUS
International Officer commented:
“Thanks to lobbying by Imperial Union,
the inquiry will provide an important
avenue to show how detrimental the
Immigration Bill is for international
students. It is an excellent development
in the continued fight against the
Immigration Bill.”

C
ollege has set up a
consultation process to
review the “residential
experience” at Imperial.
The review process will
be conducted by a panel chaired by
Professor Myra McClure, College
Consul from the Faculty of Medicine
(non-clinical) and includes the
Union’s President and Deputy
President (Welfare), David Goldsmith
and Marissa Lewis. The panel also
includes Ian Spencer, Director of
Residential Services at LSE, who has
extensive knowledge about university
accommodation best practices after
a similar review carried out at LSE in
the last year.
The purpose of the review will be to
shape the residential experience for
students in College accommodation

and will set out a plan of action for the
recommended changes. This report
will be submitted to the Vice Provost
for Education Debra Humphris’
Advisory Group who will bring the
recommendations to the Provost’s
Board.
AccordingtotheTermsofReference,
while reviewing the residential
experience the panel will: consider
evidence and make recommendations
on areas where current practices can
be enhanced, make recommendations
about the role of residential staffing in
accommodation, review various parts
of the administration of the residential
experience, ensuring accountability
for service delivery, and review the
communication of the residential
experience to current and prospective
students.
The panel will cover a wide range
of issues, including the operational
activities supporting the residential
experience, residential staff
accommodation,residentialresources,
College’s responsibilities to students
in terms of the accommodation
licence and a service level agreement.
The review will be presented to the
Provost’s board on the 28th of March,
in time to be implemented for next
year’s academic cycle (if approved).
This however means that there is a
limited time for some stakeholders
(especially students) to provide
feedback before the panel reviews
the evidence. Student feedback will
be collected by the Union by the 6th
of February, who will report their
findings to the panel on the second
day of evidence. Some students have
welcomed the review, however several
have been concerned about the
relatively short duration of the review
and would welcome a longer future
consultation period which would be
able to cover a wider range of issues.
If you would like to submit feedback
to the panel, fill out the Union’s online
form by Feb 6th:
