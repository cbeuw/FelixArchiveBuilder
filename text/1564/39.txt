FRIDAY 17 JAN
SPORT
IC put Bristol mini-tour to full use
At 2pm on Friday 22nd November
the first impatient members of the
mini-tour arrived in the union, for
a live #AskMattCann. Like moths
to a flame the remaining 34 touring
rangers arrived to finally set eyes on
the fabled tour tops. A rather fetching
yellow and black number had been
hand-picked from the literally tens of
other options, and was met with looks
of disgust from some and approving
discussions of where it sat on the
ICUAFC Kit Pengness scale from
others.
Once everyone had arrived we
made the short trip to Paddington
to board what rumours had said was
the busiest train in the country. These
viscous rumours were soon shown
to be true and a hasty free first class
upgrade for half the team was the
only way to get standing room, let
alone an excellently reserved seat. The
unsuspecting members of the First
Class quiet carriage were shown a
wonderful display of train box, one of
the harder disciplines of the game.
After arriving in Bristol 1 hour and
43 minutes after leaving Paddington,
we made our way to the hostel, which
was a literal stone’s throw from the
destination for that evening, Pryzm.
Despite being voted the second worst
student night in the UK, IC were
not to be disheartened and entered
looking for a stage to dominate. After
kicking up a fuss about the dire lack of
a stage, Frosty had a tiny disagreement
with the door staff and promptly put
himself under house arrest.
The game day was finally upon us,
but the club Pimp had forgotten all his
essential kit so a last minute dash to
Sports Direct was undertaken, and a
very late decision to purchase a ball
would later be totally vindicated.
The bus journey took in some
of Bristol’s more cultured sights,
including the cathedral, a Banksy and
the museum, before dropping us near
the middle of nowhere. It was here
however we discovered that Georgie,
one of the netball social secs, had had
so much fun at a previous football
event that she followed us the 120 odd
miles. Creepy.
Minds turned back to the football
- we were ready to bring Tiki-Taka
(pronounced Punt and Rush) to
Bristol. However the pitch turned
out to be on the side of a hill with
more bobbles than over the road at
Harlington. This wasn’t ideal for the
high-tempo pass and move football
Tim Beasley wanted to impose on the
squad and so IC reverted to Tiki-Taka.
To match the disarray of the pitch
the opposition provided a flat football
(hence the excellent purchase just
hours earlier), and after at least an
hour, some nets. The light was fading
but that was no matter, and the match
began.
It was a very cagey affair with
neither team able to keep possession,
but both defences holding strong.
The game needed a goal badly and
Imperial aren’t ones to disappoint. A
corner was promptly conceded and
no-one picked up a runner from deep
who buried his header into the roof of
the net. University of Bristol Captain’s
Select XI 1 – 0 ICUAFC. Disaster. IC
responded by winning a throw-in deep
in the Bristol half and exploited Miles
Covers’ long throw with the help of
the tall team, Dom Wood scoring with
a looping header over the keeper. Cue
pandemonium in the stands and a
pitch invasion.
Within minutes it was 2-1, Guy
Frankel scoring after some good work
from Julian Iacoponi on the right
sparking a second pitch invasion.
Things were going far too easily for IC.
A mistake from Frosty at the back let
the Bristol Striker get one-on-one with
Sam who was beaten with an elegant
dink which received a well-deserved
round of applause from the travelling
fans. Minutes later and an even worse
mistake from Frosty put Bristol clean
through again to put IC 3-2 down.
Calamity. Julian came to the rescue
once again and levelled the game at
3-3 on the stroke of half time. What a
game. The only thing that could make
it any better would be 8 more goals…
Immortals
barely beat
Bears
The Immortals returned to
Harlington to take on the Royal
Holloway Bears in another tense
game of American football.
Going into the weekend the
Immortals were undefeated, having
only been scored against once by the
KCL Regents. The Bears, who were
also unbeaten, looked as though they
would be the toughest opposition
yet, with playmakers on both
offense and defense. This match was
important to both teams as whoever
won would be placed at the top of
the London Conference.
There was tension in the air as the
match kicked off, both teams knew
what was on the line and both were
clearly up for a fierce game. The
Immortals kick off team chased
down field to make the tackle.
The game was tougher than the
Immortals has expected, the Bears
had talent in all areas of the field and
had clearly greatly improved from
previous years.
It was only minutes into the first
quarter when the Bears got their first
big play; a screen pass gave them a
huge gain, positioning them only
one yard from the goal line. They
then managed to run the ball in for
a touchdown, only the second to
be scored against the Immortals’
defense this season. They converted
their PAT attempt and the score
stood at 7-0.
The Immortals were shaken, never
before this season had they been
behind another team. The offense
took the field, but the Bears defense
proved too much, forcing a punt
from the Immortals. The Bears
offense wasted no time getting back
into their rhythm and drove the ball
deep into the Immortals’ half. A deep
pass from their quarterback scored
their next touchdown, then with
another successful conversion the
score was 14-0, and the Immortals
had been stunned.
The first quarter came to a close,
and as the sides switched ends
there was seemed to be a change in
mentality from the home team. They
opened the second quarter hitting
them hard with big run plays, with
the thought of losing their fuel for
aggression. The Immortals worked
their way deep into the Bears’ half,
and then Duncan Mackinnon ran in
for a touchdown from just yards out.
The coaches opted for an extra point
attempt, which was converted as
Marcus Stead-Hall ran into the end
zone. The gap was then decreased to
14-8.
The Immortals’ defense stepped
up their game and managed to
stop some of the Bears’ key plays,
allowing the home offense to take
the field once more before the half
was over. Again the ball was taken
into the Bears’ half, and then a deep
pass from Toby Sinclair to Tino
Millar was caught in the end zone.
Once more Marcus ran in on the
extra point attempt, setting the score
at 14-16.
The Immortals had the lead going
into halftime, but the players were
well aware that the game was far
from over, the Bears had proved that
they were capable of scoring and had
the ability to stop the Immortals’
offense.
The third quarter was slow, both
sides driving the ball but neither
able to make the final push to score
a touchdown. The next change in
score came in the fourth quarter. The
Bears’ quarterback read the defense
and kept the ball, running in for a
touchdown. They tried to get the
extra point, but were unsuccessful.
The Immortals offense returned
to the field with the score at 20-16.
The Bears stopped the Immortals
advancing down the field and the
home defense had to get on the field
and stop the Bears scoring again. Big
tackles from the Immortals pinned
back the Bears, stopping them from
running down the game clock, and
importantly giving the Immortals’
offense one more chance to score.
They were back on the field with
barely any time to spare. If the
Immortals were going to remain
undefeated, they would have to
score, and fast. The offense drove
down the field, and with time
running out Toby found Tino with
a deep pass, which was caught on
the one-yard line. There were merely
seconds remaining when the players
lined up in their positions, and with
just 3 seconds left when the ball was
snapped, Toby snuck into the end
zone to score a touchdown. The
Immortals’ sideline erupted. They
had come from behind to win the
game 20-22, beating their hardest
opposition of the season so far.
Most valuable player awards were
given to Tino Millar for his great
catches, Toby Sinclair for controlling
the offense, Jordan Douglas and
Joe Downey for their great work on
the offensive line, and to Guillame
Fontan for his big plays from the
defensive line.
The unbeaten record still stands,
and is now set at four games.

IC American Football
Man of the mini-tour Matt Cann gives his account
A disastrous change of goalkeeper
led to an early flurry of goals, by
which point the floodgates had been
well and truly opened. Some more
football was played and the final score
was irrelevant. IC had got the all-
important moral victory and that was
all that mattered. Matt Cann was voted
player of tour, an award all too familiar
for him. We headed back to the hostel
with some dignity intact, ready to be
lost for good later that night.
After already having sampled the
worst club in Bristol, IC thought it
wise to keep low quality in mind and
visited Walkabout, ranked 6, followed
by Syndicate, second in the worst
nights in Bristol (The Tab Bristol,
2013).
Again IC weren’t troubled by
the poor quality of nightlife - we
knew how to make anywhere good.
Channelling Shakers, we headed forth
but were stopped in our tracks, much
like Groves, when a photo booth was
spotted. Several hundred photos and
millions of shapes later the night
looked to be coming to a premature
end. However IC weren’t quite
finished and Kebab U Like It wasn’t
ready for what was about to happen.
YAYA! YAYA YAYA! YAYA YAYA!
YAYA YAYA TOURE! KOLO! KOLO
KOLO! KOLO KOLO! KOLO KOLO
TOURE! 20 minutes later and it was
time to call it a night.
Sunday arrived and IC departed,
making it back in time to catch the last
¾ of Super Sunday with heads full of
memories of a successful domination
of Bristol.
