Snooker and
Pool: The year
so far
It was a term to remember for
the Imperial mints, as membership
rocketed and records tumbled, in
what was a fantastic ending to a
difficult year.
The autumn term began, as it
always does, with the madness of
Freshers’ fair – an event at which Rob
“robbing frames” Hughes excelled
and embarrassed himself in equal
measure. His decision to dress up
as a pool table left him continually
swamped by freshers, with several
begging to borrow the outfit for the
after-party and many more pledging
to join the club. The gimmick, along
with the club’s mini pool table,
manned by president Max “maximum
safety” Chalmers, clearly captured the
imagination of the fair-going public
as membership was up by 50% on the
previous year by the time freshers’
fortnight drew to a close.
The Southern Universities 8-ball
Pool Championships took place in
the third week of term and the club
departed for a sun-soaked Guildford
with a number of new and exciting
talents in tow. They had been selected
from the hugely well attended – and
extremely competitive – team trials
tournament, which saw the club take
over the whole of Rileys sports bar in
Victoria.
The tournament might have been
a complete disaster for our lads after
all of them were knocked out of the
Individual Championship in their
first or second round matches. The
team tournament also got off to an
equally shaky start; with the firsts and
seconds taking one frame between
them (from a possible 18!) in their
first three matches. Things began
to look desperate, before they took
a dramatic turn, with Markus “the
Marksman” Frembs (a newcomer
to the club), President Max and Ben
“hardly ginger” Harvey putting in
some stunning frames to inspire their
respective teams.
From there the first team won all
their remaining group matches to
qualify for the championship, while
the second team put in some excellent
performances despite finishing
bottom of their group and leaving a
day early. While the first team was
subsequently knocked out by a very
strong Kent side, their 7th placed
finish was the club’s best ever result
in a pool tournament and they left
the competition with their heads held
high.
No national university snooker took
place in the first term, but that didn’t
stop the club holding a number of
internal events, with the early rounds
of the Freshers’ tournament taking
place on commemoration day. Players
of all strengths took part in the first-
years only event, with LSE’s Charnon
Boonnuch the first non-Imperialite
to take part in the competition. He
was only defeated in the final which
he lost 4-3 to “the Marksman” who
was making quite a start to his time at
Imperial.
The Internal Snooker League had its
opening group stage from November
until the conclusion of term, with
the competition as fierce as ever. A
number of shock exits were seen, as
this year’s freshers provided a greater
threat than many had anticipated.
Predictably, Bogdan, loser of only 2
internal matches ever, sailed through
while “hardly ginger” Harvey won
an impressive four out of four in
what had looked like a tough group.
The competition now splits into the
Championship and Trophy in the
spring term and there is all to play
for – even for those whose luck didn’t
hold in the first term.
The year came to an exquisite end
in Telford, at the UPC 9-ball Pool
Championships. Compared with
Guildford, the tournament turned
out to be somewhat of a reversal of
fortunes, with the major triumph
coming in the individual event and
the team performance being a little
disappointing. Due to the harsh nature
of 9-ball competition, our three man
team found themselves completely
knocked out after only two losses, a
result which disappointed Alex “magic
cross” Lambrianos almost as much as
the lack of sausage rolls at the event.
Similarly swift eliminations from the
individuals were in store for both Max
and Alex, but not for “the Marksman”
of Deutschland. The affable German
ran nurburgrings around his hapless
opponents all the way to the Semis
where he fell to fellow “auslander”
Bernd Gentoner in a match which
UPC’s Facebook page described as
“arguably the best match we have seen
in the history of the competition”.
In finishing 3rd he became the first
Imperial player ever to medal at an
external pool tournament. What a
player.

Triathlon Club Take
on the BUCS Chilly
Duathlon to End 2013

W
ith the biggest
turn out the
triathlon club
has ever seen,
twenty five
athletes travelling in an entourage
of cars, minibus and one van down
the M4. The term was to culminate
on Sunday 24th at the 2013 BUCS
Duathlon at Castle Combe.
This fast pace race sees competitors
circumnavigate the famous Castle
Combe race track before mounting
bikes and racing five laps of the track
itself. Then to finish you off, a painful
final two mile lap around the outside
of the track on foot brings the pain-
faced athletes to the finish line.
Outstanding performances were
seen from Charlie Houston with a
finish time of 48:06.7 putting him
67th and Sophie Kirk in 56:45.7 for
40th fastest woman of the day, closely
followedbyImoSimmondssixseconds
later to take 42nd. The pressure of the
day got to a few competitors, with
Ed Hallett having a disappointing
day after losing his racking position
in transition and wasting 30 seconds
of hard earned time; Sian Morgan
again lost time in a momentary loss
of awareness by starting the second
run with her shoes on the wrong feet!
Commiserations must be made to
Ellie Howard however after putting in
a strong first run time of 13:39.8 her
helmet strap broke. The marshals tied
the helmet quickly to her head but alas,
too tightly: three laps into the bike leg
and she was losing blood supply to her
head... enough was enough and she
had to back out of the race.
After a quick race and with pain faces
a thing of the past, Weatherspoons
provided the necessary post-race
burger and beer to round off the day
and see everyone home replenished
after the final race of 2013.
Next term sees the start of the
Triathlon session for 2014, and some
big events, including BUCS sprint
and Olympic triathlons, as well as an
Easter tour to Paris and a Summer
tour of England. Bring on 2014!
