FRIDAY 17 JAN
GAMES
Ah, what a powerful feeling!
I manipulate Red Man and Green.
My thumbs are in full control,
I order leaps, dashes and sprints across the screen.
I am the virtual boss,
Haha! I click at buttons A and B,
Every problem you could ever think of, I can solve,
Brave is what I am, staring into the face of adversity.
Princess Peach needs rescuing?
Fear not, I am here!
Relax.
I have the ability, the agility,
Pumped with self-esteem.
Impossibility?
Impossible!
I defy the laws of physics,
Yes, I double jump my way through World Six,
With my artillery; fire flowers,
And my sidekick, Luigi.
Virtual Reality
Here comes my ‘Mario-mobile’,
He’s my dinosaur. You can call him Yoshi.
Everything is under control.
Literally.
Just another day in the office,
Muscles grow very quickly.
No need to strain myself in a weight room,
Body mass times two after eating my favorite Mushroom.
Hardcore gaming. Amazing.
Sadly, back to reality, a light flashes red and yellow.
A handheld system cries for life.
Oh no! Nintendo!
Desperation is signified.
Please, a moment of silence,
The battery of my GameBoy... has just died.

DayZ, nothing about flowers
Shivering in the cold, dressed in
an assortment of scavenged clothes
and gear I wait on top of the hill
overlooking Balota Airfield. Through
the scope of my Mosin, I watch
down below hoping to see something
interesting or somebody to talk to.
I see some movement off to my left,
and excitedly I turn my scope that
way to see if its a fellow survivor. I
sigh, only a zombie and return to my
vigil. Suddenly bullets appear out of
nowhere, hit me in the back and a
black screen appears: You are dead.
This is a usual scenario in DayZ,
the zombie apocalypse MMO, which
has been dominating the Steam sales
for about five weeks, ever since its
early alpha release. The game itself
started out as a mod for ARMA 2,
the hyperrealistic army simulator,
which became immensely popular,
catapulting its maker Dean Hall to
internet fame. Following several
knock-offs which disappointed (e.g.
WarZ), this game has finally been
released. It has now sold more than
a million copies and is the success
that it was aways promised to be.
The games premise is that you wake
up with only a flashlight in the post-
apocalyptic Chernarus, which has
been ravaged by zombies. Looting
the cities, towns and surrounding
military bases for gear, water and food
is your only hope. The only goal of the
game is to survive as long as possible,
because I promise you will die at
some point. Oh I didn’t mention the
fact that once you die, you start over
completely? Yeah, that’s a bummer.
Now why would anyone want to
play such a horrible game, I hear you
think? Because it is just so original
and different from anything out
there. Not only that, but it also does
it really well. Even though DayZ is
still in alpha, with bugs, glitches and
several features missing, this game
still offers more than most full games.
One of the great feature that this
game is its immersion. Without any
HUD indicators (e.g. life, stamina etc.)
you have to rely on the periodic status
updates like “I am hungry/thirsty”
from your character. Furthermore the
fact that your death actually means
something adds tension that very few
games possess. Another feature that
adds to the immersion is the realism
(apart from the zombies of course) of
the game. You need to purify water
before you drink it, you need to make
sure food isn’t rotten before you eat
it and your gear degrades naturally,
in some cases making it completely
unusable. You actually feel like you are
bleeding to death while running from
a crazed zombie while wielding a badly
damaged axe. In fact it gets so tense at
points that I need to take a break to just
calm down. That’s how immersive it is.
Another great aspect of this game is
the multiplayer aspect. The zombies,
while dangerous at the start, become
just a nuisance once you kit up. It is
the other players who are the true
danger. Unpredictable, I tend to find
more people willing to shoot me than
actually team up and help me. In one
instance this has lead me to being
handcuffed, drained of my blood
and then force fed some disinfectant
which led to my death. Yet for all these
idiots’ dickishness, they are what keep
the game new and interesting. In the
future I am actually hoping that I will
find someone genuinely nice, and we
will make the most awesomest team,
and hunt down all those bandits.
On the technical side, the
graphics, new AI and map are quite
impressive. Furthermore the game
seems relatively well optimised so
should run well on most computers.
All in all this game is well worth the
£20 I paid on Steam for it. Furthermore
considering that the price will only be
going up as the game goes through
alpha, beta and then release stages, you
mayaswelljustbuyitnow.Furthermore
if you want someone to play with once
you bought the game, don’t hesitate
to add me on Steam and join the
growing Imperial clan in Chernarus!
My steam name is Megglman. I hope
you guys will join me on my zombie
killing, bandit hunting adventures!
