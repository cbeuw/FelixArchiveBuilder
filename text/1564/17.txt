An epic poem of everyday Gods
Brand New Ancients is a storm of a performance, says Lily Le
K
ate Tempest is a 27 year
old performance poet
from Lewisham, London.
As poetic as her name
may sound, she remains
unheard of to many. But all of this is
changing, fast.
Tempest is the latest winner of the
Ted Hughes Award for innovation in
poetry, with her new piece Brand New
Ancients, a poem-story-play combo
currently touring some of the most
prolific venues in London and the UK.
Standing on the candle-lit stage of
St. Leonard’s Church in Shoreditch,
before a quartet of musicians playing a
score composed by the award-winning
Neil Catchpole, she announces that
this is a piece about “a world beyond
the immediate, beyond trainers and
nice clothes; about the forgotten. It
is about empathy, love, and courage,
which for humans are the most
important, and should be cultivated
in us all.”
Do not be misled, however. As
emotional and tense as it is, Brand
New Ancients is not a soppy affair.
Even prior to the meanings of her
words being fully realised, before
her poetic majesty is registered and
causes a pause for thought, Tempest’s
presence is truly a storm, which eyes
or thoughts cannot wander from.
She describes it herself as an epic
narrative poem – a story that brings
back the mythology of old tales in the
form of the everyday people that get
up and go to work. Indeed, her chorus
repeatedly chimes of them as “The
Gods” doing this or that in various
guises.
Her story of two families with young
children that fall apart, get together,
find themselves and each other in a
modern setting is not an unfamiliar
one. The unique aspect is the
celebration of the everyday, though
an extreme version for those who may
not be acquainted with the infamous
violence of her hometown, which no
doubt grounds the basis of her work.
The way in which the story unwinds
is also evidently influenced by her
play-writing. As she narrates, clear
images of the events are formed in
the mind with a backdrop of dramatic
music, as visual as though watching a
film.
Despite all this, the wittiest part
was her silence, as the violin played
as a manifestation of two young lovers
kissing for the first time. Sweet. “I
take great inspiration from something
that makes me feel,” she explains. “If
something speaks to you through the
ages then that’s the most important
thing in bringing us closer to each
other and ourselves.” This also true of
her own work; as was demonstrated
by the standing ovation she received
at the end of her performance.
Although nothing would come close
to experiencing Kate Tempest other
than watching her speak her poems
before you, Brand New Ancients is
available in book form for those who
take enjoyment in perusing beautifully
laid-out phrases for more than a
fleeting moment.
Kate Tempest: Brand New Ancients
is touring now until 20th April. See

All-male Swan Lake makes ballet history
Clara Clark Nevola
Writer
What: Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake
Where: Sadler’s Wells, EC1
When: Until 26th January
Price: Various
D
ance newbies: this is not
frilly dresses and satin
shoes. You will be exposed
to raw power, unsettling
emotions and unsettling
scenes. Ballet aficionados: prepare to
be amazed at the side of Swan Lake
this performance brings out.
Set to Tchaikovsky’s music for Swan
Lake, one of the most loved and most
performed classical ballets, Matthew
Bourne’s production created great
controversy. And yet, 18 years from
premiere, every tour sells out – a
testament to its truly unique impact.
The performance revolutionises Swan
Lake as a performance, while sticking
faithfully to the musical score.
At the centre of the dance, replacing
the traditional figure of Odette, the
fragile princess turned swan, is the
Prince and the Swan. The former
(Simon Williams) is timid, insecure
and alone, the latter a powerful, vital,
extraordinary creature, filled with
mystery, masculinity and strength.
Jonathan Ollivier brings an almost
frightening power to this role,
commanding the hearts and emotions
of the Prince and the audience in a
way rarely seen on stage.
Scorned by his frigid, fashionable
mother, the Prince drifts through his
royal duties, distracted and sorrowful.
Escaping the strict, sterile geometry
of his castle, he discovers passion,
sexuality and life in a grimy bar
downtown. This is when his life starts
intertwining with the swans, creating
scenes with an almost hallucinatory
atmosphere, between reality and
visions. Masculine, powerful, violent,
hauntingly beautiful and utterly non-
human, the swans appear repeatedly
to the Prince. First hostile, then almost
within reach, with the lead Swan by
turns beckoning and aggressive.
This interpretation is inspired: the
side of a swan we all know exists. Yes,
swans are graceful and pretty, like the
iconic female tutu-clad swans of Swan
Lake. But they are also powerful,
wild, ruthless and unreachable, as
are Matthew Bourne’s half naked,
muscular men with shaved heads –
alluring and terrifying.
The performance continues in an
increasingly frenzied setting, as the
Prince’s obsession with the Swan
grows. Ollivier takes the role of the
Stranger, the Black Swan/Odile of
traditional Swan Lakes, and appears
in sexy black leather at a palace ball.
Tantalising the Prince by scorning
his affections in public, the Stanger
dances provocatively with all the
women at the ball. And yet the
emotional tension between him and
the Prince is palpable – can this lady’s
man really be the same wild and heart-
breaking creature of the Prince’s night
time encounters?
The genius of this production does
not lie in reimagining a well-known
romantic ballet as a modern, male
couple dance, though the homoerotic
tensionhasgotmanytongueswagging.
Nor does it lie in choreographing a
jazz routine to Tchaikovsky soaring
score, though this is an impressive
achievement.
The reason for which this
performance is, and will remain, a key
production in the dance repertoire is
that it shows us what a classical ballet
is for. Not for tutus, not for repertoire
steps and revered, un-modifiable
canons. Ballet is not even for pointe
shoes or scenes of pretty heroines
against ungainly baddies. A real dance
production will stir dark, buried
emotions inside you. It will make you
long for those wild and unharnessed
feelings described by the music and
incarnated in the dance.
There has not been a new
performance of this kind since early
twentieth century Paris, and Matthew
Bourne, a fifty year old east Londoner,
has created something worthy of
balletic history.
