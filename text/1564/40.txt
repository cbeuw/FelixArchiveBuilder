Success for
Imperial College
Equestrian Teams!
O
n the 11th December 2013
both of Imperial’s Equestrian
teams had their second
competitions of the year. The first
team was hosting their competition
at Trent Park Equestrian Centre
and the second team were visiting
Southampton.
Despite a few mishaps in the
morning before the competition, the
first team was ready for the start of
the competition on time. The team
warmed up the dressage horses for the
other teams to see. Franklyn, Hope,
Lucy and Samba were all impeccably
behaved and so the first riders on
each horse began their allotted warm-
up time. Andre Wilmes, a returning
team member who had unfortunately
sprained his ankle two days before the
competition but was determined to
ride, rode Samba beautifully and they
achieved the best score of the whole
day. Team Captain, Rachel Gregory,
riding Lucy and Natasha Woods-
Kreisler riding Hope also managed to
ride the best dressage tests on their
horses. Our fourth team member,
Leila Royle-Davies rode a beautiful
test on her horse Franklyn, but was
unfortunate to only be placed second
on her horse. Once the dressage tests
were complete the jumping course
was put up, whilst the scores were
counted. We were in the lead after the
dressage, on a score of 19 penalties,
with our closest rivals Royal Holloway
on 62 penalties. The jumping course
was as big as the rules allow, and again
the team warmed up the jumping
horses before Rachel was the first to
compete on Maximus, Andre was
second on Brazil, Natasha was third
on Avignon and Leila was the last to
ride Teak. Andre was judged to have
ridden the best on Brazil on so he won
overall. Rachel came second on her
jumping horse and was placed third
overall. Natasha scored 9 penalties on
her horse and was placed sixth, and
Leila scored 22 penalties. The team
results were announced as well, and
with all four riders’ scores counting,
we had won on 55 penalties. The
University of Kent was second on
108 penalties, Royal Holloway was
third on 110 penalties and LSE were
fourth on 302 penalties. After this
competition, Imperial is leading the
mini-league, with Rachel individually
second and Andre third.
The second team’s competition at
Southampton was run under exactly
the same format, with the dressage
tests in the morning and jumping in
the afternoon. In the dressage Sara
Wieclawska was the first to ride her
horse, Becky Salen was second to
ride her horse, Sorin Popa third and
Lucie Walder fourth. All the dressage
tests were ridden extremely well,
and the team was in third place after
dressage. In the show-jumping Becky
rode a fantastic clear round, Sara was
unlucky to have one fence down and
both Lucie and Sorin unfortunately
had two refusals. Overally, Becky
was placed 7th, Lucie was placed
8th and the team was placed third
overall, an improvement on their first
competition.
If you would like to try horse-riding,
we are holding a Give It A Go session
for beginner riders on 29th January.

IC RIDING AND POLO
The first fencing premiership
BUCS tournament was held in
Oxford in December, where the
home crew, as well as Cambridge,
UCL, Bristol and the mighty
Imperial crossed swords once
again.
For two days, the teams
competed to take lead in the
race for the coveted league title.
Saturday started with an early 9am
match against Bristol. Winning the
weapon’s order toss, we decided
to start with our foilists who were
so pumped they had begun their
warm-up the night before.
Despite a tricky opposition, the
team pulled off a promising 45-
42 win. Sabre was up next, and
we decided to sharpen the game.
A ruthless and almost perfect
performance by Chris “8pak”
Lawrence lead to a 45-15 sweep,
and left no time for the opposition
to realise that their match was
getting out of hand. This inspired
the epee to finish off the match,
scoring 41 points and giving
the newly named “Pimperials” a
comfortable win, 131-102.
Next on the list was the talented
Cambridge team, an old rival that
has been known to give Imperial
fencers a hard time… Foilists were
put up first and trailed by a few
hits against a strong side. However
as the match progressed, Imperial
fencer “Super-Soren” Pfitzner got
increasingly angry, leaving no
chances for a terrified Cambridge
team. A beautiful finish by Glen
“The Beast” Ostacchini turned the
tables round and ended the match
in a 44-42 win. Sabre was up next
and felt the pressure to perform
after the textbook foils win.
However, the sabreurs were too
proud to be outdone by another
weapon and slashed their way
through the opposite side to fetch
a brutal 45-18 win. This provided a
precious lead against Cambridge’s
tricky Epee team. The epeeists did
nottakethisasasigntorestthough,
and battled to the finish getting an
impressive 35 hits. This totalled to
a 124-105 for Pimperials, showing
the opposition who was really
dominating the tournament.
After a long tiring day of winning,
the Imperial fencers gathered
their forces to fight the Blues for
Saturday’s last match. To the keen
Imperial foilists’ disappointment,
the weapon’s order toss was lost so
the sabreurs reluctantly warmed
up to start the match. Just kidding,
they absolutely could not wait to
kick some butt. The trio sharpened
their swords and slew the Oxford
sabreurs 45-15 with a star indicator
by Didier “Old-School” Nohlmans.
As Oxford’s strengths lying in Foil
andEpee,thenextmatchpromisedto
be challenging. However Pimperial
foilists kept it together, and with
some swift attacks from Clyde “The
Beard” Fare, reached a safe 36 hits
against their on-form adversaries.
The tension was at its peak as Epee
started the last leg, needing 25 hits
to win against the Blues. A difficult
start showed that it was not going to
be an easy finish. Wanna-be epeeists
Camille Van Hoffelen and “M-Iron
Man” Ratneswaran used their sabre
speed to confuse the opponents,
pushing the Oxford team’s pride a
little further into the ground with
Maiyuran’s toe shattering foot flick.
In the second half of the match
however, Oxford changed tactics
and played time. They were trying
to avoid being hit, betting that their
anchor would be able to catch it
all up against our second-finisher.
Little did they know that Jonathan
“Ice-Croft” Ashcroft was the coolest
man alive, and slowly took apart
the top Oxford epeeist’s game in a
thrilling penultimate bout. This gave
the leverage for Harry “The Flick”
Gulliver to finish off the match 45-
25, winning overall by one point. Or,
as we like to call it, “one-ing” against
the Blues.
After a well-deserved lie-in on
Sunday, Pimperials got ready for the
last match of the tournament against
an impressive, newly promoted UCL
team. Sabre was set to start. The on-
form UCL side fenced really well, but
the sabre trio kept focus and won a
comfortable 45-25. Epee was granted
the arrival of resident star Jamie “The
Hulk”SimpsondirectfromBratislava
U20 World Cup. His intimidating
shouts and signature Green Mask
spurred the team forwards. Harry
“The Flick” Gulliver proceeded to
destroy the opposition with his
flawless technique in a 12 hit run,
leading to a huge 38 points against
an international standard UCL side.
This left foil with a tense finishing
task. A combative UCL side grinded
away hits and kept up the suspense
down to the last few seconds.
Despite the building tension, a solid
performance from “Super-Soren”
and “Is it a sabreur, is it a foilist, is
it an epeeist, no, it’s M-Iron Man”
carried the Imperial team 2 points
from the win in the penultimate
bout. This paved the way for Glen
“The Beast” Ostacchini to shine at
the tensest of moments and take the
win by scoring 4 consecutive parries
over the UCL finisher. Pimperial
won the last match of the weekend
118-114, coming back home with
a clean sheet and hunger for many
more.

Last weekend saw Ethos sports
centre nearly full to capacity as over
one hundred and sixty competitors
descended on Imperial College to
take part in the Imperial College
Open.
Now in its second year, the
Imperial College Open has become
a major event in the competitive
year for many university clubs, with
students from as far as Newcastle
and Sheffield flocking to South
Kensington to participate. Over
130 fights, across 35 different
weight and class categories took
place throughout the day, posing a
significant challenge for the largely
student-run competition.
Despite these hurdles, Imperial
College Tae Kwon Do club
(ICUTKD) dominated proceedings,
taking home a staggering 21 medals
(9 bronze, 6 silver and 6 gold) from
a pool of 25 competitors, across all
weight and skill categories. This
was the highest number of medals
of any university club, and enough
to ensure the newly inaugurated
‘Imperial Award’ remains firmly in
the hands of Imperial College in its
first year.
We would like to take this
opportunity to thank all of the
people who volunteered on the
day, helping to ensure the smooth
running and ultimate success of the
Imperial College Open. Thank you
to the British Student Tae Kwon Do
Federation (BSTF), the Red Cross,
Sport Imperial and the Ethos staff,
who were all instrumental in the
organisation of the event. We would
also like to thank our instructor,
Master Reza Saberi and our coaches
for their guidance and support over
the last few months.
With the Imperial College Open
2013 being a huge success and a
milestone in terms of our sporting
achievement, we realise that there is
still much work to be done this year.
We hope that with this experience
under out Tae Kwon Do belts, we
can go forward to achieve bigger
and better things at the Student
Nationals and the Imperial College
Open 2014. Watch this space!
