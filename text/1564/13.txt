FRIDAY 06 DEC
COMMENT
H
ello all! Welcome back to
a new term! Hopefully
you’ve recharged over
the Christmas break and
are all ready to sit your
exams, do your coursework, or laugh
at the poor souls who do so while you
get away scott free!
At Felix, over the Christmas break
we’ve been working behind the scenes
to bring you some improvements and
are happy to announce the release
of our new app and some updates to
our website. Have a look around and
see if you can notice what’s changed
(although a lot of it isn’t design
related).
For those of you who are
experiencing the stress train, fear not,
the Union is hosting the originally
named “Stress Less” fortnight! Head
over to the Wellbeing section (pages
8-9) to find out more. Stress is never
a plesant issue and many students
can sucumb to pressure during exam
periods, especially in this terrible
weather. If you do end up having any
problems always remember that you
can consult your personal tutor, the
College counselling service or the
helpful staff at the Union, all of whom
will be happy to assist you.
There’s some exciting news this
week, our hard working Sabbs
apparently do more than spend all day
dancing on a screen. Thanks to lots
of work by out Sabbs and Professor
Lord Robert Winston, the issues
surrounding the potential problems
faceb by international students in the
face of the looming Immigration Bill
will be explored in an inquiry by the
House of Lords Select Committee on
Science and Technology. Talk about
results!
Also this week we bring you news
of College’s residential experience
survey. It’s great to head that College
has perked up a bit and has started to
take more of an interest in the impacts
it operations and decisions have on its
student stakeholders, especially after
last term’s debacle with the handing
of communications concerning the
cleaning provision in halls and the
accomodation license.
The panel will discuss a wide-
ranging number of topics to do with
the Imperial College Residential
Experience, presenting the results
to the Provost’s board at the end
of March. However there are some
concerns regarding the length of the
consultation. While we understand
that it is necessary in order to
bring needed change to the College
Accomodation experience, we believe
that decisions that have the potential
to cause major upheaval to the
accomodation system (and student
welfare), should be taken over a longer
period of time, with more stringent
student, warden and welfare feedback.
Regardless, we welcome the fact
that College is staking some action
to improve the student experience
in ways that aren’t only focused on
academia.
The remit of the review is wide
ranging and is expected to also touch
on provisions for students in private
accomodation. If you feel that you
would like to provide feeback (and are
not furiously revising, go to http://

There’s an east
wind coming...
