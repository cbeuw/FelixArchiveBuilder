2012 - The Costa Concordia crashed off the
shore of Tuscany, proving there is someone
less qualified to be a captain than Captain
Birdseye.

continuing the Kim legacy in North Korea. I’m
not touching this one with a bargepole, so I’ll
leave it to Dennis Rodman.
1967 - Ronald Reagan was sworn into his first
political office, proving that politics and acting
have been essentially the same for a long time.
1955 - The first nuclear powered submarine,
USS Nautilus, was launched, giving the Liberal
Democrats something to complain about for
the rest of their existence.

forever giving your distant relatives something
they can give you for Christmas.
1863 - Tube trains started running between
Paddington and Farringdon Street, the oldest

Gout Not Funny Now That People Have It
M
ore and more
people in Britain are
getting gout, a study
by the Institute of
Hilarious Diseases
reveals. Gout is a form of arthritis
caused by a build up of uric acid in the
blood, this forms an amusing swelling
on the big toe.
‘“The big toe, or the first piggy, has
traditionally been regarded as the
funniest toe” claims health expert Jack
McMac, “It used to be that we’d get

ernie Ecclestone, famed
for his talent in owning
Formula 1 racing, will
soon be facing trial in
Munich for allegedly
bribing a German banker.
Acting for his defence, lawyer Klaus
Vendetta argues that almost all of
Germany’s economic growth is caused
by Ecclestone:
‘Formula 1 needs lots of people to
keep it running. People are required
to package money into suitcases,
others are required to deliver it, it’s an
expensive business.’
A spokesperson for the German
Treasury, or CashHaus as it’s known
locally, claimed that the billionaire
created a trickle-down effect that
made everyone richer.
‘Plus, it didn’t hurt that he was
throwing around huge wads of cash.
I used mine to buy a boat, and that
means I need someone to clean the
boat and someone to steer it. So that’s
two jobs created right there.’
gout and we’d all pop off for a laugh
while he waited for tests. But now that
lots of people have it, it’s much less
funny.”
Many doctors claim that the best
way to treat gout is to lose weight
and exercise, but Pretend Health
Minister Gordon Bennett admits that
this is unlikely to have any real effect:
“We’ve been trying to get people to
live healthier lives for many years now,
but now that gout is no longer funny,
people no longer get the push they
need.
I had one patient with gout whose
friends laughed him out of the pub.
This caused him to drink less, and

anuary exams – the reason
your Christmas was shit, but
don’t worry, the Hangman
editor will provide his top
tips to help you get through
them.
Firstly,makesuretonotreadthrough
your notes until the day before. You
forgot all that crap once already, why
forget it twice? Research has shown
that this is the optimal time to learn
everything. If research includes a
medathanol fuelled cramming session
before my final examinations. I passed,
but my friend trying it with me was
admitted to hospital crying about the
numbers. Still a 50% success rate is
enough to pass your exams.
Next up, don’t bring any pens or
pencils with you to the exam. It shows
you’ve been worrying too much over
it, and the invigilators will smell the
fear. Turn up like a boss and demand
they provide you with some, they’ll
respect you more and give you a
passing grade.
Remember water. That’s the advice
you’re normally given, but what good
is that? Bring vodka with you. You’ll
get more confident throughout the
exam, and when you’re confident
you’ll perform much better. Why
worry about your answers when you
can get kicked out the exam hall for
trying to drunk call your ex?
So best of luck for any exams you
have, and if you do follow any of this
advice you probably don’t deserve to
stay here.
F
ollowing unconfirmed
rumours of private boat
parties and champagne
breakfasts after managing
a quorate council the
Union has taken the decision to
limit the potential bonuses it’s
sabbatical officers can be awarded to
a paltry 2000% of their pre-tax salary.
Bonuses have historically been given
out for outstanding achievements
such as turning up to work on time,
attending meetings and not losing
£200,000.
An anonymous Union source
spoke to Hangman, “While these
bonuses might seem large to the
average student, you have to consider
what the sabbatical officers put up
with. Next thing you’ll be asking us to
check up on their election promises
or something.”
Of course not everyone is in favour
of the large bonuses; an Imperial
graduate at RBS is launching a
campaign against the move. “In my
job we’re only allowed a bonus up
to double our salary, and even then
Labour are trying to reduce it. I
didn’t spend my final year filling in
those stupid online tests for this.”
