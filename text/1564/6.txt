O
n 14th April 2013
the British Union
for the Abolition of
Vivisection (BUAV)
presented Imperial
College London with a report
that accumulated a list of various
allegations of misconduct concerning
animal experimentation. The report
contained a video produced by the
undercover investigator, which
BUAV released to the public, which
purported to demonstrate a number
of instances of poor animal welfare
practices. As a result Imperial College
came under national scrutiny, which
can be seen on the comments on
College’s social media pages. The
public outcry, included Morrissey and
Brian May, called for an immediate
independent inquiry.
The BUAV believed the report
provided evidence for a violation of
the Animal (Scientific Procedures)
Act 1986 (as amended to incorporate
the changes brought in the by the
European Directive, 2010/63/EU).
The act insists that institutions acquire
a personal license, provided by the
Home Office, in order to practise
animal research. The license sets
out the limitation of each research
project according to its categorised
severity. The report is thought to have
highlighted a number of instances of
poor animal handling that includes:
exceeding severity limits; poor
monitoring and staff cover; poor
surgical practice and anaesthesia;
administration of analgesics;
approaches to the killing of animals.
In response, the Home Office began
an enquiry in the allegations. Imperial
College announced “immediate
actions” and invited Professor Steve
Brown, Medical Research Council’s
Mammalian Genetics Unit, and
Harwell to chair an independent
committee to investigate and assess
the approach to animal care and
welfare across the College. Though
the college insisted the committee was
independent, the Chief Executive of
the BUAV Michelle Thew accused this
investigation as a “white-wash.” The
organisation claimed that Professor
Steve Brown was “a well-known and
strong supporter of animal research,
heading the Medical Research Council
(MRC) unit which manipulates mice
to predispose them to develop all
manner of diseases, but the MRC
actually funds animal research at the
Imperial College.” The organisation
and their supporters (including
Brian May) petitioned for a different,
independent inquiry.
The committee convened 6 June,
2013 and set out to provide a report
that described College’s best practises
regarding animal research, including
those that had room for enhancement;
delivered detailed recommendations
for improvement, and attempted to
provide potential solutions, where
possible. The committee was clear that
it would not investigate the specific
allegations made by BUAV. The role
of the committee was to examine all
aspects of animal experimentation at
the College facilities including areas
such as ethical review, operations,
compliance,trainingandmanagement.
The committee took a mixture of
approaches which included interviews
of Imperial personnel, the examination
of relevant documents requested and
a visit to the animal facility described
in the BUAV allegations. The
committee found that husbandry and
maintenance of facilities was carried
out to a high standard. Moreover, the
animal house staffs were supportive,
committed, engaged, and willing to
do more in terms of developing new
approaches to animal welfare.
The committee however concluded
that Imperial’s Animal Welfare and
Ethical Review Body (AWERB) was
not fit for purpose due to a lack
focus on the 3Rs of animal research
(the replacement, reduction and
refinement of animals in research)
and lack of involvement of scientists.
The committee recommended a more
rigorous process that takes these
shortcomings into consideration.
AWERB are required by all research
institutions in the UK. The body
has a wide set of responsibilities
including: ensuring animal welfare,
reviewing the use of animals in
experimentation, and discussing the
3Rs. The implementation of these
recommendations will be critical for
Imperial to reach the standards in the
3Rs.
It was found that the local AWERB
process, which was conducted
electronically, failed to provide a
forum for discussions and to deliver
improvements in the 3Rs. The local
AWERB also failed to engage scientists
on a broad basis across Imperial, and
thus there was very little opportunity
to discuss and take a substantive and
active role in reviewing approaches
to animal experimentation. The
committee recommend that the
local AWERB process be reformed
with the creation of two standing

I actually do.’
committees, one at South Kensington/
St. Mary’s, the other at Hammersmith.
This reformed committee should
be compromised of key staff from
animal facilities along with scientists,
and should meet regularly to review
project applications with the scientists
concerned.
The committee also recommended
reforms for the central AWERB
process, establishing a new role for
this forum. The central AWERB
should receive reports from the local
AWERB and discuss strategic and
operational issues on animal welfare.
The central forum is to be chaired
by a senior faculty member such as a
Dean. Both local and central AWERB
meetings should be wider advertised
and anonymised minutes should be
made available.
The committee recommended
an increase in staffing levels and a
reduction on the reliance on agency
staff. They also recommended
staff monitor research labs at least
once daily, which will contribute to
competency reports of license holders.
The BUAV video raised questions
on the training of researchers
experimenting on animal research and
whether the College’s animal welfare
officers were performing their jobs
effectively. The committee’s training
and competency assessment found
that the training was “ad hoc” and the
mechanisms for sharing information
currently in place were not effective.
The committee recommended a
“significant increase” for the resources
allocated to training and competency
assessment and suggested that this be
accompanied with the appointment
of a senior Named Training and
Competency Officer (NTCO).
The report studied the culture,
leadership and management of animal
research at Imperial, recommending
an annual College prize to the team
that make outstanding commitment
or contribution in the development
of the 3Rs. In addition, the committee
recommended the creation of a new
senior directorial role that will take
overall responsibility for the delivery
of bio-services at Imperial.
Imperial College responded by
promising “to move quickly to
implement the recommendations”
and stated that there is “a significant
scope for improvement in aspects
of the operation, management and
oversight in order to become a world
leader in animal research.”
A separate inquiry, undertaken by
the Home Office, is expected to be
published soon.
