Funding for poorest
students threatened
Government refuses to rule out
cuts to the Student Opportunity
Allocation fund

A
n influential higher
education think-
tank has accused
the government
of betraying its
commitment to social mobility
by planning to cut funds given
to universities as an incentive to
attract students from financially
disadvantaged backgrounds.
Million+, a group of 22 British
universities, claims that recent
spending reviews indicate that the
government plans to reduce the
Student Opportunity Allocation
fund, which is paid to universities
in proportion to how many students
from poorer households that they
accept, by almost £200 million –
slashing the fund by more than
half. The fund – together with
other schemes such as the National
Scholarship Programme, which has
also faced recent cuts – is used by
universities to run both outreach
events and schemes to help those
students who are most at risk of
dropping out of university.
Giving evidence to the Business,
Innovation and Skills Committee
this Tuesday, David Willetts,
Minister of State for Universities
and Science, stressed that while “it’s
very important that we spend on
access” he could not rule out any
cuts. This is despite a recent joint
report by million+ and the National
Education Opportunities Network
(NEON), concluding that: “Student
Opportunity funding serves as an
investment in the nation’s talent
and future workforce, arguably the
most important part of the country’s
infrastructure, and that cutting the
Student Opportunity allocation
would, therefore, be an entirely false
economy”.
Rumours of the cuts have lead to
widespread criticism. In a statement,
Dr Graeme Atherton, Director of
NEON, said: “Student Opportunity
funding is an efficient source of
finance that follows the student in an
ecosystem that gets results, improves
the UK’s economic competitiveness
and offers a long term return on
investment to the Treasury. Any
move to reduce or replace Student
Opportunity funding would result
in a less effective system and leave
both individuals and taxpayers
worse off over the long term.” Pam
Tatlow, Chief Executive of Million+,
added: “To lose this funding would
be a real disaster, especially since the
withdrawal of £100 million from the
National Scholarship Programme
a year early. It appears that the
universities who are doing most of
the heavy lifting in social mobility
are the ones paying the price for the
expansion of student numbers.”
This was a view shared by Professor
Michael Gunn, Chair of Million+
and Vice Chancellor of Staffordshire
University, who added: “Any move to
reduce this successful area of funding
would cast doubt on the sincerity of
politicians who, while supporting
social mobility in speeches, would in
practice be cutting funds that make a
difference.”
In a letter to the Business Secretary,
Vince Cable – whose department
is responsible for higher education
– the National Union of Students
expressed “strong opposition to any
such cut in public funding”. The letter
says that: “in the wake of cuts to the
National Scholarship Programme any
such cut to the Student Opportunity
fund would be read as a backtracking
of the government’s commitments to
supporting social mobility in favour
of backfilling the budgetary hole
caused by a blank cheque written
to private providers”. It goes on
to ask for official “assurance that
[the Government] will think again
before decimating the capability of
the sector to support students from
poorer backgrounds.”
The final funding allocation will
be announced later this month in
Cable’s annual grant letter to the
Higher Education Funding Council
for England.
A report by Million+ and NEON
has criticised plans to cut the Stu-
dent Opportunity Allocation fund
A
fter a low turnout at
Tuesday’s Council
meeting, the session was
abandoned since they
lacked the quorum level of attendance
required for binding votes.
While the missing students may
have been excused by the pull of
examinations or projects, the Council
body missed the chance to pass several
papers, including the Safe Space
Policy – a policy aiming to create an
environment in Union venues that
all members, staff and visitors can
feel safe in, a paper discussing the
support provided by the Union for
halls of residence located further from
South Kensington, and a paper about
changing the name of the Union’s
Deputy President (Finance & Services,
DPFS) role, prompted by changes to
the Sabbatical Officer roles last year.
The current DPFS, Kieron Creagh
submitted a paper to Tuesday’s
Council session about the topic
in which he seemingly dismissed
the recommendations of last year’s
Council and Sabbs and proposed that
this year’s Sabbatical Officers carry
out a(nother) review of the sabbatical
roles with a look to make their own
recommendations for next year’s
sabbatical team.
As well as not providing a thorough
and balanced discussion about the
role’s name change in the proposed
paper, or providing much reference
to any of the data collected by last
years Sabbs, the DPFS also submitted
the paper 4 working days after the
deadline, just one day before the
Council session.
While the paper was not discussed
in Council, due to the committee
being three members short of quorum,
giving the fact that the next Council
session takes place on 11th February
there will not be enough time to
discuss the paper before the election
cycle begins, effectively achieving the
aims of the paper.
The idea to change the name of
the DPFS stemmed from a paper
discussed at Union Council last year,
in which the Sabbatical Officers’
remits were expanded. At the time
the previous DPFS stated that he
believed the role was able to expand
into it’s additional responsibilities,
which included student development,
accreditation and the postgraduate
experience, however, it was felt that
this might need to be accompanied
by a change in the name of the role to
include the wider remit.
While several names for the
DPFS were suggested, including DP
Community & Development and
DP Services and Development, DP
Finance, Services and Develpoment.
There were several reservations
with changing the name of the role,
including: discouraging candidates to
apply, misrepresenting the position
to potential future employers and
changing the title of somebody who
had already been elected into the
position. The decision was instead
deferred to the January Council
session this year, before the Big
Elections nominations.
In response to the article, the DPFS
said: “...Pending the role review now
included in our wider Democracy
Review, I’m confident this role next
year will be accurately described as
‘Finance & Services’...”
Council cancelled - will the
DPFS role be renamed?
Cops Off Campus – The Saga Continues
Students vow to “keep the momentum
going” as the Cops off Campus
campaign call another demonstration
on 22 January. Three years on from
the increase in tuition fees and
the student protests that followed,
university campuses are faced with
fresh opposition as the recent protests
against police presence on campus
culminated in thousands of students
marching through Bloomsbury.
Cops off Campus demonstrations
which began after the breakup of
the Senate House occupations, at
UCL on December 4 2013, where
students demanded pensions for
outsourced cleaning staff and to
save the University of London Union
from being abolished. Chris Cobb,
the university’s Chief Operating
Officer, said the occupation: “was a
disgraceful and aggressive act, which
placed the safety of [our] staff at risk”.
The University of London has taken
out an injunction preventing “violent
and intimidating” protests on its
campuses.
University of London Union
(ULU) immediately condemned
the Police and security staffs for the
eviction, claiming many students
were assaulted. Two particularly
controversial videos shows a police
officer punching a protester in the
face and a woman slammed onto
the pavement, the videos ended
up featuring across national media
including The Guardian, and The
BBC. The Met Police said they had
not received any complaints about the
actions of officers at the protests.
ULU sabbatical officers released a
statement stating: “Anyone who thinks
that what happened tonight was
reasonable is not fit to run a university.”
The next 48 hours saw further protests
at Bloomsbury, which resulted in 40
students arrested including a student
from Imperial College London.
On December 10, Imperial Student
Union Council passed the motion
“Criminalisation of Student Protest”
with an addendum which condemnes:
“violent policing”, “disabling bail
conditions” and a declared of their
“refusal to be intimidated by these
recent events”. Although, the request
to provide £100 of travel expenses to
students to attend campaign meetings
was rejected.
Deputy President (Finance &
Services) Kieron Creagh questioned
the relevance of this campaign to
Imperial students, as he believes
the majority of Imperial students
are politically apathetic. The Senate
House occupation demand to keep
ULU open may not relate to many
students on campus since Imperial
College withdrew from University of
London on 8 July 2007.
However, a non-voting member
argued: “If the situation were reversed
and we were being shut down I would
hope that we would have students
up and down the country come and
support us”
The proposer, Andrew Tranter,
said to Felix: “In the past few months
we’ve seen police throwing punches
at peaceful protestors, arresting
journalists and using bail conditions to
stop students from studying. Imperial
students are affected by this because
everyone is affected – what we’re
witnessing is nothing short of a violent
suppression of our fundamental right
to protest.”
December 11 was the Cops off
Campus national day of action that
had 4000 students in attendance,
according to Channel 4. The protest
had minimal police presence, with
most keeping a safe distance. While
the demonstration was mostly
peaceful, one bin was set on fire
and a small group of demonstrators
attempted to break the injunction and
enter Senate House.
Students marched through the Royal
Courts of Justice, where they held
a rally in support for Mark Duggan
during the inquest. The protest came
to an end outside ULU at 6pm, with
no arrests. With mass meetings and
protests planned in the New Year,
student protestors want to “take the
fight to University management.”
