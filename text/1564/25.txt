FRIDAY 17 JAN
FILM
Director masterclass: David Lynch
Peter Brook
Writer
Lynch is the master of creating unset-
tling dreamlike visions and the surreal.
He has written and directed cult clas-
sics such as Eraserhead (1977), Blue
Velvet (1986) and Mulholland Drive
(2001). He also directed the more
mainstream Elephant Man (1980).
Though the he has been making films
for 37 years there has been a set of
aesthetics and themes throughout his
work which bind them together to
create a consistent body of work. Crit-
ics Le Blanc and Odell stated that “his
films are so packed with motifs, recur-
rent characters, images, compositions
and techniques that you could view
his entire output as one large jigsaw
puzzle of ideas.”
The main thing that most people
will quickly recognise is the dreamlike
nature of his films. The director Berg-
man has been described as someone
who would “refashion the stuff of his
unconscious” and due to the oneiric
quality of his work, Lynch might work
in a similar way. Of his work, Lynch
says:
“Waking dreams are the ones that
are important, the ones that come
when I’m quietly sitting in a chair, let-
ting my mind wander. When you sleep,
you don’t control your dream. I like to
dive into a dream world that I’ve made
or discovered; a world I choose... right
there is the power of cinema.”
Another recurring motif in his films
is that of two co-habitanting yet con-
trasting worlds. Often one of happy,
1950ies Rockwellian values, Ameri-
can, clean cut, and wholesome good-
ness with a flip side of a dark, grimy,
industrial underworld, neither of
which alone is real. In Mulholland
Drive Betty Elms is hunting the ‘Hol-
lywood Dream’ in a swell apartment,
Diane Selwyn lives in a grotty cabin-
like dwelling: dirty and drab. Blue Vel-
vet starts with this Rockwellian wet
dream of American life and the scene
morphs to show creepy unsettling
world that lies under this thin façade.
Again we can see something similar
in The Elephant Man with the Circus
underworld and the life of a wealthy
Doctor.
There many other repeated motifs,
things like the machine like nature of
the world, or showing the world as a
stage and split characters. There is a
lot going on, and many of the films
warrant second watches; but, if you
are unfamiliar with Lynch, I suggest
you sit down and let these films wash
over you and I think you’ll find that –
dispite all the strangeness – they are
very engaging and captivating.
His first movie Eraserhead (1977)
was meant to be a short 21-minute art
film for the American Film Institute
but ended up as a 90-minute feature
that became a classic midnight movie.
With its droning industrial soundtrack
and weird imagery, it shows a man liv-
ing in a sparse derelict city. He goes
to visit his girlfriend at her parent’s
house where his mother tells him that
she has given birth to their child. His
girlfriend protests saying that it’s not a
child. The plot then sort of takes a hike
and works it’s way deeper and deeper
into a warren of oddities and ideas.
After seeing Eraserhead (Lynch’s
first movie) it would be easy to be-
lieve that he is an oddball filmmaker
with a cult following. The Elephant
Man (1980) shows that whilst main-
taining all of the oddness and horror
from Eraserhead, Lynch can make a
more accessible film. It is the beautiful
tragedy of one John Merrick (The El-
ephant Man) a deformed man travel-
ling with a freak show who is taken in
from his cruel showmaster and treated
like a human for the first time. How-
ever, because of how strange looking
he is, it is difficult to get away from be-
ing treated like a Victorian oddity and
soon becomes the center of a more so-
phisticated freak-show.
John Merrick played by John Hurt
gives a knockout performance despite
the fact he is wearing very heavy pros-
thetics. It would be so easy for a film
like this to come across as silly or al-
most mocking, but you feel so much
for John Merrick by the end that I
felt my self welling up. Also Anthony
Hopkins deserves to be remembered
as much for his role as the Doctor
who takes Merrick in as he does for
Hannibal Lecter.
Blue Velvet (1986) starts by toy-
ing with the ideas of a crime/mystery
investigated by a high-schooler and
slowly creeps into a dark underworld
of voyeurism, obsession in a neo-noir
style. Lynch at his best and almost on
a par with Mulholland Drive.
Lost Highway (1997) in my opinion
is harder to follow, but as I said before
Lynch is someone you really have to
immerse yourself in before you can re-
ally enjoy. This is at its core a neo-noir
thriller which is very engaging.
With Mulholland Drive (2001),
you’ve never been further into one
character’s psyche than in this film.
It is a bizarre and deeply engaging
dreamscape, some moments so inti-
mate and then snapping out of them
and pinging into the same place with
a different perspective. Using film to
its full potential to explore the dream
world of a person, Lynch shows us so
much more of person’s workings than
anyone has ever done before. This film
is really a must see for any person with
even the most remote interest in film.
This week we’ve got two cinematic
gems for any film fans; Alfonso
Cuaron’s interstellar stunner Gravity
and to celebrate the imminent release
of the Martin Scorsese’s latest The
Wolf of Wall Street, we’re going old
school and bringing back his classic
crime epic Goodfellas for one night
only.
The tale of two astronauts in peril,
Gravity’splotisminimalist(thedetails
of their ill-fated mission are never
made abundantly clear) but it still
manages to be all-encompassing in
scope as it lets its stunning visuals do
the talking. One particularly indelible
shot of Sandra Bullock’s character as
she tumbles further and further away
into a chasm of darkness, perfectly
captures the insignificance of man in
the face of nature. Be prepared for a
visceral cinematic experience.
Based on a true story, Goodfellas
tells the story of Lucchese crime
family associate Henry Hill’s rise to
infamy as he goes from wannabe
gangster to actual gangster with
plenty of coke and bitchez along
the way. Infused with Scorcese’s
trademark black humour, Goodfellas
portrays the brutal violence and
moral depravity of a life of organised
crime whilst still managing to be
thrillingly entertaining.
