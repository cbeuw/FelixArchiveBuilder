Letters to Felix...
SCARY LETTER
F R O M ACROSS
THE ATLANTIC
Dear Felix:
1 came on your WEB pages on
my son's Internet browser and am
moved to write.
As an American woman with
three children I can state there was
never a King born who wasn't the
son of a whore and wasn't a Queen
born who wasn't one.
A monarchy or a government
based in any part on a monarchy is
simply not a legitimate form of
government. People cannot vote
on whether to swear allegience to a
monarchy. The vote is not legal.
I would favor a United Nations
resolution not recognizing govern-
ments based on Monarchs and the
use of armed forces to bring them
down.
In America, in a place called
Brooklyn across from Brooklyn
Technical high school is a mass
grave of twelve thousand
Americans tortured to death in the
infamous British Prison shops
moored in the East River. All they
had to do to be set free was to
swear allegience to a monarchy.
When my youngest son found
out the English has a King he
explained: "The whole country
must be filled with morons."
You see we believe all men are
created equal, endowed by their
creator with certain inalienable
rights.
In the American State of New
Hampshire the state motto is "Live
Free or Die". I understand the
motto in Shropshire is "Kiss Prince
Charles Ass!".
The United States has a consti-
tution guaranteeing freedoms and
establishing the government gains
legitimacy from the governed and
not the other way around. We have
a second amendment
Guaranteeing the right to keep and
bear arms. Every state also has a
constitution with more rights. In
New Hampshire the state constitu-
tion part I article IIA states: "All
persons have the right to keep and
bear arms in defense of them-
selves, their families, their property
and the state."
Thirty seven United States have
what are called "right-to-carry"
laws mandating police issue a per-
mit to carry one or more concealed
weapons and as much ammunition
as they deem desireable at any
time of day or night. Other state
have "strap-on" laws, which state
you don't even need a permit to
wear a pistol openly on your hip.
Right-to-carry laws guarantee the
right to carry a pistol to any Law
abiding adult male or female.
I regularly carry a snub nosed
.38 stainless steel police special,
and sometimes a dock. My hus-
band prefers a .45 automatic. We
are not gun "nuts". Just ordinary
Americans, amazed at how easily
Great Britain banned guns during a
forty five minute "guilitine" session
of parliament.
As for myself the United States
government would take my gun
only out of my cold dead hand.
A government that denys the
right of a citizen to protect him or
herself should be brought down in
blood.
We own homes in two states
and in Florida every family on the
block owns two or more rifles as
well as a handgun or two. Families
are kept in touch by beepers and
we don't need police if there is
trouble. We have an M-16 in 5.56
caliber NATO in the semi-automat-
ic version and keep handy thirty
magazines fully loaded. A maga-
zine keeps twenty rounds but we
use eighteen to avoid straining the
springs).
The right for a woman to carry
a pistol is especially important. 1
travel in my work and often drive
alone. My life was saved once by
me having a gun in my car.
We have a military M-14 in
7.62 NATO and also keep twenty
ready magazines (twenty rounds
each capacity, but we keep them
filled with eighteen).
We have two shotguns, a semi-
automatic and a pump action with
a pistol grip.
For my sons eigheenth birthday
next month we are buying him his
choice of rifle, which is a Browning
automatic rifle in .308 NATO. It is a
big expense, but will be a collec-
table. We are not terrorists. But we
love freedom.
Every family members knows
we have loaded firearms in the
house at all times and all of my kids
know how to shoot. 1 have taken
them all hunting and we have deer
meat in the freezer. The animal was
shot by my fourteen year old.
You know the interesting thing
is the casualness with which
Americans treat firearms. We do
not feel threatened by our neighbor
coming over for a beer with his
double-action
Smith and Wesson model 59
strapped on, nor do we think it
unusual to drive down the block
with a rifle in the gun rack on the
rear window of our pick-up truck.
That is the difference between
living in a free country, like
America, that puts a space vehicle
on the moon, and a nation like
Great Britain, that doesn't trust its
citizens and swears allegience to a
whore descended from God they
call "The Queen!". Ha.
The citizens of Great Britain
have potential, but they must stand
up for themselves. Freedom is
something very special and is
worth shedding blood for.
Great Britain needs to get rid of
all ties to a monarchy. Try it. You'll
like it. Then you people need a
constitution guaranteeing your
rights.
We have a Freedom of
Information act guaranteeing us
the right to government files.
England has an Official Secrets Act.
Air accidents in the US Air Force are
fully investigated and the results
released to the public.
The Royal Air Force refuses to
release accident investigation files
and this police on the part of British
Aviation.authorities was partly
responsible for the problems with
the Comets, and is the reasons
many Americans will never fly in an
Airbus.
There is no justification for
Great Britain not ennacting a
Freedom of Information Act.
I cannot understand how any
sane rational person could write an
article making a case for the
Monarchy. I guess mental illness
and deficiency are more wide-
spread in England than 1 thought.
You people should come over
to America to live. There are plenty
of jobs, low taxes, and a chance to
be free. 1 am descended from
desertors from the British Navy and
we never look back for a minute.
Keep up your WEB site. It's really
nice.
very truly yours,
Kelly Green
