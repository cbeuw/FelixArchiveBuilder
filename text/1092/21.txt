HACKING IN PROGRESS
COMPUTING 3 October 1997
jacking On [Progress
A Festival of Sorts
Hacking in Progress 1997, a
computer hacking festival of sorts,
was held over three days this sum-
mer at a campsite outside
Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
Incorporating the largest out-
doors non-military network in the
world, with a total of 1,598 com-
puters, 2,523 attendeese, a 100
Mbit network backbone, a 6 Mbit
microwave Internet link and 1
tombstone of a certain Bill Gates,
the conference was a great suc-
cess.
Lectures included computer
security problems, as well as cryp-
tography, as well as emerging stan-
dards for the Internet, such as IPv6
and the World Wide Conferencing
Network (the successor to !RCv2).
The festival included a "hack
the computer" contest, which
degenerated into "hack any com-
puter", mine included.
Note that hacking in the sense
of the festival is more like the old
meaning of hacking; being very
knowledgable about computers.
The event will be held again in
four years, and is currently going
under the name of "Hacking At
Large 2001" (HAL2001 ;-). Check

BUBBLE GUM - THE GAMES SECTION COMING SOON
Actua Golf 2 (playstation)
Gremlin Interactive â€¢ * I
/ 2
Computer golf games are pret-
ty standard these days, with the
game play based on timing the golf
swing against a swing-o-meter. So
what have the programmers put in
this game to make it different?
Running commentaries, water
reflections, new sceneries and a
motion capture facility so that you
can show all your friends that hole
in one.
Commentary seems to be the
in thing to add to sports games
these days, Actua Golf 2 adds
nothing new except for an interest-
ing mixed commentary from Peter
Alliss and Alex Hay (who?). During
the initial learning stages of the
game the commentary became
tiresome and was unsympathetic.
After being repeatedly told how
pathetic my shots were it was very
tempting to switch it off and I'm
not talking about the sound.
Actua Golf 2 has plenty of
options to keep any avid golf fan
happy. Much of the guess work
can be taken out of the game, as
your computer caddy automatical-
ly gives you the most ideal club
and the ball's trajectory can be
indicated by means of an arc.
If you are a golf fan, this is the
only golf game you should buy, the
original Actua Golf was a huge suc-
cess last year and with 6 new
courses you can't really go wrong.

Press Releases
In the Pipeline
This summers ECTS trade show
at Olympia prooved that the games
industry is definitely not running
out of steam. Sony is having an
excellent year in terms of sales and
they showed it by splashing out on
the whole of the west wing of
Olympia. Over a hundred
PlayStations donned the arena,
with Namco's coin-op conversion
of Time Crisis and the most unusu-
al Parappa the Rapper mixing but-
ton tapping with rap music, suiting
a whole range of games prefer-
ences. The game play seems limit-
ed to tapping the control pad at
the right time but with corny rap
lyrics and characters such as a mar-
tial arts instructure with an onion
for a head, had me rolling around
in laughter. Watch out for Final
Fantasy VII, in japan this rpg
became the fastest selling game
ever, while helping to furthur boost
Playstation sales.
Eidos was another big player
this year, and Tomb Raider resuced
Eidos from the depths of dispair
last year. This year's launch of
Tomb Raider 2 (released this
November) was hyped with a look
alike Lara Croft with associated sil-
icone implants and timberlands.
Well with the number vultures,
oops I mean photographers around
her it just goes to show that sex
appeal sells and sells well.
Nintendo has taken much flack
over it's use over expenisve solid
state storage cartridges in their
almost new N64. Goldeneye for
the N64 is a James Bond film tie-in,
its Doom style corridor action will
have N64 owners pleased, the big,
bright, happy smiley graphics of
the Mario series can make anyone
feel slightly nausious after a while.
Starfox, due for release next
month, was on show with the addi-
tional rumble pack. This pack con-
nects to the controller and vibrates
when the console detects a colli-
sion or a hit, it may sound like
another gimmick to drain your bank
account but it does add another
dimension to game interaction.
