questioning about previous crimi-
nal activities.
In a separate incident, the ladies'
changing room in the Imperial
College Sports Centre was the
centre of attention for another
unwanted visitor on night of the
25th. Security was alerted and
two guards chased the peeping
torn out of the centre. In the
ensuing struggle, the man tripped
and fell, breaking his arm and
elbow.

Beef-eaters beware
In Nature published yesterday
(Volume 389), Professor John
Collinge and co-workers from the
prion disease group based at St
Mary's Hospital provide further evi-
dence that the new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD),
which has so far claimed 21 lives in
this country, is caused by the con-
sumption of BSE contaminated
beef.
It has previously been argued
that BSE and vCJD are brought
about by different strains of prion,
the infectious agent responsible for
a range of transmissible neuro-
degenerative diseases, such as
scrapie and kuru, by converting the
normal form of the protein present
in the brain into its pathogenic vari-
ant, which accumulate and lead to
damages to the central nervous
system. Results from earlier exper-
iments suggest that a "species bar-
rier" may exist between human and
cow, which rules out effective con-
version of normal human prion into
its pathogenic strain by the bovine
prion.
However, outcomes from the
latest series of experiments in
which mice were inoculated with
BSE and vCJD prion have convinced
scientists that the two types of
prion are one and the same agent.
Mice which contracted BSE and
vCJD showed striking similarities in
the prion deposition pattern in
their brains. Biochemical analyses
have also identified the pathogenic
prion generated as a result of
exposure to vCJD and BSE to be the
same.
The conclusion of the paper is
that these data provide compelling
evidence that BSE and vCJD are
caused by the same prion strain,
and vCJD is indeed caused by BSE
exposure. The theoretical possibili-
ty that both BSE and CJD arise from
exposure to a common unidenti-
fied source has also been strongly
ruled out.

IC Security goes to
the Dogs
from front page
the sports center. They have
also helped in some "incidents" at
Wilson House and with another
intruder at Evelyn Gardens during
the holidays. It has been admitted
that they have had limited success
so far but this is expected to be
rectified as both the dogs and
handlers get to know the Campus
better. The effectiveness of the unit
will carefully monitored by war-
dens, tutors and techincal staff and
any comments are welcomed.
