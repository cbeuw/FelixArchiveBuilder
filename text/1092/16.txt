MUSIC
3 October 1997
I know what you're thinking. "At
last, the music pages!!" Well, yes,
the following pages of reviews are
by a crack commando squad of
highly-qualified reviewers who live,
breathe, eat and sleep music.
Their only intention in life is to
bring their opinion of the latest
releases to you so you have some-
thing interesting to read in lectures
on a Friday morning.
This week, as well as all the usual
albums and singles, we have part
one of a summer albums round-
up. This will give you a guide to
the best albums released over the
past few months and is truly indis-
pensable.
Every week, we will endeavour to
bring you reviews of everything
from pop to drum 'n bass, from
hip-hop to dance. As well as the
reviews, there is the news column
(which you are currently reading)
which will tell you all the latest
news and gossip from the glitzy
music world. If there's anything
you want to know about your
favourite artist (or indeed anyone)
then write in and ask - this is where
you get your answers.
There will also be countless com-
petitions over the next 30-odd
issues, including ones next week
for Alanis Morrissette, Tori Amos
and Fleetwood Mac videos, so
keep tuned in.

Like rabbits, Dubstar
are frozen in the head-
lights of an approach-
ing second album.
Loaded down with tons of glowing
copy about Disgraceful, the album
thunders toward them, about to
crush them like... well, like roadkill.
Can they break free from the fixat-
ing beams? Can they produce the
follow up to what was in my (and
many other's) opinion, the finest
album of '96?
Although not as instantly accessi-
ble, Dubstar haven't eschewed the
lush melodies and poignant,
Smithsian lyrics of their stunning
debut. Rather, they have expanded
their sound to encompass a much
wider range of influences. Just lis-
ten to the Red Snapper oboe loop
on Inside, and the minimalist, icy
beauty of Polestar for evidence.
And always at the heart of these
songs are minor key melodies,
brought into sharp relief by Sarah's
melancholic delivery. On No More
Talk, a plea for an end to the end-
less dissection of a floundering
relationship, or When you Say
Goodbye, where the acid tang of
paranoia creeps through the drunk-
en last dance, suspicion and jeal-
ousy leading to some serious fang-
baring - "To get my revenge I want-
ed to spike her 1 And laugh in her
face when she's tripping with fear".
Jesus, you twisted bitch! But if it's
blatant pop thrills you're after,
there's still enough to keep you
happy. / Will be your Girlfriend has
such a triumphant little guitar riff it
distracts you from the fact that the
title lyric is no flirtation - it's a
threat. The suffocating stench of
small-town life is smelt on The
View from Here, and soundslike
Abba's The Day Before you Came.
Yes, it's that good. Sadly, Goodbye
loses my attention in the more
string-laden, produced, tracks such
as It's Over or Ghost, which is wor-
ryingly close to lift muzak. But the
final track, Let's Go, restores my
faith, so brimming with defeat and
resignation that as it fades out you
can believe their hearts fade with it,
stilled by the sheer scale of the
ache within.
Back on the road, Disgraceful roars
past. Dubstar blink and realise that
whilst making a worthy successor,
they've survived. Norm H

Finally, don't forget to get
involved. If you want to get free
tickets to gigs, get free music and
other free stuff, and you can write
coherently (or even if you can't!)
then we would love to meet you.
Come to the Felix stall in Freshers
Fair in Beit Quad and sign up. Ther
will be loads of give-aways as well
at the stall so it's definitely worth a
visit! Also check out the article on
the far right.

avid Gavurin. and Harriet
Wheeler probably get sick of
hearing these words - fluffy,
cuddly, lovely, cosywarm and snug.
Thing is, if you're going to make
songs that revel in emoting these
words, what other ways have we to
consider them? These are songs of
people so obviously in love that
alone, one is almost excluded.
Access only available to couples in
the final stages of extreme soppi-
ness. No cynics allowed.
The Sundays seem to have lost the
pop-driven sounds of their essen-
tial debut album, Reading, Writing
and Arithmetic, in favour of more
folky, adult, songs. The single
Summertime is the probably the
only exuberant of all the songs
here, and still only in stoned,
Sunday afternoon kind of way. As
the devotional When I'm Thinking
About You comes along, Harriet
and David seem more like the
hippy-drippy couple crooning to
each other in the Healing Fields at
Glastonbury, totally absorbed by
their mutual love. Which is fair
enough, but at least spare a
moments thought for your rapidly
decreasing audience.
Harsh criticism aside (thank god, it
feels like stoning squirrels), the
album crawls towards redemption
with the inclusion of some fantastic
songs. She waltzes along like the
best song All About Eve never
wrote, all flushed cheeks and
unselfconscious joy. But it's been a
long seven years since 1990, and
while The Sundays have matured
the pop world has become increas-
ingly obsessed with instant thrills.
Although Cry is undoubtedly a well-
crafted song, lyrics like "I'm stand-
ing on the platorm, staring from a
train I the trees roll back really
makes me cry" are indicative of the
retrospective feel to much of this
album.
Of course, my Mum thinks it's
tops, and reckons it'll look really
nice next to her Elton John CDs.

If, after reading these next few
pages, you're thinking to your-
self, "I could do that", then make
your way over to the Felix office
in the north-west corner of Beit
Quad.
If you pass the stringent mental
and physical tests, we will send
you on a three month training
course to Brazil, where you will
learn the finer arts of music jour-
nalism. You will learn how to
write the perfect album review
(200-300 words) as well as how
to get them in on time. You will
be given countless singles to take
back home and you will have to
cast your critical eye over them
for the benefit of your fellow
Imperial students. You will also
be made to inteview and review
gigs of bands of whom you
would sell your granny to meet.
Forget the army, this is what it's
all about. Come to the Felix
office on fridays at 1.30pm to
find out more, or visit us at the
fresher's fair. H
