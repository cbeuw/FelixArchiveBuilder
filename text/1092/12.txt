his summer the Caving Club
returned to Slovenia for the
fourth consecutive year to
continue the exploration of
the caves of the Migovec Plateau.
The cave system which we have
discovered has developed from a
tight and unremarkable cave into
an impressive system containing
huge galleries, vertical pitches,
streams and chambers. The
Migovec System, at 958m deep, is
now the fifth deepest and fourth
longest cave in Slovenia. Potentially
the cave could attain a depth of
1300m which would make it the
second deepest in Slovenia and
make it the deepest cave ever dis-
covered by a British group.
The Tolminski Migovec plateau
is at an altitude of 1800m and is
situated in the Triglav National Park
in north-west Slovenia, bordering
on Italy and Austria. Exploration of
the caves of Migovec was first car-
ried out between 1976 and 1981
by the Tolmin caving club (JSPDT).
During that time they found two
significant caves
which they called
M2 and M I 6
which were 350m
and 547m deep
respectively. The
caves did not join,
although their
entrances were
within 100m of
each other. In M2
a very large 120m
pitch called
'Tolmniski Silos'
was found and
also a massive
chamber called
'Galactica' in
M l 6 . The plateau
has many features
which indicate
good cave poten-
tial; all the rain
water and snow
melt sinks imme-
diately into the
ground and returns to the surface
deep in the surrounding valleys;
the plateau is covered with large
depressions and holes caused by
water erosion and in winter many
holes on the surface 'breathe'
(blow relatively warm air) which
demonstrates that a significant vol-
ume of air is trapped underground.
Despite all the potential for a large
cave system it eluded explorers for
many years.
In 1994 the caving club wrote
to several Slovenian clubs with a
view to setting up an expedition.
We got a reply from Andrej Fratnik
of the JSPDT in Tolmin who gave us
permission to explore the Migovec
Plateau that summer. The 1994
expedition spent six weeks pros-
pecting on the surface of the
plateau and looking for promising
leads. The most important discov-
ery was Torn T-shirt (M18) which is
extremely tight and arduous and
was explored to -78m.

tion, the deepest known cave on

the plateau. M l 6 , was visited.
Many of the members wrote-off
the area as being unpromising, i
Some however, had been in Torn
T-shirt during a violent storm and
had heard the roar of a stream
beyond the squeeze. They felt sure
that there were significant discov-
eries to be made if only we could
force a way through this obstacle.
In '95 we came prepared with
crowbars, hammers, chisels and a
cast iron will, in Torn T-shirt we got
through the squeeze which defeat-
ed us the pervious year
(Optimisqueeze) only to find it lead
immediately to a second squeeze
(Turtle's Head squeeze). We ham-
mered our way through and even-
tually got to a 30m pitch. We were
soon squashed into several even
tighter passages. The absolute
worst was the Nutcracker squeeze
which is so tight that you have to
remove your harness to squeeze
through. All this work meant we
had less than two weeks to explore
the newly discovered NCB
passage. The most
important leads wpre a massive free hanging pitch and a
small crawl from the roof of the passage. The big pitch was
named Godzilla. Every attempt to bottom it was unsuccess-
ful—it took a rock 4.5 seconds to hit the ground, and from
the bottom of 90m ol' rope it was thought that the bottom
was still 20m-30m down. "Had difficulty in threading
descender at the top of new pitch. Went down to first knot
and, in the midst of nothingness, spent 10 mins. trying to
work out how to pass it...kind of scary! Slowly down to sec-
ond knot, the rope hanging closer to the wall. Top of rope
well out of sight and no sign of the floor. Worried now. Down
to end of rope, slowly, very slowly. Tied on the last rope and
went down doing my best not to bounce around (as there
was a bit of a rub point higher up). Nowhere near floor at end
of rope...! reckon another 20m. Thought I could see two pos-
sible ways on at the bottom. Ascend slowly finding it a bit of
an ordeal -my whole life resting on four bits of stretched rope
and a bolt put in by CV Pete!" (diary entry). We had to wait
for next year's expedition to explore further.
Morale was very high in '96. An underground camp was
set up in NCB passage. We were fortunate enough to be lent
a laptop computer by Hewlett Packard, which allowed us dis-
play the map of the cave while we were on top of the moun-
tain and visualise its progression. The first camping trip was
to bottom Godzilla, a team of three went down with plenty
of rope. One member of the team
was the Slovenian caver Andrej
Fratnik. When the bottom was
reached the growing fear that this
was actually part of the cave M 2
was confirmed. Adrej found a plum
stone at the bottom which he had
dropped the last time he was down
there in 1979.
The next trip concentrated on
exploring The Void. Adrenaline was
high, the pitch seemed to be about
40m deep. Eventually we got to the
top of a large pitch. We had found
Level 2, a chamber about 25m high
and 30m in diameter. It has two
pitches in it: Arian 5 (about 30m),
Divine Brown (about 10m). A large
passage also went off in a northern
and southern direction. When the
cave survey was plotted using the
computer we noticed that the new
passages were within 20m of M16
(the other cave explored by the
Slovenians). A lot of effort was put
into trying to find a connection with
M16 and eventually this effort paid
off. We had laid the foundations for
access to the lower parts of the
system.
Arriving in Tolmin this year, we
went to the pizza cafe for the usual
final taste of beer and real meat.
We met Andrej and Simon, two of
the Slovenians, who told us that
the cave was now 700m deep not
281m as we expected. In 1996 we
had found a way off to a 50m pitch
at the end of Exhibition Road
(which we called Bikini Carwash).
Unfortunately we had not enough
time to go down it. The Slovenians
had pushed down this pitch
(named XXX) and found another
even bigger 75m pitch 'Sajeta'. At
the bottom of this was a stream.
This was the first time a stream had
been found in the cave. There are
other wet sections, but they were
only seepage of water through the
rock. This stream had been fol-
lowed down to -700m where the
way on got too dangerous. The
water disappeared through a small
hole, and in a storm it may sump.
However they were not discour-
aged—they had explosives to make
the hole bigger!
At -800m the caves split into
two ways, one wet, one dry. The
first way to be explored was the dry
way. On Monday 4th August a
team returned from camp to the
surface. Every one was waiting for
the news. Unfortunately that part
of the cave only reached 958m
deep, this section was named
'Good not Grand' as it didn't make
the kilometre. At the bottom was a
static sump. This led to discussion
of whether it was the limit of depth.
It is generally considered that it
isn't. Predicting what the cave will
do was a hot topic of discussion.
Our hopes hadn't faded as
there was still the wet way to push.
This Way although wet was not too
wet. Then we hit FA999, the name
gives an indication of what this
pitch was like. It was a 40m wet
pitch, unfortunately the stream
breaks up and fills the whole pitch
with spray. The water temperature
is about 1°C. It took two camping
trips to bottom the pitch. We were
910m deep and the water disap-
peared through a crawl which we
could fit through, but you had to
get very wet to do so. Additionally,
we were unsure how quickly the
stream reacted to heavy rain
storms, a pulse flood in such an
area would very dangerous. On
FA999 there was no room for mis-
takes. We decided that at this
stage we should look elsewhere for
leads. Again the 1 km had escaped
our reach.
What we had found in previous
years happened again—some of
the best leads were made fairly
close to the end of the expedition,
leaving a number of exciting leads
for next year. The Slovenian cavers
no doubt will be doing some explo-
ration in the cave. The cave has
developed from a small shaft series
to a world class system that is
Slovenia's most important recent
discovery. There has been a one
hour program on radio Slovenia
discussing the exploration of the
system. It was also one the high-
lights in the recent British caving
conference and the deepest dis-
covery by a long way! It has been a
privilege to explore in this area.
If you think you want a piece of
this action then why not try caving?
We will have a stall at the Freshers
Fair. You never know, you could
soon be exploring system Migovec,
1 km under the ground and making
history...
