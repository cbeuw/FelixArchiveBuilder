London Imperial Network for Education
Development
Do you want to have a say in your own education?
Does the way we learn and create knowledge interest you?
Do you want to join a team who are involved in developing
student learning at Imperial College?
Are you interested in visiting universities across Europe to dis-
cuss the way students learn in other countries?
Do you want to help design new courses which meet industry's
needs?
Can you help us to develop student's creativity and innovation?
We hope to set up a network of
students in each department to
join with the ICU president and
the LINKED team of staff edu-
cation developers, in creating
the future of the way students
learn at Imperial College. If
you are interested in taking
park in this unique initiative,
please contact Caroline Baillie
on 46084 or C. Baillie@ic.ac.uk
or visit her in the Materials
Department. First years are
welcome. Motivation and
interest are more important
than experience.

Editorial
Hello, Hello, Hello
Greetings all new and returning
students (and those unfortunate
enough to be here all summer). For
those who don't know, Felix is IC's
free students' newspaper. It's writ-
ten and produced entirely by stu-
dents and is funded partly by
Imperial College Union and partly
by advertising income. Unusually,
though, we have editorial freedom
from ICU so that we can print what
we like (so long as it is legal).
If you picked up this copy from
your hall, I'm afraid that's a novel-
ty. Felix usually appears in piles in
the larger departments on Friday
mornings. We like to do our bit for
your academic standing by giving
you a reason to vacate your warm
den on a Friday morning.
Headless Chickens, and Other
Creatures
ICU currently lacks a President
and a Deputy President for Clubs
and Societies. While the lack of DP
C&S is unfortunate, the missing
President is a sorry indicator of the
indifferent attitude common at
Imperial College. Granted, turnout
rose considerably over last year,
but it still represented less than a
quarter of those eligible to vote.
After ejecting the first two rounds
of candidates, the electorate
seemed to gain a nihilistic bent to
prevent even the most competent
hopeful from succeeding. Block
voting tactics at the St. Mary's
campus were also to blame,
though perhaps this was due in a
larger part to poor planning than
vindictiveness. With the aim of
throwing more weight behind their
votes, they have inadvertently put
all students at a disadvantage.
New elections are set for 1 I
November, and I sincerely hope
their are taken in the correct spirit;
great fun, but extremely important.
Thursday Evening, 7pm
On Monday, 1 was apprehen-
sive, but confident. By Tuesday
lunchtime, a certain feeling of
dread had set in. Wednesday was
grim, but quiet. Where were all my
contributors? What had happened
to the articles that I had been faith-
fully promised? I slogged through
to lam, which I know is not partic-
ularly late, once again cursing my
unfounded faith in people and my
foolish belief that they will do what
they say, when they say. Not that
I'm any better myself.
But now it's Thursday evening,
and already I've broken my unwrit-
ten, personal vow not to keep the
printers here after hours. And still
the arts page is blank.
So the symbolic first issue is
completed (almost). It's good, but
it's far from brilliant. As an album, it
would get two-and-a-half stars,
maybe three. I hope you like it
more than I do. And if you think
you could do better, you know
where to come...

Believe it or not, we do our best
to get our facts right. This is, of
course, an impossible task, as our
news comes from people, and
people lie, and people make mis-
takes. We make mistakes too,
errors, typos and misjudgments.
If you feel that something in Felix
was inaccurate, unfair or totally
fabricated, let us know and we'll
print a correction or an apologise
- the errers and box.
