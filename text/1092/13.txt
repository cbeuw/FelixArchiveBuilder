We take a look at some of the
films currently in the cinema that
you may have missed over the
summer...
My Best Friend's
Wedding
Starring: Julia Roberts, Dermot
Mulroney, Cameron Diaz
Director: P] Hogan
The most successful romantic
comedy ever is an odd one.
Roberts plays Jools, a vicious food
critic who has been the best friend
of Michael (Mulroney) for eight
years. On hearing of his impending
marriage to the young, beautiful
Kimmy (Diaz) she realises that she
feels more than just friendship for
him and so sets out to ruin the
wedding by any means necessary.
This clearly isn't the sort of
activity that romantic comedy leads
usually get up to. But, as many
reviewers of this film seem not to
have noticed, we're not expected
to root for Jools. When she humili-
ates Kimmy in a karaoke bar it is
the naive girlfriend we feel for, not
the manipulative "best friend". So
this strange plot doesn't put us off
some truly hilarious sequences,
usually centred around Rupert
Everett playing a gay friend of Jools.
He's drafted in to pretend to be her
fiancee in an attempt to make
Michael jealous, but is too camp to
be convincing and is uncomfortable
with the deception. Everett steals
every scene he's in with a combina-
tion of great lines and quality phys-
ical comedy.
In fact, all the actors are
impressive, except the slightly dull
Mulroney who doesn't seem the
sort of guy that women would fight
over. However, what sets this film
apart from so many others in this
genre is that rarest of attributes: an
unpredictable ending.
Air Force One
Starring: Harrison Ford, Gary
Oldman, Glenn Close
Director: Wolfgang Petersen
Harrison Ford was born to be
the US president, so playing him is
probably good practice. He
certainly starts off well, giving a
publicity grabbing speech saying
that he will never succumb to ter-
rorist threats. These honourable
motives soon become tested to the
limit, however, as Air Force One is
hijacked by terrorists demanding
the release of a Russian revolution-
ary leader. The President and his
family are on board at the time and
this action thriller sees Ford sneak-
ing around the plane trying to save
the hostages.
As far as films of this type go,
this is excellent stuff. Breathtaking
visuals and sound combine with
Ford's usual stylish hero to make
this the best action film of the
summer.
"Okay, okay, I'm sorry. You did
look great in The Full Monty"
Starring: Robert Carlyle, Ray
Winstone, Steven Waddington
Director: Antonia Bird
Another heist-goes-wrong film,
this time set in the heart of gang-
ster London. Five robbers fall out
after discovering they've only
nicked a fraction of the two million
quid they were expecting. Honesty
among thieves is soon discarded as
one of them helps himself to the
booty and so the villains start fight-
ing amongst themselves.
Quality acting and some
inspired directing make this a
superior thriller.
The Full Monty
Starring: Robert Carlyle, Tom
Wilkinson, Mark Addy
Director: Peter Cattaneo
Haven't seen it actually. But,
absolutely everybody who has says
it's "bloody amazing". Six un-
employed men try their luck at
stripping in their local club. And
that's about it, but apparently it's
insanely hilarious so go and see it.

Men In Black
Starring: Will Smith, Tommy-
Lee Jones, Linda Fiorentino
Director: Barry Sonnenfold
If you haven't heard of this then
you're probably one of the aliens
that feature in it. The brilliant Smith
combines with the ultra-cool Jones
to protect humanity from the
extraterrestrial vermin that infests
our planet. Together they are the
Men In Black, stopping illegal immi-
grants eating humans and driving
taxis.
The two leads work together
perfectly and the special effects are
great - the only problem with this
excellent film is that it's too short.
