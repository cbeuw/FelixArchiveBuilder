Welcome to Imperial?
As some of you may have
noticed we have 6 rather unusual
new freshers this year namely
George, Major, Tango, Chas,
Major! and Archie; IC's new secu-
rity dogs in residence.
Chief Security Officer Ken Weir
took 9 months to decide what
could be done to lower crime levels
on campus and chose dogs for
their were cost-effectiveness. On
other campuses where they have
been used, women have indicated
that they felt safer, especially when
walking after dark.
When dogs were used in a pilot
scheme at Clayponds between
November and July last year, crime
dropped by 90%. They are also very
mobile.
The dogs are all male German
Shepherds around two years old.
They were supplied and trained by
Chartwell l<9, who have been in the
business for nearly 50 years, to
Home Office guidelines and have

pedigree checks to ensure that
they pose no danger to staff and
students going about their busi-
ness.
Of the handlers only one came
from in-house, the other 5 being
selected from 340 applicants by a
panel that included the Cheif
Instructor at Chartwell. All but two
have previous experience. The
dogs live with their handlers and
cost about £ 10 a week to keep not
Southside Torrent
A mains water supply, running
across the top of Southside, burst
over Staircases Seven and Eight on
the 7th of September at around
9pm. The water flowed from the
pipe at an estimated gallon a sec-
ond and ran across the roof
toward the other side of the build-
ing, leaking down into the floors
below as it went. Engineers were
forced to drain the water tank that
supplied the pipe, shutting off the
mains supply first and then turning
on all the taps and showers in the
building waiting almost an hour for
it to empty. The water managed to
reach ground level in about forty-
five minutes, passing through the
wardrobes and doorframes that
run from floor ro celing in each
room. Most staircases were dam-
aged, the rooms on Staircases Six,
Seven and Eight being the worst
affected. The top levels of those
staircases were completely flood-
ed and around a hundred and fifty
people had to be evacuated to
Beit, Weeks and Linstead Halls
with some damage to their prop-
erty. It is unknown whether the
Imperial College insurance policy
covers this kind of accident.
As the event occured on a
Sunday night, no senior staff were
available to supervise an evacua-
tion of around eighty people from
their swamped rooms, but recep-
tion staff and the Linstead house-
keeper, Sheena McDonagh, dealt

including their insurance which
covers them against vets bills and
any action that may be brought due
to the dogs' behaviour. The initial
set-up costs were- approximatley
£2000 - £3000 per dog.
On the practical side of things
any mess that the dogs make
should be cleared up instantly and
for the asmathics out there worry-
ing about all that hair, the dogs will
only go inside a building to assist in
an emrgency such as an alarm or if
an intruder is reported. In that case
they will be there as back-up for the
handler; there is an enormous psy-
chological advantage to having a
dogs; it bolsters the confidence of
the handler whilst studies have
shown that criminals are reluctant
to go up against a canine oppo-
nent. The dogs will never be
released however.
It has been stressed that these
dogs, whilst not attack dogs as
used by the armed forces and the
like, are not pets either and should
not be stroked if only because this
would make them accustomed to
kindness from strangers and would
make them less effective whilst on
patrol.
So far the animals have assisted
in patrols during the London
Fashion week, held at Imperial, and
helped in the detainment of a man
arrested for breach of the peace at
