SUMMER ALBUMS
Summertime, and the living is easy.
Part one of our Summer Albums
Roundup - eightdisks you really
should consider buying. Like,
today.
S U B C I R C U S
Carousel
Last time I reviewed this I was,
well, a little uncharitable. But, it
seems, the boys done good.
Worth it just for 86'ci.
E C H O & T H E
B U N N Y M E N
Evergreen

Gorgeously full of strings and
strained vocals, this is a album full
of surprises.

You deserve no respect if you
don't already have this....'nuff
said. This is surely album of the
year.
O A S I S
Be Here Now
A lot of hype, a lot of publicity and
out drops one fine rock 'n roll
album of classic Oasis moments.
B E N T L E Y
R Y T H M A C E
Bentley Rythm Ace
Interesting arrangements and pro-
duction. Worth a listen or ten.
P O R T I S H E A D
All Mine
NIIISHUII!
Those hoping for more Dummy
may have doubts, but I'm sure this
album will gain pride of place in
the Lo-Fi hall of Fame. Fine.
P R O D I G Y
The Fat Of The Land
The follow-up to Jilted justified
everyone's long wait and it sold
pretty well too.
H U R R I C A N E #1
Hurricane # 1
From the almost psychedelic 5rep
Into My World to the remaining
guitar-driven cuts, this is a tri-
umphant return for e-ride man
Andy Bell with a new band in tow.
