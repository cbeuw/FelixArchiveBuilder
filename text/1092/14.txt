REVIEWS A N D COMPETITIONS
Jodie Foster returns after a
break of three years to play a sci-
entist who devotes her life to lis-
tening to the airwaves, waiting for a
message from space. Her prayers
are answered when she receives an
extraterrestrial transmission giving
instructions on how to build an
alien ship, but there's a problem.
Sent with the D1Y guide is an image
of Hitler giving a speech, which
understandably raises doubts in the
US government about the motives
of our intergalactic neighbours.
Based on an award winning
novel this is far above the usual
standard of Hollywood sci-fi. It
examines the different attitude
between religious believers and sci-
entists to the questions of faith and
proof and, whilst hardly being
degree level philosophy, makes for
a pleasant change to the
Independence Day approach to
aliens.
At times the whole thing
becomes a bit too Forrest
Gumpified in overdoing the senti-
mentality and superimposed
effects. In general, however, this is
a first class film which develops a
sense of wonder about space not
seen since Close Encounters.
Every week this term the gener-
ous people at the Odeon
Kensington are donating the prizes
for Felix's weekly film competition.
Each Friday you'll have the chance
to win pairs of tickets and
memorabilia from the latest
Hollywood blockbusters.
For those of you new to the
area the OK is located in High
Street Kensington. Walk to the
other side of the Royal Albert Hall
from College and turn left and
you'll come to it after ten minutes.
Bean
Starring: Rowan Atkinson
Director: Mel Smith
The idiotic Mr Bean ends up in
America as a representative of the
Royal National Gallery in this con-
version to the big screen.
Circumstances see him mistaken
for an art expert asked to officiate
at the opening of the greatest US
painting ever, with the usual
disastrous results.
If you're a fan of the TV show
then you'll love this but for those
who dislike the rubber-faced
weirdo this isn't recommended.
There's only a small amount of
character development and noth-
ing to convert those who aren't
already fans.
To kick off we have four pairs
of tickets for you and a mate to see
any film out this month. For a
chance to win simply drop into the
Felix office (in the corner of Beit
Quad next to dBs) with the answer
to the following:
Which actress is returning for
more alien-bashing in next
month's Alien 4?
Austin Powers:
International
Man of Mystery
Starring: Mike Myers, Liz Hurley
Director: Jay Roach
Wayne's World's Mike Myers
returns to the big time with a spoof
of the worst of 1960s psychedelic
films. By day he is a photographer
but by night he is a secret agent,
fighting the frightening Doctor Evil.
The whole film makes a mock-
ery of every Bond film ever made
in a very stylish way. Don't expect
much of a storyline and you'll find
this seriously amusing stuff.

Kidman on an international man
hunt trying to track down terrorists
who have stolen a nuclear bomb.
Following an "accidental" explo-
sion in Russia, governments world-
wide are on red alert and so

and finest intelligence officer are
called upon to defuse a global
crisis.
