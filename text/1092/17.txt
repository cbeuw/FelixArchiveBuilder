The Verve: Happy
as ever.
W hen the Verve dis-
banded after 1995's
album A Northern Soul,
the split seemed com-
plete. There seemed no chance of
them re-forming and certainlly no
chanvce that they could make
much of a comeback. This seemed
to sadden a lot of people as The
Verve represented, to them, the
kind of band that were generals of
the army groups who produced
songs that ached with emotion
whilst maintaining hardly any
cheesy ballad-like qualities about
them. They were the then kings of
'northern' soul, something they
themselves obviously realised
when naming their second album.
Richard Ashcroft's voice always
seemed to have a stern 'life should
not be like this and that's why 1 am
singing about it' air to it and Nick
McCabe's guitar was beautifully dif-
ferent every time he used it: distor-
tion here or there; hardly loud
enough to hear in other placesetc.
So why did they break-up?
Information on these sort of things
is never very forthcoming from
press and record companies, but
the rumours flew around. There
were then the rumours about what
each band member was going to
do with his career afterwards
(including ones about McCabe join-
ing the Stone Roses after John
Squire's hasty exit). Supposedly,
what the time apart did give them
was time enough to decide that
The Verve couldn't die.
Urban Hymns is a good a way of
describing the music that The Verve
produce as northern soul was back
in 1995. This is a collection of
songs that will burrow themselves
into your sub-concious in such a
way that you will be humming the
tunes to yourself for weeks after
you've heard them. The gorgeous
strings arrangement on the album's
opener (and first single) A
Bittersweet Symphony is typical of
the mood as well as the sound of
the whole album. Lyrics Ike "It's a
bittersweet symphony this life/ tr
ing to make ends meet, you're a
slave to money then you die" are
brilliant in their simplicity and direc-
tion. Then there's Sonnet which
has the best melody of any song
this year. Of course, the second
single from this album, the recently
released The Drugs Don't Work is
worth mentioning because of it's
bare production that gives it a
haunting ambience that accen-
tautes it's sheer beauty (sorry to
get soppy...)
It's not all medium-paced rock
anthems, though. As the album
progresses, the lyrics expose more
and more of the Verve's soul and
what lies underneath. They are a
rock band, after all, and they
remind everyone with tracks like
Come On and The Rolling People
which stay on the right side of
heavy. I'm running out of space
here, so I'll just tell you that you
have to get this album, OK? And
no ifs or buts... Alok H

t must have been some two
years ago now. We had taken
our lives in our hands and trav-
elled to the murky depths of Illford,
a grim little nowhere station her-
alded a grim little nowhere town. A
perfect situation then for one Mr.
Stephen Morrissey. We had
expected to be surrounded by 30
somethings, hankering for a past
when they had soothed their awk-
ward teenage anxst at the alter of
the Smiths. What we got was the
next generation of lost souls,
mouthing every word, not to This
Charming Man or How soon is
Now but to anything and every-
thing from Morrisseys then latest
offering Vauxhall and 1. Looking
"around 1 could well believe that
these pimple faced devotees
weren't out of their prams when
The Smiths first sang "but Heaven
knows I'm miserable now" and
that, sorry, is the point.

debacle, Saint or Sinner? It has
always been easy to take the piss,
set him up, the runt of the litter
destined to freeze without Marr to
look out for him. So where are
you now Johnny? Where indeed
are all the journalists who relished
the demise with such open hostil-
ity? Go on admit you were wrong.
See, such is the fervour that
Morrissey can inspire. If you don't
like him now, didn't like him then,

a small bur devoted following.
Spinning, their second album, is
apparently their foray into "electri-
fied raunch". And a sound move k
While the 'Martha's Harbour'
strumming of Higher marks out
their sound as fundamentally folky,
Natasha and Sharon (sharing song-
writing, vocal and guitar credits)
soon prove they have a vicious
bite when provoked. Mean Girl
sounds like an out-take from PJ
Harvey's debut album, Dry, as it
spits and twists around a crushing
guitar riff. Curiously, the drummer
is Rob Ellis, who used to play with
er.., P| Harvev. Indeed, his contri-
lyrics like "He says he is 'curious' I
Says he wants to 'touch me' with
his finger I Claims he's got an
itch". This confessional style is
often used to great effect, as on
"Rubber Arms", a scream of pent-
up fury about sexual frustration.

Bjork-ish storytelling of Higher and
Sweet Butterfly tell tales of d.
Imagine if the High Pixie herself
had been brought up in Somerset

be going to edge of their cliff to
throw little things off. So when the
