ICU K i c k e d in the
Ballots
Imperial College Union (1CU) is
to begin the academic year with
only half the usual compliment of
sabbatical staff. The Union current-
ly lacks a President and a Deputy
President for Finance and Services.
Last year's president, Eric Allsop,
has agreed to stay on to steer ICU
through a round of elections for
these posts, due to be held on 1 1
November.
The sabbaticals ('sabbs') are
elected students chosen during the
second term, who fill four posts at
ICU for the subsequent academic
year - those of President, Deputy
President (Clubs &. Societies),
Deputy President (Finance &.
Services) and Felix Editor. Only the
latter two posts have been filled, by
Rob Clark and Jeremy Thomson
respectively, after student voters
repeatedly chose to re-run the
presidential elections, and the
DP(F&S)-elect, Smita Chaturvedi,
will be unable to take her up her
post for not being "in good acade-
mic standing", according to Eric
Allsop.
The bizarre chain of events
resulting in the current situation
has its roots in March when two
candidates, Sam Baker and Omar
Kier, ran for the post of president.
Both ran on 'joke' manifestos, and
when Mr Kier withdrew, Ms Baker
was defeated with over 1000 stu-
dents voting for 'New Election'. Mr
Clark, Mr Thomson and Ms
Chaturvedi were chosen for their
posts in elections held concurrently.
Fresh presidential ballots
organised in May saw three candi-
dates standing: Oliver Newman, Ali
Hussein and Clare Bunston. Mr
Newman, a fourth year civil engi-
neer, withdraw from the race after
being offered a job. Mr Hussein
also withdrew, only to later try to
"withdraw his withdrawal", which is
not permitted under election rules.
Ms Bunston, the only remaining
candidate, was left to be defeated
by New Election.
The third round, held in June,
had a similar outcome in spite of
the perceived quality of the four
new candidates. The then-RCSU
president and favourite for the ICU
premiership, M o Dulloo, sensa-
tionally pulled out from the race,
having also been offered employ-
ment. On counting the ballot
papers, it emerged that the vast
majority of students at St. Mary's
had voted en masse for Paul Brown
without specifying a second
choice; cast by single transferable
vote, Richard Stultiens was
knocked out first, with the remain-
ing votes split between Laurie
Tweedale and Paul Brown.
However an even larger chunk of
the vote was won by New Election
and with Mr Brown's votes elimi-
nated, "new election won almost
by default," Mr Allsop told Felix.
Now, in a situation has not

occurred since the mid-1970s,
presidential elections must be
organised yet again, as well as
those for DP (C&S).
Although Mr Allsop intends to
stay on beyond his original tenure,
he says that he must continue with
his interrupted PhD of which he has
completed "two and three quarter
years." "1 really have other things to
do with my life," he added, though
he stressed that he did not want to
see harm come to ICU. Once a
candidate is voted in, he intends to
give them a shortened handover
after which he will resume his stud-
ies. In spite of Sarah Corneille's
absence there will be a union
administrator to instruct the new
DP(C&5) incumbent. As regards
logistical problems with organising
more elections, he said that he has
"considerable concerns about the
electoral register". A list of regis-
tered students is not normally
available until Christmas so screen-
ing ineligible voters would be much
harder than usual.
One option would be to com-
pile a list of students as they voted,
effectively creating an electoral roll
in reverse, against which any possi-
ble vote-rigging could be later
checked. Candidates, he added,
should also be aware of the kind of
students who would vote in a
November ballot. "Most need to
appreciate that the entirety of year
1 and the majority of higher years
will have registered. Postgrads...
are reluctant to go into the melee."
Mr Allsop, who was originally
elected in March 1996, told Felix
that the election date of November
1 I th was "set in stone". He went to
say that "...people want a person
they can believe in... the presi-
dent's role is quite important. The
meeting with the Rector isn't just
for show." With the introduction of
the new Charter, the ICU President
is due to become a full member of
the governing body instead of
merely being an observer as
before. Hoping for increased fresh-
er interest in the vote, he added,
"These elections aren't necessarily
a bad thing... it's a unique opportu-
nity for first years to influence
[union politics] and could create a
greater interest in ICU."
Papers go up on Monday 13
October, outside the Union office.

SMOKE
In mid-September, the Nat West
cash machine in the Sherfield
building overheated and caught
fire. The alarm was raised ini-
tially by a student when the
machine failed to dispense her
cash, and soon after Ian Gillet,
Safety Officer, spotted smoke
rising from the screen.
Hari Nair, manager of the IC
branch of Nat West, was soon
on the scene. Under supervision
from Ian Gillet, he opened the
door to the machine room
allowing in air at which point
the machine flashed into
flames. Thick smoke hampered
proceedings, but a Security
Officer was able to extinguish
the blaze.
The fire is belived to have been
caused by the print head in the
recipt-printer overheating and
igniting the ribbon and casing.
The burned parts have been
taken for anaylsis by the fire
brigade, and the findings may
result in alterations to all
machines of the same model, of
which about seventy are still in
use in the UK.
The cash survived the fire
unharmed, and a replacement
machine is now in operation.

MEN BEHAVING
BADLY
An intruder was arrested by police
on the night of the 16th of
September after he was discov-
ered wandering the staircases of
the Southside building. The man,
whose name is not known,
entered Southside at about half
past nine, slipping past the two
security guards on duty. It is
believed he made his way to
Staircase six where he attempted
to make a girl kiss him, grabbing
her wrist as she walked past. The
girl, a vacation guest at the Halls,
knocked him away and alerted
security who called in the police.
They arrested the man after an
extensive search of the building
and found that he was wanted for
