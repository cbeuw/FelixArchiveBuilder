Hi LICENCE TO
DRINK
Dear Felix
This is just a little letter to let
you all know what has been hap-
pening about the Union and it's
pursuit of a Public Ents. Licence for
the bars and dBs.
After two visits to court, a lot of
sweaty palms, a considerable
amount of time and effort, we are
now happy to tell you that the
Union holds a full PEL, with Music
and Dancing. Basically this means
that there will be regulated late
night bar openings on a
Wednesday (until midnight) and
Friday (lam), without any prob-
lems of licences being refused,
which has happened on a number
of occasions during the last two
years.
To the Union, this is a huge
improvement, and allows us to
offer you a much more reliable
series of events.
However, this benefit comes
with certain responsibilities, and
we can only hope to keep the
licence with your co-operation. The
Police and Licensing Authority have
imposed certain conditions on our
licence, and the main ones that will
effect you are:
Complaints about behaviour
and noise after an event may result
in the license being withdrawn. So
please be quiet when leaving the
area. The loss of the licence for
your bar and events could be lost
for everyone, as a result of an indi-
vidual. Don't let that person be
you.
Capacity for Carnivals has had
to be reduced by 100 on the
grounds of Health and Safety, so
you'll need to get tickets even ear-
lier !
We must now charge for entry,
during the period of any extension.
This means that on a Wednesday
night we will now have to charge
50p after 1 1pm. But of course if
you get there early it's still free.
Individual rooms within the
venue now have an official capaci-
ty, so there is a chance that should
a room, say the Union Bar, be
deemed too full, a Union steward
will ask you to use another bar.
This may seem petty, but a breach
of this fire regulation may see us
lose our Licence.
The Police have re-iterated that
we cannot operate a "one in one
out" door policy, as we are in a
residential area.
We cannot emphasise enough
the importance of this Licence to
the Union, and the benefits to you,
in being able to provide a safe, fun
and value for money entertain-
ments, where the profits are re-
invested in other services for you.
Please co-operate with us and
help us to reach the high standards
the authorities will expect, we have
worked hard to get this licence,
help us to make the most of it.
Above all else though have a bril-
liant year.

EDITOR COMES
CLEAN
It's Friday, term has not yet
started, the college is quiet and
relaxed. No people, no action - no
letters. Tradition dictates that we
make up a few spurious entries of
dubious value to fill up this page,
but I'm feeling too stressed to be
humourous. Take it away, Tom...
A LOAD OF LIES
Dear Felix,
1 am an Imperial graduate
from 2001, and I have just fallen
through a hole in time from the
future to this week, my freshers
week. I would like to take this
oppurtunity to complain about the
quality of this year's felix. The fea-
tures are going to be boring, espe-
cially the one on the sex life of the
average student, the layout is terri-
ble, and the editor refused to sell
his playstation to me all year.
But on a good note, the destruc-
tion of the Queens tower was
funny, as was the giant fruit fly that
escaped from biochemistry. I also
completly agree with the next
letter.
Yours temporally
Tom Parkinson
T U T O R S
W A N T E D !
As you hopefully know by
now, Imperial College has a
scheme whereby students spend
one afternoon each week going
into local schools and helping
the kids with science or maths.
It's perfect for would-be
teachers as well as those just
after a rewarding break from
their studies. It's also a good
laugh, with plenty of social
events throughout the year.
For more info seek us out at
the Fresher's Fair - we're in the
Ante Room.
