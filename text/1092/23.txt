SPORT 3 October
Sailing team keep
it up for 24 hours
Coleraine, Northern Island was
the location for the ICU Sailing Club
annual holiday, on 22-23 June. The
event was a 24 hour race, with an
entry of 25 teams from all over the
UK. Imperial sent two teams, and
with the IC Old Boys, this was the
largest presence at the event ever.
The race was dominated by
Imperial I, who led from start to
finish, despite some excellent sail-
ing by Exeter early on the Sunday
morning.
Imperial II recovered from a
capsize on the first lap to fininsh
fourth, helped by the storming per-
formance of commodore James
Silvey. Both the Old Boys teams
also finished in good positions.
To finish off the superb week-
end, IC took home most of the
prizes, and were presented with a
vase marking the 25th consecutive
year that Imperial sent a team. In
addition to this, we drank, smoked
and danced more that the other
clubs.
Congratulations also go to ICSC
sailor Chris Balding, who has won
the Mirror class world champi-
onship, held in Canada. Well done!

Summer of Fun for Gliding Club
Afandi in action in ICCC's ASW-Z4 glider
The Gliding Club achieved a first
in it's 67 year history this summer
when 3 members represented
Great Britain in European Gliding
Championships. Afandi Darlington
and Peter Masson formed part of
the 6 man team in the 4th
European Junior Gliding
Championships at Musbach,
Germany and Jane Lewis competed
in the European Women's Gliding
Championships which were held at
Preivdza, Slovakia. The Junior event
bought 67 pilots from 21 countries
together to compete above the
steep wooded slopes of the Black
Forest in Southern Germany.
Afandi, Peter and Jane all learnt to
fly with ICGC whilst at Imperial
College, and Afandi and Jane serve
as instructors for new student
pilots.
The competition involved rac-
ing gliders around cross country
tasks at the fastest possible speed.
In order to fly these motorless air-
craft across the countryside pilots
must make use of thermal upcur-
rents to climb in, and then convert
that height into distance by gliding
straight, descending as they go.
The strong thermals we encoun-
tered in Germany combined with
high cloudbases made for excellent
racing conditions. After 10 hard
fought competition days Peter fin-
ished 10th in the Club Class and
Afandi finished 7th in the Standard
Class.
Gliding may be seen as an inac-
cessible sport but luckily Imperial
College has an excellent gliding
club, with a long and distinguished
history stretching back to the pio-
neering days of
British gliding in 1930. The club
has 3 gliders comprising of 1 two
seater in which you can learn to fly
with BGA qualified instructors, and
2 single seaters for solo flying when
you're up to solo standard.
Aerobatics can also be included if
you have the nerve! (see photo).
The gliding club meet in
Aeronautics Room 252 on
Thursdays at 1 pm during which trail
lessons can be booked.

captain, Yvonne Thorn on 0171

THE END OF THE
DROUGHT FOR RCSU
CRICKET TEAM
A sixteen-year losing streak has been bro-
ken - the RSC Union beat the RSC
Association. The two major modes of trans-
port taken to Harlington were Jez for the
foolhardy and an ICU minibus for the stupid
- Matt was nervous driving it and was well
and truly wound up by Rob P.
After a quick change, Captain Dave went
to inspect the field, it being unusually dry for
the recent rain, but still quite green. The out-
field still had Sahara-like qualities. The toss
was won by RCSU and thinking it would be
easier to chase runs, we took the field.
Andy F and Dave W opened the bowling.
Andy was unfortunate enough to conceed 29
- 0 in 9 overs. Dave picked up a couple of
wickets, though, with a superb catch from
Nat W at 1 st slip.
Dave E bowled the trophy scalp of Careth
Smith, and Rob P lobbed a few interesting
overs. Nat W blasted the middle orders away
with 1- 3 in 3 overs before Dave W returned
to see off a few more. RCSA declared at tea,
with 135 for 7.
Things initially went fairly badly for our
batsmen, with a catch and an indifferent LBW
doing it for the openers. A Pie-thrower of a
bowler proved too tempting for the middle
order, who got themselves out. The tail
enders endured to turn the game around,
with Rob P hitting the winning runs. During
the innings, Gareth Smith bowled an interest-
ing 'over' - six wides and one no-ball - before
being illegally whisked off with a feigned
injury and installed behind the stumps.
We were gallant in victory, and in the bar,
heralding a run to carry on to next year.
