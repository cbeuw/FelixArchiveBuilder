THEATRE
Scapln's Tricks
Wimbledon Studio Theatre
Scapin's Tricks is Moliere's
most hilarious comedy. Now
before you all shake your heads in
horror and cry: 'French comedy!
What's that?', read on. This is farce
at its best.
Leandro's cheeky servant,
Scapin, and Geronte's servant,
Silvestro, have the unenviable task
of keeping their young masters,
Ottavio and Argante, out of trouble
while their fathers are away on
business. As you can imagine,
things do not go quite to plan.
When their masters return, they
discover that both young men have
fallen in love with two Young girls.
Naturally enough their fathers are
not impressed with their
escapades, particularly as the one
woman is a gypsy, the other of
doubtful origin and both without
money or connections. Geronte, an
irascible domineering man, and
Leandro, a penny-pinching laugh-
ing-stock, want an alliance between
their two houses and so they do
ARTS 21
their utmost to break up their sons'
relationships. Ottavio and Argante
turn to Scapin for help and here the
tale of plots, counterplots and
unexpected twists of fate begins.
Scapin, played by Jonathan
Ashley, brought the house down
with his antics. His desire not only
This is farce
at it's best
to help Ottavio and Argante and
their mistresses, but at the same
time to line his own pockets at the
expense of his gullible master and
to extract revenge on him were the
mainstays of the play. Ashley acted
out his part with body and soul and
most of the time his facial expres-
sions conveyed more than any of
Moliere's words could. Similarly,
the young men daydreamed about
the stage, took offense at any
imaginary slight of their love and
kept us all in stitches.
I was less impressed with the
women actors, who were stiff and
woodenly overacted their parts.
However, Moliere's script did not
give them very much scope and
they have to spend most of their
time standing about the stage or
bustling from one corner to the
other.
The Wimbledon Studio Theatre
is a small fringe theatre with an inti-
mate atmosphere. I recommend
you go along some time even if you
miss Scapin's Tricks. Wherever you
sit you are next to the stage so you
end up far more involved in the
play than you would in a big West
End theatre with the view obscured
by a large pillar. The productions
themselves are equally good and
more often than not, you get to
meet the actors afterwards.

Don McCullin
Sleeping with Ghosts
Don McCullin (b. 1935) is one
of the world's greatest and most
famous photo-journalists. His
career spans four decades (1959 to
1997) and three continents
(Europe, Africa and Asia). During
this time he has worked for The
Observer, The Sunday Times and
lately as a freelance, often risking
his life to capture history in the
making. His work provides a social
documentary and, in a way, a social
conscience of our times, raising
moral and social problems which
would otherwise have gone largely
unnoticed. Certain key elements
act as a leitfaden throughout his
work: extreme poverty, racial
issues, ethnic conflicts, war. The
first major retrospective of Don
McCullin's career, this exhibition at
the Barbican is an absolute must
for anyone interested in mankind's
recent history.
For the major part of his career,
Don McCullin has portrayed the
nature and the dignity of humanity
and in contrast, man's inhumanity
towards fellow men. He captures
the pain and suffering of innocent
civilians caught up in conflict,
whether in the Congo, Nigeria and
Zimbabwe or Vietnam, Cambodia
and Beirut. Particularly the portraits
of young children patiently waiting
to die from starvation will haunt me
for a long time to come.
The front-line pictures of
American Marines during the battle
of Hue have become justly
renowned. It was images such as
these which made the American
public question their role in
It was Images such as
these w h i c h m a d e the
A m e r i c a n public question
their role In V i e t n a m
Vietnam and which created what
some commentators have
described as 'a permanent dent in
the nation's collective conscience'.
More than twenty years after the
end of that war, the debate still
continues. Out of all these images
of Vietnam, one stood out. A pic-
ture of a shell-shocked US Marine.
His eyes stare lifelessly out at you,
completely devoid of thoughts or
feelings. This man has so much
horror he has gone beyond any-
thing that I could describe or even
attempt to understand.
In the eighties, McCullin turned
away from the horrors of destitu-
tion and war towards landscapes
and still life photography. This sec-
tion of the exhibition brings a wel-
come respite from the feelings of
pity, helplessness and guilt raised
by the rest of the exhibition.
Dramatic and beautiful scenes
show Nature at its best. In this
series, McCullin experiments with
light and its contrasts.
Recently, he has returned to
social documentary with a series of
photographs of religious festivals in
India and the poverty directly relat-
ed to these festivals: beggars in the
streets, people dying of leprosy on
the pavements...
When you come out of this
exhibition, you will find yourself
questioning the Western lifestyle
and wondering about the state of
its conscience. It is a truly harrow-
ing experience.
