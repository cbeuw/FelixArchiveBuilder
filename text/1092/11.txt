Thought for the day
No 1: Columbo.
You must know Columbo. Lieutenant Columbo? The man with the
dirty mac and the ever-present cigar? One of the greatest crime-fighters
of the modern televisual age. A great lateral thinker, methodical, always
polite, never defeated by even the most complex and dastardly criminal
acts. However, after hours of watching this fine man's classic and inim-
itable sleuth style, something
has struck us here at the Felix
office.
Do you ever find Columbo's
behaviour slightly strange and
off-the-wall? Let us examine
the evidence. Columbo always
turns up twenty minutes after
the rest of the police force.
Why is this? Does he perhaps ,-; w
live far away? Does he have
trouble dragging himself away
from Mrs. Columbo? You must
admit this is odd. Notice the
squint; the mumbling slurred
speech and the staggering
deliberate movements. His
great capacity for thinking not / |
just laterally but also longitudi- $^$MiKI?':t

at the same time, slightly worrying. Is he perhaps struggling against an
alcohol problem? Possibly. We have another explanation.
His interrogational technique may provide a further clue:
"Ma'am, theresh jusht one thing I just don't undershtand. How do
they get the shipsh into thosh little bottlesh? And can I have a bite of that
doughnut?"
Let's face it, Columbo smoked a lot of hashish. That was no cigar.
