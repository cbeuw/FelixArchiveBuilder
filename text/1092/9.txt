Tony Blair once said that his
project to modernise the Labour
Party would be finished when
people had learned to love Peter
Mandelson. This received a serious
setback last Monday, when a veter-
an left-winger, Ken Livingstone,
took the seat on Labour National
Executive Committee Mandelson
so desired. Mandelson had been a
prime mover behind modernisation
under Kinnock in the eighties,
becoming the MP the Hartlepool in
1992. He has had 'the ear' of
Labour leadership for over a
decade now, with the exception of
John Smith, with whom he never
got on. Mandelson's profile rose
after his election as an MP, becom-
ing the darling of the public-rela-
tions led 'New' section of the party
and simultaneously a figure of
infamy to the unreconstructed old
left.
He knows perfectly well that in
politics, the Rasputin never
becomes Czar. His ultimate goal is
a seat in the Cabinet and maybe
the leadership itself. This cannot be
obtained unless he takes himself
out of the shadows and into the
limelight. His formidable political
power is invisible and his talents
used among the 'back room' fixers.
His attempt at an NEC seat was to
justify his position in the party. "I
want to be recognised by the party
The summer infighting with
John Prescott, the Deputy Prime
Minister over who was in charge
when Blair was on holiday did

for what I am and what I do" he
said. On the night of NEC results,
Mandelson found himself in the
rare position of Labour MP of being
jeered at by his own party, delight-
ed that he had been humbled, and
by the press and news broadcast-
ers, who poked fun at him in the
same way they poked fun at the
Conservatives a few months ago.
humility that rather more politicians
could do with. Not all is lost for the
good Mr Mandelson however. His
loss with the NEC must be set with-
in the wider context of what is hap-
pening in Labour at the moment.
Widespread reform is still taking
place within the party, with its con-
sent, although there are worries
that the Conference itself is to be
emasculated. The worries
are justified, since that is
essentially what the leader-
ship are trying to do - not destroy
its role, but not to allow it to cause
a massive split in the party with the
nation watching. The Government's
policies must also be decided with
the nation rather than the
Conference shenanigans in mind.
The party voted these reforms
through happily, with even the
trade unions giving them their
grudging consent. However the
NEC elections still discarded
Mandelson for Livingstone whilst
retaining the left-wingers Diane
Abbott and Dennis Skinner. This will
send a message to the leadership,
that although they consent to
reform and change, they will not
tolerate the left's voice being muf-
fled completely. Perhaps the party
membership is more sensible than
people, including its own leader-
ship, give it credit for.

Right, now that I've finally managed to
squeeze myself into this lofty publication,
I can prepare the Culinary Revolution
which will change the world's eating habits
forever. During the year I will be writing
recipes, tips and whatever diatribes I feel
are appropriate. But first I must prepare
the subjects: you lot. So let's start with the
basics.
To make good food you need good
ingredients. This is absolutely not a prob-
lem if you're loaded, even in this country.
All you need to do is bomb it down to
Harrods in your stupidly powerful flash car
and take your pick. Or else send your PA to
pick up some just ripe papaya from wher-
ever. On the other hand you may want to
minimize your alimentary expenses so you
can spend your flash on something more
liquid. In this case you'll have to make a bit
more effort.
Supermarkets (may a thousand camels
relieve themselves in their head offices) can
be useful but only for stuff you can't get
anywhere else. In particular they are rub-
bish for fruit and veg and meat.
Unfortunately if you're into fish there isn't
an alternative as SM's have wiped out near-
ly all the independent fishmongers.

For fruit, veg and meat the answer is
simple: go to a street market. They have
the freshest produce at the cheapest prices
and there's one in most areas of London.
Here are some I particularly recommend:
North End Road
Tube: Fulham Broadway (or walk). Open
Mon - Sat. It's enormous, it has all the
usual produce plus an unbelievably cheap
cheese stall.
Portobello Road
(The northern end, not the cheesy
antiques bit near Notting Hill). Tube:
Ladbroke Road. Open Mon - Fri, with
organic stuff on Thursday. More or less a
pedestrian area and has some interesting
head shops. Plus a fantastic greasy spoon
with full breakfast for £2.95.
Ridley Road
Tube: Dalston Junction. Open Mon - Sat.
Smaller than the last two, it nonetheless
has everything you might need (including
the tastiest beetroots north of the river)
plus loads of Caribbean veg like yams and
plantains and the most evil chilies ever
(handle with care and preferably a biohaz-
ard suit as well).
II
Church Street
Tube: Edgware Road. Open Mon - Sat.
Not quite as good as the others bu,t con-
venient if you live around there.
Brixton
Tube: Brixton (turn right out of station,
under the rail bridges and right again).
Open Mon - Sat. Similar to Ridley Road
but bigger and more vibrant. A great place,
I go there just for the atmosphere.
Although most of the stalls get their
goods from the same wholesalers, there
are differences in the price and quality so
it's worthwhile checking out and compar-
ing a load of them.
After you've done the rounds of your
favourite market, you'll probably have a
few bits and pieces still missing. For cere-
als and pulses and stuff like that I go to
organic shops (because I'm like that)..
Neal's Yard in Covent Garden is pretty
good and there's also a place in
Westbourne Grove opposite the funky
loos which I recommend. Unfortunately,
all these places are overpriced but hey,
sometimes you have to splash out.
Another favourite of mine are the
shops in Chinatown (around Lisle St,
Soho) where you can find a mystifying
array of stuff from plain bean sprouts to
weird dried things that probably shouldn't
exist in this plane of reality.
