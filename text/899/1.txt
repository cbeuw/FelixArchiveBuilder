Editorial
A r o u n d 15% of the eligible voters at
Imperial actually completed at least one
paper, as opposed to over 19% last year.
Yet in a recent survey conducted by
members of the Felix staff over 8 0 % of
students questioned expressed negative
views towards the Union.
So, they're over. The whole sabbatical
election caboodle is finished. Writing an
editorial is all about giving m y view on a
subject. So here goes...
It sucks. Fifteen percent of y o u voted. If
someone came up to you and asked y o u
what you thought of the U n i o n , what
would you say? I k n o w from actually
asking people that very few would say 'It
does a storming job', or something along
those lines. Nearly everybody at this
college complains about the Union: 'It
doesn't do enough'. 'I think it's a load of
rubbish..'. 'What do they do?'. 'It doesn't
involve enough students'. 'Who are they
and what do they do?'. 'It's shit... it's
uncaring and doesn't have the students
interests at heart'.
These are actual quotes from students
here, ie Y O U . Yet, if you feel this way,
ask yourself: D i d you read the
manifestoes in Felix? D i d y o u bother to
look at the candidates posters? D i d y o u
bother to read their hand-outs? D i d you
bother to go along to the Hustings? D i d
y o u bother to vote? In short, did y o u
bother?
Each of those would have taken
between thirty seconds and ten minutes
of your time. H o w many of you can say
yes to more than half? Judging by the
voting figures, I'd say more than 8 5 % of
you didn't. Y o u didn't bother. But of
those 8 5 % , how many of y o u would
complain if someone asked y o u about the
Union? Be honest. Y o u don't have to tell
anybody, just ask yourself. Then, next
time you feel like complaining about the
Union, whether to a friend or to Felix,
ask yourself if you voted. A s k yourself if
y o u tried to do anything. A s k yourself if
y o u got involved. Ask yourself if you
bothered.
