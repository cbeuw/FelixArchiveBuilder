would necessitate an expansion of first year laboratory facilities.
Finally, and perhaps most significantly, he feels that there is a
probable use ol some areas as a "post experience centre''. This facility
would consist of a number of small conference rooms (and fairly
luxurious accommodation ) w h i c h w o u l d be hired out to senior
managers in industry a t t e n d i n g short courses to improve their
knowledge and use of modern technology.
M r Smith assured F E L I X that the present U n i o n Bar and L o w e r
Lounge would remain as student areas (and perhaps even some other
parts of the building). W h e n asked about possible sources of finance in
the face of the current economi^ situation he felt that an optimistic
approach was needed and thought that il the idea was given approval
the College could find the money necessary.
T h e move would take place over a two year period beginning in. J u l y
1983 at the earliest, and would hence need to be included in the
College budget for 1983/4. This would mean that the student union
would have to show considerable interest before next October andl
w o u l d need to approve more detailed plans by J a n u a r y 1983.
M o n d a y ' s I C U C o u n c i l instructed the Executive to investigate the
matter further and the summer months will undoubtably prove vital as
further details emerge.
It seems likely that a College-wide ballot may be called for as a
measure ol" approval.
Sick Bay takes students to
the cleaners
I C U C o u n c i l mandated future U n i o n Executives to "discuss further on
the proposed move to .Southside and report hack" (to Council) at a
meeting last M o n d a y .
Although the majority of C o u n c i l did not share Nick Morton's
enthusiasm lor the proposed move (see front page), they requested
more detailed proposals before making a final decision.
Similar motions were also passed on the future financing of the
Health Centre sickbay and a central laundry facility available to all
students. However, it was pointed out that in the event of I C students
having to make a compulsory £\0 payment for the sickbay, R o y a l
College of M u s i c students, who also use the sickbay, would be required
to pay also.
T h e meeting approved the conversion of the U n i o n L o w e r Lounge
into a refectory-type area with bar and the conversion should be.
completed during the summer. Most of the work will be financed by
College although the U n i o n will have to pay for the modification of the
current kitchen to the Ents R o o m .
Miss Christine Teller was also ratified as acting Deputy President
and the addition of her name to the D P Honours Board and Pot
authorised.
T h e meeting remained quorate until it was closed, thus allowing
matters from as long ago as 1980 lo be noted.

More rent increases
T h e following recommendations for next year's rent levels will be put
to the Rector from Student Residence Committee.
Rooms Currently Weekly Rent Proposed rent for 1982/3
Singles in Weeks, Linstead, Southside
Singles in Montpelier
Singles in New Beit
Singles in O l d Beit, Garden, Evelyn Gdns
Doubles in Linstead
Doubles in Montpelier
Doubles in Beit. Garden, Evelyn Gdns
Triples in Garden, Evelyn Gdns
T h e following points should be noted:
1. £13,000 expenditure on building insurance has been transferred
from the College central account to the Student Residence Account.
2. R e d e c o r a t i o n a n d r e f u r n i s h m e n t p r o g r a m m e s have been
reinstated after severe cutbacks due to financial problems this year.
3. T h e Wardens entertainments allowance is to be reinstated.
4. A l l o w i n g for extra expenditure in points 1-3, the increase in rents
for 1982/3 has been held to a reasonable level. T h i s has been possible
thanks to savings on the linen service and heating and probable
stabilisation of interest rates.
A few other matters of interest were discussed at Students Residence
Committee:
A . A l t h o u g h S R C will continue with its own plans to upgrade
laundry facilities in Halls and Houses, the College centrally is looking
into the provision of a central communal laundry lor all. T h e U n i o n
President will pursue this matter.
B. A voluntary linen hire scheme will be run in the Halls and
Houses next year. Four sheets and four pillowcases may be hired by
students at a rate of £A per a n n u m with a £\0 deposit.
C. The residents of Montpelier Street are to he given a rebate of one
week's rent for inconvenience caused by work on the dry rot. This work
may continue until mid-August and includes exploratory work to
check other timbers are not infected. The planned programme of work
has been agreed with the residents themselves.
D. Rents for H e a d Tenancies for 1982/3 have not been finally
negotiated with the landlords.
E. Negotiations for a new H e a d Tenancy with 140 places are in
progress at present.
F. D r D o n M o n r o is retiring and is not to be replaced. H e will
remain C h a i r m a n of the Students Residence Committee lor 1982/3.
