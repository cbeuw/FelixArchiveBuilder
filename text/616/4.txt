It is true that in his time at
Imperial D r James has rested

political water lillics, but he
has never been slow to leap
when he fell that his many
talents could liest be employed
elsewhere.
What could motivate me to
write so unashamedly of the
virtues ol D r James? Certainly
we once took sherry on the
beach at St L u c a r de Barra-
meidos together, but is is not
out of mere personal friend-
ship that I write. N o , since
t h a t t i m e the p a t h of a
humble engineering student
has not included that most
excellent ivory tower that is
the Department ol History of
S c i e n c e a n d T e c h n o l o g y .
Surely this is the key to the
great enigma that surrounds
D r James, that whilst engi-

person ol D r Frank James
continue to grace our most
honoured college.

W i t h r e f e r e n c e to last

that Weeks H a l l residents will
no longer be able to pursue in

refrain from pursuing these
self-same activities in public it
would leave both your hands

Dear Mark
It is far too easy for old
windbags like R . S . Alexander
and M . Foot to rant and rave
about the cost involved in
launching the Task Force and
how else the money might
have been spent. B u t the
argument in this issue is moral
a n d not monetarist. If we
w e r e , as R . S . A l e x a n d e r
s u g g e s t s , to r e w a r d t h e
A r g e n t i n i a n aggression by
h a n d i n g over the I s l a n d s
without a light then where
w i l l it end? W h e r e next:
Gibraltar? Belize.
The rest of the world is
looking to Britain to set an
example and put the aggres-
s o r f i r m l y i n h i s p l a c e .
Alright, maybe the Islands
are one of the last embar-
rassing outposts of Empire hid
remember this, these people
are British citizens and we
cannot and must not desert
them in their hour of need.
R . S . Alexander points out the
j u n t a ' s r e c o r d on h u m a n
rights—surely this is reason
enough for going to the aid of
our people?
T h e r e is no c o m p a r i s o n
between our military action
and that of Argentina. We are
acting in self-defence and we
have the backing of the U N ,
t h e E E C a n d t h e U S A .
However, since all the diplo-
matic efforts have failed it is
inevitable that lives will be
lost. But then that's war.
When the lighting rcallys
starts there will be no room
lor the Bennitcs among us
telling us not to kill the Argies
because they certainly won't
be showing us any mercy.
Y o u don't like the sound of it,
do you M r Alexander? Well,
if you don't like being British
then why don't you bugger oil
to Argentina and join Leopold
in his bunker? Perhaps then
vou'll realise that he's not the
nice guy you thought he was.

Dear Mark
Perusing through F E L I X
last week I i n a d v e r t e n t l y
stumbled across a piece of
moronic diatribe by somebody
called R . S . Alexander. Now,
while I don't want to ruin the
poor chap's wonderful article
on the Falkland's Crisis, I
should just like to point out to
him a few home truths.
Firstly the Falklands are
British. Does he know what
that means? It means that
they are of the same blood as
thee and me (and presumably
him). D i d his blood not boil
when he heard that a few
thousand uniformed Gauchos
had stomped rudely into their
life, their thoroughly British
life, and had ordered them to
get out or act like an Argen-
tinian? A blatant attempt had
been made by the "pawns in
the p o w e r s t r a t e g y of a
contemptible fascist regime"
(as he put it) to totally convert
the lifestyle of the h a r d y
islanders on this anachronistic
r e m n a n t of bygone British
i m p e r i a l i s m — both phrases
straight from his well-worn
c o p y of the " L i t t l e Boys
Bedside Book of Bennisms for
Beginners" no doubt.
Secondly our government
are not wasting exaggerated
sums of money on this venture.
There happens to be a con-
siderable amount of what is
called "contingency money"
available which was set aside
lor just this purpose donkey's
years ago.
T h i r d l y I don't c a l l six
weeks of laborious diplomatic-
pursuit of peace "intransi-
g e n c e " . M a y b e o l d R . S .
would have liked to have seen
overwhelming apathy about
the affair. I suppose that way
nobody would be killed. But,
let's fact it, if the average
British trooper was told now
that the g o v e r n m e n t was
bringing him home because it
was c o n c e r n e d a b o u t his
safety, thanks would be the
last thing he would proffer. I
t h i n k t h a t " e m o t i o n l e s s
zombies" (oh, most pictorial
R.S.. most pictorial) in the
government happen to have
the backbone to realise that
B r i t i s h people — and inter-
national law don't forget—
are worth fighting for. Yes,
and dving for. It's called guts.
R.S.
F o u r t h l y . I don't really
think anybody can describe
the role of the Task Force as a
mere " n a t i o n a l exercise".
The retaking of South Georgia
without loss of life and the
landing of British troops on
the Falklands recently were
both deeds of sheer profes-
sionalism; enough to make
any British chest swell with
pride.
Fifthly (and I must admit
rather pettily) R . S . is wrong
to say that the government's
course of action "puts them in
a comparable league as the
Argentinian junta"; on two
counts. O n e , because he's
writing tripe again and two,
because one normally com-
pares things 'with' or 'two'
rather than 'as'. M i n d you,
t r a n s l a t i n g B e n n i t e d r i v e l
isn't easy.
Lastly, let me remind him
of that splendid mother who
appeared on T V with a brave
lace just 24 hours alter her son
h a d been k i l l e d on H M S
Sheflield and urged Britian to
back the Falklanders. Prats
like ' R . S . I can't remember
my department or year Alex-
ander' can gripe and wimp
a w a y a l l t h e y l i k e . T h e
Falklanders won't want to
know.

Mr
In reply to R.S. Alexander's
a n t i - g o v e r n m e n t , a n t i -
F a l k l a n d Islands and pro-
Argentine letter ol last week
( F E L I X 615), I note the
following:
The Falklands were invaded
and o c c u p i e d about seven
weeks ago. The United N a -
tions passed Resolution 502
which told the Argentines to
get out. This was ignored.
A r t i c l e 51 of the U n i t e d
Nations Charter allows for
self-defence w h e n i n v a d e d ,
which is why the Task Force
was sent.
R.S. Alexander prefers a
"sensible and peaceful solu-
tion" probably running along
the lines of the Task Force
withdrawing, the Falklands
being ceded to the Argentines
and the wishes of the Islanders
being ignored totally (com-
monly known as sell-out). H e
also suggests that the Islanders
"should be given the chance
of e v a c u a t i o n " w h i c h w i l l
probably end up as lorceable
