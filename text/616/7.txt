time in persuing more clandestine political
activity. More repressive measures followed
w h i c h a t t e m p t e d to c o n t a i n the growing
activity. A feeling of frustration and impatience
led the group to consider taking the life of the
Tsar. The group split over this question but a
section succeeded in 1881 at their eighth
attempt to kill the Tsar. Six of the group were
later executed.
Although an entertaining piece of narrative
drama, the play's pace is furious. One has to
hang onto one's seat very tightly as one is
whisked past the various moral and political
questions of revolutionary activity which the
play purports to examine. One has no time to
reflect on these issues and other interesting
facets of pre-revolution Russia such as the
incongruity of rich, intellectual rev. iu'.ionaries
attempting to mingle w'.l. the peasants, the
squeezing out of "be Russia:; G o d from the
progressive idv.°r- rtussia's lack of an identity
or a c o m m o n p e o p l e a n d its c u l t u r a l
dependence on the West.
The Execution is a c o n t r i b u t i o n to the
feminist " W o m e n L i v e " e v e n t s that are
currently taking place and its subject matter
obviously m a k e s a g o o d c h o i c e with its
portrayal of exemplary, determined young
women intent on constructing a more just and
humane society. However this is not the play's
strongest message, and although it is the sort
of play that induces different responses or
impressions in members of the audience, its
lasting impression was of the sad sight of
intelligent and calculating individuals resorting
to desperate almost m a d efforts t h r o u g h
frustration and impatience in not seeing the
fruits of their l a b o u r s . R e v o l u t i o n s don't
happen overnight and the characters required
of revolutionaries who desire to usher in a
m o r e c i v i l i s e d s o c i e t y after d e c a d e s or
centuries of habit and conditioning is one of
almost super-human patience.

IC C h o i r m e m b e r s ' persistence in selling
tickets resulted in quite a good audience for
their performance of Bach's St. John Passion
on M a y 21, but pressure of exams or fear of
Pigotts (a weekend in the country to learn the
work) had reduced the size of the choir itself
considerably from that which performed the
Verdi Requiem before Easter.
Both choir and orchestra made a firm start
on the opening chorus. The altos immediately
made it obvious that they lacked both the clear
tone of the sopranos and the courage of the
tenors who, despite numbering only 10 (less
than half the alto population), sang with
conviction and worked hard to balance ihe
larger numbers of sopranos and basses. The
soprano tone did deteriorate somewhat in the
second half when one or two voices, audible
above the rest of the choir, became rather
screeching — notably at the shouts of'Crucify
Him'. The basses were as reliable as ever but
lacked some weight in the lower register.
In general the choir sang the chorales well
with a controlled balanced sound. The more
v i g o r o u s c h o r u s e s were a t t a c k e d w i t h
competence although those requiring more
agile voices were marred by a great surge of
relief in the closing bars.
The orchestra showed some disagreement
amongst the strings as to which ascending
scale should begin one particular aria but
produced some lovely woodwind solos. A fine
continuo was played on harpsichord cello and
organ.
The most outstanding solo performance was
given by Penelope W a l k e r (contralto) in
Tennis
Kings College vs IC
'Chains of Bondage' beautifully accompanied
by an oboe duet. During the bass aria 'Haste
poor souls' it was debatable whether it was the
soloist William Schimmel, or the choir who
was performing at short notice — the choir's
intermittent ' O h where?' sounding like mass
heavy breathing. U n f o r t u n a t e l y the tenor
soloist Lawrence Dale obviously thought that
the conductor Eric Brown knew the answer to
'Ah my soul, what end awaiteth thee?' as he
d i r e c t e d the whole of this aria (and his
subsequent solos) towards h i m . A clear
expressive recitative was sung by Andrew
King as the Evangelist. Christus was sung by
J o n a t h a n Best and the s o p r a n o solo by
Jennifer Adams.

A c o n c e r t g i r e n by the Imperial College
Symphony Orchestra in the Great Hall,
Imperial College. May 19, 1982.
Your reviewer, after getting back from a
particularly shattering day. was sitting quietly
waiting for the concert to begin when a very
beautiful red headed timpanist bounced up to
ask if I could review the concert for F E L I X ;
never having been known to refuse a lady
anything 1 agreed.
The conceit began with Berlioz's Roman
Carnival Overture which is a highly complex
ballet than quick bowling, and croquet is not
that energetic. O K , so you f l u k e d two
crickets but this was a limited overs game and
you cannot bowl three long hops an over
down the leg side. Y o u blew it. Y o u lost IC
the game. I agree Bussey was also hit all
around the park but you must take most ol
the responsibility yourself. Don't take it to
heart, Bill old man. Croquet can be thrilling,
you know."
H i m n r r s skulked into a corner where he
found Bussey reflecting on being hit for six
over long-off' and White contemplating how
he once enjoyed a game of cricket. But that
piece of orchestration and is well suited to the
talents of I C S O who gave it a splendid
rendering. The piano concerto no. 23 K488 by
Mozart followed next and illustrates further, if
such illustration was required, the value of
music making in this College as it allows
talented musicians an opportunity to display
their virtuosity which they might not otherwise
have. The musician in this case was Damian
Wisniewski who gave a superb rendering of
the concerto both in delicacy in playing and in
his sensitive interpretation. This latter was in a
very romantic mode and shows that one does
not have to r e t u r n to 'how it must have
sounded to Mozart' in order to produce a
beautiful effect. It only requires for it to be
played with sympathy and understanding for
s u c h an effect to be p r o d u c e d . M y only
adverse criticism of this piece was that the
w o o d w i n d players sometimes let the side
down.
Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony provided a full
outlet for the energetic conducting style of
Richard Dickins (dressed in a white dinner
jacket). He controlled the orchestra through
s o m e very difficult pieces especially the
pizzicato. Special reference must be made to
the b r a s s s e c t i o n a n d the t r u m p e t s in
particular who played exactly what was
required; can there be higher praise?
Altogether it was a most enjoyable evening
and I left feeling a lot less shattered than when I
arrived.

H a v i n g arrived at Enfield T C , in Dave
Gladman's custom converted excort, the I C
team a n d the Steve W i l l i s a p j i r e c i a t i o n
society had to squeeze back inside as their
courts were too wet to play on. There was a
change of venue which obviously disturbed
the IC side. G l a d m a n and M . Shepherd
seemed to regard the first match as a w a r m -
up and lost 6-0, 6-3 whereas Willis and Phil
(not shot) Shepherd managed to take their
match to three sets, but lost 2-1.
In the second matches S h e p h e r d a n d
G l a d m a n turned on the form and won 7-6, 4-
6, 6-1. However, the other match was left
unfinished at one set each 6-6. in pouring
rain, howling wind and darkness at 9:30pm.
Special mention to M . Shepherd's hairless
but shapely legs which gave him extra speed
owing to reduced wind resistance.
Cricket
Enfield Chase vs IC
Himners was desperate for advice alter this
match and a wise old cricketer offered h i m
the following:
" W e l l Bill, il I were you. I would take up
croquet. I mean they do play that sort of
thing in Zimbabwe where you come from,
don't they? Alter watching you bowl today, I
really feel it is not worth your while carrying
on. Alter all. vour bodv is built more lor
was three years ago and he hasn't smiled
since.
Incidentally, we were thrashed. A l l the
front line batsmen failed again, led by a
stylish golden duck from Simpkin. This really
is becoming a habit of his. We slumped lo 66
for 6 before M o r t o n (45, and Bussey 21 no
made the score respectable. O u r 40 over*
were completed with us on 143 for 8.
A n d then Himners bowled and you can
guess the rest. K i n g s won by six wickets with
many overs to spare. Follow the advice of-a
wise old cricketer. Bill — take up (roquet!
