R . S . Alexander lives but I am
sure he will be quite happy to
o b l i g e w h e n the Z a m b i a n
A r m y move in, erect their flag
and have him and his family
evacuated with the loss of
their home and possessions as
he suggests. A f t e r a l l , the
Zambians are "the rightful
owners" (tribesmen camped
there 3 2 7 B C ) . H e fails to
realise that a sell-out on the
Falklands will give licence to
S p a i n i n v a d i n g G i b r a l t e r
(after the W o r l d Cup!), C u b a
invading the C a y m a n Islands,
Guatemala invading Belize
a n d F r a n c e i n v a d i n g the
Channel Islands and Isle ol
Wight. A l l of these are under
British soveriegnity and wish
to r e m a i n so, as do the
Falkland Islanders. But then,
the wishes of the residents are
quite irrelevant according to
R . S . Alexander.
I also note several rabid
anti-government paragraphs.
But when the alternatives to
this government arc Foot and
Bcnn — the flower pot men,
or wishy washy Woy Jenkins,
then Margaret Thatcher is
infinitely preferable.

ander makes out. They pro-
bably saw through all the
propaganda in his letter as I
did.

Hello, good morning and welcome; there, that's got the corny bit over
for this week, now down to business. You've probably noticed by now,
despite Argentina's best efforts to provide alternative entertainment,
that IC is beset by an annual disease called examitis. It is characterised
by students blowing dust off their textbooks, exhuming problem sheets
and asking one another where the library is. A tonic which can bring
partial relief is available free to residents of Southside and Linstead, and
even some people in Bernard Sunley House: the remarkable properties
of IC Radio include the relaxation of your brain cell(s) and even calming
your stomach after a hastily-consumed moonie (I would say "eaten", but
that would imply that food was imbibed). Yes, IC Radio continues
through the crisis period with the Breakfast Show every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday, and programmes to make your revision a little
bit easier each weekday evening, starting at 6:00pm; and, of course,
lunchtime programmes to the J C R on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

T h e M o d e l A i r c r a f t C l u b is
organising a tour of France for ten
days from July 24 to August 2. We
plan to visit a lot of slope soaring
sites, stun the locals with our
wonderous flying ability, acquire
absurd froggy accents and gener-
ally live off the fat of the land a bit.
There are a couple of vacant
seats in the van so if you like the
s o u n d of this w h e e z e please
contact me. I know there are lots
of people in College who fly model
airplaines only during the holidays
and therefore have not joined
I C M A C . If you are one of these
and you would like to come we
could easily join you up. It would
also be an ideal way for a novice to
learn to fly even if you don't have
your own equipment. The club
has just bought a new radio and
we have a s u i t a b l e glider for
training.
The cost of transport for the
trip will be about £50 each.
If you are interested in this (or
just want to come flying at the
weekend) please contact: Nick

happened, just the odd item of
mindless vandalism to our lights,
we hope the culprits have multiple
pneumothoraxes. The cue-tipping
situation is not helped by people
mistreating the cues. W e are
losing our best. Apologies to all
decent honest members.
Right, moans over, onto brighter

Chaplaincy
Barrel Organ Aids Christian A i d
Every year groups of students
take to the streets in the first week
of May to follow the barrel organ
which is stricken with an annual
attack of wanderlust in Christian
Aid Week. This year our nomadic
friend has been heard in venues
from the N a t i o n a l T h e a t r e to
Portobello Market, from Chiswick
High Street to Piccadilly Circus,
and in further widening his (her?)
experience has joined the soup
r u n , t r a v e r s e d the H u n g e r f o r d
Bridge at high speed, and visited
the Leicester Square "Superloo".
Such a VIP is bound to attract
attention from the public; his
innards were nearly brought up on
t w o o c c a s i o n s by the s a m e
busker; he was offered a recording
contract by a deranged gentleman
from 'Radio Recording Services'
and in the latter part of the week
he was accompanied by a large
gorilla who was c o n t r a c t e d to
approach small children with a
collecting tin. T h e majority of
children decided it couldn't be a
real gorilla because it was too fat
and had spots. A great deal of fun
was had by all, including I hope,
the people who contributed £860
to Christian Aid on the street and
through the envelope collection in
Halls.
