Dear Mark
As usual, there are a whole
bunch of points in the last
issue of F E L I X which deserve
comment, but the pompous
r a m b l i n g s o f t h a t s e l f -
opinionated ass M o r t o n really
clinch it. H e obviously appre-
ciates t h a t i n f o r m a t i o n is
power, a n d appears to be
c l i n g i n g t i g h t l y to b o t h -
come on D a d d y N i c h o l a s ,
what is Morton's Mystery?
W i t h his total lack of action,
and his neglecting to inform
us of plans to close the U n i o n
r e f e c t o r y a n d waste m o r e
money on the Lower Lounge,
it's hardly surprising there's
such disinterest in the Union.
There is precious little to be
interested in.
O u r illustrious President's
report is chock-a-block with
the wonderful things he has
done for us. I would just like
to add that the high-sounding
threeway negotiation over the
games machines involved a
s i n g l e p h o n e - c a l l , w h e n I
carried out the same task for
T i z a r d H a l l two years ago. O f
course it's quite possible that
the U n i o n bureaucracy could
make this twice as compli-
cated as necessary, as they do
w i t h the c l u b t r a n s p o r t
subsidies.
I'm glad to hear M a r c o had
such a lovely time in Sweden,
and of course an international
viewpoint and perspective is
i m p o r t a n t a n d u s e f u l to
everyone. Unfortunately, if
the rest of us only get to learn
that there were discussions on
"technical development with
specific reference t o . . . t h e
effects on society both positive
and negative", perhaps the
£200 was not w e l l - s p e n t .
Some specific i n f o r m a t i o n
would be a better justification
for the trip than the news that
M a r c o made a load of pals
and didn't want to come back
to London.
Finally, I appreciate that
w i t h the p e r i l of e x a m s
approaching, first years are
inclined to let their minds
wander to the meaning oflile,
as their past experiences Hash
before their eyes. Next time
some boring muddled bttrk
like T i m Larcombe writes a
logically incoherent soapbox
article, I would neverthless be
grateful if you would just Hush
it d o w n t h e a p p r o p r i a t e
receptacle.
Thanks lor a year's interest-
ing reading.

Dear Mark
I was fascinated by your
insight into Nick Morton's
depth of knowledge of student
opinions expressed in your
e d i t o r i a l last w e e k . Y o u
omitted to mention his es-
capades involving residence.
H e himself admits (in his
annual report) that he has
made himself unpopular on
this subject, a comment which
is more true than many that
he has made. O u r illustrious
President's major folly in this
area has been the affair of the
linen service. H e started out
with a supposedly wonderful
i d e a t h a t he c o u l d save
students a lot of money by
scrapping this useful feature
of H a l l life. H e commissioned
a costing of it, which indi-
cated that students pay about
£1 per week to have their
sheets and pillowcases washed,
ironed and delivered to their
room. A h a ! H e could save all
the poor students about £30
per year! But what could one
r e p l a c e the service w i t h ?
Another M o r t o n brainstorm
occurs (not unlike a thunder-
storm only much more dan-
gerous) — a 'central' laundry
facility could be introduced in
the basement ol Garden Hall,
equipped with the machines
from all the Halls' laundries.
N o w Garden H a l l has many
fewer residents than either
Southside or Linstead, so I
can only conclude that this is
a new use of the word 'central'
that I had not previously been
aware of.
T h e last I heard, there had
been no costing of the new
laundry, which will certainly
be very expensive, or any
i n d i c a t i o n of w h e r e the
capital will come from. W h e n
a s k e d a b o u t p a y m e n t ol
r u n n i n g costs ( c u r r e n t l y
subsidised from H a l l funds),
N i c k " p r o p o s e d c h a r g i n g
' ' s e m i - c o m m e r c i a l " rates,
"sav 50p per wash" instead ol
2()p. One should also note
that if students have to wash
sheets as well, it is likely to
take two loads coasting £\;
the savings to students are
beginning to diminish. Other
supposed advantages of the
proposed scheme include the
w a y t h a t S o u t h s i d e a n d
Linstead residents will have to
walk across the gardens to do
their washing and that there
will be no security, so people
will have to sit and watch
their washing, rather than
returning to their rooms to
work, etc.
Morton's folly must have
other points to commend it,
like the subtle aroma which
w i l l c o m e f r o m r o o m s ol
students who can't be both-
ered to wash their sheets, and
of course the minimal amount
ol each student's money easily
outweighs the extra incon-
venience and time wasted;
doesn't it? The withdrawal of
the linen service is apparently
dependent upon the provision
of the new laundry; however,
k n o w i n g h o w fast Estates
work, I very much doubt that
this could be achieved before
the end of September.
The most interesting aspect
of the whole affair is Nick's
concern about student opin-
ions. H e was totally n o n -
plussed by a petition from
nearly a third of the residents
of Southside asking for the
present service to be retained,
because M o r t o n knows better
than the students he purports
to serve.

Dear Mark
We note that from F E L I X
G15 that certain sexual frus-
trations have become appar-
ent in Weeks Hall. We also
note with pleasure that you
have reported the speed with
which the U n i o n is rectifying
this situation by provision of
b r o t h e l f a c i l i t i e s i n the
Southside Bar.
The U n i o n has been active-
ly investigating sex in this
College. Indeed, the Honor-
ary Secretary has only recently
returned from a highly success-
ful fact-finding tour of Sweden.
The success of his research is
clearly demonstrated by his
complete lack of energy since
arriving back in England. W c
will probably ask P W P lo
carry out a further in-depth
analysis ol the affair before we
disband them (bilaterally!).
Clearly, we must act quickly
to eradicate sexual deviancy
amongst IC students. This
reached new heights when
activities involving three post-
graduates, a bunk-bed and an
oversized micrometer led to
the collapse of a floor at 14
Montpelier Street.
Finally, there is no truth in
the r u m o u r that a special
Sports D a y m e d a l w i l l be
awarded for sexual prowess at
the A G M to J . M a r t i n Taylor
(or was it M a r t i n S. Taylor?).
Bilaterally yours
Nick and Christine
PS: We are not against sex in
principle.
Sir
It is with increasing dismay
that I read in your columns
the thoughts of those who
seem to belittle the contribu-
tion to College life made by
that most eminent a m o n g
y o u r c o r r c s p o n d e n t s , D r
F r a n k J a m e s . T h e y surely
cannot realise that D r James'
writings are those of the most
consistently perceptive and
informed persons currently in
College.
In my first year D r James
got the new term off to a
splendid start by describing in
F E L I X those i n v o l v e d in
constituent college unions as
" l a t e n t h o m o s e x u a l beer-
s w i l l i n g l o u t s " , a c r i t i c i s m
that was at the time wholly
justified, and which has since
had a considerable effect.
This is the man that we are
really here considering, one
who is genuinely more con-
cerned for the welfare of his
chosen College than his own
p o p u l a r i t y or s a b b a t i c a l
credibility. In the same year
D r James, in his indisputed
r o l e as the closest t h i n g
