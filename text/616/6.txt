Missing Cert AA Directed by Costa-
Gavras Now showing Empire 2, ABC
Fulham Rd.
O n September 16, 1973, at the height of the
military coup which overthrew the government
of D r Salvador Allende in Chile, American
w r i t e r C h a r l e s H o r m a n ( J o h n Shea) dis-
appaared from his home in Santiago. This is
undisputed fact.
The film traces the events following the
arrival of his father Edmund H o r m a n (Jack
L e m m o n ) i n S a n t i a g o t o investigate the
disappearnce. It culminates in the revelation
that the American government was implicated
in the overthrow of the Chilean government
and the subsequent disappearance of Charles
H o r m a n because he knew too much. This is
presented as fact, but is hotly disputed by the
U S State Department.
Edmund H o r m a n sued Henry Kissinger and
numerous other top U S officials but to no
avail.
The film was clandestinely filmed in Mexico
City, looking not unlike Santiago, with startling
realism. Chilean troops were shown every bit
as menacing as when this writer had the good
fortune to find himself in Santiago i n more
stable times last year. This, coupled with
Lemmon's brilliant performance a? Edmund
Horman, showing him to be a m a n of deep
d e t e r m i n a t i o n , a n d a s u p p o r t e r of t h e
"American W a y " whose great confidence in
government officials fades rapidly as he begins
to see through their glossy, compassionate
facade, makes Missing one of the best serious
films this year. It was America's entry to the
Cannes Film Festival which must be a blow to
the U S S t a t e D e p a r t m e n t , w h o i n their
determined efforts to find the truth, have
p r o d u c e d a three page denial of events
portrayed in the film in order that the public
may be correctly informed.
It is deliberate that I have not said if Charles
H o r m a n was eventually found or not. If you
don't already know the whole story then it is
better to avoid other reviews and to see the
film, as I. did, experiencing the same sense of
uncertainty that Edmund H o r m a n and his
daughter-in-law (Sissy Spacek) must have
gone through in their search for Charles in the
face of total adversity. This, together with the
remarkable realism, is the backbone of this
excellent film.

BRITANNIA HOSPITAL
Britannia Hospital Certificate AA
Directed by Lindsay Anderson Starring
Leonard Rossiter, Graham Crowden,
Malcolm McDowell Now showing ABC
Shaftesbury Avenue, Fulham Road.
Britannia Hospital is in trouble. Pickets stop
all but the most urgent admissions and the
Unions halt cooked breakfasts to the private
w i n g . H o s p i t a l a d m i n i s t r a t o r M r P o t t e r
(Leonard Rossiter) has to prepare for a royal
visitor, under instruction from a dwarf and a
t r a n s v e s t i t e , a n d a m a n i a c a l p r o f e s s o r
prepares to reveal his ultimate creation to the
world.
These are some of the scanty elements
which go to produce Lindsay Anderson's latest
black comedy, which makes an odd trilogy out
of // and O Lucky Man. Having seen these
films y o u w o u l d e x p e c t a s t r a n g e a n d
h u m o r o u s l o o k at B r i t i s h life f r o m t h e
inside—you certainly won't be disappointed.
A n d e r s o n d r a w s many c h a r a c t e r s (and
actors) from his previous two films including
Mick Travis (the rebel schoolboy from If and
ambitious coffee salesman from 0 Lucky Man)
played by Malcolm McDowell and Professor
Millar (Graham Crowden) who develops as a
brilliantly funny mam character. The Millar
Centre is due to be opened by " H R H " so the
professor, like a modern Frankenstein, pushes
back the frontiers of science with scant regard
for human feelings to please his royal guest.
The film has many targets: the trade unions,
modern technology, royalty, the police force,
a n d t h e m e d i a — i n f a c t , m o s t B r i t i s h
institutions. It is for this reason that quite a stir
was caused when it was chosen as one of
Britain's entries in the Cannes Film Festival.
The sick jokes and dark humour may not
make it popular with the establishment, but it
displays all the qualities of British humour at its
best: cutting, introspective and well performed.
Although the film is episodic (which makes it
almost impossible to advertise well) continuity
is just about maintained as it races towards a
moving climax.
By its very nature this is a film which will
divide the audience and the critics. But you
shouldn't really miss the chance to see what is
undoubtably a major British comedy.

The Execution by Melissa Murray.
Presented by Monstrous Regiment and
directed by Sue Dunderdale. Institute of
Contemporary Arts, The Mall.
The Execution, a play in the style Of a
political, historical epic, follows the true story
of the w o m e n b e h i n d the killing of T s a r
A l e x a n d e r II, H o l y F a t h e r of A l l R u s s i a .
Alexander II came to the throne in 1855 and
proclaimed a programme of social reforms,
relaxation of censorship, improvements in the
e d u c a t i o n a l s y s t e m , t r i a l b y j u r y a n d
emancipation of the serfs. But the promised
'revolution from above' failed to materialise.
During these times, higher education was
v i r t u a l l y u n o b t a i n a b l e f o r w o m e n i n s i d e
Russia. Those who could afford to, and who
could escape their families, went to universities
in France, Germany and Switzerland, where
they also gained a grounding in political theory
and philosophy, much of it from the writings of
emigre Russian revolutionaries.
The play follows the lives of a small group of
w o m e n from the time of a n edict w h i c h
ordered the return of all women students to
Russia on the grounds that they were leading
dissolute a n d i m m o r a l lives. T h e w o m e n
returned, not merely in obedience to the Tsar,
but to begin their active political lives. They
began by merging with the common folk,
a d o p t i n g peasant clothes a n d living a n d
working in the countryside. T h e government
interpreted the movement as an attempted
revolution and had most of them arrested.
However they were soon freed and lost no
