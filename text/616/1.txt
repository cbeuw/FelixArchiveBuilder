UNION BUILDING TO CLOSE ?
Southside bargain basement
offered b y College
Editorial
T h e possible motives for agreeing to move the student
union facilities to the Southside Halls basement are not
immediately obvious to me. We should all look very closely
at these proposals and decide whether we are really getting
a "good deal", as the College claims.
At a first impression I don't think we are, although we
should all be willing to listen to arguments to the contrary.
T h e immediate advantages are: firstly, the possibility of
i n c r e a s e d s p a c e (with new facilities) a n d s e c o n d l y ,
improved use of the Union by Southside residents.
But the great danger is that we will end up exchanging the
current Union Building for a converted aircraft hanger (the
main refectory) and a dinghy basement. We would also be
breaking links with the tradition of many years and the
move would certainly result in great changes for those
pieces of the Union Building we retain (and possibly also
alienate former Union members).
T h e r e are s e v e r a l q u e s t i o n s w h i c h r e m a i n to be
answered. How can we be certain that the facilities in
Southside would be an improvement on what we have
already? Why is the College willing to spend such large
amounts of money to move us? How will the Union Building
be used and could these things be done elsewhere?
Until all these points and many others can be cleared up
completely it is perhaps unwise to discard the idea out of
hand. But I feel that we should tread very carefully,
especially considering the I C U President Nick Morton
thinks it is " a cracking good idea" and may well continue
with these plans without telling us.
S o far he has taken the staggering attitude of "Nanny
knows best'' and has discussed these proposals without any
reference to student opinion. Now that the plans are
known, we should be given all the details and be allowed to
make the decision for ourselves.
A surprise plan to move the Student Union to the basement of
the Southside Halls of Residence was revealed by ICU
President Mr Nick Morton last Friday. The plan would involve
abandoning the current Union Building for use by the College
and could cost in excess of Â£250,000.
College Secretary M r J o h n Smith suggested the idea to the President
in M a r c h and it was only last week tht the first plans were completed
by the Estates Department. F o r this reason M r M o r t o n decided not to
inform I C U Council until M o n d a y or include the plans in Exec News
for last Tuesday's A G M .
The proposals are, at present, in the very early stages of preparation
and would need to be generally approved before any large amount of
money was committed to further investigation. J o h n Smith told
F E L I X that there was no intention of " p u l l i n g offa coup" and that the
idea had only been revealed to assess the level of support.
M r Smith commented that he had been concerned with the lack of
use of the lower three levels of Southside, following the closure of most
of the Refectory facilities there. This, he said, had prompted the idea of
making Southside a "focal point of student activity".
By moving the U n i o n to the Southside basement there would be
what he called "the added advantage" of having space available in
Beit Q u a d . M r Smith suggested three possible uses for the current
U n i o n building. Firstly the top floor could be easily converted for extra
student accommodation. Secondly he admitted that the College has
been under pressure from the Life Sciences Division to expand their
facilities. T h e U n i v e r s i t y G r a n t s C o m m i t t e e ( U G C ) have also
instructed the College to increase the Life Sciences intake and this
