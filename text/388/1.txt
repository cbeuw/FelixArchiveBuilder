New Mines Mascot
T H E R S M Union meeting on
May l s t saw the unveiling of
the new Mines mascot, pre-
sumably s t i l l c a l l e d ' D a v y . '
It stands over two feet high
and rumour has it that it weighs
over eighty pounds. L i k e the
new ' T h e t a , ' R C S U n i o n ' s
mascot, it is 100% virgnal at
the moment.
C u r i o u s l y enough it is ten
years to the very month since
the old ' D a v y ' was first unveiled
in 1965. Before that time, the
R S M U mascot had been ' G u y ' a
Michelin rubber man who had
been around since February
1958.
C l e a r l y , I C ' s mascots must
now be the envy of every other
university and college in the
country.

THE R E F E C T O R Y Committee meeting of May 1st was
dominated by the prospect of an enormous catering loss for
the year ending July 1975. The running loss was believed to
be £39,000 at the end of March hence it is believed that the
College will want refectory price increases of the order of
20 — 30% at the end of term.
No real argument took place
since detailed d i s c u s s i o n has
been put off until a s p e c i a l l y
convened extraordinary meeting
of the committee next F r i d a y
(May 16th). A l s o to be d i s c u s s e d
then are proposals from the
Catering Manager, Mr Mooney,
that the prices of "brought i n "
goods such as meat p i e s ,
chicken p i e c e s , yogurt etc
should be increased immediately
because the profit margin has
a l l but d i s a p p e a r e d . l t is known
that IC U n i o n reps on the
committee w i l l try to oppose
m i d - s e s s i o n a l increases, but
their chances of s u c c e s s are
diminished by the enormity of
the catering l o s s .
In recent years this catering
loss has been covered by the
surplus on the bar and wine
cellar a c c o u n t s . It is under-
stood that these are expected
to be about £10,000 and £6,000 .
The shortfall this year is
expected to be about £20,000
and this w i l l more than wipe
out a l l reserves from previous
years put a s i d e for necessary
maintenance and replacement
of furniture and equipment.
The meeting ended with the
Catering Manager requesting
an interim increase of 20 on
beers. T h i s was to cover the
budget increase of e x c i s e duty
which the breweries have
passed on to the C o l l e g e . It
was pointed out that, on top
of this, b r e w e r i e s were
increasing prices by 1 — 2p.
D a v i d S i n c l a i r , the student
Chairman of the B a r Committee,
argued for not p a s s i n g on any
increase at the moment simply
because the sheer s i z e of even
the interim suggestion would
be very difficult to cover on a
student income. He is known
to want to hold prices down
until the end of term if p o s s i b l e .
Short shrift was given to this
idea by the committee but after
heated argument and support
from the I C U President, Trevor
P h i l l i p s , Mr S i n c l a i r proposed
doing nothing before the extra-
ordinary meeting on May 16th
with the rider that the Bar
Committee should meet i n the
meantime to make recommend-
a t i o n s . This was a c c e p t e d .
The net result is that until
May 16th, prices have been
fixed i n the refectories and
b a r s . Meanwhile, it is hoped
by the U n i o n that an announce-
ment of the s i z e of student
grants next year w i l l have
been made so that this can be
used as a guideline for the
s i z e o f r e f e c t o r y p r i c e
i n c r e a s e s . T a l k i n g to F E L I X
D a v i d Sinclair admitted "/'(/
be in for a sticky time at the
Bar Committee meeting on
Friday (today infact — E d . ) .
It will take a miracle for there
to be no increases this term y
