FIRST AN explanation. There was no F E L I X on
Wednesday for the simple reason that our main priority
this week has been to finish the printing of PHOENIX,
the ICU arts magazine'. If we do not get it done in the
very near future, then its actual publication will be
seriously at risk. Hopefully, the hard grind that has
been done in the past few days will bear fruit with the
availability of PHOENIX within the next two weeks.

I was rather puzzled, nay displeased, by the
appearance of a memo from the College Registry to
self-supporting students (including overseas students)
proclaiming the increase of £70 in the sessional fees.
I understand that THIS INCREASE HAS NOT Y E T
B E E N A P P R O V E D BY THE GOVERNING BODY hence
the memo is being blantantly presumptuous.
As regards the fee increase itself the Overseas
Students Committee is planning action in the form of a
petition and possibly a picket of the Governing Body
meeting on May 23rd. Anyone interested should contact
Chris Kourouniotis in the Maths Department.

Where has all the controversy gone? Has everyone
fallen into a dull stupor due to impending exams?
Where are all the literary giants who onced graced the
F E L I X letters column with their pearls of wisdom? And
who is Nigel Reditt anyway?

Pause for thought.
A L T H O U G H I hate to begin on the discordant note of c r i t i c i s i n g
F E L I X , I feel I must point out to the general public (?) that contrary
to what they may have been told, I am not Boadsheet Editor, but
something quite different, y e s you've guessed the obvious mistake...
I am in fact the IF Broadsheet Editor. Being Broadsheet Editor
means that it falls to my unhappy
lot to entice works of literary
talent from the already overwork-
ed students at I F . T h i s gets
increasingly difficult as the
longer you have been here in
French South Kensington, the
more difficult it is to remember
how to write and even express
oneself in E n g l i s h ! I hope
therefore that you w i l l excuse
any grammatical errors.
However, let us press on to
more interesting things. How
would you like to be introduced
to yet another member of IF
Union who was, unfortunately
omitted from that exhilarating
and inspiring article written by
our illustrious President. May I
introduce L i s e Bratton, our
Accommodation Secretary. Many
of you might say, not only have
I no idea who L i s e Bratton i s , I
haven't a c l u e who any of the
other members of IF Union are
either. The remedy, gentlemen,
is in your own hands, get
yourselves over here to I F and
v i s i t us in the Union Room. It's
always a pleasure to see new
faces. However, it may have to
be a lightning v i s i t as due to
the mountain of work we are
required to get through, we are
limited to only half an hour for
lunch. You may be sure that
this invitation has the blessing
of 'mon capitaine' who keeps us
all in order.
And now I'd like to thank you
a l l for watching my little show
here today, if you've enjoyed it
...don't miss next week's
exciting instalment.
REVIEW: Dramsoc
T H E I M P E R I A L C O L L E G E entry in the 20th Sunday Times
Students' Drama F e s t i v a l w a s a n excellent production of T o m
Stoppard's play 'Albert's Bridge!' The action moved very
smoothly among a number of simple sets on the large stage, w i t h
the rusty brown scaffolding of 'Albert's bridge a s a constant
backdrop .Albert, a philosophy student turned bridge painter-poet
was finely portrayed by E r i c S t o v e l l . He played the word-
intoxicated Stoppard character with precision and a fine sense of
the poetic pseudo-vision of this brilliantly-conceived character.
The blundering city off i c i a l s who hired Albert to paint the vast
bridge single-handedly were vividly depicted, and the rapid-fine
Stoppard give and take of their committee s e s s i o n s was handled
in an exhilarating fashion. Of particular note were John Woodfin
as the committee chairman, and Z i g g i Kronbergs a s F i t c h , the
flustered, efficiency-obsessed accountant. Mike Stanger and
Karen W i l l i s were very good a s his successful father and s u c c e s s -
oriented mother. The final scene, in w h i c h a n army of painters
approach the bridge, was marked by very fine sound effects; and
Stoppard's v i s i o n of a world s o crowded that people c a n only
move upwards into the higher reaches of 'Albert's' bridge is
brilliantly conveyed.
