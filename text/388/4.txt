IC WIN THE IL A 1 HLETIC C H A M P I O N S H I P
L A S T S A T U R D A Y , the University of London held its A t h l e t i c
Championships at Motopur Park Athletic Ground. A strange place,
you may say, to see the Imperial College Cross-Country team, but
they get around you know. Anyway, the team and a few friends
were there at 11.00 am to see what could be done about G u y ' s
H o s p i t a l , who had won the
trophy for the last ten years.
The day started slowly for
the IC C C C , mainly due to the
preponderance of middle-
distance runners in the team.
The first two events were the
Long-Jump and the 100m heats.
In the long-jump, Pete Johnson
and Dave Houlbrooke fought
hard for last place and
finished 11th and 12th, packing
w e l l at the rear.
Pete ran his next event at
marathon speed but since it
was the 100m he did not get a
place i n the final.
I C ' s first points of the day
came from K e v i n Brady, who
ran a fast 3000m steeplechase
to finish second behind U L ' s
t op runner, Martin Knapp.
Gaining more points for IC and
holding off the opposition was
Ian E l l i s who ran w e l l ,
recovering from an appalling
start to finish fourth.
In the field events, the
Cross-Country team lacked
style but made up for that by
determination, the only two
field events we did not cover
were the hammer and the high
jump.
The next track event was
the 3000m walk i n which we
had four entries. Rob A l l i n s o r i ,
having neglected the sport for
a couple of years came back /
w e l l to finish second, and Ian
E l l i s " f r e s h " from his steeple-
chase suprised everyone,
including himself by coming
third but he put.it down to
training with R A s h l e y . Steve
Webb walked into fifth place to
keep the other colleges down,
and P a d Donnelly finished
twelth.
In a hard 800m Rob A l l i n s o n
was fourth, but later in the
5000m, he pulled out a superb
run to finish second behind
Andy Crompton; Steve Webb
finished w e l l coming s i x t h .
The 400m hurdles gave IC
its only victory of the day,
Dave West winning in fine
style well ahead of the field,
in the depths of which Ian E l l i s
finished fourth.
Roy Rosser was the dark
horse of the IC team, nobody
quite knowing his potential.
After a fine run in the 400m,
where he finished second, just
beating Dave West, he then
proceeded to come second in
the triple jump.
The positions of the various
teams were read out at intervals
during the afternoon and at
about three o ' c l o c k it became
obvious to us that we were
serious contenders for the
trophy.
R e a l i s i n g that every point
mattered at this stage, P e t e
Johnson and Ian E l l i s were
hurriedly conscripted to attempt
the pole vault, the only problem
being neither of them had seen
a pole-vault pole i n his life
before,let alone used one. Pete
and Ian had precisely three goes
each to learn to pole vault and
to clear a bar of six feet in
height. Pete started first with
a brave run, but as he stuck his
pole i n , his hands s l i d down
the bar almost to knee height.
H i s second attempt comprised
of a faster run up and a faster
slide down the pole, and his
third attempt would have done
justice to a sprinter, as he
breasted the bar, off the p e g s .
Ian lined up for h i s jumps, ran
up, took off attained approxi-
mately 8 5 r
and promptly fell
sprawling on the grass on the
same side of the bar as he
took off. H i s second attempt
saw him clear of the bar but
neglect to let go of the pole,
and the third attempt saw him
clear of the bar to gain IC at
least one point. By clearing
the next height, and failing at
the one after, Ian managed a
commendable fifth behind such
people as the B r i t i s h Univer-
sities Sports champion (who
can jump nearly as high as Ian
pole-vaulted!)
The 1500m saw Steve Webb
in action again along with
Hurrican Houlbrooke. The pace
was carved out from the beginn-

L A S T S A T U R D A Y Hammersmith Amateurs opend the regatta
season on the Tideway. IC Novices a l s o known as the L u b L a b
Second E i g h t celebrated one year's rowing by winning the Marshal
Hays Challenge C u p .
Our qualifying race early in the afternoon was rowed with the
ft f - »
s i i i l i l
incoming tide up to Hammer-
smith Bridge . R o w i n g on the
centre station with the best of
the stream but the worst of the
choppy water to contend w i t h ,
we drew away from Cygnet and
National Westminster at the
start. Then with Tony stroking
at a rate which belied his
stature we increased our lead
at the finish to two lenghts,
thanks to a good deal of bashing
and not much technique.
We were on the water three
hours later for the final by
which time the tide had turned
so the race was rowed down-
stream from C h i s w i c k E y o t .
A g a i n we had the centre
station with Latyner Upper
Schoool on Surrey and T w i c k e n -
ham R C on Middlesex . Off the
start we were slightly down on
both crews, striding early to a
solid 34 on the fourteenth
stroke. Afte'r about twenty
strokes the other crews finished
their starting burst and we
began to drive through them,
leading by threequarters of a
length at two minutes. Latymer
who were striking w e l l into the
forties off the start, " b l e w "
but the Twickenham crew held
on strongly and it took expert
coxing by boatman Charlie
(12 stone?) to keep them out of
the stream and out of l u c k . At
the finish we were s t i l l three-
quarters of a length up w h i c h ,
having allowed half a length
for the curvature of the course
left a margin of about a c a n v a s .
Thanks to s k i l f u l coaching
we now,look forward to continued
s u c c e s s as a Senior C crew. In
the meantime extensive research
has shown that the Hays C u p

beer).
