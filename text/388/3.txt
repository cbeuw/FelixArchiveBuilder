F E L I X
Racial
Discrimination ?
AN H I L A R I O U S L Y SEXIST P O I N T O F VIEW
FROM K A R E N G A D D
IMAGINE
H a l l places are allocated not on the male/female basis but on
a B r i t i s h / F o r e i g n b a s i s . The percentage of places for foreign
students is always too low to match the number of foreign students
who ought to be in h a l l . No-one protests; no-one minds; anyway
British students need more looking after: tbey miss their Mothers.
Foreign students are trained to
look after themselves — of
course lots of foreign students
do get attacked and raped (even
male foreign students? — Ed.)
in London streets after dark.
But c'est la vie it's always
happened.
Well, one day representing
the foreign students, a terrifying
aggressive figure known round
C o l l e g e as 'Lady Anne'
protests and gets the. % of
places in h a l l s for foreign
students raised so that for once
they have more places than
they should .
The outcry is amazing. In a
s p e c i a l surprise issue of
F E L I X "Racial Discrimination"
is proclaimed and everyone is
shocked, including members of
the Joint Committee against
Sexism and F a c i s m . Protests
are made a l l over College and
the rumour spreads that ' L a d y
Anne' has gone too far this
t i m e .
Of course it couldn't happen.
We are much too enlightened to
be so petty and small minded.
We a l l understand about R a c i a l
Discrimination and we a l l know
it's a 'bad thing' - no-one in
their right mind would complain
that there Is racial d i s c r i m i n a -
tion against E n g l i s h students.
Compared with what foreign
students face it's laughable.
But with sexual d i s c r i m i n a -
tion it's different. Of course
there's nothing wrong with it.
It's funny. Men have been
sniggering at it for centuries
and even women often see the
joke. But now sexual d i s c r i m i n -
ation has taken on a new s i n i s t e r
form. "DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST MEN." Suddenly
nobody sees the joke anymore.
It's a serious issue: the men at
IC gather together in the bars
to moan about how oppressed
they are.
The question is - where'
w i l l it stop? If you're not careful,
you might find the knickers in
the Union Bar replaced by V ' —
fronts — with their t i t i l l a t i n g '
contrast colour e l a s t i c . The
pictures in F E L I X might feature
something like "Mike — this
handsome hunk hails from
Chemistry" e t c . Perhaps even
the lewd s e x i s t entertainments
offered in College Revues w i l l
be threatened. T h e r e ' l l be no
end to it unless it's stopped.
Men of IC unite, your position
is threatened. Stick out those
puny chests of yours and assert
your masculine rights. For who
knows, if you let the women of
this college c l a i m their basic
rights, it might lead anywhere .
Besides if you give them
an inch they'll discover that
there isn't anymore.
IF Y O U are one of these astrological freaks with exams
coming up, watch out! You haven't a chance — at least, not
with a partial e c l i p s e of the Sun on Sunday morning. Y e s , the
die i s cast, and at 6.54 a.m. the Moon w i l l begin its passage
across the solar disk first appearing as a small nick out of the
top right-hand side. By 7.19, as the e c l i p s e reaches its mid-
point the Sun w i l l have taken on the appearence of a Luminous
Mooney (?) beefburger with a large bite out of it, so if you s t i l l
crawling homewards at that time, don't worry — i t ' s not.
Those eager to observe the e c l i p s e are not advised to use
telescopes or binoculars directly on the Sun — it tends to
cause holes in the back of the head. F a r safer and much more
convenient i s to project an image from the eyepiece on to a
sheet of paper. If you haven't got an optical instrument, don't
look directly with the naked eye. Some old photographic nega-
tives or colour slides that " d i d n ' t come o u t " are useful for
brief looks, but if you want to stare at it any length of time fill
a bucket with water and watch the reflection.
B y 8.18 the e c l i p s e w i l l be over and the Sun whole again.
Students are not reputed for early r i s i n g on Sunday mornings,
but weather permitting, this should be something worth getting
up for.
