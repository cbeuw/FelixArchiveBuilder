campaigners increasing feared that
the legislature might allow abortion
in limited circumstances. To resolve
the issue for once and for all, they
decided to act to constitutionally ban
abortion in Ireland. Des Hanafin, a
senator for Ireland's largest political
party, Fianna Fail, and a trustee of
the pro-life, anti-abortion
campaign, said 'henceforth,
abortion cannot be introduced into
Ireland by court, or legislature, but
only if the majority of Irish people
choose to do so in a referendum.
This is pure democracy.'
During the campaign, the
Catholic church in Ireland
flagrantly abused its position of
responsibility. Sunday after Sunday
priests and bishops told the
congregation from the pulpit how
to vote. The Fianna Fail party, then
in opposition, played electoral silly
beggars with the wording of the
referendum, acting purely out of
party political expediency. A debate
which had begun to start on
abortion was stifled, then repressed
by the din, and the lies, and the
black propaganda of the pro-life,
anti-abortion lobby.
The 1983 anti abortion
constitutional amendment was
passed by 67% of the population,
and created a suffocating and
retarding shame as its consequences
slimed from under the carpet. The
reactionary, conservative,
repressive elements that had formed
an savage alliance in 1983 now
became a predatory presence,
sweeping and demolishing any
possibility of reform, of intelligent
thought, of freedom. Marital
reform, rights to abortion
information, rights to travel were
summarily executed by ideological
thuggery.
Relief began to be personified in
Mary Robinson, a liberal lawyer
who had fought in the European
court for Irish women to at least
have the right to information on
abortion. In October 1990, Mary
Robinson was elected Irish
President in the biggest electoral
upset since the foundation of the
state. Her election was seen as a
maturing experience, an exorcising
of guilt, of the women of Ireland,
mnd na hEireann, not rocking the
cradle, but rocking the system. In
the last month of the campaign, she
was told by two bible-clutching
elderly women outside a Catholic
church in Ballina, 'we voted against
abortion and divorce, and we're
ashamed we did. We're going to
vote for you.'
The new liberalism was short
lived. The largest party in Ireland's
coalition government, Fianna Fail,
tried a brief courtship with the post
Robinson agenda. In March 1991,
the then Irish Prime Minister
(Taoiseach), Charles Haughey,
casually announced that condoms
would be made available from
places other than chemists, and that
they could be available to those over
16. Some of Haughey's party
members, the bedrock of Irish
Conservatism, were shocked.
Haughey supporters were
dismissive of their concern. 'Fuck
them. They have nowhere else to
go,' said one. Then Ireland's
bishops waded in. 'No political
party in this country is prepared to
defend fundamental values of
family life,' thundered the
Archbishop of Dublin. The plan
was dropped.
decision, the Irish Times led with
Martyn Turner's cartoon captioned,
'17 February 1992. The
introduction of internment in
Ireland for 14 year old girls.'
The X case had several
immediate implications. The most
human was the suffering of the 14
year old, and the possibility of her
committing suicide. A death in
these circumstances would not have
been unusual. In 1984, 14 year old
Ann Lovett bled to death beside the
statue of the Virgin Mary as she
gave birth to her baby. The dead
baby was still attached by its
umbilical cord when its mother's
body was eventually found in the
H i
Eleven months later, the
obscenity of Ireland's national
hypocrisy on morality reemerged.
The Irish Attorney General, acting
under the 1983 amendment to the
Irish constitution, sought an
injunction in the district court
against a woman travelling to
Britain for an abortion. What
distinguished this woman from the
40,000 others who travel freely a
year was that she went to the Irish
police (Gardaf) to provide a sample
of the foetal tissue. X was a rape
victim, and she was fourteen years
of age.
. T h e case of X traumatised the
population, and the upholding of the
original injunction, including the
ban on travel, in the Irish High
court caused outrage in sections of
public opinion. The day after the
church, her schoolbag close by. It
is unlikely that this is one of the
formaldehyde imprisoned foetuses
used by SPUC for sex education in
Irish schools.
Other implications were of a
European dimension. The ban on
the girl travelling to Britain for an
abortion seemed to be a direct
contravention on the right to travel
under the Treaty of Rome, the
treaty that started the E C . Also, as
she was banned not for where she
was travelling to, but for why she
was travelling, the Irish courts
seemed to be deciding what the girl
could do in a foreign country. This
was the Irish constitution conferring
on Irish courts the rights of
extraterritorial jurisdiction.
The most significant implication
of the case was that it highlighted
how European law had been altered
to accommodate Ireland's abortion
laws. Under the Maastricht treaty,
signed by all European countries in
December 1991, abortion was
considered as a 'service'. Thus,
under European law, Irish women
would be able to avail of abortions
in other countries, completely
legally and above board. Despite
the fact that thousands of Irish
women go abroad for abortions
anyway, this Maastricht provision
flatly contradicted the Irish
constitutional position. Under Irish
law, travelling abroad for an
abortion is illegal. But, as Ireland
had already approved the Single
European Act in a referendum in
1987, European law took
precedence over Irish law, so once
Maastricht was ratified, overseas
abortions would be legal for Irish
women. This would have caused
severe political difficulties when the
time came for Maastricht to be
ratified by Ireland. (Maastricht had
to be ratified by referendum as it
affected Ireland's sovereignty.) Pro-
life, anti-abortion campaigners
rights to travel
were summarily
executed by
ideological
thuggery
would have claimed that Maastricht
equalled back door abortions for
Ireland.
This particular problem was
apparently circumvented by the
insertion of a clause in the protocol
to the Maastricht agreement. The
clause, negotiated by Irish premier
Haughey after being approached by
Des Hanafin, was to serve as an
electric fence around the Irish
constitutional ban on abortion. The
clause said simply that European
law would not affect the Irish
constitutional position on abortion,
as amended in 1983 or in
subsequent amendments. Thus, the
Irish constitutional position was
beyond impeachment. The case of
X brought this rather
inconsequential clause in the
protocol into stunning focus. At that
time, if the right to the abortion had
been refused to the girl by Ireland's
highest courts, then she would have
had recourse to the European court.
Had her case occurred after
ratification of Maastricht, then she
could not have appealed to Europe,
as the constitutional position could
no longer be affected by European
law.
