harassment nor does it prejudice
future complaints. Nobody has to
tolerate sexual harassment and if
this method fails you should talk the
problem over with a friend or
anyone on the list at the end of this
article.
If an incident worries you, even
if it seems trivial, then contact
somebody about it. Any discussions
with the relevant ICU staff will be
confidential and no further action
will be taken without your express
permission. If harassment continues
then you could see Mandy Hurford
- Union General Manager - or
Stefano Ruis - Union Welfare
Advisor - who will discuss the
situation with you. If you felt more
comfortable with a friend, then
bring them along.
The appropriate disciplinary
procedures will only be instigated
if you, or your proxy, want to
continue. It may be useful if you
could keep a note of the details of
the relevant incidents in case you
want to take this option.
The ICU Guidelines on Sexual
Harassment
The cardinal rule is that complete
confidentiality will be maintained if
the complainant wishes it so, and no
action will be taken without the
complainant's consent.
Because harassment is a difficult
subject, ICU recognises that the
normal channels for handling
grievances may be hard to use.
Because of this, the Union offers
confidential guidance and support,
with the non-obligatory option of
taking the complaint further. Such
Union guidance can be discussed
with nominated members of ICU
staff, at least one of whom will be
a woman.
Any investigation of a complaint
will be handled with sensitivity and
respect for the rights of both
interested parties. The complainant
has the right to be supported by
whomsoever they choose. Reports
of harassment will be dealt with in
all possible speed and appropriate
action will only be taken in
consultation with the complainant.
Although some cases can be dealt
with informally, such action may,
provide grounds for disciplinary
measures under existing Union or
College regulations. If the
complainant does not wish to
undertake a lengthy disciplinary
procedure, the Union understands
that there is a need for immediate
and effective action.

Naturally, all records of
allegations of harassment will be
treated confidentially, and the
Union will ensure that the alleged
harasser has access to impartial
representation and is allowed to
state their case. The Union also
accepts that there is the possibility
that some individuals may bring
spurious, frivolous or malicious
allegations of harassment which
may be dealt with through
disciplinary proceedings.
If a person is subjected to
harassment in the Union Building
or environs, particularly in the
Union bar, and makes an specific
complaint to a member of Union
staff, that member of staff has the
duty to warn the offender that their
actions could result in the closure
of the Union Bar and the cessation
of alcohol sales until they leave.
The offender should be given two
clear warnings and if this is not
enough then the bar will be closed,
not to be re- opened until the
offender has left Union grounds.
