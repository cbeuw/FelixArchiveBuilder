Turtle Beach Shadow
Set in the height of the political
crisis surrounding the boat people,
Turtle Beach stars Greta Scacchi as
journalist Judith Wilkes trying to
expose the squalor of the refugee
camps in Malaysia. Finding herself
barred from entering the camps
Judith befriends Minou Hobday
(Joan Chen), wife of the Australian
High Commissioner and ex-bar
girl, and in the process meets the
charismatic Kanan (Arf Malik).
Once she witnesses the horrors of
the camp and the attacks by Malay
villagers on newly arrived refugees,
she finds herself drawn into a web
of political machinations.
The story's location, Turtle
Beach is a clever one. It is the only
nesting site for Greenback Turtles,
and their struggle for survival is
analogous of the refugees'. They
have to brave the heat, predators
and make it to the freedom of the
The portrayal of the clash of
cultures works extremely well.
West bludgeoning East with
civilisation whilst East seduces
West with sensuality. In a way, it
is about how we in the West attempt
to apply morals to situations where
they are totally unfitting.
Despite the excellent atmosphere,
the acting, for me, was wooden at
the beginning only becoming
average towards the end.
Essentially everything was there but
it didn't come together to do justice
to such a topic. Quite a let down.

Ghost Sonata
Arkenholtz is a student with a
strange talent. Born on a Sunday,
he has the power of second sight.
He can see ghosts, but treats them
as normal people since he is only
vaguely aware of what they really
are.
He is also unaware of the true
identity of Hummel, an old man
who wraps Arkenholtz in a web,
twisting the boy's life to his own
ends. Hummel invites Arkenholtz
to the 'Ghost Supper' and
introduces him to a world of
sophisticated opulence. Slowly,
however, Arkenholtz discovers that
the house he so admires hides a
world of delusion, mental torture
and vampiric shackles.
The first part of the play is mimed
to classical music and the same
themes from Beethoven, Greig,
Rachmaninov and Des de Moor
reoccur throughout. The theme of
the play is one person's hold over
another so leaving the theatre
feeling drained and empty was quite
appropriate. Some scenes were
convincingly performed, especially
the emergence of the Mummy as a
woman in mental agony which left
me feeling revolted.
The play, by August Strindburg,
has been put on by the Sturdy
Beggars Theatre Company as a
neglected classic. The theatre is
quite small, so you must book 24
hours in advance.

Lights on to a room in a tenement
block in Dublin, 1920. A poet at
work and his room-mate, Seumas
Shields, sleeping the morning away.
This is a day in the life of the
residents of the tenement in the
times of the troubles. Donal
Davoran, the poet, is suspected by
his neighbours as being an IRA
gunman, and revered for being so
and M r Shields is a pedlar.
Somehow they are landed with a
bag full of explosives, and that night
the Tans raid the house. Disaster
looms. I remember reading this play
and liking it a lot. It gives a
powerful insight into the effect of
the 'troubles' on the Irish. It was
this work that brought Sean
O'Casey into recognition as one of
the major playwrights of the 20th
century.
It was hard to see past the awful
accents and bad acting of a few
members of the cast, and this
production leaves one feeling a little
disappointed. Richard Kates as the
pretentious poet was excellent and
Edmund Dehn as M r Grigson was
especially good. A l l other
performances fell within the range
of mediocre to abysmal. The
performances may well improve
and somehow O'Casey's brilliance
seeps through.
