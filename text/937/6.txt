Feature Felix 937 5 June 1992
The situation was made even
more complex when the Irish
Supreme Court delivered its verdict
on the X case. Initially, it appeared
that the Supreme Court had gone
bananas, but on closer inspection
their judgement accurately reflected
the constitutional amendment. The
amendment reads, 'The state
acknowledges the right to life of the
unborn and, with due regard to the
right to life of the mother,
guarantees in its taws to respect,
and, as far as practicable, by its
laws to defend and vindicate that
in Ireland, but this was an
irrelevancy, as she had already gone
to Britain for the termination by the
time the Supreme Court judgement
had been announced.
The judgement, in conjunction
with the Maastricht protocol,
caused heat, fury, and very little
light. Pro-life, anti-abortion
campaigners claimed that
ratification of Maastricht would
lead to the imposition of abortions
in Ireland, and demanded a new
referendum to completely outlaw
abortion without any confusion.
and the child, would a new
referendum give more importance
to the life of the child as opposed
to the life of the mother? Would
precedence of citizenship be given
to a foetus that is not even a citizen?
Pro-choice, pro-abortiori
campaigners were far from happy,
as Maastricht and the Supreme
Court ruling would lead to a ban on
the right to travel for pregnant
women, and a continuation of the
ban on the right to information.
They also wanted a referendum, to
place rights to travel and
right.' Using the phrase 'with due
regard to the right to life of the
mother', the judges argued that as
there was a strong possibility of the
girl committing suicide, then the
right to life of the child was
threatened by both having and not
having an abortion, but the right to
life of the mother was threatened
only by not having the abortion. On
these grounds, the girl could have
the abortion in Ireland. This
opened the way to abortion in
Ireland under limited conditions.
The second section of the
judgement stated that the right to
life of the child under the Irish
constitution was greater than the
right to travel. Thus, the girl could
not travel to Britain for her
abortion, and she already could not
be told that abortion services were
available, or what these services
entailed. She could, of course, be
told all this about abortion services
They completely missed the double
irony that abortion in Ireland was
now legal under the very
amendment that they constructed to
ban abortion, and that the legality
of abortions was to be copper-
fastened by the Maastricht protocol
clause that they insisted be inserted
to prevent the European community
from 'imposing' abortion on 'poor,
sweet, innocent Ireland'. The salt
was firmly rubbed as the whole
controversy, and undermining of
the pro-life, anti-abortion position,
had started with the type of case that
pro-life, anti-abortion campaigners
smoothly and smugly said could
never happen, when the appalling
spectre of abortion after rape was
raised in 1983.
Anti-abortionists have also failed
to draft a text for a new anti-
abortion referendum. Given that the
previous form of words gave
equality to the lives of the mother
information in the constitution. This
left Ireland facing two, possibly
three separate referenda. One or
two abortion based ones, either
completely outlawing abortion in
however draconian a manner, or
establishing travel/information
rights, and another on Maastricht
ratification. The question was,
which referendum was to come
first.
The Irish government, now led
by Albert Reynolds, who became
Taoiseach after the resignation of
Charles Haughey at the end of
January 92, said that the Maastricht
debate was to come first. This
decision was arrived at after a
botched attempt to change the
protocol, and not without
considerable confusion. The junior
partner in the Irish coalition
government, the Progressive
Democrats, favoured having an
abortion referendum first. This
Reynolds was loath to do. He
desperately wanted to avoid a
divisive referendum either about or
before Maastricht, and wanted to
carry the majority of the population
with him on Maastricht. This he
would not be able to do if the
Maastricht issue became seriously
clouded with the abortion issue.
Reynolds was assuming that, with
abortion shoved under the mat for
a while, he could bank on the
extensive pro-Europe outlook of
Ireland to get Maastricht through.
He was well aware of the
consequences if he failed in this,
something now clearly evident by
the Danish decision to reject
ratification. Indeed, the Danish vote
could now make the Irish debate
entirely superfluous.
It did not take long for the
interested parties to line up on either
side of the Maastricht debate. In
the Catholic
Church may be
saving its
ammunition for
the abortion
debate
favour of ratification were all of the
major political parties; Fianna Fail,
Fine Gael, Labour (bar two MPs)
and the Progressive Democrats, all
for different reasons. Trade Unions,
Farmers' Groups and the
Federation of Irish Employers are
also in favour. Against ratification
are the fledgling Democratic Left,
and what remains of the (Stalinist)
Workers' Party. Both these groups
are on the left of the political
spectrum. Also against are the pro-
life, anti-abortion group, and
women's rights groups, for the
reasons explained above. A
significant addition to the 'nays' is
Senator Des Hanafin, who has now
had the Fianna Fail whip withdrawn
from him. Senator Hanafin
spearheaded the 1983 referendum,
and played a major role in the
insertion of the Maastricht protocol
clause.
The group of interest to everyone
was the Catholic Church. Which
way would the prelates jump? An
interesting straw in the wind was the
decision by the Irish farmers'
groups to support Maastricht
ratification. Even though it was
their support for Europe, and
indeed the financial benefits they
derive from the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP), that
allowed the ratification of the 1987
Single European Act to romp home
with a 70% vote, it was also the
rural vote that swung the 1983 anti-
