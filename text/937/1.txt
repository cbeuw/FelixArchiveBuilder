Dr Elizabeth Johnson, a physicist at Imperial College and Co-ordinator of the 'Daphne Jackson Memorial Fellowships Trust' told Felix this
week that women were poorly represented on academic staff at IC. 'The percentage of women goes down as one goes up in rank' she said.

Car Park Privatised without Consultation
Imperial College trade unions have
reacted with fury to plans to
privatise the College car parking
service. Mick Saul, of the National
Union of Public Employees
(NUPE), said that the unions had
not been consulted on the plans. Ian
French, of the Manufacturing
Science and Finance Union (MSF),
said that he thought the College
would have learned how to conduct
industrial relations after the
"trauma' of the Messenger, Security
and Car Parking dispute earlier this
year.
The proposal is detailed in a
paper produced by the College
Management and Planning Group
(MPG) meeting of 14 May. Headed
'Contracting Out of South
Kensington Car Park
Management,' it recommends the
privatisation of the service on the
basis of the arguments presented in
two papers submitted to M P G
meetings on 11 July 1991 and 9
April 1992. The paper also
announces that a tender has been
awarded to Axess Management Ltd,
who will take up management of the
car park on 29 June.
Speaking to j'CNN, Val Straw, IC
Facilities Manager, said that car
parking staff will return to normal
security duties when the new
management team takes over. She
added that she didn't think that there
would be any major problems in
installing the regime. The proposal
has yet to be passed by Sir Eric
Ash, IC Rector, and the College
Governing Body.
When asked if any consultations
had taken place on the privatisation,
Ms Straw demanded to know who
should be consulted. Sir Eric said
that as far as he knew, the trade
unions had already been consulted
at this stage, something Ms Straw
did not deny. Last night, trade
union spokesmen completely
contradicted this.
Mr French said that he would be
very angry if these proposals were
to be implemented without
consultation. He said that as the
matter had been considered by the
College Parking Committee, on
which both Ms Straw and the trade
unions sit, then Ms Straw had ample
opportunity to inform unions of any
awarding of tenders. He added that
the unions had been relying on
rumour and guesswork up to this
point.
The proposal to privatise the car
park has been under consideration
since the resolution of the
Messenger, Security and Car
Parking dispute. At the time, the
Governing Body decided that the
car park should be considered
separately from the rest of the
security and messenger system. The
Parking Committee was set up to
enable this to occur.
The car park discussions have
been based on a report produced by
independent consultants. The report
was apparently exploring ways to
maximise the £80,000 annual profit
the car park currently makes. At the
time of the dispute, Estates
Director, Gordon Marshall, is
reported to have said that the car
park just broke even. M r Marshall
was unavailable for comment
yesterday, and was apparently not
in the college. M r French wanted
to know why the consultants' report
has not been openly circulated. He
also asked for the brief for the
consultants to be released.
Ms Straw confirmed the
appointment of a college fire officer
last week. She said that the officer,
as yet unnamed, had a wide
background in the field of fire safety
and is a former fire brigade officer.
The officer will oversee the drafting
and implementation of a new fire
safety policy and the impending
upgrade of fire alarms. Ms Straw
refused to deny that the contract for
the fire alarm upgrade would be
awarded to the company contracted
by London Weekend Television for
the same work. The fire company
'may well have done work' for
L W T , she said.
