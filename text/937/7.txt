abortion referendum in favour of
the pro-life groups with a 67% vote.
Did their support for Maastricht
indicate that the influence of the
Church on matters of state was on
the wane? Thanks to Bishop Casey,
the answer can only be guessed at,
though his case shows that the
Church's influence on moral
matters is now being treated with a
bit more cynicism than before.
The Casey factor may indeed
have affected the eventual Church
decision, though senior
correspondents suggest that the
Church position is more due to
genuine confusion. They were
caught between supporting
Maastricht, and in effect supporting
limited abortion in Ireland, or
rejecting Maastricht, and
sabotaging the financial state of the
nation, considering that Ireland
hugely depends on the C A P and on
the regional and social funding
(ERDF, ESDF) it receives from the
E C .
In the event, the Church advised
to neither accept or reject, ignored
the substance of Maastricht entirely,
and called for an abortion
referendum. Showing a slight
inclination to the extremists in the
pro-life anti-abortion parties, their
soul mates from 1983, the Church
spokesman, Bishop Joseph Duffy
said in reference to the holding an
the Maastricht
protocol
'imposed'
abortion on
'poor, sweet
innocent
Ireland'
abortion referendum, 'this would be
one of Ireland's most distinctive
contributions to the soul of Europe.'
The pro-Maastricht parties now
forged ahead with their yes
campaign. The Church was
effectively neutralised, and
Reynolds went full hog to isolate
what he regarded as the remaining
extremists. He played strongly on
the financial gains Ireland has made
from the European Community. As
Ireland is on the periphery of
Europe ,a large claim will be
available from the 'Cohesion
Fund,' set up to counter the effects
of the 'Golden Triangle' of the
financial centres of London,
Frankfurt and Milan. While no cash
is on the table for the fund, the
carrot waved by Reynolds is in the
order of magnitude of six billion
pounds over five years. This money
is in addition to the money already
promised under the agricultural
policy, the social fund, and the
regional development fund. In the
debate on the Maastricht
referendum, Reynolds told the Irish
parliament, 'Any suggestion that
Ireland will not be a full member
in future of the Single Market and
of the Union would cause a major
loss in investment confidence with
devastating consequences for jobs.'
Now all has changed. The
decision by the Danish people to
reject the Maastricht treaty has
evened the scales, and both the
Maastricht and the abortion
battlegrounds have been redrawn.
The anti-Maastricht parties are
claiming not so much victory,
rather that the referendum is over
before it even began. 'It's a dead
duck,' said one spokesman just
hours after the result of the
Denmark vote was announced. The
Irish government were described by
a reporter on the Irish Press as
'headless chickens', and officially,
the Taoiseach's office would only
say that they were 'making
consultations.'
The Danish decision has opened
\tp several interesting possibilities.
As the treaty looks certain to be
renegotiated, there is the option of
the removal of the clause in the
protocol. This would leave Irish
women able to travel abroad to avail
of the abortion 'service', as well as
being able to have abortions in
Ireland so long as there is a threat
to the life of the mother. Whatever
happens, the debate will have to
return to a referendum on abortion.
A referendum had been planned on
the right to information in
November. This may be added to
by a total review of the abortion
law.
Before this is to be considered,
the Government must also clear
three pieces of legislation already
promised, and the progress to date
does not bode well for abortion
reform. A White Paper on marital
breakdown and divorce was due to
be debated in the Irish parliament
before the summer, but has now
apparently been 'shelved'.
Taoiseach Reynolds had promised
legislation this year to decriminalise
homosexuality, after being
instructed to do so by the European
community. This is now unlikely to
happen until 1993. The new family
planning bill, following on from the
1991 Haughey proposals, has now
sunk, apparently without trace.
That the Government's timetable
for piecemeal reform has been
scuppered by the Danish vote is
beyond doubt. It will now have to
contend with a renegotiation of
Maastricht, under a more constant
public gaze than existed before. It
will also have to deal with the
abortion issues post Maastricht. A
lot will depend on how much Albert
Reynolds thinks he needs the liberal
vote to give him the overall majority
that has escaped his party for the
past five elections.
A minor worry is that, should
attempts be made to
constitutionalise abortion, the anti-
abortion, pro-life campaign may
stand in parliamentary
constituencies against Fianna Fail.
Of more immediate concern, the
Irish government believes that the
Catholic Church is saving its heavy
ammunition for the upcoming
abortion debate, post Maastricht.
The church is already preparing its
agenda, its plans to turn back the
clock, to be dogmatic, oppressive,
insensitive. On line is complete
prohibition of abortion, restrictions
in the right to travel, and the
complete abolition of the right to
information. Nothing would be a
clearer signal that the church, and
its militant, fundamental extremists
in the pro-life group, have learned
nothing. They have not learned
respect, tolerance or pluralism. As
such, they should accept that they
have been, and remain a significant
retarding factor in the development
of a modern Irish society, that their
agenda will keep the Irish people in
an infantile morality, and that they
will continue to foster a culture of
stupidity. But whatever the weight
of the church's artillery, they may
learn painfully that the public mood
has changed, that their reputation
has been damaged, and that there
is a possibility that the power to
decide the nation's policy may
finally be wrested from them.
