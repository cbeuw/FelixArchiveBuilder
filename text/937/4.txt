With acknowlegements and
thanks to Martyn Turner for the
cartoon, which first appeared in
'The Irish Times. '
'If a nun is raped, she must have
the child.' This is the voice of Irish
Catholic values, as articulated by
Mary Lucey, of the pro-life, anti-
abortion Society for the Protection
of the Unborn Child (SPUC). It is
also the voice of what has become
Ireland's hypocrisy, for Mary
Lucey adds, 'if a woman is raped,
she is entitled to the morning after
pill.'
Ireland's organised hypocrisy.
The hypocrisy of a celibate church
where a senior cleric fathers and
disowns a child. The hypocrisy of
a people which apparently ban
abortion in a constitutional
referendum, yet ignore the plight of
40,000 Irish women who travel to
Britain each year for termination.
The hypocrisy of a nation which
frames and jails the mother of a still
born baby for murder, and which
this year barred a fourteen year old
rape victim from travelling to
Britain for an abortion.
For many years, abortion was
one of many subjects that Ireland
did not, dare not discuss. Abortion
was illegal both in moral and civil
law. The Catholic Church decreed
that abortion was mortal sin. The
1861 Offences Against The Person
Act ensured that the church's will
was done. When Eamonn de Valera
drew up the new constitution for the
fledgling state of Eire in 1937, he
had sufficient consultation with the
bishops to ensure that what was not
on the church's agenda was off the
constitutional agenda. Marital
separation, divorce, contraception,
abortion were all banned in the
new, free, pluralistic society.
Cracks in the moral veneer
appeared in 1973, when the ban on
the use of contraceptives was
breached. In the McGee case, the
Irish Supreme Court decided that
under the constitutional right to
privacy, a married couple was able
to import contraceptives for their
own personal use. What alarmed
Irish pro-life, anti-abortion
campaigners was that this was the
same reasoning used that year by
the United States Supreme Court in
the Roe V Wade case, which led to
the federal legalisation of abortion
in the United States.
With a trickle of liberalisation
permeating through the Irish
psyche, pro-life, anti-abortion
