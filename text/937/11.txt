- A c a d e m y
The Frank & Walters are better than
The Sultans Of Ping FC. There is
no doubt about it. There line in
inter-song banter would probably be
very amusing, were it
comprehensible. At least the songs
were recognisable, including covers
of 'Funky Cold Medina' and The
Monkees' 'Believer', thrown in
amongst their own songs, their
anthem, 'We Are The Frank &
Walters', and assorted other
selections from epl, ep2 and ep3.
Carter axe also better than The
Sultans Of Ping F C . But it's their
fans that puzzle me. Tonight the
Academy is a sea of white, the
white of Carter shirts, with the odd
floating jetsam of new blue Carter
shirts, and black shark fins in black
Carter shirts. Anyone would think
they we didn't know that they liked
Kingmakei
-T&C
call me a git if it pleases you more,
but in the days when I bought a T-
shirt at every gig I went to, things
used to be done differently. Why on
earth is it that nobody wants to be
a pop star anymore? In the good ole
days (about two years ago) bands
actually seemed to give a toss about
whether 'the kids' were enjoying
themselves, but in the era of the
anonymous shoegazer that seems
old hat. Tonight, Kingmaker are
abysmal. If any of their songs were
vaguely memorable I might have
forgiven them for being so
completely miserable but this band
are going nowhere fast. Admittedly,
for all of their five minute intro I
thought I was going to enjoy them,
but then they ruined everything by
coming on in a blaze of glory
unrivalled since John Major last had
peas for dinner. I can't put my
finger on what it is I don't like about
Kingmaker, maybe because my
finger is not big enough to cover all
their faults, but at a push I'd sum
things up by saying that they take
themselves too damn seriously! Not
, Frank &
Carter. Do they only have one T-
shirt, and if so, how do they keep
it so white. No one would think that
simply because they didn't wear a
Carter T- shirt that they didn't like
Carter. Not after moshing through
an hour and half of Carter, their
own songs and everyone else's -
The Smiths, The Jam, Pink Floyd.
And the loss of John Beast has
deeply affected their show, not as
if the Carter fans have noticed.
They still scream his war cry, 'You
Fat Bastard', as if nothing had
changed, but it has changed. No
more stages vanishing in a wall of
light. No. It was not in the least bit
painful to see the band all the way
through, apart from the inherent
pain involved in seeing them.
Carter played all the songs you'd
expect and finished with 'GI Blues',
as you'd expect.

, Suede
once during their whole
'performance' does anybody in the
band say anything more than the
obligatory 'Cheers, Ta, that was
called...', hardly the stuff that
mega-stars are made of. Okay, so
I'm being a bit harsh on
Kingmaker, after all it's not as if
they're the only ones at fault.
For all the hype about Suede they
too have a long way to go before
the quality of their live show
matches that of their songs.
However, the very fact that Suede
have some songs has endeared them
to me already, Suede could be big,
very big and very soon. They have
what Kingmaker don't, a sense of
humour and a sense of theatre and
that puts them way ahead of much
of the current pack of angry but
gutless bands. I could be wrong
about Kingmaker, maybe the future
of rock 'n' roll lies with singers that
can't sing, tunes you can't
remember three minutes after you
hear them and awkward silences
between songs in a live set, but I
hope not...if only for the sake of
Suede who appear to have a lot
more to offer the world.

The Pale
-Dogs with no
Tails
Yet another band from Ireland but
this time they're using fairly
classical Irish folk sounds—and
doing a fair job of it. Slightly catchy
perhaps even slightly more-ish, but,
I'm afraid to say, not the best thing
since sliced bread or even sliced
butter for that matter!

Live

Previously living its life as the
weakest cut on the '4 songs' ep,
now released as a single in it's own

demand. Live sound like a cross

taking the best of both worlds and
coming up with nothing.

denying it. Perhaps they still are.

Rain's old songs are still crap.
