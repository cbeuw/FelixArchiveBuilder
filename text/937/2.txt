A Total Farce Curried Prunes
Dear Adam,
After today's E G M someone
turned to me (knowing I take an
interest in our C C U and therefore
am tarred with the brush of ICU)
saying 'by the way I liked your
E G M today' his statement implying
that although held in the JCR with
microphones it probably had the
attention of about 40 people and was
a total farce.
I replied that UGM's are only
what the students make of them, to
this he answered (as is typical of
most IC students) 'well if the Union
elects itself to all its posts how can
you expect the students to take an
interest?'
When will the average IC student
realise, that the student unions (ICU
and CCU's alike) do not 'elect
themselves' they elect people who
are interested in running them and
bother to stand for the posts.
If this means tht only a small
selection of people go from post to
post then its the students who are
to blame. Posts must be Fdled
otherwise those selfsame students
who criticise the Union and deride
all involved will compalin when
things aren't done.
Anyone can stand for a post but
they have to know what's involved
to do it properly—to know requires
taking an interest in your Union, if
this means only those who have
been branded I C U / C C U hacks
stand it's because they've bothered
to take an interest.
I know this is an old rant but it's
obviously still valid. Either get
involved and improve what you
think is wrong or shut up.
Criticism for criticism's sake is
pointless.

Officer (C&GU), Hon Sec Elect

to most people and derided for it.
Dear Adam,
Poor old Declan, he's got it
wrong again! Clearly he is allowing
his socialist beliefs to cloud his
objectivity in his analysis of
'Voluntary Student Unions' (Felix
935).
I have no objections to him
publishing his opinions, but his
inaccurate comments about IC
ConSoc need to be corrected.
No Union money whatsoever is
paid by IC ConSoc to affiliate to the
Conservative Party in any shape or
form.
We do pay a nominal fee of £ 1 0
to affiliate to the Greater London
Area Conservatives, but this comes
from members subscriptions,
furthermore, as we are a democratic
society we do ballot our members
each year to check that our
affiliation is in accordance to their
wishes. No one has ever voted
against this affiliation. As a student
organisation we do not pay any
money to affiliate to Conservative
Students (which happens to be the
same as Conservative Collegiate
Forum).
So any money received from the
union is not used to stimulate
greater student interest in centre
right politics.
Clearly Declan has not got over
his party's disappointing
performance, at the General
Election, or the recent collapse of
IC Labour Club!
Yours,
Mark Richards,
Chairman,
IC Conservative Society.

City & Guilds Union in Dispute
Dear Adam,
I would like to point out certain
inaccuracies in the C & G Union
article (P4 Felix 936).
Currently, the C & G Union has a
hovercraft which hasn't run on a
proper trip this year because the
engine needs a rebuild and won't
run for more than 30 seconds. The
other 'hovercraft' consists of cut out
pieces of plywood waiting to be
bonded together, then fibreglassed,
have a new skirt made and fitted an
engine and drivegear installed.
The Motor Club, whilst maybe
being the largest of its type, has 200
members of which about 80 are
active. This is known because the
Club has a championship and
anybody who participates in any
events such as club nights or rallies
gets points in this championship. To
claim it is the best is disputable,
when it never enters the National
Student Motorsport Champion-
ships, though it did some years ago,
but the crews didn't get into the top
5 placings. Incidentally, Leeds
University Motor Club does best,
a small but active club.
Of course, these are just two
clubs, so now to an event or two.
How about the Cocktail Party. The
organiser of this went through the
guest list with the President of
Guilds so a good representation of
people in industry would be there.
From this one would deduce that
whilst the organiser organised the
venue, the drinks etc, both were
happy with the invites. Wrong!!!
The organiser in fact received an
incredible ear bashing when many
of the guests turned out to be from
ICU, local authorities, etc, i.e. not
industry. In fact, the Major
Captains of Industry were notable
in their absence!
Then there's the May Ball. An
Evelyn Gardens Hall of Residence
organised a May Ball with 95
people attending. The food was
better and it didn't have a guest
speaker with all the wit, charm and
charisma of a sack of potatoes.
Then there's the finance. Did you
know that the Guild's President gets
two free terms in Southside? Not
bad is it? It gets better. Because at
the C & G General Committee
Meeting a spreadsheet of Union
expenditure was shown and the
Honoraria of the Executive
Committee was overspent by £120.
This was due to the president
spending two weeks of his summer
holiday in South Ken and charging
it to the Union. Not very
responsible is it? Particularly when
he could have stayed with 'friends'.
I would therefore conclude that
the article was blatantly biased
bullshit and I'd like to see the author
of this article reply to my criticisms.
If they know their stuff they'll be
vindicated. I suspect not however...
Yours sincerely,
Name withheld by request.
