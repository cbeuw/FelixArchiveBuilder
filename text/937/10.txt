Music Felix 937 5 June 1992
Right Said
-Equinox
Fred The Real People
-Underworld
They knew we were coming
tonight. There was red carpet rolled
out onto Leicester Square, and
limos, and crowd control barriers.
All for me. I'm a star. The VIP re-
opening of the Empire Ballroom, as
a new club, competing directly on
a level with the hippodrome. No
contest. This place kicks the living
daylights out of that place, leaves
it stuggling for breath. The
Hippodrome is crap. Equinox is
not.
Of course, being a premium club,
in a prime site can lead to certain
prestigious prices. Lager at £2.80
a pint is not really good for the
student pocket. And at anything up
to twelve quid to get in, it begins
to look like a very expensive
evening. But fear not. Tuesdays is
student night, and it comes back
into the realm of the living. £ 1 . 5 0
to get in, and £1.50 a pint. And it's
open until 3.30. Not the thing for
those with exams the next day, but
for the rest.
Right Said Fred, incidentally,
were absolutely storming during
their three song set (Can you guess
what those three songs were,
readers?).

• Equinox, at the Empire, Leicester
Square (north side). Open Tuesday
to Saturday, from 9pm.
It was the first time I'd actually
gone to the Underworld and I was
pleasantly surprised. The drinks
weren't too expensive! We stood
around patiently waiting when the
Tambourines came on. I wasn't
expecting much (as they were
support at a small venue), but I was
wrong, they were pretty good. For
a while I thought it would be one
of those rare occasions when a
support band outshone the
Machine Gun Feedback
Hey I'm a
Spaceman
Machine Gun Feedback: Hey, Vm a Rockstar
Falcon
They say first impressions last, in
the case of this 12" there are four
first impressions—it would appear
that The Machine Gun Feedback
don't really know what kind of
music they're trying to make. The
A-side is a couple of wonderful
early Wonderstuff sound-a-likes.
The B-side however goes off at a
tangent. Having said that the 12" is
inspiringly different and
impressingly good.
Purple Velvet.
Out now on Sacred Heart.
music editor asked me what I was
doing that night (no he hasn't
extended his tastes to blokes); a
chance to go and listen to Machine
Gun Feedback live, whom I had
reviewed the week before.
Anyway back to the present (well
sort of). Having enjoyed their new
ep I thought 'what the hell', and
come 9pm I was stood outside the
Camden Falcon thinking 'I'm going
in there?'. I had already been
forewarned that the gig room was
a real pit—and were they right?
Back to the music. Machine Gun
Feedback were on first with no
introduction and they didn't ever
bother either. What can I say?
Better live than on a recording. It
has to be said that the cartoons
playing in the background were
more interesting than the act but the
music was on top form. A sort of
primitive psychedelic rock.
Godlike Bass came on shortly
after with some heavy duty crosses
between metal and goth—totally
mindblowing and worth moving to.
Getting too near the platform (stage
is too grand a term) was positively
dangerous with flying hair and
microphone stands on the loose.
A most excellent night out with
some good grooves that I can see
turning big time in the future.
Purple Velvet
headlining band, but on came The
Real People and showed me why
they were the main act. Their set
was much better than the
Tambourines, even though their
style was similar. Their fans,
however, were fans of both bands,
so both got good support from the
audience.
The best thing for me was that
both bands were scouse, as were a
lot of the fans following them, so
I felt right at home.

• 'Believer' is out now on
Columbia.
This Picture
-Borderline
The lead singer of This Picture
starts this concert fully dressed, and
proceeds through varying stages of
undress throughout the evening,
from 'Step Up' through '5.30' to
'Death's Sweet Religion', avoiding,
as ever, 'The Great Tree', and
showcasing some new tracks, most
of which remain sadly nameless, at
least to us, the audience. But the
swelling rush encapsulated in 'A
Violent Impression', remains, if
slightly watered down, with a
slightly unfinished feel to them.
This Picture stun, delight, and
confuse all at once.

The Orb
-Blue Room
The Orb return with a brand new
slice of ambience, drifting in and
out of consciousness like a bleary
eyed dream, which apparently
clocks in at just under forty minutes
in its full version. Fortunately for
us we have been furbished with a
four minute edit. This is an amazing
piece of music, and the fate that it
sounds almost the same as
everything else The Orb have ever
done is irrelevant.

• Blue Room is out on Monday.
