Felix Felix 937 5 June 1992
As usual, this column is an
attempt to immortalise individuals
by ascribing them completely
fictitious behaviour, revealed to
Marge by totally untrustworthy
sources.
Firstly a brief rundown of the
odds and ends around College. The
purity test has once again hit the
floor resulting in another change in
the betting stakes in this week's
instalment of Summer Leg Over 92.
Marge is no longer the clear leader,
being knocked out by new entry S
de G. Things have been getting
fraught in IC choir, resulting in the
loss of their conductor - and the
does not have access to the relevant
names, but there are two of them,
and what's the betting that the
cavorting in the cellar is continuing
unbeknownst to the relevant
authorities?
The resident grocer was also a
used car salesman in his time.
Would you buy a used union (ICU)
from this sabbatical? Certainly, his
neighbours want nothing to do with
it, or indeed him, complaining as
they are about loud noises from his
room in the dead of night. There's
even the mysterious appearance of
scantily clad figures of
indeterminate gender at ungodly
such behaviour is taken notice of by
otherwise bored Southside
residents.
Moving away from Jonathan
QktfftthB, where did all the Beit
Quad antiques come from recently?
I'm sure the aforementimuu -has
seen them, not in the mirror, but
from his window overlooking the
Biology department. If he had been
about in the Quad on Tuesday, he
would have seen a possessed
Harrington leading the annual Felix
scavenge hunt. The latter is now the
proud owner of a very old chest,
and also a chest of drawers.
Apparently, a sheet feeder was
Marge's Massive Column
Nicky Fox is unwell.
She is tired of trying to
excite her OAP, and has sought
refuge in her new 'toy-boy' Simon
de Goviere, whom she described
as 'cute.' Simon is reported to be
ignorant of the whole episode.
choirboy element pokes up in those
spankingly clean discussions
between Harvey Proctor and a be-
antlered Arctic ungulant whose
usual habitat is the Union Office.
Something about the preservation of
the moose species in Uganda, I'm
told (the explantion of the phrase
'Uganda' can be found in that
establishment organ, Private Eye).
Of course, we have to be very
selective, as do her suitors. We are
told by completely disreputable
sources that the discovery of a
condom wrapper in a Union room
to which only a few have access
resulted in the admission that this
particular arctic ungulant only uses
ribbed, coloured or flavoured trade
barriers.
The moose has been busy this
week. Not just with Harvey, but I
hear that she faces no danger of
being 'refused entry' to the Union
Bar. Staff (noun, a stick with some
special use, such as a walking stick
or an emblem of authority). Marge
hours, and I don't think it's the
V A T men checking up on his past
cucumbers, old as he is (31). After
all, they don't wear his brown
dressing gown. (Brown??)
SOHB H o g g , according to
reports, has been keeping his
landing awake, not just with his
frenzied yelping. As for the
numerous ciggy packets left
scattered about the landing, toilet
and even the shower, someone
should call Health and Safety. His
taste in music seems confined to
Deacon Blue and 'smoke gets in his
eyes'.
Who was it that made the ...
erm... 'rash' complaint on May 26
about the coarseness of the paper,
and got luscious green Andrex?
Soft, strong and not very long in the
establishment, as it was promptly
stolen, only to reappear in little
segments in HOBS Jfnng's rubbish
bin. The relevance of this tale is not
so much what the aforementioned
Union employee was up to, but that
purloined for the latest run of card
checking by the good Doktor. To
round off an abysmal skip hit,
DramSoc rescued a printer (no, not
Andy) about as bad as one of their
own productions. It was fairly old,
but not the oldest thing in the quad,
not while gnu knnui tutfn is here.
Unfortunately, there were no
curtains there in the pile, as a pair
is desperately needed by Sarah in
Tizard. One fond of preening, and
indeed cleaning, herself, she has yet
to learn the niceties of privacy.
Auntie Marge says, do it in front of
the bathroom mirror next time,
preferably with the door closed.
The door is closed this week on
Angus Frazer's office. Angus joins
Gordon Marshall on the great
holiday trail. Who next? Sheelagh
Crampton? Angus apparently does
a nice line in cricket, appearing as
he does in the latest Guinness
promotional brochure. Could this
be his next career move?
Who is it that drops the porno
mags down the air shafts in
Falmouth Keogh? Who picks them
up afterwards? Which former Pub
Board chair with a double-barrelled
surname has been ringing 0898
numbers recently? Who is the
Phantom Orgasm in Linstead Hall?
Which sabbatical has been 'fridge
fairying' with Martin Heighway?
And who is Marge? And where is
she?
