Sexual Harassment
Sexual
Harassment in
the Union -
what should be
done about it?
The Union plans
to implement a
policy on the
subject at the
AGM this
month.
Sexual harassment is a phenom-
enon which has been around as long
as the instinct that drives it. The
Neanderthal of old used to club his
wife with a bone and rape his
neighbour's daughter - nowadays
the Neanderthal barfly leches
through a drunken stupor at
anything in a skirt, even if it is
merely a picture of a hovercraft.
And you should not be so
complacent as to think such serious
injustices only took place in the dim
and distant past - it was only
recently that an English court ruled
that rape within marriage could
actually legally occur.
Sexual harassment causes
suffering; the victims may endure
anything from embarrassment to
anger, from fear to depression.
They may be driven to leave their
job or course; their mental health
may be damaged and they may feel
demeaned or isolated. It is not
anybody's position to judge the
rectitude of the victim's response -
it is the prerogative of any citizen
of a civilised country to try to help
somebody in pain and to attempt to
avoid such situations occurring in
future. To this end Imperial College
Union (ICU) has formulated a
policy on sexual harassment, the
complete wording of which can be
obtained from the Union or Felix
Offices. The final proposal is to be
put to the Unions Annual General
Meeting on 23 June this year - any
suggestions concerning the policy
should be made to Zoe Hellinger
(Union President, on 3501) by
Wednesday 17 June.
The Union takes the issue of
sexual harassment very seriously
and believes that it can be grounds
for disciplinary action. Ms
Hellinger has also noted that 'it
would also be beneficial if the
policy could be incorporated into
the College regulations.' Many
other Student Unions around the
country already have a standing on
this issue - to various effects.
Perhaps it is time that ICU should
recognise and deal with this issue.
The Working Definition of Sexual
Harassment
Any doubt as to what defines sexual
harassment should not deter
about
distress.
Likewise, any intimation that
complaint will cause embarrassment
should not be entertained - the
Union respects the sensitivity of the
issue and respects the necessity for
complete confidentiality.
Harassment can take many forms
and can be directed against women,
ethnic minorities, those of physical
or mental disabilities and those of
different sexual orientations or
ages. I C U defines sexual
harassment as 'repeated and
unwanted verbal or sexual

advances,' or in fact any action
which causes distress to a person
through physical contact, sexually
explicit remarks or the display of
sexually explicit material. It should
be made clear that any behaviour
that can make an individual feel
'unjustifiably' viewed as a sex
object may cause offence, even if
this is not intended. Differences in
culture or attitude - or even alcohol
consumption - can result in the
misinterpretation of social signals
such that what is perceived as
harmless fun by one party can result
in a hostile and intimidating
environment for the other.
Although it is conceded that
sexual harassment can be
experienced by both sexes, in the
vast majority of cases it is inflicted
on women through the deliberate
and unwelcome attentions of men.
Such behaviour can, under some
circumstances, be illegal under the
Sex Discrimination Act or the Race
Relations Act.
The Aims of the Policy
In order that the College's students
and staff can enjoy the Union in a
harassment-free environment,
where the dignity of individuals is
respected, the Union seeks to
prohibit sexual harassment on its
premises.
What Should Harassment Victims
Do?
The first step is to attempt to make
it clear to the offender that such
behaviour is unwelcome, but if you
feel you cannot do this, this
constitutes neither consent to
