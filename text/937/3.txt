5 June 1992 Felix 937 Clubs & Societies
'Pistol Anno Domini' is an event
which attracts 20,000 people, no
police, loads of blasters and no
crime. It is a sanctuary for the
civilised society. You can leave
your car open, your bag lying
around without the fear of anything
being stolen. The National Pistol
Associations Pistol A D , that is
Pistol '92 this year, held at Bisley
Camp in Surrey, is the largest pistol
meeting in the world attracting 1000
competitors shooting over five
days. Since shooting is the second
largest participatory sport in the
country (after fishing) one wonders
why there was little or no mention
of it in the media.
Amongst other things, Pistol A D
provides the impetus for a band of
mole like creatures to crawl out of
their dim, dusty, subterranean home
and expose their cannons to the
elements. The main objective of the
moles, known as the Imperial B
Team, was to defend the Howe
Cup. This task should have fallen
to the A Team, though due to
300 yards. The 100 yard stage is
two strings of five shots, each done
in 30 seconds. It is a test of nerve.
At the extended ranges the
ammunition (all home brewed) and
its interaction with the wind
becomes more significant. To give
one more time to puzzle over the
nature of the distribution, imagine
the area around the central black
target to be the size of doughnut
which you have hit with 10 shots in
10 minutes.
The pistols used (actually
revolvers) must be 'out of the box'
from a mass producer. The calibre
of choice is a .357 Magnum, using
a heavy bullet spat with a 8 inch
barrel. The Imperial team were
supposed to be equipped with at
least one such revolver. However,
due to a snarl up in the equipment
procurement programme,
attributable to the current executive,
aka the A Team, the B Team were
limited to 6 inch barrels. In
shooting, size is everything. Those
extra two inches offered increased
at 300 yards, together with his
earlier scores of 41/50 and 43/50,
to finish on 130/150. This was
enough to give him fourth place in
the Allcomers B section - no glass,
but a medallion plus a gold hat
badge thingy. PG Deeks, the third
and final member of Imperial B,
started with solid scores of 40/50
and 40/50 only to fall victim of the
wind later in the day with a 25/50
score at 300 yards. However,
DeekUs 105/150 was sufficient to
clearly beat Oxford's highest
individual score.
Oxford's final scores only
highlight the dominance which IC
now enjoy, with final placings in the
region of 17, 48 and 82. We are not
sure about the scores and names, so
we shall not include the names for
fear of libel.
Hurr also shot Sport Pistol -
finishing 8th overall, and received
a little bronze badge to add to his
gold one. He also wanted even
more space dedicated to him
because he provided transport -
bizarre team tactics, they decided
not to turn up. To adequately
describe them would necessitate a
digression from the Queen's
English. For the purposes of this
report they could be described by
a four letter word that described the
brown dog that was jumped over by
the quick fox - followed by gits.
The Howe Cup is an inter-
university cup for long range pistol
shooting. The university used to
mean Oxford - who were the only
ones to know of the cup's existence.
But since the IC Rifle & Pistol Club
found out about it, the cup reads
'Imperial, Imperial, Imperial,
Imperial.'
Long range pistol is shot over
distances of 100, 200 and finally
muzzle velocity, reduced recoil,
and increased sight radius.
A C Jones shooting for IC had
plenty of nerve for the 100 yard
stage scoring 44/50, followed-by a
200 yard score of 48/50 which put
him within three points of the
overall lead. Thinking of lunch and
glory (in that order) he suffered
from severe wind and inferior
ballistics at 300 yards finishing with
a 34/50 for a total score of 126/150.
This was sufficient for him to take
first place in the Allcomers C
section and get some glass wear -
plus a little gold thingy and a
medallion. CJ Hurr, who stayed
well clear of the beef burgers at
lunch, took advantage of a lull in
the wind to score an excellent 46/50
which was invaluable both for the
big event and the warm up London
& Middlesex Rifle Association
Open, where Jones won another
cup, and also for the practise
sessions. Hurr also made the 'flying
machine' (a combined seat and
pistol rest) that is an absolute must
for serious posing and shooting.
Our treasurer, Robert Hambleton
(the only member of the executive
who actually does anything), must
also be thanked. This years long
range escapade cost about £500.
Rob is forever greeted with a 'Oh
Rob, here's another receipt, can
you do something with it?' The
answer to this question usually
results in a yes, which fortunately
means that some cash comes back.
