Union to Fund Sports Centre Conductor Quits after Row
Imperial College Union (ICU)
could lose up to £400,000 from the
Harlington trust to fund the
proposed refurbishment of the
Imperial College Sports Centre.
The Harlington Trust was set up
in 1989 to manage the money raised
from gravel extracted from the
Harlington Playing field. The
Sports Centre changes will be
funded by an interest free loan of
£650,000 to be repaid in twelve
years time. The Union will lose
money on the interest raised on the
fund, which was as much as
£300,000 last year.
Zoe Hellinger, ICU President,
said that she and the other trustees
of the Harlington trust believed that
the money would benefit students:
They believed an improved Sports
Centre would attract better students
and provide improved sports
facilities.
Complaints have also been raised
over the closure of the whole sports
Investigations are continuing after
the theft of several items, including
£950 in cash, from rooms in
Southside Halls over two weeks
ago.
The thefts are beleived to have
occurred during or shortly after the
hall's windows had been cleaned as
afterwards it was noticed that
several rooms had been left
unlocked and the contents had been
disturbed. The thefts are still being
investigated by the Police.
Any company that is allowed into
Halls is normally vetted by College
security. Reports reaching Felix
suggest that the company employed
centre over the first term of the next
academic year. Ms Osner said that
arrangements were being made with
the University of London Union and
St Mary's to house some of IC's
sporting facilities during the
closure. She told Zoe Hellinger that
a fund would be raised to help pay
for any extra travelling costs
incurred. Other sports centres in
Kensington, Westminster, Chelsea
and Wandsworth would
accommodate Imperial students at
reduced prices. Ms Osner expressed
regret at closure but said it was
'unavoidable.'
Ms Osner continued that the
changes had been agreed with the
widest consultation possible and that
the changes to the sports centre
would be in the best interests of
students now and in the future. The
sports centre will close on the 16th
August and reopen on 2nd January
1993 following an extensive
marketing campaign.
to clean windows may have sub-
contracted the work to a third party
which avoided security checks.
The student who had £950 stolen
is believed to have had the money
in her room for up to ten days. Zoe
Hellinger, Imperial College Union
President, said she was 'very angry'
over this lapse of security and added
that any student who took 'adequate
provisions' by locking their rooms
should be entitled to some help from
College in this type of situation.
Sir Eric Ash, IC Rector, said the
situation was difficult as the College
was not responsible for all student
rooms, but said he would
investigate the matter personally.
Professor Eric Brown has resigned
as conductor of Imperial College
Choir, ending a career which
spanned about forty years. The
resignation was announced just
before the choir's concert in the
Great Hall last Friday evening, and
comes after a dispute between the
conductor and the choir's senior
treasurer, Malcolm Aldridge.
The Choir chairman, Phil Pratt,
recently issued a letter withdrawing
Mr Aldridge's membership of the
choir, following what has been
reported as an attempt by M r
Aldridge to force Professor Brown
from the conductorship.
The move by M r Pratt to
withdraw M r Aldridge's
membership was unconstitutional,
and has been withdrawn. Imperial
College Choir is a Union society
and membership must remain open
Libraries Merge
The work on merging the Imperial
College central libraries and the
Science Museum libraries will take
place over the Summer Vacation.
The combined libraries will have
one entrance, a single issue desk
and a reference desk. It is also
proposed to move the Haldane
Library to the ground floor of the
new building.
M r Richard Hall, Reader
Services Sub-Librarian, told Felix
that the library would only be closed
for up to 3 or 4 days during the
Summer holiday while the serious
work is done. He added that
although some noise would be
unavoidable during the merger, the
effect on Postgraduates and students
studying for retakes would be small.
to all Union members, including M r
Aldridge who is a life member of
the Union.
Speaking to (CNN, M r Aldridge
said that he was still 'nominally
senior treasurer' of the Choir. He
confirmed that he had received the
letter from the chairman
withdrawing his membership and
that he was now waiting to see what
the committee would decide on the
matter. He added that he would
concur with any decision made
about his membership.
Eric Brown was a professor of
Civil Engineering at Imperial until
his retirement two years ago. Sir
Eric Ash, IC Rector, told / C N N
that Professor Brown was 'an
absolutely marvellous source of
strength for music in the college.
He was an extraordinarily talented
and devoted conductor.'
Mr Hall said work on the libraries
would continue for the next two
years but the major work should be
completed before the next academic
year begins. M r Hall emphasised
that the company that wins the
contract to meld the two libraries
would have to guarantee to
complete the work over the
summer.
Sir Eric Ash, IC Rector,
commented that the merger was
something he had 'fought for, for
a long time.' Sir Eric continued that
any student affected by the building
work should take into account the
wide range of departmental
Libraries that Imperial possesses
which rival other Universities in the
country.

Students and Sabbaticals vote for Gardens Closure
The 'Gardens' Restaurant in
Southside will close completely by
the end of the term if a proposal
circulated by catering manager
Simon Westerman is passed by
College. The proposal was passed
by the College Bar and Catering
Committee on 21 May. It will be
considered by College House
Committee on 9th June, and by the
College Management Planning
Group (MPG) on 2nd July. The
M P G will then advise the Rector
and the decision making Governing
Body.
The Bar and Catering Committee
'endorsed the view that there could
be no justification in continuing
with any form of service within the
Gardens Restaurant in Southside
and recommend it should cease
trading at the end of the present
term.' The proposal was passed on
the grounds that the losses incurred
by the restaurant were
unsustainable. The two sabbatical
officers present at the meeting, Zoe
Hellinger and Steve Farrant, were
also in favour of closing the
Gardens.
In addition to his papers to Bar
and Catering, M r Westerman has
prepared a paper for the College
House Committee meeting. He
describes Gardens as always having
been 'a drain on Catering's
resources, with a projected deficit
of £180,000 for 1992. This is a
completely unsustainable situation.'
Catering Department Trading
Account figures for the nine months
to 30th April 1992 show that
Gardens made a loss of £143,402,
while the Sherfield Senior Common
Room and Main Dining Hall made
a combined loss of £192,076.
Administration cost the Catering
Department £293,645 in the nine
month period.
The House and Catering
Committee decision to completely
close Gardens follows a
consultation exercise on proposals
to close Gardens at weekends and
evenings only. 708 questionnaires
were circulated to student users,
and 121 (17%) were returned. One
hundred questionnaires were burnt.
The results of the survey were that
95% of the 17% would not be
adversely affected if the weekend
lunch service were to stop, and that
93% of the 17% would not be
adversely affected by the cessation
of the evening service.
Speaking to / C N N yesterday
afternoon, M r Westerman said he
'did not know' if another
questionnaire on the complete
closure was to be issued to students.
He added in his defence that
'student representation was 100%
in favour' at the Bar and Catering
Committee. Following last week's
Felix article on the closure of
Gardens, he said that staff had now
been notified of the proposal. He
added that staff would not have been
notified of the proposal had the
Felix article not appeared. A new
consultation document on the
proposal will be issued within the
next 24 hours.
The House and Catering
Committee also approved the
closure of Southside bar in its
present form and the movement of
the bar to the Sherfield building.
The proposed move was prompted
by 'rowdiness, isolated incidents of
violence, glasses and litter in
Princes Gardens and noise pollution
for the neighbouring community.'
The paper also proposed moving
Belushi's to Sherfield. M r
Westerman said that none of these
proposals would be implemented
until the 'Catering account moves
from red to black.'
