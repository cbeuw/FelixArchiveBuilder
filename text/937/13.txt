In the Midnight Hour
In the Midnight Hour is now on at
the Young Vic. It's a show about
soul and clubbing in the sixties. It
follows the fate of various mods and
the events of their Saturday night.
We have Cliff (Anthony Barclay)
and Dunny (Jeremy Brook).
Dunny's a bit thick but rates himself
as a smoothy and Cliff is a mildly
tormented, love stricken, soulboy.
They're out on the town, so are
Roxy (Gillian Bevan) and Rita
(Amanda Symonds). Rita's a good,
plump, catholic girl and her mate
Roxy is a bitter, hardened, soulgirl.
Everyone (virtually) is out on the
pull. Everyone (virtually) goes
home disappointed, but that's what
Saturday night is all about. I like
Roxy, she's a woman after my own
heart: Rita—"ere, Roxy, look at
them blokes'. Roxy—'Rita, mosto'
them blokes are taking a How to be
a bastard correspondence course'.
Yep, thought I. The script is full of
those elegant phrases that get
bantered around the dance floor;-
I'd give 'er one, Shut it mouth,
Drop dead creep, Beat it Bollock
brain. Luverly, as they say up
north. Their accents were so
northern it was scary. Lots of slick
deliveries of funny lines, lots of
great songs sung really well, lots of
talented musicians. The
choreography was good. Great
costumes as well; where did they
get those suits? Authenticity was
helped by them being worn in that
awkward way that defines sixties
mods.
Dancin' in the Street, Respect,
Do Right Woman, Grapevine,
Knock on Wood, Try a Little
Tenderness, Under the Board
Walk. The list of classic soul songs
is long, a little bit too long I'd say.
It's so jam packed that the story and
events are a bit slow in being
revealed. I also felt that it was
lacking a little pazzazz, but you
can't fault their commitment to the
music. I like the fact that the
scriptwriter avoided the pull into
'significance' and 'conclusiveness'.
It's a fun night at the theatre and
you are given the opportunity to get
up and dance. Neil and Glynnis
Kinnock took the chance to jive. It
was a bit tough for the performers
as it took a while for the audience
to settle down again. But they dealt
with it well,

The Celebrated City
'The Corporation of London is
older than parliament itself and it
is this corporation that governs the
square mile that is the City of
London. The Celebrated City is an
exhibition in two parts, on the one
hand there is a display of historical
documents and memorabilia from
over eight centuries of the City's
past. On the other hand the
exhibition looks at some of the
works of art that the City has
collected over the years, including
eighty-three 17th century Dutch
paintings recently bequeathed to the
City.
The first half will appeal to
anyone with a sense of history. The
displays start at the birth of the
Corporation with charters from
ancient monarchs complete with
original seals and progress through
to the current day. Along the way
there are rare maps of London,
exquisite gold and silverware,
itiitll
ceremonial treasures such as the
Crystal Sceptre and full size
paintings of past Lord Mayors. The
theme of the exhibition is the role
of the Lord Mayor and the
Government of the City.
The display of art is diverse,
ranging from traditional
impressionist paintings to modern
pastels and watercolours. There is
a staggering selection and anyone
interested in art should find
something of interest.
Throughout the exhibition I felt
that presentation could have been
enhanced to make the displays more
interesting to a wider audience. As
it is, those interested in history or
art should find some parts
fascinating.
