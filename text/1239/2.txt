this week
Editorial
To say my joy knew no bounds
would be such an understate-
ment that it would equivocate
to saying that the Pacific
Ocean is quite a large lake.
I have been reliably
informed that complaining of
my work load is not done, and
that if I do it, I should just
delete it instantly, and as
such, I'm not going to.
However, I suspect that you
can't help but notice the
rather diminutive nature of
Felix this week, and I feel that
this requires an explanation.
You see, this week all my sub
editors have got something
better to do than write, there
is no news, not to mention the
financial crisis, and of course
the alternative prospectus,
which is due at the printer's
Monday morning. A s well as
the gig that I have on Monday,
for which I know nothing, but
that's my problem, so I
shouldn't really complain.
So don't ask, basically.
This weekend, on the other
hand, is going to be a whole
bundle of laughs. Don't forget
that there is the summer ball,
which I shall certainly be
attending, and on top of that,
I'm going to be having a lot of
house guests, which would be
an incredibly good thing apart
from the fact that they're
going to be sitting around (or
possibly sleeping) in my
room, while I am forced to
work. I do love it when my
love life takes a massive turn
for the better only to be
thwarted by the publishing
business, if one can put it that
way.
I felt a large disturbance in
the force on Monday, and I
must admit that it has left me
largely shaken since then. Not
quite, admittedly, as shaken
as when I tried some Blue
WKD the other day: that left
me feeling like someone was
slowly twisting my brain
around inside my skull. But
yes, disturbance in the force it
was, and since then I have
had the feeling that some bad
things are going to happen.
A n d since then some bad
things have happened, but I
can't really believe they war-
ranted quite the feeling of
dread that washed over me.
Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I
suspect that the next editorial
I write will possibly be the
most surreal of the year.
I have been looking back at
the final issue editorials of
editors in the past, and have
noticed that many of them are
along the lines of 'Well it's the
end of an era, and I'm off to
get a job, etc' This isn't quite
the same with me, because I'll
be here next year, so I'm not
feeling even remotely nostal-
gic, but for all those final year
students out there: well done
and good luck. I, however, am
staying here in Beit Quad
where it's warm and comfort-
able. Having said that, when
my time to leave does come,
I'll probably be a gibbering
wreck when I finally emerge
blinking and gasping from the
basements like a butterfly
after its long hibernation
through the winter months,
and you can all laugh at me
then.
So to conclude (since I
have no advertising space,
and promised that I would
put this ad in), go to the
