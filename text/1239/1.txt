Summer Ball Tomorrow!
You've only got until the end of today to
buy your tickets for the Summer Ball.
Tickets have been selling fast, and the
evening looks set to be a memorable one,
with live performances from both
Comershop and the James Taylor Quartet
- who performed at last year's successful
event - as well as Imperial College's very
own Big Band, Jazz and Rock bands.
There will also be live sets from the
Scratch Perverts, the Dreem Team's Timmi
Magic, and ICU's former resident cheese-
meister Mark Home, amongst others.
Last year's funfair will be making a wel-
come return. In addition, there will also be
a 'Test Your Strength' machine and candy
floss will be available to add to the fair-
ground atmosphere of the event.
The event's organisers have been able
to negotiate discounts with various outfit-
ters enabling those wishing to go to the
event to hire suitable attire at bargain
prices; these include several stores within
the Moss Bros group, and Pegaso on
Kensington High Street.
If you have still not purchased your tick-
et for this once-in-a-year event, then they
are available from the branch of
Waterstone's on campus, the Union recep-
tion, and also in the JCR this lunchtime.
More information about this year's
event is available from the website

Oil Be Damned
Firefighters were called to
Imperial's Charing Cross cam-
pus in the early hours of Bank
Holiday Tuesday after an elec-
trical fault caused a generator
to spill diesel oil within the
hospital.
The spillage came about
after a fuse blew in the electri-
cal circuitry of an unoccupied
lab block. This caused a level
switch to malfunction which
resulted i n its failure to regu-
late the amount of diesel being
drawn into the generator.
Security officers at the campus
smelt the overflowing oil and
alerted the fire brigade, who
were able to shut down the
power to the block on their
arrival, before co-ordinating a
clear-up operation. A n on-site
engineer was able to repair the
electrical fault.
A spokesperson for the
Charing Cross campus - one of
the sites of the College's School
of Medicine - told Felix that
although early reports had
claimed that ten thousand
litres of diesel oil had escaped,
the spillage was in fact only a
minor one and that the hospi-
tal's generators are tested reg-
ularly to ensure that they are in
good working order. They
added that no-one had been
harmed or placed in danger by
the incident and that the
spillage had been cleared up
without any detrimental effect
on either the hospital's
patients or their care.
