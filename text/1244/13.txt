McAlmont and Butler
Bring It Back
3/5
Bernard Butler once of Suede has
been described in some quarters
as the best all-round guitarist
since Clapton. But he has also
been painted as the most difficult
man to work with due to the fact
that he has split with all his writ-
ing partners citing "musical differ-
ences". So after his hit and miss
solo career was put to rest he has
returned to work with other diffi-
cult artist David McAlmont who
he had a semi-successful partner-
ship with back in 1995 with sin-
gle Yes going top 10.
So have the years added more
substance to their music or are
they destined to flitter out of the
limelight again? Well, on the
strength of the first track, the
intriguingly titled "Theme From",
you hope they carry on forever as
this track that has anthem writ-
ten all over it with is luscious big
sound strings and funky beats,
mixed with hardwired guitar riffs.
This is a song that shows the
obvious potential that the duo
possess with Butler's knowledge
of merging rock and blues
together with McAlmont's ability
to write soulful tunes and unique
voice.
Unfortunately the promise of
this opening rarely resurfaces
later in the album. Only current
singles Falling and Bring it Back
show any desire to stay with the
now and not revert back to a sort
of Motown throwback tribute
band. Most of the songs follow a
similar pattern of either blues or
funk guitars and background
strings that often rise to the fore.
Then with the song in full swing
the vocals go up higher and the
guitar solos get longer to create a
cacophony of inviting sounds.
However the overall affect is to
make you think that they are try-
ing too hard to make each song
into a single.
There are exceptions, Blue for
example is a song that could
easily have been pulled from one
of Butler's solo albums and the
rather mismatched vocal range
possibly supports this idea.
Overall there is plenty to suggest
future greatness, but it needs to
all come together at the same
time and not in patches, but the
album is worth a listen for those
patches alone. Tank

Diamond Gods - Interpretations of Bowie
1/5
David Bowie: Music legend,
famous for Ziggy Stardust (Birth
and Death) recognised as one of
the greatest songwriters of all-time
and general all round weird guy.
This album is, like the man, a
mixture of the good and the down-
right incomprehensible.
It's easy to see why people
would want to cover Bowie, as he
has some of the most recognisable
and loved songs of the last centu-
ry. But its is difficult to see how
getting a bunch of has-been
singers (Buster Bloodvessel and
Hazel O'Connor) and new up and
coming acts (David Fisher) plus
some never heard of before to do
so is good music. Admittedly,
some of the tracks are quite good
but overall you get the feeling of
union bands trying to copy the
great man.
The start is quite promising with
Iva Davies & Icehouse performing
a rather haunting version of Loving
the Alien. The track is an acoustic
version with the different layers
beautifully merging into each
other to create a version possible
better then the original (well at
least on par). EN do a passable
Apollo 440 style version of Life on
Mars but it just doesn't quite work
on the whole. Blondie are repre-
sented here with their live version
of Heroes and this is pretty good,
which is what you expect of a
band of their quality. The only
sour note is the persistent spacey
like noisy that runs throughout.
Tacye's cover of The Man Who
Sold The World is worth a men-
tion only for the fact that they at
least have tried to do something
completely different, but again
their techno beats just don't work.
The album is also not helped by
the fact that two songs on here are
covered twice by different artists
the sole purpose of which seems
to be that you can compare how
bad they are. So overall this
album is not worth the effort apart
for the first song.

erly used to underline the pas-
sionate emotions of the track.
As for the usual political
angst that Jetplane Landing
seemingly love to deliver - if!
you wanna piss off your parents
by jumping around your room
with your stereo on far too loud
a volume then this is the track
for you - but if you're after
some decent and meaningful
music, look elsewhere.
I'm not saying this isn't good
music, it's just not the best
they've done and surely if
you're gonna do a job at all, you
might as well do it well

The Pattern: Nothing Of Value
Listen up! The world is
changing. T-shirts and com-
bats: Not cool. Sharp shirts and
skimpy pants: Right on! Flabby
emotional ballads about losing
your bird by the light of a sil-
very moon: Shit. But blistering
ballsy punk rock soul boogies
like this are THE shit.
It's amazing that some peo
pie get wound up when a band
gets attention like this. "Oh
really," they moan, picking up
their fifth slice of pizza while
simultaneously dusting the
crumbs from the last slice off
their beer gut, "I hate it when
bands get hyped. They're so
crap, and it's all ripped off
[insert ill-informed 60's / 70's
reference based on something
their mate told them drunk
once] anyway." "Yeah," agrees
