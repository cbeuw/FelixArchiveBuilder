Your Letters
Fresh Chaos
Hi guys,
i was just surprised to read this
week's Felix (have I missed one?),
with no mention of the near catas-
trophe on Saturday 28th
September... On that Saturday we
had about 800 freshers moving
into Halls on Princes Gardens, i.e.
about 600 cars driving into a 20-
odd space car park. This is a year-
ly nightmare as it is, but 'they'
(not too sure who to blame)
decided that it would be a good
weekend to block Exhibition Road
with a crane to bring in bulky
material to the new management
school building site, on top of
that, there was a peace protest
march heading to Hyde park,
which no staff had bothered
checking on to ask help from the
traffic police...
Luckily, in the end, everything
worked itself out as 'they' opened
a path on the side of princes gar-
dens to let cars in. The traffic &
security staff were very helpful,
wardening & reapp teams were
very efficient in helping students
moving in efficiently, and it all
actually worked out much better
organised than any previous year.
I wonder why 'they' never thought
of opening that path on princes
gardens before in all the years that
we blocked Exhibition Road our-
selves!
A Strange Portent
We received this at the beginning
of term, but haven't had a letters
page yet, as we had no others
until this week - Ed
Sir,
As an ex-pat alum, I've just
noticed that they're trying to
change our name to "Imperial
College London". What next?
"Harvard University Cambridge";
"Stanford University Palo Alto"...
That's not going to happen and
we don't need "London" in our
name either.
Nor, by the way, does anybody
give a damn that IC is part of
London University. If people want
to brandish around "London
University", then let them go to
Goldsmiths or Birkbeck.
They're trying to cure a sick ele-
phant by calling it a mouse.
They'll just end up with a sick
mouse. Changing the name does-
n't change the problem. Similarly,
changing IC's name is not going to
give it the kudos, celebrity, and
"instant-recognisability" it seeks.
This name changing mania
apparently arises from a survey
sent out to IC grads, from which
some cuckoo deduced that the
world would be instantly enlight-
ened if "they" screwed with IC's
name. Either IC has been gradu-
ating a whole bunch of elephant
doctors or the cuckoo got it wrong.
In the cuckoo's defence, asking
the wrong questions can get you
to the wrong answer. It's like ask-
ing Clinton if he cheated on his
wife.

. They
can't be serious. You want "world
renown" like MIT?" Pair up with
LSE and a first class US school
and advertise the hell out of it.
Don't change the letterhead; fire
the name-changers and hire a
world class PR firm instead.
Sincerely,

Not Fee-ling positive
Dear will,
Having moved on to study else-
where I may have no business
here. However, it sickens me to
see that foundations of Social
Democracy being attacked under-
neath our noses.
The consequences of allowing
Sir Richard Sykes to run this uni-
versity with disregard to the edu-
cation and well being of its stu-
dents will not only have conse-
quences for current and future ic
students but also for all students
over the nation. A retrograde step
to pre-war social values of educa-
tion solely for the rich is clearly
not a good thing.
We the students must NOT
stand by and allow this to happen.
If in ten years it costs £50000 to
do a degree anywhere (not just ic),
and we had done nothing to stop
it, the guilt is on our hands as well
as the Rector's. If these changes
are not stopped here at Imperial,
quickly they will become wide-
spread.
I encourage you not to hesitate
in using your positions as the stu-
dents to speak up against fee
increases and the lack of respect
for the student body. The voice on
this needs to be loud and clear
and strong:
STUDENTS MUST COME
FIRST. NO FEE INCREASE.
