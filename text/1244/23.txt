ICSM founder
ICSM 115-6 Birkbeck
The ICSM 2nd eleven strode out
onto the sunny pitches at
Cobham, confident in the knowl-
edge that they were capable of
winning this years league.
We were modelling the new kit,
with Marco and Sheriff proving
that the extra large sizes were a
valid choice. Led from the side-
lines by captain Roland Hettige,
(who devastatingly is out after a
heroic performance during this
summer's football match on tour
against Sporting Lisbon).
ICSM started the match well,
attacking and keeping the ball
deep in the opposition's half.
Notable performances from the
maverick strikers, Marco and
Johnny Hailes made the opposi-
tion defence almost cry with
embarrassment, and new signing
Rob displayed some Brazilian
style flicks to worry the Birkbeck
keeper from the starting whistle.
ICSM was rewarded after only 7
minutes after when the new fresh-
er signing 'Texan Mike' who domi-
nated the midfield with his firm
challenges and typical Texan
bravado that we've come to expect
from him, struck a shot from out-
side the box, and left the keeper
standing as the ball shot right past
him into the top corner and ICSM
went ahead.
However, while rejoicing in the
first goal of the season, we forgot
that the match had re-started, and
constant pressure on the usually
fortress-like defence of Tom Brick,
Chris Alesakis and the other star
fresher Seb Ellis, caught ICSM
unaware and Birkbeck calmly slot-
ted in an equaliser. However, the
2nd team spirit was un-fazed, and
we came straight back, and for
long periods were in control of the
midfield with the only trouble
coming from the opposition no. 7.
Due to his Goliath-like propor-
tions, he managed to provide our
defenders with a fair amount of
trouble, but Brick organised the
defence well and our keeper
Fleming pulled out the save of his
career. We scored 2 more goals
making the score 3-1, but then
Birkbeck, with the aid of their no.
7, and a few comedy errors on our
part, managed to scrape the score
back to 3-3.
ICSM started the 2nd half
strongly (after their inspiring team
talk), with another 1st year Jason
being brought on for the injured
Seb. Jason immediately proved
his worth playing a great ball to
put the goal-scoring machine
Marco Calandrini, who calmly
slotted away his 2nd goal of the
match. However, Birkbeck didn't
want to be left behind and imme-
diately scored again, making the
score 4-all. We began to detect a
pattern emerging.Things began to
get annoying as this time Birkbeck
went ahead when Fleming our
keeper, who decided to cover his
gloves in fairy liquid to keep his
hands soft and gentle, dropped
the ball to an awaiting Birkbeck
attacker, who put them ahead.
However, the ICSM spirit couldn't
be beaten down and Tom Cusack
dribbled through 5 of their play-
ers, and after receiving the ball on
the edge of the area, linked up
with the pace-machine Johnny
Hailes, and fired a shot into the
top corner making the score 5-5.
However, sheer bad-luck and a
lack of fitness overcame us at the
end, and despite all our best
efforts, we couldn't stop their no.
7 from scoring another goal.
However credit has to be given to
the lads for putting on a great dis-
play and playing well in a very
memorable match. Judging by
this first performance, the 2nds
have great potential this season.
Wye girls triumph
GKT 110-3 Wye
Sunday mornings are never a
good time to try and get eleven
girls to play football, especially
in the freezing rain where the
pitch is a two-hour drive away.
We soon found this out when the
minibus pulled in to find five
cold girls waiting. Panicked
phone calls started, as did lots of
frantic running round the village
trying to coax others from their
warm, comfy, beds.
In the last two seasons, Wye's
record has not been the most
impressive, but this season we
have roped in one of the lads to
coach us who is even willing to
come to away matches. However
this might have been only for
this match - GKT have the great
bonus of a huge bath for after
the match, and given the image
of eleven girlies in a steaming
bath we didn't wonder why he
was so willing to come.
We kicked off in the drizzle
after a crash course in keeping
for one of our last-minute addi-
tions - the only reason she decid-
ed to be goalie was the advan-
tage of trousers against the bitter
cold.
Both teams played really well
and I was particularly impressed
with the structure kept by the
GKT team and how often they
called to each other.
Wye kept up the pressure all
through the first half, with sever-
al shots on goal, and Maria man-
aged to get one in before half
time. Our coach kept us level-
headed and constantly reminded
us that we couldn't get compla-
cent even though we'd scored.
Into the second half, great play
from the Wye midfield sent a ball
up to Geraldine in front of the
goal, and she managed to send
us 2-0 up. This was followed by
another great shot from Laura
that was stopped by the GKT
keeper. Becks put our third goal
home, building on an earlier
effort in a scramble in the first
half involving almost kicking the
keeper in the head!
The defence did an excellent
job of sending the ball forward
the few times it did stray into our
half, and Rosie's shouting cer-
tainly scared off a few GKT who
tried to tackle her !
Full time and we were
amazed - our first match of the
season a win. Then off to the
much-awaited bath (keeping the
coach firmly outside) and then
down to the bar for some very
healthy beans and chips.
