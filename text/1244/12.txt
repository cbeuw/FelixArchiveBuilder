Nada Surf
Let Go
3/5
Hats off to Heavenly for another
angelic performance. Nada Surf
will make you cry, make you
laugh, make you dance around
your room and all within the
space of an hour.
As a band that have travelled
from nineties Britpop through
meaningless and bland guitar
music and have arrived at the
stage of electronica and emo-
pop, Nada Surf know what we've
all been through. They are us -
Let Go displays signs of heart-
break, loneliness, hope and
moreover, acceptance of how life
can be.
Older influences are evident in
the pounding beats of Hi-Speed
Soul. Electronic strings support a
powerful guitar presence with a
subtlety that New Order would
do well to learn from. The unde-
niably catchy chorus and ever-
building rhythmic bridges are
typical of this album.
Nada Surf are indie kids, pure
and simple, and Happy Kid dis-
plays this beautifully. "I'm just a
happy kid stuck with the heart of
a sad bloke" they explain in com-
plete honesty. This is a bitter-
sweet melody which could have
you weeping into your pillow or
dancing the night away depend-
ing on what you want to listen to
- desperately sincere lyrics or a
fast and classic melody you can't
get out of your head.
There are some tracks of pure
brilliance on this album while
others quietly slide into the
background. Songs such as No
Quick Fix and Killian's Red are
"nice" and there's not a bad
word to be said about them, but
they're not stand-out tracks and
are perhaps a sign that however
good Nada Surf are - and they
are good - they could be better.

Miss Black America
God Bless Miss Black America
4/5
They've already teased and
taunted us with the soulful yet
hard rocking singles Infinite
Chinese Box and Talk Hard but
at last our appetites can finally
be satisfied. This is an album of
a band who know what we need,
what music fans need now after
the ever-growing catalogue of
New York punk rock. This is the
music that matters and the
music that should be listened to.
So much popular music focus-
es on the hardships and down-
falls of love, and though this may
be a significant concern for
today's youth, the time has come
for the spotlight to fall on a more
imperative issue - that being the
widespread indifferent approach
to our place in the world today.
MBA are trying to lead a revolu-
tion, and they look determined to
do it in true rock 'n' roll fashion.
Stepping in the political shoes of
the Manic Street Preachers and
the punky routes of The Clash,
here are a bunch of guys who are
trying to save us from the soul-
destroying apathy of today's
youth and they're gonna have a
damn good time while they're
doing it.
Talk Hard is by far the best
track on this album. The softer
verses allow MBA to really bring
their feelings through; it's almost
heart-breaking to hear as they
desperately try to persuade us
that we can do anything we feel.
Contrasts of punky guitar
bridges, delicate melodies sup-
porting sincere lyrics and unfor-
gettable choruses really allow
the band to show their ever-
expanding talent. They are a
band of passion and self-belief
and they know how to stir the
same furious determination in
each one of us.
The closing track Montana
draws you in close with intricate
guitar arrangements and then
makes you close your eyes and
smile as the tender vocals of
Seymour Glass rise almost effort-
lessly towards a gentle yet truly
effective climax. For a band that
have been compared to punk
legends the Sex Pistols, MBA
sure know how to pull your
heart-strings when they choose
to and you'll find yourself wish-
ing this beauty of a track would
never end.
Some may consider this mas-
terpiece to be emo-punk but
please let's not diminish its sig-
nificance by labelling it in such a
way. This album has far too
much raw power, too many intel-
ligently crafted lyrics and more
importantly, too much meaning
to be hidden away in some NME-
crafted subcategory.
"And you say 'rock 'n' roll
destroys the soul?' I say, 'BITE
ME'", they screech in the open-
ing track. MBA are fed up with
the way they've been put down
all their lives and this time
there's just no stopping them.
And who'd want to? Keira
Singles
Fischerspooner - The 15th
Doing things with keyboards
that haven't been done properly
in... well, ages, frankly,
Fischerspooner's new single
has been anticipated in elec-
tronica-loving circles since
'Emerge' was released at the
beginning of the summer. 'The
15th' is a lot more laid-back
and chilled-out than 'Emerge',
but is still absolutely breathtak-
ng, with cute little moog noises
and synthesised drum beats
and almost chilling vocals over
the top. If you like electronica,
buy this. If you don't like elec-
tronica, get a taste transplant,
and then buy this.
5/5 Jess
Jetplane Landing - Els Quatre
Gats EP
After the incredible talent
that surfaced on their current
album 'Zero For Conduct' and
from the amazingly intense gigs
at this year's Carling Festival,
you would expect only the best
from Jetplane Landing. With
comparisons already being
made to At The Drive-ln and
RATM, it could be said that
they are in the making to be our
next rock and roll saviours.lt
could be, but it shouldn't.
The four tracks that make up
Els Quatre Gats lack the melod
ic structure of previous Jetplane
Landing material and seem to
contain the same political
standing of the latest Shakira
release.
Rather than the usual individ
ual and captivating style of
Jetplane Landing, this EP
seems to mimic early Seafood
material with a bit more thrash
thrown in to attract any metal
head wannabes.
My Fundamental Flow is the
better taster of how the usually
brilliant Jetplane Landing can
sound. It shows signs of a far1
deeper intellect among the
group and has some great gui-
tar arrangements that are clev-
