Virgins violated
IC Virgins 0 - 19 Herts
I thought that our massed faithful
readers would like a bit of pre-sea-
son waffle, slander and gossip so -
We went to Sandersfoot on tour,
got very drunk, played no rugby at
all and went to a really classy club.
The start of the year has been muy
interesante (just shows what level
5 Spanish does for your diction -
ed), but due to an incredibly suc-
cessful bribery attempt, I cannot
divulge all of my deepest darkest
secrets (get the pints down ya
Dapps) but i can tell you that a
certain budding romance between
a certain curly-haired fresher and
an really unattractive male rugby
player is off. Bastard.
So, to last Wednesday, with our
shockingly over-enthusiastic fresh-
ers, who also turned out to be a bit
bloody good, when we played a
pre-season friendly against Herts.
Not to say that they're all a bunch
of whining bitches, but they really
do go on, and we addressed their
usual 'issues' in full.
Aoife (said efa) and Rachel were
both outstanding, and were our
back and forward of the match
respectively, showing us all a few
of their slinky moves and proving
that they really knew what the hell
they were doing.
I'm really struggling to find any
particularly memorable moments,
other than the three tries they
sneaked past us, but there were
some crunching tackles, including
some sexy efforts from bally Ally
and new girl Priya.
Spatchy's bruise is f***ing
whoppin', so if you see her make
sure you give it a good poke. By
the way, if any of you are looking
for any tips on cooking a high
quality spatchcock chicken then
see the aforementioned, and she'll
be happy to help.
So to conclude the watch for
Shoot!
Competition continued through the
summer vacation for the Imperial
College Rifle Team. We were com-
peting in the West Kent Rifle
League Summer Short Range
Team Postal competition for the
first time. The competition is
organised into divisions containing
six teams. Each team then shoots
ten rounds, twice against each
other club in the division, and
points are awarded for a win, loss
or draw. A win would secure the
team 2 points, a draw 1 point and
no points for a loss. The other
clubs in the competition were all
non-university clubs. Teams con-
sisted of five shooters, and for each
round they had to shoot 1 ten-bull
card at 25 yards.
It was clear after the first few
rounds that one team were the
clear favourites. Team Nypro were
shooting consistently high scores,
and indeed they went on to win the
division, but not as convincingly as
one might first have thought.
IC started well, winning their
first round match. The second did
not go quite as well, however, see-
ing us beaten by Blackpool A.
Amazingly we managed a tie in the
third with City of Stoke , with both
teams getting 477 out of 500
points. Some extremely good
shooting on the part of our oppo-
nents, and some slightly below par
shooting on our part, saw IC lose
the next two rounds. However, we
did not allow ourselves to be dis-
couraged and put in some very
good scores for the next three; win-
ning rounds six and seven, and
only losing out to City of Stoke at
the second attempt by 1 point in
the eighth.
The final two rounds did not go
our way despite some good scores
by our able shooters. We finished
in 5th place, which was disap-
pointing as the middle of the table
was fairly close.
you, oh my children, the match
went well, we were pretty lush,
and the new people seem to have
added some much needed and
most certainly appreciated class to
the outfit.
So they can all get the first sec-
ond or two of their fifteen minutes
of fame they were: Alex - Chantel
look-a-like - Aleks, Rachel, Priya,
Kitty, Tanya, Jenny, Aoife and Ella.
At the other end of the age range,
slapper Beth has demanded, and
deserved to be fair, a mention for
traversing the north south divide to
watch her fave team.
And just to add to the Chris
Prothero hall of fame (see any
first's report), don't go there girls.
Ever. Need i say more? I think not.
Cheers then, and watch out for
our first league match next week,
against Surrey. We're still looking
for more people for the team, so if
