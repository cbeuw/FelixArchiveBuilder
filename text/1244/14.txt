Live Review
The Libertines
London 100 Club, Friday 4th October
5/5
The smell of anticipation is more
than apparent as we walk
through the door (or is that just
the result of a few hundred peo-
ple squeezed beneath the streets
of London?). People, it would
seem, are desperate to see what
could be one of the most exciting
British bands in the last five
years, with tickets outside the
venue selling for about three
times their original price. The
Libertines have some high stan-
dards to live up to.
But before the band has a
chance to reward the dedicated
crowd, Pearl emerge onstage
offering sweet female vocals to
soothe any heated tempers. The
music attempts to mesmerise the
crowd but the truth is that with
the buzz surrounding tonight's
headliners, this really isn't the
time or place for such delicate
melody.
It's sad to admit but without
the presence of the lead-singer's
husband - Supergrass' Danny
Glover - on drums, it looks doubt-
ful anyone would have looked up
from their pints. A tragic and
unfair oversight to make.
Finally it's time for the long-
awaited Libertines to make an
appearance. Kitted out in vintage
jackets and home-made shirts,
the lads seem somewhat unnatu-
rally calm despite the screaming
expectations of the crowd. They
pick up their instruments and get
straight down to business. And as
soon as they do, any fears of dis-
appointment from the crowd are
immediately dissolved. As that
first beat resonates through the
floor, there is no stopping the true
punk spirit behind the fresh and
frantic melodies of these four
young locals.
Up The Bracket comes second
on the setlist - an unusual place
for a band's latest single, but
that's because the boys have no
need or wish to finish with a sure
thing.
As it turns out, every track of
the set is an ingenious fusion of
energetic riffs and pure rock pas-
sion, and this little wonder is no
exception. Apart from the few at
the back gasping for water, the
whole crowd is moving - legs and
arms flying in every direction,
absolutely everyone is dancing.
The crowd tonight are up for a
good time and The Libertines are
damn well going to give them
one.
By the time the opening of
What A Waster fires up, there is
no stopping possibly one of the
greatest nights the 100 Club has
ever seen.
The recent nationwide tour has
obviously had an extremely posi-
tive effect on the band and the set
is tight, together and kicking
rock-ass. A mutter of an introduc-
tion is the only thing we hear
from frontman Peter Doherty but
the band provide enough of an
on-stage presence without the
need of witty repertoire - the
music speaks for itself.
The Libertines don't show any
danger of disappointing through-
out all of tonight's forty minute
set. The pure rock attitude and
unquestionable energy is absolute
in every member of the band and
it doesn't stop there. Onlookers
are helplessly infected with the
same dynamic stance and sud-
denly feel an impulse to become
a greater part of the experience
tonight.
As the last note of the chart hit
/ Get Along fades away, the
crowd is divided into three groups
- those who are rushing to snatch
a setlist, those fighting to grab a
Libertine and those left lying on
the floor wondering if it really was
the best gig of their lives.

said mate, running his greasy
fingers through his sad-looking
'Gallagher' barnet, "Give me
Paul Weller any day. He's so
innovative. On his last album
he had a record 17 different
Hammond organs."
Your fucking stepmother lis
tens to Coldplay, and this is a
woman who thought Art
Garfunkel was sexy. Put this on
loud next time she comes
round, throw your clothes on
the floor and leave a few lines
of talc on the dresser: you won't
regret it.

Queen Adreena - FM Doll
It's the return of Katie-Jane
and her temper tantrums.
Intense to the max, screaming
from the outset, she makes the
whole room vibrate with her
sharp crescendo and skillfully
made background noise. It's
typical ragged Queen Adreena
full frontal sonic assault, show'
ing the abandonment of their
wispier dark faerie side, which
is reminiscent of their new
album. Two minutes later, it's
more of the same with the
same vibrant energy, yet unbe-
lievably enjoyable, and energiz-
ing despite my not being able to
work out what she's saying.
Dark, subversive and metallic
fun.
