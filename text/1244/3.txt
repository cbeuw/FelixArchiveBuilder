The U C L Merger In Full
Last week, Imperial College
announced that it had been in
talks with University College
London about a possible merger.
Of primary interest is why this
merger might be going ahead.
There's no shortage to opposition
both among the staff and student
populations of the two colleges.
New University of London
While everyone was speculating
that the merger of Imperial and
University might signal the end of
affiliation to the University of
London, Imperial's Rector Sir
Richard Sykes indicated that he
wanted to form "The University of
London", despite the current exis-
tence of The University of London.
This may indicate a plan for even-
tual absorption of all London's col-
leges, or even closure of those con-
sidered unworthy to join the new
body.
Free Market
When questioned on the BBC's
Newsnight programme, Sir
Richard expressed support for the
Government's position that univer-
sities should operate in a freer
market. He also "wouldn't mind"
seeing smaller, less popular uni-
versities shutting down if they
were unable to secure the
improved funding that the new
institution, for example, will be
able to command with its
increased size.
London School of Economics
Back in 2000, Felix reported that
the College had plans for a merger
with LSE. While nothing apparent-
ly came from these talks, the
College management did admit
that LSE had been approached
about merger. Additionally, they
are also likely to charge top-up
fees alongside other colleges.
Arts Departments To Close?
Most of the immediate advantages
from merger arise from the dispos-
al of shared resources that are no
longer required, which in many
cases means staff. A source in the
University of London suggested
that UCL's humanities depart-
ments might be "phased out" in
order to focus on the scientific
Financial Pressure
It's no secret that both Imperial and
UCL have been suffering financial
problems for the past years, nor is it
denied by the College that financial
motivations are behind the plan to
merge.
Imperial College lost around
£1.6million last year but sold
around £16million of assets to off-
set the loss and improve their finan-
cial reserved. However, since the
2000 fiscal year, Imperial has tight-
ened up its finances considerably,
though the published accounts only
tell the story of Sir Richard Sykes'
first six months as Rector of
Imperial.
Conversely, University College are
"shafted" according to an account-
ant Felix asked to examine their
annual reports, who added "I
wouldn't touch them with a barge-
pole." While the accounts don't
reveal much detail about UCL's
activities, they lost £2.8million on
2000-2001's activity alone. They
also had to call in emergency over-
draft measures and have £75mil-
lion in long-term debt.
Their financial management may
be partly to blame - the amount of
money owed to them by other
organisations rose from £84m to
£100m in just one year. At the
same time, money owed to other
organisations by UCL increased
from £4million to £10million and
UCL's "cash-in-hand" all but van-
ished. Both IC and UCL lost signifi-
cant amounts of money in stock
market collapses - around 12% of
their value, in fact - but Imperial
suffered most from the devaluation
of Turbo Genset Inc. The value of
those shares is listed at £28m, but
is now worth little more than
£1.5m. If Imperial were relying on
the sale of those shares to fund any
large projects, the money has now
disappeared.
Money is doubtless the main driv-
ing force behind the merger, but can
Sir Richard work his industrial
magic on UCL's ailing finances?4W
departments which bring in the
largest research grants.
Merger Rescue
While UCL looks like it has the
most to gain from a merger, both
Imperial and UCL need some way
to secure their long-term future
(see Financial Pressure, below).
The top-up fees proposal that will
be presented to College Council on
Friday may be one way of balanc-
ing the books, but there's clearly a
problem at UCL, which is also like-
ly to charge top-up fees when the
Government approves the move
according to Chris Towler,
Directory of Strategy and
Communications.
"Critical mass" is a phrase cen-
tral to College's communications
on the merger - the combined
power of both Imperial and UCL's
attraction for research grants
should prove insurmountable.
Government Support
The Government have clearly sup-
ported the plan for merger, and
that between the University of
Manchester and UMIST. Given
that the Government's recent poli-
cy on university funding have been
less than popular with the Unions,
this may be a bad sign if the
Rector is seeking support from stu-
dents for the plan. However, con-
tacting the student body about the
merger seemed more of an after-
thought than a priority, with both
national media and College staff
informed well in advance of any
official notice from the manage-
ment by e-mail.
Student Input
With Imperial College Union focus-
ing on the proposed top-up fees, it
may be some time before some
coordinated response on the merg-
er plans comes from Beit Quad.
Certainly students have much to
lose from any potential merger,
particularly if it fails to lower the
need for extra tuition fees. The
sheer practicality of getting two
classes into the same lecture the-
atre remains a concern for stu-
dents and staff alike, though
whether staff influence will suc-
ceed where students may fail
remains to be seen. AW
