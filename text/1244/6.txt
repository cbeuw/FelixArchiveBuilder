Hmm, well if you are reading this,
it would be fair to assume that
you've read the news on the front
cover. I have to admit that usually I
don't write serious editorials, but
on a news item such as this, it
would be little more than churlish
to ignore it, and spout my usual
crap (which would be much easier
for me, let me tell you).
Usually in Felix, or at least cer-
tainly in the news sections, I try to
ensure that the amount of opinion
is kept to a minimum, and that
everything that goes in there is fact,
however in this editorial section, I
can write whatever I like, which, it
should be noticed, is not necessar-
ily what I believe.
So before I start, I would like you
all to hear my warning. I'm an
argumentative old fool, and I very
much enjoy playing the devil's
advocate. Therefore, since it is fair-
ly likely that all you here about both
of our fairly major news items will
be negative, I'm going to try give
you some balance (although that
doesn't mean I'm just going to be
positive). And what's more, I'm
going to try and do it from a stu-
dent point of view.
Oh, this should be fun. Letters of
complaint to felix@ic.ac.uk inci-
dentally.
So first of all this whole UCL
merger business. I'm not really sure
what's going on here. While, as I
have said, we have just reported
this in the news, my personal opin-
ion is that something very strange
is going on here. If this hasn't been
in discussion for years, not just a
few months, then frankly I'm the
monkey's uncle. Two months just
isn't long enough to get something
of this magnitude sorted out.
However, having said that, if it had
been going on for longer on any
serious scale, then the number of
people who would have to be
involved to perform any sensible
level of analysis would be great
enough that one of them would
have let it slip to someone, and
gossip being what it is...
So while the Rector is quite cun-
ning, he's not the sort of man who
would enter into this kind of deal
without first getting some pretty
hefty intel on the subject. So what
conclusions can we draw from
this? Well, perhaps he and Sir
Derek (chap in charge of UCL)
have enormous faith in the people
they are employing, to the extent
that they are entrusting the largest
merger in British educational histo-
ry (and possibly the world) to their
care and two months of work.
Convinced? Another option is that
the whole thing could perhaps be a
smoke screen to draw attention
away from the whole top up fees
thing, but really that seems a little
over the top, and there would prob-
ably be an easier way of doing it
that didn't involve another universi-
ty (even though they can use the
accountant, and while he pointed
out some interesting points about
sustainable sources of income (if
we hadn't sold an ice rink this year,
Imperial would be about 10 million
pounds in debt), he couldn't see
anything that led us to believe that
the College is in real trouble, and
similarly for UCL.
So that leaves us with two
options. And these are the most
likely two for me (although my eco-
nomics isn't up to much, so one of
them may be completely far
fetched). A merger of this variety is
likely to gain some interest, and if it
were to go through, it would cer-
tainly be conceivable that the

same smoke screen for the same
issue on their home turf), so that
one doesn't really ring true.
It is certainly possible that the
two colleges are in such dire finan-
cial need that a merger such as this
is the only way that they can gath-
er enough cash to extricate them-
selves from it. From the rumours
that one hears in this kind of job,
that wouldn't seem so unlikely,
apart from the fact that I have gone
through their accounts (which are
on the ic.ac.uk website, if you want
to see them yourself) with a trained
resulting university would do quite
well in the international market.
Thus in this build up before we
become this super university, with
some careful media manipulation,
it might be possible to persuade
various money-laden organisations
to give both UCL and ourselves
large lumps of cash. We then don't
merge, the world stays a happy
place where we can hate non-sci-
entists in peace, but we can do it in
the comfort of a nice big research
funding armchair. That was a clum-
sy metaphor, incidentally.
Or they actually believe it would
be good for the universities. But
that's boring.
(While I'm trying to be good, I
can't let it pass that Sir Derek is
only in charge of UCL for a couple
of months while they find a new
rector, so that might explain the
hurry, but it seems unlikely even
then that he has any particluarly
misanthropic intentions.)
So now onto Top Up Fees. I'm
not going to say too much on this
one, because I'm afraid, boys and
girls, that this is a foregone conclu-
sion. I truly believe that short of
burning down College that there is
nothing we can do to stop this one.
So you might as well live with it.
And to make it slightly easier to live
with, let me explain something
which no-one else probably will.
We get a lot of money from a
group called HEFCE, who give uni-
versities money for fun. This money
will now be used to fund bursaries
for students who really can't afford
to come here, and the idea is that
those who can afford to come here
will pay. Now this does seem to
perpetuate a class difference, but
even at the moment the statistics
of financial background at Imperial
are pretty worrying, considering the
current system is meant to give
everyone from all backgrounds a
chance to come here. So now those
who really can't afford it will be
able to come (they'll be changing
the system for assessing whether
you should be 'assisted' or not,
hopefully so it will be fair, as
opposed to the current system),
and those who can afford it will
also come. Which seems fair.
I've just done a quick calculation.
We get £60 million-ish for taught
students. At £10 500 per degree,
that pays fully for 5700 of them.
Leaving 2300 to pay the full price
(less than 30%). Not that it will
work exactly like that, of course,
becuase it's a sliding scale, but you
see my point.
And one final thing to remember:
this is not some scheme to screw
you around. Your degree may be
free to you, but it does cost money
to someone: the rest of the British
public (most of whom didn't have
the chance to go to University).
