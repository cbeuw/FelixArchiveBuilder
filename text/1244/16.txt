Ok, how annoying is it when you have all the
words to a song worked out except one line
that you cannot make out the lyrics to? Anyone
who has a habit of singing along (very badly in
my case) will treat this web site as their bible.
Every song you can think of that has ever been
released can be found on this site - although if
you manage to think of a song not here please
don't bother to tell me about it. It is really sim-
ple to use, search by lyrics or by author to find
the song you are looking for and the lyrics are
written out very plainly.
The problem with this site is the adverts,
rather a lot of them, flashing and flickering at
the edges of your screen and popping up in
their usual annoying fashion. Obviously this is
the way that the web site is funded and I think
it is worth putting up with them because of the
comprehensive nature of this site.
I don't think a song is worth listening to if
you can't sing along, forget the dance, trance,
techno rubbish if it ain't got words it ain't prop-
er music. (I will now get pulverised by the
music editors). I have ruined many good songs
by singing along to them and now I am fully
armed and extremely dangerous.
So now when you start to sing along you can
actually know the lyrics, or if an argument
starts up in a semi drunken state it can be eas-
ily sorted. We actually managed to convince
someone once that 'When a man loves a
woman' (you know the one) actually said
C a l l i n g a l l a l c o h o l i c s
Admittedly cocktails are an expensive way to
drink alcohol and expensive is often a bad idea
on a student budget. However, if you and a few
friends (supposing you have some) make an
investment into certain highly alcoholic bever-
ages and the most exciting thing you can come
up with is the classic vodka and orange then
this is a pretty good place to look for further
inspiration.
This entire website is dedicated to cocktails,
and while there are quite a few websites of this
nature, this one seems to be the easiest, most
straightforward to use.
A simple search system allows you to look
for a drink by name or by ingredient and there
are plenty of different recipes to browse
through. The website includes webtenders
weekly top 20, all time top 100 and best
drinks chart (voted for by site visitors). There is
also a comprehensive list of drinking games
some of which are not for the faint-hearted.
The Jerry Springer game involves watching an
episode and taking a shot of beer every beep,
every fight, whenever a guest comes on with a
prop, whenever someone says the name of the
show, if you get confused during the final
thought as well as many other rules resulting
in further shots. This can get rather complicat-
ed so there are much simpler, solely verbal
ones for the less well organised.
Go forth, enjoy this lovely little site that will
surely provide for all your spiritual needs
(sorry, I really apologise, very bad joke).

Ok, so it looks a little grey, but by the time
you have finished here everything will be
blurred into a great grey mess anyway.

'When a man loves a chicken', but, no longer
will this be a source of entertainment because
this web site will settle all such arguments in a
flash.

This stands for Basic Input/Output System, it
is very basic software that is built into your
computer so you can use it without a disk.
It can be found on your ROM chip (if you
look really closely - it is quite small), this
means that when there is a disk failure you
can still use things like your mouse, key-
board, screen etc. However, your RAM is
faster than your ROM (it's true, I raced them
across the office) so in many computers,
when you startup, your BIOS is copied from
your ROM to your RAM. This copying is
known as shadowing.
So three cheers for BIOS because it's good.

Oh dear it is that time again. The time where
I start typing rubbish and you stop reading. It
seems only five seconds since I was sitting
here typing last week's drivel.
Anyway, suppose I ought to say something
vaguely constructive. This week is what I
would consider the best of the cocktail recipe
web sites, after extensive research naturally.
Secondly, I present to you the ultimate karaoke
aid. So, you are making the great mistake of
having a house party, well now you can pro-
vide the lyrics to the cheesy music that will
inevitably be played at the end of the evening.
