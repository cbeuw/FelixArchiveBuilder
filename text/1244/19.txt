Welcome once again to wordy wonderland, where this week, you
have been warned, even this page is contagious. Fudge and I are
both seriously ill with lexicographic diarrhoea and spent the week-
end in bed, separately sadly, but this seems only to have increased
our snivelling and suffering. It is a good job then, maybe even a
delight, that next week's offering will come from a surprise source.
So surprising in fact that we don't know where, but you can rest
assured that suspect quality will always be the cornerstone of our
crossword compiling principles. It is with this in mind that you
should bow down in awe of all those who correctly completed last
week's grid, including the winner, Neil Marsh, Physics II.
All entries will be placed in Fudge's tombola at the end of the
year and the name drawn out will win a prize so sublimely expen-
sive as to be really, honestly, unsuitable for any self-respecting stu-
dent. To participate in this extravaganza, simply bring your
answers (and a large wad of cash to stand a chance of winning)
down to the office located in Beit Quad West Wing basement or
email them to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk. I must now go before I'm
forcibly fed free beer. MH
