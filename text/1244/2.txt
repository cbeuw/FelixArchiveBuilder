Analysis: The Top-Up
Fees Proposal
Last Wednesday there was an
Emergency General Meeting of
the Imperial College Union
Council to discuss the paper that
the Rector had produced advocat-
ing top-up fees for Imperial
Students.
At the meeting, the paper that
was to be brought to the College
Council was effectively leaked as
copies were distributed to the large
crowd of students attending Union
Council, despite being marked
"Confidential". While first reports,
even from your trusty copy of Felix,
Council's permission is just part of the authorisation required for fees
Loss Per Student
The motivation for the paper
seems to be the disparity between
the cost of educating each student,
which College claims is £10,500,
and the amount received from
• .. h a v e sfaoM that it costs!
You're costing College £2,800 per year
indicated that top-up fees of
£10,500 per year were to be intro-
duced, the paper is actually much
less specific.
Student Protest
The Emergency Council meeting
eventually evolved into an
Emergency General Meeting,
where all the students of Imperial
College are entitled to debate and
vote on the issue on the table - in
this case, how the Union should
respond to the top-up fees propos-
als. There was an unusually high
turn-out and there was an enthusi-
astic discussion, mandating the
teaches. Similar nsotts wotAl <Wbto
°
HEFCE (Higher Education Funding
Council for England) and current
tuition fees paid by students,
which total around £7,500
according to the Rector's proposal.
Few can argue that this loss,
which in fact totals around
£28million each year, has to be
met from somewhere but some do
argue that a university should
spend more on its students than
what they're explicitly given for
teaching. Indeed, in the end-of-
year accounts published by
Imperial in July 2001, there was a
real operating loss of £1 million.

Governmental support is key to College's plan
President to strongly condemn top-
up fees regardless of any conces-
sions. The meeting eventually
passed the motion that the stu-
dents should organise a protest
outside the 170 Queen's Gate,
where the Rector's proposal would
be made. As Felix went to press,
this protest was scheduled to
occur outside the residence during
Friday morning.
by selling off over £16million of
assets, which is far from a sus-
taintable source of income.
Imperial Will Not Act Alone
One of the key points restricting
the immediate introduction of top-
up fees is the caveat attached to
the end of the proposal, specifying
that Imperial College could only
afford to charge top-up fees if other
Colleges "of similar standing" were
to follow suit. It's certainly true,
however, that Imperial seems to
want to take a lead in modifying
the way in which higher education
is funded. This will doubtless go
down well with the Government,
which backs a "free market" for
universities including, presumably,
the ability for institutions to set
their own prices as well as compe-
tition for research grants and
exploitation of intellectual property.

scheme the Government has in
mind, but it's certainly possible to
imagine how the grants may be
reallocated to universities with, for
example, a lower number of stu-
dents from independent schools.
No amount
Wednesday, it seems likely that
approval will be forthcoming which
allows universities to charge top-
up fees as they see fit. Officially,
however, no statement has been
made but there is little doubt that
the Rector is sure of his ground,
given the College management's
contacts with policy-makers.
Additionally, for the numbers
presented by the Rector's paper to
add up, current funding from
HEFCE for each student must con-
tinue unchanged even after top-up
fees are introduced. This money,
claims the paper, will be used to
provide poorer students with bur-
saries to cover the extra cost of
their degree. Again, we have to
hope that the Rector has informa-
tion indicating that this will be pos-
sible under any new finance
Informed Argument
However this proposal is interpret-
ed, the Emergency Council meet-
ing stressed how the importance of
an intelligent and informed argu-
ment from the student body oppos-
ing top-up fees was vital if either
the College or Government are to
take notice. Even protest could let
College know that the students are
watching. Part of this must be the
realisation that this particular pro-
posal paves the way for, but stops
far short of, committing the College
to charge top-up fees or to set any
level. Instead, the reasons for the
release of this paper now, pre-
empting any Governmental
announcement and possibly giving
carte blanche to the Rector on
fees, are prime targets for exami-
nation by the student body. AW
