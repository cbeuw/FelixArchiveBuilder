Alex Says..
I'd love to be able to cook prop-
erly and healthily. My diet over
the last two years has consisted
mainly of ready meals, crisps,
chips, burgers, kebabs and pies.
Especially pies. They're easy to
shove in the oven and damn
tasty, but they haven't done
much for my physique.
Of course, when I came to uni-
versity, I was a great muscular
hunk of a man with biceps the
size of trees and capable of lifting
car parks. Honest. But now I'm
just a great lardy chunk of a man
with biceps the size of pencils,
and barely capable of picking up
anything much bigger than a pint
of Guinness.
I have tried to eat more health-
ily. One day I went to the super-
market, and I bought four lovely
deep-green Granny Smith apples,
five nice ripe bananas and a kilo-
gram of potatoes.
Three weeks later I threw out
four light-green apples which
now resembled the bland
"Golden Delicious" variety. I'm
sure this is how they are cultivat-
ed - if a supermarket hasn't sold
a load of their tangy, flavoursome
Granny Smiths by their Use By
date, just leave your them out in
the warehouse for a couple of
smelt as far away as Amersham.
I thought I'd scrap the fruit and
vegetables plan and decided to
concentrate on doing actual
cooking. I got "How to Cook" by
Delia Smith. She was arrogant
enough to try to tell me how to
boil an egg! Well, I tried it.
Several boxes of eggs later, I had
probably successfully cooked
Food!
weeks, and voila, a truckload of
apples with all the flavour of
soggy newspaper which you can
label "Golden Delicious".
The kilogram of potatoes was
trying unsuccessfully to pretend it
was a house plant, and, following
several letters of complaint, I
threw out the five brown mushy
bananas which could now be
enough which weren't cracked or
practically raw to finally have
some breakfast.
However, by this time it was
6pm. So I turned the page. "Egg
and Lentil Curry with Coconut
and Picked Lime". Hmm, steady
now Delia - you've devoted the
best part of a whole tree telling
us how to cook an egg and now
I'm supposed to have things like
"3 cardamom pods, crushed"
and "turmeric powder"? I thought
I was taking it seriously when I
made the special trip to buy eggs
for the first time ever, and now
you're expecting somebody who
can't cook at all to have a full
spice rack?
I think I'll stick to the pies. My
arteries may completely seize up
well before I go to pick up my
first pension payment, but at
least I'll have had 50 years of
fool-proof, reasonably tasty
British cuisine, rather trying to
perfect one of Delia's mad
recipes. And how would I cope
with becoming an old man any-
way? Old people smell funny,
watch Countdown, spend all day
complaining and have all the
strength of a particularly feeble
gerbil. Oh well, it looks like I'm
there already. Alex Warren
