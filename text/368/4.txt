THE ANNUAL Brighton
run for vintage and veteran
cars took place last Saturday.
Both 'Bo', the Guilds car,
and 'Jez' ihe RCS fire-engine
headed for Brighton with the
rest.
Jez had a series of mishaps.
First the driver fell out at a
round about and broke his arm
resulting in his residence at
Crawley General Hospital.
A reserve driver was sub-
stituted but nine miles this
side of Brighton 'Jez' broke
down and could not be coaxed
into life. The cost of repairs
is estimated at £50 plus the
cost of an ignominious tow
back to IC. It is also believed
the repairs will take until
February to complete.
'Bo' this year was not an
official entry, as due to a
surplus of applications the
entries were drawn from a
hat and 'Bo' was not amongst
them (shame!).
After an 8.45a.m. start
breakfast was 'thrown aboard-
according to plan' at West-
minster Bridge. Shortly after
this the other 'James and
Browne' in the run was passed
on Brixton Hill. Out of London
it started to rain and the
drivers got very wet and cold;
but fortified with whisky they
carried on to arrive at Brighton'
at 12.45p.m. More, they
confused several policemen
who tried to guide them to
the official finish.
No mechanical trouble
occured during the run.
However, this was due to a
quick repair job in the morning.
A sprocket for the chain
drive to the water pump had
to be replaced. The drivers
today said they were happy
with 'Bo's performance and
were 'very sorry about Jez'.

CHELLOOO!
Somewhere between Oxford
Street and Piccadilly Circus on
the day of the Great Tiddly-
Winks Race, Dave Barnes (C&G
V.P.) lost his megaphone.
Mines (the responsible party)
were subsequently offered 2. of
their Shields and 1 of their
helmets in exchange by C&C.
The exchange date was the*
set for November 5th, und",
the auspices of the Queer?.
Tower. C & G arrived on tin;-,
and assumed a position i>l
superiority at the top of tm:
steps, with their demolition
squad making preparation s
consistent with November 5.h
When Mines turned up, C&.
proceeded to blow up the
Queens Tower (with a loud
theatrical bang in a dustbin).
After shouts and hisses, the
exchange actually took place,
followed by the respective
CCU songs/chants. Sur-
prisingly enough, the whole
event finished peacefully,
with C & G shouting 'Boring'.
