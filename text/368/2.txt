YET ANOTHER 16-page issue.
God, what a nauseating pain. Articles,
features and small advertisements
seemingly flood into the FELIX office
and we simply feel duty bound to print
them all. That means more space is
required;. the production takes longer;
folding and collating takes longer.
That means nauseating pain for the
FELIX staff. In order to lessen the
burden on the staff somewhat, we are
now looking for someone, preferably
with little or no experience, who, after
a period of training, would take on the
responsibilities of Technical Manager.
The job is principally confined to
Thursdays when FELIX is (only just)
produced.
Come on, you people out there!
Surely there are some of you who get
the Thursday blues and want to get
involved in something worthwhile.
Better hurry if you want your name
engraved on the FELIX Staff Pres-
entation Pot. And surely the post-
college advantages must surely speak
for themselves.
With reference to the much talked-
about 'Chem Eng Joke?' article in the
last issue, we have received absolutely
no indication whatsoever as to who
might have been responsible, so the
whole thing may, inevitably, have to
remain a mystery. Needless to say, we
have received confirmation to the effect
that Miss Georgina Greene (Secretary to
Professor Ubbelohde who is at present
the head of the Chemical Engineering
Department) does infact ride a bicycle.
It seems that the Union General
Meeting held yesterday made more than
one person angry and disgusted due to
the large amount of time which app-
arently had to be devoted to discussion
on the motions which the Union will
be contributing to the NUS Conference
to be held at the end of this month
at Margate. It is clearly understandable
that people will become impatient when
an agenda essentially gets comm-
andeered by one set of issues. But it
is of no use to moan and groan about it.
Just try closing your eyes, holding
your breath and hope that it disappears.
It sometimes works!

Sir,
I have just read the NUS
motions in FELIX, particularly
the Northern Ireland motion,
and I wonder if it is truly the
opinions of the student body.
I most certainly do not advocate
the release of internees until
such time as Ulster has a
stable power-sharing assembly,
murderers should always be
segregated from the community,
can Ulster afford to have such
dangerous political oppor-
tunists on the loose at a time
when all forms of local
government have collapsed?
I appreciate that internment
is carried out on suspicion,
but terrorists are difficult to
catch, and they must all be
caught, if only for humanitarian
reasons. I do feel that the
living conditions in the camps
should be much improved.
Who remembers the original
civil rights movement? The
nearest to realisation that the
ideals of that movement have
come was the Tory inspired
power sharing executive,
which was supported by many
socialists, myself included.
This is why Ulster is kept out
of party politics, I therefore
object to the content of part 2,
paragraph 1, it is divisive.
Military presence is necessary
until Ulster is politically
stable. Bombs and bullets
achieve nothing except murder,
the problem must be solved by
social understanding, and the
aims of the original civil
rights movement must be
achieved.
r-as
By way of an after thought,
Enoch Powell's presence in
Ulster may be benefit us all
shouldhis careerbe prematurely
ended by an acute case of
lead poisoning, although I
would rather he just retired.

Sir,
The atmosphere in Chem.
II this year is certainly far
more relaxed. Reason — Dave
Duce, the GAYSOC ring leader
(whoops!) has left. Rumours
have it that he is continuing
his studies at Sheffield
University, where apparently
there is a more active GAYSOC
contingent. I personally
reckon he left because 95%
of our year just totally ignored
him and the other 5
% only
said the occasional 'hello'.
So glad I wasn't one of
his sort!
Yours faithfully,
'Relieved'.

Sir,
After reading last four
issues of Felix I have not yet
seen a reply to any of the
readers letters (except C G .
Dewey's which somehow
excited the printer to add few
unkind words).

If the Editors are not
interested in the subject
others who are affected can be
asked to comment, this way
surely there will be much more
contributions from student
body as a whole rather than
that of few individual in
imaginary esteemed positions
at ICU, that due to having
been in IC for so many years
are unaware of new students
and freshers difficulties, we
only need_to look through the
pages of Felix and see some
of the unhappy cases.
