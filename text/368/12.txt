ESCAPE FROM
RSMU ZOO
On a cold, grey Saturday
morning with the skies forboding
rain six 'wild' animals escaped
from a zoo in Prince Consort
Road, London SW7, commonly
known by the name of the
RSMU office. These animals
which included a wolf, a bear,
a lion, an ape and a
teddy bear, a really ferocious
and enormous creature at that,
descended upon the good
citizens of Chelsea and South
Kensington. The poor victims
were harassed, savaged, made
to crumble in paralytic laughter
and usually parted with some
of their loose change as a
result.
This money was then quite
quickly and greedily gobbled
up by the little red cans with
a white printed label around
their middle that were being
carried by the keepers of these
animals. In some cases even
by the animals themselves. All
credit for these incredible
feats must go to the teaching
of the Royal School of Mines.
Four of these creatures,
the lion, wolf, ape and teddy-
bear proceeded down Exhibition
Road making grotesque noises
and generally cavorting along
the pavement. Stupefied and
frightened tourists either
donated to the causes with
trembling fingers and a smile
or made off in the opposite
direction as fast as their feet
could carry them. The children-
on the other hand tried to
keep abreast of their paroxysms
of laughter and looked on in a
rather condescending manner,
before extracting some loot
from mum or dad to put into
the red cans.
Thus progress continued
along Sydney Street, then to
Kings Road (in the direction
of Sloane Square), down Sloane
Street (a very good hunting
ground for the ape) then up
Old Brompton Road (the
offerings to be had here were
rather exiguous) and back up
along Exhibition Road and
then finally back to the RSMU
office.
This circus parade netted
the RSMU approximately £220
towards their rag collection.
Their total to date stands at
£707.
