BLOOD
DONING

There is an appointment list on the notice board in
the Junior Common Room in College Block where you
may sign for the date and time at which you wish to
attend.
Please make an effort to support this worthwhile
cause since blood is in constant demand in our

wasted, so come along and spend half an hour for
someone else's benefit and claim your free tea and
biscuits.

donating in general should be addressed to Ian
McWalter, Elec. Eng. 709, int. 3100, or Weeks Hall

" THE INABILITY' of~: the National" Union of Students to
adequately represent the views of postgraduate students is
magnificently manifested by the case they put forward to the
•all party' enquiry into postgraduate education. The result of
their effort is reproduced.^lew.- it is paragraph 53 of the
Third Report of the Expenditure
Committee' on postgraduate
(education which was published
last December:
'53. The N.U.S. thought that
all postgraduate grants were
Inadequate and that the diff-
erence between studentships
and bursaries were unfair,
particularly in their application
to arts graduates'.
Perhaps I am being unfair:
perhaps Messrs. Jacks and
Randall did put up an excellent
case on all aspects, of postr;
graduate education and it fell,
on stony ground: perhaps the
moon is made of green cheese.
There were two, significant
conclusions reached- by the
Committee:
1) The financing of postj
graduates should be by a basic'
grant supplemented by a loan.
2) Overseas postgraduates
should pay, in tuition fees, t
h
"
p
full cost of their education
and training.
Both these suggestions, i f
implemented, would seriously
effect the financial position
of PG's and represents "a
complete reversal in the
philosophy of higher education.
The report seems to be shelved
at the moment but if its
recommendations are seriously
considered in the future PG's'
"must ensure that they are in a
much stronger position than
they are now.
The problem of PG re-
presentation at Imperial
College is particularly acute.
The student body consists of
about 40% postgraduates, and
this of course means that 40%
of Union funds come from PG's:
so what do we get for our
money? Nothing at all it seems!
Indeed, the Union seems
insidiously reticent of our very
existence. There is no Union
policy on PG's. The Union
takes no part in negotiating
demonstrating rates or working
conditions — this is left to the
various departmental PGgroups.
The biggest insult of all is
the reluctance of the Union to
give the Post Graduate Affairs
Officer a seat on its executive.
PG's represent 40% of the
Union and have no effective
voice in its running! A
disgraceful situation.
A considerable amount of
time and effort goes into
organising good representation
for PG's. Up to now this has
been done by the Post Graduate
Affairs Officer and the en-
thusiastic members of the
various departmental, groups.

THE University of London-Collegiate Counci I s report on
postgraduate demonstrating and tutoring rates (see FEUJt V
November}'should be condemned as what it is - art attempt to
preserve a pool of cheap-academic labour with London . Uni-
versity The hard work and organisation that won £2 an hour in
"many "London Corteges has
vbeeri crushed on the recom-
friendation of a CVCP Committee
on which students were not
represented.
Perhaps we should be
grateful that the new basic
rate for demonstrating (£1.50)
is tied to the lower end of
the Lecturers pay scale. The
annual increase this provides
is certainly an advance; what
PGs should fight for, however,
is an adequate basic rate.
Unless NUS or AUT are
prepared to represent PGs at
a national level it appears
that we must rely on local
organisation. The sudden
decision to institute a'
Nationally recommended basic
rate is surely not unconnected
with the long and bitter strikes
of Postgraduate students at
Edinburgh and Swansea
Universities in 1973/74.
When PGs have demonstrated
their strenght at a local level
what better than to fnstitute
a national rate over which
they have no control!
ICPGG should defend the
principle that future increments
in "the demonstrating rate
should be tied to a basic rate
ojf £2 per hour.
