The rather improved health
of the International XV took
a tum for the worse last
Saturday. With its engine only
running on thirteen cylinders
and only the forwards playing
in their correct positions, the
seemingly impossiblehappened,
when they lost to an Old
Cooperians team. The forwards,
by their own confessions,
possessed the unfittest front
five ever fielded, but despite
this they gave their all and on
practically every occasion,
pushed the opposition clean
off the ball in the tight scrums.
In this department full credit
must be given to the 'mature'
second row of Andy Clapham
and (Dv.) Ken Weale, along
with the fine efforts of Ryan
Beddoes as pack leader.
The IC team took to the
field after an hour (or more)
long coach journey and we
certainly were, by no means,
'warmed-up'. During this
period Cooperians scored two
tries. Or at least the ref.
thought they were tries, but
then he didn't know enough
rules to know any better. Thus
at half time we were trailing
8-0, but were looking forward
to playing down the slope in
the second half.
The second half saw IC
firmly embedded in the Old
Cooperians half. In fact, so
much ball was won from scrum
and line-out, that IC should
have scored many tries. In one
such situation, a line cut
only one yard short of their
line was won by IC, and Ryan
and Andy drove over for a try
which was disallowed by the
referee, despite being a
perfectly good try.
'The A's never lose —
spirit' is the phrase of the
moment, and certainly they
didn't. From a penalty attempt
close in, Rob Jones hit the
post, and by quick passing,
Jon Pitcher scored in the
corner, Rob Jones failed to
convert.
The last few minutes were
now upon us and this period,
although not producing any
further score, saw much
determined effort from the IC
team. In this category Ned
must deserve a special jjjention
for his covering and attack-
ing flair. All in all IC were
unlucky to lose to this team,
but despite this we all had a
good time afterwards with
Ryan leading the choir in the
bar. The irony of the occasion
was that the Extras had no
opposition tum up, and we
firmly believe that with fifteen
men we could have won.
Anyway next Saturday we
have arranged a game with
Belsize Park and all those
who played last week will
get a game, so plaase turn up
on Saturday, lads.

This annual event took
place at Motspur Park last
Sunday. There were five teams
entered from Imperial — two
from ICHC and one from each
of the constituent colleges.
Despite the inclement weather,
representatives of four of the
sides (RSM didn't turn up so
RES played their matches)
arriveld at the appointed hour,
to meet up with their first
shock — the water hockey was
on with swimming trunks and
flippers provided. Eventually
enough players arrived for the
tournament, to start. The
constituent college teams were
all knocked out in the first
round league matches. IC (I)
comfortably won their league
defeating Kings (I) by 2-1
with goals by Dave Lord and
Bob Middleton; RSM by 1-0 the
scorer being Trevor Clarke;
and drawing 0-0 with Royal
Halloway. IC (II) had more
trouble. After losing their
first match against UC (II) by
0-1 they turned on a devastating
display to beat Royal Dental
Hospital 2-0 with goals by
Chris Hodge and a Trevor
Clarke penalty (Yes, the
masochist did play for both
sides). Thus, we qualified on
goal average. Thanks to the
luck of the draw IC (I) had to
play IC (II) in the quarter finals
(fix shouted the crowd). Bob
Middleton soon put IC (I) ahead
but Jeh Bashar equalised from
the penalty spot just before
half time. The second half
was scoreless resulting in
IC (II) going through on short
cornajs. In the semi-finals,
Bans (I) proved too strong.
They scored an early goal and
despite exerting heavy pressure
IC could not equalise. Bans
ran out 2-0 winners by con-
verting a penalty in the second
half.
Everyone appeared to enjoy
themselves despite the weather
and special thanks must go to
Jim Marshall, Richard Cameron,
Dave Balderson, Keith
Arrowsmith, Ian Read and John
Andrews for their umpiring
Teams: IC(1) - Jim Marshall,
Keith Arrowsmith (Capt.),
Trevor Clarke, Dave Lord,
Bob Middleton, Trevor Tutu.
1C(1I) - Roger Hutson, Richard
Cameron, Trevor Clarke/Ken
Rowlings, Chris Hodge, Jeh
Bashar, John Andrews (Capt.).
Who was the b d who
asked a poor defenceless
fresher to guard the valuables
box and then left him to stand
out in a violent hailstorm
whilst he stayed in the dry
along with the rest of the team.
That is what is called devotion
to duty.
Without ever quite reaching
the heights of last Wednesday's
first half display IC comfortably
won this important league
match last Saturday. This was
a better overall team per-
formance with good displays
from everyone in the side.
Once again IC provided the
early pressure and soon
opened their account with a
good goal from Bob Middleton.
playing steadily IC scored
three more times before half
time through John (O.A.P.)
Andrews, Trevor (Superstar)
Tutu and Dave Lord, the last
one of these being a glorious
shot into the roof of the net
following a long comer. IC
maintained the pressure after
half time but did not get the
luck (ortheumpinngdecisions).
Bob Middleton added another
goal midway through the half
to ensure that IC ran out
easy 5-0 winners.
Team: Roger Hutson, Jim
