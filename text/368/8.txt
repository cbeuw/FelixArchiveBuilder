STUDIO 30
SECONDS...
STOIC (Student Television of Imperial
College) makes and transmits programmes
to the JCR College Block, the Lower
lounge Southside and the TV lounge in the
Union Building. STOIC is also responsible
for the maintenance of these sets.
Programmes are made, and transmitted
from the TV studio in the Electrical
Engineering Dept. We hire the studio and
the equipment is operated by STOIC
members.
What is involved in the making of a TV
programme? The person who initiates a
programme is the producer. He, or she, is
responsible for everything to do with
the programme except the studio prod-
uction, i.e. contacting people who are
going to participate in the programme,
booking the studio, assembling a studio
crew and finding a director. The latter is
in charge of the making of the programme
in the studio. During the recording of a
programme he decides which and what
camera shots are to be used and when,
and for example whether music is needed
or not. He also decides when the pro-
gramme is to finish. For our main news
programme, 'TOPIC, production meetings
are held in our office in the Union building
at lunchtimes on Mondays and Wednesdays.
During these meetings ideas are thrashed
out for inclusion in the next edition.
If you have any news which you think
warrants coverage please ring Int. 2853
during the above times. To cover outside
events we have our own portable camera
and videorecorder.
At the time of writing the Union colour
set is not in use. The reasons for this
are twofold. Firstly, the set has been
plagued by faults and is due to be repaired
shortly. Secondly, the relocation of the
Union Executive Office at the beginning
of term into what was the TV lounge has
necessitated the moving of the TV set and
its bracket. The latter has yet to be moved.
However, both STOIC cables and the down
lead from the aerial are in position and
hopefully it will not be long before the
set is installed and working.

sets in the Southside Halls of Residence.
However, the picture quality was so bad
that it was decided to abandon this scheme
rather than rendering a picture that was
unintelligible to the viewer. Naturally,
we are not a full time professional or-
ganization and hence we are simply unable
to produce programmes comparable in
quality, technically, artistically or
presentationwise, to those of the BBC
or ITV. However we do try!
We welcome constructive criticism on
any aspect of our programmes, a note in
Union letter rack will suffice.
We are constantly searching for ideas
for programmes, that is programmes that
you will want to watch. If you have a
practical suggestion please contact us.
Also if you are the organizer of any event
and would like to publicise on STOIC, you
have only to reach for the nearest internal
phone.
Finally, if you would like to join STOIC
come to the STOIC Union office' on
Mondays, WednesdaysorFridays lunchtimes.
