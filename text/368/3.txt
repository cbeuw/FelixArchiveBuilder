THE Australians have their Earls Court, the Arabs theirs
Queensgate and the French their South Kensington. In fact, South
Ken. with its tree-lined boulevards, open-air cafes, chic french
dress shops (ici on parle francais) and empty letter bins, might
verv well be a little corner of Paris transposed into the heart of
our dear city. If you happen to
be around at that unfortunate
moment in the afternoon when
the lycee (no us) lets loose
its contents onto the un-
suspecting public you might
very well wonder whether you
were walking down Cromwell
Road or indeed the Boulevard
St. Michel. Is it that un-
forgettable aroma of Gauloise,
black coffee and cheap french
perfume which trails behind
them that reminds you of your
last holiday in Paris? Or is
it the distinctive way they
throw their sweet papers to
the ground, the look of near
regret as they gently force you
off the pavement or the magical
sound of a foreign tongue as
they bawl at each other from
either side of the road?
For those of us at the
Institute immersed in this
other civilisation from nine
to five there is the problem of
identity, hereafter known as
identitis. This is a nasty
disease caused by foreign
bodies; it is most common
amongst those attending
foreign establishments. Early
symptoms are a forked tongue
thus enabling one to speak two
languages at the same time
(particularly useful at staff
meetings) though this does
tend to make eating more
difficult.
In fact our college must be
the only one in the country •
where the union meetings with
the staff are conducted in
french. At one particular
meeting we were discussing
the delicate problem of staff-
student relations and the
apparent lack of communication
between the two. The dis-
cussion however, became too
involved for those of us on
the union to continue in french
so we reverted to english
whilst the staff continued in
their mother tongue. However,
they were no longer too sure
what we were'talking about and
the meeting ended in the sort
of uproar that must have
reigned at the Tower of Babel.
Which all went to prove our
point.
Lack of communication
between the french lecturers
(who make up about 90% of
the staff) and the students is
THE big problem at IF.
Unfortunately, most of the
lecturers who come in have
full time jobs outside and
give only a few lectures a
week. Very rarely do they know
the other members of staff let
alone the names of their own
students. One girl recently
went to one of her lecturers
to tell her that after having
followed her course for a year
she nevertheless had decided
to give it up. The lecturer
didn't even know who she was
despite the fact that there
were only a handful of girls in
her particular group.
Moreover, some of the
lecturers show an amazing
ignorance of the day to day
British way of life. One can
easily imagine that they don't
have to say so much as a
'yes' or a 'no' from one end
of the day to the other. They
live in a french orientated
area, teach at a french es-
tablishment, work with french
organisations and send their
chiidren to the lycee. There
is nothing wrong with staying
within one's own little
community whilst abroad (and
the British know all about that)
but there is nothing com-
mendable in it either..
However, it is easy to,
generalise, and one must admit
that there are the odd few who
do take an active interest once
they have been roped into
something. We had a sur-
prising amount of co-operation
from the staff for last year's
review and for our dinner
dance, and even this term
many of the male staff have
shown amazing willing to
contribute to charity by buying
a rag mag — could those centre
pages have something to do
with it? However, it is the
day to day co-operation which
is lacking. Last year the
administration admitted that
our system of tutors, whereby
students could discuss problems
with a specific member of
staff, was badly in need of
revision. This was because
the member of staff designated
to each class was more often
than not unknown to them, and
remained so for the entire
year. When we pressed for a
system whereby the class
itself" appointed the tutor, we
little realised what we were
letting ourselves in for. The
Administration decided that
we were right, that we ought
to have a tutor with whom we
were in frequent contact, that
one hour should be set aside
every fortnight to discuss any
problems and that a room
should be made available for
the purpose, and woe betide
you if you don't have any
problems! So now, whether
we like it or not, we have to
attend a 'discussion class'
every fortnight regardless of
whether any problems have
arisen or not. Unfortunately
problems do not crop up so
conveniently, and even when
they do, given a fortnight's
delay they lose their sense of
urgency. This system is less
than useless. The discussion

hails from the United States,
(though there is little trace
of an accent) and is at the
moment engaged in laborious
third year studies in the
Department of Mechanical
Engineering. She is hoping
to promote some interest in
the art of making small items
of silver jewellery by trying
to start a Jewellery Soc.
We wish her the best of luck!

hour just becomes a general
grouse hour. But there seems
little alternative. Our lecturers
are rarely at the Institute, they
are highly qualified, con-
sequently their time is precious,
and if they are to act as tutors
a certain amount of time must
be set aside for this purpose
for which they are paid.
However, the Administration
should not be surprised at the
lack of support this scheme
has so far aroused.
IF's theatre visit last week
proved to be a most interesting
experience. The theatrical
masterpiece in question was
the 'Rocky Horror Show'. If
one may judge by the ex-
pressions on people's faces
as they came out one might,
wonder how they managed to
stay in their seats to the
bitter end (we didn't). Much
squirming was in evidence and
laughter was of the em-
barrassed variety. If you do
like to see sheer unadulterated
porn put to music then this
is for you. Personally I found
it most distasteful, so I suppose
it's back to the draw.ing board
and Mary Poppins.
