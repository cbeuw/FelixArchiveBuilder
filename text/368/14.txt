Following the recent successes over UC and St." Edmund Hall,
IC 1st XI last Wednesday travelled to North London to play Royal
Free Hospital in a London University League Match. In a game
that never saw our team in difficulty, the lads eventually managed
to put away 6 goals withoHt reply. K.Senkin was the outstanding
figure in the IC side with his
R U G B Y
herculean efforts up front being'
rewarded by him scoring a fine
hat-trick. On the same day
the Seconds played the.Thirds
in the League and this 'derby'
lived up to its expectations
in every aspect. The Third
team, true to form, out played
their seniors on the day and
triumphed by the odd goal in
five so making it three wins
out of their last four matches
with the Seconds.
The game itself started
briskly and evenly with neither
side really being allowed to
settle down. An early mistake
by A.Roberts gave the Thirds
the lead they wanted and with
the Second's defence still
recovering from the shock of
being one behind the Thirds
ran in another. The mercurial
Steve Gee, always looking
dangerous up front, pulled
back two goals from the
Second team making it 2 each
at haft time. The second half
saw a grim struggle between
the Second team forwards and
the Third team defence, but
the gallant play by centrebacks
Hunter and T.Jones proved
too much even for the skill
and enterprise of M.Clark and
T.Lindon who combined well.
J.Pedley added the finishing
touches by heading a splendid
last minute goal.
On Saturday the 1st XI
gained their fourth successive
victory when they defeated
QEC by the convincing margin
of 4 goals to 1. Andy Baker
had a good game in midfield
and the uncompromising play
of our back four gave QEC
forwards little joy. This game,
however, will surely be
remembered by the two
memorable goals scored by
Glen Swaby, both outstanding
individual efforts.
The Second's scored an
impressive victory over LSE
Seconds, 3-1, while the
Thirds again making use of a
last minute goal drew 3-3
with QEC IPs. . I.Ponton,
A.Goody and fitness fanatic
J.Hargreaves scored the goals
for the Third's. The Fifth's
were the only club side to
lose on that day, going down
2-0 against Royal Holloway
Seconds.
One final note, we are
desperately short of GOAL-
KEEPERS and REFEREES.
Referees are paid £1.75 or
£1.25 depending onqualification

Putting aside our disappointing result of the previous Saturday,
IC turned on a scintillating display of hockey skills last Wednesday.
Our unlucky opponents were the firey City University side.
Straight from the bully off IC attacked with great skill and totally
overwhelmed City. Goals were bound to come and soon the rout
started. Despite some brilliant
goalkeeping," IC found them-
selves 4-0 ahead at half time,
thanks to goals from Bob
Middleton (2), Dave 'Scorcher'
Lord and Trevor 'Superstar'
Tutu, r Unfortunately, IC
slackened off in the second
half and allowed City to come
back into the game. The IC
defence proved at times to be
fragile and defensive errors
allowed City to score twice.
At this stage the match was
very evenly Balanced, but a
brilliant goal by Jeh 'Sleepy'
Bashar allowed IC to regain
some of the initiative and
although City scored again,
IC ran out easy 5-3 winners.
Team: Roger Hutson, Jim
Marshall, Richard Cameron,

IC took 'the scenic route North to Bedford on Saturday 2nd
November to play an extremely strong Bedford Wanderers team;
The attitude of the players was one of somfe resolve but a distinct
feeling of awe and lack of confidence could be felt.
The match was very slow in gaining impetus and it was some
ten minutes before the first
real encounters began by
which time the score was
3 points all. Finney had
converted an excellent penalty
goal from wide out. During
this first half Bedford were
playing down the slope and
this was a definite help to them
in sustaining territorial
advantage. At this stage
Bedford were slightly on top,
and from two set moves tries
were scored by them near the
IC posts. Both moves involved
an inside thrust the first
after a scissors and on both
occasions the IC defence was
caught flat-footed.
During this half the IC
forwards were growing in
confidence and eventually
realised that with a bit more
work they would gain the
upper hand. Lipscombe at
the front of the lineout showed
controlled aggression and won
much of the ball thrown to
this position.
At the middle of the lineout
Booth was under much pressure
as Bedford had a lineout
jumper at both the fourth and
fifth positions. Much can be
said for his efforts though
as he consistently won his own
ball and Bedford eventually
resorted to throwing to the
front where Lipscombe in turn
was dominating.
The scrummage was also
dominated by IC with Hart and
Bradley proving strong scrum-
magers and hard workers and
Austin at hooker easily winning
his own ball and getting some
against the herd.
Several scoring chances
had been unluckily squandered
by IC during this first half and
it was a travesty of justice
when half time arrived with
the score at 15-3.
The second half was one
to break the heart of any IC
supporter. The forward
dominance was completed with
IC coming out on top in every
phase. The forward rush was
well exploited and Sergot
completed several thrusting
runs up the centre of the pitch.
Several promising three-
quarter movements broke down
at the vital stage but this did
not stop Williams on the right-
wing having an outstanding
second half. In fact it was
Bedford who scored all the
points from a goal, a try and
a penalty goal. The final
score was 28-3.
The match did much to
establish confidence in the
IC side and as soon as a
defensive system can be'
wonted out this IC side will
indeed be a team to be
reckoned with. Every member
is looking expectantly towards
next Saturday when we entertain
Harlequins 'A' at Harlington.
Team: B.Finney, R.Stern,
D.Shakesheff, A.Williams,

IC Vvc
IC undertook their first epic
of the season against UC at
Harlington on Wednesday 30th,
October. With any luck it could
be the last as fate has been
kind and not pitched us to-
gether in the Gulteridge Cup
this year. We can also only
hope that the groundsman at
Shenley will continue with his
present attitude to our glorious
club.
The match followed the
familiar-pattern of the last ten
(at least) encounters. Complete
forward domination by IC was
met by the ultimate UC answer-
spoiling. They have bred the
best' spoilers imaginable with
forwards blatantly off side in
ruck and maul and backs
constantly infringing the
various off side lines.
IC started with a bang from
a Finney penalty and a brilliant
individual try by Bradley which
was goaled by Finney. But
from then until the end, IC
were continually fouled up by
the UC defence, the match
being too close for comfort
points-wise for most of the
game. Finney struck another
penalty and Cresswell scored
an unconverted try during the
dying minutes. The final score
was 16-3.
