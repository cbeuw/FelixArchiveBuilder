The NUS have given per-
mission for Keele Students
Union to take out a High Court
Order to restrain the University
from increasing rents. The
Union claims that in putting
pip the fees for some self-
contained flats from £155 to
£205, the University is
contravening the government
freeze on rents, and should be
subject to the same restrictions
as any private landlord.
CAMBRIDGE
The proposed building of
a new college (Robinson
College) has provoked a strong
reaction from Cambridge
students. They regard it as
an unnecessary expense which
would be detrimental to the
environment in the area where
the college would be built and
an uncertain gain for the loss
of student dwellings its
construction would entail.
For the first time ever the
Vice Chancellor has agreed to
tmeet student representatives
ito discuss the matter.
EDINBURGH
Some 50 Edinburgh students
have occupied a second house
in the city to draw attention
to the plight of students left
without accommodation at
the start of term. The house,
which is normally used by the
University for administrative
offices has been empty for
more than a year. An earlier
occupation saw 60 students
take over a house formerly
used by the Principal for
entertaining prominent guests
to the University. The Students
Representative Council claims
that 250 students are without
accommodation. The University
authorities have refused to
comment.

RELATIVITY THEORY has given a new insight into the
fundamental phenomena of the Universe. The exact and eternal
truths of Greek Philosophy with its three co-ordinate space and
uniform, unidirectional flow of
four dimensional space-time,
probability. Time has become
integrated with three co-
ordinate space and loses its
separate identity. A new
co-ordinate system, which
depends on the position of the
observer for its description,
is produced.
The linguistic and con-
ceptual difficulties inherent
in relativity theory makes
attractive the possibility that
its conclusion have already
been expounded in a somewhat
different context by the
Eastern mystics. Thus, although
geometry was used to good
effect in the East, it was
regarded as a I imitive extension
of the mind. The ancient texts
refer to the interpenetration
time have been supplanted by
curved space and statistical
of space and time and the
higher centres of consciousness
with their eternal present.
Whether or not the objective
basis of relativity theory and
the subjective basis of Eastern
mysticism lead to the same
philosophical interpretation of
the Universe is difficult to
ascertain on the superficial
comparisonavailableat present.
A further development of this
line of thought seems likely
in the future.
Fritjof Capra is writing a
book, 'The Tao of Physics'
(to be published by Wildwood
House, London in 1975), upon
which his lectures were
based.
