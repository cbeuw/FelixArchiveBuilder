TOUCHSTONE
The Influence of Politics
on Technology
Speaker: Paul Johnson
P a u l E k p e n y o n g
THE FIRST Touchstone weekend took place last weekend at
Silwood Park. We left IC on Saturday afternoon by coach at
approximately 2.20p.m. from Beit Archway and arrived at Silwood
about 3.30p.m. We then deposited our overnight bags in the huts
where we were to sleep and proceeded to tea.
This was followed by the
lecture given by Mr Paul
Johnson, ex-editor of The New
Statesman (he now devotes
most of his time to writing and
is the author of The Offshore
Islanders, Journey into Chaos,
etc) on 'The Influence of
Politics on Technology'. This
lasted for an hour and was
essentially an historical out-
line of instances where
political motive was the
instigator of technological
advancement, whereupon an
insurgent discussion followed.
We adjourned for sherry and
then savoured the appetising
Silwood cuisine.
The participants then
divided into three groups to
discuss five questions posed
by Paul Johnson, viz:
1) Should Government try to
influence the development of
technology?
2) If so, what is the best way?
3) Is technology likely to
flourish more successfully in
a democratic or a non-
democratic society?
4) Should Government be more
preoccupied with theoretical
science, advanced technology
or intermediate technology?
5) What role should scientists
and technologists play in
Government?
A general consensus of opinion
within each group was app-
ropiated to be presented at
full session the following
day. A piss-up (on one pint!?)
then followed.
We staggered out of bed in
an intellectual stupor and
gropped our way to the dining
hall for breakfast. Those of
us who could brave the stormy
weather went out for a walk,
while the sensible people
followed such intellectual
pastimes as snooker, bridge
and darts.
Everyone paid a visit to
'The Canon Inn' prior to lunch.
A final meeting of all those
attending was held, whence
the scribers from each sub-
group presented their reports.
Mr. Johnson then, summed up
on all the reports with more
questions from the floor and
thus ending an intellectually
stimulating and enjoyable
weekend.
The following five replies
represents fairly the outcome
of the debate on the questions
set:
1) The Government should
influence the development of
technology in one way or
another.
2) The Government should
allocate funds for theoretical
science research and leave
the choice of field of research
to the scientists concerned.
The accent now should be on
advanced technology for this
country. For the third world
countries intermediate tec-
hnology should be given
priority. It is also noted that
this field of research has to
date received little attention
and is under estimated.
3) The speaker failed to agree
that there was no distinction
between democratic and non-
democratic governments in the
way research is followed
through. The general feeling
amongst the group being that
efficiency was more likely in
a non-democratic state since
whatever project they were
likely to research into would
be bulldozed through in no
uncertain manner.
4) The choice of the field of
investigation is up to in-
dividual governments which
is limited by the amount of
capital they possess.
5) The group felt that scientists
and technologists should have
only a consultative role in
government. The speaker
thought that there was a strong
case for representation of
scientists and technologists
in the cabinet. They should be
more involved in the decision
making process, i.e. be in an
executive position. But, he
noted the fact that scientists
and technologists in general
were not interested in politics,
and tend to leave all decision
making to politicians. They
tended to behave like the
forces, in the way that they
contract out of politics. They
are out of touch with the
political situation in general.
The speaker conceded that any
scientist who entered politics
and in so doing relinquished
his scientific research could
no longer be classed as a
scientist.
