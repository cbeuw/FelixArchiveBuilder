FOUNDED IN 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION F R E E !
No. 368 FRIDAY, 8th NOVEMBER, 1974.
THE PRATT REPORT
ON TUESDAY night an emergency council meeting was held
to discuss the Pratt Report. This is the report of a working
party set up in March to advise the Rector on the use of college
facilities by outside bodies.
Council accepted much of
the report as it was the kind
of policy that the Union have
been seeking to have im-
plemented for some time.
Council agreed normal college
use of all facilities must have
first priority and sought
confirmation this would include
bookings by Union clubs and
members of college. To
facilitate this it was proposed
that outside day bookings be
definately fixed not more than
six months in advance. The
recommendation that college
strengthen links with the local
community was welcomed,
provided this meant all levels
of the community.
Especially welcomed was
the recommendation that Post-
graduate students should be
allowed to remain in residence
in halls all year.
The main point discussed
by council was the recom-
mendation of the appointment
of a Domestic Secretary who
would co-ordinate bookings,
buildings, refectories,
residence anddomesticmatters.
Managers in each field would
be responsible to him. Council
felt that one person should
not have so much power. It
recommended that a small
executive committee be set up
under Chairmanship of the
Domestic Secretary, to exercise
the major decision making
functions.

SIX WOMEN were arrested
outside the US Embassy in
Grosvenor Square last week
during a demonstration in
protest of the sentence imposed
on a woman in America for
shooting a man who raped her.
Inez Garcia had been
sentenced by a California
Court to between five years
and life. Ms Garcia is appealing
against conviction and
sentence.
In London police had
asked the 25 women who were
demonstrating on a wide
pavement in front of the US
Embassy to move to a narrower
pavement across the road,
'an they were causing an
obstruction'. In reality this
was to preserve the dignity
of the Embassy. Six women
refused to cross and were
arrested.
One woman reported that
what made them especially
angry was the Chief Inspector,
on being told the group was a
collective and had no leaders,
pointed to one of the women
and said 'You're the prettiest
girl â€” I'll talk to you'.
Nice one Cyril!
STUDENTS have been occupying Liverpool Polytechnic for
20 days this Friday, and as yet there have been no concessions
from the Poly Governors.
About 50 students moved
into Polytechnic premises
after a Uiion general meeting
on October 17th, and have
since been refusing admission
to all academic and non-
academic staff.
The students have laid six
main demands before the
Governors: The Governors
should
1. take action to improve the
student housing situation
2. reverse a 15% price increase
in catering charges
3. inject money into Union
Funds by pressing for a larger'
per capita subscription from
local authorities
4. not continue with a proposed
33% increase in hall rents in
January
5. provide a nursery
6. improve the communal
facilities of the polytechnic.
A spokesman said 'we
chose these six demands but
we are really drawing attention
to Education expenditure
cutbacks as a whole'. A further
point in contension if the
Delany Report which re-
commended a lower staff to
student ratio. The Union
oppose this, not least as it
would make 150 staff redundant.
Union President Steve
Byers said 'Many students
have become completely
disillusioned with the power
structure of the Polytechnic,
which gives the students 2
votes out of 37 votes on the
Board of Governors and 2 voles
out of 45 on the Academic
Board. I believe that most
students have now realised
that if they operate through
the committee structure of
Polytechnic they can get
nothing done. Therefore, we
are forced into taking direct
action'.
This is the second time in
a year that Poly students, who
for the most part subsist on
lower grants than University
students, have occupied
premises at the Poly. In
November 1973, students took
over the main administration
centre until the Governors
promised to take action. The
present occupation is of a
building which supplies paper
for all administrative blocks
Further action is planned
for next week with a 24 hour
work-in at three art colleges
within the Polytechnic. On
Wednesday there will be a
mass picket outside the local
Education Authority Offices
No information is available
today on this Thursday's
Governors Finance Meeting
which has these events on
its agenda.
