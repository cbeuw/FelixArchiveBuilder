The Ents Article - NOT!
Wow, and hello to you shrny happy
people out there!! Stop!! Before you
vanish into exam land to join the
party poopers, the ever saucy Ents
crew want to sizzle your brains with
more rhythm-based madness.
This Friday, the Union building
plays host to the world famous
Suedehead, the only band to be
described by N M E as 'an ambient
headcharge of frustrated easy
listening'. Playing a blissed out
fusion of burning dinner jazz with
Mantovani-esque overtones, this
beat combo have never shied away
from publicity. The multi media
coverage of their Vomit-o-thon for
Children in Need, raised loads of
wonga and the gorge of the ever-
lovely Terrance of Wogan.
Serious Hat on, so listen up and
pay attention at the back! The door
price is £10 before 10 o'clock and
£20 afterwards, so get there early
because there is a strict no
readmission policy so no sneaking
out for a drink in Southside.
Anyone smoking anything will have
it confiscated so we get a load on
the cheap. You have been warned!!!
The bar opens with a new 'Harpy
Hour' where we import the finest
young ladies from Earl's Court
Road to satiate the lusts of our
handsome, but hormonally-
challenged rugby team. Cheap
drinks 'til ten too, so get there early
and waste your grant cheque before
the term has begun!!
Don't forget the regular
Wednesday evening 'Lacklustre'
disco. It's party time and it's totally
free, well until we start charging for
it anyway. Incidentally, what do we
do with all that money you pay on
Friday night to drink in your own
bar? By the way, we had an
excellent time on the Ents trip to
France before Easter, just thought
you would like to know.
Extra Ents Entertainments for
later in the term include: Live Sex
Show with the Whitechapel
Housewives Dance troupe,
Abracadabra, the last man on earth
to pull a rabbit out of a hat for a
living, Mutilation Xtravaganza,
witness a live snuff movie recorded
Ian Wright reckons..
G U N d o w n t o
Da Vinci's in the Union
o n
Saturday 15th May
for the FA Cup Final
in the Ents Lounge, starring Carnal
Ken, Chopper Hamilton and Lydia
'Razorwire' O'Gore, come along
and participate in sextorture and
boardgames. Finally, Long John
Macoute will be doing a live
'noughts and crosses' challenge in
the Union Dining Hall, so you
budding champions of 'noughts and
crosses', pick up your biros, pick
your noses, and get on down to the
UDHH
And that's it for another year for
the sparsely-brained Ents collective,
but we can't go without thanking a
couple of people: Mandy Hurford,
for help and encouragement, Chris
Davidson for understanding,
Anyone wearing lycra who has
made our days just that little bit
brighter, Dominic Wilkinson who
has always inspired us when we
were down, been a shoulder to cry
on, a helping hand through the
stormy days and unstoppable force
of inspiration. Finally a big thank
you to anyone else who knows us,
Bye, Bye!!!!!!!
