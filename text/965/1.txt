Changes at
Imperial
College Union
On Monday radical changes to the
structure of Imperial College Union
(ICU) will be proposed at a meeting
of the student Union's most
powerful body.
Restructing ICU has been a goal
of ICU President Chris Davidson
sice the beginning of his term of
office. From the start of 1993 the
opinions of students at Imperial
have been canvassed in a series of
focus groups. Mr Davidson recently
granted leave by I C U Council to
investigate solutions to the problems
raised by these focus groups.
Over Easter a working party of
five people was set up by M r
Davidson to discuss and propose
changes to I C U structure. On
Monday their recommendations for
change will be put before ICU
Council. The general outline of
these proposals have been generally
leaked and members of council have
been lobbied over the past week for
their opinions on the changes.
At present ICU is responsible to
a Union General Meeting of all
students held once a term.
Management of the Union is run by
ICU Council which meets once a
month, with day to day running
decided by Sabbaticals and
Constituent College Union (CCU)
Presidents. Council contains fifty
five representative from most
sections of the Union's activities:
Departmental Representatives,
C C U Presidents, Major and Minor
Sub Committee Chairmen for Clubs
and Societies to have a voice,
Welfare and Academic
Representatives will also sit on the
new body.
In principle, the proposals
recommend the abolition of I C U
Council to be replaced by a thirteen
or fourteen man Executive
committee. This committee would
have power for the running of the
Union with each member
representing the views of an area of
the students union to the executive.
All positions on the executive wold
be made up from currently existing
posts.
The members of the proposed
executive would be: President,
responsible for Union staff and
representation, Hon Sec, looking
after all clubs and societies,
Overseas Student member, Post
Graduate Affairs Officer, Academic
Affairs Officer, Welfare Officer,
Communications Officer, Deputy
President and the four Presidents of
the Constituent College Unions: St
Mary's, City and Guilds, Royal
School of Mines and the Royal
College of Science.
Mr Davidson does not expect the
plans to be approved in full by
Council. Alterations will be made
over the next few weeks so that a
proposal can be made on the Annual
General Meeting on 23rd June. If
this successful then the changes will
have to be approved by the
Governing Body of Imperial
College before they are
implemented.

Balls to the Wall
Poor ticket sales threaten to wreck
this year's May Balls at Imperial.
As Felix goes to press on Thursday
afternoon, members of the City and
Guilds Union (C&GU) executive
are meeting to decide the fate of the
C & G U Ball. It is widely expected
that the ball will be cancelled.
Any C & G U May Ball
cancellation would follow last
Friday's decision by the Royal
College of Science Union (RCSU)
to cancel the RCSU May Ball. This
is the third cancellation of a major
function by the RCSU in twelve
months. Last year's RCSU May
Ball was cancelled after the
'withdrawal' of the Capital 95.8FM
roadshow, and in January of this
year, the RCSU Annual Dinner was
scrapped after poor ticket sales.
Kate Dalton, C & G U President,
described the situation as
'unfortunate', but declined to give
a reason for the lack of sales. This
year's tickets retail at a lower price
than last year. The RCSU were
charging £50 per double ticket and
£30 per single, while the C & G U are
charging £45 per double and £25
per single ticket.
