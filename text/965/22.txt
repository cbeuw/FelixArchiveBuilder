Cricket 1 st XI take two .. .and 2nds Stuff Kings
IC 1st Cricket vs Kings College
London and vs Brunei University
IC 1st XI got off to an outstanding
start in their quest for the
Commercial Union U A U
Championships, beating both
King's and Brunei by over 100
runs.
Although the top order have yet
to find their form, IC have
demonstrated all round batting
depth, a fighting spirit, and a
'never-say-die' attitude, while the
bowling and fielding have
mesmerised the opposition.
In the game against Kings, IC

Wobblers again
were rescued by a 'quite literally
breathtaking' innings by Andy
Jones, whose 99 off only 76 balls
propelled IC to an unsurmountable
total of 238-9. King's were then
rapidly dismissed for 130 by a solid
bowling performance.
Against Brunei, IC struggled to
an 81 for 8 at lunch, before a superb
partnership of 115 between Steve
Blyth (70) and James Diss (26 n.o.)
stunned the Brunei attack. IC
finished on 195 for 9 and then
skittled a demoralised Brunei side
for a mere 61, Dafydd Owen taking
a 'Gus-Logietastic' five catches at
short-leg.

Once again, nay for the last time my
dappled hand draws the steel nib
across the page. Oh yes, it is the last
Imperial College Hockey Report of
the year. A n opportunity to tell all
you lovely people about our
exploits.
For the record, here are the

Henry Ford is reputed to have
said, satisfies are bunk. Disguised
under that seemingly innocuous set
of numbers hides a most amazing
fact. For the first time since who
knows when, Imperial College
Men's 1st XI Hockey team won
something. The University of
London Cup is our proud
possession, or at least it shall be
when they get around to giving it
to us (only two months late).
As well as being the highlight of
our year, the Cup run was the
golden strand sown through the
season. Our victims to reach the
final included Kings College, who
we hadn't beaten since anyone
could remember, and a very tight
game against the Medic types of
UMDS. In those games we played
as well as any IC team I've seen in
three years. The final of course was
the marshmallow fairy astride our
victory cake. Royal Holloway had
humiliated us prettv regularly in
U A U and London League fixtures
over the years. 5-1 had been a
popular score as well. Yet despite
their training schedules and rolling
substitutes, we made short work of
them scoring three goals in ten
frantic minutes. Final score 3-1.
The other parts of the season
were workmanlike; an equal
mixture of good and bad. Hari-Kari
was the order of the day in the
U A U . After credible performances
against Reading, Brunei and Kings,
we threw it all away losing to
Charing Cross on grass in a game
where we weren't sure who was
playing where. The London League
looked good for a time, until we
played an out of form U C L side and
lost 5-3. The four counties Saturday
League produced many a laugh but
little in the way of results.
Memorable amongst the former
were the forgetfulness of a certain
goalkeeper and a bad succession of
9 man teams. In the end we did
about as well as usual coming 11th
of 15 teams. League reorganisation
On a dull and overcast Wednesday
morning, the IC Cricket 2nd XI set
out to Harlington to play Kings
College in the Commercial Union
U A U Championships. Eventually
the opposition arrived and the toss
was taken, which IC lost and Kings
elected to bat.
The wicket proved treacherous
for the opening pair but they
bravely batted on with ball after ball
flying past their ears. Eventually
Kings got a breakthrough by
dismissing Mustafa Hussain off a
good length ball. This signalled the
arrival of the Man-of-the-Match
Steve Blythe who smashed his
second delivery for a glorious 6 and
went onto score an impressive 66.
Everyone contributed to the
eventual score of 194 (not a bad
effort on such a wicket).
By the time Kings came to bat,
the sun had come out and the pitch
had dried. The opposition had an air
of confidence about them but they
had not counted on the lightning
pace of our opening bowlers. Manni
Manimaara and Zulfi Hassan.
Manni took a wicket in just the 2nd
over off one of the worst balls you
are ever likely to see. However with
continued tight bowling the visitors
were struggling, well below the
required run-rate, by tea.
On resumption, fine bowling
spells from Jawwad Darr, Dave
Phillips and Ed Holme signalled
trouble for Kings. With only 6
overs to go 60 runs were required
and only 1 wicket remained. Off the
bowling of Ed the last batsman got
an outside edge which sent the ball
so high that it almost went into
orbit. Running backwards Stuart
Hill pulled off an amazing one-
handed catch securing victory for
IC. We had lost the toss but had
stuffed the opposition by 57 runs.
This was an impressive start to the
season with fine team performance
and some notable ones by certain
individuals.
Well done to everyone and here's
to many more victories and many
more jugs of beer!

means we might go down.
Still in a year that started out
being a 'Help! Where's my team'
situation, we were pretty
impressible at times. The heart of
last year's team had left (6 players)
but somehow the gaps were filled
by new players, legends created and
barnames bestowed. Credit and
mention must go to leading scorer
Dave Fairhurst with 16 goals, most
in the latter half of the season. Only
Dave leaves for sunny climes at the
end of the year, so next season
greater things may happen. The
Right Honourable Edward Spence
Penford Esquire will lead the merry
men to future glory. We wish him
well.
As promised last term,
'Backtracking' will be a regular
feature in the sports pages giving all
the teams the chance to fill in on the
gory details that we could not print
last term. Meanwhile the Cricket
season is under way and we will try
to get as up to date on that as we
can, as soon as possible.
Apologies for last week's Felix,
but you survived without us (the
Sports page) so never mind.
