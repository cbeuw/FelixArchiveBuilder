the sixties? He felt that the leading
figures of that era were more clear
cut, there was a feeling of society
that does not exist today. More
importantly, that this feeling was
more worthy than the splinters that
exist now.
There is no problem in existing
information destroying that image:
Nixon, Kennedy, Cuba, Vietnam,
Czechoslovakia, Cyprus, Student
Riots in Paris, Shooting of Martin
Luther King, J Edgar Hoover, the
fact that Mick Jagger is older than |
John Major and Cilia Black was -
around then too. OK, so my f-
argumentative companion likes to I
look back at his youth with rose-
tinted spectacles, but he still has a
point. How did these people achieve
the place in history they occupy,
and what does it say about us?
In my opinion the hippy
movement of the sixties could never
recur, we have become much too
cynical. The crazes that sweep the
nation are designed for the very
young and are quickly forgotten.
Rebellion has become
institutionalised in music and
politics. More people go to
concerts, no one dances in the
street, mass demonstrations are no
longer vogue, quiet lobbying is the
order of the day. So have all the
rebels gone? Has the urge to rebel
vanished?
If I was alive in the sixties and I
knew Bob Dylan would reach the
significance he has, I would want
to destroy his credibility. Anyone
who inspires the sort of blind
devotion he did, must be put into
perspective. Although individuals
will emerge for whom the nineties
will be remembered, we are better
off without them. Societies can not
be pushed around by the
individuals, they evolve. If anyone
claims to speak for the masses they
are lying. We do not need icons; we
need cynicism.

Editorial
What has inspired me? What has
inspired the generation that I am a
member of? An acquaintance posed
these questions to me, and I am lost
for an answer.
The only icons I can point to are
personal ones. Mick Jagger and
Keith Richards mainly, and that just
reveals me as a relic of times past.
The Doors have held a fascination,
if only for needing explanation of
how Jim Morrison lasted so long.
What the questioner really
wanted to know was what did I, as
a representative of today's youth (or
yoof), think were the icons of our
age. He was worried that Nintendo,
Sega and computer use were
'fracturing society'; that machines
were destroying the motivation of
our culture, the individual was
being pampered to, the collective
ignored.
I never was any good at
representing today's youth,
however it is spelt, the only person
I have ever been any good at
showing off is myself. But still,
what do I believe will be the
memories of our current state?
What do I think the history books
will look back on and remember
about 1993? OK, I'll give it a go:
Grunge, Take That, Blind Date,
Gladiators, The Big Breakfast,
Maastricht and Bosnia. A l l those
were off the top of my head, but that
is just me, how do I know what
inspires a culture? How do I know
if history will judge Cilia Black to
be worthy of note?
Strangely enough, the questioner
could produce a list of icons for his
generation and I agreed with it.
Who could argue that Bob Dylan
and Timothy Leary did not affect
Cat's Eyes

As my literary associate Donny said
(see Music reviews); 'sweaty hog
bollocks'.

In a recently held meeting, Dave
Cohen (IC Radio boss/godfather
and Nicholas Cage look-a-like,
although Nick isn't going thin on
top quite as fast as Dave is), said
'...Felix is a place for literary
types...' (when compared to IC
Radio and STOIC). This fact is
undeniably true. But is he implying
that IC Radio and STOIC are places
for illiterate types? Could the T C
in both logos mean something else,
perhaps Illiterate Club?

Was the idea of a God created by
M a n ?
Thousands of years before
science, man had little answers to
many of life's riddles. To answer
the unknown, he could have created
a ' G o d ' , a supernatural
manifestation, a supreme being.
The psychological appeal of this
'God' was so great, it spread among
all races, often changing in form as
it did so.
All derivates have continued similar
traits through time: worship,
ceremonies, symbolism, obeying
laws; and most are still practiced
t o d a y .
But is there really something up
there worth praying to? Or does a
'God' only exist in the minds of
those who wish him to exist?

Message to the editor of St.Marys
magazine, Marmalade Sandwich,
and to the writer of an article in
which IC students were labelled as
train spotters. Message reads:
'bollocks'. Message ends.

IA's life was unexpectedly cut short
last Friday (30th April) in a
malicious crime that rocked the
letters page. It will be dearly missed
by all its followers.
The offender was 17 lines of Bold
Text that materialised from the
MCS Compugraphic typesetter.
The Bold Text was arrested the
following Wednesday and stands
trial in a few days time, accused of
depriving a columnist of material to
use. The M C S Typesetter was
charged with aiding and abetting but
was later released following a tear-
jerking emotional plea from all it's
nearest and dearest.
