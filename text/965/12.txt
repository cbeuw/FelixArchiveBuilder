There's gonna be a revolution
•
HansiCrockett joins Che Guevara, Mao Tse Tung and Vladimir Ilyich in trying to
overthrow the established order His Long March starts with a search for a publication
known as the Anarchists Cookbook.
I first heard of the Anarchist
Cookbook from two friends of mine
studying at Princeton (USA).
I'd been going on about
psychedelics, the right to internal
freedom and exploration of
expanded consciousness after
having read The Politics ofEcstasy
by Timothy Leary, figurehead of
psychedlic pioneering from the
Harvard academic world of the 60s.
Lenny said 'Man, you should
read this book there is in the USA:
it tells you how to make LSD with
banana skins—and it's banned!'.
With banana skins? No way, I
thought. Lenny hasn't got his hippy
facts quite right. Anyway, there
must be something in that book for
it to be banned. Censorship
paranoia is idiotic, not blind.
Then Mike further aroused my
interest by adding, in his usual
detached manner: M y roommate
has got it. It also tells you how to
make bombs.'
Hell. This is beginning to sound
interesting. I extracted some
approximate title from them,
gathering the book seemed available
only on mail-order.
'Can you get me photocopies?' I
asked.
'Yeah sure' replied Mike,
instantly forgetting.
I tried reminding the dudes
several times over my' last
postcards, then gave up.
Recently, while zapping channels
on some unlicensed T V some
resident on holidays had left in my
room, I fell upon one of these
daytime TV police stories (the 'true
story!' type), about this psycho
rapist it had taken ages to corner.
He kept coming up with alibis and
his calm was intimidating a few'
officers.

constant victim of brutal attacks'-Malcolm X

The fires of revolution burning yesterday
One clue they had found in his
house was (Hallelujah!) the
infamous black-covered Anarchist
Cookbook. Full screen shot. Wow!
This guy must be a psycho if he
reads this stuff! Unusual weapons
were found strewn about several
rooms. We must show the world
these people connect to an
underworld of mentally deranged
social outcasts who share literature
that's bad for your kids—here's a
sample on T V .
I now had a clue that mail-order
in the USA may not be the only way
of getting my hands on this book.
How about trying Waterstones in
High Street Ken?
A really pleasant young lady
informed me they were out of stock,
but I could try Oxford Street. The
next day I went. There are so many
bookstores up there, I decided to
look for more 'corrupting' Leary
books as well.
Well, the name 'Timothy Leary'
really earned me some strange
reactions. Silent shaking heads with
eyes staring at the floor were the
least polite, 'No' without further
comment the average and 'Sorry.
None at the moment. But you've
come to the right place'. The best,
with an extra nice knowing smile,
up some dark corner of the third
floor of Foyles in the
'Occultism/Mysticism' part, by the
T was on Venus' books. A n arts-
student-looking young lady again.
'Books Etc...' sent me to the
same type of section, next to
'Voodoo spells' or 'the end of the
world is at 4.37am on the first
Friday of the year of the rat as
revealed to me in my shower by the
astral body of my cat'. No Leary
books there. I was disappointed
when the chaotic dusty secondhand
bookstores didn't help either.
Finally, a self-righteous puritan-
looking 'miss' at Waterstones (what
a sadistic pleasure to askner!) sent
me up to the second or third floor
of one of their buildings, passing
'Gay and Lesbian Christian prayer
books' on the way up.
There the black Anarchist trophy
awaited me, this time a cool dude
behind it, joking about how it could
be sold in U S A now it had a
disclaimer of intention on the back.
I was to find Flashbacks, Tim
Leary's autobiography, back at the
High Street Ken branch.
Well, the Cookbook was well
worth its £17.99.
Chapters on Drugs, Weapons,
Electronic Devices and explosives!
How to synthesise D M T
('businessmen's L S D ' , so
nicknamed because of its powerful
effects that last the time of the
lunchbreak) in the kitchen, tripping
on legal substances such as nutmeg
(60p at Salisbury's) or Morning
Glory seeds (about £1 a pack of 60
in garden centres) or using cactus
buttons, mushrooms, strange vines,
smoking peanut skins or toad skins
etc...For equipped chemistry labs,
details on how to make L S D ,
psilocyn or psylocybin are included.
The Weapons part is especially
valid for USA, since firearms are
so readily available there—building
silencers or converting machine
guns to grenade launchers are some
examples given. A large variety of
hand weapons is also covered,
along with tips for street fighting.
Scramblers, jammers and various
detectors or spying devices are
covered in the electronics section.
The part on explosives is quite
complete, covering from grenades,
Molotov cocktail, nitroglycerin or
black powder synthesis to booby
traps, mines, road traps, door traps
etc.. .telling you how to make each
one.
For the more intellectual ones out
there, a preface gives a good intro
on anarchism today, its messages
and its goals.
The author claims the book is
intended for 'squares' who don't
understand anarchism or know IRA
techniques. That's probably why
they disapprove of other people
reading it!
