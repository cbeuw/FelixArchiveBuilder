Mary's from the inside
A new initiate into St Mary'sfindsthe truth behind the ancient medical schoo
saying: Dulce et decorum est, pro medicia schola experimentus mori
My first day at St Mary's passed in
a blur of fleeting impressions. A tall
dark fellow introduced himself to
-me with the words 'Good show old
boy, the name's Bija; what do the
chaps call you?'. He explained he
was a Sri Lankan, where English
teachers had been trained by the
previous generation of British
schools and so still taught 'King's
English'. He pointed out a chestnut-
haired lad known to everybody as
the 'Crazy Git'. Unfortunately,
Crazy Git wandered over next and
stuck out a hand, saying 'Morton's
the name, and womens my game.'
We hastily got rid of him, and asked
a passing Japanese student his
name. 'Ah, Tetuso, that's what they
call me. They call me that because
it my name.' he grinned. A tall,
thin, scruffy boy eating a malted
loaf came up and offered us some.
'Hello' he said. 'I'm Adrain. I won
the 'Nice Guy' Award of the Born-
Again Communists, and I just want
to tell you that some of my best
friends are brown. He was followed
by another thin lad wearing
spectacles who asked 'Do you have
7 A's at A-Leyel? My name's
Gordon.'
I was beginning to wonder if I
was the only graduate around and
started to ask if there were any
others. One girl glared at me and
grudgingly admitted 'yes' in a thick
American accent. Her name was
Marian.
We all soon found ourselves
facing our first human dissections.
I had expected the odd person to
faint or feel sick, but instead we all
started to hack and slash in a very
businesslike manner. With only one
'corpse' per eight students, only
two or three could mutilate away at
any one time, leaving the others to
wander around, ogling each other's
dead bodies and talk. I encountered
a vertically-challenged but
determined girl engrossed in greasy
human entrails. ' H i ' she said,
looking up, 'my name's
Elizabetamargueritasuzzannachris-
tiana, but you can call
Elizabetamarguerita. 'How about
'Elisa'?' I suggested delicately. 'Oh
alright, but let's face it, it's nowhere
near as sophisticated and classicially
Italian is it?' she said, disappointed.
She was fascinated to learn of Bija's
name. I joked 'it means man who
walk tall behind elephant in face of
big droppings.' 'Oh' replied the girl
seriously. 'That's amazing even
though it's not classically Italian.'
Our initialy Physiology practical
involved taking blood samples from
each other. Demonstrators showed
us how to locate veins, gendy insert
the needle of a syringe at an angle,
and never to push in the plunger if
the syringe contained air since the
patients tended to die soon
afterwards. I saw Morton
sadisticaly lie 'Oops, accident,
sorry,' while repeatedly ramming
needles deep into Gordon's arm
instead of blood sampling.
In our first lectures I was
surprised to find a very friendly
staff-Student Union relationship,
since I had got used to a more
distant form at Imperial where I
couldn't actually recall ever seeing
anybody from the SU. Afterwards,
Morton came up to me in a friendly
way, saying 'Hey, that'll make a
great shoplifting bag, was great for
stealing items off shelves. You
won't believe how much you can
walk away with,' he relished. I
hurriedly left and went to the
canteen—called 'Glady's' after the
fiery little old battleaxe who ran
it—and sat around talking with Bija
and Tetuso, who was always keen
to practice his English. 'I very
impressed with Morton' he
confessed. 'He use so much effort
in swearing. In Japan is more
efficient only say one bad word, but
he use lots and lots.' He shook his
head in awe.
Later that day I dropped into the
student hall 'Nutford House' to see
Bija. He was worried about his
neighbour opposite. 'The old boy's
plumb loco,' he whispered. We
looked past Bija's open door
towards his neighbour's who had
hung a poster of a man being flayed
alive by a tall demon outside his
room, only to realise that he had
slipped open his door slightly and
was watching us through the crack.
The next morning I met Marian
on the bus. 'I'm heavily into all this
Medicine stuff,' she asserted. 'The
fact I did a Physics degree instead
has nothing to do with it,' she added
hastily. 'Only a Republican would
even think such nasty thoughts like
that.'
Our Medical Statistics lecture
was in the mysterious Cockburn
Theatre, and I tried asking a couple
of nurses for directions. Except
Morton came up, flung an arm
around their necks and whispered
'Hi babes. Let's go make babies.'
They gave him nasty looks and left,
leaving him bewildered. Luckily,
Gordon was nearby. 'It's up in the
hospital. I don't wish to brag but I
did rather well at school' he said.
'F*** me!' said Morton as we
entered. 'AH these white walls!
Someone get me a spraycan!'
To my dismay, my pen dried up
halfway through the lecture. I leant
over and asked Morton if he had a
spare pen I could borrow. He
flipped one over. At the end of the
lecture Morton turned and
demanded £1 for borrowing his
pen. 'You can have it back, I only
needed it for the lecture,' I said,
scandalised. But he insisted, and I
found myself forking out the cash,
while he smirked. 'Golly, that
person sure use long words,' said
Tetsuo. 'What that last word mean?
The long one—yep?' He suddenly
frowned, looked through his bag
and realised he had forgotten to
bring in his practical file. He
moaned 'Oh shit, I'm dead!' looked
furtively around to check nobody
was watching, then started banging
his head against the desk. I
hurriedly tried to stop him as he was
damaging the surface of the bench.
A little later I met Stephen, a
friend from Imperial who had
dropped over from his 4-year
'Applied Biology' degree. We sat
in the library balcony, talking. A
boy named Syd Masam came up
grinning, said 'Call me Mazza' and
walked away, guffawing. We stared.
after him for a moment, then I went
on to expalin to Stephen how the >
work was a lot more interesting than
Physical Biochemistry, but the
actual workload was very heavy.
Later that evening I dropped into
the medical students' hall 'Wilson
House', curious what Morton might
get up to at night. I walked along
the 'Corridor of Faith' where all the
rising young Christian Union stars
like Marcus Peron, Alician and
others lived among lesser mortals,
walking around the odd jar of
burning incense and the
'ATHEISTS P L E A S E T U R N
RIGHT' signs pointing towards the
toilets. I found Morton in the T V
room watching 'Casualty' for
laughs, with a 'Heh heh heh' as
each accident happened and the
occasional 'Yes, yes, go on, stick
your hand all the way in, you fool'.
He started to tell me about how one
