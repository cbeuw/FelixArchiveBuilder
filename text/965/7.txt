Rag
FETE ' 9 3
On Wednesday Queen's Lawn will
be transformed as never before.
Attracting over twenty charities
from all walks of life ICU R A G is
proud to present its annual R A G
FETE. Starting at 12 noon, you can
bounce like a baby on Turning
Point's Bouncy castle or through
yourself at a wall on their Bar fly;
you can zoom round the grounds on
a 21 seater bike, drink yourself silly
on free beer lucky dips and gin
palaces, be an ace sniper on our
laser controlled firing range the
events are endless. Extra free
entertainment will be provided by
IC Radio and live bands from Jazz
and Rock Soc. Ice cream and candy
floss will be available for your
nourishment (well, we can't have
you drinking FREE BEER on an
empty stomach can we?). See the
table below, or elsewhere on this
page for a slightly more
comprehensive indication of what's
on.
GET STUFFED
You've just spent Wednesday
afternoon (and most of your pitiful
grant cheque!) on shooting a little
target with a coloured light,
jumping up and down on a rubber
castle (makes a change!), or taking
all your pent-up aggression out on
somebody's old china. So now
what? You need the perfect end to
an almost perfect day - that little
something to round it all off nicely
- yes, you need R A G DINNER!
For the minimal fee of about Â£15,
you can stuff yourself silly, whilst
'enjoying' the company of about
forty other Raggies. I say forty, but
numbers are increasing so rapidly,
I'm sure that by the time I've
finished typing this, we'll be
nearing triple figures (!!!).
Hmm, well, anyhow - if you
fancy the prospect of getting all
dressed up and having somewhere
to go, don't come to the Rag Dinner
- it traditionally ends in a
foodfight...and as there is no
gungewrestling at the Rag Fete this
year, there'll be a lot of people
desperate to get mucky. You have
been warned! Rag Dinner will be
held in the U D H , at around 8pm,
after Rag Fete. To get your ticket,
see Lorna in the Rag Office, or at
today's meeting; but bring your
chequebook, we need the money
before Wednesday.
CORRECTION
Sorry! M y mistake! When
desperately trying to recall
'platypus' last week, to fill up a
spare patch on my very own Rag
page (a whole page, just for
me...that's more than Cats Eyes!
Maybe the job of IAO is more
important than I thought?), I didn't
actually get it right.
The story should have run 'The
fat cow was in the swimming
hyphen pool, looking through the
window at H I M . H E smelt like
Jacuzzi, and a duck hyphen billed
hyphen platypus. Horse nut bolt, so
he had to go, in the nude, without
any flumes.' Satisfied? And if it's
still not right, then I'm afraid you
can forget it, cos I'm not spending
another week trying to explain to
the uninitiated what the hell it's all
about.
'P.s. You still haven't all sent your
money in yet! Repent now, or we
shall start getting violent.
