STOIC win award
The Student Television of Imperial
College (STOIC) has again won
acclaim at the National Student
Television Association conference.
The 1993 convention was held over
Easter at Bloomsbury Television,
University College London. STOIC
came second in the 'Music to
Video' category, for their
Valentine's Day video, and also in
the 'Live' category, for their
coverage of the Jarniroquai concert.
Imperial's channel came third in the
'Special Brief category, for a film
based around light, and in the
'Documentary' category, for their
SplotSoc promotional video. The
conference itself was host to guest
lecturers from television, such as
Fiona Armstrong, G M T V ' s
honorary Scottish resident, and
Sebastian Scott, editor of rival and
much more original programme,
'The Big Breakfast'.
Ash cash ahead
by J o n t y B e a v a n
A special deal negotiated by the
Rector, Sir Eric Ash, means
Imperial students can buy bike
helmets at a knock down price.
Any student with an Imperial
College Union card can now buy a
bike helmet for £16.95, a reduction
of £8 from the normal sale price of
£24.95. Helmets can be bought
from E Chamberlain and Sons at
71-77 Kentish Town Road. A
journey to E Chamberlain's
emporium is described as a ten
minute bike ride from the north of
Hyde Park.
Sir Eric, a keen cyclist, has taken
a particular interest in bike safety.
His worry that students would not
be able to afford the expensive
headgear prompted the Rector to
personally intervene in the situation.
At present the discounted protective
equipment can only be brought
from E Chamberlain's shop. The
helmets may be sold from Imperial
College Union Reception before the
end of the academic year.
edic training eased
by D e c l a n Curry
More intensive training could
reduce the training period for junior
doctors from 12 to 7 years,
according to a new report. The
inquiry team led by Dr Kenneth
Caiman, the chief Medical Officer,
also called for a rapid increase in
the number of consultants, and
better communications between
educational bodies, postgraduate
deans, and NHS management.
The Caiman report has now been
presented to Virginia Bottomley,
the Health Secretary. The report is
also being sent to professional,
educational and health service
groups for consultation, with
comments requested by 1 July.
The Caiman team was set up in
July 1992 to- examine current
arrangements for specialist medical
training, and to see if changes were
needed to bring the U K into line
with European medical directives
on minimum training standards and
mutual recognition of
qualifications. The team examined
three main areas: the content of
specialist training programmes; the
system for appointment to
consultant posts; and the relations
between U K and European
Community (EC) medical
legislation.
The report said that specialist
training in the U K was
'substantially longer' than in
Europe, and could be reduced
without threatening standards. The
report called for specialist training
with 'defined starting and finishing
points and structured curricula,'
emphasising that the lack of a
definite 'end-point' extends the
length of training. The document
also called for flexibility, choice,
competition and assessment on
merit to be in-built in training
programmes.
On training grades, the report
recommended 'that the career
registrar and senior registrar grades
be combined.' It also called for
consideration of a single training
grade 'incorporating the Senior
House Office Grade'. The report
also recommended that a Certificate
of Completion of Specialist
Training (CCST) should be
awarded by the General Medical
Council when 'a doctor has
completed a training programme to
a standard compatible with
independent practice.'
The Caiman team say that the
main body of the report could be
implemented within 2 or 3 years 'of
being accepted by ministers', said
the team, though 'the expansion of
consultant numbers may take 5
years'.
ABRC for axe in Waldegrave White Paper fury
by D e c l a n Curry
There is concern this morning for
the future of one of Britain's top
scientific bodies. The Government
has studiously refused to deny
persistent press reports that it is to
axe the Advisory Board for the
Research Councils (ABRC).
The ABRC is an expert group of
scientists which independently
advises the Government on
scientific policy. The Board has a
reputation for vigorous
independence, founded on a history
of stormy confrontation with a long
line of Education and Science
ministers. Recently, Education
Secretaries, including John
McGregor and Kenneth Clarke
have refused to publish
recommendations from the
committee.
The anxiety for the future of the
ABRC comes as the Government is
putting the finishing touches to its
Science White Paper, due in early
June. The contents of the White
Paper will be influenced by the
results of the year-long consultation
initiated by M r Waldegrave after he
was appointed Science Minister in
1992. Over 700 submissions were
received by the Government during
the consultation period. The ABRC
was one of many bodies to submit
proposals to the Science
consultation.
This consultation paper from the
ABRC is now the nub of the
disagreement between the
Government and its scientific
critics. Tom Wilkie, the
Independent's Science Editor,
claimed this week that M r
Waldegrave would use the
publication of the White Paper to
abolish the ABRC in its current
form, and to replace them with a
Civil Service committee firmly
based within the Science Ministry.
Mr Wilkie further predicted that the
ABRC would be wound up in
September after Sir David Phillips,
the current A B R C chairman,
retires. Since the publication of the
Independent article, Felix has been
informed that Sir David's contract
was renewed for a final six-month
term 'within the last few weeks'.
Government information officers
contacted by Felix all refused to
deny that a plan exists to abolish the
current ABRC. Tim Hunt, a senior
press officer at the Office of Public
Service and Science, said that M r
Waldegrave 'has made it quite clear
that he intends to maintain an
independent advisory system, with
experts from academia and
industry'. Another spokesman, who
did not disclose her name, said that
Mr Waldegrave wanted the 'best
possible independent advice.'
Mr Hunt told Felix that the
Independent article was 'not stricdy
true', and that M r Wilkie was 'not
strictly accurate'. Mr Hunt added
that the idea for the reform of the
ABRC sprang directly from the
Board's own submission to the
science policy consultation. M r
Hunt later clarified his comments,
and said it was 'not strictly true' to
suggest that the ABRC had asked
to be dissolved. This suggestion had
been made to Felix by Andrew
Puddephatt, General Secretary of
Liberty, formerly the National
Council of Civil Liberties, who
added that he had been 'misled by
the Independent.' Earlier, in the
Independent article, M r Puddephatt
was quoted describing the
'abolition' of the A B R C as
'hypocrisy'.
Mr Hunt claimed the ABRC
submission 'indicated broadly a
case for another body with more
powers and with a more wide
ranging brief than their own.' M r
Hunt added that the ABRC called
for Mr Waldegrave to consider
forming 'another independent
body'.
Mr Hunt's comments have been
slammed by Dr Jeremy Bray, M P
for Motherwell South and former
Labour Science and Technology
spokesman. Dr Bray told Felix that
Mr Hunt was 'misinterpreting what
the ABRC said.' A spokesman for
Dr Lewis Mooney, Labour's
current Science spokesman, said
that the ABRC submission called
for 'a board for the research
councils', and did not call for the
abolition of the current research
councils board, the ABRC. Dr John
Mulvey, of the Bath-based pressure
group Save British Science, said
they would soon issue an
'alternative' White Paper, which
would propose changes to the
ABRC. 'We would separate the
implementation and shaping of
policy,' he said.
