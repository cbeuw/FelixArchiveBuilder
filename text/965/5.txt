And now for the good news...
It's babies galore onfloorfive! Declan Curry clucks over the new arrivals
in the Sherfield Building
G o o d N e w s correspondent
The patter of tiny feet has been
heard on the top floor of the
Sherfield Building this week. Felix
is delighted to note that the elegant
and graceful stork, 34, has gently
delivered no less than five bundles
of joy to our top administrators.
Sir Eric and Lady Claire Ash
have thrice again become proud
grandparents, news made sweeter
by the delivery of their first
grandson. Little Joseph, born only
this Tuesday, weighed in at a
cheeky 91b 2oz. His new cousin,
Alexandra, achieved a healthy 71b
9oz, while the eldest of this
cherubic trinity, Matilda, was a
plump 71b lloz. Alexandra is the
daughter of Moscow-based
journalists, but Mother is taking
some time out in London to share
her happy child with her adoring
grandparents. 'We're delighted,'
Lady Ash said.
Meanwhile, there is news of new
progress in the Development
Office. Jeannie and Andy
McGregor are the proud and happy
parents of bouncing Tessa Frances,
who entered the world on 4 April
at 81b 13oz. Mother and baby are
said to be 'absolutely fine', and a
close family friend told Felix that
Tessa was 'a very sleepy baby'.
The champagne corks have been
popping at the news of a 'First
Edition' for Imperial's Press
Officer, Karen Peploe. Karen and
partner Ian Parkes are, reportedly,
full of the bloom of parenthood of
Bruce William, born early last
Thursday morning. Bruce, at 81b
2oz, shares a birthday with Karen's
friend and colleague Liz Carr, also
of the Press Office. Karen and
Bruce are both 'doing fine', gushed
sources close to the happy mother,
completely off the record and on an
unattributable basis.
