Gangster A p p a r e l
Nice acting, shame about the play.
Based around two members of the
Mafia, GangsterApparel focuses on
the changing relationship between
Lovie Falco and Joey Pugg.
Although it seems to the audience
to happen in the 50s and 60s on
many occasions the scene is
apparentiy set in 1992.
The day follows through from
planning a 'hit' on an important
businessman to its aftermath and the
repercussions that will follow them
the rest of their lives. For Lovie the
only important factor is whether he
looks good. Killing people is part
of his job, but his major

English National Opera unveiled
their 93/94 season last week. There
are new faces in two key
positions—Dennis Marks takes over
from Peter Jonas as General
Director, Sian Edwards replaces
Music Director Mark Elder—but as
yet they bring with them no radical
changes in programming or casting.
Dennis Marks reaffirmed the
company's commitment to dramatic
and financial accessibility; all
operas will continue to be
performed in English, and prices
will be held at current levels. This
means that on the day, a balcony
seat costs about the same as a West
End cinema screening, not bad for
live entertainment on a scale larger
than anywhere else in London.
As might be expected from a
company with a substantial box-
office deficit from the last season,
there is nothing of a potentially
theatre-emptying adventurousness,
bar the world premiere of Blond
Eckbert, an ENO commission from
Judith Weir. However, there is
plenty of interest; a new Lohengrin
marks the return of Wagner to the
ENO repertoire after an absence of
eight years, and Jonathan Miller has
been lured back to the Coliseum to
produce Rosenkavalier. This new
production features John
Tomlinson, superb as Hagen in the
recent Covent Garden Ring, in the
part of Baron Ochs, and is designed
by Stefanos Lazaridis, who was
responsible for among other things
the memorable filing cabinet
cityscape of Dr Faust.
The wonderful Jenufa is to have
what is surprisingly its first ever
production at the Coliseum in the
Felix 965
consideration is that he should look
like 'someone' in a crisp suit rather
than the 'nobody' that he in fact is.
He also instills in his partner Joey
the necessity for good clothes.
Both actors were excellent in
their portrayal of the two-bit hoods.
They made you believe that their
characters were real, and added a
lot to a mediocre script.
This was the play's world
premiere. It started originally as a
one-act play and in my opinion it
should have stayed that way, as the
few good laughs that are scattered
around may have been concentrated
in one area. Marks out of ten? 4.

first instalment of a projected
Janacek cycle. A Puccini series is
also planned, starting with a new
production of La boheme featuring
rising American star Roberta
Alexander as Mimi.
Looking further ahead, Sian
Edwards, who studied at the
Leningrad Conservatoire, has said
she wants to do more Russian
repertoire, in particular Boris
Godunov and the awesome
Khovanshchina. and most enticing
of all, the new production of Lulu
rumoured to be on the cards a
couple of years ago, is promised
'within the next two or three
seasons'.
