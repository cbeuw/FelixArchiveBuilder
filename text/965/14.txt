Stones from heaven

They fall like stones from the sky.
Well maybe not stones. Stones have
such an unexciting sound to them.
They possess more shape than
stones, you can see them as they
fall. Twisting 360 degrees right,
gracefully done. There is, though,
something very basic about it that
makes me think of stones. How low
they come. Almost as if they don't
intend to open their chutes at all.
Can you reach out and touch them?
Their parachutes open. They are
decelerated and are drawn upright.
Now instead of falling they glide,
still gracefully.
Through a pair of binoculars I can
see closer their form. Actual
humans. Arms and legs. That one
was unstable as he opened, twisting
and turning. It always instils me
with such an urge. The need for
excitement. The desire to do
something to destory the London
pollution that creeps within us all.
On the Sunday as we were
returning from Scotland in the
minibus, someone asked me why I
had continued to parachute after my
first jump. He was sitting opposite
me. He annoyed me somewhat.
One of those people who can't stop
talking, and he was very arrogant
with it too. He also asked me, after
about an hour of our nine hour
journey, if I ever smiled. No, I
replied, grinning.
It had been a very full weekend.
Arriving late Friday evening.
Setting up tents in the rain and the
dark with only one torch between
the ten of us. One of those pen
torches. You know the type. Free
form Nat West it was. It reminded
me of my first, and only, digital
watch. It had a light that was so
weak that it would only show the
minutes. Not the hours.
Well, I received no sleep that
night, nor the preceding Saturday
night. I was so cold. The Scottish
weather system. It's not a mystery
Singles
Next Thursday FilmSoc proudly
presents 'Singles', our first film in
our new home which is the Union
Concert Hall. Bridget Fonda, Matt
Dillon, and Campbell Scott all
appear in this good-natured and
humourous study of six friends in
the chick centre of Seattle. All the
main stars give winning
performances as hopeful
twentysomethings exploring the
to me. How can anything that is so
predictable be a mystery to
anybody? Scotland is great like that.
Some places you go to the weather
can either make or break your stay.
Somewhere like Spain. Not
Scotland though. In Scotland it
makes your stay. I haven't stopped
talking about it.
I think the only reason that I
didn't freeze at night was the fact
that my circulation was kept going
by my jaw, telling anything that
would listen that I hated myself for
making myself do something I
didn't really want to do. Like sleep
in a tent with all my clothes on,
unable to curl up into a ball because
the damn tent is so small, and will
the bloody thing stay up anyway?
It fluttered around an awful lot. I'm
sure it shouldn't do that.
That was the answer I gave to that
guy on the bus. About the first jump
and all. I was already annoyed at
him for noticing that I hadn't smiled
in an hour. Do you not go an hour
without smiling? I wondered. No,
you don't, do you? I saw his
arrogant grinning face.
I get pensive on long journeys. I
like to watch the country roll past.
In the dark? Admittedly, yet it was
dark! But in the dark it is so much
more exciting. You stare, and you
stare. Nothing at first. But you also
listen to the sound of travel. And
then all of a sudden you see what
you want to see from the bus.
Straight from your mind.
Thoughts that are you. Memories.
That's nice I think. Like the lyrics
to a song which you can't
understand. You begin to hear them
say what you want them to say.
Something you can relate to.
Something that has happened to
you. Then, hey they're singing
about me! I really know this song.
If you find out what they're really
saying, it's disappointing. It's
another love song. It happened to
singles scene, searching for love
and all that comes with it. Comic
moments abound in this interesting
movie, divided into witty chapters,
each with a title such as 'Have fun,
stay single', by director Cameron
Crowe, himself described as a
combination of Woody Allen and
John Hughes. Everyone that has
seen this film mentions the excellent
Seattle Grunge soundtrack, which
someone else.
He sat in there grinning, anyway.
Oblivous to the sound of travel.
Why did you do more than one
jump? He repeated. He'd asked
everyone else already. I get a kick
from making myself do something
that I don't really want to do. I
replied. It was the first thing that
had entered my head, although I had
all too often asked myself the same
question.
Waiting to get into the plane
earlier that day at Strathallan
airfield is a good example. I was
bloody scared, I suppose, is a good
way of summing up how I felt.
Perhaps it was to do with fact that
I was about to jump out of a plane
with a parachute that I had packed
for myself not half an hour ago.
How safe I shall feel, I thought.
When I sit on the edge of the plane,
legs blown sideways by the cool air.
Then when I did sit hanging out of
the plane, it really struck me.
You're going to jump out of a plane
with a parachute you packed
on its own makes the film worth
seeing! 'Singles' was not marketed
at the movies in a massive way that
most films are, but it proved very
popular, so if you missed it in
January, now is your chance to put
the record straight. Watch out for
a cameo appearance by Tim Burton,
and we'll see you there!
Don't forget, we have moved
home from Mech Eng 220 to the
better Union Concert Hall, courtesy
of a strangely helpful sabbatical and
our acquisition of an excellent new
yourself? Jesus! I could see the
epitaph right then. Chisselled into
crumbling green rock years in the
future. A child reads it, as you do.
Here lies Rob Jones. You know, he
couldn't even pack his lunch box
without crushing the Blue Riband?
But it was a familiar feeling. And
dealing with it really gives me a
buzz. The adrenalin courses
through your veins. You become
very single-minded.
You see that big yellow cross out
there? I pointed at the target 2000ft
below us and half a mile away.
Contained perfecdy by the beautiful
Scottish highlands. Yeah. The jump
master yelled above the noise of the
single engine. That's where you'll
see me land. That's where I'll be
when I hit the ground!
I missed of course. But that is
how you become after your first
jump. It's not like any other sport
I know. You are left in awe by the
fear you have felt and what you
have achieved.
