S c h o o l of Fish
— Half a Believer
School of Fish; a brave, but
slippery double pun, referring to
either: wide-eyed, open-mouthed
schoolkids epitomising the neo-
Blank Generation, as a result of the
proliferation of Nintendos; a group
of our scaled friends studying in the
name of Shakespeare and
Pythagoras; or more simply, a shoal
of fish. The other possibility isn't
worth contemplating as it's the most
ridiculous. Either way, SOF may be
a bunch of ignorant imbeciles in
which case they've wasted my time
(and yours).
On the title track, the singer has
a Mick Jagger drawl, dog-gone
dirty and very rock 'n' roll. 'Half
a Beleiver' presumably highlights
the naked truth behind normally
apathetic wannabees, and inhabits
that vulnerable area between corp

Dear Music Editor
If you have a drastic, dire need
for a space filler on your pages then
print this review. However, if you
can put your hands on a 1950
excerpt from Angling Times, a
photo of Donny Osmond on Top of
The Pops, a doodle done by a first
year physicist in a lecture, a till
receipt from Sainsbury's, a leaflet
by the Islamic Society, or indeed
any other such item of equal moral,
mental or social significance, then
please do not hesitate to print that
instead. For I can say in all honesty,
hand on heart, and trying
desperately not to use expletives,
that this 4 track C D . , is truly
worthless.

T V E y e - K i l l e r Fly
From the fragments of Eat came T V
Eye, a band firmly hanging out in
the bleak hinterland of grimy
swirling nihilism. The sort of place
where everyone wears black. The
guitars are hypnotic, a gentle buzz
into your soul, or whatever we've
put there now.
'Killer Fly' would sit comfortably
in Blade Runner; the security
camera pans voyeuristically,
bromine dripping from the lens.
Have you seen the future Trash
People?

and alternative rock. The rest
swings to the former and is just
mundane—not because it is
particularly corp, just unmoving.
Dare I say 'grunge'.
'Free up those little fenced
boundaries', is the pleading claim
on the white label about our
inherent reservations, but this is
asking too much considering it is
Kingmaker: 1 0 Years
A s l e e p E.P.
Back in the halcyon, salad days of
1991, Kingmaker were more solid
than an 8- kebab-induced colonic
blockage. Indeed, I remember a gig
at the Richmond where the ceiling
fell in on the bar below, and the PA
speakers had to be physically held
up - such was the whirligig induced
by then youthful and shy Mr Hardy
(what?- sic. Ed).
Unfortunately, since their
audience was unceremoniously
hijacked by Suede, Kingmaker have
achieved naught but the crawl up
their own arses in an attempt at re-
invention. ' 10 Years Asleep' is not
the atrocity certain pundits say it is,
A o n — Q u i e t J o y s
Imagine a group who attempt to
combine the ambience of Clannad
with the 'contemplative-meditation-
to-a-beat' of Enigma, with a liberal
sprinkling of pop sensibilities, then
imagine putting this on your player
and very quickly becoming bored
out of your skull. Enough said.

No..No..It's hideous! You can't make me say that

Jingle jangle, guitar based indie

ditch. This Picture are splashing
around, making steady process to
be sure, but they end up sounding
like The 4 Of Us. That may be a
compliment, but only if you like
The 4 Of Us. Easy, huh.

not justified musically. Despite
being overseen by a bloke who has
previously produced the
Replacements and Faith No More.
Sitting on the fence, I only half
believe SOF, and frankly I don't
care either way. So to your petty
request, fuck you, I won't do what
you tell me.

and as with the last single it is saved
by its flip side. 'I'm in Love' is a
corker, but not a patch on 'Little
Miss Kingmaker' or 'Wonderful
Garden'.
What is sad, is that if the album
bombs, Chrysalis will drop them
like shit off the proverbial shovel
(oh, fuckin' tragic - sic. Ed) and I'll
probably be buying my drip-dry
nylon camisoles from Loz Hardy in
BHS...... Ah! Such is exile.

• Out now on Chrysalis. No
surprise there. They are
undoubtably appearing somewhere
in concert soon, too, as bands tend
to do that sort of thing. Don't know
where, though. Just you keep your
eyes open...
Hi I'm Rufus, and I'm a bit of blank space using the
opportunity to express myself. What I want to know
Lovecraft: M e d i c i n e E.P.
And now, sweethearts, a serious
message to those who will come
after we're all gone; take heed my
words and apply caution, for should
you ever encounter the word
'anthemic' in pop circulars, be
assured that this adjective refers to
(and I cite God's own laws here) 'a
portentous slab of blustery clump
rock with a rubble-rouser chorus'.
It's used here. Lovecraft don't use
guitars; they've got
Messerschmitts, and basslines that
come from Junkers burning out of
the sky.
Well, that's a fib if ever I wrote
one, and suggests that there may
well be more porkies on the way,
tinged with a soupcon of merriment
Blind M e l o n
- A Slice Of M e l o n
It seems that to be a muso
journalist, you have to totally slam
a band with your cynical wit or
praise them with serious overuse of
adjectives, but Blind Melon are
neither brilliant nor bland enough
to inspire either sentiment. With
their funky baseline and widely
influenced style, they are however
quite original and there are definite
signs of musicianship. The songs
have promising tunes, but don't
seem to fulfil their potential,
although the 'B sides' of the CD are
more impressionable. Blind Melon
lack that certain something that
makes you want to convert your
friends to the cause, but watch out
for them in the future.
To summarise:
Blind Melon are not dead crap
But they minorly smell of poo and
wee
Maybe that's a bit harsh
They are 'smart' musicians
But they lack that certain
something to make them 'insatiable'

Scene One: Picture a band, three
fresh-faced lads from Nottingham,
playing energetic bouncy pop.
Scene Two: Imagine a single
called 'Carnival Round Face', a
black round disc no less.
Scene Three: Listen to the
aforementioned single and
remember that to be young is to
have fun.
Scene Four: Read review which
says you might enjoy this band live
(but probably not dead).

..Are there any female bits of blank space out there,
into macrame and Richard Stilgoe. Fun evenings,
discretion assured etc...
to make you think I have charm,
etc... This is not sub-Bikini Kill rot-
gril fare, 'Jilly Cooper's Riders' is
not a load of sweaty hog bollocks,
the 'recovery' is entirely due to
Norman Lamont's fiscal policy, and
T & L , GDFC did not write the
shiniest review in the history of the

really, they're available on Lemon

but this is very past tense now, as
we didn't get the info until the tour
had finished. Clever bastards. Not
that we wanted to go anyway.
