Fine young Carnival
Good venue with excellent acoustics and cheap bar prices seeks decent
sized, appreciative audience to enjoy themselves in. Likes Selecter,
Heartthrobs, Ariel, God's Zoo. One night only. Must have life.

unreliable haircuts. To our dismay,

Hello. It's another anonymously
positive morning in that region
known to it's occupants as the
'world' (yes, it is a bit idiosyncratic,
isn't it?), but for now, I'm a bit out
of sorts. A sugary, sepia-tinged,
and slightly bitten Granny Smiths
sits on the desk in front, the cassette
deck is feeding me Curve and PJH
(curious, that - sic. Ed), and I'm
struggling for the wit and
succinctness that is the envy of,
well, I know who it's the envy of
even if you don't. Ha! Smug
bastard, aren't I.
So my gambit fails, I stare out my
own navel once more (I seem to be
physically incapable of 'looking up
my own arsehole' which, I believe,
is a favoured expression in these
esteemed pages), and decide to go
for broke with this handsome-sized
carnival review, though 'tis but a
stripling as I write. Anyway, if you
didn't see Friday night, it went
something like this...
My good friend leaves his trusty
camera in my less than trusty hands,
babeosity
only minutes away. The chap whose
photos accompany this piece shows
up before any of the bands begin,
and I'm glad to be relieved of this
i extra artistic duty. He takes his
The Heartthrobs: Unconventional use of microphones
Quad. I dunno; 'Big gig. Selecter.
Heartthrobs. Couple of others.
Only a fiver'. We gain the bar
without difficulty, grateful for a few
drinks before the inevitable packed
to bursting scenario that's surely
camera back, and we three heroic
types head towards the Ents Lounge
for God's Zoo.
God's Zoo are fun, in a 'warm-
up cabaret' sense. The singer, a
silver-trousered ragamuffin, throws
out his arms, dances beyond the
confines of the stage, spars with the
audience, looking for all the world
like James Brown thirty years ago
playing a set with the Chilli
Peppers. Lenny Kravitz rears his
ugly head once or twice, but the few
exasperated comments the singer
fires at the audience who are, quite
obviously, too scared to move in
case they fall over, punctuate their
performance with charm. A good
set, and a good start.
The crowd is beginning to grow
at this point, but not as fast as one
expected. It is also around this time
that ugly rumours of people being
deterred by 'shock' prices reach our
ears. More beer, and yet more
renditions of Brotherhood of Man
songs as played by the Fall. 'Long
ago-ah... outside a village in
Mexico-ah... Lived a young
shepherd boy, Angelo-ah...'
Ariel's presence is announced,
and the worthy audience make the
necessary trek to the more
atmospheric concert hall, no doubt
persuaded on the way to part with
slight monies for viciously coloured
liquids purporting to be cocktails;
I hear the barman responsible can
be quite a persuasive fellow.
Ariel's initial appearance is
slightly disappointing; A dancing
Mike Edwardes clone doing
anything but playing his guitar over
half an acre of Sisters backbeat circa
'85, but they get going. Admittedly,
when they get going they have a
tendency to wander up the blind
alley marked 'wannabe Jesus
JonesT, but they're a bright and
poppy proposition, and they go
down well with the crowd. They
play their ace a little too early, in
the form of a bubbly girl who
could've failed an audition for
Dollar, acting out a coy but charged
relationship with the
guitarist/frontman that works well
in the context of the formal
structure known as 'guitar-driven
dance'. From thereon in, it's
downstairs to watch the
Heartthrobs.
I haven't seen the Heartthrobs for
two years, and, if I recall, they were
bloody good that night. So it came
