Are the Nerds next door?
Can you picture a typical Imperial student? Jonty Beavan asks the opinions
of Imperial students about this peculiar character
The digital alarm goes off, slowly
a rake-like figure rises from the
narrow, duvet-covered bed.
Climbing up he moves over to the
sink and switches on the light above
it. He winces, waiting for the glare
to fade, he places his glasses on his
malformed nose. The acne had
flared up again overnight, but
heroically, he scrapes the Bic razor
across his chin, making manly scars
out of pimples. When he has
finished he clambers into the faded
blue jeans and pulls on a heavy
metal T-shirt. Opening the curtains
he looks out across a waking
campus; the day of a typical IC
student has begun.
Is this really the case? Is every
one at Imperial a poor excuse for
a human being? The Students of St
Mary's Hospital Medical School
seem to think so: In the recent issue
of their magazine 'Marmalade
Sandwich' IC students were
described as: trainspotters, unable
to chat up girls and only interested
in playing the recorder.
But what do we think of
ourselves? Is this the image
Imperial sees when it looks into its
own navel? Armed with a badly
functioning taperecorder and a list
of questions, I roamed the JCR in
search of the souls of our scientists.
Admittedly I never expected anyone
to confess to intimate knowledge of
the 7.15 from London to Brighton,
so I planned ahead. After asking
how IC was perceived by those in
its walls, I tossed in a couple of
question to give you all a chance to
show your worldly knowledge.
Smugly superior? Me? Not a
chance. A warning in advance: Due
to the poor recording equipment and
my lack of technical knowledge,
spellings of names from now on
become creative. I do apologise for
any offence caused, none is
intended.
After talking to several people, I
discovered that I hadn't switched on
my tape recorder. Studying science
at IC doesn't count for that much.
A few technical hiccups later Demi
became my first 'on the record'
victim. As a physics student she saw
the general mass around her as
hard-working and unconcerned by
fashion. Her reason for coming to
Imperial was the academic record
and the credibility of the degree
here. The last book she had read
was Swing Hammer Swing, the
latest Booker prize winner. A
ludicrous number of people I spoke
to had seen the Jungle , Book
recently, but Demi was the first one
to admit to it. If she could have
anything of her heart's desire? A
tent or a holiday was the best offer
she could muster.
Next Sutatrsam had a vivid
picture of our average student:
Jeans, Jacket, Specs and very
studious because he is studying for
exams all the time. Sutatrsam's
most recent read was a text book
and he joined the crowd who had
spent time watching the Jungle
Book over Easter. If the world
could offer him any richness, what
would it be? Peace and quiet is his
only need.
One feeling that emerged was that
while other colleges looked up to us
academically, we were social
pariahs. Quite a few spods about,
said Tom Halliwell; there are too
many science students here.
Richard Steeps saw the IC student
as wearing a Parka coat, greasy
black hair with ever present glasses.
'Spoddy wankers' was Bruce
Patterson's description, he lives
with friends from University
College London and Kings College.
'Everybody hates us' he continued,
but did he regret corning here? 'Yes
I do actually', he muttered
morosely.
It became clear that the decision
to come to Imperial was a big issue
among students, now they were
here. The academic standing was
the largest carrot hanging in front
of prospective undergraduates.
Another reason was to be in
London; the bright lights had held
an attraction for many. It had
frequently been the deciding factor
in the 'reputation' versus 'cost of
living' debate that most A level
students go through when applying
to London University. Although, I
only found one Oxbridge reject in
the JCR, many, many more exist.
I doubt if Imperial keeps records of
those who choose the dreaming
spires and were handed down to
London, but I believe they would
make interesting reading.
Strangely, many questioned the
choice of studying at Imperial but
few regretted it. While everyone
admitted that the work- obsessed
image of IC students was justified,
not many wanted to leave. Noting
the more positive sides of the IC
stereotype, Jamie (name and
department unknown) said students
here worked very hard and were
more highly motivated than at other
Nerds R Us militia
colleges.
Those who did regret their choice
appeared to be very bitter. Nadira
Ali, who had just finished her
exams, complained about the level
of work. 'Sometimes they go over
the top' she said, regretting that it
was easy for some: very clever
people don't need to work they just
have it in them, but not me, she
added. Luke from Management
moaned about 'freaky geeky
students', the reason he was
studying here was as a victim of
'geekyness'. He wanting to be
taught at the best place,
academically, and now lamented it.
'My personality doesn't gel', was
his attitude to how he fits in at
Imperial.
The only one to quarrel with the
academic reputation of IC was
Caroline Mekesta. After negotiating
an appearance fee for her comments
on Imperial, she criticised the lack
of attention given to
undergraduates. 'If you ask them
(Lecturers) a question, they just
don't want to know'. Because
college is too heavily geared
towards postgraduates, the
academic reputation wasn't
justified, she concluded. She also
had a clear vision of the typical IC
student: White, drinks lots of beer,
is in the Rugby team, has
overgrown hair, but not as an
image, wears a heavy metal T shirt
and doesn't know how to relate to
women. Any one out there
interested in a hate/hate
relationship?
What of the dreams of those in
the JCR? Being rich appeared a
popular desire, but strangely
happiness was also a frequent reply.
Could it be that the age of peace and
love is returning to student life? The
other main wish was to get a good
degree. Only a few stood out from
the crowd, Bruce Patterson from
Computing wanted a motor bike,
his most recent reading material had
been On the Road by Jack Kerouac,
a connection perhaps? Most unusual
of all, Julian, who declined to
identify himself further, wished to
be able to see into the future.
Maybe this is bad time to take the
opinions of students, exams are
looming, morale will be at a low.
But I cannot ignore the feeling that
the image of Imperial projected to
those under its influence is not all
it could be. Can it be that students
when they come here are unhappy,
but stick it out for the good of their
careers? Maybe the unfortunate
stereotype that we all recognise is
necessary to preserve the
intellectual standing of the College.
But the fact remains, the IC student
is here in our midst, and we are not
entirely happy about it.
