Feature
of his goals in life was a 'Quest for
the Ultimate Lecture Notes', when
suddenly Adrian burst into the room
brandishing, a garden water-pump
and sprayed Morton with water. He
stopped, thought a minute, and then
sprayed me as well while he yelled
something about 'equality for all!'
A furious water-fight then
erupted in the corridors, revealing
that everybody had equipped
themselves with garden water-
pumps. As we recuperated in
Adrian's room over toasted malt
loaf, a third-year student gingerly
poked his head around the door
saying 'I'm look for Marcus Peron
as he's wanted on the phone.' 'Did
you say Marcus Peron, comrade?'
said Adrian helpfully, standing up.
'Yeah, that's right,' said the third-
year. Adrian thought carefully and
said 'Well, it ain't me,' and sat
down again. 'Nor me!' 'Or me!'
Next morning I met Marian on
the bus again. ' Y o , mama!' she
called out when she saw me. We
started talking about an action film
that had been on T V last night.
'Cheapskate' she sniffed. 'Why,
they had the kinda guns you'd
expect to find in the locker of your
average American high-school kid.'
She started slipping into her deeper
Southern drawl. 'And that hero—
the guy's a wimp! In fact, he was
so sick he makes me sick,' she
growled, flexing her biceps. 'Oh'
I said carefully, 'that's pretty sick.'
The weeks seemed to flash by.
During one Physiology practical,
we were all split into little groups
studying the effects of exercise. Bija
was acting as the test-subject for
Tetsuo's group and, perhaps
overexercising, suddenly collapsed.
His heart rate and blood pressures
all dropped through the floor.
Tetsuo was fascinted and kept
carefully recording the changes.
Only when the neighbouring table
noticed the prone form was any
assitance given. As we sat in
'Glady's' afterwards, Bija was still
embarrassed about the event.
Marian slapped him consolingly on
the shoulder and drawled 'I did just
the same when I was on 'crack' to
get over my PMT. Cheer up, it
could've been worse; why, you
might have been born a
Republican.'
One evening I saw an accident—a
young man was knocked down by
a car. I stopped to offer help, but
passers-by had already called an
ambulance. I told the guys about it
the next day. 'Maimed?' Morton
asked hopefully.
Our lecture schedule was timed
so we had our 'Sexual
Reproduction' lectures on
Valentines day. That weekend we
had our First Aid course with
Morton gleefully finding all the
ways people can die 'or be crippled
for life, like, wow!'
After lectures on Monday, I
relaxed in the hospital coffee shop
with Tetsuo and Bija. Tetsuo had
been describing the new generation
of Japanese cars. 'You know, if I
could have any car at all,' I said
dreamily, 'it would be a huge
Range-Rover with massive wheels.'
'Really?' said Bija. 'That's jolly
interesting. Did you know the
bigger a car somebody has, the
supposedly smaller their brain
capacity is?' 'But then again, Mini's
also have a certain something, don't
you think?' I asked. Tetsuo started
talking about how helpful London
people were. 'I got lost looking for
Japanese friends flat,' he confessed
Felix 965
'imagine it's a row of goblins, guys,
and you're lobbing a fireball' while
we played. He'd murmered mystic
chants each time before he'd
bowled, which he had learned from
the 'Necromicron' and the '20th-
Century Guide for Modern
Witches'. He still lost.
We struggled through a confusing
Anatomy lecture the following
morning. After it finished I found
myself talking to Julian, a boy who
had been gifted with two modes of
speech—gently sarcastic, and
complaining. 'Ah, you shop at
'Topman's',' said Julian, wisely.
Gordon said 'I'm going to write
some poetry about meaningful
relationships now.' Adrian loped
up, eating a malted loaf, and was
7 May 1993
consisted of breaking into her flat
in the 'Corridor of Faith',
ransacking her wardrobe, and
selling her clothes to shoppers at
Covent Gardens. Exasperated, I got
rid of Morton by saying 'Look,
something with a skirt and two legs
just walked around the corner,'—
he was off in a flash.
Later that day, Marian asked if
she could borrow my set of 'Cell
Biology' notes. I asked
apologetically if she might return
them before the weekend as I was
planning to go over them then.
'Yeah, of course', she drawled.
'Here, read-my-lips I promise I
will.'
More medical mayhem next
week.

and 'kind man only balcony shout
down instructions.' He grinned self-
consciously and said 'Problem is I
not understand them! M y English
not so good.' He frowned and asked
'What Bugger off and Go home
Chink mean?'
Leaving the hospital, I witnessed
Morton going up to a group of tired
nurses who had just finished their
shifts, and trying 'Hi babes. Come
here often?'
In our Anantomy Dissections we
had now reached our corpse's hand.
'Call-me-Mazza'-Syd gleefully
snipped about at its fingers, and we
found that by pulling tendons in the
wrist we could make the dead man's
fingers move and close and open.
It was eerie, I thought, while Syd
cracked a few jokes and guffawed,
mat night I went bowling with
Stephen and David, another old
friend from Imperial. For several
years now, Dave had been very
keen on ' Role-Playing-Games'.
Dressed in his 'Flower-Power' T-
shirt, he kept exhorting us to
genially curious. 'About what?' he
asked, amiably. 'Never mind, just
a comment beyond your education
and/or intelligence', dismissed
Gordon as he left. 'Okay' agreed
Adrian good-naturedly. 'How about
buying a copy of 'Socialist Worker'
instead?'
'Oh, by the way, Adrian,'
remarked Morton. 'You owe me £2
for giving in your practical write-
up together with mine.' Adrian
protested mildly and I left them
arguing. In the coffee-shop I met
Bija and Tetsuo. Tetsuo was
wondering about London life again.
'I see many men hang about outside
gent's toilet last night' he explained.
'Why they not go in? I ask one man
that. He give me strange look.
Think he be falling down—he put
hand on my arm.' A chuckling
Morton came up at this point and
hissed to me that he had a plan to
make money out of Alicia. Alicia
was a pleasant girl who sometimes
came in wearing very trendy and
exotic clothes. Morton's plan
