as no surprise to discover that the
Heartthrobs do 'brilliant' for a
living, i.e. they're f**kin ace.
Streams of guitar sounds weaved
together into steamed tunes, crisply
wreathed around watertight
rhythms and poignant singing. God,
it's gorgeous; frequently out-
musing the Muses, and yet at the
same time, considerably earthier. It
is this fallible corporeality which
made '91 's 'Total Abandon' E.P.
one of that year's more enduring
releases. A polkadot dress shot with
perspiration, recently elegant hair
now disturbed and straggly; it could
be Josephine rejected if it wasn't for
the guitar occasionally worn like a
heart on her sleeve. It's a lovely
soulful performance, and I am
delighted to see the audience agree.
A call for a second encore is politely
declined, and we leave it for that
most sombre of pleasures. A beer.
After witnessing our two
illustrious Ents Chairmen persuade
an indecent oik to leave before,
well, before he's ejaculated, I
suppose... Ahem... We go,
Onwards and Upwards, clutching
beers and belts, and dragging
ourselves over the sticky,
shimmering stairs to the concert hall
to wait for the legendary Pauline
Black. The concert hall really is
superb for atmosphere and
acoustics, and I was left feeling
somehow that the Heartthrobs had
got a raw deal, that if they had
played in the Concert Hall, they'd
have been unstoppable, but never
mind. I'm a professional, suffering
a professional's indignities, while
not being paid a professional's
salary. Selecter. Hold Tight.
The Vorpal Beaver, as our
resident photographic artiste wishes
to be known, contorts himself into
some quite incredible positions to
capture Pauline's steel-eyed Sturm
Und Drang as she commands first
the band, then the stage, then the
audience. She looks mean, vicious,
a booted brute-boy shrieking over
the sizzling funkpulses of a dozen
ska classics, including 'Too Much
Pressure', 'On M y Radio' and a
cover of'Madness'. Glory. Glory.
Lay it all on me. The audience, such
as it is, have space enough to kick
out, goose-step, frog-march,
whatever the fuck they want, so
long as they can call it dancing. I
employ the long-suffering
photographer to ever more unusual
angles for a few more shots before
giving up, giving in, and kickin' out
with the best of them. The
entertainment winds down, the
camera winds on, the crowd, newly
disorientated, wanders off to their
protection from the real world, oft-
even the vorpal beaver's complaints
had cheerful overtones. My thanks
to them. To Kerr-McCabe P L C ;
God's Zoo do their skankin' thing
times conveniently referred to as
'bed'. I'm sorry so few of you could
find the time to attend, but I enjoyed
myself, the razored and romantic
troubadour enjoyed himself, and
thanks, boys. It was a bit smart.

Next Week: What we promised you last week
Did they really call it 'Swing Ding'? Crap name. Also, what is meant by 'Skankin'?
