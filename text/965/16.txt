M e g a City 4 — M a g i c Bullets
The balance between lyrics and
melodies is a delicate one at the best
of times, but when even the arch-
wordsmith Bob Dylan produces ' A
Froggy Went A-Courting', you
know something is amiss in the
world we call popular music. Still
on 'Magic Bullets' MC4 do their
best to redress the Emperor in
presentable garb. No messing about
with tree feeding or spilling coffee
over Zurich here; this is standard
MC4 fare the personal stuff which
is the poetry of our generation. It's
unfortunate then that you have to
buy the album to get the wordsheet.
In strides the Emperor, proud of
his new found attire. Bold he
approaches his willing subjects.
Alas without belt or braces his final
embarrassment is even more accute
when his trousers end up round his
ankles. As a great man didn't say,
'function follows form'. Such is the
case in 'Magic Bullets' as the songs
are just not up to the words, with
'Greener' and 'Perfect Circle' being
bad examples. Great words, shame
about the face. When it does all
come together as in 'Wallflower',
'Toys' and 'Speck' you get an idea
of how it could be. 'Speck's' wistful
and almost folkish background
melts into the harmony vocals and
just lets Wizz tell us about getting
Felix 965
old. Then the album ends and I feel
cheated. The best song on last. In
his own words 'If only life was
fair.'.

The Fall: Couldn't you find an older photo? two of these guys are dead
now.
The Fall: T h e Infotainment
S c a n
Down in the sweaty bowels of
journo-land, us hacks prepare for
such moments as this by curling our
lips, adding the suffix 'ah' to the
end of every word, and smoking
lots. Uh-huh, uh-huh, here-ah we
go-ah; We're lost-ah in music-ah.
Another Fall album, after the
massive 'Code: Selfish', here again,
spitting out Mark E Smith's mouthy
humour to proliferate across the
earth (geddit-ah?) in ever-more
accessible ways. For instance,
Sister Sledge's 'Lost In Music' is
given the unique 'Fall-do-a-cover'
treatment, and the little pretty press
US1C
7 May 1993
darlings themselves come under
Smithy's lush and pithy scrutiny in
'Glam Racket': ' Y o u are
entrenched-ah in Suede-ah'. Can't
you just see Brett and Bernard
soaking up their perfect tears with
their silk hankies?
And that's not all, poppets, for this
immeasurably treasurable album
has more super lip-smackers than a
whole factory's worth of chocolate
willies; 'Why are People
Grudgeful?', 'The League of Bald-
Headed Men', 'I'm Going to Spain'
and the delightful 'It's a Curse', a
boot-print on the arse of nostalgic
(or anally retentive) seventies twats,
with lines like 'Vimto and Spangles
were crap', and god, yes! they're
right! You'd get red rim stains at
the corners of your mouth from
vimto, and spangles were
instrumental in the redundancy of
the late great boiled sweet. Yep, the
sour old bastard has still got his
finger on the pulse; and more than
ever, the Fall are looking like the
saviours of pop as an artform by
their very artlessness. Bloody
magnificent.

• Out now on Permanent. Kind of
ironic, that. 'Permanent'. The Fall
also play the Grand at Clapham
Junction on 15 & 16 May.
Polly Harvey: Knives out for the lads
P J Harvey: Rid of M e
Balls to the wall, sisters, lest they
be clipped off like corpsing shrubs
by the dirty secateurs of a girl
imagining she possesses a dick to
use them on. 'Rid of Me' is firstly
a masterpiece of marketing for left-
handed people (of all kinds), and
being of sinister leanings myself,
I'm happy about this. Secondly,
'Rid of Me' is a hugely powerful
record, the like of which hasn't
been seen since last year's debut
'Dry', and thirdly, I'm kind of
amused by the effect she has on
men.
The title-track sets the mood,
veering from affected calm to
explosive, and catching the listener
in mid-breath as the words 'lick my
legs, I'm on fire' are screeched in
the background; the stringed-up
'Man-size sextet' is one of the
scariest songs I've ever heard, I
even looked in the fridge to see if
my spine was in there (Actually,
that's a lie, but 'Man-size sextet' is
a real chilly song). Bobby D's
'Highway 61 revisited' and the
single '50 ft Queenie' are positive
light relief after that. 'Rid of Me'
has thus far exposed more of those
delicate little prejudices the music
media has painted on the front of its
nylon knickers. Sex sells records,
right? Right. How many people
confuse desirability with
respectability? Not many. Are all
pop stars then, tarts of a cheap and
dirty kind? Well, some are slightly
shop-soiled... Notable exceptions?
Hmm, difficult one, that; Sinead, I
suppose... So Sinead hasn't been
exploited for so many tabloid
column inches? Aha....
Ok, so Sinead shaves her head, and
screams, and rants and rails; hey
presto! one hundred thousand men
stand up, open their arms and think
'She's saying 'please understand
me". Polly Harvey looks like a
grubby-faced orphan-child straight
from the pages of Dickens, sings
nasty noisy songs about being hurt,
being fucked, and wordlessly
suggests how probable it is that both
will occur at the same time. Yeah,
she's a great female icon, a
blackeyed anti-Madonna, and this
is cool if you like your anti-social
figureheads as obviously dirty as
they can be, but what worries me
is that I don't know if she reaches
women with what she does; I would
like to believe it were so, but the
only people I know really listening
to PJ Harvey are lads, doing the
voyeur thing that lads do, and
dreaming of being humiliated by
her. A h , fuck it. Who am I to
question the way things are.
'Tarzan, I'm pleading, stop your
fucking screaming'- 'Me-Jane'
If you hadn't guessed already,
there's few things I find as
sickening as the modern variation
of the protective male, showered in
cheap aftershave and facsimile
sensitivity, nose anticipating the
smells of woman, eyes examining
the swells beneath the jumper. Polly
Jean is looking for that kind of
sympathy, too; she's sharpening the
spare on her castrate-o-matic just in
case she finds it.

• Out now on Island Records. This
is the last warning we will give you,
but P J Harvey play the London
Forum on the 23rd & 24th May.
Don't blame us if you can't get in.
