Josie Lawrence in a low-cut revealing dress.
M o l l Flanders
In the 18th century, Moll Flanders
was a lady of ill repute, a whore.
She was not like the 'on ya back
every night' whore, she was more
of a 'gold-digger' type whore ie she
married only for money in nearly
all of her five marriages.
The musical takes you from her
birth in a prison, and details, where
necessary, her fortunes and
misfortunes throughout her long
life: she travels around the country
and changes her name to Moll
Flanders shortly before going to
America. She spawns
approximately 10 children, all of
which she leaves with her husbands
to raise and steals money wherever
and whenever she finds it.
It is when an event occurs in
Moll's life that a song presents
itself. This gives the star, Josie

'Whose Line It Is Anyway?'
Lawrence, to show off her brilliant
and almost operatic voice. It has to
be said, her voice is sensual and
charming and I am in love with it.
One of the highlights of this two and
three quarter hour musical was
hearing Josie perform a solo every
now and then. Aaah, it gives such
delight to have ones ears caressed
with the beautiful voice of a
beautiful lady.
I hate to admit it but one or two
songs did drag on just a litde bit (not
the ones where Josie had solo's in,
I hasten to add), and the 'ensemble'
did ham them up a tad too much,
I thought. But on the whole this is
a musical that should be seen, if
only hear Josie sing.
