I T S TOP SECRET. Do you
| find life dull ? Have you a
craving for excitement ? Then
you need Carnival ?
No, this is not an advertisement for
a new pep pill, but an organisation
(joke) ded cated to raising money for
some charity chosen by YOU.
This year sees a new venture by
Carnival, namely a Rag Week from
6th to 13th November and for this
week we need Commando Groups.
These Groups consist of people who
are prepared to don strange clothes
and wave collecting tins at wealthy-
looking queues of people—e.g. out-
side the Albert Hall, Theatres or
Cinemas.
In the past the Commandoes have
wheedled, cajoled or scared consider-
able sums out of people waiting in
queues. If you are interested, contact
Chris Hocking (Room 662, Selkirk
Hall) . . . .no previous experience
necessary, great variety of scene and
you meet lots of people.
In addition to these Commando
Groups we also need many other
people to help and to organise but
perhaps most important is that we
need YOUR ideas, remember it is
YOUR Carnival.
LOOKING AROUND
[REEDOM 7, the spacecraft
in which Commander Alan
Shepard made the first manned
Mercury flight on 5 May, 1961,
has been on public view at the Sci-
ence Museum since 12.30, Wednes-
day, 6 October. This "star attrac-
tion " is to remain at the Science
Museum until the end of February.
The exhibition also includes a set of
panels provided by the U.S. Informa-
tion Services which give details of the
United States lunar and manned space
flight programmes. The opportunity
is given to observe at first hand many
of the features which have been found
essential for manned spaceflight—
capsule attitude controls, environment
requirements for the astronaut, com-
munication between the capsule and
the ground, etc.
Other news from the Science
Museum includes the recent opening
of the new Time Measurement Gallery,
completion of the Meteorology Col-
lection and a display of samples of
new high-voltage electricity cable
from the U.S. which will be put on
show as soon as they have obtained
customs clearance.
