ON ICWA

Botanist, was appointed Presi-
dent of IC Women's Association

through exam failures and the advice
of her department.

GOVERNMENT CURB
HITS SPORT CENTRE

AlsoDelayed
by D. I. WILLIAMS
THE ANNOUNCEMENT by
Mr. James Cilla?han, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer,
in July of a country-wide clamp-
down on capital expenditure has
led to further delays in the com-
mencement of construction of
the Sports Centre and East Side
Hall of Residence.
But the Princess Gardens de-
velopments are not alone in being
put back. Reinforcement of the
Queen's Tower—ordered by an
earlier Government decision—
was due to start last month.
The College Block develop-
ment on the Central Site, due to
begin next year, is now also ex-
pected to be delayed indefinitely.
The actual construction of the new
Hall does not of course, rely upon
Government expenditure, though the
former University Grants Committee
was to be licensed.
However, unless work has already
started on 24 May next year the quar-
ter million pounds donation that was
to finance the construction of East
Side will be withdrawn.
The Secretary of the College, Mr.
M. J. Davies, did suggest to me that
there was some hope that these pro-
jects would not be much further de-
layed, since a number of smaller
schemes have been approved.
Among these are new buildings at
Silwood and rationalisation of the E
block of Mechanical Engineering and
the west side of Beit Block.
Both South Kensington projects
will lead to expansion of the existing
Mech, Eng. and Botany and Zoology
departments through, respectively the
opening of a new wing and the trans-
fer of the Biochemistry Department.

FULL STRENGH
FOR THE FIRST time ever IC
Union's Executive has begun the
academic year at its full 6-man
s'rength. Other organisations do not
feel so happy, however. The exam-
iners slashed RCS Entertainments
Committee by half and removed th'i
Guilds' Vice-President ; IC Ents are
also feeling the push.

FRESHERS DINNERS
GET A NEW LOOK
TO IMPROVE staff-student relationships, the President of City
and Guilds Union, Cai Howells, is going to reorganise Freshers
Dinners. Drunken orgies in the bar following the dinners are
out as these have led to staff not
willing to come.
New look Freshers Dinners will
begin with sherry in the Senior
Common Room and a sober
dinner with wine instead of beer.
The rest of the evening will be
spent in the SCR where freshers
and staff will be able to chat over
coffee or a " quiet half-a-pint."

Education."
Even the- date of this proposed visit
had been tentatively set for the end
of November, and FELIX had
planned to devote a whole-page fea-
ture to him.
Discussions had been under way
since early June, but it took Lord
("Corridors of Power") Snow three
months to decide that he could not in
fact manage any but official engage-
ments.

Instead of only the second year
students acting as hosts there will
be many more staff invited and
various prominent members of
the Guilds Union, plus a sprink-
ling of second and third years.
The cost of the dinners is to be
met by both the staff and the
Union.
