Hockey Trials
The first batches of the new season
are being played this Saturday at
Merton Hockey Club. These matches
are very hard and fast and should be
a good test for the Freshers playing
in their first college match. There is
another trial next Wednesday at Har-
lington where teams will take on a
more definite form. In addition there
will be'a coaching session in the near
future with the Middlesex Hockey
Association, at Harlington.
PINS AND PIES
F O U R - P I N T C A N S of beer and
hot pies are now available at both

if the demand does not arise.

down to Ghana across the Sahara

College Union Yearbook, Felix
points out that the College Book-
stall is the only official stockist of
IC Union scarves, blazers, etc. It is
to your own benefit to trade with
the I C bookstall, since its profits are
ploughed into the Union.
DID YOU PAY?
IA S T Ye.ar Felix lost about
£2 per edition through dis-
honesty among its subscribers.
Apart from money actually be-
ing stolen from our newsstands—
which is infrequent, but did happen
on at least three occasions (in each
case involving sums of around £1)—•
there are people in the habit of tak-
ing free copies or underpaying.
Reduced receipts necessarily lead
to a smaller Felix, for total losses
through this cause last year could
have bought us a new typewriter or
at least four more pages without any
advertising !
Did you pay for your Felix ? Did
he pay for his Felix ?
