F E L I X 3
SNOW FOILS
MONT BLANC BID
by GREG TOUGH
THE I.C. MOUNTAINEERING CLUB Alpine Meet took place
during August at Chamonix in the French Alps. In spite of
being one of the worst seasons in recent years, they managed
to complete some routes without any major accidents.
In the first week there was not
much success, an attempt by P. Scott
and P. Hawthorne on the Mer de
Glace Face of the Grepon in the
Chamonix Aiguilles ending in defeat.
Yet all but P. Roberts, A. Marie and
G. Tough, who were in Zertnatt at
the time, managed an enjoyable climb
of the N.W. Ridge of the Aiguille
de I'M.
Subsequently the weather and the
conditions of the snow became very
treacherous but a few routes were
managed. There was only one minor
accident where R. Rowe had a slight
fall on the glacier above the Converde
Hut, while returning from a success-
ful attempt on the Eveque with K.
Harrison, a member of Leeds Univer-
sity.
Other completed routes included the
East Face Direct of the Aiguille du
Moine (G. Tough and P. Scott),
Conzy route on the Aigulle le I'M
G. Tough and " Jug" Jarvis,
a Mountaineering Association Instruc-
tor), and the West Face of the Pointe
Albert (P. Scott and A. Legge). The
last of these climbs is Extrement
Difficile, the highest Alpine grading,
showing that some of the members are
as competent in the Alps as on Welsh
Rock.
Violent snow storms foiled an at-
tempt by Tough and Jarvis to make
the third British ascent of the North
Face of the Aiguille du Triolet. Haw-
thorne, in his first alpine season,
ascended the Aiguille d'Argentiere
with his own party—a big undertaking
at anytime.
After a mammoth unsuccessful at-
tempt on Mont Blanc, the party
packed up and left for Britain, arriv-
ing back on the 24th of September.
Although there were many disappoint-
ments, the club had an enjoyable
meet. The president would like to
thank the new club van for making
the journey there and back so trouble
free.
Union
Lounge
Redecorated
THE LOWER LOUNGE of the
Union Building is to be offi-
cially reopened by the Rector,
Sir Patrick I in lead, on Friday
at 5.30.
The redesign has led to many im-
provements in the furnishing, lighting
and services of the lounge. Perhaps
the most important innovation is the
extension of the bar, which will
serve sherry and cocktails as well as
beer, so making the Union Bar, or at
least a branch thereof, amenable to
women.
More room for Engineers—
Mech. Eng. Extension
Gas in the
North Sea
THE RECENT DISCOVERY by
British Petroleum of gas off our
shores should draw many to at
least one of the talks—on Drill-
ing in the North Sea—this year
planned by the City and Guilds En-
gineering Society.
Other talks will include Gas Tur-
bine Cars by the Rover Car Co., Fuel
Cells by the Royal Navy and Atomic
Energy. The term starts with a talk
by Professor Sparkes on 12 October.
The society—to which membership
is automatic for all members of
C & G Union—aims to bridge the
gap between the theoretical, academic
engineering taught in the college and
the practical engineering of industry.
Visits will be made to the Shell
Haven oil refinery, Fords of Dagen-
ham, Watney's brewery and the
Decca Record Company.

CRUSH BAR
NEGOTIATIONS are still in pro-
gress to make the Crush Bar (outside
the Union Concert Hall) a permanent
fixture.
WHO'S WHO
IC UNION is to have its first-ever
direrctory of Union, club and
society officials and is due for
publication within the first three
weeks of term.
. By this means the Union Executive
hope to make it easier for anyone
to contact such officials. Its success,
however, will depend largely upon the
response of the clubs to Union Secre-
tary Phil Dean's requests for infor-
mation by 18 Pcto'^r.
