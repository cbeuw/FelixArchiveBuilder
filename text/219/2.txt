2 FELIX
Consort Reactor
opened at Silwood
THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON'S Nuclear Reactor was
officially opened at the Imperial College Field Station at Silwood
Park, near Ascot in Berkshire, on 22nd June by the Rt Hon.
Lord Sheffield, Chairman of the Governing Body.
In his opening address Lord Sher-
field, who as Sir Roger Makins was
until 1964 chairman of the UK
Atomic Energy Authority, praised
the "enlightened policy of the last
Government in making this scheme
possible " by making a grant in 1962
of over £200,00-9 for five years.
The 100-kilowatt Consort Reactor,
which first became critical on 9 April
and-achieved full power operation on
18 May, is fuelled with highly-enriched
uranium, moderated and cooled with
water.
DESIGNED AT IC
It was designed jointly by the
Nuclear Power Group of I.C. and the
General Electric Company. Its con-
trol and safety instrumentation, which
ensures that at least three safety cir-
cuits are always in use, was designed
by Elljott Automation.
The two people most directly re-
sponsible for the reactor and its suc-
cessful functioning are Dr. P. J. Grant,
Reader in Engineering Science, and
Mr. M. Kerridge, the Reactor Mana-
ger.
-Consort will enable research and
training in nuclear engineering and
applied nuclear science to be carried
out by the colleges and medical
schools of the University as well as
other educational institutions in the
London area.

FEARS that "'Wonderful Radio
Tizard" may close due to lack
of support have proved un-
founded. Southside resident.
can once again look forward this
year to 'regular, vital programming
besides the continuous music service.
The only apparatus required is an
amplifier or radio set, but many pro-
grammes are of such high quality that
the signals deserve hi-fi equipment to
do them full justice. Of course, any
subscriber can transmit his own pro-
grammes if he has a record player,
tape recorder or FM tuner.
In the past, W.R.T. has been
featured in FELIX and an architects
journal. Also, a full expose will be
shortly appearing in " The Tape
Recorder." This year further strides
are bound to be made, so be " IN "
fronfthe start. There is sure to be a
BIG demand for connection, so con-
tact Jerry Stockbridge (612 Tizard) or
Rog Leaman (476 Selkirk) as soon as
possible to avoid disappointment.
JAZZ ON A
SUMMER'S DAY
THE JAZZ CLUB'S year begins in a remimniscent mood with an
innovation. For at the first meeting on 20th October they are to
show the film "Jazz on a Summer's Day."
In the' main, however, the year's •
busy programme will be run along
similar lines to those of previous
years. There are to be " live " Cellar
Sessions, lunchtime record recitals
and, of course, Southside Stomps.
The Jazz Club is open to all,
whether musicians or not. To musi-
cians the advantages of joining are
obvious—the club means to form at
least one new band this year, and new
blood will be required for this.
To non-musficians the advantages
are mainly financial, for although
most of the club's functions are open
to all the admission fees are lower to
members.
If you have not already joined, you
can easily do so by contacting the
president, Al Friend, via the Union
rack or by going to the Jazz Room
(above ICWA lounge) any lunchtime.

greatest
of the
Huxley Society have prpomised an exciting year.
It is to include a talk from Profes-
sor Denis Gabor on the threats and
blessings of automation, and joint
meetings with the IC Catholic and
Communist Societies.
This term's programme opens with
a talk on reform of the abortion law
by Mrs. Diane Munday, who was an
imt>ressive and moving speaker before
UL Humanists earlier this year.
The British Humanist Association
has established tentative links with
the Vatican. It is in the same spirit
that Catsoc has called for a joint
meeting to search for common
ground.
REINFORCEMENT
The Catholics are to be reinforced
with women from other colleges and
they tell me that—as at normal Hux-
soc meetings—there will be a coffee
party afterwards for informal discus-
sion.
The IC humanists' society is named
after Thomas Henry Huxley, one-time
Professor of Biology here and the
man who drew Darwin's religious con-
clusions for him. Later this term
Huxsoc will hammer out "Evolution
or Revolution in Society " with Com-
soc.
To round off the term the society
hopes to hold a sherry party. If you
have not joined yet, come to Friday's
Freshers' Tea or contact Dave Dunn
(Physics 3) via the Union rack.

WESKER
COME TO I.C.
IMPERIAL COLLEGE IS CRIPPLED by its lack of an art faculty.
Because of this, and its general remoteness from the rest of the
University, there is little opportunity for its members to meet
people with much experience of culture.
In this unhealthy atmosphere it is
easy for the desire .to find out about
literature to subside when the student
meets a greater pressure of work.
The Literary Society exists to com-
bat this problem. It is about 3 years
old, an inconspicuous and very minor
group. Now, however, drastic internal
change's have occurred, a current of
new enthusiasm has come about, and
a vigorous programme of meetings is
planned for the coming year.
We intend to hold a meeting on
every Wednesday of the term, in the
Staff Common Room, level 8, Electri-
cal Engineering Building, at 7.30 p.m.
Taking a fearful risk we have arranged
to have prominent writers, specialists
in literarv affairs, and also a modern
at these meetings. Our
is to produce stimulating
composer,
chief aim
discussions but these will be proceeded
usually by a talk" by the guest.
Our first meeting, on October 13th,
has as its visitor the playwright
ARNOLD WESKER, best known as
the author of " Chips with Every-
thing." You don't actually have to
have read any literature to join the
society.
We're not particularly interested in
collecting your membership fees—
this is something we're forced to do.
However, we are very anxious to have
a large and active gathering at our
meetings. You can join the literary
Society at itsfirstmeeting.
