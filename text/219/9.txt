WELCOME BACK. I trust that all you
sportsmen (and women) have spent the vac
training hard and have not still got a coat-
of last season's mud on your boots.
Now, a word to the Freshers—The best IC Union has
to offer is to be found amongst our sports clubs.
Here informality is the keynote and there is a place
for everybody, whatever their standard.
Most clubs have as many teams as are required to
accommodate all their members—not vice versa. The
best way to fill a Wednesday or Saturday afternoon
is in the company and friendship of an IC sports
team—many think it the only way.
' non sportsmen »
THE HIGH ACADEMIC stan-
dard of Imperial College tends
to militate against its sporting
standard since studying for
one's GCEs takes precedence over
perfecting off-drives in the use of
free time.
So we inherit a larger proportion of
" 'non-sportsmen than many other
colleges. This therefore puts an
onus on club captains and secre-
taries to reap the most from the
talent they have
It is not enough to organise the same
matches and training sessions as
last year and wait for people to turn
up. If members are to turn out
twice a week, wet or dry, then they
want to. enjoy themselves off the
field as well as on.
Such things do not just happen. They
depend upon the personality and
effort of the club officials who,
having accepted their posts, must
sacrifice the necessary times and
effort that go with it.

NEW WINTER LEAGUE
ALTHOUGH ATHLETICS is mainlv a summer sport there are
to be several competitions—including the new University of
London Winter League—in the coming months. Next summer
the Athletics Club not only has a full list of fixtures to provide the
ideal escape from exam worries but also is trying to organise a tour
ojf Germany.
But the college team is only one
aspect of the club. As a freshen-
who
is already a keen and training ath-
lete you have no doubt made your-
self acquainted with it at the Freshers'
Day exhibition.
What about those of you who have
not seen a running track or javelin
since leaving school? No matter what
your standard is now there is room
for all, and in all but the very biggest
competitions the chance to run, jump
or throw is given to everyone who
wants it.
The start of the Hyde Park Road Relay, one of ICs big sporting
events. The race draws university teams from all over the country.
YOU MUST BE MAD
WHO, OTHER THAN A LUNATIC, would spend every Satur-
day and Wednesday afternoons staggering around the country-
side through blizzard, fog and flood. However, there is always
a personal triumph, when, despite the numerous Acts of God that
are combated en route, you crawl the
last few yards of a race to finish
746th, which in some translations
might appear devoid of honour.
But, one might remember, the gen-
tlemen whose corpse you crawled
over in thatfightingfinish.He would
be placed 747th should his soul
march on posthumously.
In its travels I.C.'s Cross-Country
Club visits Oxford, Cambridge,
Mountain Ash, the Peak District,
Brighton, Sandhurst, and plans are in
hand for a continental fixture. Lon-
don matches take us to Hampstead,
Twickenham, Barnet, Shenley and to
our home course at Richmond Park.
Our most important event is the
Hyde Park Road Relay. We orga-
nize this race, which is effectively the
national college relay championships.
It is always intensely exciting and per-
haps you are the person to help the
club return to the form, which made
us winners three years ago.
"We welcome all types of runners—
fast, medium, slow, very slow and
crawlers. I don't think I'm sticking
my neck out by suggesting you come
in one of these categories and if so
we need you. For more details see
our notice board just outside the
Union Bar, or contact the secretary
Alan Walker through the Union
hole.

And why don't some of you burly
rugger, soccer or rowing men make
athletics your second sporting string?
The speed and strength developed for
your main sport is ideal for the sprints
and throwing events—which also
makes good training for your first
string.
The standards—even in U.L.—may
surprise you in being so low; nowhere
near such world records as 9.1 sees,
300ft. llins., lm. 45.1s., 7ft. 5iins..
12m. 52.4s., and 67ft. lOins. And even
if you're not sure to which events
thesefiguresrefer the club will wel-
come you.
Don't stagnate in the cT season.
Join the athletics club now. You can
make contact via the club noticeboard,
the Union Rack or Frank Hobson in
Falmouth Hall.

Rowing
FREE TRIAL
ROWING IS ONE of this College's major sporting activities. For
some years now the IC Boat Club has been the most successful
in the University of London.
1964/5 was a reasonably good sea-
son, but new members are urgently
needed if the club's standard is to
be bettered, even maintained. Those
who have rowed before are very wel-
come, but experience is not essential.
A further incentive is offered in
the form of a month's free trial so
that prospective members may see if
they like rowing and if it fits in with
their other pursuits.
The boathouse, on Putney Embank-
ment, has really excellent facilities,
ranking among the best in the country.
For exercise, healthy relaxation, and
friendship you should seriously con-
sider taking up rowing or sculling.
Small, lightweight men are always
required as coxswains, who may also
row and scull if they wish. Coxes
qualify for a special reduced annual
subscription, at which (at 2 gns. for all
other members) is considerably less
t'lan the fee for any other club of its
type in the home counties.
BILLIARDS & SNOOKER
T
HE ABILITY TO PLAY Billi-
ards or Snooker is said to be a
sign of a mio-^ent youth, and
for all who wish to put this
amongst their achievements the I.C.
Billiards and Snooker Club offers the
facilities of two c.vcellent tables during
normal Union hours. The tables may
be booked by Club members one day
in advance.
Professional coaching during tta
last year, greatly improved the sta.i-
,dard of -play and we entered two suc-
cessful teams in the Snooker League of
the London Business Houses Amateur
Association. Similar teams are in-
tended for this year and it is hoped
that all interested will take advantage
of the coaching whether beginners or
competent players.
