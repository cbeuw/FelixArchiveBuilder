SIR WILLIS
SCORES A HIT
THE HEAD of the Electrical
Engineering Department,
Professor Sir Willis Jackson,
recently wrote a most im-
pressive foreward to the N.U.S.
publication "Choosing a Career."
This booklet is now in short supply
due to an unexpectedly large demand.
He has also been approached by the
Scottish Union of Students to write a
similar introduction.
Another IC man to have contribu-
ted to this year's N.U.S. careers
booklet is Derek Otley, formerly of
the Royal School of Mines.

The Christians
BEFORE VERY LONG you will
notice a fairly large Indian
priest wandering around the
college and Halls of Residence.
You will begin to wonder who he is.
He is known in the area as Father
Ivor, but his real name is Ivor Smith-
Cairieron.
His favourite maxim for clergymen
is "stand up, spea.. up and shut up! !"
His friends in the college,—and they
are numerous—include " Stan the
Man," " Sherrie " " the Spanish ladies
in the Snack Bar," and Tony Lewis
in the Maintenance Department! !
It is worth getting to know him, if
only on the grounds of the old adage
" the devil you know is better than
the devil you don't."
WHICH JOHN ? " I don't
know his name, but I
think he is either a chemist
or a physicist or something,
average height, medium build,
and speaks with a slight Welsh
accent."
Su^h problems—though not all
are so vague—present themselves
daily to Stanley Branker. He has
been our Union porter for six years
—quite a long time for him to stay
anywhere, but he says he likes it
here. As a whole he has quite a
good opinion of students, though
sometimes they can be rather trying.
The son of a Barbadoes business
man, he studied classics at school,
and eventually started his working
life as a school teacher. Two years of
this, however, convinced him that
teaching was not the career for him,
being neither lucrative nor sufficiently
interesting to one who yearned for a
more adventurous life. Far horizons
were beckoning, and it was natural
that he should try his hand at life
afloat.
His mother had been a concert
pianist, and Stan himself had played
the piano from an early age, so that
he joined the Canadian National
Steamship Line as a pianist, in 1937,
on their luxury cruises. He sailed
with this line for four years and
managed to see a great deal of the
world before his employment was ab-
ruptly ended when his ship was tor-
pedoed off Burmuda at the beginning
of the war.
This seemed like a good cue for a
change of profession and he went to
Curacao in the Dutch West Indies
where he trained as a cracking unit
operator with the Shell Oil Company.
After the war Stan re-joined the
Merchant Navv as a steward for a
short time.
But soon he was off again on his
wanderings, this time roaming about
North America, trying his hand at a
variety of jobs, working most of the
time at his old trade, playing the
piano in night clubs.
However in 1955 he had ambitions
of studying Law so he decided to
come to England. During his sailing
days Stan had visited most of the
world, and had come to the conclu-
sion that England was the only place
to live, in spite of the weather.
Before coming to IC in 1959 Stan
worked for a time in a Brewery.
Later he joined the Decca Radio and
TV Company and also managed to
put in three years part-time service
with the Territorial Army.
He has not altogether dismissed his
past accomplishments for whilst he
has been here he has played profes-
sionally at the Engineers Dinner and
Dance and the ICWA Formal.
You cannot tell a book by its cover.
So, too, would you perhaps not ex-
pect such a varied past to Stan the
affable man at the Union door.
