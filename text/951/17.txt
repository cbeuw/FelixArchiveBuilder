The Improfessionals
I have one slight problem with
supposedly improvised comedy. It
always seems the same. Despite of,
or maybe because of, the stupid,
sometimes sureal, often just plain
stupid suggestions the audience
come out with, the night invariably
ends up being based around fish.
Tonight they break this eternal rule.
And it was still funny.
A four piece outfit, nattily turned
out in red, white and black, stroll
through the standard fomulas
producing some rather patchy
results. It's not until the second
half, with the written suggestions
that things work. As always the best
laughs come from the mistakes, the
times when three have no idea what
the fourth is going on about.
Good value entertainment, what
better thing could you do on a
Monday night.

Annie Get Your Gun
Petticoats and pantaloons jostle with
cliches and stereotypes in this feel-
good 'for-all-the-family'
spectacular. Gutsy, busty Annie
Oakley (Kim Gresswell) takes us on
a sequin-spangled romp through the
old musical chestnuts. She
discovers that a) there's no biz like
showbiz b) all men are bastards c)
the only way to get a 'may-an'
(man!) is not, 'with a gun' but to
be, 'as pink and soft as a nursery'
and d) if you repeat a melody for
fifty verses the audience has no
option but to leave whistling the
tune. Lavish, slickly changing,
sugar-sweet sets and costumes
together with an immaculately
drilled chorus, dispell the potential
banality of the show, with its
cringe-worthy story and lyrics.
Skilled dancing, refreshing
choreography and delightfully
enthusiastic singing detract from
some of Berlin's most boring
balads. The real gem is Kim
Cresswell's engaging Annie. She is
a joy to watch with her strong,
beautiful voice and ebullient acting.
Puzzling then, that the mayan she
lurves sings like a drain and looks
like Rod Stewart...

Macbeth
Macbeth is Shakespeare's most
infamous tragedy. The play is a
history of feudal Scotland in the
middle ages where Kings ruled by
violence. The drama revolves
around power, ambition, violence
and blood.
Macbeth kills the King of
Scotland after hearing three
witches' prophecy that he will
become the next king. But life is
never simple—he is haunted by the
ghost of a former ally whom he
ordered to be killed, Lady Macbeth
dies and Macbeth is finally slain by
Macduff—a man 'not of woman
born'.
I have to say of the Bard's works,
Macbeth is not my favourite play,
but the internationally acclaimed
English Shakespeare Company
provide a unique and innovative
interpretation and exhiliarating
performance. The actors will
captivate you making it very easy
to follow.
If you like intense drama, action,
strong characters interwoven in the
subjects of government, war and
politics this one's for you.

Speed the Plow
Speed the Plow
If you have ever wanted to see a
play that showed what a bunch of
over-paid over-emotional and back-
stabbing bastards the American film
executives are, then this is for you.
Set in Bobby Gould's office, (head
of production at the unnamed
studios), David Mamet's play
focuses on the friendship between
Bobby Gould and his best friend,
Charlie Fox, and the way in which
scripts are selected to be turned into
films. A lot of the time, perhaps too
much, is devoted to how smug the
film executives are in their attitude
towards selecting the next
blockbuster and also their 'we-
The Tempest
Annie Get Your Gun.
Michael Bogdanov's ambitious
production of the Tempest
highlights the play's complexities
without over-simplifying the issues.
The questions of love, greed,
utopianism, mastery and noblesse
oblige are given a modern
backdrop. New co-exists with old
and we arrive at timelessness
making the relevance of this play no
less potent than in Shakespeare's
time.
John Woodvine presents, at the
beginning, a cold, calculating
Prospero who grows in self-
knowledge and compassion. Olwan
Fouere's androgynous Ariel, with
echoed songs and slow moves,
create another world—one of spirits
and magic. In total contrast
Trinculo (Tony Haygarth) and
Stefano (Sean Baker) are hilarious.
The Tempest is a play that
depends upon atmosphere and
certainly this production provided
plenty. Dry-ice aside, the phantoms
and ghosts were breathtaking, not
least because of their simplicity.
The E S C combines Shakespeare
with movement, haunting melodies,
and modern effects, and yet remains
true to the text!
Unlike many theatrical
endeavours, this production
rewards the audience with a final
scene which, as it is enacted, is the
natural, satisfying, and thoughtful
know-what-makes-a-good-film-
because-we've-been-in-show-
business-for-a-hell-of-a-long-time'
attitude.
The cast are absolutely brilliant
and the American accents are spot
on. Any humour is rarely
superficial and most of it can be
found by analysing the words of the
cast carefully.
Do not go if you hate American
accents since they are very strong
in this play and also if you object
to over use of swear words.

Trojan women
Trojan Women is a modern
adaptation of an ancient Greek
tragedy written by Euripides and
recently translated by Stephen
Sharkey.
The play is about the despair,
anguish and anger of the women of
the ancient city of Troy after a ten
year war with the Greeks. The
deposed queen of Troy, Hecuba
(Ann Roper) leads the mourning for
lost husbands and children.
The director Peter Kenvyn has
given a modern flavour to the
tragedy. It is not simply an unusual
setting of the play, actors have to
perform amongst piles of
contemporary rubble representing
the destroyed Troy but also
suggesting any other town after a
long war. In fact the play relates
very much with the situation in the
Middle East as is suggested by a
picture dominating the stage,
depicting mourning Arabic women.
