No More Sex War
Mimi Chakraborty, reads a lot into a book that tried to change the world.
Once in a while, out of the big blue,
a book comes along which
challenges the currency of accepted
thought, overturns ingrained pre-
conceptions, and effectively
radicalises a generation. One such
book was Kate Milletts' 'Sexual
Polities', and another, Germaine
Greer's 'The Female Eunnuch'.
When in September 1992 Neil
Lyndon published 'No More Sex
War: The Failures of Feminism',
it's clear he hoped it would be a
third. Lyndon promised that 'No
More Sex War' would be 'the
earthquake which would succeed in
shattering the feminist myth'.
In America, the men's movement
has achieved no small degree of
prominence, particularly in the last
couple of years, with the
consciousness raising groups of
Robert Bly's 'Iron lohn' attracting
wide public support. In Britain,
however, Neil Lyndon has penned
the first attempt at a truly
destructive attack on feminism from
someone not on the right of the
political spectrum. Lyndon, an ex-
Times journalist in his mid-forties,
proposes to prove without doubt
'That the feminist movement has
... the feminist
movement had
gone fishing
circa 1979 and
never
returned...
not only of itself failed, but that its
effects had been so far-reaching and
insiduous that it had threatened the
very destruction of an entire
generation.'
Anyone who (like myself)
thought that the feminist movement
had gone fishing circa 1979 and
never returned, will find 'No More
Sex War' a surprise. Specifically
his invocation of a 'maniacal
feminist sisterhood', powerful
enough to reorder society
The thesis of Lyndon's debate lies
in his claim that it is men and not
women, who are discriminated
against by the legal system, by
society and by the economy. He
seeks to expose the 'feminist
conspiracy' within the courts, and
goes on to extrapolate this
conspiracy through every level of
society, to the extent that he feels
that men have become
disenfranchised, second-class
citizens.
Lyndon goes on to say that the
successes of women in the last thirty
years, relative to all centuries
previous, were entirely, not partly,
attributable to increased access to
higher education, contraception and
abortion. These were all available
to women some years before Kate
Millett wrote 'Sexual Polities', the
ppint in time which Lyndon locates
as the genesis of the feminist
movement. This one semantic point
is in itself sufficient for Lyndon to
feel he can deny the validity of the
entire women's movement.
However, though Millett's work
was very significant in the history
of feminism, is ludicrous to suggest
that it was its origin. Mary
Wolstencroft's 'Vindication of the
Rights of Woman' was written
more than a hundred years before
Millett was even born. In any case,
the suffragette movement was
nothing if not a galvanisation of
women demanding their rights, and
the experience of two world wars
pre-empted much social change
which Lydon is happy to overlook.
Nevertheless, these are the points
that Neil Lyndon has elected to
make, and it is worth taking time
to express them blandly, without the
associated rhetoric with which the
book is suffused. The most striking
..referring to
women as
hoods... and to
feminism as the
'Great
Terror'...
thing about this book; is not the
paucity of argument, but the
venemous subjectivity of the
language. Lydon consistently refers
to women as 'hoods' (sisterhood),
and to feminism as the 'Great
Terror'. He declares himself to be
'sick to the back teeth of being
fucked over by tiresomely angry
women'. He casually offers his
opinion on feminist equality as 'that
towering edifice of bullshit'. After
such choice morsels as 'my entire
adult life has been spent under the
influence of this poisonous
orthodoxy' he insists that 'I can find
few things more serious in our
society than the presence amongst
us of a totalitarian group,
legitimated (sic) by fashion, office
and place, whose wicked and vain
orthodoxies are influencing the
operations of the courts and of
commerce and are inhibiting
expression in all its most compelling
forms.'
Lyndon's message threatens to
lose itself in the pomposity of its
own language, he seems to have a
cosy fondness for quasi-marxist
comparisons, where almost
anything he can get his hands on is
described as some kind of
totalitarian hegemony. This is a sad
reflection on a persistent theme
within the book. It might nave been
big in the sixties to transcribe
marxist ideologies onto any
organisation, but it's a bit silly now,
even marxists aren't maxists any
more, and even radical baby
boomers are going to have to kiss
that particular fantasy goodbye. The
sixties present Lyndon with a host
of problems that he seems unable
to come to terms with, the shock of
the explosion of feminism and the
indignity of having his
consciousness forcefully raised,
being but two. These perhaps offer
valuable clues as to why he is so
angry, and he lays the blame
squarely at the feet of his
