Alarm Failure Chair's Birthday
by Declan Curry
Repairs to the fire alarm system in
the Union Building have been made
following a fire alert in the early
hours of last Saturday morning.
During the alert, it was found that
magnetically locked 'maglocked'
fire escape doors stayed shut. These
doors are supposed to open
automatically when Beit Quad fire
alarms sound.
The door lock failure is being
blamed on a drop in voltage across
the relays in the locks. Fire
contractors ASF replaced the relays
in the system on Monday of this
week, and M r Rick Bilby, Union
Deputy President, says that the
doors 'are now working'. Mr Bilby
described the door lock failure as
'seriously worrying.'
The drama began at three minutes
past one last Saturday morning,
when a fire glass outside the Union
Bar was broken. The fire control
panel in the Beit Quad security
lodge indicated a fire in the Union
Building, and College and Union
security began an immediate
evacuation. Beit Quad Hall of
Residence was also evacuated.
Within less than a minute, Union
stewards found that the emergency
exits outside the Felix office and
outside the Traditional Bar were
still locked. College security were
informed, and were asked to open
the doors with a key. While waiting
for College security to arrive
through the packed Da Vinci's Bar,
stewards attempted to force open
the door outside the Bar.
Other Union stewards and Bar
staff meanwhile evacuated Da
Vinci's and the Traditional bar.
Customers report that the alarm in
Da Vinci's was 'barely audible',
while bar staff in the Traditional Bar
were only aware of a fire alert after
being informed by other staff, as the
Traditional Bar alarm did not
sound. Customers complained
afterwards that the lights in the
Traditional Bar were abruptly
extinguished, causing mild panic.
Ents stewards evacuated the Ents
lounge, while Union stewards
checked all floors of the Union
building above the ground floor.
Fire evacuation routes on upper
floors were created by unlocking
the table tennis and snooker rooms,
and the concert hall. Students left
the Union building by the central
doors on the ground floor, with Bar
customers being evacuated past the
catering area, a possible fire zone.
The snack bar, along with Da
Vinci's and the Traditional Bars,
had ceased trading before the alert
began. Over 600 people were in the
Union building at the time of the
alert.
College security opened the
magnetically locked fire escapes
five minutes after the alarms
sounded, easing congestion at the
main central doors. Concern has
been expressed over the crush of
people which developed near to
these ground floor doors. In an
article in this morning's Felix, M r
Bilby writes that the evacuation was
completed 'in a longer time than I
would consider satisfactory',
adding that 'in the event of a real
fire, such a delay could have
extremely serious consequences'.
On IC Radio last Monday, he said
that the crush at the doors meant 'it
took fifteen minutes to evacuate the
building, when ideally one would
have it evacuated in about five'. A
full check of the building had been
made after seven minutes, and the
building was fully evacuated
thirteen minutes after the alert
began. Alarms were finally

switched off at 1.20am.
Of four main fire exits, only one,
the central doors, was used for most
of the alert. The magnetically
locked doors outside the Felix office
and outside the Traditional Bar
were not opened until five minutes
after the start of the evacuation. It
is unclear if the fourth exit, on the
first floor, was open during the
alert. Leading onto Bremner Road,
in front of the Albert Hall, this exit
consists of a 'push-bar' inner door
and a magnetically locked outer
door. Mr Bilby said 'no-one is sure
whether it opened or not. I probably
think that it did'.
Customers have also complained
about the slippery nature of the
floor of the Union lobby in front of
the central doors, and of the stairs
from the lobby to the first floor.
Some students told Felix that people
slipped and fell to the floor during
the evacuation, and that a fight
developed in the lobby. Felix has
also been told that some fire
extinguishers were not working,
and that stewards did not appear to
have adequate fire training. Some
students have also commented on
the possibility of windows in the
Ents Lounge and Da Vinci's Bar
being modified to become fire exits.
