Feeding the Homeless
We deliver food, tea and soup to
homeless people at Lincoln's Inn
Fields, a park in central London.
It is a startling experience. About
one hundred people currently live
in or near to the park. Homes vary
from big plastic bags to carefully
made wooden huts with a (nearly)
waterproof roof, blankets
partitioning bedrooms and crates for
furniture. Some people have lived
there for years.
Owners of a row of tents wanted
to give it a name; 'Tennis Court
Avenue', then they would have a
postal address to write on job
applications. Another group was
busy recycling copper from scrap
cables.
There is a rumour that a
Department of Environment 'task
force' will find real houses for the
residents and clean out the park.
There was a similar rumour last
year.
Everyone who still lives at
Lincoln's Inn Fields prefers it to
hostels and dormitories. There are
misfits and outcasts, people who
cannot live with rules and
regulations. There are some who
proudly call this place 'home'.
We don't wave our magic wand
and solve everyone's problems. We
give immediate relief. We meet at
Week's Hall at 9.00pm every
Thursday, and return to Southside
around closing time. Please come
and help us to help them.

What you do and why you do it
Being at university, we see all
around us lots of different people
doing lots of different things. Some
have their heads down, working all
hours of the day. Others are the
opposite, partying every night.
Others still spend time doing sports
and making their bodies beautiful.
And others still, are active in
'changing the world' type
organisations. And then there's
your average student who perhaps
does a mix of all these things.
Have you noticed some common
link between all these people as to
why they do what they do?
Everyone is trying to achieve
happiness, satisfaction and
contentment. Whether it be the
intellectual challenge of a really
tough problem sheet, or having a
good laugh with the lads at the bar
or the satisfaction of doing
something with one's life by
campaigning against world poverty;
they're all done for the same
reasons—essentially to feel good
within oneself.
Life is all about that. Whether we
do an action or not depends on its
definite or probable outcome. The
more beneficial the likley outcome,
the more we are likely to sacrifice
in order to achieve it. After all that's
mainly why most of us are here
spending years on our various
courses. We hope to get a decent
job and serve humanity, and thus
live as happy a life as possible. It's
natural to want to be happy and
contented and avoid misery and
dissatisfaction.
If some benevolent, trustworthy
sort said to you, 'hop on your left
leg for one minute, and I'll give you
a million pounds', the chances are
that you'd do it. If he said the same,
promising to give you that million
pounds next year, you'd still
possibly do it. Looking silly for a
minute would, in this case, be worth
it.
Now, if some raving maniac was
to point a gun at you and said 'jump
or I'll blow your head off, you
would definitely do as he says. If
he were to say the same, except he
promised to kill you next year, you
would still do as he said, if you
thought that he could definitely find
you in a year's time.
Now consider this. If someone
(who you knew was capable of
absolutely anything) said to you,
'Do this and that for seventy years
and then I'll give you all that you
can ever think of wanting', would
you not do as he says? Forget the
million pounds and think of this
possible reward. Now if that same
person was to say, 'Live a different
way of life for seventy years and I'll
make you burn in fire forever',
would you then not agree to what
he says? Forget the gun and think
of this possible outcome.
But the thing is, that someone is
telling us this. That is, the
Creator—the one who created me,
you, the tree, the sun and
everything else in existence. And
this Creator is more than capable of
fulfilling his promises. The least
reward for living as he asks us to
do, is anything we like—and then
more on top of that—i.e. we can't
imagine the reward. And the least
punishment he promises for living
differently is fire at our feet that will
make our brains boil.
But hang on! Where is all this
coming from? All this comes from
a book that claims to be the word
of the Creator. But this book has no
merit if there's no Creator in the
first place.
As muslims, we invite anyone to
discuss with us our claims that there
is a Creator and that the Quran is
the Creator's authentic word.
Today is the final day of Imperial
College's Islamic Society's Islamic
Week. The topic is Judgement Day.
I spent the first few paragraphs
discussing why people try to do
what they do. This final talk aims
to explain why muslims try to
follow the lifestyle prescribed by
the Creator. We invite you to come
and find out about this reality of
Judgement Day. Then afterwards
you can discuss the issues of
whether the Quran and the existence
of the Creator is true. After all, if
these aren't true, then everything
else, be it Judgement Day, Paradise
or Fire, are nothing more than
fairytales, myths or superstitions.
Come and find out about these,
the most important of issues. You
may think that the chances of all this
being true, is small—but you have
to admit that the stakes are high.
Don't let ignorance strip you
from doing the right thing.
'You denied My Revelations'
although you knew nothing of them.
What was it that you were doing ?'
