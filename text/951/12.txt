Another year, another crown to
defend. This time, the 4th Annual
Pro-Sport Student Trophy
somewhere in the depths of Surrey.
Saturday November 7th saw a mere
fourteen bleary-eyed and yet full-
trousered attempt to repel efforts by
other universities to wrest from us
the title of National Student
Champions. Never one to be
accused of being prima donnas,
Imperial were the only ones to bring
their own camera crew, as the
opposition promised to be both
numerous and challenging and
Imperial were ready to capture this
particular moment of glory on Sony
U-Matic tape.
That morning saw us relatively
underwhelmed by the sheer number
of universities which turned up. All
of three universities—ourselves,
Reading University and De
Montfort University (aka Leicester
Poly) had bothered to attend,
though such academic heavyweights
(check the Times' league table,
bozos) as Kingston Poly (sorry,
University), King's College
London, L S E and the London
School of Pharmacy had promised
to be there.
We were still potentially in for a
rough ride, as Reading were out in
full force and armed to the teeth. All
fifteen of their team had their own
guns, and many played for semi-
Tonight, Imperial College
Symphony Orchestra will give its
first concert of the year in Great
Hall. The orchestra, which went on
an exchange tour of Hungary in the
summer, will be performing with
Laurie Blake in Elgar's 'Cello
Concerto. The programme will also
include Elgar's 'In the South'
Takraw
The game of takraw is a traditional
game played in the countries in
South East Asia. This game is a
mixture of football, volleyball and
badminton all mixed into one. The
game is played on a court similar
to that of badminton, i.e. the height
of the net is the same and the play
area is similar. This is a game for
everyone with the professionals
doing all kinds of incredible, body-
bending moves.
Two teams of three people play
the game. The teams stand on
opposite sides of the net. The
objective of the game is to keep the
professional teams. Despite this, it
wasn't ever going to be an occasion
for a change of underwear. Imperial
has its fair share of semi-
professionals, including Warren 'do
I really look like a girl?' Hirst, Leo
'my hair's just fine this way' Hume-
Wright, and Brendan 'I'll be out
from under the bed in a minute,
honey-bun' Walker.
Imperial's first game of the
morning was a tentative draw
against Reading. Many onlookers
suspect it might have been a little
more active had both teams actually
women up, but it promised more in
the way of sheer talent. This was
ably demonstrated in the crushing
defeat inflicted on De Montfort.
Imperial, short of a couple of
players (in the base camp adjusting
their make-up), eliminated their
opponents in slightly less time than
this correspondent would spend in
the little room in the morning. Hero
of the minute was Ian 'this is going
to look good on my cv' Swaine,
grabbing the flag, tagging several
opponents and stifling a yawn all in
one movement.
This put Imperial neck-and-neck
against Reading, as they put away
De Montfort in pretty much the
same style. The play-off for the top
spot was therefore going to be the
final round match against Reading.
Much to our surprise, it looked like

£4 for adults.
ball in the air. All parts of the body
can be utilised to do this except the
hands. One side must pass the ball
over to the other side within three

there is ho restriction such as that

consecutively.

Boon.
Reading had just used up all their
talent points, as the match turned
out to be a race for the flag between
the Imperial players. Nick 'forget
the gun, have you seen this beauty?'
Stevens and Doug 'my other one's
called Merlin' Burke obliterated the
centre of Reading's line, allowing
the right flank to push up for the
flag, narrowly beating the left flank
to it. All this, despite Brett 'is this
an exit wound?' Iverson starting on
the right, moving to the left and
then back again, creating a new
This week, FilmSoc proudly
present what was undoubtedly the
most controversial film of 1992,
Basic Instinct.
The film, starring Michael
Douglas and the stunning sharon
Stone, begins with a brutal murder
during a steamy sex session; the
murder weapon, an ice-pick.
Michael Douglas is the investigating
detective, and his main suspect, the
victim's ex-girlfriend, is played by
Sharon Stone. The plot thickens
when Douglas discovers that she
has just written a book, a thriller in
which a man is killed by his lover
with, you guessed it, an ice pick—is
this the perfect alibi, or proof of her
guilt.
An animal attraction develops
between Douglas and Stone, as they
play an ever more dangerous cat
and mouse game. He also learns
more about another side of Stone's
life, which includes drugs and an
intense lesbian relationship.
dance move all by himself.
And so the title was retained.
Disappointing turnout by the other
universities, but nevertheless an
opportunity for some of the younger
players to experience some
tournament play. Special mention
and Blue Peter badges to Mike Kim
and Rob Kensey, who now know all
about frying pans and fire. Finally,
a big smooch to Ross and Rex from
STOIC, for covering the game.
Stay tuned for paintball on IC-TV.
Despite the hype and protest
which helped make this film the
huge box office hit that it was,
Stone's bisexuality is largely an
irrelevant aspect of her character.
What was much forgotten about
Basic Instinct while both critics and
censors were up in arms about the
explicit sex scenes, was the brilliant
and unpredictable plot. You really
are kept guessing right until the
bitter end.
For the ultimate, suspense
thriller, with as much action as you
can handle, and some of the most
explicit sex scenes ever to be
released from Hollywood, come
along to Mech Eng 220, on
Thursday 10th December, at
7.30pm. Entrance is 90p for
members, £1.90 for non-members
and the ideal Christmas present for
yourself or your loved ones:
membership for a very reasonable
£6.50, which includes your first
film free.
