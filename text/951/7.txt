Over the years T h e D a i l y
Telegraph has offered a
popular platform for scientists who
wish to communicate their findings
to a broad c o m m u n i t y of people who
take an active interest in science and
technology.
Fet the British public at
large tend to regard
scientists as poor
communicators. T h e Daily
Telegraph Y o u n g Science
Writer Awards 1993 offers
an opportunity to bridge the
divide: write an article
which informs and
entertains the public, and
the winners will have their
articles published on the
M o n d a y science page of Britain's
most popular quality daily
newspaper.
