Fascist concert bid
by Gareth Light
A right wing Student group
threatened to physically prevent a
conceit by German rapper 'J' from
taking place last friday at
Goldsmiths college in South
London.
At 1pm, college officials reported
taking a call from a man claiming
that he represented 'The Nation
Union of Fascist Students', and
threatened to firebomb the concert
- although there are conflicting
reports on this aspect. It is certain
however, that other physical threats
were made, and J's representatives
- having been informed of these -
offered to cancel the show.
In spite of all the drama, the
concert went ahead as planned
without any trouble. This is
possibly due to the 'substantial'
Police security that arrived when
news of potential violence reached
them, but it is believed more likely
that the embryonic Nazi element
failed to arrive.

Humanities Department of Imperial

Doctor debt
by Felix reporters
The health of medical students is
suffering and their studies are being
jeopardised because of high levels
of debt. A survey of more than 300
medical students at Bristol
University showed that one in five
fifth year medics have debts of over
£5,000. The survey has prompted
the Scottish British Medical
Association (BMA) to seek ways of
relieving debt related stress in
medical students.
The Scottish B M A has
approached the Clydesdale Bank
about the possibility of setting up a
debt counselling service. A
spokeswoman for the B M A in
Scotland said 'the matter of student
debt is sufficiently serious to have
deans of medical schools ask us
about counselling newly qualified
doctors'. Nick Steele, chairman of
the B M A Medical Students' group,
said he hoped a Scottish pilot
scheme would be extended to other
parts of the United Kingdom.
'Medical graduates have excellent
prospects of repaying their debts,'
he said.
The move follows the negotiation
of a £10,000 loan package for
students enroling on Nottingham
Trent University's Law Society
final examinations. The Royal Bank
of Scotland has agreed to lend up
to £500,000 to students on the legal
practice course, to be repayed up to
five or seven years after
qualification. Interest is to be
charged at preferential rates.
Warwick Boar Censure Threat
The Warwick University Students
Union is set to wrap the knuckles
of its own student newspaper this
week. The move follows allegations
in last weeks issue of the Warwick
Boar concerning the use of election
funds in sabbatical elections and
unethical practice by the personal
assistant to a member of the shadow
cabinet.
The Warwick Boar is now facing
a motion of censure at today's
Union General Meeting. Union
sabbatical officers, elected on a
Labour Party 'slate', have
condemned 'unethical practice' at
the newspaper, and the Union
treasurer is reported to have
threatened to cut the paper's budget
after the publication of the story. A
'Boar' editorial says that the affair
is 'the tip of the iceberg', and has
accused Labour sabbatical
candidates of irregular election
procedures.
Mr Bob Wilkinson, Personal
Assistant to Labour treasury
spokeswoman, Harriet Harman, is
reported to have used computer
equipment at the University of
Warwick for private constituency
work. Personal details of a
Peckham constituent were found on
a computer disk at the University
Students' Union. The contents of
the disk, which is used in the
Union's general office, were
uncovered by students working for
the Warwick Boar. The letter was
printed on the front page of last
weeks Boar with the name and
address of the constituent blanked
out.
The General Secretary of
Warwick University Students'
Union, Mr Adam Lemon, said that
Mrs Harman faxed constituency
material to Mr Wilkinson, while he
was spending the weekend at
Warwick. The material included the
case details of a man facing
deportation from Britain. M r
Lemon said that Mrs Harman had
asked for the letter to be written
'pretty quickly'. Emma Keeling, a
student on the 'Warwick Boar', said
that seven pages of constituency
related documents had been found
on the disk. She added that these
included a press release, an address
directory, surgery notes, and the
letter which was published by the
Boar.
Mr Lemon claimed that the story
was designed to discredit Labour
candidates standing in Union
elections next spring, and said
'there is no question of a misuse of
funds'. He added that Mr Wilkinson
paid for the use of union equipment,
but Mr Lemon could not recall how
much was paid, or when the
payment was made.
