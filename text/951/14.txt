Amy Grant—Home for
Christmas
Oh, joy to you and everlasting! 'tis
the season to be glittery, cheery and
slightly ruddy-nosed, while you sit
round the fire with your brandy
snaps, singing carols, and sparing
a guilty thought for those poor folk
whose Christmas dinner constitutes
a cup of water and a roast slug that's
been reheated. Yo ho fuckin' ho.
Amy Grant turns her artistic bent
to Bing Crosby territory, swallows
an extra half pound of syrup for
good measure, and starts singing
about children like the sicko
paedophilic mercenary bitch she
really is.
Maybe I'm being a bit harsh.
After all, it is Christmas, and this
deserves to be bought by the
bucketload, because, and this is the
truth of it, you all fucking love this
shit. None of you can justify liking
Christmas, so none of you say you
do, but all you want is to be kids
again. 'Do you remember me, I sat
upon your knee, I wrote to you with
childhood fantasies'. Bollocks. I've
had enough. I'm going home to me
mince pies and me glass of sweet
sherry, and me 'Andy Williams
sings the Little Drummer Boy, and
other faves'. Hum - fuckin' - bug.

Paradise Lost, Cerebral
Fix—Marquee 28.11.92
Cerebral Fix are brilliant. Why
does no one like them? The new
songs sound like their best yet,
although I haven't heard the album.
I shall buy it soon. I've seen this
band blow Obituary away on this
very stage; why aren't they
headlining?
Paradise Lost have no need to
worry about being upstaged by any
support band. Their brand of
Death/Doom or whatever you want
to call it is more than a cut above
most of the genre. The thing is, you
can hear the words—well some of
them anyway—accentuating rather
than detracting from the band's
extreme heaviness. Paradise Lost
are very popular at the moment and
I can easily imagine them becoming
much more than just the darlings of
the underground.
But what a bill—two Death Metal
(ish) bands who have their act on
good songs rather than obscene
artwork and satinic/anatomical
lyrics. A fine display of this type of
music at its best.

The Smiths—Best...11
When I was a nonchalant fourteen
year-old way back, ooh, you don't
want to know when, I loved the
'Joke, the Sisters, the Banshees, and
the Joy Div. Proper Goth stuff, yer
know, not any of yer lily-livered
Rosetta Stone, Bauhaus and yer
Cure... But, lest I forget the point
of this prickly scribbling, I still
remember wondering when, upon
first sight of La Mozzer & Co., why
he felt compelled to whine so
sorrowfully. That was the great
'What difference does it make?', a
superb comic-rock codpiece with a
megalithic chunk of bunched-
knuckle riffola. The shame of it is,
is that this particular record boasts
neither this, or any other of my
hugeous Smithy-type love-
hummers.
So this bag o' luvvlies is much
Gerry Rafferty—I Could Be
Wrong
Oh come on, people, do you really
need to be told which seventies'
classic on the B-side? Well, here's
a quick quiz. Is it a) 'Ding Dang
Dong' by Teaching, 1975
Eurovision song contest winner, b)
'Rock On' by David Essex, winner
of the 1979 Oscar for Worst haircut
for a supporting actor or c) 'Baker
Street' by Gerry Rafferty, million
seller from 1978?

less a 'rock-out' extravangza than
its predecessor; it doesn't matter
that much, even though the overall
effect is a little morose and
altogether more maudlin than their
in-yo'-face jokier moments, but the
humour is still evident; 'Ask',
'Nowhere fast' 'Bigmouth...' and
'Reel around the fountain' the
obvious contenders here for
'funniest moment in Smiths'
history', but 'There is a Light...',
'Last night...' 'Heaven knows...'
are still here to indicate what the
Smiths are remembered for, their
peculiarly English re-invention of
Rock Music, their parochial
iconography, and their coy hop-toad
dance between comedy and tragedy.
Sincerely beautiful moments. I
forgive you, Steven. Pass the daffs.

The Sounds of Blackness-
Soul Holidays c/w Joy
Supposedly a new club 'classic', on
paper it looks OK: production by
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and a
Morales reworking of 'Joy',
originally from the 'Mo' Money'
soundtrack, but it's more like the
sound of shite. Heard it all before,
it's fucking bollox. Fuck off.

Kreator, Biohazard—
Marquee 23.11.92
Hardcore energy; metal power.
Biohazard's bludgeoning, anger-
filled music has no time for subtlety
or tact—instead our skulls are
pounded with their fury and our
bodies thrown aside. This band is
a force to be reckoned with—all
tattooed biceps and that unrivalled
Brooklyn aggression. No need to
adopt 'attitude'—this is the real
thing. Excellent music—but not for
Alison Limerick, Alvin
Davis—The Orange
A wet Wednesday night in West
Kensington.
Alvin Davis takes to the stage,
unnoticed. Just the man and his alto
sax. He's edgy and who wouldn't
be. The club is beginning to fill with
more damp clothes and they all need
a drink. No one bats an eye to the
man wearing glasses until he plays.
The reverb on his sax fills the place
as he moves to one side of the stage
and back again. The sweetness of
tone craves ttention, reminiscent of
Mano Dbango or Miles Davis in
later years. Fluid phrasing.
In keeping with the times Moose
joins him to rap over 'Let it Blow',
the title track from Alvin's new
album. Again Miles is revered,
sampled on tape, studies on stage.
He's warmly received and my socks
are beginning to dry.
If Alison Limerick had a tag on
her sleeve it would read 'I am the
British soul diva, one and only';
who would argue? To even attempt
to describe the qualities of her voice
in words would be a gross injustice,
the weak.
As for Kreator—well they were
too loud for me to hear properly,
and with music this intense clarity
is of utmost importance. I'm
impressed enough to go out and buy
some albums but I'll, reserve
judgement on their live show until
next time.

comparisons with the majority of
other voices criminal. I want to
make analogies between a piece of
MFI tat and a fine mahogany
sideboard, one crafted, nurtured,
hidden depths and beauty, the other
synthetic, mass produced. Fear of
cliche of the week prevents me.
The Orange is in many ways the
Ronnie Scotts of south west
London. Tables too close to the
stage, dance floor virtually non-
existent. Have you ever seen
anyone dance in Ronnie Scotts?
Sometimes you just have to. Songs
like 'Getting it Right', Make it on
my own'. Licenses to lose all
inhibition. No matter the quality of
recorded material available, some
voices cannot simply be heard, they
must be experienced. 'Hear my
call,' 'It's magic'. Such
experiences.
