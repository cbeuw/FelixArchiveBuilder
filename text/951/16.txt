Death Becomes Her
Imagine Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis
and Goldie Hawn as you've never
seen them before, now imagine
Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis and
Goldie Hawn as you've N E V E R
seen them before. Cue twilight zone
theme, do do do do, do do do do,
... okay you try writing it down,
alright just think shock-horror-
deep-breaths, and you'll be on the
right track. This film is weird with
a capital strange, not quite in the
Twin Peaks league but defy
category, it does.
Produced by Robert—Back to the
Future—Zemckis this black (?)
comedy (??) blends that too-often-
dusted-down contemporary tale of
lust, envy, murder and the search
for everlasting youth, with some
boxer-short wettingly good acting,
and some absolutely pant-soilingly
spiffing special effects. Well,
The Frieze of Life—Edvard
Munch—National Gallery
Edvard Munch (1863-1944) is
Norway's- most celebrated artist.
This major exhibition, first staged
in Berlin in 1893, consists of three
major themes: 'love', 'anxiety' and
'death'. A fourth, 'The Green
Room' was added later.
Even if strictly a rainy day gallery
visitor, you've probably
encountered Munch's work, albiet
unconciously. For instance London
Underground pay homage to 'The
Scream' in their current fare
evasion campaign. A man sit's
rigid, his reflection, one of pure
terror. Munch had more than the
transport police in mind though,
'The Scream' famously depicts 'a
scream passing through nature...I
painted this picture, painted the sky
as actual blood. The colour
shrieked.'
If you have ever caught your own
reflection on the tube window
opposite, subtly refracted and
drained of colour, suddenly
appearing that of a lonely stranger,
Munch's work is like that, peopled
by faces simple, strong and thus
more powerful, landscapes
rendered in form rather than
distracting detail.
'Death Becomes Her.
The first series begins with love's
dreamlike conception, moving
through its consumation to the
despair and betrayal Munch sees as
the inevitable ending. The two
connected, indistinguishable loves
of 'The Kiss' contrast with 'The
Vampire', where woman is
portrayed as predator, 'a parasite on
spiritual existence'.
Such happy thoughts are quickly
forgotten as we enter 'Anxiety'.
Faces have become taut white
masks, the world a mad curtain of
swirling blues and reds. Alienation
and death loom large—'pale
corpses.. .a twisted road—at the end
of which was the grave'.
'Puberty' showed his sister
Sophie naked and scared, in the
'Death' room she's faded, serene
and doomed at fifteen to die. In
'The Dead Mother and Child' she
glares out, echoing "The Scream' as
her mother lies still behind.
Pointing 'The Green Room'
Munch was recovering from total
nervous collapse. The lunatic spirit
lingers on through in these savage
scenes set in a claustrophobic
German brothel. So, a madman, but
the strength of this exhibition is:
however hard we try to distract
ourselves we'll all follow this cycle
of love and loss, conception and
degredation. Give it a try but avoid
taking the tube home.

Concert
Yuri Bashmet—Viola
From Brahms to Britten, Marais to
Faure, Yuri Bashmet is the
consumate musician—a magician.
Beginning with Marais' suit in D-
minor, Bashmet eased a viol-like
spareness of tone and dynamic
range from his fiendishly difficult
instrument, highlighting its fugal,
baroque simplicity. Next, the lyric
warmth and energy of Brahms'
sonatas Op 120 Nos. 1 and 2,
another result of the composer's
love of the alto voice, came fully
alive with every caress of the bow.
He coaxes a raw, breathy cello tone
in comptemplative adagio passages
contrasting with the sprighdy agility
and soaring beauty of a violin in
Allegro sections. Accompanist
Mikhail Mantial, struggling with
the sledge-hammer dynamic
subtlety of the incumbent Steinway
was the only flaw here.
It seemed as though all
possibilities of timbre, ingenuity
and tonal beauty had been
exhausted; then came Britten's
Lachrymae. Bashmet racked sighs
and sobs from his viola in a
heavenly lament. To describe his
encore, a Faure, would be 'like
taking a spade to a souffl6...'

should that be 'make me fat, old,
sexy'. It starts too slowly, has a
great ending, and has no middle-
just like Goldie Hawn.
A good film, not excellent, most
certainly not crap, above middling,
ummm, errr, see what you think.
Oh, and keep an eye out for Elvis.

Sibelius, Symphonies
3 and 1
In the opening concert of their
complete symphony cycle at the
Barbican, it was the least Sibelius-
like part of the programme which'
drew the best from Sir Colin Davis
and the LSO. The finale of the First
Symphony is pure Tchaikovsky,
and can sometimes sound
unconvincing, but here it emerged
glossy and powerful as a
thoroughbred racehorse. In
contrast, the tone-poem Luonnatar
of 14 years later shows Sibelius at
the height of his powers; it too
received a dramatic, full-blooded
performance, with Karita Mattila a
wholehearted soloist.
Davis's approach was less
successful in the outer movements
of the Third Symphony. Altogether
a more lithe and sinuous work than
the First, it makes its impact not
through the strength of its
fortissimos but through a build-up
of inner tension which requires
clean, open textures to make itself
fully felt. If I dare to suggest that
this could have been better achieved
by reducing the number of strings,
and being less ready to allow the
LSO brass to have their head to a
sometimes unnerving extent. In the
central slow movement though, one
could not have wished for more
beautiful playing.
