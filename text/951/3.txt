Religion
Religion is the politics of insecurity.
We doubt, religion answers, we
waver, religion is firm, we are
insecure and religion is solidity.
Posters and information which
shock personal insecurities are put
out by religious groups, to attract
us to the church, and satisfy our
unanswered questions. How then
:an a religion be anything else but
fatally flawed? If membership of
iny religion is brought about by a
jress gang of our own doubts how
;an it answer the questions we beg
answers for?
This week was Islamic Week. It
released propaganda as described
above, and played merry hell with
the emotions of anyone who was not
a Muslim. I have no personal
disagreement with Islam, because
every religion on the planet
performs exactly the same tricks.
Religions are built on insecurity
and nurture neurosis. How have
they survived for so long? Easy.
How many wars, murders, and
revolutions, have been caused by
groups of believers? Sikhs,
Muslims, Hindu, Protestants,
Catholics, Jews and even Buddists,
all have been at each others' throats
since the dawn of time.
What is most amazing is that, in
a science college, doubts are still
regarded by students • as
unacceptable. Surely we welcome
doubt. It allows us to question the
world and its workings without the
prejudices of religion. How long
will it take to release ourselves from
bigotry? We should see religion as
it really is; a waste of time, and a
grabber of money. If anyone doubts
this, they need look no further than
the U S A and the evangelistic
preachers on prime time-television.
IC Radio
IC Radio are applying for an F M
broadcasting licence, to use in
Freshers' Week next year. This has
Felix 951
been granted to other student radio
stations in the past, and there is a
reasonable chance of them getting
it. The licence is granted by the
Radio Authority, and approval
would be more likely if senior
members of College were to 'put in
a good word'. If any persuasion was
needed; a serious student radio
station would attract students to
study in central London. Is
anyone out there listening?
Christmas Special
Next Friday as you rush into college
to get your fresh copy of Felix, you
may well be disappointed. Felix
will not appear until Wednesday
16th December. But it will be an
extra-large, bumper-packed, super-
special festive issue. If the Union
does not burn down with Felix staff
unable to get out of the fire doors
(whiff of crisp turkey), you should
have two supplements to take home
and impress your friends, relatives
and budgie. Please be patient, even
4 December 1992
though I know it will be hard to go
without your regular fix of Felix
next Friday.

This has been another spectacular
edition of Felix. The Felix staff
would like to wish good luck to
Dom as he tries to come up with a
new catchphrase over the Christmas
holidays. Kick off those canary
yellow sweatshirts and bring back
the rubine.
Cat's Eyes
Near Miss
The IRA attempted to savagely
blow up the Dominion theatre last
Tuesday where the Prince and
Princess of Wales were to attend the
Royal Variety Performance in a few
days time, but failed miserably due
to three small errors: The first is
that Scotland Yard received a coded
warning, (obviously not that well
coded); the second is that a
mysterious figure was seen on the
roof of the theatre, allegedly
planning a second bomb (probably
that millionaire Texan, Steve whats-
his-name, plotting his revenge
against Princess Di for not leaving
her husband); and thirdly,
according to some reports, they
forgot to prime the bomb (cue mass
hysterical laughter).
Their target was meant as a
gesture of defiance following
revelations that they had planned to
assassinate the couple nine years
ago at the same venue, but thanks
to an accomplice turned informer,
allegedly, the police were tipped
off, (and I thought back-stabbing
only occurred within the House of
Commons).
But Tuesday nights lucky escape
was the third in a row for London.
How many lucky escapes can we
have before our luck runs out?
Aids
I am sick of having the safe sex
message being thrust down my
throat every time there is yet
another AIDS awareness week.
Along with all the mountain of
bumph that is suddenly available,
there are always a multitude of
documentary- type programmes that
appear on T V about people who
have the HIV virus and are at some
stage on the road to a painful death.
Nearly all of these programmes
however are about your average,
ordinary heterosexual who has
contracted the virus by blatant
stupidity. What about the drug users
and homosexuals? T V has
apparently ignored these members
of the public, again showing signs
of prejudice to these people as if it
is them that heterosexuals should
blame for the spread of AIDS.
If T V is an unbiased medium then
I must be watching the wrong
programmes since all these AIDS-
umentarys are total bollocks as far
as fairness is concerned.

Are Y O U so wise that you can put
a price on people's safety?
Obviously we have been blessed
this year with some of the most
fantastic sabbaticals since Einstein
because this is exactly what they are
doing. Time after time they have
been warned that Union Security is
not what it should be and the only
response to calls for more Stewards
or better equipment is "we can't
afford it". It also seems that last
year's Deputy President, Ye Olde
lohnny Griffiths (32), trained
Tricky-Ricky-Bilby very well. In
fact Rick seems to be doing exactly
what Jonathan did last year—as far
as security goes, absolutely nothing.
Let's take a look at last Friday
night. Six hundred or more people
in the Union Building, one fire
door. Now, while fire alarm
systems may be the domain of
college management and not the
union, did it not occur to those who
we voted to power last February to
substantiate the claim that the East
and West fire doors would
magically release themselves in the
event of an emergency? And what
form of telepathy are patrons of the
union bar expected to exercise when
the alarms sound everywhere but in
that infamous drinking hole? Yes,
while being almost inaudible in Da
Vinci's, the alarm did not even
sound in the other bar. Oh, and let's
not forget the disco. Friday night
boppers probably thought the bells
were part of the sound effects—
once again, IF they heard them. We
were lucky on Friday night. It could
have been the 'major incident' that
some have been prophesying. And
then what mess would the licensees
have been in? I believe there are
laws governing the provision of
'steward' type staff at events—are
these laws being met?
We might not like the high and
mighty attitude of some of the
stewards but when you think about
it in the cold light of day, they have
a very difficult job coping with 600
students under the influence. They
have a lot of experience, and from
what I can see most display above
average levels of common sense,
responsibility and professionalism.
So why are they not being listened
to? Virtually every Friday night
there is 'an incident', ranging from
verbal assaults on union staff to full
scale evacuations. A year ago there
was a vast change in union security
when card checking was introduced
and the then duty officers started
working in groups on Wednesday
and Friday nights using age old
radios to stay in touch (this after a
duty officer was assaulted). Now it
is time for another such vast
change. However, since the
beginning of term (when, it seems,
an external source made a detailed
report on the faults with union
security) nothing has changed. A
person who was only last year a
student, who has no experience or
knowledge in the field of
organisational security, and whose
money control policy is simple
(don't spend any), is responsible for
your safety. C O U L D Y O U LIVE
WITH YOURSELF IF SOMEONE
GOT SERIOUSLY INJURED IN
T H E UNION, RICK?
