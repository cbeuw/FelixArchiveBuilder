That's Entertainment
This Friday sees the great Club
Atmosphere rear its ugly head from
the more of tedium that is the day-
to-day life at Imperial College.
Swing your pants and fling your
body to the soul funk fusion indie
poppy dance progressive house 70s
retro, techno-tribal, shamanic,
archaic revival. The evening kicks
off with the Smile Zone, 20% off
all drinks at the bar from 8.30pm
till 10pm then a bar till lam. The
now legendary Ents disco will be
kicking it loud from 8pm till 2am.
Entrance to this fun-filled
extravaganza is a whole pound
(proceeds to Nursery Benefit).
This is quickly followed the week
after (11th December) by a festival
of hypnotism and mysticism
featuring the all time great, Geno
Washington. This American soul
crooner is also one of the country's
top hypnotists. Sing like M J and
Prince and other very embarrassing
antics. Tickets available now, see
posters for details.
But no!! The fun just never stops
here in Ents land. The last night of
term, 18th December, is kits off and
eyes down for a full house, the
house of Dr Death Bang!! Along
with these officionados of funk soul
dance, that are Death Bang Party
(back by public demand) will be
Pussies Galore. Tickets for this
most prestigious of all Ents events
are very limited and are available
from the Union Office now!! Get
your tickets now to avoid
disappointment.

The Official Version
At the 'Atmosphere' event in the
Union building last Friday, the fire
alartn was set off at around lam
when a 'break glass' switch was
tampered with. Evacuation of the
building was initially prevented at
the east staircase exit as the
magnetically locked doors into the
Quad failed to open automatically.
Union Stewards immediately called
the Beit Quad security guards who
opened the door manually enabling
evacuation to be completed, though
in a longer time than I would
consider satisfactory with regard to
the safety of those in the building.
Obviously, in the event of a real
fire, such a delay could have
extremely serious consequences.
The malfunction was due to a fault
at the interface between the existing
fire alarm system, and the
'maglock' system which was
installed over the summer vacation.
This fault has now been rectified,
and we have arranged for a special
weekly test of the entire Union
building alarm system, to take place
before the 'Atmosphere' event each
Friday. The only time the
'maglock' doors are closed while
the building is in use is during an
event.
A further problem highlighted on
Friday night was the fact that alarm
bells are not audible in some parts
of the Union building, notably the
Traditional Bar when busy. College
fire officers were already aware of
this problem, and had placed an
order for a new power supply unit
designed to boost the power to all
bells and hence make them louder.
Ironically this power supply unit
was delivered last Thursday!
College authorities have taken the
incident very seriously, and rather
than attempting to find a scapegoat
to 'hang from the yard-arm' are
more concerned with bringing the
Union fire alarm system up to
scratch. I have been assured that the
new power supply unit will be
installed as soon as possible.
