Great Sightseeing Challenge
Have you ever tried to leapfrog
around Trafalgar Square? Or carry
a seventeen stone team-mate one
hundred meters down the road and
back in under one minute? Do you
know what piece of surgery Queen
Victoria's statue underwent
recently? If you don't, those that
took part in RAG's GSSC last
Saturday certainly do. Five teams
and a total of forty collectors braved
the freezing cold to shake their cans
and strut their stuff in aid of Shelter,
a charity for homeless people and
those in inadequate housing (no,that
doesn't include Halls of
Residence!). Although the turnout
was a little lower than we'd hoped
for, morale was high and everybody
entered into the spirit of the event.
The challenge, for those of you
who didn't read last week's article,
was to visit nine specified locations
in as short a time as possible,
collecting money and accruing
points by completing physical
challenges, trivia questions and on
the spot scavenges. Extra points
were also available by bribing the
marshals with suitable liquid
Grand Tour
refreshment (I believe coffee was
actually the most requested bribe!).
The locations were all popular
tourist sights, as you may have
guessed by now, and included
places like Sadlers Wells, Covent
Garden and Camden Lock so the
teams got to see all the things they'd
been too busy doing R A G to see
before.
A big thanks to all the marshals,
most of whom stayed out in the cold
for the greater part of the day -
except for brief forays in search of
warmth. Some of them even
managed to collect as well!
Personally, I thought that the
amusement obtained from watching
one team attempt to build a human
pyramid in Parliament Square made
it all worthwhile.
The top team won Shelter
baseball caps and T-shirts and
everyone else that took part also
gets a T-shirt, so if you think that
you are due a prize, come along and
find out at the R A G meeting on
Friday at 1.10pm in the Ents
lounge.
Sixteen European capitals in 132
hours, straight after the end of term
is the impossible dream of three
intrepid IC first years. This unusual
R A G stunt is the brainchild of
Garden Hall, desperate to increase
their total. Our truly international
team comprises one Pole, one
Ozzie, and some guy from north of
Watford. We'll return with a photo
of a human pyramid under the Eiffel
Tower, praying at the Vatican,
stepping off a tram in Vienna,
Halls' News
etc...any request considered,
reasonable or otherwise. If you're
kicking yourself for not thinking of
this before console yourself by
throwing your money at Richard
'vodka' Marchlewski, John
Williamson or Kevin 'northern
twat' Ward, all from Garden Hall.
Be warned, if you haven't been
hassled for sponsorship yet you'll
see us in lectures. Support IC
abroad and R A G .

Rag Raid Revenge
'Oh no' I hear you cry, 'not another
amazing RAGraid!' Yes, that's
right. On Saturday 5th December
(that's tomorrow), Chris Pease, the
Rag raid coordinator, will be taking
a minibus to Aylesbury to collect
for Barnados and he wants you on
it! All bodes well - the weather can't
possibly be as cold as it was for the
Great Sightseeing Challenge, and
Tim Atkinson (the driver), has
promised not to drink anything
alcoholic the night before....! What
more reason do you need? Secure
your place N O W by signing up in
the Rag Orifice, or at the Rag
meeting on Friday.
