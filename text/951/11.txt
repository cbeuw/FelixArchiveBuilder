generation.
T am disappointed to the soles of
my boots that my generation which
promised so much, should have
delivered so little by way of radical
change.. .much of the responsibility
of that conspicuous failure I
attribute to the influence of
feminism and to the perverted
account of personal relations and of
social composition which feminism
has fostered.'
Nowhere does Lyndon address
the paradox of how a movement
with so little support amongst even
women, let alone men, could come
by such a degree of mysterious and
sinister power.
The level of this kind of abusive
attack continues throughout the
book, and if the consistency of his
invective continues to shock, then
the content no longer does. It comes
as no surprise that Lyndon believes
rape to be an event which is 'over-
reported', and instances of child-
abuse to be 'willfully magnified'.
Lyndon discounts the problem of
domestic violence altogether,
arguing that, since the number of
places for women in refuges in the
U K is about 650 (excluding
children) that it seems that women
are obligingly able to arrange their
lives so as not to exceed this
number. He goes on to complain
'What the hell has happened to us
as a generation, as a nation, a
people, that the plight of 650
women should be treated with so
very much more sympathy and
political energy than a million
people who may have to have no
home?'. Quite apart from the fact
that every social injustice is as valid
as the next to those who experience
it, and that to establish a qualitative
hierarchy is an invidious route to
take, this kind of breathtaking
propensity to pirrouhette over
statistics is a disturbing feature of
Lyndon's work.
... breathtaking
propensity to
pirouette over
statistics...
Neil seems to have trouble also
with the idea that women might be
discriminated against in the
workplace. When proposing that
the number of women in Parliament
was not artificially low, he takes a
step out of the quagmire of
statistical analysis, and proceeds
simply to guess values of his own.
'Despite all the evidence to the
contrary, let's assume that male-
prejudice is a genuine obstruction
to women candidates, let's guess
that male prejudice might account
for the absence of fifty MPs, that
still leaves two hundred women
MPs missing from the house.'
The reason, Lydon thoughtfully
informs us is 'Babies'.
I propose a different tack, let's
assume that male prejudice isn't a
genuine obstruction to women
candidates, let's guess that male
prejudice might account for the
absence of precisely zero female
MPs, from a total of around 600
MPs, around 300 should be
most noteworthy feature about these
features was that they were all
written by women, Lydon
unwittingly awoke the sleeping
beauty of the feminist sisterhood,
and they returned an impressive
performance offering extensive
critical review by amongst others
Germaine Greer, Helena Kennedy
QC, Fay Weldon, Yvonne Roberts,
Kate Millet, Angela Lambert,
Nigella Lawson, lulie Birchill,
Beatrice Campbell, and even
Lyndon's estranged wife, Deidre.
Andrew Neil and Melvyn Bragg
conversely, were peculiarly reticent
even in interviewing Lyndon,
neither really questioned Lyndon
inured to the kind of slow anger I
ended up feeling. Lyndon spoke out
for the angry 'new men', and
Roberts addressed herself to the
feminist faithful, and there was
hardly any ground in between.
Lyndon rounded on 'mad
feminists', and Roberts rounded on
Lyndon. Melvyn Bragg had on a
pair of bifocals and sitting directly

opposite me with a disconcertingly
disgusted look on his face,
contrived to look like Paddington's
irate neighbour M r Curry.
Eveybody seemed intellectually
angry about whatever they had
come to be angry about. Lyndon's
primary anguish was that men are
unable to stay in contact with their
children post-divorce or break-up,
don't get custody and are forced by
the courts to pay maintenance. This
is unquestionably anguish which he
himself feels, since he lost contact
with his six-year-old son, after his
marriage broke down, at the time
of writing N M S W . He didn't help
himself though by claiming to know
that many women who say they
have been raped, are actually lying,
and that still many others use
abortion as a cosmetic
contraceptive. Roberts, in going a
way to correct him on these matters,
didn't give any real indication that
his anguish was of much note. For
me, little transpired from the
evening except how utterly and
paralysingly vulnerable people are,
and how short a step it is between
pain and anger. It's nothing at all
to express anger in whatever
manner comes to hand, it's easy and
predictable, and sad.
In 1990 in the Sunday Times,
Neil Lyndon wrote:
'Something ruinous and evil has
happened between men and women
in the last 25 years. Something so
wounding and painful and sore, that
it is hard to see how the last
generations of this century can
come of age, unafflicted by the ills
of the past.'
'Something so wounding and
painful and sore' is not a voice we
can afford to ignore, no matter from
whom it comes. If the sixties
generation which promised so much
in the way of hope, has emerged so
embittered, then, unless we listen
with some sympathy and humanity,
then sadly, we too are doomed.
Neil Lyndon's book provoked a huge outcry, acting as a call to arms for
many a closet feminist sympathiser. Shown above is 'Mad about Women'
by Yvonne Roberts, one of the books produced as a response to No More
Sex War.
women. Currently, there are around
sixty, and they don't all have
babies.
Lyndon uses the cute device of
simply not including an appendix in
his book, to offset queries about the
statistics he has chosen to quote.
It would be easy, and very
tempting, simply to dismiss 'No
More Sex War'. If that were all
there was to say, I should hardly be
wasting my time or yours.
However, when his book was
published, Neil Lydon was
propelled into a furore of publicity,
and was attacked by columnists in
successive features in The Sunday
Times, The Times (who ran five
features on it in the space of a
week), The Daily Telegraph, The
Evening Standard, The Guardian
and The Independent. Lyndon was
interviewed on daytime T V slots,
appeared on Start the Week, with
Melvyn Bragg, was interviewed by
Andrew Neil, Editor of the Sunday
Times, and became the subject of
numerous other fallout articles. The
about his views, or came out either
in support, or against him, prefering
instead to limit the discussion to
Lyndon's reaction to the media
coverage given to ' N M S W ' .
Lyndon said he had been
victimised, and that none of his
arguments had been answered by
any of the 'harridans' who had
reviewed it. Most responses, it
seemed, had comprised in part of
asking him if he had a 'problem'
with women. It would have been
tempting to say, 'Well Neil, what
did you expect?', but none of the
boys did. The Times and Dillons
organised a debate, 'Has Feminism
Failed?', to promote the book.
More than 900 people paid Â£ 1 0 to
attend.
Neil Lyndon and professor
Kenneth Minogue (LSE) spoke for
the motion, Yvonne Roberts and
Beatrix Campbell spoke against,
and Melvyn Bragg chaired.

said. Having emerged from a month
