IC firsts, sponsored by 'R Whites',
continued their winning form,
despite the lack of support from
ladies hockey.

Bruce. Apologies for absence come
from Tom Robson, who was in jail.
The defence, eager to attack, had
many shots on goal, culminating in
the long range goal from two yards
by Annan Galloway.
The midfield, sponsored by
Araldite, ran all over the place for
no apparent reason, although Rafael
Martinez scored a hat-trick in the
last game, so that's alright. Also
The Dribblers started well, but team
morale dropped sharply after a foal
from Chrstie in the fourth minute
was disallowed due to a player who
shall remain nameless being offside.
Captain Eleanor was once again
absent, does she know something
we don't? Although at least this
time we had a full team—
eventually. Kings dominated much
of the game, although the Dribblers
did manage to get a few shots on
IC Netball
Imperial College Union Netball
Club may not be the largest of
clubs, but we make up for the lack
of members by excellent results.
We may only be a club consisting
of eight female members, but that
doesn't mean our team is of a low
standard.
I think this year, we have proved
ourselves to not only to be one of
the best female sports teams at IC,
but also we are doing much better
than many of the large male sports
clubs.
After coming second in the first
round of the U A U tournament, after
Reading, we are through to the next
round in January. This achievement
shows that the IC Netball team this
year, has got further and done much
better than the team in previous
years.
In addition to this, we are
currently at the top of our division
in the U L U Netball League and we
hope to set a record for IC here too
in the tournament next year.
The scores recently have included
victories against U C L , Royal
Hospital and London and Royal
Holloway and Bedford: 49-3, 44-12
and 31-26 respectively.
So come on IC, why not give us
a bit more recognition?
Ruben scored in another game.
The second goal was actually the
first, and was John Mottashed's
seventh, who 'is' keenly supported
by ladies hockey.
Other notable incidents in
midfield were Stuart Watson
winning a header, Richie Dixon
passing the ball square, and Tellis
'louganis' Botzios playing in
position.
Although scrappy i.e. made the
game safe with a beautiful corner

IC are now through the U A U , as
the quarter finals of the U L Cup,
and on top of the league, but
unfortunately not on top of ladies
hockey.
goal but the net remained elusive.
Had the Dribblers kept their spirits
up, had the pitch been drier and had
the referee not allowed Kings to
take their foul throws again (?) the
final score may have been very
different.
As usual the Dribblers were
victorious in the boatrace, splitting
into two teams of four and racing
each other as Kings were too weak
and feeble to take part.
Wobblers
We had prepared for the game with
hours of practice. Our short corner
routine was bound to devastate
opposing defences. Like Heinz, but
better, we had 400 variations of
tomato-sauced, goal-mouth
stimulation.
The game started with a single St
Bart's attack followed by 20
minutes of Imperial 'total hockey',
including all the 400 above
flavours. Of course we didn't score
from any of these. At least Dave
Fairhurst managed to stop his slips
this time. As for Steve Lam, he had
enough time to give birth to an
elephant before missing several
times. Thankfully our open play
came to the rescue. Like St George
astride a majestic charger, Steve
redeamed himself with a bumbling
drive over the keeper. Thus spurred
on to higher things we rammed
another three home, courtesy of
John Furlong, Dave F and Steve
(again).
The second half quickly followed
but was a grey affair, livened only
be encores from Dave and John.
The only other event of note was
John's own goal. Determined to
derail Simon the goalie's clean
sheet, he carefully redirected a
wayward shot into our goal.,
After initial confusion - when we
found ourselves without any second
row - and a swift position change
round, IC seconds started a hard,
but enjoyable game in the driving
seat. Most of the possession was
IC's, increasing as the police got
more tired. The first try came from
good dodging and pacey running
from Fly-half Adam Wood.
Unfortunately, the wind was against
us in the first half blowing the kick
back towards us. Rucking and
mauling wasn't as clean as it could
have been, but Mark Ashford and
Tom Upsdell slowed down their
backs well, enabling the back row
to get in position again. The second

Sunday 29th December
After only six weeks of training,
the I.C. Virgins were thrust onto the
pitch for their first game. Despite
inexperience, our girls put up a
superb performance, with the
forwards demonstrating their newly
acquired scrummaging skills. The
'Goldies' few more capable players,
however, quickly took advantage of
our initial weaknesses and scored a
try. Their lack of practice showed
through at their poor attempt at a
conversion, with the ball hardly
leaving the ground. Our player of
the Match, Permi, brought her
football training into practice and,
after a storming sprint up the wing,
scored a try and almost made the
Imperial achieved excellent results
at the British Indoor Rowing
Championships last Sunday. The
9-strong contingent competed on
the Concept II ergometer rowing
machine, which universally forms
the excruciatingly painful basis for
winter land training. Heats and
finals were both rowed over 2,500
metres, times in general reflecting
that this particular event comes in
the middle of endurance, as
opposed to speed, training.
Ed Wild, though disappointed
with his own performance
nevertheless achieved a creditable

play, by neat passing down the line
to Simon Davalle on the wing who
squeezed one in the corner.
The pack stood up well to a large
police side with the usual front row
- Simon, Rich (capt.) and Mark -
pushed by Simon and Karl in the
second row. The flankers, John
Cassidy and John (Break right,

Roebuck, once again had a superb
game. Jumping was consistent
throughout the game and scrums got
better as we didn't get tired. James
Wilson, inside centre, also asked
for a mention.
conversion, missing by mere
inches. The second half saw another
try by the opposition and an injury
on each side, and the shortened
game left our girls wanting more.
I.C. gave a better demonstration
of their abilities in the bar
afterwards, out-drinking and
definitely out-singing Goldsmiths.
Our thanks must go to all the people
who came out to Sidcup to support
us and especially to Leon Orr and
Dave Bolton for their tireless
training. Our next game is on
Sunday 24th January at Harlington.
Supporters welcome.

Green took 6th. John Warnock
shone in the lightweight men's
category, coming 3rd. Anna-Marie
Dryden who rows for Imperial as
part of the national squad produced
the performance of the
championships by shaving 0.1 of a
second off the world record in
winning the lightweight women's
category, also beating all but 3 of
the heavyweight women. Both she
and John Warnock have therefore
booked their places at the World
Championships held in Boston,

Student ergometer championship in
early February.
