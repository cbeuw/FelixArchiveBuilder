Dear Jonty,
I would like to correct some
inaccuracies which appeared in
Felix Issue 949 on 20th November,
Catering Laws affect Imperial
Students.
The College policy on the
provision of food for sale is as
follows:
All food sold on College
premises, or food provided for
private functions in rooms
controlled by the College approved
caterers (including ICU) must be
supplied by College approved
caterers.
Parties using food in low risk
categories eg. crisps, nuts etc, are
exempt and parties for fifty people
or less may be exempt if approved
by the College approved caterers,
depending upon the food items to
be supplied.
In areas not contolled by the
College approved caterers it is the
responsibility of the relevant Head
of Department to ensure that the
food provided complies with the
provisions of the 1990 Food Safety
Act.
Departments must obtain advice
on these matters from David Smith,
Catering Operations Manager.
Senior College figures have not
banned the use of external catering
firms'for any functions held within
College buildings. The College

Dear Editor,
An unfortunate incident took
place in the JCR on 18th November
during the Overseas Week, where
the Turkish Society stand was
attacked by a violent crowd
demanding the removal of a tourist
poster from the display board. As
the poster did not have any political
content and a direct insult to any
group or individual, we, the
Turkish Society members, think
that it was wrong to accept their
demand and remove the poster.
We think that, there must be
• some principles and regulations
ruling the activities of the societies
within the ICU, and every society
should stand up to protect these
principles. By trying to stand up
against those hooligans that day in
the JCR, we think the Turkish
Society has played its role in
protecting these principles. When
the ICU Officers Rick Bilby and
Dominic Wilkinson arrived at the
Turkish Society stall they stated that
they did not find the poster in
question offensive either.
Unfortunately, after having spoken
to that violent crowd Mr Wilkinson
seemed to realise that it was easier
to ask the Turkish Society to
remove the poster than to free the
administration are aware of their
legal responsibilities under the 1990
Food Safety Act, and do not wish
to permit events to take place which
could potentially put at risk the
health of guests attending functions
and at the same time render the
College authorities liable for
prosecution.
The Act specifies the need for
food handlers to be trained, for
hand washing facilities to be
available, and for strict adherence
and monitoring of temperature
controls of food in transportation,
storage and display.
The concern to College is where
hosts of events for large numbers
produce food at home, where there
is inadequate refridgeration for that
amount, transport it in to College,
without proper chilling and heating
facilities, hold it in College in an
inappropriate environment and then
offer it for sale.
Societies wishing to host events
are welcome to use College catering
or, if using an external supplier,
must comply with a checklist of
requirements and give six weeks
notice.
Details are available from the
Union Manager, Mandy Hurford,
and Catering Operations Manager,
David Smith.
Yours sincerely,
Simon Westerman.
room from that aggressive group of
people to maintain order in the JCR.
From that point, we think the
Turkish Society and the Overseas
Students Committee (OSC) have a
right to demand an apology from
the ICU for not being strong enough
to maintain a peaceful atmosphere
in the JCR for the Overseas
Societies to carry on with their
activities within the Overseas
Week. That apology should also be
demanded from the ICU for trying
to impose on an Overseas Students
Society the decision of a group of
hooligans on which posters can or
cannot be displayed.
We also think that every student
in this college should be able to
display a poster from his/her home
town regardless of whether or not
his/her country has been recognised
by the United Nations. And we
think that he/she should be able to
do this within a society that he/she
feels comfortable with.
We also strongly believe that the
whole body of OSC should act in
harmony by condemning the action
of the crowd of hooligans in the
JCR on 18th November, resulting
in the closure of the JCR.
On behalf of the Turkish Society,
Sener Sezgin.

Dear Jonty,
Anonymity is a recurrent whinge
of the Rector. Sir Eric criticises Beit
Back, some letters and the like for
their absence of names. He assures
us that no one need fear expressing
their views in Felix. No one will be
victimised, he tells us.
Why, then, are some students
being disciplined by College

Dear Sir,
In the wake of yesterday's
(Friday 27th) fire alarm in the
Union Building at just after lam,
there are four questions that I would
like to see publicly answered by the
college authorities:
1. Why are the alarm bells so
quiet as to be barely audible above
the hubbub in Da Vinci's, let alone
in the disco?
2. Why did the door between the
Union Bar and Da Vinci's not
unlock automatically to allow
people egress into Beit Quad? (This
door could not be kicked down. I
know because I was one of three
people including a Union Steward
who put a lot of effort into trying
Disciplinary committee for the
expression of their views? Would
they be exempted from this witch
hunt if they wrote same opinions in
Felix, rather than verbally?
It's time he came clean on this
one. Even if he has to write in Felix
to do it.
The usual regards,
Declan Curry.
to break it!!)
3. Why were there no fire engines
in attendance? Can such a heavily
populated building honestly not be
connected directly to the fire
station?
4. How many people are going to
have to die before the college
management sees fit to upgrade this
and other fire alarm system in
college buildings?
I hope that these questions can be
answered in this publication, but I
fear that college management, as is
their wont will ignore this
potentially fatal incident.
Yours faithfully,
C A France, Civ Eng 2.
