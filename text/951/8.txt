Ladies and Gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to present, for your
delectation, the hysterically funny,
the shockingly adolescent
making another taste-free entrance
into British homes, at no particular
offence to your sensibilities and
intellect, I give you, T H E VIZ
V I D E O E X T R A V A G A N Z A ! !
(Cue trumpet fanfare)
When I first saw the comic Viz
way back in 1987, its lip-smacking
humour and fireproof wit seemed to
bring new life to what had
essentially become a haggard and
prematurely flogged format, much
the same as the Young Ones had
revitalised the sitcom idea by taking
the piss out of it. What materialised
were the sort of plots, and the sort
of kids, that gestated around minor
public schools in pre-war Britain,
a hearken back to the days of The
Beano, Just William and all those
pre-pubescent fantasy characters
dreamt up by people who really did
not have cause to patronise
children. Arguably, the same fate
awaited V i z ; Viz's unique
attraction, however, was the
magnificent injection of cartoon
violence and the intelligent
application of 'adult' themes to its
stories and characters, but with the
comic's cornerstones being the
immensely puerile Johnny
Fartpants, Buster Gonad, and
Postman Plod, the honeymoon had
to end. Viz officially ceased to be
funny in January 1989.
Notwithstanding this minor
setback, Viz stuck its tongue in its
cheek even further than before and
stoically refused to accept the
inevitable. Result? The 'comic for
adults' went from strength to
strength, astutely acquiring for itself
a couple of (much) lesser rivals,
whose names escape me in much
the same way as their humour does.
But, to return to our topic. In
December 1990, Channel 4
commissioned from John Brown
Publishing (the organisation behind
Viz) a cartoon featuring Billy the
Fish, a half-man, half-fish character
who played the Goalkeeper in a
bewildering homage to Roy of the
Rovers. Also featured on the team
were Brown Fox, a 'Large-Breasted
Squaw', Johnny X , the obligatory
invisible man, Mick Hucknall from
Simply Red ('he failed to deliver
after a promising start, in a bizarre
parody of his pop career'), and
V I D E O S
'Eeh, San, see that feller? 'E's beggin' fer it'
Shakin' Stevens. With Harry
Enfield doing the voices, 'Billy the
Fish-the Motion Picture' was a
triumph. They followed this with
'Roger Mellie, the Man on the
Telly', a foul-mouthed and
incredibly tactless children's T V
presenter brought to life by Peter
Cook. Again, it made hugely
entertaining, though by no means
compulsive, viewing. It appears that
recent attempts to repeat these
successes with 'Sid the Sexist' and
'The Fat Slags' have been, shall we
say, a little fraught.
The nature of the problem lies
within the material itself. While
'Roger.Mellie' has much content
designed to offend, the concept is
'politically' sound, something
neither Sid or the Slags can claim
to have. Channel 4 declined to show
them; therefore, both have been
marketed through video where they
remain reasonably accessible. A
few weeks ago, Felix was admitted
to a secret location, with a
privileged group, for a very special
screening
The initial feeling among the
group was one of disappointment.
The first witness, who declined to
be named and for the purposes of
this article will be referred to as
'Dom', said he found 'the transfer
from paper to celluloid interesting,
but the wibbly-wobbly bits with the
Fat Slags were not present; they
were no more disgusting than the
rest of the characters, which was the
problem'. 'Sam' disagreed; she
said, T found the Rubber
Panhandlevision brought them to
life superbly', and, when asked
which character he preferred,
'Dom' plumped for Sid, as 'it was
a lot more continuous, with more
funny one-liners'. 'Phil', the
evening's whipping boy, decided
'yes', when the rhetorical question
'is Sid really that extreme when in
the context of Imperial College?
'was asked of no-one in particular.
An embarrassing silence followed,
before he hastily added that there
were no such comparisons with the
Slags. Sid the Sexist, the general
favourite, features the voice of Bob
Mortimer, drinking down the local,
getting chucked out of the disco,
and a holiday in Marbella, where
he and his chums come a cropper
with 'some dago bush'. A cartoon
in the conventional sense, as
opposed to the plasticine Fat Slags,
featuring Waynetta Slob of Harry
Enfield's 'the slobs'. They ate a
great deal of food, drunk a great
deal of beer, and shagged a couple
of taxi drivers, some very drunk,
very little men, one or two of their
prospective employers, and their
dentist, all on the grounds that they
were 'beggin' fer it', or that "e
couldn't keep 'is 'ands off me'. If
there was ever any doubt about the
reality of these characters at all,
believe me. I'm from the North,
and these people are real, but this
is not regional humour. Sandra,
Tracey, Sid, Bob, Barry, and the
funny little one with the weird hair
and a nose like a miniature
elephant's trunk have all got solid
foundations in their characters. Yes,
they're extreme, they're as
offensive as animation could ever
possibly get, they're frequently
hysterical, and the strange thing is,
the animation does them an
injustice.
