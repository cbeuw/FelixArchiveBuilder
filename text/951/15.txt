All About Eve, The Sea
Nymphs —The T&C
The Sea Nymphs were only
describable as...well, strange. They
were a good strange though, as
opposed to a bad strange. We didn't
get too near the stage because a) we
were drinking and b) they looked
quite smelly! Their music was a
gallimaufry of unusual styles, which
you either liked or hated, sort of
like oral sex really.
All About Eve did a poor
impression of the All About Eve we
all know and love. The entire set
comprised of material from their
Beautiful South —Wembley
Arena 24.11.92
So, I'm sat in my impressive front
row seat that Go Discs have kindly
given me, and would you believe it?
Bob Mortimer (of meat product
infamy) sits down right next to me.
This isn't relevant, I just thought I'd
mention it after last week's Debbie
Harry episode. (I also saw Billy
Bragg that day, so ya boo sucks! Ms
Yates).
The Grimthorpe Colliery brass
band came out as support. They
play brilliantly, and go down
surprisingly well with Joe Public
(who is definitely not a Camden
Underworld mosher tonight).
Sadly, their playing well is neither
here not there, as their appearance
is nothing more than a vain political
statement and an extension of The
South's increasingly pretentious
attempts to reach 'right on-ness' at
their predominantly middle-class
audience.
While The Beautiful South are a
good band, they aren't exciting.
Shonen Knife/BMX
Bandits-ULU 26.11.92
When we walked in, the BMX
Bandits were already playing; 'too
studenty' commented my sweet and
charming companion, too right-
but I liked them.
Shonen Knife were fuckin'
marvellous, the band name actually
means youth knife, and whether
they're a conceptual novelty band
or not, I don't care, I luv 'em down
to the ground. They're so
aesthetically naff, you just can't
hate them. Even with corny one
liners like 'we lub U ' are delivered
in such an unassuming,
unprententious manner they create
arches that flex through your entire
system (yes, I'm serious!). 'I A m
A Cat' probably comes from an
acclaimed Jap book by Soseki
Natsume called 'Wagahai wa neko
de aru'—an anthropomorphic satire
seen through feline eyes; it's
basically brilliant. 'Space
Christmas' and 'Bear Up Bison'
went down a treat, and the new
new album (apart from two old
songs which were revamped to
sound like they were from the new
album)! Not to be too bitchy, the
new material is pretty good, but
then again, once you've heard one
song you can put your C D player
on repeat and you're not going to
notice any difference.
There was one thing, however,
that they've kept from their
traditional gigs, and that's sounding
like an almost perfect reproduction
of the album. Nice backdrop and
lightshow though.
Lily, Minnie & Viola.
Among the very 'toe tapping'
singles like 'Pencil Case', 'Red
Eyes' and 'We Are Each Other'.
I'm left looking around the Arena,
and think abut my parasitology
essay. The Housemartins' sound
comes back to lift the proceedings
from time to time, this and some
inspired singing from the now fat
and shaven headed Heaton,
conspire to drag the set out form the
gaping jaws of mediocrity.
Having said that, it was a very
enjoyable gig, not really my scene,
but this being their first 'big'
London venue ever, and technical
problems like the backdrop
plummeting to the ground halfway
through can't have helped them
very much either.
In the end temptation overcame
me, and I asked:
'What did you reckon then Bob?'.
'Smart.' said Bob.
Can't say fairer than that can
you?
Glyph McCord.
psychedelic 'Brown Mushroom'
was absolutely mind blowing. No
Pluto references, but 'Riding the
Rocket' sped past my sense of
reality and balance; in fact the dude,
Poddy can probably empathise with
me too (empathalogicalities—
Poddy).
It's so great to see Jap women
breaking out of the stereotype of the
conformist society and doing their
thing. In fact 'Baggs' on the 'Pretty
Little Baka Guy' is great satire
taking the piss out of most women
in the land of the rising Yen (er,
sorry—sun) who all carry Luis
Vuitton bags thinking they have
class. (Na-h, dream on).
Sheer attitude without pretention,
sheer aesthetics without over-
indulgence. All I can say is I'm in
luurrve.

Unsane, Surgery—Camden
Underworld 24.11.92
Ah, the great injustices of life—
Unsane supporting Surgery, for
example. I mean, come on, anyone
in the know surely knows that
Unsane is the best thing to come out
of New York since the Guardian
Angels (erm...) and don't deserve
to be support to anyone, let alone
Surgery. But hey, life's like that
sometimes, I guess.
Okay, so the Underworld isn't
such a great venue, what with the
pillars all over the place and the
really atrocious sound (which
admittedly did get better) and the
low stage, and considering that this
was Unsane's first gig with new
drummer Vincent Signorelli they
sounded pretty good. I laughed
when they tuned their guitars, tho',
because these guys were L O U D —
feedback howling hither and thither
and they hardly stopped for breath
the whole time so the set was just
noise noise noise, and hey, that's
what us kids want, right? Ear
destroyingly good fun.
Surgery confounded all my pre-
gig expectations totally by being
pretty good as well. I shoulda'
known they'd be okay tho', seeing
as they're on the ultra-hip-and-cool
Amphetamine Reptile record label
(oooops...gratuitous mention of
seminal underground label there,
sorry; God, I'm just so 'with it'
sometimes!).
Uh..that's it.

Robert Palmer—Royal
Albert Hall
What happened to Robert Palmer?
I remember Robert Palmer, as do
most people, for rock classics such
as 'Addicted to Love' and 'Simply
irresistable'. I went to the Royal
Albert Hall on Wednesday evening
expecting to hear those and more of
his many hits.
I was certainly surprised.
Robert Palmer was to be
accompanied by the B B C Radio 2
Orchestra, which was a little
strange but I thought nothing of it.
The orchestra came on and
played something that my gran
would appreciate. Then the man
himself came on. He sang a couple
of songs from the 1920s era. It
became apparent, from what he said
between the songs, that he intended
to carry on this big-band, swing sort
of music for the rest of the concert.
From that moment on there was
a constant stream of dissatisfied fans
walking out!
I decided to stick it out, just in
case it got any better. About half
way through Carrie Wilson, of
Wilson Phillips fame, joined Rob
on stage, looing particularly
overweight. They sang a couple of
duets (in the same style) and then
together they did 'Every Kind of
People'. This went down very well
(the audience could be heard to
cheer as opposed to just clapping).
The hint wasn't taken and it was
back to the first half of the century.
By the end of the concert about a
quarter of the audience had
departed.
As an encore he actually sang
'She Makes My Day' (the highlight
of the evening) then with Carrie the
Nat King Cole classic 'Have
Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'.
These were well received.
He then came back for another
encore but he repeated a number
from earlier. At the end of that
everyone just got up and left.
Most people went home, like me;
feeling deceived and disappointed.
