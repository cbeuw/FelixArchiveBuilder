In Autumn 1960, what a blessing
Befell the devotees of Mineral Dressing.
(To Miners we must offer an apology:
The Course is now termed Mineral
Tech nology.i.
An angel sent by heaven, or so it seems,
Fairer by far than those of whom one
dreams.
Descended to the Royal School of Mining.
'Twos just the girl for whom all hearts were
pining.
Long had the Miners, in their misery,
Mooed in monastic masculinity.
At last a female form divine appeared,
And the Department's spirits upward veered.
Her regal presence graces every Ball,
Yet Morphy Day, without her, would annal.
The Sales of Felix she has helped to boost.
And. like a loving hen. has called to roost
The silvery guardians of the lactic brew,
:
To save and cleanse them, ere away thev
blew.
(For those whose comprehension hereby
stops.
We mean: she helps collect Milk Bottle
Tops.)
Fling off your shvness. Julie, and be seen'.
Descend to us, and be our Carnival Queen*.
For when your float round London starts
to chue.
At everybody's heartstrings you will tug.
We signed ourselves, dear Julie,

It is not often that the most beautiful female
member of a group happens to be the one
with the most attractive personality. This
situation, however, is common at I.C., oc-
curing wherever Andrea goes.
Although she is forced to spend several
hours a week travelling to and from her home
in New Maiden, Andrea plays an active part
in I.C. social and sporting life. Guildsmen
will recognise her as the brave intruder into
a Guilds Union Meeting last term. She was
sentenced to be flung into the murky waters
of the Round Pond, but her charm diverted
the stern course of justice, and the waves
were merely allowed to lap lovingly round
her lilyj
white feet . . . One cannot help wax-
ing lyrical when writing about such a one.
When allowed to escape from the rigours
of the first year Physics course, Andrea plays
hockey and sails on the Welsh Harp. Her
enthusiasm, balanced by shrewd judgement,
extends to everything else she does. She is
an ideal choice for the task of representing
I.C. during Carnival Week, for she is the
Queen of all Carnival Queens.
