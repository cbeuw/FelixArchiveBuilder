From the start of the second half Vets
forwards began a supreme effort to save the
game. On the churned up surface it became
increasingly difficult to get the ball away
from the scrums and line-outs and play be-
came a series of foot-rushes and robust ex-
changes between the forwards, which brought
much advice and encouragement from fam-
iliar voices in the stand. Several times Vets
were held only on the I.C. goal line and Ed-
ward's resolute and steady performance at
full-back was admirable. Hereabouts, with
the players hardly distinguishable for mud.
the field was a "darkling plain, full of alar-
ums of struggle and fight", and it was a re-
lief to see Kehoe's well-drilled forwards grad-
ually master the challenge and force play
back to mid-field. Once more I.C. began to
alack, now chiefly by kicking and fast follow-
ing-up. Both Milward and Butler came close-
to scoring in individual breaks, and Orman
and Rawlings on the wings made threating
runs. With their forwards neutralised, Vets
could only resort to kicks up field, which al-
ways found Edwards in position, and al-
though '(the score remained 6-0, I.C. were VETS B R E A K T H R O U G H
well in control in the fifteen minutes to the
final whisde. The Vets had played with great
determination in the most entertaining final r~
for sveral years but skipper Kehoe and his
men thoroughly deserved to receive the Cup
which was presented by Sir Douglas Loga.
I.C's win (their eighth in eleven seasons),
was the product of skill and hard work in
every position. The front and second row
forwards, who seldom show up in the spect-
acular movements, worked heroically, and
Smith at scrum-half played' excellently in
conditions which become increasingly atro-
cious.
