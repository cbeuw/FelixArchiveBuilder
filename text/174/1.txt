C o n g r a t u l a t i o n s to the Hyde Park
Road Relay Team, the Soccer Team, the
Sailing Club, the Boat Club — first VIII', the
Rugby Team and the Jazz Club for their
recent victories. A special note of congrat-
ulation to the Captains of these teams and
to the leader of the Jazz Club.
Two opposing points of view were ex-
pressed in the last issue of Felix. Colcutt,
who sets an example which I wish most re-
aders would follow, i.e. doing something for
the Union, stated that he wished we would
follow the advice of previous presidents. I
agree with him on this point and it is be-
cause each previous President has left a re-
port stating what he thought should be done
— even explaining from which quarters op-
position would arise — that I decided to put
some of these ideas into print. However, in
contrast to Colcutt's mature and sensible
comments, a person in an article 'All Change'
not only illustrated that he must be rather
narrow-minded and immature but even so dim
that he could not grasp the point of my pre-
vious article.
Two issues ago this column evpressed a few
ideas concerning what other facilities or act-
ivities the Union might be able to offer to the
students. The letters that I have received to
date show that most of these suggestions met
with interest and, in many cases, approval.
However, the number of letters were only
around the two dozen mark and were hard-
ly sufficient to start the ball rolling on any
one of these schemes so if you are interested
or if you completely disapprove, then w r i t e
and state your point of view.
For 'All Change's' benefit let me express
my point of view concisely and in another
way. I believe that more students should take
an active part in Union affairs and, simul-
tane-ously, the people responsible for oper-
ating the Union should have closer contact
with all the students. It is because of this
latter point that the secretary and (myself
find it better to operate the Union from the
office rather than from )the bar. Not that
there is anything wrong with the few who
are the core of the bar, but it is wrong to
limit our contacts by associating only with
one group and the bar core would be the
first to complain if we spent all Our time with
one other group. 'All Change' seems to think
that this is minor wrong and that my article
referred only to minor wrongs. Does he really
think that the fact that Felix, Phoenix and
Scrutiny are losing money is a small wrong
and that if we bury our heads and ignore this
that suddenly these publications will Start
breaking even? Apart from publications, my
article was concerned with additions, not
changes, to the present scheme and it is un-
fortunate that 'All Change' does not appriec-
iate the difference between a change and an
added facility or activity.
If 'All Cliange' is really distributed. I would
like to point out to him and to anyone else
who wishes to discuss any matter that I am
quite approachable the place for discussion
is the Union Office between 12.30 and 2.30
Apart from the many victories by various
p.m. on Tuesdays to Fridays inclusive.
Imperial College, teams, the Union has been
running a its usual steady pace these last two
weeks. The Council meeting next Monday
should, with any luck, decide some of the
questions concerning the Union Publications
so watch this column for comments in the
next issue.
This is the last issue of Felix this term
so best wishes for Easter vacations and try
to come back in the Carnival Spirit.
Congratulations again to
teams and their Captains.
the victorious
