Dixon Bowel
Last Saturday, Reading University visited
Putney for our annual regatta, over a 2\
mile course. The first VIII went down two
feet on the start, but rowed past Reading
by Hammersmith, and added 3 lengths by
Putney. The second VIII rowing well, opened
up an early lead, and won by 15 lengths.
The third VIII had a close race, drawing
away at the finish to win \ \ lengths. The
novice crews were outclassed, and were well
beaten in both races.
On Wednesday, the 1st VIII won the Dixon
Bowl, being the fastest college crew in the
University, the Second VIII were third.
Twenty five crews left Putney at ten seconds
intervals, and rowed to Moftlake. The first
VIII had a bad start, allowing Chelsea to
come up a length. On settling down, they
rowed right away from Chelsea, who were
second, beating them by 47 seconds. The
cox, steering a very good course, hardly used
his rudder. The University VIII, which looks
very fast this year, rowed over first beating
I.C. by 17 seconds. The first VIII are in a
critical state of improvement and should be
going much faster in a week or two.
