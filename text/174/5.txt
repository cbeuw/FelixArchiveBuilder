"WE WON
With last Saturday's success I . C equal-
led a 30 year-old record of a successive Cup-
final wins, set up by L.S.E., The game itself
could be divided into 2 distinct halves, the
second half being completely dominated by
I.C. which made up for the hard and even,
if somewhat unskilful, first half.
After being presented to the Vice-Chancel-
lor of the University, Q.M.C. won the toss
and I.C. kicked off. Within 5 minutes l.C.
took the lead, through a shot from short range
by centre-forward, Denny Vaughan, then lost
it when goalkeeper, Jim Ingrams completely
missed a seemingly harmless ball from the
lert wing.

Not long after Q.M.C. took the lead when
Bas James completely missed a long ball
down the middle* and Q.M.C.'s centre-for-
ward made use of a mistake from the edge of
the penalty area. Both teams throughout the
first half seemed very nervous of the occasion
with a negligible number of passing movements
taking place, and the long aimless ball
seemed to be the order of the day.
Just before half-tiu.e the l.C. supporters
who throughout the game were superior, both
in numbers and the amount of encourage-
ment given, had something to cheer then up
when the Q.M.C. goalkeeper went up for a
high ball, Ibeing hit by Denny Vaughah's
shoulder at the same time, who put the ball
in the net when it was dropped. Despite the
protests of Q.M.C. the referee allowed the
goal, and I.C. finished the firat half, very
fortunate to be level.
However, the second half was a different
story, when after 5 minutes Eddie Olding sent
what appeared to be a centre across the goal
from the right. It completely deceived the
Q.M.C. goalkeeper to finish in the left hand
comer of the net. From this time I.C. took
complete control of the game, the defence
tackling superbly, and attack being built up
from the defence.
" R I G H T M A N " !
The 4th goal resulted from a free kick taken
by Lawrie Austin who squared the ball to
Colin Harris who's thunderbolt shot from the
edge of the penalty area left the Q-M.C.
goalkeeper helpless. I.C.'s sixth goal was a
repeat of this, only from a square pass again
from Austin, who also scored the fifth goal
with a high lob from some 30 yards.
At full time I.C. were still on the attack,
and were unfortunate on a couple of occas-
ions not to increase their score, and so ended
one of the best U . L . cup-finals in recent
years, and with such a good victory I.C. fit-
tingly equalled the only record in the com-
petition which we do not already hold.
