Dear Sir,
You may be interested in publishing the
paotographs and the short note below in the
next edition of FELIX. We Zoologists have,
for some time, been irritated by having the
word " B O T A N Y " carved in stone above the
door of our Department, so we devised a
plan to cover it up, and at the same time to
add our own label.
Yours sincerely,
DICK WINNEY
A N C I E N T INSULT E X P U N G E D
On Thursday, March 1st at 2300 hrs after
the R.C.S. Smoking Concert, an expeditionary
force from the Zoology Depertment made
an assault on their own building to erase the
obscene word " B O T A N Y " , carved in stone
above the door, and replace it with the art-
istic masterpiece shown here.
ULU
- Jazz Festival -
Dramshot, an unturtored layman, reports
Despite the peculiar price of tickets. Bennv
Green, the incredible standard of some of the
competing bands, Benny Green, U.L.U.
Benny Green, and the Inca Civilization; a
fair selection of the University^ leading
beats, hops and cruds turned up to dance and
listen to the Jazz Festival. Much of the music
was interesting and entertaining, with a few
particularlv competent performances, notablv
from the Chelsea Modern Band, and, though
opinions differ, the tedious but interesting
Q.M.C. Band. Another enormously enjoyable
performance, came from U . C. H . Magnolia
Street Trad Band (I think) with Dick Foster
(sic) and a fine super-syncopated, contrapun-
tal, drummer; but the Group which was far
the most popular with the oudience was the
'U.C professional Band, holders of the
Modern Group Cup.
Two Bands from I.C. also enter* d ihe com-
petition, the Modern Jazz Consortium being
the first to appear, playing 4/5 of Richard
Rushton's original Suite 'Los Pasos', based
on the. history of the Moorish Culture and,
according to Benny Green, one Miles Davis.
The musical content of the pieces was avail-
able for judgement at the last Jazz Club
Concert and, in performance at U.L.U, the
Consortium were at their best. The I.C. Trad.
Group, holders of the Cup for that section,
were a)so in excellent form, with Murray
Smith providing a strong and fluent lead, on
a well varied selection of standars. As Chief
Judge of the Competition, Benny Green (of
the Observer), awarded the Trad. Cup to the
I.C. Group with no hesitation, and said that,
of four very good Modern Groups, that Cup
would also go to I.C., for the most interesting
and daring programme.
Dramshot imitation putty medallion* go
to all concerned; at least 17 to Rimshot.
