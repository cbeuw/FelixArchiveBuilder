T H E A I M O F T H E C A R N I V A L T H E T I M E A P P R O A C H E S C A R N I V A L P R O G R A M M E
The l'.C. Carnival has two principal aims,
roughly equal in importance: to have a good
timet and to provide money for War on
Want.
The first aim is self-explanatory. We do
not live in test-tubes; life is here to be en-
joyed and students are perhaps more cap-
able of enjoying it than any other group of
people. It must be emphasised, however, that
the enjoyment must be shared by everyone who
comes into contact with our Carnival. The
float procession is not a summer equivalent
of Morphy Day. The aim is to attract people
to the fete a week later. Flour-bomb throw-
ing or any other form of hooliganism is de-
finitely O U T !
This is bound up with the second aim of
the Carnival. We are not trying to squeeze
out what little money remains in students'
pockets. Kensington is a wealthy district and
we are trying to put over the idea that the
Imperial College Carnival, and particularly
the fete, is something worth coming to and
supporting generously. Last term's carol
singers paved the way splendidly.
We hope that this will enlighten those who
still have the idea that the Carnival, like most
College functions, is simply organised by
students for students.

This is the last Carnival Page of the term;
the next one will appear on the day of the
May Ball. Organisers of Carnival events,
floats, stalls, etc., are asked to buy this Felix
for last minute information, and to leave a
note in the Carnival Office if they want any
information to be included. They are also
asked to have everything ready as far as pos-
sible this term; there won't be much time next
term.
Our Carnival will be publicised at a meet-
ing in Kensington Town Hall on May 1st-
There will also be a street collection. We
need volunteers for this job. Please come to
the Carnival Office and put your name down.
Those who went carol singing last term will
know how profitable this can be. The Car-
nival Office on the ground floor of Weeks Hall,
is open every weekday funchtime from 12.30
to 2 p.m.
The second day of next term — Thursday,
April 26th — will be the occasion of a fab-
ulous Glamour Parade at I.C., where the Car-
nival Queen will be chosen. She will be given
a F R E E DOUBLE-TICKET to the May Ball, where
she will be crowned. Nominations must be
handed in to the Carnival Office by the end
of this term.
You will probably receive a book of raffle
tickets during the vaction. We hope you will
be able to sell them all.
