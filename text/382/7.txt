R A L L Y
T H E F I R S T ever F E L I X Annual Motor R a l l y w a s held last
Sunday afternoon. Although it was a rathe r c o l d day a l l the
teams duly arrived on time and had their vehicles checked by
officials of the City a n d G u i l d s Motor C l u b .Seven teams were
entered for the event, three each from G u i l d s and Mines a n d one
from R C S . Two o f the com-
peting vehicles were Clem
and B o ' a n d though C l e m
arrived back eariier, B o '
was placed hi gher on points
despite the fact that i t dev-
eloped a petrol leak o n the
return journey . R C S were un-
able to enter J e z as one of
their v e h i c l e s due to the fact
that she h a s been undergoing
extensive repairs (which are
still i n progress) since going
on the Brighton r u n .
The treasure hunt w a s i n
two legs, the first starting
from the Albert H a l l a n d fin-
ishing a t Tower H i l l .Here
each team had to purchase
example at Trafalgar Square,
" G e n e r a l l y , logs are not mil-
itary, naturally, but how long
did this one l i v e ? " The ans-
wer clearly relates to one of
the statues i n Trafalgar Squ-
are: General Napier, who
lived 1782-1853, a total of
7 1 y e a r s . Other c l u e s were
almost blatant: and at B u c k -
ingham P a l a c e , " H o w many
bared female breasts are
there o n the V i c t o r i a memor-
i a l ? " Answer: a suggestive
total o f twenty-two.
The result of the R a l l y
was announced i n the U n i o n
Bar a t 8.00pm by the Editor
who then presented the pot
This year's winners at Trafalgar Square,
an o l d age pensioner's and a
c h i l d ' s ticket of admittance
to the Tower. In addition
each driver and co-driver had
lo v i s i t Trafalgar Square
where they h a d their photo-
graphs taken by F E L J X
photographer Roger Wilkins.
One famous land marie
which the teams had to vi sit
the " d o m e d c a t h e d r a l " (St
P a u l ' s ) . T h i s proved to be a
trouble- some spot because
several of the teams arrived
while a service w a s i n pro-
gress . Thi s d i d not deter the
participants who q u i c k l y
found a solution to this diff-
iculty by making a quick
donation to the offertory box
and then a s k i n g the verger to
help solve the clue. It w a s
pern pas unfortunate that the
particular verger that most
teams encountered gave out
the wrong answer to one of
the more important q u e s t i o n s .
Whilst some clues were
dead easy, otteers possessed
unexpected subtlety: for
to the winners. It was c o i n -
c i d e n t a l that it w a s a Guilds
bar night on the same Sunday
night. Organisers and con-
testants a l i k e then proceeded
to celebrate i n fine style,
a n d it w a s generally accept-
ed that the first Rally h a d
been a successful one: The
results were:
l s t : C & G U (Paul Bentley,
Jenny Jones) with 70 points
Joint 2nd R S M U (Dave Car-
lile, Kevin Dabinett) and
C & G U (Peter Amey, Dru
Brown) bothe with 67 points
4th: R S M U (Richard le Sueur,
Justin Snelling) with 62 pts
5th C & G U (Charles Lamont,
Keith Ahlers) with 56 pts
Joint 6 t h : . R C S U (Chris Pol-
lard, Nick Roe) and R S M U
(Steve Bottomley, Denis
Gosney) both with 39 points.
May we, at F E L I X , ex-
press our thanks to a l l those
who took part; we look for-
ward to organising a similar
(but much improved) R a l l y
next year.
MONOPOLY
T o n y Jones
Last weekend saw one of the most ambitious R a g stunts for
some time. On Saturday morning, 13 teams of 3 or 4 people, each
armed with a mascot, were released from the R C S Union Office
on to the biggest Monopoly board in the world - London town
itself.
T h i s event was the c u l m i n -
ation of much hard work by
Martin Kessler, and Ian V i n -
cent, s i n c e the idea was first
mooted at an R C S Rag Comm-
ittee meeting over a year ago.
The a i m of the game was to
collect money for the Leukae-
mia Research Fund and have
a good time as w e l l . E a c h
team was provided with a list
of Monopoly sites to be v i s i t -
ed, and a question to be answ-
ered at each one. Teams scor-
ed five points for each correct
answer and ten points for each
pound collected.
Although the weather start-
ed off fine, it soon began to
rain, and wet, dishebelled
Monopolists were to be seen
tramping up streets as far
afield as Whitechapel and Old
Kent Road, begging for meagre
pittances en route.
Unfortunately, the total
amount collected for Leukae-
mia came to only £165 ; no
doubt this w a s mainly due to
the bad weather.
The winners, travelling
under the name of their mas-
cot "Jerry", collected a bottle
of w h i s k y for their efforts. The
fastest team was "Prawn-
Blaster" who returned after 4
hours, but it was not until
8.30pm that "Drum" crawled
up the steps of the R C S Office
after a 10 hour stint, soaked to
the skin(?l)
For the record, the final
positions of the teams toget
her with their points were as
follows:
1 Jerry, 770, 2 Top Hat,
460, 3 Gas Mask, 435, 4 Arm-
our,395r 5 Abo,375, 6, Kettle,
335, 7 Drum,315 8 Community
Chest,270, 9 Little Will,265,
10(equal) Prawn-Blaster, and
the combined efforts of guilds
and mines, 240, 11 Sunflower,
190, and Interstellar Duck,155.
