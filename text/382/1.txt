D.P. ELECTION
INQUORATE
IT WAS announced at yesterday's Election Results Union meeting that the threshold of
1024 votes required to make the election of next year's ICU Deputy President valid was
not reached. New elections for DP will therefore have to be held.
The voting for this election
took place last Monday, and the
F r i d a y before. T h e voting fig-
ures for the first day were est-
imated to be around 550 a n d
for the second d a y , around
300. T h i s means that the final
tion, l i v i n g in London e t c .
Such prospecti already exist at
other universities (eg Manche-
ster a n d Cambridge, amongst
others).
Although the idea h a s been
fully d i s c u s s e d a n d approved
by the U n i o n ' s A c a d e m i c Aff-
airs Committee, the C o l l e g e ' s
reaction appears to be m i x e d .
Whilst the Board of Studies
gave the i d e a a warm recep-
tion, the A d m i s s i o n s P o l i c y
Committee seemed almost i n -
different.
At last Monday's Council
meeting, where the d i s c u s s i o n
was presented by the I C U A c a -
demic Affairs Officer, C h a r l e s
L o u i s s o n , the reception w a s
encouraging . Concern w a s ex-
pressed regarding editorial
freedom and the need for chec-
king o f any opinions which
might be aired i n the p u b l i c a -
tion; but on the whole, Coun-
c i l appeared agreeable to the
idea in p r i n c i p l e .
voting figure was well below
its target.
The usual practise i s for
the result to be announced to
the U G M and the nomination
papers are put up a s soon a s
p o s s i b l e after t h i s . T h e
papers have, subsequently, to
stay up for t e n c o l l e g e days
with the elections to be h e l d
after a further five d a y s .
' E l l o , 'ello, 'ello! Wots this ere then?
E V E N the long arm o f the
law becomes interested when
you pose for a F E L I X photo-
grapher whilst parked on a
dbubl e-yellow l i n e .
â€¢ T h i s picture w a s taken a s
part o f the F E L I X Annual
Motor R a l l y which w a s h e l d
last Sunday . T h e actual clue
was to go to "Squat flag
arrear" (anagram o f Trafalgar
Square) and have a photo tak-
en. What could be more sim-
ple?
One can imagine the sur-
prise w h i c h befell Peter Amey
and D m B r o w n when the cop-
per strolled by and inquired
just what they were up to .
A l l ' s w e l l that ends w e l l
h o w e v e r no charges were
pressed (thank God - Ed.) so
the C & G U '2' team completed
the course a n d l i v e d to t e l l
the tale i n the bar that night.
