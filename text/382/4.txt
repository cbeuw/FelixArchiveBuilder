HON SEC
Jacqui Gerrard
Three years ago John M c C u l l o u g h , the President of I C U , pre-
pared a P o l i c y Statement. T h i s was a compilation of motions
passed by U G M ' s . He recommended that such a Statement should
be reviewed every year and completely rewritten every three
years. In the past three years no-one has reviewed it, until now.
I have almost finished com-
pletely rewriting the Statement,
bringing it up to date by incor-
porating in it a l l our new pol-
icy. It should be possible
each year for a supplementary
document to be published,
amending the present State-
ment.
The new document should
be ready just before Easter.
If you want some interesting
reading, please collect one
from the UnioB office. There
w i l l be more available just
after the Easter vacation . At
the A G M in May you will be
asked to accept the document
as a true statement of our
p o l i c y . It will be too late at
the meeting to say that you
have not had a chance to
check that it is a true state-
ment . so read it before the
meeting. If you wish you can
check it with the minutes of
the meetings.
Some people have asked me
why it is necessary to have
such a document. One of its
main uses is to delegates at
National Conferences. They
are supposed to vote accord-
ing to our policy (ie your w i s h -
es); thus the document enables
them to see at a glance what
those wishes are. It should
a l s o be of use to anyone pre-
senting a motion to a U G M .
It w i l l tell him how the Union
has felt in the past on that
typic.
// you do not like some of
the policy in the document,
present a motion to a UGM re-
versing or amending the policy.
A while ago every student received a card from Ensleigh Insur-
ance with a letter from Trevor P h i l i p s telling them that they were
insured against accident and death.
Most people ignored this, hence they are not making claims.
Y o u could c l a i m up to £10 per week for up to 104 weeks if y o u
are injured. T h i s covers you for
24 hours a day during term time
and during the vacations when you might be able to c l a i m , see
on any Union or College a c t - Trevor P h i l l i p s in the Union
i v i t y . Office or Mr Annas in College
It covers a l l I C U members of B l o c k and fill in a form .
a l l Union clubs and societies Y o u have nothing to lose,
and their a c t i v i t i e s . If you think y o u might have a lot to gain.
