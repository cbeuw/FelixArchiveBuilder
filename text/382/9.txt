Dear Mr Williams,
On behalf of the lorry and
other cars, I would like to
thank you and your staff for a
very enjoyable afternoon. I am
certainly going to enter again
next year with the same three
people who helped me around
the course thi s year. I w i l l
however not be satisfied un-
l e s s I come first next time.
Thanks again.

Dear Sir,
I would l i k e to take this
opportunity to reply to the
letter in F E L I X on F e b 28th
by M i s s Annabel L i s t z . I have
been known to play the o c c a -
sional game of pinball in my
time at college a n d I have to
admi t that I never had an or-
gas:,i w h i l e playing, this i s a
great dissappointment to me,
this i s probably something to
do with my p e l v i c action, per-
haps M i s s L i s t z might be able
to improve i t a s she i s o b v -
iously an expen on the sub-
ject, or i s she? In my opinion
this letter illustrates well a
phenomenon not uncommon at
IC namely female sexual frust-
ration.
Most women come to I C with
two thoughts i n m i n d , firstly
that I C i s a good college a c a -
demically and secondly that
because of the sex ratio at I C
their sex l i v e s w i l l be abund-
ant, what they do not seem to
realise i s even i f a boy i s des-
perate he will not go out with
a girl he does not f a n c y . Mi ss
L i s t z has been here at 1C for
V/i years and this i s obviously
an advanced case and she has
even degenerated to the extent
that she regards a pinball
machine as a p h a l l i c symbol,
I have never heard o f anywhere
where a man can satisfy him-
self for lOp as M i s s L e s t z
suggests.
In my opinion M i s s L i s t z
letter typifies the opinions o f
women at I C and I think that
their sexual frustration i s self
inflicted and i f women would
stop staying in writing such
drivle and get out and enjoy
themselves their l i v e s would
be much better.
T h i s letter w i l l obviously
cause controversy and I ex-
pect it might cause a flood o f
"catty" replies but I think
that these things have to b e
said.
Yours faithfully,
M.A.Hobson.
