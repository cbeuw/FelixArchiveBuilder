'.C. 1ST XV v. St. Edmunds Hall, Oxford.
During miserable weather some fine handling and rugby s k i l l s
were exhibited by both sides in this close game between two
closely matched teams. S t . Edmunds started the match with 14
men but IC found it difficult to c a p i t a l i s e on this i n i t i a l advant-
age. In fact St Edmunds took the l e a d after 20 minutes from a
penalty just outside the
twenty-five. F i v e minutes
later an Oxford back was forc-
ed to l e a v e the field, tempor-
arily injured, and during h i s
absence I C gained the lead.
T o their suprise the forwards
won quick second-phase b a l l
near the Oxford line and an in-
itial break by outside-half Ray
Hughes resulted i n a fine try
by M.Cotter, B F i n n e y convert-
e d .
A t half-time an extremely
courageous event occurred
when three spectators emerged
from Harlington bar to brave
the weather and watch the
whole of the second half on
the touch l i n e .Ten minutes i n -
to this half St Edmund's fif-
teenth player arrived (and i n
fact was their captain) which
considerably strengthened
their side. However IC stuck
to their job and despite the
loss of J jGilbert, who h a d to
retire with a badly bruised
shin, good tackling and deter-
mination from IC held the
score i n their favour ti 1
1 the
final w h i s t l e .
COMMENTS:
A w e l l deserved victory
w h i c h completes a double over
St Edmunds after beating them
away 1 8 - 1 2 last year. The
Extras
The last match of the sea-
son for the extras was against
E a l i n g R F C . B o t h sides had
15 men and a good game was
had.
F o r the first 10 mins the
extras defended their try line
w h i l e the opposition pressur-
i z e d us continually .Winning
most of the set b a l l the extras
fought back and then the break
came. E a l i n g ' s F u l l back h o i s -
ted a high ball which M.Spen-
cer (playing full back for the
first lime i n 5 years) caught,
k i c k e d and then chased i t . The
E a l i n g F u l l B a c k , didn't have
the same s u c c e s s with it and
M.Spencer k i c k e d the ball
along the deck over the line
and dived on it for an excel-
lent try. The E a l i n g players
came back hard and though
they had the advantage of the
ref . l o s i n g his pen where
held back . H a l f time 4 - 0 • •
In the Second half the ex-
tras returned the pressure and
were finally awarded a penal-
ty which M.Spencer k i c k e d
(7 - 0) .S.Chudy decided to go
for tea and b i s c u i t s and M.
Spencer dropped a goal from
30 yards.
The game continued in
much the same manner back-
referee was fair but slightly
hampered by his need to con-
tinually tuck his pension book
into his shorts thus keeping
him about 20 yards (sorry 18.76
metres) behind play. However
his age d i d not affect his ton-
gue in the bar and to B . A u s t i n s
discomfort related the age,
height, and sex of every Eng-
lish Internation from 1948 on-
wards.
At half-time Arthur was
seen 'aying down pesticide on
the pitch but w a s told that the
slugs were in fact the I C front
five. A good-time was h a d by
a l l on the resulting pub crawl
back to the U n i o n b a r . B . A u s -
tin deciding that he had not
suffered enough at the refer-
ee's mouth, walked out o f the
Queens and was cashed over
the head with an umbrella
which was wielded in the hand
o f a depraved Scotsman. L a t e r
he thought it might have been
something he s a i d .

Thi s was a good end to a

lost only 3 games and I think
drew o n e . P l a y e r s played in
Fremlin Pot
IC 'Open' Singles Darts Knockout Competition
Paul Whitlock, the winner (left) being presented with the pot.
M O N D A Y night saw the finals of this prized competition.
Eight years ago the Fremlin Brewery, later taken over by Whit-
bread, presented the pot; now known a s "The Fremlin", to Im-
perial C o l l e g e . L a s t Monday saw the climax of this years com-
petition which being the Fjnal night consisted of the quarter-
finals, semi-finals and the
final . T h e quarter finals were
played with twice winner B o b
Barley losing dramatically to
newcomer Dave Crook . T h i s
was followed by Mike (I want
to be Darts Club President
next year) G i b s o n losing to
Barry Shurety in a manner re-
miniscent of all great c l u b
Presidents .Next came the
match between P a u l Whitlock
and Pat Shurety; after a bit of
a hassle and cries of " r e f -
e r e e " P a u l sfotled home the
winning double . T h e last
quarter-final match was to
have been between Male
(Supercaptain, "we've only
lost one match this season")
Ran son and Derek (Superfuzz)
Forbes .However Superfuzz
failed to turn up with an ob-
vious attack of nerves
(apathy?) or was it fear and so
Supercap humbly went through
to the semi-finals. The semi-
finals started with a hard
fought clash between Dave
various positions usually de-
signated on the way to the
ground. P e o p l e were dragged
from their beds and volunt-
eered into playing . P l a y e r s
developed over the season and
I think IC rugby, though small
on Saturdays w i l l have no pro-
blem in admitting how good it
i s .
Thanks to a l l those who
played for us this season, well
done and good luck to those
who l i k e me are leaving this
year. I hope you carry on play-
ing wherever you go .
Crook and Barry Shurety the
outcome being that experience
counts, so Barry won. However
the second semi-final w a s
brilliant. T h i s of course was
between P a u l a (Hiya Fellas)
Whitlock and M a i (Supercap)
R a n s o n . It w a s a hard fought
game with P a u l a easily p i s s -
ing (oops sorry Ed) on h i s
" f r i e n d " the captain i n the
first g a m e . T h e following game
saw P a u l a completely bewild-
ered as Supercap streaked
through the game in 16 darts.
The last game was really the
antic Umax of what seemed like
a certain win for Supercap .1
need say no more than P a u l
won.
F i n a l l y , the final was play-
ed (excuse the pun ) This was
a hard game with P a u l obvious-
ly showing h i s confidence of
play beating Barry(Where were
the doubles) Shurety with ease .
Obviously his confidence came
from beating Supercap. Serious-
ly though, many congratula-
tions must be given to P a u l
Whitlock for winning the Frem-
l i n Pot in only h i s first year
at I C .
Thanks must also be given
to Brendan Clements for a l l
hi s help and advice in running
this competition to its succe-
ssful c o n c l u s i o n .
A l l I can say now is any
takers for next years competi-
tion and where was the support
from the Darts Club members
this year!?
