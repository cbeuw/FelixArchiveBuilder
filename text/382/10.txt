J a c k L l e w e l l y n
Gil Evans Orchestra: Plays the Music
of Jimi Hendrix (RCA) .
A G L A N C E at the title conjures up
horrific v i s i o n s of insipid, indefinite
schmuck dangling between the earthy
heaviness of Hendrix and the smaitzy
jazz of E v a n s . A quick once round the
turntable however soon shows such an
image to be nowhere near the truth for
this album is a musical fusion indeed.
The tracks are not a formal rehash of
Hendrix's music; rather, they are new ex-
pressions which succeed in establishing
new identities whilst generally retaining
the savoury electronic raunch and aggre-
s s i v e n e s s which s t i l l mesmerises so
many.
Undoubtedly the best cut is the leg-
endary "Voodoo Chile". The synthes-
iser lead is a touch of genius. This
album is a new aspect of Hendrix which
really needs to be heard to be believed.

Earth Juice: Return to Forever (Polydor
2001-543)
Taste blasted out at speed. C h i c k
Corea has got a driving drummer behind
him on t h i s , and Stanely C l a r k e , as us-,
ual, doesn't put a toenail wrong on bass.
The pace is fast and the melody is p u s h j
ed by guitar and organ in unison. It's the
sort of single that might make a listener
try and get hold of the album - in this
c a s e "Where have I known you before".
The B-side i s just a s impressive - pro-
g e s s i v e 7 0 ' s jazz played by musicians
with a b i l i t y and feeling. A s a single it
hasn't got a chance,-but that's to the
m u s i c ' s credit.
for them again. No expense has been
spared and if you liked the H o l l i e s in
the past this album wont disappoint you -
for anyone looking for sounds of Interest
there are numerous more suitable new
releases.
They do what they c a n , and play w e l l ,
but the songs have little to offer with the
exception of "another night" and "4th
July, Asbury Park", - meagre p i c k i n g s
on which to build an album.
Love: Reel-tc-Real (RSO 2394-145)
A new album from the reformed ' L o v e ' ,
and i t ' s quite impressive. T h e music is
soulful, based around the writing and
mannerisms of Arthur L e e . He c a l l s a l l
the shots and has produced an interesting
L P with a lot going for it. The sound is
full and complete. There's nothing m i s s -
ing and the band are obviously a tight,
well-rehearsed unit, never sloppy. The
brass arrangements stand out especially
when saxes are used to punctuate or lift
particular parts of a number.
A l l the numbers have been written or
co-written by Arthur L e e , except for the
tastefully-selected William D e Vaughan
s i n g l e "Be thankful tor what you got",
faithfully reproduced presumably ' c o s it
was always a nice tune. There's a l s o a
tremendously hot track c a l l e d "who are
you" worthy of the best d i s c o - if this
one doesn't get them moving i t ' s a case
of mass rigor mortis.
Lyn Collins: Rock itle Again
(Polydor 2066-490)
The vocals on this single comprise of
c r a s s lyrics belted out not unlike T i n a
Turner. They are repetitative in the-ex-
treme and seem to go on ad infinitum.
However, this is a l l superfluous. These
sounds come from the empire of Mr J B
and a s such, from the first note is endow-
ed with the indefinable but unmistakable
stamp-of effortless funk that almost a l l
his music exudes making would-be s u c -
cessors unworthy of comparison.
expertise (a thing that was never in
doubt anyway). The dynamic duo go thr-
ough the mechanics of standards like
Porter's "Love for Sale" and Gershuin's
"Lady be Good", a s well as sprinkling
the album with some instant originals.
Out of the two, P a s s ' s style is possibly
the more satisfying to listen to, leaning
much to the be-bop influence of Charlie
Parker, while E l l i s is slanted toward the
more conventional Charlie Christian and
Lester Young.
Anyone who thinks technique is the
be a l I and end a l l of guitar playing might
enjoy t h i s .

with the actual process of getting some-

after that the book is of equal use to any-
one going abroad without an infinite
amount of money .Although I haven't had
the chance to use it yet I can see that
its going to be invaluable; if the idea of

The Hollies: Another Night (Polydor
2442-128)
T h i s sounds like the standard sort of
album that the hollies have been putting
out for the last twelve years and could
go on doing s o till grave-time. They are
fairly predictable - losing popularity ana
favour, ending in lead singer A l l a n
Clarke leaving in 1972 to pursue a solo
career. Both singer and-group have a go
at it without getting anywhere and then

T H E rejuvenation of interest in jazz
guitar playing in recent years, be it Wes
Montgomery through Barney K e s s e l to

One of the musicians to benefit most
from this must be J o e P a s s , who of

this album does not fall into the Tate and

There are no other musicians involved
in the recording, which turns out to be

If you are interested in the movies
(right from their beginning) then buy this
book. It contains incriads of fascinating
information about films presented in a
quiz format. There are sixteen sections
on cinema topics from "The Silents"
through " W e s t e r n s " "Horror" "Musicals
and "Science Fiction", to "Movie

book can be interesting even to the be-
