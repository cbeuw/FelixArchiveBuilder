CROSS COUNTRY
L a s t Wednesday saw the
fifth and final league race
held on our home cource, 5'4
miles round Richmond P a r k .
At the top of D i v I was
Barts and only 13 pts behind
I C I, so'fingers out' was the
order of the day. The response
was varied. The course was
very fast, the first 22 runners
breaking 30 mins. and includ-
ing s u c h famous and notorious
athletes a s Rob A l l i n s o n in
8th p l a c e (28.37 mins), Speed
Steve Webb i n 12th (29.17) and
not only but also P a u l Clarke
22nd (29.59). J u s t outside the
30 min -Payne barrier were
A l f Garnet and the much bat-
tered and maligned (by
B e a n s ? ) captain J a n HIli s.
Dave Jones was spaced out at
30th leaving a Yo-Ho-Ho and a
pint of Youngs J i m Lad-Web-
ster to lead the 2nd team home.
Tony Weir followed in 39th
p o s i t i o n and the Tractor
coughed and spluttered i n at
44th j u s t behind the special
guest artist P A . B a x t e r . R i c h
Harrington, as spacer for the
2nd team, tackled this task
with great verve and no aplo-
mb, providing a space of 21
p l a c e s coming in at 65th. The
3rd team then gushed i n led
by N e i l B o a g a n d Dave Payne.
It was finally flushed out by
John Shearer, Andy Davey and
Andy F a i r h e a d .
A l l thse^ood runs, includ-
ing many personal bests were
weD compensated for by some
equally good personal worsts
recorded by the A l l Star C a s t .
Fourth team lead home by Wilf
Welford i n 85th. Pete Johnson,
who had to get up early that
morning, was a very creditable
87th . O u r 'three man lift' ex-
pert, Bob Ignacink was 90th
hottly pursued by P a d Don-
nelly. Dave Hunter was conn-
ed into running for us again
and nearly beat P a d who tried
to make a l l manner of e x c u s e s .
IC first team won the match
by 7 points from B a r t s thus
just failing to win the league.
In DivII, I C II were first, IC
III 2nd and 1 C I V , 11th. T h i s
means that there are now 3 I C
teams in Div I making up !4 of
the total! In the individual
championship, R . A l l i n s o n was
2nd. Steve Webb 6th and Ian
E l l i s 8th in Div I and N e i l
B o a g 2nd R i c h Harrington 4th
Mike Welford 6th and Hurrican
Houlbrookle 8th in Div II. The
L e a g u e A G M , medal presenta-
tion and p i s s up w i l l be at IC
on March 17 th .
The weekend w a s the
c l u b ' s busiest so far, with
races on both Saturday and
Sunday . 3 college teams com-
peted i n Nottingham U n i v e r s -
i t y ' s 5 x 3 mile road relay, on
a course round the campus
c o n s i s t i n g of a long boring
stretch of dual cainagenay and
two near-vertical h i l l s , one i n
each direction. T h e first stage
saw a minor selectoral mishap
when Dave Jones, representing
the second team, d e c i s i v e l y
beat A l f Garnett, representing
the first team. T h i s situation
was however rectified later in
the race. A notable appearance
was made for the third team by
V.Mooney, in h i s first race
since l a s t year's Newlands
Park Relay, and running con-
siderably faster than the re-
mainder of tfie team. Our fin-
ishing positions are unknown,
a s the promoters failed to pub-
lish the results before c l o s i n g
time: however it was noticed
that the start / finish w a s very
sparsely populated when the
third team finished.
T h e evening was spent
sampling some l o c a l varieties
of real a l e , the more dedicated
members f i n i s h i n g by j o i n i n g
an old-folk's sing-song i n a
Young's house i n 'Ackney (the
spotty centre of the metro-
p o l i s ) .
Amazingly, It people man-
a g e d to get up on Sunday mor-
ning i n time for another race,
starting at 1 l a m . T h i s w a s the
London F i r e Brigade 4 x 3
mile relay, each stage being
2 laps of a circuit of Lambeth
and V a u x h a l l bridges a n d the
embankments between .The
organisers had limited the en-
tries from each establishment
to 2 teams, and a s a result the
l i s t of entries was graced by 2
teams from the Royal C o l l e g e
of M u s i c . After half of the first
stage a feeling od deja vue
was present as Dave J o n e s
(IC 2) had a 20 year lead over
Ian E l l i s (IC 1); however the
order had been reversed at the
end of the stage. Both teams
performed excellently, the first
team (Ian E l l i s , 15:13; Steve
Webb, 15:03; P a u l Clark, 15:
16; Rob A l l i n s o n , 14:19) fin-
ishing 11 th i n 59'51, c l o s e be-
hind teams from some of the
best c l u b s in the South-East.
The second team (Dave Jones,
15:21; A l f Garnett, 15:45; N e i l
Boag, 1 5:58; Dave Houlbrooke
(everybody's favourite m i s -
print), 15:52) were 20th in 62:
56. A measure of the clubs
improvement this year i s that
S O C C f R
L a s t Saturday's 2nd XI opponents were something of an un-
known quantity, as we had never played them before, and after
our s c i n t i l l a t i n g display, I doubt they w i l l be i n any hurry to play
us again. T h e whole team played as if they had been born with
their h o c k e y - s t i c k s in their hand, just waiting for this match.
The first half started off
quietly as w e tested the oppo-
nent's defense, but, as we
realised their full backs were
a bit slow, shots began to
shower in on the goalkeeper.
Despite all this pressure,
though, we only managed to
net one goal, from Andy Brew-
ster, a particularly v i c i o u s
shot from a yard out!
At half-time, it was gener-
ally thought we should have
had several more, with such
attacking play down both
wings, and determined support
from all the half-backs, P e t e
N o w e l l , in particular, who had
a splendid game, and even
managed to ref. at the same
time .
previously no-one had broken
15:30 for this course, and our
teams have recorded times of
c 65 minutes in the l a s t two
years.
The motley collection of
musicians finished 31st a n d
40th respectfully, including a
particularly good run by the
remains o f Ian Isherwood.
None of the times however
aumpare very favourably with
the 13:17 recorded by one A .
Simmons of L u t o n , who knock-
ed an enormous chunk off the
stage record.
F i n a l l y , it had been hoped
to publish in this weeks report,
a l i s t of erraQ for last weeks,
report, but it has been d i s c o v -
ered that this would be rather
too long to fit in F E L I X , and
would probably be misprinted
anyway. However ti should be
noted that the team holding the
away match on F e b 19th was
B R U N E L , not B R U N C H .
The London Inter - Collegiate T a b l e T e n n i s league h;i^ start-
ed this term, (a little late maybe, but it has started), and both
our teams are doing extremely w e l l .
The 1 st team i s top of div .
I. and unbeaten even though
i t ' s composition i s a l i t t l e un-
predictable due to the vast
number of good players we
have .Starting w i t h a walk-over
against Q M C ; G . K i n g , A . B e a l
and C.Too then had an easy
1 0 - 0 against the Institute of
E d u c a t i o n .
T h i s w a s followed with an
e s p e c i a l l y good w i n by Y
Cheuk, C . T o o and S.Gunasing-
ham, each of whom had until
recently l i t t l e or no match ex-
perience. Nevertheless, our
team went to C h e l s e a c o l l e g e
and beat their second team
9 - 1 .
The following week G K i n g ,
C . T o o and S.Gunasingham,
beat a strong Bedford 1 st team
7 - 3 ; their c l o s e s t match so
f a r . T h e crunch should come
in the next fortnight when they,
(hopefully), meet C h e l s e a I
and then University College.
The second team, Steve
D e s b r u s l a i s , Brian C l a r k and
Graham Healy, had similarly
had no match experience until
recently. Despite losing their
first match 10 - 0 to the Royal
Dental H o s p i t a l , they have
never looked back, and recent-
ly thrashed Institute of E d u c -
ation II 7 - 3, and Bedford II
9 - 1 . T h i s , coupled with a
walk over against Q M C p l a c e s
them c l o s e behind R D H on set
average.
Due to the arrangement of
this league, (by me, under pre-
ssure), the p l a y i n g of matches
i s very much i n the air, and
some c o l l e g e s are c o l l e c t i n g a
m a s s i v e backlog. E v e n so
Imperial C o l l e g e appears to be
showing i t ' s undoubtable, (by
me anyhow), strength at this
sport.
The second h a l f brought
some respectability to the
score, Andy Brewster scored
as a result of a short corner
in the first minute, and this
was q u i c k l y followed by G i n s
Parker netting, despite vehe-
ment appeals for offside (which
he wasn't). In one of their few
raids into our half, Rothamp-
stead managed to snatch a goal
back, but this was q u i c k l y
overshadowed by two further
goals for us, one by Andy
Brewster (again!), making his
h a i r i c k (which he no doubt re-
gretted in the bar afterwards).
Chas Hardy added another one,
but, with the last hit of the
match Rothampstead p u l l e d
another ore back, so the final
score was 6 - 2 .
Team: N.Harrison: J. Huckle:
P.Nair; A.Turner; P Mowell;
J.Brownridge; D.Balderson;
I.Read; C.Parker; A.Brewster;
C.Hardy.
RIFLE
CLUB
The past few weeks have
seen the annual shoot-out be-
tween G u i l d s , R C S and, much
to everyones (at least i n the
R i f l e Club( suprise, R S M for
the small-bore (.22 calibre)
prone rifle trophy, "The Court-
man Shield" . The competition
was won for the third year run-
ning by G u i l d s , of course,
after a closer competition than
has been the case for some
years. Both G u i l d s and R C S
were f i e l d i n g strong teams;
Mines were represented by
some very dubious talents,
thus following a tradition that
goes back almost unbroken for
many years.
The trophy goes to the first
c o l l e g e to w i n two rounds, and
this year went to Guilds on
winning two rounds to R C S ' s .
Round One was a narrow vict-
ory to R C S , after holding, and
loosing most of, a considerable
l e a d at first. Round Two went
to G u i l d s by an equally narrow
margin, but the G u i l d s team
shot a very commendable aver-
age of 96 out of a possible
100. The teams thus went into
Round Three l e v e l . B o t h s i d e s
were unable to maintain the
form of previous rounds but
R C S dropped most after some
suprising results giving the
round and the competition to
G u i l d s , a s was to be expected.
Nobody paid any attention to
what Mines were doing.
Congratulations to the team
