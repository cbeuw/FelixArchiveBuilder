FELIX
SO T H E frolicking, the c l i c k e mon-
gering, the bumpho-postering and the
writing o n the w a l l is not quite over
yet. There are to be further elections
for the non-sabbatical post of I C U De-
puty President sometime next term
simply because the threshold of voters
required for the election to be valid
was not reached. The question must be
asked why was the threshold not
reached?
Some blame the candidates: "They
clearly did not put enough work into
their campaigns". Granted that the old
but highly lucrative (interms of votes)
trick of person -tw-person canvassing
which has been so successful in past
years w a s absent this year on the
whole, 1 understand that a lot of effort
was put into distributing posters and
bumph sheets as widely a s p o s s i b l e
(even as widely a s South K e n . tube
station).
Others blame the peculiarity of this
year's election system: "Since iheO.P.
candidates were known days before the
main election, why couldn't the Deputy
President have been elected along with
the Hon. Sec. and Editor of FELIX?"
The simple answer is that constiution-
ally it is not allowed: had the D . P . can-
didates put their names up at the same
time as the other candidates, a l l would
have been w e l l . The peculiarity arose
when an extension of time for nomin-
ations was required because no candi-
date for the post was fully seconded.
Thus it can be construed that it was the
candidates' fault for not getting their
names up in time.
Some take a different attitude alto-
gether: "By failing to draw out the re-
quisite number of voters, the candidates
can interpret the result as a vote of no
confidence in themselves",
This may be so, but I have my
doubts. Whatever might be the rights or
wrong's of this affair, the fact remains
that at the main elections, it took four
candidates and two very hard fought
campaigns for two sabbatical posts to
just scrape over the voting threshold.
T o ask just two candidates to recreate
such enthusiasm witha similar doubled-
up performance must surely highlight
the fact that our constitution does not
really cater for a l l the conceivable
situations that might arise at election
time.

Congratulations to C o u n c i l on fin-
ishing so early last Monday at 8.40pm.
P i t y that the President was at U L U at
(he time, for he would have been pleas-
ed, I'm sure.

Dear Sir,
1 abhor the arrogance of
F r a n c i s Toye, Tom Abraham
and others who have recently
attacked, through F E U X , the
National F r o n t ' s stand against
immigration. F o r let it never
be forgotten that nobody ever
o n s u l t e d the B r i t i s h P u b l i c
before allowing Britain to be-
come a multi-racial state.
Today the N U S i s demand-
ing that overseas fees be re-
duced to that for the home
student, even though this
w o u l d lead to even fewer uni-
versity p l a c e s for ordinary
B r i t i s h folk. Furthermore,
there i s a myth that immigrants
a v o i d participating in p o l i t i c a l
a c t i v i t i e s ; the leader of the
International S o c i a l i s t s i s an
Israeli passport-holder, and
similariy the International
Marxist Group is led by an Ox-
ford-educated P a k i s t a n i , Tariq
A l i . Both organisations are be-
h i n d v i c i o u s assaults on indi-
vidual students in c o l l e g e s
throughout B r a i n , and both
support the murderous I R A .
Of course, anybody who has
the courage to speak up again-
st these dangers i s immediate-
.y branded as a fascist by
these people.
Yours faithfully,

In reply to John Mortimer
City & Guilds Union,
7th March 1975.
Dear Sir,
May I take space in your
newspaper to extend my deep-
est sympathy to Mr John Mort-
imer. It pains me greatly to
see a once sane man reduced
to the inane ramblings of his
article in the lst issue of
F E L I X (No. 381).
H i s pretensions to grand-
eur and delusions of the stat-
ure of RSMU are to be expect-
ed, but the multitude of fact-
ual i n a c c u r a c i e s could only
have been concocted by a man
not in the full possession of
all h i s faculties. T h i s may
have something to do with the
long separation of John from
h i s mascot, which obviously
adds weight to the theory that
the M i n e s ' Braincell i s in fact
kept i nsi de D a v y .
The extent of Mines' brain-
power was fully illustrated by
their purchase, for £50, of a
wooden replica of Davy, which
was in fact built and painted
in under four hours. On the
subject of money, Mines
should be grateful to G u i l d s
for giving them the motivation
for their record £7 20 rag c o l -
lection, on which we congrat-
ulate them.
In conclusion let me reiter-
ate my sympathy for the R S M U
President, and a l s o his U n i o n ,
whom he so rightly feels are
i n need of such egotistical
piopoganda as constituted the
aforementioned article.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,
We had almost become imra-
.une to the interminable whining
of pampered, grasping women.
The o c c a s i o n a l murmerings of
the post were tolerable but the
present fern, lib .campaign i s
utterly nauseous.
Women should stop moaning
about their l o t . They are not
underprivileged. Recent cam-
paign h a n d b i l l s distributed by
the Bra-Burner Soc .(or what-
ever they l i k e to c a l l themsel-
ves) tell us that I C has only
c.a. 10% women .The fact i s
that women should never be
allowed into any university
since it diverts them from their
true function a s w i v e s and
mothers looking after the home.
It i s a scientific fact that
the brain and nervous system
of women i s , i n general, l e s s
highly developed than that of
men. T h i s i s shown over and
over again We only need to
look at the great achievements
of history to realise that men
provide the drive and brains
for advancement. Women are
only capable of playing a sup-
porting role, a c t i n g a s instru-
ments of pleasure and provid-
ing entertainment for the bread-
winner.
Proof of the inferior i n t e l -
lectual capacity and i l l o g i c a l
thought processes of women i s
available here at I C . C o n s i d e r
the i s s u e of the U n i o n B a r . O n
the one hand they demand ad-
m i s s i o n to what ought to be a
men-only bar and on the other
they refuse men admission to
the ICWA lounge except at cer-
tain times (wondrous conces-
sion!) It really is about time
women were returned to their
correct place i n the social
structure, and while we are
about it lets' restore the Union
B a r to i ts rightful status of a
men-only bar.
Y o u r s sincerely,
D a v i d Seal

Dear Sir,
I notice that a large number
of pro-euiopean posters have
been removed from all over
college. While I am aware that
this i s the usual level of de-
bate, 1 feel that since our
Union i s c a l l i n g for democracy
these puerile tendancies should
be curbed.
Y o u r s faithfully,
