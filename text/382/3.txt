T H E L A S T ever Sunday Times National Student Drama Fest-
ival is to be held in London's West E n d next month ... and wi II
feature IC Dramsoc's Christmas production of "Albert Bridge".
The selection of Dramsoc's
production from over 100 ent-
ries must surely rank as one
of the most significant achiev-
ements of any IC society, soc-
ial or sporting, for many years .
L a s t night a spokesman told
me: "Naturally we are delight-
ed. The Festival is acknow-
ledged all over the world as
representing the cream of
British student theatre, so (or
us, a drama group in a college
of science and technology,
the selection is doubly satis-
tying. ''
Albert's Bridge" was
written by Tom Stoppard as a
radio play, but adapted for the
stage and directed at Imperial
by Denys Bennett. Details
have yet to be finalised, but
tie play w i l l appear at the
C o l l e g i a t e Theatre (University
College) on M O N D A Y A p r i l 7th
for two performances, matinee
and evening.
But what of the rest of the
F e s t i v a l ? I spoke to C l i v e
Wolfe, the F e s t i v a l Director:
"This year's 20th Anniver-
sary Festival runs from April
6th to 12th, and will be the
most ambitious ever. Several
West End theatres are being in-
corporated, including the Royal
Court, the Young Vic and the
Theatre Upstairs."
"In addition to the selected
British student productions,
there will be invited groups
from Li son and Turkey, and
David Ponting will bring his
acclaimed one-man Dylan
Tiomas show. There will also
be some practical workshops
including movement sessions
taken by John Broome, former
choreographer with the Royal
Shakespeare Company.''
Season tickets for entry to
a l l F e s t i v a l events and shows
are a v a i l a b l e now, and indivi-
dual tickets from March 24th.
Enquiries should be made to
the F e s t i v a l offices at 20,
Lansdowne Road, N.10, tele-
phone 8834586 .Watch out for
posters and leaflets around
college!
Bu beneath IC Dramsoc's
successful exterior, life has
not been a bed of roses. In
fact this year has been char-
acterised by a shortage of
enthusiastic stage and tech-
nical crew, which almost re-
sulted in the cancellation of
the Drama F e s t i v a l entry. A s
most people are aware, Dram-
soc is not concerned solely
with its own productions, but
provides an essential service
to other societies such a s
Opsoc, Ents and F o l k C l u b for
their stage shows; to the
C C U ' s for their revues, and to
individuals for prqvate part-
i e s . At present Dramsoc relies
heavily upon a small group of
dedicated people who are, not
suprisingly, overworked. There-
fore, if.you feel that you have
anything to contribute, from
acting to sewing buttons on
costumes,.or from set design-
ing to painting scenery, please
v i s i t the Dramsoc storeroom
,(3 flights of stairs above the
Union Office) or telephone
internal 2854 . If your exams
are too pressing just now then
remember Dramsoc next Octo-
ber.
Your college drama group
has reached the pinnacle of
student theatre, but it needs
your help and support if it is
to stay there.

I W O U L D like to make a plea for the return of the death-bed .
What b l i s s it must have been to have your last effort of courage-
ousness watched by those who remembered your w i t t i n e s s , your
intelligence, your generosity or your alertness. A n d what a c o n -
trast to these days when a nurse, however dedicated, silently
wishes that you would expire
wither before or after t e a -
break . H o w much more dignif-
ied to die from a fall or of hyp-
othermia rather than euthan-
a s i a . But we are no longer
allowed to do so. Doctrines
demand that we herd together
a l l those who cannot even feed
themselves, to be fed, washed
and fed again, in hot-house
surroundings until some unfort-
unate doctor is c a l l e d upon to
make the fateful d e c i s i o n .
In a l l spheres we are repla-
c i n g our individual responsib-
i l i t i e s with policies and are
rapidly declining towards tot-
a l i t a r i a n i s m . The Natiorial
Health Service wanted to rid
itself of private patients,
thereby ridding itself of their
financial contribution. It is
now campaigning to dis allow
the natural consequence, the
setting of up private c l i n i c s -
and this in a " f r e e country"!
A similar evolution c a n be
seen in the field of education.
Not only are the government
cutting down on education
spending (as the population
grows older more is being a l l -
ocated elsewhere) but the s o c -
ialists require that their state
system be implemented u n i l -
aterally, without regard to
local opinion. T h i s may lead
to a total dependence on State
spending for education which
is at present relieved by the
thousands who do not choose
to take advantage of the.state
schools . The current grants
campaign K i t would help if the
posters were grammatically
correct) a l s o aims to transfer
&':
tl responsibility from the.in-
dividual to the State. Redist-
ribution of wealth is one thing,
total dependence on the State
is another! We are gradually
being conditioned to believe
that one form of schooling is
the right form of schooling, but
what if our priorities differ?
And they do - according to our
environment, our religion, our
c a p a b i l i t i e s or our expecta-
tions.
Philosophies and aggress-
iveness seem to be considered
the answer to everything. So-
c a l l e d intelligent people (Rose
Dugdale, U l r i k e Meinhof) no
longer feel it necessary to
develop their arguments but
can only offer destructive re-
actions.
Why don't the National
Front members, who have been
getting so much publicity
lately, try to be more profit-
able than the Jews in business,
better at boxing than John
Conteh - or whatever, instead
ot demonstrating and distribut-
ing leaflets.
A little less doctrinism and
a little more common sense
