special relationship, the play
examines the position of women in
modern society, displaying beautifully
the difficulty in reconciling the
traditional role of wife and mother
with that of the independent career
woman.
Rumblings by Peter Gibbs is a
comedy for five men and a woman.
It highlights the pettiness of office
politics as well as greed and .suspicion
in individuals generally.
It is set in the not too distant future
where unemployment stands at six
million and England has become an
area of increasing seismic activity.
The action takes place in an office
where all jobs are effectively
redundant; however, official
redundancies are restricted to 3 % of
the workforce per year, selected by
a computer. As the date of the
selection approaches, earth tremors
damage the computer, and thus the
office is disrupted.
Tongues and Savage Love by Sam
Shepard and Joseph Chaikin are a
' double bill for a cast of no set sex,
as the two pieces explore aspects of
that emotion of many faces, love.
Tongues is an exciting orchestration
of percussion and human voices
« describing their" feelings and past
experiences.
Savage Love is a collection of
poetry expressing different views of
love and its effect on people.
For those people who are interested
in attending the Edinburgh Festival as
part of Theatre West End in the
technical or artistic aspects, there will
be a reception on Sunday, May 1st at
7pm in the Concert Hall. Come along
and eat, drink, and find out more
about that eighth wonder of the world,
the Edinburgh Festival.
WATERSKI
It's the
season of
'knock 'em
dead'!
Well summer's here again! The
season of 'knock 'em dead'
beachwear, T won't be home again
tonight, Mum' beachparties, and 'if
I say no I mean yes' beach-bunnies,
is back! And hopefully (just for a
change) some glorious weather! But
how are you going to make the most
of your free time? If you were
thinking of staying in London (heat-
sink of the universe), why not think
again? Why not break out and enjoy
yourself in the smog-free count: yside
of Burghfield Waterskiing Club?
Whether you want to try a new
sport, further a current interest, or
you just want to pose on or by the
water in your new 'genuine, latest,
US designer' beachwear, the
Waterskiing Club is for you. Not only
will you be taught to ski or helped to
improve at waterskiing, but you'll get
the chance (weather-permitting) to
improve that all-over tan!
It's a truly exhilarating experience
skimming across the water at high
velocity—so why not give it a try? If
you or any of your friends are
interested, come see us on Mondays
at 12.30pm above Southside or
contact us through the pigeonholes.
(Car owners particularly welcome!
Open to members of staff as well).
RACING SOC?
Interested?
We're hoping to form a racing
society, hopefully up and running by
the start of next academic year. There
seems to be a lot of students (and
staff) in this college who like a bet or
two on the ponies, so it seems natural
to form a horse racing club.
The aims of the club will be:
• To organise subsidised trips to race
meetings around the country.
• T o obtain group discounts on
magazine subscriptions, Timeform,
racecards, etc.
• To encourage sensible betting.
• To promote horse racing as the
fine, upstanding sport that it is.
Anyone vaguely interested, please
reply to Box 721, FELIX, Beit Quad.
