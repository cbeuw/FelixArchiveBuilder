Wo 337 30th May 1973
the direction FELIX was to take in the
Seventies. It took two years to come
to any firm decisions but the Union
finally agreed that it would fund the
production of the newspaper. Students
would be able to read FELIX free of
charge. It was FELIX no 302, edited
by Oily Dawson, which was the first
to declare itself editorially and
financially FREE.
Half a year later a motion was taken
to the Union's Council that FELIX
should be published weekly and
incorporate all other ICU publications
that had sprung up around it. It was
also agreed that the Editor would have
to become a sabbatical post in order
to carry out the job satisfactorily, and
it was accepted that the paper would
have to drastically increase its
advertising revenue.
On Friday 13th September 1974
FELIX entered a new era when it was
printed for the first time by offset litho
on the College premises. This was to
be the era of faulty equipment,
endless nights and tired and emotional
Editors. It was the final step in a
series of attempts to make FELIX
more immediate and accessible.
Editor Mike Williams heralded it as
a chance for a stronger FELIX and
it was a period of intense optimism
for everybody who was involved with
the paper. The problems with the
Print Unit were still to come.
For the next few years FELIX
became a weekly twelve or sixteen
page booklet, still with a heavy clubs
and events orientation. It also brought
out special issues such as its careers
supplement, still with us today, the
FELIX Motor Rally and photographic
competitions. By the end of the
decade the Union had invested in a
litho and phototypesetting system for
the Print Unit so that the FELIX
Office was now producing the
Handbook, Alternative Prospectus
and the Phoenix. The Office had also
moved down to a suite in Beit Arch,
making the paper even more
accessible to the average student.
It must have seemed that FELIX
had everything going for it but both
the Seventies and the Eighties have
seen major clashes between Union
Officers and the FELIX Editors. In
1976 a motion of no confidence in
Editor Clive Dewey was proposed by
both the Union and his own staff over
his handling of the staff and the dire
financial situation he had allowed the
paper to get in after spending most of
his budget on one issue in the Autumn
continued on page 15
ACCOMMODATION: FROM ONE HOSTEL TO HALLS, HOUSES AND HEAD TENANCIES
When FELIX was first published in 1949, there was only one hostel for use by IC students,
Beit Old Hostel. Residents were not allowed overnight guests in any shape or form and were
woken up by bells every morning.
Despite the addition of a new hostel in No 12 Princes Gardens for 24 men, hall capacity still
lagged far behind demand and the Union complained that this was the reason very few students
were interested in Union affairs.
College decided that it was time to build more accommodation and took on an ambitious
plan to build halls of residence around Princes Gardens. The first hall was Weeks, donated by
Vickers in return for guaranteed places for their engineering students. Unfortunately after Weeks
had been built they discovered that the concrete they had used could be dissolved by water!
The next halls were Southside and Linstead with plans to build a sports centre and another
hall on the Northside site—when the money ran out.
The only addition that has since been made to the site was an extension to Linstead made
possible by a mystery donation of £350,000. Even the simple addition of this extension was
fraught with problems when local residents demanded that the new building should be attractive!

FIFTEEN MILLION POUND
For the last year the peaceful
calm of Imperial College ha. been
shattered by the roar of the a i r -
compreeaor and the chatter of the
pneumatic d r i l l . The builders are
in, and they will be staying with us
for several more years. Between the
years 1953 and 1962 the student pop-
ulation of this College w i l l be ex-
panded from 1500 to over 3000, To acc-
omodate the extra numbers the College
and Union Buildings will be added
to, and in son. cases, modified.
It is a vast oroject, involving the
expenditure of £15 millions of pub-
lic funds.
During the past eighteenraonths
four preliminary projects have been
put in hand. One has been completed:
a fourth storey having been added to
theR.S.M. and Goldsmiths' extension
of Guilds, The architects were Gor-
man and Dawbaro. The Union Building
(N. side of the Beit Building, close
to the Albert Hall) Is being convert-
ed from a two-storey building of
25,000 sq. f t . to a four-storey
building of 50,000 sq. f t . Work
began in July '54 and i s due to be
completed in July '56. A permanent
refectory lsalready installed in the
ground floor of this building. The
architects ar. Sutclif f and Partners
with Sir Hubert Worthlngton as con-
sultant .
No 79 4th October 1955
At the end of the fifties. College took on an
ambitious building project aimed at removing
the old Imperial Institute and replacing it with
what we know today as the Imperial College
'Island Site'. All that remains of the original
Thomas Collcut building is the Queen's Tower.
The scheme was not without its critics, who
included Sir John Betjeman who was invited
to cut the first slice from an effigy of the
Institute made of iced cake by the College
Refectory staff.
It was not until the end of the sixties that
the main College block, Sherfield, was due to
be completed. After the Island Site, Blackett,
and Roderick Hill Aeronautical Engineering
Block had been completed, W 2 - n o w
affectionately known as the Huxley
Building —was built to house the ever-
expanding Physics Department, Mathematics
and Computing.
The most recent addition to IC has been the
new Computing Building next to the walkway
which should be opened any year now!

THE RISE AND POTENTIAL FALL OF WEEKS HALL
IS WEEKS H A L L about ti
is :— in the short term, pi
term it is quite a possi
built fifteen years ago. W
i
fact that the concrete bit
window were continually
crumbling and creating a
potential hazard for
passers-by. Contractors
work on the replacement
of the blocks started at
the beginning of the
summer at a cost estimated
to be in the region of
£40,000.
There is speculation
as to why the blocks are
falling apart. Mr. P.W.
Throsby, Harden of Weeks
Hall, suggested that it
might be 'natural decay
j fall down? The answer
obably not, but in the long
iility. Ever since it was
eks has been dogged by the
•ck facings just under each
from moisture etc.', but
several engineering P C s
have suggested to F E L I X
that in fact the building
ay have be inadequately
designei tbe gist be
heating pipes had to be
drilietT right through the
concrete blocks and this
tended to disturb the
inherent tensile strength
of the concrete.
As though this were
not bad enough, misfortune
struck Weeks Hall again
. when it was discovered
that the concrete in the
beams supporting the
building was a special
quick-drying, high alumina
type and it was concrete
of this nature which,
apparently, was thought
to be responsible for the
, roof of a school collapsing
about a year ago.
As a result consultants,
Messrs. Clarke, Nicholls
and Marcel, were appointed
at a cost of £8,000 to
assess the hall by means
of a physical testinvolvin
deflectometers pi
by the Civil Engit
video
Department here at I C .
It would appear that
further internal r e -
inforcement work on each
room is a possibility
which is not being ruled
out. Meanwhile, it has
just been learnt that
Weeks Hall will be
evacuated for at least
the first term. Presumably
the hall residents will be
filtered into places in
residence created by
students who fail their
exams and Vlth formers
who fail their A - l e v e l s .
It is tough luck on
those who are top of the
reapplicants reserve lists
though.

After halls and the Evefyn Gardens houses, College started
acquiring head tenancies in Hamlet Gardens and the
Fremantle Hotel on Cromwell Road. Enticingly marketed
to Freshers as a 'five star' tenancy, it was, in fact, pest-
infested and rundown and most ex-tenants were seen
cackling when it finally burnt down in 1985.
Hamlet Gardens has also had its fair share of criticisms
recently. Although College are keeping some of the flats

After building work had stopped on the
Princes Gardens site. College decided
to acquire houses in Evelyn Gardens
for development. Mining House was
purchased in 1967 and the latest
addition, Fisher Hall, was added last
year.
Although College are unable to
guarantee a year in hall next year, they
are still offering more places now than
they have ever offered before.
ACCOMMODATION CRISIS
College slashes
re-app places
There will be a reduction in the number of re-applicants
places in Halls and Houses next session in order to provide
enough rooms for first year students. This is necessary
because of the impending loss of the Fremanlle Hotel.

THE FLATS IN Hamlet Gardens may not be available for
student accommodation next year. The landlords who own the
flats want to raise the rent, which means that students may be
asked to pav up to £35 for a double room, an increase of nearly
50%.

College will nol be able lo honour their guarantee of a year in hall
to all first year undergraduates and overseas postgraduates next year,
