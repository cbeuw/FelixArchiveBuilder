New phones
for Halls
New internal telephone exchanges
have been installed to serve Fisher
Hall and Halls on the North Side of
Princes Gardens. Tables 1 and 2 detail
the phone numbers on each exchange,
and how to dial from the main College
exchange. These telephone exchanges
are of the latest electronic type and
support a number of extra facilities:
-To call a number on the main
College exchange dial 72 followed by
that number. For example, to ring
FELIX dial 723515. There is only one
tieline connecting each of the
exchanges to College (see below for
if it is engaged).
• If a local extension is busy, dial an
extra 6 to the engaged tone and
replace the receiver. You will be rung
back automatically when that
extension becomes free.
• Dialling 6 also applies if the
College '72' tieline is engaged. When
you are rung back, simply dial the
remainder of the College number—
ie without the access code.
• You can distinguish incoming calls
from the length of the ring. Internal
calls within Fisher or North Side
produce a long single ring whereas
'external' calls from College produce
a short double ring. Engaged call
backs produce an even shorter single
ring.
• The special code 10 will
automatically redial the last '72'
number you dialled to College.
• Phones with recall buttons can
transfer calls and connect together
more than the normal two extensions
together. This functions in a similar

way to the main College telephone
exchange.
• Call diversion is supported, where
you can send all your calls to another
extension automatically. However
this is rather anti-social in the context
of a Hall of Residence. If calls have
been diverted from your phone
(intermittent dialling tone) dial 65 to
completely reset the line. This also
cancels any '6' callbacks.
Incidentally, all these facilities are
also available on the other two
existing Evelyn Gardens exchanges,
but on these the most useful '6'
callback facility has been disabled, for
no apparent reason.

Hi everyone! Welcome back to IC
(and for the lucky ones, exams too!).
I'm busy swotting this term, but if
you're feeling adventurous, don't
miss the Stop Clause 27/28/29
March. It's on Saturday April 30
(tomorrow), meeting at 12 noon at
Embankment tube. See you all there!
PS1. We will probably march
under the U L U banner—it's red, or
else just listen out and you'll hear me
for sure!
PS2. Thanks for all the fan mail,
especially the sweet one in last term's'
last FELIX—I was touched! (Touched
up?)

Letter from
St Mary's
I sat in the TV room feeling sicker and
sicker. My heart pounded mercilessly
against the frail cage enclosing it.
Sweat poured from the palms, making
the reflex gripping of the seat
difficult, and I had to wipe my hands
continuously. Cries of anguish could
be heard from all in the room. Some
people even crouched behind seats
and could not look. The tension was
overpowering, one could have cut the
atmosphere with a knife.
When it was all over, the pale
shattered faces stumbled out of the
room and wandered off, aimlessly in
all directions. There were mumbled
words of reassurance, but all knew
deep down in their hearts the truth that
had been starkly shown, the naked
truth that no one could now ignore.
No, this was not the latest horror
video. This was a programme
infinitely more disturbing. Doctors to
be, the Horizon series really pulled
out the stops on Sunday night,
providing a feast of exam pressure
with those who passed and failed in
disturbing close-up detail. The
anguish shown on the faces is real,
'I know because I was there'. Yes, I
failed my exams (one of four) in
summer and I opened that little brown
envelope with my typed name on it.
One of the most disturbing facts
was the number of people I failed to
recognise in the programme. It does
nothing to the confidence when you
see people just as able as you being
asked to leave the school. A couple
each year (especially after the second
year) fail to make the grade who
really did want to be doctors and spent
most of their life attempting to
achieve their ambition.
It is not the same as Biochemistry
or Physics, Electronics or Life
Science. Medicine is a vocation, there
is an undefinable element that makes
people want to be doctors. I never
decided to be a doctor, but I know
now I could be nothing else. This
makes the anguish and the failures so
much more painful. One almost wept
to see the faces of those who failed.
Maybe a good thing about this
programme is that the pressure side
of medical school is seen, and that it
isn't all fun and games. If that greater
understanding is revealed then there
has been a benefit. I do wonder
however, how many people will have
been put off medicine due to that
programme on Sunday?
