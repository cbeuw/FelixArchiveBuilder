FELIX
Rag Fete
It's Rag Fete tomorrow and as an avid
Eastenders' fan I can't wait to meet
Donna and Elizabeth (I wonder why
they couldn't get one of the hunky
men as well!). FELIX is going to have
a stall there where we will be flogging
off our t-shirts and sweatshirts and a
photographer will be going around
taking pictures of you all which you
can buy for Rag next Monday.
The best bit will be the Exam Blues
Ball that evening. It's going to be my
last chance to let my hair down before
all my staff desert me to revise.
College Finance
I spent yesterday ploughing through
the report on the organisation and
management of the College Finance
Office. I'm afraid I was not at all
surprised by the conclusions that were
reached. We all knew when the new
computing system was installed that
it had been badly thought out and the
accounting package unsuitable. No
doubt a few administrators will be
given the push, if only sideways, to
stop them from doing any more harm.
The worse thing to come out of this
whole fiasco is the bad feeling that has
built up between College and its
suppliers, some of whom have not
been paid for over six months.
College currently owes the Print Unit
in excess of £6000 for work it has
done over the last year, so I hate to
think how much the total debt is to
outside suppliers.
It will take a long time for all of us
to regain faith in the Finance Section.
Union Finance
It appears that the Snack Bar and the
Union Bar have lost money, and been
losing it for a long time. The Union
Office are tight-lipped on the subject
but concerned enough to call in the
police. I agree that it is worrying that
so much money should have gone
astray (rumoured to be between
£5,000 and £10,000, although nobody
will confirm a figure with me) but
they seem to have little regard for
their snack bar and bar staff. One of
my friends who worked casually in
the Snack Bar one night a week last
term was told that she had to see the
police and was given no reason why.
After several re-scheduled
appointments, she was told that they
no longer wanted to interview her.
Again she was given no reason.
Perhaps you think that such a loss
deserves the utmost secrecy but
they've thrown suspicion on all the
oudet staff and made them all feel like
they've done something wrong.
I do hope that they find out where
this money has gone because such a
loss affects us all as Union members
and outlet users—which takes me onto
a second point.
The portions are
getting smaller!
The Union Office have told the Snack
Bar that a portion is a spoonful of
salad. This is clearly outrageous
because last term I got two spoonfulls.
This is an effective 100% increase in
the prices. I'm now still hungry after
visiting the Snack Bar and I'm
revolting (no jokes please). I no
longer believe the Snack Bar to be
'good value' as it once used to be. The
trouble with the Union is that it's been
taken over by managers who are not
concerned with students but with
making a profit. They should be
encouraging students to use the outlets
not forcing them away because of
irregular opening hours, minute
portions and bad value for money.
I'm now taking my custom to
Waitrose.
Kebabs
I was very impressed by the quality
of the kebabs they now serve in
Southside. In fact I have been
continually impressed by the rise in
standards of the various College food
outlets since Rob Northey took over
as Refectories Manager. Again I'm
concerned about the prices.
Now for the rant...
A few years ago there was a tendency
amongst Union Officers to want to
take over failing College outlets
because they thought they could run
them better, rather than pushing
College for a better deal. I know
because I was part of that movement.
My Union heyday was picketing the
College Bars because we wanted the
Union Bar. I think, on reflection, that
we were wrong.
We now concern ourselves with our
bar and snack bar. We no longer have
the power to persuade College to
lower their prices because we're
trying to make the profit as well. The
Union has employed two new
members of permanent staff to cope
with these outlets. It no longer has
time to concern itself with the simple
things like campaigning for lock
changes in Southside, realistic prices
in the Southside Shop, a better
College careers service, lecturing
standard, etc.
The Union is becoming curiously
more and more insular rather than
opening itself up. Today's Union is
a union of secrets and publicity stunts.
I don't think that the Union has done
anything of real significance for the
average student for years. I invite
letters on the subject, especially from
Union Officers. CHL
