Report recommends reorganisation for IC Finance Section

An independent report into the running of College finance has slammed
the Finance Office for 'working in an environment of continual crisis
without adequate computer systems of sufficient experienced staff.'
The Office, which deals with all
College Research contracts and the
payment of every Imperial College
bill, has been having major problems
throughout the year, with its new
1NTAC computer system.
As reported in FELIX last term, the
Finance Section lost a great deal of
information when the computer went
down for four days. They have since
been trying to retrieve their records
and sort out the system.
The report by Management
Consultants Deloitte, Hoskins and
Sells states that there are 'serious
inadequacies' in the accounting
package which the College installed
in the Summer of 1986. It says that
the operating procedures had been
tackled by 'extensive ad-hoc in house
development' and the users had
modified the original package so
much that it placed undue reliance on
the College resources. It is no longer
possible to use the supplier's
knowledge to fix any problems that
now occur with the package.
The problems with this system have
resulted in bills going unpaid for
nearly six months and suppliers
refusing to carry on delivering to the
College.
One source told FELIX that the
Refectories Section had to send out
'runners' with manually-drawn
cheques in order to secure deliveries
each day.
The report suggests that the College
revert to a manual system for the rest
of the financial year until the
confusion has been sorted out. It also
suggests that the present computing
system should only be used for basic
accounting functions until a totally
new accounting package, more suited
to the College's needs, is installed for
the 1989/90 academic year.
One of its other recommendations
is that 'outside assistance' might be
required in order to have the end of
year accounts ready in time, which
will cost the College even more
money.
It says that the departments should
take on more of the administration
side of the finance system and
recommends that a pilot scheme on
Research Contract approval and
Order Production should be initiated.
The report indicates that this could be
done by de-centralising part of the
Finance Section: 'a complement of 80
staff appears large to operate a
computerised finance function in an
organisation of Imperial's size'. It
suggests that some of the staff could
be transferred out to departments once
the current problems have been sorted
out.
It is unknown, however, how much
the recent events have cost the
College. As well as paying for the
original accounting package and the
extensive Management Consultants
report, a great deal of staff time has
been spent trying to work the new
computer system. Academics and
administrators have also had to spend
time chasing unpaid invoices through
the Finance Section, and explaining
to suppliers about the problems.
It is also unclear as to how much
a new computer system that could
fulfil the College's requirements
would cost.
Fire in Linstead
Phew, what a scorcher!
Linstead Hall in Princes Gardens was
evacuated early on Wednesday
morning after a resident's room was
set alight.
Warren Duffin, a first year
Mathematics student, raised the alarm
when his coffee maker caughtfireand
spread to his curtains. The fire
brigade was called but the blaze had
already been put out using fire
extinguishers.
Eye witnesses told FELIX that
there was a great deal of smoke
billowing from the room.
Mr Duffin's curtains were badly
singed and his coffee maker was
destroyed. Also many of his
possessions were soaked by the fire
extinguishers.
