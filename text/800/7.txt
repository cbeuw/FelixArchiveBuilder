Cookery Club
A gastronomic
survey of the world
The summer is coming up. Many
students will no doubt travel around
Europe on Interrail, others might be
more fortunate to find themselves in
more exotic parts of the world. One
should avail this rare opportunity for
enjoying the cuisine of the host
nation, yet one is not always sure
what dishes to be on the look out for
or equally importantly where to eat.
I have negotiated with Judith a brief
to write articles that try to address
these issues.
I would like to write articles on
eating out in Spain, France, Italy,
Greece, Middle-Eastern countries,
India and the Far East. I will try and
cover the more popular student
destinations before the others.
I am relying on the international
community at Imperial College to
give me the necessary information to
be able to write suitable articles. Full
credit will be given for any
information that is used. I can be
contacted on int 4412 or 4320.1 will
be most happy to meet anyone with
useful tips at a time and place of their
choosing. I depend on YOU!!
A Summer festival
The arrival of the summer means a
significant change to the food we eat.
A sample of the things that I will be
making over the summer include a
rich strawberry mousse, chicken
tikka, and a sangria to quench the
thirst.
Chicken Tikka
This simple dish became legendary in
Holbein House when I served it at a
barbecue accompanied with freshly
made corriander chutney. The recipe
is simple.
Ingredients:
8 chicken thighs
I inch long piece of ginger root
4 cloves garlic
Juice of a whole lemon
1 tsp red chilli
1 tsp ground corriander
'A tsp tummeric
1 tsp ground cummin
'A tsp freshly ground pepper
]
A tsp salt
4 heaped tablespoons of whole milk
yogurt
I tsp 'garram masala'
(Garram masala can be purched at all
Indian grocers. It is made by grinding
equal parts of black pepper, cummin
cinnamon, cloves and black
cardommom pods. A little of this
fragrant powder can be sprinkled over
any Indian dish a minute before
serving to impart it with a great
aroma.)
Method:
1. Remove the skin from the thighs,
and cut the pieces into two.
2. Prepare the marinade by finely
chopping the garlic and the ginger,
then blend it with the rest of the
ingredients.
3. Add the chicken pieces to the
marinade and refrigerate the mixture
overnight.
4. Cook the chicken pieces under the
grill on high heat until they begin to
lightly brown. You might like to add
a little of the marinade that is left over
the chicken. Continue cooking on low
heat until well cooked, basting with
a little oil as the cooking proceeds.
Sangria
1 was told how to make this regal
concoction by Maria Issabella from
Bilbao. She tells me that she makes
a heavy duty sangria by adding
Cointreau and other goodies to the
standard recipe. Unless you want to
get stone drunk over the summer I
would stick to the recipe below.
Ingredients (for ten people):
4 litres ordinary red wine
2.5 litre orange juice
4 oranges
2 lemons
2 bananas
2 peaches
1 large cinnamon stick
Sugar
Method:
1. Chop the fruits into chunks.
2. Add all the red wine to the fruits,
the cinnamon. Add sugar to taste
3. Cover and leave to lie outside for
6 hours.
4. Add the orange juice to the mixture
and refrigerate overnight. Drink it the
next afternoon. I recommend that you
then sit back to watch the cricket on
the box.
The summer festival will continue in
next week's FELIX.
Bye for now,
Yishu Nanda,
Head Chef, FELIX.

I A ROOM WITH
A VIEW
ICU Honorary Secretary
Chas Jackson
Chas Jackson, Imperial College
Union's Honorary Secretary was born
in Todmorden, West Yorkshire in
1964. He admits to having enjoyed his
school days although he says that he
had a fairly traumatic childhood. He
came to Imperial in 1982 to study for
a degree in Chemical Engineering,
which he finally obtained last year.
During his six years at Imperial, he
has lived in a wide range of College
accommodation and is presently
occupying a single room on the
notthside of Falmouth-Keogh Hall in
the Southside Halls of Residence.
His first year was spent sharing a
room with two other students in
Mining House, one of the Evelyn
Gardens houses. He became very
active in the House and was selected
as a re-applicant for his second year.
For the next few years he lived in
several flats in both Hamlet Gardens
and Lexham Gardens.
He prefers living in the flats to halls
or houses because he likes a kitchen
to himself rather than having to share
it with eighty other residents. When
he does cook in Southside, which is
about three times a week, he takes
over the kitchens later on in the
evening to avoid the peak times when
twenty students are trying to cook on
two cookers. He says that has no
regrets about not having lived in
Southside during his first year
because it is much more impersonal
that Mining House was.
Chas' room not only contains the
usual bed, desk, chair and sink but
also a fridge, a stereo, and half a
bicycle propped up against the wall.
He says that the room is just
beginning to reflect his personality
after eight months. "It's very difficult
to do anything with a Southside
room", he claims. His major problem
was trying to erase the personality of
its last occupant. "I used to spend a
lot of time in this room when Gutman
(last year's Honorary Secretary) lived
in it. I found it a bit hard getting used
to the idea that it was now my room
and not his."
His favourite possession is his pre-
amp, an impressive instrument with
a built-in oscilloscope that shows the
waveforms of the music while it's
playing. "It helps to impress the
girlies", he jokes. He prefers
listening to his large record collection
when he got time to relax rather than
sitting and watching the television on
gallery level like most Falmouth-
Keogh residents.
Chas has a surprising amount of
books on his shelves, most of which
are science fiction or Chem Eng text
books. His book collection and all his
other possessions get more and more
every year. He had to use a transit to
move into his latest room even though
he had junked quite a lot of stuff
beforehand.
I asked him what his future plans
were after he leaves Imperial?
"To earn enough money to run a
car", he says.
