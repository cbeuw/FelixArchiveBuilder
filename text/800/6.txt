Editorial:
Who gets
educated?
A recent study of science ability in
final year schoolchildren (See Nature
332 pi 95) suggested that the British
are nearly the best in the world at
teaching science. This seems to imply
that our future as a high-tech economy
is assured since our major competitors
have children who came out of the
tests with poor results. Don't believe
a word of it.
The study involved standard tests
on the basic concepts of Physics,
Biology and Chemistry that were
taken by 44,000 school children in
their last year of schooling. All the
children were doing science courses.
Britain and Hong Kong come near top
in all areas, Japan's children are
middling and Americans appear to be
morons. These appearances can be
deceptive and our results actually
obscure major holes in our
educational system.
The major differences are that here
only 20% of the population are still
in school at the age range of the tests
and those people are specialists. It is
not surprising that they do well in the
tests. In both the USA and Japan most
people are still at school at the age,
so, although their actual performance
may be worse overall, far more
people have some grasp of what the
sciences are about. In Britain the
people not doing the tests are likely
to be utterly ignorant of the subjects
involved.
Our education system is therefore
widely regarded as producing better
experts than anyone else, but the
experts are too narrow minded on one
hand and our general population is
woefully ignorant on the other.
Neither of these facts is likely to
prove conducive to our national
success in the long term.
If we want to build a productive
high-tech future then we need a
population that is educated enough to
do our scientific and technical jobs.
It is not enough to have a small band
of experts to do all the technological
dirty-work: the whole of the
population must be well enough
grounded in the basics of science to
understand what is going on. One of
the reasons why Britain's workers are
less efficient than their competitors
abroad is because they are more
stupid. Once they have left school (as
likely as not with no qualifications)
they never again set foot in an
educational establishment. They don't
know enough to understand the
workings of the machines they
operate and therefore they are never
able to suggest improvements to
them. Their lack of training also
makes them less versatile and this
prevents easy switching from one job
to another. Instead of encouraging
retraining, unions have often stood
firm against changes in working
practice fossilising their members
discovery if it was dangled in front
of their nose.
British universities pride
themselves on knowledge for the sake
of knowledge. There is nothing
inherently wrong with that except that
it costs money that might be better
spent elsewhere. As it is, our whole
eduction system has been distorted to
keep the universities supplied with
experts. The cost has been a poorer
economy and a general population
wallowing in glorious ignorance. We
cannot and must not let in continue.

lack of versatility.
But there are other reasons for
wanting a well educated populace. If
all the science is done by a small
group of experts and nobody else
understands what they are doing, the
majority can easily become suspicious
and distrustful of what is going on in
their name. This' is already
happening. Many areas of science are
mistrusted by the public because no
one has taken the effort to explain
what is going on and why.
Some of the public mistrust may be
justified. Our education for specialists
often produces the sort of dedicated
expert who knows and cares about
nothing outside his own field. Such
experts have no real sense of public
purpose. Even if they did have they
wouldn't be able to communicate it
to the public. We don't, however,
need more applied research (or we
might do, but that's another issue), we
just need experts with a sense of their
role in society. We need people who
appreciate the use or possible use of
their work. We need people who
know what society needs and who are
prepared to keep an eye open for
science that might be useful. As it is
we have a load of superbly trained
experts who couldn't spot a useful
Historically the British school
system has been based around the
training of elites (like those who want
to go to university) and it has become
very good at it. But we have tended
to neglect the rest. But, it is
impossible to build a successful
society out of Sun readers.
If the universities are to survive
then they must convince the rest of
society that they do something useful.
They are hardly going to succeed at
this if they hang on to their elitist
traditions. If science is to survive in
this country then we have to explain
to the people; we have to tell them
what we are doing in a way that they
can understand. Then perhaps we will
get the money to keep the universities
in a healthy state.
Fermat's Phoenix
One of the most intriguing of the
unsolved problems in mathematics
was very nearly solved recently, but
it staged a last minute recovery.
Fermat's last theorem has been the
subject of more attempted proofs than
any other theorem, probably because
of its intriguing simplicity. The
theorem states that the equation
X n
= Y n
+ Z " has no whole number
solutions when n is greater than 2.
Fermat, a 17th century French
mathematician, had a bad habit of
leaving theorems lying around
without proofs. By the end of the 18th
century other scholars had solved
them all except this simple one which
therefore became known as Fermat's
last.
Because of the simplicity of the
equation many non-experts have
attempted spurious proofs thereof, but
these have usually proved to be
complete and utter rubbish. Experts
in many branches of mathematics
have also been attempting proofs ever
since the theorem was published, but
these have been hardly any more
successful. This has led to a
considerable degree of caution among
those who think they might have
cracked it. The biggest breakthrough
ever occurred a few years ago when
some pretty weird results were
applied in a new way to show that the
theorem had only a finite number of
solutions. The latest attempt at a
complete proof was by a Japanese
mathematician, Yoichi Miyaoka, who
was so cautious that he didn't mention
Fermat's theorem by name in the
whole of the presentation of his
results.
The supposed proof involved some
very esoteric theorem-juggling
between different areas of
mathematics and was so complicated
that probably only five or so other
people in the world were capable of
understanding it. It involved some
translations of problems about
numbers into questions about
geometry and topology where some
useful and powerful theorems exist
that can (and have) solved very
difficult problems in number theory
before.
Unfortunately, one of the people
who is checking the work has recently
said that there is a balls-up in it.
Somewhere in the translation process
from numbers to topology, Miyaoka
used a dodgy theorem. Now it may
be that a suitable correct theorem
exists, but he had assumed that
another theorem would be generally
applicable when it wasn't. More work
is said to be needed.
On the other hand this is widely
regarded as the best attempt at a proof
for years and has broken new ground
in translating numerical problems into
other problems that can be more
easily sorted out. So although this
particular proof may be wrong (and
we have to wait until the correction
has been thoroughly checked) they
may at last be going in the right
direction.
