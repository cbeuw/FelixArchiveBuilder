Wail Street (15)
It is unfortunate in a sense that
Michael Douglas has received so
much hype for his role in Fatal
Attraction and little, in Britain at least,
for his magnificent part in Wall Street.
Winning an Oscar is not easy,
especially against such talents as
William Hurt and Robin Williams,
but I can say for certain that Douglas
deserves it fully for bringing the
character Gordon Gekko truly to life.
Gekko is a corporate raider, has the
sole occupation of obtaining what he
wants—usually money—when he
wants, and using it in any way
necessary to bring more capital gains.
His office furniture alone could testify
to his income, and we needn't even
look at his art collection or beach
home for further proof. From his first
appearance, right up to his final one,
Douglas makes it clear that no one
and nothing is more important than
being wealthy and a part of that one
per cent of American people who own
half of the country's riches.
Balance this with Charlie Sheen, a
young broker who wants in on the
faster world of higher finance, but not
at any price. With the totally ruthless
Gekko as teacher, however, anyone
can go astray, and the character of
Bud Fox, once again made believable
by superb acting, quickly does. We
follow Fox's induction into the nasty
world of money, and we are
accompanied by Carl Fox watching
also, and forced to bear witness to the
fast rise and inevitable fall of his son.
The scenes with Charlie Sheen
opposite his father Martin are a
delight to see and add further realism
to this movie.
You have to be good to get to the
top, and Bud Fox is. To stay there
takes something more, complete
disregard for everybody except
yourself, and only Gekko has that in
this film. Fox is on his way out
quickly, but if the good guys must go
down, they always go down fighting.
Revenge is sweet, and Fox does get
a small taste.
Don't be fooled, there isn't a happy
ending. Oliver Stone (director of
Platoon and Midnight Express) does
not provide a heart-warming couple
of hours of entertainment. Rather he
gives us a lesson. Not that walking
over people is bad—Gekko is doing
quite well. Nor does he say that you
can do well if you're willing to take
on Gekko and his rivals. Bud Fox
doesn't.
The lesson is that to play with the
big boys you have to be one of them.
If you're not then it's only a matter
of time before you get your fingers
burned. The big boys live by one rule:
'Bucks is everything,' Douglas tells
us, 'the rest is conversation'. If you
don't play by the rules, you don't
play.
I couldn't help being reminded of
The Hitcher while watching Wall
Street. Rutger Hauer takes a full two
hours to corrupt his innocent protege,
while Michael Douglas does it in just
thirty minutes. The dealing shown is
also reminiscent of the showdown in
Trading Places, but Wall Street has
no Eddie Murphy, no laughs, and no
runners up.
The most striking quality of this
film is its realism, provided partly by
a wonderful cast, and aided
immensely by the New York
backdrop, ever present and always
impressive. The business world
exists, and no doubt there is a Gordon
Gekko, or many, somewhere.
Michael Douglas convinced me of
that. In Fatal Attraction he proved
that he is a star. In Wall Street he
shows just what an enormously
talented star he is.
See this film. I can guarantee you'll
enjoy it. Wall Street opens tonight at
the Odeon, Leicester Square.

The Princess Bride (PG)
I suspect very few people over the age
of ten would be attracted by the
advertising for this film. After all, that
tends to be the audience that fairy-
tales are aimed at. The release during
Easter indicates that perhaps the
distributors and film makers consider
this to be a children's film. But I
would disagree.
Based on a book by William
Goldman, (Marathon Man, Magic),
it tells the story of the true love
between a simple farm boy, Westley,
(Cary Elves) who is in fact as much
of a hero as Indiana Jones, and
Buttercup (Robin Wright in her first
film role). They suffer from none of
the problems of modern day true
love—safe sex, mortgages and what
to put in the children's packed
lunches—but every conceivable
misfortune of medieval times.
Torture, kidnapping, a good deal of
innocent violence and even a giant
rodent of which James Herbert would
be proud.
The baddies get their rightful
punishment, the goodies get their
various revenges, and in the end true
love wins, as we were promised all
along. It still sounds like a Disney
cartoon doesn't it?
The adult element comes in the
highly satirical humour, predominant
throughout, and often very subtle.
'You just made one of the two
classical major blunders' laughs the
evil mercenary Vizzini, who has
switched poisoned drinks while the
hero's back is turned, 'The other is
to start a land-based war in Asia.' The
effect is reminiscent of Time Bandits
with a simpler story. Nothing
complicated to distract you from the
fun.
The cast are good, and special
performances by Peter Falk, Mel
Smith, Peter Cook and Billy Crystal
as the wizard Miracle Max, with
Jewish accent and made-up like Yoda,
add a small touch of class.
This is a pleasant film, enjoyable
to watch, and made jfith tongue
firmly in cheek. Above all it is nice
to see another low budget British film
appearing to challenge the big bucks
Hollywood productions being
incessantly thrown at us. The Princess
Bride not only fares well against
them, for entertainment value it beats
many of them hands down.
