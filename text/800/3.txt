Union makes money
from waste
Following a motion passed by a
Union General Meeting last term, the
Union is now collecting waste paper
from all over College which it is
hoping to sell to recycling companies.
ICU President Sydney Harbour-
Bridge wants the revenue to benefit
students. T'd like to see the money
used to subsidise paper sales in the
bookshop so that everyone benefits',
he told FELIX.
Steve Easterbrook, a Computing
postgraduate, is coordinating the
scheme. He has asked people to pre-
sort any paper into three categories:
newspapers, computer paper, and
other miscellaneous paper, which he
will then arrange to be collected.
Meanwhile Westminster City
Council have agreed to install bottle
banks in College, probably outside
each College bar.
If anybody is interested in helping
with the scheme, they are asked to
contact either Steve or Sydney on int
3500.

Students better off
according to DES
Students income has risen by 5 % in
real terms since 1983, according to
a survey conducted on behalf of the
Department of Education. While
grants and awards have fallen in value
by 21%, parental contributions
increased by 86% (£480) on average.
However, a large part of the increase
in income may be accounted for by
the value of covenanted tax rebates
which are estimated to have risen an
average from £65 to £211 and which
have been phased out in the last
budget. Also withdrawals from
savings accounted for 3.5% of the
total resources used by the average
student, and the surveyed students
expected an overdraft with a mean
value of £ 3 4 1 (described as
unreasonable by the Minist-y for
Higher Education) at the end of the
academic year. The report revealed
that spending on entertainment,
alcohol and tobacco had risen by 48%
since the 1983 survey conducted for
the National Union of Students. There
had been an 11 % fall in spending on
books and equipment.
Health education
The College Health Centre is running
a College-wide health education
programme throughout this term.
There will be videos and practical
demonstrations on a number of
health-related subjects. Each session
will be from 1,05pm to 1.50pm every
Tuesday in the Health Centre, 14
Princes Gardens, and all students are
invited to attend:
May 3 Cardiac Pulmonary
Resuscitation. Introduced
by Dr Alan Swann.
May 10 Breast Examination and
Cervical Smears (women
only). Introduced by Dr
Irene Weinreb.
May 17 Travelling Abroad.
Introduced by Dr Tessa
Addenbrooke.
May 24 Food for a Healthy Life.

New 'centre of
excellence' planned
An Interdisciplinary Research Centre,
to develop materials for future
generations of computer chips, is to
be set up at Imperial College. Plans
for the centre are expected to be
approved by the Science and
Engineering Research Council at a
meeting on June 15. The Research
Council and the University Grants
Committee are to provide funds of £8
million, while Imperial hopes to win
another £2 million from the Ministry
of Defence. Industrial investment is
to be sought, and at least 20% of the
activities of the centre should be
industrial contracts.
The centre at Imperial will work on
ways of growing ultra-thin layers of
the materials used in making
electronic chips (which include very
pure silicon, gallium arsenide layered
over silicon, and alloys of silicon with
germanium) and on simulating how
the materials will react when made
into devices. Skills in areas such as
physics, chemistry, materials and
engineering will be brought together,
and about forty research and technical
staff will be employed, under the
control of a director from industry.
The centre is due to start operations
on January 1 1989.
The Interdisciplinary Research
Centre is part of the official
Government strategy to develop
national centres of excellence in
important areas of technology, linked
to universities. Other such centres
include a superconductivity centre at
Cambridge, and molecular sciences
centre at Oxford, a surface sciences
centre at Liverpool and an
engineering design centre in
Glasgow.
Competition
Winners-FELIX
Office deluged!
What a surprise! A large number of
people actually sent in entries for last
term's word search. The lengths some
of them went to in order to make them
easily read were considerable—maybe
we should have given marks for
artistic impression. As it was, the
Editor picked, blind, a completely
random entry (it's all her fault). The
lucky winner was: M Kakhi, 1 M E D
(translate that as you will).
Pick up your prize sweatshirt at the
