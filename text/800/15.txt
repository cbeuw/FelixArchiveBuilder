OOTBALL
by

Grainger-
The end of the season is nigh with
points at this stage vital for those
teams pushing for promotion or
pulling away from the dire disasters
of relegation. There are two sets of
fixtures as it is Bank Holiday
weekend. Check press for KO times.
Saturday 30th April
Chelsea vs Liverpool
Stamford Bridge (Fulham Bdy tube)
Chelsea are desperate for points in
their fight against the play-off
position, but a game against the newly
crowned league champions wouldn't
really be their ideal choice of game.
Two goals late on against Cup
finalists (my start of season
prediction) Wimbledon gave the
Blues a vital point last week but they
won't be expecting that sort of charity
from Barnes, Beardsley and Co.
Liverpool to win. (I wish Dalglish
would learn to speak properly
though).
Crystal Palace vs Blackburn
Selhurst Park (Selhurst Park BR)
This second division tussle looks a
classic with both sides looking for top
flight football next year. Palace must
hope that the sides above them slip up
in order to make the play offs and a
game against the side one above them
is the best way of insuring that this
happens. Blackburn recruited Ossie
Ardiles and Steve Archibald to bolster
their challenge and look set to at least
share the points.
Millwall vs Stoke City
The Den (New Cross tube)
Millwall have had a great season and
head the table, looking set to make
Division One for the first time. A win
would at least guarantee a play off
place and four more points would
make the dream a reality. Stoke are
a good side and Mick Mills has a team
for the future. They will return, but
not this year. Millwall to take the
points.
Brentford vs Doncaster
Division Three game.
Leyton Orient vs Hereford
Brisbane Road (Leyton tube)
The battle for places in the Division
Four play off places could hardly be
closer or harder. Orient must win
their last three games to make sure of
their deserved place, starting off with
a victory here.
Monday 2nd May
Arsenal vs Coventry
Highbury (Arsenal tube)
This game is of new real importance
with the distant position of a place in
Europe for the Gunners being of some
I suppose. They lost a brilliant
Littlewoods Cup Final last week and
this might throw them. Coventry are
looking for top eight place for
personal pride only and might prove
tough opposition. A draw looks
possible if Arsenal are still under the
weather.
Charlton vs Tottenham
Selhurst Park (Selhurst BR)
Charlton looked doomed a few
months ago but now have a lifeline
to survival and they must win this to
inject life into the battle campaign.
Crooks netted twice more against
Newcastle last week and has proved
a valuable asset this year. Spurs aren't
out of the relegation battle either yet
and losing games 39 and 40 could put
them in the play off position, so they
must salvage something too. A hard
fought score-draw is what I will
predict.
West Ham vs Chelsea
Upton Park (Upton Park tube)
This can best be described as the
typical end of season 6 pointer with
relegation a possibility for the loser,
with the added spice that the teams are
local rivals and enemies! West Ham
have thrown away their old form of
play and look a desperate side, full
of good players who won't score and
an injury list longer than the team list.
Chelsea had a bad run which put them
in this position and a point here would
suit them fine. I think that the
Hammers will take the points in a
scrappy but exciting game. (11.30am
kick off).
Wimbledon vs Sheffield Wed
Plough Lane (Wimbledon Pk tube)
I congratulate the Dons on reaching
the FA Cup final and I am sure that
they will do themselves justice on the
day. The result of this game isn't
really important but I am sure that
each side will play as good as usual.
Injuries must be avoided for the home
side, so they must be 'Wise'!
Wednesday are in-form and a draw
at QPR last week kept up their
challenge. Wimbledon to win by the
odd goal.
Fulham vs Bury
The home team
promotion only a
hope...
to win with
mathematical
Games of the weekend:
Crystal Palace vs Blackburn.
West Ham vs Chelsea.

The fanatical Italian Tifosi will make
sure that Ferrari will get a rapturous
welcome as the Formula One circus
returns to Europe for the San Marino
Grand Prix at Imola, Italy, on
Sunday.
Ferrari enter the race in their best
shape for five years and a victory for
local hero Gerhard Berger will
elevate him to the status of a god, last
occupied by the late, great, Canadian,
Gilles Villeneuve, whose career and
style Gerhard has remarkably
matched.
Niether completed the traditional
karting/Formula Ford/F3/F2 ladder
that most drivers climb but quickly
progressed from other areas of the
sport. Villeneuve was World
Snowmobile champion before moving
into F l straight from the American
Formula Atlantic.
Berger started in Motocross, then
Alfasud racing and a bit of European
F3 before leapfrogging into F l .
One of Berger's first Alfasud races
was at Imola in 1982, a support event
to Villeneuves's last Grand Prix.
Gilles was cheated of victory by
'team-mate' Didier Pironi when
cruising to an unchallenged 1-2 for
Ferrari and Gilles vowed never to
speak to Pironi again. This would
tragically prove correct, as Villeneuve
was killed in an horrific accident
thirteen days later at Zolder, Belgium,
on 8th May.
Berger admits that his favourite
dirver of all time is Villeneuve and
their styles have frequently been
compared. Perhaps the best
description I've heard is 'looking like
an accident with somewhere to take
place, but never happening'.
Like Villeneuve did, Berger should
have scored his first win on home soil
but his car faltered when he held a
commanding lead. My only regret is
that he drives Ferrari no 28, whereas
Villeneuve's old number was 27.
Berger's greatest opposition will
again be the McLaren-Hondas of
Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna and
Nigel Mansell's Williams-Judd.
The Dino-Ferrari circuit at Imola,
named after Enzo Ferarri's fighter
pilot son, is 3.1 miles with long
straights, tight corners and silly
chicanes. It is undoubtedly a
horsepower circuit which should see
the turbos well up in qualifiying but
it is also notoriously bad for fuel
consumption which will hit the turbos
in the race.
After the successful predictions in
the last column (four winners and four
second places), I'll put my head on
the block again and go for Ayrton
Senna to win, after the
disappointment of being disqualified
in the last two races, and Nigel
Mansell to be leading atmospheric.
Some of you may have seen the
excellent BBC coverage over the
holiday of the British Formula Three
and Saloon Car championships. Both
are benefitting from the increased
media attention with better sponsors
and larger grids. Both series have
races this Bank Holiday Monday
(May 2), F3 at Silverstone, Saloons
at Thruxton.
The saloon car scene is currently
dominated by the Ford Sierra RS500;
Andy Rouse, Jerry Mahoney and
Graham Goode the likely victors.
Class B will be dominated by the
BMW M3, with a well known face
in the Prodrive no 33 car. TV
personality Mike Smith proved that
he is a very serious and highly
talented driver with third place overall
in the recent Donington European
race, despite the death of his race
engineer on the way to the circuit.
Possible F3 winners include the
Finn Jyrki Jarvilelito (known as JJ
Lehto) Martin Donnelly, John Alcorn,
Roland Ratzenberger (yes, really!)
Damon Hill, son of double world
champion Graham Hill.
On the rally scene the World
Championships visits Corsica, island
of tragedy for the last two years. In
1986 the brilliant young Finn Henri
Toivonen was killed in the accident
that led to the banning of the group
B 'supercars'. Last year the co-driver
in a showroom class Peugeot lost his
life, showing that the ban was a hasty,
ill-conceived over-reaction.
Expect the Lancia's to win again
(they've won every round so far this
year) with Massimo Biasion and
Markku Alen the drivers.
Coverage of the San Marino Grand
Prix will hopefully be live on 'Sunday
Grandstand', with recorded highlights
on 'Grand Prix', both on BBC2. The
other events mentioned will be
recorded and transmitted laterâ€”keep
checking your Radio Times for
details. Next week we look at Jaguar's
preparations for Le Mans and the
Imperial College connection with
F3000.
16 Friday 29th April 1988 FELIX
