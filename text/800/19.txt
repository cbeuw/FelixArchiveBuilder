SQUASH
PG squash
championships
Last year the inaugral PG squash
championships were an outstanding
example of competitive teams squash.
The success of that tournament
prompts me to organise one again in
July this year.
I need to know how many
departments are interested in entering
teams. Please, feel free to put together
a team from your department even
though you might not be the PG rep
in your department. The format the
tournament will take depends on the
number of teams entering. It will
either be a round-robin or knock out
format. Contact me by 5.30pm Friday
May 6 if you want to enter a team.
After that teams can only be entered
at my discretion. I can be contacted
on int 4320 or 4412. I will provide
the details as they develop. One can
expect teams to be awarded extra
points for entering larger teams than
a minimum permitted size. This is to
reflect that the event is social as well
as competitive.
A trophy will be purchased because
the tournament has shown itself to be
able to be successful. It is important
that continuity be maintained into
subsequent years. I would welcome
anyone who might like to organise the
event next year to come and meet the
Captains of the present teams when
the draw of the team matches is made.
The tournament will be followed by
a party. The cost of financing the
trophy, the tournament, and the patty
will be met from funds from the
Union's Postgraduate Group.

Chem Eng PG.

Men's team wins promotion
South Thames II—0
Imperial College—3
2-15, 5-15, 8-15
'At the end of the day, Brian, it's the
silver in the cupboard that counts.'
Without slipping into Manager-ese
too much, it must be said that 'the
boys done good, Harry.' In this, the
last local competitive match of the
season, Imperial struggled to hold
back an impending attack of mass
apathy to beat South Thames College
soundly. Although technically
Varsovia can overtake IC on set
difference in their remaining matches,
Imperial are now assured of
promotion from the muddy depths of
the third division. This was a fairly
uninspiring performance which
consisted for the first two sets of one-
spike points for Imperial, and South
Thames winning a few from ricochets
off their own intermittent block.
Concentration faltered on promotion
point, and it took five attempts to
finish the job.
Looking back over this league
season, it has been a time of learning
to play consistently against weaker
opposition, not always successfully.
The difference in standard between
the opposition has been enormous,
especially between the London league
and national student competition, to
which Imperial have not always been
the most adaptable team. Against
better funded student teams with
external coaches, though, IC have
acquitted themselves very well this
last year. In a truly horrible draw in
the E V A Student Cup, Imperial
eventually took fifth position, having
lost in a very close battle against the
mighty Loughborogh. In the U A U ,
Imperial won the regional
competition, not dropping more than
six points in any set, only to lose once
more to Loughborough in the semi-
final to take fourth position. Despite
these two losses, it must be
remembered that these positions were
achieved by knocking out some of the
consistently strongest teams in student
volleyball, notably Leeds,
Cambridge, Sheffield, Newcastle,
and Bristol Universities. With losing
only two of the first team squad come
June, however, Imperial must be
looking to do even better next season,
and to finally push volleyball to the
forefront of Imperial sport.

Regular followers of the racing
column may have noticed an element
of cynicism creeping into the last one
of the Easter term. I make no
apologies for this—anyone who lost
as much as I did at the Cheltenham
Festival would have acted similarly.
Also, FELIX has received flak on
two points: firstly, that racing is the
work of the devil—'FELIX is a bad
influence on easily-led students by
encouraging them to whack their
grants on the ponies'. Secondly, that
racing is very much a minority
interest within the College.
My reply to this is quite
simply—'Bollocks'.
This week sees two classic races of
the flat season. The 1000 and 2000
Guineas. Unfortunately, the 1000
Guineas was yesterday and I'm
writing this last Tuesday. So I can't
tell you who won—what do you think
I am, psychic? The 2000 is a different
matter. There may be nine runners
but that doesn't alter the fact that it
is a one horse race. Doyoun is in no
danger here and is odds-on favourite
with all the bookies. It's certainly not
worthy of a bet and represents bad
value for money. The 2000 Guineas
this year is a race to avoid.
Saturday saw Desert Orchid score
a resounding victory in the Whitbread
Gold Cup. His win capped a perfect
month for trainer David Els worth.
Having trained National winner
Rhyme 'n' Reason, he was named on
Saturday as Piper Heidseck Trainer
of the Year.
Sharp Reminder, winner of the
Leicestershire Stakes on Saturday is
fancied for The Greenland Stakes at
the Curragh on May 14th. The four-
year-old just won by a neck from
Sharblask over the seven furlong
course. Trainer, Ray Laing, intends
to drop down a furlong for the Irish
meeting. He thinks that his selection
will run a better race over the shorter
trip as he was clearly suffering in the
last furlong at the weekend.
This weeks tips appear on the news
pages.
