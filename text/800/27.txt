continued from the front
be dismissed and the Snack Bar closed
until the position of its permanent
members of staff had been reviewed.
ICU Deputy President Alan Rose,
who has overall responsibility for the
Union's trading outlets, was not told
of Tuesday's meeting and was only
informed of the decisions that had
been made yesterday morning. Mr
Rose was said to be extremely
concerned that he had not been
present at such an important meeting
or kept informed of crucial decisions
which had been made.
The casual bar staff were informed
of their dismissal yesterday morning
on the grounds of pilfering.
Both Mr Norman Jardine, the
Snack Bar Manager, and Mr Mark
Anderson, his Deputy, were sent
letters by the President yesterday
afternoon. In them Mr Harbour-
Bridge said that they had been
suspended on full pay in view of their
'acknowledged misconduct' of their
handling of stock. When they were
told of their suspension, they were
escorted off Union premises.
Mr Harbour-Bridge told FELIX
that the Snack Bar would be closed
until the beginning of next academic
year. He is unwilling to re-open the
Snack Bar if the inquiry decides to
reinstate the permanent staff, and
there would be nobody to run the
outlet if they did lose their jobs. The
Union Bar will also be closed for the
duration of the Summer vacation. He
said that this would enable vital
refurbishment work to take place in
both outlets.
The Union Bar will be run on
skeleton staff for the rest of the term
as no more casuals are to be
employed. The present Union Bar
Manager Adrian Johnson has agreed
to stay on as Deputy Bar Manager and
a new permanent bar worker is to be
employed. Meanwhile both Mr
Harbour-Bridge and Honorary
Secretary Chas Jackson will be
helping Mr Johnson run the Bar. Mr
Jackson told FELIX that the Bar
would be working on restricted
opening times. He said that it would
not be open during weekend
lunchtimes and three nights a week.
Mr Harbour-Bridge said that he was
'very grateful to Jelly (Mr Johnson)
for being so reasonable about the
whole thing.' He added that all the
Bar locks had been changed
yesterday.
Mr Harbour-Bridge said that he
could only justify his decision on the
basis that £35,000 had been lost from
the Snack Bar and £ 6 , 0 0 0 from the
Bar. He said that he could have
sacked the staff who were suspected
of petty pilfering but if he had got the
wrong people it 'would have been far
worse' than sacking everybody.
You may have been surprised to see
a FELIX out on a Thursday rather
than a Friday. This is a special
flysheet issue to keep you up-to-date
on the events as they occur in the
Union Office, Snack Bar and Bar.
There will be a normal size FELIX
out tomorrow with more news as it
happens.
I hope that you have taken time to
read the news story. It is important
to remember that nobody has been
charged by the police for theft yet.
There are a great deal of interesting
theories flying around the Union at
the moment but none of them has been
substantiated. I hope that most of us
still believe in 'innocent until proven
guilty'.
I think that Syd and his
'investigatory committee' have acted
as they believe is best for the Union
(in the long run). They made some
tough decisions, ones which I would
not have liked to have made. It
concerns me that the justification of
his actions was purely monetary. He
does not seemed to have considered
the people involved. They have
sacked the innocent to get at the
possible guilty. They have sacked
people who have worked very hard
for the Union; who have put a great
deal of extra time and effort into their
jobs. They have split the Union into
two.
Possible theft is always a very
difficult situation, but there is no
excuse for the way that the Union staff
have been treated. One thing the
President, and the Union, must learn
is that it is important not only to be
fair, but to be seen to be so.

Dear Judith,
I write with reference to the recent
police investigation relating to the
Union Bar and Snack Bar, which
investigated losses from these outlets.
While I accept that the
circumstances prevailing could not
continue as they were, I feel that the
manner in which the investigation was
conducted was an outright insult to the
many people who have worked hard
and consistently over extended
periods of time in these outlets.
There has been a total lack of
communication between the Union
Office and the staff, and this has
created much bad feeling. For
example, this must be the first time
that staff members in any institution
have been forced to book
appointments with police officers.
None of the staff were informed by
the Union Office of the reason for
their interrogation, and so the
information we eventually managed
to glean resulted from unsubstantiated
and often ambigious rumours. This
was information that should have been
presented by right to all those
concerned, preferably in writing.
The whole charade has been
appallingly organised. Some people,
in the midst of revising for vital
exams, had their appointments with
the police retimed on several
occasions, only to have them
cancelled completely. Again, no
explanation has been forthcoming.
The final outcome appears to be a
decision to sack all the members of
Union Bar casual staff, staff who rely
heavily on money earned in the Bar
to live on. Surprisingly enough, once
again no explanation has been given.
The ex-staff are now treated as an
object of constant scrutiny and
suspicion, suspicion that is in all
cases, both unfounded and untrue.
I look forward to hearing an
explanation of these events in the near
future, though I must say this seems
unlikely.
I would also like to thank you for
the support given by FELIX in these
matters.
Name withheld by request.
Dear Judith,
Today we were told that following
the discrepancies found after
stocktaking for the period Summer—
Xmas '87 subsequent to which a brief
police investigation was carried out,
a blanket dismissal of the Union Bar
staff has been executed.
Whilst an investigation into the
losses is obviously warranted, sacking
everybody in sight is not going to
solve the mystery and only serves to
punish those members of staff who
are innocent. Many of us were not
even employed for the majority of the
period over which the loss was
incurred.
Apart from the loss of much-needed
weekly income essential to
supplement the insufficient London
grant, this also puts an unjust slur on
the characters of many honest
students. Are we likely to get a job
elsewhere in College after such
indirect libel?
Not everyone was interviewed by
the police and yet everyone was
dismissed. Is this fair treatment? It is
known that the losses accumulated
over a period of time (prior to '88
although it has been put that it still
continues)—the sum involved, about
£6000—to penalise recently employed
staff seems non-sensical.
Jelly is now the only member of
staff still working—it could not
function without him and the plan is
to employ outside temporary staff
which will cost the Union more and
implies that no IC student is
trustworthy enough to work in this
bar. We feel that this whole affair has
and still is being handled badly, and
if we cannot be reinstated then those
of us who are innocent would like our
names to be cleared along with an
apology for the off-hand manner in
which we have been treated.
We understand the Union's position
in this matter, but feel that this is not
the right course of action.
Until this is cleared up, we would
be grateful if all IC students, staff etc
would boycott the Union Bar (if only
to make Jelly's job easier!).
Yours faithfully,
Debbie Nolder, Cath Maxwell &
Jeff Lloyd
on behalf of the Union Casual and
Bar Staff.
PS. We apologise if any of the
above is factually incorrect, but no
one seems to know the truth, the
whole truth or anything remotely true!
