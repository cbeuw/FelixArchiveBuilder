ELTON JOHN in concert 24th February
No 300 11th March 1971
Did you know that Elton John, Jimi
Hendrix, Yes, Deep Purple and
Pink Floyd have played Imperial
College?
In 1949 The Ents Committee
organised 'hops' in the Union
Lounge every Saturday which
were always well-attended, to the
point of being over-crowded.
It was only in the early Seventies
that Ents could put on big name
artists such as Floyd: College
allowed the newly-opened Great
Hall to be used and they could
guarantee full gigs every time.
The bubble burst when the GLC
fire officers demanded that a
barrier be erected in the hall at
least 6 feet away from the stage.
Ents could no longer use the Great
Hall, only the Union Building, and
could no longer afford to put on
the big name bands.

Southside refectory staff admitted on Wednesday that
dish described as Saute of lamb in fact contained beef.
FELIX was alerted when a
Hindu student allergic to beef
phoned the office anonymously.
FELIX reporters then went to
Southside and ordered a portion
of'Saute of Lamb'. The dish was
served, and the waitress replied
that it was lamb when asked
repeatedly.
The meal, costing 72 pence,
was brought back to the F E L I X
Office where it was examined and
found to contain large cubes of
stewing steak in a thick beef
sauce.

of returnable loans to students and de-
mand full maintenance grants for
students irrespective of parental in-
Keith Cavanagh, who is to propose
this motion to the lunchtime Union
Meeting, considers that the present
Government is trying to provide edu-
cation " on the cheap." This thought
follows, most recently, from the move
to increase the number of students in
Training Colleges without extra ex-
penditure.
The motion springs from a sugges-
tion that loans should be introduced
in a letter from the Department of
Education and Science that found its
way to the national press in early
October. The problem its creates im-
mediately is whether it was intended
as bluff or as a feeler prior to some
definite action. However, it probably
heralds a hardening of attitude to-
wards increase in student grants.
In view of the element of doubt,
Mr. Cavanagh feeis that, like NUS,
ICU should act as though it is a
No 223 1st December 1965
The threat of student loans has been with us
for well over twenty years now. Successive
Conservative governments have tentatively
suggested them to test public opinion. In the
Sixties grants were already under fire and have
never increased as much as inflation each
year.
With the swing of public opinion to the Right
in the Eighties, it is almost a certainty that
student loans will be introduce in the Nineties.
