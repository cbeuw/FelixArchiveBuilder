FELIX, the student newspaper of Imperial College, was born eight hundred
issues ago today. Since its humble gestetnered beginnings, it has seen fifty-six
editors steer its course from the kitten, wide-eyed and blinking, to the cynical,
inquisitive full-grown cat of the nineteen eighties.
The first issue of FELIX was sold for
three old pence on 9th December
1949. Only six hundred copies were
produced as the new editorial team
were unsure as to how a newspaper
would go down at IC. It was typed,
gestetnered by the College bookstall,
and then sold around departments and
from the Union Bar. The Editor, Ted
Hughes, set the tone of the newspaper
in his editorial, which he suitably
placed first in the sheets. The aim of
FELIX was to provide a 'commentary
upon events and personalities' as a
complementary source of information
to The Phoenix, the Union's arts and
literary paper which was originally
started by H G Wells.
This first FELIX was much thinner
and events orientated than today's are
and it contained just one news story,
about raucous behaviour at a Guy
Fawkes night party. Out of its twelve
pages, three were devoted to the boat
club. The others contained
Constituent College Union reports, an
article on the Brighton Rally, a sports
review, a diary of 'what's ons', letters
and gossip.
The editorial board was delighted
by the response to the newspaper. All
six hundred copies had been sold
before 10am and some students had
been re-selling their copies for as
much as fourpence to latecomers. It
was decided that they would move the
print run up to one thousand copies
to cope with the demand. They also
agreed that FELIX would come out
fortnightly during undergraduate term
time. Having gained confidence, Ted

Hughes decided to try and introduce
more regular features into the paper.
The second issue started off a series
of 'profile' articles on leading Union
and College figures and a regular
'Drinking Man's Guide to London'
which reviews local pubs and taverns.
Ted Hughes edited the paper for the
rest of the academic year and handed
over to Clifford Hargreaves in 1950,
having built up a loyal, fortnightly
readership of one thousand students.
Cliff's first issue, FELIX no 10,
was a turning point in the paper's life
as far as its production was
concerned. It was only four pages and
the type was reduced, enabling just
as much text to be fitted in those four
No 111 25th October 1957
pages as was fitted before on twelve.
This was the first time that FELIX
was printed, giving the editorial board
the ability to reproduce photographs
as well as line drawings.
In the spring of '51 John Midgley
succeeded Clifford Hargreaves as
Editor. By then the paper was settling
down into the format it was to have
throughout the fifties: sports at the
back, news on the front, letters and
editorial to the front and a series of
opinion articles under the title of
'Viewpoint'. By its second birthday
