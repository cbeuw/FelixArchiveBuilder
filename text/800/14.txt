FELIX
THE ROLLERCOASTER RIDE OF THE UNION
In 1949 the Union was housed in a two storey building on the northside of
Beit Quadrangle and most Union Officers were more mature than today's,
having all done their army service before going to university.
It was not until 1966, when the Union Building was twice the size and
nearly one-third of the student population lived on campus, that students
started to question why the Union President was elected by a handful of
people and not everybody. Debate raged for three years until a referendum
was held. Unsurprisingly the student body wanted more say in who was their
elected representative.
During the late Sixties the Union became very much more political, as was
reflected in the FELICES of that time and the Seventies were a time of great
Union management expansion when FELIX Editor and Deputy President
became sabbatical posts.

BEFORE considering the advantages ot

Lnion by popular vote, there are three
important criticisms of the present
evolutionary method. Firstly, the Presid-
ent who is elected by a meeting of joint
Council must feel more responsible to
them than to the whole Union. This very
indirect method of election means that the
President seems far from the general body
of the Union.

GRAVEL MINERS
Money raised from (he exploita-
tion of gravel deposits under the
College's sports ground at
Harlington should be used to
improve existing sports facilities,
according to a submission to the
Finance and Executive Council.
For over two years there have
been plans to extract the gravel,
which is expected to be worth
over a million pounds to College.
Substantial deposits are alre;\. i
being mined on adjacent sites,
and the College has received
estimates of the total income and
time scale of the operation; it is
College policy to put all such
work out to tender. The original
plans in 1980 were that the
money should go towards
improving student residence, but
it has since been discovered by
Union Officers that the grounds
are held in trust by the Govern-
ing Body and that the intention
of the original agreement was
that ail money raised from their
sale should be used only to
provide further sporting facilities
for students.
No 630 3rd December 1982
Harlington gravel has been news in
FELIX throughout the Eighties. A
detailed report of what the money
should be used for was front page
news in 1982 but six years on
none of it has been spent on the
students.
The Eighties have also seen the
College keen to get their hand on
the Union Building for the
expansion of the Biology
Department and as a centre for
short courses. In 1982 College
Secretary John Smith urged the
Union to accept his proposals that
the Union facilities be placed in the
basement of Southside. The
proposals were rejected.
The College was more
successful in 1986 when, due to
a weak Union Executive, the
Bot/Zoo Common Room and Old
FELIX Office in Beit Arch were
given away to Biology because
College had given the Union
control of the Union Bar.
The Union is still in a strong
position today with a completely
new management plus the
appointment of a Finance Officer
and Union Manager.
term. There was bitter
correspondence over his alleged bias.
Eventually he was only censured at
a Union General Meeting and it was
agreed that a FELIX Business
Manager should be created who
would authorise any payments so as
to avoid any further potentially
disastrous financial years.
In 1979 FELIX was charged with
'profiteering' in its charges to Union
clubs. In a bitterly fought FELIX
Editor's election, one candidate John
Shuttleworth 'exposed' the fact that
the Editor was charging for paper
plates and labour when all FELIX had
to pay for was the paper. Shuttleworth
went on to win and take the Union to
court after he failed his summer
exams and was not considered to be
of 'good academic standing', one of
the conditions of taking up a
sabbatical post. He lost his fight.
The next controversial year was
1981 when Editor Steve Marshall also
faced a motion of No Confidence at
a U G M . There had been 'growing
dissatisfaction' with his editorship
which accusations of bias, misleading
stories and personal vendettas.
The FELIX of the Eighties has had
its share of controversies. It has been
criticised as being stodgy and boring
one minute, biased and critical the
next. In recent years' it has been
forced out of Beit Arch to a basement
in the north side of the Quadrangle
in exchange for more sophisticated
printing equipment and more space.
It has always come out on a Friday
no matter what accidents have
befallen it. It has faced the threat of
censorship by the Union. But it is still
in the strongest position it has been
for several years with an average of
twenty pages each week.
FELIX has seen eight hundred
issues come and go and since 1949 it
has remained the newspaper of
Imperial College provided by the
Union to inform, criticise and
entertain the students of Imperial.
The FELIX spirit
