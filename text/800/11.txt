it had yet another Editor, S H
Wearne, who had managed to bring
the circulation up to thirteen hundred
copies and still keep the price at three
pence.
Five years after FELIX had started
its life, money was beginning to get
a bit tight. The Editor was reluctant
to increase the cover price but funds
raised by the FELIX Annual Hop

were no longer enough to keep the
paper solvent. It was decided that
FELIX should start accepting
advertisements from local traders and
banks eager to attract student custom.
The revenue wasn't a great deal but
it enabled the price to stay at three
pence until 1957.
It was at this time that the new
Union Building was completed and a
FELIX Office was placed on its third
floor. A member of the Editorial
Board inhabited this office between
lpm and 2pm every weekday in order
to receive news and articles. This
room was also used by the production
team to paste the paper up every other

Sunday. The FELIX staff seemed
quite happy with their new room
because it overlooked Queen
Alexandra House, whose inhabitants
were notorious for leaving their
curtains open when undressing!
The FELIX news pages were
dominated by stories of the proposed
demolition of the Imperial Institute to
allow a new, sprawling 'island'
complex to be built. The College also
announced its plans to develop the
Princes Gardens site for new Halls of
Residence and a sports centre.
FELIX was still being published
fortnightly by very primitive printing
methods by 1959. It was at this time
of massive College expansion plans
that the Union, staff and students
began to express doubts about the way
FELIX was produced. Several other
London colleges had started up their
own newspapers which were heavily
subsidised by their unions and of a
much higher quality than that of
FELIX. It still cost 3d but was only
making a profit of £ 2 each year. It
was at this time that the FELIX staff
faced the decision of whether to
increase the price and the quality of
the publication. There were also calls
that FELIX should go weekly. These
were rejected for two reasons: it was
not possible for a student to get a
degree and produce a newspaper each
week, and they felt that College
wasn't generating enough 'hot' news
to fill a newspaper each week.
FELIX entered the Sixties guarded
and cautious about its future. The staff
realised that if FELIX was to compete
with the College's broadsheets it
would have to be printed on better
quality paper, raise more advertising
and charge 4d for each copy. There
was still the inconvenience of having
to send the artwork up to Lancashire
for printing which wasted two days
and made sure that most news was out
of date by the time FELIX was
published. Successive editors brought
out news supplements in gestetnered
form which were inserted into each
copy before distribution to try to keep
the paper 'fresh'. Throughout the
decade they were hampered by
unreliable printers who could not
meet deadlines or could only print
illegibly.
By 1967 new printers had been
found which ensured FELIX always
came out every other Friday. This
necessitated FELIX moving up to
tabloid size from its usual A4 format.
FELICES of the late Sixties were
far more political than they are now.
They featured news of Vietnam,

demos and police raids. The home-
generated news was that of inquorate
Union General Meetings, bitter
Council arguments and a desire to
encourage more women to come to
IC, whilst denying them entry to the
Union Bar.
Inflation was soaring in 1969 which
meant that FELIX had to raise its
cover charge to 6d. Again it found
itself being criticised as a waste of
money and trees. Some important
decisions had to be taken by the
Editorial Board and the Union about
Why FELIX?
Everybody's heard of FELIX the cat. So why was the newspaper called after
this American cartoon character? The truth of the matter is that nobody is really
altogether sure why Ted Hughes, the first editor, decided on the name. FELIX
was actually suggested by F C Ewells which is well-reported in the first issue
but at no point does it say why everybody thought the name was an apt one.
The most likely theory is that it was a bastardised version of Phoenix, which
was a literary magazine produced by the Union twice a year and was the only
Union publication up until that point. It is easy to see why a cartoon character's
name should seem to fit so well when its brother publication is the high and
haughty Phoenix, rising periodically from the ashes. The cat signified a sense
of fun, entertainment, humour on one hand and on the other strength, conviction
and curiosity.

I was the screw of the year as

says Jim.
Then changed
his attitude to sex and he
became a 'maute male, with
plenty of kinky sex habits'.
Up till then Jim had had
straight sex'. but now
started dabbling in group sex.
The rest of the article is a
rather graphic portrayal of 1
Jim's first group sex experience
at Romford, Essex, wnh two
bisexual girls — one an ex-
girlfriend who also goes to IC.
'Well that yas horny Jim
...students are sexy', says
Miss Miiiington at the end.
