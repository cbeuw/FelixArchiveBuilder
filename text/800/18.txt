MUSIC-
'Waiting for Bonaparte'-
The Men They Couldn't Hang
When The Men They Couldn't Hang
released their second album—How
Green is the Valley, they produced
one of the best LPs I've heard. It was
difficult to imagine how they could
possibly follow it. With Waiting for
Bonaparte they haven't disappointed.
How Green is the Valley was a fiery
collection of music designed to bring
to the boil an angry rebellious side in
all but the most passive listener. The
latest album heralds a new era for The
Men They Couldn't Hang. Gone are
the political anthems of their previous
two albums. Instead deeper lyrics
concentrate on more subtle issues,
notably on a nautical theme.
Amongst the fast-moving tales of
smuggling, legacies and marine life
is the obligatory slow ballad—now a
trademark of TMTCH's albums.
Island in the Rain takes off where
Scarlet Ribbons and Parted From You
have previously. A memory of lost
love ghosting on an empty beach, this
is a song that will strike a chord with
anyone who longs for the past and
what might have been.
A review of this album would be
incomplete without mentioning the
new single. The Colours is quite
simply a masterpiece—the last speech
of a convicted mutineer on the
scaffold. He gives an alternative
definition of the Union flag:
'Red is the colour of the new
republic,
Blue is the colour of the sea,
White is the colour of my
innocence,
No surrender to your mercy'
Included with initial copies of the
album is a song book containing
music and lyrics of a selection of
songs from all three albums.
If you only buy one album this
year, make sure it is Waiting for
Bonaparte—you won't be
disappointed.

Ghostdance
After hearing their first compilation
album, and looking at the audience
.queueing outside, I expected
Ghostdance to be a hardcore goth
outfit. Then, when they emerged,
there wasn't a piece of black clothing
to be seen on the band. They also had
a very 'pop' sound, and with their
vocalist's incredible voice, I wouldn't
be surprised to see them getting near
the top 40.

British films are often delightfully
funny and almost always sadly
realistic. 'Wish You Were Here' is
certainly no exception. What else
could you expect from David Leland,
the director of 'Mona Lisa"?
Set in a small seaside town in post-
war Britain, and loosely based on the
early life of Cynthia Payne, the film
follows the transformation of 15 year
old Linda (Emily Lloyd) from
innocent adolescent to not-at-all
innocent and very pregnant
adolescent.
It's good fun, and provides
extremely pleasant entertainment.
This is one of that rare breed of film,
a box office smash which is just as
good when tranferred to television.

Yeah, I know, so it's summer and that
means exams and that means revision
but come on, when has that really
made any difference? I mean, there
are priorities! Take the Soup
Dragons. Now, admittedly I'd always
thought they were pretty lacking when
it came to sparkle, but when I saw
them live they were actually quite
good. But not good enough to deserve
all the acclaim heaped on them by the
music press last .year. Their best
music always fell just short of
exciting, but a miss is as good as a
mile, or so I'm told. Good as a
support band but really just another
guitar group. They're on at the Town
and Country Club tonight.
Now the Jesus and Mary Chain.
They really can deliver the goods and
tonight they're playing an 'intimate'
gig at U L U , which basically means
if you go to the bar you'll miss half
the show. But I always thought that
the Chain went down better in the
atmosphere of a smaller venue, so
don't be put off. They're promoting
their compilation of b-sides and out-
takes, 'Barbed Wire Kisses', released
last week. Moody, yes. Blunt,
definitely; but this can really never
disguise what it basically is: a
collection of near-misses, not-quites.
Put it this way; 'Sidewalking' is the
best thing on it, and the only other
moments of consequence are 'Kill
Surf City' and 'Surfin' USA'. And,
at a pinch, 'Happy Place'.
Sunday sees the return of Throwing
Muses to the Town and Country Club.
An extraordinary blend of psychedelia
and folk tinged with just about every
other musical style you can think of.
Supported by the equally good Pixies.
Last time, these two bands together
produced a gig which was heralded
as the best of the year, and among the
audience were many people of note
from the world of music. Expect the
same again!
Album Review:
'Lovely'—The Primitives
This classic album opens with the
version of 'Crash' which stormed the
charts last term. A surprise for those
of us who expected to hear the 1986
version which sounded like Jesus and
Mary Chain would have had Debbie
Harry sung for them. None the less,
a pleasant surprise, for this was pop
music at its best. The rest of the album
was as expected. More Mary Chain-
esque sounds with 'Spacehead',
'Nothing Left', 'Stop Killing Me' and
'Buzz Buzz Buzz'. While 'Carry Me
Home' is pure Monkees, 'Shadow' is
straight from '67 and 'Thru the
Flowers' and 'Ocean Blue' approach
All About Eve. 'Dreamwalk Baby',
'Run Baby Run', 'Don't Want
Anything to Change', 'I'll Stick With
You' and 'Out of Reach' represent the
sound I expect The Primitives will be
sticking to from now on, in the same
| groove as 'Crash'. My only complaint
is the absence of 'Really Stupid'
which is brilliant, but luckily this is
on the b-side of the latest single, 'Out
of Reach'. To summarise? This is
what pop music should be all about.
