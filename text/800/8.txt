Features
Tomorrow's Rag Fete is,
as usual, going to be the
event of the year
for anyone with
a slightly off
beat sense of
humour.
Eastenders fans
can also thrill to
guest
appearances by
Matilda Ziegler
(Donna) and
Lucy Bayler
(Elizabeth) who
launch the event
on the Queen's
Lawn at
2.30pm.
Although people with an aversion to
soap operas are strongly advised to
miss the opening, the rest of the day
promises something for everyone.
Keep fit by running up and down the
Queen's Tower, eat a Chaps curry,
pelt Union notables with wet sponges,
buy lots of very old Rag Mags... .what
tremendous fun for all the family,
especially for those of a more
barbarian nature. If you really want
to get vindictive you can hire QTSoc
to attack a friend. Preferably one you
don't mind losing.
A little light entertainment will be
provided by a display team from the
Bomb Disposal Squad, who should
also be equipped to deal with the
explosions from the balloon throwing
stall. Science fiction videos will
abound, courtesy of Rag Fete
organiser and ex-SFSoc chairbeing
Dave Clements.
Turning one's attenion to more
practical matters, non-veggies may be
glad to discover the burger and pig
roast stalls, as well as the inimitable
Chaps Curry emporium. There will
also be a bar until five o'clock.
Gamblers will rejoice at the larger
number of ways to try their luck and
win mind-boggling prizes. Rag
proudly presents the tombola, the
human fruit machine(!) and, of
course, the Rag Raffle. Tickets for the
raffle can be bought at the Fete or
from an itinerant Rag Rep; the first
prize is a weekend in Paris. The draw
will take place sometime during the
afternoon, as will the presentation of
last year's Rag money.
The grand finale of Rag Fete is that
great British institution, mud
wrestling. Organised by Fiona
Nicholas, RCSUVP/Rag Chair
elect/Ladies' Rugby Team supremo,
it promises to be fairly messy. No
doubt lots of well known
exhibitionists will participate purely
for the beautifying effect of mud, but
there should be some scope for taking
embarrassing photographs.
After everyone has removed mud
from their hair, clothes and other
places, there will be a big party in the
Union Building, run by ICU Ents
until the small hours.
Meanwhile, Raggies will gather
somewhere in the Queen's Tower at
6.30pm for the Rag A G M . As well
