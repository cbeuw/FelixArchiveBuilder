as electing next year's Rag officers,
the year's charities will be chosen.
Anyone with ideas about these is

The
Exam Blues
Ball
Tomorrow, ICU Entertainments are
presenting their last carnival this
academic year in association with IC
Rag. There is an amazing live double
bill in the Union Building, and cheap
booze in the Union Bar, aimed at
making Rag Fete 88 Day an effective
antidote to those Exam Blues.
Playing live is the legendary Geno
Washington and the brilliant Rent
Party along with videos all night,
disco, cocktails and a late, late bar.
Geno Washington, a former
American GI, was a huge draw on the
mid-sixties R&B circuit, touring
Britain and enjoying major album
success, this influence on the soul
scene was shown by Dexy's Midnight
Runners' tribute to him with their
1979 number one 'Geno'.
It promises to be a great night. The
doors open at 8.30pm and tickets are
available from Norman's Snack Bar
in the Union or the Union Office,
priced at a mere £ 2 . 5 0 (£3 on the
door, £ 2 for Ents cards holders).
Finally 50% of all proceeds go
straight to Rag, so you can free
yourself from revision for a good
cause!
