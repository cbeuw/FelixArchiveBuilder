Democracy Vs Petrodollar$
It has been another bad week in
Iraq. On Saturday 25 US troops
were killed. On Monday, according
to the BBC, more than 130 Iraqi peo-
ple died in Baghdad and Baquba, in
one of the car-bomb attacks we are
getting so used to hearing about.
As disaster on a scale we in Lon-
don cannot even imagine continues
to unfold, our dear leaders in Lon-
don and Washington continue deny
reality. As a civil war engulfs Iraq,
in which our troops are but one of
many sides, all the opinion polls
show a majority of Iraqis want the
US/UK troops to withdraw.
However, in this article, I want to
address the main ‘conspiracy the-
ory’ about oil. In 2003, when Blair
was selling the Iraq war to parlia-
ment, as well as something about
45 minutes, he also said “the oil rev-
enues, which people falsely claim
that we want to seize, should be put
in a trust fund for the Iraqi people
administered through the UN.”
Earlier this month The Independ-
ent reported on a new Iraqi oil law.
“Iraq’s massive oil reserves, the
third-largest in the world, are about
to be thrown open for large-scale ex-
ploitation by Western oil companies
under a controversial law which is
expected to come before the Iraqi
parliament within days… It would
give big oil companies such as BP
,
Shell and Exxon 30-year contracts
to extract Iraqi crude and allow the
first large-scale operation of foreign
oil interests in the country since the
industry was nationalised in 1972.”
Kamil Mahdi, an Iraqi academic
and senior lecturer in Middle East
economics at the University of Ex-
eter, is critical of these develop-
ments, writing in the Guardian “A
government that is failing to pro-
tect the lives of its citizens must
not embark on controversial legis-
lation that ties the hands of future
Iraqi leaders, and which threatens
to squander the Iraqis’ precious,
exhaustible resource in an orgy of
waste, corruption and theft… This
state of affairs has negative results
for all except those who are corrupt
and unscrupulous, and the vora-
cious foreign oil corporations.” In
other words, the Iraqi people are
demanding sovereignty over their
most important economic resource,
which accounts for 95% of the Iraqi
economy. Since no WMD were
found, we learned that we are in
fact on a democratising mission in
Iraq. Therefore, wouldn’t it be only
Policy of multiculturalism officially ditched
One of the many buzzwords associ-
ated with New Labour’s ‘Blairism’
has been multiculturalism. But like
with many other policy threads,
multiculturalism now appears to
have gone out of fashion.
This hands-off approach has come
about for many reasons, but has un-
doubtedly followed the rightwards
political shift of the current govern-
ment. In recent policy speeches,
Tony Blair has swept aside the
nuances of cultural interaction
and has adopted a rather more di-
rect approach to Britishness, in
effect rebuking some for holding
on to certain cultural values. Most
of these values however pose no
threat to civilised society and as
one may expect, have been passed
down the generational ladder. As a
result, current governmental policy
has not only caused significant dis-
comfort amongst immigrant popu-
lations, but has also made second
and subsequent generations feel
guilty for their beliefs.
Whilst the task of defining British-
ness rumbles on in many conversa-
tions, whether in the public house
or the upper echelons of the Home
Office, there are a number of key is-
sues that need clarification.
First on the list is the separation
of multiculturalism from integra-
tion. Integration happened long
ago. It happened for anyone from
a non-British lineage born in the
polite to actually take into account
the clearly expressed wishes of
the Iraqi people? That would mean
firstly not allowing our corporations
to lobby the fragile and dysfunction-
al Iraqi government, no doubt with
bribes and inducements (see BAE
Systems in Saudi Arabia), effec-
tively giving themselves control of
“one of the greatest material prizes
in world history.” Secondly, it would
mean withdrawing our troops in the
least damaging, yet most immedi-
ate manner possible. But this won’t
happen. The Iraq Study Group en-
dorses selling off the oil to the mul-
tinational companies, saying “The
United States should encourage
investment in Iraq’s oil sector by
the international community and
by international energy compa-
nies… and assist Iraqi leaders to
reorganize the national oil industry
as a commercial enterprise.” And
of course, Bush’s latest policy is to
send in 20,000 more troops to cre-
ate a surge of violence, and flush
out (i.e. kill) the “terrorists”.
This current course, disregarding
the opinions of the majority of peo-
ple both in Iraq and in the West, and
viewing all problems through the
crosshairs of a bombsight, could
in the long term bring peace to the
Middle East. Graveyards, after all,
are very peaceful places.

Integration simply means that a
person is absorbed into a new popu-
lation and is thus part of that soci-
ety. It is assimilation however that
is the important practical phase
when new arrivals begin to inter-
act and find their niche in society.
Furthermore, assimilation is an on-

elements. Without cooperation and
understanding, the future is bleak.
In all societies, there exist rene-
gades who detract and work against
the core values. And quite rightly,
these people should be dealt with
appropriately. But it is simply unac-
ceptable when a person is asked to
go against their own personal val-
ues, values that do not contradict
the core societal values.
So when a person exhibits Nazi
tendencies or when they blow
themselves up on an underground
train killing innocents, it is not mul-
ticulturalism that is at fault. It is not
the group from which they hail who
is at fault, nor is it the immigration
system that is at fault. It is rather
that they have failed to abide by the
core tenets of society and the line
between personal opinion and soci-
etal values has been blurred.
Obliging people to renounce their
personal values to make ‘society
better’ is neither practical nor jus-
tifiable. It is in fact a backward
suggestion. A society need not be
homogeneous to work. Blackmail-
ing the offspring of immigrants by
referring or making them feel akin
to ‘guests’ or second-class citizens
will not work either.
Culture is simply the flavouring of
an underlying product. Multicultur-
alism allows one to taste the differ-
ent flavours in which that product
may be found. One should be en-
couraged to taste the difference, for
it may encourage a different view.
going two-way process, where both
previously native and newly native
populations interact, communicate
and continually assess their ideas
and beliefs.
Yet, as a condition of citizenship,
those who immigrate are quite
rightly obliged to accept the rules
and framework of their host soci-
ety. They however, need not agree
with all the occurings within that
society, but fundamentally, they do
accept its core values – those along
the lines of tolerance, freedom of
speech, equality, justice and wel-
fare for all. As long as they accept
these basics, integration is a com-
pleted process.
The implementation of these core
values is nevertheless quite subjec-
tive and is defined by the people
that comprise a community. These
values allow for huge disagreement
in personal opinions, actions and
even legislation.
But this continual appraisal and
debate is an important cornerstone
of any progressive society, and one
which multiculturalism in fact facil-
itates. The concept of multicultur-
alism is that differences in opinion
should be respected, probed and
debated. This will in turn allow for
society’s core values to flourish.
If the debate is undertaken with
a constructive mindset, it will allow
those partaking to gain in knowl-
edge and understanding. Without
knowledge, there can only be scant
tolerance. With knowledge, there
can be respect. Multiculturalism
therefore seeks to build a more
prosperous, inclusive and progres-
sive society.
By distancing itself from multicul-
turalism and adopting an “enough
is enough” attitude, the British
government seems to be bowing to
the pressure of those from the far
right who show little interest in un-
derstanding those of any different
persuasion to themselves.
Yet this approach makes no sense.
Individual societies are no longer
the truly independent entities of
yesteryear, with no outside influ-
ence, but are composed of global

hey say it is the end of

Not only have people ac-
cepted this, but they are
preparing for what hap-
pens after it. A good country must
plan for at least 100 years in the
future (take Amsterdam’s flooding
problem for instance). So when the
next bad boy, China, has a little slip-
up like testing a ground-to-satellite
missile into outer space, which the
Foreign Ministry Liu Jianchao has
the audacity to call a “peaceful ac-
tivity”, you have to wonder what on
earth is going on.
Timothy Garton Ash, a well re-
spected Professor of European
Studies at Oxford University, has
previously stated that a handful of
far-sighted people in Washington
are beginning to formulate a long-
term American strategy of trying
to create an international environ-
ment that would protect common
interests even when American hy-
perpower has faded, and to encour-
age rising powers such as India and
China to sign up to such an order.
But the more concerning question
is, when China and India do rise,
how violent will the earthquake be?
And in the race for dominance, will
we see yet another pseudo-slave
trade-off of rights with advantages
for the prosperous nations?
Still hoping, still waiting.
