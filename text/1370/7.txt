COMMENT & OPINION comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk
So, hands up if you’ve heard of Clay-
ponds? No, thought not – you must
be an undergrad. Well, it’s the main
postgraduate halls at Imperial. Not
only are we mainly postgrad, we
are also “outlying”; meaning we
need to use the tube to get to Col-
lege everyday. At this point you’re
thinking - right, enough of that, next
page. But, if you can manage an-
other 3 minutes, I’ll try and explain
why some of us actually like it out
here and that Zone 1 isn’t the be all
and end all of London.
We’re not all lazy-arse PhD stu-
dents here, (sorry, correction,
your hard working, downtrodden
demonstrators). Its about 3/5 MSc
students with a smattering of lat-
ter year undergrads too, to add to
the PhDs. Clayponds was not built
as a hall of residence, but for real
working people, so is a mix of mod-
ern houses and flats. There are 330
residents here, but no more than
four share a kitchen, bathroom and
front door. We are surrounded on
two sides by a graveyard, and on
a third side a geriatric/rehabilita-
tion hospital – it’s quiet most for
time, and the neighbours never
complain about the noise. We’re in
South Ealing, six stops on the Pic-
cadilly line from South Ken, if that
helps. Right next door is Gunners-
bury Park, not quite as big as Hyde
Park, but has a stack of facilities, in-
cluding a pitch and putt golf course,
boating lake, cricket square, mu-
seum, not to mention 20+ football
and rugby pitches. That means we
play our inter-hall football games
on proper pitches, with full-sized
goals, painted lines and everything.
It seems to help, so far this season,
P7 W7 GD +28. I can’t complain.
Beyond sport, the pub local, the
Ealing Park Tavern isn’t a bad start.
However, since Time Out found it
and got into the habit of gushing
over it every week, it’s been hard
to get a seat. Ealing Broadway,
Kew and Richmond are all close,
all good drinking centres. Watching
the river ebb and flow from a water
front pub isn’t a bad waste of an af-
ternoon. In a few pubs near Kew,
your bench can be totally cut off by
the high tide; leaving you little more
to do than have another drink until
the towpath dries out. Clubbing
is a little more specialised in the
suburbs, but there is something for
everyone, the Boulevard and Red
Back seem popular with the resi-
dents… I say no more. Hall parties
are always popular, not sure if it’s
the free bar or the company, but the
results are invariably the same, see
the gallery at www.clayponds.org
for details. I guess the term-time
events here aren’t all that different
to any other hall, but Clayponds re-
ally comes into it’s own in the sum-
mer, when most undergrads are off
repaying their overdrafts. Volley-
ball or Croquet on the lawn accom-
panied by the ubiquitous barbeque
and Pimm’s almost makes the
place seem civilised.

I
t was Saturday December
30th 2006 that will go down in
history as a special date for
all Iraqis. The former leader
of a country, currently in a
civil war, was executed. The Iraqi
government had wished that Sadd-
am’s death would close a very ugly
chapter in Iraq’s long history. They
hoped that ending his life would
ease sectarian violence and decel-
erate the chaos that has consumed
Iraq for so many years. Instead it
has strengthened the hatred be-
tween the Iraqis and further divid-
ed the Muslim world. His death has
turned a tyrant into somewhat of a
martyr in the eyes of some. I, and so
many like me, have been left with
the burning question- How?
There is little doubt that the ty-
rant that was Saddam Hussein de-
served death. This man had terror-
ised, tortured and killed thousands
of people, including his own. Let
us start with a brief history. Born
on 28th April 1937 in a village 13km
from Tikirit, Saddam Hussein Abd
al-Majid al-Tikriti came from a poor
background. He was an average
person who never knew his father,
and apparently was mistreated by
his stepfather. He later went on to
study law in Baghdad, but never
completed his studies. Instead he
joined the nationalist Baath party
in 1957, which was soon involved in
the (US backed) attempted assassi-
nation of General Qassim. He then
fled to Egypt, where it is believed he
got his CIA training, and returned
to Iraq in 1964 and was subsequent-
ly imprisoned. The Baath party
then successfully assumed control
of Iraq in 1968 following a coup. To
cut a long story short, Saddam Hus-
sein quickly and ruthlessly rose to
power before becoming leader of
the country in 1979.
Following his rise to presidency
Saddam moved to consolidate his
power by holding a meeting in
which he accused several party
members of treason. These mem-
bers were then immediately arrest-
ed and many executed soon after.
The meeting itself was videotaped
and has been viewed by many Ira-
qis, and is a chilling reminder of
Saddam’s bloodthirsty nature.
Just over a year after he came into
power he invaded Iran after many
years of hostility between the two
countries. Iraq was plunged into
an 8 year war that saw both sides
lose at least 1 million lives. The war
eventually ended in a stalemate,
with both countries in financial dif-
ficulties and their infrastructures
destroyed. Then on 16th March 1988
Saddam used chemical weapons on
his own people to bomb Halabja,
a Kurdish town north of Baghdad.
The attack killed thousands and
left many thousands more severely
disabled. The war crimes commit-
ted by Saddam were mounting high
already. Barely 2 years passed be-
fore he went on to invade Kuwait
in order to strengthen his grip on
the Arab region. The US (backed
by the UN council) responded and
so began the Gulf War. An upris-
ing against Saddam followed, with
the US promising their support to
try and overthrow the Iraqi leader.
However, the US forces shame-
fully walked away and the upris-
ing was dealt with by Saddam, who
ruthlessly and meticulously killed
anyone involved and very quickly
crushed any resistance. The UN
then imposed sanctions on Iraq
that would cripple the country and
destroy the lives of millions. For
12 years Iraq suffered under these
sanctions with an estimated 500,000
children dying as a direct result of
the sanctions. Finally, following the
attacks of 9/11 the USA and Britain
(without UN backing) invaded Iraq
in 2003. Then on 9th December 2003
he was captured by US forces, found
in an underground bunker near his
home town Tikirit.
The trial of Saddam Hussein be-
gan in June 2004. He was initially
tried for the murder of 148 Shias
of the town of Dujail in 1982. In No-
vember 2006 he was found guilty
of these crimes and sentenced to
death along with 2 other defend-
ants, his half-brother and the head
of the Iraqi court in 1982. His ex-
ecution was ironically carried out
at Camp Justice. The day chosen
was the 1st day of Eid-al-Adha, one
of the holiest days on the Islamic
calendar. This inflamed the entire
Muslim world and many were unit-
ed in condemning the Iraqi govern-
ment in their handling of his execu-
tion. However, there appears to be
no coincidence in their actions. So
many factors went wrong, from the
date of his execution to the man-
ner in which it was carried out. It
was almost as if someone wanted to
maximise the effect his execution
had. Why was he tried for only one
of the many crimes he had com-
mitted? What about Halabja? What
about Iran? What about Kuwait?
What about all the untold murders
committed against civilians? No
doubt conspiracy theorists will be
itching to give an explanation.
For so many years Saddam Hus-
sein was the greatest enemy to al-
most every Iraqi. However, there
was widespread fear amongst the
people with his spies infiltrated
amongst the community. Whole
families would be tortured and
murdered if they opposed. Thou-
sands of civilians were condemned
as he spread his influence. As an
Iraqi Kurd his execution was sup-
posed to bring some relief to me. So
many years we Iraqis just dreamed
of an Iraq without Saddam. We
prayed that his tyrannic rule would
end. It appeared that Saddam was
untouchable and that we may never
livetoseehisruleendedandforIraq
to be liberated. However, it was the
manner of his demise, at the hands
of the very people who had placed
him in power. It was the shameful
and humiliating invasion and occu-
pation of Iraq by the US and British
forces. It was the many lies told by
the world leaders and the silence
of many others. I was disgusted to
see a report from BBC news which
described Saddam as the leader of
the Sunni world. To call that misin-
formation would be lying. There is
no doubt that a very small minority
of Sunnis supported him, as is the
The execution of Saddam
Mustaffa Junaid, an Iraqi Kurd, presents his feelings on the death of Saddam Hussein,
and what it means for Iraq as the coalition forces struggle to restore order in Baghdad
case with these psychotic leaders.
As a child I was always asked by my
fellow classmates whether I liked or
hated Saddam. I always answered
the same way; he was an evil man
whom no one liked. What frustrated
me then and now are the ignorant
ones, including some Iraqis who
now see him as a martyr, the only
true opposition to the US. Even in
death he was able to manipulate
matters. I am now left with the ob-
scure feeling of injustice. It was too
easy. After so many years of suf-
fering and worrying this man was
wiped off within a matter of 2 years.
His trial and execution have left a
bitter taste. The fall of Saddam was
bizarre, his trial was a circus act
and his death was surreal. Once he
was sentenced to death it left us lit-
tle chance to reflect before he was
executed. By ending his life they
have in fact increased the woes of
the Iraqis. There is no longer a hate
figure, so what is left? Civil war is
on the cards and it has been the
case ever since 2003.
Much of what has gone wrong in
Iraq is a direct result of foreign in-
fluence, which I have no wish to go
into presently. However, there is no
doubt what legacy Mr Blair and Mr
Bush have left themselves. They
invaded Iraq in 2003 with the false
pretence that they were liberating
a nation and spreading democracy.
Theyremovedatyrantandreplaced
him with a puppet government. The
world is united in their condemna-
tion of the US and Britain. The situ-
ation in the Middle East has wors-
ened immeasurably, and has now
become the true legacy for Blair
and Bush. How can a tyrant become
a martyr? That question will haunt
us for all time.
There is little
doubt that the
tyrant that was
Saddam Hussein
deserved death
