The best laid frags o’ mice an’ men
The CGC’s inaugral LAN event hit the Union last weekend. Nimalen Balsingham tells tales of war
H
e looked to his left,
paused, and glanced
to his right.
Coast was clear.
Adropofsweattrick-
led down his brow as his moved his
sweaty palm from his mouse to dry
them on his already damp jeans.
*BANG! BANG! BANG!*
That movement made all the
difference. It made him linger at
the corner just for a fraction of a
second too long; long enough for
the person sitting opposite him to
empty a magazine worth of bullets
through his bullet-proof vest and
into his body.
That was it… the Counter-Terror-
ists had won this round.
Sounds dramatic? Absolutely not.
This is a snapshot from the event
that took place in the Union Dining
Hall last Saturday, when the newly
formed Computer Games Club
(CGC) held its first event of the
year – a LAN (Local Area Network)
party.
From 10am, people came stream-
ing into the dining hall armed to the
teeth. Most of them had laptops,
but the more enthusiastic ones
even had desktops brought in with
them. After a quick sign-up, bags
were ripped opened, various kinds
of computers came buzzing to life
and gaming mice were whipped up
onto the tables. It was time to find
out whose mouse control was the
best, and who could think on their
butts as CounterStrike and DotA
(Warcraft III: Frozen Throne’s De-
fence of the Ancients) teams were
assembled.
For the next 6 hours, only the
low humming sounds from the
computers, the periodic taps on
the keyboards and furious click-
ing on the mice could be heard.
Of course, there were the rather
frequent swear words that echoed
through the room whenever some-
one ‘died’.
This is what happened at the
CGC’s first big event last Saturday.
For anyone who has missed it, rest
assured, there’s more future frag-
ging to be had..
The CGC was founded only early
this year by a group of gaming en-
thusiasts, the majority of whom are
in their 3rd year of study at Impe-
rial College.
The aim of CGC is to promote the
idea of LAN gaming to everyone.
LAN gaming is a simple process
whereby people connect their com-
puters to this huge ‘box’ and Lo and
Behold!, they are all wired up and
ready to play head to head against
one another.
CGC also aims to create a plat-
form where all gamers of Imperial
College can unite and play together.
There will be meetings, or rather,
gaming sessions held regularly so
that members can meet up and en-
joy gaming as a cohort. Instead of
playing games with strangers over
the internet and having nightmares
about how your opponent looks like,
with CGC, you can actually see who
you are playing with. Also, you will
know who the bugger who ended
your killing spree was and be able
to order a pie to be smashed into
his face the next time the Union
runs a hit squad.
Believe it or not, gaming actually
fosters teamwork and allows peo-
ple to understand the personality of
their gaming peers. In multiplayer
games, people are forced to work as
a team in order to win, and this kind
of co-operation and teamwork can
be applied to other areas of life, like
in studies or at work.
But it’s not just questionable
health benefits. Have you ever
thought what a loser the nerd sit-
ting behind you could be? Well,
nerd or not, he might just hand you
your butt on a silver platter when
you meet him in the virtual fight-
ing world! Besides, you can also
find out who amongst you are the
selfish, self-serving trouble makers
who only care about their own safe-
ty, or find the heroes that will lay
their lives down to rescue a team
mate in need.
CGC is not just a club for gam-
ers; it is a club by gamers. Thus, if
you are new to gaming or if you are
afraid to start due to the fear that
Counter-Strike remains one of the most popular games for competitive play, and was a firm favourite at the LAN event. Prefer other games? Email the society and suggest them
those proud experts will start own-
ing you, CGC is here to your rescue!
CGC has provisions for novice gam-
ers, and will teach you from scratch
how various game systems work,
and what you can do to improve
your gaming. You do not have to
worry about people calling you a
‘newbie’ or ‘feeder’ since all nov-
ices will start playing from ground
zero. When you yourself feel that
you are of the appropriate stand-
ard, you are most welcome to join
the higher level gamers and test
out your mettle.
CGC may not have the best gam-
ers, but when many good gamers
come together, the ultimate gaming
experience can be created.
CGC may still be a young club, but
plans for the future have already
been made. Come March, there will
be tournaments for 2 popular multi-
player games – CounterStrike and
DotA. Needless to say, attractive
After such a long read, what
are you waiting for? The mem-
bership is a measly £2 and this
will open a gateway to a whole
new world!

prizes stand to be won by the best
out there. There is not much time
left, so all gamers out there: assem-
ble your teams and start practic-
ing… for this will be an intense bat-
tle where literally only the strongest
and the smartest survive!
Besides that, a forum will be set
up just for gaming individuals in
Imperial College. Here, you can
discuss various strategies and
even news of any exciting upcom-
ing games. We’ll also try to arrange
trips to gaming conventions if any
are held in London.
The next LAN party session is go-
ing to be held on the 3rd of Febru-
ary 2007. Due to popular demand,
we will be playing Counter-Strike
1.6 and WarCraft3 FrozenThrone:
DotA. To sign up for this event
and our mailing list, please drop a
line at nb604@ic.ac.uk. You will be
required to bring your own laptop/
desktop and copy of the game. The
venue and time is yet to be con-
firmed, but will be provided to you
through email.
We hope to be pwning you all very
soon.
