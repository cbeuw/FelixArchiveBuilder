Bar restructuring faces problems
The Union bars have faced prob-
lems resulting from the implemen-
tation of a new Electronic Point of
Sale system (EPoS) and a change
in the management structure of the
bar.
The restructuring of the bar falls
under remit of the Union’s Com-
mercial Services division. Felix is
prevented from commenting on the
performance of staff members spe-
cifically by the Staff-Student Proto-
col (see page 4), but can comment
on the changes made by the divi-
sion as a whole.
The EPoS system was designed
to improve stock control in the bar
and to increase service speed. In-
stalling the EPoS system was a key
factor in deciding to change the way
the bars are managed, a new post
of Trading Manager was created
(which was filled by early Novem-
ber). This new position oversees all
of the Union bars and catering.
This led to a review of the bar
managers’ positions, as much of
their work was now rolled into the
Trading Manager position and the
EPoS system. The staff filling these
positions were offered pay cuts,
transfer to other positions, or vol-
untary redundancy. The three bar
managers chose to take the redun-
dancy package.
During this consultation period,
the student media (Felix and Live!)
were prevented from commenting
by employment law, despite cries
from the student staff about the
redundancies.
The student bar staff are classed
as ‘casual’ staff and were therefore
not included in the consultation.
Many at the time expressed their
dissatisfaction with the departure
of the three bar managers, whom
they felt loyal to, and raised their
concerns with the sabbs and senior
members of Commercial Services.
This reporter heard many criti-
cisms of the way the student staff
were treated, with many struggling
to find out what would be happen-
ing to their managers.
Many of the experienced student
staff then chose to leave once the
bar managers had taken redundan-
cy, citing their dissatisfaction with
the whole process. This left the
bars in a poor state, with the com-
munal atmosphere behind the bar
degenerating to the point of alleged
sabotage of systems to hamper the
newly arrived Trading Manager.
The new staff lacked experience,
and this lead to a plummet in the
quality of bar service (this reporter
has had trouble getting a full pint
pulled most days).
The new Trading Manager has
been left to deal with this situation.
However, things are slowly improv-
ing – training is continuing for the
new bar staff, and a number of oth-
er improvements have been seen in
the bars, such as new furniture, an
increase in catering quality, the in-
troduction of new house wines, and
the long-awaited introduction of
chips to the bar (this reporter likes
that a lot).
The EPoS system has so far
proved less than satisfactory. Both
old and new bar staff have com-
mented to Felix that the tills are
much slower than the old cash tills
(requiring scrolling through a long
menu for the correct drinks item)
and restrict staff to serving a sin-
gle customer at a time. The tills,
which are Windows-based, are also
prone to crashing mid-service due
to a software bug. Even sabbaticals
have been critical of the current
state of the system after working
behind the bar in recent weeks.
The tills are also not connected
across the Union core, meaning
the dBs and da Vinci’s tills operate
independently, though wiring is ap-
parently in place.
The server, which the tills report
to, has cost much more than previ-
ously reported (as “low hundreds”)
to the Executive Committee and is
Staff find the new EPoS system slow and crash-prone, and with many experienced student bar staff having
left in sympathy with members of Union staff who took redundancy during the management reshuffle
currently without a backup system.
Additionally, the Executive Com-
mittee believed that the new EPoS
system would be compatible with
the new “cashless” (pay by ‘smart’
swipe card) system the College
has been investigating; however,
it now appears that implementing
compatibility between the Union
and College systems could be very
expensive.
Many of these facts came to light
through comments made on an
article on Live!, the City & Guilds
online newspaper (available at live.
cgcu.net). The article concerned
the motion of no confidence in
WHAT...
WHAT?
INVISIBLE BIKE!
the Deputy President (Graduate
Students), Shama Rahman. How-
ever, the comments on the article
quickly developed into a free-for-
all on the sabbs and Commercial
Services on the way the restructing
was handled. At the time of going to
press, the article had more than 100
comments.
Many of the disgruntled com-
mentators questioned the original
reasons for the restructuring of the
bars, citing the fact that the bars are
turning over a healthy profit. The
Union shop, however, lost around
£7,000 last year, and online regalia
sales faring poorly, with £26,000 of
stock written off over the last few
years; this has drawn the attention
of the Union’s auditors.
Any change is of course fraught
with difficulty, and things have not
turned out as bad as they could
have.
There are still a number of issues
to be resolved, such as the role of
the Union shop and separate online
shop, the EPoS bugs and the train-
ing of new staff to replace the expe-
rienced staff.

bar restructuring, see page 4.
