What happened to the Union bars?
Over the summer, a “restructuring” of the bar took place which went largely unnoticed by the majority of
the student population. Now, after it’s all over, Jess Baker and Mez Pahlan reveal exactly what happened
T
he more observant
amongst you may have
noticed that changes
have been brewing
around the Union bars.
When you came back from your
long, lazy summer holidays, there
was a big asbestos-filled hole in-
stead of a central foyer, and da
Vinci’s had turned a lovely clinical
shade of green. But not all of the
changes that have been happening
have been so visibly noticeable.
The bars and catering at the
Union went through a complete
restructuring last term. This was
planned out during the summer
and put into action at the end of
August. At this time, the bars and
catering staff were invited to a
meeting with the Permanent Secre-
tary and the Commercial Services
manager to discuss the new EPOS
system and explain that there may
be some staff restructuring but
that there was nothing to worry
about. Student staff present at the
meeting expressed concern over
whether their jobs would be chang-
ing as a result of the restructuring
and were assured that there would
be no changes to the role of student
staff (this was later found to be un-
true after the abolishment of the bar
stewards role). The meeting was
held during the summer months so
most of the staff were at home or on
holiday. I can’t remember a single
student staff at that meeting who
still works for the Union today out
of shear disgust at being used and
lied to.
The word ‘consultation’ sends a
chill down the spine of anyone who
knows much about employment
law. What ‘consultation’ gener-
ally means is that people are being
made redundant. It of course came
out within a matter of hours that
the bar managers were facing re-
dundancy. The fact that they hadn’t
been informed that their staff were
being called in for a meeting was
even more of an insult. The looks
on their faces when we came back
and said, “are you being made re-
dundant?!” was heartbreaking. The
Catering Manager, John Ivory, also
made it very clear to us later on
that week that he was facing redun-
dancy as well.
It never really became clear to any
one of us, though, why the changes
were happening. In the executive
committee meeting of 21 Septem-
ber 2006, financial figures were
submitted for the 2005-2006 year. To
make things simple for you so that
you don’t have to wade through ac-
counting rubbish, the figures show
that:
• “Refectory” (bars and cater-
ing) made a “net surplus” of nearly
£120,000.
• The shop, on the other hand,
LOST nearly £8000
• Ents made a LOSS of over
£27,000.
The figures speak for themselves.
The Shop and Ents were haemor-
rhaging money, whilst the bars and
catering were making up the dif-
ference. So why were the manage-
ment systems in these areas being
changed?
I took it upon myself to try and
speak to the management of the Un-
ion about what was going on, what
were the reasons for it happening
and if it was possible that it could be
avoided. I sat with John Collins, our
president, for over an hour talking
about the bar; what needed to be
fixed, what worked, what didn’t and
finally why the changes were being
made. John told me that there was
no way back from the proceedings,
and that student staff jobs were
bound to change as the new struc-
ture involved having more perma-
nent members of staff who would
be on shift at the weekends. There
would be no need for any more
senior staff who worked without a
manager on the weekends. These
shifts earned the bar stewards ex-

tra money (due to the extra respon-
sibility they were undertaking) as
well as giving them experience in a
more managerial role than normal
bar staff. My experience with him
was not a pleasant one since he was
unwilling to listen to any suggestion
I had.
It transpired, through both the
conversation with John Collins and
later conversations with the bar
managers (Mick Dowling, Rob Doo-
ley and Si Bell) themselves, that the
bar managers were being offered
the chance to apply for the new jobs
which were being created. A new
position of Trading Manager would
be employed to oversee bars and
catering and there would be several
lesser “operational” managers be-
neath him. The managers had the
option of applying for Trading Man-
ager or taking the new equivalents
of their old jobs. The roles would be
reduced and so eventually would
their pay. All three of the manag-
ers ended up taking the voluntary
redundancy package. Most of the
experienced bar staff, disgusted at
the situation, left at this time.
For a while after the bar manag-
ers left, the bar was still operating
with Mick’s name as Designated
Premises Supervisor and none of
the new bar operations managers,
or the trading manager, were even
mentioned on the license! The signs
up at the Christmas carnival still
contained the old bar management
names. This kind of thing can get
a bar shut down if the local coun-
cil find out about it and there was
really no excuse for the names not
having been changed, as there was
more than enough notice to do so.
Some people have commented
that the bar is working better now
than ever - I hasten to disagree.
The few times I have been back the
service has been shoddy and I have
found myself instructing staff on
how to pour drinks professionally.
This is not my job any more – and

The staff-student
protocol
You may wonder why the students
were not told about what was hap-
pening to their bars before in pub-
lications such as Felix and Live!.
This is due to something called
– Staff Student Protocol (SSP)
(http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/re-
source/governance/mou.shtml#g).
SSP has become part of employ-
ment contracts within the Union
and it serves two main purposes.
To prevent permanent members
of staff (bar managers, catering
managers, finance staff, et al) from
interfering with the way the Union
is run. Conversely it also aims to
prevent members of ICU (that’s
you and me) from discussing per-
manent members of staff. The idea
being that a scenario whereby, “an
employee of the Union who was
criticised heavily in the student
media and chose to leave could sue
for constructive dismissal” (Ashley
Brown, Live! Editor) is avoided.
Whilst I agree with this aspect of
SSP there are two critical points
that disgust me so deeply that I
wish to make them known to a wid-
er audience.
I only did it because I wanted a de-
cent drink!
These people have stated that
the queues at the Christmas Car-
nival being shorter than those at
the summer carnival last year is
“proof” that the new management
are working better than the old
ones. What you might not know is
that under Mick, Rob and Si, last
year’s summer carnival last year
saw the largest bar take – ever. You
remember the one hour queues at
the bar? That’s because we were
about five staff short that night –
they were all on your side of the bar,
drinking, or had already gone home
for the summer.
This Christmas carnival, the
queues were a bit shorter (about
half an hour), but that’s because the
bar was fully staffed. There would
have been even shorter queues if
there had been any experienced
staff on duty, in fact with a full com-
plement of decent staff the queues
could have been down to about 10
minutes.
Some of the members of stu-
dent staff who had weathered the
change in management at the bar
were threatened with being fired
for expressing their opinion on a
non-college website (Facebook)
that they no longer enjoyed their
jobs as much as they used to. A cou-
ple of years ago bar staff, catering
and stewards were changed from
part-time to casual staff. There
would have been a real case for un-
fair dismissal if bar staff were still
part-time staff. The Union would
almost definitely have lost this case
costing the students money (lots of
money since there were quite a few
people involved).
