As you might have spotted, I
didn’t have time to do a crossword
last week, so I was rather pleased
when someone stepped in to do
one at short notice. However, it
seems Mr Barbatus has something
of a reputation for mischief, and
came up with a rather unfortunate-
ly impossible puzzle.
This week’s crossword may be
familiar to those of you with long
memories, though since no-one
solved it then, it’s clearly new to
some of you. Last time, there was
no prize, of course, so hopefully
someone’ll have a pop at it for the
tenner.

Send your answers to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk or bring this page
down to the Felix office in the West Wing of Beit Quad by Wednesday
9am. There was no winner last week, due to circumstances beyond our
control, so the prize money goes towards keeping Felix running for an-
other week. Dear god, we need it. We can’t even afford water.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
This week you notice
a portal to another
dimension located
just behind the second
drawer on your bed-
room dressing table.
Barnyard, as it’s known, is a world
without war, grief or strife – where
everyone lives in peace and tran-
quilty. Yeah, we can do satire too.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
So, this week’s TV
page has been demot-
ed to the horoscopes
page. Waking The
Dead. Watch it. Five
Days. Also watch it.
Er... Mona the Vampire is cackling
to herself all of a sudden. I think
she’s going to plunge her fangs
into my bratwurst... neck!
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
Fuck off phone. Re-
ally. Just fuck off. Your
incessant ringing is
going to make me
break you. I’m going
to break every bit of
plastic in your casing. I’m going to
rip you wire from wire. I’m going to
tear of your earpiece and shit down
your handset.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
Oh Smithers we do!
Oh Smithers we do!
OH SMITHERS WE
LOVE YOU! You are
a true legend of the
physics department.
Your enthusiasm knows no bounds
as you answer every question put
forth by every lecturer ever. Keep
it up. Your country needs you!
This Week’s Wii Remotes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
Well done crossword
fans. You didn’t pan-
der to The Bearded
Intruder’s juvenile at-
tempt for attention by
complaining about his
H.I.L.A.R.I.O.U.S. faux-crossword.
Do not support this vagabond! He
rapes babies whilst whispering
convulted sentences of grim death.

Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
This week you buy
a gun of the highest
calibre available. It
comes with the most
powerful .12 gauge
bullets you’ve ever
had the pleasure to shoot out of the
barrel of your most powerful gun
ever. The metal is made from the
best diamond ever and it rocks.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
So... the Felix “dun-
geon” as it is affec-
tionately known... No,
really. Considering I
live in a FUCKING
HELL HOLE, the
dungeon is pretty much a tramp’s
nirvana. ANYWAY, we’ve had a tidy
up. I can now eat my dinner off the
floor as well as out of your mum.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
You drop off your kids
at the swimming pool
as you do every Tues-
day. Unfortunately,
some bastard has
taken your parking
space. This is not on. Reverse bay
parking quickly ensues causing
catastrophic carnage. The clean up
operation is going to be a mess.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
This week your man
mammaries swell to
epic proportions. After
dishing out obligatory
squeezes to all your
friends, you decide to
get implants in yaw buttocks. You
sit down on a vicious cockroach
that burrows up your anus and
proceeds to devour your insides.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
I’ve got a glove full
of vaseline to lube up
your axe gash with. Of
Men And Mice refer-
ences are dominating
the newspaper this
week eh folks? Cultured bunch of
scatalogical shitbags us lot aren’t
we? Tip: make sure you twist and
stab, it ensures maximum seepage.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
Darling, I love you.
You know, the way you
smile when I call you
beautiful. The way
you walk with a slight
spring in your step. I
love when you rub your eyes in the
morning, surprised to find my seed
slathered unevenly. Ha! Spider-
man! You didn’t see that coming!

Get a fucking life
you beige-featured
bunch of queered-
up shit-brained piss
fumblers. Your sort
of cunt-eyed bog-

makes me physically
sick. Still, good luck.
