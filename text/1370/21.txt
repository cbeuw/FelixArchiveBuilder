W
hen you eat the
same kind of food
over and over
again, the taste
becomes burned
into your soul. I know this, because
after seven packets of Polos, my
tongue feels and tastes like the
Fox’s mint polar bear took a dump
on it. But – and I think you’ll find
this link pretty good – games are a
bit like that too, see?
Deus Ex sounded like a good idea.
It’s a straight run through – the
same challenges, but different ways
to overcome it. Of course, most of
them involved people dying, and a
lot of them involved cock-ups. For
the next Endurance trip, the all-
night gamers chose something that
required a full concentration bar all
the way to the final whistle. Hitman
is nothing if not that.
It still sounds like a crazy idea to
me, but taking on the thirteen core
missions of the assassin simulator
Hitman: Blood Money was nothing
if not unique. After painstakingly
planning a stylish route through
each level, all that remained was to
Endurance - Hitman: Blood Money
Tony Plana stalks the night with a sharp suit and sharper smile. The pay’s not great, but the perks...
set out on my mission. Some gam-
ers left kitchen knives as signs of
their passing on every target they
killed. Others procured their melee
weapons of choice on-site. Some
just blew shit up.
‘Blew shit up’ doesn’t quite ex-
press just how well some of the
plans went, of course (see “A Blow
Profile”), but there’s something
satisfying about taking the explo-
sive approach to H:BM. Possibly be-
cause, when time’s getting on and
you’re too tired to sedate that guard
for his uniform, well – you just toss
some explosives his way, or into the
nearest crowd of people, or... you
get the idea.
You can catch up with some of
the better hits on these pages. Of
course, some fought for Silent As-
sassin – the game’s best rating – for
each mission, others just tried to
make the most impressive mess.
They’re good at that.

A blow profile
Seemingly, Hitman is littered with
bomb-able places. Chairs, chande-
liers, cakes – dead dog carcasses
and flagpoles seem to be the only
things that you can’t shove some
plastique on and send into orbit.
But that’s not to say that some lev-
els didn’t take some ‘invention’ in
order to get that perfect explosion.
The House of Cards mission is a
good example. The setting is Las
Vegas, where a meeting is going to
take place between a Sheikh, a mad
scientist, and a white supremacist.
Stereotypes Anonymous are plan-
ning to exchange a briefcase full of
blood diamonds – the Hitman se-
ries’ equivalent of a cloth sack with
a dollar sign on it – for a briefcase
of rather important DNA samples. I
need to creatively kill all of them.
The meeting is to take place at a
swanky, belly-dancer-ridden casino,
so I break into the crazy South Afri-
can’s room and rig the DNA brief-
case with a bomb. Then, I simply
leave and wait in the ladies’ toilets
– for some strange reason, only men
seem to need to use the facilities in
this casino. And so I wait.
The meeting begins, and my
walking bomb passes security and
begins chatting with his buyer. And
I wait some more. He chats about
the usual stuff, I guess – whether
the slot machines are fixed. Celeb-
rity Big Brother. Genocidal armies
of clones.
I’m getting bored now, so I decide
to set off the bomb. Nothing hap-
pens. Thinking I’m too far away, I
stumble into the main area. Hit the
button. Nothing happens. Some-
thing very wrong is going on.
Then I hear a bad noise. There’s
an explosion from several floors
above, and the scientist is lying in
a pool of his own blood in his hotel
room. Somehow, the other briefcase
has exploded.
This, as you might imagine, is
something of a setback. It’s also
raised the in-game alert level to yel-
low, and since I massacred a boat
full of diners and a wedding full of
rednecks recently, well... it’s safe
to say that just about everyone’s
looking out for me. It’s not looking
good right now. I fall back on Agent
47’s mischevious days in primary
school, and hit the fire alarm.
Thankfully, one of the bellhops
seems confused by the alarm
– quite how you get confused about
a very loud noise and people run-
ning to the exit is a mystery to all
but the AI programmer – and hangs
around in a secluded spot for too
long. He soon finds himself uncon-
scious and naked in a box. Strut-
ting past the Sheikh’s security now,
ostensibly to deliver drinks to the
money-addled madman, the dis-
guise won’t last for very long. As I
pull out my second mine, ready to
place it in the compartment next
to the meeting, the DNA seller de-
cides to get up and stretch his legs
in my compartment.
It’s a tricky moment, where you
weigh up the pros and cons of set-
ting off a large explosive device in
the secure area of a very full casino
against just pretending to be a wait-
er for the rest of the day and seeing
what you can raise in tips.
I like to think I made the right
choice.
I don’t remember exactly what
happened between that moment
and running through the sprinkler
systems to my waiting limo, in a
hail of gunfire, confusion, and the
occasional headbutted civilian. The
newspapers claim that someone
looking suspiciously like a Tena-
cious D reject ‘massacred’ a huge
group at a Las Vegas casino. They
suspect blood money was involved,
but unfortunately – no-one ever
found the diamonds.
Inanunconnectedevent,Icouldn’t
find the briefcase I’d brought in with
me, so I took the Sheikh’s instead.
It had a lovely collection of marbles
in it. Cute.
