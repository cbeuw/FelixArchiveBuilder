Celebrate Britain and Britishness
W
e are writing to
petition for the
foundation of a
new society in our
Imperial College
Union – the Royal Society of Great
Britain, aka the BritSoc.
It is apparent that the dilution of
the British is beginning to cause a
lack of unity and therefore, to pro-
tect our identity we would suggest
the need for an entity to coagulate
us. One may say that the idea of
having a British society is absurd,
but every other country seems to
have its own society, in which they
are free to revel in the presence
of their compatriots. Take the Chi-
nese, they seem to be so tremen-
dously excited at being Chinese,
and so scared of forgetting their
mother-land they find it necessary
to have three societies. Yes, that’s
three. We wouldn’t be surprised if
sooner or later, we witness the for-
mation of a Homo-sapien society.
H-Sap. Soc. – ‘Lest we forget’.
One may argue that since we
are not exactly from overseas, we
shouldn’t qualify for an ‘overseas’
society. There is, however, great
need for an environment in which
we can bond with our fellow coun-
Valerio Chang
Valerio Chang believes the British deserve their own society to match the other overseas societies
trymen, just like the Malaysians
and Cypriots do. Being humans,
(just like the Greeks,) we feel more
at ease and comfortable talking to
people from our own culture, who
share our values and backgrounds.
Imagine a setting in which Bungle
and George, Fireman Sam and Su-
per Ted can all be reminisced about
freely without having some interna-
tional go, “who?!”.
Being so thinly spread, we think
we should even dare to consider
explicitly involving the Welsh, the
Irish and the Scots, to create an
environment where we can whine
about our dwindling numbers in
over-zealous regional accents in
attempt to fully exclude those from
abroad. If it is as popular as we be-
lieve it should be, it will become a
crucial tool in helping us avoid ac-
cidentally learning about other cul-
tures or languages whilst studying
at Imperial, providing the proverbi-
al ‘la la la, I’m not listening fingers
in the ears’ with a touch of class.
We will strive to represent the true
British culture within in this age of
multiculturalism and help others
to understand British traditions,
values and accents. We wish to pro-
mote awareness of the various as-
pects of our heritage, Queen’s Eng-
lish, ‘Imperialism’ (pun intended),
and our capacity to hold our ale.
Events we organize will include
ale drinking, extreme queuing,
beer drinking, extended periods of
not complaining, lager drinking, all
cumulating in some good old hoo-
liganism; no event would be com-
plete without it. Any non-British
will inevitably benefit hugely from a
bit of exposure to the pub culture,
brutish rugby games, fish and chips,
Cornish pastries, cricket, tea and
scones by the river, Monty Python
and good old Yorkshire puddings.
We do hope you will consider our
petition with the utmost serious-
ness, and look forward to the col-
lege-wide realization of the great
grandness of Great Britain.
Tally ho!
Typical people of Britain, laughing in a typically British way
H
ow often do you hear
these words: “Only at
Imperial would any-
one get that joke” or
has anyone ever been
witness to this phrase echoing
around the union bar: “I’m serious,
where are the women”? Imperial
College is the biggest self-loathing
group of people ever assembled in
one place.
I like to think of myself as quite
socially active in and out of Impe-
rial with, of course, other people at
this college and I still can’t seem
to grasp why we hate ourselves
so much. In case you’d forgotten,
here’s a list of reasons why we ain’t
no hollaback girls:
1) We’re the best college in
London.
2) We’re the richest college in the
U.K (mm, facilities)
3) We have in our possession at
least 400 times the debating power
of any other university on issues
regarding the Muslim integration
debate.
4) We don’t have any of those “art”
students; you know, the ones who
get those really wispy haircuts and
drone on about how much better
Joy Division are than New Order
or all those electro bands that copy
them but actually listen to Steps
and they seem to think that being
hygienic is a constriction of their
human rights: “I’m too much of a
free spirit to clean this fork, now
pass the bong; I have a higher plane
to reach.”
All that points to the good, right?
Wrong. So stupidly, annoyingly,
spoon to the eye wrong. For some
reason, we see ourselves as big fat
We’re not antisocial, honest guv
Nicholas English takes a look at what’s wrong with us at Imperial, and what we do well (hint: it’s not nothing)
pussy assed, spot infested, compu-
ter game obsessed geeks (or g33ks
depending on your world of choice:
choices include real and WoW). Far
too often do I see people in conver-
sation just laughing at how inept
Imperial is at events or moaning at
how expensive the formal dinners
are and how no-one goes to them
anyway it’s just a bunch of lecturers
getting shitted on wine that tastes
like it’s been secreted by an otter’s
pancreas. These things may be
true, but why dwell on them when
there is a wealth of things to do in
London. I know this sounds cliché
but it’s true, it’s the fucking biggest
city in fucking Europe.
A point many people seem to per-
sist upon is the lack of dynamism
offered by the Union in relation to
events. In defence of this point of
view, John Collins seems to have
rather special ideas about what we
require from him, by telling us the
union is not just about organising
events.
I’d be very surprised if more than
10% of students actually cared
about politics and the NUS (ok,
loads voted but only because you
e-harassed us into it, which I will
never forgive you for), but let’s
be honest, a massive percentile
of students want to get pissed 2, 3
times a week and spend the rest
concentrating on balancing work
and the rest of their life. Student
politics figures low low low down in
the list of priorities; if you asked all
the students whether they thought
their welfare was in good health at
imperial college they’d all chuckle
and say “Course mate, cheers for
asking” once you’re ten paces away
they’d be guffawing at the very idea
they had a rough ride at Imperial.
Although the new DaVinci’s layout
is sexy beyond belief, the union is
still guilty of making going out sec-
ond best, an immediate turn off for
any student.
As you can tell this mass self-dep-
recation is a great concern of mine
and after many hours of ruminat-
ing I’ve come to the only sensible
conclusion: Imperial College is to
blame. Not any figurehead, or rec-
tor or DPFS or DPGS or MFI or
B&Q but Imperial College as an
institution; how many of you re-
member at some point during your
open-day, visit or being in contact
with any imperialite prior to arriv-
ing at this institution, being told the
following facts: “Ah man, like you’ll
get a wicked degree and stuff but
like it’s 80-20 percent guys to girls”
or the classic: “It’s good here yeah
but like there’s only 3 English stu-
dents on my course” or the one I
was lucky enough to hear “This is
the JCR, never go there”. I know
what you’re thinking “Tss don’t be
daft, the fella was having a laugh”
well exactly and so are we when we
joke about the fact there’s no sand-
wiches left after 5 or something of a
similar ilk.
It’s not just the reputation gained
byImperial.Thelayoutissomething
to behold. It has so many uncom-
fortable social spots that it makes
you want to just sprint around col-
lege to avoid awkwardness. I’m
sure you’ve strolled down the Sher-
field Walkway, spotted a dear chum
from afar and he’s spotted you, you
know what’s coming but it’s too far
away to start a conversation, too
near to avoid and just down right
annoying. The same came be said
of every department, they all have
these absurdly long corridors with
walls that watch you as you walk
and close in as you get nearer the
pal in question so that you’re both
stuck in some sort of fake conver-
sation that doesn’t start or finish
within these confines.
But never fear, these are some
tried and tested pointers on how
to avoid any sort of cringe worthy
moment:
1) The army salute: performed,
with wink and click of tongue, with
the intention of being as cheesy as
possible from the offset so that it
can’t get any worse.
2) The bendy knees and double
gun shooting with win and click of
tongue, preceded by “eyyyyyy” a la
Fonz: hard to imagine but we’ve all
seen it and fake laughed.
3) The denial: both glance up
several times and only say “alright
mate” at the very last second.
4) Chanting of the name from at
least 50m away: crude but extreme-
ly effective, let’s other people know
that you’re happy to see this person
and that he’s obviously cool since
he has a chant for his name.
5) Casual conversation: worst pos-
sible, people can’t have 10 second
conversations, it’s just unethical.
6) My personal favourite: Run up
into their face at full tilt, body check-
ing them, fake punching or just
screaming “AAHAHAHAAAAHHH-
GGGHHH” right in their mug.
I hope this goes to show that we
need not mock ourselves for maybe
not being the most party-going col-
lege of all time but possess other
qualities. It’s what’s inside that
counts, other unis just have beer in
them.
“Any non-British
will inevitably
benefit hugely
from a bit of
exposure to the
pub culture”
At Imperial, we get them started young. Derive, you little bastard
