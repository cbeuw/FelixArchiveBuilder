It was a sunny January Wednesday
at Harlington when the IC ladies
1s took on RUMS ladies 1s. Hav-
ing worked off the mince pies and
Christmas cake during a frenzied
Monday training session, the girls
were well up for some top-class
hockey action!
Spirits were high in the changing
rooms despite a guest appearance
by Howard in goal, and there was
much discussion about five o’clock
shadows and wandering bikini
lines.
Out on the pitch, the IC ladies hit
RUMS hard from the first whistle
and after some nifty passing from
Span and Cate in midfield and total
domination of the D, Argentina’s
finest deflected a cross into the
goal. 1-0 to IC. A flurry of goals fol-
lowed including one each for Pru
and Lucy – losing their goal virgin-
ity in style – and one for Moonie.
With IC 4-0 up it looked like there
was no comeback for RUMs with
the defence looking solid and a little
bored. It was rumoured that there
was even time for some flirtation
between a certain defender and a
mystery man from the Mens 1s who
wears a lot of green. A lucky RUMS
break put the score to 4-1 but, by
half time, Argentina had struck
again and the score was 5-1.
After an inspirational half-time
chat, IC came out and looked dis-
tinctly lethargic. The second half
was slow-paced until IC were
awarded a penalty flick when a
AdLib by Tevong You
short corner was stopped by a foot
on the line. Womble drove it home
nutmegging the goalie. Cate struck
again for IC with an exemplary
strike from the top of the D, howev-
er the umpire controversially disal-
lowed it despite a torrent of abuse
from the sideline. RUMS fought
back in the second half and despite
scoring at the wrong end scored
another two. The final score was 7-
3 and player of the match went to
Howard.

They look like golf sticks but thankfully we haven’t had to print two issues with golf on the back page!
After one too many mince pies over
the festive period, returning to the
Fortress to play 70 minutes of gru-
elling hockey was a daunting task,
however the spirit of ICHC shone
through with what can only be de-
scribed as a demolition project!

Having not lost to the Medic scum
for over 2 years and having already
beaten them twice this season one
might have thought this match
was pointless, even so credit was
due to the medics for turning up
to a match that promised so much
humiliation!
Harvester, back from war wounds
to his forehead, regained his cap-
taincy from Date Rape and was
determined to see his squadron
perform as well as the Ladies! Sure
enough there were no lasting hang-
overs from Christmas and within
minutes the goals started flowing.
Slick interplay between Star Wars
and Toady caused havoc in the
Medics defence (as they have done
over the last four years) resulting in
a couple of flying goals. The short
corner routines seemed unstoppa-
ble and Jumanji was magical with
a final tally of five to his name. Not
forgetting the defensive players
who saw very little of the ball but
managed to perfect their celebra-
tion techniques, building on previ-
ous demonstrations by a certain
ladies captain! But on a serious
note Date Rape, Foetus and Ship-
man were solid and learnt a lot

about pills, child birth and profes-
sionalism while consoling the Med-
ics. The second half saw the de-
parture of Mountie and the arrival
of Batty, who with limited chances
left to bash some Medic arse took
the opportunity to make those in
red go red! He managed to feed the
forwards well, in particular the rat
who started scoring goals like the
plague.
With only minutes left and double
figures reached Date Rape decided
it was time provide the female sup-
porters with some long awaited at-
tention. While the rest of the IC 1sts
watched him work his magic the
Medics slipped a sly one past Plug
who having seen almost none of the
ball was getting some beauty sleep
A couple more were scored soon
after and the final whistle followed
with which came the formalities
– hand shakes, pats on the back and
a request not to publish a match re-
port (Oops!).
