Friday 12 January
★★★✩✩
So it was off to Fabric to write a
review on probably London’s most
well known club. What could I say
about the place that had not already
been said? Fortunately, having nev-
er read anything written about Fab-
ric, I present this review blissfully
unaware of the clichés that spew
from my fingers, infecting your deli-
cate mind with stagnant ideas.
As ever, the evening began with
impeccable timing. It was certainly
a convenience catching my friends
at the front of the queue, with zero
guest list waiting time. However,
arriving early enough to avoid them
queuing for an era meant I was still
a slave to the fundamental Fabric
paradox. This is that without the
help of magic beans or a small for-
tune, there will likely be always one
inconvenience. Arrive early enough
to avoid long queues, and, without
preparatory sleeping, you run the
risk of running out of energy and in-
toxication before 4AM (unless you
want to continue parting ways with
almost £4 for each bottle of beer).
Perhaps this is simply a personal
problem to feel defeated if I lose the
will to battle the night out until be-
ing kicked out of the venue.
Anyhow a trip to the stairs of se-
dation is all to common for those
who’s blood alcohol level have
swung one way or another from the
desired balance, those without the
energy to stand, or those who feel
like trying a conversation without
wondering whether the other per-
son speaks the same language as
you.
Getting to the bar, it was time to
start a little crowd analysis, try to
get a cross section of the 2007 Fab-
ric goer. It was immediately ob-
served an un-chartered ‘trendy hol-
lyoaks type’ had reared its pretty
head onto the scene, along with the
types that seemed to me had either
just missed Hoxton, or were in for a
pleasant surprise upon discovery of
the streets of Shoreditch.
More so, it seemed a stream of
newbies were amalgamating them-
selves with the masses, making
me feel like a veteran of the place,
having only been a humble three
times. The toilets echoed tales of
how many times people had vomit-
ed, and the confusion on how to use
the taps confirmed my suspicions
whilst giving me a more accurate
figure on how many were yet to
conclude the highs and lows of their
furtive first foray into the frantic fu-
rore of Fabric.
Onto the dance floor, despite it
being early, that didn’t mean you
couldn’t be stopped every few min-
utes by somebody with the manners
to kick over the drink you delicately
placed on the floor or barge into
your get fonky zone. Though this
did make me wish I had the spines
of a hedgehog, I soon realised I eas-
ily had the ability to do the same. L
double reliably played the first of
the enjoyable music, as I the crowd
bounced from person to person.
Though this situation
bouncers are oh so friendly (OK,
the rest is true.)
Giving up on Mylo appearing, it
was time to go home, feeling the
most refreshed I’ve ever felt leav-
ing a nightclub. Little did I know it
had been Mylo providing the back-
ing beat to my philosophical jour-
ney, seeing as his appearance was
mainly a DJ set, I left in the most
dancing mood I’d felt all evening.
Hearing tales of the quality of DJ
“live up to the” Hype’s set, perhaps
I felt tempted to return.
I’ll leave with the advice that if
you want to go along to Fabric, I’d
recommend doing so when a per-
former or a group of friends gives
you occasion to do so, making event
worthwhile, whichever way you deal
with the paradoxical obstacles.

time for relaxation, without the
kind of chatter that guarantees
loss of voice in the close future. As
the thumping bassline gave me a
sonic massage, I reflected upon the
review.
Although Fabric has its incon-
veniences, you are guaranteed an
eventful night. The large venue may
make it likely you lose your friend’s
but the likelihood is you’ll run into
somebody else you know – it’s hap-
pened every time I’ve been.
The club’s name means it draws
people from far and wide, and al-
though this brings about the phe-
nomenon of so many people com-
ing into London for their big night
out (making it a bit like going out in
Leicester square, with better mu-
sic). The sound systems are second
to none (as far as I know), and the
Next was Calvin Harris, which
sported some well prepared back-
ing music. Meanwhile the singer
dropped lines in the style of David
Bowie, without the lyrical prowess,
as he taught the recited the verb to
be, in the context “I am in the in-
dustry, you are in the industry”. Not
really my cup of tea, but I think I’d
spotted what had drawn the Hoxton
crowd. Next, Annie Mac supplied
some eclectic tunes, with basslines
just the right pitch to make you
constantly think your phone’s go-
ing off.
Becoming weary and not wanting
to join the stairs social scene for
two long, I was fortunate enough
to find a sofa on the balcony above
the stage whilst waiting for Mylo
to come on. This proved one of the
most highlights of the evening. A
Mylo, taking a break from his natural habitat of a banging nightclub
2007: Survival of the hottest
New clubnights springing up everywhere, electro on the up,
‘nu-rave’ died on its ass, Trash is dead! So what’s hot or not?
if it becomes nearly as popular, or
another night comes along to steal
alltheTrashkidsonaMondaynight.
If you’re looking for something on a
Tuesday night, and want to make a
change from Panic! then you could
check out Love Is All at Proud, it’s
a new weekly charity band and DJ
night and should be good fun.
It seems that Metro Club on
Oxford Street is going seriously
downhill recently, their main target
audience being unoriginal Indie or
metal kiddies who like hearing the
same thing over and over and over
again. You’re even likely to hear the
same Nirvana track 3 times in one
night at that place. Oh well, what-
ever makes money I suppose.
If Trance is your thing, then you
might want to check out Tran-
science, again at Proud in Camden
offering a wonderful mix of psych-
edelic trance and ultra chill out it’s
the best place for any Trance addict
to spend their Sunday night. Right
near Cyberdog too so you can stock
up on your raver outfits and glo-
sticks beforehand!
Finally, somewhere never to visit
is those terrible chain clubs (Bar-
Rumba, Walkabout etc.) If you’ve
resorted to that we seriously sug-
gest you go out and buy a Timout
magazine and look what is actually
happening in this huge city.
Chalk might be one of the contend-
ers for being the next amazing club
night, as long as they keep to the for-
mat of it being a proper Indie night
and don’t go down the road of Indie
‘superclubs’ like NME, and speak-
ing of NME they are going down, in
fact they are at the top of our list of
horrendous clubnights never to at-
tend unless you really really need
to go out on a Friday night .
The new replacement for Trash
seems pretty good too, DURRR
is basically a club night that’s be-
ing run by all the other Trash DJ’s
apart from Erol Alkan, so I can only
assume it will be basically just like
Trash used to be. Only time will tell
