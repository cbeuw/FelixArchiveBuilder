H
ello! Welcome to a
wonderful new term
of hard revision,
exams and stress.
Fear not though, for
Nightlife has returned. You may
have noticed a lack of things noc-
turnally related in the last two
issues of Felix, this is due to two
things.
Firstly, we don’t have enough re-
viewers! We need you lovely peo-
ple to go forth and party for the
name of journalism (and so I can
make a page without actually writ-
ing anything myself) - first years,
I’m looking at you. I know for a
fact that you go out to clubs some
nights of the week, so why not do
it all for free? Some lucky review-
ers last year even got unlimited
bar tabs at the venues they were
visiting - all for a simple 700 word
review! You can go anywhere you
like, just email us to the address
at the top of the page suggesting
where you’d like to check out.
The second reason why there
was no Nightlife sections in the
last two issues is that I have decid-
ed to make this page bi-monthly:
firstly, I don’t have the time to de-
vote to making the page look nice
every week and secondly, it makes
it more interesting because we
have more material to print! Any-
way, that’s it for now. Officially the
most boring editorial ever, so read
the articles now.
Welcome

Corsten hits Turnmills
Felix goes armed with a healthy supply of glowsticks and, of course, plenty of water to
check out the Dutch Trance master spinning the decks for a thumping four hour set
very much called for encore.
The atmosphere in Turnmills was
very friendly from the shades-wear-
ing,tank topcladgayguystotheglo-
stick spinning hardcore shufflers:
everyone was smiling and seemed
to be having the time of their lives
which can best be summed up from
the track Beautiful: Everything is
beautiful, Let the music carry you,
Maybe i will follow you, forever!,
Nowhere else I’d rather be, When
you’re lying next to me, Let the mu-
sic carry us, together!..
Everyone seemed to be in love
with everyone else while being ab-
solutely amazed in their trance-like
state with the laser lights! Needless
to say the atmosphere on the dance
floor was purely euphoric.
The main room was full to capac-
ity, not really surprising as it is mi-
niscule for a house-club standard.
For those of you who have never
been to Turnmills, it is a medium-
sized club (yes, smaller than Fab-
The end of Trash club
For the past ten years Trash has
been hosting the coolest night-
spot for anybody who thinks they
are somebody in the ‘indie’ music
scene.
Being one of the most fashionable
clubs in town means the girl on the
door can pick and choose who en-
ters, and towards midnight at the
last ever Trash she really had her
work cut out. It seemed that half
the entire population of London
wanted to be there, the queue work-
ing its way round the block and fur-
ther even 2 hours before the place
opened.
I turned up rather late, and most
of the people trying to get in once
they’d reached capacity were total
arseholes, and the fact the police
turned up at one point with three
vans to arrest a large proportion of
the queue only confirmed this.
You might think from reading this
that everyone was going to be a
twat in the club, but it was in fact
the complete opposite, the reason
all the scenester-coke head toss-
ers were outside was because they
were not getting let in. The Trash
crew did an excellent job of only let-
ting true music fans in for the final
night, and made absolutely sure
they didn’t overcrowd the place,
which resulted in what I believe
was the best night I’ve ever been
to at The End Club. Erol was DJing
the whole night after about mid-
night, playing his usual mish mash
of electro, indie, new-wave and any-
thing else, only this week he only
played the total classics. Basically
awesome.
They opened the entire venue up
for the final event, which was the
only time I’d seen it that way and
gave it a capacity of 850 fans. Eve-
ryone was happy and I it seemed
everyone I bumped into I rec-
ognised, which made for a great
friendly atmosphere. The Arctic
Monkeys even decided to turn up
at one point, and I must say, they
do not look good on the dance floor,
they dance like retards. Apparently
I also met one of the guys from
Soulwax in there too but I don’t re-
ally remember that part too well. I
give this night 5/5 easily. By the way,
the last song was Abba - Dancing
Queen. Some of the more emotional
(drunk?) Trashsters actually cried,
which shows how highly some peo-

ric’s warehouse-like club) with
three small-ish main rooms and a
few ante-rooms in between, dotted
with lounge chairs. It has a very
quaint ambience with a maze like
quality to it not for the claustropho-
bic. And if not for the state-of-the-
art sound system blasting thumped
up tunes, few high and mighty rav-
ers could make it back to the dance
floors.

the friendliness of the staff; bounc-

not gave us any trouble when one of
my friends forgot to bring the credit
card with which she purchased her
tickets on-line, or when I asked for
a replacement cloakroom ticket af-
ter losing mine.
The drink prices however, were
much to be desired being at the up-
per end of the scale (£9 for a double
shot!) and they seemed to run out
of tequila before 2am.
Undeniably there are other DJs
spinning in the other rooms, with
Tristan Da Cuhna (BackToBasics),
Dave Mills (Cool House) and Tania
von Pear (the Gallery) spinning in
Room 2 and John Rundell, Dave
Randall, James Kinetic and Ther-
mobee DJing in Room 3. Good as
I’m sure they are, they’re no Ferry
so to be perfectly honest I did not
spend time outside of Room 1 at all,
save for the occasional toilet break
to fill up my water bottle.
We left the place at 7am, but even
the terrible rainy English weather
could not dampen our satisfaction
after a night of trance by the great
Dutch Trance master. With great
big names in the Trance genre fi-
nally returning, I could not help but
feel that the clubbing scene in Lon-
don is finally looking up. Paul Van
Dyk will be playing in two weeks’
time in Turnmills and I fully intend
to be there.

along with other happy people, I ex-
perienced true happiness last Fri-
day when the Gallery in Turnmills
witnessed one of the demi-gods in
Trance, Ferry Corsten, DJ and pro-
ducer, spinning a four-hour set sup-
ported by Spanish superstar Abel
Ramos, and the Gallery resident
Gavyn Mytchell.
Harry Brown (who?) gave his
best prepping the dance floor from
1030pm to an audience who were
politely disguising their disinterest
but by 1am, around the time Fer-
ry’s due on the decks, clubbers who
came from all over the country from
Wales to Nottingham started chant-
ing for Ferry to take the decks and
put this poor soul out of his misery.
Ferry did not disappoint by spin-
ning one infectious track after an-
other mainly from his latest album
L.E.P (Loud, Electronic, Ferocious)
to the delight of the very ecstatic
ravers. It was definitely loud, elec-
tronic and ferocious when he spun
new tracks as well as updated ver-
sions of his earlier works like Junk
and Beautiful and he kept the crowd
going all night (or morning).
I wanna make you feel like
you’re on fire (the vocal tunes from
the track Fire) and the world class
DJ did just that to the delight of the
frenzied crowd. Few left the jam-
packed dance floor until he wrapped
up his set at around 5am after a
