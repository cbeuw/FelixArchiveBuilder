Perk of peeing in sink: it’s hands free
Nonsensical title leading the way in music journalism, you saw it here first, kids
I knew it was going to be difficult re-
viewing a gig from a Carling venue
following the last Deftones album
(coincidently they’re playing Brix-
ton Academy in April). I arrived just
in time for the ominously titled Mis-
ery Signals set. In fact, they were
better than a lot things I have seen,
even if from where I was standing
they were playing pretty straight-
up, run-of-the-mill ‘hXc’, complete
with idiotic hardcore dancing in the
pit.
Minor entertainments aside, I
overcame my typically antisocial
ways to chat with a few Imperial
people. Like most people in the
audience, they’d come mainly to
see the second act, tech-metallers
Between the Buried and Me (the
name in fact is taken from a song
by Counting Crowes), or BTBAM
as I shall refer to them for sake of
space. As their set began, the lead
singer sprang into life with an un-
nerving ferocity, eyes glazed like a
lunatic, whilst the talented instru-
mentalists let rip with the kind of
robotic precision that made one
wonder whether they were actu-
ally watching some kind of ornate
mechanism. Forgetting the fantas-
tic show that they were putting on,
one could easily think that these
guys had day jobs in accountancy.
And then their set finished, pain-
fully short for my liking. A short
time passed while the awe faded,
and Darkest Hour spilled out
onto the stage, more like a ragtag
bunch of random blokes pulled of
the street then the campy gothic
nonsense of Atreyu and their ilk.
They then proceeded to belt out
an intense string of powerful songs
with virtually no let-up, easily grab-
bing the audience attention, even if
they were a little too reminiscent
of Slaughter of the Soul era At the
Gates for me. Ostensibly a ‘metal-
core’ show, though one at least that
showed the true variety of some of
the more underground, and dare I
say it under-rated bands.

ood riddance to
2006! It really, re-
ally sucked for music
and don’t try argu-
ing with me on this.
After looking at the inevitable
end-of-year-best-of-compilation-
column-fodders, I can’t believe I
didn’t give up on music last year.
It was a year where noise and
free-folk gained more ground in
people’s record collections – I, for
one, enjoyed Raccoo-oo-oon’s Is
Night People amongst a few other
gems. However, the sheer amount
of noise bands both reinforced a
DIY aesthetic and made most of
the ideas of noise redundant. The
more sparse and ambient experi-
ments in noise caught my atten-
tion by way of My Cat Is An Alien;
recent discovery called Tiger Piss
delighted and intrigued me in
equal measure.
Free-folk and folk-inspired
things did interest me with the
emergence of James Blackshaw
and the plaintive Hush Arbors. I
think 2006 was a year for the in-
crease in the role of DIY; various
promoters gained more momen-
tum. With the major labels trying
to save face through signing any-
thing with guitars in and increas-
ing their presence on the internet
(yet not changing their business
plan), hopefully more power will
be given back to listeners. We
need a fucking revolution, we need
something akin to 1976!
There were a few gems last year
that kept me going: Styne Vallis by
Reigns (West Country electronica
with live instruments with, yes,
tunes); This Ain’t A Hate Thing,
It’s A Love Thing by Lords (fan-
tastic blues riffs by way of Captain
Beefheart with off-kilter time and
structure); I Am Not Afraid Of You
And I Will Beat Your Ass by Yo La
Tengo (awful title, brilliant return
to form); Ys by Joanna Newsom (if
you are not put off by her voice – I
was at first – then you will appre-
ciate magic happening).
One last thing. I recommend
you come along to the Union (dB’s
more specifically) on Saturday
27th January at 8pm (tomorrow)
for a night of sumptuous music in
the way of the Kids Will Be Skel-
etons club-night. Restlesslist will
be headlining and they make in-
die-alt-hip-hop and feature mem-
bers of The Brakes and Electric
Soft Parade. There are two more
bands and it costs just £4 for stu-
dents; this is cheap, believe me.

album review
In conjunction with the recent ad-
ditions to the EU, I thought review-
ing an album from Romania would
make some sense. Few people
reading this would have known for
instance that Bucharest has a bur-
geoning hip-hop scene, or heard
any music in the language beyond
the infamous Numa Numa song!
This only makes it more difficult ex-
plaining that Negura Bunget is an
extreme metal band from, wait for
it, the dark and mysterious moun-
tains of Transylvania! To be honest
though, there isn’t much intrinsical-
ly Transylvanian in this band at all,
and their main influences are quite
evidently from the well established
metal community of Scandinavia.
The title OM is a pun on the Roma-
nian word for man and the sacred
eastern symbol, Aum. A similar
disparity of message exists on this
record, where much the guitars can
be considered pretty stripped-down
in that gritty and unabashedly true
black metal way; but with higher
production values for just about
everything else. The vocals tending
towards growled chanting, a la Nile,
interspersed by epic passages with
clean singing and pseudo-classical
instrumentals.
The result is a refreshingly cos-
mopolitan mixture, which is also
the hitch to an extent as the result-
ing mixture can sound a little bit
disjointed in places. Fortunately,
Negura’s aspirations have more or
less paid off with this album, which
sees the band moving towards the
kind of avant-garde metal postu-
lated by bands like Enslaved. Thus
I feel that this is a very promising
effort overall, though one with an
unquestionably been there, done
that feel to it.

single review
Every now and then, there shines a
little glimmer of hope in the world
of music and individuality reintro-
duces itself and pokes us in the
ears. Why is this song this great?
Well, because honestly, you cannot
compare it to any other song. The
difficultly now-a-days in producing
totally new sounds can be seen by
how many re-releases, own rendi-
tions and no-effort songs are con-
tinually released. So on rare occa-
sions when a song such as this is
produced, it’s only appropriate to
get a bit excited, right?
Just Jack comprises of North-
Londoner Jack (obviously) Allsopp
(you might have not known his sur-
name) and his genre of music is a
bit of pop, a bit of house, and a pinch
of hip-hop with garage roots. Starz
In Their Eyes is his second release
with a strong up-beat composed of
drums and what I’m guessing to be
the banjo. The song comprises of a
good bassline and is a dance-along
tune. Not only does Just Jack unite
his diverse music tastes in this song
but also provides lyrically genius by
describing – poetically – the lives of
ordinary people changing into ce-
lebrities to find out the ‘dream’ life
is not as pleasant as they always
thought.
Watch out for his eagerly antici-
pated LP
, Overtones, his music will
be a great part of the new sounds
of 2007.

single review
This song I describe as the ‘happy,
happy, happy song’, just due to the
high notes singer, Mika Penniman,
reaches in it and the rainbows he is
lyrically painting. There is a cheer-
ful piano melody with a sort-of
marching beat and the song can be
described as power-pop.
The first time I was introduced
to Mika’s music was at a gig re-
cently and he was definitely the
liveliest act there easily. He was
introduced as being vocally compa-
rable to Freddie Mercury but what
I think they missed out is a vocal
tint of Justin Hawkins (The Dark-
ness) and the musical style of Jake
Shears (Scissor Sisters), because
I can really hear the similarities
between their music. I had to dock
one star because the debut single,
Relax, Take It Easy was just that
little bit better.
Mika was also on Jools Holland’s
annual New Year show, Jools Hol-
land’s Hootenanny and was tipped
to be the hottest thing for 2007. The
predictions on that show seem al-
ways to be right, so start saving for
the album, Life In A Cartoon Mo-
tion which will be released soon. I
guess you can say Mika Penni-man,
he will be no more as he is set for a
successful year.

Pac’s Life

★★★✩✩
single review
Another track from ‘Pac. Will this
‘icon’ ever rest in peace? Every
time he releases a new single I
assume his death is just a public-
ity stunt. Between Biggie and ‘Pac
I do not know who is worse. Well
do you really want to know about
‘Pac’s Life? No, I am more inter-
ested in how I am going to survive
one more year in IC thank you very
much. This track doesn’t really tell
us more than we already know nei-
ther; is it going to make me rush to
the cash machine and withdraw my
£5 to purchase his overpriced sin-
gle at HMV? Yes, I am a hater, I am
living and I ain’t making no paper.
I am still that poor, broke student
waiting for that fabulous IB job.
Pac’s Life is a zingy but chilled
club track. Certainly a club topper,
but with poor lyrics; no one cares
anymore about Pac’s trials and the
tribulations of his hip-hop stardom
instead they should have scrapped
all the Pac bits and left T.I. on the
whole track, now that’s what I’m
talking about; ‘THE KING’ left his
signature on Pac’s Life. Ashanti
adds a soulful pitch to the track so
we can say a big thank you to her
for salvaging the song. It’s a nice
single but nothing exciting.

single review
Ah! Would we say refreshing? May-
be! Newly signed Def Jam-new-
bie Lady Sovereign also known as
Lady ‘SOV’ drops her crazy grimy
London accent on some mad beats.
This track would definitely get you
on the dance floor, it begins with
a very techno super Mario theme
beat that just gets you crazy and
her voice is truly unique and I have
not began to explain the remix fea-
turing Missy Elliot. The remix defi-
nitely lives up the myth that remix-
es are way better than the original.
Missy drops some fantastic vocals
in her usual style most of it doesn’t
make sense but then we all love a
Missy Elliot production. Although
this single is definitely jamming,
Lady Sov is certainly of an acquired
taste especially if you like different.
