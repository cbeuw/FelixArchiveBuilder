Competition launched College-wide with a first prize of £2500
and judged by Professor Lord Robert Winston among others
The question
Almost 100 people attended the
launch of the Royal College of Sci-
ence Union (RCSU) “Science Chal-
lenge” in the Blackett Lab on Tues-
day night.
The aim of the competition is to
write an 800 word essay on the top-
ic revealed by RCSU President, Jad
Marrouche. Mr Marrouche spoke
for half an hour on the topic, reveal-
ing the question to be: “What scien-
tific development or breakthrough
do you think will be most significant
within the next hundred years?”
The theme ties in with Imperial
College’s Centenary year; the Col-
lege was founded in 1907.
The RCSU and its President have
assembled a prestigious group of
judges for the award. Professor
Lord Robert Winston, the much-tel-
evised fertility expert (and Emeri-
tus Professor in Fertility Studies at
the College) is to take part, along-
side Dr Simon Singh MBE (an
Imperial alumnus, writer of The
Code Book and other popular sci-
ence books), Dr Raj Persaud (psy-
chiatrist, Radio 4 presenter of All In
The Mind, and journalist), and Dr
Roger Highfield (Science Editor at
the Daily Telegraph).
This expert panel will judge the fi-
nal entries after they’ve been pared
down by a panel of academics from
the College.
First prize is £2500, a day shad-
owing Dr Highfield at the Daily
Telegraph, and a top-of-the-range
Apple Macbook. Five runners-up
will be given £100 and a bottle of
champagne, with submissions be-
ing considered for publication in
the Daily Telegraph.
The prizes have been kindly
provided by Apple, Cockburn &
Campbell, Schlumberger, and the
Telegraph.
All entries must be submitted by
23 February, and can be entered
online (at http://rcsu.org.uk/index.
php?page/challenge) or on paper to
the RCSU office. The Grand Final,
which has been promised coverage
by the BBC, Telegraph, Times, In-
dependent and Guardian, will take
place on 9 March at a yet-to-be-de-
termined location.
