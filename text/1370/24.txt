Phoenix
The arts magazine
of Imperial College
Phoenix is the arts magazine companion
to Felix. It has existed for more than ninety
years, and was originally edited by H. G.
Wells.
This year, we’re looking to re-establish
Phoenix as a regular (termly) magazine,
along with an editorial team independent
from Felix. If you’re interested in
contributing work, designing the magazine,
or helping out in any way, contact the editor
of Phoenix (hugh.stickley-mansfield@
imperial.ac.uk), or the Felix editor (felix@
imperial.ac.uk).
