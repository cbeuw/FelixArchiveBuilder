Brittania will rule, OK?
Oscar nominations are out and rumours abound, but the results are anyone’s guess
This last year has been a fairly
good one for film, not stellar, but
quite good. We’ve seen some life
breathed back into the Bond series,
and an abundance of good fantasy
and drama such as Pan’s Laby-
rinth, Tideland, and Babel.
The awards ceremonies have so
far reflected this, and have already
rewarded some genuinely good
films. However, we still have the
main event still to come.
The Oscars: a time where the en-
tire film industry decides what re-
flects their best efforts of the past
year. The Oscars are always a re-
minder of everything that is both
hated and loved about the great
Hollywood dream.
This year is no different. A quick
glance at the nominations list to
your right, and you will see samey
and predictable choices nestling
beside some interesting selections.
This year sees the grand institu-
tion of British drama given several
nominations, with Helen Mirren,

It’s time for the annual trip to Os-
carsville.Whilepoliticsandpopular-
ity competitions sometimes render
the awards defunct, this year there
are some genuinely good actors up
for accolades this year.
Sadly we have no prizes for you
this week, but feel free to guess the
character/film combination anyway.
You may well win my respect.
She prods buttock in a furry helmet
Some films seem destined never to
be completed. Famously, a whole
film came from Terry Gilliam’s in-
ability to complete The Man Who
Killed Don Quixote, but most are
simply never heard of again. A few
years back, a project that seemed
to be headed that way was The Last
Man, an epic with a suitably epic
budget helmed by Darren Aronof-
sky, director of Pi and Requiem for
a Dream, both of which were suit-
ably fresh in the studio’s minds to
impress them into shelling out a
great deal on his epoch-spanning
work about eternal life.
However, then things started to
fall apart - the lead actor left due
to creative differences, the studio
pulled out and there was talk of Ar-
onofsky adapting Batman, Watch-
men and Cat’s Cradle. Years later,
however, he managed to complete
a scaled-back version, titled: ‘The
Fountain’, for less than half the
original cost of the aborted version.
Unfortunately, it really does
show; with the exception of one
location, every scene is noticeably
studio-based. It becomes difficult
to suspend disbelief when it’s clear
that everything has been shot in
the same building, be it a labora-
tory, a Mayan temple, a bubble
floating through space, a jungle, or
a curiously one-sided street. It feels
more like a television drama than a
proper film, as such. Only twice do
we even see brief fragments of jour-
neys between one place and anoth-
er, lending the work a fragmented,
disjointed feel.
It doesn’t help matters that the
story consists of three narratives
in the past, present and future, Hugh Jackman: Conquistador, doctor, and futurstic bubble-naut
ostensibly about the same charac-
ters, flitting from one to another
and leaving gaps in each story. The
future segment, particularly, omits
more than it contains - at no point is
it clear how this man got where he
is, who he is and how he knows to do
what he is doing. Of all the aspects
of the film, this is the most irksome,
since the other two narratives hold
together very well, and the links be-
tween all three are sound.
These stories themselves, un-
derneath the stylistic trappings,
concern themselves with the quest
for eternal life, in some form or an-
other; a conquistador searching for
the tree of life in Central America,
a doctor searching for a cure for
his wife’s cancer, and a chap travel-
ling in a bubble toward a dying star
which will grant him and his tree
eternal life together. Or something.
Profound and beautiful as it all un-
doubtedly is, there is very little in
the way of explanation for the fu-
ture segment; since the lead char-
acter in each era is played by Hugh
Jackman - played very well, I might
add - it is unclear as to whether he
is meant to be the same character
as in the present, or whether he is
just another reincarnation of the
conquistador. It’s hard to shake the
feeling that we aren’t being told the
whole story, and since the screen-
play was rewritten to accommodate
a massive cut in budget it’s a fair
bet that we really aren’t.
Though if you can cope with the
confusing storyline (which is hardly
any more complex than the aver-
age Lynch offering) and lamentable
lack of funding, it really is a spec-
tacular work - the special effects
were realised by filming chemical
reactions on petri dishes rather
than through CGI, in a very suc-
cessful attempt to lend it a timeless
and organic air. The result is noth-
ing less than magnificent, and the
denouement is visually breathtak-
ing. The music, too, is impeccable
- Aronofsky’s long-time collabora-
tor, Clint Mansell again provides
the score, performed by the Kronos
Quartet (who worked on Requiem
for a Dream, also) and Mogwai
(who didn’t), without the electronic
edge he brought to Pi and Requiem,
similarly striving to be timeless and
organic in feel. As such, both the
music and the cinematography are
ultimately successful in their goals,
and very satisfying to boot.
It’s just the stuff holding them to-
gether that doesn’t quite work.

Forest Whitaker appears to be a
dead cert for Best Actor this year,
although this could be upset by
Helen Mirren’s similar type of role
Judi Dench, and Kate Winslet con-
tending for the Best Actress catego-
ry, along with the venerated Meryl
Streep. Helen Mirren is clearly the
favourite, especially after her Gold-
en Globes sweep. Peter O’Toole
also receives a nomination for Best
Actor, possibly as a reaction to the
lifetime achievement award that he
was given a few years ago to which
he responded: “But I’m still a work-
ing actor...”
Babel, Dreamgirls, Pan’s Laby-
rinth, and The Queen are all up
for multiple nominations, some
of which are well-earned, and the
legend that has become An Incon-
venient Truth is almost certainly
poised for recognition.
The Best Director category is
probably the least predicatable
category this year, with Alejan-
dro González Iñárritu, Stephen
Frears and Martin Scorsese
neck-and-neck.
Following the trend for biographi-
cally realistic portrayals in recent
years, after Phillip Seymour Hoff-
man won Best Actor for Capote,
in Best Actress. This year appears
torn in several directions. As al-
ways, this is all just guesswork, and
uncertainty reigns supreme.
