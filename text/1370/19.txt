I, Gamer
T
wenty-eight hours.
Men have died do-
ing certain things for
that long. Hell, people
have died gaming for
that long. Nevertheless – and I’m
sure most of you are well aware
by now – one plucky World of
Warcraft gamer arranged with
their guild a 28-hour run through
Azeroth that would lead to them
being the first Level 70 player in
the acclaimed MMORPG.
Which, it has to be said, makes
this week’s five-hour shoot
through Hitman: Blood Money
seem less like an epic journey of
killing, and more like a half-hour
saunter on Sunday afternoon. See
what you think of our attempts to
fashion ourselves as serial killers
over the page.
The twenty-eight hour mara-
thon through the best-loved
online world, though, is an im-
pressive feat, especially given
Blizzard’s hopes that the latest
expansion pack, Burning Cru-
sade, would last gamers for an-
other six months or so. It’s an im-
mense effort of co-operation and
timing that allowed the members
of their Guild to protect, support
and aid the now-famous player to
the new level cap.
I doubt it means that we’re
breeding some strain of super-hu-
man who will be able to solve all
of mankind’s future ills through
scaled planning, time manage-
ment and an Archivist Cape of
the Whale. But it shows that they
can actually get something done
when they want to.
This week I stumbled across a
spoof website that parodies Sec-
ond Life, a hugely customisable
MMO. The site, Get A First Life
(http://www.getafirstlife.com/) is
a wry take on the life simulator
that many people give preference
to over their real lives. It might
seem sad to most, but what goes
on in that mini-world is genuinely
impressive.
Stroll through Second Life or
Garry’s Mod, and you’ll see a
lot of complete arseholes. But in
that respect, it’s not a lot different
from real life. Where it differs is
just how much people are willing
to work together in order to have
fun.
Alright, twenty-eight hours is
verging on the obssessive. But as
a hobby, there are far less impres-
sive things you could’ve done. Six
months of gaming in a day?
Sure beats work.

This week in videogaming
I
t’s that time of year when Bill
Gates reviews his to-do list
and realises that he’s due
for another Time Magazine
covershoot. Either that, or
the multi-multi-billion dollar owner
of Microsoft is getting bored of the
poker-face approach to the Console
War.
This week, hot on the tail of Steve
“You Call That Competition? I’ve
Seen Better Products In My Toilet
After A Particularly Colon-Churn-
ing Evening Of Curry” Jobs, Gates
launched a series of speeches, in-
terviews and OK! photo stories in
which he outlined, among other
topics, “Why the PS3 will fail”,
“Why the PS3 won’t win”, and the
ever-popular, “Why everyone will
not buy the PS3”.
It’s not that Gates doesn’t have
reason to smack talk – the XBox 360
is enjoying more and more success,
with LIVE expanding its repertoire
of downloadables and some crucial
game deals being struck – and of
course there’s nothing easier than
kicking Sony when they’re embar-
assed. But it’s beginning to get a lit-
tle boring now.
The media don’t like to let things
go, though, as KDND 107.9 are dis-
covering this week as they first axed
ten of their staff over the death of
a woman in their “Hold Your Wee
For A Wii” contest, and then later
pulled the plug on the unfortunate-
ly-named show that spawned the
contest, The End. The Wii remains
a hugely sought-out product, even
well into the January slump, with
deliveries still being snapped up
in the small hours of the morning.
Hopefully, there won’t be any more
fatalities over it.
Not that we need any more of
those, as Germany seems to be pro-
viding more than enough “Games
= Death” hype, the latest event
being two teenage murders who
unfortunately gave their names as
‘Reno’ and ‘Sephiroth’, two charac-
ters from the RPG Final Fantasy
VII. After making a headline here
or there, the events of the two kids
were used as further fuel to Ger-
many’s ongoing campaign against
violent videogames. As the current
president of the European Union,
The gag in last week’s subhead was SICK SAXIST. Sixaxis. You make me weep
We couldn’t get photos of crazy Final Fantasy fans killing things, so here’s Pullover Weekly’s man of ‘06

Germany is thought to be forming
an EU-wide ban on violent videog-
ames that would potentially cover
everything from Counterstrike to
Lord of the Rings.
Whilst that might be taking things
too far, it is good to see certain steps
being taken to curb the amount of
very young gamers getting their
hands on the bloodier games.
New York State is aiming to pass
a bill that prohibits the sale of vid-
eogames with excessive violence to
anyone under the age of thirty. It’s
unfortunate, but probably a neces-
sary step, until ELSPA and similar
bodies raise awareness and – that
old favourite – people start caring
what they buy their children.
Fortunately, we can still buy
whatever we like over here. Unfor-
tunately, we’re still in the New Year
dry spell. This week, you can pick up
ActionLoop or StarFox Command
for the DS – both good time-wast-
ers, or more questionable license
tie-ins, including Rocky Balboa.
Hmm.
You’re better off looking for the
cheaper thrills, however – 1UP
published a list of the Top 100 free
games off the internet. The list
compiles all manner of genres, with
some genuinely good finds. Find it,
and forget about January.
