Hey, why so glum? At least you’re
not here being Santa at a Christ-
mas party in April. Urk.”
It wasn’t my fault, officer, it went
off in my hand. He threw himself
onto my blade. I was in Wisconsin
at the time. Somehow, it occurred
to me that this wouldn’t stand up in
court. Oh well. I wasn’t planning on
staying in this den of depravity long
enough to get caught, anyway.
I stood there, the enormity of
what I’ve done failing to impact on
my consciousness. In front of me,
his lifeblood seeping into the cracks
between the kitchen tiles, lay a fat
old man in a white-fur-trimmed
red suit. He had a knife stuck gro-
tesquely into his forehead, and I just
stood and watched the crimson pool
spread out from him. Strangely...
dispassionate. I’d just killed Santa.
But morals weren’t really a consid-
eration. So I stripped his whitening,
lifeless body, pulled on his cheerful
and miraculously clean festive suit
stocked up on more kitchen knives,
and went on my way.
Also fated to die that snowy night
were two slickly-suited security
guards, an irritatingly yappy black
terrier, a disgraced senator’s son,
and an aging adult film tycoon. At
that point, though, I didn’t know all
of this. I knew only that I had a job
to do and that a lot of people might
die before it was done. But that was
alright. It was all for the money,
eh?
Massive stainless steel razor-
sharp kitchenware hidden safely in
my garters, which also contained
my emergency survival kit (pass-
port, syringe, three pounds of plas-
tic explosive, silenced pistol, Euros,
the usual), I proceeded inconspicu-
ously in my bright red costume to
my first target. He was on the upper
floor of his mansion, and while none
of the drunken party guests with a
raging libido seemed to care that
a six foot barcoded bald man was
going around in a Father Christ-
mas suit with suspiciously bulging
pockets, the security guards were
less apathetic. Or possibly less dis-
tracted, it’s hard to say. However,
a little creative wardrobe chang-
ing (and one unconscious porno-
graphic photographer) ensured my
passage to the upper levels. I didn’t
stay long. Only long enough to slit
three throats and brutally execute
that annoying canine with a shot to
its head.
Downstairs once again, I slipped
into my morbidly unseasonal get-
up once more, and took to the out-
Cutting it fine
doors, where bikini-clad ‘actresses’
shivered and attempted to enter-
tain my second target, the prodi-
gal son who would never return
to taste the fatted calf. In fact, the
only thing the poor sod was to taste
was the blood in his mouth after my
knife embedded itself into his brain
from ten feet away. In the confusion
that followed, I slipped out, in my
crisp suit once more. No-one would
ever know who was behind the
Christmas Porn Mansion murders.
But I put it behind me. That was in
the past now. I had another half a
dozen hits to carry out in the next
hour and a half, three more cans of
cider, a good supply of gingerbread,
it was dark and I was wearing
sunglasses.
Hit it.
Is that a small explosive device in your pocket?
A redneck wedding – it’s every little
boy’s dream. Fittingly, then, Agent
47 spruces himself up in the clothes
of a drunken southener (America,
not England, obviously. They don’t
drink down there.) and slips his way
inside.
It’s the bride that’s hired us for
today’s job – to take out the groom
and his father and let her get on
with the job of partly-organised
crime. The guards are patrolling,
the ‘gators are in the water, and
the yokels are doing their dancing.
I join in for a little bit, but then get
disturbed at the sight of a bald killer
doing the jive, and move on.
The mansion’s looking pretty spif-
fy. Clean, white panelling, pianos,
alluring guests. The priest is also
looking quite spiffy too, so it’s off to
knock him upside the head and take
his clothes. And his large, hollowed-
out Bible.
His very large Bible, with an inter-
esting compartment in the center.
No-one notices that the priest has
now become considerably more
angry-looking, and has a barcode
tattooed onto the back of his skull.
No-one notices during the ceremo-
ny that I’m cradling a detonator. In
fact, everyone seems pretty uncon-
cerned when the bible is launched
into the congregation, towards the
groom, and explodes violently.
Except the members of the crowd
on fire, who are understandably
irritated.
Most of the hillbillies are running
scared now, the guards don’t know
what’s going on, and the father – lov-
ingly known as ‘Pappy’ – is stagger-
ing around the mansion in shock.
They’re eyeing me up very closely,
but I’m not clear to leave yet, so I
swagger in through the front doors
again and hop upstairs to the attic.
The attic, for some reason, is full
of guards. Not to worry though, they
see priests in lofts all the time, I’m
just exorcising spirits and the like. I
leave a holy remote mine on a con-
secrated chandelier bolt, and then
amble my way downstairs.
They noticed. They take their
time informing me of this, of course,
so by the time I’m standing in the
hallway, watching Pappy stagger
the last steps down the stairs to
the crushing point, everyone in the
room pulls a piece out.
Time freezes momentarily, as the
expression on Pappy’s face chang-
es from sorrow into a mixed anger/
confusion/did-I-get-him-insured
and he steps onto the lower half of
the staircase.
In a beautiful split-second move-
ment, I pull the trigger on the det-
onator, burst out of the door, and
draw my dual Silverballers. Behind
me, the sound of crashing glass
and screaming. In front of me, my
speedboat, and a drunk, naked red-
neck. Action!
Father Christmas, caught in the act of the teapot dance. He won’t be shouting about his spout any more
