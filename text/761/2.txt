Gay Welfare Officer
This week the Welfare Committee has
been distributing a questionnaire
which includes a section on sexuality.
Students are asked to indicate whether
they are actively gay to any extent, or
have a homosexual tendency. Few of
us, if we are honest with ourselves,
would put a tick against
' 'Heterosexual.'' My own entry would
be in the "You have had a sexual
experience with someone of the same
sex" category. This week's letters
column includes criticism ofCouncil's
decision to co-opt Robert Daniels as
Gay and Lesbian Welfare Officer. The
argument that such an officer is
unnecessary does not hold water at
IC, where the "perceived or actual"
attitude of students towards
homosexuality is so retarded. During
the three and a halfyears I have spent
at College I thought there had been
lessening of this paranoid fear of
homosexuals and a move towards
more liberal views. I was saddened
to hear reports that several students
had made abusive comments about the
appointment of a Gay and Lesbian
Welfare Officer. Because such a large
proportion of the student population
are not used to an environment any
less cloistered than the one they
experience at Imperial College, it is
fairly easy to see how this
"homophobic" atmosphere persists.
This is exactly why a Union Officer
is required to look after the interests
of the silent minority of gay students
at IC. If gay students have a higher
profile within the Union they will, in
time, break down ignorance and
prejudice, and this can only be to the
benefit of all of us at Imperial.
were by the boycott of the bars last
year. Last Friday's EGM was not
organised very efficiently, however,
and though I agree that it was
important to gauge thefeeling of the
assembled students, the Executive
should have been betterprepared with
specific proposals.
Hopefully the Union will now be in
a stronger bargaining position to win
some compensation for the loss of
Union space. At the time of writing
the Union Sabbaticals are in a
meeting with the College Secretary to
discuss the issue. We hope to be able
to give details of this in the late news.
Another chance to work
for FELIX
There will be a staffmeeting today at
12.30pm in the FELLX office to
discuss plans for the next issue and
for the rest of term. Please try to come
along and tell us what you think ofthe
newspaper. We shall be trying to find
all thefaults with today's issue, so if
you want to complain, now is the
opportunity.

Goosen
attacked
, '
Dear Editor,
The FELIX interview with Peter
Goosen at South Africa House gave
him a free hand to express the South
African government's point of view.
Having spoken to many South
Africans here in London, I feel it is
necessary to comment on the points
raised.
Firstly, the issue of sanctions.
Goosen argues that sanctions slow
down the pace of reform, since the
government has less money to spend
on areas such as black housing. Yet
15% of the annual budget goes to
defence (compared with Britain,
which spends around 8%). On top of
this, the government maintains an
enormous apparatus for repressing
political activity and enforcing
apartheid, ie the police and prisons.
In 1986 some 40,000 people were
detained, of whom nearly 9,000 are
still in prison. Some economists argue
that South Africa's rate of economic
growth would be 2.5% higher, were
it not for apartheid. The slow pace of
change is due to obstinacy of the
government and not to sanctions.
This brings me to the second point:
the credibility of the South African
government. How can Goosen be
believed when he says that they are
"committed to the abolition of
apartheid" when they continue to
detain and harass thousands of people
who are working for the
establishment of a more democratic
society? When the number of
assassinated or "disappeared" rises
daily? When even children are
detained and tortured? (These
incidents are well documented by
Amnesty International). No
respectable leader in South Africa
supports the goverment's so-called
reforms at present. Even the
government acclaimed leader,
Buthelezi, rejects the new National
Statutory Council.
Finally, for the government to
demand that the ANC must renounce
violence before negotiations can begin
is not a statement of principle, but a
delaying tactic. One of the largest
groups organising within the country,
the U D F , is a non-violent
organisation, yet its members receive
the most brutal treatment at the hands
of police and soldiers. Under what
circumstances will the South African
government be prepared to renounce
violence? Also under what
circumstances will the minority South
African government be prepared to
make a positive step towards creating
and maintaining a more representative
government? In this context, for
Goosen to say that he will be over to
Imperial College "like a shot" sounds
more like a threat than a promise.
Yours sincerely

Appointment
of Officer
Criticised
Dear Dave,
We were shocked to read in FELIX
of the appointment of a Lesbian and
Gay Welfare Officer to Council on
two counts:
a) Christine seems to have assumed
the neccessity of such an officer. Did
she conduct a survey to gauge
students' response or need for this
post? Does she know that homosexual
students want such exposure? Will
they flock to the side of the officer
when there is already an excellent
service provided by them in ULU?
Co-opting an officer before the results
of the College questionnaire are
known is rather shortsighted.
b) If there is a representative for the
minority of sexually different students
then surely Council should have
representatives for the French,
Nigerian and even Welsh members of
College. Surely it is more reasonable
to consider thoughtfully the problems
of each student minority than rush
into trendy-lefty fads without a
mandate either from the homosexuals
or the student body as a whole?
Does this not smack as a kind of
despotism?
Yours Sincerely,
Jason Reese, Physics II,
Stuart Farhead, Physics II,
Saul H-Rowe, Physics II,
G.L. Kennedy, Chemistry II.
QT boycott
unreasonable
Dear Editor,
1 am writing to express my concern
at the result of the 'extraordinary'
UGM on Friday. It was decided to
boycott the QT bar in order to gain
Union control of it. Even though I

It was a relief to see that the boycott
of QT was well supported by students,
and it is significant that College
