Brittan's better Britain
Mr. Leon Brittan, Conservative MP
for Richmond in Yorkshire, spoke to
IC Conservative Society on Tuesday.
Mr. Brittan explained on why he
feels that the fortunes of the
Conservative party are considerably
better now than they were a year ago.
Although the chief reason was that
"We have shown a determination to
seize the initiative", he also said that
the party listened to its supporters,
and cited as an "uncovenanted
bonus'' the ability of the other parties
to score own goals.
In reference to the major
achievements of the Government, Mr.
Brittan said that the new focus on
standards in education shows "a
readiness to deal with difficult
problems," and that it is important for
the Government to tackle the major
issues facing the country.
On inflation, he said that it was not
possible to over-estimate the
achievements that the Government
had made, and told his audience that
battling against inflation is the most
effective way of ensuring stable
growth and job prospects for the
future. The effectiveness of this policy
was, he said, proved by the fact that,
although many jobs have been lost,
more have been created in this
country since 1983 than in any other
European country.
In order to create "one nation" it
was, said Mr. Brittan, necessary to
extend the range of home and share
ownership. He felt that this was of
"profound significance," and
referring specifically to home
ownership said that to pass from a
private housing estate to a council one
was "Division writ large in bricks
and mortar." This monolithic
division could only be overcome by
the policy of selling council houses
to their occupants. Questioned from
the floor, he replied that housing stock
was not lost through such selling, as
only about 3 % of the stock becomes
vacant each year.
Mr. Brittan was also questioned
about the recent ban imposed upon an
article in the New Statesman, and said
that "There will be certain things that
have to be kept secret." It was, he
asserted, in the interest of the country
as a whole that such information was
not made public. It was suggested by
another questioner that, this being the
case, action should have been taken
when the idea for the BBC television
programme was first put forward.
Mr. Brittan countered that although
the Government does take security
matters seriously, it did not wish to
be premature, and gave consideration
to the freedom of the press.
When questioned on the
Government view of student loans,
Mr. Brittan said that he felt that it was
reasonable to look at the option, and
pointed out that Britain is the only
country with a supportive grant
system. With a larger than ever
number of students in higher
education, it was necessary, he
concluded, to examine the alternatives
to the present system.
Re-apps cut by 50%
One hundred and fifty more places in
student accomodation must be found
if next year's planned 20%
undergraduate increase is to be
achieved, according to the Student
Residence Committee, which met last
Wednesday. The extra students are
needed if the College is to receive the
maximum grant from the UGC.
Overseas students, who pay higher
fees, are expected to be encouraged,
although this would increase the
burden on College accomodation.
It was decided by a majority, with
all the students present abstaining, to
reduce the 106 re-app places by 50%
next year, though it is intended to
restore the lost places when a new
residence is found. All wardens agree
that the re-apps are needed, but in
view of the acute accomodation
shortage at the start of this year,
urgent measures must be taken if the
College is to maintain its guarantee
of residence to first year students.
Ken Young, Warden of Southwell
House, said that he feels that cutting
the number of re-app places will cause
a drop in the level of service to
students, with the houses becoming
more like lodgings. Re-apps are, he
told FELIX, vital in helping freshers
to settle in, and cutting the number
of places to the point where there is
only a 1 in 8 chance of succeeding
will dissuade people from applying.
The action, which was proposed by
College Assistant Secretary,Michael
Arthur, is just a way of putting off the
day when a new residence has to be
found, said Mr. Young.
Union President Christine Taig said
that the move was " A desperate
measure." She told FELIX that the
College were cutting off their nose to
spite their face, and said that the
action shows that not enough effort
is being put into finding new
accommodation.
The College is still looking at new
property in the area but, in order to
buy any new accomodation, rents
may have to be increased
significantly, to the point where they
are comparable with the private
sector. Some students have suggested
that College should encourage
benfactors to help buy new property,
perhaps in a sponsorship role, but this
suggestion has not as yet been taken
up.
Schrodinger's
centenary
Imperial College will be leading the
celebrations of the centenary of Erwin
Schrodinger's birth this year. A
conference, featuring six Nobel prize-
winners, is to be held at the College
from March 31st to April 3rd. At the
same time a book containing
contributions from the speakers is to
be published entitled "Schrodinger,
centenary celebrations of a
polymath."
Schrodinger was responsible for the
discovery of wave machines in 1926,
which revolutionised much of
theoretical science in the twentieth
century, including cosmology, unified
field theories, theoretical chemistry
and molecular biology. The speakers
at the conference will include Stephen
Hawking of Cambridge and Linus
Pauling of California.
Prams pushed
for ULU
A total of twelve people turned up
to the "Push for U L U " pram race on
Tuesday, with just four pairs taking
part in the three legged pram race
around the Queens Lawn. The first
place was taken by the team of
Alastair Seymour and Grant Wood of
Elec Eng II, who won a case of Swan
Lager.
ICU President, Christine Taig, said
that further action in support of ULU
may be arranged some time in the
future. The Day of Action was, she
felt, overshadowed by Imperial
College Union's boycott of the QT
Burger Bar.
Writing
Competition
The Economist is offering a student
the chance of three months writing
about science and technology this
Summer.
Students under 24 can apply by
sending a 600 word article suitable for
the science and technology section,

telephone number where the student

Internship), The Economist, 25 St.
James' Street, London SW1A 1HG.
The closing date is 20th February
1987, and applicants should be
prepared for an interview in London
or Boston if required.
