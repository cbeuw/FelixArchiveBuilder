Just as you thought you would never
get through the mid-year blues,
Wellsoc appears with another term of
interesting and entertaining meetings
on Monday nights at 7.30pm in
Physics LT 1.
2nd Feb
Joint film evening with SFsoc and
QTsoc. "Dougal and the Blue Cat"
(the feature length Magic Roundabout

of Life". Free to members of the
societies. Completely unmissable!

Hans Eysenck, world authority on
intelligence and IQ tests, asks "What

16th Feb
Harry Fairbrother speaks on a topic
to be announced. Mr Fairbrother is
an old favourite at Wellsoc with his
somewhat controversial ideas.
23rd Feb

Hero," a topic close to all our hearts!
2nd March
Prof Ian Craft, the inventor of the
test-tube baby technique, will speak
on a topic to be announced.
9th March
Martin S Taylor "Gambling."
You've seen him as a hypnotist,
you've seen him as a magician, but
did you know that he has invented a
system for winning at Blackjack? All
will be revealed later.
16th March
Annual Dinner. What better way to
wind up the term than by attending
the ever-popular Wellsoc night out?
If you can't remember all this,
DON'T PANIC. Our newsletter
'Scraps' will be appearing shortly and
will contain this timetable and more
besides.
In the drink
The first match of term started when
we had to drag one of the team
members, Adam Stork, out of bed
before proceeding on our way to
Queen Mary's Reservoir to sail
against "City."
We arrived there to find fog and
very little wind, but after a quick cup
of coffee, while we surveyed the
situation, we decided to brave the
elements, or lack of them!
During the first race Charles Oxley
thought it would be a good tactic to
capsize on top of a buoy (lucky boy!),
go for a swim and half drown one of
the opposition. Despite the disastrous
start, better known as lulling the
opposition into a false sense of
security, the IC team went on to win
an astounding race with an excellent
1st, 2nd, 3rd finish leaving City
wading behind in 4th, 5th, 6th place.
• The next race was extremely close
with Adam Stork and Jenny Highgate
chasing the first boat while Richard
Brimelow and Sam Page slowed
down to help Charles Oxley through,
who then proceeded to stop a City
boat from finishing for ten minutes
after the other boats had finished.
During this time the other boats
adjourned to the bar to watch the end
of the race—closely followed by the
crew!
Just rewards
Scored
After a win and a draw in early term
friendlies, the 1st XI returned to
competitive hockey last Wednesday
against Charing Cross/Westminster
on Paddington astroturf. IC took the
lead when Paul Coleman converted a
short corner early in the game. This
was swiftly followed by Dave
Jennings scoring a second after a
goalmouth scramble. Further pressure
in the first half failed to produce any
more goals, although there was a
good case for a penalty flick award
when the ball struck a defender's foot
on the goal line. Midway through the
second half, Jon Stonham burst
through from defence and left with
only the goalkeeper to beat, slipped
it just inside the post. Paul Henharon
then drew on his many years of
experience to round the keeper for the
fourth goal to leave the final score at
4-0.
On Saturday, in the Middlesex
League, we travelled to Brunei
University. A somewhat late
departure resulted in the team having
to change on the Tube much to the
shock and amusement of some
passengers. The late start did not
prevent us taking the lead through
Paul Skipworth with a cooly taken
goal on reverse stick. Brunei replied
almost immediately with a shot that
gave birthday boy Phil Choudhury no
chance. The loss of Phil Oliver at half
time with a shoulder injury resulted
in a tactical reshuffle; however, Hari
scored a well-taken goal to restore the
lead. The play then became rather
scrappy although Brendan Farmer had
two good chances to wrap the game
up. Brunei piled on the pressure in the
closing stages but the defence, Phil
Choudhury in particular, held out
well to leave IC with the points.
IC 4 : Charing Cross/
Westminster Hosp 0
Brunei 1 : IC 2
London Hospital II 0 : IC II 1
Opportunism by Scott Gordon in the
87th minute brought an expression of
delight to this IC team, as his header
found the back of the net. For IC it
brought a fine conclusion to an
excellent, hard fought game of
football.
However, the game started poorly
for IC, who were fielding 4 players.
Making their debut for the II's, viz
Holroyd, Robinson, Poppy and
Broelhuizen. London Hospital passed
the ball around gracefully in the
opening 20 minutes and a couple of
chances were squandered. As the
game wore on, the IC midfield of
Keelin, Adams and co became more
involved. Keelin's free-kick found the
head of Gordon and an.excellent save
was required from the London
Hospital keeper. Good work by
Keelin and Poppy led to a Keelin
cross being met '.superbly by Phil
Adams, whose effort deserved more
than the rattle of the post.
At half-time IC reckoned
themselves to have taken the upper
hand in the game. Yet once again
London Hospital looked dangerous in
the opening moments of the half. IC
battled on with Holland and Caverick
(the IC centrebacks) endorsing "no-
nonsense" tactics. The game became
a spectacle of end-to-end action
(where were the cameras?) and a
mistake by anyone could have proved
costly. John Wreford, who gave
another exceller.. performance in the
IC goal, made such a mistake when
he missed a relatively simple cross.
A London Hospital goal looked
certain as the shot headed towards the
empty goal. But Barrow the IC
skipper was on hand to make a
dramatic clearance three inches from
the line, thus saving the day once
more for IC. The battle wore on and
both teams looked tired, only London
Hospital more so. Fine work by the
midfield gave Poppy the opportunity
to cross. Broelhuizen harassed the
defence enough for the miscued
clearance to fall to Adams whose
excellent effort was again foiled by
the keeper. Keelin came blistering
through and his follow up shot was
deflected to Gordon who duly headed
home. Just rewards for a fine effort
by this makeshift side.
