Imperial's longest running serial
crawls back for another episode!
OF V
CHEAPSKATE
"How silly I am" thought Derek
Dash, Cheapskate's new Baron, as he
sat in a corner of the citizens'
playground, scrubbing the floor. As
usual Derek's habit of talking too
much had got him into trouble. Last
week there had been a big meeting of
all the citizens, who were very angry
because John Secretary had built the
"Quite Tasty" burger factory in the
middle of their playground. Ms
Plague and Mummylonglegs had been
arguing with Derek and John
Secretary for weeks, but the only
result of all their complaining was for
Derek to fall asleep and John
Secretary to change the angle at which
he held his head. Ms Plague had
called all the citizens together so that
they could all shout at Derek. Derek
had avoided all their questions very
carefully. Whenever one of the
citizens asked him something
difficult, such as what his job was, he.
would say "that's a very good
question, and I think that John
Secretary would like to say something
about it." Then John Secretary would
always reply "I think that what we
have to remember is that Arthur
Michael buys his clothes from Marks
and Spencer." Normally this worked
very well and all the citizens would
look confused and suck their thumbs,
except for Minty, the citizen's Rug
Chairman who kept trying to do an
impression of Bruce Springsteen.
Unfortunately, when one of the
citizens asked if anyone was going to
clear up ?.ll the litter around the burger
factory, Derek decided to answer the
question himself, and suggested that
there should be a cleaning rota on
which he would take first turn. Now
Derek felt especially silly because he
was clearing up litter from the
citizens' picnic, rather than from the
burger factory. The citizens had
decided not to buy anything from the
"Quite Tasty" factory until they were
allowed to play in the factory
themselves. The citizens all thought
this was very fair since the factory
was in the middle of their playground.
Cheapskate's chief cook, McNorthey
was very cross, however. His burger
factory had been very successful and
lots of citizens had bought burgers
from him. Now he had nothing to do
all day except sit in his office sulking.
At the same time, on the other side
of Cheapskate, the new Rent
Collector, Lesley Grievous Bodily
Harm was sitting in her office licking
lots of envelopes. She was sending all
the citizens Â« very useful piece of
paper, which had lots of questions on
it invented by Kettle and GMT, the
citizens' wellfeeling representative.
Lesley was pleased with her new job;
now she would be able to make sure
that even more of her friends would
be given rooms in Cheapskate's
dormitories.
Elsewhere in Cheapskate, however,
the former Rent Collector, Dong, was
feeling sorry for himself. Dong had
been banished to one of the Surefield
dungeons by the Baron. He now had
a job playing space invaders all day
in the Cheapskate Treasury, and after
three weeks of this he was beginning
to think that it was rather boring. He
was even beginning to suspect that
John Secretary had only wanted to
stop him trying to do anything
important. Dong sighed and carried
on playing space invaders; at least in
this job he didn't have to put up with
Arthur Michael poking his nose in all
the time. He decided to phone his
friend, Paralytic, who had also been
moved from the Rent Collectors
office and was now working 3 floors
above Dong. Paralytic was out,
however, because he had gone to
watch a meeting of the all-powerful
citizen's committee. Paralytic had
once been an important citizen, but
since then he had been working for
the Baron. As usual, as at all meetings
of the citizens' committee, the
Chairman, Bigbum was trying to stop
Why gate from talking. Why gate
always tried to say something at least
once every two minutes so that
nobody would forget he was there.
Whygate thought that this was a good
way to become head citizen, but in
fact all the representatives just wanted
him to be quiet.
"I don't know if this is the right
place to say this," Whygate was
saying, "but if it isn't it won't matter
as I haven't got anything to say."
"I think we're going round in
circles" said Bigbum, trying to keep
the meeting under control and groping
Mummylonglegs' knee at the same
time.
"What we have to do," went on
Whygate, "is to make sure that we
agree with my ideas, whenever I think
of any."
"I think we're going round in
circles" said Bigbum.
"What about the burger factory,"
said Ms Plague.
"I think that what we have to
remember is that Arthur Michael buys
his clothes from Mark's and Spencer,"
said Whygate, always ready to see the
other side's point of view.
"I think we're going round in
circles," said Bigbum.
"I want to go out to dinner with
Anne Diamond," said Minty.
"Shut up," said Bigbum.
"No taxation without represen-
tation," said Whygate, certain that
two minutes had elapsed.
"I used to work at Pontin's," piped
up Alan Ego, anxious to put forward
a nice-guy image before the citizens
had their elections.
In one corner of the room someone
started snoring. It was Custard, who
had come to the meeting to get out of
the FALLIX office, where he was
always ordered to sweep up. Custard
decided to keep a low profile for a
while, so he escaped from the
FALLIX office and went to the
citizens' committee meeting to let his
Christmas dinner settle down. The
constant prattle from Whygate had
made him sleepy, however, and he
began to doze...
Will Custard wake up?
Will Whygate stop talking?
Will Dong beat the space invaders?
Will Arthur Michael go to C&A ?
Find out in the next installment of
"The Baron of Cheapskate.'
