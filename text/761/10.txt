Every year the Christian societies
combine to bring a group of vicars,
priests, monks, nuns, and other
assorted Christians to spend a week
in the College. You can find them at
the workshops, or at less formal
occasions round the halls. This is
your chance to find out all you ever
wanted to know about the spiritual
life, but didn't know who to ask.
You will see from their mini-
biographies they are an interesting
bunch of people to talk to, and
that's what they are here for. And
it's quite safe; at the end of the week
they all go away and you won't be
contacted again...unless, of course
that is what you ask for.
