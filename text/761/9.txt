Reviews FELIX, Friday January 30th 1987 9
Philip Barry's "Holiday" is a very
curious play to be revived in
London. It belongs to an almost
extinct genre: the comedy of
manners or alternatively, 'scenes
from an upper-class drawing room'.
This type of play once occupied
every stage on Broadway and in
London but is hardly fashionable
today.
Yet at the Old Vic we find a cast
containing some very famous faces
which would indicate a certain
seriousness to the venture. What
happens is disappointing.
Imagine yourself as an observer for
a night in a road in the North of
England, suffering under the impact
of total unemployment. You catch
glimpses of people's lives as scenes
appear then melt away, hear their
conversation, witness their
relationships, lives and even deaths.
They cover all their disillusionment,
hopelessness and sadness with a
poignant, painful sadness. You are
involved; they speak to you, scream
at you and even dance at you. but you
are free to move away.
"Road" at the Royal Court (until
28th February) allows you to become
a fly-on-the-wall for an evening. It is
total theatrical escapism, the action
continues even during the interval in
the audience, whilst in the theatre's
real bar, we are entertained by the
cabaret acts from the pub on the road,
one of which is a song from Ian Dury.
All aspects of the production fit
together and work perfectly, however
"Road" gains extra lift from the
genuine enjoyment the actors get from
performing to and interacting with the
audience, to whom their enthusiasm
is quickly transmitted.
"Road" has been described as the
most significant and original new
English play for a long time. It is
thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying,
and totally unmissable!
The plot is an old cliche
containing a rich, established
A m e r i c a n family and the
unconventional bright young man
who arrives to marry the eldest
daughter, but has a profound effect
on the whole household,
particularly the rebellious younger
sister.
What happens is painfully
predictable - there is no element of
intrigue. Neither do we find much in
the way of interesting characters -
they are all stereotypes, after all this
is a comedy of manners.
But where we should find
abundant observations on the
foibles of the rich and social
hierarchy we find but few. A few
pleasing mordant one-liners
perhaps, but on the whole nothing
really happening. The humour
involved is of course very subtle,
intelligent humour and I think the
Old Vic fails here as a venue because
its cavernous stage does not allow
the intimacy subtle humourous
interplay requires.
Yet there were performances
from some of the actors that could
have sparked off greater things on a
different night or at a different
place. Mary Steenburgen brought
great impetuousness, high spirits
and a caustic wit to the young sister,
who yearns for the freedom and
happiness her 5th Avenue mansion
does not allow. Frank Grimes was
excellent as the brother who finds
solace in alcoholism. In a tame
production they stood out. Malcom
M c D o w e l l was the most
disappointing actor. He is supposed
to be the breath of life who sweeps
into the staid household, but he does
not convey this. I expected more
from him.
'Holiday' is hardly Tenessee
Williams - not drama. There is a
little of Scott Fitzgerald in the
inclination of the run towards
disillusion and the breathless desire
for youth, fun and party. But this is
really Philip Barry, a man
simultaneously repelled by the rich
and compelled to live amongst
them. His characters display the
personal and moral confusions of
the age (the 20's) and see freedom
lying far away from wealth and
social status and equally far away
from poverty. One doubts they will
ever find. it.
I would not write this play off. A
fortnight may transform it for the
better and the light story is not
altogether unpleasent as an
alternative to full-blooded British
farce. But it's very existence in
London seems curious.
