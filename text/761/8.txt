o w n & O u t in London
Within easy reach of Imperial,
frequented by millions of people
every year, and yet almost ignored by
most students, are the four great
museums of South Kensington. The
Natural History, Science, Geological
and Victoria and Albert Museums are
not squeezed into this small area by
chance. Nor does Imperial share this
space with them by chance. It was due
to the efforts of Albert, Prince
Consort, Queen Victoria's husband,
who purchased the space to be used
for great institutes of learning. The
area remains crown property,
watched over by the far sighted
German from his memorial in
Kensington Gardens.
Students of Science should not think
that a visit to these museums would
be like a busman's holiday, or that a
trip to the V and A would be of no
interest. All four museums are rich
treasure houses, even if government
underfunding does mean that they
have changed very little over the
course of several years. The great
variety of exhibits, and enjoyable
interactive displays, means that the
days of standing looking blankly at
display cases filled with stuffed
animals or random pieces of
machinery, with brief and
uninteresting labels, are long since
gone. True, they may still be found,
but for the most part they have been
banished to the more remote galleries,
where only the adventurous will track
them down.
The Science Museum was
originally part of the V and A. which
housed the exhibits from The Great
Exhibition of 1851. It became a
separate entity in 1909. The ground
floor of the museum has been
extensively refurbished. The new
Synopsis Gallery is a museum in its
own right. The last 150 years of
science dominate the gallery. There
are mini displays on the train,
telephone and wireless and many
other technological advances that
have radically altered the world.
Tucked away on the top floor of the
museum is one of its gems. The
Wellcome Museum of Medicine
contains not only a chamber of
medical horrors through the ages, but
modern advances as well. 'Mr
Gibson's Chemist Shop' is an
immaculately reproduced 1903
chemists, full of patent medicines and
Victoriana. In the basement of the
museum is a perennial favourite, the
Children's Gallery, where a student
may while away the time playing with
the displays and indulging their
childish tendencies. The Science
Museum is probably the best of the
four museums, and well worth a visit.
The Natural History Museum
(more correctly British Museum
(Natural History)) is full of plundered
specimens from around the world, in
the same way as its mother museum.
It has recently overcome the dusty
cabinets and stuffed animal image.
The human biology exhibition is
excellent. It is a marvellous guided
tour around the body. The only thing
which detracts from this is the small
children sniggering at the 'naughty
bits' at the beginning of the
exhibition. Particulary good is the
section on perception, with some
interesting tests, which a sober headed
student may just be able to complete.
Another revamped area is the
dinosaur display. Gone are the bare
bones, and in are reconstructed
dinosaurs.
The recently cleansed Geological
Museum is sadly in need of a pepping
up, but there's not really a lot you can
do with rocks. The newest and the
best exhibition is a 5,000 million year
history of the earth from a geological
viewpoint. Highpoint of this is the
Earthquake film show, watched from
a platform, which at the appropriate
moments bursts into shuddering life
to simulate the great Alaska
earthquake. This exhibition also
contains what is probably your only
chance to get a look at the moon
close-to, in the form of a genuine
piece of moon rock. Many of the
other exhibits are best summed up as
colourful bits of rock, but many are
entirely uninteresting pieces of rock.
I'm sure the miners will love it.
The Victoria and Albert Museum
is a hotch potch of design history,
fashion art and the like. It is another
collection of the booty of Empire.
Much of the layout is designed to
show you the objects and little more
can be said. The historical aspects of
design which are displayed are of
particular note, and the museum
contains many bits of buildings
lopped off whole for the exhibition.
Fabric and cloth design make for
colourful displays, as does the
assorted and fascinating field of
commercial art. This is definitely a
museum for those scientists with an
artistic leaning, and I wouldn't
pretend that it will hold interest for
all.
All four museums are currently
free, although the V and A does have
an optional donation system. If you
put on a student scarf the likelihood
is that they won't hassle you for a
donation at the V and A , but if they
do, don't feel in the slightest obliged
to cough up. However, minimum
charges are being introduced in April.
Up until then, the museums offer a
warm, dry, constructive way to while
away a free afternoon without being
too energetic.
It would be a shame to pass up the
opportunity to make the most of them
when they are so easily accessible.
