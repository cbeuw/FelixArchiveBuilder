Clubs. FELIX, Friday January 30th 1987 1 2
Go, and wine Ales
There was a good turnout last Friday
to hear the Head Brewer from Gales
Brewery give an informal talk to
members of the society. Discussion
ranged from the beers and lagers on
Due to the overwhelming response
from our last little ditty in this
esteemed rag we have decided to
make the trek to Maths 341 a little
more enticing than merely knowing
about the great games played in this
room during Tuesday and Wednesday
lunchtimes (viz Hsiangchi and Go).
Yes, we've spared no expense to lay
on a special cheese & wine party on
Wednesday February 4th starting at
1.00pm in Maths 341. Just to
complete the party atmosphere we'll
introduce new people to the games
played by the club, which, in case you
missed the last instalment, are
strategy-war games for two players.
Hsiangchi is similar to chess, and Go
isn't!
Unlike most strategy games, these
two are easy to learn, so don't be put
off by the thought of spending hours
learning rules—you'll be playing from
scratch within ten minutes, and while
I'm on the subject of being put off,
our club name has caused a little
confusion: the word 'Chinese' refers
to the brand of chess played, and not
what you have to be in order to join!
So come along on the 4th and find out
how to play two of the most
fascinating games in the world. See
you there.
SFSoc flights of fancy
the market today, their histories, and
thoughts about the future of the
industry, to pigs getting pissed every
Thursday on fermented by-products
of the brewing process. There was a
chance to discuss the possibility of a
career in brewing for those interested.
Our next meeting is on Thursday
6th February, and there are also
spaces on some of the brewery trips
we have organised for this term.

I hurriedly pushed my way through
the market crowds seeking the tiny
booth on the far side. The odour of
a thousand unwashed bodies assailed
my nostrils, and the shouting of
customers and stall owners drowned
out the meaning of their words. It was
not long until the market closed for
the night, and already many people
were heading for the exits, so much
so that I was fighting against the tide
of humanity driving me away from
my destination. I received several
bruises and crushed toes in my
search, but I was sure I gave as many
injuries as I got.
Finally, scant minutes before the
market was due to be cleared of
customers by the palace guard, I saw
my destination in front of me. That
tiny little tent made from what seemed
to be an ancient tapestry, with the
faded images of heraldic beasts
sporting in a verdant landscape. I
went to the entrance and stepped
through the beaded doorway into the
dimly lit interior.
The difference between the outside
and the inside of the booth always
astounded me. Was it the lighting that
made the inside seem larger, the
tapestries brighter in colour and not
so decrepit with age, or because the
interior was simply better cared for?
I always got the feeling that neither
of these explanations was true.
The sole occupant of the booth
looked up at me from her table. The
blind milky eyes of the old hag looked
straight into my face. "So you have
returned. Have you the money this
time?"
"Yes," I replied, placing the
leather purse I had been carrying on
the table. The woman picked it up and
weighed the contents in her hand.
"You have done well. This is
almost twice what I asked for."
"You don't ask how much a man
is carrying when you cut his purse,"
I replied.
"That is true. Now sit and I will
tell you what you would know." I did
as I was told. "I have conducted
many readings for you since I knew
you would bring me the money. You
will go to the great magician Enas
Yorl, who will send you on your way.
You will travel to a great seat of
learning, via a most mysterious
journey on which his magic will send
you. There you will join with a great
conspiracy, and on a most significant
date many will gather at one place
where the Meaning of Life will be
revealed to all. I have prepared this
parchment for you with many details
of your trip. Do not lose it, for it
holds your very fate within its secrets.
Now go to the Old City, where Enas
Yorl is expecting you." I grasped the
roll of parchment and left the tent.
And so I came to be here, seated
in this great hall with so many others
about to have revealed to us the real
Meaning of Life. The lights dimmed
and a great series of visions formed
before my eyes. Truly this could not
be the secret itself?
Strangely unedifed, I left the hall
many hours later and consulted the
fortune teller's parchment, my only
companion on my long and tortuous
journey.
The mystic runes seemed to glow
on the page as I read them...
"ICSF in association with QTSoc
and WellSoc present a film evening
in Physics LT1 on Monday 2nd
February at 6.30pm
The films will be Dougal and the
Blue Cat, the only full length Magic
Roundabout film ever made, and
Monty Python'S The Meaning of Life.
Entrance is free to members of the 3
societies, and £1 to non-members."
These words seemed of obvious
meaning to me, so the last few
syllables must contain the reason for
my mistake, and I was still pondering
their meaning as I read them...
"Time for bed" said Zebedee,
"Boinnnggg"

Enviroweek
The EEC has designated March 21st
1987 as the beginning of the
'European Year of the Environ-
ment' (EYE).
The community's aim is to 'raise
awareness of the environment and
to provide environmental projects
which will have lasting effects.
In response to this large scale
international initiative several
societies within the college are
working together to hold an
'Enviroweek' between March 2nd
and 6th this year.
The aims of the week are similar
to those of EYE; to raise awareness
in a college where much of the
teaching and research carried out is
connected, directly or indirectly,
with the environment. Throughout
the week some emphasis will be
given to the possibilities opening up
in the 'environment friendly'
technologies, for example
renewable energy.
Several events are already
planned, these include stalls,
displays and videos, however we are
still looking for ideas.
If you have any thoughts on the
matter, know of relevant contacts or
would like to help out in any way,
then please contact Theresa Lisher
or Stuart McFarlane via the MSc
pigeon holes at the Centre for
Environmental Technology 48
Prince's Gardens (between Mech.
Eng. and Southside) or by leaving a
message on 7214 internal.
Short meetings to discuss the
project will be held in the centre at
12.50pm every Monday and
Tuesday, between now and March.
Cocooned
IC Film Society's next presentation,
this Thursday February 5th in Physics
LT1 (doors 7.30pm) is Cocoon
(1985) directed by Richard D Zanuck
(Jaws).
When a group of aliens arrive on
earth to rescue their colleagues from
a mission 10,000 years ago, a group
of local old age pensioners discover
that the visitors have access to a
special life-rejuvenating force.
The film is made by Don Ameche
and his friends cracking great one-
liners, and some dazzling award-
winning effects. It is also a gentle
exploration, with some laughs along
the way, of the very human desire to
remain forever young.
Next Thursday FilmSoc is showing
The Hitcher, a violent but very
effective thriller.
50p members, £1.00 non-members,
membership available.
