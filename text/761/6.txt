Heliconic Hassles
Grapyathos was a young, up and
coming Greek intellectual of the 6th
Century BC. Like similar smart-arses
of that time he was hoping to join
Pythagoras' Brotherhood of ascetics,
who spent their time contemplating
obscure mathematical concepts.
Accordingly he was given an
interview by the infamous
Pythagoras.
"You're aware of my latest
theorem?" Asked Pythagoras.
"You mean that which relates the
areas formed by squares on the sides
of the right triangle?" Said Grapy,
who'd done his homework.
"Yes, can you tell me what it is?"
Grapyathos, who always read his
Ancient Greek Mathematica Weekly,
answered without hesitation.
"It states: the sum of the areas
formed by squares on the two short
sides of the right triangle equals the
area of the square on the longest
side."
"Very good," said Pythagoras,
you'll see that here I've written out
a few whole number solutiions!
He pointed to a patch of ground
where he had scratched out the
following.
3 4 5
6 8 10
7 24 25
"Notice that in every case one of
the numbers is a multiple of 5!"
" A coincidence?" offered
Grapyathos.
"If you were aware of our
teachings that the universe is merely
a manifestation of mathematical
relationships, you'd know that there
is no such thing as coincidence. In fact
it is true in every single case that one
of the numbers is divisible by five,
and I want you to prove it!"
Grapyathos was puzzled, but then
realised that it was actually very easy
to prove. How?

More groping—solution
OK, so my description did not rule
out cutting the orchard into 8 strips-
sorry. You all got the gist of what I
wanted, though, with the following 4
piece solution:
The winner of the £5 prize was Paul
Claydon, Aero 4, well done. Please
collect your prize after 1.00pm on
