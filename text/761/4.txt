Bad planning
at Evelyn
view over the matter, I don't think
this is a reasonable solution. The
important grievances to the Union
seem to be the loss of space in the
JCR, the loss of revenue through
letting out the JCR in the summer and;
the fact that the College refectory
service doesn't clear up the mess it
produces. Surely any reasonable
person would aim for these
consequences of the College's
unthoughtful judgements to be cleared
up, eg. by boycotting the bar in order
to ensure the seating area for the QT
bar is not installed, to gain
recompensation for the summer losses
and to get a clearing-up service. Why
on earth does the fact the College
installs a new profitable refectory
service give the Union the right to
take it over? It seems to me the
College refectory service is
improving and that it is still striving
to do so. If, every time it installs a
new service which is profitable, the
Union take it over what incentive does.
it leave the refectory service to
continue improving?
This, what I believe to be an error
in the Union's judgement, seems to
have arisen from many bad feelings
between the College Secretary and the
Union Executive. I don't believe that
there are good reasons for these bad1
feelings, but this shouldn't cloud the
judgement of an important issue, i
Meanwhile, many people are getting
fed up with feeling obliged not to eat j
from the QT bar, and drinking poor j
coffee for the same price as the
excellent coffee from the newly
installed coffee machines. With the
Union demands as they stand at the
moment, this dispute looks like it will,
rim for a very long time.
Yours sincerely

Dear Dave,
I am writing in order to provide a
student's eye view of the proposed
changes to Evelyn Gardens. The first
change is to let-out the Gardens in
order to generate some money for
more halls. Although this seems like
a good idea in theory, it means the
moving-out of all students from their
rooms, and provides the interesting
question of security; even if the
allocated storerooms have deadlocks
fitted, the door-frames, windows and
balconies are readily accessible and
hardly of Fort-Knox standard. The
attic, certainly in Bernard Sunley, can
be filled with the contents of one
double room. Clearly, this needs
much more thought. Who knows?
College may even consider asking (or
telling) the residents.
A second point, much more
sweeping than the first, is the
proposed cutting back of the Re-
Apps. As a fresher, I appreciated the
efforts of the Re-Apps to acclimatise
us to London. This included
recommending various pubs, shops,
where to go and what to do at IC, and
how to actually find your way about
London. As a fresher, I can
appreciate these efforts on my behalf.
As a Re-App, I can appreciate the
hard work that we sometimes have to
do in order to organise such events
as ARBS, competitions, etc. In
addition, students must be shown
around the local area: half of the first
week went towards this. In summary,
if College has any desire to keep our
unique attitude of giving Freshers an
idea of what there is to do around
London and IC, it would seem more
reasonable to keep the proportion of
Re-Apps roughly constant, or tell
prospective Re-Apps exactly how
much work they will have to do.-And
then, of course, try to work out why
there are no applicants.
Yours Sincerely,
Ian Baker,
Mech. Eng. 2.
BOYCOTT SUCCESS
The boycott of the 'QT' snack bar has
been a resounding success. The
students of this college have made
their feelings over the control of the
Junior Common Room absolutely
clear. The Union Executive can now
negotiate with College knowing that
you are behind us.
The boycott will cease from
4.30pm this evening. It was never
intended to do permanent damage, but
it was necessary to show that we have
your support. College must now listen
to the student viewpoint.
On Wednesday, notices signed by
the Refectory Manager (Mr. Northey)
appeared in the Junior Common
Room. These implied that, during the
first two days of the picket, 'QT' staff
and customers had been "harassed"
by students picketting the burger bar.
We believe that this is not the case,
and have had no complaints about the
conduct of the pickets. In fact the
pickets were polite and friendly to
both staff and students throughout the
boycott.
We would like to thank everybody
who helped to organise the boycott
and all those, students and staff, who
supported the Student Union by
staying away from 'QT'. Special
thanks are due to all the Union
permanent staff for their enthusiasm
and all the extra work they have put
in this week.
JCR REFURBISHMENT
Work started on Wednesday on the
refurbishment of the Junior Common
Room. This involves total
redecoration, the installation of a
moveable partition, and a new ceiling
and lights. Approximately half the
JCR space will be cordonned off until
March 15th when all work should be
complete. There will be access to the
remainder of the JCR and the buttery
area at all times. Events which had
been booked into the JCR will be
rehoused, probably in the main
Dining Hall. If this is likely to cause
your club problems, see Jackie Pierce
as soon as possible.
This work, which is being financed
by College, is part of long-term
refurbishment plans. The Union
Executive agreed with some
reservations to the work proceeding
during the Spring term. We realise
that it will cause some inconveience,
but felt that students would have lost
out in the long run if we had not
agreed to the work going ahead as
planned. After Easter, the Junior
Common Room will, at last, live up
tq its name.
