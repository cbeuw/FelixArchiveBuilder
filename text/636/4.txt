Tea for Two Hundred
To whom it may concern, namely
the Beit tea room invaders!
We realise that the tea and
coffee served in Beit is the
tastiest and cheapest in College;
hence the reason for the recent
invasion of our cosy tea room by
students from other departments.
However, this overcrowding has
made it difficult, and sometimes
impossible, to obtain the vital
refreshment necessary to sustain
us between enthralling lectures
and exciting practicals!
Instead of pushing us out of
our tea room why can't these
students push the appropriate
people to provide them with a
similar service?
Yours thirstily

Reel Cock-up
Dear Sir
I feel the urge to write this
letter as I notice that one of the
main contributors to IC's extra-
academic culture is unfor-
tunately seldom mentioned on
F E L I X . As you might easily
guess, I am referring to IC Ents.
I was so ever so pleased noticing
that this year Ents have defin-
itely headed in the right direc-
tions towards p r o v i d i n g an
intelligent alternative to normal
cinema.
My hopes began to grow when
they presented their alternative
version of 'Psycho', in which
they added incredibly to the
suspense by making the audience
guess what was h a p p e n i n g
through half of the first reel,
while the screen became filled
with psychedelic flickers of light
and the soundtrack went three
octaves lower. Such hopes were
definitely confirmed last Thurs-
day night, when mystery and
philosophy were enhanced as
never before by showing the
second and third reel of The Tin
drum in inverse order. I was I
simply delighted.
I hope there is room for '

further development along the
new path taken by Ents. A few
suggestions could be: a session
on Eisenstein's films shown
backwards, a 'mix up' consisting
of images of Fellini's Casanova
with the soundtrack of Hair and,
for the real c o n n o i s s e u r s ,
Apocalypse Now shown with the
projector's light switched off.

Sensationalist STOIC
Dear Martin
After reading the letters in this
week's F E L I X concerning the
abortive rent strike at Bernard
Sunley House I feel that as a
resident I must redress the
balance by defending P a u l
Simion from certain S T O I C
hacks who appear to be resort-
ing to rather belated sensational-
ism in scraping up a news story.
Bernard Sunley House is
relatively poorly equipped in
terms of social facilities as well
as being in a less than perfect
state o f general repair (eg
cookers with no control knobs
and lavatory doors which won't
shut). As a result it is fair to say
that most of the residents believe
there is a lot of r o o m for
improvement. Consequently a
g r o u p of residents left M r
Simion to investigate whether a
rent strike was practical and
likely to do any good. The
ensuing events were as accurate-
ly reported in the January 28th
F E L I X . It was felt unnecessary
and compromising to involve the
warden before any possible
strike. Unfortunately the whole
affair has been blow out of
proportion.
The state of the house is in no
way Nick Campbell's fault and
he is a popular warden. I must
also point out that M r Simion is
not the only person in this case
with other interests. I hope all
the bitching (oops sexist!) will
now cease and house committees
can do something more positive
than write grovelling letters, to
w h i c h i n c i d e n t a l l y not a l l
interested persons were party.
Yours
Mark Cottle
Resident of Bernard Sunley
PS: If anyone makes insinua-
tions about this letter, I will
stand against Paul Simion for
ICU President.
Kevan Reeve
Dear Mr Taylor
I thought I should write
because an accident was re-
ported in the last copy of F E L I X
in which the information was
somewhat exaggerated. I have
not had a chance to investigate
•imamKmaMmUMiM Februa
the matter fully but I understand
from the Chemistry department
that Kevan Reeve will not lose
the sight of one eye, and this was
known by Wednesday.
My main concern, as Safety
Director, is that certain acci-
dents, of which the loss of one
eye is included, are notifiable to
the Health and Safety Executive.
Failure to do so could lead to
a serious situation. I would ask
you, therefore (as you did over
the asbestos problem) to contact
me, or the department con-
cerned, to check on some of the
facts since they tend to be
exaggerated by word of mouth.
It is a report of this nature which
led me to investigate the accident
only to find that it was rather
exaggerated.
Yours sincerely
Dr G Hargreaves
Safety Director
Inconsistent Hack
Dear Sir
I am writing to complain
about the inconsistent behaviour
of certain I C U Hacks, most
notably our glorious president.
Recently, posters for the
notorious Mines Review were
banned. About two months ago,
certain (totally different) posters
put up by the Islamic Society
were removed.
The former banning took
place only after several days of
vociferous protest by a large
body of opinion.
As. for the latter: the posters
were put up as part of the
Human Rights Fair. They were
part of a poster display in
conjunction with a bookstall. No
one complained to the Islamic
Society about the posters, or
indeed even mentioned them, yet
an hour after they were put up
M r G o u l d e r appeared and
without a word of explanation,
calmly removed the posters and
walked off again.
I believe this shows he is guilty
at best of bias, and at worst of
the deliberate suppression of a
viewpoint.
I put it to you that if someone
in the position of Union Presi-
dent is incapable of acting
responsibly he can be replaced.
Yours faithfully

And Finally
Dear Martin
I would like to say a few more
things about pornography in
general, and the Mines Review in
particular.
Geena McKay, in her letter to
F E L I X last week, said she found
the Review neither offensive,
disgusting, degrading or porno-
ry 11,19831
graphic, nor did any of the other
girls she spoke to. This is hardly
surprising, since most of the
women at the Mines Review
would be expected to have the
same opinion, otherwise they
wouldn't have gone. It has been
said that the p r o p o r t i o n of
women present roughly equalled
the proportion of women at
Imperial College, but to me it
was fairly obvious at the U G M
that few women voted against
the motion (banning porno-
graphic events on Union pre-
mises) whereas many women
voted for it. Geena could not see
how I could possibly categori-
cally state what is offensive to
women. Quite simply, I can do
so because many women have
told me that p o r n o g r a p h y
offends them.
Now about this liberty argu-
ment. Even in liberal Western
society our freedoms are limited:
generally we are free to do what
we like, but not to the extent of
• encroaching on other people's
freedoms. The test of a repre-
sentative system concerns the
extent to which it affords
protection to its weaker parts
against its stronger or more
irresponsible parts. For example,
we are not free to carry hand-
guns, to drive under the influ-
ence of alcohol, or to abstain
from paying taxes. Against the
freedom of the Royal School of
Mines to sponsor pornographic
events, and exploit women's
bodies for publicity purposes,
should be set the freedom of
women in London (and else-
where) to walk alone at night
without fear of being raped.
The link between porno-
graphy and rape may be tenuous,
but I believe that the domination
(whether explicitly violent or
implicit) and humiliation of
women by men, which is what
most pornography represents,
conditions the attitudes of men
towards women. Pornography, I
believe, is both a symptom and
cause of sexist attitudes, of
which the ultimate manifestation
is rape.
Finally, suppose the Mines
Review was racist, depicting and
exploiting (in however subtle a
fashion) the domination of black
people by whites. In a multi-
r a c i a l society it w o u l d be
disallowed immediately, but
because the M i n e s Review
features women, and exploits the
d o m i n a t i o n of w o m e n , it's
supposed to be o k a y . O u r
society has got a long way to go
towards sexual equality.
Yours faithfully
Robert Kelsey
