U G M
I have received a rather insulting
letter from Nick Pyne over last
week's U G M report; in it he
asserts that the pornography
motion could not possibly have
been defeated by 160 votes, as
reported in F E L I X . He suggests
that 60 is nearer the correct
figure, and continues 'where you
got your facts from I just cannot
imagine'.
I am not certain where we got
the figure from (the reporter
who wrote the story is only
'reasonably sure' it was Nick
Pyne who gave her the informa-
tion) but I do know that I gave
the story to Nick himself to
check before it was printed.
But whoever is to blame for
the inaccuracy, two facts are
very clear. Firstly, until F E L I X
news staff investigated the story,
nearly everyone believed the
motion to have been defeated by
just six votes. And secondly, no
one, even now, seems to know
the correct figure. A l l of which
goes to confirm what I wrote in
last week's editorial: something
has to be done about the
counting of votes at U G M s .

T H O S E O F Y O U who study
Life Sciences will have noticed a
news sheet entitled Helix distri-
buted about your department
last week. The gossip column of
this rag devoted an entire half-
page to F E L I X Editor Martin S
Taylor, describing him as a
'hero', a 'great j o u r n a l i s t ' ,
'amazing', and 'young'.
Unhappily for Helix, the one
solitary fact in the article is false:
they claim Martin is often found
in the bar of the R C M because of
the abundance of women there.
We checked this out, and Martin
told us he had never drunk in the
R C M (although since he saw the
article we haven't been able to
keep him away). But he was able
to give us an interesting story
concerning the publication of
Helix.
It appears that about two
weeks ago a small rodentlike
man asked Martin if it would be
possible to print 'something' at
the Union Print Unit. He didn't
actually name the publication as
Helix at the time, but he did
seem most keen that Martin
shouldn't see it. Of course, as
soon as he was out of the office,
a whole cluster of F E L I X hacks
gathered round the mysterious
paper, scrutinising its pages,
eagerly searching for some titbit

Waste Paper
Well, not exactly waste, just
slightly curled. Still, it's curled
too much for us to print on, so
Central Stores are selling off
their old stock of the paper
F E L I X is printed on for only £3
a ream (500 sheets). If you want,
we can guillotine it down to A 4
for y o u . A n y o n e interested

What's On
Just for a change, Diane has
decided that Tuesday should
follow Wednesday and Thursday
instead of preceding them.
Apologies for this, but rest
assured that the events listed
under 'Tuesday' are Tuesday's
events: it was the page numbers
which got mixed up, not the
headings.

leader. It was lucky they did, or
no one might have noticed that
Helix had been submitted with
all the artwork laid out back to
front and the pages in the wrong
order.
F I V E P R O F E S S O R S were
nominated for the ET lookalike
competition: in the left-hand
column from top to bottom ET,
Prof Lehman D o C , D r Engel
Physics, and in the right-hand
column Prof Sawistowski Chem
Eng, Prof Mason Geophysics
and Prof Brown Civ Eng. I can
accept no responsibility for any
resemblance, real or imaginary,
to E T and even less responsi-
bility for the lies our reporter
had to tell to get the photo-
graphs, none of which particular-
ly reveal the ET-ness of their
subjects. Indeed, the photo of
Professor Sawistowski not only
doesn't look like ET, it doesn't
look much like Professor Sawis-
towski either.
Nor will I stick my neck
out and say which I think looks
most like everybody's favourite
alien, but it is the consensus in
the F E L I X Office that Professor
Brown should be awarded the
Jingles haircut voucher.
