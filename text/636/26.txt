FREMANTLE HOTEL
The Fremantle Hotel is the most recent addition to the Head Tenancy
stock and because it is designed more along the lines of a Residence
than the other Head Tenancies, applications are via the Halls and
Houses procedure rather than the Head Tenancy procedure.
The Hotel is situated in West Cromwell Road, close to the Earls Court
Road and provides accommodation for 133 students in single and shared
rooms. All rooms have a telephone for incoming calls and a built in radio.
Many rooms have their own bathrooms. There is a large communal
kitchen, launderette, common room and licensed bar.
GERRARD MANSIONS
This block contains five flats each comprising two single bedrooms,
kitchen/diner and bathroom. They were originally let unfurnished and
have been furnished by the present tenants with varying degrees of
success!
Situated in the heart of Chinatown, they are, to say the least, exotic. If
you are considering applying for these flats you would be well advised to
discuss the implications with the Student Services Officer.
