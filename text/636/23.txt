STUDENTS HOUSES
The six Houses listed below are all situated within fifteen minutes walk of
the College and together provide furnished accommodation for 442
students in single and shared rooms. Each house has a television and
recreational room (the latter typically including a dart board and table
football). Kitchen facilities are provided together with washing machines,
dryers and ironing facilities. In addition, each House takes a selection of
daily newspapers.
Residents are provided with blankets and pillows.
Cooking utensils, crockery, cutlery and bed linen are not provided.
Residents are expected to clean their own rooms with the materials
provided. Communal areas (lounges, stairs, kitchens and bathrooms)
are cleaned during the week by part-time staff.
Resident postgraduate Wardens and sub-wardens are ultimately
responsible for the organisation and discipline within a House, but are
advised on such matters by a House Committee comprising elected
members. However, most of a House Committee's time is spent
arranging social events and seeking ways to improve a House.
Evelyn Gardens and Queensbury Place are located in a controlled
parking area. Parking permits can be obtained from the Council if you
satisfy the necessary requirements.
