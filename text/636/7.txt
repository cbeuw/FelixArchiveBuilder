Although it is possible to forget it,
in an alcoholic haze or ignorant
daze, the future does not go away.
We all have to cope with it at
some time in our lives, both on a
personal level and on a broader
level, when thinking about the
future of our descendants and
their environment—that is the
future of the w o r l d . Some
'system' that can provide the
answers on both these levels is
obviusly highly desirable. For
this reason it is worthwhile
considering the merits of the
various possibls systems.
On a personal level—if one is
to contemplate one's own future
without getting suicidally de-
pressed, one has to have a
certain amount of self-con-
fidence. This self-confidence
finds its root in self-respect
which in turn finds its root in
belief. There is belief in oneself
and there is belief in God. I
would not say that it is impos-
sible for a person to survive by
believing wholly in his own
abilities—but I suggest that such
an intense, vulnerable belief is
not all that good for the charac-
ter. Anyone who has watched
Chariots of Fire might well agree.
On a worldwide level, there are
many suggestions applicable to
T H E N E E D F O R R E L I G I O N
the future survival and develop-
ment of the human race.
Can science alone save us?
Surely not, when it produces,
along with all the good, a great
deal of bad. (I am thinking of
course, of nuclear weapons).
Science without a moral code is
no answer.
A world government is a good
idea but it has an inherent
disadvantage—what type of
government? Democratic? Re-
publican? Capitalist? Commu-
nist? Dictatorship? There will
enable us to survive but it offers
little hope of improving our lot
in the distant future.
Pressure groups such as
Amnesty International or Green-
peace serve a useful purpose in
that in their own limited fields,
they strive for and sometimes
achieve a better future. But the
problems of the world need to be
tackled with a less sectarian
outlook. There are many prob-
lems; not merely those of, for
example, the abuse of human
rights or animal rights.
'The fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion
is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race,
and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men."
Baha'u'llah
The Prophet Founder of the Baha'i Faith
always be opposing ideas, so
there w i l l always be party
politics. Infighting and strife will
be the order of the day. This is
an old world disease and world
government as we know it is an
old-world solution—it might
Economic systems cannot, by
themselves, solve the world's
problems. In order to have a
wholesome economy, we must
first create the social conditions
which make cooperation on
planetary scale possible—and
healthy social relationships
depend only partially on econo-
mics.
Can education do anything?
Of course, but the world's
•present problems are due to
lack of morals rather than lack
of intellect.
Only religion can solve the
twin problem of the future of the
individual and the future of the
human race as a whole. Only
through a common bond of
religious belief will the human
race survive and prosper in an
a t m o s p h e r e o f p e a c e a n d
harmony. I shall not quajify
these statements—if you want
them qualified, then come to the
Physics C o m m o n R o o m , 8th
floor of the Physics Building at
6:30pm next Wednesday, Feb-
ruary 16. There will be speakers
representing the Hindus, Jews,
Buddhists, Christians, Moslems
and Baha'is. They will speak on
'The Need for Religion', giving
their personal views. The audi-
ence will be given a chance to
ask questions of the panel.
Professor Raphael, Head of the
Department of Humanities, will
chair the meeting in an atmos-
phere of harmony and together-
ness.
