IC vs Charing Cross 25-11
While spending five minutes
recovering from Daddy's warm-
up session we gave C C H a
c h a r i t a b l e start with some
unopposed practice and they
crashed over for the first score.
So we started again, and this
t^me meant it, with our forwards
proving more and more domi-
nant as the match progressed,
providing our threes with good
ball and they in turn showed that
it was just as easy to make good
qse of it as it was to waste it.
As usual, stupid penalties let
C.CH off the hook more than
once, but equally stupid C C H
didn't know that Steve Phillips
could slot kicks over from
anywhere so he got three and a
conversion or two. A pity he
couldn't repeat that with the ol'
drop kicks.
j Andy—try a match—Ralph
yet again proved how tight he
vgas by cocking up what would
have been his third push-over try
so that he didn't have to buy a
jug.
Pete Hardee now knows what
'Conservation of Momentum'
means (and wishes he didn't)
after a little bump from Miles
who could get a lesson in calling
for the ball from Pete—'why
aren't I 3ft taller?"—Richards
who proved a better caller than
judge of a ball's trajectory. Oh,
and I got a try somewhere—
thanks guys—my first for the
team (and last?). What sack,
Warick?
Summing up, we should have
had more points, and them
less—deja vu?

IC vs St Mary's 69-114
The scoreline is a true repre-
sentation of this match, a walk-
over. We held out for about a
quarter of the match and then
the landslide started.
The match emphasised our
nfajor problem, that of team
organisation. But a set of players
can't be organised to work as a
team when the players never
turn up on a regular basis.
On the individual level, 28
points from Ken Jarrett (will
nothing stop* him?) and 24 points
from Frank Rawlins were both
tremendous efforts but were
nullified by the number of times
the team (including them) gave
the ball away.
Overall a disappointing match
which showed a lot of room for
improvements.
Team: Andy Chapman, Tim
Vink, Tammam Hamza, Ken
Jarrett, George Drowngas, Frank
Rawlins and Thalis Kavagawnis.

IC vs Goldsmiths 4-0
It is with regret that IC Football
Club 1st X I announce the sad
passing of Goldsmiths from the
U L U Challenge Cup semi-final
on Saturday, February 5, 1983.
This untimely end was brought
about by four fatal blows,
without reply, administered by
Griffiths, McGuckin, Stephen-
son and R i c k a r d , and was
necessary after a recurrence of
rabid behaviour from the un-
fortunate beast.
A wake was held immediately
afterwards but a more formal
requiem will take place on
March 5 at Motspur Park.
No flowers by request, dona-
tions to brewery of own choice.

IC vs LSK 9-0
Here's another b a d m i n t o n
report so that Chess Club won't
get a look in! Actually, this
week's report is a s t i r r i n g
account of daring do-or-die
badminton playing.
LSE didn't stand a chance.
T o n y had d r o p p e d h i m s e l f
giving Imperial the chance to
play at their best and when they
play their best they could beat
Hackney ninth team.
Anyway to the match. Ian and
Dominic played with continental
flair—Ian with his blood alcohol
level below the legal limit for the
first time in two years. Honest
John proved that you don't have
to be above six feet tall to win
and Steve and Pete played well
once Pete had woken up.
The outcome was that IC won
easily and are now heading
towards the heights of division
one champions.

IC3 vs Guys 2-7
Dear Sir
Even though I am a medic, I
must admit that you scientist
chappies are damned good at
badders what? Tally ho eh! It
was only your third team as well
and we didn't stand a chance. By
jove, I thought your strokes were
very good indeed, I certainly
enjoyed them. As for your
backhahds
Yours in brooding admiration

PS: That should have been the
report, but we only took four
players the court was awful and
we lost several games inex-
plicably, didn't we Chris?
Badminton Bar Night: I can't
remember anything about this,
so it's a good job my spy was
there with a camera. Money to
John via Chem M a i l Racks
please, or next week's F E L I X
w i l l have some interesting

Star of the team on Wednesday
February 2 on the St Edmund
Hall Relay at Oxford was Jon
Lea who ran a dynamic second
leg for the A team on a course
marginally over three miles long
in 16 minutes 45 seconds. Jon
kept much of his speed when
running the last leg of the B team
in 17mins 17s. Graham Harker
had another disappointing race
basically because of a tactical
cock-up and ran the first A
team.
Phil Parr-Burman produced a
sturdy 18 mins 45s for the B
team and was helpfully backed
