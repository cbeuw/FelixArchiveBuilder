The Penrose tessellation, the subject ofDrPretzel's talk to MOPSOC
on Tuesday, is one of the most astonishing mathematical
curiosities ever discovered. First drawn by Roger Penrose (who
also invented the famous optical illusion of the ever-descending
staircase) the pattern has an enormous number of amazing and
beautiful properties, nearly all of which can be demonstrated using
O-level maths. Well worth joining MOPSPOC just for this lecture.
