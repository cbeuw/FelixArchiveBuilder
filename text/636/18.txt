-As the new What's On co-ordinator, I feel it is now time to re-
iterate a few of the points that were made at the beginning of the
session. Firstly, I am not responsible for my own actions con-
cerning times, non-existent dates and deciphering of hieroglyphic
entries. Secondly, I am even less responsible for items which are
not'written on What's On forms. Please put your entry on the
correct form-you have a choice between 'Single Entry'and 'Item to
be repeated weekly'. If you must insist on not using a form, write in
fluorescent ink and attach a five pound note firmly to the top left-
hand corner of whatever you choose to write on instead. Finally, I
may be tempted to award a dishonourable mention to the worst
entry to What's On each week.
