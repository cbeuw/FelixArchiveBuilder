A quick report: Moral victory by
IC at Cambridge. In fact in wind
strength 4 gusting 5 their boats
wouldn't take it and fell to bits
almost to order. When the
number of complete boats was
reduced from six to three racing
was abandoned. Superb sailing
but very cold!
The week before saw contrast-
ing conditions and I C beat
Sussex (away) in two races in
very light conditions. It is
pleasurable to note that U L 2
(which now includes no less than
four IC defectors) lost in two
races and managed to capsize a
boat. If you start getting reports
about IC2. You'll know who we
mean!
IC team: Graham, Graham,
Jim, Richard, Phil, Dave.
Special note: replies concern-
ing sailing in Holland to G
Kennedy BE3 pronto please.

Did you know that Quasimodo
was originally a detective with
the Met, but he was slung out
because he keep saying "I have a
hunch '? Or that the most
popular flavoured chewing-gum
in Greenland is anchovy? If you
did then you're either demented
or lying because I just made up
both stories, but if you're bigger
than me I'll let it pass.
Meanwhile, having doled out
this week's ration of idiocy, to
business. ICVBC played South
Bank Poly on Wednesday Feb-
ruary 2, losing, as is our wont,
the first set but finally over-
coming our own crappy playing
and opposition bolstered by a
junior national player to win 9-
15, 15-13, 15-2, 15-10. Not one
of our better moments.
Also, last Tuesday the trials
for the London University team
were held and out of the seven
bods who turned up, five were
from I C V B C so unless there is a
drastic change in recruitment
p o l i c y , we s h o u l d be well
represented for the first time
ever, in the British Universities
tournament to be held in Belfast
in April.
Two little bits to round off,
both of which were held over
from last week's gem for lack of
space.
Firstly, the reason for the
club meeting in the back of the
van was to decide a colour
scheme for the new clubkitâ€”
maroon shirts, sky-blue shorts
and fluorescent green socks
being the majority verdict in vile
taste. If that's too much for you,
try Eno's Fruit Salt.
S e c o n d l y , i f any P o l i s h -
speaking Motorhead fans could
kidnap Andy Knapp, Physics 1,
no questions asked, the fee could
be worked out later. (Kidnapp??)
Don't forget, next Wednesday
(February 16) we are at home to
Goldsmiths, see you then.

The past week has been full of
interesting events for Imperials
top sports club. Despite a poor
attendance at the range on
Wednesday some reasonable
scores were registered, all of
which escape me at the moment.
Tim Higgs again failed to show
the kind of form that he thinks
he is capable of, with poor scores
in both external leagues and in
the U L match against Cam-
bridge University on Saturday.
Five IC students were shooting
for U L in this match, together
accounting for nearly 50% of the
team. Despite poor shooting
from Cambridge marksmen on
their home range, we were still
beaten by 19 points, our team
upset by the short details and
unusual range. Gordon Bowser
improved drastically on his
second card with Gary Smith,
Mark Barke and Tim Higgs and
shooting consistently badly.
Noel Lindsay shot well and
pulled the U L team from the
jaws of ignominy, probably
because of his alcohol content.
For all you freshers who were
put off by the large crowds in the
range last term, we are looking
for new targets, so please show
your faces. Anybody who looks
like T i m Higgs particularly
welcome. Will members please
sign up for club dinner, Bisley
trips, etc, on the notices in the
range.

All opposition were annihilated
this week following last week's
disaster. Great! Apologies to
thirds and fiths re M x H 2nds
and 3rds late cancellations.
Next week there are a couple
of extra fixtures, ie vs ICX, and
squash's own 'Bottle Match' vs
Camborne so 'get ticking' if you
haven't already. There is also the
Scottish Universities' Engineer-
ing Field Day to which IC could
send a two-player team.
Correction to last week's
F E L I X : Greg Pollard! Nice logo
though (?).
No jumpers yet sorry. Queen's
College, Cambridge, want a
weekend fixture. This year's
British Open is in Derby about
April 12-16 (see below). Sweat-
shirt designs are 'pouring' in.
Can anyone find me a pixture of
the IC crest (including Latin) say
3-4 inches tall?
Germany: A p r i l 6-13 inc,
Army barracks accommodation
(?), size of party 110, travel by
minibus. Max possible travel sub
50%. T o u r is open to any
member. See noticeboard for
details. So until next Friday
Imperial College Boat C l u b
entered their first race of 1983 at
Peterborough on Saturday, and
in difficult conditions won six
events.
The first race was a time trial
over the short 2500m course and
was won by the elite coxed four
with the coxless four coming
second and both crews winning
their respective sections. The
seniro B coxed four, novice
sculler and ladies sculler also
won their sections by convincing
margins. The ladies coxed four
came a disappointing 4th in their
category.
In the second race, a time trial
over the longer 5500m course for
eights, the College 1st V I I I
comprising of the top two fours,
t r i u m p h e d e m p h a t i c a l l y i n
winning by over a minute.
In this they defeated the best
of the Cambridge colleges as
well as top class club crews.
The novice and senior B eight
each came second in their
respective sections which all
bodes well for the c o m i n g
regatta season.

Three were tragically defeated
by University College Hospital.
By two goals to nil. They leave a

damp spectator. It must be said
that they laboured in vain for
goals and at the going down of

FELIXI I February 11, 19831
Well I'm back again enforcing
the point that IC Judo Club are
brill. But before that I want to
make sure you noticed the
'thingy' by the heading. How-
ever, meanwhile, back at Crystal
Palace last weekend IC was well
represented in the BUSF tourna-
ment. This is probably the
largest competition of the year,
with representatives from many
univeriities, polytechnics and
colleges. On Saturday Terry got
two bronze medals from 'his
group and on Sunday, Anna got
a silver medal for the women's
under 56 kilos event. I fought in
the womens under 66 kilos and
although I didn't win anything I
was pleased to get through to the
quarter finals. The men's team
event, also took place on Sunday
and in this kieth and Terry won
silver medals.
Finally, after such superb
examples don't forget the U L U
inter-colleaiate competition on
Friday March 4.
