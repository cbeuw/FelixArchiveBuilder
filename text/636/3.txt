Small Explosion in Montpelier
Street—Not Many Dead
There was an explosion at 1:00pm
on Tuesday at Montepelier Hall,
and all power was cut off until
6:30pm.
The cause of the explosion was
an overloaded transformer,
located under the pavement
outside the Hall.
One of the cleaners, who was
in the basement at the time, said
that the blast sounded like
one of the Hyde Park bombs and
flames and smoke were seen.
A fire engine was called to
bring the conflagration under
control, and the London Elec-
tricity Board had the offending
transformer repaired by 6:30pm.
Miss Gittins, the housekeeper,
said they were still working on it
on Wednesday.
Don Monro, the Warden, had
much pleasure in announcing
that the brown and grey rats of
M o n t p e l i e r H a l l were not
affected by the blast, nor were
the students.

Embassy
Protest
A force of fifty policemen turned
up at a protest outside the Iraqi
Embassy in Queensgate on
Wednesday — not to control
protesters, but to protect them.
Some thirty Iraqi students,
mostly from Imperial, held a
silent demonstration to mark the
anniversary of the coup which
established the present totali-
tarian regime in their homeland.
Many wore scarves over their
faces to avoid recognition—
opposition to the State, they told
F E L I X , is a capital offence in
Iraq—and in fact two photo-
graphers from the Embassy were
seen taking photographs of the
dissidents.
Representatives from the
National Union of Students also
arrived and attempted to deliver
FELIX H H H M M M S a M m
a petition with over a thousand
signatures from representatives
of almost every student union in
B r i t a i n . They were refused
access to the embassy, where
staff would not accept the
petition. A n N U S spokesman
said that this was the only
embassy in London where a
petition would not even be
accepted. As an example of what
the petition was about, he said
that a student who changed his
course at university abroad
without permission from the
Embassy would be liable to a
five-year term in prison on
returning to Iraq.
The police officer in charge of
the operation seemed surprised
when asked whether the police
presence was to keep the pro-
testers calm. He explained that
on previous occasions, demon-
strators had been attacked from
inside the embassy and there was
a possibility of similar trouble
on this occasion. The protest
ended peacefully 2:00pm.
Aid for Overseas Students
Forty-six million pounds will be
put aside by the Government to
provide scholarships and awards
for overseas students, it was
announced on Tuesday. Steps are
also being taken that may result
in students from British depen-
dancies such as Hong Kong being
given home student status.
On Tuesday, the Foreign
Secretary M r F r a n c i s P y m
informed the House of Commons
that some five thousand new
awards would be made each year
to foreign students whose British
education would be 'an advan-
tage to this country'. (This has
been taken to mean political
advantage in foreign relations.)
This step is in response to the
Overseas Students Trust report
published last June, which called
for a review o f government
policy, and it was probably
prepared before the House of
L o r d s ' ruling in December
which made thousands of for-
eign students eligible for Local
Authority awards. The report
also called for a scheme allowing
students from British depen-
dancies to pay home student
fees, thereby cutting their high
rates by up to eight percent. The
report considered it ridiculous
that the students could be paying
up to three times as much as
students from Europe. Depend-
ing on the outcome of the
impending talks with the Hong
K o n g government, students
from Bermuda, the Falklands
and several other territories
could be affected.
M i n k
S t o l e
£10,000 worth of mink pelts were
stolen from outside the Exhibi-
tion Road gates on Friday at
about 1:10pm.
The van, which contained
several cartons for delivery at a
number of destinations, was
parked on E x h i b i t i o n R o a d
pointing towards South Ken-
sington Station, while the driver
went into the College to find out
where to make his delivery.
During the ten minutes he was
away from his van two men, who
Police believe had been follow-
ing in a beige Cortina or Granada
estate, removed the minks. The
padlock on the back of the blue
Luton van had been opened and
then replaced, to conceal the
break-in.
M r Donaldson, the Security
Officer normally at the Gate-
house, had been called away,
and returned 1:15-1:20 to find
the robbery had already oc-
curred.
The minks were in a carton
wrapped in brown hessian, 5' by
2' and weighting 75 kilos. It had
OFT 0230 Italy stamped on. The
van had the name 'S G Smith' in
a white circle printed on the side.
If anyone has any information
about these pelts, which belong
to Overseas Fur Trading, and
were due to be made up in Italy,
they should contact: Detective
Constable G a r y M u d d e n of
Gerald Road Police Station.
Phone 434-6244.

Spending
Survey
Average student spending last
year was over two thousand
pounds, according to the recent
ICU Cost of Living survey. This
compares with last year's maxi-
mum grant of £1,825.
The External Affairs Commit-
tee sent questionnaires to two
hundred r a n d o m l y selected
students, only eighty of whom
replied. From this small sample,
the average weekly rent was
calculated at £22.64, while the
amount spent per week on
entertainment varies from
nothing to fifty pounds. Clothes
and books accounted for a
hundred and fifty pounds per
year. Total annual expenditure
averaged £2,071.83.
The committee has admitted
that these results are of limited
use because of the very small
sample size. A n o t h e r , more
detailed, survey is being planned.
Clash Cgrds
The servicetill in the Sherfield
Building has been the cause of
several complaints since the
issue of the new car park cards.
The magnetic tickets used by
motorists to operate the barriers
affect the strips on the bank's
card dispenser cards.
The l o c a l b r a n c h of the
NatWest bank has issued a
notice advising cardholder-s to
keep their servicecards sep-
arately from their car park
ticket.
