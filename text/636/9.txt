ThirdWorld First
Anti-Poverty Action Week
Imperial College Third World First Society is
organising an APA campaign, which involves
canvassing halls of residence, so if you want to
know more before a canvasser knocks on your
door—read on.
IC3W1 is less than two terms old, so many of
you may not know much about 3W1, or even
of its existence.
3W1 is an independent student organisation,
founded in 1969. It is recognised by NUS and
supported financially by Oxfam, Christian Aid
the EEC, as well as several charitable trusts.
APA is 3Wl's longest and most successful
campaign, and like the other campaigns, it is
designed to highlight the underlying causes of
world poverty and to illustrate the economic
links between the industrial countries and the
Third World.
APA is a student based self-tax campaign,
supporters of which commit 1% of their grant
by banker's order. That comes to about 5p a
day for every day of the year.
Half the money goes as direct aid, and the
other half is committed to education and
campaigning in Britain.
Supporters can choose one of the five main
areas for which their money is used as direct
aid:
A. Development Projects in the Third
World: local projects through Oxfam and War
on Want.
B. Church Support for Development:
CHANGE
YOUR
WORLD!
Christian Aid and the Catholic Fund for
Overseas Development (CAFOD).
C. International Action: small single issue
groups which lack national publicity, such as
the Eritrean Relief Association, th» Inter-
mediate Technology Development Group, and
the Nicaragua Reconstruction Fund.
D. Development Education: educational
and campaigning work of 3W1.
E. Racial and Social Justice in Britain:
through, for example, Shelter, Child Poverty
Action Group, and the Joint Council for the
Welfare of Immigrants.
Provision is made on the banker's order for
the supporter's own choice if he or she so
wishes.
The other half of the money goes to 3W1
campaigns in Britain, on higher education and
development, women, health, disarmament,
and north-south issues.
Each supporter of A P A receives four
mailings a year which form a comprehensive
introduction to issues facing development
campaigners today.
The mailings include a regular campaigns
bulletin of news, views and events, 3Wl's twice
yearly development magazine, 'Links' or four
factsheets, and news of conferences, day
events and study-tours.
APA Week at IC is organised for February
14-18, during which it is hoped to cover many
of the Halls of Residence.
However, if your Hall is not covered or you
live outside Colelge Halls, then there will be an
APA Bookstall and display in the JCR every
lunchtime during the week, so you are
welcome to come along and join APA there.
For any enthusiasts who would like to
campaign, there will be a breifing on the first
day, Monday February 14 at 5:30pm in the
Green Committee Room.
For more information, go to to the display or
contact John Sattaur, Chairman IC3W1.
