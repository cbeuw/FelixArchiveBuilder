FREMANTLE
Five prominent members and ex-members of ICU are accused of
causing £350 of damage during the Fremantle Hotel party on Saturday.
Pat Leggett, Laurie Tomlinson, Gary Pike, Jon Symes, and Dave
Dunstan will face disciplinary hearings in the next four weeks.
Trouble started as the band
Horizon, were finishing their
gig. A group of non-residents
tried to push residents away
from the bar. As the trouble
escalated, Gary Turner, the
Fremantle sub-warden, closed •
the bar. This only resulted in
beer glasses being thrown about.
In addition several promotional
items lying on the bar were
smashed.
However, most of the damage
was done when the vandals
turned their attention to the
pinball machine. Several people
started butting parts of the
machine with their heads, and
the back glass was smashed. M r
Turner later commented that 'It
was a bad end to a good night,
they even had the bloody gall to
do it front of me.'
The normal procedure in this
sort of case is that the hall
committee sends the people to a
disciplinary sub-committee
consisting of Stephen Goulder
the Union President, and Dr
Robin Smith, the College Tutor.
These two may then impose a
fine of up to £50. If they feel this
punishment is insufficient, they
may then call a meeting of the
main disciplinary committee,
although this is rare.
Although the hall committee
will not meet until Monday,
reports of what took place have
already been sent to the depart-
mental tutors and the College
tutor. Dr Smith was unavailable
for comment but Student Ser-
vices Officer Michael Arthur
said that no firm decision had
been taken. However, he said
that it was important that the
culprits should be made to pay
for the damage.

J'Accuse!
One of the most d r a m a t i c
accusations ever directed against
a British Prime Minister was
made by Tarn Dalyell (Labour
M P for West Lothian) speaking
to a crowded meeting of Imperial
College Labour Club yesterday.
He charged Margaret Thatcher
with deliberately and cold-
bloodedly provoking an un-
necessary war with Argentina,
which led to the death of over
200 British soldiers, in order to
bolster her own personal position
with a successful foreign adven-
ture.
The Prime Minister, he said,
ordered the sinking of the ageing
Argentine cruiser, the General
Belgrano, in order to sabotage
the peace plans which were then
on the point of success.
She d i d t h i s i n the f u l l
knowledge that the Argentine
fleet was returning to port prior
to a general withdrawal of
troops from the Falklands. This
information had been passed to
her by American intelligence,
who had penetrated the Argen-
tine High Command.
Furthermore, he alleged that
she took the decision to provoke
the war without consulting the
Foreign Secretary Francis Pym,
who was c o n d u c t i n g peace
negotiations. At the time there
was no threat to British forces.
Tarn Dalyell also revealed that
some days before the sinking he
had privately warned the Prime
Minister of the horrific conse-
quences of war with Argentina.
"I left the meeting chilled," he
said, "she wanted to fight." But,
it wasn't Mrs Thatcher that
suffered in the confict that
followed: " N o bombs fell on
G r a n t h a m , " he pointed out,
"it's easy to be brave with other
people's lives." He also claimed
that purely political reasons
were behind Thatcher's orders to
invade South Georgia in appall-
ing weather conditions and
against naval advice.
The Prime Minister and her
Cabinet deliberately misled the
House of Commons, he said, by
lying about the details of the
attack on the Belgrano. The little
lies hid the biggest lie of all; that
the war was necessary at all. .
D a l y e l l has painstakingly
established, through over 300
Parliamentary questions, that
the Government has gone to
extraordinary lengths to obscure
the truth.
He went on to say that the
computer on H M S Sheffield was
p r o g r a m m e d to ignore tae
Western made Exocet missiles
w h i c h were assumed to be
'friendly weapons' because the
Russians do not have them. The
Sheffield was destroyed by an
Exocet in retaliation for the
sinking of the Belgrano. He also
suggested that the merchant
ship, the Atlantic Conveyor may
have been deliberately used as a
decoy for Exocets, in order to
protect warships. Merchant
seamen were treated shabbily
too: Chinese gallery staff were
taken to the Falklands agairist
their will.
Dalyell, who for speaking out
against the war on April 3 1982
was sacked by Michael Fdot
from Labour's Front Bench,
said that most Labour M P s
didn't understand the nature of
the conflict: 'Galtieri wasn't
Benito Mussolini,' he said, 'but
he was very nearly Margaret
Thatcher.'
Both, like Bonaparte, needed
foreign wars to stifle cricitism at
home.
These startling allegations
have so far gone largely un-
reported in the British press.'but
Tarn Dalyell anticipates that
with the publication of Alex-
a n d e r H a i g ' s f o r t h c o m i n g
memoirs, the full truth of Mrs
Thatcher's personal responsi-
bility for the Falklands War will
be revealed.
