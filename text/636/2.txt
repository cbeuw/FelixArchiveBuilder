A l t h o u g h students are not
automatically eligible for free
prescriptions, dental treatment
and glasses, most students can
get them free on the grounds of
low income. In calculating your
income for these purposes the
D H S S takes the total grant
figure and divides it by 38 to get
a weekly rate (30 weeks term-
time and 8 weeks vacations). For
1982/3 this works out at £50.00
per week. If, after deducting the
amount you pay for rent and
rates, your total weekly income
is between £19 and £28 and
providing you don't have savings
of over £2,000 you should be
eligible for free treatment. If
your income is only slightly
more than £28 per week you may
still be eligible for treatment at a
reduced rate.

Summer Vacation
There is no element in the
student grant to cover the
summer vacation and con-
sequently if you don't find
summer employment you will be
eligible to 'sign on' for Supple-
mentary Benefit. People on
Supplementary Benefit have
what is known as an 'automatic
right' to free prescriptions,
dental treatment and glasses so it
may be worth savin0 any non-
urgent treatment until the
summer if you do not qualify at
other times.
If you have an 'automatic
right' simply tell your dentist or
optician and ask them to arrange
the forms for you. For prescrip-
tion charges, get a receipt when
the c.c.unions

you pay the charge and take it to
your local DHSS Office who
will give you a refund.
Prescriptions
Prescriptions now cost £1.30 per
item and another increase is due
soon, so it's worth investigating
your entitlements. Don't wait
until you need a prescription, get
form P l l now and apply for an
exemption certificate. If you are
successful in getting a prescrip-
tion exemption certificate on the
grounds of low income, this will
give you the 'automatic right' to
free dental treatment and
glasses. If your claim is refused
and you think you may need a
large number of items on
prescription in the next few
months then it may be worth
considering a pre-payment
certificate. These cost £7 for 4
months and £20 for a year and
they cover the cost of any
number of prescriptions needed
in that period. To apply get form
FP95 from your local chemist,
Post Office or DHSS.
DHSS Treatment
Dental charges can only be
claimed back for treatment
available under the National
Health Service. No help is
available for private treatment.
The Student Services Office and
Student Health Centre have
lists of dentists willing to provide
NHS treatment to students but it
is always advisable^to check with
the dentist that the work he
intends to do can be covered or
you could end up facing a
substantial bill.
Some dentists will arrange the
reimbursement of costs for you,
most will expect you to pay the
charge yourself and claim them
back. Ask the dentist for form
FID, fill it in and send it to your
nearest DHSS office who should
reimburse you if you are eligible.
•
Free N H S Glasses
As with dental charges free
optical treatment can only be
claimed for work available
under the NHS. This includes
NHS glasses (frames and lenses)
but not contact lenses. There are
six types of frames available
under the NHS, ask your opti-
cian to show them to you. Sight-
tests are free to anyone but you
must tell the optician that you
want a NHS not a private test.
Again check with the optician
before y o u start that any
intended work can be covered
under the N a t i o n a l H e a l t h
Service. As with dental charges
you will have to pay first and
claim back later. A s k the
optician for form F l , fill it in
and send it to your local DHSS.
Students with Families
If you're supporting a family on
a student grant it's essential that
you know your free entitlements.
The table above may help.
More Information?
Leaflets P l l for prescriptions,
D l l for dental treatment, G i l
for glasses, a MV11 for milk and
vitamins are available from the
Student Services Office, Student
Health Centre, your local DHSS
and most central Post Offices.
These leaflets explain more fully
what you can claim and in the
case of the P l l and M V 1 1
contain necessary forms for you
to complete and send off.
Remember it is easier to apply
for a prescription exemption
certificate now than it is to try
and claim back prescription
charges once you've paid them.
A l s o , as mentioned above,
holding a prescription exemp-
tion certificate gives you the
'automatic right' to free dental
treatment and glasses.
If you have any queries or
problems with your claim, call
into the Student Services Office,
15 Princes Gardens, any week-
day between 9:30am and 6:00pm.
These benefits are yours by
right - make sure you claim them.
