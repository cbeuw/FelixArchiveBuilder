W
ith the start
of a new
year loom-
ing omi-
nously on
the horizon, 15 rock climbers got to-
gether to tackle the mountains and
brave the elements of... Mallorca.
So, not really an extreme outdoor ad-
venture then, but definitely the sort
of kick-off that every academic year
should have with sun, sea and rock to
keep us entertained. As we stepped off
the plane on foreign soil, new presi-
dent Alex warned us that we would
have 3 “Golf-size” cars of an unknown
make and model between the lot of us,
which sent shivers down the spines of
the more experienced members of the
club. Since everyone was expecting
to be packed like sardines into tiny
cars, everyone let out a collective
sigh of relief when were shown to
our shiny new-model Meganes.
The relief turned into joy when we
finally stumbled upon our villa in Vall-
demossa, a beautiful 7-room behemoth
of a house, complete with swimming
pool, 3 patios and a grill. After a frantic
game of 15-player bed shotgun, every-
one settled down for the first night of
the holiday.
In the morning, we were greeted by a
stunning view of the Valldemossa val-
ley, and over a relaxed lunch picked
our first climbing destination of the
trip - a light warm-up at the nearby
crag of S’estret. As the sun rose and
temperatures soared, the initial wave
of energetic climbing died off, but
not before Virgil and Hal ticked
off a 6c on a brilliant limestone
overhang.
Eventually, we found our-
selves back at the villa making
dinner at a very traditionally
Spanish time, with the bar-
becue fired up only around
9 in the evening - a time we
would stick to throughout
the week and a half. Thanks
to the excellent efforts of
medic Ollie at the hobs, the
food throughout the holiday
was uncharacteristically good for an
ICMC trip.
The days that followed saw some
excellent climbing being done at Sa
Gubia and other crags around Vall-
demossa. Sa Gubia saw some first-time
multi-pitching for some members, but
will perhaps be remembered most for
an absolutely terrifying fall by Alex
off an excellent 6a+. A foot popping
while clipping a distant bolt from an
awkward position lead to a 20-foot fall,
which ended up about 10 feet from the
ground - and he was still back on the
route right afterwards. Most amusing,
however, was an epic descent from a
4-pitch climb by Virgil, Hal and Joe,
who (in an effort to reduce the descent
time from a predicted 90 minutes) ab-
seiled off an overhanging face onto a
rusty anchor and then proceeded to get
lost for the next four hours, arriving at
the car-park well after dark.
By the time we had our first rest day,
everyone had been on a lead rope and
confidence was rising. The rest day saw
most of the club get a taste for some
deep-water soloing on some of the ex-
cellent crozzly (it’s hard to describe,
but you’d know it if you saw it) rock
in the bay. With such an excellent se-
lection of crags around, the days that
followed saw some splitting up of the
group, with some climbers preferring
the multi-pitch routes of Sa Gubia to
the 0-second walk-in of the Roadside
Crag. Both ended up being firm fa-
vourites of the trip - with special men-
tion going to the 6c+ roof at the road-
side crag that went up in an alcove and
then straight over the road, mere feet
above the passing cars.
Another excellent destination was
Cala Magraner, which, despite its dis-
tant location, combined perfectly the
things we came for - sand, sea, sun and
rock. It was on this day that Virgil at-
tacked his first 7a of the trip, a short,
technical route on tiny holds, which
yielded a clean lead at the very end of
the day.
With over a week gone already, most
of the team felt it was time to try some
proper deep-water soloing, so we
headed out to Port de Soller - an
hour away on small, winding roads.
On arrival, we discovered that the
crag was quite a way away, with a
good 200 metre swim in choppy
seas. While some doubted their
swimming ability and stayed be-
hind, 7 intrepid climbers swam out.
Towards the tail-end of the cross-
ing, with the cliff looming mere me-
tres away, Katie screamed bloody
murder and all eyes swept the seas
for dorsal fins.
In the rescue attempt that fol-
lowed, all 7 people in the sea man-
aged to get stung by the school of
jellyfish that had floated into the
bay. After quite a bit of difficulty
getting back to civilisation, Katie’s
painful sting was neutralized by a
lifeguard and we abandoned our ef-
forts at soloing for the day. Five of
us did make a trip out to do some
deep water solo a few days later, this
time without hordes of tentacled
beasts to stop us.
As the trip neared its end, Katie
had to say goodbye a few days early
to start uni (it’s a hard knock life for
medics), leaving the rest of us to
enjoy one day each of climbing and
rest. On the rest day, one car of peo-
ple went out to Magalluf (a place
that can only be described as Chav
Vegas) and had a jolly good time at
BCM, the biggest club in Mallorca.
Well, jolly good until Seb lost his
passport in a drunken haze, leading
to an international, multi-day slog
to get back to England. But, with the
trip having been such a success oth-
erwise, it was hard to feel demoral-
ised by one person’s plight, and all
looked back on a fun-filled yet re-
laxed two weeks of climbing bliss,
completely unlike England. No, in
Mallorca there were no decades-old
Union minibuses, no gentle pat-
tering of freezing rain and not half
as much gloomy darkness as back
home in England.
