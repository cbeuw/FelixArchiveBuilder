Injuries and their treatment
Hannah Barr

We all suffer from sports-related in-
juries from time to time. Here’s an in-
troduction to some common types of
injuries and how best to treat them.
An acute injury is damage to the
soft tissues i.e. muscle, tendon or liga-
ment. Immediately after the injury
the tissues will be bleeding and sub-
sequent inflammation will be taking
place in the local area causing pain and
dysfunction.
A strain is an injury to either a mus-
cle or a tendon. Depending on the
severity of the injury, a strain may be
a simple overstretch of the muscle or
tendon, or it can result from a partial
or complete tear.
A sprain is an injury to a ligament
supporting a joint and can result from
a fall, a sudden twist, or a blow to the
body that forces a joint out of its nor-
mal position and stretches or tears the
ligament supporting that joint.
Often you may exhibit symptoms
that suggest an injury (strain/sprain);
however this can be as a result of tight-
ened muscles pulling other structures
out of alignment, causing referred pain.
In this case these symptoms can often
be effectively released by following a
stretch plan or massage treatment.
Wherever possible aim to PROTECT
vulnerable body parts when participat-
ing in a sport, but when this does not
happen or does not prevent injury the
following information is crucial.
During the first 48 hours following
an injury a magical process known as
‘RICE’ should be applied. Its effective-
ness in reducing pain and inflamma-
tion should not be underestimated,
hence its ‘magical’ tag line!
R = Rest
To prevent further immediate
damage to the affected tissues
and allow the healing process to
begin.
I = Ice (cold)
To reduce pain and local muscle
spasm by numbing the pain re-
ceptors. Stops internal bleeding
by slowing down blood circula-
tion, which in-turn reduces the
amount of bleeding and inflam-
mation in the tissues. Ice time:
dependant on size of structure
injured. Skin should look pale
and not reddened when ice is
removed.
C = Compression
Compress for support and to
control inflammation, which
further helps with pain relief.
E = Elevation
To help decrease bleeding and
inflammation.
During this period you may well re-
quire additional pain relief such as an-
ti-inflammatory gels or non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID’s).
Please consult your pharmacist for ap-
propriate treatment.
After approx. 48 hours:
Rehabilitation
Oncethepainandinflammationhave
gone, exercises to regain lost strength
and mobility can begin. If these symp-
toms re-occur during this process stop
exercises and return to RICE until it is
again safe to return to the rehabilita-
tion phase.
As a sports-person is not always like-
ly to follow the rest component of this
process due to training requirements,
competition and sometimes just plain
foolhardiness (you know who you are),
the injured person should at least exer-
cise with caution and try to follow the
I-C-E part of this procedure, followed
by rehabilitation.
• Heat is not appropriate for first
aid of an injury. It increases bleeding
within the tissue exacerbating inflam-
mation. Only apply heat in recovery
phases.
Active Rehabilitation
Sports-individuals willing to stop
training and competition altogether
are few and far between. Obviously
this is dependant on the severity of the
injury i.e. a ruptured ligament/tendon/
muscle would be impossible not to rest
as the pain would prevent any unrea-
sonable, but desired premature return
to sport.
However many injuries, although
painful and debilitating in terms of
performance, will not necessarily pre-
vent participation. If this is the sports-
person’s choice (it may not be recom-
mended by a sports therapist) then it
is important to give yourself a fighting
chance. With this in mind, injury arti-
cles to follow will provide suggestions
on exercises to help during the recov-
ery process, but they should not be at-
tempted until pain and inflammation
has gone, which would be at least 48
hours afterward.
It is important to note that these are
only guidelines based on a minor acute
episode, and in no way replace the
role of a qualified physician/therapist.
If your condition does not improve
over the 48-hour period, it is strongly
advised that you consult a qualified
therapist. Your injury may be worse
than a strain or sprain, and these type
of injuries, if not given correct treat-
ment immediately after the event, can
become a chronic problem and this is
something you should strive to avoid.
Week 6 and a lot more results are in.
The ranking of the teams is based on
the Felix Index (FI), which is calculated
as follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) – (L*4).
Only teams with 5 games or more will
be considered in the overall champion-
ship at the end of year.
With this week’s results in, Net-
ball 1st, Squash Men’s 1st (this week’s
Team of the Week) and Tennis Men’s
2nd are top of the table with 20 points
each, followed closely by Hockey Men’s
1st and Rugby Men’s 1st.
At the bottom of the table we find
Football Men’s 2nd still rooted to the
bottom, having not won a game yet.

The winner of Enoch’s sublime cross-
word last week is Benjamin Martin.
Congratulations that man. Unfortu-
nately, as he pointed out, he forgot to
attach his solution to his first email
which makes him a loser. If he hadn’t
pointed that out to us, then he would
have won £800,000. That chance has
now gone forever. Really, this would
have happened. No joke. Ah well, life
goes on. Well done Ben, chin up.
Tomo, on behalf of Enoch
