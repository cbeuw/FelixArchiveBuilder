When it comes to rowing, most people
seem to believe that partaking in such
a sport involves waking well before the
rising of the sun, training several times
a day and relinquishing any form of a
social life. However, this is simply un-
true. Mostly.
Imperial College Boat Club has spent
the past month slowly lulling its new
members into a false sense of security
by organising vaguely ‘rowing-themed’
parties and supplying a multitude of
alcoholic beverages. The season kicked
off in the first week with a fresher’s
taster session, involving a short row
from IC’s Putney boathouse, followed
by beers and a barbeque on the club’s
balcony overlooking the Thames. The
evening was completed with a recruit-
ment push to South Kensington’s fin-
est drinking establishment: IC Union.
Social Secretary Adam Freeman-Pask
took the lead with his ‘active recruit-
ment’ techniques, which involved en-
couraging willing victims to consume
from a ‘3 and a half pint’ oar.

Imperial rowers annihilate University of London

For the senior squad, the first month’s
training of the year culminated last
weekend in ‘Fours Head’, the third-big-
gest race of the year, on the Thames be-
tween Chiswick and Putney. The event
had a total of more than 500 boats rac-
ing, with Imperial entering eight boats.
Of these, the top boat (a senior 1 quad)
won its event in style, finishing 6th
overall among world-class opposition.
Subsequently mentioned strokeman
Adam Freeman-Pask found it “difficult
to keep it long and hard for the whole
19 minutes, and the last few strokes re-
ally finished me off.”
The top women’s quad placed fourth
out of 39 in their highly competitive
event, whilst the 1st and 2nd men’s
coxed fours both came close seconds
in their events, putting all 3 boats in a
good position to move on from during
the rest of the term. Three other men’s
Toga Party’ happily coincided with
England’s Rugby World Cup victory
over France, thus setting up the night
perfectly for the many who were in at-
tendance. The combination of sport-
ing victory, togas and unlimited booze
made for an (if you will forgive the
mild hyperbole) epic party, the events
of which will not be printed on the re-
spectable pages of Felix. It is safe to say
however, for those who had to train at
7am, the following morning was suit-
ably painful.
To finish off the ‘Fresher’s Month’,
a ‘Splash, Dash and, er….Get Lashed’
event was held on the last Sunday of
October, with the magical combina-
tion of fancy dress, rowing on the
Thames and beers (not necessarily in
that order). The day gave a first taste
of racing to our new freshers, most of
whom have not rowed before coming
to Imperial. This leads me briefly to
the training; since around two-thirds
of our new members have never rowed
before, there is a steep learning curve
in the coming months.
boats and a second women’s quad also
had excellent races, finishing high. All
IC crews overtook those ahead of them
and, according to Tom Sutherland
(mid-race to Cambridge Uni Light-
weights), “if you’re that slow, you don’t
deserve the racing line!”
In his pre-race speech, head coach
Simon Cox emphasised the need to
better University of London Boat Club
in the final results, stating (with tongue
firmly in cheek), “if they die, they die.”
Meanwhile: the social side...
Crucially, every Imperial College boat
beat its equivalent University of Lon-
don boat, comprehensively. While UL
has had pretensions in the past as be-
ing the best student boat-club on the
Thames, IC has been able to shatter
their illusions in the same year as Im-
perial declared its independence from
UL. In the words of Ole Tietz, club
captain and stroke of the top IC four,
“It’s important that these people know
we are not f***ing around!”
