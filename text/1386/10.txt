Chris Larvin (Deputy President Finance
& Services) and I have come up with the
idea of being in the Student Activities
Centre from 10:30 to 13:30 Wednesday
lunchtimes for our new Clubs & Societies
Surgery. We wanted to be in the same
place at the same time to answer any
queries, questions, or random thoughts
that Club Officers as we are often busy
in meetings or committees and unable
to be in the Office at the same time. We
hope that you will find this arrangement
much more convenient for all of you,
but don’t forget that we can always be
contacted by phone or email throughout
the week.

What else am I doing?
I have recently finished an electronic
version of the income and claim forms
for Clubs & Societies whilst I am writing
a database which receives the forms
submitted and inputs them into our
finance system. This will save the Club
Officers time and effort with all their
transactions and hopefully speed the
system up so the online finances are
more accurate.
In the last Clubs
and Societies
Board meeting all
the winter tour
proposals were
discussed. A tour is
a trip away which
a Club or Society
cannot usually
do due to time
constraints or the
distance to the
destination. A few
of the destinations
that clubs are going to this year include
Scotland, Barbados, and France.
The first Health and Safety Committee
meeting is going to be Monday the 12th
at that staff and students can change
unsafe working practices. The Health
and Safety Committee considers and
monitors Health and Safety issues
in the Union and advises on the
appropriateness and adequacy of current
Health and Safety policies and practices.
So far this year the New Clubs
Committee has set up eight new clubs.
They were Indoor Hockey, Gymnastics,
Racing Green, Stop the War, Atheist and
Agnostic, Medical Humanities, Christian
Medical Fellowship, and Consultancy
Society. They are in the process of
setting up websites so if any of these
clubs sound interesting then email
dpcs@imperial.ac.uk and I can put you in
contact with the committees.

This Wednesday lunchtime will see the
first Trading Forum of the year, which
is your opportunity to have a moan and
make some suggestions about the way
we run our bars and catering outlets.
It will be run in the Union Bar between
12:00 and 13:00 and we will be providing
sandwiches and snacks.
First off, you should know a little about
our trading outlets which include our
bars, entertainments program and
catering outlets. In South Kensington
we have The Union Bar, Da Vinci’s and
dBs, as well as the Reynolds Bar at
Charing Cross Hospital. Our catering
outlets in South Kensington are located
in dBs and DaVinci’s and serve hot
and cold food between 8:30 am until
9:00 pm. Our Entertainments program
includes Freshers Week, Sin City on
a Wednesday, Too Posh to Wash, Bar
FTSE and our end of term carnivals.
They are operated for the benefit of the
students, however we can only solve
problems if we know they exist, and we
rely on our customers, i.e. you, to tell us
where we are going wrong and how we
can improve.
Here are some questions to ask
yourself…
• Are you missing Lowenbrau? Come
and find out why it left the Union this
summer.
• Have you been working behind the bar
for years and think you understand what
our students want? Come along and
share your wisdom.
• Does the queue
for the bar make
you want to shoot
yourself in the
face?
• Is the bar missing
your favourite real
ale?
• Do you like the
lunchtime offer? Is
the range extensive
enough?
• Would you like to
see table service introduced?
• What would you like us to sell? How
much would you pay for it?
• Did you enjoy Freshers’ Week?
• Are you wishing we provided more
entertainments for the non-drinkers?
• Do you want to see entertainments run
on a Saturday night?
• What would you like to see at the
Christmas Carnival?
You can also come along and find out
more about the venue; are you happy
with the new awning in the Quad?
This is your chance to get your questions
answered by the people who make the
decisions. So come along if you want
to make a change in your Union and get
some free food while you’re at it.
If you can’t make it, remember you can
always email dpfs@imperial.ac.uk or
trading@imperial.ac.uk with your gripes.
