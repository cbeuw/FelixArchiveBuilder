Dramsoc’s bloody Halloween treat
Detective Richard Lai investigates this year’s Dramsoc Freshers’ Play, ‘Dial M for Murder’... Ring ring!
D
ramSoc’s opening play of
the year is the late Fre-
derick Knott’s murder
mystery thriller, “Dial M
for Murder”, directed by
Fran Buckland. This was brought to us
in its original flavour with no moderni-
sation or any fantasy costumes.
We are sat in front of a London flat
in the 50s, where resident Tony – a
former British tennis player – uses his
old colleague, Lesgate, to plot the “per-
fect murder” against his loaded wife,
Sheila, whom he knows is having an
affair with Max, a crime story writer.
However, with Inspector Hubbard’s
sharp detection and Max’s clever de-
ciphering, Tony’s supposedly compli-
cated plan starts to collapse.
Being a freshers’ play, it is no surprise
to see unfamiliar faces in the cast list of
six. However, it did not take long for
me to start liking them. It was obvi-
ous that George Koulouris, who plays
Tony, has a fair amount of acting expe-
rience: he was able maintain the same
character throughout the play, and the
posh British accent he put on should
also be credited – it somehow charmed
the audience. However, because of his
consistency, he had already revealed
his evil side right from the beginning.
Don’t get me wrong though: George is
a great actor, but it’s just that I’d like
to see more of a double-character for a
greater suspension at the beginning.
David Stacey’s brainy Max was also
one of my favourites. With his intel-
lectual lines right from the start, and
a slight desperation for Sheila, there
is no reason to blame Sheila for liking
this man. David’s lively character was
also what kept the audience focused
and excited. I really look forward to see
him in a comedy someday.
While Sheila and Max were out, Tony
summoned Joscha Diehl’s Lesgate for a
car trade, but in fact he just wanted to
blackmail Lesgate to commit a murder.
Lesgate was a perfect, stone-cold (al-
though unsuccessful) assassin, but per-
haps a bit shy. I also struggled to hear
his words in his meeting with Tony.
Again, like Tony’s character, he could
use some more flexibility to reflect his
cunningness, but this is really not bad
for a virgin actor – I see great potential.
It will be good to see how far he goes in
the next production.
Sheila, played by Nada Jumabhoy,
was slightly disappointing. I remember
deeply that in her conversation with
Max at the beginning, it sounded as
if she was just reading her lines. What
put me off later was how she reacted
after the attempted murder: nothing.
There was no sign of guilt on her face,
after she reversed the killing and let
Lesgate’s bloody body lie on the floor.
She was not even close to crying. It just
didn’t feel natural at all. A more thor-
ough preparation and direction would
have eliminated this.
In the second half of the show, In-
spector Hubbard, played by the charm-
ing Gilead Amit, turned up in Tony’s
flat. I was impressed by his profession-
alism as an inspector on stage, doing
all the right things that a real inspector
would do, even down to the tiniest de-
tails. And slightly off-topic: if I had not
read about him in the cast list, I would

Dramatic, terrible and my favourite. Good old Tennyson shows us how it’s done with the Charge of the
Light Brigade. I want to see you all reading this a lot around campus in your best theatrical voices!
This famous charge took place during
the battle of Balaklava, 25th October
1854. Under mistaken orders - ‘Some
one had blunder’d’ - the Earl of Car-
digan, with his Light Brigade of 607
horsemen, rode up a valley, manned
in front and on both flanks by Russian
guns and masses of Russian soldiers,
Of the 607 troopers, 409 fell and only
198 escaped. A bloody massacre, re-
ally. Here endeth the lesson. That’s all
for this week, kiddies.
Half a league, half a league,
Half a league onward,
All in the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
‘Forward, the Light Brigade!
‘Charge for the guns!’ he said:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
‘Forward, the Light Brigade!’
Was there a man dismay’d?
Not tho’ the soldier knew
Some one had blunder’d:
Their’s not to make reply,
Their;s not to reason why,
Their’s but to do and die:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon in front of them
Volley’d and thunder’d;
Storm’d at with shot and shell,
Boldly they rode and well,
Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of Hell
Rode the six hundred.
Flash’d all their sabres bare,
Flash’d as they turn’d in air,
Sabring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while
All the world wonder’d:
Plunged in the battery-smoke
Right thro’ the line they broke;
Cossack and Russian
Reel’d from the sabre-stroke
Shatter’d and sunder’d.
Then they rode back, but not
Not the six hundred.
Cannon to the right of them,
Cannon to the left of them,
Cannon behind them
Voley’d and thunder’d;
Storm’d at with shot and shell,
While horse and hero fell,
They that had fought so well
Came thro’ the jaws of Death
Back from the mouth of Hell,
All that was them of them,
Left of six hundred.
Whe can their glory fade?
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wonder’d.
Honour the charge they made!
Honour the Light Brigade,
Noble six Hundred!
have thought he was English rather
than “Switzeraeli”!
A comedy moment arrived when
Max turned up alone in front of Tony,
excitedly spelling out his “own” story
that coincidentally matched the truth,
hoping that Tony would give this to the
police, which might rescue Sheila from
her death sentence, although having to
puthimselfintoprison.Ofcourse,Tony
had no interest in saving Shelia any-
way and shooed Max away with slight
panic, but luckily Hubbard’s mind was
on the same frequency as Max’s, so the
two teamed up (not intentionally) and
eventually caught Tony red-handed.
Last but not least, we have the leg-
endary Sir Walter Plinge’s Williams,
whose manly voice could be heard
from the back when responding Hub-
bard, but his body never appeared on
stage. The reason? It will remain a
mystery.
Overall, it is an excellent produc-
tion with a great stage set-up and some
great performances, perfect for a light
evening. Technically there were no
major flaws either, so well done to the
backstage crew. If you missed out on
this production, have no fear: hope-
fully DramSoc’s next production will
show their real capability with the rest
of their veteran members.
Always a good evening’s enter-
tainment! Dramsoc’s next play is
‘Translations’ and runs from 28th
November to 1st December.
