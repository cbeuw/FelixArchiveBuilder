Bumbags/Fannypacks
Did you know that fanny
means bum in America? How
confusing! That could get you
into a bad situation if you’re
into dirty talk. Although if you
refer to your hooha as a fanny
in dirty talk context, you prob-
ably have other problems.
Blackout
It’s the musical equivalent
of an upper. Also, since you
can download music online,
you don’t have to face the
shame of handing the CD to a
cashier at Virgin Megastores.
I always find it random that
record stores seem to have a
policy of hiring radical looking
people. I guess like people,
corporations try to pretend
exactly what they’re not. But
remember, you can never plug
the abyss in your dark soul.
You also have to live with the
knowledge that by buying this
CD you will be funding Brit-
ney’s Cheeto fund.
Pete Doherty’s Relapse
He was just starting to move
past the pillsbury dough boy
stage into looking like an ac-
tual human being.

Super-Awesome Waist-Skirt
This is really easy to make. Well unless you sew the seam
on the wrong side of the skirt. Then you’ll have to spend
half an hour unpicking stiches sewn in from the smallest
stitch setting of the sewing machine. All you need is a sew-
ing machine, jersey cotton fabric, matching thread, and
waistband elastic.
1. Measure around your waist where you want your skirt
to sit. Multiply this length by 1.7. This is the width of your
fabric. Measure how long you want your skirt, then add on
3 inches for the length of your fabric.
2. Mesure and cut your fabric into the desired
dimensions.
3. Fold your fabric in half, with the good sides facing ea-
chother. Sew along this to make a tube.
4. Fold up and sew the hem.
5. Fold down the top of the skirt, making a tube big enough
to fit your waistband elastic. Sew along this, making sure
the tube is still wide enough.
6. Cut your elastic to a bit smaller than the size of your
waist.
7. Pin a safety pin on the end of the waistband elastic. In-
sert the waistband through the hole you unpicked, using
the safety pin to pull the fabric over the elastuc.
8. Sew together the ends of the elastic band.
9. Hand sew back up the hole where your inserted the
elastic.
10. Turn your skirt the right way out. Awesome!
