We arrived at Harlington for our first
ULU match of the season, psyched up
for a hard match against UCL, who
beat us 51-5 last year.
The warm-up was a very long one, as
UCL did not arrive until 15 minutes af-
ter the supposed kick off time of 14:30.
This did not put us off however, and
within the first 10 minutes we were
7-0 up, following a turnover ball out
of a ruck thanks to a fantastic effort by
the forwards, and being run down the
wing by Jess to score under the posts.
Two extra points were won off the foot
of Roxanne.
UCL hit back hard and were award-
ed for their efforts with a try, but no
conversion making the score 7-5. The
game was heavily dominated by for-
ward-play, with lots of driving mauls
and hard rucks. The second try for IC
was scored by Sam, running down the
blindside following a maul, with a sec-
ond conversion from Roxanne. UCL
then succeeded in scoring another try,
but again missed the conversion to
bring the half-time score to 14-10.
In the second half we made a couple
of changes, bringing new Virgin Jane
into inside centre and Emilie onto the
wing. Our forwards then managed to

The season had not started too well
for the Ladies 2nd’s but Halloween
Wednesday saw a break in the slump
with a gripping win against Sussex La-
dies 2nd’s. Having kept adrenaline high
with some nude photo shoots, we went
into the game with great anticipation.
The team had many new faces and a
new layout formulated by the stand-in
captain Dominator.
The first half started solidly with
lots of well calculated passes and well
aimed hit-outs. However, the ball was
barely seen in our attacking half as
Sussex started fast and intercepted the
ball. Some good stops from Spanner
saved any damage to the score sheet
and at half-time the match was still
goal-less.
A stirring half time chat and oranges
led to a more fired-up Imperial side
in the second half. All was going well
until we went 1-0 down due to a slight
oversight which earned Hoover ‘Twat
of the Match’! Things turned around
though when Dominator scored an
inspiring P-flick. Some good commu-
nication and stick-work between the
midfield and attack led to a second
goal scored by fresher Isabel.
Good defence on the back line kept
any more Sussex goal attempts from
coming to anything and the end result
was maintained at 2-1. ‘Man of the
win the ball from a UCL scrum leading
to a break away run by outside centre
Sam, closely supported by Courtney
who touched the ball down across the
line giving us a 21-10 lead. Soon after,
UCL fought hard and managed to up
their score to 21-17. This was to be
the final score for the game, but with
25 minutes still left to play, the Virgins
had their defensive skills put to the test
with a nail biting 15 minutes keeping
UCL literally 5 metres from the line.
Well done to everyone for such a
well-fought game and deserved win.
Also well done to Theresa, Bonnie,
Sara, Camilla and Courtney who man-
aged to win us 2 bottles of champagne
in Havana’s by beating 4 other teams in
a boat race, with opposition including
IC and Medic Rugby boys!
