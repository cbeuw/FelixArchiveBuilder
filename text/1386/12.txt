The fact that pigeons roam free wher-
ever they please, as if they lord the
land, leads Cronin to make the bold
statement: “Maybe it is actually you
who crosses the PIGEONS path”. With
“Pigeon” Cronin really makes the read-
er take a step back, and review their
perceptions. Such is the philosophical
edginess of this piece.
To what purpose Cronin will aim
his creative genius next remains to be
seen. What we can be certain of is that
his artwork will continue to be ground-
breaking, crossing new bridges in his
grand vision for artistic perfection.
This week’s commentary is by
Scott Greening. He recently com-
pleted his dissertation on Jack’s
Poetry. Scott wishes to study
Dirty Pigeon for his PhD but
is still waiting for funding.
Good luck Scotty.
ing as any fashion-forward yet rela-
tively down-to-earth girl would ever
want. His famous prints are gorgeous
too – you are treated to an overview
of the deceptively difficult process
the aesthetic demands to achieve the
perfection of some of his designs, and
dedicated fashionistas and fans will
recognise many of the designs, includ-
ing the striking peacock-feather de-
sign and the palm and leaf design that
showed at Olympus Fashion Week not
too long ago.
Though stunning, stretching it as far
as “iconic” is tenuous. The exhibition
comes off as unjus-
tifiably egocentric
when you consider
that the rest of the
museum is taken
up with someone
as dramatic as
Zaha Hadid,
and that the
truly iconic
exhibition
is residing
somewhere
on Cromwell
Road at the V&A. There, the hype was
justified. Here, the exhibition comes
off as little more than a token gesture
of congratulation for what is essen-
tially a relatively medium-term level of
success and canny PR, the equivalent
of following The Beatles’ greatest hits
with something substantial, yet pal-
ing in comparison, re: The Libertines,
or perhaps Groove Armada. It doesn’t
stand up.
And in isolation, the exhibition feels
like more of an exercise in engaging
or introducing a new audience to the
world of design – though a terrific and
laudable thing in the long run, for the
purist will hardly appeal – a case of
compromising the art to make a crowd
clap in the most hackneyed manner, so
to speak. Most discount fashion and
even design as valid art forms, so how
far can you push to make the most friv-
olous end of the spectrum seem legiti-
mate? And was Williamson really the
best choice to represent fashion in the
arena of design?
On the one hand, one hardly feels the
envelope being tugged when viewing
his clothes. On the other, as a conduit
for opening the glam squad to the idea
of fashion as more than
fun and games (read:
packing them in), he
was ideal – it is a pleas-
ant introduction, just
engaging enough while
serving up a healthy
scoop of eye candy.
But it’s not to say we
couldn’t do better. The
hype, the buzz and ex-
citement – this is part
of the Williamson ex-
perience. There were
more deserving can-
didates – Lanvin and
Giles for example – but
as ever, the Matthew
Williamson publicity
machine keeps soldier-
ing on. And after a while, everyone will
believe the hype.
Matthew Williamson’s “Greatest
Hits” are on display at the Design
Museum until the 31st January.
Entry is £7 and you get to see the
entire museum for that. Brill.

F
inally it’s my favourite sea-
son, autumn. Took them
bloody long enough, but
now we have those beautiful
fiery colours lining the trees
as we traverse to college each morning.
I knew autumn was definately here ear-
lier this morning when I was twatted
round the face by a MASSIVE falling
sycamore leaf as I was cycling my way
to lectures. It not only woke me up but
really put a smile on my face! Autumn
leaves do it for me.
However, my northern blood tells
me it just isn’t cold enough. In Novem-
ber, I expect my fingers to be falling off
with frostbite and by breath to be vis-
ible when you exhale. Remember when
you were little and you used to do that
to pretend you were either a dragon, or
smoking... depending on how much of
a childhood you actually had.
And speaking of childhood, we all
used to enjoy a good day out when
we were kiddly-winkles - just you and
Mummy and Daddy (or possibly Dad-
dy and Daddy) and a day of frolicking
in the autumn leaves. I miss that.
However we can all make up for this
loss by spending the day at one of these
wonderful institutions showcased in
this week’s Arts Pages. Emily Wilson
spent the day in the National Portrait
Gallery to see the highly acclaimed Pop
Art Portraits exhibitons. If you are un-
sure as to what this is, you will surely
have heard of those infamous Marilyn
Monroe portaits. Times this by 10 and
you have yourself a Pop Art exhibiton.
Sorted.
Meanwhile, David Paw immersed
himself in prints, glorious prints at the
Design Museum and broadway-guru-
Lucy Harrold went off-Westend to see
a premiere of hot, new musical, John
and Jen.
I hope you enjoy this week’s Stanzas
for Students. You must be familar with
those period dramas on the tellybox
and how they sat around in the eve-
nings reading verse to each other. Po-
etry was made to be read aloud and in
order to demonstrate this I chose this
fabulously bloody poem, The Charge
of the Light Brigade. The verses are
so rhythmic; but to get across the can-
tering horses carrying their riders to
their death you are required to read it
at high speed. This normally leads to
wild arm movements, so due to health
and safety precautions, please leave a
radius of arm’s length around you be-
fore commencing.
It is now over halfway through term
and ‘tis the season to attend concerts
and plays given by our fellow students
here at Imperial. There are choirs, or-
chestras, theatrical-types and all sorts
to be entertaining yourself with. Next
week’s issue will include a handy calen-
dar of all events coming up so you can’t
possibly forget!
If there is anything you want us to in-
clude or you would like to review, let us
know. Until then my pretties, stay cul-
tured and happy. And respect those pi-
geons. Especially the dirty ones. They
want love and attention, just like you.
Better than Topshop. Fact
David Paw reviews Runway Royal, Matthew Williamson’s brand new exhibition
“T
his overview will
present his most
iconic designs.” So
the blurb went.
Prints. Colour.
More prints. Then came
an array of said iconic de-
signs. You couldn’t really
fault the designs for what
they were. Rationalising
Williamson’s unadulter-
ated flair for fashion of the
most frivolous, effeminate
and playful variety into
something verging on the
intellectual would be like
trying to rebrand Topshop
as something runway wor-
thy or something high-
en…oh wait, they’re still
trying to do that.
Williamson knows his
audience. The fashion
world knows his audience
and what he stands for.
However, I’m not quite sure the De-
sign Museum has been let in on this.
Graduating from the hallowed ground
of Central St Martins in 1994, a chance
encounter with socialite-cum-journal-
ist-cum-writer Plum Sykes (I’m not
sure Bergdorf Blondes counts as litera-
ture) led to the creation of his first col-
lection in 1997.
Tagged Electric Angels, it was the
beginning of a dizzyingly rapid rise.
Numbers were dialled, favours were
called in and on the day some of the
industry’s most renowned attended a
show modelled by the likes of Helena
Christensen and Jade Jagger. Contacts
were made, networks were spread and
buzz generated, and ten years later
Williamson and partner Joseph Velosa
are sat on top of a multimillion dollar
brand. Williamson is now at the helm
of Pucci and released his very own fra-
grance last year. Luxury conglomerate
LVMH is rumoured to be rapping po-
litely on his door.
Allthisfromatightfocusonprints,an
imaginative and unabashed penchant
for vibrant colour and a keen busi-
ness acumen built up from a successful
partnership with Velosa. Oh, and those
networks.
Making
clothes
women
love to
wear can
have its
drawbacks
– they
might ac-
tually wear them.
Williamson de-
signs fashion that
is accessible and
actually wear-
able – no heavy
concepts or de-
constructionalism
here.
Understandably,
he has a client list that all but the most
established and coveted of brands can
only dream of, though this has drawn
criticism from the industry for us-
ing walking fashion billboards such
as muses Sienna Miller and Helena
Christensen to promote his clothes.
And on top of these accolades comes
a solo retrospective that resides on the
airy top floor of the Design Museum.
All ten square feet of it.
There isn’t anything wrong with the
exhibition itself as much as the hype
that surrounds it – yes, the clothes
are as beautiful, as striking and excit-
Student Art In Focus – Dirty Pigeon
This week S.A.I.F. bears great gifts from student poet, Jack E Cronin. Hear ye, hear ye
This week in “Stu-
dent Art in Focus”,
let us take a look
into poetry. Jack
E Cronin is an
experimental artist to
say the least. Cronin
was previously re-
viewed in Felix a few
weeks back, where
we took a look at a
sample of his con-
temporary collection,
‘Tom?’. While his art
errs towards the side
of minimalism, Cronin’s
poetry takes a more tradi-
tional approach.
The poem “Dirty Pigeon” at-
tempts to convey an alterna-
tive conception of London’s
attitude. It is all too easy
to want to run over pigeons
on one’s bike, or complain about
the pigeon as being nothing bet-
ter than an annoyingly frequent
pest. However, typical of Cronin,
whose reputation is growing by
the day, he questions these com-
mon perceptions. The line
“Free to roam wherever it
feels” really emphasizes
the freedom of the
pigeon, in com-
parison to the
utilitarian
lifestyles
of Lon-
doners.
Dirty Pigeon
You duck away as the dirty pigeon
with ruffled feathers flies past your
path,
Its a dirty flying rat you see.
You are blind to it until it passes by
YOU.
Why would you notice?
It has no friends,
No reason to live. In your view.
Why is this so?
Does it not keep the company of the
open sky?
Free to roam wherever it feels.
No boundaries.
No expectations.
Unrestricted.
Who really lives the better life?
Maybe it is actually you who crosses
the PIGEONS path.
