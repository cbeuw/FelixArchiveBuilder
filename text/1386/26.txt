“rati” means “the highest love for God”
in Sanskrit. Aarti is also performed
to ward off evil effects and the influ-
ence of the “evil eye”. After the song,
the plate that holds the candles is cir-
culated to all present for the perform-
ance of a purificatory blessing. In the
low lighting of the Great Hall, candles
flickered on the trays and everyone
stood in a semi-circle around the stat-
ue of ShreeKrishna, singing the prayer.
It was a very spiritual and special part
of the evening.
After the Aarti was the perform-
ing of the Dandyia Raas or the Sword
Dance. This is the staging of a mock-
fight between the Goddess and Mahi-
shasura, the mighty demon-king. The
colourfully decorated sticks or dandi-
yas, represent the sword of Durga. The
music has a strong drum beat, which
the dancers stamp their feet and beat
the sticks to. The music gradually gets
faster and faster, and the dance, more
and more complicated and energetic,
and lasts for about an hour! How some
dancers kept going was beyond me!
Ajay Gandhi described the Garba as
“the most successful garba in our his-
tory, breaking new ground by includ-
ing an educational video to rejuvenate
a new generation of young Hindus with
a beat of passion and whirlwind of col-
our and music”. A raffle, in which the
first prize was a cricket bat signed by
the 2007 Indian Cricket Team, raised
over £1500 for two charities: CARE
Education and Ekal Vidyala. I had an
amazing night, totally different to any
experience that I have had before. It
was truly memorable! I wish to thank
Hindu Soc for inviting me and making
sure that I had a great time!
