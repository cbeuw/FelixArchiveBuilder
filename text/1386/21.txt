Rub a dub pub grub
A normal place with excellent normal food: The Queen’s Arms
Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding
(serves 5 – 6), by Sally Longstaff
Vegetarian phase over. Here’s a recipe for some good old red meat – Enjoy!
Nothing can beat a nice Sunday
Roast, especially the traditional
roast beef with Yorkshire puds.
For those non-UK students out
there, this is a must – British
cooking at its very best!
Most people think that a roast
dinner is difficult to cook. Well,
it’s not actually that tough for
even the most culinary chal-
lenged of you. This is a great way
to impress your own parents with
how you are coping with the big
wide world and will earn a ton of
brownie points, or even your girl-
friend/girlfriend’s parents.
You’ll need: A roasting dish,
saucepans (minimum of 2) and a
jug.
Ingredients:
1.25kg joint of beef (back rib, top-
side or silverside), 100g plain flour,
1 egg beaten, 300ml milk, 200g po-
tatoes per person, 400g parsnips,
gravy granules, 400g carrots, pack
of sugar snap peas, oil, salt and
pepper.
Method:
Pre-heat the oven to 220/Gas Mark
7. Rinse the joint and pat dry. Sea-
son the joint and place in roasting
pan.
Roast for one hour for rare meat
(15 minutes plus 15 minutes per
500g), or 1 hour 20 minutes for
medium meat (20 minutes plus 20
minutes per 500g). For well-done
meat cook for 1 hour 40 minutes
(25 minutes plus 25 minutes per
500g). For the rest of the timings
below, I have assumed medium
cooking time of 1h 20 mins.
Wash and peel the potatoes,
whilst bringing a kettle of water to
the boil. Cut the potatoes into even-
sized pieces and boil in a saucepan
for 5-10 minutes or until they lose
a little of their hardness. Drain and
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook
in the roasting pan with the meat
for 1-1.5 hours depending on how
crispy you like them. For the rest of
the timings below, I have assumed
medium cooking time.
Cut both ends of the parsnips and
peel. Slice in half, and cut into ba-
tons of even size. Par-boil, as you
did with the potatoes (you can do
them together to save on washing
up!). Roast with the potatoes for
the same amount of time.
For the Yorkshire puddings, sift
the flour and salt into a mixing
bowl. Make a well in the centre of
the flour and pour in the egg and
half the milk. Mix the liquid into
the flour until a smooth batter is
formed. Use an electric whisk if
necessary. Gradually beat in the
rest of the milk. Put a little oil in
each of the holes in a twelve-hole
bun tin.
Put the tin into the oven for a few
minutes to heat the oil. Fill the bun
tin with the batter. Cook with the
roast for 20 minutes, or until the
puddings are golden. Alternatively
use Aunty Bessie’s frozen puds,
they are amazing – just pop them
on a baking tray in the foil dishes
for about 12-15 minutes.
Top and tail the carrots (i.e. chop
off the top and bottom) and slice
thinly. Boil in water in a saucepan
for 10-15 minutes or steam for 10-
15 minutes depending on how soft
you like them. Steam or boil the
sugar snap peas for 4-5 minutes.
Time-plan to eat at 8.00pm:
6:30 Peel and boil the pota-
toes and parsnips.
6:40 Rinse and dry the meat.
Put the meat, potatoes
and parsnips in the
oven.
Now you can relax for a bit and
lay the table, wash up, pour wine
(red wine is recommended, for
example, Shiraz).
7:30 Begin making Yorkshire
puddings and warm the
bun tin.
7:40 Put the Yorkshire pud-
dings into the oven.
7:45 Peel carrots and boil.
7.55 Put sugar snap peas on
to boil/steam.
8:00 Serve.
Fancy some goat?

So, the authentic creative gastropubs
(whom I adore) are pushing up the
prices of the bad normal pubs because
people now think fish and chips is
worth twenty quid, and the still-cheap
chain pubs are pretending to be gas-
tropubs by giving you a big plate. Fine.
I don’t like it, but I get it. What’s the
implicit tragedy? – That there are no
normal pubs selling normal food of
gastropub quality at a reasonable price.
Wrong! There is the Queen’s Arms in
Queens Gate Mews, just a short walk
from campus!
It’s a simple point I have to make
about it: the food is completely stand-
ard pub fare on paper (including such
menu staples as bangers and mash,
burgers, steak and chips), but is actu-
ally executed to a very high standard…
normal pub food at gastropub qual-
ity! That’s pretty special if you ask me.
Others seem to agree judging from
its popularity with a civilised crowd
of students and Albert Hall goers, all
spilling out onto the beautiful cobbled
mews.
We fought over our starter of bread-
ed calamari with sweet chilli and rock-
et (my mouth is watering right now
whilst thinking about it). The girl I
was with is greedy, so she had a steak.
I stole some and it was richly bloody.
I was drunk so craved the macaroni
cheese- plus I was just ecstatic to see
it on a menu; and my craving was more
than satisfied.
So hurrah for the London Pub! Bring
back porridge and kippers for break-
fast, kedgeree for lunch and toad-in-
the-hole for supper, I say. Then the
only tragedy will be the lack of dart
S
uppose you are a homosex-
ual gearing up for a night of
mayhem on or around Old
Compton Street. Suppose
further (which is even more
unlikely) that you are not a member
of the white T-shirt brigade that sur-
vives on a diet of cocktails and the mi-
niscule piece of nutrition provided by
a sugar-coated ecstasy tab. You may
therefore wish to eat more than half a
won-ton before precipitating yourself
in the crazy world of gay. Perhaps, for
example, you are a ‘bear’. Then a cheap
and decent, filling meal on Dean Street
courtesy of Mr Jerk might be just the
thing for you.
About six or seven years ago, by my
recollection, there was suddenly an
epidemic of Caribbean takeaways; one
appearing on every high street when
there were previously none. Most of
these are (or were) crap- the cheap-
est possible chunks of meat in insipid
sauces served on a mound of stodgy
‘rice&peas’ is the staple offering. Mr
Jerk, (which now has two branches:
‘Original Mr Jerk’ and ‘Jerk City’) is the
single source of good Caribbean food
in the West End. Indeed, with the ex-
ception of the more upmarket opera-
tions like the Mango Room and Cot-
tons in Camden, it’s the only decent
venue in Zone 1.
Saltfish and Ackee is a traditional
Carribean offering - fish is preseved
in salt then rehydrated and cooked
with an otherwise tasteless fruit, ac-
kee - which comes in an intensely rich
version here with the saltfish dutifully
soaked and cooked until falling apart,
as it should be. The goat curry is ex-
ceptionally flavoursome too and the
sauce was pleasantly soaked up by the
‘hard food’ accompaniment. But the
real draw is of course the eponymous
jerk chicken which blackened to within
an inch of charcoal, comes doused in a
seriously hot and sour sauce which is
as good a decongestant as friar’s bal-
sam. It sounds horrible but it’s refresh-
ing and unspeakably tasty. If you fancy
sampling the fare while passing, grab
one of the saltfish dumplings for three
pounds or so, sitting in the hot shelf by
the window. They’re sensational.
A main meal is about £7 plus drinks.
