Double phew.
Council increases by eight...
...but hardly anybody turns up to hear the outcome of the results
Last week, the Council and Trustee
Board elections came to a close with
many positions remaining unfilled
partly due to an initial lack of partici-
pation but also because RON (re-open
nominations) beat some of the can-
didates. In total, Council has gained
eight more members whilst the Trus-
tee Board has added one more to its
committee.
Before voting had even begun, it was
known that there would be vacancies
on Council. Some positions were not
even contested; postgraduate repre-
sentation was especially dismal with
only one PhD student running.
The majority of the results were an-
nounced in dB’s last Friday at lunch-
time, to an audience of approximately
six people as well as the handful of stu-
dents who just happened to be sinking
their teeth into a bite to eat. Unsurpris-
ingly the student body didn’t flock in
droves to be a part of the nail-biting
climax to a month’s worth of non-ex-
istent campaigning. The lack of candi-
dates waiting to hear their fate, how-
ever, was more worrying and begs the
question: did those students even care
whether they won a place on Council
or not? Either that or the Union has
done an incredibly lousy job of email-
ing people to tell them when the results
were going to be released. Neverthe-
less, the committee has gained a hand-
ful of new members who will hopefully
bring some much needed debate to the
monthly meetings.
A flattering two thousand votes
were cast individually, but overall the
turnout was low with the most suc-
cessful candidate receiving 74 votes. A
breakdown of the results can be found
elsewhere on the page. There were a
few surprises in the Undergraduate
Engineering Councillor and the Trus-
tee Board categories where this year’s
RON representative, RON Weasley,
managed to vanquish three foes with
his magic wand. These positions will
be recontested at the next Council
meeting along with the other out-
standing places. A by-election will be
run, whereby people will turn up to the
Council meeting and put themselves
forward to be on the committee.
If you were completely unaware the
election had even happened and you
have a burning desire to be on Coun-
cil or the Trustee Board, come along
to the next meeting in the Union Din-
ing Hall on Monday 10th December at
6:30pm. There were some rather tasty
pastries at the last meeting so what
have you got to lose?

Halt the Beit redevelopment
project or run the gauntlet?
Once again, Beit was the main point of
discussion at the most recent meeting
of the Executive (Exec) committee. The
Union is in somewhat of a quandary;
whether or not to go ahead with the
second phase of the Beit Masterplan.
The Masterplan is the long-term
redevelopment plan to update Beit’s
facilities. The first phase was com-
pleted last academic year when da-
Vinci’s was refurbished and a lift was
installed in the Union’s main entrance.
Several weeks ago Felix reported on
the revelation that funding for the first
phase came from the Union’s General
Reserve, a very large pot of money in-
tended for use in the event of a catas-
trophe. The money for Phase 1 should
never have been authorised to come
from this reserve in the first place.
Now however, the Union is debating
whether to deplete the General Reserve
even more in order to fund the second
phase of the Masterplan which will see
a massive redesign of the Union offices
including a sparkling new Student Ac-
tivities Centre, to replace the existing
one in the East Basement of Beit Quad
as well as a new gymnasium and activ-
ity space on the third floor.
College has said that it is happy to
give over £1.4m to fund the second
phase, however the Union needs to
stump up the rest of the cash: around
£1.7m. In a report to Exec, the Union
President Stephen Brown wrote that
“we are confident … that Union Re-
serves could be used to fund £1.2m of
our share”.
If the full amount is used, the Union
would be left with a severely compro-
mised General Reserve. Even then,
the Union is £500k short of the total
amount it needs to raise. Mr Brown
continued by stating that the differ-
ence would have to be made up over a
period of 19 months using “other rev-
enue streams within the Union” such
as trading and entertainment. The
£1.2m figure is not set in stone how-
ever. For instance, it was suggested at
Exec that a smaller proportion of the
Reserve could be taken meaning even
more money would need to be gener-
ated from other revenue streams.
Either way, if a decision to go ahead
with the redevelopment is taken, the
Union may be forced to call upon Col-
lege for help should it encounter finan-
cial difficulty further down the line,
something that many fear may com-
promise ICU’s independence from IC.
There are also further complications
involving building interest rates that
have increased the cost by roughly 10 –
15% since the initial plans were drawn
up two years ago. The Presidents will
have to dig even deeper down the
backs of their sofas.
The general response from Executive
committee members and observers at
the meeting was one of caution, that
the Union should tread carefully and
not rush into a decision.
And, finally, what about the third and
final phase of the Masterplan – the re-
development of dB’s? Just don’t ask.
What do you think? Should the
Union go ahead with the second
phase or should it save its pen-
nies? Email comment.felix@impe-

Is it the end of the line for the Beit
redevelopment?
