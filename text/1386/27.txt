Fun & Games
Virgo
This week you sit
next to Rosie as she
lays out her page.
It’s rather arousing
you think out loud
as you tell her about
writing the Virgo horoscope. She turns to you
and sort of grins slash appears completely
and utterly horrified. The horoscope becomes
horribly self referential, a term accused of
being previously overused. Nevertheless, you
soldier on like the warrior you are.
Scorpio
You hear on the
grapevine that the
world’s first and
only cataclysm of
Cadbury’s Fruit ‘n’
Nut bars is going to
be coming to a toilet pan near you on Monday
the 33rd Monday of Tuesday in and around
Decemuary. If this makes sense to you too and
isn’t just unfounded, libellous nonsense email
news.felix@imperial.ac.uk and we’ll be more
than happy to take a statement and cup size.
Libra
Tarmac is my fa-
vourite type of road.
It looks especially
attractive with that
thick white paint
they use to draw the
road lines. I just want to bend down and begin
peeling it off. I reckon there will be this really
sort of stark black colour, like when you get
tan marks after wearing a watch on holiday.
Sagittarius
This week the
ghost of Thomas
Edison visits you
in your sleep. He
tells you that he
feels ashamed of the
image that scientists possess these days. Back
in his day, he explains, scientists experimented
with all sorts of implements but now we’re
just restricted to test tube and boiling tubes, if
your passage can take it. Whatever happened
to conical flasks?
Capricorn
This week you wake
up with a distinct
Suffolk accent. You
begin to omit your
“t”s frequently and
you have a generally
eardrum piercing voice. A barman doesn’t take
kindly to your request for a glass of “war-er”
and you’re thrown out of the establishment.
3/10 horoscope, must try harder.
Cancer
Basically you’re go-
ing to die. It might
be today, it might be
tomorrow, it might
be the next day. You
don’t know, but I do!
It’s written in the stars. For £100 I can tell you
when you will die. Leave your cheques in the
Felix office and I will get back to you. I accept
no responsability, if you do in fact, die.
Gemini
On Saturday
you will feel the
uncontrollable urge
to go and spend
money in a Burberry
shop. Listen, you
chav, Burberry is not cool. Everyone who
wears Burberry should be shot and their
remains eviscerated and their heads put on
spikes outside outlets of this complete and
utter shite. Mulberry on the other hand. Now
there’s a brand
Leo
If you like a lot of
chocolate on your
biscuit, join our
Club! Treo, Treo...
I want a Treo and
I want one now!
Washing machines live longer with Calgon!
Mysterious girl, move your body close to mine.
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful... It’s true. I
saw your face in a crowded place, but I don’t
know what to do... because I’ll never be with
you.
Taurus
So... I suffered three
defeats in a row on
the fussball table
this week. How is
this acceptable? IT’S
NOT. OK. SIMPLY
NO. Enemies: you will perish at my feet as well
as the eleven sets of plastic moulded blocks on
my glorious team.
...
If Table Football Society are reading this and
think they’re hard enough: BRING IT.
Aries
If you don’t clean
your room by
Monday evening,
that mould on that
bowl of cereal will
let off its spores and
kill you. If you do, hedgehogs will eat your py-
jamas on Tuesday and your fingers with grow
long blond hair. So it’s up to you really, death
or blond hair... Tricky.
Pisces
Some people are
blessed to be in con-
tact with their fairy
godmothers. You,
on the other hand
are good friends
with the loser fairy. This week Uranus is being
stimulated by the asteroid belt and so now
would be a great time to get out of your bed-
room into the light and to get a life. Perhaps
even make a friend. Or maybe get acquainted
with a hedgehog or stoat.

The winner of the Wordoku
1,385 was Jason Klimach.

“SHORTCAKE”.

Aquarius
You were born na-
ked and screaming.
If everything goes to
plan, you’ll die that
way too. This will
be after a horrific
sexual encounter involving a shovel, KY jelly
and some microbes. If you want to live, scrub
yourslf with bleach thoroughly each time you
have sex, not forgetting the genital area. Use a
wire brush to ensure full cleansing. Yes, pipe
cleaner will suffice you skin-flint.

How to rate yourself:
Under 20 words: You are so incredibly in-
ept that I am surprised that the pressure of
the aire itsel hasn’t caved in your skull.
21 - 35 words: If brains were boats you’d
be a small dinghy. You aren’t the brightet
crayon in the box now, are you?
36 - 49 words: Getting a little better, but
still approaching the vortex of stupidity.
50 or more words: You phonological
freak!
Last week’s solution:
The two seven letter words were:
SPANDEX and EXPANDS
Congratulations if you got these.
Other words included:
ades, apes, apse, aspen, axes, deans, dens,
ends, napes, naps, neaps, pads, panes,
pans, paxes, peans, peas, pends, pens,
sand, sane, sedan, send, spade, span, sped,
spend
How to play:
Using the letters given, not more than
once, make as many words as possible.
They must be at least four or more let-
ters long and each word you come up with
must include the central letter. Capitalised
words, conjugated verbs (past tense etc),
adverbs ending in “-ly”, comparatives and
superlatives are disallowed.
An example of a word you most defi-
nitely can’t create in this particular Poly-
gon is “fluff”. Clearly, this is not possible
because you are missing the letters 3 x “f”,
“l”, and “u”.
