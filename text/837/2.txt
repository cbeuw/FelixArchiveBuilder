Drivel
Letters
Deranaged
Dear Nigel
Okay, I admit it, I am a figment
of the deranged imagination of a;
FELIX hack, who, in a moment of
stress, dreamt me up in an attempt
to fill u p a n empty space that
suddenly dropped through a freak
wormhole in space and landed in
the FELIX Office.
I really do not exist, therefore this
and any further letters purporting
to come from me are merely caused
by temporal resonances from the
original wormhole.
Yours
Dylan James
Shocked
Dear Nigel,
I a m shocked, dismayed a n d
disgusted by your continued
deliberate policy of refusing to lose
or to forget to print letters by from
Emmmannnuell Sararadakakiss. I
cannot see why, when you easily
manage to forget clubs articles by
Roger Davies, you claim not to be
able to lose letters from M r
Saradakadakis.
This is a disgraceful situation, and
unless you co-operate immediately,
I will write to the Ayatollah asking
him to have you condemned to
death.
You rs,
Alistair Goodall
Puzzled
Dear Nigel,
Something strange has just
occurred to m e , if Sidney
Harbour-Bridge hates Imperial as
much as he says he does, why has
he stayed here for six years? Could
somebody please explain this
interesting paradox to me.
Yours
Extremely puzzled
Reviews
Me and my mates went to see this
film after a night out on the town.
Actually we wanted to see '3000
Virgins', which was o n at the
Cinema next door but the Manager
took offence when we humorously
questioned his sexuality. So we
went to see this 'Snow White' thing.
Well to summarise the plot:
there's this good looking bird called
'Snow White' who lives in some
castle or the other, a bit like the one
in 'Frankenstein and the Castle of
Death'. This castle is run by some
Queen (a real one this time unlike
the manager) who spends half her
time talking to the bloody mirror. Bit
nuts, if you ask me. Funny thing is,
that the mirror talks back. N o w if I
had a talking mirror I'd sell it off
pretty damn quick, but all the queen
seems to do is ask it 'Who's the
fairest of 'em all' or something like
that. N o w its hardly surprising that
the mirror eventually geto
and tells her of this Snow Whitt 0
who's a hell of a lot hornier than she
is.
Now, I was a bit drunk and I
wasn't totally following the plot. But
as far as I can remember, Snow
White runs off into a nearby forest
and sneaks into an abandoned sort
of holiday chalet like a log cabin sort
of thing. Then there's this bit
involving lots of animals, seven
dwarvic men, and a very happy
looking Snow White. I think at this
point that I should mention that she
is a rather tasty 32:22:32, which,
although meagre for my tastes, is
quite pleasingly curvy.
N o w this queen is a nasty piece
of work; as bent as a two bob note
and a witch to top it all off. A n d she
looks like one. Well, this tart decides
to bump little Snowy off, and this
witch is dead sneeky about it.
First she gets this apple which is
half red and half green, polishes it
up nicely, then as a finishing touch
poisons the red half.
Now, this ponsey Prince arrives,
who does nothing for the storyline.
He kisses the 'dead' Snow White;
guess this g u y must be a
necrophiliac. Bet he's a bit shocked
when she wakes up and tongues
him back. M i n d you, I bet he's not
at all pissed off; who would be.
They fall in love straight away, must
be a good kisser this Prince, and she
rides off on the back of his horse.
r alto! I think she should have
siu, forest wnere there was
at least t h e ^ . seduel what
with the possibility u -
dwarvic sex. That would be beuc.
than '3000 virgins' anyday.
