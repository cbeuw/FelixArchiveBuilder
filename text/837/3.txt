Caught in the act! FELIX photographers snapped Council Chairman Neil
McCluskey sneaking into a seedy London house of ill-repute-. M r McCluskey
was so embarrassed when his cover was blown that he quickly covered
his head with a brown paper bag. What will naughty Neil get up to next?
Opinionated
The edited highlights of previous
opinion articles by the Mislamic
society.
Let me begin by clarifying that
Prophets who appeared at different
times and places, though not
simultaneously. A l l propogated the
same faith, but not in the same way
and by using different means. These
alien elements were eliminated by
God and Mislam in its pure and
original f o r m . Indeed the
propogations which were thus
propagated have been improperly
presented by the protagonists of
prophecy, (iii) This original message
was corrupted and split into various
meta-religions by people of different
ages; some were 36, whilst others
were almost 37. These people (peace
be u p o n them) i n d u l d g e d i n
interpolations and admixture, (iv)
Porridge (i) The life of Motorhead
and the manor i n w h i c h he
conducted himself w a s also
recorded in a unique manor by his
companions (peace be upon them)
and by later compilers of the
Tradition. A more complete and
authentic account of life has never
Kazoo
Drinking
songs
Imperial College Kazoo Orchestra
will be holding a recital of German
Drinking songs on December 25.
Included in the repetoire will be 'get
vour kit off darling', and the highly
acclaimed 'Give us another pint or
I'll kick vour teeth in farty breath.'
Both pieces were composed by the
emminent kazoo Virtuoso Karl von
Tippex. Also featured will be the
Hungarian Folk Music ensemble
who will be playing a selection of
M o t o r h e a d classics especially
arranged for the kazoo by Phil
Spector. Tickets for the event cost
12 rupees each and can be obtained
from Bartholemew Hepton-Widdly
Man Con 3.
Cough mixture
Tasting
Our evening of cough mixture
tasting certainly proved popular
with over 20 people attending -
intact it was a real wheeze. As you
been compiled.
How is this knowlege conveyed?
Not through the operations of some
p u b l i s h i n g house. A t the
preliminary stage we gain knowlege
through empirical observation of
Walt Disney cartoons. M i c k e y
Mouse (peace be upon him) has
been seen by many people to be a
prophet, but does not actually
appear in the holv book of Zod. This
does not make him any less a
prophet than Dylan James (cow
dung be upon him).
(ix) H e is man's single diety. To
associate anyone in His worship is
as greater sin as it is an act of
infidelity. Not to ask of him is
sensless arrogance. To seek of him,
and also of others is to associate
equals with him.
So in conclusion there can be no
greater instrument of m o r a l
reformation nor anv better method
to help man develop a sound and
stable character than anything other
than this pile of platypus droppings
(peace be upon them).
PS. If you don't print this article
in full we will execute you and
burn down the FELIX office.
mav be aware, we have a number
of cough mixtures on special offer
this week. Top of the list are
Nightnurse cold remedy, Benelin (a
fine bouquet and good up front),
and Veno's cough linctus which
drinks well into the bottle.
Don't forget our speaker meeting
on January 12th when Mucoid
Sneezalot will be talking o n
remedies for smokers cough.
Weasel
Basil killed
by m.m.m
Last week's weasel race was a great
success. Thanks to the 10
contestants w h o entered their
weasels for this event. The clear
winner was Jingle Bells, owned and
trained bv Dave Smedlev, closley
followed bv Fiona Nicholas owned
and trained by Nigel Baker.
Commiserations are in order for
Basil the three legged weasel who
was cheered on bv the crowd as he
staggered over the line only to be
run over bv Clementine, the Mines
Motororised Mascot.
Our next event will be a weasel
pub crawl on January 5th. Meet at
the Ferret and Firkin at 8pm.
Meanwhile good news for our
lobby of Parliament which is due to
take place next term; M a r y
Whitehouse has agreed to present
a talk on the morality of abortion on
d e m a n d for weasels. H a p p y
weaseling.
Ind Soc
Pot Noodle
freebie
Well kiddies, naughty FELIX has
been up to no good again. As we all
know, the club did not take its
executive officers out to the Savoy
for a £25 per head slap up meal.
I loweyer, in recognition for the
hard work put in to the Careers Fair,
over 100,000 man hours, we took
out four students chosen at random
down to Sainsbury's for a pot
noodle. Which reminds me, our
next visit will be a trip to a baked
bean canning factory where we
should have f u n observing the
oppressed working class sticking
labels onto tin cans. Book earlv as
places are limited. Finally I would
like to thank Nigel for turning a
blind eye, United Sprockets for
giving us a back hander a n d
Mirgaret Thatcher who is more of
a man than Neil Kinnock will ever
be.
Bigots Soc
Intolerance
This is a new body set up by popular
demand from Islamic Soc, ConSoc,
Student Socialist Worker Soc,
RSMU, Third World First and pretty
well everyone else too immature to
recognise that some other people
may hold different opinions from
them. Our aims will be to publish
regularly in FELIX biased and one
sided articles insulting to the
intelligence of the average student
(This has been done before but with
no underlying co-ordination). W e
will also instigate long and purile
arguments in the FELIX letters
column via missives of unparalleled
narrow-mindedness and boredom.
Membership is open to anyone
who still has the mentality of a
playground bully and with our
exciting program of book-burning,
Gay/jew/Leftv/Black bashing (delete
as appropriate) and heckling of
speakers at debates we will have no
shortage of members, especially at
such a bastion of arrogant self-
importance as IC!
