Boring
IC Wins Americas cup
Imperial College boat club stormed
to victory i n the final leg of the
Americas cup series.
The victory w a s totally
unexpected by most sailing experts,
who predicted that the multi million
dollar American yacht, which had
seven hulls and a crew of ninety-
three people, would w i n easily.
However, nobody had allowed for
the I.C. team's secret weapon. The
I.C. crew contained all three
sabbaticals from the Union office,
and at the start of the race they all
stood at the back of the boat and
started m a k i n g speeches
simultaneously. The huge quantities
of hot air thus produced propelled
the I.C. boat to an easy victory,
being timed at a maximum speed of
three hundred and twenty seven
m.p.h.
Union President Nigel Baker later
was asked to comment on having
missed breaking the water speed
record by only 4.7 m.p.h. a n d
.replied that he and his colleagues
were not in good form on the day,
and should be able to produce far
more meaningless waffle during a
future attempt,
scheduled for the
which is
Summer.

Smith wins pools Opportunity
Knocks
College Secretary, John Smith, has
announced his intention to retire
after winning 3.5 Million pounds on
the Football Pools.
Mr. Smith, 22, told FELIX: 'Its
amazing: all I did was put d o w n
eight crosses at random, exactly like
marking an exam paper. I ' m
overjoyed'
Sources in Sherfield say that M r .
Smith went to see the Rector, Eric
Ash, immediately after learning of
his w i n . Professor A s h has refused
to tell FELIX what had happened
during the meeting but it is reported
that the words ' F * * * O * * Eric, I can
afford to leave n o w ' were heard by
the entire fifth floor.
Person or persons unknown
gained entry to the FELIX office
in the middle of the night this
Thursday to produce a spoof
edition of FELIX, called fido.
A source interviewed in the
FELIX office said ' A jokes a joke,
but to print something this boring
goes beyond the bounds of satire.
Mr. Smith says that he will be
spending the money on buying the
government of a small Caribbean
Island.
Fido includes three pages of
information copied from
government leaflets about Poll
Tax, a two page expose of future
plans for the Bookshop (yawn),
and a one page extract from a
cookery book. Spare space has
also been filled with large
numbers of adverts.

Friday.
The crowds were stunned into
silence as the Prof and his talented
birds stole the show and defying all
predictions gained the evening's
highest clapometer reading.
The Rector will be making a
second appearance o n the show
next week when he will thrill the
nation with his African Tree-frog
impressions.
The College switchboard was
jammed with desperate A & R reps
from CBS and E M I anxious to sign
up a major new talent after last
week's show.
Bob Monkhouse told FELIX that
he was 'very very very happy' for
the Rector.
'He's a lovely, lovely man' he
added ' and he deserves every
success in life'
The Rector refused to confirm or
deny rumours yesterday when
FELIX managed to get through the
jammed switchboard to speak to
him, that he was considering
quitting academia f o r
show-buisiness.
In Brief
Top academics at Imperial have
recently discovered a new group of
particles, the existence of which has
previously only been inferred.
Extensive study of College lecture
theatres and tutorials has proven
beyond doubt that both lecturers
and problem sheets emit large
numbers of particles called
'confusons.'
These particles, which have a spin
of mu minus transmit intense waves
of confusion to any student struck
by them. It is surprising that these
particles have not been discovered
before as they are too be found in
great abundance at IC.
Another particle i n the same
family is the Borion, a particle which
transmits boredom. If large numbers
of Borions a n d confusons are
confined, for example in a lecture
theatre, they interact to produce an
extremely powerful depressive field.
This has the effect of warping the
time-subjectivity continuum, thus
allowing a one hour lecture to last
for much longer.
Researchers have deduced that
the maximum possible depressive
field intensity, k n o w n as the
Schwartzchild intensity would be
capable of making a one hour
lecture last 37 hours.
Strenuous attempts have been made
to reach this barrier, particularly in
Mechanical Engineering lectures,
but due to the log inverse square
relationship between depressive
field strength a n d particle
concentration, the m a x i m u m
subjective time dilation coefficient so
far reached is 36.9993, achieved in
.i lubrication lecture.
The discovery of the two particles
has led to the postulation of two anti
particles of opposite spin, the
interestion and the understandon.
Unfortuanately, i n common with
many other particle- anti particle
systems, the anti particles are
incredibly rare.
Late News
We have just heard that due to a
computer error, M r . John Smith,
was overpaid for his pools w i n . A
spokesman for Littlewood's Pools
told FELIX: ' M r . Smith's original
cheque has been invalidated and his
new cheque for Â£3.50 is to be posted
on as soon as possible.'
Sources in Sherfield says that M r .
Smith is now taking steps to placate
the Rector and to get his job back.
He was last seen entering the
Rector's Office carrying a can of boot
polish and some hand cream.
