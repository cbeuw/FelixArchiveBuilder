FELIX
THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Exinations canceled
This years examinations have
been cancelled after the discovery of
printing errors in examination
papers last week. The College say
that it is now too late and too costly
to peprint the papers, but academics
hope to be able to make a fair
assessment of students'
performances from course work.
I he printing m i x - u p was
discovered on Tuesday when
Mechanical Engineering students
complained that they were unable
to answer anv of the questions on
their Stress Analysis paper. Later in
the day, Physics students sitting
their second vear Q u a n t u m
Mechanics exam claimed that the
paper was unaturallv easy.
Investigations by external
examiners revealed that, owing to
errors made at the printing
company, students had been
mistakenly handed the plans for a
lapanese lawn mower.
Professor Eric Laithwaite of
Electrical Engineering admitted that
he was 'baffled' when students
asked h i m whether part MZ37
should slot into part CR251 or screw
into PQRI.
\ltbough examination papers
throughout College have been
withdrawn, academics have denied
allegations that other departments
have been affected.
But a source in Budget Printing
Limited has admitted that the
Bioiogv examination had been
mistakenly replaced by extracts from
First Among Sequels , the latest
book by Jefferv Archer.
. Invigilators first noticed
something was wrong when half of
the students fell asleep during the
exam although FELIX Deputy
I ditor, Chas Brereton later told
reporters that he f o u n d the
examination 'quite interesting.'
The source also admitted that the
company had accidentlv printed
third vear mathematics papers
which made sense.
A spokesman from the
Computing Department denied that
there had been anv mistakes with
their exams and claimed that 'the
liveware had interacted logically
with the paperware with no obvious
signs ot svstem breakdown.'
The Rector, Professor Eric A s h ,
was reported to be looking for
someone to blame.
The Union Staff became overnight T V personalities when they appeared on University Challenge, facing
Aberystwyth Polytechnic's Needlework Department. In a close and hard-fought contest IC scored 130 points
to Bangor's 135 to reach overall last place, setting a new record of the overall lowest score ever achieved i n
University challenge. Ian Morris was said to be 'displeased' with the result. His body was later discovered
by Police, after he had shot all the other teams, several police officers, Bamber Gascoigne and finally himself.
Nigel Baker said, 'We are sorry to see Wendy go but this may improve our chances for next year.'
Four Chinese
students in
hospital
Concern is mounting over the
health of six members of the
Chinese Society at the end of their
one week 'eat i n ' in the Union
Snack Bar.
Four of the students were taken
into intensive care on Friday after
suffering chronic malnutrition and
food poisoning during their week
Jong gesture of solidarity with
students o n hunger strike i n
Peeking.
FELIX Deputy Editor C h a s
Brereton said that he was 'very
concerned' by the incident and said
that the Union would take every
step possible to assist Chinese
Society in their fight against political
opression in China.
I le added ' N o one can accuse us
of being an uncaring Union. 1 will
be delivering pot noodles to the
students in hospital and shaking
their hands personally. O f f the
record, it will be a great photo
opportunity.'
Two of the students, Li Wong and
I len Fong were well enough to
speak to FELIX yesterday.
'We lived on a diet of lentils and
bread pudding for six days because
we angry at the intransigence of the
Chinese Government.' said M r
Wong.
But whilst the 'eat in' has been
seen as a great political gesture by
the student body, it has renewed
fears within the Union Office that
portion sizes in the Union Snack bar
max still be too large.
Speaking by live satellite from his
â€¢ acht in the Bahamas yesterday,
cnion Finance Officer, Reginald
Bohemia, said that portion sizes
were costed on the basis that
students eating there full time
would be seriously emaciated within
three da\ -.
"The Chinese student's protest
has revealed serious deficiencies in
our portion control management.
We have been practically giving
food awa'v' he said
