•4 went to Eynsford filled with joy and
glee
One had some Meridew, then there
were 3
3 went to Eynsford past mud and
horsehit too,
One kept falling over, then there were 2
2 went to Eynsford in the baking sun
One lost all his Persils, then there were
one
One went to Eynsford and over lakes
did leap
But he made the mistakeof not taking a
break
And ended up asleep
No one went to Eynsford, but do not
shed a tear
For it's a bloody certainty
That they'll be back next year.
