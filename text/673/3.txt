UGM Sketch
It is with much regret that the
U G M Sketch this week will not
break with tradition. In the past
half a page has been written
about a three minute meeting
whilst the last meeting was
excessively long only for the
sketch to be butchered down to a
few column inches. This was
rather unfortunate as a veritable
abundance of typically caustic
Mews
wit was lost, most of it being
disparaging remarks about the
F E L I X Editor-elect D a v i d
Rowe. This "Guinness-swilling
penniless nomad" was one of the
few people to attend yesterday's
short meeting (someone called
quorum right at the start) and he
actually made a disparaging
remark himself: during informal
discussions about the formation
of a lunatic fringe at College
Rowe pointed out that such a
body already exists (not Consoc,
STOIC, WIST or Ladies Rugby)
but the Executive (ie the
sabbaticals and C C U Presidents).
Those Exec members on show
yesterday failed to provide
conclusive evidence for , M r
Rowe's hypothesis—one is
patently bald anyway and there's
nothing wrong with Gaynor's
fringe a pair of scissors couldn't
cure although Sean Davies recent
coiffure has been seen as lunatic
in some circles. Perhaps no-
nonsense D P Christine Teller
could have sorted it all out but
she was at the dentists prompting
comments about "the horse's
mouth" from one cruel observer.

Guardian
Praises IC
Imperial College's reply to the
recent University Grants Com-
mittee (UGC) questionnaire has
been greeted with a chorus of
support from other institutions,
according to the Guardian's
Education Correspondent John
Fairhall, in an article in the paper
on Tuesday.
M r Fairhall points out that IC
has that combination of high
academic standards and indus-
trial relevance that is one of the
main aims of the 'Sir Keith
Joseph selective approach'. He
goes on to quote from IC's reply
to the U G C :
"To expect academic staff to
work in deteriorating buildings
with obsolescent equipment, to
teach classes which they know are
too large, and to spend more of
their time chasing grants and
contracts and doing work that
should have been done by non-
existant secretaries or technicians
is to use inefficiently the most
expensive resource higher
education."
The message coming from IC
and from other institutions is that
the Government's higher educa-
tion policy is too crude in its
definition and application. There
is also a call for better science and
maths facilities in schools in
order to attract more good
students to take these subjects,
resulting in more highly qualified
applicants to places like IC. This
comes in the face of the present
Government's policy for the
funding of education which
seems certain to continue to
erode the service at all levels.
Castaways Washed up
in Piccadilly toilet
The IC Union Office was broken
into early on Friday morning last
week and the trophy cabinet was
broken into. Only one trophy, the
'Castaways Cup', was stolen and
this was later recovered by Vine
Street police after being found in
the public lavatories at Piccadilly
Circus.
The thieves are thought to have
made their entry through the
Senior Common Room and the
Hon See's Office. They then
smashed the glass-fronted trophy
cabinet, activating the burglar
alarm.
Security staff in Beit Quad
mistook this for the ladies' toilet
rape alarm, although the control
board has two lights to indicate
which of the alarms has been
activated. Security immediately
visited the toilets but on finding
nothing amiss left without check-
i n g the U n i o n O f f i c e .
Consequently, the thieves were
not challenged and made a free
get-away.
Officers from the local con-
stabulary investigated the theft
on Friday afternoon, assisted by
IC security. The news of the
trophy's recovery came early in
the same evening from the
University of London Union. It
was handed in by a member of the
public to the police who returned
it to U L U since it is a University
trophy. The trophy stolen was
one of the least valuable and a
number of solid silver cups were
left behind. The 'Castaways Cup'
is an inter-college trophy, held at
present by IC Sailing Club.
The present alarm system in
the Union Building was installed
after £5,000 worth of trophies
were stolen in August 1980.
These trophies were never re-
covered, and the present display
consists of replicas. There are
now plans to replace the present
trophy cabinet alarm system with
one independent of the rape
alarm.
OBITUARY
Mark Simms, who graduated from the Electrical Engineering
department last year, was killed in a road accident on 27 March.
Mark was a very active student who was popular with both
fellow students and lecturers. He was STOIC Treasurer for
two years and was awarded social colours for his services to
that society. He left College to work as an engineer for the BBC
at Television Centre and such was his interest in television that
he and three colleagues formed their own video production
company while still at College.
He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and
colleagues.

The Bad
News
Students living in London oyer
the Christmas and Easter
vacations could be seriously out
of pocket if new D H S S proposals
to stop them claiming benefit
over the vacation are approved ,
by the Government. The
proposals are confidenial at
present, but were published in the
Guardian on Wednesday.
At present if you are paying
rent whilst staying in your flat or
room during the short vacations
you can claim the whole of your
rent back in housing benefit.
During term time you can only
claim if your rent (not including
rates, electricity, etc) is over
£19.45 per week, and some
students are able to claim a few
pounds. The new proposals will
allow claims if the residual rent is
above £15.35 per week, but this
figure will apply during the short
vacations as well. In addition it is
proposed that rates will be taken
into account in a different way
resulting in a reduction in the
amount paid in benefit.
The result will be that those
students who can presently claim
during term time will continue to
be paid this benefit through the
vacations, but will not be eligible
to claim more during vacations.
Others unable to claim in term
time will not be able to claim
back their vacation rents. These
changes will cost some students
well over £100 per year in lost
benefits.
Union Welfare Advisor Karen
Stott expressed concern about
the new proposals. She said the
G o v e r n m e n t was a l r e a d y
planning big cuts in housing
benefit in November and these
new proposals were in addition to
those. She will be monitoring the
situation carefully over the
coming months to assess how
any changes will affect IC
students.
These proposals follow the
Government's recent announce-
ment that the system of claiming
travelling expenses will be
changed next year. A flat rate of
£100 per student (£160 for those
living at home) is to be added to
the grant, and no additional
claim will be possible unless you
spend more than £250 on travel.
These new arrangements do not
apply to those living in Scotland,
who can claim as at present. (See
article on page 11.)
