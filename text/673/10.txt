Anti-Apartheid: Right or Wrong?
Last term a questionnaire was
distributed by the Anti-Apartheid
Society on behalf of Imperial
College Union in order to gauge
student awareness of the effects of
apartheid.
Criticisms were made of the
questionnaire as being biased
towards specific standpoints. In
setting out the questionnaire in
this way—a statement, followed
by a question or questions
requiring a yes or no answer—we
were trying to be as informative
about the situation as we under-
stand it to be, and to provide
'food for thought'. Obviously,
the condensation to a sentence of
such wide issues gave a stark and
challenging aspect to the sen-
tence. The yes/no format of the
answer also left no room for 'ifs'
and 'buts' or the statement of any
reservations one might have in
having to give 'black' or 'white'
(!) answers. This was seen how-
ever as a means of making the
questionnaire acceptable to those
who had little time or energy to
produce longer answers. A
'comment' space was left at the
end so that anyone who felt they
would like to qualify an answer,
make a point or give a point of
view could do so. In this way we
could gauge the depth of interest
or involvement felt by those
completing the questionnaire.
We distributed about 500
questionnaires. Of these, 112
were answered, of this number,
60 people made some interesting,
t h o u g h t f u l a n d r e l e v a n t
points—not all in total support of
our case, but many showed an
understanding of the issues
involved and were helpful and
constructive in their comments.
Only two were abusive.
We feel that, if by means of this
questionnaire, we have efigaged
the attention of a reasonable
number of students, provoked
some into deeper thought about
the situation and informed a few
of some facts hitherto unknown
to them, the questionnaire will
have done its job.
A record has been kept of the
answers and the comments
retained as a basis for further
d i s c u s s i o n at subsequent
meetings of the Anti-Apartheid
Society. We would welcome to
our meetings anyone who would
like to put their point of view on
the situation in South Africa, its
record on human rights, and the
fact that apartheid, unlike the
repressive practices which occur
in other countries, is actually
written into the Constitution of
South Africa. There these issues
can be discussed in a reasoned
and thoughtful manner, from
whatever standpoint you choose.
We cannot, as some of the
comments pointed out, change
anything at these meetings but we
can listen to many points of view,
learn from speakers with first-
hand knowledge of the situation,
and being better informed, some
of us may one day be in the
position to make changes for the
better by exerting moral and
political pressure, to prevent the
violation of human rights.
We realise that there are many
countries in the world where
there is repression and torture
and human rights are abused, but
we, in this society are concerned
with what we perceive as the
specific evil of a particular abuse
of human rights embodied in the
Constitution of a country—
apartheid as practiced in South
Africa and Namibia.

Parliamentary
Lobby
Imperial College students will be
participating in a mass lobby of
Parliament next Wednesday to
protest about Government plans
to introduce a new system of
meeting student travel costs.
About 125,000 students will face
a loss of income as a result of
replacement of the current
method of repaying the full costs
by a new flat rate system,
although others will receive an
unexpected windfall.
The new arrangements arc
somewhat complex. In future
students who live away from
home will be paid an element of
£ 100 in their grant to cover travel
Students who stay with fheir
parents will be paid £160. Thos,:
currently studying on courses will
also be able to claim any travel
expenses in excess of £250.
However, those who live
Scotland will be entitled to full
reimbursement of their travel
costs as previously.
Ironically, the review of the
student travel awards system was
originally intended to simplify
administration.
Imperial College students arc
strongly urged to attend the
Parliamentary L o b b y . The
Union's delegation will be
meeting in the Union Office at
2:15pm, and those wishing to
participate should contact the
Union Office for more details.
Remember—it's your grant!
Students may stand to suffer
further hardship as a result of
D H S S plans to review the
payment of Supplementary
Benefit to young people, and the
Government has also launched
an attack on the Further
Education sector in its 'Training
for Jobs' White Paper. Looking
on the bright side, it has been
announced that direct election-;
for the I L E A will go ahead after
all, although I L E A still face
severe cuts and administrative
chaos as a result of local
government legislation.
