Have you ever longed for a sea
water enema at 40mph+? This, I
am reliably informed, is just one
of the possible delights of water-
skiing. The sport was invented
around 1910, and reached IC at
the start of this year, when IC
Waterski Club was added to the
200 or so waterskiing clubs in
Britain. It is one of the fastest
growing sports in the country.
Competitive skiing is in 3 types:
slalom, jumps and tricks.
I C W S C is pitched, so far, at a
more modest level.
The Club ski at the West
India Docks on the Isle of Dogs
every Wednesday afternoon. A
boat and changing facilities, are

hired from the Albatross Club.
The boat is 240 horsepower
'Correct Craft' which is of
tournament standard. A wide
range of skis is available for
experienced skiers. However,
the club is anxious to attract
beginners as well. With sound
instruction on hand most people
are quite proficient after the first
few tours.
When I went to ski for the first
time, the first thing I was shown
was how to get up from the water
to a standing position as the boat
pulls away. I was then taught how
to do this while moving on the
water on the 'edge-bar', a simple
but very effective training device.

Invariably the
skis came off
the boat to which the beginner
holds on to for dear life. This
allows instructions to be given
from the boat until the all
important techniques of getting
up on the water has been
mastered. This can be done in
one afternoon. I found I fell over a
lot, and invariably the skis came
off. This wastes some time while
you get in the boat to put them
on. The better you get, the less
time (and money) you waste.

Given eight quid, a towel and a spark of enthusiasm,
you too can walk on water! Or in fact, better still,

location is not ideal in this
respect. The Club are cor:
sidering skiing at weekends,
probably on a different stretch of
water.
The other main problem is the
cold. Wet suits can be hired from
the Albatross Club at £1 per
hour, but even so, it can be
'bloody cold' on the waterside
once the suit is wet. However,
hot drinks are available after
skiing, and there are hot showers
in the changing rooms. In any

case, the worst weather is now
past. I first saw them skiing in
February! Warmer weather and
lower winds make skiing much
more enjoyable. A l l of the
experienced skiers I've spoken
to have skied in various exotic
middle-eastern countries, and
much swapping of stories goes
on between them.
So what do you need to join?
Well, you don't need a wet suit or
skis, which can be hired. You do

The charge to IC students is
£2.90 for ten minutes skiing,
which is about 60% less than the
going rate elsewhere. This may
sound expensive but ten minutes
in the water actually amounts ,to
an entire afternoon of water-
skiing. At my stage ten minutes is

quite enough since it is very tiring
on the arms (or maybe I'm just
feeble). Apart from skiing, club
members can spend some time
as observers in the boat (this
entails keeping the driver in-
formed of what the skier wants
him to do) and it is possible that
some might be trained to drive
the boat. This will be more
probable when the Club has its
own boat, which is a plan in the
pipeline as long as the money can
be found.
