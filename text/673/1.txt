NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
MOONEY
MONOPOLY
SMASHED!
The College has given the go ahead for IC Union to run the refectory in
the Union Building next session. The final decision was made at a meeting
of the Rector's Policy Committee on Tuesday. The Union takeover
represents a radical departure from previous College policy of
maintaining a centrally-managed catering service throughout College,
the so-called 'Mooney Monopoly'.
The Union's aim in running the
refectory would be to provide a
snack bar outlet with simple hot
and cold food during the lunch
period and snacks during mid-
morning and afternoon sessions.
Extensive use will be made of
microwave cookers for serving
hot snacks. Other lines will be
prepared on-site, eg sandwiches,
rolls, ploughman's lunches, etc.
The details of the takeover
have still to be worked out
between College and the Union.
Under the Union's proposals the
refectory will be run by a
full time refectory manager and
an assistant who will be
employed during term time only.
Additional staff will be employed
on a casual basis. The Union will
oversee the management through
a Catering Committee consisting
of Union officers and the
r e f e c t o r y m a n a g e r . T h i s
committee will be responsible for
overall policy and long term
planning for the outlet, rather
than day to day running which
will be the responsibility of the
manager.
The Union Building refectory
has been declining in popularity
for several years, despite being
moved from the present Ents
Mr Mooney at work
'Lounge Lizards' room to the
lounge bar two years ago. The
move involved considerable
investment by College in
constructing a completely new
outlet in an effort to revitalise the
refectory. However, despite the
refectory's facelift the food
served remained almost identical
to that sold in the old outlet and
the decline continued. During the
present academic year the
refectory has made a substantial
loss and it had been accepted by
the College that major changes
were necessary and consideration
had been given to closing the
refectory completely.

Rent Increase To
Match Grant
The College have agreed to keep rent increases down to approximately
4% for College-owned premises. This figure, which is in line with the
student grant increase, will mean 50p to £1 extra per week for students in
Halls and Evelyn Gardens. Rents for Head Tenancies are likely to go up
more, since increases of up to 10% have been imposed by the landlords.
The College has agreed, however, to absorb some of this amount,
hopefully leading to an increase to the student of less than 10%.
The bill for messengers and
security in Halls is to go to the
residence account from now on.
The annual cost at present is
some £97,000, but Student
Residence Committee (SRC)
have outlined a reduction in
service which would lead to an
annual bill of £42,000. The
Rector has agreed that the
£55,000 difference will be met out
of the College account, until the
reductions in service can be
achieved by natural wastage.
The Rector has also indicated
that the two flats in Linstead Hall
at present occupied by academics
will be put at the disposal of the
SRC as soon as possible. This will
release a number of places for
student use, p r o b a b l y as
accommodation for married
students. The Penthouse flats in
Southside on the other hand,
seem certain to return to use by
academics.
The College is at present
looking for a new residence for
between 100 and 200 students.
This will replace the Fremantle
Hotel, the lease for which expires
in 1985. In view of the problems
experienced with the Fremantle it
seems unlikely that the lease
w o u l d be r e n e w e d . T h e
properties viewed so far are too
expensive to be self-financing if
rents are to be kept at a
reasonable level. It is hoped that
income derived from the Summer
Accommodation Scheme could
be used to supplement funds for
such a purchase. Last year the
scheme raised a record of £98,000
compared with less than half that
figure in previous years. (For the
bad news see page 3).
The Union's receptionist Jo
Hewanicka left on 4 April to take
up a job in graphic design. She
has been employed by the Union
for nearly three years, before
which she worked in the College
Conference Office.
During her time in the Union
Office Jo's friendly and helpful
manner has been appreciated by
all those making enquiries in the
office.
It is not expected that a new
receptionist will be appointed
until September. In the meantime
Union officers and staff will be
covering her duties. It would
greatly assist them if all members
of clubs and societies would
check the Message Book in the
Union Office for their messages.
