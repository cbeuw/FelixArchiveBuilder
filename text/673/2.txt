Outrage
Dear Editor
As current A l t e r n a t i v e
Prospectus Editor, I must voice
my feelings of anger and disgust
towards IC Exec for overruling
Council's decision to provide a
pewter tankard for the post of
A P Editor.
Apparently the Exec consider
such a provision 'unimportant'.
Adding insult to injury,
Christine Teller has gone on to
say that there is no reason why
Publications Board cannot
purchase their own tankard
outside. (This would cost £25
more than one from the Union.)
Apparently, the Exec are more
interested in conserving their
slowly dwindling stock of
blank tankards than seeing any
of them put to good use.
Let us remember what the A P
is for: it is a publication which
attempts to show students'
feelings about their courses and
IC itself to prospective
students. If the A P was 100%
successful, no one would come
here without knowing what
they were letting themselves in
for.
In the past, the A P was
produced by the Academic
Affairs Officer. The Editor's
post was created to put
production and presentation
into the hands of a publications
specialist (and to take a large
burden from the shoulders of
the A A O ) .
Now let us consider tankards:
frivolous and unnecessary they
certainly are, but they remain a
vital part of IC tradition. In
their refusal to grant one to A P
Editors past, present and
future, Exec have insulted and
belittled David Rowe and Hugh
Southey and the hard work they
have put into the AP. They have
also forced the resignation of
David Rowe, a most able Pub
Board Chairman who has
always been ready to help with
a d v i c e a b o u t p r i n t i n g ,
publishing and advertising for
publications editors.
As to my own course of
action, my resignation from the
post of A P Editor would be
entirely justified: I do not do so
only because this would be
detrimental to next year's A P .

Dear Pallab
To many the decision of
Dave Rowe to resign over a
matter as apparently trivial as a
p o t i o r A P must have seemed
petty. After all pots, like many
of IC's traditions, are merely
anachronisms. Reminders of
the days when women weren't
allowed in the Union Bar and
the Union Building was only on
two levels. However to take this
view ignores the significance of
these pots.
Pots are t r a d i t i o n a l l y
purchased by the Union for
certain Union posts. These
posts have to be well
established. Other than this
there appear to be few criteria
for the decision. There have
now been three A P Editors, all
of whom have done the job to
the best of their ability. They
have each produced eighty page
booklets that have been among
the best of their kind in the
country. A l l three have had to
work extremely hard (often into
the early hours of the morning)
and have needed a high level of
c o m m i t m e n t . W h e n one
compares the performance of
the A P Editors with that of
some of the more anonymous
Union officers, who seem to
have been awarded pots
because of their capacity for
sherry, the only possible
conclusion is that the Exec's
decision was wrong, and a
calculated insult to the A P J
Editors. Possibly the real'
reason was the unpopularity of!
F E L I X with the Union Office.
To the majority of Union I
members, the fact that the Exec |
overturned a Council decision |
should be more worrying. The :
pot was approved unanimously
by Council, a committee that is
made up of over forty people
representing all the Union's
activities* It is a far more
representative committee than,
the Executive. The Executive I
should only make decisions
concerning day to day decisions
as it is made up of only six
people. Six people who can:
h a r d l y be s a i d to bei
representative. Hopefully next
Monday Council will overturn I
H H B H i Friday. May
the Executive's decision and
show that its decisions should
only be reversed by U G M s (the
most democratic forum of all).
If you still think the A P
Editor's pot is a storm in a
teacup, then I apologise for
wasting your time. However,
hopefully this letter will have
explained the amazement of
Dave Rowe, Diane Love and
myself about the decision.

Dear Pallab
I am shocked that the Exec
should refuse Pub Board a pot
from the Union stock for use by
the A P Editor. They have inter-
fered beyond the remit given to
them by the Constitution and
have no right to overturn
decisions by Pub Board and
Council. I would hope the latter,
body would express their dis-
satisfaction at their action in the
strongest possible way.
I hope that the Exec have
good reason to take the action
they did. It would be sad if such
a fine Exec has descended so far
as to act out of petty
vindictiveness. Such meaness of
spirit is very sad indeed.
I remain
Yours sincerely

Riot
Dear Sir
Last Wednesday (21 March)
we held a party at R C M at
which several IC students were
present—and to which they are
normally welcome—however,
amongst those IC students
present, 3 males have caused us
much concern.
They did not wish to pay the
modest entrance charge of £1,
but were persuaded to do so.
Before they left, they blocked
the sinks in the 3rd floor
lavatories and left the taps
running. This caused extensive
flooding and put one of our lifts
out of action. They also pulled I
towel holders and tiles off the
wall, pulled half a dozen lockers
off the wall, molested a female
student and departed with afire
extinguisher.
At the time of this party, our
Bursar was celebrating his'
retirement with colleagues and j
the Council. The ensueing
mopping-up operation almost
ruined his party and left me
considerably embarrassed.
In future, all n o n - R C M
students will be required to
produce identification and sign
in at our parties which I think is
unfriendly and tedious, but in
the light of what went on at our
last party, I think such
m e a s u r e s are p e r f e c t l y
reasonable.
Yours faithfully

Nasties
Sir
Once again the NUS debate is
re-hashed in F E L I X . The
report of Imperial's two
observers to the N U S Easter
C o n f e r e n c e is f a c t u a l l y
inaccurate and glossed over the
undemocratic and unrepresen-
tative nature of NUS. Free
speech, for example, was not
possible if you were a member
of the F e d e r a t i o n o f
Conservative Students (FCS)
while the hard left of the
Labour Students had ample
freedom to promote their
r e v o l u t i o n a r y a c t i v i t i e s .
Physical assault and verbal
absue was rampant and the
present Vice Chairman of F C S
was kicked in the head after a
speech. Where delegates were
the only Tory from their
university there were many
cases of intimidation by the
other (left-wing) members of
their delegation, and one who
refused to vote for a Labour
candidate had her voting card
ripped from her hand when she
tried to vote. Many Conserva-
tives were labelled as racist and
fascist and the police had to be
called several times to restore
order.
Rather than promoting such
a reprehensible organisation as
NUS should not Imperial be
helping other colleges in
London to dissafiliate as we
have?
