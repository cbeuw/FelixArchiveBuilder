Dramsoc
Dramsoc is going on tour to
Edinburgh again! After the suc-
cesses of last year (packed houses
and excellent reviews) we are
touring again under the name
'Beit Theatre'. There are going to
be three—perhaps four—shows
being performed. They are The
Gambler based on the novel of
the same name by Dostoyevsky,
Poe written by Graham Brand
and a specially written children's
show called Piggies in the Middle.
The first two shows will run on
alternate nights from 10 August
to 25 August with the kid's show
running from 27 August to 1
September.
The auditions for all these
shows will be this Sunday 13 May
at 2:00pm (meet in Dramsoc
Store, up past the IC Union
Office). If you cannot make
Sunday they will also be held on
Tuesday 15 May at 7:00pm
(again, meet in the Storeroom).
These auditions are open to
anyone interested. If you are at all
interested in acting, or other
technical matters, then
Edinburgh provides an excellent
opportunity to perform along-
side professional groups—and
often do better than them. The
rehearsals take place in London
after the exams for about six
weeks then everyone moves up to
Edinburgh. We will be living in
Edinburgh University rooms.
You can act in any one or more of
the shows but if you can only
spare a week in Edinburgh then
Piggies in the Middle is the
appropriate show to audition for.
All of the shows are promising.
Two adaptations of books won
Fringe Firsts last year and, after
Cambridge Footlights, children's
shows are the first to sell out.
Also the themes of the play Poe
should prove to be popular with
the Edinburgh audience. If you
have any questions or doubts,
come along on Sunday or Tues-
day and have a chat. You may
well find things more flexible
than you imagined.
On the technical side, there is
still room for people, experienced
or otherwise, for lighting, sound
and stage management. The week
'zero' (4-10 August) is when the
theatre has to be set up since
Dramsoc, under the title 'Theatre
West End', is running the venue
at the end of Princes Street, the
main shopping street. If you are
interested in some of the organi-
sational work involved then
come up on Sunday and we'll tell
you what is involved.
Whether acting or working
behind the scenes, the Edinburgh
Tour is an opportunity not to be
missed for anyone interested in
drama. Seeing shows, acting in
shows and working on shows
before an appreciative audience,
and the press, is definitely '...a
rarity'.
ICSO
The concert on Wednesday 16
May at 8:00pm in the Great Hall
promises to be the most popular,
most erotic musical event of the
year at Imperial. In an attempt to
entice even the least musically
minded, we're playing Finlandia
by Sibelius, Beethoven's 5th
Symphony, Rhapsody in Blue by
Gershwin and lastly, the
undoubted 'climax' of the eve-
ning, Ravel's Bolero (of Bo
Deiek fame). Can Chris
Brannick, Nightline Chairman,
finally prove his claims of being
able to keep it up throughout the
piece? Will (Dickie) Bow Dickens
'interruptus' and make us start
again? A t 80p, there can't be a
cheaper alternative to a Mines
Porn night.
Rag Fete
The Rag Committee desperately need
clubs, societies or group of individuals to
hold stalls at the Rag Fete next Saturday.
Anyone interested should see Sean Davis or
James Benbow
