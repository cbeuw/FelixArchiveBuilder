-Believer
This is a most peculiar piece of
vinyl. Schizophrenic, almost. Even
the cover is split in its theme; a junk
photo montage, in the shape of a
crucifix, on an oil painting sun.
The record continues in its dual
nature; consisting of a rough sixties
'I'm a Believer' section which, to
tell the truth, is a bit crap really and
then it breaks into a T need you
more..." chorus which is
uplifting—stratospheric, almost—
just when you're expecting it to be
just one huge steaming pile of shite,
dragging it back from the edge of
despair, and into the light, a bit
symbolic of the cover really

• Be/iever is out now on
Columbia/Sony. The Real People
play Camden Underworld, 21 May.
There is no denying that Squeeze's
finest moments came from their
early years: 'Cool for Cats', Take
Me I'm Yours', 'Up the Junction',
'Goodbye Girl', and with a couple
of exceptions ('Slap and Tickle',
'Hourglass') that was it. But of
those, only 'Hourglass' didn't
appear on 'Singles 45 and Under'.
So, if you've got that, you don't
really need this. On the other hand,
if" you don't, have it, then it all
comes down to whether you like
Squeeze or not.

All you conscientious students are
probably revising away for exams
over the next week; so this is wasted
on you. For the dedicated popkids
though, it's a different story: A very
busy week ahead, so let's get on
with it. Tonight, The Sultans of
Ping FC at U L U , fresh from last
term's ICU appearance, or for those
of you with sights on a wider
horizon, Airstream at the Old
Trout.
Staying at the Old Trout, on
Saturday we have the Popinjays
appearing in this column for two
weeks running. Next week, we
might even review their single,
at the Marquee two more bands
who have played here in the last
year or so; Rain and The Cuckoos.
Monday, and The Adventures'
second London gig of the month,
and their fourth in four years.
Tuesday, and it's our beloved
Airhead, who've recently been
dropped by the record company, so
we've got a picture to remind you
what they look like. Support from
Bedazzled, who must be much
better (by default).
Wednesday, and Del Amitri in
Kilburn, a welcome return for the
Scottish rockers, and The Tender
Trap who, over the past two weeks
have filled the Felix mailbox with
postcards. Thursday rounds it all up
with the smart money going to see
Kingmaker, Resque and music
press darlings Suede. The scouse
money meanwhile will no doubt be
at the Underworld with The Real
People. Shakespear's Sister hang
out in Westminster, so if you're
really stuck for somewhere to go...
