Sports New IC Hostel
Imperial College Sports centre will
be closed for extensive renovations
for all of the first term next year.
The renovations were due to be
completed over the summer
vacation, but the Sports Centre
Manager, Ray Coleman, said that
the delay was due to 'endless
committees'.
Imperial College Sports Centre
has been a source of controversy
since the beginning of term when
the changes were proposed. Its
management has been criticised by
academic staff and students alike for
being run 'undemocratically' and
for becoming profit orientated
rather than a service to the college.
A letter in the last edition of
Network, an Imperial College
publication, called for a users'
meeting to discuss the changes and
an explanation of the costs of the
proposed renovations.
Mr Coleman said that the Sports
Centre would be closed from
August 9th until 2nd January. He
said that the loss of Sports facilities
to incoming students would be
unfortunate but that arrangements
were being made to find alternative
venues for clubs and students during
the first part of the next academic
year. (iCNN)

The Rector, Sir Eric Ash, yesterday
rejected proposals to introduce two
year degree courses at Imperial
College. Speaking to / C N N , Sir
Eric said that they were not suitable
for institutions producing serious
scientists, though he was 'not
personally opposed' to two year
degrees within the university
system. This opinion is shared by
Professor Stuart, Dean of the Royal
College of Science, who said that
the proposals would be 'suitable for
some courses there is a small
body of students that would
benefit.'
The comment follows the
recommendation to introduce a
semester system at King's College
London (KCL). A working group
of five senior academics at K C L
have proposed that the academic
year be split into three 13 week
teaching terms, followed by two
weeks holiday and a fortnight of
exams. In a two year degree course,
students would take all three terms,
while students on a three year
course would only take two terms
in any one year.
The Rector. Sir Eric Ash, said this
week that the College was
considering the purchase of a
former Ministry of Defence hostel
to provide more student
accommodation. Furse House is
situated on 37-41 Queens' Gate
Terrace and is said to be capable of
housing 200 students. The hostel
has large rooms on the basement,
ground and first floors that could be
used for recreational purposes,
meeting places and teaching rooms.
The Rector said that T would give
my right arm to get it I would
hate to see it go to a lesser academic
establishment.'
The cost of acquiring the property
is described as 'considerable.' The
Rector said that the College could
borrow part of the required sum,
but he did not believe that the
college could increase the deficit on
the student residences account,
currently running at £2 million. The
remainder of the money is to be
raised by what is described as
'alternative means.' The IC
Zoe Hellinger, Imperial College
Union President, announced this
week that the College is considering
a merger with the Charing Cross
Westminster Medical School. The
architect of the proposal has been
named as Professor Peter Richards,
Dean of St Mary's Hospital Medical
School and pro-Rector of Medicine.
The announcement comes after
rumours that the College was to
merge with a postgraduate medical
school, and after reports from
'London Health Emergency' that
Charing Cross Hospital was to be
closed when the government
appointed Tomlinson Inquiry team
reports in the immediate future.
Imperial College merged with St
Mary's Hospital Medical School in
1988.
A merger between IC and a
postgraduate teaching hospital
would fuel speculation that IC
wishes to become a graduate school
in the long term, admitting
postgraduate students only. Ms
Hellinger, in a report to ICU
Council, wrote that she 'will be
discussing the wider effects of this
merger on the students and the
students' union with the intention of
producing a report for Governing
Body.'
Professor Richards said that he
had submitted a paper to the IC
Board of Studies on the possibility
of mergers after the publication of
the Tomlinson report. The paper.
Development Office is to hold a
function in the Rector's residence
on 20 May designed to 'solicit
financial and advisory support from
leading alumni ... about the
possibility of acquiring the
property.' A viewing party will
meet in the Rector's residence for
drinks, and then return for a buffet
reception after viewing.
The comments follow the recent
news that IC Estates may be on the
verge of guaranteeing two year of
college accommodation to all
students. The proposals was floated
at a recent 'Residence' meeting.
The Estates Department believe that
the guarantee could increase the
number of undergraduate student
applications to Imperial. A
complementary approach is
believed to have been prepared to
increase the number of postgraduate
applications. Estates are reported to
be planning the development of
'luxury' postgraduate
accommodation.
which has now gone to the IC
Governing Body, said that Imperial
Medicine was 'small and strong'
and would develop by harnessing
scientific strength. He added that
Charing Cross Westminster had
produced its own position paper in
the last week. A spokesman for
Charing Cross Hospital told / C N N
that things were 'tied up with the
Tomlinson Inquiry.' Charing Cross
Hospital is one the twelve teaching
hospitals being investigated by Sir
Bernard Tomlinson's Inquiry team,
which is looking into levels of
health care provision in London.
Speculation is that the Tomlinson
Inquiry will argue for the closure
of two London hospitals and one
teaching hospital. John Lister, of
pressure group 'London Health
Emergency,' said that they expect
St. Thomas and Charing Cross to
be shut. There is also speculation
that University College Hospital
will close.
An independent inquiry being
carried out by the 'King's Fund
London Initiative' has called for a
'radical change to London's
medical schools.' In a working
paper that expresses serious
concerns about the viability of
teaching hospitals in London,
London's medical schools are
challenged to 'lessen their reliance
on teaching hospitals in order to
broaden and improve education in
the capital.'
RCSU....
continued from front page
from the C C U budget is illegal.
The total claimed cost of these
complementary ball tickets has been
leaked to iCNN. The claimed cost
for the Royal School of Mines C C U
is stated as £450, that for City and
Guilds Union has been stated as
£660, and the RCSU has reportedly
claimed for £ 9 8 0 in lieu of
complementary tickets, though this
figure may have been inflated by
other miscellaneous and unspecified
expenditure. It has been reported to
/ C N N that the RCSU cash crisis
began when the Senior Treasurer
refused to sign cheques until a firm
costing was produced for the RCSU
May Ball. The Ball was initially
advertised as featuring the Capital
Roadshow, though this did not turn
up, reportedly due to extraneous
circumstances.
Headlock
An opportunist thief was caught on
Monday by two members of the
Physics department. Dr Nick
Franks, Reader in the Biophysics
Section, challenged a man found in
the department rummaging through
a jacket. The man said that he was
looking for the career's office, so
Dr Franks decided to escort him
there. At the Blackett Security lodge
the stranger seriously assaulted
Andy Jenkins, one of Dr Frank's
research students who had helped
escort him. He escaped out onto
Prince Consort road followed by the
physicists but was caught by M r
Jenkins, and put in a head lock by
Dr Frank (an ex Old Mill-Hillian
wing-Forward).
When the man asked to be let go,
Dr Franks replied 'I've waited for
years to catch someone like you,
and I'm not going to let you go
now.' A Police patrol van happened
to be passing and the thief was taken
to Rochester Row police station
where he has been charged with
burglary and assault.
Biology
Biology students will be issued with
a questionnaire on the future of
course structures in the department
today (Friday). This follows
concern over leaked proposals to
halve the number of second year
Biology options. Informed sources
indicated to /CNN that the cuts may
be extended to the Biology third
year.
