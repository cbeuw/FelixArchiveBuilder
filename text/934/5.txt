Before the pursuit cop could
make any loud comment Stress shut
the door, pulled a white chair over
and wedged it under the doorknob.
'What do you think you're
doing?'
' O N E . T W O . B R E A K I N G
T H R O U G H ! '
A great dent appeared in the door
under Stress's hands and the floor
shuddered. He backed away and
watched the onslaught on the door,
the chair shaking with fright at the
attack.
' T H R E E , FOUR, SMASH T H E
DOOR!'
Stress turned around and saw a
slim sparkly staff go right through
him.
'Take that, you monster!'
Even through he was being
attacked by a transparent,
immaterial hologram Stress covered
his head with his hands and ran back
down the corridor trying to avoid
perfection in a dress.
'FIVE, SIX, M O R E KICKS!'
Another earsplitting crack and a
neat impression of eight small
wheels and a shoe appeared on the
door. Shards of metal and plastic
exploded from around the door and
peppered Stress as he avoided a
chest stab from an instrument of the
supernatural.
'Get out of here! Your skin
complaints could destroy all of us!'
Stress dropped his head and
charged, carreering straight through
the staff and the shocked woman,
smashing through the window and
down on to the floor of the room.
He staggered up, looked at the
shocked faces and ran out through
a door marked, 'hollowglam data,
the no disease deceased'.
Red light, long rows, more long
rows.
Stress looked around. Standing
into the distance in a massive low
room were shelves of thin
cylinders, glowing slightly in the
strange light. Looking back through

the glass door he saw a massive
figure drop and roll, getting up and
coming his way.
' S E V E N , E I G H T ,
ANNIHILATE!'
Stress dashed to the side as the
door exploded outwards, bounced
off the walls and clattered to the
floor. He crawled, panic stricken
under some shelves and out along
an aisle.
' C O M E O U T , C O M E O U T ,

Stress started running down the
nearest aisle.
full in the face, the explosion
rippling across the metal of his
features on to the speakers. The
robot crashes to the floor not forty
feet from Stress and lies still.
Stress slows his pace and walks
up to the prone form. He stares at
the metal machine for a while and
then leans back agains the shelves,
closing his eyes.
' S C H K S C J S K H G R R S X C X C
Stress jumps and staggers back
looking at the rising form of the
robot. The battered body staggers
to its rollers and stares at Stress.
'KLJHRCHKSLS?!'
The robot stopped its speech and
tries to adjust its speakers,
The Inner System
Magnetic tapes on shelves fly past
Stress. His legs are a blur of
motion, his face is sweating and his
eyes wide. The end of the aisle
approaches. He slows the
movement of his legs and the
shelves in response Cease their tying
past and pause for breath. Stress
staggers around the corner and
faces a blank wall. He looks the
other way and gets the same
message.
Dead end.
As he stands there, taking this in,
the distant sounds of a bugler comes
to his ears. He turns to look back
the way he has come and sees a
faraway figure rapidly approaching.
The sounds of hoofbeats and
warcries shake the tapes around him
as they echo up and down the aisle.
With these sounds in his brain the
military chemical factory inside him
is roused once again. Through
excessive use the constraints on it
have become frayed, the effect no
longer controlled. Stress feels his
heart beat faster, adrenalin rush
blurring his vision. But there is no
drive of will, only fear and
awareness. He finds himself
drawing the truth gun from his
pocket and begins to run straight
towards his enemy. The robot
grows in his vision, speakers
sounding the charge. Rollers grind
the ground, throwing up smoke and
sparks. His adversary unslings his
gun and fires at Stress. Tapes
scatter to Stress's right. Stress lifts
the gun as he runs headlong, the
weapon steady as the body tears
through the air. Another shot rips
up the floor before him, he hurdles
the gap and bears down on his
opponent, aiming for his target.
'TIME T O W A V E B Y E B Y E ,
TIME T O QUICKLY FRY, TIME
T O DIE!'
Stress shoots. The robot is struck
eventually battering them with its
hands to stop the rusty guitar chords
from strumming out. It attempts to
speak again.
' L I K E A R O L L I N G
C H R O M E ! ! '
Grimacing at the gravelling,
cracked words it turned to Stress,
blue sparks crackling off its eyes.
Seeing the look Stress started
stumbling away as the robot drew
itself up ot its full height and
levelled its gun at its prey. It
pressed the trigger. The gun
exploded in a shower of light and
sound. As the smoke cleared Stress
looked at his enemy in a new light.
The robot was now a rainbow
coloured, ragged figure, smoking
slightly in the aftermath of the blast.
The pursuit cop fainted. Stress ran
off down the corridor leaving the
malfunctioning machine behind him
emitting reedy wailing noises.
