AaaareeeeeeNggg!
Tonight is the night; the night the
70s reign supreme. Abba, Boney
M , the Jackson Five, and all as
camp as can be. This is your last
chance to enjoy 'Disco' in the
Original sense of the word, Drag
out your kipper collar, pull on those
flairs, strut your funky stuff with
those thigh-high, kinky boots.
This is it! Relive your youth!
Capture the fever of the era! Get
down and groove!
For your pleasure we have a
catwalk show of 70s fashions
(volunteers and volunteered
needed!) hosted by the delectable
Barbarella, prizes for the best
period-dressed people, bar
extension and music 'til the small
hours. The cost for this spectacular
is a mere £1.50 if you come dressed
appropriately and £3.00 if you insist
on being boring. Cast aside your
inhibitions and bring out your Glad
Rags. All proceeds go to ICU Rag
so come along and get on down.
Doors open 8pm. Be there and be
square, Dude!

Geronimooooh ung... uh... uh...
yes...yes...yes...yes yes yes yes
yes! No not sex. The latest- Rag
exploits! This weekend saw twelve
normal, sane(?) people heading off
up North to the Derby American
Adventure Theme Park. The
reason? To throw themselves off a
150ft crane with nothing to stop
them plummeting to their deaths but
a piece of elastic. Yes this was the
Great Rag Bungee Team. We spent
the morning trying out the death
defying rides on offer at the park
in a vain attempt to convince
ourselves that Newton was wrong.
Then at 1pm G M T we synchronised
our watches and said our goodbyes.
One by one we ascended over 150ft
in a cradle until we found ourselves
suspended over the earth with little
between us and oblivion.Three
short whistle blasts later and the
brave found themselves plummeting
towards the earth approaching
terminal velocity (0 to 60 in about
two seconds) having passed the
point of no return. Boing! And off
we went again. Blood surging to
your head, heart pounding and
adrenalin rushing. If anyone has any
doubts about this being comparable
to sex let me put your minds at rest.
The opening line to this article was
made by one of our team members
during the above mentioned
descent. The jumps were done for
UNICEF and we were honoured to
meet their token celebrity (well
she'd been on Newsround once!).
Sitting under the crane she marked
all leapers on style and scream with
bonus points also available. The
results for our team are recorded
here for posterity. In jumping
order.

Okay all you Mathematicians so we
had 13 jumpers. Sam Cox was so
impressed with our performance
that, despite being scared of
heights, she decided to jump too! A
final mention goes to our four
supporters who came along to cheer
(and to have a great cheap day out!),
a big T H A N K Y O U to anyone and
everyone who sponsored jumpers
and an even bigger T H A N K Y O U
to all the crazy leapers themselves.
If you sponsored someone please
cough up generously a.s.a.p. and
could all leapers present their
sponsor forms along with cheques
for the total amount collected by
24th May. (Cheques to be made
payable to UNICEF and submitted
to the rag office at lunchtime or the
Union Office) Be mad, be silly, be
part of it. Boing!
