Opinion Felix 934 15 May 1992
Imperial College Union Council is
a curious beast. It is supposed to be
a streamlined version of a Union
General Meeting ( U G M ) ,
introduced because the Union
couldn't offer any reasons for
anyone to turn up to UGMs any
more. The general idea is that
students are represented by their
departmental reps., by the societies
that they are members of, and by
the constituent college unions that
they are forced into. That means
that the current council has a total
number of fifty six posts, which are
filled by fifty one people.
Streamlined council? Steaming
quagmire, more like.
Whilst the representation is
wonderful, the only problem is that
deserve. Try counting the number
of sabbaticals that turned up at the
last E G M in the Junior Common
Room on Thursday 7th. Eins, zwei,
drei....
The most widespread impression
of last Monday's council was that
it was so incredibly boring. Well,
not incredibly. Predictably boring.
To avoid debate, searching
questions, and accountability, then
submit your report to council just
30 minutes before it starts. Or be
a sabbatical. Hand it in at five to
six. That way no-one knows what
they are talking about. This is
dangerously suspicious. The third
term is a time when union and
Sherfield watchers are tied up with
exams, and so is an idea time to slip

chance you want to submit a
motion, the deadline is Thursday 21
May at 12.30pm. You have been
warned.
How many elections is that this
year? Numerous E G M elections,
two sets of sabbatical elections, a
general election, local elections,
and rescheduled E G M elections.
All well and good. Democracy (sic)
in action. Now add another. There
will be a Union Annual General
Meeting on 23 June, for the posts
of Haldane Library Book Buyer,
Haldane Library Record Buyer,
Felix Business Manager, and
Ordinary Members of House
Committee. Now who's going to be
here on 23 June? About as many
people as turned up for Council last
Monday.
Next on the agenda was the most
amazing report tabled at Council in
living memory. At best, it was an
encouragement to the sabbaticals to
get more involved with their Union.
At worst, it implied 'resign now'.
J suggest ... that sabbaticals
actually attend MSC meetings ...I
can't recall the last time a sabbatical
came to a meeting ... if sabbaticals

suppressed. It's a bit of a vicious
circle. Of course, it is exam time,
an excuse well monopolised by the
sorry collection of apologies that
thundered their way into the Union
Office last Monday.
The latest gathering of quagmire
was in the Union Dining Hall last
Monday. Not that you knew about
it, of course. The members are so
busy representing you that it
becomes a bit of a bore for them to
tell the ordinary citizens that an
important meeting is taking place.
But if you are not going to turn up
at the U G M s or the E G M s
(Extraordinary General Meetings),
then you have no-one else to blame.
You get the representation you
things past. And as time slipped past
during Council, so did the schemes.
The first dodge was trying to
excuse the last pathetic E G M . That
was a miserable affair. No sound
system, a missing sabbatical, and a
distinct lack of participation.
Thankfully, someone called
quorum, and to the credit of all, this
happened after the important
business of Hon Sec ratification was
done. That only left elections for
House Committee Chairman,
Publicity Officer, Academic Affairs
Officer, Post Graduate Affairs
Officer and Transport Officer
hanging in the air, along with
motions on 'Third World' Debt. So,
question: How do you deal with a
disastrous EGM? Answer: Call
another. And that's just what they
did. The next E G M is Thursday 28
May at 1pm in the JCR. If by
the threat of
imposed reform

meeting
wish to disown or not be involved
in the work of the MSCs then I for
one would be happy to remove them
from our constitution ... I have
spent too much time apologising to
SCC for the ineffectiveness of ICU
... we need to get our acts
together.
Strong. Yet it was passed with not
a murmur. Do they read each
other's reports?
Good news emerged from the
Social Cultural and Amusements
Board report. OpSoc doing Gilbert
and Sullivan for Rag, the Orchestra
performing the 1812 overture for
Alumnus Day, and DramSoc
adding the cannon fire. The work
continues. The choir are to give a
concert on May 29.
In setting a dangerous precedent,
Rag Chairman Penguin presented a
collection of new Rag job
descriptions, which were passed at
an earlier Rag Committee Meeting.
Penguin himself was sadly berated
during the Council meeting, for
trying to hold some nameless
sabbaticals accountable. This came
as a complete shock to their system,
