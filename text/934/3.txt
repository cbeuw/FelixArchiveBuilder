15 May 1992 Felix 934 Editorial
editoria
The increasing regularity of
sneezing and snuffling around the
office ordains the onset of summer.
The grass is procreating, the
pigeons are coo-cooing, the Beit
duck is back in the quad (and living
in a gorse bush). Ah, springtime;
when a young man turns lightly to
thoughts of summer examinations.
In fact the onset of decent weather,
even if it be only for a short period,
has mellowed me to such an extent
that I find it well nigh impossible
to rant about anything - just to
practice my lizard impression on the
grass of Beit Quad.
The Union Council last Monday
was worrying. Not that it was any
more worrying than previous ones
- the lack of interest displayed on
the part of Union members and the
aggression' displayed by some
sabbaticals towards difficult
questioners is rapidly becoming the
norm. I have a tendency to keep
quiet during these meetings
because, apart from an intense
dislike of anything approaching
public speaking, anything I say has
been treated in the past as the
whingeing of a troublemaker.
Which may well be true - it happens
to be my job. Penguin (Marc Ellis),
the Rag Chair, tried to bring some
debate to the meeting but was put
down aggresively by the acting
chair who seemed more eager to
bring the meeting to an early close
rather than for Council to debate the
issues.
Within the next few years it is
very likely that the Conservative
government will succeed in
breaking up the National Union of
Students through the introduction of
voluntary membership - I have
already explained in previous
editorials what this will entail. The
lack of interest and participation in
Council this week, and in the E G M
last week, is indicative that IC
Union will either cease to exist or
continue in a much reduced form
when this legislation goes through.
The problem may be that few
students around college realise the
benefits offered by the Union and
take its facilities for granted.
Without a Union grant there
would be no Felix or IC Radio -
many people would say this was no
great loss, but closely followed by
these closures would be the massive
reduction in the travel subsidies to
the Athletic and Recreational Clubs,
forcing fees to increase and the
number of teams and events to be
reduced. The Welfare service
offered by the Union would stop,
student representation on college
committees would stop and without
this the students would have even
less control or knowledge of
accomodation changes or anything
The things people do for money.
Last Sunday thirteen people flung themselves from a 150ft crane in Derby
to raise money for UNICEF through ICU Rag. More information is given
overleaf. This is a picture of Steve Newhouse, ICU SCC Chair, Duty
Officer, Collating Machine Tamer, Felix
Contributor and Bureaucrat
Extraordinaire looking forward
to the next Union
Council meeting.

else that college does to us.
Each member of college belongs
to two Unions - Imperial College
Union and their Constituent College
Union. The CCUs are funded by
ICU and if the grant that ICU has
to distribute is reduced, then the
amount given to the CCUs would
also reduce. Probably to the point
where the only role they could
fulfill around college would be that
of representation as they would no
longer have the funds to support
their own clubs or sport teams.

Hon Sec Bit
What a busy week our lovely Rag
people are having. Hypnosis
already done and lots more to come.
The prospect of bopping to Abba
and 70s music is a must for any self-
respecting student (except for the
clothes). So get on down to the
Lounge tonight. Rumours that
Jonathan has lots of spare outfits for
tonight are greatly exaggerated.
(Although he's definitely old
enough). Then it's pig-frying and
fun time tomorrow at the Rag Fete.
Definitely the Rag event of term and
better than looking at the bread in
Sainbury's on a Saturday.
Most Extraordinary Meetings
EGMs and General Meetings do
exist for a purpose. They're for
policy decisions, quizzing
sabbaticals and other officers and
having a say in how the Union
works. The last E G M was a mess
because a) I couldn't get a PA and
b) nobody turned up. So if you
came you could have questioned
why I had no PA, even if you
wouldn't have heard the answers!
However there is an E G M on
Thursday 28 May in the JCR at
lpm. If you want to vote for next
year's House Committee Chair or
various other posts then turn up.
Third World First have their motion
re-submitted and any further
motions should be handed in at the
Union Office by 12.30pm next
Thursday.
