Letters Felix 934 15 May 1992
Inhuman Management Bar Assault
Dear Adam.
I would be grateful for the chance
to set right a small error in the letter
you published in last week's Felix
under the heading 'Examination
Leaked.'
Contrary to a widely held view
among students, the Management
School is not a part of the
Humanities Programme. The staff
of the Management School commit
their peccadilloes; we commit ours
Confusion
Dear Adam.
I would like to point out that the
article 'Financial Confusion' in
issue 933 of Felix was in error in
reporting a payment of £ 5 0 to the
Nursery by Silwood Student's
Union.
At no time has the Union funded
the Nursery and the implication that
Silwood Union members might
have been involved in illegal use of
funds is entirely incorrect.
Yours sincerely.
Nigel Varndell. Silwood Park
Chair.
Instinctive
Dear Felix,
It's only fair to give a true
account of Basic Instinct, the large
majority who saw the film would
say that Boris (who did the first
review) is either a virgin or was too
busy trying to keep his 'hard on'
under control to view the film
properly.
So here's a majority view. The
film is everything you could want:
murder, sex, mystery, humour,
horror and all in one hell of a plot.
Unlike many films, it was difficult
to guess the ending.
The murder scenes are bloody
and graphic, the sex is shocking and
explicit. (I wonder how many tried
the scenes after). Contrary to Boris
the film is very deep and
psychological. If you're watching
carefully (Boris) the psychology
will do you some damage (do your
head in).
Boris, how can the film be about
the director's fears when he didn't
write the script. Joe Eszterhas,
former Rolling Stone reporter wrote
the script and Paul Verhoevans
directed the film. The two minds
put together created a well made
film that weaves in the mind of the
audience and proves provocative for
quite independently. The confusion
probably arises because our service
course often compete for the same
slots in the timetable.
Incidentally, I enjoyed Rony
Douek's article on Japan, and not
only for the publicity it gave to our
Humanities Japanese course.
All good wishes for the future
success of the paper.
Yours sincerely,
Eric Stables.

Boris's comparison with
Robocop and Total Recall is bang
out of order, these are slam-bang
fantasies and their alibi is not
available for Basic Instinct.
Boris should stick to playing with
himself and everybody should go
see the film. It's the business! (No
offence intended) S.T.P.

It's nice to see the subtle art of
intelligent debate returning to the
hallowed corridors of IC, but
returning to the above letter, if
anybody wants to reviewfilmsfor
Felix, then they are at total liberty
to do so. It reflects far more on
Mr Stokes than on Boris that the
former throws a strop at a review
of afilmhe personally liked. And
an unpleasantly personal strop at
somebody he has never met, at
that. Reviews are, by nature,
opinions. Such puerile
correspondence serves no purpose
- not only does his 'revised review'
sound like he has got shares in the
film, but he also sounds like a
spoilt brat having a tantrum.

Dear Adam.
On Thursday 7th May a friend
and I were physically assaulted in
Southside Bar.
In no way could you describe our
dress or manner as provocative (we
both have steady boyfriends) we
were simply going to have a drink,
a dance and enjoy each other's
company.
Whilst on the corner of the
dancefloor a group of five blokes
singled me out. All five pointed at
me with fully extended arms,
obviously trying to bring undue
attention to myself. This was
repeated every few minutes for
about half an hour.
We initially tried to ignore them
but their persistance was ruining our
evening. As an impulsive act of
desperation I strode up to the
'ringleader', held out my hand for
his drink, promptly threw it back in
his face and said: 'It's rude to
point'. To protect themselves from
humilitation one of the group
retaliated with his drink. The
ringleader followed us as we moved
off the dancefloor and threw
another drink at me. Most of the
dancefloor must have been aware
what was going on. The group then
went away laughing.
Several minutes later the
ringleader approached us. We
thought he'd come to apologise, but
he'd come to hassle us more. At this
point my friend screamed at him
several times to 'fuck off. He
moved away and immediately
another forcefully grabbed hold of
her from behind, pulling her away
Dear Felix,
We would like to let you know
that your review of 'Shakespears
Sister' at the T & C was complete
bullshit. In fact, it sounds as if your
reviewer, Lise Yates, did not even
attend the concert and wrote the
review after hearing the Radio 1
broadcast of the above. She was
either suffering from a severe case
of PMT at the time, or she has the
musical taste of a leek.
There seemed to be a vast number
of people there that were having a
great time, within 'The Shimmering
World of Shakespears Sister'.
If she wants to be a critic of any
worth, then she would be wise to
check her facts prior to writing a
review which has the credibility of
the Los Angeles legal system.
We think she will find; (on
actually listening to some
with him, with obvious intentions.
She spun round and with her free
arm, knocked him around the head
and kneed him in the groin. Only
being successful in escaping from
his grip by the speed and manner
of her defence.
This happened directly in front of
the DJs.
At this point we thought it best
to leave but were frightened to leave
alone as they were 5 and we were
only 2. Fortunately we found a male
friend in the bar who walked us to
our bikes and on our way.
The reason for this article is to
express our disgust to the attitude
of a minority of IC males. Although
it is only a minority this is not an
isolated case. We alone have
suffered two other assaults. I'm
sure we're not the only victims. As
well as degrading it is extremely
infuriating that such men can get
away with such action and do it
again.
At the time of the occurence,
there was no one to turn to, to help
us or prevent the incident. This lack
of security is also true of the Union
Building. This cannot be allowed to
continue. More funding to Union
Security is required. Any person
there to uphold security would
notice these frequent disturbances
and stop them. Any security would
be easily recognisable (i.e. by
dress) for all such victims. Ask
yourself what would have happened
had they decided to follow us home.
It shouldn't be necessary for us to
take our own bodyguards.

Mr A ' (?) is in fact entitled
'Goodbye Cruel World', and that
their next single, T Don't Care' has
not actually been released yet.
although this evidently will not
mean that much to Lise.
Finally, we would like to add that
Marcie's four octave voice sounded
incredible. If she did seem 'to lose
it', this was entirely due to the fact
that she was recovering from
laryngitis, which had caused some
of their tour to be cancelled—again,
a trivial and irrelevant detail.
Get yourself another reviewer,
Felix, or you too could be history.
Yours knowingly, and yours
factually.
