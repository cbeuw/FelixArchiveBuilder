Memoirs of an Invisible Man
Does anyone out there remember
those old, unrealistic, terrifying
(well, maybe for an eight year old)
episodes of the Invisible Man on the
telly? You know, the ones that used
the same invisibility gags (about
two of them) throughout every
series, and that the above mentioned
man walked around covered in
make-up all the time? Yes, well you
may just find this rendition mildly
entertaining, certainly not
underpant soiling material.
The film stars Chevy Chase and
Nick Halloway, a stock analyst who
is introduced one night to Alice
(Daryl Hannah), sparks fly, hot and
steamy they get—well, about
enough to reduce their purity test
scores by about one per cent (this
is a PG you know)—and they agree
to meet later that week.
The next morning Nick attends a
presentation at Magnascopic
Research Laboratories. He finds the
lecture about subatomic particles,
and magnetic flux, (surprisingly)
boring. He goes for a nice relaxing
sauna—in his suit. On the way he
causes a technician to set off a
cyclotron, triggering an alarm and
evacuating the building. Nick
sleeping serenely in the sauna is
oblivous. On awakening Nick is
astonished to notice that portions of
the building around him have
disappeared and even worse so has
he!
On the scene at that moment is
David Jenkins (Sam Neill), a crafty
C I A operative, who having
discovered what happened to Nick,
realises he has something invaluable
on his hands and moves to capture
his ephemeral (I like that word)
prey, and so begins the chasing and
running.
I really did expect a funnier
script, there are bouts of humour
but Chevy Chase has been in far,
far funnier roles. Daryl Hannah is
so wooden in her role as to almost
take on tree-like dimensions and
Sam Neill is about as unnerving as
Edd the Duck coming at you with
a rolled up copy of 'Fishing for Fun
Weekly' (i.e. not very).
The films' only saving grace are
the jubberly special F X , done by the
same team as T2 etc. In fact when
it rains Chevy Chase almost lookes
like the T1000!
Everything about this film says
mild, and the fact that we
sometimes see the man and other
times not, may well be necessary it
is often distorting. In fact, if asked
whether to meet this film or the man
who cleans the toilets, I'd go for
Wee Jimmy Poo Pong McPlop...
every time.
Poo.
Scorchers
I'm in two minds about this film.
Strange, because it seemed like two
different films.
The first, a sort of sentimental
and supposedly heart-wrenching T
miss my M o m ' effort is so
cringable, so wincing I feel its
hardly worth a mention.
Dolan (father), Splendid
(daughter) and Jumper (husband of
Splendid, married for a few hours)
play out a wedding night scene that
is hard to imagine. Their names are
rather apt, except perhaps Dolan,
who should be Dylan. It all begins
well enough, but the ending!
Splendid pretends to be her mother,
who died giving birth to her, to ask
for her approval. Confused? Don't
bother.
In another film, taking place in
another part of town, a far better
scene is being acted out. A drunk,
a barman, a whore and a wife, who
the whore is sleeping with try their
hands at solving a few of life's
problems, including why people
like classical music. It may sound
corny but has a feeling of been
there, tried that, we didn't get any
answers either.
The best performances are by
those in the bar, Denholm Elliot as
Howler (the drunk) and James Earl
Jones as Bear (the barman) shines
like the a star in the pitch black sky.
Indeed, a better film could have
been based around the bar, with a
few incidental characters wandering
ever so often.
Overall this film seems to lack
something. Despite attempts to pull
the two parts of the film together
(the Preacher is late for the wedding
of Splendid, and Jumper because
he's having sex with the whore),
there is no real ending. M y best
memory of the film is probably the
laughs of the audience when Bear
asks Howler why he left the theatre.
If you want my advice (and if not
why are you reading this?), wait for
this to move to the cheaper cinemas,
or even video.

Yep, sure does Peb.
Bad Blood
The third and last play from quite
a long way away produced by the
Gate Teatre in its Beyond-Europe
season is Bad Blood by the
contemporary Argentinian
playwright Griselda Gambaro. The
play deals with machoism and
violence. The Father, a governor,
oppresses his wife and daughter
Dolores and everybody else around
him. His marriage arrangements for
Dolores seem jeopardized,
however, as she falls in love with
her hunchbacked houseteacher.
They plan to escape from "this
savage town, where the best heads
end up in barrels and the best sound
is silence."
The most gripping scene is when
Dolores stands up against her father
for the first time, but most of the
time the play is too predictable. I
thought Dolores' love for her
teacher came a bit quick and wasn't
very convincing. Also, I found the
image of the hunchback as the only
straight person a bit tired. And why
is the tea served in tin cups in the
house of the gouernor? I'm not so
sure of and the production is a bit
wishy-washy (except for the stage
set, which is very good).
