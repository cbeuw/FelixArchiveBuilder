Clubs & Societies Felix 934 15 May 1992
The IC First Eight travelled to
Japan last week, courtesy of Fuji
T V , in order to compete at the third
'Henley Regatta in Japan'. After a
day spent meticulously preparing a
borrowed boat at the Toda Olympic
rowing course and assessing the
opposition, the crew transferred to
the Sumida River in the centre of
Tokyo.
The regatta comprised of four
semi-finals, with the winners
progressing to the final. IC were
drawn against a powerful crew from
the University of California, Los
Angeles and two local Japanese
universities. The Americans had
five international oarsmen on
board, one of which had competed
in the 1988 Olympics.
Rowing against a strong wind and
tide, IC convincingly earned a place
in the final. However, the
University of Bristol qualified in
their semi-final recording a faster
time. Waseda University, from
Japan, also made the final yet again.
Then the tide turned, against the
wind, whipping up huge waves that
propagated down the river,
rebounding off the concrete walls
- true sinking conditions for these
frail, lightweight craft. The IC
crew, weighing in 71 kg heavier in
total than their nearest rivals, Nihon
University, then realised how small
their boat was, but arrived at the
start determined to win.
In the final, IC went off to a good
start and, despite ploughing through
the waves rather than riding over
them, were five lengths up on
Bristol after only two minutes.
Nihon, however, were much faster
and were using their advantageous
lane to good ettect.
The crews battled alongside past
the largely partisan crowd, while a
T V helicopter followed overhead;
IC would edge ahead and then be
impeded by a massive, drenching
wave. Bristol were found wanting
in these appalling conditions and
eventually stopped before
embarrassingly going ashore.
Meanwhile IC, with the aid of
judicious steering, pushed on and
crossed the line three-quarters of a
length ahead of Nihon, who
promptly sank at the finish. IC
baled out the water from their boat
continuously as they crept slowly
back to the landing stage, receiving
rapturous applause from the crowd.
The whole race had been
spectacularly televised, with
overhead and close-up shots that put
the BBC to shame! The crews
be proud of the diplomacy and
goodwill shown by its oarsman
across the world.

flooding rivers - all in pouring rain
- it was slightly disappointing to
discover that the actual route
involved nothing more than a
leisurely, if not entirely scenic,
stroll along a main road.
In true I C U Y H A tradition spirits
were soon raised again though, with
Dramboie salutes all round (and all
up the walls in some cases). Then,
after a final tipple of that magic
treacly brew, we set off for home.
Imperialism in Japan
watched the replay with pride. Any
crew surviving those conditions
deserved to win, but of course, IC
had retained their title.
After the traditional exchanging
of kit, the crews attended the
presentation and reception before
embarking on a night of celebration.
Before leaving Japan, the visiting
teams were given a day-long tour
of the city, culminating in an
evening at the Tokyo Disneyland.
The whole trip was an
unforgettable experience. The
period of fame and stardom may
have been brief, but the reputation
of the Boat Club is truly
international. Imperial College can
rish Walking Excursion
I C U Y H A broke the tradition of
heading to Scotland for the Easter
tour this year and, in an inspired
and popular move, set sail for the
Emerald Isle instead.
The choice of Killarney as our
base for the trip was a good one.
The town itself was full of placards
extolling the virtues of Guinness
and, perhaps even more
importantly, there was an
abundance of wonderful walking
country within easy reach of our
camp-site. (We are after all a
walking club and not a drinking
club; although occasionally
confusion on the issue is quite
understandable...)
Despite the astonishingly
unpredictable weather, most people
ventured out on most days to
discover the joys of the diverse Irish
countryside. On one of the two icy
mornings though, even the prospect
of a pleasant days walk with
excellent scenery and jovial
company wasn't enough to lure
everyone out of their tents. Hearty,
if not entirely harmonious
renditions of Dubliners songs,
together with threats of cold
porridge in the sleeping bag usually
did the trick however.
During the week there were
strolls around the picturesque lakes
of Killarney, walks across the
bleak, heathery hills of the
Muckross Estate national park and
days spent sampling the rugged and
very spectacular coastal scenery.
On one particular coastal walk we
were accompanied by a travelling
musician (Irish rover) who played
the mandolin and wore a ring of
bells around his ankle. As cliched
as it seemed, we all agreed that this
was the type of thing that could only
happen in Ireland. Having taught us
several new Irish folk tunes, our
wandering minstrel friend then
introduced us to one of the locals
- the Dingle Bay dolphin. Perhaps
on advice from his more famous
English counterpart, the dolphin
was decidedly cautious when two
momentarily mad walkers dived
into the freezing water to swim with
him. He had no objections to photos
being taken though, and between us
we now have a collection of twenty
or more identically uninteresting
shots showing the tip of a small grey
fin in a vast grey expanse of water.
Much more spectacular was the
greatly anticipated 'Mac
Gillicuddys Reeks' range. This
notorious series of high serrated
ridges was conquered on the second
last day by a brave party of four (ie
all those who did not have
hangovers). The walk commenced
at Kate Kearneys Cottage by the
Gap of Dunloe and followed the
route across the Reeks to Lough
Acoose, taking in Ireland's highest
peak - Carrantoohill (3414ft) - on
the way. Even though it snowed and
was misty for part of the way, the
walk was unanimously voted as the
best in Ireland; quite an accolade
given the quality of the competition.
After the 'near death experience'
of the Reeks, there was a mildly
embarrassing incident the following
day when a group of seven managed
to get completely and utterly lost on
'The Kerry Way'. After trudging
for hours through fields thick with
gorse, circumnavigating huge pine
plantations and wading through
2nd Eight Success
The IC Boat Club's second eight
followed the success of its first eight
from five days earlier with a win in
the Senior B and Elite eights at
Trinity College Regatta, Dublin this
weekend. Despite not being pushed
in either event over the two days,
they succeeded in becoming only
the second crew ever to break five
minutes over the 1800m course.
The crew was summed up by the
Irish Tribune as a 'model of
streamlined power', and according
to the Independent, 'represented
one of the strongest overseas entries
in recent years'.
All this from only a second eight!
