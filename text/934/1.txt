IC Day Nursery Birthday Party
Imperial College Day Nursery is
celebrating its 21st birthday today
(Friday) by holding a 'Nursery
Awareness Day'. The day will
feature a 'Celebrity Pram Race'
around Prince's Gardens with
barrels of beer awarded for the
outright winner; the most beautiful
celebrity baby and the most
technologically advanced pram
design. The prizes have been
sponsored by IC Students' Union.
After the 'Pram Prix' the Nursery
will be holding 'Barfly Jumping'
between 6.00pm and 9.00pm.
In clarification of last week's
story headlined 'Financial
Confusion' concerning ultra vires
payments. Silwood Park Students
Union did not pay Â£50 to the
Silwood Park Day Nursery, and the
story was never intended to mean
that. The article stated that Imperial
College Union had instructed
Silwood Students' Union not to
make the payment. We apologise
for any ambiguity in the wording.
RCSU in trouble
The financial autonomy of
Imperial's Constituent College
Unions (CCUs) is set to undergo a
period of realignment following the
recent scare at Imperial College
Union over ultra vires (out of rules)
payments. ICU sources indicate that
the CCUs are believed to exercise
financial irresponsibility, and that
their apparent and alleged
recklessness could leave the parent
IC Union liable on a charge of ultra
vires payments.
The suggestions of plans to
increase the financial accountability
of C C U s to I C U follows
precautionary moves taken by Ken
Bignell, the Senior Treasurer of the
Royal College of Science C C U
(RCSU). Mr Bignell this week
informed IC Union trading outlets
that the RCSU was to be accorded
a zero credit rating, which
effectively means that all official
R C S U orders had to be
accompanied by cash payment
before they could be fulfilled.
It is reported that M r Bignell is
refusing to sign any further cheques
until financial procedures within the
RCSU have been considerably
tightened. RCSU sources have
reacted furiously to the rumours that
swept the college that the RCSU
was on the verge of bankruptcy.
RCSU President, Angie Creissen,
said that the Senior Treasurer's
move was due to 'general office
incompetence.' Speaking to iCNN,
Miss Creissen said that 'the kick up
the arse approach' had not worked,
and that 'maybe the Armageddon
approach will.'
Other sources say that the RCSU
could not be bankrupt as they are
reported to have considerable cash
reserves. The administration of
Imperial College have indicated to
Imperial College Union that union
cash reserves will have to be
significantly reduced over the
immediate future. The extent of the
hardening line of college was
indicated by the report given to ICU
Council on Monday by ICU Deputy
President, Jonathan Griffiths. M r
Griffiths, who is responsible for
ICU finances, wrote of 'ironing out
financial regulations which college
are asking for.'
The degree of financial autonomy
of the constituent college unions is
at best a nebulous concept. While
the CCUs argue that they are
completely autonomous financially
from ICU, the college union says
that as they pay out C C U grants,
then they could be held responsible
for any illegal spending on the part
of the CCUs.
Union sources have indicated that
the expenditure of grant money on
complementary C C U ball tickets is
ultra vires. The money is used to
An inmate of IC Nursery at play on Thursday
pay for the cost of each C C U
sending complementary tickets,
some of which go to other C C U
senior officers. A financial opinion
sought by (CNN indicates that this
payment is regarded as 'subsidising
food and drink.' It is then a matter
of debate as to whether this
constitutes an ultra vires payment.
Our source informs us that while
subsidising food and drink for
fresher's events is regarded as a
legal payment, the subsidising of
subsequent 'food and drink' events
is ultra vires because they are not
primarily aimed at bring freshers
together for educational and social
benefit. This construction is not
immediately apparent from the
letter of guidance issued by the
Attorney General's office on the
matter in 1983, and referred to in
last week's Felix. A second
financial expert contacted by /CNN
has indicated that the subsidising of
the C C U complementary tickets

Art Fire
A serious fire broke out on the
fourth floor of the Royal College of
Art (RCA) on Kensington Gore
yesterday (Thursday). The fire
occured in a workshop in the silver
