Feature Felix 934 15 May 1992
A group from the Imperial
College and North Wales Caving
Clubs visited the Monte Canin area
in August 1991 for a mixture of
tourist caving and prospecting,
helped by the caving group of
Udine. This article is intended as an
introduction to caving in the area,
but does not attempt to deal with the
intricacies of the route finding,
above or below ground. It's left to
the visiting caver to enjoy that part.
The caves are predominantly
vertical, active shaft systems, fairly
cold, with rock that is often sharp,
so careful rebelaying is required.
The lack of any formations might
make some feel that the caves lack
character, being more of a test of
rigging skills. Such cavers are
probably best despatched to the
show caves of neighbouring
Slovenia, where there is abundant
stal; whilst 'depth junkie' cavers get
on with the sport.
Up until 1989 the deepest system
on the plateau, and the only one
with significant horizontal
development, was the Complesso
del Col delle Erbe at -935m,
between 700m and 800m deep. The
Gortani system has a top entrance
at 1928m and the water resurges at
the Fontana di Goriuda, 2km to the
NW at 868m altitude. It is likely
that the remaining 125m vertical
potential is flooded. In summer
1991, ropes were in place on the
'Via nuova' route, and we
understood that they are replaced
every four years.
The situation has now completely
changed with the discovery of two
caves on the Yugoslavian side of the
ridge. Veliko Sbrego involves a
520m 'entrance series' of pitches,
followed by 5km of active river
passage reaching—1198m. With the

caves pre-rigged, it currently takes
40 hours to travel to the end of the
cave and back. Exploration time
must be added on to that! Skalaria
has been pushed to —995m, and
both caves still have many leads in
them. Not surprisingly, they have
attracted cavers from far afield.
Thunderstorms can occur
frequently. Whilst from the
Gortani, one group were delayed
for 8 hours at —550m until water
levels on the pitches had subsided.
Some of the caves might first
have been visited during World
War 1, when the ridge formed the
border between Italy and Austria-
Hungary, and was the scene of
fierce fighting in which 2,000
soliders lost their lives. The area
today has many look-out posts, rock
trenches and tunnels with rusty
shells and grenades scattered about.

A Michele Gortani. The plateau is
being chiefly worked on by cavers
from Udine and Trieste. The
Trieste groups (CGEB and SAG)
have been responsible for the finds
on the western part of the plateau,
from the Cuel Sclaf to Monte Poriz.
The Udine group (CSIF) have been
working on Col Lopic and Monte
Robon, with unprospected
limestone further east. Members of
British clubs (MUSS, B C C , BPC)
visited the area in the 1970s, mainly

to assist in the exploration of the
Comici.
The area (8km x 2km) is not
intensively caved. During four
weeks in Summer 1991 we only met
other caving groups on three
occasions. The future potential is
enormous.
The remoteness of the caves
makes rescue a very serious
proposition. During the exploration
of Veliko Sbrego, an accident drew
cavers from all over northeast Italy
on a major operation that lasted
several days. Our closest call was
during a four-man trip to the bottom
of the Gortani. One of the group
missed the turn-off to the terminal
siphon and ended up falling 20m
into it from a slippery ledge above,
hitting the rock walls on the way
down. He escaped with damaged
forearm ligaments and a gashed
face, and managed to struggle out
from —892m with one good arm,
mild hypothermia and recurring
double-vision, albeit in a total trip
time of 28 hours!
Sella Nevea, at 1170m is the most
suitable place from which to base
exploration of the area. The ski
resort is rather small, with a lack
of caving essentials such as cheap
accommodation, bars, restaurants
and food shops. At the Western end
is a field allocated for camping, but
since it has no facilities, discreet
roadside camping, to the east and
outside of the village, is just as
good. The CAI Rifugio Julia is
another possibility, if your budget
will stretch. The nearest
supermarket is the small one in
Tarvisio, a 30 minutes drive to the
northeast. There does not even
seem to be a 'superstore' in Udine,
so it might be worth buying cheaply
in bulk before arriving in the area.
Access to the plateau is by the
cable car ('Funivia'), with a return
charge of about £5 to climb 700m
in a few minutes. Well worth it!
During the descent, two or three
days later, with the cable car filled
with dirty, tanned, hungry, stinking
cavers and countless muddy tackle
sacs, it was always fun to watch the
disbelief on the faces of the tourists.

The cable car offers rapid access
to the plateau in winter, from where
local cavers have skiied to reach
caves, often kept clear of snow by
the draught from within. Winter
brings extra risks though. The
Bivacco Davanzo-Vianello-Picciola
is named in memory of the first
three cavers to reach the bottom of
the Gortani, but who were swept
away by an avalanche on return
from the same trip as they
descended in the dark towards the
lights of the Rifugio Gilberti.

on the eastern end of the plateau,
it makes better sense to use Sentieri
637, despite the one and a half hour
ascent. All the paths marked on the
map are well marked on the ground,
but there are no others, the rest of
the terrain being hard-going over
scree or pavement.
Camping is not really feasible on
the plateau, mainly because of the
lack of soil, the frequent storms,
and the existence of perfectly good
bivouac huts. The Bivacco DVP (as
named before) at 1930m is used as

the base for exploring the Gortani,
while the Bivacco Modonutti-
Savoia at 1900m is used for the cave
of the same name. They both
provide bunk beds for 12 and a
cooking stove (bring your own gas).
Water is collected from nearby
snow patches and rivulets, but is not
plentiful.
Unfortunately, being partly
funded by the CAI, the bivouacs are
not locked, and are open to all,
which means regular visits during
the day by walkers. Our group had
500m of rope and 50 hangers stolen
from a hiding place near the
Bivacco MS. Be warned! The
Rifugio Gilberti at 1850m is busy
during the day, but in the evening,
after the last cable car has
descended, it provides a great place
to seek warm shelter and gaze out
over the limestone bathed in
crimson light, whilst sampling the
well-stocked bar...
Up-Date
IC is planning a return for 1992 to
concentrate on prospecting and
extending known caves. Any other
cavers thinking of visiting the area
are welcome to contact the club for
more information and contact
address for the Italian Clubs, with
whom co-operation is essential.
