Most of us quite like the sound of
alternative technology. It promises
to be clean and renewable to the end
of time. No longer would we feel
so guilty about leaving lights or the
television remote control on when
we don't need them, because
conventional power stations would
be a thing of the past. They would
no longer be there to billow carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere. Roads
would be cleaner and somehow
quieter; life would be very nice,
thankyou.
But I think there is something in
most of us which says 'wait a
minute - this is just a wee bit too
perfect. There has to be a catch to
all this.' You tend to feel--as ,I
imagine you would upon hearing
the news that you had won a
timeshare apartment... 'and all you
have to do to claim your fabulous
prize is book an appointment with
one of our salespeople...' In a word
you would feel dubious, which is a
bit how I felt upon arrival at the
Centre for Alternative Technology
in the heart of the Welsh
countryside. I honestly support
anything which will reduce mans'
impact on the environment, but I
was worried that it would all turn
out to be unworkable and a disap-
pointment. Maybe we would get
there to find the place staffed by
ageing hippies who had somehow
escaped from the sixties.
I was to be pleasantly surprised.
I arrived at the house where I was
stay at about midnight. It had
seemed a long journey, so I was

glad to receive a warm welcome
and an even warmer milky drink
before I went to bed. I awoke the
next morning to find someone in the
kitchen cooking copious quantities
of breakfast. The smell was wafting
temptingly up the stairs, so what
could I do to resist? I took the
opportunity to look around; there
was an array of organically grown
food on the farmhouse style table,
and the shelves above the sink held
jars of all kinds of things which
reminded me of an old-fashioned
sweet shop. My wander took me
into the lounge, where I nearly fell
over a sleeping man, who said, 'Hi,
I'm Dave, I help here...' and
promptly went back to the land of
slumber.
In the meantime, everyone else
was up, so we trudged off to earn
our keep. We were told beforehand
that we would be working on the
lake, which to me just looked
ornamental but I was assured that
it would be used to generate
electricity when there was a
shortfall. We levelled out ground,
sorted out boulders to go around the
perimeter of the lake and dug a hole
for a reason I never quite
understood. Everyone felt that it
was okay for the day, but on the
whole we were glad we had settled
for an academic career! We all
wanted to have a bath after a day
in the grime, but we were
disappointed with the solar panel
water heatingâ€”or rather lack of it.
So we descended on the local
hostelry in true Imperial College
style whilst others in our group who
were a bit more cultured stayed in
to watch some videos - even here
they had televisions and videos.
