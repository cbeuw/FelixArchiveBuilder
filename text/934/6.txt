If this performance is anything to
go by kd lang has taken up the
mantle of a much loved comic
institution, she is the Minister of
Silly Walks. Stomping around in
biker's square-toed boots and a
gentleman's smoking jacket would
not have been the done thing for the
folkabilly queen a few years ago,
let alone John Cleese impressions.
However, with the new LP Ingenue
(meaning artless, young woman) it
had been said that the twang of
Patsy Cline had been replaced by
Edith Piafs Torch. Whilst the
change in style of Ingenue is
dramatic, her heart appears to have
stayed true to its roots in live
performances at least.
The set was faithfully carted out
from the aforementioned, but it was
the older material from 'Absolute
Torch and Twang' and even 'Angel
with a Lariat' that captured the true
gut-wrenching power and
enthusiasm expected from her live
work. Backed by a seven-piece
band, the compositions were varied
and even experimental at times, one
felt. In between, there were long
pauses as kd padded round the stage
pausing only to intimidate members
of the front row.
The highlight must have been the
avant-garde version of 'Big Boned
G i r l ' . Complete with a
demonstration of the accompanying
silly walk and hip thrusting. She
finished with Cline's 'Stop, Look
and Listen'. Unfortunately few of
the audience appeared to recognise
it, but that's the price you pay for
being kd lang, erstwhile chanteuse
of hop, step and fiddle.

Soupdragon? Who is it today?
T wanna be in EMF...you're an
unbelievable thing...no wait...can
I be Bobby Gillespie out of Primal
Scream?'
No. I think someone's already
being him.
'How about if I did a sort of duet
with Yello. Could I be in Primal
Scream then?-'
No.
'But I've just bought
'Screamadelica'. I thought seeing as
it was so successful, I could just sort
of redo it, throw in a couple of U2
guitar bits when it gets a bit boring,
and I've taken a couple of the good
tracks off Primal Scream 'cos I
thought they went well together,
and it saves the money if you can
get the best of both albums on the
same disc, and then I could be in
Primal Scream too. And then I
could meet Kylie too. That's what
I want.'
Well you can't. You have no
credibility. Make up your mind.
What do you want to be?
T want to be with Prudential.'
