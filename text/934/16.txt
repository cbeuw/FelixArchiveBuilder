15 May 1992 Felix 934 Opinion
and their response ranged from
patronising to insulting to childish
to personal. A poor reflection on
their own maturity.
I mention a dangerous precedent,
because Penguin wasn't the only
one to suggest new job descriptions.
Union president, Zoe Hellinger,
tabled a motion to amend the
current job descriptions of the
sabbaticals. And you thought they
didn't have one? The main change
was outlined in Zoe's report. Tn
response to a member of Council
the office sabbaticals have now
started filling in time sheets, as we
are accountable to students any
students who wish to see these
sheets can look at them in my
office.'
This ignores three important
considerations. Firstly, students
will not know to check time sheets
because they at this stage are
unaware of their existence.
Secondly, filling time sheets does
not guarantee in itself that
constructive work is being done by
sabbaticals, though there is no
reason to doubt that this does not
happen anyway. They do, after all,
get along. Thirdly, this decision
was reached without consultation
with students. It may not be
important enough to justify a
college wide ballot, but with
government reform of student
unions a racing certainty, then any
suggestion of an undemocratic
structure will lead to disaster for the
union.
This opens up a very serious
question. How accountable are our
union sabbaticals and officers? This
is of critical importance. Those
among the rabid right in
Conservative Students are pushing
very hard indeed for wholesale
reform of student unions. One of
the national officers of Conservative
Students told me last Friday that in
the same way that the government
reformed trade unions in the 1980s,
then so student unions would be
reformed in the 1990s. The end
could well be nigh for student
unions as we know them.
Theoretically, the procedures to
hold Union sabbaticals accountable
for their actions is in place. The
enigma is in implementing these
procedures. Zoe's escape from
being tarred with the brush of
Stalinism in the Independent (6
February this year), suggests that
the precedents are not good.
This is a problem which Zoe is
taking seriously, indeed
courageously so. Her solution is to
produce a promotional brochure to
sell the main benefits of Imperial
College Union. So, when voluntary
membership is introduced, and I
mean when, then the former ICU
members will know what they're
missing, and sign up in droves. It
is nice to see an important piece of
forward planning. But look over
your shoulder a bit. Why do we
have the Union Handbook, and how
tenable is its future if the new glossy
brochure is introduced?
Given that most in Imperial
College Union regard the National
Union of Students as an
embarrassing anachronism, and that
the groundswell in favour of forcing
reform in the national union is ever
increasing in London, would it be
an idea for Imperial to blaze a trail
and introduce voluntary
membership on its own, to see how
it works? It's a possible way of
putting the Union to the test of fire,
and may provoke much greater
reform in the NUS than setting up
a rival union, an idea that is gaining
currency in the London School of
Economics.
The imminent threat of imposed
government reform hung heavily
over this particular council meeting.
A whiff of possible financial
regulation came from the Deputy
President, Jonathan Griffiths. Apart
from a possible surprise increase in
Union funding this year, he
announced that a Union Finance
Committee (UFC) meeting would
be held on Thursday 28 May. The
purpose of the meeting is ' fo iron
out a set of financial regulations
which the college are asking for...
show the lines of responsibility as
well as other codes of practice.'
Given the recent scare over ultra
vires (out of rules) payments, and
a hardening ICU line against what
they perceive to be alleged financial
irresponsibility of the part of
constituent college unions (CCUs),
then this U F C could be an
especially bruising encounter. It
may also finally and firmly define
the exact revised financial status and
relative accountability of CCUs and
ICU. Could it lead to a permanent
erosion of the so-called financial
autonomy of the CCUs? Watch this
space.
If you want to find out what
happened at Monday's council
through the official channels, don't
hold your breath, or your water.
. if sabbaticals
wish to disown
or not be
involved in the
work of Major
Subcommittees
then I, for one,
would be happy
to remove them
from our
constitution... •
The minutes won't be published
until just before the next council,
through no-one's fault. Things have
always been done this way. Though
theoretically you are able to inspect
the minutes, when was the last time
you were told this? Be original. Try
asking for them. The new buzz
word is accountability.
