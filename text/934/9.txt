Tis Pity She's a Whore
Giovanni, a brilliant young man, is
madly in love with beautiful
Anabella. She is chased by noble
and rich bachelors of Parma, but
her heart belongs to Giovanni.
Their love has to be secret,
however, for the two are brother
and sister. Only two people know
of the incest: Annabella's tutoress,
who finds nothing wrong with it,
and Friar Bonaventura. Giovanni is
too intelligent to be impressed by
the Friar's fire-and-brimstone
speeches, yet too naive to grasp the
worldly implications of his sin.
Annabella is more susceptible to the
Friar's theology and marries a
nobleman to save her soul from
damnation. At that time, however,
she already knows she is pregnant.
This is only the main line of
action in Shakespeare-
contemporary John Ford's 'Tis Pity
She's a Whore. Almost every
character in this unrelenting play
displays dubious morals in some
way. "Justice has fled to heaven
and comes no nearer."
In the Royal Shakespeare
Company's production showing at
the Pit the directness of Ford's play
is preserved. They transposed it into
a beginning- of-the-century Italinan
mafia setting. This is very clever,
for it makes the incredible brutality
in the play plausible today, and it
isn't forced. Saskia Reeves and
Johnathan Cullen are convincing as
Annabella and Giovanni, and
Johnathan Hyde gives a brilliant
impression of a nobleman's ruthless
right hand. If you go, brace yourself
for the end, it's gruesome.

Henry IV Part 2
1 sat down feeling unenthusiastic
and expecting the worst. I was
pleasantly surprised. Again, as in
part one I found the set design
obtrusive and crude. I don't see
why, in a scene in Eastcheap, the
set should get belly laughs all
round. I also found some of the
scenes a little tedious. Many people
seemed to think that Robert
Stephens' Falstaff was excellent. I
disagree. I found his performance
flighty and ineffectual. As the night
went on this became less distracting
as Michael Maloney and Julian
Glover came into their own and
swept me away with their
performances.
It's not difficult to make
Shakespeare powerful, but I think
it's exceptional for it to be moving.
The scene where the King is dying
and Hal takes the cro-
breathtaking. The King ,dressed in
sports top, cut off jogging pants and
unshaven gave a raw portrayal of
a king undone, a defeated man,
who, consumed by his guilt, was
waiting to die. Philip Voss as the
Lord Chief Justice and David
Bradley as the aged, tottering,
Justice Shallow were superb. The
coronation scene was spectacular
and the only occasion in these
productions where I felt that Bob
Crowley's set design gelled.
Overall, I'd recommend seeing
Henry IV parts one and two. Don't
be put off if you've not read (or
studied) the plays, you don't need
to have to be able to enjoy it. The
Barbican do some good deals on
standby tickets for students so it
doesn't have to cost you an arm and
a leg.
