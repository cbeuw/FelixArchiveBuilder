15 May 1992 Felix 934 Feature
The next day I interrogated some
poor girl who was kneading dough
with the food processor. 'We are
connected to the National Grid
aren't we?'
'Oh no', she replied, with a
slightly scolding expression on her
face. 'That goes against everything
we stand for here'. Yet no one I
spoke to seemed obsessed with self-
sufficiency, they just possessed
common sense.
Sunday was the bit we had all
been waiting for—the grand tour of
the area, although I felt I knew the
place a little by now already. We
duly assembled at ten and kicked off
with a tour of an energy efficient
demonstration house. Apparently,
this is one of the major aspects of
the alternative technologies, but it
isn't very newsworthy and it is
difficult to make an interesting
exhibition out of it as well, so we
didn't really dwell on it. Most of the
people living on the site had built
their own houses; an achievement
as not all of them came from a
building background.
Then we were shown the
trademarks of alternative
technology - those aspects everyone
thinks of as soon as that phrase is
mentioned. For instance, wind
turbines, water wheels and solar
panels. This is not to say they were
boring - some of the designs looked
quite innovative.
Next was our guide's pride and
joy - the sewerage system. I hadn't
thought of that as being alternative
technology before, but it was
brilliant in its simplicity of design.
The waste for the site was passed
through a series of tanks which
contained different plants, their role
was to extract all the nutrients from

the water, rendering it safe. The last
tank was even made into an
ornamental pond! What is more,
there was almost no smell at all. I
think that everyone present was
impressed, despite the subject
matter.
The next stop was the organic
garden, which is maintained at least
in part by the school groups who
come to stay. The soil is fertilised
with rotted vegetable peelings and
eggshell from the kitchens. It was
from here onwards that I really
began to see the inter-relatedness of
it all. They grew their own food,
produced their own power and dealt
with the waste afterwards, all
without damaging anything, not
least their standard of living.
However, as our guide admitted,
having the right attitude counts for
a great deal and living in such a
close community can produce
tension at times. Technical teething
troubles can also be a nuisance even
though they are expected, as with
anything new, and progress can
bring moral dilemmas of its own.
For instance, they have just built a
new cliff railway to transport ever
increasing numbers of visitors up
the steep hill, but they will need to
be connected to the National Grid
for the first time ever to provide
back-up power.
In the car on the way home, I
mulled it over. The centre wasn't
the perfect model, but life is never
anywhere near paradise anyway.
The technologies certainly work
and there is no drop in the standard
of living, but communities like this
will never happen until there is
widespread changes of attitude. It
might all sound cranky, but if it
works who can criticise? If you still
aren't sure about the whole thing
then why don't you come and see
for yourself?
