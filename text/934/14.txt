Everything but Windsurfing
'A tribute to Phil and Steve'... or
A momento which will boost their
egos and which they can show to all
their friends and family'.
Well, it has fallen to me to
summarize the year in the
Windsurfing Club, since our
outings will become less and less
frequent as the terrors of exams
loom darkly on the horizon. As 'it's
part of my job' (as Steve told me
- and he did' want his name
mentioned as much as possible), it
wouldn't do for me to get bored
since the club won't be such a relief
force in my life this term.
As they say, 'I'll start from the
very beginning'... no, I'll control
myself and not burst into song. The
autumn term was a very busy time
for the club, with pleasant (well in
England, it couldn't really be
described as 'fantastic') weather
and many beginners. They were all
trying to win the race (to Southside
on Tuesday at 12.30pm) to sign up
for inclusion into 'the elite 13'
going to the reservoir the following
week. All that seems a very long
time ago, including the Gosport
trip, after which the elections for the
post of secretary took place. What
exactly do I recall of that period?
Being very keen to do things to 'get
brownie points' which would be to
my advantage in the elections.
These included Felix articles, if I'm
correct, and not the usual kissing of
babies. There were also lessons at
the reservoir, very occasionally
venturing onto the water when the
weather permitted.
What exactly did we do in
Gosport? Surprisingly, we went
windsurfing! We also played
drinking games, arcade games and,
a few of us, got tied up into a
telephone boxes. Hmmm... I don't
think I'll get changed in the woods
in future. Apart from the shocked
looking passer-bys, there were a
few too many brambles.
Where else did we go? The
Gower was our second trip and yet
again, we did some windsurfing,
and even some surfing. Despite the
freezing cold temperatures, and
breaking the leg off one of the
chairs, we also experienced the
delights of the local Welsh disco.
We were also supposed to go to
Cornwall, but as per usual, our van
was cancelled at the last minute. As
it happens, we had a extremely
successful trip to Wyeboston. There
we went go-karting, piloting and
also used quads. Those were only
the motorsports. We also managed
to do some jetskiing and water-
skiing. We enjoyed ourselves so
much that it was a blessing in
disguise. It wasn't the only non-
windsurfing trip we had that term;
we also had an evening out on the
town - pub-crawling and even
stopping in a karioke bar.
After the Christmas holidays, bad
weather conditions (the cold, ice
and no wind) threatened to force the
club into a unrecoverable decline.
However, the club survived.
Instead of floundering in the
reservoir, we went bowling, played
laser tag and used slides at
Fantaseas Waterpark. One
Wednesday, we even spent some
- a long weekend in Cornwall.
Quite strange setting out on a 7 hour
drive at 6.30 in the evening.
Anyway, those of us who were
relegated to the back of the van had
a great time playing cards and even
being able to lie down comfortably.
Amazingly, it was one of the few
trips we didn't have to put up with
untuneful singing from the front!
time in Richmond Park playing
football and using the skateboards
from the speedsails. Steve, you
were lucky that you didn't injure
yourself on those skateboards,
unlike those on our second trip to
Gosport. What a weekend!. It was
almost cancelled by the van
monster, but in the end we had a
great time sailing. Shame about the
timing of your injury Steve,
especially as it was in the morning
of the first day before the day was
out.
The next two outings occurred in
quick succession. The Friday before
the end of term, we went out for a
club dinner. We all ate well and
drank well. When we had had
enough of the restaurant, we went
on to enjoy the nightlife at the
Union. Luckily we had a day to
recover before going to Wyeboston
once more. This time we had an
even better time, getting covered in
layers of mud, followed by gravel
and mud once again. A longer
number of daylight hours and
warmer weather also helped.
Welcome to the new Executive
members for next year.
The Easter holidays saw the club
travelling further afield then usual'
And most of the words of the songs
we played were known! Thanks
Ian, we love being woken up at
8am, especially after going to sleep
at 4am. Anyway, it was pretty lucky
since the weather was quite tropical
and the wind and waves were good.
As well as windsurfing, we had a
chance to speed sail on the beach.
How is it possible to get burnt in
this country, and in April? Oh well,
maybe we've all developed skin
cancer now. Going to pubs, playing
twister (finally), clubbing and doing
touristy things such as visiting St
Michael's Mount, were on the
agenda. Sadly, due to our general
disruption of the neighbours, we
won't be able to go back to the
holiday park. What a spectacular
crash on that go-kart Phil! No
James, you're not driving next year.
Now it is time to thank Phil and
Steve on behalf of everyone in the
club. Our money and interests could
not have been looked after better.
We've had a fantastic year largely
thanks to you. I hope that was ego
boosting enough, we couldn't
inflate your heads too much.
Despite this, we are going to do all
this and even more next year. We'll
be having friendly races against
other universities. Also, our club T-
shirt should be out. Hmmm... IC
Sharks!
And now our last few words to
you, as you leave us the
responsibilities and step away from
the combat zone... 'BE L U C K -
A A Y OK'

St Mary's Rugby Champs
On the 21st March St Mary's
entered two teams in the National
Medical Schools sevens tournament
in Nottingham. Despite many
injuries and late withdrawals, it was
felt that we had a team capable of
winning the title for the third time
in as many years.
Throughout the tournament the A
team played some of the best sevens
1 have played or seen played by a
Mary's team, and although some
players lacked experience their
determination and graft more than
compensated. We won through to
the final having played four games,
scored 128 points and conceeded
only 4. One referee said after the
quarter final when we beat
Liverpool 40-0, that we played
some of the best student sevens he
had seen for a long time.
The final was against Cardiff,
who had also won through with
ease, and was played in nothing less
than storm conditions. Playing into
the wind in the first half, we
conceeded two early goals, but the
character of the team showed, and
we never let our heads drop or
confidence in our ability waver. We
began the second half 12-6 down,
having pulled back a late first half
goal, and scored twice in the second
half to make the score 18-12 in our
favour. Cardiff never gave up and
in the last play of the game, crossed
our" line to send the game into
sudden death extra time. Having
kicked out on the full from the
restart we were forced to defend at
the centre spot scrum. A maul
developed just inside the Cardiff
half at which they infringed
allowing the referee to award us a
penalty and a chance to snatch
victory. This we did and gratefully
accepted the cup for the third time
in a row, which will now remain at
St Mary's for good.
After such an excellent team
performance it seems cruel to single
out any players, but I would like to
mention two. Firstly Jon Walters,
who in my opinion was the player
of the tournament; his strong
running, particularly from
defensive positions, led to
numerous tries and gave the rest of
us the chance for a quick breather.
Secondly Stewart Berry, who
started the day being dragged off the
replacement bench at 7.15 that
morning and finished it by kicking
a 40 yard penalty into the wind to
win the tournament. It showed that
to enter any rugby match or
tournament without a kicker is mere
suicide.
The B team also played extremely
well, and after a shakey start went
on to lose in the semi-final of the
bowl competition to the eventual
winners, Newcastle. M y
congratulations to them. Finally my
thanks to the Medical Sickness
Society for once again organising an
excellent tournament, and we look
forward to defending our title next
year.
