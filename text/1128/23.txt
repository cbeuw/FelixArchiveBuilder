Out of Sight * • * * *
Starring : George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Ving Rhames
Director: Steven Soderbergh
T
his film contains what has to be
the best death scene I have ever
witnessed. It's based on the book
by Elmore Leonard - the same guy that
wrote Jackie Brown - with a script from
Scott Frank, who also adapted
Leonard's novel Get Shorty into the film
of the same name. This is quite similar
to Jackie Brown but much better.
Tarantino now has competition.
George Clooney is Jack Foley, a
career struck bank robber who has had
three previous convictions. Karen Sisco
(Jennifer Lopez) almost foiled his jail-
break by being at the wrong place at the
wrong time wearing the wrong clothes.
Although Sisco is a federal Marshall, she
can't resist Foley's charms. It could be a
match made in heaven if It was under dif-
ferent circumstances; but it's not.
This film is movie entertainment at
its best as it contains all the elements
necessary to make it a success. The only
thing against this flick Is that at times the
jumps from past to present aren't always
that clear. The jokes flow in abundance
and are always well timed. Admittedly
there is some violence, but most of it is
timed lo be funny. Most importantly,
Just your average pair of management consultants.
every actor delivers a vivid performances.
Clooney and Lopez interact well as
a good acting partnership should, but
more importantly, they conjure up that
all too rare commodity - sexual chem-
istry, which is portrayed fantastically, with
real passion etched into the screen every
time Lopez and Clooncy appear. As well
as perfect leading characters there is
also a colourful supporting cast. More-
over, what Tarantino-esque film would be
complete without an appearance from
Samuel L Jackson?
When Clooney first appears you
think it's that guy off TV, but he fits his
character so well you soon forget. He has
finally left the small screen and this is a
good film with which to make the break.
There is life after ER. •

With Out of Sight, George Clooney finally
seems to have hit the big time, after the
relative flops that were Batman & Robin
and The Peacemaker. And as the review
above shows, this is not only a top per-
formance from Clooney, it's a damn fine
movie all round.
Thanks to the Odeon Kensington,
we have five pairs of tickets to give away.

^UPDATE
Starship Troopers
To say that this film received a mixed
reception would be a massive under-
statement. Never before has a movie
started so many pub arguments.
Troopers is probably supposed to
have some deep meaning, but as far as
I'm concerned its a movie about a
bunch of kids splatting interstellar bugs.
Which would be OK if it wasn't smeared
over with a bizzare message about fas-
cism. Call me stupid, but don't the Nazi
tactics win at the end? Hello, have I
missed something?
However you look at it, it's hardly
Citizen Kane, and although some of
the effects are impressive, the acting,
plot and direction sink into the depths
of hell. So bad it's good? No, far worse.
The Man in the
Iron Mask
Ah, Leonardo DiCaprio. The most suc-
cessful twenty-four year old in the world.
The idol of a million adolescent dreams.
And a big fan of shagging models and
getting pissed with his mates to boot.
Top bloke all round, really.
Anyhow, back lo the film. A top
ensemble cast (Jeremy Irons, Gabriel
Byrne, Gerad Dcpardieu, John
Malkovich) are gathered together to
recreate Dumas' classic novel - and are
utterly wasted in a hideously over-the-
top production. It's impossible to tell
whether you're really supposed to take
any of this seriously, with comedy slow-
motion, a horrid mix of dodgy accents
and a plot that you can see coming
from a million miles away.
Mrs Brown
This week's quality offering is (surprise,
surprise) bankrolled by British IV -
although for a change the BBC, not Film
tour, take the credit. Having bagged an
Oscar nomination forjudi Dench and a
sackful of other awards, this proves
once again that the one thing Britain
leads the world in is costume dtama.
Dench plays Queen Victoria, and
as the film begins she is still in mourn-
ing for her late husband. Into her mis-
ery comes the only person prepared to
take her on - one of her servants, played
quite brilliantly by Billy Connoly. A defi-
nite must see. D
