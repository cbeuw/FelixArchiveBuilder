PAINTINGS BY ARMANDO GARCIA SEIJO
Cable Street Gallery
V
I A
"his selection of fourteen por-
traits represents two years of
Armando Garcia Seijo's life
prompted by his arrival in London
from Seville. Each piece is very
personal; observations of friends
that he has made in England and
the family that he left behind in
Spain. He has tried to express his
knowledge of the subject's per-
sonality through facial expres-
sions and body language, and
has succeeded in giving each
piece a palpable personality. Sim-
ple backgrounds encourage the
viewer to focus on the figures
and, where more than one per-
son appears in the painting, Seijo
likes thc observer to create their
own narrative describing the sig-
nificance of that moment.
All the exhibits are up for sale
and it seemed strange to me that
Seijo could part with these mem-
ories of people who are obvi-
ously so dear to him. However, as
he pointed out to me, he is only
selling thc pictures and not the
relationships he has with these
individuals. I suppose he can
always buy a photo album.
The exhibition fea-
tures a variety of distinc-
tive people tanging from
a Burger King worker (pic-
tured right) to identical
brothers. In the faces of
The Twins, Seijo has
the ability to articulate
temperament with his
painting. The Family was
painted at a time when
he was missing his rela-
tions in Seville. The impos-
ing woman with a solemn
reproduced an exact like-
ness but in everything
else these men appear
different, and you can-
not help but ptesume
this to be an implication
of theit chatactcrs.
In this exhibition,
Seijo proves that he has
both mother and head of
the family, so not surpris-
ingly occupies the central
position within the group
of five. One of the more
noticeable pieces is SelF-
Portrait as a Dead Man.
The detail of this study
shows the care and attention that
Armando Seijo places in his work,
although you are left wondering
about the motives for such a topic.
This exhibition occupies one
of two rooms in the Cable Street
Gallery and ptovides a stark con-
trast to the abstract work of Dun-
can Pickstock next door.
Pickstock's work (pictured centre)
makes for a very stylish exhibition
although on its own it would lack
the intetest genetated by the dis-
parity between the two collec-
tions.
The studio complex is run for
art promotion and not for profit
and as a consequence it's free. So,
if you happen to be on that side
of town, I tecommend you drop in
for a look around. En definitiva,
merece la pena.

W
hen you think of the Carpen-
tets, what comes to mind? 'Call-
ing Occupants of Interplanetary
craft'? 'Close to You'? Their legacy of light
squeeky clean music brings back images
of mid-seventies pop. They were the
classic 'Bland Band', representing middle
American wholesomeness and family
values - a brother and sister combo
churning out adult nursery rhymes for the
generation that taste forgot. Yesterday
Once More draws back the curtain to
reveal their other side - the power strug-
gles, drug addiction and despair behind
the pure white smiles.
Karen Carpenter died fifteen years
ago of anorexia. She weighed only sev-
enty-eight pounds. The play is her story
- the story of how her perfectionist
brother, domineering mother and her
own self-hate led to her illness and death.
Laurence Bouvard plays a strong, out-
wardly happy Karen wracked by self-
doubt and insecurity. She is ably
supported by a cast who are convincingly
American (except when they're not sup-
posed to be) and convincingly seven-
ties.
Stage docu-dramas often drop in
too many facts at the expense of per-
formancc and natural dialogue. Not thc
case here; the action is related in flash-
back during one of Karen's psychiatric
consultations. Despite jumping between
the present (1982) and various points in
the past, thc narrative line is never lost.
The billing is for a 'play with music'; this
is provided by two slinky black-clad divas
with a backing of electric piano. They fill
gaps between scenes harmoniously with
medleys of Carpenters' hits, which fit
the mood of thc play perfectly at that
point.
It's a sctious play about a tragic
death yet there is still room for some
humour to lighten thc tone. One of
Richatd Catpenter's girlfriends has the
implausible name 'Randy Bash'. Claudia
Garison, as the austere mother Agnes
Carpenter, plays the morally upright indig-
nant puritan to a T . The serious parts are
a sensitive study of the pressures of a
career in the music business when mixed
with those of a stifling family devoid of
compassion. One theory as to the cause
of Karen's anorexia was that she felt that
all she could control was her weight - her
brother wrote the songs, her mother did
the books, all she did was sing. She
became addicted to laxatives and
obsessed with her weight. She slipped
inexorably down the slope to tuin
because her family could not face up to
her problem. It's tear-jerking stuff. The
production made me feel like reading up
more about the Carpenters as well as
reminding me of their happy but haunt-
ing melodies.
This was my first visit to the Man in
the Moon as a theatregoer. In all my pre-
vious visits to this Chelsea watering hole
I had never suspected it concealed a
hotbed of thesbian activity, and how
pleased I was to discover that it did. Just
beside the gents, a door leads to some
stairs which led to an auditotium which
some would desctibc as cramped but
which I thought was intimate. One is
almost on top of thc actors, which can
only make the performance more pow-
erful. Besides, where else but in atheatte
behind a pub is one positively encour-
aged to take drinks into thc auditorium?
