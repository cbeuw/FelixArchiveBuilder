ICSM 4-2 ICLMS
Imperial Medics beat UCLMS to go top of
their BUSA Merit League and remain the
only unbeaten team. ICSM got off to a
brilliant start when some clever interplay
between the midficld and attack put
Ned Carabine in behind the UCLMS
defence. He cooly finished to put ICSM
1
-
0 up after only a few minutes when
the goalkeeper was pressurised into
dropping thc ball which fell at the feet
of captain Johnathan Kennedy who was
left the simpie task of tapping home.
UCLMS responded by upping their game
and got one back when a clumsy tackle
by an ICSM defender resulted in a
penalty. They then equalised just before
half time to make the score 2-2.
ICSM were put under pressure in
the second half and it took some brilliant
saves from goalie "Lucky" Pierre Nasr to
keep the scores level. Increased pos-
session resulted in a third goal for ICSM
as a loose ball in the box was scrambled
home. The game was over when cen-
ttc back James Noblet tutned on a six-
pence from a corner and slotted home
from close range to wtap it up. The final
score of 4-2 was well deserved by ICSM
ICSM 2 - 1 UCL II
ICSM kept the same team lhat beat
UCLMS and went on to beat UCL lis.
ICSM took the initiative and had a lot of
early pressure. A well flighted corner
from Ned Carabine was headed in by the
impressive Chris Hood to put the medics
1-0 up. I lood then "scored" the goal of
the season as a ball from Kennedy was
laid off perfectly by one of the fronl
men. The ball struck thc ctossbar and
appeared to bounce behind the goal
line before bouncing out. In the absence
of a Russian linesman, the goal was dis-
allowed.
The ICSM midfield battled well and
the defence was sturdy. It was breached
only once, during the second half, when
UCL scored 10 minutes from the end to
bring the scores level.
Things then got worse for ICSM as
they lost an injured player and went
down lo ten men. Despite this, they
showed tremendous character and
scored a well-deserved winner two min-
utes from the end as tammon Rabie
slid in as a whipped in cross caused con-
fusion in the UCL defence.
