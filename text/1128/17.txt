Label Profile - East Side Jamz Records
A prominent name in the drum'n'bass
arena nowadays is the label Eastsidc
Jamz. Founded by DJ and producer A-
Sides, Eastside has quickly built up a very
talented roster of young and established
artists. Now the new album, celebrating
the "best" of the label, is out and is an
awesome demonstration of what these
guys ate capable of! All the tracks on this
album are new and exclusive, so it is
more than just a recycled compilation of
old tracks. A-Sides recently came In to
record a mix and interview for the Elec-
tric Cafe.
What do you in terms of music?
I've been producing drum'n'bass for
nearly ten years now. I run two record
made happy hardcore, techno stuff. I'd
like to spend some time trying other
types of music, but I just don't have the
time. But now I am diversifying. I do the
Cyclone projects which are still
drum'n'bass but more on the jazz side.
I'm also getting into working with live
musicians.
Of all the different types of elec-
tronic music, what Is It about drum'n'bass
that particularly grabs you?
I'm into my basslines, I like the tech-
nicality of it, and also what you can do
with the sounds these days. That's more
of a technology thing but I am a tech-
nology freak. I like my buttons and sam-
plers. I like to push the machines as far
labels, one of them's called Eastside
Records, the other one is called Fuse.
They've been up and running for about
two years. We've done twenty two
releases on Eastside and we're upto our
fifteenth release on Fuse.
How did you get Into music?
I used to play the drums at school. I
would put music through my head-
phones and then bang away! It all really
evolved from there.
i was just sodding around in stu-
dios. I actually got a job on the YTS work-
ing with my uncle who is actually a
reggae artist on Zion Train. He taught me
the ropes and got me introduced to the
equipment.
My recording techniques evolved
fromthose of early hip-hop music. You
would make records using a set of decks
and looping the beats backwards and for-
wards and then just layering bits and
peices over the top. From there I got into
drum programming, started sampling
and then moved on to a computer.
Did you always make drum'n'bass?
In terms of how the music has
evolved, yes! Because drum'n'bass was-
n't always drum'n'bass. In the early days
it was hardcore. Drum'n'bass now is a
progression of the music that was. I've
as I can. Drum'n'bass is demanding. It
demands a lot out of the equipment
you've got. It is a music that is forever
changing and pushing forward. It has
never been stuck in a rut.
Drum'n'bass has really made it Into
the spotlight recently. Many journalists
seem to be poised and waiting for it to
burn Itself out. What do you attribute to
Its continued success?
People like Roni Size give a good
image. I've got a lot of respect fro them
because they've done It the right way.
They're still there, doing their own thing.
Their music was good to start off with,
but they've been really well packaged.
They've got al the right people behind
them. Certain people have gone through
but then you don't hear anything from
them again. Alex Reece! What's hap-
pened to him? After a few top 40 hits
he's disappeared. DJ Crystal is another
prime example. He was really good in his
day, got lied up to a major label and
nothing!
How do you DJ?
I like to play right the way across the
board. I'm playing quite hard these days
because it's difficult to find some good
jump up stuff that I like! I switch from one
genre to another and you'll hear all dif-
ferent styles, i don't care what the style
is as long as the beat is good!
Do you play regularly?
Yes! I've done a lot of work overseas.
I've played three times in New Zealand.
I toured the States this year, from Boston
to Nashville - the home of country and
western! I'm taking a break for a while,
but I'll be picking up the DJing again
soon.
What Is the difference between your
two labels, Eastside and Fuse?
I use is more hard and experimental;
it's more dark and deep. Eastside is more
rolling and good time music.
Eastside Is two years old. Was the
album put together to celebrate the
label's birthday?
No. It is like a stepping-stone for us;
a progression. Youcan only put out so
mant twelve inches in a year. It's also so
that people start to take us a bit more
seriously, so it's good for our profile. It
gets our music to new audiences that we
couldn't normally reach. Because of the
CD, we'll inevitably hit another market.
Everything on the album is new and
exclusive. It will not be coming out in any
other form. We're also expecting to do
a similar album for Fuse Recordings.
Have the artists grown with the
label?
Certain ones have. I'm all about
pushing them anyway. Some only have
a basic studiosetup, so I say, "Look. Come
to my place." So I sit with them and work
together with them. I'm always pushing
them. I'm bringing them new technology
so they can make their music better. My
studio is a base and is open to all my
artists. That in itself should push them fur-
ther, because they will be able to get a
better sound.
Is there a certain sound or vibe asso-
ciated with the label?
Yes. I think the artists know what I
like. I do have the final say about what
goes where. I won't write the tracks for
them, but I can help them fine-tune a
track in my studio.
What advice do you have for people
wanting to get Into music?
Go out and buy your own studio! No
seriously, do it all off your own back if
you can. tt depends on how much
money you've got, but technology
comes cheap if you look carefully. I
would say get a little setup at home so
you can do your own thing and work on
your own sound. Just send out demos to
people!
Many thanks to A-Sides and every-
one at Eastside jamz and Main Source.
