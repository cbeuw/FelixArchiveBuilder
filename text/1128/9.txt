Medicine Matters
P
olitics is a strange concept and one
which I am not sure that I can ade-
quately define. It docs not make
money (not legally anyway), it rarely
relieves human suffering and indeed is
very often a major contributing factor.
You cannot eat politics, drink politics or
breathe politics and yet people do and
thrive. Politics seems to make the world
go around by some strange application
of forces that even the brightest theo-
retical mathematician at IC would be
hard pressed to explain.
Everybody decries politicians; they
are a hated, despised group. People with
political ambition are considered untrust-
worthy, somehow unfit for a real job
and rank with footballers and models as
being top of the fair game list for tabloid
papers. This being the case it seems
strange that there are so many politi-
cians around with their
numbers, it seems, grow-
ing daily.
Nowhere can this phenomenon be
seen more clearly than in the student
activities of Imperial College. Apathy rules
supreme, we are told, with one sabbat-
ical position left unfilled, yet the other
extreme can be seen in the vehemence
with which people debate the presence
of medics at IC in Felix. Anyone judging
the level of political awareness by read-
ing the letters page recently would be
forgiven for awaiting the news of recent
assassinations, as tempers seem to be
running so high. How is such fervour and
passion possible with such apathy?
This politics is not limited to an inter-
departmental level. Within the medical
school itself politics is rife. Not even I am
insensitive enough to risk quoting exam-
ples of back-stabbing
Nick Newton within the school because
finally things are starting
to settle down, but I think that it is a
shame that people are put off attempt-
ing to do jobs which they are eminently
suitable for because of the politics of the
club or society.
So, if clubs and societies are not
forums for politics why do they have
elections, what are the officers for and
why do we have an elected union? Every-
body who is at medical school is a mem-
ber of the student union unless you
specifically choose not to be and the
elected officers are there to serve you the
members of that union, not themselves.
The captains of the sports' clubs run the
clubs supported by anyone else the clubs
care to elect. Similarly presidents of soci-
eties run these societies aided by other
people. So Wade runs the student union
for the good of the students and is
assisted in this by the other elected offi-
cers. It is not a secretive boys club for
elected members only, it is set up to
help do things for the students be it
organise bops, represent them when
they are in trouble or anything else that
students want.
Whenever a student, be they at
South Kensington, St. Mary's, Charing
Cross, Hammersmith, Silwood Park or
any other site of Imperial College says
that they do know what the SU do or why
they exist it is a personal indictment of
every elected member of the union for
either not doing your job or not telling
people what you can do for them. The
student unions should be about service,
not self-service.

ing', and not everybody can do it. In
these kind of dreams the world is yours
for the taking. You can do absolutely
anything you like, once you realise you're
actually dreaming. I used to visualise a
door before me, and then when I
opened it, anything I wanted, person,
place or thing, would be on the other
side. There are endless possibilities, lim-
ited only by your imagination. The only
downside is that this period of lucid
dreaming only usually lasts for a short
while. So you could wake up at a cru-
cial moment, feeling really frustrated!
Most people will have at least one lucid
dream experience during their lifetime
but about 20% of the population arc
regular lucid-dreamers having them at
least once a month.
The importance of dreams was
recognised centuries ago. In ancient
Egypt around 2000 BC, dream temples
were built especially for priests to inter-
pret the dreams of others. It was Sig-
mund Freud however who began the
work of understanding dreams in the
modern era. Freud believed that dreams
were manifestations of our deepest,
often sexual desires, kept hidden from
our waking minds. Carl Jung, another
famous psychologist disagreed with
Freud by arguing that dreams were vital
messages designed to be listened to -
not hidden away. He was convinced
that dreams help to reveal to our wak-
ing minds many of our deepest wishes,
and by doing so, help us to fulfil our
ambitions. Many dream consultants
believe that our dreams provide impor-
tant avenues through which our psyche
or subconscious can speak to us. They
say that dreams are another dimension
of ourselves, available only to the
dreamer. Flere are a few examples of
dream interpretations:
Presidential Talk-Back
- Climbing dreams (such as mine)
symbolise ambition.
- Dreams that involve the shedding
of blood are actually positive, symbolis-
ing the completion of an ordeal or sac-
rifice and the beginning of the healing
process.
- Dreams of being naked have noth-
ing to do with sex. They suggest vul-
nerability or emotional exposure.
- Falling off a cliff or from a height
points to a feeling of powerlessness.
- Erotic dreams involving celebrities
and film stars arc harmless and simply
indicate a need for excitement, so relax,
make the most of them and enjoy!
Many great scientific and techno-
logical inventions throughout history
came as a result of dreams, pointing to
their 'problem-solving' nature. Kckulc,
the famous chemist, whilst trying to fig-
ure out the structure of benzene, fell
asleep. He had a dream about snakes,
suddenly one of the snakes curled
around and seized its tail. He awoke and
realised that the carbon atoms in ben-
zene formed a ring structure.
The best ways to remember and
understand your dreams is to keep a
dream diary. As soon as you wake up,
write down everything you remember
including your feelings, however jum-
bled up it may seem at the time. It's also
a good idea to note down the previous
day's events. In the words of Freud,
dreams are the 'royal roads to the mind1
.
In taking time out to discover what your
dreams represent, you may understand
more about yourself.
So relax and enjoy the fascinating
adventures created by your inner con-
science!
T
he bulk of
my time this David Hellard
week has
been spent in a confer- |
ence called STADIA (stu- J
dent training and
development in action). I

University of I ondon is
failing massively. Your §8
counterparts throughout
the country have access
to training in what employ-
ees view as the 'key skills'
that students require above a degree
to be successful in their job; we cur-
rently do nothing. Ideally by the end
of my term I would like to have set up
an equivalent, allowing students to
train in a variety of subjects from pre-
sentation skills to IT.
During my time there I also
learned a lot about how to set up a
'jobshop' and the different permuta-
tions that one might have. The idea of
this is to provide our students with a
safe place to find any part-time work
that they desire and possibly holiday
work with major companies who they
might want to work for in the future.
If by the end of this year I haven't set
a budget and received at least half of
the sponsorship money to set it up for
next summer, give me a kicking.
The Jobshop will be in the west
wing basement of Beit Quad and is
just one of the many projects that we
arc planning, but as with many deci-
sions we make, we work on the
assumption that we know what stu-
dents want. Are we right though? If
you feel that the
ICU President Union is not offer-
ing a service that
:: it should tell us what you
int. We are currently
• planning for next year and
I we need to know (presi-

I know that the issue
- of Ihe Medical Union will
inevitably come up in this
issue. I he school of med-

and the scuffles in the
Medical executive may be having an
adverse effect on these clubs, but this
can be avoided. For years the clubs
have relied on their exec for help and
advice and have proven to be very
successful, but their insistence on only
using the medics for these purposes
have put them at a disadvantage. In
the Union we have permanent staff
who can help everyone with their
sports fixtures, the running of events
and everything you need to know
about financial difficulties that you
might face. The sabbaticals are also
here to work for you, being the most
able to advise you on the Union pol-
icy and regulations that you will have
to follow. If you need help or are
unsure please come and see us, we
are more than willing to help, after all
we work for you.
There have been some replies
about the opening times of the Health
Centre, not enough though. If you do
want it to be open at lunchtimes,
please email mc.
