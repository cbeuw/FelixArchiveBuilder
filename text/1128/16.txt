Artist Profile - Hardfloor
Hardfloor have made a name forthem-
selves as one of the outfits that took add
music and really evolved and experi-
mented with it. As their music became
more famous and filled up dancefloors
the world over, so too did the demands
for the remixing skills. They have even
moved into the field of remixing big
names such as Depechc Mode, New
Order and Mori kante. Hardfloor are
Oliver Bondzioand Ramon Zenker from
Dusseldorf in Germany. In a recent inter-
view, Richie haetin credited them with
being instrumental in taking acid techno
and being on the forefront of its devel-
opement.
To be quite honest, I was nervous
about this interview beforehand. Hard-
floor have achieved so much commercial
success that i wasn't sure what I would
encounter. Most of my guests have
come from and stayed in the under-
ground. I met Oliver, and was instantly
reassured. None of the attitude, just a
really down-to-earth and friendly guy
with a big sense of humour to boot!
Here's the interview...
Explain Hardfloor.
We started the Hardfloor back in
1991. We have had four albums so far,
and in between the albums something
like twelve singles, we also did a lot of
remixes for well-known people like
Depechc Mode, Mike Oldficld, Thc
Shamen, etc.
When you DJ, what Is your style?
I stsrted up (the mix for the radio
show) with strange stuff like Cristian
Vogel, Neil Landstrumm and some tracks
off my own new label, serial Killers Hair-
cut. After that I played some acid tracks
from our new album, then some straight
techno tracks. I'm also into house music.
I can play instrumental, deep, jazzy stuff.
I have a new house label called Gen-
tleman's Haircut!
How did you come to discover elec-
tronic music?
I was interested in groups like
Kraftwerk back in the 1970's, but I never
thought of producing stuff because it
was too complex for mc. They had big
studios and expensive synthesizers. The
first samplers were so expensive!
I started DJing with hip-hop back in
1983. I was on the breakdance scene
with scratching and all that. In 1986/7 I
heard my first acid house records. That
made me think of producing my own
records because it sounded so cheap, yet
powerful. I only needed a drum machine
and a 303, which I could afford. Then I
could make a track!
Did you make music before Hard-
floor?
No. Hardfloor was my first produc-
tion projed. My partner Ramon did some
stuff before, so when I met him, I knew
he had a studio. I asked him.if we could
do some tracks together. He was into it,
so I played some old school acid tracks
to him and that was the beginning.
Working as a group, does he still
have all the technical Input?
No. Now we have three big studios.
One is in my apartment where I can
make tracks on my own. But we also
have a studio for Hardfloor where we can
produce tracks together.
We have a really good flow together,
most of the time I tell ramon what I want
and then he does it for me. We still work
in the same way because he's the best
on the computer.
This Is your fourth album (All Targets
Down). Most eledronic artists don't
choose to express themselves on a full-
length format. Why do you do this?
When wc started I was toatally into
the underground scene. I never thought
about doing a whole album. I just
wanted to do some tracks. We then
hooked up with Sven Vath for harthouse
and then tye Q. They told us that they
wanted to work with artists for a longer
time. They saw some potential in our
work, so instead of just doing one ortwo
cps they asked us to do an album.
We don't build albums around a con-
cept, we put eight tracks together and
call it an album. Ramon and I both have
lots of other projects on the side so we
made Hardfloor into a 303 band.
I've noticed that some Hrdfloor
tracks are more downbeat and slower in
style. Does this come from your hip-hop
roots?
Yes definitely. I'm really into hip-hop;
originally I was a b-boy! I still love hip-hop
and I'm thinking of doing an album with
some east coast rappers. I want to do the
beats. We have lots of talented scratch
DJs in Dusseldorf.
Hardfloor was influenced by many
different styles of music, but we always
try to add the Hardfloor style at the end
of a track.
Do you still DJ the hip-hop stuff?
No. yo be honest i don't like the
scene. Hip-hop clubs aren't really about
partying, but just being cool. There's too
much crime in the German hip-hop
clubs. I prefer the peaceful, friendly feel-
ing at hose parties and techno raves, foe
me hip-hop is the sound that I listen to.
Hardfloor have remixed some big
name bands. Did you find that when
the band had a big company behind
them, there was more pressure on you
to produce the goods?
we started remixing underground
artists. Then some major companies
called us and asked us ifwe wanted to
remix their artists with the typical Hard-
floor big buildup style, but still incorpo-
rating poppy vocals. It was quite a new
experience for us so we tried and it did
well.
We didn't really feel pressure, the
first remixes we id were from our minds
and free ideas. The next mixes the com-
panies asked for had to be the same
style. They wanted everything done in
the same way so we copied ourselves
and we tried to put our new and best
ideas into our own productions and not
thc remix work. Every hardfloor remix
sounds thesame but a lot of people liked
them so I think it's till OK.
You said you wanted to do live sets
as hardfloor. this is something that still
hasn't been fully accepted into techno
music. How do you approach the live
concept?
it's just two of us playing, thereis no
interesting show or anything! It's 100%
live so we don't use DAT or anything. We
have a mixing desk, effects, drum
machines, midi file player - we just play
the music!
Most people criticise live electronic-
music, but we've played around the
world and we're really happy with the
reaction from the people. We didn't form
Hardfloor to tout worldwide, but people
ask us to play live. After the show they
really appreciate what we did.
We sometimes think it must be really
boring but some of the people will watch
how we use the equipment, and the
others are just dancing. They don't care
if a DJ is piaying or if the music is com-
ing from a live act.
Do you play new songs or improvise
when you do a live set?
We don't freestyle on stage. We have
a strict setup. We play tracks from all
four albums,- slow and fast tracks.
Nobody is bored. That's the main thing.
Never change a winning team!
What's your advice to people who
want make music their life?
Never start withthe opinion, "I want
to make commercial music, and I want
to make lots of money." That's not true
to the game.
You can get the new Hardfloor
album, All Targets Down. It's out now on
Harthousc Records. We're giving away
copies on the next page.
If you're a DJ check out those two
new record labels, Seial Killer's Haircut
(twisted techno) and Gentleman's Hair-
cut (Jazzy house). alick
