You've heard their show - now find out what Sandide & Desire are all about
What do you do at IC Radio?
S: As well as our weekly hard house/hardcore show, we
both Dj at 'The Backroom' Friday nights. We also both
do external events through the radio.
What's your favourite track of the year so far ?
S: 'The Dawn' by Tony de Vit. This tunc summarised
Tony's career as a DJ and a producer in an exceptional
manner, and he'll always be remembered by this song.
D: 'Timebomb' by Jon Doe and Lisa A is an excellent
tune.
Which way Is music going ?
S & D: Harder, faster and more intense.
Which Is your favourite record shop ?
S: In London, I think that Ambient Soho has some excel-
lent material.
D: It's got to be Elite Records in Victoria.
How much would it cost to hire you out ?
S: For what ? I
D: It depends upon the venue I'm playing at really.
Do you have a favourite DJ ?
S: Carl Cox. He's talented and he has managed to
stand the test of time.
D: I've got a lot of respect for a large number of DJ's,
who include Seduction, Sy, Hixxy and Force & Styles.
How long have you been djlng ?
S & D: About four years, and just over a year on IC Radio.
Have you any favourite shows on IC Radio ?
S: I love 'Knickers & Pants', it's quality. Check it out.
D: Last year I thought Jon & All's show, 'Vinyl Frontier'
was wicked.
How do you think the Back Room is this year ?
S: It's going from strength to strength. We have excel-
lent quality resident DJ's on Thursdays playing some
quality cuts and the guest DJ's on Fridays are doing a
marvellous job of things.
D: It's far more professional now, and much better
organised.
Have you ever had a bad experience djing ?
D: One night in dB's a UV light exploded and showered
the stage with glass. It was lucky no-one was on the
stage at the time.
And the funny times ?
S: Again, I was once playing in dB's on a Hedonizm night
playing quite a fast set when, to my amazement, the
warden of my halls of residence was giving it all he had
on the dancefloor.
D: We once played a night in a hall bar, we played to
a packed house until we were thrown out at around
12am because neighbours were complaining. They
wouldn't have been if they'd have been there, though!
What frustrates you the most?
S: That no-one knows where 'The Backroom' is! It's not
hard to find - at the far end of Southside Bar by the toi-
lets.
Who is there to look out for on the scene ?
S: Check out Alick from the Electric Cafe, another Back-
room resident. Also watch out for the men like DJ
Desire, you know what I'm saying.
D: DJ Storm on the hardcore scene is doing very well
at the moment.
Finally, what are your plans for the future ?
S: I want to push the BackRoom further, make it recog-
nised as the number one place to chill out.
D: We'll be definitely be playing out more across Lon-
don and trying our hand at production with our new
label which is coming out sometime in early 1999.
