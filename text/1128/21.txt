LOUISE BOURGEOIS: RECENT WORK
Serpentine Gallery, Hyde Park
S
urgeon General's warning: if you
suffer from arachnophobia, con-
sult your physician before going to
this exhibition. Then ignore their advice
and go anyway because the experience
is worth any number of panic attacks.
There are, in fact, only two spider sculp-
tures, but they are sufficiently compelling
to frighten even the cynics. At first you
see a giant spider towering over a mas-
sive cage. Looking closer, the cage door
is slightly ajar, inviting the unwary viewer
to sit on a worn but comfortable chair...
Will the spider gobble them up? The
artist, Louise Bourgeois considers the
spider to be a mother-figure; to me, the
whole installation just seemed sinister.
But Bourgeois loves people to interpret
her art in their own way, after all "the
meaning is not a mystery- the mystery
resides in what you do with it."
The idea of spider as mother is just
one of the many bizarre yet original
thoughts of Louise Bourgeois. Who could
argue with her assertion that "pain is
the ransom of formalism"? Bourgeois is
undeniably one of the giants of 20th
Century art. Indeed, if experience mat-
ters, Bourgeois certainly has it in buck-
etfuls, because at age 87 she has lived
through most of the major art move-
ments of the century. Bourgeois began
personal demons clearly informs her
work. Her art has always tackled femi-
nism and the taboos of sex and death,
but more so now than ever. Recent work
is highly cathartic: this is almost a last tes-
tament as she incorporates much of her
emotional and physical (old clothes,
knick-knacks) baggage into the sculp-
tures.
as a Maths student at the Sorbonne, but
by 1 935 she had committed herself to a
career In art. Three years later she emi-
grated to New York City and started
sculpting.
Little Louise, her feminist mother,
the abusive husband and his ever-pre-
sent mistress. Bourgeois is still haunted
by this terrifying and confused childhood
and the act of coming to terms with her
Most striking arc the decapitated tor-
sos suspended from gibbets. Some
appear as ghosts and others almost as
hanged men. They all have an undeni-
able eroticism (Bourgeois is known for
this) but they also have an eerie quality:
maybe they will come alive and grab
you without warning. It's all very spooky,
so make sure you leave before it gets
dark.
This one really sticks in my mind: a
room, loosely enclosed by fragile walls
and inside, a torso slumped on a chair,
lo survey the scene you must peek
through cracks in the walls,- you can
never gain a complete view. I felt as if I
had stumbled upon a massacre. Imagine
finding a deserted cottage and catching
glimpses of a corpse through the open
window,- silence but for the buzzing of
flics and the flapping of sheets on a
washing line. Is this Bosnia or Kosovo on
the Nine O'clock News? No: this emo-
tional war zone is only 10 minutes walk
from College.

INTO THE WOODS
Donmar warehouse
O
nce upon a time... This is one of
Stephen Sondheim's most pop-
ular and critically acclaimed
musicals. It was written and staged for
the first time in 1987. Over the past
twenty-five years, Sondheim has created
some of the most inventive and appre-
ciated musical theatre: highlights of his
career include A little night music, Com-
pany and Passion, all recently staged in
London with phenomenal success.
Into the Woods is a brilliant recre-
ation of childrens' fairytales. It combines
Cinderella, Jack and his beanstalk, Little
Red Riding Hood, the Baker and his Wife
with of course a very nasty witch. All the
characters play a particular role in the
plot, but in this particular musical, their
lives are linked by the woods. Sondheim
lets his story unfold, as if the show was
aimed at a very young audience, so at
the end of the first part there seems to
be no more to say. However, this is
where Sondheim's
art comes into its
own. In the sec-
ond half, things
start getting a lit-
tle cruel; all the
characters search
for a way to kill the
giant's wife who
has been destroy-
ing their houses.
Eventually all ends
just about well;
the giant dies but
so docs most of
the little crowd.
As always,
Sondheim displays
a magical touch
with the music
and lyrics, at the same time keeping a
very rough edge, often reflecting upon
human behaviour and relationships.
Despite appear-
ances, this show is
definitely not for
children because
of its content. The
music is lovely, the
lyrics are very
funny and well
written, typical
strengths in Sond-
heim's theatre.
The singing is
adequate, certainly
not brilliant, but
then this is not a
musical in the
strictest sense - the
composer isn't
writing for singers
that can act but
instead for actors who can just about
sing. Although the quality of the singing
is lost, wc get some amazing perfor-
mances in return especially from Sophie
Thompson as the Baker's wife. Sheridan
Smith makes a very cheeky and cute Lit-
tle Red Riding Hood and Clare Burt is the
sexiest witch this side of fairytale land.
This show is pure bliss, much better
than all the West End musicals put
together. You will laugh endlessly and if
you go there with a child's eyes, you will
be charmed by the incredible magic on
stage. This is theatre that everyone can
enjoy and I can only encourage you
warmly to find out for yourselves
