A dazzling variety performance, 'Incarnations of Light' was billed as an infusion of cultures.

'East meets West' was truly an under-
statement, as Eastern mystique collided
head on with Western youth culture
resulting in a cataclysmic feast of music,
fashion and inspired drama. Despite an
hour long delay in starting, the awe-
some explosions that heralded the open-
ing act set in motion a wave of
irrepressible excitement that swept over
all occupants of thc Great
Hall throughout last
Monday evening. As
Ihe event w a s .
coordinated by j
the Indian Society,
the emphasis was j
understandably
placed on Orien-
tal themes. How-
ever this biased |
tone left the non-
Asian minority I
slightly bewildered
by subtle refer-
ences and jokes.
With all pro-
ceeds going to
charity (thc money'
raised is being shared between |
the British Heart foundation5
and the Pulse Appeal), the)
organisers set out to create a 'successful
and entertaining show... serving only to
highlight the positive in both cultures
and Ideologies', from the outset, the
acts attempted to portray a vibrant con-
temporary image. Throughout the
evening, they illustrated the persona of
ion, but utilised numerous innovative
vehicles to present a spectrum of style
which ranged from traditional Asian dress
to the urban street styles paraded by the
feisty models. The audi-
| ence was treated to a
I show of pouts, sultry
stares and exhibitionist
' poses, as they strutted their
stuff on thc podium. The pre-
sentation of a wide array of
I colourful garments was one of
s !
the major themes of the show
|with numerous catwalk ses-
1 sions punctuating Ihe
I evening. The clothes, pro-
I vided by Ciro Citterio. were
often complemented by the
wearer's demeanor, the sultry
I iridescence of the 'Salmaan's
i suit' as he rolled out the slick
w vocals of 'One for the Money'
being a case in point. Alto-
gether, thc confident anci
vibrant routines sparkled with a
i professional finish.
The careful choreography
I of many of the dances was
I certainly evident from the
\ intense concentration on the
faces of many routines' expo-
nents. This helped the audience appre-
ciate the effort that had gone into
preparation. As the evening proceeded
the individual flair of many cast members
shone through. Most performances were
extremely energetic, some even includ-
ing elements of breakdown acrobatics

what was perceived to be the new British-
Asian generation as being proud of their
tradition, with the insight and person-
ability to comfortably find a place in a
constantly changing society.
The event was heavily based on fash-
and gymnastics (thumbs up to the girl
who managed a cartwheel in a sari!).
lor the most part, the comedy
sketches heightened the show's appeal,
although some pieces lacked essential
pace and direction. The pseudo-pan-
tomime 'Surinderalla' for instance was a
soundly written showpiece, which poked
fun at the various controversies within
and surrounding the Asian college com-
munity. The writers made use of sexual
innuendo with reckless abandon, not
only to guarantee laughs, but also to
highlight the pros and cons of issues
such as arranged marriages and early
taken to indulging his exuberant
charisma, which soon led to verbal bat-
tles between himself and the crowd.
This banter added a unique, sometimes
uncomfortable, but often dynamic aspect
to the night. As the atmosphere intensi-
fied, a showdown occurred with a puerile
spectator brandishing a laser pointet on
the sly.
The organisers receive their hard earned praise
curfews. Bordering on the safe side of
offence, the sketches often made use
of racial stereotypes, and on numer-
ous occasions even weighed in
the current non-med!c/mc
debate. In fact, this was a clever i
of parody, as it was clear ' V
