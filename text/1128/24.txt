TOCA 2 (PSX)
Codemasters
Formula 1 has its F1 '98, so Touring Cars
has its TOCA range. Codemasters,
pleased as punch at having smashed all
the opposition in the rally car racing
game with Colin McRae Rally, has
decided to dig in and produce a better
Touring Car racing game.
If you did want an excellent British
Touring Car game then go and buy it
now. But if it is such an excellent game
then you might well wonder "Why only
4 stars?". OK so the game is good, damn
good with excellent high-resolution
graphics - you can now see into other
cars should you wish to take your eyes
off the road. The action is fluid and the
now expected pop up handled well.
Cars can be driven positively if a little bit
too sensitively from the dual shock com-
patible control method - the first ten or
so laps will be spent attempting to
follow the racing line rather than fish
tail down the long fast corners.
There is even realistic collision dam-
age when the car takes the tight
right hand bend too fast, ending up
against the fence without a front
bumper, tven more scary is when
some adrenaline fuelled boy racer
shunts and destroys half of the rear
of your car just because you
decided to brake for the same tight right
corner on the next lap. If your car comes
in less damaged than old Nige's Fords
then consider it a good race. In fact if you
love British Touring Car you might even
love Top Gear's Tiff whining sarcastically.
This game would have definitely got 5
stars if a game with a very small name
did not already exist. Want to know
which is still the best saloon car racing
game? it's still GT.
If you have not got it by now you
really should just go and buy GT (Gran
Tourismo) and try hard not to get
addicted to the breadth of racing pos-
sibilities. So what if you cant turn a car
over and 300 kph collisions result in
nothing happening to the car - except
perhaps making the car face another
direction. You don't just have a fixed
number of works prepared race cars,
you have the whole of the manufactur-
ers production range. TOCA does what
it says, and does it very well. Unfortu-
nately the saloon car racer has moved
on. Now if only you could start by racing
mini cars round Silverstone and then
move up to thc touring cars using the
same graphics and game play as TOCA
or better, well then you might just be
onto a six out of five.

Apocalypse (PSX)
Activision
Movie tie-ins, TV tie-ins, with tego there
is now even a toy brick tie in, but an actor
tie-in - now that is an original concept.
Activision realising that a third person
shooter needs a bit of an edge, has
decided that by using Bruce Willis as the
hero in this game they have the sharpest
game in thc box. The digitised Bruce
plays Trey Kincaide, humanity's only
hope in a world where science is out-
lawed and Imperial knocked down and
turned into the Diana garden of Peace
and Virtue. Kincaide's tutor has decided
on one last experiment and has sum-
moned the four Horsemen of the Apoc-
alypse in an attempt to inctease his next
grant application. So Btuce, sorry Kin-
caide, has to hunt them
down one by one,
though starting from a
prison cell is not the best
way to go about it.
The Btuce influence
runs deep, with big
weapons, big linear lev-
els and big Bruce voice
overs when you waste a
bad guy or stumble
across another part of
thc story. Thc game does
feel like a movie more
than a game, thc main character seems
to be able to survive almost anything and
the first two end of level guardians can
be despatched easily and quickly just by
simple dodge left then
right moves.
The game itself is
good while never
reaching excellent, the
switching camera
angles are both origi-
nal, and unnecessarily
annoying for the
beginner. Its not all
annoying touches,
there are some blasts
from the past s, the character can fire
in directions other than the one you are
running in. The graphics are moody and
offer up the occasional surprise, such as
the background screens playing thc
video of one of the sound tracks as you
fight your way round the city. The sounds
are loud, and with Bruce quipping every
other minute - very action movie. In fact
project it onto a cinema screen and call
it Die Hard 45 - die good but not dead
good.

No One Can Stop Mr Domino (PSX) Full Time
Every once in a while an odd and origi-
nal game makes it to the levels of game
nirvana. It immediately bonds with the
game-players psyche and sits there look-
ing very smugly down on all of the dri-
ving and combat clones. Wotms and
Lemmings are examples of this strange
occurrence, Domino on the other hand
is just too odd.
Combine the silly circuit elements of
micromachincs, remove any racing com-
ponents and instead allow levels to be
finished when Mr Domino completes all
of the domino tricks on a level; mix in
some very odd Japanese ideas and you
have Mr Domino described totally. Or
perhaps it is not all that simple.
The game ends when you lose all
your lives, which happens when you
cither run out of time, or thc domino
character has been smacked, bumped or
fallen its way to an early return to the big
domino box in the sky. The tricks arc
completed by laying dominos and then
making them fall onto a trick tile on the
floor, so to complete a level requires at
least two circuits of some very odd tracks.
Putting aside the severe oddness of
the game - only achievable under altered
states of mind, the game is mildly amus-
ing if difficult to complete. Thete is a cer-
tain addiction clement as you attempt to
see what thc next trick will achieve. The
first few ate obvious - pool balls falling
into pockets and ball bearings spiralling
down tracks - but after a while the odd-
ness truly takes hold as cereal packets
suddenly go all Munch and start to
become animated "scream" images and
rice starts popping from an overhead
rice popper. Hmmm. There are also
some nice odd touches such as when
the domino charactet picks up a carrier
bag and uses it as a parachute.
In summary, this is odd, very odd.
Either it is being marketed for young
kids, where watching large asexual,
bright coloured, creatures with TV's
where there internal organs should exist
is considered normal. Or it's for thc late
night pub and club, chill out crowd. Its
definitely not for adults in thc cold light
of day.
