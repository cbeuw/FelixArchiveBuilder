Beit Underdevelopment
Y
ou think you've seen it all, and then
they pull another one out of the hat.
The Beit Quad redevelopment is
rapidly turning from an innocuous farce
into a disgrace. For those new to this
parish, the College has been working
out what to do with the space vacated by
Biology and the accommodation part for
ages. There have been so many business
plans produced that, if you had a pound
for every one written, you would just
about cover the hundreds of thousands
wasted on consultants. Just when every-
thing was looking fine and dandy, our
Sherfield brethren have decided that the
Union can't have the space promised
that allowed them to go ahead with the
DBs expansion. There will be many casu-
alties of this volte face, not least Felix, and
that, dear reader, means mc. So why all
the problems? Surely it's just a case of
tarting the place up a bit and converting
Biology, you say. Ah, the innocence of
youth. This is Imperial. We have bigger
ideas. We don't have halls of residence,
we have 'a mix of accommodation
favourable for conference/holiday let-
ting purposes.' Naturally, this costs a lot
more than student dwellings - the latest
plan suggests about £54 per night for a
single room. The costs of the project
mean that we cannot afford to have half
the place empty during the summer - the
latest plan suggests 85% occupancy,
which, according to thc hotel industry,
equates to being fully booked. Starting to
look a bit tight, so maybe we need a few
more rooms. I know, we'll screw the
Union! Those daft sods still think we give
a damn what they think. Perfect!
Why, you may ask, are College hell-
bent on achieving this at seemingly any
cost? Do they really care so passionately
that our boys and girls should be housed
in the lap of luxury. Of course not. It is
no secret that the Rector has a dream of
creating his very own Cambridge-style
quad here in SW7. Give it time and we'll
have Eric Liddell running around thc
place to the accompaniment of Vange-
lis. Not only lhat, but the Beit Quad pro-
ject needs to be completed in time for
the British Association conference at
Imperial in summer 2000. With that
degree of political will, why sully one's
hands with such sordid issues as finan-
cial viability? But it gets worse. The Con-
ference Office is, as a result, moving
mountains to force through this project.
Their success is obviously dependent on
expanding their empire, so they are also
more keen on the approval of thc pro-
ject, rather than the long term financial
position. Flow in God's name could any-
one think that you can fill that many
rooms for that much day in, day out.
Such occupancy levels arc rarely
achieved in Prince's Gardens over the
summer, and if you strip out discounted
rooms to language schools, thc propo-
sition looks
ridiculous.
But, say the
Conference
Office, this accom-
modation is better
quality. I don't
doubt it, but in
spending so much
on the refurbish-
ment (£11 million),
you have eroded
the price advan-
tage that wc had.
Would you really
spend nearly £60
per night to sleep
in a student hall of
residence, when a
half-decent hotel
could be found at
roughly the same
amount?
Now as you
know, I bow
to no one in
my admiration of the Conference Office,
led by thc incomparable Annette De
Lima, a highly professional Individual; I
know the great store in which she holds
professionalism because she told Fe//xso
last year at the time of her attempts to
sue us for defamation. However, I fear
that over-exuberance has clouded their
judgement. This has all thc hallmarks of
a disaster waiting to happen. I under-
stand and applaud College's attempt to
improve its housing stock and commer-
cial activities, but projects dtiven by
hopes and dreams of turning Imperial
into something it is not, or'shouldn't be,
ate not thc way. If thc Rector really wants
to take the bull by the horns, he should
move Sherfield into thc Royal School of
Mines after its redevelopment, stick the
Union in Sherfield and fund the thing by
selling or leasing out Beit Quad. It is not
part of the main campus block and is
worth a fortune. I accept thai Salman
Rushdie has voiced less heretical views
than that, but it's worth considering, solv-
ing a host of problems in one foul
sweep.
Third World First?
fast Thutsday, while taking lunch at the
Savoy Grill, the
Simon Baker
Voice of Reason
subject of
Third World
poverty came
up, which
reminded me of
Jacob Stringer's
promotional piece
for Third World
First. He quotes a
variety of statistics,
suggesting that
debt repayment is
crippling the
healthcare and
education systems
of many African
nations. Many of
his figures are com-
pelling but inaccu-
rate: According to
the World Bank,
tthiopia
spends ten
times more on
education that
he suggests, and actually has a better
pupil/teacher ratio for primary school-
children than South Africa, a country
whose economy is 2200% larger. Not a
perfect situation, but better than he sug-
gests. Tanzania does not spend six times
more on debt repayment than health-
care, the true figure being about 1.5.
Third World debt is not measured in tril-
lions. The total for low income nations
was $318.3 billion in 1996, not pin
money, I agree, but slightly more man-
ageable than Jacob's figure Of more
concern were the numbers he did not
include. For instance, Sudan spends
more than twice as much on defence as
it does on healthcare. Mozambique also
16 November 1998
spends more on defence than health.
Lnough of thc stats. The problem of
wholesale, unconditional debt cancella-
tion is twofold. Firstly, it fails to address
the underlying causes of economic dif-
ficulty. Why should a government get its
house in order, so that it may pay its
debt, rebuild its infrastructure and
improve the lot of its people when those
nice men from the IMF will come along,
wave a magic wand and make it disap-
pear? This is to treat the symptoms rather
than the cause. Secondly, it penalises
those countries which have made the
effort to sort out their debt situation by
taking sensible steps to restore their eco-
nomic infrastructure rather than relied
purely on international charity. Jacob is
also deluding himself that money saved
on debt servicing and repayment would
automatically be switched to health and
education. Debt relief and other forms of
aid, such as in Honduras during the
1980s, have so often ended increasing
the defence budget, further exacerbating
thc plight of those countries' citizens.
Economic restructuring does not mean
starving the women and children. It
means dealing with governmental cor-
ruption, establishing proper financial con-
trols and prioritising money mote
sensibly. If such a course of action is
taken, the IMF should obviously look at
debt rescheduling or cancellation. The
suggestion that this should all be uncon-
ditional is the sort of crypto-socialist, anti-
Western capitalism statement that an
organisation like Third World First would
do well to avoid making.
Sporting Profile
Regular readers will know my admira-
tion for Imperial's sports teams. Every
week, I diligently follow their progress on
the pages of Felix. All our boys and girls
seem to be performing very well at the
moment, and it was good see Spag Bol,
Pink Gash and Spunk skinning the com-
petition alive-o. I lowever, thc news was
not so good with regard to Cross-Coun-
try. Whither Swiss Cottage? What's going
on? And while we're on the subject,
Indian Carpet Catalogue seems to be
keeping a very low profile this season.
The public should be told.
Sweet Dreams
I
t was a long way up to the top. The
ladder seemed to stretch to infinity
and beyond. I tried hard to resist the
annoying urges to look down. I failed.
I lost my grip, I was falling. Falling, fast
into a gaping chasm, falling... falling.
Woaoohhh... I wake up in a pool of
sweat. I glance round my room. My
illustrated book of Psychiatry cast aside
on my bed. I reach for the cold mug of
Nescafe (my fifth dose of essential caf-
feine therapy today)
to dispel the dty, arid
feeling in my throat.
With my biro, I franti-
cally (before the
thoughts escape my
overloaded memory)
make another entry
into my dream diary,
which is my 'thing' of
the moment; some-

Dreams arc just

pure escapism. This is
especially true during

I had the power to control them. This
