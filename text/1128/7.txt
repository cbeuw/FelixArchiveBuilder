The Devil is Back Again
Last week I suggested that many of the
world's problems were caused by the
concept of currency, and specifically the
notion that material wealth is an aim in
itself. College's handling of space allo-
cation in Beit Quad [Felix 1127} is, to my
mind, a prime example of this philoso-
phy in action. Pound signs have won
over promises, financial gain over Union
facilities. We are left with "accommo-
dation favourable for conference/holiday
letting purposes" which translates as
"rooms more expensive than most, built
with the sole aim of increasing the coins
in College's pocket, with little or no
regard for the actual requirements of
students".
I, of course, have my own reasons
for being annoyed at the situation.
Come next July Felix will, once again,
have to move, to a site yet to be decided
upon. It's better than having to move in
mid-November 1998, a proposal seri-
ously suggested shortly before the start
of term, but it's hardly ideal. Still, Felix
and other Pub Board clubs can look for-
ward to the new media centre as a more
permanent home (unless, of course. Col-
lege takes that back as well). Many
other clubs may not be so lucky when
space becomes limited. If you can't find
a room for meetings next year, may I
suggest using the corridors of Level 5
Sherfield.

Who Needs a CCU?
The problems faced by ICSMSU are fairly
desperate, but they are not the only
CCU to find itself in trouble in recent
times. RCSU has been struggling due to
apparent indifference on the part of its
members, while C&GU faced several
crises last year, and arc not exactly out
of the woods yet. I know it's been said
before, but can we really expect organ-
isations based on historical factors that
no longer exist to provide social and
welfare support for students?
New News
You have probably noticed the lack of IC
news in this week's issue. This could be
due to two main reasons. Lither events
are happening and no one in Felix hears
about them, or else that thrce-weeks-left-
of-term quietness has descended over
the campus. Most likely both arc correct.
So please, if you hear of anything inter-
esting happening, let us know. Some-
one emailed us last week to say some
building inspectors were walking round
the BMS commenting on the poor qual-
ity of the work. Unfortunately wc could-
n't find them when we went over there,
but thanks to our anonymous tipster
anyway.
Oh, and if any academic staff are
reading this,- if you know of an office
where Felix could go for a year starting
in July, I would like to hear from you...
