Subzero cool ball goers in polaroids
FANTASTIC MAN MAGAZINE
The most exciting men’s
fashion magazine ever. It has a
clean and calm layout; stylish
and cool content. Be rest as-
sured that Fantastic Man is not
about the meggings but daily,
wearable styles. Apparently
Fashion Society will stock the
magazine next year and Vogue
Italia and French are also
on the agenda. If you prefer
spending £6 on food or booze,
check out the Fashion Soci-
ety’s booth during Fresher’s
Week and see how you can
get your hands on them.
GRANNY GLASSES
Forget RayBans, forget Kanye
West’s sillier than ever slitted
shades. Swap your Raybans
with your nanna, nick her big
and embarrassing pair instead.
Vintage is not just back, it’s
everywhere. Stay ahead of
fashion and try something
different!
HAVAINAS
You know, flip flops are just
flips flops. A £10 pair is the
same as a £2 pair OK? They
are the same material, same
cut, and they look the same.
So if you wish to splash out
£10 on a pair of plastics in-
stead of putting the money in
better use, I can only despise
you.
SICK
SHIT
Kawai Wong shows a collection of Polaroids featuring kids who don’t give a shit about what they do or
what they wear.
Girls, we ask nothing of you this week in felix fashion. Only these – don’t let your
brows run wild, don’t paint your face baffoon-style. Look confident. Like Merkley???’s
models on www.threequestionmarks.com.
If you plan on doing any of the following please write to felix fashion. We will make
sure we command our film crew to make a documentary of you and post it on www.
ILoveVictoriaBeckham.com. Gabby Gentilcore depicts some of the possible
situations that may interest us.

Breaking news
If you idolise Jodie Marsh, steal her
style. Less is more, ladies, less is more.
If you believe in two hearts become
one, let your styles become one too.
If you don’t believe in colour crash,
match your skin tone to your ball
dress, and match your outfit to your
other half who completes you too.
If you plan to confess to your crush the
very night, especially when you need
to try and convince yourself you don’t
really care about the outcome, you just
want him to know. We want to follow
you.
You go through all the troubles of
getting ready for your big night. Nice
dress, nice make up. Only to have re-
jection slammed at your face.
Heart-broken, you resort to drinks.
Drinks after drinks. “It’s his loss!” Lay-
ers after layers of your dignity (and
clothing) stripped away to prove the
point.
Your friends have left you in dis-
gust; you cannot remember a single
detail past the first 15 minutes of the
evening, and are covered in your own,
and many other people’s vomit. And
maybe something else too.
Have a great night, you make fantas-
tic entertainment.
If you plan on breaking the news to
him, do it at the Summer Ball.
So you are a hybrid species of Big
Bird and a colour wheel. So yeah, you
are quite unique, quite totally special.
Yeah.
Only her magic glasses can visualise the invisible owner
of these hands.
Sons, you need steady hands to make sure no drinks are
spilt on your watercolour suit. First order a strawberry
milkshake, then a non-alcoholic Bud.
Come and unlock my chastity belt.
“Close your eyes dude, let’s get teleported outta
here.” “No dude, we’re getting photographed.
That’s never happened before! Giddy giddy.”
I’ll tell you what I want, what I really really want. So
tell me what you want, what you really really want.
Psychiatric ward summer ball.
“Kiss me, bitch.” “Actually...I’m only just wondering how
can you afford tonnes of tarmac on your eyelids and still
keep your eyes open?”
Thai ladyboy from Scotland.
He comes from an era when saying ‘Booyakasha’ is still
considered cool.
