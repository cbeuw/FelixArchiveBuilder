SINGING
Christopher Anthony John Martin
Born in Exeter in 1977, Chris Martin
soon became aware of his prodi-
gious musical talent when he was
sent to harmonica lessons by his
mother at the age of eight. His
then music teacher describ-
ing his abilities as ‘fucking ace’.
Christopher soon began writ-
ing his own bluegrass harmonica
music, winning the Exeter Blue-
grass Championchips by age 12, the
youngest person ever to do so.
During his second year of univer-
sity, Martin was expelled for what
he describes as ‘youthful jubilance’,
but what newspapers at the time
described as ‘indecent exposure dur-
ing a tutorial’. Chris later commented
on the incident in his song Driftwood
with the lyrics “I got my cock out in the
tutorial”
Jonathan Mark Buckland
Jonathan Mark Buckland was born
and raised on a dairy farm in Shrop-
shire. He quickly chose a career in
the dairy industry, and it was only
after a freak lactation accident in
which Buckland lost total move-
ment of his arms that he chose
to give up dairy in favour of a
career in music (although
to this day Buckland still
insists on drinking his milk
directly from the cow).
Buckland is well known
for being the most artistly
creative of the quartet, going by
the nickname within the band of
Jonathan ‘Leonardo Da Vinci’ Buck-
land. He primarily works in the medi-
um of papier-mâché, and most recent-
ly created the band’s figurines for the
video Life in Technicolour 2. In a recent
interview, Chris Martin commented:
“He likes his papier-mâché does our
Jonathan”.
Guy Rupert Berryman
Born in Toronto in 1988, Guy Berry-
man settled in Worthing, West Sussex
at the age of 10 and later went on to
study Physics at Imperial College
London. Upon completion of his
degree, Berryman joined the
NASA space program, conduct-
ing research into zero-gravity
spectroscopic absorbtion effects
in organic compounds. He was
also the first person to drink
his own urine in space.
Berryman joined Coldplay
after meeting lead vocalist
Chris Martin in a karaoke bar,
the two finding common ground
over their love of West End
show-tunes and singing a duet of
Meatloaf’s I would do anything for
love.
William ‘Will’ Champion
William Champion was born in
Milton Keynes in 1974, the son of
an accountant and a bookmaker.
His favourite subjects in school
were Maths and Geography. He
was alright at them, but never very
good.
Champion’s favourite colour
is greyish beige and his favour-
ite food is the mild cheddar cheese
sandwich. in his spare time, Champi-
on enjoes creating PowerPoint pres-
entations about the television he has
watched, and then deleting them.
In a recent article written in some
publication, Champion claimed to
have invented the name ‘Coldplay’, de-
scribing the process of its creation as
“...like taking a mathematical average
of all band names, which reflects the
tone of our music quite well, as sort of
the average of all music”.

Coldplay
A
nyone who pays too
much attention to my
ramblings every week or
so will probably have no-
ticed my general dislike
for generic indie-pop quartet Coldplay.
In the past I have used them as whip-
ping boys for a musical ultra-main-
stream whose aesthetics I sometimes
disagree with and often disdain. I have
claimed that they are the prime exam-
ple of the blandness that is pumped
into the minds of the population via
television and radio – a soulless, emo-
tionless swill created for mass con-
sumption using corporate market re-
search techniques and used as a means
of making profit rather than a means of
expressing, well, anything whatsoever.
A gnawing blandness which grates the
senses and erodes the emotion from
everyday life.
However, this being the final issue of
felix of the year, I thought it was time
I got something off my chest. Despite
the blandness, despite the incessant
4-4 timing of every single song, despite
the feeling of impending, irreversible
loss of cognitive functioning every
time someone lists them as one of their
favourite bands, I FUCKING LOVE
COLDPLAY. I absolutely adore them.
I want to shout it, proclaim it from the
top of the Queen’s Tower “I am in love
with Chris Martin”.
I have harboured this terrible secret
for so long. As the trendy music sec-
tion editor of a trendy student publica-
tion, I just wanted to appear edgy and
offer an alternative perspective to the
mainstream press, but it was all a sham
– a sham that I am happy to rid myself
of as I step out of the indie-pop closet.
Phew, that feels better. While I’m at
it, I also like the Kaiser Chiefs, Two
Pints of Lager, and grating my cock
with a cheesegrater while wearing a
cat-suit and whistling the French na-
tional anthem.
Yep.
Scientists have recently discovered aurora borealis to be the sun
literally shining out of Chris Martin’s arse
Peter Sinclair
A discovery by scientists at University
College London has proved the link
between the music of Coldplay and
world peace.
Coldplay’s lead vocalist and mod-
ern-age messiah Chris Martin said in
a statement to the associated press
“The world peace is what I got in this
business for. The fact that my music is
great is merely a happy coincidence”.
Hundreds of thousands of copies of
the popular indie band’s latest album
Viva la Vida are currently being trans-
ported by container ship to volatile ar-
eas of Iraq, and massive loudspeakers
have been set up on the border of North
Korea in an effort to beat Pyongyang
into submission. Locals have described
the music as “distressing”.

Which acts to see:
Our favorite mix of music, theatre, comedy, literature and
cabaret returns for its fourth innings on the 16th - 19th July
Latitude is a pretty big deal for such a
young festival. Started back in 2006,
it’s rapid growth and continued popu-
larity, at a time when new festivals are
springing up all over the place, is down
to the great line-ups and the wide
range of acts playing.
It’s mix of music and other creative
arts creates a unique atmosphere, and
from the look of the line-up released so
far, this year’s is shaping up pretty well.
Music at Latitude is spread across
four stages, The Obelisk Arena will
host many of the larger acts, with Pet
Shop Boys, Grace Jones, Nick Cave &
The Bad Seeds joined by more mod-
ern artists like Of Montreal, Regina
Spektor and Thom Yorke.
This is the first time the Radiohead
main man has done a full solo set and
promises to be the highlight of the fes-
tival. Word is that his set will be a mix
of ‘The Eraser’ tracks along with some
acoutic Radiohead songs, which could
just be the best possible way to spend a
Sunday afternoon.
The other music stages form the
background for less well known acts
with Bat for Lashes, Lykke Li, 65day-
sofstatic, Magazine, Mirrors, Villagers
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
Fever Ray Mew Of Montreal Speech
Debelle
Camera
Obscura
Maps The XX Passion Pit
Thom Yorke Wild Beasts !!! iliketrains
Karin Dreijer Andersson, half of The
Knife, takes the stage name Fever Ray
in her first solo project. Expect to hear
most of the tracks from the self-titled
album released earlier this year.
Dark repeating electronic music
and intense lyrics combine creating
transfixing songs full of dread which
should make for an incredible live
performance.
A Danish Alternative Rock/Indie band
with hints of Shoegaze and Post-Rock
sounds. Lead singer Jonas Bjerre’s dis-
tinctive high pitched voice makes Mew
instantly recognisable. Expect interest-
ing visuals backing the music.
With a new album out this Septem-
ber, they should preview new songs
along with classics off ‘Frengers’ and
‘And The Glass Handed Kites’
They are not, as you might think,
named after the Canadian city but in-
stead a girl called Montreal.
Famous for successfully combin-
ing musical experimentation with
catchy melodies, they can even create
singlong choruses about divorce that
work.
The stage show will be a brightly col-
oured extravaganza.
Shoegaze by definition, Maps released
a new single this May and will be re-
leasing a new album in September
called Turning of the Mind. His songs
have a certain magical feeling that is
hard to describe.
In 2007 they were shortlisted for the
Mercury Music Prize which raised his
profile dramatically.
Young Turks-signed, South London-
ers The XX recently released their first
single with their debut album dropping
in July.
They make new wave dream pop
songs that have a casual feel to them
and give off an air of effortless cool-
ness. Check out the tracks ‘Crystalised’
and their cover of Womack and Wom-
ack’s ‘Teardrops’.
Passion Pit make great summer pop
songs that are reminiscent of past
times, while also sounding fresh and
exciting. The first album from the
Massachusett’s ‘Manners’ is loud, fun
and full of great pop songs.
They may lack depth, and wear their
influences on their sleeves, but when
the sun is out and the cider’s flowing
who cares.
Lead singer of Radiohead. Ridiculously
famous and rightly so. I once met in a
record shop and he signed a 7” for me
– best birthday present I’ve ever had.
This will be his first solo set since
the release of Eraser. Does this suggest
their might be something new soon?
Wild Beasts’ specific brand of indie is
both nostalgic and refreshing in one
bite sized piece. Alliterative lyrics and
ambitious arrangements marked Wild
Beasts as ones to watch last year.
They have a new album out in Sep-
tember so expect previews as well as a
selection from the magnificant Limbo,
Panto.
Dance-punk band !!! dived into the
mainstream with their 2004 album
Louden Up Now followed by Myth
Takes in 2007.
Their highly energetic live shows
have kept fans dancing for the last few
years, despite a lack of new material.
Definitely a band worth checking out
live, listen to ‘All My Heroes Are Weir-
do’ for a taster.
iLiKETRAiNS’ historical post-rock
has gone from strength to strength
in the last few years. They focus their
songs on specific events of the past
such as the Salem Witch Hunt, Great
Fire of London and various fictional
ones too.
Their songs are accompanied by at-
mospheric visuals that guide the audi-
ence along in a reflective trance.
Tipped as one to look out for this year,
Ninja Tunes-signed, South Londoner
Speech Debelle creates beautiful and
honest hip-hop.
Yet to release an album, expect to
hear her first few singles along with a
few previously unheard songs.
A guide to the best bands of the weekend
Delightful, intricate, mature, fragile.
These are some of the adjectives I am
currently using to describe Camera
Obscura. This charming band are on
tour this summer to promote their
new album, and also to cheer up all you
glum folks. Best served chilled in the
A.M. with a cup of tea and a croissant.
and Wildbirds and Peacedrums along
with a load more. Check out the little
guide below for our recommendations
about the best bands playing.
Long-haired man Ed Bryrne, Jo
Brand and Sean Lock will bring a bit of
laughs to the comedy arena. The Film
& Music Arena will host award win-
ning films, questions and answer ses-
sions with acclaimed directors along
with musical interpretations of visual
arts.
The Cabaret, Literary, Poetry, Thea-
tre and Outdoor art arenas are filled
with great acts that are well worth
exploring.
Latitude runs between the 16th and
19th of July near Southwold in Suf-
folk and the full line up is yet to be
announced.
