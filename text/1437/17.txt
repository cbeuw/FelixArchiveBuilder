There’re over a dozen different mar-
tial arts clubs at Imperial. Their
names span the alphabet from aiki-
do to wushu, and their geographical
origins range from South America to
Far East Asia. On Sunday they all got
together for an afternoon of practice
sessions at Ethos. Four clubs ran a
one-hour workshop each, to intro-
duce the others to their martial art.
The day literally kicked off with tae
kwon do, one of the few martial arts
played at the Olympics. The tae kwon
do club led the warm-up and stretch-
ing as well as the first session. The
club set a high pace and really pushed
us hard. Very soon all 30 partici-
pants were dripping with sweat while
throwing kicks and punches at the
pads offered by the instructors. Un-
der their supervision and encourage-
ment we progressed quickly to more
and more advanced techniques until
we were finally let loose on each other
for a gentle round of sparring.
The second session introduced ken-
do, a sport derived from the ancient
Japanese swordsmanship. As kendo
players use bamboo swords and wear
full body armor this session was in
interesting contrast to the previous
unarmed discipline. Starting from
basic food work, we soon were given
our own bamboo sword to practice
the typical kendo posture, the strik-
ing distance and of course the loud
Japanese battle cry. After extensively
yelling at each other while maintain-
ing the correct attacking distance, the
session was concluded by two fully
armored kendo players who demon-
strated some of their skills.
With sore throat and aching mus-
cles everybody quickly grabbed
homemade muffins and lots of water
before heading straight into the third
C
ontinuing in a Telegraph-
esque fashion with the
farce that is the ACC
Colours ceremony, felix
sport have been inundat-
ed with letters supporting our stance.
One certain club member has com-
mented on another club member who
happened to receive colours, chiming
“Back then, I used to think s/he was fit,
then I thought s/he was OK, but now
I think s/he is well rank and fucking
annoying.” Moving on, another letter
we received commented on Samuel
Furse. Summing up “... he’s a fraud, he’s
friends with someone called Tarquin
and he doesn’t need any more money
from the union to play polo with Nes-

tor Kirchner and family.”
His crony Joseph Lees received simi-
lar abuse: “How can you give the bas-
ketball team two grand extra when you
have attracted less and less students,
year-on-year for the past few years.
What are you, dyslexic?”
Sport Imperial might have informed
us that to celebrate the achievements of
both the Netball and Rugby Women’s
1sts, they have organised along with
BUCS, trials for the England Universi-
ties squads in their respective sports.
You heard it here first ladies.
Like French, Spanish, Italian and
Japanese level 1 language classes, the
union have finally taken heed and now
hold the view that the Royal School of
Mines sports teams are utterly useless
and should either be offloaded to the
equally useless Royal Veterinary Col-
lege or subsumed amongst the college
teams, if they can get into the lowest
teams that is.
Similar in manner to David Charles’
self-awarding of an RCSU fellowship, I
would like to congratulate myslef on an
outstanding year as sports editor. My
input on the ACC scandal was not only
informative but relevant and balanced
in approach and delivery. I have never
failed to turn up on time and I have
often contributed to other sections of
the paper when other editors are too
spaced/stressed out to deal with the
workings of the well-oiled machine
that is felix.
My colleague Mustapher Botchway
is nothing but a bone idle imbecile
who fraudulently claimed incapacity
benefit during the period of his injured
hand. On several occasions I managed
to see him necking pints of water in the
union on most nights during this term.
I hope I never breed a bunch of skiving
students in my career as a teacher as I
have seen in my colleague.
Saying that, both of us would like to
thank the six of you that read our pages
week-in-week-out over the past year.
We really don’t hope you have enjoyed
reading them as much as much as we
