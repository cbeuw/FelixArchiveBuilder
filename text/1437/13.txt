The Oh-bitch-uaries – 2009 Edition
A
h receipts, those little
paper reminders of how
you’ve wasted your stu-
dent loan. They are life’s
little insurance slips, giv-
Don’t give me those eyes... it
won’t work! I love my wife!
It’s ok, you don’t technically have
to stay at work after four o’clock
Alright, fine it’s not very big, you
don’t have to go on about it
Words cannot describe how much
I just vomited in my own mouth
Jenny Morgan
Cause of death: Defenestrated
(thrown out of a window... fools)
T
here are days when Jen-
nifer Morgan was in the
office. I swear this isn’t a
joke. I’ve seen her there
twice. Personally. These
weren’t even rumours.
Jenny was quite easily our favourite
Sabbatical Officer. Not because she is a
pirate, but mostly because she is NOT
a ninja. I’ve hear people try to come up
with crazy lies about nun-chucks out-
side her office. This is blatant libel –the
kind that this fine newspaper tends to
want to print on a regular basis but the
late Johvan Nedick was too much of
a girl to ever publish. By the way, Jo-
van actually misspelt his own name in
some of the earlier issues.
Jenny did not take this lightly...
Her achievements were manifold,
not only did she make the arduous
journey to her office twice (see above)
she was almost never, ever grumpy.
Or disinterested, or blatantly bored
and rude to people’s faces on impor-
tant student issues. Hangman is never
sarcastic.
It appears, that she was right to avoid
the offices. Even though she spent so
much of her time, getting along with
the other sabbs and staff (Hangman
is never sarcastic), they threw pushed
asked her politely to go out the win-
dow. It was a gorgeous, splattering,
sexy mess on the floor. Awww splaff!
Christian Carter
Cause of death: Murdered by
girlfriend in his sleep
W
hen you think of
Christian Carter,
you might remem-
ber him as the
DPFS candidate
that should have been beaten by RON.
If you are not hack however, you’ll
definitely know him from his recurring
role as Beaker in the great TV show
that was The Muppets. Christian grew
up facing vast criticisms and amidst
many disconcerting news stories of
midget orgies and puppet torture. His
rise to fame was stellar, but now but
his career at Imperial cemented him as
a dying star in a boring galaxy in the
middle of a boring part of a boring uni-
verse. The perfect demise.
During his Office term, wannabe
ponce and Tory Christian came into
contact with a succubus by the name
of Fiona O’Connell. Every night after
bizarre and criminal sex sessions with
her, Carter would fall asleep almost
immediately. When deep in slum-
ber, Fiona would slowly suck his soul
and a little bit of his life with it at the
same time. Weeks and weeks of this
nightly ritual finally took their toll
on a drained Deputy President and
he finally succumbed to an untimely
death. The Police seems to think Miss
O’Connell is on the run. A medium has
told Hangman she will win the election
to become ICU’s new DPFS next year.
Hannah Theodorou
Cause of death: Drowned in a sea
of urine
A
fact that many people
are unaware of is that
Hannah was born in the
tiny island of Rhodes in
Greece. She spent her
childhood eating olives and drinking
olive oil. Her love for oil based prod-
ucts was never questioned by her
peers. As a child, she was never the
prettiest kid and as a result fled to Ro-
mania where she spent much of her
youth working in a soap factory. When
breasts started developing in what was
a huge project for her, the boys started
paying attention to the girl in pigtails.
Hannah revelled in this newfound at-
tention and worked as a hostess in a
brothel for many years before embark-
ing on a fulfilling career to become a
urologist at Imperial College.
Hannah was excited when an invita-
tion was put through the mailbox of
her Brixton estate. It was an invitation
to an orgy of “urinary” proportions.
As she dressed in her “fuck me
pumps” so aptly described by Imperial
Girl, she had no idea what lay in store
for her.
In fact the invitation was from the
Sci Fi society. They awaited with full
bladders and pounced with gallons of
warm flowing goodness. Alright...
As a medic, Hannah wished that she
had told them to drink less carbonated
beverages... it was a smelly end, sozlolz.
Lily Topham
Cause of death: Choked to death,
by a silhouetted figure
T
opham. It sounds like the
Top of the Ham. Get it?
It’s funny because I did a
little pun involving Lily’s
name. The reason I did
this is because there is absolutely noth-
ing to say about Lily. She is known as a
complete non-entity.
Ok fine, I’ll write something about
her.
Lily has been a fine Deputy Presi-
dent of Clubs (cockheads) and Socie-
ties (syphilis). Under her boring rule,
club discipline has increased to never
before seen levels of moral rectitude.
The Football Club now almost never
trashes pubs in Hammersmith.
Now they spend their days over at
Lily’s dark basement, putting on plays
for her, so that she knows what she
puts the rest of Imperial through when
she takes the stage, or the director’s
chair, or the 430 from Putney Bridge.
She loves that bus, the bus doesn’t love
her back, nobody loves her back. No-
body who’s ever met her, knows what
love is anymore...
She was strangled in her bed, one
evening. We have no idea how this
happened, we totally did not murder
Lily Topham, I promise. If we knew
what love was, we’d love her... right...
A post-mortem found marbles in her
va-jay-jay (best euphemism ever). We
love you Oprah, not you Lily.
Mark Chamberlain
Cause of death: Killed by other
Sabbs envious of his high salary
S
ame old, same old for Mark
Chamberlain, the not-so-
beloved Medic President.
Known to most of his frene-
mies as Chumberbum, Mark
was a great fan of BDSM (Bondage,
Domination and Sadomasochism for
those not in his circle of perverted sex
fiend friends).
Never to be seen in his office, it is
likely that he was at the strip club
putting fivers in the G-strings of
tanned and oiled barely legal boys. His
life was one of pure debauchery, that
his overly inflated Sabbatical salary
provided him with.
Chumberbum’s hobbies were diverse
and they included purchasing stock-
ings, wearing stockings, purchasing
butt plus, and using butt plugs. These
seem to be along the same lines but for
a lover of all things dirty, Mark can see
much distinction in all of them.
While Mark was performing an act
of auto-erotic self asphyxiation one
fine day last week, he was surprised
by his fellow Sabbatical Officers who
tortured him by putting needles in his
eyeballs and playing football with his
newly severed head. As the old saying
goes, “If kinky sex shit doesn’t kill you,
Imperial College Good-for-Nothing
Officers will”. Okay fine, I made that
one up, but it is completely befitting of
the situation.
They were so close to completing their terms as Sabbaticals but unfortunately fate intervened and they have
all come to sticky ends. Although, they wouldn’t have survived long in real world anyway so... meh...
ing you hope that if you really needed
the money, you could march into
American Apparel, flourish your re-
ceipt and demand you statutory rights
as a consumer (which would not be
affected). That’s why of course, your
wallet bulges with old receipts for that
scone you bought 3 years ago.
More often than not, we don’t return
our purchases, especially not for food
(apart maybe when you buy milk that’s
off from Tescos but then still, that Tes-
cos down the road is rather far... just
hold your nose...). So then why, in the
name of Beelzebub’s kid sister, does the
Library Cafe insist on giving a receipt
for every measly bottle of water!
Is it because they think that we buy
our food on some ethereal expenses ac-
count and that we’ll need proof of our
spendings? In any case, it’s killing the
trees and the lemurs and stuff and no-
body wants one. Nobody. Now stop it!
Before the year ends, and I go have
an awesome summer while you have a
shit one, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for all the
things I’ve said... to your mum... when
I’m slamming her in your bed... Bye!
Felix Editor takes over Union in orange
revolution
Felix Editor Jovan Nedic (that’s ‘The
Supreme Leader, His Holiness the Don’
to you - Ed) last night usurped rightful-
ly removed in the name of the people
the democratic corrupt structures of
the Union and proclaimed himself ac-
cepted on behalf of the people the title
Supreme Leader, the Don.
According to reports from Hang-
man’s team of field (feeble) reporters,
Mr Nedic and a team of supporters,
also known as “The Lads’ marched
on the Union offices as the President
and other officers were preparing to
go home for the evening at 6pm. The
President was given the option of leav-
ing peacefully but apparently refused
declaring “FOR THE LAST FUCKING
TIME, WE DO NOT NEGOTIATE
BLEUGHR!”
After this, events turned violent with
the entire Union staff being defenes-
trated (best word ever, please look it
up). Deputy President Christian Carter
is reputed to have escaped the nights
bloody happenings as he had gone
home at 4pm.
Mr Nedic has since cracked down
on free expression (another word and
you’re dead - Ed)
Students are said to be ambivalent
about the change of leadership with
one cynically observing “Still it’s better
than the N.U.S.”
Hangman’s Political Analyst Rupert
Humbertdinkleweather said “After
looking at Mr Nedic’s manifesto for
change on Page 5, it’s obvious that he
plans to shake things up. It remains to
be seen whether he can run the Union
any better than he ran felix. Expect to
see spelling mistakes in Union emails”
Mr Nedic commented “the fu-
ture’s bright, the future’s disturbingly
orange”
