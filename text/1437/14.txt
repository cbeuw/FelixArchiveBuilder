Wordoku 1,437
Ok. Really sorry. I have no idea how I managed to cock up
last week’s wordoku quite so badly, but meah, shit happens.
For those of you who are a little lost, to create a wordoku
you must think of a nine letter word with no repetitions. My
choice of word, RENTGIRLS clearly had two R’s in it. Fail.
To make things even better I also chucked a random 6 into
the mixer. Humm. I blame it on post exam stress... or think-
ing about it Mr Gin and Mr Tonic. Anyhoo I must say I am
uber impressed with MÖchten sie mein Manschaft? who
despite my numerous fails did get a correct answer in. They
were the only ones to do so mind you!
Scribble box
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.

ts been megamatron close at the
top of the FUCWIT and I think
we can class its return as a suc-
cess. Each week numerous en-
tries pour in soon after the pa-
per is delivered, so I must thank you all
so spending your time to write into us.
Despite what we may have said we are
all very grateful. Looking forward to
next year, we hope to retain the prizes
scheme so please more of you get in-
volved- especially in the individual
class. However there can only be one
winner (well five if you look at it that
way!), and whilst Giramondo wrapped
up the individual win many weeks
ago, Team Shotgon and MÖchten sie
mein Manschaft? have been exchang-
ing blows all year long. Team Shotgun
finally triumphing by a meagre five
points.
I offer my congratulations to every-
one who has entered this year and had
their name in the paper. Competition
has been extremely stiff you should be
proud. Winners... COLLECT THOSE
IPODS!!!!!

Sorry guys, I fucked up bad
Team Shotgun in all their finest. Outright FUCWIT winners 2008-2009 Giramondo- Individual champion
Cancer
You are a warrior. You
run, run, runaway, it
was only your heart
that you let down.
Shoot down the walls
of heartache, get back
out there into the game of life. Like a special
man take another bite- who’s the hunter? Who’s
the game? This time you are both, if you survive
you will be the most prestigious warrior that has
ever lived. Grab it with both hands.
Virgo
By finishing your
exams you reach
total boredom. Do
not despair and take
your anger out on
your dearest. You
have nowhere to run, and nowhere to go. So do
something with your life, try train spotting. If you
don’t the devil which has been put aside until this
point may be released to drastic consequences.
Take care in what you do, love is strong.
Gemini
This week you fin-
ish another year at
university and want
to plan a party. The
warden says no, so
you must use your
negotiation skill to persuade him. Do not fight
for your right to party. If you fight you will
learn nothing your mind is your best tool- use it
to its full capacity. In the future weeks you will
look back with pride.
Pisces
Look at your life,
things it has been a
bad year and this week
will not get better
until you light up. It’s
now of never- you
ain’t going to live forever. You have to initatiate
it yourself- as if you have a choice. I can hardly
stress enough how much you need to raise your
voice and say “I am ...... and I am a person. I am
going to fight for my right. My right to luck.”
Leo
This week will bring
prosperity and easy,
simple mornings. This
will all culminate into
a Sunday morning that
will make you realise
that you are currently in the prime of your life.
You are young, happy, worry free and clever. Go
on, push yourself this Sunday morning- don’t
take it easy, who knows what to exactly to expect,
but expect great things.
Aries
Sometimes you
dream that some-
times it seems that
there is nothing there
at all, you just feel
older than yesterday
and live waiting for tomorrow to come. Look-
ing out the curtain one thing is for certain- you
are cosy in you room... You can’t stay cooped
up there forever- venture out onto the sun,
chase the hoofbeats of love.
Scorpio
It’s the end of term
and you are looking
forward to the country
roads that take you
home. Life is a year old-
er, possibly older than
the trees that have grown now leaves. Take a few
minutes to stand at your window with you hair
blowing in the breeze and watch your mother ar-
rive to take you home, she’ll take you home down
those country roads.
Libra
She wants you in her
room. He wants you in
his room. What more
can you want. Boom
boom boom, all you
want is each other to
spend the night together, from now until forever.
Tog get this, step out of character- go crazy, do
something unbecoming of you. Its all she needs
to prove to her that you are what she wants. You
want her, she wants you... go to Ibiza.
Taurus
Lightening crashes
about you. All hope
looks like it is lost,
but you must rely
on love to bring you
though. Confusion
may set in, but close the door do not let the evil
diffuse into your thoughts. You’ll find that the
angles will open your eyes and the confusion
will be banished. Let the warm radiance of love
settle you. You will feel it, you will feel it.
Horoscopes, all your trials for the forthcoming week
He made a grown man cry, but fear not- Horoscopes have been started up again. Can they compete?
Capricorn
Looking in her eyes
you see a paradise, this
world that you found is
too good to be true. Put
your arms around her,
and don’t ever let go.
Put your hands in her hand, don’t ever look back.
Even if the world begins to fall down around you,
forget it. You can build this thing together. Noth-
ing will stop you now. You were made for each
other and the love you spawn is beautiful. Pint?
Aquarius
The stars are aligned
in a way that looks
positive for you. I
feel that its only days
before you realise
that your dreams
are withing your grasp. The moondust will
sprinkle down upon you and aid you in your
moment of reflection. Do not be too hasty
though- the alignment of the stars are not to be
rushed.

Sagittarius
Hello out there all
Sagittariusites. You may
have been born down
in a dead mans town,
with the first kick being
taken as you hit the
ground, but you’ve done it. You have completed
you first year at uni, soon someone will put a rifle
in your hands, send you off to foreign land to
kill the yellow man. We bid you a fond farewell,
please come to see us as soon as you can son.

thing.

Coffee Break
Ravi Pall
Coffee Break Editor
My Reign is
over!
T
his issue of felix is our last.
For the year, not ever. Well
this means one thing. This
is my last Coffee Break sec-
tion ever! Don’t cry dear
fans, I am not leaving felix, just moving
on to do other things. Things like pho-
toshopping random pictures, perhaps
doing some news stories and comment.
Who knows right now, just pick up an
issue next year and have a gander. The
big question is who will replace me?
Well isn’t it obvious? The one and only
Charles Murdoch. Throughout the year
he has been selectively and secretly
trained in the art of procrastination,
and now team felix believes he is ready.
Ready for the big time baby, Oh yeah!
So what have we learned this year? I
think we have proven the resurrected
FUCWIT league has been a hugh suc-
cess, with numerous entries pouring
in each week. With a fierce battle be-
tween Team Shotgun and Mochten sie
mein manshaft? all year, Team Shot-
gun won by the smallest of margins.
Only 5 Points separate the two impres-
sive teams. While Giramondo claims
top place in the individual league table.
Well done to everyone who participat-
ed and let hope the enthusiasm contin-
ues to next year.
We also learned that it can be funny
to make up lies and rumours about
the current and elected Sabbaticals.
Let me take a moment to remind you
again, that this was a joke, and give our
apologies to all offended parties.
Lastly I would like to comment on
the massive success that is the ding-
bats. Something I thought wouldn’t
take off, but has proven me wrong. A
fun little puzzle to do each week, that
makes you think. In fact the idea is in-
genious. I personally am liking the new
and improved graphical dingbats that
can be viewed bellow.
This year we have also had some
fun. There was the great Twitter race,
the ethnic top trumps and the “Stuff
IC students Like” Lets not forget the
greatness that was relentless. We also
had a Photoshop competition, which
provided many amusing moments. In
particular the one with the characters
from Aquateen Hungerforce come to
mind. I have had fun providing enter-
tainment to you readers his year, and
will miss the unadulterate fun that is
synonymous with the job, but all great
things come to an end, only to be start-
ed up again next academic season.
I hope you have had a good year, and
for those that haven’t finished exams,
unlucky, but at least there will be some
puzzles for you to do. Until next year,
where you’ll get the answers :)
