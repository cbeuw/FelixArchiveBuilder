Congratulations to Team Shotgun
who were the first team to get the cor-
rect answer in this week, again
Well we hope that you enjoyed the
cryptic crosswords this year. They will
be back next year and they will still
count for double points in the FUC-
WIT League, so get practising over the
summer and who knows, you might
become so good at it that you could set
a cryptic crossword of your own.

Michael Owen has been linked to a
high profile switch to Imperial Col-
lege Football Club in a move which
could see the recently out of favour
humanities department moving north
to Tyneside.
The former England and Newcastle
striker was released following the ex-
piry of his contract in May 2009 and
has struggled to find interest from
suitable premiership clubs as a result
of his injury littered past and £50,000
per week asking price. However if re-
ports are to be believed, Newcastle
have agreed to fund a proportion of
the players wage in exchange for the
former Imperial humanities depart-
ment moving to St. James’s Park.
Caretaker manager Alan Shearer
has expressed his interest in installing
a degree of culture amongst his squad.
Current players have also shown sup-
port for the swap with Joey Barton ex-
cited about increasing his already en-
cyclopaedic knowledge on the History
session. The wushu club introduced
the kung fu style of drunken box-
ing. Under the superb tutoring of the
wushu instructor we learned a rou-
tine of movements: pretending to be
drunk, stumbling around and falling
flat on our faces while actually throw-
ing punches and applying joint locks
disguised as taking another drink.
Now already bruised and slightly
exhausted but at the same time very
excited and happy we tapped our last
energy resources for Thai kickbox-
ing, the final session of the day. The
Thai kickboxing club spared no ef-
fort and moved an immense amount
of equipment down from Paddington
where they normally practice. They
provided boxing gloves and shin pads
for everyone as well as pads for dem-
onstrations. The next hour was spent
practicing the characteristic Thai
kickboxing techniques: kicks with
shins and knees to the upper body
and to the legs, and the close combat
fight called clinching. By this time all
clubs were fully mingled. Everybody
was exchanging ideas and tips, and
discovering or applying techniques
from their own sport in the other
disciplines.
Completely exhausted, bruised and
blistered but with huge smiles on our
faces we left Ethos at 5pm for the Un-
ion bar where we spent the evening
re-hydrating, relaxing and discussing
our impressions of the day. The event
has clearly shown how much the
martial arts at Imperial have in com-
mon - in their techniques as well as in
spirit. The workshop day has brought
our clubs closer together and it will
certainly be followed up by similar
events in the near future. Next time
with even more different martial arts,
sweat, food and fun!
Imperial in the spotlight owing
to transfer speculation
James Skeen
ICU Half-Colours Recipient &
Part-time Correspondent
of Modern Art, and Shola Ameobi re-
alising a life-long dream of studying
the Roman Empire.
Imperial College Football Club Cap-
tain James Skeen was unavailable for
comment but sources close to the
matter believe Michael Owen could
be the perfect solution to ICUAFC
5th XI goal drought and if he can
maintain his fitness levels, could
move higher in the future.
The club are believed to have re-
ceived one of the exclusive 30 page
dossiers released by Michael Owen’s
management, detailing the highlights
of the player’s career.
Michael Owen said: “Well, in an
ideal world I want to succeed here,
play as much as I can and score many
goals.”
Negotiations are in their early stages
but both parties are interested in re-
solving the matter as soon as possible.
The last time a sports club was
linked with someone in the media eye
was in January of this year when pop
artist Craig David approached the Im-
perial archery team with the proposi-
tion of becoming their bow selector.
have enjoyed writing these pages. Do
you think it is fun sitting here submit-
ting pages to a paper which was meant
to be sent off 2 hours and twenty six
minutes ago?
We would finally like to send a big
thank you to our commander in chief
Jovan NediĆ for his patience over the
last 9 months. We have managed to
submit our pages on time a grand total
of one and half times. The half being
when Jov completed 75% of our work.
On to more serious news, as Jack is
leaving this year, we are looking for an
editor to join the team next year. Due
to the relative lack of articles about
sport from the medical schools we
would like to welcome a medical stu-
dent to the team to offer more balance
to these pages next year. If you are in-
terested please send an email to sport.
felix@imperial.ac.uk and we will take it
from there.
Before we leave you, the guys at
Sport Imperial are shelling out a figure
in the tens of thousands of pounds for
another rowing boat as the said club’s
boats sank due to a overloading of
BUCS points.
