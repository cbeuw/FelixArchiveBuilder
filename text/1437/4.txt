I
t all seemed rather impres-
sive: swipe cards, RFID, strange
looking keyholes and a security
guard on-hand to testify about
the impressive security of the
Southside ‘complex’. At least that is
how it was presented during freshers
week. We were told that so long as our
doors were shut correctly that it was
almost impossible to break in and that
all burglaries thus-far had been as a
result of students not shutting their
doors.
So that’s exactly what the 350+ fresh-
ers living in Southside did — in the be-
lief that they were secure. Of course,
it was not long before the more astute
students realised that it was theoreti-
cally possible to open the doors using
a credit card. A Hollywood favourite
shimming is a lock-bypass technique
whereby a flexible object — such as
a credit card — is slid in between the
door and the frame and used to ma-
nipulate the latch. For this to work two
conditions must be satisfied.
Firstly, the door can not be dead bolt-
ed, which is when bolt is connected di-
rectly to the locking cylinder. Thus the
only way to move the bolt is to rotate
the cylinder — which requires the key
to be inserted. Although most house
locks are dead bolted those in South-
side are not. This is as a result of the
swipe card access system. (In order for
the doors to automatically lock when
closed the latch must always be free to
move.)
Secondly, there must be sufficient
space between the frame and the door
to allow a shim to be inserted. Al-
though this should never be the case
there is no substitute for shoddy work-
manship, as I will get into later.
While you occasionally heard stories
of someone in another Southside hall
managing to get into their rooms us-
ing a credit card, few took them seri-
ously, assuming that his/her door had
shifted significantly to make it possi-
ble. Until, that is, I tried it myself.
After five minutes R&D with a fel-
low Physicist and an empty coke can
we had created our own shim. Being
made of aluminium it was a good deal
thinner than a credit card and much
better shaped. Using this we were able
to open (with permission, naturally)
over 70% of the doors we tried. Usu-
ally the entire process, from inserting
the shim to opening the door takes a
smidgeon under five seconds. Five
seconds!
Some of the doors are so bad that it
is possible to open them by wedging
an unfolded Tropicana carton in be-
tween the door and the frame and jig-
gling it around for a few seconds.
But, there’s more. Each person in
Southside has a lockable drawer in
Is your room in Southside safe?
Freddie Witherden, resident of Southside, finds out how easy it
is to break into the rooms and secure lockers
their wardrobe. Perfect for valuables,
such as cash, passports &c — or so we
thought. Sadly the locks used on these
drawers are some of the poorest I have
come across in my two years of pick-
ing. In lock-jargon terms: the locks
have an open rectangular keyhole with
a single row of three pins; none of
which are security pins.
With a set of lock picks it is possible
to open any of the drawers in South-
side in under ten seconds, on average.
However to add insult to injury, so to
speak, it is possible to open them in a
similar amount of time using nothing
but a screwdriver and metal paper clip.
Although those with any experience
picking locks normally frown at the
use of paper clips (on most real locks
they are useless) the locks in Southside
are so exceptionally poor that they are
actually a valid option.
It is a somewhat disturbing thought
that a would-be burglar needs noth-
ing more than a folded up coke can,
a screwdriver and a paper clip to be
able to successfully mount an crime
spree on most of the rooms in South-
side. Moreover with tailgating into the
building as easy as it is this is some-
thing of a real concern for both myself
and others who I have talked to on the
issue.
So, what can be done about all of
this? Well, in the short term, very lit-
tle. Thankfully with only one week left
and very few (if any) robberies this
year us Southside residents can con-
sider ourselves lucky.
In the long term security and resi-
dency will need to look at each and
every door in Southside and see if it
is vulnerable to shimming. If this is
the case then the door will need to be
reseated such that it is impossible to
insert a shim.
If nothing is done then I would not
be surprised if by the time next years
lambs come to the slaughter (I mean,
err, freshers) that over 85% of the
doors could be susceptible to shim-
ming. This is because Southside ap-
pears to be either (depending on who
you talk to) still settling or subsiding;
resulting in ever larger gaps between
doors and frames.
As for the lockable drawers, my per-
sonal recommendation is that locks
on each drawer are changed to some-
thing more substantial. It is somewhat
ironic that the locks on the doors —
which are seldom used — are some of
the best in the industry (jargon: Mul-
T-lock Classic dimple locks featuring
pins-in-pins, layman: reasonably diffi-
cult to pick) while the drawer locks are
some of the worst available.
Finally, what does this mean for the
new Eastside halls? While I have not
visited Eastside yet I would not be
surprised if it uses the same set-up as
Southside and so is also likely to be
equally vulnerable.
All you need is a metallic can to open the doors...
