Hack gives hack Fellowship to
his own Union...
LOLCATZ
of
teH
WEEK
Last week saw an ancient tradition
which has existed since the dawn of
hacks. I am, of course, talking about
the Imperial College Union Colours
ceremony where hacks acknowledge
the hackery of other hacks.
The ceremony included food, as
well as numerous bottles of wine and
beer, which they didn’t touch (we did
though, it would be a great shame to let
such a fine selection of food and drink
go to waste!).
A range of hack species went up to
collect their certificates, each show-
ing various levels of appreciation for
their award, with the few non-hacks
in the room looking baffled as to why
they bothered turning up just to col-
lect a piece of paper, well apart from
the food and drink of course! The non
hacks in the room, once receiving their
certificates, proceeded to the back of
the room, picked up a bottle of wine
and swiftly left the room, mush to the
disapproval of the spotty faced gimps
sitting in the Union Dining Hall.
Although this is traditionally a cer-
emony where hacks congratulate each
other, this was the first time that a
hack managed to congratulate himself!
Ray Charles, current RCSU President,
awarded himself RCSU Fellowship for
“outstanding service to the RCSU and
keeping the RCSU performing better
and better each year. [Dave] has been
awesome keeping the RCSU going, and
supporting me/science challenge very
strongly.”
This is literally a chase of giving
yourself a pat on the back!
If you want to stop this sort of
stuff happening, then make sure
you nominate people for the
award next year!

The world beyond
college walls
Next week the UK Par-
liament will elect a new
speaker to the House of
Commons.
Usually the speaker is
elected after a new Par-
liament has formed fol-
lowing a general election,
and the current speaker
Michael Martin has re-
tained his post since 2000.
But following unprece-
dented scenes last month
when MPs were openly
calling for his resignation
over the ongoing expens-
es scandal, Mr Martin an-
nounced he was standing down on 21 June.
This week hustings took place between 10 candidates as they put forward
differing programmes for creatively reforming parliament and wider parlia-
mentary culture, which has been called by one candidate “profoundly old-
fashioned, male and frequently boorish”. The speaker should theoretically
be politically neutral and be above party politics, which is partly why MPs
will vote in a secret ballot.
The deep rooted corruption over claiming expenses has shocked not just
Britons, but many around the world. This is because the UK Parliament –
formed in 1707 - is often considered the “Mother of Parliaments” and many
other countries have parliaments based on its “Westminster system.”

Nine million people are at risk of severe food shortages in Ethiopia, as
the UN runs out of food aid.
The UN’s World Food Program distributes the food to Ethiopia’s poorest,
who are hugely dependent on it for their sustenance. The UN says further
supplies are not expected to arrive for another five months. Landlocked
Ethiopia lies in Eastern Africa, and relies on the neighbouring country of
Djibouti for its supply line, but Djibouti’s port is overflowing and congested.
The next three months in Ethiopia are usually the hardest of the year, as
farmers await the harvesting season in September. The government is said
to have prioritized imports of fertilizers to increase the harvest. The Ethio-
pian ambassador to the UK has said that his country is not facing a food
crisis, and that food was being delivered by truck from Sudan.

The results of last Fri-
day’s elections in Iran
have sparked huge rallies
in the capital Tehran.
The incumbent, Presi-
dent Mahmoud Ah-
madinejad, won almost
63%of the vote, while his
main opposition rival Mir-
Hossein Mousavi garnered
34%. Voter turnout was
staggeringly high, at 85%
of the voting population.
Alleged voting irregu-
larities reported by the op-
position party, have since
triggered protests in the capital Tehran. Over the course of the week the
protests have grown larger, and more violent, resulting in the deaths of at
least eight people in clashes with the police. Supporters of Mahmoud Ah-
madinejad have also staged protests in the capital, with masses of people
coming in from the countryside, where most of his support base resides.
While international observers have urged restraint and are waiting to see
how the situation develops, Iran’s media has been censored, foreign jour-
nalists have been banned, and protest leaders have been arrested. The Su-
preme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is actually the head of state, has
called for unity, and is expected to make a pivotal speech at Friday afternoon
prayers on 19 June.

For the first time in years, first and sec-
ond year Materials have had all of their
exams squashed into one week. You
may think ‘that’s not so bad – Materi-
als people took a soft option anyway,
why are they complaining?’
For second years, it was Bad. Last
year, the exams were spread out over a
couple of weeks at the beginning of the
third term, then a fairly hardcore, but
relaxed case study with a final report
and presentation worth 30% of the fi-
nal coursework grade due in the last
few weeks of term. They could put in
as much or as little effort as they liked,
without having to worry about wheth-
er or not it would affect their exam re-
sults as well.
Not so this year. With the case study
deadline two days before the exams
started, the time that most students
felt was necessary to complete the
coursework to a satisfactory standard
was distinctly lacking. Revision was
fraught with the worry that the case
study wouldn’t be handed in on time
or up to scratch.
Friday (deadline day) came and went,
and they entered their exam week.
Maths on Monday, the exam lots of
people were most worried about be-
cause everyone knows that maths isn’t
about revision – it’s about practice.
The exam itself went pretty smoothly,
there were a few minor mistakes, eve-
ryone came out tired, pissed off (in
some cases) and ready for the next
round.
Chemistry on Tuesday – everything
went smoothly, though there was some
worry about a question in Section B,
which came up with an answer that
had a magnitude that seemed unrea-
sonable. A question was raised, the lec-
turers came back with a new value for
a constant that had changed from 10-1
to 10-17. Values were recalculated,
and an even worse order of magnitude
came out. The constant was checked

with massive epic fail
De La Beche
again. It was actually 10-1.
Wednesday was Mechanics. Matri-
ces question, which some people spent
literally hours working on – in one
case an entire exam booklet was filled
with working out. Somebody raised a
query and the lecturer responsible for
the question came and changed a value
in the paper which changed the whole
matrix from asymmetric to symmet-
ric. People who asked for extra time
were denied it, despite the fact that the
question had been completely impos-
sible and the error was corrected rela-
tively late into the exam.
Microstructure and Properties was
approached on Thursday, with every-
one thoroughly sick and tired of ex-
ams, and hoping for a better day with
the exam papers. It wasn’t flawless –
there were a couple of misprints but
nothing major and everyone came out
looking forward to the last day of ex-
ams (if not for the exam, for the drink-
ing afterwards!)
Was it too much to hope that Phys-
ics on Friday would be a perfect paper?
Most people certainly thought so as
they sat down and started to write the
paper, but it quickly became apparent
that this exam was EASY. The answers
were easy to find, it was almost as if
they had been thought about previ-
ously and come straight to mind. The
more observant realised the obvious
truth long before the admin did.
So when the head exams dude
walked into the exam room and an-
nounced that the paper was the wrong
one, you can imagine the atmosphere
in the room. Instead of managing to
print this year’s paper, last year’s pa-
per had been given to them; hence the
‘easiness’ of it. Everyone was kicked
out and told to come back at eleven to
start 2009’s paper. Imagine it for a mo-
ment. You’re writing possibly the easi-
est exam of your life and had a bitch of
a week. You’re maybe half an hour off
finishing, and are looking forward to a
quiet pint in the union, already imag-
ining the freedom. Suddenly, you find
out that no, it’s not the right paper, you
have to start again.
You have to ask some questions
about this. How hard is it to check the
paper you’ve printed is for the right
year? And if it isn’t, how does it take
forty minutes to realise you’ve given
everyone the wrong paper? One of the
lecturers even corrected a typo in the
paper – a correction he must surely
have had to make last year. We go to
what is supposedly one of the top uni-
versities in the country – how is it pos-
sible that mistakes like this are made?
And if there are mistakes that make
questions impossible to answer, how is
it fair that people don’t get extra time?
We’re not suggesting that they
should have let us carry on with the
exam and given high marks for those
who’d done it before, but the mistake
shouldn’t have been made in the first
place. Some of the lecturers seem to
have gone out of their way to make it
impossible to get through the end of
the year without feeling like crap at
some point, and are actually punishing
everyone. Maybe some people need
to be punished for not working hard
enough, but what about those who
have?
We would like to see a significant im-
provement next year across the board
for all Materials (bear in mind the cur-
rent second year gave feedback which
improved the first year for this year’s
Fresher’s – where was the feedback
that improved it for us??) and hope
that these circumstances will be taken
into account when they give us our
grades.
