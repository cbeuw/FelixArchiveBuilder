Lolcat of teh week
Happy New Year! If anything, the start
of 2012 has proven to be pretty dense
with news. Despite the number of people
allegedly doing their exams, we’ve
somehow ended up with the biggest
News Section of the academic year. But
of course, we always need more roving
reporters on the prowl around campus,
not to mention photographers. And
writers. And illustrators. Come to think of
it, if you’re interested in giving us a hand
in any way, go ahead! We’re always on the
lookout for keen individuals, and we’re a
friendly bunch. Editor

PICK OF THE WEEK
It’s a new year, so why not join
Felix?
A regular office occurence
Part time ‘nanny’, required in W14
Nanny required in West Kensington to look af-
ter our 16 month old son, 5 mornings a week,
8.00am – midday, though there is some flexibil-
ity in the hours. The position would suit a stu-
dent as we only need help during term times.
We are looking for someone with the right
attitude, (ie loving, baby centred, curious, flexi-
ble) rather than lots of previous experience and
qualifications. Cooking and some light house-
work to do with our son (not general cleaning
etc) will also be required.
You will need an excellent standard of spoken
English and will need to provide two character
references (from the UK). You will also need to
apply for an enhanced CRB check if offered the
position.
We are in the process of establishing a home
care company, so there might be training and
other care work available in future.
£8.50 per hour
Please phone 07769 908 468 if you meet all
of the above requirements.
