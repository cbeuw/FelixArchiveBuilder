After removal from the committee in

In December it was confirmed that the
Union would be invited to return.

We revamped the Union Blogging
System to make the work of Your
Sabbaticals more transparent (and
contactable). Over 8,000 of you have
read their blogs.

We acquired new (and safer) benches,
repaved and replaced the bins to make
the Quad a more enjoyable area. The
bike racks are being improved at the

Our lobbying encouraged college to
apply film to all windows which should
see a reduction of around 6 degrees
Celsius during the summer months.

The Union has attended four meetings of
the Aldwych Group and visited Germany

local Councillors and representatives from
national bodies. We responded to the
White Paper on Higher Education as well as
UCAS and QAA consultations.

We began the process of moving out
financial systems online; allowing for
rapid payment of our members and a
lower workload for club treasurers.

We introduced a range of low-coast
everyday essential items in the Union
Shop. We will continue to ensure you
can get the stationery you need at the
best possible prices.

place on campus to relax after a hard
day’s study. In October alone we sold

burgers!
Remember, the most important part of Imperial College Union is you!
