Completing the NSS is essential to all parts of the College e.g. Last yearâ€™s data was used by
the Union to create the â€˜NSS Responseâ€™, a document which is helping improve the student
experience across the whole college.
To help make the survey as useful as possible we have a few tips to those who have yet to
complete it:
1. Rate your entire degree, not your final year.
The NSS is very different to SOLE. Use SOLE to discuss the positives and negatives of your
year and NSS for the positives and negatives of your whole degree.
2. Donâ€™t be neutral.
On many questions you will get these options: Definitely Disagree = 1, Mostly Disagree = 2,
Neither Agree nor Disagree = 3, Mostly Agree = 4, Definitely Agree = 5.
Neutral responses give us no indication as to whether things need improving or are going
very well. Make your voice count.
3. Give detailed comments on open
text boxes
There are free-text boxes on the
survey. Be as detailed as possible if
you want to make an impact.
