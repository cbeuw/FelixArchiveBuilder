Imperial
Eagles held by
Great Danes
Have you ever felt that tension, that
awareness that to achieve your goal you
will have to fight and exceed your own
limits? On the day of the most impor-
tant match of the season the Imperial
Eagles felt exactly that way.
The Eagles were about to play the
second team of the English first divi-
sion handball champion: Great Dane,
the most titled team in the UK. Many
of those first division players play also
in the second division but to the Eagles
this was not important. “Imperial! What
is your profession? Augh Augh Augh!”
Let the match begin!
The early stages of the game saw a
solid Great Dane taking the lead on the
Eagles who seemed shy in defense and
attack. But on the 4-7, just when Great
Dane was getting confident the Eagles
struck back and scored 4 goals taking
the 8-7 lead with mighty shots from
left-back veteran Lucas Carlsten and
right-back Max Flashback.
The Eagles were now in control and
had their fate in their own hands (lit-
erally). The game proceeded with the
Eagles leading by 1 or 2 goals until
a yellow card to Lucas Carsten and a
penalty offered Great Dane the equal-
izer. Perfect set-up for Great Dane
right? You might think. Not when the
goal-keeper is handball legend Stefan
Bauer! Stefan Bauer, also known as
Snakey B., saved the penalty and the
Eagles maintained the lead. By half-
time, line-player and club president
Kolja Ortmann (Papa Bear as he likes
to call himself) and left-back Yannick
Seis had secured a 12-10 lead for the
Eagles. “Hot jets of man-steam” from
the Eagles!
As soon as the second half whistle
echoed in cold Leyton hall, Great Dane
began an aggressive defense policy. The
Eagles offered a couple of counter at-
tacks but maintained the lead. This time
goals come from centre players Charles
Magne and Kristof and a couple by the
right wing signed Ruben Freytag. Left
wing player and club captain Roberto
Galli, elected more for his partying
skills and outstanding physical beauty
rather than handball talent, also scored
a couple of important goals.
The Eagles’ Greek keeper Mega Al-
exandros, who is believed to descend
directly from Alexander the Great
himself, saved some tough shots and
helped keeping the Eagles 2 or 3 goals
up. At 5 minutes to the end of the game,
with a five goal lead (23-18) the Eagles
were about to make history and set a
new standard for English Handball
Second Division.
Despite all this, just when you think
you can start heading for a warm show-
er and are already planning to grab
some cheap celebratory lager from
Tesco, that’s when you get punished (or
bifflé as you say in French)! Complete
madness and unmentionable handball
from the Eagles allowed Great Dane
to climb back to reach a final score of
25-25. Sacrebleu! What a shame! All
in all, a draw is a good result and the
Eagles proved capable of great hand-
ball… but this draw really does taste
like defeat!
