The Hangman guide to exams
1. Cheat.
2. Convince someone less subtle than
you to cheat. Use them as a sacrificial
lamb. When they get caught, it will
cause a distraction. You can then cheat
like a motherfucker who’s fucking a
married mother while his girlfriend is
in the other room. Oh yeah.
3. Press the books to your head. Osmo-
sis works like that doesn’t it, biologists?
You may need to get a good friend to
lick your forehead first.
4. Spend all day on Facebook, Twitter
and Google+. Just kidding, spend all
day on Facebook and Twitter. Why?
This seems like it’s not going to help
you in exams? Well, those bikini pic-
tures aren’t going to perv over them-
selves are they? Plus, it’s definitely go-
ing to help you out in a computational
Exams with double digit amounts of lecture courses, lab reports, constant deadlines: I
guess campus food isn’t the only thing that leaves you swallowing a shit sandwich
S
o, after a week of of bat-
tering your stomach and
liver with mince pies and
wine, cold temperatures
and close quarters with
family there’s a good chance you’ve
come down with some sort of ill-
ness. There you thought your immune
system had perfected itself after you
recovered from Fresher’s flu. News-
flash, Wolverine: it’s more akin to
Norton Antivirus - it barely works,
needs updating all the time and needs
all the help it can get.
If you’ve fallen ill on a weekend
when your GP isn’t available, too
fucking bad - your body isn’t keeping
track of the days. Trot down to your
local A&E where you might wait ages
because it’s full of hypochrondriacs
who’ve mistaken a hangover for men-
exam. Right?
5. Don’t under any circumstances try to
listen to rap music while revising. Hav-
ing someone brag about how great they
are at everything, how much money,
cars and women they have, and how
things are easy for them isn’t helpful
for morale.
6. Disrupt the exam hall by carrying out
a feasibility study on it. It’s only a mat-
ter of time until catering start to do it.
7. Burst into tears fifteen minutes into
the exam, citing post-traumatic stress
syndrome harking back to when your
grandmother died five years ago. Be
prepared to kill your grandmother for
the sake of authenticity (or fake a death
certificate).

Don’t get ill
You’re a student. You don’t know how to look after yourself when you’re healthy, let alone when
you’re too fatigued to even have a wank

8. Tattoo equations on your thighs. It
may make you look like a weirdo in
the exam but a. you get an excuse to
take your trousers off in public and b.
you pass. Better save this technique for
summer, though.
9. Sneak into your lecturer’s room and
replace his shirt with one that has all the
notes written on it. He’ll notice when
he looks in the mirror? Yeah, because
Imperial lecturers are all so appearance
orientated. Your only problem is if he
realises he’s not wearing the same thing
as the day before.
10. Make up rap songs to remember
stuff:
E = mc motherfucking squared bitch,
Now I’m done with relativity now
here’s the hitch,
Quantum mechanics is like my dick
In that it’s thick, hard and incredibly
long,
The main difference is that a lot of
bitches study my penis while wearing
a thong.
11. Don’t make rap songs. They just
turn out a bit misogynistic and go off
topic. Besides, you’re not Eminem.

A thrilling chance to measure

Don’t say we don’t take care
of you.
ingitis or dipshits who broke their fist
when they got into fight with a brick
wall. Or, you could just go to a clinic
and get seen by a locum shipped in
from the deepest recesses of some 2nd
world country, who’s only working as
a doctor on New Year’s Eve because
he’s too shit to get a job as a real GP.
Just don’t complain if suddenly your
sore throat becomes lymphoma and
accusations of homosexuality begin
to fly on the basis of some rash on
your face. Locums are the Frankie
Boyles of the medicine world. Once
he’s done with you you’ll wish he’ll
overprescribe you with Tramadol.
With any luck, you’ll either last
until you can see a proper doctor or
you go to the hospital. Either way,
it’s finally time for a dose of modern
medicine to fix you right up. What do
you mean, antibiotics don’t work on
viruses? I have to just get loads of rest
of keep hydrated? Beer doesn’t count
for hydration?
Shit sucks because you still have
coursework to do and waving a glan-
dular fever diagnosis around isn’t go-
ing to help because you’ll just be told
you should’ve done the work before
you got ill, anticipating that this is the
most likely time to get sick.

you looking for? This
isn’t the Da Vinci
Code”
