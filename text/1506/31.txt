On Friday 25 November, 11 of Impe-
rial College discDoctors’ finest men
embarked on a campaign to compete
against the other 15 best university in-
door teams in the country. It was the
weekend of Open Indoor Nationals and
it carried the potential for discDoctors
(dD) to earn some BUCS points for Im-
perial College.
dD’s first pool game on Saturday
morning saw them facing the Man-
chester team, Halcyon. It proved to be
a tough start against clinical opposi-
tion resulting in a 6-8 defeat. Oxford’s
team, OW!, provided dD with their sec-
ond game. After losing the first game
dD wanted this one bad and came out
with a fluid and organised offense. It
was enough to claim an 8-6 win over
the Champions of the Midlands region.
The final pool game saw dD face Blaze
from Sterling University. Imperial’s fin-
est eventually won the game 6-5 by a
gritty sudden-death point. Next up for
discDoctors grab BUCS points
dD were two power pool games, the
first against Trinity College Dublin.
dD’s constantly improving defence saw
a lot of pressure placed on the Dublin-
ers causing numerous turnovers and
propelling Imperial to a comfortable
win. The last game on Saturday saw
dD take on Skunks from Southamp-
ton in the toughest game of the week-
end. Skunk’s team had a lofty average
height and they managed to use this to
their advantage with an impressive long
game. After a full day of Ultimate dD
carried out classic tournament tradition
and went for a team curry, complete
with Chinese whispers in German!
discDoctors entered Sunday in 11th
position and started the day with a
crossover match against the team in
6th place, Haze from Loughborough. If
Imperial won this game they’d be pro-
pelled into 6th place. dD came into this
game fired up and with all guns blazing
scoring a few points on the trot. When
Haze finally woke up from their reverie,
it was all a bit too late for a comeback
giving dD a 6-3 win. This result put Im-
perial in the Top 8. The next match was
a quarter finals game against the very
physical team of Blaze from Dundee.
dD had ups and downs in a very tight
contest that saw Blaze come out on top
through clinical and organised play to
clinch a 6-8 victory. The penultimate
matchup was against Sublime of Ports-
mouth University. This too proved to be
a very tight game with both teams try-
ing to slow each other down using zone
defence. As both sides knew each other
too well, zone proved a futile choice
with the respective zones being worked
through extremely patiently. Sublime
managed to come out on top with a 5-7
victory. The final game of the tourna-
ment saw Imperial facing off once
again with OW! It was a match that
could have ended either way with the
balance tipped in OW!’s favour result-
ing in a 7-9 loss.
After two days and nine intense
games of Ultimate, Imperial discDoc-
tors ended their Open Indoor National
campaign in 8th position, with their first
ever BUCS points for Imperial College.
