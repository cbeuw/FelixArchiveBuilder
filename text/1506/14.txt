The rumoured closure of the Holland Club
has seen an immense response from the
College community. From staff to post-
graduate students, the actions of Col-
lege with regards to its feasibility study
have been watched ever closely since
rumours of a possible closure surfaced
over last term. Could the severity of such
a campaign, employing a sizeable Face-
book page, make a change to the study
and potentially, the future of the Holland
Club?
The College has clearly been paying at-
tention to the opinions that have been
generated by the Facebook group. On
Wednesday an announcement on the
Imperial College website called for feed-
back and input into the feasibility study,
considering such areas as “what addi-
tional catering and amenities would best
serve the needs of staff and students
on the South Kensington campus” and
“how the ethos of the Holland Club might
be maintained within any new facilities”.
The resulting comments continue the
great deal of worry from patrons of the
bar as already expressed on the Face-
book group.
How the College proceeds with the fea-
sibility study will, of course, be affected
by the sheer number of people who have
taken to the relative channels to express
their opinions over the rumoured plans.
Hundreds of campaigners will doubtless
be studying the issue with keen inter-
est, which College cannot simply ignore.
Any conclusions from the study must be
able to withstand the heaviest of scru-
tiny if they are to be accepted by the
community.
The Holland Club is not a stranger to
potential closure, with Felix reporting in
June 1995 on its then-financial difficul-
ties. Nearly seventeen years on, and un-
der whole new circumstances many have
taken it upon themselves to fight for its
continued existence, which is, at the
very least, a testament to its popularity
amongst staff and indeed students.
As the coming days bring more news of
the College’s conclusions into the study,
the campaign is likely to grow ever larger.
Indeed, some patrons have even been
considering events such as a sit-in in or-
der to express their feelings. Regardless
of the outcome, there’s no denying that
the supporters of the Holland Club are
ready and prepared to fight their case
whatever the case may be.

All it takes is a little
Dutch courage
S
ince the government cut
funding for higher educa-
tion and Undergraduate
fees were forced up, much
has been speculated about
the corresponding rise in Postgradu-
ate fees. Though technically the fund-
ing from the Government for Post-
graduate fees was also cut, since it is
lumped in with the total Undergradu-
ate teaching grant it is hard to prise
them apart and the two may in fact be
inseparable. Across the country, we
began to hear of price rises for Mas-
ters courses. The UK average is cur-
rently a 24% increase and as a student
I had heard nothing from the College,
the Union or Felix about any rises at
Imperial until a lecturer remarked that
they were going up to £9000. I decid-
ed to investigate.
The Imperial website is a good
place to start, but the course fees in
the Postgraduate prospectus are still
those from 2011/12. You would think
from this that the fees for this year’s
entry have yet to be decided, but this
is far from the truth. The fees are in
fact published on the Registry section
of the website. Why they haven’t been
changed in the prospectus is beyond
me. Having a closer look reveals a
very strange system of increases. A lot
of courses have not gone up at all, or
have just gone up with inflation. Med-
icine is a good example of this. There
are a few increasing at the national
average such as Bioengineering and
Computing at 25% and 22% respec-
tively. Whether this is justified or not
is still a point of contention. Another
strange side of the Registry figures is
that, next to the 2012/13, they list the
‘2011/12 figure’; the problem is that
these figures are frequently wrong, as
anyone can see by comparing the Reg-
istry page with the prospectus.
Then comes the shocker: the suite
of 19 Life Sciences Masters de-
grees, which have had their costs
increased by 78.2% from £5050 to
£9000. Why?! Yet again, since the
Union didn’t know about this, and we
haven’t seen anything from College,
I’m going to make some assumptions
based on how I understand the system.
If these are wrong then I welcome
clarification. It is time that this was
challenged though, as I know from an
academic, whose name I won’t men-
tion, that these fee rises were known
about in September.
Imperial as a University sets a
‘baseline’ Masters cost which is the
minimum anyone will have to pay.
The College baseline is (from what I
can work out on the Registry website)
£3825. From then on the Faculties
can decide to increase this by how-
ever much they want, as there is no
government cap on Masters fees. The
Departments and Course Directors ap-
parently have no power over the price
of their courses. The Faculty of Natu-
ral Sciences has therefore decided to
increase these fees. What are the pos-
sible reasons for this? Fee s can in-
crease for four reasons: to dramatical-
ly increase the quality of the course,
to cover some new costs, to replace
lost funding from another source (as
with Undergraduate fees) or to pro-
vide bursaries. I cannot see how any
of these reasons can be justified here.
An increase in the quality or costs of
the course would surely be something
the Course Directors have an influ-
ence over and so they subsequently
would advise that the fee would have
to go up. But Course Directors were
told how much their fees would have
to increase by the Faculty, which has
no role in the quality or running costs
of individual courses.
The drop in funding from another
source could correspong to the reduc-
tion in the government teaching grant.
But if this is being taken into account
then we should see an equal increase
across all Masters courses, which
we do not. Regarding bursaries for
postgraduates, I have heard rumours
but nothing concrete. More bursaries
would be welcome, but surely if this
is the reason for the increase then it
still doesn’t explain why such a large
increase is happening in such a tar-
Mystery over Masters fee
rises

geted way.
What effect will this have? There
is little support from the government
and the University, who provide for
a select few very needy and intel-
ligent students doing Masters. Most
students have either saved up for the
course and accommodation costs or
have the Professional Development
Loan, a commercial loan provided by
either Barclays or the Co-op for up to
£10,000. Though this is commercial,
the government pays the interest dur-
ing your time of study, but you have
to begin paying it back, whether you
have a job or not, within a month
of finishing. Fair enough, you may
say. The problem arises because this
£10,000 maximum amount is not set
to increase. Masters fee increases,
when not combined with loan in-
creases, simply price people out com-
pletely. This is not just a case of more
debt but of a simple inability to pay.
Imperial has also now introduced a
deposit system for Masters – 10% as
soon as you accept your place. Many
people cannot afford to pay £900 sev-
eral months before getting any loan or
financial assistance.
The financial reasons for this and
the potential solutions have yet to be
thrashed out. What is unacceptable
is Imperial’s secrecy over these fee
rises. It is bizarre that no one seems
to know about this and it isn’t being
talked about. Course costs should be
transparent. The Faculty of Natural
Sciences needs to explain why it has
imposed a 78% rise on 19 Masters
when costs for other Masters in the
College have remained the same or
gone up by only a few percent. Other
Faculties should also explain any rises
above inflation. The College needs to
explain why some Masters are going
up and some not, and whether or not
it sees this as fair. That the fee rises
were decided by September and yet
the Postgraduate prospectus has, to
date, not been updated is unaccept-
able.
