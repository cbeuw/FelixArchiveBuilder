SLITHERLINK
The aim with Slitherlink is to make
one continuous closed loop by con-
necting the dots. The numbers in each
square indicate how many edges of
the square are part of the loop, so if it
contains a “2”, you know that two and
only two out of four edges have lines.
That’s all the info you need to get the
one logical answer (though waiting a
week to see the solution will also do).

Wordoku
The almighty Wordoku is back from its Christmas break, ready to
provide you with an even more inconsequential solution to exam-
induced boredom.
The traditional Wordoku has every row, column and 3x3 box con-
taining one letter each. The end result is a rather useless word or
phrase that appears in one of the rows or columns. You’ll need to
finish the entire grid for credit, though.
So basically, it’s like a Sudoku, but with letters instead of numbers.
Thrilling revelations, right there.
As usual, answers to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk (and that goes
for the maze above too). Answers mean points, and points mean
prizes. Check out the FUCWIT leader board to the right for more

HELP US SOLVE THE ULTIMATE PROBLEM
Do you eat these puzzles for breakfast? I’d get that checked
out. But I digress.
If you’d like to contribute to our illustrious section by sending in
your own puzzles or comics, email puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
But perhaps you want to go one step further? If you’d like to
try your hand at editing these pages, let us know! Send us an
email or come down to the Felix Office in the West Basement of
Beit Quad to test your mettle.
We were originally going to have a
normal scribble box here, but see-
ing as it’s a new year we decided to
go one step further. For no obvious
reason other than furthering his cur-
rent media exposure, here’s a picture
of trained thespian Benedict Cumber-
batch. The individual who makes the
best addition to the box will be richly
rewarded. Probably. Get drawing, you
know, if that’s your kind of thing. Im-
ages to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Maze Entrance/Escape (depending on how you feel)
The Felix University/College-
Wide Invitational Tournament
League is, as ever, new and
improved, with prizes for both
the winning team and the win-
ning individual.
Points are awarded for each
puzzle solved, double if you’re
the first correct solution.
As it’s a new year, why not
go ahead and aim for the big
time? If you’re determined to
win, you could rack up some
serious points.
Send your solutions to puzzles.
