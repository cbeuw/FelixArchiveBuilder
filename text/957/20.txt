Taken from Henry James' classic
tale of ghosts and hysteria. Britten's
chamber opera (libretto by My
Fanwy Piper) concerns the arrival
of a young woman (Valerie
Masterson) at the country house
Bly, there to act as governess to two
children, Miles (Samuel Burkey)
and Flora (Megan Kelly) in the
absence of their estranged guardian.
But her appearance uncovers (or
perhaps precipitates) the terrifying
decline of the children towards evil,
and finally possession.
Where James' novel hinted that
the source of the evil could be
hysterical children and a neurotic
governess. Britten's interpretation
is very much that of the
supernatural—a battle between good
and evil. The music, fifteen
complex variations of a single
twelve note pattern, creates such a
Felix 957
variation of moods that the
emotional extremes of the story are
almost casually mirrored. Here,
conducted by James Holmes, the
performances of the central
characters are exceptional—notably
Philip Langridge as the ghost Peter
Quint and Megan Kelly's Coliseum
debut as Flora. Her portrayal of a
young girl dragged into evil has a
melevolent sexuality that is
decidedly creepy. Langridge's
Quint, seemingly desperate to
control Miles, and battling with the
governess for the boy's soul, is
absolutely haunting.
With an almost minimalist stage
set which makes contrasting uses of
both projection and shadow,
Jonathan Miller's production (here
revised from its last performance in
1991 by David Ritch) splendidly
captures the essence of what is,
after all, a damn good ghost story.

The two respected recitalists came
together to give us a programme
spanning a century of violin and
piano repertoire. Unfortunately Mr
Maisenberg had sustained a
mysterious injury prior to the
concert forcing a change of
programming, shunning Schubert's
Rondo Brilliant and Bart6k's 2nd
Sonata in preference to Schubert's
2nd Sonatine and two works from
the Second Viennese School. We
were, however, treated to three
splendid encores. Gidon Kremer's
eleoquence and sonorous tone were
breath-taking, but somewhat
marred by his tendency to go
'walkabout' whilst performing,
slightly akin to Nigel Kennedy
(well, nothing like Nigel Kennedy
really, thank god) which was both
visually and acoustically offputting.
Oleg Maisenberg's accompaniment
was both sensitive and individual,
and my heart went out to him as he
hobbled off and back onto the
platform after each number,
obviously in great pain.

Rigoletto
The end of the first act; the cast take
a breather, the stage hands rush to
change the extraordinary set, and
the audience fumble for their
programmes to try and work out
just what the hell is going on. Well,
it seems clear that our hunchbacked
hero Rigoletto (complete with hump
and outrageous limp) has been
cursed by Monterone, and blatantly
obvious that he's keeping a mistress
locked up at home (or is it his
daughter?). But who is Ceprano and
why is everyone so keen to kidnap
his wife? Is the 'Duke' only after
cheap tricks with Maddalena, or is
he really in love with Gilda? What
with all of the above and Sparafucile
(the assassin, what else?) making
assignations all over the place, you
tend to get a bit confused and, only
occasionally, lose the gist.
However, these are mere cursory
details—the music is fantastic; a
superficially a very simple piece for
both violinist and pianist, exploited
the intrinsically song-like character
of the greatest song-writer of the
mid-nineteenth century. This lyrical
style, oddly, continued in the pieces
of Webern and his mentor,
Shcoenberg, feeling rather out of
place where a more brash, coarse
tone would have been more apt.
The second half brought 19th
century works for Schullhof,
Dvorak and Liszt; fireworks after
the calm of the first three pieces.
The sublimely intense writing of
Schullhof (who perished in the
concentration camps of the Second
World War) and Dvorak were a
wonderful contrast to the clinical
H H
dark, brooding overture, frenetic
changes in pace, and wonderfully
depressing ending. Sometimes the
orchestra (under the direction of
Mark Elder) seem to overpower the
performers, but this gives you
ample excuse for missing the plot.
The sets (designed by Patrick
Robertson and Rosemary Verco)
are breathtaking. The production
has placed the events in the New
York Mafia society of the 1950s,
and whenever the curtains lift, the
audience sit up. The key characters
are performed with vigour and an
infusion of real excitement, notably
Jonathan Summers as Rigletto and
Rosa Manian as Gilda. This is true
opera—tragedy, comedy and
bloody good music.

Webern and were played with gay
abandon (if that is still PC) and no
little degree of raunchiness when
required, mirrored with very
private moments when one hardly
dared to breathe (although certain
members of the audience still
managed to cough to the profound
annoyance of me, and half the
audience, I suspect). The climax
was reached with the Liszt Grand
Duo Concertant, a warhorse for
both performers, brilliantly
executed with sensitivity and
panache.
