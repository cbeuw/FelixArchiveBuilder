Hibiscus thanks
Dear Jonty,
Foremost, on behalf of the
Malaysian Night Committee, I
would like to thank all participants,
sponsors and friends of the
Malaysian Society, who have in one
way or another, helped to make the
'Hibiscus Evening' a success.
The 'Hibiscus Evening' is
believed to have fulfilled its
objectives, among others, to foster
an appreciation of the Malaysian
identity, by means of promoting the
country's diverse ethnic cultures.
To nurture more interactions and
bring about better understanding,
we have taken the initiative to invite
parties of various interests, both
within and outside IC, political and
non-political alike, to join us in the
'Hibiscus Evening', by ways of
complimentary tickets.
Speaking from the Malaysian
Society's point of view, the
'Hibiscus Evening' has brought
together most members, cultivated
and strengthened the friendships
among one another.
The 'Hibiscus Evening' could be
seen from a different angle. We
represent the lucky few who have
been provided with the
opportunities to study abroad, and
are constantly aware of the welfare
of the less fortunate. To make it
even more meaningful and
memorable, we have volunteered to
contribute a significant amount of
any profit made (balances unclear
at the time of writing) to selected
charities, both of this country and
Malaysia.
To conclude, the Malaysian
Society has come a long way, right
from the formulation of concepts to
the realisation of the 'Hibiscus
Evening'. Once again, my utmost
gratitude to the working committee,
backstage crews, and men and
women who have put on their
traditional garments, some
undoubtedly for the very first time.
Yours sincerely,
HMKho,
Chairman, Malaysian Night
Committee.

Find me a place where the sun never sets
Dear Jonty,
It is some time since I have
written to Felix but after reading the
letter last week from the cowardly
Crocky I felt I must put pen to paper
and respond to this badly written
piece of drivel. I say cowardly since
this person doesn't even have the
guts to sign his/her real name.
He/she is obviously ashamed, quite
understandably, of the inaccurate
and curious arguments, let's take
the points in turn.
Crocky goes on about how the
monarchy does not provide any
identity to this, or Commonwealth,
countries. Not being a Royalist
myself I am not bothered about his
criticisms of the monarchy.
His curious references to
Britain's part in world history do
however bother me, not just
because he is wrong on a number
of issues. When British forces left
colonial territories yes there were
troubles, but can't he see that it was
the very fact British forces were
there that kept peace and stability
for many of the preceding years?
He also makes reference to
World War II. Nobody in the world
can criticise Britain's role in this
war. People like him are an
embarrassment to the memory of
the many brave men and women
who laid down their lives for the
freedom of the world. He should be
given a white feather.
Another point he made regarding
the creation of '...several new
countries hating one another guts.'
This again he blames on the British.
At least Crocky is consistent. This
is the same rubbish that he spouts
throughout the entire letter. The
reason why there are troubles in the
Middle East, Ireland and the Indian
sub-continent is due to Mad
Mullahs, terrorist scum and
religious fanatics.
One of the most extraordinary
claims is '...we may not even
understand the recent war with
Argentina'. What are you on? The
reason is simple. Our boys kicked
out a bunch of jumped-up Argies
who invaded British sovereign
territory. We had an obligation to
protect the British dependants living
there.
Still he keeps spewing s*** like
a broken sewage pipe. The
European Community is the next
issue he turns his ignorance to. It
was a sad day when we joined the
Community, but now we're in it we
must attempt to stop the ludicrous
directives. We must also attempt to
scupper M r Delors plans of a united
Europe. Unfortunately M r Major,
unlike his predecessor, is not able
to do this.
Crocky then writes '...try to
rebuild Britain through positive
aspects.' This, after a whole letter
slagging off Britain—in particular
it turns out the English.
He finally slags off all those who
he thinks support the monarchy.
One of the categories was '...beer
drinking bogroll newspaper
readers.' By this I have been told
he means certain tabloids—the most
popular newspapers in the whole of
the country. By this snobbish and
superior attitude he just confirms
the view that many decent people
would already have of him. That he
suffers from the British disease,
commonly held by the middle-class
intelligentsia chattering classes,
who tell ordinary blokes like myself
how to think. They can't wait to put
our country down at every
opportunity and look down on the
vast majority of British people He
is an undesirable element who has
no place in this country.
Yours as ever,
Alan Bailey.
P.S. I refer to Crocky as he
because no female could write such
rubbish.
