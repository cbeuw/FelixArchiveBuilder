Arrogant 4ths
University of London,
Upper Reserve Cup Quarter Final
Imperial IV 4—1 St Georges II
Imperial College Association
Football Club is blessed with total
kwality in the form of this year's
fourth team who approached the
University of London upper reserve
cup quarter final with the resolve
and tenacity never before seen in
college soccer.
Strangely the arrogance of the
fourth team didn't deter St Georges
from gaining an initial advantage
after an uncharacteristic slip-up by
goalkeeper Greatorex. However IC
bounced straight back, scoring
almost immediately with a well
worked move from defence,
through midfield onto R Snell and
J Diss and finally crossed by A Said
to be crusted home by N Strevens.
A second goal from IC followed 10
minutes later resulting from a quick
throw, from new boy K Burrett, to
Said who buried clinically. One, of
course, thinks back to the midfield
hustle by D Buckle to ensure the
throw.
The second half continued in the
same euphoric vain with Diss
converting our relentless pressure
into points, additionally opening his
account for IC, with a text book
header from a pin-point corner.
One, of course, thinks back to the
midfield hustle by D Buckle to
ensure the corner. The game
progressed from this point with IC
consolidating in defence assisted by
fine performances from A Gelli and
K Otikoju who were both new to the
full back positions. Crunching
tackles were prevalent in midfield
and were complemented perfectly
with the ability and vision of M
Dikko and K Burrett up front.
Once IC held their death grip
there was never going to be any
escape for St Georges. The final
nail in their coffin was a fourth goal
beautifully converted by Said from
a fine through-ball by one of the old
hands, R Ramachandran. The final
whistle blew before the game could
be restarted.
Surely after this performance no
one can fancy getting IC in the
semi-final draw, and we face this
penultimate game with the
unquestioned inevitability of
preceding to Motspur Park for the
final. One, of course, looks to D
Buckle to ensure that destiny is
assured.
First Results
The Imperial College Indoor
Football Tournament (IC 1ST)
started this week. The opening
games proved to be very exciting
with good football played by all the
teams. Special mention must go to
the Pakistani forward (very thin, but
very nimble) who was instrumental
in the defeat of the Lebanese team.
The results so far are given below,
with next week's fixtures. Teams
are required to be at the Volleyball
Court at the times stated in Felix

Our train was kept a'rolling towards
platforms one and two for victory
at Waterloo. Yes, our League—Cup
double hopes are still alive. After
winning four out of five last league
games, this one was crucial.
Heavily depleted by injury and
desertion we entered the game like
Kurt Cobain's wardrobe—hastily
thrown together in the dark of an
unlit bedroom. Despite this, we
bloomed into an early lead as Dave
F, the goal mouth bandit stole the
ball from John F's stick to score.
We had many more shots but there
was always something in the way.
Oh well, nevermind.
We'd like to remind you that this
is the well known wild man club of
Imperial. We can also boast the
fittest women in College. With our
world tour this year beginning in
Reading (other venues to be
announced) we're having a pretty
exciting year. This Saturday is,
however, particularly exhilarating,
since our 'Hyde Park Relays' are
taking place around the Serpentine,
beginning at 2pm. This is arguably
the largest student race in Europe,
with over 1000 competitors drawn
from all the main universities in the
UK, plus teams from Dutch, French
and German universities. Sadly this
year Princess Diana is unable to
attend as 'patron of the Games' (in
fact she hasn't been able to make
it very often in previous years—
bless her)—but the race still
promises its exotic mix of foreign,
dusky and British sweat, especially
with our traditional 'drown the
foreign teams in the Serpentine'
laugh-a-minute trophy ceremony
allowing booking free travel on
most major channel ferry routes
over Sunday.
So, if you want to see the team
with worse steroid abuse than
'Neighbours' get trodden into the
ground. Come on down to the SE
end of the Serpentine at 2pm on
Saturday.

Many thankyous to the RCS players
who stood in for IC players at
Harlington on Wednesday. Poor
turn out, again, left us short before
we started. After two injuries in the
first twenty minutes we were lucky
that the Firsts opposition had not yet
arrived and a couple stood in for us
(Cheers). Half time, and loads
down, the Firsts opposition had
arrived and so 13 men turned a
brave face and showed some
determination to hold them off for
the second half. It was a
dissapointing game this far into the
season.
Imperial College Rugby meet
Mondays at 6 and Tuesdays at 12
in the Union Gym, watch the notice
board next to the Union Bar.
