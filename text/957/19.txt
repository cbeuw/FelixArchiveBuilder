It is difficult to see Joe Pesci as
anything other than Leo Getz in
Lethal Weapon or bungling thief in
Home Alone yet his talents do not
just lie in comedy. He puts in a
convincing performance as Leon
Bernstein (The Great Bernzini), a
freelance photographer who sleeps
by day in a seedy room the size of
a broom cupboard. At night he
prowls the streets of 1930s New
York listening to the police
broadcasts of crime and accidents.
His pictures are sensational to the
tabloids but more importantly first
to reach the press office. His
nocturnal activities make him a
lonely and untrusting cynic who
never wants to get involved with
what is on the other side of the lens.
Enter Barbara Hershey as the
femme fatale. He falls hopelessly in
love with her and one by one breaks
his own rules on her behalf. The
FBI take an interest in his activities
with the mafia and he uses the
situation to further his dream of
having his work published as
serious photojournalism. Leon is
based on a real photographer
Widgee and some of the
photographs used in the film are his.
The story isTiot very well paced and
at times seems to be going nowhere
yet perseverance pays off in the
end. (The use of stills and music is
very effective from director
Howard Franklin, together with the
sets and costumes help make an
atmospheric if a little slow.)

It's life, Jim, but not as we know it.

Aren't first impressions somewhat
deceiving at times? I mean, this film
has a plot most would scoff at,
trailers and press releases most
would choose only to ignore, but
no, I thought. Amongst the wafer
thin plot lies an almost irresistible
chocolate layer of a film, whipped
until smooth and fluffy, creamy and
dark yet wholly innocent. Yes that's
right this film is so stupid and crazy
it's funny.
What you get for your money is
an hour and a half of deep-throated
television satire, oh yes there is a
plot amongst all that but it soon gets
lost and forgotten as you sit almost
uncontrollably on the edge of your
comfy, soft cushioned, Spanish
inquisitionless chair, waiting for the
next piss take, seeing if you can
guess the sketch before all is
revealed.

Basically, that's what this film
becomes, a collection of Saturday
Night Live type sketches pasted
together with one of those ' M r
Couch Potato gets sucked into
television land by Beelzebub's
friend shunted from programme to
programme as he tries to survive 24
hours of shite telly' storylines.
Try and see this film, not for a
story or a splendid evening's
entertainment but to laugh as loud
as you can in the cinema at every
sketch you see. Keep an eye out for
'Yogi Beer' 'Silencer of the
Lambs', '30 Something to Life', '3
Men and Rosemary's Baby' and
especially 'Dwayne's Underworld!,
Dwayne's Underworld!' Party
time, excrement! Wiff. Wiff. 'Stay
Tuned'—it's C R A Z Y .
