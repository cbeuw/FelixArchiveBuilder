Ents undermined Walkway buy out
by D e c l a n Curry
The three-cornered tiff between
Rag, Imperial College Union (ICU)
Ents and Imperial College Radio
continues this week. The dispute
began last week when Ents refused
a disco booking from Rag, despite
the personal intervention of Chris
Davidson, ICU President, and
Mandy Hurford, Union General
Manager. The booking was for the
'Great Rag Bash', the penultimate
function of Rag Week. The disco
was eventually done last Friday by
IC Radio, using a mix of their own
equipment and some Ents
equipment. The remaining Ents
equipment, which is Union
property, had been hired out for a
private function by Dominic
Wilkinson, I C U Honorary
Secretary.
The start of the 'Great Rag Bash'
was marred by a disagreement
between Ents and IC Radio, with
Andrew Kerr, Ents Chairman,
among those refusing to allow IC
Radio access to Ents equipment.
Rick Bilby, ICU Deputy Chairman,
had earlier given IC Radio
permission to use some Ents
equipment so that the disco could
proceed. M r Kerr, who refused to
be party to this, locked the
equipment in a cupboard owned by
Ents, and withheld the key. The
door was subsequently opened by
Mr Bilby, who, as one of that
night's duty sabbaticals, also had a
key. After some further heated
discussion between M r Bilby, Mr
Kerr, Ents, Rag and IC Radio, the
disco was allowed to continue. The
hire fee for the disco had earlier
been waived by IC Radio.
During the later stages of the
evening, Mr Kerr and another
member of the Ents team were
overheard shouting personal abuse
at Rachel Mountford, Rag
Chairman. Eyewitnesses told Felix
that some of the comments were
intimidatory, and were intended to
cause upset and offence to Miss
Mountford. Miss Mountford and
Mr Kerr did not comment to Felix
on this incident.
Graduates jobs drop
by D e c l a n Curry
Further evidence of student
hardship was published this week
along with figures showing that
only 38% of last year's graduates
were fully employed by Christmas
1992.
A survey by Strathclyde
University welfare officers shows
that 15% of students occasionally
go without food, while 24% of
undergraduates say they cannot
afford textbooks. One in four
Strathclyde students have term time
work. The welfare report says that
'nearly everyone said that they
could not concentrate on studying
because they worried daily about
making ends meet'.
The Strathclyde report follows an
earlier survey conducted by the
Times Higher Education
Supplement. The THES poll,
conducted among 2,770 readers,
showed that 75% of those asked
thought student financial hardship
is damaging academic standards.
Only 8.7% of those asked argued
that student hardship did not
damage standards.
Allegations of financial hardship
have also attracted the attention of
over 70 MPs who have signed a
House of Commons motion which
says that 'underfunding' has
brought about a crisis in higher
education. The motion says that a
shortfall in funding has led to a 'lack
of student accommodation forcing
students to pay rents at exorbitant
levels'.
There has been a continuing
decline in the percentage of
graduates employed at the end of
their graduating year, falling from
51.5% in 1988 to last year's figure
of just 38%. This contrasts with an
increase in the percentage of
graduates emigrating, going into
temporary employment or further
education and training.
The 1992 end of year graduate
unemployment figure of 9.8% is up
from the 1988 figure of 6.2%.

At Imperial College Union (ICU)
Council on Monday, Chris
Davidson, the I C U President,
announced plans for the
development of the Sherfield
'Walkway' that leads to the Junior
Common Room (JCR).
The plans involve the
introduction of trading outlets along
the walkway. Space would be
created by reducing the size of the
JCR and converting alcoves lining
the walkway into shop units.
Ilffffffl,
In an interview with Felix, M r
Davidson said that the plans were
still subject to a feasibility study.
When questioned about the likely
timescale of the development, Mr
Davidson said, 'I'd like to see it
happen over the summer'.
Negotiations are currently
underway to determine whether the
outlets will be run by the College
or ICU. Discussions and market
research on the type of outlets are
also taking place.
Doors damaged
by A n d r e w T s e n g
On Saturday evening, one of the
doors on the 2nd Mezzanine floor
of the Union Building was kicked
down during a performance of a
play by the Chinese society, who
have admitted liability to the
incident. The door enclosed the
main light switch and junction
boxes that supply electricity to the
whole of the Union Building.
David Henderson-Begg, one of
the bar staff, and Steve Newhouse,
an ICU steward, were the first on
the scene. The Chinese Society
production was reportedly in an
intermission when a security guard
locked the door, and as a result the
Chinese Society could not lower the
house lights for the second half of
the performance.
After trying, unsuccessfully, for
20 minutes to get a key. One of the
Chinese Society members kicked
down the door. The shift engineer
is reported to have wanted the
performance stopped immediately
and the Chinese Society banned
from the Union Building. However,
in the event, the performance went
on without further incident.
Evelyn Gardens common room change
by J a c o b A n d e l i n
Shared common room facilities for
all halls in Evelyn Gardens are to
be introduced, with the creation of
a single 'Evelyn Gardens' Hall of
Residence. Current plans suggest
that all students will able to use the
four existing rooms in the Evelyn
Gardens area. These rooms would
become a television room, a quiet
room for studying, and a room for
dancing. No purpose has yet been
found for the fourth room.
The plan was announced at lastl
Monday's Imperial College Union
Council meeting by Nicky Fox,
Union Housing Officer. The new
communal common rooms will be
placed in the basement of existing
halls. Access will be from street
level using the security
'swipecards'. Residents of the hall
in which a particular social area is
placed will then be given exclusive
access to their hall from the
common area, again by use of the
'swipecards'.
