Sham-e-Ghazal, A Night Of Songs
Natasha Anwar reviews the latest happenings from the Pakistan Society
Saturday 20th February will be an
important day for all music loving
members of college. For it is on this
day that a variety programme has
been organised by the Pakistan
Society in conjunction with Pak
Socs from other London Colleges.
This is the first musical event to be
brought into existence by the
present day committee, and is the
largest collaboration of its kind
between London Pak Socs.
The evening is entitled Sham-e-
Ghazal, which simply translates to
a night of love songs. It is to be held
in the SCR (Sherfield), with doors
opening at 7pm. The show will start
with an exhibition of Pakistani
humour in the form of several small
comedy sketches performed by
students from L S E and Kings
College. This promises to be quite
an experience, with much audience
participation expected - you have
been warned!
However, the highlight of the
evening will be a performance by
Kausar Habib, a renowned ghazal

members will be re-elected?
(especially young Pakistanis) are
under the impression that ghazals
are songs one sings when
depressed, suicidal or suffering
from indigestion. This cannot be
further from the truth. If you take
some time to listen to a ghazal,
without any preconceived ideas that
may prejudice your judgement, I
am sure you will realise that ghazals
are beautiful pieces of Urdu
literature (phrases, sonnets etc.) that
are threaded together with
mesmerising music.
Even if you do not understand
Urdu, listening to the music alone
is an unforgettable experience.
Tickets can be bought from
committee members of the Pak Soc.
Priced at £4 (non-members £4.50),
there is a limited number of tickets
available, so buy now to avoid
disappointment. Which one of the
present committee members will be
re-elected?
After the 20th February, a date
outlined in my diary is the 26th
February - Election Day. Anyone
interested in hard-work, slanging
matches, thinking-of-interesting-
things-to-do, and all without much
hope of any praise or gratitude, then
please contact the President so that
nominations can be considered and
publicised. The official election
nomination papers will be put on the
notice board on Friday 19th
February (that's next week!). A
nominee requires a proposer and a
seconder, who can both preferably
say more than "Vote for him/her
because he/she is my best friend".
All the posts on the committee are
up for grabs, so get working on
those oratory skills.
The resident committee has decided
to collaborate the elections with an
Iftar Dinner (the month of
Ramadan is under two week
away!!). It is planned that the dinner
shall be held in the Union Dining
Hall, starting at 5.20pm (approx.),
with the elections taking place in the
Concert Hall immediately after
(approx. 7pm). Surely an
auspicious end to a year of
tyrannical reign by Khurrum Sair
(the resident President)!!!
Further details of the Iftar Dinner
and elections can be obtained by
reading the next issue of Paigham
(due Friday 19th February) or
consulting our notice board on the
Sherfield Walkway.
NB: To all members of the Pak Soc,
I urge you all to attend the elections
on 26th February, as any questions
you may have pertaining to the
happenings during the past year can
be answered. Per chance you may
have any suggestions for
improvements, these will be noted
by the new committee. Also any
objections towards nominations can
be reviewed, since there is no use
complaining about the Pak Soc if
you, the members, can't be
bothered to get involved yourselves.
