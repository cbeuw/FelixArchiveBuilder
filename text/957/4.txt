Jazz&Rock soc for the bands, and
B/sht lust
Dear Jonty,
I do, of course, realise that the
prospect of being handcuffed to me
is enough to drive even the most
well-balanced male insane with lust
for a period of time—however,
judging from last week's outburst
in 'Cat's Eyes', it would seem that
your well-loved and witty
correspondent P J Dodd was
Other centres
Dear Mr Beavan,
In September I bought a leisure
pass for Kensington and Chelsea
Sports Centres. To do this I simply
had to provide proof of residence
in the Royal Borough and proof of
being a student. This pass means
that I can enjoy free swimming at
any time and a substantial reduction
for the use of the weights gym.

most.
May I respectfuly suggest that, in
order to prevent this kind of thing
happening again, you get a cold
shower installed in the Felix Office
as quickly as possible?

Just thought that you might like to
know.

When will the trouble ever
stop?
Different meanings
Dear Jonty,
With reference to the letter by
Gavin J R Pearson printed in Felix,
Issue 955. The correct procedure
for any student having grievances
with a permanent member of staff,
particularly an ICU receptionist, is
to approach the President of the
Union or the Union manager, who
will deal promptly and discretly
with their complaint. In this
particular instance, if I were dealing
with the matter I would have
ushered M r Pearson into my office,
asked him to take a seat, listened to
his deprecation and then offered
him some advice or appropriate
channel of action, such 'Why don't
you fuck off and get a life you
anally retentive dip shit'.
This response if of course a
complete fallacy, but is though as
factually accurate as the content of
M r Pearson's letter, who
incidentally I'm told, had to be
directed on the correct spelling of
menstrual, which as a point of
information for M r Pearson has
something to do with women and
nothing to do with a chocolate
covered sweet (that melts in your
mouth and not in your hand).
Though I should imagine that M r
Pearson's experience with the latter
far outweighs his experience of the
former.
As a second and concluding point
of information the term 'menstrual
tension' is incorrect as it is now a
medically recognised syndrome, the
title of which is PMS, which
coincidentally also happens to be
the three title letters of Permanent
Member of Staff.
Spooky isn't it?
Dominic Wilkinson,
Honorary Secretary (Events) ICU
Dear Jonty,
I read Felix 956 with interest, I
refer particularly to Lorna
Mountford's letter. Lorna is
however mistaken, because the vast
majority of people I know agreed
with what I wrote. I can substantiate
this by saying that bar staff,
Dramsoc people and regular users
of the union thanked me for putting
my point across so succinctly.
Students at this college are sick
and tired of the sloppy standards of
service that they get in the Union
and I have stuck my neck out and
voiced this. Students booking a van
to go to Ireland or Germany don't
want to find out that they can or
can't have the van two days before
the trip. They want to know who
runs which clubs and when events
are. What is more, they don't want
to be insulted when asking
questions.
If the receptionist at my sponsors
(Jaguar Cars) was stroppy she'd be
sacked. The fact that is she doesn't
know the answer to a question she
politely asks the customer to wait
and then finds out the answer cooly
and efficiently. The same applies to
our receptionists. There are three
million unemployed at the moment
and I'm sure that we could find two
polite individuals to replace the rude
examples of the breed we currently
have.
Whilst Lorna may experience all
sweetness and light from Cathy and
Michelle the point is that most
people don't. If they feel so put
upon that they have to insult any
single customer then they're always
able to hand their notice in and get
their P45. Hopefully they'll wake
up to this fact and do something
about it.
Yours sincerely,
Gavin J R Pearson, Mech Eng 3.
