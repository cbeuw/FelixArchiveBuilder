Sports delays RCM visit
The Imperial College Sports
Centre will not open until 7 am on
Monday 21st February one week
after the advertised opening date.
Official opening is to be delayed
for seven days due to continuing
difficulties with contractors
employed to run the refurbishment
operation. The exact problems are
not known but the project is now 6
weeks beyond the planned opening
date of Monday 4th January.
Previous delays in the opening have
been attributed to: too many
committees and the hardness of the
ground in which the Sports Centre
is located.
Elections
by G Light & D Curry
The election for the 1993-4 Imperial
College Union (ICU) sabbatical
posts ignited this week. Election
papers were posted outside the
Union office last Monday at
9.30am. By Thursday evening, six
candidates had publicly declared
their ambitions, and two Ian Davies
and David Goddard, were already
proposed and fully seconded. At the
time of Felix going to press late on
Thursday, the declared candidates
were Ian Davies, Beccy Land,
David Goddard, Max Jalil, Charles
Leary and Rachel Mountford. New
Election will also stand for all posts.
Rachel Mountford, a third year
Civil Engineering student, is
standing for the post of ICU
President, currently held by Chris
Davidson. Miss Mountford is
currently Chairman of Rag. Ms
Mountford will almost certainly be
challenged by Andrew Wensley a
third year mathematician, M r
Wensley has yet to officially declare
Mr Rick Bilby, ICU Deputy
President, did not know how
students would be compensated for
the further loss of use of the Sports
Centre. The contract under which
the refurbishments took place
means that the contractors will
suffer a penalty for every day of
delay. It is expected that the delay
now incurred will create serious
debate about how much the
contractors should be paid.
Even though the work has yet to
be completed, an unofficial opening
will be held at midday today for
senior members of Imperial College
to preview the changes.
his candidature.
Miss Mountford, who has ten
seconders, has not, as yet, been
proposed for the post of President.
Marc Swan, President of St. Mary's

in last weeks Felix that he would act
as Miss Mountford's proposer. Ms
Mountford was proposed late on
Thursday by Nicky Fox, ICU
Housing Officer.
David Goddard has put his name
forward for Deputy President, a
post currently held by Rick Bilby.
Mr Goddard, in Physics 3, has been
proposed by Sarah McCartney, a
third year Maths student. M r
Goddard was last year's editor of
Broadsheet, the RCSU newssheet.
Mr Goddard is one of sixteen

has been proposed by Graham Hay,
currently Chairman of the Social,
Cultural and Amusements Board, a
Union Major Sub- Committee.
Another of M r Leary's seconders
is Rachel Mountford, presidential
candidate. By 4.30 pm on Thursday

proposer.

Mark Jackson, otherwise known as
'Trig'. Beccy Land will also be
standing for the position and has
been proposed by Stuart Rison.
