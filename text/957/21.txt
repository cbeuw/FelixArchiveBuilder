This is the first production of
Robert Griffith's play, which
follows the lives of a group of
Russian Serfs in the 1820s. Anatole,
an actor, is brought to the estate in
order to train a group of serfs to
perform before their Count and
Countess.
The small cast performed well,
not only in their main roles, but also
in the parts they played during the
reminiscences of Anatole, and
others. Movement played an
important part in the play, and
worked well to convey the varying
moods, especially Yermilovna's
Foot A b o v e the H e a d
Foot Above the Head is an adaption
and re-working of Shakespeare's
unfinished play 'Timon of Athens'.
A cast of eight women including a
violinist, explore the story of false,
profitable friendships.
Timon of Athens is an unusual
play and certainly incomparable
with the great Shakespeare tragedies
that preceded it. Blood Stone has
managed to adapt the original text,
full of roughness and
inconsistencies, into a performance
that is finished in its conception.
Timon, a mistress of Athens, is
surrounded with many, false and
flattering friends. She is naive and
unaware of her financial state. Her
bounty shows itself in hedonism and
high living, more than old-
fashioned benevolence. Sudden
discovery of naivety, and finally,
unexpected discovery of an
inexhaustible supply of gold make
the whole story seem like a fairy-
tale. However this does not detract
from greatness of this work. The
exact cause of Timon's death is left
poetically obscure.
Sioban Stamp, as Timon, gave a
good performance, however, acting
wasn't the strong point of this play;
the stage, with real desert sand,
was. Every detail was chosen with
care and objects falling from ceiling
make a great metaphor showing
Timon's beliefs in people and
wealth disappearing. It is worth
mentioning the stage manager, well
done, Anna Howarth!
If you are in a fringe theatre
mood, Foot Above the Head, a
benefit for Friends of the Earth, is
worth a visit.

dance for her dead husband.
The use of a narrator who was
involved in the story added a great
deal. For some of the relatively
young cast it was obviously difficult
to relax, leading to a slightly stilted
nature of some of the scenes, but the
majority of the acting was very
good.
The theatre can be found in a
large garage at the back of a
countyard (hence the theatre's
name), and seats about thirty. Its
small nature draws you into the
play. I highly recommend this
play—it's fairly cheap for one thing,
but a word of warning—wear warm
clothes as the theatre is very cold.

S m a l l Talk A b o u t
C h r o m o s o m e s
You can be quite sure it's going to
be something different when the
cast troop in, sit down at the table
laid out as if for a press conference,
and immediately shoot off into mad
debate, all conducted via
microphones.
Actually this is just the beginning
of a strange, dazzling and often
downright bizarre piece concerning
itself with what happens when Bill
and Shona (James Eastaway and
Sue Mound) find their relationship
rapidly disintegrating. The title
refer to the work of a doctor,
exceptionally acted by William
Brooke (he is one of the two real
doctors supposedly in the play?),
whose job it is to counsel them on
the consequences of embryo testing.
The refreshing style mooted here
translates particularly well in the
Bush, a small theatre above a pub,
where the closeness of the cast
definitely adds something.
Additionally the clever use of music
breaks, the dance routines and a
well constructed set which makes
good use of limited space. My only
reservation was with the film at the
end: entitled 'Pier Pressure' and
projected from the stage for the
characters to watch, it involved a
day at the seaside with two
unintroduced children, Bill and the
doctor. Just where this left us, after
the play had seemingly been wound
up, I'm uncertain. Nevertheless
after only two years together
'Theatre PUR can feel rightly proud
of this entertaining and highly
original piece of theatre.

Paramour, Twilight, Pavane,
D o n Quixote, F a c a d e ,
The G r e e n T a b l e
Six ballets in one evening may
sound like an effort, but don't be
fooled. The programme permits a
diversity of forms and styles to be
presented, each complimenting the
other. 'Paramour' is a light-hearted
look at flirtations between two
couples,.with an amusing twist in
the tail. This was followed by a
complete change of mood with
'Twilight'. A ballet for two dancers
exploring sexual politics within a
couple's relationship. A very
modern ballet, it received a muted
response, despite being extremely
well performed. I was pleased to
see the Birmingham Royal Ballet,
still prepared to present such
difficult and little-seen works.
Kenneth MacMillan's Pas de deux
to Faure's 'Pavane' followed, and
immediately the mood changed
again. Beautiful and moving, an apt
tribute to the great choreographer
who died late last year. 'Don
Quixote'—Pas de deux, notably the
only non-20th century ballet of the
evening, was next on show and can
obly be described as stunning.
Lively, vibrant and exciting, the
crowd actually cheered and whisded
at the dancers. I have never seen a
reception like this, to a ballet,
before.
Next stop, 'Facade', a witty,
popular ballet consisting of seven
short dances. This proved to be an
amusing interlude before the final
and longest of the evening's
offerings—'The Green Table'.
Altogether, a powerful and
imposing ballet, it portrays
excellendy the horror and futility of
war. The whole show was superbly
presented and left us all slightly
overawed.
An all-round-enjoyable evening,
and I would recommend
Birmingham Royal Ballet's 'mixed
bag' evenings to anybody—
particularly if you've never been
before. They make an excellent
introduction to the diversity of the
medium.

Boot boy rises to run cobbler's shop
via spinster sister and Drunken
Master... Hmm!
Eschewing the staple balletic fare
of swans, fairies and an influx of
national dancers. Composer, Paul
Reade, and choreographer, David
Bintley, have produced a stunning
full length ballet from Harold
Brighouse's northern rags to riches
fable.
Reade's pretty melodies and witty
rhythms explore every plot detail
(try to overlook some grotesque
'Hollywoodesque' orchestrations by
Lawrence Ashton) and Bintley
embellishes each note with
enchantingly natural and
refreshingly original steps. The
result is an involving, fluid and
detailed dramatic line unusual in the
classical ballet medium.
Birmingham Royal Ballet's
production polishes every facet of
this modern classic to a sparkle:
Vincent Redman's shyly chirpy
boot boy wins every heart including
Marion Tate's. Her tight-lipped
Maggie has the guts and grace of
a shrewd woman not to be messed
with. Her sisters, and attendant
beaux are touchingly young, happy
and in love. Every nuance and
outburst in Bintley's steps is
delivered with ease and oomph. DO
NOT MISS THIS B A L L E T .
