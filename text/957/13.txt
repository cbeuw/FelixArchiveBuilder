This years R A G Parachute for
Multiple Sclerosis Society has been
booked for the weekend of 13th
March. It will take place at the
London SkySports centre on the
M40 (about an hour out of London
on the M40). Training for the jump
will take place the week before in
college and will take the form of a
briefing on one evening, followed
by training in a gym the next.
To jump, a deposit of eighty
pounds is required - payable to
Multiple Sclerosis Society, but this
can be reclaimed if over one
hundred and thirty pounds is raised
in sponsorship. This cheque MUST
reach me by the 28th February at
the L A T E S T . Pick up an
application form and a sponsor form
at the R A G meeting today, 1.10
Ents Lounge or contact me,
Michael Chamberlain ( R A G
Sponsored Events Officer) via the
RAG office.
