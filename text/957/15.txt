Up the Pedestal
The Mountaineering Club's first
trip of 1993 was to the Roaches, in
Staffordshire. We travelled up on
the Friday evening, eventually
finding a campsite and more
importantly a pub.
We awoke on Saturday morning
to find ourselves in the middle of
thick mist, with no sign of the mild,
sunny day the weather forecasters
had promised. However after a
quick trip into Buxton to stock up
with food, we ventured to the crag.
The weather gave no signs of
improving, but undeterred we
ventured onto a few of the easier
climbs. During the day there were
few flashes of brilliance from the
club's star climbers, but beginners
had plenty of experience of easier
climbs. The day ended with Andy
getting stuck half way up a climb
called 'Pedalstal Crack' in failing
light, but a rope was lowered to him
and he eventually climbed up, it
now being completely dark. We
spent the evening back in the pub,
finally out-drinking Coventry
Polytechnic's Mountaineering Club
(we know they're no longer a poly,
but it seems they don't).
During the night there was a large
amount of rain, which was good
news for those who wanted a lie in.
By 9.00am the rain had stopped, but
it had been replaced by an icy wind.
We returned to the crag hoping that
the wind had dried the rock. For
once it had, and the base of the crag
was even slightly sheltered from the
wind. This was not the case at the
top and the lead climber was often
almost frozen solid by the time their
second had followed them up.
During the afternoon we even saw
the sun (a rare event) and harder
Sneakers
This week, FilmSoc is pleased to be
showing Sneakers, a high-tech
movie with stacks of stars in it, lots
) of laughs, and a plot that Time Out
described as 'twistier than a
^ Mandelbrot Curve'. Still playing on
Leicester Square, the film features
Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix,
Mary McDonnell and Sidney
Poitier supporting Robert Redford
and Ben Kingsley as good guy and
bad guy who were once partners in
computer crime together. Redford
plays Martin Bishop, who heads a
team of computer gurus who
specialise in hacking to test
corporate security systems.
Bishop's dark past catches up with
him, when the CIA use it to force
him and his team to do a job for
them, and retrieve a little black box
of particular interest to them. Using
their limitless supply of Bond-style
gadgets in all manner of dangerous
surroundings, the team battle to get
the box, leading to a showdown
between Redford and Kingsley,
who plays a surprisingly mean bad
guy with a really mean pony tail.
The cleverest comedy thriller in a
long time, from the amusing
anagrams of the actor's names in
the opening titles, to the hilarious
final scene, this film is guaranteed
to make you chuckle and will please
everybody. This is one not to be
missed!
Entrance is only 90p for
members, otherwise £1.90, and
membership is a real bargain at
£3.50 including Sneakers free,
especially when you consider that
in the next few weeks we've got
Peter's Friends, Death Becomes
Her, and White Men Can't Jump all
queueing up for the chance to be
matched in Mech Eng 220. See you
at 7.30 next Thursday.
routes were thought about, and in
most cases climbed. Finally we
returned to the minibus, just
missing a large raincloud moving
towards the crag.
The Mountaineering Club has
trips every other weekend and no
(previous experience is necessary.
For further details see the
noticeboard opposite the climbing
wall, situated by the entrance to the
Livenet TV studio off the Sherfield
Walkway.
'Every night the set that's smart is
indulging in nudist
parties...ANYTHING GOES.'
ICSF-Aliens
ICSF is proud to present its eight
day Alien binge. Kicking off on
Monday, it starts with a rare H R
Giger (Alien's designer) video
about the production of Alien. We
will then show Alien itself in full
widescreen, which will be followed
by The Making of Alien 3 and also
a documentary about Alien director
Ridley Scott. Alien is a science
fiction/horror classic featuring
terrific photography and designs
that are still stunningly original.
The film is not for the squeamish,
so bring along someone you want
to throw up over.
On Tuesday, we are pleased to be
showing James Cameron's (The
Terminators, The Abyss) riveting
sequel to Alien. Despite being one
of the most exciting action films
ever made, this film still boasts a
superb central performance by
Sigourney Weaver, in the midst of
guns and aliens aplenty.
Monday's events are in Chem
Eng LT1 and start with the Giger
video at 6pm and Alien at 6.30pm.
Entry is 70p to Members for any or
all of the screening. Aliens on
Tuesday costs £1 for members to
get in to and starts at 7pm in Mech
Eng 220. Membership is just £3 and
includes your first film entry.
Remember, just when you thought
it was safe to stop screaming, we
still have Alien ' to come!
