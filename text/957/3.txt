Editorial
RAG attack
PJ Dodd isn't entirely
uncontroversial, whether you like
Cat's Eyes or not, many people
around Imperial read it if only, it
seems, to provide more ammunition
to criticise.
Even given this interest, I was
still horrified to discover that M r
Dodd had been assaulted last Friday
by what is known as a 'Frontal
Lobotomy-o-gram'. This delightful
display of brute force was organised
by the RCS Union, that renowned
bastion of sensitivity, but not
advertised as part of the usual japes
for Rag Week. Before any one
complains of a serious sense of
humour failure, M r Dodd was not
alone in his objection, several other
members of Felix staff were
extremely intimidated by the actions
of this masked group of thugs and
the only other 'Frontal Lobotomy-
o-gram' performed last week also
received a compliant.
Sensibly, Rachel Mountford and
Paul Thomas have distanced
themselves from the actions of these
hooligans, being acutely aware that
if Rag is not enjoyed by all the
students participating it quickly
loses any support or interest. But
this does not stop the accusation of
'well, he was asking for it'. I
particularity resent this attitude, if
someone publishes something,
criticism is expected, mugging is
not. Surely, more intelligent ways
of registering your disapproval can
be found. Still more surprising is
that M r Andrew Wensley a usually
sensitive individual should make
himself party to these actions, I am
most disappointed.

STOIC have once again scaled
new heights of publicity seeking. In
this weeks 'Antithesis' column of
the Times Higher Educational
Felix 957
Supplement STOIC's pornographic
shenanigans were reported in
graphic detail. Even Publications
Board chairman Hugh Eland was
quoted extensively and accurately,
pouring scorn on the whole
shemozzle. There is still a chance
that STOIC will receive world
recognition for the extensive work
it does.

never knew was part of Imperial
College before and make your
friends your worst enemies. I, along

justice.

Valentine's Day
I love Valentine's Day, because it
is a rare opportunity to start
malicious rumours and spiteful
gossip. Turn to page seven and have
a good laugh at some of the
messages as I did. (To quash any
rumours before they get out of
hand, I did N O T write any of the
Valentines).

At last there will be a worthwhile
programme for IC radio, one which
is strictly based on IC news and
events only. Due to start at 6.30 pm
on Tuesday 23rd, the yet to be
named half-hourly show aims to
contain all the events for the
forthcoming week as well as the
previous weeks news and
information. Clubs and Societies
take note: the publicity is totally
FREE! Only an idiot would pass on
this opportunity.
Security Alerts
I am not the only one who is fed-
up, no sorry., correction, pissed off
with the state of the London
Underground at the moment. Since
last week, South Kensington tube
has been closed three times at least;
last Wednesday (3rd), Monday
night (8th) and Wednesday morning
(10th). And there was also the mass
closure of several stations on
Wednesday 3rd; 15 at least I
counted. Like many commuters, I
dream of the day when there are no
security alerts, no cancelled trains,
clean platforms (not the shoes),
clean trains, cheap fares (this really
IS a dream) and station announcers
who have excellent pronunciation.

For poor perverts everywhere there
is now the opportunity to watch 48
hours (or there abouts) of non-stop
sex. This weekend, BBC2 and
Channel 4 are competing for
viewing figures in the T V sex war.
Both sides promise tantalising treats
all Saturday night and for part of
Sunday night and have recruited
sexy, young presenters to host the
soft porn shows, such as Nina
Myskow. Hmmm, can't wait!
D r a c u l a
Seen Bram Stoker's / Francis Ford
Coppella's Dracula yet? Don't.
Read the book instead and save
yourself the anguish of watching
Keanu Reeves attempt an English
accent.

Rag week; loveless, lifeless,
tasteless, helpless and hopeless.
Why bother? That joke isn't funny
any more!
Rag Twats—who are they? First
year norms with a violent desire to
be mad, silly and part of it (part of
anything that will accept them more
like). Yes, no one else would have
them. So a jolly good time is had
by all at the jolly old rag office,
RAH! R A H ! FUCKIN' R A H !
I knpw! What a marvellous fund
raising type activity it would be if
we got a humourless ex-public
school boy to dress up as a gnome
(yes kids a gnome) and disturb
biology lectures for a hundred or so
students trying to pass a few silly
exams.
Or even better—go into Felix and
physically assault Phil (Cat's Eyes)
Dodd for a few pennies to help the
orphans! (It's O K kids, always
remember that the ends justify the
means when you're a sad bastard).
It's a well known fact that there
are no bad soldiers, just bad
officers. Rachel 'Rag Chair'
Mountford went wrong when she
didn't get a grip of her people at the
outset. Being in charge means that
you are responsible, and the bullied
public school boys unleashed back
on society with a cause and an
excuse for vindictive and violent
behaviour should have been vetted
out of the programme to start with.
They should have a little test—
here's one we prepared earlier:
1. Are you a first year
Mechanical Engineer with no
friends?
2. Did you get constantly bog-
washed and fed laxative chocolate
at your minor public school?
3. Do you own a Freddy
Mercury tribute concert t-shirt?
4. Are you a middle-classed
state school kid that felt cheated
by having missed out on all the
boyish public school japes like
beating the only black kid in the
school until he bleeds profuseley
from the mouth and rectum.
Not all the Raggies are Rag Twats,
but there are enough to make it a
big waste of time and energy for all
of those involved for the right
reasons.
As we all know, Rag raises an
awful lot of money for charity—fair
enough. It's just the twat brigade
that gets me down. The ends never
justify the means.
Perhaps next year we can hope
something truly constructive and
meaningful like a sponsored
'Morrissey Quote-athon'. I'll start.
'Two lovers entwined pass me
by, and heaven knows I'm
miserable now!'
Oh! I'm fed up with this already.
Got any Primal Scream!
