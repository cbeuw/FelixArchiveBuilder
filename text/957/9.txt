Rhian Pic ton reports to mere mortals about ICU Council.
Felix 957
'eature
12 February 1993
My name is Rhian Picton. I am the
Biochemistry Department
Representative. Part of my job is to
sit on Imperial College Union
Council, to represent my
department's views and to
contribute to any discussions that
involve students. There was
recently an academic affairs half-
day, which all the departmental and
academic representatives were
invited to. This was an opportunity
to question the Rector (Sir Eric
Ash), Vernon McClure and Gareth
Jones (the College Senior Tutor)
about academic problems in the
departments.
However, it was blatantly
obvious that a lot of the academic
representatives didn't know a lot
about what happens in college and
the union, and more specifically are
vague about what happens at
Council. If they don't know such
things, how is anyone else supposed
to know? Someone there asked why
nothing was printed in Felix, and I
said that I would bring it up at
Council.
Which is why, the day after
Council, I am writing this. When
I mentioned that I thought every
student should know what happens
at Council, there was unanimous
agreement from the council
members. We all give up time to
discuss the issues that a lot of people
might dismiss as boring, and we
would like to know if other students
are happy with what decisions we
make. Do people think anything?
The government may try to disband
student unions before too long, and
I think that we would lose any
identity as a student body that we
still have now, if we lost the student
union, and that worries me. Some
people don't even know what the
union does. Does anyone care?
What follows this is a quick
description of who and what ICU
Council is and an account of the
January Council.
In next week's Felix, there will
be an account of what happened at
yesterday's (8th February) Council,
because I have run out of room.
At the end of the January report,
I will include the most urgent
problem from the February
Council, as people's opinions are
welcome.
ICU Council. Who is it?
ICU Council consists of the people
who do a job within ICU. They
include Steve Farrant (Chair of
ICU; the ICU exec, Chris, Rick and
Dom; C C U Presidents; Academic
Representatives for ICU, CCU's,
departments; Officers, such as
women's and welfare; Chair
people, such as Rag, Overseas
Committee (OSC), Athletic Clubs
Committee (ACC); Old Students
Representatives; two first years,
who were elected at the first ICU
U G M ; and four permanent
observers, Cathy and Mandy from
the Union Office, Howard
(Publicity Officer) and Jonty (Felix
Editor).
What is it?
ICU Council is an open arena—
anyone can come along and
speaking rights are usually given.
The officers can submit written
reports and request the support and
opinions of Council regarding
things that they would like to do.
Council members can question
decisions made by people on
Council, and if a debate arises a
vote is taken to decide what Council
thinks should be done.
So, what happened at the last
Council?
The minutes of Decemeber
Council were passed. There were
no matters arising from them.
Reports to Council were then
discussed.
Important points from the
reports.
Chris's Report
1. When the government were
discussing making students'
membership to Unions voluntary,
ICU set up a working party to
decide how we could attract
members if it happened. We
decided to promote ICU to both the
government and students as an
organisation that is vital for helping
students, as there was unclearness
on the role of the Union. A new
meeting has been called.
2. the Walkway outside the JCR
may be developed into retail units.
This is a great idea which is still
1
being discussed.
3. One of the ideas of the
voluntary membership working
party was to hold a 'Reaching Out
Stall' that had information on all the
clubs and societies of ICU. This
was held successfully on January
19th.
4. An 'employment agency' may
be set up to act as a go-between for
students and college/local job
vacancies.
Any other business is the final part
of Council.
There was a discussion about the
article in Felix that reported Chris
Davidson as being drunk at U L U
GUC (General Union Council).
Several people at Council were at
the meeting, and they told Council
that the report was untrue in parts.
It was felt that an accurate account
of the events should be sent to Felix
as the reputation of ICU's President
could be damaged if he ignored the
report (as he wanted to).
The final thing to mention then is
a subject that was brought up for
discussion at yesterday's council
(8th February).
Tim Cotton, the transport officer
is in charge of ICU's minibus fleet.
The insurance policy will need
renewing in just under 14 days. At
the moment if a driver crashes a
w\
minibus he/she must pay the first
£100.00 for the claim. This,
Council felt, was a totally
unreasonable amount of money to
expect students to pay. Council
suggested several things to Tim.
1. Try to find a better insurance
company.
2. If there is no cheaper insurance
company then ICU must find a way
to help the students eg create a
SLUSH fund (which would cover
some of the initial payment).
3. This would probably result in
the price of hiring an ICU minibus
increasing, but it will still be
necessary to maintain the fleet,
since drivers of private-hire
minibuses must be 23 years old.
Obviously, not many clubs and
societies have members that old
who could drive for them. This is
why Council want ICU to maintain
the minibus fleet.
Anyone with any questions,
ideas, thoughts, agreements or
arguments with my personal ideas,
or with any decisions we make on
Council can get in touch with us via
Felix, the Union, their Dep Reps,
Clubs and Societies chairpeople etc.
But please, we are trying to help the
students, not harm them, and we
welcome any comments if we can
use them to improve what we do.
