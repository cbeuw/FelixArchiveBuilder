so, the square Miss D goes to a
rave. Looking somewhere between
Laura Ashley and Oxfam
bargains—I donned a pair of jeans
and a black roll-neck hoping not to
advertise my total unhipness.
My brief: Well, what does a rave
look like?
Driving down Kingsland Road,
East London, you'd never know—if
you didn't know—that behind a
delapidated frontage a rave was
happnin' (man). The clues are
cars—VWs and 205s and the groups
of trendy young things strutting
down the road. When I arrived
there was a slight hitch to the event
as there were police in their
hundreds trying to close it down.
But, alas, legal loopholes saved the
day—more about that later. So, I
took a deep breath and strode out.
There were fearsome security
guards around who advised me to
'grab a cup of tea and get in the
queue'. So I did. Tickets, which had
to have been bought in advance
(legal loophole No. 1), were £15
and to prevent forgery had a U V
marking on them. Wow, thinks I,
this is business. Now, before I go
on I must reiterate again that this is
not my world, nine out of ten
Saturdays you'll find me watching
Casualty and eating frozen lasagne.
So how was I to know that my,
imaginings of lycra shorts and gart),
were so out of date; 'God that was
ages ago, yeah, that was last-
summer'.
So, having declared my body a
drug and alcohol free zone and
came to watch others who hadn't, i
I was as straight (in every sense of
the word) as you get.
Anti-raver, yesterday. '
We were in a warehouse of some ''
description. There were three |
different rooms and a simple chart
on the wall telling people which
room has which DJ at what time.
The walls had pictures and freezes
and projected images on them. One
ceiling had a parachute draped from
it. Other than this and some
impressive lights and lasers the
rooms were bare but for a pulse and
pulsating bodies, all dancing their
own way. I soon saw that no one J
cared what anyone else was i
wearing, no one was there to pull, I
everyone's dance was as good as
anothers. Of course, there were
drugs, but not so much as I
expected. There was some dope and
some speed, as far as acid and .
ecstasy, no doubt it was there but
not half so prevalent as Inspector
Morse would have us believe.
Drugs were not the scene, the scene
was music that doesn't let you stop.
That's how people finish
Marathons. The dancing itself is a
high. It's switch off the world—it's
the bodies, the music, the lights and
in a sense, it's a way of being 'at
one with yourself. The rooms were
full but somehow there was enough
space for everyone.
Thousands of people all dancing.
So I watched. Such a buzz.
To buy a drink you need first to
have bought some straws, of the
drinking kind from the straw lady
(?) who sold them at £1 each. It's
really quite weird, but there you
have legal loophole No. 2. The
walls were dripping, the heat was
comforting, conversation was not
easy (or necessary).
What impressed me was the
professionalism. The people behind
this know what people want. They
want to dance, they want to buy
oranges, some want to have'tfiere
face painted. The people who run
' these things may not be pillars of
moral society but how many night
i> clubs service the loos and put clean
,bog roll in them at 4am. I mean,
they've already got our money! And
i the drinks are about half the price
^ of the average nightclub.
Drugs are a big part of the scene,
; I saw evidence of the, but it's not i
full of it—and if you're there until
the end then I'm sure some
stimulants might help you reach
10am on your feet. I just think
; people want to dance, they want to
" party in a primal way and leave the
' modern world behind them for a
night. But a legal version of this
atmosphere wouldn't work. There's
thought, planning, groovineSs and
planning behind the whole
operation. Nothing sinister—tell
your folks—some people know how
to party.
The Rave Game
Bored with Monopoly? Well, play
Cleudo then (Hello Raggies). But
once that's over, what next. Want
a board game that your
grandmother probably won't
approve of? One that Richard
Branson definitely doesn't approve
of? The Rave Game is here.
Originally released in 1991,"the
original version attracted top
reviews and sold by the thousand.
Until the News Of The World got
hold of a copy, leading to the game
being banned from sale in Virgin
and all the major games stores and
,4 catalogues. The ganie's creator, BP
Wow was physically ejected from
the Earl's Court Toy Fair last year.
! T V advertising stopped by the IBA,
t
> on grounds that the game may
' offend public decency. The game is
how" "remixed' in an updated
version. What on earth is in this
game?
Apart from a Jamie Hewlett
(Tank Girl) poster, there's three
phases to the game, involving
collecting flyers for the big rave
from clubs around a city, followed
by travelling around the country,
collecting E-nergi tokens to put in
the players' stash bags, avoiding
being busted, and finally the rave
scene, exchanging your E-nergi
i tokens for dance cards, to make up
• to a three piece psychedelic jigsaw,
all taking place on a dayglo and
silver playing mat.
The game is available for £24.99
from RAVCO, PO Box 10, London
I N l 3RJ. Playing the game is not
thought to be illegal by Felix's legal
office.
