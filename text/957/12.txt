So you survived Monopoly, so you
survived the great sightseeing
challenge? Well this time: Play with
Death. Chris Davidson is eating
daffodils by the root. Who dunnit,
where, with what and ... WHY?
The as yet unexplained death of the
uncontested leader of IC Union has
prompted R A G to offers thousands
of prizes to the teams that will help
them in the quest for the murderer.
So shake that ass and play
C L U E D O tomorrow (or pretend to
be a duck-billed platypus for the
day). If you haven't been hung-over
for the whole week, you should
have noticed the odd dead-body
outline around Imperial College. If
your IQ is positive (in IC?) you may
have associated them with
C L U E D O this term's Sexiest,
Hottest, Grooviest, Most gory RAG
event yet. So what's all this hype?
Come to think of it, what's
C L U E D O anyway? Remember
MONOPOLY? Well C L U E D O
uses the same concept, take a small
fry board game and make it BIG,
very BIG, London BIG. CLUEDO
is based on the well known board
game... C L U E D O (A concept that
EVEN a physicist can come to grips
with). Those of you who have never
played CLUEDO haven't lived. But
you can come and redeem yourself
this Saturday. The main aim of our
CLUEDO, is for you to have fun,
however, as a sideline, a bit of dosh
for R A G would be welcome. The
money you collect goes to BIBIC.
BIBIC is the British Institute for
Brain Injured Children.
Tiddlywinks was big, but it hurt
your fingers, Monopoly was
bigger, but not gory enough, The
Great Sightseeing Challenge was
large, but where were the mascots?
Answer: They were wanning up for
the biggest event of the all...
C L U E D O . Be there, meet Death,
meet Theta, see Spanner and Bolt,
meet the C L U E D O characters in
Dr Black loses his head over a game of billiards.
flesh and avenge the death of your
hero and mine... Mr. Stud 93,
Chris 'Scottish but Horny'
Davidson. Convinced yet? OK,
here's what you do: Turn up in Beit
Quad as soon as possible after 10
A M on Saturday with a team of four
to six people. At this point, you'll
be given a collecting tin and a clue
sheet. The object of the game is to
visit the nine locations around
London that are relevant to the
rooms on the CLUEDO board. The
catch here is the fact that you have
to work out, from the clues, where
these locations actually are. For
example the Hall might be the
Royal Albert Hall (its not). The
rooms are: Billiards Room, Dining
Room, Conservatory, Ballroom,
Kitchen, Library, Lounge, Study
Hall
The characters are:
Miss Peacock Blue
Miss Scarlet Red
Mrs White Guess
Agent Orange...You will know him
when you see him
Prof. Plum Purple
Grim Reaper Black
Rev. Green Green
Dr. Black Black
The weapons are:
Revolver
Dagger
Rope
Lead Pipe Theta
Spanner....Spanner & Bolt
Candlestick Davey
Anyway, at each of the locations
there will be either one of the
characters or one of the weapons.
When you think that you have
spotted one of them ask them: 'Do
you wear roll-on deodorant?'. If
you have the right person then you
will get a signature on your clue
sheet and a clue as to W H Y the
murder happened. If you don't have
the right person...
Oh by the way, if you are having
trouble working out the clues, the
marshalls are eminently bribeable
(currency unit: 1 pint). If you find
Dr. Black (the dead guy) cavorting
with the Grim Reaper then you have
found the scene of the crime. To
find who dunnit and using which
weapon you have to visit every
location on the board and deduce
whom and what is missing. I should
mention at this point that none of
the C C U mascots were involved.
They will be making an appearance
at some random time and if you
happen to be there at the same time
as one of them, you get bonus
points. Did I mention treasure?
When you think you know why
Chris was assassinated (him being
Scottish is not sufficient) then your
team can act out a short sketch
illustrating your brainwave. If you
have collected any relevant
'treasure' (no not traffic cones or
shopping trolleys) along the way
you will get extra points for using
them as props. On the subject of
points, here is how they work: 1 pt-
for each pound collected (divided
by team size) 10 pts- for each
location signature (50 if mascot was
there) 25 pts- for right place 50 pts-
for right assassin points are doubled
for a full set of signatures max. 50
pts for sketch.
There will be separate prizes for
winning team and highest collector.
Last year Cambrige R A G took part
and whipped our ass. This year we
also have to contend with Charing
Cross and Essex, so this time pull
your finger out and fight for the
recovery of our honour. Finally;
don't forget to collect lots of money
along the way.
