On a bike and a prayer
Chris Riley finds the road to the Atlantic becomes more difficult in the
penultimate episode of the Morroccan saga
It was over ten days later that we
freewheeled towards Jbel Toubkal.
The road climbed, twisted and
weaved through the Pre-Cambrian
lava flows, passing cliffside green
villages cascading from Iberian-buff
crags on a deep blue sky. Sour was
twenty-six kilometres away and
long in coming, particularly for
Andrea who had been feeling sick
all day. It had one shop where we
bought vintage cokes and squeezed
ourselves into a chink of shade to
swig them. The village came out to
watch, but quickly went inside
when my camera emerged.
My rear tyre was refusing to stay
inflated and I repaired it three times
before we reached Amsouzart for
our last stop before Toubkal. The
village nestled by a broad clear ford
and sprouted up the valley sides in
geometric blocks of balconies and
wall-less rooms with post card
views. A l l around were timeless
hills of wind washed cashew nut
trees and green meadows of grazing
lazy livestock. The main street was
shady and rubble strewn. Poultry
clucked around the edges. The hotel
owner was Omar - a man with a
strong business acumen - a hotel to
please, and a relaxed 'anything is
possible' attitude. The centre piece
of the building was the middle floor
of a vast airy room with cushions
round the edge and a view up the
valley towards Imhilene.
When you enquired the price - he
just blinked slowly and said 'si vous
voulez.' He bought us sweet milky
coffees in long glasses, and we sat
and sipped them whilst staring up
the valley at the poplars and peach
trees swaying below the rose-red
lofty peaks and the blackberry blue
sky.
In the day light which remained
I readied my bike for the planned
ascent of Toubkal tomorrow. It was
decided that I was the only one to
take the bike up the mountain. The
other two would act as sherpas to
carry the food, water and sleeping
bags for the two nights and three
days on the peak. We would collect
a guide from the villages on the
struggled past a new house they
were building on the edge of town.
His little weasely face looked us up
and down and his one tainted tooth
quivered with glee. He grabbed a
load off us and beetled up the shady
road to his cafe to negotiate a price.
The 200 pounds he originally asked
for to act as guide dropped swiftly
to 20 and after a nod of agreement
from us, he disappeared inside the
mud stained building to emerge two
minutes later in a pair of broken
slip-on-shoes, a pair of half-mast
brown corduroy trousers and a short
sleeve shirt. His luggage was a
white plastic bag of two pieces of
bread and a tin of sardines. Armed
thus, he put on both Andrea's and
Stephane's rucsacs, causing his
neck to be bent double and his chin
to rest on his chest - and he was off
up the rubbley path to Lake Ifni.
By the time I caught everyone up
carrying my bike over the rubbley
hair-pin bent track, the guide was
having reservations about his
impossible load. I left the other two
to sort out a new deal involving a
mule and plodded on up the cliff-
like scree slope, bike over shoulder.
It was beyond my comprehension
that a man dressed so inadequately
could guide us without food up such
inhospitable terrain. We pressed on
in the afternoon across a gigantic
beach of shingle over a mile long,
from the lake to the Toubkal Gorge.
As I bumped my bike over the rocks
we passed a group of French
trekkers heading down from
Toubkal. They nodded but hardly
acknowledged us as if we were
pedestrians on the Champs Elysees
- instead of adventurers at the base
of North Africa's highest mountain.
From the edge of the shingle the
track climbed like some never
ending loft ladder up to the peaks
of the rich brown cones. The peaks
were a world away and scratching
at the passing cumulo-nimbus and
cirrus clouds which flew in
formation vapour trailing over the
rocks. The perspective was
destroyed by the immensity of such
structures and it was inconceivable
to imagine we could ever reach it
by climbing alone - let alone
carryine a bicycle!
