S c o r p i o Rising — U L U
Scorpio Rising are not on top form.
Mr Scorpio looks a bit bored, to tell
the truth. He's not prancing around
like he usually does. Maybe he's
shy with his new female bassist.
The lights are still flashing away as
ever, but his hearts not in it. It's
kind of infectious like measles or
mumps or a really bad case of some
other highly dodgy and contagious
childhood disease. I think I've
caught it and I actually like this
band, even if they do make you
come out in a rash. 'Bliss' is still
A l i c e in C h a i n s — C a m d e n
U n d e r w o r l d
I recalled this band from two years
ago as an intense experience, and
tonight was an intense gig, with no
unnecessary stuffing, refreshing in
a hand so relentlessly hyped
recently.
A good 'Sugar'-ish support,
whose name I didn't catch were
followed swiftly by A I C in
powerful form, 'Dam That River',
'We Die Young' assaulting the
senses, and a frenetic pit in the
Underworld's claustrophobic
confines drawing me in, not
unwillingly.
New bass player, Michael Inez
fits in well, and the bottom-heavy
rather superb even when the band's
bored out of their collective skull,
and my new Scorpio T-shirt does
glow in the dark rather nicely. In
fact it's much better in the dark than
it is in daylight where it just sits and
looks turquoise, and clashes with
my Scorpio Rash. So all in all, not
too bad a night, and the spots have
almost gone now.

rhythm section chug drives the
songs in their unconventional
directions. New album 'Dirt' has an
ambiguous stance, is it pro or anti-
smack? Whatever viewpoint it
takes, the consequences are made
blatantly clear, and. material like
'Junkhead' and 'Angry Chair'
makes bleak statements, for you to
interpret as you please. The killer
blow is 'Man In A Box', and the
Underworld Saturday curfew leaves
us with a short set, and no encore,
but short and sharp suits this band
so much better than overblown ego-
trips anyway.

Albums
Alice in Chains: Would you let your daughter near this band?
St E t i e n n e — S o , tough
What planet? The first words on this
album are 'cigarette, a cup of tea,
a bun', leading to Sarah Cracknell
going on to sing about Kentish
Town tube and the Racing Post like
a post kitsch 'Tom's Diner', before
the first minute is out, and so on to
'did you see the K L F last night?'.
With sixties/seventies soundbite
frenzy, St Etienne oddball their own
way out of their personal pop tree
and into something altogether more
peculiar, tunnelling deeper as their
album progresses, until at the very
end, a vaguely eighties theme pops
up, sort of new romantic, and then
back to the cafe, for the last words
'chicken soup'. 'Mario's Cafe', that
first track and the forthcoming
single 'Hobart's Paving' ('Do you
think a girl should go to bed with
a fella if he doesn't love her?') are
the highlights—and what's more,
this albums seems to possess
reverse second album syndrome—
i.e. it's better than the first.
'So, Tough' is head, shoulders
and most of upper torso above
'Foxbase Alpha', and that was
pretty much the dog's bollocks. The
difficult third album should be a
solid stunner.
