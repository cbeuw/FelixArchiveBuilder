Not losing your RAG!
Ents is back! Contrary to popular
belief, we're still going to be with
you every Wednesday and Friday
night. So, after our well-deserved
break, we're ready to give you
some of the best, cheapest and
highest quality entertainment in
London.
This Friday sees the return of
Atmosphere. As well as the usual
lucky bag of Ents goodies, we've
got a God amongst London DJs.
The original—Norman Jay. The
Kiss F M DJ is gracing the hallowed
ground of our beloved Union and
he'll be playing the finest club tunes
around. He's played at the Bass
Clef, Shake your finger pop,
Talkin' Loud and he'll have you
frugging and grooving like you
never knew you could. And yet
again, we're cutting prices to only
£1 (Ents Card Holders Free). Let's
face it you'd be paying at least a
fiver anywhere else to hear him DJ.
All that and a bar 'til lam, disco 'til
2am and Smile Zone Happy Hour
8.30pm-10.00pm). As usual there
will be N O READMISSION. You
just can't beat the feeling.
Andy.
NeXT.RIP.
