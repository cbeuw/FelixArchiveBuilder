Coffee
Debate
The newly up and running Debating
Society, after a rather hesitant start,
is now firing on all cylinders. This
coming Tuesday (and hopefully
every other Tuesday after that) we
will be holding a public debate. This
time the motion 'This House
believes that Financial Aid to the
Third World is counterproductive'
will be debated. Main speakers are
from the Third World First and
Conservative Societies.
These speakers however only set
the ball rolling for the floor debate
which is your chance to show the
wisdom of Solomon and the
erudition of Mark Anthony. It is
this floor debate that will make the
event tick and so we need you to

year's The Macallan/Decanter
University Malt Taster of the Year,
held on Burn's Night at the Oxford
take part in a structured but
informal and often vigorous
discussion (followed by a good deal
less structured and more vigorous
discussion in the bar). So if you feel
strongly about this topic (on either
side) or you just enjoy winding up
those who get too politically correct
come along to the Brown
Committee Room (top floor of the
Union Building) at 7.30pm on
Tuesday 16th February.
If you cannot make it but would
like to take part in future or have
any burning issue that you would
like to be debated, please contact

Having won the Southern heat of
the competition held at Imperial last
term, Martin faced finalists from
Cambridge, Edinburgh, Leeds and
York, to battle it out in a series of
complex nosing challenges for this
year's title.
The winning nose belonged to
Marcus Walden from Leeds
University, who was presented with
The diagram below shows how
much of the price of an average jar
of coffee goes to those who produce
the crop, only about 8%. This is
because the coffee market is
dominated by several large coffee
companies who keep the cost of the
primary product low, as a
consequence many of the coffee
farmers live in abject poverty and
many are forced to abandon their
plantations.
Oxfam and several other
'alternative trading organisations'
have therefore launched a new
mass-produced coffee which returns
22% of the retail price to the
growers. This is Cafedirect, a high
quality coffee produced in Mexico,
Costa Rica and peru. Cafedirct is
a £250 cheque, 6 bottles of The
Macallan 18 year-old and a one year
subscription to Decanter
magazine—not a bad reward for an
afternoon off lectures smelling
whisky.
Remember that the Imperial
College Union Wine Tasting
Society meets every Tuesday at
6pm in the Union Building. Still to
come this year:
available in Oxfam shops and is
now starting to be stocked by the
large supermarket chains. This will
be the first product to be launched
bearing the Fairtrade Mark, this is
a mark which guarantees a product
is paying its producers (both in the
Third World and here) a fair wage
and providing acceptable working
conditions.
ICU Third World First and a
local Oxfam campaign group will
be providing information on fair
trade and a chance to try Cafedirect
in the JCR on Thursday 18th
February from 10 till 2, a taste is
free and a cup is only lOp, and if
you really like it packs are for sale.
So come along and drink to a fairer
world.
16 Feb—Valentines Sparkling
23 Feb—Burgundy
9th March—Rhone
12th March—Spanish
Although we cannot guarantee
that you will go on to be Taster of
the Year, we are confident that you
will get something out of every
tasting evening. Tastings cost £3-£5
and membership for the year is only
£5.
