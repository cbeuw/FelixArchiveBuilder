Sultans of Ping F C —

'Yippee!', said me. 'At last the long
awaited album from the Sultans of
Ping!', and immediately ran home
to listen to it. Well, what did I
think? I liked it. I didn't love it
though. The songs are well groovy
and don't seem to lose too much for
being studio tracks rather than the
live versions I'm used to.
'Veronica', 'Kick me with your

I'm sure there's some kind of Sony
corporate tax thing involved here.
August records (not Elektra,
whatever you read elsewhere),
Creation's sub-label, evidently have
a brief to sign the oddest bands on
the planet on the assumption that
they couldn't possibly sell. Look at
their track"record (no pun intended).
They sign Shonen Knife. Then they
sign Ween...picture the scene in
accounts...
'Listen to this Ween band.
Couldn't possibly sell! Sign them.
That'll stop us having to pay tax on
the new Terence Trent D'Arby
album.
'Yes, that'll sure be a massive
seller. He's so spot on.'
Accountants! Suckers! Wrong
again, boys. 'Pure Guava' is a very
strange album indeed and it sounds
like everything from Paul Young to
Neil Young; from Musical Youth
to Sonic Youth; consequently it is
the only album you ever need to
buy.

leather boots', 'Where's Me
Jumper?', most of the classics are
included, but unfortunately my two
favourites namely 'The Little
Turnipfish' and 'Football Hooligan'
are not. However, my favourite
track off the album has to be
'Shopping': 'pull on your flip-flops
and let's go shopping, dear'—
appeals to my mentality and says a
lot about theirs.
FOB.

Jimi Jam and Terry Lewis—the
producers responsible for this
album are also to blame for
producing such artists as Janet
Jackson and they must have had
more than enough time to put this
bland collection together in their
tea-half-hour.
Is black soul music ever going to
advance beyond a jumble of over-
used cliches? This has just about
confirmed for me the stereotyped
image of black male sole artists who
sing from their groin. For example
how can you take this stuff
seriously? 'Girl let me take you to
where you want to be' and 'Baby
I want to get inside you' ooooh,
yeah.
I didn't get far enough into this
album to hear the line 'all night
long' but I'm sure it's in there
somewhere. But to be quite honest
this wouldn't get me past taking off
my white sling-back stillettos.

• 'Love Makes No Sense' is
released on A & M now.
So, the T&C's going to close. So
what, who cares? It's not as if they
haven't had two years notice of the
owners intentions (Murphy told
them they would have to move out
on the 25th March two years ago).
Did they expect to be able to get
another stay of execution like they
did before? Wouldn't it have been
wiser to have spent the last two
years looking for a new place
instead of just the last two months?
And is the T&C really that good a
venue. Sure, it puts on good
concerts, but that can hardly be put
down to the club, it's due to the
promoters. The view in parts of the
club can be restricted, due to the
bizarre floor layout, unlike the other
comparable sized venues in
London, the Astoria, the Academy,
and the Apollo, not that they are
without their faults. The Grand in
Clapham, shortly to be opened to
full capacity is a beautiful venue.
And don't you think it a little
hypocritical of bands like Carter et
al to protest against the closure,
when only a year ago, they were
criticising the T&C policy of adding
25% to T-shirt prices. That then
usually rounds itself up to £3 on top
of a ten pound T-Shirt. I'm sure the
cost of these things, the
memorabilia is of more importance
to most concert goers than whether
they see a band in Kentish Town or
Clapham.
The T&C's closure won't stop
bands coming to London, that
would be commercial suicide, it'll
just send them to other venues.
As for the T&C2, it's one of the
few really bad small venues. Most
pub back rooms are better equipped
and the ceiling is too low to see the
band from the bar. London already
has plenty of small venues, and
some of the are pitifully underused.
The Mean Fiddler's Subterania is
a case in. point.
The T & C are not the
unblemished guardians of rock 'n'
roll that people make them out to
be.
