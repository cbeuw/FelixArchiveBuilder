Latest from the Square Mile
Numaan Chaudhry presents an update of popular indices and news of the latest IPOs
World stocks
European stocks closed
higher on Thursday, as data
showed the US economy grew
more quickly than earlier
reported, even as oil prices
hovered above $51 a barrel.
The gains came despite a
poor showing from British
banks, which tumbled after
Barclays warned of growing
credit card debt.
The Dow Jones Stoxx 600
Index, which tracks Europe’s
600 largest listed companies,
rose 1.85 points to 266.33, and
the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx
Index, which tracks compa-
nies in countries that partici-
pate in the euro, rose 2.17 to
281.51. The Dow Jones Euro
Stoxx 50 Index rose 26.2 to
3086.1, and the Dow Jones
Stoxx 50 Index rose 15.6 to
2927.0.
The German DAX 30 Index
rose 1.1%, or 47.06, to 4436.60
and the French CAC 40 Index
rose 37.01 to 4137.28. The UK
FTSE 100 index rose 23.4 to
4994.9.
The Dow Jones Stoxx 50
rose 0.5%, with oil compa-
nies such as Total among top
gainers as light sweet crude-
oil contracts traded at $51
a barrel. Mining stocks like
BHP Billiton also advanced
strongly.
The euro was weaker, down
0.7% at $1.2512, as US gross
domestic product data for the
first quarter was revised to
show a 3.5% rise.
Barclays closed down 4%
after saying it now expects
bad debt for 2005 to be some-
what higher than its last pub-
lished risk tendency.
The bank said a slowdown
across the UK consumer
credit sector resulted in a
rise in potential credit risk
loans and a resulting increase
in impairment losses. The
increase in delinquencies
was most noticeable in credit
cards, the company said.
The warning hit other
UK banks, with Royal Bank
of Scotland down 3.2% and
Lloyds TSB falling 1.7%.
Continuing the weak
UK consumer theme was
home improvement retailer
Kingfisher, which said first
quarter sales rose 2.2%
to £1.94bn (€2.82bn), but
dropped 5.6% on a compara-
ble basis, as early Easter and
poor spring weather affected
the main consumer busi-
nesses in the UK and France.
Kingfisher shares rose 1.8%.
CEO Gerry Murphy said
on a conference call that
Kingfisher isn’t in takeover
talks. “We have no plans to
break up this business and
are not in discussions with
anybody about anything like
that. I don’t you think you
make life-changing decisions
on the back of a few weeks’
difficult trading,” he said.
Current UK conditions are
expected to continue for some
time, he added.
China’s Latest IPOs
During the next six weeks,
four big Chinese companies
are going to hit global inves-
tors with more than $8bn
(€6.36bn) in new-stock sales,
including the year’s biggest
initial public offering (IPO), at
a time when IPOs around the
world have performed dis-
mally and as trading volumes
across Asia have dried up.
Even with China’s economy
cruising along at a growth
rate of 9.5%, fund managers
say, these companies -- two
banks, a coal company and a
shipping concern -- may have
to price their stock cheaply to
draw investors stung by this
year’s raft of sinking IPOs.
That means cheap valuations
and interesting opportunities,
they say.
Companies will have to
“scale back their expecta-
tions and climb down from
their high horse,” says Bratin
Sanyal, head of Asian equi-
ties for ING Investment
Management. “Appetite for
Asian equities at this stage is
less than before.”
The daily average value
of shares traded on Hong
Kong’s stock exchange this
month is down 27% from the
first quarter, amid concerns
over a global economic slow-
down, rising interest rates
and currency volatility. Equity
issuance by Asian companies,
excluding those in Japan, is
down 20% so far this year
from a year earlier, accord-
ing to market-data provider
Dealogic.
Three-quarters of the 28
new listings in Singapore
this year have fallen below
their offer price. The latest,
Biosensors International
Group, which was listed on
May 20, saw its shares sink
39% on its first day of trading
after being priced near the
bottom end of an indicative
range.
The trend spans the globe.
Earlier this month, Boise
Cascade in the US yanked
its $400 million offering, fail-
ing to find a suitable price
even after lowering the offer
range. High-profile stock
offers by Lazard and Warner
Music Group in the US have
both fallen below their offer-
ing price.
Investment bankers say
each of the four big Chinese
companies coming to market
will be different enough from
the pack to attract investors,
and that there are enough
investors sitting on cash,
waiting for the right oppor-
tunity, to absorb this flood of
stock. Indeed, these offerings
have long been in the works,
and that in itself can generate
excitement among investors.
Furthermore, IPOs in Hong
Kong haven’t fared so badly
this year, with eight of the 12
new stocks above offer price,
though the number of new
issues is half what it was a
year earlier.
Still, the quartet of issuers
have their work cut out for
them in this environment.
Even a banker involved in one
of the four offerings acknowl-
edged that “in terms of [the
billions of dollars of] equity
you see coming to the market
in the next six weeks, it looks
very challenging.”
Holding back for richer
times isn’t an option for China,
which churns out multibillion-
dollar IPOs of state-owned
enterprises every year. That is
in part because Chinese com-
panies have limited options
for raising cash. Banks have
cut back on lending, and the
country’s domestic stock mar-
kets are among the world’s
worst-performing, each down
about 17% this year. Two of
the companies set to list soon,
China Shenhua Energy and
Bank of Communications,
had planned to raise money
on the domestic markets but
dropped the idea because of
the market’s poor perform-
ance.
The biggest new listing out
of China so far this year is
Shanghai Electric Group,
which raised $648m in April.
Its shares fell on the first day
of trading and have since
edged back up around their
offer price.
The final company com-
ing to market is China Cosco
Holdings, which last week
received approval from the
Hong Kong stock exchange to
go ahead with its initial stock
sale valued at between $1.5
bn and $2bn. The shipping
company will begin sounding
out investors today.
“At the end of the day,
what you are going to see
is the pricing is going to be
very realistic,” says Flavia
Cheong, a fund manager at
Aberdeen Asset Management
in Singapore. “It’s worth tak-
ing a look.”
