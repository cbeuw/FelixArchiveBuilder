OPERA
The latest international opera
superstar to tread the boards at
the Royal Opera House is the world
renowned Cecilia Bartoli. In a sea-
son that has already seen the cream
of operatic talent come to London,
the pace is definitely not letting up.
Along with Bartoli, Zhang, Villazon
and Fleming are still to come.
Bartoli will be appearing in
Rossini’s Il Turco in Italia. she
takes the role of Fiorilla, who inevi-
tably will be the eponymous Turco’s
love interest. As you can expect, the
plot is full of confusion and intrigues
which are all resolved amongst
much comedy. (Yes, opera can be
and often is really very funny).
Apart from the fact that an evening
of Italian opera is hard to beat for
entertainment value, this produc-
tion is new and in the hands of two
directors who have had great suc-
cess with Rossini opera.
And above all, Bartoli is a stupen-
dous artist. She manages to make
her voice do things that any other
human being could only dream about
– her range is fabulous, classed as a
mezzo-soprano, she has a good bot-
tom register and astounding range
and clarity at the top of her voice.
She breezes through immeasurably
treacherous passages with such
agility that if there ever was an
advertisement for good technique, it
must be her.
The opera runs until 11 June and
some tickets are still available, so I
heartily urge you try to see it. Day
seats are a good option if you don’t
mind queuing early in the morning.

New York’s Museum of Modern Art launches a curious new experiment
RADIO
WSP1 is hardly the most revealing
of names. To be honest, it could
allude to just about anything from a
government defence programme to
the name of a new games console,
however, it is actually the name of
the world’s first and only internet
arts radio station. And what a crea-
tive name it is at that.
This radio station is an initiative
of the New York Museum of Modern
Art (MoMA) and bills itself as a
‘censorship free zone’ where the
arts can be showcased and explored
in a unique way. The station can
be reached through its website
www.wsp1.org. Programmes are
scheduled to cover music, poetry,
discussion and comment on impor-
tant arts events across the world.
While this may sound like a noble
mission on which to embark (using
Bloomberg’s money), I can’t say I’m
sold on the product. Having come
across the station while trying to
find out about another arts event,
and having since revisited it, the
quality of the programming doesn’t
really seem to justify its existence.
On my first visit I was treated to
some very ‘interesting’ music which
I can’t say anyone wishing to remain
sane could have listened to for more
than about five or ten minutes –
depending on the listener’s initial
state of mind. On my next visit, I
was treated to a reading on the
subject of airports and airplanes. It
took me a while to realise that this
wasn’t one of those irritating, poetic
‘Visit Australia’ commercials. Again,
hardly impressive; I may be a suck-
er for punishment, but I do feel that
I should give the station one last
chance – three strikes and it’s out.
I may not be the greatest fan of
more conceptual forms of art – such
as that most frequently found on the
schedule of WSP1 – but I don’t hate
it and I often find it quite intriguing
and interesting (used in this case in
the positive sense). However, I do
think that it is most successful when
it couples forms media together:
sound with moving images, photog-
raphy with the written word, even
a giant rug with an accompany-
ing series of video images (yes, it
sounds ridiculous, but I have seen
it). What WSP1 manages to present
is, at best, an incomplete product.
If such art forms do really inter-
est you, your time would be much
better spent at the Institute of
Contemporary Art (ICA, www.ica.
org), the Tate Modern (www.tate.
org), or at any number of galleries
throughoutthecountryandtheworld.
In fact, the Nordic countries and the
Baltic states, in particular Finland,
do some truly awe-inspiring shows.

queues of biblical proportions; WSP1 has no queues

MUSICALS
When it comes to musicals, I’m
stuck in something of a time warp.
To put it bluntly, anything premiered
much after 1960 isn’t really my thing.
Though I must say with great disap-
pointment that Urinetown, a new
musical, still hasn’t made it to the
West End from Broadway. However,
what has made it back to the London
stage is Guys and Dolls.
This latest revival of Frank
Loesser’s 1955 musical is going to
be the ‘must see’ of the season. With
a score packed with great tunes and
a cast that would make any other
show envious, it’s really not hard to
see why. Ewan McGregor, who has
obviously been bitten by the song
and dance bug following Moulin
Rouge and Down With Love, is back
on the West End stage, accompa-
nied by the Tony Award winning Ally
McBeal actress Jane Krakowski.
The story centres on McGregor’s
character, Sky Masterson, a small
time gambler, and a bet that he can’t
make the next girl he sees fall in
love with him. Clearly we’re not talk-
ing about deeply intellectual stuff
here – just entertainment. Evidently,
problems arise from the identity of
the next girl Masterson sees and so
comedy and song and dance num-
bers will of course follow.
This show should be good, and
so far the reviews to emerge from
the previews stage have been very
promising. Unfortunately, booking
tickets looks like it can only be done
in person or over the phone, as every
website I tried was less than helpful,
to put it mildly. However, for general
show information the official show
website, www.guysanddollsthemusi-
cal.com, is very good. It also looks
great and has a lot of excerpts from
the score so you can have a taster of
what you’re going to see.
