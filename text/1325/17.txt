Football women in grudge match
Imperial Women
(current girls) 5
Imperial Women
(X-girls) 4
At the end of a not so good
season for the IC Women’s
Football team there was one
victory to top all the defeats!
The current team defeated
the best of the former players
– or ‘X-girls’ – in a narrow 5-4
victory that was filled with
tension from start to finish.
The match began with both
teams very nervous, vying for
the much sought after ‘mixing
bowl’ trophy with its alcoholic
beverage! Both teams were
at a numerical disadvantage
and so were evenly matched
at seven-a-side with no resi-
dent goalies.
Kathy took advantage of
the X-girls’ empty net from
afar with clinical precision
and put the current IC team
ahead after ten minutes of
tense play. This was followed
by a sudden counter-attack
from formidable X-girl Maria,
who abandoned any passing
malarkey and booted it from
the halfway line into the goal.
No messing!
There were amazing skills
on the pitch from both teams
and the score was even until,
with a trademark run, Chin
took on the opposition sin-
gle-handed and finished by
beautifully sliding the ball
home, putting the current
girls up by two goals to one.
This was followed by another
current girls attack, this time
from the season’s top scor-
er Aysha, taking on all the
defenders and setting herself
up for a little tap across the
goal line!
Mel and Helene put the
‘grr’ into ‘grudge match’ and
reminded us of how it used to
be done with some crunching
tackles.
The current girls, feeling
a bit too confident with their
3-1 lead, couldn’t handle a
counter-attack from last sea-
son’s club captain Lou, who
brought the X-girls back in
the game at 3-2 behind. But
Aysha did the team proud yet
again and got another goal
for the current girls, bringing
the score to 4-2.
With some great passing
between the immensely skil-
ful X-girls Nona and Sophie,
the ball was kept away from
any of the current girls, end-
ing in a great through ball to
Clare and another goal to cut
the deficit to 4-3.
The teams were getting
tired and over an hour had
passed of continuous and
intense play. The X-girls
wanted to carry on until they
equalised to try to regain
some dignity, but current girl
Mor put those dreams of vic-
tory to bed with an amazing
goal after skilful defending
by Alex and beautiful passing
from Saz.
The X-girls ended the
match with a valiant attack
from the whole team, end-
ing with stunning goal from
Nona.
Both teams should be
proud, as the skills displayed
on the pitch showed that IC
ladies are still shaking that
ass! Celebrations followed in
the form of straws, alcohol
and a trophy! We finished the
day with the annual dinner
at Le Piaf, Putney and then
on to Fez, ending the season
with a victory and lots of fun!
