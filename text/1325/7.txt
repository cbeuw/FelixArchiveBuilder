Library crisis revisited
Dear Dave,
I wholeheartedly endorse the com-
ments of my anonymous colleague
(‘Library crisis’, Felix 19 May). But
what an extraordinary reply from
the Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, in the
same issue. That he ‘reacts with a
smile’ is offensive, sad… and typi-
cal. That people (ie critics of what
currently goes on the IC library
world) ‘have to move with the times’
shows how little he knows of the
current situation. Has he actually
visited the central library through
the night to see what tiny fraction of
the student population is using it…
and how? Has he visited early in
the morning to see the mess, rang-
ing from pizza boxes and towers of
empty beer bottles to smelly socks
and sleeping bags? Has he called in
during the day to see how many stu-
dents can find neither table at which
to work or chair to sit on due to the
amount of personal possessions left
by camping students who have gone
home for a snooze but are treating
the central library like a hotel so
they can keep their own table for
weeks on end? Yes, all this ‘does
make the place a bit different’; good
of you to notice, sir. Good of you to
acknowledge, too, that ‘WE have to
deal with that at the moment’. Why
was there absolutely no anticipa-
tion of the likely problems by man-
agement this year after the similar
mess of 2004?
And into this scenario it is aimed
to decant yet more departmental
libraries. Add to this the fact that
the number of IC students increases
each year, and that IC aims to move
its humanities department into level
5 thereby reducing current library
space. ‘We have to consolidate as
many of the departmental libraries
as possible’ says the rector because
such moves are ‘in the best interests
of students … That’s what students
want’. Few students avail them-
selves of 24/7 opening but render
the central library unpleasant at
best and unusable at worst for the
majority. So, ‘in their best interests’,
Sir Richard? I think not.
One wonders, when one hears that
24/7 was the most requested change
to library services from students,
just how many actually called for
it. Surely they had a right to expect
there would be proper planning for
it. Could it be that the rector has
seen 24/7 opening at ivy league col-
leges in the US where, firstly, stu-
dents show so much respect for their
‘alma mater’; secondly, they are all
very clear about rights and respon-
sibilities; thirdly, security staff have
very clear rules which they have an
absolute right to enforce; fourthly,
management not only give every
support to security staff to imple-
ment best practice, they actually
stick their collective heads above
the parapet for once and show some
signs of knowing how the library is
being so abused, and show some
genuine concern.
With departmental libraries in the
central library, with more students,
and with 24/7 opening, next year
promises to be worse – much worse.
By which time Sir Richard will be
off, and staff and future students will
just have to live with it, won’t they?
Another central library librarian
Dear Editor,
I would like to follow up all the recent
articles about the libraries and the
state of the service. Clare Jenkins,
the Director of Library Services,
invited all the student reps to an
informal meeting this evening to
discuss the problems experienced
over this year. It was an incredibly
useful discussion if only to highlight
the fact that students had some-
thing worthwhile to say and that
they were also willing to listen to
other side of the story.
The Mech Eng library closure has
been well publicised and strongly
fought. Clare was happy to divulge
the 10 year plan of the library which
would infact mean that closure of
all departmental libraries within
the next ten years. She also wants
to make sure that everyone knows
that this is the plan instead of the
shock tactics used by Mech Eng to
make the inevitable hurt more. She
was also keen to prove to us that
she was acutely aware of the need
for study space and adequate study
conditions. The discussion touched
on the ventilation and heating in
the central library, the litter and
smell during the 24/7 hour season,
the noise and the recent problem of
desk hogging. The ICSM Rep also
added that the opening hours at
Charing Cross were not adequate
for 4th years onwards who spend
all summer studying for exams,
and opening times during holidays,
especially Christmas time.
It was a well attended meeting
showing that the students obviously
care about their library service. We
know this is true from all the arti-
cles in Felix recently about vari-
ous aspects of the library. However
students need to be made aware
that they must feedback to the
library how they feel so things can
be changed. Opening hours surveys
are being conducted at the moment
and there are plans to get under-
graduate representation on a regu-
lar committee meeting. And did you
know that if you cannot find your
core textbook there is a link to tell
them directly? (www.imperial.ac.uk/
library and go to contacts, feedback
link.) This means that Clare then
has the vital student voice in push-
ing what WE want to have and not
letting decisions obliviously go on
around us or problems unnoticed.

An alternative to fees
Dave,
In your last comment piece, you
said that Top-Up Fees campaigners
should have put forward alternative
funding strategies. We did!
I remember one exceedingly
long Union Council meeting in
2002 where Etienne Pollard, along
with the rest of the Top-Up Fees
Working Group, did exactly that!
In fact Union Council eventually
plumped for the alternative funding
model of restructuring higher edu-
cation and removing the target of
50% of young people going into HE,
alongside creating more vocational
course places. This model had been
costed by us and public opinion had
been sought.
It wasn’t just us that were putting
forward this model though; the
Government’s own white paper on
HE funding discussed this model
and indicated that it was a less
financially onerous option for the
individual and society. Despite all
the evidence available in support
of this model, the Government still
went ahead with Top-Up Fees.
It’s all very well having an alterna-
tive, but if the powers that be don’t
want to listen then they won’t.
Yours,
Katherine McGinn

Welfare) 2003-4
Dave Edwards, Editor, replies:
I did not mean to criticise
Imperial’s response to the introduc-
tion of top-up fees; rather my com-
ments were aimed at protesters
nationally, such as the NUS, who I
felt had sent a strong “no to fees”
message without giving the same
emphasis to whatever alternatives
they favoured.
Rebranding the Rector
Sir,
My proposal is to harmonise the
senior management structure of the
College with the ‘clear and uncom-
plicated’ rebranding exercise insti-
gated by the Rector in 2003. The
next phase of rebranding would tar-
get other aspects of the college from
a ‘bygone age’ – such as Sir Richard
himself.
“I think it would be a good move
forward”saidAugustusPlantagenet-
Bolingbrooke, one advocate of the
new phase of rebranding. “If you
were to look at a page with the
Rector’s name on it you would see a
nice modern ‘Dick, Rector’ without
having to read all this other stuff
about ‘Sir Richard Sykes DSc FRS,
Rector of Imperial College’.”
The rebranding would mean that
Sir Richard, after receiving his
Knighthood in the 1994 New Year’s
Honours list, would not use any of his
titles in the majority of publications.
“It wouldn’t mean that we would dis-
card Sir Richard’s Knighthood, or
his Fellowship of the Royal Society,
his Honorary Fellowship of the Royal
Society of Chemistry, Fellowship of
the Academy of Medical Sciences,
Fellowship of Imperial College of
Medicine, Fleming Fellowship of
Lincoln College, Oxford; nor his
Honorary Doctorate in Pharmacy
from the University of Madrid;
his Honorary Doctor of Science
degrees from the universities of
Brunel, Cranfield, Imperial, Bristol,
Edinburgh, Hertfordshire, Hull,
Huddersfield, Leeds, Leicester,
Newcastle, Sheffield, Strathclyde,
Warwick or Westminster, they would
just be used for special occasions.”
It is noted that Sir Richard worked
incredibly hard to obtain doctorates
from all these universities, partly
by employing scientific methods in
the business world. For example,
as chairman of the remuneration
committee at Rio Tinto in April 2003,
he used a very scientific method in
the calculation of the 22% increase
(from £46,000 to £56,000) in remu-
neration of Rio Tinto non-executive
directors, including himself. The
algorithm used was undoubtedly
very advanced, since the adjusted
share price of Rio Tinto fell some 7%
in the previous year of 2002.
“We haven’t actually done a sur-
vey of the Rector, or the students,
but I think it would be an interest-
ing concept, if Dick turned out to be
unbelievably conservative himself
and rejected the proposals...” said
Augustus.
Highlights of the proposals:
• Sir Richard Sykes would hence-
forth be referred to as ‘Dick, Rector’
or simply ‘Dick’, use of the abbrevia-
tion ‘Sir D’ should be discouraged.
• A new website would be created,
called ‘e-Rector’, to help the college
understand the new guidelines for
rebranding.
• The new phase of rebranding con-
cept will be paid for by ‘Dick’ in the
same way that the college paid for
itself to be rebranded by an incred-
ibly expensive image consultancy
firm.

Letters to the Editor
By the techforum team
Ever been in a situation where you
need specific technical advice in an
area outside your field of expertise?
Ever wondered what research goes
on in various departments across
college? Ever wanted to team up
with people having complimentary
skills to develop an innovative idea?
If the answer is “yes” to any of these
questions then read on...
In March this year, a new techni-
cal discussion forum – techforum –
was launched with the broad objec-
tive of providing an informal means
of technical information exchange
throughout college. techforum is
open to staff and students alike and
requires registration to post mes-
sages. Since launch, the site has
attracted approximately 265 regis-
tered users from all campuses and
a wide range of departments. Once
a ‘critical mass’ of registered users
is established, the site will provide
an excellent platform for connecting
people for anything ranging from
technical information exchange to
networking for teambuilding and
innovation. With time, techforum will
help to remove perceived bounda-
ries between research groups and
increase the visibility of interdis-
ciplinary activities at Imperial to
stimulate a more synergistic envi-
ronment for teaching and research.
