Exams are like pieces of string.
Each piece of string is holding you
up, high above the real world. The
more strings there are, the less
pressure there is on each one.
Each time you sit an exam, a string
breaks, bringing you closer to free-
dom down below. Once the final
string snaps, away you go. Whether
you land on your head or on your
feet depends on the way the strings
break.
Taking the analogy a little further,
some may say too far, some strings
could be elastic, so that just when
you think you are free and away, you
bounce back and have to do resits.
By the time you read this, my final
string will have broken and I shall
be free and falling through the nine
circles of project hell.
Strings can be used in so many
analogies. Life is like a piece of
string, floating in the wind.
Sometimes turbulently, sometimes
calmly. Sometimes two pieces of
string can become tangled together,
either briefly, or knotted forever.
Relationships are like string, tying
you down, impinging upon your free-
dom to go drinking with your mates
or have sex with many, many beauti-
ful women. But also, like string, they
can be a source of strength. Two
objects tied together are stronger
than one.
As I sit here nursing a hangover
and thinking about string, my mind
drifts to the three questions posed
last week by Miss Woods. What is
my definition of a slut? What about
promiscuous males? What is your
world when you are asleep or under
anaesthetic?
My definition of a slut is, coinci-
dently, the same as the OED’s defi-
nition of a slut. Great minds think
alike eh? “A woman characterised
by many transient sexual relation-
ships.” In case I caused offence to
the undefiled Stormy, it should be
noted that I only said she sounds
like a slut, and that I was not casting
judgment, since to do so would be to
invite judgment to be cast upon me.
Secondly, promiscuous males do
not, as far as I am aware, get their
own word. So I will invent one and
hope it catches on: ‘snut’. I don’t
know very many snuts. I’m not par-
ticularly enthusiastic about the idea.
That’s about all I think of it. People
can do whatever the hell they like
just as long as it doesn’t bug me.
And finally, I’ve never been under
anaesthetic, but when I am asleep
my world becomes filled with choco-
late boxes and roses. Fields of daf-
fodils. Shooting stars flying through
the Milky Way. A world of happiness
and natural beauty.
You see, relationships aren’t
about sex. Sex to relationships is
like cream to strawberries. Just the
right amount can be nice, too much
is sickly, and strawberries are damn
nice with none at all (drinking cream
on the other hand...).
Do you know what the human
body goes through when you have
sex? Pupils dilate, arteries constrict,
core temperature rises, heart races,
blood pressure skyrockets, respi-
ration becomes rapid and shallow,
the brain fires bursts of electrical
impulse from nowhere to nowhere,
and secretions spit out of every
gland. And the muscles tense and
spasm like you’re lifting three times
your body weight. It’s violent, it’s
ugly and it’s messy.
Sex is like a superstring. Tiny
objects vibrating at various frequen-
cies with different amplitudes give
rise to a veritable zoo of particles
and life forms. And if we can figure
out how to link superstrings to a
theory of attraction, we will have
solved one of the greatest mysteries
of the universe.
In the meantime, remember some
wise words from CS Lewis: “Mortal
lovers must not try to remain at the
first step; for lasting passion is the
dream of a harlot and from it we
wake in despair.”
String theory
by AARON S
So now you know I don’t know any-
thing, read on.
I stand by my right to ask questions
without needing validity through the
promise of any answers. However,
answers are another part of the
whole process of our short experi-
ence in this consciousness. Asking
“why?” (though obviously many of
my questions do utilise the rest of
the magic ‘w’ words) is just a con-
tinual effort and a journey to repair
the blind subservience I have given
into at some points in my life. The
syndrome, I have witnessed time
and time again, of enslaving oneself
to the first experience, or first book,
or first philosophy that fell off the
shelf and hit us on the head. Asking
is good, it gives people the opportu-
nity to answer.
I went to a really interesting talk
last year with a priest, a rabbi and
an imam. Yes I had questions and
indeed the rabbi was lovely and
really respected what I was try-
ing to ask. Unlike how some may
see my presence, my questioning is
with all ears and mind open for the
answers. After asking some ques-
tions about hell (strictly speaking I
tend to always be heading towards
that elusive place, especially accord-
ing those jolly guys preaching in
Oxford street every time I go shoe
shopping), he said something very
true. Someone cannot be an atheist
while still looking. Does that mean
“being” anything means we are
closing ourselves off from discover-
ing? I cannot “be” an atheist if I am
still asking.
A point of information, I am
not an atheist in the conventional
sense. I think the imam was just
trying to reassure me about hell
and that I certainly still have hope.
My view is far more optimistic, I
always have hope. I am thinking
cryogenics.
Then there are those places
where questions are welcomed but
shrouded with sinister animosity. I
was at ‘discovery of Islam’ week and
before I knew it someone decided to
apologise to me for the bad feeling
arousing from my enquiries. I was
oblivious to becoming unpopular
and gladly so. Someone even sug-
gested that my being there was just
for the sake of asking something
– obviously they just didn’t under-
stand the intellectual content of the
queries posed.
What was actually interesting
to observe was the night that the
Christian society came and posed
their questions. It was almost amus-
ing to see the steam seething from
both sides like a modern day Tory-
Labour fight in the commons – so
much bickering over ultimately the
same underlying philosophy!
Hey, look… I know the differences
in the detail (the devil loves lying
there) but surely it is the same
God. What was really striking is
how the majority of the onlookers
were far more able to engage in the
debate between the Christian holy
trinity and Islamic interpretation
of it, than my delving enquiries.
Probably because my challenges
appealed to the part of the mind
that had died that day the book fell
off the shelf.
The answers I have faced so far
have had many forms. There are
those that are “rational” who love to
back up their arguments either with
philosophical science they dreamt
up in their sleep, or statistics they
grew in their back garden. Then of
course there are the “irrational”,
where the irrationality of the argu-
ment itself tends to be an argument
for it. The passionate “this is the
truth because I have found it and I
know it is true because I feel it in my
heart. Oh, and this book says so,” is
always a good one.
It is great listening to everything
and maybe sometimes it is predicta-
ble and a whole lot of bother. So why
do I persist? Because sometimes I
discover little gems and it delights
me. When I do ask, I am always pre-
pared for my humble intelligence to
be taken as a sign of easy prey and
before long I discover everybody has
the answers, except me!

Big Brother to blame for teen
pregnancy
Worthy government agencies are,
this week, blaming reality TV
shows such as Big Brother for the
rise in teenage pregnancies. The
UK currently holds the undesirable
title of teen pregnancy capital of
Europe.
The Brook Advisory centre stated
this week that the intense media
interest as to whether any of the
vacuous contestants have got
jiggy is to blame for teenage preg-
nancy.
Why shouldn’t we be interested
in the sexual antics of Big Brother
or Love Island contestants? Well,
for a start, its hardly intellectual
thought-provoking telly is it?
Perhaps we should be spending
our time engaged in more fulfill-
ing activity, like reading Ulysses.
Perhaps. But there are times when
you just want to mong out in front
of some mindless telly, the main
virtue of which is the very fact that
you don’t have to concentrate on
it. We are programmed to be inter-
ested in sex, so it would be a little
worrying if we suddenly lost inter-
est – the population is decreasing
as it is.
I believe it is too simplistic and,
perhaps, even contradictory to
blame Big Brother and other reality
TV for teen pregnancies. The UK
has twice as many teenage mothers
than France and Germany where
sex is omnipresent on TV screens,
to the extent that shampoo adverts
show more heaving bosoms than
hair.
In my opinion the perceived wis-
dom that talking about and exposing
children to sex encourages them to
engage in sexual congress is in fact
the reverse of what actually occurs
in practice. We have six times more
sprog-producing teens than the lib-
eral Dutch. When things are secre-
tive or hidden they become much
more intriguing and generate inter-
est, and this isn’t just the case with
sex.
Sex education is notoriously bad
in schools. It might have improved
somewhat now, but I didn’t get my
first sex ed class until year nine. I’m
from the south so it was probably
just in time, but it is still woefully
late.
This warning comes at a time of
reignited public debate in the wake
of the revelation that three sisters
in Derby all gave birth by the time
they were 16. Is it remotely con-
ceivable to blame Big Brother or
Celebrity Love Island for this baby
factory? The mother of the girls
blames schools and the govern-
ment for providing inadequate sex
education, and she may have a point.
But, if you were the mother, after
the first girl gave birth, wouldn’t
you sit her sisters down and spell
it out?
One could be cynical, like some
of the tabloids, and suspect that
girls with few prospects see becom-
ing pregnant as the only alternative
to a hand-to-mouth existence. The
three sisters are suspected to be
receiving more than £600 a week in
benefits.
