Cycling to college at 4.30am
on a Sunday is bad enough,
but when you are on your way
to an adventure race having
never done anything of the
sort before, you seriously ask
yourself what on earth you
are doing.
A few months ago I was
introduced to adventure rac-
ing.Teamsorsolocompetitors
orienteer around the coun-
tryside in a multi-sport event
based around trail running
and mountain biking, which
lasts in the order of hours to
days. Being familiar with run-
ning and cycling (but not tal-
ented in either), I wanted to
give it a go, and last week four
of us from Imperial entered a
‘Dynamic Adventure Race’ in
the Quantocks in Somerset. I
mean, how hard can a bit of
orienteering be?
Adventure racing has been
described as “the UK’s fastest
growing sport” (admittedly on
adventure racing websites),
but before the event I had
little idea of what to expect.
We competed in a ‘standard’
event aimed at newcomers,
which had time limits of two
hours for running and three
hours for cycling with a one
hour transition period (ie
eat Jaffa Cakes and rest as
much as you can) in between.
The aim was to visit as many
checkpoints as possible from
a multitude scattered in the
annoyingly hilly surrounding
area, although there were
complications such as differ-
ent score values which were
only revealed after the start
of the race.
To give more of an idea of
what it’s like, here’s how it
started. Arnaud and myself
began by going straight up
a brutal gradient, which
reduced us to more of an
embarrassing shuffle than a
run. Halfway up, I had the fun
and games of trying to find a
30cm long hidden stick based
on a grid reference. After ten
minutes of looking, I noticed
a solo competitor much older
than ourselves who we had
passed on the way up, exiting
the area in a different direc-
tion. Predictably, he had pro-
ceeded straight to the check-
point and expended far less
energy.
The run continued like this
for the next two hours, and
we admired some spectacu-
lar views on the way, even
managing enough words for
a debate about the utility of
waterproof socks (I’m buying
some after this). Surprisingly
we visited every checkpoint
and sprinted back to the start
location on time, cheered on
at the end by our friend who
had so easily found the mark-
er post earlier.
So we were leading as we
began the cycling, and I was
beginning to think this adven-
ture racing lark was easy. Big
mistake. My calves cramped
up and I had to be helped even
to collapse to the floor, where
I spent 15 minutes, probably
whinging in a less than manly
fashion. Anyone who has had
cramp like this will know what
I’m talking about, and if you
don’t then you are missing
nothing, but for the next three
hours I was forced to quickly
relax my calves every time
cramp threatened to paralyse
them.
Despite this, the mountain
biking was awesome fun, with
technical downhill forested
areas, where my technique
consisted of nothing more
than holding on and releasing
the brakes more, the mud-
dier it got. Our inexperience
showed in terms of our overall
position, as we concentrated
too much on scoring points,
meaning that we got back late
with a heavy deduction. This
really didn’t matter though,
and we finished a more than
respectable second overall,
with Imperial’s other pair
– Dan and Matthew – doing
brilliantly and winning the
whole thing.
The few walkers that we
passed certainly looked
amused by our exertions,
and you too may think this all
sounds like an idiotic thing to
do. In some respects I can’t
argue with that! But I found it
difficult to be stressed about
the little unimportant things
on Monday morning, having
pushed myself near my limits
the previous day. It’s like Ed
Norton said: after Fight Club,
everything else got the vol-
ume turned down. Adventure
racing was no fight club, and
is accessible to anyone who is
moderately fit, as was proved
by me managing to finish
a race. You may still think
I’m mad, but I urge anyone
tempted to give it a go: it is
not about extreme endurance
(at this level anyway).
Some highlights of the trip:
• Witnessing a student adven-
ture racer’s (Dan) breakfast
at 5am: Jaffa Cakes and a
value Swiss roll, washed down
with some value coke.
• Passing a herd of deer run-
ning in the opposite direction.
• Consulting the map and
realising we were taking the
high road (ie going uphill),
not the low road (down).
Numerous times.
• Sprinting up to a cairn in
misty and wet conditions
as bright sunshine abruptly
appeared (sounds pretty
cheesy – all I can say is give
it a go!)
• Chatting to other com-
petitors afterwards: I felt
strangely bonded to people
who had gone through the
same experience, and when
I was suffering with cramp
every person who passed by
enquired as to my health. One
random female competitor
even stopped to give me a calf
massage.
I heard somewhere that
being a talented endurance
athlete requires a deficit in
short term memory in order
to keep returning to the event!
I have great memories of my
first adventure race, and,
thinking about it, perhaps I
could manage that eight hour
race later in the year...
