Animal testing review published
A landmark report on animal testing guidelines was released last week. Jenny Jopson looks at
the findings and asks: how close are we to seeing the end of what some call ‘a necessary evil’?
It is condemned as immoral,
unnecessary and cruel by
those who oppose it, but for
many scientists, and indeed
anyone who pops a headache
pill, the use of animals in
research is a fact of life that
cannot be easily dismissed.
Animal experimenta-
tion is regulated by strict
Home Office guidelines,
but has not been formerly
reviewed in almost 20 years.
Last week’s publication of a
report into the use of animals
in research by the Nuffield
Council on Bioethics sees the
first review of the procedures
and status of the debate
since the Animals (Scientific
Procedures) Act of 1986.
The Ethics of Research
Involving Animals was pro-
duced by a Working Party of
academic and industry scien-
tists, philosophers, members
of animal protection groups,
and a lawyer, over a period
of two years. The diversity
of professions and viewpoints
within the working party
reflects the fact that this
issue is one that affects the
whole of society, and is not
confined purely to scientists
and strident anti-vivisection-
ists. The main focus of the
report is to introduce nuance
into a debate that has tradi-
tionally been very polarised
with respect to defenders and
opponents, and to encourage
wider public debate on an
issue that effects us all.
Nick Ross, a member of the
working party, argues that
there is an inherent incompat-
ibility in society’s approach to
the issue of animal research:
“While we consider ourselves
an animal-loving nation and
want to see less cruelty to
animals, we also want to live
in a risk-free society where
we can use a new cosmetic,
perfume or painkiller with
confidence.” He argued that
only greater public engage-
ment in the debate could
tackle these difficult issues.
The report recommended
further research into ‘the
three Rs’: refinement (a
decrease in the severity of
procedures), reduction (a
decrease in the number of
animals used) and replace-
ment (the substitution of liv-
ing animals with non-sentient
material such as tissue cul-
tures or computer models). It
also suggested that scientific
papers should include infor-
mation as to how the three Rs
had been implemented.
The report also has signifi-
cance for students of the bio-
medical sciences. Dr Lewis
Smith, of Syngenta CTL, com-
plains of the current shortage
of graduates willing to work
in the pharmaceutical indus-
try due to the negative image
of animal experiments. This
results in the loss to industry
of many talented scientists,
and necessitates more and
more recruitment from over-
seas. Research conducted by
the Wellcome Trust in 2001
found that women are less
willing than men to under-
take research involving ani-
mal experimentation, so fur-
ther advances in replacement
technologies could also help
to decrease the gender gap.
Frustratingly, the report in
itself has no legislative power,
and can only make recom-
mendations of changes in pro-
cedure. While a review of the
current situation was clearly
long overdue, and is to be
welcomed, further advances
now depend upon the actions
of external funding bodies.
And given the tight budg-
ets of research institutions,
diverting funds from direct
research in order to invest
in replacement technologies
may present its own prob-
lems.
The report hopes that,
ultimately, the need for live
animal experimentation can
be eliminated altogether.
However, current replace-
ment technologies still lag far
behind this ideal. We are not
in a position to abolish the use
of animals in research any
time soon, which is unlikely to
please the anti-vivisectionist
lobby. Indeed, we may never
be able to replace animals
entirely, but as is the case
with many things that may
ultimately elude us, there is
no reason not to try.
“This issue is one
that affects the whole
of society and is not
confined purely to
scientists and strident
anti-vivisectionists”
The Nuffield report emphasised the need to reduce animal suffering and find
replacement methods of testing that do not use animals
