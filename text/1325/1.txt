Student cyclist killed Tanaka
arrested
for fraud
By Dave Edwards
Editor
An Imperial College post-
graduate student was
killed in a road traffic acci-
dent while cycling in the
South Kensington area last
Wednesday.
Apijak Srivannavit, from
Thailand, was studying for
an MSc in environmental
engineering. It appears that
he was at the junction of
Queen’s Gate and Cromwell
Road when he was hit by a
coach.
Mr Srivannavit, who was 26,
hadadegreeinchemicalengi-
neering from Chulalongkorn
University in his home coun-
try. He worked as an engineer
at a petrochemical company
and for the Factory Control
and Inspection Bureau in
Bangkok before coming to
Imperial in October 2004.
Chris Cheeseman, course
director for the environmen-
tal engineering MSc, said:
“Although he had only been
at Imperial College for a rela-
tively short time, Apijak was
highly regarded both by his
fellow students and the aca-
demic staff. He was a highly
motivated, competent and
popular student, who always
appeared to be very happy.
He will be missed by all those
who had the pleasure of
knowing him.”
Mr Srivannavit was an
active member of Imperial
College Thai Society, which
has created a memorial web
page where dozens of people
have already paid tribute to
him. This can be found at
www.union.ic.ac.uk/osc/thai/
board/viewtopic.php?t=66.
Mr Srivannavit is the not
the first person at Imperial
College to suffer a tragic
death while cycling in the
Cromwell Road area. Less
than three months ago,
Thomas Sippel-Dau, an ICT
manager, was knocked off his
bicycle and killed by a 4x4
vehicle.
Ben Jefferys, acting chair-
man of the Imperial College
Bicycle Users’ Group, told
Felix: “Whilst it is possible
to regard a single death as
an aberration, two in close
succession indicate there is
something deeply wrong. We
must learn from these deaths
and strive to prevent future
repetitions.”
Mr Jefferys called on
Imperial students and staff to
uniteindemandingchangesto
Cromwell Road, reducing the
impact of dangerous motor
vehicles and better reflecting
its place in the cultural heart
of London. Practical advice
for cyclists and information
on campaigning are available
at www.union.ic.ac.uk/icbug/
cromwell.html.

Gary Tanaka, a highly suc-
cessful Imperial alumnus who
donated £27m to Imperial's
managementschool,hasbeen
arrested on fraud charges.
Mr Tanaka and his busi-
ness partner, Alberto Vilar,
have been held without bail,
accused of stealing $5m of
investors’ money and using it
to purchase racehorses and
fund philanthropic activities
such as the Tanaka Business
School.
Mr Tanaka gained an MSc
and PhD in applied math-
ematics at Imperial College
in 1970. He then went on to
become one of the world’s
most successful high tech-
nology investors. He found-
ed the money management
firm Amerindo Investment
Advisors, which currently
manages some $8bn.
Mr Tanaka, of Kingston,
Surrey, is perhaps best known
in Britain for his involve-
ment in horse racing. He has
owned several group one win-
ners, such as Rakti. American
authorities suspect that he
may have used investors’
money to buy at least three
thoroughbred racehorses,
including Don Incauto, Agata
and Fruhlingssturm.
Professor David Norburn
of Imperial College described
Mr Tanaka as “one of the
most exceptional entrepre-
neurs of our time, which
makes him the ideal role
model for many hundreds of
Imperial students.”
Mr Tanaka’s £27m gift is
the largest private donation
in the College's history. His
arrest, whether he is prov-
en guilty or not, is likely to
cause Imperial considerable
embarrassment and raise
speculation that the Business
School could have been fund-
ed through fraud.
