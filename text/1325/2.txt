Following a three month ban,
visitors to Da Vinci’s Bar in
Beit Quad will now be allowed
to smoke after 9pm on week-
day evenings and any time at
weekends. The ban remains
in place from 9am to 9pm
Monday to Friday for the rest
of the summer term.
Despite opposition from
some students and staff, a
complete ban on smoking was
introduced in the bar on a trial
basis beginning on 1 March.
Customers were encouraged
to submit their feedback via
the ‘Yoursay’ forms. The
response was mixed – more
positive comments were
received than negative ones,
but support for the ban was
not high enough to convince
the Union to introduce it on a
full-time basis.
Sameena Misbahuddin, the
Union’s Deputy President
(Finance and Services),
told Felix: “There’s no per-
fect solution so we’ve tried
to strike a balance. You can
still enjoy food without smoke
[because food is served until
8.30pm], but so many stu-
dents are used to smoking.”
Miss Misbahuddin said
that smoking is “less of an
issue” at weekends because
the bars are not as busy. The
ban meant that running costs
increased at weekends, as
extra staff were needed to
open the adjacent Union bar
where smoking was allowed.
Students are encouraged
to give their views on the
new arrangement using the
‘Yoursay’ forms.
Smoking ban lifted on
evenings and weekends
Having been banned for the last three months, smoking is once again allowed in Da Vinci’s Bar, but only at weekends or after 9pm on weekdays
Paddington
‘super
hospital’
plans
scrapped
By Rupert Neate
Plans for a flagship ‘super-
hospital’ which would have
replaced many of Imperial’s
teaching hospitals have been
scrapped as a result of gov-
ernment procrastination and
increasing costs.
The Paddington Basin
Project had been beset with
problems since its inception
in 1997, the latest being a
drastic hike in land costs from
£99 to £130m. This brings the
total cost of the project to
nearly £1bn, a burden too
high for the beleaguered
NHS to swallow. Scrapping
the project now wastes £10m
already spent on consultant
fees.
The planned ‘health cam-
pus’ would have seen services
transferred from the nearby
Harefield, Royal Brompton
and St Mary’s hospitals to the
site adjacent to Paddington
railway station. The project
had the full backing of Tony
Blair, who once called it
“imaginative and extraordi-
nary”.
Campaigners who were
keen to see the world-
renowned Harefield Heart
and Lung Hospital remain
welcomed the news. Jean
Brett, who chairs the Heart
of Harefield campaign, said
the Paddington Basin Project
was “a load of rubbish from
day one”.
Imperial takes role in Basic Instinct 2
The main entrance and walkway on the South Kensington campus were used to film scenes from the new movie Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction last
weekend (see pictures below). The mechanical engineering building was transformed into the ‘Wallace Medical Centre’. The film – which stars Sharon
Stone, David Morrissey, Charlotte Rampling, David Thewlis and former footballer Stan Collymore – is due for release next year
