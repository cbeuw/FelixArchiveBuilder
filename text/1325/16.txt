House of Wax is the first of this
summer’s big budget horror offer-
ings and is a return to the ‘teen
slasher’ genre that saturated our
screens in the late nineties.
The plot: a group of students ven-
ture unwisely into the woods, trying
to get to a football game, where they
discover a creepy little town whose
residents are either encased in wax
or members of the murderous fam-
ily that has killed everyone else.
Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) and
her boyfriend Wade head up the
group, which includes three other
friends and Carly’s trouble-making
twin brother Nick (Chad Michael
Murray). The gang of friends spend
an largely uneventful night camp-
ing out in the woods. The tensions
between Carly and Nick take cen-
tre-stage as their sibling rivalry
surfaces; as does Nick’s dislike of
Wade.
It is only the next afternoon that
things really take a turn for the
worse for the friends, when they
discover the town’s star tourist
attraction – Trudy’s House of Wax.
Unsurprisingly, what follows is lots
of screaming, running and excess
gore.
First and foremost, this is a horror
movie. It follows a tried and trusted
horror movie formula which, whilst
well known, usually does deliver
satisfactory thrills and chills. As
always, someone has to survive and
most people have to die. It is still a
myth as to why most act with abso-
lutely no common sense at all. No,
don’t go into the creepy museum all
by yourself. No, don’t go wandering
around the dangerous woods alone.
The main differences here are the
central premise of using wax to
encase live bodies (it’s more than a
little disturbing), as well as the fact
that the main protagonists are twin
brother and sister rather than some
loved-up teen couple. The film also
misses out the mandatory opening
scene massacre, instead fleshing
out the history of the killers and the
beginnings of the wax obsession.
House of Wax starts slowly, but
it builds up a good atmosphere of
impending doom, and a couple of
isolated incidents give a taste of
what is to come. When the blood
starts flowing, it does so in increas-
ingly shocking and spectacular
ways. There are some memorable
scenes, which is not so bad consid-
ering that this is a horror movie.
Some of the gorgeous young
Hollywood starlets do well enough
to pull off their obligatory kicking
and screaming roles. Cuthbert
comes across quite well as the
heroine, and Chad Michael Murray
is impressive as a sullen troubled
guy who loses all selfishness and
turns all hero-like as he tries to save
his twin sister. The supporting cast
is adequate, with Jared Padalecki
standing out the most as hapless
but eager Wade.
This brings me to Paris Hilton’s
acting debut as Paige. While it is
true that she is not a great actress
and her delivery is fairly two-dimen-
sional, she still manages an aver-
age performance even though her
character has to spend time being
chased around in her underwear.
One of the highlights of this film is
the awesome soundtrack, which fea-
tures great tracks from the Prodigy,
Marilyn Manson and Deftones.
Another is the theatrical ending,
which is big and bloody and well
worth waiting for.
I did like this film, which is based
on the 1953 film of the same title, as
it has all the ingredients needed for
the classic horror movie. This also
makes it a little bit predictable in
parts, but the unexpected goriness
more that makes up for this. So
House of Wax is an easy horror film
filled with lots of Hollywood babes,
psychotic killers and more wax than
you’ve ever seen before or are likely
to ever see again. M K Osakonor

Good Jolie fun
The Hollywood buzz over this film
has started. Originally troubled
with casting problems, after Nicole
Kidman pulled out and Brad Pitt
almost left the project as he could
only see himself working with
Angelina Jolie or Catherine Zeta
Jones, Mr & Mrs Smith should now
flourish.
Mr & Mrs Smith promises to be
a comedy-thriller, starring Pitt and
Jolie as John and Jane Smith – an
ordinary suburban couple with an
ordinary,lifelesssuburbanmarriage.
But each of them has a secret: they
are legendary assassins working for
competing organisations. When the
truth comes out, John and Jane end
up in each other’s cross-hairs as
they are hired to kill each other.
If you think it sounds familiar,
that’s because it probably is – I
can’t help but remember the James
Cameron movie True Lies with
Arnold Schwartzenegger and Jamie
Lee Curtis. Arnold played a spy but
lied about his job to his wife, played
by Jamie.
Can someone in Hollywood have a
semi-original thought please? They
keep trying to recycle the same old
ideas because they worked in the
past. Most recent remakes have
been terrible but I guess what’s
essentially different about this is
that both husband and wife are keep-
ing secrets in this film as opposed to
just the husband – what a ground-
breaking concept.
I’m being a little unfair – yes, the
story isn’t that original, but the trail-
er for the film shows potential. It
promises to be full of action but also
includes funny moments in which
the pair almost destroy their house
whilst attempting to kill each other.
Perhaps some marriage counselling
maybe needed.
Pitt and Jolie have an amazing
chemistry on screen. Don’t forget
this is the film that reportedly caused
the rift in Brad and Jen’s marriage
– it maybe worth checking out just
to see if the Hollywood rumour mill
was right or not. Although that’s not
why I’m looking forward to it.
It does boast an A list cast. Even if
you don’t like Pitt or Jolie, they are
fairly reasonable actors and are also
joined by Adam Brody, also known
as Seth from The OC.
Mr & Mrs Smith just seems like
one of those movies that, no matter
how unbelievable or stupid it may
get, it will still be entertaining and
great way to pass your time without
having to think too much. It looks
sexy, funny and action packed.
