NUS shenanigans
Yesterday I had the pleasure of
sitting through a meeting of the
Presidents of the Aldwych Group
(the students’ unions of the Russell
Group of 19 leading research univer-
sities). One of the more contentious
points of discussion was an update
from Cardiff University on the situ-
ation of higher education funding
in Wales – which actually required
the NUS Vice President (Education)
to have to walk out as she wasn’t
allowed to hear criticism of NUS
staff.
To cut a long story short, Cardiff
were upset that the NUS Wales
President and his staff had been
lobbying members of the Welsh
Assembly to vote in favour of intro-
ducing top-up fees in Wales. This was
against NUS Wales policy but was in
line with the NUS Wales’ political
affiliations (he is a Labour activist).
Whilst it’s not for me to comment
on what policy NUS Wales should
or shouldn’t have on tuition fees in
Wales, I always despair when I hear
of student politicians putting their
party political allegiances before
their students. For me it underlines
just how lucky we are not to be affili-
ated to the NUS and all the political
shenanigans that go with it.
Cycling safety
More eagle-eyed visitors to Beit
Quad this last week will have noticed
that the Imperial Standard has been
flying at half mast for the last few
days. This was in respect to Apijak
Srivannavit, a student who was
killed cycling on Cromwell Road.
This follows the death in March of a
much-loved ICT staff member, again
cycling on the Cromwell Road. There
have also been several reports in
this paper of cyclists being injured.
Union officers have for some time
been worried about the safety of
Cromwell Road, which is part of the
A4. Having driven in to London along
that road many times (usually from
Silwood Park) I can understand it
from a driver’s point of view. You
come in, from the M4, and it’s men-
tally difficult to get out of the ‘speed
way’ mind set, especially when you
want to get home quickly. But that’s
not a good reason to compromise
pedestrian safety.
We have tried to promote cycling
proficiency courses before – and
were offering some for free with
Kensington & Chelsea Council.
However, the onus isn’t just on
cyclists to cycle safely. Transport for
London must now take appropriate
measures (traffic calming, dedicat-
ed lanes, etc) to make the A4 safer
for motorists, cyclists and pedestri-
ans alike. How many more fatalities
does it need for the bureaucrats
in the Mayor’s office to sit up and
listen?
South Kensington sports
facilities
As many of you are aware, Imperial
will have a dearth of sports facilities
at the South Kensington campus
once Southside closes at the end of
June. The new £18m sports centre is
unlikely to be fully operational until
January. That will mean increased
pressure on other large hall spaces
around College for indoor sports.
We did look at relocating the fit-
ness gym to the Union gym but that
would have encroached on the only
remaining gymnasium on campus.
With Linstead hall residents having
evening meals in Sherfield, things
will be pretty tight.
Ultimately things will be much
better when the new sports centre
does open. The new swimming pool
and fitness gym will be free to all
students and staff as the College’s
Director of Communications
announced in his letter last week.
There will be increased charges for
clubs and societies to use the sports
hall space, but this will be much
less than the cost to the College of
providing the free fitness gym and
swimming pool. Overall the College
will be spending more on students
but the Union will have some diffi-
cult choices to make with respect to
our large provision of indoor sports
clubs.
Elections reminder
Finally, don’t forget. We have posi-
tions open for election, including the
new Deputy President (Graduate
Students). Find out how to stand for
election by visiting www.union.ic.ac.

STATE OF
THE UNION
MUSTAFA ARIF
UNION PRESIDENT
Five things you didn’t know about
the Summer Ball
1. This year the Union has secured
over £30,000 to be spent on the
Summer Ball. That’s a massive 10
times more than last year.
2. Every single penny from the ticket
you buy goes back into the Summer
Ball to make it bigger and better for
you!
3. If you buy your ticket earlier rather
than later, this gives us more time to
arrange Summer Ball ‘extras’ such
as a chocolate fountain, wandering
magicians and ‘Hollywood
look-alikes’.
4. Every year most people leave it until
the last few days before they buy their
ticket for the Summer Ball.
5. So don’t leave buying your ticket
until the last moment – go and buy it
now so we can make the Summer Ball
even more amazing than it’s already
going to be.
The joy of... plagiarism
There has been a lot of comment in
this newspaper lately (front page,
Felix 1323) regarding the topic of
plagiarism. This has been echo-
ing around the heady chambers of
College’s Senate and its sub-com-
mittees (on which I sit), and various
Union committees in the last few
weeks.
The College takes a very dim
view of plagiarism, the act of taking
without referencing from someone
else’s writing or speech. If caught,
students can face anything from
having to redo the piece of work
to being forbidden from ever sit-
ting any exams in the University of
London, depending on the severity
of the case.
Some students have expressed
concern that they’re not sure
exactly what constitutes plagia-
rism. Directors of Studies are
always keen to talk about the issue
in their introductory speeches,
and all students are given a copy
of the booklet Learning to Learn,
which is also hidden deep inside
the College website: www.ic.ac.uk/
e d u c a t i o n a l d e v e l o p m e n t / e -
learning/learningtolearn.htm.
Regarding the incidents in the
Department of Chemistry, student
representatives approached me,
worried that the department might
have acted heavy-handedly in the
timing of its ‘clampdown’ in which
they urged students to come for-
ward if they wanted to confess to
any instances of plagiarism. I took
this up with Professor Tom Welton,
the Director of Studies, and I was
satisfied that, in the situation, the
department acted reasonably. In this
case, it did seem quite widespread,
and about a dozen people came for-
ward having committed plagiarism
of some degree or other.
Many people have asked what
the College is doing about it. Some
students feel that the onus is on
lecturers to develop imaginative
ways of preventing or discouraging
plagiarism in the setting of their
coursework. For instance, I know
of one piece of coursework that has
unique data which depends on the
student’s College ID number. Yes,
it will involve more work to think
up new coursework, such that it’s
no longer possible to simply utilise
the networks of students who are
the guardians of coursework sub-
missions dating back to before you
were born, but the academic com-
munity must face facts and accept
that prevention is better than rem-
edy. Markers have at their disposal
high-tech software, capable of com-
paring essays to work that’s avail-
able online or has been submitted
in the past.
Students are obviously under a
lot of pressure (from families, spon-
sors, peers, lecturers and them-
selves) to succeed in their stud-
ies, and some go to any lengths to
do so. Obviously, no-one ever said
that degrees from Imperial grow
on trees, and College figures such
as the Pro-Rector (Educational
Quality) are keen to point out that
workload has not increased over the
years and that it is reasonable to
expect what we do expect from our
students.
The financial pressure on
students today is such that
many have to undertake part-time
employment on top of their stud-
ies and any Union activities in
which they may be involved. I have
heard reports from students hav-
ing to work as much as 20 hours
a week to fund their studies. I
suppose this is an appropriate
point to mention the College’s
Student Support Officer (student.
support@ic.ac.uk) who administers
the Hardship Fund. The Union’s
Information and Advice Centre
(advice@ic.ac.uk) is also able to
offer advice on financial and employ-
ment issues.
The bottom line is, in some depart-
ments, plagiarism has become a
‘social crime’ that has been normal-
ised, and it’s necessary to challenge
this attitude before the College can
move on.
