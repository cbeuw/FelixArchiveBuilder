A glorious hundred from
Almaher Shelly and a fan-
tastic performance with bat
and ball from Vaibhav Kumar
helped Imperial seconds
annihilate Royal Holloway by
159 runs in the final league
game of the ULU Cup.
The weather was per-
fect for a game of cricket,
and Imperial elected to bat
first on a nice firm wicket
at Harlington. Vaibhav and
Karthik opened the batting
for Imperial and got off to
a good solid start. Vaibhav
continued his season of good
form, driving beautifully in
the arc between cover and
mid-off and dispatching any-
thing fractionally short.
Karthik fell leg before
to Chris Plummer, which
brought Pete Munro to the
crease. Vabs and Pete put on
a good partnership, which
was marked by aggressive
running between the wick-
ets. Aussie Pete was in good
touch and looking good for a
big total when he fell with the
score on 87, bringing Almaher
to the wicket.
The platform had been set
and Imperial were on course
for a score of around 200.
Little did Royal Holloway
know what they were in for!
Al began beautifully, punch-
ing off the back foot for four
and within no time was on 25
with four boundaries stroked
along the ground. Then the
carnage began.
In the afternoon heat, Al’s
innings brought a downpour
of sixes. His first one was
probably the biggest of the
lot, deposited miles away
into the vast empty spaces
outside the ground. The arc
between mid-on and mid-
wicket received maximum
attention as the fielding side
were left gasping for breath.
Anything full disappeared;
anything short was pum-
melled. It was anything but
slogging, just batting at its
brilliant best. It was breath-
taking to watch for the sheer
quality of the strokeplay and
the frantic pace at which the
runs were scored.
Al rocketed from 50 to 82 in
the space of just nine balls,
with one particular over going
for 26 runs. In the midst of
this mayhem Vab, who played
his role to perfection in the
partnership, compiled a very
good half century before
being finally dismissed for 53.
Jibran and Jacob perished
in the quest for quick runs.
Suraj began well with two
consecutive boundaries and
offered good support to Al,
running hard between the
wickets and ensuring Al got
most of the strike.
Al was on 97 not out, and
expectation was high all
around the ground. Everyone
knew the hundred was just
a matter of time away. The
only doubt was whether
it was going to be a six or
a four to take him to it. Al
hit the ball straight past the
bowler for four and there
were huge cheers from team
mates watching and genuine
applause from the Holloway
fielders.
It was one of the finest 100s
Harlington had seen, and was
scored in just 37 deliveries!
The dominating fashion in
which he batted was amazing
to watch. Al continued in his
quest for runs and was finally
dismissed in the 37th over for
120. During Al’s stay at the
crease a whopping 150 runs
were scored in 15 overs at 10
runs an over. Avi hit the final
ball for 4 and Imperial ended
with a gigantic score of 270
for six in 40 overs.
By the time Holloway had
their turn to bat, they were
mentally exhausted. Anand
got the first wicket with Jacob
taking the catch at gully.
Jibran’s accurate late swing-
ing deliveries once again
proved more than just a chal-
lenge for the batsmen who
had no clue whatsoever. Luck,
however, wasn’t on Jibran’s
side as the slip cordon spilt
several half chances.
Imperial continued to attack
with three slips and a gully
and Holloway struggled to
keep up with the required run
rate. They then moved along
to 61 for one in 17 overs with
their batsmen hardly scoring
anything off the face of the
bat before Avi struck, getting
through the defences of their
opening batsman.
Ali Najefi picked up a cou-
ple of quick wickets with
deliveries that swung in late
to leave Holloway reeling at
79 for four. It only got worse
for the visitors from there on.
Vabs came on to bowl and one
batsman followed another
back to the pavilion as they
choked against the swinging
ball accompanied by clever
changes of pace.
With his third and fourth
wickets off consecutive deliv-
eries, Vabs was on a hat-trick
but Holloway survived it. The
final wicket fell when the ball
fittingly went straight into
the hands of Al at short mid-
wicket, to give Vabs a richly
deserved five wicket haul.
As a result of their tremen-
dous win, Imperial seconds
topped their league and are
now just one game away from
the final.
Imperial seconds have gone
from strength to strength, a
closely-knit team playing for
each other and looking to go
the entire distance in this
tournament. The team would
like to thank Robert Fitch for
volunteering to score during
the games and really appreci-
ate the support.
CRICKET
ing deliveries once again ate the support.
