It has been a long time since I read
a book that insists on intruding so
often into my life, rudely barging
into otherwise sensible conversa-
tion and forcing me to evangelise
on its behalf. I find myself name-
dropping David Mitchell’s third
novel with promiscuous abandon,
banging on to complete strangers
like a belligerent drunk that they
must, simply must read this book,
only to be flummoxed when they
demand a description of said gen-
ius work. How does one begin to
describe a book that so transcends
the constraints of style and genre?
Cloud Atlas follows Mitchell’s
highly praised Ghostwritten and
number9dream, and was the win-
ner of Richard and Judy’s Read
of the Year 2005. But don’t let that
put you off. Cloud Atlas, apart from
having some of the most beauti-
ful cover art ever to grace a dust
jacket, is a work of breathtaking
imagination and virtuosity.
It is perhaps best described as
six mini-novels in one, each set in
different eras and countries, and
written in widely differing styles.
We begin with the seafaring jour-
nal of Adam Ewing, a 19th century
American reflecting on the nature
of colonialism as he waits on the
Chatham Islands off New Zealand
for his ship to sail. But just as
we become absorbed in Adam’s
story, we are uprooted, mid-sen-
tence, and whisked forward in time
to 1930s Brussels. Here we meet
disgraced music student Robert
Frobisher, and through his acerbic
and caustically witty letters follow
his attempts to ingratiate himself
with his hero – the ageing, cantan-
kerous composer Vyvyan Ayrs.
The pattern continues, as
Mitchell takes us on a whirlwind
journey across continents and cen-
turies, via detective story, mem-
oir and sci-fi fantasy, and sets us
down in a post-apocalyptic future
for a fireside storytelling session.
But although chronologically the
end, this is in fact only the mid-
dle of the book – like a Russian
doll taken apart and then reas-
sembled, Mitchell proceeds to take
us back through time, complet-
ing each narrative where he left
off, until we find ourselves again
sailing the ocean waves with Mr
Ewing. This may sound tricksy, but
the book is so much more than the
sum of its parts – each narrative is
cleverly linked to its predecessor,
and as each one is concluded, our
knowledge from the future serves
to invest the interlocking stories
with a significance and an emo-
tional power that would otherwise
have been absent.
Mitchell’s intention is to expose
the will to power that unites man-
kind across ages, and the univer-
sality of atrocities committed by
man against man in the pursuit
of dominance and possession. His
ambition is a bold one, but one that
is effective in demonstrating that
although each person’s life may
appear insignificant in the grand
scheme of things, ultimately we all
have the potential to make a differ-
ence to our present and future.
If this all seems a little too new-
age for serious Imperial tastes,
Mitchell never comes across as
heavy-handed or sanctimonious.
The novel manages to deliver
moments of poignancy, suspense
and hilarity – the memoir of can-
tankerous present-day publisher
Timothy Cavendish, which chroni-
cles his unwilling incarceration in
a nursing home populated by the
‘shuffling undead’ and his attempts
to escape his captors, made me
laugh out loud. Elsewhere the
futuristic tale of Somni, a cloned
fabricant enslaved in a fast food
restaurant, is both a chilling reflec-
tion on the extreme consequences
of consumerism and a biting sat-
ire on present-day McDonalds cul-
ture.
Cloud Atlas has been criticised
by a few who found it confusing,
pretentious or just plain unread-
able. While such an original work
is sure to have its detractors, to
dismiss it on the basis of its subver-
sion of literary conventions is to
tragically miss out. The sixth tale,
recounted in a devastated future
that has reverted to medieval feu-
dalism, employs an invented dialect
peppered with words like ‘yibber’,
‘magicky’ and ‘knucklin’. Initially,
it is hard going and might seem
an experiment in creative writing
gone too far, but persevere and it
becomes poetic and absorbing.
The novel’s structure can also
be frustrating and emotionally
demanding. This is a sprawling
banquet of a book, employing an
army of characters and necessitat-
ing much cross-referencing as the
web of disparate narratives grows
more extensive, complex and inter-
linked. Each narrative continues
for just long enough to draw you in,
before stopping abruptly at a piv-
otal moment and being replaced by
another whose imposition you tem-
porarily resent. However, it is not
long before Mitchell’s consummate
skill and control over his material
acts to immerse you all over again.
Mitchell playfully anticipates
his critics through the voice of
Robert Frobisher, whose composi-
tion for six overlapping soloists,
Cloud Atlas Sextet, has a structure
that mirrors the novel’s own. He
muses on the public reception of
his masterpiece: “Revolutionary or
gimmicky? Shan’t know until it’s
finished.” The novel is ultimately
both, but if you are prepared to
discard the standard conventions
of storytelling you will discover a
work of astounding originality that
will not disappoint.
After a term dominated by the
horrors of revision, what better
way to escape the tyranny of exams
than by embarking upon a liter-
ary voyage across continents and
centuries? Cloud Atlas is not lit-
erary fast food, but a novel to be
savoured, to linger over, and – like
any truly great meal – share with
your friends. Oh, there I go again.
Look, for the sake of my social life
and my friends’ sanity, just read
this book. Please.

Pacha gets dirty
No, ‘Posha’ hasn’t lost its chic. And the crowd haven’t turned into munters. We’re talking about
the music, courtesy of Circo Loco

Those of you who have heard of
DC10 and Circo Loco are proba-
bly few and far between, but when
their showcase comes to London,
it’s guaranteed to be an amazing
night.
DC10 is a clubbers’ club hidden
away on the barrens of Ibiza. Under
the flight path of planes to and from
the island, it hosts many of the big-
gest names on the white isle. The
beauty of the club is the fact that it
is open during the day and so the
normal scally beer boys that people
usually associate with Ibiza either
don’t know about it or don’t know
how to get there!
Circo Loco houses the best
music on the island. The terrace’s
speakers blast out melodic deep
house beats and funky rhythms
while inside has a unique blend of
dirty bass and acid like sounds. You
will not hear the majority of the
choons anywhere else – the club
prides itself on being underground
and individual.
Line-ups announced usually only
include the residents, but many big
name DJs turn up with their record
bags and get involved on the decks
free of charge and unannounced.
This adds to the atmosphere, which
is already raising the roof and ooz-
ing out of the fire exits.
This is what they tried to emulate
in London, at Pacha. I had my doubts
when I heard about it. Having a dirty
underground clubbing experience
hosted in the expensive interior of
one of London’s ‘poshest’ clubs just
didn’t sound right. Fortunately, I was
wrong.
The lights had all been turned
off and the bass was cranked up
to ear bleeding, heart shuddering
levels (the way it always should be).
The star act of the night was the
gorgeous Jo Mills, and she did not
disappoint, spewing out filthy house
with hard deep bass lines – music
so dirty that it disgusted many of
the usual visitors to the club. These
were no doubt looking forward
to the usual happy, smiley funky
house that Pacha usually plays.
Glancing across the dance floor I
could see the real clubbers, stand-
ing with there eyes closed, imag-
ining being back in Ibiza, soaked
in sweat and surrounded by gay
German body builders with their
tops off (well maybe not the last bit
but those of you that have been to
DC10 will know exactly what I’m
talking about).
The sounds cannot be described
by any one genre – the techno-esque
bass lines were as hard as nails but
as slow as house, yet Mills’ choppy,
messy mixing provided an amazing
breakbeat element that never failed
to take my breath away.
