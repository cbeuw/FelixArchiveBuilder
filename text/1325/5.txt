My uncle, the global warming sceptic
An Imperial alumnus and the first elected president of the students’ union, Piers Corbyn is among the
world’s leading global warming sceptics. Zoë Corbyn talked to her uncle about his views
Piers Corbyn, Imperial
College educated astrophysi-
cist and students’ union pres-
ident 1969-1970, makes tea in
the basement of Delta House
on Borough High Street.
The kitchen smells of paint
and drains. Fred Millson
phones about housing strug-
gles. The tea stews. Piers is
57 years old, tall, lean, pale
and mildly unkempt. He has
greying curls and glasses that
he rarely removes. Today he
wears a bright blue shirt.
He wants a copy of the lat-
est New Scientist. It contains
something quite important
– a discussion of the sceptics’
position, an exposé on the
‘hockey stick’ graph that pur-
ports to show temperatures
higher than they have been
for 1000 years. The graph is
a symbol of what has occu-
pied Piers’ mind for a very
long time and will continue
to occupy it certainly for the
next five hours.
Since 1990, Piers’ company,
Weather Action, has been
forecasting extreme weather
events months and years in
advance. The forecasts aren’t
always right, but their success
rate is impressive. The meth-
od is lodged in two places – in
Piers’ head and in a secret
safety deposit box. The busi-
ness has grown and shrunk,
gone through dot.com rises
and dot.com crashes and
stock exchange listings and
delistings, and will likely do
so again. But for the moment
it’s in a period of “right siz-
ing”, hence the recent move
to Delta House.
Weather Action’s hub is
number 19d – through triple
doors on the third floor land-
ing. But 19d can’t hold eve-
rything. So the photocopier
languishes outside the door,
backed against a banner of
solar corona. Weather Action
files fill the shelves that fill
the corridor that disappears
to the communal courtyard.
The walls are pin-drop thin.
But Piers does more than
run Weather Action from 19d.
He is also a leading climate
sceptic, as confirmed by the
Russian government.
For Piers, our carbon diox-
ide pollution is not changing
world temperatures in any
significant way. Not making
a blind bit of difference. Any
increaseintemperaturebeing
experienced is an entirely
natural phenomenon.
Piers’ theory is that the real
climate culprits are particles
from the sun – the ones mak-
ing up the solar wind and
streaming earthwards to
create lovely auroras at the
north and south poles. They
interact with the earth’s mag-
netic field, driving the world’s
weather patterns and alter-
ing the global temperature.
Partly delayed and over long
time scales, world tempera-
ture then largely controls
carbon dioxide levels. Any
enhancing effects from our
greenhouse gas pollution are
small and second order. His
data is based on a unique
reworking of standard figures
and published papers.
It means, for Piers, that
carbon dioxide centred
global warming theory is
quasi-mystical – more sug-
gestive of divine interven-
tion or climate-homeopathy.
Dangers of human-induced
climate change are alarmist
nonsense; the Kyoto proto-
col political absurdity. He’s
annoyed about how dishon-
est the other side is, that the
global warming scientists will
not engage in public debate.
Instead they put environmen-
tal freaks up, who won’t dis-
cuss the science and bandy
about figures for the numbers
of scientists that agree with
them. Yada, yada, yada.
Piers and his mug of tea
glide to the right of the pho-
tocopier and into room 19d.
He manoeuvres into his
desk. It forms an ‘L
’ shape
with the desk of his research
assistant, Judy Humphrey.
Coloured files and empty
peanut butter jars protrude
from the shelves that coat the
walls. The room is like the
final stages of a Tetris game
– there is no space left.
He considers the day
ahead. There’s a farmer who
wants a monthly forecast,
the liquidation of Weather
Action Limited to be final-
ised before the vampires bite,
emails from the climate scep-
tics website to sort through
and the paper to Geophysical
Research Letters.
Judy arrives, but without
the New Scientist. She has
pretty, sprite-like features and
is a recent planetary science
graduate. She removes her
chunky footwear and boots up
her iMac. Piers can’t pay her,
but the interesting nature of
the work seems to partially
compensate while she looks
for a PhD position. She met
Piers through her dad.
Piers and Judy eat humous
and cheese and tomato
sandwiches. The computers
add to the terrible heat of
the room. They make jokes
about greenhouses and open
the windows. Judy asks about
progress on the paper.
“I’ve sent a summary,”
replies Piers.
Something weird happens
to the correlation between
world temperatures and
solar particle effects in 1995.
There’s a divergence. World
temperature goes one way
and geomagnetic activity
goes another. But Piers and
Judy have a theory. It was
announced at the Institute of
Physics lecture on 2 February.
It’s a transpolar shift proc-
ess. There’s currently a rapid
motion of the magnetic north
pole towards the geographic
north pole, producing extra
warming. A movement away
would give extra cooling. In
the next five to ten years they
think warming is likely to be
maintained as a transpolar
shift occurs. This will be fol-
lowed by the magnetic pole
moving away from the geo-
graphic pole, and consider-
able world cooling by 2040.
Nils-Axel Morner recom-
mended they try Geophysical
Research Letters. He is a
Stockholm University profes-
sor who Piers saw last at the
sceptics’ conference on the 27
January. Nils-Axel’s particu-
lar beef is the wildly exagger-
ated claims about sea level
rises.
“Did they have a positive
response?” quizzes Judy.
“Well, the woman who
wrote back said, ‘I’m not a
scientist, just send it in’ sort
of thing. But I think it will get
published. Well the Russians
have asked for it anyway. I’ve
got an email from Andrei
Illarionov asking for it.”
Andrei Illarionov is Russian
president Vladimir Putin’s
economic advisor.
Piers likes talking about
the Russians. At Andrei’s
invitation, he went to a con-
ference in Moscow on the 7
and 8th July 2004. The “global
warming dogmatists” were
pressuring the Russians to
sign Kyoto. They – Sir John
Houghton and Sir David King,
representing the British sci-
entific establishment – talked
them into holding the con-
ference to kindly lecture the
Russians on the ills of carbon
dioxide.
It was an imperialist
approach, says Piers. But
Andrei Illarionov recognised
it and saw an opportunity to
turn things on their head. He
invited seven leading scep-
tics from around the world
– including Piers – but kept
it quiet. A few days before
the conference, Sir David
got wind and phoned up to
say that if the sceptics were
there, the British contingent
wouldn’t be coming. Illarionov
responded with words to
the effect: “Very well, please
yourself Sir David”.
In the end, the British came
anyway, but Sir David walked
out soon after his speech
saying he had no time and
had to see a minister. Andrei
Illarionov stood up and said
this behaviour was totally
unacceptable. Piers got so
wrapped up in the trip that
he missed the return flight
to London and had to wait 17
hours in Moscow airport.
The Russians eventually did
sign Kyoto, but Piers thinks
they were just trying to out-
play Europe.
Judy enters data from a
book of astronomical tables.
Piers examines today’s
emails from the climate scep-
tics’ network. He’s sure “the
enemy” has planted spies. To
circumvent them, he occa-
sionally only responds to
known people.
“I don’t know why you are
referring to them as the
enemy, we are not waging
war quite,” says Judy.
For Piers, the real difficulty
with being a sceptic is that
the opposition immediately
assumesheiswrong,ignorant
and, most commonly, funded
by oil companies. They are
big insults. But he would take
the funding if he could get it.
Though he would, of course,
also ask for matched funding
from the IPCC.
At a recent meeting, some-
one enquired whether the
oil companies were buying
Weather Action forecasts.
Piers replied that the largest
buyers were in fact farmers.
But the questioner wouldn’t
believe him and instead
described Mr Corbyn as being
“dangerous”.
It’s these sort of remarks
that lead Piers to provocative
comparisons, which he rec-
ognises are rather over the
top. He likens the campaign
against the sceptics to that
by the church against Galileo,
the global warmers to Hitler’s
research scientists. To his
delight, Piers was recently
quoted in a magazine article
as an example of a sceptic
who definitely shouldn’t be
quoted.
But he has no doubt that
people are being sacked and
losing funding for not believ-
ing in global warming, and
research scientists in Europe
– where the global warming
lobby is centred – are doing
very nicely indeed thank you.
For Piers, it’s not just the
science. The ramifications of
the global warmers’ doctrine
worry him equally. He’s deep-
ly concerned by the potential
for nuclear power and the
potential for preventing third
world development that the
doctrine breeds. The hidden
agenda, as Piers sees it, is to
get high technology European
industries at the top and keep
them there – the developing
world beholden to expensive
carbon dioxide minimisation
technology.
But it’s irrelevant now, and
the paper and the Russians
and New Scientist will have to
wait. He’s off to the account-
ant now before closing time
to deal with the liquidation
of Limited so
the vultures can be put to bed
and the company can breathe
financially. He finishes sort-
ing out the farmer and smart-
ens up with a tie.
“Our carbon dioxide
pollution is not chang-
ing world temperatures
in any significant way.
It’s not making a blind
bit of difference”
“Piers’ theory is that
the real climate
culprits are particles
from the sun”
“He likens the
campaign against the
sceptics to that by the
church against Galileo”
Corbyn suggests changes in the Earth’s temperature are due to solar particles
interacting with the Earth’s magnetic field
