NHS Reforms
particularly true in the area of systems
which provide management with
information on resources, costs and the
progress of contracts. Why else are
hospitals quoting such a wide range of
prices for the same procedure? (Even a
simple 'bed day' in a London hospital can
cost anything between SI80 and £250.)
The NHS is waking up to the fact that it
needs accurate, timely information on all
its activities, to be able to manage itself
successfully whether the reforms endure
beyond the life of this government or are
abandoned as rapidly as they were
introduced. The NHS is finally waking up
to the fact that it needs information
systems and information technology of
the kind that have been used in industry
and the commercial sector for years.
Sadly, its plunge into IT is in many cases
causing as many problems in the new
system as all the other factors.
The NHS is an immature market as far
as IT is concerned. 'Mature' industries put
up to 20% of their expenditure into IT.
The NHS spends less than half a percent
of its expenditure (around £200 million
per year, expected to grow to around
£500 million per year over the next five
years). It lacks expertise in specifying,
purchasing, installing, operating and
managing information systems. It has
insufficient and inexperienced staff and
has been slow to recruit or train. One of
the most damning reports on the NHS
produced by the National Audit Office,
"Managing computer projects in the
National Health Service", concluded that
"management of computer projects was
often weak, with many failures to follow
good practice, resulting in poor value for
money".
In addition, some system suppliers have
seen the chance to turn a quick buck and
are fleecing the NHS with inflated prices
and unsuitable systems. Where the NHS
develops its own systems, these often
overrun on cost and price, are poorly
designed and still fail to meet the needs
of the users. The systems already in place
are fragmented and run on a bewildering
array of hardware and software. Jo
Bayes, a department of health research
student, put it succinctly when she said,
"you name it, we've got it. Not only that,
we have all the previous marks, models
and versions, and those are just the ones
we know about!"
The NHS also lacks any clear strategy
on information and information systems.
It is disturbing that, five years after the
resource management initiative was
launched, the deputy director of the NHS
Management Executive's information
systems directorate, Ray Rogers, could
call his workshop session at the annual
Healthcare Computing conference "FIRST
thoughts on an information strategy for
the NHS".
• Nowhere is the folly of such haste and
inexperience shown more clearly than in
the area of GP fundholding. GP practices
which wished to become fundholders had
to have more than 9000 patients on their
list and to already be sophisticated
computer users. Such experienced and
enthusiastic users would be expected to
have little problem with the systems
designed to manage the fundholding
aspects of the practice (essentially
accounting and tracking patients). This is
not the case.
The first problem lies in the
specification of the system. This was
drawn up by the Department of Health
and sent to the system developers.
Systems were then tested by consultants
Touche Ross for 'conformance' to the
specification. Unfortunately, the designers
of the specification clearly had no idea
how a real GP practice worked, what
information was required or would be
available at which stage of the treatment.
For instance, the system asks for a
The Audit Cube
The audit cube
identifies the issues
involved in a nursing
audit, sets them in the
context of the whole
NHS, and provides a
guide against which
audit progress can be
measured.

diagnosis from the GP before the patient
is sent to the hospital or outpatient clinic.
This allows a sum of money to be
earmarked from the GPs funds to pay for
that treatment. The doctor, however, is
usually sending the patient to the hospital
in order to obtain that precise diagnosis
and at the time of referral cannot provide
the answer demanded by the software.
Once the patient reaches the hospital,
accompanied by the vast amounts of data
which are required by the department of
health, the hospital usually throws most
of this information out of the window,
since it has no use for it. The 'unique
referral number' given to each patient by
the system is meaningless to the hospital
system, while the standard referral letter
contains no details of the contract
number, which is what the hospital is
interested in. As Angie Daniels, Oxford
regional primary care computing advisor,
said at a recent seminar on primary care
computing: "Nobody thought to share the
specification with the hospitals." Another
consequence is that necessary information
is not flowing back from the hospitals to
the fundholders.
Apart from these problems, some users
have discovered that passing the
conformance test did not guarantee that
their system would actually work on 1
April 1991. At least one system did not
and several of the others are very
unstable, particularly in their interaction
with other GP system such as patient
registers. This instability is undoubtedly
the result of the speed with which the
systems were developed (around six
months in most cases) and the
inadequacies of the specification, which
appears to have been aimed at
accountants rather than software
designers. There have also been
complaints of inadequate training and a
lack of basic accounting understanding by
system suppliers.
There are some good aspects to the
reforms. The NHS does need better
information that will allow both managers
and clinicians to make sound judgements
about patient care. But the way the
reforms have been implemented, the
speed, and the sacrifice of real needs to
political expediency will not help the NHS
face its future. Baroness Cumberledge, a
leading Conservative health policy
advisor, told a conference of health
service managers earlier this month that
the NHS was in danger. Its 'board of
directors' is Parliament, she explained,
and Parliament was dominated by the
"two-swords length that separates the
government and the opposition". The
NHS is being used to score political
points. It should be more important than
that: it is an important national resource
and it deserves better than to be kicked
about like a football between the children
at Westminster.
