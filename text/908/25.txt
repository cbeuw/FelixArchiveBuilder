iMSh/Chapterttouse Ride scene?
$||y Worn a journalistic point of
view to !<se Ride as the closest comparison.
Its purely an initial thing anyway. The new
stuff wi have been rehearsing is gonna
p N f g e that problem for us. In any case
there's not that much of a comparison there...
The whole scene is getting horribly cjidftey
at the moment. There's a thing With the
London and Thames Valley bands which has
got nothing to do with us, you know, its
getting really cliquey and they list each
others songs as their favourite songs...But
haying said that we have put BIUM0}
of our list of ten favourites in MM. It's great
because the knives are beginning to come out
and its getting far more interesting. They all
go to each others parties and each others
gigs. Just one big club. They shouldjbe
reported to the Monopolies Commission...**
It was obvious from tonight's gig, even to the
most cynical observer, that indeed Ride is a
lazy yardstick with which to pigeon-hole
Xatherine Wheel. Over the last few months,
throu.. at touring, the Wheelies have
reached a supremely focused and fluid sound,
far removed from any weak effogJUg

What were the
c i r c u m s t a n c e s
surrounding your first
record?
"It was produced
and recorded in our
bedroom...it was the1
demo's. They were
just so spontaneous,
they weren't really thought about, they were
really fresh things. The more we listened to
them the more they felt really real. It was
patently obvious that we wouldn't be able to
reproduce them if we tried to re- record them
and so we used the demo's. And we've done
exactly the same thing with the second
record." Is an album
forthcoming?
"We are very close
to signing a deal with
a label. As you know,
f
the" indie/major thing
is becoming
increasingly blurred
now..if there is such
thing as an indie ethic its the way you think.
Like doing what you want to do yourself, not
. being careerist about it but obviously wanting
to get on. Whether we sign to an indie or a
|Btjpr label won't hopefully matter to
people...It's the difference between

that the band possess. There's a working
atmosphere that surrounds them, no doubt
due to having a little more tune on the planet
than most of us pop kids. Ego hasn't got in
