FELIX
"v", the cult TV show, has been released
on video by Warner Bros. This huge
series covers no less than four videos,
one of which is over two and a half
hours long! This covers parts I & II where
spaceships arrive on Earth carrying
humanoids from another planet.
At first the aliens declare their
friendship for the populace and offer to
sell their highly advanced technology in
exchange for valuable minerals, but soon
their true nature reveals itself - they are
disguised carnivores, intent on stealing
the world's water supply and turning
humans into slaves and FOOD! One
cameraman, Mike Donovan, uncovers
their deadly secret and joins the
resistance movement to fight the sinister
oppression.
The other three videos form the Final
Battle. In part one, the Visitors herd
humans into camps for their 'protection'.
In an attempt to uncover their evil plot,
Donovan raids a media event and starts a
'V for Victory' rally call. But some
women are horrified to learn they are
now pregnant by the few kindly Visitors.
The battle continues when Mike's son is
taken hostage and Donovan has to
exchange himself to be tortured with
truth serum injections in order to learn
the identity of traitors aboard the
mothership.
To free the world from alien
domination, rebels extract bacteria from
an interplanetary off-spring, fatal to
Visitors but harmless to humans.
However, the invaders possess a device
that could destroy the world. The rebels
must disarm the bomb but the leader of
the Visitors, maniacal with fury over
reports of dying alien troopers, makes
one last attempt to ensure the Visitors'
master plan succeeds.
Felix has several sets of videos to
give away, courtesy of Warner Bros.
