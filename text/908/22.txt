SMIRNOFFSTUDENTFASHIO
Smirnoff Student Fashion Week 1991
was held at the Business Design Cen-
tre, Islington. Twelve fashion shows
were staged over four days each by
a different college. This gave the
degree and diploma students an op-
portunity to display their creativity
and skills not only to the public, but
also to prospective employers and
sponsors from the British fashion in-
dustry. A static exhibition area also
contained displays by various
students.
The Smirnoff Student
Fashion award was Held on
Wednesday. The theme, States
of Man, contained four different
' categories: Beginning, Resourc-
ing, Believing and Remembering.
Seventy semi-finalists took part in
the gala show when category winners
and an overall winner were chosen.
Seventeen countries throughout the
world also participated in the Smirnoff UK
Fashion Awards. The show was hosted by
Jeff Banks and televised by the BBC for the
Clothes Show.
