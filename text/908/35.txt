Here's a little brain teaser to keep you going for a
while. Above is a crossword with no clues.
If you haven't already guessed, each number
corresponds to a letter, so all you have to do is
find out which number represents which letter and
hay-presto, it's done in a twinkling of an eye.
What, it's not that easy you say. You're just lucky
we didn't get time to write our very own
Cubeword; a nine by nine by nine crossword to
really peel off any brain cells left after the exams!
Anyway, we've generously given you three of the
letter/number combinations to get you started, so
off you go.
