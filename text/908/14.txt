FELIX
Of Firecrackers,<
Well, one day it happens that I am sitting
in Ian Richard's chow joint, the
Caterpillar Cafe, partaking of a little chilli
and rice, which is a very refreshing dish
at this time of year, when I am suddenly
aware of a loud thud beside me.
Naturally, I am very much perturbed, as I
am not accustomed to hearing loud thuds
in Ian Richard's joint, and I am thinking
that Ian Richard's blood pressure may be
shooting up some, because the last time
he hears a loud thud in his joint it is the
inhabitants of the Iraqi Embassy trying
out a small shipment of firecrackers from
overseas, which is an event apt to cause
loud thuds around and about in general.
However, on looking round I discover
that the loud thud is on account of Shifty
Shan dropping into the chair next to me
as heavy as a South Kensington copper
busting up lock-in, which is very heavy,
indeed.
Now 1 am'extremely cautious, since it is
well known to one and all that Shifty
Shan is having some considerable dispute
with the authorities which seem to think
that he is owing them dough, and I do
not wish to associate with such a
character, especially as a guy may get
judged by the company he keeps.
Naturally though, I give him a big hello,
as he may think I am being inhospitable
if I suddenly take it on the lam out of
there, and may get sored up at me, and
there is no percentage in having such a
guy as Shifty Shan sored up at you, on
account of his being a greatly respected
citizen in the underworld. Shifty Shan
leans forward very close, and if Bookie
Butcher is persent at this moment, he will
give three-to-one to anybody who cares
to take it that that Shifty Shan very soon
soils up his nice shirtfront with my chilli,
but then Shifty Shan stops and speaks to
me as follows:
'You remember,' he says, 'that some
time ago Happy Steve has a most
intriguing notion for a Rag stunt?'
Now this guy which Shan mentions is
known to folks who are in on these
things, as Happy Steve because he is
always going about with such a dolorous
expression on his kisser that anyone
would think he just loses all his dough, or
his doll, though it is well understood that
he is pretty well up to the noggin with
potatoes, and no doll ever leaves him
that would sadden him so severely, what
with his being homely as a mud fence, or
maybe more so. I wish to state, though,
that I know of no party more honest than
Happy Steve, which is a fortunate thing
because he is also the head guy in the
Rag business, which is a dodge for
causing decent citizens to part with their
scratch by telling them that it is to be
given to sick children, and elephants, and
such; and any party who is willing to be
so free with the potatoes he collects in
this manner is a sure thing to have plenty
of integrity about him.
Anyway, I remember very clearly that
Happy Steve once comes up with a
notion which I will indeed say is
intriguing, although I will use a much
stronger word, which anybody who
knows me will be very much surprised to
hear me say, since I am generally
regarded as something of a soft pooch, at
that. I recall that he is good and scotched
up at the time, which is by no means an
unusual situation for him, and that all
other citizens within hearing are equally
well dosed with assorted beverages, if not
more so, and so I am willing to lay plenty
of six to five that no-one, not even Happy
Steve, remembers this notion the next
day.
Now Happy Steve's idea is to nip into
the Iraqi Embassy very quietly, like cats
on tiptoe, though anyone who sees
Happy Steve will protest very loudly that
he is about as much like a cat on tiptoe
as King Kong, and borrow the nameplate
from the door of His Excellency the
Ambassador without asking his
permission first. It seems that many guys
who associate with Happy Steve are in
the habit of borrowing signs and
nameplates and such things without
permission, and the gendarmes never get
the old wind of them.
Of course, I say to Shifty Shan that I
wish to have no truck with this scheme,
and in fact I want no part of it, because
maybe the gendarmes are getting wised
But now it appears that Shifty Shan
nonetheless has some of his faculties
about him on that occasion, and this
worries me no little. In fact, I am
beginning to wish most heartily that the
loud thud I hear is indeed a firecracker
from overseas, even if it makes Ian
Richard's blood pressure shoot up so high
it spouts out the top of his noggin,
because it will mean that the Iraqi
Embassy becomes nothing but a burnt-out
shell, and furthermore contains nothing of
any interest whasoever to parties with
such ideas as Happy Steve has at this
time.
up by this time, unless they have less
brains than a bullfrog. Furthermore, I say,
it may be that His Excellency the
Ambassador is sitting in his office when
we borrow his nameplate, and feels that
he wishes to keep it, and perhaps it
enters his mind to try out some more
firecrackers. But by this time Shifty Shan
is getting impatient, because it appears he
agrees to meet Happy Steve with enough
guys to carry out the heist, and Happy
Steve will be greatly distressed if there
are not enough guys, and when Happy
Steve is distressed you can bet a C-note
any day of the week that other parties
16
Madmen,
around him will feel his distress very
acutely. So before you can say Jack
Robinson, I find myself walking to the
Iraqi Embassy with Shifty Shan, and
Happy Steve, and a party by the name of
Penguin, whose square monicker is Marc
Ellis, and who is looking to get a slice of
Happy Steve's action if Happy Steve
should ever pop off unexpectedly, and
another party called Paul Reynish, who
has such a sweet and innocent puss that
you will not think he is in the habit of
flaunting the rules of polite society,
although when it comes to borrowing
property without the owner's permission,
he is just naturally a curly wolf. Also
along with us is Little Chas, who is
always seen in the same clothes except
when he is dressed up to go to some
knowledge of politics, but I notice that
one or two parties in the crowd are
rodded up under their suits, and I see
that one guy has a pineapple, which
some folks call a grenade, in his back
pocket, so I judge that they feel rather
strongly about things in general. I cannot
see that there is any percentage in trying
to enter the Iraqi Embassy at this time,
since the coppers guarding the joint are
all rodded up too, and there are a great
many of them, but Paul Reynish tells
them that we are flogging insurance, and
we are allowed inside, because it seems
that no-one desires to insure the Iraqi
Embassy, it being a proposition somewhat
hotter than a ton of coals, and they are
desperate for insurance in case the mob
wishes to break their windows, or
swank occasion, and who offends the
noses of many decent citizens in his time,
particularly since he is so little that he
never reaches higher than their noses, if
that.
When we reach the Iraqi Embassy, we
find a middling large mob outside with
very large banners, and these people are
yelling very loud, in language that is-'
most impolite, and it seems that what
they want is for the inhabitants of the
Iraqi Embassy to leave, because their
politics and their beliefs and suchlike are
disquieting the local population more than
somewhat. Personally, I have very little
something.
Shifty Shan remains outside, because,
he says, his position does not allow him
to engage in anything that is unlawful or
not allowed, although he wishes us every
success and furthermore, he says he sees
a friend in the mob, and wishes to chew
the fat with him. So we enter the joint
and make our way up the stairs towards
His Excellency the Ambassador's office,
explaining to one and all that we are
flogging insurance, though many parties
appear very surprised indeed to be told
that such a looking guy as Little Chas is
in this profession; on the other hand, it is

loudly agreed that Happy Steve has such
a kisser as you will never find on anyone
but an insurance dealer.
We find His Excellency the
Ambassador's office, and his nameplate is
no small slab such as is on the door of
Shifty Shan's room, because it has to
have His Excellency's full title on it,
which is His Excellency the Minister
Extraordinary and Ambassador
Plenipotentiary of such-and-such, and
moreover his full name, which is Omar-
Al-Khareem El Wahlid Hussein Bin
Salmani and some more too, and Happy
Steve does not see how we can stroll out
of the Iraqi Embassy with this object
about our persons. In fact, it seems
Happy Steve is rather displeasured
altogether, but with Shifty Shan in
particular, and he says:
'I regard Shifty Shan's conduct in
leaving us to carry out matters by
ourselves as ungentlemanly in the
extreme, and furthermore, I think he is
nothing but a low-down sabbo, at that.'
Now sabbo is a most degrading term
used to describe citizens who selflessly
devote themselves to the common good
of the population for a very unsatisfactory
salary, like Shifty Shan, when they are
not doing their sacred and bounden duty,
like Shifty Shan. However, I think it is
very improper of Happy Steve to refer to
Shifty Shan in this manner, so I say to
him, 'Steve, sabbo is not such a word as I
like to hear being used about any citizen,
because it is most undignified, and what
is more,' I say, 'it is illiterate.' However,
this only riles him up more, and he looks
as if he is about to haul off and punch
me in the snoot, so I step back, and
nearly step on Little Chas. But by this
time, Paul Reynish has the old tools out,
and he is removing the sign as smoothly
as I ever see a sign removed, and I wish
to say that I see a great many signs
removed in my time.
Well, at this point, everything is looking
very hotsy-totsy, and the only remaining
snag which may upset things is that if the
coppers give us the eye very closely
when we come out, they may notice that
we are carrying some property with us,
and naturally they will wish to know if
we have permission to borrow it.
However, Penguin, whose mind is well
known to be no Limburger when it
comes to tricky problems, suggests that
we bundle up Little Chas like he is
injured and carry him out on the sign, as
though it is a stretcher such as the
quacks use to carry injured persons. Little
Chas expresses no little indignation at
this, and states that he does not wish to
be bundled up in any manner, shape or
form, but Penguin boffs him on the
noggin with a Rag can that Penguin has
brought along in case anybody wishes to
give us any money for the sick elephants
or whatever, so that Little Chas does not
