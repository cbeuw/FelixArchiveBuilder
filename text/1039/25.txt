academic dress
I can't say I feel a great deal dif-
ferent now I'm editor, BSc
ARCS. Commemoration Day
was very definitely an inconve-
nience, not an excitement. It was
wearing a silly garment that kept
getting caught in the photocopi-
er, and having to sit still for three
hours. And I felt something of a
fraud when my parents insisted
on being proud and taking pho-
tographs.
I wondered if they realised
just how many lectures I missed,
how many problem sheets I
copied, how little I appreciated
the priviledge of learning at an
elite centre of excellence. But
somehow, watching the couple
of thousand of us be mis-pro-
nounced across the stage one by
one I did find my self wondering
what we would all end up doing
with our degrees from Imperial
College of Science Technolgy
and Medicine.
I am extremely grateful to
all those I left behind to finish
Felix last week, even if they
phoned at 3.30am to tell me that
the fuse needed to be changed in
the collating machine plug.
onwards
Judging by next week's
careers fair, we're all heading
unavoidably towards a future in
financial services. There are a
great many difficult questions in
this life, but at this present
moment I'm really wondering if
the world genuinely needs so
many merchant bankers. What
was the point of all those years of
quantum mechanics if we're all
to spend our futures talking in
silly acronyms about Quality
Value Customer Thresholds.
portillo
There aren't a great many perks
to being Felix editor, but I knew
it was all worthwhile when I got
to spend a few short minutes
with the Secretary of State for
defense. I'm sorry, Ian Bayley,
but it just has to be said: Michael
Portillo is quite simply the per-
son who is the most unpleasant,
most comprehensively devoid of
human sensitivity that I have
ever met.
So there.
