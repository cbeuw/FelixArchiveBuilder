gig/interview: trans-global
underground xi
After an excellent set from Tribal Drift,
some funky hip-hop from Eusebe and admirable
mixing from Coldcut, we were finally treated to
Transglobal Underground. So was it worth the
wait?
Well, quite a few of the crowd failed to take
the pace when confronted with an extended 90
minute set and encore. The music was never
frantic but the beats grabbed you by the scruff of
the neck and forced you to dance. I was sur-
prised by the breadth of the set, which had
everything from crashing guitar riffs and rapping
to extensive bongo and drum workouts.
and is the driving force that holds their diverse
sound together.
The band hopes to find time in the New Year
to take a month of gigging to record a new
album, from which they should get an entirely
new live set. If the material they played tonight
is anything to go by, then this will be well worth
checking out.
Asked if they have any message to get across,
Dubla said that they want to try and break down
barriers in music, building on the start they've
already made. Apparendy, Natacha wants to see
multi-ethnic music raised to the same level of
prominence that it has in France, Belgium and
the Netherlands, where it receives regular radio
play.

Before the gig, I chatted to the band's bassist,
Dubla, who promised that they would play four
or five new songs. They didn't disappoint and
although the fans cheered the fami liar 'na-na,
na-na-ner' of old favourite 'Temple Head', I
couldn't help diinking that it was overshadowed
by the newer material.
It's easy to see how vocalist Natacha Atlas
maintains a solo career in addition to her work
with the band. Her mix of singing and Indian
style chants underpins all of Transglobal's music
If there is one thing the band hates, it's
pigeon-holing. Dubla tells me half-jokingly that if
they ever manage to completely categorise
Transglobal then he'll move on. He talks at length
on the stupidity of the system and decides that
he wants Transglobal to be the next Britpop
band. Tme to his word the band announced,
'Well, well, Britpop goes multiracial" over the
PA at the end of the gig. Looking at the smiles on
people's faces after the gig, I can only hope so.
album: superchunk -
here's where the strings
come iruk
It's all in a name. Unfortunately for Superchunk,
the reference to large vomit' in their name is
true. The band appear to be Bob Mould
wannabees who have veered towards Madder
Rose but lost the whole plot along the way, while
'Here's where the strings come in' sounds as
though it was recorded in someone's garage on a
DAT machine.
Recent single, Hyper Enough' is the highest
quality fare on offer. But, it's the first song and
from here on the album gets progressively worse.
From 'Iron On' onwards there is a deep gorge of
songs that all sound the same so it's not a case of
the best being save .until last.
I had great hopes for this album since
Superchunk had supported the great Teenage
Fanclub. Alas, this time the Fannies' judgement
proved to be just about as good as Jacques
Chirac's nuclear policy. Oh well, we all make
mistakes. (3)
album: asian dub
foundation - facts and
fictions,.
iaul shore
I didn't know what to expect but I was
impressedrightfromthe start of this album with
the fusion of Eastern rhythms and Western
beats.
The album contains a unique blend of musi-
cal genres, with tracks ranging from the incredi-
bly mellow 'Journey' to some very hard edged
rap tunes towards the end of the album. They
even lay a strong, funky electric guitar sound over
ajungle beat on 'TH9', while 'Thacid' could have
been written by Josh Wink.
As their name would suggest, there are a lot
of Asian style melodies. However, these are not
so much emphasised as blended in with the var-
ied collection of instrumental and sampled
sounds and this mixture of styles compensates
for the lyrics, which sound a little harsh at times.
All in all, the twelve tracks cover a lot of
ground and this is well worth a listen. (7)
