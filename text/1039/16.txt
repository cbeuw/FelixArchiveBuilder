Teacher Sifu Andrew Sofos
"The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a
matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin.
Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account
be neglected."
Sun Tzu 500 BC
"Don't neglect this marvellous opportunity for you to learn
a practical and highly treasured martial art. Surely your
life is worth more than £2.50 per lesson."
Sifu A. Sofos 1995 AD
