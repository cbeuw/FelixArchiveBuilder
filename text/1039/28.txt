Goals from M a r k
Ferguson (2), Richard
Craig, Amoafo A n i m -
Addo, and a splendid indi-
vidual effort by M i k e
Jarvis maintained the first
team's promiding start to
the season, and were just
rewards for I.C.'s
"Brazilian like" football.
With two wins out of two
in B U S A to date hopes are
high that our men could
progress well in the tour-
nament this year.
On Saturday, I.C.'s IVth XI
took a first half lead against
Q.M.W. through an Ian Archer
header. The result was never in
any real doubt, and second-half
goals from Morgan, Demitrios
and a Gazza brace sealed a solid
all round performance.

The RSM First team enjoyed
their opening win of the season
over local rivals St. Mary's
thanks to superb efforts from
Hamish "The Silky Scotsman"
Maclntyre and the underrated
Simon Hiscocks(I wonder who
wrote this?-Ed.). It seems that
the RSM lst's are getting their
act together, which is more than
can be said for the second XI.
Despite last week's 9-0 destruc-
tion of the Royal Vets,
Wednesday's 3-2 defeat at the
hands of UMDS was a dire
spectacle, and it is the general
opinion that the second half was
one to be forgotten, despite the
obvious bitterness over the ref-
eree's more dubious decisions.

Newcastle United clung to the top of
the Premiership after an immensely
entertaining 1-1 draw with struggling
Spurs. United always had the upper hand
and were full of attacking flair, but
Tottenham always looked as if they might
score on the break.
Australia won the Halifax
Centenary Rugby League Cup Final on
Saturday by emphaticaly beating
England 16-8 at Wembley." When you
make as many errors and concede as
many penalties as we did you are com-

Phil Larder.

teams
finally stop
the rot
Wednesday afternoon and the
I.C. bandwagon was put firmly
back on the road with a 18-6
first team win over the previous-
ly undefeated Q.M.W. Tries by
Matt Toolan, Simon Hall and
the Eric Cantona of Imperial
rugby Jean-Phillipe Oesterle
ensured that a gritty and much
improved pack performance was
duly rewarded.
Men of the match were the
"rampaging" John Cassidy and
the "mercurial" Simon Fuller
(Who really uses these adjec-
tives? -Ed), whose huge pres-
ence capped the best team
effort of the previously dreadful
start to the season.
Our second string unfortu-
nately did not fare as well, and
an abysmal start led to a 38
point half time deficit. However
the captain harangued the team
during the break, and a score
each from John Evans and James
Weekes, from superbly execut-
ed forward play restored pride
to the Imperial ranks. "The final
score (10-52) did not really
reflect the performance," said
one player.
Finally, we come to the
nailbiting win enjoyed by the
3rd team. In spite of going
down to two pushover tries
QMW did not give up, but were
spurred to greater efforts, and
two tries brought them perilous-
ly close to I.C.'s lead. In the end
only a missed conversion seper-
ated the sides in this hugely
enter taining contest.
