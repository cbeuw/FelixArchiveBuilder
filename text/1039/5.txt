The political consensus
regarding the future of higher
education is at first sight seam-
less, differing only in the choice
of buzzwords. All parties propose
passing on some of the cost of
higher education to the students
- an acknowledgement at last
that the tax system cannot
entirely support a mass higher
education system.
The Conservative National
Policy Group on HE, along with
Labour and the Lib Dem's would
like to see HE expansion contin-
ued and sincerely believe that
they can do this without raising
doubts about quality.
The actual outcome will of
course depend on the result of
the next election, but also on the
contribution that the student
movement makes to this discus-
sion. And this is where the prob-
lems begin.
Earlier this year the NUS
confirmed its anachronistic and
Utopian posture by refusing to
support a call for ruthless reform
of HE funding. Instead it grasped
on to the ephemeral tenet on
which its existence depends - a
restoration of grants to 1979 lev-
els and reinstatement of benefits.
The NUS finances depend
on student acceptance of credu-
lous platitudes which are
wheeled out to every dewy eyed
and shivering fresher counting
pennies at Christmas. Any help-
ful idea has to combat student
poverty, explode the myth of
'free education' and reject the
Perhaps not, but Nooman Haque
explains who might soon.
patronising doctrine that soci-
ety is in debt to students.
'New Solutions' is an
assemblage of 100 student
unions who are encouraging
students to partake in the
debate. The group is lead by
Ghassan Karrian, President
of ULU and supported by
Sarah White, President
of Imperial.
I do not doub
the sincerity of this
movement but I
do question the
motives of Mr
Karrian. The J
clue which
gives the
game away
is the adjunctive
'New' - the Blair hall-
mark to describe rehashed
Tory policies.
The incumbent Baron of
Castle Malet will be only too
pleased to show you around his
Kingdom, and in particular
show off his treasure trove of
prominent Labour front
benchers. Mr. Karrian (a
Labour councillor) appears to
be destined for the Commons
and in this respect his actions
could be interpreted as part of
his career drive (though stories
of students slipping up on the
road from Bloomsbury to
Whitehall as a result of his oily
progress are unsubstantiated).

One could also assume that
he is testing Labour policy
amongst the students and thus
working more for them than
for those that was elected to
serve. The issue is a serious one
and remains to be resolved. Mr
Karrian is paid by ULU
and should act and
think in
accor-
d a n c e
with the
needs of
J his con-
stituents, not
those of his
Labour friends.
The effects that a
politically biased
national student
organisation have been
devastating to the stu-
dent movement in the
past. In 1992 the NUS encour-
aged students to vote Labour in
marginal constituencies. This
high profile campaign only
encouraged the Conservative
government to speed up it's
Voluntary Membership Bill -
designed to curb student union
power and remove government
funding for student sports,
societies and entertainments.
The actions of the NUS nearly
killed off the SU's that pay a
premium for it's rather shoddy
service. This greedy cabal of
Leftists should be dismantled
and the (comparatively) efficient
services (NUS Legal and NUS
Ents) should go their separate
ways, allowing subscribing SU's
to pay according to their specific
needs
I wonder too if the other
student unions involved in 'New'
Solutions are aware of Mr.
Karrian's left leaning tendency,
particularly our own Ms. White,
who has offered her e-mail
address to field enquiries about
the group.
Perhaps Miss White is aware
but fears the charismatic Mr
Karrian, or perhaps she too has
ambitions Westminster way (it is
more likely however that she
skips happily through the blos-
soming meadows of ignorance
and innocence and to credit her
with being so shrewd as Mr.
Karrian is a generous and purely
hypothetical extension of her
abilities).
Either way, the lack of a
clear statement declaring politi-
cal impartiality clouds the impor-
tant debate which Mr Karrian
and Miss White have entrusted
themselves to lead. Their desire
to encourage student wide
debate is welcome but with the
cloud of uncertainty over their
motives is rather hard to lift. If
we are to provide input into the
debate, Mr. Karrian, we must
know what and for whom you
stand.
OPTIONS: The major parties' views on higher education funding.
Conservative Party
Keep lid on growth of HE and
develop more lower level cours-
es. Eventual elimination of grant
and introduction of comprehen-
sive loan system to cover mainte-
nance. Radical Tories want
vouchers for fees payment.
Labour Party
Continued expansion of HE, cre-
ating "Seamless robes of learn-
ing", "University for Industry",
"learning accounts" and "learning
bank" i.e students, state and
employers contribute to a reser-
voir of cash. Don't like fees
vouchers but favour "learning
entitlements".
Liberal Democrats
Continued expansion of HE. Also
favour "learning accounts".
Maintenance paid for by state
and fees paid back after second
year.
NUS
Reinstatement of housing benefit
and income support. Return to
1979 level of student grant
(approx cost at least 7p on
income tax).
New Solutions
Loan system for maintenance
grants. Employer contributions
for tuition.
