Linstead Scapegoated in Halloween Debacle
BY J O N A T H A N T R O U T
The most serious disturbances of
the term occurred on Tuesday
night, when the activities of
Linstead and Southside residents
resulted in the Police being called
to Prince's Gardens. The com-
plaints of local residents have fur-
ther resulted in the indefinite
closure of the Linstead Bar.
The annual Southside
Halloween party, held on the
building's upper gallery, devel-
oped into a lively occasion with a
constant, but not especially high,
level of noise emanating from the
high rise block. This was not a
particular problem until a fire
alarm in Linstead Hall led to the
expulsion of at least 150 students
into the Prince's Gardens area.
With some of the newly
arrived freshers in a fairly inebri-
ated state, the ritual banter start-
ed up between Southside and
Linstead Halls. Following the
retreat of the Linstead Hall resi-
dents after the all clear, the
Southside residents were then
required to evacuate their halls
when their fire alarms sounded.
With students now in fine voice,
the exchange continued between
the grounded Southsiders and
the Linstead revellers.
Upon the arrival of Ian
Caldwell, Director of Estates,
the Linstead residents gave
grudging acquiescence to his
requests for calm, and returned
inside. At this point the incident
should have ended, but for a fur-
ther fire alarm in Linstead Hall.
Following this evacuation the
police arrived on the now
charged, yet good humoured,
scene. After a short chat with
Earl Lancaster, the Linstead Hall
Warden, the police departed.
After some coercive words

dismissed suggestions in national
papers that they have already

from their Warden, the Linstead
residents returned inside, in
most cases to their rooms.
However John Hassard, Warden
of Falmouth Keogh Hall, who
was not present at the scene,
commented: "it was like a riot,
and riotous behaviour is deeply
regretful."
The concern of College
authorities over the allegedly
high level of student alcohol con-
sumption later manifested itself
with the Rector, Sir Ronald
Oxburgh's instruction, to close
Linstead Hall's bar. Some have
raised questions as to the wisdom
of this action. One of the Bar
Committee members working
that evening told Felix that most
of the student drinking took
place not in the Linstead bar but
in the Southside Disco.
With the Director of Estates
being close at hand in his 47
Prince's Gardens College flat to
witness the proceedings, resi-
dents have been told officially by
the Rector that the bar will not
be available until students
'behave in a reasonable and
responsible' manner.
With suggestions that
College has been seeking to close
the bar for some time, residents
speculate whether the popular
social amenity will ever reopen.
This, together with the unfair-
ness of not closing Southside's
more profitable licensed premis-
es were matters on which nei-
ther Sir Ronald or Mr Caldwell
were available to comment. Both
the ICU President, and Mr
Lancaster were said to be "bewil-
dered" by the decision. Sarah
White said: "This seems like a
violent, knee-jerk reaction from
someone not in possession of all
the facts."
