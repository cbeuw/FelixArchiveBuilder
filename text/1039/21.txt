Photographic
Society
The photographic society has has started the
new year dynamically, looking for inspiration
in the cinema. We visited the 'magnum
cinema' exhibition at the Royal Festival Hall
which commemorates the centenary of
cinema, featuring two hundred dazzling
photographs which capture all aspects of
film-making.
We witnessed Marilyn Monroe's
magical love affair with the camera, and
were amused by Phillippe Halsman's
successful photograph of her famous wiggle.
Nicolas Tikhomiroff expressed the mood of
his characters with his exceptional use of
light.We were so bewitched by the brilliant
show that we could not keep our hands off
the merchandise; postcards, keyrings, and
even toilet paper with a musical score on it.
Along the way, we kept loosing members as
they "quickly" took photographs of the
scenery along the Thames. The trip ended
with a cup of coffee and a long conversation
on eveyones' aspirations of being famous.
The Society meets every Tuesday in
Southside Lounge at 1.00 pm, so come along
and find out what we get up to, or contact us
