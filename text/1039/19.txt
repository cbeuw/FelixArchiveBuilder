mr
With 3 weeks remairring
of our holiday we broke
south from Peru and
crossed the border into
Bolivia at the border town
of Copacabana.
Bolivia is the poorest country in the western
hemisphere and it certainly shows, there are
only 2 paved roads in the whole of the country
and luckily we travelled one of them into La
Paz. La Paz is renowned as being the highest
capital in the world - not true. It is not the
capital of Bolivia, merely its biggest city and
centre of commerce... I digress. More worrying
than La Paz's lack of bona fide tide is its lack of
breathable air; sat in a valley below the Andean
Altiplano it is at 4000m above sea level and is
where Olympic
athletes train before
competitions. After
life in London, a
good 30m above sea
level (50m if you're
on the second floor)
La Paz proved to be
literally breath-taking
and the slightest
exertion would leave
you gasping like a
fish on dry land. The
one advantage of all
this puffing and
panting is that upon
return to Britain, you
feel like you have
super-human
strength.
South East of La
Paz lies the city of
Potsoi. A silver town
during Spanish mle,
it is now mined co-
operatively by the local men. These "men"
(starting at age 10) live on what silver they
mine, some carry over a ton of metal ore on
their backs in a day in tunnels 4ft high by
candlelight and for their trouble they will earn
£5 a day. They are doing well if they live to be
50, though many will die in cave-ins before
that. They only let us 'Gringos' in because we
come bearing gifts; coca leaves for their
endurance, fuel for their lamps, dynamite for
their mining, that sort of thing.
South West of Potsoi in the Altiplano lies one
of the world's largest salt plains, the 'Salar
d'Uyuni'. 10 billion tons of virtually pure salt
stretching dead flat across hundreds of square
kilometres of land, broken up only by the
occasional lone island of rock. Local belief is
that it was formed when the seas dried up and
all of the fish were turned into islands. When I
asked why Bolivia's economic situation could
not be improved by export of this salt, I was
told of how Chile took Bolivia's one access to
the ocean rendering it landlocked. This land
will be returned within a decade when Chile
has exhausted the
silver mines there
which currently
constitute 10% of its
m Gross Domestic
Product.
H From Uyuni I
travelled back to La
Paz on one of the
world's highest
railways and from
La Paz back to Lima
and from there to
London. The
sadness at leaving
these places and
• especially the people
was immense. The
geography is
stunning but it is the
people that endear
themselves to you.
I They're not in the
rat race, they take
each day as it comes
and it may sound
blessedly simple but its not - its hard. Its also
extremely well worth seeing with your own
eyes. Contact me, James Madden, via the Felix
office if you like.
