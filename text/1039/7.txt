REAL LIFE FELIX FRIDAY 3RD NOVEMBER 1995 . SEVEN
A close encounter of
the swM(s)Il@m hin
It was a nice, bright
morning near the end
of the Easter Holidays
in April 1995.
Two things crept into my
mind as I woke up that morning;
Cornflakes and differential equa-
tions. The former because I was
hungry and needed some break-
fast, the latter because I couldn't
do them and needed to know
how to in order to prevent my
first year exams from descending
into farce.
Breakfast and mathematics
had been uppermost in my mind
for at least the last few mornings,
but something else was to hap-
pen that same day which was to
change my life for the next fifty,
well, twenty, no,say ten, well,
alright, three, days. But the odd
thing wasn't so much that I felt
my life had changed, but the fact
that it should have been affected
at all. Or this life, at any rate...
"This is Peter," my .mother
said, gesturing to the large, mid-
dle-aged genial man who was at
our breakfast table talking to my
father. By this time, I'd decided
that cornflakes were a far higher
priority than differential equa-
tions. She ushered me into a
chair, adding, "He's a spiritual-
ist."
An alarm bell in the back of
my mind started ringing. For me,
spiritualism and science went
together nowhere near as well as,
say, union ents managers and
strange trousers. I was an engi-
neering student. At Imperial
College. I had no time for Russell
Grant wannabees peddling pseu-
doscience. Differential equations
suddenly seemed like far more
reassuring territory. So what did
I do?
"Erm, hello, Peter, how do
you do?" I mumbled cautiously,
shaking the proferred hand. I sat
down, feeling as though I'd
crossed some point of no return
in etiquette terms. But there was
a way out. I'd have my corn-
flakes, exchange a few pleas-
antries, talk about the weather,
gasp in horror at my watch and
say I'd need to do some exam
revision, escaping to the compar-
ative freedom of differential
equations. Easy...
He chatted to my parents
and sister for a while, talking
about spirits, etheric bodies,
astral projection and the like,
while I crunched through my
cornflakes. I listened, geniunely
interested. And then I was sur-
prised at being interested. This
wasn't right. It wasn't what any
self-respecting engineering pupil
would be seen dead doing, talk-
ing to a spiritualist, if that's what
he was. But the real shock had
yet to come.
Apparently completely off
the cuff, he asked, "We've met
before, haven't we?"
"Erm, have we?" it was cer-
tainly news to me if we had.
"We were both priests in a
temple. This wasn't a few years
ago, or hundreds of years ago,
we're talking tens of thousands
of years ago - "
I gaped.
" - and," he paused dramati-
cally, "You were just as stubborn
and irksome then as you are
now!" He laughed.
I gaped some more. What
did he mean, "stubborn and irk-
some"? More to the point, what
was all that about priests and
temples and thousands of years?
I asked him, and he told me. Not
this life but another, one of thou-
sands that each one us lived. I
was more than just a mere IC
engineer, though that was what I
was now. He told me about eter-
nal souls, about reincarnation,
about my aura and the colours
that it was showing, that the fact
that Buddhists got it right and
everyone else was wrong, man,
just wrong.
But that was the scary part.
Peter wasn't talking like some
washed-up sixties druggie. He
was terrifyingly ordinary, a man
with a family who wouldn't have
looked out of place dishing out
financial advice in Barclay's. He
spoke with a conviction borne of
experience, a man who claimed
that he'd had the ability to read
aurae - a person's spiritual bar-
code, of you like - since the age
of nine. Either that, or he was
lying.
I felt good. I'd found out
something interesting about
myself and about life. But then I
felt bad about feeling good. I
wasn't meant to be interested. I
was a man of engineering, a stu-
dent of the sciences, and pro-
found sceptic of all things non-
scientific. Where were his equa-
tions, his graphs, his tables, his
references to papers in Nature
magazine? And I began to feel
good about feeling bad about
feeling good. At last, scientific
objectivity and watertightness
had prevailed over metaphysical
wooliness. But then I began to
feel bad about feeling good about
feeling bad about feeling good.
Was a science-based education
closing my mind to concepts that
science was too arrogant to
admit that it couldn't explain?
Peter took leave of us later
that morning, vanishing out of
my life as abruptly as he had
entered it. Well, this life, at
least. I thought that making a
joke about seeing him again in
another few thousand years
would have been a bit tactless, so
I left it at that.
Holidays ended, and exams
loomed. Mad weeks of over-
working, undersleeping, under-
eating and undershaving ensued.
Exams, a bit of Felix hackery,
and foreign holidays passed by,
and mornings where I'd get up
thinking of cornflakes but not,
mercifully, differential equa-
tions. But for a while afterwards,
I couldn't help viewing people
differently. My family, all my
friends, everybody it seemed,
had been roaming the planet for
millenia, jumping from life to
life, person to person, country to
country, inhabiting one mass of
organic machinery for a few
fleeting decades before moving
onto another, and having no rec-
ollection of the previous one.
I had conversations with a
longtime friend of my parents,
who really did dish out financial
advice in Barclay's, talking about
the Theosophical Society, about
Blavatski, and even Albert
Einstein, and Richard Feynman.
Men who were not merely
accepted by the establishment
but had actually come to person-
ify it, yet once their plaudits and
Nobel Prizes had been safely
pocketed they turned some of
their attention to matters of the
mind, of life, death, birth,
rebirth. Matters which that same
establishment has steered well
clear of, dismissing it as the
realm of cranks and fortune-
tellers. Not that it's easily under-
stood, though.
I think I prefer differential
equations. They're far more
respectable.
