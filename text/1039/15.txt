Way back in the echelons of Felix history, I
remember writing: "Let's get one thing straight -
The Alarm were a great band (a statement
which should exterminate any street cred I pos-
sess)." Well, twenty-eight issues later, and still
with no street cred to my name, I'm ready to
revise that opinion. Because, after seeing ex-
Alarm frontman Mike Peters performing an
acoustic show of songs old and new, the only
conclusion I can draw is that The Alarm weren't
a great band - they were a brilliant one. (But then
I really knew that anyway.)
ness, he jovially retorted: "I think that we've got
a few trainspotters in here tonight."
And yet it's remarkable that there aren't
more of the same sort of 'trainspotters' around.
'68 Guns', Where were you hiding when the
storm broke?', 'Spirit of 76', 'One step closer to
home' and 'No frontiers', to name but a few, are
songs that take in influences as diverse as the
Clash and the Stones, that had something unpre-
tentious and important to say, and yet which lie
neglected by so many.
Not that this is supposed to sound like an
epitaph. Far from it. The U K and forthcoming
US tours are packed to the rafters and the solo

nonetheless..:
Armed with a guitar, a voice and a passion-
ate dedication to his trade, Mike played two and
a half hours of almostflawlessgems spanning a
fifteen year history.
The songs were interspersed with anecdotes
and humour - a testament to Mike's ongoing
bonhomie with his fans. On one occasion, when
a large number of obscurities were being
requested by fans eager to prove their die-hardi-
material, mainly taken from last year's debut,
'Breathe', stands up entirely on its own merits.
The new songs may not have quite managed to
capture the exquisiteness of old yet but as
proven tonight, they will certainly age well. And
in an era of meaningless, hungover music culture,
that's way more than you've reason to expect.
like I once said - Mike Peters deserves your
attention now.
album: the smashing
pumpkins - mellon collie
and infinite sadness^sshopper
To spend 24 hours with the Smashing Pumpkins
would be impossible joy. To spend two hours or
so with this album in their royal presence is thus
but a bareable compression. Split betwixt two
halves, perfecdy complementary, like night and
day, dawn and dusk, rest 28 new tracks. The two
CDs, crammed with the same number of years
worth of Billy Corgan's meticulously woven
melodies, may be verging on the verbose, but
then we're not being given a tour of McD's.
In contrast with most other big bands, the
Pumpkins haven't "matured", "progressed", or
"diversified", not because they tried not to, but
because everything they do is peculiarly idiosyn-
cratic.
Corgan's lyrics may be at times self-indul-
gent, not to mention inaccessible, but songs like
'Bodies', 'Thirty-three' and 'Bullet with...'
redeem his stature and hark to the earlier days of
'Gish' and 'Siamese Dream'.
Though not every track is a gorging grunge
landmark, to attempt superficial comparisons to
80's style revival would be totally out of place.
Sweet cherishable numbers like 'Stumbleine',
'By starlight' and 'Farewell and goodnight' are
evidence enough for me that Corgan's talent,
relentiessly emitted from my C D player, is
unique.
Incidentally, the last song calls on the hith-
erto unexposed voice of James Iha, making you
wonder if this man could possibly attain saintiy
status. He also wrote "Take me down" (a sure
contender for the tide of best-track) not so
much a love song as a ray of hope at the twilight
of Corgan's bitter day. I wish it was mine.
Now you may think that dais is hopeless
infatuation, but you'd be wrong. There is no
other reason to buy this album other than for
pure musical delight. Don't pretend you need to
understand it, you don't. (8)
