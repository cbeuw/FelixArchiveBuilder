Albert Hall Funding Uncertain
Confusion
over £40m
Lottery
Payout
renovations
BY AAARK BRIDGE
David Elliot, the Deputy Chief
Executive of the Royal Albert
Hall, has said that there is still no
sign of whether their application
for £40 million pounds of lottery
funding had been successful.
This follows recent reports
which cast doubt over the suc-
cess of the Albert Hall's applica-
tion for Lottery funds to renovate
the historic Hall's surrounding
area.
In an interview with Felix
Mr Elliot explained that any
money that 'came their way'
would be used to expand the
nine year programme of 'recon-
struction and betterment'. This
plan is in trouble as it is being
currently funded by internal bud-
get surpluses. The stated goals of
the ongoing scheme are to
improve the atmosphere and
enjoyment for patrons, perform-
ers, and promoters alike.
Part of the plan involves the
restoration of the building's
ancient ventilation system to its
original design, which optimised
natural convection effects, and
removed blockages that were
installed to conform to fire regu-
lations.
Permission has also been
obtained for the rebuilding of a
conservatory on the south side of
the Hall, rehousing restaurants,
cloakrooms, and other amenities
that were moved into the main
body of the building when the
original was destroyed earlier this
century.
Part of the strategy involves
the creation of a level under the
building extending through to
Prince Consort Road. Access
would be via the sliproads either
side of the main stairway oppo-
site the Royal School of Music.
These roads currently lead to
underground parking for resi-
dents.
The extra space generated
by the changes will become a ser-
vice yard allowing rigging to be
carried under the building and
lifted onto the stage. Further
dressing room space will also be
created.
Another major alteration will
be the pedestrianisation of the
road that encircles the Albert
Hall, "to create something like
Covent Garden, with cars able to
go in and out". Over 1,600 of the
Hall's seats are scheduled to be
modernised, and permission has
also been granted for the side
entrances to be glazed so as to
create more foyer space.
The refurbishments have an
estimated cost of £5 7m. If the
£40m application to the Lottery
fund is accepted, the project is
scheduled to begin within a year.
The media may have influ-
enced the application's outcome,
as they appear to have induced
political controversy over alloca-
tion of grants to 'highbrow' arts
Media Criticism of
Heritage Commission
National media have extensively
covered the heritage commission
desicion, but some of the jounal-
ism seems as biased as the claims
of money mis-distribution itself.
The Sunday Times purported
that the Albert Hall will be allo-
cated £40m of lottery funds for
major works on the building,
though they quoted the Chief
Executive as saying he had yet to
hear of any such decision. This
appears to be born out by a state-
ment to issued to Hall employees
saying "Despite the story in the
Sunday Times ... subsequently
repeated in other newspapers;
the Hall has received no indica-
tion yet as to whether our appli-
cation has been successful..."
There were also reports of com-
plaints by Midlands MPs that too
much money had already been
invested in the South.
On Monday October 23rd
The Daily Telegraph wrote of
how big charities had a drop of
14% in donations. The
Independent carried a story on
how smaller organisations, such
as one for Eritrean Refugees,
were considered for lottery
money. Richard Branson [who
bid unsuccessfully against
Camelot] said that the Lottery
was being driven by greed that
might lead to the same disrepute
as the 'fat cat' bosses of the pri-
vatised utilities.
Wednesday's Times and
Daily Telegraph explained the
Church of England's view that
the Lottery "Exploits the vulner-
able and undermines the public
good". Both then pointed out
that the Church had made appli-
cations for £19m and had already
received Elm. Staying with
Church issues on Thursday, The
Daily Telegraph said the Church
of Scotland would not be making
any applications. The British
Medical Journal reported a 17%
increase in the number of calls to
Gamblers Anonymous and
blamed the BBC for over-public-
ity. They claimed that right wing
Tories were pressing Kenneth
Clarke to disregard plans to raise
taxes on lottery takings.
