SPORT FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 3RD NOVEMBER 1995 . TWENTY-SEVEN
No messing about on the river at
the 1995 Henley Royal Regatta
Late last June,the I.C. Boat Club
put the victories of the preceed-
ing months behind them and
focused their attention towards
the 1995 Henley Royal Regatta
and Woman's Henley.
The woman's crew entered
the College Eights event with the
confidence of being U A U
Champions by a considerable
margin. This confidence was not
misplaced in the initial rounds in
which they destroyed the Oxford
college crews of St.John's and
Wolfson. However the major
threat and eventual defeat cae
from across the Atlantic. The
mammoth Wisconsin University
Eight was just too fast, in a time
ten seconds quicker than the win-
ners of the next event up.
In the college fours event,
after coming through to beat
Edinburgh from being a length
behind at halfway, the women
did not have the strength in
reserve to overhaul a strong
Exeter challenge. In club fours,
the Imperial crew met the even-
tual winners in the first round
and pushed them closer than
any other team.
At the Henley Royal
Regatta I.C.'s men again
fronted strong entries in
many events, and spirted per-
formances were seen in the
hotly contested Brittania,
Visitor's, and Temple
Challenge Cups. However,
most of the attention was
centred on the controverial
"bumping-up" of the College
first eight from the "Temple"
to the more prestigious
Thames Challenge for Club
Eights.
The Temple eight was
made up of two previous
Henley winners and mem-
bers of the development squad.
They started their campaign with
a slightly shaky performance
against.an American college crew
but with the steadying influence
of the previous Club Captain,
Tom Miller and 1994 winner
John Moore on board, the crew
sucessfully qualified for the next
day's race against Kingston
Grammar School. One of the
go on though to represent
Imperial in Canada as part of an
Alumnus weekend where they
performed well.
I.C. colours were also well
represented as a Queen's Tower

best school crews this year, they
proved themselves slightly too
much for the recently formed
I.C. eight , who soon found the
other attractions that the regatta
has to offer.

peting in the Temple eight were
always going to have a difficult
time and found themselves
slightly off the pace, the four did
coxless pair, racing in the Silver
Goblets. This boat was stoked by
Martin Kettle, now an I.C. alum-
ni and a previous twice winner at
Henley. He and his partner Dave
Gillard, formerly of Cambridge,
were clearly in the top two pairs
at the regatta. However, when
you come up against Redgrave
and Pinsent, presently four
times world champions and
world record holders, even an
I.C. rower could be forgiven
for losing. Dave and Martin
were knocked out in the
semi-finals, where the
Leander pair slashed thirteen
seconds off their own course
record.
The "bumped-up" College
First eight looked to have a
tough job on their hands in
the higher event, with many
American entries and some of
the faster British crews,
including the Goldie eight
from Cambridge, who had
made only one change since
the Boat Race. After a confi-
dent procession to Saturday they
drew the favorites, Goldie. In a
race which was described by one
international reporter as "the
most impressive row of the day"
the Imperial boys sped up the
course leaving the Cambridge
Squad with no answer to finish in
a whipping 6 min 06 sec, taking a
full three seconds off the previ-
ous record. A difficult win over a
good Notts County crew meant a
final against the undefeated
University of Washington Junior
Varsity. The race was won within
the first minute and Imperial
hammered the point home in
style to win by nearly four
lengths to gain the club its fifth
Henley event in four years.
