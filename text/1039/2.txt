Unfinished: Installation of smoke detectors has taken over a year

Residents of Southside Halls are
set to be subjected to daily early
morning fire alarm tests for
another month.
The alarms have been sound-
ed at 9am each day since the
unsuccessful fire practice on
October 17th. Alarms failed to
go off on staircases two and four
leaving residents unaware of the
warning to evacuate the building.
However, Prof G New and Dr J
Hassard, the hall's wardens, said
they were satisfied with the
turnout of the other staircases. In
an open letter to the four halls,
they said that there were to be no
further fire practices this term,
so alarms should be taken seri-
ously.
The source of the problem is
the 15 year old alarm control sys-
tem, sections of which have
taken to spontaneous failure.
Due to the disappearance of the
installation details necessary for
fault location, the only means of
tracing failures is trying the sys-
tem and seeing if it works. Faced
with concerns of student safety if
the system failed between test-
ings, Graham Cox, College Fire
Officer, said the system had
overlap and that he was satisfied
with the level of protection cur-
rently offered.
Although the present fire
protection is perfectly legal for
student residences, it is well
below the standard required by
the Fire Precaution Act (1972)
for paying members of the pub-
lic. The sole reason Southside
currently holds hotel status is
due to a loophole in the law. As it
has applied for certification,
pending a visit from the fire
department, the dubious nature
of the system is given the benefit
of the doubt.
Similar to one in Linstead
Hall, the system is currently
partly installed and will be
brought on line over the next few
weeks. It will have the capability
to pinpoint fires down to the
nearest room, report disablement
or breakdowns and detect
cannabis smoke. Students who
burn their food are still a prob-
lem that hopefully the Fire
Department will solve, but the
new hardware should be in place
by the end of November until
which time testing will continue.
News in brief
'Beit Option'
Considered
An initial sounding of the 'Beit
Option' has been the concern of
Imperial College's Estates
Division this week, as Ian Frame,
Director of Planning, went on a
walkabout with Union staff. The
party looked at the various parts
of the Union building that would
be moved or altered if the pro-
posal is taken up by the College.
Sarah White said that the
College has been "fiddling
around with the idea", and will
be doing some rough costing over
the next few weeks. She added
that most of the work has been
done already as the Biology part
of Beit had been dissected in the
original plans. However, Ian
Frame commented that the idea
has not yet gone to the quantity
surveyors and reiterated that the
costs have to balance.
Labour Whip
Stephen Byers, Labour MP for
Wallsend, was a guest of Imperial
College Union Labour Club on
October 20th. He is seen as one
of the brightest young stars in the
Parliamentary Labour Party
becoming party Whip recently.
He spoke to a sizeable gath-
ering on a range of issues includ-
ing sleaze and arms sales to Iran
and Iraq, both topical issues sub-
ject to inquiries by Nolan and
Scott. However, many members
of the audience were surprised
that Mr Byers described himself
as a socialist while very much
being a supporter of Tony Blair's
style and policies.
One of the more impressive
of the Labour Club's guests, he
very capably fended off questions
from Consoc members especially
over local government. After one
question he particularly empha-
sised that Conservative run
Westminster Council is the only
one in the country which has
been officially found corrupt, and
the council appointed solicitors
who refute these allegations are
hardly 'independent'.
Motor Show Protest
Traffic around Earl's Court was
disrupted twice over the week-
end as people demonstrated out-
side the London Motor Show.
Security guards and Police were
called in to restrain protesters as
they tried to clamber over the
barriers surrounding the building.
Last Friday evening saw
'Critical Mass', a cyclist pressure
group, arriving at the Show for a
rally after their monthly meet
under Waterloo bridge. The
group of about a thousand
cyclists proceeded slowly to the
Brompton Road entrance of the
show. There they were confront-
ed by locked gates and irate secu-
rity guards. Along the route of
their ride, the flow of traffic,
already fairly stagnant in the rush
hour, ground to a halt with
motorists venting their irritation
by sounding their horns.
One driver tried to force
hisway through the crowd of
bicycles but was advised by a
Police Officer to stay put, much
to the delight of the assembled
masses. The cyclists were keen to
stress the peaceful nature of their
protest, aimed at demonstrating
the hypocrisy of motoring in
London.
One individual expressed a
desire "to spread love and peace"
throughout the capital by "wav-
ing and smiling at people" as they
passed.
Sunday had the 'Reclaim the
Streets Action Network' out in
force opposite the Warwick Road
entrance to Earl's Court. It was a
much smaller demonstration
than Friday's but more vocal;
chanting slogans and cheering
each bus and booing each car that
passed.
The protesters generated a
lot of noise but were mainly inef-
fectual in disrupting the flow of
visitors to the show. At one point
they tried to bring their own
Chinese Dragon style model
London Bus on to the road, but
were forcibly prevented from
doing so by a ring of Police.
