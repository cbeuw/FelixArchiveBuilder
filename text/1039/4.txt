Council Elections
will be Re-run
One of the shortest Emergency
Councils on record met on
Tuesday night to consider a
motion put forward by the
Executive Committee "that
Council nullify the elections of
ordinary members that took
place at its meeting on 10th
October and that new elections
should take place." The motion
was supported by a handout dis-
tributed by those most incensed
by the original election's 'uncon-
stitutionality'.
A bone of contention was
whether or not the proposing
papers for ordinary members
should have gone up for two
weeks prior to the elections. This
would have made all Union
members aware of the forthcom-
ing elections, so they could stand
if they so wished. However, it
was established at the meeting
that the constitution is ambigu-
ous on this point, and that many
interpretations could have been
made.
Points were raised over the
practicality of running the elec-
tions again, and the principle of
having open elections not exclu-
sive to those in the know. Sarah
White said that the motion was
meant to address peoples' feel-
ings over the first elections, and
that, if passed, the papers for the
posts would go up the day after.
The debate continued for twenty
minutes before being called to a
vote by the Council Chair, and
the motion was passed by 12
votes to 9, there being 31 voting
members present.
Oxfam Cash Stolen
in Raid on Rag
BY THE NEWS TEAM
An estimated Â£300 of rag
fundraisihg for Oxfam was stolen
from the ICU building last
Wednesday. Rag collectors had
spent Wednesday afternoon in
Embankment station, and had
left the profits in the rag office
on the west side of Beit Quad
overnight. The proceeds from a
collection in aid of Oxfam went
missing sometime after 7pm. IC
Security discovered that the win-
dow had been removed whilst
patrolling later that evening, but
the loss of money was only dis-
covered the next morning.
Speaking on behalf of the
Rag committee, Eleanor Tench
speculated that the perpetrators
were IC students with some
knowledge of the union building
as the charity collection buckets
were later found in the union
changing rooms. "I don't under-
stand the mentality of someone
who would steal from charity"
she said. "Freshers have got up at
six o'clock in the morning to col-
lect, and some bastard's got the
proceeds in their pocket... we're
very very angry."
John Lambert, currently Rag
treasurer, is temporarily oversee-
ing the Rag committee in the
absence of an elected chair. The
previous incumbent, Richard
Willis, resigned last month after
being criticised when a first year
student was found drunk on the
walkway after the rag fresher's
event.
