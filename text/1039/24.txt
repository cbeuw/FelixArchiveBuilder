TWENTY-FOUR . FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 3RD 1 995 LETTERS
LETTERS TO FELIX: REPLIED T O THIS WEEK BY ALEX FEAKES
H a m and

Dear Ed,
I would like to appeal to any ICU
member interested in ham radio.
The Union's amateur radio club,
Hamsoc, is currently inactive and
needs keen members (especially
licence holders) to get it up and
running once more.
The club owns Â£15,000 of
equipment and has been allocat-
ed a budget for the coming acad-
emic year. If anyone is interested
in either running or joining the
club, could they please drop me a
line via the RCC Exec, pigeon
holes in the Union office.
Yours etc.
Robert Lea,
RCC Chairman.
Dear Sir or Madam,
It's all
Greek to me
This is in reply to last week's let-
ter by Mr Daniel Figueras-Niets.
Since I cannot comment on any-
thing said in council meeting that
Daniel refers to (I was not pre-
sent) this is aimed at anyone who
thinks that overseas students are
inactive in Union matters.
37% of the college's student
population is of non-British origin
('overseas students'). This per-
centage puts Imperial among the
most multicultural academic
institutions in the world.
After twelve months of the
work in the Union as the OSC
Chairman last year, I can safely
say that overseas students con-
tribute much to the Union's life
both through the overseas soci-
eties and the rest of Clubs and
Societies. 'International Night' is
the largest student organised
event of ICU. It is not, however,
the case that overseas societies
organise events for the sake of
overseas societies alone. Just
check the article in this week's
issue by the Hellenic Society and
all this comes into context.
To conclude, it's the 'ancient
curse' of our college that IC stu-
dents don't really get involved
with IC matters; but of those few
that do, at least 37% are overseas.
Sincerely Yours,
Andreas Mershin.
OSC Chairman 1994/95,
Physics Ac Rep 95/96.
It is a shame that your letter
quickly slides into being an
advert for O S C events rather
than taking the opportunity to
answer the letter and the issue.
Dear Felix,
I was concerned and quite
frankly amazed to read the inac-
curate comments Mr. Figueras
Niets attributed to me in last
weeks Felix. Not surprisingly he
seems unable to remember the
half of what was said some three
weeks after the event. As a result
I feel obliged to explain exactly
what I said and in what context.
At the council meeting in
question I was outlining how
Imperial College is fundamental-
ly different from other British
Universities. At one point I
explained how Imperial has;
"Many foreign students as well as
students on 9 to 5 courses who
then don't give a shit about the
Union.... They are here only to
get a degree." I never once
accused 'foreigners' exclusively
but merely highlighted why many
of Imperial's members, British or
otherwise, are so apathetic
towards their Union.
I find it only natural that stu-
dents faced with high academic
work loads are not wholly enthu-
siastic at the idea of working for
the Union in their spare time.
Indeed the demands placed upon
a student studying in a language
other than their own seem truly
horrific. However I would like to
take this opportunity to detail
the reality of student representa-
tion at iCU.
There at present some 2639
foreign nationals studying at
College making up 36.5 % of
Imperial's student body. Out of
the 52 officers involved in the
running of Union activities only 5
are from overseas. In fact even
the Overseas Clubs Committee
Chairman is himself British! The
quality of Imperial is largely due
to the quality of it's overseas stu-
dents but it is quite clear there is
considerable shortfall in their
involvement in running Non-
Academic matters.
I am sorry Mr Figueras-Niets
'felt undignified' [sic], but I
would appreciate it if he could in
future check his facts before por-
traying me as some un-informed
racial bigot. In short, I apologise
to all Overseas students for Mr
FN's misinterpretation of my
comments but I feel I have no
reason to apologise for what I
actually said and what I believe.
Yours Sincerely,
Tim Townend, DP(Clubs and
Societies).
Thank you for allowing us a
glimpse into the Union's book of
records, but what was actually
said or the backgrounds of the
students referred to fades in
importance against the perceived
attitudes of the students, their
Union and their Sabbaticals.
Students will only get involved
in activities and events that
interest or cater for them, so to
complain that people do not get
involved is more an expression of
the fact that you cannot be all
things to all people.
Opportunities are there for all to
get involved: Imperial's multi-
cultural nature is a strength,
allowing exposure for students
to other cultures.
Letters may be
commented on by a guest
editor whose
opinions are not
necessarily those of the editor.
Deadline for letters:
6pm Monday.
Please bring your union
card for
identification.
