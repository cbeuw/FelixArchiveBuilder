Society
The Hellenic society is a national society
organised by Greek IC students, and its

We also hope to make all these forms of
Greek Culture more widely known, while at
the same time educate ourselves in the
cultures of other countries. In short, we want
to make more friends.
The highlight of this term's events is the
first 'Greek Evening' of the year which will
take place in the Main Dining Hall of the
Sherfield on the 1st of December with Greek
food, wine and live music until the early
hours. Then comes the 'Electroacoustic
Acroasis', a live music event in the union
lounge where student bands from IC and
other universities can come and play. We
hope to get a wide variety of styles from
traditional greek all the way to heavy metal,
via jazz and indie.
We also invite big names from the
domain of science, culture, economics and
politics to give lectures.
Apart from socialising, we also feel that
as a large Society of IC we have the obligation
to strive towards the common good. We have
therefore decided to bring up an issue that we
attach great importance to, namely excessive
poster abuse or poster pollution, as we put it.
1. Although posters are necessary, the
amount of posters that are up at the moment
is excessive and very often posters are placed
on no-poster areas.
2. More posters means less trees.
3. More posters means less effective posters
since no-one reads them.
4. Clubs are spending a considerable amount
of money on posters, which could be used
more constructively.
To set an example the Hellenic Society
hereby undertakes to put no more than three
posters per event in the designated poster
area, and to take them down properly once
they expire.
