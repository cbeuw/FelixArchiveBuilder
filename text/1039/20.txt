RCS Union General Meeting
(UGM)
Friday 3rd Nov. - Ents Lounge - lpm prompt.
The following posts are up for grabs:
Ents. Chair I Asst. Hon. Sec. I Clubs Cttee Chair
Broadsheet Asst. Ed. - ( has to be a fresher ) / Publicity Officer
Asst. A AO I Handbook Ed. I RCSARep. I Archivist.
Ents. Chair - Not really looking for a chairperson ( unless they really want to ) but for a solid
core of motivated, serious but fun-loving people who can organise events.
Asst. Hon. Sec - If you want to know more about the union's goings on then this is an ideal
position. You minute meetings and help the Hon. Sees throughout the year.
The above two posts will probably be involved in helping organise the Annual Dinner.
Clubs Cttee Chair - Will coordinate the RCS Clubs & Societies and help revive lost ones.
Broadsheet Asst. Ed. - Has to be a fresher - Will help write articles - although there's nothing
stopping anybody else from contributing to our publication - gather articles, and
help collate Broadsheet.
Asst. AAO - Will sit on Accademic affairs meetings also shadowing the A A O , and will also be
the Bookshop Rep.
Handbook Ed. - With the help of the Broadsheet Team, will look for advertising sponsors and
write next years Freshers' Handbook ( Archivist will also help out here.)
RCS A Rep. - Will liaise with the Ex. Students Association, representing the current students.
Archivist - College life can be quite hectic and we need to keep tabs on it. Everyday becomes
a new page in history and you'll have to maintain a reference/filing system for
the future.
Publicity Officer - The RCS is only as good as how well events are publicised; a motivated and
imaginative person is required to make sure the other students know what's
going on.
