FELIX EDITORIAL BOARD
This a r t i c l e i s , I f e e l , j u s t i f i e d on the
grounds that many readers do not know who
produce the d r i v e l they buy once a fortnight.
Also, i t i s t r a d i t i o n a l that an Editor, as his
Editorship draws to a close, should write this
P r o f i l e . So, i f you are not already sick of
F e l i x blowing his own trumpet i n this issue,
catalogued below you w i l l find those f o r whose
presence on the E d i t o r i a l Board I am most
grateful. May 1 put i n a word of thanks to our
other helpers and sales s t a f f also ? Felix
is very grateful f o r , and most proud to have,
their assistance.
Sub-Editors: Chris Farrow, senior sub-editor,
is a product of R.C.E. Chemistry and now i s a
l s t . y r . p.g. i n Mines. I t i s he,who, with
snooping nose and bleary eye, seeks out the
items he pens i n Nelson's Column.
Peter Palmer i s a very c i v i l engineer and
also a f i r s t year p.g. - having been away for
the l a s t two years i n industry. He i s one of
the less vociferous members of the board and
is responsible for the Coming Events Column
and many of our"bread and butter" reports.
Secretary: Elizabeth Kranck, blondelCWArian
p.g. i n Geochemistry, i s a Finnish-Canadian.
She deals e f f i c i e n t l y with the mass of secret-
a r i a l work and also helps out with the typing
of the paper.
Business Manager:(Treasurer): Ian Plummer, of
Mining I I , i s the man who restrains the wild
spending sprees of the editors. Apart from a l l
this non-creative work, he i s an active report-
er and producer of a r t i c l e s .
Production Manager: Peter Levin (not to be
confused with P.L. Levine) sees to the layout
of the material on the 'master copy' of the
paper. When he i s not doing t h i s , he i s purs-
uing his academic interests: Physics III and
sex.

With his assistant, Pete Brazier, who types
the reports, John produces tbe sports pages
in half the time everybody else takes to make
up the remainder of the paper.
Art Editor: Pat Billingham i s i n Aero.II. He
is a t y p i c a l bearded-artist-cum-goon-type-

able to restrain him - blup.
Photographic Editor: Fred 'Peanuts' Peacock,
Chern. Eng. p.g., slaves f o r hours on end i n
the dark-room yet finds time to write us a r t -
i c l e s . Fred has done a l o t of work to t r y
and improve the standard of reproduction of
photos i n Felix and this i s already producing
effective results.
There then i s the Board. We work as a team
in which nobody should be picked out f o r espec-
i a l praise. J.7.B.

"Proceeding down Exhibition Road, we come to
the Charming group of Lowther Gardens, two red
brick buildings by Mr. J . J . Stevenson. Next i s

What are the guilds of London ? The I n s t i t u t e ,
apart from i t s situation, f o r i t ought to be
in the City, and i t s absurd name, w i l l prove
a great boon to the working man when i t s ad-
vantages and objects are known; but i t i s too
many miles from the dwellings of those for
whom i t i s intended. The building i s dark red
brick with carvings i n l i g h t e r brick, and has
no merits that can be mentioned, unless per-
haps that i t i s convenient for i t s purpose.
The India Museum and other collections f i l l
the g a l l e r i e s adjoining the old Royal Hortic-
u l t u r a l Society's gardens. They present no
feature of architectural or h i s t o r i c interest
as buildings. A new road and new buildings
are to be made across part of the s i t e for
the Imperial I n s t i t u t e . So far as plans have
been made public they seem to r i v a l even the
c i t y i n s t i t u t e i n i t s ugliness, and to form a
mean between that and Mr. Waterhouse's s t i l l
more unfortunate Natural History Museum with
which, to borrow a heraldic term, the build-
ing w i l l be 'addorsed'."

emorates, the departure from I.C. of Douglas M. Gilbey
after a period as a P.G., during whioh, lik,e most P.Gls,
he was more remarkable for soaringrtheoretical aspirat-
ions than for mere practical achievement; for perpetual
sleeping-and-waxing preoccupaticn with his research
than for irreproachable timekeeping; far good fel+irr-
ship than far efficiency. May his talents flourish under
Government Service. His like are to be found in all re-
search laboratories, and of them, as of him, this poem
is an appreciation and a memorial.
Elegy Written in a Chemistry Laboratory
There's the bench where Gilbey, many years ago
Watched the moonbeams creeping o'er the C.R.0.
Watohed the dawn's faint whisper fade to evening's blur,
Watched the moon slide up the sky, and s t i l l he did not
stir.
There's the bench where Gilbey (lads, i t makes me weep)
Passed the days in slumber and the nights in sleep,
There's the chair he sat an when his work was dene.
Where's the apparatus? Lad, there wasn't one.
There's the Roy. Soo. Paper: it's unfinished yet.
There's the heap of crosswords that helped him to forget;
There's his coffee beaker, damp and thick with slime,
S t i l l unwashed as ever (never had the time).
When the work is done, Tads, when the lamps are low,
When the dawn's faint promise fades to evening's glow,
When the apparatus is in a steady state,
That's when Gilbey's ghost comes, twenty minutes late.
Then the ghost of Gilbey rustles through the room,
Lights along the benches, whispers in the gloom
Ponderous dilemmas, deepest ever set:
There's no doubt about i t , Gilbey's with us yet.
