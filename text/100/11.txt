The continued use of imprecise titles applied to
'OBUvres des chefs' should not be tolerated by the
technically enlightened gastronome. Something more
revealing than the name of an European city or Channel
port is required when ordering a meal from the menu.
There has long been a tendenoy to link culinary
skill with science, domestic or otherwise, whereas
formerly i t rated with art or witchcraft, depending
on i t s effects. (Ref. Guide to Gluttony for Gourmets,
Fritter and Schnitzel, vol. Z, sold in U.S.A. only).
Now that cookery is a reoognised science i t should
not be difficult to lay down satisfactory Board of
Trade type specifications.
What i3 the difference between a Vienna steak
Milanaise and a Milan Steak Viennoise? None in name,
but a worl4 of difference when one is grilled by a
grimy Serb in Soho and the other by a temperamental
Chinaman in Bombay; one might resemble Corned Beef
and dog biscuits for the Trans-Antarctic Expedition
One dish consistent on this side of the Atlantic is
the Frankfurter Steak, that delectable pulverised
meat(?) carbonised briokette. Trans the Atlantio,
Frank signifies a Hot Dog, anything hot is Jam, and
in no time we are round to the rooks and rolls.
Enough — letfe have a ooncrate polioy for food.

Mr. Peter Rowe brought to our notice the
following l e t t e r which appeared i n "THE LIS-
TENER" on Aug. 2nd.s-
"....In southern Sweden some time ago I v i s -
i t e d the only rubber cowshed i n the world.
Here 150 cows l i v e d i n a building where the
floors and walls were lined with rubber,
c a r e f u l l y designed to keep the animals com-
fortable without the use of straw, and allow
easy and thorough cleansing. The cows were
not allowed to graze i n the f i e l d s as that
would have trampled down too much fodder,
but the grass was cut and brought to the
cowshed by l o r r y , and a small e l e c t r i c over-
head railway carried round the shed, appropr-
i a t e quantities being dropped i n front of the
animals. Behind the s t a l l s ran a continuous
rubber-lined trough which received the by-
products of bovine metabolism, to be collected
and stored i n a vast underground tank beneath
the shed and i n due course pumped back on to
the f i e l d s .
To prevent contamination from this trough
each eowte t a i l wss attached by means of a
spring-loaded wire to an overhead hook so
that when the animal l a y down on i t s rubber
bed, i t s t a i l was hoisted clear of the ground.
To make certain that the products of bovine
metabolism reached the trough, a metal rod
was suspended horizontally i n each s t s l l and
adjusted to the height of i t s occupant. I f the
cow's shoulders were too f a r forward when
about to defecate, the rod was touched, the
animal received an e l e c t r i c shock and moved
backwards to the correct'dropping point'.
In this way, and with a very small labour
force, the dairy farmer, an enterprising
Swedish i n d u s t r i a l i s t , had succeeded i n pro-
ducing milk that was almost germ free, although
I believe i t was then sent from the farm to
the l o c a l co-operative dairy where I t was mixed
with infected milk from 'normal' farms and
pasteurised.
Yours etc.,

Although the Ministries of Food and Health
have rigid standards, there are certain new testa
not usually applied.
For example, dense medium separation to
segregate good peas from those with animal assoc-
iations; the ease of impaling peas on forks is
dependent on their coefficient of restitution,
surface hardness and surfaoa oharge. No equation
to relate these three factors has yet been
released to the learned journals.
Few realise the hazards of eating radishes.
Apart from the prescence of occluded gas, the skin
can have considerable radioactivity. The aphrodisiac
content of lettuce can have lusting effects on those
who habitually eat salad. The Monroe test can be
applied to addicts to determine the extent of
their downfall.
Remember when you lie groaning after your
excess of Yuletide gluttony - you should have
calculated the vitamin content first.
