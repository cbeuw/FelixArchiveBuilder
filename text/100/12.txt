Newspapers often remind UK of the strain
imposed by rush-hour travel on London Transport
but personally I find tube journeys stimulating
to the mind. Coming to S.Ken. from Putney the
other day, my train, bound for Mansion House,
Pulled in at Earl's Court Station. Here I was
quick to observe an Upminster train on the
opposite side of the platform. Now, being a
clever sort of a bloke, I waited i n my Mansion
House train until I saw the signal light for
the other train turn to green. I then dashed
across the platform, having deduced from obs-
ervations on previous occasions that the Up-
minster train would then go off f i r s t .
However, even the sharpest of us - and as
I say, I'm quite a clever chap myself, are
liable to s l i p up and on this occasion some
contrary l i t t l e man at the back of the train
shut the doors sharpish like, so that, as I
was proceeding with considerable forward mom-
entum, I was obliged to leave my teethmarks
on the door paintwork. Keeling my loose incis-
ors I turned round ruefully and was suddenly
conscious of a second green light ln!
the cor-
ner of my eye and the doors of the Mansion
House train were sliding to.
Uomentarily frustrated, I swore. I decided
to cut my losses and take the Piccadilly Line,
to S. iCen. Now, escalators are dashed delight-
ful diverse devicesf for not only do they save
poor old ladies from walking upstairs but by
virtue of their adverts, they provide amuse-
ment (and a certain amount of stimulation) for
young chaps like me. (Incidentally i t is grat-
ifying to note that dog owners are required
t o carry their pets so that they can look at
the pictures and so learn about the facts of
human l i f e . )
The advert, by U-SS BK-S. attracted my att-
ention. These gentlemen try to give you the
idea that their hired evening suits will some-
how give you confidence i f you are obliged to
give a speech at some formal gathering. But a
clever chap like me can see through them. It
is not really their evening dress which gives
the chap in the advert, confidence, he's got
his twin brother s i t t i n g on one side of him
and his elder brother on the other. The waiter
looks as though he could be his second cousin
too.

I packed myself into the train which shortly
arrived, and had a look round to see i f there
was anything worth looking at apart from my
reflection. It's a queer thing in trains, every-
body has got to look some-where but is deter-
mined not to look at anyone else. I only wish
people like Marks and Censors and others would
follow the lead of Messrs. Shackles and Lockup
foj- surely they have a duty to .amuse us in7
the
otherwise wasted time spent travelling.
In conclusion I would like to say,
Just watch when next you go that way,
And sure enough you're bound to find
The e c c e n t r i c i t i e s of mankind,
And i f perchance you find elsewhere,
Some other quirks and fancies thÂ«ire
Just l e t us know, in prose or v e r s e
For what we print could not be worse.
Fritz.
