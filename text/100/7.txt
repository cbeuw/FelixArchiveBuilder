F e l i x the Cat has now romped through Imp-
e r i a l College f o r seven years. He has remain-
ed e s s e n t i a l l y the earns since his b i r t h on
the 9th, of .December 1949 when the f i r s t E d i t -
or, S.U. Hughes, announced i n Issue No. 1:
"the need has been f e l t for some time f o r
a frequently p u b l i s h e d journal to comment
upon the a f f a i r s of t h e College whilst they
are s t i l J t o p i c a l , and to bring to the atten-
tion of its:' members the a c t i v i t i e s of Clubs
and Societies of which people at present know
i i t t l ' i , and knowing l i t t l e , tend to care even
l e s s . This I F a function which c l e a r l y can-
not be performed by THE PHOENIX, p a r t i c u l a r l y
sirvcis that estimable bird ie now to appear
only twice a year, and eo FELIX has come to
meet the need. We do not Intend to be com-
plementary to that journal, sven i f not always
complimentary. Neither are we i n any way
connected with i t , nor are we i t s offspring,
(in any case, this unfortunate bird i s pre-
sumably unable to produce any offspring,
since only one bird exists at any one time,
r i s i n g from the ashes of i t s predecessor.
Perhaps this Recounts f o r i t s doleful appear-
ance). No, THE PHOENIX w i l l remain an
essentially l i t e r a r y magazine, whereas we
s h a l l content ourselves with providing a
commentary upon events and personalities."
Mr. Hughes then went on to says"The success
or f a i l u r e of this paper depends p r i n c i p a l l y
upon you, our readers. In the f i r s t place we
depend upon you to produce many of our a r t i c l e s
and reports, since our s t n f f cannot themmlnes
attend and report every College <*vent. Second-
l y . ....... l i v e l y correspondence a i r your
opinions...... T h i r d l y buy your own copy
" - a l l of which s t i l l holds.
The 10th. issue appeared i n the now familia
s t y l e . Only four pages, the reduced s i z e of
type enabled the inclusion of the same amoum
of subject matter as before. This was the C&rs
Freshers' Issue and contained the map of South
Kensington l a s t reproduced i n No. 95 (with
modifications) The next issue had s i x pages,'
which became the usual s i z e upto Issue 94. I t
was notable for " F e l i x Hoad Test No. 1 - The
1926 Morris Cow]ey."
And so we could go on; picking gems from
each F e l i x . Regretably space does not allow
t h i s . Beginning to f l i p through the f l i c s i n -
stead, one notices that No.17 was printed on
buff paper. Successive editions were pink, blu
mauve, white and then buff. That experiment
stertad and ended for no apparent reason. The
impression one gets from .tha e a r l i e r iesues i e
that the college was more •alive' then than
now. The Influence of the fact that a large
proportion of the undergraduates were mature
ex-servicemen i r reflected i n the columns.
Humour i n F e l i x war more adult - which I F to
be expected. Thlr was but a phase in the pap-
er's evolution - a modification to the under-
l y i n g lightheadedness of s p i r i t which has
remained essentially the pane since 1949.
This S p i r i t of Felix i s always evident.
Some Editors produced "stodgy" issues, pome
were very frivolous. But I.C. news and views
have always boen f a i t h f u l l y recordod and the
paper has always spoken i t n mind. The f P i r i t
has b«.»n passed on by miecesalve E d i t o r i a l
