LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
I.C. Union,
Dep. 8th.
Dear Sir,
Your reference to the number of I 0 W A rians
supporting their hop on Nov. 17th was 50 per oent
in error. 12 members of the Association were there.
This relatively small number is due to the lack of
support from the freshers at present. Ife hope that
when they settle down, they will devote more time
to the activities within their own Association.
Incidentally, i f the President had forbidden
fraternisation within the college, the numbers of
ICWArian3 at the danoe might have been doubled.
I ' l l try i t some time.
Tours correctively,
Wendy D.S. Pipe,
President of ICWA.

Dear S i r ,
My attention has been drawn to the fact
that i t i s planned to include i n the new I.C.
Union building a room of considerable dimen-
sions whose sole purpose i s the sale of intox-
icating liquors, and the singing of songs of
a nature such that most members of the College
are rightly shocked by the low moral standards
displayed by the drunken participants.
I t i s well known that the incidence of
drunkenness i n the younger generation i s incr-
easing, and the corresponding decline in moral
standards i s , I am sure, d
u
-
;
> to the d i s g u s t i n g
habit of some students (fortunately few) drink
lng themselves insensible on every passible
occasion.
Is i t not too late to nave the plans a l -
tered and convert this room to some more use-
ful purpose such as for communal hymn singing,
or i f this i s impossible to limit the liquids
sold to those of a beneficial nature such as
milk and orange juice.
Yours etc.,

Dear Sir,
In the report on General Studies whioh
appears in the last issue of Felix, i t is stated
that the leoture, "A British Cossunist looks at

This was not so.
I should like to point out that the 3oo. Soo.
does not give platform to Corammist Party speakors
except in content of general meetings of Socialists.
The Socialist Sooiety consists of these of
left-wing views, whether they are mild or extreme.
I hope this mistake does not occur again.
Yours sincerely,

club exhibition
cPovertu Of ^path^
Of the fifteen works on show at the Annual
Exhibition of the I.C. Art Club only six are
by students of the College.
Whilst being grateful to those who so gal-
lantly suscrlbe works to keep the Art Club
Exhibitions going, we think It A VERY POOR
EFFORT on the part of the STUDENT BODY that
only FOUR students out of a round number of
TUP THOUSAND could find sufficient interest In
the Art Club to submit work.
The exhibition was worthy of a v i s i t , how-
ever, and there were some interesting works.
Special mention should be made of the works of
the President of the Club, S i r Alfred Bgerton.
They truly reflect the happiness which paint-
ing, as a hobby, can give.
One cannot help feeling, though, on looking
at one or two of the exhibits, that i t i s not
so much the standard or quality of the product
which gives the pleasure, although this of
course contributes, but the fun that can be
had out of producing i t .
