The dance in celebration of FELIX's seventh
birthday was held on December lst., when we were
pleased to be able to welcome representatives of
other London University newspapers, including
the Editor of SENNET, Miss Elizabeth Harrison.
The guests ruined their alimentary oanals with
some fire-water euphemistically called "punch"
and when the alcohol reached t h e i r feet, went
off to join the dancers. A presentation to Miss
Harrison solved the mystery of the BLUP, when
she was given a water-filled balloon with
instructions to drop i t out of the window. This
she did- missing Kitch by inches and sending
our resident photographer crazy because he hadn't
his carnera ready.
Just before the f i l m show, the Editor and
Vitch retired'(to the bar, of course) t o judge
the limerick competition; two of the winning
entries Eire printed below. As usual with FELIX
f i l m shows, the comments of the eudience were as
funny as the films. We seemed t o have an entire
Goon Show at the back. (Shut up, ScclesJ)
Although the evening wore an, the dancers d i d
not seem to wear out, and a session of Rock 'n'
R o l l was held to satisfy the more energetic. Just
before 11.0pm. the band played the last waltz,
followed by half of "God Save the >iueen".
Fortunately, the evening was remarkably free
from incidents. Only one gentleman(?) t r i e d to
persuade us he was drunk- we didn't believe him.
Most people seemed to have enjoyed themselves -
we certainly did.
Limerick Competition:
Winning entry i n the 'printable' section:

Hot breaths and loud groans
And maidens' hysterical screams.
Runner-up:
There was a young student of Rheims
Who had the most Freudian dreams
He became quite frustrated
' T i l his Bgo was mated
- And now he's found out what
"Id" means.

Notman (Room 97, New Hostel), and the runner
-up by (Miss?) M.A. Stripp of Canterbury H a l l .
The winner i n the 'unprintable' section was

Gflfje Jftrsft Vacation
In a few days' time many of this year's
freshers, now a l i t t l e s t a l e r , w i l l be return-
ing home after t h e i r f i r s t prolonged break
from home l i f e . Their f i r s t days at college
were doubtless marked on the one hand by the
usual sermons on the need to give one's utmost
i n one's academic studies, and on the other
hand by the f r a n t i c attempts by the club o f f i c -
i a l s to shepherd them into their own p a r t i c u l a r
f o l d . After'this onslaught they w i l l be l e f t
i n no doubt that a f u l l college l i f e demands
that you work hard and play hard.
"Work hard and play hard." - i s indeed a
good slogan f o r a successful college l i f e and
l a t e r they may consider this year, spent learn-
ing to l i v e at this hectic pace, was not used
to i t s best advantage. For students away fronri
home there i s always a tendency f o r the c o l l -
ege to become the be a l l and end a l l of l i f e ;
they work there, they play there and their
friends belong there. As time goes on they
w i l l find that one way or another the college
w i l l demand more and more time of them, with
course work and carnivals, general studies and
s o c i a l studies i n the bar, not forgetting hops
and more a t h l e t i c types of sport on a Saturday.
Such i s college l i f e . In the years to come
we w i l l look back on i t , and i t may seem unreal
to us - f o r i t i s unreal. We are learning how
to make the most of our l i v e s i n an environment
offering opportunities galore to broaden our
minds and extend our range of a c t i v i t i e s , though
this i s overshadowed by a sense of urgency,
competition and insecurity. The people i n our
everyday l i v e s are students and there i s an
unconscious tendency for us to regard them as
typical young men and women, and to regard our
college l i f e to be a natural one. This i s not
the case and hence nobody should underestimate
the value of those periods when we are back at
home or working i n industry, for i t i s then
that we are l i v i n g a more normal l i f e among
everyday people. I t i s then that we realise
that l i f e i s not always l i k e i t i s at college
and we can take the opportunity for relaxation
i n readiness f o r the next term.
But I do not for a moment suggest that i n
the years to come we should content ourselves
with the humdrum existence which many others
l i v e - I do not think that many ex-students
would be able to. They should l i v e a f u l l and
active l i f e , but without that hectic uncert-
ainty which one finds at college.
For myself, I r e a l l y enjoy college l i f e
but thank God for the vacs 1

Scraps
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's
wife,
His ox thou shalt not slaughter;
But thank the l o r d i t does not say,
Thou shalt not squeeze his daughter.
I bet adults in adultery have far more
fun than infants i n infancy.
