HALL DINNER - ITS PURPOSE ?
Kail Dinner was instituted a few years ago
with the object of providing staff and students
with an opportunity to meet informally at a
socifll function. A subsidiary purpose was to
give people a suitable chance to entertain
guests in their college. These aims (especially
the f i r s t ) were considered worthy of a hand-
some subsidy in order to encourage people to
s<ttend.
One might expect from the rapid bookings
for Hall Dinners that tnese aims are being
amply f u l f i l l e d . A more thorough investigHt-
lon shows that this i s by no means the case,
fome recent Hall Dinners have reduced the
alleged objects to a farce. On December 11th.
Hall dinner was arranged early so that diners
could go on to the play. In other words, a
oheup meal for those going to the play. Any-
one wanting to go to Hall Dinner i n the usual
way was swamped out. There seems to be no
justification for subsidising such a function
as this, and even less justification anyway
for perverting an alleged Hall Dinner out of
a l l recognition.
Eome weeks ago the Chemical Engineering
Department presented some silver to the c o l l -
ege at a Hall Dinner. This Dinner, too, was
booked out in record time, almost entirely by
members of the Chem. Eng. Department. This
was,in fact, a Departmental occasion marked by
ceremonies and speeches which could have been
a pleasant addition to the Chemical Engineering
Society's dinner a few weeks later but were
wholly out of place at Hall Dinner, which was
not really a Hall Dinner at a l l .
Block bookings by large groups within the
college were BAMIXD at the last Union meeting
by an overwhelming majority. Block bookings,
of, for instance, a group old boys from a
certain school means simply that the college
is subsidising an Old Boys' reunion, and an
end to these block bookings should certainly
give more people a chance and lend more sig-
nificance to the true purpose of the function.
Unfortunately block bookings in consider-
able numbers seem to be the order of the day
among the staff. Gone ore the days when prof6.
took i t i n turns to take the chair. In fact
the character of Hall Dinner has become that
of an o f f i c i a l college dinner at which studentts
provide s pleasant chattering background to
the entertainment of o f f i c i a l college guests.
Some members of staff valiantly entertain their
tutorial groups or other students and sometimes
members of staff are invited by students. THAT
is the true s p i r i t of Hall Dinner, but this
w i l l never be completely recaptured until
the Dinner i s held for i t s own sake and not
perverted into an"official college dinner",
or into special occasions interesting only
a fraction of the community. - Food for
thought for the Hall Dinner committee.

Long ago the men of Mbrella
Broke the land beneath the plough,
Knew the ways that win the day:.
How to make the sombre yew
Yield the strong and supple bow.
Then the noble
Through the wo
Passed a glad -,j
And from years
Hose a richer \
.
Then did a l l the men of Mbrella
Know the secrets of the hollow
And the wanders of the wood:
How to tend the fruitless fallow,
How to guide the b.\ sting billow.

"Yet ire need our Morons too.
Back room Mbrella, to ; our benches!

(Half aside) "You wretched crew!"
Still the muddled sons of Mbrella
Passed idyllic days at school.
Idle 30ng and useless tongue
Still distinguished sage from fool.
Yet they learned one golden Rule ...
"Keep the backroom boys on tap
But never let them top the tree,
Then the men with nimble finder
Turned in silence to the sea.
How could any bear tc jt.w?
