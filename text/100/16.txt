The l s t . XV having emerged from i t s early
oubles is now settling down well and the past
w matches have at times produced some very
od rugby. The 2nd. XV continues to maintain
high standard and the reserve strength of the
ub i s shown by the consistent success of the
»er sides.
IC revenged to some extent their earlier*
eat in the University Cup when they beat UC
two goals and a penalty goal to a try. The
pack showing more s p i r i t had the measure of
opposition and the backs made much of their
ices. Against the Old M i l l h i l l i a n s second
i an the following Sat. the team played well
,ether. The f i n a l score being 24 pts. to n i l
•ur favour.
Wye College who are always welcome visitors
i ffored a f a i r l y heavy defeat when they were
aten by a goal six tries and a dropped goal
a penalty goal. King a fresher to the Colleg
to be congratulated on scoring.five tries.
A last minute change in fixture allowed the
t. XV to travel to Maidenhead to play Thames
lley. This proved a very fine fixture both
and off the f i e l d . IC were pressing for 80%
the game but a very solid defence coupled
th poor IC finishing prevented a try being
ored. Furthermore the home side seized both
portunities that were presented to them and
reply to their two goals Stone kicked a
nalty goal. This defeat at the hands of quite
strong team should brush away the complacency
at semms to have developed after a number of
jy wins.

I.C. WINS U.L. CROSS COUNTRY
CHAMPIONSHIPS
After a two year reign by U.C. the University
Championship Cup returned to IC. for the seventh
time since the war. The Individual winner was
again John Evans (IC) in a-record time of 26m 24s
for the muddy h i l l y 5£ mile course at Parliament
H i l l . He was followed home, over a minute latter
b y K . G l l l l g a n (UC) and M.Batty (LSE).
Imperial can be proud of the fact that four
of the 17 teams finishing the course came from
this college. At one stage of the race IC hopes
f e l l when It became apparent that D.Brigga, a
regular UL l s t . team man, was suffering from a
recurrent foot Injury. However the rest of the
team, J.Collins 6th., K.Wall 10th., M.Rogers 13th.
D.Webster 14th., assured us of victory.
The 2nd. team, C.Wood, D.Thomas, O.Fraser,
P.Rayment, C.Gravina, did well to come sixth

SAILING CLUB
IC are holding their own in the Intercolleg-
iate Winter Points Series. A cup is awarded
for the best aggregate points for 6 out o. 8
races held over the winter. SEAGOON (UC) at
Present has a clear lead but FUMBLE (IC) and
FELIX (IC) are not so far behind.
In each race 25^ pts are scored by the win-
ning boat, 24 for 2nd, 23 for 3rd etc. Por
team matches the scoring system also gives a
similar i pt. boi.us for the f i r s t boat* For
the usual 3 boat a side match the l s t . boat
gets 9\ pts., last 4 pts.,A boat retiring
receives 3 pts., and a boat disqualified
receives no points at a l l . Although the boats
are a l l the same design, two heats are always
sailed with the teams exchanging boats. In
this way neither side has the advantage of a
•lucky1
boat. This points system gives very
interesting racing as i t is possible to
secure a winning combination without actually
getting f i r s t place.
Results. On Sun. 9th. FUMBLE secured 2nd.
place in the UL points race.
Points to date (dropping one race)
SEAGOON (UC) 73$ pts.
