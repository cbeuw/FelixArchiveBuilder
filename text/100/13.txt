•e were unable to include a report off the firct
night of 'Loftur' i n this edition, beoause of the
time factor. W
e intend to review the play, together
with the national press oritioismes, next term.
However, to help those who are deciding whether
or not to go tonight or tomorrow night, w
e sent a
reporter along to the dress rehearsal cm Sunday.
This is the despatch he sent us:-
lr. the midst of builders' ehaos, I.C.B.3. wore
fr-er-tically trying'to overcome the many difficulties
that s t i l l remain before the first might of the in-
augural production on the new stage. Despite warnings
that the full complement of equipment would probably
not be ready, an ambitious three set staging was be-
ing undertaken - after months of preparation with the
theatre no more than a dream am paper, the stage
staff had a formidable task to mate the theoretical
with the practical.
A "star-studded" cast has been assembled to matoh
the ingenuity of the set-designers - some of the actors
are past members of the Society, now taking part as
members of the Camus Club, given an opporterii to
appear in this first production beoause of tU
amount of work done in past years ia plans! ;
stage and its fittings and supervising its s
e
s ier.,
The play has been ohosen beoause of the oppari-unit-
ies i t gives for demonstrating the new ©aneert Hall
anu the chance to present i t to a London audienoe for
the first time was a unique and interesting one. A
oollege production of an Icelandic play must be a
notable event.
Both the costumes and the set were designed by
timbers of the College, furthermore, the costumes were

- up by a Camus Club' member. The Society has been
-lartioularly lucky In obtaining the services of Mr.
;iarold XLigj who produced the only other produeticai
•Jf 'Loftur' in Great Britain, and working with aim
has obviously been invaluable to members of both soc-
ieties.
In oonoluslon, i t osm.truthfully be said that i t
would be well worth h i * time for Mr.. Hubert Edwin
Smith to attend this play. Even i f i t does mot enter-
tain him i t will broaden his outlook. Host people will,
ire think, enjoy this neither charming nor prowooajfciva
but powerful and enianaticr amnmplft of dramatic art.
