Immortals Stumble at Home against Kent Falcons
W
ith a lot of
new recruits
and some
veterans re-
turning for a final season,
the team looked entirely
different for our rematch
against the Falcons.
We were hoping for
a much more contested
game this time around at
our home grounds.
This time around we
weren’t suffering from
missing minibuses or
anything like that and
arrived in Harlington
with plenty of time for
changing, ironing out
last-minute game plan
adjustments and warming
up.
After the usual roster
checks and coin-toss
formalities we took the
field hot during an evenly
contested first half.
Unfortunately, a couple
of defensive lapses and
a failure to score in the
red-zone twice, once at
the one-yard line, the
other with a fumble on
a break-out pass, put us
behind early at the half.
We got back into the
game quickly, thanks in
particular to Sebastiano
“Super-Glue” Zane who
received a 60-yard TD
pass in his first ever game.
We then proceeded
to pound the two-point
conversion in with our
favourite play, the Red
Raider!
Unfortunately we
struggled to keep the
momentum up, as the
Falcons cranked up the
tempo of their offence
leaving our two-way
players (almost all our
squad) gasping for air
without the ability to get
a second of rest between
plays.
Nevertheless, congrat-
ulations to our MVPs.
The first Sebastiano
was already mentioned
previously. Tom “Hello
Cheer” Smith displayed
his usual passion and love
for hard tackles, Killian
“Spacehead” Gmyrek
in his much-anticipated
return at receiver, and
Francisco “Sick Pump”
Costa for not getting
injured so far.
With the second half of
the season approaching
quickly, we are looking
at improving even further
and changing the look of
the division by re-estab-
lishing ourselves as one of
the top Britball teams.
