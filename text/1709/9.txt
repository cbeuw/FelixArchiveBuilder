Homegrown Imperial band heads to New Cross for
single release party
I
nspired by acts such
as Alabama Shakes
and fuzz-fuelled
bands of the 90s
such as Dinosaur Jr and
My Bloody Valentine,
Candy’s Room merge
together strong rhythmic
grooves with psychedelic
textures to create a new
style of pop music.
Musicians Nathaniel
and Miles (Chemical
Engineering, 2nd year)
have been performing and
writing music since their
Year Eight days, playing
in a trio of Velvet Under-
ground fanatics. Follow-
ing years of dedication to
the craft of songwriting
and musicianship, their
sound has evolved into
their own self-described
genre of ‘Dream Soul’ – a
fusion between classic
soul and dream pop.
Now initiators of the
five-piece band Candy’s
Room, they are prepared
to take 2019 by storm.
The rest of the Candy’s
Room technicolour dream
team are Dom (Physics,
2nd year) providing lead
guitar, Will (Physics, 2nd
year) delivering sonorous
saxophone melodies, and
Finn on drums.
Their new single,
‘Hither Green’ focuses on
concepts of vulnerability,
freedom, and fidelity. It is
a celebration of the area
in which their journey as
musicians began, as well
as a look into the lives of
two residents of the area.
Written and recorded last
year, the band teamed
up with Kiwi producer
Jake Stokes to turn their
ambition of creating a
song with old-school
Motown-style string and
brass arrangements into
a reality. It was recorded
at Crown Lane Studios in
Morden and Map Studio
Cafe in Camden, with
some of the recording
happening in our very
own studios at Imperial.
We at Felix were treated
to an exclusive preview of
the track. It boasts lush in-
strumentation, with crisp,
staccato guitars dancing
over undulating basslines
and delicate synths to
create a timeless, instantly
catchy feel. Switching
from serene to sprightly
in an instant, powerful
vocals cement the single
as a melodic anthem for
the coming summer.
They have high hopes
for 2019, with plans to
release one single a month
for their growing fanbase.
They plan to branch out to
other areas of the UK to
perform and hope to get
some festival gigs booked
for the summer as well.
To celebrate the release
of their new single, they
are holding a special gig
tonight at the legendary
Amersham Arms in New
Cross. Supporting them
are the upcoming artists
Uncle Monty, The Offdays
and The Misconduct
Committee.
The show begins at
7:45pm with Candy’s
Room headlining at 10pm.
Tickets can be found
on Eventbrite for £5 in
advance or can be bought
on the door for £6.
