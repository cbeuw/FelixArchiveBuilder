Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake retains its wild heart
F
rom the superstars
of the Bolshoi
to Billy Elliot
raising money for
a bus ticket to London, the
history of the male ballet
dancer is a checkered
one- as filled with triumph
and acclaim as derision
and neglect. Few modern
stagings have carved
their place in the history
of the male ballet star, or
indeed into the form itself
as Matthew Bourne’s
Swan Lake. A punk rock
reimagining, at the time
of its first performance
it took the Tchaikovsky
scored classic and tried
to blow it up from the
inside, feathered tutus and
all. Bourne recounts that
during its first run little
girls left the performances
in tears, sobbing that their
parents had bought tickets
to the wrong Swan Lake.
Perhaps only a stranger
to the worlds of buns and
pointe shoes, as Bourne
was at the time, would’ve
dared such a thing.
Watching this revival
I was struck by how
profound a transformation
Bourne’s staging is from
the original. This is no
gimmicky gender-swap,
butashiftintone,message,
and story. I was struck too
at how similar it seemed
to Ballet Black’s Mid-
summer’s Night Dream
that was performed at The
Barbican some months
go, evidence that Bourne
has had an influence in
modern ballet that has
stood the test of time. In
Bourne’s Swan Lake we
follow a pampered but
affection-deprived Prince
as he seems to find love,
is betrayed, then finds
passion and freedom in
the unlikeliest of places.
Will Bozier is tremendous
as the Swan; bare chested,
forehead marked with
war paint, he dances with
muscularity and avian
grace. If the traditional tu-
tu-performances of Swan
Lake depict the swans
with the ethereal beauty
of Edwardian paintings,
Bourne’s swans bare their
dinosaur hearts. Some-
times ungainly, sometimes
ferocious, always other-
worldly they disrupt the
proper-ness of the palace
scenes with wildness.
Bourne’s staging has
always been hailed as
“the gay Swan Lake”,
certainly the pas-de-
deux between the Prince
(Dominic North) and the
Swan King are passionate
and tender, but it is also an
ode to the chaos of nature,
a rejection of rigid rules
and carefully observed
manners. Peppered
with pantomime-esque
humour, the staging sings
with irreverent energy, in
particular, Carrie Willis
as the The Girlfriend is
scene-stealingly good.
If casting the Swan
Queen and her cast of
swans as male dancers
was a challenge in the
90s then maintaining that
sense of revolution and
drama, nearly twenty
years later as the now
classic returns to Sadler’s
Wells is no less of a feat.
With humour, great verve,
and a fantastic corps
of dancers, Swan Lake
delivers.
The Curious Incident:ATriumphant Return to London
A
dapted from
Mark Haddon’s
book of the
same name,
this The Curious Incident
of the Dog in the Night-
time tells the story of
Christopher Boone, a
15-year-old who is excep-
tionally gifted at maths yet
struggles with social in-
teractions and many every
day tasks. Christopher
finds his neighbour’s dog,
Wellington, murdered in
her garden and decides
to begin an investigation
into who could be the
culprit, recording all of
his interactions in a book.
A simplistic description
of the plot does little
to capture the magic
that is this production.
Yes, this is a story about
Christopher, but through
his interactions with those
he encounters it becomes
so much more, an explo-
ration of humanity itself.
Playwright Simon
Stephens does a phenom-
enal job of translating
the play to the stage. He
remains faithful to the
much loved book, yet
manages to tailor it to
everything that makes
theatre so enjoyable. To
say that the set and staging
are amazing would be a
criminal understatement.
The ingenious multimedia
set transports you into
Christopher’s world,
giving you an insight into
how he sees things, with
Christopher’s diagrams
springing to life on the
walls. One of the things
most striking about the
book is Christopher’s
sensory overload by the
sights and sounds of busy
London. Haddon’s words
really created a sense of
palpable distress that I
was certain could not be
replicated. Yet this fantas-
tic production proved me
wrong. The abstract use
of sound, light and stage
combine to transport you
straight into Cristopher’s
mind. Director Marianne
Elliott does a great job
of bringing together all
these different elements to
create a truly immersive
experience.
This production has
been through many cast
changes since its debut
at The National Theatre
and it’s a worry to any fan
of the original if the new
casts are able to replicate
the initial magic. There’s
no question here that they
do: Joshua Jenkins is
fantastic as Christopher,
never failing to capture
his vulnerability and con-
fusion. Stuart Laing and
Emma Beattie are brilliant
as Christopher’s parents
Ed and Judy, each of
them is vulnerable in their
own way, burdened by
circumstances. Laing in
particular really captures
the essence of Ed; its im-
possible not to feel a rush
of sympathy for him in the
moments where he breaks
down in front of Christo-
pher. Rounding out the
main cast is Julie Hale,
playing Christopher’s
support worker at school,
Siobhan.
Words cannot describe
how brilliant this perfor-
mance is and honestly,
any fan of theatre should
treat themselves to it. As
the cast took their bows, I
don’t think I could see a
single person seated, we
were all up and giving this
play the standing ovation
it clearly deserved.
