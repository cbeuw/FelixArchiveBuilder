T
he university
pension deficit
has more than
halved since
2017, according to a
report released last week.
A phased increase in
employee contributions
is due to begin in April.
The news coincides
with the beginning of a
consultation to determine
how much financial risk
universities are willing
to take on, as well as the
views of lecturers and
other staff.
The Universities
Superannuation Scheme
(USS) to which most staff
belong last year claimed
to be operating with a £7.5
billion deficit — a figure
disputed by Universities
UK (UUK), which rep-
resents employers. As of
March 2018, the deficit
has been valued at £3.6
billion, following bet-
ter-than-expected returns
on the Scheme’s assets
and investments.
The 2018 valuation
takes into consideration
some of the recommenda-
tions of the Joint Expert
Panel (JEP), which was
set up last year and tasked
with reviewing the 2017
valuation as part of a
deal to resolve industrial
action. The Panel returned
a series of proposed
changes, overwhelming-
ly supported by UUK
members.
USS has indicated it is
prepared to accepted two
of the JEP’s six proposed
adjustments but claims
that implementing the
remaining adjustments
would pose too much
risk, even if additional
contingency support
were to be introduced. In
December Dennis Leech,
Emeritus Professor of
Economics at the Univer-
sity of Warwick, reported
that attendees of a USS
Institutions meeting were
told that adopting all of
the JEP’s proposals would
create a surplus of £0.5
billion and allow contri-
bution rates to drop below
the current level of 26%
Pension deficit down but doubts remain
