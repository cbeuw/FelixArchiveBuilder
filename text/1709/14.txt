Flamboyant family fun with Aladdin the Panto
T
his production
of Aladdin was
a 20th year
celebration of
pantomime at the Hackney
Empire. Panto tends to
deviate from set plot lines,
but this performance uses
Aladdin as a vague guide-
line rather than a script.
There are several layers of
narration, starting with an
impressive 10ft trapped
puppet Goddess Gaia
taking over the stage. The
rest of the show is just as
flamboyantly ridiculous.
Even the location and
characters were given an
East London twist, set in
the far off land of Ha-ka-
ney a town that has just
exited the Eastern Union.
Aladdin is determined to
win the heart of princess
Jasmine, who he is not
legally allowed to set eyes
on. Once they fall in love
and decide to marry, he
is given the challenge of
building a palace in one
day to prove his worth to
the dictatorial Empress.
This is much to the dis-
tress of his brother Dishi,
forever in the shadow of
Aladdin going through
the motions of supporting
him through his wacky
adventures. To greet him,
we shout “What a fittie!”.
There are also plenty of
opportunities to boo and
shout “he’s behind you!”.
Abanazar is a villain so
treacherous he also carries
the title Jacob Peas Bogg.
In pursuit of the lamp, he
must find someone pure
of heart to retrieve it, so
he poses as Aladdin’s
uncle to convince him to
recover it. The high-jinks
and dance numbers that
ensue are wonderfully
outrageous with catchy
songs. Rather than the
genie, it is Aladdin’s
mother, widower Madam
Twankey, played by Clive
Rowe (Duke from Tracy
Beaker!) who is the real
star of the show. She runs
a laundrette in between
her outrageous dance
routines.
This is a show catering
to all the family, where
everyone watching is
encouraged to participate.
There is a sign-language
dance routine led by a
panda for toddlers to
potter along to, and some
less wholesome one-lin-
ers to keep the parents
cackling. Somehow every
character finds their way
to a happy ending. The
goddess and genie is freed,
Aladdin and Jasmine live
happily ever after, the
empress elopes with her
guard Dumpling. Even
Abanazer finds love and
renounces his evil past
for a future with Madam
Twankey. Bizarre, but
wonderful.
Pinter Six: Money can’t buy you love
Now past the halfway
mark, Jamie Lloyd’s
season of Pinter plays
continues to astonish with
each new installment.
What’s impressive is the
curation – the plays are
grouped by subject matter,
rather than chronology,
showcasing the themes
that Pinter revisited
multiple times throughout
his career as a playwright.
Pinter Six is all about
sharp satire of the upper
class: unhappiness, coarse
vulgarity and downright
cruelty lying behind a out-
wardly civilised façade.
Party Time is set at
an opulent dinner party,
given for the rich by the
rich. The guests swan
about in smug self-supe-
riority, uttering vacuous
phrases of small talk.
A civil war seems to be
going on outside, but the
only hint of unease comes
when Dusty (Eleanor
Matsura) interrupts to ask
her husband Terry (John
Simm) what has happened
to her brother Jimmy. The
atmosphere in the party
changes; Terry tells at
her to shut up or she’ll be
‘spanked’; the host of the
party, Gavin (Phil Davis),
makes a disapproving
remark about ‘uncontrol-
lable wives’. A set of giant
doors at the back of the
stage glow at intervals, as
the riot outside continu-
ally threatens to break in
and disrupt the insulated
life of the dinner party.
The finale, where Jimmy
(Abraham Popoola)
bursts through the doors
dripping with blood, is a
bit too heavy-handed for
my liking, though it does
get the point across. ‘The
dark is in my mouth and
I suck it… it’s the only
thing I have.’ Outside the
cushy world of the party, a
hopeless blackness looms
for the rest of society. It’s
hard to pick a standout
from the cast, who are all
excellent. I particularly
enjoyed Simm’s ability
to deliver spine-chilling
menace in a deceptively
pleasant voice. Casting
Matsura, who is half-Jap-
anese, and Popoola, who
is of Nigerian descent, as
the only two who seem
out of place in the cushy
world of Party Time also
lends – intentionally or
otherwise – racial under-
tones to this staging.
The cast of nine remains
the same for Celebration,
this time a more intimate
look at the emptiness of
relationships. Like Party
Time, its cheery title
belies the bleak tone of
the play. Two brothers,
married to two sisters,
are at ‘the most expen-
sive restaurant in town’,
ostensibly to celebrate
the wedding anniversary
of one of the couples,
Lambert (Ron Cook)
and Prue (Celia Imrie).
It soon becomes clear
that true affection is not
to be found in any of the
relationships on display.
Husbands and wives un-
dermine each other with
snide remarks throughout
dinner, with vulgarity
and warped familial ties
being the theme of the
day. ‘All mothers want
their sons to be fucked by
themselves,’ Prue insists,
while reminiscing about
how her mother used to
beat her father till there
was blood on the sheets.
Suki (Katherine Kingsley)
and her husband Russell
(Simm) are no better;
Russell confesses to an
affair with a secretary,
only for Suki to regain the
upper hand with her tales
of when she was a ‘plump
young secretary’ with her
share of filing-cabinet
liaisons. In the middle of
these unhappy conversa-
tions, the restaurant waiter
(Popoola) makes frequent
‘interjections’ about his
grandfather, longing for
a past of culture and tra-
dition which is long gone.
Soutra Gilmour’s set
and costume design are
commendable for how
both plays manage to
disgust us equally in
their overt, though very
different, displays of
opulence. Sleek black
glamour for Party Time
with its constant sense of
threat, ritzy glitter for the
(relatively) light-hearted
Celebration.
I previously reviewed
Pinter Four, a stunning
collection of short
sketches in which Pinter
explored the unreliability
of memory – as escapism,
as bond. Here, too, recol-
lection is subjective for
Lambert and Suki. Their
past relationship is such
a precious memory to
Lambert – “I fell in love
once… and [she] loved
me back” – that he un-
characteristically foots the
bill for everyone, Suki and
Russell included. Suki, on
the other hand, believes
he never loved anything
more than her body. For
all the casual cruelty in
Celebration, it’s this re-
pudiation of the one shred
of genuine emotion in the
play that hits the hardest.
Celebration ends with the
spotlight on the waiter,
who is about to make
‘one last interjection’ –
but what is it? Will it be
a solution to the toxicity
of these relationships, a
way to reclaim genuine
warmth? We will never
know.
Despite being written
9 years apart, the two
plays echo each other
remarkably. Once again,
Jamie Lloyd shows us
how Pinter is still relevant
today - more relevant
than ever in today’s
political climate, in fact,
with its ever-growing
divide between the haves
and have-nots. The false
veneer masking a far
bleaker reality in these
two plays also resonates
with the false perfection
of our online lives and
social media, despite the
loneliness and nihilism
that seem to dog our gen-
eration. A thought-pro-
voking pairing not to be
missed.

Politically charged art or
abandoned bath house?
Courtauld Impressionists:
From Manet to Cézanne
E
ast London sits
close to my heart,
so when I heard
W h i t e c h a p e l
Gallery had an exhibition
related to gentrification
and capitalism, I grabbed
my Felix pen and note-
book and ventured out
of our comfortable West
London.
The two artists in
question; Michael
Elmgreen and Ingar
Dragset, from Denmark
and Norway respective-
ly, have been working
together for over 20 years
now. The duo doesn’t
confine themselves to
one or even a couple of
mediums: their installa-
tions come as full experi-
ences. As I walk through
the doors at the gallery I
enter into a room with a
large swimming pool in
the middle. I could be in
an abandoned Hungarian
bath, but I’m in an art
gallery. The setting is
the Whitechapel Pool, a
public swimming pool
for the local community,
supposedly at its peak
during the 70s. The pool
and the whole story are
of course just fictional
products painting a
vibrant story for the ex-
hibition. It’s not just the
pool in the room though;
a fallen large sculpture,
a metallic car seat and a
big rock weighing down a
trampoline are a few other
things scattered around
the room. Everything is
run-down and abandoned.
There is sand and dust on
the bottom of the pool.
It’s a story of gentrifica-
tion that Elmgreen and
Dragset have painted up
here. It is a story of taking
something away from the
community and giving it
to capitalism. This used
to be a communal pool
bustling with life, but
now it is going to be made
into a luxurious spa for
members only.
The pool is not the
only installation in the
exhibition. On my way up
the stairs I come to face
an ATM machine on the
wall. On the floor beneath
lays a baby in a bassinet.
I freeze up for a second
and look around, wonder-
ing who could have left
their baby here. I see the
gallery guards smirking
over at my reaction. The
baby is a wax doll, a very
believable one. Elmgreen
& Dragset: 1, Amanda:
0. The installation raises
questions; what could
the guardian of this child
possibly have seen on
the screen / have been
doing at the ATM before
deciding to leave their
baby behind?
Even this is not all there
is, there is a room full of
more shocking sculptures,
and another room titled
‘Self-portraits’. I’ll let you
find out what’s in there
on your own though. The
work of Elmgreen and
Dragset is truly performed
in such a thoughtful and
successful way. Living in
the reality of 2018, with
capitalism, gentrification,
populism and a push for
equality, I think art needs
to address these topics,
and discovering new ways
to execute this since the
graffiti of the 80s is even
better. I would even highly
suggest checking out the
artists and their previous
installations online. Defi-
nitely not your average
exhibition at the National
Gallery.
B
orn and brought
up in London,
r e p e a t e d l y
visiting this
gallery with my father
since before I could even
walk, it’s safe to say I’m a
hardcore National Gallery
devotee. Unfortunately,
this is precisely the same
reason this exhibition left
me feeling a sense of un-
familiar disappointment
as I left the building, for
the first time in my life.
Don’t get me wrong
– the exhibition itself
includes a mesmerising
set of paintings, the
unification of Samuel
Courtauld’s historical-
ly split up collection
(between the National
Gallery and the Courtauld
Gallery); it would be
absurd of anyone to deny
the mastery of Seurat’s
‘Bathers at Asnières’,
or Manet’s ‘A Bar at the
Folies-Bergère’.
Perhaps I just had
overly high expectations,
or I hyped the exhibition
up too much in my
own head – a glorious,
ground-breaking union of
all the greatest Impres-
sionist and Post-Impres-
sionist pieces London,
or indeed the UK, had to
offer. Or perhaps I was
hoping for something a
little bit different, or some
sort of examination of the
pieces in a new or differ-
ent way – I’m not really
sure. Instead what we get
is the Courtauld collection
coupled with select pieces
from the National Gallery,
and an admission charge
stuck on it. Many of the
painting descriptions for
National Gallery pieces
were essentially the same
as they usually are in the
free collection, so I felt
a bit robbed. Equally, I
imagine those on holiday
who came to visit the
regular free National
Gallery Impressionism
collection, only to find
half of the pieces taken
away and put in a paid
exhibition, must also be
feeling robbed.
Whilst I liked the way
it was split up by artist,
with each section titled
using emboldened prints
of their signature, it meant
that it was difficult to
cross-examine themes
and techniques between
artists. Further, with only
a few paintings by each
artist, there also weren’t
enough paintings to see
development in their own
styles. However, there
was sufficient relevant
and interesting informa-
tion about every artist and
each painting, making
it ideal for those who
haven’t experienced much
Impressionism, or really
love it and haven’t yet
seen London’s collection
before, with the decent
price tag of £7.50 in such
a case.
The way you’ll feel
about this exhibition
really just depends on
who you are and your
circumstances. If you’ve
been to the National
Gallery countless times,
and have either been to
the Courtauld before or
have time to spare until
it reopens in 2 years, I’m
not sure if this exhibition
is worth it. Considering
the £8 admission for the
Courtauld, with access
to 3 times as much art as
this exhibition (including
2 other art periods along
with this Impressionism
collection), and the fact
that the Courtauld itself
is only a 10 minute walk
away on the other end of
Strand, it would be easily
doable in one day when
the collections are both
back in their respective
normal locations.
But if you have limited
time in London and can’t
afford to wait 2 years, or
are simply eager to feast
your eyes on this astound-
ing collection, then £7.50
is still a pretty good deal.
