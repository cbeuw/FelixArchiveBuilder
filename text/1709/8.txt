Andy’s Top Ten Most Anticipated Albums of 2019
Editor-in-Chief, Andy Djaba, continues his assault on the Music section
O
rdinarily I
would kick off
the year writing
about my top
ten most anticipated hip-
hop albums. However, as
I’ve mentioned before,
I was left quite under-
whelmed by hip-hop in
2019 and I’m struggling to
come up with ten hip-hop
albums I’m really looking
forward to this year. As a
result, I’m expanding my
list to include artists from
some other genres I listen
to (namely, R&B, soul and
artists from out the U.K.).

My TDE bias may be
showing here again but it’s
time that we got the fol-
low-up to Isaiah Rashad’s
stellar 2016 project, The
Sun’s Tirade. Following
TDE’s dominance in 2017
with Kendrick Lamar’s
DAMN. and SZA’s CTRL
albums, I fully expected
TDE’s bench to perform
in 2018. Although we
received albums from
label mates Jay Rock,
SiR and (new signee)
Reason, the rest of the
bench has simply been
lazy. Kendrick and SZA
will not carry the label
forever; it’s time to get in
the studio!
I recently saw a meme
that read, “Bryson Tiller
The eccentric Atlanta
rap duo and Dreamville
signees were on my
“Ones to Watch” list for
2018. They delivered with
a series of impressive
EPs and their impending
album promises to be an
exciting listen. Their out-
landish style has drawn
Outkast comparisons
and they could cement
a position as the biggest
rap group to come out of
Atlanta since the Migos.

2018 came and went
without Chance dropping
a project. Instead, he
dropped off a series of
mediocre singles, all in
the same happy-go-lucky,
positive, gospel-influ-
enced style that we’ve
heard before (and are
getting slightly bored of
now).Tobefairtotheman,
he’s been busy proposing
to his long-term girlfriend
and doing endless socil
activism for the people in
his city of Chicago. But
enough is enough; time
to get back in the studio!
He must think he can live
off Coloring Book and
his ‘3’ hats forever. 2016
was a long time ago now
and Chance is no longer
hip-hop’s golden child.
It’s time for Chance to
deliver with a follow-up
project and prove he has
the potential to challenge
for the hip-hop throne.

Daniel Caesar
Ever since hearing his
unique blend of sultry
R&B and neo-soul on his
breakout debut album,
Freudian, in 2017, I’ve
been a massive Daniel
Caesar fan. He was rel-
atively quiet in 2018 but
still managed to drop one
of my favourite tracks of
the year with his T-Pain
assisted single, ‘Who Hurt
You?’. He has since found
himself a sweet one and
cut the dreads. Everyone
knows what that means.
We’re going to receive the
R&B we deserve in 2019.

ScHoolboy Q

ScHoolboy Q is another
lazy member of the
TDE bench. ScHoolboy
drops amazing, cohesive
gangster rap albums and
2016’s Grammy-nominat-
ed Blank Face LP was no
different. After promising
an album every other year
and, following rumours
that his follow-up album
was actually ready back
in 2017, I was surprised to
not hear from Q last year.
The death of his close
friend Mac Miller may
have had something to do
with the delay in dropping
the album and it would
be interesting and almost
cathartic to hear from Q
about how he is dealing
with the grief of losing his
friend. They say the best
music comes from a place
of pain so we could be in
for a touching and special
album from Groovy Q.

Bryson Tiller

really dropped ‘Don’t’and
dipped”. With his 2016
sophomore album, True
to Self, flopping badly and
the ensuing sophomore
slump, the casual fan can
be forgiven for thinking
Bryson has disappeared
since his stellar 2015
project, Trapsoul. Byson
seems to be in a better
place now and, with his
new girlfriend in tow to
inspire some beautiful
R&B, 2019 could prove
to be his comeback year.
Bad gal riri is on this
list because I’m tired of
seeing Fenty Beauty this
and Fenty x Savage that,
whilst hearing no new
music. Her last musical
offering came in 2016
with her album, Anti.
There have since been
rumours that she’s been
hard at work preparing a
‘reggae’ album, which I
would be very interested
to hear and represents a
return to her Bajan roots.
However, I’m not actually
hopeful of us receiving
any new music this year if
I’m perfectly honest. With
Fenty Beauty, Rihanna
has secured the bag. I
don’t see her distracting
herself from the make-up
millions to indulge us
with another album any
time soon.

Stormzy has been pretty
quiet since 2017’s Gang
Signs and Prayer, making
moves outside of music,
such as launching a book
deal and Adidas clothing
line, and collaborating
with Cambridge Universi-
ty. As arguably the biggest
grime artist in the UK,
the pressure is on for him
to perform with a stellar
follow-up album. I’m
interested to see if he con-
tinues down the positive,
gospel-influenced style or
returns to his gritty, grimy,
‘Wickedskengman’ roots
with this project.

You may remember
when I reviewed Samm
Henshaw’s Scala concert
at the end of October, I
hinted that he could be the
future of UK soul music.
Well 2019 is the year he
will drop an album that
supports my bold claims.
You heard it here first.

Ever since I heard
Dave and AJ Tracey’s
2016 collab track ‘Thiago
Silva’, I’ve been a fan
and followed both artists.
While AJ has flooded the
market with singles and
EPs, Dave has taken a
more measured approach.
Dave is the best rapper
in the U.K. right now.
Just listen to his verses
on Giggs’ ‘Peligro’
and Headie One’s
‘18HUNNA’ if you don’t
believe me. All we need is
an album to prove it.
