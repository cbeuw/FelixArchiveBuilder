Getting under the skin: a new hope for cancer treatment
C
utaneous T-cell
l y m p h o m a
(CTCL) is a rare
cancer of the
skin, which occurs when
T cells, a type of white
blood cell in the lymphat-
ic system, grow out of
control within the skin.
This is often initially
mistaken for other skin
conditions like psoriasis,
dermatitis or eczema, as
it presents as red, scaly
patches, or itchy plaques
on the skin.
Advanced stages of the
disease involve the lymph
nodes and internal organs.
Whilst treatable, CTCL is
generally incurable, and
current systemic therapies
(drugs which spread
throughout the body)
rarely provide reliable
responses in patients.
Some CTCL tumour
cells express a cell

in question will the drug
be released, killing the
tumour cell.
In 2017 a clinical trial
looking at an ADC that
targeted CD30-positive
cells in CTCL showed
exciting results.
The main endpoint of
the trial, which assessed
patients with a reduction
in tumour size over a
period of four months,
showed that this drug
was four and a half times
better at doing so than the
standard choice of drug by
physicians.
This drug was approved
for use in the EU one year
ago, and offers significant
hope for patients affected
by this disease, which
causes significant disfig-
urement and adversely
affects the quality of life
of its patients.
