New Year, New Me
H
APPY NEW
YEAR! For
those of you
that have the
misfortune of actually
reading this, I hope you've
missed me as much as I've
missed you. You won't be-
lieve what time I'm writing
this editorial. It's not even
10pm. New year, new me,
for real! One of my New
Year's Resolutions was to
become more organised
and not be so stressed
out on a Thursday night
and I'm succeeding so far.
Let's see how long this
lasts...
I'm not usually one to
write New Year's Res-
olutions but I was in a
reflective mood on New
Year's Eve. Looking back
at my 2018, I'm pretty
sure I flopped all the res-
olutions I had at the start
of the year. 2019 will be
different.
During the Christ-
mas break, I watched a
YouTube tutorial titled,
"How to write an editori-
al". As you can probably
tell, the video was useless.
It started with a warning
about the importance of
a good editorial in estab-
lishing early credibility
as an editor of a publica-
tion. Too late for that at
this stage! Anyway, the
'proper way' of writing an
editorial is dull and I much
prefer rambling until I hit
a page. This editorial has
almost become a personal
diary for me, where I can
reflect on my week and get
the inner workings of my
mind down on paper. In
fact, due to the fact I can't
count, we almost went
without an editorial this
week (I'm not sure if there
are rules against this). To
be perfectly honest, I'm
not sure what the rules
are. They seem to just
leave me in the basement
and let me get on with it.
This week's issue sees
Deputy Editor, Joanna,
take control of the News
section while I continue
my assauly on the Music

Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-
ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach
you everything you need to know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk
section. The News article
highlighting the potential
impending crisis in Higher
Education is a must-read!
My Music article is decent
too if you happen to flick
to page 8.
As usual, the Arts
section continues to go
from strength to strength.
This week, there's five
pages of #content. I'm
struggling to choose my
section of the week. (I'm
also struggling to fill the
space in this editorial,
but that's another issue).
I'm in two minds. On the
one hand, the Arts section
has the most pages and
the Arts Editors' whole-
someness warms my heart
every Wednesday. On
the other hand, I wrote a
Music article so obviously
I' that way inclined. In
the interest of fairness,
I'm going to go against
my bias and give Section
of the week to the News
section. Joanna's hard-hit-
ting journalism takes the
W this week. Congrats!
This editorial has
been a real struggle. If,
for some reason, you're
still reading, please don't
let this deter you from
continuing to read the
paper. I promise we have
an excellent issue for you
this week. In fact, I have
very high hopes for the
paper this term. Every-
body knows what they're
doing now, my early
teething problems have
all been worked out and
there promises to be some
very interesting stories on
the horizon. This term,
Felix is all about cultural
enrichment; we will be
showing you how to get
to the bag all throughout
2019. Ok, I've rambled
enoug. See you next week.
