Of Missed Opportunities and Vanity: Books from the
Balkans
BOOKS
Pavan Inguva
Books Writer
N
ormally, I
would start
off by sharing
how I seren-
dipitously came across a
beautiful bookstore or an
author, or book, related to
the country I am travelling
to. This isn’t one of those
occasions. The two books
I write about here came to
me in a far more dubious
manner. The first book
was stuck in my Amazon
shopping cart for months.
I cannot for the life of me
figure out what course of
events led to its inclusion
in my cart and eventual
purchase. The second
book came to me as I was
looking for a quote by a
Croatian author to use as
a caption for one of the
pictures I took whilst in
Croatia (for the gram).
Regardless of the less than
ideal circumstances in
which I came to know of
these authors and books,
they are remarkably
profound reads, shedding
light on the Balkans, a
region with tremendously
complex history and
geopolitics.
The Bridge on
the Drina by Ivo
Andric
different ethno-religious,
socio-economic and
personal factors. We
often think of places like
Sarajevo or Istanbul as
being the central points
where the winds of change
blow the hardest during
the periods of the Ottoman
and Austro-Hungarian
empires. This is certainly
true from a macroscopic,
historical point of view,
but Andric takes a com-
pletely different approach,
focusing on how a smaller
township and its racially
and religiously diverse
people adapt and interact
with the changing times.
I found this approach in-
credibly humanising and
historically informative,
which arguably is one of
the primary appeals of
historical fiction.
The one thing I regret
from this read was that I
did not take the time to
visit said bridge whilst in
Bosnia. As I was standing
in the location where
Archduke Franz Ferdi-
nand was shot in Sarajevo,
I was in awe of the fact
that I was standing in the
same location where one
of the 20th century’s most
defining moments took
place. I would imagine
that after having read
Andric’s work, having
felt the richness of human
experiences and history
on the bridge, the feeling
of awe when I visit will be
similar.
The Banquet
in Blitva by
Miroslav Krleza
this point, I felt bad that
I was willing to use one
of his quotes without
having read his work. So
to alleviate my guilt from
literary vanity, I ordered a
copy on amazon. Krleza
is hands down one of the
edgiest authors I’ve ever
read. This guy is more
than willing to call a spade
a spade in the crudest
manner good literature
permits. The state of flux
and political climate of
central Europe in the 20th
century has unfortunately
given many a talented
author keen insight into
power and human nature
and Krleza’s work serves
as an excellent example
of this. Whilst this series
is a trilogy, only the first
two books are available in
English as a set.
The book is set in the
fictional Balkan state of
Blitva pre-WW2 with an
arguably stereotypical
troubled founding story
following the fall of the
Austro-Hungarian empire.
The book focuses on
Colonel Kristian Barun-
tanski, the dictator who
spearheaded Blitva’s push
for independence, and Dr
Niels Nielson, an intel-
lectual and Baruntanski’s
childhood friend calling
for his death as a traitor
to Blitva. Dr Nielson
published an open letter
calling for the Colonel’s
head. This sparks an es-
calating conflict between
the two, culminating in a
cliffhanger ending in the
second book with Nielson
fleeing to neighboring
Blatvia. This conflict
served as a thinly veiled
satire on how nationalism
has panned out in the
region, both ideologically
and practically. Several
ancillary characters
such as Major Georgis,
Baruntanski’s hitman,
were also well developed,
helping to characterise the
inherent contradictions
in human nature and the
divergent interest various
stakeholders may have in
relation to political struc-
tures and action. Overall,
Krleza has put together
a complex and edgy
read. Power through and
you are rewarded with a
remarkable insight into
variety of topics.
Books writer, Pavan Inguva, explores two books that shed light on the Balkans
Nobel Prize for Literature winner, Ivo Andric, in front of the bridge on the Drina // Serbia.com
“These authors
and books...
are remarkably
profound
reads,
shedding
light on the
Balkans”
Andric, born in Bosnia,
received the Nobel prize
for literature in 1961 and
this is his best-known
work. The focal point
of the book is the titular
bridge spanning the river
Drina in Visegrad, Bosnia.
Andric chronicles the life
and times of the people
of the town as it occurs
around this bridge over
several hundred years
from before the bridge
was built in 1577 up-to
the start of World War
1 in 1914. Due to its
remarkable construction,
the Mehmed Pasa bridge
serves as an excellent
symbol for permanence
and is an UNESCO
world heritage site today.
Andric skillfully portrays
the human experience by
introducing and develop-
ing multiple characters
during each time-period,
providing continuity
where appropriate. The
ensemble of diverse char-
acters outlines both the
commonalities of experi-
ences we share, and also
the variety of responses
we may have to changing
times as a function of
“In a drop of wine,
the universe sparkles.”
