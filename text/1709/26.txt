Couch-to-5k: From Couch Potatoes to Runner Beans
“The ICXCAC
Sunday
breakfast
is one of
Imperial’s best-
kept secrets.”
“Shout-out to
Charlotte and
her chocolate
balls”
Y
ou know how
some people
start the ac-
ademic year
determined to do their
best?
We, the couch potatoes,
decided to trade Netflix
for ICXCAC and running
shoes.
We know what you’re
thinking: why would
perfectly sane people give
up the TV for running? At
first, that was us as well.
Who in their right mind
likes running except for
runners?
Personally, running was
something I only consid-
Yet we all signed up
and so the training began.
We were gradually
introduced to the runner’s
world by the wonderful
ICXCAC women’s
captain, Charlotte Barratt.
The programme
followedtheNHS‘Couch-
to-5K programme’, a
training programme
designed to allow couch
potatoes to eventually run
a 5 kilometre race in a
measly 9 weeks.
The first session was
supposed to be relatively
easy; we only ran in 1
minute intervals.
As easy as that sounds,
by the end of it I was
almost ready to quit and as
training practices became
more intense I began con-
sidering this option more
and more.
Although I hate to
admit it, the only thing
that kept me going was
food.
In my opinion, the
ICXCAC Sunday break-
fast is one of Imperial’s
best-kept secrets.
As a broke student
who has an addiction to
brunch, these runs were
the perfect bait.
Run and you’ll get a
full English.
Once we realised
that ICXCAC members
had the metabolism and
passion to be serious
foodies, we couch
potatoes started showing
up for more events.
Some of these events
were events we genuinely
never imagined doing
such as 7am core sessions
(yeah, they’re those
people), LUCA Cross
Country races (4-6km
races on muddy trails up
and down steep hills in
some of London’s parks)
to even trying out athlet-
ics’ track and field.
The best thing about
these events was the love
and support shown by the
other members, because
even though we weren’t
competitive athletes we
were never made to feel
like we didn’t belong.
In each session
we started with drills to
perfect our technique and
afterwards learnt how
to stretch our different
muscle groups.
After 5 weeks we
were already running 20
minutes non-stop around
Hyde Park in the dark
wearing fluorescent gear,
keeping a good pace, and
managing not to look like
our arms and legs were
spaghetti floating around
our body.
After a long term
of constantly pushing
our limits, the Richmond
Park Christmas 5k (AKA
our big debut as runners)
eventually arrived.
In typical British spirit,
that morning it decided to
rain cats and dogs.
That didn’t deter us
though.
Armed with face paint
and our very first race
number we ambushed
the starting line, ready to
make our mark.
The prospect of eating
baked goods after the
race was definitely a
motivating factor (shout-
out to Charlotte and her
chocolate balls).
What a successful race
it was!
All 9 of us not only
managed to complete
the race in 35 minutes
and earn ourselves the
biggest medal ever (with
a Christmas pudding on),
but the incredible Michael
Fu, Fintan O’Connor
and Claire Zhang even
placed in the top 3 in their
respective categories
“They all abso-
lutely smashed it”, said
Couch-to-5k Captain
Charlotte.
“I can’t believe how
far they came in just
one term. It’s a massive
personal achievement.
“Watching them cross
the finish line on race day
like real athletes in their
ICXCAC vests made me
incredibly proud, a bit like
a mother bird watching
her chicks fly off from
the nest for the first time.
Except running.
“Michael, Fintan,
Claire, Karyshma,
Noemie, Rachel, Nathalie,
Lisa, Gabby and Maria -
you’re all superstars”.
Our journey doesn’t
end there though.
Some of us (Noemie,
we’re looking at you)
didn’t manage to make
it to the race, so, we’re
hoping to run a 5k
together again in spring…
just because we can.
Now that we speak the
runner lingo, we all also
want to try to get a new
PB (personal best) and
a SB (season’s best) and
maybe even a 10k under
our belts while we’re at it.
Turns out, running is
addictive and now we’re
one of “those guys”.
Nobody told the Couch-to-5kers that their prize medals were not in fact large chocolate coins // ICXCAC

the snooze button one too
