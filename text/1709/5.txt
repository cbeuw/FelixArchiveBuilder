P
eace is something
you give, not
something you
ask others to give
you.” This is a particularly
poignant quote shared by
Hyppolite Ntigurirwa
when describing the
harrowing experiences of
growing up in the middle
of the Rwandan geno-
cide. During the United
Nations Peace Summit
of Emerging Leaders
2018, which took place in
Bangkok from November
28-30th, I was able to hear
the innumerable accounts
of incredible struggle and
bravery from both the
speakers and delegates.
I have been avidly
involved in social justice
action and health-peace
advocacy whilst being a
part of, and now Presi-
dent of, the organisation
Students for Global
Health. When Imperial
Business School pub-
licised this opportunity
to represent Imperial at
the summit, I knew it
would be an enriching
experience culturally,
socially, academically and
personally.
The summit made clear
to me that the greatest
challenges we face, in our
increasingly complex and
uncertain world, all stem
from the unabated aspira-
tion for peace. Issues that
challenge peace should
be a concern for all – par-
ticularly in our globalised
world of unprecedented
communication, intercon-
nectedness and migration.
The threats to peace also
come from the inequality,
disenfranchisement and
marginalisation suffered
by vulnerable groups,
as well as the rejection
and ignorance of other
cultures, together with
their traditions and beliefs.
It is imperative to
understand that although
peace is the absence of
direct violence (negative
peace), it is also, more
importantly, the process
by which the roots of
conflict are addressed and
non-violent means for
resolving conflict are dis-
covered (positive peace).
Positive peace has a trans-
formative and restorative
goal, it uses the notions of
social cosmology, culture
and ecology to promote
a more sustainable future
for the world.
Positive peace takes
longer to achieve as
it recognises the time
needed for further analyse
of ingrained structural and
cultural matters. Cultural
understanding emerges as
a vital factor in achieving
lasting positive peace,
and hence is a vital
foundation for achieving
equitable progress and
social cohesion in regards
peace through art,
cross-cultural dialogue,
workshops and exhibi-
tions to create a shared
vision for peace. Express-
ing oneself through art
and creation has proven
to be an essential tool in
conflict reconciliation, as
art is rooted in culture and
encourages the deepest
level of human experi-
ence.
Not only is art and
cultural awareness un-
derstood as a restorative
means for healing the
scars of war but can be
beneficial for any mar-
ginalised communities
or individuals wanting
to reconnect with their
identities. The success of
Peace Masks, and cultural
groups alike, is a beautiful
reminder that the fate
of humanity depends on
fostering appreciation
for diversity and paving
the way for meaningful
mutual prosperity.
Ultimately, we all
should endeavour to
acquire true knowledge
for our overall betterment
and for universal welfare,
with a particular focus on
issues that threaten peace
in today’s global commu-
nity.
