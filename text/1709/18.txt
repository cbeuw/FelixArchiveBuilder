The meat of the problem

Following another
festive holiday,
many people may
be seeking new year’s
resolutions to adhere to,
ideally in support of good
causes. Going vegan or
“zero waste” might be an
option worth considering
when it comes to environ-
mental sustainability. But
will cutting down meat
consumption really
help with global waste
management?
FAO (Food and Agri-
culture Organization) has
predicted that the global
meat consumption will
double by 2050, as an
inevitable result of popu-
lation growth and increas-
ing demand in developing
countries. However, there
is also data suggesting the
potentially jeopardizing
effect of this trend on meat
production requirements.
It shouldn’t come as a
surprise that to produce
meat, the animals need to
be fed first. This translates
into much higher demand
for both land and water
usage. Raising livestock
for food production
uses 83% of the world’s
farmland and accounts
for 56-58% of agricultural
pollutant emissions, but
provides only 37% of our
protein and 18% of caloric
intake, according to an
Oxford University study.
The study also stated that
even the lowest impact
meat and dairy products
still pose more environ-
mental threat than the least
sustainable vegetables and
cereals (so, keep dipping
your pita in hummus).
The land is mostly used
for production of animal
feed and grazing, which
can be detrimental to
wildlife through deforest-
ation and alterations to
their habitats. Further-
more, ruminant farming
is still infamous for its
greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission; in particular,
the potent GHG methane.
The arable land also needs
to be irrigated for crop
production, meaning that
animal products require
far more water than crops
alone, because of the
colossal amount of feed
that go into their produc-
tion. The livestock sector
is now considered to be
the number one water
polluter, due to the waste
associated with livestock
farming. In addition to
manure and slurry, vet-
erinary medicines such
as antibiotics can enter
downstream ecosystems
and water sources, endan-
gering the livelihood of
aquatic species. Although
tthe severity of different
farming practices varies
across the world, the
transition to a diet that
excludes animal products
can still be hugely bene-
ficial, resulting in a 76%
reduction in land usage
and 49% drop in GHG
emissions, whilst sub-
stantially mitigating water
contamination.

wastes around 123kg of
food per year, 80% of
which is avoidable. This
is equivalent to wasting an
apple a day at minimum,
or a loaf of bread a day
at maximum. Despite
the fact that meat waste
is not the main culprit
when it comes to overall
waste quantity, it is re-
sponsible for most of the
wasted water and nitrogen
resources because of its
resource-intensive nature.
Lowering consumer meat
intake will therefore
still greatly support the
initiative to reduce waste
footprints.
The figures are indeed
quite staggering, and

Research on EU

relative contributions of
different food groups to
overall waste production
and resource depletion.

Veganuary continues
