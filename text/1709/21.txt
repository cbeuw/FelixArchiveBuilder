Y
ield curve
inversions have
traditionally
been a fore-
telling sign of impending
recessions. To explain the
idea of a yield curve, one
needs to understand what
exactly a yield is. A yield
to maturity, or simply
bond yield has multiple
interpretation, the sim-
plest being – it is the return
an investor realises on a
bond. For instance, a yield
of 4.5% on a bond implies
that an investor would get
a return equivalent to a
4.5% annual interest rate
in a bank account. Bond
yields are inversely relat-
ed to bond prices, when
bond prices are low, the
yields are high, vice versa.
However, high
yields are not always
ideal. During the Greek
debt crisis and Greek
bond default, Greek
government bond yields
(10Y) reached yield as
high as 48.60 before
the Greek government
defaulted. Bond yields,
while giving a yardstick
for retail investors to
compare the returns on
their investment between
different bonds, does
not account for the
risk of default – hence
astronomically high yields
implies that investors are
valuing the bonds very
low prices to account for
the likelihood of default.
Moving on, a yield
curve simply illustrates
the yields of a type of
bond against the maturity
of the same bond (e.g.
yield of 10Y U.S. bond
against the maturity of 10
Years). A standard yield
curve is shown below.
There are 3 crucial things
to understand about the
yield curve:
However, when bond
traders suspect that
the FED would lower
interest rates in light of
an impending recession,
bond traders would
began buying long-term
government bonds as
the price of long-term
government bonds would
rise when the FED lower
interest rates. Hence
bond traders would
begin buying long-term
government bonds and
this would lower the yield
of long-term government
bonds. This reflects a
pessimistic investor
sentiment towards the
market, and it is a strong
warning sign of an
impending recession.
Overall, it can be
observed that a yield
curve inversion – when
the yields of long-term
government bonds
becomes lower than
the yields of short-term
government bond, it is a
strong warning sign of
an impending recession.
Historically, the bond
curve has inverted 7
times since the 1980s,
out of which, 6 times the
bond curve inversion has
predicted and preceded
recession. The 6 times
were: the two 1970s oil
crisis, the 1980s recession,
the 1990s recession, the
early 2000s dotcom burst,
and the 2008 Global
Financial Crisis. Each
time, the bond curve
inversion happened less
than 2 years prior to each
recession.
In recent times, the
spread between the
3-year and 5-year U.S.
government bond has
turned negative (i.e. one
segment of the yield curve
has inverted). Moreover,
the spread between the
2-year and 10-year U.S.
government bond lies
at 17.6bp (or 0.176%
point spread). While the
current yield curve has
yet to be fully inverted, it
can be seen that the yield
curve is flattening Given
the hawkish stance the
FED has been assuming
(hawkish refers to the FED
closely watching inflation
and would likely raise
rates), the flattening of the
yield curve implies that
bond traders suspect that
the FED would assume a
dovish position in the near
future. Ironically, the Fed
still chose to raise interest
rates in Dec 2018 despite
the foretelling signs of
yield curve inversion – a
harbinger of recession.
Nevertheless, it is
imperative to keep in mind
that the timeline between
yield curve inversion and
economic recessions are
not instantaneous. The
yield between the three to
five year maturity bonds
dipped below zero during
August 2005, two years
prior to the start of the
Global Financial Crisis.
1. Short-term
government bonds (<2
Years) typically has a
lower yield relative to
long-maturity government
bonds because long-
maturity bonds tend to
have a higher default risk
(hencethepricesof10year
maturity bonds tend to be
lower and their yields tend
to be higher). i.e. the Yield
curve is upward sloping in
a normal scenario.
2. Short-term
government bond yields
are controlled by the
central bank via monetary
policy. In the U.S. context,
this is done by adjusting
the Federal Funds Rate
or by carrying out Open
Market Operations (Sale
or purchase of government
bonds). When the U.S.
Central Bank (the FED)
raises the Fed funds rate,
this increases the cost of
borrowing for overnight
loans by commercial
bank and commercial
banks would raise their
interest rates conversely.
In times of inflations
(high economic growth/
Overheating), the FED
would raise interest rates
to relieve the inflationary
pressure while during
times of deflations
(recessions), the FED
would lower interest rates.
3. The long-term
government bond yields
are controlled by bond
traders and reflects the
sentimentsofbondtraders.
For instance, when the
market is performing
well, bond traders would
expect that the FED would
raise interest rates, and
conversely, this would
lower the price of bonds
and increases yields. Bond
traders in turn, would
start selling the long-term
bonds in anticipation
of this rate hike (and
decrease in bond prices),
leading to high yields for
the long-term government
bonds. In this sense, an
upward sloping yield
curve reflects a healthy
economy.

n the past, industry
specific start-up
“rules of thumb” may
havebeensufficientto
serve as reasonable basis
for any valuation concern.
Combined with the unique
market dynamics and
regulatory environment
associated with the med-
ical technology industry,
start-ups in this field
present a unique set of
valuation considerations.
In recent years, valuation
issues have become in-
creasingly important for
start-up companies due
to changing international
reporting standards and
financial reporting rules.
These issues along with
increasing regulatory
and shareholder scrutiny
together compound poten-
tial troubles for start-up
companies. Because both
the subject enterprise and
valuation purpose are
misfits within the context
of typical valuation work,
valuation practices are
generally not applicable
for start-up companies.
In reality, the appropriate
definition of value varies
depending on the circum-
stances surrounding each
valuation engagement.
This article discusses
common circumstances
that give rise to the need
for a valuation, basic
valuation concepts, and
specific valuation con-
siderations relevant to
medical technology start-
up companies.
Firstly, what are the
most common standards
of value for start-up
companies? There are
broadly two standards
of value for start-ups:
fair market value and
investment value. Fair
market value is the most
common standard of value
used in business appraisals
is available in sufficient
quantity and quality. The
marketapproachcompares
the subject to similar
businesses, business
ownership interests, or
other assets that have
been recently transacted.
However, such per share
pricing information from
capital rounds provides
helpful valuation anchors
in the form of upper or
lower boundaries for
enterprise value, and
can credibly substantiate
the reasonableness of
valuation conclusions.
Consideration of prior
completed financing
rounds or other
transactions in interests
of a start-up is also a
method under the market
approach.
Market methods
include comparison
of the subject interest
with valuation metrics
implied by investments in
publicly traded companies
and those implied by
transactions involving
controlling interests in
similar companies. Most
start-ups are not near
IPO or acquisition, so
there is generally not
sufficient information to
implement the market
approach to determine
the enterprise value for
start-up enterprises with
the exception of the
occasional very late stage
start-up.
Thirdly, what valuation
considerations should be
accounted for in medical
technology start-ups?
Valuation of medical
technology start-ups take
into account anticipated
future capital needs, the
probability of successful
exit, time to successful
exit, and the potential
exit value. For medical
technology companies,
exit events are usually
via acquisition or IPOs.
Furthermore, exit events
and values are influenced
by four factors which are
market characteristics,
market impact, stage of
development, and key
success indicators.
All companies operate
within a given market and
this context is perhaps the
most significant factor
in the exit valuation of a
medical technology start-
up. The most significant
market factor to consider
for a medical technology
start-up is the absolute
size and growth prospects
for the pertinent market.
Even if a start-up has
everything else in place,
100% market share of
nothing is still nothing.
Other than the
disruptive potential of
the new technology itself,
strategic acquirers in
the medical technology
space commonly consider
a variety of factors in
evaluating the potential
market. These factors
include impact of a new
technology, strength of
intellectual property,
stability of design,
technical performance
data, support from
human clinical studies,
completion of regulatory
approvals, and reputation
of “early-adopter” using
technology, reliability
of supply chain and
distribution partners, and
availability of technical
expertise.
Most medical
technology start-ups
tend to follow similar
patterns in operational
development regardless
of industry segment.
The value of a given
start-up is largely related
to its level of operational
development. Generally,
meeting later-stage
milestones generates
greater increases in value
than that of earlier-stage
milestones.
Due to this relative lack
of information, qualitative
factors such as the quality
of the management
team, clinical advisory
team, and venture capital
investor group become an
important consideration,
especially in the valuation
of early-stage start-ups.
In conclusion, given
the incremental valuation
complexities particular
to medical technology
start-up enterprises, it is
important to remember
that industry knowledge
and valuation knowledge
are not synonymous—and
both are important. Firstly,
the definition of value by
an investor or investing
group determines how
value is attributed to a
medical technology start-
up: a start-up can have
multiple values attributed
based on value definition.
Secondly, the value of a
medical start-up depends
on the unique investing
approach of an investor
/ investing group: a
start-up can have multiple
values based on investing
approach. Thirdly, the
value of a medical
technology start-up
significantly depends on
its market characteristics,
market impact, product
development stage, and
key success indications.
Finally, we encourage
readers to extend business
dialogue to include
valuation and specific
valuation considerations
relevant to medical
technology start-up
companies.
and is the standard used
for compliance related
to equity compensation.
On the other hand,
investment value is the
value to a specific investor
based on their particular
investment requirements
and opportunities.
Secondly, what are
the general approaches
to determining business
value? There are three
general approaches to
determining business
value – asset, income,
and market. Ultimately,
the conclusion of value
will reflect consideration
of one or more of these
approaches (and perhaps
various underlying
methods) as being most
indicative of value for the
subjectownershipinterest.
The asset approach can
provide meaningful
valuation benchmarks
for start-ups that have
recently completed
fund-raising rounds.
For start-up companies,
the asset approach is
generally inappropriate to
apply unless the start-up
is in a very early stage of
operational development
such that there has been
no intellectual property
or other intangible value
developed internally.
Accordingly, single-
period capitalization of
income methods and
conventional applications
of discounted future
benefits methods are
rarely appropriate to use.
The mechanics of an
income method require
an estimate of future cash
flows and an appropriate
discount rate with which
to determine the present
value of future cash flows.
The income approach is
based on the idea that
the value for a given
enterprise is created by the
expectation of future cash
flows and thus focuses on
the capacity of a start-up
company to generate
future economic benefits.
The market approach
is the preferred approach
when appropriate data
