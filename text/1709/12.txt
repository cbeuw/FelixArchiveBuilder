Caroline or Change Review
C
a r o l i n e
Thibodeaux is
only 39, but her
life is already
reduced to the basement
of the Gellman household
in which she is a maid,
where the washing ma-
chine, dryer and old radio
are her only companions.
Well, apart from eight-
year-old Noah Gellman
that is. Noah idolises
Caroline, taking every
opportunity to spend
time with her, even when
she treats him with cool
indifference or chastises
him for leaving his
pocket money in his dirty
laundry. When Noah’s
stepmother Rose insists
Caroline start keeping
any change she finds, to
teach Noah a lesson about
money, it brings into sharp
focus Caroline’s situation
and highlights her moral
dilemma: forced to start
considering keeping a
child’s lost pocket money
to help make ends meet
for herself and her four
children.
Playwright Tony
Kushner is best known
for his widely acclaimed
Angels in America,
notable for its highly
intimate personal stories
set against the backdrop
of world changing events.
Caroline or Change also
carries this particular
Kushner trademark: its
1963 and John F Kennedy
has just been assassinated,
the American Civil Rights
movement is growing: it’s
clearly a period of great
change for America as
a whole. And so it is for
Caroline: she’s come to
this point, 39 and with
life looking bleak, when
change is in order. The
combination of small
intimate individual stories
and world changing po-
litical events just draws
each into sharper focus,
Caroline’s personal
dilemmas reflect the
frustration and thirst for
change of a nation, whilst
the sweeping changes
across the country are
juxtaposed with how
slow progress can be for
people on the ground like
Caroline, whilst keeping
up the hope that change is
very much in the air.
Jeanine Tesori’s music
is the perfect partner to
Kushner’s words, trans-
forming what might seem
like bleak subject matter
into something fun and
heart-warming. It pairs
particularly well with one
of the most original and
fun aspects of the show:
the personification of
choice inanimate objects,
such as the washing
machine and dryer that
are Caroline’s constant
companions as in the
basement. Fly Davis’s
fantastic costumes help
bring them to life, espe-
cially the 60s- inspired
washing machine (Mesha
Bryon) in her extrava-
gant costume of plastic
bubbles.
Sharon D Clarke, our
titular Caroline, is un-
doubtedly the star of the
show. Her commanding
stage presence makes it
difficult to look away.
And indeed its difficult
to want to; she’s amazing
as Caroline, effortlessly
capturing her despair, but
also her quiet dignity. This
isn’t to say that the rest of
the cast are weak. Quite
the opposite: there isn’t
a single weak link in this
production, with the entire
ensemble cast delivering
excellent performances.
So many things come
together to make Caroline
or Change the visual
treat that it is. A fantastic
musical brought to life by
a near perfect production,
this is one of the definite
‘must see’ shows of this
winter.
Swan Lake – A Lively Traditional Performance
S
wan Lake is
perhaps the most
renowned classical
ballet repertoire
still routinely performed.
Recent productions such
as Matthew Bourne’s
reimagined all male
production or even the
twisted representation
on screen in Black Swan
have only increased its
popularity.
The English National
Ballet have kept tradition
and modern ballet alive
with Derek Deane’s
production of Swan Lake.
Originally performed
in-the-round at the Royal
Albert Hall in 1997 and
then restaged for con-
ventional theatres, it has
proven a hit for the ENB
over the years.
This ninth production is
performed in the glorious
London Coliseum.
English ballet, whilst
perhaps not quite as ul-
tra-refined as its Russian
counterpart, when done
well is a wonderful spec-
tacle. This performance
had it all; lavish costume,
impressive scenery, strong
performances from the
corps de ballet and barely
a wobble onstage.
It was refreshing to
see traditional ballet done
well, with a few twists
here and there. In this pro-
duction, Tchaikovsky’s
wonderfully written score
was beautifully conducted
by Gavin Sutherland.
A standout of the night
was “The dance of the
little swans” (cygnets);
the well-loved and incred-
ibly difficult pas-de-qua-
tre. The four ballerinas
were completely in sync
for the whole section; a
rarity, with fantastic tech-
nique which gained large
well-deserved applause.
Overall the company
performed well; the swans
section in Act II always
a delight with a good
corps de ballet. A standout
performer of the ensemble
was Precious Adams,
not forgetting Daniel
McCormick’s impressive
leaps and Julia Conway’s
impressive pointe work of
the pas de trois in Act I.
Both the character
parts, Queen (Jane
Hayworth) and tutor
(Michael Coleman), were
well played. Providing
laughter and storytelling.
Rothbart (James Streeter),
the villain of the piece,
is always a difficult role
and in this production the
characterisation improved
through the ballet.
Isaac Hernández
reprised his role as Prince
Siegfried, before as a guest
artist, now a company
member of the ENB.
Whilst appearing a little
off balance at the start of
the ballet and lacking in
characterisation, he really
came into his own during
the later acts, especially
with an impressive solo
performance in Act III,
with wonderful flying
grand jetés and beautiful
pirouettes.
Odette and Odile are
traditionally played by
the same dancer. Jurgita
Dronina portrayed a
vulnerable Odette, whilst
mastering the flirtatious
nature of Odile. The
change in character was
noticeable as soon as she
stepped on stage in Act
III, she seems to convey
both characters through
her upper body gestures
and face with ease. Her
technique is delightful,
mastering the somewhat
incredible 32 fouettés in
Odile’s solo of Act III.
The chemistry and
partner work between
Hernández and Dronina,
whilst lacking in places at
the start, grew throughout,
successfully conveying
the tragic ending of Swan
Lake.
Whilst not quite a
Moscow performance,
certainly a fantastic
English ballet. Overall, a
delightful performance.

A wonderful start to the new year with this traditional Swan Lake by the English National Ballet.
“Tchaikovsky’s
wonderfully
written score
was beautifully
conducted
by Gavin
Sutherland”
During the prologue,
showing Rothbart first
transforming Odette into
a swan. A lovely piece
of stage magic was used
during the “transforma-
tion”, with the change to
swan, Odette was instan-
taneously revealed from
behind Rothbart’s cape.
