Hot flash - Centrefold to be stripped down
HANGMAN
Negafelix kicks off
2019 with an exposé:
Felix centrefold to
contain full frontal
nudity!
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
N
egafelix can
confirm that
the centrefold
will hence-
forth contain fully nude
photographs, following
an onslaught of irate
e-mails from blue-balled
students.
The uproar came
following the publication
of Kinky Klub in the
Khristmas edition of
the newspaper (‘Felix
Navidad’, 2018), in which
suggestive simulation of
various kinks by partici-
pants were semi-censored,
simultaneously evoking
and choking repressed
yearnings in many
amongst the student body.
“Listen here you fat
pricks,” an e-mail from
one Bamish Heck, 3rd
and
a ½ year physics student,
reads, “I’ve gone through
shit this break. I’ve eaten
my five-a-day, spent time
with family, laid off drugs,
and even gone to bed at
ten o’clock every day
for three weeks. I don’t
even scream ‘yeet’ when
orgasming anymore. I
can’t live this wholesome
life no more - I demand
full frontal nudity! Stop
covering the goods!” This
was followed by several
fairly explicit sexual
threats (many of which
several members of the
NegaFelix team are not
opposed to engaging).
Members of the Kinky
Klub were understandably
in shock on hearing of
the requests. “Wait, are
you for real?,” exclaimed
Xanax Taken, Chair and
founding member of the
society, “I was honestly
just messing about when
I suggested we start this
up – didn’t realise so
many people were eager
to bust a nut…wait no
never mind I did. Looks
like my milkshake does
bring all the boys to the
yard, huh?”
The announcement
comes as Imperial comes
third from the bottom in
the list of “most sexu-
ally satisfied students”,
according to National
Student Sex Survey
(NSSS) polling, narrowly
beating out Cambridge
and the London School of
Tropical Medicine. “This
is an absolute disgrace,”
exclaimed Nikki Feel,
Deputy President (Gelled
Hair). “If all it takes
for this sorry lot to stop
moping around the library
café looking like a hoard
of zombies are some tits
and balls, then it’s about
damn time!”
It was expected that
this would be met with

considerable opposition
from the Communications
team within the College,
however NegaFelix has
received nothing but over-
whelming support from
the College. An informant
within the Fortress of
Solitude, also colloquially
known as the Faculty
Building, noted that Alice
Gast rubbed her hands
with glee and the news,
saying, “this is the perfect
distraction for those
horny bastards! Quickly
Lucinda, prep the private
jet – I have an oilfield to
get to!”

College Overlord
Janice Fast puts in
her two cents (oops,
no that’s too much
money) on how
Imperial plans to turn
the Blue Cube green in
2019

e l c o m e
b a c k ,
my loyal
s u b j e c t s ,
to another year in your
personal hell, and my
private heaven. I know
many of you are current-
ly taking January exams;
I hear your cries from
my penthouse office in
the Faculty Building.
Cheer up; it could be
worse (don’t tempt me
though)!
As many of you already
know, a core part of our
mission as an adminis-
tration is improving (my)
life on campus. We’ve
recently paid for an in-
dependent consultant to
consider areas of change
to make the College green
this year. I The consultant
recommended some great
areas for change, which I
propose to you here:
1) We’re reconsid-
ering an overhaul of the
personal tutorial system.
Why waste tutors so?
Academics are a finite
resource; think of the
children! That cannot
possibly be good for the
environment. How about
30 people per tutor group?
Savings! (for the planet)
2) The new air-con-
ditioning in the library
seems to be doing you all
a lot of good. In the in-
terests of global warming
(and to save on heating)
we’re leaving it on 24/7
this year.
3) Oil spills are such
a waste of money. They’re
also not that great for the
environment. Both of
these go against our core
values – so why waste
perfectly good oil when
we could just recycle it for
use in Fusion? Crude oil is
full of naturally occurring
hydrocarbons, you know
– it’s practically vegan!
4) Speaking of oil,
our good friends over
at Shell have pledged
to donate a sizeable
amount of funds towards
the administration to
‘help improve services’.
Everything we do is for
you!
5) It’s nice we’re
signing up for the Race
Equality Charter, but
it’s pretty costly. For the
environment, that is – all
that paperwork cannot
possibly be good for
those indigenous people
in Patagonia. Surely it
would make more sense
just to scrap the whole
thing? (We do take racism
seriously though; we have
black professors)
6) We’ve decided
there are too many of you
home undergrads paying
these cheap fees. Hence
we’ve decided to cull
the entire Earth Science
department. We all have
to sacrifice for the greater
good.
7) Oh, we’re raising
your fees again. Green
Imperial!
Always eager to hear
your thoughts about this
(though we will be putting
these through); my office
is on the top floor (a.k.a
not-on-your level) of the
Faculty Building.

7 ways Imperial will stay firmly in the green in 2019
You attend an ethics
event organised by
Shell. You never realised
just how fun conning
fishermen out of their
futures could be.
You’re Deputy President
(Finance & Services).
How can you save
money? Sell leftover
Farmer’s market
vegetables and market
them as premium vegan?
Score!
You go to the beauty
parlor. You feel out of
place.
Turns out you’re no
longer used to being
around so many other
women.
Is this how incels feel?
You can finally breathe
easy as student finance
delivers you from the pit
that is overdraft.
Not for long though; rent
is due.
You decide to go on a
quick weekend trip to
Vienna.
Unfortunately DroneSoc
decide to have a little
social outing in the
countryside.
You’re Alice Gast. Listen,
2019 is your year to
secure the bag. Finesse
them oil companies, sis.
You’re President of
VegSoc.
Meat Free Mondays are a
fantastic idea - shame the
food’s shite.
You’re stunting with your
new AirPods, eating sushi
and shit. Don’t try and
act like you don’t shop at
Lidl like the rest of us.
You have a moment of
clarity in the middle of
your exam.
Fuck, you’ve forgotten to
take the bins out.
Your boyfriend gives you
a late Christmas present:
chlamydia.
You decide to support
Theresa May’s Brexit
deal.
In the renegotiations,
the only thing all
parties agree on is your
deportation.
