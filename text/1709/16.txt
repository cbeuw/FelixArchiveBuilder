Fahrenheit 11/9 Review
A
s with all
M i c h a e l
Moore’s films
F a h r e n h e i t
11/9 (not 9/11, that’s his
other one) is one of the
most eye-opening films of
the year, and one I think
more of us should see. The
film opens with celebrities
and news hosts from
the run-up to the 2016
election joking about how
Trump would never be
president, but we have
time’s greatest gift on our
side, hindsight, and I slide
down in my seat, knowing
the true outcome and how
wrong all these smiling
and joking ‘experts’ were.
If you haven’t seen
any of his films, Michael
Moore does a wonderful
job of telling a side of the
story from a perspective
you rarely see, and in this
case, there are too many
stories to count. This
film, like all of his others,
starts with an outcome
we all know; like the
financial crisis of 2008 in
Capitalism: A Love Story,
and in this film the shock
victory of Donald J Trump
beating Hillary Clinton to
the White House. At this
point I was comfortably
lying on my sofa as I knew
what had happened (we
all do), but then Michael
Moore reaches a hand out
of the TV to check that
you’re still awake and
watching by dropping a
bomb shell on you. In this
instance he doesn’t blame
Russia or a rigged voting
system, which is what we
would all be expecting
for the result of 11/9. No,
he blames Gwen Stefani
(yeah, that woman off The
Voice) for the election of
the 45th president. This
is explained in a slightly
twisted but humorous way
by Moore as he speaks
over B roll footage from
Trump announcing his
campaign and actors
cheering Trump on.
These unexpected reveals
keep hitting home hard
throughout the film give
a different perspective on
the political environment
in the US to what you are
used to.
Throughout the film
Moore keeps you on
the edge of your seat by
revealing information to
you, that in hindsight, we
should all know about by
now. Maybe I’m naive,
and maybe you’re more
up to date with North
American politics than
me, but I don’t think the
general public know a lot
about how manipulative
the democrats were in the
runup to the 2016 election.
The twisted nature of the
political landscape, on
both the left and the right
is revealed, but not just
in the past decade, going
back to the 1990’s and
how politicians use their
power for ‘the good of the
people’ to keep their party
in power. This is an under-
lying theme of the film.

North American politics and Gwen Stefani.

Fear not, however, as
Moore makes you laugh
throughout, be it at our
own stupidity, or by him
trying to arrest numerous
members of the govern-
ment for poisoning over
10,000 children (yeah, that
happened, I had no idea,
did you?). There are so
many topics talked about
in this film that it would
take me days to present it
all, which makes the film
all the more impressive,
as he fits it all into 120
minutes. If you want an
eye widening experience
of a part of the USA’s po-
litical landscape over the
past 20-30 years, I urge
you to get some popcorn
and watch Fahrenheit
11/9, or Fahrenheit 9/11
for that matter, but that
one is all about blowing
people up, oil and good
old fashioned greed.
