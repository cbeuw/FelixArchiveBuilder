Universities risk a
credit crunch in bid to
compete for students

mperial President
Alice Gast has been
named as one of the
highest paid univer-
sity heads in the country.
The disclosure came
shortly before it was
revealed that Imperial
has more than doubled
its borrowing, giving it
the largest debt of any
British university.
Professor Gast receives
a salary of £433,000,
according to the College’s
latest remuneration dec-
laration, and reported in
the Financial Times last
month. She also collects
deferred compensation
of $375,000 (just over
£294,000) each year in
her capacity as director
of multinational energy
company Chevron, in
addition to $10,000 from
the Singapore Academic
Research Council, and
more than £9,000 from
the UK Research and
Innovation Board. This
latter amount was donated
to the College, which
claims to have received
£50,000 in donations from
Professor Gast in the past
financial year.
The disclosures in-
cluded more detail than
is required by regulatory
standards. “Transparency
is welcome,” Professor
Gast said.
“I’m surprised by all
the focus on money. I
do my job because I’m
passionate about it, she
added.
Universities have re-
cently come under fire for
excessive vice-chancellor
pay, sparked by the news
that the former vice-chan-
cellor of Bath University,
Dame Glynis Breakwell,
received a salary of
£479,000. Imperial’s
remuneration committee,
which approved Professor
Gast’s salary, justified
the amount, saying it was
“appropriate given the
size, profile, and impact of
the work of the College”.
On top of her annual
income, Professor Gast
has an official residence
on Queen’s Gate worth
£120,000 each year. As
Felix has previously
revealed, Professor
Gast’s expenses are also
among the highest in the
country. In the past year,
Professor Gast claimed
almost £44,000 — more
than the median salary for
Imperial employees. Most
of these expenses related
to overseas travel, with
the remainder claimed for
taxis, gifts, and hospitali-
ty. The average expenses
claim for Russell Group
vice-chancellors over the
same period was less than
£10,000.
the College has the
largest loans of all higher
education institutions in
the country, according to
a Times report using data
from the Higher Educa-
tion Statistics Agency.
Group universities have
dropped by 3% this year.
Masters’ degrees numbers
have decreased by 5% and
there has been a fall of 9%
in terms of PhD students.

the Office for Students, Sir
Michael Barber has stated
that the body will not use
public funds to provide
bailouts for universities
facing bankruptcy.
Financial pressure
was cited as one of the
reasons that universities
were reluctant to continue
with the current pensions
system, which led to
industrial action disrupt-
ing education across the
country. As Felix has
previously revealed, the
College admitted to repre-
sentatives of the Universi-
ty and College Union that
it could afford to maintain
its pensions contributions
but had decided against
doing so.

At the same time, Im-
perial more than doubled
its borrowing, taking it
from £207 million in
2015/16 to £471 million
in 2016/17. This means
Some of the money was
used to fund the College’s
expansion developments
in White City. Following
the opening of the Mo-
lecular Sciences Research
Hub last autumn, Felix
noted a series of com-
plaints from members of
the Department of Chem-
istry, which is now based
at the White City campus.
The emerging problems
included two floors of the
building being incom-
plete because “the whole
project overran”, and
facilities not working, in
part because the building
had been designed to a
‘one size fits all’ specifi-
cation, resulting in labs
requiring modifications.

The university sector
now has debts totalling
£10.8 billion. Higher
education faces “unprece-
dented uncertainty” in the
coming years, with Brexit
and demographic changes
threatening a drop in
student numbers, and po-
tential changes to tuition
fees, which represent most
universities’ main source
of income. Numbers of
