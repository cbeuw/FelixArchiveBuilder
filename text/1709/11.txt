True West: Engaging, absurd The Tragedy of King
Richard the Second
T
he West End
debut of the 1980
play is the first
major revival
of Sam Shepherd’s work
since his death last year.
The two main leads pro-
vide a meaty role for any
actor, with talents such as
John Malkovich and Gary
Sinise, Philip Seymour
Hoffman and John C
Reilly, and Mark Rylance
alternating the roles with
Michael Rudko, each
trying their hand to play
the hardly fraternal,
warring brothers. With
Game of Thrones star Kit
Harington and actor-mu-
sician Johnny Flynn
portraying Austin and Lee
respectively, we see the
portrait of two brothers,
which could be said to be
more of a bifurcation of
the playwright himself,
and their own warped
versions of the fading
American dream.
Harington plays against
type as Austin, an Ivy-
League educated screen-
writer, who is housesitting
for his mother in her
Southern Californian
home. The arrival of Lee,
played with menacing
prowess by Flynn, after
five years of absence
and three months in the
Mojave desert, disrupts
the neurotic Lee and old
arguments resume.
The first act belongs
to Flynn, whose looming
height, harsh drawl and
deliberate movements
bring an ominous air to
the estranged Lee. His
casual monologue on
how most murders occur
within the family reveals
a feral underbelly, where
his time spent in the desert
has changed him for the
worst. Lee then steals the
limelight from Austin and
plays to producer Saul’s
gullibility, with a “true
Western story”.
mantle of the petty thief.
This act belongs to Har-
ington, with an outrageous
number of toasters lining
the stage in his attempt to
prove his skill, resulting in
a petering tower of toast
and a furious Lee. Har-
ington’s comedic timing
was a delightful surprise,
with his degeneration
T
here has not
been a more
appropriate time
to perform The
Tragedy of King Richard
the Second. When else in
modern British political
history have questions of
leadership, the right to
rule and the role of gov-
ernance been drawn more
into question than now?
When the excellent
Simon Russell Beale,
transfigured into Richard
in the tight atmosphere of
the Almeida, pronounces
those famed syllables
“Not all the water in
the rough rude sea Can
wash the balm off from
an anointed king”, how
can one not think of the
tunnel-visioned Brex-
iteers and their refusal to
contemplate a people’s
vote? How can one not
think of the arrogant
incompetence of the
Tory party at this time of
national turmoil (after all
what is ‘the natural party
of government’ other than
a reformulation of the
divine right of kings)?
Yet, what we are presented
under the direction of Joe
Hill-Gibbins is a defen-
sive formation that does
not give itself the room
to explore such themes.
Think Shakespeare in the
form of a polite appear-
ance at a Christmas party:
we go briefly, act charm-
ingly, and leave as soon as
is socially acceptable.
Hill-Gibbins’ pro-
duction is to modern
Shakespeare performance
what minimal is to
techno, stripped back. The
washed, concrete stage
and strip lighting is only
a smoke machine away
from being a tucked away
room at Berlin’s Tresor
night club. It is a small
eight person ensemble
that don the stage for the
brief 140 minute straight
through run time.
simplicity is that each
word and tone of voice is
given the complete stage:
when the spotlight is on
Beale as Richard, it is
really on Beale as Richard.
This leads to certain dev-
astating moments where
the words of the Bard ring
true and have you aching
to ask that they pause,
rewind and repeat the line
over and over. Beyond
the line delivery, even the
minimal stage props make
their impact, watching
Beale drowned and
humiliated in earth and
water under a neon gaze
is hard to top in terms of
dramatic experience.
Of course, the counter
to the above is that the
room feels very empty
when the space for ex-
ploration is not taken up.
The case in point being
Leo Bill as Bolingbroke
who sometimes feels as
far away as his fictional
counterpart in exile. And
it is here that one leaves
the theatre wishing more
had been said on the
themes that are begging to
be spoken about. Without
this, the cast are given
a heavy burden which,
admittedly, they do make
an impressive attempt of
bearing.

The set, wonky and

by Jon Bauser, is at the

furniture and people alike
thrown about with an

Austin attempts to strangle
Lee with a whipcord adds
the element of the absurd.

From my understand-
ing of the playwright, his
plays do not always make
sense, focusing on mood
and emotion, rather than
structured storytelling.
The play itself feels like
a collection of offbeat
scenes, harshly cut with

shock you out of the story.

outrageous moments
between the two leads
