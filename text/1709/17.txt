n 24th
October,
the Imperial
College Food
Festival took
place on Queen’s Lawn,
featuring a diverse range
of food stalls including
London Smokehouse,
Nick and Greek,
Wafflestick and Coconut
Tree. The fundraiser was
part of the international
Charity Week campaign
held on campus, and
raised a whopping sum of
over £1,000 for sustaina-
bly developing resources
for children in need. It was
also nominated as one of
the best events in London
– score!
With the sun rising and
the sky a brilliant blue,
food vendors from across
London set up on Queen’s
Lawn on the morning of
the 24th. Coordinated
by Azmat Habibullah,
Anisah Hakim and their
team of volunteers from
Islamic Society, they were
soon ready and waiting
for the first hungry
students to emerge from
their lectures. Despite a
slow start (let’s be real,
the 9ams probably didn’t
have great attendance
rates), the stream of
customers spiked after
midday and did not stop.
London Smokehouse
sold out almost two hours
early, and had to turn
away further customers,
commenting “This is
better than a standard
day’s trading at our
King’s Cross market, and
we’d love to come every
month!”. Alongside the
steak, Thai and Greek
food, Imperial’s very
own Bruneian Society ran
a stall, giving people a
taste of ethnic delicacies.

and ECG machines, the
Charity Week campaign
additionally spends the
money on training staff
to use the machines and
to fix the equipment when
needed. The aim is not
merely to help children in
need, but to lift them out
of poverty for good. This
year, over £1.3 million
was raised during Charity
Week around the world.
Recent projects include
providing psychological
support for children in the
Central African Republic
affected by conflict, and
rebuilding seven schools
in war-torn Gaza.
The food festival was
but one aspect of a wider
Imperial Islamic Society
campaign for Charity
Week. The society raised
£39,000 in total, through
a wide range of events
including the esteemed
Annual Charity Dinner,
held at a London hotel,
a sponsored climb of
Mount Snowdonia by
over 40 students, and
a football tournament.
More informally, several
students volunteered to
sell Krispy Kreme dough-
nuts and chicken wings
around campus to raise
more money towards the
Charity Week cause.
a society to host a large
event on Queen’s Lawn.
If you are interested in
running a similar event
in the future, we highly
encourage you to contact
Azmat for details on how
to go about it! Further-
more, anyone interested in
taking part in next year’s
Charity Week campaign
should message the
Imperial College Charity
Week page on Facebook,
and the committee will
be in touch with further
details. Use some of your
spare October time before
the deadlines rush in food
a good cause!
Overall, the Food
Festival was a resounding
success as part of a much
broader Charity Week,
and hopefully the first of
many future charity food
festivals held at Imperial.
Because food + money
for a good cause = what
more could you want?

Charity Week is a
worldwide fundraising
campaign, coordinated
by Islamic Relief, in
which over 70 universities
participate. The goal is to
help not just individuals,
but communities, by
sustainably developing
infrastructure which will
have a ripple effect in
benefitting a society for
generations. By focusing
on improving key infra-
structure around impover-
ished areas of the globe, it
takes a holistic approach
to improving wellbeing.
For instance, whilst many
charities focus on buying
new equipment for hos-
pitals, such as monitors

This was the first time
that the Food Festival
had successfully run,
following three years of
attempts resulting in dis-
appointment. However,
this year, after mounds of
paperwork, the College
approved the event in time
– resulting in the first time
the college has allowed
