A power shift?
The digital transformation in the oil industry

O
nce upon a
time, around
30 years ago,
the oil industry
was at the forefront of
technological innovation,
pushing boundaries with
creations borne out of
necessity, such as digital
well logs, electrical sub-
mersible pumps and 3D
seismic imaging tools,
which use sound waves
to create a 3D image of
geological formations.
In years following, the
focus shifted. As oil prices
skyrocketed in 2011, the
aim became maximizing
production and, in relative
terms, technology took a
backseat . However, with
oil prices currently at $72/
barrel , the narrative has
shifted again. The players
in this tumultuous market
have started looking to
new technologies, driven
by the need to become
more efficient in order to
remain profitable. But as
companies embark on this
digital transformation, a
natural question emerges:
How will this affect the
people working there? Is
power being transferred
from the people to the
latest technology?
An example of the in-
dustry’s latest endeavour
to embrace technology
is BP’s partnership
with Beyond Limits, an
American artificial intel-
ligence company based
in Los Angeles. The aim
is to utilise cognitive
artificial intelligence (AI),
a system that uses models
to simulate human rea-
soning when faced with
complex problems by
‘learning’ how geologists
and petroleum engineers
think; it then mimics their
approach when faced
with challenges. The
benefits are huge – AI can
catalogue unused ideas
from discussions between
engineers, it can bring
up relevant suggestions
when a problem needs to
be solved quickly and,
because it has been trained
by experts (who will at
some point retire), it can
digitally store their knowl-
edge and expertise for the
benefit of future genera-
tions. Does this mean that
fewer engineers will be
needed in the upstream
sector in the future?
According to the Journal
of Petroleum Technology,
“many analysts do not
see the mass replacement
of human engineering
talent on the immediate
horizon.” This perhaps
implies that although the
transfer of power from
people to technology is
not happening right now, it
will inevitably become the
reality of the future. The
graph shows that, post-oil
price collapse, the number
of oil rigs has increased
substantially again, a
trend not entirely echoed
by industry employment
figures. Meanwhile, the
production figures show
a near-steady increase.
Thus, a conclusion that
one can perhaps draw
from this is that digital
transformation has already
had some impact in terms
of productivity and effi-
ciency on the oil industry;
clearly, higher production
levels are being achieved
by a smaller workforce.
However, the CEO of
Beyond Limits puts
forward a different per-
spective: “We are creating
a collaboration between
man and machine”, he
says, “to amplify human
talent”. Perhaps one could
then view this shift not as
power to the people, but
as the sharing of power
between people and tech-
nology.
Anadarko is another
company undergoing a
technological transfor-
mation; it now employs
almost 20 data scientists
in its Advanced Analytics
and Emerging Technolo-
giesgroup.Othermembers
include geoscience and
engineering experts. The
advantage of such a col-
laboration is immediately
obvious – it increases
knowledge across all
disciplines and promotes
creativity. The team aims
to test new concepts and
accelerate technological
development to enhance
“competitive advantage
in the exploration and
production space” . An
example of such a project
is the integrated produc-
tion surveillance and
optimisation platform,
IPSO. IPSO, which
breaks down and filters
data like pressure and
temperature changes in
wells into digestible and
easy-to-monitor bits, was
an unprecedented success
when it was deployed for
use in the Gulf of Mexico;
it was fully operational
97% of the time in the first
6 months . To continue
such breakthroughs,
more data scientists are
needed, yet the Journal
of Petroleum Technology
comments that “the
upstream industry has
openly acknowledged in
recent years that it is not
the most attractive sector
for data scientists” . Thus,
it seems that emerging
technologies can play a
role in encouraging such
recruitment and multi-
disciplinary teamwork, a
sure sign that power still
remains with the people.
platforms has many more
benefits than just elimi-
nating health and safety
concerns; labour costs are
drastically reduced and
other costs such as heli-
copter use are eliminated.
To reduce these ‘ineffi-
ciencies’, technologies
such as the Iron Rough-
neck have been rolled out.
This connects drill pipe
segments, a dangerous and
repetitive task previously
done by hand. Drones can
collect data in five days;
it takes rope-access tech-
nicians about eight weeks
to undertake the same
amount of work . So, what
happens to the workers
when these powers are
transferred from people
to automation? It’s es-
timated that automated
drilling rigs could reduce
the workforce on a rig by
up to 40% in the future.
However Chris Robart,
Ambyint’s president of
US Operations takes a
different view: “We are
freeing up individuals to
go do other things, like
think about new technol-
ogy, troubleshoot failed
equipment, deal with
workovers, or new well
designs.” Clearly, these
new tasks require a com-

pletely different skillset to
the labour-intensive jobs
that AI and automation
are replacing.
From Iron roughnecks
to drones to the applica-
tions ofAI, the oil industry
has certainly embraced
this era of technology,
focusing on increasing
efficiency and improving
safety. This additional
power to technology
though, comes with addi-
tional costs to the people
of the workforce. For
the foreseeable future at
least, oil rigs will not all
become fully automated.
But we are witnessing
the birth of shared power,
as machines become in-
creasingly better at tasks
humans were employed to
do. Where this power shift
leads the oil industry, only
time will tell.
