Why “Supervision Stories”?
O
n 7th
December
2018, we pub-
lished our first
s u p e r v i s i o n
story (together with the
first ever postgraduate
focused content in Felix!).
The reaction from students
and staff at the College
was polarised, spanning
from enthusiastic support
to harsh criticism. While
one brave ex-Imperial
student took the courage
to speak up first, we are
still looking forward to
reading the other 3480
supervision stories de-
scribing the life of our PG
Research students!
Critical voices refer to
the national Postgraduate
Research Experience
Survey (PRES) where
Imperial College students
showed a satisfaction rate
of 83% with their current
supervision. The partici-
pation rate was quite high,
at 59%. For many people,
this number, which is
slightly below national
average, seems to be sat-
isfactory enough to lean
back in their chairs and
defend that Imperial does
a good job in managing
their supervision perfor-
mance.
But wait a minute.
As one of the few social
scientists around College,
I have concerns with the
nature of questions and
the conclusions we draw
from the PRES. While the
survey evaluates general
satisfaction, the skills and
knowledge of the supervi-
sor and training needs, the
PRES does not address
any questions related to
well-being and mental
health.
mental health crisis.
Together with a group of
nine other universities, in
2018, Imperial College
participated in the Vi-
tae-led research project
“Exploring Well-being
and Mental Health andAs-
sociated Support Services
for PG Researchers”. The
report was very clear in
stating that “the quality
of the student-supervisor
relationship is central to
the student experience
and hence, often central to
their well-being.”
The report further
states:
“There was consensus
across staff interviews
and student focus groups
that difficulty in the su-
pervisory relationship was
one of the most common
reasons for well-being
issues, often exacerbated
by imposter syndrome
[a psychological pattern
in which an individual
doubts their accomplish-
ments and has a persistent
internalized fear of being
exposed as a ‘fraud’].
Professional support
services staff particularly
commented that it was
one of the most difficult
circumstances to deal
with, not least as PGRs
were usually reluctant to
give them permission to
approach the supervisor.
Academic and support
staff felt that there was
general reluctance within
universities to tackle dif-
ficult supervisory issues”.
The report mentions that
students experience fear
of complaining, perceiv-
ing themselves as being in
a powerless position. Only
42% of students agreed
that they would feel com-
fortable in talking to their
supervisor about mental
health issues, while 45%
disagreed; women being
even less likely to talk to
their tutors than men.
With “supervision
stories” we are creating
a channel for us and the
College to hear what is
going on inside of labs
and offices, without fear,
without filter. It is also a
way to inspire students
with problems to reach
out for help through the
constantly improving
Imperial College welfare
system and, eventually,
resolve their problems
and receive the PhD
experience they deserve.
So, dear students, please
share your stories!
A new PhD community? Yes, please.
D
espite having
beenatImperial
for three years,
adjusting to
PhD life brought its own
new challenges, both
academic and in terms
of maintaining work-life
balance, managing my
motivation and mental
health and finding time to
devote to exercise. At the
start, when I knew literal-
ly no one, I wished I had
a way of finding support
and friends in the wider
PhD community. I wanted
to meet people who have
been at this point before
and have had to adjust
their approach to become
effective in their research.
Unfortunately, the lack of
community spirit not just
in the PhD circle but at
Imperial as a whole means
that its research students,
who are responsible for a
significant portion of the
academic output of the
college, are suffering in
silence. Struggling with
motivation, mental health
and resilience are no new
problems to PhD students;
a ‘part of the job’ some
might argue. But your
Graduate Students’ Union
(GSU) is here to support
you to have the most en-
joyable and effective time
at Imperial. We want to
build a community of PhD
students which is collabo-
rative and supportive in all
aspects of PhD life. I was
keen to get involved and
help build this community
but, at the moment, it’s a
bit of an uphill battle.
Before the Christmas
break, about five of
your elected PhD repre-
sentatives. a sadly low
number (although we did
get extra pizza, mince
pies and mulled wine),
met to discuss some of
the big problems facing
PhD students. Apart
from spending almost
20 minutes complaining
about how we are all
slowly freezing to ice
cubes in our labs and
offices – which the GSU
president has agreed
to raise further – over-
whelmingly it was agreed
that building a college
community where PhD
students between facul-
ties can meet, interact,
make friends or even
more (speed dating was
even suggested) would
make for a more positive
atmosphere! The GSU
are working hard to
promote cross-faculty
interaction, so watch out
for information about
‘GSU Connect’ and ‘GSU
Black Tie Event’ all to
come in the new year. For
those of you in the Faculty
of Natural Sciences and
looking for a New Year’s
resolution which will
improve your mental and
physical health, consider
joining me and the faculty
running club: we meet
outside SAF at 5:30pm
every Tuesday (and ulti-
mately end up in H-Bar).
Your GSU is here for you
so, if there are any sug-
gestions you have, talk to
your PhD representative
or Academic and Welfare
Officers for your faculties.
Multiple faculties are
struggling with open
discussions about both
positive and poor super-
vision of PhD students.
The GSU is looking to
hear from its students
so we can share good
supervision practice with
the Graduate School and
College. One problem we
discussed was the feeling
in multiple departments
that PhD students are
underprepared for super-
vision of undergraduate or
Masters project students;
we suggested that college
should make it mandatory
for supervisors to inform
PhD students well in
advance when they have
to supervise a project
student. Also, we figured
that it would be good to
have access to additional
training for PhD students
by the Graduate School
who have to supervise.
As we look into the new
year it is also a good time
to remind all members of
our community about the
mental health support on
offer; Imperial College
Counselling Service,
Union Advice Centre
and Imperial College
Health Centre are all
offering services open
to all students. Every
department has qualified
Mental Health First
Aiders which can be
identified by their green
lanyards. The Chaplaincy
also offers courses in
mindfulness and tea, cake
and chat, exclusively for
PhD students, happening
once a month from 12.30-
14.00 (the next one is 24th
January).
We hope to see you
at some of our events
this term and encourage
everyone to get involved
in the Imperial Commu-
nity!
