eXistenZ * * * •
Starring : Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm, Christopher Eccleston
Director: David Cronenberg
A
fter t h e over-indulgent, barely-
releaseable fetish-fest that w a s
Crash, H o l l y w o o d d e c i d e d that
they'd bankrolled David C r o n e n b e r g ' s
warped dreams for long-enough, a n d
d r o p p e d h i m as fast as possible. After
all, all his best w o r k - The Fly,
Videodrome a n d Scanners - w a s pro-
duced well over t e n years a g o , a n d
since then he's consistently b e e n loos-
ing m o n e y a n d raking in s o m e very b a d
publicity. C o n s e q u e n t l y , eXistenZ
c o m e s to y o u courtesy o f a d o z e n dif-
ferent arts funds a n d 'Natural Nylon
Entertainment' whatever that might b e .
Suffice to say, it's not exactly t h e most
awe-inspiring set o f o p e n i n g credits
you've ever s e e n . T h e film hasn't e v e n
started, a n d you're already fearing the
worst...
...but w i t h i n five m i n u t e s y o u ' r e
h o o k e d . eXistenZ is p r o b a b l y just a s
weird as a n y o f his other work, but Cro-
nenberg has recaptured the accessibility
that's essential If y o u w a n t t o tell a story
like this to a n o n sci-fi a u d i e n c e . C o n s e -
quently a story a b o u t g a m e s r u n b y
attaching genetically created ' p o d s ' into
'bioports' situated in t h e base o f players
Jennifer Jason Leigh is the future ofDoC students? Sadly, I don't think so.
spines doesn't c o m e across as nearly as
idiotic as it u n d o u b t e d l y does from that
single-sentence d e s c r i p t i o n . Anyway,
n o n e o f that's really important, as it's
actually a simultaneously scary and funny
look at t h e future o f h u m a n i t y in a n
increasingly technological world. Para-
n o i a a n d techno-fear a b o u n d , a s the
divisions b e t w e e n fantasy a n d reality
b e c o m e blurred - d e s p i t e game-play
strangely reminiscent of the C o m m o d o r e
64 (you have to say o n e specific line o f
d i a l o g u e , o t h e r w i s e t h e characters
b e c o m e stuck in a loop). The only d o w n -
side is that in his quest for mass appeal
he clearly feels c o m p e l l e d to m a k e t h e
m e s s a g e blindingly clear, a n d c o n s e -
quently it won't take a PhD in Film to spot
the point h e ' s trying to drive h o m e .
The reason it succeeds, however, is
C r o n e n b e r g ' s sensible decision not t o
blind us with t o o m u c h techno-babble.
Instead, w e ' r e carried a l o n g by his abil-
ity to tell a story o n a variety o f levels -
i n d e e d this is as m u c h an old-fashioned
love story (boy and girl brought together
o n the run, s e e m i n g l y with nothing in
c o m m o n , have to protect each other...)
as sci-fi or fantasy. H e ' s ably assisted in
this task by the stars, with Jason Leigh in
particular b o u n c i n g back f r o m s o m e
a p p a l i n g roles to t h e kind o f sexy, e m o -
tive form that brought her t o stardom
(The Hudsucker Proxy a n d Single White
Female).
Strange it u n d o u b t e d l y is n o n e t h e -
less, a n d if you're not prepared to b e
w i n c i n g o n e m i n u t e a n d laughing the
next, eXistenZ w o n ' t b e for y o u . H o w -
ever, if y o u accept that C r o n e n b e r g sim-
ply uses w e i r d n e s s as a tool t o tell a
story in a n e n g a g i n g w a y , you'll b e
rewarded with o n e o f t h e most thought
provoking movies o f the year. A definite
must for D o C students in n e e d o f moral
guidance.Q

The Waterboy * * * •
Starring : Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates, Henry Winkler, Fairuza Balk
Director: Frank Coraci
The Deep South.- the land that fashion forgot.
T
here are those a m o n g s t us w h o
b e m o a n t h e triumph o f lowest-
c o m m o n d e n o m i n a t o r c o m e d y as
the "death o f m o d e r n culture", a n d until
last s u m m e r , I w a s a m o n g s t t h e m .
M o v i e s like Kingpin a n d Dumb &
Dumber have very little g o i n g for t h e m
besides a n endless succession o f t h e
kind of gags that m a k e Carry On films
look cultured. Last s u m m e r , however, I
saw There's Something About Mary'and
my faith w a s restored, simply b e c a u s e it
was s o G o d d a m n funny. Thankfully,
The Waterboy c o n t i n u e s t h e t r e n d ,
proving that it's possible t o m a k e a
movie brilliantly funny despite the fact
that it expects y o u to leave your brain at
the door.
It's a n out a n d out A d a m Sandler
vehicle (sadly Winkler a n d Balk aren't
given e n o u g h screen time to m a k e a n
impact), a n d it's a credit t o his c o m e d i c
versatility that h e m a n a g e s to m a k e his
entirely two-dimensional character into a
likeable hero. H e plays Bobby Boucher,
a cliche-ridden southern idiot - a 31 year
old w h o still lives with his mother (and
her horse), idolises professional wrestlers,
never w e n t to High School a n d hits the
peak o f his career as a waterboy for a
lowly College t e a m . O r so it w o u l d s e e m
unlil he hitches u p with Winkler's inept
squad, a n d finds his true calling as t h e
greatest Linebacker in history.
Sure, it's hideously sterotypyed, pre-
dictable a n d obvious - but it's incredibly
entertaining nonetheless. You really root
for Sandler, as the m o d e r n equivalent of
the A m e r i c an D r e a m T p o o r . not particu-
larly bright b o y b e c o m e s a celebrity
through sport), a n d he rewards with great
comic timing and s o m e top-drawer gags.
Thankfully for prospective UK audi-
e n c e s , t h e sports action requires n o
k n o w l e d g e o f t h e rules. Just accept that ,
every time Sandler hits s o m e o n e hard
(you'll k n o w they're hurt thanks to s o m e
unpleasant s o u n d effects) it's A G o o d
Thing, a n d it'll all m a k e sense. In fact, it's
his sporting prowess that provides the
most reliable gags, a n d every time the
story s e e m s to b e flagging, he'll put in
another hilariously effective tackle o n
the (increasingly petrified) quarterback.
Ultimately, The Waterboy is a one-joke
film - but it's a joke that's delivered in
e n o u g h different disguises to keep y o u
l a u g h i n g o u t l o u d for t h e regulation
ninety minutes. Q
