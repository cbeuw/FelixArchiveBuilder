Motorbikes eh? For those w h o like throw-
ing their legs r o u n d h u g e t h r o b b i n g
motors, the taste o f hospital f o o d a n d the
feel o f metal In very close contact with
their b o n e s - very very close contact.
Short o f v o l u n t e e r i n g for t h e British
m a n n e d space flight p r o g r a m t h o u g h
there are very f e w other w a y s to get to
go from 0-60 m p h in less than 5 s e c o n d s
on a budget o f less than t e n t h o u s a n d
p o u n d s (well there is always car jacking
but just for o n c e lets keep t o t h e straight
and narrow).
So with the fast, furious a n d exciting
action that bikes provide, w h y are there
so f e w g o o d motorcycle racing g a m e s
about? Sega had a winner at the arcades
with M a n x TT but not m a n y can afford a
full size arcade racer in t h e average stu-
dent flat. Perhaps the p r o b l e m is t h e
control m e t h o d . Car racers have their fill
of ready to run steering w h e e l s - f e e d -
back or n o feedback, but till n o w n o
o n e s e e m s willing to build a full size
replica ducati in plastic to lean
into t h e c o r n e r s a n d practice
those all important reverse steer-
n g m a n o e u v r e s . So with either

m o r e 'arcade a n d f u n ' like road-
rash rather than the more serious
car r a c i n g g a m e s like Gran
Tourismo.
EA t h o u g h has taken the risk
a n d tried t o p r o d u c e a m o r e g r o w n up
motorcycle g a m e . Based o n the m o r e
beefier superbike series rather than the
half litre 2 stroke m a d n e s s k n o w n as
G r a n d Prix bike racing, the g a m e e c h o e s
the Formula o n e style of car games rather
than t h e m o r e o p e n play o f the Gran
T o u r i s m o series, f o r this sin It m o r e than
c o m p e n s a t e s with a level of detail a n d
control w h i c h is just completely breath-
taking.
There is

also u s e f u l
for learning
h o w to han-
dle the bike, it is the p o p p o d o m

meal. The real fun begins w h e n the
simulation m o d e is c h o s e n .
Here y o u j u m p o n o n e of the
hottest bikes k n o w n to m a n a n d
attempt to race the thing against 4flfB
competition. T h e usual rounds c
practice, qualification a n d practice again
still figure in. there but the true angel
delight is h o w the bike handles. The abil-
ity to high a n d l o w side the bike - crash
in spectacular ways to those not in the
k n o w - is excellent; for o n c e a designer
has realised that a bike d o e s not f o l l o w
the s a m e h a n d l i n g physics as half a car.
O p e n the throttle up suddenly t o o s o o n
in a corner a n d the back w h e e l will loose
grip a n d those nice n e w leathers the
s p o n s o r s so kindly d o n a t e d s u d d e n l y

Start this g a m e o n a nice n e w fast

g r a p h i c s level
up to its highest
a n d y o u will
start to feel the
gravel rash

With the camera
a n g l e f r o m
either a b o v e or
just b e h i n d the
bike the quality
a n d s p e e d o f
the graphics is superb, but the best view-
ing, if not t h e most easy to control from,
is the helmet view. In this the h e a d b o b -
bles a b o u t w h e n c o r n e r i n g a n d it
b e c o m e s a fight not to start leaning into
the corners in sympathy.
The force f e e d b a c k joystick is also
catered for in this bikers h e a v e n a n d

settings d o w n to a m i n i m u m .
The motorcycle g a m e has, with EA
Superbike World C h a m p i o n s h i p , finally
g r o w n up. If only there w e r e p e o p l e to

sible to convert p e o p l e to the dangerous

g o i n g t o b e a favourite a m o n g that
crowd, presumably b e c a u s e o f the fact
that the g a m e relied o n driving o n the
right a n d they only did that w h i l e o n the
way d o w n to the Bordeaux holiday cot-
tage. Luckily for these p e o p l e the e x p a n -
sion pack GTA - L o n d o n , takes y o u a w a y
f r o m the r o u g h a n d t u m b l e o f t h e states

s w i n g i n g L o n d o n o f t h e 1960's. W h o
says things are getting m o r e violent.
Notice I said expansion pack. You still
n e e d the original to be installed o n t h e
PC to be able to play. T h o u g h with G T A
2 o n its way, s o m e o n e surely is just about
to relaunch t h e original version in b u d -
get format. Your extra m o n e y d o e s get
y o u a w h o l e multi-storey carpark o f n e w
cars t o steal, with scooters a n d m o p e d s
for the t w o w h e e l fiends. The n a m e s o f
these cars f o l l o w t h e original 'we don't

Jugular (Jaguar), n o w get m i x e d in with
the Crapi (Capri). While driving fast cars
t h r o u g h the streets o f L o n d o n is f u n ,
the destruction derby only really begins
w h e n r u n n i n g a m o k d r i v i n g a petrol
tanker, routemaster bus, or e v e n m o r e
f u n t h e o p e n t o p tourist b u s - a n d o n
your left is a c r u m p l e d fiat 500 a n d o n
the right is a police car attempting to road
block us.
The g a m e follows the same structure

sions a n d carjack your w a y

to the next level o f m o r e a n d m o r e dif-
ficult a n d interesting missions.
Did I mention mission? What I should
have said is j o b as in bank job, bloke j o b
even b o m b jobs (they might have s o m e -
t h i n g to d o with b l o w i n g things u p but
even these pages are not g o i n g to sink
to that level.). The g a m e structure might
well be the s a m e as GTA - US but the
jobs, the voices a n d the cut s e q u e n c e s
are all M i c h a e l Caine 1960's Film style
w i d e b o y . Even the police have d e v e l -
o p e d accents that w o u l d have sat rather
nicely b e t w e e n the frames o f the Italian
Job. A J o h n Barry soundtrack in the back-
g r o u n d w o u l d almost be t o o retro - a n d
perhaps thankfully there is the steady
stream o f 1960's radio style tracks that
a c c o m p a n y your crime
spree.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y as
m u c h as they h a v e
tried, this is a L o n d o n

the origi-

transformed t h e streets into a series of

north-south a n d east-west roads.
But h e y this is m a k e believe film
f o n d o n not t h e real place. In the real

g a n g l a n d killings in C h e l s e a u s i n g
