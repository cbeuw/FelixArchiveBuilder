10 May 1999 Editorial & Giveaway 5
Felix under Fire
I don't know - why do I bother? What
with the private housing office, non-
existent news (and no writers anyway),
and Dave Hellard's cautionary notes
(see Presidential feedback, page 7),
I've had just about e n o u g h of this
week. As for the first of those; some-
body's lying, be it student or staff, I
don't know. To be honest I'm not sure
how much I care. As for Mr Hellard, just
don't get me started on the fish tank.
May I advise all of you to only approach
me if you bring sacrificial Marlboro
(reds or lights).
Nothing was stirring...
...not a fucking sausage, as John
Cleeves once put it. Well, I guess you
lot can't be blamed - you've got years
to pass, finals to complete, city jobs to
get... Even outside IC there isn't a lot
happening; a few bombs here and
there, some tornadoes in the States...
oh, and some uninteresting war in a
remote part of Europe. All rather dull,
really.
Such is the exam season at IC, and
it can take its toll. It is absolutely vital to
your physical and mental well-being that
you leave SW7 at least once a week dur-
ing this period, and preferably get out of
London altogether. Try Camden on a
Saturday afternoon - it'll do you more
good than staring at soil mechanics
notes for another five hours.
I have found the ultimate in exam
distraction activities, which is strange as
I don't have exams, film Lour. Unlike
Sky Film channels you don't feel guilty
watching it, because the films are actu-
ally worth watching. If you've got cable
and were considering getting it, be
warned - you'll need a stash of video
tapes and a programmable video
recorder, or else kiss that degree good-
bye.
Only Joking... or am I?
Well, that's the annual T hate this job,
I hate students, sod everything' edito-
rial out of the way. What do I mean?
Well, every job gets to you occasionally,
and sabbaticals are no exception. If
you have to write hundreds of words
each week for thirty odd issues, you
might as well use o n e of them to
denounce the world. M y predecessor
made the mistake of choosing the final
issue to vent his frustration, which was
unfortunate. I would hope to paint a
more cheerful picture with my last
words - the emphasis in that sentence
is definitely on 'hope'... - Ed
