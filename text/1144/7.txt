Medics Under Surveillance
Big Brother has been called into the BMS
to attempt to restore order to rowdy
medical lectures. Television cameras
installed in Lecture Theatre O n e in the
BMS building as part of the School of
Medicine's new Interactive video teach-
ing system have been found another
use. Sneaky staff are spying on the
wannabe doctors' behaviour during lec-
tures. This covert operation is the Med-
ical School's response to harmless but
childish behaviour of some of the
wannabe doctors. Medics are renowned
for their exuberant and flamboyant and
generally over the top reactions to lec-
tures, regularly applauding excellent lec-
tures, and explicitly ignoring boring ones.
Evidently the bigwigs in the medical
school on hearing of this have decided
to clamp down. Students have been
warned that the videos will be watched,
and perpetrators Identified if a lecturer
complains of "bad behaviour" during
their lectures. Kevin hopes that even
though this is only affecting first year
medics at the moment, the Medical
Union will strongly oppose this action.
Microsoft Megalomania
We can relax in the knowledge that every
single e-mail system in use here at the MIT
of Europe, is a lot bet-
ter than the archaic
text only e-mail system
available to students
at Oxford. The IC e-
mail system is under-
going a period of
change, with the trend
being towards the use
of Microsoft Exchange
servers, and Microsoft
Outlook. Some peo-
ple appear to be quite
happy to assist In
increasing Bill Gate's fortunes even more
by using Microsoft products. However
this view is far from universal, as within the
IC community we also have people who
object to the use of Outlook, people such
as Apple Mac evangelists like Kevin, pen-
guin lovers, and plain luddites - with a
fond attachment to PINE, all have under-
standable objections to this forced
change. The fact that the change has
been made by force is undeniable, Kevin
A Mostly Harmless Column by
Kevin, a random entity who
knows nothing about nothing
is aware of instances where students have
been issued with Outlook accounts, and
the CCS refuses to provide the necessary
information to allow them to use other
mail programs.
Time Control
Whilst investigating the
strange behaviour of
the clocks in the
physics building, Kevin
has made an interest-
ing discovery. All clocks
of any significance
within IC, including
those behind the bars
in the union, are controlled centrally from
Sherfield. I fear this is only part of an
escalating attempt for complete control.
It was only recently reported in IC Distorter
that control of heating systems will be
handed over and controlled by a central
computer. Let's hope they get it right,
and we no longer find world class Linux
obsessed materials scientists asking:
"When is the IC heating going to be
adjusted to the current mild conditions so
I don't have to don beach wear to be
comfortable in my office?" Evidence of
control at a more supreme level can be
seen on Level Five, the location of the Rec-
tor's suite, where there is a switch which
appears to select between the seasons
summer and winter.
Fish Tank Foible
We, as students, are quite rightly very crit-
ical of some of the college's outrageous
spending on items such as the infamous
imported granite, and six figure sums
spent on flower beds. I am waiting to see
what reaction there will be to the pro-
posed spending of three to five hundred
pounds by ICU on a Fish tank! Kevin would
quite happily direct them to some very life-
like, and relaxing screen savers, which
can do a reasonable job of simulating fish,
which are a lot cheaper and a lot less has-
sle, and if intelligently used could give an
equally "fantastic" result, and without the
high maintenance costs of live fish.

P r e s i d e n t i a l Talk-Back
f Felix are short of news or want to
wind up some people, a headline
about sports
fields isn't too far
away. Although the
Capital Investment
Plan does allocate Â£3
million to the sports
centre from a ratio-
nalisation of College
sports fields, to draw
any conclusions as to
what may happen is
purely reactionary.
The attitude of a lot
of students I have
spoken suggests that
they think whoever
shouts the loudest,
'don't sell our
ground, sell theirs, because we play here'
will retain their preferred sports ground.
Thankfully I believe the issue will come
down to what is best for student sport
and not politics, for this Frank Murray's
view of a new ground closer to College
would be ideal.
Elections are upon us. There is an
Annual General Meeting in the Union on
the 28th of May in which every Officer
of the Union has to report what they
have done during the year. Anyone can
then question the officers on their
reports. Also at the Annual General
Meeting will be the elections of most of
the Officers for next year. If you want to
be more involved in the Union or want
to be any of the positions listed below,
David Hellard, ICU President
all you have to do is sign up on the
board outside of the Union Dinning Hall
with ten seconders
and turn up with as
many people as you
can to vote for you
(every full time stu-
dent has a vote.)
