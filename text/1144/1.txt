Room Shortage for Future Students
The College will face a serious shortfall
In available bed spaces for freshers
within the next three years, which
threatens to throw the all-important
guarantee of a hall room for every first
year into doubt.
The problem arises due to the fact 2000
that the number of bed spaces
required will rise over the next few
years from the present figure of 1686 -| qqq
to over 2000 (due to ever-increasing
intake and the Wye merger) whilst the
number of rooms available will fall. 1600
The cause of the problem is the urgent
need to renovate practically every hall
the College owns within the next five 1400 |
years, on Health & Safety grounds,
which in turn will bring about the sale
of Montpelier, Garden, Brabazon and 1200
Olave halls by the summer of 2002.
Moreover, whilst the current Resi-
dences Plan promises that "the Col-
lege will continue with its...policy of
guaranteeing accommodation for first
years", it does not suggest any way in
which the current problem can be
solved, instead investing in the hope
that the number of students taking up
hall offers will fall from the present

88% as a result of the introduction of
fees.
The programme will begin with
the £13 million Beit refurbishment next
year. However, as soon as these addi-
tional beds come on line, the two year
phased renovation of Southside (cost:
£14.5 million) and the Weeks project
(cost: £1.1 million) begin, and then in
the summer of 2001 the five year Fve-
lyn Gardens rolling refurbishment com-
mences (cost: 12.5 million), which will
take one hall out of action each year.
Due to the College's policy that all
non-academic areas (sports, resi-
dences, catering etc) must break-even,
this in turn requires that the College
"realise other assets from the Resi-
dences portfolio". In other words, the
bed spaces in Garden and Brabazon
Halls will be sold off in summer 2001,
and Montpelier and Olave Houses will
disappear the following July.
Even greater problems will arise
in the availability of rooms for what the
College describes as "priority students"
- ie Erasmus students, first year over-
seas postgrads, re-apps, sabbaticals
etc. The sale of the halls already men-
tioned, coupled with a slight increase
in student numbers means that within
five years the College will be faced
with a short-fall of at least 200 beds
(even when the guarantee of a room
for all final year medical students is
withdrawn).

Information provided by the College's
Private Housing Office has raised
doubts over last weeks story entitled
"Accommodation's Adverse Advice".
The story alleged that a member of
the office's staff had recommended a
40% increase in rent, from £65 a week
to £90 a week, to the owner of a prop-
erty in West Brompton. However, the
Private Housing Officer, Catherine
John, has stated that "at no time did I
mention £90 a week" as an accept-
able rent for the rooms in question.
She went on to say that she suggested
to the landlady that "I can't see you
being able to achieve anything more
than £80 a week for your larger rooms,
but for the smaller rooms I would sug-
gest £70-75". The current rental price
was confirmed by a copy of a letter
from the landlady to the Housing
By David Roberts
Office, confirming final valuations of
£75 a week for the smaller rooms and
£80 a week for the medium rooms.
She also denied that she had had a
conversation with any of the students
in question, and demonstrated that
the property in question has never
been listed at £90 a week
Mrs John explained how she.
approaches the issue of offering
advice on prices, "my remit has always
been to look after the Imperial stu-
dents and find them affordable accom-
modation...if someone asks me for a
professional opinion I will give my
opinion - it's not my advice, it's my
opinion of what can be achieved". She
also explained that she is increasingly
looking to vet properties before they
are put onto College lists, which will
bring to an end one of the most fre-
quently cited problems with the.
service.
The students concerned in the alle-
gations were unavailable for comment
this week, due to examinations. How-
ever, a further update will appear later
this term, which will hopefully pro-
duce a consensus of opinion from the
two sides involved.
Until then Felix would like to apol-
ogise to any individuals who felt they
were misrepresented. The photo fea-
tured was of the a c c o m m o d a t i o n
office, not the private housing office,
which is of course situated in the base-
ment of the building.
