East Meets West Apology Caldwell Replies.
Dear Sir,
It has recently been brought to my
attention that a complaint was made
by the Sikh Society with regards to a
comment made during one of the
comedy sketches in East meets West
1998.
The comment made was referring
to a white man wearing a turban, 'take
that turban off, you look like shit...
Bloody Care in the Community!!' As he
was addressed, the white man was
standing next to an Asian man pointed
out as being Sikh. The point of the joke
was that the white man was a lunatic
and did not understand what he was
doing. In no way whatsoever was any
offence intended to any members of
the Sikh religion. In retrospect, we see
that offence may have been caused to
people who may not have compre-
hended the origin of the joke. We
would also like to point out at this
stage that Sikhs were consulted with
regards to this matter, and they found
no problems with the original line.
Obviously these views were not rep-
resentative of the Sikh Society, and
we accept this.
Please accept our unreserved
apologies for any offence we may
have caused.
Yours sincerely,
The Writers of Comedy

Dear Editor,
With response to N Royall's letter, I'm
afraid I have no link with Caldwell Invest-
ments (which sounds like good news if
the information is correct).
Can I suggest however you watch
"The Caldwell Partners", a Canadian Firm
of Executive Search Consultants whose
motto is "Never Underestimate the
importance of people"
In response to last week's Voice of Reason
Dear Simon,
You and I are in danger of agree-
ing)!)...With regard to your comments
on fire signage, I personally also have
concerns about the level of signage the
College has to adopt. I too think that a
call point is self evident and does not
need to be signed. Indeed the way
things are going in a few years we will
have signs pointing to other signs. We
do, however, have an legal obligation to
follow national - and indeed European
guidelines - in these matters. The
assumption is that a visitor/stranger to a
department, who may not be familiar
with the layout of the building, may have
to react quickly.
