Kingpin (PC)
Interplay
Every once in a while a game attracts the
attention of the press for its originality,
excellence and beauty. Then there are
games that grab press attention because
of their violent themes. These games
burn bright with publicity, though once
the public get to play the game properly
most are defrocked as superficial and
too cartoon like to be truly graphic (Such
as the Quake body explosions) or, even
worse, hyped up poor games.
Interplay's Kingpin looks ready to be
the next target in the Mail and Express
anti-game crusade (or my name is not
Captain Moral Guardian), and yet, hap-
pens to be slightly deeper than the aver-
age British Board of Censor's sense of
humour.
Set in a downtown American ghetto
it is your Job to fight through a mass of
beefed up pimps, prostitutes and other
human dregs in an attempt to get a
chance at revenge against a society that
marginalises cultural minorities - or just kill
and maim.
Using a tuned Quake
2 engine, the graphics
flow as impressively as
they are detailed. The
graphics and the game
also respond to action.
Smack the body and the
body receives the dam-
age. Go for the kneecap
with the iron bar and the
opponent falls clutching
a very sore body part - giv-
ing enough time for the
fatal blow to the back of
the neck. Yup the game is
violent, to the extreme.
Then there is the language, and for
once it's not a complaint about the Amer-
icanisms. Simply put this is not a game to
play at your parents' and
definitely not one to
show off the ability of
the sound system when
great aunty Ethel visits.
Controversial bits
aside, the impressive
graphics do not hide an
excellent game. Guns,
despite the aims of the NRA, are not
found on the floor every step of the way
and tend to be guarded, though the
pawn shops seem to be able to stock
pretty much anything the average hood
would need in a one man war.
The elements of realism that have
been fitted into the
game can be seen within
the first few minutes.
Walking with a hidden
gun is better than run-
ning about with a gun
waving in the air. The
locals arc not all out to
get you but do tend to
be a little paranoid when
they see a mad gun
wielding crazy man run-
ning at them.
Locals also show
other behaviours such as being distracted
by Cypress Hill soundtracks that scream
from ghettoblasters, and begging for
their life as you beat them. Yes it is very
violent. Interplay are about to ride the
express elevator to notoriety - it's a very
naughty place.

Tired, Listless, games editor seeks successors to the crown
Unfortunately it is almost time to leave the office and attempt to brave the light outside which you normal people call sunlight. But before they allow me to do this I
need to hand over the crown of shiny things to a worthy successor.
If you think you can play games and write about them, if you can handle receiving games for free and not boast too loudly, you could be next year's games editor.
Pop into the office and attend next M o n d a y ' s meeting at 12:30 (17th May), or mail me if you can't make it. Remember it could be youuuuu.
