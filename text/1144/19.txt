Rowing
BUSA Victory Proves IC Superior Once Again
The BUSA regatta is a o n e day event
held at Holme Pierrepont in Notting-
ham. It's often an unpredictable event
because it is the first time in the season
that university crews meet on a Regatta
(ie short) course. Moreover, conditions
are usually windy, a n d sometimes
unfair. However, as May 1 st blossomed
into an uncharacteristically sunny May
bank holiday weekend, crews were
warming up for the long battle ahead.
The first round in the W o m e n s
eight category was a hair raising affair.
The regatta was running about half an
hour late, so we decided to arrive at the
start in time for this. Unfortunately, due
to safety problems with our boat we
arrived at the start to see our heat rac-
ing off down the course. Swift deliber-
ations with officials secured us a slot in
the second heat, because o n e crew
had failed to show. As we slipped onto
the start, with a warning for tardiness,
we attempted to collect ourselves for
the ensuing race.
A rather sluggish start left us down
on the rest of the field at 500m gone,
but we clawed our way back to level
pegging by 250m to go. By now, two
crews, Bristol and ourselves, had broken
away from the rest of the pack. A sprint
finish produced what looked, to the
casual observer, like a dead heat. We
waited with fear and trepidation to hear
the final verdict - it came in our favour,
and w e continued to the final as Bris-
tol spat teeth a n d g u n n e d . f o r our
blood. As the day progressed, condi-
tions changed into a raging tailwind,
and crucial decisions about boat rig-
ging were made. We hardened our
gearing and hoped the conditions
stayed the same.
The fours final provided useful
information on the changing condi-
tions, and the four finished in silver
medal position - a promising result for
the all important eight. The final
loomed and we boated in sufficient
time for the race. Again we were down
at the start but clawed our way back,
finishing two seconds ahead of the rest
(about two-thirds of a boat length).
The exalted crew returned home as
BUSA champions, ready to face the
coming season, culminating with Wom-
ens Henley in June.
