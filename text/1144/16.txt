Shadowman (PC, PSX & N64)
Acclaim
Evil does exist. Here we are not just talk-
ing about the run of the mill nastyness
of a flatmate using the last sheet of the
final toilet roll in the house at 2am in the
morning, or the typical boyfriend/girl-
friend torture that occurs at the end of a
bad relationship. This type of evil is the
bombing, serial killing and maiming evil
that should there be an afterlife, most
would rather not be on that side of the
eternal rest cruise ship.
Acclaim,
those very nice
people who
prvided us
with South
Park, are about
to invite you to
stop evil in its
plans for
armegeddon
(and they
don't mean
preventing a
remake of an
apalling sci-fi film, though there again...).
Taking the role of the shadow man
in this third person action-adventure you
cross the line between the living and the
dead to infiltrate the assylum - the final
resting place of killers, self-abusers and
those who forget Mothers' Day regu-
larly. Obviously this is a job for no ordi-
nary man. A man protected by the power
of the shadowmask- a weird voodoo arti-
fact - however, might just make it there
and back with-
out needing a
bodybag.
With graph-
ics trying to
recreate the
graphic novel
style seen in the
original valient
expect some impressive moody back-
drops to go with the incredibly detailed
character graphics. Acclaim have also
created a very
smooth animation
engine on both the
PC, Nintendo and
the Playstation ver-
sions. Although the
PC version was the
most detailed, all
three systems
showed Lara exactly
where to put her
bum ready for a
good kicking.
With Shadowman Acclaim look ready
to reserect their reputation for original
Action games.

Infrogrames
Tired of Tetris? Had enough of falling
colour blocks in your dreams? Luckily
Infogrames are about to come to the res-
cue with four new games in the shops.
Shanghai Pocket
Along with Tetris, majong must
surely be one of the most played games
out there. Start with a large pile of tiles
and whittle them away by matching pairs.
Devilishly easy to start, impossibly difficult
to stop. Either play against the clock or
try a bit of social interaction and play
against another person. There is also
another varient where the object of the
game is not to clear the pile but to find
the golden tile. Good clean fun.
Klustar
Oh no another puzzle game! This
time the blocks want revenge, and come
from all angles - well, sides really. Time
to fit them together in nice regular ways
and stop the mass growing too large
and touching the sides.
With sixteen difficulty levels ranging
from medieval land management stu-
dent to Impossibly, fiendishly difficult
with quite nasty and taxing somewhere
in between it's not going to be a quick
and sim-
ple game
to com-
plete.
There is
even a
neat two
player link
game just
to give a
outlet for
all that
competi-
tive
energy.

Looney Tunes
Whay hey a platform game for the
colour gameboy! It's not a puzzle game.
Really it's not. Each level features a dif-
ferent looney tunes hero, Daffy Duck,
Porky Pig even smart old Bugs Bunny bat-
tling against their arch enemies, Elmer
Fudd included.
If it's any-
thing like the old
black and white
gameboy ver-
sion it'll provide
ample relief
from these puz-
zle games and
put the fun and
humour back
into what was
becoming a bit
of a serious nerd
toy. We like fun
games!

V-Rally
Ok it's been out in black and white
form for ages and must have been the
cause of premature death of thousands
of AA and AAA batteries throughout the
world. This time it's back in colour - 56 of
them to be precise, and with four dif-
ferent cars, forty tracks in ten countries
those little cylinders of joy are about to
experience destruction on a scene not
seen since the great Tetris rush of '94.
For those not in the know don't
expect the latest in rendering or polygon
action. Instead re-live the exilement of
the Pole Positions. Monaco CP and other
racing games of that era. Now imagine
being able to really annoy all those lap-
top laiden, mobile phone addled
businessmen on long train journeys sim-
ply because you can. Good eh? Unfor-
tunately the screen shots here just dont
do it justice, they are colour on my screen
honest.
