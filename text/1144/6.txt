he other day I paid just shy of
£3.50 for a four-day-old copy of
The Daily Telegraph. As anyone
who knows me will tell you, under nor-
mal circumstances I would only buy
the aforementioned reactionary rag at
gun-point. But these were definitely
not normal circumstances. Had I taken
leave of my senses? Possibly. Was I in
the grip of a ruthless conman? Maybe.
Am I back in Japan again? Got it in
one, or more accurately in three. Wel-
come to the Land of the Rising Yen. Or,
in the case of this columnist, welcome
back.
When I was y o u n g e n o u g h to
come eye-to-knee with the proverbial
grasshopper, the closest the average
gaijin (foreigner) got to Japan was sit-
ting on the pillion of the H o n d a FZ50
owned by the brother of the boy next
door. Back in those days, all most of us
knew about the Japanese was that they
regularly ate fish containing lethal tox-
ins, got off on watching dangerously
overweight men wrestling in the semi-
nude, and that every so often their
capital city got flattened by a radioac-
tive dinosaur. Thankfully, largely due to
the proliferation of affordable sushi
restaurants, the growing popularity of
Manga, and the greater availability of
Japanese beer, we now live in more
enlightened times. However, there is
still a lot to learn about this place that
cannot simply be gleaned from hang-
ing around Waga-
mama, watching
Akira and drinking
a couple of cans of
Sapporo Super Dry.
My latest bout
of re-education
began in the
Kinokuniya Book-
shop under Umeda
station in down-
town Osaka. I had arranged to meet an
old friend from my Tohoku University
days, for raw fish and a few bottles of
Kirin Lager Beer (as advertised on TV by
Harrison Ford, incidentally) in the locale.
Arriving half-an-hour early, I'd decided
to kill a bit of time browsing in the
aforementioned aircraft hanger-sized
bookstore. Living in a foreign country
can be a daunting business at the best
of times and one of the things that
helps the disorientated ex-pat through
the first few tender weeks is being able
to get one's favourite paper from
home. Although I found mine, I could-
n't lift my heart high enough to fork out
the Y 850 (£4.50) necessary for its pur-
chase. Every leftie has his price and
mine appears to be Y 150, the differ-
"...as they were the
ones in possession of
the large, razor-sharp
knives, I wasn't about to
ardue the toss..."
ence between the cost
of a four-day-old copy of
The Guardian and a sim-
ilarly superannuated Issue of The Tele-
graph, which was a snip at Y 700.
In my (fairly wide) experience of
overseas living, being an ex-pat is by
turns a truly wonderful and truly dread-
ful business. The benefits of living in a
country rather than simply passing
through are obvious - however hard
they try, Messrs. Thomas Cook and
Funn Poly can't hope to
show you everything.
On the other hand,
travelling around on a
tourist visa at least car-
ries the advantage of
the possibility of going
home if it all starts to
get a bit much - not an
option open to those who have been
foolhardy enough to sign up for an
extended Tour of Duty.
The somewhat nebulous concept
of 'cultural differences' is frequently
banded about at this juncture in an
effort to explain why living in a foreign
country (any one will do, take your
pick) can sometimes be more stressed
than blessed. But in the event it is
often not so much this that makes the
ex-pat feel all at sea. In my case, to
paraphrase the recent BT commercial
"for me it is the little things" that peri-
odically make me feel like I've arrived
from another
dimension through
Matt Salter
"...every leftie
has his price, and
a wormhole In the
space-time contin-
uum, rather than
off an All Nippon
Airways 747 from
Heathrow. Things
like having to
stump up £4.50 for
a copy of The Grua-
niad, things like suddenly finding that
needing size 11 shoes qualifies you as
a medical freak, things like having to
pay the equivalent of approximately
£380 simply for the privilege of having
a telephone number. However it's not
all gloom. Living in Japan does have
many plus points, for example: 1) food
so fresh that it frequently arrives at
your table still in its death throes, 2) a
very low crime rate, 3) beer in vending
machines.
Eventually my friend showed up
and after a bit of mutual back-slapping
and many a "hisashiburi desu ne" (long
time no see), he took me off around
central Osaka and showed me the loca-
tion of such essential facilities as Tower
Records and Burger King, before head-
ing off for a late lunch at
a roadside noodle bar
that had apparently
appeared in the gutter overnight. It
really was great to see him again, and
while I undexterously chased some
ramen round in a bowl and out onto
the floor we caught up on old times.
This activity is a pretty similar procedure
in Japanese as it is In English, as peo-
ple graduate and get jobs, get married,
father children out of wedlock, and
have minor brushes
with the law in Japan
just as much as they
do in Britain, except for
the fact that they do it
mine W O U l d appear allln Japanese (double
back somersault with
t O be 150 Yen..." two-and-a-half twists -
degree of difficulty 3.5).
No matter what city one is in, there
is only so long that one can walk
around without getting hungry again
and after several hard hours of milling
about aimlessly, we were back on the
nosebag, this time in a Japanese-style
pub. Such establishments are called
izakaya, the Chinese characters for
which can be neatly translated as "a
room where there is alcohol". My kind
of joint. My friend had wanted to go for
noodles again but I insisted upon this
type of restaurant because they are
reasonably cheap, normally have a
good range of alcoholic beverages on
sale, but above all
they serve food
which is relatively
easy to pickup with
chopsticks. Even
better than that,
there arc lots of
things on skewers
which you can just
pop into your
mouth and remove
with your teeth. While this does mean
that you run the risk of perforating
your ulvula, at least you don't end up
scrabbling around trying to pick food
items out of your shirt pocket where it
fell after you jumped out of your skin
when one of the waiters, standing
directly behind you, suddenly bellowed
a greeting to a new customer who has
just entered the shop. The staff shout
a lot at izakayas. They scream a wel-
come at you when you come through
the door, bawl cheerfully when you
are changing out of your shoes into
ludicrously small slippers and they call
out the name of every single dish when
they bring it to your table. Quite why
they feel the need to inform every-
body in the room whenever you order
"...at £4.20 a pop,
this place made "crazy
London prices" look
like the height of
reasonableness
another beer or a plate of yakitori (a
sort of Japanese chicken satay) escapes
me, but as they were the ones in pos-
session of the large, razor-sharp knives,
I wasn't about to argue the toss.
Several hours and many large cups
of the local sake later, we stumbled out
of the restaurant with the staff bawling
out their thanks and entreaties to come
again in our wake, and wove our way
down the street to another bar, improb-
ably called the Pig and Whistle which
my friend proudly informed me was a
"traditional British pub". And by golly he
was right - you might as well have been
in the Ennismore Arms, a point which
I am not ashamed to admit brought a
tear to my eye. The moistness round
rims became even more pronounced
when I saw that they were serving real
draught Guinness and then turned into
a veritable flood when I realised how
much a pint was going to cost me. At
Y 800 (£4.20) a pop, this place made
"crazy Fondon prices" look like the
height of reasonableness. I must admit
that they'd gone out of their way to
capture the authentic atmosphere of a
British ale house though, right down to
the sticky puddles of beer on the bar
and soggy fag ends in the urinals. As I
sank the first of many pints of Pure
Genius I began to take in my sur-
roundings and for the first time in
weeks I began to feel at ease. In fact,
so relaxed was I, that when I was chal-
lenged to a game
of darts, I made lit-
tle protest and,
although at this
point I was on the
point of losing the
ability to focus, I
felt the spirit of
John Bull well up
within me (or
maybe it was heart-
burn brought on by too much raw
squid) and I strode purposefully up to
the oche.
I think it is safe to say that by the
time I left the Pig and Whistle, the
Japanese had a radically different view
of the current state of British darts.
And, regretfully, leave I did. It was time
to go. As my friend and I staggered out
of this delightful establishment, I gave
the barmaid, who was now looking
much better than she did when I had
come in, a Paddington Bear-style hard
stare and warned her that if she didn't
get some Sarah Hughes Dark Ruby by
the next time, there just might not be
a next time. However, I don't think she
believed me, and in my heart of hearts,
neithet did I.
