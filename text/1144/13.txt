ULTRASOUND
Everything; Picture [
One these people Is pregnant, who
needs the ultrasound?
Y
ou'll either love it or hate it. It's
rock with a twist a n d it won't be
to everyones liking. It's music for
the indie kids w h o are angry with every-
o n e a n d everything. Play it loud a n d it'll
b l o w y o u away. Play it soft a n d it'll just
depress y o u .
Everything Picture is Ultrasound's
debut a l b u m that comprises o f two C D ' s
yet only 11 tracks. T h e reason for the
d o u b l e CD? I don't k n o w but it's kind o f
fun a n d I like it. T h e fact that t h e s o n g s
o n this 88-minute m a s t e r p i e c e are
s e g u e d together with "incidental music"
is a tad irritating at times but y o u s o o n
get used to it. If you don't k n o w the band
t h e n the w o r d s "bloater" a n d "porker"
might j o g your m e m o r y into r e m e m -
bering w h o they are as they describe
front m a n A n d r e w W o o d t o a T. If I say
the w o r d s 'Independent' a n d 'The', your
m e m o r y might b e j o g g e d e v e n further
as t h e b a n d w e r e recently featured as
front p a g e n e w s for d o i n g s o m e t h i n g
w h i c h , in m y o p i n i o n , is so obviously a
publicity stunt it's untrue. "Tiny", as W o o d
is affectionately referred to by the rest o f
the world, c a u s e d controversy at a Red
or Dead fashion s h o w w h e n he lifted the
dress (??) he w a s w e a r i n g to reveal t h e
w o r d ' u n i q u e ' scrawled across his s t o m -
ach as t w o o f his fellow b a n d m e m b e r s
streaked across t h e catwalk. It's things
like this that m a k e m e think Ultrasound
are just a bit too desperate to make it big.
This c o m e s across very strongly in their
lyrics and quotes, w h i c h are meant to be
p r o f o u n d , but arc actually quite stupid.
H a n g o n t h o u g h , maybe I'm missing the
point a n d a m taking t h e m too seriously.
They're f u n a n d are in love with t h e m -
selves- there's n o t h i n g w r o n g with thai.
Their first single w a s a Gregorian terrace
anthem...need I say more?
f o u r o f t h e s o n g s o n t h e a l b u m
have b e e n singles with Floodlit World
being the most successful in reaching
the t o p 30. Stay Young is brilliant with
W o o d s ' p o w e r f u l , if ever s o slightly
a n n o y i n g voice, m a k i n g adrenaline lev-
els rise a n d hairs stand o n e n d . C o m -
bining both c o m p l e x a n d d u m b lyrics
this s o n g illustrates to m e what the b a n d
are all about. The s o n g is full o f weird ref-
erences to Gary Glitter as well as the nor-
mal t e e n a g e angst stuff. It's a s o n g for
u n d e r a ge drinkers a n d b e h i n d t h e bike-
shed smokers w h o hate living with their
parents.
Impossible Dream is perfect a n d I
love it. It has everything y o u could ever
w a n t In a s o n g a n d more. It's a mixture
of m e l l o w w o r d s , l o u d c h o r u s e s a n d
strange samples that'll m a ke you want to
j u m p a r o u n d a lot- m a k i n g sure the cur-
tains are closed first so n o o n e can see
you.
for a b a n d w h o say they only ever
w a n t e d to "turn the world o n " , they're
g o i n g the right w a y about it. It's b e e n
said that they have 'reached the kind o f
soul fanfare peak o f salvation rock that
most bands s p e n d a lifetime building up
to'. W h e t h e r this Is true or not I can't
decide but as I said earlier, you'll either
love it or hate it. I don't hate it so I guess
that m e a n s I love it.CI

NAUGHTY BY NATURE
Nature's Finest
Naughty by name.
Naughty By Nature.
N
e w material is o n the w a y but
your profile isn't what it used
to be, so what are y o u g o i n g to
do? Is it (a) release a greatest hits c o m -
pilation, (b) release a greatest hits c o m -
pilation or (c) get caught in a public toi-
let putting your tackle out o n offer? The
usual course o f action is the first t w o
options, t h e third less favoured but just
as useful s o it s e e m s .
N a u g h t y by Nature arrived, via the
far f r o m cool zoot-suited N e w Style, in
t h e late '80s/early '90s at a time w h e n
Hip-Hop had reached its zenith: amongst
others, Public Enemy w e r e c o m b i n i n g
fierce political/social c o m m e n t with t h e
B o m b Squad's sonic experimentation,
De La Soul h a d plug-tuned us into the
Daisy A g e with wit-laden-sample-fests,
Rakim w a s p r o d u c i n g raps o f p o e t i c
beauty over Eric B's breakbeats a n d t h e
Flavor Unit w e r e in full effect. There w a s
the versatile soulful raps o f Q u e e n Lati-
fah, t h e d e x t e r o u s riff in' o f Lakim
Shabazz a n d then there w a s Naughty By
Nature. All o f t h e former w e r e credible
but w e r e the latter? Well yes and no, their
style b e i n g polymorphic, marrying lyrics
of serious insight a n d ear-hemorrhaging
basslines with m e l o d i c c h o r u s e s a n d
slick R&B dynamics, conjures up a mixed
bag. Taking a B o b Marley riff a n d c o u -
pling it with penitent lyrics about a lost
c h i l d h o o d p r o d u c e d the massive Every-
thing's Going To Be Alright. Hip Hip
Hooray exemplifies Nature's knack o f
p r o d u c i n g c o m p e l l i n g chant-along
anthems. However, s o m e t h i n g strange
h a p p e n e d to soul/R&B music in the late
'80s. Inventive, impressible t u n e s w e r e
replaced by torpid m u s h ; the g r o u n d
breaking, spine tingling s o n g s o f t h e
M o t o w n , Atlantic a n d Stax record labels
in t h e '60s/'70s w e r e s u c c e e d e d by t h e
inane tuneless pulp o f R Kelly a n d his
like. Vintage soul classics w e r e Aryanised
a n d m u r d e r e d by Celine, M a r i a h etc.
The p h e n o m e n o n even dragged its fetid
corpse into Hip-Hop, Nature's Penetra-
tion b e i n g a particularly u n p a l a t a b l e
e x a m p l e o f m e a n d e r i n g lushness.
Still, at their most f o c u s e d the boys
have the talent to c o m e up trumps, the
irresistible OPP b e i n g a case in point.
'You d o w n with OPP?' c hant the group,
'Yeah, y o u k n o w m c l ' I retort as I j u m p
with wild a b a n d o n o n m y b e d , e v e n
t h o u g h I haven't got a b l o o d y clue w h a t
OPP stands for. However, all things must
pass a n d my M a b a n g i n g o n m y b e d -
r o o m d o o r t h r e a t e n i n g to revoke my
afternoon treat o f J a m m y Dodgers a n d
Tizer s o o n puts pay to such frivolity. So,
an a l b u m that is certainly Nature's finest
but you're g o i n g to have to buy a Pub-
lic Enemy collection for Hip-Hop's finest.
