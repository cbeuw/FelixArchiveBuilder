A brief, mostly wrong history of the lo-fi aesthetic
I
n a world far before
the age of high-fidel-
ity recording, there
was the gramophone.
Recordings from the era
are near-inaudible; the
band plays as loudly as
possible, so as to make
the recording as clear
as can be. The sound is
marked by tinniness and
an unmistakable crackling
sound, as the needle sens-
ing the audio encoded on
cylinders of wax skated
over random bumps and
dips that weren’t supposed
to be there.
Fast forward forty
years. Barriers were
falling. A ‘lo-fi’ hit had
already charted; Johnny
Ace’s‘MySong’,recorded
in 15 minutes in a radio
station, hit #1 on the R&B
charts in 1953. And, as
people began to gravitate
towards new genres that
eschewed studio time, the
necessary compromises of
recording in less-than-ide-
al circumstances caused a
sea change in aesthetics
palatable to the common
audience.
Well, maybe not to all
the ears of the time. The
Beach Boys released a
trio of albums in 1967
and 1968 (Smiley Smile,
Wild Honey, and Friends),
recorded in Brian
Wilson’s makeshift home
studio. Now packaged
in the “Bedroom Tapes,”
the albums were the first
properly lo-fi (as far as
production is concerned)
in existence.
In the ensuing decade,
little headway was made.
Artists like Paul McCa-
rtney and J.W. Farquhar
recorded on portable
equipment, but such
projects saw little cultural
acclaim. The lo-fi aesthet-
ic belonged to the punks
at this point – nobody else
was too bothered about it.
But the lo-fi aesthetic
lived on. The rise of punk,
grunge, and shoegaze in
the 80s and 90s brought
a revival to the sound,
with renowned bands like
Operation Ivy, Slowdive,
and Nirvana all experi-
menting with low fidelity
production to some extent
or another. And oddly
enough, there was some
folk around, too.
The late 80s saw the
formation of Neutral
Milk Hotel, arguably the
most recognizable act in
the genre. If you haven’t
already, treat yourself to
1999’s In the Aeroplane
Over the Sea, a disori-
enting barrage – nay,
masterwork – of eclectic
instrumentation, abstract
lyricism, and a raw, dis-
torted passion. The album
has become a cultural
icon, a touchstone among
fellow music nerds when I
lived in the States. Largely
a continuation of their
earlier work (their 1996
debut On Avery Island:
fantastic btw). Neutral
Milk Hotel blended a
folk-punk sensibility with
something more profound,
and that magic glue is the
lo-fi aesthetic that allows
such abstract lyrics to feel
close, personal, confes-
sional.
Speaking of personal,
confessional lyricism,
there’s more folk to bring
up. Through the 80s, John
Darnielle was recovering
from a rough home life,
taking methamphetamine,
working as a psychiatric
nurse, and playing guitar.
In 1991, he went off to
college, studied English,
and started recording his
guitar playing into his
boombox. These tapes
became the first Mountain
Goats releases; since then
a fecund poet, Darnielle’s
distorted voice can be
found nurturing disgrun-
tled, literary-minded
twenty-somethings late
into the night, lyrics
peppered with pathos.
Emo came into its own
at about this time, and boy
did they pick up big on the
sound. Bands like Sunny
Day Real Estate and
Modest Mouse took the
subtle grit and ran with it.
Nay, emo became lo-fi, to
the point where even rela-
tively new acts like Elvis
Depressedly connect
to the genre essentially
through their down vibes
and lo-fi sound, breaking
nearly entirely in terms
of instrumentation and
licks. And while I’m still
(obliged to be) talking
about emo, I must mention
Brand New, whose later
albums dip into the
aesthetic quite readily. I
should also mention Jesse
Lacey allegedly jerked
it in front of teenagers
over Skype though, so
don’t give them your ad
revenue. Or, really, don’t
listen to emo, because
there’s nothing more
aggravatingly grating to
me than listening to music
with the emotional depth
of a wet rag. Hate mail
will be forwarded to my
recycling bin.
Then, the 2000s
dawned. Godspeed You!
Black Emperor made
selective use of lo-fi to
add texture over their
rock-kitted orchestra,
featuring field recordings
(and a chilling bagpipe
recording off F#A#). Indie
went down a lo-fi rabbit
hole, as did the rap game
(El-P and the Def Jux
guys).
And electronica. Chill-
wave and glo-fi emerged
in the late noughts, and
while it was hype for a
time, it soon died down.
Or did it? An offshoot of
the above revolves around
J-Dilla or Nujabes-style
beats, oft referred to
simply as “lo-fi hip hop,”
taking samples of jazz
songs and looping them
over a funk break. Cop a
jhfly album, it’s worth it.
Oh, and vaporwave, I
guess. But that’s a meme
anyways, so whatever.
Lo-fi techniques are
varied. Many artists will
blend the hiss of vinyl
back into their music for a
warm and nostalgic mood.
Others roll off the highs,
yielding a mellower,
muted sound. Some crank
gain and seethe white
noise. Punk bands go for
a DIY sound to match
the ethos of the music;
Godspeed uses it to build
a setting. Folk bands use
rough equipment to culti-
vate an air of honesty and
sincerity. When contextu-
alized, the lo-fi aesthetic
lends the artist a powerful
creative tool – and its
effect on the listener.
So, um, why? What is
it exactly that makes lo-fi
so appealing, from Mac
DeMarco to FIDLAR? In
my pretentious opinion,
lo-fibreaksthefourthwall.
Most music is recorded to
remove any imperfection
in the process of record-
ing, to capture the music
and nothing else. The spe-
cifics of the recording are
inconsequential. Contrast
this to lo-fi, which con-
fronts the listener with the
nitty-gritty of the album
being assembled in the
very fabric of the album;
the experience becomes
much more personal
and raw. This closeness,
often bolstered by room
acoustics, gives lo-fi its
intimacy.
Fuck it, let’s all go back
to the wax.
How can something that sounds so bad in principle sound so very good in practice? Felix investigates.
