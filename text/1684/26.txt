Just before the start of this academic year, a group of keen geologists visited Corsica to complete the toughest
trail in Europe, with financial support from the IC Exploration Board. One of the team members, Georgios
Chatzitheoklitos, shares their experience of getting the funding and preparing for the adventure.

How it all started…
B
eing an overly
excited prospec-
tive student,
I was reading
all the emails sent by the
college. There I stumbled
upon the Imperial College
Exploration Board and
learned about all the
student expeditions to
various exotic places that
the Board had previously
supported. Any Imperial
student can present a pro-
posal for an adventurous
expedition abroad and if
approved, the Board will
provide financial assis-
tance. The Board consists
of senior academics from
all departments who meet
twice a year, in December
and February, to consider
student proposals. The
proposals have to include
the budget, itinerary,
training schedule, and
risk assessment, and are
then judged based on their
viability and preparation.
Dream team search
In winter 2017, the
time was running out
as the deadline for the
proposal submissions
was approaching, and
many ideas were floating
around. But since
Georgios had recently
been to a Corsican restau-
rant and Max was reading
about the toughest trail
in Europe, the decision
on the destination came
about naturally: the
GR20, a 180km 15-day
transverse in Corsica, a
French island. It was the
perfect choice: safe, cheap
to travel to, and most im-
portantly would grant us
huge bragging rights!
Now we just had to find
people that were willing
and able to spend three
weeks of their summer
in the rugged mountains,
then plan everything,
and write a report! Even
though we were intro-
verted freshers and didn’t
know our coursemates
very well, it wasn’t hard to
assemble the team. Carla
was sitting next to the
boys in lectures and was
fascinated by the beautiful
pictures of the mountains
they were google-search-
ing. Georgios had heard
rumours that Diane was a
keen climber, while Carla
suspected that Harry
would be into it because
he wore really cool hiking
gear to lectures every
day. Max invited Jake
and Albert as well who,
after helping us with the
proposal, were informed
by their doctors that they
weren’t allowed to put
that much stress on their
knees.
But finally, the
combined efforts of seven
students who were very
close to the deadline
produced, as always,
spectacular results. We
were pleasantly surprised
to learn that the Board
wanted us to present our
proposal to them. The
surprise turned into stress
as we learned who the
Board was composed of:
lots of senior academ-
ics, with two of them
from our department,
and students who led
successful expeditions
in the past. After being
grilled for 20 minutes
(which felt like ages), all
we had to do was wait.

Kicking off the year with the toughest trail in Europe
We were slightly disap-
pointed as we didn’t think
we’d convinced them…
However, in spring 2017,
the long-awaited email
finally arrived, and it was
positive! They were going
to cover almost half of our
expenses, including insur-
ance and first aid training.
Without such a massive
amount of support, it
would’ve been impossible
to do the GR20.
Preparation
Even though we were
almost half a year away
from the trip start date,
there was a lot to prepare
– equipment, plane/ferry/
train/bus tickets (since all
of us were going to leave
from a different place),
andaccommodationonthe
island. Also, in summer
2017, to ensure our new
kit was up to scratch
and the group’s fitness
was good enough, Max
organised a weekend trip
to the Brecon Beacons, a
mountain range in Wales,
where he had planned a
50km route over two days.
Unfortunately, on the first
day, Max’s leather boots
caused him problems
to such extent that we
decided not to continue
the hike. Instead, we tested
out the tents, sleeping
bags, and sleeping mats in
Carla’s back garden: we
were then confident that
our kit was fit for the trail,
since it survived a night
in the rainy wilderness of
Swindon. The attempted
training weekend in Wales
was still a useful experi-
ence because Max bought
a new pair of fabric boots
which didn’t cause him a
single blister during the
entire length of the GR20.
Off to Corsica!
In September 2017,
starting from all around
Europe, we began our long
journey to Corsica. After
36 hours of travelling and
four means of transport,
we finally arrived. We
were all annoyed after
sleeping on the ferry but
little did we know that it
would be the most com-
fortable sleep for the next
15 days! We visited the
last affordable supermar-
ket we could find (where
we forgot to buy cooking
gas…) and went to our
AirBnB to prepare for the
big day. The first thing to
arouse our curiosity was
that Diane’s rucksack felt
like a sack of bricks. This
was closely seconded
by the mystery of how
Georgios’s bag with six
(yes, 6!) t-shirts, seven
pairs of underwear, and
a glass bottle of Cognac
did not feel like a sack
of bricks! And although
there was excitement and
anticipation in the air, we
were also anxious as we
didn’t know how the hell
we’d manage to walk the
toughest trail in Europe!
Further adventures
In the next article:
the team steers off the
trail to climb the highest
peak of the island and
gets followed by 80
Belgian paratroopers,
and the reason behind
Diane’s heavy rucksack is
revealed! So stay tuned.
