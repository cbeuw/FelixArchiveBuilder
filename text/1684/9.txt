aving to treat
cancer once
is enough, but
stubborn tu-
mours often have a habit
of coming back, with
cancer stem cells (CSC)
as the likely culprits.
These notorious cells
have the ability to self-re-
new and to give rise to all
cell types found in cancer
samples, contributing
to tumour heterogeneity
and relapses. Researchers
are therefore keen to un-
derstand how these cells
communicate in order to
develop novel tools to
defeat cancer.
A recent breakthrough
was reported by a group
in Germany, where they
found Hedgehog signal-
ling was required for the
survival of colon CSC.
Whilst the name
Hedgehog signalling may
remind you of cute house-
hold pets, in developmen-
tal biology it is known
to be a crucial cellular
communication method
that regulates cell growth,
development, and tissue
homeostasis. In fact, the
major signalling molecule
in this pathway, Hedgehog
(Hh), was named by the
scientists who discovered
that the larvae of fruit
flies that lack (Hh) had an
abnormal spiny appear-
ance. This highlights the
Hedgehog’s role in devel-
opment across species, as
well as the lack of creativ-
ity among scientists!
Another important
signalling pathway is
called Wingless-related
integration (WNT). In
the intestine, WNT helps
to maintain the plasticity
or ‘potency’ of intestinal
stem cells, allowing these
cells to replace dead intes-
tinal cells with new ones.
Given the importance
of WNT and Hedgehog
signalling in both de-
velopment and stem cell
maintenance, it is not
surprising that mutations
in WNT signalling can be
found in 90% of colorec-
tal cancers. Unexpectedly,
Hedgehog genes are not
mutated in most cases,
but are often upregulated,
suggesting that both WNT
and Hedgehog signalling
play a major role in the
progression of colon
cancer.
Based on this hy-
pothesis, researchers in
Germany used cancer
organoid models, a 3D
culture of tumour cells
obtained from patients,
to study the relationship
between these pathways
and colon CSC.

his year,
Imperial College
Neuroscience
Society held its
fourth annual conference
– ‘Meeting of the Minds’
– hosting prestigious clini-
cians and neuroscientists
from across the UK. This
was indeed an apt title for
the event, as research find-
ings were shared, creating
stimulating discussions
and a buzzing atmosphere
of intellectual curiosity!
The conference
brought together speakers
from many world-class
institutions, including
Imperial, UCL, Oxford,
and Cambridge – to name
a few. Having commenced
a BSc in Neuroscience at
UCL in 2014, I have been
following this conference
since its inception. On
every occasion it explores
current themes, with many
students having the op-
portunity to watch a live
brain dissection by the
exceptionally experienced
Professor Steve Gentle-
man. This year’s themes
included neurodegener-
ation, neuroadaptation,
paediatric neurology, and
many more.
The day started with
a warm welcome at
registration from the com-
mittee of Imperial College
Neuroscience Society,
and a keynote speech
on primary progressive
aphasia from Professor
Peter Garrard. Later in the
day, Imperial’s own Dr
Amin Hajitou discussed
delivery of genes to the
CNS to help treatment
of neurodegenerative
diseases and cancers such
as glioblastoma. To date,
methods employing ret-
roviruses, adenoviruses,
adeno-associated viruses,
and herpes-simplex virus
have had significant
limitations. However, Dr
Hajitou described why
the use of bacteriophages
may be a more favourable
approach. Bacteriophages
are viruses which only
infect bacteria and are
found in water and food
offering us protection.
They can naturally cross
the blood-brain barrier,
and once they have
cleared their target they
are removed by microglia.
They work by targeting
a ligand, and can be
manipulated for selectiv-
ity to various molecules.
The talk finished with
a poignant quote: ‘the
enemy of my enemy is my
friend’.
The second part of
the day hosted a choice
of several speakers,
including Dr Patrick
Grover from the National
Hospital for Neurology
and Neurosurgery, and
Dr Bianca Jupp from
Cambridge University.
Dr Grover discussed his
research investigating
functional and structural
connectivity (tractogra-
phy) with implications
in neurodegenerative
disease. His work has
investigated the roles of
the brain’s default mode
network (introspective)
and the salience network
(outside world). Dr Jupp
spoke next about her
research on the impli-
cation of impulsivity in
addiction, elucidating
which neurobiological
factors may influence this.
Dr Jupp’s findings have
implicated D2 receptors,
neuronal spine density,
and myo-inositol as
factors, and have brought
us one step closer to un-
derstanding the neurobi-
ology beneath addiction.
These were a few of
the many talks on offer
throughout the day,
ending on a keynote
speech from Professor
Sven Bestmann from the
UCL Sobell Department
of Motor Neuroscience
and Movement Disorders.
Professor Bestmann
spoke about potential for
precision in non-invasive
brain stimulation, and the
lack of disease specific
models of stimulation.
This year’s inspiring
conference finished with
a relaxed networking
session. With so much
to offer, this is an annual
event that is not to be
missed. We eagerly await
to see which speakers will
be on the jam-packed pro-
gramme next year. Until
2019!

expressions of the differ-
ent colon CSC in the orga-
noids, they discovered that
the WNT and Hedgehog
signalling related genes
are often switched on.
Upon further investiga-
tion with mouse models,
they demonstrated that
non-canonical Hedgehog
signalling, a particular
type of Hedgehog, drives
the WNT signalling
pathway. By geneti-
cally knocking out the
gene (PTCH-1) that is
involved in non-canonical
Hedgehog signalling,
this group showed that
non-canonical PTCH-1
dependent Hedgehog
signalling is necessary for
colon CSC survival. More
importantly, Hedgehog
controls WNT signalling
to maintain the pluripo-
tency of CSC by inhibit-
ing differentiation.
This is exciting because
these pathways could
potentially be targets for
future development of
anticancer drugs. Further-
more, two independent
groups have already tried
to target these pathways
in Hedgehog-dependent
pancreatic and breast
cancers cells in 2005, with
some degree of success –
providing evidence for the
feasibility of this concept.
Though we are still far
from obtaining a cure,
there is still hope, and it
would also be interesting
to see if this applies to
other forms of cancer too!

ost people
are aware
of the
a m a z i n g
ability dogs have to
sniff out targeted items
or substances they
have been trained for.
Although more com-
monly known as ‘sniffer
dogs,’ the correct term
for such trained canines
is detection dogs. They
are frequently used at
airports and other in-
ternational gateways to
detect illegal narcotics,
but may also be used to
detect explosives and
other contraband that
we ourselves are unable
to detect. Recently,
however, there has
been a growing use of
such well-trained dogs
to detect endangered
species which have a low
detection probability. This
has worked well in the
case of certain amphibian
species and can easily
be replicated across the
board for other such taxa.
sity’s African Amphibian
Conservation Research
Group have been inves-
tigating the potential use
of detection dogs to find
fossorial frog species.
Fossorial species pose a
number of problems in
terms of conservation
particularly when consid-
ering their low detection
rates as they spend a
majority of time buried
underground, especially if
they live in a hostile envi-
ronment. Using detection
dogs was successfully
trialled recently to find
members of the giant
bullfrog – a species which
is locally threatened.After
their success they hope to
train detection dogs to
find additional species
and even to detect traces
of diseases, which so far
have been promising!
There are examples
closer to home that
highlight the versatility
of detection dogs, par-
ticularly for an infamous
amphibian species: the
great crested newt is
loathed by developers all
over the country due to its
legal protection and the
work required to make
sure they are moved out
of harm’s way when land
developments takes place.
Unfortunately, when pond
or terrestrial habitats con-
taining newts are levelled,
not all of the individuals
can be removed. That
is where detection dogs
come in! Recently, a
cocker spaniel was used
in Norwich to find newts
still lurking in potential
cracks and crevices before
the construction of an im-
portant bypass. This effort
proved quite successful
and there are hopes that
similar work will occur
to help clear the way
for the proposed HS2
route. Man’s best friend
has yet another practical
application, one that
will hopefully expand
to other species, soon
to aid in conservation
efforts globally!

“Detection

Despite not being visible
to the naked eye they are
still present, and specially
trained detection dogs
have been proving this!

get bigger
by the
generation, scientists are
striving to keep things
small in order to cut down
on the cost of research.
An example would be an
‘organ-on-chip’, where
aspects of an organ are
mimicked on a piece of
polymer that is the size of
your palm! The applica-
tion of this technology is
vast – from drug discovery
to studying developmen-
tal biology. Not only can
these models reduce the
cost of research, because
fewer cells and reagents
are needed, but they can
also decrease the number
of animals required in
research.
A recent example of
how organ-on-chips can
be used is demonstrated
by a multi-national group,
which engineered blood
vessels on silicon chips
to understand the progres-
sion of cancer.
Cancer, similarly to you
and I, requires oxygen and
nutrients to grow. They
secrete chemicals into the
local environment, which
induce new blood vessels
to grow towards them
through a process called
angiogenesis, thereby
bringing nutrition to their
doorstep. If we can un-
derstand the mechanism
by which they feed them-
selves, scientists may
be able to starve them to
death.
This concept is old, and
available cancer drugs on
the market try to achieve
just that, but their efficacy
is disappointingly low.
Furthermore, traditional
models used to study
blood vessel growth have
their limits, and hence
better models are needed
for developing new thera-
pies against cancer.
A microvessel-on-chip
has been devised for this
purpose, and scanning
technologies have shown
these vessels can faithful-
ly mimic the process of
blood vessels sprouting
inside the body. On top
of that, they demonstrated
a key pathway that is
known to regulate angio-
genesis, suggesting these
engineered vessels are of
great biological relevance
to studying cancer.
To investigate whether
this model can be used
for drug testing they
treated the vessels with
anti-cancer drugs that
inhibit angiogenesis,
Sorafenib and Sunitinib,
as a proof-of-concept.
Their result confirmed the
effectiveness of such a
model and implicated the
potential use of microves-
sel-on-chip for drugs
screening in the future.
Nevertheless, there
are drawbacks to this
technology. Firstly, due to
its simplicity the direction
of angiogenesis cannot be
studied. As mentioned,
cancer cells often release
molecules to direct new
blood vessels to grow
towards them. This
model can only mimic the
development of vessels,
but not the directional
migration of angiogenesis
sprouting. Therefore, it is
likely that this technology
will be used in pre-clini-
cal models but may not
fully eliminate the use of
animals in research.
Nonetheless, this
model is an improvement
from traditional 2D-cell
culture, and other diseases
– such as rheumatoid ar-
thritis and diabetic retin-
opathy – can potentially
be studied. Hopefully,
in conjunction with high
throughput technologies,
more effective drugs can
be developed to cure
cancer and these related
diseases in the coming
decade.
