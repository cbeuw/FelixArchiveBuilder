I am fed up with adverts from authoritarian
states
Lecturers are striking: where can we claim
our tuition fee refund?
With strike action confirmed, almost three weeks of tuition will be lost. Are we still to pay?

U

are becoming
b u s i n e s s e s ,
treating stu-
dents as customers. If so,
they need to offer refunds
when they can’t provide
the services they are ex-
pected to provide.
After discussions with
Universities UK (UUK)
over pensions ended
without an agreement,
members of the University
and College Union (UCU)
have announced a wave of
strike dates. Strikes are set
to take place over 14 days
at 61 universities in the
UK, including Imperial.
The strikes will occur in
escalating waves, with the
first week seeing strikes
from 22nd-23rd February
and the second week from
26th-28th February; there
will then be a week’s
break, before a four-day
strike from 5th-8th
March, and finishing with
a five-day walkout from
12th-16th March.
This will result in the
loss of almost three weeks
of tuition, estimated at
around £675 per under-
graduate student.
This puts us students
in a difficult position.
Either we stand beside
the striking academics,
who are only defending
themselves against an
unjustified attack on their
pensions and their live-
lihoods, losing hundreds
of pounds worth of our
education, or we cross
over and support UUK.
I can only foresee and
expect solidarity with the
lecturers.
This is a choice that
students should not have to
make, and it is a choice we
do not have to make. We
students are now treated as
consumers, so we should
be given the same rights
as consumers: we should
be given a refund for each
day of strike action.
Rail companies like
Northern Railway and
Southern Rail already
offer refunds to commuters
who decide not to travel
on strike days. Airlines
also offer compensation
to travellers whose flights
are cancelled or delayed
due to strike action. These
refunds benefit both the
consumers and the striking
workers: consumers get
their money back and
therefore strike-breaking
by consumer pressure is
lessened.
Refunds focus the
impact of a strike squarely
on service providers
and offer consumers the
freedom to stand with
striking workers. You
could argue that students
are not normal ‘consum-
ers’, but by examining the
current model of higher
education, especially the
government’s Teaching
Excellence Framework
plans that increase
competition between uni-
versities, you’d struggle
to see students in any
other way. Students are
already internalizing this
fact: according to a recent
survey by ComRes, about
half the students in the UK
now view themselves as
customers.
As scientists or science
students we often see our-
selves outside the realms
of political interaction. We
often think of ourselves
as remote and unaffected,
using science as a shield.
However, science is not a
shield. It is not a unit, it
is made of different parts
that proceed in radically
different ways, all shaped
by the outside political
world.
We need to embrace
this outside political
world, and open our
eyes to the forces that are
changing higher educa-
tion - because these forces
will not stop with the dis-
mantling of our lecturers’
pensions, they will gnaw
away at the very heart of
education and science.
They will turn universities
into factories that exploit
researchers and students
to “advance knowledge”,
no matter the human cost.
I say we should be more
concerned in the support
of people than the ad-
vancement of knowledge
for profit.
I ask you to support
the lecturers by writing
to registry asking for a
tuition fee refund that
covers the period of the
strike. If universities see
us as consumers, we need
to act as consumers. Hurt
them where it hurts, their
pockets.
This week, Grumpy Bastard has been getting ads from states and would really like it to stop

a day with a simple trick
that involves a spatula.
Instead, these bits of
drivel have been replaced
with advertisements from
brands that get me, like
the Turkish and Polish
governments.
It’s not that these gov-
ernments have authoritari-
an streaks so wide it’s as if
they’ve let a toddler with
cholera loose in their un-
derwear, and it’s not that
they have a fetish for re-
writing history that makes
Big Brother look like the
only thing he enjoys is
lights-out eyes-closed
missionary; as always, the
thing that makes me em-
pathise with these brands
is their product.
From the Turks, it’s
the invasion of Kurdish
occupied Afrin. This is
my jam. It’s the continued
oppression of one of the
largest and unfortunately
geographically incoherent
ethnic groups in the whole
of the Middle East that
have taken a kicking from
every single one of the
countries in which they
are resident. In Turkey
they’re arrested, in Iraq
they were gassed, and in
Syria they were massa-
cred. Luckily, whoever
organises the YouTube
adverts is happy to ignore
this and ram on something
that would only appeal to
rabid Ottoman fans.
The Polish are, of
course, doing wonderful
things at the moment.
I’m a big fan of taking
away freedom from the
judiciary, but what they
advertised on YouTube
was right up my alley:
they have taken the
action of denying that any
Poles were involved in
the wholesale slaughter
of Eastern European
Jewry. Finally, someone
is approaching this topic
with the sensitivity of an
artillery barrage on the
Somme, and completely
ignoring the complex
moral problem that occu-
pation and collaboration
posed, just like the rest
of occupied Europe! A
whole section of history
that is completely ignored,
all for the benefit of the
moral scruples of a new
blind generation.
Why am I getting these
adverts, YouTube? I am
quite frankly not interest-
ed in these petty tyrants
attempting to justify
themselves in the face of
widespread condemnation
from the West and indeed
anyone with a brain.
Please remove them and

W
hen I am
s h o p p i n g
I can feel
d i f f e r e n t
parts of my brain whir-
ring away. The parts
I use for systematic
problem solving take a
break and instead it is
a desperate rush to find
the most sticker-coat-
ed, cheapest and most
appealing supplies for
the week ahead. It is
impossible, it seems, to
truly understand what it
took to create the fruits
of modern agriculture
and technology lined up
alongside their identical
siblings. How were they
made? Where were they
made?
This is something
which goes undiscussed
when we talk about
shopping. We talk about
shopping very much on
a personal level – “I like
your new trainers”, or “I
found a bloody bargain”
– but we don’t discuss
the value of how things
are made or the implica-
tions on a societal level.
This article serves as a
personal confession and
a challenge to all of you
out there who also silently
turn over similar thoughts.
Let me set the scene.
Just like millions of other
people, here I am on
Tuesday evening foraging
along white-painted
shelves in an LED-dap-
pled cornucopia of abun-
dance. Items sitting above
paper labels yell out to
our primate brains their
low prices or multi-pack
offers – and only as an
after-thought, mention the
fact it may have travelled
half the globe to get
here. The question nags
me – what impact do I
have on the environment
and the people where
these products are made
– people and places with
whom my only interaction
may be my selection of
some exotic ‘superfood’
or yellow-stickered ready
meal that are the fruits
of their labours, and to
whose troubles I give little
thought? What gives me
the right to make choices
about which things are
made? What gives any of
us this ability, other than
the privilege of sitting at
the top of the planetary
food chain?
These questions are not
easy to answer and may
take a backseat when in
the midst of a shopping
frenzy. It is however pre-
cisely these irrational de-
cision-making processes
which collectively cause
many of the problems we
face as a species – from
inequality to environmen-
tal damage.
For instance, when
choosing stuff do we
bother to read the ingre-
dients on the back of the
packet? You might be
surprised, like me, to find
that your lunch has a more
fantastic origin than you
might expect. Consider
the simplest sandwich you
can get in Library café – a
BLT or cheddar plough-
man’s. That sandwich
contains palm oil which
reaches you now thanks to
enormously sophisticated
supply routes spanning
the globe. Moreover, you
may ask, why are there
packs of blueberries in
bloody January? And…
when are tomatoes for
that mozzarella panini in
season exactly?
I do not worry that
such and such ingredients
being in my bread means
companies are conspiring
to poison us, or that
foreign migrants are in-
fringing upon the plastic
thrones of blue-blooded
British blueberries in their
seasonal absence.
I do worry that it is
only in recent history that
highly energy-intensive
processes, such as inter-
national transportation
and manufacturing, have
become intrinsic to every
part of our lives since our
discovery of fossil fuels.
It is not a sound plan for
our future to increase the
energy intensity of the way
we sustain ourselves. Re-
newable energies simply
will not be able to support
exponential growth like
fossil fuels were able to in
the past century and a half.
Former-banker turned
environmentalist Nate
Hagens remarks that our
contemporary economy is
predominantly “a measure
of how fast we can burn
through fossil capital and
convert it into immediate
neurotransmitter respons-
es”.
My second concern
is that this level of con-
sumption is not something
enjoyed by everyone
partaking in our society’s
food web. Just last week,
Oxfam published a report
estimating that 82% of
the wealth generated
worldwide last year went
to the wealthiest 1%.
The poorest 50% saw no
increase. Is it possible our
global food chain actually
depends on exploitation?
This being said, I
believe with our bonanza
of energy unlocked by
our discovery of coal and
oil, and our intelligence,
we have achieved a great
deal, such as providing
people with more time,
a higher level of societal
organisation and truly
remarkable scientific and
cultural achievements.
So what can we do to
remarkably successful
tool for fulfilling them.
Secondly, we need to
learn habits to help us
make the best decisions
we can in the shop, just as
we have learnt to switch
lights off when we leave
a room. For instance,
reducing meat consump-
tion is a simple way of
hugely reducing envi-
ronmental impact. The
New Scientist reports this
week that a medium-meat
diet of 50g-100g per day
produces 2600 kg of CO2
in a year – the equivalent
emissions of four return
flights to Majorca. For
measure, a typical ham
sandwich bears about 40g
of pig.
Thirdly, at the same
time as our environmental
footprint has worsened,
we have been equipped
with the tools to make
more informed decisions
when it matters. Today,
many of us carry smart-
phones everywhere we
go. The smartphone
brought us Fruit Ninja,
but it could also let us
look up how much energy
it takes to fly real fruit
from the other side of the
globe and slash our real
environmental footprint.
But while I have often
overheard people in shops
say “turns out it’s cheaper
on Amazon”, I have never
overheard someone say
“apples aren’t in season
at the moment”, or “turns
out this brand has better
working conditions than
that one”.
As individuals we
should use our choices
and technology to make
better, more democratic,
mindful decisions about
what we want and truly
need, rather than just
taking what is on offer.
“We have
many choices
in what we
purchase and
hence a power
to decide what
is created, by
whom, and by
what means”
save this? Firstly, we have
many choices in what
we purchase and hence a
power to decide what is
created, who it is created
by, and by what means.
Money is a token which
gives one a way, though
not the only way, to
express our values – what
we care about. Let me be
clear – spending more of it
is not going to make your
choice more ethical. Nor is
going for the things which
are perceived by others, or
by the claims on the label,
to be better. However, we
do have needs, and one
of our achievements as a
species is to develop this
