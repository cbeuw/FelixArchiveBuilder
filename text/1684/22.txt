I
s it possible to write
a novel about the
European Union?
Not just a book
about the history of the
European Union with
boring facts and figures
about its multiple conven-
tions and contracts, but a
proper novel with charac-
ters that could symbolise
the European Union. That
is the question that Robert
Menasse asked himself (in
2010) and without further
ado moved to Brussels in
2010 to find out about the
people who run the EU
and to be at the heart of
a machinery that defines
a whole continent. The
result of all this was the
novel The Capital, which
earned him the German
Book Prize in 2017. It
truly is a unique novel,
which circles around
Brussels, Europe, nation-
alism and politics.
Brussels is the heart
of the European Union
and it is also the heart of
the story. Actually, there
are five different, loosely
connected stories, which
run parallel to each other.
Each one has its own pro-
tagonists and sheds light
on everyday life in the
European capital from a
different perspective. The
central story follows bu-
reaucrat Martin Sussman
who works at the EU
commission’s head office
for culture. His ambitious
boss Fenia Xenopoulou,
a young Cypriot greek
woman,wantstoriseinthe
hierarchy of the European
Commission and is deter-
mined to demonstrate her
competence by organising
a celebration to honour the
60-year anniversary of the
European Commission.
However, very soon all the
people involved in project
have to realize that things
don’t come their way and
that there are some forces
within the EU working
against them, which they
cannot control.
Another story follows
David de Vriend, a Jewish
Auschwitz survivor,
who has just moved into
a retirement home. He
struggles with the past
and the present, especially
as the past slowly slips
away from his memory
and he appears to be a
lone survivor of a long
lost past. The other three
storylines introduce the
reader into the world
of a polish hitman of
the Catholic church, a
renegade police officer
trying to solve a murder
case off his own bat and
a Viennese professor of
economics, who comes to
the realisation his genera-
tion born in the fifties and
sixties is more revolution-
ary than today’s youth.
These stories are perfectly
chosen to provide a very
personal inside view of
how the EU and Brussels
work.
“Menasse is
not afraid
to point his
finger at all
the political
issues on
the Europen
continent ”
“Caution – Tories can
contain traces of pork!”
This is one of the many
political references
littered all across the
book. Menasse is not
afraid to point his finger at
all the political issues on
the European continent.
He manages to span an
arc over nations, cultures
and history, but at the
same time presents an
inside view of the EU and
its people with all their
strengths and weaknesses.
A special role is played by
Brussels itself, the place
where the bulk of the story
takes place. There are
hardly any descriptions of
places in the book, instead
streets, squares and tube
stations are just called by
their name, which makes
it hard for anybody who
has never travelled to
Brussels to form a mental
image of the scenery.
Nevertheless, the one
mental image of the city
that manifests itself is that
of a huge mess, a maze of
construction sites bathed
in noise, where incessant
demonstrations and an
overwhelming presence
of the police create
an atmosphere which
occasionally resembles
civil war scenarios.
Brussels is a modern day
Babylon, where people
from all over the conti-
nent, speaking dozens of
different languages try
to create something truly
great in the midst of an
enormous confusion.
Menasse illustrates this
by using characters from
a variety of backgrounds,
rich, poor, old and young.
He throws quotes and
passages in Polish, Greek,
French, Dutch, Czech
and many other European
languages.
One symbol stands out
above all and runs through
all the storylines: the pig.
The book starts with the
mysterious sighting of a
pig roaming the streets
of central Brussels. Like
a ghost the pig shows up
again and again. This pig,
which is so out of place
in a city like Brussels,
becomes a sensation,
especially as not even the
police are able to catch
it. Menasse also uses the
pork industry to tell a
story about the dealings
of agricultural lobbyists in
the EU.
Menasse draws
concrete conclusions
out of the current state
of the Union, albeit not
always positive ones. It is
paramount for the EU to
improve its public image
and to reconnect with
the European population.
He puts a human face on
the European Union and
attempts to build a bridge
between the personal
Europe, which we expe-
rience in our everyday
lives, and the impersonal
institution that is the
European Union. One of
the themes that define the
book is a recollection of
the original values of the
EU, written down in the
founding contracts of the
European Commission,
in particular the absolute
determination to prevent
atrocities akin to the ones
that tore Europe apart in
the first half of the 19th
century from happening
again. Menasse urges the
reader to think carefully
about the past, the present
and the future and to
not be blinded by short
sighted interests. The
future can be bright, if we
don’t forget the past.
