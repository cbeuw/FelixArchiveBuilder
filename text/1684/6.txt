Solving inequality at Imperial does not mean
relocating the campus to White City
Thomas Fisher responds to Alan Perfect’s article in an attempt to solve Imperials stark
inequality problem.

aving read
Alan Perfect’s
article on how
Imperial should
best tackle the obvious
equality problems it pos-
sesses, I felt compelled to
add my own opinions on
the matter to the melee.
As Alan pointed out
last week, Imperial now
has the highest ratio of
students from the most
advantaged backgrounds
to students from the
most disadvantaged
backgrounds. From
this, Alan’s analysis is
precisely right; Imperial
simply isn’t offering equal
opportunities to prospec-
tive students from every
background.
However, what I do
have to take argument
with is Alan’s suggestion
that we need to ‘sacri-
fice’ Imperial’s current
location in order to tackle
this problem. I fail to see
how simply moving the
Imperial campus from
one of the most expensive
boroughs to a slightly
cheaper borough whilst
remaining in one of the
most fantastically expen-
sive cities in the world
will make any substantial
difference. Prospective
students will still be
faced by the perception of
‘London Prices’ whether
we are based in White city
or Kensington. Further to
this, the chances are that
the college would struggle
to attract the same talent
it does now because, let’s
be honest, unless you are
really into dual carriage-
ways, the A40 is hardly a
patch on Exhibition Road.
But with all this nega-
tivity let’s take a moment
to consider something
that Imperial already does
really well. The Imperial
Bursary scheme is one
of the most generous
schemes of its kind in the
country, with the most
disadvantaged students re-
ceiving up to £5k on top of
the £11k that they already
receive from the UK
government. This is easily
enough to live a comfort-
able student existence in
Kensington without even
considering potential
earnings over the 3-month
summer break that most
students get. If finance
really is the problem, the
college should promote
their bursary more. It
will almost certainly go
much further to tackling
the inequality problem at
Imperial than decanting
the physics department
into Zone 12.
Not only do I think
Alan’s solution would
be ineffective, I feel it
completely misses the
real point here: dropping
people’s rent by a few
quid a week isn’t the
issue. The issue isn’t that
disadvantaged students
perceive Imperial to be
too expensive, but that
they perceive themselves
to be unlikely to attain
the A*A*A average
offer. For real change
the problem needs to be
tackled twofold, with
policy revised by both
the government and the
college.
Firstly, the College
needs to wake up and
rethink its admissions
policy in order to ensure
that it makes offers to the
most talented students.
According to the In-
stitute of Fiscal Studies,
in the academic year
2015/16 the mean average
spending per head on state
school A-Level students
was of the order of £5k a
year. In contrast, in 2015
average fees for private
day schooling in the UK
stood at a little over £13k,
with some of the leading
public schools charging
substantially more than
this. This vast difference
in spending results in
students from less well-off
areas receiving a consid-
erably inferior education
than those from the more
advantaged backgrounds.
This is particularly true
of applicants to Imperial
from state schools. STEM
subject specialists are
particularly hard to attract
and retain at state schools
due to the significantly
higher salaries which
these staff can attain in
other professions.
By the time UCAS
applications come around,
this vast discrepancy in
educational backgrounds
as likely to excel as those
who scored top marks in
their A-Levels but paid
for the pleasure.
I concede there are
difficulties in identifying
who these talented, but
educationally under-nour-
ished students are, but it
appears Oxford and Cam-
bridge have managed to
succeed in doing so. The
ratio of students admitted
from the most advantaged
to most disadvantaged
backgrounds at the
Oxbridge universities has
fallen significantly over
the last seven years.
Personally, I am of
the opinion that the best
way to identify the best
students is not through
A-Levels, but through
a rigorous and broad
interviewing process.
Admissions tutors, in a
face to face environment,
can much better probe
a student, see how they
understand things and
judge their suitability for
an Imperial degree pro-
gramme. We should not
be making offers to pro-
spective students based
on how many Saturday
classes they have had and
how well they have been
spoon fed A-Level exam
answers.
Although we appear
to be the worst for it, this
isn’t a problem that exists
at Imperial alone. The
problem of the UK’s uni-
versities being dominated
by the privileged few is
a nation-wide problem.
The government needs
to act, investing more
money into state schools
to ensure that all students
have access to the inspir-
ing and well qualified
teachers that they deserve.

“Students from
less well-off
areas receive
a considerably
inferior
education than
those from
privileged
backgrounds”
leads to an equally vast
difference in the quality
of applications between
these students. But
crucially, this difference
in the quality of the ap-
plications is not the same
as a difference in quality
of the applicants! On the
whole, students in state
schools are not any less
intelligent, hard-working,
enthusiastic or driven
than those who have
had a private education.
Give these state schooled
students access to the
same excellent quality
of education (at Imperial
College) and they are just
