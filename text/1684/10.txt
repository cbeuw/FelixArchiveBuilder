A demonstration of what is possible in 24 hours when young, talented minds and litres of Red Bull come together.
L
et’s admit it,
pizza at midnight
is the real driving
force behind the
technological advances
of the past few years. The
Hackathon is essentially
the culture that built the
technological titans of
today - Facebook, Google
and Microsoft. And the
annual hackathlon organ-
ised by DocSoc keeps up
that spirit with IC Hack
18, which returned bigger
and better than ever.
IC Hack 18 only saw
the list of sponsors grow,
with Microsoft being
the title sponsor. Over
300 students, both from
Imperial and other uni-
versities got together to
come up with something
cool, something neat,
something awesome. The
only condition was that
they had only 24 hours
to work on their projects.
Some (including me)
were participating for the
first time, whilst others
were regulars.
Gracing the opening
ceremony was Theo
Blackwell, London’s first
Chief Digital Officer.
He shared about his role
in realising the Mayor’s
ambition to make London
the world’s smartest city,
ensuring that the capital’s
status as a global tech
hub helps transform the
way public services are
designed and delivered,
making them more
accessible, efficient and
responsive to the needs of
Londoners.
At the end of the
Opening Ceremony, after
all the sponsors had shared
about their companies and
what they do, the hacking
began.
The designated hacking
spaces were all over Sher-
field Building, and groups
occupied the Senior
Common Room, Junior
Common Room and the
among participants were
the Crepes, Waffles and
Candy Floss stalls that set
up on Saturday evening.
Nolessimpressivewere
the several workshops
that were held over the
weekend - when partici-
pants weren’t busy trying
to fix their code, they were
kept busy by Microsoft
teaching them how to
use their Azure Cognitive
Services APIs, or hearing
from Ocado Technology
(a Gold Sponsor) about
Scala and functional pro-
gramming. However, the
most popular workshop
didn’t involve any fancy
APIs or even any code.
Next Jump’s Sleep Class
was by far the most
popular workshop, with
demand so high that they
had to have a third run
of the workshop to meet
the demand. Next Jump
staff walked participants
through a 20 minute
session of Yoga Nidra,
which left participants
feeling refreshed enough
to keep them going for the
Queen’s Tower Rooms.
The energy started of
really high - with a variety
of music blasting, thanks
to the crowdsourced
music suggestions that
was run using a Slack
channel.
The scale of IC Hack
is hard to wrap your head
around. How much drinks
does it take to keep over
300 students awake and
active for 24 continuous
hours? Your guess is
probably nowhere near
the actual 2 tonnes of
drinks that was brought in
for the event. The amount
of soft drinks is not as
impressive when you start
considering the thousands
spent on food - the menu
for the weekend included
Nando’s, Domino’s Pizza,
PretAManger and Farmer
J. (Unconfirmed reports
state that American
Express called up one of
the organisers to confirm
that they did really use
their credit card to spend
over £2000 on Nando’s.)
Also highly popular
rest of the long weekend.
Later in the night, Morgan
Stanley hosted a Bar
Night for the participants
in the Imperial College
Union Bar for participants
to take a break from
squashing bugs to social-
ise and enjoy a free drink
on them.
So where did all the
food and the hundreds of
Red Bull cans consumed
go? It went into some
awe-inspired projects that
surprised both students
and sponsors. The teams
submitted the projects that
they worked tirelessly for
24 hours on into different
categories, and 2 finalists
for each category were
selected. Each finalist
group then spent no more
than 2 minutes presenting
and demonstrating their
idea to the audience and
judges, and the winning
team for each category
was chosen at the end of
the Hackathon.
game built with Queen’s
Tower as it’s primary
setting. Fascinatingly, all
the art used in the game
was drawn up by the team
within those 24 hours,
which was definitely a
surprising feat. Winning
the best Mobile Category
App was SugarHon-
eyIceTea, a hilariously
named app that helped
individuals track their
consumption by asking
them to take pictures of
the food and drinks that
they consumed. Winning
Best Game/Augmented
Reality Hack and taking
home Nintendo Switches
was iSpyAI (which I was
part of), a hyperlocal AR
treasure-hunt game where
multiple players would
race to find objects in
their immediate vicinity
to gain points. There were
also sponsor-categories,
such as the TPP Greatest
Impact on Healthcare
category and the Accentu-
re best Ethical/For Good
Hack category.
The logistical sophisti-
cation and the level of or-
ganisation that IC Hack 18
required to run smoothly
was well satisfied by
DocSoc and it’s volun-
teers. Every event during
the weekend started on
time with very little
delays, and the smallest
details weren’t left un-
touched (toothbrushes,
slippers and blankets were
provided for participants
who wanted to catch
some sleep during the
weekend). The coopera-
tion of the sponsors and
the impressive lengths
DocSoc went to make
this event smooth-running
was evident from how en-
joyable IC Hack was. As a
first-time participant at IC
Hack 18, I truly applaud
the spirit behind the
event, and I only wish that
DocSoc organises more
successful hackathons
over the years.

The future of medicine – edible QR codes?

f you are ill, chances
are you would book
an appointment
with your doctor.
They would listen to
your heartbeat, do some
tests and then prescribe
some medicines based on
your symptoms. A trip
to your local pharmacy
would result in a bag full
of medications, some of
which being the ones that
your doctor prescribed
and some that you were
told worked in the same
way as the prescribed
medicines that weren’t in
stock. A week or two into
the treatment, you might
realize that you are still
sick - the antibiotics don’t
work. You aren’t alone -
many people around the
world face this problem.
Thiscouldbebecauseof
many reasons. One reason
is the overuse and misuse
of antibiotics. Some types
of bacteria, single-celled
living organisms, cause
many bacterial infections.
Antibiotics are effective
against such infections
because they kill the
bacteria by stopping their
growth and reproduction.
Nowadays, people are
misusing antibiotics by
over consuming them or
not taking medicines for
the full duration of the
treatment. This results in
the bacteria developing
resistance against the
antibiotic, rendering it
useless.
Also, it is possible that
the prescribed drug just
doesn’t work as effec-
tively as it does in other
people due to genetic or
environmental factors
apart from the overcon-
sumption of drugs. This is
why scientists are looking
towards medications that
are personalized to an in-
dividual, so that the illness
can be treated properly
and more accurately than
it is now.
Another reason is the
consumption of ‘fake’
medicines in developing
countries, which could
contain incorrect doses,
wrong ingredients or no
active ingredients at all.
Even some authorized
medicines fall in this
category because they fail
to meet quality standards.
This might be due to
improperstorage,amongst
other issues. According
to the World Health
Organization (WHO),
these bogus medications
are a growing threat as
increased pharmaceutical
trade, including via the
internet, allows oppor-
tunities for fake drugs to
be distributed. National
health organizations are
trying to find ways to stop
the spread of these drugs.
Scientists and engineers
are trying to find different
types of solutions towards
more personalized medi-
cations and combating the
distribution of fake drugs.
Last Friday, a research
group from University
of Copenhagen and Abo
Akademi University in
Finland shared how they
created a new way to
individualize treatment
- printing medicines in
quick response (QR) code
patterns onto an edible
material.
like websites, emails and
texts. They were invented
in Japan by Denso Wave
Incorporated to address
the main limitation of
barcodes - only being
able to hold around 20
alphanumeric characters
of information. After it
was developed, it was first
used by the automobile
industry. Now, engineers
are testing medicines
printed in that pattern.
The medicines were
printed using inkjet
printing (IJP) technology
to allow for greater flex-
ibility in manufacturing
doses tailored to each
individual. The ink used
had the active pharmaceu-
tical ingredient and it was
printed in the pattern of a
QR code onto a newly de-
veloped porous, flexible,
edible and mechanically
stable substrate with a
good absorption capacity.
The mechanical properties
of the substrate weren’t
affected by the printing
process. The QR code had
good print definition and
it didn’t have significant
edge bleeding.
Professor Jukka
Rantanen working in the
Department of Pharmacy
said: “If we are successful
with applying this produc-
tion method to relatively
simple printers, then it can
enable the innovative pro-
duction of personalized
medicine and rethinking
of the whole supply
chain,”
Due to the shape of the
QR code, data about the
medicine and dosage can
be stored in the pill itself.
Using an app, a quick scan
of the QR code would
give all the information
about the pharmaceutical
product, which could
potentially reduce cases
of wrong or fake medica-
tion being used. The QR
codes are still readable by
smartphones even if the
pills are stored in harsh
conditions.
Researchers hope that,
in the future, the medical
drug can be applied in
the pattern of a QR code
onto the edible material
using a regular printer,
while the material would
be produced in advance
to allow on-demand
production of drugs. Not
only does the technology
take a giant step towards
personalized medicine, it
also proposes a feasible
solution to the problem
of fake drugs. Should
this technology be refined
and used on a widespread
basis, informed decisions
can be made from the
patient’s side in taking
effective medication in
the future.
Edible QR codes can definitely be tasty, but can they help too?// The Land and Water co.
