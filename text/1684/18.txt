We take a look back through the last hundred years of the Academy Awards to see what has changed.

Diversity at the Oscars – how far have we come?

efore 1962,
H o l l y w o o d
didn’t make
many films
about race. This made
some moviegoers unhap-
py. So, they put down their
popcorn, picked up their
picket signs and marched
over to Hollywood
Boulevard demanding
that film studio execu-
tives increase the racial
diversity of characters in
their films. The executives
listened and over the next
few years, racially-diverse
classics such as Lawrence
of Arabia, To Kill a
Mockingbird and Guess
Who’s Coming to Dinner
were greenlit by film
producers. Hollywood
had increased the hetero-
geneity of characters on
the big screen and so the
protesters put down their
picket signs and went
back home.
And for a while, people
were happy. But then they
decided that even though
Hollywood had widened
the representation of
different ethnic groups on
the big screen, they often
portrayed these groups in
an unfavourable light. So,
in the early 1970s, they
once again decided to take
their anger to the streets
of Hollywood. One of the
activists at this time was
Marlon Brando – regular-
ly regarded as one of the
greatest actors of the 20th
century and particularly
famous for his portrayal of
Vito Corleone in The God-
father (1972). Having just
won an Academy Award
for his performance in the
film, Brando declined to
accept his prize “owing
to the poor treatment of
Native Americans in the
film industry”. Instead, the
Native American activist,
Sacheen Littlefeather,
who represented Brando
at the awards ceremony,
used the opportunity to
deliver a fiery rebuke of
the Academy of Motion
Pictures and Arts.
That speech was not an
isolated event, it sparked a
wave of diversity protests
that have been troubling
the Hollywood elite
ever since. Much of the
criticism regarding the
portrayal of non-white
characters in Hollywood
productions began to
centre around the concept
of the “white-saviour”
film – a cinematic trope in
which a white protagonist
is portrayed as a messi-
anic figure who attains
moral enlightenment after
sacrificing a comfortable
livelihood in order to
(physically or morally)
rescue characters of
colour.
Despite the protests, the
white-saviour narrative
gained popularity amongst
audiences. The film that
kicked-off the genre was
the 1962 cinematic ad-
aptation of Harper Lee’s
To Kill a Mockingbird
– a story where a white
lawyer unsuccessfully
defends unfairly accused
black clients but nonethe-
less, receives praise for
his efforts. Even though
the film was successful,
it was only until the late
1980s and early 1990s
that the genre really took
off. During this period,
white-saviour stories
were released frequently
enough for almost every
film in the genre to be rec-
ognized as an instance of
a more specific narrative.
There was the story
about the white coach
that leads inner-city sports
teams to championship
success (Wildcats [1986]
Sunset Park [1996], Glory
Road [2006]); the story
about a white teacher that
sacrifices a comfortable
life in order to educate un-
derprivileged non-white
students (The Principal
[1987], Dangerous Minds
[1995], Finding Forrester
[2000]); the story about
white adventurers that
rescue a benevolent
society from hostile
invaders (Dances with
Wolves [1990], Gran
Torino [2008], Avatar
[2009]); and in homage
to Harper Lee’s epic, the
story about the white
lawyer that defends
unjustly accused Afri-
can-Americans (A Time
To Kill [1996], Amistad
[1997]).
Not all these films
succeeded, but the ones
that did were often
branded by film critics
as earnest attempts to
start a conversation on
race in an industry that
throughout its history,
had failed to capture the
real-life experiences of
non-white communities
in the United States.
Nonetheless, a few critics
contended that while
such films did succeed in
crafting more racially-di-
verse landscapes, they
often did so at the expense
of the very characters that
they were meant to be
about. The claim is that
by depicting non-whites
as dependent on whites,
such films only reinforce
the preconceived bias
that non-white characters
cannot be the agents of
their own destiny. To
give an example, in her
review of the Academy
Award-winning film,
The Blind Side (2009),
in which a white woman
rescues a black teenager
from an impoverished
childhood and supports
him throughout his high
school and college years,
Melissa Anderson, former
senior film critic at The
Village Voice, stated that
“the movie peddles the
most insidious kind of
racism, one in which
whiteys are virtuous
saviours, coming to the
rescue of African-Ameri-
cans who become super-
fluous in narratives that
are supposed to be about
them.”
That view seems
to have become more
popular over time, so
much so that it is now the
norm amongst the liberal
intelligentsia of Holly-
wood. This being the case,
the white-saviour genre
seems to be slowly going
out of fashion in favour of
films that portray people
of colour as their own
heroes – for instance, in
Ava DuVernay’s Selma
(2014), Theodore Melfi’s
Hidden Figures (2016)
and Marvel’s upcoming
feature, Black Panther
(2018).
Indeed, the backlash
against white-saviour
movies has been so intense
that even the seemingly
innocuous musicals, La
La Land (2016) and The
Greatest Showman (2017)

“The Oscars
seem to
be overly
concerned
with whether
a film director
is black or
white, female
or male, Asian
or Hispanic,
young or old”
have been accused of be-
longing to the genre. Last
year, La La Land was the
early front-runner in the
race for the Best Picture
Oscar at the 89th
Academy
Awards, but after a few
critics lamented the lack
of African-Americans in
a film that sees a white
man save jazz, the movie
quickly lost momentum
and eventually, the race.
Instead, Moonlight
(2017) became the first
film with an all-black
cast to win Best Picture;
and even more notably,
the ceremony had the
most black winners of
any Academy Awards,
ever. That is partly a
result of the fact that over
the previous two years,
the Academy had come
under a new wave of more
intense scrutiny for the
lack of racial diversity
among the nominees in
major categories. It wasn’t
something new to them;
the Academy – largely,
white old men in their 60s
– had weathered this type
of storm before.
But unlike previous
waves, this time, the
younger, conventionally
successful, yet disenfran-
chised Hollywood actors
and directors leading
the charge had armies of
Twitter followers behind
them to champion their
cause. As soon as the
nominations for the 87th
and 88th
Academy Awards
were announced, hashtags
like #OscarsSoWhite
and #WhiteOscars began
making rounds amongst
the keyboard activists of
the Twitterverse. Though,
than a game of identity
politics that ignores
artistic masterpieces and
instead rewards the most
vocal identitarian move-
ments. Take, for example,
the newly-minted hashtag
#LatinosLeftOut. The
hashtag, coined in
response to the lack of
Hispanic film-makers
among the recently an-
nounced Oscar nominees,
is yet another example
of how representa-
tion-through-Oscar-nom-
ination is damaging the
future of film. By shaping
the entire conversation
on film industry diversity
around the metric of Oscar
success, the Hollywood
elite have constructed a
zero-sum game that is
trapping them in a vortex
of never-ending diversity
protests. For a black actor
to win, a Hispanic one
must lose; for a female
director to win, a male
one must lose, for a the-
matically-familiar film to
succeed, a more contem-
porary one may have to
fail. It’s getting to a point
where future awards nom-
ination processes may
depend more on activism
against under-representa-
tion than the artistic merits
of a film.
When Ava DuVernay’s
Selma missed out on
Best Picture at the 87th
Academy Awards and
F. Gary Gray’s Straight
Outta Compton wasn’t
nominated for the same
prize the following year,
several liberal media
outlets castigated the
Academy for ignoring
black actors. However, the
problem with such an as-
sessment is that it appears
to fly in the face of the
numbers. African-Amer-
icans constitute 12.6% of
the U.S. population and
since 2000, 10% of Oscar
nominations have gone
black actors. Assuming
that most black actors in
Hollywood are indeed,
African-Americans, then
it appears that black
actors are not really being
ignored by the Academy.
The media pundits pro-
testing under-representa-
tion of different groups
at the Oscars seem to be
overly concerned with
whether a film director is
black or white, female or
male, Asian or Hispanic,
young or old. An artistic
purist would say that
such factors shouldn’t
have much to do with a
film’s chances of Oscar
success. Ava DuVernay’s
omission in the Best
Director category at the
87th
Awards should not be
viewed through the lens
of whether the academy
ignored her because she
is black and female but
should instead be recog-
nized as a unique instance
of a good film-maker
that was not awarded the
recognition she deserved.
Not unlike several other
actors, screenwriters, and
directors that have been
snubbed by the Academy
after producing outstand-
ing work. And this leads
to my last point. There is
no industry on the face of
the Earth that celebrates
itself as much as Hol-
lywood. Awards season
typically kicks off around
November with the
Gotham awards and then
drags on for a further three
months, culminating with
the Oscars at the end of
February. Between those
two events, the eventual
Best Picture winner can
expect to acquire well over
a hundred nominations
at major and semi-major
awards ceremonies,
winning roughly half of
them.
But what is it about
such films that make them
worthy of that coveted
prize of Best Picture?
What magic lies between
those opening and closing
credits that is strong
enough to draw the uni-
versal admiration of the
academy? Well, almost
by definition, artworks
do not lend themselves
to objective assessment;
everybody will have
their own unique opinion
regarding the best films
of the year and those
differences in opinion are
likely to result in some
heated argument among
film critics, professional
film-makers and media
pundits, alike. Some will
praise the summer staple
of superhero-heavy block-
busters, others will brand
them infantile garbage;
some will sing the praises
of avant-garde novelties,
others will dismiss them
as fashionable nonsense
– there is rarely consensus
in art. Even as I write this
piece, there are about
four films that still have
a realistic shot at this
year’s Best Picture prize,
so perhaps the best way
of determining whether
a film is Oscar-worthy,
is to simply try to make
the Academy more rep-
resentative of the wider
Hollywood film industry.
Once that’s done, let the
chips fall where they may.
Current make-up of the Academy // Felix
going by the triumph
of Moonlight at the last
year’s awards, it appears
that this brand of crowd-
sourced criticism has left
a mark.
Certainly, there is
nothing wrong with
having a more diverse
pool of nominees at the
Oscars, but if that comes at
the expense of artistically
superior films, then in a
way, it is a loss for the art
of film altogether. In such
a world, the Oscars are
reduced to nothing more
