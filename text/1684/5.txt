Poor use of statistics is undermining our faith
in public institutions
Politicians have been misuing statistics for too long, and it’s paved the way for the rise of fake
news.

T
he rise of statis-
tics has led to
many benefits
in everyday
life: we use statistics
in medical research to
determine what the best
treatment; they inform
decisions from stock
markets through to how
many pop tarts Walmart
stocks; and, perhaps most
significantly, statistics
shape decisions made by
modern governments such
as which levels of taxa-
tion are required to meet
spending demands and
stimulate the economy.
The kind of Brexit the
UK government should
seek has been thrust into
the spotlight with the
leaking of the statistical
models produced by
the civil service. These
suggest that all forms of
Brexit would harm the
UK economy and the
UK must have as close a
relationship with the EU
to save it from the worst
of these consequences.
Several individuals and
groups have lined up to
criticise the work as mis-
leading and politically
motivated, including
one of the government’s
own Brexit ministers.
Recently there’s been
a growing backlash
against statistics, at first
from the public, and now,
more worryingly, from
politicians. However,
this is the fault of politi-
cians themselves.
Politicians of
all stripes hide behind
misleading statistic
after misleading statistic
to justify their policy
positions. This can be
most evidently seen at
Prime Minister’s Ques-
tions (PMQs) every
week. During PMQs on
the 25th
of January this
year the Prime Minister
trotted out the follow-
ing statistic in relation
to A&E services: “In
England 497 people
were waiting more than
12 hours, but the latest
figures also show that,
under the Labour Gov-
ernment in Wales, 3,741
people were waiting
more than 12 hours.”
What the Prime Minister
failed to mention was
that these figures aren’t
even comparable. In
England, the clock starts
only once a patient has
had an initial assessment
by a doctor, while in
Wales the clock starts
the moment someone
walks through the door
in A&E. The intentional
misuse of statistics such
as this causes several
problems.
At PMQs, neither the
Prime Minister nor the
Leader of the Oppo-
sition spend any time
answering questions. All
that appears to happen
is Corbyn throws a
question wrapped up
with some statistic at
Teresa May, which she
will entirely fail to
answer, instead retort-
ing with contradictory
and apparently equally
truthful information.
This does nothing to get
to the nub of the issue
or inform the public,
leading to poor govern-
ance and poor policy;
flaws and criticisms are
not given the careful
consideration needed to
ensure the best outcome
as politicians swat away
any issue with the use of
a few facts and figures.
This undermines the role
of Parliament and the
crucial work it must do
in holding the govern-
ment and the executive
has been a push back
against “experts” which
has been seen in the
vote for Brexit, Trump,
and even in medicine,
where experts have been
portrayed as out of touch
and callous. Cases such
as Charlie Gard and
Alfie Evans, which has
itself spawned “the Alfie
Army” to help fight off
the nasty clinicians who
are apparently out to kill
Alfie, are indicative of
this trend. The rise of
alternative therapies,
such as homeopathy
and Gwyneth Paltrow’s
Goop, fits with the
pattern. When the
veracity of fact has been
abused so abundantly it
becomes increasingly
easier for fringe groups
to release information
that is intentionally
misleading or “fake
news”, as the ability to
decipher the truth from
fiction has already been
undermined by the main-
stream media and politi-
than what might garner
them more support at
the polls according to
their spin doctors and
focus groups. Ideally
politicians should utilise
all the information at
hand to make the deci-
sions they see fit. The
honest use of statistics
would lead to better
outcomes for govern-
ment, allowing it to
react and develop policy
to clearly tackle the
real challenges the UK
faces. The government
and politicians could
lead from the front,
demonstrating the good
work facts and figures
can and should do. They
could roll back the tide
of “fake news” and the
war against experts. Un-
fortunately, politicians
appear unable to do this.
If they left statistics
alone the purity of fact
would be restored for
the rest of us to enjoy
and prosper from.
Why have we had enough of experts, Mr Gove? // Wikimedia
cians. This sorry state of
affairs is epitomized by
tools such Channel 4’s
FactCheck, which nobly
attempts to explain the
truth behind some of the
statistics politicians and
others use. Its utility and
existence highlight the
fact that statistics are
now unfortunately often
half-truths, mis-truths or
entirely untrue.
Perhaps statistics
should be taken out
of politics altogether.
They very rarely appear
to inform the debate,
but are rather utilized
as a smokescreen to
deceive the public.
Statistics should be used
to inform government
policy rather than be
manipulated and mis-
represented to justify
poor policy after the
fact. Politics devoid of
statistics would see pol-
iticians make decisions
based off of what they
believed to be right by
moral principle rather
“Misuse of
statistics
erodes the
public’s faith,
not just in
politics, but in
other areas of
life too”
to account.
This behaviour erodes
away the public’s faith
in statistics, which has
ramifications, not just
in politics but other
parts of life too. There
