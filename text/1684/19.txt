Phantom Thread: A haunting masterpiece
Sir Daniel Day-Lewis bows out on a high as Paul Thomas Anderson returns with the best film of the year.
T
hough he ex-
celled as a young
actor in the
National Youth
Theatre, in 1975 Daniel
Day-Lewis made a deci-
sion that almost deprived
us of some of the very
greatest performances
ever seen on screen. Then
an unruly 18 year old,
Day-Lewis elected not to
pursue the arts, instead
applying for a five year
apprenticeship as a cabi-
net-maker. Fortunately for
cinephiles everywhere, he
was rejected due to lack
of experience. Instead he
was accepted at the Bristol
Old Vic Theatre School,
and the rest is history.
Day-Lewis’ passion for
the crafts is well known –
a dedicated woodworker,
he also once worked as a
road-cobbler in Tuscany
for 18 months during
one of his notoriously
long lay-offs between
acting jobs. He uses this
love to aid his portrayal
in Phantom Thread of a
fastidious haute couture
dressmaker in the high
society glamour of 1950s
London as he heads into
his longest lay-off of all:
retirement.
The couturier at the
centre of this tale is
the wonderfully named
Reynolds Woodcock.
He operates a fashion
salon from his towering
Georgian townhouse
in Fitzroy Square that
very closely resembles
the Saville Row house
of Sir Hardy Amies, the
man behind the crisp,
understated looks of the
“Anderson’s
screenplay
is endlessly
surprising,
weaving in
directions one
never predicts”
Queen’s early reign. As
ever with Anderson, his
lead is an amalgamation
of a number of fascinat-
ing true life figures. In
The Master, Lancaster
Dodd was a mashup of
L. Ron Hubbard and
John Steinbeck; here,
Woodcock is drawn from
the likes of Cristóbal
Balenciaga, Christian
Dior, and Charles James.
As Reynolds goes about
his day with extreme
routine and superstition –
including silent breakfasts
– his sister Cyril, played
by the wonderful Lesley
Manville with icy aplomb,
tends to both his pernick-
ety needs and the logistical
side of the business. Early
on, Reynolds takes a trip
to the country for some
rest from his exhaustingly
procedural life, where he
meets young immigrant
waitress Alma, giving
her the sexiest breakfast
order ever on screen. He
is instantly taken by her,
early on telling her “I
feel I’ve been looking for
you for a very long time”,
and whisks her back to
his London lair after a
peculiar first date.
To delve into the plot
any further would be a
miscarriage of justice.
Anderson’s screenplay
is endlessly surprising,
weaving in directions
one could never predict
as Reynolds and Alma
battle for control over
their lives, with Cyril –
Reynold’s old so-and-so
as he affectionately refers
to her – watching over
with an eagle eye. The
film ensues like a dark
fairy tale, most closely
resembling Rebecca, but
comparable in different
ways to Sunset Boulevard,
All About Eve, and The
Red Shoes. It is haunted,
paying tribute to the likes
of Kubrick, Hitchcock,
and the Brothers Grimm
at different times, and
yet it is incredibly funny.
In particular Manville
delivers her put downs
with a razor sharp tongue,
in some of the most
memorable lines of an
astonishingly quotable
film, especially consid-
ering Anderson’s intense
appreciation of moments
of quiet and silence.
The whole picture sees
technical masters at the
top of their game. Aside
from Anderson’s writing
and directing, and the re-
markable performances of
Day-Lewis, Manville, and
relative newcomer Krieps
(who commendably holds
her own against one of the
finest actors ever to grace
the screen), Anderson also
serves as his own cine-
matographer, conjuring
pristine shots from the
shadowy corners of the
town house, adding to the
gothic feel of the picture.
Jonny Greenwood’s score
is a thing of beauty, mixing
muted, creepy piano
with soaring, romantic
strings; meanwhile
Dylan Tichenor’s editing
is clean and rhythmic.
The costume design and
production design, from
Mark Bridges and Mark
Tildesley respectively, are
simply sublime.
Anderson, like
Day-Lewis, was a tremen-
dous young talent, having
achieved more in his
twenties than many great
directors do in their entire
careers. He is a filmmaker
synonymous with great
American stories, particu-
larly those set in his home
state of California: a meg-
alomaniac oil baron going
head to head with a young,
charismatic preacher
at the turn of the 20th
century; the beginnings of
a scientology-like cult in
a United States suffering
from an identity crisis
post-war; a young man
desperately crying out for
a family and finding one
in the Los Angeles porn
scene in the late seventies.
Departing his home state
for the first time ever, he is
at the peak of his powers,
eschewing the vast land-
scapes of the Valley for
his most intimate film
yet. Both Anderson and
Day-Lewis are obsessive-
ly driven, reclusive men,
only focused on the work,
and never seeking fame
or celebrity, making their
combination the only one
that could have worked so
well in bringing the world
of Reynolds Woodcock to
life. Where they differ is
on their desire to continue
working. Day-Lewis
is quite possibly burnt
out from the undeniably
demanding way in which
he becomes the great men
he portrays. On the other
hand, Anderson, who has
never held another job
than being a filmmaker,
insists that he will go on
making films as long as he
is allowed to. Long may
he continue.
