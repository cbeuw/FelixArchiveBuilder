efore visiting
Los Angeles,
I had heard
n u m e r o u s
stories of how utterly
disappointing the city is
since “there’s nothing to
do there”. But if you are
determined to make the
most of your trip, you can
always find something
interesting – for instance,
besides the usual tourist
spots, you can visit one
of the famous talk shows
to be given a first-hand
experience of how things
work off-screen. When I
was in LA, I went to the
Jimmy Kimmel Live show
and it was indeed one of
the highlights of my trip!
Somewhat surprisingly,
you can’t really buy tickets
to such shows – instead,
you enter a competition
by registering your details
online and telling them
why you’d like to win.
If you’re lucky, you’ll
receive the tickets to your
email account for free.
We applied for a couple
of shows on different
days and won 2 tickets to
Jimmy Kimmel Live, but
only found out the line
up a few days before the
recording – actor Larry
David and animal trainer
Dave Salmoni.
On the day of the
show, we received an
email saying we had
been upgraded to priority
tickets. That meant we
were one of the first
people to enter the venue,
which is located in the
very centre of the Hol-
lywood Boulevard, with
Jimmy Kimmel’s star
just at its doorsteps. As
we were waiting outside
in the queue, the staff
members approached us
one by one to check our
tickets and explained
some basic rules – from
the moment we entered
the venue, taking pictures
or videos was strictly
prohibited. We were also
asked to leave our bags
at the entrance. Besides
the priority and regular
ticket holders, there were
several people without
tickets, waiting to join the
audience should any seats
remain unfilled.
Upon entering the
actual studio, the audience
members were seated by
the crew based on their
preference.Therulesofthe
show were then explained,
and we soon realized
that all the clapping
and chanting from the
audience is staged: we
were asked to follow two
signs – “Applause” and
“Stop clapping” – that
were hanging from the
ceiling and would light
up throughout the show.
When Kimmel entered the
stage, our clapping and
shouting was supposed
to be so loud that it was
impossible to hear him
for the first 15 seconds.
We were then asked to
gradually fade out when
the “Stop Clapping” sign
lit up, rather than ending
suddenly, to make it sound
more realistic on TV.
Bell, who was helping out
elderly people who had
been relocated from a re-
tirement home to her hotel
in Florida. News reports
on the hurricane were
then shown, before Jimmy
moved on to interviewing
the guests – Larry David
introduced his upcoming
TV series, while Dave
Salmoni brought some
extra-venomous snakes,
and a few other animals.
During one of the breaks
between filming, Kimmel
remained on stage and
had an off-the-record
conversation with an
audience member who
had fled Florida to escape
the hurricane. He seemed
genuinely interested and
concerned with the situa-
tion. During other breaks,
another crew member
chatted with the audience,
keeping us entertained
by asking questions and
giving out some prizes.
Finally, after the show,
we were invited to listen to
the rapper 21 Savage, who
performed on the stage
outside the studio. Not
being huge fans, we left
after two songs, but there
were people outside the
venue, peeping through
the holes in the fence and
trying to get a glimpse of
the performance.
It was very inter-
esting to see how such
successful shows work,
with everything being
carefully planned, down
to the last detail. It was
also surprising to realise
that the show needed
the audience more than
the audience needed
the show. So if you’re
interested in showbiz or
find yourself in LA with
‘nothing to do’, I would
strongly recommend
visiting one of these talk
shows – you’ll get a sneak
peek of how things work
backstage and might even
see some of your favour-
ite celebrities. After all,
Hollywood is famous for
its film industry, and is so
much more than just stars
on the pavement or the
sign on the hill.
If you head to Los Angeles, as well as seeing the Hollywood sign, you should try and check out the filming of a TV
show, to glimpse the machine behind the magic.

“Everything

detail”
The show itself was
much shorter than the
waiting and preparation
time, and, though I believe
it was shown on TV that
same night, it wasn’t in
fact “live”. Three cameras
filmed the stage and the
audience from different
angles, and there were
four parts of filming with
short breaks in between.
Since the filming
happened while Hurri-
cane Irma was hitting
Florida, the show was
mostly focussed on that.
Kimmel firstly had a live
chat with the actor Kristen
