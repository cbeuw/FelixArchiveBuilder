For BUCS sake!
Rain, mud, Oasis, face paint, baking, and a river crossing on ICXCAC’s trip to BUCS XC.

L
ast weekend,
ICXCAC took
on the BUCS
Cross-Country
Championships, along
with other universities
from all around the
UK. Imperial fielded a
staggering 63 runners –
ICXCAC’s largest BUCS
team to date and the larg-
est of all teams competing
on Saturday!
The club’s members
awoke early on Saturday
morning, fuelled by
the carb-loading from
the night before, and
drearily made their way
to Beit for the scheduled
8:30am departure to
Uxbridge – the home of
hosts Brunel – leaving
enough time to apply the
obligatory matching face
paint, complete a range
of challenges involving
cocoa powder, and get the
team’s spirits up.
When the athletes
arrived in Uxbridge, they
made their way to the

river-crossing awaited
them, and the lap ended
with a final kilometer
through the woods.
The first event of the
day was the women’s
race, which began at noon.
After a brief warm-up,
and with the drizzle
still falling, Imperial’s
25-strong women’s team
headed to the starting
line where a mighty 718
competitors had lined
up. Overall, Imperial’s
women posted some very
strong performances in
the 6.5km race with Sarah
Johnson leading the team
home in 37th
position,
followed by Georgia
Curry in 98th. Hyde Park
Relays organiser Kate
Olding then came in 118th
,
followed by Sarah Grover
in 131st
, Women’s Captain
Anna Lawson in 159th
,
Amy Davila in 185th
,
along with the whole of
the women’s team who
all ran fantastically and
achieved amazing results
individually and as a team.
The race schedule was
action-packed and, with
the crowd still breathless
from the women’s race,
the men’s A race was
ready to begin with 360
runners lining up this
time. This race was the
day’s longest: the runners
faced a brutal 10km of
hardcore cross-country
running with the mud
becoming harder and
harder to run on. Overall,
ICXCAC performed out-
standingly in yet another
race as club-legend
Chris Olley inspired his
teammates by finishing in
a spectacular 2nd place,
followed closely by 10km
-road-specialist Luke
Caldwell in an excellent
6th place. The team was
rounded off by Oliver
Newton coming in 81st
,
Nikhil Faulkner in 129th
,
Harry Scriven in 142nd
,
and Trail Captain Henry
Hart in 167th
.
Finally, it was time for
the men’s B race, which
fielded nearly 600 runners.
Slightly shorter than the
men’s A race, the 7.9km
race was in undoubtedly
the poorest conditions of
the day meaning it would
not be a pleasure cruise:
not a single patch of dry
ground or grass could be
seen throughout the course
and the rain continued to
pour. For this reason, the
team was as cheerful and
motivated as ever as they
went on to encourage the
28 final Imperial runners
throughout their grueling
race. Overall the team
completed the course with
great results, with Daniel
Ayers in 141st
, Club Sec-
retary Fergus Johnson in
155th
, Kirill Mikhaylov
in 182nd
, Men’s Captain
Lewis Jackson in 187th
,
Duncan Hunter in 215th
,
Edmund Jones in 286th
,
and all the rest of the
men’s B team that took
part in this tough race:
showing all the other uni-
versities what ICXCAC
are capable of!
After these outstanding
performances, the team
got together for the tradi-
tional post-racing baking
binge, featuring muffins,
meringues, macarons,
and avocado bread among
other millennial delica-
cies.
Following this, the
awards ceremony began,
and as Chris Olley
received his medal,
Imperial probably should
have won gold for the
huge cheer that was
provided.
From there, the squad
headed in the local pub’s
direction, to enjoy a well-
earned rest as well as the
joys of electric heating.
After a few refreshing
beverages, it was time
to take the bus towards a
local curry house, where
the sturdy runners would
refuel with an all-you-
can-eat buffet.
After returning to
Uxbridge and befriending
the Bristol and Notting-
ham teams in the pub,
the runners headed to the
much-anticipated BUCS
after-party at Brunel’s
Student Union. After
making it past some rather
unwelcoming bouncers,
the Student Union offered
four rooms of music,
including a Silent Disco,
giving ICXCAC the
chance to show its skills
on the dancefloor late into
the night.
The next morning,
those who managed to
wake up early enough
made it to Men’s Captain
Lewis Jackson’s house for
a Sunday breakfast “run”,
although the run was
almost entirely replaced
with Oasis and toast.
All in all, Imperial
could not have asked for a
better day out – outstand-
ing performances and
undeniable banter: ICXC
at its finest.

Once the team had
arrived at the course, they
set up camp with their new
club flag flying high and
quickly went on a walking
tour of the course. Starting
in a field, the course began
with two kilometers of
mild cross-country condi-
tions before ascending the
notorious ‘ski slope’: a
slippery, steep, and narrow
section that makes even
the most hardened runner
question their motivation
for running. Further along
