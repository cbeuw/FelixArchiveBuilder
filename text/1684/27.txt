ICSF DO PICOSOC!
After an exciting year
of festive socials, leaky
libraries, and trips to
see some of the biggest
film releases in decades,
Imperial College Science
Fiction and Fantasy
Society (ICSF) is finally
approaching their biggest
event of the year. Bringing
together over 100 fans of
science fiction and fantasy
from within Imperial and
without, the 35th
annual
Picocon – our very own
science fiction convention
– will happen on Saturday
the 17th
of February.
This year, ICSF is
playing host to the
creative partnership of
Paul Stewart and Chris
Riddell, whose most
notable creations include
The Edge Chronicles
series and Muddle Earth;
the award winning and
multi-talented Emma
Newman, who has
worked with both novels
and audiobook narration;
and the eternal favourite
Ben Aaronovitch, whose
work includes two Doctor
Who serials, several
spin-off novels, and his
best-selling series Rivers
of London. Featuring
talks from our guests of
honour and a panel event
where you can put your
own questions to the
assembled authors, this
year’s con promises to
cover diverse topics from
the written and spoken
word to illustration and
the silver screen. There’s
also an opportunity to
smash some truly rep-
rehensible merchandise
with a giant hammer and
a bucket of liquid nitrogen
whilst being egged on by
Stuart Ashen, as well as
to contribute money to
charity in order to stop
people reading sections
of There’s a Bitcoin in my
Butt and He is Handsome.
The day is rounded off by
a pub quiz featuring an
edible prize, and definite-
ly no fish duels take place.
The Picocon subcom-
mittee is currently looking
for volunteers to help run
the event, so if you fancy
free entry in exchange for
a few hours of moving
tables around, get in touch
with the chair of the sub-
committee at picocon@
icsf.co.uk.
Tickets (£10 for
students) are available on
the Union Website, but

FEMSOC TACKLE
SEXUAL VIOLENCE
they’re available at the
door outside Blackett on
Saturday morning. The
event is open to all, and as
always tickets are cheaper
for society members –
membership also comes
with the ability to borrow
any of our 10,000 books
or 600 DVDs (including
work by all of this year’s
guests of honour) from our
dedicated library, which is
located off Beit Quad and
is open every weekday
1 in 5 women aged 16
- 59 has experienced some
form of sexual violence
since the age of 16.
It’s finally gaining
attention in the news, but
what can we, as students,
do to make a difference?
Join IC FemSoc and share
your ideas, whether it’s
ways of raising aware-
ness, changing policy,
or practical solutions to
make people feel safer.
Join a group of like-mind-
ed people and join forces
to work on ideas to make
a difference.
FemSoc has run
several events this year,
including an introduction
to feminism, a TED-talk
event and, our first col-
laboration of the year, a
discussion with the new
Kinky Klub on feminism
and kink. We’re a relent-
lessly sex-positive society,
famous for handing out
free condoms and dental
dams at Freshers’ Fair and
at our events. But talking
about sexism is impos-
sible without talking
about sexual assault and
violence, especially when
its been so prevalent in the
news. This is the first of
several events planned by
IC FemSoc to look at how
we, as Imperial students,
can make a tangible
difference. Being the
hotbed of innovation that
it is, we’re sure Imperial
is the perfect place to start
coming-up with new and
innovative ways to tackle
sexual assault. So come
along to 630 Blackett on
12th February at 6.00pm
and join like-minded
to come-up with ways
to tackle this problem
and help them become a
reality.
