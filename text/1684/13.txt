Gandhi opera Satyagraha returns to London
T
his year brings
with it the highly
anticipated third
revival of Philip
Glass’s iconic Satyagra-
ha, an epic opera based
on Mahatma Gandhi’s
memoir My Experiments
with Truth. Since its UK
première 11 years ago,
which broke box office
records for 20th
century
opera, Satyagraha, which
follows the beginnings
of Gandhi’s political
activism based on princi-
ples of civil disobedience
and non-violence in South
Africa, has sustained its
status as the most popular
contemporary work to
be performed by English
National Opera.
The production is
directed by Phelim Mc-
Dermott and designed by
Julian Crouch, co-found-
ers of theatre company
Improbable. The scenery
and puppetry on stage is
manipulated with mastery,
however conductor Karen
Kamensek, a Glass spe-
cialist, commands her or-
chestra with precision and
steadiness, which at times
eclipses the happenings
on stage.
The libretto is sung
in Sanskrit, based
on excerpts from the
Bhagavad Gita, without
surtitles. Occasionally,
quotations are projected
onto the stage, providing
introspective material for
the audience rather than
narrative guidance. Un-
deniably, it is a work that
requires you to rewatch it
in order to peel back the
layers of meaning.
Glass composed a
trilogy of operas based on
individuals who changed
the world, of which Sat-
yagraha is one. Einstein
on the Beach (1976) is the
first and Akhnaten (1984)
the last.
Set in South Africa
between 1896 and 1913,
Satyagraha – the truth
force – explores Gandhi’s
peaceful resistance
against the discrimination
he observed. In a world
where violence and social
discrimination remain
ever-relevant, we turn to
Gandhi’s idea of ‘truth-
force’ and Tolstoy’s ‘uni-
versal love’ for solace.
The concept of sat-
yagraha is often misun-
derstood to be limited to
passive resistance. One
of the first scenes in the
opera is at Tolstoy farm,
where Gandhi and his
allies form a commune
and commit to not only
work on the commune, but
also on their own spiritual
development. They vow
to resist the enemy, but do
so from a place of love,
this commitment, they
declare, is the spirit of
‘satyagraha’.
Stillness descends over
the London Coliseum,
only to be interrupted by
the repeating motifs of
the cello. Toby Spence’s
powerful voice adds to the
crescendo and the stage
gradually comes to life.
The distinguished tenor
is a worthy successor to
Alan Oke who retired
from the role of M.K.
Gandhi, one he had held
since the 2007 première,
Toby Spence, distin-
guished London-based
tenor flawlessly preserves
the legacy. His grounded
voice provides constancy
on the ever-changing
stage. In his role as
Arjuna, the prince at the
heart of the Hindu epic
Mahabharata, Eddie
Wade’s booming baritone
voice harmonises beau-
tifully with Spence’s as
they meditatively chant in
Sanskrit.
Each act is inspired by
one of the three icons of
Satyagraha – Gandhi’s
inspiration Leo Tolstoy,
his contemporary and
confidante Rabindranath
Tagore, and the man who
carried Gandhi’s legacy
during the American Civil
Rights movement, Martin
Luther King Jr. In ground-
ing the opera in these
individuals, Glass is able
to appreciate the conti-
nuity of the principles of
satyagraha through time,
place, culture and person.
The first act, aptly
named Tolstoy, reminds
us of the essential bond
between Russian novelist
and a young Gandhi, who
founded his ideas about
non-violence on Tolstoy’s
theories on universal love.
Tolstoy’s letters to Gandhi
were a source of reassur-
ance and counselling to
the young leader. This
relationship defines the
eternal nature of ‘truth
force’ that spans across
nations.
The second act is
inspiredbyIndianpoetand
philosopher Rabindranath
Tagore, who earned the
1913 Nobel Prize for
literature. He sits in an
alcove above the stage,
allowing the audience to
acknowledge the long
relationship between
himself and Gandhi. Act
II is filled with pivotal
scenes that give it a more
dramatic tone than the first
act. The presence of Mrs
Alexander (Sarah Pring),
the wife of the Durban
police superintendent who
defended Gandhi from a
mob, provides the most
climactic scene of the
act. The mezzo soprano
Philip Glass’ iconic work offers a unique opportunity to experience contemporary opera at its finest.

SATYAGRAHA
“Distinguished
tenor Toby
Spence is
a worthy
successor to
Alan Oke”
dominates the stage with
her presence; Pring’s
performance is power-
fully emotive: when the
momentum she creates
is lost, the audience is
left demoralised by the
apparent defeat of the
“good” forces of the
world.
Glass’s music has
historically been a source
of controversy amongst
audiences. Akin to Steve
Reich, the pioneer of min-
imalism, some consider
Glass’s compositions too
monotonous, repetitive
and almost chafing.
However, in Satyagraha,
his minimalist approach,
which he prefers to
describe as “music with
repetitive structure” could
not be better suited to
complement and enhance
the prevailing theme of
the ‘truth force’. Glass’
Buddhist beliefs echo
throughout the perfor-
mance, reflected by the
intensely meditative
chanting of excerpts from
the Bhagavad Gita.
Satyagraha offers
a unique and rare op-
portunity to experience
contemporary opera at its
finest.
