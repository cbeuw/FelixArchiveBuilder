Turtle time – IC Sailing excelling in the boats and bars
The trip to Warwick was made worth it after a great night with “eliminator”, and by them placing high in the
rankings.

L
ast weekend the
Imperial College
Sailing Club sent
three teams of six
sailors to compete at the
Warwick Turtle hosted by
the Warwick University
Sailing Club. Most of the
team members hopped
on the minibus at 5 am
Saturday morning, with
the mission to beat the
remaining members
comfortably driving by
car. Those on the minibus
were instead graced with a
fantastic music selection,
the continuous chat pro-
vided by Aidan (our social
sailor and second team
captain, out of action due
to being punched in the
face by a Chelsea fan), but
most importantly, a taste
of Fraser’s exemplary
driving.
Upon our arrival to
Draycote Water, we
saw the morning breeze
picking up. The wind
conditions however were
the least of our concerns
when we realised one of
our second team’s crews,
Michal Wojnowski, was
“The cocktail
masked a
substantial
amount of
spirits under
the flavour of
orange squash
and‘Blue Bolt’
energy drink”
“ICSC finished
in a highly
respectable
second
position
overall”
nowhere to be seen. It
later transpired that he had
a fun night out at Oxford,
attempted to climb
over the fence of Christ
College and missed his
ride to Warwick with the
Oxford sailing team.
Despite this, racing
had to go on. Third team
crew, Radhika, tempo-
rarily joined second team
(Imperial White) to race
against our first team
(Imperial Blue) in the
first race of the whole
event. Luck wasn’t on
her side, however, as
both her and Ariane from
Imperial White ended up
the water after capsizing
soon after the rounding
the second mark of the
race. This was more than
enough of an advantage
for the Blues to finish in
a winning combination
with boats in 1st, 2nd and
3rd places. Apart from
temperamental winds, our
teams were also dealing
with a biased umpire –
Aidan, our injured second
team captain was also
umpiring the event, and in
our opinion, did not do a
very good job of it!
The day progressed as
the teams battled strong
winds and got used to
racing in different con-
ditions and competing
against different teams.
The racing finished for
the day around mid-af-
ternoon, when the sun
had already set, and our
sailing kit was sufficiently
wet from hiking out on the
boats, the persistent rain,
and earlier capsizes.
As per usual, the
evening social demanded
the participants to show
up in attributed costumes.
Our teams brought their
most improvised game
in the disguises of; the 3
little pigs, blind mice and
Pinocchio. The traditional
curry meal served both
as comfort food from an
exhaustive day, and a
place to start pre-ing for
the night ahead. Shout out
to Warwick University
Sailing Club for providing
us with copious amounts
of their famous beverage
aptly named “Eliminator”.
Despite each sailor being
allocated a generous 1 litre
portion of the drink, many
bottles were stolen from
other teams and could be
found hidden under the
table. The cocktail masked
a substantial amount of
spirits under the flavour of
orange squash and ‘Blue
Bolt’ energy drink and our
social sec, Aidan, made
sure every sailor had a
sufficient quantity of it
before we left the curry
house. The rest of the
night comes in separate
flashbacks to most of
the team members, but
everyone was sure to have
had a splendid night out at
Warwick.
Sunday morning didn’t
allow any time for a
hangover, as the 3 teams
had to wake up at 7.30
am for a bright and early
start to sailing. The results
from the previous day
re-distributed our teams in
different fleets; Imperial
Blue were in Gold fleet
aiming to get into finals,
while Imperial White
and Red were sailing
in Bronze fleet and had
more room to play new
tactics whilst still getting
positive results. With
longer waits in between
races due to even stronger
wind conditions, some
of our sailors were keen
on getting more time
on the water by joining
other teams with missing
members. Toby Freeland,
one of Imperial White’s
helms, decided to sail
with the Swansea alumni
team. We unwittingly
discovered on the water
that he was sailing against
Imperial Blue in the
semi-finals match of the
whole competition. This
prompted calls of “you
better capsize Toby” and
“if you win a race you’re
not getting a ride back to
London” from members
of Imperial Blue. Luckily,
Imperial Blue easily
breezed through the
semi-finals but unfortu-
nately lost to Magdalene
College School in a
closely fought finals with
very strong winds and
dubious decisions from
the umpires to finish in a
highly respectable second
position overall.
The event was a fan-
tastic way to get ready for
BUSA Qualifiers (more
about that next week),
and overall a weekend
full of great sailing and
socialising. Many thanks
to the University of
Warwick Sailing Club for
organising the event and
hosting our teams. See
you all next year! Thank
you Rooster Sailing for
supplying our club with
kit!

Boxing returns tri-
umphant - winning
Gold and Bronze
in the National BUCS
Championships. The
competition had 180+
participants from 50+
universities and colleges
across the U.K. including
top sporting universities
such as Loughborough
and Nottingham. It was
the first time that Imperial
sent out any fighters and
we came back with two
national champions!

Three of IC Boxing’s
best, Aileen Cooney,
Daniel Burridge and
Spencer Song travelled to
Staffordshire University
last weekend for the three-
day event. Accompanying
them was Coach George
Burton, ex-GB Olympic
trainer, who has provided
a tremendous support, dis-
cipline and passed down
a heck of a lot of boxing
wisdom to everyone he
has trained.
The event began on
“Cooney has
a distinctive
style, bursting
with energy
and fire”
Friday the 2nd followed
by semi-finals and finals
over the following two
days. Burridge and
Cooney made it through
to semi-finals and finals,
respectively, and an un-
fortunate disqualification
made Song unable to
continue through to the
later stages.
Cooney, 24, from
London/Ireland brought
home Gold after an
overriding win against
Birmingham’s Mairi
Kerin in the semi’s and a
fiery, adrenaline-fuelled
in the last 10 seconds of
madness.
The judges made a
Miss Universe style
mistake, announcing the
wrong winner before
re-crowning Cooney as
the true overall champion.
(She was tremendously
modest about the whole
ordeal, even though it was
indisputable that she had
won the first two rounds).
Burridge, 19, from
Chalfont St. Peter, Buck-
inghamshire, took home
Bronze after stepping
up his game in a tough
fight against 25-year-old,
3-time BUCS boxing
champion, Adinoyi Ozigi,
from Nottingham Trent
Uni. Burridge put up a
good fight going toe-to-
toe against such a formi-
dable fighter. His resil-
ience outshone any other
competitor - managing to
fight his way through two
gruesomely exhausting
3-minute rounds before
being technically KOed
– all with a smile on his
face. (Although a doctor
Daniel Burridge (Bronze medallist for Men’s Open, 69-75kg, 11-20 bouts), Imperial
Coach George Burton and Aileen Cooney (Gold medallist for Women’s Novice, 54-57kg,

might say those punches
just made him a bit loopy!)
Burridge still boasts
an impressive record
of 16 bouts. After only
beginning his first year of
Mechanical Engineering
in October, he is looking
to be one of the top pros-
pects for IC Boxing Club.
Song, 22, from China,
made a great start,

finale against Sheffield
Hallam’s Dayna Antcliffe.
Cooney’s record now sits
at a 100% win-rate of 4
bouts and 4 wins.
Cooney has a dis-
tinctive style, bursting
with energy and fire.
She stepped forward and
gained control in the ring
by pushing the pace and
keeping her opponent on
the back foot. She took
winning the first round
by a longshot of his fight
vs Harry Pendered-Mazer
from Loughborough.
He is notorious for his
smooth moves – and
by that, I mean he’s a
constant moving target,
so opponents find it near
impossible to connect
any punches to his face
(nothing to do with his
charming mannerisms).
Unfortunately, after the
second round begun his
long locks got in the way
and the referee deemed
it unsafe to continue,
disqualifying Song for not
having a ‘fresh’ enough
trim. Coach George will
be taking him to his local
barbershop in Brixton
before his next fight!
Nonetheless, he fought
extremely well and it was
a real shame that he wasn’t
allowed to continue as he
was looking to be a real
contender in making it
through to the final stages!
“The final
round ended
with a flurry of
punches in the
last 10 seconds
of madness”

as if they were nothing
and just continued to
throw combination after
combination - ducking,
dodging and ending with
her powerful right hook.
