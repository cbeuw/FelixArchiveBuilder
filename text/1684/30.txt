S
tudents were left
upset and trau-
matised earlier
this week by a
hell-portal to the Neth-
erworld, which opened
after both sets of Central
Library doors were
opened at once.
On Tuesday morning,
library staff inadvertently
opened both sets of doors
leading out from the main
entrance onto Queens’
Lawn. About five minutes
after this, students in
the Wolfson Suite re-
ported hearing demonic
voices coming through
their computer sound
systems, while several
Central Library cafe staff
members spontaneously
combusted. By midday,
a hole had developed in
the fabric of space-time,
through which effluxed
rivers of blood.
While the majority of
the library staff fled and/
or were sucked into the
portal, a few remained
working, despite the rising
temperatures, which
rendered the new climate
control measures ineffec-
tual. “I told them not to
open both sets of doors,”
Caroline Foley, Head
of Library Maintenance
Services, told Hangman,
“it’s written in the new
employee handbook that
doing so establishes a con-
nection with the demonic
realm, but I know some
staff never bother reading
through the fine print.”
Kieran Laughlan, Vice
Provost (Purgatorial Ser-
vices), spoke to Hangman
about the incident:
“earlier this week, staff
members accidentally
created a portal to a hellish
dimension. The College
quickly got the situation
under control, and have
erected a cordon around
the area. Students will be
able to enter the library
through the side entrance,
and we apologise for any
disruption to their studies.
Imperial takes the health
and safety of staff and stu-
dents as its highest priori-
ty, and we will be taking
steps to ensure no more
students are possessed.”
Student opinion on the
portal to hell was divided:
“I think it is an exciting ad-
dition to the campus,” said
Tom Smith, a second-year
biologist, “people always
say that Imperial students
never really care about
anything, so it’s good to
have something that gets
them talking.” Caroline
Lombard, a final year
chemical engineer, was
less impressed: “I just
think it’s really unfair
of them to open the
hell-portal now. I’ve got
exams coming up, and a
really important course-
work deadline, as well as
interviews at KPMG next
week. How am I supposed
to get any work done
when demonic voices
keep screaming I’m going
to burn in eternal torment?
Hangman’s impression of the portal // Imperial College
I got enough of that at
Sunday school”
One student entered
the portal on Wednesday
night, after losing an
odds-on at Sports Night,
and was found wandering
around the Huxley Build-
ing naked early Thursday
morning. Speaking to
Hangman, he described
his experience: “I didn’t
think anything would
happen, but I suddenly
found myself transported
to an intense inferno.
There were hundreds
upon hundreds of people,
all packed together, twist-
ing in eternal torment. I
initially thought I was in
Metric, but the music was
much better. I don’t really
know how I made it out.”
Levels 4 and 5 remain
open.
“One student
told Hangman
‘I’ve got
exams, but
how am I
supposed to
focus with
demons
screaming at
me?’”

HANGMAN
Oscar Scrimmens
feels the current
debate on access to
higher education is a
personal attack on his
background.

A
student at Im-
perial who at-
tended public
school has told
Hangman that he “really
deserves to be here”,
and “actually worked,
like, super hard.”
Oscar Scrimmens, a
third-year medical student
who attended Harrow
School before coming
to Imperial, made these
comments to Hangman
following the release of
data showing that the
College has reduced its
uptake of state school
pupils. Scrimmens said
that the growing debate
over privilege in higher
education felt like a “per-
sonal attack” on his right
to study at Imperial.
“I just think that a lot
of people are now looking
at me, and thinking ‘does
he really deserve to be
here, or did he just swan
his way in’, and it’s super
unfair,” Scrimmens told
Hangman. “I actually put
in so much time and effort
to get where I am today
– just as much hard work
as someone who went
to state school. I would
spend hours with my tutor
each evening, going over
interview prep and foster-
ing a sense of entitlement
and overblown confidence
– I really put in hard work,
and to hear people say I’m
only where I am because
I’m rich is really hurtful.”
When asked whether
he thought there was a
problem with inequality at
Imperial, Scrimmens told
Hangman: “obviously I
think that we should have
a more equal society, and
I’m willing to go along
with that, provided I don’t
have to examine or inter-
rogate my own practices,
habits, or worldview.”
The comments come
amid an increasing focus
on widening access to
university. Earlier this
week a group of students
assembled on Queen’s
Lawn in protest of the
findings that Imperial is
the most unequal universi-
ty in terms of admissions,
carrying signs saying “eat
the rich”, “get the poshos
out”, and – for some
reason – “bring back SCR
breakfasts”.
Scrimmens’ comments
had a mixed reaction
among fellow students: “I
don’t think he shouldn’t
be here because he’s
posh,” one coursemate
told Hangman, “I think he
shouldn’t be here because
he’s a fucking twat.”
Maybe if we don’t talk about inequality, it will go away?

This week you’re
assembling your
Valentine’s Day playlist.
So far it’s mainly Sufjan
Stevens played loud
enough to drown out the
sound of you crying into
your pillow.
This week you download
a food waste app, and
manage to score 34 boxes
of out of date mince pies.
Christmas never ends.
This week your hair dryer
gives up the ghost. On the
bright side, your boiler
has also broken, so you
won’t be showering for a
while anyway.
This week you’re looking
forward to spending this
Valentine’s Day at home,
with your 23 cats.
This week you plan to
pop the question to your
girlfriend of four years on
Valentine’s Day. Then she
orders straight fries in the
Union. You call it off.
This week you decide
to boycott Valentine’s
Day, which is a sickening
example of capitalist
exploitation and greedy
monetisation of emotions.
Then you get a tinder
match and simmer down.
This week you’re a
sabbatical officer, and
you’re desperately
trying to think of what
manifesto promises you
can claim to have fulfilled
before you finish your
time in office.
This week you try and
introduce some variation
into your love-life in
anticipation of Valentine’s
Day. You use your left
hand.
This week you decide
to keep ordering coffees
until that cute barista
at the SCR cafe notices
you. You get taken to
ChelWest A&E with
severe palpitations.
This week you’re
debating whether or not
to run in the big elections,
but are worried it might
reveal your fundamental
unlikability.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer,
and you wonder how
many of these need to
be about dying alone
before someone stages an
intervention.
