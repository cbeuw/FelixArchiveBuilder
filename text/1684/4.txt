The report cites
particular concerns
over communication,

mperial College
Union (ICU) have
written up an eval-
uation of the first
term of the newly-im-
plemented Wellbeing
Representation Network
(WBRN), which high-
lighted issues with com-
munication, develop-
ment, and consultation.
The document, which
was presented to ICU’s
Trustee Board, centres
around the development
of the WBRN – a network
of departmental and year
representatives, respon-
sible for listening to
concerns students might
have about their wellbe-
ing, and pointing them to
relevant support services.
The positions within the
WBRN, which was rolled
out for the first time this
year, were elected in this
Cashless trial extended to end of February
lets has been extended
for a second time, until
the end of February.
The trial, which origi-
nally began at the begin-
ning of December across
four outlets, was con-
tinued through January,
when it was expanded
to eight outlets. The trial
will now run until the
end of February in outlets
including the SCR Res-
taurant, Queen’s Tower
Rooms, and the College
Café, among others.
While the pilot is in
place, students, staff, and
visitors will be unable to
pay with cash, but will
be able to pay with Yoyo,
contactless, and chip and
pin. The College’s jus-
tification for the change
is to “reduce queuing
times and create a faster
service”, citing feedback
they had received on these
issues. They claim that,
on average, over 80% of
transactions are already
cashless.
Since the start of the
trial, a number of students
and staff have spoken to
Felix in criticism of the
changes.Onepostgraduate
student told Felix she had
stopped going to College
outlets, but recognised
this was not possible for
all students. Theodor
Videnberg, a postgraduate
student, cited a number of
concerns over the move
to cashless transactions:
“Cash is a valid and
legal tender, and I see no
reason to prohibit it at the
College. The College has
not provided any statisti-
cal or scientific evaluation
of the reason for the long
queuing times they cite.
They have not shown
they are due to the paying
procedure itself, rather
than more fundamental
issues [with the catering
systems]”
Students and staff are
able to leave feedback
on the trial through an
online form. The College
say that they will be “as-
sessing [the trial’s] overall
impact…and will publish
this evaluation here online
in March.”
year’s Autumn Elections.
The report highlighted
problems with the time-
scale of the rollout, which
“put constraints on the
ability to conduct effective
and meaningful consul-
tation”. The launch-date
of Autumn meant there
was “not sufficient time
to consult with College
staff”, who had expressed
concern over a lack of
trialling. This lack of time
was compounded by “a
lack of staff leadership
and clear objectives…
until June 2017.”
the implementation of
the WBRN, specifically
around student safety,
communication, and the
speed at which the imple-
mentation was being done.
The report admits “if
departments had been met
earlier in planning more
could have been done to
address points raised”,
and says the students who
“opposed the implemen-
tation of the Network met
with departments before
the Union, which led to
biases and uncertainty…
and discredited the work
that had been completed.”
Consultation with
students was also an issue
identified by the evalua-
tion, which described the
communication with stu-
dents as “insufficient” and
having “no reach beyond
existing elected volun-
teers”. The authors said
this poor communication
led to “limited widespread
understanding of the
Network, which continues
to be a challenge for vol-
unteers”.
Fintan O’Connor,
Deputy President
(Welfare), told Felix: “The
new WBRN has been
recognised as a success by
elected representatives,
College staff, and our
memberssinceitslaunch.”
He said the Network “has
directly led to a surge
of new campaigns and
community-building
projects across the whole
undergraduate student
body,” which has “helped
us lay the groundwork
for a campaign to lobby
College to create a mean-
ingful and radical student
wellbeing strategy.”
Felix: “This report echoes
concerns the RCSU has
been raising for months.
I am glad these short-
comings in implementing
the WBRN so rapidly
have been accepted, and
I hope now we will get
some more constructive
input on the future of the
Network. I look forward
to…ensuring the WBRN
can overcome these chal-
lenges and deliver for all
students.”
O’Connor told Felix the
Union were “committed
to completing a term one
evaluation that would take
a critical look back at how
the WBRN was consulted
upon and implemented”,
and the report would “tell
an honest picture of how
we can perform better
in future.” He told Felix
“These evaluations are
intended to help us under-
stand what can be done
better… meaning taken on
their own they can paint a
negative picture”
Nevertheless, the report
does highlight a number
of successes of the
WBRN, including “a high
percentage of positions
filled”, “creation of tangi-
ble change” as a result of
staff-student committees,
building of “relationships
with key staff across all
departments”. It also
makes a number of rec-
ommendations for moving
the WBRN forward into
the next academic year.
O’Connor told Felix: “We
believe the success of the
WBRN speaks for itself,
and that’s backed up by
the views of the partici-
pants.”
One participant in
the WBRN told Felix:
“my main issue with the
Network was it was trying
to address an issue without
a mission statement of
how to do so. So many
students dealing with sen-
sitive issues were unsure
of their roles, meaning the
Network is hard to handle
logistically. Ultimately
while the wellbeing of
students is something we
can campaign about, the
main issue is a poorly
equipped counselling
service. A network of stu-
dents feeding into this al-
ready-overloaded service
is not going to solve this.”
Nominations in the
Leadership Election
for positions within the
Network are now open.

The southern site of
Imperial's White City
campus will feature
retail space, a hotel,
and up to 370 homes.

mperial College
London last week
revealed their
masterplan for the
southern section of their
new campus in White
City.
The site, which is
located south of the
Westway, next to Wood
Lane and the White City
underground station,
is the second aspect of
Imperial White City –
the new campus, which
covers a 23-acre site. The
cost of the development is
expected to total between
£2 to £3 billion.
The masterplan, which
has been submitted to the
A
cademics at
U n i v e r s i t y
C o l l e g e
London this
week backed a motion
of no confidence in the
university’s leadership,
amid concerns over
plans for expansion.
On Wednesday
evening, at a meeting of
UCL staff have no confidence in expansion plans
academics, 94% voted
they had no confidence in
UCL’s governance, which
has been pushing aggres-
sive expansion over the
past few years.
The meeting came just
days after one of the UK’s
most senior judges asked
for an investigation into
the alleged managerial
misconduct. Terence
Etherton, the master
of the rolls, has asked
barrister Charles Bourne
to look into complaints
that members of UCL’s
ruling council have been
excluded from decisions
over the expansion. In a
letter, Sir Terence said that
Professor Michael Arthur,
UCL’s provost, and Dame
DeAnne Julius, chair of
the ruling council, were
“intent on driving through
a programme of rapid ex-
pansion of UCL, exposing
necessary due to financial
concerns. It was reported
that plans may be under-
way to increase the size
to 60,000 students in the
near future, as universities
struggle to keep up in in-
creasingly-global league
tables.
Rex Knight, UCL’s
vice-provost for opera-
tions, told the meeting
that dropping student
numbers to 20 or 30,000
would have “pretty ap-
palling” consequences for
the university.
A key aspect of this
expansion is the develop-
ment of a new campus in
east London, located on
the Olympic Park. ‘UCL
East’, which will cover
4.63 hectares, is due to
complete its first phase
by 2021, and will provide
resources for 4,000 stu-
dents. The total cost of
the project is expected to
reach £483 million.
93 days. Last year The
Guardian revealed that
morale among UCL staff
was at “an all-time low”,
with nearly 70% of staff
surveyed feeling it was
not well-managed. Less
than 10% of staff felt that
the increase in student
numbers would improve
UCL.
UCL, a member of the
Russell Group, is regu-
larly ranked among the
top higher education in-
stitutions in the world. In
this year’s Times Higher
Education rankings they
placed 16th
, down from
14th
two years ago. Many
see the move to expand
as indicative of increased
pressures being placed on
higher education institu-
tions.
London Borough of Ham-
mersmith and Fulham
(LBHF), comes following
a year-long consultation
with businesses and local
residents.
The southern site will
include a number of new
features, including a hotel,
retail space, and new
houses. It will also feature
connections between the
two sides of the campus,
including a new land
bridge over the Central
Line railway tracks.
Up to 370 homes will
be built on the site, in two
buildings of 17 and 32
stories, the latter of which
already has planning per-
mission. A portion of the
houses will be provided
at below-market rates to
Imperial key workers,
who include early career
researchers and Imperial
NHS staff.
There are also plans
to build a 9,000m2
hotel,
with up to 150 bedrooms,
and provide 13,500m2
of
space for retail, leisure,
and food and drink outlets.
The majority of the
space will be used for
research and business
space: 178,000m2
will be
dedicated to both College
research projects, and
businesses who “help
translate this work into
commercial applications
which benefit society”.
Professor Neil Alford,
Associate Provost (Ac-
ademic Planning), said
the campus was “an
exciting new chapter in
the College’s history”.
He said the masterplan
“represents a long term
commitment to the White
City community.”
Imperial College first
bought land in White City
in 2009, and the north-
ern site has been under
construction since 2012.
The Molecular Sciences
Research Hub, which is
due to open in 2018, will
provide the new home for
the Department of Chem-
istry.
Chemistry students are
due to make the move
over the coming year. One
chemistry undergraduate
who spoke to Felix said:
“the new equipment and
buildings might be nice,
but it’s so far away, which
is inconvenient, not only
for travel and associated
costs, but because I won’t
beabletogetbacktowhere
everyone else is based.
Research placements this
summer are also affected,
since the research groups
don’t have time given the
move.”
Concerns have previ-
ously been raised by a
number of local residents,
centring around the 35-
storey tower which dom-
inates the north portion of
the site. The St. Helen’s
Residents’ Association in
North Kensington have
accused the College of
acting like an “aggressive
property developer when
it comes to the planning
and design of its build-
ings, and their impacts on
their neighbours.”
