OTs, what's good?
A
nother week,
another ed-
itorial. But
what made
this week a bit different
was the return of one of
my favourite parts of this
time of year: daffodils.
When I was passing a
petrol station on the way
home last week, I noticed
bunches upon bunches of
daffodils, their flowers
pressed tightly closed
against the roar of traffic,
standing upright in a
bucket, like regimented
soldiers. I bought a bunch,
which have been slowly
blooming on my desk as I
type up articles.
I don’t know why I like
daffodils so much, but it
might be because they are
reassuring. We know they
are coming, every single
year – and yet, when they
do finally appear, they
still seem to be something
of a surprise. This is my
sixth year at Imperial, so
student elections have
become a bit like these
daffodils too – regular
and expected, although
not as pretty. This is the
first year where I’ve really
been involved with the
elections, though, or with
the Union as a whole.
While I’ve been involved
with Felix since coming to
Imperial, it’s never been
with an eye to checking
out what’s going on at the
Union, or seeing what the
College has invested.
This year has provided
something of a rude intro-
duction, therefore, into the
world of Union hackery.
While I can’t say I’ve not
enjoyed having a peek
inside the inner workings
of Imperial, I think a year
will be enough for me –
don’t worry, you’ll only
have to put up with these
for a few more months.
This issue we’re looking
at something that I’ve
been thinking about since
I ran for the role: how we
hold our elected officials
accountable. Each year
we elect a set of officer
trustees, who all run on
manifesto promises; and
each year they end their
term with a list of things
they have achieved,
which – though admirable
– is often different to what
they set out to do.
While they’ve still got
quite a bit of time left to
do things, we thought
this week would be a
good time to check in
with what they’ve been
up to, perhaps giving
potential candidates an
idea of the kind of things
Officer Trustees might
do on a day to day basis.
We’ll be doing another
one at the end of the year,
when time’s really up, to
see what’s fallen by the
wayside. So give it a read,
and see what you think.
Or don’t! Skip through
to the Arts section and
check out the latest
reviews; or head over to
Sport, which earned our
Editor Imraj the MVP
award for biggest section
this week; or just skip
straight to Puzzles, and
give the crossword a go
over your morning crois-
sant. I won’t blame you.
As I said, Union hackery
isn’t for everyone.
When I first started
this role, I was expecting
the most exciting and re-
warding aspects of the job
would be holding people
to account, and reporting
on the news that really
matters to you. While
that’s still hugely impor-
tant to me, what I’ve come
to realise is the part of the
job I find so incredible
is getting to work with
the group of wonderful
individuals who make up
the Felix team. Each week
I am bowled over by their
efforts, and I hope you
are too. Beauty and joy
can crop up in the least
expected of places – like
those rows of daffodils on
a gas station forecourt.

Dataontheadmission
cycle has revealed
only 63.5% of the
2016/17 entrants were
from state school,
placing Imperial only
above Oxbridge and
Durham.

N
ew data show
Imperial is
among the
w o r s t - p e r -
forming universities in
the UK in terms of ad-
mission of state school
applicants.
Data released by the
Higher Education Statis-
tics Agency (HESA), the
official agency for collec-
tion of quantitative infor-
mation about higher edu-
cation in the UK, showed
that out of the 2016/17
admissions, 63.5% were
from state school. This
places Imperial as 4th
lowest out of the Russell
Group for admitting state
school applicants: only
Oxford, Cambridge, and
Durham admitted a lower
percentage of state school
Portrait of Professor Tom Kibble unveiled
Professor of Theoretical
Physics at Imperial
College London, was
unveiled earlier this
week.
The portrait, which was
painted by Tess Barnes,
was revealed by Professor
Kibble’s three children, in
a ceremony on Monday.
Professor Peter Higgs,
who had worked in similar
research areas to Profes-
sor Kibble, was scheduled
to attend, but was unable
due to illness.
The unveiling was
preceded by two short lec-
tures by Professor Kellog
Stelle and Professor
Anne-Christine Davis.
Professor James Stir-
ling, Provost of Imperial,
said he was “one of the
hundreds of thousands of
young scientists that Tom
inspired”, and that it had
been “a real privilege…to
get to know him” before
his death in 2016, at the
age of 83.
Professor Kibble,
who was born in 1932 in
Madras, India, came to
Imperial in 1959, after
completing a PhD in
mathematical physics at
the University of Edin-
burgh.
He joined the Theoreti-
cal Physics Group, which
was a recent development
at Imperial
In the 1960s, Professor
Kibble’s work with Gerald
Guralnik and C. R. Hagen
led to the co-discovery
of the Higgs mechanism
and the Higgs boson, for
which he was awarded the
2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize
for Theoretical Particle
Physics.
He was notably absent
from the 2013 Nobel
Prize in Physics, which
was awarded to Françcois
Englert and Peter Higgs
for their “theoretical
discovery of [the Higgs
mechanism]” – Higgs
later expressed his disap-
pointment that Professor
Kibble did not share the
award.
The portrait is sched-
uled to go on display in
the Blackett Laboratory
soon.
applicants.
These results show a
slight drop in admissions
from state school over
the last couple of years:
in the 2015/16 cycle,
65.5% of entrants were
from state schools, while
in 2014/15 64.8% of
entrants were from state
schools. Imperial’s results
are a significantly lower
than the location-adjusted
benchmark of 71%. These
data cover only UK dom-
iciled students, and there-
fore do not include EU or
international students.
in England in terms of
socioeconomic status. An
analysis of the data found
that those from the most
well-off backgrounds
were eleven times more
likely to be admitted to
Imperial than those from
the most deprived areas.
Ansh Bhatnagar,
Undergraduate Ordinary
Member of Council for
the Faculty of Natural
Sciences, told Felix:
“Once again, we have
more data showing that
Imperial has problems
with socio-economic
inequality. College needs
to have a hard look at its
admissions process which
seems to be promoting
this disparity, and the
Union needs a dedicated
representative for eco-
nomically disadvantaged
students who are already
at this university.”
Over the last two
decades, the percentage
of university students
coming from state schools
has steadily increased:
this year 90% of entrants
in the UK were from state
schools, up from 85% at
the turn of the millennium.
Inastatement,aCollege
representative told Felix:
“We firmly believe an
Imperial education should
be open to the best and
brightest students, what-
ever their background.
We work with schools,
colleges, and community
organisations to inspire,
raise aspirations, stimulate
interest in STEM subjects,
and support attainment”
“Examples of activities
include our STEM Poten-
tial programme, aimed at
high-achieving students
from backgrounds under-
represented in higher edu-
cation – offering lectures,
workshops, and a summer
school”
“We offer the most
generous bursary scheme
of its kind of any UK uni-
versity, as well as a wide
range of scholarships.
However, we know that
there is more we can do,
and we are working to
review our outreach strat-
egy to understand how we
can improve.”
Speaking at the World
Economic Forum last
month, Professor Alice
Gast, President of Impe-
rial, said “While we strive
to be elite universities
without being elitist, we
fail to connect with many
in society”, and high-
lighted the importance
of “develop[ing] new
ways of collaborating and
engaging with [underrep-
resented] communities.”
The findings come two weeks after Imperial was revealed as the most unequal university in England // CC
