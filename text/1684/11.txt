The Audio Focus: An introduction to over-ear IEMs

f you frequently turn
up the volume on
your earbuds to over-
come external noise,
you are at a high risk of
noise induced hearing loss
over time. The average
hearing threshold for a
young adult lies between
18 to 20 kHz, but can fall
to as low as 15 to 16 kHz
due to long exposure to
sound above 85 decibels.
At full volume, a typical
earphone can reach above
100 decibels, able to cause
long-term damage to the
ear after exposures of just
15 minutes.
Over-ear IEMs (in ear
monitors) differ from
your “regular” earphones
by being worn with the
cable going over around
the back of the ear and
inserted deeper into the
ear compared to earpods
or regular earphones,
which sit at the opening of
the ear canal. This comes
with several benefits:
Depending on the tip,
a well fitting over-ear
IEM can reach between
30-40 decibels of noise
isolation, reducing the
noise of a car going at
50 mph (~ 70 dB) to the
ambient noise of an empty
room (~ 40dB). While
ANC (active noise-can-
celling) headphones can
also achieve this, they are
bulkier, require charging,
and work best with
“white” noise; constant
noise such as the sound
of a plane engine. They
are much less effective
against sudden changes,
such as loud conver-
sations, whereas IEMs
reduce all noise equally
by physically blocking
your ear canal.
Due to the noise
isolation, IEMs allow
you to listen to music at
lower volumes, thereby
reducing the risk of ear
damage. Volumes at 70
decibels and below are
rated safe for constant
exposure, but as typical
advice, it is recommended
that you turn down the
volume as low as possible
while still being able to
be noticeable in critical
listening, this difference
is extremely obvious
in certain songs (for
example Lorde “Royals”
and Hans Zimmer “Why
so serious?”).
Many new models
comewithmodularcables,
allowing a replacement if
they are damaged. They
can also be attached to a
bluetooth module to turn
them into wireless IEMs.
However with all their
benefits, over-ear IEMs
also come with certain
drawbacks:
Getting a proper fit can
be difficult and time-con-
suming, but usually it is
easy to tell when you have
achieved it, as the amount
of noise isolation and
sound clarity jumps to a
new level. To achieve this,
different tips may have to
be tried until the best one
is found. A popular (but
more expensive) option
is using memory foam
tips (In the below picture,
3rd from left), which
compress to fit in the ear
and then expand to fill
the ear canal. These often
come standard with higher
end IEMs. Some IEMs
may also be too physically
large for smaller ears and
this can be difficult to tell
when purchasing online.
A deep fit using triple
flanges (below, 3rd from
right) may be uncomforta-
ble to those with sensitive
ears, and a shallower fit
will provide a smaller
(but still good) amount of
noise isolation.
hear the music.
Reduction of “micro-
phonics”, which are the
vibrations transmitted
through the wire of your
earphones when they are
moved, resulting in those
annoying rustling noises.
By wearing IEMs over
the ear, the vibrations
are dampened by a great
amount.
Improved sound
quality can be achieved
with a proper fit. The
wavelengths of frequen-
cies in the range of 10 to
13 kHz are short enough
that acoustic resonance
can occur between the
earphone output and
eardrum when inserted
insufficiently deep,
causing the symptom
known as “sibilance” (a
harsh spike in volume
at higher frequencies).
In addition, subbass (the
rumble at frequencies
< ~100 Hz) quantity is
greatly improved by a
proper seal. For example,
the apple earpods lose
up to 25 decibels in the
subbass due to their more
open design. Given that a
change in 2-3 decibels can
Personally over the
last 6 months I have been
using the Shure SE846
(RRP: £829) along with
dual-flange silicone tips
(below, 2nd from the left),
resulting in incredible
noise isolation and sound
quality on the go. Without
going too much into the
technical details, the
special feature of these
IEMs is that they have
certain technology which
allows a clearer delivery
of sounds below 90Hz,
resulting in a feeling of
having miniature sub-
woofers inserted into your
ears, in addition to filters
which can vary the sound
by a small amount.
When they are properly
in place:
• The ambient noise
of an empty room sounds
“loud” in comparison
• With music
playing, a busy street is
inaudible, and the under-
ground is barely audible.
Plane noise is virtually
inaudible and only the
vibration can be felt.
• Roads have to
be triple checked before
crossing.
• Annoyed parents
have to be dealt with for
not responding to calls
across the room.
Now, good IEMs don’t
have to cost an arm and
leg, as they can range
from as little as £10 to
as much as £3000. At a
premium cost, you can
also get IEMs that are
custom silicone moulded
to the shape of your ear,
for increased comfort.
However, these require
a visit to the Audiologist
and can take weeks to
make and deliver, and
may not fit anymore
within a few years as the
ears are still growing and
changing in the majority
of young adults.
Several companies in
the past year have been
working on creating 3D
printed custom moulds
out of 3D scans, or even
phone pictures, in order
to speed up the process,
but this is still a relatively
new technology.
If you’ve come this far,
and are willing to give up
a few days worth of coffee
for an improved listening
experience, unfortunately
there are few universal
recommendations. Each
person’s sound and fit
preferences vary. It can
be worth visiting one of
London’s audio shops
and see what they have in
store to demo.
Otherwise, many new
brands from China have
been offering great value
IEMs for around £10 to
£30, but delivery from
Aliexpress can take a few
weeks. Some are also
available from Amazon at
a markup.
Some choices available
directly from Amazon:
KZ ATE (£13), MEE M6
Pro (£25), Shure SE215
(£90), RHA MA750 (£80),
FiiO FH1 (£80).
