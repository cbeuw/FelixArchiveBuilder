LGBT History Month: Why is it
important?
LGBT History Month gives us a chance to look at how far things have come,
and how far we have left to go.

I
f you’ve wondered
why the Queen’s
Tower is lit up in
rainbow colours, it’s
because Imperial is cur-
rently celebrating LGBT
(Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Transgender) History
Month – an annual ob-
servance of the history
and experiences of LGBT
people that aims to pro-
mote acceptance and raise
awareness of the issues
faced by this community.
This year’s theme is
‘Geography: Mapping
the World’. Looking back
on 2017, the good news
is that ten more coun-
tries legalised same-sex
marriage. However, the
LGBT+ community also
suffered severe attacks
in countless parts of the
world, with an extreme
example being the abduc-
tion and torture of over
100 men, at least three
of whom were killed, in
the Chechen Republic
of Russia on the basis of
their perceived sexual
orientation. This was not
an isolated incident, as
discrimination against
LGBT+ people is insti-
tutionalised in Russia
– activists’ requests to
hold rallies are frequently
rejected by officials and
when these events occur
it is not uncommon for
participants to be targeted
by homophobic attacks.
In October, Human
Rights Watch reported the
arrest and torture of gay
andbisexualmenbypolice
in Azerbaijan. Similar
institutional crackdowns
occurred in Indonesia
and Egypt only last year.
Furthermore, the wide-
spread misunderstanding
of transgender people, and
the lack of recognition of
the separation of gender
identity and sexual orien-
tation, imply that the trans
community is also very
likely to be persecuted or
otherwise abused under
such anti-gay laws.
Nonetheless, it must be
the LGBT+ community,
but to attain fundamental
human rights.
Since the decriminali-
sation of homosexuality
in 1967, the UK has im-
plemented further laws to
advance LGBT+ rights,
including protection
against discrimination in
employment, allowing
transgender people to
change their name and
legal gender, and the
legalisation of same-sex
marriage. However, im-
provements still need to
be made. For example, the
UK’s Gender Recognition
Act still involves a highly
medicalised process and
does not recognise non-bi-
nary people. Moreover,
trans youth are extremely
under-represented in
society and are frequently
attacked in the media to
the point that almost half
of trans pupils in the UK
have attempted suicide.
In fact, schools are still
not safe spaces for trans
and LGB people, and
current sex education is
not inclusive of LGBT+
issues. According to
recent data from Stone-
wall, many LGBT+
people face significant
challenges in all areas,
with 45% of LGBT+
students facing bullying
for their sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity
and 25% of transgender
people feeling obliged to
switch jobs as a result of
harassment and bullying.
There is no place in the
world where full equality
has been reached. It is
an ongoing battle where
rollbacks often happen.
This is why it is so
important to acknowledge
the contributions LGBT+
people have made to
society in the face of
systemic oppression and
to honour those who have
committed their lives to
securing a better future for
the LGBT+ community.
Here’s what I’m up
to at the moment!
A
s part of LGBT History Month,
IQ (Imperial College LGBT+) and
I are running a series of events
throughout February.
This weekend you can join IQ at the
National Student Pride, one of the biggest
student events of the year, featuring
Courtney Act.
If you would like to learn more about LGBT
history, Lola Phoenix is coming to Imperial
on the 13th
for their talk on the Stonewall
Riots, Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and
more. IQ will provide snacks, and there will
be an opportunity for a Q&A at the end!
Also, don’t miss out on the very first LGBT+
careers fair at Imperial on the 22nd
.
Have a look at imperialcollegeunion.
org/lgbthm for upcoming events later this
month.
In the last few months, through
consultations with students and staff from
different departments, I have identified
several things College should be pushed to
implement to improve the LGBT+ student
experience. Besides more gender-neutral
facilities – which is an issue I have been
working on this year and that is currently
being considered by College – these include
specialised wellbeing and careers support
for LGBT+ students and the use of inclusive
language in lectures, resources, and
communications. A major long-term goal
is trans-inclusive training for senior tutors
and key members of staff. Considerable
steps in the right direction were made this
year with the drafting of a College policy
aimed at supporting trans students. Trans-
inclusive training is something I am raising
with College senior members of staff at
the moment, but that will probably require
further lobbying efforts in the next years.

“There is no

recognised that LGBT+
people worldwide face
extreme daily oppression
that goes unreported. This
is reflected by the fact that
engaging in same-sex re-
lations remains criminal-
ised in 72 countries, and
is punishable by death in
at least four of these. Most
countries do not allow
trans people to change
their name and gender
from those assigned at
birth and only a few rec-
ognise non-binary people.
It is estimated that a
quarter of the world’s
population believes that
being LGBT should be a
crime.
In light of this, it is
evident that there is still
an enormous amount of
work left to do, not only
to achieve equality for
