IC Squash finishes 5th
in the country
T
he men’s 1st
team finished
their BUCS
season 5th over-
all after beating Oxford,
Newcastle and Sheffield
at the weekend. The team
travelled to Birmingham
to compete in the BUCS
Premier stage which took
place on the 27th and 28th
January. The rewards for
a season’s worth of tough
training sessions were
convincing wins against
Oxford (5-0), Sheffield
(4-1) and Newcastle (3-2).
Imperial lost to Oxford
(2:3) back in November,
while IC was playing
without their strongest
squad. For the season’s
deciding weekend,
Japan’s Seigo Masuda
(World Ranking 315) was
able to join the team and
bring with him a wealth
of experience at the top of
next season in less chal-
lenging circumstances.
The match against
Newcastle was the high-
light of the weekend, with
IC Squash managing to
come back from several
matchballs down to pull
off a tightly contested 3-2
win, despite Newcastle
claiming more games
overall. Marco Alves,
who represented his
native Portugal at junior
level, soaked up intense
pressure from his spirited
opponent, who managed
to draw level from two
games down. Marco
then showed his mental
strength and technical
quality in the decider to
clinch victory in what was
to be the deciding string.
Men’s 1st team captain
Puvendren Subramaniam
said: “It was a great
weekend and it’s nice
to finish the season on a
positive note. We need
all the available support
from Sport Imperial, if
we want to compete at the
highest levels of squash
in the BUCS setup”.
The University of Bir-
mingham, UWE and the
University of Nottingham
played for the title of
best squash team in the
UK, with UWE claiming
the top spot. IC Squash
will be competing in the
prestigious Roehampton
Cup over the weekend of
the 3rd and 4th February
and is looking forward to
its first inaugural Doubles
Tournament at Ethos
on the 10th and 11th
February.

Futsal – a lesser known IC success story
W
e headed
into this
c r u c i a l
m a t c h
against London Met
knowing that we would
likely have to win both
of our remaining games
to finish top and gain
promotion. There was
excitement from the first
whistle, with captain
Alex tapping the ball in
from Ife’s cutback in the
first opening seconds.
This quick goal was only
bettered by the eleven
seconds it took Christian
Eriksen to score against
United the same evening.
Before London Met
could get into the game,
futsal stalwarts Barry
Allen (fastest man alive)
and Ife had both added a
goal each to their tallies
in the race to become our
top scorer. Daniele de
Rossi-wannabe Tommaso
and vice-captain Josh
Mendes both fired in
from distance, and Alan
finished off after a neat
1-2 with Alex, who got his
second goal by lashing in
a rebound. Pleasingly, in
this match we addressed
our ongoing problem of
not taking our first-half
chances, leading 7-2 at the
break (iz great success).
We were not playing the
expansive, rapid passing
game (for comparison see
Barcelona 2010-11) that
had been so effective in
previous matches, because
we simply did not need
to. Klopp would have
loved our gegenpressing,
Our magnificent keeper
Alejandro (please don’t
leave us x), a futsal nat-
ural, was being worked
hard as they pulled it back
to 8-6, at which point
we woke up again. Josh
completed his hat-trick,
and Will justified all the
time spent trying flicks
in training by finally
scoring one in a match.
Ed and Keidi got stuck
into tackles and kept them
at bay for the rest of the
contest. For Ed’s excel-
lent defence he was award
man of the match along
with Josh whose hat-trick
secured the game. The
deserved victory puts
us on five wins from six
league matches, and we
now await our final match
against Queen Mary’s.
By the time that comes
around, it is likely to be a
head-to-head title decider.

it has been characteristic
of our performances this
season to grow stronger

this game we lowered
our intensity and lost
