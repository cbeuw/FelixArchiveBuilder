Why going cashless has a bigger impact than
you might think
The College seems to be rolling out cashless-only payment, but the transition to a cashless
campus has impacts on liberty, choice, and convenience.

n December 2017,
several catering
outlets at Imperial
College (e.g. SCR,
H-Bar, Business School
Café, etc.) started a
cashless pilot. Initially
intended to last until the
end of January 2018, it
has since been extended
to the end of February.
During the trial period
the involved catering
outlets do not accept
cash payments, but only
payments by credit cards,
debit cards, and Yoyo.
The College says that the
cashless trial is intended
to reduce queuing times.
If this trial is not opposed
by significant numbers of
people, it is highly prob-
able that the College will
infinitely extend the trial
and thus permanently ban
cash from its premises.
An avid and passionate
cash payer myself, I vehe-
mently oppose any means
to impair my freedom
of choice. That goes for
standard things like pro-
fession, hobbies, friends
etc., but also extends to the
method of payment. Cash
is a valid and legal tender,
and I see no reason to
prohibit it at the College.
Every year, many people
from outside Imperial –
contractors, visitors, and
freshly-started students
and staff – attend the
college and might not yet
have a bank account or
credit card (for whatever
reason). They would be
denied the opportunity to
buy a coffee or snack.
On a bigger-than-Col-
lege perspective, I believe
that – amidst global finan-
cial upheaval, banking
crises, and rising debt –
the removal of cash would
further virtualize money,
and could lead to unpre-
dictable consequences and
bubbles. Bitcoin seems to
be a precursor.
desbank is that cash is still
required, and the freedom
of choice for users should
be upheld. The World
Economic Forum also
agrees that cash is a direct
link between people
and central banks and
serves to establish trust
and public acceptance of
central banks.
Other problematic
issues of cashless soci-
eties are employment
opportunities. A recent
report by PWC examines
the likelihood of job
losses due to automation.
It shows that disciplines
like retail, food service,
and manufacturing are es-
pecially endangered. It is
highly likely that – amidst
a move toward cashless
Imperial – several cashiers
and other catering staff
might be laid off. While
there is not enough space
to cover all the problems
with going cashless – and
I could go on forever –
there are other issues,
think it is very disappoint-
ing to see that a College
which prides itself on
diversity and freedom,
and celebrates events such
as LGBT History Month,
is willing to take away the
fundamental freedom of
payment choice.
I hope that I made my
arguments clear, and that
students – irrespective
whether they prefer cash
or cashless payments –
will join me in opposing
the ban on cash payments.
As a cashless payer, it
might not be directly
relevant to you, but the
implications are bigger
than you might think.

evaluation of the reason
for the long queuing
times. They also have not
shown that the reason is
the payment procedure
itself, rather than more
fundamental issues like
too many customers
arriving at the same time
or time lost due to having
to wait for a certain dish.
It is also unlikely that
there will be any signifi-
cant improvements of the
queuing times by squeez-
ing out the remaining
20% of cash customers,
with College claiming
that 80% of payments
are already cashless. It is
difficult to comment on
the College’s arguments,
since they have provided
virtually none, other than
a claim that some people
have complained about
queuing times.

The West’s thirst for these sweet, buttery fruits should be contrasted with the potential

T
his week I was
supposed to
talk about the
Imperial College
Endowment Fund. But
given the post mortem
has been carried out and
Imperial students have got
back to thinking about the
science stuff, I thought
I’d write about drugs and
avocadoes.
Let’s start with the
latter. They’re green,
they’re clean and a fruit,
not a vegetable. They
also contain approxi-
mately four grams of
protein and have helped
facilitate surging trends
in veganism, ‘raw’ eating
and all round healthiness.
Some talk so highly about
them you would think they
are the underlying cause
of this generational shift,
such are their properties.
In the UK alone avocado
sales increased by £29.8m
from 2016 to 2017 and in
2015 the US consumed
4 billion of the damn
things. The Hass Avocado
Board (real thing)
recorded 92,535,729 kg
of avocados produced
worldwide in 2018 so far,
this being estimated to hit
405,195,664 kg by July.
In short, our increased
demand for them in the
West has seen prices soar
and the profits roll in. So
far, so good for consumers
and exporters alike.
One such exporter,
Mexico, produces 45% of
the world’s green gold. It
is also a country plagued
by drug cartels. For all
the millions and millions
that have been invested in
the war against drugs, or-
ganised crime still seems
to hold Mexico in a state
of terror. In fact, last year
was the country’s most
violent on record as hom-
icides totalled 29,168. Of
course not all these deaths
can be attributed to the
cartels, but an alarming
proportion are.
What’s the link
between avocados and
cartels? Well, that’s
simple. Whenever hard-
working people are evi-
dently prospering, there’s
always a parasite wanting
their slice of the action.
Michoacán, a province
known to be the avocado
capital of Mexico, is the
prime example, having
previously been burdened
by the parasitic tendencies
of cartels. On noticing
farmers’ lucrative activ-
ities, cartels would force
payments upon the crop’s
production, taking their
cut as a sort of protection
money. If payments failed
to be met, threats, kidnap
and murder would follow.
Thus a tense, fractured
atmosphere pervades in
many parts of Michoacán,
and all to keep the shelves
of our supermarkets suffi-
ciently stocked.
On a broader spectrum,
it does seem to be a recur-
ring pattern that whenever
a new superfood, new fad
or even new must-have
pet emerges, with the huge
economic prospects come
unforeseen problems. Un-
foreseen because demand
becomes so intense so
fast that the whole nature
of the suppliers’ original
business has to aggres-
sively evolve or itself be
hijacked. In Peru there
were rumblings that the
popularity of quinoa in
wealthy countries may
be outpricing Andeans,
for whom it has been a
Oprah says it’s good on
a Monday, there’s world
consensus by Tuesday
morning. And so my
point is this: there’s
no time to think of the
consequences. Suppliers
know that demand must
be met immediately,
money needs to be made
and the opportunity taken
before our goldfish brains
turn to the next exciting
thing. Many suppliers
can, for a time, fare well
by catering to these wants.
But often the pressure
is too instantaneous, too
unsustainable. Authorities
cannot plan for such rapid
rises of industry and are
therefore unprepared for
any unsavoury effects that
can come with the boom.
Hence Mexico, cartels and
the avocado’s potential to
cause violent conflict at
any given moment.
But before you start
worrying that even
avocados do more harm
than good and before you
start contemplating that
anything you like is bound
to be causing destruction
somewhere along the line,
let me offer some hope.
Residents of Tancítaro, a
city in Michoacán, have
taken matters into their
own hands by setting
up self-defence groups
backed by government
forces. They have effec-
tively driven the cartels
out and for the most part
people live in safety, no
thanks to any of us im-
porting countries.
Michoacán therefore
lives to fight another day.
Hipsters up and down the
nation can breathe a sigh
of relief that their avocado
smoothies and face masks
are still bang on the
money.

staple for generations. It’s
known that demand for
‘designer dogs’ – pugs,
dachshunds, French
bulldogs (or whatever
the new look this season
is) – has meant barbaric
industrial-scale puppy
farming. To note a less
extreme example, think of
every time a new incredi-
ble holiday destination is
displayed on Facebook,
encouraging you to tag
your ‘travel buddy’. You
can almost guarantee that
next year, car parks will
be overflowing with min-
ibuses and someone has
probably thought to bring
in a KFC.
Now we have instant
connectivity, a trend can
spread like wild fire.
“Whenever

Moreover, I have
privacy and security
concerns in giving the
government and central
banks complete control
over my financial assets,
a view shared by several
experts. In a cashless
society, a government
can introduce negative
interest rates and thus
force the citizen to spend
more. This is not possible
with cash. Or think about
dictatorial regimes, which
are essentially untoucha-
ble if they have complete
control over financial
assets. According to an
unpublished study of the
European Central Bank
(ECB), about 80% of
point-of-sale transaction
are done with cash. The

central banks like the
