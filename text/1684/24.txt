Cute girls with a twist: Doki Doki Literature Club
F
rom the title and
cute picture alone,
you’re probably
thinking that this
is some anime-styled
dating simulator and are
judging both me, and my
life choices. Let me assure
you, this game is literally
not what you expect; if
you choose to experience
it, you’ll be in for a wild,
freaky and mind-bending
ride.
First, let’s get two
major points down.
First of all, this game is
short, it’ll only take you
around four-five hours to
complete; maybe three
if you’re a fast reader.
Second of all, this game
is absolutely free. Yes,
you read that right. The
producer was well aware
most people like yourself
would probably dismiss a
game that appears cute and
innocent on the surface.
Hence why he made this
free to download from
both steam and the game’s
website. Hopefully these
reasons are enough for
you to at least begrudg-
ingly install the game and
see for yourself what it’s
about.
Once you load up the
game, you’re greeted to a
content warning, advising
you not to play if you’re
below thirteen or are
emotionally sensitive.
Given the home screen
and the charming music,
this seems unusual and
curious. You dismiss it for
the time and start playing.
For the first two hours or
so, the game plays like a
fairly light-hearted and
joyful visual novel. You
join a high school liter-
ature club and yes, you
have the option of ‘dating’
some of the characters.
For what it’s worth, this
part of the game is sweet
F-’ moment, made bril-
liant by the fact that it just
shows up when you’re not
really expecting it.
After this point, the
game shows its true
colours and begins to take
a more dark and trippy
direction. The game does
a great job showcasing its
true nature with features
like visual glitches,
characters acting stranger
and the music becoming
distorted, all of which
put you on the edge. At
one point, you even lose
control of the mouse
and the game forces you
towards a certain option.
Things begin to go more
and more out of control,
literally and figuratively,
with almost psychotropic
plot developments which
both haunt and intrigue
you.
Another noteworthy
thing is the clever way the
game breaks the fourth
wall at times. At various
points, files show up in
your game’s file directory
which reference events
that have happened or
foreshadow developments
to come. At a certain
point, you actually have
to delete a file in order to
progress in the game. The
story also develops in a
way that you’ll need to
reinstall it to play again.
This is a psychologi-
cally thrilling game that
no one was expecting, but
all its players enjoyed. It
might be actual game-
play-lite but that only
makes it more accessible
to people and doesn’t
take away from the ex-
perience in the slightest.
I thoroughly recommend
playing this game, espe-
cially if you like a unique
story; just make sure you
don’t do it on a bad day.

and charmful, making you
let your guard down and
get involved in the story
and atmosphere.
Then, almost out of
the blue, an event takes
place which I guarantee
will shock you. In fact,
it startled everyone who
has played this game. The
game builds up to it really
well, with foreboding
dialogue and a slow drop
in music intensity. It is
honestly a very ‘What the
“This game
is literally
not what you
expect”
