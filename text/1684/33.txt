Tough loss for 1st
XV against Sussex
L
ast Wednesday
saw Imperial 1st
XV take on the
University of
Sussex for the second
time this season. Last
time these teams met
Sussex won comfortably,
so Imperial were keen
for this not to be a repeat.
Immediately, Imperial
imposed themselves on
the game and held most
of the possession in the
first ten minutes. Sussex
were constantly under
pressure. Windy condi-
tions meant kicking for
touch was difficult for us,
and Sussex were able to
counterattack effectively.
They would have scored
a couple of times, had
Josh Pope not been there
to make some try saving
tackles. Not all heroes
wear capes. Eventually,
via some lucky offloads,
Sussex were able to run in
a try down the wing.
Colonel’ Ustaran-Ande-
regg and try-saver Josh
Pope to make some yards.
Mounting pressure and
strong carries from the
likes of Jerome Hallett
and Ali Zaboronsky led to
Sussex giving away pen-
alties on their try line. We
opted for the corner, and
a lineout maul was easily
driven over Sussex’s line
with Toby Simpson at the
back of it. Toby later made
it clear to me in the union
bar that he likes it when I
mention his tries in match
reports. After forcing his
way over the try line, Toby
eloquently placed the ball
down in Sussex’s try area
with the precision of a
surgeon and the elegance
of a ballerina, to earn five
points for his team. Still in
awe of Toby’s try, a lapse
in concentration from
Imperial meant Sussex
were able to score another
try on the stroke of half
time, making the score
9-5 to them.
Imperial were very
busy in defence for the
majority of the second half
and did everything they
could to find a way back
into the game. Sussex
kept possession and did
not let us find a rhythm.
Martin Head, at this point
still undefeated in an arm
wrestle (RIP), consist-
ently knocked Sussex
back in defence and
dragged players down by
their ankles. Toby Daniels
also put in some big hits
and Oli Parker made some
important tackles on his
wing. Unfortunately,
despite fighting until the
very end, Imperial were
unable to hold off Sussex
in attack and conceded
three tries in the second
half. The final score was
36-5. Whilst disappoint-
ing, the score line did
not reflect the true nature
of the match, which was
tightly contested for all
80 minutes, and Imperial
left with their heads held
high. Sylvia is getting
impatient.
ICURFC 2nd
XV smash RUM(S)
L
ast Wednesday
saw the mighty
2nd
XV take on
pesky medics
from UCL (RUMS) at
Fortress Harlington – the
same team that they’d
comfortably beaten 36-7
away just a couple of
weeks previously. With
the classic bitter cold
wind swirling in the
Fortress, the anticipation
of that night’s ACC on
everyone’s minds and
coach LJ with his standard
“win this and go out and
get smashed later” team
talk, the scene was set.
The match started perfect-
ly for IC with some strong
carries across the gain
line sucking in the RUMS
defence and leaving space
out wide for Ifan Dafydd
to go over in the corner
for the first try of the
match. Not long after,
Harold Pinter crossed the
whitewash after hitting
a beautiful line through
the midfield and with the
pace of a back, second
row Gianluigi Tosti also
bagged a meat pie. By
half time, Imperial were
leading 19-0 and just one
more try would secure
them the bonus point.
Early on in the second
half, after some pressure
in the RUMS 22, it looked
like Imperial were about
to get this bonus point
when Jack Fraser threw a
beautifully weighted flat
pass straight into the arms
of a RUMS player who
the IC men though and
the bonus point try was
secured shortly after-
wards. Tries came in thick
and fast in the second half
and at times it felt as if the
RUMS defence was like
Ifan’s hair – non-existent.
Harold Pinter teased the
RUMS defence further as
he ran through the middle
of three players, ball in
one hand, and placed the
ball right underneath the
sticks. The second half
also saw some big re-
placements come on and
make an instant impact.
Andreas Jesperson, who
recently claimed he could
play any position, showed
that he could at least play
on the wing by scoring
a 50m try with his first
touch of the ball. Later on
that evening, he would tell
this tale to a female in the
Union bar and she would
fall in love with him. A
small drop in concentra-
tion in the final minute
of the game meant that
RUMS got their second
and final try in the match
but that did not hamper the
spirits of the IC boys too
much who could already
taste the victorious post-
match port and pints.
Gianluigi Tosti completed
a hat-trick of hat-trick
avoidances whilst Wilbur
Sandoe and Andreas
Jesperson got a meat pie
each too. (Paddy) Jackson
Fraser certainly brought
his kicking boots with him
too, successfully landing
6 of the 8 conversions in
less than ideal kicking
conditions. Coach LJ
awarded two man of the
match performances that
day, one to Rob Lawrence
who proved that turning
up to trainings is actually
pointless and the other to
Ifan Dafydd who proved
that you’re never too old
to play. The final score,
Imperial 52 – 12 RUMS,
meant the team were now
9 points clear on top of
the league and still unde-
feated. Sylvia was sung
yet again.

eSports Varsity tournament sees Imperial dominating
Imperial achieved victory over UCL in a number of games, with an excitable crowd on both sides.
SPORTS
eSports Captains
IC eSports Society
T
he second annual
eSports Varsity
made a trium-
phant return last
week, seeing Imperial
take home the trophy
after seeing off UCL
in a series of matches.
Over the course of nu-
merous matches, across
seven different games,
players from both sides
experienced joy, anguish,
and success, in a gripping
day of gaming.
The day started with a
Bo5 series of Overwatch -
the crowd favourite.
Despite a bit of a shaky
start, a substitution was
made after the first loss
and Imperial came out
with a bang, taking all 3
games with significant
margins. The Overwatch
competitive pool has
grown rapidly over the
year, with four Imperial
teams (of 7-8 players
each) looking to partici-
pate in the coming season
of the National University
eSports League (NUEL).
Part of this increase in
number is due to the
standard of playing
demonstrated at Varsity
by the 1st team, who
are currently comprised
only of players ranked
Master or Grandmaster
(top 3% and 1% of the
game). They train quite
often and rigorously,
and discuss strategies
in detail. Clearly, their
efforts did not go to waste
as they showed UCL who
was boss. The MVP was
Raymond “Lood” Li, the
captain of the team.
In the Starcraft 2
Imperial came into
the League of Legends
matches with a sense
of having something to
prove, after their team was
placed lower than UCL’s
a few months ago in the
NUEL. They seemed
to take UCL’s team by
surprise when they won
the first two games within
an hour – a rather speedy
turn of events considering
matches usually last 40
minute apiece. Imperial
showed a great deal of
coordination and overall
skill, going for a vi-
sion-oriented strategy that
saw them placing more
than double the number
of wards placed by UCL.
The MVP went to Chris
“Carniflexin” Swain for
his stellar performance
across Ryze and Azir.
Chris and his team will
also be participating in a
LoL tournament against
Cambridge this coming
week. As a medic who
transferred from Cam-
bridge to Imperial, it will
be interesting to see how
Chris fares against his
alma mater!
This sense of needing
to prove something
continued in the Counter
Strike: Global Offensive
match, which was played
on the map de_inferno
– the same map where
UCL beat Imperial last
year in a best-of-two
tournament. Only one
match was played this
time, but that was long
enough for Imperial to
stake their claim, playing
a solid terrorist side in the
first half, and facing down
a UCL side reluctant to
be defeated in the second.
Overall the match went to
ICL, with the final score
standing at 16-8.
There was less of a
sense of needing to prove
something in the Rocket
League matches, but nev-
after the first match went
convincingly to UCL.
Two close games ran into
overtime, but the players
were all very friendly,
helped out by a great
shoutcaster highlighting
every “Calculated” shot
and whipping the crowd
into a frenzy.
The matches across the
rest of the day highlighted
some of the skills of
the highest-performing
players at Imperial and
UCL. Both teams had
a top-1000 player in
Europe for their Hearth-
stone matches, which
were carried by UCL
after an unlucky turn of
events. The casters again
managed to get everyone
pumped, and there was a
great energy among the
spectators. This energy
could also be found in the
Super Smash Bros Melee
matches, in which UCL
entered with an advantage,
having had more frequent
practice in tournaments.
After not taking the first
match too seriously,
however, UCL realised
what a threat Imperial
could be, and carried the
next two matches. The
final match delivered a
raucous turn of events,
as Imperial very nearly
made a comeback, taking
none continuous stocks –
not quite enough to win
the match, but more than
enough to leave us on the
edge of our seats.
There was only time to
play one match of DoTA,
but both teams made sure
it was worth watching.
UCL entered the match
with two top 1000 in
Europe players, while
Imperial had one former
top-1000 on their side.
Picking hero, Imperial
managed to hold their
own at the beginning of
the game, but a couple of
bad choices meant things
snowballed, and the
victory went to UCL.
While naturally
highlighting the skills of
players across both sides,
the eSports varsity also
went a long way in show-
casing the importance of
getting in great casters,
and how the audience
members really made the
day one to remember – no
wonder tickets were sold
out! Keep an eye out next
year, when Imperial will
head to UCL for away
matches, and will be keen
to defend their title.
“The day
started with
Overwatch
– a crowd
favourite”
matches Imperial made
short work of UCL,
winning four out of the
five matches, across
games that included all
races. The matches were
casted by IC alumni,
who were able to provide
stellar support from the
sidelines, ensuring a ten-
sion-filled experience for
all those watching.
“There was
one match
of DoTA, but
both teams
made sure
it was worth
watching”
ertheless Imperial domi-
nated in the best-of-five
tournament, winning 3:1
