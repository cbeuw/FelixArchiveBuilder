The lights are on, but nobody’s home
T
he duo consisting
of Mike Milosh
and Robin Braun,
known together
as Rhye, would in 2013
release Woman. Woman
aggressively dealt with
the softer parts of life and
love. Bold in its message,
but delivered with a fragile
gentleness, almost soft to
the touch; Woman did little
to avoid the comparisons
to Sade. Milosh’s ethe-
real, androgynous vocal
melodies paired with lush
production on pieces such
as ‘Open’ and ‘The Fall’
would proceed to create
an internet frenzy, garner-
ing critical acclaim from
most publications.
It wasn’t until early
2017 that Braun would
proceed to leave the
group, leaving Rhye a solo
project with Milosh and a
backing band, centered
around its live perfor-
mances. Blood, under the
command of Milosh, con-
tinues what was started
on Woman. In terms of
musicianship, it’s a direct
step up from the studio
experiment that was their
previous album. Each
note and measure is cal-
culated, crisp and precise.
Played in a mellow and
deliberate manner, every
pulse of music oozes with
sexiness, calming the
nerves with an unforetold
sophistication. The atmos-
phere that is intricately
sculpted, song by song,
is admirable. Despite
this, however, it is soon
evident that the album
is all style, and woefully
little substance.
The Nicolas Winding
Refn of albums, Blood
has oodles of production
and instrumental flourish,
but nothing more concrete
to back it up, rendering it
emasculated and stripped
of identity. Agreeable at
best, the worst parts of
soft pop music come to
light over the course of 42
minutes. Music you could,
without much thought,
nod your head along to
in moments of vacuous
serenity, with little to
no engagement of any
critical faculties. The lack
of emotive and powerful
songs like ‘Open’ from
Rhye’s debut also makes
for a consistently plain,
and disappointingly
inoffensive album. The
only exception to this rule
is track nine, ‘Phoenix’.
Embracing a groove,
Rhye venture out of their
comfort zone, creatively
reworking funk motifs.
Milosh chants, “Oh my
god”, as the bassline takes
on a life of its own.
Though the album
never reaches the
somewhat more lofty
heights of the band’s
debut, it offers a few
decent songs sprinkled
here and there, making
the listening experience at
least marginally pleasant.
Almost ironically, Blood
seems to be trying its
best to emulate Woman,
whereas it undeniably
has the potential to forgo
the clichés of its soft rock
roots and be something
more wild and free.
Something with a mind of
its own. With some sort
of personality. Come on,
Mike. Get it together. We
know you can do better
than that.
Modern Lore is an instant classic
T
hirty years into
his life, twen-
ty-five years into
his guitar-playing
career, and two years into
his time as a bandleader,
Julian Lage has returned
with his most mature
album yet. Playing the
darling Telecaster that
gave Arclight its won-
derful fuzzy feel, and
supported by bassist Scott
Colley and drummer
Kenny Wollesen (legends
in their own right), Lage
flings from fret to fret,
fingers frolicking in the
twilight between full tube
clipping and the classic
clarity of more conven-
tional jazz guitar. Lage
is a wizard of intonation;
his control over the guitar
is tight enough to be
able to seemingly pile
on and back off the fuzz
at a moment’s notice by
subtly switching up his
strumming technique.
The work in the details is
stunning.
And while Lage deftly
modulates his tone by
playing on this boundary,
the real credit to his
skill as a guitarist is the
sheer apparent ease with
which he plays. Lage
throws up strange chord
voicings and makes great
melodic jumps in rapid
succession, stopping only
for an incidental bend or
arpeggio, before whisking
away on yet another
lovely jaunt deep into the
realms of music theory I
don’t understand.
Colley and Wollesen
are no slouches either.
You might recognize
them: Wollesen has toured
with Tom Waits, Norah
Jones, and Sex Mob,
while Colley has spent
time with Herbie Hancock
and Jim Hall. Lage is the
only member of the trio
without a Wikipedia page.
In fact, the story is
quite sweet - apparently,
Lage grew up watching
jazz jams at Yoshi’s;
at the time, Colley and
Wollesen played in the
house band, backing
touring soloists. Eventu-
ally, they played together,
and so the happy trio was
born.
Vibes on the album
range from a rustic
ramble (“Wordsmith”) to
Ornette Coleman-esque
free jazz (the fantastic
track “Earth Science”).
Every track is distinct
and worthwhile. “The
Ramble” rocks, “Look
Book” hits a chirpy stride
and plants itself there,
and “Roger the Dodger”
ambles whimsically in the
verse and grooves hard
through the refrain. Blues
and rock serve as motifs
on this album; Lage bends
genres into patterns that
stand testament to his
sheer musicality.
And yet, Lage has
matured. This is his
sophomore effort as
bandleader, and one that
paints him as becoming
more comfortable with
the role, more agile and
willing to play with new
ideas. He feels more per-
sonable, more expressive,
more rhythmically coy.
Arclight wasn’t a bad
album by any stretch of
the imagination - but it is
no terrible thing to have
the sophomore LP trump
the first stab.
To close on, I’m left
keen for the great things in
the trio’s future. Onwards
and upwards, lads.
By far the cheekiest thing on this record // Loma Vista
Despite rare glimmers of genius, the latest effort by soft rock outfit Rhye is disappointingly lackluster.
