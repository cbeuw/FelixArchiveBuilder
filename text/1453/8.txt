V
alentine‚Äôs Day is nearly
upon us and that can
mean only one thing.
Half of Imperial will be
burning through their
student loans in order to pay for an un-
forgettable night of passion with their
respective beau or paramour. The oth-
er half will be watching Love Actually
in the dark with a tub of Ben & Jerry‚Äôs
‚Äì totally sarcastically, of course. After
my last relationship, I‚Äôve regretfully re-
signed myself to the latter category.
We first met in Starbucks. Forsaking
the cornucopia of caffeine of the baris-
tas, I opted for a healthy bottle of wa-
ter. However, the next customer in line
took offence at this, being as he was the
Insanely Wired Coffee Wizard. I trem-
bled in fear as I stared into his crazy,
bloodshot eyes. Buzzing with rage, he
thrust me against the sandwich shelf
and unscrewed the lid of his Thermos
of Doom. I had disrespected his bever-
age once; I wouldn‚Äôt live to do so again.
But amidst the sea of frightened
coffee-shop patrons, my saviour arose.
The coffee around me was as black
as night, before a sudden almighty
crash! The Coffee Wizard crumpled
to the floor, crumbs cascading down
his greasy locks. Behind him, holding
the broken remains of a three-day-old
panino, stood Breakfast-Spread Girl.
Yes, Breakfast-Spread Girl ‚Äì jamming
up the toaster of evil with her but-
terknife of justice! Despite narrowly
avoiding a caffeinated fate, my heart
began to race and I began to sweat. I
wasn‚Äôt high on coffee, I was high on
love.
After a manly bout of swooning, I
woke up in the firm but graceful arms
of Breakfast-Spread Girl. Fearing for my
blood sugar, she immediately offered
me an emergency dollop of honey. As
I took it, our hands touched, our eyes
met and there were three heaped tea-
spoons of magic in the air.
Breakfast-Spread Girl might not be
the prettiest superhero ‚Äì indeed, she
couldn‚Äôt hold a candle to the more at-
tractive (albeit rather ineffectual)
Glamour Woman ‚Äì but she had a quiet
sexiness about her, in a junior librar-
ian kind of way. No, like a butter-laden
crumpet, her true beauty lay within.
She was smart and funny and had a wit
you could cut cheese with. Also, her
hair smelt like cinnamon. Whenever I
saw her, my legs went weaker than cot-
tage cheese on crackers.
And for a time, things were like gold-
en syrup. I was stuck on her and she
was so sweet on me. My housemates
were naturally jealous, saying how jam-
my I was to be dating a superhero ‚Äì it
drove them nutella!
But life is short and these sticky en-
tanglements are all too fleeting. At
first, it was just the small things. I fan-
cied raspberry jam, she favoured straw-
berry. Then I wanted to switch to mar-
garine and she would hear none of it. I
knew we were having problems when
we were fighting over which bread was
superlative. Wholemeal was better for
you, I argued ‚Äì but white tastes nice
toasted, she countered. But foolishly I
dismissed these as the differences that
endear couples to each other. How
wrong I was.We were watching a movie
one night, The Breakfast Club I think,
round her place, bodies close and toast
at hand. And then, out of the blue, she
said those words that would change our
relationship forever.
‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll have some marmite. Do
you want some?‚Äù The relationship had
landed butter-side down.
I suppose, on reflection, all that
sugar wasn‚Äôt good for me. Admittedly,
my dentist had said so from the start
but I think he was just jealous. But
Breakfast-Spread Girl was so sweet.
She spread sunshine across my life, and
wasn‚Äôt sparing with the portions either.
It pains me to think that she‚Äôs out there
now, fighting crime, while I‚Äôm here
alone, buttering my own bread.
But she did teach me that love is out
there and, like the peach preserve at the
back of the supermarket shelf, you just
have to reach for it...
...Even if it leaves crumbs on the sheets.
Rhys Davies gets his heart broken, sweetly
‚ÄúI knew we were
having problems
when we were
fighting over
bread‚Äù
