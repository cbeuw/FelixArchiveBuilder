Business School’s Tanaka imprisoned
I
f you are in second year or above,
you may remember the halcyon
days when Imperial College
Business School was called the
Tanaka Business School. The
name came from Gary Tanaka, a Jap-
anese-American fund manager who
did a PhD in Mathematics at Imperial.
He pledged £27 million to the College,
who thanked him by naming the new
Business School in his honour. In 2004,
the Queen thanked him for his gen-
erosity during the ceremony in which
she opened the new Business School
building.
But most of the money has yet to
come. On Friday, Tanaka was sen-
tenced alongside his business partner
Alberto Vilar for defrauding investors
of £13.5 million. They were both ar-

rested in 2005, after a private detective
hired by a concerned client discovered
that they had attempted to clear mil-
lions of pounds of debts with their
clients’ investments. The prosecution
alleged that the pair had stolen £3.4m
from Lily Cates, a 70-year-old Ameri-
can heiress who had been a client for
18 years.
Edward Adams, the private detec-
tive, claimed that Vilar and Tanaka had
used two-thirds of Ms Cates’ fund to
pay off another investor and £440,000
of the firm’s bills. Another £670,000 of
her money was used by Vilar to fulfil
a charitable pledge to Washington and
Jefferson College, and other personal
expenses. The court heard how Tanaka
had instructed his assistant, Maxine
Rye, to cut out Ms Cates’ signature
from a document and tape it to a fax
authorising the transfer of an extra
£170,000 from her brokerage account.
Tanaka was found guilty of three
counts of securities fraud, conspiracy
and investment adviser fraud but in-
nocent of nine other counts. Vilar was
convicted of all 12 charges.
Tanaka is the son of Japanese immi-
grants to America, who were interned
during World War Two. He was born
in a holding camp. After the family
were released, his father built a poul-
try business that enabled Tanaka to af-
ford to attend MIT. When he moved to
London for his PhD, he claimed to have
“fallen in love with swinging Beatles-
era London.” He met Vilar in 1980 af-
ter a career that took him around the
world, from San Francisco to the Mid-
dle East. Together they launched Am-
erindo Investment Advisors. The firm
invested in some of the most successful
firms of the dotcom boom, including
Microsoft, Cisco, Amazon and eBay.
At one point, they had more than £5
billion in client assets. But, after the
dotcom bust, their firm’s stock price
dropped by 90 per cent.
The presiding judge, Richard Sulli-
van said, “the investment world needs
to know this kind of behaviour cannot
be tolerated.” The judge is called The
Avenger for his crusade against allega-
tions of fraud.
Claiming innocence, Tanaka said,
“our documentation was lax and that
got us into trouble. I’m sorry for what
happened ... you think you’re going to
win the race and your horse comes
in last. I was surprised at the sever-
ity of the sentence. I feel innocent in
the sense that nobody lost money.
We were arrested and convicted on a
footnote.” He described the trial as “a
storm in a teacup.”
Gary Tanaka

million to
Imperial College
and was thanked
personally by
the Queen. He

A man called Tanaka and his business school
Gary A. Tanaka was born June 23, 1943 to Japanese parents in Hunt,
Idaho, within the compounds of the Minidoka concentration camp; it
was set up to detain Japanese-Americans across the US during World
War II.
He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then
studied for a PhD in Mathematics at Imperial College. He has two
sons who have followed in their father’s footsteps and are successful
businessmen.
Tanaka has great involvement in thoroughbred racing horses, owning a
major stable that has reared horses that have won races across the globe.
Living in London, he donated £27m for the construction of
Imperial’s new business school which was
subsequently named after him on opening
in 2004. The Tanaka Business School was
renamed the Imperial College School
in 2008; it is speculated that this
name change was in response
to Tanaka’s charge of
fraudulent activity.
