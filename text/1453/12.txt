ecently, we’ve had the revela-
tion of judge Cherie Booth al-
lowing a Muslim man to walk
free on “religious” grounds.
His sentence, for breaking someone’s
jaw in a fight in a bank queue, was sus-
pended because he was “a religious man”
who “had not been in trouble before”
.
Shamso Miah, of Redbridge, East Lon-
don, was charged with assault occasion-
ing actual bodily harm when he fractured
Mohammed Furcan’s jaw, in a row over
who was next in line at a bank in East
Ham. This simply sounds wrong, terri-
bly wrong. Wrong that he was let off in
the first place for a crime he quite clearly
commited (CCTV footage showed Mr
Miah striking Mr Furcan twice), but also
wrong that he was excused because he
had just been at his local mosque.
Is it that unreasonable to suggest that
someone of faith is less likely to offend
than a non-believer? Maybe not, but
you know that this is going to be tread-
ing very dodgy ground. The ruling has
been taken as unfairly discriminative
by the NSS (National Secular Society)
and you can clearly see their point.
Can’t someone have morals without
belief in a religion?
On the other hand I guess it is conven-
ient to make generalisations. Like any
follower of Anwar al-Awlaki must be
dangerous, right? In this case my opinion
would be yes. But principles like these
cannot be applied across the board.
Co-incidentally, however, findings
published in the journal ‘Trends in
Cognitive Sciences’ this week claim
that atheists are “just as ethical as
church-goers”. According to the study,
people who have no religion know
their right from their wrong just as well
as those who worship regularly.
The researchers found that most re-
ligious people were similar in having a
moral code, which helped to organize
society. However, people from a non-
Dr Jane Murray – a researcher from the Univer-
sity of Bristol – has published a paper in which
she claims that cat owners are likely to be smart-
er than dog owners. This was based on a poll of
2,524 households wherein a larger proportion of
the households with cats had people in poses-
sion of a degree. She claims that well educated
people prefer cats because they “work
late and have long commutes, and
because cats require less time per
day spent on them than a dog”. I tell
you what, if that rubbish counts
as scientific research then
maybe I’ve got a career in re-
search lying in wait for me
after all.
Bodywork batteries
Researchers at Imperial College are developing a prototype
material which may change the way we powereveryday
items. The material, made from carbon fibres and poly-
mer resin, will be both strong and lightweight, making it
a possible future alternative to the electric motors cur-
rently used in hybrid cars. Dr Greenhalgh, department of
aeronautics, says: ‘We think the car of the future could be
drawingpowerfromitsroof,itsbonnetoreventhedoor...’
The uses of the new material would not be limited to the
motor industry. The material could enable items such
as mobile phones to be powered by
their casing, giving future
phones the
potential to
be as thin as
credit cards.
Badger culls

Cat owners smarter
than dog owners?
Research published on Wednesday by
Imperial College and the Zoological Socie-
ty of London has shown that the benefits
of badger culling to reduce instances of
tuberculosis in cattle disappear within
four years of the cull. In 2008, over 2,700
herds were infected with the disease
and were slaughtered, costing the Gov-
ernment £100 million as a result. Badger
culling was decided against as a means of
controlling cattle TB in England two years
ago, but the Welsh Assembly is now pro-
posing to use culling methods similar to
those used in the study.

any human traits pose
an evolutionary paradox
and one such example is
depression. Research in
the US and elsewhere estimates that be-
tween 30 and 50 percent of people meet
psychiatric diagnostic criteria for a ma-
jor depressive disorder at some point in
their lives. However, the brain has a cru-
cial role in personal survival and repro-
duction so evolutionary pressure should
have developed the brain’s resistance to
these problems. Mental disorders should
be rare so why isn’t depression?
The existence of mental health prob-
lems would make evolutionary sense if
they were due to growing old as func-
tionality of organs tends to deteriorate
with age. However, in the case of de-
pression, people are most likely to have
their first experience during adoles-
cence and young adulthood. Equally,
a theory that it is a modern phenom-
enon developed through our new life-
styles is flawed as symptoms of depres-
sion have been found in every culture,
including the Ache of Paraguay and
the Kung of southern Africa – societies
thought to live in environments similar
to those in our evolutionary past.
The remaining possibility is that in
most instances, depression is not a
disorder at all. In an article published
in Psychology Review, it is argued
that depression is an adaption that
brings real costs and real benefits.
One reason to suggest that de-
pression is an adaption comes
from research into a mol-
ecule in the brain known
as 5HT1A – a receptor that
binds to serotonin, a neurotransmitter
linkedtodepression.Thischemicalisthe
target of most contemporary antidepres-
sant medications. When the receptor in
rodents is compared to that in humans,
it is 99 percent similar, suggesting that it
is so important that natural selection has
preserved it. The ability to be depressed
appears to be important, not an acciden-
tal malfunction.
Depression does cause problems for
those who suffer the disorder, so what
could be useful about depression? De-
pressed individuals often think intensely
and analytically about their problems,
breaking down the complexities of the
situation into smaller components con-
sideredoneatatime.Thistypeofthought
can be very productive. Research has
found evidence that people who get more
depressed while they are working on
complex problems in an intelligence test
tend to score higher on the test.
This type of analysis requires uninter-
rupted thought, and depression coor-
dinates physiological changes to help
people not be distracted. In a region
of the brain known as the ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), neurons
must be continuously firing to avoid
distraction. However, this is very ener-
getically demanding for these neurons
and can cause them to degrade. Studies
in rats
have shown that the 5HT1A receptor is
involved in supplying neurons with the
fuel they need to perform at this level.
These processes are important to allow
depressive analytical thought to con-
tinue uninterrupted with minimal neu-
ron damage, which may explain why
5HT1A is evolutionarily important.
Against this background, other
symptoms of depression make evo-
lutionary sense. The desire for social
isolation and the inability to derive
pleasure from activities including sex
prevent distractions and encourage
deep thought about an individual's
problems. Several studies have found
that this depressive rumination allows
for quicker resolution of depression.
Various studies have also shown that
people in depressed mood states are
more proficient at solving social dilem-
mas. This may be important enough
to drive the evolution of such a costly
mental state. Laboratory experiments
indicate that depressed people are bet-
ter at resolving these situations due to
better analysis of the costs and benefits
of different actions that they may take.
Unfortunately, often people are reluc-
tant to disclose the reasons for their de-
pression due to embarrassment, or a be-
lief that they must soldier on and ignore
the emotions. However, depression is a
natural way of indicating that you have
a complex social problem that the
brain is intent on solving. The
condition is a huge problem for
sufferers and one which should
be taken seriously. However,
when considering all the evidence
depression seems less like a dis-
order, and more like a highly
organised response that per-
forms a specific function.

religious background were also found
to have intuitive judgements of right
and wrong, to a similar extent.
Dr Marc Hauser from Harvard Univer-
sity, one of the co-authors of the research,
stated that he and his colleagues were in-
terested in the roots of religion and mo-
rality. He claims that “For some, there is
no morality without religion, while oth-
ers see religion as merely one way of ex-
pressing one’s moral intuitions”
.
The team looked at a number of psy-
chological studies which were designed
to test an individual’s morality. Dr Hauser
added: “The research suggests that intui-
tive judgments of right and wrong seem
to operate independently of explicit reli-
gious commitments. So Cherie, will you
