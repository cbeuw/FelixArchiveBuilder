New Guilds President found
Following the departure of Kirsty Pat-
terson, former CGCU President, the
City and Guilds College Union held
elections to appoint a new President
and Guildsheet Editor. The elections
attracted respective candidates Dan
Lundy and Richard Bennett, who at-
tained their positions unopposed.
Guildsheet is the monthly student
magazine of the Faculty of Engineer-
ing, rival to the Royal College Of Sci-
ence Union’s Broadsheet magazine.
The results of the elections were an-
nounced at noon on Monday. The
turnout to the elections was minimal,
with Lundy’s victory attributable to
the forty-one votes collected. Bennett
was elected by forty-seven votes, and
eighteen further votes lobbying to reo-
pen nominations. Taking into account
the turnout, this is a fair proportion of
the total votes, especially since twenty-
three voted to reopen nominations for

he Israeli military on Wednesday launched a bombing mission
on Yasser Arafat Airport, which is currently disused.
The strike on Rafah, a town in southern Gaza Strip, was target-
ted at tunnels used to smuggle goods into the Gaza Strip. No
casualties were reported. The attacks were reportedly in retaliation for
rocket attacks on Israel, which the Israeli Defence Forces claim have been
up to twenty in number this year. Hamas, which has control over Gaza,
says that it ceased rocket fire last year and blamed the attacks on other
militant groups. The strike shows a continuing desire for Israel to maintain
its blockade on Gaza.

G
eneral Sarath Fonseka, the loser of Sri Lanka’s presidential
election last month and the commander of the Sri Lankan
army during the conclusion of the Sri Lankan civil war, was
arrested Monday in a raid on his offices.
In July, Fonseka was appointed to a largely ceremonial post, Chief of De-
fence Staff, which set off the beginnings of a rivalry with President Mahinda
Rajapaksa, his former ally. Fonseka announced his retirement in November
and was asked to resign soon after, allowing his entry into politics and his
unsuccessful presidential bid. He is accused of improperly discussing poli-
tics prior to his retirement from the military, and will be court-martialed,
according to the government. On Tuesday, President Rajapaksa exercised
his right to dissolve Parliament, and called new elections in the hope of
capturing a two-thirds majority, despite growing clashes in Colombo over
Fonseka’s arrest.

K
im Jong-il, dictator of North Korea, seemed willing to return to
diplomacy over the past week.
Last Friday, North Korea released an American missionary
from custody. Robert Park, of Arizona, was arrested after cross-
ing the North Korean-Chinese border on Christmas Day. Park was car-
rying pamphlets calling on Kim to close the country’s prison camps and
to step down. Park’s release and flight to Beijing was seen as a measure
of goodwill on the part of North Korea. On Tuesday, during a meeting
between North Korean and Chinese officials in Pyongyang, Kim Jong-il
stated that he wished to “realise the denuclearisation of the Korean Penin-
sula”, according to Xinhua. Meanwhile, Lynn Pascoe, the most important
UN envoy to visit North Korea since 2004, visited Pyongyang to discuss
the resumption of six-party talks regarding the end of North Korea’s nu-
clear programme.

Whilst the rest of us were busy,
the Medics took part in the RAG
DASH to Amsterdam.
200 students gallivanted from London
to Canterbury to Amsterdam, raising
money along the way. Sex shows,
coffee shops, pub crawls and booze
buses were all involved.

the Presidential position.
Lundy commented on his victory
that he is ‘’very glad to be appointed
President’’ and is ‘’looking forward to
working with the rest of the commit-
tee to provide some great social events
and represent the Faculty on student
welfare issues.’’
Lundy will lead the CGCU until the
end of July, during which the entire
team will focus on attaining sponsor-
ships for next year whilst improving
their financial circumstances for the
future. Bennett’s position as Guild-
sheet editor will involve managing the
monthly magazine. He commented
that he ‘’would like to thank everyone
who voted’’ for him and hopes that the
‘’next edition of Guildsheet lives up to
everyone’s expectations.’’

A
utomakers Toyota and Honda have both been plagued by re-
calls of automobiles. Faulty accelerator pedals in a variety of
Toyota cars have caused accidents whereby the pedal sticks to
the floor and cannot be depressed. This week, Toyota recalled
436,000 hybrid cars with faulty brakes. On Wednesday, Honda recalled
an additional 437,700 cars with faulty airbags, with the recall now totalling
nearly one million cars. This airbag defect causes metal shards to explode
throughout the affected automobiles’ interiors upon airbag deployment.
