Akira live action film
resurrected
Vulture blog apparently has the
scoop that the classic anime film
is to be remade into a two part
film by the Hughes Brothers
fresh off their latest hit The Book
of Eli. Interestingly most Akira
Fans rejoiced when the project
looked dead last summer.
The cause of the mass destruction is
never explained and the audience is
never encouraged to care. The point
is everything has died. No plants or
animals have existed for the past few
years. It’s only the humans who have
survived, and since all we make is
trouble, this sets the perfect apoca-
lyptic scene. An unnamed man (Viggo
Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-
McPhee) struggle on, heading south,
hoping it will be warmer and more
habitable. Their journey is never easy
since man has turned against each oth-
er, resorting to theft, murder, rape and
cannibalism. The naïve son, who still
has his youth and innocence intact,
is desperate for them to be “the good
guys.” And the father doesn’t have the
heart to tell him that not everything
works that way. But of course, when
society has been damaged to such an
extent, survival involves getting your
hands dirty, an idea never fully grasped
by the boy who was born during the
most unfortunate times.
Smit-McPhee is convincing in his
purest, boyish form, shocked and hor-
rified at every dishonesty and moral
corruption from his surroundings.
Mortensen gives a truly moving per-
formance as the father who will do lit-
erally anything to protect his son; he’s
even prepared to shoot the boy himself
Everybody
loves Forest

A
couple of weeks ago I con-
troversially declared that
Forest Gump was not a
good film. Since then, nu-
merous people have ap-
proached me complaining that I slated
their favourite movie, one person even
looked like they were going to burst into
tears. Before an inquisition is started and
I’m burned at the stake for heresy, I feel I
need to explain my stance.
Firstly, by stating that Forest Gump is
not a good film, please don’t assume that
I meant it is a bad film. Compared to the
usual dross that is spewed out of Holly-
wood these days it stands rather favour-
ably. I would argue that the film is easily
above average in terms of quality but was
it worthy of all its Oscars? In my opinion,
no.
Let’s take a look at characters, one of
the film’s strongest points in many critic’s
views. The main protagonist Forest is un-
believably tedious, his naivety prevents
his character gaining any real emotional
depth. When he’s supposedly portraying
happiness, sadness or anger we are given
the same dumb expression. I understand
his childlike demeanour is intentional
so that his innocence and honesty can be
manipulated and abused by those around
him but by lacking any common sense, it’s
hard for the audience to relate to him. And
then there’s Bubba: simply Forest in black
skin. I know his friendship with Forest is
incredibly heartwarming but at the end
of the day he is just another idiot. Captain
Dan is another stereotype, selfish and suc-
cessful who loses everything before gain-
ing humility as Forest helps him rebuild
his life - Oh I wasn’t expecting that!
The only decent character in the whole
film was Forest’s love interest Jenny. She
had no quirky traits or crazy misfor-
tunes and I can truly sympathise with
how she constantly tries to run from the
moron Gump.
The episodic format of Forest Gump
is a lazy style of story telling with nu-
merous instances of Deux ex Machina
such as the storm during the fishing
scene. In fact the plot is essentially a
patchwork of pop-culture references
which becomes one joke too far very
soon. Forest teaching Elvis to dance?
It’s just ridiculous and though the
technology behind putting Tom
Hanks into famous news
footage is certainly impres-
sive, it’s not a premise to base
a film around.
MybiggestproblemwithForestGump
is the rather nasty conservative context
that lies underneath all the sentimental
codswallop. This attack on counter-cul-
ture is blatantly obvious once you look
for it; Forest Gump, clean cut and hard-
working is constantly successful whilst
never questioning anything. However
Jenny, who takes an alternative route in
life involving political activism, drugs
and sexual liberation eventually turns
out to be loser - she dies of cancer. The
Vietnam scenes are an insult to those
who suffered on both sides of the war,
the fact that Forest loses his best friend
and Dan his legs, yet they eventually
come out winners in stark contrast to
reality.
At the end of the day Forest Gump is
an enjoyable film but when you con-
sider that Pulp Fiction and The Shawk-
shank Redemption were nominated for
the Best Picture Oscar that Gump even-
tually won, its puzzling to understand
why everyone loves it.
I was originally going to write about a
terrible poster for the new film Percy
Jackson and the Lightening Thief (Every
bus stop from the Albert Hall to Ham-
mersmith has it displayed, take a look,
it is truly awful). Whilst browsing the
internet for such offending poster I
came across this beauty on slashfilm.
com and decided to comment upon my
admiration for it instead.
I’m instantly reminded of the Soviet
propaganda posters of Alexander Rod-
chenko, the film’s title ‘Connected’ is
printed in a very Russian style. I love the
scene of two figures against a minimal
backdrop, our eyes are immediately
drawn to the white tubes linking their
masks on their biohazard style suits.
I’m intrigued by the sense of mystery
the poster portrays, its simplicity is the
key and begs us to ask the question;
just what has happened to these
two people?
There is a short teaser
for the film on its website.
It looks in the similar vein as

Zombieland 2
confirmed
Zombieland was a surprisingly
good film, balancing horror
and genuine comedy. It now
appears that we due a second
helping of Woody Harrelson’s
bad-ass Tallahassee and this
time in glorious 3D with a script
specifically written for.
New Muppets film is
definately happening
We haven’t had a Muppets
instalment for a while now but a
new project has been given the
green light. The plot revolves
around Kermit and pals putting
on show that draws in 10 million
viewers to prevent new villain
Tex from destroying their studio.
