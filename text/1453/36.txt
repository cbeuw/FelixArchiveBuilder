COFFEE BREAK
felix FRIDAY 12 FEBRUARY 2010
It’s bloody Valentines Day so felix has gone on a date
It all started off exceptionally well with first-class chitter chatter and nibbles, but soon felix messed it up
Cancer
Finally, half an hour
late you get to leave
the house. You spend
ages pondering over
the final solution
tour destination. For
it would be a tour for one of those racial fellas.
You decied that you’d take her to a quintessential
English transport caf. You explain that the shouts
at her are not racially motivated. You have to lie.
You’ll always have to lie.
Virgo
It was going quite
well by the time felix
reached Virgo. You
woo her: I’d give up
forever to touch you,
‘cause I know that you
feel me somehow, you’re the closest to heaven
that I’ll ever be, and I don’t want to go home
right now. And all I can taste is this moment, and
all I can breathe is your life. ‘cause sooner or later
it’s over, I just don’t want to miss you tonight.
Gemini
So she says that she
just needs to get
ready. She puts on her
make-up and brushes
her long blonde hair.
And then she asks,
“Do I look all right?” And I say, “Yes, you look
wonderful tonight.” It’s reassuring to know that
she is a typical fucking woman who takes ages
to get ready. Men on the other hand, if we’re not
naked then it’s pretty much job done.
Pisces
However you started
thinking that maybe
your face is beautiful
and you log on to
www.nicethaibrides.
com and set yourself
up date. You just don’t want to be alone this
Valentine’s Day. Not after last year when you
wound up in Accident and Emergency with
a garden gnome up your arse. That took a
considerable amount of explanation.
Leo
Two lads lurch
towards you throwing
sausages. Maybe
it’s some sort of gay
invitation. Maybe it
isn’t. To look hard you
ask of them, “come on then... if you think you’re
hard enough.” That sounded very gay so they call
you a massive poofter and fuck off. You tell her
that you would stab them in the japs eye with the
ketchup bottle and they ran off scared. You lied.
Aries
So she arrives, and
she’s a fucking stunner.
Like a serious knob
exploding stunner. You
never knew that mail-
order brides can look
so fan-fucking-tastic. You check her over to see if
she has been shop-soiled or damaged in transit.
She hasn’t. Jurassic Park! You make idle chitter
chat, comment on her eyes and her short stature.
She says that she likes your dog. You get worried.
Scorpio
You join the BNP
and put an advert on
their web site. It reads
“Racists of this world.
This world should be
our world. Our world
void of all black, brown, and yellow (or any other
derivative) people. If you believe me, join my quest
to invade Thailand and get back at the makers of
www.nicethaibrides.com.” Lets be honest, you are a
fucking useless cunt.
Libra
She asks for a
translation and she’s
very much less than
impressed. Maybe they
don’t have the same
laws in Thailand. She
hits you with a pint glass. Rather uncalled for if
you ask me. You are not happy, and decide that
a full on invasion of Thailand is the only way to
get over it. That night you dream about Nazi
Germany. If only SW7 was more like that.
Taurus
Fuck it. She might
want to eat your
dog, but it’s only a
mongrel. You can
always get another.
Battersea have a
whole shitting shed full of them. You can always
get a new one there, besides, you’ll probably
be helping the overcrowding problem there.
Seriously it’s like Mecca when they’re doing their
Hajj. Or whatever they call it.
Capricorn
You were released-
although walking like a
penguin. Life is treating
you badly. You’ve
messed up your whole
life and want it to be like
it was before. When you were loved, not fisted. But
that can’t be done. You crawl into a hole and hope
you’ll never be found. However, some American
troops find you and call you Saddam... it gets
worse, you have one phone call. It’s engaged. Pint?
Aquarius
This week you’ve
been asked to take
photos for a casting
agency. They’ve
approached you on
the street and you’re
all flustered as they compliment your big face.
Wait, you don’t have a big face. Do you? I don’t
know. Maybe you do. Your face IS fairly big,
I’m not going to lie. Maybe you could get face
reduction surgery. No?

Sagittarius
You are reported to
the police who arrest
you an put you in a
cell with a burly man
called Bill. Bill was
impartial to anal, and
much preferred fisting. You had no choice but to
submit and Bill called Ben, who brought some
flowerpots. No I don’t know either. You were
bent over a duly given what can only be called an
extreme seeing to. The BNP laugh.
