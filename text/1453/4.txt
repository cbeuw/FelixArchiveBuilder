Guava Management are rotten fruit
I
suspect that many students at
Imperial, while sat bored in
lectures, dream of setting their
pens down and embarking upon
a glamourous career in mod-
elling and acting. I also suspect that
this daydream isn’t confined to the
glamour-deprived students of Impe-
rial. This is the demographic that com-
panies like Guava Talent Management
target, promising their victims the op-
portunity to work as an extra in TV
and film and also do a spot of model-
ling whilst making some money along
the way.
Unfortunately for the people who
sign up to ‘modelling agencies’ like
Guava Talent Management, the reality
is that the company is more interested
in taking your money than turning
you into a successful model. The scam
is fairly simple: the company’s “talent
scouts” approach you on the street
(some students have been accosted
near campus on High Street Kensing-
ton) and tell you that they’re looking
for potential models. They take your
details and also a photo; no mention
of costs is made. A couple of weeks
later they call you up and invite you
to The Light Rooms in Soho (a studio
that they own) so that they can make
a portfolio for you. Then, after you’ve
paid for your portfolio, the mountain
of modelling and acting work suddenly
disappears.
The company has a very profession-
al-looking website to lend the whole
operation an air of credibility. It claims
to be “the UK’s premier online talent
directory” and there are stylish photos
of models with unattributed testimoni-
als about the company like “Even with
last minute castings we get good qual-
ity talent and great service”. They even
promise you your own “personal cast-

The scam
The scam targets vulnerable
young females, promising any-
thing from casual extras work
to a glamorous professional
modelling career. After suck-
ing them in with a believable
performance on the street, the
girls are called up 2/3 weeks
later and told that they have
the perfect ‘look’. They are
then sweet-talked into a photo
shoot and lead to believe that it
only costs £100 for copyright
fees with the rest paid by the
company. Come the day of the
shoot, the costs quickly spiral
and some of the more trusting
victims have ended up spend-
ing over £1000 on a profes-
sional photographic portfolio
for booking agents who didn’t
even exist. The photo shoots
take place at one location, The
Light Rooms, which is owned
by the same person who owns
the ‘modelling agency’.
My run-
in with
Guava
I
am one of the many una-
ware students to have been
propositioned by, and agreed
to, naively in hindsight, this
seemingly good opportunity. I
was stopped on High Street Ken-
sington and told that I could do
modelling and extra work, and I
signed up. After talking you into
what seems a flattering and genu-
ine offer, these perfectly profes-
sional-sounding scouts take your
name and phone number as well
as photograph you to see if you
are right for any parts booking
agencies are currently recruiting
for.
After signing up I returned to
Imperial and did some Internet
research on the company using
the information on their business
card. This was when I discovered
that this “hoax” talent agency is
actually operating a nationwide
scam. There’s so much informa-
tion on the Internet about it, so
much that when you Google the
company, their website is way
down the results, after countless
blogs warning about the scam. It’s
actually surprising that they actu-
ally manage to con people.
After reading this I obviously
rushed straight back to High
Street to demand that my infor-
mation be deleted so I could not
be contacted. But seeing so many
names and numbers written in
her pad (literally hundreds), I re-
alised that many of these would
probably be other oblivious Im-
perial students. So, to whom this
concerns, it still remains that if an
opportunity sounds too good to
be true, then it probably is and is
not worth the risk.
ing booker.” In addition, the company
lists a a selection of their ‘associates’,
name dropping Channel 4 and Guess
Jeans, when in reality neither of these
companies have done any work with
Guava Talent Management.
The company isn’t part of the Asso-
ciation of Modelling Agents which says
that an agents’ income should be de-
rived solely from commision on work
obtained for their models.
Students should be wary of ‘agents’
that approach them on the street. Very
few succesful models were random-
ly discovered on the street and if in
doubt, there’s a wealth of information
on the Internet. A simple rule is that
if you’re being asked to pay for some-
thing upfront without any guarantee of
work in return, then alarm bells should
be ringing.
In the meantime, maybe it’s time to-
stop day-dreaming about the glamor-
ous world of modelling and start con-
centrating in lectures; exams are only a
few months away.
Zebra
Collections
& Vanity
Management
G
uava Talent Management
is just the newest incarna-
tion of a series of ‘model-
ling agencies’ that have
been abandoned when they’ve been
uncovered. All are owned by the same
man, Chris Garner, and have been in-
vestigated by the BBC’s Inside Out.
They showed that many young girls
had spent hundreds of pounds on
photo shoots at The Light Rooms for
potential jobs that never materialised;
the only difference to the Guava Talent
Management scam was the name of
the company; Zebra Collections.
Despite government regulations
to try and prevent agencies charging
upfront fees, the practice still contin-
ues. And despite the large number of
woman who have been scammed, the
company describe themselves as “a
freelance talent agency” which operates
as a recruitment firm, not as an employ-
er, so therefore never guarantees their
members any work. So in a legal sense
neither Chris Garner nor any of his staff
are doing anything that can be proven
to be breaking the law. Or the wrong agency for all people rth the risk.
