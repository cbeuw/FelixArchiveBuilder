Explorers wanted!
Imperial is steeped in history, and two
of our quirkiest legacies are to do with
exploration: the Mountain Hut (lo-
cated in Snowdonia, Wales) and the
Exploration Committee. While it may
seem incongruent that a Science, En-
gineering, Medicine and Business Col-
lege based in central London would
have these it seems that our alumni
were leaving us an unsubtle hint to get
out of the big city once in a while.
The Exploration Committee only
meets twice a year, but its expertise
can be sought year round. They are
able to allocate money and equipment
to expeditions but the members of the
board are also a wealth of knowledge
and experience.
But what is it that they are looking
for? After all, it seems like the world
is getting smaller and smaller and
not all of us can nip up to the top of
the tallest mountain. The committee
is well aware of this, and states that
‘other opportunities, including those
for culturally related exploration, still
remain strong’. The way that this is
implemented is with the mindset that
‘it is appropriate to offer support for
expedition-type activities that never-
theless demonstrate certain aspects of
exploration’.
However, one of the key features they
are looking for is that it is your own
idea, with your own planning and itin-
erary and should have clearly defined
aims and objectives. What they don’t
want is to hear about the next holiday
you’d like to go on or something that
you’re doing for credit on your aca-
demic course.
The crazy thing is that there are some
very modest students in our midst who
have benefited from the committee. A
brief cross-section of trips have includ-
ed a student-designed bridge-building
project in Altiplano, Bolivia, a filmed
documentary of a remote indigenous
population in Indonesia and most re-
cently, an exploration of East Green-
land, summitting three previously un-
explored mountains.

NEWS
TO,
THE EDITOR.
IN THE LAST ISSUE OF THE FELIX IT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT A NIGHTCLUB IS GOING
TO BE SET FOR THE STUDENTS.
THE EDUCATION ACADEMICS SHOULD TAKE A VOTE OR ASK FOR A REFRUNDUM ON THIS
ISSUE.I FEEL IT IS ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE OF ONE OF THE EVIL VICES PRESENT INSIDE
OUR ADULT BODIES AND MINDS.ALL THE UNDERGRADUATES AND POST GRADUATE STUDENTS
ARE INTILLIGENT ADULTS AND HAVE CHOOSEN TO DEVOTE SOME YEARS OF THEIR LIVES IN
PURSUIT OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND EVEN EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN BOUNDRIES OF SCIENCE
AND MEDICINE AND ENGINEERING.IF THEY FEEL THAT THEIR NEEDS OF HUMAN BODIES ARE
MORE THAN HUNGER AND SLEEP THAN EDUCATIONAL THERAPISITS SOULDBE CONSULTED.
RELAXATION IN A NIGHT CLUB IS NOT GOING TO EASE THEIR PATH TOWARDS ACHIEVING
THEIR GOALS IN THE LIMITED COURSE TIME SET..THE FINANCES USED TO SET THIS NIGHTCLUB
COULD BE USED TO HELP AN INTELLIGIENT POOR STUDENT FROM A THIRD WORLD TO BECOME
AN EXPERT AND EASE THE POVERTY IN HIS HOME COUNTRY. REALLY THIS TYPE OF EXTRAVA-
GANCE AT THE EXPENSE OF TAXPAYER AND THE STUDENT LIFE CAN BE AVOIDED.
A VISIT TO THE GYM OR OTHER NON TOXIC ACITIVITY WILL CONTRIBUTE NOT ONLY TOWARDS
BETTER RELAXATION BUT TOWARDS BUILDING A BETTER , BRIGHT,REWARDING AND MORE CON-
FIDENT FUTURE; OF WHICH IMPERIAL COLLEGE CAN BE PROUD OF AT THE TIME OF STUDENT
S COMING INTO THE LIMELIGHT OF THE WORLD GENIUSES. THE PLAN OF THE NIGHTCLUB
SHOULD BE DROPPED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION.
Thanking you

My dear James Lees [Politics Editor],
I found ‘felix’ sitting in a carriage on the Central Line on friday (5th Feb.) and I picked it up and read your arti-
cal with interest. I hope you don’t mind me telling you that no Catholic bishop in England and Wales “maintain
seats in the House of Lords, and as a result still have some say in the running of the country”
.
It is the Bishops of the Church of England who maintain seats in the House of Lords and, therefore, have some
say in the running of the country.
With kind regards,
John Tuohy
Catholic Priest
Dear John Tuohy,
Thank you very much in regards to your email about the article in felix. You are indeed correct that it is only Bishops of
the Church of England who hold seats in the House of Lords - the so-called ‘Lords Spiritual’. The error was due to having
not kept up with the story around Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connel. I had assumed (wrongly) that after he had been
offered a position in the Lords and had been keen to take the position, he would now be seated in the House. It turns out
that the Pope (allegedly at least) barred the Cardinal from taking the position.
Anyway, I’m sure you knew all that as you correctly asserted there being no Catholic bishops in the Lords. My sincere
apologies for the mistake, and my sincere thanks for reading the article and getting in touch.
Kind regards,
James Lees, Politics Editor
IC’s Welsh advisory
Welshman and Imperial professor
John Harries (Chair in Earth Observa-
tion, Department of Physics) has been
appointed as Wales’ first Chief Scien-
tific Adviser. He will take up the post
on 1st May, promoting science in the
policy-making of the Welsh assembly,
and challenging ministers on their
decisions. In this post he will be the
Welsh counterpart of England’s Chief
Scientific Adviser John Beddington,
also a current professor at Imperial
(Applied Population Biology).
Harries has previously been President
of the Royal Meteorological Society and
the International Radiation Commis-
sion, as well as being a fellow of the IOP
and winning its Charles Chree Medal
and Prize. Other high profile positions
have included Associate Director and
Head of the Space Science Department
at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
and Director of Projects and Technol-
ogy at the British National Space Cen-
tre. He is particularly well known for
leading the team which published the
first observational evidence of increase
in the Earth’s greenhouse effect in 2001
for records between 1970 and 1997.
The appointment comes three years
after former first minister Rhodri
Morgan first commissioned a report
in 2007 into whether Wales needs a
governmental scientific adviser at all,
following the appointment of Scot-
land’s first Chief Scientific Adviser in
2006. The news also comes after much
speculation last year that the Welsh as-
sembly would eliminate the position
due to a lack of funds.
Harries has said of his appointment,
“Wales is a small country, but is capa-
ble of the intelligent application of new
science and engineering as a basis for
greater commercial success in industry
... This is a job that encompasses two
(along with my family and rugby) of my
great passions – science and Wales.”
Governmental scientific advisers
remain in the spotlight after the deba-
cle in October when Professor David
Nutt was sacked from the chair of the
Advisory Council on the Misuse of
Drugs for expressing his professional
opinion. After the resignation of five
of the committee, it is in danger of
losing two more scientists this week,
after governmental proposals have
been slammed for being designed to
stop advisers publicly disagreeing
with government policy.
