Vince Lombardi: “The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather in a lack of will.”
Quote of the Week
Wordoku 1,453
Solution 1452
How to play:
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters. Complete the puzzle and then
send the whole grid to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the word alone. It’s not
an anagram.
Evil Wordoku is exactly the same... only harder... and
there’s a letter missing... that MAY be a duplicate -
just solve it like normal and insert the letter that you
believe makes the word.

I was *expletive*
censored

ast week, I went off on a bit of
a rant about the inconsequen-
tial goings on of life. As a re-
sult I was censored. Personally
I believe a few well placed expletives
have the ability to get your point across
1) much faster and 2) much clearer.
For example, the phrase ‘fuck off’
does not mean ‘go away’. Neither
does it mean ‘please leave me alone.’
It means ‘get out of my sight, you are
really beginning to annoy me and I’m
about to get angry.’ Now would you
ever say that? Err no. So ‘fuck off’ it is.
Now that got me to thinking about
some of the common expletives we use
in day to day life. What do they really
mean? One of my personal favourites
is ‘bugger off’. This literally means,
‘go have anal sex with another man.’
Where does that come from? Similarly
the word ‘cretin’, is an often used word
to describe someone who is being a
bit of an idiot (or moron). Now cre-
tin originally derives from the French
word crétin. This actually originates
from the French dialectal word for a
deformed and mentally retarded per-
son found in certain Alpine valleys.
Not even the whole of shitting France!
That moves me onto ‘shit’, a.k.a poo.
‘Shit’ is thought to have derived from
two places: the old English verb ‘sci-
tan’ which means to split or devide.
Later, circa 1585 the noun ‘scitte’ arose
which defined purging or excrement.
‘Shit’ was not considered to be taboo
until after 1600, and rarely appeared
in print- not even in all Shakespeare’s
writings. It still caused anger as late
as 1922 (in Ulysses) and was omitted
from some dictionaries as recently as
1970 in the Webster’s New World.
From this word, numerous derivi-
taves arose- the past participle ‘shat’
and the comical ‘shite’. But it’s biggest
claim to fame is the phrase ‘the shit
has hit the fan.’ This was described by
Hugh Rawson in 1989: “The expres-
sion derives from an old joke. A man
in a crowded bar needed to defecate
but couldn’t find a bathroom, so he
went upstairs and used a hole in the
floor. Returning, he found everyone
had gone except the bartender, who
was cowering behind the bar. When
the man asked what had happened, the
bartender replied: ‘Where were you
when the shit hit the fan?’ ”.
mmmmmm.....
Wordpath 1,453
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORD -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would
be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.

GLT found this nice
four step solution.
It wasn’t the first or
the shortest, but it
was the first, shortest
valid solution!
A few submissions
tried to use “IEST”
but this is not a
word according to
the Oxford English
Dictionary! Sorry.

This week’s winner
was The Tough Brets.
They even correctly
deduced the solution
phrase:
“AXE WOUNDS”
Even though it was
ruined by our Puzzle
Commodore messing
uptheWordokuagain-
this time, obviously, by
getting the ‘O’ and ‘U’
the wrong way round.
Don’t worry, he’s been
disciplined and has
assured us that this
issue’s puzzles are all
error-free.
Caption Competition 1,453
How to play:
Come up with a hilarious caption for one or more of these photos. Funniest/ cleverest caption gets the points (as decided by
the felix office). Yeah, it’s subjective but if you keep us happy we produce better work and there’s an iPod nano in it for you.
