SPORTS COMMENT
T
he 44th Super Bowl. The
greatest show on earth.
Dbs. The finest bar on
Princes Gate. It was writ-
ten in the stars.
With our friends from across the At-
lantic pouring in, the atmosphere was
electric for yet another cracking Sun-
day night at the Union. Despite never
having watched American ‘football’
and having a pretty bad impression
of it on the whole (only the boys with
long hair and Metallica t-shirts seem
to follow it over here) I sat down with a
couple of Snakebites (Coors light? No
thanks Union, don’t want to get too
carried away) to enjoy the game.
Personally, I find actual English foot-
ball, particularly since the inception

of sky and the rise of Andy Gray, to
be overly hyped. See Sky Sports Su-
per Sunday next week for an incred-
ible amount of alliteration as well as
featuring the titanic clashes that won’t
be; Aston Villa vs. Burnley and Totten-
ham vs. Wigan. Mouth watering. The
bubble of hype surrounding the Super
Bowl was different though. It was mas-
sive. Everything is epic, from the build
up, the stats upon stats, this year’s sto-
ry of Katrina and New Orleans, right
through to the half time The Who con-
cert. They even celebrate every tackle.
It’s the way they do things over there.
Such incredible, often ridiculous
hype does seem to work for the Super
Bowl though, creating an exciting at-
mosphere of fervour. Though I don’t
know what it’s like most years, or in-
deed most games, for me Super Bowl
44 did not disappoint.
Pre-match the Indianapolis Colts
were favoured over the New Orleans
Saints, with quarterback Peyton Man-
ning apparently one of the greatest of
the game and a cert to be inducted into
the hall of fame. A record distance pass
from Manning soon saw a touchdown
that had the Colts ahead and after two
kicks from someone for the Saints, the
game went into half time at 10-6 Colts.
The actual ‘football’ seems to be only
half the spectacle for America though.
The game is constantly punctuated
by advert breaks, a trait I couldn’t un-
derstand before watching ‘football’
though which I now see as natural for
such a short play game. In much of the
pre- and post-match media these ad-
verts themselves somehow seemed to
generate stories. Acts such as Michael
and Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake,
Beyonce, Prince and now The Who
mean that half time is barely even a
break for the record millions of arm-
chair viewers across America, and in-
creasingly, the world.
The 2nd half kicked off as if we’d
never left as Saints’ coach Sean Payton,
who had already showed his willing-
ness to innovate earlier in the game,
sent instructions to open with an on-
side kick. This is essentially a short
kick aimed at keeping possession rath-
er than limiting the opponent’s yards,
usually reserved for late desperation.
The move succeeded, however and in
the following play the Saints scored a
touchdown and successfully converted
to pull 13-10 ahead. A game changer
that was as thrilling to watch as Felix
is to read.
By the time Tracy Porter’s intercep-
tion and subsequent run had secured
the Super Bowl for the Saints (ironi-
cally off a Manning throw) I , as well
as many others in the union I’m sure ,
had long been convinced by American
Footballs epic claims to greatness.
And so the greatest show on the
planet is over. I might just grow my
hair, break out the black greasepaint
and join American football soc. Un-
til then. Eastside for Tottenham vs.
Wigan?
“Everything is epic,
from the build-up
to...The Who. They
even celebrate
every tackle. It’s the
way they do things
over there.”
