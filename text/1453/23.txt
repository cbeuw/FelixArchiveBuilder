Micmacs
From the genius who gave us Amelie
Micmacs starts very sombrely; a sol-
dier crouching over a landmine, gin-
gerly sweeping the dirt off its surface
amongst the cruel barenness of the
desert. The camera cuts to a longshot
and the mine suddenly explodes in the
soldiers face throwing him high into
the air. This sounds like a step into
darker themes for Jean Pierre Jeunet,
the man who gave us the surreal bril-
liance of Delicatessen and the anarchic
spirit of Amelie.
But we are soon back to familiar ter-
ritory as we introduced to the unfortu-
nate soldier’s young son Bazil. A brief
montage then depicts our protago-
nist’s childhood who appears to have
adopted the misfortune of his father.
Bazil accidently ends up with a bullet
lodged in his brain, removing it might
make him a vegetable and so the sur-
geons leave it in though he now car-
ries the risk of dropping dead at any
minute. Ending up on the streets af-
piece and the family of second-hand
dealers that Bazil joins is full of wacky
personalities for the audience to laugh
with, cringe at and admire. Most mem-
orable of these characters is Remington
(Omar Sy), displaced from his home-
land in the Congo and constantly recit-
ing proverbs and other words of wis-
dom, his impersonation of a Nigerian
gangster is very amusing.
Of course a Jeunet film would not be
complete without Dominique Pinon
who easily slips into the role of the in-
destructible Buster, keen to please but
slightly creepy. With names like Slam-
mer, Calculator, Tiny Pete and Elastic
Girl you can imagine that the rest of
the gang are of a similar zany standard.
The film looks fantastic, combining
the run down, antique-style aesthet-
ics of Delicatessen with the classic ar-
chitecture of Paris most lovingly shot
in Amelie. Micmacs is Delicatessen’s
spiritual successor and there is even
a cheeky reference slipped in at one
point.
The most novel aspect of Micmacs
is that the characters appear to aware
that their existence is a fabrication, the
soundtrack is perceived by Bazil as the
perfect accompaniment to his current
predicament such as a full orchestra
playing a crescendo to a dramatic mo-
ment. The film’s publicity posters are
even prominently displayed on various
billboards during the film.
The plot is basically a heist movie in
disguise but instead of lengthy explana-
tions of the gang’s schemes we are left
to follow their activities and for large
part of the film you are left in amaze-
ment trying to understand what just
happened. The story progresses like
clockwork, every device clicking
into place throwing twists and turns
that keep you on the edge of your seat
throughout.
This only possible with the steady
hand of Jean Pierre Jeunet on the pac-
ing and smooth transitions betweens
scenes so the film never looks like a
series of set pieces randomly sewn to-
gether. The climax is wonderful exam-
ple of a how a yellow-tinted lens can
make a big difference which will leave
your jaws hanging.
The script is very strong too, a ro-
mantic subplot between Bazil and
Elastic Girl is eloquently presented and
the film’s villains compare themselves
to Rimbaud (who apperently was a gun
runner). With a great script, cast and
direction Micmacs should be a classic,
but it isn’t. The originality which made
Amelie and Delicatessen so unique has
now faded into Deja Vu. I hate to say it
but at times Micmacs felt a little sterile,
as if the creativity had been forced into
the film. Overall though, it is a highly
enjoyable film and definately another
hit for Jeunet showcasing
the extensive talent this
French director
has.
