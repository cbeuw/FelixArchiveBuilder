FAN DEATH
A COIN FOR THE
WELL
MERCURY
EP
Fan Death wear the most awesome
clothes and I won’t lie, that is the main
reason I like them. This EP shows that
there is some substance to Fan Death
under all those frilly, lacey, layers of
style. Also, the track “reunited” has one
of the best music videos I’ve ever seen.
- Alexandra Ashford
Indie may have had its day but Bom-
bay Bicycle are the reminder of why
it became popular in the first place.
Their songs are perfectly formed and
their lyrics are catchy and moody at
the same time. This song is brilliant
and best heard as part of their similarly
brilliant album. - Kadhim Shubber
NATASHA SOHL
DIRTY LITTLE
WORD
GRANITE
ALBUM
This girl looks like Fern Britton’s idea
of punk. A GMTV-friendly Avril
Lavigne-alike. The first sentence of the
inside booklet says, “thanks to everyone
who put me down... you spurred me to
prove you wrong!” so I know she won’t
mind me saying it’s shit. Now go prove
me wrong. - Alexandra Ashford
BOMBAY
BICYCLE CLUB
EVENING/
MORNING
UNIVERSAL
SINGLE
Better than most generic indie, the
song has a rolling melody and a con-
stant scribbled guitar riff overlaid with
faraway vocals (no literally it sounds
like the guy stood too far away from the
mic during recording). I’ll probably not
listen to this song again after finishing
this review - Kadhim Shubber
NEW BOYZ
SKINNY JEANZ
AND A MIC
WARNER BROS.
ALBUM
Unlike most rappers, these two cute lit-
tle kids like their jeans skinny. They’re
like a less goofy Keenan & Kel rapping
fresh funny lyrics over stripped down
minimal beats. Though they clearly
borrow heavily from the Neptunes,
this sounds pretty new and cool.
- Alexandra Ashford
ARCHIE
BRONSON
OUTFIT
SHARK’S TOOTH
DOMINO
SINGLE
and I’m having my expectations raised
by the album until a totally superflu-
ous guitar solo begins to masturbate
the song to death. Unfortunately this
is not an isolated occurrence. It seems
every time, just as I find something
that makes me more interested in a
song, some musical wankery appears
slap-bang in the middle that makes me
switch off. The album comes across as
it’s trying to be anthemic pop, which
it comes some way to succeeding, but
it is missing a song with a killer hook
or catchy line.

TOKYO
HED KANDI
COMPILATION
This compilation has lots of the big
dancefloor bangers you will have
heard on your last lads on tour/girls
night out on the lash, mixed in with
lots of cheesy, cheesy house. Despite
being to club music what Hersheys is
to chocolate, lots of people will like
this.- Alexandra Ashford
Whether you like Owl CIty will de-
pend on how loosely you define plagia-
rism. It simply feels like Give Up has
been put though a blender with the ad-
dition of boy band backing music. And
let’s not forget the must have vocal ac-
cessory of the moment, autotuning. -
Christopher Walmsley
GOLDHAWKS
WHERE IN THE
WORLD
MERCURY
SINGLE
I was hoping this band might be in-
spired to recreate the joys of Sheppy B’s
Goldhawk road in musical glory. The
African fabric shops, the falafel stalls,
the weed dealers and fake rhinestoned
Nikes. No, they are actually trying to
recreate the sound of Bon Jovi, diluted
and tuneless. - Alexandra Ashford

ALBUM
Most listened to this week by
Felix Music members on last.fm
1. Radiohead
2. Bloc Party
3. The Beatles
4. Coldplay
5. Florence & TM
6. Red Hot Chili Peppers
7. Muse
8. Hot Chip
9. Foo Fighters
10. MGMT
So you’re all still depressed and
listening to Radiohead. Shocker.
I’m not sure how the Beatles have
scuttled their way up the charts,
they haven’t released anything in
ages. As always, this chart does
not reflect the snobby tastes of
the Felix staff
- Alexandra Ashford
Musical Mathematics
Finally, music in a language that you geeks can understand
If you’re like me, you’re probably
more familiar with Ok Go with their
inspired choreography in their mu-
sic videos than their music. The lead
single WTF? sets the tone punching
into a groove with choppy-funk guitar
strewn over the top. The chromatic
vocal melody in the verse works well
