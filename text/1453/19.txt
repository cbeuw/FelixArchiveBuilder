L
ast September I went to Besti-
val with a group of my friends
(pictured) and the series of
events that unfolded made me
determined to visit the Isle of Wight
every year for the festival, come wind,
rain, snow or shit performances from
MGMT.
The lineup speaks for itself but it’s
the friendly and relaxed atmosphere
and the other entertainment on offer
that really makes the festival what it
is. Each year the festival has a theme,
and last year it was outer space. This
meant that in various areas of the site
you could help build a massive card-
board spaceship, or get free face-paint
or build your own alien costume to go
raving in.
In the camping area, you don’t have
to beware exploding camping stoves
like at Reading and you can usually use
the toilet without much hassle (or if
you’re an absolute ponce, you can pay
extra to use the “comfy crappers”, like
our bacteriophobic Editor Dan Wan).
The festival is like closure for the
summer. It’s the final bit of uninhibited
fun before you come back to London
to find a flat and study.
