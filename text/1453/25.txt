1. Petticoat your circle dress to
make a grand entrance ala Isla Fischer
in Confession of a Shopaholic.
2. Swap roses for hydrangeas. A
vastly more stylish choice.
3. Cheongsam for Chinese New
Year? The day dresses were popular in
Hong Kong up until 1960, when they
were replaced by more functional
clothing. Cheongsam is now con-
sidered party-wear for special func-
tions. Maggie Cheung’s cheongsam
was seen in Wong Kar-wai’s Canne
Film Award winner - In The Mood for
Love. The costume was designed by
William Chang.
4. Some lingerie to spice up the
night? Bordelle is the only lingerie at-
elier that matters now. Fact.
5. Want to dress up and impress
your missus? Do it properly lads!
Follow the instruc-
tions to tie the
perfect bowtie.
Bin those elastic
fakes...
6. A face veil adds demureness.
7. A walk in Paris with a bad boy?
How about just watch A Bout de
Souffle with a nice boy/girl?
8. Following the rebirth of the 70s
on the recent runways, visit the ar-
chive of Biba’s flamboyant styles of
the 60s and the 70s.
9. 50s lingerie classics. Think
Marilyn Monroe. Grace Kelly. Sex
bomb and elegance in a set.
10. Bad shoes is a lame excuse
for a piggy-back. Natacha
Marro offers fantasy and
comfort in a pair!
11. Head for the best cock-
tails and most chilled out at-
mosphere in town. Order a Japanese
Rocking Horse at Loungelover.
12. No diamond ring is ever big
enough. The London Eye viewed
from the back of the Horse
Guards is. Go at night.
