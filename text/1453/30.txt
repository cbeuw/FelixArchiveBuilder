Browser war over Video
Feroz Salam looks at the state of HTML5 video in your browser
F
or roughly the last 5 years,
there have been two undisput-
ed kings of the browser mar-
ket – Internet Explorer from
Microsoft and Firefox from Mozilla
Corporation. With a combined 86%
of the market in their pockets, even
Google has had a hard time making a
dent in the market, despite widespread
publicity. This state of affairs looks like
it’s about to change in the near future
however, with Google’s own Chrome
browser picking up more market share
than either Firefox or IE for the entire-
ty of 2010. In addition, if Google con-
tinues to use the new HTML5 standard
with the h.264 video codec in YouTube
videos, they could be signing the death
knell for Firefox, in a cunning manoeu-
vre that could see them simultaneously
bringing YouTube into the HTML5 era
while grabbing a chunk of the browser
market share for Chrome.
HTML5 is the next evolution of the
HTML language that brings a whole
new set of functionality to webpages.
One of the most noticeable features of
HTML5 is the ability to embed stream-
ing video without having to install any
sort of plugin like Adobe’s Flash, the
current favourite video distribution
platform, or Microsoft’s Silverlight.
What this should mean is that your
average user doesn’t have to worry
about the hassle of installing and up-
dating plugins on a regular basis just
to watch a few clips; removing another
source of browser vulnerabilities and
crashes. YouTube already supports
the new HTML5 tag, and users can
watch HTML5 video by signing up for
the HTML5 Beta testing group. Yet
Firefox, Opera and IE users without
Google’s Chrome Frame need not ap-
ply. Neither Microsoft or Mozilla have
bothered implementing the h.264 co-
dec, despite the fact that it would be a
major step forward for browser tech-
nologies. With Microsoft, the issue
seems quite simple, they are probably
waiting to see how the codec/platform
wars will play out before they make a
decision on implementing any one,
especially as they are promoting their
own platform, Silverlight. With Fire-
fox however, the issue is much deeper,
involving questions about the very
nature of free software design and the
ethos behind the Mozilla Foundation.
The h.264 codec is a proprietary
video codec which therefore means
any company that wants to include
it has to pay a hefty licensing fee be-
fore they can build compatibility into
their software. Opera software, the
manufacturers behind the Opera fam-
ily of browsers, has refused to pay the
licensing fee outright, citing the high
cost of the license. The concern that
the Firefox developers have, however,
is quite different. In a blog post, one
Mozilla developer stated that licens-
ing H.264 “would violate the princi-
ples of free software that we strongly
believe in”. He also went on to say that
“we have leverage to possibly change
the codec situation” in relation to why
they don’t use the h.264 codec on the
user’s system and instead support the
open source Ogg Theora video codec.
This is essentially Mozilla hinting that
it expects their refusal to implement
the proprietary codec to send a strong
message prompting developers to re-
think the platforms that they use to
distribute media.
I’m very sceptical about the validity
of this argument. While Mozilla taking
the moral high ground is admirable,
internet users are faced with a plethora
of choices when it comes to browsers,
most notably the WebKit based brows-
ers, Chrome from Google and Apple’s
Safari. Both Google and Apple, who
uses h.264 extensively in its Quick-
Time video format, have handed over
the licensing fee, making them two of
the very few companies that can offer a
browser with full h.264 video capabili-
ties right out of the box.
As more and more users and web-
sites switch to the HTML5 tagging
system for embedded video, and likely
follow the lead of YouTube with h.264,
those with Firefox will simply down-
load other browsers, without even
concerning themselves with the ethical
issues behind Mozilla’s refusal to pay
the licensing fee. The end result will
probably be a choice of two outcomes;
the first being that Mozilla leaves their
moral high ground and finds a way
to license the proprietary codec, or
that Mozilla is driven to obscurity in
a matter of a few years. As someone
who believes strongly in open source,
I wish it could be any other way – but
given a choice between driving Firefox
to oblivion and licensing the codec, I
would pick realism over idealism and
license it.
Y
ou could be forgiven for
thinking that the tech world
revolved around Apple and
Google recently. If it’s not
the iPad, the Nexus One or the Google
China spat, it’s that Schmidt and Jobs
are falling out of love.
This week Google dropped its new-
est baby, Buzz, for all the world to see,
attempting to muscle in on all this so-
cial stuff the cool kids seem to be into
these days. Not another Wave I hear
you say. We haven’t found a use for
even that yet! Hold faith dear readers;
one day Wave will make perfect sense,
just ask the Tech team here at felix
towers.
In a nut-shell, Google Buzz is an-
other social networking environment
where you can share stuff with your
friends. But Buzz is a little more than
that. Those familiar with FriendFeed
and other social networking aggrega-
tors, might find that they’ve seen most
of it before. Buzz automatically pulls
status updates and other things from
places like Twitter, Blogger and flickr
shoving them right into your Google-
sphere experience. Buzz works directly
in Gmail allowing you to share stuff
with your private and public Gmail
contacts, linking public postings in
with your Google Profile page for all
the world to see. If you happen not to
have a Google Profile, Buzz will auto-
matically create you one, leading to yet
another way to find you through your
favourite search engine.
Google’s big on algorithms, its
PageRank system is one of the most
complex currently used on the web
today. Buzz doesn’t escape this pas-
sion either, featuring a recommenda-
tion engine that puts ‘Buzz’ from peo-
ple you don’t follow that it thinks you
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
Another week, another Apple
story; this time it might even
interest students. Several text-
book publishers have signed
on to distribute their wares
via a company called Scroll-
Motion, who are the folks be-
hind the Iceburg Reader on
the iPhone. The deal includes
McGraw-Hill, Houghton Mif-
flin Harcourt K-12, Pearson
Education and Kaplan Inc and
others are said to be in talks.
Could this see the iPad becom-
ing the one student-friendly
device to rule them all? Unless
you’re likely to pay through the
nose for electronic forms of
these textbooks, I doubt it. But
you have to admit textbooks
on a device like the iPad is an
attractive thought. Let’s just
hope they get the text search
done right so you don’t have to
sift through pages upon pages
of irrelevant rubbish to find
that golden paragraph you’ve
been looking for.
The iPad alterna-
tive, the Joo-
Joo was
also in
the news
this week
with the an-
nouncement
that it too
has an App Store
(doesn’t every- one these
days?) - a webapp store. Fusion
Garage argue, quite rightly so,
that the iPad has a large ad-
vantage provided by the cat-
egorised and searchable App
Store. They plan on making a
webbapp based store in a simi-
lar fashion. Let’s just hope they
make a better stab at
webapps than Ap-
ple did when it
said webapps
are ‘the only
apps you
need’. Ha,
yeah right.
More sexts got
into the news this week
too. For those not familiar
with the term; a sext is a sexy
text often in the news because
of minors sending nude picture
messages to each other. Idiots.
Anyway, one poor bloke from
Winnipeg, Canada got caught
with some luscious sexts on his
phone by his girlfriend, seem-
ingly from another woman.
Problem is Darren P, as he was
named by local press, didn’t
know where they’d come from.
Turns out that the pranksters
from Virgin Mobile pre-loaded
Darren’s new Samsung phone
with some pretty innocent
texts with things like ‘Booty
Call’, ‘Where you at’ and ‘Be
there soon’. Now why a phone
would come pre-loaded with
text messages, God knows,
but way to overreact! It wasn’t
until Darren went to the shop
and they found the texts on all
the phones of the same model
that Darren was proclaimed
innocent. Not sure whether
they reconciled their differ-
ences but if I were Darren I’d
think twice before taking little-
miss crazy back. After all, who
in their right mind uses the
phrase Booty Call?
Good news for
those of you who
are Freeview
users, as the
service is get-
ting two new
channels. The space
has been made available by
the BBC ahead of the digital
switch-over by the discontinu-
ation of its multi-screen red
button option – ahead of its
BBC HD launch, and also from
Arquiva through ‘technical
improvements’. No doubt the
folks behind Dave are eyeing
up the opportunity to bring
you more of what you’ve al-
ready seen.
Nvidia this week launched
its new Optimus technology,
which allows seamless and au-
tomated switching of GPUs
between discrete and integrat-
ed chips. Great news
for laptop
wielders as
the technol-
ogy has been
around for a
while with manual
switching, but automated,
on-demand switching will
make the best of both worlds,
saving more battery life. Look
for Optimus packing laptops to
hit the shelves by March.

might like, in your stream, based on
what you and your friends follow and
comment on. Using further automated
processing, Google will try and root
out ‘bad buzz’ like ‘I just ate an apple’
or ‘Going to the bog’ by automatically
collapsing it whilst prioritizing your
stream for what it thinks is ‘good buzz’.
Buzz will even push things into your
Gmail inbox when someone com-
ments on something you’ve posted or
commented on and when someone
sends you a direct message Twitter
mention-style with the now synony-
mous @reply.
That’s not all, because Buzz is go-
ing mobile too. It’s integrated into the
Google mobile home page via a Buzz
icon. Tapping on said icon will locate
you and try and place you in a real
location like a shop, coffee house or
pub, whichever fits closest with your
geographic location. A mobile Buzz
webapp is also available for iPhone
and Android which allows you to post
to buzz, see updates from people you
follow and from those located close
by. Those with an Android phone get
a little more Buzz in their lives than the
rest of us, with its integration into the
Google Maps app on the platform. The
Buzz layer allows you to snap your lo-
cation to an address and post to Buzz
straight from the Maps app. Other
mobile OSs are going to see a roll out
in the near future, with Blackberry,
S60 and WinMob getting in on the
act. iPhone users will have to wait for
an update before Maps sees any Buzz
action.
Those already in the Google-sphere,
look out for it in Gmail and other
Google services. For the rest of us, well,
if you haven’t already jumped aboard
the Google train, Buzz is unlikely to be
