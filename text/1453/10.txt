AnrgyGeekwith this week’s offering
T
here’s something about
group work at Imperial
that just brings the best
out of people, isn’t there?
It’s like a cross between
Ocean’s Eleven and that scene from the
Power Rangers where everyone teams
up and combines into a giant robot
penis.
I think everyone knows how shit
group work is, because my depart-
ment does its best to hide the fact
that a piece of work is to be done in a
group until the very last moment, as if
there’s a small chance some of us will
just quit the degree if we find out too
early. But eventually, with a crush-
ing inevitability, the group work will
come. It will find you. And then the
process goes a little something like
this.
First, you’ll find your go-to partner.
The one person you can rely on not
to urinate a little between the pages
of the report just before you hand it
in. You’ll look at each other across the
lecture hall and just give a little nod,
like you’re in an episode of Hustle or
something. It actually makes you look
like someone’s tugging you off under-
neath the lecture hall desks, but you
think it looks cool, so that’s fine.
But that’s just two people. You
know what they say about two - it’s
company, and this shit isn’t about
cuddling in front of the fire. Oh no.
We want a bloody group, don’t we? A
big manly group. So you need three
more people. This starts off pretty
simply, because you tend to just dis-
cover another pair like yours. There’s
usually something slightly off about
them at first, though. You know the
sort of situation - it’s like when some-
one you thought was normal intro-
duces you to someone they ‘knew at
secondary school’ and they look like
an axe-murderer who discovered Je-
sus, and then rediscovered axe-mur-
dering in the middle of a communion
session.
Problem is, it’s slim pickings be-
cause everyone else you know has
sodded off into a group of their own
by now, so you hire the crazy and cra-
zier two-pack. Four people. Now this
is looking good. This is what we’re
after; a big manly group. But there’s
a bit missing, we need five people!
Five is the manliest number possible.
And what does every man needs? He
needs a massive dick. So you go and
find one.
It’s not like you actively go search-
ing for one, it’s just that you find
yourself unable to lie about group
work. So when the most useless, feck-
less pile of skin shaped like a student
asks you if your group is full, you just
say no. Mostly, this is out of a desire
to just get the five people and start
work, but it’s also partly because you
know you’re going to end up with an
arsehole like him one way or another,
because all the good group members
have gone. It’s the Year Seven football
tournament all over again.
So you’ve assembled the Special
Needs X-Men. Congratulations. Now
it’s time to start work! Hey, I’ve got an
idea, why don’t we distribute the work
according to our relative strengths
and weaknesses, and conduct regular
meetings to review work and co-ordi-
nate our efforts! No? Okay, just pick
whatever you want to do and we’ll
meet again in eight weeks’ time.
Time passes. Wars are fought, com-
panies rise and fall, governments
strive tirelessly to improve the lives
of their citizens. You download the
latest episodes of Dexter and think
about buying an electric toothbrush.
It sounds like a good idea, but you
stop using it after it begins to make
noises like a cordless drill.
After a few weeks of ball-scratch-
ing you get down to work, complete
a few tasks and finally get ready to
meet your group. Hooray! Everyone’s
worked really hard in the last week or
two and you’ve got a lot of things to
put together.
Oh no wait, it’s all got to be done in
the next twelve hours. And a report.
That’s okay, though, because you’ve
given the report to the guy who’s “re-
ally good at writing”. He’s got an A
Level in Advanced Words or some-
thing. Cool, man, cool.
Eleven hours and fifty-eight min-
utes later, you finish picking out the
last of the misplaced full stops and
missing capital letters from his work,
and hit print. You shuffle it together
with the project work, put enough
staples into it to kill a rhinoceros, and
throw it in the general direction of
your tutor.
But it’s okay, you’re so often told,
the real working world is like this all
the time! Why is it like this? Because
the real working world was educated
in the same half-arsed, unguided
‘group work’ environment you were.
“you’ve assembled
the Special Needs
X-Men.
...Now it’s time to
start work!”
