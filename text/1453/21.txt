Valentine’s : Hot Date
Or Tacky Tradition?
Me and the gf are just going to settle down with a bottle of
wine and a film. Probably American Psycho.
Third Year
It could be great but I’m worried the rohypnol I ordered won’t
get here in time.
Second Year Medic
Who cares about Valentine’s Day? It’s Pancake Day on
Tuesday! I’d rather have pancakes than a girlfriend any day
of the week!

There are some phrases that crop up in everyone’s CV.
While you may think they sound good, employers have a
different way of reading them.
Resourceful: I steal pens from the office and, when no one’s
looking, the occasional swivel-chair.
Creative: I sit at my desk from 9 to 5, staring into space,
daydreaming...
Good Team Skills: I slavishly agree with whatever the guy in
charge says.
IT Literate: I spend more time on Facebook than I do
working.
I work well on my own: One day, I’ll go Postal and kill you
all. Could be in ten years’ time, could be tomorrow. Do you
feel lucky?
Presentation Skills: I don’t know what I’m talking about but
I do have an assortment of funny hats.
Sociable: I get drunk at the Christmas Party and expose
myself.
Years of Experience: I worked in the same job all my life and
then they cut me loose. I don’t really know what I’m doing
here.
Dependable: I don’t have a life so I’ll always be here. Forever.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
For some unknown reason, my boy-
friend decided to pick off all the
dried skin from his feet. What’s even
more of a mystery is that he decided
to leave it on my pillow. What could
be behind this strange behaviour?
A worried Valery
Dear Valery,
I suspect he gets some sick satisfac-
tion from picking his feet. It’s definitely
at the weird end of foot fetishism. He
should however make more of an effort
to conceal such strange habits in the
future. I suggest just going mental with
him about it. After all, no one wants to
go to sleep on skin-ridden pillow.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have recently bought a Hamster
and aptly named him Winston. He is
a frisky fellow and frequently humps
my girlfriend’s finger. This is harm-
less enough. What concerns me is
that she appears to enjoy it a bit too
much and I caught her feeding him
with boogies. Is bestiality behind
this?
Clifford
Dear Clifford,
Mmmmm this is unusual. I think you
need to be wary of such rodent competi-
tion. Just get a female Winston and the
problem should be eliminated. But I
think the real problem here is your psy-
chotic girlfriend.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I am worried about the coming Val-
entine’s Day as I have arranged a
“hot” date with some hunky Mech-
Eng guy. I am worried because the
last date I went on I found his jokes
so funny milk came out of my nose
whilst simultaneously farting. How
can I avoid such situations?
Pamela
Dear Pamela,
I suggest you start paying attention to
your sphincter muscles and avoid find-
ing anything hilarious. Hopefully this
won’t be necessary if he’s as boring as
every other guy on Mech-Eng.

Hamsters are so cute! I think I know
what Richard Gere saw in them now.
