How to play:
Insert these numbers into the grid above, from
left to right and top to bottom, in the shaded cells
(produced by solving the ‘Nonogram’). Then pro-
ceed as normal for a ‘Slitherlink’.
It’s quite simple, all numbered cells must be sur-
rounded with a corresponding number of edges.
There may only be one continuous line. Any cells
without a number can have any number of edges.
Well done to GLT who won the points for both of
last issue’s Slitherlink and Nonogram. Send your
solutions to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Nonolink?! 1,453
Someone gave our
Puzzle Commodore
too much sugar and
left him unattended.
Consequently he got
the Slitherlink and
Nonogram drunk and let
them into bed with one
another. They got carried
away and produced this
freakish offspring of a
puzzle.
If you can work out how
to solve it - get your
solutions to sudoku.
felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Solving and submitting
the Nonogram half only
is acceptable; points will
be awarded seperately.

With RAG Week a mere three weeks
away, we in the committee have been
working hard to arrange a wicked line-
up of events for you all.
But alas, even the great ICU RAG
committee needs your help this year!
We have yet to schedule any events
on the Monday and Tuesday of
RAG Week (that’s the 1st
and 2nd
of March), and we’re look-
ing for societies that would
like to run any kind of
fundraising event.
Whether you’d
like to put on a show, sell your wares,
or anything else you can think of, no
matter how crazy, we can help you
make it happen. Especially since it’s all
for charity, we can twist the Union’s
arm, so if there’s something you’ve
been dying to do for ages but haven’t
been able to, RAG can help! If your so-
ciety wants to take part, don’t hesitate
to email us at rag@imperial.ac.uk
So while Monday and Tuesday are
still up in the air, we have a plethora of
wonders already set up for you for the
rest of the week.
Wednesday sees the great annual
RAG Raid, where you’ll be decked out
in whatever costumes you can put to-
gether and roam the streets of London,
completing a list of tasks we’ll have set
out for you, all while collecting money
for charity, of course. Previous years
have seen people swimming in the
fountains at Trafalgar Square, serenad-
ing Swedish tourists and even streak-
ing through the Bank of England. So if
you want to terrorise the capital, stay
tuned, and we’ll have more informa-
tion for you soon. Prizes will be given
out for most tasks collected and most
money collected, amongst others.
On Saturday, we’ve got a football
tournament at Ethos. If you can find
a team of five to eight, drop us a line,
and we can sign you up for only £40.
We only have space for 16 teams, so
get your friends together and sign up
as soon as you can. There will be prizes
at stake!
So if you’re interested, email us at
rag@imperial.ac.uk!
