the Rector’s Cup had a short, but il-
lustrious history. Out of the 15 years
it ran, the Royal School of Mines won
the Rector’s Cup for 11 years of those
years and shared the trophy with the
City and Guilds for one of them. But
how was it that a Faculty which only
had 250 students at the time were able
to produce such great results in the
boxing? Here we have the recollections
of Jim Platt, a Mining Geology student
between 1957-1960.
“Though the RSM was numerically
B
lood, sweat and beers. If
there were ever three words
that would describe the
Rector’s Cup, they would
be it. Last week, we discov-
ered the wonder that was Morphy Day
and how it was a sporting and social
highlight for half a century. But what of
the other events? This week, we delve
into the sweet science that is boxing.
During the late 1940’s and early
1950’s, Imperial’s boxing club was at
it’s peak as Fred Carr, the IC Boxing
Club Captain in 1954 explains:
“In the past this college has had very
strong and good boxing teams, and
in the last few years it has constantly
been winners or runners-up in the
U.A.U. [University Athletic Unions]
Boxing Championships, and many
of our members have boxed for the
University.”
The strength of the Imperial Boxing
Club and the endless stream of cham-
pions seemed to stem from the grass
routes within the College itself. To-
wards the end of the second term, the
three faculty colleges would convene
upon the Union and watch the stu-
dents beat the living daylights out of
each other whilst enjoying a few kegs
of beer. All the while, the Rector of the
College would join in with them and
in fact present the eventual winning
club captain and the best boxer of the
evening, with a trophy, hence why the
event was called the Rector’s Cup.
From the felix archive, it seems that

at the foot of the totem pole it had
no impact on the RSM in the Rector’s
Cup, as we regularly took the tourna-
ment by storm. This feat of conquest
was achieved by us entering more con-
testants for the tournament than the
other two colleges combined were able
to muster. It was considered a matter
of duty for any ‘Mines’ man to declare
himself ready to box.”
And so the secret of the Miners suc-
cess is made evident, shear numbers,
although why the other two faculties
never figured this out is beyond me.
Or maybe, they did and they simply
chose to enter into a fight with a Min-
er... Although don’t let this fool you,
even though the Miners did have more
entrants than any other faculty, those
that they did enter were actually good.
The majority of the Imperial boxing
team were actually composed of Min-
ers, with Len Palmer winning the UAU
Feather-weight Championship two
years on the trot.
Setting aside the prowess of the
Imperial Club, what about the Rec-
tor’s Cup, was it a big deal. In 1955,
for the first time in the history of the
Rector’s Cup the tournament was held
under the auspices of the Amateur
Boxing Association who supplied the
officials, thus improving the quality
of the evening. Considering also that
the Rector actually attended the event
I would imagine so, and if Jim Platt’s
testimony is anything to
go by, it seems that the
rivalry was huge.
“ [I] was lucky to sur-
vive round one and end-
ed up being counted out in
round two when the referee
stopped the fight in my op-
ponent’s favour. I thought it would
be appropriate to make a protest to the
decision, but in truth I was glad that
the bout was over. The one good thing
was that I went down to a man from
Guilds, leaving me thankful for the
small mercy that an RCS man was not
in the opposite corner.”
Although the crowds that attended
were not in the same league as that of
Morphy Day, the rivalry was. But, al-
though it seemed that there was prom-
ise for this event to last the test of time,
it suddenly stopped in 1963, after there
was not enough committee members
to run the event, although the Boxing
Club continued for some years. The
event had died out, most likely due to
a combination of things; not enough
interest for people to enter, most likely
due to the Miners always having more
entrants than the other two faculties
combined. Or maybe it was the fact
that the only protection they received
in the ring were the gloves on their
hands, as we can clearly see from the
pictures that they didn’t wear any head
gear. Eventually, the Imperial Boxing
Club died out, again probably due to
the same reasons that the Rector’s Cup
died out.
40 years on and it seems that the
interest for boxing is back. Like the
phoenix rising from the ashes, IC Box-
ing has already become a big hit. Who
knows, maybe the Rector’s Cup will
make a comeback, although I’m not
sure how likely it will be for the Rector
to actually turn up.
