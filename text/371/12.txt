DON'T LET EM
DROP OFF PROF!
WHEN IT comes to deciding the most kindly group of students
at IC, one of the strongest contenders for any such acclaim must
be Elec. Eng. ft.
A typical example of their
benevolent thoughtfulness was
realised only in these past
two weeks.
They saw a need and acted
promptly, bringing a welcome
early cheer to IC lectures. The
fortunate victim of this kindly
act was none other than
Professor John fHitch-up-my-
trousers) Brown, the Head of
Department of Electrical
Engineering.
The need was observed
during the first seven weeks of
term and at last our hearts
(or sarcasm) convinced our
heads that it was time to act.
With Christmas approaching,
a quick whip-round was made
between two of our morning
lectures (when it was mis-
takenly hoped that everyone
was present), and the app-
ropriate Christmas present was
decided upon.
With the mission underway,
practical and tutorial sessions
were overruled, and on that
afternoon, a group of eight
noble Elec. Eng. stalwarts set
off from the JCR on the long
trek southwards to Harrods on
Brompton Road, armed with a
case full of Vip, 1 pand 2pcoins.
After nearly turning into Princes
Gardens we finally corrected
our bearings which took us on
a pleasant walk through the
news and around Brompton
Oratory and on to our des-
tination where our numbers
increased by one (on his way
to morning lectures ?!). A
quick and direct march to the
relevant shelf was followed by
a rather less speedy purchase.
An article of the desired
nature and price was chosen,
whereupon the already bemused
shop assistant (having heard
about our Professor's indis-
cretion) had to count the heap
of coppers laid one by one
before him. We left the
congregation of shop assistants
for the pipe cleaner section,
and then to the gilt wrapping
counter where we nearly
obtained a third gift for our
Professor, the gift wrapping
girl herself. Unfortunately we
did not have enough coppers
to afford the pink ribbon to tie
her up. Hence part one of the
operation was completed by
whisking the present back to
college and into one of the
lockers.
The next part of this epic
consisted of eighty bleary-eyed
students dragging themselves,
unaccustomedly early, out of
bed to make the following
Monday's 9.30 lecture on time
in order to witness the final
ceremony. Having been kept
waiting for some ten minutes,
an enquiry resulted in the
discovery that our efforts had,
for the time being, been in vain,
and by some quirk of the time-
table the lecture was now to be
on Tuesday. So, by a super-
humaneffort.wegotto Tuesday's
lecture at 9.30 and our
honoured Professor could evade
us no more.
Amidst a flurry of snap-
shots, he soon realised that a
neatly packed object awaited
him on the front desk. With
cries of 'Open it' ringing round
the lecture theatre he duly
obliged, and while the camera
men were busily working away,
he managed to tear his way
through the ribbons and paper
and reach the prised contents.
Raising the items good
humouredly to the chant of
'For He's a Jolly Good Fellow'
he came as near to blushing as
he ever will; but he always
maintained his dignity.
So a final message to all
future Electrical Engineering
students: remind Prof Brown
that it's 'Braces Before
Breakfast!'.
Yes, it was a pair of braces!
