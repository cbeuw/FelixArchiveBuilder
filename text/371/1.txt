MONDAY. 9th DECEMBER. 1974.
It's twenty-five years since we first went to press,
Our first College newspaper facing the test.
The critics were many; the helpers were few,
The usual procedure when something is new.
Great newspapers fall, it is strange to relate:
The Sketch and the Herald both met their sad fate.
But stout-hearted FELIX faced up to the fight,
His staff often working well into the night.
He suffered his critics both nasty and nice
And even found time to chase Union mice.
With banner unfurled, FELIX marches with time
Completely undaunted, and now in his prime.
I (R.B. Fletcher) The original FELIX as it
appeared on the first issue.
SO HERE it finally is:
the issue you have all
been waiting for (patiently
we hope). The production
of this Twenty-fifth Anni-
versary. Edition has been
characterised by an
unbelievable series of
problems and crises culmin-
ating in the postponement
of the publication date
till today.
Last Monday,the FELIX.
