is a ludicrous project and
shoirtd be scrapped is no
answer; sending hundreds of
people off to colleges may be
just as ludicrous. Obviously
there have to be priorities;:
just what those priorities are
is for the government to
decide. Though we must use
our democratic influence on
these governmental ideas of
relative importance, to suggest
that higher education in all
its forms should be given equal
weight is to lose sight of
reality: some things are
inherently more useful than
others, and, when there is a
shortage of finance generally,
priority must be given to them.
Just where do we hope the
world is going? There is a
world shortage of food, so
lets have more life-scientists,
lets go to Mars because that
would be interesting, lets do
this and that, but lets get our
priorities right. The grants
system may be unfair, but the
world is an unfair place; there
are larger unfairnesses which
should be righted first.

graduates. The only real
consequence of the meeting
was to make plain our own
impotence in handling the
situation.
Yes, I agree ICPGG should
join forces with all other
interested bodies to fight the
cutback but if PG's are so
utterly disinterested in their
own future as to be unable to
find the energy to voice dis-
satisfaction at being financially
squeezed out of existance, I
think we are wasting our time.
When the additional 6
%
cutback comes in the New
Year we shall all have asked
for it and I doubt if the rest of
the University will even notice
the gradual extinction of the
PG's anyway.
Yours Sincerly,

Dear Sir,
I am amazed that your
esteemed journal is prepared
to devote resources to pub-
lishing inane letters.
In these straightened times
it is suprising that your
correspondant (Felix 21st
November) is apparently only
concerned with the state of the
signs in the Beit Quad. These
flippant aspects are insig-
nificant considered in the
context of major issues such
as the grants campaign and
refectory prices.
It is significant that this
trivial letter should have
emanated from the RSM where
many students live in com-
parative opulence subsidised
by the racist South African
mining industry and are
sufficiently remote from the
impercunities of student life
to be concerned with non-
entities.
Yours sincerely,
Kevin Craddock.

Dear Editor,
A notice seen at Hull
University recently advertised
a meeting of students to be
held at 'Imperil College'.
'Imperil?'. A joke you
might think, but when I attended
the ICPGG meeting last
Thuursday I began to wond
Thursday I began to wonder.
Some 30 students turned up
from the 1600 odd PG's at IC.
The discussion centered around
the 2
% cutback in further
education spending as man-
ifested in the reduction of
demonstrating done by post-

Sir,
With regard to the ICWA
President's article in FELIX
22nd Nov. 1974,1'.see no reason
for women to be banned from
the Union Bar. However, I also
see no reason, or right, by
which a few women in IC
should demand that the average
IC student stop enjoying
himself. Surely the Union Bar
is the place where the student
who wants to drink may do so
Therefore, to stop him getting
pissed, drinking yards etc.,
would seem ludicrous.
Finally, drawing Miss
Dunning's attention to an
article by Kate McKinnon in
the same edition:
'The common outcry from girls
at IC is that they do not get a
fair deal, but how many are
guilty of looking more like men
mucking in with the lads and
walking along as if they had
just stepped down from a horse'
Might I suggest that the
women of IC get their tactics
for the war of the sexes sorted
out before they enter battle.
Yours,
M. Earle.

LEEDS -
NINE FORCED 10 RESIGN
I b y R i c h a r d W a r i n g
TWO WEEKS ago the Leed University Union council passed a
motion by 10 votes to 9, paragraphs of which read: 'The nation'
alist population of Northern Ireland is quite right to employ
physical force to defend itself against British troops and
sectarian assassination squads' and 'The Irish people have the
right to use any means they
wish, including the shooting
of British soldiers and police,
in order to try and drive British
Imperialism out of Ireland'.
Besides the nineteen who
voted seven council members
abstained and a furthe r seven
were absent.
Pete Gillard, a member of
International Socialists and
one of the proposers of the
amendment pointed out that
Leeds University Union had
already a definite Northern
Ireland policy having already
voted in 1972 in support of
the IRA.
Roger Seddon opposed the
motions. He said he was
convinced the motions did not
represent the feeling of the
student community and it was
wrong to support killings by the
IRA.
When the motion was made
public it caused furore among
Leed's students and a General
Meeting was called for the
following Tuesday to discuss
and ratify the motion.
Over 3,000 students
attended the UGM which
continued in a field after a
bomb threat. At this meeting
the original motion was
defeated overwhelmingly. A
motion calling for: opposition
to terrorists, a withdrawal of
trpups as soon as possible,
and the end of interment was
was passed in its stead.
Nine of the council members
who supported the motion, had
a motion of no confidence past
against them and were thus
forced to resign. The remaining
member who voted for the
motion, Dave Smith, was a
sabbatical officer and had an
expression of no confidence
passed against him (which in
effect gives him one more
chance).

Dear Sir,
In reply to the IF article in
the last issue of FELIX, I
should like to ask what gives
Miss McKinnon the right to set
herself up as judge and jury of
an entire college about which
she obviously knows very little.
<She believes herself and
the other women of IF are the
Cleopatras and Elizabeth Is of
the world (I should just like to
point out that Cleopatra for all
her great leadership, fell foul
of the typical female flaw of
dying for the love of a man, and
Elizabeth I died the Virgin
Queen — say no more!) and that
we of IC are guilty of bringing
ourselves nearer to a unisex
society.
All I can say is,well doneIC!
Has, I wonder, Miss McKinnon
any idea of the strength of
character needed by IC women
to carry out their causes against
opposition from their schools,
outside employers, and worse
still from the attitude of the
men of IC.
I admire every, and any
woman here who has tire will-
power to go through with
particularly a Mining or En-
gineering course. So we don't
all go around looking like
Paris models (did someone
mention a student grant?),
I feel we have more important
day, to day battles than whether
or not our make-up's patchy.
It is time we threw off the
shackles of a society that
dictates the shape of our
body, the colour of our hair
and eyes, our only assets
when voicing an opinion.
' Perhaps it does flatter the
ego to win an argument by
female charm and gain the
admiration of your male opp-
onent — but it is admiration of
the body, not the mind.
If at present the only way
to gain recognition is by
dressing more like a man, then
keep to your jeans. You are,
after all, as much a woman in
jeans as you are in a dress.
Yours faithfully,
Julia Dunning,-
ICWA President.

Dear Sir,
Don't let us ever hear that
communists believe in dem-
ocracy. After seeing Mary
Attenborough, an active member
of the Young Communist
League, removing from the
College Block Lower Refectory
every copy of a political
leaflet opposing the domination
by communists of the student
unions, I can only conclude
that for them democracy means
the freedom for them to go
about wrecking the country
and no freedom for the majority
of anti-communists to oppose
them.
Yours faithfully,
Anita Hamilton.
