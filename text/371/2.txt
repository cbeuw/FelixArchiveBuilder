TWENTY-FIVE years ago to the very day
(December 9th, 1949) the first FELIX appeared:
seven sheets of Roneo'd white foolscap held by
a single staple in the corner.
The original FELIX cat was a fully-
bewhiskered creature strolling along with his
hands behind his back sporting a Chesire grin.
That first edition of 600 copies sold out (it was
sold in those days, and it may come as a
suprise to some to learn that FELIX only went
free in October 1971) in about an hour and the
subsequent editions of 1,000 were equally
successful.
Many limes the Editor had his critics. Some
were men of words and little action while
others tried to be physically violent. However,
the editors, having catlike senses, somehow
managed to zap them where it hurts. These
battles were numerous and as varied in vigour
and style as one can imagine. Cats have nine
lives, this cat has not lost one yet!
I condemn the reprobates, on the Leeds
University council who passed the motions
condoning the terrorists activities of the IRA.
The student body should not tolerate such
irresponsible acts by anyone let alone its own
representatives. My faith in students' behaviour
as regards theirrationalandsocial responsibility
was restored on reading that 3,000 students
turned out at a Union meeting in Leeds to show
their disgust at the actions of the council
members. By passing a vote of no confidence
against these members and forcing them to
resign, Leeds' students have set an example
for students all over the world. Hurray! lor
Leeds* students and 'Beware student Leaders'
is the message.

It is rather by coincidence than design that
the present edition is coming out on exactly the
same day as the first, twenty-five years ago.
This is solely due to the fact that our
varitypist has been sick for two days thus
delaying this issue.
I hope you enjoy this 'Twenty-fifth
Anniversary' edition.

Sir,
Your reply to our letter last
week (More on Cross Country)
seems to suggest you have
entirely failed to grasp the
point of our complaint.
We accept that the Sports
Editor's position is semi-
autonomous and would not like
it any other way. We now know
about 'the appropriate channels
through which all sports reports
should go', and we now use
these channels.
Our point however, is that
these channels were not known
to us at the beginning of term,
so we reasoned that the best
idea was to give them to our
friendly sabbatical 'FELIX'
Editor with whom overall
responsibility for this pub-
lication rests. It did not seem
unreasonable that a sabbatical
Editor should have the time to
direct all the articles and
reports he receives to their
proper destinations; but alas
we were sadly mistaken.
We are sure that FELIX
does not take up so much of
your time that you cannot afford
a few moments to make the
journey across the Beit Quad
to drop a way>vard article in
the Union' letter rack. This
leaves us* wondering what you
do with your time and therefore
our money.

P.S. 'Complete indifference' is
not a cheap remark: we feel it
accurately reflects your
attitude. You might hold a
competition to find the most
witty synonym for 'executive
proceedures'.
P.P.S. Judging by the state of
many of the articles appearing
in FELIX we certainly would
be unwise to imply any
malicious intent on your part,
but may we enquire as to the
whereabouts of several words
and phrases missing from our
letter; in particular that part
where in we recorded your
remark that sports reports had
nothing to do with you. May we
suggest that a proof-reader
might be used to good effect.
(May I suggest that you come
round to the FELIX office so
that we can thrash out exactly
what you are hitching about.
As far as I can see, you are
peeved that some Cross-
country reports were not
printed towards the beginning
of term. I cannot see that this
necessarily warrants the above
snide remarks. I look forward
to meeting you).
Correspondence on this subject
is now closed.

Dear Sir,
Being a 'scientist' may be
no excuse for political or
social ignorance ("Letters Nov.
22); it is however every reason
not to form an opinion without
sufficient consideration; one
should not accept others'
opinions as one's own without
thought. Expecting students
and people outside education
to take a dislike to the dis-

cretionary grant system when
they probably don't even know
what it is, how it operates,
how much money in involved
or the alternative (if any), is
absurd. The present grants
system may be unfair, our
leaders may know it to be
unfair, but until it is shown
by reasoned argument that it
is unfair, little support for the
campaign can be expected
from students here, even less
from the tax-paying public.
Being 'engineers' also,
consideration must also be
given to the practical side of
matter; would one be prepared
to see a reduction in old-age
pensions, say, to give more
students full grants? Obviously
that is not the real choice,
yet the money has to come
from somewhere: from which
piggy-bank should it be taken?
Would we prefer to see less
building of primary schools,
less hospitals, less what?
