Morphy Day
Riz Shakir
THE THREE CCU presidents gathered in the middle of the
arena with loyal supporters looking on and ready to pounce. The
traditional pies were exchanged and moments later oar could be
seen hundreds of yards behind the RCS and RSM lines. A battle
then commenced between three Mihes men and one RCS man.
SMOKING CONCERT
Richard Waring
AS USUAL those brave enough to venture onto the Concert
Hall stage had to face barages of heckling from the audience
which, again as usual, contained a high proportion of Guildsmen
for an RCS event.
The show kicked off in high gear with a sketch from Maths II
'Professor Laithwaite, you are
charged with breaking Newton's
Third Law of Motion — how do
you plead guilty or very guilty'.
This was followed by the
Magic Roundabout Sketch which
won the barrel a couple of
years ago. Not as polished a
performance as before (witness
cardboard not real guitar for
Dylan). Next was the Guilds
sketch. I didn't catch the title
but it probably was something
like: 'Pooftahs (as fairies) in
vague Shakespearian terms also
using as many Shakespearian
titles as possible'. Though I
suppose Charlie Wrigley in
drag was some consolation.
Chemistry Seven (all one of
him) gave a commentary on a
test-match. How many in-
nuendoes did you spot? 1 lost
count but maybe it's my filthy
mind! Then there was the
stripper who was good.
After the interval there was
the drag artist, who wasn't
good. N' anyway afer ze
inerval I wash pished an' so
was the Bishop of South
Kensington who wash played
by John Downs as the guest
sketch for Mines. The following
sketch from Maths I was rarely
audible above some very
persistent heckling.
Somewhere along the line
I have neglected the Physics
II Cinderella sketch and the
inter CCU quiz sketch. Then
there was the RCS executive
sketch and finally the tube
station innuendofromChemistry
seven again. Then the stripper
appeared again for a final
reveal all with able assistance
from two other gentlemen.
Finally, Pete (where's my
y-fronts) Teague led RCS in a
Kangela which, for once, was
not drowned by the Boomalaka-r
after all, it was an RCS event.
Pity then in a way half the
barrel went to Guilds while the
other best sketch was judged
to be Maths II.
however, due to the over-
whelming odds this was short
lived and thus the oar was
acquired by the RSM.
Meanwhile the real battle
had begun in the foreground of
this almost unseen skirmish
and missiles of virtually
unaccountable types started
to fly across the air. Initially
launching a 'lightening' fast
attack C & G caught the RCS
and RSM ranks by surprise.
For a time it seemed that it
might be all over in a matter of
minutes but RSM and RCS
soldiers started to offer in-
creasing resistance.
At first they held their own
against the onslaught from
Guilds' forces, and then
(having regrouped behind the
I ines) they launched a concerted
counter attack. This caused
chaos in the Guilds' ranks and
the order among their troops,
broke down. This was followed
by a 'ding dong' battle; at one
point one side seemed to have
the upper hand but moments
later the opposition seemed
to be getting a strangle hold.
The order was restored
when the three CCU presidents
agreed to have a ceasefire.
Proceedings were brought to an
end with a 'fug of war' contest
which the RSM and RSC
commandants won conclusively.
Jenny Jones claimed a victory;
John Mortimer claimed a draw
and Pete Teague claimed a
victory, promptly adding that
the other two sides should do
the same.
