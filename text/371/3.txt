IN TRUE school tradition I was "volunteered* to write a few
words for FELIX this week. I hasten to add however, that even
at the risk of jeopardising a discretionarily awarded diploma I
would have refused had I not rather looked forward to an opp-
ortunity of expressing some of my views on the topics often raised
in student circles, and I hope,
the views of some of my
colleagues.
In spite of the tirades of
abuse we suffer (apart from
those poured upon us by the
foreign members of the staff
here!) from the socially con-
scious members of the
community, I have not yet
begun to feel guilty about my
lack of participation in
organised 'fun' and 'good
causes' — As for spending a
Sunday afternoon with my legs
tied up and chasing an in-
animate object — well, I can
think of better positions! Such
as bent over the garden, a paint
pot, or someone's wheelchair
for example.
I protest too — by staying at
home — against the move to
demand higher grants and an
end to means testing. Students
may have campaigned for and
obtained the right to vote at 18,
they should then be prepared to
take a responsible attitude
towards helping to finance
themselves from that age.
Looking to the future, it is us
who will be expected to
subsidise not only our own
little 'diddums' but someone
else's by means of increasingly
high taxes. The left-wing
members of the NUS, together
with those of the Trade Unions
and of the Labour party, have
already been largely res-
ponsible for eroding much of
the freedom of individuals in
this country — viz. the ban on
right-wing speakers of so-
called educational establish-
ments, besides the curbs on
initiative and incentive in the
field of employment, and an
inclination towards too. much
dependance on the 'Sfafe'.
Such people as the former
Lord Stansgate have con-
descendingly taken upon
themselves to try to deny
others the opportunities from
what they themselves have
have already benefitted.
VERONICA SHEREWOOD, an
auntie from Ashford in
Middlesex, is in the Department
of Geology and is studying in
her final year. She is the
President of the De La Beche
Club this year and also finds
time to be on the ICWA
Committee. This photo was
taken only after much
persuasion. Her reluctance is
illustrated by her subsequent
quote 'I feel a bit old for this
sort of thing'.
When asked what she likes
best, the reply came 'Spending
money and fur coals'. D.L.B.
Beware!

Whatever has happened to
that once familiar phrase,
'Well, it's a free country isn't
it?'.
To those not initiated in the
strange and wonderful in-
tricacies of IC (women to be
excluded from the bar, and
THAT rag-nag!). FELIX is
largely incomprehensible.
Newspeak, as predicted by
Orwell, reviewed recently by a
well known colour supplement
and, practised in FELIX, is
trying to indoctrinate us. Is
'The Theta Affaire' significant?
(Come round to see me some-
time and we can check it out-
Ed.) or is it just the nonsense
it appears? Wellsoc, Dransoc
and Gaysoc (the last very
doubtful) have been adopted
in the steps of Engsoc.
Apathetic (shudder) is the word
applied to anyone who does
not take part in barbarian
sports, such as chariot racing,
and narrow-minded to anyone
who does not enjoy primitive
noise forms, that is to say
discos.
Last week some people
here, staff as well as students,
were rather upset by the
suggestion that we would
eventually end up sharpening
the pencils and lying to the
wives of IC graduates. Well,
everyone has their price don't
they? Seriously though there
is no reason nowadays for
anyone to subscribe to such
generalisations. Contrary to
popular belief many of us are
here at IF to broaden our
horizons, via the perspectives
of France, Germany, Spain and
Russia. Secretarial subjects,
although important, are kept to
a minimum a very decisive
point in the college's favour.
There is another important
advantage in following a
bi-lingual secretarial course,,
the choice of country to which
to emigrate is not quite so
limited!
I expect though, that I shall
still be here to read Katie's
article in FELIX next week.
