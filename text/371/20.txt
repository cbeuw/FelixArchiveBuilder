FELIX SPORT
CROSS COUNTRY
November 23rd and another cross country match; this time the
QMC IV2, moved from January and bringing the rainy season with
it: there mud was mud a mud lot mud of mud mud. Sadly, because
of flooding, the course did not have its usual pair of vertical-
sided seven feet deep ditches, but still managed to contain
enough varieties of mud, field,
road (with and without mud),
and mud to keep everybody
happy (except possibly the
local farmer whose yield
of winter wheat was severly
reduced by some 200 pairs of
feet wandering twice across
his fields). The ditches having
been removed, the worst
impediment to progress was a
field of knee-deep mud which
brought all ordinary mortals
not equipped with snowshoes
or size 17 feet down to a crawl.
The first for IC to complete
this IV2 mile course was Steve
Mudlark Webb in 56th place,
followed not particularly
closely by Neil Boat at 106th
and then Dave Jones, Dave
Houlbrooke, Rich Harrington,
Wilf Welford (Mike had finished
earlier), and Alf Gamett who
had done something to irritate
St. Crispin. A more photogenic
version of Ian Ellis finished
at 176 employing an unexpected
sprint finish to beat Pad
Donnelly into 177th place.
Meanwhile, some twenty
miles away in London, Rob,
Pete, Paul and Mr. Isherwood
were still awaiting the coach
promised to bring them to the
course. Their absence was
enough to loosen our seemedly
assured grip on the John Banks
Trophy for the first UL college.
This was eventually won by a
slightly ineligible LSE team,
along with bottles of cider
and other worthwhile mem-
entoes.
Wednesday saw revenge in
the form of crushing defeats of
both LSE and Brunei over our
home course at Petersham.
Rob Allinson showed the flag
well in first place with Paul
Clarke (sans flag) second in
just over 30 min for the 5 1/3
mile course: Steve Webb and
the real T
an Ellis (not Bob
Ignaciuk ihis time) with some
of the opposition were next in
just under 31min. Other notable
performances were by Pete
Payne whose return from injury
was unfortunately not marked
by a time of 31min as promised
for his first run this season.
Among those with a hand in
the victory were Tim Davey,
J im Rushmer and Andy Fairhead,
and sundry others.
This Saturday last, we just
stole second place from the
Bank of England in a three-
cornered race with Hercules-
Wimbledon over Wimbledon
Common. This was all a
conspiracy to get us fit for the
UL Champs tomorrow (hint,
hint), the IV2 mile distance
having been concealed by
Steve Webb and Mick Fuller
who is said to have left the
country. Rob Allinson, who
was also in the know, finished
4th in 42 min 21 sec with a
less well-prepared Ian Ellis
10th in 45-13. Fourteenth was
Paul Clarke in 46-05 and 16th
and 18th were Roman Halenko
and Neil Boag in 46-37 and
46-53. The two Daves J & H,
Mike and Pete completed the
team in only slightly less
respectable times, and Pad
Donnelly and John Shearer were
left to dispute who was first
not to finish. The team result
was: H-W 79, IC 190 and B of E
196.
*There will be a Ladies
Cross Country Race over 2V2
miles at Reading University on
March 8th; anyone interested is
invited to contact us.
*UL Champs tomorrow,
Dec 7, at Parliament Hill, 2p.m.
start, everybody welcome.
Last Saturday saw the return
match against the Met. Police"
at Hayes where we fielded a
weakened team; Rob Allinson
was away, being first scorei
for UL at Birmingham, and
several others had gone home.
This allowed Steve Webb to be
our first home followed by Ian
Ellis and Paul Clarke. We also
had some other runners there
and were narrowly beaten by a
measly 80 points.
On Wednesday we had the
second London League race at
St. Marys, Twickers. Everyone
improved on their time for last
year's race with one notable
exception - D.Payne esq. who
dropped 6mins. 22sec. Pad has
his work cut out trying to race
a woman round from Barts.
Rob Allinson was first home
(again) in 7th place followed by
Steve Webb, Ian Ellis, Tony
Weir and many more runners of
great repute. After the race the
results were worked out in
several Youngs Pubs around
Teddington, Twickenham and
Richmond (R.Allinson is
league secretary) ICI are now
3rd in Div. 1, IC2 are top on
Div. 2 closely followed by IC3
who are 3rd. P.Donnelly and
Co (IC4) are now 14th. The
evening was rounded off by
several multicolour yawns.
Â«ocK>ry
After a two week enforced
lay off, the hockey club
returned to the battle field last
Wednesday. Inspired by their
pre-match pep talk IC leapt
onto the fieldfullofenthusiasm,
only to find that our opponents
had not turned up. After a very
long wait Barts arrived and
battle was joined. Fired with
energy under the captaincy of
Tim Hansen (all the way from
Putney), IC just had the better
of a fairly evenly balanced
first half. However, half-time
came with the scoreline still
0-0.
The second half was only
five minutes old when Kim
(whoops, there he goes again)
Houlden allowed his winger a
bits-too much room and Barts
scored. At this stage IC faced
an uphill struggle but Barts
began on a course of self-
destruction. They proceeded
to argue with everj umpiring
decision, argue with each
other and preferred to mess
about rather than play hockey.
Keeping their heads admirably
IC quickly gained control and
the goal rush started. Dave
Lord scored the first. This
was quickly followed by further
goals from Jeh 'Sleepy' Bashar,
Trevor 'Superstar' Tutu and
Ian Mclean (2). Barts did fluke
another goal, but IC ran out
easy 5-2 winners.
Although this was an
excellent team performance
special mention must go to
Trevor Tutu for a devastating
display at centreforward. The
Barts defence had great
difficulty in marking him,
particularly in the second half,
once darkness had begun to
fall.
Team: Roger Hutson; Jim
Marshall, Richard Cameron;
Kim Houlden, Keith Arrowsmith
Chris Hodge; Dave Lord, Ian
McLean, Trevor Tutu, John
Andrews (Capt), Jeh Bashar.
2nd XI
After a long respite, due to
the inclemency of the weather,
Harlington's pitch G again
suffered the onslaught of the
2nd eleven hockey sticks. Our
gullible opposition was the
National Physical Laboratory's
Nth team (where N is any
number between 2 and 5).Our
captain (Read I) had quite a
lot of difficulty selecting the
team as we were equiped with
five full backs, four wing
halves, two inside forwards
and a goal keeper but ev-
entually he managed to sort out
a more conventional formation,
by persuasion, argument and
force. He, himself, delegated
Reed E. to Umpire the second
half and decided to umpire the
first half himself. A wise move
as he was obviously still
suffering from the after effects
of Linstead Hall party.
After the usual, see how
many injuries you can inflict
on the goalkeeper before we
start session, play was com-
menced and IC went immediately
on to the offensive. Though
NPL looked dangerous on the
break IC always had the whip
hand with Chris parker dom-
inating midfield in the
unaccustomed position of
centre half, and it came as no
suprise when Pete Nowell
scored. NPL counter attacked
but John Huckle, Shane Mead
and the inscrutable Tan held
on well in defense and our
opponents were thwarted.
After a half time team
reshuffle the formation began
to look a bit saner and once
more IC dominated the match.
Pete Nowell completed his
well deserved 'Jug' at the much
maligned position of left wing,
after a series of goal-mouth
scrambles. At the other end of
the field IC conceded a short
corner from which NPL were
lucky to score a goal after the
ball had ricocheted off a
defender's stick over the
goal keeper's head and an
incoming forward was able to
knock the ball past the covering
full back. So the score at the
final whistle was 3-1 to IC.
The after-match festivities
were much enlivened by Read I
finally buying the jug which
he has owed since die first
match of the season. With Pete
and Bruno (yes, that is his
name) Speed still to provide us
with jugs, next week's fixture
should be memorable.
Team (first half positions):
N.Harrison, S.Mead. J.Huckle,
E.Reed, C.Parker, Y .Tan,
D.Balderstone, A.Cresswell,
P.Nair, N.Bell, P.Nowe'll.
Umpire: Read I.
