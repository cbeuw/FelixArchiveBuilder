WAS NEWTON WRONG?
"No!" Says the Prof
R i z S h a k i r
Electrical Engineering
department has presented us
with numerous surprises to
date and Professor Laithwaite
has certainly had as much of a
hand in these as any other
single man. His latest brain-
child, (a demonstration of
which had been given at the
Royal Institution a few weeks
ago), sounded fascinating in
more ways than one. A request
was put in by FELIX that it
be allowed to photograph the
machine and be given some
simple explanations. Professor
Laithwaite promptly obliged
and a demonstration was put
on for us on Thursday, 28th
November.
The twin gyroes were made
to spin by means of compressed
air, until the noise due to the
interaction of the compressed
air and the surface of the metal
became a shreak (speed of
gyro ca_ 1200 rpm). Professor
Laithwaite then lifted the
gyroscopes about six inches
and released them; the motor
(this makes the support of the
gyroscopes spin in a horizontal
direction) was switched on at
the same time.

As gyroscopes in turn ran
down the parabolic track, the
machine (see fig. 1 forposition)
started to lift. On reaching the
bottom of the track, the gyro-
scopes immediately returned to
their original position at the
top and subsequently ran down
the track. The upthrust thus
produced, although varied
considerably due to there being
only two gyroscopes, but was
undoubtably present. The
resultant motion was very jerky.
The explanation as to the
cause of this upthrust is given
by vector summation of the
various intermediate forces as
the gyroscopes undergo the
above mentioned cycle.
Considering a gyro which is
already at the top of the motion;
it is clear that as it goes down
the track it experiences both
action and reaction. However,
when it lifts from the lowest to
the highest point, there is
action but no reaction. Thus
vector summation gives us a
resultant upwards force, and
it is this force which produces
the lift.
The principle was dem-
onstrated much more con-
vincingly on a larger single
gyro (fig. 2). With the gyro not
spinning the manual handle was
used to make the gyro and arm
move in a horizontal circle,
then on placing one's hand in
the way of the arm one
experienced considerable
force. On the gyro being made
to spin it precessed at a
considerable rate, however if
one how placed one's hand in
the way of the precessing gyro,
'one experienced no force', all
one needed to do was take its
weight. In fact, the gyro just
approached . one's hand
instantaneously came to a
stop; dropped down and on
releasing immediately started
the precession with a 'constant
angular velocity'; in other
words there was 'no time of
acceleration or retardation'.
This implies that the gyro has
no angular momentum, this
however, is not possible,
therefore Professor Laithwaite
states that the momentum must
be imaginary, i.e. it has square
root of negative one in front
of it. Professor says it was
easier for him to realise this
because he is an electrical
engineer and therefore has
known of similar cases with
inductances, where one has to
introduce imaginary numbers
for some properties.
Above will seem not to be
in accordance with 'Newton's
Laws' and indeed this case is
not covered by them. However,
the Professor points out that
'Newtonian' consideration only
covers 'constant acceleration',
whereas this case involves rate
of change of acceleration.
Hence Professor Laithwaite
claims to have made an
extention to Newton's Laws and
not disproved any part of them
(reports in some scientific
journals that the Professor has
disproved these laws are false
and unfounded).
Professor was at pains to
explain that his machine does
not violate the 'Law of Con-
servation of Energy' and that
the energy is supplied by the
motor.
This machine has countless
possible applications, es-
pecially in space travel. I
think the whole college will
join me in wishing, Professor
Laithwaite, best of luck and
every success with this
machine and subsequent
research.
