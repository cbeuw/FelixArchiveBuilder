CONGRATULATIONS, 'FELIX' on 25 years of invaluable
service to the IC Union. May the RSM add to the many wishes for
the paper's continued success.
1949-1974 have been years of considerable change in our own
society and throughout the world. Every institution has responded
in its own way. The RSM has
expanded to meet the demand
for engineers, metallurgists
and geologists, brought about
by the significant growth of
our industry.
Proudly the RSM stands
ahead of the field in the
technical aspects of its dis-
ciplines, but tenaciously we
have held on to our traditions
and spirit. The loss of some
cohesion in the college'^
activities, remembered so welf
by RSMA members of that time,
was a necessary sacrifice to
the need for expansion.
Thankfully our small and
friendly atmosphere has
survived. At least ours is not
to become a giant and im-
personalised institution.
Looking back into our past
I found that during those
momentous days leading to the
creation of "FELIX* .the Mines
Union was locked in serioys
debate concerning the format
of their Freshers Dinner. 5/-
a head was the suggested
price and yards were 'naturally'
to be consumed in the bar
afterwards. The only con-
troversy was whether to have
three or four free firkins of
beer!
The capacity of Minesmen
to enjoy themselves was never
in question, so much so that
successive Presidents had to
warn the members of the
dangers of excessive festivities
on Guy Fawkes and Morphy
Day. 'The police', they were
warned, 'would take strict
action If there was any improper
behaviour on Morphy Day'.
The college assured them that
brawls on Bonfire night with
police and fire brigade would
result In the offenders being
'send down'. I'm told it was
traditional to try to set fire
to 'AlberfW-
1955 the Union bought, and
christened, the first
'Clementine', an immense 15
ton traction engine, as their
first mascot. Realising the
need for a violate mascot as
well, they also aquired 'Mitch'-
the only Michelin Man in the
world to wear mines colours
and a hard hat. Unfortunately,
he appears to have been
violated sometime between
then and now!
The first stage of expansion
took place in 1956. They lifted
the roof off the Mines building
and built a new floor on top
while the intrepid few con-
tinued their work beneath.
Unfortunately Clementine's
life was short but eventful. In
1959 her boilers were certified
as unsafe and she made her
last journey to that scrap yard
in the sky. The enthusiasts
were not to be deterred,
however, and soon they found a
worthy successor in the form
of our present 1926 Morris
Commercial Lorry. Not ones
to break with tradition,' the
Minesmen named herC/emenf/'ne.
By all accounts 1959 was a
humdinger year and not so
unlike the present day. Even
then • the President observed
that 'the RSMU had no home of
its own, only a small 'toilet-
sized' office", It wasn't the
same office, mind you, but we
are little better off in our
present orfice known as 'the
broom cupboard'.
Typical with their deep
sense of association with
South Africa the 1959 RSMU
debated and passed, 108 votes
to 14, the motion 'this Union,
whilst not condoning Apartheid
should dissociate itself from
IC Union in the matter of
boycotting South Africian
goods'. Even then people
sought to sever the RSM's
essential links with the most
experienced underground
mining industry in the world.
Expansion came again in
1966 when the new Link and
Spur buildings of the RSM were
opened. At that time, Gealogy
was a part of the RCS, a
disadvantage that they have
done well to overcome in the
last 8 years since their transfer
to the RSM. This important
step meant that in one building
and one college the RSM had
the technical facilities to
educate engineers (difficult
though it may be!) and carry
out research into the entire
mining industry from exploration
to the finished product. This, I
believe, is one supreme ad-
vantage of the RSM and one
reason for the strength' and
comradeship. which, once
developed in college, is so
easily carried over into the
industry.
Two new departments have
since served to increase the
scope of the RSM activities.
Material Science in 1970 and
Petroleum Engineering in
1974 must make us one of the
most broad based mining
colleges in the world.
For all we have changed
with the times, in the tech-
nological field, we have
maintained our social style
throughout these 25 years.

What has science brought us? For the vast majority of the
population only more drudgery and less skill in their work:
slavery to the machine. Is this a benefit? Shouldn't we revert
to a simpler existance where a man made for himself all he
needed?
O.K. So that's an extreme position, and not totally valid.
What I really mean is: have we let technology advance
uncontrolled in the wrong direction? We have never, in the
advanced western nations, had it so good materially, but are
"
w
e not now totally dependent on the technology we have
created; a technology that cannot adapt and is beginning to
make us pay for its use of dwindling resources and energy
reserves. A technology based on non-renewable fossil fuels—
the reserves of which are shrinking fast.
From this giant technological mushroom we have, of
course, gained considerable material advantage. We have
conquered many diseases, but have increased others: cancers,
and heart diseases. Most of the annual consumption of
resources is done by the advanced nations, whose citizens
chase the ever receding goal of increased living standards.
These humans, ourselves, are over supplied. We have great
choice — cheese from England or Switzerland, cars from
Japan or America, beer from Germany or Australia — un-
necessary and energy consuming transfers of goods all
sacrificed to the god of increased living standards. Meanwhile,
we allow half the population of earth to starve.
Many of our much vaunted new technologies serve to
create more waste which has to be disposed of somehow.
Perhaps the most horrible example of this is the new gen-
eration of fast breeder reactors which have been hailed as
a panacea to our energy problems. However, what do we do
with Plutonium waste — it is going to hang around for a very
long time and it's very toxic. The Panacea may prove to be
poi son.
I don't suggest that we should stop advancing. What I do
suggest is that we search for better ways to advance. There
has already been a great deal of talk about the environment,
but little action. If we continue in our current ways, failing
to face the problem, then within the next century at the out-
side there will be catastrophic results. It may be unpopular
to aay we must cut back — clean up — have a reduction in
living standards but it is a reality that must be faced. You
may believe humanity is destined to reach the stars, but
hadn't we better clear up our own little sphere first.

TWO IC STUDENTS were
arrested at 1a.m. on Thursday
at Gloucester Road Tube
Station after removing adverts
from a tube train. The two:
Erica Graham, RCSU treasurer,
and Steve Brightman, RCS
publicity officer, were taken
to a police station where they
were charged with breaking
Section 2 of the Theft Act,
1968, Later they were released
on £50 bail which they did not
pay. On appearing in court the
following morning at 11a.m.,
they pleaded guilty. Both were
discharged with £5 costs. Their
case took five minutes.
That at least has remained
unaffected by the decadence of
our age. But greater changes
are forecast. A recession is
widely predicted and overseas
mining is threatened by the
emergence of the new and
highly nationalistic nations.
Will the RSM graduate need to
be different to cope with this?
My guess is that he won't.
Instead of being Empire
builders (for what is a Empire
founded on if not on mineral
wealth), they will become
educators and consultants to
the developing nations and
diplomats in the politically
hot climates of Africa and
America. Above all the sense
of adventure, resourcefulness
and enthusiasm of Minesmen
will be in constant demand for
at least another 25 years.
To Minesmen I finish with
this plea:
Change and decay in all
around I see,
O thou, who changest not
abide with me.
