'Imperial College Dramatic Society' (hereinafter known as
Dramsoc or ICDA) was formed in 1912, unfortunately it wasn't
able to become active until 1918, and a year or so later was
united with 'The RCS Musical Society' to form 'The Imperial
College Musical and Dramatic Society' which put on its first full
length play,' School for Scandal'
(Sheridan), in Easter 1921.
Moving on to 1933 brings me
to the point of this pre-FELIX
ramble; for during this year the
stage crew got together to
reconstruct the stage into a
more solid and permanent
structure than that used before
and in the process spent every
last penny — in E.s.d.l — the
society possessed. Neverthe-
less Dramsoc continued
undaunted, occupying what is
at present the Union Office and
ICWA lounge, for at this time
the Union building was only
two floors in height. For the
next few years the musical
side of the society declined,
the electrics were condemned,
and in 1940 the society was
reinstated as ICDS. In 1945
the stage was again modified
and during the next few years
the society was brought into
full swing again.
In 1949 (at last!!!) Dramsoc
produced two plays: 'A Murder
Has Been Arranged' (Emlyn
Williams) from March 21st to
23rd and the Christmas show
(7th-10th December) 'Much
Ado About Nothing' (Shakes-
peare); chairs had to be
borrowed from the Royal Albert
Hall and tickets were about
six shillings (30 noddy pence-
which compares very well with
today's price of 40 pence).
With in ten years the society's
existence was again disturbed,
for the extension of the union
building, and a few productions
were held outside college.
However, in 1956 the new
building was opened and the
society occupied the new
Concert Hall, which contains
an extremely well equipped
stage (compared with some
West End theatres), dressing
rooms and a storeroom which
acts as headquarters of the
society. The first production
under the new. roof 'Loftur'
(Sigurjonsson) reputed to be the
first performance of the play
in English. The production was
in conjunction with the Comus
Players (who are I believe
currently in revival); the next
a double bill of 'Trial by Jury'
(Gilbert & Sullivan) and
'Sganarelle' (Moliere) was with
the Musical Society.
More recently technicians
have been continual ly modifying
and improving equipment and
the Society has put on such
plays as 'Arsenic and Old
Lace' (Kesselring), 'The
Taming of the Shrew' (Shakes-
peare), 'Under Milk Wood'
(Dylan Thomas) and more
recently 'Murder in the
Cathedral' (T.S. Eliot) pro-
duced in the Great Hall.
Last C h r i s t m a s we produced
'Camino Real' by Tennessee
Williams which was an awkward
play both technically and
artistically. Easter saw 'As
You Like It' (Shakespeare)
which was also taken on tour
last summer (see an earlier
FELIX). This term's is a
complete contrast — a double
bill of plays by Tom Stoppard
'The Real Inspector Hound'
and 'Albert's Bridge'. The
latter is originally a radio
play and both plays may be
described as comedies!
SPOT THE knobbliest
knees in College! The photo-
graph is one of Mr. Dave
Salisbury, Student Residence
Officer and a Physicist. Both
these qualifications, however,
are dimmed by his possession
of such knobbly knees, which
won him the title of Mr. ICWA
earlier in the term. Well
known around college, and
not the least for his wearing
of an immensely recognisable
purple velvet suit (with
matching bow tie), Dave has
already shown himself to be
an active member of ICWA.
Say no more!
Latest production of Dramatic Society,
