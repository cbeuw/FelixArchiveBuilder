'No, no it's not work, it's
FELIX'.
'We don't know anyone
called FELIX. Is it something
to do with that dried cat food?'.
'No, no, the college
newspaper'.
'Oh Can't I come?'.
'Well, it's not that sort of
occasion. Stag you know'.
'Humph Brahms and
Listz by 8 o'clock, I suppose'.
'Earlier if possible'.
Well, that's how it went.
We make our beds, and lie in
them. Which puts me in mind
of..... what the hell was her
name, the one with the tight
bun who went to St. Godrics.
All fire and brimstone, and

'Oh, just bashing out an
article forthe 25th anniversary..'
'Fool, we haven't been
married that long, and anyway

'No, no the anniversary of
FELIX'.
'I suppose that's more
important than talking to me.
You're always thumping away
at that bloody typewriter. It
would be nice if once, just
once, you could. '.
God! I'll say this for her,
she's a stayer. Never gives up.
What's-her-name was a stayer,
too. Was it Jane, or Julie, or
June. Or Jane and Julie in June.
Seventeen years does dim
the memory. Not for faces and
bodies and events, just
irrelevancies, like names,
work, and exams. Life at IC
on reflection seems to have
been one long round of social
abandon: carnivals, rags,
processions, fights, mixed
hockey, wine-tasting societies,
hops and balls; presidents of
the unions being kidnapped
and having their trousers
removed in public places.
Remember: Tony Hodgson
being smashed up in a climbing
accident; Mike Gorb, who
saved Tony, falling to his
death a few months later; Mike
Newson playing the clarinet
underneath Denis Leston
playing the piano both stoned
out of their minds; John
Sheldon's exquisite cooking;
Gil Street rebuilding a Volks-
wagen in his room surrounded
by empty milk bottles; John
Taylor's immortal entry in
Nelson's Column 'Will lan
Charles Robertson, please
collect his cutlery from the
refectory'; Frank, Sherry and
Ken; and when Ken met Carol;
and
'I'm off to bed', the wife
from the stairs. How dare she
interrupt.
'Good'.
'Charming. Well don't
expect to get into my bed
tonight'.
Big Deal!

THE SHEETS of FELIX have drifted silently down until they
form a consolidated deposit nearly a foot thick. The thin rec-
tangular lamellae, residue of the life of a myriad organisms, span
no fewer than twentyfive distinct Eons; each one indicated by
the unfailing recurrence of the Map of South Kensington. The
fine-structure, too, has its own
characteristically repetitive
patterns. Few will beunfamiliar
with reproductions of some of
those intricately varied forms,
such as those technically-
named Priscandal, Brytunrun,
Ugmeet, Sekscandal, Nusdem,
Entscandal or Cupism.
Stratigraphists have found
that the platelets are of a
remarkably constant area
(0.073 m ) throughout the first
eighteen Eons. This oc-phase
was probably a period of little
climatic change. In thep-phase
they are larger, but still
correlate well with the ass-
ociated financial deposits,
which appear as coloured bands
of faint pink or smudgy grey.
The <f-phase (twenty-second to
twenty-fifth Eons) has ex-
ceptionally large lamellae
(0.128 m ), and the finance
bands change dramatically to a
brilliant red. This colour
persists into the most recent
deposit, but the platelets
revert abruptly to the size of
the originaloc-phase. A detailed
explanation of these extra-
ordinary variations may prove
the key to the past and future
evolution of our planet.
Incredibly, there is con-
clusive evidence that the
FELIX sediments are by-
products of the activities of a
quasi-intelligent species which
is closely related to Man.
Priests of the cult of the Cat,
they toil tirelessly so that it
will produce 'news' and
'comment' for their adherents;
and these artifacts make up the
matrix of fossilised detritus
in the strata. Socio-
anthropologists are now sure
that there was a real founder-
high-priest called Howe, who
retired (repentantly?) to a
monastic order; and a real
founder-editor called Hughes,
whodisappeared inanenchanted
grove of the New Forest. The
folk-sagas tell of their
successors: the Presslords
Hargreaves and 'Curly' Kale;
'Killer' Kerrod (who instituted
a notorious order of female
acolytes in the temple of the
Cat); the warrior-editor
Bramley who roused the faithful
against the wicked birdmen of
Phoenix; and many others,
down to 'Verbalcontract'
Dowson and 'Publicity'
Williams. They are not the
imaginative creations of an
unknown Tolkien, but real if
shadowy figures in their own
arcane 'world.
Only the central problem of
the real nature of the Cat-
Oracle continues to baffle
science. What manner of beast
can keep on producing this
endless snowstorm of sense
and nonsense, triviality and
profoundity, information and
misinformation, cynicism,
idealism, benevolence and
malice? Is it a Power of
Darkness or a Child of Light?
Is it the creature of the Priest-
Editors, or has it enslaved its
keepers? Why does it never age
or mellow with time? Some say
it has acquired the pseudo-
immortality of a fundamental
particle, and could end only by
that chance encounter with an
anti-Felix from outer space
which would radiate its
substance across the universe.
Others that one day it will
fade quietly away, leaving the
feline grin behind. No one
knows: and while the world
wonders the sediment thickens.

premature obituary notice
preserved in Eon II).
