^Years of...
AS AN excuse to remind FELIX readers of Fencing Club's
recent spectacular achievements, such as winning our section of
the London League, being awarded the Links cup for being the
most improved club in college, having had a most enjoyable tour
of Paris last spring and having such notables as Julian Tyson,

IN 1949, at the age of 19, ICGC was already one of the oldest
gliding clubs in the country and had achieved quite a good re-
putation for itself. However, 1949, heralded a m'ajor and very
significant development in club history. It was the year we
bought our first two-seater glider. Up and until this time all our
pilot training had been done
by t h e 'solo method', i.e. you
were tied into the glider and
then t o w e d behind a car w h i l e
the instructor ran along s i d e
shouting encouragement and
instructions. With the advent
of the two-seater T21 'Daisey'
the instructor was able to f l y
with his pupil and hence
training was significantly
improved.
The club has thus continued
steadily, always trying t o
improve its fleet of aircraft and
encouraging as many students
as possible to be capable of
flying them. Basic training and
early solo flying are done
throughout the y e a r at our base
airfield at Lasham, near
Basingstoke. This s i t e offers
excellent facilities including a
club house, a bar, a TV room
and a bunkhouse accommodation
at 20p per n i g h t . For the more
advanced pilots we have
organised summer expeditions
to different parts of Europe,
and we have flown in Austria,
Germany, Italy, Spain, Swit-
zerland and Yugoslavia. This
year should see a C h r i s t m a s
expedition to Scotland and
summer expedition to France.
The club now operates
three single seater gliders all
of which are capable of either
local soaring or cross country
flights in excess of 180 miles.
Two of the fliders are also
equiped with oxygen for high
altitude flying and last year
saw our 'Dart' climbing to
over 17,000feet above Scotland.
The picture shown is quite
a typical example of a glider of
the late 1940's. At that time
flights of over 100 miles were
great achievements where as
today 300 miles is quite
possible and heights of over
40,000feet have been achieved.
The gliding club continues
to be very active and we
usually go en masse down to
the airfield at weekends,
preceded by meetings every
Thursday at 1745h in Aero
Eng 254 for lectures, films and
to arrange transport.
Although the price of
gliders has gone up from £800
in the case of Daisey to near
£4,000 for a Dart it is still
cheap to learn to fly with the
subsidy from the Union.
finalist in two weapons in the
British University Champion-
ships and Roman Gormez,
winner of the Lamington Spa
Open International and part-
icipant in the World Champ-
ionships, we decided to look
back at our achievements in
FELIX'S lifetime.
Paging through FELIX
backnumbers, ignoring Soccer
club moaning about having to
play barefoot on their tour of
Kenya, and the serious cross-
country club reports (not P A ' s
like what Pad and his mates
are), not to mention ideal
bicycle contests, 'Your Hop
Diary' and 'Nelson's Column',
we found, suprise, suprise — in
the spring of 1950 Fencing
club toured Paris. (The rather
vague account of what actually
happened seemed to indicate
that tours of Paris have not
changed much over the years).
The following years saw
varied activity, including
matches against such exotic
sides as the Cambridge Cut-
throats (drawn—not blood),
Salle Paul (lost) as well as
the usual university rivals such
as Kings and UC
But it was in 1955, the same
year as IC student, Frank
Irving, flew the first ever two
seater glider flight across the
English Channel, that IC
Fencing club, under Captain
Knill (now President of the
club) boast of their best season
for a long while, with an
unbeaten Sabre team.
But times .change. In 1956,
Victor Mooney becomes
catering manager. Vickers
donates Weeks hall. The
empire begins to crumble. And
Fencing club goes into a
decline.
Only the election of Kay
Nickelson to the post of
captain in 1970 saves the ciub.
(Causes much trouble, she
being the first ever female
captain of a A C C club. Her
pot in the union is untouched
as she is not allowed in the
union bar, and she opts out of
joining Stoats Club). The
arrival of Julian Tyson,
Lawrence Boyd and Steve
Thompson (remember the sheep
freak?) results in our winning
the B section of the London
League in 1972-73, and thanks
to their enthusiasm the club
once again gets off the ground
1973-74, another good year,
including a tour of Paris,
second in the whole London
League and numerous personal
and club achievements.
But 1974-75 promises to be
an even better year. Led by
our gallant captain Richard,
and having a record number of
enthusiastic beginners as well
as the talanted experienced
fencers, we should do well.
Already we have appeared on
STOIC — a very professional
performance from Julian with
Kay looking pretty, but not
being able to get in much of a
say. So an invitation to al
inactive fencers to join us
either in the Gym on
Wednesdays and Thursdays or
the Union Bar (?) on Friday
evenings.
Finally, it is only fitting,
now that we are once again
established to thank those who
supported the club in its
darker days, especially Akos
Moldovanyi, the Hungarian
professional who has taught
at the club for longer than he
probably cares to remember.
Many thanks to them for
keeping the club alive and
helping it to what will
most certainly be an enjoyable
and exciting future.
