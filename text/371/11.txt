THE EDITOR of this illustrious publication now in Anno
Felicis XXVI approached me with a view to extracting an article
from my think-tank. Naturally my subject was to be nostalgic or
at least about the life in a somewhat younger IC. Hence I decided
to write about Selkirk Hall and Beit Hostel, these being the only
college accommodation for
students in 1949.
Selkirk Hall to many
probably means that part of
Southside on the upper right
looking from Princes Gardens
but 25 years ago Selkirk Hall
was a house in Holland Park
number 50 to be specific. This
house was bought largely due
to the generosity of a Mr.
William Selkirk. He had spent
his life in a mining enviro-
ment and had grown quite
wealthy from his work. He
wished to establish some
mining scholarships and while
Mr. G.C.Lowry (the Secretary
of the college at the time) was
talking to him the subject of
residential accommodation was
brought up. As a result of this
Mr. Lowry persuaded him to
donate £17,000 to the Centenary
Appeal Fund, In view of this
the house was named Selkirk
Hall and Mr. Selkirk later had
an Hon. ARSM and FIC
bestowed on him.
The Wardens of the Halls
were Mr. Lowry 1945-51, Mr.
RSHG Thompson, Maths Dept,
1951-59 and lastly Mr. C.C.
Seaford (the Domestic Bursar)
1959-1961 when the house was
sold to Unilever for the sum of
£30,000 which was put to the
Sports Centre.
Selkirk Hall had five single
and five double rooms for
students, the warden lived on
the ground floor. A cook for the
fifteen students was employed
except for Saturday nights.
Students signed a book for
when they required a meal.
The fire escape system in
the Hall was rather rudi-
mentary and consisted of coils
of rope which students would
hang out of a window and climb
down. This very convenient
system was used only for late
late nights (or early mornings).
The Selkirk Hall tie in-
corporated a brick in its design.
This brick is due to some
students permanently acquiring
at least one from a building
site nearby. The brick was
presented to wardens wives
when they made a 'fause pas'
(or to those who are ignorant
'when they put their foot in it').
The tie has a gold brick
alternating with the College
crest on a dark blue background.
Beit Hostel, as it was first
called, had its orgins in a
pamphlet entitled 'Scheme for
the development of Residential
Hostels in connection with the
Union of the Imperial College
of Science and Technology
1924'. This pamphlet con-
sidered the lack of residential
accommodation in universities
and colleges to be an obstacle
to the social life of thecollege.
Even the UGC report of 3rd
Feb. 1921 acknowledged this
in Section 12 'Provision for
common lite and intercourse is
a condition of the highest value
in a University education'.
One wishes that they would
give the college some money
now to build Northside and
finish off Eastside so more
students can live in, but that
is present day not 25 years
ago.
The Hostel Committee of
the Governors decided to erect
a hostel 'between the western
end of the Union and the new
(at that time) Botany buildings'.
56 students were to be res-
ident with a weekly rent of 15
shillings. The building was to
cost £16,000 which came from
Union events. RCSA, RSMA
Old Centralians, UGC and Sir
Otto Beit who gave £10,000.
The Hostel was opened on
Tuesday April 26th, 1926 by
Lady Beit with 20 C&G, 15
RSM and 14 RCS inmates
accommodated in 52 study
bedrooms on seven floors.
In pamphlet in 1927 the
Hostel was judged to be a
success and considered that
more accommodation should be
available. There were two
schemes, one to add two floors
on to the Union building (which
at the time was only ground and
first floor), the other New Beit.
The former was abandoned (yet
again financial reasons) and
New Beit was erected.
New Beit was finished in
1931 and occupied the first,
second and third floors of the
building. The Union had some
rooms on the ground floor for
its use. The cost was £87,945
16s. 6d. In 1957 twenty five
extra study bedrooms were
installed on the third and
fourth floors.
Old Beit, when originally
put up, did not have any
kitchens as the Union building
provided meals for the inmates.
The kitchen on the third floor
was for staff and the fourth
floor a sick bay. New Beit had
a Senior Common Room on the
third floor and finance and
archives sections occupied the
present wardens flat. The sub-
wardens flat was the wardens
and before that the warden just
lived in whichever room he was
in at the time of appointment.
The second floor did not have
the present false ceiling and
the decor was a lovely dark
green and cream throughout the
building. Still on how the
building used to be, the present
lounge was the Union Book-
stall run by a Miss Larkcom,
the Bot/Zoo common room a
full-time snack bar, the small
security room used to lead
straight into what was the
middle Union office, even the
Rector had an office on the
second floor.
Students often used to be in
Beit for two years and some-
times three because they were
such an extrovert lot. Mr.
Irving remembers police were
outside Beit, (and therefore
targets for water bombs) which
led to a Superintendent and his
meanie men chasing the
students. The police were
turned out of Beit on the promise
that Mr. Irving would stop the
water. Just as he was speaking f
to a superintendent five gallons ^
were emptied on them! To quote
'He was a bit more difficult
then'.
The Hostel was mixed but
by floors rather than hap-
hazardly as now, which led to
one student climbing up QA
House to view the girls in the
floor above. He was sub-
sequently flung out!
If you turned up late at night
the front gates to the quad
were locked but a night watch-
man on the front of Botany
would let you in and one
emerged through into New Beit
just by the telephone kiosk.
Beit Quad in its present
form was laid out by Mike Neale
President of ICU in 1957, when
the hard tennis courts were
finally removed. Letters to
FELIX at the time, often
complained of the eyesore of
the rusty neeting around them.
Beit Hostel was run by Miss
Sherwood who was the Hostess
and she performed the duties of
housekeeper and more with
other College duties. Jahn
Owen would clean shoes for
6d., sponge and press suits for
1/6d. What more could one want
on a rent of a couple of quid
per week?
My thanks for help with this
affront to decent English must
go to Mrs. Pingree of Arcnives
and Mr. Frank Irving the
Warden of Beit.
