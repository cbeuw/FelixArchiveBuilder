RAG & DRAG
R o g e r W i l k i n s
USUALLY DRAG acts get right up my nose. However, to my
suprise, just as this one was creeping up my left nostril, I began
to enjoy it. This uncharacteristic pleasure I attribute almost
entirely to the presence of Mr. Roger Ruskin Spear. Apart from
having a very fine christian name, he has a humour which belongs
in the ranks of the pioneering
Python or the inimitable Goons.
Unfortunately, though, after
a good start, and an extremely
expressive guitar solo on a
3 necked-3 stringed instrument,
even Mr. Spear, while inter-
viewing the sweet young
aspirants to the title 'Drag
Queen 1974', resorted to the
standard kind of predictable
sexual innuendo gags that we
associate with the Miss World
fiasco.
Preceding the drag contest
was the rag contest; sadly
irrelevant this year following
the abandonment of the Rag
procession. Fiona Cassidy, of
Materials Science II, was the
winner, and a worthy one in
my humble opinion.
The honour of being drag
queen falls upon a person
calling herself Hula â€” a feller
from B & G Union whose real
name is something like Thach
Pham.
It is a great pity that IC
has no department of
psychology, as I would be
fascinated to find out why
people find it desirable to
temporarily opt out of their
normal sexual roles and adopt
not only the attire, but the
mannerisms of the opposite sex..
I end with a word of praise
for the organisers for the
really good quality/high level
sound they managed to put out
during the disco part of the
event.
