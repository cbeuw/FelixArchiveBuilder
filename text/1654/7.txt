Eurovision:

about Trump, but does care about
Eurovision

XX as you like, you can watch
black and white films with
French subtitles, but there is
not a single person on this
earth who when viewing the
Eurovision song contest doesn’t enjoy the
sheer ridiculousness of it. Every year, each
one of us remembers that Azerbaijan is a
country, that all the best pyrotechnics are
found in Europe, and wish that hopefully
one of the novelty countries like Australia
wins. Even with post-Brexit Britain, millions
of people will tune in, with many more ille-
gally streaming it on iPlayer because who
actually pays the license fee? It is an aged

them can write, let alone write
songs.
The vast array of European
entrants all send pop stars
with at least meddling level
of popularity in Europe, and
most of their songs embrace
the fact that the competition is
a little bit silly, that the songs
should be fun and joyful, as
evidenced by Sweden’s pas-
tiche of how to win Eurovision.
England does not embrace
this attitude and instead de-
cides to put its lot in with po-
faced misery and half-hearted
melodrama. You only have to
look at the fact that Engelbert
Humperdinck, a seller of over
150 millions records and a re-
nowned (I guess?) artist a few
year's ago. His song was a lan-
guishing, stolid piece of bore-
dom and he came second to
last. The thing England needs
to decide is whether or not it
actually wants to whole-heart-
edly try. If not, then stop wast-
ing the money, stop making

songs, and stop getting our
hopes up.
I
n the small town of Goldsboro, North
Carolina there lies a casual road sign
saying that it is a site of a “nuclear mis-
hap”. If that's not an understatement,
what the hell is? In 1961 a B52 bomb-
er carrying two nuclear bombs blew
up mid-air, dropping the nuclear payload
which came excruciatingly close to deto-
nating. The surprisingly long list of bare-
ly averted accidents involving nuclear
weapons has gained a new member. Last
week it was revealed that Britain's nuclear
deterrent experienced a catastrophic test
failure in which unarmed Trident missiles
were fired on the coast of Florida in the
summer of 2016 before being aborted.
Whilst they were unarmed, it does dispel
the idea of ‘smart weapons’ – the missiles
were targeted on West Africa instead of
North America, so were only off target by
a few thousand kilometres. Furthermore,
what is outrageous was the inexcusable
concealment of the important failed test re-
sults from MPs before parliament voted in
favour of a £100 billion multi-decade com-
mitment on the next generation of Trident.
Even the government’s excuse of secrecy
in the name of national security does not
hold weight considering that nations usual-
ly inform other nuclear powers, especial-
ly their rivals, before conducting nuclear
tests to prevent dangerous misunderstand-
ings. In 2012, the last time Britain conduct-
ed nuclear test, Russian ships monitored
and even congratulated the Royal Navy
after carrying out the successful tests.
However, perhaps most worrying is the
near-universal acceptance of the need
to expand the British nuclear arsenal
amongst the political elite. Gone are the
days of the 1980s when hundreds of thou-
sands around the world marched for nu-
clear disarmament, forcing right-wingers
like Nixon, Thatcher and Reagan and their
Soviet counterparts to commit to arms re-
duction treaties. Whilst it would be naive
to unilaterally disarm, what is worrying
is that the last ten years experienced the
slowest world wide reduction
of nuclear weapons since the
1970s – weapons which even
five-star general and US Sec-
retary of State Colin Powell
admitted to being unusable.
Today we no longer face an
ideological, antagonistic nu-
clear-armed state in the form
of the Soviet Union. The real
threat posed by Russia or Chi-
na in our globalised economy
is cyber-warfare targeting the
theft of intellectual property.
Trident ballistic missiles are
also useless against non-state
actors committing terrorism,
which instead requires coun-
ter insurgency. Should we not
spend our limited resources on
defence measures we actually
need rather than relics of the
cold war? Maybe the time has
finally come to pressure our
government to eliminate the
illusion that there is a wide-
spread consensus that we must
recommit to a new generation
of Trident. And perhaps the
time may come again that the
world truly begins the process
of universal disarmament.
tradition to listen to Graham Norton crea-
tively talk nonsense and use the most ab-
stract of mathematics to try and calculate
a way that the UK could ever finish on the
left of the leader board. Why is it, how-
ever, that every year Britain puts the least
amount of effort into selecting their act?
Every year the shadowy organisation
known as the BBC tries to put the least
amount of effort and expense into select-
ing a competitor which has brought us
such delights as Jade Ewen, Molly Smit-
ten-Downes, and the dream haunting
Scooch. Just in case you didn’t recognise
any of the previously mentioned names,
there is a reason for this: the UK doesn’t
send anyone famous. Indeed all the sing-
ers are talented at – well at the very least
technically, as it seems unlikely that any of
