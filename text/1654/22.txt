hose who want to live,
let them fight, and those
who do not want to
fight in this world of
eternal struggle do not
deserve to live.” I can’t
remember what great leader is
responsible for that quote, but it
is a quote that I have held in my
heart for the whole of this week. I
am not a homosexual, but I am not
ashamed to say that I shed a few
tears when that orange saviour
placed his tiny hands on the bible
and the liberals started to weep.
There were no alternative facts in
sight on that most magnificent of
days: the gays, the abortionists,
the vagina-havers, the Latinos,
and the Blacks will finally suffer
their due. Too long have they
experienced the leniency of
Barack HUSSEIN Obama and
his administration. FInally we will
feel the fist of power. A strong,
powerful fist will penetrate right
into the hole that the democrats
have left, reaching around to try
and grab at the stragglers that
have previously been inside this
hole. Trump is that fist.
Of course whenever someone
that the liberal contingent dislikes
is democratically elected, it means
that they will line the streets and
play some African drums, eat
some kelp bullshit, and cry. No
one on the right did anything
like this when Barack HUSSEIN
Obama was re-elected. Sure we
made a few signs where Obama
was an African witch doctor, and
were convinced that he was born
in Kenya, but we did it in small
groups. I don’t get why the women
and the minorities feel like they
have to disrupt to such scale. Don’t
they have abortions they need to
get to? With that said, however,
I did attend the protest. Not to
actually protest, but with binocu-
lars from a rooftop bar so that I
could see the proletariat weep as
they realised that it would not be
another four years of hand-outs.
There is nothing sweeter than the
tears of butt-hurt liberals – if they
could find a way to milk them for
their essence and bottle it, I would
buy a gallon every day.
I can’t wait for this wall either.
Finally being able to stop the
Mexicans from entering the rear of
America is the first step to making
it great, but why stop there? We
should be building walls around
everything – if you build a wall
around abortion clinics, whores
will no longer be able to have a
get out of jail free card. Build a
wall around Mosques and then no
terrorism related incidents will ever
happen again. Build walls around
Hillary and she can finally be
imprisoned for being technologi-
cally incompetent. WALLS WALLS
WALLS WALLS.
O
bviously
something
happened last
week on Friday,
but of course if
something bad
happens, the best thing to do is just
ignore it and hope that it resolves
itself. I take the same approach
to medicine – instead of putting
unnatural additives onto my body,
I just hope that lotus flower extract
rubbed onto my genitals will
arrange the tai chi of the infection
and leave my penis un-rotting. It
may take a few more flowers, but I
think that little Jon is getting there.
Anyway as I was saying, abso-
lutely nothing happened last week,
specifically at 5pm Greenwich
Mean Time. In other news they
announced the Oscar nominations
– unfortunately my own black and
white film which is three hours of
a camera zooming into my own
asshole didn’t get nominated. Not
even for best hair and makeup
in a motion picture. I mean mon-
keys can get that award. I liked
Los Angeles Los Angeles Land,
especially the joke about George
Michael’s passing, but I can’t help
but feel that maybe there should
have been more than one black
person in a film about jazz. Also
there should have been more use
of the sitar – If they plan on doing
a sequel, I just want to shout out to
Ryan that I’m in perpetual state of
unemployment/writing my novel
and would happily appear on the
film for a fee.
Of course you all know what
event didn’t actually happen.
Something happened in America.
Just between Maryland and Vir-
ginia. I don’t think we need to talk
about it though. I mean what else
happened this week? Well there
were all those Women’s Marches
around the world for no particular
reason. Even though I am not a
woman, I decided to make myself
the centre of attention at this
parade and lead chants and tweet
angrily when people made body
shaming signs about Trump’s tiny
penis and hands. Fuck I mentioned
it. Trump. OK FINE. DEATH TO
THE WEST. COMMUNISM MUST
RISE AGAIN. THE HAMMER AND
SICKLE WILL SLIT THE ORANGE
THROAT OF THE WOMAN-OP-
PRESSOR. I watched the entire
inauguration in some sort of
state of self-harm whilst sobbing
violently into my favourite block
of tofu. I later masturbated at the
photoshopped picture I made of
Hillary spending her first day in
the White House, spending millions
on Native American heritage, and
renewable energy programmes. It
was the saddest but the best thing
that happened to me last week.
If we ignore all the
bad things that are
happening then they’ll
just go away
Jonathan Masters has much
better things to talk about than
what happened last Friday
If we can’t actually
imprison them, we
can just build a wall
around them
Monathan Jasters is finding the
tears of the liberals a pleasant
addition to his week
