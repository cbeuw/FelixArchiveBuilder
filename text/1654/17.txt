Saad Ahmed gives the dirt on why Pokémon GO isn’t fun and was doomed to fail
\\ A lot of features
from the original
games are absent in
GO \\
to keep us going. We never
felt any connection to our
Pokémon. In the Pokémon
games, we could pick certain
Pokémon, battle with them,
and raise them. In GO, it
became just about catching
them and discarding them for
more candies.
Battling is a big part of
Pokémon; the competitive
battling scene is really strong
and can be as complex as
chess. In Pokémon GO, gyms
are the only place you can
A
h, Pokémon
GO. What it
was and what
it could have
been. It was a
sensation that
gripped so many people only
to come crashing down.
Let’s think back to early
2016 when Pokémon GO was
just an innovating idea. One
that got people excited. It
was touted to be an AR game
which would essentially be
the closest thing to Pokémon
in real life. Given the popu-
larity of the original games
and how many people have
watched the anime over the
years, it was something many
of us were really looking
people in other countries
hack their phones to play it.
The app isn’t exactly like a
Pokémon game and has its
own mechanics. You basically
walk around, looking for
Pokémon and have to catch
as many as possible. To
evolve them, you need to
catch more of the same rather
than battle. So the game gets
one of the great things about
Pokémon right, the catching
aspect. Wanting to catch all
the Pokémon and evolve the
ones you have gets everyone
in a frenzy to walk down
every possible street and try
and see how many critters
they can catch.
Unfortunately, there is
nothing more to Pokémon
GO. That’s it. If you aren’t
willing or able to go on two
hour walks around pokéstop
populated areas, the game
basically becomes unplay-
able. This is because it’s the
only way to get pokéballs
and it is the only way to
get health recovery items
which you need to level up
or fight at gyms. Also, a lot
of features from the original
games are absent in GO. You
can’t form a good team and
have strategised battles, you
can’t battle gyms and collect
badges, there’s no story to
indicate progression, and you
can’t even battle or trade with
other people.
These are all crucial ele-
ments that made the original
Pokémon games so popular.
Though there was hope that
Niantic would expand on
the GO concept and add on
some of the missing elements,
it didn’t, and without them
the novelty of Pokémon GO
wears out fast. There weren’t
really any rewards or stories
battle your Pokémon against
those of other players. The
battles are just about tapping
the screen, which spams your
basic attack, until you build
up enough charge to hold
down on the screen to charge
up an advanced attack that
does more damage and
pauses the battle to play a
cut scene. This mechanic is
dull, infrequent, and does not
compare to the more intense
and strategic battling of the
Nintendo games.
The novelty of Pokémon
is catching them, but GO’s
mechanism manages to
muddle that up. In the original
games, catching them all is
very possible, provided you
put in the time and effort.
You also need to battle
Pokémon before you catch
them which makes the act of
catching more intense and
more satisfying. In GO, all
you do is throw pokéballs,
taking away some of the
appeal. Also, only certain
Pokémon are common, the
rest vary between rare and
non-existent. You need to go
to all sorts of areas and really
push yourself just to complete
a fraction of the Pokédex and
get your beloved Charizard..
If you “gotta catch em all” but
you actually physically can’t,
what’s the point?
And now? Well, Pokémon
GO is dead now. It didn’t
go down overnight, it was
more of a gradual decline as
The ballad of Pokémon GO
people started to get bored
and realize there really
wasn’t anything left to do.
Even the rivalry between the
three factions couldn’t keep
it going. The rivalry was
really just people insulting
each other on the internet.
And sure, updates might be
coming out soon introducing
new Pokémon and features
but honestly, it’s too little too
late.
It’s a real shame, Pokémon
GO could have become
something really special.
Unfortunately it jettisoned a
lot of what made Pokémon
special with the end result
being a mediocre game
which was constantly plagued
with server issues. Maybe
in the future it will make a
resurgence and regain its lost
glory, but until then, I’ll play
Pokémon Moon.
\\ There weren’t
really any rewards
or stories to keep us
going \\
forward to.
Skip ahead to July:
Pokémon GO is released and
is an instant hit. It becomes
the most downloaded app
game; even people who have
never had anything to do
with Pokémon start playing
it. It gets to the point where
