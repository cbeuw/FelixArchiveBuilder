Avocado for breakfast? So #2k16
Firedog is on a mission to revamp
the hipster breakfast, causing
panic amongst avocado growers
worldwide. Enter a morning realm of
grilled halloumi, Sujuk and Lor.
M
ezze.
A word
meaning a
selection
of small
appetizers.
And a word that I have
recently started noticing
following a sharing plates
trend that has finally hit the
London food scene. After
some hearty meals, I have
adjusted my taste buds (and
stomach) to this wonderful
dining culture home to
Turkey, Greece and the
Middle East.
For me, the beauty of
mezze is to watch the dishes
on the table grow into a
party of flavours, textures
and colours. Not only that,
but the hours of cheerful,
relaxed socializing and
drinks that come with it.
Last week, an invite landed
in my inbox from Firedog
to try their breakfast mezze
menu. Firedog is a new
Aegean inspired restaurant
near Tottenham Court Road,
boasting of their unique
menu of dishes influenced
by Greek and Turkish
culture, and their mission of
reinvigorating the morning
dining scene with their ‘no
avocado’ policy.
I’m always up for trying all
the new restaurants popping
up in London, but waking up
to a feast of these delicious
small plates? YES, please!
(They did say to eat break-
fast like a king.)
So one bright, sunny
morning a few days later,
I hopped along the quiet
Newman Street to Firedog.
Pushing open the dark,
wooden doors, I was lead to
a surprise – bassy, electronic
music, a bar, and their logo
in bright neon lights in pink,
blue and red on the wall. I
instantly fell in love with their
unique vibes.
The waiters were just laying
the table with the mezze
dishes as I walked further
into the restaurant. Just
seeing the tiny terracotta
plates and tiles was enough
to get my adrenaline rush-
ing. Even the slab of butter
had its own mini tile. I was
not the only one – the whole
room was filled with gasps
and sparkling eyes set on the
tables.
5-minutes later we were all
seated and excited to start.
Our eyes were bombarded
with the burst of colours, the
variety of food and textures:
Aegean olives, grilled
halloumi, freshly made Lor
(a soft, Turkish curd cheese),
Sujuk (a dry, spicy sausage),
tomatoes with purple basil,
cucumber with specks of
poppy seeds, clotted cream
with honeycomb… and of
course, a bowl of flatbreads
to share and to mop up the
tahini.
The spread was an adven-
ture for my taste buds,
from my normal western
flavours to a hit of spices,
ingredients, and flavours.
The tomatoes and cucumber
were refreshing, balancing
out the cheeses and Sujuk.
My favourite was their house
chilli eggs, that is, scrambled
eggs with harissa – it was
a delicious change from my
usual scrambled eggs on
toast.
And when we thought we’d
eaten enough to ditch our
lunch boxes and cancel our
dinner dates, we were also
flavours in the form of staple
brunch dishes.
The baked eggs came with
herb yoghurt, chilli oil, the
sweetness from the charred
peppers and the strong,
enticing smoky flavours from
the smoked tomatoes.
The Sujuk hash starred
chunks of the sausage itself,
combined with sweet roasted
onions, spinach, potatoes,
and a runny poached egg
on top.
The Ozdemir Pasha II was
like a mini mezze selection
on a plate, featuring grilled
halloumi, the tasty smoked
tomatoes, fried eggs, and a
beetroot hummus that was a
beautiful purple colour.
What’s a breakfast menu
with a sweet option? How
about a jaw-dropping pres-
entation of toasted brioche,
juicy chargrilled plums,
kaymak (clotted cream),
pistachios and honey? I’d
happily replace my French
toast with this lighter, yet
equally indulgent and
eggless version.
It’s customary in the Med-
iterranean and the Middle
East to not let your guests
Christy Lam
introduced to the four all-day
breakfast dishes, an option
for those who (sadly) can’t
fit the breakfast mezze. The
plates were again a burst
of colour, offering a taste
of Aegean ingredients and
leave without a 3-month
food baby – and neither did
Firedog. This breakfast was
indeed a creative, contem-
porary and delicious twist
on the traditional Aegean
recipes for anyone who’s
tired of their boring crushed
avocado on sourdough!
