Protest or
stop
complaining
Indira Mallik sees protests as the
only way to exact change
A
s part of the
W o m e n ’ s
March millions
of people took
to the streets
across the
world on Saturday; it was a
galore of pink home-knitted
“pussy hats” and witty signs,
but did it mean anything? Will
it lead to change?
In a liberal democracy, polit-
ical dissent by citizens can
take the form of writing letters,
lobbying, or voting represent-
atives out at the ballot box.
These act through intermedi-
aries. Direct action – boycotts,
demonstrations and strikes cir-
cumvent these. Street protests
are a way of physically mani-
festing a group’s opposition to
an idea – letters can be thrown
out, elections come around
every four years or so, but
large groups of people shut-
ting down streets in response to
Real change
comes from
real action
Giacomo Boscaini-Gilroy is
dismissive of Saturday's protests
an issue are harder to ignore.
O
h, you went on Satur-
day’s march? You must
have the moral high
ground now. You 100%
changed the world by
walking around with a
sign. Here’s a reality check: the only way
to influence the nation is through gov-
ernment. You didn’t make any tangible
change, you sent a letter of complaint: 'Hi,
I think you are meanies and this is how an-
gry I’m going to get if you continue.’ How
often does a head of state listen to a pro-
test?

It’s not always about the
instant gratification of legisla-
tive change. After all, doctors
protested for months last year
to little avail, student fees
were raised despite protest,
and troops were deployed to
Iraq despite protest; however,
a slow attrition of opposition
can eventually lead to a sea of change.
Women’s suffrage was achieved by pro-
tests, and protests advanced civil rights for
ethnic minorities, addressed AIDS funding,
and led to the overthrowing of autocracies
in favour of democratic elections. Suc-
cessful campaigns of change are built on
sustained organised dissent, but they rely
on the spark of protest on the streets to
bring the issues into focus. Demonstrations
ensure that those in power know that their
problems won’t be going away. It’s no coin-
cidence that the first thing on a despotic
agenda is to limit the rights of people to
peacefully assemble.
“White moderates”, wrote Martin Luther
King Jr, were the greatest hurdle to the
black Americans’ goal of equal rights. His
words are just as applicable to other types
of moderates – the kind of person who is
“more devoted to the absence of tension
than to the presence of justice”. Some of
those who railed against the Women’s
Marches agree with the need for equality,
but question the “methods of direct action”.
Dr King writes that these are the people
who believe they “can set the timetable
for another man’s freedom”, ’allies’ who
preach waiting “for a more convenient
season.”
There will of course never be a ‘conven-
ient season’ for any sort of protester – any
public show of opposition is bound to bring
tension and disrupt traffic. Likewise, single
protests cannot solve all the world’s prob-
lems. A protest about equal pay in the UK
is unlikely to do much for oppression in
Saudi Arabia, but that doesn’t mean it’s
worthless; there isn’t some pot of equality
that will run out. If you disagree with the
ideals that those in power broadcast, it’s
not enough to stay at home and voice that
disagreement in private or via Facebook
likes. It behoves you to turn up and keep
turning up – to write letters, make calls,
and to vote (even in the boring elections);
to be visible in your dissent.
Let’s be honest, people go on demonstra-
tions for their own self-indulgence. It gives
them a good feeling when they see others
who think the way they do. It gives them
confidence and hope in a world of hate.
So it’s a shame that it doesn’t make any
difference in the real world, and they’re
helping themselves rather than others.
Chanting ‘Fuck Tory Scum’ is preaching
to the preached. Everyone there knew that
already. But what do you think Theresa
May’s thoughts on your choice of wording
are? FOX News viewers and Daily Mail
readers are those who you should really
be communicating yourself to, but you’re
not going to get through to them that way.
I got proper fired up by the Brexit protests
on 24th
June and in the days after. It makes
me seethe. If you cared so much about stay-
ing in the EU, why didn’t you do anything
when, say, it actually mattered? Do you
really think going for a stroll because your
mate asked you will change something?
I’ll grant you that in isolated
cases, protest itself can make
change. UCL’s rent strike was
influential because it affected
the university’s income, and
they can’t ignore a lack of
funds. But if you do nothing
more substantial than going
on a march and you think the
work is done, you’re wrong.
So what more do I suggest
that people do? Get out there
and prompt others to develop
their views. Start controversial
conversations with people you
know, friends, family, stand
on a soapbox at Speakers’
Corner. Ask questions to tackle
issues like consent and the pros
and cons of tuition fees. Discus-
sion is key. There are also ways
to make your voice heard in the
media or in the political sphere.
Join a political party and be
involved in its policy-making.
I’m not perfect but I went to
the EU parliament in Brussels to
present a petition to save Eras-
mus in Britain. I also wrote to
my MP to show my distaste at
Theresa May’s treatment of our
international students when
she was Home Secretary. Let’s
have real change, and that
comes through real action.
So you went
to the march.
What's next?
Madeleine Webb discusses how to stay
politically engaged now that the world
has exploded
P
rotesting was the
easy bit. Sorry to
break it to you, but
the Women’s March
was not the finale,
it was the opening
number, and the rest of the
show is no fun at all. I hate to
ruin the mood because I was
there on Saturday so I under-
stand how intoxicating it can
be – screaming “I’m mad as
hell and I’m not going to take
it anymore” is satisfying, but
it doesn’t actually change an-
ything. It’s important to rec-
ognise that the fight is only
starting because you can’t win
fights you aren’t in. So what
can we do?
Helpfully, the Women’s
March London has launched
10 Actions in 100 Days, pro-
viding a list of ten things we
can all do to channel our
post-march energy. The first
step is writing to your local
MP or Theresa May herself, to
encourage her to reaffirm the
UK’s commitment to human
rights when she meets with
Donald Trump. There is even

that the fight is only starting

an email template for you to
use on their website. Easy.
Stay Informed
Don’t get your news from
Facebook or Twitter. Please.
One of the biggest stories
of 2016 was the ridiculous
amount of fake news flying
around social media and
people not fact checking the
stuff they retweet. And yes, the
leading political commentators
probably won’t be sharing sto-
ries about Hillary Clinton being
a murderer/paedophile/ lizard
person, but a little thing called
confirmation bias means even
if you’re following the 'honest'
people, you’ll only be get-
ting the side of the story you
already agree with. Odds are
if your sources are websites
like True Conservative News
or The Liberal Review, you’re in
a bubble of facts some people
may consider to be 'alterna-
tive'. Reliable sources are the
safest way to not become
'that friend' on Facebook
who constantly posts political
garbage. Sticking to BBC,
C-SPAN, and the fact-based
sources should do the trick.
Donate
You’re a student, you don’t
have any money, and I get it.
However, even the smallest
donations can make an impact,
especially since governments
both at home and in America
are cutting funding to non-
profit organisations; it’s time
to put your money where your
mouth is. However, charitable
organisations don’t always
want your money. Healthcare
clinics need escorting staff for
patient safety, homeless kitch-
ens often need volunteers, and
refugee charities take clothing
donations for those who have
lost everything. Also, research
the charities your giving to,
as some are more effective
than others at bringing about
change in the world. If you’re
specifically looking for feminist
causes close to home post-
march, Reclaim the Night,
Rosa, and The Feminist Library
are all great projects based in
London.

about your own
biases is also

mad as hell and

Call people out (including
yourself)
A lot of the institutionalised
discrimination in the world
is cultural; the way different
groups are represented (or not
represented at all) in the media
and wider society reinforces
stereotypes and cultivates igno-
rance. And although it feels
like the world is full of it, calling
out bullshit when you see it can
actually help. Trump’s election
doesn’t mean sexual assault
is a joke –if you know people
who think that it’s 'locker-room'
talk, correct them. Thoroughly. I
know it’s awkward and terrible
but laughing with them isn’t a
solution. As for less gross polit-
ical disagreements, calmly and
respectfully talking about why
someone may be misinformed
or why you disagree can be
productive. Most people will
respond thoughtfully even if
they don’t change their minds.
Being honest about your own
biases is also key; you are
not excluded from this step.
For example, the Women’s
March was hailed (rightly so)
as a show of political force for
women globally and for men
who support gender equality.
But this doesn’t remove the
uncomfortable fact that 53%
of white women voted for
Trump despite (or more worry-
ingly, possibly because of) his
opposition to women’s health-
care rights, pay equity & his
well-known “pussy grabbing”
comments. Other people have
written far more eloquently
about the issues around main-
stream 'white feminism' but
recognising your own blind
spots and doing your best to
educate yourself can only help.
Empathise
OK, so this one is for the
people who thought the march
wasn’t a big deal and we’re
all just being overly dramatic
or competitively 'woke' or
whatever. I’m not going to try
and convert you to the cause
because I’ll just be wasting
column inches and my breath.
You don’t have to agree with
me, or the rest of the people
who marched. But millions
did march worldwide, so
dismissing everyone who was
involved as 'sensitive snow-
flakes' is an ignorant move
to begin with. Whether you
think their feelings are justified
or not, in the world of Trump
and Brexit, people are scared.
Islamophobia has never been
so obvious than the online
abuse Linda Sarsour, one of
the organisers of the Women’s
march, has faced, including
false accusations of anti-Sem-
itism and terrorist links. We
like to think discrimination of
minority groups was a prob-
lem we left behind us, in the
20th
century, but the data just
doesn’t back that up, the suc-
cess of the Trump campaign
confirms it. I think being told
you have 'privilege' whether it
be male, white or straight pro-
vokes such a strong response
in people because it implies
you’ve had it easy. The truth is
very few people have it com-
pletely easy. But really, it just
means that other people have
had to deal with obstacles that
you haven’t. It doesn’t mean
you have to feel bad, but in a
world of instant outrage and
political polarisation, empathy
to those who are different from
you is invaluable.
