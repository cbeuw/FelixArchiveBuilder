This week you’re
Shia Labeouf and his
new art installation.
Probably the cringiest
thing to happen on a
webcam since, well…
we don’t talk about
that anymore.

This week you’re
Barack Obama.
After eight years
of putting up with
everyone else’s shit,
you’re finally free of
the White House. You
spend all week just in
your pants.
This week you’re
SportImperial. Will
you ever catch a
break? Maybe next
year everyone will
finally forget about
that pesky sexism
scandal.
This week you’re
Usain Bolt and lose
one of your gold
medals as your
teammate tests positive
for drugs. And you
thought group project
work at Imperial was
frustrating...
This week you attend
the super secretive,
super shady event
on campus. Media
blackouts. Heightened
security. Police dogs.
DocSoc bar night
must’ve really got out
of hand.
This week you attend
the Union Bar’s 60th
birthday celebrations.
First event with floor
coverings. Biggest
ever. Period. And
pictures showing
anything else are
doctored.
This week you’re locked
in your department
overnight. Tired, hungry
and confused you stumble
into the PhD staffroom
to find them all sleeping
upside down from the
ceiling like vampires.
You’re one of them now.
This week you’re
Piers Morgan, and
you’re a tool. Except
that’s unfair on tools
as they’re useful and
advanced human
progress in the Stone
Age. The era where
Piers’s views are from.
This week you
figure out a loophole
in education. The
trick to passing your
exams isn’t to learn
the material but rather
your own, alternative,
facts. Genius.
This week you watch
Trainspotting 2. You
thought the sequel
would finally live up
to its name but the
only Flying Scotsman
you saw was Ewan
McGregor.
This week you’re
beginning to plan for your
Union election campaign,
taking influences from the
successful political leaders
of the recent past. You try
the Nigel Farage method,
drinking heavily and
spreading hate. Instant
success.
This week you’re
Mexico and end up
paying for something
that you’ll never use
and in the grand
scheme of things is
worthless. Cheer up, at
least you’re not paying
£9000 a year at UCL.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I need advice. I’m having second thoughts about my deci-
sion of voting Donald Trump for US President. I was totally
behind him. Like sure, he’s not exactly charismatic or attrac-
tive. He doesn’t have good skin, or great hair. And I wouldn’t
call his eyes kind. I mean I can’t actually see them through all
those flaps of eye-bag skin. But the way he says SAD always
gets me.
But I digress. I’m second guessing my vote because I got
upset after his waterboarding comments. I mean I have
to draw the line somewhere and torture is kind of a deal
breaker for me. I don’t know. I’m really conflicted.
What do you think?
Yours,
Kathrin Kim Karchner
Dear Kat
Can I call you cat? Personally I’m not a mas-
sive Trump fan. It’s not about the looks, let’s be
honest under the right lighting you couldn’t tell
him and Hillary apart.
It’s about policy. And I just can’t get behind
this executive order rage. Like ok, maybe
don’t wait seven years until you stop caring
and start signing executive orders (you know
who you are *cough* OBAMA *cough* –
wow coughing is a lot less discreet when it’s in
writing), but you’re a democratically elected
official not Kim Jong Un.
Anyway as I was saying. I care about policy.
Not whatever it is he likes to do in bed. I mean
sure, waterboarding is not exactly my cup of
tea. I mean ew. I can barely handle my own
wee let alone someone else’s. Truth is I’m really
HOROSCOPES
vanilla. Like a friend once gave me edible
underwear and… well hm.. Actually I don’t
think I ever spoke to Tom again after that.
See?
So to summarise; Though your decision to vote
Trump is indeed deplorable, the fact that him
making some prostitutes pee on a bed is
making you rethink that decision is even worse!
So grow a backbone and if you’re gonna
make bad decisions, at least stick with them
until the bitter end. There’s nothing worse than
the lack of conviction (other than the lack of
condoms when you really need one).
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
