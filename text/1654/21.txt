ight months ago
the UK government
banned so-called
‘legal highs’ under
the Psychoactive
Substances Act.
The law was intended to
stunt the trade of synthetic
chemicals that reproduce the
effect of traditional illegal
drugs. According to the
Office for National Statistics,
deaths linked to new
psychoactive substances (the
catchy government-approved
name for legal highs) rose
from 82 in 2014 to 114 in
2015, so it’s easy to see
why politicians wanted them
banned so quickly.
After the first three months
of the ban coming into force,
nearly 200 people were
arrested due to some form
of involvement with legal
highs. If nothing else, we can
say for certain this has put
an increased strain on our
already creaky police depart-
ment. Additionally, hundreds
of shops have also shut down
or stopped selling legal highs.
So much for the government’s
commitment to help small/
local businesses.

Psychoactive Substances,
Commander Simon Bray, said
in a press conference that
nearly 14,000 nitrous oxide
canisters (commonly known
as laughing gas) had been
seized by the Metropolitan
Police since the introduction
of the act on May 26th
2016.
He said this in a rather glum-
faced serious manner. Maybe
he should have had some
laughing gas before he went
up to speak.
Before this new legislation
was introduced, suppliers
of legal highs could often
skirt around existing rules by
simply tweaking the chemical
formula of the substance.
Once upon a time, when the
government was made aware
of a new chemical composi-
tion they would outlaw that
unique molecular structure.
As a result, manufacturers
would then simply tweak their
product to bring it into line
with the law. The govern-
ment since has since become
tired of this cat and mouse
game, which has led to the
introduction of the current
legislation. Basically, “the
law can’t be outwitted in
that sense anymore because
if it’s psychoactive, it’s
psychoactive full stop”, said
our old friend Commander
Simon Bray. Therefore, this
allows the police to criminal-
ise vast swathes of young
people under the blanket ban
automatically. Perhaps not
something very in touch with
the democratic underpinnings
of the United Kingdom.
It is notable that this doesn’t
apply to alcohol, caffeine and
cigarettes, which are exempt
from the new ban, despite
this in mind would it not be
logical to, you know, perhaps
research them? Coming from
Imperial College, an almost
all-science university (Business
School I’m looking at you),
it is inherent to us to perform
research. I can’t imagine the
grade I’d get if I shit out a
lab report without doing any
form of background research,
experimental research, or
just any kind of research.
But that appears to be the
of these drugs, however,
cocaine has been banned for
many decades and that stuff
still hasn’t disappeared.
With the government contin-
ually waging an all-out war
on drugs, it appears that we
will never see the day when
these potentially innovative
substances could be used
in research. But then again,
what do you expect when the
Prime Minister has a degree
in geography?

also having psychoactive
effects. I would wager that
the percentage of people that
die due to alcohol or ciga-
rette related deaths is vastly
higher than the percentage
of those who die from psy-
choactive substances. With
State for Health and Lord
Chancellor and Secretary of
State for Justice all having
studied philosophy, politics
and economics at Oxford this
confirms my suspicions. When
so many of the leaders of our
country studied basically a
degree in banter, it’s hardly
surprising that they’re immune
to the benefits, or methods, of
research.
With the new law banning
all psychoactive substances
coming into effect only eight
months ago we are yet to
see its full effects. In all
probability we will probably
see a reduction in the usage
exact approach of the British
government, you’d think
that none of them studied a
respectable degree. Oh wait.
They didn’t. With the Chan-
