weet potato
brownies, smooth-
ie bowls, tofu
cheesecake, cour-
gette noodles.
Call it, name it,
it’s all out there. The crowned
diet gurus so charismatical-
ly persuade you to convert
to these superior versions.
God forbid refined sugar.
No dairy. No gluten. Ca-
pri-Sonne? What’s that?
I don’t hate these things,
and one of each healthy des-
sert category a week (give
me a warmed vegan apple
crumble cheesecake anytime,
friend) could do my sweet
tooth and insulin levels some
good. Some may also turn
to these options for ethical
reasons, to avoid animal
products. But something is
a little fishy when trends
become obsessions, and
obsession turns into fear, and
fear spurs total elimination of
food groups. This health con-
sciousness does have a rather
ugly truth.
Just recently, I had the per-
sonal privilege of watching
a pretty newly-released BBC
documentary, hosted by the
clever and amusing Giles
Yeo, who sharply and fluidly
shuts down all nonsensical
nutrition theories promoted
by today’s social media-cum-
pseudo-health gurus such as
the anti-grain Hemsley sisters,
sweet-potato-head Deliciously
Ella (Ella Woodward), and
alkaline diet king Dr. Robert
Young. I implore you all to
watch the documentary your-
selves for a more hard-hitting
impact than my black and
white words, but a few key
points I did find intriguing and
simple enough to relay right
here.
Let’s start with the alkaline
diet, championed by Dr
Young. He proposes the idea
that more alkaline foods such
as most fruits and vegeta-
bles, soybeans and tofu, will
balance the pH of our slightly
acidic blood, all in the context
of disease supposedly being
down to the environment
in which the bacteria are
in, not the pathogen itself.
Effectively, this is a big slap in
the face to the founders of the
germ theory of disease, such
as Pasteur and Koch, who
acknowledged the bacteria
or virus as the causative
agents, not the environment.
This sounds slightly horrific
in the context of science
and medicine, as it is germ
theory which forms the
platform of our biomedical
understanding. Yeo called
it ‘anti-intellectual, anti-fact
and anti-evidence based’.
Another popular diet now-
adays is the gluten-free diet,
which only has an effect
if you’re born with coeliac
disease, or an intolerance to
this particular food group.
Gluten itself is the main
protein of wheat, and pro-
ponents of this diet such as
the sparkly Hemsley sisters
argue that gluten increases
inflammation and enhances
all sorts of nasty infections.
The science behind this? Dr.
Yeo went behind the scenes
to meet scientists research-
ing this effect. The idea
is that gluten creates gut
permeability thanks to its
protein component, ‘gliadin’,
and this consequently allows
more foreign substances
through, enhancing infection
infiltration and sustained
inflammation. Though it
does make sense, this, once
again, is not properly sci-
entifically backed, and you
may already be born with a
leakier gut, a faulty immune
system, or simply have a
genetic predisposition to
intolerance of gluten.
Oh, and the whole
no-grain fad? Dr. William
Davis, author of Wheat
Belly, argues that a
completely grain-free
diet supports a healthy
immune system since there
are apparent connections
between grain and some
auto-immune diseases.
However, gastroenterologist
Alessio Pasano, who ironi-
cally inspired Dr. Davis with
some of his studies in the first
place, does not agree. In fact,
the popularized book ‘Grain
Brain’ argues that less than
50g of carbohydrates a day
could have a positive effect
on a whole host of diseases
such as tourette’s, ADHD,
mood disorders and epilepsy.
I hate to admit it, but this
is the zenith of unnecessary
harm. All around us there
are just scintillas of truth. The
current proliferation of too
much and too far should be
stemmed, and maybe you
should put your feet up and
relax with a real brownie. If
you’re one of those who feel
anxiety around a piece of
cake, acknowledge the fear,
but try and see how these
foods actually effect your
body, as everyone is different.
Think about what’s really
wrong here: your choice, or
false information?
F
act: You can get
glow-in-the-dark
ice cream.
You might have
heard somewhere
that Tonic water
glows under UV light, but
the story of the glow-in-the-
dark ice cream takes all that
one step further. Its jellyfish
flavoured!
Using the physics of
fluorescence, animals can
produce light by a phenome-
non called bioluminescence
– they produce proteins
which absorb light and
then emit it in a particular
colour, making them glow in
the dark to attract mates or
warn off predators. Jellyfish
are some of the most famous
bioluminescent creatures,
since the ‘green fluorescent
protein’ (GFP) made by them
revolutionized biological
experiments by allowing
scientists to mark specific
proteins in cells and thus
watch them under a fluores-
cent microscope.
The company ‘Lick Me,
I’m Delicious’ has now put
that same protein in an ice
cream, so when the protein
is warmed up and exposed
to the ions in your saliva it
begins to emit light – or to
put it simply, it glows when
you lick it. Awesome? Yes.
Expensive? Yes: £140 per
scoop to be precise.
Perhaps more insane, the
same company made a
flavour of ice cream called
‘The Arousal’, which con-
tains 25mg of Viagra per
scoop and tastes like cham-
pagne. Just make sure you
don’t comfort eat the whole
tub in one sitting.
