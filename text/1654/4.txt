with May possibly realising
that this could be the route that
the UK needs to take post Brex-
it. Britain will “welcome agree-
ment to continue to collaborate
with our European partners on
major science, research, and
technology initiatives”, chiefly
because without this collabora-
tion, UK universities just aren’t
as attractive to students and re-
searchers.
Slightly more concrete plans
Union launches 2017-20 strategy
But where did all the measurables go?
Lef Apostolakis
a new team of Sabbatical
Officers every year might not
be the best plan for moving
forward effectively. With such
a short term vision and a lack
of long term measurables, it is
easy to lose the ball especially
when most changes require
years of lobbying.
On the plus side the students
did get a series of positive
announcements including a
long overdue 10% increase in
Clubs and Societies spending
(which has been lagging
behind inflation for a number
of years), as well as the
refurbishment of the Charing
Cross common room.
According to a Union
source that would like to
remain anonymous, the lack
of detailed action proposals
might be due to current
staffing problems. There
certainly has been a lot of
mobility recently, with several
staff members leaving the
union and reshuffling within
the organisation over the last
year. The union has refuted
such claims though.
T
he Union launched
a new three year
strategy last week
in Metric, at an
event that was the
culmination of a
six month effort to meet (or
at the very least express) the
needs and wants of Imperial
students. Despite vigorous
consultation though, student
reaction was luke-warm.
Thestrategyisacollaborative
effort between the Officer
Trustees and the Management
of the Union. Efforts first began
last March and involved
multiple public consultations,
surveys and interviews.
During the launch, welcome
speeches were given by Union
President Nas Andriopoulos
addressing “the young minds”
of Imperial, followed by the
Chair of the Board of Trustees,
Neil Sachdev, and the Union
Managing Director Jarlath
O’Hara.
Its five main “aims” and
15 “objectives” can be
summarised in increasing the
Union’s reach, its support
capacity, enhancing student
enjoyment and “talents”,
empowering students and
overall ensuring a smooth
running Union.
The strategy might look nice
on paper, however there is
not much information on how
the Union aims to achieve
its objectives. Undeniably
“deepening, firing up and
extending democracy” is a
noble (and meme-inspiring)
ambition, though some
students felt that the lack of
measurable strategic points
detracted from the sentiment.
“You can’t just hold an event
for deepening, extending and
engorging. Where is the rest
of the strategy?” said Theresa
Davey, a materials PhD
student who’s spent nearly
a decade at Imperial. “Five
sets of bullet points and three
student testimonials are not a
strategy that you can have a
party for.”
This becomes particularly
obvious when comparing the
new strategy to the previous
one. Although the 2013-16
strategy had very similar aims,
each aim had not only more
objectives but objectives which
were much more tangible.
For example to improve
the student experience, the
2013-16 strategy clearly
and concisely outlined eight
measures to be adopted by
2016 such as “ensure that
the Union delivers at least
three key contributors to the
College’s Graduate Attributes
project” or “increase the
number of students employed
by the Union in each year of
the plan”.
Similarly to build the student
community the union would
try to “publish an annual
‘Advocacy to Action’ Report”
and “develop, publish and
deliver a Campus Outreach
Plan” by 2016. These are parts
from two specific proposed
actions from a list of seven.
The new strategy on the
other hand aims to “enhance
the enjoyment and talents of
our members” (i.e. enhance
student experience in 2013
lingo) by “[providing] systems,
staff support and funding for
volunteers to enable them to
maximise the impact of their
Roles” and “[being]
recognised as leaders for the
value that our activities add
to students’ personal and
professional development”.
These are two full objectives
from a list of three and quite
literally amount to almost a
fifth of the strategy.
“The 2013-16 and 2017-20
strategies are intentionally
very different in their style
and composition,” says
Andriopoulos. “The 2013-
16 strategy, Our Plan, had
the task of transforming
Imperial College Union after
a challenging period, and
it did so by setting specific,
measurable targets –
consolidating our strengths
(such as Clubs, Societies &
Projects), creating specific new
initiatives (such as the Student
Academic Choice Awards,
Imperial Plus, and Give It A
Go), and focusing on financial
viability.” Andriopoulos refers
to the disastrous 2011 Summer
Ball which made a loss of
over £100,000, effectively
bankrupting the Union.
Yet it’s not quite as
straightforward to tell what
was actually achieved during
the 2013-16 plan. There is no
comprehensive report on the
strategy. Instead there are
plans “to publish a review of
Our Plan 2013-16 later this
academic year.” Andriopoulos
continues by saying that “when
the plan was in effect, there
was an annual Operational
Plan which set out that year’s
specific targets, and the
performance of staff teams
was assessed against these.
We also published updates
in our Impact Reports, as well
as extensive communication
to students and internal
communication to staff.” It’s
unclear however what the
policy makers learned from the
previous strategy and whether
they’ve implemented it in this
round of policy making.
The Union claims its strategy
to be in line with best practice
from the charitable sector,
drawing comparison with
the strategies of Amnesty
International and Shelter,
whichhaveannualoperational
plans with more concrete,
measurable goals. The Union
does suffer an annual brain
drain due to the electoral
process though, so coming up

icines Agency, predicted to
take itself and its 700+ jobs to
another European location. A
similar UK board may emerge
in its place to try and pick up
both the jobs and the role, but
that might be a little too much
planning and foresight for Jer-
emy Hunt.
So what can we expect in the
next few months? Well aside
from the actual negotiation of
Brexit, the Supreme Court dis-
missed the Government’s ap-
peal of the High Court’s ruling
on the process of triggering
Article 50. What it all boils
down to is that a bill needs to
be passed that then allows the
Government to trigger Article
50. Tory MPs in favour of Brex-
it are looking to fast track the
bill as soon as possible (likely
before the end of February)
but opposition MPs may try
and amend/stall the bill on its
way through. Put simply, bar-
ring a massive shock, this bill
will go through the House of
Commons and likely through
the House of Lords too. Any
attempt to block the bill after
the referendum will probably
spark chaos. Chaos that could
range anywhere from the Dai-
ly Mail getting a bit upset, to
a general election or even the
abolition of the House of Lords.
Stay tuned.
T
he sun keeps on
rising, the world
keeps on spinning
and the Brexit de-
bate rages on. Last
week Theresa May
made a speech at Lancas-
ter House which outlined her
twelve point plan for the UK’s
negotiation plan as she looks
to trigger Article 50 and leave
the European Union for good.
The main headline is, if the
PM gets her way, the UK will
be pursuing a “harder” Brexit,
one in which the UK leaves the
single market. This is in tandem
with the UK planning to forge
new trade deals with the wider
world, likely the topic of con-
versation as May meets with
President Trump next week.
With the UK leaving the sin-
gle market (or at least planning
to), freedom of movement is
almost undoubtedly going to
diminish, but May still wants to
maintain the Common Travel
Area within Ireland. Having
a land border with the EU is
tricky to say the least, especial-
ly with the mantra “controlling
our borders” being brought up
time and time again. Speaking
of the constituent countries with-
in the union, May has promised
that when powers are brought
back from Brussels, the rele-
vant ones will be devolved to
Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. How much is devolved
remains to be seen though. This
is also a little tricky in Northern
Ireland at the moment as the
two parties in power are hav-
ing their own fight over heating
bills (like you and your house-
mates) and have called a set of
elections in early March to try
and restore order again.
The PM also announced a
bit more transparency with
regards to her strategy, but
would not be revealing the
“blow-by-blow details” (that’s
one for all you playing Brexit
buzzword bingo at home). It
was also announced, unsur-
prisingly, that a new free trade
agreement with European mar-
kets is being pursued after we
leave the common market, as
we try and pick and choose as
much of the good stuff of EU
membership whilst avoiding
all the downsides. Easy, right?
The final proposal will be put
to a vote in both Houses at the
end of it all, but it’s likely that
this vote will go through in the
Commons at least, due to the
Conservative majority.
Science and innovation was
also brought up in the speech,
are to be laid out in a ‘white
paper’, essentially a more for-
mal statement of government
policy going forward. This will
be a statement of intent from
the government and gives op-
position parties (and indeed
opposition within her own par-
ty) a chance to scrutinise the
plans in full.
