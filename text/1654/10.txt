he first feeling I had
when viewing the
trailer for Jackie
was a familiar
weariness: here
was a story that
sounded interesting, but was
and forth between the assas-
sination itself, Jackie’s 1962
televised tour of the white
house, and meetings with vari-
ous characters in her life.
The supporting cast is
comprised of many fine
performances, with a par-
ticular highlight being Peter
Sarsgaard – who is endlessly
charismatic and mercurial
in any role he is given – as
John F. Kennedy. The film
also features Greta Gerwig,
Richard E. Grant, John
Carroll Lynch, and John Hurt,
whose Irish priest character
seems to be unsure in what
accent he is supposed to be
speaking. Since most of the
film is spent in Boston and the
wider Massachusetts area, it
is inevitable there is an Irish
priest, but Hurt’s accent seems
to slip from Dublin, back to
his own, and then somewhere
theme is echoed throughout
the film.
Indeed, this is found within
the excellent Under the Skin
composer Mica Levi. First
of all, it is refreshing to find
that the composer is not a
middle-aged white man or
Justin Hurwitz. Levi is the
first female nominee since
2000, and one of only three
women to have been nomi-
nated for scoring a film. The
music hauntingly combines
both synthesised keyboards
and strings, and – like all
great film music – works
as a unique piece of art by
itself. Even if you remember
no melodies at all from the
soundtrack, you will remem-
ber the hair-raising string
leitmotif that starts the film: as
the strings descend, they slur,
almost out of tune, but even-
tually find a solid note upon
which to remain transfixed. In
a lot of ways, this main theme
seems to be emblematic of
Jackie herself. Her inner tur-
moil manifests externally as
rambling about how Lincoln’s
widow had to sell all their
furniture and died alone, but
towards the end of the film,
as she dictates what may and
may not be published in LIFE,
we see her move past the
grief to find her stability.
As the credits started to roll,
and everybody remained in
their seats for just a moment
longer, there was one line
that echoed through my head:
“I have grown accustomed
to what people believe and
what I know to be real”.
Jackie is an immersive exam-
ination of the dichotomy of
public and private personas,
but above that, it is a complex
interrogation of grief and
what the living must come to
terms with once the dead are
buried.

in-between.
Larraín displays a huge
amount of control and
reserve in his depiction of the
assassination and its brutal
aftermath. It is a perfect
demonstration of the effective-
ness of controlled violence,
where the explicit gore lasts
merely seconds, but stays with
you long after the scene ends.
From the opening scenes,
Larraín manages to maintain
a pace that never feels self-in-
dulgent. Each interaction and
every shot of Portman feels
important in creating this
emotional landscape, and at
no point in its one hour and
40 minutes’ running time did
I feel bored. The camera is
primarily focussed on Natalie
Portman’s face, allowing us
to see every quiver of the
eyebrow, every pursing of
the lips. At times Stephane
Fontaine’s cinematography is
almost claustrophobia-induc-
ing, and in the most emotional
scenes it seems almost too
invasive, making you wish
that the camera would step
away from Jackie.
Natalie Portman’s perfor-
mance is a masterful one,
with every vocal tic, nuance,
and the breathy lilt of Jackie’s
voice being captured in a
hauntingly perfect inter-
pretation. There have been
many reviewers who have
described her performance
as camp and alienating, and
in all fairness, there are a few
lines where the theatricality
and archness of her delivery
seem almost overacted. With
that said, this is clearly inten-
tional: Larraín shows us how
Jacqueline Kennedy, the wife
of a former congressman, has
been thrust into the spotlight
with no obvious desire to
be famous, and as such has
created this public persona as
an extension of her husband’s
political persona. The way
she trips over her words
during the white house tour,
or the nervous darting of
her eyes, casting around for
support, add up to create a
woman whose entire identity
was contained within her hus-
band and his career. From the
moment she was left grasping
the splintered fragments of
her husband’s skull, this dual-
ity was shattered, and this

What I am happy to report,
however, is that Jackie – the
first english-language film
by Chilean director Pablo
Larraín, probably best known
in the UK for his Gael García
Bernal-starring 2012 film NO
– is a wrought, tense, and
immensely powerful drama,
one that has not left my mind
for days.
The screenplay by Noah
Oppenheim is an extremely
impressive piece of writing,
expertly weaving multiple
timelines and interactions
into a straightforward story.
The narrative straddles
a number of timeframes,
but is underpinned by an
interview for LIFE Magazine,
conducted a week after her
husband’s assassination
by Billy Crudup’s unnamed
journalist. From the front room
