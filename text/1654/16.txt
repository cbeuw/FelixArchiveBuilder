Tne rising chorus of South Asian voices
L
ast Saturday, Aziz
Ansari continued
his meteoric rise to
prominence by being
the first person of
South Asian descent
to host SNL. In his speech,
he highlights the rise of a
so-called ‘lower-case KKK’;
the subtle resurgence and
renormalisation of white
supremacy. Now more than
ever, he suggests, minorities
need to speak out and resist.
South Asians especially
have traditionally been
under-represented in media,
and whether by chance or for
cultural reasons, any distinct
South Asian voice has been
virtually non-existent in the
zeitgeist. With Trump’s build-
ing assault on Islam and the
inevitable swell of suspicion
and racism that follows, it is
\\ South Asians

traditionally been

media \\
increasingly important for
there to be prominent brown
voices in the mainstream.
Fortunately, this seems to
be changing as of late, with
the increasing popularity of
shows like Master of None,
and The Night Of. These are
shows that explore the South
Asian voice with grace, sub-
tlety and, most importantly,
reserved ferocity. For the
longest time, any defences
of ‘brown’ culture had to be
made timidly, as if making the
defence itself was some sort
of indication of guilt. Those
like Ansari and Riz Ahmed,
however, are no longer afraid
to flaunt their identities. Fol-
lowing the paths laid down by
people like M.I.A, Ansari and
Ahmed speak boisterously,
unafraid to hold society to
account.
Ansari’s Master of None,
hopefully returning for its
second season this year, deals
with his difficulty getting work
as an Indian actor, and the
way western media tends to
reduce them to stereotypes.
Similarly, The Night Of deals
with the uphill struggle young
Muslim men face just to not
be presumed guilty. To his
credit, Ahmed has long been
producing work that explores
alternative minority narra-
tives, such as Four Lions and
The Road to Guantanamo.
Unfortunately, these didn’t
have anywhere near as much
attention as they deserved.
Ahmed’s participation in
Rogue One and the hip-
hop duo Swet Shop
Boys seems to be
changing all that.
Hip-Hop was
conceived as a
triumphant voice
of rebellion.
There is no need
to be timid or
defensive, and it
demands the full
embrace of any
culture that uses
it as a voice. If any
medium would lend
itself to the protest we
need, it is this. Thankfully,
Riz Ahmed and Heems, of
Das Racist fame, have seen fit
to give us exactly that. Swet
Shop Boys fuses and covers
every niche of South Asian
culture, and flamboyantly
flaunts them.
Riz, a Pakistani Muslim,
Change rarely comes from where you expect it \\ Tyler Ross
and Heems, a Hindu Pun-
jabi, blend their individual
identities and loudly shout
down the casual racism often
directed towards brown
people. The album loudly
kicks off with stereotypical
Arabic music – the kind that
one might normally find in the
soundtrack for Homeland,
loudly announcing the arrival
of a terrorist. SSB, however,
embrace the beat and use it
to rail against the injustices
and frustrations propagated
by racial profiling. Through-
out the course of the rest of
the album, Riz and Heems
weave a tapestry of ear-
worms and bangers that
catch the attention of any lis-
tener, simultaneously filing
their grievances with an
unsuspecting audience.
Echoing the Public
Enemies and Black-
stars of the past,
SSB channels
the frustrations
and concerns
of South Asians
through a viru-
lently pervasive
medium. Hope-
fully, more South
Asians will ride
the slipstreams of
Ansari, Ahmed, and
Heems to vocalise our
concerns unflinchingly.
