andori nationals
are coming up,
and Imperial
Jiu Jitsu has to
be prepared!
This weekend
an Imperial versus Queen
Mary friendly, regional
ground-fighting competition
took place as practice for
both clubs before nationals.
Groundwork is a lot of fun,
but very tiring when you’re
the one stuck in a hold. It
is very much like trying to
escape a really, REALLY tight
hug. Here, most competitors
agreed not to use any chokes
or strangles; let’s all play nice
and friendly.
The session started with a
warm up led by QM instruc-
tor Alex Macaulay, involving
the usual running around:
push ups, sit ups, squats and
burpees, but also climbing
over and around each other,
because why not? Forget all
notions of personal space
once you start any kind of
groundwork, the more up
close and personal you get,
the better. In fact, to keep
your opponent pinned to the
ground you have to put them
in a hold they cannot escape,
usually by putting all your
weight on top of them (gets
a bit more difficult to breath
if you do that on their chest),
or applying some kind of
joint lock. As you go up the
grades you can learn more
techniques, holds, and locks
such as the ones Imperial Jiu
Jitsu affectionately nicknamed
‘69’ (officially ‘yoko shiho
gatame’) or ‘the mount’
(officially ‘tate shiho gatame’,
another mouthful) because,
well…it becomes evident
when you see them.
In this type of competi-
tion, fights can start from a
sitting position or a standing
position (officially for green
belts and above). If starting
from a sitting position, the
two opponents are initially
back to back, legs straight,
feet together, and hands on
their thighs. The fight starts
when the referee says the
word ‘hajime’ (Japanese
for ‘begin’) and ends when
one of the opponents pins
their adversary’s back to the
ground for 20 seconds, which
is an awfully long time when
the person underneath you
is thrashing like crazy and
trying to wiggle out of your
hold. It can also end if one
of the participants taps out
(because they were in a joint
lock or feel they can’t escape
a hold) or if time runs out. The
rounds here were two minutes
per fight, plus one extra
minute if there is no defined
winner. If neither opponents
managed to hold the other
for 20 seconds or made them
tap out, the winner is decided
based on their pro-activity
and control. The referee must
say ‘yame’ (‘stop’) to officially
cease any fight.
If starting from a standing
position then the opponents
are face to face and try
to throw each other to the
ground, ideally making both
their adversary’s shoulders
(the famous ‘ippon’) touch the
ground, or at least one, with
control from the tori (the one
throwing) over the uke (the
one on the receiving end), to
declare a win. The referee
judges if the throw was clean
or if the round needs to be
reset. Here rounds were
also of roughly two to three
minutes, and as before the
winner is chosen based on
their initiative and control if
neither manage to throw the
other.
As rounds are very short,
genders and grades were
mixed during the compe-
tition so all could enjoy as
many fights as they wanted
and fight with everyone.
The participants were still
roughly separated by height/
weight class, as it is still a
very important parameter in
groundwork: there’s not much
you can do if somebody twice
your size is sitting on your
chest…maybe tickle them? Hit
them in the- wait no, that’s not
a legal move.
To finish on a nice and
friendly note after all that
rolling around on the tatami
mats, Imperial Jiu Jitsu organ-
ised a great (and cheap)
social in a fancy Korean
restaurant in Soho. Eating as
much Korean barbecue as
you want, mostly paid for by
the club. What more could
you ask for?
Imperial Jiu Jitsu is going to
have more friendly regional
competitions with other
London universities before the
big Randori Nationals at the
end of February in Northamp-
ton, so watch this space! Jiu
Jitsu is an amazing discipline
open to all in which you can
progress really quickly if you
set yourself to train regularly,
and you’re constantly sup-
ported by your peers and
instructors who want to help
you learn and get the best out
of every training session.
