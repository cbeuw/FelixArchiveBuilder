Terrains of the
Body is a bold
but beguiling
show
J
ohn Berger once
wrote, 'A woman
must continually
watch herself,’
The writer and
critic who died
earlier this month continued,
‘she is almost continually
accompanied by her own
image of herself.’ There
is never a situation where
Berger’s words don’t shed
light on complex ideas, but
these lines have heightened
relevance in regards to
Terrains of the Body, a
collection of photographs
from the National Gallery
of Women in the Arts,
currently being shown at the
Whitechapel Gallery.
The show – deliberately
taking place opposite a Guer-
rilla Girls exhibit highlighting
the lack of women in the arts
– attempts to pack a legion
of narratives within a small
space, connecting works from
17 artists working across five
continents. The linking thread
is that all works attempt
to deal with how women
photographers deal with the
female form in their work.
In some works, this is crystal
clear: Nan Goldin’s piece
from The Ballad of Sexual
Dependency, which charted
her life in New York of the
early 1980s, perfectly cap-
tures the heady combination
of celebration and tragedy
which defines her work. Simi-
larly, Rineke Dijkstra’s photos
are taken from her Beach Por-
traits series, which show teens
posing on a beach; Dijkstra's
work speaks of the awkward
transition point between child
and adult at which the subject
is placed.
In Anna Gaskell’s masterful
work, Eraser – a highlight
of the show, and the only
video-work on display – a
number of schoolgirls tell the
story of her own mother’s
death in a car accident.
Throughout the video, the nar-
rative voice changes, through
first, second, and third
person, until the boundary
between performer and audi-
ence, surveyor and surveyed,
is completely distorted.
This blurring of voices mir-
rors Gaskell’s photographic
work: entitled Untitled #104
(A Short Story of Happen-
stance). The image shows a
woman’s legs, sticking up and
juxtaposed against a back-
drop of woodland trees; the
implication is that something
has gone horribly wrong, but
the viewer is caught in the
middle of the story, left unsure
about what is happening or
why. Interrupted narratives
are further explored in Justine
Kurland’s unsettling works.

One shows pregnant women
and young children frolicking
by a waterfall, while the other
features two girls lying on
a raft, being dragged by a
third, possibly into the sea.
These images present the
female form in a way that
denies the viewer the satisfac-
tion of a complete narrative.
Hellen van Meene’s works
combine this unsteady sto-
ryline with a heady mix of
sensual textures and colours.
Her works are celebrations
of surface, with Vermeer-light
like dappling across her sub-
jects, bringing an incredible
sense of tactility. Janaina
Tschape’s work shares this
obsession with tone, and both
her and van Meene’s works
are reminiscent of Francesca
Woodman’s haunting self-por-
traits, albeit with less of an
emotional punch.
For other artists, photogra-
phy can be an opportunity to
examine the structures present
within the art world itself as
an institution. Kirsten Just-
esen’s piece, which draws on
her previous work in the fem-
inist art movement, sees the
artist herself transformed into
a work, as she climbs into a
display case of small statuary.
Justesen, who trained as a
sculptor, is simultaneously the
creator of art and a work of
art itself; she both represents
and is represented. Justesen
is no doubt aware – as the

Guerrilla Girls point out –
that many galleries would
much rather hang images of
women on their walls than
works by actual women. In a
similar theme, as part of her
Räumer series, Candida Höfer
shows the empty hall of the
Palazzo Zenobio in Venice,
but retains a reflection of
herself in a mirror, making her
presence fully known.
One of the highlights of
this show is the multiplicity of
voices on display. The name
of the show itself reflects
the multiple domains within
the works: ‘terrain’ can be
a representation of nature,
tracing the lineage of the
‘earth mother’ iconography;
but it also links in with power,
asking who has the right to
define what constitutes a
certain territory.
But while multiple meanings
can be a great thing to expe-
rience, the exhibition is let
down by the lack of explana-
tory context for many of the
works. This is most obviously a
problem in Marina Abramov-
ić’s piece, The Hero: originally
a video-work dedicated to
her father, which featured
her singing the Yugoslavian
national anthem from the time
of General Tito, in this exhibi-
tion it is only a still, meaning
we miss out on the full power
of the original. Similarly,
Nikki S. Lee’s pieces, from
her series Projects, depict her
immersing herself in different
American subcultures until she
is accepted – like Cindy Sher-
man gone method actor – but
the audience is never made
aware of this.
Throughout Terrains of the
Body there are moments of
clarity, where everything
begins to come together,
but these are too often
interrupted with pieces whose
lack of contextual information
distorts their meaning and
lessens their impact. If you
want to get the most of this
strange terrain, I’d suggest
bringing your own map.
