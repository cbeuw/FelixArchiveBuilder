work than, say, Arrival, with
complex direction from Pablo
Larraín bolstering the tricky
screenplay, which darts back
and forth. That being said, I
am thrilled that the Academy
has recognised Mica Levi for
her haunting score, following
her noted omission for Under
the Skin a few years ago.
She is only the third woman
to be nominated for scoring
a film, and she more than
deserves to win the top prize.
The most noted omission,
for me, is Antonio Campos’
Christine, which tells the story
of depressed TV presenter
Christine Chubbuck. As
already mentioned, I feel that
Hall should be up for the Best
Actress award, but it would
also be a well-deserved
nominee for Best Picture, Best
Director or Best Screenplay,
as well as any number of
other awards for its pitch-per-
fect 1970s production design.
So, what will happen come
February 26th? My predic-
tion – and everyone else’s
– is that La La Land will take
home most of the awards.
But what do the Academy
Awards even mean? Not that
much really. This might be
the most obvious of hot-takes
for anyone who follows the
world of film, but looking
back over the last decade
or so of ceremonies, and a
pattern becomes clear: how
little we really care about
the Oscars after everything
has died down. How many of
us can say that we regularly
watch The King’s Speech?
Or argue that Slumdog
Millionaire really represents
a masterpiece of modern
cinema? For me – and I know
this isn’t an opinion shared by
others – it seems unlikely that
I will watch La La Land again,
even if it wins top prize on
the night. But I will make sure
to watch the ceremony itself.
I might disagree with the
nominees, I might disagree
with the winners, I might even
agree with the entire ethos
of artistic competitions…but
damn if it’s not fun to take
part, even for an evening, in
all the pomp of Hollywood.
In the run-up to the Acad-
emy Awards, felix will be
running innumerable articles
on the nominees. If you’re
interested in letting us know
who should win Best Picture,
who has been overlooked, or
just how sick of awards you
are, drop us a line.
G
orillaz are
back – and
this time
they are as
political as
they are
whacky. Having teased a
new album through Instagram
and SoundCloud releases
over the past few months,
Gorillaz released the
brand new track Hallelujah
Money (ft. Benjamin
Clementine) on the eve of
Trump’s inauguration. The
Damon Albarn-led virtual
band described the track
in their own words as a
“commentary on a politically-
charged, historical moment”.
The track itself heavily
features the deep, powerful
voice of Clementine, which
dominates the track with an
omnipotent, commanding
aura. The lyrical parts sung
by Clementine imitate the
voice of Trump with eery
lines such as “Thank you my
friend/for trusting me” and
the sobering “It is love, that is
the root of all evil”. Further to
this, the music video and lyrics
are littered with references
to current affairs with the
imagery of “scarecrows from
the far east” and “I thought
the best way to perfect our
tree / Is by building walls”.
This is all underscored with
the most standout trait of the
song – a hypnotic underlying
beat, marked by an arrhyth-
mic beeping which persists
throughout the whole track
like an incurable sickness.
The verse builds up into an
exhausting chorus calling for
“hallelujah money”, which
is backed by an innocent
sounding choir, contrasting
Clementine’s deep vocals.
The resounding message of
the track follows succinctly
with Albarn’s melancholic
vocals which question how
we can know “we are still
human” in this new era of pol-
itics. Albarn’s speaker-tronic
voice also humbly asks “How
we will dream?” and “How
we will love?” in this new
system.
Artistically, the face of
Gorillaz is still recognisable
since their last commercial
outing in 2010. Interestingly,
this is not a marked official
Gorillaz release - the song is
not a single and can only be
found on the YouTube channel
of culture site uproxx.com.
The song comes with an
accompanying music video,
which is nowhere to be seen
on the recently revamped
Gorillaz website, suggesting
the piece is not something
from the body of work of the
upcoming album.
Although rather half-handed
in the nature of it’s release,
Hallelujah Money is an excel-
lent piece of work, teeming
with signature Gorillaz quirks.
Whilst the track offers loads
in itself, it’s only one side of
the coin, with the accompa-
nying music video providing
thought-provoking visuals on
top. Whilst Hallelujah Money
is intentionally separate from
the upcoming album, if it were
considered a sign of the music
to come, it wouldn’t be a bad
thing at all.

Our Culture Editor, Fred Fyles,
gives you the run-down on the
Academy Award nominations for
this year, from the meteoric rise of
LaLaLand,tothepossiblesuccess
of Moonlight, and all those films
that they missed along the way...
T
he announcement
of the nominees for
the 89th
Academy
Awards this
week marked the
beginning of the
end of the year-long awards
process, which begins with
the Cannes Film Festival
in May, and ends with the
Oscars, 8 months later. As
usual, the list of nominees
contains few surprises, with
the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences
choosing to stay on the
straight and narrow, throwing
out very few left-field choices.
Damien Chazelle’s musical
romp through an imagined
Hollywood, La La Land, leads
the pack, with 14 nomina-
tions; a record-tying haul, this
puts in on par with Titanic
and All About Eve as the
most nominated film of all
time. The raft of nominations
– which includes Best Film,
Best Actor, Best Actress, and
Best Director – is unsurpris-
ing; there is nothing more
that the Academy loves more
than a film which indulges
their romantic fantasies about
what commercial film-mak-
ing can achieve. One only
needs to look back to 2012’s
ceremony, when The Artist
and Hugo, both in thrall to
the ‘magic of cinema’, took
home five awards apiece.
Taking this into account, the
success of La La Land – which
essentially functions as a love
letter to Hollywood – is not a
shock.
The question is whether
La La Land can continue
the run it’s had this award
season, which peaked with
a record-setting night at the
Golden Globes, or whether
Moonlight or Arrival
– each with eight
nominations – can
knock it off the top
perch. If either had
a chance, it would
be Moonlight,
which has been
picking up critical
acclaim since
its premiere at
Telluride. (Arrival,
which has the bulk
of its nominations
in the more technical
categories, is likely to
fill in the Gravity/Mad
Max/Grand Budapest Hotel
space, with a high number
of wins, but none of the ‘big
ones’.) Online, there seems
to have been a rumbling of a
major categories. Casey
Affleck already seems to be
a shoe-in for the Best Actor
prize, with his emotionally
understated performance
as a man consumed with
silent grief. The Best Actress
award, meanwhile, is a more
open field: Emma Stone (La
La Land), Isabelle Huppert
(Elle), and Natalie Portman
(Jackie) have all been picking
up gongs, and Ruth Negga’s
performance in Loving could
also get some traction. The
inclusion of Meryl Streep
on the list – for the
underwhelming Flor-
ence Foster Jenkins
– leaves a nasty
taste in the mouth,
especially consid-
ering that Amy
Adams (who deliv-
ered two great
performances
this year in Arrival
and Nocturnal
Animals) is not even
nominated. I would
have also loved to see
Rebecca Hall rewarded for
her performance in Christine,
which – for me – has been
the best performance I’ve
seen all year.
The Best Director category

backlash against La La Land –
after months of being told that
it was a masterpiece, those
who went and found instead
an empty-hearted, reaction-
ary imitation of past greats
were sorely disappointed.
Manchester by the Sea
has also had a good run,
being nominated for six
awards, all of which are in
seems to be a breath of fresh
air, if only because Alejandro
G. Iñárritu decided 2016 was
miserable enough without him
releasing another film (thank
God). The last few years
have seen mainly big-budget
spectacles getting the Best
Director prize, but of the list
this year, only Hacksaw Ridge
seems to fit the traditional
macho mould (it remains to
be seen whether Mel Gibson’s
previous racist and homopho-
bic behaviour will stand in
his way). I would argue that
Arrival is more of a cerebral
affair than an SFX-flick, and
La La Land might be grand in
scope, but its set pieces are
noticeably more musically-in-
clined than previous winners.
What is grating with this
year’s list is the lack of
daring. Tom Ford’s Noctur-
nal Animals, a deep, heady
thriller, only gets a nod for
Michael Shannon in the Best
Supporting Actor category;
Amy Adams’ performance
goes unrecognised, and so
does Ford’s direction and
screenplay. Similarly, Jackie
only has three nominations,
for Best Costume Design, Best
Score, and Best Actress. It is a
far more audaciously daring
