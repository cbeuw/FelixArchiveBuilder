Ipsita Herlekar explains how fruit flies have been found to use logical reasoning when choosing
partners
A
new study has
discovered
that fruit flies
(Drosophila
melano-
gaster), unlike
many of us make rational
decisions while choosing
partners.
Experiments were con-
ducted by scientists from the
University of British Columbia
and University of Washing-
ton, where, individual male
flies were given the choice
of choosing between two
females as their mates. Male
fruit flies were paired with
10 different females flies of
different genetic strains. With
as many as 2700 trials using
different combination of male
and female fruit flies, it was
found that males were able to
pick out females that are most
likely to produce the maxi-
mum amount of offspring.
The males were also found
to be consistent in their
choices, choosing females
ranking higher in the hier-
archy over the others. For
example; if female fruit fly
A is the highest in rank, fol-
lowed by B, C, D and so on,
males, when given a choice
between A and B, always
chose A. Similarly when given
a choice between B and C,
the males chose B. The rank-
ing ranking of a female fruit
fly relates to the amount of
offspring it is able to produce.
Similar experiments were
conducted but, after impair-
ing either the sense of smell
or the sight of the male fruit
flies, their mate choosing
pattern remained unchanged.
However, when both their

Lizzie Riach gives an overview of new robotic technology designed to help keep the heart beating
after heart failure
A
so-called ‘soft
robot’ has
been invented
to help keep
the human
heart beating.
Developed by researchers
from Harvard University and
Boston Children’s Hospital,
the robot fits around the heart
and helps it pump blood. This
could mean a significantly
higher quality of life for peo-
ple that have survived heart
attacks but suffer from heart
failure, a growing popula-
tion in this day and age. The
robot itself does not come into
direct contact with the blood,
reducing potential risks such
as blood clotting. Instead, the
heart is encased in a sleeve
which mimics the outer layers
of cardiovascular tissue,
allowing the material to act
in a similar way to the heart
within it.
Around 41 million people
suffer from heart failure
worldwide, which is termed
as ‘the inability to pump suffi-
cient blood to the body’. Up
until now, the only option for
people with severe cases has
been heart transplants, but
donors are thin on the ground
and many die whilst on the
waiting list. Previous devices
to help heart function, known
as ‘ventricular assist devices’
(VADs) are limited, and are
used mainly as life-prolonging
therapy. VADs work by inter-
acting with valves to increase
blood flow, whilst patients
have to take blood-thinning
medications. Despite this,
clots often occur and cause
severe problems in up to 20%
of patients.
This new soft robot is
comprised of a silicon sleeve
that takes inspiration from the
heart itself and is designed
to simply enhance heart
function by closely mimicking
it. There have already been
in vivo results on a pig heart.
The robot itself is customiz-
able depending on which
side of the heart is weaker
and therefore needs more
help to pump blood. Despite
problems such as inflam-
mation at the device-tissue
interface, these preliminary
tests look promising. In the
current model, the device is a
tethered implantable system
that uses wall-compressed
air supply to allow the robot
to work. Future models will
either have to be made
smaller or, like other devices,
be worn around the waist of
the patient. A lot more testing

Wearing your heart in your sleeve
will have to be tested to look
at the long-term effects of
wearing this heart-saving
sleeve, as well as finding new
ways to attach it to the heart
tissue (the current methods
are not good for long-term
implantation).
This is an exciting step in
the field of applied robotics.
It looks like robots that can
easily interact with and mimic
tissues is the future could
have a firm future within the
medical world. Perhaps one
day it’ll be the norm to have
robotically-enhanced tissues
keeping us alive?

were impaired, the males
failed to detect the ranking
hierarchy in females, leading
the scientists to conclude that
the choices made earlier were
based on a combination of
visual and olfactory cues.
Making decisions based
on logic has always been
associated as a trait unique
to humans. This study turns
out to be among the first of
its kind, providing evidence
that some species besides
humans may also be capable
of rational decision making.
