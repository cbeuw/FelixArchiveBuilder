W
ell we honestly tried – you
know, taking a break from the
doom and gloom. With the end
of 2016, we were eager to turn
over a new leaf, start anew with
starry eyes full of hope for the
future. But since Trump’s inauguration last Friday, it’s
just been an onslaught of bad news, dumb news and
outright ridiculous news. Since Friday, the Donald
has broken Obamacare, has withdrawn from the
Transpacific Partnership, has reintroduced the Mexico
City Policy which effectively strips federal financial
support from any NGO lobbying for reproductive
rights, revived the Keystone XL and Dakota Access
pipelines, ordered the construction of a Mexico wall,
allowed six journalist to be charged with felony for
covering the anti-trump protests from last week, frozen
science grants from the Environmental Protection
Agency, and removed any mention of the LGBT
movement from the government’s website.
Also jumping on the bandwagon, every
>>insert descriptive term of choice<< in the US is
proposing backwards bills such as bills “to repeal
the Environmental Protection Agency’s most
recent rule for new residential wood heaters”
or bills proclaiming “each human life begins
with fertilization” or bills requiring “pipelines
regulated by the Secretary of Transportation to
be made of steel that is produced in the United
States” or God knows what.
Meanwhile the Brexit saga is dragging on
and on. It’s turned from hard to soft to fluffy to
snakeskin. Honesty I just want to know when to
pack my bags. Come on people, I got plans to
make, flights to book and a mojito somewhere in
a beach-bar with my name on it.
So read on and resist I guess, cause Shia
Labeouf is in prison and we need a new glorious
leader to create motivational viral hits, urging
us to “just DO IT”.
