he Union has
resolved to put
pressureonImperial
College to Improve
Career Services.
The decision came
after Eric Suen, a third year
medic raised the issue during
Council last Tuesday.
Suen acted on results from
a survey he carried out with
help from Officer Trustees and
Union staff, which revealed an
average satisfaction score of
3.6/5. The survey (which ad-
mittedly had a small sample of
only 48 participants) revealed
that users found booking ap-
pointments with Career Servic-
es very hard (3.9/5) with 30%
of participants having tried
and failed to secure appoint-
ments.
Career Services employ 17
members of staff of which only
six are career consultants.

Student calls out Career Services
Union pushes for resolving funding and staffing issues
Lef Apostolakis
spokesperson told felix
that “support is available
to students throughout the
year, including during the
summer vacation, and we
encourage students to be-
gin thinking about their
career plans as early as
possible”
Furthermore we were in-
formed that when demand
is high Imperial also re-
cruits freelance consult-
ants, while the Services
also offer a full range of
group support through dai-
ly workshops, seminars, in-
teractive sessions streamed
workshops through Panop-
to. Whether these services
are insufficient or simply
inadequately advertised
will be debated during the
long lobbying process that
is certain to come in the
following months.
employ twice as many career
consultants, an additional six
CV consultants and eight free-
lance career consultant pre-
sumably for seasonal spikes.
Considering that Imperial Col-
lege has 17,000 students while
LSE has approximately 9,000
students, the quality and quan-
tity of career advice at Imperi-
al is significantly lower.
This might come as a sur-
prise to many, as Imperial is
renowned for producing high-
ly employable graduates. Ac-
cording to The Times and the
Sunday Times’ Good Univer-
sity Guide 2016, Imperial is
ranked 2nd
in terms of gradu-
ate prospects. This discrepan-
cy is thought to be due to the
support departments give out
themselves though.
Weekly Career talks are for
example routine practice in
the departments of Earth Sci-
ence and Engineering. Similar-
ly the Science Communication
MS offered by the Department
of Co-curricular Studies is well
known for facilitating the net-
working of students with indus-
try giants through seminars
and internships.
Other departments are less
lucky. Industry oriented career
events in the department of
Life Sciences are notoriously
few and far between with stu-
dent looking to follow ‘green-
er’ paths such as Ecology of-
ten left to their own devices.
Those coming from such less
career-oriented departments
face a mediocre service.
The testimonials from Suen’s
survey don’t paint a flattering
picture
“They always say “very
good” to CVs and rarely give
any good advice. In terms of
job search they say “just goog-
le it” – Anonymous
“The most useful thing would
have been to know the dead-
lines. Goldman Sachs’ gradu-
ate deadlines were in August!
I have been applying this
October when really I should
have been applying the latest
September. Wish someone
had told me especially since
I had been to a careers ap-
pointment”.
Perhaps College will take
a page out of the book of
Simone Buitendijk (Vice
Provost for Education). Bui-
tendijk has been working
on redefining the teaching
strategy and one of the
key elements of her plan
has been identifying pock-
ets of good practice within
departments and trying to
apply them across the Col-
lege.
When asked about the
student dissatisfaction sur-
rounding Imperial’s Ca-
reer Services, a College
Mental Health Officer joins Union roles
Lef Apostolakis
U
nion Council has
voted to intro-
duce a new lib-
eration officer,
representing stu-
dents struggling
with mental health issues. Ap-
propriate steps will be taken
for the position to be created
in time for the elections in
March.
Liberation officers exist in or-
der to represent and campaign
for underrepresented students
and support the Deputy Pres-
ident for Welfare. Currently
there are seven roles. There’s
a Disabilities Officer meant
to represent the needs of stu-
dents with disabilities (both
physical and mental) but there
also are LGBT, Ethics and En-
vironmental, Gender Equality,
Interfaith BME, Campaigns,
and International officers.
Despite the existence of a
role meant to deal with mental
health, the paper proposing
the introduction of the new
role suggests it is not enough.
Arian Sadr-Hashemi, chair of
Mentality and author of the
paper believes that the cur-
rent role “does not provide
appropriate representation
for all students with mental
health issues”, that its duties
are “too broad” and that it is
necessary to bring “short term
mental health issues [such as]
grief and stress” to the Union’s
attention.
During her presentation on
Tuesday, Sadr-Hashemi said
that “we are at a very weird
point at mental health, where
it’s becoming more accept-
able to struggle with mental
health issues”, however she
stressed that despite positive
steps, some mental health is-
sues receive a very different
public treatment to others.
“We have to push that [sic] all
mental health issues are ac-
ceptable”. While addressing
Council members, she stressed
the need to represent all mi-
norities and urged the Union
to “keep up”.
The role would provide a
point of contact for students
wishing to get in touch with the
Disability Advisory Service,
Departmental Disability Of-
ficers and the Mental Health
Advice Service. It would also
liaise with Mentality (a ICU
campaign raising awareness
for mental health) to “facilitate
engagement of students with
mental health issues in Union
activity”.
Concerns of the constitution-
al inclusion in the role descrip-
tion of Mentality as a point of
contact were shut down using
the LGBT Officer as an ex-
ample who is constitutionally
meant to liaise with Imperial
600 and IQ, imperial’s net-
work for LGBT+ staff and stu-
dents respectively.
Still there are valid concerns
on what happens once the role
is created. It’s not uncommon
for Liberation Officer positions
to remain vacant after the first
or even the second round of
elections. At the moment, such
is the case with the Disabilities
Officer. We will have to wait
and see whether the Mental
Health Officer position proves
to be more attractive.
