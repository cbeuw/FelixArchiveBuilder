Police
ignore IC
after trophies
stolen
O N T H E 22nd August, F E L I X
reported that £ 5 0 0 0 worth o f
trophies h a d been stolen from
t h e I C U n i o n O f f i c e . T h e
t r o p h i e s h a v e n o t y e t b e e n
recovered a n d the police seem
to have made little progress.
T h e theft took place i n the
early morning of Tuesday 29th
July between two o'clock, when
Beit security made their patrol
and the time the cleaners opened
the office. A window was broken
in the Honorary Secretary's Office
to gain entry and then the rather
inadequate trophy cabinet lock
was snapped off.
A n unfortunate aspect of the
robbery is that it should never
have occurred. M a l c o l m Brain,
while he was Deputy President,
wrote to the Estates section of
College on 31st October and 3rd
D e c e m b e r , 1979, asking for a n
estimate for an alarm system and
better locks for the U n i o n Office.
Rachel Snee (present D P ) received
the reply on 9th July 1980, just
three weeks before the trophies
were stolen.
Even though the trophies are
insured for £ 5 , 0 0 0 , a n d are of
doubtless historical value, the
worth of them when melted down
is negligible, as most of the cups
were only silver-plated or pewter.
Three solid silver cups were left
behind! These factors have led
College Security to believe that
the robbery was the result of a
'grudge' against the Union, by,
perhaps an ex-student who knew
the layout of the U n i o n Office.
They have even gone so far as to
put f o r w a r d a suspect to the
police: a n ex-student w h o has
b e e n c o n v i c t e d o f theft a n d
vandalism in the College several
times in the past.

ENTS GIG VETOED
T H E New Musik concert a r r a n -
g e d b y I C E n t e r t a i n m e n t s
C o m m i t t e e for N o v e m b e r 23
has h a d to be cancelled because
College Block have withdrawn
the use of the Great H a l l .
New Musik, despite a successful
album and several popular singles,
agreed at the end of August to
play a gig at I C for half their
normal fee, provided the booking
was for a Sunday. E N T S agreed
and arranged a provisional booking
of the Great Hall. O n attempting
to confirm the booking, they were
told that C a p t a i n L i n d l e y , the
College Domestic Secretary, h a d
vetoed the decision.
Captain Lindley, when asked,
stated that the gig could not go
ahead as it was on a Sunday. This
meant, he said, that there would
would be problems over security,
c o m p l a i n t s from local residents
a b o u t d r u n k e n r o w d i e s o n a
S u n d a y night, a lot of people
would have to give up free time
to supervise the concert, a n d if
the Great H a l l were to be required
on M o n d a y morning the cleaners
wouldn't come in to set up for it.
M i k e F i r m s t o n . t h e E N T S
Chairman, brought up the follow-
ing salient points:
i) "Security are prepared to
do Sunday concerts provided they
are not punk bands".
ii) " M o s t people come to the
gigs by tube to South Kensington,
a n d t h e n o v e r t h e w a l k w a y ,
w h i c h e f f e c t s f e w r e s i d e n t s ;
f u r t h e r m o r e n o d r u n k w i l l be
allowed in the Great Hall and the
Union Bar is the nearest source of
a l c o h o l (a q u a r t e r o f a m i l e
away)".
iii) " T h e r e is no difference
between giving up time to supervise
a c o n c e r t o n a S u n d a y , a n d
g i v i n g u p time to s u p e r v i s e a
concert on a Saturday".
vi) " E N T S iias to clear u p
alter a concert, in fact, alter last
year's J o h n M i l e s concert. M i -
Thomas, the Domestic Manager
wrote to E N T S to congratulate
them o n their tidiness. I n a n y
case, no o n e h a d b o o k e d the
Great Hall lor M o n d a v morning.
A p p a r e n t l y C a p t a i n L i n d l e y
was very w o r r i e d about G r e a t
Hall concerts after all the corres-
pondence about a Jack T h e L a d
gig some years ago, though since
then several Sunday concerts have
gone off without a hitch; further-
more, E N T S booking for Caravan
on Sunday 16th November will
take place (College claim that this
was passed 'by mistake'). E N T S
need Sunday concerts as this is a
useful way of booking bands at
cheaper rates, a n d also tends to
draw a larger audience.
F o r t u n a t e l y for E N T S , they
have not been asked to p a y a
cancellation fee, but it is another
unfortunate set back for them. " A
similar situation occurred in 1977
when E N T S had to cancel Great
H a l l gigs due to the G L C enforcing
extra safety arrangements. That
dispute was best summed up by
the then E N T S Chairman, T i m
Fowler's, comment: " W e seem to
be the only venue of under 2,000
capacity where the G L C is exerting
its pressure. Travel to the R o u n d -
house, the Marquee, the Nashville,
or any similarly sized concert hall,
and look to see if they have got a
four foot barrier in front of the
s t a g e . A n d few o f t h e o t h e r
regulations come near to being
satisfied at these examples".
This autumn's situation is best
summed up by M i k e Firmston's
opinion ol College block's attitude.
" T h e r e are no Sunday concerts,
because there a r e n o S u n d a y
concerts".
Bloody great holes
in the skirting board!
