Micromouse
T h e E u r o p e a n M i c r o - M o u s e finals were held in Theatre A in M a t h s
on Wednesday 17th September. T h i s event, sponsored by H a w k e r
Siddeley, is a competition to find the quickest maze-solving robot.
T h e competition consisted of two parts: fastest r u n ; a n d virtuoso
performance (judged by the audience).
T h e mice were very ingenious;
one had sonar and another had
'crab-like' diagonal and forward
motion. However, both of these
failed to complete the maze, the
latter contestant complaining that
his m o u s e n e e d e d a p r e c i s e l y
built maze. T h e winner (Stirling
Mouse) and only one to complete
the m a z e was a k i t c h e n sink
variety using brass levers to direct
itself along the maze. T h e owner
will receive 81,000.
F r e d (complete with flashing
red eyes) and Midnight Sun, a
mouse built by Finnish students,
tied for the virtuoso performance.
F r e d g a v e a s o n g a n d d a n c e
routine while Midnight S u n wrote
his name. It is interesting to note
that when Fred failed to complete
the m a z e e a r l i e r , his o w n e r s
c o m p l a i n e d that he h a d b e e n
overworked by Blue Peter. Yet the
only mouse featured on Blue Peter
on Thursday was Midnight Sun.
Most of the mice did not have
m o u s e - l i k e e x t e r i o r s a n d it is
perhaps a pity that this element
was not considered lor a special
prize. W e feel the A m c o m i c a l
would surely have won.
Home Office
aid student refugees
F O L L O W I N G m a n y years of
campaigning by refugee agencies,
the Department of Education has
r u l e d t h a t r e f u g e e s l i v i n g i n
B r i t a i n will be entitled to the
same student award benefits as
home students, rather than having
to pay the full overseas students
fees. M a n y points are left unclear
by the decision, such as whether
the research councils will follow
suit with postgraduate grants; and
a n u m b e r o f refugees a r e not
e l i g i b l e u n d e r the new r a t i n g
(those, for example, w h o have
a p p l i e d f o r a s y l u m a n d a r e
waiting for a Home Office decision;
this can take up to two years).
However, the decision is to be
w e l c o m e d as b e i n g a m a j o r
breakthrough. Whether the L E A s
will act quickly enough to enable
refugees to take u p places this
year remains to be seen.
Inland Revenue
screw up Sabbaticals
T H E U N I O N has been informed
by the Inland Revenue that U n i o n
Sabbaticals should p a y tax on
their grants. T h e y c l a i m that
sabbaticals are 'employed' and as
such are taxable under Schedule
E ( s e c t i o n 181, I n c o m e a n d
Corporation Taxes Act, 1970).
T h e matter is to be raised by
John Passmore at Council, which
has already agreed, in principle,
to make up the Sabbaticals' grant
to its former level in the event of
such a situation occuring.
Phil the Greek
slags off vets at IC
T H E D U K E of Edinburgh visited
the College on 4th September to
s p e a k to t h e B r i t i s h E q u i n e
Veterinary Association ( B E V A )
which was holding its conference
in the Sherfield Building.
T w o days earlier, Princess Anne
had spoken to the vets, but the
Duke's opposition to the proposed
ban on the use of painkillers on
horses d u r i n g c o m p e t i t i o n p r o -
voked controversy.
T h e International Equestrian
F e d e r a t i o n p l a n s to b a n a l l
p a i n k i l l i n g d r u g s this y e a r as
dosages have been abused in the
past to keep the horse going right
to the end of a three-day event
when it should really have been
withdrawn due to exhaustion.
T h e Duke is against abuse of the
drugs, but is strongly in favour of
them being used under controlled
conditions. T h e Duke said that if
use of drugs was outlawed, some
r i d e r s m i g h t s t i l l s t r e t c h a n
exhausted horse out to three days,
but w i t h o u t w h a t is p r e s e n t l y
regarded as 'a properly prescribed
dose' o f p a i n k i l l e r for fear o f
disqualification.

Police
ignore IC
after trophies
stolen
However, the police at Gerald
R o a d Police Station seem content
to totally ignore I C and appear to
have disregarded College security's
suggestion. T h e police officer who
is in charge of the case said that
he w o u l d be back for 'further
investigations' a little later, but
has not been seen by the U n i o n
since 29th July.
John Passmore ( I C U President)
has just been given permission by
the police to appeal for information
concerning the whereabouts of the
trophies. College security believe it is
futile as the cups are so identifiable as
belonging to I C that no one would
risk attempting to sell them — and
molten pewter doesn't have a very
high market price. They believe the
cups are probably at the bottom of
the Thames by now.
If, however, you do have any
information, you should contact M r
Burroughs in the College Security
Office (int 2741). If you wish to see
the complete list of trophies stolen
you should contact the F E L I X or
U n i o n Office.
Bill gets his gong
M R B I L L W E S T , a C o l l e g e
m a i n t e n a n c e o p e r a t i v e , w a s
recently decorated by the Polish
G o v e r n m e n t i n E x i l e f o r h i s
"outstanding action" during the
last war. M r West w h o is the
Pearly K i n g of Kensington and
Chelsea, was reluctant to tell us
what action merits the 'Cross of
Freedom and Independence, with
swords' but did sav that his son is
Pearlv K i n g of Milton Kevnes.
W e l l ' d o n e Bill!
Safety Council
C A P T A I N Lindley has recently
been appointed Chairman of the
College Safety Council. H e replaces
D r D H Napier of C h e m E n g
who has left to go to the University
of Toronto.
Miserable failures
G L I I L D S is faced with an uneasy
start to the year as their President,
M r Pat Leggett, has failed his
metallurgy exams.
T h e Guilds H J T . Frank Rowsell,
has also failed.
R C S and Mines survived the
examiners axe but I C U is without
an External Affairs Officer as M r
Chris W e b b failed his C h e m E n g
course.
W e at F E L I X suffered t h e
tragic loss of one our most enthu-
siastic photographers, M r Mickie
Marsh, who is currently making
yogurt and preserving fruit back
home. Mickie, who spent his entire
exam period photographing the
Iranian Embassy Siege, intends to
retake his exams next year.
