Fencing
W E L C O M E to Imperial College
and all its excellent opportunities.
We at the I C F C can offer you
not only first class coaching at all
levels, from Prof A Moldavanyi,
but also a full range of equipment
in all three weapons. We have our
o w n ' e l e c t r i c b o x ' w h i c h we
encourage all interested members to
use (know what you mean squire -
Ed). O f c o u r s e the c h a n g i n g

believe us after two hours of hard
work you'll want one! W e meet
on Thursdays at 12:30pm in the
U n i o n G y m which, incidentally
has just had a new floor laid.
This year our main aim will be
to i m p r o v e l i n k s w i t h o t h e r
L o n d o n colleges. E s t a b l i s h i n g
links with n a t i o n a l universities
will also be investigated.
Fencing is an exacting sport,
r e q u i r i n g a great deal of self-
discipline especially in the early
stages of learning, but we hope
that in the sociable club atmosphere
you will find it an enjoyable and
stimulating sport. C o m e and see
us at the Freshers' Fair. We'll be
delighted to see you. If you miss
us there, try contacting one of us
for more information: Pat Coleman,
P h y s i c s P G ( C a p t a i n ) ; D a v e
Musker, M a t Sci 2 (Treasurer); or
Phil Bird, Elec E n g 2 (Secretary).

Hockey
F O L L O W I N G a highly successful
season last year, this session we
intend to i m p r o v e the a l r e a d y
h i g h r e p u t a t i o n of I m p e r i a l
College Hockey C l u b . T h e standard
of the four teams regularly playing
on S a t u r d a y afternoons varies
from the 1st X I playing league
games twice weekly with training
every Tuesday (indeed all C l u b
m e m b e r s are e n c o u r a g e d to
attend these sessions) through to
the 4 t h X I whose games are
played in a more social atmosphere.
This season for the first time
the 2nd X I will be playing in a
league and this will increase the
opportunity for players to play
league hockey.
T h e C l u b has the use of sporting
facilities at Hariington, to which
coaches are provided, leaving the
U n i o n Archway. These facilities
consist of four excellent pitches,
good changing facilities and a bar
for P O S T - m a t c h refreshment.
T h i s season, n u m e r o u s social
events have been arranged, such
as Pies & M a s h , D i n n e r , a n d
Pizza-Night; it is hoped that with
suitable support these will become
regular events.
Anyone interested should come
along to our stall at Freshers' Fair
or report with your kit on Wednes-
day or S a t u r d a y l u n c h t i m e s at
1 : 0 0 p m i n the U n i o n L o w e r
Lounge; ask for Pete Hughes.
Mixed Hockey
D U R I N G r e c e n t s e a s o n s the
M i x e d Hockey side has had few
games due to inclement weather
and a shortage of lady players.
This season however with some
fine fixtures arranged we hope to
be playing more often.
These matches on Sundays are
of a sociable nature against teams
such as Guinness (with laid on
supplies of stock), Bank of England
(without similar free gifts) and it
is hoped two tournaments — the
Worthing Penguin Weekend and
another still being arranged.
It is hoped this year to provide
transport to all venues by either
car or minibus.
Interested? T h e n contact either
Phil W e b b or Cathy Crossley at
Freshers' Fair.
Waterpolo Club piss
all over opposition
O N 21st June the I C Water Polo
C l u b set off on it's yearly tour of
Dorset. It was a cold grey Saturday
m o r n i n g as two vans a n d one
moped headed south-west. After
almost half of the journey had
been c o m p l e t e d we stopped at
Lymington to play our first match
of the tour against L y m i n g t o n
Swimming C l u b . T h e match was
to take place in an, open air sea-
water pool, however the opposition
refused to play, because: a) the
water was too cold; b) it started
raining heavily; and c) there was
not e n o u g h water in the p o o l
because the pump had failed.
Nevertheless the m a t c h took
place at New M i l t o n Swimming
. P o o l . P h i l M i l l s a n d B a r r y ,
s c o r e d t w o g o a l s i n the first
quarter and Nick Buckland scored
the third goal as his farewell present
to the club. However Lymington
fought back and equalised in the
third quarter and at the same time
J i m Williams was the first IC player
to be sent off during the tour. Phil
Thwaites scored two more goals in
the final quarter, so we won our first
match 5-3.
We stayed at the Sandy Holmes
Caravan Site outside Weymouth.
We played our second match, the
most difficult, on Tuesday against
Bournemouth City. T h e score at
the end of the first quarter was 2-
2, Steve Taylor and Phil Mills
scoring two goals. In the second
quarter Cliff Spooner scored two
goals (one from a penalty). Barry
scored another one and our goalie
Dave saved a penalty. Therefore
we established a good lead over,
our o p p o s i t i o n a n d they never
m a n a g e d to catch u p with us.
Phill Mills and Cliff scored two
more goals and the final score was
7-5 to us.
T h e third match was held at
Bovington A r m y C a m p against
the J u n i o r Leaders. T h e i r team
was r a t h e r i n e x p e r i e n c e d a n d
D i m i t r i , P a t , N i c k L a s t , P h i l
S i n c l a i r a n d J o h n H e e f e r s o n
s c o r e d f i v e g o a l s i n t h e f i r s t
quarter. D u r i n g the rest of the
game our scoring slowed down,
however J i m Williams scored a
goal after putting a great deal of
effort. T h e final score was 9-4 to
us.
O n Thursday we had our final
game against Bridport S C at West
B a y . W e p l a y e d i n the r i v e r ,
which was extremely cold. Phil
Mills and Phil Thwaites scored a
hat-trick each and Barry scored
the seventh. Final score 7-2 to I C .
T h e whole tour was a resounding
success, both in the pool and out.
We kept up the excellent reputation
of the C l u b and the college by not
losing a match.
T h e team was: J i m Williams,
C l i f f S p o o n e r , P h i l M i l l s , N i c k
Buckland, Phil Thwaites, Dimitri
Papaconstantinou, Dave Roberts,
Pat P o r t e r , B a r r y A s w i n . N i c k

Results Service
FELIX would dearly love to provide an efficient results service for its
sports m a d readers. T h i s relies o n all club captains (or equivalents)
bringing in results of Saturday games by 5:30pm Monday and
W e d n e s d a y games by W e d n e s d a y (yes, the s a m e day!). Y o u r
cooperation would be appreciated.
If there is insufficient response we shall brand y o u all as w a n k e r s a n d
drop the sports page which the Editor hates anyway.

Canoe
T H E C L U B is looking forward to
another good season. Last year we
had river trips to the Wye, U s k
Fifey and Dart and four surfing
weekends in Cornwall. T h e summer
tour to the French Alps was also
successful, although some of our
canoes didn't like the rocks.
We can cater for all abilities, so
even if you're a complete novice
don't be afraid to come along and
see us at Freshers' Fair or at the
s w i m m i n g pool at 6 : 3 0 p m a n y
Tuesday.
