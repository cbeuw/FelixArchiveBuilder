G a r y N u m a n wrote two of the tracks and
appears on one.
T h e album starts with 'Looking For Clues',
an upbeat tune that combines Palmer's voice
with some fairly funky electronic backing.

Robert Palmer rock and roll song. W e are
then treated to the rose among the thorns:
'Johnny and Mary'. A n excellent track by
anyone's standards, and also a good single.
After that the album is basically not worth
listening to, apart from perhaps ' W o k e U p

probably the most boring.
Robert Palmer with this album has tried to
keep up with the times, but apart from the
one track, 'Johnny and Mary', which is a
classic, he has failed.

IN T H E past Yes have had the knack of
p r o d u c i n g a l b u m s w h i c h s o u n d e d a l m o s t
exactly like all of their predecessors, but still
selling millions of them. That was the Yes
with J o n Anderson as lead vocalist, and for
the m o s t p a r t w i t h R i c k W a k e m a n o n
keyboards. However, Yes have changed and
p e r h a p s the new g r o u p s h o u l d really be
called Yuggles. Geoff Downes and Trevor
H o r n , the m a s t e r m i n d s b e h i n d B u g g i e s ,
stepped in to replace Messrs W a k e m a n and
A n d e r s o n and most, including myself, were
e x p e c t i n g a n e w s o u n d i n g Y e s . T o o u r
surprise and perhaps disappointment, Yes
sound the same today as they ever did.
T h e album Drama consists of a mere six
tracks, and even then one of them is less
than three minutes long. T h e opening track,
'Machine Messiah', reminds me a lot of some
parts of Floyd's Wish You Were Here. 'Does
It Really H a p p e n ' is the other major track on
side one. It's a typical fast moving Yes track,
which has some nice touches on keyboards
w h i c h p o s s i b l y a r e the b e s t W a k e m a n
impersonations I have heard.
The album has several good and several
bad points. T h e production is excellent and
the m u s i c is g e n e r a l l y q u i t e a c c e s s i b l e .
However the lyrics are still very bland and
despite a considerable effort, Trevor Horn's
vocals are not quite of the same calibre of
Anderson. T h e album cover, itself a work of
art, is taken yet again from a Roger D e a n
painting. All in all the package looks like
a n o t h e r Y e s a l b u m . M e s s r s D o w n e s a n d
H o r n have been integrated totally and Yes
have p r o d u c e d an a l b u m that will please
many a Y e

One Trick Pony - Paul Simon
Warner Bros — K56846
IT H A S been five years since Paul Simon
released his last original album, Still Crazy
After All These Years, a n d it was with
interest I listened to this, his first album on
Warner Bros. T h e songs were written in 1978/9
for a film ' O n e Trick Pony', which stars Paul
Simon. In the five years since his last release,
Simon's musical style has barely changed.

What the Swedish Butler Saw
(Cineccnta)
T H E P U B L I C I T Y claims that this is the first
3 - D p o r n o film e v e r m a d e , a n d to m y
knowledge, which, in these matters, is not
extensive, it is.
A t £3.20 a go, including the disposable (not
to be used twice, etc. . . ) 3-D glasses, the
film is hardly recommendable.
T o be blunt, the film is not only unerotic,
but the d i r e c t o r , it s e e m s , a l m o s t totally
forgot he was filming in three dimensions. In
fact, save sixty seconds of dreaming by 'our
hero' when naked ladies were seen swimming
out of the screen, with arms and legs flailing,
on a black background, my expectations of
the use of three dimensional photography to
complement the standard 'sex' movie went
sadly unfulfilled.
S e t in a n E d w a r d i a n c l i m a t e , the film
outlines the progress to sexual competence
a n d fulfilment of ' o u r h e r o ' . T h e s e x u a l
competence bit is attained in Diana D o r s '
b r o t h e l (yes I'm s o r r y ! ) , t h o u g h he finds
there is still something missing, 'a thing called
love'. T h e answer to this, apparently, is to
forcibly rape, using all the electrical mod-
cons at your disposal, the first demure and
respectable young lady you meet. In this case,
the demure and respectable young lady is
some girl he meets in the National Gallery,
a n d all t h e e l e c t r i c a l m o d - c o n s at h i s
disposal, is a room, unfortunately named the
'snuggery', with such devices as a Chinese
tickler (a hand-wound device with a feather
on the end which could be directed a n y w h e r e . .
. . .), the world's first, though I'm sure there
are many now, electrically operated pulsating
f l o u r e s c e n t d i l d o a n d a v e r y d e v i o u s
e x a m i n a t i o n c o u c h . N e e d l e s s to s a y ,
together with too m u c h ill-conceived comedy,
O n e Trick Pony is a very mellow album, that
will probably go down best late at night.
If you like the Paul Simon laid back style,
then this is an album for you. These songs

However, if you are a newcomer to Paul.
Simon's solo work then I would not recommend
it as it is t o o l a i d b a c k a n d it l a c k s
immediacy.

he has his wicked way with her only to find
that she's the sexual athlete, not him.
T h e Swedish Butler comes straight from
the Muppet Show and his main role, other
than keeping what's-her-name's chaperone
b u s y in the k i t c h e n ( w a t c h for the awful
vegetable insinuations), is to add the word
Swedish and all it's connotations to the title.

A n d now the glowing report
F I N A L L Y I made it, my ambition to mix my first
3-D movie with my weekly porno film, and I
was not disappointed.
A t 30p, the snug fitting glasses were a
good bargain, and we were allowed to keep
t h e m a n d t h o u g h we w e r e i n f o r m e d that
they were not sunglasses, 1 a m sure I can put
them to good use.
T h e d i r e c t o r not only u s e d the three
dimensional effects beautifully, but continued
to use his delicious models in a way that was
both subtle and erotic.
It was good to see Diana D o r s , still looking as
ravishing as ever, playing the part of the
brothel 'madame' and treating 'our hero' and
us to all sorts of exciting positions from the
K a m a Sutra.
T h e main plot, however, revolved around
the stud trying to seduce a stunning beautiful
virginal maiden he met, quite by chance, in
the National Gallery.

numerous electric devices, serving only to
whet our appetite, we were treated to her
marvellous body, as she stood strapped to
the wall!
Though I could write on for hours, I think I
should leave it to y o u to experience this
delightful adventure.

The Discreet Charm
of the Bourgeoisie
Showing at the Minema, Knightsbridge, until
October 15th, this film is an excellent example
of the work of the French director Luis Bunuel.
Brilliantly funny, the film offers a satirical,
slightly surrealistic view of the lives of a select
group of rich friends, plotting their course from
dinner party to dinner party through such
incidents as their arrest for drug smuggling and
the invasion of their house by the army on
manoeuvres. The film is funny, intriguing, and
superb entertainment, and is highly recommen-
ded by the editor and reviews staff.
