"Hello, good evening, and "
I suppose I'd better extend a warm welcome
to all you freshers or I'll loose my street
credibility right from day one. (That was it,
incidentally)
You're now reading FELIX, one of the best
student newspapers in the country. I was
elected last year, along with L i z , Rae, and
John, to edit it for this session. Unlike some
college papers, F E L I X is not constitutionally
b o u n d to tow the party line. F E L I X can
criticize as well as praise Union policy. The
idea of press freedom is actively encouraged
by both the College and the Union, although
in individual cases, some people have wished
that they c o u l d restrain F E L I X to some
extent. T h e F E L I X motto sums it all up:
'Keep The Cat Free'.
This year's ICU Handbook
I would like to congratulate Dave Crabbe on
p r o d u c i n g u n d o u b t e d l y the best U n i o n
Handbook that I C U has seen. His coverage
of c l u b s a n d f r e s h l y w r i t t e n p u b - g u i d e
articles, etc, has taken away the usual task
of the F E L I X Editor of re-doing them for
Freshers' FELIX.
Most (but not all) of the clubs featured are
the ones who couldn't be bothered to submit
an article for the Handbook. After spending
many, many hours pasting all this up I can
only express my admiration for Dave Crabbe
for s t i c k i n g to it for 72 pages a n d m y
contempt for these clubs. In retrospect, I
should have chucked all of their offerings in
the bin. I hope next year's F E L I X Editor will
h e e d m y w o r d s a n d b l a c k l i s t c l u b s not
bothering to submit to the Handbook.
The Anti-Aparteid Bit
It is a pity that Dave should have marred
his Handbook by including the article entitled
"The Don't Bank with Barclays bit" on p69.
T h i s is nothing but an unfair attack on
Barclays Bank. While most people disagree
with apartheid, I feel that at a time when
b a n k s are c o m p e t i n g for c u s t o m e r s by
placing advertisements which help, in turn,
to fund the production of the Handbook, it is
certainly not right to attack one particular
bank in such a way.
Barclays has been attacked by extreme
factions in many colleges throughout the
country, but it may interest you to know that
they still r e t a i n a h i g h e r p r o p o r t i o n of
student accounts than any other bank.
It is illogical to single out Barclays, for
while it is certainly true that they do fund
projects in South Africa, A L L of the other
major banks hold accounts with Barclays
International.
To end my outburst on this topic, I would
like to stab a few IC Anti-apartheid Group
freaks in the back: Y o u might be interested
to learn that M r Derryck Everett, a former
Deputy President, and chief exponent of the
'Let's stop the Boat Club going to South
Africa' bandwagon does indeed bank with
Barclays. When I questioned him about his
hypocritical view on life he confessed that he
was 'somewhat embarrassed' by it but had
formed his strong anti-aparteid views after
he had got a bank account. It was too much
trouble for him to change now, yet standing
up at U G M ' s and slagging off the Boat Club
(very eloquently, I might add) seems little
effort.
And what about Aftab Gujral? He figures
prominently in the Anti-Aparteid Group and
banks with Barclays. However, he seems to
have his head screwed on the right way as
while condemning aparteid, he realises that
it doesn't matter which bank you have your
account with as they've all got South African
c o n n e c t i o n s . If t h e y c a n ' t e v e n a g r e e
a m o n g s t t h e m s e l v e s w h y s h o u l d we be
subjected to their ramblings with the possible
risk of loosing valuable advertising revenue
for Union publications. I will not accept these
smear campaigns in FELIX.
Anti-apartheid Group at IC has done more
for the cause of anti-anti-apartheid than its
intended aim. A pity.
People who got on my tits this week
You may see a copy of the Liberal Club
newspaper Forward around College today.
Its headlines are constructed with letraset
stolen from the F E L I X Office after these
Liberal bum-boys were adamantly told that
they couldn't use it.
I shall be sending them an extortionate bill
for materials and if they don't pay it, I shan't
bother too much about including any of their
articles in F E L I X .

Security overtime ban
College security guards and messengers have
implemented an overtime ban due to the
breakdown in talks with College over revised
rates of pay.
O v e r the past m o n t h , the n u m b e r of
messengers and security guards have been
reduced; the complaint is that College are
trying to impose new manning levels on them
without settling pay first.
T h e last N U P E U n i o n meeting was on
Wednesday, 24th April. This was a result of
the messengers a n d guards calling off a
previous overtime ban due to start on 22nd
September after College promised further
talks.
H o w e v e r , M r D a v i d s o n , the personnel
secretary, failed to turn up for this meeting
and the U n i o n e x e c u t i v e s were m e r e l y
presented with a list of manning levels to be
worked with the reduced staff. It was then
decided to impose the overtime ban.
Confusion was caused in College depart-
ments as the N U P E circular read: " A work
to rule by all messengers will start at 7am on
S a t u r d a y , 2 7 t h S e p t e m b e r , 1980. U n t i l
further notice". In actual fact, a work to rule
was voted down in favour of the overtime
ban. In the Beit/Union building this means
that there will be no messenger from 7am to
9am, with erratic manning at weekends.
