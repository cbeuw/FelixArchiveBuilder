The long, cold winter.
jr "Tnlike anarchism, higher educa-
I tion takes action in winter.
During this term there will be
far reaching changes as the cash runs
out. Honorable traditions of free edu-
cation and well funded universities
have withered and died. Students will
voice then: discontent at the universi-
ties and the universities may call strikes
to protest against the government. So
where did the trouble start?
Students lose out.
Until 1994. student grants had been
frozen (effectively a drop of 3-5% per
year), and the difference was made up
with a student loan. However, policy
changed and the grant started to tum-
ble. This year the two are equal (See
graph). Little action has been taken,
partly because the body supposed to
represent students, the NUS, was in
disarray. The NUS insisted that grants
and benefits be restored to 1979 levels
- a demand impossible for the govern-
ment to fulfill.
Universities lose out.
The money handed out to universi-
aithough increasing, was not suffi-
cient to cover rising student numbers.
Last year Imperial College effectively
had it's entire budget cut by 0.7%.
Worse still, the funding body Higher-
Education Rinding Council for
England warned that the grant would be
frozen in 1998. However,fewpeople were
prepared for the drastic action the govern-
ment was to take in the November bud-
get.
Government go too far?
Kenneth Clarke revealed in his 1995
budget that capital funding (ie. funding for
buildings and resources) would be cut by
31% for 1996 and 63% by 199S. This
represents a loss of £2 million for Imperial
College alone! £500 less funding for every
student.
The missing money had been trans-
ferred to junior and secondary schools,
and the education minister claimed that
the shortfall could be made upfrompri-
vate investment. For many universities.
University heads take action.
The council of Vice Chancellors and
Principles (CVCP) met to decide what
action to take. The funding shortfall had
to be made upfromsomewhere, or stan-
dards could not be rnaintained. so they
decided to threaten the government with
the introduction of top-up fees. These are
charges charged directly to the student by
their college. This plan ended any hope of
continued free education.
As expected, the Cabinet was swift to
Day
respond, voicing strong opposition to top-
up fees. What they advised instead was to
reduce student intake - the exact opposite
of the policy so far. The Conservative
party, who had been 'committed' tc
increasing student population, reversed
their decision when just 30% of the target
They also reminded universities that
they would be fined if their intake
chopped below the agreed minimum.
Unimpressed with the inaction of the
NUS, many university union presidents
collaborated to form a pressure group
known as the Aldwych Group. They sent
formal complaints to the CVCP and
attempted to organise a national day of
Student Loans Company kicked
The SLC had been a real black eye for
the government - allegations of corrup-
tion, poor management and bad debt
repayment were big problems - even
though just 40% of eligible student took
out their loan. Plans to privatise the gov-
ernment body were in trouble - no one
was interested in investing in a company
that is guaranteed to lose money. Tire 'big

In February 1996, IC's Pro-Rector Alan
Swanson revealed that top-up fees were
under consideration. These could prove
devastating to the students - around £1000
make a significant difference: money that
could not be afforded by students. Prof
Swanson answered these claims of discrimi-
nation against poorer families b

that the American system where well off
families pay more and poorer students
