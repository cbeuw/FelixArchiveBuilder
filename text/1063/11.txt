Welcome to the new year, and our
first issue. You will have hopefully
picked up the new Felix supple-
ment, Something for the Weekend,
which should come out each week
alongside Felix. Don't forget to
pick it up. It will contain all the
listings and reviews and features
that used to appear in Felix. Hope
you like it.
It has been a summer full of
upheavals, both in the local envi-
ronment around the campus and
in wider terms concerning student
and Higher Education funding.
There is enough building work
going on around SW7 to save Ove
Arup from bankruptcy. Everyone
is getting Millennium fever. I just
hope that everything will be fin-
ished in time.
Which brings me to dBs, the
Union's new venue. It looks great,
a massive improvement. The
refurbishment involved a lot of
structural work, which was very
nearly late and certainly had a
wider effect than perhaps was
intended. I shall say nothing other
than "thank-you" to the college
electricans who restored power to
our collating machine in the nick of
time.
Moving from the physical to the
fiscal, education funding is yet
again in the news. The CVCP's
decision to try and make up their
funding shortfall from students is
fraught with dangers, and could be
interpreted by the more cynical as
a shot across the bows of the
Government.
One would hope that students
wouldn't be caught between the
universities and the Treasury in a
battle over funding. Students have
their own, admittedly related,
problems with money and are
increasingly suffering from finan-
cial difficulties.
If the massive turn-out at the
Union's recent training day for
part-time staff is anything to go by,
then for students, there are indeed
grim days ahead.

Careers planning advice
Dear Fresher,
Welcome to Imperial College. The
next three or four years should be
among the most interesting and
enjoyable of your life, provided
you make the most of the opportu-
nities available at College. This let-
ter aims to give you some idea for
your own self-development.
You can probably recall one of
the significant steps in your life
when you entered the sixth form or
went to sixth form college. Coming
to College is an even more signifi-
cant step. You have more freedom,
more independence and more
opportunities to do our own thing
and to succeed or fail. If you do not
make some mistakes you will not
have learned anything, learning
from one's own mistakes is an
important part of experience.
You have already demonstrated
some planning ability by passing
'A' levels - or their equivalent -
sufficiently well to be at College.
How are you going to plan the next
three, four or six years? And I'm
not talking just about your acade-
mic studies, I'm talking about the
start of the rest of your life.
What do you want to achieve
this term? Making friends is usual-
ly high on most people's list. How?
Join clubs and societies, attend
meetings, take up a new sport,
develop a new interest - any of
these are likely to bring you into
contact with like minded students.
How about earning some good
money in the long vacation? It's
well worthwhile doing some pre-
liminary job hunting between
Christmas and Easter. Call in at
the IC Careers Service (Room 310,
Sherfield Building) where you will
find information about Vacation
Training, write to employers with
your CV, call in to some local
shops and hotels and see who's
advertising in the local press.
Vac jobs give you experience in
job hunting, letter writing and
interviews, as well as a real insight
into what it's like to work for a
particular type of employer. Some
even pay you quite well. Jobs
abroad are popular and early
applications are essential.
You should start thinking seri-
ously about your future career
before the end of the second year.
Even if you haven't a clue what
you want to do, that's no excuse for
delayingfindingout about the pos-
sibilities. You are surrounded with
sources of information - friends,
family, tutors, careers advisers,
libraries. Start looking.
The IC Careers Service is a good
starting place. Pop in and speak to
the information staff. Find out
about "PROSPECT (HE)" - our
computer careers guidance system
- and all the information booklets
and referencefiles.Have a look at
some of the videos, attend some
seminars on careers, get yourself
sorted out.
The Milkround is in the spring
term of your final year. This is
when employers visit campuses to
interview applicants or invite you
to their London Offices
Christmas vacation courses are
a popular way offindingout about
careers such as marketing but only
a few major recruiters run them
and they are normally over-sub-
scribed many times.
You may be thinking "Stop! I'm
only a fresher - why are you telling
me all this?"
I'm telling you because you need
to start planning your life now,
don't just drift through College
and merge with a degree and
nothing else. Of course a degree is
important and must be your first
priority, but not your only priority.
In the meantime, enjoy yourself.
John Simpson, Director, IC
Careers Service
