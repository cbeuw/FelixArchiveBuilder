ROBIN RILEY
The lives of IC students were endan-
gered yesterday during a potentially
fatal roof collapse outside the main
library.
At almost exactly 4pm, the ceiling
which overhangs the library's front
entrance came away, falling some 3
metres onto the walkway below. The
concrete and steel section, measuring
5 by 6 meters and weighing an esti-
mated 4 tons, missed a workman and
a female student leaving the library
"by literally three inches" according
to one eyewitness. "It would defi-
nitely have killed anyone underneath
it." said another.
Within a few minutes, site man-
agers from both IC Estates and Schal
Project management had arrived at
the scene, and hastily organised a
team of workmen to remove the shat-
tered ribbon-lathe construction.
Efforts to bring in further equipment,
and to isolate the scene of the inci-
dent, were hampered by the arrival of
several dozen onlookers.
Eventually seven men were
together able to roll the huge roof
section up into a cylinder, ready for
its subsequent removal.
Mr Ian Gillet, a College safety rep-
resentative, was one of the few site
managers present willing to speak to
Felix. Speaking under strain soon
after the incident, he admitted "I
have no explanation at this time.
Clearly there will be a full investiga-
tion... I have notified the Health and
Safety directorate, and Ian Caldwell
is on his way." Mr Gillet went on to
confirm that to the best of his knowl-
edge no-one had been injured, but
nervously joked that someone had
"felt a draught down the back of his
neck as it fell."
At the time of going to press, secu-
rity officials had established a wide
cordon around the site of the collapse
and a mini-digger was being
employed to clear away the debris.
The reason for the collapse is
unclear, and is likely to remain so
until the completion of the site engi-
neers' investigations. If the ceiling
was not being worked on directly at
the time of the accident, then the fail-
ure must have been caused by the
alterations being carried out else-
where in the building, namely the
addition of two extra floors on the
top of the library. It is also unclear
why students were permitted to walk
beneath the ceiling if it was unsafe.
This is the first major accident
since the beginning of construction
works on the library extension and
the BMS building. Occurring as
early as it does within IC's proposed
ten-year "Campus renaissance," due
be completed in 2007, this incident
raises serious questions as to whether
safety can be maintained when
crowded construction projects over-
lap or face tight schedules.
This accident must be considered a
lucky escape, not only for those
involved but also for the officials
administrating the works.

Ents Lounge transformed
The Union Building summer refur-
bishment came to conclusion this
week with the opening of the new
entertainments lounge, dBs. The
Â£0.1M project was just completed in
time, despite last minute finishing
and system testing on Friday morn-
ing.
The previous incarnation of the
lounge, a dull and dingy room paint-
ed dark blue, had been on the
Union's 'must-do' list for some time.
"It was like a Sixth Form Disco,"
commented ICU's Events and
Marketing Manager, Mark Home. "It
was a real dump. We had problems
with bands not being able to fit all
their equipment in, and the visibilty
was appalling." The new look venue,
renamed 'dBs', received high praise
from returning students, most
remarking that it was a significant
improvement.
Plans for the refurbishment were
drawn up by the Union in liason with
Mary Marsh and Alan Spehnjak
from the College CAD Office. The
new disco set up got the thumbs up
from passers by, but one commented
:

that the room was "a bit primary" in
its decor.
Funding for the work was taken
from the Union's Strategic
Development Reserve, a pool of
money set aside from profits made
by the Union's bars and the
Bookstore. This is the first such pro-
ject to use the reserve since it was set
up two years ago. Other projects in
the pipeline include a Clubs and
Societies Resource Centre and a
refurbishment of the Union Office.

In a summer devoid of much inci-

ground saw more than its fair share
of drama. August saw an invasion of
