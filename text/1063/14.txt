Imperial College Boat Club and its
alumni rowing club, Queen's Tower,
won British rowing's premier event
when they carried off the Grand
Challenge Cup at this year's Henley
Royal Regatta.
The Grand win, the first ever in the
club's history, was the highlight of
the 1996 regatta. To win, the crew
had to beat two national lightweight
eights - Germany and Holland, (the
German team went on to take gold at
the World Championships in
Strathclyde, Scotland). The Saturday
race against the Germans was more
nerve wracking for the crew, as crew
member Martin Kettle explained:
"We've been nervous all week, but
we got it right off the start and used
our extra weight really well. We had
a crew push at the barrier (the first
distance marker on the course) and
took another length."
By the finish IC and QT had three
and a half lengths. In the final the
crew had the same the same explo-
sive start and slipped quickly away
from the Dutch, opening up clear
water and making their point by
returning the fastest time of the regat-
ta at the finish. The crew contained
IC students Richard Dunn, Pete
Wilson, Simon Dennis, Louis Attrill,
Luka Grubor, with Jim Goodwin at
the helm. This unit was backed up by
the experience of QT members
Simon Wall, Martin Kettle and
David Gillard.
This crew's Henley win was
Martin MacElroy's second win as
coach in as many years. Charing
Cross Medic Simon Wall summed
up MacElroy's contribution: "There
was a lot of strength and experience
in the crew, but Martin focused the
power. The Grand was his dream,
and he made it a reality."
The Grand eight were joined by
three other IC/QT crews on finals

day - the most entries of any club.
The Wyfold cup was won by
Queen's Tower, who came from
behind to beat a polished Molesey
Crew by three quarters of a length.
The agony of the defeat was too
much for the Molesey bowman who
fell out of the boar at the end of the
race, completely exhausted.
The Temple Challenge Cup, for
college and university eights, had its
entry requirements toughened this
year, in an attempt to prevent
Imperial College and Oxford
Brookes teams from dominating the
event. However, the IC crew over-
came stiff opposition from the
University of London's freshman
crew, who had already been selected
amidst controversy as the Great
Britain representatives for the Under
23 World Championships. By the
time the crews had finished, the
selectors may have been pondering
the wisdom of their earlier judge-
ment - the IC crew beat UL by three
quarters of a length to take them into
the final.
The final of the Temple was
against an undefeated Yale
University USA freshmen crew.
Yale had looked strong all week
from off the start and once more led
from the beginning, never letting IC
back into the race despite a deter-
mined last charge along the enclo-
sures. The morning showdown
against UL had clearly taken its toll.
However, many of the young crew
will be back this year, and will build
and capitalise on their great progress
last year.
The fourth Imperial College crew
to race on Sunday, a composite quad
sculls crew with Leander, were beat-
en in the semi finals of the Mother
Cup by their counterparts, the
German Under 23 quad.
IC team win gold
for Britain at World
Championships
At the Under 23 World Champion-
ships, held in Belgium a week after
Henley, an all IC coxless four, con-
taining three winners from the grand
eight, refocussed their efforts under
the guidance of Martin MacElroy.
Their commitment was rewarded in
a storming finish in their final to
snatch the gold medal by 0.04 of a
second from Romania.
The IC/Leander quad scull missed
qualification for their final in
Belgium by less than 1 second, after
a technical glitch with 500m to go.
They did however win their B final
convincingly, recording a time that
would have contested medals in the
A final.
