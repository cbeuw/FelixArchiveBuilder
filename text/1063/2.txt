2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 4TH OCTOBER
News in Brief
Evelyn Gardens
summer assault
Summer accomodation guests in
Evelyn Gardens nearly initiated an
international incident when they tan-
gled with a French IC student staying
in Hall. The circumstances around
the incident are not clear, though an
assault on a minor is believed to have
occured.
The guests, dancers in the annual
Royal Tournament at Earls Court,
had been staying in the Halls for a
week before Police were called in to
investigate allegations of an assault
on a young girl. The girl claimed that
she was struck by the student whilst
she was using the telephone.
When interviewed by the Police,
the student stated a number of com-
plaints against the dance troupe,
many of which were backed up by
other residents in the Halls. Local
residents too had been writing to the
College complaing of late night foot-
ball matches, loud discos, property
being covered with eggs and flour
and general rowdiness. Students
complained of food being stolen
from fridges, loud parties and gener-
al rudeness from the guests.
This particular incident started just
after midnight on the Friday when
the student was awoken by the girl
using the phone. He asked her to
keep it down, but received some ver-
bal abuse in return to which to stu-
dent responded by striking the girl.
However, later that night, adult
members of the dance group threat-
ened the student and assaulted him in
retaliation. Again the Police were
called, but did not take any action at
that time.
As the Police were involved, the
College stepped in to discipline the
student. Upon consultationwifh IC
Security and the Police, he escaped
with a strongly worded warning.
NEW SOLUTIONS
REFORMED
The pressure group New Solutions,
the brain-child of ex-ULU President
Ghassan Karrian, has been reformed
to fight the introduction of top-up
fees in British Universities. The
group originally convened to fight
the NUS policy for returning student
grants to 1979 levels.
ICU THE O N L Y BAR WITH
GUINNESS?
Imperial College Union could be the
only students' union in the country to
have Guinness on tap in their bar
after the NUS buying group, NUS
Services, failed to reach an agree-
ment with Guinness pic. ICU is unaf-
filiated to the NUS, and thus unaf-
fected by the move.
Stout drinkers in other universities
and colleges are being advised to
switched to Murphy's.
ROLLERBLADE-FREE
C A M P U S
Ken Weir, Head of Security, has
advised staff and students not allow
rollerbladers into College buildings.
The campus has been a popular site
for in-line skaters to attempt jumps
and blading down steps. However,
there have a been a few incidents of
people being hurt in collisions with
bladers. Mr Weir added that
Rollerblading is not allowed any-
where on campus, and students trav-
elling to College by blades are asked
to remove them before entering
buildings.
On a related note, Mr Weir called
for extra vigilance from those with
motorcycles, as there has been a
great deal of damage to motor bikes
over the summer. He suggests that
anybody seeing any damage on their
bike should report it immediately to
security.
M O N D E X G O - A H E A D FOR
EXETER
The University of Exeter has become
the first in Britain to introduce the
Mondex system of smart-card money
transfers and identity cards.
The scheme, backed by Nat West
will give students just one card for
Union membership, libary facilities,
access, voting, use in the campus
shops and can even be used as a
phonecard. The cards have been
introduced with support from all sec-
tors of Exeter's Uni-versity commu-
nity. Sir Geoffrey Holland, Vice-
Chancellor of Exeter University, said
that he was "intrigued by the possi-
bilities of the Mondex cashless
purse." Charlie Offer, Communi-
cations Officer of Exeter's Guild of
Students stated "We welcome the
new Mondex card and anticipate its
success. It is a welcome development
for students."
As an incentive for students at
Exeter, Nat West has charged each
card with Â£2 credit, and the bank
hopes to expand the scheme to other
Universities. Imperial College has
studied the Mondex system but in the
words of Estates Director Ian
Caldwell "we want to learn from
Exeter's experience."
C L A M P D O W N O N
C O M P U T E R MISUSE
Following a year full of computer
problems and computer misuse, stu-
dents are being advised not to abuse
the priviledges that they enjoy with
the College's computer network. The
handbook issued by the Centre for
Computer Services has the full list of
conditions and regulations regarding
computer use.
In a warning issued by the
College, students would face severe
disciplinary proceedings if the facili-
ties were misused. The warning goes
on to state several examples where
students, of both post-graduate and
undergraduate level have been
expelled from College for computer
misuse involving racial and sexual
abuse.

A U T U M N COLLECTION
The Haldane Librarian, Janet Smith,
has invited students to come and
investigate the Haldane Library's
Autumn collection of humanities and
music material. The Haldane
Collection occupies the same build-
ing as the main library. It has a wide
range of fiction and audio materials
as well as periodicals and daily
newspapers.
Each term, the collection is
expanded; recent additions to the
range include CDs and musical
scores. There is also a programme of
cultural events in store, which will be
publicised in Felix.
Eviction for travellers
camping at Harlington
In a summer deviod of much inci-
dent, Imperial College's sports
ground at Harlington saw more
than its fair share of drama.
August saw an invasion of the
sportsground by a group of thirty
traveller carvans. The southern
portion of the ground, where the
travellers camped, is currently
undergoing preparations for grav-
el extraction.
The southern half of the site,
just off the M4 motorway near .
Heathrow, has not been in use for .
a year while survey for the aggre- p
gate extraction was undetakni.
Fearing for the saftey of College
staff, on-site contractors and the
travellers themselves, the College
undertook to have the travellers
removed from the site.
By August 7th, a court order under
the High Court Rules Act was
obtained to evict the group. A few
days later bailiffs, supported by
Police, moved the travellers on. To
protect the northern half of the site,

groundsman's residence, a security
