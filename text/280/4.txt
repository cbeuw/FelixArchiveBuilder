Page 4 FELIX 29th September, 1969
F E L I X GOES TO PRESS . . .
From Press Meeting to
Born in a beery, smoky
hole, mishandled by illiterate
students. How does FELIX
ever reach the news-stands?
The work on the next issue
starts the day the previous
FELIX comes out when the
features pages are discussed
and any important news cov-
erage is discussed at the
lunch-time press meetings.
. . . Printers
The pages are set out on
layout sheets showing the
positions of articles, photos
and adverts and are sent
down in three batches. The
first three or more feature
pages are sent by special mes-
senger (G.P.O. for short) to
Bailey's, the printers, where
they are set up and the proofs
returned to college for check-
ing. The sports and letters
pages are normally sent down
next, on the Friday previous
to the issue date. The news
pages are laid out on the
Sunday and the proofs of the
pages already rolled off are
checked, c o r r e c t e d and
altered and most of the
photos are printed.
At Bailey's, the ideas and
creations of FELIX staff are
turned into harsh reality.
The type face used for
most work is 10 point Times,
and this, and other small
sized type, is set by linotype
machines as shown in the pic-
tures below. The large type
used for headings and sub-
headings is set letter by
letter by hand.
The photographic blocks
are cut by a machine which
reads the density of reflected
and transmitted light whilst
scanning the picture in lines.
It engraves an aluminium
plate reproducing the picture
in dots, which vary in density
according to the shades of
light on the photo.

It took about three minutes,
two pounds, and one
handshake to open an
account with Barclays.
The three minutes were mainly spent in writing a couple of
specimen signatures and in establishing my identity as a bona
fide student—my passport to a charge-free account. The two
pounds—all I could bank at that time—were received with a
cordial handshake and I was made to feel really welcome.
Nothing stuffy about Barclays. You don't believe me? Try 'em.

ABOVE LEFT: The pages of type, etc., are being set in
their frames for printing, in the background are some of the
linotype machines.
ABOVE RIGHT : Headings are set one letter at n time by
hand.
BELOW: Photos of linotype machines.
Each letter has its individual die (or matrix). These are
selected by the keyboard from the magazines at the top of
the machine. The words and spaces are assembled in a line.
This tops a mould into which is pumped a molten alloy of
lead, tin and antimony. The line is then trimmed and is
ejected onto the storage galley.
This photo details: the magazines at the top of -the machine.
These hold different sizes in of type in BOLD, ROMAN and
ITALIC. The storage galley containing some twelve lines
can be seen bottom left.
