IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 280 29th SEPTEMBER, 1969
Helen Aims High
Hits College
A smile from Helen as the first Banker's Order is signed
Last February five Oxford
students formed an organisa-
tion known as 3W1-Third
World First. Within 21 days
this organisation had encour-
aged 1000 students to sign
bankers orders to contribute
one, two, or three per cent of
their incomes towards the
alleviation of world poverty.
By the summer the movement
had spread with equal suc-
cess to 2 other universities.
Now 3W1 is starting up at
IC, where pretty Helen
Lewis-Jones aims to sign up
10% of IC students.
A vivacious blonde, Helen
graduated from Edinburgh
last session and is now em-
ployed by 3W1, who realised
that full-time workers would
be needed to maintain the
momentum gathered last ses-
sion.
In an exclusive interview
with Felix—see back page—
Helen told our reporter that
the average human being is
approximately 18 years old,
is illiterate, has a life expect-
ancy of 34 years, and exists
on insufficient food. The in-
crease is expenditure on
tobacco and drink in the past
2 years is, according to a
V.C.O.A.D. pamphlet, greater
than the total amount of
grant aid sent each year to
the developing countries.
Helen believes the solution
to these enormous problems
does not lie in the emotional
response of collecting tins or
pictures of swollen-bellied
children, but involves a
rational decision of commit-
ment and education. This is
why 3W1 concentrates on the
use of Banker's Orders and
will circulate, to those who
sign, an information dossier
on the subject.
Helen told a small plan-
ning group of leading IC stu-
dents that although backed
by Oxfam, students could
choose the agency they pre-
ferred (e.g. Christian Aid,
War on Want, etc.) and the
scheme and country to whom
they wished to give. After
the meeting, several Banker's
Orders were signed.
Wearing the prettiest of
mini-dresses and a red PVC
mac, Helen promised to re-
turn today and will also speak
at a meeting tomorrow (Tues-
day) in the Union Top Refec
at 1 p.m.
Now turn to the back page
for an exclusive FELIX
interview with Helen Lewis-
Jones.
Blow to Participation Hopes
In a midsummer letter to
new Union President Corbyn,
Lord Penney, the Rector of
the College, informed the
Union that it could have 3
observers on the Governing
Body, but said little else to
encourage hope of full Union
representation on important
College bodies at an early
date. In particular, the ob-
servers on the Governing
Body will be subject to strict
conditions and the Board of
Studies has completely re-
jected proposals for regular
Union observers at its meet-
ings. Corbyn is known to re-
gard the letter as most dis-
appointing.
The infamous JURGO (the
joint committee of the Union
and Governors) is to be re-
shaped so it may better ful-
fil its liaison function. The
membership will consist of 10
mandated student representa-
tives, 3 Governors, the Rec-
tor, Pro-Rector, Deans of the
Constituent Colleges, Secre-
tary, 4 elected non-profes-
sorial staff, and one Warden.
The new JURGO meets on
17th November.
ICU Council will be al-
lowed its three observers on
the Governing Body for an
experimental period of 2
years, provided the meetings
are treated as confidential.
However, it is unlikely the
Union will agree to the Rec-
tor's suggestion that the ob-
servers must not be mandat-
able, or that they should be
excluded from meetings dis-
cussing staff appointments,
selection of courses, or deter-
mination of academic stand-
ards. First Union reactions
are that these are areas of
vital interest to students, and
that the threatened exclusions
make a mockery of the kind
of real participation the
Union is seeking.
The Governors have delay-
ed a decision on the Union
request for observers on the
Finance and Executive Com-
mittee of the BoG, regarded
as one of the major centres
of power, until Lord Sher-
field, their chairman, returns
from hospital.
However, the major blow
to student hopes comes in the
decision of the Board of Stu-
dies not to invite students ob-
servers except on specific
occasions. This is almost
certain to prove unsatisfac-
tory to the Union as the
major anxiety of those advo-
cating participation was to
broaden courses, reform
methods of assessment, and
generally to discuss impor-
tant academic matters.
The subject matter of the
Rector's letter is certain to
be raised at the first IC Coun-
cil meeting, and probably at
the first Union Meeting.
Engagement
Threatened
The long and protracted
negotiations which could
bring the Architectural Asso-
ciation into IC as the fourth
constituent college, have been
moving comparatively swiftly
during the vacation.
Since the allocation of the
site in Jay Mews, near the
RCA, for the use of the A A
by the University Grants
Committee (acting as the
"marriage-broker") the A A
has been trying to find half a
million pounds to finance the
move from its present cramp-
ed site. During the vacation
the UGC offered to match the
A A pound for pound in their
fund-raising now that the A A
have collected over £180,000.
However, the A A is showing
considerable reluctance to
join on IC's terms, and at
present IC's Secretary Micky
Davies and Rector Lord
Penney do not seem keen to
compromise.
Contacts between A A and
IC students have brought
sympathy for the A A point
of view. At present the Asso-
ciation is highly independent
—it is led by meetings of the
school community, consisting
of lecturers, students, and all
types of staff. There are no
written exams, most work is
project work, and there are
no permanent academic staff,
and only the principal stays
for more than 2 years. The
present lecturers are archi-
tects from businesses who
come in and out, thus pre-
venting ideas from fossilising,
[f the A A joins IC all this will,
according to our Rector, have
to go. The school will be
governed by our BoG, their
staff will have to include at
least 10 permanent members,
recognised as teachers by the
University of London, and
the inflexible course unit and
exam systems will be impos-
ed. Above all it is difficult to
see how the real sense of the
academic community, both in
terms of study and control,
could be preserved.
Lord Penney is reported to
have told A A Principal John
Lloyd in public that the Uni-
versity was responsible for
the strict terms of the mer-
ger. The UGC's offer of
money is, in fact, conditional
upon the merger taking place.
Given all this, the A A stu-
dents say it is not worth-
while joining, in contrast to
the IC students, who would
welcome their creative influ-
ence. However, informed
opinion now suggests that
that Lord Penney and the
Governors will not be too
disappointed if the move
breaks down altogether.
