The Anti - Hero
To students about to
plough into another year's
study of scientific texts and
notes, and to freshers faced
with a ghastly array of text-
books they will be urged to
buy and will never read, it
may seem sheer stupidity to
suggest that there is any
other kind of literature with
which they can pass their lei-
sure time. But unscientific
reading does not automatic-
ally mean uninteresting read-
ing, and some contrast in
what you read is essential if
you are to avoid becoming a
dreaded "damned scientist"
with a mind like an auto-
matic clock. So read on.
The paperback edition of
A Small Town in Germany
has just been printed by Pan
Books at 6/-. The author is
John Le Carre, best known
for "The Spy Who Came In
From The Cold". All of his
five novels contain main
characters whom he tries to
make as unlikeable and de-
testable as possible, the anti-
hero taken to extremes, and
although his books are on
espionage they are as differ-
ent from the conventional
Fleming or Deighton spy-
thriller as Graham Greene is
different from Enid Blyton.
The small town in Ger-
many is Bonn, the western
capital but overshadowed by
the much larger cities of
Hamburg, Frankfurt, Mun-
ich. The anti-hero is a British
civil servant, Turner, sent to
the British Embassy to in-
vestigate the disappearance of
a minor official who took
with him several major files.
Turner seems to hate every-
one; his main qualification
for his job is his ability to
break down the people he
has to interrogate.
At the Bonn Embassy he
meets the father of a girl he
had interrogated at a previ-
ous occasion, and who had
consequently had a nervous
breakdown. He soon makes
himself unpopular with al-
most all the other officials
and staff, except for de Lisle,
a diplomat who can see that
Turner's main war is with
himself. His main aim is to
find out as much as possible
about the character of the
man who disappeared, hoping
he will be able to see where
he would logically hide with
the files, but he finds this sur-
prisingly difficult, the man
seemed to be friends with
no-one, a shadow working in
the embassy for twenty years.
Slowly he develops some
form of affinity with the de-
fector, both men at war with
everyone else and with each
other.
The noticeable thing about
Turner, Leamas and Smiley,
Le Carre's anti-heroes, is that
no matter how contemptible
and unlikeable they are por-
trayed, as you read on you
inevitably start to understand
them and come to sympathise
with their quandary. This is
one of a very few books
which can honestly be des-
cribed as thrillers.
For science-fiction addicts,
Jim Ballard's Disaster Area
has been produced in paper-
back from Panther, 5/-. It
contains nine stories not re-
printed from previous collec-
tions and of a very high stan-
dard. The disaster in the title
sometimes refers to a world-
wide disaster, as in Storm
Bird, Storm Dreamer, where
mutation has caused some
seabirds to grow to gigantic
sizes. At night they come to
haunt the private world of a
man living alone on an aban-
doned jetty. More often, the
disaster is a private disaster,
the disaster of two men de-
prived of sleep and dreams by
a scientific experiment, or the
disaster of a man stranded in
a city which stretches inde-
finitely in all directions. Bal-
lard's characters live in a
dream world constantly turn-
ing to nightmare.
Finally, if all you want is
a fast-moving blood-and-
thunder story, Panther have
also recently published a glut
of Chester Himes novels, all
concerning two negro cops,
Coffin Ed and the Grave Dig-
ger. The setting is Harlem at
night, the plots concern dope
smuggling, gold robbery,
murder and almost any crime
you care to mention. All very
slick and amusing, these are
the kind of books you can
read in an hour or two and
then throw away, or take
back to the second-hand
book shop.
Bookshop expands to College Block
The bookshop has now moved from its cramped quarters
in the Beit quadrangle to new spacious premises between
Chem. Eng. and College Block and with the move has come
a complete change around of the system designed to make
it both more attractive and efficient.
Books are now on display and can be perused before
purchase, the range of books being gradually built up,
particularly in paperbacks and fiction. A changeover to the
continental A4 system of paper sizes is being implemented.
There is a large browsing area where the books are kept,
an exit from which is via a cash desk and a ' quick sales'
counter for ties, pens, etc. The duplicating service, details
of which can be had on request, will be continued and the
shop has a staff of four under Miss Basden, the manageress.
All profits go into the Union, so that it is in the interests
of all students to shop there.
Hours of opening are 9.30 to 5.30 on weekdays in term
time, closed from 11.50 to 12.30 during the first two weeks
of this term but open all day thereafter. During the vac.
the hours will be 9.30 to 2.30. Unfortunately, book tokens
cannot be bought or accepted. It can be reached along the
walkway on the North side of College block from level 2 of
Elec. Eng., Civ. Eng. or Chem. Eng. or up the steps from
the link road behind Chem. Eng. A large illuminated sign
marks it clearly.
