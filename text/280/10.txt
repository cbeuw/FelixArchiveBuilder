ARRANGEMENTS
The F r e s h e r s ' D a y
arrangements made by the
College this year seem to be
designed to make the Fresh-
ers more at ease than in
previous years. Gone are the
mass Freshers' lunches with
hundreds of overwhelmed
first year undergraduates
crammed together to eat in
utter confusion.
This year, after today's
undergraduate Freshman's
Reception in the Royal Geo-
graphical Society Hall, the
freshers will go to their De-
partments for an introduc-
tory talk (11.15 a.m.). After
breaking into groups and
meeting their tutors, they go
off to lunch, no special
arrangements having been
made. In some cases, it is
thought that tutors will take
their groups out to eat some-
where.
The afternoon of Monday
is free, to enable Freshers to
join all the clubs and socie-
ties exhibited in the Union
building on Tuesday, first
year Undergraduates start
the ' Departmental Induc-
tion Procedures', while
second and third year stu-
dents begin normal classes.
Postgraduate Freshmen
are left to hang about the
College until 6.0 p.m. when
there is a reception for them
in the College block ground
floor dining-room.
All students must register
by filling in a Registration
form, and returning it to the
Registry on Level 3 in the
College Block. The three re-
gistration days are Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday of
this week. Where applicable,
Undergraduates may collect
their L.E.A. grant cheques
from the Registry at the
same time.
LODGINGS
SHORTAGE
The number of lodgings
on the list of the U L Lodg-
ings bureau has dropped to
only 10% of that on last
years list. This is largely as
a result of the decision to
tell landladies that only
those who would accept any
student regardless of race
would be listed. According-
ly, the bureau is only help-
ing Freshers.
To ease the situation,
ICU has compiled a list of
addresses which may be of
use, and Mick Braybrook is
working in the Union Office
helping people in difficulties.
Anyone knowing of suitable
addresses is asked to give
them to Mick as soon as
possible. As one Union
official told FELIX: "at
least this shows that students
are prepared to make sacri-
fices in the fight for their
principles ".
The Queen to open College Block
OSCA Appeals
In this age of greater
social awareness, it is be-
coming increasingly obvious
that the student can play a
significant part in the life of
the community in which he
is so often regarded as a
' parasite', or at best a tol-
erated visitor.
The time has come for
the Universities and Col-
leges to give up their roles
as islands, set apart from
their surrounding environ-
ments, from which students
can observe the troubles and
problems of the people all
around them from the safety
of their own private com-
munity. The opportunities
are there for actual first-
hand experience of life and
the problems it brings to
some people.
Throughout the country
students are realising their
great potential in the field
of community service. In
places like Liverpool, Sussex,
Exeter and Hull students are
involved in schemes which
give them enjoyment and
satisfaction, and also greatly
benefit the community of
which they are a part.
Student involvement in
London is very low and
prospective volunteers are
not encouraged by the com-
plex network of voluntary
and statutory organisations
in this field.
London OSCA organisa-
tion for student community
action exists solely for stu-
dents in higher education in
the Greater London area and
is run, by students, as a
clearing house to put you in
touch with the type of job
you would like to do. It has
been found necessary to
employ four former students
to spend the amount of time
that full-time investigation
and evaluation demands.
Imperial College has a soci-
ety for involvement, the
O.S.S., but even so the pos-
sibilities are very varied and
no College Society can hope
to do justice to every aspect
of what is a very wide field.
OSCA is working for YOU,
and is here to be used.
There is a great deal of
scope and many of the op-
portunities would never be
listed in a social services
director. These are practical
jobs that benefit people
directly. Some of your time
at College can be spent in a
way that will benefit the
community and yourself, but
you are never tied to a
scheme; you are free to do
as you like at all times.
If you would like to help,
and that's what it comes
down to when all's said and
done, you can see us at the
Freshers' Reception, or leave
a note addressed to 'OSCA'
at the Union office. If you
want to come and see us
personally, there will always
be someone to welcome you
at:— 28, Woburn Square,
WC1. Tel. 580-0966, or con-
tact the West London field
officer, David Pullen at:—
59, St. Helen's Gardens,
W. 10. Tel. 969-9491.
The mystery guest who
will formally open College
Block on November 27th
will be, it has been revealed,
the Queen. Prince Philip, a
more frequent visitor to IC,
will accompany Her Majes-
ty. The Queen will take tea
in the Students' common
room. The Rector has
vetoed a suggestion from
ICU President Piers Corbyn
that the tea should be open,
and so only a few selected
Union officials will be invi-
ted. The Board of Studies
has agreed to the suspension
of lectures on that day.

grapher captures the imper-
sonal nature of the partly-
opened College Block.

MORALS AND ECONOMICS
In this Felix exclusive, Helen Lewis-Jones of the organisation 3W1 (see front page)
discusses the role of fund raising in relation to the problem of World poverty.
Fund raising improves
the quality of life for thou-
sands of individuals, but it
is now apparent that the
raising of money alone is
not enough. The contribu-
tion that a private individual
or agency can make towards
the Third World can at best
be a drop in the ocean.
So why approach " im-
poverished students", de-
manding part of their paltry
grant? Simply because cer-
tain facts must be faced by
an intelligent section of the
population, and they must
be faced now. In interna-
tional relations the poor
nations are treated as if they
were as economically devel-
oped as the rich; this means
they generally get a raw
deal. International agree-
ments are dominated by the
interests of the "White
5 Year Plan
In response to a request
from the Rector, ICU Coun-
cil has set up a working
party to prepare evidence
for the IC quinquennium re-
port to the UGC. The com-
mittee has met several times
over the vacation and col-
lected evidence from several
Union bodies, e.g. on sports
facilities. A major part of
the report will concern aca-
demic matters, particularly
teaching methods, methods
of assessment, course con-
tent, and, most radically,
how to break down the rigid
department structures by
the proper use of course
units.
Evidence would still be
welcomed from individual
students, and should be in
to the Union Office in the
next week.
Man's Club".
Two arguments can be
used: moral and self-
interest. The moral one is
that out of humanitarian
reasons we could not let half
the world remain under-
developed. The economic
argument is that the rich
countries cannot afford to
ignore half the world in
terms of untapped talent and
resources. The problems of
overpopulation and the gap
between the rich and the
poor are surely going to be
the most serious in the next
few decades. The belief that
underlies 3W1 is that the
discrepancies between the
rich nations and the poor
will be the all-time problem
of the next twenty years.
There is no single panacea.
Every expert will tell you
that these problems must be
solved. The Government
faces them in theory, but is
reticent about practical
action where it seems to
threaten short-term strategic
interests. Governments mask
their inactivity by altruistic
rhetoric: Government aid is
often little more than a poli-
tical chess game.
3W1, based on the Ban-
Penney
Faces ICU
The Rector, Lord Penney,
has acceded to a Union re-
quest to answer criticism of
his policy on discipline pro-
cedures and other issues at
the first Union General
Meeting of the session on
October 9th. Watch out for
posters giving the time and
place.
ker's Order scheme, is essen-
tially in existence to combat
this apathy and resistance by
informing intelligent public
opinion. Every student who
signs a Banker's Order will
be sent a series of dos-
siers which will contain
articles by a variety of ex-
perts concerned with the
problems of the developing
nations. Ideas for future
action will also be suggested.
We can all be armchair
intellectuals. If you sign a
Banker's Order, you will
automatically become a part
of the " Unlimited Com-
pany" of 3W1, which has
the funds, the information
and the organization to
really make an impact in
this country. It is up to you
to contribute not only a
small percentage of your
income to overseas aid but
to give us your ideas. The
policy that 3W1 adopts —
its success or its ignomon-
ious failure — is up to you.
We do not offer badges or
membership cards: we want
your thoughts and your
action. You will be contac-
ted by a member of the
existing 3W1 group at
Imperial — or why not con-
tact them via the Union?
" If it is demonstrated . . .
that it is the popular will to
make a greater effort to
help the Third World, the
knowledge, organization, and
the resources exist to carry
it out."
