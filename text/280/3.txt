What will the future hold for IC ?
New President Piers Corbyn ponders
Piers Corbyn, President. That's something no-one expected until Martin Bland broke the
news to a startled college that he would be proposing Piers at the forthcoming election.
From then it was only a matter of time before he won 40% more votes than Spike Bantin
and was declared President of the Union. Although only in his fifth year at college he is
possibly the best-known person there, if only on account of the colossal amount of dupli-
cated info, sheets he turns out. To explain how he lost his senses and was conned into pro-
posing Piers, we persuaded the aforementioned Martin Bland to write a short profile of
the man himself.
Corbyn — Genius or Madness ?
It has been said that
genius and madness are sep-
arated by a thin line. Piers
Richard Corbyn, or "Crow-
face" to his friends, has one
foot somewhat shakily
planted on each side of it.
He may often be seen strid-
ing from Soutshside to the
Union, or Physics, clutching
great sheafs of paper, which
he tends to leave in trail's
behind him, like fallout from
the information explosion,
and muttering to himself a
strange monosyllable best
rendered in print as "buzzz
buzzz".
This phenomenon has so
amazed the students of I.C.
that When the first ever col-
lege wide election for the
post of president was held
last June, they decided to
give Piers the job.
Who is Piers Corbyn? He
comes from human parents
(though looking at him you
may suspect some traces of
chimpanzee) somewhere in
the region of Newport,
Shropshire, where he is
known to his family as
Richard and to his friends
as "Mad Dick". He first en-
tered these hallowed halls in
1965 as a physics under-
graduate with an insane desire
to work. He soon began to
divert part of his energy to
other aspects of student life,
and threw himself into the
club scene, spending his
third year as president of
Maths, and Phys. soc. He
was associated with various
other club activities and even
displayed his athletic prowess
by croSS-country running,
and it was no doubt then
that he acquired the some-
what extravagant habit of
running to Marble Arch and
back at 2 a.m., to the bewil-
derment of the fuzz and the
horror of passing taxis.
Last year, as a first-year
Physics P.G., Piers really
came into his own as the I.C.
catalyst, except that in his
case he increased the rate
of action rather than re-
action. I had the misfortune
to live on the same landing
as Piers last year and many
was the night I was kept
awake by the clattering of a
typewriter (my typewriter, he
seemed to borrow it perman-
ently!) as the latest bumph
sheet was born. Piers had an
obsession with spreading in-
formation, Which, I suppose,
is highly commendable in a
floor rep., as he was at the
time, but hard on my type-
writer.
From the whirlwind of
Corbyn energy was born the
U.S.K. of Which you will
read much elsewhere, and
the new constitution would
not have come about without
him. Not that he accom-
plished these things alone, of
course. The Corbyn enthu-
siasm is infectious (beware!)
and he is a past master of
conning people into doing
things for him. Even I, I
must admit, was conned into
proposing him for president
and managing his campaign.
He conned the Union Top
Brass into giving him a
Union General Award, the
highest honour the Union
can give one of its members,
etc., etc., in recognition of
his efforts. He even conned
the Union members into
voting for him. So there he
is, President, and I am back
where I began.
So I hope you're happy
with your President. Next
time you see him in the bar,
try and get him to buy you
a drink (something I always
find very difficult) and tell
him what you think of him,
the Union, I.C. in general
and anything elese you think
is worth the effort. He's your
president, make sure he
knows how you want your
Union run and make sure he
runs it that way. I'm off to
I.C.I, so you'll have to see
that he behaves yourselves.
Have a good year!
MARTIN BLAND
Earl Arrives
Presenting Mr. Pete Earl,
about whom little was known
until the middle of last term.
Then posters began to appear
in the departmental buildings
and halls of residence, bear-
ing a line sketch and the
legend "Pete Earl, Vice-
President". This duly came
true at the very end of last
year.
In an election poll of over
a thousand votes, Pete Earl
defeated George Assimakis
by only 30 vote's, no mean
feat considering how well-
know his opponent is.
In contrast to George, he
produced very little electoral
propaganda and information,
his campaign rested solely on
his hustings speech, although
he did have the considerable
backing of the R.S.M. and
the Rugby Club.
He is a Minesman, a mem-
ber of the Anglican Chap-
laincy, and, by common con-
sent and opinion, a nice guy,
which is a useful qualifica-
tion for one of the most
thankless jobs in the Union,
the Deputy Presidency. He
has been defeated in a bid to
become a Floor Rep., and
was the assistant secretary of
the Athletics Club Commit-
tee, organising coach trans-
port for teams and other
such business. He helped to
organise the Rugby Club
during his time with A.C.C.;
this year he will be vice-
chairman of the Chaps club,
the Mines' drinking club,
and as such he will be in
charge of discipline.
In the academic year 67-
68 his was the task of orga-
nising the Carnival Fete. It
rained on the day and a loss
was made, but it was said at
the time that Pete was rela-
tively inexperienced and re-
ceived little or no help from
the Carnival Committee.
Since then he has had time
to gain experience in orga-
Pete Earl
nising committee affairs, and
is now about to embark on a
year of helping to organise
the Union's affairs, on which,
we hope, he will spend
slightly more time than he
does with the Mines drinkers.
Not having any propaganda
to keep to, he has a free
hand in his policies; whether
these prove right or not we
will not know until the end
of the year.
Guy — At Last
Keith Guy was voted Sec-
retary of the Union by a sub-
stantial majority over S.
Sivasegarem, although one
tenth of the poll abstained.
Ironically, last year he was
an opponent of some of the
constitutional r e f o r m s,
mainly on the grounds that
the proposed council would
be far too unwieldy to be
effective, since its size would
be swollen with several de-
partmental reps. This was an
objection held by many, and
was the greatest stumbling
block in having the reforms
passed, as they finally were,
but the reforms did mean
that Keith was elected by all
the members Of the Union.
He is in a unique position
to express his views on Coun-
cil, for this will be his fifth
year as a member, having
held several different post of
responsibility since the be-
ginning of his third year.
He's been at I.C. for seven
years, and has a Masters de-
gree in Chemical Physics.
Having blown himself up
during his studies for
a Ph.D., he started again
after two year and is at pre-
sent studying in Chemical
Engineering.
To go briefly through his
career, he claims to have
done nothing in his first year,
then became secretary of
ConSoc. (Conser v a t i v e
Society) in bis second. He
took over as chairman of
ConSoc. in his third year
here, and then chairman of
the Social Clubs Committee
When he Started his first year
as a P.G. He became, in
quick succession, a floor rep.
on council, secretary of the
Entertainments Committee,
and then Chairman of the
Ents. Committee.
Appropriately, he des-
cribes the Union as his main
hobby, and enjbys watching
the same people squabbling
over the Council Table every
year. He is married to a
schoolteacher, has no chil-
dren yet. Politically, he says
he is a "left-wing conserva-
tive, if anything", but plenty
of people could be found to
disagree with the "'left-wing"
part! Nevertheless, he claims
there are as many hard-line
right wingers he disagrees
With as there are on the ex-
treme left, and the only
people he is intolerant of are
those Who will not tolerate
others.
So that is Keith Guy, one
of the most experienced
people in the Union, and
holding a job which means a
great deal of hard work.
Good luck to him!
