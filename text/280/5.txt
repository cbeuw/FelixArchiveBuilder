. . . and so to you
When all the material for
one page has been gathered
together, the page is set up in
a frame and clamped in ready
for proofing which is done on
a proofing press. It is then
sent back for checking by our
industrious staff.
Once the FELIX staff have
decided to rewrite their
articles and completely re-
hash the pages during proof
reading, the pages are ready
for printing.
After all the pages are
printed on the presses shown
below, they are collected to-
gether, folded and sent down
to Imperial College. During
the Wednesday evening, the
illustrious and dashing Feli-
city Editor has written Feli-
city and duplicated it with
the help of any friends he has
managed to co-opt. Then
Felicity and any insert ad-
vertisements are put inside
the copies of FELIX and
placed in piles ready for de-

livery to halls and news-
stands in the early hours of
Thursday morning.
FELIX therefore reaches
you perhaps from the hands
of one of I.C's. fairer sex who
are co-opted as salesgirls.
You probably then glance
through it and possibly even
read a few articles (after all,
you're reading this one) and
think, "That is the end of
FELIX".
Well, that's where FELIX
should start, with you, your
ideas, your abilities or just
your willingness to work.
If you feel you have been
graced with writing ability,
you own a camera, have a
flair for collecting advertisers,
can brew tea or collect beer
from the bar, can sweep the
floor or help to sell FELIX,
why not come along to a
press meeting and help pro-
duce your paper? Press meet-
ing happen on Tuesdays and
Thursdays at dinner time,
about 12.45 p.m., so if you
are interested, come along.
There's always plenty to do!

Behind the protective grill the pages of
type reciprocate under the printing cylin-
der. The printing cylinder complete with
sheet of paper is in the centre of the picture.
Above this is a sheet of paper " queuing-
up " to be printed.
Here at the backend of the machine, the
board at top holds the unprinted sheets.
At the bottom is the pile of printed sheets.
Above the pile, the last sheet printed is
about to descend.

"The trouble with Lloyds is that there's nothing to protest about."
Lloyds B a n k say*yes?

Because Lloyds Bank don't
make charges to students. Our ser-
vices are absolutely free—as long as
your account is kept in credit.
Maybe you don't consider it
worth opening a bank account while
you're on a student grant. It is worth
it. A bank account is by far the best
way of planning, controlling and
keeping track of your spending how-
ever limited your means.
The key is your Lloyds Bank
manager. Financial disasters are far
more easily avoided with a bank
account—plus someone to help you
if you do get into trouble. A Lloyds
Bank manager tends to be under-
standing about the very occasional
and unavoidable overdraft. And if
you're hopeless at managing^
your money anyway, just
ask him — that's his job!
