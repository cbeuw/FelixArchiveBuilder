Lord Penney, Rector of
I.C. since 1967, has been
awarded the Order of Merit,
one of the highest honours
awarded by the Queen. As
Sir William Penney, he was
chairman of the UKAEA
during the development of
the technically successful, but
commercially disappointing,
advanced gas-cooled reactor.
Previously, he had been head
of the AWRE, Aldermaston,
having been associated with
atomic weapons since the
days of Los Alamos. He
watched from the air the ex-
plosion of the second atomic
bomb dropped on the Japan-
ese, at Nagasaki.
Lord Penney's appointment
as Rector was not without
controversy. Some students
felt that his involvement with
the development of the first
atom-bomb made him an
unsuitable choice, and there
were rumours that the staff
would have preferred a senior
member of staff to a man
whose connection with I.C.
was as a student and staff
member over two decades
ago. However, staff-student
relations have improved un-
der his auspices and he has
earnt the affectionate title of
'Undle Bill'. Lord Penney,
who writes occasional letters
to FELIX, is one of only
100 holders of the O.M.
Mooney
Moans
As old lags Will now have
realised, the price of Mooney
food has increased yet again
(3d. for main course, 2d. for
sweets). This time most of
the increase is because more
staff are needed for the new
college block refectories.
The final increases were
sanctioned after the end of
last term when no members
of the catering sub-commit-
tee were available. Keith
Guy, the only student to at-
tend the meeting, Said the
price increases were inevit-
able under the direumstances.
However, many complaints
are being made. In particular
the standard of food in the
South-side lower refectory
has deteriorated tremendous-
ly in the last year and is now
' almost inedible'.
There is faint glimmer of
hope for the future. At the
last Union Council meeting
it Was suggested that the
operational research unit at
IC be asked to make an effi-
ciency study of IC's refector-
ies. Prof. Eilon, head of the
Management Engineering sec-
tion of Mech. Eng., in a
letter to Pete Earl, Deputy
President, suggested that an
M.Sc. project was possible
next year.
Caine
Out
Sir Sydney Caine, Direc-
tor of LSE at the time of
the AdelStein-Bloom suspen-
sions, and controversial
author of a book attacking
students Unions, has been re-
placed on the Board of Gov-
ernors. Sir Robin Darwin,
Rector of the Royal College
Of Art, who replaces him,
recently attacked the UGC
and IC for the way in which
the site for the A A was ob-
tained. A former IC Presi-
dent, Dr. A. Kitchener, has
also been appointed to the
B.o.G.; FELIX files show
him to be a bald but effi-
cient President although a
rather better cricketer. N . C.
MaCdiarmid, right-wing Presi-
dent of the Iron and Steel
Institute, has also joined the
B.o.G.
General Studies
This year's G.S. programme

'High Sea' in Action
" Whale off the port bow,
Sir"; without doubt this
statement sums up the gen-
eral atmosphere on the latest
cruise on the College's new
yacht, High Sea.
The two week happening
got off to a damp start when
one of the more senior mem-
bers of the crew walked
straight out of the yacht club
bar onto the boat, tripped
on a sheet and came up gurg-
ling something about one can
only judge boats and women
by What's underneath. De-
spite his invitations to join
him, tempered with childish
comments such as " It's quite
warm for the time of year'
(the Sinister black pipe mark-
ed ' Sewers' was pointed out
to him at a later date) were
ignored in favour of listen-
ing to predictions from the
Bracknell Oracle. Within the
hour High Sea creamed out
of Ramsgate harbour under
full sail, the scene was set for
some perfect sailing. This
blissful existence was rudely
interrupted when we came
out of the lee of the Kent
Cliffs. The sudden presence
of a swell produced a similar
effect to a 17 in. armour
piercing shell hitting a green-
house. We now paid the price
for a hurried departure; the
first knell of the calamity was
the Still half full bottle of
duty free whisky performing
a death defying leap into the
bilges. The skipper Who had
been transferred directly
from the arms of Bacchus to
those of Orpheus reacted like
a true salt. As the first mole-
cule reached his nostrils his
starboard weather eye scan-
ned the saloon (aply named)
and on seeing the magic
liquor mixing with the not
so matured bilge water a
quaking cry of ' all hands'
rocked the boat.
Souped
In order to make the bi-
centenary celebrations of Che
Chichester yacht club, it was
necessary to sail all of that
night. The traditional event
to make ' every night at
sea different' occurred soon
after the moon had set, one
of the girls had just made
soup for the new-watch and
was about to hand a cup to
myself, when the boat lurch-
ed before a rather large sea,
in trying to steady herself a
hand complete with cup of
soup went out towards an
imaginary support but char-
Follow-up Alcohol Survey
Students Who are entering
their third year now Will
surely remember that the Al-
cohol Impact Project, which
is part of London University,
sent a questionnaire to all
students who were then in
their first year two years ago.
The Alcohol Impact Pro-
ject team, who are still very
much in business, and who
are as interested in under-
standing variations in normal
drinking habits and attitudes
as they are in the serious
community health problem of
alcoholism, are conducting a
number of studies of young
people and their drinking of
Which their investigation of
students at this college is
one.
The research workers say
that this is an area in which
everyone holds opinions but
in which there is surprisingly
little hard information of the
sort that can be provided by
such a survey. Apparently
the response rate from this
college was so good two years
ago and the information ob-
tained so complete that it has
been thought worthwhile to
enlarge the scope of the study
to find out What has happen-
ed to the drinking habits and
attitudes of this group of
students over a two year
period. This will add enor-
mously to the value of the
study.
So all third year students
should look out for another
questionnaire which will ap-
pear shortly in their depart-
ments. Once again the organ-
isers of this survey wish to
stress that the information
given is to be treated with
the strictest confidentiality.
No names appear on the
questionnaires, only a code
number which allows the re-
searchers to keep a track
of returned questionnaires.
"Support" for Americans
A group of six Americans
met by chance about 18
months ago and from a com-
mon sympathy decided to
form a group called "SUP-
PORT". The purpose of
"SUPPORT" is to learn as
much as possible about the
U.S. Draft Laws and to make
this information available to
the individual American Who
finds himself in conflict with
the U.S. Vietnam policy.
They meet once a week at
their offices, 5 Caledonian
Road, and give an excellent
counselling service. " SUP-
PORT " welcomes your assis-
tance, even if it is just offer-
ing crash-pads for desperate
Americans.

acteristically found the inside
of a freshly occupied sleeping
bag. The resulting language
from the occupant can be
heard in part at A l l Saints
Ohuroh, Fuflham, this Sunday.
Despite twice sailing past
the narrow, cunningly con-
cealed entrance we did make
Chichester, but exhaustion
overcame us and we retired
to bed. After causing the
locals considerable fright, we
left ItChenor in the late after-
noon, a light breeze pushing
us gently towards the Chan-
nel Isles, so gentle in fact
that we set about preparing
a hot meal, leaving one man
on deck to tend the helm.
Without any warning, the
boat lurched to an untimely
halt—aground, marked on
the charts as the Winner
Sand's, dry at low tide. The
tide went out and came in,
during which time we had
the most substantial meal of
the trip, despite the difficul-
ties of cooking at 45 degrees.
Stranded
The passage across the
Channel was a rough one,
most of the way we were
beating into the teeth of a
gale and being tossed about
by breaking seas. After a
three day stay in St. Peter
Port we were almost laughed
out of the island when, after
returning with some provi-
sions, the dinghy was found
suspended from the harbour
wall on 8 ft. of warp some
20 ft. clear of the water—
amazing things these tides.
The rest of the trip was
equally eventful but space
and ethics prevent it being
printed here. The College
yacht was, believe it or not,
returned and can be inspected
on application to the Under-
water club. I would also
like to mention the week-end
cruises we will be running
for the first month of term.
