Everyman's Guide to College Block
In this FELIX exclusive Domestic Bursar Carl Seaford, also popular warden of Selkirk Hall, describes exactly what is where in the giant new College Block the Queen
will formally open next month.
The building of College
Block succeeded in bringing
to fruition a three-fold pur-
pose of the College. The first
was to concentrate all Ad-
ministration in one building;
the second was to supply
from the areas vacated by the
various sections of adminis-
tration new sites, rooms and
general accommodation for
the increasing needs of the
academic side of the college;
thirdly because of increased
numbers the College felt the
need to provide more social
accommodation and, with
this in mind, new refectories,
common rooms, a large hall
for 800 people and two sem-
inar areas (each taking 120),
were included in the build-
ing.
In a separate part of the
building at the western end
are also located not only the
National Science Library but
the Lyon Playfair, which is
for scientific matter, and the
Haldane Library which is for
books of general reading and
also includes a record library
of high repute. The academic
portion of the building is
housed on the upper floors at
the eastern end. On the top
floor are the offices of the
Rector, and Secretary, as well
as the Maintenance and De-
velopment offices. On Level 4
is found the Finance and Sup-
plies section of administration
and on Level 3 is the Reg-
istry. These sections may be
reached by staircases located
in the main hall in the mid-
dle of the building and also
by staircases at the eastern
end. There will also be a lift
at the eastern end as well as
two lifts in the main Hall.
On Level 2 at the eastern
end is a cloakroom for the
main Student Common Room
area, which is approximately
9,000 square feet, off which
is a Conference Room which
will be used by the Union.
This large Student Common
Room can be used for many
purposes. It is completely
newly furnished by the Col-
lege for the benefit of stud-
ents, the carpets are plugged
and can be removed if the
room is used for dancing or
other activities where a car-
pet is not required. There will
also be a Bar at the end of
the Room and students can
go from the Common Room
into the Student Buttery,
where it is hoped to be able
to serve this type of meal,
plus teas and coffees, for most
of the day. The exact times
will be notified to students.
Beyond this and further west
is the Senior Common Room,
the Staff Dining Room and
Buttery, which are only open
to members of staff.
Coming down to Level 1,
or Ground Floor Level, will
be found the main College
Refectory, which will serve
both cafeteria and waitress
served meals at lunchtime
and will cater for large din-
ners in the evening. This Re-
fectory has an ante-room,
which is next door to the
main lift hall, and both this
ante-room and the refectory
will be open to all members
of the College at lunchtime.
Below the ante-room on
Level 0 is a Quiet Room,
which will hold about 130
people, and will be used for
Church Services of any reli-
gion and other similar pur-
poses.
All that has been said so
far deals with College Block
to the west of the main lift
hall and main entrance. To
the east of this Hall there
are, on Level 5, various
offices, the two seminar
rooms mentioned previously
(one of which will be used for
concerts) and below these on
Level 4 will be various other
offices and the lower en-
trances to the seminar rooms.
On Level 3 and 2 is located
the Great Hall, bookings for
this and the seminar rooms
and the Quiet Room, will be
the duty of the Domestic
Bursar's Office. The Great
Hall is composed of a mov-
ing stage so that the number
of people accommodated will
be dependent on the position
of the stage. The numbers
accommodated in the flat
area of the Hall will be be-
tween 500 and 200. There is
to the rear of this a bank of
thick seats (holding about
300) and there are, of course,
press rooms, a projection
room and general operation
rooms.
From Level 2 entrance can
be gained to the two libraries
which are located on the
northern side of the main
part of the building which
leads to what used to be
called Imperial Institute
Road. The only part of this
Institute which now remains
is the Queen's Tower, which
is surrounded by a lawn.
On the Ground Floor,
under the Great Hall and to
the west of the main entrance,
are located the various sec-
tions of the Domestic Bur-
sar's staff, including the Sec-
urity Office, Student Houses
and Halls of Residence Office
(these latter two will move in
October), the Books Office
and Enquiry Desk for Book-
ings, and the General Mes-
sengers' Office.
Also on this level is the
First Aid Room, where
people may go to rest if they
do not feel well. (They
should, however, inform the
Health Centre so that a
nurse can come over if
necessary).
On the level below will be
the Telephone exchange
(which will also be moving
into College Block later)
and the Post Room.
At the present moment
there is a temporary office for
the National Westminster
Bank on Level 4 in the Main
Lift Hall, but this will be
moving as soon as possible
to the most western end of
the building on Ground Floor
Level, and the Bank will have
a separate entrance on to the
roadway which circles Col-
lege Block.
Mention has not been
made of the fact that on
Ground Floor Level or Level
1, the kitchens which will
provide the meals are located.
Connected to these will be
the Office of the Refectory
Manager, Mr. Mooney, and
his various offices.
Not in the building, but
built in conjunction with it is
the College Bookshop. This is
located on the walkway
which runs the whole length
of College Block, on the
south side, at Level 2, and is
connected with the Walkway
which goes past Elec. Eng.,
R.S.M., and Mech. Eng. Stu-
dents should note on this
Walkway the various notice
boards which are located
there, immediately outside
the large Common Room.
They should have no diffi-
culty in finding the various
areas in this new building as
these are clearly marked by
signs and notices if they ap-
proach the building through
the main entrance or by the
Walkway on Level 2.
