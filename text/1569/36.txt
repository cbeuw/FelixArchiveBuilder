This week the Felix editor asks
you to write the horoscopes.
You realise that you are not
amusing enough to actually
do it properly, and hope that
no-one notices the decline in
quality as you run out of ideas.
This week you realise that
horoscopes might be true
when you are gored by a
bull. You spend the week in
hospital cursing your parents
for not having more sex in
June so it could have at least
been a fish attacking you in-
stead.
This week you spend your
entire time watching Twitch
Plays Pokémon. As you try
to explain the Helix Fossil
to the hot girl at the bar you
realise that you might need
to rethink your priorities. Oh
well, at least a pint is in easy
reach.
This week you drunkenly run for
every position in the Big Elec-
tions. You’ll probably fail your
exams as you spend the entire
revision period campaigning,
but that doesn’t matter if you’re
a Sabb, right?
This week you have your re-
curring dream of a wardrobe
with the key in falling on you
again. When you wake up it
turns out you just fell asleep
during sex and your boyfriend
has just put a bit of weight on.
This week your friend sets you
up on a blind date. It turns
out that she has green, scaly
skin, breathes fire and doesn’t
drink. But at least she’s not a
Geologist, right?
This week the latest job you
applied for gets back to you.
It isn’t good. The idea of doing
a Masters at Imperial is much
too soul depressing. Going to
UCL isn’t too much of a be-
trayal, right?
This week you decide to order
food at 0300 from your room in
Beit. The delivery driver arrives at
0400 but can’t find Beit, Imperial,
Exhibition Road or Hyde Park. You
resign yourself to walking down to
the station to collect your cold Ke-
bab, glaring at the solitary motor-
ists driving by.
This is depressing enough, so you
win the lottery. One can dream.
This week you realise that you
have so little chance of get-
ting laid that you decided to
post a lonely hearts in Catnip.
Unfortunately everyone thinks
that they are all made up and
you get no response. You re-
alise that there is no way you
can go on, and so drown your
sorrows in Metric instead.
This week after having filled in
the Sex Survey you are inspired
to have sex on Queen’s Lawn.
Unfortunately a security guard
catches you mid act and you
have to run to Gloucester Road
with your pants clutched to
your crotch. At least the people
on the tube still avoid your eye.
This week you are hungry
enough to order cheesy fries in
568. When the cold congealed
mess arrives you swear off
union food for good. Or at least
until this time next week.
This week you procrastinate
doing your lab report by switch-
ing on the Sochi Olympics. Six
hours of curling later, you’ve lost
your voice from shouting your
expert advice at the screen but
are no closer to finishing the
work.

Tony Blair Actually
Really Nice Guy
T
he appointment this
week for Fulhma FCs 3rd
manager of the season, Felix
Magath, has resulted in
rumours confirmed by our
sources that you may well be in line
for the manger job before the end of
the season.
Whilst Magath is expected to be
in charge until the end of the season,
Hangman’s contacts within the club
have confirmed that the German is
likely to be out of the door by the end
of the season at which point you will
be approached for the job of guiding
the side out of the Championship. You
will, however, be forced to take Joe
Kinnear as your assistant.
Loves To Give Friends Caring
Advice
F
ollowing the news this
week that Tony Blair sent
a kind email of advice to
Rebekah Brooks mere
six days before she was
arrested, this paper must conclude
that he’s just a really nice guy.
Telling his friend that “it will
pass” and to “tough up” the former
Prime Minister took time in his busy
schedule back in 2011 to dispense
some helpful and caring advice.
“Definitely sleeping pills” the kindly
former leader of the country added
as advice to his both his long-term
friends before their subsequent - and
ongoing - stressful ordeals.
Whilst many mistrusted and did not
believe the ex-Prime Minister to be a
nice guy by the time he left office in
2007, the stunning revelations this
week have softened many people’s
objections to the man who took us
into Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in
2003.
“I mean this just goes to show that,
at heart, he’s just a really nice, God-
fearing man” said one passer-by.
The current Prime Minister, David
Cameron added “I used to think he
was a bit of a dick, but I know I think
he’s just a nice guy trying to make his
way in the world”
