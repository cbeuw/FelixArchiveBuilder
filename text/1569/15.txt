FRIDAY 21 FEB
ARTS
The Blind Astronomer
Is science emotional? Clara Clark Nevola interviews theatre maker
Tom Espiner about the play Going Dark to find out
D
oes the life of a man relate
to that of a star? Going
Dark tells the history of
the universe as the story
of how we perceive it,
creating a deeply human, emotional
and immersive piece of theatre.
The play is centred round the life
of Max, a planetarium astronomer,
who gradually loses his sight due
to Retinitis Pigmentosa. His ability
to work decreases, his relationship
with his young son changes, and his
identity as an individual is altered
and questioned. Sound&Fury, a
collaborative theatre company, have
created with Going Dark a startlingly
immersive experience, allowing the
audience to enter the heart of the
developing Solar System, the mind
of a blind man and the emotions of
a child.
After its first UK tour last year,
Going Dark is returning to London
with a run at the Science Museum.
I interviewed the co-founder of
Sound&Fury, Tom Espiner, to find
out how Going Dark came to life and
what the link between art and science
is, and might become.
How did the idea for the play come
about? How did the link between
going blind and space discovery
emerge?
It’s an idea which had been on our
minds for a long time. There were
several impulses but one of the first
ones was a real attraction for the
building of a planetarium: it’s a tool
for education and helps our scientific
understanding of the universe, but
it’s also a sort of secular temple, an
intimate environment in which a lot
of self-reflection happens. You’re
confronted with the infinite, the very
large, the wonderful.
We were also really interested in the
idea of bringing together light, sound
and darkness, all key elements of a
planetarium and of our own work.
Because of our previous interest in
darkness we wanted to create a play
about the senses and our perceptions,
particularly the hindering of visual
perception.
We also started to find that there
were some interesting parallels
between the way in which we, as a
human race over millennia, have seen
and understood celestial objects,
the scale of the universe, and the
dynamics of light, with how we
relate to what we see in the world
around us: a correlation between
cosmological understanding and our
own understanding of our daily lives
as we interact with the world. So: life
through the eye and universe through
the telescope.
How much of your play is based on
scientific research?
It started with late Prof Richard
Gregory of the University of Bristol,
a neuropsychologist who spent his
whole life studying the relationship
between the brain and the eye, and
optical illusions. He’d come to see
one of our previous plays and was
really interested in how in the dark we
could create images and sensations in
our mind’s eye.
I also did a residency with
Birmingham Physics and Astronomy
department for nine months,
speaking to various astronomers
and physicists. As I was exploring
what they were doing there I became
naturally interested in how vision
works, and how so much of the
universe that we now understand and
study does not rely on sight alone,
using instrumentation that sees
wavelengths that we don’t. I guess
for anyone who does science that’s
just par for the course, but it’s still a
very wonderful thing to explore and
present to an audience.
We were funded by the Wellcome
Foundation to work with experts in
their field: we approached Dr Fitch,
a psychiatrist specialising in visual
consciousness and the hallucinations
often brought on by loss of sight
(Charles Bonnet syndrome), elements
which were incorporated in our
play. We also spoke to RP Fighting
Blindness, who gave us insights into
the details of going blind. Research is,
and always has been, a major part of
our work.
To what extent to you think that
the increasing public availability
to scientific knowledge is making
people blind to its wonders?
We have a plethora of science
communicators nowadays: I grew up
with Carl Sagan, who for me was one
of the best science communicators
ever, and of course Brian Cox is all
over the place – instilling wonder for
anyone who wants to see him on TV.
Initially we thought we could get
an astronomer to give a talk at the
Young Vic: the scientist as showman
is a well-established model and it’s
great to see that, from Humphrey
Davy on, that tradition is alive and
well. But we wanted to take a step
in a different direction: we wanted a
human element. Theatre is, as well as
a place to educate, a place of stories
and a place of emotions, and we
wanted to meet that challenge.
It’s very difficult to achieve this, but
we wanted to intertwine a compelling
story with some good hard core
science facts, and finding a way in
which they could relate to each other.
And when you do that, you draw
together audiences which wouldn’t
usually be together, all in the same
room, sharing a story and getting
different things out of it.
There’s almost a tendency for
scientists to become part of a sort
of exclusive priesthood: they’re in a
group of people who, thanks to years
of study, can understand things in
great detail, and come to see great
beauty which often can’t be explained
to others, as a lot of mathematical
knowledge is needed to appreciate it.
So it’s really important that people try
to communicate that by finding the
right type of metaphor or language to
enlighten us.
Dr Francisco Diego, vice president
of the UK Association for Astronomy
Education gave one of the post-
show talks and said that in our
character we had created someone
who instilled wonder like the old-
school communicators did – a style
of science communication which
just isn’t around as much anymore.
Which is a shame: evoking wonder
and excitement about science is a
powerful tool.
Could Going Dark be a good model
for Science Communication in
the future? Or was this a one off
instance of science reflecting the
human story you wanted to convey?
I believe that the story comes first
and foremost, and there must be
plausibility in the emotional story. I
think it’s a very good way of bringing
science understanding into the public
domain, but it’s hard to achieve – a
balancing act. Audiences are smart
and they will pick up on something
being didactically rammed down
their throat. I do think one should
strive to bring art and theatre
together with science.
Going Dark has been described
as “an Imax without the pictures”
,
as it is an incredibly immersive
experience thanks to the sounds
and minimal lighting you use.
How much does your work rely on
advances in technology?
Ever since we started we’ve wanted
to push the boundaries of the
technological elements of theatre
– partly because technology is
getting better all the time. It has
to be used with caution as you can
easily overdose; once again, the core
elements of a good story are essential.
The more refined and delicate you
can be with sound and light, the more
detail you can bring out.
Some people have described our
work as immersive theatre: the
sound is spatialised and massive so
that the audience is actually plunged
sonically into the scene, and we
conjure up a sense of place, shared
by audience and actors at the same
time. Our sound designer, Dan Jones,
has really studied how to achieve
exactly the right reverb, harnessing
the audience’s imagination and
transporting them to the scenes; all
the technology we use is there to
serve the story. We would like our
audience to think “I was really there”,
not to think “that sound technology
was excellent!”
Going Dark will be performed at
the performance space of the Science
Museum from 5th-9th March 2013.
Tickets are £20 for adults, £8 for
students, and are available from the
Science Museum website.
