Errata
Last week we printed the wrong version of
the left music page. We apologise for the
error to both our readers and the author,
Stuart Masson.
We also put a puzzling date on the puzzles
page :)
Hey, you! Just because
we’re in February, it
doesn’t mean you can’t
get involved in Felix!
There’s still plenty of
time, so pick up a finger
and send us an email. If
you had come this
week, you
would have
received an
apple pie.
What’s On?
Friday 21st:
Live Indie Bands (AYB and Crystal X) in
Metric, also available on icradio.com
OR
Vocal Evening with MT Soc and A Capella
societies from 7PM (part of ArtsFest).
