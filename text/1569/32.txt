After having met that strange man
I decided to stay low for next few
hours. However before I could even
say “stay low” I heard yet another
voice shouting something.
“Hey man, I’m heading over to
cherno. I don’t have any food or
anything can you help me out?” a
very Scottish accent said.
From my obviously useless cover I
eyed this guy up. He sounded sane
enough, and didn’t look that crazy
either. Maybe my I had finally found
a friend! Wearily I stepped out.
“Sure I have some food, what do you
have to offer me for it?”
“Well, I can always offer you your
life.”
He said it so incredibly calmly and
eerily that it sent chills down my
spine. Before he could react, I ran
at him and hit him in the head with
my axe. He immediately dropped.
I whacked him in the head again,
just to make sure he was really
dead. I had now killed someone. I
turned and left, not even looting the
mangled corpse that lay bleeding
behind me. However on second
I decided I would hide and see if
anything interesting happened. I
found myself a better bush than
last time, and waited it out. Twenty
minutes later, another man ran
towards the body. He looked at the
corpse, then turned to the sky.
“I will find you, you bitch!!!”
, he
screamed.
Very worried he had seen me I
crouched down low. Soon however
it became apparent that he had
just vented his anger. As I saw him
looking for me from my hiding spot,
I smiled and thought: Can’t wait till
you do.
DayZ Stories
The DayZ standalone has been
released, and given the amazing
stories that occur in that game, I
decided to make a kind of series
out it! So here it goes:

Virtual Reality
In-game purchases
Mobiles
DLC

Gaming is something I hold very
dearly. I will defend my love with
tooth and nail. Furthermore I like the
status quo. I like the way I buy, play
and interact with games, and in fact
I could say that I am actually missing
the past a bit. However I can see
that gaming is changing, and maybe
not always for the best. So here I list
the 4 main things that will influence
gaming in the foreseeable future:
There are the good type of DLCs and
the bad type of DLCs. I shall focus on
the bad type: the one that forces you
to pay if you want to have a complete
game. The picture below says it
all. Back in the day, when I bought
my first Rome total war (yes again
with that game), I remember that
the expansion packs actually added
entirely new content. No with the
second Rome, the DLC just unlock
factions that are already available
in the game. This trend of needing
to monetize a game by forcing users
to pay at several different instances,
just to extend the lifetime of a game,
is infuriating. I mean, I am not going
to buy a car and then need to pay
an extra £100 to be able to use the
radio. This type of business model is
found nowhere else in the world, and
justifiably so. However with the profit
margins of Game makers shrinking
and shrinking, they will persist with
this model. So expect more and more
DLC heavy/episodic type games.
This is the one item on this list that
makes me feel quite a bit trepidation
about what the future of gaming
may become. I hate hate hate in
game purchases. They just seem a
cheap gimmick for me where the
game creator is trying to rip us off,
especially if I paid a significant amount
of money for said game. I mean, I
understand the concept: some people
have time but no money and some
people have money and time. Both
are currencies that can be traded for
in items. However when the items you
need to progress are only available
through monetary means this is when
I get annoyed. Sadly this method of
making money seems to be working,
and won’t disappear. I really just hope
that game makers still keep in mind
who really plays their games, cues to
get copies and raves to others about it.
This has been the dream of every gamer
since birth. How epic would it be to
actually run through a game, see what
your character sees through their eyes,
and just be so immersed in your game
that you could swear it was reality.
The imminent release of the Oculus
Rift has turned those dreams into
something of a hope that viable virtual
reality will happen in our generation.
This Kickstarter funded device, which
is pretty much a ‘mask’ over your face,
which projects two slightly different
images for each eye. This creates the
illusion that you are actually viewing the
world from the perspective of the game.
So the visual aspect is now sorted. What
is with movement and touch? Well
Kickstarter comes to the rescue again!
The Virtuix Omni, which is pretty much
a glorified treadmill. However it is also
so much more than that. It records your
movement, so when you step in reality,
your in-game character will copy that.
These two things combined seem to
signal the advent of virtual reality. More
than anything, this is what gamers
are demanding from the future. Also,
then exercising will be made so much
interesting and exciting. I mean taking a
run around Skyrim, exploring the caves
andmountainsofthisfantasyworldbeat
London, surrounded by cars and grey
rain,everysingledayoftheyear.Thetwo
big hurdles are, firstly how much will
the big gaming companies invest in this
untested and potentially very expensive
technology. Without the support of the
game studios, no one will ever want any
virtual reality gadget if they can’t play
anything on it. Secondly, how much will
these devices cost the average gamer?
If they are priced out of ever owning
one, then they will be doomed to fail.
No, this is not about mobile gaming.
That is a topic that deserves gaming
article all for its own. Here we are
going to look at the implications
of what it means for hard-core
gaming if you have the addition of
a second screen. The case study I
will present the case of Battlefield
4 (Yes, that game again as well).
The addition of a tablet in the game
process as a general type character
is very interesting and adds an
entire dimension to the gameplay.
However very few other games
have implemented such a feature.
Why not? It is quite enjoyable to
be able to just play with your mates
without having to actually to always
interact directly. This method
of introducing different ways of
playing the same game not only
extends the lifetime of the game
itself as well as encouraging new
players to try it out. Furthermore
as mobile computing becomes
more and more powerful, it seems
that the logical conclusion will be
major games will migrate to solely
occupy this medium. However is
it really? The way we interact with
games e.g. with keyboard/mouse
or controller. Even though you are
distinct from the game, the level
of immersion is still limited. Is
this possible if you are going to be
touching the screen all the time?
Every time you bring that finger
between yourself and the game, you
are reminded that you aren’t in the
game. For now, and the foreseeable
future I think that laptops/desktops
and consoles will dominate
the hard-core gaming market.
