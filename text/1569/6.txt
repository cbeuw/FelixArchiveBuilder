Ants in your pants? That’s crazy...
Christopher Yates reveals Texas’s invasive venom-proof ‘crazy ants’
The pseudoscience shaking the Shroud

razy ants may sound like
a Flappy Bird spin-off,
but in fact this species of
ant is slowly taking over
Texas, thanks in part to
their ability to neutralise the venom
of fire ants.
The red imported fire ant, an
invasive species introduced to the
USA in the 1930s, has a fearsome
bite that causes painful red irritations
in humans and is used to kill other
insects. Their venom contains various
alkaloids, which can lead to allergic
reactions in some cases.
Whilst most ant species are unable
to displace the fire ants, crazy ants
can detoxify their venom, the fire ants’
most powerful weapon. They do this
using formic acid, which they produce
and rub on themselves whenever they
are affected by venom.
Researchers found that preventing
ants producing formic acid by coating
them in nail polish led to venom killing
around half of the ants, compared to
just 2% when the ants could produce
the acid.
Thanks to this acid defence, in 93%
of the cases where fire ants and crazy
ants are competing for the same food,
the crazy ants will be successful. They
can even oust fire ants from their
nests, giving the crazy ants a ready-
made home to enjoy.
Unfortunately, whilst fire ants can
leave their mark with a painful bite,
they tend to stay in their nests and
leave humans undisturbed. Crazy
ants, on the other hand, will nest in
anything available, including cars
or fuse boxes, where they can short-
circuit electronics.
Having first arrived in Texas from
SouthAmericain2002,crazyantshave
spread throughout the state, causing
damages to wildlife and livestock, and
annoyance to residents. Thankfully, it
should take a while for the crazy ant to
completely take over the USA, as they
can only spread at a rate of around
200m a year, although this can be
accelerated if transported by humans,
for example by accidentally hitching a
ride in a car.
Crazy ants aren’t the only ants to
use formic acid, whose name comes
from the Latin formica, meaning ant.
Some ants spray or inject formic acid
as a form of defence, while others even
use it as a herbicide. In the Amazon,
‘devil’s gardens’, named because locals
A
longside UFOs,
homeopathy and all
manners of conspiracy
theories, the Shroud
of Turin has long
been known as a perennial source of
pseudoscience. It has almost certainly
lived up to its well-earned reputation
this week. An army of journalists
have flooded the internet with stories
about a new paper explaining why
radiocarbon dating may not have
given the “right” answer when aging
the religious icon. It already sounds
suspicious, doesn’t it?
For anyone who doesn’t know, the
Shroud of Turin is a burial shroud that
has the outline of a person imprinted
on it, and is believed by some to have
covered Jesus after his crucifixion. In
1988, carbon dating on the shroud
concluded that it originated from
around the 14th
century, considerably
later than the accepted lifetime of
Christ. This, one might assume, should
have been the end of the matter.
Not for Alberto Carpinteri,
however. In his paper, published in
the journal Meccanica (of which he is
the editor-in-chief), he suggests that
a huge number of neutrons released
by an earthquake in 33AD may have
disrupted the ratio of carbon isotopes
and led to a much more recent
estimate of its age.
The idea of a large neutron flux
affectingtheshroudwasfirstdiscussed
in the letters pages of Nature in 1989,
but Carpinteri is the first to put
forward a possible explanation for how
it may have arisen. His theory relies
on something called “piezonuclear
fission”, a phenomenon where
enormous numbers of neutrons can
be released by applying mechanical
forces to rocks, supposedly causing
iron nuclei to break apart. Carpinteri
is definitely a world expert on this: he
came up with the idea several years ago
and still may well be the only scientist
who believes it to be compatible with
the laws of physics.
Aside from the suspicion that
this paper may partly have been
a (remarkably successful) way of
getting more publicity for the author’s
favourite theory, there are more
fundamental problems with the idea
of neutrons affecting the Shroud.
When it was suggested in 1989 by
R.E.M. Hedges, one of those who first
performed the carbon dating on it,
he argued that why wasn’t everything
else in the region also affected and
why did his team just happen to
get an apparently wrong date that
corresponded with the earliest
historical records of the Shroud?
In the greater scheme of things,
stories like this are pretty irrelevant,
but they highlight an important issue
about science in the media. This story
has been covered by several major
news organisations including The
Huffington Post, The Independent,
The Telegraph, USA Today and,
obviously, The Daily Mail. These
are all respected news outlets (OK,
maybe not The Mail...), and yet their
journalists still can’t be bothered to
do a bit of background reading before
publishing an article. In this media
culture obsessed by headlines and
good stories over factual accuracy,
how can the lay readers possibly get
an informed view of the truth behind
any science story?

areas containing only lemon ant trees.
Lemon ants inject formic acid into
the leaves of other trees in the area,
leading to the leaves dying. The ants
can cultivate their preferred trees over
areas up to 1,300m2
, with colonies of
over 3 million worker ants.
