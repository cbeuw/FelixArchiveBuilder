FRIDAY 21 FEB
CATNIP
Ask Annie, your friendly Agony Aunt
Help! My friend and I slept together (as
a one-off), and we didn’t use a condom
because I’m on the pill. At the time I
wasn’t worried, because he’s never
seemed like the type to sleep around.
However, since then, I’ve heard that
he’s been sleeping around, and now
I’m worried that I might have caught
something. Should I be worried?
Risky in Ruislip
It’s always best to get checked after you
have unprotected sex with someone,
because you can never tell from a
person what they might be carrying.
If this person had unprotected (from
STIs) sex with you in this context, you
can reasonably assume that they will
have had unprotected sex with others.
This only increases the risk to you, so
it’s really important that you make
sure that you get tested before you
have unprotected sex with any further
partners.
Help! I’ve been seeing someone for
a month or so, and we text a lot and
spend a lot of time together, sleeping
together a couple of nights a week.
Whenever I try to talk to her about
our relationship, she always changes
the subject. I know that she’s really into
me, how can I convince her to put a
label on it?
Undefined in Upminster
While at first it might seem like if
you just wait, your status will become
apparent, if it’s got to the point where
it’s bothering you, you need to talk
to her. She’s probably avoiding it
because she’s worried that it might be
awkward, or even that she might be
rejected. Unfortunately, you just have
to be really blunt, and just bring it
up. If you’re as into each other as you
think you are, hopefully it won’t be a
very long conversation!
Help, I’m dating an American girl and
I’m worried about her reaction when
she sees my uncircumcised penis. I’m
too shy to mention it to her, but I don’t
want her to be surprised when she
discovers it. Should I mention it to her
in advance?
Uncut in Uxbridge
If she wants your D, she’s not gonna
care about its shape or form. If you’re
really worried about it, try and bring
it up humorously in advance, so she’s
not shocked. Americans often have
a belief that it’s far less clean to be
uncircumcised, but if you explain to
her and reassure her that either way
can be just as hygienic, that should
alleviate any nerves that she has. Plus
you should always remember, pigs in
blankets is the best way to eat meat,
ever.
Help! I’m in the second year of my PhD,
and I’m at a point where I really hate
waking up in the morning because I
know I have to come into college and
work on it. I never get any productive
work done, and I’m depressed all the
time outside college. I hate my PhD,
but I don’t want to quit this far in.
What can I do?
Despondent in Dagenham
This is a really common problem for
second year PhD students. During
such a long project, it’s really easy
to lose track of why you’re doing it.
It’s best to take time to reassess your
reasons for doing a PhD, and why
you chose that project in the first
place. Spend time with your friends,
take a break from the monotony,
and hopefully after a while you’ll be
refreshed and ready to get back into it.
If you’re really struggling after taking
some time out, talk to your supervisor
about it; they might be able to make
suggestions on how to change the
structure of your project to help you
back into it.
Help! My friends used to be really
sociable and fun, but now we’ve hit
third year, no-one ever wants to go out
anymore. I understand that we’ve got
a lot of work to do, but I need to take
a break and do something fun to de-
stress a little bit! How can I convince
them to break the cycle of spending
every night at home?
Bored in Brockley
I don’t understand why you need your
friends to come out with you. Let
your buddies stew in their lab report
and head down to the union bar.
Chances are you are likely to bump
into someone you know, or at least
find a group drunk enough to accept
you into their ranks. So stop trying to
change other people and expecting
your friends to hang out with you.
Though of course, once they see you
going out, they might want to join in
the fun and come with you anyway!
1. You broke up for a reason
At some point, you broke up. At that point, whether it was
in the heat of the moment, or a slow, considered decision,
you realised that you would be better off apart. Now
you’ve been broken up for a while, you’re lonely and you
miss them, and you want to get back together. This doesn’t
remove the validity of the decision, and being broken up
for a while won’t fix the problems that you were having
before. You decided that these problems were more than
you could bear, you’ll only be making yourself miserable if
you go back on that decision now.
2. Do you want to be that person?
If you get back together, everyone will assume that
you’ve begged and grovelled until your ex would take you
back (regardless of who broke up with whom, or what
happened). This is degrading and humiliating, and really
not something that you want. You might think that you’re
willing to deal with that now, but when you look back,
you’ll regret it.
3. Why not try someone else?
There are seven billion people in the world, why are you
settling for just one, and one that at some point you decided
wasn’t good enough? Romantically speaking, if they’ve
broken your heart, they’re not The One, and you should
move on until you find them. Or if you’re more scientific,
statistically speaking, there’s bound to be someone better,
who’s not shit. So don’t do it, yeah?
