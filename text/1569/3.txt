mperial surgeon Mr. Hutan
Ashrafian has recently diagnosed
a picture of Leonardo Da Vinci’s
Vitruvian Man, saying in an
email to the Huffington Post:
“I noticed that Leonardo da Vinci’s
image of a man had a feature that may
have been pathological.
Notably a lump in the left groin
region, For an adult male that
Leonardo was depicting, a lump in
the groin of this nature is most likely
diagnosed as a hernia”. The surgeon
then went on to suggest that the
drawing could have been based on
the cadaver of a man who might have
died from a hernia. Mr. Ashrafian,
a Clinical Lecturer in Surgery has
also recently published an academic
paper about Arius of Alexandra, the
first reported mortality from rectal
prolapse.
T
he Chemistry and Materials
Departments have shown
a marked improvement
from the number of final
year students who have
completed the National Student
Survey. At the time of writing,
Chemistry had achieved 93.54%
participation, 23.9% higher that last
year’s final figure. In comparison the
department of Materials has seen a
smaller gain of 4.46% over last year’s
78.87% figure.
The Department of Earth Science
and Engineering (ESE) remains at the
top of the leaderboard with another
year of full participation from finalists.
On the other hand Biology currently
needs over 69% of students to fill out
the NSS in order to reach last year’s
80.61% high.
There was some controversy at the
startofthesessionwhensomestudents
were temporarily unable to fill out the
survey because the government had
not processed changes to their degree
length.
Additionally, some students
(including those on year abroad
schemes) have been forced to fill out
the NSS a year early since Ipsos MORI
has been unable to remove them from
the survey.
Nat Kempston, the Union’s Deputy
President (Education) told Felix: “NSS
participation is going really well so far,
I am pleased with the progress in the
majority of departments. Life Sciences
are not promoting the survey until
March when they have finished their
Final exams so this accounts for their
low participation rates. Therefore it
is Mech Eng, Maths and Physics that
are the departments we need to focus
on. This year we have put the graph
on Blackboard so students can view
participation rates easily, as well as
keeping other publicity methods from
previous years.
The Faculty of Natural Sciences
are offering £5 for every student
who fills in the NSS, which goes to
their Dep Soc or towards an end of
year party (Maths), and many other
departments are offering rewards
for participation (Bioengineering are
giving out t-shirts!). We will see where
departments end up on April 30!”
The National Student Survey,
commissioned by the Higher
Education Funding Council for
England, started in late January
and is set to close on April 30, final
years can access the survey at: www.

Union submits portfolio of evidence to
College’s Residential Experience Review
T
he Residential Experience
review was announced by
College at the start of the
year. The aim of this review
is to improve the residential
experience students at Imperial have.
The Union were asked to submit
evidence for the review, which was
bought to Union Council last week
and approved for submission.
The Union’s evidence was split
into three categories: Undergraduate
Halls, Postgraduate Halls and Beyond
Halls. A draft was taken to the Union’s
Executive Committee for discussion,
where the spectrum of information
was approved and the Deputy
President (Welfare) was asked to write
the report.
However, the time frame given to
the Sabbatical officers to undertake
this work was very short, and they
were unable undertake a full student

E
arlier this week the
London Student revealed
that Imperial College has
£785,000 indirectly invested
in tobacco companies. This
conflicts with the extensive cancer
research done by Imperial academics.
The investment is split between
investment firms, the College has a
£505,000 share in British American
Tobacco, a £182,000 stake in Imperial
Tobacco group and £98,000 in
Reynolds American.
We spoke to a College spokesperson
who released the following statement
about the investments: “It is Imperial
College policy to neither undertake
research to develop or promote
tobacco products nor to directly invest
in tobacco companies.
The College Endowment has a
responsibility to optimise investment
return to support the College’s
academic mission, and it therefore
holds some investments in managed
funds. The College has no control over
the composition of those funds, which
change on a continual basis.”
consultation. Therefore, the evidence
was taken from survey data and areas
to be investigated were suggested. The
review submission document contains
is a detailed 63 page document
in which the Union “highlight[s]
evidence from a wide range of sources
which are relevant to the wider student
experience”.
Some points that were suggested
to the panel included reviewing the
cleaning provisions in halls, the high
cost of rents for postgraduate students
living in GradPad and a potential rent
guarantor scheme for students not
living in Halls.
The Union also explained its main
recommendation, which was that “the
review group commission full scale
and extensive consultation with the
student body based upon a specific set
of options, all of which are realistic
to achieve”.

Union’s submission to the panel,

Office of Fair
Trading claims
sanctions on
students in debt
unlawful
Joe Letts
Editor-in-Chief
A
fter analysing the
terms and conditions
of over 100 UK Higher
Education Institutions,
the Office of Fair
Trading (OFT) concluded that almost
75% included sections that could stop
students graduating or progressing to
the next year of study if they were in
debt to their institution.
The OFT stated that “the blanket
use of academic sanctions in
such instances, regardless of the
circumstances,couldbreachconsumer
protection law”.
The circumstances in which students
can be sanctioned include owing fines
for late library books or childcare
services and non-academic debt.
A paper submitted to the Union’s
Executive Committee last August
revealed that no student at Imperial
has been prevented from graduating
of progressing because of outstanding
academic charges.
