Best film of all time?
Citizen Kane follows the story of a
journalist trying to piece together the
life of Charles Foster Kane and try to
figure out what his final word, “Rose-
bud”, meant. It has been critically ac-
claimed and has often been labelled
the best film of all time by many.
If one has never seen the film before;
it is difficult to view it without think-
ing “Am I enjoying this enough con-
sidering it’s the best film of all time?!”
Moments when the film lulls a little
you begin to wonder whether you are
just not getting it. These things are
hard not to think about. On top of this
there are so many tropes and lines of
dialogue that have been parodied and
pastiche’d in modern cinema it can be
difficult to concentrate. Whether the
musical number that has been paro-
died by The Simpsons or the famous
ending which pops up just about
damn everywhere.
I have to say despite these reserva-
tions I did very much enjoy the film,
but probably laughed a few more
times than Welles intended due to a
weird anachronistic call-back humour
from the parodies.
Though worry if I didn’t enjoy would
I ever say? Could it all be a giant case
of the Emperor’s new clothing? Am I
deceiving myself? Did the critic James
Agate get it right in 1941 when he said:
“I thought the photography quite
good, but nothing to write to Moscow
about, the acting middling, and the
whole thing a little dull.”
Are we watching this movie for the
same reasons that people feel com-
pelled to queue for a few hours to see
Mona Lisa in the Louvre? Just because
we’ve been told it’s the best. They are
both highlights in their art form, but
do people enjoy them or just want to
be able to say “Been there, done that”?
I think it is problematic to try and
hold one film up as “The Best”, as it
does a disservice to many other films
that might be enjoyed as much or
have just as much merit in their era.
It also acts as a distraction from the
enjoyment of the film, though it is
always difficult to recommend films
without leading the person viewing
to think about them in a certain way.
Sometimes the best films are the ones
which you knew nothing about before
starting. My first memory of The Shin-
ing was channel-hopping and seeing a
movie starting and thinking “that’ll
do”. Only to totally blown away by it.
Maybe there just needs to be more
ways to access good film blindly.
It would be great if Netflix were to
introduce a random classic movie but-
ton, it might help me finally help me
get over this problem. (Can I patent
that…?)
