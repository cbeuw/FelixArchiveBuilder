N
ext week is Student
Volunteering Week
(SVW), a nationwide
celebration of the
power of student
volunteering. Imperial College
London is one of many universities
celebrating SVW, with activities
coordinated by students from Imperial
Hub’s Local Action Committee in
collaboration with the Union. We’re
aiming to showcase the diverse
positive impact that we can make in
our local communities, inspire new
or further engagement with social
issues, and highlight how easy it is to
get involved as a student. The week
is organised by students for students,
and whether you volunteer weekly,
in the holidays, or not at all, there’s
something for everyone.
For students on Imperial Hub’s Local
Action Committee, it’s exciting that
the week has finally arrived. Planning
for SVW began back in November
with weekly meetings to decide the
aims and put together a programme
of events to engage a wide range of
their fellow students. They were also
committed to showcasing the efforts
of current student volunteers and
have partnered with a number of
student groups to raise awareness of
their opportunities throughout the
week. You might not realise that there
are nearly 3,500 Imperial students
who volunteer through the Union
or Imperial Hub. From delivering
the Union’s services and activities to
tackling social and environmental
issues, these students demonstrate
a commitment to going above and
beyond for others.
In preparation for the week, the
SVW team interviewed Imperial
students who volunteer in a range
of different projects. Sijia Yu, a first
year biologist, is involved in Imperial
Hub’s Schools Plus programme. She
is one of 150 Imperial students who
provide 800+ hours of free tuition
each term to disadvantaged pupils
in local schools and community
organisations. She described her
experience: “I volunteer in the First
Georgian supplementary school as a
Science and Maths tutor. Nearly all
the students have Georgian bloodline,
most of them cannot speak English
very well and can’t understand some
scientific terms due to the language
barrier. I try to use simple words or
synonyms to explain a concept when
they feel confused, and I have found
graphs and videos to be very useful.
Two months ago, the school set up
wifi, so we are now able to show
students the relevant images when
they have no idea what a word means.
In addition, sometimes I use Russian
to assist tuition because most students
there speak Russian; it is unusual, but
it does work! Nevertheless, all of the
volunteers are always trying their very
best to help these students.”
There is no doubt that the
volunteers make a positive impact
on the pupils they tutor. A teacher in
North Kensington told us, “Our pupils
enjoy working with Imperial students
because they are passionate about
their subjects. Having young tutors
means that pupils can relate to them
and we really appreciate their time
and efforts.”
Another student that was
interviewed, William Brown, a
Chemical Engineering undergrad
and chair of tutoring project TEAM
Students emphasised the skills
you can gain from volunteering.
“Volunteers learn at least as much
as their pupils. Our volunteers come
from many different backgrounds
and all have different reasons for
joining, but a common theme is
the strong desire to help those less
fortunate and our project as a whole
is a very powerful manifestation of
this desire. Tuition teaches patience,
professionalism, flexibility and
time management skills – all very
important for a student’s personal
development.”
Matthew Proctor, a second year
physicist who volunteers at the
Imperial College Cooperative
stall on Thursdays in Sherfield,
shared similar views. “I think
student volunteering is an excellent
opportunity to meet new friends and
develop your skills. It gives me the
chance to work with a brilliant group
of intelligent, interesting, and funny
students who are very passionate
about their work. It’s also fun. With
such a tough degree that sometimes
gets overwhelming, working on the
stall is something I look forward
to every week and it’s just such an
enriching experience that I’d highly
recommend to anyone thinking
about volunteering.”
Off campus, the student group
Soup Run provides food, drink and
company to local homeless and
vulnerable people. Heather Jeffery,
Soup Run Coordinator, explained,
“The Soup Run gives Imperial students
the opportunity to do something
completely different to their studies.
Volunteering in the community is
personally rewarding and it makes a
difference to the lives of those in need.”
Maddy Maxwell, a second year
Medic who is coordinating SVW
through Imperial Hub, said: “We
believe that the number of Imperial
student volunteers and the impact
that they make is underestimated, so
we’re looking forward to using SVW
to showcase the diverse positive
impact that we can make in our local
communities, inspire new or further
engagement with social issues, and
highlight how easy it is to get involved
as a student both during the week and
beyond.”
Interacting with your local
community outside of the lecture
theatre, laboratory or library can be
hugely valuable and SVW is all about
giving every Imperial student a chance
to try something new. As well as on-
campus events, you can get involved
in our local boroughs of Kensington
and Chelsea and Hammersmith and
Fulham, as well as in Westminster,
Camden, Hillingdon, Islington, Tower
Hamlets, Southwark and Lambeth.
Beyond SVW
The good news is that the fun
doesn’t stop when the week finishes.
You can continue to make the most
of your time at Imperial and get to
know the community you study and
live in. By volunteering, you can make
a difference to an issue you care about
or ignite a passion you didn’t know you
had; it will provide you with a wealth
of skills outside of your academic
life and is a great way to boost your
employability. It’s flexible, hugely
rewarding and gives you the chance
to experience a new industry or sector
– you can even gain an accreditation
for your efforts through the Union’s
Imperial Plus scheme or Imperial
Hub’s Social Leadership Award.
