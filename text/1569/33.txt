Keep Calm And Eat Chips
Felix Food tells you all about the crispy potatoes pieces
O
h chips, glorious chips.
The humble deep
fried potato strips
have been one of the
most accessible and
consumed foods across the world. It
also provides a great subject for banter
when stealing your friends’ chips
becomes the top priority in the pub.
As we near the end of the National
Chip Week, it is perhaps time to take
a deeper look into the world of chips.
Where did it come from?
To really understand the history of
chips, we need to look into the “mother
hen” – potatoes. It is believed that
potatoes originated in the Andes of
South America around 8000 years ago.
TheSpanishconquistadorsbroughtthe
vegetable back to Europe in 1536 and
it was first grown in London in 1597.
The idea of deep frying chips was
from France or Belgium. One of the
stories is that it was invented by street
vendors on the Pont Neuf bridge in
Paris in 1789, just before the French
revolution. The chips became a
fundamental part of the American
fast food thanks to Thomas Jefferson,
who served them in the White House
during his time in office between 1801
and 1809, making it trendy at the time.
In Britain, the first chips were fried
in around 1860 in Oldham, which is
also where the first Fish and Chip shop
opened for business. British chips are
cut much thicker and, since the surface
to volume ratio is lower, they have a
lower fat content. So next time when
you feel like something greasy, go for
chunky chips; they’re less bad for you!
Are they really potatoes?
Well, supposedly, yes. Traditionally
(and still in practice by some
restaurants) chips are fried twice,
once to cook the potatoes and again
to give it the crisp texture and golden
colour. Quite often most of us will
find frying a bit too much of a hassle,
so that’s where frozen chips come in.
Sold in most supermarkets
nowadays, it is estimated that 80% of
households in the UK buy frozen chips
as a substitute to making them from
scratch. These oven chips are sliced,
dried and par-fried so that they are
crisp on the outside but remain raw
on the inside. This means the cooking
process is a lot shorter and more
convenient for a weeknight meal.
Most fast food outlets and some pubs
and takeaways have seen this as a way
to increase efficiency between order
and plate and to minimise cost – for
example, McDonald’s replaced fresh
cut potatoes with frozen fries in 1967;
othersfollowedsuitnotsoonafterthat.
Unlike“powderedmashedpotatoes”,
there is no evidence so far that there
are chips on the market that are made
from reformed potato starch, or other
ingredients that are totally unrelated,
perhaps because it has to stay in the
chip shape and therefore reducing the
incentive for doing so. However, there
are reports that Burger King started
spraying a coat of starch to keep
the chips hot and crispy for longer.
Homemade healthier chips
So one evening, we felt a crave
of burgers and chips, so we made
some! If you feel like doing something
simple this weekend and don’t feel
like buying pre-made “stuff” off the
shelf, here is a quick recipe to cook.
Ingredients (for 1-2):
- 1 small onion
- 250g beef mince
- 1 egg
- 4 potatoes (depends how big your
appetite is!)
For the burger, dice the onion and
mix it with the beef and egg. Then
divide the mixture into two. With
slightly wet hands, roll the mixtures
into balls sized around a tennis ball.
Set in the palm of your hand and
gently squeeze down to flatten into
patties around 3cm thick. Make sure
both burgers are the same thickness
so they cook evenly. Pan fry for
around 5 minutes on both sides –
depends how well done you like it.
As for chips, chop the potatoes into
chip shape and boil for 3-5 minutes.
It doesn’t really matter what potatoes
you use, but desiree potatoes are
recommended since they have a firmer
and creamier texture – in this case, we
just got a baking potato from the local
supermarket. Drain them and shake
them out onto a roasting pan, drizzle
with oil and season well. We added a
bit of curry powder to spice things up
a bit, you can add any herbs and spices
if you wish! Put it in the oven at 200
degrees for about half an hour, or until
golden brown and crisp. Don’t forget
to turn them at least twice to make
sure they are crispy all the way round!
Safety First!
If you do decide to fry chips this
weekend, please remember never fill
the pan over a third full with oil or fat,
and never be tempted to cook with
a chip pan after consuming alcohol.

Also, don’t leave the pan alone with
the heat on, and be sure to cool down
the pan if the oil starts smoking.
If it does catch on fire, don’t panic,
don’t take risks and don’t move the
pan. Never throw water or use a fire
extinguisher on a hot fat fire and,
only if it is safe to do so, turn off the
heat. Leave the kitchen, close the door
behind you, tell everyone else in the
home to get out. Don’t go back inside
for any reason and call 999.
Will it blend was probably one of the
most popular channels on YouTube –
but will it post? Well someone found
out by posting a banana to his friend.
Gavine Morton, a tap dance
teacher, decided to play the joke
“just to make people that saw the
banana smile”. He even wrote “Do
not bend” on the banana to ensure

the fruit was delivered in one piece.
Since the correct postage was paid,
Royal Mail did deliver the banana
across Scotland. The banana was
slightly too big for the letter box so
luckily someone was at the house
and no awkward red slip was left. The
banana did survive its 81-mile journey,
just a little bruised but still edible!
Are you a keen Instagrammer
who takes photos of your dish
whenever you eat out? Well if you
do that in a posh French restaurant,
the head chef might storm out
of the kitchen shouting angrily.
Gilles Goujon and Alexandre
Gauthier, both respected chefs
with Michelin stars, argue that
it is poor etiquette to do so and
posting photos online “takes away
the surprise and a bit of intellectual
properties”. Alexandre even added
a “no camera” logo on his menu.
But not all chefs have the same view,
some see this as an opportunity for free
publicity, while others provide food
photography classes with the meal.
