FRIDAY 21 FEB
FILM
The best BLOCKbuster
The Hobbit: The Desolation of
Smaug
It’s the end of an era! We’ve come to
the finish of our spring term line-up
but before you sob into your library
cafécoffeesrememberthatthespring
all-nighter is coming! With all things
Oscar as our theme and a remarkably
strong caliber of films to choose from,
trust me this is not something you
want to be missing…
The Hobbit: The Desolation of
Smaug should need no introduction
but in case you’ve been living under
a rock since before the age of middle
earth, I’m going to be giving you one
anyway:
Bilbo Baggins is on a mad mission
to help the company of dwarves
reclaim the Lonely Mountain and its
bountiful treasures from Smaug-an
ancient and evil dragon. This results
in them spending a lot of their time
being chased by a variety of orcs
who are not particularly fond of their
plans. Meanwhile, leading on from
the previous film, Bilbo has managed
to acquire the mystical ring that is the
source of all the problems to come
and he begins to feel its corrupting
influence.
The Hobbit: The Desolation of
Smaug: 25th February (Tuesday) and
27th February (Thursday) at 19:00

Two of my favourite things in the
entire world are Lego and films. It is
probably for this reason that the idea
of a Lego movie had me worried.
Learning that Phil Lord and Chris-
topher Miller - the creative geni-
uses behind Cloudy with a Chance of
Meatballs and 21 Jump Street - were
making it, went some way to reassure
me, but going into the cinema I still
had no idea what to expect. And what
I got was so much better than any-
thing I could have hoped for.
The film opens in a Lego volcano
filled with Lego lava and Lego rocks
(sensing a theme here?) where Presi-
dent Business (Will Ferrell) is stealing
the Kragle from Vitruvius (Morgan
Freeman). With this strange object,
President Business has the ability to
destroy the universe. But it’s okay, be-
cause there is a totally-true-because-
it-rhymes prophesy about the exist-
ence of the most important person
ever, the “Special One with face of yel-
low” who is destined to save the world.
Now we meet a construction worker
called Emmet (Chris Pratt) who, like
everyone else, spends his entire life
following the instructions written by
President Business. His life suddenly
changes when he accidently runs into
the beautiful Wyldstyle (she’s got a
boyfriend though, and it’s super seri-
ous) and discovers a mysterious brick
known as the Piece of Resistance.
With this in hand, Emmet must team
up with an eclectic group of Master
Builders including Princess Unikitty,
Metalbeard, Benny the astronaut and
Batman to save the day. But to do this
they will have to infiltrate President
Business’ tower, a building with every
kind of protection imaginable. Sharks.
Lasers. Sharks with lasers. Will our
team of heroes be able to stop the
villain in time? I guess you’ll have to
watch to find out.
Not only is the story both enter-
taining and engaging, the animation
style is utterly gorgeous. Everything is
made out of Lego. And I mean every-
thing. The buildings, the cars, the wa-
ter, the food and of course the people.
The directors also manage to bring
together a broad range of characters
from a ridiculous number of fran-
chises and weave them into a cohesive
whole. How many other films will get
to watch that include conversations
between Gandalf and Dumbledore,
or C3P0 and Batman? Somehow these
bit parts manage to never feel forced
or unnecessary, injecting humour into
the script without bogging it down
with too many people. For those of
you who collect the Lego minifigures,
be on the lookout for your favourites
as many of them have cameos if not
speaking roles.
Overall, I cannot begin to express
how much I loved this film. It was silly
and colourful and touching all at the
same time. Even if cartoon films aren’t
usually the sort of thing you go for be-
cause you are much too grown up for
‘kids’ films’, I implore you try this one.
It isn’t a kids film. It’s a film for every-
one, and everyone should see it. Why?
To quote the theme song: “everything
is awesome!”
