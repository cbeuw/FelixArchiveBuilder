FRIDAY 21 FEB
COMMENT
N
umbers. To the average
Imperial student, they
are part of everyday
academia, to others
they are enthralling
and engaging, but for some of us they
represent a punitive regime by which
we live. Numbers are our self-worth,
our being, our everything. Kilos,
calories, clothes size. Small numbers
are our friends, zero is our deity. We
are more common than you think: we
have eating disorders.
Eatingdisordersaffectapproximately
1.6 million people in the UK yet they
are still not understood by the masses.
Personally, I know of at least 4 people
who suffer, or have suffered, from an
eating disorder at Imperial, yet there
is no support available or awareness
on campus. I struggle to understand
why this is the case: Imperial is the
perfect breeding ground for eating
disorders. It is high pressured and
competitive; everybody strives to
be the best. Everybody wants to be
perfect. Personally, I have found this
environment triggering and earlier
this year found myself in the grips of
anorexia once again.
Having an eating disorder is a
terrifying and isolating experience
no matter who you are. Nonetheless,
battling an eating disorder alongside
the gruelling workload and
intense pressure of College life is
inconceivably arduous. I simply could
not manage both, something had to
give. Studying requires concentration
and cognitive clarity. Eating disorders,
when unmanaged, abduct this. You
become nothing more than a hollow
shell consumed by consumption.
Fortunately, I was able to identify
the downwards spiral in which I was
caught and with the support of friends
and family I chose to embark on the
path to recovery. I felt ashamed; I
had come to university three years
free of treatment. I thought I was
recovered, how did I end up back in
entrails of anorexia? It was a place I
swore never to be again. I realise now
that this doesn’t matter - what matters
is that I identified the problem and I
am making positive changes. I am
tentatively embracing university life
once again. I am not recovered by any
means, but I am in control.
I wanted to write this article for
Eating Disorder Awareness Week
not only to raise awareness but to
share my story with others who are
suffering. To let them know that
they are not alone in this, that if they
chose it, there is hope, and to share
some advice on how to survive at
university with an eating disorder. My
first piece of advice is to speak out, do
not suffer alone. Telling other people
is an important step in admitting
your struggles to yourself. Moreover,
recovering alone is impossible - my
friends have helped me so much,
without them I’d still be in a very dark
place. Secondly, think about what you
want from university. Having an eating
disorder not only affects your grades
but it also engulfs the whole student
experience. Do you want to look back
and regret wasting ‘the best years of
your life’ staying in to avoid calories?
My third recommendation is to go to
the GP, get professional support. Do
not take no for answer. Do not go back
when ‘you’ve lost more weight.’ Early
intervention is key, let the GP and
your demons know your problems
are just as serious as anybody else’s.
Furthermore, I strongly suggest
speaking to your senior or personal
tutor: it helps to remove some of the
academic pressure.
Finally, make yourself rules.
Sensible ones, healthy ones and stick
to them. Having a routine makes food
more manageable.
The road to recovery is a long one,
it is far from smooth, and there are
days when giving up is so appealing.
At university there is nobody there
to make you eat, to stop you from
purging or tell you sit down. You have
to take responsibility. You have to
make positive changes for yourself.
You have to recover because you want
to, not because you are being forced.
Ultimately, you have to take control.

Another week passes...
T
he weather is still horrid.
Seriously, you’d have
thought that things
would have cleared up
by now.
Anyway, this week’s been an
interesting one, with a hugely
successful “Rep Week”, including
theRepConferenceonWednesday.
We also have another Photo of
the Week and more lonely hearts
from Catnip :)
If you want to get involved with
Felix, don’t forget that it’s not to
late to do so, all you have to do is
send us an email (there are email
addresses all over the paper)
and tell us how you want to get
involved.
Until next time!
