Director Joshua Oppenheimer shows
us that documentary making isn’t just
about fly on the wall people watching
and talking heads. He throws himself,
and us, right into the fray with the
most unlikeable, disgusting and
villainous humans imaginable and yet
he finds humanity in them.
The film is the story of the
Indonesian Genocide told from
the point of some of the men who
perpetrated it and who have gone
legally unpunished.
They are then asked to reenact the
murders they perpetrated in the style
of their favourite Hollywood movies.
When they start looking at the tapes
they reflect for the first time on what
theyhavedone.Itseemstobethefirst
time these men start to understand
what they have done and shows that
though they have gone unpunished
by courts the toll it has taken on their
psyche is massive.
These man are not portrayed with
sympathy, but I think it’s a movie that
starts to ask question about what
motivates people and how normal
people can end up committing the
worst kind of crimes. When we filed
outthePantonStreetOdeoneveryone
was in silence, it was haunting. I felt
torn between such anger and such
sadness and the film sat with me for
weeks. I still find myself churning
over what it contained and what it
means. Apologies for not knowing
who this quote is paraphrased from
but basically “It’s a horrifying film,
but you don’t get to not see it,”
There’s a reason that films nowadays
are rarely about love, and why love is
usually just a side-plot in a story that
tackles broader problems. It’s because
love stories are so easy to get wrong -
it’s too easy to drop in a bad clichéd
line in the dialogue, and too easy to re-
solve a plot strand in an obvious way.
Sometimes we’ll enjoy seeing what we
expected to see, because sometimes
it’s just pleasing that way. But most of
the time, we’re left wondering why all
the dramatic tension was built up in
the first place.
[Spoilers follow]
With that in mind, Her is brilliant.
It’s funny, sad, and with an eyebrow-
raising premise, it really makes you
think. Directed by Spike Jonze (Be-
ing John Malkovich), the film tells the
story of Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix),
a lonely man who falls in love with an
operating system...who returns his
affection and falls in love with him
too. Though not explicitly stated, it’s
apparent the film is set in a not-so-
distant future, given that it features
a society who have created, and be-
come very dependent on, technol-
ogy more advanced than what we
currently interact with. This OS that
Theodore becomes enamoured with
can be more accurately described as
a new artificial intelligence system,
‘Samantha’, played by Scarlett Johans-
son. Samantha doesn’t have a face, or a
body (which she frequently complains
about), so we and Theodore never see
her; we only hear her sweet, sultry
voice.
Spike Jonze, in his solo screenwrit-
ing debut, has created a love story
so beautiful that at times we forget
that Samantha isn’t a physical per-
son. Since the premise allows for her
to develop emotions and desires just
like any ordinary human, Samantha
is essentially a whole consciousness
trapped in a machine. She’s lines of
code struggling to accept that they’re
lines of code. This ability of artificial
intelligence is usually described as
‘simulation of human emotion’ - the
Could you love her?
reason being that Samantha isn’t feel-
ing emotion - she’s simulating the
feeling of emotion. But then, can’t it
be argued that we do exactly the same
thing? The brain is nothing more than
parts - lobes - communicating via
nervous signals the same way elec-
tronic components do through wires
- right? So human emotion is nothing
more than a simulation resulting from
the brain’s electrical activity, isn’t it?
But I digress. The bond Theodore
forms with Samantha is so strong and
real, we’re forced to repeatedly remind
ourselves that, however genuine her
emotions are, Samantha is still just
software, and this is what sustains the
sad, troubling undertone that exists
throughout the film. A film that makes
you fall for a character without a face
or a body, in a world that’s otherwise
exactly like ours. A film that makes
you question the nature of relation-
ships and what it means to be human.
In this way, Her is also a subtle anal-
ysis of the human condition. For ex-
ample, [SPOILERS] Theodore writes
personal love letters for a living. He’s
an employee at a company who pro-
vide a service to people who struggle
to express and communicate their
feelings. The film’s opening shot is of
Theodore speaking in a sweet, roman-
tic way; it’s touching, until we realise
he’s reading one of his letters. It’s a
darkly funny scene, but it’s also quite
unsettling, and it made me question
what genuine expression of emotion
really is. But you might find yourself
thinking about it differently.
The film features a relatively small,
but wonderful cast, with no subpar
performances. Joaquin Phoenix plays
Theodore brilliantly, allowing us to
truly empathise with his character,
while Amy Adams plays his longtime
friend, and Rooney Mara plays his
estranged wife. And then there’s Sa-
mantha, who was initially voiced by
Samantha Morton during filming, but
then recast to Scarlett Johansson in
post-production. The recast resulted
in some alterations to the script and
new scenes had to be shot, but in
my opinion, it was the best decision
Jonze made. Johansson is brilliant in
her role, showing off an ability to por-
tray a variety of emotions varying in
strength, through simple nuances in
her voice. Plus. her voice has a great
natural, sweet, flirty quality that al-
lows the audience to really admire her
as a genuine personality, and thus for-
give Theodore for falling in love with
a computer.
Given the bizarre premise, this film
could’ve easily turned out bad, so it’s
really a statement to Jonze’s ingenuity
that Her is now in the running for Best
Picture and Best Original Screenplay
at this year’s Academy Awards. It’s
funny when it needs to be, it’s sweet
and sad, and it’s deeper than I’d ever
expected.

1. Blue is the Warmest Colour
Best films of 2013

When I was writing this list, I found
it difficult to cast my mind back to
2013. With the past month seeing
the release of films such as 12 Years
a Slave, Inside Llewyn Davis, and The
Wolf of Wall Street, 2014 has gone off
with a bang that can make last year’s
output seem slight in comparison.
However, I haven’t yet seen a film
that can match the emotional
intensity of Abdellatif Kechiche’s
Blue is the Warmest Colour, a three-
hour long romantic epic, detailing all
the minutiae of first love. It earned
its share of acclaim and controversy,
with the lengthy sex scenes coming
under fire by some critics, but at
the heart of the film we have two
absolutely mind-numbingly fantastic
performances from Lea Seydoux and
newcomer Adele Exarchopoulos,
who manage to express all the pain
and joy that love can bring. Kechiche
crafts the film with an intimate and
naturalistic feel that belies its lengthy
running time; Blue is the Warmest
Colour is a landmark film, and
completely deserves its spot at the
top of my list.
