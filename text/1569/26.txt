I don’t usually enjoy westerns but
Django Unchained was simply
awesome. Director Quentin
Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir
Dogs, Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds)
has truly outdone himself getting
someone like me to enjoy such a film.
I usually go for the girly, often vom-
inducing films, as evidenced by some
of the more embarrassing entries on
my list (Les Mis, The Great Gatsby,
The Heat etc) and yet Django is the
one that stays with me after all this
time (this was released way back in
January 2013).
It’s a 165-minute long epic of a freed
slave on a mission to rescue his wife.
Packed with excellent performances
(from Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz
and of course, my fav Leonardo
DiCaprio), wonderfully written
wordy script, and an unforgettable
action sequence to wrap it all up, this
was an easy decision.
Nick Frost finally gets his first lead
role in a film. That’s pretty much the
main point of Cuban Fury, and easily
the strongest reason to either see it or
hear of it. Hence why I said it first. No
point in wasting words, really. Which
I’m totally not. Honest. Maybe a little
bit. Over-extended joke aside, seeing
Frost finally take stage is definitely the
best thing about Cuban Fury. It’s got
a strong central trio, all with back-
grounds in some of the best comedies
from either side of the Atlantic (IT
Crowd for Chris O’Dowd, Parks and
Recreation – quite possibly the great-
est show about government not to fea-
ture Malcolm Tucker (which is a stu-
pidly long way of saying ‘best political
satire outside of The Thick of It’) – for
Rashida Jones, and the Cornetto Tril-
ogy for Frost).
Unfortunately, none of the three re-
ally feel like they’re being played to
their respective strengths. O’Dowd’s
new position as Hollywood’s favourite
Irishman (Thor is a huge step-up from
The IT Crowd whichever way you look
at it) combined with (what can only be
read as) a need to avoid type-casting
leaves him playing an utter asshole,
in sharp contrast to his previous self-
absorbed but harmless selves, and it
means some of Cuban Fury’s humour
has an oddly nasty streak in his digs
at Frost’s adorable Bruce. Some of his
quips are mildly amusing, but they’re
mostly just mean and (while it’s obvi-
ously intended to make us dislike him)
can’t help but briefly alter the over-
riding sense of positivity into some-
thing… less positive. Jones, mean-
while, gets handed her mostly straight
role from Parks, where she plays off
against the ever-amazing Amy Po-
ehler, except she… doesn’t really get
anyone to play off. She feels kind of
wasted, to be honest. Just a pretty love
interest who can dance.
Which does bring us rather neatly on
to Cuban Fury’s strongest element be-
sides the existence of Frost (who also
feels wasted, for the record – he came
up with the idea in a drunken email
to a producer, and on paper it’s great,
but without Simon Pegg or the usual
absurdly high quantities of genius
that go into their scripts to work with
he feels a little undercut by the weak
script he’s given here) – the dancing.
It’s great. Smartly shot to disguise the
use of body doubles at various points
(although there are moments where
it’s quite clearly not the various actors
involved), it’s the source of all the best
moments in the film – the roof-top
dance-off between Frost and O’Dowd
is the film’s highlight, by far, and the
final competition scenes are a visual
treat – but for a film built around
the concept there’s surprisingly little
Getting hot in here
dancing. Which is a bit disappoint-
ing, really. It’d have been quite nice to
see something that wasn’t just another
bloody Step Up film. Which are great
if you like dancing, but terrible if you
like pretty much anything else that a
film needs to be even bearable. Like
acting. Or a story (unless you count
‘DANCING’ as a story in which case
you are either a) an idiot b) overly ob-
sessed with dancing c) someone who
doesn’t know what ‘story’ actually
means or d) just trying to wind me
up, in which case: fair play to you. Just
don’t do it again, because you’re only
making yourself look silly)).
“A bit disappointing, really” essen-
tially sums up Cuban Fury. The sup-
porting cast are almost wasted – Ol-
ivia Coleman appears, disappears,
then pops up again later without re-
ally getting a chance to make an im-
pression, Rory Kinnear is just kind of
there sometimes, and while Kayvan
Novak is a great new discovery when
you realise his character mostly con-
sists of openly embracing a stereotype
the jokes start to fall somewhat flat.
Which, again, sort of sums up Cuban
Fury. It’s a film that means so well, and
has such a great cast, that it can’t help
but make you smile, meaning it man-
ages the dubious feat of somehow be-
ing funny without being funny. It feels
very much like a missed opportunity,
but one that’s still probably worth a
watch if you’re looking for a harm-
less, smile-inducing rom-com. It’s far
politer than That Awkward Moment,
and it’s far from being as terrible as the
majority of rom-coms (a genre with
more than its fair share of utter trash),
but it’s no (500) Days of Summer or
Don Jon. Which is a shame, really. It
could have been so much more.

Getting an Academy Award
nomination in each acting category
(Best Leading Actor, Best Leading
Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best
Supporting Actress) is an honour
that does not come around very
often, but David O. Russell has reeled
in such award-worthy performances,
a year after he managed the same
with Silver Linings Playbook.
Based on the 1970s ABSCAM sting
operation that took down several
corrupt members of the Congress
whowereacceptingbribes,American
Hustle is a riotously funny, brilliantly
paced, and a sassy, smart heist film
with a killer sound track that gets
everything right.
It’ssoldasacomedy,andreallythat’s
the main appeal, but behind every
character there is something deeper
and more profound to say, which is
where the talented cast comes in to
shine. Even Jeremy Renner, who isn’t
getting any individual recognition
for his performance, is a triumph,
along with all of his award-winning
co-stars.
