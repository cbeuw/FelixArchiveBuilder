Premier League Predictions

Chelsea vs. Everton
(BT Sport 1, Saturday 12:45pm)
Everton remain in the hunt for Cham-
pions League football but a few lack-
lustre performances of late have
jeopardised their chances. Roberto
Martinez’s men have had longer to
prepare but without Romelu Lukaku,
they lack that all-important cutting
edge. With recent draws against West
Brom and West Ham, Jose Mourinho
has already spurned two chances to
open up a gap at the top of the table,
and he will allow no room for compla-
cency here.
2-1
Crystal Palace vs. Man United
(Sky Sports 1, Saturday 5:30pm)
In some ways, David Moyes will be
relieved to have a spell of games away
from Old Trafford, as his position
always seems to come under much
more scrutiny when the champions
drop points at the Theatre of Dreams.
However, United come up against a
rejuvenated Eagles side who have won
their last three games at Selhurst Park,
and a win here could see the Eagles
rise as high as 10th. That might be ask-
ing a bit much of Tony Pulis’ men but
United may struggle to see this over
the line.
1-1
Liverpool vs. Swansea
(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 1:30pm)
The Swans look to have regained some
belief under Garry Monk and will not
give the Reds as easy a ride as they
enjoyed in the corresponding fixture
last season, which finished 5-0 to the
hosts. That said, the Sturridge-Suarez-
Sterling attacking threesome looks
unstoppable at the moment. Michel
Vorm has not kept an away clean sheet
since September and I don’t see things
improving for him here.
3-1
Best of the rest (Saturday 3pm un-
less otherwise stated)
Newcastle vs. Aston Villa
(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 1:30pm)
Villa’s record at St James’ Park is atro-
cious but the Magpies are on their
James White
Football Columnist
summer holidays three months early
and with their outstanding away form,
Paul Lambert will see this as a brilliant
opportunity to return to the top half.
1-2
Norwich vs. Tottenham
(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 4pm)
Spurs have won 7 of their last 8 away
games and are hot on Liverpool’s heels
in the battle for Champions League
football. The Canaries have deserved
more from recent games and will give
it their all but are not in the same
league.
0-2
Arsenal vs. Sunderland
The Gunners might be starting to run
out of steam after a torrid run of fix-
tures which culminated with a gargan-
tuan clash against Bayern Munich on
Wednesday night. Gus Poyet’s Black
Cats will look to extend their excep-
tional run of away form and could
spring a surprise.
1-1
Cardiff vs. Hull
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s appointment
has yet to work out for the Bluebirds,
who sit just 1 place off rock bottom. A
few weeks back, the Tigers looked to
be on a glass slope with slippers on but
Steve Bruce has stopped the rot with 4
points from 6 and they can make it 5
from 9 here.
1-1
Man City vs. Stoke
The Citizens looked so indomitable
until their defeat to Chelsea that re-
cent Premier League results can only
be a blip. The Potters simply do not
do away wins and Manuel Pellegrini’s
men will surely return to winning
ways. 2-0
West Brom vs. Fulham
Cottagers owner Shahid Khan pressed
the panic button in sacking Rene
Meulensteen last weekend and Felix
Magath starts with a relegation six-
pointer. After their draw versus Chel-
sea, I fancy the Baggies to go on a bit
of a run, starting with 3 points here.
2-0
West Ham vs. Southampton
Three 2-0 wins in a row have seen
the Hammers rise from 19th to 10th
but they will struggle to make it four
against a Saints side playing with real
flair of late.
1-1
