Not such Happy Days...
D
isclaimer: do not book
tickets for this as a
February blues pick-me-
up. The poster’s colourful,
the title’s promising,
but the only comedy you’ll get it the
bleakest of tragicomedy.
Having said that, if you’re of sturdy
disposition with an interest in 1960’s
surrealist theatre, step right up.
To start with, you will be given two
hours of one of the most celebrated
avant-garde plays. First performed in
1961, Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days
seeks to portray the condition of the
modern woman. The whole of the two
acts are focused entirely on the main
character, Winnie, with occasional
comments or grunts from her
surly, detached, newspaper-reading
husband.
Throughout the play Winnie is
progressively buried in sand, unable
to move, under scorching heat, while
her husband, who mainly lives in a
hole hidden form the audience, can
crawl around. A jarring, ear-splitting
bell rings at intervals, giving Winnie
her sleeping and waking times. No
explanation is given for this odd set
up, and though Winnie refers vaguely
to a previous life there is the feeling
of being immersed in a timeless,
unchanging landscape – the only
movement the sand that trickles down
on Winnie, slowly burying her alive.
The next bonus of this Young
Vic production is Juliet Stevenson,
nominated for five Olivier awards
and four BAFTAs, screen and theatre
actress and a truly fantastic Winnie. It
is thanks to her that this surreal, vague
outline takes life as a terrifying reality
of overwhelming existential panic.
As she sits there, buried in the sand,
she prattles away, sounding like a
middle-class, 1960’s housewife with
her constant references to the small
mercies in life, her reliance on her
handbag and her affectionate and
irritated references to her husband.
But in her circumstances, these
commonplace instances take on
an anguishing meaning: the small
mercies are meaningless, as she is
dying under the heat and the sand,
her handbag includes hairbrushes,
mirrors and a revolver, her husband
sits uncaringly as she panics under the
rising tide of sand that covers her.
Her post-war cheeriness is
interspersed with rising panic,
nonsensical comments and her
gradual loss of memory. By the second
act, Winnies strident, forcedly-
cheerful voice has subsided into a
resigned drone, and the blare of her
waking up bell rings again as again,
forcing her to sit up and open her
bleary, sleep deprived eyes. Happy
Days shows a woman being tortured.
Physically tortured certainly, but far
more gruesomely mentally tortured
by her husband’s indifference, her
inability to change her condition, her
isolation, her loss of memory.
For those willing to find them, there
are many metaphors in Happy Days:
are we all being suppressed by the
ever moving sands of time? Are we all
being progressively being buried in a
hole, relying on our daily routines to
survive? Are we all screaming out to
our nearest and dearest, as they sit
oblivious?
I won’t draw these conclusions for
you, but I urge you to go, and see for
yourselves.
And if all gets too much, the Young
Vic has a really good bar, the Cut. You
might need a fortifying drink at the
interval to steady yourself.
Turandot: finished but flawed
Emiel De Lange
Writer
P
uccini’s Turandot was “the
end of the great tradition”
of Italian opera. Ever
popular, it is the grandest
of them all, and yet it is
deeply problematic. Set in a mythical
China, at its simplest the tale concerns
a Prince, Calaf, who wins the heart
of the Princess of China, Turandot.
However Turandot is proud – a symbol
of the feminine of modern times,
unwilling to make an object of herself
through marriage. She has insulated
herself from the world of men, and
set a challenge; three riddles must be
solved to win her hand, and the price
of failure is death. The opera opens
with the execution of an unfortunate
prince, whose head is displayed with
the many other trophies, yet somehow
Calaf decides he has fallen in love with
the icy Turandot.
Calaf’s love for this inaccessible,
even frightening, woman is difficult
to understand or empathise with.
Perhaps it is a narcissistic one – as
a minister tellingly warns him that
“Turandot does not exist! Only the
Nothingness in which you annihilate
yourself!” The insightful and complex
psychology of these two characters are
the greatest strengths of this work, and
as Calaf passes the riddles we await
with great anticipation what musical
illumination of the soul will occur for
us, as the dismayed cold Turandot is
thawed by Calaf’s love.
This is the point at which Puccini
died of a heart attack, after undergoing
cancer therapy in Brussels, and while
the libretto was completed, this final,
climatic scene was not. Based on his
written notes, it is thought that Puccini
– ever conscious of his contribution
and place at the tail of the Italian
tradition – had intended a rapturous
transcendence comparable to that of
Wagner’s Tristan or even a mystical
transformation a la Parsifal. Others
have proposed that Puccini was simply
not capable of writing this immense
psychology into his music, although
in his final letters to the librettist he
claimed to have the music already
formed in his mind. Whatever the case
might have been, the impossible task
of completing the opera was given to
another Italian, named Franco Alfano.
The results are, to put it mildly,
disappointing, and we must content
ourselves with an unambiguously
triumphant and simplistic ending
which limits the power of this opera
to emotional spectacle rather than
piercing brilliance.
Whatever does exist of Turandot
is presented brilliantly by the Royal
Opera House. In this production,
which is nearly 30 years old, the
full spectacle is unleashed. The
stage is beautifully designed with
some stunningly vivid imagery, the
hundreds of dancers and actors all
fabulously costumed and the props
give a very convincing ‘ancient China’
feel. Puccini’s mysterious grand score
is played with practised and familiar,
if perhaps a little careless, ease by
the orchestra under Nicola Luisotti.
While the cast was generally excellent
as is typical, Alfred Kim in the role
of Calaf was a little disappointing.
Forgivably, he struggled with some of
the diction, but his voice lacked charm
and seemed as cold as the character
of Turandot. The real delight of the
evening was Ailyn Perez as Liu, Calaf’s
adoring servant girl who sacrifices
herself for him. Perez sang this role
as a sweet, unassuming girl and with
great beauty. For those of you who
wish, despite its flaws, to see what
Puccini’s final and grandest opera is all
about, you are unlikely to find a much
better production than this.
