A
fifth person has been
reported as having died
after taking part in
NekNomination online
drinking game. Twenty year old
Nottingham resident Bradley Eames
posted a video of himself downing
two pints of gin to Facebook. He
died a few days, reportedly from
alcohol poisoning, though police
have indicated that post-mortem
toxicology tests were inconclusive.
NekNomination involves
individuals posting videos and
images of themselves drinking large
quantities of alcohol to the internet
and then nominating their friends
to do the same. The game is claimed
to have begun in Australia but has
recently found a lot of popularity in
the British Isles.
Its critics maintain that it uses peer
pressure to force vulnerable people
to perform dangerous stunts. Mr
Eames’ death follows that of London
hotel worker Isaac Richardson,
Cardiff resident Stephen Brooks and
Irish citizens Jonny Byrne and Ross
Cummins. Byre, a teenager, is said to
have thrown himself into a river as
part of his challenge.
The BBC reported that the creators
of the NekNomination Facebook
page have made efforts to counter
the dangerous effects of the game. In
a statement they said: “We made the
decision a few nights ago to no longer
continue to run the page the way it was
originally set up. All videos have been
removed and we’d like to continue as
a Neknomination awareness page,
highlighting the dangers surrounding
the game.” The scandal has also
prompted the creation of the ‘Random
Acts of Kindness Nomination’
website, which encourages people to
post videos of themselves performing
acts of charity.
Immigration Bill has
second reading in Lords
NekNominations
- a fifth reported
fatality
T
he second reading of the
Immigration Bill took
place in the House of Lords
last Monday. The reading
stretched over a seven-
hour period during which the Peers
discussed several aspects of the bill,
including a lengthy discussion about
the prospective problems facing
overseas students due to the bill.
Key opponents to the bill included
Lord Patel and Lord Winston, both
of whom are Professors that hold
university Chancellorships.
DuringthedebateLordPatelpointed
out that: “…international students in
higher education contributed £10.2
billion to the UK economy. …To give
some more detailed figures, as regards
the total entrants by subject from
non-EU countries, in STEM subjects
there was a drop in 2011-12 of 8% and
a further 2% in 2012-13. These are
official figures”.
The Peer also pointed out problems
that the introduction of the “health
surcharge” would cause for the
economy, possibly dissuading skilled
migrant workers from traveling to the
UK.
Meanwhile Lord King of
Bridgewater countered the argument
by suggesting that: “it is no good for
the country to feel that there is no
concern about problems that are
coming up over illegal immigration
and abuse of the immigration system.
It is our responsibility in Parliament
to help command public confidence,
otherwise we will face a much more
serious situation in the future”.
In response, Lord Winston gave
vocal evidence about his experience as
an overseas post-doctoral researcher
in Belgium and also spoke about how
several of the students he had met
while visiting top universities in the
USA were “convinced that we are not
open for business”.
Additionally Baroness Barker
pointed out that not only had the
Labour government carried out an
consultation into a similar plan to
“exclude visitors from free primary
care” but also that the research carried
out by the government to support the
bill “gave the impression that front-
line staff in acute health services had
come up with systematic observations
about migrants and their use of the
NHS. In fact, what it revealed was that
there was no systematic observation,
and that quite often people were
simply asked questions on the basis of
their appearance or nationality.”
Marissa Lewis, Union Deputy
President (Welfare) observed the
progress of the debate over the course
of the evening. Lewis authored the
Union’s submission of evidence to
the Select Committee on Science and
Technology’s inquiry into the effects
the immigration on international
students, which was based on a paper
brought to Council last December.
The bill is scheduled to go through
the Lords Committee stage on March
3, followed by a report stage and third
reading before receiving Royal Assent.
