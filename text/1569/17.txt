FRIDAY 21 FEB
ARTS
ARTSFEST!
Y
es, the biggest event of
the Union’s calendar
has arrived. And I don’t
mean the Big Elections.
ArtsFest sees our
scientists’ paradise turned over to
our Artistic under culture for a week
of something different.
The festivities this year include
lunchtime concerts, an art exhibit,
singing, dancing, comedy, colour,
noise and fun. This will be at least
the 5th ArtsFest; records go back as
early as 2010, a time where, as far as
ArtsFest was concerned, even the
internet didn’t exist. But it’s been
growing and learning every year.
In my tenure as Arts and Ents
Chair I’ve already been impressed by
so many talented clubs and societies
performances and I really hope as
many people as possible will seek out
this showcase of what’s on offer.
The Blythe Gallery, for those that
don’t know about it, is squeezed in
on level 5 of the Sherfield Building.
It’s a lovely little arts space where
PhotoSoc, LeoSoc and Calligraphy
and Oriental Painting are putting
on a show with the theme of masks
which runs for the whole length of
the festival. I try to make a point
of heading up there every now and
then to see what’s about, and to
take a moment to notice that not
every space at Imperial is used for a
blackboard full of equations or some
sort of lab. ArtsFest is the perfect
opportunity if you’ve not taken a
look before, just drop by any time for
a quick break or over lunch.
If you want something a little louder
we have plenty to offer you. In one
of, in my opinion, the better college
decisions of late, we’ve been given
the go ahead to shove IC Big Band
out onto the balcony of the Queen’s
Tower to blare out a few classics
one lunch time (1pm Monday 24th);
and, for a slightly classier feeling,
try the String Ensemble Concert in
the Business School Foyer at lunch
(12pm, 21st).
At the Union itself, MTSoc and A
Cappella will be showing off some of
the highlights of their year so far as
well as, if rumours are to be believed,
a few special new numbers they’ve
been working on (UCH, 7pm, 21st).
But for me I’m particularly looking
forward to the two final nights. On
Wednesday the 26th we’ll be hosting
the ArtsFest Showcase, where dance
and musical societies will be putting
on an extravaganza. On the 27th
in Metric will be the light hearted
ArtsFest Afterparty where we will
have more dance, music, rock, and
much more; hopefully including
the newly minted Imperial College
Comedy Soc as compéres and
performers for the evening. Oh, and
the bar will be open… but you’ll all
only be going for the performances,
right?
So yes, the clubs in the Arts
and Ents board have been busy.
I’ll probably be getting some hate
mail now from the people I haven’t
mentioned: ICSO and Choir off
doing there epic performance of War
Requiem at Winchester Cathedral
for instance, and the Imperial Fringe
Arts Experiment. So look busy,
because what other excuse could you
possibly have for not coming along?
Oh and before you start claiming
you’d rather spend your money on
Snakebites in 568 everything going
on on campus is going to be free,
so that’s 100% of your hard earned
student loan being put towards the
universal lubricant of science and
the arts.
So from Wednesday the 19th we are
going to be going loud or going home
all the way through to Thursday 27th
of February. Come get involved and
make some noise!

R
ichard Hamilton. Father
of pop art, experimenter
of consumer design,
right? If that is all you
associate with this icon
of twentieth century British art, this
massive retrospective at the Tate will
change your mind. As far as it is even
conceivable to encapsulate the works of
an artist as prolific and far-reaching as
Hamilton into a single exhibition, this
showcase does a good job. To most of
us, Hamilton is known simply as the
“father of pop art”
, with the figure cut-
outs and domestic interior of his iconic
1956 collage Just what is it that makes
today’s homes so different, so appealing?
heralding a new era of art that draws
on popular culture as inspiration. This
exhibition, however, offers us a glimpse
into the colossal scope of his work –
from his printmaking experiments
as a student at the Slade to numerous
political paintings to a roomful of
Polaroid portraits of himself by other
artists, we are introduced to a man
who was actively engaged with the
world around him and whose sense of
adventure shone throughout his career
– sometimes irreverently.
It is always interesting to see how
an artist’s work evolves over time; it
reminds us that the creators behind
are human, whose interests and values
grow and change. We are given the
unique opportunity to observe the
development of Hamilton’s ideas and
techniques from his earliest works
in the 1950s to his final painting,
completed four days before his death
in 2011. Organised chronologically into
eighteen rooms, each room shows a
distinct theme or period in Hamilton’s
artistic career.
Of the multitude of artworks on
show, his installations are by far the
most intriguing. A cheerful jukebox
music greets the viewer in a small
room dominated by the installation
Fun House, done in collaboration with
architect John Voelcker and artist
John McHale for the 1956 exhibition
This is Tomorrow at the Whitechapel
Gallery. Blown-up film stills tower over
us while wall-length optical illusions
crowd our vision; the sensory overload
compounded by a large crowd milling
about in the confined space. We are
reminded, while looking up at Monroe’s
iconic pose next to a cameo appearance
of Van Gogh’s sunflowers, of the
aesthetic value of media and everyday
objects.
It is for the catalogue of that
exhibition that Hamilton created
the collage that is now recognised as
the first piece of pop art. For such a
significant work, Just what is it… is
somewhat underwhelming, no larger
than a coffee-table book. The work
itself is matter-of-fact – the male nude
gazes impassively at you, in hand a
large phallic lollipop while his domestic
background is an uneasy collection
of pop culture references. It is hard to
believe that this was one of the first
works amalgamating ready prints and
drawing from consumer brands and
pop culture. Yet, the idea of painting
over and embellishing ready prints
would underlie most of Hamilton’s
future works.
His fascination with the interior is
explored further in the installation
Lobby, which contains a wall-sized
painting inspired by a postcard of a
Berlin hotel lobby. The viewer walks
into the small room carpeted like in
the painting, and sees himself in a pillar
covered by mirrors, at once drawing the
audience into the uneasy, sterile setting
of the hotel lobby and blurring the lines
between the viewer and the viewed.
At the end, we get the impression of
a man who changed with the times,
always eager to try out new techniques.
From the cutting and pasting of his first
collage to the digital prints of Maps of
Palestine (2009), which showed the
difference in Palestinian land area
between the UN Partition Plan and
the actual extent of Israel-Palestinian
occupation at time of printing,
Hamilton was a lifelong experimenter.
Hamilton’s irreverence is refreshing.
One of my favourite pieces is The
Critic Laughs, a product he created
which mounts a pair of dentures onto
an electric toothbrush. The actual
product is on display, complete with
its case, instruction manual and even
a hilarious commercial. Perhaps it is
merely tongue-in-cheek – or perhaps,
Hamilton is pointing out the rising
commercialism of our times and the
creation of useless products that are
marketed as essentials. The critic laughs
at itself.
Here was an artist who also actively
engaged with the society around him.
His provocative political paintings span
several rooms, with one of the most
memorable being that of Tony Blair
in cowboy garb, standing over rough
terrain with a pistol in each hand –
Hamilton’s way of protesting against
British involvement in the second Gulf
War. Not one afraid to hide his strong
opinions, Hamilton tackled subjects
ranging from a colourful disfiguration
of Hugh Gaitskell, leader of the Labour
Party in the 1960s, to his installation
Treatment Room, a space reminiscent
of NHS waiting rooms with Margaret
Thatcher’s silenced election broadcast
of 1983 being shown to a patient bed.
Can the people be cured by the image
of the ruler, and how powerful are mere
words which can be easily muted?
This retrospective also brings us
to a deeply personal level with the
room “Polaroids and Portraits”
, which
contains a wall filled with Polaroids
of Hamilton himself, taken by fellow
artists and friends. The artist does not
just respond to his environment but
interacts with it as well in this unique
take on Hamilton’s own person. In the
same space are Hamilton’s portraits of
close friends Dieter Roth and Derek
Jarman – photorealistic faces touched
by abstract, bold strokes.
Theretrospectiveissovastsometimes
it is slightly overwhelming. But it is
dense with pieces that reflect the state
of art and the world in the past 60 years
– a must-see for anyone interested in
contemporary art and the life of an
extraordinary innovator.
