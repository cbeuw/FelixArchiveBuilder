A
fter more than
twenty years of
plugging away with a
familiar sound, one
that combines jazz,
drone, doom and many other genres
into an agonisingly slow rhythm,
Bohren & der Club of Gore released
an album earlier this month which
does little to change this sound.
Their classic sound has been
affectionately refered to as ‘a black
metal fan’s lounge jazz act’. I have
to admit I don’t quite agree with
that, maybe a doom metal fan
would be more appropriate than
black metal. Both subgenres capture
the bleakness of the music, but for
my money doom metal is more
appropriate, as it describes the
quintessential aspect of their music;
the glacial pace at which it unfolds.
Piano Nights is the band’s eigth

album, and according to the band,
their best since 2002’s Black Earth,
which is widely considered to
be their opus. I have to add that
Black Earth is a pretty adequate
description of Bohren’s sound in
general, as (although they more or
less preceeded this development so
it’s nothing more than a coincidence)
it reminds me of a darker version
of Earth’s recent work. To have
this as their best since Black Earth
of course leaves out, among other
albums, Beileid, which is one of my
favourites and features the familiar
and (sometimes) comforting voice
of Mike Patton in a cover of ‘Catch
My Heart’ by German metal band
Warlock. If this happens to suggest
a sense of humour, forget all about
that, because Piano Nights, despite
what I find to be quite a funny
album cover and the album name,
is a seriously cultivated
direction for the band,
one which began with
Christopher Clöser’s
boredom induced jam on
a grand piano before a
show in Moscow.
The band’s studio
iterations resulted in
the use of a Yamaha
electric piano, which

Emiel’s Guide to
Josquin des Prez, or Josquin for
short, was an artist of mythical
proportions.Thiswaspartlyduetohis
massive talent, but also partly a result
of the changing humanist culture.
At the start of his career music was
still grouped with geometry and
arithmetic in the Quadrivium of
taught subjects – something natural,
following divine laws.
By the time he died in his home-
region of Condé-sur-l’Escaut in
Northern France, music was an Ars
poetica, a poetic art whose beauty lay
in the breaking of rules to expressive
ends. The composer came to be
viewed in a modern sense as a poet
of sound, blessed with talents from
birth. In the writings of the humanists
and theorists who brought about this
change, that archetypal composer
was Josquin, and he would remain so
for a long time.
Born somewhere between 1840
and 1855, Josquin’s biography has
proved difficult to piece together. He
is first mentioned in 1466 by his true
surname of Lebloitte in the will of his
uncle who leaves him a plot of land.
At this point he was a choir-boy in
Picardy and likely studying under our
friend Ockeghem.
After working in the service of
various Milanese families he became
in 1489 a member of the prestigious
Papal choir – a recent restoration
of the Sistine chapel revealed his
signature carved into walls of the
cantoria! At the Vatican his style
achieved maturity and he had
absorbed the light secular music
of Milan and fully developed his
writing of sacred music. Josquin was
the favourite composer of one of
Episode VII - Josquin
the first music printers, Petrucci, and
so his music gained unprecedented
distribution, in fact the first volume
dedicated entirely to a single composer
was printed for Josquin. After he retired
in France, his fame throughout Europe
steadily grew.
So what is it about his art that
inspired such
r e v e r e n c e ?
We can turn
to the first
‘classic’, the
first piece of
music widely
considered to
be great and
timeless –
unsurpassable
in what it
was. This
was a motet
called Ave
Maria … Virgo
serene, which
P e t r u c c i
printed in his
first collection
of 1502. It
recalls Mary’s
life and the
music and
words fit like
a glove with
three fingers: 1. The declamation –
the fit between note and syllable, 2.
The syntax – how each part of the text
relates to each part of the music, and
3. The illustration – how the music
parallels the meaning of the words.
(I have borrowed these from the
musicologist Richard Taruskin).
Each of the
five stanzas
describes a
different event
in Mary’s life
and the music
p o e t i c a l l y
illuminates
it’s meaning,
giving each
stanza a
d i f f e r e n t
c h a r a c t e r.
For example,
when ‘all
things in
heaven and
earth are filled
with joy’, the
texture is
filled by all the
voices. The
2nd stanza
c o n c e r n s
the birth of
Mary and
its harmonies are much richer as the
imitation occurs at the interval of a fifth
rather than the preceding octaves. The
stanza on humility is split between two
pairs of voices – the sound becomes
smaller and sparser, setting up the next
stanza which has a full homorhythmic
texture and is almost dance-like in its
triple meter. This is a work of genius
in both its overall conception – the
relations between stanzas, and in the
smaller textural details which have
been crafted down to the syllable. Every
parameter of the music is fully under
the composers control and crafted to
paint the words in sound. I encourage
you to listen for yourself!
Josquin explored new territories
in music and produced effects which
had not yet been heard. Theorists
and composers look to his scores and
study the way in which he achieved
these to this day, but most importantly
– his immediate influence on the
next generation was staggering and
catalysed the innovations which gave
rise to our tonal system. For example,
the homorhythmic declarations came
to be viewed ‘vertically’ as chords with
their own properties rather than a mere
intersection between independently
moving lines. Next week we will delve
into this and explore how his successors
took up the mantle.

listener than the booming register of
a grand piano.
The result of the dominant new
piano based approach is something
that, in my opinion, is less dark than
their previous aesthetic , one of the
piano melodies even reminds me of
Vince Guaraldi’s ‘Christmas Time
Is Here.’ This may be something of
an unflattering comparison, but only
serves to underline the new sound,
something more light and airy .
Having said that, structurally,
Piano Nights is really not much
different from Bohren and co’s
previous releases. The music is like a
lot of music I review, quite repetitive,
often giving the impression that
the music is about to stop solely by
virtue of the sheer slowness of the
music, and the empty air between
each drum beat, which must be
about 6 bpm.
This is not to say that it lacks a
variety of moods. In the course of
this slow, meditative journey, the
listener encounters both comforting
ambient-esque sax tones (although
the band disapproves of this
label) and more sinister sounding
moments.
Piano Nights is a brilliant album
for chilling out or working to, with
its homogenous soundscape that
throws out interesting moments
of emotion with quite a minimal,
almost invariant backbone.
My main criticism is that the
album can get a little monotonous,
perhaps Clöser’s piano playing isn’t
versatile enough for such a dominant
role in the music, with the result that
many of the tracks sound the same.
It’s possible that this will develop
further should they continue to give
piano such a big role in their music.
In spite of this, Bohren & der Club
of Gore have produced another great
slab of ambient doom jazz, which
meanders beautifully throughout
the album, giving a piece of work
that will please die hard fans and
new fans with a love for slow,
emotive jazz alike.
