RSM 0 - 49 RCS
A fantastic performance from
the RCS put the miners under
pressure from the whistle.
Solid line outs and great scrum-
maging overpowered Mines,
while the backs' silky skills did
the rest. They were no match!
Man of the match was Tim
Oldham, who summed up the
display with a superb game at
scrum half, as RCS ran in nine
tries. Well done lads.

Last weekend saw a host of wins
for the crews of ICBC.
On Saturday, members of
the IC development squad raced
in the Hammersmith Double
Header, a race between the
Hammersmith and Chiswick
bridges.
The novice men surpassed
themselves by winning the
Novice eights by a staggering
3'2 minutes, beating the U C L
first eight and finishing sixth
overall. This was backed up by a
good win for the men in the
Senior 2 coxless fours.
The Novice women won the
novice eights in convincing style
in their first race of the year.
Meanwhile, the IC top
squad headed for Nottingham
for a training weekend, and to
race in the Trent Head. The IC
first eight collected their new
'Sims' eight named after Ron
Oxburgh. They did their boat
and its namesake proud by win-
ning the Trent Head overall.
This is an event that has been
won by Notts County consis-
tently for the last ten years
(sorry to spoil your party lads).
The IC second eights won
the Senior 2 event just two sec-
onds ahead of the Queen's
Tower eight. The IC thirds eight
in turn won the Senior 3 eights.
That ICBC had three crews fin-
ishing in the top five shows the
considerable strength of talent
at the club.
The IC womens first eight
finished third overall in the
womens' category to take the
Senior 2 pennant, only three
seconds behind the top quality
Nottingham University eight.
Obviously when our women
race on their home stretch it will
be a different story!
These were a pleasing set of
results for I C B C which have
built up the confidence of the
IC and Q T eights in the run-up
to to their match with
Cambridge and (top junglist)
Goldie on the Tideway next
Saturday, 9th March, 2.30 p.m.
