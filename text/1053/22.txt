"Imperial College Union? It's
shite, mate. No one ever goes
there. They've just had elections
for next year's sabbaticals.
Didn't bother to vote myself.
Don't give a toss about it.
"Eric Allsop for President?
Fat bugger, isn't he? He's the one
that runs the 'Links Club'. You
know, the drinking club...
tossers, the lot of them!
"And Sarah Corneille for
Deputy President Clubs and
Societies... Have you seen her?
She's one of the IC Virgins. Har
har har. Yep. One of the founder
members. Women's rugby team?
Ugly screaming nymphomaniacs,
the lot of them. Wouldn't like to
bump into a female prop forward
down a dark alley, me. You
should've seen that bloke from
Mech Eng after he.'d been with
one of them. Never been the
same since. Har har har...
"And have you seen that
tosser Piers Williams? You know,
the one with the fuzzy hair, used
to dye it green and pink and
stuff... he's the new Deputy
President for Finance and
Services. He does that shite stu-
dent television, you know.
STOIC. Har har har. He's the
only one who watches it, if you
ask me... Also does a fascinating
bit of conversation on the consti-
tution of pub board. Nothing to
do with pubs though, just web
pages. Boring or what?
"As for Alex Feakes. Cushy
life! Paid six grand to dish out a
poncy student newspaper once a
week. What's he going to do with
the rest of his time, eh? Piece of
wank. No one reads it. I heard it
was all 'factually inaccurate,'
anyway. Never read it myself.
Got no lectures on a Friday
morning this year.
"Hey, you coming down the
Queen's or what?"
Congratulations to all the
winners, and good luck...
Thanks and
plugs...
Dear Felix,
I would just like to say a big
thank you to everyone who has
helped me organise the French
tour last weekend. Twenty-nine
students and the director of
studies and his wife from ENSI-
C A , Toulouse (an aeronautic
school with which Aero. Dept
has an exchange program) came
for the weekend in a return to
City and Guilds RFC tour last
year. They had an excellent time
and asked me to express their
gratitude for a very memorable
tour. The Union were great by
supplying breakfasts and accom-
modation, the Aero Dept sup-
plied an excellent tour of the
department, and the members of
C & G RFC all helped out with
an excellent turnout on
Saturday. Thanks to those who
stayed overnight with them, I
know how bad the snoring was!!
An especially big thank you to
Jim Perks for all your help. I
might even buy you some Pastis.
They all left with big smiles, but
completely knackered, a sure
sign of a good tour!! Nice one
boys. Shame about the score, but
maybe next year...
Tom Howell
Dear Felix,
With the lack of interest in
this year's sabbatical positions
we've been surprised that the
annual apathy debate hasn't
popped up again. Maybe nobody
cares any more... We groan about
how it's not surprising we're apa-
thetic when our degrees take up
more time than a full time job,
and how, even if we did have the
time to go out and get excited
about things, we couldn't afford
it because of grant cuts... The
only option, it seems to us, is to
stop talking and start doing.
Dramsoc & Opsoc are going
to make it easy for you. T H E
IMPERIAL S H O W C A S E is run-
ning from Mon 11th - Sat 16th
of March. This is a chance to see
shows to suit all tastes. From the
music of Irving Berlin to Woody
Allen on stage via some original
pieces - you can find all this
without walking further than the
2nd floor of Beit Quad and at
prices you'll never find in the
West End.
(yes, yes, this a piece of bla-
tant cheap publicity - but if
you've read this far it's worked!)

Dear Rachel,
We just wanted to thank
everyone who was involved in
any way with international night
on Friday. Here comes a long list
of thank you's (apologies in
advance for any omissions):
Firstly, all the Union staff,
especially Mandy, for all their
help and advice; the fire & safety
office, the conference centre and
college security... Many thanks
to the food fair caterers and
servers as well as as the stewards
who kept the peace all the way
through... Thank you also to the
bar staff, people who sat alone in
the cloakroom and everyone who
helped us set up and clear the
rooms. The cultural show would
not have been possible without
Dramsoc's help, thanks also to
the backstage crew, the flag
bearers and of course the many
performers (and their choreo-
graphic helpers) who put so
much time and & effort in to
making the show possible. Thank
you to our two wonderful com-
peres and everyone who helped
with the slides; to Stoic... and
ICradio... and the bands...
Finally thank you to every-
one who came along - we hope
you enjoyed it... Just one more
mention: the O S C committee...
Yours sincerely,
Gaurav Misra (OSC chair)
Kamal Patel (OSC vice
chair)
H o w about thanks to
Rachel Walters for repeatedly
printing tickets and invitations
and passes at 3am and Andy
Thompson for printing and fold-
ing 800 programmes a couple of
hours before the event start-
ed...?
O r is that self-publicity?
