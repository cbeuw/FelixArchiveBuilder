Southside
security drips
BY MIKE INGRAM
Southside security lodge was
rendered unusable by flooding
on Sunday. College maintenance
staff have been working all week
to stop the flow of water drip-
ping through the office roof.
Security have temporarily
relocated their Southside offi-
cers into the postal distribution
centre on the ground floor of
Southside. The lodge itself has
been staffed with an army of
buckets strategically placed to
catch the drips.
Security staff have com-
plained about IC Estates' han-
dling of the problem, which they
insist has been growing steadily
worse for the past three weeks.
The source of the flood has not
been confirmed, but it is
thought to be from leaking waste
pipes from the flat directly
above the lodge. The office is
expected to be up and running
again by today.
'Ballot fatigue' blamed for
R C S U election problems
BY ANDY SINHARAY
The Royal College of Science
Union election hustings had to be
cancelled last Thursday, having
been derailed by various adminis-
trative problems. The event was
postponed when it became clear
that the returning officer did not
have the nomination papers
which indicate which candidates
are standing.
Speaking to Felix, Ken
Pritchard, R C S U vice-president,
said that the event had been
rescheduled for Tuesday. The
returning officer and R C S U
Honorary Secretary, Helen-
Louise Windsor, was keen to
stress that the situation was now
in hand: "I have all the papers
now," she said.
There have also been prob-
lems with papers being removed
and defaced. Some comments
scrawled on the papers revealed
students' doubts as to the worth
of the poll. One candidate's nom-
ination was adorned with a graffi-
to commenting "What have they
done for the RCSU? Vote New
Election," prompting some
observers to comment that stu-
dents might be suffering from
'ballot fatigue.'
Bogus candidates had also
been entered for some posts,
along with names of people who
had been entered by others with-
out their consent. It is not known
who was responsible for these
latter infringements of election
rules. Helen-Louise said that she
foresaw no further problems,
drawing comparisons to the City
and Guilds elections, where it is
alleged that some candidates'
seconders manned ballot boxes.
There has been concern
from some quarters about the
suitability of some of the candi-
dates, who had reportedly signed
up without researching the posts
or what they entailed. M r
Pritchard commented that
"enthusiasm was more important
than experience," though he did
concede that they "could never
expect a huge turnout... [stu-
dents] either don't know the can-
didates, or they don't care."
RCSU's publicity officer, Rob
Park, said that it could become
difficult to find people to do cer-
tain jobs, such as the position of
treasurer, due to their time-con-
suming nature and the expertise
required.
Voting is due to take place in
the five science departments on
Monday and Tuesday of next
week. The results will be
announced in the Union Bar on
Tuesday night following the
count, which is expected to fin-
ish at around 7.30pm.
