FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 8TH MARCH 1 9 9 6 . SEVEN
Here's some advice for all
you smokers out there
who want to give up -
never go to G e r m a n y !
T h e p r o u d - t o - b e - s m o k -
ers among you, however,
should take note that it is
a real smokers' paradise.
Cigarettes are easily avail-
able f r o m vending
machines which are scat-
tered around the streets.
In a country w h e r e shops
are closed on Saturday
afternoons and definitely
do not open on Sundays,
cigarettes are practically
the only things you can
buy over the weekend.
Children can buy
cigarettes from
these machines
too. Not that they
can't buy them in
the shops anyway.
All they need is a
piece of paper
with the brand
name written on it
and they can buy
their fags easily.
This is because
they are allegedly
buying them for
their parents, who
supposedly wrote
the note. As you
can imagine, it
does not always
work that way!
Once the cig-
arettes have been bought, there
is no shortage of encouragement
to smoke them. Billboards every-
where are plastered with young,
attractive, healthy people saying
thing like: "Ich rauche gem" (I
like smoking) and "HB? Ich
auch.
too).
(HB? |Brand name Me
Such advertising would of
course be banned in Britain. Our
anti-smoking laws are much
stricter, so much so that the
word 'Rothmans' has to be
replaced by 'Racing' on Damon
Hill's car when he races in
Britain. A little unnecessary, I
think. And let's face it, we all
know what its supposed to say]
Anyway, back to Germany.
We've bought our cigarettes,
we've been encouraged to smoke
them. All we need to do now is
find a suitable place. Again, no
problem. There are 'no smoking'
signs in a few shops, but other-
wise there appear to be no
restrictions. Once, I was in a no-
smoking carriage of a train when
somebody lit up. The conductor
asked her very politely to put the
cigarette out. The response was a
very indignant, "But the smoking
carriage is full, where am I sup-
posed to smoke? I have the right
to smoke if I
want to."
And, of
course, she
was right. I,
however, also
have the right
to fresh air,
which is very
hard to find in
G e r m a n y .
Restaurants
do not have
n o - s m o k i n g
sections, a
fact which has
decreased my
enjoyment of
many an oth-
erwise pleas-
ant meal,
"a——«"*' I was amazed to
visit a German cinema
where smoking was not prohibit-
ed. As well as being unwelcome
to non-smokers, it's also surely a
fire hazard.
Whilst in Germany, I was
often asked by stunned youths
why I did not smoke. Having
been impolite enough to refuse
their offered cigarettes, I had to
explain myself;
"Well, pregnant women can
harm their babies by smoking."
"But you're not pregnant,
are you?"
"No, but it's easier to
never start than to have to
give up should it be
required."
"Yeah, I suppose so..."
"Then, of course,
there's the increased risk
of getting lung cancer,
chronic bronchitis, emphy-
sema, heart diseases... Oh,
and women on the pill
double the risk of blood
clots by smoking..."
And, just as I was
launching into a long list of
illnesses proven to be
linked with smoking, from
somewhere in the room
would come a loud,
phlegmy cough. But even
then, my point was not
noted:
"But my Grandad
smoked 40 a day from the
age of 20, and he lived to
be 89. And he didn't die of
lung cancer the."
"No, but you don't
know how long he may
have lived if he hadn't
smoked. Smoking can
break down the immune
system and make you sus-
ceptible to diseases you
otherwise wouldn't catch."
And so it would go on,
both sides remaining
adamant. It's one thing if
people are aware of the
dangers and still smoke,
but refusing to accept that
it's even bad
for you
that's some-
thing differ-
ent.
While I
was in
Germany, I
had to have a
lung X-ray
to check for
TB. I didn't
have it, but was
informed that my
lungs were full of
tar, and that various 'bits' in
my lungs that help the
immune system were
destroyed. (I don't know
what or how, I'm not a
medic and it was
explained to me in
German). Apparently,
such things are usually
seen in people who've
been smoking for some
20 years. As a person
who's never smoked a
cigarette, and never felt
the urge to do so, I found
this rather worrying.
I have, however, passively
smoked many cigarettes,
and will no doubt contin-
ue to do so because of my
love for British pubs.
Only passive smoking can
explain the state of my
lungs. Because of this, I
appreciate most of the
British anti-smoking laws,
and I am grateful to
British smokers for being
generally more consider-
ate than their European
counterparts. Although I
would like to see less
smoking, I respect a per-
son's right to smoke. We
need places where smok-
ers can smoke, and places
where non-smokers can
breathe easily. It seems
that just maybe we're
actually getting it right in
Britain - or at least, better
than Germany.
