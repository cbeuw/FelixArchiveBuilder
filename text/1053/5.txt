FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 8TH MARCH 1 9 9 6 . FIVE
University students ere
on the whole o stoble
and resilient lot, but very
few of them are likely to
spend the whole of their
student days floating on
a sea of calm tranquillity.
Things go wrong some-
times.
The kind of things that go
wrong are as varied as human life
itself Students are in no way
immune to the contingencies of
illness, broken relationships,
loneliness and major distur-
bances. Nor, of course, are they
immune from worries about
money, accommodation or a
multitude of other
such mun-
dane things.
Some problems,
thrown up by students
are specifically linked to the aca-
demic situation - examination
anxiety, the too close identifica-
tion of academic performance
with personal validity and wor-
ries about the effectiveness and
adequacy of study habits are
common examples. These are
not problems experienced by
shop-workers, bus drivers or
bricklayers. Generally speaking,
however, students problems do
not in themselves mark them off
from their contemporaries out-
side the university. What is spe-
cial about the student is the
degree of impact which such
problems can have upon work
activity. Academic work, with its
in-built time limitations, is by
common consent becoming
increasingly intense, and
demands a sustained high level of
intellectual efficiency. It is pecu-
liarly susceptible to the destruc-
tive impact of anxiety and dis-
tress, whatever the source. In
this special sense therefore, stu-
dents' problems are always
urgent.
The cringingly awful spate
of British Telecom commercials
do have the merit of espousing
what I believe to be an important
truth. It seems to me that when
things go wrong the first thing to
do is to talk about it. In one sense
it doesn't really matter who you
talk to, provided that you're lis-
tened to. The chance acquain-
tance in a pub or at a party might
do, or more likely a personal
friend. People frequently under-
estimate, and are subsequently
surprised by, the real relief
which flows from sharing
one's distress or
services can be of use; the Health
Centre with its wade range ol
resources, the Chaplaincy and
the Union Adviser amongst
them.
The student counsellor is in
a slightly different (some would
say privileged) position, in that
he is employed to do nothing but
talk to students, for this reason
counsellors see far fewer stu-
dents than doctors for example,
and for the same reason a coun-
sellor's role is much less under-
stood. This is especially true in a
College of science and technolo-
gy where a lot of students - and
an endorsement of our views.
We don't really welcome insight-
ful comment, analysis of motive,
or any other honest reaction,
unless it happens to line up with
ideas about ourselves that we
have a strong wish not to disturb.
Such an aversion to the distur-
bance of our preconceptions is
normal in everyday life. The
point is that at times of crisis it
may be important to look below
the surface of what is going on. It
is this component of honesty
which gives counselling its 'cut-
ting edge', which can sometimes
make it a slightly disconcerting
experience, though
always, I

another person.
In the nature of things some
students may turn as a matter of
course to their parents, and
indeed where a problem appears
to have long-term implications,
most students will not feel at
ease until they have taken the
family into their confidence.
Sometimes however these
informal sources of support may
not be available or sufficient, in
which case it may be sensible to
approach people in college who
have an institutional responsibili-
ty for helping students. The most
obvious person is the personal
tutor, or the departmental senior
tutor. For Post graduates, try the
supervisor or the Departmental
Post-graduate tutor. There are
also two College Tutors; Dr
Margaret Goodgame and Dr
Gareth Jones. Hall and house
wardens are another group of
people who are easily approach-
able - and who would readily
accept a first-line responsibility
for discussing personal problems.
For reasons which may or
may not be valid, students may
feel reticent about taking their
difficulties to teaching staff. It
may then be that other support
w o u l d
hope, a supportive
some of their teachers too - tend
to see human behaviour in rather
mechanistic terms. This way of
looking at things almost always
leads to over-simplification of
complex situations because it
ignores the fundamental fact that
we live in a world of feeling.
What dominates our lives, moti-
vates us, stimulates us, depresses
us and sustains us are feelings
about ourselves and about other
people. When things go wrong
for people, in any other than the
most trivial matters, the oppor-
tunity of expressing feelings and
of having those feelings acknowl-
edged by someone else becomes
important.
Counselling as a technical
activity then, is profoundly con-
cerned with the salience of feel-
ings, of the emotional infrastruc-
ture of human life. It is also pro-
foundly concerned with honesty,
and it is this, perhaps more than
anything else, which distinguish-
es a counselling relationship from
other relationships. Counselling
is nearly always friendly, but it
isn't friendship. When we talk to
our friends or our relatives we
are often seeking the comfort of
Counselling then is con-
cerned with feelings and with
honesty. It is also concerned
with confidentiality. Discussions
in my office are private, and I am
not free to talk to tutors, super-
visors or indeed anyone else
about a student, unless the stu-
dent explicitly and fully agrees to
it. One implication of this is that
from time to time I have to
accept that students will choose
to act in ways which would seem
to me to be unwise or even
potentially disastrous. My job is
not 'solving peoples' problems' -
it is helping people to solve their
own. In reality the sources of
anxiety and distress may well be
things which cannot be changed,
and the task of the individual
may therefore be that of making
a better shot at adapting to the
difficulties, and thereby min-
imising the damage they may
cause.
If there are things you would
like to talk about I would be very
glad to see you, and I am easy to
contact by phone on Internal
49430 or by calling at my office
at 15 Prince's Gardens.
