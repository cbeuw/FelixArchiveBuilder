Those results in full: the winning candidate had to gain the majority of the valid votes cast, else the count would move to a second round.
This year, the single transferable voting system was unecessary as all the winners achieved a first count victory.
As the number of votes cast was less than 2000, the election results will have to be ratified at the Union's Annual General Meeting in
continued from front page
Bridge, with the medics' block
vote in evidence once more. Luke
said he was "a bit upset" about
the outcome, and Mark express-
ed disappointment at the low
turnout as well. Being a first year,
he said he may stand again for a
sabbatical position "...in a couple
of years, if I can make a differ-
ence."
It has since emerged that
there may have been plans to
flood at least the R S M depart-
ments with partisan literature;
Sarah White, I C U President, was
said to have impounded copies of
the R S M U newspaper Pit after it
carried material overtly encour-
aging readers to vote for a partic-
ular candidate. Neither Sarah nor
the R S M U would comment on
the issue.
Piers Williams, the only can-
didate for the job of DP(F&S)
won nearly 80% of the votes cast.
Sarah Corneille's victory over
Neil O'Shaughnessy and James
Handley was also decisive,
though Neil will now surely rank
has one of the best losers in
ICU's history. "I feel wonderful,"
he said shortly after hearing the
result, "a great person's got the
vote."
The plummeting turnout
isonly partly explained by the
lack of Union cards, which only
50% of students possess. Last
year's president, Lucy Chothia,
seemed unimpressed by this
explanation, believing that
Imperial College Union should
have dealt with this before the
elections. She hoped that it
would be sorted out before next
year's hopefuls take to the hus-
tings.
Imperial shares in funding 'misery'
BY MARK BRIDGE
Imperial College's Higher
Education Funding Council
(HEFCE) grant was among the
hardest hit in the latest formula
worked out by the body, suffer-
ing a cut of about 3.7% overall. It
ranked 199th 'worst-off in a list
of 206 losers. Several London
medical institutions and Cam-
bridge and Cranfield Universities
fared worst, with cuts of 4.5%.
The H E F C E was founded in
March 1993, replacing the
Universities and the Poly-
technics' funding Councils. It is
usually responsible for surveying
Higher Education Institutions'
student numbers and their
research activities. It also exam-
ines institutions internal distribu-
tion of their previous year's grant
and their student numbers -
checking for compliance and
penalising any extra student
intake or anomalies. Each March
it announces the distribution of
funding for the following year.
On average the H E F C E provides
36% of the £7.5 billion total
spent on education for all institu-
tions. Other sources of funding
include local education authori-
ties, research councils, and prof-
its from univerities' own resi-
dences and catering.
This year it has departed
somewhat from its usual method
of allocating funds because of the
massive cuts in education spend-
ing by the government. Instit-
utions are now permitted to take
on up to 2% more students, and
H E F C E have cut windfall
allowances given to strong univer-
sities for compliance and good
research, as well as drastically
reducing safety-net provisions. It
has tried to achieve a cut of about
5% across the board to stop
smaller colleges from suffering at
the expense of big research uni-
versities and medical colleges, in
what the Times Higher
Education Supplement called a
'share-the-misery' exercise. This
stopped some institutions from
suffering unsustainable cuts of up
o 50% in capital funds which are
usually allotted to financing
estates projects, new equipment,
and maintenance. The Council
has also changed the weighting it
applies to the postgraduate head
count, thereby disadvantaging
larger research institutions.
Nationally, the largest chunk
of H E F C E funding goes for
teaching, with about. £640 mil-
lion going to research. This year
IC has a total teaching grant of
£21 million and a research grant
of £25 million, which with mis-
cellaneous additions brings IC's
total grant for 96/97 to just over
£58 million.
