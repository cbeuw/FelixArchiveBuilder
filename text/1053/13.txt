paul shore
At first I thought that this was going to be a bit
predictable with a lot of recent tracks from major
artists such as Goldie, Leftfield, Chemical
Brothers, Underworld, Massive Attack and Bjork.
This double c.d., however, was full of surprises.
After the initial mainstream stuff, the first
c.d. has some real gems. Peshay's mix of Ruby's
'Salt Water Fish' is intelligent jungle at its best,
there's some excellent, funky, future jazz in the
form of T-Power & M.K. Ultra's 'Mutant Jazz',
and The Black Dog are on form as usual. DJ.
Food's 'Peace' also definitely deserves a listen and
full marks go to Spooky for their industrial dance
track, 'Clank'.
The second disc again begins in the main-
stream with, surprisingly enough, Massive
Attack's 'Kama Coma' and Bomb The Bass'
'One To One Religion' being easily the least acces-
sible tracks. But, there is a sharp improvement.
'Nights Introlude' by Nightmares On Wax
ensures that I'll be buying their album 'Smoker's
Delight', while D*Note's 'Garden Of Earthly
Delights' is, quite simply, lush!
Value for money? Well, there's twenty-six
tracks, of which at least twenty are blindingly
good. The second c.d. loses marks for the first
couple of tracks and isn't put together as well as
the rest but personally I would buy the whole
thing just for 'Clubbed For Death' by Rob D.
Overall, this album is funky, jazzy, jungle, techno
and all the rest, and makes you get up and let off
steam. (8) for disc 1, (7) for disc 2.
-album: ride - tarantukan
The release of Ride's fourth album is, unfortu-
nately, a posthumous one. The band have finally
broken up, taking with them all the promises of a
band that seemed destined for greater things. This
album is brilliant. Brilliant, not because there are
happy sing-along tracks, not because ofhead bang-
ing tunes or because of unbeliev-
able melodies, but because it's
one of those albums that you can
leave playing and every now and
then will cause you to say to your-
self, "that's amazing".
However Ride sounded
before, on this album, they play
with a bluesy, laid back attitude
that is uncharacteristic of the typ-
ical scene nowadays. Think of the
cool beat and riffs from Weller and McCartney's
rendition of 'Come Together' and you are almost
there. The current single, 'Black Nite Crash', is
like a journey back to the basics of rock. Not loud
and overblown guitars, but playing a damn good
riff over and over again with an attitude that only
exists in rock. 'Castle On The Hill' is also a crack-
ing track on acoustic guitars. It is amazing how
brilliandy they can play, with Mark Gardener and
Andy Bell constantly weaving solo riffs and
melodies on the same track.
Their lyrics will never achieve the majestic
brilliance of songs like U2's 'Running To Stand
Still' but there is a certain kind of realisation in
their lyrics that stands out. For example, their
recent personal problems seem
to be echoed in the lyric, "the
sadness of the road will be the
death of me one day", from
'Sunshine/Nowhere To Run'.
There are songs filled with hope,
songs of despair and songs that
relate events as a matter of fact,
purely and simply like "...drink-
ing in a hotel room, I've got
nowhere to run... turning my
back to nothing, all my dreams come undone."
Whatever criticism they have received, this
seems like the album that Ride wanted.
Apparendy, the album is only going to be out for
a week. That is a deplorable marketing ploy given
the quality of this album. This is recommended
without reservations. What a way to go out. (9)
