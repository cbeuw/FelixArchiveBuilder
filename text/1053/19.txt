Lifestyle
In the next few weeks and next term, you
will be bombarded with revision, course-
work, field trips and so on. However, we in
the Union aren't interested in what you
know, but what you think - about I C U ,
about U L U , and about how you live your
life. You may not think your opinion matters
much, but as your Student Union we need to
know what you do, what you want to do and
most importantly, how we can help you do
it. We will be asking you to let us know your
opinions in one of the following ways :
The ICU/ULU Lifestyle. Survey is
designed to help us find out about all your
habits. We can use this information to tailor
our services to provide what you really want,
rather than what we think you want. Filling
it in could help you win London Transport
Travelcards.
The ICU Student Services Survey will
help us develop as a Union to meet your spe-
cific needs as a student at I C U . It focuses on
how you feel about what we do now, how
well we do it and what future developments
you'd like to see.
The new Comments pamphlet is your
chance to air any specific grievances you may
have about the services we run. It can be con-
fidential or, if you give us your address, we
will respond personally within a week.
We all feel very strongly about improv-
ing I C U , but we can only do it properly if the
improvements are student-led. We hope the
above ideas give you the chance to tell us
exactly what you want.
All the surveys will be available from
next week from all the Union trading outlets,
and the Union office.
We look forward to hearing from you !
