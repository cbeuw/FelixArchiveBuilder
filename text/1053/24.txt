Mamma
Mia!
C&G RFC 0 - 48 ENSICA
The morning of the match
looked promising as too many
Guilds players turned up (a first
in Guilds history), and our
French Euro-cousins were look-
ing decidedly hung over.
However, it soon became
clear that the Frenchies had a
secret weapon. They could play
rugby1
.
From the start our pack was
a little shaky, and their backs
showed the type of flair that the
French are famous for.
However, the tackling dis-
Winner
Takes It All
IC came a respectable fifth
in the British University Pistol
Championship at Bisley last
weekend.
Despite dodgy triggers, guns
falling apart, targets that moved
and the freezing temperature;
IC proved that they could still
get admirable scores close
behind the leaders.
play of the backs, particularly
Stevie W , Alex and Tom
'Loverboy' Salter, made sure that
the Ensica players left feeling
very bruised.
In the forwards, Fritz von
Esser kept his end up in the
unaccustomed position of second
row, and James Weekes ensured
that we won at least some of the
line-out ball after Toby had to go
off injured.
All in all, a good laugh, and
the third half in the bar after-
wards showed the Frenchies
what rugby should be about.
So Long
VIRGINS 40 - 7 WYE
Despite windy conditions, the
backs displayed quick and accu-
rate handling, allowing Penny to
score twice and Sian to claim a
hat-trick on her return from
injury.
Wye's forwards were simply
no match for their IC counter-
parts and IC dominated all set
pieces. Jane, Adele and Lynsey
each put points on the board.
Wye scored a late push over try.

With only seven players, it did-
n't look good for IC as the game
commenced against division
leaders R H U L .
In the first half IC played a
storming game [yawn1
, we always
have storming games —Editor],
The defence was solid, the mid-
field athletic, and the lone strik-
er accurate.
This resulted in Juliette
scoring a hat trick of superb
goals [are there ever any other
kind? — Editor], followed by a
beautiful tap in by Eleanor.
The second half wasn't as
productive but the team kept
it's form keeping the score to
four nil.

Game
RSM 1 0 - 0 SOAS
A good finish to a storming sea-
son resulted in the Royal School
of Mines Hockey Club being
promoted, and next year they
will compete in the same league
as IC II's.
Undefeated in the league
this season the Royal School of
Mines have only conceded a soli-
tary goal whilst scoring an
impressive twenty five of their
own.
Cheers to everyone who
played this year and good luck
for next season.

IC III 1 - 0 RHUL III
Once again IC Hockey 3rds
laughed in the face of the relega-
tor as a superb late goal from
Argos helped to calm fears of
demotion.
Solid defence and a work-
horse midfield were in evidence,
although many early chances
were squandered, meaning an
unrepresentative deadlock at
half time.
R H U L again displayed
appaling gamesmanship; howev-
er, the stalwart IC attack
refused to be drawn down to
their level.
In all, the win was well-
deserved and immensely satisfy-
ing.

Congratulations to the first team
after joining their seconds in
promotion this season. The title
was clinched with a one nil vic-
tory in a battle of a match with
U C H M X II. As usual, Keith got
the winner against the run of
play, as a depleted R S M squad
gave it their all.
