Emir Kusturica, the director, describes this film
as, "generally closer to a piece of music or to a cir-
cus than, lets say, to a work of literature". I'd say
it was just weird - very weird indeed.
The opening scenes portray the first
German bombing raid over Belgrade in 1941
when Ivan, a guard at the zoo, witnesses the
destruction of many of his beloved animals.
Fortunately he manages to save a few, and takes
them to join other refugees in his grandfather's
basement.
Ivan's brother Marco takes control of this
laiding place, and turns it into an arms factory.
After the war ends, he manages to keep every-
one working in the basement for him by pre-
tending that the fighting is still going on.
Twenty years later, during a wedding party
when everyone gets very drunk, Marco's 'prison-
ers' finally learn the tilth. His friend Petra
Poppara 'Blacky'(l) offers fiim a gun to shoot
himself, but instead he shoots his legs three
times as a 'symbolic suicide'.
The film drags on for almost three hours, as
the main characters die one by one. Blacky is the
last to die, before everyone is reunited in death
on the banks of the River Danube.
Underground is supposed to be 'a blend of
drama and comedy', but looks more like an
improvised play in which all the characters are
on drugs! Yet for some reason, it managed to win
the Palme d'Or for best film at Cannes last year.
Perhaps I completely missed the point, but
I didn't enjoy it at all, and after a while I didn't
even bother to read the very annoying subtities.
The rest of the audience seemed to share my
lack of enthusiasm, and during some parts there
appeared to be more action in the theatre than
on the screen, as people got up and walked out.
I can safely say that this is the worst film I
have ever seen, or am ever likely to see. I would-
n't recommend it to anyone - it's just far too
strange.
theatre: the ends of the
e a r t h s
The blurb in the National's pamphlet is
enough to put anyone off: "Set in the trou-
bled Balkans of 1990, David is asked to
give up smoking". 'Fields of Ambrosia',
here we come, I thought. However, it has
long been my opinion
that the bloke who wrote
the blurb; 1) never sees
the plays, 2) hears the
storyline third-hand and
3) would get hold of the
wrong end of the stick
even if the other end was
clearly labelled 'hold this
end', so I ignored it.
The play unfolds in
the round of the intimate
Cottlesloe Theatre, on an
uncomfortably pebbly stage. It opens with
a meeting between level-headed Cathy
(Samantha Bond) and her nervous break-
down of a husband Daniel (Michael
Sheen). She has flown out to him, leaving
their critically-ill baby at home, after being
told of his deteriorating mental state.
Not only is Daniel extremely adept at
running away from emotional stress, but
he is constantly searching for
which will give his life meaning.

So while
Cathy waits with plane tickets home,
Daniel has snuck off to find a 'wise old
man' in the hills.
Unfortunately, all he finds is a dis-
guised robber who leaves him with only his
shoes and trousers. Still none the wiser, he
meets a world-weary local whose only

with a passion, and takes
the improvement in his
daughter's health as a
sign of its power.
All this is set against esca-
lating violence in the
region, culminating in
Daniel being taken
hostage and returning to
cigarettes.
I really enjoyed this play.
The acting was superb and it wasn't the
depressing "insight into the human need
for direction" which the pamphlet
promised. I would definitely recommend
it, but if you have the £6.50 spare for tick-
ets there are still better things to see at the
National. My advice would be to wait until
it comes out on video, and go to see Judi
Dench instead, before she finishes.
