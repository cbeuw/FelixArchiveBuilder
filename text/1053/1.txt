The annual round of Sabbatical
Elections drew to a close this
week, after the lowest-ever
turnout. The results were
announced in Da Vinci's Bar on
Tuesday night amid laments
about the low turnout at South
Kensington, with St. Mary's rep-
resenting some 30% of the votes
cast. Others described the event
as 'anti-climatic', in view of the
amount of interest shown both in
the bar and at the ballot boxes.
The final results were: Eric
Allsop (President), Piers
Williams (Deputy President for
Finance and and Services), Sarah
Corneille (Deputy President for
Clubs and Societies) and Alex
Feakes (Felix editor and Print
Unit Manager).
The influence of Mary's has
caused some debate, given that
about 60% of the medical school
turned out, compared with only
8% of their South Kensington
counterparts. It has been specu-
lated that the outcome would
have been little different had
more South Kensington students

voted. Oily Newman, of the I C U
elections committee, went so far
as to say that "those Mary's votes
didn't make a difference at all."
Tim Townend, the current D P
(C&S) drew comparisons with
campus universities such as
Aston and Hull, which have com-
parable turnouts. He felt the low
showing at the polls was not
"much cause for concern". Last
year saw some 1209 votes cast,
which was down on the previous
year's of 1670. This year's was
less than 900.
The closest vote turned out
to be Alex's, due to the tradition-
al 'block vote' employed by
St. Mary's Students. Though
more than 200 voted for new
election, 64 rebelled by voting
for him. His overall winning mar-
gin was only 61 votes, out of a
total of 859 votes cast. Their
feelings were reflected by the rel-
atively hard time he was given at
the St.Mary's Hustings last week,
where it was alleged that his
reporting style had damaged the
cause of S M H M S S U in the
forthcoming BMS merger.
Eric Allsop was voted in far
more decisively, receiving more
than 60% of the votes cast, thus
beating Luke Morales and Mark

Planning Council finally granted
planning permission for the
Basic Medical Sciences building
project this week, after numer-
ous delays. The application went
before Wednesday's meeting
following submission of a report
and recommendations from
English Heritage.
E H were keen to stress that
they had no official objections to
the plans. As expected, they rec-
ommended only minor alter-
ations to the Norman Foster
designs, particularly in the
choice of stone cladding and
landscaping considerations. Ian
Caldwell, Director of Estates,
said that "It's full steam ahead
from here."
Phil Hilton from Schal
International confirmed that
they had been given the go-
ahead and said that demolition
equipment had already been
mobilised, to start work on
Monday. H e assured Felix that
they would make up the lost
time in six to eight weeks, which
would put the project back on
schedule for construction of the
building's basement.
