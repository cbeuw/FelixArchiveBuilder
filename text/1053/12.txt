album: the exploited -
beat the. .lucas
The band name is certainly amusing, particu-
larly because they exploit the fact that they have
been "exploited" to sell records. Whether you are
exploited or not, it all depends on your percep-
tion, and to call yourself such is indicative of a vic-
tim complex. Usually this is the root of the prob-
lem with those who have a bent towards paranoia
theories. In fact, the lyrics are littered with them
- particularly the polarisation of the "Us vs.
Them" situation. However this is necessary as
rhetoric and can be quite tangible. Though noth-
ing is written on their press release about them-
selves, perhaps most of their angry reactionary
tirade against "Them" is situationist, although it
could be, as mentioned, just a collective neurosis.
The industrial guitar onslaught is of the unre-
lenting and repetitive sort. This is no bad thing.
Serious numbers of brain cells were lost by this
scribe in headbanging heaven. The only problem
arises from the guitar solos. Some may argue that
they are the highlight; in certain circumstances
they are, but surely it's all about context.
In essence The Exploited sound like
Megadeth, but without the latter's penchant for
exotic rhythms and other-worldly scales. So, a
more apt description would be a more punk
approach to metal. (5)
gig: ash+scheer+
placebo+a.c. acoustics™
A C . Acoustics opened the show witnessed by
only a handful of people which was a shame.
Their set was tight, and almost every song was
interwoven with slow, passionate guitar rifts that
made the songs sounded majestic and mystical.
They were the best band to play that night.
Scheer were like Powder minus a track like
Afrodysiac'. They played with speed and intensi-
ty but unfortunately little else. The vocals bor-
dered on screams for most tracks and they are
likely to appeal to those who like heavy guitar rifts
(what else?) and nothing else. Pass please.
Placebo opened with their current single and
played with impressive intensity for a three piece.
They were miles ahead of Scheer and their heart
pumping rifts got the crowd warmed up.
Unfortunately the vocals were awful. Most bands
try to play harder to compensate for the obvious
lack of sensitivity in their vocals. That's what
Placebo did. They will probably be doomed to
playing fast tracks like the majority of indie bands
unless they work harder on their vocals.
Ash finally came on. The number of young
girls here was a welcome sight compared to what
we get at good old Imperial. It was obvious before
they even stmmmed a chord that they could be
complete toss and still get a standing ovation.
Unfortunately that was what happened.
What makes Ash different is their adoles-
cent, wise cracking humour that they bring into
their songs. Can anyone imagine Oasis or Blur
doing 'Girl From Mars' ? They sing with a kind of
sensitivity and innocence that puts a smile on your
face. Tonight, though, they were very disappoint-
ing. Tim Wheeler's vocals were weak while Angel
Interceptor' sounded so bland that I wondered
why I liked it in the first place. Ash have written
brilliant tunes but in a live set they were reduced
to mere novices.
I wanted so much to love Ash and to talk
about them after tonight. They have so much
potential but without working on their set, they
will probably end up selling records but little else.
Maybe they had a bad night, maybe they just
weren't sober... Whatever the reason, it was such
a shame.
