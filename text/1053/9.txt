Lilx-r Studiorum - Turner's book of studies is at the Clore
Gallery, Tate, Millbank. Entry is free. Picture shown is
'Norhain Castle on the River Tweed', 1824. The exhibition
is sponsored by Volkswagen.
The ("lore'Gallery normally houses
the permanent Turner exhibition
(1775 -1851), but until the 2nd of
June it is also showing prints from
bis book of studies Flie exhibition
gives a quick summary of his
approach and --the techniques
involved. One can clearly see the
influence of classical painting and
drawing as ft<§itemised (rfftf1
LeLorrain, but also the onset of a
new style. All the prints are ofWid-
scapes, mostly set in England,
which foreshadow thgiicornjng
romantic movement.

H k b i t f l B b l d s a copy of this and
Other works that clearly show
Turner's sources. Unfortunatelv,
there is very little coverage of his
own influence on Daguerre or
Constable, for example. Indeed,
the monochromatic prints (mostly
sepia) resemble unusually early
postcards, and just as Daguerre
used to fill his prints with colour,
Turner put touches of gouache on
his prints in a similar style.
The show offers a clear, non-
technical description of the process
of printing, through etching, mez-
zotint, aquatint and printing. The
amount of work involved is so large
that Turner only completed 71 of
the intended 100 prints and in
1819, twelve years after starting,
the project was abandoned.
However, the works were clear and
didactic, each print making its own
statement and each a genuine study
of light and form. The result made
his name and his fortune.
Though the show is quite small
(only two rooms), it gives a clear
picture of the liber Studiorum,
thanks to the presentation of vari-
ous stages in the printing process.
One can see how a picture evolved
from a simple representation to
almost an allegory of the subject.
This is not a window into the past,
but more a question of rhetoric.
This academic style of art is ideally
suited to honing technique. It is all
well and good going for the pic-
tures, but the artist's approach is far
more interesting.
