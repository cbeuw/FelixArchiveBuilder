Our full title is the Imperial College Science
Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Society, but if
you thought this meant that our interests
were limited to reading about spaceships,
lasers, swords, dragons, vampires and blood,
then think again. We also enjoy examining
these aspects in many forms of visual art, so
why not join us when we visit the Spellbound
exhibition at the Hayward Gallery this com-
ing Wednesday?
With pieces of cinematic art from Terry
Gilliam [Brazil, Time Bandits), Ridley Scott
[Alien, Blade Runner), Peter Greenaway
[Prospero's Books), Damien Hirst (dead ani-
mals in tanks) and even Hitchcock's Psycho
running at 3 frames per second, this is defi-
nitely worth a visit. So for at least one mind-
expanding experience this week, meet on
Wednesday 13th at 1:30 pm outside the icsf
library in the south west corner of Beit Quad.
While we're on the subject, the library
contains over 3000 books and videos, based
on a surprisingly wide variety of themes, not
all of them nerd-related. (Anyone care for an
argument about the fantastical aspects of
Shakespeare's works?)
Come and have a look - you'd be very
welcome!
