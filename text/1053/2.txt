I n t e r n a t i o n a l N i g h t v e r d i c t : 'brilliant'
P H O T O : I V A N C H A N
Fourteen different nations were represented in the show.
BY ROBIN RILEY
Last Friday's Overseas Comm-
ittee's International night was
attended by over 700 staff, stu-
dents and their families.
The evening began in the
usual manner as guests were
given the chance to taste the tra-
ditional foods of the countries
represented. The carefully pack-
aged Singaporean delicacies
quickly disappeared, while the
large-scale operation of the
Indian society catered for a long
and fast-moving queue. For a
short time it seemed that the
food fair might be a little too suc-
cessful: serving from the Italian
stall had to be curtailed in order
to persuade the appreciative
audience to leave the dining hall
and take their seats for the con-
cert.
The fast-paced show that
followed consisted of a presenta-
tion from students from fourteen
different nations, cleverly inter-
laced with slide shows and com-
mentary. The audience filling the
Great Hall was treated to a daz-
zling array of costumes, music
and dancing. The show's high-
lights included fashion shows,
clashing dragons, and an entranc-
ing belly dance by a member of
the Lebanese society.
Particularly well-received
was the hilarious short play from
the Indian Society about the
ignorance of a cockney lad of
Asian descent concerning his
grandparents' homeland. The
Afro-Caribbean society's dynam-
ic and politically aware but joyful
celebration of the history and
culture of the African people was
also rapturously received.
The night finished with a
huge party, with live music and a
disco occupying the Senior and
Junior Common Rooms.
Unaffected by restrictive licens-
ing laws, all those present danced
and drank well into the small
hours, long after the Union stew-
ards had pushed the last few die-
hards from Beit Quad.
Interviewed shortly after-
wards G . Tan, the OSC's
Honourary Junior Treasurer, said
"I think it went pretty well...
there were no real problems. A
few more mistakes were made
last year." Other students con-
gratulated the O S C on organising
the night, arguably now estab-
lished as Imperial's principle
social event of the year. I C U
President Sarah White said "I
thought it was bloody brilliant."
News in brief
Kidnapped!
BY ANDY SINHARAY
Sarah White, Imperial College
Union president, went missing
from her office on Tuesday
night, apparently appropiated by
medical students as a Rag stunt.
Before being 'abducted' a
parting message was left on
Sarah's answering machine:
"Hello, it's Sarah, I've been kid-
napped. Can you cancel my
meetings today?" It is believed
that students from St Mary's are
responsible, though there have
been allegations that the Deputy
President, Tim Townend, may
have assisted them.
Reports have reached Felix
suggesting that the medics, on
the last day of St Mary's Rag
Week, attempted to kidnap the
the Union president of Charing
Cross and Westminster Medical
School. The potential presiden-
tial thieves were foiled when
Police intervention prevented
the students getting near C X W ' s
Union. Denied their usual quarry
the students raided I C U instead.
As Felix went to press, St Mary's
Rag were unavailable for com-
ment. Sarah did not reappear in
the I C U offices until Wednesday
night.
"They strung me up like
this" she said, demonstrating a
cross-like posture, "I was there
for six hours... they had to feed
me themselves." The medics
apparently plaster-cast her arms
and shoulders, and wouldn't let
her go to the toilet.
A bemused but unharmed
Miss White was later seen in Da
Vinci's recovering from her
ordeal. Still smiling, Sarah com-
plained that nobody had gone to
look for her, and that the ransom
demand for her had been refused
by the Union office. The other
sabbaticals didn't seem too put
out by her sudden disappearance,
one remarking philosphically that
"they could keep her."
With the regard to her meet-
ings, one member of college staff
told Felix that he had merely
been informed by I C U that
Sarah had been off sick.

University challenge?
The next round of IC's bid to
win University Challenge will be
screened next Wednesday. The
group from Imperial steamed
through to the second round of
the television quiz after beating
St Andrews University in the
first round.
The team, consisting of Jim
Totty, Nick Bradshaw, Chris
Harrison and captain Mark
Pallen, face Lancaster University
in the show to be transmitted on
March 13th on BBC 2.
Charity funds 'not for
equipment'
The Association of Medical
Research Charities has expressed
concern that they are increasing-
ly being asked to pay for major
pieces of equipment. They say
they will not pay for university
infrastructure, insisting that such
funding remains the responsibilty
of the National Health Service.
Some smaller charities have
expresed fears that they might
be compelled to pay for basic
equipment, offices, computers,
insurance and rent if they want
to establish a unit in a university
in the future.
In the past, larger research
charities have helped where they
could with flexible long term
support and funds for new initia-
tives and buildings. There is evi-
dence that they have been asked
to meet more of the costs in the
past five years.
Unlucky for some
A report commissioned by an
audience awareness group in
America into the nature of movie
'baddies' has revealed that scien-
tists are twice as likely as any
other professional group to be
killed in Hollywood films.
The research shows that it
doesn't matter whether or not
the high-foreheaded boffin is
plotting to overthrow the world,
or just collaborating to save it,
the scientist is always the first to
get it in the neck in the flicks.
