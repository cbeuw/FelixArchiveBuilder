Environmental Links
With Moscow
BY T H E NEWS STAFF
In a groundbreaking move,
Imperial College, through its
Centre for Environmental
Technology, has linked up with
the Moscow Engineering Physics
Institute (MEPhI) to embark on a
joint nuclear safety training
programme.
The scheme, designated the
Training and Academic Link
Project (TACL) will be initiated
this October. Its aims are to
support sponsored visits by
Russian trainees from MEPhI and
to enable the flow of ideas
between the two institutes.
Tony Goddard, Professor of
Environmental Safety, is
enthusiastic about the scheme:
"This is a good match. Both
institutions are science based and
have a strong interest in nuclear
safety research and training."
Graduate Tax
BY DECLAN CURRY
University bosses have called for
students to pay more for higher
education. The Committee of
Vice Chancellors and Principals,
in a report published last week,
proposed the introduction of a
controversial 'graduate tax'.
Under the plans, students would
pay an extra 2% of their salaries
in tax after they graduate. The
scheme is expected to net
between £4000 and £9000 million
for Government coffers, and
independent consultants London
Economics say the tax could
finance as much as 90% of the
current cost of higher education.
The plans have been
condemned by the Association of
University Teachers. Research
officer Conor Cradden said that
"working class students would
suffer most" from the proposals.
Labour's Tony Lloyd, ducking
questions about his own party's
moves towards the scheme,
warned against "blundering" into
a graduate tax without "properly
considering the dangers". A
spokeswoman for the National
Union of Students said it was too
early to comment on the
proposals. The N U S president,
Loma Fitzsimmons, is known as a
committed supporter of the idea
behind the tax, and argued in its
favour during the early stages of
her campaign for NUS president.
Student Loan Raids
BY THE NEWS STAFF
Bailiffs have been called in to raid
the homes of three graduates and
seize £1,100 worth of property in
order to repay their debts.
In the first case of its kind, the
Student Loan Company asked
county courts to grant search and
seize orders to reclaim property to
the value of loans given to the
three when they were students.
The company has also hired
private debt collectors in the
United States, France, Germany
and Canada to chase more than
200 borrowers now living abroad.
Ron Harrison, the company's
chief executive, said: "We are
moving into a new phase as we
step up efforts to re-gain taxpayers
money."
Meanwhile, a survey by
Barclays Bank shows that eight
out of ten students ended the last
academic year in debt. Interviews
with 3,000 students in twelve
universities show that student debt
has risen by 22% in one year. The
average overdraft is now £1,672,
and most undergraduates are
expected to owe £1,900 by the end
of their courses.
Editorial
With every new editor comes a new style to Felix. Unfortunately, as
this will be the only summer edition, you won't see the full extent of
the changes until the start of next term. Hopefully this has given you
a taste of what's in store.
This summer has seen Felix move out of the dark ages and into
the technological era. We can at last produce most of Felix on
computers instead of using a very archaic typesetter. We owe a big
thank you to ICU Publications Board for buying the laser printer, IC
Trust for buying a computer and monitor (by the way, can we have
the cheque now?) and ICU Finance Committee for the donation.
The only thing we need now is a scanner so that, instead of being
manually pasted up, the photographs can be dropped straight into
the text on the computer. If anyone has a 1200 dpi scanner laying
idle, we'd be love to hear from you.
The next issue will be out on 4th October.
Thanks To...
Steve Newhouse, this issue would not have been possible without all
your help and advice.
Rose Atkins for all the typing and cups of coffee.
Andy Thompson for printing, sorry it was all left to the last minute.

You Only Get An
'Ooooh . ..'
BY ANDREW TSENG,
NEWS EDITOR
Two researchers at Imperial
College have solved one of the
great tea mysteries.
Professor Michael Spiro and
Dr Deogratius Jaganyi, of the
Chemistry department, have
discovered the reason for the
formation of a film of scum when
a cup of tea is brewed with hard
water.
By using a scanning electron
microscope, an ultraviolet laser
and a variety of analysis methods,
the researchers have found that
the amount of scum formed was
dependant on the length of time,
the oxygen content of the air and
the surface area of the tea.
The paper, written by Professor
Spiro and Dr Jaganyi and
published in Nature, describes the
scum as, "a complex organic
material derived from the
oxidation of tea solubles mediated
by calcium salts and accompanied
by calcium carbonate.".
Much of their research used
Typhoo tea bags. The result of the
studies were that drinkers of
ordinary tea can have 'scumless'
tea simply by adding lemon
instead of milk, or by making an
extra strong cuppa.
However, for those who are not
connoisseurs of lemon tea,
Professor Spiro has another
solution: "You could always take
it off with a spoon.".
