Head Off To Surrey Suicide Shock
The Physics department of
Imperial College is still in shock
after the suicide last weekend of
one of its students.
Stephen Shaw, 22, died on
Saturday afternoon after falling
from the roof of the Physics
building. He was an Imperial
College graduate who was
studying Semiconductor Science
and Technology, a joint M S c
course with King's College,
London.
A n inquest is being held, but
the police do not suspect foul
play.
Science In Decline
Professor Patrick Dowling, Head of the Civil Engineering Department,
has been appointed Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University
of Surrey. He succeeds Professor Anthony Kelly who retires at the end of
September 1994.
Patrick Dowling has been at Imperial College since 1968,
having been British Steel Research Fellow, Reader and Professor during
his time at the College. He was elected a Fellow of Britain's Royal
Academy of Engineering in 1981 and is currently the President-elect of
the Institution of Structural Engineers.
"I am greatly looking forward to the challenge at Surrey, a
University I view as being upwardly mobile. However I shall sorely miss
Imperial College where I have spent almost all my life." His appointment
takes effectfrom 1 October 1994.

Medical research is suffering from
an "anti science" mood, according
to the president of the British
Association. Professor Sir David
Weatherall, speaking in advance
of next week's British Association
annual meeting in Keele, said
young people are blaming science
for environmental problems, and
are frightened by the "Jurassic
Park" image of genetic
engineering.
Sir David's comments came as
the Government was urged to
make science 'more sexy' in
schools. Dr Ann Robinson, head
of the Institute of Director's
policy unit, said Britain's
competitive position would be
threatened unless more students
study science. Dr Robinson said
business and the Government
should launch a national campaign
to promote science.
The British Association
meeting runs throughout next
week. Professor David Phillips,
head of Chemistry at Imperial
College, w i l l lecture on the
healing powers of light on
Wednesday. Science Minister,
W i l l i a m Waldegrave, in his
speech on Thursday, is expected
to announce new measures to
encourage the public
understanding of science.
CAD Office Moved
The C A D Project Team has
moved from 45 Princes Gardens.
They can now be found in
room 203 on the ground floor of
the Electrical Engineering
department (past the sign saying
'Goods Lift'). They can still be
contacted on extension 3426.
Opposition To Student Union Reforms
BY DECLAN CURRY
Voluntary membership is facing a
new threat this week, with a
former education minister telling
Felix that he will vote against
Government plans for student
union reform.
Robert Jackson, higher
education minister at the time of
the 1988 Government inquiry into
student union 'abuses', says he
cannot support plans that will give
the government new, extended
powers over universities. He
added his concern "for university
autonomy, but not for the unions
themselves". The former minister
added that, if there was a vote in
the House of Commons, he expects
to be joined in the opposition
lobby by other Tory rebels. "The
Government has a small majority,"
said Mr Jackson. "It would only
take six or eight Conservative
MPs to vote against it."
With a majority in the
Commons of seventeen, the
Government can be defeated if
nine of its MPs vote with all the
opposition parties. Mr Jackson's
comments now make defeat on
voluntary membership possible, as
both Labour and the Liberal
Democrats say they will oppose
the proposals to split student
union funding into core and non-
core areas (for more details on the
proposals and their implications,
see the article on page 6).
The developing revolt is being
monitored with alarm by
ministers at the Department for
Education, who have already been
defeated once this year in a House
of Lords vote on university
autonomy. Junior education
minister Baroness Blatch, who
then announced the scrapping of
plans to extend the powers of
Education Secretary John Patten,
is said by Conservative sources to
oppose the student union reforms.
This is yet another problem for
the beleaguered Mr Patten, who
returned to work this week after
recovering from a mystery viral
infection. The Education
Secretary told the Conservative
Part conference in November
1992 that the "NUS closed shop
must go, and soon". M r Patten,
and higher education minister,
Tim Boswell, are being lobbied by
the National Union of Students
and Conservative Student, once
trenchant supporters of voluntary
membership. New Conservative
Students chairman, Tim Keevan,
is understood to have submitted a
paper to M r Boswell, expressing
concern that too many clubs and
societies will be killed off by the
Government plans. The
Government has now extended the
consultation period to 1st
November, closing off any change
of legislation being detailed when
MPs return after their summer
holidays.
