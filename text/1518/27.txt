SLITHERLINK
Slitherlink, a bigger celebrity than
any of those wannabees who fre-
quent Ethos or Eastside.
The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed loop
by connecting the dots. The num-
bers in each square indicate how
many edges of the square are part
of the loop, so if it contains a
“2”, you know that two and only
two out of four edges have lines.
That’s all the info you need to get
the one logical answer (though
waiting a week to see the solution
will also do). Answers to puzzles.
felix@imperial.ac.uk. We can’t
get enough of your answers, genu-
inely.

Nonogram – Standard
The cells in a grid have to be coloured or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid. The numbers measure
how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. The overall solution should yield
some sort of picture. As usual, answers to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Ever since we discov-
ered that last week’s
Wordoku contained a
grave error we’ve lost
all confidence in our
own abilities and are
currently embarking
on a pilgrimage to
Tibet.
Solutions will be
back next week, as
ever, once we’ve car-
ried out enough ex-
tensive soul search-
ing.
Remember, if you
ever want to submit

On Wednesday, Felix received
the following anonymous mes-
sage consisting of the charac-
ters (dash not included): te67r-
t67r67e567er6754675674567456746
While most of the office think it’s noth-
ing but spam, a select few have other
ideas.
What could it mean? Is it the mother
of all tip-offs? Revelations that could
threaten the very foundations of soci-
ety? The Rector’s Steam ID? The pos-
sibilities are endless.
We need your help. Crack the code
and receive massive points and/or an
incredible reward.
Or, you know, just let us know that
it’s spam. We’ll only feel a little let
down. Get hacking!
Wish you were here

Crack the Da
Vinci Code
But let’s face it, it’s probably
spam
