The puzzling problem with ponderings
I
’m in the grips of a dilemma. Oh
dear.
But yet I’m strangely glad: I
like being in trouble; I like hav-
ing a problem to solve. This
may sound odd. After all, if I’m content
with my situation, is there even a prob-
lem at all? Technically, no. But I’m not
content with my situation, that’s why
there’s a problem – what I’m glad of is
having the problem. Confused yet? So
am I. Is your left arm tingling and do
you feel a bit nauseous too? No? Oh,
must be just me then.
There are a few reasons why I en-
joy a good dilemma. For one thing, it
keeps me busy. They say idle hands are
the devil’s playthings and this is true.
But hands can only do so many things.
They’re practical, yes, but they lack
imagination. But the mind is limitless
in its possibility and an idle mind is ca-
pable of no end of trouble. If idle hands
are the devil’s playthings, they must be
like Hotwheels. An idle mind then is
like handing the devil the keys to his
dad’s Ferrari.
But it’s more than that. If I were
without a problem to mull over, a
mental crumb stuck between the teeth
of my consciousness to tongue relent-
lessly, I’m quite sure I would get bored
very quickly. And as a good medic,
I know that the brain is a muscle – I
didn’t say I was a smart medic – and
like any muscle, if you don’t use it, you
lose it. Like a large proportion of Im-
perial College, I have vested interest in
keeping my mind in peak mental condi-
tion and nothing keeps it in shape like
a tough, tricksy teaser. It’s like a good
round on the bench-press, except with-
out the sweating, straining and short,
short shorts in public.
And then there’s the perfect joy that
comes when the veil of fog lifts, the fish
scales fall away and at once, with the
utmost clarity, you can see the solution
before your eyes. It’s all so simple –
how you didn’t see before is a mystery,
but that becomes irrelevant when you
marvel at the beauty of it. The giddy
euphoria you feel is twofold; not only
have you done away that pesky thorn
in your paw but because you worked it
through all by yourself, it feels doubly
good. In that strange microcosm of life
that is the morning commute on the
Piccadilly line, completing the sudoku
is as the sweetest ambrosia. We haven’t
created the drugs – or the words – yet to
properly describe the high that comes
with the mythical feat of cracking the
cryptic crossword.
A problem is also a reminder that
things can be better. In this sense, pre-
dicaments show there is still room for
improvement, which is great! No mat-
ter how good today is, knowing that to-
morrow can be better still is something
worth getting out of bed for. Argu-
ably, if life were perfect, without even
the smallest of problems, then things
could only go downhill – which itself
is quite the conundrum! Society only
moves forward to get past its succes-
sive problems. Stone tablets were great
but a bit heavy so we invented paper.
Handwritten books were OK but mass
dissemination was a bit tricky so we
created the printing press. Sexy women
are sexy but they don’t like talking to
us much in bars so the chat-up line was
born.
And the dilemma that spurred all of
this? Should I really write an article
about dilemmas? On reflection, I don’t
think so.

H
as it ever occurred to you
just how much of our
modern lives are lived
via screens? I am sit-
ting here writing this on
my laptop, which has been switched on
ever since I decided to watch a cheeky
episode of Green Wing over breakfast.
My mobile phone has been within a two
metre radius of my person all day. My
housemates and I are considering pop-
ping to the cinema later. No doubt the
lectures I will attend this week will be
conducted via a projector screen. Even
if I wanted to escape, I would no doubt
be bombarded with screens and moni-
tors in supermarkets, tube stations, and
even just walking innocently down the
street.
My question is whether this is a bad
thing? Should we be worried about our
ever-increasing reliance on this virtual
world? When a seven-year old has a tan-
trum on the tube because she has been
forced to wait three seconds too long for
her top-of-the-range mp3 player, I think
there may be something wrong.
Don’t get me wrong, modern technol-
ogy has the potential to enrich our lives
in countless ways. Google Earth is about
to launch a street view type simulation
of the Great Barrier Reef, allowing you
to dive down and ‘virtually’ explore to
depths of up to a hundred metres, all
from the comfort of your own home.
The wealth of scientific knowledge on
the internet is endless, meaning that
most of us at Imperial probably use the
library about 10% as often as we access
online resources. Restaurants are re-
placing waitresses with iPads. You can
shop online, deliver flowers to relatives
Think about it: are you nomophobic?
in Australia, stay connected with child-
hood friends who would otherwise be
complete strangers… it’s actually hard
to think of any aspect of life that some
sort of screen can’t help you with.
But are we becoming too reliant on
this kind of thing? Perhaps even to the
extent that we are actually afraid if we
are out of contact with our virtual lives.
A recent article published in the Tele-
graph (who am I kidding, I read the
Evening Standard version) states that
two thirds of the UK population suffer
from this fear, one aspect of which has
been catchily termed nomophobia (no
mobile phobia, officially defined as fear
of losing or being without your mobile
phone). If you delve further into the re-
sults, 77% of 18-24 year olds (that’s us)
are nomophobic; and women are a little
more afraid than men, however this is
reportedly only because men tend to
have a second spare phone knocking
about. The problem has become so ter-
ribly grave that an advice website has
been launched to help people cope with
the extreme stress and anxiety caused
by this condition. Even though the site
is extremely basic and low-budget, I’m
almost entirely sure that it’s not in fact
a piss-take. Instead of giving pointers
on getting these people some seriously
needed perspective into their lives, the
‘Top Tips’ section on nomophobia.
com offers “some immediate protec-
tion from nomophobia by [avoiding] a
range of the most common reasons why
people lose mobile phone contact”.
I was in fact recently in the unfortu-
nate situation of being without a phone
for a few weeks. My poor faithful brick
of a phone, so sturdy and reliable up un-
til that point, lost a fight with a pint of
Fosters and never recovered. Now for
the first few days I was indeed in a mild
state of shock and feeling horrendously
disconnected from the world, but af-
ter a while my sense of panic began to
diminish. I started arranging to meet
people at specific times and places, in-
stead of the usual “call me when you get
there”. I spent more time on Facebook,
as a result, sure, but once I was out and
about I did feel a certain sense of the
liberation that technophobes and hip-
pies are always banging on about. In-
stead of thinking about my phone all the
time, whether I had a message or a no-
tification, I was actually listening to the
people I was with. Instead of burying
my nose in my mobile while on the bus,
Good news: we got a great picture.
Bad news: someone in the Felix office needs a new phone. Sorry...

I would read a book on the way home,
or just take time to look around or out of
the window. It was on one of these oc-
casions that I realised that a total of five
people out of the nine in the back seat
of the bus were glued to iPhones, even
a pensioner who looked like she could
barely see. And I wondered: are these
people actually doing something mean-
ingful on those phones? Or are they
just filling time by browsing pointless
websites or messaging people unneces-
sarily? Because now that I have finally
got round to replacing my phone, those
are the things I’ve gone back to doing
on my boring bus rides home. And al-
though I’m feeling better connected, I
kind of hope that I will never become a
nomophobic.
