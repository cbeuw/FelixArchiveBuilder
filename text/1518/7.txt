Various pieces of sound

were broken on one of
the nights of the event,
and the venue is
charging £3,972
for it. Henry

(who were one of the head-
liners of the night) for “incom-
petence and/or the venue, for not
having a correctly configured system”.
The Union were asked for assistance in
recovering the loss of the PA breakage,
however, at the time of writing, they
haven’t responded to the request.
The ticket sales for the event, which
were previously not known, have also
been reported and the income gener-
ated has been added to the money to
update the figure. The total capacity
of the event was 2,045. Tickets were
sold through the box office at The
Troxy as well as via Time Out, KGB
(an organisation that sells tickets, not
the Russian secret service – unless they
are moonlighting in a sushi restaurant,
which they aren’t), in physical form
to family and friends of the perform-
ers and organisers, and available for
purchase on the door. The box office
tickets were night specific; the other
pre-event tickets were not. For the Sat-
urday show, 362 tickets were sold with
Sunday garnering 236 ticket sales by
the box office. Time Out and KGB tick-
et sales were 38 and 95/96 (which of
the numbers is still not known) respec-
tively. Paper tickets are estimated to be
roughly 80, but the income from them
was intermittently streamed into other

income, and so an exact figure is hard
to say. Of the night specific tickets, 17
and 14 tickets were bought on the door
on Saturday and Sunday respectively.
Fusion has been planned since before
the start of this academic year. Over
the summer, the incoming Sabbatical
officers were made aware of the event
by the previous year’s officers and
Monya Zard, Deputy President (Clubs
& Societies) had regular meetings with
Angela Udemba. Monya Zard said
that Fusion had a “tremendous amount
of support” from the Union, with her
and Michael Foster, Deputy President
(Finances & Services) having regular
meetings with Fusion (namely Angela
Udemba, Heather Jones and Chris
Darby – the producer of the event,
who eventually dropped out). Before
Christmas, after the Masquerade Ball,
Fusion and the Union had a meeting
to discuss “mitigating risk and set up
a timescale for how and when [they
would] meet ticket sales targets”. The
targets were not met.
When searching for reasons for the
failure of the event and the low ticket
sales, many different possible prob-
lems were given. Monya Zard said that
it was “location, the fact that there’s so
much to do in London, and that there
were other shows going on at the same
time”. The distance of the venue was
dismissed, as The Troxy has worked
well in the past. The price of the tickets
(£18-40) was also blamed, as possibly
putting students off buying a ticket.
The fact that the main show took place
at the same time as many of the other
big societies were having their annual
events (such as East Meets West, M
Night, and I Night) was also pointed to
as a contributing factor. Also, Monya
Zard said that it may not have had “an
established member base, but it did
have 150 people who were trying to
sell tickets” and so could have been as
successful as M Night and other simi-
lar events, which have an almost guar-
anteed base attendance. She dismissed
this possible factor as “not necessarily
the reason why the ticket sales were
low”. When asked why the event was
successful in York and not successful
in London, Monya Zard said that it
was due to the difference in the enter-
tainment scenes of the two cities, with
there being much more variety in Lon-
don.
The Masquerade Ball was described
as a “massive party”, which a large
amount of people enjoy. The main
event was a show, which was sug-
gested to the Union to be not as in tune
with what manner of event students
realistically like to attend. This sugges-
tion was dismissed, with the examples
of M Night and others previously men-
tioned used to justify that the structure
was sound.
The original treasurer had to drop
out, due to work commitments, and so
Heather Jones, former Deputy Presi-
dent (Clubs & Societies) stepped in.
She said that she was “surprised that
such an ambitious budget had been
approved”. The reason given by the
Union for such a large scale event be-
ing approved was that Angela Udemba
had already run an event of a similar
scale, and that many senior, experience
members of the Union were heavily in-
volved in the planning and execution
stages. She did, however, comment that
Fusion’s expenditure was “ultimately
under-budget”. Heather Jones stated
that she felt her role as treasurer was
to: “ensure the budget passed by A&E
Exec (the board that govern activities
and entertainments) was adhered to”.
According to her, the task of managing
so many transactions was difficult, and
made much harder by the “limitations
of the Union finance systems”.
Fusion does not consider the event to
have been a complete failure and will
be hoping to continue. If the event goes
ahead next year it will have to start
from the loss it has made and hope to
make the money back. There may be an
afterparty, or some other such similar
event, to attempt to make back some of
the money.
Felix will be trying to find out what
safeguards will be put in place to en-
sure similar loses are not incurred by
other events, such as the upcoming
Summer Ball.
