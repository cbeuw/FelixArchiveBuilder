Hall seniors at Wilson House have
been left questioning the future of their
traditionally guaranteed accommoda-
tion.
As reported last week, it emerged
that Wilson House had been removed
from Imperial’s accommodation web-
site for prospective students ahead of
a refurbishment next academic year,
with new Waterloo-based hall ‘Xenia’
being posted in its stead. Hall Seniors
hired by Wilson House last term have
now been informed that they may not
be guaranteed accommodation, even
elsewhere.
Students at Wilson House have ex-
hibited their frustration with the ongo-
ing situation. One Wilson student in-
volved closely in hall life, who wished
to anonymous, commented on the lack
of communication there has been from
the College on the issue.
“There had been hints for a long
time about Wilson’s refurbishment, but
the impression given [by College] was
that any hired seniors while not being
able to stay in Wilson next year, would
definitely be required elsewhere.”
“There has been no clear guidance ...Continued on Page 3

Frustration about future of ac-
commodation for seniors
from College, and it has negatively im-
pacted on the Seniors.”
The capacity of accommodation for
next year’s intake across Imperial ac-
commodation has also been taken into
question. College are actively seeking
65 extra bed spaces externally in order
to guarantee the required number of
spaces for first year students, with war-
dens across Imperial being discouraged
from recruiting more Hall Seniors until
the situation is resolved.
The Wilson House-based student
continued:
“Students shouldn’t be the ones in-
convenienced - especially if they have
to unexpectedly search for accommo-
dation during exam time. Some indi-
viduals have had to cancel their plans
to live with groups of friends in private
accommodation to take on this op-
portunity. It seems that the College is
happy to leave people hanging.”
The student was also keen to stress
the fact that Hall Seniors now have to
pay for their accommodation like any
other hall-based resident, and so do
not take on the role “for any financial
gain.”
