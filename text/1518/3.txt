spective students on the Imperial web-
site. Orient House, based in Fulham,
has also been removed.

ary, Graduate Students’ Association
President Robert Tang said that en-

Following on from his comment ar-
ticle published on 2 March, Union
President Scott Heath has confirmed
a date for the General Meeting. The
meeting will be held on Wednesday 6
June in SAF Lecture Theatre G34.
The General Meeting is an open fo-
rum that can be attended by any union
member. With a usual attendance of
200 members, any person can add an
item to the discussion agenda. The
last General Meeting at Imperial was
held five years ago.
Scott Heath said that the purpose of
the meeting was to discuss alterations
to the constitution. This constitution
will be passed formally in the Union
Council on Monday 11 June. The
main aims of the meeting involve pre-
paring for the changing environment
over the next five years at Imperial.
Some of the points that will be dis-
cussed are the removal of universal
lunch times, the development of the
co-curriculum and the implementa-
tion of £9k tuition fees.
Even though some of the changes
that are to be discussed are minor, the
Sabbatical team decided that there
should be a separate location to talk
about the rationale behind any deci-
sions. As well as ask questions and
debate the implementations of these
changes.
The Sabbatical team remits will
be reviewed, where they were last
changed since the split of the Edu-
cation and Welfare roles. Also, the
membership of the Trustee Board and
other union committees will be as-
sessed and how the union functions as
a whole will be discussed.
The materials relating to the pro-
posals and discussion of the General
Meeting will be released in the week
of 28 May to give members sufficient
time to read it through before the ac-
tually meeting.
“The main aims of
the meeting involves
preparing for the
changing environ-
ment at Imperial”
