Stop right now, thank you very much, I need somebody with the human blood
For a vampire who was cursed and
buried alive in the late 1760s, the year
1972 is understandably a strange and
mysterious world. This is the challenge
that Barnabas Collins (Depp) is faced
with. Born to rich parents who own a
large fishing business as well as their
own Collinswood Manor, Collins in his
youth makes the mistake of having a
short fling with the dangerous and jeal-
ous witch Angelique (Green). Failing
to return her love, he irks the talented
sorceress and finds out there is noth-
ing scarier than a woman scorned. First
manipulating his true love to fall off a
cliff, she transforms him into a vam-
pire, forcing him to suffer the loss of
his loved one forever. Turning the torch
and pitchfork-wielding villagers against
him, she succeeds in burying him alive.
His freedom comes nearly 200
years later when a group of construc-
tion workers accidentally break him
out of his coffin, and incidentally all
get sucked dry by the thirsty vampire.
After a few comical confrontations he
shares with modern developments he
advantage of, as Barnabas learns that it
is possible for women to become doc-
tors, and 15-year-olds do not generally
get married and become pregnant de-
spite the fullness of their childbearing
womb. He also insists The Carpenters
are not singers but individuals dealing
with woods. In the gothic setting of its
run-down mansion, impossibly white-
powdered stars, and constant shots of
the death-inviting cliff and the waves
crashing into sharp rocks to remind
us of a foreboding future, Burton finds
time for humour, mostly centred around
the shock Barnabas encounters as he
starts experiencing a completely differ-
ent world.
But there is a drastic shift in tone as
Angelique enters the picture. The com-
edy is tragically cut short, and we enter
an even weirder femme-fatale, Fatal
Attraction-esque love-hate interaction
between the vampire and the witch.
The icy Depp and fiery Green make
an interesting pair at first, but once it
becomes clear that there is really noth-
ing further to develop between the two
characters, even the wild “sex” scene
in which the two of them fly and crash
around Angelique’s office for some pas-
sionate hugging (that’s all they do) to a
classic Barry White song, feels stale.
Although Green looks the part of an
unforgiving wench, her powerful witch
doesn’t have much to do. She acts as
the tough CEO of her company, but she
never makes the adequate villain, and
it’s a wonder why anyone needs to be
afraid of her. Given the large cast full of
familiar names, hardly anyone is given
proper attention to, and among the most
wasted of the ensemble is Carter, who
is barely seen, does hardly anything
memorable, and is tossed aside, never to
be seen again. Miller is also given vir-
tually no time to shine, and he too, is
gone in a rushed subplot. The two chil-
dren remain insignificant throughout,
whether it’s the rebellious Caroline or
the innocent David.
Making something out of her sup-
porting role is the divine Pfeiffer who,
as the strong head of household, adds a
touch of class and glamour to the cast,
and as the only character who has any
substantial relationship with Collins,
Pfeiffer strongly holds her own, and she
also doesn’t look too shabby confidently
protecting her home and family from
invaders with a shotgun.
Burton tries to manage a lot of genres
here, but whilst doing so, he cannot
quite grasp a single one correctly. Is this
a comedy? A gothic horror? Supernatu-
ral fantasy? He dabbles with far more
than he can handle, which can also be
said for the underused cast he has as-
sembled. Dark Shadows remains faith-
ful to Burton’s well-known and praised
visual flair, but the content never stays
strong throughout, and the overblown
ending with its sudden necessity to
produce some kind of a happy end-
ing is a bit of a letdown. Still, Depp is
as impressive as ever, proving there is
no contemporary actor who can come
close to skillfully tackling the roles he
does on a regular basis.
is not at all familiar with, such as the
big letter M signalling a McDonald’s
restaurant, and his careful mistrust of
the newly laid-down concrete road, he
makes his way back to Collinswood,
only to discover his beloved mansion
almost in ruins. The residents include
his four descendants, Elizabeth (Pfei-
ffer), her brother Roger (Miller), Eliza-
beth’s daughter Caroline (Moretz) and
Roger’s son David (McGrath), their
butler Willie (Haley), family psychia-
trist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Carter), a very
old nanny (Ray Shirley) whose purpose
throughout the film isn’t entirely clear,
and finally the new family governess
Victoria (Bella Heathcote).
Despite her reserved feelings for in-
viting a vampire into her home, the
family matriarch Elizabeth welcomes
the return of her ancestor, and fills him
in on what he’s missed over the past
two centuries. Basically, the fishing
business Barnabas’ parents worked so
hard to build is no more, ever since An-
gelique the cursing witch took over al-
most everything, exacting vengeance on
a family she despises. Always putting
his bloodline first, Barnabas swears
to restore their business to its former
glory, and so begins the Collins fam-
ily’s extreme makeover backed by the
70s megahit, The Carpenters’ ‘Top of
the World.’
So far, Dark Shadows looks and
sounds like an offbeat comedy in
which the goofy and stiff Depp does
and says the oddest things. There are
priceless moments that Depp takes full
