So Felix might not have known about Will Smith’s
surprise visit to Ethos on Wednesday, but that didn’t
stop Hangman from having a few select words with
the man himself:
Hangman: Hi Will.
Will: Hi there.
H: So are you a big sports fan?
W: Sure. Don’t forget to come and see my latest film,
Men in Black III, when it opens next Friday 25 May!
H: Always a pleasure, Will.
NEXTWEEK...
