We warmly invite you to attend a free public lecture hosted by The Royal College of
Radiologists on Monday 18 June 2012.
We are delighted to welcome Dr Kevin Harrington from The Institute of Cancer
Research, who will give this lecture on ‚ÄòRadiation & smart drugs: Homing in on
cancer‚Äôs Achilles‚Äô heel‚Äô.
‚ÄúIn the last two decades, we have begun to understand the
importance of genes in preventing and causing cancer. As
part of this process, we have identified specific abnormalities
in cancer cells that make them very different from normal
cells. Importantly, some of these changes (or mutations) in
cancer cells make them resistant to the standard treatments,
such as radiation and chemotherapy, that have been used for
many years. However, because cancer cells come to rely on
these mutations to allow them to survive, grow and spread,
they represent a potential weak spot in a tumour‚Äôs defences.
Therefore, by developing new drugs that attack cancer cells
through their Achilles‚Äô heel, we may be able to improve the
effects of radiotherapy in treating a range of tumour types. In
this lecture, I will discuss a number of examples that are
already allowing us to achieve better treatment results and will
introduce others that hold enormous promise for the future.‚Äù
