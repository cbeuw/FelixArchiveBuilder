3
minutes.

Hit
Donate
Now
and
donate
as
much
as
you
want
to.
5)
Depending
on
the
amount
of
your
charitable
donation,
either
write
a
message
with
your
name
to
show
off
how
charitable
you
are
OR
click
anonymous
and/or
hide
your
sponsorship
amount.
6)
Feel
good
and
smug
for
about
30
minutes*
to
enjoy
my
gratitude
(*time
of
feeling
good
and
smug
is
variable).
7)
Add/Tell
other
people
to
do
the
same
(not
the
Facebook
stalking,
they
do
that
anyway)
