The financial outcome of the charity
event Fusion@London has finally be-
come clear. As reported previously in
Felix, there was initially a long, slow,
and confusing period of uncertainty as
to exactly what the situation was. Up
until as recently as 1 May, there were
still invoices that needed to be paid.
However, the loss is now known and
eActivities (the online record of trans-
actions for clubs and societies) cur-
rently gives an accurate representation
of the financial failure of the event. In
total, the event lost £15,506.91.
Fusion@London, founded by Angela
Udemba, who is a PhD student at Im-
perial, is not the first event under the
Fusion name. The concept and first
show was in York in 2005 and Angela
Udemba became the creative director
in 2008, when the show was still at
York. The York events were success-
ful and so she brought the idea to Lon-
don. This year marked the first London
based Fusion event, which were held at
The Troxy in Limehouse on Saturday
25 and Sunday 26 February. The web-
site for the event states that: “At the
heart of Fusion@London is an extrava-
gant annual fashion music and dance
fundraising event”. The aim was to
raise money for the charity Cancer Re-
search UK. The fundraising target was
stated on the website as being £50,000.
A large amount of sponsorship from
various different companies was ac-
quired. The total amount from the
plethora of sources was £8,400. The
main sponsors were Ernst & Young,
with the Gold sponsors being Deutsche
very well. The Halloween
themed Masquerade Ball,
which was held at Café de
Paris and featured 2-4-1 cock-
tails, raffles, and prizes for best
dressed, made nearly £5000. This
was used as the launch party, and
signified the only point when Fusion
was in the black.
As the opening night for the event
drew closer some problems were in-
curred.The Made in Chelsea stars could
not all make both nights. On Saturday,
all three dropped out due to filming
Bank, and smaller companies, retailers,
and clubs being the Silver and Bronze
sponsors.
The nature of the event itself has
been described as a creative amalga-
mation of fashion, music, and dance. It
is a show entirely organised and per-
formed by students primarily from IC
and involves a cast of at least 100 and a
committee of 16-18. It had several mu-
sical headline acts and was supposed
to be presented by three of the stars of
Made in Chelsea – Spencer Matthews,
Hugo Taylor and Binky Felstead.
Much like the loss-making Summer
Ball of 2011, Fusion was jointly held
by institutions, in this case Imperial
College London Union (the Union),
University College London Union
(UCLU), and King’s College London
Union (KCLSU). As stated in the origi-
nal article, neither UCLU nor KCLSU
were financially responsible in any way
for the event. This meant that the only
student union actually risking money
was Imperial College London’s Union,
i.e. the Union. When asked why UCLU
didn’t put any money in for the event,
the reply was that “[UCLU] don’t
believe they [Fusion] asked”. Some
societies from the other Universities
were involved, although they carried
none of the financial burden. UCLU
said that some of their students were
involved and that “Fusion were espe-
cially keen for the involvement of [the]
Dance Society”. However, they had
other commitments and were therefore
unable to commit much to the show,
and the Dance Society didn’t want to
participate in Fusion as an official so-
ciety activity.
Initially, everything was progressing

It was stated
in their contracts that
Fusion could not have them,
or accept an alternative, if they had
filming commitments. Therefore they
were not paid and a replacement, the
musician Sarvi, had to be arranged
through Max Clifford. On Sunday
night Hugo and Spencer turned up and
were subsequently paid.
