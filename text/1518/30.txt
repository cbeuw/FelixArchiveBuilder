Imperial College 1s came back from
the brink in a pulsating final against
Warwick 2s to triumph in the 2012
BUCS Snooker Team Trophy competi-
tion, becoming only the third univer-
sity in recent history to win three titles
on the trot.
Victory also provided the perfect
ending to a glorious career for first
team captain, Hari Arora, who has pot-
ted the winning ball in each of the last
three seasons and is now the club’s
second most decorated player behind
semi-pro, Jonathan Fulcher.
After a strong showing at the Mid-
lands Cup in February, hopes of suc-
cess for the two Imperial teams at this
year’s Championships were high as 36
teams from 20 universities arrived in
Leeds for the season finale.
Such hopes were raised further by a
string of solid performances in the In-
dividual Trophy by the second team.
Most notably, Stanley Cheng was in
top form during his run to the quarter-
finals while old-timer Grace Yip did
well to reach the last 16.
That was in contrast to members of
the first team, the majority of who were
knocked out in the first round of the In-
dividual Championship thanks to some
tough draws and a somewhat conten-
tious decision for Nitesh Mehta to have
a frame docked for arriving “late” to
his match. Only Lawrence Wild pro-
gressed to the second round before los-
ing a very close deciding frame on the
final black.
Fortunes improved for Imperial 1s in
the team event, where the format con-
sisted of two teams of five pairing off
to play 2-frame rubbers in what was

Hat-trick heroes
effectively a best of 10 frames match.
We lost 6-4 to Warwick 1s but re-
sponded with a 5-5 draw against a very
strong Southampton 1s followed by a
9-1 trouncing of Cardiff 2s.
The defeat to Warwick 1s resulted in
them pipping us to second spot in the
group and a Championship quarter final
place, leaving us to once more contest
for the Team Trophy – a tournament we
had won for the previous two years.
Meanwhile Imperial 2s, carried by
captain and frame-winning machine,
Jonathan Hoong, progressed all the
way to the semi-finals of the Team
Plate, where we were unfortunately
overcome by Kent 2s.
The second team’s exit meant it was
down to Imperial 1s to bring home
some silverware.
A comfortable 6-1 victory over Bir-
mingham 1s in the Team Trophy quar-
ter-finals set up a last four clash with
Nottingham 1s, who took us to 5-5 and
a one frame shootout to decide who
would continue on to the final.
Step up former U-19 Romanian
Champion, Bogdan Cozmaciuc, who
played a near-flawless frame, including
a ridiculous run from yellow to blue, to
steer Imperial into yet another Trophy
final.
And so to the final itself, where War-
wick 2s stood between Imperial and
snooker immortality.
Even with a different format for the
...Continued from Back Page

and Clapham Common
final – a race to 3 rubbers in which
each team member contested a best-
of-3 frames rubber against an oppos-
ing team player – we were unfazed
and confident of securing that historic
hat-trick.
However, having lost the first two
rubbers, Imperial 1s then came within
a millimetre of defeat when Warwick’s
Matt Ansell attempted an audacious
double on the black, which ricocheted
off the cushions four times and looked
to be heading for the middle pocket.
Yet the snooker gods were on our
side and the black stopped just short of
the pocket, allowing Bogdan Cozmaci-
uc to reduce the deficit to 2-1.
Our fortunate escape then sparked a
remarkable comeback as Elwin Carlos
came from behind to beat Chee Han
Tan, leaving Captain “Super” Hari-o to
fight it out with his Warwick counter-
part, Mike Williams, for the team gold.
Hari “Potter” easily claimed the first
frame of the rubber before a tense black
ball finish ensued at the end of the sec-
ond.
With a combination of near misses,
terrific safety shots and high drama
that was reminiscent of the 1985 World
Snooker Championship final, breaths
were baited as Hari was eventually
presented with a quarter-ball cut to the
middle with the cue ball just an inch off
the top cushion.
Displaying all the composure that
epitomises his game, Hari coolly rolled
the black in to prompt celebrations of a
truly memorable hat-trick!
Ironically, with that 3-2 victory, Im-
perial join Warwick 2s on the all-time
list of Team Trophy winners with three
titles each, behind only QUB, who
have eight.
Something for us to aim for, surely?!
find that off-putting or inspiring is up
to you.
Now with exam season upon us,
it’s easy to let skating peter out into a
distant memory. However, I can only
urge you to try and keep it up. Spring
offers (or should be offering...) perfect
weather for skating. Not too hot, not
too cold and with the prospect of a
long vacation just around the corner.
So if ever feel like skating/BMXing
post on our Facebook group ‘SB Im-
perial’ and check out our new blog at
imperialsb.tumblr.com. Don’t forget
to keep riding.
