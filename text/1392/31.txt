Virgo
This week you prise
out the mighty
Sword of Felix from
the green couch. It
takes all your might,
golden-ginger
scruffy beard power and stunted growth to
wrench it free from the depths of the back-
of-the-sofa, but you succeed. Confetti pours
over you from the ceiling panels, lens flares
glow and choir boys sing for their high pitch
generating testicles: “Aaaaaaaah!”
Scorpio
Fuck stress relief.
You can all suck
my balls. I’M FINE.
GET OFF MY
FUCKING BACK.
Moron.
...
WHAT?! I’m just trying to play Mario in
peace. I don’t give a flying fuck if there’s
cockroaches in the bathroom. WHAT?! How
stupid do you think I am? Of course I didn’t
leave the bin full of rotting squid for a week.
Libra
OI! Yeah, yeah you.
I saw you looking. I
don’t care if you’re
wielding a broad-
sword. Come over
here and stare at
me like that. Yeah, that’s right – I’m getting
all up in your grill. Fucking what? YEAH?!
Your mum. No, YOUR MUM. Ha, don’t cash
cheques yo’ ass’ can’ handle bro-thing. Boosh.
Sagittarius
anger: noun [U]. A
strong feeling which
makes you want to
hurt someone or be
unpleasant because
of something unfair
or hurtful that has happened:
I think he feels a lot of anger towards his father
who treated him very badly as a child.
There is a danger that anger at the new law
may turn into anti-government feeling.
When you kick someone in the chunt.
Capricorn
And breathe...
...
...
...
No, you’re
hyperventilating!
No! Here, take this brown bag! SOMEONE
DIAL 999! QUICK!
...
Beep, Beep, Beep, Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...
Cancer
Yeah, thanks, you’re
a real good friend.
Thanks, I knew I
could rely on you.
Nah, don’t worry
about it. Every-
thing’s going to be A-Ok. LOOK. I’M FINE.
GET OFF MY CASE NOW. You stupid over-
protective little bint. It’s always “Me, me, me.”
with you, isn’t it?
Gemini
Counselling? You
what? Oh please do
come in: just take
a seat there on my
‘chair-long’. You
what? You mean
‘chez-long’ don’t you, really? No one else in
their right mind calls a ‘chez-long’ a ‘chair-
long.’ So kind of attempt at humour? Er...
Listen, I’ll humour you when I feel like. Now
shut the hell up, sit me down and show me
black and white pictures of womens’ mix-up.
Leo
This week you’re
on the end of be-
ing kicked up the
chunt. Your friends
kneel down to aid
you, shortly before
a ninja squirrel bounds down from his perch
on a nearby tree, decapitating each and every
one of them leaving blood spurting corpses
sprawled across the park. You got off lightly
but won’t be so lucky next time. Your days are
numbered and I’m the Calculator of Doom.
Taurus
This week you go to
angry-camp. Here
they show you the
meaning of “The
Good AIDs”, what
it’s like to stroke
bunnies and how to eat doughnuts without
licking your lips. Unfortunately, you’re caught
with your hands in your downstairs mix-up
beating out an angry wank and you’re expelled
instantly. Mummy’s not there to pick you up
either and on the way home a cougar eats you.
Aries
vent (EXPRESS
FEELINGS) verb
[T]. To express a
negative emotion in
a forceful and often
unfair way:
Please don’t shout – there’s no need to vent
your frustration/anger/rage/spleen on me.
Please don’t! PLEASE! I’m so young! I haven’t
lived yet, let alone been through puberty!
Pisces
What the fuck is
this emo bullshit
in the horoscope
above?! Jesus. Get a
hold of yourself you
self-loathing prick.
Being miserable for yourself never helped any-
one. MAN UP. Once you’ve done that, head
to a motorway and try stopping an articulated
lorry with your bear (intentional) hands. Then
we can rejoice and laugh at the sorry mess ly-
ing in the tarmac.

Wordoku is identical to sudoku;
we’ve just replaced the numbers
with letters. Once you’ve
completed the puzzle, there
is a hidden word or phrase to
find. Email in your answers to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
The winner of Wordoku
1,391 was Sofia Vatti. She
knew the hidden word was
“PRODUCING”.

This week you get
an early night. Early
by World Record
standards anyway.
Surely this should
gear you up for the
next day’s work, but in fact you end up being
a right grumpy bastard. You tell someone to
“shut the fuck up”, you ignore other people and
you generally become a bit short with people.
The bath at home never sounded so welcom-
ing. Mmmm...

How to play:
Surely you know how to play
this by now? Ok I don’t ei-
ther, but here’s a pared down
version of the instructions.
Crudely speaking, Slith-
erlink is similar to Mine-
sweeper mixed with a dash
of Sudoku.
The object of the game is
to draw lines between the
dots to create one long, and
most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start
or finish; just like an elastic
band.
Each number indicates
how many lines should be
drawn around it. Cells which
don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any
number of lines.
Remember, the line must
form a loop, so the line can-
not branch.
Squares are not allowed
either. There are never cells
containing the number 4 in
Slitherlink.
So, where do you start?
The most common place to
start on a Slitherlink grid is
by drawing crosses around
any zeros. Drawing crosses
is purely done to so that you
know where there can’t pos-
sibly be a line.
The internet’s a good bet
for tips and tricks if you’re
stuck.
