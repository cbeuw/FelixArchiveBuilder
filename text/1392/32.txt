T
he first long trip of the
year and we decided
to go to Cwmcarn in
South Wales. I know,
why would anyone
want to go to Wales?!? Well, there
is some of the best riding in the UK
there and it is only just over 3 hours
drive from London. Cwmcarn is the
only place with its own uplift serv-
ice on the downhill track running
5 days-a-week and that means you
can get about 14 runs in without
having to push up a single metre.
The cross-country circuit is 15km
of pure single track and although
that doesn’t sound like much, every
metre is technically challenging. As
for road riding, Brecon Forest is just
round the corner with miles of open
empty tarmac.
Being a Friday night I wanted to
get out of London before the traf-
fic started to build up, so I thought
by 5pm everyone’s classes should be
finished and we can pack the van,
put the bikes on the trailer and be
gone by 5:30. HA! Life is never that
simple. Having failed to book the
minivan with a loading space, we
were left with a 15 seater minivan
with a tow bar. Fine, I thought, we
can take more people and just use
the Club’s bike trailer. But at 4:30 I
find out that the only minivan that
you can tow with is also the only
one with a huge loading space in
the back, which negates the need
for towing. But the 15-seater has a
tow bar!! Yes, but you can’t use it
because that would be against the
law. So the only solution was to put
the bikes on the roof which is not an
easy task when you have silly cross
-country bikes made out of flapping
carbon fibre and road bikes which
are made out of such thin tubing
that they are almost transparent.
Having left Imperial at 6:30 the
traffic was horrendous and it took
us two hours just to get out of Lon-
don not including a stop in Ham-
mersmith to pick up James “Can-
nonball” Coakley who was confused
and astounded by the fact that TFL
wouldn’t let him take a huge down-
hill bike on the Tube at rush hour!
Thankfully it only took us two and
a bit hours once we were past the
M25 and we got there by 11pm.
The Riding Centre is very
well organised and has
a Visitors Centre
and Camp
Site at
the
bottom of the downhill track which
is also where the cross-country starts.
Oh yes, forgot to mention that we were
camping, in Wales, in mid Novem-
ber, in a valley. But it wasn’t that bad,
for me anyway, because as crazy as it
sounds, I’ve done this several times
and I brought my skiing jacket with
me. The wind gusting down the valley
was so strong that it took us several at-
tempts to put up the 10 man tent and
in the end we had to park the minivan
in front to shelter us from the wind
so that the skinny freshers didn’t get
swept up into the heavens.
Once the tent was up, the rest was
plain sailing and we eventually man-
aged to get some sleep. Well except for
Jason “Monster T” Vicente and Pambo
“Nutter” Palas, who being Portuguese,
thought that camping was warm and
comfortable everywhere and decided
that they would only need a 2-season
sleeping bag and no ground mat…
Rising at the crack of dawn, we all put
our bikes together and prepared our-
selves for a full day of Welsh riding.
The cross-country route was tack-
led by “Flappy-carbon” Dave and
“Squeaky- brake” Allan.
Known in the Mountain Biking com-
munity as a top-class Trail Centre, it
features some of the best single-track
in the country. The route starts off with
a short climb to warm up, with plenty
of technical sections shortly leading on
to yet more climbing in order to reach
the top of the hill. The newly opened
free-ride area provided a chance to try
out some drops and jumps before a fast
descent. After another short climb, the
trail emerges from the forest on the
edge of the hill to provide views across
the valley. Another long, fast and tech-
nical decent ended the route back at
the car park. It’s a lot longer that it
sounds.
Realising we had completed the loop
in a record fast time of 1:15, we were
ready for another lap to see if we could
beat that. Reaching the top of the hill,
it felt like a slower lap from how
tired we were this time, but
on reaching the end
we set a new
time of
1:08,
even after Allan’s fall practising
on the downhill track between
laps, providing a spectacle for a
line of downhill bikers waiting
for the uplift truck.
The Lycra-clad gang, whilst
embarrassing as they are, also
got in some good riding.
What better way to over-
come a biting wind on an
overcast day than to get out
on the open road in the roll-
ing hills of a National Park
and get those adrenaline
and endorphin levels up?
Having bolted down a makeshift
breakfast, four of us (Basti, Wesley, Ja-
son & Javed) left Cwmcarn for Brecon.
With a great spread in levels of expe-
rience, we did well to stick together
as a group until one long climb when
we made the decision to split up and
meet back together later. Jason headed
for a pub (we think) and Basti, Wesley
and Javed headed off to do a 20-mile
loop through the National Park. One
particular section will stick long in the
memory, a long, windy road through
rolling hills, which thankfully the Top
Gear team weren’t using for a supercar
shoot that day.
After a stop at a well-to-do pub for
a refuel we rejoined Jason, although
meeting at a roundabout wasn’t a
great idea as we were waiting at differ-
ent roundabouts for ages! Another 20
miles on the A-roads had us back in
Cwmcarn ready for more food and a
hot shower and reminiscing about the
National Park loop.
As for the Downhill lot, London may
be cold, the Arctic colder, but Wales
was something else... the wind of the
previous night cut through
to our bones... much
the same way as
the ground
did the
following day –
lacking copious amounts of
alcohol to ease the pain.
Not used to riding in the UK, it was
quite daunting for some of us to ride
down a track about as wide as our
shoulders with what looked like a never
ending cliff to our right. Falling would
result in rolling down a mountain un-
til you hit a tree... which you hope to
God would happen sooner rather than
later.
With this thought in mind, we de-
cided to launch ourselves off the high-
est peak we could drive up to and try
to reach the bottom intact. For the
majority of us this worked out fine.
James “Cannonball” Coakley, however
decided it would be appropriate to
please the crowd and try new tricks in
what is probably the fastest and hence
worst place to do so, resulting in some
serious damage to both ma and
machine. Luckily
he was able to limp away leaving
just his ego on the floor behind
him. As for his bike it needed to go
to A&E.
After the first run, and having
seen our lives flash before our eyes,
all that was left was to get back in
the van and go at it again but FAST-
ER, trying many different tracks-
some more pleasant and less painful
than others. All in all, the diversity
of the tracks, the great group, and
the warm hand-dryer in the bath-
room made the trip a really kick-ass
experience.
Having had a good day’s riding by
all we packed up and made our way
back to London at an electronically
limited 62mph in the minivan.
