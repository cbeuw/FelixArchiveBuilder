Fat contains more calories than any
other food source, making it very easy
for us to consume too many calories
from fat, which can over time contrib-
ute to weight problems. There are vari-
ous types of fat, not all of them are bad.
The three most important types are
saturated fat, poly-unsaturated fat and
mono-unsaturated fat.
Saturated fats are the worst and
increase health risks if too much is
consumed over a long period of time.
Most children and adults in Britain are
eating too much saturated fat. They
are found in foods like full-fat dairy
products such as cheese, butter, full-fat
milk and yoghurt. Fatty red meat such
as sausages, salami and luncheon meat
alongside processed and fried food
such as pies, pastries, pizzas, takeaways
and snacks like crisps and confection-
ary, all contain saturated fat.
Also be aware of trans-fats, these
behave like saturated fats and aren’t
always listed on food labels but they
are mostly found in foods containing
hydrogenated oils used in processed
foods like pies, pastries, biscuits and
other snacks.
Poly-unsaturated fats have been
shown to lower blood cholesterol levels
and therefore help in reducing the risk
of heart disease. Omega 3 and Omega
6 are essential fatty acids and as our
bodies cannot manufacture them, we
must consume them in our diets. You
can find these in foods such as oily fish
like mackerel, salmon, trout, herring,
sardines as well as in sunflower, corn
and soya bean oils, seeds, nuts – wal-
nuts, almonds, and soft poly-unsatu-
rated spreads are also good sources.
Mono-unsaturated fats help to lower
total blood cholesterol and can help
to prevent certain cancers and heart
disease. These are found in olive oil
and rapeseed oil (containing Omega
9), nuts – peanuts, avocados and soft
margarine spreads.
The current recommendation is that
we should take in no more than 33% of
our total calories from fat. Saturated
fat should account for no more than
10% of our total calorie intake because
of its harmful effects on our health.
The rest of the calories from fat should
come from mono-unsaturated or po-
ly-unsaturated fats because these are
more beneficial to health.
If you read through the list of satu-
rated fats and are feeling slightly bad as
over the Christmas holidays you have
consumed all if not half of the types of
food listed, then don’t worry…. to start
the New Year off try reducing the type
of fats you eat by replacing the bad fats
with the good fats. If you cut down on
just some of these you’ll not only lower
your cholesterol level you might even
lose some of the weight you may have
put on over Christmas too!
Some tips to help reduce the fat in
your diet are as follows; use semi-
skimmed or skimmed milk instead of
full-fat milk , switch to a low-fat spread
instead of butter or margarine; eat
more chicken and fish and less red or
fatty meats, choose lean cuts of meat
and trim off all the excess fat; grill,
bake, steam or microwave food rather
than frying it; try low-fat varieties of
dairy products such as cheese and yo-
ghurt. Choose poly-unsaturated cook-
ing oils or mono-unsaturated olive oil,
avoid high-fat snacks such as crisps,
biscuits, cakes and pastries, try to limit
takeaway to once a week or less and fi-
nally look for the word ‘hydrogenated’
on food labels and try to limit these
foods.

On your marks...
You’ve probably heard the old saying
“fail to prepare and prepare to fail”.
Well this applies to a lot of areas from
your group presentation for univer-
sity through to the tactics you might
use playing a rival team and this say-
ing especially applies to the topic of
this article - warm-up, cool-down and
stretching.
So its January the swimming pool’s
heaving full of people, parks are packed
with runners and the gym’s busier than
the bar on ACC night, what do you do
first?
The first thing should be to get on a
C.V. (cardiovascular) machine to raise
your body temperature and heart rate
steadily for between 5-10 minutes e.g.
a treadmill, bike, rower, cross-trainer
etc (you get the idea). Usually at some
point in the warm-up you might see
some people do some static stretches.
These should be saved for after the
cool-down at the end of the workout,
as static stretching before exercise has
been shown in numerous studies not
to have an effect on injury prevention
when done in the warm-up and can
decrease power production.
What has been shown to be much
more effective is a movement specific
warm-up otherwise called ‘dynamic
stretching’. Before we go any further,
this is not where we get our leg warm-
ers out and bounce about with flailing
limbs everywhere looking like we’ve
been electrocuted. These are control-
led movements to develop our range
of movement so that the body will be
in an optimal state to start exercising.
I recommend you do between 6-8 rep-
etitions of each dynamic stretch. Some
examples are explained below;
A bodyweight squat works on your
hip and lower body muscles. Bent
knee forward bends work on hip and
hamstring muscles. Arm circles work
out the upper body and shoulder mus-
cles, finally exaggerated clap with arms
work on the upper body muscles.
With that all done, you are ready to
go into the main part of your workout
but what happens when you’re finish-
ing up? Well the cool-down should
take between 5-10 minutes on a cardi-
ovascular machine with the emphasis

on taking the heart rate and body tem-
perature down. This can be done by
gradually decreasing the speed/resist-
ance of the machine as you get to the
end of your workout giving the body an
opportunity to get rid of waste prod-
ucts it produces during the session.
So onto stretching - this part is cru-
cial for targeting any tight areas of your
body and to increase the rate of your
recovery (so you don’t feel like you’ve
been run over by a truck the next
morning). Hold the stretch for any-
where between 20-60 seconds (the less
flexible you are in that area the longer
you hold it), make sure you breathe
and as the time goes by relax into the
stretch more but don’t force it (a good
guide is if your face has a screwed up
constipated look, then you’re forcing
the stretch). Pay attention when you
get into the stretch that both sides of
your body feel an equal stretch- espe-
cially if you are stretching one side at
a time. If one side does feel less flex-
ible, spend more time on that side to
gain an equal amount of flexibility and
therefore balance.
If you’re unsure how or what dynamic
or static stretches to do, please ask one
of the instructors in the Ethos gym.
One for the ladies!
