Macworld: Join the Cloud
James Finnerty reports on Apples new releases and what they’ll do for you
They made the MacBook thinner... doesn’t this just encourage our society’s obsessions with losing weight? Only joking; it’s pretty cool though
A
t 5pm on Tuesday night
Steve Jobs kicked off his
keynote speech at this
year’s Macworld. Peo-
ple have been expecting
a lot from the wealth of rumours and
hype that has been floating around
and he's not one to disappoint. His last
big announcement was the iPhone and
iTouch, so let’s see whether or not he’s
stepped up to his own marker.
The new line of Mac laptops were
announced, dubbed ‘Air’. They fall be-
tween the existing MacBook and Mac-
Book Pro lines; their forefront feature
is its unbelievably thin form factor
(19.3mm to 4.1mm) and its light weight
of 1.36 kilograms. It also has a respect-
able battery life of five hours and the
option of being provided with a solid
state hard disk. With such a small case
there will always be a compromise, and
the Air is no exception. There is no op-
tical drive, no wired LAN ports only
wireless, only a single USB 2.0 and the
battery is not user-replaceable. A new
external Apple Superdrive (DVD read-
er/writer) will be available for when
you want to use discs in your Air, but
since there is only one USB port you
will have to remove whatever other de-
vice you are using at the time, which
could become more than annoying.
The trackpad features improved multi-
touch, so it can function in ways more
similar to the iPhone, than its more
basic existing counterparts. The asking
price for these puppies is a whopping
$1,800 dollars, which is a lot consider-
ing ultimately it has less features than a
MacBook Pro- we should see them in
the region of £1,200-£1,500, whenever
they become available on our side of
the Pond.
LED backlights have also been intro-
duced on the new Macbook. Now what
does this mean for you? Well they use
less power so you get more battery, less
space so thinner screens, they turn on
instantly so no waiting and they also
provide a brighter and more uniform
image for your viewing pleasure. I
wonder when Apple will get OLED’s?
Another step has been taken into
solid state disk products by Apple as
you can order one as an option inside
your Air. It’s not as clear-cut as this
though: this adds a ridiculous $1,300 to
the price tag, as well as losing 14GB of
disk space but it does offer prolonged
battery life and reduced boot times.
Whether users will feel this justifies the
cost is yet to be revealed, but I think
you can assume they probably won’t.
One question that is looming in my
mind over a thinner MacBook is the
fact that existing models suffer from
numerous overheating related prob-
lems. Surely this type of problem will
only be made worse by a thinner hous-
ing but we will have to wait until they
hit the market before we can get any
facts and figures that dispell or validate
these worries.
Apple TV has also been revamped
to feature HD functionality as well
as 5.1 Sound and you will be able to
download most existing content in
HD for only 20% more than Standard
Definition. Apple hopes this update
will bring the popularity of this line of
products up to a level more on par with
some of its other products. To aid this,
the existing of edition of Apple TV is
receiving a healthy price cut. Apple TV
is serviced entirely online and doesn’t
use an aerial or anything like that, so
it’s not a US-only product. You can get
them over here but as mentioned pre-
viously, they are not massively popular
and therefore are not so well stocked.
iTunes has been updated to allow
movie rentals. The user pays a differ-
ent price based on the age of the film
and whether or not it is in SD or HD.
The dollar prices are reasonable but
we'll see how these translate over here.
This service is intended to be up and
running by next month and by the end
of February, Jobs claims it will have a
database of over one thousand films.
Providing this service will hopefully
entice many people who do not use
iTunes to start to. It really applies a
fantastic alternative to going out and
renting films, it’s cheaper and there is
more on offer without having to re-
member to take the damn things back.
The real question is whether or not
this will deter people from download-
ing illegal copies of films?
Also the Time Capsule has been an-
nounced. It's an extension of Apple's
Airport extreme product, which is
more or less a wireless router but with
some associated Mac friendly good-
ies. The Time Capsule also includes a
'server grade' hard-disk which when
combined with OS X Leopard’s allows
for automatic remote backups by the
hour. It also still includes all the Air-
port's features such as being able to
host a wireless printer. A 500GB ver-
sion and 1TB version are planned and
this product may start to become more
of a must-have for the existing Mac
user.
A smaller release is a set of five ap-
plications for the new(ish) iPod Touch.
These applications all exist on the
iPhone but use the device’s free mo-
bile Internet package to function. The
Touch versions will be modified to suit
the fact the device will have intermit-
tent WiFi Internet connectivity. Includ-
ed are Mail, Maps, Stocks, Weather,
and Notes which can be downloaded
for a small $20 fee, but we will have to
wait and see how many people are will-
ing to front more cash towards their
relatively new iTouch.
Don't go thinking the iPhone hasn't
seen anything new, it has, but it’s quite
a minor update compared to the other
new stuff. Most of its built-in applica-
tions have had updates and new fea-
tures added to make them more func-
tional, for example, video playback
has been enhanced. The iPhone was

might run this every week if
people think it’s a good idea.
Basically this will be a little col-
umn tucked away at the side
that contains a set of hidelines
that we thought you might like to read
about but didn’t want to have to write
articles for. A quick search on a well
known internet seach engine should
churn up some interesting articles on
each of them.
also celebrating its four millionth sale,
however Apple had hoped for over five
million by this time. Still, 20,000 sales
a day is amazing for a first generation
device for a manufacturer’s first step
into a new market. Even though this
device has been very slow to come into
the UK market, it’s already secured a
foot hold and doesn’t seem to be slow-
ing down. It would be very nice to
see Apple come out with some more
phone models.
Unfortunately no updates were re-
leased for the existing MacBook lines
to keep them cutting edge, which is a
bit of a shame as the feature set is start-
ing to become a little stagnated. Hint:
get multi-touch pads put in the older
MacBooks. I think we can let Steve and
his friends off on this one, but just this
once.
So to conclude, it appears that Apple
has decided not to pull its army back
and wants to drive forward to take even
more market sector away from any
other company thats dares to compete.
They have produced new hardware,
software and services which should
secure their front running position for
at least another year, leaving us to look
forward to next year’s Macworld.
