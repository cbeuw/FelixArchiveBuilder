Union’s Higher Education
survey announced
Matty Hoban
Take next Friday’s online Higher Education survey and you can
influence what the Union’s stance on funding should be
Last term, Imperial College Union
Council voted to review its policy of
campaigning for free education, by
consulting the student body. Since
then, Union President Stephen Brown
and Deputy President (Education &
Welfare) Kirsty Patterson have been
preparing a survey for students that
will be launched on the 25th January at
lunchtime.
The survey aims to gauge opinion on
higher education funding as a whole
rather than current government policy
specifically. Felix has obtained an early
draft of the questionnaire and its struc-
ture asks general questions about the
role of higher education before get-
ting onto questions of funding. This
will help direct Union policy on higher
education funding.
With constant discussion over top-
up fees and the effect it will have on
the higher education sector, the Un-
ion believes that their current policy is
“unrealistic”. So how did funding end
up at the current situation?
In July 1997, the Dearing Report on
higher education assessed that free
education was not viable and sug-
gested a contribution from the student
of £1,000 instead. At the time of the
report, tuition was free and students
had access to equal grants and loans.
This £1,000 would be paid after gradu-
ation, i.e: a graduate tax. However, the
government did not introduce the rec-
ommendations of the Dearing Report,
instead favouring a loan system and
charging £1,000 in tuition fees. This
system was amended for the academic
year 2006/7 introducing the infamous
top-up fees.
The introduction of top-up fees
(capped at £3,000) has not been seen
as an adequate solution by some. The
Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, has been
an advocate of higher top-up fees in
the past alongside greater bursaries.
Amongst all this debate, in 2009 the
cap on the top-up fees will be reviewed
by a government board. By the time
the report has drawn its conclusions,
the Union is hoping to have a policy
with which to stand by.
In the next couple of weeks, Felix and
the Union are encouraging debate over
the current funding model, proposals
of new models and a detailed explana-
tion of how we got to where we are.
This will all lead up to the aforemen-
tioned survey going live on the day that
Felix is out.
The following debates and the sur-
vey will deal with issues such as the
purpose of education, whether it be a
means for employment or it existing
for its own sake; also, larger political
issues such as social mobility will be
opened up for even greater discussion.
Student involvement is necessary to
present a clear and cohesive policy, so
get involved next Friday and have your
say in the funding debate.
Here’s what’s at stake in the Higher Education Funding debate
Why do we need a Higher
Education Funding debate?
Kirsty Patterson
Imperial College Union Deputy
President (Education & Welfare)
Spending a fair majority of time over
the last three years dabbling in Student
politics it hasn’t been a particularly du-
bious task to deduce one thing about
students in general: there is nothing in
general that unifies students on politi-
cal issues. Representing the views of a
‘movement’ of students can at times
be exactly as changeable as it sounds.
With such a dynamic political agenda
from year to year a debate involving the
NUS and the Government would draw
close parallels to a trolley race where
we are pitting four broken wheels go-
ing in different directions against jet
propulsion. I certainly wouldn’t be
putting money on the broken trolley.
The next big trolley race is peeking
over the horizon. After the introduc-
tion of top-up fees in October 2006
a review of the £3000 cap is due in
2009. By my estimate that gives us just
enough time to fix the broken trolley
wheels and decide which way they are
going to be pointing.
In the second meeting of Union
Council in the 2006/2007 period a
policy was passed which outlined the
Imperial College Union stance on Tui-
tion Fees. It was passed at a Council
before any Ordinary Members had
been elected which is not the most
democratic of bodies.
Sincethepolicywaswrittenanumber
of key positions in the Higher Educa-
tion debate have shifted. The NUS is no
longer running a campaign to fight for
free education for all, instead choosing
to concentrate on keeping the cap in
place; the Rector of Imperial College
London has changed his stance on un-
regulated fees instead favouring rais-
ing the cap by a much smaller amount
than he originally stated; and that ten
years on from the Dearing Report the
measures put in place to address the
dying Higher Education system have
not had the predicted effect of restrict-
ing access for students from poor so-
cio-economic backgrounds.
The need for a full debate on Higher
Education funding stems from these
political shifts and the availability of
more information than we had a year
ago. With key debates in the NUS oc-
curring in the near future and the
deadline for amendments to NUS Con-
ference at the end of February, Council
decided that a full review of our cur-
rent policy should take place.
The survey will be open to all stu-
dents of Imperial College to allow the
student population as a whole to get
involved rather than a few student
members of Council. Also, the ques-
tions will be supported by all the avail-
able facts on funding, bursaries and
possible solutions printed in Felix over
the coming weeks to help you come to
an informed decision.
Once we have gathered your opinions
all that is left to do is align the trolley
wheels in the right direction and start
the mad dash to the finish line.
The survey is open to all IC students, not just Union Councillors
