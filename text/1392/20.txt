The longest fad in history

All Stars are the long standing heavy-
weights of footwear fashion, and they
show no sign of changing.
‘Chucks’ were not initially designed
to be the worldwide phenomenon they
appear to be today. They were intend-
ed to be basketball shoes in 1917, but
ironically, were not popular upon re-
lease. It took a young basketball player
from Chicago to revamp and launch
their amazing climb to
Daniel Wan tells the story of a basketball player who left a legacy
worldwide popularity All Stars now re-
ceive. The man himself, Chuck Taylor,
was a basketball player, but was never
a legend in the game. During a mod-
erately successful sporting career, he
took up employment with Converse
Chicago to stamp his ideas and con-
cepts to update the look and use of
All Stars. Within two years, Converse
were so impressed with his work that
they commissioned the official prod-
uct name as ‘Chuck Taylor All Stars’.
Nearly a century later, over
270,000,000 pairs and counting have
been sold across the globe; undisput-
ingly making them the single most suc-
cessful brand of shoes ever. Why have
they become such an iconic figure in
Western cultures past and present?
With the basis of Chuck Taylor’s
tireless promotion and marketing
across America during the 1920s
and 30s, Converse have gone
from strength to strength in
selling the All Star to de-
mographics away from
its basketball roots.

Leather Briefcases
We’re not talking about the
hard black briefcases your
dad took to work in the early
90s, but the softer traditional
brown leather briefcases. Look
less like a stockmarket trader,
and more like a gentleman.
These will add a finishing
touch to men’s new smart and
slick look this year.
How ethical is your
wardrobe?
Head over to the world’s fa-
vourite time-waster, YouTube,
and search for the first epi-
sode of this online series, as
titled above. It puts forward
a point, but the whole thing
just stinks of blandess. The
camera, the clothes, and most
worringly, the facts.
Topshop.co.uk Waif
Despite owner Phillip Green
promising a ban on painfully
thin models being used as
models for Topshop, there
is nothing but the contrary
slapped across Topshop.co.uk.
Being one of the biggest
teenage fashion outlets in the
UK, Topshop needs to take a
great deal of responsibility in
how they advertise to their
demographic. I cannot help
but think how many insecure
teenagers have been made a
little bit more insecure as they
log on for a quick online shop.
COOL
LAME
M
ini Skirts and
me? Not a
chance.
With
spring
upon us comes the hike
of hemlines. But not me;
I’m sticking to decency,
thank you. Designers are
all putting skirts the size of
handkerchiefs on manne-
quins in their windows and
women are flocking to stores,
clawing for a kitchen-towel
sized wrap-around. It’s all
right for those who have legs
up to their chests, tanned,
toned and perfectly waxed.
But what about the aver-
age woman? With shorter
hemlines come a myriad of
problems that the design-
ers don’t seem to think af-
fect us. Firstly, having to wear
shorter skirts means having to
show off your legs. Fair enough
that designers have given us
enough warning, there still
is time to get into shape be-
fore spring is actually upon us,
but isn’t that another task to
add onto our already long list?
And what about those of us who were
born with fat, unshapely legs, and just
can’t do anything about them? With
shorter skirts come psycho-
logical issues that women
have to battle. Swallowing
their pride and abandon-
ing all sense of rationality,
many still choose to wear
micro-minis, with the dis-
astrous result of stopping
traffic; for all the wrong
reasons.
Besides the eyesores
that these offend-
ing pieces of mate-
rial sometimes create,
many women are also
putting themselves
at risk by being dedi-
cated followers of this
particularly disrepu-
table fashion. Shorter
skirts invite a cacoph-
ony of catcalls and wolf
whistles as a woman
walks down the street for
her morning coffee, and
in extreme situations this
could lead to sexual harass-
ment and other situations
involving testoster-
one-charged males.
Although you may
side with Eve Ensler (author
of the immortal ‘The Vagina Mono-
logues’) when she says, "my short skirt
is not an invitation, provocation, or in-
were inundated with
different styles of
Chucks; suede,
leather, vinyl,
low-top and
high-top,
and eventu-
ally it caught
on in a big
way. This fad
was one that
would never
really die out.
The All Star
brand, largely syn-
onymous with bas-
ketball, made an eventual
amazing shift towards the music sub-
culture.Duringthe1970s,theRamones
epitomized the popularity of Chucks in
America by using scruffy plain black
hi-top Chucks as part of their trade-
mark image. Across the pond, the Sex
Pistols flew the flag for Chucks, albeit
with less popularity amongst fans. Old-
school trends owe a lot to All Star’s
perseverant resurges into the main-
stream casual footwear market. Dur-
ing the late Eighties and early Nineties,
the grunge scene allowed Chucks to
once again climb the scales of sub-
culture fashion. Nirvana, yet
another truly iconic
band, featured
All Stars in
many of
their photo
shoots.
Today,
in 2008,
the world’s
beloved Chucks are now of-
ficially products of Nike,
after the 2001 takeover
of Converse. Bank-
ruptcy forced Con-
verse to sell over, and
in some eyes ‘out’, to
the major sports-
wear conglomerate.
Still marketed un-
der the classic Con-
verse brand, a distinct
sour taste has been
left in the more ethical
of mouths. Nike’s associa-
tions with child labour in Asia
have now bled over to the Converse
brand, to the displeasure of treasurers
of Converse’s previous history and val-
ues. Despite this, sales of Chucks are
successful as ever, with an extended
range of prints, materials, cuts and
customizable options available to to-
day’s ever-demanding consumer. Gone
are Chucks’ heady days of punk rock
and grunge; they now belong in the
mainstream of global fashion and cul-
ture. Hollywood films such as I, Robot
and Sin City continue to provide mass
exposure through heavy (if not annoy-
ingly blatant) product-placement.
Every new year All Stars are on the
out, according to fashion experts, but
it’s like saying you’ll get bored of your
favourite film. You never will, other-
wise it wouldn’t be your favourite film.
All Stars are simply the Pulp Fictions,
and the Shawshank Redemptions of
fashion. Epitomized in two words;
eternal style.
I bet Des Lynam wears them too.
dication that I want
it, give it, or hook."
I beg to differ. Fe-
males and males
exist interdepend-
ently and, as we are
all acutely aware,
(fromcountlessBen
and Jerry’s nights)
men are definitely
the more fallible sex.
Although I’m not ad-
vocating that women
go around in purdahs,
I am also not saying
that rapists should
use short skirts as the
new alcohol. What
I’m trying to say is
that women have a
responsibility for the
signals they send to
men. The Home Of-
fice suggests that in
the past year, a total of
the various reported
offences of rape
was 13,322. Come
hopefully warmer
weather, are these
numbers going to rise? If they do, are
we to blame?
Don’t shorter skirts represent a more
buoyant economy? According to one
theory, if skirts are short, the markets
Thoughts of the thinking woman
Nada Jumabhoy enjoys walking down the street without the catcalls
are going up. And if skirts
are long, the markets are
heading down. Hmm…I
don’t think so. The idea
behind this is that shorter
skirts tend to appear in times
when consumer confidence is
high, meaning the markets are
bullish. In contrast, long skirts are
worn more in times of depression,
indicating that things are bearish.
To the modern, rational reader
I ask incredulously, do you actu-
ally believe this? If so, why not
wear no skirt at all; surely that
would mean our economy is
booming. I shake my head in
disbelief, and before I am ac-
cused of masquerading as a
misogynist, I say this: pussy
pelmets should by no means
be a substitute for logical
thinking.
With a lot more than
meets the eye (irony in-
tended), short skirts have
a ubiquitous and far-
reaching effect, even if
the furthest down they
reach is your bum. This
writer intends to be
fash- ionable yet not ridicu-
lous, dressing modestly and elegantly.
This is one situation where the adage
“less is more” does not apply.
