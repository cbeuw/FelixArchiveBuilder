Some of the more astute of you will
have noticed that tickets for Summer
Ball 2008 are now on sale, despite the
event being a whole five months away.
On June 21st over 3000 students, staff
and alumni will take part in the largest
student ball in London. Last year’s event,
held in conjunction with the College
Centenary, saw the greatest all Imperial
has seen. This year, things are going to
be even bigger and better, whilst freezing
last year’s ticket prices, meaning even
better value-for-money.
The evening will start with a champagne
reception and a four course dinner with
a number of distinguished guests. Due
to massive demand last year, we have
increased the number of dinner tickets;
however these are still bound to sell out
early, so get them early! After the dinner,
the Summer Ball will continue long into
the night with music and entertainment
from some household names bringing
joy across the whole of the South Ken
campus.
Last year we had DJ sets from Alex Zane
and Alexa Chung from T4’s Popworld,
alongside Emma Griffiths from MTV
and Andy Rourke from XFM. Those
who attended last year may have also
witnessed X-Factor finalists Ben Mills
and Eton Road with Scouting for Girls
in the Great Hall whilst the Union
played host to drum and bass legends
Pendulum. This year expect the acts to
be bigger and better, however the night
is not just about the music and we’ll have
some spectacular fireworks, a funfair,
casino and plenty more surprises that we
have in store.
If you’re not done by 4am then there
will be an after party continuing in the
Union, and the bars will remain open
until closing on Sunday night. Last year
many plucky/foolish revellers (which
included the Union President in his kilt)
managed to fulfil the challenge of staying
in the Union until 11pm after a massive
30 hours of partying.
The Summer Ball is a great event,
whether you’re graduating or continuing
next year, finished with exams or only
just beginning (stress relief you see),
hardcore waster or teetotaller; we try
to give everyone
a fantastic night.
Remember we’re
always open to
suggestions, so if
you have any ideas
or questions please
give me an email at
dpfs@imperial.ac.uk
Keep an eye out for
more for our line-
up announcements
which will be
released at
the beginning of next term. Also,
be sure to get your tickets from the
imperialcollegeunion.org before the
March 19 so you get your special
advance ticket prices!
National Student Survey
First of all I would like to apologise to
those of you who are not final year
undergraduates as this information will
not really apply to you. The National
Student Survey is an opportunity for
all final year students studying at UK
universities to give their opinion on their
time at university. The survey contains
questions on all aspects of your student
experience and will cover issues such
as assessment and feedback, learning
resources, teaching and whether or not
you felt satisfied with your experience
of Imperial College London. All final
year students will be contacted asking
them to complete this survey and I
urge you to do so as it is a very useful
tool for highlighting anything you have
been unhappy with so that the College
has to take action to improve things
for continuing and future students. The
results of this survey are very important
as they will go a long way to directing
the work of College and your Union’s
academic representatives in 2008/09 so
please take the few minutes required to
fill it in.
NUS Regional Conference
More info about my favourite student
collective! The next meeting of Regional
Conference for NUS London will take
place on Wednesday 30 January at City
& Islington College. Imperial College
Union is entitled to send another 8
delegates so if you would like to come
along please drop me an email at
president@imperial.ac.uk. Topics for
discussion include Higher Education
Funding, the NUS governance review
and you will also get the chance to wreck
up the elected NUS sabbaticals for things
that they have (or have not) done.
Graduate Students’
Association Elections –
Nominations now open
Nominations for the positions of GSA
Chair, Treasurer and Secretary are now
open. A member of staff has been
recruited by the Union to support the
work of postgraduate representatives
and the Faculty Union’s so those of
you who are elected to these positions
can expect a great deal of help and
support as you help direct and organise
academic representation to the Graduate
Schools or social events for Imperial’s
sizeable postgraduate community.
Nominate yourself online at www.
imperialcollegeunion.org/vote before
Friday 25 January if you wish to stand.
If you have any questions regarding the
commitment involved for any of these
positions don’t hesitate to get in touch.
Union Council
Union Council is empowered to set
policy (what we think about issues
which affect us all as students such as
top-up fees, academic boycotts and
environmental measures on campus)
on behalf of the Union and gives the
student body an opportunity to question
and direct the work of the Deputy
Presidents and I. The next meeting
will take place 21 Jan at 6.30pm in the
Union Dining Hall on the first floor of
the Union Building. I would recommend
that anyone who has a particular interest
in what views our NUS delegates will
argue for on behalf of the student body
should come along as this will be one
of the items available for discussion.
For those of you who are really keen
papers and sabbatical reports for this
meeting are available for all members
of the Union to read online at www.
imperialcollegeunion.org/committee.
