A name that doesn’t fit here

“Cursor-asterisk-ten”? Gotta
love the quaint Romanised
names given to myriad objects
by the rather innovative Japa-
nese developers out there. Ex-
cept, it actually means some-
thing significant and really
doesn’t become apparent until
the end of this titillating gem.
Painted in simple monochro-
matic, wire-frame graphics, the
concept is relatively simple:
find the stairs and click to pro-
ceed to the next level. There
isn’t a real learning curve or an-
ything of the sort; it’s genuine-
ly that elementary. But there’s
a twist and a glorious twist one
at that. It’s the kind of quirk that
won’t occur to you regardless
of how much thought you put
into it initially. But the fact is,
you will inevitably, irrevocably
get stuck at one point. And you
know who’s going to get you
out of this mess? Yourself.
There’s a hint and I’ll say no
more because figuring out the
true agenda behind the game
gives birth to a satisfaction that
is equal parts warming and
head-shaking disbelief.

Neon Wars

neonwars.html
With the absolutely astounding
success of Geometry Wars on
Xbox Live Arcade, it was inevi-
table that there would be a fair
few clones of the game on the
PC. Our pick of the litter is Neon
Wars, because it completely
changes the game by wresting
control of your guns from you.
Just wait a second with the
pitchforks - what seems like an
over-simplificationofgameplay
ends up working spectacularly.
With no pesky aiming to worry
about, the game can throw
more polygonised enemies
at you than any other shoot-
'em-up. The end-result looks
something like what Las Vegas
would look like if all the neon
signs decided they were sick of
each other and participated in
some good old-fashioned, fric-
kin’ awesome gun violence.

Review
A
nd the race is on as the
shiny, monochromatic
gems fall in pairs as you
make indecisive rota-
tions to set up a chain.
You flick a look at your brother’s area
of the screen.
Damn, same placement. So be it.
The “Next” column reveals a sizzling
sphere pulsating with explosive en-
ergy. As you frantically turn the thing
around to match up colours and let it
drop, first blood is drawn. A devious
snigger or a dignified nod of the head?
I go for a Muttley (the dog) kind of
mixture really.
It starts off aggressively with the only
intention being to dole out as much
hurt as you can to your opponent. A
chain of five? Block with a chain of
nine and the four bits spill-over. Nice.
However, slowly, ever-so-slowly
something becomes apparent in the
acronym-defying Super Puzzle Fighter
II Turbo HD Remix. There’s a certain
sense of organised chaos amidst the
scattered gems, prescient plans form
with certain combinations and a layer
of tantalising strategy is revealed. Sud-
denly all the cryptic comments about
attack and defence (in a gem puzzler?)
start making sense. The gems you
explode end up landing on your op-
ponent’s side doing everything from
blocking his own combinations to just
plain pissing him off. If he sets off a si-
multaneous blast, it counters yours in
a sort of quid pro quo defence mecha-
nise, gem-to-gem. More interestingly,
each of the twelve characters has his or
her own counter set that he or she de-
viously sends your way with a success-
ful detonation. All these realisations
swirl in your mind like some sort of
Hollywood movie flashback (person-
ally, it’s a little black-and-white filter
with a glow effect and with some col-
ours remaining in contrast for me) as
you get back into the game.
(Sonic?) Boom! You’ve linked up an
adjacent column into one uber-gem!
Now is the time to chuckle. Revel in
your glory! You can imperceptibly no-
tice your brother flinch as he screen-
watches. Your eyes get bigger with
each adjunct as your precious baby
gem is now a behemoth waiting to be
touched by the fuse. He fumbles as you
start muttering “Where’s the sparkly
thing? Where’s the sparkly thing?”.
It’s not coming and your brother is
massing up his gem defence.
Shit.
Hey, there it is.
Rows of gleaming teeth that eas-
ily matches the dazzling gem appear.
“Pwnage time”, you can’t help but gloat.
And yes, it’s pronounced “P-own-ej”.
It’s almost touched. Hell yeah.
Warning [12].
Warning? What warning? Why warn-
ing? How warning?
And with a little patter, a row of
twelve numbered gems neatly pile on
top of your heap.
There’s a moment of silence and ut-
ter disbelief as your explosive finale is
blocked by the simplest of gems.
PG-13 be damned.
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.
No, matter... there’s still time, there’s
still time...
A few more detonations here and
there and oh-my-god-Ken-you-gay-
bastard-you-did-not-just-give-him-
the-gems-he-needed....
Remember that defence he was pre-
paring? Well now it’s a big bloated
green... thing. With tinier green gems
adjacent to it like little green things
suckling on a great big green mother...
thing.
C’mon. What are the odds of getting
a green detonator. eh?
Still doubtful, you look up to see
what portends.
Two yellows. Grin.
Another of your detonations returns
the favour as you whoop for joy as a
layer of your own gems candy-coat his
bloated innards. A few more and he’ll
have reached the top and you’ll have
won, nay, pwned him particularly since
you put all that hard work to nought.
“What can you be getting next, eh?”,
you snort.
Oh look, it’s a diamond with a nor-
mal green gem attached.
Your grin becomes plastered to your
face but your eyes reveal the same hor-
ror that is akin to finding out that the
only toilet is clogged. And you had
some of the Chilli Con Carne at the
Union. On a bad night, at that.
Just to spite you he doesn’t even let
it drop immediately, rather allowing it
to gracefully fall. It touches. The dia-
mond sets off a chain reaction that
destroys absolutely everything of the
same colour.
Shinkuuhaaaaadouuuuukeeeeeeen!
Warning [99] is followed by a series
of epilepsy-inducing flashes of lights as
Ryu’s hyper-deformed body lays waste
to the hapless Ken.
And your gem collection turns into
an ashen pile of nothing.
Kaaaaaaak.
“Shut up”, you instinctively snap at
your brother. The cheeky bum knows
that his silent victory leads to a far
greater sense of superiority mainly be-
cause it just lets you sulk moodily.
“Rematch?” he asks with grace.
A gruff nod of the head and both of
you are yelling at the top of your lungs
again.
After four hours of non-stop under-
cutting, abetting and provocation you
realise something quite interesting.
Here you are playing a redux of an
old game with quaintly iridescent
two-dimensional graphics and worse
still, non-HD low-resolution charac-
ter sprites and you’re having the time
of your life – on a piece of hardware
that can output visuals reminiscent of
a Pixar film. In fact, that very game –
Ratchet & Clank: Tools of Destruction
– sits right in front of you.
And you know what? You’re probably
having too much fun to give a damn.
An epic match surges on as Chun-Li cheekily taunts Ryu, blissfully unaware of the dreaded diamond that has cost many a player dearly
