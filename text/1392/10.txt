Better living through probiotics
'Friendly bacteria' reveal themselves to be more than mere tools for helping science geeks score at parties
Guess what – smoking, drinking too
much, abstaining from fruit and veg-
etables and leading a sedentary life are
bad for you and if you do them all at
the same time you are just asking for
trouble.
In a study recently published in PLoS
Medicine, researchers at Cambridge
University examined the relationship
between lifestyle and the risk of dying
and found that adopting four princi-
ples for a healthy lifestyle can have a
huge impact on life expectancy.
Between 1993 and 2006, deaths
were recorded among 20,000 men and
women from Norfolk aged between 45
and 79. Participants were awarded a
point for each of these behaviours: not
smoking, not being physically inactive,
having a moderate alcohol intake and
having a blood vitamin C level consist-
ent with eating five servings of fruit
and vegetables a day.
The study is among the first to exam-
ine the combined impact of these be-
haviours on longevity. After an 11-year
follow-up, the relative risk (compared
to those scoring 4) for all-cause mor-
tality for subjects scoring 3, 2, 1 and 0
was 1.39, 1.95, 2.52 and 4.04, respec-
tively. To put it plainly, a person adopt-
ing none of the above behaviours was
4 times more likely to die during the
study period than a person adopting
them all.
Smoking, predictably, had the biggest
single impact on mortality, followed by
a low vitamin C intake, high alcohol in-
take and physical inactivity.

Have you ever had a gut-wrenching
hangover or indigestion after eating
spicy food? Ever eat yoghurt after-
wards and notice the pain begin to
wane or subside entirely? While it
may seem like a simple by-product
of milk, eating a pot of yoghurt
actually introduces nearly a bil-
lion probiotic bacteria into
your body.
Although these ‘friend-
ly bacteria’ have been
known to aid digestion
and can even be taken
in supplement form,
exactly how these
probiotics work in the
gut has been relatively
unclear until recently.
However, progress
is being made,
and a new study
on probiotics
from research-
ers at Imperial
College and
Nestlé Re-
search Cent-
er in Swit-
zerland
certainly
helps, as
it provides
further
evidence of
how probiotics
could lead to new health
therapies.
The study investigated how probiot-
ics change the biochemistry of adverse
kinds of gut microbes which have been
connected to various medical condi-
tions, such as certain kinds of diabetes
and obesity. Harmful bacteria in the
gut degrade proteins, releasing metab-
olites (chemical by-prod-
ucts of cellular
processes)
including
ammonia,
amines
and in-
doles, all
of which
are toxic
to humans
in high
concen-
trations.
Probiotic
bacteria
actually
help balance
the body’s gut
flora by reducing
harmful bacteria
that cause debili-
tating disease.
For the study
two probiotic
drinks were given
to mice with trans-
planted human gut
microbes.Research-
ers then measured
metabolites taken
from the liver, blood,
urine and faeces of
the mice who received
probiotics and a control
group that did not. Interest-
ingly, the mice treated with probiotics

What really matters is the quality of
life, or functional health, of our ageing
population. This study should be ex-
tended to explore the effect of the com-
bined health behaviours on the quality
of life as well as the risk of death. Nev-
ertheless, with already overwhelming
evidence that the above lifestyle choic-
es influence well-being, and boosted
by the findings from this study, public
health officials should, theoretically,
find it easier to encourage behaviour
changes likely to improve the health of
middle-aged and older people.
Publication of the study coincided
with Gordon Brown’s unveiling of his
‘NHS of the future’. In his plans for a
preventative approach to healthcare,
Mr. Brown said that there would be a
focus on patients whose lifestyle choic-
es – including smoking, drinking and
obesity – made them unwell. There
would be changes to food labelling,
greater access to sport and exercise
and new restrictions on advertising
unhealthy foods. This approach is in-
tended to help the NHS cope with the
challenges of an older and potentially
less healthy population.
In the proposed NHS constitution,
which would set out the rights and
responsibilities linked to entitlement
to care, smokers may find themselves
having to quit in order to maintain
their rights to healthcare. Surely it is
only a matter of time until the over-in-
dulgent and idle among us come under
fire. How long we are going to live may
be the least of our worries.

showed not one, but many beneficial
biochemical effects, primarily due to
ingesting two specific strains of probi-
otic bacteria: Lactobacillus paracasei
and Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
It turns out that the probiotics ac-
tually worked with other bacteria in
the gut of mice, increasing their ef-
fects. Professor Jeremy Nicholson,
corresponding author of the study at
Imperial College Department of Bio-
molecular Medicine, says that probiot-
ics affects metabolism in unique and
complex ways. "Our study shows that
probiotics can have an effect and they
interact with the local ecology and talk
to other bacteria. We're still trying to
understand what the changes they
bring about might mean, in terms of
overall health, but we have established
that introducing 'friendly' bacteria can
change the dynamics of the whole pop-
ulation of microbes in the gut."
In light of the growing scientific and
social concern for obesity, probiot-
ics could also influence how fat is ab-
sorbed by the body. Mice treated with
probiotics showed changes in how
they metabolised bile acids, produced
by the liver to break down fats in the
upper gut.
In the future, probiotic therapies
could assist individuals in overcom-
ing obesity, therapies which have been
customised to the patient’s specific
metabolism. And that’s not all - simi-
lar studies have also revealed that the
synergetic role of probiotics in the gut
means they show potential for treating
a wide range of health ailments from
cardiovascular disease to gastrointes-
tinal cancer.
