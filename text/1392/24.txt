felix@imperial.ac.uk Travel
in an airport waiting room! Over-
all, I remember all the people I came
across and the friends I made with very
fond memories. It left me pondering,
though, as to what is it about poorer
countries that people generally tend
to lead seemingly happier lives there?
Perhaps it is a question we all need to
ask ourselves.
This ‘expedition’ of sorts started in
late July 2007 (after a trip to Pakistan
during the Red Mosque siege!) and
ended in late September 2007. From
the thrill of tracking & snapping wild
animals in their natural habitat to es-
caping conflict; from running mobile
health clinics to getting involved with
the UN and guerrilla rebels; from
climbing 6000m high Mt Kilimanjaro
to active volcanoes; from white water
rafting to studying the Rwandan Geno-
cide in depth and too much more - this
was an all encompassing voyage! …and
also included a meal at Nando’s.
I feel so grateful that I could use this
opportunity to develop my insight into
so many different things in life, and feel
so lucky that all the necessary requisites
were in place. This was the most thrill-
ing adventure I have ever embarked
upon and one that has shaped my life
in ways that even I don’t know yet!
Over the next few weeks, I will do
my best to share this development in
character with you while giving you an
account of major events. Throughout
I was careful to document as much as
(safely) possible using photography so
look out for my accompanying photos.
You won’t find all 4000 of them in Fe-
lix though! I will be uploading many of
them on my Facebook profile so feel
free to search for my profile and take
a good look!
