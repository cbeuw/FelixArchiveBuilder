Even in the middle of Pakistani flea market, the suit somehow fails to draw attention
Charlie Wilson wins your heart
After being touted as the war film
that’s not like the others, Charlie Wil-
son’s War seems to have distanced it-
self from the slayed preachy pieces that
have turned off critics and audiences
alike. Somewhat surprisingly, this isn’t
just a case of marketing tactics, Char-
lie succeeds where the others fall by
pointing out the ridiculous decisions
made by Governments during war.
This isn’t a criticism of Government
policy, but the story of fun loving Tex-
an congressman, Wilson (Hanks), who,
after some influencing from a wealthy
socialite (Roberts), tries to raise sup-
port from the US covert war to get the
Soviets out of Afghanistan during the
last years of the Cold War. Inspired
by a new story (“Based” seems to have
gone out of fashion in films), the fast
talking Wilson is the perfect antithesis
to the straight laced, po-faced politi-
cians of reality and an interesting cen-
tral viewpoint.
The other side of war shows a witty screenplay can spark up two of Hollywood’s fastest dimming stars
Hanks plays him to satisfactory ef-
fect but at no point do you feel that
it was incredibly taxing for him. The
witty script makes a likeable character
out of what could have been simply a
hard drinking, womanising misogy-
nist. How many films these days would
draw a laugh rather than a scowl when
the main character hires an office full
of beautiful women and refers to them
as ‘jailbait’?
Julia Roberts has fallen into the same
category as Brad Pitt in that she is so
blatantly Julia Roberts and not who-
ever is required in the role. She has a
bigger problem in that she could never
act as well as Pitt either, but thankfully
she has conceded to take a support-
ing role here and her grating Texan
drawl is kept to a minimum. Philip
Seymour Hoffman continues to domi-
nate character acting in Hollywood as
a bad-tempered CIA agent, equipping
himself with his usual masterly skill, al-
though he doesn’t reach the heights of
some of his other roles. Still, his char-
acter adds a nice angle that could have
easily been overlooked if a more com-
manding central star had been cast.
The script is the best feature Charlie
has to offer, and studios would do well
to pay heed to this comic, yet sensitive,
portrayal of war. If it goes to show any-
thing, it’s that there’s more to say about
issues when you strip away the tears.
Save those for the Best Actress winner.
