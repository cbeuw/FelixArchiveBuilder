We believe that what we are doing today will help us become
the BP we want to be tomorrow. Our business is the exploration,
production, refining, marketing, trading and distribution of
energy; and we have nearly 100,000 people in 100 countries
across six continents. In this age of growing consumer demand
and environmental urgency, we are always looking to find new
and better ways of delivering energy to the world – without
compromising the planet.
Take up any one of our engineering, science and business
opportunities and you could be helping to find new reserves,
create cleaner fuels, expand our capacity and market our
brands to over 15 million customers every day. Look beyond
the limits.
Deadline for applications has been extended
to 28th January 2008.
BP is an equal opportunity employer.
