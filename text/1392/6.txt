Comment, Opinion

Man of the People™
A
s you can probably tell,
I’m a bit of a Man Of The
People™. I shop at Tesco,
for instance, and I buy
their own brand of juice
instead of that Ocean Spray nonsense.
I think Irish people are more trustwor-
thy because they sound like they’re
all grinning inanely when you speak
to them in tech support centres. I’ve
watched at least two programmes with
Jimmy Carr in them. Yes, it’s true – if
there were an election for Mister Man,
there’d be no need for a recount.
One of the things you’ve got to do to
be a Man Of The People™ is to speak the
things the people want to hear. You’ve
got to be in tune with them, you’ve got
to read The Daily Mail, you’ve got to
know what matters to them. That’s
why, each week, I dutifully sit down in
front of the BBC News page entitled
‘Have Your Say’ and take in the varied
and completely reasonable wisdom of-
fered by the nation’s finest debaters.
Then I stop laughing at the little joke
I tell to myself and start reading what
this week’s Top of the Cocks have de-
cided to offer up in the way of opinion.
Here’s a snippet from last week’s hot
topic:
“This government is not just happy
in just taking our money but want our
bodies as well.
”
Thanks for that, Jim from Peterbor-
ough. The ‘Have Your Say’ phenome-
nonisn’tsomethingdreamtupatWhite
City by bored Beeb execs, of course, it’s
something indicative of the media as a
whole at the moment. The argument
for this kind of discussion starts, pre-
sumably, at the very place that it ends
– The Internet. The Internet is where
the really famous people are, or so it
seems, because although Tom Cruise
only needs to poke a limb outside of
his house to appear instantaneously on
four magazine covers he doesn’t hit the
same area of people’s lives that those
on YouTube & co. do. Cruise is inter-
esting when we’re looking for enter-
tainment, but that depressing chick’s
blog is interesting when we’re looking
for nothing to do at all.
“So now Gordon Brown can tax us to
death and claim our dead bodies for
organs. When will we rise up and stop
this NuLabour obsession with total
control?”
Some chap from Leeds, there. So the
theory goes that people on the inter-
net become famous because they’re
‘real’, and there’s absolutely zero edito-
rial filtering whatsoever. Opinion goes
in, opinion goes out and that’s either a
wonderful thing or a recipe for mass
suicide depending on where you’re
coming from. But hey, if YouTube can
get attention like that just through al-
lowing videos of Asian chicks jiggling
around nondescript beaches, then why
shouldn’t serious things cash in on it
as well? Because as we all know, only
serious people watch serious things,
and that means there’s a veritable
fucktonne of down-to-earth rational
commentary out there to be had. The
more people comment, the more peo-
ple watch for comment, and the more
people get in the debate. Board meet-
ing over. Pack up your Powerpoint,
love – you’re hired.
“Gordon Brown, what was WWII all
about when we stopped Hitler from us-
ing minority people for his medical ex-
periments? And you want to bring back
the body snatchers? For Shame!!!!”
Betty Churchill invoking Godwin’s
Law there, and disobeying the three-
exclamation-mark rule like the libera-
tion of the Nazi Punctuation Camps
never even bloody happened.
In case you’re getting a bit perturbed
by the offcuts from the site by now,
they’re covering the deliciously tedi-
ous story that organ donation may be-
come compulsory in the future. Now
obviously, this was reported without
explicitly saying “for dead people” af-
ter the word “compulsory”, because
that’s entirely implied by the fact that,
you know, that’s how organ donation
works. Nevertheless the Have Your Say
page reads like Brown’s hand is already
up your rear and fondling your spare
kidneys.
“Gordon Brown once again shows the
Orwellian nature of those who presume
to represent the Will Of The People,
whilst bringing in Laws & regulations
for which they have no mandate.
”
Half of this stuff doesn’t even make
any sense – there’s one man who ex-
plains that he’s suddenly ‘reminded’ of
a Monty Python sketch involving an
organ donor, but offers no other argu-
ment whatsoever, suggesting that the
only reason this occurred to him was
because there wasn’t really anything
objectionable to say, he just felt the
need to stir things up. And it’s not all
ridiculous ‘Fuck The System’ types ei-
ther, take a look at this:
“I believe that people who won’t sign
up to donate their organs should also be
placed on a parallel list not to receive
any.
”
And these are the kind of people who
are asking for ‘compassion’ and ‘hu-
manity’ in their comments. This is why
the organ donation story exhibits it so
well, there’s a division between the two
camps of comment writers that’s only
slightly more voluminous that the pre-
sumed gap between themselves and re-
ality. There’s more than a hundred and
twenty pages of repetitive shit on there,
each page growing slightly angrier and
slightly more obscure as the modera-
tors get lazier and start letting any kind
of rubbish in, namely the people who
think New Labour are stockpiling hu-
man hearts for an army of androids
with which they’ll install a totalitarian
regime.
All right, this is one of the reasons
it makes such compelling reading for
up-their-own-passages people such
as myself. It’s great to look it over and
snort at the fact that these people think
that the Government are trying, liter-
ally, to steal things from our cold, dead
bodies. But while the BBC might have
little or no understanding of the kind
of people that comment on things on
the internet, they do understand that
they don’t need to. Because no matter
how bizarre or weird, how downright
absurd these ideas might be, they are
ideas Of The People, and that means
that when something like this crops
up:
“Typical nulab - regards even the
dead as their property! Taxes the peas-
antry in life & then claims the body as
well!!!”
Who cares if it’s nonsensical bullshit?
Two hundred and twenty eight people
‘recommended’ the comment. And if
you can’t offer a video of a chap light-
ing his own farts then I suppose that’s
the next best thing.

espite being one of the
cutest members of the
animal kingdom, the
Yangtze river dolphin,
one of the most majestic
symbols of Asia, is all but extinct. It
now holds the record of being the first
ever cetacean to be driven to extinc-
tion from human activities.
The creature, known as the ‘Goddess
of the Yangtze’ locally and the baiji
internationally, was the reincarnation
of a princess in Chinese mythology.
Forced by her family into a marriage to
a man she did not love, she chose to
drown herself and was reincarnated as
the river dolphin.
Although the baiji was listed on the
International Union for the Conserva-
tion of Nature (IUCN) red list as ‘Criti-
cally Endangered’ for several years, its
population was allowed to dwindle
below numbers from where it could
recover. Anthropogenic factors were
most responsible, such as the decreas-
ing water quality of the Yangtze. Pol-
lution, pumped out from existent and
emerging industries and growing ur-
ban populations along the riverbank,
caused serious health problems for the
dolphins. Toxic chemicals, absorbed by
smaller fish the baiji preys on, persisted
in their bodies once consumed. Their
levels became more concentrated as
they moved up the food chain, causing
blood poisoning and tissue damage for
the baiji population. Noise from the
heavy river traffic interfered with the
communication system used by the
dolphin, leading to impaired breeding
cycles and the occasional unfortunate
collision with boats and machinery. In-
tense fishing activity was also to blame,
with many animals caught as by-catch
in long nets spanning the river basin.
Although a few of those lucky enough
to be disentangled survived, most died
from combinations of weariness and
stress. The habitat of the baiji had been
continually restricted by the construc-
tion of several dams, most notably the
Three Gorges Dam near Sandouping.
Hemmed in, and with oceanic salt wa-
ter at the other end, there was no where
safe for the dolphin to turn.
Even as conservational sirens were
going off and efforts made to preserve
the baiji, all failed due to mismanage-
ment and the classic case of too little,
too late. Of the two females captured
and brought to the Baiji Dolphina-
rium, one was past reproductive age
and the other died after just 17 days.
The last male at the sanctuary, Qi Qi,
died in 2002. A scan of the river by the
Institute for Hydrobiology, Wuhan in
December 2006 failed to find a single
specimen and pronounced the species
as ‘functionally extinct’. A last, con-
tentious sighting was made in August
2007.
But why should we care that some
small, out-of-the-way creature has dis-
appeared? The grass is still green; both
GNP, life expectancy and quality of life
is still high. What does it matter to us?
Due to the increasing interdepend-
ence of the world economy, the prob-
lems of one country become the prob-
lems of many. A recent downturn in
the American real estate market il-
lustrates this, with the UK’s economy
hampered by the global ‘credit crunch’.
The economy of China is currently a
major driving force in world econom-
ics and is closely tied to the state of
China’s environment.
Too often, environmental care is
seen as a burden, an additional lux-
ury to those rich enough to afford it.
However, environmental messes cost
Scorpio
China’s princess six feet under
money both in the short term (such as
negative health effects) and in the long
term (such as flooding from deforesta-
tion and global warming). Just as in
medicine, it is cheaper to prevent the
problem rather than cure the ‘illness’
later on. China currently has one of
the worst environmental records, with
rocketing greenhouse gas and CFC
emissions, rampant deforestation, hab-
itat loss, widespread soil erosion and
desertification. The air quality of many
Chinese cities are amongst the worst in
the world, and land salinization due to
exploitation of groundwater supplies
has crippled vast tracts of agricultural
land. Many of China’s native plants and
animals are also faced with extinction.
Their combined role in the Chinese
ecosystem does jobs that would oth-
erwise cost billions of pounds, such as
nitrogen recycling, soil regeneration,
maintenance of the water cycle, pest
control and decomposition of mate-
rial wastes. Their importance extends
to much more than just income from
tourism. As China develops, its growth
will halt early and abruptly if it does
not effectively and sustainably manage
its environment.
The Yangtze River dolphin should
serve as a wake-up call to us all. The
Gulf of California’s vaquita porpoise
now holds the dubious honour of the
most endangered cetacean on Earth.
We cannot afford to let it go the way
of the baiji.

Even though
conservational
sirens went off
and efforts made
to preserve the
baiji, all failed
due to a classic
case of too little,
too late
