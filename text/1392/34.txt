Warming winter nutrition
Gil Saville

Think of winter food and your mind
conjures up images of thick vegetable
soups, and steaming stews. And sur-
prise, surprise these are exactly the
type of foods you should be eating at
this time of year.
When the days are colder you need
more warmth from your food and this
is provided by these types of meals,
where everything is cooked in one pot
so no nutrients are lost and warming
spices are added to increase the meta-
bolic rate and send heat round the
body.
Now in these days of air conditioning
and central heating and travelling by
car from door to door, we may need this
less than in the past, but the principles
are the same. This is also not an excuse
to throw all your summer healthy eat-
ing out of the window just because it’s
cold outside. The same principles as
summer healthy eating apply but just
adapted to take advantage of all the
seasonal vegetables available.
Warming winter vegitables
Vegetables which are fantastic in win-
ter include; sweet potatoes and pump-
kin (always go for the orange varieties
of both of these vegetables), squashes,
turnips, swedes and parsnips.
All of these are high in Vitamins A
and C, which will help build the im-
mune system and ward off illness. Gar-
lic is another good vegetable to eat at
this time of year as it has proven anti-
viral and anti-fungal properties and
could just help you stave off that cold.
For warming grains go for oats, qui-
noa and brown. Other grains are more
cooling so if you are making or buying
bread try not to make it the staple of
your winter meals.
Other good winter ingredients in-
clude: adzuki (or aduki), beans, black
beans and lentils. Actually any pulse
will do. They have been called the “per-
fect health food” - low in fat and high in
protein and complex carbohydrate and
fibre. They also contain a range of vita-
mins and minerals and are low on the
Glyceamic index, so what more could
you ask? They will add a welcome bulk
to any soup, stew or vegetable side dish
and are an excellent source of protein
and Vitamin B for vegetarians and ve-
gans. If you want to avoid some of the
side effects of these high fibre foods
cook them with fennel or cumin and
make sure you follow the preparation
instructions regarding soaking them if
they are of the dried variety.
It goes without saying that you should
choose foods from good sources and
organically grown whenever possible.
Traces of chemicals found in non-or-
ganic foods often cannot be removed
simply by washing and over time can
build up in your body tissues to unac-
ceptable levels.
Wake up and smell the herbal tea
You may find that you feel a little down
as the nights draw in. Do try to get
outside, especially in the mornings as
the sun comes up. Natural light will
help your pineal gland to switch off its
night-time melatonin production and
act like a natural caffeine boost. Artifi-
cial light is not full frequency light and,
as such, is not as powerful as sunlight
at switching off the pineal and this why
you might feel more sleepy in the win-
ter time.
If you are still not feeling 100% you
might want to try a multi-vitamin and
mineral supplement. Try to buy the
best quality you can and make sure
it is in the best form for your body to
assimilate it. Generally fat soluble vi-
tamins (ADE) are better in capsules
and water soluble (BC) in tablets. And
make sure you get a good cross section
of minerals to help with this too.
Just because it is cold and you might
feel more inclined toward hot drinks,
don’t forget your body still needs at
least 1.5 litres of water a day. If you find
it too cold to drink chilled water, leave
it to stand and drink it at room tem-
perature. It is more re-hydrating that
way anyway as the body doesn’t have
to use energy heating it to body tem-
perature. If you really want a hot drink,
try a herbal tea instead of regular tea
or coffee.
Things to avoid
Try to avoid eating too much dairy
produce. In general these are mucous
forming and won’t help if you are prone
to colds or chesty coughs.
You can still get good quantities of
calcium from tofu, beans and dark
green vegetables (such as kale and
broccoli, the purple variety in particu-
lar, or by sprinkling some poppy seeds
on your food). Eat simple combina-
tions. It may be tempting to stick as
many things as you can into a stew but
you are making it hard for your body to
digest them all. It doesn’t give you the
chance to appreciate the flavours too.
Try to reduce your refined salt and
caffeine intake. (If you must have salt
try to find whole natural sea salt which
is slightly grey.) This is good advice at
any time of the year and even more so
during the winter when your lymphat-
ic, immune systems and liver are busy
trying to keep you healthy.
Following on from the last point try
to avoid chemically altered or highly
refined foods. These will have almost
none of the nutrients that fresh foods
have and could actually be more diffi-
cult for your body to deal with.
All in all eat well, stay healthy and
remember spring is just around the
corner!
