^Jftrof-ile : John Cox
fro:- h
of the three
last year),
The chief reason for profiling John Cox i s that we have
an excellent photograph of him pursuing vacation studies
appropriate to a second yecr matheDatician.
John vras bom in Cardiff i n 1935, and lived there most
of his l i f e until he caa\e to I.C. two years ago. Hi3 life
before 19>3 is censored, exept that he did play the part
of the short is: hamlet.
rsain activities i n the college have staunched
association with the OoraauEist Party. He is one
college^ (a ^0>o increase in membership on
and proposed that politics should net be taken
seriously at a recent debate.
As aclitor of "PhcDiiix" for the current issue, he just
took or. another union job, to D
O added to his long association
with various committees.
In addition to these, he has found time to attend hops
regularly, and desperately considers hij.iself among the more
eligible of 1.0. men since the State has refused to niaintain
him while he repeats the second year of his course.
Besides bus conducting, John has had jobs as mortuary
attendant, cemetary grass cutter, and other morbid occupa-
tions which liave increased his conversational range consider-
ably, but unfortunately curtailed his literary liberty to
"Felix?,
Altogether, John is : likeable felio-.T whose exuberance
and enthuaium do not let him miss Diore serious aspects
ef life, nee-let him ndncS the inevitable leg-nulling and
baitiar- that Ids political ide.-s produce.
John Cox has a few aabitiocB in life, lie -,-ould ilke to
get a room in the Fostel, start a collective and curb
inflation.
Anna Christie
By Eugene O'Neill
Presented by the Conue Players.
The Comus Players are a group of ex-members
of I.C.D.S. and t h e i r f i r s t production as a group
was "Anna C h r i s t i e " , performed at the P o r t c u l l i ' s
Thearte, Westminster, l a s t Saturday evening. In
spite of a lack of polish, the production was of
a reasonably high standard and the acting was, a t
times, very good indeed. The three main characters,
jlayed by Barbara Harris, Ieuan David and Tony Osman
were a l l very well portrayed, leuan David's perform-
ance being especially Accomplished.
The d i f f i c u l t i e s attending t h i s undertaking,
p a r t i c u l a r l y the fact that the theatre could be
aired f o r one day only meant that the sets were
rather rough, but two of the three settings were
quite e f f e c t i v e nevertheless.
The large audience received the play w e l l ,
and we hope that the Comus Players w i l l put on
more plays of the quality of "Anna C h r i s t i e . "
Phoenix
This term, Phoenix i s r i s i n g later than
usual from the ashes, and i t should be on sale

It has an international nature, containing
a r t i c l e s by students here from abroad, and
concerning vacation jaunts last summer. In t h i s
category, the social l i f e of the G l i d i n g Club
on t h e i r Yugoslav tour i s entertainingly written
by the Editor-Elect of Phoenix, Vere Atkinson,
An abridged version of the Rectors inaugural
address i s included (reviewed i n FELIX No.83),
An account of the 'digs' s i t u a t i o n i n South
Kensington gives us a new slant on the currert
position, and suggests a new Lodgings Bureau
be set up i n South Kensington which would do more
for I.C. students than the present one i n Bloomsbury,
Robin bray's a r t i c l e on motor cycling and
poetry i s amusing, and shows him to be trusted i n
his p o s i t i o n on the l i b r a r y committee to buy us

previous readers who w i l l from experience know what

diverse assortment of a r t i c l e s since they read
their f i r s t copy.
