SOMNAHBULATIONS UP THE GREEK
The circumstances wider whioh I am nltiag this are rather
strange,and i t is true to say that until five minutes ago
I had no intention or indeed no necessity of setting dowm
on paper the strange adventure which within the space of
one week has put ten years in age on my appearance.
Perhaps I had setter explain the reason for my sitting
outside a small oave on a bleak winds«apt moor,vriting a
story ,whioh i f i t is to have a conclusion will Just pass
off as one of a thousand unexplained stories.Xet i f there
is no conclusion, the reader must draw upon his O
W
E imagijs-
ation to visualise the possible fate whioh has prevented »e
from writing i t .
Just one week ago I had a rather strange dream,whioh
although rather meaningless the following morning,negani to
have some small significance when the same dream visited ray
slumbers the next night. Once again the bright morning S

light streaming in through iny window helped to clear away
the strange vision of the dark hours.During the day I could
not prevent my thoughts from turning to the dream whioh
had haunted my slumbers on the last two evenings. On the
third night I went to bed with mixed feelings of curiosity
and fear^As the cold November wind swept down from the
moors and a distant dock struck two my curiosity "as
satisfied whilst my fear was renewed with violent easaggera-
tioni,
* I am walking along a little used track across a
part of the moor unknown to myself^and rounding a snail
rise I see a anall oponing set in,a low line of dark orags.
I have no control over the intense curiosity whioh leads me
to explore the dark passage which enters into the clifff..
I reach a certain, point in the passage and the dream fades.
I wake up and find myself oold and shivering in the solitude
of my own dark roomtlFbr 3even nights I have been the victim
of this frightening visitation. Saoh night I have been led
further along the passage,and by the increasing fear within
me I know that the meaning of my dream is shortly to be
revealed^and I know that the secretcis contained at the end
of the passage.By my fear I know that whatever I find will
be beyond the sooiety of earthly beings.
Tb-day is Sunday and in order to escape from the veil of
fear that shrouds my house,I have motored out onto the moors.
Leaving the car parked off the road, I set out aoross a deser-
ted part of the moor unknown to myself.With sudden horror I
discovered that the path I was B
O
W on was the dreaded path
of my dreanuBram on by the same irrepresible urge I experv
ienoe in my dream, I continue until the path ends. The small
cliff that confronts me is to familiar by now,and I realise
that my mystery will shortly be solved - i f only by myself.
It has just oocured to me that before I enter from the light
into the dark I will set down the few words you have just
read.At least you will know part of my. story. Uhe fear whioh
has haunted me fo™ the last week has gone, and I am left only
with the desire to write a conclusion to what I have already
written.Soon i t will be dark and so I must hurry.Already the
storm clouds are gathering,and as I lay down my pea the first
drops of rain start to fall.

Unfortunately the Christmas 'vacation' i s (almost
with me again. Once again I have to face that per-
iod which f o r me i s colourless except f o r C h r i s t -
mas morning. Father i s giving me a new s l i d e r u l e
t h i s year. Not very long a f t e r T return from the
b i t t e r grind of t h i s 'holiday' comes - exams.' i f
the others don't work l i k e me and my friends, ws
say that they w i l l never get through,
tt r e a l l y i s not f a i r to be disparaging about
people l i k e me who treat our studies with utmost
IMMBMII, Be s h a l l be the leaders; sf the nat-
ion. I t was with groat d i f f i c u l t y that I was able
to f i n d time to write t h i s a r t i c l e f o r FELIX, but
i t i s about time somebody understood our point
of view. Perhaps I w i l l buy the paper f o r once
and see what i t i s l i k e . Of court*, I weant read i t
during the f i r s t lecture because Professor F i n k l e -
s t e i n sometimes makes mistakes on the blackboard
and be would probably be disappointed i f I did not
po^nt thee) out to him. I wonder i f he would think
I was 'creeping* i f I sent him a Christmas card
t h i s year.
Naturally, I can afford te do things l i k e that.
I have half of my grant l e f t over this > «r«. I
am wondering what to give my friend* * i tions
for Christmas. However, I must not be ! rash as
Professor Finkleeteln Bays that we f i l l need s i x
new textbooks f o r his subject next half-session.
I though that «y relations would be very impress-
ed i f I sent them the most expensive college Chr-
istmas cmrda. They are very interested i n my c o l -
lege career - i n f a c t Uncle George says that we
have a budding Einstein i n the family. Personally
I think he i s going a b i t too f a r . I might iecooe
S lecturer at I.C. I t would be fun to get my own
aek on those boisterous rude fellows who object
te me working on Wednesday afternoons.
In eemeluslon then, may I wish th# readers of
t h i s hsaible a r t i c l e a suecer-fwl v»e*u»T» :ind a
Happy Christmas. I hop* that they w i l : c«e back
afterwards with a better understanding of OUR
POINT OF raw.
