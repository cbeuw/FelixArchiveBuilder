LIMERICK COMPETITION
Readers had been warned, unnecessarily
perhaps, of the d i f f i c u l t y of scansion i n the
limerick competition. Because t h i s had been
stressed, the judges looked for those limericks
which achieved the almost impossible. This re
restricted the range considerably, and after
assessing the rhymes and content matter there
was l i t t l e doubt as which should be put to the
audience to decide the winner.
Several of the audience were as disappointed
with the standard as the judges, and made
further contributions. One of these, D.M.G.'s
is worth publishing:
There once was a young lady botanist
Whose standard of work was the rottenist.
The reason was clear,
She had spent most the year,
Converting an I.C. misogynist.
Among the unprintable limericks, Barnacle
B i l l could have improved his last line to be
an easy winner. K.Nups was the actual winner
in this category, though an entry on a pink
ticket (name available) only f a i l e d on the
last l i n e , which was almost repentent.
N j e J s o n V C o l u m n
Students w i l l be pleased to read the
following message that was telegraamed to the
Queen Mother on t h e i r behalf on November 24th.
To Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth the
Queen Mother
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY
We, the Governing Body, the Professors,
the Staff and the Students of the Imperial
College of Science and Technology, offer our
humble duty to Tear Most Gracious Majesty on
the occasion of Your Majesty's I n s t a l l a t i o n
as Chancellor of the University of London.
We are mindful of the continued interest
shown by the Royal House i n our College, ana
p a r t i c u l a r l y we remember with gratitude two
v i s i t s paid by Your Majesty, with His late
Majesty King George VI, f i r s t on 21st October,
1926, on the occasion of the opening of the
Goldsmiths * Company's Extension to the City and
Guilds College Building, and l a t e r on 25th.
October, 1945. when we celebrated the Centenary
of the foundation of the Boyal College ef
Chemistry.
We pray that God may preserve Year Majesty
for many years to come aa Chancellor ef our
university, and offer our loyal devotion.
Dated t h i s twenty-fourth day of November,
Oae Thousand Nine Hundred and F i f t y Five. "
This document waa signed by the Rector and the
Chairman of the Governing Body.
In the evening, the College waa host to
v i s i t o r s from ether Universities, p r i o r to t h a l r
presentation at St. Jamas Palace to tha new
Chancellor.
The Mining and Metallurgy Society's recent
Vacation Work Survey amongst Miners showed that
the greatest preference was f o r Canada, the
second f o r the Continent (provided the fare waa
paid), and the t h i r d f o r Africa. The survey also
revealed that 40* had worked before coming to
college and that 37* had completed t h e i r National
Service.
It may well be asked why Guilds should not be
brought into line with Mines and R.C.S. and
c a l l e d the Royal something. There are however
d i f f i c u l t i e s . We heard from a man who was acquain-
ted with I.C. some time ago, that a Royal School
of Engineering had been contemplated i n the distant
past. Unfortunately i t would have been more of
an embarrassment than a privelege to w r i t e the
Associarteship after one's name.

Royal College of Science Association Dinner
Last Friday the R.C^S. Association held i t s
Annual Dinner at the t r a d i t i o n a l venue, the
Rembrandt Hotel. The diners and dancers included
a f a i r number of present students and t h e i r guests
and also several past presidents of the R.C.S.
Union. The students were reassured to see that
the older members o,f the Association looked pleas-
antly prosperous, and the evening, as always, was
extremely enjoyable.
A highlv succesful "get together" was held i n
the upper regions of Selkirk Hall a week last
Saturday. About twenty I.C. men barricaded them-
selves i n a room with a barrel of Merrydown and
numerous bottles. The party proceeded merrily i n
spite of the frantic efforts of their host to j o i n
them. After a v i s i t by the 'gentlemen i n b l u e ' a l l
non-residents were obliged to leave, (apart from
a f o r l o r n and forgotten body l e f t on the roof),
never to return.
Those students of I.C. who are ignorant of f l u i d
mechanics (2066 uncomprehending minds i n a l l ) w i l l
be interrested to hear that the side pannels inside
the Union door are a protection against draughts.
Those who are capable of solving d i f f e r e n t i a l
equations may speculate on the p o s s i b i l i t y of the
draught being diverted around the s k i r t s of I.C.W.A.
We w i l l watch and hopefully wait.
Brian Oggy, a second year Physics student at
I.C. yesterday jumped safely from, a second f l o o r
window i n R.C.S. on to the pavement. Interviewed
by a D**ly M**l reporter, Brian, who i s an
Idleburger said, "A friend of mine was handing out
fags down there and I wanted a smoke, so I jumped"
THE I.C. JAZZ BAND made their f i r s t appearance
last Wednesday week,when they supported the A l f
Baker band at the Jazz Hop.The hop was somewhat
slow to warm up as most I.C.men s t i l l need to
spend quite a long time i n the bar,before aband-
oning the slow,slow,quick-quick,slow,"Do you
come here often? " routine.Most,however,were
enjoying themselves i n fine style well before
the hop ended. Taoy again showed their very fine
promise at the FELIX dance;they are led by Terry
McVeigh,who was Secra*aw»f of the Jazz Club last
year.
ire you wondering what to give your g i r l friend
for Christmas ? Give MM-MM-M1 ! - the barley snr-
ar flavoured l i p s t i c k . MM-MM-M lasts the whole
evening through.
