We celebrated tne s i x t h birthday of FELIX
with the usual dance which puts a l l other Sat-
urday evening hops i n the shade. The f i l m show
featured our beloved cat and recieved the usual
welcome from the audience, with the exception
of the gentleman unwise enough to feature him-
s e l f on the screen at the same time. The jazz
band played at i t s best yet, and the bar pro-
vided a popular colourful diversion.
To the many people who were unable to get
into the dance we apologise, but i t i s better
to l i m i t the number of dancers than make
dancing impossible f o r everyone.
