CANTO 1.
Tnere was a time when, dainty Mignonette
Was rather more than l e s s affectionate.
Each peeping dawn would spot some gentle boy
Scuttling home, his footsteps charged with joy,
To s t i r h i s bedclothes into such array
As might withstand much scrutiny next day.
This was the time when every bloke i n sight
Did seem apparelled i n c e l e s t i a l l i g h t .
Alas! as a l l things pass, one dreadful night
She said "No more", and blushed, and hid from sight,
"Jwas thought she wished to wed and would reoover
The pureness that deserves a constant lover.
Ah woe! to hear sweet Mignonette aver
That Immorality was not f o r her!
Within an hour the v i l l a g e slumped i n gloom:
The Poet raved himself into the tomb;
The Scholar .jouid not settle to hie book;
The Curate wore a lean and w i s t f u l look;
The Butcheri with a, smile of mute appeal,
Detached'a urua.%,' ana minoea i t with eo.rie veal..
When winter same,the grief was not dispelled
And a l l the a i r a solemn s t i l l n e s s held.
CANTO 3.
Ohilde Roland to the darK. tower came wherein"
ine lovely sinner strove to banish s i n .
He struck trie door: nought save the echo spoke.
He twined his arms about a creaking oak
And swung to where a window'broad and high
Flung an unearthly l i g h t into- the sky.
Ye Muses nine! 3ive ear unto my ory
That I may truly t e l l the sight that met his eye!
CaNTO 4.

jaint A&nes's Eve- Ah bitter c h i l l i t was!
Tne monkey on the village pub sign froze,
And chattered brassily with teeth of ice
To chill-shod winter birds and raw-nosed mice.
Inside the pub no cheerful blaze did gleam:
A dismal candle shed a doleful beam
'.Yuicn guttered palely i n eaon mournful face,
Disclosed on each a miserable grimace,
Inen tottered to the tankards dark with dust
And perished i n the pewter dull with rust.
A sudden crash! A young man smote tne bar
And spake. His voice was firm and carried far.
Many a simple maiden t h r i l l e d to hear
This challenge proudly uttered, c l a r i o n clear.
" I ' l l come to thee ere morning, Mignonette.
No force nÂ«a ever aeld Chllde Roland yet!"
Tnen out be strode, out i n the swirling snow.
Wild eyed, the. huddled mourners watched him go.
The reader wno has knowledge of these things
T i l l know that he who grabs a tree and swinge
Aloft to where a window broad and high
Flings any sort of light into the sky
Is l i k e l y to be ratner snort cf breath,
And not to breathe may oause an early death.
Childe Roland then, caught i n tnis pretty pass,
Expelled some a i r which-fell-'-upon the glass,
Waere-on lay sundry points of nucleation
(Ions, impurities and radiation)
Which caused a catastrophic condensation.
Thus when ne tried to look,- Childe Roland saw
A patina of frosted glass- no more.
Tne snocK was suon, Juilde Roland lost i.is nuid
And f e l l , and died exhausted by tne cold.
The moral of
Not to indul
tale i s clear ,.to me:
