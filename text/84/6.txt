Dear Friend,
This chain l e t t e r i s started by a man
l i k e yourself, i n the hope that i t w i l l bring
r e l i e f and happiness to t i r e d and bored working men
Unlike most chain l e t t e r s , t h i s does not
cost you a red cent. Simply send a copy of t h i s
l e t t e r to f i v e of your friends who are t i r e d and
bored. Then bundle Up your wife and send her to
the man whose name appears on the top of the l i s t .
When your name appears on the top of the l i s t , you
w i l l receive 16,748 women. Some of them w i l l be a
h e l l of a b i g improvement on what you had. Have
f a i t h ; do not break the chain. One man did and he
got his old woman back.
Sincerely,
Tommy Manville.

P.S. At the date of writing t h i s , a friend of mine
had received 356 women. They buried him yesterday.
It took three undertakers t h i r t y - s i x hours to get
the smile o f f h i s face.

ening, i n be»r, of Clementine.
Below i s the Ola, read by Brian Lowson, written
especially f o r tha ceremony.
(Orator facoa the crowd)
Loud l e t the trumpets play
On t h i s auspicious day
While belching cannon bursts with reeling f i r e .
Let brass on either hand
Resound throughout the land
To s t i r the l i v i n g youth i n every shire.
Now wedded with these festive sounds divine.
We thnnd1
rously acclaim the name of Clementine.
Our f a r flung envoys went
To Horsaondon i n Kent
Where In a f i e l d of scented hops she l a y .
They brought her heme i n atate-
A good s i x hundredweight
Of finest coal was taken on the way.
And now, my friends, ear Clementine i s bores
That f i e l d of scented hops did not provide her bier.
(The Orator turns to the Tractor)
We a l l must corns to dust.
And though decay and rust
Consume thee at a hundredweight per annaa,
There's yet a century '
Of healthful l i f e f o r thee-
A hundred years I Who else of u* w i l l spas 'em?
And so i n praise of then we raise oar song
For, c a l l i n g thee immortal, we cannot be f a r wrong.
(The Orator, more quietly, again addresses the crowd)
Oh friends, when years l i e ueaa
Aboat each s i l v e r head
That rises now so confident . young,
Then s h a l l >our thoughts, with sart
Dwell on these earlier yeara
And half-forgotten glories s h a l l be sung.
Then s h a l l each t a l l the youngest of h i s l i n e
The story of the day we christened Clementine
(The Orator, bottle i n hand, turns f i n a l l y
to tha tractor)
The Royal School of Mines
Regales no friend with vines:
In English bear we celebrate thy fame.
Roll through the yeara to be
In splendid rajeaty,
And, growing eld, bring honour to our same.
We wish thee wall; aay fortunes grace be thine.
Now, washed i n foaming ale, we name thee Clementine.
