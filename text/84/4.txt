TARZAW TAKES A BOW
In t h i s story have been inserted the
names of 40 famous composers, The l e t t e r s
of each name are i n a jumbled order but
are consecutive. The anagram may be a word
i t s e l f , or, more often, may be spread over
one or more words or from one sentence t o
another. For example, TALLIS- might be shown
as " I had to canceL A LIST of engagements."
Punctuation i s to be disregarded.
Above the entrance to the cave waa a notice
"Do not Disturb". Echoing from the cave
came wailings which f i l l e d the forest and
sent shivers down the spines of i t s deniz-
ens, Tarzan, who had bought himself ai v i o -
l i n during one of his rare Hollywood -
sponsored t r i p s to c i v i l i z a t i o n , was pract-
i s i n g . At last the session ended, and he
l e f t the cave to face his audience, a
synod of monkeys. A f a r from s i l e n t t r i b e ,
they had been gnaskdng their incisors i n
rage and making unpleasant ribald noises
while he played, and now, grabbing coconuts
and any other handy missile, bunged them
at him.
F i f t y coconuts flung at close range i s
a bigger barrage than most men can take
but Tarzan, shewing rare presence of mind
dodged a l l but one, bowed b r i e f l y and
started walking slowly back to his v i l l a
under the palms. Arrived there he sat
brooding, rubbing h i s bruised l e g and med-
i t a t i n g on the mutability of things i n gen-
eral and the s o l i d i t y of coconuts i n part-
i c u l a r . Suddenly, jungle woman Gerraaine
burst into the room, "Tarzan," she cried,
sobbing with terror,"They've come to get
us* again".
"Who?" said Tarzan, "de M i l l e or Zukor?",
Advancing to the doot he saw several men
approaching and, adapting h i s mode of ad-
dress to suit the occasion, stepped out
and hailed the nearest.
"Me Tarzan", he said p o l i t e l y , although
in tones not always used by stars towards
their potential directors. "Me and mate
not available go along you topside Holly-
wood. Kindly see contract clause f i v e . "
"Why, Mr.Tarzan", said the leader of
group, a round l i t t l e man with a large
bowler hat,"You mistake our purpose i n
coming. We are not connected with the
motion picture industry, I wish to en-
gage you for a series of concerts i n Londot
I am told that you play the v i o l i n , and
though a good namber of people have said
that you are not i n the same class as
K r e i s l e r . . . . "
"Culpable slander, s i r " , said Tarzan
kindly,"the work of viporous tongues.
I am much abused. My playing has to be
heard to be believed. They were l i a r s . "
Tactfully the l i t t l e man stemmed the
flow. "No doubt they were, but what about
my offer? I cannot brook a refusal. London
audiences are ready f o r someone to i d o l i z e .
B r i t a i n awaits you. Think of the sensation,
the incredible scenes of enthusiasm. You
w i l l be heard by audiences who w i l l ex-
press their emotions a thousand times
more wildly than any audiences here."'
Tarzan was s i l e n t , wincing as he trans-
lated this into undodgable coconuts. Then
he took his v i o l i n and broke i t over h i s
knee. The price was too much.
"I no play", he said, "us stars s t i c k
to Hollywood."

the
CSse Seaday morning before the service, the
Verger noticed three members of the congregation
seated i n the church. He was standing with the
B e l l r i a g e r and said: " I have a problem, I wonder
whether- you can solve i t ? There are three members
of the congregation; the product of t h e i r ages
Is 2450 and the sum of t h e i r ages equals twice
your age. T e l l me, how o l d are they?"
At the end of the service, the Bellringer
retormed and said: " I can't solve your problem
as I need a further clue." The Verger replied:
"I am older than any of you."
