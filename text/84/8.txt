The season has now almost reached the half-
way mark and I.C, have every reason to f e e l proud
of the club's results to Bate.
The Ist XV has won 10, lost 3 aad d r a m 1 ef
i t s matches, scoring 208 points witu 77 against.
The forwards are now playing w e l l together, and owe
much to the enthusiastic leadership of the captain
Brian Corbett. The backs are sound i n attack and
defence, despite some eccentricity at outside half.
I.C. have reached the semi-final of the
University Cup by two magnificent victories over
powerful opponents i n King's (24-0) and Royal Vets
(22-0). In the match against Vets I.C. faced a
c r i s i s when Dingle was injured early i n the match.
However Palmer acquitted himself with d i s t i n c t i o n
at the unaccustomed position of scrum half, and
the team was able to r a l l y to a fine victory. They
meet Wye i n the semi-final, and last Saturday beat
them 9-0 i n a "frieddly" game. Barnes scored two
t r i e s and Lewis kicked a penalty. The game was
otherwise undistinguished except f o r an Impassioned
appeal by the I.C. captain "to keep up with the
play"- directed not at his own forwards but at the
referee.
For the f i r s t time I.C. are running s i x
regular teams, a noteworthy milestone i n the club's
fine history. A l l the teams have good records. The
2nd XV have achieved this despite the insobriety
of "their leader. The A XV took Wye by storm i n
more ways than one, and have discovered a new
b r i l l i a n t wing three-quarters to supplement the
talent they already boast at scrum-half.

Squash Club out of U.L. Cup
With one match yet to be played the dub can look
back on a very successful terms squash. The first team
have played eleven matches, winning ten and losing one.
The one defeat was against Westminster when the final score
after a hard match was 3-2.
This fixture against Westminster was also played as
a tournament match being part of the first round of the
U.L. 3 a-side championship. Here again the team was
unfortunate the match being decided against us only in
the Fifth game o f the last tie.
Since that match the team nave been victorious
against Rings College and University College Hospital.
The draw is now being made far the Whiteley Cttp
tournament. All members of the ciLub are invited to play
and those wishing to do so should contact an offioiaT of
the club or sign their name on the list provided cm tho
quash club notioe board.
Would those dubs who would lUce their activities reported
iM "Felix? pleas* send i» their reports to the Sparta Editor
by the Saturday night,( or- Sunday morning at the latest)
before "Felix" is on sale. This heartfelt plea is issued
jointly by the Sports M, and a friend of his.
The 1st XI have had mixed fortunes i n the last
few matches. A resounding 5-1 defeat by L.S.E. in
the league gave our players mach to think about
i n the way of constructive play and kaennesa in tackle •
However we seemed to have learnt the lesson by the
following Saturday Nov. 26th when Corinthian
Casuals I I I were beaten 5-2. A very definite
improvement i n the standard of play was noticed i n
this game and the half backs and forwards were
swinging the b a l l about and making use of the long
pass down the middle. The l a t t e r led to two goals
being scored by G.S.Green, last years captain, who
has recently made a very welcome return to the f i r s t
team.
On Saturday Dec. 3rd. the 1st and 2nd Xl's
entertained Reading University and enjoyed two
very keen matches. The f i r s t team drww 3-3 i n a
game which was f u l l of t h r i l l s and good goals
even though the midfield play was generally scrappy.
The second XI went down 2-3, after scoring the f i r s t
two goals, In a game they claimed they should never
have l o s t .
We apologised to the members of the 4th XI
affected by the recent cancellations. On a l l but
one occasion this has been caused by lack of support
for this team. Next Saturday the 1st team play
t h e i r old r i v a l s Goldsmiths i n the second round
of the cup. Any supporters w i l l be most welcome
i f only to drown the s.rieks of those feminine
Goldsmith's aspirants on the touchline.
