lattened symbols look really nice, and
the redesign of the main programs
like safari, maps and calendar look
really nice. he biggest thing though
is the added capabilities of your mac
in terms of a mobile. Basically you
will not only get your iMessages on
your mac, but also actual mms and
sms. his will make Messages quite a
bit more useful, and helpful in terms
of keeping all your information in one
place. However, the thing that really
intrigued me is the fact that you can
now make and receive calls on your
mac. If your mac is connected to the
same Wii network as your iPhone,
then when your receives a call, you
get a notiication on your mac and
are several features that are really
interesting.
Firstly, the new messaging app,
which looks to jump on the wave
of new messaging methods. Apple
have introduced a handy new way of
sharing their location, pictures and
videos, as well as generally making it
feel more whatsapp-y.
Secondly, Apple have now
introduced a new app, HealthKit,
which will collate all available health
data from other apps and gadgets, and
perhaps in the future predict when
you may need to go to the hospital..
his points to Apple releasing some
kind of gadget that will tie in with
this, perhaps a smartwatch? One
I
t is now summer (for most of
us at least!). If you have nothing
lined up for you, and would like
to learn something new or do
something productive, why not
consider learning how to program?
Have you ever tried to rename
hundreds of files, or tried to
organise some data files with
thousands of entries by hand? If
you have, you would know that the
task is arduous and tedious, and you
would be better off automating it.
Programming can allow to do that,
and you spend less time in front
of the computer, and more time in
the sunshine! (Or at least that’s the
theory)
Learning to program can improve
your logical thinking skills. While
some algorithm to sort numbers
may sound easy to comprehend, it
is a different matter when you sit
down and try to implement it. You
would also be more appreciative of
the work that programmers put in
when you use software, or when you
encounter some bugs.
There is an adage saying that
everyone can be a programmer,
and then there is another camp
that says that not everyone can
be a programmer. People argue,
with the backing of studies that
shows that a consistently high
percentage of students fail their
programming courses at University,
that not everyone is cut out to be
a programmer. On the other hand,
there are educators that attribute the
failures to the way programming is
taught, and that everyone can learn
to program if taught properly. In this
author’s humble opinion, everyone
should just give programming a try
first before they raise their hands in
the air and give up.
I
n recent times I have become
quite disillusioned with Apple.
he keynotes were kinda boring,
and there was nothing really
interesting. I usually tuned in to
the keynotes just because I felt that I
should. In fact, it got to the point that
this time around, I almost missed the
keynote. When I did open the stream,
I found I had missed out completely
on the new OS X presentation,
named Yosemite, but just managed to
catch iOS 8.
I was immediately surprised by the
lightness of the talk, I mean one of
the jokes was about a mad hairdresser
ruining Craig Federighi’s hairdo.
Instantaneously I was paying more
attention than I had in the previous
three keynotes. Furthermore, there
were actual moments in the keynote
where I sat up and said, wow that
is pretty cool. I have not had that
since the iPhone 4 release! So here is
the low down on the two big things
release:
he big thing about OS X Yosemite
is a closer alignment with iOS and
mobile, thus tying its users more
closely into the Apple eco system.
Firstly, there is a redesign of all the
icons, more in style of iOS 7. he
OS X, iOS and full-frontal Apple
then it can act as a speaker for your
phone. I ind this a really cool feature,
especially since I am someone who
tends to leave my phone somewhere
and then lay down somewhere else,
often getting to lazy to get up again.
While this step is more evolutionary
than revolutionary (I feel I have
applied this cliché quite a few times
to Apple releases) it is a really positive
evolution, and I welcome more like it.
While iOS 7 was a real game
changer in terms of iOS, 8 continues
that revolution in great style. here
thing that did come about from the
HealthKit announcement was the
naming debacle. Another company
which does something similar to the
app, already has that name, twitter
handle and website. herefore you
may see a name change.
he last feature that really
interested me is Apple’s new open
approach. his is irst exempliied by
the fact that iOS devices will be able
to use external keyboards come fall.
his means that Android users will
no longer be able to brag about being
able to use Swype and Swiftkey, while
smirking at Apple users with their
crappy keyboard. In a similar vein,
Apple has now allowed developers
to add widgets to their apps. Now,
notiication centre will actually
become actually useful.
here were many other exciting
features, like a redesign of multi-
tasking, which if you have a
compatible iOS device I would
seriously consider checking out if I
was you.
his is a really good update to iOS,
which I await with anticipation.
his keynote was Apple without
fear, without expectation. hey
introduced great new products, and
even a new programming language,
swift. hey have made their platform
more open for developers and
customers alike. Finally they seemed
to have shrugged of some of the “fail-
without-Jobs” aura, and moved on. I
really hope for more of this.
iOS 8
here are lots of programming
tutorials on the internet, but not all
of them are equal. If you are new
to programming, you should not
worry about all the funny jargon and
technicalities involved, especially the
bit about “abstraction”. Start with
something concrete, and fun. You
could start by going to the Khan
Academy and searching for a course
on computer programming.
Otherwise,youcouldpickalanguage
and start learning to program from
the language. Once you have a irm
grasp on one programming language,
new languages will be relatively
easy to learn. I would recommend
that beginners start with Python, a
powerful and versatile programming
languages. It also introduces some
very useful programming paradigms
and techniques that you might just
ind enlightening and interesting.
he oicial Python website has an
extensive tutorial on learning the
language.
Once you have a irm grasp on
one language, you could try working
on some interesting projects. For
example, you could try coding a
program to calculate one billion
decimal places of pi, just for fun.
Or learn a second language, such as
C++ which is used more widely, but
especially unforgiving for newcomers.
