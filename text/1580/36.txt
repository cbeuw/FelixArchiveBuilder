Take a look at our World Cup Preview Pullout!
On Tuesday the 10th of June ICUCC
headed out to Regents Park pumped to
prove that we were the best cricketing
side in London. Some of us more alive
than the rest.
On a side note being dragged out of
bed at 8 in the morning after 3 hours
sleep to play cricket because ‘‘we’re
short’’ is not fun or pleasant so cheers
Dave.
his whole tournament was
organised by UCL who were so keen
they decided to buy a horrendous
looking purple T20 kit just to try and
put out that they were a dominant side.
Also they had to be a pain because of it
and bowl with a white ball.
match 1: ICUCC vs UCl
After winning the toss ICUCC decided
to bat irst. Vishal and Hemant opened
the batting, however both managed to
lose their wickets cheaply: Vishal to a
spectacular catch at slip and Hemant
being bowled out. Sam also managed
to lose his wicket fairly cheaply for 5.
Which left it to Viggy and Karan to
rebuild the innings aided by the help
of what was probably two of the worst
umpires that have ever existed. hey
were probably taught the rules the
morning of the match.
Karan was stumped at least 3 times
and run out twice, all of which was
given not out. hey also struggled
to count and would constantly get
the numbers ive and six confused.
However Viggy eventually lost his
wicket to an attempted big haul over
mid of. In came Arjun, who also lost
his wicket fairly cheaply, and Huzaifah
essentially went straight back after
walking in due to some horrendous
calling by Karan.
Karan eventually lost his wicket at a
point were we really didn’t have much
on the board. But a last ditch cameo
from Dave, Tom and Shaneil (mostly
Dave) left us with a semi respectable
score of 112.
In reply UCL started with a
diamond duck with their opener
nicking behind. A constant stream of
wickets meant that UCL were under
constant pressure and Imperial looked
on course for a simple victory. But
the umpires simply couldn’t let this
happen which led them to give UCL a
six point penalty for Imperial having a
slow over rate.
Drama emerged in the inal over in
which UCL required 5 runs in the last
over but the umpires managed to cock
up their counting again, claiming that
UCL required two of the last ball. his
sent UCL into uproar causing them to
sprint onto the pitch with a scorebook
to argue. Eventually the umpires gave
in depite Viggy’s protest. However
some excellent death bowling by
Shival meant that Imperial could hang
on for the win.
Batting igures:
Viggy: 36
Dave : 21
Karan: 18
Bowling Figures:
Shaneil: 4-0-18-2
Tom: 4-0-18-2
Viggy: 4-0-22-2
match 2: ICUCC vs kings
Kings managed to see of LSE,
comfortably scoring 217-1 with one of
their openers scoring a hundred odd.
Winning the toss again Imperial put
Kings into bat. Kings got of to a lying
start scoring 56 of of the irst four
overs. his did involve Dave getting
bored so he decided it would be more
fun to bowl to irst slip rather than
the batsman on numerous occasions
and ended up bowling 18 balls for
two overs. Furthermore, because it
was obvious that Imperial were going
to win Karan decided to drop both
openers early on just to make the
game seem more interesting.
Eventually ICUCC managed to
dismiss the top three and then we
were well and truly into the tail. Dave
managed to get the crowd on his side
by taking a spectacular one handed
catch on the boundary and then
proceeding to down a can given to
him, leading to everyone chanting his
name.
Imperial eventually managed to
restrict Kings to 126. Special mention
to Tom for bowling an excellent spell
taking four wickets for nine runs.
In reply Imperial got of to a
solid start with a strong opening
partnership of 61 which included a
cool, calm and collected half century
by Vishal whilst Hemant just stood
by and watched. Both eventually lost
their wicket which brought in Viggy
and Sam.
Sam however also lost his wicket
cheaply which brought in crowd
favourite ENNY Scott (Dave), who
pleased the crowd by smashing it
round the park and taking us home.
Batting Figures:
Vishal: 54
Dave: 38
Viggy: 28

Tom: 4-0-9-4
Viggy: 4-0-11-2

Attack of the Stormtroopers – London Cricket Varsity 2014

IC CRICkET
On a day in which the Weather Gods
inally answered Arvind Rajagopalan’s
nightly prayers and granted us a day
of fun in the sun, seconds skipper
Samuel Mead led ICUCC onto the
pitch for our irst ever Varsity match
against the Medics seconds at Regents
Park. Based on some sneaky insider
information, sent to him the night
before by Arvind, Sam elected to ield
irst. Imperial was chomping at the
bit, ready to sink our teeth into the
star-studded Medics batting line up
featuring two of their 1st XI batsmen,
the opener being the 1st XI Captain,
the mighty Mrigank Sinha.
Nick Young was right on the money
from ball one, keeping Mrigank irmly
on the back foot by making good use
of the bouncy astroturf wicket. Sam
Mead at the other end proceeded to
bowl the worst opening spell in recent
history. hankfully, it turned out
Sam Mead had also led us out onto
the wrong pitch (a U15 pitch), and
therefore very ‘graciously’ ofered to
restart the match, since the Medics
were concerned that they had only
scored one boundary of the opening
ive overs.
Having restarted the match, Sam
inally decided to pack his leg side
ield and bowl, which turned out to
be a masterstroke since he was intent
on bowling Big G Bodyline, only a
little slower and less threatening.
Soon a mini battle ensued between
Mrigank and Arvind at point, putting
on a virtuoso ielding performance by
stopping nearly every one of Mrigank’s
shots through that region without
even using his hands. Sam, having
inally realised the plan, brought in
the dangerous Mak Gill and set the
straight ielders deep. With the point-
cover region taken out of the equation
by Arvind’s massive behind and Nick’s
excellent long barrier, Mrigank had no
choice but to loft one straight, which
was calmly collected at long on by
Arjun Jayaswal.
With Mak having been removed by
one of the two specialist batsmen in
the Medic line up, IC upped the ante to
try and roll the Medics over for a sub-
par score. More tidy bowling by Mak
delivered him the scalp of the second
opener, who had the distinction of
being clean bowled twice in the same
day. Mak inished with solid igures of
2-16, removing the set batsmen. From
the other end, Arvind was unlucky not
to pick up a wicket with his eclectic
mix of leggies, googlies and sliders,
seeing as Huzaifah behind the stumps
had not quite gotten his act together
yet, missing a few tough stumping
chances. Former IC seconds stalwart
Yash Verma somehow managed
to survive a monstrous over from
Arvind, which ended up going for just
one.
Having decided the game was
meandering along for far too long,
Sam brought on team mascot Hemant
“Habib Habibu” Morjaria, the man
with the golden arm of late, who
instantly brought Huzaifah back into
the game with two stumpings in two
balls, one of them being the dangerous
Jai Patel.
From the other end, “Big Ben”
Stockton proved that sometimes
height is all you need, giving the Medic
batsmen some sweet chin music of a
ive step run-up.
Aseem Sharma (aka “traitor”)
was the beneiciary of most of this
hostility. Hemant managed to prise
out two more Medic batsmen (with a
third stumping for Huzaifah), but was
denied a ive-for by Sam. With Ben’s
wicket inally getting IC into the tail,
Sam decided to unleash our secret
weapon, Luke Gardner.
Luke proceeded to prove just how
quick he had become, sacriicing
line, length and the pitch for pure,
brutal pace. He proceeded to give up
20 runs before some timely words
from Arvind resulted in his maiden
wicket for IC, a fact which was not
lost on anyone when Luke went for
an ecstatic gambol around the pitch.
Arvind inally contributed to the
wickets column, running out the
Medic’s seconds Captain, setting IC a
tricky target of the nelson, 111, in 20
overs.
With darkness threatening to
bring an early end to the day’s play,
Imperial openers Hemant and Big
Sam Dethridge proceeded to cut into
the Medics bowling. he irst 10 overs
were negotiated quite comfortably.
Despite the early hiccup, Hemant
continued in his ine vein of form,
before falling caught-and-bowled to
Medics legspinner Samad Wahid. In
walked Arjun Jayaswal, signalling his
murderous intent early by arriving
without a helmet. It seemed the
Medics took the philosophy of caring
for your fellow man quite literally,
refusing to bowl at the stumps for fear
of causing injury, resulting in a very
charitable dose of extras and cutting
down our target by a good third. Luke
“Skywalker” Gardner very astutely
predicted that the Medic bowlers
would manage a better run-rate than
their batsmen did, as turned out to
be the case. Arjun eventually fell
to Medics skipper Jonny Wise for a
quickire 18 of six balls, killing what
little hopes the medics had left. Fahad
Ali, the “Medic with a mouth” was
not shy with his atrocious sledging,
but even his own team could not take
someone playing in a white tank top
and black trousers seriously. As for
us, we were wondering when PB had
started playing for the Medics (yes,
the sledging was of THAT quality).
With Huzaifah walking in at no. 4,
Sam entrenched at that other end and
only nine runs left to knock of, the
only real problem left for IC was that
Huzaifah did not have enough runs
left to get to leave contented. With the
last ball of an excellent Yash Verma
(who really should have been brought
on earlier) over to face, Huzaifah
unfortunately could not build on a
good day behind the stumps, playing
all around an in-dipper, leaving for a
golden duck to the plumbest of plumb
LBWs. He was later quoted as saying
“I was so eager for a single to keep
strike that I missed the ball.”
hankfully, Big Sam Dethridge
realised the danger of leaving any runs
for the skipper, and promptly clubbed
two boundaries to inish of the game,
giving IC a resounding win.
