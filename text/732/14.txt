A s one figment of my
imagination once said to
another "there's sod all to
do half way to nowhere" a
comment which seems to
go someway toward
s u m m i n g up this point in
the year. All the initial
enthusiasm seems to be
petering out as thoughts
turn to exam preparation
followed by summer
holidays or jobs. This is
where you begin to suss
how apathetic and boring
college can really be. Most
of you are probably
hanging around in your
own little groups of friends,
going out to the same sort
of places and not bothering
too m u c h about looking for
something radically
different—all fair e n o u g h in
its own way I suppose.
Fittingly this year's 'total
hype' group Sick Sick
Sputnick, or however y o u
pronounce it, have c h o s e n
this time to release their
debut single. Having
already devoted too much
s p a c e to it I'll just say that
it actually appears to be
Giorgio M o r o n or s o m e o n e
and has a title about 'love
missiles' which seems like
it might have been pinched
from the spoof film 'Spinal
Tap'.
If y o u intend to write a
c o l u m n about alternatives
to work, it seems to me you
should try and understand
something about the
student psychology.
Personally I must confess
I'm still struggling in this
field—at the moment things
seem to run along the lines
of 'labs and problem sheets
are so tedious, boring and
unimaginative that any old
gore movie is likely to be
more mentally stimulating'.
In fact the more I think
about it the more I c o m e to
the c o n c l u s i o n that the
worst thing about C o l l e g e
is that there is an
underlying tendancy to
drive peoples thoughts
away from reality.
Before I get carried away
with c o l u m n s about us all
suffering from mass mental
illness I think I'll skip
straight to the point (calling
your readers a bunch of
nutters is poor house style
anyway).
Occasionally even the
dullest undergraduates can
show a potential for
concern about greater
things than their starting
salary (who wants to
employ a boring yuppie
engineer w h o s e sole
interest is bank balance
collecting anyway?). While
you all sit there
comfortably folding this
page into a paper dart to
lob at your poor innocent
maths lecturer millions of
other poor innocents
around the world are being
terrorised, persecuted,
exploited and tortured by
governments less
restrained than ours (and
you thought governments
were there to take care of
you). T h e H u m a n R a c e
learns very slowly from its
mistakes. But oppertunities
to learn from history
a b o u n d in L o n d o n . O n e of
the best documentaries of
how tyranny affects
ordinary people was the
writing of A n n e Frank who
was a victim of a regime
w h o s e hideousness was
made unique from many
others past and present
mainly by the scale of its
horror. There is an A n n e
Frank exhibition at the Mall
galleries, Pall Mall until
M a r c h 2. Entrance is,
appropriately for the
circumstances of many of
us, free.
While I'm in a 'self-nihlist'
m o o d I think I'll move on to
music. Punk may be dead
but that's no reason to
avoid live gigs where the
emphasis is on gut
wrenching power and
vitriolic vocal contortions
(what a pretentious little
phrase). T h e S w e d i s h
group Leather Nun last
toured this country some
years ago with T h r o b b i n g
Gristle, when they b e c a m e
notorious for leaving a trail
of riots. They return this
Tuesday 25 to play at the
Bull & Gate, Kentish T o w n ,
with Z o d i a c Mindwarp &
the Love Reaction. C o s t is
£3 for what should be an
O T T gig.
Having hyped Half M a n
Half Biscuit it would be a
bit hypocritical to slag
them now, especially
before I've actually heard
all of their new E P , T h e
Trumpton Riots. But all the
same Nigel, Neil and the
boys appear to be having a
tough time following up
their initial spark of genius.
If y o u want to get in on the
C a m b e r w i c k Green punk
cult then you can see them
at Dingwalls on Thursday
27 -personally I think it's a
cruddy little hole of a club.
In fact, in general, I'd much
rather go to a pub venue
than most of the L o n d o n
clubs - not only is the beer
less likely to be expensive
fizzy water, but at the Bull
& Gate for instance the
actual room itself is better.
B o u n c e r s from the police
state s c h o o l of audience
subjugation are a big put
off at c l u b s too (the worst
ones always wear bow ties
like those at the C r o y d o n
Underground). Small pub
gigs can be a good night
out and all the g o o d bands
started small once. T h e
range is so vast that the
best suggestion I can make
is to check the music
papers or Time Out. O n e
gig I'm going to personally
is T w i c e Bitten at the
Pearly King, Bromley-by-
B o w , on Thursday M a r c h
16. This is a very g o o d folk
venue and brews some
excellent beer on the
premises. I've got to be
careful not to forget the
union bar if I'm talking
about beer, maybe Sean
will get some Irish folk
music for the next
promotional evening.
Can't think of any droll
throwaway quotes to end
this week's speil, and
anyway they take away all
the seriousness. But I've
observed that the best films
are always meaningful or
stylish and are often re-run
at the Scala. This all
applies to A p o c a l y p s e N o w
and Dr. Strangelove two
films I go to see there
whenever I can. But what
puzzles me is who goes to
see all the old Russ Meyer
flicks they run like 'Beneath
the Valley of the Leather
clad N y m p h e t s with B i g
Knockers'. In the words of
Herbert D. R o s s the little
known blind U S director of
the early 70s "I don't see
what its all about ".
