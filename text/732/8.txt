FILM
Agnes of G o d is an excellent
film. The introduction to the
characters is indicative of
Norman Jenison's intelligent
control of character a n d plot.
Meg Tilly is brilliant as the
innocent nun, Sister Agnes,
accused of murdering her baby.
Her introduction is first through
her pure and piercing religious
singing and then visually
shrouded in a heavenly light
(one of the many fine examples
of photographer Sven Nykvist's
contributions). The protective
Mother Superior, Ann Bancroft,
is first seen disdainfully
observing the psychiatrist, Jane
Fonda, and then smiling away
and confessing to a former
smoking habit in excess of Ms
Fonda's 'Two packs a
day...unfiltered'. Jane Fonda
once again plays her usual
character, an independent,
determined woman who doesn't
get pushed around by anyone.
The tranquility of the convent
is shattered first by the
childbirth screams of Agnes and
then by the subsequent
discovery of a strangled baby in
her locked room. Jane Fonda, Dr
Livingston, is appointed by the
court to determine whether
Agnes is mentally fit to stand
trial. This then leads her into
conflict with the Mother Superior
who resents the probing and
godless methods of psychiatry
and who fears that Dr
Livingston's investigations will
drive Agnes away from G o d . She
also comes into conflict with the
Bishop and the court authorities
who want a quick and clean trial
and who appear to have little
sympathy for Agnes.
One of the great strengths of
this film is the ambivalent
relationship between the Mother
Superior and the psychiatrist
whose background contains
many reasons to resent the
oppressive and guilt-ridden
nature of Catholicism. Another
strength is the stunning
performance of Meg Tilly who
makes a thoroughly convincing
and worryingly impressive loony.
She is a complete innocent
whose early life was severely
corrupted and whose education
was terminated by her insane
mother. She has little knowledge
of body development and
regards the growth of breasts as
a tendency to flab and that this
should be combatted by starving
herself to the thinness that she
sees in all the religious icons
around her. She has come to
believe that 'suffering is
beautiful' and that ' G o d hates fat
people'. Her innocence also
leads her to believe very peculiar
things about the origins of
babies. The direction by Norman
Jenison is simple and
uncluttered but yet very skilled
with some wonderful set pieces
such as the hy|. .osis scene with
the ever present oppressive
Catholicism symbolised by the
large cross above Agnes. It is
probably the best film so far this
year, and probably one of the
best of the year.
On a completely different tack
is another film to come out this
week, C o m m a n d o . In spite of
ending with 'o' like M a c h o or
Rambo it is a good film. What
saves it from being the standard
macho military machine against
the evil thousands is the
strength of the female
characters. They are there not
simply as sex or love interests or
merely to be rescued or avenged
for, but are strong capable
characters essential to the
development of the plot. The
other strong point in this film's
favour is it's sense of humour; it
is deliberately very funny in
parts.
Colonel John Matrix, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, is the former
leader of an elite military squad
who were instrumental in
deposing an evil dictator and
installing a democratic
government in a South American
country. The aforementioned
dictator then conspires to kidnap
Matrix's daughter in order to
D'H
L A W R E N C E
Lady Chatterley's
Lover
persuade him to assist the
dictator regain power. Of course
Arnold is having none of this....
The humour in the film is
largely introduced through the
wonderful Rae Dawn C h o n g who
plays a stewardess, initially an
unwilling, but finally a useful
and resourceful ally to-Arnold.
She is not only very witty but
also intelligent and capable,
including saving his life.
The ending is the usual one
man against impossible odds,
but the film does at least take
time to develop another side to
Matrix's character, that of the
loving father, and this is done
pretty well by Arnold. A further
plus for the film is the lack of
politics, the baddies are not bad
because they have the wrong
ideology but because they have
decidely anti-social habits.
Anyway, I enjoyed it.
This is a good week for films.
Another film that opened
recently is the astonishing
Streetwise, a documentary about
kids living on the streets of
Seattle, Gateway to Alaska. If
you didn't see it for yourself you
would find the situation these
children are in wholly
unbelievable.
The documentary reveals
some incredible attitudes
amongst the kids for their
parents, 'They're part of my past'
Kim, 16, and the parents for their
kids. 'It's a phase she's going
through' says a mother about
her prostitute daughter who is
picking up clients before her
first period.
The film contains some great
music (though not enough) by
Tom Waits and a wonderful
version of 'Teddy Bears Picnic'
by Baby Gramps. Though the
film is open to the well founded
charge of voyeurism, it is made
with honesty and sympathy and
the presentation of the material
(92 minutes from 56 hours of
film and 26 hours of interviews)
shows a genuine concern for the
plight of the children, and is a
credit to the cameraman,
director Martin Bell and editor
Nancy Baker.
It is always compelling,
sometimes funny and sometimes
tearfully poignant, take a deep
breath and go and see it.

Being given a copy of Lady
Chatterley's Lover for Valentines
Day, I decided to review it for all
you love/lust (delete as
applicable) hungry IC students.
It really is remarkable how by
defying convention a mediocre
book such as this receives the
adulation worthy of a work of
genius—which it certainly isn't.
Perhaps his early death gave
him his mystical popularity.
The story is about the
aristocratic Constance having an
affair with Mellors, her disabled
husband's gamekeeper, getting
pregnant and leaving her stately
home. This is all fairly
predictable but doesn't quite
come off especially at the end
when the plot telescopes
somewhat—in fact the book is
downright boring, despite the
relatively rare 'juicy bits' that
generations of voyeurs have
rummaged for.
Throughout this book I had
the impression that D H
Lawrence was a misogynist of
the highest calibre—women
should be seen and not heard,
and certainly not have an
orgasm unless their (male)
sexual partner is having one at
the same time. Whatever the
dubious wisdom of two people
who hardly knew each other
having sex, 'Lady Chatterley'
showed women as primarily for
mens' gratification, which
reveals him to be as narrow
minded as the so-called
Victorian prudes.
It's late in the year, and there's
no grant left, but college food is
inedible and the kitchens
covered in grease and moving
fur balls. Solution—take the
bank manager out for a meal at
Le Bistingo and let her/him pay.
Unlike the Stockpot (behind
Harrods) or the Kwality Curry
House (near South Ken station),
Le Bistingo isn't the cheapest of
nutrient retail businesses. Its
about £10-£15 per head but you
get what you pay for, which can
be 3/4 courses of exquisite
French food plus wine—and the
portions aren't mingy either.
On my last visit my partner
and I tucked into fried
mushrooms—deliciously light
and crisp with a sharp tartare
sauce, then I followed with an
overcooked duck with orange
sauce—the only blight on the
meal, while my friend ate a small
veal escalope. On a previous
occasion I enjoyed a large dish
of Boeuf Bourguignon (fancy
stew and rice) which was very
tasty. We didn't fancy anything
on the sweet trolley, but the
large glasses of ice cream, nuts
and chocolate we finished with
were a fitting complement to the
meal.
Le Bistingo has a small
selection of fairly good
wines—the house white at £3.95
a bottle was crisp and kind to
the palate, and the service was
unobtrusive and friendly. You
can find this pleasant little den,
which is very romantic with
flowers and candles on the
tables, on Old Brompton Road,
just South of South Kensington
Station.
