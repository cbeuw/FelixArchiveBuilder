Five-a-side
Although reeling from
sensational tabloid
disclosures alleging that
four of the IC squad had
been found vanquishing in
the gutter outside Durham's
trendiest night-club, c o a c h
Rob Clarke's footballing
elite still managed to
stumble their way to the
semi-finals of last Sunday's
tournament, before
admitting defeat in order to
catch the last train home.
Hangovers were lifted
early on as Dave Lynne
maintaining a scoring run
which had begun the
.previous night, put IC
ahead in the opening group
game v Bradford. H o p e s of
a g o o d start were d a s h e d ,
however when Bradford
equalised with the last kick
of the game; the headaches
and dry mouths s o o n
returned.
U W I S T proved a tough
nut to crack in the s e c o n d
game, as c h a n c e s c a m e
and went, and another
stalemate seemed likely
when tragedy struck.
Engberg was harshly
adjudged to have
encroached into his own
area, and the resultant
penalty, clinically
despatched, plunged IC
deep into a crisis.
Fearing his job was on
the line, Rob Clarke
pressed the panic button
and rang the changes,
dropping top-scorer Lynne
and the ever-popular but
strangely leg-weary (?!)
Goldsworthy for the final
group match. His
controversial moves looked
to be vindicated when Alex
Lunghi fired home a beauty
only for the pressures of
management to return as
Nottingham equalised
against the run of play.
With the title slipping away,
IC's travelling support
turned spitefully on the
beleagured Clarke, and
calls for his head grew
deafening. Engberg
realising his managers'
desperate plight,
bludgeoned his way
through three tackles, and
with the referee's whistle
poised for action, crashed
the ball into the roof of the
net for a sensational
winner.
Sneaking through one
goal difference, IC were
paired with Birmingham in
the quarter-finals. An ashen
faced Barnes kept his
place, much to the disgust
of the still axed
Goldsworthy, although
Lynne was restored to add
some much needed charm
to the front line. T w o quick
goals from our latter day
Romeo killed the tie as a
spectacle and the
entertainment value was
not aided by the 2nd half
appearance of stopper
Clarke in order to protect
the precious lead. With
only home favourites
Durham now standing
between IC and a coveted
final spot, the talk was of
glory a n d medals a n d beer
until it was discovered that
another win would mean a
night on the snow-covered
c o b b l e s of Tyneside.
C o m m o n sense prevailed
and the Oxbridge rejects
were gifted a couple of
simple strikes, thereby
handing L o u g h b o r o u g h an
easier than expected ride in
the final. The Sports
scientists were no doubt
relieved that their most
dangerous opponents had
by that time boarded the
6.37 to L o n d o n King's
Cross, safe in tne
knowledge that the
inhabitants of Durham were1
glad to see the back of :
them.
Boat
Henley Fours Head
Imperial C o l l e g e Boat C l u b
picked up another two wins
at the weekend and were
close to winning several
other divisions. T h e Elite
c o x e d four having broken
their fin and rudder on the
way to the start required
Bill M a s o n to make hasty
repairs Despite this and
starting out of position they
won their division weaving
their way through many
slower crews. T h e other
win c a m e for the senior A
C o x l e s s four. Both Senior
B c o x l e s s a n d Novice
c o x e d fours c a m e s e c o n d
in their divisions.
The overall position of the
top two crews is most
encouraging as they were
only beaten by a Leander
crew racing on the home
water.

Sports Centre
Are you making the most use
of the Sports Centre?
It makes a nice change to
write about a facility for
students that has not only
increased its service, but
also maintained the same
student prices since
1983/84! Hopefully, this
article will inspire more
students at IC to use the
Sports Centre, and thus
ensure that prices stay low.
Currently it costs 30p for a
student to have a swim or
use the multigym. Half an
hour of squash costs 60p!
Whilst these facts may be
known to many of you, you
may not be aware that:
• T h e Sports Centre is fully
open on S u n d a y mornings
from 9.00-12.30, (recently
there have been empty
squash courts!)
• T h e r e is early morning
swimming from 7.30-8.30
on Wednesday mornings.
