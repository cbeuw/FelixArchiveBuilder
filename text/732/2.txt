E d 11 o f i a
Sabbaticals
Carl Burgess was wrong to
go to the S o u t h s i d e
meeting on S u n d a y drunk.
He was there as a student
representative. He was
there to c o n v i n c e
Southside residents that he
was supporting their efforts
to improve Southside
security. Unfortunately his
performance disillusioned
them.
Having said this, on
M o n d a y morning C a r l ,
realised his mistake. H e
knew he could not resign
because this late in the
year nobody would take on
the responsibility of being
President. He did the only 1
thing he could do, which
was to apologise to
everyone c o n c e r n e d .
Hopefully, by doing this he
will regain people's
confidence. It is quite brave
to admit blame and Carl
has done this. I hope he
gets some credit for doing
so.
If anyone else wants to
be a sabbatical c o m e and
see me as soon as possible
as I have to advise you
about producing publicity.

Southside: The
Apologies
Dear Hugh,
May I take this opportunity
to apologise to all those
concerned for allowing the
Southside security meeting
to collapse into a state of
disarray on S u n d a y
evening. The only reason I
offered to chair the meeting
was I thought it would
make it easier for Ian to put
forward his views if not in
the chair. O n reflection it
was obviously wrong to
attempt to chair the
meeting as I do U G M ' s . we
all make mistakes!
I would like however to
use this space to
congratulate Ian on the
hard work he has
undertaken in an attempt to
better Security in
Southside. T h e lack of
Security in Southside has
been of concern to me
during my three years as
Subwarden of Falmouth-
K e o g h Hall and I can
assure all residents that
'any moves to improve the
situation have my full
backing.
â€¢'Yours apologetically

|On Sunday, 16th February,
I attended a meeting with
various Southside residents
concerning the security in
Southside. T h e meeting
was at 9.00pm and I regret
to say I turned up more
than somewhat inebriated.
Having been reminded of
the meeting earlier during
the day, after I had started
drinking, I should then
have taken the decision not
to attend the meeting.
Unfortunately I did not take
that decision and s o made
a m i s t a k e *
I have been informed that
many people were upset
over my conduct at the
meeting, and so I should
like to take this opportunity
to apologise to them. I
should also like to explain
that the security situation
in Southside has been fully
investigated and plans are
under way to increase the
security there.
There have been many
problems in the past and
we have tried this time to
c o m e up with a viable
solution. If anyone would
like to c o m e and see me to
discuss this or any other
matter please feel free to
do so.

Dear Mr Southey,
I speak for a large number
of IC students when I say
that, frankly, we're getting
bored stiff by some of the
material which has been
appearing in the FELIX
'letters' pages recently.
S o m e FELIX H a c k s think
they're being amazingly
funny by slagging off other
people without having the
guts to sign their names at
the bottom, preferring to
use some pseudo-comical .
'Star Trek' names instead.
J a m e s E Kirk (Captain
Kirk?) who wouldn't wear a
tie to a 'Crazy Tie' party,
seems to me the sort of
person who would go to a
1920's party in a pink toga
and to a vicars and tarts
party wearing motor-cycle
leathers. The garbage that
'Spock' and 'James E Kirk'
have been writing is the
sort of drivel most IC
students sneer at with utter
contempt, so I'm sure we'll
all heave a sigh of relief
when we stop seeing it.
Yours sincerely,
Alastair Seymour

Southside: The
Complaints
Dear Sir,
We have just returned from
a meeting of the
committees of Southside
Halls. It was called by Mr
Ian Howgate of Falmouth-
K e o g h and was to c o n c e r n
Security in Southside, a
problem of great
importance to those who
live here.
It is the feeling of the
undersigned that the
performance of the Union
representative present
should be brought to the
attention of the students of
Imperial.
The meeting proceeded
with speed and efficiency
under the chairmanship of
Mr Howgate, until Mr
Burgess and Mr Hendy
arrived late and under the
influence of alcohol. T h e
best that could be said of
Mr Burgess was that he
could still walk.
There to all intents and
purposes the meeting
stopped, as these two
gentlemen took control,
ousting Mr Howgate from
the chair.
Mr Burgess gave us a
long spiel on his virtues as
a representative of IC
students, containing what
must by the quote of the
century'., no one ever
notices what I do'.
Following this he attempted
to keep 'bloody order' by
preventing those with valid
points from making them.
Mr Hendy the new
chairman was noted as
stopping the meeting seven
times to ask the same
simple question, 'Does
anyone present feel
satisfied with security in
Southside?' on the last
occasion he was answered
with a resounding ' N O ! ' Mr
Howgate left saying the
meeting would reconvene
later as he walked out in
disgust.
The last point from the
floor was 'could the
President Please be sober
at the next meeting?' A
sentiment echoed by many
of the assembled students.
This point may not have
made the minutes as the
meeting could be said to
have closed, because we
were all leaving.
If Mr Burgess would wish
to truly represent IC
Students, then perhaps he
should arrive on time and
in a state in which he could
remember the night before,
the morning after.
We hope that he, or the
Union, would act on this
observation and think that
not only should the union
officials (especially the
President) represent the
students but should also be
representative of the
students.
If Mr Burgess feels that
he was in a fit state to
represent the Union at a
meeting of students, then
perhaps both the Union
and the students of
Imperial should consider
raising the standards of
their President's behaviour,
or seriously consider
electing s o m e o n e who's
