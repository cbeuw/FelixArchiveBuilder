Barclays: Supporting Apartheid
At a recent U G M , a motion on Barclays was due to be
debated before a quorum was called. Sean Dunlop and
Hugh Rubin look at the reasons why Barclays should be
boycotted.
In South Africa, a country
of e n o r m o u s natural
wealth, most black people
live in conditions of
extreme poverty, while the
small white population
enjoys o n e of the highest
living standards in the
world. In all walks of life-
h o u s i n g , e d u c a t i o n , health,
etc the facilities available to
black South Africans are
vastly inferior to those
enjoyed by their white
countrymen.
This injustice is possible
b e c a u s e black S o u t h
Africans are denied all
political rights a n d power.
Their organsations are
outlawed, their protest
brutally s u p p r e s s e d , a n d
their leaders imprisoned,
tortured a n d o c c a s i o n a l l y
murdered by the security
forces. T h e apartheid
system has been
c o n d e m n e d by the United
Nations as a ' C r i m e against
humanity'.
In the present 'state of
emergency', over 900
people have died, the vast
majority killed by poi.~e
and army. Over 15,000
people were detained
without trial; up to 80% of
w h o m are believed to have
been subjected to physical
or p s y c h o l o g i c a l torture. In
Namibia, w h i c h is illegally
o c c u p i e d by S o u t h Africa,
the practice of torture by
the 100,000 strong S o u t h
African army of o c c u p a t i o n
on prisoners is also
widespread.
The survival of apartheid
is not d u e solely to the
massive repression by the
security forces;
multinational corporations
and especially the
international banks, also
have their part to play.
Several British banks play
an important part in this,
especially Barclays, a n d the
merchant bank Standard
Chartered (although
Barclays has by far the
biggest stake of the t w o ) .
Barclays is the only British
High Street bank with a
major stake in S o u t h Africa.
Barclays, via its S o u t h
African subsidiary B a r c l a y s
National, controls 30% of
all banking in S o u t h Africa,
and is the largest single
bank there—its assets
c o m e to a staggering £6
billion, including over £145
million in government
securities
T h e bank has taken part
in massive loans to the
S o u t h African government
and to state corporations
including, in 1980, a £280m
loan to E S C O M , the state
electricity corporation,
w h i c h h a s recently
constructed a £560 million
nuclear power station.
In 1976, Barclays
purchased £6 million of
G o v e r n m e n t Defence
B o n d s , thereby directly
supporting the South
African armed forces,
although it was forced to
sell them a year later after
an international outcry.
This is not the only link
that Barclays has had with
"Why doesa
NationalServiceman
need a bank?"
the South African Military:-
Until it was d i s b a n d e d in
1982, the C h a i r m a n of
Barclays National w a s a
member of the South
African Defence Advisory
Board, which advised the
a r m e d forces o n arms
procurement. T h e bank has
also helped finance arms
sales to South Africa,
although the bank says
unknowingly.
A l t h o u g h S o u t h Africa's
continued o c c u p a t i o n s of
N a m i b i a is illegal
(according to the U N a n d
the International Court),
Barclays displays its
acceptance of the
o c c u p a t i o n by operating
there; In fact Barclays
controls half of all bank
deposits taken in N a m i b i a .
F r o m this central role in the
Namibian e c o n o m y ,
Barclays plays a key part in
channelling profits from the
country to South Africa-in
1978 Barclays directed 18%
of its deposits taken in
Namibia there.
Barclays insists that its
continued presence in
Southern A f r i c a is a
liberalising influence o n the
aparteid regime, a n d is
beneficial to the black
community. However, the
bank receives more m o n e y
from the black c o m m u n i t y
than is returned to it in the
form of loans or
investments; thereby
reinforcing the e c o n o m i c
barrier that apartheid
effects. Also, a poll
c o n d u c t e d by G a l l u p last
s u m m e r found that 7% of
black South Africans
supported international
sanctions against their
country.
In 1981, Barclays w a s
named by the U N a s o n e of
the main multinationals
making a 'substantial
contribution to apartheid'.
B e c a u s e of its
involvement in South
Africa, Barclays has been
banned from many
university c a m p u s e s .
However, o n several
o c c a s i o n s last year (in
FELIX, the I C U H a n d b o o k
and P H O E N I X ) I C U printed
full page adverts for
Barclays Bank. W e think IC
students should be
d i s c o u r a g e d from opening
a c c o u n t s with a bank w h i c h
is supporting, financally, a
country whose constitution
is based o n a system of
institutionalised racism. F o r
those reason, a motion
calling on the U n i o n to
cease to print adverts for
Barclays Bank has been
submitted for d i s c u s s i o n at
the U G M o n 6 M a r c h . W e
hope y o u will c o m e a n d
support the motion.
