A Public School
Snob Writes...
Dear Sir,
Whilst the '3rd year
C o m p u t i n g Undergraduate'
has s o m e interesting
acerbic c o m m e n t s to make
on innocent M S c students,
I would have thought it
better for him to withhold
his scurrilous rantings from
the otherwise relatively
sane pages of FELIX. His
sort of snide, underhand
c o m m e n t s should be
reserved for s u c h gutter-
press organs as ' R C S
Broadsheet'.
In my opinion (which is
unfortunately biased as I
a m from public school) the
'old boys' are the only ones
who do really k n o w how
things should be done.
Contrary to popular belief
we are not s n o b s or gay.
We have manners (which
the C o m p u t i n g
undergraduates obviously
lacks), most of us are
reasonable public speakers
(unlike the U n i o n
executives), most of us
have talents in other fields
apart from jus' s c i e n c e and
we are prepared to work to
improve ourselves and the
reputation of our college,
rather than letting it be
dragged d o w n to the level
of the insufferable 3rd year
C o m p u t e r Scientist. Let us
have no more of their
inverted snobbery!
Yours faithfully,
Physics Undergraduate

Dear Sir,
T h e observation by the 3rd
year C o m p u t i n g
Undergraduate is
absolutely correct. I a m an
M S c computing student
myself and I have seen
M S c Postgraduate students
who think that they have
the making of a politician
by the swagger and display
they put into their
'questions'.
Fortunately, I happen to
fall into the alternative
description of M S c
students: 'Most M S c ' s are
great guys/women...'. A s
s u c h I would like to advise
3rd year C o m p u t i n g
Undergraduate to be more
circumspect in his
categorising IC student
population into 3 distinct
groups because by a single
example and one fell stroke
of his pen, he has
c o n s i g n e d all M S c ' s to
eternal infamy. After all, all
opinions are like arseholes-
everybody has one.
Yours sincerely,

Moonie Blues
Part 2
Dear H u g h ,
I read M i k e B a l c o m b ' s
letter in last weeks FELIX
with some interest, noting
in particular his extensive
use of one study as proof
that his organisation
( C A R P ) is not the ogre
'Moonie Blues' makes it out
to be.
Having twice read Dr
Barber's book 'The M a k i n g
of a Moonie' (there's no
need to spend Â£12, as there
is a c o p y in the Haldane
Library) I would like to
share a few observations.
Dr Barber was 'chosen'
by the Unification C h u r c h
to c o n d u c t her studys as
she was unlikely to be
biased against the c h u r c h
at the start. This is not
meant to suggest that
funding c a m e for within the
Unification Movement
(infact, the S S R C footed
m u c h of the bill), but it
must be borne in mind that
it was the M o o n i e s who
asked Eileen Barber to
investigate their
organsation. While she was
not a U C member, she had
had s o m e contact with
them, and had not
appeared to be
unsympathetic.
'The making of a M o o n i e '
covers quite extensively
receiving technique (as
observed), b u t , quite
rightly draws c o n c l u s i o n s
only as far as the volume of
evidence permits. T h e
evidence came partly from
first-hand experience in a
number of unification
centres and partly from
questionaires and
interviews with past and
present (then) U C
members. Needless to say,
the current members were,
to man, adament that they
had not been brainwashed.
S o m e of the 'leavers' had
different ideas. M r
B a l c o m b s suggestion that
allegations of brainwashing
have been discontinued is,
of course, indefensible
(Witness FELIX, 31 2 86)
If time permitted, it would
be tempting to discuss the
political activities of the U C
and the morality of the
unification concept of
'Divine Deception'.
However, in c o n c l u s i o n I
would rather remind
readers that, while C A R P ,
the Unifcation c h u r c h , the
Holy Spirit Association for
Unification of world
Christianity, and all the
other related organisations
may, legally speaking be
quite separate they have in
c o m m o n the policies,
principles a n d aims of the
Rev S u n M y u n g M o o n .
Yours sincerely,
Alastair Macleod
Letters are all very well but
how do you write to a few
hundred (thousand) people
all at o n c e and in an
engaging and witty manner
too? I mean, writing hurts,
it hurts me at least. A n d ,
don't only mean in the
mental way, I find my hand
is lifeless, my arm dullened
after only a few pages of
longhand struggle. I can't
type, know no shorthand
and even if I could pay
s o m e b o d y to do it all for
me I probably wouldn't
because I'm a mean
bastard. Or I would be if I
had any money to be mean
with. There, I've used mean
4, no 5 times already. Rest
assured gentle reader, it
wouldn't happen if I had a
decent vocabulary. That I
place the blame for on my
English teachers of
yesterday. A n d a bit before
that as well. G r a m m a r
wasn't spoken of, weekly
spelling tests were in and
very little else. A few years
a g o a w o m a n w h o used to
live next door to us
c o m m e n t e d to my mother
on how well-spoken I now
was 'and him having been
in remedial English class
too!' I was outraged at this
slur on my ability, I've
never been remedial in my
life, the cheek of it all. N o w
here I am and I feel
extremely, well, remedial. A
girl at a party last week
introduced me to
s o m e b o d y as 'the guy who
is quite g o o d at tennis but
shit at computing'. A life's
ambition crushed in the
hands of a 6 foot a m a z o n
with the a c c u r a c y of a
striking cobra. A n d she
doesn't know how bad I am
at tennis as well. Recently
I've been grappling with a
sense of inadequacy not
seen since Walter Mitty. In
my dreams I am a
successful person.
S u c c e s s f u l in society's
terms; something in my
waking moments I profess
to shun. A woolgathering
wooly-principled
backslider. I can't think of a
word meaning back slider
that begins with a 'w'.
W h e n I leave this altar of
learning, no doubt with
something to show for it, I
shall do if not my utmost
then certainly quite a lot to
forget what little, I have
assimilated. A theology
student once remarked to
me on the little known fact
that in his opinion
computing was the most
senseless (and useless)
degree subject out. Had I
been quick of mind and
nimble of tongue I would
no doubt have retorted that
the study of ancient
religions, c o m p a r i s o n of
modern ones and theology
in general isn't my idea of a
relevent subject either. But
there you are. Still, I hope.
There I mean. A n d there
still is that 4-letter word, I
don't seem to know of a
better one. A letter in an
old technology S u n d a y
newspaper from a s u b -
editor on a new one who is
not only ashamed of his
action (of staying on the
staff) but not brave e n o u g h
to leave struck me as
curiously strong. Able to
put his name to a letter of
s u c h force and clarity as he
did, abusing himself in the
national press, perhaps he
is one of a growing number
of people equipped with
the skills to survive in an
age, and a Britain, long
gone past, never I think to
return. I don't b e m o a n its
loss or wish for it to return,
merely that what replaced it
hasn't turned out to be all
that it promised to be.
