Ladders
My friend M o b i u s is a
dedicated puzzle fanatic.
S o addicted is he in fact,
that he continually invents
puzzles from everyday
situations (much to my
annoyance). The other day,
for example, he told me
that on his way to college
he was walking down a
small alleyway behind his
house The alleyway was 5
feet wide. T w o ladders
were placed so that each
ladder touched the base of
the opposite wall to that
which it was leaning on,
and they both leaned
against different walls. O n e
ladder was 16 feet long, the
other 11 feet long. What
M o b i u s wanted to know
was; could he, walking in a
straight line parrellel to the
alleyway, walk under both
ladders without bumping
his head (Mobius is
extremely unsuperstitous
and will purposely walk
under ladders in defiance
of supernatural forces)?
M o b i u s wouldn't tell me the
answer, he said it wasn't
very difficult and I should
do it myself. But he did say
that I shouldn't take into
account the width of his
head or the ladders. C a n
y o u tell me what answer he
got? By the way, M o b i u s is
5 feet 11 inches tall.
R a n d o m l y selected
winner will receive £5.
A n s w e r s plus c o m m e n t etc
to the FELIX office by
Tuesday lunchtime please.
It seems that the problem I
set a few weeks ago, tricky
triangles, first appeared in .
FELIX four years ago, in
Martin S Taylor's excellent
S C A R A M O U C H E C o l u m n .
B e i n g quite a clever puzzle-
it probably got passed
around until it reached me,
so the credit should go to
Martin. N o n e of the few
w h o entered knew this,
though, so no harm done.
What's interesting is that,
back in 1982 Martin got
eleven correct entries,
while I only got five
solutions in total! Has
inflation so reduced the
value of £5 since 1982?
Actually I've been a bit .
disappointed generally with
the response to s o m e of my
more interesting problems.
M y preference is towards
inspirational type problems
that need a flash of insight
to solve, rather than the
slog it out permutation
type, but the latter
invariably get a better
response. Please let me
know what you prefer, or
whether you think the
problems are too hard.

Barbara sent Neil's card
Christine sent Pete's card
Diana sent Luke's card
Elizabeth sent Mike's card
A n d r e a was Pete's sister.
I got eleven entries which
were all correct so you
obviously found this quite
easy. T h e random winner
was Richard Squire, Elec

Pennies
Well, even with last week's
clues I still received no
entries to this problem
pity, since I thought it
quite an interesting on
and not too difficult. I
you thought about it,
anyway. Here's what I
made of it.
C o n s i d e r drawing a line
d o w n the centre of the
table, then, when your
opponent puts a coin d o w n
somewhere, you put yours
in exactly the s a m e point
but reflected in the centre
line.
This means that at any
point during the game the
pattern of coins will be
symmetric around the
centre line, and you will
always be able to put a
coin down opposite your
opponent's coin until there
are no gaps left.

these,

Obviously this only works
if a) your opponent never
puts a coin on the centre
line, and , b) your
opponent goes first. T h u s it
is not very satisfactory. T h e
next refinement is to draw
two perpendicular centre
thus exploiting the
complete symmetry of the
table. The problem here is
that the centre point does
not move, so if your
opponent's coin overlaps
the centre you won't be
able to put yours in the
reflected position. Still, this
strategy always works if
you go first (since you can
nab the centre position and
then follow the old
strategy) and will probably
work if you go s e c o n d , as
long as your opponent
never puts his coin over the
middle of the table.
This is as far as I could
get with this one. If this
inspires you to think of any
better strategies, please let
me know.
