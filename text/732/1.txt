Southside Security
Improvements
New security measures will be
installed in Southside following
a campaign by Ian Howgate, a
concerned student.
The Students Residence
Committee, the College
Committee that controls
residences, has decided that
security lodges will be built at
the East and West entrances to
Southside. O n e entrance will be
manned by a messenger during
the day and both will be manned
after 10pm. Magnetic locks will
be introduced and lockable post
boxes will be installed.
Tizard Hall Committee have
asked Dr Henry Hutchinson,
warden of Tizard Hall, to
recommend to the Chief
Security Officer, that bedroom
looks are replaced and extra
Security personel employed.
Mr Howgate commented 'As
far as I'm concerned the
proposals are good proposals,
but they must go the whole way'.
He estimates that the cost of
manning both doors throughout
the day will be sixtyfive pence
per week per person in
residence in Princess G a r d e n * .
IC Union President Carl
Burgess told FELIX that he
Ian Howgate
thought the proposals were
good. He said though that
security could be improved if the
guards checked the Union Cards
of people entering Southside. He
pointed out that valuables had
been stolen from locked rooms
by people who appeared to have
stolen keys. A Union card check
would in his view result in these
people being caught. He
admitted that such a check
would be a nuisance to
Wacky Field Cup
This year's Field Cup is reported to have been a tremendous
success. A Guilds' spokesman stated that lots of 'very silly' things
were done, in a generally boisterous and high-spirited atmosphere:
'You'd be surprised what people will do to their bodies if they
think they'll.get points for it,' he said.
It was claimed that the best-selling drink of the evening was a
pint of bitter, liberally doused with curry powder, while for two of
the revellers, sharing a 'willy-warmer' was seen to be the right way
to pass the time.
Southside residents, but said
that residents would have to
decide whether they wanted
convenience or security.
Mr Burgess also suggested
that an alarm should be put on
the entrance to the tunnels
under Southside.
The Managing Surveyor of
Residences, Peter Hallworth told
FELIX that the modifications
would 'hopefully be complete by
the start of Summer term'.
Apology
IC Union President, Carl
Burgess, has apologised to
Southside residents after
disrupting on open meeting on
security by turning drunk.
The meeting had been called
by Ian Howgate, a Falmouth
Keogh resident who has*
campaigned about security in
Southside, so that residents
could draw up proposals for
improving security. Mr Howgate
opened the meeting by outlining
the problems.
Mr Burgess arrived late in an
inebriated state with Chris
Hendy, Falmouth Keogh
subwarden. Mr Hendy then took
the chair and Mr Burgess started
making speeches and prevented
Mr Howgate speaking.
Eventually Mr Howgate lead a
walkout by residents when he
decided that discussion was
impossible.
Mr Burgess wrote a letter to
FELIX on Monday lunchtime
apologising for his behaviour
and he also apologised to Union
Council-for bringing the Union
into disrepute.
