Hack Race 1
Dave Kingston, IC Union
Deputy President has
announced that he will be
contending the post of U L U
President. Mr Kingston
believes that he can
improve the Union's
standing with the University
of London and the
Government.
He is unhappy with the
poor image U L U has
presented in the past,
particularly with its
response to the
Governments green paper,
'Education in the 1990s'. 'A
student body which doesn't
reason and argue clearly is
a waste of time', he added.
Mr Kingston is anxious to
increase the public's
awareness of the problems
facing students. He feels
that his work in the General
Union C o u n c i l and his
experience as a sabbatical
at IC will stand him in good
stead.
IC Welfare Officer Pete
Wilson will be running for
Science and Engineering
Senator at U L U . Mr Wilson
aims to encourage the
broadening of Science
curricula, and the
improvement of Computing
and Maths sub-courses. He
is also very keen to make
the U L U Executive less
remote for students at
Imperial.
'I have a closer contact
with 'more' Science and
Engineering courses than
students of other Colleges'
he said.
Shattered
Between Â£150-200 of
damage was done when the
window of the Southside
shop was smashed on
Tuesday evening. The three
people concerned had been
participating earlier in the
Guilds' Field C u p . They
were found immediately by
the security guard, and
were interviewed by Mr
Reeves of College Security.
One of them was suffering
from cuts to the face,
hands and leg; all three
claimed that they had
sustained these injuries
after slipping on the steps
in front of the shop and
falling through the window.
Although Mr Reeves said
he was inclined to believe
their story, the security
guard involved said that he
thought the incident was
no accident, and reported
that as he arrived on the
scene, he saw the injured
student kicking at the
already shattered shop
front. Mr Reeves is
investigating the matter
further. No one was
available in the Guilds'
Office for comment.
Discipline
Sections of the proposed
new College Disciplinary
Regulations were rejected
by ICU Council, meeting
on Monday evening at the
College Field Station.
Silwood Park.
The draft of the new
regulations allowed the
penalty imposed on
students found guility of
misconduct to be increased
on appeal. Several
members of Council spoke
out strongly against
accepting this, saying that
it was 'contrary to natural
justice'. The present
regulations do not allow
the appeal panel to
increase the penalty, only
to confirm or reduce it. The
new code was drafted by
Michael Arthur, former
Student Services Officer
and now Assistant College
Secretary.
Council amended the
draft changing the
offending phrase so that
the penalty may not be
increased on appeal. The
new regulations must be
agreed by the Union before
they can be adopted, so the
objections are likely to be
accepted by the College.
Surrealist Rocks
There will be an exhibition
of drawings and paintings
by J o h n Davidson in the
Consort Gallery from
Tuesday 25th February
until Friday 21st March.
The exhibition entitled
The Chamonix Series
contains pictures from the
Chamonix area in the
French Alps.
The exhibition has been
organised by College
Safety Officer Dr G o r d o n
Hargreaves. He described
the paintings as tending
towards a 'surreal
interpretation'.
Dr Hargreaves collects
paintings himself and first
came across Mr Davidson's
work at the Artists' Market
in Covent Garden. This
venue, which no longer
exists, gave unknown
artists the opportunity to
show their work. Dr
Hargreaves said he tries to
keep the styles and subject
matters of the exhibitions
in College as varied as
possible. He said that they
were usually well attended.
No Confidence
The University of London
Union avoided a vote of no
confidence on Tuesday at
General Union Council.
Royal Holloway and
Bedford New College
Students' Union had
originally proposed the
motion. After talking to the
Executive they decided to
withdraw the motion. The
U L U constitution, though,
meant that they were
unable to do this. The
Executive proposed an
amendment praising their
performance. O n a vote,
the amendment was
accepted. The motion,
though, was rejected.
At the same meeting an
anti-racism motion was
passed although an
amendment that would
have resulted in U L U
adopting a 'no platform for
racism' policy was rejected.
