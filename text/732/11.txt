The day started bleakly at
'5.00am at Beit and
continued right up to the
end of the day at 8.30pm
outside Aero. The days
events were dominated by
the van. S o m e
inconsiderate and probably
pissed Bastard from C & G
had chundered in the van
and it stank. The journey to
Brunei was not bad, the
roads were clear but Capt
Bridger's driving left .
something to be desired.
Due to some excellent
navigation by Le Poisson
we arrived half an hour
early and picked our 7th
man up from Uxbridge
station before returning to
the ground. It took the
umpires about 45 minutes
to fix the pitch before we
took on the professional
Brunei side. Capt Bridger
batted well in the face of
tight bowling and fielding
to return with 25. King and
Devon were out quickly
then Turner and Wright
batted well as did Bridger
on his return. Hammer was
run out without facing as
IC closed on 125 for 5 from
12 overs. The bowling did
not match up to the batting
as Brunei knocked the runs
off for the loss of two
wickets with an over to
spare. Hammer being the
only bowler to c o m e out
with any credit as he
bowled his 3 overs for only
16 runs. After a quick visit
to Pizza Hut in Uxbridge,
we watched Brunei paste
East Anglia. We then took
on Surrey. The early
bowling of Wright and
Devon restricted Surrey but
later on with some smiling
they scored freely against
Bridger and Turner, so
close on 112 for 4 from 12
overs. IC responded in fine
fashion with Fish and
Devon striking the ball well
with Fish scoring the
fastest 25 of the day from
only 11 balls in 3 overs
including a 6. In the middle
IC crumbled a bit with
Devon, King and Turner
getting out in quick
succession. Bridger and
Wright then took the score
to 102 with 10 needed from
2 overs. Bridger was run
out followed by Wright who
stood and watched when
he should have run. This
left Fish to score 7 on his
own. A 3 followed a 2 and
with 3 balls to go he was
run out leaving Surrey
winners by 2 runs. Brunei

pasted Surrey and IC vs
U E A was just academic. IC
reversed the order and
failed badly to get all out
for 55. U E A were in some
difficulty at 20 for 3 but
then they scored 18
(including) 2 sixes in the
only over from Le Poisson
and then they won by 2
wickets. All one hopes for
is that we play far better
ouside in the S u m m e r U A U

Following a slow start to
the new year the water-
polo squad had begun to
rediscover some of the
skills that took them to the
U A U Finals to be held at
Shrewsbury at the end of
the month.
An early defeat by a
stronger heavy side that
lost to Imperial last term
did nothing for our morale
and the absence of two key
players didn't help. After
two matches were
cancelled due to opposition

pulling out at the last
moment a subdued team
recorded their first win of
1986 in a difficult match
against the Womens
National League champions
Potters Bar Ladies.
The return of A n d y
Langman to midfield told in
our following match against
Selworth which Imperial
won 10-7. Although still not
100% fit our players
controlled most of the
possession during the
game. However defensive
errors allowed several goals
against us, mistakes which
were not in evidence in
December when Imperial's
marking was made tighter.
Last Friday saw the
return of Steve Davis after
protracted glandular fever
and his two goals early in
the first quarter contributed
to our unfortunate win
against a less fit Avondale
side. Although the game
was quite slowpaced
Imperial's defence seemed
much safer with stalwort
work from Johnston and
Eastman. Passing also was
quicker and more accurate
in the midfield with good
work in particular from
Paul Richardson although
he still could use faster and
more accurate service from
his wingers Williams and
Ireland.

The latest London Colleges
League race was held on a
building site somewhere
near Surrey University.
Having home advantage,
Surrey managed to run out
their stars, and hence
closed the gap on us at the
top of the League. This was
despite a good run by
Bryan Gamblin, excelling in
his natural habitat of knee-
deep mud.
Keele was this year's
venue for the B S S F
Championships. The team
arrived more or less intact
due to the excellent driving
of J o n , 'was that a bridge'
Lea. IC provided half the
L o n d o n University team,
which finished a creditable
5th in B U S F , while the
college team came 15th in
U A U , boosted by a rare
appearence of little Mike (is
that the right way round?)
Ball. Further entertainment
was provided on the return
journey when a new
method of windscreen
cleaning (or was it a novel
type of circuit training) was
tried by his holiness Pope
John.
