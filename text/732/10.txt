Boat Club
Last Saturday saw the Boat
C l u b racing for the first
time this year in open
competition. IC had eight
crews entered in the
Henley Heads of the River
in a field of 160.
Both the elite c o x e d and
senior coxless fours won
their divisions by
impressive margins and
came s e c o n d and third
respectively overall, losing
only to the elite leauder
coxless four. Although
those were the only two
wins of the day for IC, the
other crews came well up
in the ranking. T h e two
senior B coxless fours
came s e c o n d and fourth in
their division, the faster
crew only losing by two
seconds. T h e senior C
coxed four c a m e eighth in
their division, won by Kjngs
College, L o n d o n .
The Novice squad who
only began rowing this
year, entered two fours and
came s e c o n d and seventh
in their division, the 'A'
crew only losing by seven
s e c o n d s to a crew in a far
superior boat and after
being held up by another
boat. The womens' novice
coxed four, again racing in
open competition for the
first time, c a m e fourth.
These results are very
encouraging for the future,
especially as the top two
crews now c o m b i n e to form
the first VIII, going on to
race the likes of Oxford
and C a m b r i d g e .
Biochem Soc
After a term of clandestine
meetings in seedy cafes. A
term of gathering under
hazy electric light reflected
from yellowing wallpaper.
Tired fanatics pass briefly
on frosty station platforms
to hand over grubby
messages.
W h o are these people?
What is this strange
underground society? Well
the time has c o m e for the
truth to be brought to light.
The Imperial C o l l e g e
Biochemical Society
(previously known as the
Biochemistry Liberation
Front) proudly and loudly
presents its lecture of the
year, kindly sponsored by
the B i o c h e m i c a l Society, is
to be held in the Pippard
Lecture Theatre on
Thursday Feb 27 at 1.00pm
and is entitled ' P h e r e m o n e s
and H u m a n Interaction'. It
will add a whole new
meaning to your ideas of
body language and perhaps
explain the mystery of why
some people wear Brut 33!
S o for those of you who
have missed out on our
events so far be there, for
this one (no secret h a n d -
shakes necessary).
Cycling Club
O K then, where were you
all last S u n d a y ? In bed
probably. Three people met
at 10.00am for the weekly
C y c l i n g C l u b S u n d a y run,
and we decided
unanimously to zip d o w n
the A 3 . Off we set, did we
have a headwind? It
certainly felt like the wind
was against us but we
nevertheless managed to
keep up a fair pace. T h e
original plan was to pay the
inhabitants of Dorking a
short visit, but after we
missed the turning, we
ended up in Guildford
where Mars Bars and C o k e
were the order of the day.
The trip back was difficult,
as we found out that we
were now cycling into a
fairly strong windâ€”we had
the wind behind us on the
way there! However, we still
arrived back in South
Kensington just after
2.00pm.
C o m e on all you cyclists!
Make 10.00am next S u n d a y
a date for a cycle ride its
not that early, and anyway
the fresh air is certain to
wake you up pretty quickly.
P S M a y 24th is a date to
keep free for the B i c y c l e
Belle-a delightful trip
through the C o t s w o l d s with
a massive tea afterwards.
For more details turn up on
Thursday, 12.30, Southside
Upper Lounge.

S&G
I have written this article
because the paper has
been decidedly weak on
S & G trips recently. S o for
all you poor students out
there c o o p e d up in bedsits
and flats studiously putting
your all into your work
here's a breath of the
S n o w d o n i a air. Yet another
glimpse of that wonderful
freedom that everyone w h o
has a stout pair of legs,
waterproof clothing, strong
boots, a map, torch and
c o m p a s s and the will to get
away from it all can
experience.
Unfortunately S n o w d o n i a
trips with S & G always fall
into the same pattern, and
after 3 years, its b e c o m i n g
a bit boring. First on
Saturday there's a crowd
ready to attempt the
S n o w d o n horsehose, seven
of the finest upland miles in
Great Britain, wonderful
scenery and a truly
enjoyable walk, but is it still
enjoyable when everyone
goes for it everytime? I
know I don't enjoy c r o w d s ,
especially on Crib G o c h
when half of them are
c o m i n g towards y o u . T h e
knife edge b e c o m e s tricky
then, so as happens most
years a small contingent
(about 12 of us, forty were
on the trip), headed for
Tryfan and the Glydyrs.
Again an enjoyable
scramble with s o m e good
walking. This time though
the weather was against us,
too windy by half and
dangerous as Tryfan was
covered in ice. Nine of us
came down after getting
three quarters of the way
up, approximately 2700 feet
above sea level. We had
taken the North ridge but
found it too icy nearer the
top. In years past
Saturdays groups have
headed for the C a r n e d d s
(Kevin and Pete in 1985)
but I have never heard of
anyone going for Moel
Siabod (2860) G R 708545,
Elidir Fawr (3030) G R

Attempts could be made for

widen your experience,
dont just rely soley on
tradition.
It's g o o d fun and most
people enjoy it. C o m e on,
liven it up. D o some more
exploring, give it a try!

Firmly clutching his loofah,
the writer wondered what
to do next. He knew what
he would like to do next.
But, he mused, it was
probably illegal and
anyway the nearest farm
was miles away. His early
morning reverie was
disturbed by a stoat flying
in through the bathroom
w i n d o w and stricking him
c i a r p l y on the cranium.
Retrieving the
unfortunately beast from
the washbasin, the writer
found a note tied around its
neck. Written in green
crayon, the note read as
follows: K U M T O T H E
N E C K S T Q T M E A T I N G O R
I'LL KIK Y O R H E D INN'
S o m e of the writing was
joined up, he noted
appraisingly, that must
have taken the C h a i r m a n
hours.
Arriving at the meeting
early, the writer was met by
the irate chairman. The
latter was, as always,
immaculately dressed,
sporting a three piece suit
of finest red striped
wallpaper, complete with
matching c h e q u e b o o k .
'Now look', began the
chairman, 'you have missed
three meetings in a row.
Any more of this
absenteeism and I shall
have to take away your
executive perks.'
S u c h as?' Inquired the
writer. 'Use of the executive
ashtray' snapped the
chairman, who frequently
snapped under pressure. At
this the writer became pale
and silent, and listened
attentively while the group
planned an arson attack on
the Albert Hall 'just for a
laff. The following morning
the stoat registered with
B U P A .
