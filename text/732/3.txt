Dear F E L I X ,
O n S u n d a y evening I
attended a meeting of
S o u t h s i d e residents in
F a l m o u t h - K e o g h to d i s c u s s
widespread c o n c e r n over
security arrangements. T h e
meeting had been called by
Ian Howgate, a F a l m o u t h -
K e o g h resident w h o had
d o n e a survey on the extent
of thefts from rooms a n d
mail racks. T h e object of
the meeting was to have
been for Ian to present his
view of the problem to
interested students a n d to
canvas for suggestions. I
understand Ian had
c o n s u l t e d the S o u t h s i d e
wardens about the p r o b l e m
a n d that they had agreed
that this s h o u l d be a
residents c a m p a i g n
independent of the
wardens, w h o have been
making their o w n efforts on
the subject for sometime.
Carl B u r g e s s , as
president of the U n i o n , had
been invited to attend to
listen to the residents case.
H o w e v e r Mr B u r g e s s
arrived obviously s o m e w h a t
inebriated and p r o c e e d e d
to interrupt Ian a n d a n y o n e
else w h o s p o k e , to ramble
incoherently about h o w
c a p a b l e he was a n d to slag
off those e x p r e s s i n g
c o n c e r n . T h e situation w a s
made no better by C h r i s
H e n d y , F a l m o u t h - K e o g h
s u b w a r d e n , w h o offered to
help Ian by chairing the
meeting. Unfortunately Mr
B u r g e s s was allowed to
continue making a fool of
himself and no attempt was
really made to let Ian put
his c a s e before a
d i s c u s s i o n was started. T o
be fair the situation w a s not
helped by two other people
present w h o s e e m e d intent
on c h a l l e n g i n g every trivial
point, but in a short period
of time people w h o s h o u l d
k n o w better had c a u s e d an
important meeting to
degenerate to a farce. At
this point Ian led a walk out
by most of the residents
present.
S o u t h s i d e security is a
very serious issue, it is a
problem that has been
allowed to c o n t i n u e far too
long. W h e n people w h o are
s u p p o s e d to represent us,
and I really mean Carl
Burgess, behave like total
wally's over matters w h i c h
were obviously of c o n c e r n
to a large n u m b e r of people
it is time to worry. Mr
B u r g e s s was intent on
insisting that the matter be
left to him but how, can we
frankly be expected to trust
in Carl when he is totally
incapable of s h o w i n g
ordinary students that he is
trustworthy. S o m e may say
that it is too late in the year
to think about votes of no
c o n f i d e n c e , but the
situation c a n n o t be allowed
to c o n t i n u e without s o m e
c o m m e n t . It is important
that people w h o get elected
s h o u l d not be allowed to
think that they c a n n o t be
held responsible for their
i n c o m p e t e n c e , a n d I for
o n e w o u l d support a
motion c e n s u r i n g C a r l
B u r g e s s for his stupid
behaviour.

Dear F E L I X ,
T h i s evening at Falmouth
K e o g h Hall, we attended a
meeting c o n c e r n i n g the
state of security in the halls
of residence.
It is a matter of c o m m o n
k n o w l e d g e that at present
s c a r c e l y a day passes
without s o m e e x a m p l e of
a b y s m a l neglect in this
area. During recent w e e k s
residents' mail has been
repeatedly stolen, m a c h i n e s
vandalised etc. W e
d i s c o v e r e d today, that only
on Friday two r o o m s within
the S o u t h s i d e c o m p l e x
were entered, probably with

keys w h i c h are freely
available to all a n d sundry,

of c a m e r a e q u i p m e n t w a s

1.15pm at w h i c h time the
resident was taking a

At the meeting, the
attitude displayed by the
