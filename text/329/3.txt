C years on...
This year marks the 10th anniver-
sary of the British Universities North
A m e r i c a Club. T h e C l u b started life
as the University of London Canada
Club back in 1 9 6 2 , a n d B U N A C w a s
formed the following year to expand
the cultural a n d travel possibilities
of the U . L . C . C . into a national club
for a l l university students, with
branches at each University. B y the
end of its first year of existence,
B U N A C h a d s o m e 3 , 0 0 0 members
and had operated its first transatlan-
tic flight programme of 11 flights.
From the start it w a s felt that for
the Club to be successful, it w o u l d
be better if it d i d not run its o w n
travel programme, but h a d an agent
to run it. This w o u l d avoid B U N A C
having too strong an image of a travel
club, a n d allow it to concentrate
more on purely C l u b activities. T h e
B U N A C flight programme w a s then,
as n o w , handled by B . S . T . C . Ltd., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bri-
tish Universities Student Travel A s -
sociation ( B U S T A ) w h i c h is a non-
profit educational charity a n d w h o s e
surpluses are directed towards stu-
dent travel scholarships.
During the 1 9 6 0 ' s B U N A C ' s m e m -
bership soared a n d its flight pro-
gramme expanded so that by the e n d
of the decade its annual member-
ship w a s regularly approaching
2 0 , 0 0 0 . This caused something of a
problem for the flight programme be-
cause as an affinity group, the C l u b ' s
charters were limited by a Civil A v i a -
tion Board's rulings of a 2 0 , 0 0 0 mem-
bership limit a n d a " 6 months' m e m -
bership before y o u c a n f l y " restric-
tion.
A c c o r d i n g l y , B.S.T.C., w h i c h by
then h a d moved into the European
Student Flights business, obtained
permission for B U N A C to operate its
transatlantic charters on the same
basis as those of European flights.
This benefited the student in three
ways. First of a l l , he d i d not have
to be a club member for 6 m o n t h s —
he could join today a n d fly tomor-
row. Secondly, he didn't have to be
an actual University student — a n y
student between 16 a n d 3 0 w a s eli-
gible. Finally, he w a s no longer tied
to a fixed outward a n d return date
package, but could choose h i s East
and West-bound flights separately to
suit his particular plans.
Certainly no one c a n accuse
B U N A C of not trying their utmost to
live up to their slogan a n d " m a k e
America p o s s i b l e " for British students
to visit with the m i n i m u m of cost and
fuss. Over 6 0 , 0 0 0 members have
flown B U N A C over the last ten years
and helped them gain a n excellent
reputation for reliability in the sector
of student travel.
O.K. B i g Deal. B u t h o w does
B U N A C operate a n d what does it of-
fer the student?
B U N A C operates on t w o levels —
nationally a n d at college or univer-
sity level.
On a national scale, B U N A C h a s
its headquarters in London at 4 6 Char-
lotte Street, where it employs a s m a l l ,
full-time staff. They ensure that the
college North A m e r i c a Clubs are kept
supplied with membership cards,
handbooks, publicity, etc., a n d they
also d o the running of the C l u b ' s
services such as B U N A C A M P , a s u m -
mer c a m p counselling scheme; the
B U N A C E X C H A N G E VISITOR P R O -
G R A M M E , w h i c h enables students to
get a summer work visa for the U S A ;
and the B U N A C E M P L O Y M E N T S E R -
V I C E , w h i c h fixes up guaranteed jobs
in the summer vac. for those students
who are unable to find a job for
themselves a n d w o u l d otherwise not
go to the U S .
A l l policy decisions regarding
B U N A C are made solely b y a National
Committee, c o m p o s e d entirely of
students a n d elected annually from
representatives of the various North
A m e r i c a Clubs around the country.
This ensures that B U N A C ' s services
are kept in touch with what students
want a n d c a n afford, i.e. it is run by
students for the benefit of students.
A t a University level, the voluntary
N A C committees are responsible for
recruiting members a n d encouraging
interest in North A m e r i c a by holding
film shows, talks, etc., a n d by being
available to answer m e m b e r s ' ques-
tions on travel, employment, a n d the
like. I.C. has h a d its o w n North
A m e r i c a C l u b for s o m e years n o w ,
and those w i s h i n g to find out about
travel to A m e r i c a or interested in
helping to run the C l u b are asked
to contact Chris Gibbs ( W e e k s 8 4 )
or B o b Evans (Tizard 1 5 4 ) . I C N A C
urgently needs helpers.
Finally a w o r d or t w o about some
of the services B U N A C are operat-
ing for 1 9 7 3 : —
(1) 1 9 7 3 Flight Programme.
T h i s year the student h a s the
choice of over 1 0 0 flights to N e w
York, Los Angeles, S a n Francisco,
Toronto or Vancouver, departing from
either London. Belfast, B i r m i n g h a m ,
Manchester or Prestwick. H e also
has the choice of booking a student
flight, or a n A B C ( A d v a n c e Booking
Charter) flight for a f e w pounds less,
although o n s o m e routes only A B C
flights operate.
A B C charters are being introduced
this year a n d w i l l be the only sort
of charter allowed in future. Briefly,
the advantages of A B C flights are
that they are cheaper a n d are not sub-
ject to any eligibility restrictions. This
means that a student c a n n o w take
his parents or girlfriend (who perhaps
is not a student) to the States at a
low price whereas for student flights
only h u s b a n d s / w i v e s c a n accompany
the student. T h e drawback to A B C
flights is that they must be booked
three months in advance, whereas
student flights c a n be booked right
up to the last minute.
Return flights to N e w York start
at £58 ( A B C ) or £62 (student
flight). These rates are fully c o m -
petitive with, if not cheaper than,
rates offered anywhere »Ise, espe-
cially since they include s u c h extras
as free drinks a n d meals on the
flights, hotel a c c o m m o d a t i o n in North
A m e r i c a on the night of arrival, plus
transport from airport to hotel, air-
port taxes, and a copy of the " S t u d e n t
Guide to North A m e r i c a " .
Students c a n rely on B U N A C ' s re-
putation for reliability, especially this
year with the airline carrier being
almost exclusively Panam.
(2) Bunacamp
T h i s programme is a i m e d at those
who enjoy the outdoor life but m a y b e
cannot afford to shell out the money
for flight. G r e y h o u n d pass, etc., be-
fore departure. T h e scheme offers a n
eight-week job as a counsellor in an
A m e r i c a n children's s u m m e r camp.
A l l the student has to pay is cm £8
registration fee, a n d B u n a c a m p pays
for h i s flight, transport to the camp,
board a n d lodgings a n d a m i n i m u m
of $ 1 7 5 pocket money.
There are still s o m e vacancies for
instructors in certain sports — con-
tact IC N A C for more details, but
hurry as lists close shortly.
(3) Exchange Visitor Programme
For those w h o d o not fancy c a m p -
counselling there is the E V P , operated
by B U N A C in conjunction with the
US-based C o u n c i l of International
Educational Exchange.
A d m i s s i o n to this programme gives
the student a J l visa w h i c h enables
him to take any form of paid employ-
ment i n the U . S . a n d thus makes a
summer vacation in A m e r i c a finan-
cially viable.
Every year over 3 , 0 0 0 users of the
programme discover that working for
about 8 weeks a n d travelling around
for about 4 w e e k s need only cost
them the same as a fortnight's holiday
in Europe.
M a n y wait until after arrival in the
States to find a job, buf for those
w h o don't Wish to d o this there is
always the B U N A C J o b Directory.
(IC N A C are hoping to arrange a
talk about the E V P on Thursday, Feb-
ruary 2 2 ) .
