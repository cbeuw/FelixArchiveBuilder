THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS
The Significance of Population G r o w t h
In my last article I
said that the root cause
of the environmental
crisis was that industrial
civilisation has adopted
an ideal, that of non-stop
economic growth, which
has now become un-
workable owing to the
m a t e r i a l limitations
placed upon us by the
planet on which we live.
However, while resource
shortages and pollution
problems will be the
factors which most dir-
ectly affect the devel-
oped countries of the
world, the poorer na-
tions will find that a
third problem, that of
population growth, will
in most cases be their
major headache. This is
because their popula-
tions are growing much
more quickly than those
of the developed coun-
tries. The population
"doubling - times" of
most 'developing' coun-
tries are now about 20-
35 years, whilst for the
developed countries they
are in the region of 60-
100 years. That means
that a country such as
Kenya with a doubling-
time of 23 years, has, in
this short period, to
double its food-produc-
tion, its housing, its
schools, hospitals, roads
and all its other ameni-
ties and necessities
MERELY IN ORDER T O
PREVENT ITS PEOPLE'S
S T A N D A R D S O F LIVING
F R O M DETERIORAT-
ING.
A s far as food is con-
cerned, an idea w h i c h
seems to have gained
popularity lately is that
the 'green revolution'
has solved a l l the
w o r l d ' s problems for the
foreseeable future. Noth-
ing c o u l d be further from
the truth. A l l it does is to
a l l o w a short breathing
space in the struggle to
feed the w o r l d ' s grow-
ing population. If use is
not made of this to re-
d u c e the rate of growth
by a significant amount,
w e w i l l merely find our-
selves confronted in a
short while with the
same problem on a lar-
ger scale.
The limitations of the
green revolution fall into
two classes, the ' h u m a n '
and t h e 'material'. T h e
latter stem from the
simple fact that y o u
can't produce extra food
out of nothing! In order
to achieve the high
yields obtainable from
the new strains of wheat
and rice, the plants
must have plenty of
water and a liberal dose
of fertiliser. Thus unless
political a n d e c o n o m i c
circumstances allow a
good supply of the latter
and provision of a good
supply of the former (un-
less irrigation c a n be
used) advantages of
growing 'super - wheat'
are nil. T h e only differ-
ence between crop-fail-
ure with the ordinary
grain varieties and with
the 'super' varieties is
that in the latter case
more people are likely to
starve as a result. Real
benefit c a n only be o b -
tained from t h e green
revolution if the neces-
sary proportions of the
increase in yield is
stockpiled for use in a
year when the crop fails.
Grave e c o n o m i c a n d
human problems also ar-
ise as a result of the
green revolution. These
mostly stem from the
fact that growing a crop
of 'super-wheat' requires
a higher initial invest-
ment than for ordinary
wheat, partly because
the seed is more expen-
sive and partly because
of the cost of the fertil-
iser. Hence those w h o
are rich enough to make
the investment (or obtain
a bank loan) c a n make
good use of the n e w
varieties, whilst the
poorer people c a n often
find themselves worse
off than they were be-
fore, if they rely on sell-
ing part of their crop to
pay for their other neces-
sities. Other problems
can occur as a result of
the higher price of the
seed for the new strains;
for example, adultera-
tion of the seed with that
of ordinary varieties by
corrupt merchants or
government officials. It
is a l l very well for the
comfortable, well - fed
scientists of the indus-
trial w o r l d to sit in their
laboratories a n d 'solve'
the problems of the de-
veloping countries. T o o
often, however, they to-
tally fail to comprehend
what their so-called 'sol-
utions' actually mean in
human terms.
It is frequently point-
ed out that w e w o u l d go
a long way towards solv-
ing the problem of star-
vation just by distribut-
ing more equally the
food w h i c h w e already
have. W h i l e this may be
true at present, there
are several limitations to
this approach. Firstly,
the greater the distance
over w h i c h the food has
to be transported, the
greater the quantity of
resources w h i c h are
used up in the process.
Secondly, where food is
transported across n a -
tional boundaries, politi-
cal problems are liable
to arise. D o w e really,
for example, want to see
a situation in w h i c h
many of the poorer
peoples of the w o r l d
have to depend heavily
on food from North A m -
erica merely to stay
alive? Thirdly, it seems
likely that the part that
redistribution c a n play
in solving the food prob-
lem will d i m i n i s h rapidly
in the longer term. It has
been estimated that if all
the countries of the de-
veloped w o r l d lower
their birth rates to re-
placement level by the
year 2 0 0 0 a n d a l l the
other countries by 2 0 4 0 ,
then the w o r l d popula-
tion will eventually stab-
ilise at some 151 thous-
and m i l l i o n people, over
four times its present
size! Producing food for
even half that number
w i l l be incredibly diffi-
cult. T h e only rational
solution to the problem
seems to be to stabilise
the w o r l d ' s population
as fast as possible. If w e
don't take steps to d o
this ourselves then n a -
ture will s i m p l y d o it for
us.
The most worrying as-
pect of t h e population
problem is perhaps the
question of how m u c h a
decrease in t h e rate of
population growth is i n -
evitably tied to a corres-
ponding increase in the
material standard of liv-
ing. W e k n o w that coun-
tries can go through the
so-called 'demographic
transition' (i.e. achieve a
significant a n d perman-
ent fall in the birth rate)
without having a n y par-
ticularly advanced birth-
control techniques. This
happened in Britain be-
tween about 1 8 7 0 a n d
1 9 3 0 . In such cases the
decrease in birth-rate
has gone hand in hand
with t h e process of i n -
dustrialisation a n d the
rise in the standard of
living. W h a t does not
seem to be clear, how-
ever, is whether a s i m i -
lar transition c a n be
brought about merely by
making available sophis-
ticated family-planning
methods but without a
concomitant improve-
ment in material welfare.
It seems very unlikely
that it can be, unless co-
ercive measures are re-
sorted to, and w h o pre-
cisely is going to c l a i m
the right to tell other
people h o w many c h i l d -
ren they can have?
Thus .the population
problem concerns not
only the underveloped
countries but the de-
veloped ones as w e l l , for
it is the latter w h o by
their excessive material
greed a n d profligate
wastage of resources are
making it m u c h more
difficult for the former to
achieve o n e of the re-
quirements for stabilis-
ing their populations (ie
development). There-
fore, perhaps the main
way in w h i c h the devel-
oped countries can help
solve the population
problem is to decrease
their usage of resources
and make more available
to the rest of the w o r l d .
One of the ways in
w h i c h they can help d o
this is by stabilising, or
even reducing, their own
populations. W h i l e this
will hardly be enough o n
its o w n , as I hope I made
clear in m y last article, it
is certainly one of the
things w h i c h should be
done a n d it is also a
measure w h i c h , in Brit-
ain at least, is likely to
be politically more a c -
ceptable in the short
term than, say, reducing
the per-capita use of re-
sources.

On the workings of
Refectories and
Mr. Mooney's Mind
T H E C O M M I T T E E
H o w is the Refectory
Committee constituted?
See green Blue Book p p
149-151. Thanks Martin.
What does it do?
ft deliberates on all mat-
ters affecting the refecto-
ries and bars (run for the
benefit of members of the
colleges and members of
the Union), although its
sub - committees largely
handle Complaints, F i n -
ance, Refectory bookings,
Bars and the college cel-
lars. T h e Refectory C o m -
mittee is responsible to
the Governing Body.
A recent matter of great
importance is hygiene —
dealing with cockroaches
and mice pie. f personally
think College has, by stu-
dent bureaucrat standards
at least, been incredibly
slow i n dealing with this
problem. But a fairly rig-
orous procedure for clean-
ing and pest control seems
to have been finally adopt-
ed—although not yet offi-
cially by the Refectory
Committee, we shall find
out at the the next meet-
ing. (Of interest here was
a recent story in the Even-
ing News, relating to a fine
on some establishment for
failing to maintain a suffi-
cient standard of hygiene:
the proprietor of a similar
establishment i n the same
street was quoted as saying
that infestation was not
an insuperable problem.
The reason — 'I keep m y
place clean'.)
P R I C E S A N D P O L I C Y
That wholesale prices of
food have risen is not un-
known. But the following
figures might surprise you.
% i n -
Sep Feb crease
Beef 38p 49p 28

L a m b 22p 26p 22
Pork 26p 33p 24
Potatoes 60p 75p 20

The wage bill rose from
£31,043 in the 5 months
to 26/12/71 to £45,726 for
the same period i n 1972.
The basic rate has risen by
12^%, the rest of the in-
crease being from the em-
ployment of more staff in
College Block (with a re-
sultant larger turnover:
how about trying that i n
the Union Refectory?) and
increase management ex-
penses (e.g. last year the
post of Deputy Manager
was vacant for a consider-
able time with conse-
quent saving). So it is seen
that food prices have risen
twice as much as wages.
Now, it is Government
policy that catering should
be self-balancing, i.e. run
on a break-even basis.
With the exception of pub-
lic holidays, the refectories
are run all the year round,
and the trading position
varies with time. Briefly,
the peak trading is Octo-
ber (on arrival of the
freshmen) is the main i n -
put of profit to counteract
the losses made i n the
vacations and the summer
term.
When prices were i n -
creased i n October b y
2£"/o (the grant went up by
a Whole 3%) it was
thought that this would be
a sufficient increase to
break even this year. H o w -
ever the current rate of in-
flation was not foreseen.
So, even if wholesale
prices remain at their pre-
sent level, the Refectories
will lose i n the region of
£9,000 this financial year.

Several things could be
done about this:
1. Part of the loss could
be met from reserves (the
total reserves are not large
enough to cover the loss).
2. The bar profits (difficult
to estimate because of the
effects of V A T ) could be
used to offset part of the
loss instead of refurnish-
ing Southside Bar.
3. T h e entire profits of
the College Cellar might
offset some of the loss.
4. Prices could go up —
Mr. Mooney proposed a
2 5 % increase i n the main
course charges, 2 0 % on
chips and l p on vegetable
servings. ( N B it is M r .
Mooney's duty as Catering
Manager to table this pro-
posal. Don't blame h i m —
to d o so is only side-track-
ing the issue).
What will be done? 2
and 3 are against both col-
lege and Union policy.
The U n i o n reps will cer-
tainly fight any such pro-
posals, and such proposals
are extremely unlikely.
I. Will have to be used in
part.
4. This is the interesting
bit.
Mr. Mooney wrote to
the Ministry regarding the
effects of the 'price
freeze' on the proposed
increases. A copy of the
reply is printed here. N o w
tell me that Phase 2 is not
a wage freeze. Does line 6
of the text mean you can't
raise net profits, or per-
centage profits? Very in-
teresting.
T H E E F F E C T O N
S T U D E N T S
Firstly, I believe prices
are unlikely to be i n -
creased. Secondly, there is
a much broader, and I
think quite clear, conclu-
sion.
Two years ago the N U S
went to the (Conservative)
government asking for
major changes in the struc-
ture (and amount) of
grants. T h e Government
refused to discuss the
major demands, whilst the
token concessions they
made have been described
by the C V C P as 'com-
pletely inadequate.' T h e
Government, however,
said that Universities
should keep down the cost
of accommodation and
meals. However, the coll-
ege have orders from the
Government to make ac-
commodation and refec-
tories, self-financing, and
are bound to do so. V a c a -
tion letting has allowed
Imperials' authorities to
keep accommodation char-
ges reasonably low, but
there is no comparable i n -
come for refectories.
On one hand the U n i -
versity states " W e know
students are in difficulty
but this can only be solved
by the Government giving
larger grants". O n the
other hand the government
states "Grants would be
quite adequate if Univer-
sities kept their prices
down". Both agree there
is something wrong but
neither side will accept the
ultimate responsibility for
the students squeezed i n
the middle.
A C T I O N
We therefore must
choose either to take some
action or become poorer
from year to year — o r
month to month. O n the
question specifically of re-
fectories, I believe that M r .
Mooney has been invited
to the next U G M (which is
an hour before the next
Refectory Committee
meeting). Bring questions
and ideas.
