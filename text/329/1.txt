Tomorrow's National
G r a n t s Demo a s s e m b l e s
Queen's Tower, 12.45
there is a G R A N T S
D E M O tomorrow (Wed-
nesday) by all the colleges
and Universities in the
South-Eastern region.
This is the day of climax
of the grants campaign,
which has so far included
rent strikes and refectory
boycotts all over the coun-
try. Every region in the
British Isles will be hold-
ing a mass demonstration
of unanimity for the N U S
proposals for higher grants
— so it is of vital impor-
tance that y o u come to
Queen's Tower at 12.45
and join the demo, for the
march to the D E S head
office must be well sup-
ported to have the effect
we need.
F r o m Wednesday,
there are only six days un-
til the Government talk
to the N U S , after refusing
for over a year. N o r m a n
St. John Stevas, under-Se-
cretary of state for the
D E S hasn't seen anyone
from the N U S since he
took office, Well, the
Government will hardly
be able to ignore this de-
mo, as we'll be right out-
side their windows.
S P O R T S : — s o that all
sporting students won't
have to face the dilemma
of a muddy pitch or the
demo, the A C C has can-
celled all sports fixtures
except for a few cup and
league games which can-
not be rearranged. Come
along then, and bear in
mind that beer is not one
of those commodities
whose price is fixed by
stage II so if you want to
be able to afford a few
jars i n six month time,
come along and make
sure you get a higher
grant now.
A l l social reps are re-
minded to publicise the
demo on blackboards and
make announcements in
lectures today and tomor-
row.
A t Queen's tower at
12.45 we shall be joined
by the mass contingents of
students from other Usk
colleges. Tickets for the
Underground will be sold
— price 15p — a paltry
sum compared to the £100
p.a. increase we're de-
manding. A t 1.15 the de-
mo will move off to South
Ken, where trains will be
waiting to take us to Rus-
sell Square. W e assemble
in Malet Street and at 2.15
we move off with all the
other colleges in the Sou-
thern region down South-
hampton R o w to the
Kingsway, round the A l d -
wych (legally a demo is a
vehicle and so has to ob-
serve one-way systems)
and across Waterloo
Bridge to the D E S .
The rally after the demo
will be held on the South
Bank near the D E S . Spea-
kers at the rally will be
from a London based
Teachers' Union, the L a -
bour Party, various Trade
Unions and Digby Jacks
(Pres. N U S ) and Judy
Cotter (Pres. U L I E S A ) .
The importance of you
coming to this demo can-
not be underestimated,
because the strength of ar-
guments that the N U S
have in a week's time will
depend a lot on the turn-
out for this demo.

DIRECT
ACTION!
90%
support for
Refectory
Boycotts
Two refectory boycotts have taken place so tar,
both at Southside. They were organised by the U n i o n
executive, (some of them) a n d the grants action com-
mittee, following a (quorate) vote at the union meeting
of February 1 to hold refectory boycotts as part of the
I.C. campaign in support of the N.U.S. grants cam-
paign. A s the time when the negotiations between the
N.U.S. and the D-E.S, are to take place draws closer,
(Feb. 27), it is felt by the grants action committee to
be important that students demonstrate their solidarity
with their leadership.
There were about
twenty Students picketing
students who had intended
to eat i n the refectory, and
on the second occasion
some people stood outside
M e c h E n g to save people
the walk back to College
Block. It is impossible to
assess the exact financial
impact, or to find out the
percentage success in terms
of the number of students,
since M r . Mooney is sup-
pressing certain informa-
tion. I n particular, where-
as before the final till
receipts were rung up after
lunch, as is normal i n any
shop, now the till is cov-
ered up, or the final total,
when read, is replaced by
a row of nines or 50p. But
the people who eat at
Southside regularly (very
UGM LASHES OUT OVER REFECTORY PRICES
Thursday's U n i o n Meet-
ing showed its anger over
refectory prices in sharply-
worded exchanges during
the President's report.
John Lane, I C U President,
reported that M r . Mooney
was asking for a 2 5 % rise
to cover the losses his re-
fectories were likely to i n -
cur this year.
Various members of the
Union told the meeting
that, even though price i n -
creases h a d not been
approved, M r . Mooney
had instructed his staff to
reduce the size of portions
and to charge double if
the portions appear to be
large (even if you haven't
asked for a large portion).
Angry members claimed
that this constituted a
price rise, and were only
quietened o n being told
that refectory prices
would be a major topic
of discussion at the next
Union Meeting on Thurs-
day week.
M r . Mooney has been
invited to this meeting to
state his case a n d to
answer questions, and,
since the U G M comes only
an hour before the
next Refectory Committee
meeting, it is hoped that it
will have some effect.

S T E P S I N
A t the end of January
Mr. Mooney wrote to the
Ministry of Agriculture to
ask clearance to raise
prices under the freeze. In-
formed sources say that
the Ministry replied to the
effect that prices can be
raised to recoup increased
costs of raw materials if
profit margins are not in-
creased, but that since
Mooney's increased turn-
over since 1971 has cov-
ered such increases and
Che profit reduction has
been caused by wage i n -
creases, no increase in
prices would be permis-
sible. T h e Ministry will
not agree to price rises to
cover increased wages
bill's.
F E L I X S U R V E Y
F E L I X is to survey re-
fectories next week for
discrepancies in prices and
quantities, and our report,
Which? Refectory will be
published in next week's
issue. So watch out, M r .
Mooney, Felix's plain-
clothes consumers are
coming!
Chin people, often with
scurvy), estimated 7 0 %
and 9 0 % respectively in
the two boycotts so far.
What is perhaps more
encouraging is that many
people were persuaded by
the pickets to support the
boycotts, by, it must be
pointed out, verbal persua-
sion. M a n y of the people
were not acquainted with
the N.U.S. campaign, and
when they were told, were
totally i n support of a l l
the claims. Most of the
people who did eat were
staff, a n d a lot of M o r -
mons. One of them said
that he d i d support the
claim, and assured us that
God was o n our side, but
he was hungry. O f the stu-
dents who went i n , the
commonest comment was
yes, I support the claim
for increased grants, but
this is not the way to do it.
N o n ; of these students was
at the Union Meeting
which voted for refectory
boycotts. Again, some stu-
dents argued for the
"rights of the individual to
eat where he pleases, that
being democracy." It was
argued that this concept is
wrong. Democracy consists
of supporting the demo-
cratically taken decisions
of a particular organisa-
tion, and i n changing these
decisions within the frame-
work of the organisation.
Students can expect
more lightning boycotts.
A l l the pickets are very
gentle people, and the one
or two people who intend
to walk past the pickets
are urged to stop and
argue the case.
