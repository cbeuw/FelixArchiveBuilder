effeminate boarder, Henry (Kenneth

naive, burly b o o k w o r m w h o h a s just
finished h i s first novel. H e ' s also the
house cook.
Fat these past dozen years, it's
only after meeting T o m in her book-
shop that s h e embarks o n a r e d u c i n g
plan. H i s work h a s taken h i m East for
four m o n t h s ; s h e w i l l surprise h i m
upon h i s return at C h r i s t m a s .
The first a c t is filled w i t h H e n r y ' s
funny, though often snide, remarks o n
her rotund figure. H i s cajoling is i n -
strumental i n keeping her w i l l power
up. H e h a s the best c o m i c lines i n
L o n d o n , w h i l e J a m e s ' are naively
witty.

" T H E R E A L I N S P E C T O R H O U N D "
A N D " A F T E R M A G R I T T E " ( S H A W )
Four years a g o I attended, very
m u c h against m y better judgment, a
play b y a fellow c a l l e d T o m S t o p p a r d .
I h a d not heard of h i m , a n d the name
of the play " T h e Real Inspector
H o u n d " ' hardly s e e m e d inspired
( " M o r e avant-garde r u b b i s h " I
thought). T h e evening t r a n s f o r m e d
me, a n d I have b e c o m e a d e v o t e e of
this writer's b r a n d of h u m o r o u s
obliquity.
The evening at the S h a w starts w i t h
" A f t e r M a g r i t t e " , — a lightweight
play w h i c h opens in the utmost ob-
scurity, w i t h (amongst other s e e m i n g
absurdities) a m a n in w a d e r s telling
a girl in a ball dress about a one-
legged footballer s k i p p i n g a l o n g w i t h
a tottoise under h i s a r m , but carries
through to a c o n c l u s i o n that is a s
utterly logical as it is funny, w i t h a l l
e x p l a i n e d .
" T h e Real Inspector H o u n d " how-
ever, w h i c h forms t h e bulk of the
evening, begins quite reasonably,
w i t h t w o critics, M o o n a n d B i r d b o o t ,
(sic) a w a i t i n g the opening of a W h o -
as s h e w a s before; he is not helping
the " c a u s e " . T h i s friction m a k e s her
more d e t e r m i n e d than ever to remain
s l i m .
The final scene s h o w s a s u r p r i s e d ,
perhaps perplexed, T o m confronting
a noticeably c h a n g e d F a t F r i e n d . B u t
the play ends, for m e , puzzlingly; it
w a s a m b i g u o u s . I w a s a m b i v a l e n t
where at first I e m p h a s i s e d . T h e
e n d i n g is not unexpected, just o d d .
T h i s play attempts the terribly
daunting task of c o m b i n i n g a c o m e d y
(first act) w i t h a d r a m a ( s e c o n d a c t ) .
It w a s , in general, a s u c c e s s f u l s y n -
thesis. O n l y t h e final minute puzzles
me. S h e a n d T o m have f o u n d out
s o m e t h i n g about t h e m s e l v e s a n d
others; J a m e s h a s h a d a book a c -
cepted, finally. B u t Henry h a s us
baffled. W e haven't a clue what he
is to d o . •
That's m y only c r i t i c i s m of a n oth-
erwise fine p r o d u c t i o n . In a different
vein from m o s t W e s t E n d c o m e d y , it
benefits thereby. H i g h y r e c o m m e n d -

Dunnit, w h i c h i n time c o m e s to bear
an uncanny resemblance to " T h e

country residence one foggy m o r n i n g

critics are on stage (dead at that)
and t w o of the cast are giving the
play-within-a-play the blasting it
rightly deserves, w h i c h M o o n a n d
B i r d b o o t never d i d . T h e conventions
of the W h o - D u n n i t • are lovingly

The current p r o d u c t i o n of " T h e

with its c o m p a n i o n piece " A f t e r
M a g r i t t e " into the last fortnight of its
run at the S h a w Theatre, (halfway
between Euston a n d S t . P a n c r a s Sta-

any s h o w in L o n d o n . T i c k e t s from

The a u d i e n c e w a s a s p a c k e d a s the
stage d u r i n g the finale; the entire cast
on stage r e s e m b l e d more t h e rush
hour o n the C i r c l e Line than a chorus
line.

stood out w e r e Barney B u r n h a m a n d

The Orchestra, largely c o n s i s t i n g

the majority of the female chorus)

over loud or subtly quiet d i d they fail
to s o u n d c o n v i n c i n g .

to be eminently edible scenery, w a s
severely c r a m p e d . T h e fairies tended

Concert
Only after a great last minute rush
d i d . I manage to get to the concert o n
S a t u r d a y night. Unfortunately I
m i s s e d the beginning of Back D o o r ' s
set, but from what I heard (I certainly
c o u l d n ' t see anything for periods
longer than five s e c o n d s ) , they
s e e m e d to have developed quite a n
original brand of bluesy m u s i c , using
bass, d r u m s a n d saxes.
D u r i n g the interval, I m a n a g e d to
squeeze into a rather s m a l l region o n
the floor, but this merely shifted the
d i s c o m f o r t a n d about quarter of a n
hour after Fairport h a d taken a stage
in a l m o s t total, but temporary, dark-
ness, I w a s virtually praying that each
number w o u l d be their last.
A s for their m u s i c , I w a s s u r p r i s e d
at the number of songs they bor-
r o w e d . T h e s e c o n s i s t e d of " C o u n t r y
P i e " , D y l a n ' s George J a c k s o n , a n d
also ones from Jerry R e i d a n d B u d d y
Holly. Their o w n c o m p o s i t i o n s w e r e
quite good, a n d generally light o n the
ear, though there w e r e times w h e n
they jigged along quite nicely, especi-
ally in the encore, D a v e S w a r b r i c k ' s
fiddling injecting a little fire at these
times.
Not unnaturally, they i n c l u d e d a
few pieces from their n e w a l b u m ,
" R o s i e " , a m o n g w h i c h w a s the title
track, a delightful b a l l a d . Despite a l l
this, I can't help feeling that they
have seen better days in their long
a n d c o m p l i c a t e d history. F o r those
w h o are interested, the present line-
up is Jerry Donnahue a n d Trevor
Lucus, electric a n d a c o u s t i c guitars,
Davey Pegg, bass, Dave S w a r b r i c k .

Rialto, Coventry Street, f r o m the e n d
of t h e m o n t h .
D i r e c t e d by M a r t i n Ritt
S o u n d e r is the name of the d o g
belonging to a c o l o u r e d family w h o
live a n d w o r k o n a sugar farm in
Louisiana d u r i n g the D e p r e s s i o n
( 1 9 3 3 ) . If y o u (like me) have a n
instinctive abhorrence of a n i m a l
f i l m s , don't be put off, because the
story is more about the relationship
between the s o n a n d the father during
the difficult times they a l l have to go
through. T h e father is arrested for
stealing food a n d is sentenced to a
year's penal servitude, but d u e to
local policy, the family are not a l -
l o w e d to k n o w where he is being
kept. T h e s o n manages to find out
via a s y m p a t h e t i c local white w o m a n ,
a n d prepares t o m a k e the 5 0 - m i l e
journey o n foot to find his father.
Eventually he finds the prison c a m p ,
but is unable to find h i m , but is taken
under t h e w i n g of a black s c h o o l -
mistress w h o , recognising his intelli-
gence, offers to take h i m into the
s c h o o l for the next term.
I c a m e out of this f i l m feeling
rather o v e r w h e l m e d by w h a t I thought
was the excessive w h o l e s o m e n e s s ,
though this m a y be, a s s o m e o n e
pointed out, because there is no rape
scene or c a r chase. W h a t is g o o d
about this f i l m , however, is the splen-
d i d acting by everyone, even the d o g ,
but more important, t h e b a s i c atti-
tude of the f i l m . T h e c o l o u r e d family
is dealt w i t h sympathetically, but not
over-indulgently ( w h i c h w a s one of
my c r i t i c i s m s of " G u e s s W h o ' s C o m -
ing to D i n n e r " ) , the family w e r e
treated in exactly the s a m e w a y as if
they were s o m e poor w h i t e family
in a 1 9 5 0 ' s H o l l y w o o d budget movie.
There w a s no race-relations p r e a c h -
ing at a l l . F o r that I w a s grateful.
The direction a n d c a m e r a w o r k
were good, but not o u t s t a n d i n g : the
film tended to drag on o c c a s i o n s , a n d
the camera shots w e r e nice, but u n -
varied. ( M u s i c , incidentally, by Taj
M a h a l , a n d very g o o d ) . S o go, a n d
take your girlfriend w i t h y o u , if y o u
like to see nice people in nice sur-
roundings w i n n i n g through. B u t if,
like m e , y o u like to escape into a
c i n e m a , don't worry, the rest of the
film industry is on o u r side.

and w o r k i n g ? D o y o u w a n t a place to
go to get away from nagging teachers,
nagging parents, nagging w o r l d
problems a n d s i m p l e pain of arthritis
and neuralgia? W e l l , friends, y o u
need look no farther. C l a r k s o n C o l -
lege of T e c h n o l o g y is the place for
you. Ideally situated in lovely Pots-
d a m N e w York, y o u w i l l be overlook-
ing the s c e n i c Racquette River, k n o w n
all over the North Country for its
flowing water. A r e y o u from a b i g
city? P o t s d a m is afflicted w i t h the
highest u n e m p l o y m e n t rate in the
state, w h i c h means y o u w i l l be able
to choose from a w i d e range of
s l u m s , m a r a u d i n g gangs of a l c o h o l -
crazed youths, a n d perverts of a l l
shapes a n d sizes. A r e y o u f r o m a
s m a l l t o w n ? Y o u w i l l be able to enjoy
the latest in big-city conveniences,
such as electricity, telephones, a n d
streets n a m e d after every imaginable
species of tree. Y e s , people from a l l
types of environment w i l l feel right
at home here in P o t s d a m .
But what does P o t s d a m have to
offer in the w a y of entertainment, y o u
ask? Just one of the highest bars-per-
capita rating in upstate N e w York.
M a n y of industry's finest a l c o h o l i c s
got their start right here in P o t s d a m .
W e also boast the only $ 1 . 5 0 movie
theater left in the w o r l d a n d also a
M c D o n a l d ' s a n d a C a r r o l l ' s a n d a
M i s t e r Donut for those interminably
long, hazy nights w h e n a l l y o u seem
to d o is get hungry. F o r the male
chauvinists w e have a w h o l e c o l l e g e
filled w i t h girls just a short walk
away. F o r t h e female t h e males at
C l a r k s o n outnumber y o u 1 0 to 1. Re-
m e m b e r y o u don't have to look pretty
to make it here at T e c h , a l l y o u need
is a sense of adventure, a desire to
reach out for w h a t y o u want a n d
enough money to pay for it.
P o t s d a m is easily a c c e s s i b l e by a l l
major d o g s l e d lines a n d by s o m e
jeeps. D u r i n g the s u m m e r y o u w i l l be
able to leave P o t s d a m b y a n y form
of transportation k n o w n to m a n . T h e
s u m m e r usually runs from early J u l y
to late J u l y w h i c h makes for a lot of
fun in t h e s u n except during the rainy
s e a s o n — e a r l y January to late D e c e m -
ber. F o r those w h o w o u l d rather fly,
the town of P o t s d a m operates a large
well-equipped c o w pasture w h i c h c a n
easily be converted into a parachute
target area in times of national emer-
gency.
A l l these things are merely frosting
on the cake, however. N o t only is
C l a r k s o n located in a fabulous enter-
tainment m e c c a , but it is also the site
of a fine engineering s c h o o l . W e offer
courses leading to degrees in M e c h -
anical, Electrical, C h e m i c a l , C i v i l , a n d
C h o o - C h o o Train Engineering. N o t to
mention our pioneering Industrial
Constipation Department, a n d the
newly m i s m a n a g e d Industrial M i s -
management Department. B u t Clark-
son does not believe in cluttering a
student's m i n d w i t h just facts a n d
figures. W e believe a w e l l rounded
individual s h o u l d also have his m i n d
cluttered w i t h history, novels, letter
w r i t i n g a n d lots of c o m p o s i t i o n s
w h i c h test your ability to write lots
of c o m p o s i t i o n s . O u r H u m a n i t i e s a n d
S o c i a l Insignificance Department are
not overlooked just because C l a r k s o n
is a n engineering s c h o o l . C l a r k s o n
s p e n d s thousands of dollars a year
of your money s o that y o u w i l l k n o w

But, a l l work a n d no play makes

have the freedom to protest O U R
c h o i c e of w h i c h classes y o u are to
attend. Y o u also have the freedom t o
sit wherever y o u want in t h e class
unless your professor makes the

M a n y of y o u cringe, however, a t
the thought of a c c i d e n t a l l y learning
anything w h i l e enjoying yourself at
college. For a slight decrease in tui-
tion y o u m a y pursue a degree of
B a c h e l o r of Arts in Extra-Curricular
A c t i v i t i e s . S o m e of the more note-
worthy graduates in this field include

Of course, in order to more fully
appreciate your life at C l a r k s o n , you-
w i l l need a place to live. W e offer a
variety of living c o n d i t i o n s w h i c h
are d e s i g n e d to emulate the neigh-

you, this w i l l be your first time living
away from your parents a n d y o u
won't be prepared for s u d d e n inde-
pendence. T o m a k e your transition
easier, w e require y o u to live on c a m -
pus for at least t w o years. W e also
supply each floor with a Resident
Babysitter. Y o u will not be a l l o w e d t o

pot, make noise after 1 0 : 0 0 p . m . or
go out in the rain without your rub-
bers. After four years at C l a r k s o n y o u
w i l l have gained enough indepen-
dence to be able to go out into the

self (don't forget to look both waysiy.
