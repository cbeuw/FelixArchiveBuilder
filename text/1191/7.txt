T
oday, the inquiry into the deaths
Df 13 Catholics during a para-
troops operation in Londonderry's
Bogside District on J a n u a r y 3 0
||72, will re-open.
The announcement of a fresh tri-
Ijinal was made by Tony Blair in
January 1998. Oral evidence was
l/en at Londonderry's Guildhall in
March of this year. Lord Saville of
Mewdigate is chairing the inquiry,
(Kith costs running to £13m so far.
Although the orig-
inal tribunal of
1972 led by Lord
Chief J u s t i c e L o r d
Mdgery found the Army to be inno-
cent of any wrongdoing, the families
of the victims disagreed. Their per-
sistent campaigning to get justice
for their relatives has caused the
Prime minister to set up this new
public inquiry. It will re-examine the
evidence, which could prove that the
civilian victims were unarmed at the
time of the shootings.
At approximately 2 . 3 0 p m on
Sunday January 30 1972, the march
of civilian rights demonstrators left
Bishofields. It is estimated that the
*ge crowd comprised of between
!0,000 and 20,000 people, certainly
'he biggest gathering ever held in
Londonderry. The event was trou-
ble-free until the protestors reached
lr|
e first army barricade on William
b
treet an hour later, barring their
^trance into the Guildhall a n d
Waterloo Place. It was at this point
, h a t
the noting started, where it is
a l l e
9 e d , that m e n of t h e 2 n d
battalion were stoned for 10 min-
u
tes. C S gas and a water cannon
w e r
e used to disperse the crowd,
^eat James Street and Sackville
^tr
eet, where two other army harri-
esW e r e
erected, also saw mass
"o |
ence, with soldiers firing rubber
e
ts as well as releasing huge
3 r n
°unts of gas into the crowd.
^ Kevin McCorry, the civil rights
organiser, informed the crowd that a
meeting was starting at Free Derry
C o r n e r , w h e r e M i s s Devlin, M r
Cooper and Lord Brockway would
be giving speeches. This occurred at
4.15pm, ten minutes after a single
shot was fired in William Street.
Four or five a r m o u r e d v e h i c l e s
descended on William Street in an
attempt to break up the crowd.
T h o u s a n d s fled as paratroopers
emerged from their vehicles. Some
tried to make arrests; others ran
towards street corners. These 21
f f U n l e a s h i n g a f u r i o u s a r m
y snipers
b a r r a g e o f b u l l e t s J J
opened fire unleashing a furious bar-
rage of bullets onto the streets of
Bogside. In Fahen Street, one man
was even seen holding up a white
hankerchief but this did not deter
the soldiers from directing shots at
him. S o u n d s of m a c h i n e guns,
thought to be the work of the IRA,
punctuated the continuous hard
banging of the self-loading rifle
(SLRs), attributed to the British. In
five s e p a r a t e l o c a t i o n s around
Bogside thirty people were killed or
injured, predominantly young men
but including a w o m a n knocked
down by a speeding Army vehicle.
Lawyers for the fourteen victims
have accumulated 60,000 pages of
evidence to date. Mystery still sur-
rounds the rifles which Lord Saville
asked the Ministry of Defence for,
back in 1998. He had requested al!
the S L R s used by the paratrooper
so that they could be subject to rig-
orous forensic examination. This
could reveal whether adapted rifles
ordered by Major General Robert
Ford were used on Bloody Sunday.
Major General Robert Ford was
then in charge of the running of the
Army in Northern Ireland. Saville
has recently declassified a secret
m e m o from F o r d to Lieutenant
General Harry Tuzo, his Superior in
Ulster. He calls the rioters 'Derry
Young Hooligans (DYH)' and contin-
ues that traditional crowd control
methods such as C S gas and rubber
bullets were not proving effective in
dealing with them. Stormont and
W e s t m i n s t e r were keen for the
A r m y to restore p e a c e in the
province, particularly in the catholic
areas. More relevant to the inquiry
is the statement Ford made at the
end of the memo, only three weeks
prior to the fateful riots of Bloody
Sunday. "The minimum force neces-
sary to achieve a restoration of law
and order is to shoot selected ring-
leaders among the DYH after clear
warnings have been given." He pro-
claimed.
The self-loading rifles in question
were the main infantry weapons
deployed by the British Army in the
1970s. However they were phased
out steadily until they were eventu-
ally replaced by the SA80 in 1986.
Of the 20 rifles produced in the
W i d g e r y inquiry, 14 have been
destroyed as well as 10 sold to pri-
vate c o m p a n i e s . A l t h o u g h the
inquiry was told the 5 rifles left
7.62mm round in the SLRs. Notably
though, one of those killed, 17 year
old Kevin McElhimey, had an entry
wound which measured only 3mm.
The pathologists' findings could be
at fault or the bullet may have been
fired from a different type of rifle
altogether, possibly a 0.22 in (which
the S A 8 0 fires) . Size of the entry
w o u n d alone does not give the
whole picture as the same bullet can
produce various dimensions accord-
ing to whether the it was a ricochet,
the type of body tissue infiltrated
and the path it follows in the air. It
seems with just three rifles to exam-
ine, it will be extremely difficult to
establish the distance from which
the guns were fired. Thus making it
hard to confirm whether what wit-
nesses have stated about the para-
troopers firing from close range is
true or not.
The irony about the whole inquiry
is that the truth about the events of
Bioody Sunday was known '25 years
ago'. The Crown would have had 'no
prospect of a successful defence' in
four specific cases; it was claimed
w o u l d " m o s t p r o b a b l y " l y i n g ° y t h e t h e n

w h e n s h o t t w i c e a t
c l o s e r a n g e
s e c u r e
ly, a further two
were destroyed
II Rawlinson. Of
these men, Wray,
22, was 'most proba-
m January of last year, against an
internal Ministry of Defence order.
One of the victim's relatives, John
Kelly, whose younger brother was
killed, was outraged saying; " W e
believe the destruction of the guns
just before M r Blair's announcement
of the new tribunal proves there
was a deliberate attempt to pervert
the course of justice."
Forensic evidence from the origi-
nal inquiry c o n c l u d e d that the
ammunition the Army claimed to be
using on that Sunday matched the
post mortems. The entry wounds on
twelve of the people shot dead
measured between 6-8mm; which
would have resulted from the
bly' lying on the ground when he
w a s shot twice at close range.
Widgery had exonerated the Army
on the soldiers' own version of
events along with the forensic evi-
dence given by Dr John Martin. The
Doctor's report suggested that the
d e a d w e r e armed with guns or
bombs. But he has admitted now
those tests for lead particles leading
him to this conclusion were incon-
clusive. The outcome of the tribunal
of April 1972 is now seemingly
b a s e d solely on the soldiers'
a c c o u n t s of events. The British
Army fears the exact details of that
march coming to light after twenty-
eight years of secrecy.
