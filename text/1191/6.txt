Fears over m a d c o w d i s e a s e
have r e s u r f a c e d in E u r o p e
this week, this time with France's
c a t t l e c o m i n g u n d e r t h e s p o t -
light. C o n c e r n about the safety
of F r e n c h b e e f p r o d u c t s h a s
been growing, following a recent
s u r g e in t h e n u m b e r of B S E
infected cattle and C J D related
deaths, amongst the human pop-
ulation.
S o far, v e t s have r e g i s t e r e d
100 c a s e s of B S E in F r e n c h
herds this year, many of which
were recorded in the N o r m a n d y
region, where the French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin was trying
to calm public fears. In a state-
ment to the French parliament,
he later announced stricter con-
trols for livestock feed and called
for a temporary ban on the sale
of T-bone steaks. His proposals
have since been echoed by sen-
ior E U officials w h o insist that
these measures should be intro-
duced, not just to France, but to
all of t h e 15 E u r o p e a n U n i o n
member states as well. Europe's
food s a f e t y c o m m i s s i o n e r : M r
David Byrne told journalists at a
B r u s s e l s n e w s c o n f e r e n c e :
there h a s been c o n c e r n in m y
mind as to the controls relating
to meat and bone m e a l ( M B M ) in
animal feed. I have put forward
proposals that are essential for
the e n h a n c e m e n t of c o n s u m e r
c o n f i d e n c e . " S a l e s of b e e f in
France, alone have s l u m p e d by
as much as 50% and some coun-
t r i e s s u c h a s Italy a n d
Switzerland have gone for an all
out ban of certain French meat
products, until they have suffi-
cient evidence that they are safe
for human consumption.
However France is not alone in
f a c i n g s p e c u l a t i o n o v e r t h e
health of
it's cattle. S p a i n h a s already
reported it's first two c a s e s of
the d i s e a s e a n d G e r m a n y is
d e s c r i b e d a s h a v i n g b e e n
plunged into a state of shock by
last w e e k ' s discovery that B S E
has n o w landed on i t ' s s h o r e s .
J u s t a w e e k a g o t h e G e r m a n
government was insisting that no
B S E actually existed in the coun-
try. This s t a t e m e n t h a s s i n c e
been retracted and now German
farmers a r e helplessly watching
t h e i r b e e f m a r k e t e v a p o r a t e
before
their e y e s . P o l i t i c i a n s in t h e
country appear to be doing little
to appease the quarter of a mil-
lion Germans that rely upon cat-
tle farming for their livelihood. In
a n a t i o n a l a n n o u n c e m e n t ,
G e r m a n Health Minister Andrea
fisher advised people to stick to
organic beef only-thus encourag-
ing them to reject the remaining
9 5 % of t h e m e a t r e a r e d on
German farms. O m a n and other
M i d d l e E a s t e r n countries w e r e
quick to follow suit, they have
a n n o u n c e d a b a n on a l l b e e f
imports (with the e x c e p t i o n of
milk) from France,
I r e l a n d , P o r t u g a l a n d
Switzerland. Similar precautions
a r e a l s o b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d by
other Gulf States and Greece. In
a desperate attempt to calm the
e s c a l a t i n g s i t u a t i o n , m i n i s t e r s
from the 15 E U nations met for a
gruelling 16 hours of talks to dis-
cuss growing fears over what the
c o m m i s s i o n c a l l e d "disturbing"
levels of B S E , in France in par-
t i c u l a r . T h e y h a v e s i n c e pro-
p o s e d n e w t e s t s , d e s i g n e d to
target older a n i m a l s that have
not been covered by the existing
safety checks. These are expect-
ed to c o m e into force from as
early as today and each test is
estimated to cost around £20 per
c o w . T h i s m a y s e e m r a t h e r
expensive; given the large num-
ber of cattle that will have to be
s c r e e n e d - h o w e v e r the c o m m i s -
sion insists the price is worth it,
in order to give c o n s u m e r s an
extra s a f e t y g u a r a n t e e f o r the
beef that they buy. A spokesman
for the E U commissioner, David
Byrne, said: "He
c o n s i d e r s it essential that in
the c u r r e n t c i r c u m s t a n c e s w e
r e v i e w t h e i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of
B S E controls".
A n a l y s t s s a y that there is a
strong chance both of these pro-
posals will be a c c e p t e d by the
m e m b e r s t a t e s , a n d c o u n t r i e s
outside the E U , such as Poland,
will ha.ve to s e t up t h e i r o w n
monitoring bodies if they wish to

meat products to Europe.
