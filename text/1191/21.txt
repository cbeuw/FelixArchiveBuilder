U r b a n L e g e n d s : F i n a l C u t B l a c k a n d W h i t e
Director: John Ottman
Starring: Jennifer Morrison,
Matthew Davis and Eva Mendes
T
he sequel to the year before
last's story about a campus-
based serial killer is (somewhat
unsurprisingly) a n o t h e r s t o r y
about a campus-based serial killer.
This time the c a m p u s is A l p i n e
University, the elitist film school. It
is the end of term and senior year
students are rushing to finish their
thesis films before they graduate.
Competition for the best film is
made even tougher by the presti-
gious Hitchcock a w a r d ; a prize
which not only gives the recipient
a
large sum of money, but also the
chance to m a k e f i l m s in
Hollywood. A opportunity that film
students would literally kill for.
This actually adds quite a nice
twist- a sort of 'is it part of the
f l l r
" or part of the film in the film' -
w
hich distinguishes it from the
f i r
st 'Urban Legend'.
n
fact the whole story is quite
S e
Parate from the first. The only
character to cross over is Reese
( L
° r e t t a D e v i n e ) , the C a m p u s
security guard, a little bit tougher
u t
still the same; and the rumour
o f a
n Urban Legend killer at 'some
U n i v
e r s i t y up the c o a s t ' . T h i s
rumour inspires our heroine, Amy
(Jennifer Morrison), to make her
thesis film a psychological thriller
about a serial killer who kills his
victims in the style of urban leg-
ends. Most of the urban legends
have quite a long run up to them -
you know something is going to
happen but you're not quite sure
what. This means that half the fun
of the film is trying to guess which
urban legend is about to happen.
In many ways this film is similar to
all others of its genre. The main
character is a girl with 'issues' in
her p a s t . S h e works out long
before anyone else that everyone
is being murdered and that all the
murders are related to her. O f
course, no one believes her. There
is s o m e dubious male interest
Trevor (Matthew Davies) that you
are not quite sure if she should
trust and despite the fact that she
knows someone is trying to kill her
she runs towards the sound of
screaming, on her own, completely
unarmed, in the dark. But lets face
it, if you like teen thriller slashers
then this will be right up your alley
(preferably a deserted one with
minimal lighting and a masked
serial killer hiding in the shadows).

A
t first t h o u g h t , Black and
White s e e m s like a terrible
Idea for a movie. A picture star-
ring, a m o n g s t o t h e r s , C l a u d i a
Schiffer, N B A star Allan Houston,
selected members of the Wu-Tang
clan, and Mike Tyson all in a movie
about Black and White cultures
colliding in modern day New York.
The movie is a mess - there seems
to be very little structure to it at
all. There is a weak central plot
concerning a corrupt cop (Stiller)
who bribes a basketball star to
throw a game with unexpectedly
tragic consequences. There does-
n't appear to have been any script
for this movie - it bounces from
scene to scene without any obvi-
ous direction, and most of it is
clearly hugely improvised. There is
a woman making a documentary
(Shields) about white teens hang-
ing out in the ghetto pretending to
be " n i g g a z " . Her h u s b a n d ' s
( D o w n e y J n r . ) h o m o s e x u a l i t y
seems to be obvious to everyone
except her . There's a black gang
who just s e e m to s p e n d t h e i r
entire time shagging up in a pent-
house apartment belonging to a
rap group (members of the W u -
Tang clan).
What stops this from being a total
disaster is the cast - unusual, cer-
tainly, but some fine performanc-
es. Ben Stiller and Joe Pantoliano
turn in s o m e g o o d work, and
D o w n e y J n r . is v e r y a m u s i n g .
What is more surprising is that the
supporting cast isn't too bad -
S c h i f f e r and H o u s t o n won't be
winning any Oscars, but their pres-
ence doesn't kill the movie like
other celebrity performances could
have done (i.e. Cindy C r a w f o r d ,
Aaliyah etc). A n d Tyson is just
himself. The Idea of anyone asking
Tyson for advice on conflict resolu-
tion is funny enough, but the scene
where Downey Jnr. comes on to
him is hilarious.
Black and White is an acquired
taste; It's interesting if nothing
else. If you can swallow a movie
that's less than the sum of it's col-
lective parts you may find it a stim-
ulating hour and forty minutes. If
you're looking for some story in
there to stimulate the grey matter,
you'll be disappointed.
(Black and White is in cinemas
now).
