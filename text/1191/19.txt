The man himself - The Judge
Capital's Clubbing at it's finest
The Gallery, Friday night @ Turnmills
The Gallery - Friday night theme
at Turnmills. Famous galleries
usually hold several masterpieces.
In a clubbing world, The Gallery at
Turnmills held three; Judge Jules,
Timo M a a s a n d a m e m o r a b l e
atmosphere. Described by experi-
enced clubbers as the best night
out in London, true fans of hard-
house^and trance w o u l d surely
have to a g r e e . S i t u a t e d in t h e
heart of the Clerkenwell area near
Farringdon Tube Station, Turnmills
is the home of euphoric music in
London.
°n arrival at 11:30pm I laughed at
'ne ridiculously immense queues,
mainly due to the very fair £ 1 0
entry. Avoid disappointment and
'eave the union bar early. M o s t
'm
Portantly, The beefy bouncers
have their heads where the sun
doesn't shine, so hassling them
about t h e queue is n o t r e c o m -
m e
n d e d . The wait is worthwhile,
s o b e patient. O n c e inside g e t
y o u r b e a r i n g s . T h e main room
h o s t s t h e b i g D J s , but a back
room playing funky house and a
c a f e c a n help y o u momentarily
chill out.
The night was to be special. Rarely
do you see the likes of Timo Maas,
followed swiftly on the decks by
Judge Jules. Regularly mentioned
by the Judge on his radio show,
the Gallery offers weekly a list full
of D J s w h o play there because
they want to, knowing the crowd
will respond to their sets,
A s I stood in the middle of the
tightly packed floor dazed by the
laser lights a n d s u r r o u n d e d by
s w e a t y , e c c e n t r i c , s c r e a m i n g
trance lovers, I soon realised that
the Gallery does hold the key to
'ultimate clubbing'.
With its fluorescent and luminous
interior, abstract wall projections
and elaborate ceiling decorations,
Turnmills is definitely for those
who a p p r e c i a t e quality. Don't
expect a floor packed with gor-
geous people though. N o , there
are not to many of us students
packing the dance floor. Instead
prepare yourself for a mainly male
and 20-something crowd, dripping
with sweat and rattling with pills.
Drinks are expensive, but don't let
dehydration strike. Pace yourself
t h r o u g h o u t t h e 1 0 : 3 0 p m to
7:30am session, a vodka and red
bull will s e t y o u back a s t e e p
£7.50, while a bottle of Coke is a
cool £2.50. Also dress to impress,
although the hardcore Judge fans
did m a n a g e to c o n t r a d i c t this
house rule, being dressed like air-
port traffic police.
As an added extra we ended the
night by beating the crowds to the
D J booth where we managed to
gain access, and meet two nice
g e e z e r s called J u l e s a n d Timo.
Not bad for a night out in one of
London's finest galleries.

Marble Valley
Sunset Sprinkler
(Pork Recordings)
Marble Valley w e r e f o r m e d in
1997 by Steve West, the drummer
from Pavement, and this, their
second album, is a quirky mix of
percussion and synthesiser driven
tracks that, d e s p i t e s o u n d i n g
strange at first, grow on you very
quickly. Most of the songs are
good, some are bad and several
are just weird but all of them are
unique. If you are looking for a
substitute for this year's rather
bland offerings, or if you are just a
pavement fan you will probably
enjoy this o r i g i n a l , if s l i g h t l y
strange, offering. Sunset Sprinkler
is released on 4th December.
The Action Time
Versus The World
(Southern)
Kenickie are dead, long live The
Action Time. O n e band, 3 girls
and 3 boys. One aim, to pervert
modern music by steam rolling
head first as a punk rock jugger-
naut. As subtle as a brick, their
whirlwind harmonies leave you
dazed and confused as they rush
through a full album in less than
30 minutes.
To The Action Time, talking the
game and looking right is as
much as the sound. Thick eyelin-
er, immaculately coiffured black
hair and Sex Pistol cockiness, it
all adds to their swagger. A band
aiming high, pushing hard with
everything they have. Don't
expect them to stick around, but
the fast thrills are fun while they
last.
