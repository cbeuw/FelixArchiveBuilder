w ork on Friday 1st which it is hoped m a y
improve the abilities of rowers and reduce the
likelihood of them s u s t a i n i n g an injury.
Researchers from the Biodynamics group stud-
ied elite members of the Boat Club using an
MRI scanner at St Mary's, which allows sub-
jects to carry out tasks normally within it. The
images allow the strain on the spine to be moni-
tored, and showed that differing stresses were
placed on the spine and lower back when row-
ers were either fatigued or deliberately simulat-
ing poor technique. The researchers are hoping
to compare how techniques differ across boat
clubs, and are studying a new rowing technique.
