A N ACRID ATTITUDE...
Dear John,
Two things to sort out.
(1) I am not currently, nor have I
ever been, involved in mascotry
activities. I am certainly not a "Guilds
spokesman". (Not the impression I
got, but thanks for clearing it up -
Ed) If you would like an official
Guilds statement (or simply want a
list of all the inaccuracies in your last
article) please get in touch with the
Vice-President, Sarah Bluhme, who
is responsible for all mascotry affi-
ars.
(2) You did not print my letter about
our DPF&S. I am assuming that this
is because you did not want to print
two letters from the same person
(what would you do if both myself
and the other Mustafa Arif were to
write in at the same time?) and not
because you only like printing nasty
stuff about Etienne. So, to spare you
from having to choose between let-
ters, I've tagged it on to the end of
this one:
Following a state of letters from var-
ious people publicly expressing their
g r i e v a n c e s with our D e p u t y
President (Finance & Services), I
thought I'd write in to say that I think
he's doing a sterling job. From my
own experiences so far he seems to
be competent and conscientous. I
have also found him to be courteous
at all times (although he is known to
have a short temper).
They way I see it. Any DP(F&S) is
bound to upset a few people. That is
the nature of the job. He can't just
let everyone spend whatever they
want, or he wouldn't be doing a
decent job as a treasurer. Keep up
the good work Etienne.
Mustafa Arif
No, I don't mind printing good stuff
about Etienne. 2 letters in a week is
a little greedy though, so I was
going to print it this week, along
with all the other letters I didn't have
room for last week. Some people
have no patience... Can both
Mustafas please state their depart-
ments though, otherwise I'm bound
to get confused and I don't want
that. Secondly, lets not talk about
inaccuracies, shall we? Especially
not when it comes to docking
Editor's salaries -Ed
A QUESTION OF N O FAITH
Dear Editor,
A s the acting president of the
Secular Society and the author of
the the S o c i e t i e s posters I feel
moved to reply to Mr Yorke-Smith's
letter in your last issue (1190, 27th
December). I feel that I can clarify
some points of Secular belief to Mr
Yorke-Smith, and answer some of
his questions, something I could not
do for the author of the previous let-
ter (Wes), whose critisism took the
form of a rant rather than that of a
rational argument.
In his letter Mr Yorke-Smith asks
whether I am promoting scientism
rather than science. The Secular
Society does indeed believe that the
Scientific method, that of rational
inquiry, is the only philosophically
defensible method of finding out
facts about the Universe. Now two
questions will spring to the mind of
the religious reader. The first would
probably be : Is this a masked a pri-
ori rejection of religion and the idea
of a God ?
The a n s w e r is no, the S e c u l a r
Society offers no objections a priori
against the possibility of a deity.
However we maintain that should a
deity exist the only way of objective-
ly verifying its existence would be
through rational inquiry, be it scien-
tific or philosophical. What we main-
tain is that there is no rational evi-
dence for a God, and therefore no
reason to believe in one. What we
categorically are not saying is that
science and rationality somehow
preclude the possibility of a deity.
Therefore we do indeed think clearly
about the evidence of a Palestinian
teacher 2000 years ago. W e analyse
all evidence in a rational way and
come to conclusions. It is simply a
matter of fact that we come to the
atheist conclusion, rather than a sci-
entific conspiracy against religious
evidences. In conclusion, this 'atheist
a priori dismissal' meme finds safety
in popularity, rather than in sub-
stance.
The second query that might come
to mind would be : Does this mean
that the only thing that matters is
s c i e n c e , and that s c i e n c e can
answer everything ? Clearly once
again the S e c u l a r a n s w e r is a
resounding no. It would be impossi-
ble for even a hardened Scientist to
derive any defensible moral system
by science alone I Of course emo-
tions matter I Where would any of
us be without love, guilt, anger, hap-
piness... ? Indeed it is obvious to
theists and atheists alike that sci-
ence isn't all that matters. And as a
matter of fact there are questions
that science (at this moment) cannot
answer, the big 'why' questions that
M r Yorke-Smith was alluding to.
However this does not mean that
there must be something else that
can answer them. Nor that these
questions even have a satisfactory
answer I
The question 'why are we here ?' in
my opinion is a bit of a null question
in the absense of a creator God. If in
fact there is no God, then the ques-
tion has no emotionally satisfying
answer. W e can scientifically find
out about evolution, and the origin of
species, and the regress of the uni-
verse, but in the absence of fore-
thought there is no real why . W e
just are, its as simple as that. The
fact that this is not as emotionally
satisfying an answer as is given in
Genesis is by the by. However it
does not lead to the conclusion that
life or the universe is inherantly
worthless because it lacks purpose.
In fact, the Secular Society values
life as much as any other, and wish-
es only to improve its condition on
planet earth.
I would like to thank Mr Yorke-Smith
for his letter, since it has allowed me
to clarify exactly the position of the
Secular Society on some very irnpor,
tant matters that are often misun.
d e r s t o o d and misrepresented
would also like to invite him, alonq
with anyone else who would like to
ask us questions, to our first meet,
ing which will be held from 4-6»

thankyou very much for your time
and column space,
Yours Sincerely,

Dear Felix,
It has come to my attention
that certain people at Imperial
C o l l a g e are slightly lacking ina
sense of humour. While I definitely
don't want to be drawn into a
Science vs. Religion argument (
m
y
own life experiences having giver
me an incredibly polarised viewol
the whole debate), I do think that
there is a bit too much sensitivity
regarding Mr Secura's posters.
I personally feel that the secular
societies posters are light-hearted
My belief, Wes, is that the "Born O
K
the first time" was a reference to the'
Christian philosophy that one has tc
be "born again" within the faith to b
e
"saved" - a little play on words, that's
all.
When any group (i.e. not necessarily
religious) protests so loudly about
something which is still only some-
one else's opinion, it tends to gi*
the impression that they are worried
that the masses won't choose their
own group if this individual says sud1
and such. Which would indicate that
they are worried that their own
words aren't as persuasive or strong
in foundation. Please note I am n
o
t
saying this is necessarily the easel
but that it is the impression that
comes across. A bit like when some-
one says "ooohh, what did you t«c
get up to last night!", and you 9eI
[
really defensive and angry becaus6
,
you know they're right.
The deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 no011
- drop into the office or email fe!ix@jc.ac.uk. Letters may be edited f°f
length but not grammar or spelling.
