Angela
(Wordplay/Source)
Fantastic single from this French Hip-
Hop collective. The soulful lyrics com-
bine superbly with S S C ' s trademark
skillful vocal dexterity. There's even
s o m e L a t i n v i b e s g o i n g on h e r e .
Angela was in the French Top 5 for
four weeks over the Summer, and it's
great. Get this now!
Last Man Standing |
Shotgun Mouth
(Stand Alone Recordings))
Ahhh, what's that in my ears?!?!? Is it
a bee, or a wasp?!?!? No! It's this
song! Super-fuzzy bass and distor-
tion, they sound like angry teenagers,
and aren't t e e n a g e r s so a d o r a b l e
when they're angry...This isn't bad,
probably worth seeing live. What is a
Shotgun Mouth?
Bon Jovi 1
Thank You For Loving!
Me I
(Jambco)
I had heard that Bon J o v i ' s latest
album Crush was a welcome, rousing
r e v i s i t to t h e i r p o p - r o c k r o o t s .
However, this single from their album
is a barely warmed-over rehash of
the track Always from the album
Crossroads. This is a rather simple,
sappy ballad. Strictly for fans only.
Big Sur
EP
(Arista)
This is a bit more like it - one of the
hundreds of 'next big things' flying
about at the m o m e n t , it c o m e s
a c r o s s like Belle and S e b a s t i a n ,
except it's not wank. Wistful guitar
pop of the type that Buffalo Tom do
so well, with the third track, Waiting
For You being especially good.

jTrecco Bay EP
i(Clearsound)
This lot seem to have missed their
time by about 5 years - mid-90's
indie p o p , in a N o r t h e r n
U p r o a r / M e n s w e a r style. Not any-
thing you haven't heard before, and
it all sounds a bit dated now.
Apollo 440
Charlie's Angels
(Sony)
Typical Apollo 440 fare - the drum-
mer having a fit in the background,
a few guitars thrown in for good
measure, and completely devoid of
any semblance of being good. Not
as bad as Lost In Space, but then
that's not much of an achievement.
Lo-fidelity Allstars, supported by Space Raiders
@ Heaven
Having lost two band members, including their vocalist, around
time of their last U K tour two years ago, you might think that t
h
e
Lo-Fi Allstars have difficulty returning to the stage with the same
presence that they used to have. However their explosive perform-
ance on the final date of their recent U K tour blew away any doubts
you might have had about the band. The raucous, adrenalin-filled se:
was a statement of intent as the band made clear that they were a
s
loud and as energetic as they have ever been, and that "this is NOT;
comeback".
Space Raiders supported, and camped it up in Village People out-
fits. The two frontmen made an enthusiastic duo, who were perhapsi
little too lively for the crowd, but all in all not a bad performance.
Lo-Fi Allstars came on and showcased their "new sound" - whict
seemed to have elements of Primal Scream, Death In Vegas a
n
c
Bentley Rhythm Ace - with a good selection of their new tracks such
as The All and Voodoo House. They also played old tracks such a
s
Battle Flag and Disco Machine Gun. This good mix of old and n
e
w
]
meant that the fans were kept happy whilst also being introduced tt
the new material, all of which was played with the same full-on atti-
tude.
However, I found that the new material lacked some of the dark.i
psychotic feel that made their last album so damn good. None of their
seemed to have a distinctive sound. In a sense it felt as if they hac|
lost some of their identity.
But hey, that was the past, what about now? Now, they havej
more than enough talent and musical firepower to beat the seve'j
shades of shoeshine out of most of the whmey-arsed bands around a'|
the moment. Their eclectic mix of styles and moods means that the'l
music is always fresh and exciting, and ultimately powerful. I challen9e
you to go to one of their gigs and not find something that you like.
