T h e Italian Job C o m p e t i t i o n s !
Director: Peter Coliinson
Starring: Michael Caine, Noel
Coward and Benny Hill.
Hold o n , this isn't a new
r e l e a s e , " I hear you mutter
under your breath. And indeed my
little observant cherubs you are
not mistaken, for The Italian Job
was a c t u a l l y r e l e a s e d in 1969.
However, it is the first film in the
"After Dark" series appropriately
named because they are shown
quite late at the BFI IMAX cinema
in Waterloo.
You've probably heard enough of
my rantings about how impressive
the IMAX cinema in Waterloo is. It
is e n c a s e d in an odd cylindrical
shaped building, interestingly posi-
tioned in the middle of a round-
about, w h i c h jumps out at you
after you keep following the South
Bank signs out of the underground.
However, once you've negotiated
the subways and hand over your
good money, you are submerged in
an media experience that only the
best cinema in Britain can give
you.
Usually such films as The Italian
Job are not usually shown because
they are not IMAX, and hence do
not show off the c i n e m a ' s true
potential. However, due to public
d e m a n d , such c l a s s i c films are
being shown, a year after the first
were tried. Just because of the
sheer size of the screen and steep
inclination at which you are posi-
tioned, watching a film in such an
environment is a totally different
e x p e r i e n c e . The Italian Job is
supremely enjoyable, those little
minis scooting all over the giant
screen, in what must be one of the
films that d e f i n e d the c o o l
Britannia image of the 1960's.
A l s o , with the o p e n i n g of the
W e l l c o m e W i n g at the S c i e n c e
Museum, IC students can see fea-
tures previously reviewed in Felix
for the m e a s i l y sum of £ 5 . 9 5
(remember actual entry is free) at
the I M A X now r e s i d i n g t h e r e .
However, the "After Dark" series
is only shown at the BFI IMAX, and
be warned, it sells out very quickly
indeed. The "After Dark" series is
shown only on the last weekend of
the month. All of the next films are
all heartily recommended.

LA Confidential - 26th, 27th Jan.
