joy disposal. I must stress this point, using
other people to warm a patient can be very
effective, but you must be careful and use com-
mon sense in making this decision. Do not ever
put yourself in a position where you end up cre-
ating a second patient!
Jane warmed up within less than an hour,
slurped up some warm broth, and ended up fin-
ishing the trip without a problem. But what if
she had been suffering from severe hypother-
mia? What would she have looked like and how
would it have been treated? Well, if severely
hypothermic, J a n e would never have left her
tent, even with Mark's assistance. S h e would
not have been able to speak at all and would not
be aware of the environment around her. S h e
would have been as cold as a river rock and def-
initely boasting an unhealthy skin colour (a love-
ly bluish/purple). Her heart and breathing rate
will have slowed a lot, and if a pulse is taken she
may even appear dead.
Scary huh? A s I s t a t e d e a r l i e r , s e v e r e
hypothermia is a

emergency
and it does not get emergency
solved in the back country. You should not move
a severe hypothermic nor should you try to
rewarm them (constructing a shelter around
them is certainly advisable if possible). There
are a lot of reasons for this, the most important

would likely contact a
helicopter rescue group
like Life Flight before travelling out to the
severe hypothermic themselves. Speed is not
the critical factor in the rescue effort so much
as s t e a d y a n d g e n t l e m a n a g e m e n t of the
hypothermic patient. W e like to think of severe
hypothermics as panes of glass that easily shat-
ter.
So that's hypothermia in a nutshell. If you find
this stuff interesting and want to learn more or
just have a few questions please feel free to fire
questions to Felix. Also remember all those ded-
icated, patient, and caring folks over in the cam-
pus health centre, they are a resource that
should not be forgotten. Requests for future
wiiderness medical articles are welcomed.
