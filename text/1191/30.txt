ICII112-51 Reading II
It has been said that Rugby is
a game of two halves. A n d so it
proved to be. The men in togas
started scoring early and IC heads
began to drop.
However we fought back, lib-
erally spearheaded by Bob Coults
with some excellent play with the
boot (and no, he wasn't kicking).
Rick Roberts, playing like a man
possessed, "limited" the half time
score to 46 - 0.
S o m e subtle half time alter-
ations to the line up turned the
second half into more of a contest.
IC had the lion share of possession
and territory through some for-
w a r d d r i v i n g from W i l l G r e e n
despite being distracted for most
of the game by the oppositions
testicles!
The festival rugby continued
and led to Rich Seppings bombing
over in the c o r n e r to o p e n our
a c c o u n t . T h e t o g a m e n rallied
resulting with their number nine
sneaking over with a little help
from the "Windmill" at no.8.
IC were not finished stamped-
ing straight back into opposition
territory. A quick penalty on the
five yard line from D a v e " B o y o "
White saw Titsy eat his opposite
"winger" and cruise over to seal the
second half win to IC.

Ladies Football and Netball
IC 1sts 24 - 37 Roehampton
It is a rare occasion that netball girls are
not up for it. A n d it is just as rare for netball
girls to lack bounce. B u t this w a s one of
those times. B y bounce, I of course mean
energy, oomf, jumping a bit, a bit of air
between the ground and her trainers.
Anyway, the first quarter wasn't our best
and Roehampton got themselves a good lead.
The 2nd quarter our fighting spirit popped
over to s a y hello and they gained only 4
goals. And the 3rd quarter they only got 2.
The last quarter the girls got psyched up to
fight even more, mental J e s s and her grunts
returned, Hannah's hangover w a s wearing
off.
The last quarter, we got 3 up on them. It
was sweeeet play. All sounds grand, but we
still lost. O u r attack w a s looking gooood.
S h i r l e y is h a v i n g a g r e a t s e a s o n , a n d
Rebecca and her are totally connecting in the
circle, in a totally non-sexual way of course,
before we over excite the IC men.
Hannah didn't do as much 'shaking of her
arse' this week - something about going to
Scandies the night before and having one too
many diet coke methinks. Hehe, still we've all
been there, playing with a hangover... any-
way, moving on swiftly. Our defence has seen
happier days. A n d Roehampton's shooters
were simply the best, better than all the rest,
better than, no that's as far I know. N o one
was too keen to break an ankle on the super-
slippery court, but heck, what's an ankle for
the sake of netball.... Maybe we should learn
to w e a r o u r hair in high p o n y t a i l s , h a v e
matching stripy socks, shout 'ball' really really
loudly (and get blown up for intimidation
hehehe) (sounds a rather malicious tactic
blowing the opposition up, it actually means
blow the whistle for a penalty pass before
any confusion arises and the tabloids come a-
knocking) and we'd be sorted.
That or a pint of redbull before every
game.
Ladies cash in on more Bucks! 13-0
( A dedication to Lou Reed)
Just a perfect day,
Win footie match in the park,
Then later, when it got dark,
W e went home...
Just a perfect day,
Minibus on the motorway,
Skanky changing rooms - what the hey!
W e still won!
Chorus:
Oh, its such a perfect day,
Five goals scored in the first half,
(doo doo doo doo)
Just such a perfect game,
W e just kept on scoring more (*2)
Just such a perfect day,
The referee was insane,
But we scored more and used our brains
13-011!
Chorus:
Oh, its such a perfect day,
Magic muffins were eaten,
(doo doo doo doo)
Just such a perfect game,
Bucks college were so beaten (*2)
