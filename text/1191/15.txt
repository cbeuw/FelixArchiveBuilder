jo see the irony in taking a stab at
fj[r. Segura for voicing his opinions
0 n life's questions, but then doing
the same thing themselves. S o I
would like to reiterate that I am not
questioning whether an individuals
beliefs are correct. S o m e of my
friends, for example, seem to think
that Star Trek is brilliant, when it is
quite clearly not.

Dear Felix,
read with interest the recent pieces
in your magazine covering cycle
theft
and bike parking.
I just took a quick stroll in order to
assess the number of cyclists on the
South K e n . c a m p u s . I c o u n t e d
around 400 cycles locked outside;
the majority of these could be found
within 10 or so 'designated locations'
spread around the site. These cycle
parks were all in heavy use (80% full,
say) except for the very large site
outside electrical engineering which
was about 60% empty. Since this
empty cycle park is very close to
Dalby Ct. it suggests that a large
new bike shed here would not be
ideally placed.
Besides, I would think that the total
JUST PLAIN INSANE
area taken up by the (very cramped)
cycle parks approaches 750 square
meters; this would take up a signifi-
cant chunk of Dalby Ct. Presumably
this would make a central cycle stor-
age facility impractical as well as
undesirable.
So if anything is done to improve the
cycle parking facilities, I would argue
that it should be mirrored at a num-
ber of locations around the campus.
Surely the least we can hope for is
some well-spaced Sheffield racks
with a C C T V camera trained on
them.
What about something better? I
suspect that because the existing
cycle parking is located in awkward
nooks and crannies that it would be
difficult to implement lockers or
build secure compounds at the exist-
ing locations. I would think that if
college are serious about improving
cycle parking facilities, they might
need to allocate some better space
to cycle parking. Perhaps college
should carry out a proper feasibility
study examining the requirements
for cycle parking and the options
available. This might include a sur-
vey of how people get to college. I
suspect this would reveal that more
people cycle than drive which would
help to justify their expenditure and
loss of any car parking spaces.
Besides improving parking facilities
maybe college could be persuaded
to
appoint a cycling officer. This would
provide a focus for cyclists and
reduce the apathy which Hamish
referred to. I would guess that the
cycling population of the South
Kensington campus will approach
10% in the summer months (if there
are 400 cycles parked on campus on
a November lunchtime, then includ-
ing bikes hidden away in peoples
offices, cyclists not on campus and
the increased use of cycles in sum-
mer, this number should rise consid-
erably).
Surely 700 or so cyclists deserve
some form of recognition. For
example it would be nice for some-
one to organise discounted bike
maintenance schemes or to repre-
sent the interests of cyclists to the
Royal P a r k s or to the London
B o r o u g h of K e n s i n g t o n and
Chelsea.
Finally, I agree with Hamish that
there is nothing particularly difficult
in achieving improved cycle parking
if the political will is there and would
urge Hamish to ensure that some-
thing does happen.
Yours,
Tim Grainger

Dear all,
I wish to inform the students from all
subjects about the exciting Guest
Lectures organised in the coming
weeks by the Biochemistry Society.
The first lecture takes place on
Thursday 7th December and is pre-
sented by the world famous scientist
Professor Lord Robert Winston.
The lecture entitled 'Ethics in
Science' asks whether scientists
should be held accountable for the
science they create. Science is no
longer simply about harmless curios-
ity. A s science impacts the whole of
society who should decide the moral
standpoint in controversial issues
such as prenatal genetic screening?
This lecture is to be held on
Thursday 7th December at 6.30pm
in the B M S L e c t u r e Theatre 2.
Admission is free with refreshments
afterwards. Arrive early to ensure
entry. The second high profile lec-
ture lined up this term is presented
by Dr Chris Evans, widely regarded
as one of the most s u c c e s s f u l
biotechnology entrepreneurs in the
UK, his lecture is entitled 'Biotech:
the coming revolution'. This lecture
is on Tuesday 12th December at
6.30pm and is probably in the Read
Lecture Theatre. Admission is free
and refreshments will be provided
after the lecture. Both lectures have
a limited capacity and are likely to
be highly popular. Please arrive
early to avoid disappointment.
Thank you,
Andrew Parker,
Biochemistry Society President

Do you remember the Union Curry? For those of
you who Have only joined us this year, allow me to
describe to you this strange beast.
Part rice, part spice and part miscellaneous meat
o r
veg, the Union Curry has been a staple food-
stuff for generations of IC students. Nutritious
and occasionally delicious, the Union Curry pro-
vided the IC student with their daily dosage of
carbohydrates, proteins, fat and baby sweetcorn
Specially baby sweetcorn).
Every lunch and dinnertime, there was a choice
between the visually attractive vegetable curry or
, n e
clearly labelled but otherwise unidentifiable
^eat curry. They were cheap and cheerful and
n |
ce in their own special way, and never failed to
s
Park off a conversation speculating on the exact
origin of various components of these culinary
masterpieces. There seemed to be no limits to
what qualified to become the basis for a Union
Curry. Peas, carrots, lamb, mushrooms, potatoes,
turkey, baby sweetcorn (and something that we
are fairly sure was parsnip (you're not even close
-Ed) ) ail made it into the mix.
They weren't haute cuisine, but they were ours
and we liked them. And union catering has cut us
off cold turkey. Citing financial constraints (the
Union Curry was a loss making venture apparent-
ly, but what could be cheaper to produce than a
curry?), they have killed the curry and replaced it
with daily specials. I am all for choice, but what
about those of us who want to choose curry?
More to the point, how's a student supposed to
prepare for a night on the beers with a baguette
or a jacket potato?
Well some of us have decided that the time has
come to take action. W e have launched an online
petition at www.icu-curries.com, demanding the
return of the Union Curry. Our hope is that with
enough signatures, union catering will reverse
their decision and bring it back. Why should you
sign it?. Because you too want to see the return
of the glorious Union Curry of course! But we
also have an added incentive...
Win beer. There, I said it
After hearing of our plight, the nice folks at Cobra
Beer have offered to supply not a bottle, not a
crate, but an entire Y E A R S S U P P L Y of Cobra
Beer to the IC student who comes up with the
most original and compelling argument to bring
back the Union Curry. S o don't delay, register
your vote today at www.icu-curries.com - and
don't forget to tell your friends.
