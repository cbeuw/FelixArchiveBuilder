An Englishman in New York
Editorial
I For those who do read the book reviews
j§u have probably spotted that there aren't
II
any this week. The simple reason for this is
that I've decided to take a break from London
and come to the relative peace and quiet
which is N e w York City.
Having never been abroad before it was
quite an experience on the British Airways
flight to J F K , the food w a s edible and only
once or twice did I imagine us plummeting
mo the Atlantic O c e a n . O n e small point, if
you're on an airplane which crashes what use
is a little whistle and torch (unless you hap-
pen to crash into a disco or club I guess).
After a 7 hour
flight, my f i r s t
moments on t h e y c a r r y g u n s !
American s o i l
were spent going through customs, waiting
half an hour for my luggage (the excuse being
that the cargo doors would not open due to
the cold weather) and staring at the airport
police-officers thinking "this is so like televi-
sion, they really carry Guns!"
After a quick bus ride (the time by now was
approaching midnight) I had my first experi-
ence of the N Y s u b w a y . First point, I was
scared, it w a s late a n d I w a s travelling
through B r o o k l y n . S e c o n d l y , it makes the
London Underground look like Virgin's First
class train carriages. The N Y subway is dis-
gusting, the stations look like level one of
Huxley and the trains (which do run through
the night) are very infrequent. The price is
fair though, $1.50 for any journey regardless
of where it's to.
After a g o o d - n i g h t s s l e e p in the hostel
(saving money to spend on shopping) on top
°f a bunk bed (that was an experience and a
half) it was time to do N e w York.
First things first, I went to Times Square-
Sroadway (a sight which during the day is
l m
pressive but is spectacular at night) and
b
°oked a show (well three to be precise),
forbidden B r o a d w a y on S u n d a y evening,
p
hantom on M o n d a y a n d J e k y l l and Hyde
Starring David Hasselhoff, you know the one
° u t
of Bay-watch, the one without the large
9'ands) on Tuesday. M o s t of Saturday was
s
Pent walking (so much more of an eye-open-
e r
than t a k i n g t h e s u b w a y e v e r y w h e r e )
r o u
n d going "Oh, I recognise that" or looking
at my p o p up m a p (I so love playing the
tourist).
S u n d a y morning I got up early and pro-
ceeded downtown to South Ferry. From there
I took the free ferry to Staten Island which
g i v e s an e x c e l l e n t v i e w of the S t a t u e of
Liberty on the outward journey and of the N Y
skyline on the way back. A s it was misty and
raining the sight of Lady Liberty was one I'll
never forget, no wonder this symbol is such a
source of comfort and hope to so many in
this country.
That e v e n i n g F o r b i d d e n B r o a d w a y w a s
excellent. For those who don't know, F B is a
humourous look at the muscicals and shows
T h i S iS S O l i k e t e l e v i s i o n , b
Y parodying the music
H
a n d s t a r s . T h e
service and food
in t h e t h e a t r e
(the Ellen Stardust) was superb, my bill only
came to just over $1 1 but I gave $15 (I never
know what to tip and I'm such a sucker for a
dashing and charming waiter).
Before coming to N e w York, some people
told me that the people in shops and restau-
rants were rude and unfriendly. I have found
this to be untrue . What I have witnessed is
that if y o u s a y " T h a n k - y o u " t h e c o m m o n
r e s p o n s e is a
s m i l e a n d " Y o u r
w e l c o m e " .
Showing, that if your pleas
ant to them they are cordial
back.
The usual tourist things have followed: The
W o r l d Trade C e n t e r (which holds probably
the best B o r d e r s there is, oh and two big
s k y s c r a p e s ) , W a l l S t r e e t (no big d e a l , a
r a t h e r i n f e r i o r B a n k O f
E n g l a n d / T h r e a d n e e d l e S t ) , R o c k e r f e l l e r
C e n t e r (I have found that I can't skate and
my ass will be hurting for weeks), M a c y s and
Bloomingdales (Macys is the largest shop in
the world but I thought it looked like a large
b r a n c h of D e b e n h a m s , m e n will h a t e it,
women (because of the perfum and smelly
stuff) will love it).
A bit about books. N e w york does indeed
have a n u m b e r of very i m p r e s s i v e b o o k s
shops and smaller specialist ones. B a r n e s
and Nobles is the main chain, a bit like our
Waterstones, and like Waterstones can be a
II
bit hit and miss. S o m e branches are excellent
with a wide range but some (especially the so
called "largest book shop on earth" on 5th
avenue) could be selling socks for the amount
of i n t e r e s t it g e n e r a t e s f o r b o o k f a n s
(Waterstones on Piccadilly, I hope your lis-
tening the same goes for you!). Specialists
and second-hand places are everywhere but I
do w a n t to m e n t i o n o n e , " M y s t e r i o u s
Bookshop" on 56th street has everything for
the thriller and crime fiction fan (i.e. me), the
member of staff was so pleasant I wanted to
take her home with me.
New York is very expensive. The shows on
Broadway are almost double what you would
pay in the W e s t - E n d , junk food and restau-
rants are unbelievable priced but electrical
goods are very cheap, A word of warning, all
prices in N e w York are without tax (8.5%) so
be careful, the price on the label is not the
price your'l! be paying.
Be c a r e f u l of the t o i l e t s e s p e c i a l l y the
flushes they are very powerful, I only mention
this because I lost a very nice silver pen in
Borders and before I realised it had fell out of
my pocket it was probably being sucked into
the Brooklyn river.
In my eyes N Y is a great city, but for me
O n c e y O U V e S e e n t e n L o n d o n h a s t h e e d g e
„ l „ . . ' . • m London has more
s k y s c r a p e r s y o u v e •
J m history (which is
r e f l e c t e d in our
buildings and parks) and
N e w Y o r k tries to c o m p e n s a t e with s k y -
s c r a p e s and i m p r e s s i v e c o n s t r u c t i o n s ; for
some it works but for me once you've seen 10
skyscrapes you've seen them all (I won't be
applying for my green card yet, the chances
are I w o u l d n ' t g e t it a n y w a y ) . N e w Y o r k
(especially around the theatre district and up
to central park south) is like the area around
Tottenham Court Rd and Centre Point, very
nice in some areas but it has a slight dirty
luck and too much neon lighting can be rather
tacky.
I h a v e to g e t g o i n g n o w . I h a v e a r e d
Y a n k e e s baseball hat to find and I have to
think up a w a y of bringing about 40 to 50
books back with me. I will return next week
with more book reviews if they let me back in
the country.
