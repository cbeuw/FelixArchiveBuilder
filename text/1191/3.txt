Indian society show blighted as anti-Indian Government
{protests infiltrate show
[SEAN M O O R E
Last Thursday I C U Indian S o c i e t y held their
[annual East M e e t s W e s t s h o w . In t h e b i g g e s t
(event in College, the this year's show saw over 800
ale, including over 150 participants, take part
[in the sold-out event. The show included various
dances, c a t w a l k s , c o m e d y s k e t c h e s , a n d live
singing from both eastern and western cultures.
Some of the most artistically talented students set
out to display that Imperial w a s not just about
studying. Including a gracious catwalk and a very
lively bollywood dance many present described it
as a thoroughly e n j o y a b l e night. H o w e v e r , the
event was marred by a number of a t t a c k s from
unknown groups, a p p a r e n t l y trying to bring t h e
show into disrepute.
According to organ
jjers, the philosophy o f | |
:he evening was repre-
sented by n u m e r o u s
eastern a n d w e s t e r n
jets, showing, "a har-
monious unity of t h e
iiverse c u l t u r e s " .
However, r i g h t f r o m
the b e g i n n i n g
became apparent that
m i n o r i t y w e r e
[attempting to use the night
Is an opportunity for racial
[and religious demonstrations. After they were dis-
tributed on seats in the G r e a t Hall, many of the
official programmes for the event (some two hun-
dred) had pamphlets inserted in them without the
organisers' knowledge. The professionally-printed
pamphlets complained of apparent abuse of non-
Hindu's in India. Q u e s t i o n i n g the Indian g o v e r n -
ment's human rights record, the leaflets accused
ia's "Nazi G o v e r n m e n t " of "Ethnic cleansing".
Jatil Damania, V i c e President of the Indian Society
condemned t h e protest a s a "cowardly attack",
adding that it was "we do not dispute freedom of
expression, but it was completely against the ethos
of the evening and was inappropriate to the situa-
tion."
Even before T h u r s d a y night, t h e s o c i e t y h a d
[complained that, a s with their last three events,
their posters had been interfered with. Organisers
had printed 150 colour posters, at a cost of £400,

only to find that within twenty-four hours that the
majority had been ripped down and ruined.
The society has suffered from similar vandalism
for a number of months, a n d consequently have
found it very hard to publicise events. Though IC
security was briefed on the situation, the perpetra-
tors have yet to be found. The cost to the Indian
society (one of the largest socs in IC) is estimated
to be in excess of a thousand pounds altogether.
What has worried security and the show organis-
ers s o d e e p l y is t h e well o r g a n i s e d a n d m a s s
o r c h e s t r a t e d nature of this latest a t t a c k . T h e
leaflets were professionally designed a n d a f e w
h u n d r e d s n e a k e d in p a s t U n i o n s t e w a r d s .
Organisers appeared mystified that two hundred
leaflets had been inserted in the programs, despite
the G r e a t Hall having
a p p a r e n t l y b e e n left
a t t e n d e d f o r " a b o u t

response had been received as Felix went to press.
The leaflet also referred to a report called "India-
Torture, Rape & D e a t h s in C u s t o d y " by A m n e s t y
International, which is not available among the
many reports on the Indian G o v e r n m e n t by t h e
human rights watchdog.

show, which raised approximately £3000 for chari-
ty. The atmosphere at the after show party was
described as "electric" and organisers praised the
"enormous" response to the show. However, the
attempt to jeopardise East M e e t s W e s t serious
questions as to whom or what organisation could
be behind the persecution of the society.
