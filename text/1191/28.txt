Well, just a little bit from me today, 'cos I seem to have been
seriously usurped by Wailer. Anyway, I will tell you that Chr
Toffis has won this week, and he is the lucky winner of (and
this is what comes if you go shopping with the DPE&W) a
pair of rubber hand-cuffs, a book by Lily Savage, and a CD
of 'It's Raining Men' sung by RuPaul, and one of the original
Weather Girls (whose name I forget). So yes, it's your own
fault for being so clever, and knowing too much sex-stuff. I
know your friends will laugh. Turnip.
Hello, it's Ned again. I trust you're not too corrupted. If

by any of the clues. The prize this week is a surprise - I'"1
sure it will be a pleasant surprise, but there's so much mys-
tery involved even I don't know what it is. It might be 3
Womble outfit for the end-of-term Cult TV carnival - read
next week to find out! In any case, please do submit your

feeling to know that somebody does them (apart from the
people who yell out the answers in the Maths common-roon1
every Monday...). Despite Turnip's protestations about writ'
ing last week's, he enjoys it really, so I'm sure we'll be heat'
ing from him soon. However, a little birdie tells me that w
e
may have the privilege of one of the new compilers to assisj
us with next week's - the last crossword before Christmas
In the meantime, however, enjoy. Ned.
