E
ye Contact had a l r e a d y
attracted a w a v e of tabloid
publicity - here was a chance to
catch m o d e l , c o v e r girl and
(allegedly) n e a r - i l l i t e r a t e B i g
Breakfast presenter Kelly Brook in
a new play dealing with the phe-
nomenon of table dancing clubs.
The production is a look into the
"sexual dynamics" of this world -
and, to its credit, certainly manages
to stay a comfortable notch above
late-night Channel 5 material.
Kelly Brook plays Anya, a brassy
table d a n c e r in " F a n t a s y
International", a L o n d o n table-
dancing club that is struggling to
pull in the punters. M e a n w h i l e ,
Hugo (Keir Charles) is a hedonis-
tic, high-flying City banker who is
besotted with Anya, and is besot-
ted to the extent that he repeat-
edly tries to move their relation-
ship to the world outside the club
- Anya however is having none of
it and the play is an exploration of
the flirtatious interplay between
the two - will she concede, or will
Hugo have to be satisfied with a
dance to end his evening?
Now all of this has great potential
to be supremely boring, but the nar-
rative is punctuated with several
sub-plots which add to the psycho-
logical tension. Subplots include
the dealings of the depraved and
frustrated club owner, and also
Hugo's colleague, the stiff family
man Philip, who also b e c o m e s
involved with the club.
Contrasting with the three strong
main characters (Hugo, Anya and
Philip), some of the lesser charac-
ters are somewhat wooden and
are let down badly by the script
which at times throws up cliche
after cliche. Kelly Brook shows
she can actually act and is the real
star of the play, while Keir Charles
puts in a g o o d p e r f o r m a n c e ,
slightly marred by occasional over-
acting but still making his charac-
ter likeable in its pathos. Terence
Booth is also fabulous as the con-
servative and staid City gent.
There is some nudity (all four of
the girls have a brief turn at the
pole, with Kelly Brook at the cli-
max), but it is brief and certainly
not t a c k y or g r a t u i t o u s . Then
again, this isn't exactly intellectual
fodder, remaining a glamour show
at heart. So go see. (But is it art?

From the mouths of (freshers)
come the wisdom of kings.
The format is simple; the new blood
to the drama society performs a
series of short plays or extracts,
staged annually in Gladys.
There is no central t h e m e ; the
plays are chosen entirely at the
discretion of individual directors,
making for a s u i t a b l y d i v e r s e
evening. The audience sat around
candle-lit tables, drinking wine and
eating nibbles, and the atmosphere
was relaxed and friendly.
The first play, an excerpt from
M i c h a e l Frayn's Copenhagen,
explored the wartime relationship of
Heisenberg and Bohr, two physicists
from opposing sides, discussing the
possibilities of an atomic bomb... this
complex piece with its mixed mes-
s a g e s was strongly a c t e d , and
served as a stimulating introduction
to the evening.
Crazy.For You was not a Gershwin
musical, but an excellent concept
play, in the form of a series of psy-
chiatrist and patient consultations.
The twist here is that the patient
comes to realise that she is in a
play - under the lights, with people
watching, and aware of the true
passage of time... Audio represent-
ing the doctor's thoughts, and light-
ing were used to great effect to
add to the ingenious work per-
formed here.
Mother Figure by Alan Ayckbourne
was the third play. An unsuspel £
ing couple drop round to visit the
new neighbour - but as the coupl; m
squabble and bicker like children .j
the n e i g h b o u r b e g i n s to treaiH
them accordingly. What seems t;| G
