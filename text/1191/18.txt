Doves and Turin Brakes
Live @ Empire
Turin Brakes have no delusions of
their destiny and fate in the evil
world of music, they know that there
not the next Travis or Coldplay. You
see, they lack attitude, a beautiful
front person and most of all they just
aren't plain loud enough. What they
do have is an abundance of charm,
sweet acoustic melodies and the
ability to turn hauntingly angst when
they please. Take, Mind over Money
for example, an example of there
mini folk Radiohead tendencies. A
band to keep an eye on, but proba-
bly b e s t l i s t e n e d to on r e c o r d .
Whereas with Doves, their electrify-
ing live show surpasses even the L P ,
Lost S o u l s , a sure c o n t e n d e r for
album of the year.
To cap the D o v e s best y e a r yet,
they sell out the Empire two nights
running, get the pick of the bands
"who are mostly likely" to support
them, then turn in a blistering set of
blood, sweat and guitar majesty.
Songs like Sea Song and Here it
Comes, are given time and space to
d e v e l o p and s o a r . F r o m B a d l y
D r a w n B o y ' s b a c k i n g band to a
Mercury nomination in under two
years, the Doves are here to enjoy
themselves. Utilising stunning visu-
als, ranging from short pretenscious
films to hynotic swirls, the band fully
entrance the audience for the whole-
set. The Doves are sure to do well in
all the end of year polls, you could
do a lot worse than putting their
album L o s t S o u / s on y o u r
Christmas List.
With M o r g a n , it really is a
family affair. L o o k o v e r
there on the drums, that's his lit-
tle brother, oh and on the left
with a tambourine that's Uncle
M o r g a n , and there are his sis-
ters, in the middle, singing and
s t e a l i n g the p r a i s e . W h i c h is
unfair, as the gangly, unassum-
ing Morgan sits to the side with
his box of t r i c k s , g u i d i n g his
f a m i l y t h r o u g h his own b e a t s
and pop/jazz combinations. The
glorious Miss Parker, is followed
w i t h the s u m m e r y s h i m m y of
Sitting in the Sun, as the party
a t m o s p h e r e s c o n t i n u e s ,
o n w a r d s , but not b e f o r e an
interval with...
C o m i c extrordinaire, J o n n y
Vegas, who is here, to be quite
f r a n k l y , a bit c r a p . O n l y o n e
other thing must be mentioned,
fat old men really shouldn't strip
in front of 6000 people, no mat-
ter w h a t s u m of m o n e y is
involved. Which after that dour
interval, on an otherwise night
of celebration, brings us to the
headliners. O n c e , a poor man's
O a s i s , a band that could play
the right tunes, but never really
hit the target. But this year has
been different, the band have
m a t u r e d , g r o w n r e l a x e d a n d
more confident, songs that use
to drag and die out, now lift and
drive. E m b r a c e , really are the
full package now, a very British
rock band. Ignore the fact that
any half wit can sing better than
Danny, just feel the atmosphere
a n d dig t h o s e g r o o v e s . T h e y
bang out all the hits, we all sing
along and it's lovely, no alarms
and no surprises. With Embrace,
you get exactly what it says on
the tin, with no pseudo-art toss
guitar wank. For every Tortoise
a l b u m y o u o w n , y o u n e e d
Embrace style sing-a-long indie
a n t h e m s to b a l a n c e y o u r life.
They play Save Me, Hooligan,
One Big Family et al. A s Danny
Macnamara struts and nods, and
grows into a prince among front
men, everyone helps the band
r a i s e the roof. The lads from
L e e d s prove that a n y o n e can
play guitar, and no matter who
you are, if you have the tunes
and some soul, it might just be
you playing in such venues given
a couple of years.
E m b r a c e will be lying low
for the next f e w m o n t h s , but
make sure you check them out
next year, they'll surprise you. A
quality night of cabaret.

Ben Okafor
Coffee With Lazarus
(Plankton)
Now, there's a definite conflict
interests in Ben Okafor's music. Q
the one hand we have some of tti
smoothest reggae you're likely
hear. It might be a touch overprt
duced but it's still excellent chill 0
1
fodder for when you've been canirt
it too much. Yet on the other hant
we have these absolutely appallini
lyrics that seem to have been writ
ten the night before old Ben's hai
to hand them in (come on, yoi
know what I mean) to his recoil
label. It shouldn't matter that h
e
'
s
talking utter crap, after all if t
h
e
Manic Street Preachers can maki
a career of it then so can Okafor
Indeed, if it is the Saturday nigh:
stoners that he's catering for then'
he's perfect: you could talk bollock
about these lyrics 'til dawn.
Dope Smugglaz
Dope Radio
(Perfecto/Mushroom)
Dope Smugglaz first album, riddled
with loads of samples from the likes
of classical music to Mark Goodiefs
voice, it makes it a very varied lis-
ten. Their idea was to make an
album that could be listened to
many times, with many layers to
each song so every time you experl
"
ence something different. To me, it
hasn't the depth of an album such a
s
Moby Play, but it has the ability to
grow on you. With some funky gul
"
tar riffs splashed about big beats it
has songs that easily entertain, ^
then it has others that just get
annoyinq.
