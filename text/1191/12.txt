Skyscrapers and palm readers
After having successfully crossed India, Felix travel writers Jon and Liz arrive in H o n g
Kong to admire the temples, of both the religious and capitalist variety
Arriving straight from India, Hong Kong's
s t a g g e r i n g t e c h n o l o g y w a s all the m o r e
shocking. The train that sped us from the air-
port into the city centre w a s clean, deadly
silent and amazingly quick. Efficiency howev-
er comes at a price and it was immediately
evident that Hong Kong w a s going to be a
challenging city to see on a budget.
Jet lagged we stumbled out of our hotel
room in the early evening onto Nathan road
to find the s t r e e t s j r m
still a w a s h w i t h
s h o p p e r s . P e o p l e
rushed busily along
the never-ending e x p a n s e s of shops with a
s e e m i n g l y i n s a t i a b l e d e s i r e to s p e n d .
Everywhere we looked neon signs hung off
towering buildings while the noise of traffic
h a m m e r e d out a d e a f e n i n g beat to w h i c h
everyone but ourselves moved in harmony.
For a while we walked a little lost within the
jungle of skyscrapers so in order to find our
bearings we decided to head to Victoria peak
where a s t o n i s h i n g v i e w s a c r o s s the cities
harbour were promised.
W e took the funicular railway up the steep
sided hill face and like every other visitor to
Hong Kong, stood hypnotised at the bewil-
d e r i n g night v i e w of the c i t y s c a p e .
Developers have, rather predictably, decided
to build a shopping complex at the peak but
the view from the rooftop out across the har-
bour was sensational, we could see for miles.

Every light from the whole city stood
before us; it was undoubtedly one of
the highlights of our trip so far.
A s we only had a few days in Hong
Kong, we were up early the next day
and headed for the Y u e n Po S t Bird
Garden in search of cheap entertain-
ment. Our guide book informed us that
the C h i n e s e have long favoured birds
as pets, a fact that was obvious when

hand fed live grasshoppers using, chopsticks
and if s i n g i n g ability is any sign of g o o d
health then all the birds were well looked
after. The market was busy, mostly with old
men looking for a feathered friend to pass
the hours with and we spent an interesting
morning wandering the narrow lanes.

have our fortunes read. It is staggeringly hard
to miss out on something when you know the
chances are you'll never be back. You always
feel, "if I don't do it now, I'll never get the
chance," which happens a lot while travelling
(and always s e e m s to cost us money). Al
e l d e r l y lady, using all s o r t s of confusing
charts and books, deciphered the lines on our
hands.
She worked out that we were going to be
very lucky until we were forty three, that we
would be retired by the age of fifty and that

Feeling guilty about our extravagant spend-
