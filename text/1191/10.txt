T h e m o u n t a i n m e d i c : H y p o t h e r m i a
MATT K A P L A N
Considering the fact that last week's Felix
focused on campus medical care I only think it
appropriate that we explore the question of
wilderness medical care here in the science sec-
tion. So this is the first of several articles which
will consider what to do when the forever valiant
Dr. Weinreb and her team of talented physicians
are not available to tackle urgent problems that
develop when you are far away from medical
care facilities.
So you might ask, what the hell does the sci-
ence editor of Felix know about wilderness med-
icine? Well for starters let me be very clear that
I am N O T a doctor, I am what in America is
called an emergency medic (I think you call them
paramedics here in Britain). Anyhow, I started
my training on ambulance rigs and eventually
started work placement in the triage division of
the Sacramento California emergency room. I
worked with a lot of urban injuries, stabbings,
automobile accidents, drug addictions, and quite
a lot of gun shot injuries (silly gun legislation in
the states). Eventually I got interested in doing
back country search and rescue, it seemed a lot
more exciting to me, and I upgraded my medical
training through several module c o u r s e s to
include wilderness medicine. I have now worked
as the medical director of the Royal G o r g e
Wilderness Medical Lodge in Lake Tahoe, C a . ,
as the medic for several river rafting expeditions
on the American River (I myself am a rafting
guide), and as the
medic on multiple
backpacking treks
in U . S . national
parks.
But e n o u g h
about my training,
lets get t a l k i n g
about neat stuff
like environment
induced hypother-
mia, lightning
strikes, drownings,
and trauma. The
best way to com-
municate how to
deal with such sit-
uations is a l s o
perhaps the most
i n t e r e s t i n g , and
this is through the
telling of a few stories. Names in my stories
have been changed for purposes of privacy.
With the winter holidays just around the corner
it seems appropriate to consider cold illness this
week, so lets talk hypothermia.
I was trekking through Yellowstone National
Park with five friends
during m i d - O c t o b e r |
nearly two y e a r s
ago. The w e a t h e r
had been cool, but
above freezing dur-
ing the day time and
well below freezing
at night. O n ourfjlf
fourth night in the
back c o u n t r y we
unloaded our packs
to set up camp and Ij
n o t i c e d that one
m e m b e r of our
group, Jane, started
acting a bit... reclu-
sive. A s I watched
her behaviour, I grew
more and more con-
cerned, she just did-
n't look right. It's not
that "reclusiveness" on its own is indicative of
some sort of medical problem, however the
presence of a behavioural change certainly is. I
didn't do anything at the time, and in retrospect I
should have been more vigilant, because nearly
two hours later when I was heating up a kettle
of water for some coffee I watched as Jane was
helped out of her tent by her boyfriend, Mark.
She was quivering uncontrollably, having terrible
difficulty manoeuvering, and slurring some of her
s p e e c h . I had only read about m o d e r a t e
hypothermia in class, but I instantly knew that
this was it. Mark placed her by the fire and
encouraged her to try to warm up, it didn't work.
The ambient temperature was well below freez-
ing and the fire was not large enough to do her a
bit of good, it was then that I stepped in.
Before I go any further I should comment o
r
the different types of hypothermia. There a
r
e
three major categories; mild, moderate, a
n
d
severe. Mild hypothermics tend to be a bit dis-
oriented , cool to the touch, uncoordinated, ait
usually shiver. Moderate hypothermics areverj
cold to the touch, shiver lots, often noticeafci
mentally altered, and have terrible trouble m

extreme care, I'll explain this in greater detar
later. Now there are a lot of different methods]
of dealing with mild and moderate hypothecs
in the wilderness, but there is a central theme|
GET T H E M W A R M ! This may sound simple, bj
when you are out in freezing temperatures wit!
no shelter around this is not always an easj
task.
I brought Jane back inside her tent and I
Mark put her in a sleeping bag. I collected sorm
water bottles, filled them with the warm « •
from the kettle which was on the fire, and p"|
pared to make what is so eloquently known as
human burrito. I took a warm water bottle a
placed it inside the sleeping bag and wrapped'
up against the bottoms of Jane's feet, wrapP*|

and stuck a couple of wool hats on her I
considered sticking her boyfriend in the s\(
