Described by Alex James of
the band Blur as 'the origi-
nal Soho nutcase,' William
Blake, poet, printer and author
of that rousing hymn
Jerusalem, was born just off
Golden Square in the late
November of 1757. The
American and French Revo-
lutions were to follow, yet all
Mr Blake managed for the next
70 years, until his death in
1827, was to churn out an end-
less series of insipid pictures
from his print shop in Lambeth.
Blur and Blake do actually have
something in common. They
both attempt to recapture the
English past; for Blur it is the
cheeky-chappy Brit style popu-
larised by The Kinks; for Blake
it was a ye olde Canterbury
Tales pastiche of the
Mediaeval. Mr Blake's bulky
printing press, source of all this
pseudo-Mediaeval malarkey,
sits at the centre of the exhibi-
tion like an instrument of tor-
ture - and it does a good job
inflicting boring Blake upon the
Tate punters.
Much of the work is religious,
with countless, sometimes inter-
esting, even modern (the series
for Dante's Inferno) prints but
more often degenerating into
rather ridiculous allegory.
The truth is that this exhibition
would be better served outside
the Tate, in a smaller museum
in the provinces (how about the
dusty but spectacular Fitz-
william in Cambridge?). Since
much of the fine art in the Tate
has been shipped to Tate
Modern, Tate Britain is now in
transition and sadly bereft of
purpose. The exhibiition is
clearly an attempt to reconfig-
ure the PR image away from
modern international art. But
the Blake is not good enough
to do this, and anyway, it all
sits uncomfortably with the
Cool Britannia of the Turner
Prize (in the adjacent gallery).
With the £32 million revamp of
Tate Britain continuing apace
(due for completion in 2001),
we can only hope Sir Nicholas
Serota (Director of Tate) wakes
up to the disastrous Blake mis-
fire currently splattering over
his gallery. Tate Britain could
and should do better.

Turner - T h e Great W a t e r c o l o u r s
Royal Academy of Art
To mark the 150th anniversary
of the death of Turner, the
R
°yal Academy of Art is holding a
commemorative exhibition of his
Wa
tercolour works. There are
0 v e
r a hundred pieces here from
Minute sketches to large commis-
Sl
°ns, chronicling his entire life's
Wor
k. The RA has put particular
effort into this show, with loans
from both UK and US collections,
a fitting tribute to one of their
most illustrious students.
Initially, the exhibition seems like
any other, with the first room
being mainly his early sketches.
His early work shows a keen
architectural awareness, with the
buildings being rendered in
minute detail, a marked contrast
to the later watercolours and oils.
In the second room holds paint-
ings that are definitively Turner.
Atmospheric, dramatic scenes
with turbulent wild skies are
prevalent, impressions hinted at
with only the barest detail. Dark
hues in some of the more disturb-
ing storm paintings contrast
strongly with the calm serenity of
the dawn and dusk scenes. All
these paintings have an added
level of subtlety, with the water-
colour washes sometimes betray
the care and attention that have
been lavished on each piece.
The series entitled Picturesque
Views in England and Wales is
considered to be some of the finest
British landscapes ever made, and
some of the larger compositions
are very impressive - these con-
trast with some pieces that would-
n't look out of place on a chocolate
box. I'm sure distinguished art crit-
ics will be crying out after reading
this, but I don't know much about
art, and I know what I like.
There are some striking larger
pieces in the third room (is the
strongest of the three), accompa-
nied by some verse written by the
artist himself. The exhibition in
general is a good view of Turner's
watercolour work, but I find it dif-
ficult to recommend, because of
the scandalous five-pound entry
fee for students, and because
Turner's more familiar work is far
better represented for free in the
Tate Britain.
