Bleak House
The future looks bleak for married
students with children at the Imperial
College Field Station at Silwood
Park. Eleven flats, almost completely
occupied by overseas families, will be
lost when Sandyride House and its
cottages are sold.
College has proposed to use the
money obtained from the sale, and a
£10,000 loan to build two new blocks
of accommodation. One block will
comprise of 6 two-bedroom flats and
the other will contain 14 study
bedrooms.
The Union Silwood Park Working
Party on the future development has
expressed its concern to College about
the loss of family accommodation and
claims that the decision is biased
against overseas students. They point
out in their report that 70% of the
overseas students at Silwood are
married and over 75% of the married
students have children. At present. 10
families live outside Silwood. at
distances of upto 30 miles due to the
inflated rents around the site. The
Working Party also has questioned the
need for more single student
accommodation as the Silwood
population has been decresing due to
the loss of Ashurst Lodge. It has been
suggested that accommodation for the
Technology Tranfer Centre's short
course students should be provided by
the College and that the true purpose
behind the extra single
accommodation is for this reason.
Current long term students are housed
in second rate accommodation.
The Union has proposed in the
Working Party's report to College
that long term students should be
moved to the new block and the old
blocks refurbished and used to house
the short course students. They also
want to see the farm converted into
flats for married students with
children to replace those lost in the
Sunnyride sale.
Mr Hector Cameron Clark. Head
of Estates Section at Silwood Park,
told FELIX that the College were not
required to provide accommodation
for married students. This is a UGC
decision and College are only
following this judgement.
Not cricket at Sussex
Sussex University Student Union is
under attack from the college
administration, which aims to take
full control of student funding. The
move follows a ten day occupation of
the university administration building,
Sussex House, by a group of nearly
fifty students. The students were
protesting about cuts at the university,
which would involve 90 job losses,
the closure of libraries, and the
closure of the post graduate school.
A spokesman for the union
admitted that during the course of the
demonstration nearly three thousand
pounds worth of damage was caused,
but added that this was confined to
doors which had been forced on
entry, and filing cabinets which were
broken open at a later stage. The
contents of these cabinets were found
to include files on politically active
students at the university. All the
students involved in the action now
face disciplinary hearings, and could
face penalties ranging from a £100
fine to expulsion from the university.
As a result of the incident, the
union was fined £74,000 by the
university administration, which has
left them with no funding for the
remainder of this year. The union is
financed on a monthly basis from the
college, under the control of the
university's finance officer. The
heavy tine imposed means that the
union is now effectively bankrupt.
The council of Sussex is said to be
intent on stamping out "destructive
student militancy", as revealed in a
letter sent out to all students and staff
from Sir Denys Wilkinson, the Vice
Chancellor, .and Sir Anthony
Trafford. chairman of the council.
The council is planning wide ranging
changes to the union constitution to
give it full control of where the union
spends its money. Mr Alan Simpson,
union Vice President, is reported as
saying, "The most important outcome
of these proposals will be that students
will no longer be able to decide which
activities should be supported."
The aim of these financial measures
as seen by the university is "to see
that more of the funds are used to
support societies and sports activities
rather than general political activity."
Sussex Union has set up the Falmer
Fighting Fund to provide finance for
the rest of the year and
demonstrations are planned to
coincide with the forthcoming NUS
Easter Conference. When contacted,
the Sussex union spokesman was
playing cricket. "There's not a lot
else to do with no money about,"
Coffee break
Coffee machines in Geology, Elec
Eng and the RSM common room
were broken into last Friday
lunchtime. FELIX spoke to RSMU
coffee machine attendant, Suresh
Thalange, about the raid in which
£100. a weeks takings, were stolen.
A man who left the vending
company under suspicious
circumstances was identified to police
as being seen around the RSM that
lunchtime. RSMU have not been
notified of any developments yet.
Zzzzzzzzzzzz-
The Royal College of Science Union
Hustings took place yesterday
lunchtime in front of a packed
audience. Several hundred people did
not turn up to witness nine interesting
and varied election speeches given by
nine interesting and varied people.
The post of President is being
contested between David Jones
(Physics) and Clare McErlane
(Physics). Andy Pugh (Physics) and
Fiona Nicholas (Life Science) are
standing for Vice-President, Gordon
Brignal (Physics), Dave Smedley
(Physics) and Julian Moore (Physics)
are standing for Honorary Secretary.
The election is by College-wide
ballot next Monday.
Survey
The vast response to the IC Union
survey is causing severe problems in
processing the statistics. The current
bottleneck is entering data on to
computer file. The Student
Accommodation Office has only one
Rainbow Computer available for data
entry which means results may not be
fully entered until Easter. A report on
the results will be prepared by the
authors of the survey for sometime
next term.
