Letters. FELIX, Friday February 27th 1987 4
Garden mix
Dear Professor Ash,
I am writing to you on behalf of the
residents of Garden Hall to express
our dissatisfaction at this hall being
an all male residence.
It is a view widely held within
Garden Hall that the absecne of
female residents creates an artificial
atmosphere which is less pleasant to
live in than that of the other halls, all
of which are mixed. It is generally felt
that the presence of female residents
would phange this artificiality, since
women usually exert a pacifying,
civilising influence on others—as the
other halls show.
To demonstrate the depth of feeling
on this issue, I enclose a petition
signed by over 90% of the hall's
residents—an overwhelming
majority—who agreed that, in
principle, Garden Hall should cease
to be an all male hall of residence.
Of course, there are practical
conserations too. However, I am
assured by the hall's Subwarden, Mr.
Ivor Ellul, that he has already
considered the problems which would
arise and is satisfied they can be
solved.
The residents of Garden Hall have
made their views clear, and await
further developments with interest.
Yours sincerely,
David Bottomley (Garden Hall
reapplicant for 1987/88).
FELIX fails to
inform
Sir,
We would like to complain in the
strongest possible terms about the
inability of FELIX, and Imperial
College Union in general, to inform
students about anything occurring
outside the walls of this ivory tower,
known as Imperial College.
Last Saturday, around 25,000
students took part in a demonstration
to protest about the current state of
student finances. Although held in
London, students came from all parts
of the country, from as far away as
Scotland and Northern Ireland, to join
the march, which started at County
Hall and culminated in a rally held in
Hyde Park, only a quarter of a mile
away from Imperial.
However, there was no mention of
this major event in FELIX. Indeed,
ICU seemed totally unaware of it, and
consequently so were the vast
majority of students at IC. The first
we heard about it was when it was
reported on the peak time national
news on BBC1.
Admittedly, the rally was organised
by the NUS, of which Imperial,
rightly or wrongly, is not a part. But
surely the individual should be able
to decide whether or not to take part
in such a campaign, of the utmost
importance to the average student. It
is a severe indictment of the self-
centred attitude (or could it be
ineptitude) of ICU that they did not
know about this event, and so we
were denied the opportunity to
participate.
This is by no means the first time
that students at Imperial have been
unable to take part in organised
student gatherings, either on a
national scale, as in this case, or
simply for London based colleges,
because of the failure of ICU and its
relevant societies (eg Socialist
Society) to tell its members that they
are taking place.
Perhaps there was some official
representation by so-called 'Union
hacks.' But if ICU did know of the
rally, then surely the Union has
abdicated its responsibility to the
general body of students by keeping
this information from them. If they
did not know of such an important
expression of student views, then we
would question the effectiveness of
the Union as the representative body
of Imperial Students.
Yours faithfully,
Peter Othen, Physics II
Robin Choudbury, Physics II
Richard Whatmough, Chemistry II
Daniel Walker, Elec. Eng. PG.
Ed's note
My apologies for the lack of
publicity for this march. The reason
was very simple—/forgot about it. If
any of Messrs Othen, Choudbury,
Whatmough, or Walker would like to
join the FELIX news staff I would be
delighted to meet them—give me a
ring on 3515.
SUBWARDEN
Montpelier Hall
Applications are invited for the
post of Subwarden of
Montpelier Hall. The
Subwarden's duties are to
assist the Warden in the day to
day running of the Hall, and in
social and disciplinary matters.
In return, he/she will be
provided with rent-free
accommodation. The
successful candidate should be
a full-time post-graduate
student at Imperial College.
Applications/Enquiries to:
K e v i n O ' C o n n e r
The W a r d e n
Montpelier Hall
The closing date for
applications is March 6th 1987.
Because of the nature of the FELIX
editor's job, and my bad planning, I
frequently find myself returning to
Southside Hall at around 4-5am. This
is not something I choose to do. There
appear to be many IC students who
like nothing better than spending the
entire night-time watching their
friends playing space invaders. I can
just about see the attraction of trying
to zap the Martians/Venusians/
Uranians before you get zapped, but
how anyone can spend any length of
time watching someone else play
(sometimes in groups of around 12)
has yet to be explained to me. Perhaps
I am being too cynical (Impossible!—
typesetter); perhaps this particular
"IC intellect" is a result of too many
thermodynamics lectures. Either way,
the never-ending beeping from the
wretched Selkirk machine is
beginning to irritate me intensely, and
if some act of vandalism is perpetrated
against it in the next few weeks I will
probably be responsible.
Sabbatical Elections
Next week is the FELIX manifesto's
issue. All candidates must submit
copies of their manifestos by 10.00am
on Monday morning, with a photo if
they wish to have one printed. There
will be no question of late
submissions being included. Anyone
who still has not seen me about
publicity should do so as soon as
possible.
Credits
