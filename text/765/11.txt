Nicolas Roeg. director of Dew V Look
Now and Tlie Man Who Fell to Earth
has come up trumps once again with
his latest film Castaway starring
Oliver Reed and newcomer Amanda
Donohoe. The story begins with a
small ad in Time Out. Lucy Irvine
(Amanda Donohoe), discontented
with her job and life in London sees
the advertisement, "writer seeks
'wife' for year on tropical desert
island" and seizes the chance to fulfill
her dream of escape.
However Castaway is much more
than a film of sunshine, sea and idyllic
scenery. These are merely incidental
and what the story really focusses on
is the, relationship between Gerald
(Oliver Reed) and Lucy. Happy at
first in their new found freedom, they
soon realise that this Garden of Eden
is going to need a lot of weeding.
Gerald becomes frustrated by Lucy's
constant refusal of him sexually—a
refusal built on her own frustration at
his laziness. All this repressed sexual
tension is brought to a head by the
arrival on the island of two virile
Australian men.
Both Oliver Reed and Amanda
Donohoe give wonderful
performances. Reed as the eccentric
writer who takes great delight in
reciting crude limericks while reading
classics secretly, and Donohoe as the
independent yet confused Lucy,
prepared to go to any lengths to get
what she wants.
The film is packed full of imagery,
almost to the point of predictability,
but this adds to its appeal and along
with some wonderful photography,
superb scenery and great music make
it a film I would recommend going
to see.

Based on the controversial novel by
Lucy Irvine. Castaway is the story of
a middle-aged man. Gerald Kingsland
(Oliver Reed), who advertises in
search of a younger woman to spend
a year with him on a deserted tropical
island. He finds Lucy Irvine (Amanda
Revenue, she has a busy, tacky social
life. Gerald is looking for the 'right'
woman to accompany him, and
frequenting pubs. Life in London is
represented as fast and hectic. I
thought that when the scene moved on
to the island the pace of the film
T w o f a c e s of
" C a s t a w a y "
Donohoe), and they go. The
controversy caused by the novel arose
because it was thought that Irvine's
portrayal of Kingsland was unfair.
The film opens with a look at the
lives of Irvine and Kingsland in
London. Lucy works for the Inland
would relax, but this wasn't the case.
When the couple are finally left on
the island of Tuin, the film becomes
preoccupied with the fact that Lucy
won't have sex with Kingsland. This
is fair enough as this is also a
preoccupation of Irvine in the novel.
There is an attempt to give us
Kingsland's point of view on this
issue as well as Irvine's, which is fair
enough too. While Irvine is
gallivanting energetically around the
island, making love to the sun and
flirting with two young Australian he-
men who arrive to deliver the
Australian census forms, Kingsland
sits at 'home' sweetly looking after
his unproductive vegetable garden,
reading his one copy of a newspaper,
and a book on how to communicate
better, and, when it is available,
drinking beer. Whenever Lucy
returns home Gerald calls her a bitch
or tries to jump on top of her. But
despite all this the couple develop a
genuine affection for one another in
their efforts to survive.
The film tries to depict Irvine's
intense emotional reaction to Tuin,
and her frustration and sense of
failure when Kingsland gives up on
simply surviving and starts a business
with the friendly inhabitants of a
neighbouring island. The film tries
too hard to be interesting in what
seem to be inappropriate ways, that
is, it packs too much action in, and
in its attempt to be fair to both
characters, makes too much of the
character of Kingsland, he is
endearing but unoriginal. Being fair
is nice but it can be boring, the film
would have been better if it had given
more of Irvine's thoughts and left us
to make up our own minds about her
feelings toward Kingsland and the
island. At least then it would have had
a focus, as it is the film isn't sure
whether it is about getting on with
someone, lack of communication,
sexual frustration, age gaps, or
survival.

S o u t h A f r i c a
1 he media is full of news stories of
events in South Africa in the sea of
emotional response to apartheid. It is
rare to find a clear, cool account of
what the political trends in that
country are. In his book South Africa
Graham Leach. BBC Southern Africa
Radio correspondent, has produced
just that—an up-to-date guide to the
complex situation behind the events
in South Africa. He draws on his
experience on the front-line, and his
talks with key figures across the
political and racial divide to produce
a lively incisive account of recent
developments.
Mr Leach provides vital
background to South Africa's racial
cauldron—the Afrikaner, the whites
of British descent, the Zulus, the
Xhosa. the Swazi. the Ndebele and
the Sotho. He traces the rise of the
Afrikaner, the development of the so
called laager mentality, and the
eventual emergence of apartheid. The
Afrikaner, steeped in Calvanist
tradition, saw no reason to doubt that
apartheid was in keeping with
scripture, for every race and nation
would be performing the greatest
service to God and the world if it kept
its own attributes.
Mr Leach outlines the major pieces
of legislation under which petty and
grand apartheid policy was enforced.
He is. however, at his incisive best
in accounting the country's most
recent history—the changing face of
apartheid. He takes us through the
constitutional reforms, the schism that
occurred in the Ruling National Party,
the vehement opposition to such
reforms from the right-wing parties,
the emergence of the UDF, the
dilemma faced by Indians and
Coloureds in participating in Botha's
plans.
Mr Leach allows the reader to try
and assess whether the recent reforms
are really an indication that the
government is sincerely paving the
way towards peaceful change. Can
apartheid be dismantled peacefully or
is violent revolution inevitable? How
far would the whites be prepared to
move in surrendering their power?
What form will a solution need to
take? It seems that minorities would
want to receive guarantees that they
would not be disadvantaged,
suppressed or destroyed by the
majority. How could this be done?
Would a federal option be feasible?
Would the blacks accept anything less
than one-man, one-vote in a unitary
state? Mr Leach feels that at the end
of the day the most crucial factor for
the whites may prove to be not so
much the political guarantees they
would require, but rather assurances
about the nature of the economic
system which would apply under a
black-led government.
Does the slogan of Kwame
Nkrumah of Ghana—"Seek ye first
the political kingdom and all else will
follow"—apply? Surely, while
establishing political rights, economic
and other matters should not be
overlooked.
South Africa will remain a burning
issue for sometime. Do yourself a
favour and be better informed, about
the paradoxes and ironies of Africa's
richest land.

Arthur Miller has many hang-ups;
mother-complex, Jewish-guilt,
brushes with Communism etc, all of
which he inflicts upon semi-
autobiographical characters in his
plays. This makes good, serious
drama but also leaves the audience
with a strong sense of deja-vu.
The American Clock, at the
National Theatre, describes the
history of the USA since The
Depression of the 1930's whilst also
containing the 'usual' Miller themes.
The concept and staging is excellent
(although the continual use of the
revolving stage by the NT and RSC
is becoming dull) however, most of
Miller's subtle language and social
comment is drowned by the
incorporation of music and songs
from the period, and the camped up
acting required to fill the huge Olivier
auditorium.
The American Clock would make a
superb promenade show (in the style
of Road at the Royal Court) but
instead we have to make do with a
glossy, light, sleek musical show
destined for the West End.
