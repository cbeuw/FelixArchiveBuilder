s o u r c e s o f energy.
When the word 'energy' is mentioned
to you, any of a multitude of concepts
may spring to mind. If you are a
physicist, perhaps you immediately
think 'mc2
'; if you are a life
scientist, you may think of
photosynthesis, carbohydrates and the
Krebs cycle; electrical engineers
might go for kilowatt-hours, power
stations and transmission lines,
whereas mining students, at the sharp
end of the energy supply chain, will
probably think of energy in terms of
coal, oil, gas or possibly even
uranium.
I mention all these possibilities
simply to show that the work of
almost everyone at Imperial involves
energy in one or more of its
conceptual or physical forms. But
perhaps none of these ideas is the first
to enter your consciousness. If your
feet are firmly planted on the ground
and not halfway up the ivory tower
of scientific esotericism, the mention
of energy to you might conjure up
thoughts of that quarterly panic when
the gas or electricity bill land on your
doormat at the same time as the letter
from your bank manager. If this is the
case, then you are probably more
aware of the relevance of the energy
question to an average citizen than
any of those whose minds run on the
tracks of their chosen subject. Energy
is money: it is one of the four inputs
which govern all economic activity
(the others are labour, capital and raw
materials). To an economist, the value
of a potential energy source lies in its
ability to minimise costs.
What of the future?
So far, so good. But there is a great
danger in assuming that a
conventional economic analysis will
always provide the 'right' answer as
to which source of energy is best for
society. The reason for this can be
summed up in two words: future
uncertainty. To those without a
crystal ball, factors such as the price
of oil and future electricity demand
can, when projected into the future,
at best only have probabilities
assigned to them. And there are other
unknowns: public opinion in the wake
of nuclear accidents such as occurred
at Chernobyl; changes in the
government and resulting shifts in
energy strategy: future advances in
technology; the state of the world
economy—the list is endless. All this
makes the job of predicting the future
patterns of energy supply and demand
a particularly difficult and somewhat
subjective task.
A topical example illustrates the
problems involved. Those who have
taken an interest in the Sizewell
nuclear power station inquiry will
know that the report, published a few
weeks ago, expresses the economic
attractiveness of the pressurised water
reactor (PWR) as a probability: there
is a one in 20 chance of a coal-fired
power station being cheaper.
However, in the two years between
the end of the inquiry and publication
of the report, coal prices have risen
by a much smaller amount than was
A l t e r n a t i v e E n e r g y
predicted. As a result, a coal-fired
power station looks considerably
more attractive economically and may
well be cheaper than the PWR. In
addition, the accident at Chernobyl
has had a major effect on public
opinion, with a majority now being
opposed to any expansion in the
nuclear programme; the government
may do its best to convince the
electorate that nuclear power is safe,
but it ignores people's doubts at its
peril. Even if the government decides
to go ahead with the project, its
completion is far from certain since
the Labour Party is committed to
reversing this decision if it comes to
power.
Beyond economics
The problem of uncertainty is
present whatever one's priorities, but
a further difficulty presents itself
when we look further than the
economist's balance sheet—
conventional economics takes little or
no account of the effect of energy
supply and use on the environment.
It is easy to see why: how does one
put a price on pollution of the
atmosphere, possible hazards from
nuclear waste, visual impact, acid
rain, and all the other ways in which
energy conversion impinges on our
surroundings? Such social costs are
labelled 'externalities' by economists:
in other words, they are external to
the price system which governs the
allocation of resources, and therefore
cannot be incorporated easily into an
economic analysis. Several methods
of dealing with externalities have been
proposed but they are rarely used in
practice. The net effect is that the
costs attached to environmentally
damaging technologies do not reflect
their true social costs. If they did, the
more environmentally benign
'renewable' energy sources—wind,
hydro-power, sun, tides, waves—
would be seen in a much more
favourable light, as would energy
conservation measures. Indeed,
conservation is the most
environmentally sound as well as the
most practical approach, since we can
all help in the elimination of waste.
This is the background against
which the value of renewable energy
and conservation of energy should be
assessed. We will now go on to
consider some of the technologies
involved, indicating the progress that
has been made so far and what the
future may bring.
WIND POWER
The UK may be deficient in
sunlight, but it does not lack wind.
For this reason, wind power may well
be the most attractive of the renewable
energy technologies, a point which is
borne out by the number of wind
turbine generators that already exist.
This year, a 3 megawatt (MW) wind
turbine will be completed on the
Orkney Islands, where two smaller
turbines already exist. The CEGB is
planning to build a 1MW turbine at
a less windy site in Kent. A number
of smaller machines exist around the
country, particularly on remote and
windy island sites, and many more are
in use abroad, particularly in
Denmark and the USA.
The British Wind Energy
Association has calculated that, in
large numbers on good sites, wind
turbines could produce electricity at
around 2p/kWh (compared with
2.9p/kWh for Sizewell B). Most
existing wind turbines are of the
horizontal axis type, like traditional
windmills (though their appearance is
somewhat more high-tech!) but there
is a body of thought which believes
that a vertical axis would be more
appropriate since the machine does
not need to be rotated to face the wind
and because the generating equiment
can be located at the base of the
tower, thus reducing costs and
making maintenance easier. A 160kW
prototype has already been installed
at Carmarthen; this design is
ultimately intended to be used in a
full-scale offshore machine. This is
important, since there may be
objections to siting large numbers of
machines on exposed sites on land;
offshore, this problem does not exist,
although the cost is inevitably higher.
The size of the offshore wind resource
is immense: one estimate suggests that
even allowing for shipping lanes and
the like, offshore turbines could
produce an amount of electricity
equivalent to over half the UK's
current consumption. Since the
fluctuating output from wind turbines
restricts their potential contribution to
around 20% of our electricity needs,
the resource is clearly not a limiting
factor.
Much remains to be done to
establish suitable sites for wind
turbines, to improve their reliability
and reduce their unit costs. But there
is little doubt that large wind turbines
could play a major role in a future
electricity supply system, and with
little or no environmental damage.
WAVE POWER
Here are some of the facts on wave
power:
• The coastal waters of the UK have
average wave powers which are
among the highest in the world.
• A CEGB analysis has put the
feasible contribution of wave energy
to the national supply at around
10GW—about 'A of total demand.
• The fuel costs nothing and is
non-polluting.
• Dept. of Energy studies have
concluded that full scale devices
would produce "no major deleterious
environmental effects."
• Norway has 2 fully operational
wave power devices delivering
electricity to a local grid at an
estimated cost of 2.5p per Kwh.
However, in 1985 the UK
Government abandoned all research
on wave power. Ignoring Norway's
results, the estimated costs for wave
energy have fallen in the last ten years
from around 50p per kwh to below
lOp per kwh. This fact together with
savings from continued design
improvement would seem to suggest
that wave energy would soon be
economic. But despite spending over
ten years, less than a quarter of what
was spent on the Sizewell case alone,
all the UK has is a £2m report
rejecting wave power whilst the
Norwegians benefit from cheap
electricity from 2 machines costing
£lm.
SEVERN BARRAGE
Boon or burden? Although severely
criticised for how it may alter the
existing ecological balance in the
Severn Estuary, the Severn Barrage
may offer the most practical,
innovative and clean approach to
electricity generation this century.
Based on the concept of tidal power,
the Barrage would cross the Severn
Estuary between Cardiff and Weston-
Super- Mare, providing electricity by
the power of the tides driving turbines
in huge concrete cassions. Other
advantages include a new road
between Wales and England, creation
of huge employment, a permanent
watersports haven and absolutely no
pollution. The only disadvantage
would be that a few mud-nesting
species would bow to Darwinian
selection. In short, a fantastic
prospect for the CEGB and the British
windsurfer!
SOLAR
PHOTOELECTRICS
The photoelectric effect (the direct
conversion of light into electricity)
has been known since the middle of
the nineteenth century, but practical
solar cells weren't developed until the
1950's. when expensive solenium
cells were used on early US satellites.
Although the photoelectric effect
occurs in many materials, only a
small proportion of incident solar
energy is converted to electricity.
Most solar cells today are made from
silicon, having a conversion
efficiency of around 10%, which
means large arrays of cells are needed
for significant power generation—10
square feet is needed to power one
100-watt light bulb!
Despite this, solar cells offer
perhaps the greatest potential for
worldwide application of all the
renewable energy systems. Countries
still developing electricity supplies
could avoid all the paraphenalia of
large power stations, transmission
networks, transformers and the rest
by installing clusters of solar cells
supplying power to towns and villages
as and when needed.
The biggest 'catch' is cost: at
present solar energy is around ten
times as expensive as nuclear, but
such statistics can be misleading as
they preclude distribution costs and
environmental considerations. The
inevitability of sunlight necessitates
instantly available alternative
generators or adequate storage
capacity: either adds further to the
cost; as does the need for d.c. to a.c.
inversion. However, the problems are
not unsurmountable: intensive
research efforts to find new cell
materials and methods of production
are steadily bringing down costs, so
that photoelecticity is expected to
become competitive with
conventional power generation by the
turn of the century. In the UK solar
energy is competivie in only remote
low power applications at present,
such as navigation beacons, but even
here large scale generation should
become a serious option in 10 to 15
years time.
Once installed it is the simplest
power supply known. It is very
reliable, needs no maintenance or
chemical inputs, and may well outlive
us all (and today's nuclear power
plants!)
PASSIVE SOLAR HEATING
Solar power is a well known
alternative source of energy, be it for
small scale water heating or electricity
generation. Passive solar heating has,
up to now, remained the Cinderella
of solar circles, which is a pity as it
really works. Passive solar heating
will heat your room by harnessing the
sun's light as i> streams in through
your South facing window. To make
it more effective these windows
would be made larger and 'thermal
mass' within the room would store the
heat which is later given off during
darkness. Everyone enjoys a sunny
room, this method allows it to pay for
itself! As there are no moving parts
there is no maintenance, nor
pollution, nor any kind of waste
product. Costs are extremely low.
Passive solar heating can pay for itself
in a couple of years, even in our
climate, as a coherent package can
reduce fuel bills by 50%. Fuel savings
of this magnitude mean that if each
new home were built incorporating
passive solar heating our need for
power stations in the future would be
greatly reduced. How does 2 less
nuclear power stations sound? Passive
solar heating is so good the
government has financially backed its
development. All that is now needed
is for you architects and civil
engineers to make use of it.
CONCLUSION
It should be clear from the above
paragraphs that renewable energy
sources are not 'noddy' technologies.
They have been described as 'soft',
but this refers to their effect on the
environment rather than the nature of
the engineering involved. What can
be said with considerable justification
is that renewables are chronically
underftinded in the UK: in 1985—86,
the government spent over £ 170m on
nuclear power R & D , but only £15m
on renewables. Since much of this
money goes towards making the
technology economically attractive, it
can hardly be argued that renewables
are being considered on equal terms.
A vicious circle is in operation: the
less is spent on renewables relative to
nuclear power, the less attractive
economically they seem; and the less
attractive they seem, the less is spent
on them. One can only hope that a
combination of environmental and
economic enlightenment will enable
the circle to be broken and the country
set on the path of a sustainable, 'soft'
energy future.
ENVIRONMENTAL WEEK
Finally, the most important bit.
Next/this week (2nd—6th March) is
Imperial College Environmental
Week. This is your chance to learn
more, not just about renewable
energy (though there will be displays
around the College on this theme) but
also on the whole range of
environmental issues. The aim is to
increase your awareness of man's
impact on the planet and what can be
done to improve the situation—after
all, many students at Imperial will end
up in positions where their decisions
have a major bearing on the
environment.
