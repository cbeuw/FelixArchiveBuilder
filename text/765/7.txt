resistance and then to the fascists. As
he investigates, he uncovers the
elaborate plot of the fascists in which
a drug, Ephemerol, (standing for
Thalidomide?) is being clandestinely
manufactured and given to pregnant
women to produce scanner offspring.
It is only at the end of the film that
Vale discovers that the leader of the
fascists is his brother. Their father
was the pharmacologist who first
developed Ephemerol as a pain killer
for pregnant women, and tested the
drug on his own wife.
Cronenberg artfully exploits the
paranoia that is associated with
obscure, faceless security
organisations and pharmaceutical
research. It also touches on another
idea—invasion of the privacy of the
mind.
Videodrome is undoubtedly what
made Cronenberg notorious with the
press, public and censors alike.
Explicit imagery runs rampant, burnt
into the viewer's memory, unlikely to
be ever forgotten; but then, that's the
point of what Cronenberg always tries
to do. Videodrome is a TV channel
which seems to be broadcasting live,
non-stop torture, all set in a single
room. A TV station controller, Max
Renn (played by James Woods)
manages to pirate some of what
Videodrome has to offer, and eagerly
watches it. But he begins to suffer
hallucinations, and, on investigating,
dicovers that he was deliberately fed
Videodrome as an experiment. An
additional signal is sent out under the
normal TV signal, inducing brain
tumors in the viewer. The result is
hallucinations, the tone of which are
influenced by whatever the original
programme was.
Cronenberg is cautioning us that no
matter how we try to guard against
it, what we see on television is
increasingly becoming the source of
raw experience upon which we draw
in life. The film is his statement on
his concern with the way we
unthinkingly watch television,
accepting it into our lives without ever
considering its effect upon us.
After Videodrome and the swiftly
following censorship rows
Cronenberg went on to prove that he
can make a film without the gore and
splatter that his name has become
virtually synonomous with. The Dead
Zone, his highly acclaimed film
version of Stephen King's novel of the
same name, has the most sympathetic
character of any Cronenberg film
(along with The Fly). The leading
characters of Cronenberg's other
films are hardly heroes. At best, his
characters can be termed 'victims'—
but very seldom heroes. In The Dead
Zone we have Johnny Smith
(brilliantly played by Christopher
Walken). a young man who suffers
a car accident and emerges from his
coma some years later with the ability
to discern the past and future of an
object or person he happens to touch.
He discovers that the girl he loved
before the accident has married
someone else, but nevertheless
manages to settle down to a
reasonably happy life with his father.
He solves a murder mystery, saves a
boy's life by preventing him from
going skating on some thin ice at a
local lake and so on. But one day he
shakes hands with a junior politician,
and sees him in the future as the
President of the United States, insane,
starting World War III. Johnny Smith
cannot avoid his destiny, no matter
how he agonizes over whether or not
he is actually doing the world any
good.
Probably the most public aspect of
Cronenberg's career is his running
battle with the censors of various
nations. In England we have seen
such phenomena as legal actions
(admittedly unsuccessful) to prevent
the retail distribution of such films as
The Evil Dead. But we can look to
Canada to see what real censorship
implies. The Canadian public have
been unable to see the full,
unabridged version of Not a Love
Story. Vie Brood, featured in a
Toronto Film Festival, had the 'birth'
scene, crucial to the exposition of the
film, cut.
Videodrome. which won
Cronenberg the 'Best Direction'
award at the Genies (the Canadian
Oscars) has been cut both here in
Great Britain and in America. In
Britain, its video release was
indefinitely postponed, even though
it had already suffered three extensive
cuts.
Cronenberg's response to the issue
of censorship is one of deep
conviction. As a film maker, he can
only wish for his films to be seen—
no matter how censored they are.
Mary Brown, former head of the
Toronto Censor Board, is firmly set
against what she sees as 'the virulent
Cronenberg epidemic' According to
her research, people are more
concerned with what they would want
to stop their neighbour from being
able to see, rather than themselves.
In an interview Cronenberg
commented: "The virus is only trying
to live its life, just doing its job. In
fact I think most diseases would be
shocked to be considered diseases. It
has a very negative connotation, For
them, it's very positive when they
take over your body and destroy you.
It's a triumph."
Whilst Cronenberg may be on
sound ground when he advocates the
right of the individual to see
something for him or herself, he does
seem to skate across thin ice when he
says; "As an artist one is not a citizen
of society, One is bound to explore
every corner of human experience.
You can't worry about what your
society regards as good or bad
behaviour. The artist has no sense of
social responsibility whatsoever."
Several questions spring to mind from
this speech; if an artist is not a
member of society then how is he
qualified to comment on that society,
If the artist has no sense of social
responsibility, does this mean that
Cronenberg would go on TV
participating in a programme like
Videodrome? If he thought it was
artistic would he torture people on
live TV? Just how far is he prepared
to go? Cronenberg's films all deal
with the thesis that man has arrested
his own natural evolution, and will
soon begin to control it himself, that
the body will evolve on its own,
leaving the mind behind.
He has been described as the
opposite of Steven Spielberg. Films
such as the Star Wars series, the
Rocky series, ET, all tell us that we
shouldn't change modern society—it
is fine as it is. We will win out in the
end. Cronenberg says that we
shouldn't change society because if
we tried we would only make it
worse.
Perhaps what Cronenberg really
strives for in his films is best summed
up by his own words.
"We have created our own
Universe. And therefore what's
wrong with it also comes from within
us. We carry around the seeds of our
own destruction withing us. For me
the imagery of The Creaturefrom the
Black Lagoon was always perfect
because the Black Lagoon is the dark
pool of the unconcious and of course
there are creatures within it. The
exercise is to jump down into the
Lagoon to see what is going on down
there and to say 'hello' to the
creature."
