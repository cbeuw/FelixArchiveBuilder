Castaway Cup 1987
Apostolous
rides again
On the das of Saturday 21 st February,
it came to pass that the intrepid sailors
didn't once again meet and compete
in the annual varsity competition
'gainst London colleges for the
hallowed Castaways Cup.
'Twas to be a tough competition
that day with QMC. UC. Bans and
London Hospital among the
contenders. The wind was reported to
be a strong force 6. gusting gale force
8. so 3 rolls in the main were the
order of the day to avoid capsizes.
After de-icing rigging and tuning the
boats, the day began.
IC 1 against UC were in the first
race. However, it was left to Richard
and Sam. Ape and Helen to battle it
out while the other boat re-captured
its jib again just in time to get out and
help finish with a 1-2-4 combination
(which means for the lesser yellow
wellies among you that we came 1st.
2nd and 4th out of 6 boats!)
The second race IC I sailed was
also skilfully won. 1-2-6. despite once
of the boats missing the start because
it was full of water and missing a
rudder.
The third race IC I sailed was
against IC II and this was won with
a 1-2-3 finish and, miraculously no
gear failure!
As to who won the race against
QMC just before lunch was much
debated and although IC I skilfully
gained 2nd. 3rd and 4th positions
thereby winning on the water, the
outcome was never fully decided.
After lunch the course changed for
the 3rd time leading to great
confusion all round but we sailed on
to qualify for the finals.
Under full mainsail, as the wind
had dropped to a blustery force 5 by
this time, it was to be IC I against
QMC in the finals, the team with least
points after 2 races would take home
the trophy.
IC skilfully manoeuvred a good
start although Ape collected 2 greens
in the process (% point each) Richard
gave out a green at the next mark and
took one later on in the race. Dave
gave out two greens to the opposition
and we finished in the lead by % of
a point.
We swapped boats with our
opponents for the final race and
fought it out to the bitter end. We
might have won the trophy is it hadn't
been for one of the team getting tired
of playing cat-and-mouse on the start
line and going for a swim in the icy
water instead. But then?...
1st Team: R Brimelow, S Page,

Small fry
After an early start on Saturday the
IC 2nd sailing team gathered at the
Welsh Harp for their major test of the
year. How to beai sailors from all the
other colleges in London University
as well as our own first team? The
event was organised with two round-
robin series from which the best two
teams would be selected to contest the
final. This meant we had a lot of
racing to do in one day. After a
slightly shaky start against QMC (the
eventual winners); where only
Richard Jarman was able to offer any
form of attack due to a near capsize
by Charles Oxley; the team steadily
improved until their last match of the
1st series against our own 1st team.
By using aggressive starting tactics
the 2nds were able to take two
penalties from the lsts but lacked the
boat speed to be able to keep up and
finished 4.5.6.
Having finished the first series
without winning a race but coming
very close in all the second series
promised to be more rewarding.
Again the team were out manoeuvred
by QMC. Against UC we showed
more spirit. Charles Oxley getting in
amongst the UC boats and causing
them some problems as well as having
his own working out what the course
was whilst leading the race. St.
Bartholomew proved to be easy meat,
having sailed one lap of the race there
was time for one boat to make a slight
pitstop thus confusing the opposition
enough to allow Adam Storke to sail
through to the front. With some useful
team racing IC won easily.
Our last race of the day against IC
lsts was another grudge match. The
2nds battled hard and made the 1st
work very hard for their win. This left
QMC and IC lsts to contest the final
with the 2nds finishing 5th overall.
Throughout the day the second team
showed signs of what they are capable
of and what IC Ists will be like in the
future.
2nd Team: C Oxley, A Stork, M
Hunter, D Lucas-Clements, D
Hobbs, R Jarman.

On a day on which IC were decidedly
off colour (partially accounted for by
the activities of several players the
previous night), they did very well to
win an exciting, if slightly scrappy
game by the odd goal.
Everything started according to
plan with IC easily dominating the
early stages. However, it needed an
error from the UCL goalie for IC to
open their account—Hari Vamadevan
beating the UCL defenders to the
loose ball and calmly slotting it into
the open goal. IC continued to create
excellent goal scoring opportunities,
notably Justin Brooking scooping the
ball over the cross-bar from 4 yards.
It was half way through the first half
when IC began to lose their way and
the defence looked increasingly
vulnerable to the hard running UCL
centre forward. On just such a run by
him a sloppy stick tackle by an IC
defender in the 'D' (penalty area)
resulted in UCL being awarded a
penalty flick which was converted to
bring them level. With IC still reeling
from this blow a UCL forward siezed
upon a loose ball in the 'D', which
IC had had ample opportunity to
clear, to slip the ball past a hesitant
Phil Choudhury in goal to make the
score 1-2 at the interval.
After an aggressive team talk from
captain Jon Stonham IC came out into
the 2nd with all cylinders firing. After
much concerted pressure the
inevitable happened and IC equalised,
Hari Vamadevan neatly deflecting, on
his reverse stick, a cross from the
right past a surprised and rather slow
UCL goalie. With IC now pushing all
out for the winner, it left Phil
Choudhury exposed at the back one
occasion, but he responded well to
make a quick interception with 2 UCL
forwards bearing down on him. Just
as it seemed a win would evade the
grasp of IC, with numerous chances
going begging, Jeremy Barsington
bravely launched himself at a shot
going inches wide of the post and
superbly turned it inside the goal to
give IC their much deserved winner.
