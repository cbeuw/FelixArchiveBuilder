Felix FELIX, Friday February 20th 1987 5
W a l t e r ' s bit
Waller is pleased to observe that the
construction of the new Department
of Computing premier is proceeding
apace. Not being a civil engineer he
cannot comment on the design but to
the tyro it does appear to be a case
of rather large girders held together
with rather small bolts. He can
envisage the future case, in the event
that someone has miscalculated, of the
Department of Computing operating
in one storey, two foot high, wall to
wall steel pancake, although this
would probably be preferable to their
current accommodation.
Although next year's sabbaticals
are immune to the power of the
pen—for the moment—this year's are
still providing their customary fun.
Specifically, Mr. D.I. Colley, whose
legendary hunger led him at one point
to eat an election paper. The place has
been alive with nasty rumours, and
Walter being the gentleman he is, has
recorded every one, hoping to distill
fact from fiction. Alas, it is
impossible! Which only goes to prove
that one shouldn't listen to rumours,
even if they are started by the current
Honorary Secretary.
Walter is desolate, yes dammit
desolate, to observe this week that the
actions in certain unmentionables in
standing for sabbatical posts has
robbed him of his main source of
entertainment, as sabbatical
candidates are ipso facto hands off to
the press. However, some events at
the Union General Meeting seem to
merit a word or three.
Walter was delighted to observe, in
this plastic world, that some good soul
proposed the abandonment of plastic
knives, forks and glasses in the Union
bars. He was rather less delighted to
see the motion summarily thrown out.
On the subject of the Union bars,
congratulations to the RSM for
winning the football and the hockey,
if not the rugby, at their bottle match
against Cambourne last Saturday. No
congratulations at all for inviting them
back to the bars for a few drinks,
although one result of this was to
promote the fastest 20 yard dash yet.
recorded by Mr. Northey. On seeing
a fire hose turned on his beloved pizza
shack, he moved with a most
remarkable speed for one of sedentary
habits, sweeping down the shutters
and closing the bar with a most
dramatic flourish.
Mr. Northey's gain was the loss of
the Union Bar, which suffered an
incursion of Cornish genetic mutoids
intent on mayhem. Not so were the
security staff, who acted on the latest
master plan of Mr. Reeves: Do
nothing...with the result that Mr.
Colley started another ulcer, and
Council on Monday heard a
suggestion from Hurrican Christine
that Cambournians should be banned.
This, of course, came to nowt.
Walter apologises for this weeks
lack of material, but informs his
readers that things should warm up
as soon as the elections are over. And
you never know, we may yet hear
from Southside shop, who have not
yet responded to last weeks icy
Walterian blast. Nor have they
lowered their prices...
One final thing: Walter suggests
that Mr. Royle should make contact
with someone about his taste for
flagellation. This someone must
remain unnamed for the nonce, but
in a few weeks...publish and be
damned!
Earlier this week, Walter listened
with interest to the sound of Mr
Richard G. Fincher on IC Radio. He
congratulates Mr. Fincher for such a
remarkable performance in one so
young, but he feels obliged to observe
that if the young gentleman devoted
himself more to his school curriculum
and less to broadcasting, he would
find himself better prepared when he
is old enough to come to Imperial
College as a student.
Finally, Walter would like to
apologise to readers for his absence
from these pages last week—gossip
was short and column space was
shorter: Et tu. Editor?
News, glorious News,
B a c k s t r o k e
Computer shops have always suffered
from people typing swear words into
their display models and have them
printed in large letters on the screen.
Infuriated at having "Johnny is a
w***ker" splattered in green all
across the screen, they have decided
to retaliate against this menace with
a battery of countermeasures.
Each micro now comes complete
with a 'swear-filter' which roots out
any offending words and replaces
them with more socially acceptable
phrases such as "not very nice" or
"Mary Whitehouse." As an
additional deterrent a speech
synthesizer can be hooked up which
generates embarassing messages such
as "This person is a pervert."
Given the popularity of foreign
films like Diva and Betty Blue
amongst young aesthetes these days,
an alternative theatre group operating
from Islington has decided to stage a
production of Candide in the original
French with subtitles. Actors deliver
their lines in French while extras enter
carrying placards with the English
translation.
James Houston of the group
explains: "The play sounds much
better in Voltario's original version,
however, we want to bring the play
to a w ider audience, and the only way
we can do it is with subtitles."
Last Tuesday, the first issue of Robert
Maxwell's new London newspaper
came out. The long-awaited London
Daily News is printed round the clock
at a rate of five editions a day. It is
aimed at a sector of the market which
is occupied safely by The London
Evening Standard. The Standard
which is owned by Associated
Newspapers, whose chairman is Lord
Rothermere, swallowed its only
previous competion, the Evening
News seven years ago and has been
the only London Daily ever since.
In comparison with the Standard,
I think it stands up very well. The first
issue was noticeably thicker with
sixty-four pages, but this may not
outlast the extra effort involved with
the launch edition. It is, in my view,
a lot easier to find one's way about
the News than the Standard,
moreover, the headings are a lot
bolder making it easier to pick up the
snippets of news that are of particular
interest.
As far as content goes, there is little
to choose between them. They both
opt for a similar mix of news and
gossip and they both give a sound
basis for Labour's claims of a 'Tory'
press, with uncomplimentary reports
on the 'loony left' councils, but the
Standard excels itself with a long
article by Norman Tebbit while the
News redresses the balance somewhat
with an article on the Greenwich by-
election sympathetic to Deirdre
Wood, the Labour candidate.
Predictably on the issue of their
own rivalry the News is loud and the
Standard is silent. The News has a
front page article on its own launch,
an editorial claiming the Standard is
'running scared' and a long article on
what it sets out to do. The only clue
in the Standard that the News exists
at all is an article describing the
relaunch of the Evening News—Lord
Rothermere's answer to the London
Daily News—which doesn't even
mention Robert Maxwell's new
paper.
In the very important
entertainments section, the News
again comes off better. Its headings
are a lot clearer, making it easier to
find what you want and the cinema
section contains a brief sentence on
each film as well as the times, place
and age rating. All the entertainment
in the news comes out in a handy pull-
out section. The theatre coverage in
the Standard is, however, more
extensive.
In spite of my rather low opinion
of Robert Maxwell, I would
recommend his paper above the
Standard, at least for the moment. It
is remarkably free from his odious
values. If the population of London
agree with me, the Standard will
undoubtedly improve, to the benefit
of all.
