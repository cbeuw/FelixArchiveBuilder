Elections
So, once more to the ballot boxes we
go...It seems a bit of a shame that
there are only a few candidates for the
sabbatical posts this year—there's
nothing like a good nail-biting
election. I hope there'll still be a huge
turnout at the Hustings U G M on
Thursday: for those who haven't been
to one before, this is your chance to
have a good look at the candidates.
Hear them telling you how much
better than this year's lot they'll be.
Laugh at their haircuts. Find out how
much or how little they know about
what they're taking on, or whatever.
However involved in the Union you
consider yourself to be you shouldn't
miss this one—these people could end
up speaking for you, spending your
money, supposedly representing you.
None of the sabbatical posts are easy
jobs; no-one should walk straight into
them.
I wonder if other student Unions
have so few sabbatical candidates? Is
it perhaps that the job prospects for
IC students are particularly good,
making a lot of potentially suitable
candidates eager to go out into the big
wide world and earn lots of money?
It all gives me a slightly uneasy
feeling. Were we fools to take on the
posts in the beginning or are we just
a hard act to follow?...
Environmental Week
Speaking of the big wide world... it's
no secret that there won't be much of
it left his time next century if
humankind continues along its present
course. I've never understood why
people who speak out against the
devestating depletion of the earth's
resources, and the horrific pollution
of the air, soil and water we depend
on, are.so often dismissed as wooly-
headed cranks. (Mind you, as
Schumaker said, what's wrong with
being a crank?—It's a small,
inexpensive tool that makes
revolutions...)
A concern for the environment we
live in doesn't just mean saving the
small cute furry animals—it means
long-term survival for all of us. It is
also something which cuts across
traditional political barriers—as next
week should show.
I'd like to wish the organisers of
Environmental Week the best of luck;
and I hope loads of people will take
part. The least we can do as scientists
and engineers is think about the
impact of our work upon the future
of the planet.
Secret Society
There is a strangely secretive
atmosphere to this College
sometimes. For instance—whilst the
Students' Union is asked to produce
quite detailed recommendations on
the merger with St. Mary's, the
campus Trades Unions hear almost
nothing—except rumours from their
St. Mary's counterparts, who, it
seems, are far better informed. They
are left to worry about the effects of
a merger upon their jobs and
conditions. For instance again, the
students at Silwood are unaware that
their facilities are to be rented out to
companies using the new 'Science
Park' at Silwood, until somebody puts
up on the noticeboard a copy of an
agreement to that effect.
I wouldn't necessarily say that there
is anything malicious about this
secrecy; it just seems that it doesn't
occur to anybody in the College
administration to keep interested
parties informed. This, despite
constant assurances that we are all
part of the 'College Community?'
This lack of information and
communication is doing a great deal
to damage any sense of community
that the College has. Life would be
a lot easier and more relaxed for
everyone at College if those in
possession of information didn't wait
for aggrieved students and staff to
come knocking on their doors before
being prepared to distribute it.
Christine
Don't talk to me
about life!
I can think of few things to commend
this universe to prospective entrants.
To all unborn souls I say don't bother
to get born here, it really isn't worth
it.
The worst things about this
time/place are the physical laws. To
start with, there's a thing called the
Theory of Relativity, which says that
you can't travel faster than this
incredibly dilatory thing called light.

Great for prospective hermits and
compulsive prisoners...As if this
weren't enough, there are the three
laws of thermodynamics which say,
respectively: "You can't win," "You
can't break even" and "You can't
play the game." The corollary of this
is that, in the fullness of time, the
universe will consist entirely of
lukewarm lumps of iron.
Anyway, if you have to choose this
universe don't have anything to do
with a planet called earth. It has very
few things seriously right with it. It
is an evil twist of fate, that on this
benighted planet those nations that
have best solved their physical
problems make a virtue out of being
unhappy. Happiness and enjoyment
are crimes for which one must feel
very guilty.
One of the greatest pleasures of any
finite existence is communication with
like minded beings, or friends.
Indeed, of all the many millions with
whom you could make friends, you
are liable to meet just a handful. Very
often you get into the exceptionally
perverse situation of people knowing
you well enough not to want to know
you well. But in this madhouse, it
does not do to pretend that one
anything less than ecstatically happy.
To check up on this, everyone asks
everyone else how they are, at regular
intervals.
The obvious solution to this
problem is for everyone to return to
oblivion; but his won't do either. The
most popular religion on the planet
teaches that individuals returning
themselves to oblivion, will end up,
not in oblivion, but in excruciating
torture for all eternity. And if you try
to return to oblivion, people will go
to extraordinary lengths to prevent
you. They will even do it by physical
force! Whoever started project Earth
used the highly unscrupulous
technique of incorporating love of
life, or more accurately, fear of
oblivion (the so-called 'death') into
the physical framework of
inhabitants. This ensured the
continued existence of the project.
This devious trick has affected even
such enlightened and dispassionate
observers as myself. I am too
frightened to return to oblivion of my
own accord and so will not, barring
an accident, be returning for the time
being.
Needless to say this article is highly
sacreligious and would be either
roundly condemned or passed for
meaningless rubbish were it ever
published on earth. So for those of
you unfortunate enough to get born
in this awful place, the only pleasure
I have been able to isolate, without
unpleasant after or side-effects; is
getting into a hot bath with cold feet.
