Letters FELIX, Friday February 27th 1987 2
On with the
pointless
grind
Dear Dave,
On the subject of UGM attendance,
may I note the following:
i) Poor attendance is intimately
connected with the general climate of
apathy that reigns in IC.
ii) People tend to be more apathetic
in the subjects that require their
contribution towards a goal that
serves the 'common good.'
iii) These subjects may be related
to Union or other student activities,
decisions on political matters and
especially humanitarian work (eg
Amnesty, Third World.)
The whole structure of studies is
such that after three years far too
many people feel sick and tired of
their courses. As a third year I find
myself under enormous work
pressure. I think that for most of us
there's no question of trying to get a
good degree and spending time for
other activities as well. We all knew
from the beginning that IC would
mean hard work, but we're not
merely faced with hard work here,
we're faced with over-crowded
courses where trying to learn masses
of information destroys the beauty of
scientific thinking.
This results in something else as
well>along with specific reasons such
as those mentioned in Christine Taig's
bit last week, poor attendance at
UGM's and general apathy may be
attributed to the fact that students of
Imperial do not feel part of it. There
is virtually no such thing as an IC
community; we don't have the time
(in the long run) to identify with IC
or the Union; we don't belong to
them.
As long as the course structure
remains as it is, having as an aim to
produce people for industry in the
least possible time (ie with the least
possible expenditure), both our
interest in our courses and Union etc.
activities will be in great danger, to
say the least. It seems, therefore, that
the work of the people in the
Union—which is very important
indeed—will go on finding no
response or acknowledgement.
The few enthusiasts will have to
work bloody hard for seemingly
insignificant changes, for students that
don't give a damn but who do need
those enthusiasts. Abolishing UGMs
and the like does not solve any of the
problems. So the (serious) suggestion
is that you have to go on no matter
how pointless the task seems
sometimes.
Yours sincerely,
Michael Moutoussis, Physics III.
Smug and
self-righteous
Dear Dave,
Sorry to hog the letters page again,
but I'd like to set Rob Brown straight
on a few points he raised in his letter
of last week, under the heading of 'In
God he trusts.'
I do not wish to stamp my ethics
on society, and it is not true to say
that I have no time to listen to anyone
else. Most of all. I am not merely
insisting that my way is right, full
stop. My ethics, as he terms them, are
my own; not everyone would wish to
follow them, and why should they?
All I want people to concede is that
my way is rightfor me, and for people
like me. and that this doesn't need to
affect anyone else. Is that so difficult?
Apparently, at Imperial College it is:
to moderate this attitude must be the
most compelling raison d'etre of the
gay and lesbian officer.
I would also like to say that I, and
I am sure many others, found Mr
Brown's quote from New Society
smug and self-righteous in the
extreme. There are lots of reasons
why London's down-and-outs are
what they are, and not all of these
involve being "smelly, noisy,
nauseous, drunk and drugged."
People may be reduced to living
rough in London by sheer misfortune,
of a kind which might break the writer
of that offensive article.
You stick to your God and your
New Society, Mr Brown, and I'll
stick to my 'ethics.'
Yours sincerely,
Andrew Bannister, Geology I.
"Arbitrary
rules"
Dear FELIX,
I am not surprised that people are
casually dismissive of God with
people like Rob Brown (Letters,
FELIX 764) as his self-appointed
messenger. People like him seem to
want to reduce God to a series of rules
mainly about what not to do with
one's genitals. If that is not the case,
why did he mention gays at all, as I
fail to see otherwise the connection
of his opening paragraph with the rest
of his letter.
The Christ one reads of in the
gospels has little time for those whose
religion is merely preaching arbitary
rules, or picking out bits of scripture
to reinforce their own prejudices. His
message is one of social justice: how
one wishes some of the self-righteous
'evangelical' Christians who abound
at IC turned their attention to this
major theme and left off their
obsession with sex.
Yours sincerely,
Matthew Huntbach, Dept. of
Computing.
Of terrorists
and the ANC
Dear Sir,
With reference to Y Mponella's
letter (FELIX 764) I believe it is
unfair to imply ignorance purely on
the grounds of holding an unpopular
or differing-opinion. Furthermore,
he/she then expects to educate these
so called ignorant people with a
simplistic view of the situation which
favours the ANC. I am writing to
introduce a little reality into the
argument.
Firstly, I accept the presence of
refugees in neighbouring countries,
unfortunately the ANC chooses to
hide behind the civilians knowingly
endangering the people they claim to
represent. The governments of these
countries are aware of the presence
of these terrorists but do nothing
substantial to remove them.
Secondly Y Mponella seems
confident of the future. "I hope the
ANC....when it comes to power."
This seems to indicate a slide towards
totalitarianism as, for instance, the
Zulus appear to be forgotten. Could
it be because the majority of Zulus
accept peaceful change and reform?
Indeed perhaps most of the population
favour reform, currently more black
people are joining the police force
than ever. There is no right way to
end apartheid, just a best way by
which the least people are hurt.
Thirdly, comparison with the
Second World War is ridiculous. The
ANC are not waging war, if they
were they would not be burning
civilians and leaving land mines for
innocent people to stumble across.
They do not consistently attack the
armed forces, who expect the
possibility of being killed, but instead
intimidate the defenceless. This is my
objection to the terrorism of the ANC
and terrorism everywhere, so
hopefully this also answers Andrew
Partington's letter also in FELIX 764.
I would like to point out that the
issue is being clouded by specific
reference to South Africa, my first
letter was an attempt to disregard the
morality of apartheid and concentrate
on the fight against terrorism. At least
Andrew Partington understood this
and wrote a relevant letter. As I have
already said I do not have a low, but
on the contrary a high, regard for
human life, otherwise I would not
want to see it protected from
terrorists.
Almost everyone can envisage a
situation in which they would kill,
merely because some of us admit it
more readily, does not make us
extremists. Death is a good deterrent
unless facing a Jihad, which the
majority of terrorism isn't, as terroists
are generally out to further their own
selfish ends and getting killed usually
isn't one of them. This power lust is
exactly the reason, for example, that
if our forces withdrew from Northern
Ireland the terrorist factions would not
form a coalition or whatever else
Andrew Partington expects them to
do.
lastly, I would like to apologise for
assuming Ms Adenubi was a man. As
you might have guessed I am far from
brilliant with names; the odds were
four to one in my favour and still I
got it wrong.
Yours sincerely,
Mike Allen, Physics I.
