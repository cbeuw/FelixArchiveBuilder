Saturday 21st Feb.
Burway Head
Classic
engineering
Last Saturday oarsmen from IC Boat
club again snowed their domination
of rowing in the Home Counties.
While the first eight trained at Putney,
the rest of the club raced at Burway
Head. Of the six categories that they
contested the club notched up five
victories and one near miss.
Sixty crews competed in the
morning's fours racing. Imperial won
three divisions. These included the
overall winners, the Senior B winner
(second overall) and, most
spectacularly, the novice winners.
The most pleasing result was the
win for our novice coxed four. These
oarsmen began rowing at Imperial on
October 1st and have already reached
a higher standard than oarsmen from
other clubs who have been rowing for
years. The novices raced in an old,
well worn boat, and are used to
equipment failure: last week they lost
to Brunei University when a seat
broke. Victory again seemed to have
slipped from their hands when the
rudder fell off. The resourceful cox,
however, was able to steer by dipping
his hand into the freezing water. They
completed the race and were delighted
to beat Brunei and win the novice
division, coming 13th overall.
The eights, racing again with a field
of sixty crews, gained wins for IC at
Senior A and Senior C levels. The
Senior A eight (Imperial second
eight), who had raced earlier in fours,
included Chas 'no-nickname'
Behrens, who had trained in the early
morning with the first eight. They
won their division easily, but were
unlucky not to win overall, finishing
a close second to Walton Rowing
Club.
The Senior C crew finished 9th
overall and are beginning to gather a
ferocious reputation among the other
clubs. Perhaps this is because of their
cox, who recently overdosed on ugly
pills.

IC 2, Spartans 7
Doubles stay
down
IC, having lost 2 vital matches in the
race for promotion, came up against
Spartans, the promotion favourites,
for the second and last time this
season. It was a match IC had to win.
The match started well with first
blood going to IC's first pair, Simon
Hughes and Sean Mulshaw. They had
a close first game but easily overcame
Spartans second pair in the second
game. Our seconds then had a tough
start against the opposition's first pair.
It was a hard fought match but Gary
Chapman and Graham Scott, having
repeatedly got themselves into
winning positions, just could not put
the shuttle away. It was the same story
when the 2 Richards, Etheridge and
Langford, took on the thirds (2
members of the older (illegible-
typesetter), one of whom had a lot of
hair and shouted a lot!!)
The second round of matches
started badly when Simon and Sean
were beaten by the narrowest of
margins by the Spartans first pair. It
really could not have been closer, the
score being 18-17, 15-18 and 18-17
against IC. It was a shame because
exactly the same result happened
when these two pairs met earlier in
the season. That made the score 3-1
to Spartans and although Gary and
Graham had two close rubbers with
the opposition it was not going to be
our night. The score progressed to 5-1
before IC won another rubber but the
final score was 7-2, a result that will
surely keep us firmly in the 3rd
division.
Quote of the night by Richard
Langford—when queried by one of
the opposition during play as to
whether he had broken a string, he
replied, "No, it's alright it's only
one!"
Results since then:
Kensington Inst 4, IC 5
Whitton 0, IC 9
Orienteers fail to start
Due to slight (?) problems with
transport on Sunday we didn't make
it to the proposed event. Fortunately
we got 'a lot of exercise on
Saturday—by showing everybody
where to go! (That is where the
orienteering comes in.) The cross-
country club had invited us to enter
and marshal Saturday's Hyde Park
Relays.
Results: The men's team ran their,
6x3 mile relay in 107 minutes placing
them respectably in the latter half ot
the field. The women's team, plagued
by injury, managed lo come
somewhere above lasl. running the
4x2 mile in a total of 70 minutes.
Finally thanks to all additional
orienteers who turned up lor three
cold, but entertaining, hours of
marshalling duty.
Football
Wednesday 18th Feb.
IC It's 4, SOP 0
Blizzards and
turkeys
On reaching that remote part of
England known as Turkey Street, the
IC lads refreshed their parts with half
a pint of local ale and were then ready
for an afternoon's business.
From the kick-off these spirited IC
athletes took control of the game,
however the Siberian blizzards were
enough to put off the team's decisive
touch in front of goal. Hence at half-
time the scoreline remained blank. In
the second half Thompson, aided by
the slim figure of N MacDonald,
tenaciously took control in the centre
of the park once more. The lads
having now become accustomed to
Keel in's geordie accent, recognised
his calls for the ball and duly set him
on his way. creating havoc down the
right. Indeed it was a fine ball from
Laverick. putting Keelin through,
whose floated cross was met by IC's
injured skipper M Barro. which
started the scoring for IC. Minutes
later Barrow picked up the ball in
midfield. ran tantalisingly at the
defense, slipped a precise pass
through tor Hardy who slotted it into
the net with his left foot.
From then on IC made things look
easy. Wilson and Holland looked
comfortably elegant in the centre of
defense. Laverick and Dunthorne
made great use of the flanks, and J
Wrcford the keeper wondered if he
was going to be required to do
something worthy of a mention in the
College newspaper.
Semeria's persistent shooting led to
IC's third goal, when his shot was
deflected leaving Russ Hardy to
arrogantly put away his second of the
match. Goal number four came when
Barrow passed to Keeling who then
skinned' his defender with all the
grace of an ex-Sunderland school boy
and shot home emphatically-
champion y' know.
Team: J Wrcford. S Ltiverick.
S Dunthornc, J. Holland.
J Wilson. N MacDonald.
P Thomson. A Keelin. D. Semeria,
R Hatch, M Barrow.

Last week's
clubs article
The last few weeks have seen two
competitions in the dance club
calendar. On Saturday January 28th
there was the National Student Rock
'n' Roll Competition incorporated
into an authentic 'swing' evening at
Manning Hall, ULU Imperial entered
three couples each couple having only
1 or 2 terms dancing to their credit.
All of the couples danced well but
special congratulations must go to
Simon Deiyer and Dawn Fletcher on
coming 5th and to Neil McCluskey
and Dinah Woodhurst on becoming
the British champions. Credit must of
course go to our rock 'n' roll teacher
Vicky Cunniffe for her hard work and
dedication.
On Sunday February 8th five
couples went to Cardiff to compete in
a six-university ballroom and latin
team competition. Despite some
appalling judging we managed to pick
up two 2nd places, one in the jive, the
other in cha-cha, to give the team 3rd
place overall. Thanks go to Dave
Caballero for stepping in at the last
minute. Special mention must go to
Gill Knowles and Mike Carpenter
who were unable to dance owing to
injuries sustained by Mike in an
accident. Both were extremely upset
by not being able to compete, but
thank you both for your keen support.
Thanks again go to Vicky for
coaching the team.
For details of competitions coming
up soon, to which we'll be running
coaches, and for details of classes
please see the dance club noticeboard
on the walkway outside the JCR.
