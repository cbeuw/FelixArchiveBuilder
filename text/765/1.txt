The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949
Hyde Park revisited
Only six IC students took part in yesterday's march protesting
against the proposed 50% ULU cuts. About 250 in all marched
from ULU in Malet Street to the offices of the University Grants
Commission (UGC).
The march began at midday
yesterday, when the protestors were
addressed by representatives of ULU,
the Association of University
Teachers (AUT) and NUS National
President Vicky Phillips. They then
set off stopping traffic on Tottenham
Court Road and Euston Road on the
way.
Once at the UGC. ULU President
Jane Cannon personally presented a
petition of 12.500 signatures
protesting about the cuts, while the
demonstrators chanted outside in the
rain.
Representing Imperial was IC
Union Hon Sec Dave Collev. who
commented afterwards that "they
didn't know any good songs."
NUS inaction
The National Union of Students held
a demonstration on Saturday against
falling student grants, student loans
and the Tory government's education
policy. The demonstration, which
was held in Hyde Park, attracted
between twenty and twenty five
thousand students from colleges
around the country. NUS president
Vicky Phillips told FELIX that this
was the first stage of a long battle. She
added "6.2 million students, who the
government have upset and ignored,
will be voting for the first time. For
every one person on the demostration
hundreds could not afford to attend,
but if the government dare to
introduce student loans then we will
all fight together."
ICU president Christine Taig, when
asked about the demonstration said
she thought the NUS was naive. She
was too busy to go on the
demonstration, but when asked said
she was not impressed with Vicky
Phillips' comments on radio and
television. She advised all students
concerned about grants and loans to
vote for the Labour candidates in the
forthcoming general election.
Mr Politician
Beam me up Scottie
"It's democracy they're afraid of"
according to Mr Tony Benn MP. who
spoke to a packed Great Hall on
Monday. Mr Benn addressed nearly
400 students, at a meeting organised
by IC Socialist Society.
The theme of Mr Benn's talk was
was that Capitalism has its power base
in the Press and financial institutions.
He said that the media divided society
by setting up groups against each
other, citing those in work and the
unemployed, black and white, and
Catholic and Protestant as examples.
"We need", he said, "something as
strong as Capitalism" in order to
rebuild anything worth living for in
Britain. Just as Capitalism has power
outside Parliament, he added, the
power of Socialism must be outside
the Labour party. The Labour party's
problems, he continued, had been
caused by forgetting that democracy
"is not what someone else does on
our behalf".
Much of the questioning directed at
Mr Benn was devoted to the subject
of defence. Emphasising that his
views were disimilar to Labour Party
policy, he continued that he envisaged
a non-nuclear Britain, and a
consequent withdrawal from NATO,
brought about by US pressure.
Britain's ultimate fate, he believed,
was to become a leading light
amongst the non-aligned states.
Mr Benn went on to say that the
United States was now an imperialist
state, mirroring the British Empire he
had grown up in. Its attempts at
destabilising the Soviet Union through
arms supplies to Islamic
fundamentalists in Iran and
Afghanistan were, he said,
"extremely dangerous".
When it was pointed out that a
Soviet invasion had sparked off the
war in Afghanistan, he retorted that
Britain had invaded Afghanistan at
least four times last century.

Weeks
give way
The Weeks Hall rent strike has been
averted. A resident's meeting on
Wednesday was told by Student
Accommodation Officer Lesley
Gillingham that all the residents
demands had been acceded to.
The meeting was told that all
residents would be given an Â£8 rebate
for the two weeks the hall was without
heat and water, and that the repairs
which had been demanded would be
carried out immediately. The heating
system will be renovated over the
summer, five years overdue, and the
kitchens would be upgraded, the
details depending on demand for
rooms next year.
Dave Colley. ICU Hon Sec. said
that a Union holding account was
ready in case of a rent strike as had
been the case in 1974. A vote decided
to cancel the rent strike, 39 to 0 with
two abstentions.
