Acid escape
in Mines
At 12 noon on Monday this week, the
ground floor of the old RSM building
was visited by all three emergency
services. Two fire engines with a
mobile fire control unit were followed
round to the rear of the RSM by two
ambulances and a police van. The
services were called when an
autoclave in the building exploded,
causing a quantity of hydrochloric
acid to be released. Two firemen
dressed in protective clothing and
masks to ward off fumes entered the
building, only to be told by RSM staff
that the situation was under control,
and that no further help was required.
A spokesman told FELIX that the
spillage had not been particularly
serious, and that it had not been
thought necessary to sound alarms in
the building.
Cardiff
crisis
The financial crisis at University
College Cardiff (UCC) has been
deepening for the past few years. The
college is about £5 million in debt at
the moment, a figure which, a Price
Waterhouse report says, could rise to
£8.5—£11 million by the end of the
decade. This situation has arisen
partly because of the recent UGC
policy which allocates money more
on the basis of student numbers than
the size and quality of research
programs. Provincial universities,
which are spread out and so have
more duplication than city
universities, do particularly badly
under the new system and UCC has
been hit hard.
Unfortunately, the Government
underfunding has been exacerbated by
the principal, Dr. Cecil Bevan, whose
management has been criticised. The
UCC branch of the AUT, non-
professional staff and the College
Senate have all passed votes of no
confidence in Dr. Bevan who is due
to retire next year.
Since the Price Waterhouse report
UCC has been asked to present
financial and academic plans. These
have cited freezes on new staff and
library books and possible
redundancies as ways of saving
money. An overseer has been
appointed to help implement any cuts.
If the UCC account is not in the black
by 1990 then a planned merger with
the University of Wales will not take
place.

"The usefulness of an engineer
is proportional to the square of
the number ofpeople he knows"
Sir Harold Harding
Cynical at first glance, but don't get us wrong. A
nod, a wink and a funny handshake won't get even
an O C onto the Board of Directors. That isn't what
we are about. However, look at it this way. If you
try to learn everything for yourself from scratch you
will never learn enough. Much better to have
access to other people's knowledge so you can
take short-cuts.
Who was Sir Harold Harding? Well if you don't ask,
you'll never find out.
