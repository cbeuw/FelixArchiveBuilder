‘Tis the season for stand-up comedy DVDs
Chestnuts roasting on an open
fire, it’s beginning to look a lot
like Christmas, the goose is get-
ting fat. In other words, though you
may not know, not having ventured
outside South Kensington since the
second week of October, Santa is here!
And what better way to spend your
December money, freshly arrived
from your parents, on presents for
the people you love, including the
aforementioned? Luckily for the
uncreative, bored, lazy present buyers
amongst us (and that pretty much
accounts for most of the student
populace, excluding that girl from
halls who bakes cupcakes on Saturday
night and does separate washes
for colours and delicates) stand-up
comedians come to the rescue.
This may be because they realise
that Christmas is the only time of
year they stand a chance of selling
a DVD as opposed to everyone
streaming their shows in neat
10-minute parts on YouTube.
Nevertheless, these really make a
good present. And in addition are all
easily bulk-bought from Amazon:
just as long as you remember to do it
a couple of weeks before Christmas
and have it delivered to your London
address before going home.
For a father and bread-winner of
the family, I would recommend Al
Murray’s new One Man, One Guvnor
DVD, off The Pub Landlord series.
This comedy man may be slightly
politically incorrect towards women,
men, children, but he is also a
surprisingly lovable character, much
like everyone’s old Pops. This year’s
effort is not as valiant as 2012’s The
Only Way is Epic, but it’s guaranteed
the same amount of laughs around
the tree.
For your favourite brother, Russell
Howard has returned to theatres
after the hiatus to focus on his news
show Good News, with a brilliant
show. Wonderbox is a compendium of
what makes Howard one of Britain’s
favourite comedians. He is as sharp as
he is naïve.
His observations, sometimes cruel
sometimes innocent, will really speak
to the lover of fart jokes inside us, but
also to the more serious part of the
family. He is the quintessential good
boy that my grandmother would love
but I could still bear to spend time
with.
For your less favourite brother, or
the friend from home who you hate
but somehow haven’t yet disappeared
from your lives, I suggest Jack
Whitehall’s Gets Around. For the
particularly annoying humoured
soul, Whitehall is perfect, with his
unsubtle jokes about Jaeger Bombs
and his unhealthy obsession about
his father. I realise Whitehall is quite
successful, which is why he features
in the list, but personally I wouldn’t
bother unless the present is presented
with misery and resentment.
Your sister will probably enjoy
Sarah Millican’s Home Bird. See what
I did there? That’s not in any way
because Millican is a woman and
so only women can appreciate her
humour. Millican is someone who
everyone can enjoy, approachable,
affable and not as aggressive as many
other comedians, she tricks you into a
sense of calm like only your favourite
aunt can, and then says something
filthy that knocks you off the sofa.
This new DVD is as good as her
previous ones, if not better, and really
needs to be shared.
Finally, for your mother, and this
is only because out of the whole list of
2014 Christmas releases, this was the
one that would make me cringe the
least if I had to watch it in the same
room as her, Jon Richardson’s Nidiot.
Richardson personally delivers my
favourite joke of the season, as well
as making me feel less disappointed
with myself about never having
been on a drinking holiday to Ibiza.
Personally one of my favourite
efforts this Christmas.
On second thoughts, there’s a joke
about masturbating under a tree. Be
aware of this and maybe buy your
mother the last Downton Abbey (and
then escape from the house if she
decides to watch it).

Now in its fifth season, the
internationally successful
British series Downton
Abbey is set to return to our screens
for another Christmas episode. The
quality of the show has been varying
over the past couple of years, with the
most recent seasons not quite living
up to the high standards set by the
earlier years. And yet Lord Julian
Fellowes gives his audience enough
intrigue and character development
to keep everything going nicely.
There is a reason why this show has
become the most widely watched
television drama in the world. With
this Christmas episode the show has
the tough challenge of having to tie
up loose ends set up by the preceding
eight episodes of season 5. So what are
the plot points worth looking forward
to the most? Of course, watch out for
spoilers – don’t read unless you’ve
seen all the episodes on offer.

Lady Mary's quest for love
Ever since the show started, it
focused heavily on finding a suitable
partner for Lady Mary Crawley, the
eldest daughter of Lord and Lady
Grantham (Hugh Bonneville and
Elizabeth McGovern, respectively).
With her husband’s sudden death in
the third Christmas Special that sent
fans into a frenzy, Lady Mary has
since recovered and also discovered
her passion for sex outside of
marriage.
Sadly, things did not work out for
her and this gentleman, but rumour
has it actor Matthew Goode has been
cast to sweep Mary off her feet. Will
she finally be able to find happiness?
Only time will tell.
Rape, murder, more prison
time
The writers refuse to leave Mr John
Bates (Brendan Coyle) and Mrs Anna
Bates (Joanne Froggatt), the loveliest
couple the show has to offer, alone.
They have had their fair share of
troubles along the way, but the love
that binds the sweet couple together
has pushed them through this far.
But the season 5 finale saw the
pure-hearted Anna arrested for
murder of her rapist. She needs to be
released as soon as possible for the
sake of injecting some positive energy
into the show’s narrative.
And it would also be nice to close
the murder investigation and see who
really killed Mr Green.
Illegitimate child in the 1920s
Lord Grantham was surprisingly
cool about his second daughter
Edith’s (Laura Carmichael) big secret;
that she gave birth to a daughter with
her suitor who disappeared then died
before he could marry her.
Edith is no longer sulking and
looking miserable thanks to having
her daughter back at the Downton
Estate, so we will surely get a lot less
of her tiresome moaning, which is a
good thing.
A potential departure
There are constant, unwelcome
rumours of a cast member departing.
Tom Branson (Allen Leech) keeps
harping on about going to America
with his daughter Sybbie, the
Dowager Countess Violet Grantham
(Maggie Smith) is the go-to person to
pick on when guessing about who is
going to leave. Tom can go, but the
Dowager Countess absolutely cannot.
Even if her character is required to
die due to age, she needs to come back
as a ghost or something, haunting the
corridors of Downton Abbey.
Love is in the air?
There have been lots of hints
dropped throughout this season
that Mr Carson (Jim Carter) and
Mrs Hughes (Phyllis Logan) would
eventually hook up. They are perfect
for one another, and personally, it
cannot happen soon enough. How
long will they dilly-dally around just
keeping it a close friendship?
