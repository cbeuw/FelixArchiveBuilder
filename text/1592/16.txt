Winter All-Nighter 2014
As is Imperial tradition,
once again it is time for the
hallowed All-Nighter where
once a term we put on all the films
you’ve been dying to see, all in one go
and for ridiculous prices! With one
of our best lineups to date, what more
could you ask for?
Gone Girl - 18:00
Gone Girl is not quite the traditional
murder-mystery whodunit that it
seems on the surface. Nick Dunne
(Ben Affleck) runs a bar in a small
town in Missouri and lives in a
luxury house in the suburbs with his
beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike).
Their life seems perfect on the outside
but on the day of their 5 wedding
anniversary, Amy disappears. Blood
is left at the scene of their home and
suspicions fall on Nick who seems
strange and unemotional on camera
but denies any wrongdoing. As the
police race against time to find Amy,
it soon becomes clear that something
else is amiss.
Interstellar - 21:15
If all of your friends have been
flocking to IMAX theatres, chances
are there’s only one thing they’ve
been seeing-Christopher Nolan’s
latest film Interstellar! Crop blights
have decimated the earth and forced
regression back to an agricultural
society. Former NASA pilot
Cooper (Matthew McConaughey)
is recruited on one final space
mission to go through a wormhole
so that civilization can survive on a
new planet. As with all films set in
space, their mission is fraught with
complications not to mention the fact
that due to relativity, hours in space
are the same as years on earth which
takes its toll on the astronauts and
their relationships with their loved
ones. The result is that, Interstellar is
one of those rare films with spectacle
and heart in equal measure.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay
Part 1 - 00:45
The Hunger Games series continues
as following on from Catching Fire,
Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and the
rebels of District 13 begin to mount
their rebellion against President
Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the
Capitol. Haunted by The Capitol’s
capture of Peeta (Josh Hutcherson)
and her inability to do anything
about this, Katniss channels her
frustration into her new role as ‘the
face of the rebellion’ and participates
in propaganda videos denouncing
Snow to try and gain support for the
movement. The vindictive Snow
reacts by exacting revenge on Katniss
and her loved ones.
Nightcrawler - 03:15
In the past, Jake Gyllenhaal has
been typecast as a pretty boy due
to well, his dashing good lucks but
after seeing Nightcrawler be prepared
to see that categorisation well and
truly subside. Gyllenhaal loses 30
lbs (mostly from his morals) to play
Lou Bloom, an unemployed wannabe
entrepreneur who becomes enticed
by the world of LA’s nightcrawlers
who trawl the streets at night in
order to shoot footage of the latest
violent crimes and car crashes which
they then sell to news channels.
Lou quickly rises to the top of
his (dubious) profession through
blackmail, sabotage and practically
speaking murder. Those puppy dog
eyes are well and truly gone.
The Boxtrolls - 05:30
To end on a more uplifting note,
we have the stop-motion animated
film The Boxtrolls to guide you into
morning. In the fictional town of
Cheesebridge, the subterranean
Boxtrolls have garnered an unfair
reputation for kidnapping young kids
in the middle of the night when in
fact they are peaceful cardboard-box
wearing creatures which scavenge
at night to find materials for their
latest inventions. Cheesebridge’s
mayor strikes a deal with the chief
pest exterminator to rid the town
of as many boxtrolls as can be and
boxtrolls soon start disappearing.
Despite their reclusive nature, the
boxtrolls and Eggs, their adopted
human friend, work together to
rehabilitate their image.
