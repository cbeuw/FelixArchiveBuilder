Life, Death, and Dance in 1930s Soviet Russia
Fred Fyles is impressed by GRAD’s exploration of USSR ballet The Bolt
The ballet can be boring. There.
I’ve said it. As Arts Editor, you
would think it antithetical
that I could find dance deathly dull,
but in all honesty I can’t tell my plié
from my pointe, and have held a deep
dislike of the art ever since being
forced by my parents to attend ballet
lessons in my childhood (I protested;
they switched me to piano; everyone
was happy). So when attending the
Gallery of Russian Art and Design,
whose newest exhibition is centred
around a Shostakovich ballet entitled
The Bolt, I encountered one of those
all-too-frequent moments that made
me think: “well, perhaps I should
have been born in early 20th
century
Russia”
If I had been born in, say, 1911,
then (presuming I survived WWI,
the Russian Revolution, and the
ensuing Civil War) instead of being
sick to death of Swan Lake, I could be
sitting in the front row of The Bolt,
a work that seems miles away from
anything I have ever seen. For a
start, The Bolt is fun. Choreographed
by Fyodor Lopukhov, who worked
at the Bolshoi Ballet, dancers
in The Bolt took on machinistic
characteristics, using their arms and
legs to recreate the thunking and
clunking of heavy machinery in an
acrobatic celebration of the marvels
of modern technology. Lopukhov
was a dynamic choreographer, who
was focussed on uniting the worlds of
classical ballet and technical dance; a
resolute modernist, his work has been
reappraised as quietly influential
on a whole host of 20th
century
choreographers.
The plot of The Bolt – which would
prove to be its eventual downfall – is
relatively simple: Lenka Gulba, which
translates literally as Lazy Idler,
is a rube, whose only wish is to get
plastered with his gang of misfits;
determined to continue drinking,
they plan to disrupt the factory’s new
machine, convincing patsy Goshka to
drop a large bolt in the engine; luckily
shortly after enacting their plan
the gang is caught, with help from
Komsomol, the young communists’
league. Interspersed with variety
performances from the local factory
workers, the plot allowed for a cast of
archetypical characters such as ‘The
Petit-Bourgeois’, ‘The Job-Hopper’,
and ‘The Counter-Revolutionary’.
These characters were skilfully
brought to life by Tatiana Bruni,
whose bright, bold costume designs
form the majority of the exhibition.
A child of an artistic family, Bruni
grew up straddling two worlds:
although born in a pre-revolution
Russia, she graduated from art school
in the blinding light of the new
Soviet Union, with a government
that promised equality, justice, and a
dictatorship of the proletariat. This
optimism is reflected in her designs,
which are like constructivist marvels
transformed into children’s book
characters; the gouache drawings
still look as fresh as the day they
were made, and we have a number
of meticulously preserved costumes
used in the original show for
reference.
Unfortunately, the ballet fell foul of
the censors; following its premiere in
1931, critics panned the production,
and it was not to be performed
again for another 74 years. At the
time Shostakovich was the golden
child of Soviet music, but this would
not be the first time his work was
suppressed: his next ballet, which also
happened to be his last, was closed
after a negative review in Soviet
mouthpiece Pravda – entitled The
Bright Stream, it followed The Bolt in
his triptych of contemporary Soviet
life, and revolved around life on a
collectivist farm.
Ultimately, the reason for the
downfall of the ballet was its satirical
elements, which had no place in
the USSR of the 1930s, which was
increasingly moving towards Socialist
Realism as a preferred method
of artistic output. Although the
ballet included all the usual pro-
communist, anti-religion messages,
the characters were deemed to be
farcical, and therefore damaging
to the Soviet status-quo. Not only
that, but Shostakovich included
snippets of jazz and foxtrot into
his score, infuriating critic who saw
such styles as ‘Western imperialism’,
and Lopukhov was accused of a
‘dancification’ of industrial progress
– a serious error in the eyes of
governmental censors.
And thus The Bolt was consigned
to history. While there have been
a couple of revivals since the fall of
the USSR, very little interest has
been generated since; hopefully, with
the opening of GRAD’s exhibition,
we will see a renewed interest in
this ballet. The rare opportunity
to see Bruni’s designs in the flesh
is marvellous, since they can be
described as nothing less than
breathtaking. With their lyrical use
of colour, geometric precision, and
wonderful witticism, they should
rank in the highest echelons of
Constructivist art; Bruni deserves
to have a place in Russian art
history alongside luminaries such
as Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara
Stepanova, and Lyubov Popova.
The costume designs, alongside
GRAD’s informative supplementary
information – usefully provided on
iPads – allow us a glimpse at how
artistic institutions operated within
the governmental superstructure
that was the USSR. We learn that
the industrial sabotage that drives
the libretto is no mere plot device,
but an actual fear for many Soviets,
in no small part thanks to the 1930
Industrial Party Trial, during which
a group of ministers were accused
of plotting a coup. Bruni’s leaning
towards simple, childish designs is
perhaps explained by a quote from
Antonii Lunacharsky, Commissar
for Education, who saw the arts as a
perfect means for education a largely
illiterate population: “Agitation and
propaganda acquire particular acuity
and effectiveness when they are
clothed in the attractive and mighty
form of art”.
Thus ‘The Job-Hopper’ has a pair
of wings emerging from his derrière,
‘The American Navy’ character is
smoking a nuclear-missile cigar,
and ‘The Bureaucrat’ has been
transformed into a literal bureau,
a pair of stacked-paper legs bulging

out from a wooden desk. Her design
for ‘The Terrorist’ is particularly
enlightening; the worst fears of the
Soviet Union are given human form
as a thin woman wearing a voguish
hat and a sumptuous ballgown. Run
for your lives, the bourgeois are here!
GRAD have managed to not just
present a fine collection of art, but
– through archive photographs,
costume reproductions, and
Shostakovich piped through the
gallery’s speaker system – have
managed a near-impossible feat of
bringing a ballet to life. If it only gave
exposure to Bruni’s work, that would
have been enough, but GRAD goes
above and beyond, giving us an idea
of what life was like in the USSR, not
only for those in the artistic world,
but the general population too. So
next time you’re pining for a return
to the values of the USSR of the 1930s,
instead of calling everyone Comrade
and contracting TB, just pop down to
Great Titchfield Street instead, and
experience this modern marvel of
ballet.
