Council’s session on Tuesday 9th
was dominated by the motion
of No Confidence against the
ICURFC Club Captain, but the new
Higher Education Funding Policy
which was passed will probably have
even wider implications.
‘Higher Education Funding’ as
a term relates primarily to tuition
fees and who pays them, but also
comprises cost of living at University,
which is especially relevant to
London-based institutions such as
Imperial. Naturally, it is considered
one of the most important aspects of
student-based politics and therefore
one of the most important items of
student union’s political agenda.
The previous Higher Education
Funding Policy lapsed on 31st July
2014 (Union policies automatically
expire after three years), so for over
four months Imperial College Union
had no official stance on Higher
Education Funding: many on Council
reportedly found this concerning. It
was also considered imperative that
a policy be decided before the end of
term, so that campaigning can begin
well before the general election in
May 2015.
The two papers up for discussion
at the meeting, one proposed by
DPFS Alex Savell and one proposed
by Natural Sciences PG Ordinary
Member Andrew Tranter, were not
significantly different from those
tabled at the inquorate General
Meeting conducted on Monday 1st
December.
Savell’s paper referred to the
recommendations made in the HEF
Survey Analysis, which can be read
on the Union website. The main
campaign objectives were: to reverse
the increase in tuition fees from
£3,000 to £9,000 per year, to reduce
marketisation of higher education,
to introduce regulation of Overseas
and Postgraduate course fees, and to
increase the amount of government
support (loans and grants) given to
address cost of living.
Tranter’s proposal called on the
Union to “support and actively
campaign for free, funded, and
accessible higher education” and
called on the Union to “condemn”
tuition fee rises and increasing
marketisation of universities in
addition to campaigning against
them.
The five resolutions were voted on
separately: two which would have
changed the Union’s stance to a pro-
free-education one failed, and three
which strengthened the language
used in Savell’s paper passed.
“I’m pleased that we have a policy
that is reflective of the views of
students”, says Savell. “We have a
position to work from and can enlist
Union staff support.”
When asked about the role of
Imperial College itself, he said:
“where they agree with us, College will
help”, but that there are some areas
of “inevitable conflict”. “That’s why
we have a students’ union!” Imperial’s
management style is often criticised
as being overly commercial, Savell
explains that this is due to the “unfair
system” of marketisation: “We want
structural change.”
ICU’s new policy is unusual for a
student union policy in that it does
not call for scrapping tuition fees.
“Historically, I believe that we are
one of the more conservative student
unions”, explains Savell. “But we’re
definitely less conservative than
the Conservative Party!” Savell
believes that the policy could still
gain traction with Conservative
parliamentary candidates: “Imperial
students comprise future business
leaders….people with considerable
economic impact. These are the sort
of people the Conservatives target.”
Union staff and Officer Trustees
will be meeting today (Friday) to
discuss the next specific steps of the
campaign. The Union will be looking
to “engage the student population
and get them active”, but Savell
stresses that campaign efforts will go
ahead even in the case of a lukewarm
response from the student body:
“They’ve told us what they want, and
it’s our job to go and implement it.”
