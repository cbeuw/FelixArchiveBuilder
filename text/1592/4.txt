Imperial scientists working on the
Curiosity Rover have revealed
how water may have shaped the
landscape on Mars. Sanjeev Gupta,
a Professor of Earth Science from
the Royal School of Mines, teaches
multiple undergraduate courses
alongside his work with NASA on the
Rover, and was part of the team that
made the discovery.
Gupta analyses the rocks that
the Rover is sampling in a bid to
understand the geology of the
planet and decipher the ancient
environments Mars may have had.
The rocks feature particular
sedimentary patterns which suggest
that lakes have periodically formed
then evaporated in the large crater
the Rover has been traversing over.
Curiosity has been steadily travelling
across the crater towards the
mountain in the middle, and is now
looking at the rock patterns at the
base of the 5km high formation.
The lakes may have been formed
from snow running off the edges of
the crater and melting in the process.
Rivers carried sand and silt into
the lake too, which then settled at
the bottom. As this cycle repeated,
the sediment formed the base of
the mountain over tens of millions
of years and contributed to the
patterning of the rocks, known as the
Murray formation.
Felix spoke to Gupta about his
involvement in the mission, how he
balances working on Curiosity with
his teaching and the future plans for
the Rover. Gupta has been involved
with Curiosity since the launch, and
is a strategic planner for Curiosity.
Gupta liaises with the scientists and
engineers working on the mission,
and outlines the schedules and long-
term aims of the project to make
sure that everything stays on track.
He also works on analysing the data
collected by the Rover, which he does
from the comfort of his own home,
and here at Imperial.
Gupta told Felix about his
involvement with the mission: “It
is fantastic and I have a really good
insight into the mission having the
dual role that I have.
“Since the team is spread across the
world, we spend a lot of time running
around making phone calls, sending
emails and having discussions online.
I have to make a lot of economical
decisions too, as the mission is very
expensive. Every day we are under
pressure to keep moving, and collect
data too.”
He also told Felix that although
it is difficult at times to balance his

role with the Rover and his teaching
duties, the students are very excited
about the project. “My fourth year
class will actually be looking at the
Curiosity data and doing the same
sort of analysis we are doing as part of
the project.
“It is exciting to be able to transfer
that knowledge onto a younger
generation.”
Although Gupta explains that the
mission is not to find traces of life on
the planet right now, they are keeping
an eye out for organic compounds
that may suggest that there was life
on Mars in the past.
Analysis of rocks that make up the
surface of the planet indicate that
the bodies of water were larger and
remained for longer than previously
thought, and suggest that the climate
of the planet that allowed for this
may even have sustained microbial
life.
When water was present in the
crater, the conditions may have been
favourable for microbe survival, but
the life forms may have also resided
below the surface once the lake dried
out.
Models of the climate are yet to
prove that conditions would have
allowed for the lakes to remain for a
prolonged length of time, but does
suggest there may have been other
large bodies of water on the planet in

the past.
So what are the plans for the Rover
now? Gupta tells us that the Rover
is now going to slowly ascend the
mountain, and continue to analyse
the rocks as it goes along. “The
mountain was a risky target, but now
we have reached it, it makes sense
to start methodologically climbing
upwards.
“There is always pressure to keep
moving, and we’ve had problems with
rocks and holes and issues with cosmic
wind. However every day you don’t
drive on you may miss something
down the road.
“It’s terribly stressful, but at the
same time extremely exhilarating.”
