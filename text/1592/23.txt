Daring to Hope in the Face of Austerity

"The

"The play
does not
give us
solutions,
but rather
ways of
coping"
Fiscal responsibility and council
politics – possibly the most
unglamorous combination.
In this new play by Jack Thorne, the
story of a Labour council dealing with
crippling budget cuts is recounted in
a warm, human, engaging manner,
highlighting the absurd situation
that current austerity measures have
created.
Instructed to slash their budget by
£22m, the council has to decide where
to make the cuts: street lighting,
Sure Start children centres, exercise
classes at the Leisure Centre, or the
adult day care centre. The plot is
simple enough; the council already
operates on minimum budget, and by
cutting funding they can no longer
provide the services their area needs.
Each cut they make has a direct
consequence; closure of childcare in
a predominantly Muslim area causes
clashes and EDL rallies. Reduction of
street lighting leads to an increase of
violent crime. As the play progresses
the meeting between council leader
Hilary (Stella Gonet) and her deputy
Mark (Paul Higgins from The Thick
of It) become increasingly desperate,
as the impossibility of their task
becomes increasingly apparent.
Thorne manages to keep the story
real: despite the clear message, Hope
avoids becoming a 21st
century
cautionary tale. The fly-on-the-
wall effect is very strong, with each
new event managing to appear as a
natural, realistic progression rather
than moralistic point-scoring. This is
helped by the fact that each character
has a very different input to the
problem: the pro-protest, joint-
smoking councillor from the 80s; the
duty-driven council leader Hilary; the
mutinous but naïve young councillor
Sarwan; and the deputy leader Mark,
who sees the budget cut decisions as
a personal, difficult responsibility
rather than an unpleasant political
decision. The characters stick to
their belief, without their different
solutions being resolved into a clear
message. The play does not have a
solution to the budget cuts we are
living through, but it offers a way
of dealing with them: hope. Hope
for a better future, hope that people
will make the right choices and hope
that those choices will translate into
positive change. Mark’s clever, funny
teenage son Jake embodies this hope
with his witty, insightful comments.
After a national level scandal
caused by their decision to close
the adult day-care centre, Mark
and Sarwan decide to be the first
council in Britain to refuse the
budget they’ve been set. In an act of
defiance towards central government,
they hope to show the world that,
at local level, the austerity which is
being imposed on them is harmful.
The abstract number sent to them
by the government translates to
a dramatically diminishing in
the quality of life for the neediest
amongst us. It’s a very powerful
message; we cannot do what is being
asked of us. But their protests fall flat,
as popular outcry against the shirking
council means that their decision
lacks the all important media
support.
The overwhelming feeling of urgent
need for political change that Hope
conveys is elating. It is a left-wing call
to arms against the savage austerity
we’re living through, but also a very
funny piece on very real people.
Yes, my soul was stirred toward
righteous revolt against the absurd
Tory policies we’re subjected to – but
not so much that I couldn’t have a
good laugh at the awkward father-
son sex talks between Mark and Jake.
Political poignancy does not exclude
entertainment, as many politicians
should learn.
As the on-stage calendar flips to the
current date, Jake tells the nostalgic
ex-Labour leader “it’s possible I
will have a better life than you. It’s
possible the world will be better. Just
so you know.” That’s what we all
think, and that’s why we must have
hope in the future.
Hope is on at The Royal Court until
10th
Jan 2015. Tickets from £10.

SECTION EDITORS
The personal is political.And what
could be more personal than art?
Over the next few pages we will be
looking at the political influence
present in every single work of art,
from ballet and theatre,to opera
and art.
Firstly,Clara Clark Nevola heads
down to The Royal Court,whose
new play Hope centres around the
trials and tribulations of local poli-
tics; in a world of cuts and austerity,
this play asks why things need to be
this way.Taking place hundreds of
miles away–but no less personal
–The National Theatre’s 3Winters
looks at the impact political deci-
sions have on a single family living
in Croatia.An epic tale that remains
surprisingly intimate,3Winters is
bold and moving,according to Fred
Fyles.
Indira Mallik then takes us on a tour
of political art,and questions what
the differences are between protest
and performance art–if any.She
looks at at what writers and artists
have to say,as well as giving her
own personal opinion on the matter.
The theme of protest continues,as
we take a look at the relationship
between the oil industry and artistic
institutions in the UK,focussing on
BP and Shell.
We then take a look at the role the
state can play in the arts,heading
down to the Gallery of Russian Art
and Design,who are hosting an
exhibition around TheBolt,a ballet
composed by Shostakovich that
aimed to exalt the values of the
USSR,but ended up getting under
the government’s skin.
Finally,Kamil takes us on a tour of
London in winter time,telling us all
the best places to go over the holi-
days.Winter can be a bleak time for
the arts,but luckily there are options
for the culturally-inclined with little
to do this season.
We would also like to take this op-
portunity to advertise our arts mag-
azine Phoenix,which you can find
in the centre of this issue of Felix.A
display of art,poetry,photography,
and short fiction,all from students
at Imperial,it has been a frequent
joy,occasional nightmare to put
together.We are both inexplicitly
grateful to Matt Allinson,Phoenix’s
incredibly hard-working editor,and
all those who submitted their work
into us.We will be releasing another
issue next term,so let us know if you
are dying to show off any of your
work.
So that’s it for this year.In the words
of Friedrich Nietzsche:“Peace out
bitches.See you next year.”
