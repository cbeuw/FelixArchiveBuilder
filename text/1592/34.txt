Tuesday Sees the Latest Disaster
Sweeping TfL as Rugby Club Hit Council
Council played host to the
rejection of the motion of no
confidence against the Rugby
Captain this week. It was thought
that the success was slightly bolstered
by the presence of several groups of
sporting students, although rumours
are rife that only half of those
expected actually managed to turn up.
Several sources have revealed to
Hangman that many actually faced
issues reaching the venue due to
transportation complications.
Four students were severely
delayed after catching the tube
towards campus. The students
allegedly removed their jumpers due
to the heat, triggering mass panic
among the other commuters.
Said one woman, “I thought by
catching the Piccadilly line I would
avoid any more Imperial College
student nudity, but once I saw the
students beginning to strip I knew I
had to stop them offending any other
passengers.
“I pulled the emergency cord even
though we were between stations,
but thankfully it stopped the men
in their tracks. They didn’t even
manage to remove their ties.
“It was a miracle no-one was
hurt.” Another group of students
were left stranded on the side of
Hammersmith Road, after damage
to the window of a number 9 bus
resulted in all passengers having to
disembark from the vehicle.
Sources close to Hangman said that
the boys were sitting at the bottom
of the bus, and were quietly talking
when one of the party members got
up to help an elderly woman to her
seat.
As the bus lurched forward,
witnesses stated a metal drinking
flask was flung from his sports kit
in his backpack and smashed the
window on the opposite site of the
vehicle.
Said one witness, “It was absolute
anarchy. The bus wasn’t going at
full speed, thank the lord, otherwise
people might have been sucked out of
the empty window.
“If the bus hadn’t come to a stop,
we might have all been severely
injured, or worse.”
Several other students also tried
to get a ferry to Westminster, after
a late night training session based
in Greenwich. Whilst on the boat,
witnesses said that one of the boys
was complaining of feeling ill.
“He looked really pale, and kept
lolling forward then seemingly
Hangman Features Apparently
Legitimate News Articles This
Entire Time
Sources close to Hangman today
revealed that the features on this
page have in fact been genuine,
bona fide news for some time now,
and rest assured that no-one is more
surprised than we are.
The allegations surfaced during
a Union Council meeting, during
which an individual (who cannot
be named) used one of last week’s
‘articles’ as a supporting source in
their argument.
“At first, I thought they were
just Onion-style satirical features
designed to subtly mock aspects
of life at Imperial and, to a lesser
extent, Chris Kaye”, says Vanilla
Blancmange, a third-year EEE
student. “But then [redacted]
confidently referred to something
written in Hangman as fact and, well,
that was that.”
Hangman managed to secure
a statement from a Hangman in
response to the shock revelations:
“I don’t fucking know who I am
any more. I thought my job was to
bash out a few hundred words of
moderately witty dross every week,
never did I imagine that it would
all end up coming true. I’d advise
anyone born between March and
February to watch themselves over
the coming weeks. Now if you’ll
excuse me, I’m going to go drink
myself to death in the Felix office
in flagrant violation of the Clubs,
Societies & Projects Policy.”
Philippa Skett, the Felix editor,
was similarly surprised and even
questioned the allegations. “We
print news now?”, she asked, before
returning to her workstation
to manually change the colour
of dozens of digital snowflakes
individually in Photoshop.
In unrelated news, Hangman has
been nominated for a Guardian
Student Media Award for its
extensive coverage of new halls on
the Isle of Wight which students still
reckon will be better than Acton.
waking up. He must have been
absolutely wasted, it was disgusting.”
Medical teams were called to meet
the boat when the student could not
be roused, and his teammates looked
anxiously on as he was put into an
ambulance near Westminster dock.
It was later revealed that the
student was diabetic, and had
skipped dinner before their match.
His worried teammates accompanied
him to the hospital, and spent the
night by his bedside.
All in all, a total of thirty students
were unable to reach the Union
Dining Hall for 6.30pm to discuss
the motion of no confidence. Several
did make it as far as Beit Quad, but
were then distracted after walking
through the bar.
Said Wom Theeler, Union
President, on the lack of attendance:
“I thought more of them cared about
their captain than this, but it seems
once again boys will be boys and have
caused absolute chaos.
“We cannot confirm or deny at
this stage that we will be producing
a motion of no confidence against
the motion of the sporting teams
in general; it seems they purely
cannot be trusted to use any sort of
transportation system any more.”
When Hangman approached
Barclay’s Bike Hire to ask if they had
received any reports of disorderly
behaviour , a spokesperson replied:
“Not yet, but we reckon it will only
be a matter of time.”
