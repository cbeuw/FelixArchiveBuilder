Union Council saw the motion
of no confidence against
Imperial College Union
Rugby Football (ICURFC) Club
Captain rejected Tuesday evening.
33 members of council were in
attendance. 13 voted for the motion
of no confidence to be passed, 15
voted against it and 5 abstained.
Those who abstained included Abi
de Bruin, the Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies) who was on the
Governance Sub-Committee that
issued the vote of no confidence
in the first place. Paul Beaumont,
Council Chair, abstained but Tom
Wheeler, the Union President, did get
to vote on the motion.
The motion was proposed as one of
the sanctions set by the Governance
Sub-Committee a few weeks ago,
as punishments for members of
the team seen stripping on tube
platforms and causing a disruption to
the tube service at the end of October.
Many members of the ACC
committee, sports teams and other
club captains attended the meeting in
a show of support to Hobson. They sat
through an hour of debate concerning
other motions before reaching the
paper, submitted by Union President
Thomas Wheeler, proposing the
motion of no confidence.
The paper was not circulated online,
so was not open for any student to
see, but detailed how Hobson lied on
three counts during the investigation
into ICURFC. Wheeler told Council
how Hobson lied about how many
students were naked on the tube
during the incident, if they were fully
naked and if there was any alcohol
consumed.
In a statement to Council, Hobson
said that he deeply regretted what
had happened, and outlined how
“misunderstandings” between the
Union and the club itself did not aid
the investigation after the incident.
Said Hobson “I just thought the
Union is here to deal out punishment,
and I now know it is there to help
clubs.
“I do this role because I love the
rugby club, I’m not doing this for any
sort of CV points, and I would hate to
stop being the Club Captain.”
When asked as to why he lied,
Hobson said he was trying to protect
the club, and was wary of how other
Rugby clubs such as those at London
School Economics (LSE) had been

Confidence for Rubgy Club Captain

disbanded after incidents in the past.
Said Hobson, “I tried to protect my
members and the people there at the
time [of the incident]. I was doing it
with what I thought was my members
and club’s best interests at heart.”
These lies were told to the Union,
who then relayed them to the British
Transport Police (BTP). When the
BTP told the Union they had CCTV
evidence to the contrary, the lies
“made [the Union] look like idiots.”
Wheeler also clarified that the Union
is still unaware of the identities of the
individuals involved.
The four individuals are still in
talks with the police and have a
college disciplinary hearing this
afternoon.
The debate that then followed
lasted for over an hour, and involved
both members of council and those
who had showed to support Hobson,
despite only those on Council being
able to vote for or against the motion.
There was a lot of discussion about
the potential to issue a censure
against Hobson instead. A censure
involves a formal warning against
the behaviour. However, due to
the Union Constitution, this takes
five full college days so could not
be introduced during the council
meeting or added to the motion as an
amendment.
Wheeler also explained as to why
the censure wasn’t added in his
paper in the first place, stating that
“Writing it down would have made
it look like I was going after Tom
[Hobson], and I have tried my upmost
to remove anything that makes it
look like this is a personal attack.”
Debate also covered what effect
removing Hobson would have on the
functioning of the Rugby club as a
whole, and also addressed the wider
issues of the remits of volunteers,
their roles in the Union and also
how the club had already received
punishment.
One supporter of Hobson pointed
out that there was no other student
willing or capable of taking up the
role should Hobson be forced to step
down. “We can’t think of another
man who would step up, and we will
definitely be faced with turmoil for
the club as a whole in the future.”
Said another supporter of Hobson,
“The opinion of the rugby club as
to who should run the rugby club is
more important than that of anyone
else.”
Others discussed how the Athletic
Clubs Committee had already voted
unanimously to keep Hobson in
his position, and how their online
petition had amassed a further
600 approved signatures. Despite
“grilling” Hobson on what happened
during their own meeting, they
still decided that he should not be
removed from his role.
Although these votes had no power
in Council, students pointed out that
it showed that ACC was happy to keep
Hobson in his position too.
Members of Council were keen to
consider what sort of message passing
or voting against the motion would
send to other clubs and societies.
Said one attendee, “A vote of no
confidence would send the message
that a breach of trust [between the
Union and the club captain] cannot
occur and would not be tolerated,”
but another student was quick to
point out that Hobson, as a volunteer,
is not paid to fulfil his role and is
instead elected by his peers. Another
member continued, “The impact of
his removal will not be beneficial to
the club, and that seems unfair.”
After around an hour of debate,
the council was directed to vote using
paper ballots to allow them to vote
without others knowing how they
were voting. When the results were
announced, those who had turned up
to support Hobson cheered.
Thomas Hobson also spoke to us
after the meeting. He told Felix: “I
would like to thank everyone for
their support throughout this ordeal
whether it be signing the petition or
turning up on the night, it has made
this easy to deal with.”
“I am looking forward to working
with the union to help improve their
relationship with clubs and to try
and stop a similar incident from
happening again.”
Wheeler also spoke to Felix about
the motion. Said Wheeler: “I was
recommended to bring this Motion
of No Confidence to Council, by the
Union’s Governance Committee as
it is Council’s wish to make decisions
regarding Officer Confidence.”
“The discussion that followed was
very insightful, fair and constructive,
proving that Council is the
appropriate body to make decisions
concerning Club Officers.”
“It was imperative that the
representative role that Council has
was utilised during this decision
making process. The discussions
showed that the actions of a few affect
a large proportion of the rest of our
membership.”
“I fully support Council’s decision.”
The Chair of ACC, Oliver Benton,
said to Felix: “The ACC welcomes the
decision to not remove Tom Hobson
from his position as Club Captain.”
“A key point of discussion at
Council was the lack of understanding
by clubs of the Union's role in these
situations.:
“Tom has already expressed interest
in working with us to ensure that the
lessons learnt can be shared with the
whole ACC so that everyone is aware
of the Union's role in supporting
clubs through difficult situations.”
“He has also pledged full
involvement in ACC's drive to shift
sports culture away from excessive
alcohol consumption; as he remains
in office he will be much more able to
effect this change.”
“Hopefully we are close to drawing
a line under the whole situation so
that we can all go back to doing what
we love: playing sport.”
