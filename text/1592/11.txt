[Jet Propulsion Laboratory] over in
the US, but unfortunately the other
one stopped working a number of
years ago. Now, the only way to
calibrate the instrument is to roll the
spacecraft on two separate axes.
And what happens then?
We’re going to perform a close
gravity assist of Titan and then launch
ourselves into an orbit that takes up
through the ring plane. We’ll only be
about 7000km above the top of the
clouds then, so we’ll have to rotate
the spacecraft as well such that the
high-gain antenna, the big white disk,
is leading. This is to make sure that
if we hit any energetic dust particles
they put holes in the antenna and not
in the instruments!
Once that’s done, we’ll complete
22 orbits inside the rings. On the last
five orbits, lasting six days each, we
expect to have lost attitude control on
the spacecraft and it will be tumbling.
I want to be out at the control room
when it all ends.
It’s quite sad in a way that the
missions end like that. I remember
when Galileo ended in 2003.
Nonetheless it’s quite impressive
that the spacecraft has lasted this
long!
Yes, but the spacecraft is getting old
now. By the end of the mission it will
have survived ten years longer than
we expected it to. But my team are
already beginning the transition to
our new project, JUICE.
Ah, I’ve read about that! Would
you mind telling me a little about
JUICE before we finish?
So JUICE is a European Space
Agency Mission that will be
investigating the Jupiter system. My
role is very similar, I’m a principal
investigator and am building the
magnetometer again. I’m also the
leader of the science definitions team.
"The end of
the mission
will involve
flying
straight at
Saturn and
burning
up in the
atmosphere"
"I want to
be out at
the control
room when
it all ends"
We were selected four or five years
ago, and will begin building the first
lab model next year. We’ll then spend
a few years building the spacecraft, the
magnetometer will be built in the Lab
down the corridor [level 6, Huxley].
We’re due for launch in 2022, with
arrival at Jupiter in 2030. We’ll spend
at least three years in the system,
and in the last six months we’ll go
into orbit around Ganymede, the
largest moon in the Solar System.
We’re almost sure that there’s an
ocean of liquid water there, so we
want to measure the depth and the
conductivity.
The ESA [European Space
Agency] fund the spacecraft and the
operations, the UK Space Agency
is funding the instrument. They’ve
given us £4M, a lot of which will be
spend on personnel and the radiation-
hard parts that we will need to survive
around Jupiter.
That’s very cool – I look forward
to seeing how it goes! Thank you.
10 years
at
Saturn
Since its arrival at Saturn in
2004,the Cassini mission
has made some remarkable
discoveries. Huygens,a craft
carried with the Cassini orbiter,
made a controlled landing on
the moon Titan,discovering
methane rain,and dry lake beds.
1982
Joint working group formed
between European Space Agency
and US National Academy of
Sciences to organise a mission to
Saturn
15 October 1997
Cassini-Huygens launched from
Cape Canaveral on Tital IV rocket.
1998-2000
Flybys of Venus,the Earth and
Jupiter to provide gravity assists.
July 2004
Enters orbit around Saturn and
begins taking data.
January 14 2005
Huygens probe lands successfully
on Titan,discovering it to be
similar to Earth before life
evolved. This was the first time a
craft had landed on a body in the
outer solar system.
February-March 2005
Flyby of Enceladus discovers
a significant atmosphere,and
ice plumes originating from its
South pole.
June 2008
Main mission ends,Cassini
Equinox mission begins.
September 2010
Final mission,Cassini Solstice,
begins
December 2010
Enormous storm forms in
Saturn’s atmosphere,encircling
the planet over the course of a
few months.Cassini detects the
largest temperature increases
ever seen on a planet.
March 2011
Unexpected variation in radio
signals created by the Saturn’s
rotation seen. This data didn’t
fit with signal seen from the gas
giant Jupiter.
May 2017
Saturn summer solstice,final
major event Cassini will observe.
15 September 2017
Projected end of mission:
Cassini crashed into Saturn’s
atmosphere.
