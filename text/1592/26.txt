One of the highlights of the
Saatchi Gallery’s collection of
contemporary art is Richard
Wilson’s 20:50. Taking the form of a
vast lake of used oil, it creates a black,
mirrored surface that simultaneously
intrigues and repels. With its surreal
air, some visitors feel that the liquid
needs to be felt to be believed, only
to come away with a sticky residue
on their fingers that contaminates
everything they touch. Owned by the
gallery since 1991, it has been shown
in every space the gallery has moved
to, with its current iteration taking up
the entire basement of their building
just off Sloane Square.
Just like the Saatchi Gallery, the
Tate Foundation has its own dark
connection to oil; yet their river of
crude trickles down much further
than the basement, reaching down
into the core of the institution. I
am, of course, talking about the link
between The Tate Foundation and
their longest-running sponsors, the
oil giant BP. Their sponsorship deal
is no secret. Indeed, BP seems to have
obtained quite a lot of PR mileage
from the relationship, with an
estimated 30 million visitors to the
Tate exposed to their sprightly green
& yellow logo, and have expanded
into sponsoring a number of other
British artistic institutions, including
The British Museum, National
Portrait Gallery, National Theatre,
Royal Opera House, and Almeida
Theatre. But if you dig a little deeper
it seems that there are some things
that BP would rather keep quiet.
In July 2011, the Tate’s Ethics
Committee, which includes artists
Wolfgang Tillmans and Jeremy
Deller, recommended that their
sponsorship deal with BP continue.
In December it was announced
that BP would support a number
of institutions – including the
Tate – to the tune of £10 million;
shortly afterwards a petition
numbering 8,000 signatures was
delivered to director Nicholas
Serota, demanding that the Tate
Foundation immediately sever ties
with BP, largely due to their impact
on the environment. It was the
largest outcry since their relationship
began in 1990. The management
sat on the petition for a total of ten
days before giving the trustees less
than 24 hours in which to express
concerns before the matter was
dropped. This signalled the start of
a lengthy court battle lasting three
years, the outcome of which was that
the Tate Foundation was ordered by
the Information Commissioner to
comply to a number of Freedom of
Information requests regarding what
was discussed in their meetings with
BP. The Tate Foundation has since
appealed the decision, having signed a
confidentiality agreement with BP in
December 2011.
This incident marked the final
straw in a long line of indiscretions
from BP for many, including pressure
group Liberate Tate, founded in 2010
to highlight the ethical problems
posed by the relationship through
a combination of activism and
performance art. Thus far, their
protests have included Floe Piece
(Jan 2012), in which a piece of ice
was transported from the arctic and
allowed to melt in the turbine hall,
The Gift (July 2012), which saw a
group of activists transport a wind
turbine blade into the Tate Modern
to campaign for increased renewable
energy investment, and Human Cost
(April 2011), during which an activist
was stripped naked and covered in
oil in the centre of Tate Britain. And
they are not alone. Other collectives
such as Art Not Oil, Platform, and
To BP or Not To BP have all sprung
up over the last decade, opposing
sponsorship of artistic institutions by
oil companies.
So why is this a problem? Well, for
starters the record that BP has on
environmental issues is far from rosy.
One only needs to go back to 20th
April 2010, the day oil began seeping
into the Gulf of Mexico following an
explosion on the Deepwater Horizon
rig, to discover the impact BP has on
the natural world. Over the next five
months around 5 million barrels of
oil leaked into the ocean, decimating
the marine life in the area, perhaps
permanently. While the well was
declared sealed on 19th
September
2010, there are some reports that
state the well continues to leak. What
was once described by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Association
as “one of the most productive ocean
ecosystems in the world” has now
been forever altered; in some areas
up to 50% of fish are swimming with
open sores; during the first birthing
season post-spill, the number of
dead baby dolphins washing up on
Mississippi and Alabama beaches
increased ten-fold; and in 2013 NASA
stated that there was a “dearth of
marine life” in the area.
Not only has the spill affected the
area’s ecosystem, but the lives of the
inhabitants have also been altered.
In the initial explosion 11 workers
died, and since then the long-term
effects of oil exposure on clean-up
workers has begun to manifest, no
doubt thanks to the fact that they
were denied respiratory protection
and threatened with dismissal if
they complained. Furthermore,
many workers did not receive safety
training to use clean-up chemical
Corexit, a legal requirement. Medical
professionals are still reporting cases
of health problems in local residents,
with leading doctors predicting that
“liver and kidney disease, mental
health disorders, and developmental
disorders should all be expected”.
Tony Hayward, BP’s CEO at the time,
tried to play down concerns, saying
that the spill was “very, very modest”
compared to the size of the ocean. He
also sympathised with local residents
saying that he too “wanted my life
back”; this is cold comfort for the
population, who are still experiencing
disturbances to their health. One
study in particular found that a third
of children living less than 10 miles
from the Louisiana and Florida coast
had experienced unexplained health
problems, including bleeding from
the ears and nose.
In fairness to BP, the case could be
made that Deepwater Horizon was
an isolated incident, which no-one
could have predicted. The same
argument is difficult to make for
Shell, another oil conglomerate that
runs significant sponsorship deals in
the UK, including with The National
Gallery. Their activities in the
Niger Delta, where they turned the
government against the Ogoni people,
on whose land they were working,
can only be described as horrific.
Following complaints by local elders
that they were being exploited,
Shell suspended all activity in the
area; soon afterwards paramilitary
troops raided the villages under
orders from the government, and
Shell resumed their drilling. The
conflict reached a peak in 1995 with
the execution of activist Ken Saro-
Wiwa, who was accused of murdering
four Ogoni chiefs. Immediately
afterward Nigeria was suspended
