from the Commonwealth of Nations,
a ban that would last for three
years; in 2001 it emerged that two
witnesses had been bribed by Shell
to give false evidence at the trial; in
December 2003 Shell admitted that
“we sometimes feed conflict by the
way we award contracts, gain access
to land, and deal with community
representatives”; and in 2009 they
offered the family of Saro-Wiwa
$15.5 million in damages. They still
deny any wrongdoing.
It is clear that neither Shell
nor BP have any qualms about
destroying both the environment
and people’s lives in their quest for
further profit. Indeed, despite the
fact that research has found that
the two companies are responsible
for 4.59% of all CO2 emissions since
1750, both are now expanding their
operations in Canadian tar sands
and exploring the novel technology
of fracking. When the Tate, or any
other organisation, accepts money
from such an organisation, they are
implicitly giving their approval of
that company’s activities.
In essence, The Tate Foundation
is acting as a PR company for
BP, hiding their less-than-savory
practices under a thin veneer of
– that most patronising of terms –
public outreach. When one looks at
the economic argument it is small
wonder that BP decide to sponsor
the Tate: as of last year Deepwater
had cost BP $42.2 billion, with a
recent decision from the Supreme
Court that BP were negligent
possibly costing them a further $18
billion in the future; for a mere £10
million, spread around a number
of UK institutions, BP can gain
approval from the UK public. It used
to be that arms manufacturers and
tobacco companies sponsored artistic
ventures (the BP Portrait Prize at
the National Portrait Gallery used to
be sponsored by Imperial Tobacco),
and yet now the immorality of such
bodies means accepting funding from
them is beyond the pale; why is this
not the same for oil companies?
The approval from artistic bodies
need not be implicit either; Tate
director Nicholas Serota has made his
support for oil perfectly clear since
the 1980s when he, as director of
Whitechapel Gallery, first entered
into agreements with BP. Following
Deepwater, he made such sentiments
even more obvious, refusing to
capitulate to mounting pressure from
activists: “We all recognise they have
a difficulty at the moment”, he said,
“but you don’t abandon your friends
because they have what we consider
to be a temporary difficulty.” Such
loyalty is admirable, but perhaps
misplaced, especially when one
considers that the current Chair of
Trustees at the Tate Foundation is
Lord Browne, former CEO of BP
from 1995-2007, and current owner
of fracking company Cuadrilla
Resources.
For some, this level of intimacy
between the arts and big business is
not worrying. British artist Jeremy
Deller, who represented the UK at
the last Venice Biennale, sees the
relationship as inevitable, saying that
“art has always had links to power,
business, and politics”. This may be
so, but with the increasing reach of
international companies, it doesn’t
seem paranoid to be concerned
about the impact they could have
on what enters the gallery. In 2011,
environmental artist Chris Drury had
a work removed from the University
of Wyoming; entitled Carbon Sink,
it featured a whirlpool of blackened
logs on a base of coal, and acted
as a comment on the devastating
impact of the coal industry on
the state’s forests. Following an
outcry from Wyoming’s powerful
coal lobby, which was soon echoed
by state politicians, the piece was
removed, less than a year after it was
commissioned.
This may be an extreme example,
but while BP hasn’t – thus far –
removed works from Tate’s galleries
outright, the level at which they
censor material may be more
insidious. This is a sentiment echoed
by playwright Mark Ravenhill:
“If you spend night after night
entertaining corporates, you learn
their language”, he says, “It becomes
harder to talk to the whole of society.
I think there are very few examples of
direct intervention – it’s not like you
send them a script and see if they like
it. But it changes the culture. It’s more
gradual than censorship.”
When considering the extreme
secrecy that surrounds the Tate
Foundation’s dealings with BP -
despite the fact that 40% of their
funding is from governmental
sources – it doesn’t seem at all
feckless to question what influence
they may have over what is inside the
galleries.
Ultimately, whenever a discussion
concerns big oil and the arts, people
are made to face a choice; would you
want BP to stop sponsoring the Tate,
if it meant they would no longer
be able to function due to lack of
funds? I don’t doubt the importance
that arts has in this country, both
economically and socially, and for me
encouraging access to the arts is one
of the most vital things a government
can do (despite the opinions of
Secretary of State for Education
Nicky Morgan, who believes “the arts
hold kids back”), but this choice of oil
or nothing is false.
Instead, there is a third way, which
would involve the government
dramatically reversing the arts cuts
they have put in place thus far, and
extending the funding available to
the Arts Council. In the most recent
governmental budget for the arts,
the Southbank Centre, National
Theatre, and Royal Shakespeare
Company all faced cuts, ENO
funding was slashed by 29%, and
Barbican funding cut by 18%.
When such pressures are placed on
institutions, it is understandable that
they may look for funding anywhere
they can get it, be it from oil
companies or financial powerhouses.
But it also encourages a new
paradigm, in which the state refuses
to support the arts; a process has
been put in place – starting two
decades ago but significantly ramped
up in the last five years – by which
arts funding is thought of as an
unnecessary luxury, despite the fact
that they are economically sound
investments, returning £4 for each £1
invested.
As the world becomes more
and more interconnected, and
environmental issues such as climate
change move to the forefront of
people’s minds, it seems likely that it
will become increasingly difficult for
companies such as BP to defend their
activities. The interaction between
politics and the arts is becoming
increasingly unsettling, and people
are beginning to take notice; in the
wake of the recent Israeli-Palestine
conflict the Sao Paulo Biennale
dropped the logo of the Israeli
Embassy from their programme, and
North London’s Tricycle Theatre
refused to host the UK Jewish
Film Festival until the organisers
returned sponsorship from the Israeli
Embassy.
Last September, Liberate Tate
staged a performance piece in the
Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall;
entitled Hidden Figures, they held
up a giant black square, inspired by
the Malevich painting on display
at the time, in protest against the
censorship of information regarding
the sponsorship deals with BP. As
anti-oil sentiment becomes more and
more apparent, it seems likely that
such protests are the tip of a huge
iceberg with which the Titanic of big
oil is on a direct collision course. The
only question now is whether The
Tate Foundation will go down with
the ship.
