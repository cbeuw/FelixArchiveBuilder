A Warm Refuge from the Heart of a Bitter Winter
Fred Fyles lauds the National Theatre’s newest production of drama 3 Winters
For those of you who are cursing
the current cold weather,
being made to emerge from a
warm duvet cocoon in the mornings
into a cold, uncaring world, spare a
thought for those in Zagreb, where
the temperature in December
regularly drops to below zero. It is in
this climate that Croatian playwright
Tena Štivičić sets her play 3 Winters,
which premiered at the National
Theatre last week; a carefully
crafted drama, 3 Winters takes on
seven decades of Croatian history,
from their emergence from WWII
to their acceptance into the EU. By
focussing on four generations of the
Kos family living in Zagreb, and how
they cope being buffeted by the winds
of history, 3 Winters shows that not
only is the personal political, but the
political is personal
The action takes place in a single
ivy-clad house, which shifts through
generations thanks to Tim Hatley’s
impeccably precise stage design.
In 1945, partisan Rose lucks out in
housing allocation, thanks to her
associations with generals, moving
into the house in which she was born
in a bourgeois area of Zagreb, with
her mother, baby daughter Masha,
and husband, who is fresh from the
front after being conscripted onto the
losing side; in 1991 the family gather
in the house, Masha’s sister Dunya
returning from Germany to join
them for Rose’s funeral; and in 2011
Masha’s youngest daughter Lucia is
set to marry a venture capitalist with
questionable morals, Croatia is on the
cusp of becoming a full EU member,
and everything in Masha’s life seems
to be unravelling.
Director Howard Davies makes the
bold choice not to mark which period
we are in; the chopping and changing
of the furniture gives us a clue as to
how far we are through time, but
Štivičić’s script switches between
time zones every ten minutes. The
result is a play that, although difficult
to follow initially, works out in the
long-run; this is not quick theatre,
but over the course of 150 minutes, as
we move backwards and forwards in
time, the play unfolds like a beautiful
mid-winter flower.
The themes that Štivičić takes
on manage to be both vast and
intimate; throughout the play there
is an ideological battle between
the collectivist values that Masha
holds so dear, and those of Lucia,
whose celebration of neoliberalism
represents a Croatia that is keen
to let the past be the past. Štivičić
uses her cast of characters to
represent different values; capitalist,
communist, fascist, elitist, these
all get a look in. With some other
writers, this battle may seem heavy-
handed, but Štivičić’s use of the house
as a microcosm of Croatian society is
handled with a deft touch.
At times, this conflict shifts
into melodrama, exemplified in
the characters of Lucia, the proto-
capitalist of a new Europe, and her
older sister Alisa, returning from
Britain on a break from her PhD
and horrified by her sister’s decision
to evict all the tenants of their
palatial home. The two characters are
played against each other from the
beginning, and – aside from some
moments where the frost thaws,
particularly in the last scene, fierce
in its fiery intensity – in general lack
nuance. Perhaps Štivičić felt that
the script needed a further injection
of drama, but when one looks at
Croatian history is seems that conflict
is one thing not in short supply.
Overall, one of the things that
3 Winters does best is explore the
impact of national crises on the
individual family unit, especially the
ability that women have to adapt to
a history driven largely by the action
of men. In the Kos household there
are four generation of women, who
have survived frostbite, starvation,
war, insanity, domestic abuse, and
the death of all they hold dear,
both individuals and ideas. At the
centre of this matriarchal clan are
sisters Masha and Dunya, played
with exceptional verve by Siobhan
Finneran and Lucy Black; Finneran
especially imbues the stage with a
firecracker tenacity bursting through
a calm, collected facade. Masha is a
woman in dire pains, whose life has
moved from upset to upset; now, on
the eve of her daughter’s wedding,
she tries to hold things all together,
"The play
focuses
on four
generations
of the Kos
family, and
how they
are buffeted
by history"
for just one day more. As she sees
everything that she held dear moving
away from her, a crisis of conscience
is provoked: “they think our values
are quaint” she cries, lamenting what
she sees as the death of society.
With four generations of mothers
and daughters under one roof, Štivičić
has crafted a retinue of strong female
characters: Rose, a former partisan
fighter who battled against the fascist
dictatorship from the woods; Monika,
who was dismissed from her job as a
maid following being impregnated by
the lord of the house; and Karolina,
the flame-haired former owner of the
house, whose Nazi father put her in
a mental hospital, and associations
with aristocracy place her under
threat in a new Croatian state. It has
been far too long since such a cast
of strong women have graced the
stage, played with equal verve by the
competent cast.
With its radical approach to
time, and unwillingness to follow a
conventional chronology, Štivičić’s
3 Winters may initially seem like
an exercise in cold intellectualism;
however, this is a play, Chekhovian
in ambition, that deserves your full
attention before it reveals its true
value. Winter in Zagreb may be brisk,
but Štivičić and Davies allow us to sit
at the hearth of a family home, and
bask in its warm heart.
3 Winters is on at The National
Theatre, until 3rd
February 2015. Tickets
start from £15.
