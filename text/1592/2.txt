SKETT’S BOX OF SHAME
We couldn’t spot any errors in
issue 1591, which is probably an
error in itself.
Do let us know if you could find
any.
For the last issue of the term,
we have turned Felix festive.
We also have the added gift of
Phoenix, the Felix Arts Quarterly.
Phoenix was what Felix originally
used to be; a student newspaper ran
by students and read by students. It
now is printed roughly once a term,
and contains poems, short stories,
pictures and photographs to show
that, for a STEM university, we are
actually quite arty too. Thanks so
much to Matt Allinson, and my Arts
team who helped put this majestic
24-page piece together.
In news this week we have the
fallout from a staggeringly long (3
hour!) Union council meeting on
Tuesday. The debate over how a
student volunteer should act, what
their role should really involve and
how this is communicated between
the Union and club officers was long
and thorough.
It seemed to resonate through the
Council when one supporter of the
Captain mentioned that Hobson is
purely a student, and is doing the role
because he enjoys it and was voted in.
Personally, I thought it seemed
uncomfortable to usurp him from
his role, as enthusiastic volunteers
are the backbone of the Union; they
can also seem few and far between
at times. Felix is run completely by
volunteers who work with me to make
a paper week on week, and although
I’m paid if my section editors, copy
editors, photographers and writers
decided not to come in one week, no
doubt there would be no paper.
I hope this incident highlights
the need for further dialogue
between clubs and societies and their
volunteers, as the Union isn’t really
there to just scold students.
The Union is there to look out for
students: not mentioned in news
this week but still worth a mention
here is that Alex Savell, Deputy
President (Finance and Services)
is now campaigning to reduce the
charges international students pay
for transactions to the College. This
brings us nicely in a circle to the
start of the year when the Union was
campaigning to stop the introduction
of NHS fees for international
students too.
We pretend we hate the Union
sometimes at Felix, mostly because
it annoys the overlords and it makes
us laugh in the office when we take
the piss. In reality, we have realised
this year that we are pretty lucky to
function as a publication in the way
that we do. We’ve heard of papers
being pulled by Unions, or Unions
demanding that they read the paper
before print, something Felix has
been lucky to avoid.
Does the union manage to
overcome College’s apparent “money-
making” schemes? Not often. They
also seem to think a campaign is
solely driven by hash tags and cyan
and magenta leaflets, but they do
mean well.
So we would like to thank the
Union for not fucking us over this
year. We promise we will try not to
fuck you over too in 2015.
