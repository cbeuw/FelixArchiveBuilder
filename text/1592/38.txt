Imperial Swingers hit the mark
by Imperial students, with one
notable exception: the Swing Dance
class on Sunday, led by Katie from
London-based Swing Patrol. This
forms part of a longer term plan to
start running swing classes on a more
regular basis at Imperial.
Special thanks go to ICU Dance
Company and Funkology for the
generous use of practice space, and to
all of the volunteer choreographers
who ran classes.
Following on from the Workshop
Weekend, the collaboration, titling
itself ‘Dance Imperial’ (DI), is aiming
to produce a show to run in the last
week of term, with acts from all
of the existing dance societies and
some fusion acts put together by
choreographers who met during the
event. There are also plans to run
a similar event in the Spring term,
offering a wider variety of styles and
types of dance.
If you want to know more about the
collaboration, the show or the next DI
Workshop Weekend, please feel free to
get in touch at danceicu@gmail.com.
Over the weekend of Saturday
15th
November, Imperial’s
dance societies combined
forces to run a Pineapple style open
day, offering classes ranging from
Salsa and Swing Dancing through to
Hiphop, Break and Belly Dance.
The event saw over 100 different
students attending classes over the
two days, with many attendees able to
try out classes in styles they’d never
tried before.
In addition to the styles that
have been running for some time,
the event also saw Pole Dancing’s
Strength & Conditioning class and a
Musical Theatre Jazz class to ‘Shake
Your Tail Feather’ from The Blues
Brothers.
The majority of classes were taught
"The
event saw
over 100
different
students
attending
classes"
Bridge team place in London Cup
Imperial came back the proud
owners of the second place trophy in
last week’s London Cup–the annual
inter-university bridge tournament
attended by teams from around the
UK.
The Imperial team came in second,
narrowly losing out to the victors
from Cambridge University in an
incredibly tight score-line; after 48
rounds of play the final score saw
Imperial and Cambridge with equal
victory points and wins,only losing
out when the head-to-head score
was evaluated.
Imperial was represented by two
other teams in the competition,and
faced opposition from rival London
universities LSE and UCL as well
as a team who came down from
Warwick.
The competition marked the first
of this academic year’s bridge
tournaments,and showed that
despite losing some of the more
experienced players at the end
of last year Imperial is still a
formidable force in the bridge
world.
“It’s a good result to start the year
on,and I hope that it’s indicative
of the competitions to come”
commented the club’s president.

C&S Editorial: The
Arts Issue
This week we have not one,not two,but eight
Performing Arts societies featured. Eleanor Glennon
& Joseph Hosier’s review of Dramsoc’s ROAD can be
found over the page,together with articles about the
upcoming dance collaboration and MTSoc’s autumn
term.
This is also a big issue for new clubs and societies.
Following on from last week’s editorial,there is Owen
Leech’s MetalworkGuildatImperial; there’s already
been interest in the Felix office,and I’ve been told that
a few people have already emailed ahead.
Lots of exciting things starting next term,starting in
the first week with AweekinthelifeofFelix,the first
of a series of club spotlights looking at clubs’weekly
activity.
We’re also looking at how the New Activities
Committee works,and talking to the Union about
ways to get society news like Dominic Price’s Bridge
Club match report out.
As ever,we are on the lookout for content! If you’d like
to get involved,want your club to be featured in Week
intheLifeof... or have any other ideas for the section,
get in touch at felix.clubsandsocieties@imperial.ac.uk.
Until then,have a fantastic Christmas,and see you in
the New Year!

Imperial’s first
Dance Open Day

of a full show. Additionally, this
year there were a number of musical
directors from the A Cappella society
and the Royal College of Music.
Over 300 people attended the three
day run, which played to full houses
on Thursday and Friday night.
Rehearsals began in mid-October,
directly following the October show,
Acting! With many of the cast having
only just joined the society, the
pressure was on, and a minimum
of 12 hours of rehearsal every week
The Musical Theatre Society
(MTSoc) ended their Autumn season
last week with an all-singing, all-
dancing musical revue. Carrying The
Banner featured numbers from a
spectrum of different musicals and
cabaret acts, including Wicked and
Avenue Q.
This is the third consecutive year
in which MTSoc has abandoned
any pretence of a storyline to allow
society members to try directing and
choreographing without the pressure
kept everyone busy. During the two
weeks preceding the show, there was
rehearsal or a band call every day.
The Artistic Director, Harriet
Campbell, praised the cast’s
motivation and good spirit, saying
“They’re my favourite cast ever… not
just because they’re my cast.”
Next term, MTSoc will present their
Spring Show, Merrily We Roll Along by
Stephen Sondheim. Auditions continue to
run next week; contact musicaltheatre@
imperial.ac.uk for more details. The cast relax during a break in rehearsal. Photo: Shankho Chaudhuri
