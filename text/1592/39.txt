Metalwork Guild at Imperial
Well, what can I say?
Blacksmithing is one of
the most rewarding things
I have ever done. The satisfaction
that you get from turning a lump of
dull metal into something useful or
beautiful, and on the rare occasion
both, is incomparable to anything
else!
Don’t get me wrong, a skill like this
is very tiring and difficult to master
and as such, coupled with modern
manufacturing, it is a profession that
is dwindling.
I have been lucky enough to have
the opportunity to volunteer as a
17th
century blacksmith at a first
person re-enactment village where I
have been able to develop my basic
understanding of metalwork. It also
gave the challenge of working with
period tools which means no power
hammers, no electricity, etc. just the
sheer will and man-power to heat a
piece of iron to 800o
C and then bash,
bend and bully it into the desired
shape and size.
Over the few years that I have been
“Are you fucking mental
altogether?”
“I’ll kill you Brian, I’ll kill you — I’m
not joking.”
An ambitious and creative
production, ROAD presents
a bleak look at Thatcherite
Britain in a northern town. The
play leads us through the lives of
the residents on a typical gin-soaked
Friday night – from immediate and
brutal violence to bawdy drunkenness
and heartbreaking fragility. Almost
thirty years after its debut, this
play has lost little of its ability to
shock an audience. Jim Cartwright’s
voyeuristic exhibit of the warts and
all goings on of this single street
reflect the resentment and very real
fear of poverty felt in the hard hit
north at the time, not so far from
the imaginations of this recession’s
generation.
These relentlessly grim lives with
a sometimes fatal lack of hope for
the future play out with unremitting
realism. Bare lightbulbs cast stark
light and moody shadows on a series
of brightly wallpapered rooms that
surround the audience. This created
world extends into the interval
where the audience is drawn into the
debauchery of this long and drunken
night.
Jumpsuits, shoulderpads, Dr
Martens and double denim coupled
with an aggressively eighties musical
backdrop transport the audience to
a forgotten era. All this creates an
immersive theatre experience that
succeeds in bringing the audience
into the centre of the lives of the
ROAD residents.
The ensemble cast deliver
some nuanced and convincing
performances, with countless
stand-out monologues in this epic of
grimness and austerity. Our narrator
and anti-hero, Scullery, first played
by Ian Dury of Hit Me With Your
Rythm Stick fame is here taken on in
all its leering grotesque glory with
fresh energy by Oscar Gill.
Adam Lawrence’s performance as
Skin-Lad was particularly polished
as he successfully captured the
audience with his stage presence
and intense physical rage. An
unparalleled commitment to the role
saw Lawrence embrace skin-head
authenticity by actually shaving off
his majestic golden locks of flowing
shoulder-length hair.
Andrew Finn brings a sickeningly
vivid depiction of helplessness,
anguish and bitterness as his
character Joey struggles to come to
terms with life’s lack of meaning.
This anger is accompanied by Lizzie
Riach’s romantically fatalistic
Clare, cutting a pitiful figure as she
gradually fades away.
The final scene epitomises the
uneasy emptiness of the lives we’ve
glimpsed on ROAD, with Emma
Little as the mouthy and world-weary
Carol and the haunting pain and
chilling desperation of Hasan Al-
Habib as Eddie.
The pathos of Brink and Louise,
played by Steven Kingaby and Issy
Lucas respectively, complemented
the scene perfectly as these four

characters try to find some way to
escape their inner torment. Together
voices build to a crescendo that is
fully charged and leaves the audience
with the helpless and hollow feeling
that director Tom Cunningham
intended.
Without a glimmer of hope or
brightness, sometimes uncomfortably
honest and occasionally hilarious –
this is one from DramSoc that is not
to be missed!
ROAD is running Wed 10th
-Sat 13th
December in the Union Concert Hall.
Tickets are available on the door or
online at imperialcollegeunion.org.

practicing smithing, many people
have said to me “Wow! That must be
really fun, I wish I could have done
that!”. This got me thinking: why
can’t we have a metalwork guild at
Imperial?
I’m aiming to set up said society
in order for anyone interested in a
particular type of metalworking to be
able to learn and practice.
If you are at all interested, or have any
questions, then please don’t hesitate to
