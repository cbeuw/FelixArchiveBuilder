At the Frontiers of Art, Performance, and Protest
Indira Mallik asks: where do revolution and artistic expression collide?
"True
protest,
going onto
the streets,
carries with
it dangers
that art
rarely ever
does"
In recent years, the idea of
revolution and protests has barely
left the public consciousness, or
our TV screens. From the Arab Spring
across Syria, Libya and Egypt to the
recent protests in Ferguson and New
York against police brutality, protest
has spread to all corners of the world.
The Disobedient Objects exhibition
currently at the V&A is a collection
of badges, banners and placards
that have played an integral part
in protests across the world in the
20th
century. The Porter Gallery
has been injected with a touch of
the revolutionary spirit, with seven
metre high carbon fibre gallery doors
emulate barricades made iconic by
the French Revolution. Colourful
banners, the largest of which declares
“Capitalism is Crisis” in vivid peacock
hues, give the air of a renegade camp;
screens throughout the gallery project
show scenes from demonstrations
and protests, the chants clashing and
harmonising to create a space unlike
any other.
So what exactly is meant by ‘objects
of disobedience’? The consensus is
that they are items that have joined a
movement together, allowing people
from all walk to life to connect with
causes beyond their own experience.
But the exhibition is keen to point
out that there is no ‘protest aesthetic’.
The tokens that become iconic of a
particular cause are determined by
the context of the communities in
which they are formed. Folk art or a
particular phrase can be translated
into a brand and circulated with
technology. This is something we are
seeing more and more of, recently
#Icantbreathe went viral on Twitter
as people all around the world took
to the internet to voice their dismay
at a grand jury failing to indict the
police officer who was filmed putting
Eric Garner in an illegal chokehold
in New York earlier this year; “I can’t
breathe” is repeated by Garner 11
times as the officer tries to restrain
him, before harrowingly falling
silent.
In the critical essay The Frontiers
of Art and Propaganda George Orwell
writes “you cannot take a purely
aesthetic interest in a disease you
are dying from; you cannot feel
dispassionately about a man who
is about to cut your throat”. Orwell
writes about the death of pure
aestheticism, the end of creating
art for art’s sake. There have been
numerous examples of art that
disguise a political agenda. The
question that gripped me whilst
walking through Disobedient Objects:
can the objects of propaganda ever
be Art?
It all comes down to how we define
art. For me, there must be some
aesthetic element; all pieces of iconic
art have the power to command
the viewer’s attention and remain
in the viewer’s mind. The power of
propaganda lies in how quickly the
idea spreads and is taken up, and
having a strong symbol that binds
protesters together is an important
part of achieving this. One of the
most poignant example is that of the
pink triangle that formed ACT UP’s
‘Silence=Death’ campaign, which
aimed to fight homophobia and
inaction during the AIDS crisis in the
1980s; they inverted the symbol used
in Nazi concentration camps to mark
out gay men as a call to arms.
Images often lead the vanguard
of political protests. Protesters
opposing the expansion of Heathrow
Airport used shields portraying
faces of villagers across the world in
places such as Bangladesh, seeking to
draw attention to the human costs
of climate change. In 2011, as Italy
faced education budget cuts, students
took to the streets carrying huge
cardboard and Plexiglas versions of
classic book covers used as shields to
push back against the police batons
and charges. In 2011 the London
Book Bloc campaign released a
statement saying “when the police
baton us… we will see not only police
violence against individuals but the
state’s violence against free thought,
expression and learning… books are
our tools, we teach with them, we
learn with them, we create with them,
and sometimes we must fight with
them.”
It is exactly this sort of passion
that elevates protest emblems into a
type of art. Increasingly in art what
matters is the concept – Banksy in
particular is infamous for blending
strong political ideals with his street
art. The blurring of the boundaries
between art and propaganda has
"They
are items
that join a
movement
together,
allowing
people to
connect
with causes"
already started to happen at the
highest echelons of art.
One of the leaders of this
movement are a group of anonymous
American female artists who
call themselves the Guerrilla
Girls . Branding themselves “the
conscience of the art world” they
have been exposing sexual and racial
discrimination in the art world since
their inception in 1984. The group’s
members wear gorilla masks in public
to protect their identities and subvert
the objectification of female artists
that still takes place in the art world.
One of their most famous pieces, now
on exhibition at the Tate, depicts a
Rokeby Venus-esque nude wearing a
gorilla mask alongside the statement
“Do women have to be naked to get
into the Met. Museum? – less than
5% of the artists in the modern arts
section are women, but 85% of the
nudes are female”, protesting the lack
of equal representation.
Such a bare political statement
being exhibited as art in one of the
highest regarded galleries in the
world echoes Bertolt Brecht: “art is
not a mirror to reflect the world,
rather it is a hammer to shape it”.
Art is about an enduring concept,
and more importantly, a passion that
transcends the artist and infects the
viewer. There is no more immediate
and powerful way to try and capture
this sentiment, to try to shape the
world, than protest.
The image of crowds marching and
often chanting in unison can seem
like performance art on an epic scale.
But to lump the two in the same
category would be dishonest. True
protest, the act of going back onto the
streets despite risk to life and liberty,
carries with it dangers that art rarely
ever does. Even as the ideas of art and
protest intertwine, it would be wrong
to class protest entirely as art.
It is tempting to try to beautify
protest; it is easy for us to regard the
spirit of revolution as something
inherently romantic, to glamorise
the overthrow of despotic regimes
by civilians. It is this need to create
such a poetic theme that plagued
the broadcast of the Arab Spring by
mainstream media. Catalina Ferro’s
Manifesto puts it better than I ever
could:
“I know what the price of smashing
the system really is, my people already
tried that./The price of uprise is paid in
blood/And not Harvard blood…./It is easy
to say “revolution” from the comfort of
a New England library./It is easy to offer
flesh to the cause/When it is not yours
to give.”
Disobedient Objects is on at the V&A
until 1st
February 2015. Entrance is free.
