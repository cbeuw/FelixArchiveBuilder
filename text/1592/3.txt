Felix wraps up a stellar 2014

It has been a busy year for Imperial
College, with the Union and the
University alike giving Felix lots of
material and good reason to go to
print (most of the time).
In January, College announced it
would be conducting its Residential
Experience Review, something we
would see the results of this term with
the reductions to the amenities fund.
The work of Imperial College
Union campaigning against charges
for International students to use
the NHS also lead to an inquiry
by the House of Lords Science and
Technology Committee. The inquiry
set out to look at the changes a new
immigration bill would have on
students who come from abroad to
study, which would include charging
people a flat fee to access healthcare.
We said goodbye to the Science
Museum Library, with the collection
on the third floor being moved
outside of campus and the space
renovated for students to study
in. The Union also announced the
refurbishment of the Union Concert
Hall with a £220,000 grant, although
this was not to be completed in time
for the next academic year.
YoYo hit campus with its bright
pink payment app, and bars all over
campus braced themselves for the
numerous technical difficulties that
followed before accepting this new
way of payment and for some, a new
way of life. One student told us “It’s
like we aren’t even really paying, so
I spend quite a lot of money at sport
nights now.”
It came to light that the Chemistry
building may be moving to the
Imperial West campus, something
that is still being planned and
prepared for now although the
moving date has yet to be set.
Imperial joined together with
the best vacuum cleaner company
around, Dyson, to launch a
new robotics laboratory in the
Department of Computing. The
lab does not however carry out
research to develop new, innovative
cleaning products but instead looks at
expanding artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, students in the library
were caught mining bitcoins late at
night, and were promptly banned by
the ICT department.
In March we saw the Medics win
the Rugby, but College to win overall.
Imperial hit 13th in the Times Higher
Education rankings, still 11 places
shy of where it would reach in the QS
Rankings in a few months time.
It was announced that Evelyn
Gardens would close in 2015, and
it was not clear if the halls would
open again. It was also announced
that the library would finally get air
conditioning, only for this glimmer
of hope to be snatched away.
It was revealed that although
planning permission was granted to
build the cooling system, funding
was never awarded to pay for the
complete electrical and mechanical
overhaul needed for the library to be
able to sustain the system.
However, it wasn’t all bleak news:
Imperial received a £40 million
donation from alumnus Michael
Uren to build a new Bioengineering
building at the Imperial West
Campus. Uren graduated before Felix
even existed, in 1943.
Although Bioengineering may have
been having a great time, Medicine
saw the doors shut on its four-year
postgraduate course, introducing
a new five-year course instead for
graduate entrants.
Medics were also left displeased
when they heard their sports grounds,
Teddington, were to be closed and
all sport was moving to Heston.
According to those involved, the
following summer months were
plagued with miscommunication
issues about the closure.
Felix returned for the new
academic year as Alice Gast succeeded
Rector Keith O’Nions to become the
first President of Imperial College.
She is the 16th head of the University.
Cheerfully, the home office dropped
allegations of animal cruelty at
Imperial. Out of 180 allegations from
the British Union for the Abolition of
Vivisection, only five were upheld.
Teddington held its final day of
sport in October, a few weeks after the
new intake started back at Imperial,
and although a Dri night at the Union
was scheduled in the first fortnight of
term, some were left unimpressed by
the turnout.
There was controversy as Felix
revealed that the College had cut
amenities funds for halls by more
than half. The amenities fund was cut
from roughly £373,000 to just over
£150,000.
The first of two controversies
involving the rugby teams hit on
Halloween (we’ll never forgive you
guys for knocking the pumpkin off
the front page). The Rugby First
XV were caught stripping on tube
platforms, while medics were caught
running around Heston naked. The
following week, the Medics rugby
club was suspended for smashing a
coach window whilst on tour.
A petition was launched against
potential redevelopment work
at Silwood Park, although it
remains unclear what exactly the
redevelopment would entail. It also
remains unclear whether the project
will go ahead.
At the end of November,
Blackboard crashed during an online
exam. As many as 450 students were
left “confused and frustrated”, as the
test at the Business School had to be
halted and disaster swept through the
department.
Meanwhile, the Higher Education
Funding policy was garnering online
support, although the same could not
be said for the Bursary change, which
was “condemned” by Union Council.
The Union attempted to hold
a General Meeting about Higher
Education Funding at the start of
December, but the meeting failed
to meet quorum. Only 45 people
attended the meeting, some way short
of the 200 required.
The sad news of Professor Grimm’s
death made it onto the front page
last week, and it seems the story is far
from over. We may be able to provide
more information in 2015, so watch
this space.
Many of our main stories from this
year have yet to reach a conclusion,
so we will be following up on these in
the New Year. Don’t forget to pick up
your copy of Felix on the first Friday
of the Spring term.
