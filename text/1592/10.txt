Could you please tell me a
little about exactly what your
involvement in the mission is?
I am the principal investigator on
the magnetometer instrument, one
of 11 different instruments on the
spacecraft. Our team is investigating
the magnetic fields and features
around Saturn and its moons. I’ve got
12 co-investigators and their postdocs
working on this, so I spend quite a lot
of time coordinating what we do.
So what did you do on the way to
Saturn?
We spent about four years
timetabling what we were going to
do when we got there! There are a
huge number of people who want
to be taking readings of particular
things at particular times, and to
sort out exactly how we were going to
fit things in took some rather frank
phone calls.
We also took the opportunity to
check our instruments, so when
performing our fly-by of the Earth in
1999 we deployed the magnetometer
boom to check that everything was
working properly.
If you look at a photo of the
spacecraft, you’ll see a long boom
sticking out of one side. The
magnetometer instruments are
housed at the end of that, and are kept
away from the body of the spacecraft
to ensure our readings are accurate.
So what’s the outlook for the next
few years on your instrument and
the probe as a whole?
We’ve been granted a mission
extension to September 2017. At that
point, the radioisotope thermoelectric
generator that powers the spacecraft
will no longer be able to power
things enough to maintain accurate
orientation and spacecraft control.
As with the Galileo spacecraft
orbiting Jupiter, we want to make
sure that we don’t contaminate any
of Saturn’s moons with debris or
bacteria from Earth – so the end
of the mission will involve flying
straight at Saturn and burning up in
the atmosphere.
That’s quite a dramatic ending! It
sounds like you’ve all been kept
quite busy, so what do you think
the greatest achievements of your
team and of the Cassini team as a
whole so far have been?
Well, to be honest, I think they’re
one and the same! A few years ago, we
discovered water ice on Enceladus,
one of the moons of Saturn.
Obviously I like that discovery
because it involved my team, but it
also made sure that everyone worked
as a group, comparing data sets and
looking at exactly what was going on.
That really is quite an incredible
discovery. So in the next four years,
what new things are you looking to
investigate?
Well, the magnetometer team
really want to model all the different
currents that are flowing in the Saturn
region. We don’t understand the
structure of the planetary field, aren’t
sure why the magnetic dipole axis and
the rotation axis aren’t aligned and
we’d actually like to figure out how
long a day on Saturn is!
What do you mean, figure out how
long a day is?
It’s actually quite hard to figure out
the rotation period for a gas giant like
Saturn! We can’t look at fixed points
on the surface like we do on Earth,
and the atmosphere is obviously not
static.
We try to use radio emissions to
determine day length, timing how
long it takes a particular source of
radio emissions to complete one
rotation.
Unfortunately, the radio signals
from Saturn aren’t constant, they
appear to change with time and
season, making things rather difficult
for us.
I’d never thought about that but it
makes sense. Some of that sounds
like quite a challenge, so what do
you think your biggest task will be
in the coming years?
Well personally my biggest
challenge will be convincing everyone
else to let us roll the spacecraft when
we get closer to the end of the mission.
The zero-level on our instruments
changes, so we need to make sure that
everything is properly calibrated.
We wanted to do this by comparing
the readings from our magnetometer
(built at Imperial) to that built at JPL
