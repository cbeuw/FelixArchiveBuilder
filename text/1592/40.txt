ICRFL Freshers attend invitational
On Saturday 29th
November,
Imperial College Rugby
League took a core of players,
mostly freshers, to Cambridge for a
session hosted by the Green Lions.
The day provided an opportunity for
blooding new players for both sides
in a social environment. ICRFL, keen
for their first run out of the season,
attended in full kit striking fear into
the hearts of the lions.
The day started with a joint training
session, and a Cambridge plot to tire
the IC players with some fitness, but
reserves held and the session moved
to skills based play. Having travelled
with a small squad of players ICRFL
found themselves short a dummy
half and stand-off, but confident of
their passing abilities the positions
were quickly filled by a prop and
second row.
In awe of the accuracy of the
passing skills of ICRFL’s forwards the
Green Lions started the main event, a
9s match. The game featured fantastic
performances from the IC freshers.
New to the sport, and concerned
about the size of the players on the
opposing team, Joe Dai perfected
his sidestep, dancing around some
Cambridge players before scoring an
outstanding individual try. Other
notable performances came from
Andy making some exceptional
supporting runs on our Captain,
while Pavol found his skillset as an
insurmountable defensive mountain.
The day finished with socialising
in the club house, an invitation
to ICRFL for special access to the
Cambridge vs Oxford Varsity, and
Liverpool,
Tiger
Woods and

Column
Liverpool saw their Champions
League dreams end with a 1-1
draw against Basel. Brendan
Rodgers’ team needed to win to
qualify, but will instead have to settle
with the Europa League. Arsenal,
who had already qualified, thumped
Galatasaray 4-1, with Aaron Ramsey
scoring an early contender for goal of
the season. Manchester City qualified
as well, courtesy of a 2-0 win in Rome.
Jenson Button has been awarded
a new contract at McLaren. He will
partner Fernando Alonso next season
while Kevin Magnussen will be the
team’s reserve driver.
England batsman Craig Kieswetter
looks set to miss the 2015 season
after suffering a setback from the eye
injury that he suffered in July. In the
first Australian match since Phillip
Hughes’ death, Michael Clarke, David
Warner and Steve Smith (all former
team mates of Hughes at New South
Wales) scored hundreds as Australia
dominated the first two days against
India. On the third day Indian
captain Virat Kohli was hit flush
on the helmet by a bouncer from
Mitchell Johnson. He recovered to
score a hundred as India mounted a
comeback on day three.
In his first competitive tournament
after a four-month lay-off from
injury, Tiger Woods finished in a tie
for last place. Jordan Spieth won by
10 shots.
A German TV documentary has
alleged that 99% of Russian athletes
are guilty of doping. It has also since
alleged that at least one Briton has
avoided an inquiry, after 150 samples,
marked as “highly suspicious”, were
not investigated.

Kunal Wagle tells Felix about some of the best action over the holiday
Football
Sunday 21st December:
Liverpool vs Arsenal.
Liverpool have had a poor start
to the season, and Arsenal have not
looked secure, despite qualifying for
the last 16 in the Champions League.
Sunday 28th December:
Tottenham v Man Utd.
Right in the middle of the busy
Christmas season, this game will
be important. United are currently
in the Champions League places
but haven’t performed overly
well. Mauricio Pochettino and his
Tottenham side have had a poor start
to the season.
Saturday 3rd January:
FA Cup third round.
Expect numerous ‘cupsets’, as the
Premier League and Championship
teams enter this fabled competition.
Cricket
Tuesday 6th January:
Australia v India.
The third test match in this series is
admittedly also during the holidays
(it starts on Boxing day), but the
Sydney Test match will probably be
an emotional affair. The home state
of Phillip Hughes, who tragically
passed away two weeks ago, will play
host to its first International game
since the fatal accident.

Tennis
Monday 5th January:
The start of the tennis season.
The tennis season begins in
earnest on the 5th January, with
tournaments in China, India, New
Zealand, Brisbane and Qatar. If men’s
tennis is your cup of tea, then turn
your attention to Doha, where the
top players begin warming up for
the Australian Open. The best of the
women’s players will be travelling to
Brisbane, so be sure to take a look at
that as well.
Golf
Thursday 8th January:
USPGA tour begins.
The Hyundai Tournament of
Champions begins in Kapalua, Hawaii
in America on the 8th January. It is
the first tournament of 2015.
