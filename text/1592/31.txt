It’s that time of the term again.
Well, for those of us unfortunate
enough to have end-of-term
exams anyway (e.g. me). As the
days are getting shorter, colder and
revision hours are ticking away like
a time bomb, it’s hard to stay festive
even with Christmas so close.
And for those with beginning of
term exams, a Christmas dinner with
revision at the back of your mind is
probably not what you had in mind
for the holiday spirit.
But don’t worry, we’re all in the
same boat, and here are some tips that
will help you survive the exam stress
this time of the year.
There’s no perfect revision
schedule
By the time you’ve come to
university, you would have realized
that people work best at different
times. But during exam periods, the
constant comparison between you
and the rest of the class can make you
forget that.
Talking to an early bird about her
revision routine doesn’t mean that
you’re starting too late. And that
night owl boasting about his all-
nighter? It doesn’t mean you’re not
working hard enough either.
Everyone has their own
preferences. This includes how often
you take breaks, where you work best,
whether you should suspend your
Facebook account and even should
you should go to a party this evening?
The most important thing is to keep
track of how well you’re covering the
topics. Don’t forget that!
It’s OK to take breaks
It is closely related to the point above
but very important to emphasise,
especially for those preparing to have
a revision-plagued holiday. Taking
breaks or having a trip abroad is
allowed. Diligence may be a virtue
but so is temperance. So don’t be a
Scrooge and do have some fun.
“But there’s so much to revise
and there’s never enough time to
memorise everything!” A particularly
hardworking student might say.
Well, look at it this way. You can’t
overwork yourself and get burnt out,
spending days looking blankly over
your notes. So if you factor in those
breaks into your revision schedule,
you are much more likely to make
sure that you get the most out of the
days you do work. Efficiency is key,
not raw hours dedicated to sitting
down with your books.
For those with exams practically
glaring down their faces, breaks can
mean just an evening to cool off so
that your brain can have some time
to consolidate what it has learned.
A break when you need it will make
sure what you learned stays in your
head and keep you going for the next
round.
People lie
In addition to a cynical truth, it’s also
what people do leading up to exams.
Your course mates, people in the year
above, your sister, your grandpa. If
they said that they have stormed
through 8 hours a day without as
much as a toilet break, they’re most
likely lying to you. It’s a good old
intimidation technique or an attempt
to become ‘holier-than-thou’.
Even if they genuinely believed
that they had been such a staunch
reviser, they probably forget to count
all those moments they were trying
to find the perfect revision playlist,
clearing their head with Candy Crush
or writing an article for the university
newspaper.
This tip also applies to those guys
who lean back on their chairs and
said, “Oh, that exam? I just revised it
the day before. You’d be dumb to fail
it.”
Best bet? Trust yourself to assess
how you’re doing and only take away
what is useful, like the relevance
of that last lecture. Only you know
whether you should spend more or
less time revising.
Take a step back
Tunnel vision is the nemesis of exam
revision. That’s when you judge your
entire academic performance based
on the one single thing you happened
to focus your attention on in your
panic.
No, you’re not going to fail because
you missed all the revision sessions.
No, you’re not a failure if you slept in
today. And no, you won’t be kicked
out of Imperial if you can’t get
yourself to revise today after a long
solid week.
These things aren’t going to make
or break your exams. As long as what
you’re doing is getting you closer to
understanding your subject, it’s better
not to dwell on the details.
Try to look at the wider picture of
how you’re doing overall. What if
instead of attending those revision
sessions, you managed to master a
particularly difficult topic? Don’t let
that one thing pull everything else
down.
Take an even larger step back
Near-spiritual anecdote coming
up. When I was an undergraduate
preparing for my finals, I remember
being so stressed that new veins
started sprouting across my temples.
I was so stressed I don’t think I could
hold a normal conversation anymore.
The evening before my first exam,
I gave up revising. As I hopelessly
procrastinated, I stumbled across
a video about Chris Hadfield, the
Canadian astronaut who did a cover
of ‘Space Oddity’ in space, talking
about earth from the window of the
International Space Station.
He said that every single person
in the history of mankind had lived
and died on that blue globe floating
before him. Once you’ve had that
perspective, the scale of whatever
you face diminishes in comparison.
Insignificance is usually scary, but it’s
exactly what I needed to be reminded
of at that moment.
That reminded me what these
exams really were. Just something
that most people went through
in their lives being as scared and
nervous as I was, and for a great
majority of those people, it went
better than expected.
So if the worst comes to the worst
and you feel truly doomed for the
exam, just remember that exams
don’t determine lives.
You might feel that it does right
now, but your worst case scenario is
not going to happen.
Exams usually end with a huge
sigh of relief and even if it doesn’t,
remember that it’s just a termly exam
and you’ll have plenty of chance to
redeem yourself.
Best of luck!
