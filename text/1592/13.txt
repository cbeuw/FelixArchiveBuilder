Telltale Games have put their
name to another TV franchise
and this time round it is the
giant that is Game of Thrones. For
those not familiar with the Telltale
style, the game is a combination of
point-and-click and quick-time events.
Those wishing to run about Westeros
as Benjen Stark/Daario Naharis
wielding an axe, killing whoever they
please should look away now. But
what the game lacks in exciting play
styles, it makes up completely with an
absorbing and completely interactive
story.
The first episode sees you play as
three different characters, all related
to the House of Forrester. You start
as Gared Tuttle – humble son of a pig
farmer and squire to the noble Lord
Gregor Forrester. Your first mission
is to gather wine to further celebrate
the marriage of Robb Stark (the self-
proclaimed King in the North) and
JeyneWesterling.BookreadersandTV
watchers know what happens next and
you’re stuck in the middle of it. You get
outofthesituationaliveandhavebeen
given the responsibility of taking Lord
Forrester’s sword back to your home
town of Ironrath.
You also get to play as two of Lord
Forrester’s children: Ethan and Mira
Forrester. Ethan is not much more
than a boy back at Ironwrath and Mira
isactingashandmaidenfortheQueen-
to-be Margaery Tyrell. This means
there are three main environments
for you to explore: the road back to
Ironwrath as Gared, the town itself as
Ethan and a small section of the great
King’s Landing.
One of the great things about this
game is that even though ultimately it
may not alter your future, every single
piece of dialogue you select to say
feels like it counts. There is no greater
example of this than the tense public
meeting with the Queen Regent Cersei
Lannister as Mira. As the daughter of
an ex-bannerman of the “traitor” Robb
Stark, you are not exactly in Cersei’s
good books. Margaery even advises
you to say what Cersei wants to hear
instead of what you are thinking. I
kept to her counsel but even so I felt I
was making errors at every turn and
no matter how you start, you will feel
the same (“When you play the game
of thrones, you win or you die” always
looming over you with each click of the
mouse).
The graphics are not state-of-the-art
by any means. I felt there were a lot
of rough edges that could have been
ironed out but this is just nit picking
and it definitely didn’t ruin my
enjoyment of the game.
To appeal to TV-watchers in
particular, the real actors and their
likenesses were used and through the
three different playable characters
you get to meet Cersei and Tyrion
Lannister, Margaery Tyrell and
Ramsay Snow (with the promise of at
least Jon Snow in coming episodes).
This was a major plus for me. Iwan
Recently I was sitting in the Felix
office absentmindedly jingling
the bells (I know sad, right?),
when a fellow section editor sent
me the link to the game Christmas
Shopping Simulator. This immediately
gave me purpose in life, and faster
than a elf can wrap a present I had
clicked on the link to the merriment.
What I found there was about as
much fun as a sack of coal.
In a blatant attempt to advertise
itself, the store GAME has released
this game in a bid to make fun of all
those other quirky little games that
have warmed our hearts like goat
simulator and surgeon simulator.
This is about as cool as the reindeers
making fun of Rudolph for having a
red nose.
Oh well, I thought to myself,
given that it was free and in fact
was Christmas themed, I felt like
I shouldn’t be the Grinch about it.
With an open mind I downloaded
this onto one of the Felix machines
and started shopping away in a
virtual mall.
The game itself was incredibly
simple to use, and I soon got to grips
with it. However, it soon became very
apparent how much this Christmas
Shopping Simulator was ripped off
from Goat Simulator. I mean, rag doll
mode…really?
The control themselves were really
clunky and sometimes I found it
hard to remember how to actually do
things. Furthermore there was the
seemingly useless ability to fart. Yes,
you could actually expel gas (a weird
orange colour!), which served no
other purpose except try and get some
pity laughs out of you.
After I had gotten over the initial
silliness that was the ragdoll mode,
kicking things around and trying to
evade the mall cops I attempted to
actually play this ‘game’. I started
off with the missions, but they were
all pretty repetitive, and the arrow
above my head that showed me where
to go either made it incredibly easy
or confusing as it would point to
inaccessible areas of the map.
The achievements on the other
hand weren’t too bad, and I actually
found achieving most of them quite
enjoyable. Sadly there wasn’t actually
much of them, or content in general.
I think I finished the entire game in
a bit 2 hours, and that includes me
dicking about.
What I have to say is that this game
is actually incredibly broken. I found
several ways to completely crash the
game, get myself stuck in such ways
that I had to restart! Also, the obvious
advertising for GAME was really
jarring and put me off playing a bit.
My advice is for you give this one
a miss. Even if it is free it really isn’t
worth the effort. Just go into a game
store for the same experience, and
you may actually be able to buy a
proper game!
Rheon’s portrayal of Ramsay Snow
is perfect in the TV series and his
performance in the game is no
different. His voice and face could
instil fear into the hardiest of souls and
unlike the TV show, you have to choose
what to say to him (and only the seven
gods know what he’s going to do next).
The game is incredible for creating
impeccable suspense even in some of
the most innocuous of scenes.
Even though I thoroughly enjoyed
this episode and the twists and turns
that unfolded, after a bit of research I
found there was no way to change the
ultimate (and shocking) ending of the
episode.
You are told at the beginning of the
game that every choice you make will
have a significant impact on the events
that unfold.
However, no matter how well or
badly you play the game there is no
escaping what is to come. Of course this
is just a current limitation of game-
making technology. Even having two
or three major endings per episode
would require so many different scenes
to be written and graphically processed
which would just be too expensive.
Gameplay will last about three hours
per episode and considering you get
six of them, I think this sort of game
is great value for £22.99 (currently on
Steam).
What is great about this game is
you don’t have to be a video game fan
or particularly any good at them, all
you need is a love for a good story told
well and if you are a Game of Thrones
fan (and what the hell are you doing if
you’re not?) then this game is definitely
for you.
"If you are
a Game of

fan then
this
game is
definitely
for you."
