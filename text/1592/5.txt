UCL Union has voted to
not reduce the number of
sabbatical officers in a close-
fought debate at a General Assembly
on Tuesday. The motion, which was
voted for by a simple majority of
students, failed to pass as it did not
reach the 75% majority necessary
to modify UCLU’s governing
documents.
A General Assembly is equivalent
to an ICU General Meeting, where
everyone is entitled to vote. Unlike
ICU, UCLU have General Assemblies
fairly regularly. This particular one
was followed by a social.
The motion proposed to cut the
number of sabbatical officers as a
means to cutting UCLU’s deficit,
which is running into the region of
hundreds of thousands of pounds.
The motion in question, called
“Amendment 3” proposed for a
conversion of UCLUs structure
to have six sabbatical officers –
“Activities & Events”, “Ethics,
Proposal to cut 10 sabbaticals down to 6 at UCL falls through
Environment & Operations Officer”,
“Welfare and Communities Officer”,
“BME and International Students
Officer”, “Education, Democracy
& Communications Officer”, and
“Postgraduate Students and Medical
Students Officer”.
The changes were proposed to
save nearly £160,000 in salaries and
associated costs, although costs from
reducing the number of support staff
were not included.
The overall result on the vote
was 304 for, 225 against, and 10
abstentions.
The rejection of the motion has
caused some controversy; with some
complaining that the rejection of the
motion showed that UCLU was “out-
of-touch”. One student vowed that
the campaign to cut the number of
sabs “will be back”.
Following the rejection of the
paper, a motion was passed to
adjourn the meeting. Hannah
Sketchley, the UCLU Democracy
and Communications Officer
described the decision as “unwise
and undemocratic”, with it being
a “massive shame not to hear the
motions of other people who had
worked so hard on their campaigns”.
Because of this, a fourth proposal
by the sabbatical team involving the
removal of one sabbatical officer was
not considered.
Both motions would have increased
the number of executive officers,
similar to ICU’s liberation officers.
One of the changes in Amendment
3 involved the elimination of the
Women’s Officer.
In an article that incumbent Annie
Tidbury wrote for the Telegraph
website, she argued the proposal
ignored the “long-term implications
for students”. The proposals
replace the position with a “Gender
Equalities Officer”.
She noted that her role is “too big a
workload to balance with studying for
a degree”, and that people would lose
the opportunity to “talk to someone
in a position of authority”. According
to the article, in the 17 weeks she has
been in the role, she has had “over 30
students” contact her for advice.
Additionally, in her article she
complained that a gender equalities
officer would be problematic, as
“it would not have to be filled by a
woman.” She contained, “a man may
well be appointed – someone with no
experience of what it’s like to live as a
woman or face misogyny”.
She highlighted the Black and
Minority Ethnics Students’ Officer;
another proposed new position,
as also potentially experiencing a
similar issue.
In conclusion, she said, “When
we’re looking to make savings, why
should it be already marginalised
groups that have to suffer the most?”
However, in an article written
to The Tab London, one of the
proposers of the original motion,
James Simcox, said that an amended
version will be proposed at the next
meeting to rename the proposed
“Gender Equalities Executive Officer”
to “Women’s Executive Officer”,
amongst other changes.
Following the failure for the
proposal to attain 75% of the vote,
it will now be considered at UCLUs
Trustee Board.

After the initial uproar
amongst academics caused
by the publication of Stefan
Grimm’s damning posthumous
email, discussion has spread amongst
academics outside the English-
speaking scientific community.
The biggest response by far has
been seen amongst Chinese-speaking
scientific academics. A number of
mainland Chinese researchers, which
include a mix of those stationed in UK
universities and in Chinese academia,
have discussed the issue at length
on Chinese scientific news website
Sciencenet.cn.
On his personal blog, Zhang-qi Yin,
an academic research fellow at the
Center for Quantum Information
located in Tsinghua University’s
Institute for Interdisciplinary
Information Sciences, mused that “I
believe that this common trend (of
using research grant income as a KPI)
in the West will be picked up by China
very quickly; this gives me a strong
sense of sympathy for my fellow
academics, and dread.”
Several citizens have also voiced
concern about the future of China’s
academic culture, which believe
that research in the West is more
progressive and seeks to emulate their
successes.
The impact, however, goes beyond
that of the blogs hosted on and off the
Sciencenet website.
Solidot, a tech portal set up by
the China branch of international
consumer tech media outlet CNET,
also briefly covered the dcscience.net
blog post.
China is not the only country whose
news and social media portals have
touched the issue. Following a tip-off
from medical student Jesper N. Kjaer
(@jespernkjaer on Twitter), videnskab.
dk in Denmark also published a story
summarizing the coverage from
dcscience.net and the THE.
The virality of the story continues
to grow, with dcscience.net receiving
plenty of pingbacks from users sharing
links to the blog post on Twitter
and via their own blogs. A number
of people have since adopted the
#grimmdeath hashtag while voicing
their thoughts on the issue, the
majority of which have condemned
the general culture of emphasizing
“headline glory via grant input” and
not the quality of output, plus the shift
to a more business/administrative
focus in universities.
While the Higher Education
Funding Council for England
(HEFCE) has wrapped up their formal
consultation for their independent
review on the role of metrics in
assessing research quality, Colquhoun
noted that two members of the
consultation group are aware of the
issue based on Twitter commentary,
and that his open letter to President
Alice Gast has gone unanswered.
He has since strongly pushed for
an independent external inquiry to
be held, citing that “their present
proposal that the people who let things
go so far should investigate themselves
has been greeted with the scepticism
that it so richly deserves. I still live in
hope that someone will be sufficiently
courteous to answer this time.”
It seems the idea of “Publish and
Perish” - the pressures to secure
funding or lose your job, are not
apparently unique to Imperial. It
was also recently reported in the
Independent that Academics at the
University of Warwick have accused
the university of treating them like
“City Traders.” Staff were put on a
risk of redundancy for not bringing
in enough research income, with a
benchmark set for them to reach of
around £90,000.
Anne O’Sullivan, University and
College Union regional official, added:
“Warwick Medical School is at the
forefront of cutting edge research into
life-threatening illnesses, It should
be looking to foster closer links and
develop its expertise, not arbitrarily
axing staff.
“The university’s approach
demonstrates a worrying lack of
understanding about research work
and its funding. We would urge the
university to step back from this
unusual move and reconsider how the
school might be able to meet targets.”
