Can the BAFTAs be a good
prediction for the Oscars?
Despite the rain on February 13th,
Leicester Square was once again a buzz-
ing night of flashbulbs and red carpet
walks as it played host to the 63rd an-
nual BAFTA awards. A semi-reliable
predictor of which way the Oscars might
swing, the BAFTAs has becoming an in-
creasingly high profile event in the film
world, injecting a bit of life and glamour
into the British film scene and bring-
ing big names to the capital. Julianne
Moore, Jessica Alba and Mark Ruffalo,
were among the Hollywood faces who
turned up, but the big winners of the
night were the cast and crew of the re-
cent British hit, The King’s Speech.
A runaway winner, The King’s Speech
took away seven awards, including Best
Film, Best British Film, Best Original
Screenplay, Best LeadingActor (for Col-
in Firth) and both of the Best Supporting
awards for Helena Bonham-Carter and
Geoffrey Rush. Whether or not this suc-
cess will be repeated on the 27th of Feb-
ruary at the Academy Awards remains to
be seen. Though last year’s big winner,
The Hurt Locker, took away Best Film
and Best Director at both the BAFTAs
and the Oscars, the idea of the Academy
giving this many major awards to a Brit-
ish film seems unlikely.
It’s been a good year for cinema, and
one that has left one of the most cele-
brated films of the year, Inception, go-
ing fairly unrecognised in awards season
– it scooped a handful of BAFTAs but
mainly technical awards (Best Sound,
Best Production Design etc.). Up against
four other films from a good year, it’s
even more of an achievement that The
King’s Speech beat Inception, The Social
Network, True Grit and Black Swan to
the title of Best Film.
The Social Network didn’t go com-
pletely unappreciated. David Fincher
picked up Best Director for it, and it also
got a nod in the Best Adapted Screen-
play category, whilst Black Swan re-
ceived recognition by way of Natalie
Portman’s Best Leading Actress award.
A nice touch for British cinema was
Chris Morris’ Best Debut win for Four
Lions. Even though most Chris Morris
fans will have known him for some time
as the creator of Brass-Eye and Nathan
Barley television series, it’s a well-
deserved acknowledgement for one of
the most talented filmmakers in Brit-
ain today. British actor Tom Hardy also
went home with the Orange Rising Star
Award, most likely for his breakthrough
appearance in Inception, though his pre-
vious roles in British films Bronson and
L4yer Cake have definitely made him
worth of this award – definitely more
worthy than last year’s winner Kristen
“Twilight” Stewart.
So how good is this as a predictor
of Oscars? It’d be a big surprise if The
King’s Speech repeated this clean sweep
on the 27th, and after winning Best Lead-
ing Actor last year for A Single Man,

Colin Firth is unlikely to be awarded
it again. Instead, The Social Network’s
Jesse Eisenberg could be in with a better
shot, with films like The Social Network
and The Fighter likely to pick up more
than they did at the BAFTAs. How the
exact breakdown will be at the Academy
Awards, however, is not clear-cut. The
only sure-fire thing to put your money
on is probably the Pixar failsafe option
in the Best Animated Film category with
Toy Story 3.
Blood Ties is a lesson in budget filmmaking

Blood Ties
Saphira Gurski
Surely they’re called “big budget action
flicks” for a reason!? I was initially ex-
cited yet cringing at the thought of re-
viewing an indie action flick. Indie film
virgins like myself need not despair; this
film is not a desperation tune-in to Air
Canada’s In-flight film fest after 10 hours
of inter-continental leg cramps. Blood
Ties will snatch you out of mainstream
cinema drudgery and entice you into the
world of micro-budget film viewing.
Director (and lead actor) Kely Mc-
Clung creates saturated visuals, a
sense of movement and an ethereal
background glow calling to mind the
otherworldly sensation in Nolan films
which drags viewers into the screen
(no 3D glasses required). Luckily, this
gritty dreamscape fabricated in the
back streets of Thailand and Eastern
US doesn’t overshadow the story. Jack
Davis (Director Kely McClung), former
federal agent “G.I. Joe”, discovers his
brother Jim (The Vampire Diaries’ Rob-
ert Pralgo) is kidnapped and flies off to
the danger-filled alleys of Thailand to
secure his freedom. What Jack doesn’t
know is his former shadowy employers
are pulling the strings from the USA.
The film subtly reveals a much deeper,
intriguing tragedy beneath martial arts
action á la Jacky Chan.
The most beautiful yet at brief points
frustrating part of the film is the com-
plexity of storyline and characters
shown without words. In a few scenes
I felt like additional dialogue would’ve
added more depth, but in most, there
was a raw beauty in exploring charac-
ters through expression and reactions
– silent, physical or emotional – you’d
see in real life. Far more satisfying than
dialogue filmed for the sake of exposi-
tion, this drags you into contemplating
everything you see.
Careful casting adds an additional
layer of gritty realism. Average-Joe
Americans are cast as non-descript mili-
tary black-operatives instead of Hol-
lywood beach boys. Thai gang kidnap-
pers convince you they’re a street gang
for hire that took a job on a movie set
as an amusing break from their nightly
prowl. Tuk-Tuks and their drivers were
paid to film a chase scene in Bangkok
traffic and main characters are played
by real-life martial arts experts fighting
with visually exotic techniques you’ve
never seen in a mainstream action flick.
My favourite scene involves Jack and a
Thai girl – who genuinely can’t speak
English – expressing their love for one
another through a very real language
barrier. Blood Ties skips the “acting” of
most films and simply captures beauti-
ful, real moments of interaction between
characters.
Clearly, there’s a reason Blood Ties
has been cleaning up the awards circuit
(Best International Film in UK at the
End of the Pier Int’l Film Festival, Film
of the Year at the Action on Film Festi-
val, etc). Its exotic visuals and martial
arts scenes will get your blood pump-
ing, but its mind-bendingly subtle story
and characters are what will keep this on
your DVD rack for ages!
I’m not sure if ‘bland’ is her colour...
“It captures beauftiful
interactions between
characters.”
