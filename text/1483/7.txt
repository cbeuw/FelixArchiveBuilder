FELIX 7
FEATURE
A
few weeks ago, many peo-
ple were saddened to hear
that Martin Milligan, who
many knew as the man
who sold the Big Issue in
the South Kensington pedestrian tunnel,
had passed away.
People flustered by the morning com-
mute who would usually put their head
down and stride past a homeless per-
son, would stop to talk to Martin, buy a
Big Issue from him, offer him food. He
was part of people’s lives and he will be
missed by many.
In our daily lives it is not uncommon
for us to see rough sleepers around Lon-
don. Even though they are there, many
of us see through them or avert our gaze
when walking past. But the truth is we are
not seeing the bigger problem of home-
lessness; the hidden homeless of London.
According the 1996 Housing Act a
person is classified as homeless when
they have no accommodation that they
are entitled to occupy, or they have ac-
commodation, but it is not reasonable
for them to continue to occupy this ac-
commodation.
Despite not living on the streets,
many people meet the legal definition of
homelessness. These people can spend
their lives bouncing from hostel to hos-
tel, sleeping at Bed and Breakfasts or be
living in overcrowded houses.
Homeless charity Crisis carried out re-
search in 2004 in an attempt to find out
the extent of the homeless problem in
the UK. The figures are staggering.
Around 800,000 people are estimated
to be homeless. Worringly, half of these
people are described as the ‘hidden
homeless’. These people, despite being
technically homeless, have no been pro-
vided with accomadation either because
they are ‘not a priority’ or they have not
been officially classifed as homeless.
This includes people who sleep rough.
Many of the hidden homeless are de-
fined as ‘single homeless people’; this
simply means that they have no children
or dependents, and therefore are not
such a priority to for councils to house.
However, these people are often among
the most vulnerable people in society;
for example, people who have left a
violent partner or those who are dealing
with mental health issues.
Those that can often slip through the
net are the younger generation of home-
less, those under the age of 25, our peers.
How many people have heard of a friend
sofa surfing whilst trying to find a perma-
nent place to stay? Or having to stay with
family temporarily? Well, those friends
are technically homeless. This is a stress-
ful situation that thousands of young men
and women are currently living through.
As far as the government is concerned,
once you’re 18, they are not responsible
for arranging accomadation for you. For
students in this situation, the first port of
call should be the university accomoda-
tion office. After graduating, contacting
the local council is the best way of get-
ting referred to a hostel.
Unfortunately, for many, sleeping on a
mate’s sofa is not an option. The people
sleeping rough in the UK are the most
obvious face of homelessness - the per-
son next to your tube stop who you pass
on your way home every night or the

daily commute.
St Mungo’s deals with those who have
run out of options and find themselves
on the streets. Judith Higgin from the
Trust told us that helping people who
are sleeping rough isn’t just about put-
ting a roof over their heads. “Homeless-
ness isn’t just about housing. It’s about
the situation that leads to it, be that men-
tal health problems, family breakdown,
substance abuse. Those things can spiral
out of control quite quickly.”
Most people who end up in hostels like
this stay for around eighteen months, dur-
ing which time they can get help with ed-
ucation and training that could help them
back on their feet. But many of them also
have mental health problems, which hos-
tels and charities have to tackle.
Data from CHAIN, a database man-
aged by the Broadway Homeslessness
and Support charity, shows that 35%
of London’s rough sleepers have men-
tal health problems. These can be the
cause of people finding themselves on
the streets in the first place. But they can
also be caused by the strains and stresses
of sleeping rough.
Intertwined with this issue is drug and
alcohol abuse, which can be a cause or a
consequence of homelessness.
It’s really easy to become homeless,
but really hard to get out of once you get
there. That’s why charities and hostels
need your support. You can either give
money to charities, or volunteer to help
out at a hostel or soup kitchen.
Imperial student Katy Bettany vol-
unteered with Holy Trinity Brompton
at St Pauls, Onslow Square. She had to
persevere to get through the checks, get-
ting a CRB and a reference from a priest
through her church.
But to her, it was worth it. “Homeless-
ness is something that really upsets me,
so it was nice to be able to do something
tangible to help.”
Although it is easy to paint homeless
people according to a stereotype, Katy
found the people she worked with full of
surprises. ‘One of the guys just sat down
at the piano, and he turned out to be the
most amazing pianist. I just don’t under-
stand how someone that talented ended
up on the streets.’

Lovena Chettiyer shares her
thoughts and memories about
Martin Milligan.
I’ve known Martin for the past
8 years, he was like a father to
me. He was a retired English
and Latin teacher, he was origi-
nally from Edinburgh.
Martin had a caring and kind
nature. He was very thought-
ful and would go out of his
way to help people.Martin was
very much loved by all of us
at Pandora [a designer dress
agency], he was like our agony
uncle.
He was great at giving us
fashion advice as he had a
good eye.
My favourite memory of Mar-
tin was when he spent Christ-
mas with me and a couple of
friends in 2009. We had a de-
lightful evening and shared a
lot jokes, he later went on to
tell everyone that it was one of
the best Christmas he had for
a very long time. He was a bit
dubious about my lamb roast
at the beginning as he never
believed I could cook.
Martin had a very dry and
sarcastic sense of humor.
Pandora will never be the
same without Martin, his ab-
sence is deeply felt by all of
us.
