COMMENT
I
was linked to a post on Politi-
cal Scrapbook this week, a blog
which seems to mostly cover UK
politics from the sort of left–wing
perspective that makes you want
to pat in on the head and pinch its cheek.
The post in question highlighted the gen-
ocide–worthy activities of the York Uni-
versity Young Conservatives (YUYC), a
bunch of incredibly distasteful foetuses
who have taken to the Tory stereotype
like a particularly fascist duck to a pond
full of army uniforms. There were the
usual arse–faced drunk Facebook pho-
tographs, of course. But mixed in with
these were some unbelievable ‘hilari-
ous’posters offering a buffet of horrible,
insulting slogans like a Cadbury’s selec-
tion box of human faeces.
The worst of the lot is the photo of
George Osbourne holding the Budget
aloft with “They See Me Cuttin’, They
Hatin’” written underneath, although the
one with Cameron laughing at people
who will have to pay for their own edu-
cation is pretty bad. You might be happy
for these people to express their political
views as an exercise in Freedom of Ex-
pression, but you’re forgetting that your
Indy Leclerq
opinion is incorrect while mine is quite
the opposite. So be quiet and let me tell
you a thing or two.
Frankly, I could take or leave Political
Scrapbook. I’ve flicked through, and as
they state themselves, it’s mostly gossip
and rumour. Finger–pointing, that kind
of thing. The sort of character–building
stuff that trains up student politicians to
become the self–cleaning cat’s arsehole
they’ve dreamed of being since their A-
Level Politics lessons. But I don’t mind
it because, on the whole, it’s just pok-
ing fun at silly things. If you remove the
silly things from the world of internet
opinion–sharing, you’re left with MyS-
pace. And nobody wants that.
But the YUYC group pisses me off a
little more because it’s just creating a
closed–off social group, and then shit-
ting on those who aren’t within the cir-
cle. I don’t do politics because it bores
me witless and because there are few
genuine debates nowadays, but no mat-
ter what sphere of human smuggery you
try to engage in, be it academia, gov-
ernment or otherwise, there are always
those eager to divide people up and em-
phasise difference.
My position works because I don’t dif-
ferentiate – I have a badge with words
on to that effect; I simply hate everyone.
The alternative is to try to like every-
one. Elizabeth Lesser is a cofounder of
America’s Omega Institute, dedicated
to adult education. She gave a TED talk
about the benefit of taking someone
you disagree with to lunch. It’s a good
talk, you should watch it, but the take–
home message was that divisions gener-
ally don’t help people. We end up in the
state we are politically – a state where
we don’t want to discuss the issues, and
instead governments fight on public im-
age, pandering to large demographics,
and bullshit.
Now for all you care, I think Elizabeth
Lesser is a hack. Because my position
is that you can all go fuck yourselves.
More to the point, I’d rather tear apart
and devour the chargrilled carcasses of
the YUYC than take them out to lunch
and understand them. But that doesn’t
mean you should. So be sure not to let
us ever get as hate–filled and feckless
as York University, and be sure to invite
the Tories the next time you make din-
ner plans.
P
icture the scene: the Olym-
pic Stadium, East London,
less than a year and a half
from now, on a balmy Au-
gust evening. There is little
wind; the heat is slowly rising from the
track. The atmosphere is heavy, but that
has little to do with the weather. The en-
tire world’s gaze is fixed upon the ten
men at one end of the track. Never be-
fore has one event monopolised the at-
tention of so many people. Cameras are
everywhere, and for the first time, peo-
ple are watching in 3D.
The Olympics website is riding a
humongous wave of tweets, as people
voice their support for the athletes. Se-
lected 140–character cheers are beamed
across screens in the stadium. The or-
ganisers have pulled off the first Olym-
pics 2.0, they say; the public is closer
than ever to the action. Or are they?
While the London games next year
will no doubt be a logistical and techno-
logical masterclass, I can only hope that
the organisers achieve one of the most
important aspects: getting the people
into the venues.
There are 8.8 million tickets going
on sale in less than a month, for 645
events in 26 different sports. So far, so
good, you might think. However, almost
ten percent of the tickets will cost over
Angry Geek
£100, which makes the London games
the most expensive in history. Here’s
to the corporate fat cats in their boxes,
then. Never mind, that leaves seven–odd
million tickets for the rest of us, no?
I’m afraid you’re going to have to
start saving up, though. With the new
tuition fees, (big up to Imperial for al-
ways being a pioneer, by the way – we
set the bar in fees as well as academic
standards) spending fifty quid on an
Olympics ticket isn’t going to be part of
most students’ summer plans in 2012.
Incidentally, despite all the proclaimed
efforts at price reduction and special
schemes for various parts of the popula-
tion, as students we’re going to have to
cough up in full to get into any venues.
And most finals or medal ceremonies
start at, you guessed it, £50.
It’s not all bad news, though. The
ballot system put in place by Lord Coe
means that obtaining a ticket will not de-
pend on your internet speed or willing-
ness to queue (and it’s all about fair play
in the first place, isn’t it?)
As I mentioned before, there are twen-
ty-six sports being played at the next
Olympics. While the big draws such as
athletics and cycling will be difficult to
get a seat for (not to mention pricey),
the other 23 disciplines are no less ex-
citing. The athletes are just as passion-
ate, and in many cases have a tougher
time of getting to the Games. However,
due to lower public interest seats will
be cheaper and easier to acquire – sud-
denly, watching canoeing or shooting
becomes a no–brainer.
As a fencer I feel very strongly about
this; many sports only come into the
spotlight every four years despite the
fact that they could appeal to a much
wider audience. This is where uni-
versity (especially Imperial) comes in
handy. Considering the absolute moun-
tain of clubs and societies we have, I’m
sure you could find one for any Olympic
sport (and if not, look into it and start
one yourself!). Try something you’d
only ever seen on TV one summer. I’m
sure you’ll enjoy it – and you’ll be able
to appreciate it being played at the high-
est level next year.
I’m incredibly excited about the
Olympics coming to London, and sports
fan or no, I think you should be too. For
two weeks, our city is going to be the
centre of the world, and we get to wit-
ness some of the greatest feats of human
achievement ever seen. Success stories,
bitter heartbreak; it’s going to be an im-
mense spectacle from start to finish.
For my part, I’m going to go to as much
fencing as I can. Tickets start at twenty
quid – why don’t you come along?
Give viewers a sporting chance
“My position works
bcause I don’t
differentiate; I simply
hate everyone.”
Don’t be afraid to
ask for help
I can’t stand intolerant people
Everybody has a coping mecha-
nism; a way to ensure their
heads don’t explode from
stress, annoyance or the gener-
al tedium of life. My own takes
the form of cooking; every revi-
sion period you can guarantee
a minimum of 5 three-course
meals and a couple of home
recipe cakes.
The result of this habit is
that I tend to carry my stress
around with me, though less
in its “emotional” form and
more as a rapidly expanding
waistline.
For my friends, this method
of de–stressing seems weird.
Sarah, who I have known
since High School, turns her
stress into jet fuel. “If I’m not
stressed, I’m not working,” she
would continually remind me.
The story is less true for two
of my other friends from home.
One has become as close to
an alcoholic recluse as anyone
who regularly attends lectures
can. The other found that pain
distracted her best, and still
bears those scars today.
As you can imagine, I advo-
cate no method I have men-
tioned as a way to cope. My
own – stuffing your face with
fatty food – is not a good way
to stay healthy. Pretending that
you like stress inevitably fails (I
still recall Sarah throwing pot-
tery at me) and drinking heav-
ily can lead to a stage where
its difficult to distinguish be-
tween “just a good time” and
alcoholic.
What is often worse about
stress and general welfare is-
sues is that we hide behind
this fog of “everything is ok” or
“I’m OK on my own.” Though
it’s not weak to ask for help,
people often perceive this to
be the case.
As the president of a Faculty
Union I often feel this is a flaw
we as students have. We are
all happy to say that lecture X
was crap because lecturer Y
just read the PowerPoint slides
but not to approach someone
for guidance and advice.
If you are one of the latter
people (and yes, sadly this is
a plug) do try to visit the RCSU
Welfare Week across campus.
And if that is a little too brave,
email your Faculty Welfare Of-
ficer, the relevant Sabb or your
Personal Tutor – there’s a lot of
support out there.
