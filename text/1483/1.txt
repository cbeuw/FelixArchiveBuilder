This week, Kendall revealed his sup-
port for higher fees in an interview with
Felix: “Courses do cost money and the
courses at Imperial are especially expen-
sive. By increasing the fees to £9,000,
those from lower income will have a
much greater bursary scheme available
to them, and it’s quite exciting how
much bigger this will be. Unfortunately
there can’t be any announcements until
the government specifies its require-
ments on access.”
Imperial is yet to reach an agreement
with the Office for Fair Access as to how
less economically able students will be
funded, with one potential option being
fee waivers for the poorest students – at
the expense of cash bursaries. A propos-
al previously submitted by Cambridge
University outlined plans to charge the
maximum £9,000, giving financially
disadvantaged students a discount of
£3,000 – with a reduction in the maxi-
mum bursary from £3,400 to £1,625.
The proposal was opposed by the Cam-
bridge University Students’ Union who
said that the only way to ensure access
“is a substantial maintenance bursary”.
Alex Kendall made similar comments
and noted that as someone who had
received a full bursary for his time at
Imperial, he had found that “the diffi-
culty in coming to Imperial was the liv-
ing costs – and for that you need cash
in hand. That’s extremely important for
widening access”. He also highlighted
the lack of awareness surrounding bur-
saries, and the need for Imperial to ad-
vertise what bursaries are available be-
fore people apply: “I don’t think people
have a clue about the bursaries on offer
until they arrive here by which point it’s
too late to widen access.” Kendall con-

Imperial College has this week revealed
that it plans to charge the maximum
£9,000 tuition fee rate for 2012 entry.
The move is an unsurprising one, with
the universities of Cambridge and Ox-
ford signalling earlier this month that
higher fees would be necessary to fill a
deficit created by government cuts. Im-
perial is currently the only university in
the UK to have formally announced its
intentions.
The decision was announced in a mes-
sage to staff on Monday by Rector Sir
Keith O’Nions, who said: “To maintain
the excellence of the education we pro-
vide to students it is our intention, sub-
ject to agreement by the Office for Fair
Access, to set fees at £9,000 for Home
and European Union students for 2012
entry.” Government budget cuts have
been a major factor for universities
moving towards higher fees – Oxford
University, whilst having made no for-
mal decisions about tuition fees, has said
that fees of £8,000 would be necessary
to replace the budget cuts and maintain
teaching standards.
With the increase in fees there is the
legitimate fear of excluding individuals
from deprived backgrounds. To ensure
equal access, the ‘Student Fees and Fi-
nancial Aid Working Group’ has been
looking at two models. Imperial College
Union President Alex Kendall explained
earlier this month that Imperial could
either charge £6,000 tuition fees for ev-
eryone – with significant reductions in
financial aid – or a “£9,000 fee so that
those with a large household income pay
and everyone whose family earns below
£60,000 gets some form of subsidy”.
