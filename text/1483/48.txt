Imperial took a squad of seven to Edgbaston, Bir-
mingham on Sunday with genuine hopes of pro-
gressing from the semi-final of the BUCS men’s
indoor tournament, despite a tough draw of Lough-
borough and Coventry Universities.
Having been asked to bat, it soon became ap-
parent that it was going to be a tough day for the
cricket club’s finest against a well drilled Lough-
borough side. Viran Parmar showed great touch at
the top of the order but his opening partner James
Musgrave went just as a promising start was beck-
oning. A constant loss of wickets left the captain,
Matt Tarr, isolated towards the end of the innings
and despite his excellent lower order hitting he was
running out of partners. Imperial struggled to 71
all out, generally considered well below par in the
indoor format.
Imperial needed early wickets and the opening
bowlers, Parmar and Navin Surtani, started with
superb spells but the necessary wickets didn’t
come quick and as the batsmen began to find their
feet, they set about knocking off the total. Ahsaan
Ismail did make a breakthrough, but the runs on the
board were not sufficient to sustain pressure and
Loughborough made it home.
It meant Imperial needed to beat Coventry to
have any hope of making the Cardiff final, so the
squad went searching for inspiration in Birming-
ham. It turned out the gloomy surroundings did
nothing for the cricketer’s chances.
Again inserted Imperial had their batting line up
strengthened by the addition of Iain Stobbs and
knew more runs would be needed. Early wickets
