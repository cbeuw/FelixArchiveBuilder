Considering the 06:00 start, Imperial
Judo were in high spirits as they trekked
to the edges of civilisation in the wilder-
ness of Uxbridge for this year’s London
Senior Universities Judo Open, the big-
gest competition of the year so far. We
hurried down the steps to Brunel yester-
day to meet a very nervous coach who
informed us we had four minutes to get
weighed-in, the guys and girls hurried
onto the scales to see if the morning ab-
lutions had shaved off half a kilo.
Thrust onto the mat in front of a size-
able crowd (sadly missing some cheer-
leaders), Imperial displayed some great
technique and caused real problems for
the competition starting with the best
Judo of the day from James Ko (U66kg)
who solidly beat all 5 of his opponents
and claimed gold without seeming to
break a sweat?! Nikola (U90kg), on the
other hand, decided throws weren’t his
style and promptly threw the rules of
judo out of the window. Instead of the
tradition turn in and throw Nik pulled
his opponent to the ground and forced
them into an armlock Not exactly classy
but a bronze medal is a bronze medal.
In between the two were an impres-
sive collection of two-handed hips
throws, drop throws and foot sweeps
and a case of a particular person losing
a match through falling over their own
feet. Imperial dominated both men’s and
women’s with Alice (U57kg) winning
gold even though it was her first com-
petition.
The black belts faced some incredibly
Jake Woods tough opposition against people with
various things written on their back,
worrying things like GBR and WALES.
Karl (U81kg) was unlucky losing both
his fights to two of the best in the com-
petition but Matt and Ed fought some
heroic battles both losing only to the
eventual winner and had to settle for
bronze and silver. Marie (U63kg) fought
hard but unfortunately lost in the final
and took home the silver.
So when the final medals were dished
out Imperial came home with an impres-
sive two gold, two silver and five bronze
medals (for Jake, Stefano, Bronwyn, Joe
and Nik) and second in the competition
overall. A great performance all round
with some huge throws from everyone,
not bad for a day’s work as everyone
looks forward to BUCS.
