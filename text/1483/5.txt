IT BEGINS
MONDAY 28th
DAILY FELIX
THE
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
The Daily is almost here. 24 pages of your favourite sections
every single day (except Arts, Music, Science and Technology
– see below). Help us report the news by emailing us about
events, meetings and suspicious goings-on around campus.
ARTS
The ﬁrst day of this fool-
hardy escapade. Weʼll
have a 6-page Arts section
pullout with all the happen-
ings from Artsfest as well as
reviews of some of the hot-
test exhibitions in the capi-
tal. Additionally weʼll have
comprehensive reporting
from the Royal School of
Minesʼ Bottle Match.
MUSIC
Day 2. Hopefully, by this
point weʼll either be terribly
excited about how well itʼs
all going (ﬁngers crossed).
Weʼll be publishing a bo-
nanza of reviews, inter-
views and musical opinion.
If that doesnʼt ﬂoat your
boat, donʼt forget that weʼll
have a page of Puzzles in
every issue.
SCIENCE
The half-way point. By now
things will have really got
tough and your Facebook
feed will be full of messag-
es begging for some news
to happen. After two days
without Science, weʼll be
publishing a 6-page pullout
featuring the best the Sci-
ence section has to offer.
Donʼt miss it!
TECHNOLOGY
Almost there. By Day 4 the
elections will have got into
full swing and will, hope-
fully, have descended into
farce. As well as that and
reporting from RAG week,
the Technology section will
make a stupendous come-
back with a 6-page pullout
(are you noticing a pat-
tern?)
VARSITY
The last day. Weʼll be look-
ing back at the week, con-
tinuing our coverage of the
sabbatical elections, includ-
ing manifestos, and also
looking forward to Varsity.
If weʼre still standing, weʼll
be in the Union, either
drowning our sorrows or,
hopefully, celebrating pull-
ing this thing off.
