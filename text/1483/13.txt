Imperial science blog star up for award
D
avid Robertson is the small
town blogger done good. In
only 2 years he has converted
his own little personal website into
one of the globe’s most eminent sci-
ence blogs (davidpj.wordpress.com).
Just this month, it has been nominat-
ed for the 2011 Weblog Awards Best
Science Blog. Felix Science caught up
with the web celebrity to discuss blog-
ging, science, and blatant self promo-
tion.
Could you say a little about your
background?
I’m originally from Australia, where I
did an Environmental Science degree
on the sunny Gold Coast. After my de-
gree I stayed on to do a few years of re-
search, but started to feel a bit trapped
in the university grind. I took on a
couple of extra part-time roles with sci-
ence outreach organisations, and really
enjoyed them. With a real desire to see
more of the world, I decided to move
to London and study science commu-
nication!
When did you start, and why did you
start blogging?
I started blogging early in 2009. I’d
recently started photography and also
knew that I wanted an outlet to express
myself more, and a blog was an obvious
choice. It was a bit of fun at first, a place
to rant and put up stories about surf trips
and the like.
What do you write about on your blog?
Whatever I like! It reflects a lot of what I
do in my life, so it’s got science, photog-
raphy, music, surf, random videos and
links that I like and stories from what
I’ve been doing. Lately there’s been
more science and definitely less surf!
How has your blogging style changed
over time?
If anything, it changes to reflect what
I’m doing at the time. So, while I was
working in Australia, it was about
weekend trips and concerts and stuff.
Then, when I went on a big road trip
and followed it up to my move to Lon-
don, it turned into a travel log; and
most recently, it’s morphing more into
a science theme, because that’s what
I’m studying!
Do you think we need specialist sci-
ence communicators, such as your-
self, or is it something that scientists
themselves should be doing?
That’s a really good question! If I didn’t
think it was worthwhile, I wouldn’t be
doing the course, so I’m probably not
the most objective person to ask.
I think that science communicators
take some of the pressure off scientists;
while it’s important, not everyone who
does research has a flair for publicity,
and science communicators can help to
share new knowledge. However, I also
think science has a big aesthetic dimen-
sion. It’s not just about scientists tell-
ing people about their work, but about
enjoying the discovery, the beauty of
scientific explanations and uncovering
the interesting stories that surround the
doing of science. That’s where science
communicators can find a niche.
Why do you think academics aren’t
blogging more?
I think that, in certain fields, they actual-
ly are! If you look into the world of sci-
ence blogs, many disciplines have quite
prominent representatives. Obviously
there aren’t thousands of blogs about
each subject, but if you have a research
area, you can probably find an academic
who blogs about it. However, it is quite
time consuming and can also be very
personal; not everyone has the desire or
the motivation to share their research or
thoughts online.
What do you think the role of the in-
ternet is in the future of science com-
munication?
I think it’s already quite immense. While
scientific publication is still, largely, in
the paper-based model, research blog-
ging and critique are already changing
how the scientific world deals with im-
portant new results. It is a new, diverse
medium which incorporates elements
of everything that has come before: im-
ages, videos, text and sound, with a huge
extra element of interactivity.
However, it also has pitfalls: it’s easy
to find any opinion online, and some-
times it’s hard to know which sites and
sources to trust, both on science or any
issue.
Why do you think your blog has be-
come so successful?
It’s not that successful yet! I think it’s
having a diversity of content and a fairly
I
mperial’s David Robertson-
might be up for a Bloggie, but
what about the rest of us? It
might not be something you’ve
thought about, but science
blogging is an activity that could be
worth considering. And with funding
tighter than ever, it might be time to
start fleshing out that CV and publi-
cations list with some extras.
A blog may seem like an attrac-
tive option. You get to share some
of your interest in science with the
wider world, connect with other sci-
entists, and (most importantly) it
can be done from the comfort of
your sofa. If you get good you may
even be given the opportunity to join
one of the many new, emerging net-
works of science blogs run by more
traditional media outlets like the
Guardian or Wired Magazine. But it
may be worth thinking twice before
registering that domain name.
As a student, blogging can be a
good way to make sure you’ve re-
ally learnt the material. As an aca-
demic, it can be a way to make new
connections and explore areas of
science outside your almost cer-
tainly narrow specialism. But there
are some pitfalls, and you need to
make sure you don’t fall into them.
Professor Henry Rzepa, of the
Chemistry Department at Imperial,
started his blog three years ago
and treats it as a “research note-
book”. Some of his blog posts have
even turned into research
projects, which in turn have
been published in high pro-
file peer review journals.
Rzepa sees his blog as
part of his “brand” as a scien-
tist, although stresses that he
tries to keep it quite light-hearted
and entertaining, writing in a style
that is very different to a traditional
scientific paper. It’s also given him
a chance to “hop across subject
bounds” into areas he wouldn’t
have otherwise considered.
However, Rzepa was already an
established name within the re-
search community when he started
blogging. For a younger scientist,
forever chasing positions and fund-
ing, he admits that the story might
be a little different.
You need to strike a balance:
blogs often have a personal slant,
and tend to feel much less for-
mal than more traditional media.
But it’s possible to go too far. It’s
generally not a good idea to use
your blog to complain about your
lab mates or latest experimental
failure. As a young scientist, you
never know who you might need
to depend on for help as you scale
the academic career ladder, or
who might look at your blog in
future years when you’re ap-
plying for jobs. Rzepa says
he never publishes any-
thing on his blog that can’t be
backed up with evidence.
As long as you can refrain from
ranting, the benefits can be worth
the time. And it will be your own
time you spend on it.
Professor Andrew Jaffe, of the
Physics Department at Imperial,
said that a blog is generally seen
in a positive light, but only if it’s
done after hours and doesn’t take
away significantly from real re-
search. “Funding agencies want to
have their cake and eat it too; the
ideal is for [blogging] to be a high
quality hobby”.
Jaffe believes, and I’m sure most
scientists would agree, that qual-
ity and quantity of research is the
most important thing for a scien-
tist early on in their career. As time
goes on, and you’ve gained ap-
proval from your peers, there may
be more time to spend on “extras”
such as blogs and other outreach.
So, blogs can be rewarding if you
do them right. They can lead to new
research interests and collabora-
tions, or even just be an outlet for
writing talent that isn’t fulfilled by
writing those endless academic pa-
pers. But if you’re just looking for
somewhere to rant, you’ll need to
find a good pseudonym.

easygoing approach. I like my blog to be
accessible and fun to read wherever pos-
sible, and that makes it easy for people
to return to.
What’s the future for you and your
blog?
Me? I wish I knew! I’d like to pursue
outreach and engagement in science, or
perhaps policy, depending on the op-
portunities I get. The blog will no doubt
keep ticking over; it seems to have a bit
of a life of its own!
