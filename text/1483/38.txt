Attention Imperial...
Would all the men reading this (that’s
a large portion of you) just silently nod
if you find it embarrassing to buy con-
doms? You didn’t nod. I don’t care if
you’re in the library reading this with a
friend opposite you. I bet you still take a
few glances at the girl over there when
you think no one notices. They do, and
it’s a bit creepy. She wants you to stop,
as she has to pretend to be very inter-
ested in her food to avoid eye contact.
See, that’s how embarrassed you are,
you forced me off topic to try to avoid
the shame. Back to the question posed,
nod if you are. Yeah I thought so, you’re
nodding aren’t you. This is a universal
truth it seems. It’s like Newton’s three
laws but a fuck of a lot more fundamen-
tal. I bet you do all the tricks. Only get
them free from the health centre – al-
though even then you feel uneasy, but
don’t worry you can just put down a
friends name. When you buy them you
go and put a whole bunch of other crap
in with it don’t you. ‘Hey person work-
ing at Sainsbury’s I’m here to buy some
items. I’m here to get 3 bottles of wa-
ter, 4 snickers and a pack of crisps. Oh
condoms, ooops, well I guess I’ll just
have to pay for them as well.’ Doesn’t
work at all. In this case homeopathy is
correct. The more you try and dilute the
condoms, the more powerful it becomes
when the real reason for this shop is
revealed.
It is a minefield though. No matter
what you do it could have negative con-
notations. Here is a quick run through:
Normal – you’re boring.
Flavoured – well it’s not the subtlest
way to ask for a blow is it.
Thick – you either need the padding
or maybe you need the desensitising
(apparently it has that effect).
Thin – you are selfish.
Ribbed – you need a little extra help.
Extra large – No-one’s convinced...
I would also like to say to the man look-
ing at the various types of condoms of
offer. When someone walks by don’t
pick up the extra large in a showy
way and make off as if to go and pay
for them. You are not fooling anyone.
Everyone in the shop is a stranger. For
arguments’ sake let’s say the best-case
scenario happens. A woman sees you
getting extra large and is instantly in-
fatuated. She immediately drags you
home for passionate ecstasy. Then all is
revealed and you end up getting noth-
ing but laughed at while looking like a
frankfurter in a parachute.
Men hate this certain purchase so
much that we have invented, and made

riddance
widespread use of, an entire machine to
help us have no human interaction. The
Sainsbury’s self check out. I don’t want
to know what it’s like to work at Sains-
bury’s and I doubt anyone else does so
therefore this must be why it was made.
This is how extreme the lengths are that
we will go to.
The thing is – it makes no sense for
men to be embarrassed. Let me reiterate
why they are embarrassed. They don’t
want to be seen buying something that
implies they are about to have sex in the
near future. Men don’t want people to
think they are having sex. Yeah. Men.
You know, that gender that is world re-
nowned for its hard earned reputation of
modesty about sexual prowess. The gen-
der that hates bragging about any sexual
conquests. I bet if I asked you right now
“Why are you embarrassed about buy-
ing condoms,” your reply wouldn’t be
“Well you know, I wouldn’t want people
to think I’m getting laid. That would be
awful.” I think the US rapper Cam’Ron
sums up men’s attitude perfectly in his
song ‘Hey Ma.’ Let me set the scene.
Cam’Ron has just had sex with a wom-
an. She is still, possibly, lying next to
him. The next part of the song describ-
ing his actions goes as follows:
Cam’ron: Now I’m flipping the cell,
that’s right, I had to call up L. Yo L.
L: What up?
Cam’ron: I hit.
L: What else?
Cam’ron: Plus dome.
L: Say word.
Cam’ron: (Breaks out into song)
And we got it on tonight.
See, his first reaction was to tell some-
one about it. Ignoring the fact that it’s a
bit lame to do that, you can see he wants
people to know. Although it is likely that
he misrepresented that conversation a
bit. I bet it really went like this:
Cam’ron: “Yo L … L! I HAD SEX!
LIKE 30 SECONDS AGO! IT WAS
AWESOME!”
L: “It’s 3 in the fucking morning you
fucking arsehole. Stop calling me every
time you get some. If you don’t I’ll stop
buying those condoms you can’t psyche
yourself up to buy.”
I’m not like most guys. I relish the op-
portunity. I’ll tell you the scene I want to
take place. I walk in and stride over to
the condoms. Pick up a pack and place
it on the self checkout. A siren goes off.
‘Man expecting to have sex in the near
future detected,’ is the announcement.
Then smoke starts shooting out of the
machine. An awe inspiring power bal-
lad plays as I swagger out, condoms in
pocket, ripping open my shirt to reveal
the iconic Superman ‘S.’ That’s how I
want that shit to go down. Maybe you
disagree, I don’t know.
