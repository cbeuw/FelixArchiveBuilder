Taking your pick of Picocon
This weekend is Imperial’s 28th annual Sci-fi convention Picocon. Sci-fi fan Maciej
Matuszewski gives a flavour of the talents of three of the authors attending
I
prefer science fiction to fantasy
and so approached this novel with
some apprehension and reluc-
tance. It follows Livak, a thief and
gambler, who becomes embroiled in an
attempt by a group of wizards to dis-
cover a lost form of magic, but which
eventually leads them to find a deadly
new enemy.
Initially I found there was very little
that was remarkable about this book
but it was not long before I began to
realise that I was starting to care for the
characters. They are varied, interesting,
often morally ambiguous and mostly
very likable. From Livak herself, never
failing to do the right thing, to Darni,
often gruff yet ultimately kind-hearted
and a good friend. They draw the reader
into the story, which also leaves very
little to be desired. It quickly picks up
the pace and is full of excitement and
intrigue.
One of McKenna’s greatest achieve-
ments in this novel is the setting, the
world of Einarinn. It is a detailed, com-
plex place, with a fully fleshed out his-
tory and many distinct and interesting
countries. It is further explored in McK-
enna’s many other books, to which “The
Thief’s Gamble” is a perfect introduc-
tion.
T
his is the first book in a long
time that I simply couldn’t put
down. It is set in an alternate
reality where, in the 60s, the
USA discovered the means to travel to
other parallel universes.
For many years that America’s ver-
sion of the CIA had been sending agents
to ‘improve’ the governments of other
Americas, a policy which is stopped
by the election of a new president. One
retired agent, however, is forced out of
retirement to help capture one of his for-
mer colleagues, who has gone on an un-
explained killing spree across a number
of universes.
The story here is simply brilliant. The
mystery is truly intriguing and you are
never quite sure of the characters’ moti-
vations until the very end. Many of the
plot twists caught me completely off-
guard and by surprise; none felt at all
contrived.
The plot might become slightly too
convoluted for some tastes in the sec-
ond half but for me it just served to
add depth to the story. Those who stick
with the book will be rewarded with
an ending that, while in keeping with
the somewhat ambiguous tone of the
preceding chapters, still manages to be
deeply satisfying.
K
ari Sperring’s debut novel
concerns the planned de-
struction of the city of
Merafi by its enemies
through the use of magic, an art that has
long been forgotten there.
A fascinating examination of a society
almost being brought to its knees by the
unknown it features a disparate cast of
characters whose different plot threads
are masterfully brought together by the
author. Sperring’s experience as a me-
diaeval historian shines through as she
has managed to create a world which
feels very real, which is a major failing
of many other fantasy writers.
The novel is somewhat slow paced
but that just allows for a closer look at
the issues involved, and for the charac-
ters to be given opportunity to develop,
giving the relatively simple storyline
great depth. The plot feels both epic and
personally linked with each of these
characters and this leads to a deeply
poignant ending with a spectacular and
climactic feel. It certainly deserves to
have won the British Fantasy Society’s
Sydney J Bounds Award for Best New-
comer.
Picocon will be held at the Union on
Saturday 19th from 10am, £8
Y
ikes, despite the title, I
didn’t exactly realise
that this was going
to be exactly what it
says on the tin. Eve
Ensler’s all female and always con-
troversial The Vagina Monologues
saw an adaptation by DramSoc on
three nights last week as part of
SHAG Week events, and the taboo
busting subject matter had me
shifting uncomfortably in my
seat.
Well, to begin with at least.
While I might have remained
a little stony faced in the
beginning, fantastic per-
formances from a more
than able cast pulled me
straight in and made me
listen to what had to
be said, raising down-
right belly laughs
from me by the end.
The comfort and ease with which
the cast treated their material (which
some would call offensive) certainly
jarred at the start, but once things in-
variably settled down and showed off
a tremendous range of individual
performances and stories, I could
certainly appreciate the last-
ing appeal of the play, and
the joy of the Dramsoc
cast and crew in the
creation of their
own take on the
production. The
performance itself
hinged around
cast members tak-
ing to the stage
and giving a
monologue on a
varied range of
topics, written
by Ensler (pictured) from amalgama-
tions of personal interviews with around
200 women. The breadth and mixture of
subject matter, ranging from light heart-
ed yet detailed tales of birth, to truly
grim stories of horrendous female abuse
in Bosnia surprisingly worked despite
the grand shifts in tone.
The performance was bolstered by an
exceptional cast who really gave it their
all, fully embodying the characters they
were representing, from elderly women
to loud and proud sex workers. By the
end of the latter’s monologue, the audi-
ence was riotous with the sheer audacity
of it all.
Whether I agreed with the overall
message of each monologue on offer or
not, each was performed admirably and
allowed for some serious thought of the
ramification behind the role of language,
perception and awareness of gender. A
sure fire hit, then.
