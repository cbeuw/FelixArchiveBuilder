About College
Now for something completely different...
Here, to relieve the tedium and
drudgery of normal college life, is
RAG. RAG is about having a laugh
and raising loads of money for
charity at the same time. But
what's more is anybody can get
involved and it costs you nothing.
Tiddlywinks
Saturday 8th October
Yep, it's that time of year again
when hundreds of crazy students,
armed with RAG cans and
tiddlywinks, set off down Oxford
Street.
Tiddling under feet, round
lamp posts, on buses and amazing
tourists into handing over loads of
money. Follow this with a Ring-a-
Ring-a-Roses around Eros and to
round of the day an attempt to
drink a pub dry. This year there
will be oodles of prizes for the top
collectors as well as our usual
incentives (see below). So this
Saturday, whatever the weather,
and no matter how bad your
hangover, make sure you're
tiddlying your wink.
Live Monopoly
Saturday 15th October
The second event, of term will see
you joining thousands of students
from all over the country out on
the streets of London. You have
the unique opportunity to play the
classic board game on the largest
board in the UK Get together a
team of four to six friends and run
round London trying to visit all
the places on the board, answer
the clues, and collect treasure
whilst avoiding the roaming jail
van. In the evening, Mencap will
be throwing a free party for
collectors where they will be
handing out stacks of prizes. So if
you fancy winning a skiing
holiday in Andorra then this is the
event for you.
Rag week
Starts 16th November
This starts with the beer festival
which is the largest of its kind in
Britain. It is followed by two
enormous parties (Freshers week
style), a slave auction, hit squads,
the infamous sponsored nude
kamikaze parachute jump and
much, much more. The Beer
festival sees the launch of the
infamous Rag Mag, which has to
be read to be believed.
Concerts and football
During the year we have many
collections at, big concerts and
football matches, and after
collecting our collectors usually get.
too see the match or show for free.
Last year these included UB40,
Carter U.S.M, Newman and
Baddiel and England v Denmark.
Incentives
Each year we run an incentive
scheme based on how much you
raise throughout the year this year
the incentives are...£50 a mug,
£150 a T-shirt, and other
incentives for higher totals, such
as an engraved tankard.
