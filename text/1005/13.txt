Ta-dah! The new FELIX letters page! (Now all we need are some letters...)
of justice being forced upon the
stout oyster farmers of Orkney by
this blatantly anti-mollusc inclined
Tory 'Government'.
With this in mind I would
suggest that you: (circle)
a) slap yourself on the back and
enjoy the double chocolate gateau
enclosed with this letter,
b) take a leaf out of Lord Lucan's
book,
c) pledge your life (and cash) to us
and our god will do things for you,
d) devote the next issue to a
microscopic account of the exploits
of our last trip to the tandoori,
e) advise your readers to boycott
all oysters being shipped in (at an
exorbitant price) to feed not your
face but the overflowing coffers of
the Tory barons.
Poor
Aftertaste?
Dear F E L I X ,
Are we the only ones confused
about the article in the handbook
'a week and beyond' called 'into
the frying pan'? Under the guise of
a proper restaurant review the
anonymous author appears to
have TOTALLY FABRICATED all
his/her facts. In particular, the
Stockpot have never sold rolly-
polly pudding, there are no steps
at the Paper Tiger, the Kwality
Tandoori was not closed over the
summer and the statue in the
Daquise's is not that of Gertie
Kurokkuski but his brother Oskar. I
think that this behaviour is utterly
disgusting and indeed contravenes
the five articles of the professional
restaurant critics' code. The public
should be warned.

Dear F E L I X ,
It is with the greatest pleasure
that I hear you have managed to
retain the services of that most
cultured and erudite of classical
music commentators, Patrick
Wood. In his single-handed
attempt to expand the pitiful
lexicon of the average Imperial
student, Dr Wood has reintroduced
many obscure, not to say
obsolescent, words back into these
columns. For example, an article in
F E L I X 984 featured what was
only the second ever appearance
in these pages of the word
'peroration'. It was first used some
years ago by Professor Sir Hugo
Dregg-Strayner, holder of the
Tetley's Chair of Convection and
Diffusion, in an article entitled
'2000 Perorations'. However, this
is commonly held to have been a
misprint.
Yours sincerely,
Patrick Odwo.
Ed Sez: Enuogh of this feably
disguised self-publiciii. You are
blaleni and have no dress sense. As
the song says, 'if y'all got that
rewed-up geetar twang, / Your PR
don't need to shake his fhang /
Much.' In other words, theres only
room for one monster rampent
egomaniac on this paper and thats
me. To parafrase a famous dead
French king, 'le chai, c'esi moi'.
No Dead Fred
Dear F E L I X ,
I write with respect to the
absence of the Freddie Mercury
tribute that was supposed to be
unveiled in the grounds of Imperial
College. As Queen's No.l fan I
was unsure whether to follow in
my heroes' footsteps at Imperial or
LSE, but what really decided it was
the news, last year, that the
Mercury tribute would be here. I
was all set with my white spandex
jump suit open to waist and pencil
thin moustache to form a four
piece band, play a gig in the union
lounge and then kneel in homage
at my master's (bronze) feet,
mediating on the all the pain in
the world. But now I find that it's
me who has been cruelly treated.
How can anyone reject having
Freddie on the grounds????!!!!

Dear F E L I X ,
Am I the oldest student in
college? My first stint in the glory
days of IC life was in 1 909. Sadly,
the course I took in animal racing
finished soon after I had
graduated. But the stories about
the frantic football matches
between the animal racers and the
knitting post-graduates are still
passed down from father to son in
the yorkshire pit mining village
where I started work as a fresh
faced graduate - training pit
ponies. Yes, I know it wasn't
exactly what I was trained for, but
by golly, my Imperial education
had made me ready for any
challenge. Ponies have four legs
too you know and if they can't run
around in wheels that's only
because the wheels aren't big
enough. As my professor, Similey
Crow used to say at the start of
every lecture "four legs faster than
two...ZZZZZONK! (maybe fry
more ferrets next time - ed).
Who's that
Girl?
Dear Mr/Ms Editor,
What are you? Last March I put
my pen where my heart was and
voted for what I thought was an
attractive young lady editor of
F E L I X . It is to my horror that I am
informed that you are not of the
persuasion commonly called 'the
fairer sex'. I wish to publically
withdraw my vote unless you agree
to be cosmetically remoulded. I
myself used to be a 20 stone miner
called 'Angus' but after the chop
my life has been far more fulfiling.
I would recommend it to anyone.
yours high pitchedly,
A. McCelticRGreat (Ms)
Joke Letter
Dear F E L I X Reader,
Another year, another chance
to see the same old repeats: a
letters page of Wizard of Oz's and
M*A*S*H's with barely a 'Northern
Exposure' to sweeten the pill. We
at F E L I X T O W E R S are ever
obliging: it's your letters page,
write what you will. But if
'democracy' is our second name,
'sarcasm' is the embarrassing third
one that 'Big' Bob Bainbridge
flushed our heads down the toilet
to discover. Hence this handy
template, to make your letter
writing even easier!
Dear Owain FELIX Editor Cat
Socialist Worker: (underline one),
I am writing to express: (circle)
a) my unhinged devotion to your
wondrous organ and your long
brown-but-blonde-at-heart locks,
b) my concern at the lack of news/
multitude of reviews/egotistical
editor/unwillingness to publish my
articles that you have shown,
c) my strongly held belief that my
god is, beyond any shadow of
doubt, better than your God,
d) my ability to plug my club (isn't
that illegal and if not do you have
my number? - sick ed).
e) mu disgust at the miscarriages
I remain, forever: (circle)
a) Yours, Mrs Bennallack.
b) Disgruntled, Tunbridge Wells.
c) Barmy.
d) A constant harbinger of
boredom and bad prose. Stephen
Redsocks, Physics I. (Boomalaka,
Kangala and be part of it!!!)
e) a soldier of the red revolution,
Mariam Horse-Wells,
Knightsbridge. (P.S. I trust you
received this letter - my house has
been subject to a series of bizare
comical irregularities since the BBC
began filming 'Home Video Idiots'
in the flat next door.
Exclusively, here's our own
template we've used for the past 62
years when replying to letters!
a) Hi Mom!
b) Well, disgruntled, F E L I X can't
please everyone, so instead we
rather stoically aim to please me!
c) Can we have the cheque for the
latest advert please?
d) Due to print deadlines,
advertising constraints, prior
agreements and general concern
for the welfare of our readers, we
are bound to advise you to eat
rejection slip,
e) We must inform you that you
have mailed to the wrong mag.
However, you may be heartwarmed
to learn that your comical
exploding envelope has sent the
news editor into casualty at St
Mary's, where he is currently
investigating oysters, irregularities
and mergers with a bew/e of
beautiful nursettes.
