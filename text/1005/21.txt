HOW YOUR STUDENT BUSINESS
OFFICER C A N HELP YOU
Most students start each term with a reasonable amount of money.
But by the time accommodation and food are paid for, books are
bought, trips taken home and a bit of
social life lived, your income can quickly
disappear.
This is where your Student Business
Officers Jane Custons-Reynolds and Linda
Siriyatorn at the South Kensington branch
of Barclays come in. Jane and Linda are
specially trained to help untangle students'
financial problems. From the moment you open a current account
with Barclays, Jane and Linda will be available to discuss any of
those tricky problems that you are likely to face as a new student
and they can fully sympathise with the
kind of problems that you are likely to
come up against.
They'll understand the urgent need for
an expensive text book. And they know
that when financial problems mount up,
you'll need to talk them over with
someone.
So come to the South Kensington branch of Barclays and meet
them. You don't have to make an appointment, and they'll always
be willing to listen.
