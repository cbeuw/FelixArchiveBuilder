Opinion
Welcome, welcome, welcome
Good day to everyone reading
FELIX for the first time and hello
again to the rest of you. I hope,
you enjoy the contents of this issue
(and those ahead) and that the
new layout comes across as an
positive, improvement rather than
just, a new change of stripes! This
issue is designed as a one-off
'Freshers Issue' biased towards
features: news and reviews will
return soon! The exact format of
the newspaper is still somewhat in
a state of flux and so you may find
things changing over the weeks
ahead. This is perfectly normal —
do not adjust your set. If anyone
has any comments or suggestions,
favourable or otherwise, I'd be
happy to hear them at the usual
address.
The, boys of summer...
Ah, those lazy Indian summer
days. After a relaxed couple of
months everyone has suddenly
arrived to photocopy, advertise,
photocopy, contribute, photocopy;
print, photocopy and share my
jam doiuits. On lop of this we are
attempting to move house (or
rather my flatmates are
attempting to move my stuff - I
have editorials to write!) One, of
them just, arrived to say we can
now add a £30 parking ticket onto
the cost of transporting our
worldly possessions. Arrgh! The
cost, was high enough already -
this is our second move in a week.
The first failed because shortly
after signing contracts the
landlord informed us that, we
could not move in due to a slight
technical hitch: he didn't actually
own the Hat. Instead, we had to
wait in another flat for a week
(tenants or squatting I'm neither
sure, nor care any more). This was
originally clue to a delay in the
formality of paper signing clue to
'Jewish holidays'. Later it became
obvious that if this was true, then
Jewish people must be amongst
the most vacationally-abled
peoples of the world. Soon it was
official: there would be no flat.
Frantically we looked for another
place, and by spending over £200
(!) on an agent we, have finally
got one. The only snag is we
couldn't, move in until this
afternoon and the people due. to
move into our new flat, (that
wasn't ours) and is now our old
flat would be arriving sometime at
midday. But I live in FELIX now
it seems, so what do I care...
Communication
Something I am quite pleased
about, within this issue are the
articles on the walkway and the
phone system.
This is partially because
they required communication
between the student, media, the
union and 'college' to produce,
journalism which informs you of
what is happening around your
college and why. 1 hope that, we
can build up the relationship with
these disparate groups in the
coming months and that anyone,
regardless of position, can feel that
they can talk to us in a
professional manner concerning
any matter they believe to be
important.
The Constitution
The proposed new Imperial
College Union constitution,
(which, for new kids, provides the
'rules' for how the Union should
operate - in fact it defines the
Union) should be available for
inspection this week. Copies of the
main document body are already
available from the Union office,
but the appendices have been
delayed until Friday. I would
suggest, that anyone with even a
passing interest in the Union
consults these proposals and
considers how it may affect them:
from Union structure and student
representation to the operation of
their favourite clubs and societies.
Anyone, with queries, problems or
suggestions concerning the
constitution should visit, the
Sabbaticals in the Union office to
talk about them. The constitution
is set. to go before the first UGM of
term, October 14th, so act last if
you want to have your say. Full
details in next weeks FELIX.
Some thank you's
Finally I'd just like to thank a few
people for getting this issue out.
Everyone who has done anything
at all this week will know, I hope,
how useful they've been but
particular thanks to Paul for all
the layout designs we planned
together and threw away, as well
as the one we've ended up with.
Andy T., who has heard this one a
million times over the years I
know but it is still as valid and
sincere: ta for everything this
week, let's do that business
breakfast ya? Joe, you've, taught
me a lesson I hope I remember.
Finally to Jon, who really should
know better by now: you really
should know better by now...
