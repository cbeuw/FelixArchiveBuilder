Tears fall as Da Wind's
Floods on Freshers7
Eve
But the bar should be repaired in time for the arrival of students...
The soaking carpet had been
covered with plastic sheeting but
the devastation was obvious from
the toothy black holes in the
ceiling tiles. Da Vinci's snack bar,
the Unions' Beit Quad refectory,
was drenched around 9.00am on
Thursday, October 29th, by water
exploding from two open pipes on
the floor above.
The pipes were a defunct part,
of the buildings recently
modernised heating system.
Expecting all old pipes to have
been capped (sealed) the heating
engineers were, said to have,
confidently turned on the water: a
move, which resulted in two three
foot, high fountains issuing from
the capless pipes. It is not known
at this time why these open holes
were not. revealed when the
system was tested.
The fault, occurred in Union
advisor Minevar Kavlak's office
and was discovered by a cleaner
who heard the sound of gushing
water. He alerted Ian Parish,
Deputy President for Clubs and
Societies. College workmen were
also called. Mr Parish held fort
with a workman, stemming the
flow with his thumb. He was soon
aided by Dan Look, DP Finance
and Services, who later
commented: "I felt, like a Dutch
boy with my finger in a dyke..."
Eventually both DP's were
Happy hour again?
relieved and the pipes were
capped.
Meanwhile Union staff
worried anxiously at. the prospect
of facing freshers' week without
the bar. There were reports of
tears: certainly anxious faces were
worn by many. It was thought, at
first that power might, be lost, for a
week, an obviously calamitous
eventuality, but later these fears
were shown to be premature and
it is now anticipated, as FELIX
goes to press, that the engineers
can have the room ready by
Saturday. Miss Kavlak's room
escaped with only light: damage
and it is hoped that all costs will
be met through insurance.
Dan Look and. fan Parish decline to pull their thumbs out..
There are three things that
camefrom Budleigh Sallerlon this
year, and the poor litlle backwater
seaside resort on the south
Devonshire coast didn't know
what had hit it.
The first was the triumphant
return of Opsoc's summer tour
having played The Pirates of
Penzance and Daughters of
Misfortune to 10 packed
houses during their two
week stay. The second
is a secret, but will be
revealed in a dtrilling
tale of derring-do and
other nonsense,
accompanied by the strains of
1960's rock 'n' roll, 1970's glam
rock and a liberal dosage of the
musical delights of The Rocky
Horror Show, Return To The
Forbidden Planet and Little Shop
Of Horrors in: It Came From
Budleigh Salterton. It will be,
performed on Monday 7th
November following a weekend
workshop on the 5th and 6th.
The, whole thing is a send up of
those 50's and 60's science-fiction
B-movies and it promises to be a
real ...er...scream.
All this is just an excuse to
have several parties before we.
launch into our main event of the
year. Cabaret is the award-
winning show by Kander and Ebb
that was the inspiration for the
Oscar-winning film - amazingly
enough also called Cabaret - and
will be performed by the society in
February next year. All those
wishing to take part please form
an orderly queue on the left (all
those not wishing to take part,
please form an orderly queue for
your tickets on the right).
As time passes, it becomes
increasingly harder to outdo the
previous shows we have done.
Indeed, what, can you possibly do
if your last three shows have been
Grease, Anything Goes and
Chicago? In Cabaret we have just
what, we are looking for. The plot,
centres around two relationships:
those between a Jewish couple and
a cabaret singer and how she
meets and falls for an American
It Came From
Budleigh Salterton
visiting Berlin in the 1930's.
The humour is blacker than night,
and the Klub's eerie Master of
Ceremonies leads you on a sinister
journey through life in pre-war
Berlin. There arc many large and
small roles to be filled for this
production and the chorus have
plenty to do. The script is
wonderfully written and is
supported by the brilliant songs
that Kander and Ebb are famous
for. There is of course always
plenty to be done backstage so if
you feel like being part, of this
wonderful event in any capacity
(previous experience not
necessary), then come and see us
in the Union Concert Hall during
Fresher's Fair The first rehearsal
is on Monday 10th October at.
7.30 in the Union Concert Hall -
but we'll be meeting from 7pm in
Da Vinci's, because that's as good
excuse as any for a drink. For
any further information contact
Derek Hirst on extension 47236
or via the Union pigeonholes. For
(hose of you still counting, doing
Cabaret was the third thing to
come from Budleigh Salterton this
year.
