How to complain-effectively
a) A s a consumer
Under the Sale of Goods (Implied
Terms) A c t 1973 y o u are entitled to
return any faulty article to the retailer
from which you purchased it. Y o u c a n
have your money back and do not have
to accept a replacement, repair or credit
note unless you chose to. E x p e n s e s
incurred due to the fault c a n a l s o be
claimed from the shop. E x c e p t i o n s not
covered by the A c t are services such as
dry cleaning and goods bought at an
auction. N o r *can y o u complain if the
fault was brought to your attention i n the
shop or if y o u examined the article
before purchase and could reasonably
have noticed any defects.
Having decided to complain, what
do you do? Take the goods back to the
shop with the receit. If y o u obtain no
satisfaction write to the Head Office by
registered letter. T h e L S E l a w students
at the Welfare Centre c a n help y o u with
this. If this does not bring results you
can talte the matter to court. F o r articles
worth l e s s than £100 this w i l l only cost
you £5 which i s returnable i f you w i n the
c a s e . A g a i n the L S E students can advise
you.
In a private sale, for example, buying
a car from a private motorist, it i s up to
you to examine the v e h i c l e . Y o u may
and should, as i n any s a l e , check that the
seller i s the rightful owner. Redress i s
possible if, for example, the car i s not a s
described with respect to age or mileage.
b) A s a letter writer
Complaints about the G P O should
first be taken to the l o c a l P o s t O f f i c e .
If y o u get no joy then, check if there i s
a local P o s t Office A d v i s o r y Committee
(Addresses at the Welfare Centre or i n
the phone book). T h e s e are independent
voluntary bodies which advise the G P O
about local consumer needs. Another
source of help i s the P o s t Office U s e s
National C o u n c i l ( P O U N O , T e l : 01/928
9458. They are also an independent body
and exist solely to represent the consumer.
c) A s an N H S patient
You are legally entitled to be treated
with 'reasonable' care and s k i l l . If y o u
think you have suffered due to negligence
on the part of a G P , dentest o p t i c i a n , or
chemist contact the local F a m i l y
P r a c t i t i o n e r s ' Committee. If the complaint
concerns an hospital contact the Hospital
Administrator. A d v i c e on how to complain
can be obtained from your l o c a l community
Health C o u n c i l . A d d r e s s e s at the
welfare Centre or i n the phone book.
d) A s a rate payer
If you w i s h to complain about
maladministration by a l o c a l authority,'
or water authority you c a n make a complaint
through that authority to the l o c a l
Ombudsman. T h e Ombudsman i s an
independent Commissioner who c a n look
into the way things are handled, but not
the merits of any d e c i s i o n made b y the
authority. Contact the Welfare Centre for
further details.
We are open Mon — F r i 12.30 — 1.30pm;
legal advice o n Wednesdays, and are
located at the top of the U n i o n .

B U R N T H E WORK S H E E T S ! -
No joke; I am deadly serious.
Burn the heretic you a l l c r y , but
before you do, L e t me e x p l a i n ,
for those of you who c a n
imagine a world without them —
no harder than to imagine life
after death or o b l i v i o n , as the
c a s e may be, why 1 think they
are an insult to intelligence.
Anyone who does not know
what a work-sheet is should
be rejoicing and should check
that they are at IC or that they
have not been attending
courses elsewhere, erroneously.
I do not blame the people who
produce them — they are
involved in "more important"
things and have no time to
worry about the educational
merits of the work-sheet and
let's face it, most people at
IC actually believe they want
to do them — m a s o c i s t s !
The ones I receive are
master pieces among work-
sheets, butdoes this channelling
and normalisation of my
idea do me or anyone e l s e
any good?
T h i s raises the question of
the function of education in
s o c i e t y . Whatever may be s a i d ,
only someone living in
cuckooland could c l a i m the
system w a s not producing, at
a l ! l e v e l s , people with
regimented, stereotype minds
— an easy to handle commodity,
but for whom? Will they treat
us like any other consumable?
Who are the users?
Forgive me for thinking that
only one subject i s taught at
undergraduate level - that i s
conformitty, perhaps we have
some " u s e r s " here. Everyone
look up from your microcosmic
worlds, can you s e e any?
Factory fodder does not change
in essence over the y e a r s , or
up the educational ladder, it
just gets more sophisticated;
accountancy fodder or technical
fodder.
What about work sheets,
that method of education that
should have died out with
phlogiston theory: Denied of
the Zombi activity of putting
numbers into equations what
could you do? Start thinking!
You would have nothing better
to do than the subject y o u
came here for. What w a s it
c a l l e d now? Society strives to
negate experience: a second
law of thermodynamics operates
in reverse, if you let it, the
ways in which you think and
act will a l l be determined for
you.
S o c i a l l y , what goes on at
this C o l l e g e ? Tradition
demands that you get drunk
every other night and the
nights in between spent in
converse on the art of throwing-
up and what a swine you c a n
be towards women and other
minorities. From your first day
the unions make quite sure the
mindless tradition w i l l never
be forgotten.
There is a s o c i a l alternative.
Spend your evenings in your
own clique expanding the
frontiers of bourgeois ideaology.
How much have you experienced
of your subject life, each other
since you came here? T h e
opportunities exist, why not
make the most of them? Burn
the work sheets. It i s a step
in the right direction and
perhaps it could stop the
turning that must be going on
in the H u x l e y ' s family grave.
