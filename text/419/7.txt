Orienteering
Thrown off course
T H E R E WAS definitely
something s u s p i c i o u s about
the a c t i v i t i e s of several of our
senior orienteers last weekend.
F i r s t l y , David R o s e n , running
the Olympic marathon trial at
Rotherham, and thus disdaining
to take part in the Southern
Navigator's Event at Lower
Bourne Forest near Farnham.
Then, on Sunday morning
itself, A l a n Leakey proferring
vague e x c u s e s about not
running, otherwise engaged,
etc, and g u i z z i c a l glances from
the rest of us, who were
puzzled why this particular
event should seem so aversive,
e s p e c i a l l y on a blistering May
day.
It was not.until we reached
our destination that we saw the
light of day. Owing to a
limited supply of maps, the
organisers had fitfully decided
that competitors on the ' A '
and ' B ' courses should run
'Map Memory' - which b a s i c a l l y
entailed trying to memorise the
course, not in whole (perhaps
this fate w i l l await us shortly),
from control to control. Those
new to this type of competition
envisaged orienteering without
a map being somewhat akin to
kamikazi.
Undaunted, we rose to the
occasion in differing orders of
magnitude. On the ' A ' course,
C l i v e R e i d in 85.15 and Steve
Webb in 105.31 managed to
overcome the technical
difficulties of the latter part
of the course, which forced Ian
Isherwood to retire. T o add
insult to injury, Steve later
showed Ian his mistake. On the
shorter ' B ' course, which was
really the first 1/3 rds of the
MINING H O U S E triumphed in the
RSM 6 — A - s i d e soccer com-
petition last Saturday, by
defeating Mat Met 1, 2—0 in
the semi-final and Geology 2 A ,
2—1 in the f i n a l . Mining house
failed to produce their expected
fluent, enterprising football in
the early league matches,
though s t i l l getting through to
the last four. The semi-final
and final were entirely different
stories with Mining house
producing some exhilarating
play. In the semi-final a
brilliant move, involving
' A ' course, Tim Murphy in
95.25 narrowly beat Mike
Welford by two minutes.
Fortunately, both courses
were not too challenging,
though many would testify that
the dense forest areas were to
be avoided at all c o s t s .
Enterprisingly, three of our
accompaniment declined the
challenge, and chose the ' C
course, a chance to employ
real orienteering techniques
with a proper map, and humor-
ously picture the quixotic
adventures of the fool-hardy.
On a course slightly shorter
than the ' B ' course, Hans
Achtrick, a friend of A l a n ' s ,
found the terrain to his liking,
recording 52.57; Jon Gibbins
(66.05) and Diane Benge
(74.15) in creditable times,
enforced the rule that n a v i -
gating with a map was a much
more time-saving pastime
than relying on an ever-
forgetful memory.
For those who are interested
in this mentally-exacting,
though not necessarily
physically-demanding s p o r t ,
the club holds weekly lunchtime
meetings every Friday in the
Union Senior Common Room,
where you w i l l learn more of
our a c t i v i t i e s , both sporting
and s o c i a l , to which all are
welcome. The next event is on
Sunday 16th May, in Epping
Forest, a Badge Event
organised by C h i g w e l l O C ,
where there w i l l be courses for
the novice and the expert —
the club lends out whistle
and compasses for newcomers,
the only other requirement
being a modicum of common
sense.
precision passing from Hal let
and Johnson, tantalising
dribbling by Frampton and
Duncan. Was finished superbly
by a pavlov volley. In the final
Geology 2A made Mining house
work hard, but through agile
goal keeping by Mayo, three
efforts by Duncan which hit
the cross bar, and two well —
taken individual goals by
Frampton, Mining house were
deserved winners. Congratula-
tions must go to the organisers
andtheteams for making it such
an enjoyable day's soccer.
In the second of a world
s h a t t e r i n g series of
appearances, Martin B l e a s d a l e
took his K a w a s a k i 400 to the
Bemsee A c e of C l u b s Road
Races at Snetterton (near
Norwich) on May 1st. The
glory was to be all Martin's
as our other racer, N i c k James,
had left his Velocette in
Birmingham (so he claimed)
and could not compete. Instead,
he was relegated to racing
the van!
Practice was at 11am for
the K a w a s a k i and, unfamiliar
with the circuit, Martin took a
slight detour along the grass
verge at Sears Corner, doing a
sedate 60mph. The marshals
looked quite peturbed! On the
second and s u c c e s s i v e tries, a
more conventional cornering
style was adopted.
Martin's first race was the
100cc Production R a c e , with
machines such as Honda
750-4s, Norton Commandos
and, of course, Yamahas,
St Johns C o l l e g e , Cambridge
usually provide strong opposition
and this year was no e x c e p t i o n .
IC 1st XI travelled down feeling
confident yet were narrowly
beaten in a surprisingly low
scoring match.
A n early c o l l a p s e and then
a painfully slow accumulation
of 128 runs left St Johns ample
time to score the required runs.
Several of I C ' s batsmen were
out playing premeditated shots,
frustrated by the persistent
accuracy of the oppositions
bowling. The c o l l a p s e was s l o w
and the resistance strong yet
the performance was feeble
and very tedious.
200 again
A W E E K A G O on Wednesday
IC 1st XI played South Stanmore
at Harlington. After a very
brisk start of 48 runs in 20
minutes (Tom Ghosh 3 1 ,
Tony Paul 27) there was a
lull in the scoring, but once
V i c k Brown (76 not out) and
Richard Pashley (52 not out)
had settled in IC were able to
declare at tea with the score
at 202 for 3.
After tea, Chandra Kulkarni
achieved the initial break-
through by taking the first
two w i c k e t s . The subsequent
collapse was brought about
by some excellent bowling by
John Gowlett (5 for 26) and
the opposition were all out for
66.
Suzukis and K a w a s a k i s . Still
unfamil.iar with the circuit,
Martin finished 34th out of 36,
with his lap times getting better
each lap. He a l s o got a Bemsee
Championship pointforfinishing
10th in his c l a s s . The race
was won by Tom Pemberton on
his K a w a s a k i 500. Gets
everywhere, that one.
The second race of Martin's
day was a l s o for 1000cc
production machines. On his
second lap, he had a " m o m e n t "
on Corams Corner but thought
it was merely too much power
too early. On his next v i s i t to
Corams, he found a pile of
machines on the s i d e of the
track where the race leaders
had discovered the oil Martin
s l i d on, Fortunately, no one
was badly hurt. Martin finished
the race 31st out of 36, having
had a dice with 3 Yamahas
and getting ahead of two of
them. W e ' l l be back later for
the rest of the f i e l d !
R . S . L . Wilkes
St Johns were forced to fight
and the result was in question
till near the end. Some
excellent c a t c h e s , notably two
taken by the wicketkeeper
John Thombank kept the
pressure on St Johns, however
not all chances were taken-
They scored the winning runs
with three overs of their last
twenty remaining. T h i s was a
disappointing p e r f o r m a n c e
considering the results of the
matches of the s e a s o n .
IC Sunday XI v Parkfield II
A F T E R A s o l i d start IC
scored s t e a d i l y with
contributions from all batsmen
notably John Thornback (26).
The tail had a last fling and
the captain declared at 147 for
8.
The opposition were soon
struggling against good
accurate bowling and N i c k
Treen guile and pace (?) was
too much for them. However
they managed to hold on for a
draw at 86 f o r 8 . Congratulations
are due for an excel lent fielding
d i s p l a y ; several good c a t c h e s
were taken and the ground
fielding was very keen indeed.
