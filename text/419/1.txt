Telephone Bills- PO errors or student fiddle?
PhoneHang-ups
PO backs down on 2 Hall bills
C O N F U S I O N NOW surrounds the profitability of 'call-box'
phones in halls of residence following Monday's meeting of
the Finance Sub-Committee of the College Student Residence
Committee (SRC)*. At the meeting Wardens and student
representatives heard that bills from the Post Office ( P O )
for the use of these phones exceeded cash reciepts by a
staggering £ 4 , 9 0 5 for this session alone'.
The figures presented to the
meeting showed deficits of
£1338 for the B e i t H a l l P h o n e s ,
£1548 for those i n T i z a r d H a l l
and £1578 for those in L i n s t e a d
H a l l . T h i s information was con-
firmed by the C o l l e g e finance
department on Wednesday.
Investigation
The C o l l e g e ' has a s k e d the
P O to investigate the d i s -
crepancies to eliminate any
p o s s i b i l i t y o f meter errors at
their end. Just prior to going
to press F E L I X understands
that the P o s t Office h a s
backed down over their b i l l s
for T i z a r d and L i n s t e a d H a l l s .
They have yet to report back
on the b i l l for B e i t H a l l .
There i s a strong likelihood
that they w i l l back down here
as well since one phone i n
B e i t w a s billed for an extra-
ordinary £600 in February.
" N o comment"
Contacted by F E L I X , the
P O declined to comment o n the
discrepancies and a spokesman
for the Engineering department
said it w a s strictly a matter
between I C and the P o s t
O f f i c e .
The current situation arises
because C o l l e g e o f f i c i a l s empty
the ' c a l l - b o x ' phones every
two weeks and the P O b i l l
I C by their meter readings at
P O exchange every month.
L a s t year the C o l l e g e made
a net l o s s o f £83 for a l l the
call-box phones in h a l l s of res-
idence. U n t i l February, the
S R C had budgeted for the same
l o s s this year. However, phone
b i l l s then increased the estim-
ate to £775. L a s t Monday, this
figure w a s again r a i s e d , this
time to £5,000, i n the wake of
the P o s t Office b i l l s .
T h e figures have brought to
the surface the state of disrep-
air of some P . O . phones in the
h a l l s . R o n K i l l , subwarden of
T i z a r d H a l l , complained that
'the phones are not maintained
properly'. Further, one of the
T i z a r d phones i s currently giv-
ing free c a l l s . Mr K i l l w a s
unaware whether this had been
reported to the C o l l e g e or the
G . P . O .
Another incident occured last
February (197 5) whe n two phone s
in L i n s t e a d H a l l were forcibly
robbed.
Authorities baffled
A t present the C o l l e g e auth-
orities are baffled by the phone
b i l l d i s c r e p a n c i e s , other than
suggesting a mistake at the
P o s t Office end. Nevertheless
in 1973 a former I C student was
prosecuted for fraudulent use of
G . P . O . phones at I C . A t that
time the C o l l e g e was concerned
over the number of students
obtaining free c a l l s by using
e n g i n e e r s * s p e c i a l c o d e s .
F E L I X understands that this
loophole h a s now been c l o s e d .
Other i l l e g a l practices i n
this f i e l d include the u s e of
'tone b o x e s ' and wire tapping
to e l e c t r i c a l l y simulate the i n -
sertion of c o i n s . A telephone
engineer conacted by F E L I X
s a i d that elaborate methods
would be required to accomplish
t h i s . H e d i d not say that either
were beyond the ingenuity o f
IC students.
AGM report
At the A G M yesterday B i l l
Gerrard, R o n K i l l and John
Downs were awarded the Union
General Award by I C Union
president Peter Teague. T h e
awards were made i n recognition
of their s e r v i c e s to the Union.
S o c i a l C o l o u r s and A C C
A t h l e t i c Colours were also aw-
arded. Ian Morse and G i l l M c -
C o n w a y , the two full-time staff
who work o n F E L I X , were
awarded S o c i a l C o l o u r s a s was
John M c C l o s k e y w h o has been
the F E L I X T e c h n i c a l Manager
for the past two years.
The meeting a l s o d i s c u s s e d
h a l l and house rents and refec-
tory p r i c e s . It had been dec-
ided at a n S R C meeting that
there would be attempts to make
the residence accounts break
even next year. However, this
would mean a 30% increase i n
rents to raise the £80,000 requ-
ired.
Southside h a l l rents would
go up from £7.25 to £9.40 a n d
house rents for single rooms
from £6.20 to over £7.
The meeting decided that any
rent increases must keep rents
w i t h i n the national element for
accommodation a s allowed i n
the student grant.
A 10% flat increase i n refec-
tory prices and a l l o w i n g them to
float with commodity prices had
been put forward by the Catering
Manager, but the proposal met
with a cool reception. In view
of the U n i o n ' s p o l i c y that refec-
tory prices should only go up
once a year, a suggestion by
John Downs that we opt for a
large flat percentage increase
seems l i k e l y to be the line f o l -
lowed in negotiations with the
C o l l e g e .
Jez conks out
J E Z , the R C S ' s 1916 Dennis
fire engine, suffered severe
damage when she broke down on
K i n g ' s R o a d , C h e l s e a last
Sunday afternoon. T h e damage
caused i s estimated at over
£1000.
The fire engine stuttered to
a hult with pieces of metal left
trailing behind it. It appears
that a camshaft journal moved
into the path of the N o . 3
con-rod which bent the other
camshaft and broke the con-rod.
T h i s con-rod then cracked the
piston a n d put holes i n the
crank c a s e and sump.
J e z w a s towed back to its
garage behind the Biochemistry
building by Exploration B o a r d ' s
K - 9 lorry.
E a r l i e r in the d a y , J e z h a d
taken part in the F E L I X Treasure
Hunt which w a s narrowly won
by the B o ' team. Beaten into
second place were the R C S
second team of Dave Dodge,
Graham P a t e r s o n and N i g e l
D a v i e s .
T h i s was the s e c o n d treasure
hunt organised by F E L K and a
f u l l completent of teams from
each C C U took part. T h e
contestants found the clues
so difficult that, i n retribution,
some of them dumped P a u l
B e n t l e y ' s c a r inside B e i t
Archway thus blocking i t .
Attempts to put the car inside
the F E L I X Office failed
because the doors are not
wide enough.
