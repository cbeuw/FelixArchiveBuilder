Alexander Solzhenitsyn — Gulag
Archipelago vol 2 (Fontana 695pp, £1.00)'.
W H E N I F I R S T read volume one of this
three volume history of the R u s s i a n Terror
(before, during and after the Stalinist
period), I thought that it was the most
disturbing thing I had ever read. The
first volume dealt mainly with the
interrogation and transport of prisoners —
this book is almost entirely devoted to
the destructive labour camps themselves.
It was not difficult to find oneself in
such a camp; Solzheritsyn records hundreds
of individual s t o r i e s . F o r example, the
farmer who swore at his c o w ; the deaf
mute who hung h i s jacket on a bust of
Lenin - ten years! The couple sentenced
for holding a spiritualist s e a n c e ; the
alcoholic who received eight years for
drinking! And when one individual w a s
arrested, a l l the members of h i s family
were pulled in as w e l l , and a l l their
neighbours who had failed to inform on
them! We must not forget the thousands of
Only for strong stomach
people pulled in off the streets at random
and given ten or twenty year sentences!
T h e picture is indeed horrifying. Very
few survived their sentences - and those
who did so were immediately given
additional terms!
What was the purpose of all this?
P a r t i a l l y , the author e x p l a i n s , to provide
a s l a v e labour force, but primarily to
force the population into a fear of
stepping out of line, of daring to c r i t i c i s e
authority or any aspect of the state. The
work for which the s l a v e labour was used
w a s not a l w a y s urgent or even u s e f u l .
F o r example, the Stalin White Sea -
B a l t i c C a n a l , built on a whim of the
leader in twenty months. During one
winter 100,000 men, women and children
(yes, and it w a s policy to divide families
into different camps) died on this one
project — and their bones can be seen in
the concrete of the c a n a l .
T h i s canal served and serves no
naval use whatsoever. But it provided
one more pit to devour the s o c i a l l y
undesirable elements.
It is interesting to follow the corruption,
even of s o c i a l i s m , within the camps; the
development of a rigid c l a s s structure; the
ever increasing use of competition and
incentives in order to f u l f i l l the work
norms; and the large s c a l e cheating
used to receive higher rations.
We are told how this corruption leaked
out into society at large and we receive
other valuable insights into that s o c i e t y .
One sentence, in particular, stands out —
"out of every four to five city dwellers
there would most certainly be one who at
least once in his life had received a
proposal to become an informer".
T h i s is certainly more disturbing than
V o l One — I advise you not to read it
unless you have a strong stomach'

A remarkable tale
T S E l i o t : The Great Literary Hoax by
L B Gowers (Penguine 60p)'.
IN 1917 E B Hatchard, a young Cambridge
Don, published " P r u f r o c k and other
o b s e r v a t i o n s " under the pseudonym of
TS Eliot. T h i s collection of " p o e m s "
was intended as a satire on E z r a Pound,
whose irreverent and frivolous peoms had
irritated Hatchard. One example of this
frivolity is P h y l l i d u l a , w h i c h , perhaps
suggests a c l a s s i c a l poem, but starts
" P h y l l i d u l a is scrawny but a m o r o u s " .
The portrait of the w h i m s i c a l but rather
pretentious young man in " T h e L o v e
Song by J Alfred P r u f r o c k " was intended
to represent Pound's poetry.
The next poem, " A Portrait of a L a d y ' ,
parodies Pound's 'Portrait d'une Femme'
by use of a complete antithesis of
style. Hatchard chose the name 'TS Eliot'
because it is an anagram of toilets, the
only place Hatchard felt suitable for
Pounds poetry.
A further c o l l e c t i o n was published in
1920, which included the notorious
and obscurely obscene Sweeny Poems.
(In fact, Sweeny E r e c t includes a graphic
description of intercourse behind the
facade of words.)
' T h e Waste L a n d ' , the next to be
published, and the most famous poem,
parodies not only Pound, to whom it is
dedicated, but a l s o others such as
Rupert Brook, (the first part is an
analogue of his 'Gruntchester', and a l s o
working c l a s s s p e e c h , cf the latter part
of ' A Game of C h e s s ' , with its grating
she saids.)
These satines were initially circulated
only in Cambridge, until 1932 when a
pupil of Hatchard's, F R L e a v i s , published
an essay ' N e w Bearings in E n g l i s h
Poetry' (available in P e l i c a n ) . Since
then, the joke has spread far beyond the
confines of Cambridge, and as a result of
further ' e c p o s i t i o n ' by various dilettantes,
what originally began as a s c h o l a s t i c
joke is now taken seriously by many
dabblers in poetry.
T h i s remarkable tale of a pseudonym
which became one of the best known poets
of this century provides much to amuse
those more interested in this area,
although much of the original humour of
poems is lost, since attitudes and
fashions have changed so much. The
style of the book makes it fairly easy
going, although some of the detailed
a n a l y s i s becomes d u l l , as do most jokes
which have to be explained. T h i s is a
book I would thoroughly recommend,
although to those few IC students who
have heard of TS E l i o t , it may come as an
embarrassment to realise that they have
been duped. Hilax
Music
Better than Skol
T H I S L P stands out, with few others,
as one of the really worthwhile musical
efforts of the last twelve months and,
treads the ground that good music should
tend towards — quality songs, great,
c l e a n , production, most important of a l l ,
peerless musicianship — guys who are
capable of playing whatever i s asked of
them and of constantly inventing within any
time—signature or background you care
to c h o o s e .
Beautiful, beautiful, sounds cover
both s i d e s . Moody and yet c a r e s s i n g l y
soft acoustic piano/orchestra 'sound
effect interludes slotted between some
of the sharpest rhythmic j a z z yet produced
by the new wave artists, such as B i l l y
Cobham, Horble Hancock, and Return
to Forever (with whom Lenny White is
resident percussion maestro), that are
finally receiving some of th3 popularity
they deserve.
Trtere are also some excellent, new,
axenen on this album (nam<3checks for
Raymond G O . T V B Z and Doug Rodriguez —
big futures there) and who w j u l d have
thought ex-santa;ioid Doug Rauch capable
of such ferociously fine b a s s buzzing,
considering the number of mantras and
<V:rto-compositions the poor s o d ' s had
to endure. Santana could w e l l be better
off doing this instead of allowing C B S
to release cheapo, direlict, live, triple —
album recordings from some obscure
N i p Astrodome.
So while everybody looks around for
guitarists with enough guts, brains, and
sure touch to *avage some horizon,
albums of this quality go unnoticed, and
toys like Queen get landed on us as the
mesiahs of the new. year. If you want
to hear a real guitar solo, worthy of
restoring yer faith in the instrument,
listen to the opening minutes of " M a t i n g
D r i v e " on side two — a mass of power
playing and invention unlikely to be
heard elsewhere for some time, and the
unstoppable beat makes the number
more Invogorating than the proverbial
knee-tremblers. Forget Skol — this
refreshes you best. It's even more
memorable for It's complete d i s s i m i l a r i t y
to the anaemic pop " m u s i c " currently
churned out by the media.
J u s t feast your ears on this beauty.
Nothing but unreserved praise Is deserving
for Lenny White, his cohorts, and the
far-seeing, clear-thlnking, cognoscenti
of Atlantic Records (standing ovation)
for making available such a good record
against recent trends. Great stuff!
