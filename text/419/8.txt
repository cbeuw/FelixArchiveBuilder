IC retain U L U
championship
For the second successive
year IC won the University of
London Athletic Championship
due to several enthusiastic
performances in previously
untried events and the strength
and depth of middle distance
running of the college.
The day's athletics started,
a predictable half an hour later
than scheduled with the
hammer event. Our three
throwers all found this
event a little difficult, but with
a little determination and a lot
of strength each managed
commendable distances gaining
second fourth and fifth places.
Our one sprinter, Alan
Gregory was IC's only sprint
finalist of the day coming
fifth in the hundred metres.
The first success of the
day came in the 3000 metres
steeplechase, Rob Allinson
stormed round the seven and
a half laps unconcerned about
his two foot landing technique
in the water jump to finish
first. Ian Ellis suffering a
little in the dust storm created
by Rob came in second only
thirty yards behind him and
two hundred in front of the next
man.
Whilst Rob Doyle, Gordon
Chandler and John walked to
the Shot Putt c i r c l e , a quick
s p i k e change s a w Dave Henton
win through to the final of the
400m recording a personal best
at the same time.
The 3000m walk was
attempted by Dave Lord and
Mike " S t r o l l e r " Welford. A
dubious style of walking down
the back straight by some
opposition meant the IC had to
be content with second and
fourth place.
Andy Davey salvaged a
point from the 400m hurdles,
an event in which we definitely
missed I C ' s Dave West.
With wet s p i k e s dried in the
baking s u n , Rob A l l i n s o n
proceeded to win the 5000m at
a steady pace, just fast enough
to keep the second place man,
Steve Webb from trying anything
fast on the last lap.
A n hour later the temper-
ature had dropped below 7 0 * F
and seven coughing IC runners
went back on to the cinder
track to start the 1500m.
The field of twenty runners
set off at a brisk pace and at
1000m to go IC were holding
2,3,4,5,6 p o s i t i o n s . In the last
four-hundred metres this had
changed to 1,3,4 and 6th p l a c e s
with Rob A l l i n s o n winning.
The order was retained with

IC 3rds v Melrose
T H E C O U R A G E O U S cricketers
of IC 3rds set out to do battle
against Melrose on a scorching
May day (302 K). The skipper
of the thirds won the toss and
decided to bat. Twenty runs
were briskly scored before the
loss of the first w i c k e t . After
the loss of another wicket and
Ken Cowan came in to bat and
scored 49 out of the tea-time
total of 95 for 9. The last
wicket soon fell leaving
Melrose plenty of time in which
to score the 99 runs required,
a task which they never looked
likely to f a i l .
For IC Paul A l l a n (Geordie)
took five good w i c k e t s but
Melrose scored the necessary
runs for the loss of s i x w i c k e t s .
It was a disappointing perform-
ance by the 3rds and some
better batting w i l l be required
in future games.
Steve Webb third a second or
two in front of Ian E l l i s ;
Tony Weir came in s i x t h .
Imperial won the team
trophy by seven points (84)
from. Royal Holloway C o l l e g e .
Thanks must go to a l l the
athletes who turned up and
managed to keep the cup where
it belongs.
P S . I wish we could find some
sprinters. b y , „ E | | j s
EARLY COLLAPSE
KNOCKS OUT IC
IC 2nd XI v Kenton Traders
IC WON T H E toss and decided
to bat on a pitch which had
taken a lot of rain in the past
24 hours. The opposition
opening bowlers s u c c e s s f u l l y
swung the ball around and the
college team were soon in
troubel at 18 for 3. The c o l l a p s e
continued to 66 for 8 wickets
with the spin bowlers getting
a lot of turn from the pitch.
However two excellent stands
between Trewhella, the
opening batsman, and firstly
Rickard and then Young
suceeded in giving the IC
bowlers a chance when the
opposition batted. F i n a l l y , with
90 minutes to play IC declared
at 1 1 6 - 9 , with Trewhella 53
not out and the pitch apparently
.becoming easier to bat on.
The opening bowlers
succeeded in containing the
Kenton batsman, Sparke took 2
w i c k e t s and with the spin
bowlers coming on, Kenton
were struggling at 45—5 after
2 wickets in 2 b a l l s for
Whatting. However, the batsmen
then began to get on top.
Althougttthe ball w a s frequently
in the air it hardly ever went
to hand and Kenton ran out the
winners by 5 wickets with
only 3.3 overs left to play.
