The Fremlin Cup Final
Moorhouse makes
it at last!
L a s t Monday s a w the
culmination of this y e a r ' s
firecely contested competition
for the coveted, darts s i n g l e s ,
knock-out trophy, the F r e m l i n
P o t . T h e record entry of 40
had been reduced to the eight
quarter finalists w h o were
paired thus:- T o m A d e y v
Andy Gribble; Steve Jones v
Mike G i b s o n ; Andy Slack v
Steve Moorhouse and A l a n
Whatling v R i c h a r d Parmentero
For those intrigued by
coincidences a l l the tosses
came up heads and the player
from the bottom half draw won
2—0, though those s c o r e l i n e s
might be misleading with
respect to the quality o f play
in these matches. D e s p i t e the
considerable tension involved,
the finals were of a high
standard and provided a great
deal of entertainment on the
night. T h e highest score in this
round and, in fact, of the whole
evening w a s Andy G r i b b l e ' s
137 (60 2 0 57) who only h a d
123 to get at the time.
Competent finishing proved
to be the d e c i s i v e factor i n
these matches and the semi-
finals were no exception.
Despite the wildly fluctuating
score, players tended to
finish together which meant
that the slow scorers were
able to take advantage of the
faster scorers' poor finishing
ability. Thus Steve Moorhouse
and Mike G i b s o n ran out winners]
over Richard Parmenter and
Andy Gribble r e s p e c t i v e l y .
The stage w a s then set for
a tense, a l l left-handed f i n a l .
Steve w o n the toss in this
" b e s t of f i v e " final and
promptly stormed ahead with
throws of 101, 100 and 60.
H i s b a d finishing, after
reaching a double top, was
punished by Mike who had been
doggedly c h a s i n g him.
However, this proved to be
M i k e ' s last fling as h i s nerves
became the better of him and
Steve took the next three
games in s u c c e s s i o n . So after
numerous attempts Steve
finally won the Fremlin a n d
denied Mike the opportunity of
holding both major I C darts
titles i n the same year.
P a u ' WhiVock
1F Only:.
Y O U A R E about to read the
first gripping installment of a
new series of IF O n l y s . (After
an introduction like that I
doubt very much whether you're
about to read anything of the
kind). Well, if that's your
attitude, you just B O F F ! (I'm
awfully sorry about that —
everyone seems to be under the
impression that us I F ' e r s are
gentile young maidens, (oh,
y e a h ? - E d ) , s o I therefore
appeal to the minority who may
c l a s s themselves a s such to
forgive me for that devastatingly
porn-oh outburst. Sorry.)
If you were offended, don't
read on, because I'm in a dead
narsty mood; apart from the fact
that I've just shut the door on
my finger and definitely failed
my blasted German Chamber of
Commerce exam (which I didn't
really care two hoots about...
much!), my dratted watch h a s
broken and the bath water was
c o l d . N o w if that wouldn't puW
you in a bad mood, you must be
an absolute angel, and that
means you haven't been at IF
very long. I w i l l , therefore,
personally honour you with a
further free two-year course at
I'lnstitut F r a n c a i s du Royaume-
Uri where you w i l l be transformed
into a normal person or worse,
as Dave Chance w i l l tell y o u .
H e ' s been here quite a few
times, and h e ' s definitely
worse.
Enough of this rebaldry. T o
any of you who have completely
forgotten that there w a s ever
such an article as ' I F O n l y ' ,
then I w i l l remind y o u . It's
I F ' s very own little portion of
' F E L I X ' , where any of us c a n
release our fee I i ngs on anyth i ng,
and P i n g - P o n g (our friendly,
fuzzy, fungus-topped F E L I X
Editor) has told me, in perosn,
that we are under no obligation
to keep it c l e a n . So if you have
any emotional, personal or
sexual problems, forget about
Anna Rayburn and launch
yourself into writing an ' I F
O n l y ' . It may not solve your
hang-ups but at least it w i l l
provide I C ' s Union E x e c with
a bit of fresh scandal to gloat
over in the Union bar.

Attack on critics
Sir, - Often in the past I have
read the record reviews and
thought that the c r i t i c knew
nothing about the artist(s)
whose record he was reviewing:
now I know that he knows
nothing.
I have no complaints about
his review of the tracks, a s
that i s a purely personal
viewpoint, but when he talks a
load of bullshit about the
artist that i s different.
The record that I refer to
is " S a y it ain't s o " , by Murray
Head. I would like to list below
some of the absurd statements
made in the review:
1. Quote " . . . t h e bulk of Head's
efforts earn him zero for star
q u a l i t y " Murray head was for a
couple of years the original
Judas in " J e s u s Christ
Superstar", one of the main
parts in the show. B e s i d e s this
Mr Head i s playing support to
Elton John on h i s latest tour -
zero for star qual ity, o b v i o u s l y !
2. Quote " H e might well have
been flustered by h i s first
venture to a recording studio''
F i r s t venture!! A s previously
stated, he played the part of
Judas on the stage and a l s o on
the original sound track (poss-
ibly on the film a s w e l l , but
I'm not too sure). A s well a s
this he released an L P on
C B S c a l l e d " N i g e l L i v e d " .
The L P took the form of a
diary of a boy who comes down
to the big city ie London to
seek fame and fortune, but
gets in with different types
and eventually ends up a
drug addict. T h e L P has a few
trite songs; but the overall
sound is good, and w a s well
received by most of the c r i t i c s
in the genuine music papers.
Thus, this i s Murray H e a d ' s
third venture into the studio
and, in my most livible
opinion seeing that we people
outside the literary field
know s o little about music, h i s
best s o far. I have to agree
about the song " Y o u ' r e so
T a s t y " , but a l l of the others
are done in the usual superb
Murray Head s t y l e .
3. Quote "Murray Head has
...yet to discover what he does
b e s t " .
If he doesn't do anything
well then why w a s a whole
programme dedicated to him
and h i s music on C a p i t a l
Radio a few weeks ago? Surely,
they must know what is going
to draw the audiences away
from the B B C stations.
4. Quote " . . . o r Head is low
on talent. Judging from the
frail vocals I suspect the
latter".
I feel that I have said
sufficient to show that he i s
not that low on talent, a n d ,
in fact, very far from it.
About the songs: George
Melly May be able to do a
version of " S o m e o n e s Rocking
My Dreamboat" which is
closer to the original 1920's
version of the song but the
Murray Head version is how he
wants to do it, not how you want
him to do it. What about
" N e v e r E v e n T h o u g h t " and
" S i l e n c e i s a Strong R e p l y "
they stand out even more
than " B o a t s A w a y " and
" D o n ' t Forget Him N o w " .
In future I ask; please don't
tell everything that y o u think
you know about an artist when
in fact you know nothing.
That is about a l l that I
really wish to gripe about. B e
warned, the reader doesn't
like printed ignorance.
Yours,
W . P . J A C K S O N
