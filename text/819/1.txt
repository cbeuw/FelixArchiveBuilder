A project to utilise 'underused space'
College drafts plan
for health club
The College has drawn up draft
proposals for a Health Club to be
placed opposite 'The Gardens'
restaurant under Southside Hall. It
is hoped that the club will include
multigym and weights facilities and
a solarium and saunas. If the
proposals are agreed to as they pass
through Union and College
Committees, construction work,
costing around Â£500,000, could start
by the Summer Vacation.
College Building Planning Officer,
Brian Dennis, has drawn up a draft
plan of the Health Club, to go before
the College's Finance sections and
Union and College Officials. The
plans propose a conversion of the
present weights room into a
multigym area, and the installation
of a new weights room in what is
currently a large toilet area.
When describing his reasons for
the plans, Mr Dennis said 'there is
a lot of underused space.' If
implemented, the plans would also
include provision for a Sports Shop
and a reception area and lounge.
Improvements to the toilet and
changing facilities in the Martial Arts
area above the weights room are
also planned. Mr Dennis hopes to
see a 'quality' development. "There
is no point doing things by halves'
he said.
The proposals include
improvements to the ventilation
system in the area, which have been
said to be poor.
College Secretary, John Smith told
FELIX that the College is hoping to
'maximise the use' of the space
under Southside, currently used as

He went on to say that the idea
came from last year's Athletics
Clubs Committee (ACC) Chairman,
Rob Gee.
Mr Smith said that the College's
Finance section is currently making
'financial projections', which he
hopes will be available shortly. The
'projections' will look at the possible
opening hours of the proposed
facility, as well as staffing levels and
the possibility of a membership
system. He said that he thought the
club -could be run in a similar
manner to the College's Sports
Centre in Prince's Gardens
although, he added, 'it is a very
different kind of facility.'
If the proposals receive a
favourable response from the
numerous people involved, the
College will take out a loan to fund
the project. Union President, Nigel
Baker and Manager, Dave Peacock
are keen to see the Union back the
project if it is acceptable to them.
Mr Baker told FELIX that he
would like to see the Union use its
income from the Harlington Gravel
it owns or obtain a loan from the
College to finance the plans. He
added that the Union would seek to
manage the club if the Union backed
it.
Mr Smith said he thought that the
question of management was
'something to be decided.''
ballot on
exam veto
The Association of University
Teachers (AUT) may boycott
examinations, if a ballot of the
tnion's members agrees.
The union decided to ballot its
members at an Executive meeting
an Wednesday. Papers will be
distributed today with replies due
by December 12. The result of the
ballot will be known by December
14. If the ballot agrees, the union
will 'withdraw entirely from
participation in any part of the
examination process,' from January
9 1989.
The ballot comes after the
University Authorities Panel (UAP)
ailed to produce a pay offer at a
neeting on Monday. In a report
rrom the AUT and the Committee
of Vice Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP), of which the UAP is a sub-
committee, pay increases were
agreed for December 1 1986 and
March 11988. The report concluded
that a further increase would be
desirable by April 11988. This offer
has not been made.
A spokesman from the CVCP said
that it had not been possible to make
the further pay increase, due to a
lack of funding from the
Government. The next increase for
AUT members is due on April 1
1989.
In a press statement on
Wednesday, the AUT said they
were 'seeking a reasonable pay
settlement for 1988 and a
satisfactory 1989/90 negotiating
timetable.' They aim to receive a
settlement in 1989 which will be in
line with other public sector groups.
The AUT claims that academic
and related staff are being
defrauded of 'their legitmate pay
