'1000, 2000, 3000, 4000. Check
Canopy!' That'srightthe immortal
phrase of first time parachutists, a
phrase that nearly all of the 35
students that did the course forgot!
Well wouldn't you forget when
balanced on your right cheek in the
doorway of a plane with only your
socks and the soles of your boots
between you and the ground 2,000
feet below.
Despite this slight amnesia
everybody's parachute opened
perfectly as they nearly always do
using the static line system that
opens the parachute automatically
for you. Once out of the plane and
with your canopy fully inflated you
have a good two minutes of floating
gently down, admiring the scenery,
being directed by radio to the
landing spot and generally relaxing.
It's an excellent feeling!
Everybody managed to reach the
ground. The odd one managed to
land in a tree (didn't you Simon) of
which there are only two in the land
area of 45 acres!! Two other people
couldn't be bothered to walk the 800
metres from the landing field back
to the hangars, so they landed a bit
closer. One of them guided their
parachute neatly between two rows
of parked aircraft! The other landed
in the spectators paddock.
Parachuting is an excellent sport.
The initial outlay is quite a lot at £65 H \ Fll Club
but this includes all the training and
the first jump. Subsequent jumps
are only £12 and student members
of the club receive a subsidy on this.
If you're interested in doing a
jump, contact Wendy Mclnerney,
Chem Eng 4, Helen Richardson,
Chem Eng 4, or come along and see
them in the UDH any Monday at
12.30pm.
Full Metal Jacket is next Thursday's
Filmsoc presentation. Directed by
Stanley Kubrik, who gave us the
classic 2001, it has been critically
acclaimed as the best war movie
ever made. The story comes in two
distinct halves, firstly the training,
the bit of the film which spawned
the unlikely hit single I Want to be
Your Drill Instructor. And secondly,
the actual Vietnam war action, shot
in a former gas works in London. It
is disturbing, even frightening in its
realism and quite unlike any war
film I've seen before, a remarkable
film you won't easily forget. Details
are in What's On.

Sibelius
Jean Sibelius was born in a small
town in Finland and hence became
a world famous rally driver. He is
perhaps best remembered for his
ability to compose music whilst
driving. Many of his greatest works
were written whilst competing,
including 'Karelia Suite', written on
a special stage of the RAC rally, and
perhaps his most famous work,
Finlandia composed whilst
competing, successfully in the One
Thousand Lakes Tour of Finland.
Tonight, at 8pm in the Great Hall,
Imperial College Symphony
Orchestra will perform Sibelius'
Violin Concerto, arguably the most
difficult in the repertoire (composed
during the most difficult rally, Paris-
Dakar). The soloist is Geoffrey
Silver, former leader of the National
Youth Orchestra of Great Britain
and a secondyear maths student at
IC. Geoffrey has never competed in
a rally, although, he was born in
Carshalton, Surrey.
Also on tonight's programme are
Elgar's Symphony in A Flat and
Mussorgsky's Night on the Bare
Mountain.
Tickets are £2.50, £1.50 (students)
and £1.00 (in advance) and are
available from Orchestra members
or the Haldane Library.
Boxing Day
Wu Shu Kwan, the style practised
by the Imperial College Kung Fu
Club, is an extremely practical and
formidable street fighting-technique.
The Wu Shu Kwan Chinese Boxing
Association, which has branches all
over the world, has organised a
Freestyle Full-Contact
Championship in which senior
practitioners of the style fight one on
one. The actual fighting technique
is very similar to Thai Boxing,
combining normal boxing-punches
with kicking. The result is a fast and
furious fight which is exciting to
watch.
The tournament is to be held in
Surbiton, Surrey, on Sunday
December 11 at 2.00pm. Seats cost
£6 (a subsidy may be available), and
if there is enough interest a minibus
will be organised. For futher
information, please contact Steve
Murray (Mech Eng 2), Ali Abidi
(Elec Eng 2) or Warren Won (Elec
Eng 3).

Nerds
Have you ever had the unfortunate
experience of someone inflicting
themself upon you? Have you ever
been subjected to a being's presence
which is so annoying that visions of
hari kari flow through your mind
constantly? Have you ever had
someone wreck your life so
thoroughly that you thought the
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
had been embodied in one man and
had come to live with you?
If the answer to any of these
questions is yes, then you have at
some point been in contact with....a
nerd.
The Nerd by Larry Shue, was first
performed in the West End by
Rowan Atkinson in thetitlerole, the
show received rave reviews and was
awarded 'Best Comedy of the Year'
and 'Best Comedy Performance of
the Year' in the Laurence Olivier
awards in 1984. It packed out the
theatre for a year.
Dramsoc is proud to announce
that this hilarious, sidesplitting,
uproarious, bladder-bursting (and
other adjectives too numerous to
mention) show is the first
production of the year. It can be
seen in the Concert Hall at 7.30pm
from Tuesday December 6 to
Saturday December 10 at the
incredible, value for money prices
of:
Tuesday-Thursday £1.50
(concessions) and £2.00 (others)
Friday & Saturday £2.00 and
£2.50.

The Prisoner
General Pinochet rose to power,
due to the military coup on
September 111973. Since then there
have been 680 documented cases of
'disappearance' in Chile. Although
the true total may never be known.
Most of these 'disappearances'
means that people are abducted by
government agents, then any
knowledge of arrest or detention is
denied.
There have been many
testimonies by former prisoners, but
the discovery of the bodies of 52
'disappeared' in 1978 provided
irrefutable evidence that
government agents had arrested
and murdered these victims. In 1987
Judge Carlos Cerda Fernandez
brought chrages against 38 members
of the Armed Forces. Even so many
cases are left unresolved.
Amnesty International's two year
campaign about the 'disappeared'
hopes to raise public awareness and
to inform people of the ongoing
violations of humanrightsin Chile.
As part of this campaign there will
be a showing of a video entitled 'No
Olvidar' on November 29 at 5.30pm,
in the Brown Committee Room. The
video looks at one particular family,
5 members of which disappeared in
1973. If anyone would like any
further information contact Chris
Pote, Chem Eng 2.
