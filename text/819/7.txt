student grants in London, we found
it increasingly difficult to create
original and appetising menus from
these ingredients. The only
alleviation to this diet came from the
apricots that grew so abundantly in
the area and the occasional purchase
of an anorexic chicken from a local.
Morale hit a particularly low ebb
when we discovered that the small
yellow lumps in our porridge were
not flakes from the husk, but were
actually small worms! We soon
dropped porridge from our culinary
repertoire.
After 25 days of interviews and
questionnaires, we finished the
survey and headed north to Hushe.
We had left ourselves almost 3
weeks for the climbing part of the
expedition, and, with the help of

Pakistan
Getting there—By air to Karachi
costs approximately £350 (by Gulf
Air), to Islamabad £650 (BA and
PIA). Travel Agents can sometimes
find cheaperflightsbut they will not
be direct. Book a seat early for your
return journey to England towards
the end of August and in September
as this is the busiest time of the year.
Remember to keep PR250 for airport
tax as you leave the country.
Overland is difficult, as it involves
travel in Iran, but it is not
impossible. Afghanistan's borders
are still closed.
Visa—A 6-month tourist visa costs
£30 from the Embassy of Pakistan,
35 Lowndes Square, London SW1X,
and will usually take 24 hours to be
issued. Currency £1 = PR30
(Pakistani Rupees). You can only
take PR100 into the country. Take
US$ cash and travellers cheques but
note that in remote areas, they will
not change TCs and sometimes no
banks exist at all.
Health—Vaccinations needed for
Cholera, Typhoid, Tetanus, Rabies,
Tuberculosis and Polio. Both types
of Malaria tablets are also necessary.
two porters, made off into the
mountains. Our trek took us past
the lofty likes of Mashebrim,
Chogolisa, K-6 and K-7, though we
were more modest in our climbing
capabilities, and saved our energy
for a successful attempt on the
19,000ft Gondorro Peak.
As we returned to Islamabad by
plane, we enjcved fantastic views of
the Karakoram. K2, Broad Peak &
Nanga Parbat were just a few of the
peaks that we recognised. To
celebrate the end of the expedition,
the chief engineer of PCAT took us
out for an excellent dinner in the
heart of Islamabad. A larger official
reception had had to be cancelled
because all the government officials
were observing 10 days mourning
over the death of General Zia.
Drink only purified water or bottled
soft drinks. Baltistan has its own
specific hazards: Giardia is a
microscopic parasite that lives in the
dusty atmosphere and will strike
you down with the runs and cause
fits of bad-egg tasting burps; the
thinner atmosphere in the
mountains can lead to altitude
sickness, which can only be cured
by rapid descent; and sunburn,
which can be avoided by adequate
protection.
Transport in Pakistan—Cheap,
uncomfortable buses run frequently
all over the place. Usually 24 hours
booking is needed. Trains exist on
the lowlands, but are often booked
up for weeks in advance. Internal
flights are reasonable eg. Karachi to
Islamabad via 'The Night Coach' is
£30 single and Islamabad to Skardu
is only £10 single, though this can
be booked up over a month in
advance, and its running depends
heavily on the weather.
Accommodation—Any class to
suit every pocket:
Food—Chillis with everything!

Are you an Explorer?
After reading this account of the
Baltistan Energy Survey Expedition,
would you still like to take part in
a similar project? Another
expedition is planned for the
summer of 1989, with similar
objectives to this year's venture. The
party of 8 people will come from
different colleges of the University
of London, selected in groups of
twos. Members of each pair should
get on well with each other, have
done some independent travelling
before and be able to cope with the
unexpected. Send your personal
details together, and include a short
list of previous experience and how
you would contribute to this
expedition, to:
Dominic Strowbridge,

Engineering,
Imperial College.
Expedition Presentation
We will be giving a presentation
about the expedition on Tuesday
November 29, at 1.15pm, in lecture
theatre 342 in the Mechanical
Engineering Department.
Everyone is welcome especially if
you are interested in applying for
a place on next Summers
proposed expedition, or if you
are just curious.
