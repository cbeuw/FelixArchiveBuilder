Felix
Editorial
The FELIX dinner's jolly good
They give you lots of yummy food.
A man is coming from the press
To tell us what an awful mess
The papers have become of late
Whilst stuffing his face
And filling his plate.
So come along on December 9,
Ask in the FELIX Office any time!
Evelyn Gardens. A second ceiling
has fallen down in Evelyn Gardens.
The Managing Survey of
Residences, Mr Peter Hallworth
claims that it fell down because of
dampness caused by students
overfilling their baths or having
showers with the curtains open. Pull
the other one Peter.
Mathematics. Felix has received a
number of letters from the
Mathematics Department
complaining about the contents of
an editorial two weeks ago and a
news story last week. I think it
would be sensible to withold
comment until I have had the
opportunity to discuss the matter
with the authors of some of the
letters. However, on the subject of
the editorial let me point out that I
have recieved no new information
- aside from blanket denials and
demands for retraction - since the
editorial was published.
Consequently I have had no reason
to change my opinions on the
matter. I accept, however, that the
Maths department is entitled to
express its own opinions on the
issue.
I am sure our readers are
intelligent enough to make up their
own minds.
Apathy. It is ironic that FELIX has
not recieved any comments on the
subject of the Alternative Prospectus
which, after all was the issue at
stake in the disputed editorial. It is
sobering to realise that students and
staff show no interest in issues
which should be seen to be
important. They are far more
interested in technicalities and
defending themselves against minor
criticism than they are in issues such
as the future of Imperial College or
student loans.

Council
S k e t c h
In an attempt to prove just how
wacky students can be it was
decided to hold Monday's Council
on a boat moored on the
Embankment. The boat, a heap of
rust aptly named 'The President'
had never before experienced
anything quite so tedious.
The President's report opened
with discussions on rent levels.
Now tht College's Finance and
Executive Committee have decided
to donate £50,000 wardens 'national
rents to the residence account. Hon
Sec Wendy Morris intends to Wimp
out of the Union rent strike in the
event of College not diverting funds
from foreign students into
accommodation.
The meeting passed on to
criticising Christine Taig (Union
President two years ago) for tying
the Union into a rent agreement that
now seems ludicrous. A motion was
finally passed recommending to
College that Montpelier Hall be sold
for at least £5M, with the money
being used partly to purchase a
cheaper, new hall for more students
and partly to reduce the Fisher Hall
mortgage. Unfortunately recent bids
for Montpelier Hall have not much
exceeded £4M.
Good news at last; the Astroturf
pitch at Harlington has been
approved by College. Better news;
President Nigel Baker has been
instructed to try and get an
agreement out of College as to
exactly who owns what at
Harlington and the Boat House and,
more importantly, exactly who the
proceeds of the Harlington Gravel
Trust belong to. He seems to have
forgotten that the whole thing was
investigated by Sydney Harbour-
Bridge last year. Congratulations to
Nigel if he ever gets College to sign
anything concrete on this issue.
Calls for support, or otherwise, for
the ULU shutdowns to protest
against the Poll Tax and DES Union
survey were rapidly abandoned as
irrelevant when Jelly pointed out
that the Poll Tax protest was in the
middle of the Easter vacation. GUC
delegates were mandated to point
this out to the rest of GUC, as they
obviously hadn't noticed. Tom
Yates, SCC Chairman, proposed
that as a positive alternative we
should hold a 'Stop the Poll Tax
Carnival' and a 'Stuff the DES
Survey Carnival' (names courtesy of
Jelly). Council are always loath to
pass up the opportunity for a party,
so watch out for the Chance to both
enjoy yourself and be politically
'right on'.
and a 'state of your liver' testing
machine. All Council members have
been mandated to use the latter, so
you will probably have the pleasure
of watching Union hacks fainting in
the Bar as they realise they are going
to die in three days time. There were
also calls for RCS President Steph
Snell to use the machine last, as she
would probably break it. A motion
calling for all Council members to
abstain entirely during the Week
was, strangely enough, defeated by
a large majority.
Deputy President Chas Brereton
(decorated for services to
deforestation) presented a
mercifully brief report. The only
contentious issue was this desire to
clarify whether Sabbaticals can take
time off during term time to pursue
club activities or work part-time (eg
playing the piano). For the sake of
pianos everywhere, Mr Brereton
should be told the answer is No.
A verbal addition to Wendy's
report was his view on non-
attendance at Human Rights Week
Committees. He pointed out that
the Week was conceived by
someone with a 'less than realistic
view of the world'. As this person
is now in Peru, Council felt safe to
scrap the Week for this year.
During discussion of a new House
Committee constitution, it was
pointed out that under the wording
presented, each call of 'quorum'
would halve the membership of the
Committee. House Committee
Chairman Adrian Hicks conceded
this was a 'mistake'.
And so, at last, to the motions.
During the motion on investigating
the formation of a Union playgroup,
a rumour circulated that the
investigation was to be reported
back on March 20th because Fi
Nicholas is expecting shortly after
that.
SCC caused a stir by submitting
a motion advocating clubs holding
personal bank accounts containing
Union money. The vision of club
chairmen and treasurers treating
themselves to dinner at the Savoy
every year (a privilege confined to
the Industrial Society) was enough
to make the great and exalted of the
Union throw the motion out.
In another motion, Nigel and
Chas were mandated to read the
White Paper on Student Top-up
Loans. Nigel only had two
questions: 'How thick is it?' and
'Who actually has to go and buy it
from HMSO in Holborn?' Why not
treat yourself, Nigel, and do it
yourself.
The best slanging match of
Council was saved until the end.
Nigel brought a motion of No
Confidence in Sydney Harbour-
Bridge (name changed in aid of
Comic Relief) as Council's
representative to Governing Body
and Finance and Executive (the two
highest College committees). This
was because Syd had missed F&E
last Friday when his alarm clock
failed to go off. After Syd's
passionate defence, Nigel was the
only person supporting his motion.
Most of the rest of Council actively
voted against.
And so, the myth of Union
democracy lives on.
