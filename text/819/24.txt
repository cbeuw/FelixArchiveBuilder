DO HAVE some resources to make
a reasonable offer.'
'They say they can't afford much
but propose to offer even less,' said
AUT General Secretary, Diana
Warwick, speaking on the AUP's
refusal to make a pay offer.
The IC branch of the AUT was
unable to comment on the issue
yesterday, since the union's
committee had not met to discuss
the issue for release to the press.
The union is holding a meeting next
Thursday, at which IC Union
President, Nigel Baker is to speak
for the Students' Union.
Mr Baker now plans to take a
motion to the Students' Union
General Meeting next Tuesday, to

dispute.

debate
IC Debating Society presented the
first of two speeches on 'The Future
for South Africa' yesterday.
During the presentation Cedric
Mayson, representing the African
National Congress, described his
vision of a non-racial future which
he believes will occur in his lifetime.
Mr Mayson became a 'banned
person' in his country for his
friendship with ANC members. He
was charged with High Treason in
1983 and now lives in exile.
He believes 80% of South Africans
want to live in a united and
democratic society and claims
Apaitheid is maintained for an
economic advantage by the white
community, and not because of any
racial dogma.
He answered questions on the
Freedom of Charter of 1955, the
policy document held by all anti-
apartheid organisations. Mr Mayson
stated that many of the opinions
held by Britains were the result of
unconscious racism, particularly the
lack of support for sanctions against
South Africa.
Jan Castlyn from the South
African Embassy will address the
same question next week.
A ceiling collapsed in Evelynj
Gardens' Southwell House early'
this week.
The occupant of the room was in
the bathroom when a five foot

Managing Surveyor of Residences
Peter Hallworth insisted that there
was no danger to students living in
Evelyn Gardens. He said that the
ceilings frequently collapsed when
students used showers without
drawing the curtains or filled baths

Hallworth went on to say that there
were no plans to reappraise the

caught with forged Union cards
during a failed Mascotry attempt at
a Royal School of Mines Union
General Meeting on Monday
lunchtime. The IC Union executive
will be meeting on Tuesday to
decide what action to take over the
forgeries.
The UGM was gate crashed by
nine members of the RCS who
posed as Mining students in an
attempt to steal the Mines Mascot,
Davy. The students were recognised
as not belonging to the RSM and
were detained whilst the Mines
mascot was carried to safety. Five of
the students were found to be
carrying forged Union Cards.
RCS Vice President, Dave
Williams told FELIX that the forged
cards had been nbotocopied on a

newspaper resigned last week after
the Editorial Board 'expressed
disgust about her performance',
according to an LS spokesman
yesterday.
The Board felt that the editorship
of the newspaper should be
questionned before a forum but
Editor Jane Headon resigned before
safety of the ceilings in Evelyn
Gardens.
"There is no problem with the
buildings' he said.
Southwell House Warden, Ken
Young, told FELIX T think it's about
time it was given less flippant
consideration'. He pointed out that
previous ceiling collapses were not
the result of dampness and'
explained that the buildings 'should
be sound enough' to cope with
leaking baths and showers.
Mr Hallworth now intends to
replace the shower curtains b)
sealing doors, but says he can do-
nothing about the problems which
arise when baths overflow.
"The reason for the problem is the
abuse of facilities' he said, 'if
students don't abuse the facilities
they have no need to worry'.

Rag
This year's Rag Week has raised
over £7500, according to Rag
Chairman, Fiona Nicholas. The
figure is considerably less than last
year's total of £10,500.
Miss Nicholas said that the main
reason for the fall was the Careers
Fair's clash with Rag Week , for
which a £500 compensation fee is to
be paid to Rag. She also blamed the
loss of Chas Brereton's Piano
Marathon this year. In the past, Mr
Brereton's 24 hour Piano Marathon
has raised over £1500 for charity
during Rag Week.

phone number was given as the
