Gutter
Brothers
After the excitement of Rag Week
dies down, what else is there to
entertain you around College?
Hopefully, by now, you'll have
seen the publicity around for The
Gutter Brothers. If not, then let me
say that they're playing tonight
(Friday 25th November) in the
Union Lounge. Not only that, but
there's a disco and a bar extension
till 12.
The band are based in London
and play excellent R&B skiffle music
(this includes the washboards).
They are, at present, riding high
after completing a very successful
tour of the States, and after
numerous appearances on Night
Network and other TV slots.
They are one of the best live bands
around and absolutely not to be
missed.
Doors open at 9pm tonight and
you can get tickets in advance for
£1.50 from the Union Office or the
Union Snack Bar, or on the door for
a mere £2. Ents card holders pay just
£1.
SQUASH
RHBNC
Squashed
Our newly sponsored squash teams
(by Goudie Squash International)
won convincingly against RHBNC
in the UAU on Wednesday. The
men won 4-1 and the women won
5-0.
The only person out of the men's
team to lose was the number 1,
Craig Robinson (despite doctor's
orders not to play due to a back
injury), other team members feel it
had more to do with Union Bar
food, encountered after last week's
match. Ming Tan (2) won
convincingly 3-0 against a stroppy
opponent who encountered firm
refereeing from Lewis Lenssen.
Lewis himself (5) won with
embarrassing ease. Club captain Ian
Mercer (4) foxtrotted his opponent
to a simple 3-0 victory whilst
Rustom Khumbatta played very
nicely and won 3-0.
For a change, the ladies had a
leisurely 'Sunday Afternoon' match
against a team who looked like they
had that 'Sunday Morning' feeling.
The ladies lost only 12 points
between them. A convincing 135 to
12 points victory. Obviously the nice
Goudie kit put their opponents
(stomachs ?) off.
BOAT
Fours
Head
Last Saturday was the Head of the
River race for fours, which is one of
the biggest events in the winter
racing calendar, attracting 500 crews
from across the country. IC Boat
Club had a large entry this year with
12 crews competing at all levels from
novice to elite. The results speak for
themselves—IC was the only club to
win three pennants—the novice
coxed, the Sen II coxed and Sen I
coxless fours. The overall results
were excellent both by the winning
crews and the others who narrowly
missed out in their divisions.
Hopefully, this is a pointer to a
successful season.
