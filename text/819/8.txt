Now that winter is closing in on us,
1 thought it would be appropriate to
write about energy. Several aspects
of this subject appear in the news
from time to time;. unfortunately
there isn't room to go very far here.
Production
About 90% of the world's energy
needs are met by combustion of
fossil fuels; the rest comes mainly
from nuclear and also hydroelectric
sources. Production and sale of
Ninety percent of the
world's energy needs
are met by fossil fuels
energy is big business and is vital to
all nations' economies. It is no
surprise to find that most developed
countries have large resources of
energy, and most underdeveloped
countries do not. There are some
significant exceptions, particularly
Japan, which is very short in energy
resources. In Britain the importance
of energy can be seen from the large
balance of trade surplus produced
by the oil industry - about £7 billion
and the sales per year by British
Coal (£4 billion), British Gas (£7
billion) and the CEGB (£5 billion).
Whenever the world price of oil
increases significantly, everyone
gets very worried about the
impending energy crisis and what
they will do when the oil runs out.
These worries evaporate when the
price of oil falls again, as we have
seen in the last few years, and
everyone shelves their plans for
producing oil from coal, etc. There
are probably reserves of oil easily
sufficient for our lifetimes, but the
time will come when it is cheaper to
use coal than extract the oil from
increasingly difficult reserves.
Pollution
No form of energy is totally 'clean'.
The cleanest fuel is probably natural
gas, but even that produces carbon
dioxide on combustion, with its
consequences for the 'greenhouse'
effect. Oil and coal produce even
more C 0 2 for their energy output,
and coal especially produces a lot of
sulphur dioxide, a significant
contributor to acid rain. All fossil
fuels when burnt also produce
nitrogen oxides, but this depends
more on the method of combustion
than on the fuel. Nuclear energy
produces no atmospheric pollution,
but instead, of course, produces
radioactive material. We could make
a significant reduction in carbon
dioxide emissions by replacing all
our fossil fuel energy supply by
nuclear power stations, but the cost
would be prohibitive and the
increased risk associated with the
increased capacity may be
unacceptable.
Renewable Energy
So what about 'alternative' energy
resources? The quantity of solar
radiation incident on the earth is
phenomenal, but it is very thinly
distributed, as are all renewable
resources. For example, the annual
average solar energy in Britain is just
O.lkW per square metre. Or to
replace just one nuclear power
station, we would need 150 square
kilometres of solar panels. A similar
energy production from wind
power would require 300 sixty-
metre wind turbines in an area the
size of Birmingham. Renewable
resources also tend to be somewhat
unreliable. However, some
renewable energy resources are very
viable, for example hydroelectric
schemes. These generally require
huge capital investment, but will
run very cheaply for years. Some
schemes have been very successful
and some disastrous (eg in Brazil,
FELIX 814).
Efficiency
We could do a lot to conserve our
energy resources and reduce
pollution by using energy more
efficiently. This entails both
reducing requirements for heat in
industry and houses, and
recovering the heat released by
combustion more efficiently. It is
often pointed out that the
generation of electricity is very
wasteful of energy, because for
every unit of electricity produced,
something like 1.5 units of heat is
thrown away. Schemes to recover
No form of energy is
totally clean
this heat, eg in district heating
schemes, have usually not been
very successful. However, since
electricity can be used much more
efficiently, the overall energy
consumption may be quite good.
For example, electric trains
compared to diesel trains,
microwave ovens compared to gas
ovens, electric lights compared to
candles, etc. Many advances have
been made in recent years in the
efficiency of combustion systems
and in the transfer of this energy,
largely prompted by oil price rises
in the 1970s. On the domestic scene,
the introduction of natural gas
allowed a huge increase in the
number of homes with central
heating, with hardly any total
increase in energy consumption,
because of the increased efficiency

of gas boilers, compared to the coal
fires they :argely replaced. Even so,
gas boilers are only up to 75%
efficient, so a quarter of the gas vou
use is still wasted. Recent
experiments on the old Ascot water
heater in my kitchen showed it to
be about 12% efficient.
Improvements to boiler efficiency
are constantly being investigated by
British Gas, with features such as
condensing the water vapour from
the flue gases to recover the latent
heat. This is easy with the relatively
clean flames from gas, but much
more difficult with flue gases from
coal. Both the efficiency and
pollution emission of oil and coal
fired systems can be improved by
adding water to the fuel. In the case
of oil, up to 20% water can be
added; the water helps the oil break
into smaller droplets, so improving
mixing with air, it provides a source
of O H radicals for the combustion
reactions, and it lowers the flame
temperature, reducing the
production of nitrogen oxides.
Adding water to coal is not the only
way of improving its combustion
efficiency. British Coal are doing a
lot of research into fluidised bed
combustors. (Coal is ground into
small particles and burnt in a
vertically fast-moving stream of air.)
These have the advantage of being
much smaller than conventional
A quarter of the gas
you use is wasted
combustors and because of the
increased turbulence and mixing of
the coal and air, the combustion and
the heat transfer to the steam pipes
is more efficient. Another British
Coal project is coal gasification for
power generation. Here the coal is
gasified, the gas is burnt, passed
through a gas turbine to generate
electricity and then preheats steam
which is passed through a fluidised
bed combustor where the rest of the
coal is burnt to produce steam for
a conventional steam turbine.The
feasibility of a 2000MW power
station using this technology is
being investigated by British Coal.
