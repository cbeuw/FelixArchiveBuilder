During the summer of ly
SS, the
P tistan Energy Survi y Expedition
travelled to the town of Khaplu, in
the Northern Areas
where- it conducted a s
sources and uses
energy. We questioned local
inhabitants on the types and
quantities of fuels used for activities
such as cooking, heating and
lighting. The aim of the survey was
to point to alternative energy
resources that the population would
readily accept in order to improve
their quality of life and stop further
deforestation in the area.
At the beginning of the 1987
academic year Henry Sullivan and
I, both Mechanical Engineers at IC,
decided that we wanted to make use
of our fledgling Bai^earing skills in
conducting a technology survey in
a remote and mountainous region
of the world. With this idea in mind,
we recruited two Physicists, Lynn
Hughes and Phil Startin, and
together we began to develop a
plan.
Our initial hope to visit Bhutan fell
through because of the exorbitant
tariffs imposed by the Bhutanese on
foreign visitors. Instead we chose
Baltistan, as it fulfilled the two main
criteria for the expedition. Firstly,
development agencies were already
working in the area and the
expedition could collaborate with
these on a survey. Secondly, the
region is dominated by the greatest
concentration of the world's highest
mountains—the Karakoram range of
the Himalaya.

Over eight months were spent
raising the necessary sponsorship
for the expedition, planning the
survey and liaising with the
Pakistan Council of Appropriate
Technology (PCAT) and the Aga
Khan Rural Support Programme
(AKRSP), the development agencies
we arranged to work with. On
July 5th the expedition left
Heathrou at the beginning of its
long |oumey to Baltistan. and the
town of Khaplu.
The first culture shock wave hit us
as we stepped off the plane at
Karachi airport. Pakistan's largest
city was a feast for all the senses: the
mixture of colours, noises and
smells were a dramatic introduction
to this country. We soon exchanged
these surroundings for the interior
of a bus and a 32 hour drive to the
capital Islamabad.
In Islamabad, we met the
Chairman of PCAT, a high ranking
government official, who
enthusiastically endorsed our work,
and assigned one of his field officers
to help us during the survey. We
were also received by H M
Ambassador, who turned out to be
an ex-governor of Imperial College.
The next leg of the journey to
Skardu, the capital of Baltistan,
involved another 28 hours on buses;
6 of them spent on a small roof rack
and shared with a rather fierce
looking goat.
Baltistan was very different to the
lowlands of Pakistan. Here, the
people lacked the materia
possessions or amenities of then
countrymen down south, but
seemed to have a more hardy and
independent character that came
from surviving the harsh mountain
climate. Their facial features bore
much resemblance to their Tibetan
ancestors who brought Buddhism to
the area between the 4th and 7th
centuries, though now the
population has almost entirely
converted to Shia Islam. Their
unquestioning bond to the Muslirr

taith explains the different roles ot
men and women in their society:
men generally sit about all day in the
bazaars, drinking tea and
'gupshupping', or gossiping, while
the women do the cooking, tend the
fields and bring up the children. As
a result, only the boys go to school
regularly, whereas the girls will be
kept at home to help their mothers.
These roles only look unfair through
the eyes of foreigners who have had
a Christian dominated upbringing.
Only the most liberated Baltis find
fault with their system.
We spent three days buying last
minute supplies in the large bazaar
at Skardu, and arranging a timetable
for our survey with the local AKRSP
officials before travelling another
100km eastwards, by jeep, to
Khaplu. Here, our home and base
was the Khaplu Government Rest
House, a one storey stone and
cement building situated down by
the river Shyok. The four of us
shared one room, two beds and an
odd assortment of chairs. The latter
were strung together to form two
more rather uncomfortable,
makeshift beds and a strict rota u as
enforced so that we all had our fai r
share of sleepless nights.
We started the survey as soon a
possible. Unfortunately, PCAT ha•!

a different language to the rest of
Pakistan, so their appointment of

ladies of the house were hurriedly
ushered out of sight. We would
then be shown into the best room
of the house, to be greettd by the
head of the household. A typical
interview would take between a half
