Who Framed Henceforward
Roger Rabbit
Cert PG, Odeon Leicester Square
From December 2.
Take one of the world's best
producers, Steven Spielberg, and
directors, Robert Zemeckis; give
them 740 additional technical staff,
the backing of Disney's Touchstone
Pictures, and over £20 million; add
a couple of the finest actors around,
Bob Hoskins and Christopher
Lloyd, and every Disney and
W a r n e r cartoon character
imaginable.
The result is Who Framed Roger
Rabbit, as dazzling and entertaining
as anv other film you can name. It
opens with Roger co-starring in a
cartoon with Baby Herman ('I've got
the sex drive of a fifty year old and
the dinky of a three year old'),
chasing around the unfeasibly large
kitchen of a typical cartoon house.
The film is spoilt by Roger's acting
though, the director calls cut and a
stunning transformation to the real
w o r l d occurs. The effect is
spectacular and a taster for the
following one hundred minutes'
journey around Hollywood and
Toontown.
Eddie Valiant (Hoskins), a local
g u m s h o e , is hired to obtain
evidence proving the infidelity of
Roger's wife Jessica ('I'm not really
this bad—it's just the way I'm
drawn'). H e takes pictures of Jessica
indulging in a game of patta-cake
w i t h M a r v i n A c m e , a local
businessman, and these are shown
to Roger in the hope that it will
straighten him up and improve his
acting.
When Acme is found dead, Roger
becomes prime suspect. Eddie
W h o could live with a man who
tape records you every time you
take a pee, and styles the sounds of
sex into steamy synclavier
"'mphonies? That man is Jerome
'">v Ian McKellen) the semi-
successtul musical innovator who's
struggle out of lean times in love,
life and work forms the theme of
Ayckbourn's latest play.
Candidates for his partner would
have to be pretty eccentric, just a
little kinky or plain inhuman. The
artist has to settle for the latter in the
shape of NAN300F the demented
domestic dalek passed on by 'the
man down the hall' because his wife
has long since departed their
bugged boudoir, taking their only
daughter, and all his inspiration,
with her.
Jerome's scheming to win back
daddv's favourite girl by passing off
his chaotic existence as a picture of
homely tranquility, with the aid of
naive escort girl and aspiring actress
Zoe, is funny in itself, and lays
down jigsaw-cut foundations for
scenes of absolute hilarity in the
second act. Here we see the lawyer,
the wife and child, Jerome and his
new found perfect partner (?!)
engaged in classic Avckbourn farce.
winds up trying to prove his
innocence, and quickly regrets the
decision. They are aided by Delores,
Valiant's foolish lover, and begin a
hopeless search for truth and
justice. Close behind is Judge Doom
(Lloyd), marvellously created as a
purely evil creature and
convincingly played. The scene is
set, the chase is on.
The details of the plot I found not
just confusing but pretty
unfathomable. It all gets explained
at the end, the whos and whys, and
makes a strong social comment in a
strangely amusing way. The film
loses nothing for this complication
however. It's about having fun.
When Eddie reprimands Roger for
showing off in public while he's
supposed to be in hiding he justifies
it with a line which summarises the
entire move. 'It's alright, 1 made
them laugh. It's important to have
a laugh. Sometimes a laugh is the
only w e a p o n we h a v e . ' A
wonderful philosophy.
Maturity is not about being
serious. It's knowing when to be
serious, and when to revert to
childhood. I can say unashamedly,
I sat in a cinema full of kids, knee-
high to Roger himself mostly, and
laughed with them at the funny little
cartoon characters racing across the
screen. The sheer technical brilliance
was enough to fill me with awe and
a childhood passion I've not felt for
a good many years. I loved every
last second.
Who Framed Roger Rabbit is going
to be the blockbuster movie of the
year and I can think of nobody who
wouldn't enjoy it. Be sure to catch
it and see what I mean.

'You do what like a rabbit?'
This tempting invitation to peek
in at the creative artist at work could
easily be siezed on as an
opportunity to interpret the work as
autobiographical. The artist-as-
voyeur metaphor fits perfectly, of
course to Ayckbourn's own craft of
playwright, >ut is broad enough to
stand for many creative disciplines.
The potential pitfalls of choosing
this subject must alwavs be self-
indulgence and conceit on the part
of the writer yielding a mythical
master-artiste surrounded by stage-
prop supporting characters, thus
providing a rather crude device for
focussing our attention on the
central character.
Indeed McKellen might almost be
the author, trapped in the middle of
a maypole dance of his own cut-out
characters strangely comes to life.
Unusual economy of detail for these
characters leaves us with a Sloane
Ranger, an ageing hippy, a City
slicker, a bunch of brash brats and,
only moderately less human, the
robot.
Thankfully Jane Asher brings
abundant humanity to her role as
the estranged wife, almost enough
in fact to offer c o n v i n c i n g
competition to her husband's
constant companion and lover; his
art.
Setting the artist's 'pad' in the
anarchic bedlam of a 'rough streets'
district together with a disparaging
reference to K i l b u r n draws a
paranoid middle-class chortle at the
'urban jungle' cliche, but the net
effect is to add harmlessly to the
'cred' of our bohemian artist.
Audio-visually, however, all credit
to the designers of the moody set
and to Yasmin Hasmi and Paul
Todd's musical backbone to the
work.
In the end the sentimental shoot
of a finale springs to suddenly,
sucking emotional sap from a half
prepared and shallow soil. The
contrast of this slow seduction and
rapid climax is strangely post-
ecstatic and ultimately a little
unsatisfying.
To an understanding of its two
themes of love and creativity the
play contributes little, but it uses
them to good comic effect. The
result is not enlightenment, to be
sure, but it is something more than
the word entertainment has come to
mean. In the best sense of that word
Henceforward succeeds, like all good
theatre, in striking out into the stalls
insisting, with its live presence, that
it involves, even moves you. So
allow yourself that luxury and go
and see it: the after-dinner
conversation from th.s one will be
light enough not to spoil your post-
theatre Vindaloo.
