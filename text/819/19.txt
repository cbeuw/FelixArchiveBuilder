6 Cheers
IC 1st XI-2
Mill Hill 1st XI-1
The first XI took the pitch adopting,
with Mark Lewis, a 'Libero'
sweeper system. The entirely new
formation consisted of a couple of
players promoted from the 2nd
team. From the push back, Imperial
took control of the midfield with
Andy Lewis and Mark Rayfield
coming forward at every
opportunity from defence, the game
being played in Mill Hill's half. After
sustained pressure, Imperial scored
from a penalty short corner, through
Gary Knaresborough. After several
other opportunities for Paul
Skipworth had gone begging, Mill
Hill put the pressure back on
Imperial by scoring minutes before
half-time. In the second half IC
played their own inimitable brand
of happy hockey. Mill Hill were
outclassed in every department and
were unable to maintain any
possession. Paul Skipworth partially
redeemed himself when M Rayfield
constructed an easy scoring
opportunity for him. One umpire
blew for full-time and captain Hari
Vadadevan offered 3 cheers for the
opposition. The other umpire then
added some extra time and IC were
forced to resume their domination.
The final whistle then blew, 6 cheers
for the opposition.
BADMINTON
Home win
On Wednesday we played a U A U
match at home versus Kent. Men's
I found it incredibly easy due to the
fact that the Kent men's didn't turn
up. Men's II also found it incredibly
easy due to the fact that despite
Kent actually producing a team they
didn't provide any opposition. The
ladies team had injury problems and
were forced to concede most of the
games and therefore the match 7-2.
This weekend we entered twelve
people in the Hammersmith
individuals. Everyone played well
and we had a few notable successes.
In the men's doubles 'Kid' Kiernick
and 'Boy' Bartle having come
second in their group lost to
'Grandad' Hughes and Steven
Baddley (oops! I mean Mike
Bradley) in the semi-finals 21-10.
'Grandad' and Mike then went on
to win the final 15-5, 15-9. In the
mixed 'Grandad' and 'Flo-Jo'
Cohen got to the semi-finals after
winning their group and lost closely
to 'Captain Boo Boo' and Nisha
Ghelani 21-17.

LADIES H O C K E Y
UAU Success
IC lsts—1
Kings lsts—1
IC lsts—3
RHBNC—1
Despite an influx of high class
players, IC ladies have had a tough
start to the season. In the UAU and
UL League Premier Division,
halfway through term, they had
failed to win a game. A goal against
Kings College by Meriel Jones last
Saturday earned a draw and, more
importantly, a boost in confidence,
Wednesday brought a visit from
Royal Holloway in the U A U .
Always one of the strongest ladies
sides in London Holloway beat IC
16-0 last year. Not surprisingly, IC
entered the game with some
trepidation, but also a lot of
determination. From the outset IC
played the more skillful team
hockey. Debbie Tucker and Sam
Spence soon took command of the
midfield, allowing Lisa Preedy and
Gail Barnett to combine well when
attacking down the right.
Aggressive stopping and tackling by
Captain Alison Seward ensured that
IC played much of the game inside
• the Holloway '25'. Di Thomas
[finally provided the much deserved
breakthrough with a determined
individual run and shot before half-
itime. In the second half Emma
Pownell had to hold the defence
firm against a renewed Holloway
attack before Alison Seward put the
game safe by getting on the end of
a Gail Barnett cross. Di Thomas'
second goal, made sure that
Holloway's late penalty flick goal
did not endanger IC's win.

Wazari
On Saturday November 19, the
Club competed i,i the Eighteenth
Portsmouth Invitation Karate
Tournament and won a large
number of medals and trophies
against tough opposition from clubs
all over Southern England despite
the absence of Maiken Engelstad
(3rd dan), the winner of last year's
Ladies Kata Competition.
In the Men's Individual Kata, Paul
Potter came a respectable 5th, but
any disappointment at not reaching
the finals must must have vanished
when he was later part of the 3 man
team which won the Team Kata
with a brilliant performance of
'Empi'. The synchronisation of the
Kata movements of our team
surpassed that of any of the others.
In the final of the Ladies 10th to
4th Kyu Kumite (fighting), Sari
Lindberg completely outclassed her
opponent in the final, quickly
scoring an 'uppon' with her 'Jodan
Mowashi-Geri' (kick to the head) to
win. There were also placings in
some of the other events. Kate
Taylor came second in the
Brown/Black Belt Ladies Individual
Kata and joint third in the Kumite.
Andy Kerley was runner-up in the
10th to 4th Kyu Mens Kumite losing
the final by a 'wazari' in a fight
which went the distance, and the
Mens Kumite Team were narrowly
defeated in the semi-final of their
category, losing by 3 wins to 2
despite looking set to win when 2-0
up at one stage.
SAILING
Match Report
Sunday morning saw IC sailing
team battling the elements in an
attempt to reach Queen Mary
reservoir for a match against the
City University.
On arrival at the reservoir we
discovered that there was quite a
breeze blowing, and 2 intrepid
members of the IC team ventured
onto the water to test the conditions.
After a few minor setbacks the two
teams were afloat and the serious
competition began. Some IC sailors
were slow to pick up the new
techniques needed to sail the
strange boats, resulting in some
spectacular acrobatics. However, we
put up a good fight and by the end
of the day the teams were roughly
level.
All in all, an enjoyable (if wet)
time was had by all.

Third Class
IC 3rd XI—2
RHBNC 3rd XI-0
IC 3rd XI—7
Bracknell 3A—1
Wednesday saw the 3rd XI's second
taste of U A U success with an
impressive win over the supposedly
strongest opposition in the division.
Although the ball was continuously
in the opposition half as IC piled on
the pressure, this pressure was
unrewarded aS the opposition
goalkeeper pulled off some good
saves. Ten minutes into the second
half IC spirits were raised when a
short corner was awarded and
Martin Grafer made no mistake with
a fierce drive to end RHBNC's
stubborn resistance. As the light
faded good work by Hansaan Majid
was rewarded when he struck from
close range to make it 2-0 and
shortly afterwards he came close to
making it 3-0.
A much depleted 3rd XI side
made it four wins in a row with a
spectacular win over some
genuinely good opposition. Indeed,
early on the opposition looked
extremely dangerous and
goalkeeper Robert Hunwick had to
do some good work. However, a
fine individual goal from Steven
Burton and good, solid defensive
work to thwart their efforts seemed
to break the opposition team and
the floodgates opened. Two more
goals from Steven Burton and one
from Vijay Thakur made it 4-0 at
half-time and by full-time Steven
Burton had scored 5 goals and Vijay
Thakur 2, to complete an amazing
afternoon.
