The Tom Tom
Club
The Borderline Club, just off!
Charing Cross Road is, let's face it, j
quite poxy. Spaghetti western
paraphenalia dripping from every:
surface, bandoliered girls
wandering around trying to sell you'
Tequila slammers and the occasional
bandito in the corner. The lighting
is poor, the stage small and the
records bad. It makes you feel like
you're in a North Mexican version
of Liverpool's old Cavern Club,
without the enjoyment. Despite this
the club has some good bands on,
like the Tom Tom Club.
The Tom Tom Club are the
husband (drummer) and wife
(bassist) team from Talking Heads,
and it shows. Their sound is as clear
and well produced as that of Byrne's
band with a different style. They are
funkier, more emphasis is on the
them but are more rock orientated,
beat and bass and they are also
extremely likeable. They don't try to
out cool you like most other
pretentious pop purveyors, they
simply show you their talent and
invite you to have fun, and that's
what you do.
Their music is brilliant but subtle.
To watch the guitarist (a David
Byrne—Norman Jardine lookalike)
you think he cannot be playing the
sounds which actually emerge, but
he is and his guitar gymnastics leave
his face unperturbed. Again with
the bass, about four notes emerge
from every pluck or fretting move,
we thought there must be a backing
track on the songs.
Towards the end they were joined
by Kirsty McColl (she was probably
just knocking around the club) and
did a cover of Velvet Underground's
Femme Fatal (you can forgive the
cliches when they're done well).
Also a bit predictable was the
rendition of Once in a Lifetime but so
what, it was excellent and this was
a unique show. j

Gothic Voices
Music was just getting started
around the time of the Crusades but
despite the lack of refinement and
technique the court minstrels could
still write a good tune and
Christopher Page has filled a gaping
hole in the classical repertoire with
recordings from the Middle Ages of
court and secular music by the
Gothic Voices.
Much of the music in this concert
was written around the time of the
coronation of Richard Coeur De
Lion, 800 years ago next year. It was
sung largely in the conducted form,
each part following the same note
the rough feel of War and Boy about
structure and beautifully performed
by the four voices, contralto and
three tenors. Light relief was
provided by Christopher Page the
non-conducting musical director
who introduced each piece with
contemporary writings from the,
period.
This year the Gothic Voices won
a Gramophone Magazine award for
their latest work, Music for the
Knights of the Garter and their finest
work to date," Music by Abbess
Hildegard of Bingen can be found in
the Haldane Library if you are
interested in hearing something just
a little bit different from Mozart or
Beethoven. *

U2
The much heralded album/film/
book of the tour by the current
darlings of the music world has
been added to the Haldane Library's
record collection. A chronicle of the
foshua Tree US Tour of 1987 it is a
mixture of live songs and new
material recorded in such hallowed
locations as Sun Studios, Memphis
where Elvis became the King.
Nothing could rival the success of
the foshua Tree and Unforgettable Fire
and so U2-have taken leave of those
styles to explore their 'true roots'.
Hence, guest stars include Bob
Dylan, co-writing and playing some
particularly insipid organ on Love
Rescue Me, and B B King provides
the highlight of the album with his
performance on When Love Comes To
Town. The new songs have some of
the rough feel of War and Boy about
them but are more rock orientated.
U2 claim them to be better songs,
but those who preferred the lack of
formal structure in early U2 will find
little here to comfort them.
Of the live stuff the covers, Helter
Skelter and AU Along the Watchtower
arefreneticand perhaps encapsulate
U2 live better than versions of Pride
and Bullet the Blue Sky which moved
me less than their originals. A
Gospel choir backing to Still Haven't
Found What I'm Looking For sounded
fun but made it dangerously like the
kind of Bible-bashing Gospel Rock
U2 have managed to sidestep
despite their Christianity.
So all credit to a band who refuse
' to rest upon their laurels and are
adventurous. I loved the whole
thing but in discovering their roots
they are moving away from their
origins and those who liked Boy may
not necessarily feel the same wajfc.
about the men.
