Robin Davison recounts the story of IC
Imperial College of Science and
Technology was founded by the
federation of three colleges in 1907.
Two of these, namely; Royal School
of Mines and Royal College of
Science had been associated since
1853.
The RCS has the oldest lineage
being founded as the College of
Chemistry in George Street,
Hanover Square in 1815. It became
the Royal College of Chemistry and
dedicated to the work of Sir
Humphrey Davy. It opened
accepting 50 students, said to be
'gentlemen of all ages, ranks and of
a variety of professions who follow
chemistry as a profession or as the
object of scientific taste'.
The RSM was founded as the
Government School of Mines and
Science Applied to the Arts in
Jermyn Street in 1851. It was part of
the Museum of Practical Geology
and the Geological Survey and its
first director was Henry Thomas De
la Beche. It became the Royal School
of Mines in 1863.
A Royal commission of 1870 set
up to inquire into 'Scientific
Instruction and the Advancement of
Science' recommended a move of
both Royal Colleges to South
Kensington. This was completed in
1872, to the first Huxley Building in
Exhibition Road. The building
remains standing today as the
Henry Cole wing of the V&A.
Laboratories were provided for the
instruction of Physics and Biology
and a chair of mathematics was
established and in 1881 the School
became the 'Normal School of
Science and Royal School of Mines
Its first Dean was T H Huxley who
was perhaps heir to the Prince
Consort's vision for Science and Art
teaching in South Kensington. The
circumstances of its foundation and
growth owe much to fears that
Britain would fall behind the
advanced technology of Germany
both industrially and militarily.
The name Normal School of
Science was devised as an analogy
to the Parisian Ecole Normale but
was unpopular and soon changed
to Royal College of Science.
The City and Guilds College was
founded,, because in 1876 the
Corporation and Livery Companies
of the City of London believed their
attention should be directed to the
promotion of technical education. In
1878 the City and Guilds Institute of
London was formed and established
the Finsbury Technical College.
The Institute moved to a site,
leased at peppercorn rent from the
1851 Commissioners, in Exhibition
Road. In December 1884 six
students enrolled—five men and
one woman.
The Royal College of Science building in Exhibition
Road, now part of the Victoria and Albert Museum
The 1851 Exhibition
Prince Albert, the Prince Consort,
had a vision for developing South
Kensington into an area devoted to
Science and Arts in 1849. By the
turn of the century the dream was
fulfilled and in South Kensington
stood; the Royal Albert Hall, The
Royal College of Art, the Royal
College of Music, the Natural
History Museum and, of course, the
Imperial College of Science and
Technology.
The idea of holding an 'Exhibition
of Works of Industry of All Nations'
came to Prince Albert as President
of the Royal Society of Arts in June
1849. It became the 'Great
Exhibition of 1851', arguably still the
greatest of its type to have been held
in Britain. It certainly made a
substantial profit, and the
centrepiece was 'The Crystal Palace'
erected in Hyde Park.
A Royal Commission of August
1850 had run the exhibition making
a profit of £186,000. A second
Supplementary Charter of 1851 gave
the body powers to dispose of this
surplus. The 'Commissioners for the
Exhibition of 1851' bought an area
of South Kensington on which
scientific and artistic societies could
locate themselves to 'extend their
influence upon productive
industry'.
At the direction of the Prince
Consort the Commissioner bought,
the irregularly-shaped 87 acres, at
£3,500 per acre, in 1854 with a loan
from Parliament. The land was
undeveloped country estate
belonging to several families and the
Smith's charity.
The Commissioners speculated
with the land and set up a 'Main
Square' bounded by Kensington,
Exhibition and Cromwell Roads,
and Prince Albert Road, now
Queen's Gate. The rest was
developed by private builders for
residential housing.
Sixteen and a half acres of land
were sold to Parliament for the
Natural History Museum in 1863,
which was not staited for a further
ten years. The Estate of the 1851
Commissioners was used for
exhibitions and the Horticultural
Society Gardens until 1880.
Permanent buildings housed the
Science and India Museum and the
Petent Collection.
The exhibitions of national
portraits, scientific instruments,
inventions and colonial artefacts
enabled the mortgage repayment to
be completed, and the Estate
allocated sites for eductional
institutions in 1880
