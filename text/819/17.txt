'Ryoko makes them pay'
The Seventh
Sign
Although not too many footste;
behind the release of The Las
Temptation of Christ in terms o:
pictures which are literally of biblical
proportions, The Seventh Sign is
much closer to The Omen in spirit
and style.
Once again the book of
Revelations has been pilfered in
order to provide a modern day
drama, and, as with The Omen it
teeters between being a gripping,
frightening drama and just plain
silly.
The film opens within a genuine
sense of forboding, as scenes of
prophesies of the apocalypse
become a reality are intercut with
those of a women (Demi Moore),
going through the last months of
her second pregnancy already
having lost one child. The relevance
of this becomes clear when the
messenger, Juryen Prochnow (easily
the best reason for seeing the film),
visits the woman and it is revealed
that the seventh, and final, sign of
the Apocalypse is the birth of a dead
child, signifying that there are no
more souls left in the Guf Hall in
Heaven (silly eh?). But the fact that
the film manages to keep a straight
face, the production is excellent and

Nico Toscani, an Italian-born
American cop in Chicago is the
unlikely hero of this action thriller.
He is a Vietnam hardened martial
arts expert, which naturally comes
in useful during the many attempts
on his life.
The complicated and quite
implausible plot involves the CIA in
league with drug barons, and up to
no good, in central America. Nico
and his partner Dolores Jackson,
investigate the drugs connection
using that reliable method of beating
up some neanderthal man in a
sleazy bar. po they really have these
bars in America?

Agency' before and recognises its

Steven Seagal co-produced this
film and wrote the story, basing the
main character on himself. He also
rather modestly cast himself in the
title role, and with that in mind, the
film isn't so bad. Seagal is a 6th
degree black belt in Aikado but did
not want to make a martial arts film.
He feels they, 'rarely have any story
and continually fall back on non-
stop, unrealistic action that glorifies
violence'. What made him write

require much intelligence to watch.

A Taxing Woman is a Japanese film
with English subtitles which has
won nine Japanese Academy
Awards for its cast and director,
Juzo Itami. It is his third attempt at
directing, his first film being the
highly acclaimed Ososliki (The
Funeral).

Sharman to do the job. Sharman is
an ex-policeman, ex-drug addict, ex-
thief and frankly and ex-bent

private detective agency, needs the

Quickly he gets tangled up in

other everyday incidents of South

The title of this latest film refers
to Ryoko Itazura a diminutive but
highly effective junior auditor for
the Japanese tax department. The
film revolves around a battle of wits
between her and Hideki Gondo, the
unscrupulous but likeable
proprietor of several 'adult hotels'.
She is unable to link Gondo to the
numerous tax frauds in which he is
involved, despite intense
investigation.
When Ryoko is promoted to tax
inspector she quickly distinguishes
herself in this male dominated, high
risk profession and when Gondo's
ex-mistress phones the department
to expose him she heads the
investigation. The climax of the film
involves the final raid of Gondo's
premises by over one hundred dare-
devil tax inspectors. The result is a
brisk, well directed film with a
strong screenplay which conveys
the intellectual dual between the
leading characters and their mutual
understanding and respect.

fact that it has subtitles should not

is written in the first person, so we
don't know what the hell is going
on either. Except that the real villain
became obvious pretty early on. The
big surprise ten pages from the end
wasn't at all. Luckily a new
character, the Arab dealer taking
over the patch, tells us all about it.
This is Mark Timlin's first book,
and the first of a series featuring
Nick Sharman. The character isn't
entirely believable, being too well
educated and worldly wise, yet
simultaneously too dumb to put the
clues together. Not what you'd
expect from a C.I.D. Officer really,
ex- or not.
Having said that, after an erratic
start it settles down well, and
certainly is compelling, as the cover
states. I think I'll be tempted to buy
Mark Timlin's next book. This is just
the thing for your next long train
journey.
