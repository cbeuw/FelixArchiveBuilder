DIFFERENT BLOOD ALCOHOL
CONTENTS
The approximate blood alcohol concentration of Nigel, Fiona, Chas and Wendy after one drink (one unit of
alcohol) consumed in one hour will be:
NIGEL
10st
(10 mgs)
FIONA
8st 8lb
(21 mgs)
CHAS
12st 81b
(4 mgs)
WENDY
10st
(16 mgs)
LEAVING THE BODY
A small amount of alcohol (less than
one tenth) is eliminated from the
body in urine, breath and sweat.
The rest is oxidised—ie like food it
combines with oxygen in the blood
to release heat and energy or
calories. However, although alcohol
has some nutritional value, it is of
poor quality because it lacks
vitamins, proteins and other
essential nutrients. Also, unlike
food, alcohol is burnt up almost
exclusively in the liver which means
that the liver is one of the first parts
of the body to suffer from excessive
drinking. (Fig. 5)
The liver burns up alcohol
surprisingly slowly. The rate varies
from person to person according to
body weight and to the enzyme
(dehydrogenase) in the liver, but as
a general rule it takes as many hours
as the number of drinks for the body
to completely burn up all the
alcohol. It is a little known fact that
it is possible to fail a breathalyser
test 24 hours after stopping
drinking. (Fig. 6)
ALCOHOL, WEIGHT & DIET
Drinks are high in calories but
empty nutritionally. Excessive
drinking can lead to obesity because
alcohol calories cannot be stored by
the body in the same way as calories
produced by food. This means that
if alcohol is consumed in addition to
a normal diet, alcohol calories are
used by the body while food calories
are stored as fat. If a person
decreases food consumption to
compensate for alcohol, then poor
nutrition is a risk because alcohol
does not contain the vitamins,
proteins and other necessary
nutrients present in real food. (Fig.
7)
Alcohol can also stop the body
absorbing and using vitamins—
especially thiamine, other B
vitamins and vitamin C. The
resulting stress on the brain, liver
and other organs prevents them
working properly. In general,
vitamin deficiency affects a person's
appearance, particularly the skin,
and limits the body's ability to fight
off infection.
