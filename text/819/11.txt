Booze
Alcohol Special
The first Campaign of Welfare
'89, the Union Welfare project,
takes place next week. The aim
of the week is to promote
awareness of students at this
College about the effects of
alcohol, both long and short
term. The culmination of the
week is a low-alcohol and non-
alcoholic drinks promotion in
the Union and Southside bars
on Thursday evening and
Friday lunchtime. I hope you
will come along and try some
drinks that you might even
like!
ENTERING THE BODY
Alcohol is a depressant drug. When
it is swallowed it travels to the
stomach and small intestine (or gut)
and is absorbed through the wall of
the gut into the bloodstream.
The amount of alcohol in the
blood and the rate of absorption
depend on the amount and type of
alcohol drunk, the speed of
drinking, and the amount of food in
the stomach. For a woman it can
depend on her menstrual cycle,
alcohol being absorbed more rapidly
just before a period and during
ovulation. If she is taking the
contraceptive pill, alcohol is
absorbed and metabolised more
slowly.
There is also evidence to suggest
that fizzy drinks carry alcohol more
quickly into the bloodstream. Once
in the blood, alcohol travels to all
areas of the body within a few
minutes quickly affecting the
working of the brain. (Fig. 2)
The immediate effects of drinking
depend solely upon the amount of
alcohol in the bloodstream—the
blood alcohol concentration or BAC.
Blood alcohol concentration varies
according to a person's sex, weight,
body composition, and speed of
drinking. Women tend to have a
higher BAC than men after drinking

THE BODY

the same amount because they have
less body fluid to dilute the alcohol.
(Fig. 3)
The depressant effect of alcohol on
the central nervous system means
that 'messages' take longer to travel
along the nerves in the brain. The
result is a dulling and slowing of the
brain's responses or intoxication-
reaction; thought and coordination
suffer. It becomes difficult to carry
out complex mental and physical
tasks such as operating machinery
and, of course, driving. The effects
vary in severity depending on BAC.
(Fig. 4).
HANGOVERS
Hangovers are partly a kind of
poisoning and partly the effects of
dehydration and low blood sugar.
'Congeners'—the cause of the
poisoning—are impurities present in
all alcoholic drinks but in greater
quantities in darker drinks such as
brandy or red wine. Dehydration
occurs because alcohol is a
diuretic—(ie it stimulates urination).
It also stimulates the production of
insulin, which in-turn reduces sugar
levels. Low blood sugar produces
feelings of drowsiness, weakness,
trembling, faintness and hunger.
The acid in the drinks can cause
stomach upsets.
Although some people find
drinking a great deal of water helps
avoid them, there is no real cure for
hangovers. The 'hair of the dog'
cure is especially dangerous as it can
lead to dependence on alcohol, and
its immediate effect could be to raise
BAC to riskv levels.
