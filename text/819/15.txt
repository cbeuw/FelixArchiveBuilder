The Pill
Unnatural, undamaging or
unresearched?
Feature
of the cervix is really a sexually
transmitted disease. It is caused
either by a virus or a chemical
carried by sperm to the cervix. This
risk much exceeds the pill effect,
even accepting the Oxford report.
The rest of the news is good.
Cancer of the endometrium (the
lining of the womb) was more likely
to occur in women using high-
oestrogen pills, but the complete
opposite applies to combined pills.
Research has shown a halving of the
risk if the pill is taken for one year
and a threefold reduction after five
years.
At least nine studies report a clear-
cut protective effect against cancer
of the ovaries. After five years of
taking the pill there is a two to
threefold reduction in the risk and
some protection continues among
about are not easy to detect.
Perhaps the most that can be said
is that the pill is not quite so
unnatural as appears at first site.

Paradoxically, many pill critics give
little thought to smoking, which is
undoubtedly much more of a
medical risk.
Dr Swann, of the Imperial College
Health Centre, compared the
additional risk taken on by pill-users
with the additional risk involved in
studying in London over, say,
Southampton.
In conclusion, the pill risk,
although not negligible, is very
small, except for women who
smoke, are very overweight, or have
other conditions such as high blood
pressure. In such cases the risks
involved in taking the pill are small
compared with the medical risks
already present.
Twenty controversial years of
research have passed since the
introduction of the pill but quite
what risk faces pill users is still
something of a mystery. There is
one point in the debate, however,
which stands out as being
alarming. Victor Wynn, Professor
Emeritus of Human Metabolism at
London University warned 'As a
scientist, I just think about how
very little research there is and how
few experts there are. I think it's
very worrying'.
Oral contraceptives—'the pill'—are
now claimed to be the most widely
used form of contraception. These
artificial hormones work by
imitating the natural hormones
present during pregnancy by
preventing the ovaries from
releasing ova. They are undoubtedly
Fears about the pill
have been in
abundance ever since
its creation
the most reliable of all
contraceptives provided that the
woman strictly follows the
prescribed schedule, usually one pill
daily for three weeks followed by a
week's rest during which there is a
period of bleeding like a menstrual
period.
Fears about the safety of the pill
have been in abundance ever since
its creation. People are often
concerned that even if it did not
have unwanted side-effects, of
which there are many, the pill's
main contraceptive effect in
suppressing the cyclical activities of
the ovary and of the pituitary gland
is 'unnatural'. However, John
Guilleband, in his book The Pill,
claims that 'having menstrual cycles
and periods is actually not entirely
'natural'. Biologically, suppression
of the menstrual cycle for years at
a time may, in fact, be a much more
natural state of affairs.'
In the past, before there was
effective contraception, the normal
thing was for a woman to be either
pregnant or breast feeding during all
the child-bearing years. A doctor
working in central Africa was once
visited by a women in her early
forties who was worried by
bleeding. By excluding all the other
possibilities, he eventually diag-
nosed this as a normal period. She
had been anxious because she never
remembered having such a thing
before! John Guillard concludes:
'Far from the myth that periods are
normal and necessary to 'flush out
the flues', they really are not what
nature intends.'
As a support for this notion, it
does seem that some cancers, such
as cancer of the ovary, are
commoner in women who have had
more rather than less natural
menstrual cycles during their lives.
Probably for this reason the pill
seems to be protective against
certain types of cancer.
The Oxford/FPA study-1983
The pill risk, although
not negligible, is very
small
suggests increased rates of cervical
cancer with increasing duration of
the pill. After more than eight years
the maximum rate was 2-3 times
that in non-users. However, cancer
ex-users for at least ten years, maybe
even for life.
It would be wrong to ignore the
contradictions to this optimism.
Victor Wynn, for one, still remains
unconvinced. He first criticised the
pill in 1969 when he claimed that the
pill could cause severe damage to a
woman's health. Since then he has
continued his research, emerging
from his lab every so often to cause
an enormous stir, the latest of these
occasions being two weeks ago.
Wynn's latest huge study of 1,800
women shows that even low-level
levonorgestrel contraceptives have
too much of an impact on blood
lipids (the fats that can build up to
cause heart attacks, strokes and
other problems). He claims this is
likely to put pill-users at a greater
risk of heart disease. But even Wynn
admits that the risks he is talking
EPILOGUE
Not a very long time ago having
sexual intercourse before marriage
was widely accepted as being
morally wrong. Sex in itself, in or
out of marriage was rarely
disscussed certainly not in public.
Today contraception is as normal
to the average teenager as going to
school, and phrases such as 'sexual
freedom' are liberally broadcast by
the generation of the 60's and 70's
with some degree of proudness.
Those who retain the old stance of
'no sex before marrige', whether
• their objection is on religious, moral
or other grounds are labelled, at
best, old-fashioned or frigid.
This situation, in itself, somewhat
negates the effect of the slogan
sexual freedom'. We are free to
choose not only whether we want
to have sex but also whether we
don't want to: It is an important
feature of our society that those who
believe that the evidence against
'sexual immorality' is strong should
be able to live according to their
views without fear of social
rejection.
Perhaps the most important
criteria for happiness is self-content.
If each one of us is capable of
accepting first our own, and then
.•our neighbours view-point with
respect, then freedom in its true
'
• sense will be a word we can all be
I proud of.
