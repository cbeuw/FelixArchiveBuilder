HOW ALCOHOL LEAVES TIME TAKEN TO ELIMINATE
THE BODY ^ ALCOHOL
Sweat Glands
ALCOHOL AND STRESS
Because alcohol is a depressant
drug, it can act as a tranquillizer,
reducing stress for moderate
drinkers. However, regular heavy
drinking can increase stress and
nervousness when the drinker stops
for a day or two or when the body
becomes tolerant to alcohol's effects.
The danger in this is that the drinker
mav be tempted to drink more and
more to overcome stress and
tension.
ALCOHOL AND SLEEP
Alcohol's tranquillizing properties
may help a person get off to sleep
and may indeed be a less harmful
tranquillizer than sleeping pills.
Alcohol-induced sleep, however, is
not REM (rapid eye movement)
sleep necessary to provide complete
rest.
ALCOHOL AND
OTHER DRUGS
Alcohol interacts with many other
drugs, often producing a much
stronger effect than expected.
Barbiturates, tranquillizers,
stimulants, antihistamines can all
have quite dangerous effects when
combined with alcohol. One or two
barbiturate tablets taken with three
or four drinks can kill.
People who both drink and smoke
are at extra risk because alcohol
enhances the action of cancer-
producing agents such as cigarette
smoke.
SEX
Many people drink in order to feel
sexy. Although there is some truth
to the claim that people are more
sexually aroused when drinking, the
effect seems to be mostly
psychological. In moderate doses
alcohol can prolong the length of
time before a man reaches orgasm
and at slightly higher doses it can
induce 'impotence' because of its
muscle relaxant effect.
DAMAGE TO HEALTH
In the long term, drinking more
than the relatively safe levels of 14
units a week for women and 21
units a week for men can seriously
damage health. The throat, brain,
liver, heart, pancreas, reproductive
organs and stomach can all be
affected by drinking too much over
a period of time.
Liver disease is widely known to
be caused by alcohol, but research
has also shown links between
alcohol and cancer, heart disease,
brain damage, and infertility. Foetal

condition that occurs in babies of
women who drank heavily in
pregnancy. The symptoms include
physical abnormalities and mental
retardation. Even at fairly moderate
levels, however, drinking during
pregnancy may have harmful effects
on the foetus.

HOW MANY CALORIES IN
YOUR DRINK
are terms used to describe a person
who drinks very large amounts of
alcohol and who suffers very
disturbing and painful withdrawal
symptoms when he or she stops.
The only way he or she can avoid
withdrawal is to drink more,
creating a vicious circle, very
difficult to break.
DRINK CALORIES
1 pint of beer 300
1 glass of wine 80
1 gin and tonic 140
1 whisky 90
1 vodka and orange 130
• Remember: 10,000 extra calories will produce 3
pounds of fat.
• This means that Vk pints of beer a day for 2
weeks could put on 3 pounds of weight.
• Two gins and tonic a day for 5 weeks could fatten
you by 3 pounds.
