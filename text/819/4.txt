Alternative Cabaret
Forget 'The Comedy Story', forget
"The Cabaret Jongleurs', for some
real alternative comedy, get your
bod down to the Houses of
Parliament (a.k.a. 'The Valley that
Time Forgot) and see some real
experts like Norman T don't eat
babies, I just torture them' Tebbit or
Nigel 'Don't worry it's just a blip'
Lawson.
Fortunately, the nice o\'
government has banned the rather
riskee band of comics, Sinn Fein,
you know, the ones who would
often pop up on the news
reminding us of how absolutely
abhorrent the IRA and their antics
are. I thought some of their one-
liners such as: 'The civilian deaths
caused were a complete and utter
accident, nothing to do with us
really, and we're really, really sorry,
honest guv.' A bit tasteless, but
thankfully we can forget about them
and where they come from now.
I prefer the more traditional
performers like Tom King and his
classic routine of piping up about
how suspects in Northern Irish trials
are going to be found guilty if they
stay silent, while three people, who
had all claimed their right to silence,
were being tried for plotting to kill
Tom King. The coup d'etat came
when the judge criticised King on
the timing of his announcement and
the press questioned King on this.
His reply? 'No comment.' The guy
is a comic genius.
Films
This week's recommended list:
Midnight Runs—The excruciating
story of one man's battle against
diahorrea. De Niro spent three
months eating vindaloos in order to
get into the part.
Steak Out—The suspense of two
people who go out for a steak and
get kidnapped by alien lager louts.
Rattle and Hum—The terrifying story
of a man tortured for hours by a sort
of rattly/hummy sound in his
engine. Dustin Hoffman plays the
bit of grit that causes the problems.
Television
Yes, it's baaaaaack!! Pro-celebrity
hunting is back on our screens. The
show that brought us classic
episodes, such as Sean Connery
clubbing Rupert the Bear to death
with a three-wood. What a lovely
swing the Scotsman has. Then there
was when Jack Charlton harpooned
Hipper—a catch to be proud of. And
who could forget the Christmas
Special when Jack Nicholson axed
the entire cast of Bambi into tiny
little bits. This series promises such
delights as Norman Bates, Dumbo
and a twelve-bore shotgun and a
Christmas special involving the cast
of 'Cats', Garfield, Felix,
Healthcliffe, Bill, Wharfdale, a meat
cleaver, chainsaw, Howitzer cannon
short range tactical nuclear weapons
and Nicholas Witchall, Great family
entertainment, so just sit back and
enjoy.
