RE: “An opinion on the Hong Kong issue” –
a Reality Check
An anonymous writer’s outraged response to last week’s Comment article on the ongoing
Hong Kong Protests.

H
ave you ever
read a piece
of writing
so factually
inaccurate that you feel
physically compelled to
reply to it? That was the
exact scenario in which I
found myself after pick-
ing up a copy of Felix
last Friday afternoon.
The article in the
1ST
of November issue
called ‘An opinion on
the Hong Kong issue’
initially thrilled me as
I was glad to finally see
some coverage on this
ongoing issue. However,
as soon as I read past the
title, it was all downhill
from there.
The writer introduced
the Extradition Bill
that the Hong Kong
government tried to
enact on the people (on
China’s behalf) – an act
that resulted in more
than two sevenths of the
entire population on the
streets protesting. Had
the bill passed, it would
have had detrimental
consequences on the
freedom of all Hong
Kongers, giving China
the power to extradite
anyone in Hong Kong
to be judged under the
Chinese legal system
which many organisa-
tions, such as Amnesty
International, have ex-
pressed concerns about
due to their repeated
violation of the defend-
ants’ rights to a fair trial.
In paragraph 3 of
the article, the writer
stated that “the Hong
Kong police have been
markedly restrained
in the face of blatant
violence by the protest-
ers” – a severe disinfor-
mation easily disprov-
able by simple acts of
Googling. Instances of
unnecessary violence
from the Hong Kong
police happened far too
often to be counted, but
an incident that imme-
diately comes to mind
is what happened on
the night of the 31ST
of
August.
Known as the ‘831’
incident, the police
charged into the Prince
Edward underground
station in pursuit of the
protestors trying to go
home. This turned into
one of the most horrific
conflicts between the
police and the citizens,
in which several men and
women, including teen-
agers, were trapped in an
underground carriage,
senselessly beaten and
pepper-sprayed by the
police. No arrests were
even made afterward,
showing that the police
felt no need for the
scrutiny of law, just the
need for violence in an
attempt to silence those
who disagree with the
system.
Not only have the
protesters been caught
in the scurry of exces-
sive police violence, so
have the volunteers and
journalists on the scene.
On the 11TH
of August,
a medic was shot with
a beanbag round in the
eye, shattering the bones
of her face. On the 29TH
of September, an Indo-
nesian journalist was
permanently blinded by
a rubber bullet. These
are just a tiny fraction of
cases in the overwhelm-
ing plethora of unjust
violence committed
every day by the Hong
Kong police force.
The writer then said,
“I could have sympa-
thised with the protes-
tors had they not shown
such disrespect toward
their country: stamping,
burning the Chinese
flag” – in what reality is
respect towards a flag a
greater issue than one’s
future and freedom?
In the same para-
graph: “Most of us view
social and economic sta-
bility as a precursor to
the extra freedom held
as sacred in the West”.
Freedom of speech is
not ‘extra’; freedom
of press is not ‘extra’,
freedom of assembly is
not ‘extra’; they are fun-
damental human rights.
Those who hold a dif-
ferent view should not
be pushing their agenda
onto others, which is
exactly what China tried
to do to Hong Kong with
the Extradition Bill and
will continuously do
so unless something is
done about it.
Also, “foreign inter-
ference” is deducted
with negative connota-
tions from “photographs
of protest leaders with
Western officials”. First
of all, this protest is
known to be leaderless –
one of the reasons why
all Hong Kong Protesters
were chosen by TIME to
be one of 2019’s most
influential people on
the internet. Secondly,
to quote Martin Luther
King: ‘Injustice
anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere’. It
is in human nature to
right what is wrong. It
is also in human nature
to seek help and to help.
And that is the reason
behind both the leader-
less-proactivity from the
Hong Kongers and the
bipartisan support from
the US Congress for this
pro-democracy protest.
Paragraph 8 states:
“Anyone who is familiar
with the Basic Law and
its complexities can see
that Hong Kong is an in-
divisible part of China.”
What the writer failed
to mention is that later
on in the very same set
of laws, it is promised
that the Chief Executive
of the Hong Kong gov-
ernment shall ultimately
be elected by the people
with universal suffrage.
That could not be further
from the political system
in Hong Kong right now.
The people only want as
much - for everyone to
have the basic right to
choose their own leader,
for everyone to have
the basic right to vote.
It seems ironic that the
writer accuses those
with opposing views
of unfamiliarity with
the Basic Law when
they themselves merely
cherry-picked a section
that supported their own
view.
On top of all the
censorship and police
violence, Hong Kong’s
democracy is also
being ever-corrupted
by puppets of the
Chinese Communist
Party. Joshua Wong,
the founder of the
pro-democracy activist
group Scholarism and
the secretary-general
of the political party
Demosistō, was recently
banned from running in
the upcoming district
council election. This
is a clear obstruction of
political freedom and,
again, a step in further
taking away the self-de-
termination of all Hong
Kongers.
When the police resort
to murder, who do you
call? When your govern-
ment turns on you, who
do you rely on? When
your democracy is being
taken away from you,
you must take a stand.
