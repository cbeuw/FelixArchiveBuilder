Frankenstein: Resurrected for the Modern Day
Forget the body horror of the original - this monster is a cold and calculating AI from the future, a relentless killing
machine that will chill you to the core
I
t’s been a long time
since Frankenstein
was first published.
Written in 1818 by
Mary Shelley, the gothic
novel swiftly became
a cultural icon. Widely
regarded as one of the first
science fiction novels ever
written, Frankenstein fol-
lows the tragic tale of Dr
Victor Frankenstein and
his destructive relation-
ship with the monster he
created. Relying heavily
on themes of religion and
the supernatural, it is per-
haps unsurprising that the
story fails to fill us with as
much horror and dread as
when it was first published
over two hundred years
ago. However, this recent,
ruthless update by the
National Youth Theatre
proves that Frankenstein
is as relevant a tale as
ever. It was brilliantly set
and incredibly acted, and
it made use of innovative
storytelling techniques.
This play was all about
forcing Frankenstein
into the present. Forget
the crumbling tower,
maniacal laughter, and
dead, stitched-together
flesh: the Frankenstein
I watched was firmly
modern, even futuristic.
A brilliant researcher,
Victoria Frankenstein
(Ella Dacres), working at
a laboratory, successfully
creates an anthropomor-
phic AI (Sarah Lusack).
Upon the realisation that
her effort to emulate in-
telligence and feeling has
been successful, Victoria
is filled with disgust at her
creation and rejects her.
What follows is the robot’s
murderous revenge on
her creator, as Victoria
repeatedly fails to satisfy
the robot’s demands for a
companion.
In the original, much
of the tale is told through
letters, between Captain
Bob Walton (Natalie
Dunne) and Garth, her
brother. Letter writing
being rather passé these
days, this antiquated
method of communica-
tion was imaginatively
replaced through on-stage
Skype calls between the
two siblings. Fortunately,
they manage to avoid the
usual Skype connectivity
problems. Each member
of the cast was dressed
in identikit futuristic
white tunics that I would
normally assume to
belong to the kind of
doctors from a nightmar-
ish future.
The most futuristic
segment was the unex-
pected addition of Virtual
Reality to the play. VR
headsets were left under
each seat during the
interval and we were all
directed to put them on to
witness Captain Walton’s
expedition to the North
Pole. Some truly fantastic
imagery was beamed
through the headsets,
with breathtaking shots
of the Arctic rescue
accompanied by how the
world looked from the
robot’s point of view. We
saw the digital renderings
of faces that were used
to train the robot’s emo-
tional sensitivity (trippy
and quite disturbing,
especially when they got
stuck on ‘terrified’). Most
interesting of all, previous
scenes were displayed to
us from the robot’s point
of view, the cast being
shown in the VR world as
3D-rendered, Matrix-style
figures which shouted at
and attacked us.
Overall, this produc-
tion of Frankenstein was
truly stellar. The cast,
the set, the sound - each
element came together
to bring the full menace
of a highly intelligent,
vengeful machine, vio-
lently waging war against
humanity and its creator.
Forget Terminator,
Lusack as the monster
was cold, calculating, but
at the same time entirely
rational in her treatment
of Dr Victoria Franken-
stein. It was remarkable
how I empathised with the
creature even as it ruth-
lessly murdered Victoria’s
family and friends. Each
murder was accompanied
by visceral neck-snapping
sound effects, more than
enough to make me wince.
In scenes where Victoria
appeared happy and safe,
the monster loomed large
from the side-lines, a
constant reminder of her
terrible presence.
Dacres as Dr Franken-
stein was as irrational and
prideful as can be. Her
failure to deal honestly
or effectively with the
monster was convincingly
acted as the agony of her
arrogance came home
to roost. I thought that
the gender-blind casting
choice was very interest-
ing. In the original text,
both Frankenstein and
the monster are male,
and appear to represent a
human’s poor imitation of
God’s creation of Adam.
The gender-blind casting
choice further divorces
the production from the
increasingly irrelevant
religious aspect of the
novel. Instead, it forces the
audience to focus on the
more relevant relationship
between mankind and
their tools. What should
our response be when our
tools achieve sentience?
Will we continue to use
them as our slaves or will
we be forced to make
concessions?
The rest of the cast
were equally fantastic.
Guy Clarke deserves a
special mention as the
most Inspectory Inspector
that I have ever seen. He
has clearly been watching
more than enoughTaggart.
The tragedy of Victoria’s
husband-to-be’s death
was brought home per-
fectly by Jamie Foulkes.
Thought-provoking and
chilling in equal measure,
NYT Rep’s brilliantly
updated Frankenstein
provided a wonderful
evening at a particularly
spooky time of year. Given
the remarkable display of
Great Expectations put on
by the same cast the week
before, I am very excited
to see what each of these
talented actors will grow
into over the coming
years.
