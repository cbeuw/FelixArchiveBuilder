“Thankyouforthewarmwelcomeback”-MyChemical
Romance and Rage Against the Machine announce
reunions!
I
t’s been a hefty week
in music news, after
the shock announce-
ment of a reunion
from emo-legends My
Chemical Romance
shortly followed by a
similar post from the
rap-metallers Rage
Against the Machine.
MCR fans were over-
whelmed on Halloween
after MCR socials posted
about ‘Return’, their first
show in six years after
the group disbanded in
2013. This prompted an
outpouring across social
media which mainly con-
sisted of has-been emos
this”. Elsewhere, Rage
Against the Machine also
announced their reunion
quietly on social media
with a string a tour dates
for next year including a
headline slot at Coachella.
In the wake of this, the po-
litically charged rap metal
band have had to disband
their supergroup Prophets
of Rage formed alongside
members of Cypress Hill
and Chuck D. All of this
came after guitarist Tom
Morello specifically said
to not “wait around for
Rage Against the Machine
– form your own band
and get it done”. Huh.
Rage memorably played a
massive celebration show
in Finsbury Park back in
2010 after a hard-fought
campaign to make their
song “Killing in the
Name” the UK Christmas
number one succeeded,
pushing the X-factor
winner of that year from
the top spot. Turning to
ICU’s Rock and Metal
society to find out which
reunion is more exciting,
there seemed to be over-
whelming support for
Rage returning. Perhaps
we’re all looking forward
to their take on Trump?
Feelingstressed? Put these chilltunes to the test!
T
his week I no-
ticed many of
my friends were
finding them-
selves overwhelmed, as
mid-term workload hit its
peak. I also began to feel I
was experiencing a degree
of stress, upon returning
home, after a series of late
nights in the library, I put
on music to relax, finding
certain songs to be a great
comfort. I thought I would
share some of these with
you, reader.
1. Mark Kavuma –
Lullaby to a Fading Star.
This sensuous slow burner
has all the trappings of a
60s outing, surprisingly
however, it came out
earlier this year on The
Banger Factory - a strong
record showcasing some
of London’s rising stars.
Built around a delicate,
classic jazz progression,
delivered by the vibra-
phone’s pillowish tones .
Yawning, rich harmonies
and subtle solos fill out
this instrumental, with a
Hammond organ bubbling
away in the background.
Lullaby to a fading star
will practically lull you to
sleep.
2. Grouper – Vapor
Trails. Grouper is an
indie artist who spe-
cialises in tracks more
atmosphere than song.
A monastic figure, she
hid behind mountains of
equipment and ran off
stage immediately after
the performance’s end
when I caught live her
last autumn. On ‘Vapour
trails’keyboard and guitar,
obscured by miasmas of
reverb build a dense sense
of tranquillity, sweetened
slightly by Grouper’s
vocal harmonies, this
track will take you to the
moon.
3. Bill Evans, Jim
Hall – Romain .When it
comes to relaxing music
Bill Evans is the pianist.
This laid-back outing
features only piano and
pristine guitar courtesy of
Jim hall. The track builds
its backbone around a
menacing head before
delving into delightfully
orchestrated solos from
both Evans and Hall, a
slow, rich, and satisfying
performance from a won-
derful record.
4. Linda Perhacs –
Chimacum rain.. Linda
Perhacs released one
record Parallelograms in
1970, a singer songwriter
collection drawing heavily
from the folk tradition,
before disappearing back
to a quiet life. What makes
her stand out are her de-
lightful vocal harmonies.
Chimacum rain is perhaps
the best example of this,
her half-whispered vocals
delicately blossoming into
a cradling chorus, over
gentle acoustic arpeggios.
5. Christian Scott
aTunde Adjuah – Vid-
eotape. Christian Scott
is a jazz trumpeter with
a unique “Whisper
technique”, creating
breathy atmospheres by
multi tracking his gentle
trumpet tone. From his
2017 record The Eman-
cipation Procrastination,
Scott delivers a crisp,
subtle take on Radiohead’s
track ‘Videotape’. Built
around the same driving
piano progression as the
original, layered instead
with hazy trumpet and
sparse drums, ‘Videotape’
will let you dissolve for a
moment.

stating “nothing matters
now that MCR are back”
while looking distraught
in their finest Halloween
garms. Tickets for this
show sold out in minutes.
The reunion was leaked
by none other than Joe
Jonas earlier this year,
when he claimed the band
had been rehearsing in
a studio next to him but
this was quickly denied
by guitarist Frank Iero
(not surprised, who wants
to be associated with Joe
Jonas?). The band posted
on Instagram to say thanks
for the “happiness we
have experienced over the
past two days” and that
they “truly did not expect
