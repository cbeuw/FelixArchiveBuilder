My Old Dutch Monday Madness:The only way to start
the week right!
FOOD

I
have a very important
question to ask you
all. Do you want a
sweet or a savoury
breakfast? Because at
My Old Dutch, that is the
most important decision
you will be making that
day. This place sports
some of the largest crepe
style pancakes I’ve ever
seen. Their menu is just
as big and is split between
the two choices. They
even want you all to start
the week right with their
Monday Madness deal,
which puts most of their
classic pancakes at £5.95
all day every Monday.
Neither wasn’t an option
because firstly breakfast
is essential to taking care
of yourself in university
and with branches in
Chelsea and High Street
Kensington it’s not a
question of if guys but
which one. Now that I’ve
helped you make that
decision, we still need to
get to the bottom of the
first question. To achieve
this, we need to have the
savoury and the sweet go
head to head in a heav-
yweight championship
fight. Let’s see who comes
out victorious.
In this corner, we have
the savoury section. If you
are one of those people
that finds pancakes and
bacon blasphemous then
avert your eyes because
this place truly pushes
the boundaries of what
belongs on a pancake. I’m
talking things like halal
lamb curry to duck with
hoisin sauce. They’ve got
some that are basically
pizzas with a pancake base
like the Hawaiian with
cheese, ham and pineap-
ple. (I wonder how the
pineapple on pizza haters
would feel about this one.)
The most important part is
that ,crazily enough, they
all seem to work. With
21 classic options, this
section is great for people
who want something new.
Shake up your boring uni
routine and get out of the
rut with these stacks.
If you are feeling even
more adventurous, you
can discard their curated
choices and build your
own from scratch. They
won’t judge your com-
bination choices. Now
this may all sound a bit
too rich for you and that
is fair – it’s not always
best to start the day with
something heavy. Well
they have just the thing
for people like you. Their
lite menu prides itself on
everything on it being less
than 450 calories and it’s
all savoury. Sadly, these
two options aren’t part of
Monday Madness but are
great for when you find
yourself passing by on
other days.
Now in this corner we
have the sweet section.
A runt between the two
in the fight with just 10
do, they do well. The fruits
are tart and sweet and the
servings of ice cream
generous. They just have a
diversity problem but this
section has some friends
to tag team with in this
fight. On the sidelines are
the butterscotch pancakes,
poffertjes and waffles.
Now the butterscotch
pancakes are American
style so they have a
smaller diameter and
more thickness to them.
Only one of them can
come savoury as the basic
egg and bacon combo so
I say these belong on the
sweet side. The buttermilk
options all mirror those of
the classic sweets so the
choice between the two
comes down to a matter of
preference in texture.
The waffles come with
ice cream or cream. Even
though you only get one
on the plate, it makes for a
filling meal with how high
they pile the toppings on
this bad boy. Now we are
on to the poffertjes (which
I still can’t pronounce).
They are the most Dutch
thing on the menu so they
get points for their authen-
ticity. These are quite like
the American pancakes
but a lot smaller and they
give you a lot more of
them. The serving size of
these are strange to me.
For example, the fruit and
ice cake option claims to
serve 2-4 but one person
comfortably finished them
alone. At the end of the
day, all of these additions
to the fight aren’t even
part of Monday Madness.
The waffles get a pass as
they are less than or equal
to the Monday Madness
price anyways.
It seems that this
Monday Madness deal
comes with a lot of terms
and conditions and you’re
right. Many a times I’ve
taken friends to eat here
on a Monday and they
managed to just not be
in the mood for anything
that was a part of the offer.
Also, university is busy.
This deal goes on all day
but there will be weeks
you won’t eb able to make
it. So I want you to be set
for the rest of the week
as well. That is why I can
tell you that is you can get
20% taken off your bill
by telling the Manager on
Duty “Pancake Power”
as you enter. Flashing
your student card will get
you 10% everyday but
Monday so save this for
the weekend when your
buzzword doesn’t work
anymore. Outside of the
Madness, every pancake
you eat can go towards
your stamp card so take
all your friends with you
so you can get your 10th
one free.
As for my question, if
you want to live on the
edge of acceptability, go
for the savoury. Each item
will bring a new experi-
ence and with so many
to pick from, it would be
hard to imagine it getting
boring. If you want some-
thing more comforting
and familiar to give you a
quick burst of energy, go
for sweet. Or come next
Monday to see if the grass
is greener on the other
side.
