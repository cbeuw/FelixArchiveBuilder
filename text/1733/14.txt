Election Section: Understanding the Spanish Election
S
pain will be
holding general
elections yet again
on the 10th of
November, the second
general election in six
months and the fourth in
four years.
In recent decades,
the Spanish political
landscape has been dras-
tically reshaped by the
new, younger politicians
entering the scene and a
surging number of small
political parties, whilst the
larger parties face multiple
corruption scandals. This
provides many explana-
tions as to why we are
facing elections only six
months after the last cycle
in April; one of these
relates to the fact that
the increasing quantity
of parties is not matched
by a growing number of
effective politicians.
After Francisco
Franco’s dictatorship in
1975, a two-party system
very much dominated
Spain’s new democratic
government, with the
People’s Party (right
wing) and the Socialist
Worker’s Party (left wing)
alternating in power over
the years. This relative
stability was overturned
in the last decade when
numerous corruption
cases within the govern-
ment arose, and a general
discontent of Spanish
people with the govern-
ment led two new political
parties to gain traction,
Ciudadanos (centre-right)
and Podemos (left wing),
causing the Congress of
Deputies to transition
from a bipartisan to a
tetra-partisan landscape.
Since then, no party
has been able to win a
majority of the vote, nor
have any been able to
build coalitions to form
a working government,
which led to the disso-
lution of Congress and
the convocation of a new
general election in July
2016. These elections
resulted in Mariano Rajoy
of the People’s Party
becoming the President
of Spain, thanks to the
formation of a coalition
with Ciudadanos and
the abstention of the
Worker’s Party. Yet, in
July of 2018, there was
a vote of no confidence
against the government
and Pedro Sanchez - from
the Worker’s party –
became the new president
of Spain. Last April,

instability and ineffi-
ciency. Since the 2016
elections, negotiations
and horse-trading that
arose from attempts to
build coalitions led to a
broken government that
was focused on solving
internal party problems
than actual nationwide
issues.
One could argue that a
multiparty system could
be an improvement for
Spanish politics. When
smaller parties are forced
to form coalitions, they are
forced to move towards a
middle ground in order
to maintain power, which
is better than any fanat-
icism when governing a
country. As the Spanish

ex-president Adolfo
Suarez said about Spain’s
current situation, “what
at street level is simply
normal, has been elevated
to the political category of
normal”; there is a better
representation, response,
and articulation of the
views of all voters these
days than there was 40
years ago, brought on by
smaller parties that have
been forced to respond to
popular preferences rather
than particular interests.
Yet, it is apparent that
the Spanish multiparty
system has become a
challenge. Indecisive
politicians have focused
more on solving issues
within their party than
on solving national and
social issues, ranging
from unemployment to
corruption, as well as the
current situation in Cat-
alonia. As American po-
litical writer Ben Rhodes
wrote, “things cannot
change unless you change
the people making the de-
cisions” (‘The World as It
Is’, 2018). Spain’s recent
political instability and in-
efficiency did not arise by
chance, but is caused by
the increasing number of
smaller parties competing
for a divided electorate,
and the mediocre politi-
cians leading them.
In the upcoming elec-
tions, a new left-wing
party (Más Pais, led by
“The Spanish

dramatically
reshaped by

politicians

State’s General Budgets,
with a new party entering
the scene: Vox, a right-
wing populist party.
The votes became even
more contested over and
history repeated itself: the
different parties were not
able to agree and establish
a government, requiring
elections to take place
again in a few days.

bipartisan to a multiparty
system has led to political

entering the race, joining
five original candidates
to become the sixth party
competing for the presi-
dency. While polls predict
a similar result for this
upcoming election, hope
still remains that after the
10th of November they
will be able to do their job
and form a government
that is very much needed
to face domestic problems
like high unemployment,
and international ones like
Trump’s tariffs on Spanish
products and the infamous
Brexit.
