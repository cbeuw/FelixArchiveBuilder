BEAT: A breath of fresh air
B
EAT is at the
forefront of
contemporary
dance, chore-
ographed by Igor and
Moreno, performed by
Margarita Elliot. This
production has taken
four years to reach fru-
ition and is the second
piece from this duo. The
choreography encourages
introspection and plunges
into the millennial psyche.
It will enthrall and capti-
vate mature audiences.
Upon entering, the
stage is level with the
first row of seats. Layered
squares of light form a
backdrop, mimicking a
discotheque. As opposed
to other contemporary
pieces that at times seem
quite formal and detached
from the audience, BEAT
provides a breath of fresh
air. From angled lights
that allow the dancer to
see the eyes of the specta-
tors to the minimal staging
where the DJ is nowhere
in sight, everything is set
to maximise engagement.
For contemporary
dance first-timers, the
opening section may be
slightly confusing (we
certainly did not know
what we were getting
into) but it remains
gripping nonetheless.
Soon though, it becomes
clear that the thought-pro-
voking routine tries to
explore many different
facets of our generation.
One of our personal high-
lights was the expression
through movement of
selfie culture, a part where
the dancer stands in the
middle of the stage and
the lights change rapidly,
creating the illusion of
scrolling through a social
media app.
The choreography
itself is varied and inno-
vative, incorporating a
range of different styles,
including salsa and ballet.
The repetitive movements
used throughout the dance
are an expression of the
mundane, lives that we all
live - clearly not utilising
the full capacity - and the
piece makes us painfully
aware of our own physical
redundancies. These
actions are physically
deconstructed throughout
the piece on a background
of deep house beats and
rapidly changing lights;
theircolourandmovement
designed to rope you into
this fantastic recreation
of the disco culture.
They also complement
perfectly the attention to
detail through which Mar-
garita addresses her facial
expressions, a quality
that is lacking in many
contemporary pieces (we
learned this by speaking
to audience members who
were professional chore-
ographers).
Towards the end of the
routine, she swings her
arms in an expression of
freedom while the lights
from all 6 directions
around her cycle through
red, green and blue. The
rapid changes disarm
you, and they completely
fit the mood of the heavy
basslines echoing through
the hall. In an age of
hyperconnectivity, BEAT
offers a chance to switch
off and immerse yourself
in the unforgivingly
honest worldview by an
up-and-coming company
already making waves in
the contemporary dance
world. It’s magnificently
raw.

i r m i n g h a m
Royal Ballet
is on tour at
Sadler’s Wells
with a three-part mixed
bill to suit anyone’s taste.
Three separate pieces by
different minds to dive
into.
The first piece, A Brief
Nostalgia (directed by
Jack Lister) is unsettling.
Two large slates. One
dancer. Her shadow cast
on the wall whilst she in-
tensely holds a Couru po-
sition. The music, an eerie
dramatic sound, is enough
to stun you into a pleas-
ant confusion. The focus
shifts suddenly to anoth-
er dancer with her shad-
ow on a different slate. A
stunning beginning, the
darkness surrounding the
slates formed perfect har-
mony with the music and
movements. However,
what followed provided
no relief and the move-
ments became more cha-
otic, leaving only confu-
sion. The shadows on the
slate became secondary
rather than complemen-
tary to the dancers. Lister
did end the piece with a
beautiful duet neverthe-
less. Adding to the atmos-
phere, the dancers’ loose
clothing heightened the
flow in their movements
and tunnelling gas seeped
off the floor towards the
audience.
Next was The Suit, di-
rected by Cassa Pancho,
founder of Ballet Black.
Ballet Black aims to im-
prove representation for
Black and Asian dancers.
Regardless of demograph-
ics, The Suit was humor-
ous and well thought out.
The plot follows a cou-
ple’s strained relationship
from when the female
partner has an affair. The
simple furniture used on
stage and the acting skills
of the talented dancers
brought to life a play that
could be followed by any
audience member. Pan-
cho successfully used the
choir to accentuate the
principal dancer’s move-
ments, to create separate
storylines simultaneously
and to clearly demonstrate
the tension between the
couple. The choir mem-
bers were even brilliant
props, remodelling into
everyday items as needed.
The titular suit is an artis-
tic symbol - the suit of the
man the female partner
slept with. The excellent
technical use of the suit is
worth the visuals, thus I
would thoroughly recom-
mend you see this piece.
My favourite from the
night.
Nina Sinatra Songs,
directed by Twyla Tharp,
was a conflicting piece for
me. The choice of Frank
Sinatra’s music was ex-
cellent. I couldn’t help but
sing along. The seven cou-
ples all exhibited various
ballet moves in ballroom
form. Unfortunately, it
felt forced. Merging bal-
let dancers with glorious
gowns and heels to rep-
licate a ballroom setting
did justice to neither bal-
let nor ballroom dancing.
Moreover, while the clear
theme of Tharp’s chore-
ography was love, I only
truly felt the tenderness
in one out of the seven
couples. Moving as one
and fully engaged with
each other, their chemis-
try offset the discordance
in dance styles. The part-
nerwork in this piece did
not flow well, despite the
excellent technique of in-
dividual dancers.
You are spoilt for vari-
ety by Birmingham Royal
Ballet’s Mixed Bill - it is
definitely worth going to
appreciate different styles
and movements.
