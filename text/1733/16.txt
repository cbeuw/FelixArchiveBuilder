EUphoria and the EU’s Role in the People’s Vote
POLITICS

rexit has been
the main object
of political
attention for
the past year, dividing
UK’s population in half:
pro-Brexit and pro-EU.
The latter is interclass,
constituted by voters
mainly ranging from
centre to left from all
ages. In 2018, a pro-EU
campaign group aiming to
hold another referendum
was formed, People’s
Vote, and with it subse-
quent marches of masses
in London throughout the
past year.
Among the supporters
of the People’s Vote group
are Liberal Democrats,
some conservative MPs,
and companies like
Superdry that do not
want to renounce to the
EU market. Although
supported by them,
People`s Vote represents
the more humble sector
of the pro-EU movement,
usually referred to as “the
people” in political dis-
course. This has morphed
the pro-EU faction into a
popular mass movement
fighting for immigration,
social progress, and job
security amongst other
issues, professing a feeling
of love and faith in the
EU being the solution to
these issues: “EUphoria”.
But how is this pro-EU
attitude related to the mo-
tivations behind People’s
Vote?
Brexit per se refers
to the action of the UK
leaving the EU, and thus
originally was a political-
ly blank term that allowed
for interpretation of any
political and economic
flavour. Brexit, as seen
today, however, is a po-
litical process associated
with the right wing of the
political spectrum. With
a Conservative govern-
ment, Brexit has become
a materialisation of a
xenophobic and material-
ist mindset of “the EU is
stealing from us”, which is
just one of the two sides of
the separatist movement
coin (we will consider the
other side later). This con-
servative agenda of Brexit
induced. This same bar-
gaining attitude was taken
when UK decided to leave
the EU, enforcing stricter
and stricter requirements
on the conditions of a
deal as time passes. So,
why have these measures
not awakened an anti-EU
movement in the lower
classes that conform the
People’s Vote?
The other side of the
separatist coin is that of
“the people’s”: wanting
economic independence
to secure jobs and support
for lower sectors and
social progress. In other
European countries,
this sentiment is often
represented by leftist
euro-skeptic parties like
Syriza in Greece (before
accepting the EU’s loans)
and Podemos in Spain.
These parties tend to
be populist (meaning
they focus their polit-
ical discourse on “the
people”, or the working
class, and often pit them
against “the elite”, such
as the EU as a political
institution) and are often
born out of mass move-
ments in times of crisis,
whether political, social
or economic. This origin
in the masses gives the
party enough knowledge
about their motivations
to articulate a coherent
framework for them: an
ideology. Once the group
accepts this ideology, the

movement goes from

their ideological ground
and loses its spontaneous
character due to their
organized representation
as a party.
In the case of the UK,
the political conditions
of Brexit resulted in such
a popular movement: the
People`s Vote. With no
political force similar to
the ones discussed above,
members of what now is
the People´s vote only had
Labour as a last resort.
But Labour’s indecisive
support for the left-wing
caseforBrexitandtheirin-
trinsic centre-left position
does not allow them to
fill an organizational role
for this movement. As
Brexit has been presented
as right-wing from the
start, and with no im-
mediate alternative that
is consistent with their
political interests, “the
people” are left alone,

negatively implicates the
lower and middle classes
of society, including im-
migrants, which is what
motivated a reactionary
progressive attitude
against Brexit.
However, the EU is one
of the least democratic
organisms in Europe,
neoliberal and historically
in favour of austerity
measures. The main fears
of Brexit are rooted in
how the EU has monop-
olized certain rights to
itself: travelling, working
abroad, trade... it uses
these rights as bargaining
tools to attract outer states
and keep its members in.
The EU has previously put
these methods in practice,
the prime example being

Thus, this has resulted
in “EUphoria”, a sort of
Stockholm syndrome
where people fighting for
certain rights deposit their
hopes in the very same
institution that threatens
to take them away.
Due to these circum-
stances, the EU has
become the opposite
of what a conservative
Brexit (or just Brexit
itself) stands for: a source
of ethical authority, tol-
erance and democracy. It
has taken on the role of
leftist parties, mobilizing
“the people” through the
People’s Vote movement
and neoliberal forces
alike. This has resulted
in a fervent defence of
the EU as the natural
antagonist to the right,
and further ingrained
the European idea of de-
mocracy in the left wing.
Through People’s Vote,
Brexit has become the key
to the EU to strengthening
its hold over the UK, even
for socioeconomic classes
whose interests they work
against.
