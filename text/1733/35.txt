5 Steps To Improve Your Emotional Intelligence
E
m o t i o n a l
Intelligence is
the one life skill
that many great
leaders possess. Someone
with a high emotional IQ
can navigate the waters
of all life situations.
Emotional intelligence is
the ability to manage your
emotions as well as those
around you. People often
forget how important their
emotional IQ is. Some
of us, undervalue it, we
focus on other things, or
we figure that it’s not that
important. But it is! It’s
very important to develop
and grow your emotional
IQ.
The best way to grow
your emotional IQ is to
do so gradually. Slow de-
liberate changes is a great
method to bring about
lasting changes in your
life. Focusing on areas of
your emotional IQ that can
be improved takes time
and diligence. That’s why
it’s important to practice
emotional awareness all
the time, not just when we
think something is already
wrong.
Here are some ways
you can improve your
emotional IQ.
First Ask Yourself How
You Are Feeling
Being aware of our
own emotions can be
very similar to being
aware of other people’s
emotions. Doing so you
can avoid stressful situ-
ation by evaluating your
feelings before you react.
Checking your own emo-
tional wellness is done the
same way you the check
emotional wellness of
others: by asking.
When other people ask
you how you are doing, it
can be most efficient and
polite to just say “okay”
or “fine” but if you liter-
ally ask yourself you may
reply with something a
little more informative.
You don’t have to carry
on a whole conversation
with yourself, but if you
ask yourself “How are
you doing?” and you
respond with “Well, I’ve
been better,” it might be
something to spend more
time thinking about.
Second, become com-
fortable talking about
your own feelings
So many people find
it hard to talk about their
feelings. But verbalizing
how you’re feeling is
one the best ways to
evaluate your emotional
IQ. Consider stating how
you feel with statements
like “I’m not comfortable
with,” or “that makes me
frustrated.” This method
of expressing your own
feelings will help you
focus and think more
about how you feel and
how you react to things,
but it also will help other
people to understand how
you are feeling.
focused on everything but
the present. Practicing
Many people are
reluctant to get into medi-
tation because it often has
religious connotations.
While the oldest forms of
meditation are explicitly
religious, more modern
forms of meditation focus
exclusively on the secular
benefits of meditation.
Related to but slightly dif-
ferent from mindfulness,
mediation involves taking
a part of the day, as little
as a few minutes, to clear
your mind.
Clearing your mind can
bring its own benefits,
although it is very diffi-
cult. Recognizing what
thoughts or feelings make
it difficult to clear your
mind can help you to
recognize which things in
your life are giving you
the most trouble.
As was the case with
mindfulness, there are
a lot of great resources
online regarding medi-
tation, but the best place
to start may be a friendly
conversation with your
primary care provider.
Finally, you can write as
a method to increase
your emotional intelli-
gence.
Many people who
journal find it helpful
to express themselves
privately. Writing can be
very therapeutic. You can
write daily, or when you
need to express yourself.
Documenting your expe-
riences can be a tool to see
areas of growth in your
life. Writing can help you
to express your feelings
in a safe and healthy way
but re-reading your own
work can also help you to
see your own experiences
from a new perspective.
This can help you to
understand your feelings
and can allow you to
identify creative solutions
to your problems.

It’s important to keep
focused on the topic and
try not to get distracted.
When your “I’s” get
too close together it can
become rude, but it may
also distort your outlook.
Third Practice Mindful-
ness
The practice of mind-
fulness will encourage
you to be aware of your
thoughts and feelings, as
well as how they make
you feel physically. Your
body can become tense,
your muscles tighten,
and you start breathing
rapidly. Mindfulness ex-
ercises that focus on your
breath and breathing are a
great way to relieve stress
and get you back on track.
Another key attribute
of mindfulness is being
aware of your current state
of mind. Staying present
is a great way to control
your emotions. Often
people find themselves
“It’s important
to practice
emotional
awareness
all the time,
not just when
we think
something is
already wrong”
Meditation can help with matters of the mind// Mindful
“Emotional
intelligence is
the ability to
manage your
emotions as
well as those
around you”

life. Starting with understanding where you currently are and what skills you need to develop to master your
emotions can help you find success in all areas of life.
