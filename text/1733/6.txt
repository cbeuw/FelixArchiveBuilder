A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
This week, Felix sat down with the Deputy President (Clubs and Societies), Thomas Fernandez-Debets, to talk
about space, room bookings, Ethos, White City, and more
Felix: Talk to us about
room bookings – there
have been issues!
Tom: It’s not a secret to
say the activities team is
nonexistent – we have
a Student Activities
Manager, and a person
working on minibuses
but she’s moving to a
new team next week. We
should have three coordi-
nators but just don’t; they
left all at the same time.
The new roles are out for
recruitment now, and one
of those shut yesterday for
which we will be doing
interviews soon – but
with notice, those new
roles won’t be starting
until mid-December, and
about who should
have responsibility for
room bookings where.
Currently College have
taken over your backlog
of room bookings –
how’s that moving
forward, would the
College be taking over
bookings even in the
Union building?
Tom: We just handed
over their own rooms to
College – I think we still
manage our own space.
Before the loss of staff,
we had Hannah Hart
doing it for Union and
College buildings. We
have privileges and rights
for usage of space within
the Union building, but
we have to follow agree-
ments with College about
their space – for some
rooms we can use them
whenever we want over
the weekend, for example,
whereas for others we
need to ask permission
from building managers.
But Hannah has left, and
the loss of knowledge hits
hard. The silver lining is
that her being so good at
it hid a lot of fundamental
issues in the background,
and now we can see those
and take a look at what it
requires in terms of time
and resource and CSP
engagement. It’s really
informative for looking
ahead and at how that
team works. In my Union
Council report, I talked
about mapping out our
operations and getting
a better understanding
of how our team works,
because currently I think
none of us really under-
stand it – we’re too reliant
on individuals, rather than
processes that are robust
and reliable over time and
systems to review those
over time.
As always, manifestos are
one thing – but you come
into the role and there’s
always a lot more to focus
on and deal with.

// ICU
Felix: What have you
been working on from
your manifesto?
Tom: Looking at training
has been one, specifically
for CSPofficers, academic
reps, and so on. It’s
becoming a much bigger
project in terms of devel-
oping a training strategy,
and looking at how
knowledge will always
sit with the Activities and
Education & Representa-
tion teams, as well as how
the Student Development
team can help to build the
frameworks and work on
delivery of training and
own that side of things.
It’s not about the content,
but how teams in the
Union can support and
facilitate that.
Felix: Your predecessor,
James, worked all year
really hard on a new room
booking system – the
digital side of it. That was
meant to speed things
up, but hasn’t – partially
because of staffing issues,
true, but it wasn’t enough
to solve the problems.
Tom: I agree with that –
there’s things that need to
be done at the SSG level
to improve the efficiency
of processes. What James
designed is incredible and
will help in the longer
term.This is a new system,
just being rolled out too,
so we perhaps haven’t
used it to its maximum
potential yet. It will be
interesting to see how it
fits in with other projects
being done at the College
– especially as it could,
in future, allow certain
things to be automated
rather than manual.
Felix: Recruiting the
new coordinators, while
also reassessing how the
roles and teams should
work. How do you plan
to address the conflict
between need for people
in the team now, but also
then with training them
we might be into second
term before things come
together.
The Union needs to look
into room bookings; it’s
causing stress on staff
members and CSPs, and
it’s been identified as a
problem for a long time.
At the moment, the Events
and Conference team
from College have been
going through the backlog
of bookings and I believe
are about caught up – we
have an agreement with
them. But it does raise
fundamental questions
about who should be
doing it – do we, with our
current structure, have the
capacity to deliver the
service we want to deliver
to CSPs?
Additionally, as part of
my role I sit on the Space
Steering Group (SSG)
which brings in people
from different depart-
ments like timetabling
and IT and is chaired
by Chris Banks – who
is Assistant Provost
(Space) and Director of
Library Services. Room
booking is a topic on
their agenda, as everyone
wants to book rooms for
exams and lectures and
activities. They’re finally
getting to the bottom of it,
and Chris has been doing
goodworkwithherteams,
putting in place tools that
adequately address staff
or student needs.
The big issue we have at
Imperial is that everything
is very modular between
departments and such,
where each one has
ownership of their own
space and has their own
individual databases for
bookings. Those are now
bringing bought together,
which is a huge project
and has been being
worked on over two years.
Felix: So the SSG have
people working on
unifying the databases,
or are they the ‘vision
people’determining how
it needs to be done?
Tom: The latter – it’s
a project management
group. If any projects are
falling behind then they
get flagged and what they
need gets discussed (e.g.
finances, support.) We
look at how new projects
fit in with ongoing ones,
how they fit in the bigger
picture for different
departments, and im-
proving the use of space
and space-sharing across
the College’s different
campuses. The way it
works right now ridicu-
lous; you have different
systems for everything.
Space-sharing wise, a lot
of departments have their
own rooms and don’t
want to share them, but
obviously it works better
if someone has a space
not being used that’s fit
for another’s purpose.
The projects are trying to
address this problem, this
isolation of individual
departments, and doing
so with facts and data –
there’s a big piece right
now around data collec-
tion in terms of space
usage, on top of merging
systems together.
Felix: You talked
