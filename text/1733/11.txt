One-party autocracy
must be evil, especially
when it is a communist
party
China uses its
economic power to
pursue political aims
China has strong
censorship so it does not
have freedom of speech
Western values/ethics
are universal
Let me clarify the first
misunderstanding by my
own personal thoughts
which might be a little
exaggerated. Unless all
humans except Chinese
nationals died out, China
would not seek any form
of global or regional
hegemony. Please do
not take that seriously,
but more authoritative
comments have been
given by those who have
a say on this again and
the Chinese Communist
Party has its problems,
but I still believe it is the
best party to make China
prosperous, which is the
will of all Chinese. We
don’t want any form of
foreign-imposed values
and systems because that
brings back the memory of
the humiliating history of
the 19th and 20th century.
We don’t export our
communist ideology, and
at the same time, we don’t
want any foreign party
to export their ideas and
values to us by force. We
have our own way, and we
need mutual respect. As a
guest here, I respectfully
point out that your “demo-
cratic multi-party system”
is more problematic than a
“not democratic one-party
autocracy” and will not
do any good to China, so
please just focus on your
own countries and stop
telling China what you
want us to do.
The fourth one is true
to some extent, but what
China did has nothing
to do with threatening
foreign companies in
China. It is agreed around
the globe that a corpo-
ration should obey the
local laws in order to be
able to do the business,
and there is no exception
in China. In China, it is
illegal to spread ideas
containing separatism,
hate, racism and terror-
ism online. I believe it
should have counterparts
in British and American
legal system (otherwise
it means the “oppressive”
Chinese legal system
is actually better). The
Blizzard occurrence
happened because it is
found that some Hong
Kong protesters spread
illegal content mentioned
above in games, so by
law Chinese government
asked Blizzard to censor
the chats in games. If
Blizzard were to allow
those contents, the
Chinese government have
to right to stop its services
in China. So again, I
would like to emphasize
that this is not about the
problem of freedom of
speech, because duties
and responsibilities are
not separable. By this I
think the fifth misunder-
standing is also clarified.
The sixth point is the
most prevailing of all. To
make it simple, I would
say that the statement is
by Henry Kissinger, the
former United States Sec-
retary of State. The book
might be boring, but as a
Chinese national, I found
the content very objective
and especially sharp on
his analysis about how
the Chinese think and
how is it influenced by the
Chinese history. There is
also a YouTuber Nathan
Rich who uploaded
several videos about
China that you wouldn’t
know from Western media
reports. It will probably
be a mind-changing
process, and I am willing
to provide help to any
friends from any cultural
background if possible.
I hope this initiative can
boost the communication
between all ethnic groups
at Imperial.
short, the difference is
so large and Western
people should accept the
fact that your values and
ethics does not prevail
over others’. We Chinese
have our own history and
we are proud of it. We
don’t want to prove our
superiority and we don’t
even think our culture has
it. All cultures are equal,
so please try to learn
about it before you want
to comment on, especially
criticize it.
Lastly, I would take
the advantage of this
event to promote the
communication between
the Chinese community
at Imperial and others. It
is impossible to be aware
of the globe without being
aware of China with a
population of 1.4 billion
and a unique culture from
that of the West. I wish all
those who are interested
in what China really
looks like can start to
learn about China without
prejudice. A book I would
recommend is On China
“We Chinese
have our own
history and we
are proud of
it!”
wrong. We Chinese have
a different culture, which
contains different values.
Personally, one difference
that I think could be used
to explain most of other
differences is that Chinese
believe in collectivism
and solidarity whereas
western culture empha-
sizes individualism. In
“Unless all
humans
except Chinese
nationals
died out
China would
not seek any
form of global
or regional
hegemony”
again, including Kishore
Mahbubani who was the
former president of the
United Nations Security
Council and former am-
bassador to the UN from
Singapore.
The second one and
third one come from a
Western prejudice because
most Western countries
have “democratic mul-
ti-party systems,” and
they have long wanted
to impose this system
on China. As a Chinese
national, I admit that
