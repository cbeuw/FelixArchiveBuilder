Black Milk: The Sugar Coma you’ve been waiting for!
FOOD

B
lack Milk is a
café that is best
known for their
jaw dropping
freakshakes. Now, freak-
shakes have been a trend
that has taken the internet
by storm for some time
now. Originating from
Australia, they can be
defined as milkshakes
topped with something to
give it a twist. This gives
a lot of leeway for people
to go completely nuts.
It range from something
as simple as whipped
cream and sprinkles, to
having burgers balancing
dangerously close to your
drink on a stick. Now,
these aren’t even desserts
anymore. These are whole
meals and they have
become an obsession of
mine as I make my way
through London, looking
for the most imaginative
combinations.
On this quest, Black
Milk had to be one of
my stops. I ordered their
most popular one: The
Salted Caramel Stack
Freak!Shake. When it
was brought over, I didn’t
even know how to start.
In front of me was a
towering glass of biscoff
milkshake topped with
an entire two-layer slice
of salted caramel cake
with whipped cream and
biscoff crumbs to finish it
off. Just saying all of that
was a mouthful. I haven’t
even picked up my fork
yet.
Black Milk goes
against the grain by
presenting their shakes
a bit differently. Most
places have a theirs come
in little mason jars. It’s a
cute aesthetic that gives
the perfect sized rim for
the toppings like donuts
for sure but sometimes I
want to more. Black Milk
use tall glasses that make
theirs shakes really stand
out amongst their peers.
That also mean that their
shakes need a bit more
help standing tall. They
used a wooden stick to
hold the slice in place. It’s
useful but many people
around us ended up asking
for a plate to put their
slice on. The magic of
the freakshake disappears
if you can’t manage to
actually eat it for fear of it
all toppling over.
I decided to power
through and start from
the very top.. The things
I do for Felix. The salted
caramel cake was moist
and decadent. As salted
you can get started on
the actual milkshake. The
drink was smooth and
creamy. It was incredibly
indulgent though I wish
the biscoff taste was more
obvious. Biscoff and
salted caramel are truly a
match made in heaven – I
realise that now. Name a
more iconic duo, I’ll wait.
They also decorate the
cup with extra biscoff and
have chocolate around the
rim if you have it in you
for more.
The café is situated in
the corner of the Fiorucci
store in Covent Garden
but with freakshakes like
this, they definitely make
their presence known.
They’ve got other treats
like their slightly less
intense Black Milkshakes
waffles of cereal cocktail
bowls. Everything is halal
except the lucky charms
because of their marsh-
mallows. Their staff are
great to so you can have
a lovely conversation
while they are creating the
masterpiece. You eat on
the backdrop of the latest
fashion in the store so
make sure you don’t get
too messy! I made sure I
stayed as far away from
them as I could because I
don’t trust myself. I wish
they had a proper place in
London or at least in an
area where some stray ice
cream doesn’t become a
very expensive mistake.
When you visit, have
your camera ready. They
value customers photos to
the point that their entire
Instagram is comprised
of them. They will even
reward you for the perfect
shot. A repost to their
story will get you 50% off
your next milkshake while
a repost to their page gets
you one for free so you
could be back for more in
no time.
The sugar dream
doesn’t have to stop when
you step out the door. If
you want to take the magic
home, you can buy their
Kinderella Cream online.
Yes, they’ve managed to
get the taste of the Kinder
Bueno cream and put it
in a jar. They’ve also got
a sticky toffee, salted
caramel and biscoff sauce
if that’s what you are
really looking for to make
your own sweet creations.
There are some that are
finding all of this to be
way too sickly. This is a
lot of sugar – I can’t deny
that. A sweet tooth was
required to get through
the mountain that was put
in front of me. There is no
doubt that this is exces-
sive. Does it make sense?
No. Are there better meals
you could be having? Yes.
But there is simply such
an appeal of eating things
for the spectacle of it all.
And these cavities-in-a-
cup truly have that wow
factor to them. So, if
you ever find yourself in
Covent Garden, looking
to put yourself through
the biggest sugar high of
your life, this is the best
place to hit up.

caramel is one of my
favourite flavours, I have
some very strong opinions
on the stuff. I always have
a problem with places
serving salted caramel
desserts that just taste
sweet. The salt should be
present enough to make
the caramel taste become
sharper and more present.
I can happily say that this
cake definitely delivered
in that aspect, especially
when it came to the icing
separating the layers. We
were off to a good start.
