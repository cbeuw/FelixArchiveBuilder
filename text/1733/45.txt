Imperial on top of London Once Again!

G
oing into
Mitcham, the
second cross
country fixture
of the season, Imperial
were engaged in a battle to
be the top club in London
with none other than
St. Mary’s University,
Twickenham. Mary’s, the
University of Mo Farah
and a National Lottery
funded British Athletics
Program, was going to
be a tough opponent to
squash. In the first fixture,
the two titanic forces of
Imperial and Mary’s can-
celled each-other out by
going 2 - 1 and 1 - 2 in the
men’s and women’s team
races respectively.
With a strong Imperial
team turning up in the
cold fields of Mitcham
Common, the athletes
were quietly confident of
a dominant performance
over the Mary’s crowd.
Later in the day, after
the dust had settled on a
ferocious battle in South
London, they all eagerly
awaited the team results
as the brilliant individual
performances became
apparent; Georgia Curry
led by example to take
Gold in the women’s
race, a performance
that puts her top of the
overall rankings ahead
of super-fresher Laura
Wright, who claimed the
Bronze. This was on the
back of Laura winning the
U20’s Liddiard XC title at
the weekend. The strong
performances from Chloe
Baker (6th) and Alix
Vermeulen (8th) mean
that Imperial hold places
1, 2, 4 and 6 in the overall
individual women’s com-
petition.
On the men’s side,
Ollie Barbaresi, keen to
overturn a stinging defeat
at the hands of Mary’s’
Tom Butler, beat his foe
this time around to take
the Silver medal behind
Mary’s’ Dan Jarvis. Ollie
now tops the overall
men’s rankings with Dan
Mulryan moving into 3rd
overall after finishing
4th again at Mitcham.
Imperial’s strength
in depth was on show,
with Ollie Newton (8th),
Niki Faulkner (9th), Joe
Pomfret (11th), Tom
Bayley (12th) and Misy
Ormay (13th) packing
strongly to outclass
St. Mary’s rear order.
Imperial now hold 8 of the
top 10 spots in the overall
individual rankings on
the men’s side. The sheer
depth in talent is stagger-
ing: for the men, Imperi-
al’s E team are currently
ahead of LSE’s A team,
and in the women’s, Im-
perial’s D team is ahead
of King’s’A team.
All these brilliant
performances across
the spectrum meant that
Imperial snatched the
victory in the men’s and
women’s competitions
to take a 3 point lead
in the uber-super-dup-
er-big-dog-overall-com-
petition: the Mike Baggs
Trophy, which Imperial
look to retain for a second
year running (eyyy). The
pressure now builds for
Imperial’s men, who will
be looking to match the
women by improving
their second place in the
and overall victories at
the end of the season.
While the feats listed
above are certainly im-
pressive, there is doubt-
less more to come from
Imperial’s big guns. The
season training plan is
geared towards a peak far
later in the year, when we
willgetthechancetoshow
our mettle against the
top teams in the country
at BUCS competitions.
Aside from the dedicated
training and racing,
cross country members
can look forward to
a packed program of
weekly socials, bi-weekly
couch-to-5k, and trips to
Snowdonia, Brighton,
Edinburgh, Chamonix
and yet-to-be-decided
locations of Winter,
Summer and Easter tours.
