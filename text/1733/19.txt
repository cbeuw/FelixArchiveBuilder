Felix Arts: Interview with Anita-Joy Uwajeh
Anita-Joy is playing Roxane, the heroine in Jamie Lloyd’s upcoming production of Cyrano de Bergerac

C
yrano de
Bergerac is a
French verse-
play written
in 1897, telling the
fictionalised story of the
eponymous nobleman.,
whose large nose prevents
him from winning his
love, Roxane. Despite its
somewhat peculiar plot,
the play has proven sur-
prisingly timeless through
the ages. There are at
least five new stagings of
it this year alone - one of
which is Jamie Lloyd’s
upcoming production at
the Playhouse Theatre.
Felix Arts interviews
Anita-Joy Uwajeh, who
has been cast as Roxane,
on the remaking of this
19th century play.
Felix: How would you
roughly describe the
play?
AJU: Traditionally it’s
known as a play about a
man with an incredibly
large nose which is
perhaps some kind of
deformity for him. This
prevents him from getting
the woman he loves
because she is in love with
the beautiful Christian,
who she believes to be a
great writer when in fact
it’s Cyrano.With all of that
in mind, for me the play
is really about love and
insecurity and a longing
for an intimate connection
that looks beyond one’s
exterior image.
Felix: Why is now the
right time to bring
Cyrano de Bergerac
back to the London
stages?
AJU: With regards to
the production we are
trying to create, it is a
very modern outlook to
this classic play. I think
it’s vital now because it’s
a universal story that a
lot of us are dealing with
regardless of what era we
are in.
Felix: You play Rox-
ane, who is the pri-
mary love interest for
various characters
within the play. On a
deeper level, though,
who is Roxane?
AJU: Roxane is a young
woman in a man’s world
who is trying desperately
to reach others with her
mind and language and
makethemunderstandthat
beauty is not everything.
However, she herself falls
victim to being distracted
by Christian’s beauty.
Which makes her a very
real, flawed character and
that’s exciting to play.
Felix: What drew you
to be a part of this
production as this
specific character?
AJU: The opportunity to
work with Jamie Lloyd
and James McAvoy. I
also love Martin Crimp’s
writing and I am excited
about that. In addition,
when I read the play and
prepped for my auditions
each time I found myself
uncovering another layer
to Roxane and the play.
What do you hope
to bring to the char-
acter through your
portrayal of Roxane?
AJU: I hope to bring to
life a fully fleshed out
woman that audiences can
connect to.
Felix: How similar is
your own character
to that of Roxane?
AJU: I would say Roxane
is similar and different in
a way to me. She’s quite
sharp tongued at times
which is similar to me.
But she thinks a lot faster
than myself when it comes
to finding a witty solution
for a particular problem.
Felix: The details of
this production have
largely been kept out
of the spotlight - are
there any surprises
we can look forward
to?
AJU: It wouldn’t be a
surprise if I told you :)
Felix: The is not the
first English adapta-
tion of the play. What
do you think makes it
special?
AJU: Well I believe it has
been translated directly
from the French. I would
also say it’s got a very
particular style.
Felix: Is there any-
thing specific that
you hope the audi-
ence globally take
away from seeing
this production?
AJU: I hope that the
audience globally can feel
inspired to not be held
back by their own ‘big
nose’ aka insecurity and
go for what they desire.
Felix: You have an ex-
tensive background
in both TV and the
silver screen. Howev-
er, your roots seem
to be strongly within
the theatre. What
makes you keep
coming back to the
theatre, and the West
End specifically?
AJU: I love that fact that
every night is different
for both the actor and
audience. And that each
audience member gets
their very own experience
in the theatre even if they
are watching the same
play and I love being a
part of that.
Felix: Theatre has a
reputation for be-
ing inaccessible for
many. The initiative
to release 15,000
tickets for free, and
another 15,000 for
£15 is definitely a
step in the right
direction - what else
do you think can be
done to allow more
people to enjoy the-
atre?
AJU: I think encouraging
it with schools more and
local communities will
really help broaden the
demographic that goes to
theatre.
Felix: What advice
do you have for the
student actors, di-
rectors and the crew
who spend their time
outside of their stud-
ies to put on these
productions?
AJU: Whatever work you
are putting on should be
produced from a place of
love and enjoyment.
Felix: What are some
of your favourite pro-
ductions in London
and where do you
recommend a theatre
novice starts with the
London scene?
AJU: I loved The Inher-
itance when it was on and
a play called The Royale
at The Bush a few years
ago. The Young Vic is
a great place to start or
Globe Theatre or Arcola
or The Bush.
Felix: Have you had
any crazy stage door
experiences?
AJU: Don’t know if this
is a crazy stage door
story but when I was
working at the Globe I
had an audience member
completely fan-out at me
in foyer. It was very sweet
and I was glad she enjoyed
the show but it was a little
intense for me at the time.
