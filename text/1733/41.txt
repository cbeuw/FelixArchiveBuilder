Editor-in-Chief
F
ollowing a slew
of complaints
from anony-
mous intellec-
tuals, the NegaFelix
editor has reaffirmed
the paper’s dedication
to balance and centrism
in a public statement on
Tuesday. The statement
made clear that Neg-
aFelix will “continue to
strive to represent all
student views, no matter
how wet or reactionary,
through new typo-
graphical means”. In
practice, this will mean
that the justification of
all articles in the paper
will change from left to
centre, strengthening its
commitment to balance
in its aesthetic as well
as its content.
The move was lauded
by many, including the
chair of Tory society,
who commented that the
change “represented a
shift about 5pt in the right
direction”, then adding
“this isn’t the end” before
before due to their lack
of passion for unionising.
The initiative has been
supported by new
evidence on the effective-
ness of cosmetic changes
to public perception, with
watchdogs estimating that
circulation of the Felix
may increase up to 69%.
Nice
The motion passed
after a lengthy meeting at
which a few alternatives
were discussed, most
notably the suggestions to
print articles only in the
centrefold, and to con-
struct articles by picking
alternating words from
Telegraph and Guardian
pieces on the same topic.
Also on the table was
an annual “Purge issue”
in which writers would
once a year be invited to
rant about minorities, and
the idea to preface every
article with a quotation
from Mein Kampf. These
options were eventually
dismissed after it was
decided that they weren’t
funny enough.
Not all responses have
been positive, though.
Some radical centrist
groups commented that
the plan didn’t go far
enough since “centre
justification and left
justification are two sides
of the same coin”, adding
their recommendation to
print only “blank pages”
so the reader can imagine
whatever stories they
want. On the other end
of the spectrum, groups
of Arabic and Hebrew
speakers issued a rare
joint statement condemn-
ing the “international
hegemony of anti-right
justification”, prompting
new discussions into
the cultural impacts of
the change. Progressive
groups have also reacted
negatively, with Left
Forum calling the move
“literal fascism”. The rest
of their official statement
was just a list of Face-
book tag groups.
