Battles and Black Midi Live at the Boiler room
Battles and openers Black midi deliver a stunning performance at the Boiler Room’s intimate venue
W
hat happens
when one of
math-rock’s
most for-
ward-thinking bands plays
a tiny venue alongside one
of this year’s most-hyped
groups? The ‘venue’
for this event (basically
Boiler Room’s office + a
bandroom) was down one
of the many backalleys
in Hackney. Were it not
for the small light-up
‘Boiler Room’sign, a lone
security guard and a col-
lection of 20-somethings
waiting around drinking
Red Stripe, it could have
been any kind of garage or
studio space. Tickets were
allocated the day before
through a ballot, and
admission was free with
the caveat that it wasn’t
guaranteed. As a result the
line was round the block
before doors even opened,
many had evidently come
straight from the office.
For those unfamiliar,
Boiler Room is a broad-
casting company that
regularly showcases per-
formances from up-and-
coming DJs. Part of the
fun is having said DJ play
in the middle of the room,
directing the focus on their
music and performance,
as well as the antics of
those immediately behind
them.As you can imagine,
livestreaming parties
online can often lead to
people doing stupid things
in front of the cameras -
often deliberately. In fact
there is an entire channel
on Youtube dedicated to
showcasing the shenan-
igans from the crowd
during BR broadcasts
(People of Boiler Room).
This show was unique in
that the two main artists
were live bands and not
DJs, but the whole event
was still livestreamed
Once Inside, the office
/venue was packed;
everyone immediately
piled into the bandroom,
wanting to be as close
as possible for the per-
formance. Thankfully,
the show was BYOB,
announced earlier in the
day in an email titled
“IMPORTANT IN-
FORMATION ABOUT
BATTLES + BLACK
MIDI TONIGHT”, con-
taining only the message
“It’s BYOB xoxoxo”.
After soundcheck-
ing infront of the full
audience, Black Midi
began their show with
“953”, the opener from
their debut Schlangen-
heim, released earlier this
year. The band switched
between different jittery
time signatures with ease,
a testament to their strong
chemistry and technical
ability - more impressive
for the fact the lead singer
probably gets ID’d buying
a Red Bull. One of the ad-
vantages of playing such
a small space is the tight
acoustics, which really
showcases how well BM
use a range of dynamics
across their songs. At one
point in the opener, explo-
sive drums and feedback
die away to reveal a
twinkly guitar line played
so softly you practically
can hear those outside on
the balcony lighting up a
fag. This only lasts for a
brief moment, before the
drums and other guitars
come crashing back in
with the same intensity.
There’s only a brief
pause before they spin
into their next, in which
the double-digit audience
barely has time to offer
applause. “Of Schlangen-
heim” is much the same as
before, with a constantly
evolving tempo and
rhythm, but with a throb-
bing pulse of sub-bass
that ricochets through the
room. Without pausing,
the band launches into
to the iconic opening
notes of ‘bmbmbm’. The
quickly-muttered vocals
are noticeably different
to the studio version, and
the seemingly-impatient
band members improvise
over the otherwise sparse
drums + bassline here.
During ‘Ducter’, the
finale from their debut
album, the music almost
completely stops during
the breakdown, and the
lead singer stands softly
plucking his guitar, giving
the audience a “Clock-
work Orange”-esque
smirk as he whispers into
the microphone. The bass
then slowly creeps back
in, followed by the drums
and other drums, bringing
their sound to dizzying
new heights.
When they finally reach
the end of their set, it is
only the third time all the
band has stopped together
so it takes the audience
more than a moment
process what they’ve just
heard. BM then casually
saunter through the
stunned crowd and out
of the room, seemingly
unaware of how “Black
Midi just melted my
brain!” - to quote the
instagram story that the
bloke in front just posted.
Spare a thought for poor
Flo Dill, the DJ taking
control of the music after
BM and before Battles.
Not only does she have
an impossibly hard act
to follow, but the entire
audience is concerned
with going for a slash
and a fag before waiting
around for Battles. Which
is a shame because she
ends up spinning some
funky tunes, finishing
on an upbeat italo edit of
‘The Model’ by Kratwerk
- a tune so funky Battles’
drummer John Stainer
drums along to during his
soundcheck.
The crowd spends
their entire set anxiously
waiting to get a good
position in the bandroom
for Battles’ set, which
isn’t as easy as it sounds
as we’re still packed into
the tiny office space. One
mans shout of ‘Come on
England, come on!!’, was
met with chuckles from
the sardines. Inspired by
this stroke of comedic
gold, another sardine
starts shouting ‘Hillsbor-
ough, Hillsborough!!’,
which was not met with
chuckles, but cries of
“Fuck off you nonce”
and “Cunt” - the latter
of which is delivered as
intensely as BM’s drums.
Being packed amongst so
many others also lead to
overhearing a dreadlocked
white guy telling an un-
impressed girl how ‘Yuh,
so basically after doing
DMT my life completely
changed”
Eventually some
audience members are
let in, and Battles begin
with ‘Font Green Park’,
a single from their latest
album (which also has the
nonsensical title of ‘Juice
B Crypts’). Originally a
4-piece, Battles have lost 2
members across 4 albums
and 12 years - quite the
ratio! Their music relies
heavily on loops, so most
of their songs begin with
a simple bassline which is
looped and another layer
is then added over the top.
Through doing this the
two-piece can essentially
have as many sounds as
they like playing over
each other. Still, both
band members have their
work cut-out for them:
John Stainer plays drums
with two hands and all his
heart, whilst Ian Williams
plays a combination of
keys, guitar and synth
pad, often simultaneously.
Although I’m much
closer to the band this
time, I’m behind a
‘wannabe member of the
Boiler Room crew’ who
spends most of the set
recording through their
cracked iPhone 5. Perhaps
she was so focused on
her amateur recordings
to notice the professional
cameraman standing
directly to her right.
Unlike BM, Battles
are very happy to spend
the majority of their set
rattling through their
latest release, it was
satisfying to watch them
gradually construct their
dense sound, layer by
layer, only relying on
samples for the parts of
the guest vocalists. Also,
unlike BM, Battles take
a moment to thank the
audience between songs,
there’s no audio in the mic
so drummer Ian quickly
rattles off a ‘Ba dum tss!”.
Highlights include
lead single ‘Titanium 2
Step’, which begins with
drums coming in hard
and slow, before adding a
fidgety guitar riff, synths
and eventually vocals. At
many points in this song
and throughout their set
it seems almost as if there
are more band members
lurking in another corner
of the office, or that they
might be playing to a
backing track, however
in a few barely noticeable
moments, a loop cuts out
slightly early and their
drums are a fraction off
the beat. This only serves
to humanize their music
and makes the otherwise
clinical precision in which
they play so much more
impressive.
I was lucky enough to
nab a copy of the setlist
and meet the band after-
wards, which made the
whole experience even
better. This is easily one
of the best shows I’ve
ever seen, although my
ears are still ringing from
Black Midi. The videos
are all up on Boiler Rooms
channel, watch it loud for
maximum impact!

“Black Midi
casually
saunter
through the
stunned
crowd,
seemingly
unaware of
brains”
a 25-minute long jam
of mostly unreleased
material. From the way the
band members exchange
glances it almost seems
as if they’re improvising,
although the music is
so tight this is probably
the result of countless
hours of practice. Despite
having a recent album and
a few singles released,
BM spend the majority of
their short set whizzing
through this new material.
It’s unclear where one
song ends and the next
begins, or if this simply
one mammoth song. The
different sections of this
jam are diverse enough
that it remains interesting,
and the band even manage
to carve out some big
hooks, more than making
up for the lack of vocals
in this section. The music
remains anchored by the
unrelenting drumming
throughout.
After a while this
subsides, and gives way
