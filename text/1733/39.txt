W
hy am I
writing this?
Producing
content for
this column often feels
like a chore. I mean, I like
the idea of having a space
for the RCSU in Felix, but
I can’t shake the feeling
that there are fundamental
issues with the constituent
union section as it is.
Every other week or so,
to the left of this column,
we are addressed by the
beloved CGCU President,
Thomas Cross. He typ-
ically goes off on some
tirade about the Imperial
College Union (ICU),
practically frothing at the
mouth whilst doing so.
I’ve made no secret of
my issues with the ICU,
but his articles have the
tact of a crazed homeless
man shouting at you on
the street. And while
his articles are often fun
to read, bringing about
meaningful change within
ICU doesn’t arise from
this sort of discourse.
Instead, it just serves to
alienate readers, giving
them the impression that
reasonably civil.
Not only is there tonal
inconsistency between the
columns of the different
CUs, but it also exists
within our own sections.
Personally, I’ve only
written a few articles for
our section. The other
articles featured here have
been written by members
on my committee on a
range of topics related to
the RCSU. As a result,
there is no unifying
theme, no critical element
that binds these articles
together.While they are all
related to the RCSU, they
don’t appeal to a single
type of student. And that’s
an issue, because I don’t
think this section can be
effective without a dedi-
cated following. Honestly,
the only people I know
who read the CU section
are members of constitu-
ent union committees.
One solution would be
to produce more consist-
ent content. A calendar
with the events that we
are doing, coupled with
notable news from within
the faculty, followed by
any drama happening in
the union. This way, the
content is easily digest-
ible, tonally consistent,
and still allows us to
have a voice. However,
if we were to try this, the
complexity of expression
in the section will be sig-
nificantly reduced.
I’d really like to be
wrong about the effec-
tiveness of this section.
The content here, even
including Tom’s rants,
are some of my favourite
parts of Felix. I just can’t
tell if I believe this only
because we are friends,
volunteering in the same
sector of the union.
To anyone reading
this article, thank you
for taking the time to
listen to my opinion.
I’d like to know what
you think about the CU
section. Please email me
at rcsupres@ic.ac.uk with
any feedback regarding
our content. Maybe
some of your comments
will make writing these
articles every week a bit
more rewarding.
Have a great week.
