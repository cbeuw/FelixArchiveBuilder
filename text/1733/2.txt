The Changing Attitude
t is not a secret that
there is an issue
with satisfaction at
Imperial. The most
oft-quoted metric
of this are the National
Student Survey scores for
student satisfaction – nat-
urally, Imperial students
tend to the quantitative
data first. Scores have
fallen to a startling degree
over the past several years,
starting most notably in
2015.
I do try not to fear
that this is because I
joined the College in the
2014-2015 year, and thus
brought doom and gloom
upon you all. My slightly
narcissistic, reptilian
brain can’t quite shake the
feeling.
Of course, the evidence
is perhaps more obvious
in the qualitative sense.
The jokes we make,
the IC Exposed posts
– they’re relentlessly
negative. Mental health
breakdowns have become
a norm, to the extent that
it’s topical enough for us
to use humour to bear the
tragedy. That’s always a
good marker for an issue
being endemic – when
it’s a reference made
off-handedly; when the
lore of humour around it
starts to become complex
and take on a life of its
own. It’s when you make
meta-memes about it. It’s
intrinsic at that stage. We
have long since surpassed
that point.
Even as someone who
is no longer a student,
and as someone who gets
asked if they’re “all right”
about 12 times a day,
I’m fairly sure I’ve given
the same half-joking
response every time for
the past several weeks:
“oh, surviving.” Nobody
questions it – they laugh,
or give a knowing smile
that speaks not of sympa-
thy, but of empathy. “Me
too,” it says. “I get that
feeling.”
I don’t think there
could be a clearer sign of
the problem – no, not even
a statistical one drawn
on a pretty graph. It’s
been the same since I got
here. We’re quite a tame
university in many ways,
such that our social hazing
of new entrants doesn’t
take the American frater-
nity-esque overtone of
ridiculous and humiliating
tasks, but rather unnerving
them with assurances that
their mental health is soon
to collapse.
That’s not normal. That
shouldn’t be so common
as to become a community
ritual, as our own trial-by-
fire upon entrance to the
university. But it is.
What’s rapidly chang-
ing, it appears, is the Col-
lege’s interpretation and
response. This comes as a
surprise to older students,
who generally feel very
entrenched at this point in
the view that the College
does not care about them.
Perhaps my brief and
extremely scientifically
valid survey of the Felix
office is more biased than
the most p-hacked of
papers in the ‘Journal of
Advanced Journalology’,
but I still feel it valid – I
feel that the feedback is
consistent no matter who
I talk to.
But undeniably it
is happening. New
buzzwords abound. My
favourite is “holistic”;
a close second is “inter-
linked”. It is evident in
the thinking of both the
College and the Union.
It is, in fact, becoming
endemic in itself. Maybe
having such deeply-em-
bedded thinking shaping
every decision in a uni-
lateral way is the more
fundamental underlying
problem, but I’ll take this
over what existed before.
Everyone I interview
seems energised. Tired,
often, but energised. This
is, to a large extent, a
renaissance in College
attitudes and approaches.
The idea that problems are
not isolated to individual
people, departments, or
faculties, but are sourced
in the atmosphere and ex-
perience of simply being
at the College, seems to
be genuinely new.
It’s the result of hitting
a crux point, a catalyst
moment. The renewal of
the directing Strategies
of the College have inter-
sected with a student body
that is finally sick to the
back teeth and becoming
a little more vocal. They
elected Union sabbatical
officers with a fair bit of
fire and backbone, who
have already announced
ambitious plans to rene-
gotiate rent and tackle big
structural decision-mak-
ing issues. For Imperial
students, characteristi-
cally quiet and with the
stiffest upper lips known
the mankind, this is equiv-
alent to screaming aloud.
And so we see what
appears to be a genuine
dedication to change; to
shake things up; to fund
and invest and support
the innovative. I’ve been
genuinely surprised in
my interactions with
people across the College,
especially at the level of
upper management, given
I am part of the corrupted
‘golden oldies’ who
joined a few years ago
and have been taught to
be disheartened.
This week, we spoke
to the two staff members
running Chemical
Kitchen, an off-the-wall
idea that flies in the face
of traditional teaching
perspectives. We ran
a double spread in the
freshers’ issue about
the development of a
high-tech and interactive
‘active learning’ space in
Blackett. We won’t shut
the hell up about the move
to White City and what
that means and entails.
Everywhere I look for
news around the College,
these themes pop up – it’s
about change, growth,
throwing out the old.
I do wonder if this is a
reflection, in some ways,
of the UK voting for
Brexit – which, whether
you agree or disagree with
it, can almost surely be
referred to as a “protest
vote” in response to the
utter stagnancy of British
politics prior. I’d argue
that Donald Trump’s
election in the US was
a similar phenomenon.
It’s a lurching away from
the status quo. Our little
Imperial community, at
every level, is doing the
same thing – rubber-band-
ing away from what
existed before. ‘We are
not happy, and we need to
change things.’
I see this as needed,
but I am concerned that
in the fervour not enough
consideration of future
ramifications is being
given. That may be a topic
for another editorial, but
this is my hot take of the
week.
