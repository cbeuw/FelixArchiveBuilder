Many Medals for IC Triathlon at Relay Duathlon
T
his Sunday
showed an
i m p r e s s i v e
p e r f o r m a n c e
from 24 of Imperial’s
multisport athletes at the
Olympic Velopark, in
the London Universities
Relay Duathlon - the
first race of the year. In
teams of three they would
compete against Kings
and UCL, with each
member completing a
two-mile run, a six-mile
bike and a one-mile run
before passing on to the
next. The gale force winds
and torrential rain of the
previous day had settled,
and the first competitors
lined up on the start line
to prove themselves.
The starting horn
blew and the race was
underway. President
David Ho started out
fast, leading out the
student branch of the
competition and settling
into fourth place overall.
But the lead was not to
last with mixed-gender
team captain Cedric
Ormond speeding past
him on the first bike lap
and holding the lead all
the way to the end of the
leg. Hot on their heels
were Catherine Spurin of
the Women’s first team
and Leo Karlsson of the
men’s seconds, making
his Imperial debut having
transferred from UCL this
year.
Cedric passed on to new
recruit Leo Maisonobe,
who set off at a blistering
pace to record the fastest
student split of the day
and second fastest overall.
By the end of his lap the
Imperial mixed firsts were
ahead of the men, and in
second place in the overall
competition. Alex Wilson
of the men’s firsts was
moving up in the ranks
though, overtaking to
put him only just behind.
Another debutante, Geral-
dine Regnier, showed off
the bike skills she gained
from a summer of touring
to chase after the speedy
UCL team occupying the
lead women’s position.
Moving on to the final
leg there was all to play
for. Matt Ryan wasted no
time closing the gap on
the run, exiting the first
transition neck-and-neck
with first place. He gave
a heroic chase on the
bike, but on the day his
professionally-sponsored
opponent pulled away. He
nonetheless emphatically
secured victory in the
universities category,
finishing more than ten
minutes ahead of the
next competitors in the
category (Imperial men’s
2nds). Armelle Briand,
competing in her first
duathlon, finished off
the mixed first’s efforts
in style. Women’s firsts
captain Alice Duhem
battled through some
lap-counting issues to win
second place in the uni-
versities category behind
UCL, and third place
overall.
The stream of bikes
and runners thinned as
the remaining competitors
crossed the line, including
many Imperial athletes in
their first (but hopefully
not last) multisport races.
With zero injuries, zero
rain and a fair few pieces
of silverware, the winter
season’s first race can be
called a success.

ICHC: Men’s 4s get underway in arduous season
I
n their debut appear-
ance in the Felix,
ICHC Men’s 4s
made the brave and
treacherous journey out to
the ‘Fortress’ Harlington
to play 2 year rivals,
New Bucks University.
After a narrow win in
last season’s league,
tensions ran high before
the match. Captain Ethan
Houchen was overheard
saying ‘This is going to
be a tough one lads… ‘
and with new blood to the
team, chemistry was the
most crucial dynamic the
squad could have asked
for.
The whistle blew…
and the teams were off.
Straight away, IC 4’s felt
under threat – the aggres-
sive style of play by New
Bucks threw the home
team slightly off guard.
After a quick reorgani-
zation of Hunter’s nose,
and a 2 on 1 ‘sweaty’
with the keeper, ICHC 4’s
the ‘DeVIants’ were 1-0
down in 10 minutes.
With a chance to get
panicky and flustered, the
boys kept their cool and
played to their strengths.
With some formidable
‘Tiki-Taka’ around the
midfield from Philpott,
Houchen and Woodburn,
the team managed to
thread some through balls
up for the strikers to take
advantage of. Soon, the
lads got into their stride,
coming into half time with
a 2-1 lead.
Into the second half, the
‘DeVIants’ really started
to settle into their stride.
With a frankly ludicrous
control and half volley
from Berridge and an
almost careless reverse
deflection from McDer-
mott, alongside strong
plays from Singh and
Robertson, the score line
settled to 5-1.
To celebrate the
victory, the boys yearned
for a well deserved ACC
night. With Hall, Xu,
Lloyd and Willis’ excel-
