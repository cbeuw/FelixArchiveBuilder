Kitchen, a new
course rolled
out within the
Department of Chem-
istry, aims to introduce
students to laboratory
skills and practical
experience via a more
approachable and un-
conventional method. In
groups of fifteen at a
time, students spend
three hours a day for
three days in a newly
renovated kitchen space
in the Sir Ernst Chain
Building, working on
lab skills in a relaxed
atmosphere, wearing
aprons instead of lab
coats, and working with
food instead of synthetic
chemicals.
In assigned groups of
three, students follow a
simple protocol to make
cheese or tofu using
coagulating agents and
filtration on the first day,
make a plated dish using
molecular gastronomy in-
gredients such as xanthan
gum and alginate to create
garnishes. Throughout
the process they practice
skills such as measuring
and recording observa-
tions or calculating yields,
use chemical glassware
and apparatus, and learn
molecular gastronomy
techniques like spheri-
fication. But they also
have the chance to funnel
creativity into the dish
they choose to create on
the last day, so that no
two groups end up with
identical plates.
“Whether you want to
be a chemist or a chef,
skills such as meticulous
planning and detailed
observation and record-
ing are vital,” said Alan
Spivey, Assistant Provost
(Learning & Teaching).
This was the key inspira-
tion for the course: taking
advantage of the over-
lapping skills between
working in a kitchen
and a laboratory to teach
students the soft skills
involved in chemistry.
Students coming into
Imperial have varying
levels of lab experience
and confidence in lab
work. Chemical Kitchen
aims to level the playing
field by providing an op-
portunity for all students
to familiarise themselves
with the ‘thinking and
doing’ involved in experi-
ments, under the guise of a
kitchen environment. The
focus isn’t about the exact
technical skills involved,
but rather students’deeper
appreciation of why things
are done the way they are
done. In this unpressured
environment, students
come to understand why
their workspace in labs
should be kept tidy, how to
take lab notes throughout
the experiment and what
to record, why instruc-
tions should be followed
closely, how to manage
their time, and more. With
food, there is an immedi-
ate visible impact of their
actions on the results.
Chemical Kitchen isn’t
just a standalone part of
the course. The skills
taught are relevant to
the chemistry education
the department wants
to deliver, in that the
experience of creating
something in the kitchen
bears resemblance to the
synthetic chemistry labs
students will eventually
do. Accordingly, the three
days spent at Chemical
Kitchen are followed by
two days of the very first
synthetic chemistry labs
for Y1 students. Whilst
students receive feedback
on the lab notes the
produce during Chemical
Kitchen, their first sum-
mative assessment on lab
notes will be from the
synthetic chemistry labs
that follow. This is an ap-
proach embraced during
the chemistry curriculum
review – that students
should receive feedback
on a task before being
assessed on it.
Recrystallisation using
a Buchner funnel is one
such technique that stu-
dents will come across
multiple times in synthet-
ic chemistry labs, but may
have their first encounter
with through Chemical
Kitchen.
The idea for the course
was born out of the rec-
ognition that the skills an
undergraduate chemist
should have overlap with
the skills a chef may have.
One of the people who
recognised this was Jozef
Youssef, Chef Patron
and founder of Kitchen
Theory, a multisensory
design studio which
(among other activities)
investigates how our
senses detect factors like
colour and symmetry to
influence our enjoyment
of food. He helped to
develop the recipes used
in the lab. From Imperial,
Professor Roger Knee-
bone from the Imperial
College Centre for En-
gagement and Simulation
Science, Assistant Provost
Professor Alan Spivey,
Teaching Fellow Dr Luke
Delmas, and Culinary
Education Designer Dr
Jakub Radzikowski
helped to push through the
course’s implementation
under the umbrella of the
curriculum review.
In particular, Luke and
Jakub spent the summer
carefully designing the
activities such that they
successfully deliver the
learning outcomes they
had in mind: for students
to practice meticulous
techniques, plan and
perform simple exper-
iments, and more. As
they explain it, “it’s the
same chemistry skills but
putting a different kind of
face on it – so they don’t
feel like they have to be
experts. A student may
be happy saying ‘I’m
not good at cooking’,
but saying ‘I’m not good
at chemistry’ probably
leaves them feeling more
vulnerable. Chemical
Kitchen is serious but not
serious chemistry, so we
think that students would
feel more comfortable and
confident.”
They said that the
initially zany-seeming
idea was met at first with
positivity from students,
but a more mixed response
from staff.
“Many were kind of
dismissive,” said Jakub,
“but I don’t see why. It’s
on a small scale right now,
and if there is a chance that
it will improve the student
experience and make
them better scientists, I
think it’s worth trying.”
Luke explained that
it’s because introducing
new methods can seem
like an implied criticism
of old styles, though once
exposed to innovation
many staff change their
minds – a sentiment
that Professor Simone
Buitendijk, the Vice
Provost (Education) and
head of the Learning and
Teaching Strategy (LTS),
agreed with.
“Older methods
weren’t bad, it’s just that
times are changing and
we know of more efficient
methods now. Some of
it is, for example, due to
technological advances.
The data we have from
Chemical Kitchen: Leading the Charge on Innovation
First year Chemistry students have been introduced to laboratory work this year via an unexpected medium:
cooking and the kitchen
“They have
a chance
to funnel
creativity into
the dish they
create on the
last day - no
two plates are
the same"
design an experiment to
find the optimal method
and temperature needed
to cook egg yolks in a spe-
cific way on the second
day, and on the last day
“It's the same
chemistry
skills but with
a new face, so
students feel
comfortable
being unsure
or vulnerable”
