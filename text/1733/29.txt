Nearer my God: Foxing’s Transcendental Rock Show
I
saw several bands
live over the summer.
Florence + The
Machine and The
National’s anthemic
chamber pop at BST in
front of thousands in
Hyde park, Black Midi
drawing a respectable
crowd at EartH despite
having released virtually
no music (I also wrote a
review for their show I’m
sure nobody read) and
Muse playing stadium
rock below a towering in-
flatable robot to a packed
Olympic stadium.
But by far the best gig I
went to was also by far the
smallest, Foxing at The
Dome on July 17th.
Both of the friends I
had dragged along had
never even heard of
Foxing. Arriving slightly
later than intended ex-
pecting the opening act to
be already playing I was
surprised to see the venue
almost empty allowing
us to take a spot right
at the front. Unlike any
other band I have ever
seen there was absolutely
nothing between the stage
and the audience, we are
so close that my friend
“accidentally” unplugs
the guitar at one point.
Foxing released their
debut The Albatross in
2014, now considered one
of the best of the 2010s
Midwest emo revival
incorporating orchestral
post-rock elements remi-
niscent of The Antlers into
the classic screaming mel-
odramatic formula of emo
music. Dealer, released
the following year was
more subdued and mature
leaning further into post-
rock influences.
Their latest album
“Fans climb on
the stage and
jump into the
crowd, there
isn’t a security
guard in sight
to stop them”
Alt-R&B masterpiece
Blonde, Sufjan Stevens’
chaotic electro-folk and
progressive pop magnum
opus The Age Of Adz,
Radiohead’s political
Art rock classic Hail To
The Thief and Interpol’s
influential atmospheric
post-punk debut Turn On
The Bright Lights.
‘Grand Paradise’, the
opening track of Nearer
My God also opens the
show with a drum machine
loop and reserved synths
slowly building until
Ricky Sampson and
Eric Hudson’s guitars
finally kick in alongside
John Hellwig’s art rock
drumming as Murphy
screams “I’m shock
collared at the gates of
heaven” igniting the
initially subdued crowd
who break into a full on
mosh during the song’s
outro which sounds like
Radiohead, Godspeed
You! Black Emperor and
My Chemical Romance
covering Taylor Swift’s
‘Style’. “Hopefully we
don’t fuck it up” Murphy
says as Sampson plays
the iconic tapped guitar
riff of ‘The Medic’ and
the crowd joins Murphy
singing “She says, you
always smell like ciga-
rettes”. Sampson does
more tapping during the
explosive guitar solo of
‘Lich Prince’ as Hudson
plays his guitar behind
his back and bassist Brett
Torrence jumps around the
stage. “There’s no more
sun and no more light
shine through” the crows
echoes during the politi-
cally charged ‘Slapstick’
which references Trump’s
climate change denial.
The band plays ‘Rory’
shrouded in darkness bar
a single light illuminating
Murphy singing “Why
don’t you love me back”
as the song builds from
slow piano into powering
drums and Murphy gives
an emotional trumpet
solo. A few fans climb on
the stage and jump into
the crowd, there isn’t a
security guard in sight to
stop them.
Foxing closes the set
with the title track ‘Nearer
My God’. In many ways it
is the thematic centrepiece
of not only the album but
the show. Foxing knows
Nearer My God won’t be
the next OK Computer
and they’ll never headline
festivals or sell out
stadiums like Florence or
Muse but they’re going to
give everything they have
anyways. “I’d sell my
soul, to be America’s pool
boy the crowd centrefold”
Conor shrieks, it feels like
he is on the verge of crying
and laughing at the same
time. During the outro he
jumps into the crowd who
join him singing “do you
want me at all”.
Foxing draw a crowd
of only a few hundred
compared to the tens
of thousands watching
Muse and Florence +
The Machine. Despite
this they manage to make
music considerably more
ambitious, rock much
harder and convey far
more emotion. Compared
to being hundreds of feet
away barely able to make
out the silhouette of Matt
Belamy, I much pre-
ferred watching Foxing
transcend from the front
row. “I feel the love in
suspension and nearer
my God” Conor yells,
arms outstretched to a
crowd similarly extending
upwards inches apart, like
the Michelangelo painting
of God reaching to man.

Nearer My God is one
of the best, most forward
thinking and ambitious
rock albums of the decade.
“This is no OK Computer”
Frontman Conor Murphy
said in an interview with
Uproxx, “But for us that’s
what it feels like”. I think
the comparison is appro-
priate. A genre transcend-
ing modern rock album
rooted in Midwest emo
but combining everything
from glitch pop to art rock
to alternative R&B.
In a reddit AMA
question asking which
albums most influenced
it the band responded:
Frank Ocean’s emotional
