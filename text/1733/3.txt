College Reveals Academic Strategy 2020-2025
T
he Academic
Strategy (AS)
for the next five
years has re-
cently been unveiled by
the College after a long
development cycle. The
Strategy will be used to
inform the direction the
College will take with
regards to investing in
new spaces, curriculum
review, research foci,
and more.
It builds upon the
broader College Strategy,
which identifies the
overall mission of the
College as an institution,
by providing more con-
crete direction in terms of
what it refers to as themes
and capabilities.
As the Provost, Profes-
sor Ian Walmsley FRS,
described it: “the themes
are intended to recognise
areas where the college
has strengths or can see
how to build strengths,
where the college can
see that it can make an
impact, and ways in
which it would go about
delivering that impact.”
The areas affected by
the Strategy are broad,
encompassing staff and
student experience. For
example, the Strategy’s
outlook on societal impact
touches on researchers by
guiding projects towards
particular applied foci,
or students via support
for entrepreneurial ac-
tivity. Most directly, it
influences the decisions
of the Provost’s Board
to provide funding and
support by proposed
projects – whether they
successfully align with
the AS will be carefully
considered as each moves
through a “three-gateway”
process of assessment.
It was developed via
meetings with Faculty
Deans, each of which
presented their own strat-
egies and vision, as well
as Heads of Department,
followed by rounds of
discussion and consulta-
tion both from staff within
departments and with
students.
The AS identifies
four themes: Sustainable
Society (e.g. energy and
manufacturing), Healthy
Society (e.g. disease pre-
vention), Smart Society
(e.g. data science and
machine learning), and
Resilient Society (e.g.
infrastructure.) Each of
these will not exist in
isolation, but instead have
interlinking sub-themes,
in line with a core goal
of transdisciplinary re-
search – which is one of
the four main capabilities
of the College identified
within the AS, alongside
quantitative research,
entrepreneurial spirit, and
engagement on the local,
national, and regional
level.
Ian identified that the
way Imperial remains
world-leading is by stim-
ulating the “intellectual
vibrancy” of the College,
and that transdisciplinary
research will play a large
part in that. A large part of
the College’s dedication
to this is focused on the
White City campus cur-
rently being developed –
which offers opportunity
for new spaces, fit-for-use
in the 21st century, to
be constructed with this
type of research in mind.
The space then vacated
in South Kensington can
be repurposed to further
support this shift in style
and perspective – such as
the transformation of the
Chemistry building into a
the whole College, not for
just one or two people, so
we need to make sure that
is brought together. Part
of it is finding out where
people in the College have
succeeded, and how we
can then utilise and share
that with other parts of the
College – joining up those
ideas.”
Within the strategy’s
structure are several
working groups – one for
each theme, and one for
student experience. All of
them feature staff, but also
student representatives se-
lected in conjunction with
the Union. The goal is to
draw on these “communi-
ty leaders” to reach out to
students, and to draw on
their individual expertise
and knowledge.
multidisciplinary teaching
hub.
One issue identified
with this is that, further
down the line, new fields
may develop which
require departments
relocated to White City
– two miles away – and
departments still in South
Kensington to co-operate.
In this sense, barriers may
be constructed to trans-
disciplinary research. Ian,
however, remains highly
optimistic:
“Firstly - I would hope
that in 30 years, the mix
of disciplines we have
at the university has
changed - it's a vibrant
and living entity, so that's
bound to happen. As for
how to avoid the problem,
take bioengineering as
an example. They have
a footprint in White City
and also one in South
Kensington – so people
will have to talk across
campuses internally, but
also their footprints in
each location allow them
to talk to a variety of
departments across cam-
puses. I can imagine that
having those communities
now connected that way
provides new opportuni-
ty.”
The AS is but one
of multiple strategies
the College employs
to explain and drive
its vision forward. For
example, the Learning and
Teaching Strategy, which
encompasses pedagogy
and curriculum structure.
Each of these Strategies
is, Ian said, intended to fit
together like a “jigsaw”
– each one informing
the others. He gave the
example of projects under
the Estates Strategy,
which would typically
have more concrete
goals, and how they feed
into higher-level people-
and ideology-focused
strategies like the AS or
College Strategy.
“We have lots of
projects we'd like to do,
ranging from delivering a
multidisciplinary teaching
hub in the Chemistry
building here [in South
Kensington], to student
study and social spaces
around College, new re-
search buildings at White
City, and so on. The way
we prioritise those Estates
pieces should also reflect
the priorities of the Aca-
demic Strategy. The inten-
tion is that these strategies
all fit together.”
This type of thinking
– both in terms of em-
phasising research across
departments and interlink-
ing different strategies – is
reflected in the AS’ vision
for the student experience.
It, too, uses the buzzword
of “holistic” experience
that has become a staple
of both College and Union
communications. The new
perspective follows from
low NSS scores in recent
years, which have been
recognised as broader
College issues rather than
localised to departments
or faculties. As Ian ex-
plained it:
“There were many
things one could see were
more fragmented than
they might be, and maybe
drove us to decisions that
didn't take into account all
of the aspects and ramifi-
cations of those decisions.
So ensuring that was min-
imised was a key part for
me of thinking about this
part of the Strategy. Many
problems are an issue for

the direction of their decisions and investment at the strategic level
