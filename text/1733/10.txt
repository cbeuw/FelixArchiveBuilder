y accident I no-
ticed the article
‘ C o m p a n i e s
in China.’ As
a Chinese international
student at Imperial, the
wording in this article is
an insult, not only to me
personally, but also to the
wholeChinesecommunity
and our country. Imperial
College should be a place
where students from all
over the world, including
China, as well as Hong
Kong and Taiwan which
are by all means parts
that cannot be separated
from China. Students can
come to study, progress,
and live peacefully
together. However, Mr.
Titmuss published this
article which is clearly
about politics, a topic
that is not encouraged
at Imperial, without any
perceivable attempt to
seek the truth. Instead,
he has written an article
that is biased, flawed,
arrogant, humiliating, and
irresponsible. This should
not be tolerated under any
circumstances.
First of all, as Mr.
Titmuss seems to be an
advocator of freedom of
speech, I would first like
to ask a question here, not
only to Mr. Titmuss, but
also to all those who are
now believe that mainland
China is a so-called
“oppressive” regime
according to Western in-
terpretations. Here is the
question: Do you know
that THE EXERCISE OF
FREEDOM OF SPEECH
CARRIES SPECIAL
DUTIES AND RESPON-
SIBILITIES? It is clearly
stated in the International
Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR).
Furthermore, it is subject
to certain restrictions “for
of the article to the leader
of our country, and flawed
reference to China as “op-
pressive,” is unacceptable,
as it harms the reputation
of our country. Therefore,
inclusive atmosphere. I
would like to talk about
my own experience. The
first night I arrived at my
hall of residence, we had
a floor dinner. One of my
floor-mates from the UK
asked about the situation
in Hong Kong. My answer
was that mainlanders and
Hong Kong students may
hold different opinions.
A Hong Kong student
agreed and said we should
not talk about it. While
this was not the best sit-
uation as we didn’t fully
exchange our ideas, it
was at least not the worst
where an argument may
have occurred. I personal-
ly respect the attempts of
has happened in Hong
Kong recently is far from
peaceful. From vandalism
by painting and smashing
windows of government
buildings protesters have
moved to attacking police
officers using iron pipes,
molotovs, and even pe-
troleum bombs. I have the
sense that western media
like the BBC, CNN report
events selectively, as
they had always done, to
picture China as “oppres-
sive” which is not true.
They show their audience
police reacting using
arms without telling you
how violent the protests
were. While Western
countries claim that they
have freedom of the press
which “China does not
have,” I always find this
statement ridiculous and
sad. The fact is that people
outside mainland China,
even those in Hong Kong,
have long been deceived
by the distorted facts
intentionally reported by
the media. I suppose Mr.
Titmuss is not aware of
that, therefore I think his
article is irresponsible,
and is not part of properly
practicing the freedom of
speech.
Being in the UK for
nearly a month, I used
YouTube a lot to watch
videos about China from
a western perspective.
I found that people
outside China had a lot
of misunderstandings and
stereotypes about China.
Here I will list some that
are prevailing:
China wants to rule
the world or East Asia
China is ruled by a
communist party so it is
bad
China is a so-called oppressive regime according to Western Interpretations // Wikimedia
“THE EXERCISE OF FREEDOM

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES”
the rights or reputation of
others”and“theprotection
of national security or of
public order.” Mr. Titmuss
successfully practiced his
freedom of speech and I
don’t have a problem with
it, but his insult at the end
I hope an apology can
be made by Mr. Titmuss
in public to all Chinese
students at Imperial and to
our nation.
As a visitor here, I feel
generally pleased because
Imperial has a culturally
“I hope an
apology can
be made by
Mr Titmuss
in public to
all Chinese
students at
Imperial and to
our nation”
a few rational Hong Kong
locals to call for freedom
peacefully. However, what
