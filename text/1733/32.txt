POV: It’s Tricky to Rock a Rhyme That’s Right on Time
T
he SSX fran-
chise is the
Tony Hawk’s
Skateboarding of
the snow (sorry Shawn
White). Fast-paced,
meticulous focus on
gameplay, absolutely
amazing soundtracks and
a few failures recently
with the franchise… But
I am not here to tell you
about all the bad with
SSX, I’m here to spout
about the pure brilliance
that is SSX Tricky.
Over the weekend, I
went home for Bonfire
Night. I couldn’t go home
without whipping out my
GameCube and playing
this gem with my brother
who has played it at least
once a month since it
came out in 2001. The
basis of SSX Tricky is a
snowboarding game. You
choose one of two game
modes: either a race to the
finish or a trick competi-
tion where you try to get
the most points you can
by doing the best tricks as
you make your way down
the slopes. The best part
of SSX Tricky is, well, the
tricks. You can do some
have filled up your Tricky
meter) are absolutely
wild, such as spinning the
board around in your hand
whilst flying through the
air and somehow landing
on two feet.
You can choose from a
variety of characters and
level them up individual-
ly, choosing which stats
you want to improve and
thus determining what
each character specialises
in. They each excel at dif-
ferent things, with Marty,
the best at tricks, being
my favourite. I have com-
pleted every slope on gold
countless times and would
happily do it again whilst
jamming along to RUN
D.M.C’s “It’s Tricky” and
constantly being told to
“bronze those thumbs”.
I don’t know what else I
could ask for in a sports
game. Insanely over the
top tricks, a plethora of
maps, amazing music and
a stupid amount of cus-
tomisation, it really does
stand the test of time.
The one complaint
I have is after a while
pulling off complex tricks
can hurt my thumbs but
I guess that’s just some-
thing I have to live with. If
you are a fan of the Tony
Hawk’s Pro Skater series,
I highly recommend
checking this out. Don’t
bother with the other
SSX games, Tricky is
the holy grail of this now
dead franchise. All I can
hope for now is a remake,
but with EA owning the
rights to it, I don’t see that
happening anytime soon.
Other than that I hope you
all have a great week and
be sure to check out Death
Stranding, out on the day
of this publication. I am
extremely hyped for po-
tentially another Kojima
gem and I hope you are
too!
POV: The Haunted Island A Frog Detective Game
B
rowsing one of
my favourite
gaming news
w e b s i t e s ,
Destructoid, I came across
a recommendation for this
game (currently sold for
$1 on Humble Bundle
and £3.99 on Steam).
The game in question is
“Grace Bruxner presents:
The Haunted Island a
Frog Detective Game”,
and despite its long title,
the game itself is quite
short with a completion
time of an hour. I instantly
knew I was in for a good
time upon discovering
that the game’s graphic
settings had been replaced
with lyrics to ‘Low by Flo
Rida’ – of course, being
a man of culture, I chose
“apple bottom jeans” as
my graphics setting.
The menu screen of the
game also had me chuck-
ling as I saw on the left
an anthropomorphic frog
that was clearly high as
a kite and on the right a
sloth that looked like it
was on PCP. To add fur-
ther to my experience was
surprisingly nice jazz pi-
ano music playing in the
background. Featuring se-
riously thought out names
like Lobster Cop, Mo
“Mouse” Mouse, Fresh X
(the alligator) and a load
of other quirky characters,
this game is not to be tak-
en seriously in the slight-
est. The humour featured
is very much dead-pan
jokes, delivered alongside
a buffet of wholesome-
ness, making the game
that much more adorable.
The adorableness con-
tinues with the whole en-
tire basis of the game’s
mystery being “there’s
a sloth who is hearing a
lot of spooky ghost nois-
es around his island” …
that’s literally it. Treading
on similar lines as Poirot,
the low polygon frog de-
tective must endeavour
to figure out the mystery.
It is my recommendation
that you get the game for
77p from the humble bun-
dle deal, Day of the Dev,
just so you can experi-
ence an hour of chill mu-
sic, wholesomeness and
quirky dead-pan humour.
