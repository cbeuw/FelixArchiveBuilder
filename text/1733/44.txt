A
s one of the
world’s small-
est countries,
S i n g a p o r e
has gained popularity as
Asia’s corporate capital,
but there’s so much more
than business on offer
when visiting this South
East Asian country.
Singapore is also one of
the safest places you could
possibly visit - so whether
you’re embarking on your
first solo travel, or just
want to roam down a dark
street at 4am, you’ll be
absolutely fine here, and
we’ve rounded up our
favourite spots to make
your visit unforgettable…
Food
If you’re anything like
me, the most important
part of any adventure you
embark on is the food,
and Singapore will most
definitely not disappoint.
The multi-culturalism that
comes from the mix of
expats and locals living in
the country makes for one
of the most diverse menus
you’ll ever come across.
Singapore’s Tamil society
has been well-established
for decades now, so if
you’re looking to try some
authentic Tamil cuisine, a
trip to Little India is all
it will take. From stuffed
dosai to biryani curries
served on banana leaves,
the range is endless and
you’re bound to find
something to suit every
palette out there.
If Chinese food is more
down your alley, then fear
not because Singapore has
its own Chinatown and
the food is TO-DIE-FOR.
Marina Bay also has
some great upscale res-
taurants dotted around,
and you get to enjoy the
famous Marina Bay Sands
evening lights display
whilst you fine dine the
night away.
Whilst not necessarily
a food item, I couldn’t
possibly wrap up without
mentioning the bubble tea
in Singapore. Bubble tea stalls are around every
corner, and the local
specialty – brown sugar
milk tea – is a work of art,
and unlike anything you’ll
ever try in London!
Culture
With its prime location,
the island of Singapore
is home to people from
all over Asia, and the
multiplicity of cultures
that comes with migration
gives it some of the richest
heritage in the world.
Singapore’s founder,
Sir Stamford Raffles, allo-
cated different districts to
each ethnic “enclave”, and
with the public transport
being so efficient, each
MRT journey will take
you to a whole new world.
To fully immerse
yourself in Malay culture,
pay a visit to Kampong
Glam, where the Malay
Heritage Centre awaits,
as does a beautiful pasar
malam (night market) that
caters to all visitors.
If you’d like to see how
the local Tamil Indian
community lives, Little
India is where you need
to be. Walking around,
the broad assortment of
scents and colours will
get you submerged in the
culture in no time, and if
you’re lucky enough, try
and visit during holidays
such as Deepavali, when
everything really comes
alive.
Chinatown is also a
must-visit with all the
food,museumsandculture
at walking distance, as is
the Chinese Garden, with
its breath-taking views.
Shopping
Get ready to shop till
you drop here because the
shopping scene in Singa-
pore will tempt you like
no other with shopping
malls at every other MRT
station, all interconnected
through air-conditioned
underground tunnels –
how can this NOT be your
scene?
If you’re after designer
labels and cutting-edge
technology, sports equip-
ment or outlet stores,
Orchard Road is the place
to go. If you’re after crafts,
antiques, and souvenirs,
you might want to pay a
visit to Holland Village,
where you’ll find a market
guaranteed to steal your
heart with its warmth.
More of a small shops and
covered markets type-of-
shopper? Singapore’s got
you covered with Bugis,
a district with over 600
shops dotted around in
tiny lanes, street-side
vendors and high-end
fashion stores.
The best part of
shopping in Singapore?
The 7% tax tourists pay
on goods and services
is easily reimbursed at
the airport prior to your
return home, so let’s get
spending…
