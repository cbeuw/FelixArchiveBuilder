universities such as
Cornell and Stanford is
really promising in that
it shows that both staff
and students have more
fun teaching and learning
with a more interactive
and innovative style.”
One example of tech-
nological changes being
integrated into Chemical
Kitchen is the use of elec-
tronic lab books (specifi-
cally, ELN), replacing the
traditional pen-and-paper
method. This allows stu-
dents to use pictures and
video to note changes, as
well as having a lab book
that follows them between
lab cycles.
Simone also said that
her initial reaction was
excitement, and, most of
all, faith in innovators. “It
was a really well thought-
out proposal, and some
of our top professors like
Alan Spivey and Roger
Kneebone were involved
in that. If they can get
excited about it, I think it’s
worth trying – sometimes
you have to take risks and
see how far you get.”
Chemical Kitchen, it
is worth noting, is not
funded by the department.
Instead, it is funded and
developed through the
aforementioned LTS – a
College-level strategy
that dictates the vision
and direction for invest-
ment and development of
innovative new teaching.
A big part of that, Simone
says, is bringing together
individual pioneers
like those who came up
with Chemical Kitchen
– and giving them “strat-
egy, budget, and support,
rather than having them
feel isolated.”
To that end, and to fa-
cilitate the launch, a space
in the Sir Ernst Chain
Building was stripped
back and refurbished into
a suitable kitchen area
over summer, textbooks
and ebooks were bought
and stocked in the library,
and students from the
StudentShapers program
co-developed the course
in what Luke described as
an “authentic staff-student
partnership”. He contin-
ued: “the success of the
project really relied on
their input; they did a lot
more than just fine-tune.”
There is a possibility
of the lab being tailored
for use in other depart-
ments in the future, and
the course may also be
offered to students from
other departments through
the I-Explore program –
though the current focus
remains on successfully
seeing through the first

cohort of this pilot. There
are “penciled-in” plans
for a showcase in Spring
that demonstrates the
benefits and outcomes
of this course. This sort
of cross-department
and multidisciplinary
approach is a focus of the
LTS – regardless of the
financial structures behind
them.
“Even if they’re
financially tied to a de-
partment, we want it to
be normal to work with
other departments as well.
Projects like I-Explore
are another example,”
Simone elaborated.
“The success
of the project
really relied
upon Student
shapers input”
Chemistry Introduces Roxy the Therapy Dog
T
he Chemistry
d e p a r t m e n t
has introduced
weekly ses-
sions with a therapy dog
this term, in conjunction
with the charity Ther-
apy Dogs Nationwide,
as one of a set of new
wellbeing initiatives.
Originally, the sugges-
tion for a ‘dog day’ was
requested by students and
reps, but the department
felt that regular sessions
would benefit students
much more than a one-off
event. They organised the
weekly sessions – three a
month in South Kensing-
ton and one in White City
– as a response, which
began in August during
the resit examinations
and launched fully during
Welcome Week.
Sessions last around
fifteen minutes with up
to four students, meaning
Roxy usually sees up to
50 students each time she
visits. The appointments
are offered to undergradu-
ate students, but staff and
postgraduates in White
City also regularly drop
in.
The benefits of pet
therapy have been
well-documented in
hospitals, as a method of
relieving stress, encourag-
ing physical activity, and
as a boon to mental health.
Small group sessions
also encourage open and
relaxed social engage-
ments between students.
Student feedback has
noted that many miss pets
at home, and visits with
Roxy alleviate homesick-
ness. Several students
have visited regularly in
a bid to teach Roxy new
tricks.
range being trialled by the
Chemistry department, in
a sincere effort to revital-
ise student satisfaction.
Amelia said that “We are
already getting positive
feedback on this but we
can and will continue to
strive to do more. The
voice of our students and
their wellbeing drives
what we do and we will
continue to do everything
we can to make the student
experience as special as
possible.”
Other new initiatives
include increased well-
being-related posts on
social media via Twitter
and Instagra, ‘ActiviTea’
sessions which get stu-
dents relaxing with simple
tasks while enjoying tea
and a chat, and ‘ChemU-
nity’ lunches which bring
students from all years
to eat with key members
of undergraduate staff.
First years also now go
bowling with personal
tutors in Welcome Week,
and similar sessions are
set up for third and fourth
years later in the term.
The results so far
seem to be making a
large impact on student
sentiment – Francesca
Wittmann, a 3rd year
Chemistry wellbeing rep,
gave glowing praise to the
department.
“Of course there will
always be stressful times
at Imperial and the extent
to which individual stu-
dents feel it varies greatly.
I think the department
is very aware of this and
does a great deal to try
and help us all through
it. From what I have been
hearing from talking to my
peers, they have been very
positive about changes
made over the summer
to the way courses are
run, and they feel that the
department is listening to
them.”
She feels that the
continued low NSS
scores are the result of the
‘delayed effect’ – NSS is
filled out by final-year
students, so the effect of
changes being rolled out
often are not reflected in
NSS for three or more
subsequent years. This
was a thought echoed
by the Union’s Deputy
President (Education),
Ashley Brooks, during
an interview with Felix
earlier in the year.

Feedback thus far
has included a wealth of
positive statements from
students. Examples from
third years include “she’s
the most wonderful dog”,
“favourite member of
the department”, “she’s
a good dog and deserves
more treats”, and “she
needs to come to uni
more!”, as gathered by
wellbeing departmental
representative Angharad
Smith.
Amelia Barron, the
Student Experience
Officer in the department,
said that there has been
interest from wellbeing
officers in other depart-
ments after she shared
Chemistry’s plans and
subsequent experience
via an inter-departmental
network of people in
similar roles – which
may lead to therapy dog
sessions in other depart-
ments.
