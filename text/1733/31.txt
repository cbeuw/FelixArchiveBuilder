Blizzcon 2019: The Ultimate Redemption Arc, or Just
Another Out of Season April Fools’ Joke?
Activision Blizzard has a lot to make up for this year with their recent controversies. There were many big
announcements but very few release dates. Let’s go over everything covered this weekend.

A
fter the failure
of last year’s
Blizzcon with
the likes of
Diablo Immortal, and
the recent controversy
surrounding Activision
Blizzard, all eyes looked
to this year in anticipation
of how they could redeem
themselves. Oh, did they
ever! Let’s take a deep
dive into all the major
announcements from
Blizzcon this weekend
and what they mean for
the future of these beloved
franchises.
Diablo
Diablo 4 is a thing! This
was the ﬁrst thing they
announced and I could not
be more excited! It looks
to be a lot darker and
more gruesome than the
previous games, taking
place far in the future with
a gory aesthetic reminis-
cent of Diablo 2 (satanic
rituals, occult symbols,
LOTS of blood). As far
as we know, Diablo 4 will
require an always-online
connection; this is because
your group of demon
slayers can run into other
parties in real-time. The
gameplay seems quite
similar to what we’ve
seen in previous itera-
tions. As far as the story
goes, we are seeing the
return of Lilith, daughter
of Mephisto; however, the
game is meant to be very
non-linear with 5 regions
you can explore in any
order at your own pace.
No release date yet but we
will keep you posted.
Overwatch
So apparently Over-
watch was due for a
sequel. Overwatch 2 was
announced this weekend.
This full-on sequel will
feature the same gameplay
but with new heroes and
new maps as well as a
focus on co-op and PvE
modes. The strange thing
about this announcement
is that Overwatch 1
players can still play
online with owners of
Overwatch 2, and in
fact, all your skins and
cosmetics will jump over
to 2… so you won’t lose
anything there. This was
all announced with a cin-
ematic trailer called Zero
Hour in which we saw
many returning heroes
ﬁght off a robot invasion
with the aid of a new
“Strangely,
Overwatch 1
players can
still play online
with owners of
Overwatch 2”
“Descent of
Dragons is
looking to
complete the
story of the
League of
explorers and
co. battling
the league of
E.V.I.L”
hero, Echo. Furthermore,
the ﬁrst Canadian hero
was announced, Sojourn.
Sojourn has been in over-
watch before but never as
a playable character so
this is very exciting to see.
There is also a new talent
system available in which
you level up heroes; it is
still unclear how that will
work when cross-play
between Overwatch 1 and
2 is available. Finally,
Jeff Kaplan, the game’s
director, said he has “no
idea” when the game is
coming out, so, again, we
will keep you posted!
World of Warcraft
World of Warcraft
Shadowlands: that just
sounds epic. This new
expansion to World of
Warcraft releases next
year where players are
taken to an alternate realm
of death and decay as they
must choose from several
factions to ﬁght Sylvanus
after she destroys the
Lich King, Bolvar. In the
epic cinematic trailer,
Sylvanus uses Bovar’s
helmet to tear open the
sky and destroy the
barrier between Azeroth
(the main are of World of
Warcraft) and the Shad-
owlands. As always there
is a massive overhaul of
the game’s systems with
the main aspects being: a
new end game dungeon
that looks like its own
rogue-like experience and
a new level cap of…. 60?
As confusing as this is,
with the previous level cap
being 120, it is a beneﬁt as
it will make grinding to
max level much quicker.
The current level of
maxed-out characters
will be reduced to 50 so
you still have 10 levels
to progress through this
expansion… with unique
upgrades to abilities and
talents every level it will
be the type of progression
that players can feel.
Hearthstone
Capping off the end of
the year of the dragon cel-
ebration in Hearthstone,
the 3rd expansion this year
is Descent of Dragons.
Surprise surprise, many
more dragons to add to
your collection! With
several new mechanics
and a new keyword
“Invoke,” it looks like
the meta is going to get
shifted quite substantially.
Invoke is tied to Galak-
rond, the progenitor of
all dragonkind – a very
powerful hero card that
can be upgraded through
3 separate forms. He can
be buffed while in your
deck and any card with
the invoke keyword will
cause him to be buffed.
Every player will receive
Galakrond upon logging
in so don’t worry about
missing out on that fun!
Descent of Dragons is
looking to complete the
story of the League of
Explorers and co. battling
the League of E.V.I.L.
To everyone’s surprise:
there is a new mode being
added! Battlegrounds is
a release date, mark
December 10th on your
calendars.
Smaller News
So now with the big
announcements out of the
way (no Starcraft, I know,
I’m sad too), let’s wrap up
some of the smaller, yet
still exciting, announce-
ments. Diablo Immortal,
the phone version of
Diablo that got everyone
into a rage was playable
and looks very cool. It is
still in development with
no release date (hey, I’m
noticing a pattern here)
but I don’t imagine it will
be much longer given that
it was announced a year
ago. Also announced was
that Warcraft 3: Reforged
is expanding its closed
beta and it will be released
“sometime soon”. So that
was Blizzcon 2019, many
huge announcements but
sadly only one deﬁnitive
release date. Nonetheless,
there is plenty to look
forward to as a Blizzard
fan whether on PC, PS4,
Xbox One or Switch.
Diablo IV is finally here and it looks beautiful... hopefully it will be worth the wait! // Gamepur
an auto-chess-esc game
mode in the auto-battle
genre which will be in
beta pretty soon. Descent
of Dragons does have
