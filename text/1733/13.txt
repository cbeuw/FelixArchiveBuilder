election

T
he trigger has
been pulled on
what every po-
litical pundit is
calling the most important
general election of our
generation. A choice be-
tween chaos with Johnson
or a strong and stable
Corbyn, or maybe it was
the other way round?
For many it is a choice
between Brexit, champi-
oned by Boris Johnson,
and remain, championed
by a woman that would
be prime minister: Jo
Swinson.
Although Brexit will
define and dictate the
outcome of this election,
there are a plethora of
other issues which desper-
ately need to be put to the
people. Whether it be the
NHS, housing, education
or the environment, since
this decisive (or divisive)
question was asked,
everything else has been
put on hold. Already, the
privatization of the NHS
has been the first headline
issue but as with most
elections, it will probably
be forgotten quicker than
you can say “Jacob Re-
ese-Mogg has no common
sense”. What this election
needs is some healthy
debate about a range of
issues.
In recent years, the
Labour-Tory duopoly has
been breaking down due to
the appearance of smaller
parties. Unfortunately, the
current first past the post
voting system, a party can
win a majority of seats in
Parliament without having
even near to a majority of
the popular vote. This was
the case in 2015 when the
Tories won a parliamen-
tary majority with only
37% of the popular vote.
As weird as this sounds,
parties only need to be the
most popular party in each
constituency and thus
when third place parties
become more important,
the margins for victory
become tiny.
One party, which is
trying to push a more
diverse set of issues, has
had some impact despite
being very new. They have
over 65,000 members
across the country, 15,000
more than the Greens.
They have over 50
branches across the UK
but chances are you’ve
never heard of them. They
are the Women’s Equality
Party.
Formed in 2015 by
Catherine Mayer and the
legendary Sandi Toksvig,
the Women’s Equality
Party hoped to push for an
egalitarian society. Equal
pay, representation, and
fair treatment of women
in the media were some
of the party’s initial goals.
Much like Brexit, this new
sort of political ideology
united those from across
the political spectrum who
all agree that women’s
issues have for too long
been put on hold.
Unfortunately, the
party has had very limited
election success in the 350
million elections we have
had since 2015. Their
candidate, Kay Wesley,
was elected as a council-
lor to Congleton Town
Council in 2019, but what
about women outside of
Congleton? Former party
leader, Sophie Walker,
understood that winning
elections was not the
primary goal of the party.
Places where the party
made an appearance,
women’s issues were all of
a sudden put on the table
by the other mainstream
parties. You can’t ignore
women’s issues if you
come face to face with
the unapologetic feminist
stance that this party has
taken. An example of
this was when Labour
mayor Steve Rotheram
embarked upon a long-
term plan to end violence
against women and girls
in Liverpool. This bold
move was done, accord-
ing to him, due to Tabitha
Morton, the Women’s
Equality mayoral candi-
date, who had made it a
priority in her campaign.
There are many other
examples of this across
the country, and although
they are not always as
tangible, a general shift in
the conversation towards
women’s issues is being
seen.
This is all well and
good, but unfortunately, a
strong Women’s Equality
party or any other small
party for that matter
could split the vote and
misrepresent the views
of constituents. As afore-
mentioned, the system
is flawed and as smaller
parties become stronger
and stronger, our voting
system gets weaker and
weaker. Women across
the country who may
be inclined to vote for
this feminist party might
be doing themselves a
disservice if they take
votes away from Labour,
for example, and pave the
way for the Conservatives.
Although the Women’s
Equality Party is the main
focus here, other parties
are available too – and
they all pose the same
issues. The Green Party
for example, has been
faring better and better in
elections with a historic
result in the European
elections. However, they
could also cost Labour
some seats as they split
the vote. Labour’s new
initiatives like the Green
New Deal can be seen
in part as a way of re-
conquering some of the
political territory linked to
environmental issues. The
Green Party will probably
not have more than a bike-
load of MPs journeying to
parliament on December
14th, but they have had an
impact on the politics of
other parties which could
possibly make their way
into government.
Unfortunately, it is not
all sunshine and rainbows
in the current political
scene. The Brexit Party,
which may or may not
have huge electoral
success, has already had
a huge impact especially
on the Conservative
policy. The pressure, and
the chances of a mass
exodus of bumbling
British Brexit voters from
the Tory’s former fanbase
has changed the game for
Boris Johnson. Taking a
hard stance on Brexit is
now his top priority, but
will it be enough to prove
that he is in fact the real
Brexit party?
Another small party
which is worth a special
mention is the Lib Dem’s.
They definitely do not
want to be known as such
and want so desperately
to gain the credibility of
being a main party with a
real chance of winning the
whole thing. A Lib Dem
majority seems as likely
right now as Brexit by the
31st of October (2019).
Unlike the Green party
and the Women’s Equality
party, the centrist politics
of the Lib Dems means
they do not really cause
shifts in other parties’
policies. Sure, Labour has
adopted the policy of a
confirmatory referendum,
but many within the party
had been pushing for this
for a while.
Fringe parties can help
open political discourse,
diversifying the debate
and pushing bigger parties
on key issues. However,
when they get a bit too
big, they start to actually
cause more harm than
good – at least in our
current electoral system.
The Lib Dems today,
have the potential of
letting a ditch-dying Boris
Johnson walk into number
ten stronger than ever.
But at the end of the day,
small parties do have the
power to impact politics
without winning that
many votes. Maybe one
day an LGBTQ+ party
will spring up shifting
the discourse or even a
Students party hoping to
lower tuition fees to pre-
Clegg levels.
