A fairytale on Old Compton Street - Soho Cinders
A
fter an initial
run back in
2012, Soho
Cinders is back
off the west end at the
Charing Cross Theatre,
and its unique narrative
and warm characters
are more relevant than
ever. Set on the iconic
Old Compton Street in
the beating heart of the
West End, this modern
Cinderella sees young
Robbie (Luke Bayer) nav-
igate a rather complicated
love life. Sugar daddies
replace fairy god mothers
and a closeted mayoral
candidate may just be his
Prince Charming!
The opening number
“Old Compton Street”
really encapsulates the
theme of the rest of the
musical. Setting the story
in such a recognizable
place gives an instant con-
nection to the audience
who themselves may have
spent many nights in the
Soho area. For those who
haven’t, the essence of
this street is explained.
Theatre goers, winers
and diners, and a much
younger crowd all flood
the street every day - albeit
at very different times.
The times where these
demographics overlap
gives a real insight into
the diversity that makes
London the best city in the
world.
No Cinderella story,
even this very loose retell-
ing, would be complete
without the ugly step
sisters. Michaela Stern
and Natalie Hern give a
hilarious performance as
these classic characters.
Despite being the bitchiest
and meanest incarnation
of the characters probably
ever seen, they project a
real charm and have the
audience laughing non-
stop. Their song in the
second half, with them-
dressed in unicorn onesies
for their 15 minutes of
fame, does seem a bit
out of place in what is
otherwise a much more
focused and intense part
of the musical. Neverthe-
less, stumbling across the
stage drunk and singing
at the top of their lungs
while still hitting all the
punchlines takes real skill.
Despite the title and
premise of a Cinderella
retelling, this seldom
actually becomes impor-
tant for the plot. What
makes this story so special
is the depth of each char-
acter. Even supporting
characters have their
moment in the spotlight
and win over the audience
in their own way. For
example, Ewan Gillies
gives an exceptional per-
formance as the Malcolm
Tucker-esque spin doctor,
raising the bar for singing
and drama for everyone.
The fiancé, played by Tori
Hargeaves, seemed a bit
one-dimensional and quite
frankly inconsequential in
the first half but is then
presented to the audience
in a much more nuanced
and complete way after the
interval.Aspecial mention
for Millie O’Connell
who plays the best friend
Velcro who brings a real
human touch to the story.
Despite not being given
that much stage time, her
performance is arguably
the most impactful.
Whether you are
looking for a sappy
romance story, a political
thriller, or just a bit of
a laugh, this modern
musical has it all. Come
down to The Charing
Cross Theatre for a
show that will have you
dancing, laughing, and
crying the night away!
The Magic Flute - Mozart’s classic
I
t isn’t easy to picture
a more magical set-
ting than sitting in the
historical auditorium
of the Royal Opera House
as you listen to the over-
ture, eagerly waiting for
the curtain to rise.
Back for its seventh
revival at Covent Garden,
Mozart’s Die Zauber-
flöte (The Magic Flute)
manages to retain the level
of excitement and exhil-
aration throughout the
three-hour performance.
Needless to say, both the
music and singing are
exceptionally melodious,
and the production lives
up to all expectations, an
impressive treat for both
the ears and the eyes.
The director also strikes
a perfect balance between
the solemnity of opera and
the comedy inherent to the
plot presenting Mozart’s
masterpiece in an elegant
and joyful manner.
The Opera follows
Prince Tamino and
Papageno’s adventures
guided by the Three Boys
to rescue the daughter of
the Queen of the Night,
Pamina. The cast is excel-
lent, each with their own
characterful and distinct
voice that combine to
form an enchanting whole.
Every voice has a recog-
nisable originality, be it its
tone, richness, intensity,
or depth. It is simply re-
markable that the human
voice can convey such
complicated emotions
and illuminate each
character’s personality.
Some of the standout per-
formances were given by
Vito Priante as Papageno,
singing ‘Der Vogelfänger
bin ich ja’ very cheerfully
and lightly, suited for the
role, for he is an endearing
and injudicious character.
Benjamin Hulett as
Tamino has a firm and
gentle voice, reflecting
his nobility as Prince. The
delicate harmony between
the Three Boys are most
clear and delectable, and
Queen of the Night’s ef-
fortless ‘Der Hölle Rache
kocht in meinem Herzen’
by Tuuli Takala is also not
to be missed.
The performance is
enhanced by the mag-
nificent set design by
John Macfarlane and the
details included in the
costumes and props. From
the serpent in the opening
scene manipulated by
over 10 actors, the flying
machine that carries the
ThreeBoys,themonstrous
tree, to a grand sun in the
finale, the large-scale set
designs add the finishing
touches to an already
stunning performance.
The playful direction
by David McVicar also
enlivens the stage. The
unexpected entrances of
Papageno from the Stall
Circle seats, clambering
over the separation to
get to the stage, and his
humorous dialogues with
Tamino are especially
vivid and convey the
comical side of Mozart’s
personality itself.
Perhaps, a slight twist
and some innovative inter-
pretations and approaches
would have given the
audience some unantic-
ipated joy. Nonetheless,
the technical and musical
sophistication of the pro-
duction is nothing short of
phenomenal. Directed by
David McVicar and fea-
turing some of the most
iconic pieces of music,
Mozart’s last opera Die
Zauberflöte is on its run
from the 1st
until the 27th
of November at the Royal
Opera House. The classic
magical fable that you
wouldn’t want to miss this
season!
