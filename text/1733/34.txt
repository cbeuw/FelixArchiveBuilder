I
f you’ve ﬂicked past
all of the puzzles
and literally every
other section to get
to Investments, well then
I know you’re probably
a banker w*****. All
jokes asides, if any of you
have read more than 3
articles on FT or spoke to
a Business School student
for 5 minutes, you’ve
probably heard of a deriv-
ative, but what exactly are
they?
A Brief Introduction to Derivatives
formally, it’s a contract
between 2 parties that
states the condition for
which payments are made
to each party. The main
types of derivatives you’ll
encounter are options,
swaps, futures and
forwards. The ﬁgure in the
article shows the common
type of derivatives. I’ll
spare you another 500
words of ﬁnancial jargon
and instead explain each
one as simply as I can.
Having an Option
There are two different
types of options, calls and
puts. Call options give
the owner the right but
not the obligation to buy
the underlying stock at
a given price on/before
a particular date. A put
option is the opposite,
the owner has the right
to sell the underlying
stock at a given price on
a particular date. Let’s say
you think that the price of
Apple’s stock is set to rise
from $250 over the next
month. You go to your
favourite broker and buy a
call option for $50 which
states that you can buy
100 Apple shares at $260
within the next 30 days. If
Apple’s stock goes up to
$270, then you can make
and you’d lose $50 (the
price of the option).
Fancy a Swap?
A swap is exactly
what is sounds like. The
simplest example is an
interest rate swap. Let’s
say I own a $1,000,000
investment that pays me
1% LIBOR each month
(London Interbank
offered rate) and you own
a $1,000,000 investment
that pays you a ﬁxed rate
of 1.2%. The LIBOR
keeps changing in the
market whereas the ﬁxed
rate is well, ﬁxed. I don’t
like the volatility of this
LIBOR rate but you’re
happy with the risk as you
have a chance of receiv-
price of wheat goes up,
you will lose out on the
potential gains. Now
imagine you’re bread
manufacturer and you
think the price of wheat
is set to rise; you could
buy a futures contract to
ﬁx the price of the wheat
to control your costs. If it
does rise, you’ll only pay
what the futures contract
stated. All these trades
happen via a central
exchange.
A forward is quite like
a future with the only
difference being that
forwards are not traded
on an exchange but on an
OTC (over the counter)
market. It is therefore not
regulated which means
it involves some amount
$950 (100*(270-260) -
50). However, let’s say
instead of going up, the
stock price went down.
In this case you wouldn’t

of risk. It’s possible that

in the contract is not able

ing higher payments. So
essentially, we just swap.
Forwards and Futures
A future is an agree-
ment between parties to
buy or sell an asset at a
certain time in the future
for a speciﬁc price. For
example, if you plan to
grow 1000 bushels of
what next year, you could
grow the wheat and then
sell it for whatever the
trading price is. You could
also lock in a price now by
selling a futures contract
that states that you must
sell 1000 bushels for a
ﬁxed price. Doing this
means you eliminate the
risk of a drop in wheat
prices. However, if the
