any clubs
and societies
have their
own tradi-
tions that they cherish: for
some, a varsity match that
they usually win, others
have a sunny picnic by the
beach, some have a WILD
social; for Cross-Country
and Athletics, the first
weekend of November
holds a special place in
the heart of most regulars:
a weekend trip to the St
Mary’s Hut in Caernarfon
in Snowdonia National
Park.
With the trip occurring
for the third year since
its inauguration, the
squad left London Friday
afternoon, packed for
whatever weather the
Welsh mountains had in
store for them, along with
snacks and drinks for the
journey.
After the inevitable stop
in Asda near Birmingham,
the team continued their
fairly bumpy ride up
North, before reaching the
National Park. While the
scenery is outstanding, all
most members remember
of that night’s drive were
the country lanes and
motion sickness of some
few unlucky members.
Having reached the hut
after the first car convoy,
the minibus squad got
home late in the evening
and enjoyed a drink with
those who had arrived
earlier and started the
fire already, happy to find
the hut nice and warm.
Most went to bed quickly,
excited about the adven-
tures to come.
The next morning, all
rose after a good night’s
sleep, fuelled on porridge,
peanut butter, bananas and
chorizo for the most calo-
rie-hungry ones, and got
ready to tackle on Mount
Snowdon as the wearher
looked promising and the
sun coming out every now
and then.
However, the first stop
of the day was neither
a perilous ridge or a
path in the woods, but
the Cwellyn Arms: this
traditional Welsh Pub
in the village of Rydd
Dhu serving 9 real ales
9 days a week, in order
to watch the final of the
RWC. After 80 minutes
of cheering fuelled with
tea or beer for those who
like their morning pints,
the group set off to forget
their sorrows and burn all
“The first stop
of the day
was neither a
perilous ridge
or a path in the
woods, but the
Cwellyn Arms”
“All set off
with a smile
on their face,
ready to climb
up Mynydd
Mawr, some
for the second
time”
those breakfast calories.
The first run of the trip
was the technical climb
of mount Snowdon from
Rydd Dhu. About 900m
of elevation over roughly
7km seperated these
mountain goats from the
summit, so all of them
set off to a good pace,
but the steep gradient led
all of them to slow down
their efforts and approach
some of the segments as a
hike. Upon reaching the
summit, the team opted
for a classic team photo,
paused for everyone to
have some water and
some snacks, before
setting off for the much
more rapid and rather fun
run downhill.
Rather than going down
the same way they went
up, they opted for the
Mountain Ranger path,
taking them by a couple of
lakes, as the rain began to
get heavier. However, no
raincloud could dampen
their spirits as they all
took in the splendid views
and made the most of a
great afternoon.
Having made it down
the mountain, the group
then ran back the few
miles from the bottom
of the Ranger Path that
seperated from Rydd Dhu
where they had left the
minibus and car. Upon
their arrival, rather than
heading straight home, the
team decided to stay for a
bit and spend an hour in
the pub, with some well-
earned chips and drinks
by the fire.
They then returned
to the hut, with a brave
bunch deciding to take
on Mynydd Mawr before
dinner. The near - 600m
extra elevation meant that
when they returned, wet
and tired with everyone
well-rested and showered,
the decision for an early
and high-calorie dinner
was swiftly taken. An
early dinner, a wide range
of games and plenty of
chatting later, the team
headed to bed looking
forward to another great
day of trail running.
In the morning, some
were feeling more fresh
than others after the
evening’s antics, but
all set off with a smile
on their face, ready to
climb up Mynydd Mawr,
some for the second time
already. With their legs
tired from the previous
day’s demanding efforts,
the shorter distance run
still felt very much like a
strong session. Reaching
the summit, the group
huddled up for a while
before taking another
summit picture and
dashing off down the
steep hills between them
and the hut. With no need
to take the minibus to go
back to the hut, those most
keen to shower went par-
ticularly quick down the
hills, thoroughly enjoying
all of their potential grav-
itational energy turning
into kinetic energy, even
when some stumbled and
went for fairly conven-
tional mudslides.
With everyone back,
the squad showered, had
lunch, and started packing
in order to leave early to
head back to London early
as most were keen to have
a nice dinner early and get
a good night’s sleep.
All in all, a pretty great
weekend which shall
happen again, with some
more likely to happen this
year. If you’re keen on
