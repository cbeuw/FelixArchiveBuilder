The Souvenir: A Film about Film
A
ﬁlm about ﬁlm
– Joanna Hogg
takes us on a
sentimental trip
back to the 80s, telling
a partly autobiograph-
ical story of Julie, an
inexperienced ﬁlmmaker
searching for a theme for
her ﬁrst picture and falling
in love with a mysterious
man.
What sounds like a
coming of age story that
many could relate to,
quickly turns out to be
unclear and self-referen-
tial. Perhaps this explains
why the ﬁlmwas so widely
acclaimed at independent
ﬁlm festivals, winning
the Grand Jury Prize at
Sundance, but what may
be relatable and touching
to people from the ﬁlm
industry, seems rather dull
to an ordinary ﬁlmgoer.
The feature is essentially
one two-hour-long chat:
there are conversations
at the table, discussions
in the car, there is pillow
talk and deep-meaning-
ful-conversations at a
party. However, to fully
engage in these we would
have to know the backsto-
ry of the main characters.
Without it The Souvenir
feels like an arbitrary
collection of scenes and
quotes from other ﬁlms.
To be clear, the ﬁlm
does touch on complex
issues – growing up and
gaining independence
from one’s family, drug
addiction, being honest
with oneself – but does
so in a superﬁcial manner,
then wanders off to
another topic without
justifying characters’
actions. The fact that The
Souvenir was shot without
a script, only based on a
short summary of Hogg’s
to hesitate between pro-
tecting Julie and giving
her space for her own
decisions. She was stun-
ningly portrayed by Tilda
Swinton, actual mother
of Honor Swinton Byrne,
who played Julie in a
natural, charming way.
Tom Burke also gave an
interesting performance
as Anthony, an enigmatic
man, who slowly unfolds
to show his toxic person-
ality.
One of the biggest
strengths of the ﬁlm,
in my opinion, was the
camerawork. The story
was ﬁlmed with attention
to composition, while
light and shadow give it
an intimate atmosphere.
The choice of soundtrack,
together with blurry,
grainy images deﬁnitely
adds to the nostalgic feel.
There is something fas-
cinating about how quiet
and minimalistic this ﬁlm
is. Nevertheless, the story
is too vague and personal
to be truly engaging.
Your Father’s Murderer: A Letter to Zachary
S
ometimes it’s nice
to just have a good
cry at a movie,
cathartic even;
so with a quick Google
for some of the saddest
ﬁlms ever made, followed
by a little scrolling on
Reddit, I came across this
recommendation from
Ubertraquer with the bold
words “without a doubt
the most tragic and heart
wrenching ﬁlm”.
This documentary
follows ﬁlmmaker Kurt
Kuenne as he writes
a ‘letter’ to Zachary,
detailing the life of his
murdered father (Andrew
Bagby), and the people
he surrounded himself
with. With the promise
of being tragic, I was set
with a box of tissues and
a Hall and Oates album on
standby if things became a
little too much, yet I found
something lacking.
I won’t spoil it, but if I
were to tell you the entire
story of Andrew Bagby,
I’m sure I might elicit a
tear or two, but watching
this ﬁlm I couldn’t quite
bring myself to squeeze
one out, so what stopped
these tears from ﬂowing
here?
I’m not one to shy away
from crying in a ﬁlm. I
mean you’re listening to
someone who cried at
the end of Toy Story 3,
so I was expecting to be
this documentary felt
quite different. Where
Kuenne could’ve have
easily turned this into a
sob fest, playing on every
emotional trigger known,
he simply didn’t. Instead
of focusing entirely on the
bad, most of this ﬁlm felt
like a celebration of the
life of Andrew, focusing
on the lives of others he
touched; this is made
almost over abundantly
clear at the beginning as
we see something being
dropped into a pond with
the ripples of the water
spilling out. This isn’t the
only trope throughout the
movie though - littered
with record scratches
and choppy editing,
this feels like a very
‘homely’ movie, giving a
much more intimate and
personal feel to it. While
some might argue this is
poor ﬁlmmaking, it feels
very much in the ‘spirit’
of what this ﬁlm is trying
to achieve.
This is an extremely
personal ﬁlm, and while
watching it I couldn’t
escape the feeling that I
was intruding. This is not
a ﬁlm for a boy across the
Atlantic to be watching
slouched in bed, it simply
doesn’t do it justice. This
was a ﬁlm made for the
people that knew Andrew,
and while it has many
ﬂaws, it tells an honest
story about a tragic time
in these peoples lives, and
you can’t help but admire
it for that.

this is what I think might
