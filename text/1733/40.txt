HANGMAN
As delighted as we
always are here in the
NegaFelix offices to
receive your feedback,
opening the large
amounts of vitriolic
letters is digging
into our biting satire
writing hours. In
order to speed up
the reading process
we have provided a
template for you to
use when telling us
exactly what we have
done wrong. Simply

Editor-in-Chief
D
ear (Hacks/

Western Agi-
tators) of Felix,
I have been extremely
angry at the nature of
your coverage of (an
issue that I shout about a
lot). I have been a (loyal/
casual/virgin) reader of
the paper and have been
incredibly disappointed at
the drop in quality. I have
only the (utmost/barest)
respect for what you do
but your article last week
on (something I am overly
sensitive about) was really
beyond the pale.
I am of course an
unwavering advocate of
free speech and recognise
your right as a paper to
publish views that might
not be palatable to the
entire student body. It is in
this cut and thrust of disa-
greement that progress is
made. I particularly liked
the article you wrote,
criticising (the people/
idea I disagree with) and
thought it was a (very fair/
well considered) piece of
journalism. More of this
please! However, I fear
that this time, you have
gone too far.
This subject
(__________) is a very
complicated matter. In
fact it is so complicated
that often, people study-
ing the subject come to
the wrong conclusion. It
is therefore vital that we
prevent discussion of this
subject, to prevent people
reading about it and inevi-
tably forming an incorrect
opinion. It is therefore
very irresponsible of the
author to write this article
as they did not consider
the consequences of their
actions. The International
Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR)
says that free speech is
subject to certain restric-
tions for “the protection
of national security or of
public order.” An article
like this may cause people
to become so angry at the
author that they disturb
public order. It is therefore
vital that it is withdrawn
immediately.
I fear, however, that
only withdrawing the

article will not help the
author of the article un-
derstand the full weight
of their error. I would
humbly like to offer a
possible solution. The
author should be forced
to whip himself until the
entire student body passes
a two-thirds vote affirm-
ing that they are suitably
sorry.
If you are willing to
accept your error of your
ways I am sure we can
re-establish the relation-
ship of trust that was so
cruelly severed by your
unfortunate error.
Yours very earnestly
