n the previous article
it was established that
the state is a necessity
for capitalism, as
without a state private
property rights could not
be enforced. A state was
defined by political econ-
omist Max Weber as “a
political entity that main-
tains a monopoly on the
use of violence”. We dis-
cussed how this violence
is wielded by the state for
the enforcement of its’
laws and private property
rights domestically; but
how else is the state used
to prop up capitalism?
On the domestic front,
the judicial system has
allowed for interpreta-
tions of free speech law
that permit corporate
lobbying and funding.
In the US, the Supreme
Court’s ‘Citizens
United’ decision meant
that corporations could
freely spend money on
political communica-
tions as a form of ‘free
speech’ – allowing for
a strengthening of the
influence of corpora-
tions in liberal democ-
racies. This influence
affects everything from
domestic to foreign
policy.
The police play the
main part in exercising
a state’s power domes-
tically, and the military
does so globally. The
judicial system is meant
to hold these bodies and
individuals to account,
and does so with varying
levels of success. Often,
however, we see that the
police and military are
more or less kept protect-
ed by the judicial system
as it is in the state’s best
interests that these units
work together. When it
comes to racially biased
police brutality, or even
war crimes abroad,
the courts often acquit
police and military
officers involved with
these incidents despite
evidence of wrongdo-
ing..
The protection
afforded to the police
and military allows
them to operate more
or less freely on behalf
of the state to further
the state’s interests,
and thus capitalist
interests. For example,
strict immigration laws
create an underclass of
migrant workers that are
afforded less rights and
protections than non
-migrant workers. These
can include migrants
with strict visa condi-
tions as well as those
here illegally, and thus
they can often find
themselves in precarious
work. The creation of an
underclass of workers
gives employers a wider
choice on who they
should employ, and
with migrant workers
often willing to work
whatever they can and
for less, this can result
in wages falling across
the board. As noted in
the first article of this
series, lower wages
means more of the
value produced by the
workers goes towards
the capitalists as profits,
meaning the capitalists
benefit from having this
choice as a result of our
immigration laws.
Illegal immigration
will always exist and
people will resort to
more and more danger-
ous ways to get to other
countries, especially
with the refugee crisis
and with the impending
refugee crisis to come
as a result of climate
change. Therefore, the
state enacting strict
immigration laws is not
primarily to stop or limit
the number of people
coming here, but rather
to increase the number
of people that are not
afforded the same rights
and protections as
domestic workers have,
leading to falling wages
and more profit for cap-
italists.
When we hear about
refugee crises it’s also
important to ask why the
crises are happening in
the first place. In Latin
America and the Middle
to bring in profits for
American corporations.
In Latin America, this
was so common that the
term “Banana Republic”
came into use to describe
situations where this
occurred, such as in
Honduras with the US
corporation the United
Fruit Company. More
famously, in Iraq and
Syria, Western inter-
vention destabilised the
region leading to the
growth of Daesh and
the subsequent refugee
crisis. The intervention
proved profitable for
the defense and oil
industries. Later on, the
Iraq War was found to
be predicated on false
premises.
Capitalism has always
been a global system
that continuously seeks
out new resources and
new markets to expand
to. Foreign policy has
thus historically played
a key part in keeping
capitalism ticking. In the
next part we will expand
more on the history we
have discussed in this
article, particularly
in the context of free
markets, the global
economy, colonialism
and imperialism. Stay
tuned!

“Illegal
immigration
will always
exist and
people will
resort to more
and more
dangerous
ways to get
to other
countries”
East, we see a pattern
of American (and
British) intervention-
ism designed to install
governments that take a
more favourable foreign
policy and trading
approach to the United
States – sometimes at
the cost of overthrowing
democratically elected
leaders to install US
backed dictators. These
interventionist wars
cause instability in these
regions and harm local
economies in order
“Strict
immigration
laws create
an underclass
of migrant
workers”
The State we’re in…
After a short hiatus due to the General Election call last week, we return to the
third part of our 8-part political economic series: “What is Capitalism?”, where we
look at the State: police, the judicial system, and the military.
