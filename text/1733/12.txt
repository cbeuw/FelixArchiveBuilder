COMMENT
Charles Titmuss
Comment Editor
A
couple of weeks
ago, I wrote an
article concern-
ing Blizzard’s
censorship of pro-Hong
Kong protests entitled
“Companies in China.”
We have republished the
article in question to pro-
vide context to this issue.
Felix received a response
which I recommend you
look over before reading
this, on the pages preced-
ing this article.
The article is, quite
frankly, an insult to
logic. As opposed to
a reasonable point by
point refutation of
my own argument,
the author relies on a
sense of overwhelming
personal outrage. Un-
fortunately, anger does
not make an argument.
The overriding theme
of the article is that I
have overstepped the
bounds of free speech
by criticising China as
oppressive and mocking
Xi Jinping. Furthermore,
the article attempts to
clarify the errors in
Western attitudes with
regards to China. The
author has remarkably
gathered his compre-
hensive summary of
these attitudes in under
a month from the pres-
tigious and oft-cited
website “YouTube.” I
shall not deal with the
second section of the
article any further.
The author accuses
me of describing the
Chinese government
as oppressive. To be
completely clear, the
Chinese government
is oppressive. It is cur-
rently in the process of
interring an entire ethnic
group in re-education
camps. It is still widely
suspected of extracting
organs from its executed
political prisoners,
despite claiming that it
ended this practice a few
years ago. It prevents
access to the external
internet using a Great
Firewall and provides
instead an extensively
monitored and censored
alternative. This has
been used to control the
flow of information into
China as well as erasing
memories of past
events, such as a certain
massacre that definitely
didn’t happen in 1989.
There are almost count-
less examples of the
Chinese government
preventing those that
live within its borders
from exercising various
human rights, including
the right to free speech,
through insidious and
violent state coercion.
To a certain extent,
the Chinese government
is perfectly within its
rights to operate in
this manner. It is an
independent sovereign
state with a government
that certainly appears to
have the support of the
masses of China. In the
last few decades, the
Chinese system of gov-
ernment has overseen
rapid economic growth
and the uplifting of
many millions from
poverty. The issue arises
when China attempts
to extend censorship
of Chinese government
censorship to other sov-
ereign states, such as the
UK, in an effort to stem
international criticism.
This can manifest itself
in attempts to regulate
foreign discussion of
Hong Kong by applying
economic pressure to
companies that operate
within China. Or it could
involve attempting to
shut down mockery
directed at Xi Jinping
even though this type of
commentary is entirely
within the laws of the
UK.
Some Chinese nation-
als are certainly con-
sidered to have a part
to play in this strategy.
At the University of
Queensland, Australia,
clashes were sparked
when pro-Beijing coun-
ter-protesters ripped
up protest signs from
a peaceful pro-Hong
Kong demonstration.
Only last week, new
morality guidelines were
issued by the Chinese
government instructing
Chinese citizens to
defend China’s honor
when travelling abroad.
Although I am abso-
lutely not accusing the
again
3. (Optional) A PDF is
attached in response to
this article and I would
like it posted on school
newspaper. If any mod-
eration is necessary for
it to be posted, please
tell me.
Unfortunately, I will
not offer an apology. I
will also not promise
to not write about or
deliberately insult
China again. Neither
will the Editor-in-Chief
apologise on behalf of
Felix, and Felix will
continue to cover stories
or opinions about China
(in Politics or Comment
respectively).
What we will do is
what we have always
done: offer a platform to
anyone that would use it
to inform the rest of the
students at the Universi-
ty of your opinion under
the proper operation
of Freedom of Speech
in the UK. Anyone can
write for us and they
will be published, pro-
viding we’re not bored
of the topic as we hope
we’ve shown today. Just
be coherent next time.
On a personal note,
I am rather delighted
by the response. It is
not very often that it
is demanded of one to
apologise to the entire
nation of China. I was
worried that I had lost
the ability to piss people
off. I shall leave you,
dear reader, with this:
Free Tibet, Taiwan
Number One, Glory
to Hong Kong. And of
course, make Xi Jinping
Winnie the Pooh again.

“New morality
guidelines
were issued
instructing
Chinese
citizens to
defend China’s
honour
abroad”
author of acting on
behalf of his govern-
ment, this article would
surely please the CCP
back in Beijing.
The author sent
Felix the following list
of demands, copied
verbatim from the email:
1. An official apology
by Felix and the
comment editor Charles
Titmuss to the Chinese
community at Imperial
on school newspaper,
twitter, and Facebook
2. Promise that such
case will not happen
