Albert Camus’ The Myth of Sisyphus
“There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide.”
BOOKS
Jia Qi Tan
A
lbert Camus
begins with a
strong state-
ment, “There
is but one truly serious
philosophical problem
and that is suicide,” which
immediately catches my
attention. My problem
with philosophy has
always been its irrele-
vance, that is, whether
you think one way or the
other has little effect on
how the world actually
plays out. The very core
of metaphysics lies within
abstract beliefs and logic
and is essentially “beyond
physics.” While I see the
appeal of philosophy,
its inconsequentiality
lingers. However, Camus
takes a turn when he
deems this question the
most important, because
of the definitive act it
entails, either living for
a purpose or committing
suicide for not finding a
reason to live.
“Absurdism”
“Absurdism” as defined
by Camus is the paradox
between one’s urgent need
for unity to make sense
out of this world and the
world not making sense.
Centuries of religion and
philosophies have placed
God-given meaning as
the sole purpose of exist-
ence. Taking it to the far
extreme, when we live for
our God-given meaning,
consider if we are stripped
away from that meaning,
is suicide then necessary?
One metaphor Camus
often uses is in a world
divested of meaning, a
man with existentialist
thoughts may feel in
exile. He then gives
sketches of how feelings
of absurdism may strike,
at times of weariness
of mechanical life, the
inevitability of time, or
simply the “denseness and
strangeness of the world.”
It is during these moments
that our consciousness
awakes and forces us to
contemplate whether life
has meaning at all.
An absurd reasoning:
philosophical suicide
It is notable that Camus
explores the approach of
other existentialist philos-
ophiesatthetimein-depth,
including Chestov’s and
Kierkegaard’s leap of
faith into God in hopes
of explaining everything
irrational as well as
Jasper’s and Husserl’s
quest after transcendence,
all of which falls into
the trap of reconciliation
something entirely irrec-
oncilable. Absurdism is
defined by the contradic-
tory truths of one’s pursuit
of meaning and the
universe’s utter silence
on the subject matter. To
apply transcendence on
it, either through hope or
blind faith, is to escape
the paradox. Clearly,
Camus is dissatisfied with
all answers that attempt
to deny one or the other
piece of the paradox.
Therefore the question
of facing the absurd with
consciousness remains.
“All of which
falls into
the trap of
reconciliation
something
entirely
irreconcilable”
Revolt, freedom, and
passion
The section on absurd
freedom, where Camus
redefines freedom in the
context of absurdity and
arrives at a conclusion on
how to live with absurdi-
ty, is a personal favourite
of mine. His definition
of freedom is essentially
the photo-opposite of the
traditional philosophical
definition, where one
has the choice to decide
on the basis of values
held by that particular
person. Camus’s version
essentially disregards the
values, which he claims
will form preconceptions
where one ought to follow.
To achieve true absurd
freedom, one would have
to abandon those pre-ex-
isting expectations and
live life as is.
This leads us into his
proposed way to deal
with existentialism and
the conclusion at which
he has arrived--revolt,
freedom, and passion. To
Camus, suicide is merely
an acceptance of the
conflict, whereas living
the absurd is revolting
against the absurd. With
the freedom as defined
above, one must also live
passionately, continue
challenging the world,
living in the present and
living life to the fullest
whilst recognising the
futility of it all. As Camus
puts it, “Being aware of
one’s life, one’s revolt,
one’s freedom, and to the
maximum, is living, and to
the maximum.” It is rather
interesting and delightful
to see how Camus moves
from existentialism to a
conclusion that resembles
the cliches of many self-
help books.
Sketches of the absurd
man
It is no surprise that
as a womaniser himself
Camus would choose
to draw examples from
the seductive Don Juan.
Contrary to common
claims that he’s after some
transcending true love,
Camus proposes that Don
Juan simply enjoys the
experience of seducing
and devotes his life doing
that and only that, despite
recognising its meaning-
lessness. One example is
stage actors embodying
this philosophy by living
out the intensity and
variety of life, unbur-
dened by fame and en-
deavouring in the fleeting
joy. Another example he
gives is the conquerors,
who acknowledge that
“action is in itself useless”
and is “fully aware of
the grandeur.” While
including such sketches
provides physical forms
of innocent, amoral
beings fully embracing
the absurd, I would
say that protagonists in
Camus’s other works like
The Plague better repre-
sent Camus’s vision of an
absurd man.
The Myth of Sisyphus
The perfect embodi-
ment of an absurd heroic
figure would be Sisyphus,
who is punished to roll a
rock uphill only to watch
it fall, and repeating that
till eternity. Camus is
especially interested in
Sisyphus’s consciousness
at the very moment that
the rock rolls down before
Sisyphus continues to
push the rock up. It is Si-
syphus’s state of lucidity
at the moment that sets
him free from his fate.
As Camus puts it, “The
struggle itself towards the
heights is is enough to fill
a man’s heart. One must
imagine Sisyphus happy.”
Final thoughts
Strictly speaking, The
Myth of Sisyphus is not a
work of philosophy but
rather Camus’s attempt of
building a framework on
how to live. In this sense,
it is not peculiar that he
has arrived at the conclu-
sion that he did. Although
he left many questions
unanswered, his response
is certainly a pragmatic
answer to the continual
search for meaning. I
like that Camus himself
fully embodies his own
philosophy of the ironic
blend of detachment and
passionate-living, and
that is perhaps the best a
philosopher can do.
