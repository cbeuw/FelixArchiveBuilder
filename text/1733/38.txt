aims and objectives, the
constitution and the law.
There was much debate
on whether to introduce
an elected post-graduate
trustee, with valid points
raised on both sides. Ap-
parently the sabbs don’t
think that post-grads are
engaged and think they
actually hate ICU. It’s
a well known fact that
it’s undergrads that shit
on ICU daily - because
they shit on us! Though,
saying that, were starting
to have more and more
positive interactions with
the Union staff and some
sabbatical officers, who
seem to be listening to us
more. Let’s hope that they
deliver on their promises;
watch this space.
Now, Council also has
certain sub-boards, who,
after a rather unanimous
vote, have ownership of
policies (things which
Union enacts to ensure
things run).
CSPB, or Clubs, Soci-
eties and Projects Board,
which is due to be split
into “Sports Hub” for
sports clubs and “Socie-
ties and Projects Board”
for other clubs. No one
really knows how yet,
though.
G&I (GIB, GID no
one really cares what it’s
called) - the Abhijay Sood
Show “and on tonight’s
show - the Strategy™”
ERB - Education and
Representation Board
(this is academic reps,
you’re at University to get
an education, right?)
CWB - Community
& Welfare Board - this
is where we decide that
diversity is good, but
nothing gets done about it.
SSB - Service & Sus-
tainability Board. This
deals with the shops, bars
(which have become wank
recently) and trying to
make Imperial a greener
place.
It’s strange to also
pontificate that we, the
CGCU, are a Union in
our own right too. Despite
what ICU say, we do stuff
like run the Academic and
Wellbeing Rep Network
for you. We also manage
our 17 Clubs and Socs -
hosting what is termed a
Management Group, MG.
Our first MG meeting
featured a lot of talking
about the fiasco that was
Freshers’ Fair and what
we can do to help mitigate
the damages.
In other news we’ve
also met with our alumni
association - the CGCA
(City & Guilds College
Association), their young
members’ division and
their charitable arm, the
OCT (Old Centralians
Trust). These people have
a large amount of money
they wish to invest in
students and fund various
things like undergraduate
and post-graduate travel
awards.
OCT and CGCA - YGD
stuffs too. So if you have
a big project that is FUN
or abroad that you’d like
some help with, email
guilds.alumni@ic.ac.uk
or visit the website over
at cgca.org.uk. You can
also become a student
member for free and meet
high-flying alumni at the
events that are hosted.
It’s mighty strange
how we now consider
things like this fun, while
we consider tasks like
doing our degrees to be
mundane and boring.
All we can say is that
these roles have aged us -
though perhaps that’s just
daily exposure to Tom’s
corrosive humour?
Next week you can
hopefully expect little
snippets from each of
our committee - they’re
a lit bunch of people who
come from a variety of
courses and backgrounds!
T
his week, Tom is
getting serious
- a man on a mis-
sion, and Fatima
is her usual excellent self.
We’re co-writing this, so
bear with us - we haven’t
had to write an article
together since we were
mere Guildsheet editors
last year.
We apologise to those
who felt that Tom wasn’t
using the column for CU
stuff, and after 40 hours of
Panopto over the weekend
he’s finally got his life
together enough to focus
on the corruption in the
Union. Correction - he’s
now ill; we’re hoping
it’s not mumps. Bloody
drama queen...
We’ve had a busy
start to term, with a
load of meetings, and a
huge Guilds event. Last
Saturday saw us welcome
some 300 engineers into
the CGCU at our annual
Welcome Dinner. Thank
you to all who came,
and the volunteers who
put in so much time to
make it happen. It was
a great evening for all
who attended - that being
said, Tom struggles to
remember exactly what
happened in the second
half. Be careful kids,
drink responsibly.
Now onto the crap-
tonne of meetings our
committee have been busy
attending, one of them
being Union Council.
We’re going to give you a
quick run-down, Guilds-
style.
Thefirstvotethatwasn’t
mind-numbingly boring
was about whether we
should elect a post-grad-
uate trustee. For those of
you who don’t know, the
Board of Trustees is the
sovereign and govern-
ing body of the Union,
overseeing Council and
ensuring their actions are
in keeping with charitable
