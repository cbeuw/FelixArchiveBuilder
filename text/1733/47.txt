H
aving trained
hard for 5
weeks, the
30-men strong
Immortals squad were up
bright and early at 9 am
on Sunday for the long
coach journey to the home
of the Kent Falcons. The
Falcons are a big rival
to the team, so this was
a great chance to set a
strong start to the season.
The game started off
strong. However, the
Falcons were the first
to score and go 7-0 up.
Despite this, some quick
scramble drills from
Sebastiano “Fade = Life”
Zane brought the team
two touchdowns, making
the score 14-14 just before
the end of the half. The
squad was determined to
make a strong start to the
season -nothing would
stop them- so much so that
Punter “Who’s Daniel?”
Loughran made a solid
gain with one of the
Falcons’ defensive backs
hanging off him. Both
sides fought hard for the
rest of the half, meaning
there was little separat-
ing the two with the score
being 22-14 at half time.
After the break both the
competition were back on
as everyone was fighting
to seize the final victory.
The Immortals were
giving it their all, and
it seemed as though
there was a chance for a
comeback when Killian
“Concussion King”
Gymrek intercepted the
ball and caused disruption
to the Kent offensive
drive; however, we were
unable to capitalize
upon this. The team kept
going and Offensive
Lineman Justino “Seeing
is Optional” Rodrigues
delivered what some
would call a gut punching
performance and held the
Falcons at bay for a while.
However, injuries and
fatigue began to fall upon
the players and the loss of
two thirds of the starting
Defensive Line meant
that Kent began to pull
ahead and amounted
to the Falcons scoring
several more touchdowns
and a safety.
Although everyone
fought hard, the team
would like to congratulate
the game MVPs for their
strong performances.
They are as follows:
Rookie MVP was Ian
“The Screamer” Tsang,
Line MVP was Jack “No
ACL’s” Benham, Defence
MVP was Seif “Jacob
2.0” Girgis, Offence MVP
was Ben “Ints Thrown >
0” O’Brien and finally the
Overall MVP was Tom
“Bad Father” Smith.
The final score came
to 42-14 to the Falcons.
Despite the score line,
the Immortals have a lot
to be proud of from this
first game of the season
and set a very positive and
hopeful tone for games to
come.
The next Immortals
game is against Queen
Marys’ Vipers on Sunday
the 10th November.
