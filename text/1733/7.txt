A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
the potential need to
change those roles very
shortly after new staff
join?
Tom: The Student Activi-
ties Manager, Iain Pullar,
has been working on this
sort of thing – less me.The
new Head of Student Ex-
perience, Tom Newman,
has come in now and so
we’re also looking at the
directorate as a whole,
which can affect things on
a Union-wide scale.
We’ve found ourselves in
the situation where we do
not understand everything
that we do, and the current
structure hopefully is an
improvement. It doesn’t
mean a restructuring, it’s
about looking at efficien-
cies. That might require
new staff to learn new
skills, that weren’t in their
original job descriptions –
but the major stakeholder,
and our major focus, is
the students. We need
people in those posts.
We’re hoping to hire
people who are really
interested by the things
they’ll be doing, with the
right mindset, who will
put students first – and
thus will be on board with
improving these efficien-
cies. We definitely will
keep all of this in mind,
and will support them.
We don’t do that enough
as it is – we have high
staff turnover. It would be
short-sighted to say it’s
just as a result of being
a Union, and we want to
be an exceptional place
to work so people want to
stay, and we’re not there
yet. We can do things like
training and giving staff a
sense of joint ownership
with students over their
projects. We need to
empower staff to deliver
the vision we have, so we
can do our job – which I
see as facilitate student
activities.
Students can do a bunch
of stuff better than we
can, Imperial students are
smart and capable – we
should facilitate that with
systems development,
processes, consultation,
rather than ‘providing a
service’. My involvement
with CSPs has aided
and complemented my
academic experience at
uni, and my professional
future, and I hope other
students in CSPs would
agree.
Felix: Okay. So what’s
happening with Ethos
– a new gym has been
opened downstairs, and
students are confused
about whether they will
be charged to use it or
not. Can we get some
clarity? Why was there
such confusion in the
way it was communicat-
ed?
Here, Tom offered a
detailed explanation
of the new structure of
specifically sports clubs
in the Union, the Sports
Hub, Move Imperial, the
College’s Sports Board,
and other related organ-
isations. For more infor-
mation, see papers from
last year’s Union Council.
Tom: A new CrossFit gym
called SW7 was opened on
the ground floor, and was
funded by the President’s
Fund. What the email said
“the gym is specifically
run as a functional class
program with four main
concepts, as well as being
open to existing members
outside of the program.”
The members it’s refer-
ring to are not the SW7
members, it’s members of
Ethos. So if you have the
membership to the gym at
Ethos, you do get access
to SW7 with no further
fees – but you don’t have
access to the classes or the
MyZone technology. For
those things specifically,
you have to pay £50 a
month, which I believe
is open to the public as
well like Ethos is. So it is
an extra gym space being
provided at no extra cost
to students, so long as
classes are not being run
in there at the time.
Move Imperial have
recently told me that since
opening SW7, they’ve
only had waiting times
at Ethos once as students
will just go to SW7 when
Ethos is full. Before that,
wait times were a regular
problem. It’s a really
positive improvement.
The wording of the email
could have been better,
but hopefully this clears
it up!
Felix: The new structure
of the Sports Hub and
Move Imperial and how
these decision-making
structures are set up
seems to be quite confus-
ing to students thus far.
Do you feel it’s obscur-
ing clarity about, for
example, who to contact
about problems or where
funding is coming from?
Tom: The Sports Hub is
a project that’s still being
phased in, and we’re
still figuring out a lot of
the logistics, like how
financially it will work.
It won’t be clear right
now. The idea is to have
a parallel structure to the
old CSPB specifically for
sports clubs. The papers
submitted to Council
last year give example
structures – which are
not set in stone, but are
currently being looked
at. For example, we now
have management groups
for different sports clubs,
such as Martial Arts or
Team Court. It’s the same
volunteers doing these
roles, but creating a new
parallel structure to fa-
cilitate their needs better
and work efficiently with
Move Imperial to do that.
So as an example of what
we’re looking at with
the phasing – which is
overseen by meetings of
the old CSPB structure –
is that if we make massive
savings with the Sports
Hub structure, do they
need the same amount of
funding for it and if so
how can that funding then
be fairly redistributed?
So hopefully I can talk
more about it next time
we do an interview!
Felix: What else have you
been working on?
Tom: One thing is the first
point of my manifesto,
which is looking at the
new sports complex – spe-
cifically, working with the
College on consultation
about Heston and Har-
lington. So, the College
– specifically Campus
Services – are conducting
a review of their facilities
across campuses. They’ve
looked at Heston and
Harlington, the main
sports grounds, and think
that Heston is not fit for
purpose and are consider-
ing selling it.
They’re really keen this
year, after it hasn’t been
done at other times, to
consult with students
about this sort of decision
– and they said that the
sale wouldn’t go ahead
without student agree-
ment. We held a joint
consultation workshop
with Move Imperial, and
all the clubs who use the
space got an individual
invite along with all the
clubs in general receiving
an open invitation, along
with other representa-
tives.
The facilities at Harling-
ton have been renewed
to the tune of around
£700,000 over the last
year, including renovat-
ing pitches, improving
changing rooms, and so
on. They’re steps in the
right direction and there’s
a strong desire to see it
through and continue
improving Harlington.
The sale of Heston would
mean a lot of teams
shifting to Harlington, as
well, and there have been
issues with more clubs
being at Harlington – for
example, Heston had
better football pitches.
The feedback was that so
long as there is invest-
ment into Harlington,
there isn’t a strong feeling
against selling Heston –
there isn’t a sentimental
attachment as such. But
it will be a big ongoing
project, including looking
at things like transport
strategies for students to
get there.
Felix: That’s very
positive to hear. This
all touches – almost
everything we have
talked about – on
the space problem at
Imperial, which we’ve
covered a lot this
year. What are your
thoughts on moving to
a multi-campus univer-
sity, and how this might
affect both CSP commu-
nities as well as logistical
operation of the Union
as a whole?
Tom: It’s an interest-
ing question and one
we maybe do not ask
ourselves enough. I’m
leading a project looking
into the space that CSPs
use, and it’s huge – it’s
funded by the Harlington
Trust, and involves people
at the College as well.
This might be something
to be looked at there.
Felix: You were talking
about how much CSPs
benefitted you – so I’m
asking, what are your
feelings about it? For
example, the idea of
having a DPCS for each
campus, or having CSPs
be fragmented between
different campuses.
Tom: As DPCS I think
it’s really exciting! There
are a lot of potential that
would come with having
multiple campuses,
although there would also
be great challenges. With
the new Head of Student
Experience, we’re
meeting with key student
volunteers from different
management groups and
even down to the level of
specific CSPs that operate
in unique ways – such
as Felix – over the next
few weeks to talk about
various things. One
question we are asking
is whether people have
a sense of community at
Imperial, and what you
find is that within constit-
uent unions they find it
in the constituent union,
within clubs it’s in their
club, and so on. So you
raise a good point – for
a lot of people maybe it
would affect their sense
of community. For some
clubs – such as those
which operate out of ‘core
hours’ – it’s maybe less of
a problem.
We need to look at how
we deal with things like
transport and communi-
cation across campuses,
as often right now we
are quite South Kens-
ington-focused, and that
modularity is something
I began this interview by
noting as a problem. That
applies even now, with
other campuses that we
don’t do enough to work
with, and we’ll have to
look at those problems
too when we tackle White
City.
We need more of a
presence in these other
campuses. Even right
now, we have some
presence in for example
Reynolds, but I don’t
think that’s enough. I’m
planning to work there
once every two or three
weeks to get involved, get
to know people, and get
to grips with their specific
issues – whereas right
now we’re dependent on
that structure feeding in,
rather than personally
having a presence.
Felix: Do you think the
way things are set up
with the medics right
now – for example,
having a full-time
sabbatical officer specif-
ically to address many
of their unique issues
as they’re often spread
across other campuses
– might be a model
to emulate? Having a
“White City” sabbatical
officer, for example?
Tom: It depends on
whether the needs at dif-
ferent campuses are very
different. Like, currently
Silwood have their own
structures that then feed in
to the centralised Union,
so perhaps that would
work.
