F
or those of you
that live on
Instagram and
have never met a
cheeto-eating basement
dweller, Blizzard are a
gamingcompanythathave
developed some of the
most popular titles over
the last 20 years including
Starcraft, Hearthstone
and, of course, World of
Warcraft. These games are
popular all over the world.
Starcraft launched the
e-sports industry; World
of Warcraft is perhaps
one of the most popular
and enduring games the
world has ever seen. The
perception of Blizzard
was generally favorable
for many years. This
week Blizzard managed
a PR fuck-up of epic
gamer proportions, when
it banned multiple people
that showed support to the
protesters in Hong Kong.
A Hearthstone player
going by the name of
Blitzchung gave an in-
terview on a Taiwanese
programme in a gas mask
and shouted pro-Hong
Kong slogans. He was
later banned for breaching
Blizzard’s community
rules speciﬁcally the
rule against offending
“a portion or group of
the public, or otherwise
damag[ing] Blizzard’s
image.” Additionally,
the two casters on the
livestream were also
disavowed by Blizzard
as a result of the player’s
words, which seems rather
unfair given that they had
no idea what the person
they were interviewing
was actually going to
say – that is, without
assuming prescience.
To add insult to injury,
members of an inter-col-
legiate Hearthstone team
were immediately banned
after they held up a piece
of cardboard reading
“Support Hong Kong.”
Both of these actions
have gone down like a
lead balloon in the wider
gaming community that
has interpreted these
actions as efforts to
ensure that the company
does nothing to offend
mainland Chinese sensi-
bilities at the expense of
freedom of speech. Reddit
communities such as r/
Blizzard and r/Hearth-
stone have been dominat-
ed with some high-quality
memes showing Blizzard
as China’s little bitch. Go
and take a look. Further-
more, furious Blizzard
associates and employees
have responded by dis-
tancing themselves from
the company or covering
up a rather ironic plaque
in Blizzard HQ that reads
“all voices matter.”
This issue ties into
wider problems that
Western companies have
experienced when oper-
ating with the Chinese
market in mind. In the
US, a National Basketball
Association manager
tweeted in support of
Hong Kong and immedi-
ately faced the wrath of
China’s state broadcaster
who threatened to pull
their contract with the
NBA. NBA representa-
tives rapidly rowed back
and disassociated them-
selves from the tweet.
Google came under ﬁre
for “Project Dragonﬂy”,
a search engine designed
to work behind the Great
Firewall. During the
project, it surreptitiously
dropped one of its key
mottos, “Don’t be Evil.”
China possesses
economic might that most
nations, bar the US, can
only dream of. The past
and present of Chinese
economic development
is intertwined with the
Chinese government, a
one-party autocracy that
is considerably more
oppressive than others.
With this clash of cultures
in mind, companies
It is important to point
out, perhaps controver-
sially, China is rightly free
to operate as it wishes.
China is a sovereign state,
and the West should not
attempt to interfere with
the Chinese government.
Fiddling with sovereignty
has been a terrible experi-
ment for the last 20 years
of Western foreign policy,
leading to widespread
disaster in almost every
case. However, the current
position of Western
companies presents two
issues, appeasement and
abetment.
In order to maintain
their access to the markets
in China, companies such
as Blizzard are willing to
appease China by silenc-
ing critics in the West
in return for potential
economic beneﬁts. This
is not acceptable. China
must not be allowed to
leverage power through
economic manipulation
of ethically malleable
companies.
Companies must also
not abet China. Compa-
nies such as Microsoft
must accept moral re-
sponsibility for aiding the
Chinese government’s
goal of information
totalitarianism over its
population. Companies
should avoid working on
projects that are likely to
be ethically dubious and if
they do, should be forced
to accept some form of
penalty. Perhaps a moral
tax as a practical means of
dissuasion.
Companies have an
opportunity to do the right
thing. They won’t, but
wouldn’t it be good if they
did.

migrating from the West
are often faced with the
prospect of having to com-
promise whatever ethical
code they may have used
in order to make a proﬁt,
hence Project Dragonﬂy.
Other examples of com-
panies wilfully ignoring
the ethical implications
of their work include
Microsoft, with their de-
velopment of AI for facial
recognition in concert
with Chinese partners. AI
for image recognition can
be used for multiple nefar-
ious purposes of surveil-
lance and repression, but
the attraction of wealth is
more than enough to settle
whatever moral qualms
Microsoft may have had.
China is now a world
leader in this technology.
