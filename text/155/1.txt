No. 155 TUESDAY, 24th JANUARY 1961. Price 4d.

At the first Union Meeting of this ses-
sion there was a considerable and interest-
ed discussion on the charity to which the
proceeds of this year's l.C. Carnival were
to be given. The Chairman of the Carnival
Committee asked for helpers to coma
forward, and, for the whole affair, there
seemed to be a welcome enthusiasm.
It is now January, and the work ol
the Carnival Committee is being hindered
by the fact that not enough people are
coming forward and offering their services.
Everybody realises that the average
student is kept hard pressed by the dem-
ands of the academic work, but I doubt
if there are any who are so overpowered
that they have no leisure and not even
one or two hours per week during which
they could be doing valuable work for the
l.C. Carnival.
Remember this is OUR Carnival I It is
the one occasion that we have to remind
the people in Kensington and Westminster
that OUR noise, energy and vivacity can
be put to good uses. It is only by the
effort of the student body as a whole that
WE can succeed.
I would ask you all to look over your
activities for the succeeding weeks of this
term and whether you could not spend a
little time helping our already overworked
Carnival Committee.

In Holy Week, commercing 26th oi
27th March and finishing Saturdaj
1st April.
This walk is in aid of the Oxford
Committee for Famine Relief and
will also advertise the Imperial
College Charity Carnival. The dift
tances covered each day will not be
too severe, neither will be the hours
We hope to have full press and tele
vision coverage. The Y.H.A. did this
last year and had a most enjoyable
time, even having dancing and
another energetic activities in the
evenings. At the moment I cannot say
where we will be staying; if we have
a large number of people we shall
probably stay in village halls. So do
bring your friends along and have a
good holiday, while collecting money
for the refugees.

Tony Biggins (right) and Phil Logan?
They're going to be doing a 24 hour
domino-playing marathon for the Carnival.
What are you going to be doing for it?
Terry Clarke Beverly Bradford
KNOW SOMEBODY YOU'D LIKE
TO BE CARNIVAL QUEEN
Because all you have to do is
send her photo to the Hon. Secret-
ary of the Carnival Committee via
the Union rack with her name,
someone else's name and your own
as proposers, and a short account
of why you think she should be the
Carnival Queen. If she is chosen by
the panel of judges (as yet unchosen)
she will be crowned during the Car-
nival Ball, and will ride in the Car-
nival procession. She will also win
a prize. If she hasn't a photopraph
of herself then we can have it taken.
Sounds too easy, doesn't it? Wei!,
why not propose someone?
THIS CONTEST IS OPEN TO ANT
GIRL CONNECTED WITH THE
COLLEGE.
For an example of what's wanted,
read on.
CARNIVAL QUEEN No. 1.
Beverly Bradford
Proposed by Finlay Macpherson
and Dick Lewis.
Finlay writes:
Camlvores-Man-Eater.
"My Dear, she's a mathemati-
cian."
"NOt How frightful; How delight-
ful!"
"Yes, of course that means she's
one of the oool calculating type. Now
take that Josephine..."
Uufortunately thel above pair of
middle-class conservative, bridge-
playing, battle-axes sipping their
morning coffee were wrong. Female
Mathematicians seem to be typically
feminine, they never seem to learn
to apply {he logic of mathematics
to non-mafhematical fields; they
remain typically illogical.
Beverley Bradford is a second
year mathematician. The Maths.
Dept. have a reputation for getting
more than a fair share of good-look-
ing women students and Beverley
more than maintains this tradition
Last year she was Queen of Jezebel
and hence has experienced, success-
fully, without undue disaster, the
rigour and changes of being a Queen.
CARNIVAL QUEEN No. 2.
Terry Clarke
Proposed by Jim Carter and Ann
Hodnett
and Jim writes (?)
MYSTERY _ WHAT?
MYSTERY _ WHERE?
MYSTERY — WHO?
MISS TERRY CLARKE
FOR
CARNIVAL QUEEN (of course)
Although illogical, she is still clever,
she shows no favouritism and always
seems to have an air of slight
mystery, or perhaps my glasses had
fogged up. Her skill in argument
is superb and should be very useful
during Carnival Week should par-
leys with constables about minor
fracases be neoessary. Why, only
this afternoon when discussing her
nomination she had me convinced
that it was I who was being elected
not her. However, I've decided to
stand down and hence leave you no
suitable alternative but to vote for
that experienced candidate. Miss
Beverley Bradford, as Carnival
Queen.

HI from SI
At the beginning of this term the Car-
nival Committee jumped up on its horse
and galloped off in all directions. After this
outburst of poly-direotionalism or what
might be called going around in circles,
we rapidly come to the conclusion that
most of our tentative plans were exactly
as we expected — still tentative. We
then, after declaring the situation a state
of emergency, dialled 999 only to learn
that this was one emergency they could
not handle. Not to be disappointed we
continued to run around in circles, which
was not enthsy a bad thing as we met
more people who eventually combined to
form the present oommittee. The commit-
tee now, following a metamorphose of
mono-directionalism, can report with more
oertainty the plans of the Second Annual
Charity Carnival.
The Carnival Week will commence
Monday, May 8th, and terminate Satur-
day, May 13th at the fete in Princes Gard-
ens. During the week there will be ap-
propriate publicity stunts, a domino mara-
thon, and a hop. Friday night is absolutely
TL must in your plans as it is the Carnival
Fancy Dress Ball, with 2 orchestras,
dancing in the quad., an excellent buffet,
some challenging displays (What's on
your partner's mind, and a Kiss-o-meter),
and the gala crowning of the Carnival
Queen. An evening you'll not only
enjoy, but always remember.
On Saturday the procession consisting
of 18 decorated floats will start r
>
t
1 o'el.-vk, and will go through the streets
of Kensington, and upon its return the
fete will be officially opened. The fete
this year will prove enjoyable with a
large array of booths including the 2 dis-
plays from the Ball as well a
B "Can little
Genee guess your sex, and Which is
stronger — He or She."
Prior to the Carnival Week there will
be Super-Snacks every week, eaoh repre-
senting a different nationality- and each
providing different forms of entertain-
ment.
To keep up to date with the latest
happenings in the plans for the Carnival
continue to buy Felix as in eaoh edition
there will be a Carnival Page. Also watch
for the Carnival Magazine — edited by
Howard Glover, and published by
Pheonix.
However, with all this festivity we must
remember that the primary reason for the
Carnival is to collect money for the Oxford
Oommittee for Famine Relief. Sfrne it
is your Carnival we are sure that you
will help the college reach its objeotive.
We need YOU NOW to help to sell ad-
vertising space in the Carnival Magazine,
to sell raffle tickets, and to help with
door to door collecting. We need your sup-
port both in manpower and financially if
possible, as we must remember that al-
though we live in comfort others in this
world are dying of starvation; and every-
thing we do, regardless of how small or
how large, is necessary as we must;

THEMSELVES.
