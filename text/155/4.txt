SHOOTING
MET. POLICE BEATEN.
The fortunes of the Rifle Club this sea-
son have been varied, mainly due to failure
of team members to all hit form at the
same time.
The standing and kneeling teams are
doing well this year and if they maintain
form could possible win the league.
The standard of the pistol shooting is
even higher this year, although the 'A'
team is likely to be beaten by a very
good Q.M.C. team.
A notable achievement this year was
the defeat of the Metropolitan Polioe. Al-
though only a friendly match we have
been trying to win for some years and we
at last succeeded with scores of 1452-1450
out of 1500. Quite a close result.
%r*jr TABLE TENNIS
HOPES FOR PROMOTION.
In the last week of the autumn term the
first team scored notable success in beat-
ing C.E.M.I., one of the best teams in
the league, 8-1 to gain a place in the semi-
final of the eup. The score, however,
hardly does justice to C.E.M. who gave
our players some very good games. Our
record in the league is exceedingly good,
and all our teams still stand a fair chance
of promotion, though our first team have
bad their first defeat at the hands of
Woolwich who won 7-3.
With half sessional exams, coming along
I can only hope that players won't let these
interfere with their table tennis too much.
If our strength is depleted by several
players over this period then this will be
a serious handicap to us when teams are
in the running for promotion.
RECORDS MAINTAINED ...
I would like to draw to the the attention
of the club the fact that the Concert Hall
will be available for play together with
the gym on Monday evenings commencing
January 23rd. I would also like to appeal
for support from team members during
this busy period.
The 1st and mixed teams remain un-
beaten. The 1st team had an interesting
match with a cosmopolitan Northern Poly,
side before emerging the winners by 6-3.
The 1st team opened this term success-
fully with a 7-2 win over Chelsea. The
score could easily have been closer, because
our third pair, after a very shaky win over
their opposite number woke, up (it was
9.30 a.m. start) to beat the opposing 1st
pair and I.C.'s thin man Sarfraz Ahmad,
thought it was a friendly match until he
had played the first game.
BOXING
U.L. CHAMPIONSHIPS.
On Thursday evening December 8th,
I.C. were again runners-up to a numeric-
ally stronger Guy's Hospital team, in the
U.L. Boxing Championships.
P. Sribbribadah R.C.S.) and G. Torke
(C. & G.), were weight winners and J.
Farfield (R.S.M.) reached the heavy-
weight final.
RECTOR'S CUP.
This year the competition will take place
on February 3rd in the I.C. Union Concert
Hall. Eager competitors are advised to con-
tact their constituent college captains;
their names can be found on the club
board in the Union entrance hall.
The college individual championships
will be decided on the same evening. Each
college will be allowed to enter two boxers
at each weight. Weights limits will shortly
be posted, and lunch time training sessions
arranged.

FIRST TEAM TOPS DIVISION.
The I.C. 1st XI had a good victory in
their last league match of the Autumn
term. Playing away against a much-im-
proved Battersea side they won 5-5. This
win took the 1st XI to the top of the
Premier Division of the University league.
On the same day the 2nd XI played U.C.
in the Cup. This was the third time the
two sides had met in the competition, and
the result was yet another draw (3-3). The
3rd XI had a close league match with Kings
2nd XI at Harlington. The result was a
3-2 win for I.C. The I.C. 4th XI was also
engaged in a league fixture. The match
was against Battersea 2nd XI at Harling-
ton and the home side ran out 3-2 win-
ners. The I.C. 5th XI, playing well, had
a convincing 6-1 win against Birkbeek n,
while the I.C. VI, also playing in a league
match drew 2-2 with Batttersea HI.
The only match on 14th December was
a 1st XI friendly match against Reading
University at Harlngton. Although the I.C.
team was drawing 3-3 at one stage, the
University proved too strong for the home
side and added four further goals to their
score. The final result was thus 7-4 to
Reading.
On the first Wednesday of term Mines
played the R.C.S. in the Technology Cup.
For most of the match Mines played the
better football, and were unfortunate to
only draw, 2-2. The I.C. 7th XI playing
the School of Pharmacy lost in a high-
scoring match. The result was 9-5.
On Saturday 14th the I.C. 1st XI con-
solidated their position at the top of the
Premier Division by defeating Chelsea Col-
lege 3-1. The I.C. scorers were Olding,
Codling and Mousse-Jones. The 2nd XI
put up a dismal performance agaist King's
III in an away match; thie result was a
5-0 win to King's. The 5th XI although
down 5-2 at one stage, rallied well to win
6-5 in an exciting league match against
Chelsea U. The I.C. 7th team lost 16-1
to Peel Institution, although Eddie Fersht
informs that the I.C. team was worth at
least a draw.
Next Wednesday is an important day for
the 1st XI who /ire engaged In the quarter
finals of the University Cup against Gold-
smith's College. The college is still well
represented in the University group. Collin
Casemore, the University outside-right, has
recently been selected to play for Sussex.
Basil Jarne, Wales and University captain,
hopes to have the plaster removed from
his leg in the three weeks time..

RUGBY
REVIEW
by Gordon Margretts
During the past term the rugby teams
of I.C. have gone from strength to
strength. Beoause of the great response of
the freshers at the eommeneemert of the
season and due to their continued support
with the 'old faithfuls' the eight teams have
consistently taken the field each Saturday.
On occasions the enthusiastic support has
been somewhat embarrasing to Club offic-
ials: too many Club players have been
forced to play well below their standard,
with the result that the lower teams in
the Club had by far the most successful
first term. Messrs. Turner, Liberman and
Blakeley have endeavoured to strengthen
the fixture lists for these lower teams so
that much tougher and we hope more en-
joyable games will result for them.
Dave Hockin's Wanderers have had a
particularly brief but powerful life. Per-
haps their most worthy victory was a 3-0
win over a strong and experienced Old
Pauline's side. The three 'B' teams have
the best records in the Club, each having
only lost one game last term. Jim Carters
'Old Boys' for some 'un-natural' reason
narrowly lost the first game of the season
to Rosslyn Park side, after which they have
won handsomely eaoh week, the most
notable being a 33 pts. win over a Bord-
erer's team during the vacation. Chris
Head's team also fell victoriously to a
Rosslyn Park team and have likewise
triumphed ever since. John Lyndon's
team, the most 'sociably' minded of the
Chib gave of their best on Dec. 10th to
lower and trample on a King's team by
48 pts. to 0.
Of the four higher teams Dave Thomp-
son's Ex. A have a slight better reoprd
than Brian Manson's A team, while the
Ex. 1st have just about held their own.
NOTABLE EVENTS
The coming term is packed with notable
events which we would like to draw to
your attention, and hope you will support.
