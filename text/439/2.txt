letters to the editor Parkers PG
India Soc. reply
Dear Sir, — With reference to Mr
Ramendra G u h a ' s letter printed
on 3rd D e c ' 7 6 , I feel h i s
accusations about India Society
are completely b a s e l e s s . H e
has only managed to d i s p l a y
his ignorance.
He a c c u s e s the Society for
putting up posters, 'here and
there; but they are few and far
between'. H e doesn't know that
this is e x a c t l y what union rules
require us to do. Furthermore
this is a n establishment for
very intelligent people, so I
believe reading one poster with
sufficent information should
well suffice h i s requirements. I
cannot see why Mr Guha wants
to s e e , say, 16 similar posters
stuck o n a w a l l saying the
same thing. In a b i g place l i k e
I C no l e s s than 50 posters
were put up for India S o c ' s
film show and the freshers'
party.
F o r the same function,
individual letters were sent
out by our secratry to a l l the
members — Mr Guha i s one. If
121 other members received i t ,
I fail to s e e how Mr Guha w a s
m i s s e d on three o c c a s i o n s .
He a l s o says 'after all it
costs nothing' (to send put
individual letters to c l u b
members). T h i s is absolutely
r i d i c u l o u s . . We have spent about
£35.00 alone on publicity s o
far, most of it o n paper. In
addition a lot o f personal
effort goes- into making these
posters and addressing to A L L
M E M B E R S .
In my 8 years work with
various s o c i a l organisations,
I've come across many people
like Mr Guha who like to s i t
back a n d c r i t i c i z e . I have
appealed on various o c c a s i o n s
for a second publicity officer.
If Mr Guha feels he c a n do a
better j o b , I have one waiting
for h i m . I always welcome
enthuastic members who like
to see a better society. I c a n
be contacted v i a Mech E n g
letter rack or fn person at Room
806 Mech E n g (internal 3619).

Dear S i r , — In answer to Mr
Guha, ( F E L I X 3rd D e c ) and
for the interest of other P G s
reading the magazine, the I C
postgraduate group is at present
investigating the p o s s i b i l i t y of
obtaining a common-room for
P G s . T h e first step i s to find
out if such a room i s wanted by
the majority of P G s at I C . So
if anyone i s interested, could
they please contact either
myself (on Int 2263) or their own
departmental reps as soon a s
p o s s i b l e a n d make their v i e w s
known.
Yours faithfully

Dear S i r , — I appreciate that i n
certain circumstances it is not
within your privelege to funda-
mentally alter a r t i c l e s . However,
I feel that publishing two
paragraphs written b y different
members of the E x e c u t i v e , both
entitled ' N U S Referendum
(last w e e k ' s issue,) when they
are i n direct opposition is
perhaps indiscreet.
In point of fact it is interest-
ing that 2 sabbaticals obviously
do not consult each other before
putting pen to paper.
I. would be grateful if some-
one would inform me when I
w i l l be able to exercise my
democratic rights.
Yours s i n c e r e l y ,

Malicious attack
on Mary A
Dear Sir, — T h e motion which
was to be proposed by P Ide a t
the last U G M was a flagrant
attack on the right of a l l I C U
members to take an active part
in running their union.
I umamazed that the Union
E x e c u t i v e distributed copies of
this motion around the C o l l e g e ,
appalled that Mary Attenborough
was — the subject of the
motion — was not informed
beforehand that the motion had
been proposed.
The inclusion of this motion,
whether it is seen as a malicious
attack on o n e member of 1CU
or a s a sick joke, is clearly not
conducive to serious Union
debate.
It is not coincidential that
the motion attacked a woman
student of I C ; and the motion's
implication is clear: that
women are not expected to put
forward arguments a s clearly
and forcefully a s Mary Atten-
borough d o e s . ,
From this P Ida has drawn
the c o n c l u s i o n that women who
do stand up for their b e l i e f s ,
Chinese Society
Dear S i r , — I would like to
draw the attention of C h i n e s e
Society members to the recent
unexpected cancellation of
Cambridge trip previously
scheduled for I 1th D e c . It was
then claimed to be the conse-
quence of 'poor response' from
the members.
L e t ' s face the facts, there
were no posters, and only a
few line written down some-
where in the corner of the
previous society circular; that's
a l l . Though we were offered a
few names to c o n t a c t , these
people — who were supposed to
be responsible for s e l l i n g
tickets — d i d not even know
they had been picked for the
job.
I would a l s o like to remind
you that whilst other C h i n e s e
Societies in the University
were z e a l o u s l y preparing for
L U C S C S (London University
Chinese S o c i e t y Cultural
Section) versus Mancherster
University C U game (held on
U t h D e c in Mancherster) we
did nothing. Is it true that a s a
founder member of L U C S C S , we
have actually disaffiliated from
L U C S C S ? So far this year
nothing has been said about
L U C S C S .
With, no collaboration with,
L U C S C S i s Chinese Society
honestly doing enough for its
members under the favourite
conditions — such a s v a s t
support from members & sub-
stantial finance at I C . Surely
I am not the only one who feels
this w a y .
Happy Xmas.

must be in some way deficient
as women. Such attitudes
must change if the college is to
encourage more women to take
up courses at I C .
Yours sincerely,

padlings
I just realised that this
illustrious publication is coming
out on Thursday next week on
account of a l l these undergrads
flaking out and running off home
to mum's Christmas puddings.
So, if I am to wish anyone a
happy Christmas, it w i l l have to
be done very rapidly before I go
off to paddle at B l a c k p o o l .
Another N U S conference is
with u s , and with their overdraft
looking almost a s bad a s mine,
at £91,000, it should be a very
interesting one.
The P G Cheese and Wine
party came and went. Turn out
was a little disappointing at
around 60 people, but those that
did manage to resist the
temptation to go to 'Tommy' or
Smoking Concert seemed to
enjoy the evening. I must thank
Jamie for the good v i b e s , a n d
Pat a n d Andy for running t h e
bar. Suggestions for future
s o c i a l s would be greatly
appreciated. T w o departments
have already taken advantage
of our offers of financial a i d
to promote events at depart-
mental l e v e l . C o u n c i l , in i t s :
benign generosity, gave £120 to
to Mines Union to promote P G
a c t i v i t i e s — any offers to spend
it for them should be flung i n
the direction of the RSMU
office.
Fees protests
You w i l l a l l know by now
that fees for P G s are to rise
next year to £750 (£850 for
overseas P G s ) . T h e Friday
before last I helped to deliver
around 1,400 letters from this
college protesting against these
.proposals. They were laid in
Yhe hallway of Mrs Shirley
W i l l i a m s ' house at 8.00am on a
very cold morning. We were
later able to s e e Mrs Williams
over coffee and d i s c u s s o u r
grievances.She was sympathetic
but conceded very little. I'd
like to thank a l l those w h o
signed letters, and I hope y o u
w i l l a l l be prepared to put pen
to ink again next year. I would
particularly like to hear from
any P G s who anticipate real
difficulties when the new fees
are enforced.
The Pearson report on P G
Education in IC is s t n l on the
table tor d i s c u s s i o n : I hope that
!he P G Group w i l l be setting
p a small study group to look
ito it in the N e w Y e a r ,
departmental d i s c u s s i o n of the
report should a l s o be taking
place in a l l departments — make
sure that P G opinions are
expressed.
Wen i t ' s time to wander up
the Golden M i l e . My bucket and
spade are a l l ready but I must
remember to get a packet of
little flags to put on the sand
c a s t l e s . I'm taking a b i g spade
for the 'bury Charles C l a r k e '
competition. R j c k p a r k e r
