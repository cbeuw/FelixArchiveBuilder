Have a good (jnnstmas and a Happy
New Year. Take care and so long.
Nightline open
throughout Xmas
We hope that a l l overseas students
have heard about the possibility offered
by the British C o u n c i l to spend Christmas
with an E n g l i s h family. It is well worth
doing this a s there is little you can do
on your own in London around Christmas.
Christmas is something the E n g l i s h
people celebrate completely within the
family, so why not join i n .
The address of the British C o u n c i l
is: 11 Portland P l a c e , London W1,
telephone: 636 6888. A s k for the
British C o u n c i l Student Centre. Common-
wealth students can a l s o try the Victoria
League Students Centre, 54 L e i c e s t e r
Square, London W2, telephone: 229 3961,
(you had better hurry up if you want to
use the V i c t o r i a League.)
NIGHTLINE 581-2468
INTERNAL 2468
6pm - 9am Every Day
Someone to talk to...
...and information
If on the other hand you dd not feel
like spending Christmas With an E n g l i s h
family, or for some reason or another you
have not been able to reply, Nightline
will be staying open a l l Christmas. 11
enough people turn up during the Christ-
mas days we might even have a small
party with a Christmas tree, food and
drinks.
There is no need to tell anyone in
advance that you are coming and every-
body is welcome any day of the holiday
(or after) between 6pm and 9am. T h e
address i s : 10 Princes Gardens, SW7.
The telephone number i s : 581 2468. Y o u
can of course a l s o ring or come round for •
a more personal talk.
P l e a s e take care that you do not end
up al I alone over Christmas, and whatever
you do to celebrate Christmas we hope
you have a very happy one and a happy
New Year.
