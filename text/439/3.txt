F E L I X , D E C E M B E R 16th 1976 - 3
Congrats to R C S and commiserations to G u i l d s on the m a s c o t s
snatch on T u e s d a y . T h e idea of a treasure hunt for their return should
stimulate a lot of welcome interest in the C C U s next term. A t long
last though mascotry has been returned to i t s proper state after some
violet moments this term.
It's a pity that guilds should have to end on such a low note after
a super term, but they themselves acknowledge the ingenuity of the
mascot grab. T h e y , like me, admire Martin Watson for h i s courage in
carrying out the plan — almost singlehanded.
NUS Conference
From coverage in the national papers and our efforts on the back
page I hope you gather the N U S conference was i t s usual procrastinat-
ing bore. That conference should refuse Sir K e i t h Joseph permission
to attend seems s i l l y . N U S needs a s much support a s p o s s i b l e at
Westminster; F r i d a y ' s incidents, and the resulting press coverage,
w i l l do little to help. Again we have the situation of ideals before
realities
