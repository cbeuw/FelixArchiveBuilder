NEWSPAPER Of IMPCRlAl COLLEGE UNION
De drop in supplement
Y o u have seen pull-outs, fold-outs,
spread-outs, and rip-off sheets (5p). Now
here y o u have a drop-out supplement.
F E L I X h a s been readable for most o f
this term but s o empty a s to be u s e l e s s
for more than a few minutes of first
lecture. So under the direction of de
P r e s ' here i s a demonstration (?) of how
to produce a student newsheet.
T h i s move must, a s C l i v e b e l i e v e s ,
be the right step. After the A l t e r n a t i v e
P r o s p e c t u s what better than a n alternative
F E L I X ? We do not aim to confine news
and interesting material to one page per
week but with a l l the other drivel a n d
very little news what do you expect. L e t
us hope that next term this need not be a
viable proposition.

B y the time this reaches you it may
have been c u t , edited, c a l l it what y o u
w i l l . T h i s w i l l of course have been done
in such a way that it does not alter t h e
sense of any a r t i c l e , it merely removes
it altogether. The n e c e s s i t y for this w a s
ensured by sweeping absurdities cover-
ing the staff of F E L I X , IC U n i o n , a n d
F E L I X Editor, but then what e l s e i s this
paper for I a s k myself (well you weren't
going to a s k me were you? N o ! quite).
Laughter i s the best medicine, e s p e c i a l l y
if it i s at someone e l s e , s o why not put
it i n print and cheer up the whole college
(except for a minority who don't know
how to laugh, can't read, or find them-
s e l v e s mentioned somewhere i n t h i s
drivel). Perhaps the editor ought to s l i p
along to N o . 10 and give J i m a hand to
make a nonsense of l e s s sporting
a c t i v i t i e s .
B a s i c a l l y we published a l l the articles
we received by the copy date plus a
minute or two. ( T o . t e l l the truth we
wrote it a l l and committed the rest to
the waste-paper basket). Unfortunately
the I F Only column was censored (we
think!) It was last seen in thv hands of
T P ' s minions with mutterings of hand
grenade earings and perforated midrifts
(303 s i z e ) emmanating from their office.
A p o l o g i e s to Anne-Marie for not pub-
l i s h i n g it, maybe after our courtmarshal
(or Commemoration D a y 1977) we w i l l
manage it.
A s y o u c a n s e e with such important
articles a s editorials, space gets a b i t
cramped and so we must sign off now.

E r urn . . . I think I'll come back on this one
next week . . .
Now let me think.

T h i s new scheme, run by the N U S
new scneme, run
E x e c u t i v e , has the objective of discounting
rumours concerning the aforementioned
E x e c u t i v e . T h e E x e c u t i v e hope that these
rumours c a n be discounted to such an
extent a s to render them worthless. H o w -
ever the s u c c e s s of this venture must be
open to doubt; perhaps the results of t h e
scheme w i l l be seen at the NUS conference
this week.
British Rail Discount Cards
These cards which are now only a v a i l a b l e
from British R a i l , certify the holder to be a
B r i t i s h R a i l Student. T h e benefits of this
are uncertain except that British R a i l
Students are treated like children on t h e
trains and given half price fares. I suppose
it's one way to take years off your life.
Vacancies
There are currently two seats a v a i l a b l e
in the committee room opposite the ICWA
lounge in the Union B u i l d i n g . T h i s has
come about due to the previous occupants
of the seats having finished their business
in the committee room. They have now
graciously vacated these seats so that others
may use the f a c i l i t i e s a v a i l a b l e . A n y o n e
wishing to a v a i l themselves of these
f a c i l i t i e s should come and see me very soon
before their situation gets too desperate.
Parking
It has been brought to my notice that a
number of cars are being parked in C o l l e g e
without Parking Permits. T h e Motor C l u b
has kindly suggested dismantling them for
spares but I feel it would solve the problem
quicker by setting fire to them. Friday
lunchtimes has provisionally been set aside
for burning c a r s .

A demonstration by the duplicating
machines w i l l be held -next Monday in the
Beit Quad. The machines are protesting
against the proposed paper c u t s , the poor
quality of the finished articles and overwork.
The demonstration involves about twenty
machines and is likely to bring chaos to the
Quad and restrict a c c e s s to the Refectory
and Bar areas.
Take care and a l l the best,
ORANGE
MOLE
Over the last two years, if not for a much
longer period, IC Union has been looking
very c r i t i c a l l y at itself. Having studied
ourselves very carefully w e are now looking
for some one e l s e to examine equally
c l o s e l y .
Noticeboards
P l e a s e respect the Union notice boards,
both old and new. A n y contravening of the
P u b l i c i t y R u l e s w i l l result in the offending
C l u b / S o c i e t y being immediately disbanded
plus a fine of £50 per poster. Individuals
breaking the rules w i l l have their hands
severed. Just to clear up any misunderstand-
ing, I w i l l outline these rules below:
1. N o poster may be put up within 20ft of
any other poster.
2. Posters may only be attached to official
notice boards. D o not put up your own
notice boards across doors or windows.
3. Posters may be stuck on w a l l s if you
use 4V2" No. 8 wood screws or chewing gum.
Araldite may only be used for Ents posters.
4 . If you stick posters on the window panes,
please use drawing pins only.
5. Individual posters must not exceed 150
square feet in area.
