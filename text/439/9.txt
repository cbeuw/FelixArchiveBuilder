IC Dramsoc: " T h e F l i e s " by Jean-Paul
Sartre (directed by Sallyann Kronbergs).
The c h o i c e of this play for Dramsoc to
perform is suspect, for 'The Flies' i s
nothing less than a v e h i c l e for the author's
existentialist theories which tend to throw
argument and reason to the four winds i n
favour of total committment to personally
contrived e t h i c s . Presenting one's o w n
ideas through the medium of a play i s , of
course, perfectly legitimate, but where a s
at an open debate on the subject one c a n
heckle and oppose to one's heart's content,
a play requires poiite s i l e n c e to be observed.
The facile plot is that young O r e s t e s
has returned home after a fifteen year
absenoe; defying religion and morality
— a s represented by Z e u s , — he proceeds
to a s s a s s i n a t e the usurping monarch ( h i s
father's murder) and his consorting mother;
all without feeling a trace of remorse.
Incredible? Just a b i t . Written in 1943
when France was overrun by Germany, i t
fashionably embodied the partisan spirit
of French resistance and it was inevitably
suppressed by the occupying forces.
Only a glimmer of extentialism
H i s t o r i c a l l y inaccurate, the play i s
strategically made uncomplicated so that the
e x i s t e n t i a l i s m of Orestes, a straightforward
ethics r e v i s i o n i s t , c a n shine brightly
through. I only saw a glimmer of it.
A s Orestes, Andy Middleton had a
difficult and demanding task. A l l credit to
him for managing so w e l l . H i s voice carried,
but physically he appeared too stiff and too
s t a t i c . In the scene where he has just
k i l l e d Aegisthens and a s k s E l e c t r a where
his mother's room is — s o that he can k i l l
her as well — he sounded like someone out
for a drink, asking where the next pub w a s .
A s Orestes' tutor, Manu Duggal seemed
again unconvincing a s our anti-hero's
aging mentor. E r i c S t o v e l l , as Z e u s , gave
Dramsoc has talent &
direction - all it needs
is the right play
a forceful interpretation of the p l a y ' s chief
moralist who ends up outwitted by cleverly
presented e x i s t e n t i a l i s t t a c t i c s . T h i s man's
talent is beyond doubt: h i s lines delivered
in various bold cadences emphasised h i s
part a s king of the gods and echoed h i s
masterful presence on stage.

E l e c t r a , Orestes sister, was played by
IF newcomer J u l i a N e a l e . S h e w a s a
pleasure to watch and brought some badly
needed life to the play. Her costume in A c t
I was highly becoming (not to mention her
costume i n A c t s II and III!), s o much s o
that at one point I almost want to climb in
there with her. Her varied delivery, e x p r e s -
sions and reactions make her a must f o r
future productions.
A s Clytemnestra, Sarah James seemed
a little strained at times. During her first
meeting with Orestes, whom s h e d i d n o t
recognise a s her s o n , the irony of her
questions about his mother w a s not s e i z e d
at a l l . A n d when mother and daughter
(Clytemnestra and> Electra) argued in A c t I,
I felt no tension, no anxiety. T h i s was n o
generation-gap acrimony; it was almost a
polite bunfight.
Superb vignettes
Peter E d had a very commanding presence
a s the usurper King A e g i s t h e u s . On the
whole an excellent performance from him
apart from one or two fluffs of lines. H e
" d i e d " extremely competently. Special
mention must be made of Robert B u c k , who
at first played an idiot and later played 2nd
soldier. Frankly I think his characterisations
were absolutely superb vignettes. H is
stance and animation brought vigour and
vitality to a n often grey continuum of
monotone.
The scenery was generally of a very high
standard. I felt that the stage in A c t I would
have benefitted from some steps and / o r
a bench because in a l l only two characters
actually s a t down during the whole p l a y .
The columns on the mountain terrace looked
superb — <a pity that they swayed when
people ascended the steps between them.
The costumes were, a s u s u a l , first c l a s s .
(I'm tempted to say more about E l e c t r a ' s ,
but I'd only be branded a lecher.)
No lazy mannerisms
Once again then, the c h o i c e of play
must come under fire a n d , inevitably, i t s
director, Sallyann Kronbergs. It stands a s
testimony to the direction that not o n e
player folded his arms, put his hands on his
h i p s , put a palm to h i s head but instead
largely stood upright with his arms dangling
like u s e l e s s , face id appendages. The pity
of it a l l i s ' t h a t with the likes of s t o v e l l ,
N e a l e , E d ; Buck and others, the raw
talent js there. It just needs the right play.

(Friday 10th December)
The task of the critic is a l w a y s two-fold.
F i r s t l y he has a duty to inform his readers;
this must always be h i s prime function
s i n c e he is an employee of the newspaper
and not of the performers. Secondly^ if the
performers are amongst h i s readers, then
he may try to give them helpful c r i t i c i s m .
The events that a critic is asked to report
on a l s o fall into two categories: those
which occur only once, and those which
are repeated and which, of c o u r s e , the
readers w i l l have a chance to s e e . In the
latter c a s e the critic should fashion h i s
review in such a way that the reader may
make an informed d e c i s i o n .
Last F r i d a y ' s concert i s a particularly
tricky c a s e s i n c e I am not in a position to
advise readers to go to the concert; neither
a n I well-enough qualified to provide any
constructive criticism of the performance.
By its very nature the Choir .absorbs a l l
the musical talent in the C o l l e g e , leaving a
humble admirer who j.ust likes to hear a
good sound. T o those of you who feel like
turning to the cross-country report at this
point may I advise you to go to the next
concert on 18th March and hear the C h o i r
yourself. They are excellently trained by
E r i c Brown and make a splendid n o i s e . The
Special Orchestra and Soloists are a l s o ' a
great pleasure to listen to.
The concert opened, not with the choir,
orchestra or s o l o i s t s , but with a number of
pistol shots to test the a c o u s t i c s of t h e
Emotional Kodaly livens up
Choir's acoustic battle
h a l l , with the audience a s guinea pigs
providing the necessary a c o u s t i c a l surface
for the experiment. No doubt something w i l l
now begin to be done about the a p p a l l i n g
a c o u s t i c s of the Great H a l l , which makes
you feel a s though you need to have your
ears syringed.
Battling against the hall the choir had
chosen a pretty doll selection of p i e c e s .
Some years ago an Icon c r i t i c made t h e
choir perform some livelier music. L a s t
year they d i d s o but thrs year's programme
seems to have taken them back to the old
d a y s . That is not to say that dull music is
bad per s e , merely that too much dull music
is a bad thing.
The programme began with a particularly
unmemorable piece from Haydn's The Sea-
sons, appropriately Winter, which left m e
yearning for a rousing spring. The highlight
of the evening w a s K o d a l y ' s Psalmus
Hungaricus with a fine tenor s o l o i s t in
A l a n Woodrow. The setting is of P s a l m 55,
which provides admirable material, from.the
p s a l m i s t ' s despair under his oppression t o
the joy in the thought of G o d ' s power to
save h i m . A l l the emotions were w e l l put
over by the choir.
The second half contained what I suppose
would have been described a s R o s s i n i ' s
answer to the Verdi Requiem had it not been
written first. T h e work i s the Stabat Mater,
a very operatic setting of a religious work.
A s an Opera the action might have brighten-
ed things u p , however there were a few
thrills in the work, particularly in the
c l o s i n g fugue, which unfortunately c o n -
tained an uncontrolled s i b i l l a n t .
