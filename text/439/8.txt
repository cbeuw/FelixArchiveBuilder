Bank takes the lead!
if only
'Rumours of a student starv-
ing to death in the Nat West
Bank queue appear to be true.
A t first it was strongly denied,
but when a body was found some
two hours after c l o s i n g time
people began c a l l i n g for an
immediate enquiry.
In connection with this,
refectory queues seem to be
getting out of hand. Mr Mooney's
refectories, which used to hold
the record for the longest time
wasters, are BOW falling behind
the aforesaid Bank, which has
recently be enlarged to accom-
modate longer queues.
In the refectory c l a s s , the
Union R e f e c is currently the
winner with peak time crocodiles
just managing a second lap of
the Union foyer as well as
three sides of the refectory.
Running a c l o s e second,
but unfortunately f a l l i n g behind
each day, is C o l l e g e B l o c k
R e f e c . Here a double queue of
80yards is quite u s u a l .
A neck and neck battle
between the Buttery's hot and
c o l d queues is proving most
interesting, e s p e c i a l l y when
minority factions are holding
book stalls in the way. Bringing
up the rear is South Side, with
an amazingly short wait for an
equally amazing portion of an
even more amazing substance.
T h i s week's tip for the
punters is surely the E n t s F i l m
queue which recently s h o c k e d
a l l observers by stretching
from Mech E n g 220 along the
Mech E n g foyer, past the lefts,
faltering slightly past a naughty
poster on the noticeboard, after
which it cut a c l o s e line past
the messengers desk to the
steps. Here, hardly pausing at
the i n c l i n e , it sped round the
c l o c k and out of the rear doors
of Mech E n g to an end some
95 yards along the walkway.
With a sustained effort, this
could prove to be the year's
winner.
