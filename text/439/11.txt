Tenpin Bowling L a d i e s Boat Club
Inconsistent quality
dampens early
anihilation
Novices make up for 'A'
team's ill luck
L a s t Saturday amidst com-
ments about dinosaurs and
spanners, Imperial C and Brunei
U took to the bowling lanes to
thrash out any differences at
the Airport B o w l , home ground
to both teams.
After 20 minutes of bowling
Brunei looked as if they were
to be annihilated by Imperial.
E a c h team won their first
game; but only the l s t carried
on at this standard, finishing
155 pins a h e a d . Danny L a u ,
our newest star, bowled 595
including a 232 in one game;
truly outstanding play.
The 2nds and 3rds whilst
took their first game but did not
maintain their q u a l i t y in the
rest of the match. T h i s , together
with the lack of l a d i e s , cost
Imperial the match. The result
2—8 could e a s i l y have b e e n
reversed. L o u s i a C h a n , the
only lady, bowled very w e l l for
the 3rds with a 388 s e r i e s , since
we were unable to field a
L a d i e s T e a m .
In repetition to last year it
seems that a lack of ladies and
inconsistent bowling by the
jnen has cost the club many
points this term. With only one
league match left to bowl
(against Brunei again), a good
turnout and a determined effort
to win may lead us to a much
better result.

I A N A L V E Y
One c o l d and frosty morning
(last Saturday 11th Dec) I C
ladies B o a t C l u b arrived en
masse at U L Boathouse in
C h i s w i c k . After waiting Yi hour
for our opponents the U L
Winter I V ' s began. F i r s t to
race were our novice ' A ' team
who won their heat by 2
lengths to get through to their
semifinal. Our c o l l e g e ' B ' crew
were next to boat but unfor-
tunately went out to Q u e e n Mary
C o l l e g e .
After a q u i c k changeover of
boats the C o l l e g e ' A ' crew
just lost to U n i v e r s i t y C o l l e g e ' s
who were then d i s q u a l i f i e d as
they weren't a l l n o v i c e ! So,
both our novice crews were
through to the s e m i f i n a l s , and
the college ' A ' crew to the
f i n a l s . Our novice ' A ' crew
beat Barts II e a s i l y , and the
novice ' B ' crew narrowly lost
to Q M C .
After a break for lunch, during
which we tried to hide our nerves
the n o v i c e s rowed first and
took the lead from the start to
beat Q M C by 3 lengths. Unfortu-
nately the c o l l e g e final did not
go so w e l l with the c o l l e g e ' A '
crew beating Q M C but lagging
behind U C by 2 lengths at the
f i n i s h . It is perhaps a pity that
able c o x i n g by N i g e l Williams
and Gary N o l a n did not achieve
better r e s u l t s .
