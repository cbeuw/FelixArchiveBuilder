NUS conference report by Paul Ekpenyong
ENDSLEIGH SOLD
'The doom merchants were wrong, we'll be here in 1977',
stated C h r i s Morgan, N U S Treasurer i n summing-up on the N U S
Services debate. Mr Morgan, who suffered two motions of censure,
was able to make this c l a i m following the' passage of an amend-
ment to the main resolution c a l l i n g for the s a l e o f E n d s l e i g h
Insurance (Brokers) L t d .
E n d s l e i g h Insurance w a s a
depreciating burden w h i c h , a s
with the service companies that
had folded, was severely under
c a p i t a l i s e d , the conference was
told. A n injection of capital
into E n d s l e i g h o f the eider of
£300,000 w a s required i f the
insurance service for students
and the jobs of E n d s l e i g h staff
were to be safeguarded.'
Investigating Committee
The main resolution incor-
porating a n amendment c a l l i n g
for a committee to investigate
the c o l l a p s e of the travel a n d
printing companies was p a s s e d
with only a handful of votes
against. T h e election of members
of this committee took place o n
the last morning of the confer-
ence and the results are t o be
circulated t o constituent
organisations of N U S at a later
date. E i g h t candidates stood for
the five v a c a n c i e s o n the
committee and of these Andrew
Pott a n d S B a y l i s are almost
certain to be e l e c t e d .
LST.Bs
The final resolution p a s s e d
a l s o instructs the N U S E x e c .
'to assist in the setting up of
viable local student travel
bureux (LSTBs)' by l o c a l
student unions a n d l o c a l
student area organisations.
Nationalise
Two major amendments to
the main resolution, the first
sponsored by T r o t s k y i s t s groups
and the second by the Federation,
of Conservative Students ( F C S )
were heavily defeated Both
c a l l e d for the n o confidencing
of a l l the present N U S E x e c u t i v e
members of the Services B o a r d .
The Trotskyists amendment
also c a l l e d for the n a t i o n a l i s a -
tion o f the service companies.
Speaking against the amen-
dment, a delegate from Bolton
C o l l e g e o f Education described
it a s 'utopian rhetoric' a n d
condemned nationalisation a s
'anti-services which cater for
the diverse interests of all
students'.
Prior to the debate of the
motion on N U S Services, the
conference h a d considered and
rejected an emergency report on
NUS Services. T h e E x e c u t i v e
was severely c r i t i c i s e d and
angry delegates demanded to
know why no information had
been given to the membership
during the c r i t i c a l period before
it w a s decided to liq uidate
NUS T r a v e l , Uniprint a n d
Photomec.
Censure
R e p l y i n g , C h a r l e s C l a r k e
admitted that members (of NUS*)
felt they were kept in ignorance
of events but it was very
difficult to get across complex
financial information to the
membership. It h a d been
necessary to liquidate the
a i l i n g c o m p a n i e s without
notifying the m e m b e r s h i p
because a s soon a s it i s
realised that a company could
no longer trade it had to c e a s e
trading immediately, he s a i d .
Although, d i s s a t i f i e d dele-
gates failed to carry a motion
of no confidence, i n Mr C l a r k e ,
Chris Morgan, Dave Aaronovitch
( V P Services) dnd Ms Penny
Cooper ( V P Education) - the
executive members on the N U S
Services Board — they did pass
a motion of censure o n a l l four
by a substantial majority.
PARKER'S PRIORITISATION
MOVES FAIL
A move by the Federation of
'Conservative Students to have
elements of the grants campaign
prioritised failed by a majority
of 2 to 1 on a card vote. T h e
move was supported unanimously
by the I C delegation.
The move-embodied in a n
amendment to the main resolu-
tion — was attacked a s d i v i s i v e
and seeking to hide acceptance
of cuts i n public expenditure,by
Sue Slipman, N U S National
Secretary.
Speaking i n favour of the
amendment, Gary Grant (Birm-
ingham University) claimed that
there w a s " n o coherent
p o l i t i c a l a r g u m e n t against
p r i o r i t i s a t i o n " . A s a n example
of .the ineffectiveness of the
present broadly based campaign,
intercollating students were in
dire need and if the N U S d i d
not pull i t s finger out there
would be no intercollating
students, he c l a i m e d .
R i c k Parker, I C Union P G
Affairs Officer, summing u p ,
a c c u s e d the NUS E x e c u t i v e of
'absolute compromised paranoia'.
The broad front campaign he
s a i d , "is getting bloody thin".
A Trotskyist amendment
advocating 'supermilitancy' was
thrown out. The final resolution
adopted continues previous
policy on grants a n d cuts a n d
endorses the N U S c l a i m for a
35% increase in the main rate
of grant for 1977/78. T h e c l a i m
is £915 for students staying at
home, £1,185 as the main rate
and £1,290 for students i n
London. T h e corresponding
claims for postgraduates a r e
£1,525, £1,975 and £2,150.

Crisis avoided
'Unco-operaiive
However, it became apparent
at the meeting that the major
cause of the c r i s i s w a s the
resignation of staff due to
disagreements with editorial
p o l i c y . Mr Dewey h a d b e e n
'uncooperative with staff
on o c c a s i o n s to an extent con-
sidered far exceeding the
bounds of his office a s editor.
Mr Suss h a d attempted to
reason with Mr Dewey several
times and feeling he w a s
getting no-where, drew up the
petition a s a last resort. Mr
Ekpenyong c l a i m e d that
'discontent went as far as
the administration in College
Block'.
D a v i d F o x a l l (Phoenix editor)
an independent observer a t the
meeting blamed both s i d e s .
'There has been a lot of mis-
understanding and bad faith'
he said, 'Both sides have
become very polarised over the
matter.'
N i c k Brayshaw ( I C U P r e -
sident/ who just arrived at this
point, thought the measures
taken by Mr Suss were 'a bit
extreme'. H e suggested i i a t
rather than dragging up history,
the persons involved i n the
dispute get together to formulate
a list of points concerning
definite grievances to be
brought to a U G M . H e proposed
that a censure motion would
be more in order after both
sides have attempted to settle
their differences.
John White ( I C U Sec) pointed
out that there w i l l be a U G M
in the first week of term to
d i s c u s s travel a n d the F E L I X
Question could be raised a t
that meeting. A s he h a d not
yet received the petition, he
had not enough time to c a l l a
U G M for the next day.
Mr Suss then said that h e
would be prepared to move
censure rather than no-confid-
,ence if Mr Dewey would only
consent to a change i n attitude.
T h i s w a s agreed t o , a n d a n
adjourment w a s c a l l e d for
while the parties d i s c u s s e d in
private the nature of the motion
to the U G M .
T h e motion w i l l take die
f o l l o w i n g form:-
1. A n agreement on what went
wrong i n F E L I X .
2 . D i s c u s s i o n of position of
F E L I X within the Union.
3. A c a l l for a n independant
F i n a n c i a l Controller without
whose consent no money c a n
be spent.
4. A request that a l l parties
show a change of attitude and
have more good w i l l .
5. T o move a motion of censure
on Mr Dewey.
It was also agreed that the i
E x e c u t i v e be mandated to
appoint an interim F i n a n c i a l
Controller.
The Editor w i s h e s it to be
known that Mr Crabbe has been
given a completely free hand to
write this story.
At an emergency meeting of the I C U P u b l i c a t i o n s Board, held
on Monday evening the circumstances leading to the recent petition
for an E G M were considered. After some considerable d i s c u s s i o n
it was agreed by a l l parties that the proposed motion of. no
confidence i n Mr Dewey was not justified but that there was a real
problem within F E L I X . T h e meeting agreed that the financial
position w a s serious and that a financial controller should b e
appointed by the Union E x e c u t i v e immediately. No money i s to be
spent without the consent of the controller. A l l parties agreed to a
substantial shift i n attitude and to pnt the paper first before
personal disagreements. A motion on these points i s to be pre-
sented at the next U G M along with a motion of censure o n Mr
Dewey for a l l o w i n g the situation to develop.
Any party who has any views on t h e future of F E L I X and i t s
role i n I C U should contact the Pub. Board Working P a r t y , v i a
myself in the Union O f f i c e , who are currently considering F E L I X .
The next meeting i s at the beginning of next term.
