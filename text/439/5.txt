Poor brewery supplies force Bar to switch to reliable ale source
Watneys take over Union Bar
South face climb
reduced to closing
-time stroll
Earlier this week, news
reached us that a strong team
of Imperial climbers have finally
overcome one of the last of the
great problems of the locality.
L a t e last Tuesday evening, a
small dedicated band of
mountaineers reduced this
difficult route (the traverse of
of the South Face of Beit
B u i l d i n g , eastwards from the
Union Arch) to a mere c l o s i n g -
time stroll.
One of their more prominent
members has kindly provided the
following details of the exped-
ition:
"The climb began by scaling
the wrought iron gate and trans-
ferring to the masonary of the
archway, from where we dropped
down to the narrow sill outside
the 'Guard Box'. Moving
cautious ly to our right we
stepped across to the Varitype
Ledge.
"The next stage was a
careful shuffle along the Printing
Room sill to the difficult Rose
Window, which has proved a
thorn in the side of previous
attempts. However, high spirits
within the team carried us
easily across to the smallest
ledge of the traverse, after
which comes the previously
'Impossible Corner'.
"This was turned after a
few close shaves when members
of the ' expedition lost their
footing. Using a hitherto untried
technique, our leader finally
gained the'relative safety of the
of the next eastward ledge.
"The team followed his
example and the final stage
past the Botany Entrance proved
a mere formality."
Our staff expert on climbing
matters, Ms V i r g i n i a Creeper,
has raised grave doubts as to
the new method used to crack
the " I m p o s s i b l e C o r n e r " . She
suspects i l l i c i t use of a bar
stool.
Rumours have been circulating college during the past
week that, following a visit by the Watney's representative,
a different brewery will be supplying the Union Bar in the
New Year. At present it has not been possible to track down
either confirmation or a firm denial but certainlythere has
been a strong reaction from some members of the Union
closely involved with bar activities.
Stop Press
SAMBotage
Recently, in a stunningly
swift attack, our P o l i t i c a l
correspondant w a s seriously
wounded in a most sensitive
area. After recent exposure in
the popular p r e s s , the king of the
L S O had suffered continual
harrassment and had decided to
fade from the public eye.
However this t e r r o r i s t
action i s bound to produce-
some countermeasures from h i s
close a s s o c i a t e s while he is
incapacitated.
Security F o r c e s do have one
lead in this very strange affair
and have issued the following
warning. A v o i d a l l s u s p i c i o u s
persons wearing blonde wigs
and showing a good set of
teeth. When confronted you are
advised to remain seated and
not be confused by the pidgin.
Stunned reactions
Any move to change to a
different brewery would come a s
no surprise to those people
conversant with recent failures
on the part of the present
suppliers. During the past few
weeks the draught lemonade tap
has been removed after S c h -
weppes proved inefficient in
s u p p l y i n g s u f f i c i e n t
stocks to keep pace with s a l e s .
They are not alone in failing to
meet promised delivery dates,
Scottish and N e w c a s t l e Brewer-
ies have also consistently failed
to produce the goods on time.
Having heard the rumour that
Watney-Mann were being c a l l e d
upon to supply u s , our corres-
pondent went out to gauge
reaction. N o one would confirm
or deny the rumours but many
w e l l known regulars were quite
vocal about the matter. P a u l
K u r o w s k i , C h r i s Morrell and
Adrian Sudworth could manage
little more than a stunned,
"What!", whilst Steve Dearing
of C i t y and G u i l d s was somewhat
more forthcoming: "It's ******
what!" N i c k Brayshaw w a s
not available to comment but
Mr John White seemed uncon-
cerned, pausing only to comment
that "It doesn't make any
difference to me". The official(?)
I C U line appears to come from
Derrick Everett (Bar Committee
Chairman), who would only s a y
that the choice of beers "is up
to Brendan (Bar Manager)" and
he thought the changes were
"a malicious rumour".
Guinness unaffected
Further investigations, i n -
cluding staff interviews, served
only to clarify the rumours. It
would appear the Watney's are
being a s k e d to supply real a l e
(going under the trade name of
" F i n e d A l e " ) , but that supplies
of present extras, such a s cider
and Guinness (draught and
oottled), should remain u n -
affected.
The bar manager, Mr Brendan
Clements, a confirmed G u i n n e s s
drinker, appeared unperturbed by
the whole affair. "Til work for
any one who pays me" he s a i d
in answer to our reporter's
questions. Perhaps Mr Clements
is unaware of the detrimental
effect on trade that this change
could have. Many people have
expressed support for the idea
of a boycott of the bar if these
measures come into force and
'Squaddie' Patterson, H o n S e c
of R S M U , w a s certainly not
alone when he s a i d , " / ' / / go
and drink elsewhere."
Nothing but h
a
r
m
So it would seem that the
general consensus of opinion
amongst students i s that the
proposed change to Watneys w i l l
do nothing but harm to the
c o n v i v i a l i t y of the Union B a r .
"No beer is better than
Watneys!" could w e l l be a
battle cry heard in the near
future. Perhaps college ought
to rethink the whole matter i n
view of the fact that the Union
B a r supports the refectories to
a great extent and an organised
boycott of the bar could have
serious consequences to the
financial stability of this side
of college affairs.
