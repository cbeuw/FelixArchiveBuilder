PROFILEâ€” IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Profiles a drawlns silhouette or other rep-
resentation of a side view. How can one draw a
silhouette or "other representation" of an i n s t i -
tution which has no outline exeept in the archi-
tectural sense, and a personality so complex and
intangible that even such die-hard students as. Mr.
Scott-Fleming (1936 and s t i l l going strong) would
find i t difficult to analyse. In search of insp-
iration, we consulted the Oxford Dictionary and
found amonst other meanings "a shallow vat in
which beer is left to clear"; Interesting, but
seldom applicable to our Union.
The Freshman for his f i r s t few weeks has the
physical layout and component clubs of the Union
quickly drummed into him. He soon discovers that
the main building housing the bar is usually cal-
led the Union, that the new building opposite i s
called the Belt building and includes the New Hos-
t e l , New Lounge, Bookstall and Administrative of-
fices, and that the Old Hostel is tucked away in a
corner and seems Impossibly small to house about
50 raving maniacs. On his f i r s t day, i t i s ener-
getically brought to his notice that the Union
Athletic clubs include almost every form of stu-
dent sport (the remaining forms being facilitated
by the social clubs) and that the Union sports
ground is near the Red Lion at Harlington. Thsy
learn that the organisation of the Union as a
whole is run by a student Council, that Mr. Coom-
ber (R.C.S.) is President and Mr. Nicholas (R.C.S)
the Secretary; that 'Me Union office is next to
the Bookstall; and that the affairs of Council
are second favourite to the Refectory Committee
when the Editor of Felix is feeling v i t r i o l i c .
Thus, the outline of the Union i s quite
quickly and easily distinguished. What of the
finer lines and shading that give the outline
character? These can only be f i l l e d in by time.
At one moment the Union i s quiet, comfortable and
almost a normal gentlemen's club - with a few
ladies tolerated (except in the bar) for their
charm and their c i v i l i z i n g influence on the wil-
der elements; at the next i t will be transformed
into a den of howling dervishes Intent on dives-
ting some unfortunate of his trousers. On Satur-
day nights i t becomes a sort of nightmare palais
de danse, with girls from far and wide in their
best dresses and the College in i t s usual old
corduroys and blazer, too many people dancing and
too many in the bar drinking too much beer* -
in fact everyone thoroughly enjoying themselves.
Throughout the year there is a succession of din-
ners and dances, ranging from white ties and pre-
pared speeches to the mat-throwing chaos of cer-
tain club dinners. Carnival nights have to be
seen to be believed - they defy sober description.
Thus the picture i s slowly f i l l e d in. The
Union forms the student l i f e , and the students'
lives form the Union, Its history has never been
written, but is hidden in ancient archives and
peoples' memories. It almost atrophied during
the war, and i t s rapid recovery since then has
been due to a succession of energetic Presidents
and a Rector who has the welfare of the College
very much at heart. Plans are now afoot for ex-
tensions and modifications to the buildings, and
i f the recent increase in interest in Union acti-
vities continues It should ensure that, although
we are a technical college, we can yet enjoy a
f u l l l i f e .
