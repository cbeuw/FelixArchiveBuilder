F E L I X
DUCKS IN DEVON
(or How We Bowled a Maiden Over).
Sixteen members of the cricket club went on,
the- traditional end-of-term tour of South Devon.
All the matches were played, - and there was one
every day, whleh w i l l surprise those who assert
that the cricket is but the ostensible reason for
this annual caravanserai.
The evening of our arrival In Torquay was oc-
cupied by keen discussion of the finer points of
the came (and etc.) at the "Hole in the Wall" and
the Devon Arms". But in spite of this the opening
match, against Paignton, ended in a disappointing
defeat by four wickets. The captain and captain-
elect (Pete Davies and John Rambaut) conferred over
this perturbing result late into the evening. Next
day John was s t i l l too upset to play against Tor-
quay, while Pete felt compelled to delegate his
duties to the vice-captain and f i e l d during the af-
ternoon in the shadow of a friendly tree. Torquay
declared at 168-8 and I.C., betrayed by their own
umpire, were 123-9 at the close. Pete emerged from
the shadow to score 57, and the inimitable Rowland
Reynolds played out time by scoring 8 off the last
over, thus doubling his season's total.
Another more favourable draw followed against
Srixham, and the team then moved to Exeter where
University College of the South West, after two
years of restoration and rebuilding, again provided
us with rooms. From these a descent was made upon
Whimple and Whlteway's G.C. whose orchard-flanked
ground boasts a large tree (two runs i f you hit i t )
close to the wicket. A collapse from 37-1 to 72
a l l out augured i l l , but the consumption at tea of
a very great quantity of gooseberry tart restored
some long-departed fire to Peter Justesen's bowl-
ing. On a helpful pitch, he took 6 wickets for 4
runs in 26 balls and the game was worn by 21 runs,
ihe evening passed in an Inspection of the products
of local industry.
At Tavistock on the next afternoon, "Useless"
was again in lively mood, and succeeded in felling
the opposing skipper with a sharply r i s i n g b a l l .
Tavistock's total of 107 proved however a winning
one. Their hill-top ground, bounded by a circle of
standing stones, has a vague air of prehistory;
and I.C., batting as i f under some druidic spell,
could muster only 71.
The last game at Exeter was against University
College. Sent into bat on a wet wicket, I.C.
scored 84 (Rambaut, restored in spirits, making 34)
and won by 21 runs. Useless took another 4 wickets
and Reynolds 3.
Then to Plymouth and Malcolm's restaurant,
where the enormous mixed g r i l l s , especially i f con-
sumed with the local form of apple-juice, are well
designed to revive flagging energy. Both matches
here were played on the excellent ground at Mount
Wise. In the f i r s t , against the United Services,
Pete Davies scored 102 in less than ninety minutes
and the I.C. total reached 194. B r i l l i a n t batting
by Commander Thackara (114 not out) rapidly brought
the United Services back into the picture, and they
eventually reached 198-2. The I.C. bowlers, led by
the undaunted Reynolds, never gave up, not even
when the boundary fieldsmen took to stopping each
other instead of the b a l l .
The Royal Marines began the f i n a l game by dis-
missing two I.C. batsmen practically instantaneous-
ly. Unjustified expectations were thus aroused
among local supporters, who could not know that
"Useless" and Reynolds had been eccentrically pro-
moted in the batting order. Derek Wyles and Chris.
Wilson added 123 for the next wicket, and the i n -
nings was declared closed at 156-4. The Marines,
checked by accurate bowling, had reached 138-6 at
the close of play.
Further gluttonous activity at Malcolm's oc-
cupied much of the last evening and was found to
reduce greatly the capacity to absorb liquid re-
freshment. Davies, in particular, was only equal
to a pint and a half (No cracks by request).
A l l who went on i t w i l l agree that the tour
was a highly enjoyable cricketing holiday, for
which much thanks to the hospitable Devon cricket
clubs who were our hosts during - and after - the
matches.
HENLEY - 1950
From Our Rowing Correspondent.
Henley - What a v i s t a the word conjures up to
the rowing man. That l o v e l y course w i t h the t r i -
a n g u l a r f i e l d below the woods on the h i l l s behind
the s t a r t . White f l a n n e l s and .blazers; coaches on
ramshackle b i c y c l e s ; the boat t e n t s ; "Strawberry-
nose"; p r e t t y g i r l s i n flowered dresses i n the
Stewards' Enclosure; flowers and green lawns; the
roses on P h y l l i s Court w a l l ; punts and s k i f f s
l i n i n g the booms; the " B a r r i e r Club" on the Satur-
day before the Regatta. The s c a r l e t of Lady Maggy,
the y e l l o w o f C l a r e , the s t r i p e d t r o u s e r s o f F i r s t
and T h i r d , the hooped zephyrs of T.C.D. The "An-
g e l " , the "Red L i o n " and the " L i t t l e White Hart".
The r a i l w a y s t a t i o n bedecked w i t h f l a g s and bun-
t i n g . And, above a l l , to the I.C.B.C., t h a t won-
d e r f u l place a t Marsh Lock where the crew s t a y s ,
under the motherly guidance of Mrs. Tebb - the Old
House. For those who have never seen i t , i t i s
quite another world, where time, that h o r r o r o f
modern l i f e , j u s t does not matter. For those who
have ever been there a Mecca of Meocas indeed.
A f t e r the ups and downs o f the year, I.C. was
represented by an eight i n the Thames Cup and a
four i n the Wyfolda. Both crews rowed w e l l - es-
p e c i a l l y the eight which put up a f a r b e t t e r per-
formance than had a t one time seemed p o s s i b l e . The
eight won t h e i r f i r s t heat a g a i n s t 3.0.A.II., w i t h -
out being unduly pressed. T h e i r best row o f the
year, however, was i n the second round a g a i n s t a
very good F i r s t and T h i r d T r i n i t y crew, i n which
the l a t t e r , rowing extremely w e l l , won by I f l e n g -
t h s , the Fawley time being very f a s t f o r the pre-
v a i l i n g c o n d i t i o n s . Although l o s i n g , the I.C.
crew rowed r e a l l y w e l l and l i f t e d the p r e s t i g e of
the I.C.B.C. out o f the doldrums i n t o which i t had
f a l l e n i n recent years.
The four a l s o rowed w e l l , winning t h e i r f i r s t
heat a g a i n s t Be r e l a y s Bank comfortably. I n t h e i r
next round, they had a very c l o s e race w i t h London
R.C. and were unfortunate enough to h i t the booms
at the b e g i n n i n g o f the enclosures when they were
l e a d i n g and only t h i r t y s t r o k e s short of the
f i n i s h . ' *
S e v e r a l ex-I.'C.B.C. members were a l s o a c t i v e
at Henley. Three members of the Thames R.C. eight
i n the f i n a l o f the Thames Cup, one member o f the
Thames "Grand" eight and two o f t h e i r "Stewards"
f o u r as w e l l as l a s t year's "Ho. 6", who was i n the
Emmanuel f o u r i n the f i n a l o f the V i s i t o r s , had a l l
represented I.C. a t one time o r another.

AU PAIR?
One member of the college, embarking at Mar-
seilles for a holiday in Palestine, happened to
walk up the gangplank with a g i r l - a total stran-
ger. On the deck, the French captain greeted them
and addressed them in English thus: "You may talk
togezer and you may eet togezer, but you must not
sleep togezer on my boat"!
