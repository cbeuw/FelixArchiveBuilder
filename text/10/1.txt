EDITORIAL
FRESHMAN'S EONEYMppH.
This issue of FELIX, the f i r s t this term, i s
dedicated to the Freshmen. We hope that they may
find something of interest and enlightenment i n i t s
pages and we take this opportunity of welote&ng
them to Imperial College.
We a l l remember (don't we?") our own f i r s t few
â€¢bewildered days as Freshers: when we f i r s t gazed
with uncertain eyes at the strangeness of i t a l l .
We were confused, we lost our way, we talked to
strangers and accepted whatever came next, a l l ra-
ther meekly and naively. We went to free teas,
drank much beer, listened to speeches and sales
talk from professors and club captains. Come one
and a l l . A few lectures would be starting i n a day
or two and although the idea of work had not yet
penetrated the consciousness we might perhaps go
along, i f only not to miss anything. Then the"
Trials - Ah.' the Trials I - great days for ambitious
sportsmen. So each day, f u l l of new impressions,
we would wander back to our new digs and l i e on our
unbelievably hard bed whilst a kaleidoscope of pro-
fessors, notice boards, pints, secretaries, c o r r i -
dors, booklets, towers and minarets passed before
our eyes. Life, i n fact, oould not be more plea-
sant.
By the time you have read this, you w i l l a l -
ready have had a few days of this l i f e and w i l l be
beginning to get used to i t a l l . And so i t w i l l
continue a week or two. But gradually you find
yourself drawn into lectures, the free dinners w i l l
t r a i l off, the exhortations w i l l diminish i n inten-
sity and, caught i n the snares of lecture room and
laboratory, you w i l l realise that the honeymoon i s
over.
But cheer up5 The daily round i s quite l i v e l y .
Things do happen hereJ You w i l l find l i f e pleasant
enough i f you play your part. Join a club, society
- but not too many - and take an active interest i n
the affairs of your college. Read the article ad-
dressed to you by the President of your own college
Union. Finally, remember to do some work - even
in this your f i r s t term - but don't become a brown-
bagger: a university i s more than a vocational
training centre. It i s a seat of learning but also
of living, where you w i l l spend some of the happi-
est years of your l i f e .
FELIX.
Readers w i l l see that FELIX appears i n new
dress this year. Although now only four pages, the
reduced size of type enables us to print the same
amount of subject matter as before. The method of
printing allows us much greater scope i n the mat-
ter of layout and i l l u s t r a t i o n than was possible i n
the 'Roneo-ed' FELIX of last year. The new presen-
tation i s by no means f i n a l and we welcome sugges-
tions for i t s improvement.
Finality i s far off for other reasons - econo-
mic ones. With the costs of typing and printing we
are working to a very olose margin. We have resis-
ted temptation to increase the price and this means
that, to remain financially healthy, FELIX must
maintain i t s circulation of a thousand - at least.
Therefore, buy your own copy each fortnight or sub-
scribe for the year (15 issues, subscription forms
i n I.C. Union and i n Bar).
One further point. FELIX'S smiling counten-
ance depends largely on your contributions. We
w i l l accept, and print where possible and prudent,
your poems, humorous artioles, news snippets and
letters. Grind your axe on our pages: FELIX of-
fers an unrivalled forum for the exchange of ideas
and opinions.
