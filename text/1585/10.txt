Prof. Sir John Pendry, former
head of the Imperial Physics
department
Professor Sir John Pendry, FRS,
holds a Chair in Theoretical
Solid State Physics here at
Imperial. In 2014 he was awarded the
$1M Kavli Prize by the Norwegian
Academy of Science and Letters
in recognition of his work in the
field of nano-optics. This article is a
summary of an interview for Felix
that took place on September 26,
2014.
Ben: So, would you mind telling me
a little bit about yourself and your
work?
John: Well, I started here in 1981, but
thankfully they still pay me so I guess
I must still be considered worthwhile!
When I arrived here I was
interested in surface structure and
catalysis. I worked on electron
diffraction data and surface
crystallography, before looking at
how waves move in disordered solids.
This is a really difficult thing to do,
and most of my work was ignored at
the time and is only now coming to
the fore.
One result that was really
important from all this came
about when I was looking at the
transmission of light through
disordered materials – those where
the light isn’t absorbed, but also isn’t
transmitted because it’s all scattered
away. An example would be, say, a
bottle of snow.
I was able to show that this was
a bit like a maze, in that there was
one particular path along which all
the light was transmitted through
such a medium. Obviously, this can
massively increase the transmission
coefficient (the amount of light
hitting the detector compared to the
amount incident).
This result was only tested about
three years ago, but a Dutch Group
were able to increase this coefficient
by a factor of 10,000. One thing that
we’re looking at now is whether this
technique might be adapted to enable
better medical imaging through a
person’s skin.
In the mid-90’s, I moved on
to looking at optics, specifically
photonic crystals. These are weird
crystals which are black at certain
frequencies not because they absorb
light but because they don’t let any
light in. I like to say that you couldn’t
light a match inside one because
there’d be nowhere for the light to go.
This led on to working for the
Marconi Company, looking at
materials used for radar absorption
on warships. They knew that the
carbon fibres were absorbing radar
well, but didn’t know why. After
doing some work on this, it turned
out that the key wasn’t that the
material was made from carbon, but
rather that it had a fibrous nature.
Unlike most materials that you
might encounter, this meant that the
structure and not the composition
was the main determinant of the
material’s properties. Another good
example is silver – crystalline silver
is highly reflective, but in granular
form silver appears black.
We called this new class of
materials ‘metamaterials’. The
structure of the metamaterials was
actually altering their physical
properties, and they allowed
us to realise things that might
otherwise have not been possible.
In optics you’re always constrained
by the available materials, but
metamaterials raised the prospect of a
whole new science.
One such class of materials would
have negative refractive indicies.
What would this mean? Well all sorts
of weird things would happen: the
material would behave like a lens. It
