"Being
kind to one
another,
it seems,
worked out
well for the
characters
of Pride."
Based on an incredible true
story that you have probably
never even heard of, Pride
tells the story of how Welsh miners
teamed up with a group of gays and
lesbians to fight the oppression
from the Thatcher government and
her bullying antics. It shows the
unlikeliest of people coming together
forming an alliance, and the initial
struggle shown in the film for the
two groups to bond is somewhat of a
predictable starting point.
In fact, once you get to know the
general plot synopsis, the entire gist
of the film can be played out easily.
First there is the struggle for the
more flamboyant gays and lesbians
to integrate into the conservative
Welsh community, but after a few
speeches and memorable events,
there is a breakdown in prejudice and
ignorant hate, with the two groups
coming together in a touching display
of unity to march together for rights.
There is absolutely nothing new here,
but because of the way this story is
told and presented, Pride works to a
surprisingly stirring and hilarious
level.
It starts off as a pet project for
Mark (Ben Schnetzer – an American
actor who flawlessly gets by with his
Welsh accent), marching at a Gay
Pride event of 1984. Noticing that
the “mining community is being
bullied, just like we [gays and lesbians]
are”, it is that classic notion of “the
enemy of my enemy is a friend” that
gives him the idea to support the
miners. Of course, it is support that
no one asked for, and no one really
wants. At the height of homophobia
in Britain, very few people are
willing to associate with individuals
branded as “ perverts”. But one mining
village in Wales is welcome to have
them around, and accept their
generous donations. Schnetzer plays
determined and stubborn well, the
kind of attitude that gets things done,
but also is prone to attract trouble too.
Among the more forward-thinking,
open-minded people in Wales are Dai
(Paddy Considine), who first meet the
group and decide to give them a place
to stay in his living room, Cliff (Bill
Nighy) and Hefina (Imelda Staunton),
who are essentially the elders of the
community, Gwen (Menna Trussler),
who has some innocent but hilarious
questions about lesbians, and Sian
(Jessica Gunning), a housewife and
mother who takes interest in the
village politics. But for every man
and woman who is happy to welcome
them with open arms, there are those
who are actively resistant to their
input.
The initial struggling period is
marred with ups and downs. Among
the happier events is a scene in which
Jonathan (Dominic West), a member
of LGSM (Lesbians and Gays Support
the Miners), starts taking over the
dance floor with his funky moves.
You would never expect someone like
West to be in such a goofy role, but
he is perfect in it. Never too over-
the-top to be reduced to a simplistic
caricature, but a well-written
character who has more to say and do
than just have one highlight dance
sequence; it just so happens that West
dancing to ‘Shame Shame Shame’ is so
unexpected that it is that much more
enjoyable.
Mainly told from the point of view
of Joe (George MacKay), a young
man recently coming to terms with
his homosexuality, all the strange,
wonderful, new things experienced
by him are directly shown to the
audience. His first Pride march in
which there are objects being thrown
at them, plus a sign that reads “ burn
in hell”, his first party, first charity
collection, first kiss, and frequent
adventures to Wales that open his
eyes to the bigger outside world,
all the while falling behind on his
cooking studies whilst following his
passion. MacKay is a pleasantly doe-
eyed, innocent-looking addition to
have as a lead, providing a fresh set of
eyes on what is happening. Unlike the
other members of LGSM, Joe is a shy,
insecure youngster who ends up in
the group by pure chance. But as his
confidence grows and he starts taking
charge of his own future, you see the
personal journey of self-discovery
in Joe, in the midst of the progress
LGSM makes with the miners.
Speaking of personal journeys,
another heart-warming plot strand
belongs to Gethin (Andrew Scott, of
the Sherlock fame), a gay bookstore
owner who has not been back to
his home town in Wales for fear of
judgement from his mother. Scott
appears to be a master at giving the
smallest of looks and twitches on
his face, and yet portraying so many
emotions at the same time. He has
a relatively smaller role, even in the
trailers and posters he is sidelined,
but he is excellent in every scene that
is focused to his character.
The Welsh women have more fun
than their male counterparts in the
film, with a group of them, led by
Hefina and Gwen visiting gay clubs
in London, pushing their way in
despite it there being a “men only”
policy. “Oh don’t be daft” says Hefina,
as they dance away with gay men.
Staunton as always, is spectacular,
bringing a whole load of fun energy
into the mix, acting as a matriarch
of sorts, helping with the smooth
transition of outsiders coming into
their tightly-knit community, always
standing firm on the issue of equality.
Hefina is an admirable character
played by an actress who is on top
of her game. Gwen provides healthy
support, always providing great
laughs, with Jessica Gunning also as
a younger wife, but by no means less
impassioned, having her moment to
shine.
There is a lot to squeeze in. Each
character has something profound
to say and go through, but even
fleeting shots of their lives are
enough to provide the tears and the
laughs. Despite having fun with the
subject, the film never forgets to the
address the more serious, darker side
to this movement. Not everything
went smoothly, there were those
willing to take down the LGSM
movement using devious methods.
We do get hate crime taking place,
complications arising, and given how
the miners’ strike ended, you get the
feeling that not everyone has a happy
ending coming for them. Pride shows
that no matter how much something
makes sense, and no matter how
many brilliant minds and genuine
people get together to back it up,
sometimes things just are not meant
to be.
However the film does find a way
to finish on a joyous note. One that
mirrors the 1984 Pride march shown
earlier in the film, but this time with
an extra twist. A twist that will surely
have your heart melting at the sight
of human kindness, compassion and
friendship. Being kind to one another,
it seems, worked out well for the
characters of Pride.
"It just so
happens
that West
dancing
to 'Shame
Shame
Shame' is
so unex-
pected that
it is that
much more
enjoyable."
