Diary Of a Fresher, aged 18 3/4
Sunday 19th October
My roommate stole my fountain pen, alongside my “special sock” although I am more worried as to why he took that.
Massive disaster. Someone in my halls was cooking rice in their rooms (in clear contravention of Halls policy) and
they fell asleep! The rice burnt and set the ﬁre alarm off. At 2am! Outside a cute girl noticed my silk dressing
gown and smiled at me. Win; I knew Spiderman was an investment.
Monday 20th October 2014
Found out who the cute girl is from the Halls facebook group; Dorothy Wu, living in room 319. I am so in! She’s
got a roommate though so need to catch her alone. Keep walking past her kitchen slowly to try and make eye
contact with her through that glass slit in the door, but haven’t seen her yet.
Tuesday 21st
Still no sight of Dorothy.
Wednesday 22nd
I am so hungover. Went back to Ministry last night as it was the RAG Ball. There was nobody at the bar so I
bought loads of drinks. Everyone else was still dancing at 3 (maybe it’s because they were drinking loads of wa-
ter?) so I got the two night buses home alone. I fell asleep and ended up in Brixton, and didn’t have my NPower
rape alarm on me. I felt so naked.
Thurs 23rd
Yesterday was commemoration day. No idea what that is. No lectures though, which was lucky. I had so many drinks.
Managed to rewrite my lecture notes though. Gotta keep up to speed with them lectures! It only takes me four
hours a lecture, which is worrying but I’ll get better at it, right?
Better consult TSR on this one.
