“You are all grounded”
John Park sits Shiva with the Altmans in This is Where I Leave You
When the Altman patriarch
passes away it is only
natural for the rest of the
family and their significant others to
come and honour his memory. And
we all know that when siblings get
together, it does not take long for all
hell to break loose, with hurt feelings,
sibling rivalry, years of jealousy and
resentment starting to bubble up as
every minute passes under the roof.
As the matriarch, Hillary (Jane
Fonda) grounds her four children
for the next seven days as they sit
shivva for the dead dad. The four
children who gather are Paul (Corey
Stoll), Wendy (Tina Fey), Judd (Jason
Bateman), and Phillip (Adam Driver).
Each remaining Altman member has
drama and baggage of their own to
handle, which is what makes up the
running time, on the background of a
family tragedy.
Paul and his wife Annie (Kathryn
Hahn), who used to date Judd, are
struggling to get pregnant. Wendy
is a mother of two with a husband
(Aaron Lazar) more preoccupied
with his work than family, Judd is
reeling from the affair his wife Quinn
(Abigail Spencer) had with his sleazy
boss Wade (Dax Shepherd), and
Phillip is a playboy who may or may
not have found the perfect woman in
therapist Tracy (Connie Britton). And
Hillary? Well she is the mother kids
are embarrassed of being with, given
how she goes around saying things
like “the man was hung” about her
dead husband.
The crowded cast list does not
end there. Judd gets a new romantic
interest with Penny (Rose Byrne)
the sort-of high school sweetheart of
his, who is now teaching in a local ice
skating rink, and Horry (Timothy
Olyphant), an old flame of Wendy’s
is still living across the street from
the Altmans with his mother Linda
(Debra Monk). And there is a good
reason to explain this.
There is arguably way too much
history here to catch up on, with
everyone vying for some coherent
story time. So instead of delving
deeply into each sibling, we only get
fleeting shots and vague ideas of what
happened between everyone.
It is a shame the film decides to pull
away at all the wrong moments. For
instance, Wendy has a significant
past story with Horry, something that
signals heartbreak given how Wendy
declares that she will never love
someone the way she did Horry. And
in a rare, more dramatic role, Fey
does excel. She even gets the chance
to throw a good punch to protect the
Altman name. But there is a sense
This week at Imperial Cinema
Disney and arthouse cinema are
not two words that are often used
in the same sentence but this week
we are bringing you an exciting
(and slightly random) double bill
featuring both!
Maleficent
Director: Robert Stormberg
Screenplay: Linda Woolverton
Cast: Angelina Jolie,Elle Fanning
Everyone knows the story of Sleeping
Beauty: girl is cursed to prick her
finger on a spinning wheel,falls
into a deep sleep,gets saved by
her prince charming,yadda yadda
yadda.Maleficent tells the story from
the perspective of the powerful fairy
who placed the curse on Aurora
in the first place.In a clever,and
visually spectacular reworking of the
classic fairytale,Maleficent (played
by Angelina Jolie) becomes more
than just a 2-dimensional villain.

Boyhood
Director: Richard Linklater
Screenplay: Richard Linklater
Cast: Ellar Coltrane,Ethan Hawke,
Patricia Arquette
You're unlikely to ever see another
film like Boyhood.Director Richard
Linklater filmed over a 12-year
period with the same cast to chart
one boy's journey from early
childhood to late adolescence.
Through his eyes,we see Mason's
dysfunctional family unit morph
as his mother (Patricia Arquette)
jumps from one bad relationship
to another whilst his errant,
charismatic father (Ethan Hawke)
intermittently enters his life.As
Mason grows up,he displays a
perceptive wisdom beyond his years
and it becomes clear that his parents
might be the ones that are more in
need of growing up.
Boyhoodis devoid of stagey
cathartic moments and instead
chronicles the everyday events of
life: riding a bike,school,falling in
love.Under Linklater's naturalistic
direction,these seemingly mundane
moments always feel engaging and
true to life.
No matter how far removed your
life is from Mason's,it's impossible
not to see personal instances that
you can identify with.Linklater turns
what could have been a directional
gimmick into a completely authentic
way to bring realism onto the screen;
the characters literally grow up in
front of your eyes.
The result? Boyhood is an
astonishing achievement that feels
less like a film and more like an
observation of a young life.Showing

Screenplay: Jonathan Tropper
Cast: Jason Bateman, Tina Fey,
Jane Fonda, Corey Stoll
that this underdeveloped history
between Wendy and Horry are going
to waste.
What blossoms between Penny
and Judd also seem rushed. Being
the principle character, Judd needs
to have a way to get a happy ending.
Penny is pushed in front of the
cameras to act all smiley and nice
with Judd, without giving these two
characters much context to work
with.
Of course when brothers get
together, there is bound to be a
physical fight of some sorts. Insults
fly and tempers flare up, especially
when Paul tends to have anger issues
and the youngest Phillip gets a kick
out of baiting his older brother, not
so dissimilar to how August: Osage
County shows its meltdown, in one of
the film’s more dramatic moments.
The cast performs exceptionally
well, starting all the way from
the matriarch, right down to the
children and their significant love
interests. Fonda is hilarious as
the inappropriate mother having
undergone a brand new boob-job,
and the veteran actress still has what
it takes to command the screen in
her strong performance, although
the final reveal in her character is
something so poorly managed that no
actress could have made it work to a
convincing level.
The tender moments come and go,
much like the memorable comedic
scenes, but there is simply not enough
of either to truly satisfy even in just
one aspect of the film. As family
dramedies go, Shawn Levy’s This is
Where I Leave You tells a very average
story about being a middle-aged
adult, one that is elevated by a great
cast of big names.
