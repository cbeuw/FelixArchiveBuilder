8 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX

Isuspect that I was not the only
person disappointed to read
the news article “Lesson Learnt:
Never go in Dri” in last week’s issue
(Felix 1584). This awful pun aside, I
felt that the article unfortunately
misrepresented and undermined
Imperial College Union’s ‘Dri’ night,
its first ever alcohol-free club night.
The event was aimed at students
who, for various reasons, don’t drink,
and might not feel comfortable with
one of the Union’s typical boozy
nights. This includes students under
the age of 18 who cannot attend
Union events at which alcohol is
served, or even enter Union bars,
due to licensing restrictions. These
students are socially marginalized
and excluded from most of the fun
of Freshers’ Week events and are not
able to make use of the social hub that
is the Union bars.
Dri night provided an opportunity
for this group to access some of the
facilities that the rest of us take for
granted, an opportunity that around
a hundred people, many of whom will
have been under 18, took advantage
of and presumably enjoyed. In this
respect the event was a success.
The article puts forward the
contention that Dri night was
some sort of Union ghost town
experience, with tumbleweed rolling
across the sticky floors of Metric
and FiveSixEight. However, with
attendance in three figures this can’t
have been the quietest Monday night
that the Union has seen this term,
and seasoned veterans will all be able
to remember nights in the Union bars
when everyone present would have
been able to fit into a cab.
Quoting a dubious “anonymous
Union source” with criticisms of the
event, and ambiguously presenting
a photo of the inside of Metric not
taken at the event (captioned as
an ‘artist’s impression’ on page 7,
but left uncaptioned on the front
cover), doesn’t seem to be a fair
representation of the night. They
didn’t seem to ask any people who
were there if they enjoyed themselves
either, which might have given a
more accurate view of the event.
Providing events for non-drinkers,
and especially under-18s, is a worthy
goal. Indeed it was one of Chris
Kaye’s (this year’s Deputy President
(Welfare)) manifesto pledges.
This kind of unreasonable attack
on an event that benefited students
prejudices the Imperial community
against any other events that seek
to include those who can’t, don’t or
won’t drink, and negatively impacts
on their ability to interact with other
students and have a good time.

COMMENT WRITER
Dri night’s coverage does not whet the appetite
Oliver Benton’s response...
Thanks for the response; I'm glad
at least somebody,other than
the Union staff and Sabbs that
‘checked over it’,actually read the
article.
I feel that the article may have
been slightly misinterpreted.
While I can,but won't,apologise
for the puns that littered it,I do not
feel that it misrepresented Dri.
There are a huge proportion of
students at Imperial that don't
drink,and even more that don't
drink to excess.
Imperial College,and the Union,
could do a lot more to include
these students and engage with
them.How to actually achieve this
is the tricky part and something I
can't pretend to have a solution for.
Social marginalisation of any
student here is outright wrong and
everything should be done to avoid
this.
While slightly tongue in cheek,
(think of all the pun opportunities)
the‘unreasonable attack’was an
article on an event that flopped.
Well-intentioned,this loss leader
to get people to come to the Union
clearly didn't work.
Part of Felix's job is to hold the
Union to account.This is sometimes
uncomfortable,as shown by the
pre-emptive press release by the
Sabb team,but if an event doesn’t
work then that's unfortunate.
The idea to cater to non-
drinkers is a good one,only the
implementation didn’t come off.
While the choice of my sources may
seem“dubious”,unfortunately they
often want to remain anonymous
to protect their job,degree,
friendships etc.
The suggestion that my source was
fictional is false but you’re going to
have to take my word for that.

"The article
misrepresented
and
undermined
the Union's Dri
night."
