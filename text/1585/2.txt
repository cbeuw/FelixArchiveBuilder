What’s on this week:
ACC Night
20:00 - 02:00, Oct 29th, All
Union bars
With a theme of S&M and
M&S, come dressed as an
old lady or bring your best
ball gag. Or do both. I am
planning to turn up rocking
my whips and a zimmer
frame.
Tickets: £8.50 online, £9.50 on
the door
Tickets include four beers or
bombs
Last week we ran two stories
that we were worried (or did
we hope?) would cause a storm.
One was covering the amenities funds
cut, and the other was looking at the
first non-alocoholic bar night ran by
Imperial College Union. Surprisingly,
the latter story is the one that is
seemingly kicking up a storm.
We are running a whole page this
week dedicated to the news story that
only warrented about 200 words in
the first place, most of which were
tounge in cheek.
Our journalistic prowess has come
under attack, with a lot of it to do
with the “illustrative” photo we used
to accompany the article. Apparently
our credit (or lack of, as it were, for
the front page thumbnail version)
was not enough to explain how the
photo was not a completely correct
representation of the entirity of the
night.
Honestly, I thought it was hilarious,
and I am sure that at some point they
did indeed sweep Metric that night.
Let’s use this as the lesson that taught
us that photos may be louder than
words, and also that we love to rub the
Union up the wrong way every now
and then.
As I actually graduated last year
(picture related), this Wednesday I
spent the day popping in and out of
the Office congratulating friends and
trying to help my Section Editors at
the same time. Credit to them, we
actually managed to make this issue
with time to spare, a rare occurance
in the production of the Felix
newspaper.
In other news from the Felix Office,
we are so, so close to completion. We
are just waiting for the infamous
semi-circular desk to appear, which
should arrive Monday. We have a
dictophone now, so can start running
wire taps into the office of Chris Kaye,
Deputy President (Betrayal). We also
have lots of stationary that we have
stolen from the Union in the dead of
the night when the newspaper layout
gets too much. If anyone needs any
post-it notes, give us a shout.
Finally, we saw the launch of our
amazing, brand new website last
week. Personally, I was dozing in the
corner after a particularly stressful
submission of the paper the night
before, but I heard that it all went
smoothly and was launched on time.
We are still uploading articles onto
the site a few batches at a time. The
entire pdfs of each issue are still
there to have a scroll through, in case
you want to relive the shadow-dick
phenomenon from Issue 1583.
If you want to see it in all its glory
too (the centrefold itself, not the
actual penis shadow), come down
to the Office. You might as well ask
us how you can get involved whilst
you're here.
PHILIPPA SKETT
FELIX EDITOR
SKETT’S BOX OF SHAME
Apologies for some mistakes in Issue
1584. These were:
- Missing some copy editors off the
roll call on the editorial page due to a
formatting hitch
- The DramSoc advert, the iPOP
advert and the photo in Televion
were of a terrible quality, due to
a technical diﬃculty that occured
as we sent the issue to print. We
apologise.
- Losing the font for Diary of a
Fresher and having to use one that
is more akin to a secondary school
homework piece then a satire section
of a newspaper.
CURRENT FELIX VACANCIES
We are looking for a new team of
Web Editors, to manage online
content, approve comments, keep our
site in check and get everything onto
the website by Friday afternoon.
If you enjoy website management,
have used the internet before or just
really want some free stationary,
come down to the Office or get in
touch and we can show you the ropes.
Don’t know how computers work?
We don’t either, so don’t worry about
having any prior experience.
Email us if you are keen:
