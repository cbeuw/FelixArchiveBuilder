Eat
Have you eaten today? If you haven't,
please try and have at least a little
bit to eat, even if it's just some fruit,
a few almonds, or an egg. I know
sometimes, it might feel like a
monumental effort to take care of
yourself, especially if you've been
having an off day, but your physical
health is important and neglecting it
will only lead to more exhaustion.
Sleep
Along the same lines, have you had
enough sleep? Sleep deprivation,
especially when it becomes a frequent
habit, can have a terrible effect
on both your mood and physical
health. If you've been struggling
with insomnia for a while, it might
be a sign of something bigger at
work, so you might want to consider
consulting your GP.
Also, your health is much more
important than your grades! If
you're having problems with time
management, try consulting that one
friend who always somehow seems to
have everything planned out, or talk
to your personal/academic tutor.
Take Breaks
Have you taken a break? Some time
between problem sheets to just relax
not only helps you unwind, but is
also proven to help you be more
efficient overall. I know you have a
deadline, but taking a few minutes to
just stretch your legs and take a few
deep breaths won't make you fail that
coursework.
Take your medication
This is the one I always struggle with,
I know it sucks balls to have to take
medication, but they were prescribed
for a reason, and making sure to
take them in their required dosage is

Writing this article was
a challenge for me: the
discussion of weight loss
methods can be difficult for both
reader and writer. However, with the
topic of laxative abuse sweeping my
newsfeed I felt it only appropriate
to share my own experiences. Last
week saw calls for tighter regulation
of laxative sales, with 14 year old
watchdog actors buying up to 60
laxatives at once in supermarkets and
chemists despite the prohibition of
laxative purchase under the age of 16.
I have battled with an eating
disorder for almost eleven years.
Throughout those years my eating
disorder, like my body, has changed
in shape and form. At times of
desperation, despite knowing the
futility of laxative abuse, I have
turned to laxatives and diet pills.
Throughout my teens I successfully
purchased laxatives and diet pills
from a cross section of shops
including Superdrug and Morrisons.
In my university years I have
purchased and abused diet pills and
laxatives from an array of shops.
Most notably, I was able to purchase
tablets, from Boots, to prevent the
absorption of fat. These tablets are
incredibly dangerous and should
only be used by obese patients
under supervision of a physician,
nonetheless, I was able to purchase
them on a self service check out
without question. The leaflet inside
merely advises against the use of
diet pills for those of a BMI below
18.5 - the minimum weight to height
requirement to be ‘healthy.’ I find it
outrageous that products like these
are so readily available particularly
when super-strength throat lozenges
are kept behind the counter.
Countless numbers of people abuse
laxatives and diet pills regardless of
age and gender, many of whom suffer
from an eating disorders, others
who succumb to societal pressures.
Laxative and diet pill abuse is a
serious issue and can cause lifelong
health problems and even death. The
abuse of laxatives can cause major
electrolyte imbalances and does not
actually cause weight loss. Many
diet pills have serious and unknown
side effects. Personally, I suffer from
many digestive problems due to
abuse of laxatives and diet pills in
conjunction with other behaviours.
There is not a day which I do not
regret abusing laxatives and diet
pills despite using them relatively
infrequently.
I firmly believe it is time to
implement more stringent
regulations on the sales of diet pills
and laxatives in order to tackle the
growing problem of their abuse,
particularly amongst youths.
Raising the price, introducing a
maximum number of tablets per
sale and implementing current
age restrictions would reduce the
accessibility and thereforew the
prevalence of laxative and diet
pill abuse. It’s time for a change as
ultimately laxative and diet pill abuse
is a form of drug abuse with grave
consequences.
If you are concerned about your own
mental health,or that of a loved one,
there are people out there you can
talk to who can give you advice,or will
be there to listen.

So I know for most of you, term
has started to pick up, and
sometimes, in between various
coursework deadlines, problem
sheets, and even socialising, it might
be difficult to remember to take care
of yourself. I'm definitely guilty of
becoming so absorbed in my work
and general worrying about life that I
forget anything else matters. So here
are my top four self-care tips, in case
anyone else needs reminding.
crucial for a swift recovery, so please
take care of yourself by listening to
your doctor!
