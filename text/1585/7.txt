Is it bad to be All About That Bass?
Meghan Trainor’s super-
catchy ‘All About That
Bass’ has been “getting
flak” (as she puts it) from all angles,
from people of all walks of life, all of
whom seem to have something to say
about this seemingly body-positive
bubblegum pop song.
With the number of people
jumping on the bandwagon of hating
on this song, it would be really easy to
write an article picking at all the flaws
in the arguments against this song. Of
course, it’s easy for them to say that
the opening line,
“Because you know
I’m all about that bass
‘Bout that bass, no treble”
is completely ridiculous, given that
the song in fact, is not entirely bass
based. But petty niggles aside, the
song can have an entirely different
interpretation, depending how
pragmatic or fastidious you choose
to be.
Trainor, who claims not to consider
herself a feminist, puts it simply: “we
wanted to write a fun song for the
world, and we thought, why not do a
song about loving yourself and loving
your body, because I don’t think girls
really love themselves as much as
they should”.
“I see the magazine workin’ that
Photoshop
We know that shit ain’t real
C’mon now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty, just raise ‘em
up
‘Cause every inch of you is perfect
From the bottom to the top”
On the surface, Meghan Trainor
appears to succeed. It doesn’t take a
feminist to recognise that promoting
the idea of beauty not being defined
by the photoshopped images we see so
frequently in the media is undeniably
positive and empowering.
If you haven’t heard this song, by
some miracle, you might not know
that the message is aimed mainly at
girls and women who “ain’t no size
two”. But where the song tends to
fall down and be reprimanded by
feminists, is in the choruses.
“Yeah, my mama she told me don’t worry
about your size
She says, ‘Boys like a little more booty to
hold at night’.”
Now of course, this isn’t great. It’s
never a good idea to base your self-
esteem on your attractiveness to the
opposite sex. While I disagree heartily
with needing male validation for
self-acceptance, it is true that women
who are, as one article berating
the song describes it, “pleasantly
chubby”, are constantly told that
they are unattractive and unworthy
throughout their lives. They often
grow up being told that no one will
ever be attracted to them, and it can
take a long time to organically gain
enough self-confidence to fight this,
and accept that they are worthy of
respect. For once, it’s nice to be told,
truthfully, that (some) men will fancy
you, whether you’re a size six or a
sixteen or a twenty-six.
Trainor doesn’t generally engage
in feminist discussion. It is likely
that she, along with the majority of
listeners of this song, aren’t reading
into this song with the same ferocity
and vigilance as those who with to
rebuke it. When Trainor says,
“You know I won’t be no stick figure
silicone Barbie doll
So if that’s what you’re into then go
ahead and move along”
she isn’t saying that it’s wrong for
any heterosexual man to be attracted
to any woman who doesn’t fit her
body type, or indeed that all men
will find her attractive. What she’s in
fact saying is that she is the way she
is, she is attractive, and if you don’t
think so, then that’s not her problem.
When you take it on a basic level, as
written by someone who really just
wants curvy girls to feel good about
themselves, that’s pretty body-
positive, isn’t it?
Of course, this isn’t the only
problem that people are finding with
this song.
“I’m bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches
that
No I’m just playing. I know you think
you’re fat
But I’m here to tell ya
Every inch of you is perfect from the
bottom to the top”
The question that arises here is
whether or not this is name-calling
or skinny-shaming. I don’t think,
and I’m sure that the writers of this
track don’t think, that this addresses
all skinny girls as bitches. This
addresses the subset of people who
may have something vindictive to
say about voluptuous girls, who, by
and large, will not be of a full-figured
body type. This comment is aimed
at those, particularly those who are
skinny, who may consider themselves
superior because of their diminutive

size. This isn’t an attack on all
skinny women, suggesting that they
only have a right to feel good about
themselves as they have the same
body insecurities as larger women. It
doesn’t force a limited definition of
attractiveness, it just points out that
women (whose attractiveness is often
marginalised) can be just as hot as
those prescribed by the media, and
deserve to know it.
In my opinion, this song is
empowering to women who don’t
fit the culturally preferred norm
of minimised curves. While the
song might not be perfect, it doesn’t
encourage fatter women to start
slinging mud at skinny girls. It may
contain concepts that are problematic
when examined under the
microscope, but it’s certainly far from
toxic. It’s incredibly rare to see music
aimed at the acceptance of curvier
women (while big booty pride is
everywhere at the moment, it’s mostly
within the realms of complimenting a
itty bitty waist), so why not just let us
bigger girls have this one?
Those who criticise this song seem
to think that nothing that preaches
acceptance is valid, unless it preaches
consistent acceptance on all levels.
This is a gallant aim, but it simply
doesn’t exist. Meghan Trainor is
using her personal identification
as a curvy girl to encourage other
girls to feel good about themselves,
and if even one person who has low
self-esteem feels even a little bit more
confident about themselves in any
way whatsoever, then this song is a
positive influence. Calling for the
song to be banned serves only to deny
girls who identify with it any outlet
for their personal acceptance, which is
by no means fair.
