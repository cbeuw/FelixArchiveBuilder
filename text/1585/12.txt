JAMIE DUTTON
TECH EDITOR
Hello and welcome to a new
academic year at Imperial
College–“A world famous centre
for engineering and technology”
(according to that bloke who
narrates The Apprentice).
I'll be your section editor this
year alongside Osama Awara
–you may remember him
from such articles last year as
“5 Things Consoles Are Killing”
and “Cyber Black Market Is No
More”.We are both keen on our
gadgets and technology and will
hopefully keep you entertained
every week.
While this section has been
sorting itself out,a lot of major
press releases and technological
developments have been missed
out.If you've picked up a new
piece of tech in the last few
months then we want you to
contribute to our section with a
review,or some comments.It is
very important that we get lots
of contributors,to avoid bias in
our reviews.
But it's not just gadgets we are
concerned about.We also want
articles about website news,
internet security or anything else
you think would fit this page.
So if you want to review a
shiny-new phone,recommend
what should be written about
or contribute in any way,please
don't hesitate to e-mail us at:

You may have heard about
internet fast-lanes over the
Summer and it’s been a highly
contentious issue particularly in the
US. Most of us have grown up on an
internet where all websites have been
treated equally, where data exchange
is not biased towards any particular
company or brand.
However, in January this year
Federal Courts in the US nullified
a ruling laid out by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC)
stating that it is illegal for internet
service providers (ISPs) to block
online traffic or offer preferential
treatment. The consequence of this
overruling is that the massive ISPs
in America (Verizon, Comcast) can
give wealthy websites access to ‘fast-
lanes’. The concept is fairly simple
– multimillion dollar companies
pay the ISPs a fee depending on how
quickly they want consumers to
access their content. The ISPs then
organise the rate of data exchange
between the website and the
consumer. This system is analogous
to premium airline boarding services
where people willing to spend more
money can get on the aircraft faster.
The idea of ‘net neutrality’ is that
everyone queues in the same line for
internet access with no bias towards
rich or successful websites.
So what is the benefit of the fast-
lane system? One argument is that
the revenue brought in from big
websites can be invested in improving
consumer service; upgrading
technology, supplying fast-internet
to a wider range of people and
generally improving the performance
of the internet for everyone. This is
making the large assumption that
the ISPs aren’t just going to use the
money to fill their pockets, which is
a realistic issue in the US where the
competition for internet service is
low (or even zero in monopolised
regions). Companies such as Comcast
and Verizon offer poor service for
astronomical prices, just because they
are able to and canning net neutrality
is not going to assist this sort of issue.
The main victims of this system
are start-up companies. Many of
the companies, paying significant
amounts of money, would not be
where they are today without net
neutrality because in the past, the
internet has been a fair battlefield
for competition. Companies such
as Google and Youtube became
successful because they were proven
by the internet-visiting public
that they were superior to their
competitors. Today, a new start-
up search engine or video-hosting
website would have to struggle even
more to gain success with the major
players in the market controlling
the fast-lanes. People thinking of
accessing these new budding sites
would be either significantly slowed
down or blocked completely, thss
is the nature of the absence of net
neutrality.
However, it is likely that consumers
could also be negatively affected
by this ruling. It is in the realms of
possibility that ISPs would be able to
charge extra for customer access to
websites that require more bandwidth
(such as Youtube or Netflix). In high-
competition areas, this could result
in the bulk of the internet being
basically inaccessible.
Many people in the US realise this
is a realistic obstacle in the way of
their ability to freely surf the web
in the foreseeable future. The FCC
welcomed comments from the public
on their opinions on the abolishment
of net neutrality and over 3.7 million
comments were received in total
(smashing previous FCC record of 1.4
million comments on Janet Jackson’s
Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction
in 2005). A study of the comments
showed that less than 1 percent
of commenters were against net
neutrality – evidence that the internet
community is not one to piss-off.
Fortunately for those in support
of net neutrality, there is one man
who has been a key component in
preventing fast-lanes in becoming
widespread occurrence – Barack
Obama. In fact in 2007, before his
reign as US president began he
stated that he and his party would be
explicitly against an abolishment of
net neutrality and said that this sort
of system “destroys one of the best
things about the internet – which
is that there is incredible equality
there”. And perhaps unlike some
other of his policies, he has stuck
to his guns on this subject, stating
on the 9th
October 2014, that he is
“unequivocally” committed to net
neutrality. Another major supporter
is Tim Berners-Lee, the grandfather
of the internet. He urged, in March
2014, that internet users insist on
the development of a “digital bill of
rights” that would “advance a free and
open web for everyone”.
Sufficient ISP competition in
the UK and an EU law (set in April
2014) blocking the ISP’s ability to
charge traffic-heavy websites for
faster network access means that
this is unlikely to affect you. But it
is certainly worth at least thinking
of people in the US, the richest
economy in the world, whose citizens
may have to pay over-the-odds for
services freely available worldwide.
For awareness about the trouble faced
by millions of American citizens,
you may have been affected by
the “Internet Slowdown Day” that
took place on the 10th September
2014. Many websites with a variety
of renown and wealth came out in
support of net neutrality and slowed
down access to their content and
displayed a “spinning wheel of death”,
showing what a world without net
neutrality could be like.
The whole situation is fairly
similar to the protests against the
Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and
PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) in January
2012. Over 115,000 websites joined
the protest and the legislation was
significantly altered in favour of the
internet’s opinions on the matter.
