“Once I had
the Harry
Potter
aspect under
control, it was
much simpler
to get people
interested”
wouldn’t even need to be shaped, a
simple slab of it could do the job.
I was working on this one
Sunday morning (which as Head of
Department sometimes feels like
the only time you get to do your own
research!) when I realised that the
lens could be ‘perfect’ – it wouldn’t be
limited to resolving things the size
of the wavelength as normal lenses
are – it’d be something quite new and
extraordinary.
For a while I thought that I must
have made a mistake somewhere.
Everyone agreed, but no one could
find the mistake. So eventually I
published the paper under the rather
provocative title The Perfect Lens.
That was back in 2000, and there was
a big storm over it. Lots of people got
very upset, and even now continue to
insist that I was wrong. But they’re
just digging holes, and as the holes get
deeper their voices get fainter.
In the end that became my most
famous (or infamous!) paper, and is
at over 5,000 citations and counting.
The lens we’d come up with broke the
Law of Abbe, which says that the size
of the wavelength is the best that you
can do in optics.
Using things that you’d ordinarily
think were not lens-like at all, like
metallic silver, we were able to
increase light intensity by factors of
up to 100,000. This is getting on for
what a laser can do. But our nanoscale
concentrations of light would be far
less expensive and dangerous than a
high-power laser.
These incredibly intense
concentrations of light lead us to
another amazing thought. Light
doesn’t normally ‘switch’ with itself.
What I mean is that two photons
rarely interact in a useful manner.
Electrons are very good at this,
they can scatter off each other, and
modern electronics work off this
principle. But with light, in order
to get it to interact you normally
have to change it into an electron,
then interact with it before changing
it back into a photon. But at these
intense concentrations, light might
begin to interact with itself – we could
possibly make routing switches and
optical chips, maybe even one day
we’ll be able to do computing with
light.
To properly understand this, we
have to throw away Snell’s law and
go back to Maxwell’s Equations.
In fact, let’s go all the way back
to Einstein. He talked about how
space can be stretched or squashed,
and that light rays are affected by
this distortion. Now we know that
Maxwell’s equations differ from
Snell’s law in that they deal with
fields of force, rather than rays. How
do the field lines behave when space
gets distorted?
Well, it turns out they behave like
they’re embedded in space. I like to
think of this as wires in a rubber sheet
(the kind that people often use to
visualise space) – they move with the
distortion. So we can control light be
stretching and pulling space. That’s
all good, but we can’t really pull space
at will, we’re not black holes.
It turns out that we don’t need to.
We can use General Relativity to
write down Maxwell’s equations in
a different format, and the metric
(a measure of how squashed space
is) sits exactly where we’d expect
the refractive index to sit in the
equations. So we don’t need to squash
space to make like switch, rather
we can do this just by changing the
refractive index that the light’s in,
which has the same effect as changing
the distortion of the space the light
is in.
It turns out that the materials you
need to do this are rather exotic,
and have negative refractive indices.
Now most people wouldn’t light
up when they saw this set of partial
differential equations, but it turns
out that they let us design a cloaking
device. The field lines deviate, they
don’t go through the object but also
don’t scatter away – they come back
together on the far side of the object.
Once I had the Harry Potter aspect
under control, it made it much
simpler to get people interested.
The outreach has been fun, and the
work has led to me being awarded
the Kavli Prize for this so-called
‘transformation optics’.
Recently we’ve been looking
to concentrate light in more
interesting ways, using more complex
transformations. We can even do
an inversion, which basically turns
things inside out.
Imagine that we have a slab of
silver, and then the electrons in the
silver form waves on the surface of
the sea of delocalised electrons.
We call these surface plasmons. A
molecule at the surface will radiate
plasmons off to infinity, but if we
do an inversion suddenly the points
swap around.
The infinity becomes the origin,
and vice versa. Because we change the
energy scale, the light at the point of
origin gets slower and slower as the
energy from infinity piles up. We can
basically crush light to intensities a
million times more than what we had
before.
By doing different mathematical
transformations on the silver, we can
create all sorts of different structures.
In fact, we’ve been able to make a
radar dish that weighs a few hundred
grams, where a conventional concave
lens would weigh ten or twenty times
as much. We have a ‘flat lens’ that
refracts differently at its centre to
at its edge, thus allowing us to focus
light. This was commissioned by
Boeing, and looks like a poppadom.
Other companies like Toyota are
interested in these because they
might be able to use them in collision
avoidance radar in driverless cars
– the reduced size compared to a
conventional lens would bring all
sorts of advantages.
We’ve also been looking into
developing phased radar arrays,
which instead of sweeping a beam
around the sky simply sit on a silicon
block that delivers the right phase
of light to the lens. When a specific
phase hits a specific part of the lens
it sends the light in a particular
direction.
These could be a lot cheaper and
plug into a USB port, so Bill Gates is
interested as it might enable internet
access to be brought to remote
communities, for example in Africa.
Or we might be able to use this to do
MRI scans that are less risky as there
are no RF fields going all over the
place that can heat things up in your
body.
B: Wow. That's quite a set of
achievements! I don't even know
where to start or what to ask. I'll
need some time to think about it
I guess. For now though, just one
question: are you hoping to get any
more invites from Scandinavian
Academies, perhaps to Stockholm?
J: I would like to have a flat in central
London one day, so that would be
nice! I had a lovely week in Norway
when I won the Kavli, so we’ll see
what happens next.
B: Good luck! We'll be in touch.
