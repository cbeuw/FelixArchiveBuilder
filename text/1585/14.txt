Shonda’s legal murder mystery
John Park learns How to Get Away with Murder
"This is a
sharp, fast-
paced legal
thriller
with lots
of murder
and lots of
sex."
"Essentially
whenever
[Viola]
Davis is on
the screen,
very little
can go
wrong."
That’s how you get away
with murder, says professor
Annalise Keating, played by the
ferociously talented Viola Davis, as
she walks away from a blackboard in
her criminal law college class. “I want
to be her,” says one of her students,
and we do not blame her for feeling
this way. Annalise Keating is a tough,
shark of a criminal defence attorney,
comparable to the great Patty Hewes
(Glenn Close) of Damages.
ABC’s new ratings hit, How to Get
Away with Murder, made with the
backing of executive producer Shonda
Rhimes, who currently has three hit
shows under her name airing on the
same night over in the States, benefits
greatly from having such a firm,
untouchable, ambiguous heroine
leading the rest of the talented cast.
Morally dubious and unpredictable
at every turn, this new legal thriller
of the 2014-15 season is simply an
unmissable treat. Davis provides a
cool, slick figure who is the definition
of a confident career woman. She
loves a challenge in the courtroom,
and does not let a significant setback
make a dent in her case for her clients.
Essentially, whenever Davis is on the
screen, very little can go wrong. She
has weak spots too, however, ones that
are shown in her private moments,
and Davis shows that she excels
not only in the earthy, dominating
courtroom scenes, but she also
knocks it out of the park in her more
vulnerable moments in which she
looks truly frightened for whatever
reason.
The series has a similar format
to Damages. Using flashforwards
and flashbacks, we see a group of
Professor Keating’s students trying
to cover up a murder. Then we
rewind to three months ago, when
they started in Professor Keating’s
Criminal Law 100 class. The five
students assist Professor Keating
and her two associates with their
high-profile criminal cases, not all of
them murders, in a self-concluding,
criminal-case-of-the-week type of
format, then we get what appears to
be a season-long story arc that deals
with the disappearance, and eventual
murder of a college student, all the
while developing the characters of the
main cast.
What is quickly established is the
nature and dynamic of the five main
students who get the chance to work
for Professor Keating. Wes Gibbons
(Alfred Enoch) was only barely
accepted off the college waiting list,
Connor Walsh (Jack Falahee) is a sly
young man using his sexuality for
information, Michaela (Aja Naomi
King) is an ambitious, driven woman
who wouldn’t think twice about
backstabbing, Laurel Castillo (Karla
Souza) is the quietest one but this
by no means affects her intellectual
capabilities, and Asher (Matt
McGorry) is just as keen as everyone
else, but with perhaps the sharpest
sense of humour. The chemistry the
young members of the cast share is
impeccable; there is a fiery dynamic
among the finely assembled group,
and they do not hold back the rest
of the more experienced cast one
bit. Enough time is spent with each
student every week to reveal more
about them to the audience, and it is
the gradual revelation of everyone’s
true nature that keeps us guessing
about who we should be rooting for.
Annalise’s associates at her law
firm also have meaty roles to play.
Bonnie Winterbottom (Liza Weil)
is not as nice as she first appears to
be, although getting the job done
to help the case as a trustworthy
second-in-command is what makes
her valuable. Very little is known
about Frank Delfino (Charlie Weber)
for the moment, aside from the fact
that he likes sleeping with female
students. But the way he mysteriously
broods and goes about his days
helping Annalise suggests that he
has a lot more going on than what
is initially suggested. Tom Verica
plays Annalise’s husband Sam,
who also becomes entangled in all
the flashback/forward drama and
mysteries.

Shonda’s other
money-making
shows
Grey'sAnatomy,now in its
eleventh season,is almost
unrecognisable from its first
season now.More than half of
the original interns are gone now,
residents and attendings have
come and gone,but at least we
still have Meredith Grey (Ellen
Pompeo) working in the world's
most promiscuous hospital to be
able to call the show what it is.
Marital troubles are on the
horizon for Meredith and Derek
Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey),
also for Callie (Sara Ramirez)
and Arizona (Jessica Capshaw),
although the biggest storyline
here is the introduction of yet
another half-sister of Meredith,
Dr Maggie Pierce (Kelly
McCreary),whose birth parents
are Richard Weber (James
Pickens Jr.) and Ellis Grey (Kate
Burton),who is also Meredith's
mother.Get ready for drama,
along with some thundering
medical emergencies and
heartbreaking patient stories.
Scandalis crazier than ever in its
4th season.
Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington
–where’s her Emmy?!) wanted to
get away from it all,but it does
not take long before she is called
back to help be Washington,
D.C.’s best fixer.President Grant
(Tony Goldwyn) is still clearly not
over her,whereas his wife Mellie
(Bellamy Young–where's her
Emmy?!) is struggling to come
to terms with her son's sudden
death.
Everyone in the cast beautifully
performs the word-heavy,speedy
dialogue,and the amount of lies
and deception that start piling
up week after week is asking for
more and more trouble.When
it all comes to a head,expect
nothing but fireworks.
this acronym will become a thing), in
that unlike the majority of American
network television shows that tend
to have 20+ episodes per season, this
series will only have 15. So instead
of filler episodes of middling quality
that drag on until some shocking
series finale leaves a massive
cliffhanger, it seems more likely that
there is a clearer sense of direction
and structure to the way things are
headed. This is a sharp, fast-paced
legal thriller with lots of murder and
lots of sex.
Despite the many, many positives,
it’s not a perfect show. Not quite yet
anyway. There is a lot to squeeze
in to the 40-minute episode block,
and because of this certain elements
of the storytelling are sacrificed.
Showing how each case is solved
takes the biggest hit, as very often
loose ends are tied up in the most
ridiculous fashion, court proceedings,
confessions and investigations
happen within seconds, and the
superhero group of lawyers and
students assembled are capable of
doing quite literally anything that
helps them win a case. Some narrative
tension is undoubtedly lost as there
are very few difficulties that need
overcoming.
But it is a new show with plenty of
potential. The season-long story arc
is setting up the show to be highly
addictive.
