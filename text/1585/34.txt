34 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX

In an embarrassing turn of events
an anonymous Deputy President
(Welfare) Chemist emailed
Hangman this week with a scoop.
After calculating the £/%mol of
ethanol and contrasting it between
Eastside and 568 it was found that
it is actually cheaper to get drunk at
Eastside.
This 57 page treatise, purportedly
the subject of his final year project
and the culmination of four years
of Chemistry is, however, drier than
an ambitious and well-intentioned
non-alocoholic night at a charity ran
establishment.
If you do really want a cheap pint,
It has been reported this week that
a first year biochemistry student
voted for one of the candidates
running for RAG deputy halls officer
because “he recognised her from
lectures.”
Speaking to Hangman, the student
said that he “had no idea what she was
actually running for,” but had seen
her in the chemistry café.
Once the position was explained
to him, he realised it was essentially
being an unpaid club rep, and he was
mortified. He then went on to RON
all other candidates.
However, despite this initial scorn,
the fresher in question did apparently
find that voting brought out his inner
Felix was very sad to hear this
week of the passing of the
Union’s Membership Services
Manager, Dr. Phil Power. While
the exact causes of death are not yet
known, rumours from the Union
Building are suggesting a freak
accident involving a pewter tankard,
a minibus instruction manual and
Deputy President (Betrayal), Khris
Caye, who he was due to meet that day
for a casino trip.
Dr. Power was born in 1880 in
England, British Empire. A keen
scientist, he secured a role at the
Royal College of Science, studying
Mathematics under Fermat and
Pythagoras, for which he got a first
class degree. However the general
debauchery of the Royal School
of Mines attracted him to shift
allegiance and complete a PhD in
1911, as well as becoming a popular
fixture at the annual RSM Dinner.
During his PhD, he met author H.
G. Wells, and the two of them went
on to found Imperial College Union,
where Phil has been working for the
last 100 years.
There are rumours that Phil
invented the minibus, although
these are exaggerated. What is true,
however, is how he introduced
the minibus to Imperial – a sight
on campus now just as famous as
penicillin, Queen’s Tower, and
the RCSU Sex Sofas. Phil would
meticulously care for each and
every minibus under his ownership
as if they were his own children:
checking oil levels, washer fluid and
seat bounciness every evening over
a glass of port. Phil confided to Felix
last month that he planned to set up
Minibus Etiquette lessons, which
were stalled pending the delivery of
suitable port to the Union Bar.
Another notable fact about Phil
was his title of Tankard Baron, an
honorific title bestowed upon him in
1908 by King George.
Whilst Phil never took up his
seat in the House of Lords, he did
make sure to keep all of the Union’s
tankards in tip-top condition
in case the monarch was ever to
come and inspect them. Much do
the disappointment of DP(B), no
monarch is yet to visit even if he does
have a giant 50 inch portrait of the
Queen.
There are many other fun stories to
share about Dr. Power, ranging from

Wetherspoons is preferable, where the
conversation with the local clientele
is excellent. Alternatively, you can
take a visit to a certain bar in Fulham
that does £7.80 jugs of beer on a
Wednesday.
It is reported that should you take
the editor in chief of Felix for a night
out in Wetherspoons, she will proceed
to incoherently tweet, demand rounds
of tequila and then attempt to strip
innocent men.

Affairs Officer for the City and
Guilds Union, James Murphy, was
unavailable for comment.
politician.
“Although I want nothing to do
with whatever this “RAG” is, I’ve only
been here two weeks and already I feel
really involved with the Union.”
Unfortunately, he did later state
that he only tended to vote “for hot
girls.”
Union staff were not officially
available for a comment on record
but are reportedly ecstatic at reaching
out to a single fresher, claiming that
it shows how they are enhancing the
student voice.
Other students have been actively
campaigning, with a reportedly very
tense race currently in play between
two year reps in biology.
Said one of the candidates “I really
want to make a difference in my
department, because that is what this
is all about right? We really should
get podcasts of lectures out.”
When asked if he was doing this to
fill up his CV, he denied it, although
did at a later date admit he thought
there were no job opportunities for
biologists anymore.
He went on to say that if he lost,
he could potentially fill more lines
on his CV as a redundant Academic
Affairs Officer.
Said his opponent, “I really couldn’t
give a shit, but I heard all of the
college meetings come with free
sandwiches.”

West Basement on a dark and stormy
night. However, one person who can
describe the man better than anyone
else is Mr. Caye. In an exclusive
interview with Felix, he revealed that
‘Phil was a great man, always up for a
bit of a punt at the Casino and showed
me things you can do with minibuses
I never knew. Did you know that
that new blue one has a built in De
Lorean machine?’ Subsequently, he
referred himself to himself for some
counselling, and then proceeded to
have a few drinks at the Union’s new
Whet night.
Ed note: Thankfully, Dr. Power has not
actually died. He has left his role at the
Union and will be the Faculty Education
Officer at the Faculty of Engineering.
