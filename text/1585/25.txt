Contrasting Worlds - The 2014 Turner Prize

Kamil McClelland assesses the contrived controversy of this year’s prize
"This year's
competition
went off
with little
more than a
whimper"
Tate Britain’s two main shows
may be similar in name but
in reality are worlds apart.
The first, an exhibition of J.M.W.
Turner’s late works, is a life-affirming
homage to one of Britain’s greatest
painters and offers glimpses into the
beginnings of modern art. The other,
shamefully named after this great
artist, is something of an anticlimax.
The Turner Prize, now in its 30th year,
is meant to showcase the best of what
British art has to offer, helping define
how the country’s art shall progress.
Well, if that is true, it’s not looking
good; this year’s celebrations went off
with little more than a whimper.
The Turner Prize has never shied
away from controversy; in fact, it has
almost become a defining feature
of the show. This was especially true
back in the late 90’s when the Young
British Artists – Damien Hirst,
Tracey Emin and the like – were
beginning to establish themselves
on the art scene. Whether this art
is actually any good is a debate for
another time but it was certainly
new and exciting and something that
forced you to reconsider how you
viewed art. More recently though,
the Turner Prize has too consciously
tried to be controversial, engineered
to provoke a reaction as opposed to
simply displaying the best of Britain’s
current art and letting us decide what
to make of it. The public has grown
weary, and the formula for success
that had once worked so well is now
backfiring, pushing the Prize into
irrelevance.
So as you can see I had my doubts as
I entered the gallery but I tried to not
let this cloud my judgment. I can’t
say the first artist, James Richards,
made it easy for me: seeing a flower
slowly being stroked across a man’s
sphincter gave quite a jarring first
impression. Oh Turner Prize, how I
missed you!
Rosebud by Richards explores
censorship of artwork, showing
close-ups of art books in Tokyo where
the genitalia has been scratched out
to comply with their strict laws. It
is pornographic, shocking, asking
whether art can ever be censored.
But it is also meandering, tiresome, a
story with no plot.
I was hoping, after the torment
of Richards’ piece, for things to get
better. It was Tris Vonna-Michell’s
turn: not the best of starts when
even the explanation of his works
described them as ‘confusing’. How
was I going to manage? But seriously,
what was his work even supposed to
be? I was trying to create meaning
for it in my head: perhaps it was
a comment on the confusion and
neuroticism of the modern world. It
was as if the space had been thrown
together, a random collection of
slideshows and photographs that
added nothing to your experience.
All the while, an incomprehensible
voice played over the speakers, like
the stream-of-consciousness of a
madman. Then came his film, where
he takes you on a journey back to
Berlin, searching for a place that no
longer exists. Was he trying to look at
the confusion of memory and reality?
Who knows? Probably not even him.
Three of the four installations
this year were video works, a sign of
the times but also a shame: I would
have liked to see a greater range of
media. Video art is not like other art
forms where you can lapse in and
out of consciousness and still have a
sense of what is going on. Video art
requires your full attention, all the
time. Three video works, then, was
overwhelming and quite fatiguing,
especially as some of the artists
expected you to sit through over 50
minutes of video. I see myself as a
patient person but this is taking the
piss a bit. No one has time for that!
Video collages are very in vogue at
the moment, suggestive of a post-
internet generation that has grown
up with the digital revolution. How
to portray this online world and its
cultural repercussions seems to be
a real point of debate in art at the
moment. Video and sound art seems
to be one answer as artists struggle
to manipulate orthodox media.
However, the attempts provided
at the Turner Prize have proven
disappointing, not able to boil down
the essence of this world into succinct
pieces of art.
As you can tell, I wasn’t too
impressed with what I saw. The artists
are nominated based on exhibitions
put on over the past 12 months and
these previous exhibitions are also
what determines the winner so what
is on display really has no influence
on the final outcome (thankfully).
Some of these previous exhibitions
were actually rather widely praised,
most notably Duncan Campbell’s
entry for the Venice Biennale. It
is such a shame, then, that what is
on show here really does nothing –
especially seeing as you are expected
to pay £11 to enter.
The remaining video artist,
Duncan Campbell, built on his
Irish background to create a mock
documentary exploring the country’s
turbulent past, quite a poignant piece
but just as exciting as you would
expect a fake news piece from forty
years ago to be. Sitting through the
whole thing proved to be an effort.
Ciara Phillips, the only artist not to
do a video piece, offered up a room
plastered from floor to ceiling in
overlapping prints, repeating images
like frames from a film reel. Overlaid
onto this were bold, strong colours,
attempting to inject some vitality
into an exhibit that left little effect.
I left the exhibition without
the feeling in my gut that follows
profound and perspective altering
shows, just a strange hollowness.
Yes, some of the works touched on
interesting topics, like Campbell’s
work exploring how objective truth
can be manipulated in media so that
even our eyes deceive us. But I just
don’t feel video art in the way it was
presented did it any favours. I wasn’t
the only one who felt that way, as the
comments on the board outside the
exit showed (although in slightly less
measured words).
My advice to anyone considering
going: don’t. It’s not worth your time.
I’m going to be generous and say
that this is not the best of what some
of these artists have to offer and, at
£11, it is simply not worth it for a
competition that is looking more and
more irrelevant as time goes on. Go
instead to the Late Turner exhibition
downstairs, which provides you with
a completely new perspective on the
great artist. Who will be the winner of
this year’s £25,000 prize, announced
in December? For me at least, none
of the artists emerges as an obvious
frontrunner.
