The Imperial Falcons Softball
team was looking to improve
on their dismal last place
showing at the 2014 National
University Softball Championships
(NUSC) Spring Cup. Drawing on
8 players from the baseball and 5
new female members of the club,
the team look set to get the one win
they needed to improve their dismal
softball track record.
The first game proved to be a
setback however, with the Falcons
falling to the Nottingham Swingers
A team. The Falcons took the field
first, but a walk saw the Swingers’
leadoff man get on base, which would
prove detrimental as he eventually
came home on a sacrifice fly by their
fourth batter before the Falcons
closed out the inning with a strikeout.
The bottom of the inning proved a
quiet affair for the Falcons despite
a hit from leadoff Eduardo as they
went quietly without scoring a run.
The Falcons then had a disastrous
top inning in the second, giving up
a mercy rule 5 runs despite no hits
coming from the Swingers. In the
bottom, the Falcons sought to get
back in the game with leadoff Yuki
getting a single before a combination
of errors and walks drawn by Carole
and Jacques saw the Falcons hit back
with a mercy rule inning of their own
with runs scored by Yuki, Carole,
Rhys and Jacques and Eduardo. The
final inning saw the Falcons give up a
further 3 runs while giving up a 1-2-3
inning at bat. Taking a 1 run penalty
per inning for not having enough
girls, the Falcons saw their hopes
getting that coveted first softball win
delayed further with the 12-5 loss to
the Swingers.
Despite the loss, team morale
remained high and the Falcons
kept their hopes alive with an
invigorating performance against
the Loughborough Thunder B
team. This time, the Falcons were
the benefactors of the penalty rule,
having 4 girls on the field against
the 3 in the Thunder’s team. Again,
having won the toss, the Falcons
took the field first. With renewed
vigor, the fielding side put up a
strong performance off the back of
some strong pitching and a stellar
fielding performance which included
a remarkable diving stop from
third baseman Stephane. Despite
the performance, the Falcons gave
up 2 runs on 2 hits before getting
out of the inning with 2 strikeouts.
Now down by 2 runs, the Falcons
came back with a vengeance with the
first four batters from Eduardo to
Esther all drawing walks before Yuki
grounded into a fielder’s choice with
Anqi out at home on the forced play.
Carole then drew another walk to
bring in another run before Zack hit
in two runs with a line drive single.
Despite Catherine’s strike out, third
baseman Stephane drew the walk
needed to end the inning on the
mercy rule.
Leads come and go quickly in
slowpitch softball and the Falcons
knew that they’d need to be on their
toes to protect their lead. Heading
into the top of the second, pitcher
Ashley finally found his groove and
had an almost perfect inning with
2 strikeouts, 1 walk and an infield
pop fly that came right back to
him. Having held their opponents
scoreless, the Falcons came out again
looking to do some damage and they
got just that with another mercy rule
inning coming off 1 hit from Yuki,
helped along by 2 errors and 3 walks
drawn by Alex, Carole and Catherine.
With an unassailable 8 run lead, the
Falcons headed into the final inning
to close out the game. The first out
came easy enough with an infield
fly ball caught by third baseman
Stephane. However, after that, things
started to unravel as pitcher Ashley
committed a throwing error to first
followed by 2 hits and 2 walks which
saw the Thunder put 4 on the board
before the Falcons finally managed
to get out of the jam with 2 fly balls
to centerfield Yuki and shortstop
Eduardo respectively. Having the
home field advantage, the Falcons
didn’t need to bat again and closed
the game out 16-9 after penalties.
Buoyed by their first ever softball
win, Falcons morale was riding high
as they went into the final group
stage game against their baseball
arch rivals, the UEA Blue Sox. Again
winning the toss, the Falcons took
the field first and managed to see out
UEA for a single run off the back of
some strong pitching and fielding.
The Falcons then came racing out of
the gates at bat with 4 runs scoring
off 3 hits from Eduardo, Ashley and
Yuki, as well as 3 walks drawn by
Christina, Zack and Catherine. The
next inning however, saw the Blue
Sox getting back in the game off a
pitching meltdown from the Falcons
as pitcher Ashley gave 4 walks to
allow the Blue Sox a mercy rule
inning to regain the lead. Thankfully,
their lead was short-lived as the
Falcons rallied to save the game at
batting with a mercy rule inning of
their own off a hit from Eduardo, 2
errors and 4 walks drawn by Anqi,
Ashley, Yuki and Christina.
Back on top, the Falcons found
renewed strength despite giving up
an inside-the-park home run to the
Blue Sox’s leadoff man. The next 3
outs came in quick succession and
the Falcons closed the inning out for
1 run, bringing the score to 10-9 to
UEA after adding penalty runs. The
Falcons now needed 2 runs to walk
off the game and the mood was tense
as ninth batter Vincent stepped up to
the plate to lead off. Unfortunately,
the final inning would prove to be an
anticlimactic one as the Blue Sox gave
up 4 walks in succession to give up
the win off a “walk-off walk” to third
batter Ashley.
On the strength of their 2-1 win
loss record and 31 conceded runs
(after penalties), the Falcons set
another club record by making it
to their first ever slowpitch softball
semi-final against the top seeds from
the University of Portsmouth. The
Falcons started off strongly to get
1 run off hits from Eduardo and
Christina, helped along by 3 walks
drawn by Anqi, Ashley and Esther.
As the Falcons came on the field, a
strong errorless fielding performance
saw them holding the top of the
Portsmouth order scoreless to close
out the inning. The next inning
however, saw Falcon bats shut out
and the Portsmouth team started
to show their top seed credentials as
some excellent fielding kept Falcon
bats at bay while they scored 4 runs
off 4 hits. As the next inning came
round, the Falcons managed to put
one more run on the board courtesy
of a triple from Yuki which scored
Esther but it was too little too late,
and the Portsmouth team closed
the game our 9-2 with penalty runs
added.
The Falcons then played the third
and fourth placing playoff game
against the Loughborough A team
which started a very tight affair,
with both teams shutting out the
top of each other’s order in the first
inning before a series of 5 hits from
the bottom of the Loughborough
order brought in 4 runs in the top
of the second inning. With things
looking grim, the tired Falcon squad
could not mount a return salvo and
Loughborough A team shut out the
Falcons to end the inning. Despite
shutting out their opponents again
in the top of the third, the bottom of
the third would see the Falcons fail
in their comeback attempt as their
opponents shut them out again to
close out the game 7-0 winners after
adding penalty runs.
Despite their losses in the last two
games by 7 run margins, the Falcons
take great heart in their performance,
having gained their first 2 slowpitch
softball wins and made their first ever
NUSC semi-final appearance. The
Falcons will be looking to train hard
over the winter and come back even
stronger when the Spring tournament
season comes around in March.
Rugby 1st XV hold out for crucial victory over Reading
Imperial kicked off the season
against newly relegated Reading
at Harlington in what could be
an early promotion clash.Off
the back of a good pre-season,
and with a new coach,IC were
optimistic about the season ahead.
Fortunately,there was a break
from the recent bad weather,
which allowed a good fast game of
rugby.
A new look Imperial (five full
1st team debuts plus one off
the bench) were quick off the
line and won an early penalty in
the ruck,allowing captain Cox
to put the first points on the
board for the season.There was
some neat work under the high
ball from fresher Toby Simpson
and newly converted No.8 Joe
Bowden.However,a lack of match
sharpness was evident in some of
the initial exchanges,with a few
Imperial handling errors amongst
the good work,leading to a couple
of soft tries for Reading.
IC grew back into the game in
traditional style with a powerful
maul off the line out,leading to
yet another try for David Nielsen-
Scott in the corner.A missed
conversion from Cox brought the
score to 12-8 in favour of the away
side.A tough period in the game
followed,where no side gave a
yard,with big hits coming in left,
right and centre.Another huge
maul marched the visitors fifty
metres down the pitch,leading to
an IC penalty and a sin-binning for
Reading.Imperial continued to
turn the screw,and set up another
couple of penalties for Cox to take
us into half time with a narrow
lead.
The second half carried where
the first left off.The new look
front row of Adam‘Motley Crew’
Postlewaite and fresher Nathan
Tomlinson combined well with
club veteran Tom Hobson to
destroy a Reading scrum.More
imperial pressure gave Postlewaite
the chance to burrow over the line,
and Cox duly added the extras.
Quick ball was regularly on offer
and this allowed Rigsoc co-founder
Sam Moorby and Chris Macbeth
to make good yards through
midfield.Macbeth danced through
a number of tackles and was pulled
up just short of the Reading line,
but partner in crime Moorby was
on hand to finish off.More big hits
came in,one in particular leaving
Bowden seeing stars,eventually
leading to him being replaced by
Ruaridh Mckay,who slotted in
easily and found time to have the
Reading scrum half rear Rangered.
England international Billy
Twelvetrees also came on for his
debut at full back.
Just as IC seemed set to ease to
victory,our other,less-famous,
international Olisa Ufodiama
spoilt an otherwise impressive
performance and decided he
fancied the last ten minutes of
the game off for a rest in the
sin bin.Hopefully the 700 press
up punishment afterwards will
be a sufficient deterrent in the
future.Reading managed to get
a converted try to bring the score
back to 26-22,and set up a nervy
final five minutes.Everyone dug
in deep,and,with the assistance
of Luke Armatige's cider wielding
army on the sideline,IC held on for
a big win.
