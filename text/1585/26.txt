An Imperfect Reflection Of Our Modern Society
To say that J. G. Ballard was
only a writer is to do him a
disservice. The late British
modernist, whose oeuvre included
novels, essays, and short fiction, was
more of a prophet than an author:
seemingly predicting the brutal
modernisation that would descend
upon the UK during the second half
of the 20th Century, as well as the
accompanying social stagnation it
would bring. Ballard has the honor
of having his name as an adjective:
Ballardian, which Collins English
Dictionary describes as “dystopian
modernity, bleak man-made
landscapes, and the psychological
effects of technological progress”.
You could easily be forgiven if
you think this sounds familiar.
With the advent of social media,
online communication, and mass
media, society has moved into
an unprecedented age: post-post-
modern and more futuristic than
the future, the world we now inhabit
has been cleft in half: we have
the ‘true reality’, and the virtual
‘mirrorworld’. At least, this is what
the Hayward Gallery hopes to
prove with the opening of its latest
exhibition MIRRORCITY. Taking
on innumerable big themes – reality,
narrative, physical spaces, illusions,
social mobility, capitalism, and more
– MIRRORCITY is an exhibition
that aims high, but never quite
delivers such lofty heights, creating
an experience that is beguiling,
sometimes uplifting, but ultimately
frustrating.
Upon entering the bleak cement
exhibition space, we are confronted
with the vast upturned hull of a ship.
Its figurehead lies, pathetic, on the
floor: a young woman whose face is
shrouded, entangled in the arms of
a sea monster. This is the work of
Lindsay Seers, whose installation
confronts the disconnect between
myth and reality. Drawing on the
personal story of her great-great-
uncle – a sailor – Seers uses film and
sound to subtly make the viewer
question the world around them.
This theme of artifice is further
expounded upon by Turner Prize
winner Laure Prouvost, whose
work The Artist comprises of a pre-
arranged ‘studio’, purportedly that
of her conceptual artist grandfather.
Squeezing into this cramped space
under the beady eye of a security
guard, one is immediately assaulted,
both visually and audibly: every nook
and cranny of the room is filled up
with clutter, tools, and ephemera,
through which Provost reconstructs
the legend of her grandfather. Video
installations play throughout the
room, while looped soundtracks filter
in and out of the space. Urging you
to ‘Look here!’ and ‘Look over there!’,
they combine to create an unsettling
experience.
Another narrative is constructed
by Ursula Mayer: taking inspiration
from Euripides’ Greek tragedy Medea,
she casts LGBT activist JD Samson
as both Medea and Jason, creating a
‘post-gender speculation’. A vision
of a future where social structures
have been broken down, it is at once
both inspiring and dystopian. Set
predominantly among valleys and
deserts, the collage of text, sound,
and film is like a Middle Eastern
version of Derek Jarman’s The Last of
England.
Elsewhere, artists explore the
meaning of different media and
materials. John Stezaker’s work
is excellent as usual, with his
repurposed film stills, clipped and

Fred Fyles takes a glance at the new MIRRORCITY exhibition
"The
exhibtion is
beguiling,
uplifting,
but
ultimately
frustrating"
"John
Stezaker's
work is
excellent,
creating a
new visual
language"
pasted together, creating a new
visual language. Less effective are
Daniel Sinsel’s canvases: aiming to
deconstruct the relationship between
materials and the feelings they evoke,
Sinsel uses extreme juxtaposition
to bring out their qualities, but
ultimately lacks emotional force.
Helen Marten attempts to do
something similar with her rag-tag
collection of curios, assembled as
if by a magpie. Sadly, randomly
throwing together disparate objects
does not effective art make – perhaps
she should leave it to the actual birds.
The promised exploration of
capitalism is fulfilled by Tim
Etchells; his fantasy headlines,
printed on large sheets, satirise the
news of today. Dryer than a gin
martini, and packing twice the punch,
they take on all manner of topics,
from CCTV to gang culture (Sample
headline: Tonight’s Presentation: Black
Hole – No Intermission). In terms
of understanding modern culture,
Etchells is way above any other
artists in the exhibition; if Private
Eye is looking for a new contributor,
perhaps they should give him a call.
Pil & Galia Kollektiv continue
in this vein, with their sculpture
Concrete Gown for Immaterial Flows
taking its name from a Zionist paean
to cement. Inspired by capitalism, it
is a stage constructed out of concrete
blocks which form bar graphs and
pie charts, while behind a red arrow
crashes towards the earth. The
work subverts the argument that
capitalism is a natural extension
of evolution, instead revealing it
as something artificial, manmade,
and callous. While the work is quite
clever, some of the points the artists
are trying to make can at times feel
like a bit of a stretch – you’re more
likely to see this piece on Top of the
Pops than at an Occupy rally.
A highlight of the exhibition is
Katrina Palmer, whose emotive
soundscape Reality Flickers is
housed in an empty locker, a space
that “contains nothing but its own
absence”. A voiceover that describes
the story of Miss Ficker, a naive
collector of tossed objects, defined by
the fact that they are ‘lost rather than
found’, who meets the Heart Beast.
Underscored by a subtle, melancholic
piano score & unintelligible voices
which mutter and stutter, Palmer
has created an oasis of solitude and
isolation within the middle of the
gallery.
The remainder of the exhibition
– and trust me, it is extensive – is by
and large uninspiring. There’s Anne
Mardy, whose constructed spaces
are as bland as the cement blocks
inhabiting them; Michael Dean’s
sculptures, which are dull both in
form and name; and Mohammed
Qasim Ashfaq, whose work
simultaneously demands ‘viewer
engagement’ (his words, not mine)
and manages to be monumentally
insipid. Some work comes from a
clear germ of inspiration, such as
Susan Hiller’s collage of space sounds
and frequencies, but ultimately fails
to say anything of importance.
We have seen in the past few years
that the Hayward Gallery is able to
put on first class exhibitions which
take on a wide range of themes.
However, MIRRORCITY is a step too
far; by trying to cover all the bases
it stretches itself too thin, until you
can see through the veneer of the
majority of the works to find the
unimaginative premise underneath.
Like many visions of the future, it
promises wealth and riches, but at
best delivers malaise and ennui; in
that respect, at least, Ballard would
be proud.
