Barcelona, a city so vibrant
with culture that I just had to
add it to one of my favourite
cities in the world. However, this
capital would be significantly
different without the works of
Modernist Antoni Gaudí – the man
who gave creativity a whole new
definition. Gaudí contributed seven
exceptionally beautiful buildings to
the Spanish architectural history. You
must be wondering, out of seven, why
did I choose Casa Batlló?
Casa Batlló was previously an
ordinary piece of property before it
was bought by textile businessman
Josep Batlló. It was then remodeled
and redesigned by Gaudí between
1904 and 1906 and to this date, still
reflects the existence of imaginative
architecture. It stands out due to the
innovation of concepts employed and
the methodology used. The building
consists of a ground floor, a main
floor with a courtyard, four further
self-contained floors, a loft and a
rooftop terrace. Once you enter the
building, be ready to be blown away as
you’ll be greeted by a grand wooden
staircase, which leads to the Noble
Floor, where the Batlló family used to
call home.
As one slowly walks up, they’ll
be instantly entranced by the
different hues of blue coupled with
skylights shaped like tortoise shells,
transporting you to the underwater
nature reminiscent of Finding
Nemo. Gaudí stood true to his word,
engaging the close relationship
between colours and light. As a
result, the building well was created.
It was the most crucial part of the
refurbishment as it allows light to
enter. To complement this idea, the
interior walls are covered in varying
shades of blue, arranged from a
darker hue at the top grading to
lighter at the bottom. The windows
get progressively bigger as you
move from the top to the bottom
of the house. This further testified
Gaudí’s ingenuity by incorporating
natural light in his work. Wooden
slits are added below the windows to
maximize the functionality of the
house by ensuring good ventilation.
The roof resembles a dragon’s
back and is decorated with four
chimneystacks. The chimneys are
carefully designed with caps to
prevent the obstruction of smoke
escape by the wind. As one moves
through the house, they would be
constantly surprised by the tiniest
elements displayed. The abundance
of creativity is shown from the
different colours of tiles used.
I thoroughly enjoyed my time at
Casa Batlló because for someone who
isn’t too crazy about art, it is pleasant
to look at, intriguing enough to muse
on after, and the best of all, nothing
short of a remarkable experience that
catches one off guard at every turn.
For €20, you get an unforgettable
tour around the house at your own
pace. The ticket price is also inclusive
of an audio guide, which describes
in most languages the perfection in
every detail. There is always a huge
crowd of tourists on most days; one
should thus book their tickets online
to avoid disappointment. From a
student’s perspective, admission
tickets can slightly be on the high
side, however I can assure you it is
worth every single penny.
Casa Batlló, a unique residence so
laboriously designed and executed
that it left me in awe for the rest of
my trip.
Having spent a month in
Zakynthos as a volunteer, I
had come to the conclusion
that the best way to navigate and
enjoy this wonderful Greek island is
by renting a car and sailing along its
coasts. While I only travelled across
a small part of the island, here are
two highlights that I would highly
recommend both driving and sailing
through.
Shipwreck Bay
Whilst the mystical, almost milky
turquoise water alone provides
enough incentive to visit this
sea-access only beach, the wreck of
Panagiotis washed ashore during
1983 has made it one of the most
famous and photographed locations
in the world.
The iconic views of this cove are
from the headline accessible by roads,
though the sign to it is obscurely
written on the ground before a sharp
U-turn. Up there are many souvenir
stalls selling local delicacies such as
spiced wine, honey and olive oil to
tourists. On the edge is an observation
platform, but if you are determined
to get the best angle, walk all the way
out along the headland to the right
for that perfect shot.
For those who want to go to the
beach, boat trips are bookable at
numerous locations in town (as are
jeep tours for those who don’t want
to drive) and usually involve a stop
by the famous Blue Caves. Costing
around €25, it lasts about five hours
and if you only want that photo of the
wreck on the beach, there are plenty
other beaches you can relax on with
less effort, as the ship up close is only
a graffitied metal mess, and if the
waves are strong on the day you will
have to swim to shore, leaving your
belongings on board.
Porto Limnionas Bay
With no tours or public transport
link, this gorgeous bay along the
west coast of the Island is a secret
sanctuary from the main tourist sites.
Upon arrival at the car park you will
be dazzled by the sapphire water
nestling between the tall white cliffs
either side. While it has no beach, the
tavern at the top has sun-loungers for
rent set up along the platforms next
to the natural limestone steps leading
down to the water.
Boasting numerous caves and
crystal clear water, it is the perfect
place to snorkel and explore. The
water is refreshingly cool and rather
salty, with little to no waves to trouble
your swim. For the adventurous kind,
Bursting with activities, the
broadway market is more
of a meeting place than a
market. Photo: Yung Nam

there is a concrete surface midway up,
to the left of the stairs, for daredevils
to leap into the lagoon, or for those
who are merely looking for a better
place to work on their tan. For those
who are more safety cautions, you can
dive from or sit down by the lagoon
on the small concrete platform at
the bottom of the slope – though be
warned: it is very slippery!
