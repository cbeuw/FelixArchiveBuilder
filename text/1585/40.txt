Imperial duo represent Britain in Triathlon
After 24 hours of travel and
quite a few more hours spent
training, I finally arrived
in Edmonton, Canada for the 2014
World Triathlon Series and Age-
Groupers’ World Championship.
Feeling not so jet-fresh due to a
delayed arrival, I met the Team GB
age-groupers for the bike course
familiarization at 8 am the morning
of my arrival, having built my bike
in a record 10 minutes. The sense of
team pride was clearly displayed as a
peloton of over 100 riders took to the
streets of Edmonton, with motorists
enthusiastically waving and letting us
through.
The following day was pre-race
day; to me, this means doing bare
minimum. We headed over to
the race village for a swim in the
chlorinated lake (don’t even get
me started). The water, I must
frustratingly admit, was nearly
perfect to swim in with all the various
chemical additions, and was wet-suit
temperature. This meant that luckily,
I had my buoyancy aid for the swim.
After racking bikes the compulsory
24 hours in advance, we headed back
for the welcoming parade of nations.
This included a fly-by by Edmonton’s
air force, and a speech from the
coolest mayor ever, Don. Every time
the sun came out, the fear of bike
tyres bursting due to the increased
pressure played on everyone’s mind.
Finally, it was time for the pasta meal
and then off to bed in time to wake
up for the relatively relaxed start of
5.30 am.
Arriving at the venue on race day,
I was pleased that not only had my
tyres survived the heat, but also the
conditions were perfect for a race.
There was no rain - so less likelihood
of slipping off the bike, something I
seem to be quite prone to doing.
After The usual warm-up, I joined
the rest of my 9.41am female 20-24
wave in the race village. Nerves were
high as we were led out to the starting
pen by a bag-piper-who’s relevance
is still very mysterious. At 9.30, the
first and youngest wave was finally
off. As we took to the start line, the
first of these younger athletes were
already coming out of the water.
Finally, the horn hooted and we were
off. I seemed to somehow manage
an amazing dive off the beach start
and started with a body’s length lead
on everyone else. But this was short
lived, and at the first buoy, I was
overtaken by the fastest swimmers,
and into the heart of the brawl. On
every stroke I was being dunked
and struggling for breath, and never
managed to properly find a rhythm
or do any good sighting, to the point
By this point, I had caught up with
some of the girls in the age group
below, giving a burst of adrenaline
with each overtake. I gave the rest of
the run my all, and just managed to
hold myself up after a sprint finish
past the grandstand. Everyone from
all countries present was cheering so
loudly I couldn’t distinguish a single
word. The atmosphere was crazy. I
was greeted by Hannah Johnston, a
fellow GB team-mate who’d come
2nd in the race, who informed me I’d
come third. I couldn’t believe it and
didn’t believe it until the results were
pinned up.
And there I was, third! A podium
place! I’d manage to avoid all bike
mechanical failures and falls (a
triathlete’s worst nightmare), survive
being consistently dunked and finish
third in the world Champs in my first
year of triathlon. Not only that but
we were soon to learn that Laura-
Ann, fellow Imperial competitor had
finished top GB, and 13th overall in
an extremely competitive age group.
This also means that both McGill
and Simmonds were amongst the few
to pre-qualify for the 2015 Geneva
European champs 2015, as well as the
Chicago World Championships later
in the year.
Further qualifying races are taking
place in early 2015, and we strongly
recommend you give it a go as the
racing and experience of representing
your country is like no other.
The weekend was followed by a
lot of triathlon watching, although
limited triathlon doing, as the Elite
women’s and Men’s and U23 races
were taking place. We got to witness
Gwen Jorgensen’s inspiring run and
Alistair Brownlee’s phenomenal win
in the WTS final.
Thank you firstly to Laura-Ann
McGill, my tri-mum without
whom I would never have even
thought it possible to trial for, let
alone represent GB. Also, thanks
to Mum and Jethro, for coming
and supporting and being dragged
around triathlons without (well
minimal) complaint. Finally th ank
you to Sport Imperial and Team GB
organisers for helping me get there.

where I undershot the swim exit and
had to veer round 90° to get to the
blue exit carpet.
Out of the swim, my loyal
supporters (mother and brother)
informed me that I was in 9th
position, much higher than I ever
come in the weakest of the three
disciplines. I ran towards transition
(and may have dropped my hat
and goggles which I go back for to
avoid a 15 second penalty), and into
transition area. Here I whip off my
wetsuit and onto the bike as fast as
possible. The bike course started with
a hill. As I was struggling to breathe,
I took this one to try to settle into
the bike, and managed to overtake
a couple of my opponents on the
way up. The rest of the bike course
was flat, albeit windy, and I was glad
my trusted Scott was not blessed
with rims or a disk wheel, as this
would undoubtedly have led to being
thrown across the highly ventilated
bridge.
After 2 laps and no falls, it was off
the bike and into T2. As I began the
run, I realised just how hard I had
pushed on the bike as I felt the initial
signs of cramping in my calves. As
instructed in my first race this year,
I took the advice of James Ellis and
“took the first 500 gently”. After
surviving this, I knew the likelihood
of cramp was slim, so I went for it
then, running as hard as I could.
