HELIX: A Marriage of Design and Health
This week, I had the opportunity
to visit The HELIX Centre
for Design in Healthcare,
part of Imperial’s Institute of Global
Health Innovation. Based at St.
Mary's Hospital in Paddington, the
centre aims to provide solutions
in healthcare through intelligent
and low cost design. Formed less
than a year ago as a collaboration
between the Royal College of Art
and Imperial College, London; I was
really enthusiastic about this, both as
a medic and someone interested in
clever and elegant design. It promised
to be an exciting integration of fields
not often thought of together. I sat
down with Maja Kecman, a specialist
in healthcare design working at
HELIX, to see if the hype was
justified:
Kamil: So can you tell me a little
bit about what you do at HELIX?
Maja: HELIX stands for Healthcare
Innovation Exchange so it is all about
the sharing of ideas and know-how
between doctors, researchers and
designers to create products that
have a real impact on healthcare
and disease management. We’re
really privileged to be based here in
St. Mary’s Hospital because we can
very easily test our prototypes in a
clinical setting and see what could
be improved. Also, being at the top
trauma centre in London means
that we have access to expertise that
wouldn’t be available elsewhere. It’s a
great place to be!
K: And so, how is an idea usually
thought of? Are you approached by
people working in the healthcare
environment or do you yourselves
spend time on the wards or in
clinics looking for things that
could be improved on?
M: It’s a bit of a mixture of both.
Because we’re quite young as a
centre, we have only quite recently
started offering consultations to
outside people. Otherwise, it’s mostly
either spending time in healthcare
environments or just looking at
disease statistics to see what the big
problems are and working from there.
For example, back in 2009 as part of
the RCA’s Helen Hamlyn Centre
for Design, my colleague Gianpaolo
Fusari spent time with paramedics to
look into problems with the current
design of ambulances. This helped
him learn about issues such as the
poor layout of storage spaces and the
difficulty cleaning the back of the
vehicle and led to an award-winning
redesign of UK ambulances. Another
example is our Asthma Project where
I started with the statistics that 75%
of asthma hospital admissions and
90%of deaths are preventable. As
you can see, these are pretty shocking
numbers so I did some research into
that and came up with a simple app
for children to help with compliance
and monitoring of the disease.
K: Could you tell me a bit more
about this asthma app?
M: So I started out with this statistic
and then basically needed to
search for a cause. After spending
time in an asthma clinic at Royal
Brompton Hospital and talking
to some specialists in asthma, it
seemed like a major factor in these
statistics is the incorrect use of the
inhaler. Of course, this could have
meant redesigning the inhaler but
that would have meant having to
change too much. So instead, we
came up with an app that would
help kids measure lung function as
well as monitoring the management
of their condition over time. It’s
simple, cheap and easy to use and
preliminary studies in patients seem
to suggest it is effective and quite
popular.
K: Is making cheap ideas quite
central to HELIX's practice then?
M: Absolutely! Frugality is one our
central principles. It makes our
ideas more easily implementable
and realistic so they don’t just stay
as research but actually become a
product. Also, from more of a global
Kamil McClelland speaks to Maja Kecman, a specialist in medical design
at the HELIX Centre
health perspective, it means that we
can roll it out to developing countries
who would otherwise not be able to
afford it. So going back to this app, we
are hoping to expand it to India, with
the help of one of our international
collaborators there. This will mean
testing it on 200 children and really
seeing whether it can effectively
be rolled out on a wide scale and in
settings and cultures different to the
UK.
K: Have you done any other
international work in settings
outside the NHS?
M: Not yet, but it’s certainly an area
that we want to expand in the future.
At the moment, we’ve just been
working inside the British system
because this is where we are based and
what we know. But, by making our
designs cheap, simple and scalable,
we hope this will make them more
feasible business models that can be
expanded abroad more easily. And
I think that is what sets us apart
from other research centres looking
at healthcare design: we want to, at
the end of the day, create an actual
marketable product as opposed to
just a research project that never goes
beyond the early stages.
This means we think a lot about
how to make our ideas implementa-
ble and we also work closely with
business people to advance our
designs into viable creations.
It’s probably best to think of us as a
collection of healthcare design start-
ups with the unique benefit of being
closely linked to a hospital.
"We have
access to
expertise
that
wouldn't be
available
anywhere
else"
"Most
people at
the RCA
actually
have a
background
in
engineering"
K: And how has it been working on
healthcare design as someone who
trained at RCA? Does it have some
unique challenges that you weren't
expecting?
M: First of all, a common
misconception about the RCA is that
it is all fine art. Around 80% is design
and in fact everyone here has some
kind of background in engineering or
industrial design. In terms of working
in healthcare, I’ve been working in
the field for the past ten years but it
certainly does have its own problems.
There’s a lot of bureaucracy and
regulation and this makes progress
difficult. Being embedded in the
hospital does help on this front as this
streamlines the process somewhat.
This is one of the reasons we don’t
deal with surgical instruments.
Another problem with hospitals is
that, because of their organisation,
it’s really difficult to bring in
widespread change. They aren’t
like a supermarket chain where
each individual shop has the same
format so changes can very easily
be implemented across the board. A
hospital’s more like a collection of
little corner shops, each one slightly
different, each with a different
managerial structure that needs to be
approached separately. This is what
wards are like let alone hospitals,
trusts and the NHS as a whole so you
can imagine some of the problems
faced when trying to bring change.
K: Finally, I wanted to ask you a
little bit about the future and what
you think it holds for HELIX.
You talked briefly about wanting
a greater international focus to
HELIX, are there any other plans
you have for the centre?
M: That’s definitely a key part of
what we want to be doing as we go
forward. If you look at the Mayo
Clinic's Center for Innovation in
the US, they do a similar thing to us
but mostly focus on creating designs
for their own clinic so I feel being part
of IGHI with its global perspective
means we are doing something new.
When I visited there five years ago,
they were as small as we are currently
but now employ around 30 designers.
So I’m optimistic for the future! Also,
as we roll out our products and earn
some money, we’re hoping to become
more financially self-sufficient so we
don’t have to rely on outside funding.
I think this will be a key step for us
and hopefully help drive even more
design innovation. So it’s an exciting
time at the moment in the centre
with a lot of change ahead!
