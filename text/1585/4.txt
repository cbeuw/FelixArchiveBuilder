The summer months were spent
catching up with friends back
home, travelling, earning
money to blow on rent and, for
some, geological mapping. Mixed in
with this, the Royal School of Mines
committee had carefully planned
their start of term activities leading
up to the big one: Fresher’s Dinner.
On 17th
October, 178 people
attended the annual dinner at The
Rembrandt Hotel, 91 of them freshers
from the Materials and Earth Science
departments; this reflects the high
demand for the social events that the
RSM provides for its members.
All the first years, accompanied
by their older undergraduate hosts,
marched along Exhibition Road
looking rather dapper and not too
out of place out and about in South
Kensington. Upon arrival at The
Rembrandt they were greeted by an
array of black and gold decorations,
and empty helium tanks that
definitely weren’t inhaled by Vice-
President James Cox. President Ben
Warnick started proceedings with
an impressive welcoming speech,
including a hysterical poem read
from the “RSM Bible”.
The three course meal went down a
treat with everyone, a different league
from those student budget meals your
uni friends cook and upload pictures
of onto Facebook in the hope of a few
“likes”. No, this was a formal three
course dinner from a five star hotel in
Kensington, food we at the RSM like
to savour for our big events: chicken
liver pâté with compote, cod fillet
with creamy chive sauce, ratatouille
and potato rosti cake to name a few.
Also in attendance were two guest
speakers: Dr Martyn McLachlan from
Materials and Dr Matt Genge from
the Earth Science department. Both
are popular lecturers among students
in their respective departments,
and quickly became the centre of
attention with eye-catching and
funny speeches to the audience.
One highlight of the evening
included third year geologist
Matt Irwin, who took centre stage,
declaring that his table would like to
raise a toast to the President and his
committee for organising the event.
Then all five hosts and five freshers at
the table stood up, and literally “raised
a toast” by holding aloft slices of toast
to the committee table. Their pockets
may have been filled with burnt
crumbs, but the gag was successfully
pulled off. Well played, boys.
After the closing speeches – as is
standard – the Scottish contingent of
RSM spontaneously burst into song
as “Flower Of Scotland” rang through
the room. This was not planned, and
was not prompted for any reason,
but it did not stop Dr McLachlan
RSM Dinner caps off a successful
fortnight
Matthew Pike talks about what the Miners got up to last Friday
joining in and taking lead. The RSM,
still looking stylish in their formal
wear, proceeded to head back through
South Kensington for a post-dinner
gathering at the Union, which
included discussions along the lines
of “what a jolly good dinner that was”.
It was the first time that the
Ambulances arrive at the
Union after RSM dinner
Two ambulances were called to
Beit Quad last Friday night to
collect two students who had
been drinking in the union bars. The
students in question, two girls, had
previously been to the Royal School
of Mines (RSM) Freshers’ dinner,
although the reasons the ambulances
were called were unrelated to alcohol
consumption.
The ambulances arrived shortly
after midnight. The first came to
collect a student who had passed
out due to a pre-existing medical
condition, whilst the other took a
student who had sliced open her foot.
Both students have subsequently
made a full recovery.
The dinner was held at The
Rembrandt Hotel in Kensington, and
was attended by 178 people, around
half of whom were first year students.
In previous years, the dinner has been
held in Queen’s Tower Rooms, and
traditionally people move on to the
Union for after dinner drinks.
We spoke to Ben Warnick, RSM
President for 2014/15, who was also
present at the dinner. “After the end
of the official RSMU Freshers’ dinner
on Friday some people chose to go
back to the union due to its proximity
to the hotel. All were sufficiently
sober to be let in by the bouncers. All
of the appropriate welfare measures
were taken to ensure the wellbeing of
the people involved.”
Deputy President (Welfare), Chris
Kaye, was also present that evening.
Said Chris, “I arrived at the Union just
before midnight and an ambulance
was pulling up outside. A student had
collapsed with what I believe to be an
underlying medical condition.
“Shortly afterwards, another
ambulance turned up for someone
who had fallen and injured
themselves. I made sure to stay
around with Ben until it was
confirmed that the students were in
safe hands.”

those who attended and even hotel
staff.
A big shout out goes to Vice-
President Tor Tennant and Ball
Officers Abbie Trice and Bethan Clark
for organising the event.

A Powerful man moves from the Union
to the Blue Cube
Dr Philip Power is finally
leaving the Union after 16
years of involvement at
Imperial College London, first as an
undergraduate, then a postgraduate
and finally as a member of staff for
Imperial College Union.
During his time as a student at
Imperial, first in the Department
of Mathematics and then as a PhD
student in the Department of Earth
Science he was heavily involved
with the Union, including being on
the Recreational Clubs Committee,
of which he was the Chair for three
years, from September 2002 to June
2005.
After completing his PhD in 2005,
he then joined the Union Staff where
he became the Membership Services
Manager, dealing with many of the
major Clubs, Societies and Projects

matters including life and associate
memberships and tankards, among
other things. The last of these lead to
him recieiving the title of Tankard
Baron.
However Dr Power is not leaving
the Imperial Bubble completely, as
he has found himself a new home
in “the Blue Cube” on the South
Kensington Campus, moving over
the road to become the new Faculty
Education Officer for the Faculty of
Engineering.
To celebrate the end of this long
period of work, the Union is hosting
a leaving party with a guest list that
boasts some of the biggest names
from Union history as well as current
staff and students, with the event
being described by some as “ the Party
of the season”.
Dr Power has been a highly
regarded member of Union staff,
making fine use of his considerable
knowledge of the Union and College
to enhance the student experience.
When asked whether the Union
staff would miss Phil Power, Felix was
told: “Our loss is College’s gain.”
