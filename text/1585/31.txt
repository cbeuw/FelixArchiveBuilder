Zakynthos - the lost paradise

Yung Nam Cheah’s tale of how being a popular clubbing destination has changed this island
With white sandy beaches,
crystal clear water,
magnificent white cliffs
and lustrous woodland, at first
glance, Zakynthos seems the picture
of paradise like the dozen other
beautiful Greek islands dotted
across the Ionian Sea. Famed for
the Laganas clubbing stripe, iconic
shipwreck of Navagio beach and the
sightings of Loggerhead sea turtles, it
has been a hotspot for youngsters all
over UK as well as divers and beach
lovers. However, most holiday seekers
flocking to this lost paradise rarely
take a moment to consider their
impact on the endangered turtles.
Zakynthos has been the main
nesting ground for the Mediterranean
Caretta Caretta species of sea turtles
for thousands of years. Mating in the
open ocean, the females then travel
up to thousands of miles throughout
the months of June and August to
the beach where they hatched to take
their turn to nest.
Laganas town of Zakynthos is the
famous beach and party destination,
with rolling sand dunes stretching
on for hundreds of meters attracting
thousands in the 80s. Now, however
it is completely gone and in its place
stands countless bars and pubs
leaving only a measly few meters
of compacted sand, effectively
destroying the breeding ground.
The same is happening all over West
Laganas Bay as more and more
tourists flock to the gorgeous beaches,
rendering only 6 of the 11.5km
stretch of beach usable for nesting.
The aftermath of this is reflected
in the dramatic drop of female
loggerheads returning to Zakynthos
to nest every year, and tourism
affects even those that still return.
Business such as turtle sighting
boat trips and night time beach
tours advertising for sightings of the
endangered species have sprouted
across touristic towns taking full
advantage of the visiting bloom.
“Why is this bad?” you might ask;
glass bottom boat tours are amongst
the most notorious in their ruthless
behavior to sea turtles. Boasting
a guarantee of a turtle sighting or
your money back, these companies
work in groups to locate and corner
loggerhead females in the bay. Often
they use propellers to stir up the
sand forcing them to swim to the
surface for the amusement of tourists
exhausting them. Then they will try
to get the turtles under the boat for
photographic views through the glass
bottom. There has been cases where
turtles are injured and left for death
after the boat has run it over. And
this is not the end of the story: boats
will come and go in turns to ship
the next batch of tourists to make
the most of it, caring little for the
stressed creature being chased and
cornered for what can last for hours.
As for night time tours, they try
to take advantage of the early hours
when females would emerge from
the sea and using their flappers, they
crawl slowly and strenuously to the
dry sand to nest. This is an extremely
difficult journey for a marine species
and any disturbance can easily scare
the creature into returning into
the sea as often occurs with tourists
oohing and awing over them. If
stressed enough, the turtles will lay
the egg in the ocean where they have
no chance of survival.
Even if the female successfully
nests, the odds are still stacked
against the eggs. With lazy sun
loungers, swaying palm leave
umbrellas, bars and even tractors
invading beaches across the island
compacting nests, suffocating or
barring the exit and often destroying
the eggs altogether. Even if the
hatchlings make it out after 60 days,
light and noise pollution from the
bars and pubs will disorient them and
many have ended up in the road and
have been hit by traffic.
There are plenty of beautiful
beaches apart from those in Laganas
Bay on the Island and I would
strongly urge you to avoid all nesting
beaches in an effort to conserve the
Loggerhead. However, if you are
determined to visit one, here’s a few
tips on how to be sea turtle friendly
tourists when you visit from May to
October.
Stay within 5 metres of the
waterline and do not venture into
softer sands where turtles lay their
eggs.
Nests are usually fenced off, make
sure you stay clear of it by at least two
meters
Stick to the opening time of the
beach, which is usually 7am-6pm
DO NOT under any condition
return at night to see the female
nesting or hatchlings, as this will only
disturb them
If you do see a turtle when
snorkeling, make sure you stay at
least 5 metres away and only follow
for five minutes – this is also for your
own safety as Loggerheads have a very
powerful jaw.
Dedicated to protecting and
educating the public on this is Earth,
Sea and Sky Global founded by
local Yannis Vardakastanis in 1993.
Sponsored by Sealife, they have built
a magnificent rescue center last year
on the Southeast corner of the Island
near the picturesque Gerakas beach.
The number of volunteers vary
depending on application and
during my month long stay I met
thirteen wonderful people from all
over the world. The center is run by
the founder Yannis who leads the
morning survey daily and Jonna who
is in charge of the volunteers. We
often have meals together after the
last shift at the adjoining restaurant
which gives us 50% off food.
As a volunteer during nesting
season, my typical shift involves early
morning surveys to count new nests
and relocate any that are in danger
of being crushed. You can identify
new nests by the fresh flapper tracks
on the sand leading to a small sand
mount. Although, it takes time to
get an eye for telling the difference
between a real and abandon nest
which is often less well covered.
Morning shifts involve opening
up and cleaning the center, feeding
the fishes and running the gift shop.
Educating and answering questions
from tourists are also important parts
of our job.
During the midday shift we do a
people count at Gerakas beach, which

is also a nesting ground for data
collection in tourism effect on the
Loggerhead.
Again we run the gift shop and at
15:30 we feed and check if there are
ticks on our resident tortoises in
their enclosure. They are very sneaky
and take some time to locate! Every
week we also feed Diamond the snake
on Friday and the Maury Eel on
Wednesday.
Evening shifts are quietest for the
shop and allow us the time to work on
any projects we initiated during our
stay. We are encouraged to suggest
changes to the information center
and in such a small organization,
your action creates a large impact.
During my month, I helped to paint a
sign to accompany the newly acquired
giant turtle Zantos greeting visitors at
the front as well as creating numerous
posters and translated leaflets for the
centre.
