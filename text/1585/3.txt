Imperial graduands flock to Royal
Albert Hall for graduation
It was Imperial’s favourite day
off this week, as graduands came
back to touch the Gast hand and
finally graduate completely. More
than 2200 undergraduates passed
through the Royal Albert Hall to
receive their degrees in three separate
ceremonies that took part during
Commemoration Day.
This was the first Commemoration
day for Imperial’s new President,
Professor Alice Gast, who told
students to “Take all that you have
learned and put it to work,” during
her speech.
“The demands of the world are
daunting. We need well-educated
leaders like you who can develop the
new approaches, the clever solutions
and the compelling ideas that will
guide us in the future.”
The ceremonies also included
the presentation of the Awards
for Outstanding Achievement,
which went to Caroline Wood
from the Department of Chemistry
(a former Felix editor) and
Alireza Tahmasebzadeh from the
Department of Bioengineering.
Medals for Outstanding
Contributions to Teaching Excellence
were presented to to Professor Mary
Morrell from Faculty of Medicine
and Dr William Knottenbelt from
the Department of Computing. Dr
John Gibbons from the Department
of Mathematics and Dr Rudiger
Woscholski from the Department of
Chemistry will both receive Medals
for Excellence in Pastoral Care.
Medals for Supporting the Student
Experience were presented to Dr
Maria Toro-Troconis, School of
Medicine, and Mr Ian Gillett from
the Safety Department.
But why is it called
Commemoration Day? The day
is named in honour of a visit to
Imperial by King George VI and
Queen Elizabeth in 1945, on the
centenary of the foundation of
the Royal College of Chemistry,
Imperial’s oldest forerunner.
Chris Kaye, Deputy President
(Welfare), said he was impressed when
they played God save the Queen,
although he said he got emotional
“due to a separate matter.” I know that this day happens every year, but for some reason it makes me all teary and proud. Photo: T. Lim
Universities have been told that
they shouldn’t view exam
results as “finalised” until the
end of October. OCR, a leading exam
results board, added to the statement
saying that all results “remain
provisional” until all re-marks are
complete. Re-marks aren’t fully
finished until the end of October,
which is a month after most degree
courses start.
Universities don’t want to wait
until October to make their final
decisions, which means that many
students could miss out on their
university places due to human error
in the marking of papers.
The news comes as it emerged
that more than 45,000 exam grades
were changed this year on appeal, an
increase of 15%on last year. It has
increased by as much as 50%on 2011.
The general secretary of the
Association of School and College
Leaders, Mr Lightman said he wasn’t
sure if the increases were as a result
of “fundamental weaknesses in
marking”, but did point out that there
is now a “lack of confidence in the
exam system”.
Richard Harman, who is the
Chairman of the Headmasters’ and
Headmistresses’ Conference said that
“The college or university places of
tens of thousands of students have
been needlessly jeopardised this
autumn and the exam boards must be
made to do much better.”
UCAS, who run the admissions
platform for most UK universities,
released a statement in which it said,
“We strongly advise students who
have requested a remark to contact
the university or college immediately
and explain their situation.
“Institutions guarantee students
who have requested a remark that
their offer remains open until 31
August.
“After this point universities will
make their best endeavours to keep a
place open for the student until the
process is resolved, or may provide
the option of deferred entry the
following year.”
