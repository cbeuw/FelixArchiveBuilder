Spirits high and voices out of tune for Medicals in Canada
Continued from page 24
the previous day or the man-
ner in which the second team
had played, the firsts left the
Irish literally shell-shocked,
scoring several tries. Mention
must be made of Underwood
and Thomas, who both col-
lected deserved hat-tricks.
The final score was 63-7 to
the medics.
This brought the squad’s
visit to Calgary to an end,
and they set off on the jour-
ney through the Rockies,
bound for Vancouver. White
water rafting afforded them
the opportunity to experi-
ence some fantastic scenery,
as well as typical Canadian
water temperatures. During
the drive they stayed over
at Banff and Kamloops, and
enjoyed the hospitality these
towns had to offer.
Vancouver is a city that
made a very good impression
on all the tourists, and most of
the party expressed interest
in medical posts there. After
a short break from rugby, the
Medicals were very keen to
get back into the playing fold.
There was also a feeling that
they now had a reputation
to defend, following the free-
scoring games in Calgary.
The small town of Langley
were the next opposition, a
fixture arranged for the first
XV only. The game was again
played in burning heat on a
hard pitch, and the Medicals
found themselves down by
a couple of tries early on.
However, the sensible, col-
lected attitude displayed so
many times last season shone
through, and the team went
on to score four tries and
control the game. The hard,
thankless work put in by the
big forwards was the basis
of the reversal, and despite
the early upsets, heads were
held high at the end, as the
match finished 24-14 to the
touring side.
The next step was to travel
to Vancouver Island, a short
ferry trip. The island itself is
larger than England, and the
towns were well Anglicised,
with a pleasant climate.
Again, emigration plans were
already being made by mem-
bers of the group.
A double-header was
arranged against Cowichan
Rugby Club, a team pre-sen-
sitised to hospitals rugby, hav-
ing played against a United
Hospitals Team in the recent
past. Indeed, one member of
the party was remembered by
the hosts (though the reasons
for this were not discussed).
The second XV kicked off
after some rather hurried
pre-match preparation, and
for the first half hour strug-
gled to resemble the team
that had played the previous
week. Consequently, the med-
ics were deservedly four tries
behind at the break. Although
the standards rose in the sec-
ond half, the team could not
prevent a poor 33-14 defeat.
This left the first XV with
the task of restoring some
pride, and as if on cue, the
goods were delivered. The
tries were again produced
en masse, with the impres-
sive Underwood picking up
another hat-trick. The per-
formance was earmarked by
many as one of the best that
the Imperial Medicals have
ever produced, and it was
hard to disagree, as the final
score was 56-0 in their favour.
The fresh crab and hospitality
that followed were also first
rate, and the squad headed
to celebrate in Victoria with
spirits high and voices out
of tune.
When back in Vancouver,
the Medicals had to take
stock of the player situation.
Unfortunately, they had been
left thin in certain positions
due to injury and departure,
so the final game against
local champions Abbotsford
was going to require a few
impromptu performances out
of position.
The second XV were hard-
est hit, and lined up against
a strong looking opposition
with a mish-mash of a back
line. However, strong charac-
ter again shone through and
the medics found themselves
ahead at half time. Sadly, lack
of incision at critical points
in the second half saw them
fail to capitalise on opportuni-
ties, and Abbotsford struck in
the dying minutes to win the
match 17-10.
The first XV were less dis-
organised, but facing tough
opposition at the end of a tir-
ing tour proved to be a dif-
ficult task. Although an early
score put them in front, they
relied on the metronomic
boot of Morris to keep them
ahead, and a hard fought 16-
15 victory was attained.
Thus, an amazing tour came
to a close. The good rugby
and good jokes were matched
only by the hospitality of the
locals and the quality of the
location. All of the tour party
felt privileged to be involved,
so heartfelt thanks must go to
those who made this possible:
Tina Phelan for all her hard
work, despite not being able
to attend; Dave and Shirley
Rollitt for their coaching (and
all-round parenting) on the
trip; Greg Hamilton-Eadie for
his efforts pre-tour (we also
wish Mary all the best for
the coming weeks); Dr Simon
Rogers, who was a first rate
replacement coach; and very
importantly, our benevolent
sponsors, without whom the
trip would not have been able
to proceed. We are indebted
to Siemens Medical Solutions,
Norwich Union Healthcare,
The St Mary’s Association
and the Hammersmith Fund.
“The firsts left
Calgary Irish
literally shell-
shocked, scoring
several tries”
Ready for action: the Imperial Medicals second team
as Imperial triumph
contingent of former and cur-
rent Imperial oarsmen out to
support.
For the first time at the
regatta, Imperial College
were slightly down after the
first ten stokes, but from
this point out to the barrier,
which marks about a quarter
of the distance, they steadily
moved out to a half length
lead. From here to halfway,
Imperial were again faster
than Isis, but were not able
to get clear water. As the race
moved into the final stages
down the enclosures, Isis
made a desperate push to get
back level but Imperial came
back strongly to win by half a
length.
Three of the crew (Ed
Johnson, Hugh Mackenzie
and Seb Pearce) then
moved on to the National
Championships, where they
combined with Molesey Boat
Club in order to start pre-
paring for the World Student
Games. This involved rowing
in a coxed four and eight, in
both cases the main rivals
being the old enemy, Oxford
Brookes. The heats of each
event passed uneventfully,
with the crew qualifying com-
fortably for the finals. First
up was the coxed four, where
Imperial/Molesey were rac-
ing the selected Great Britain
U23 coxed four as well as
the other half of the eight.
Unfortunately, an inexplica-
bly bad start left Imperial/
Molesey in sixth and last after
250m, and although they were
able to row through the field
and past Brookes into second
place, the other Molesey four
just managed to stay ahead
and claim the gold.
This boded extremely well
for the eight, and these pre-
dictions proved to be justified
as Imperial/Molesey pow-
ered through to beat Oxford
Brookes into silver medal
position and claim the blue
riband event of the regatta.
Most of the rowing popula-
tion would now be enjoying a
holiday, but Ed Johnson and
Hugh Mackenzie then com-
bined with Gavin Weeks and
Henry Adams (both former
University of London) to
form a coxless four for the
World Student Games, which
were held at the beginning
of September. After a long
month and a half spent train-
ing in this combination, the
crew flew out to Brive, France
with high hopes.
Eight crews had entered
the event, and Great Britain
were in a heat of five with
Chinese Taipei, New Zealand,
South Africa and Poland.
After an excellent start, they
had a half-length lead over
the field, but the strong Polish
crew (fresh from the Olympic
Games where they finished
sixth) then came through
to take the heat, with Great
Britain second, just ahead of
SouthAfrica.Intheotherheat,
the Irish won, with Germany
second and France third.
This put the British crew into
a repechage with Germany,
France, South Africa, New
Zealand and Chinese Taipei,
with four crews making the
final. A good lane draw and
confidence were also at stake.
Great Britain had an excel-
lent race, and although down
to France and Germany off
the start, they did not panic
and used superior pace
through the middle 500m to
move through the field and
take the lead, before holding
off a late charge from South
Africa.
The final was again in the
heat of the day, and a slight
mix-up with the timing meant
that the warm up had to be
slightly abbreviated. As the
race went off, Germany got
entangled with the lane buoys,
effectively ending their race
before it had really started.
The Poles got off to a flyer
and lead the field, with Great
Britain and Ireland about
level behind them. This situa-
tion continued down the track,
with the Poles moving gradu-
ally away from the field. At
the halfway mark, it was clear
that Poland were going to win
and that the race for the other
medals was purely between
Great Britain and Ireland.
Through the third 500m of the
race, Great Britain pushed
hard to come back level with
the Irish, but were unable to
sprint as hard and had to set-
tle for bronze, which still an
excellent result.
This capped an exception-
ally strong season for the
Boat Club, which they will be
looking to repeat next year. If
you would like to try rowing
