Following the success of the
Wye column in Felix in previ-
ous years, it is time that anoth-
er of Imperial’s campuses
finds its voice. Silwood Park
is situated in the Berkshire
countryside, around 45 min-
utes’ drive from the main
campus at South Kensington.
Originally a biology field
station, we are a growing
community of around 120 stu-
dents. Being all postgradu-
ates on site, this does not
stop us from celebrating
Freshers Week like the rest
of you! Students on the five
masters courses offered here
are introduced to life on the
wild side. Everything from
the natural history society to
rabbit catching and recipes
are covered in our extended
freshers fortnight.
To reassure newcomers
that living in the middle of
nowhere does have its advan-
tages, students are shipped
in to central London on their
first day to register (appar-
ently the carrier pigeon sys-
tem we have here is unre-
liable for getting important
registering details across).
Students then get the chance
to look around London and
visit the Union bars.
From then on they are
introduced to the social side
of Silwood, our pride and joy,
the bar, with activities rang-
ing from the usual pub quiz-
zes, discos and pub crawls
to the Silwood specific beeri-
enteering. Drinking with an
additional element of danger,
we give participants a map
with locations of where beer
is hidden and three hours to
find as many as they can. If
they have not returned within
five hours, we try to find the
lost students, but it is not so
easy when you combine alco-
hol with 100 hectares of land
to get lost in.
Contrary to popular belief
(especially of those who
live here), it is not all about
alcohol – with a diverse com-
munity such as ours there
are regular trips to Reading,
Southall, and Bracknell.
Life then calms down for
a few weeks while students
find their feet and start their
courses, but the much antici-
pated Silwood beer festival
looms around the corner
in November, followed by
Christmas, Burns Night (not
only for the Scottish contin-
gent), and the many events
planned for the coming year.
Some find it difficult to adapt
to the slower pace of living in
the countryside, miles from
any civilisation, but once you
have got into the swing of
life, the vast majority of peo-
ple enjoy it. We do not have
anywhere near the popula-
tion size as any of the other
campuses, but if you are not
one of the few biology or engi-
neering undergrads who have
the pleasure of being sent out
here, Silwood is well worth
a visit.
