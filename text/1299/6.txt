ADVICE SERVICE
NIGEL COOKE
UNION ADVISER
Greetings to everyone, to new stu-
dents, returning students and those
of us who have been slogging it out
through the summer. You can look
forward to my scribblings in future
editions of Felix, as I have the privi-
lege of running Imperial College
Union for a second year and shall
be writing here to explain what I am
doing with my time and your money,
as well as issues that affect the
Union or students generally.
Representation and elections
The main purpose of a students’
union is to act as the representative
voice of the students of the College.
You will read on the front page that
the College is embarked on a process
of reviewing its governance struc-
ture. Most of the outcomes of the
review (streamlining of committees)
will, in my opinion, benefit students
as they will improve the way that
the College is run. Unfortunately
there is a negative outcome which
is that there should be no staff or
student representatives on Council,
the College’s governing body.
At present there are six elect-
ed academic staff members of the
College Council in addition to the
Union President. A Union Deputy
President attends as an observer.
The proposals envisage there being
no representatives on the govern-
ing body as it is felt that this is
inappropriate, the role of governors
being to bring external scrutiny to
management on long-term strat-
gey. The College’s view is that staff
and student representatives’ role
is to interface with management,
not governors, on operational issues
– in the same way that trades unions
are not represented on the board of
directors of a company.
I believe that this recommenda-
tion is misguided. Universities are
not conventional “businesses”.
Imperial College is, largely, a public
funded body with responsibilities to
wider stakeholders. The role of the
governing body is to ensure that the
College is acting in the wider pub-
lic interest. Students are important
stakeholders in higher education.
We all pay fees to be here – money
we could take elsewhere. At the end
of the day, the future of the College
(and the reputation of our degrees)
is dependent on attracting the best
students to study here. Surely stu-
dents should be able to influence
that at the highest level?
The proposals are, at present,
just proposals. They need to be
approved by the next meeting of
College Council (unfortunately full of
‘yes’ men) and they then need to be
approved by the Queen through the
Privy Council, a process which will
take months, at least. It is important
to use this time to demonstrate the
importance of student representa-
tion. There are elections taking place
for membership of Union Council
(the students’ governing and policy-
making body) in the second week of
term. Be sure to vote. Every vote in
a Union election is a vote in favour
of the principle of student represen-
tation. All registered students are
automatically Union members and
can vote online. To find out more,
or to stand for election, visit www.
union.ic.ac.uk/elections.
Freshers Fair
Tuesday sees the Union’s annual
Freshers Fair. This year it will last
the whole day. If you are a fresher,
or even a continuing student, make
it an absolute priority to go around
and visit the stalls. Imperial College
Union spends more, per student,
funding clubs and societies than any
other students’ union in the country,
and it shows.
There are some 300 recognized
student societies at Imperial – far
more than anywhere else, offering
an unrivalled diversity of activities
and interests to get involved in.
Remember that the opportunities
you have now to try new activi-
ties and hobbies at cheap prices
will never be matched again. I have
friends now who have graduated
and moved onto high-flying jobs with
no spare time who wonder what they
did with all their time at Imperial
– so make the most of it while you
are here.
Finally...
The Union is here to serve you. If
you think there is something we are
doing wrong or have ideas for things
we could do better, please do not
hesitate to get in touch. My office
is on the first floor of the Union
Building and I’m always happy to
make time to see students.
Enjoy your time here.
Hello and welcome! If you’re a
returning student, then welcome
back, chin up, it’s not as bad as all
that; if you’re a fresher, congratula-
tions, you’ve arrived, you’re going
to have a superb time at Imperial
College.
Imperial (as I’m sure you’re fed up
of hearing) prides itself in the qual-
ity of its research and its teaching.
If you’re a research student, you will
be allocated a supervisor to help you
with your work; if you’re an under-
graduate, you will be assigned a per-
sonal tutor to keep an eye on your
academic progress and your gen-
eral welfare. We’ll deal with supervi-
sors later, since that’s a whole can of
worms of its own, and concentrate
for the moment on personal tutors.
Many people have told me that,
whilst some tutors are great, the
quality varies between departments
and individuals. In order to achieve
greater consistency in the personal
tutorial system, I will be conducting
a survey to find out what you think.
Watch this space!
Here are some typical things I
might be emailed about (or even
hear in the bar) regarding personal
tutors:
“Dear Sam,
I am a first year student in the
Department of X. At the beginning
of the year, some administrator
mentioned something about a per-
sonal tutor, but I don’t know who
mine is, and I certainly haven’t met
them. Some of my friends in other
departments tell me that their per-
sonal tutors are really helpful, and
a re-app in my hall once mentioned
that his tutor helped him get back
onto his course after he’d failed. I’m
worried that I’m missing out by not
knowing who mine is. It would be
great if you could help me, because I
don’t know who else to turn to.”
I would reply:
“You are right to be concerned
about not knowing who your per-
sonal tutor is. They are an invalua-
ble contact within your department.
They should monitor your academic
progress, ensure that you get all
the help you need, and make sure
you know what’s going on in your
department. If you haven’t done your
coursework, you might find them
chasing you up, but remember, they
have your best interests at heart!
It is also important that someone
in the department is keeping an eye
out for your personal well-being: in
cases where this affects academic
performance, they can help you
more the earlier they know about
any problems. This help can include
anything from pointing you in the
direction of appropriate welfare sup-
port to helping you with your case
should you need to make an appeal
against an academic decision.
Your tutor is also a good person to
ask to write you a reference when
you apply for a job, so it’s important
that you have a good working rela-
tionship.
You should make it a priority to
find out who your tutor is, meet
them, and stay in regular contact.
Good luck!”
