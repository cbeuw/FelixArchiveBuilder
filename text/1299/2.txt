An emergency night bus
service from the main Union
building in South Kensington
will return on a trial basis
this term.
The service, which will
provide safe transport home
for vulnerable students on
ents nights, was cancelled in
summer 2003, when a senior
Union officer described it as
“inefficient” and “a waste of
money”.
However, Sameena Misba-
huddin, the Deputy President
(Finance and Services), told
Felix that the service had
been “badly managed in the
past” and that “a lot of stu-
dents have asked for it to be
brought back”.
Miss Misbahuddin, whose
pledge to reintroduce the
service may have won her
crucial votes in this year’s
sabbatical elections, contin-
ued: “It will be an emergency
service intended for the vul-
nerable, which means single
women, single men, small
groups of women, and others
at the Ents Manager’s discre-
tion.”
The night bus will run dur-
ing Freshers Week and on
Friday nights throughout
the autumn term, typically
with two trips each evening,
though this will depend on
demand. The trial will gather
information on who has used
the service, why they have
used it and where they have
been taken.
The ‘worst case scenario’
cost of the trial has been cal-
culated at £1073.15 per term,
although Miss Misbahuddin
is confident of cutting this by
recruiting volunteers to drive
and navigate the minibus.
The emergency night bus
has been criticised in the past
for providing transport for
students who do not genuine-
ly need it. Groups of people
have been allowed to travel in
previous years, and students
may have become reliant on
the possibility of a ‘free ride
home’.
Miss Misbahuddin stressed
that this would not occur in
the future, as only emergency
cases of vulnerable students
would be permitted to use the
night bus. She added: “We’re
going to keep a much stricter
record of who is going on the
minibus and why, and we have
to check if they are using it
every week because there is
an issue there as well.”
Club and society officials
have expressed concern at
the reintroduction of the
service, claiming that it will
divert money and resources
away from club and society
activities.
However,MissMisbahuddin
insists that the trial will final-
ly allow the Union to consider
the future of the emergency
night bus properly, as no suit-
able data has been collected
in the past.
“It will be an
emergency
service intended
for the
vulnerable”

New
handbooks
published
The Imperial College Union
Handbook 2004 was published
last week. This 176-page A5
publication is a comprehen-
sive guide to the Union and
everything that it can do for
students, whilst also serving
as an introduction to life at
Imperial College.
All UK-based freshers
should have received a copy
by post, and all other fresh-
ers will be given one at the
overseas students’ welcome
meetings.
Copies of the handbook
are available to all students
from Union reception and
the Student Activities Centre
throughout the year. You can
also pick one up at the Felix
and Union stands at Freshers
Fair. Any comments or ques-
tions about the Union hand-
book should be directed to the
Felix office.
Also available is the latest
Imperial College Student
Handbook, which has been
put together by the College
Registry. This is a sepa-
rate publication from the
Union handbook, and can be
accessed online at www.ic.ac.
uk/studenthandbook. It is
designed to help you through-
out your course of study.
There is important infor-
mation about where to go for
advice and support, and about
student facilities at Imperial
College. The pages will be
updated throughout the year,
so it would be useful to visit
them regularly. Comments
and suggestions about this
handbook should be sent
to Ruth Ellis, the Assistant
Registrar (Undergraduate
Admissions) at ruth.ellis@ic.
ac.uk.
Continued from page 1
The Union urged the
College to “safeguard the
current student cohort at
the Wye campus, in partic-
ular ensuring that they are
examined and graduate with
degrees of the academic
standard they expected on
admission” and to “engage
in consultation with students
at Wye and other life sciences
departments”.
The College has discussed
the plans with representa-
tives from teaching unions,
but their statement expressed
no intention to consult stu-
dents.
Under the proposals, some
staff will move from the
Department of Agricultural
Sciences into other depart-
ments, but around 30 aca-
demic staff will lose their
jobs, as will a corresponding
number of support staff.
Undergraduate teach-
ing will continue at
Wye, but only in Applied
Business Management. The
Management Board has also
recommended that a new
DepartmentofEnvironmental
Sciences be created.
The College insist that stu-
dents starting courses at Wye
up to and including 2005 will
not be affected. Their state-
ment continues: “The partial
withdrawal of teaching, and
the withdrawal of research,
from the Wye campus will be
planned in detail after the
consultation exercise.”
The Wye campus has been a
centre of learning since 1447,
when it was founded as a col-
lege for secular priests. It
merged with Imperial College
in August 2000.
Imperial plans sweeping changes at Wye
Rural restructuring: under Imperial College proposals, far less undergraduates will be able to enjoy the picturesque
surroundings of Wye in future years
“The Faculty’s
presence at the
Wye campus is
not economically
viable”
