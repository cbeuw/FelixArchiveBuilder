There will be no student rep-
resentation whatsoever on
the main governing body of
Imperial College, if current
proposals are accepted at its
next meeting.
Felix has obtained a copy of
a letter sent to the members
of Imperial College Council
which outlines recommenda-
tions for sweeping changes
to the governance of the
College. The present student
representative, the Union
President, would be removed
from the Council, as would all
members of academic staff
outside the senior manage-
ment team.
DrEileenButtle,theCouncil
Chairman, wrote the letter to
report on the progress of her
review of the Council and its
Committees. She is due to
present formal recommenda-
tions on 15 October.
The letter states that “the
governing body should be
seen as a meeting between
those responsible for deliver-
ing the College’s plans and
non-executives charged with
ensuring that those plans are
delivered in the interests of
wider stakeholders in this
prestigious UK university...
If this revised model for the
Council is adopted, elected
members have no role to
play.”
The letter continues: “I
would propose that the
Imperial College Union be
treated as analogous to a
department outside the facul-
ty structure. The President of
ICU should be invited annu-
ally to Council to submit his
Union’s annual report.”
Imperial College already
has a low level of student rep-
resentation on the governing
body compared to other uni-
versities, and if the proposals
were accepted, it would be the
only university with no stu-
dent representation at all.
Mustafa Arif, President of
Imperial College Union, called
the proposals “misguided”
and told Felix: “Students are
the most important stake-
holders in higher education.
Council is there to hold man-
agement to account over
College’s long term strategy.
The College’s future depends
on attracting and retaining
the best students, so stu-
dent representatives should
be able to contribute to that
process.”
Senior figures within
Government would appear to
disagree with Dr Buttle’s rec-
ommendations. Answering a
written question in the House
of Lords on 13 September,
LordFilkin,theParliamentary
Under Secretary of State,
said: “In our response to the
Dearing report in 1998 we
supported the recommenda-
tion that students should be
represented on the governing
bodies of all higher education
institutions. We continue to
support this principle.”
The Council is expected to
approve Dr Buttle’s proposals
at its next meeting. However,
students’ groups and teach-
ing unions are likely to lobby
against them. The forthcom-
ing review of Imperial by the
Quality Assurance Agency is
seen as extremely important,
and it could count against the
College if the Agency decides
that students’ views are not
being heard.
Tony Mitcheson, the
College Secretary and Clerk
to the Council, said: “Council
is about the non-executives
holding executive manage-
ment to account. Students
should be focusing their effort
and input on day-to-day man-
agement and operations.” He
stressed that the plans were
only proposals and were to be
debated at the next meeting.
Professor Rees Rawlings,
theProRectorforEducational
Quality, told Felix that the
proposals would have “no
negative effect on education-
al quality, because that is all
dealt with by the Senate [the
College’s senior academic
committee]”.
Although the Senate may
be able to deal with academic
issues, it remains to be seen
how the Council of an aca-
demic institution can govern
effectively without represent-
atives from the student body
or the academic staff.

Maximum fees
Two thirds of all universities
are set to charge the maxi-
mum fee of £3000 for every
course. Many are driven by
fears of appearing second rate
and having insufficient money
to fund bursary schemes.

Future
of Wye
campus
in doubt
By Dave Edwards
Editor
Last month, Imperial College
announced plans to trans-
fer most courses away from
the Wye campus, close the
Department of Agricultural
Sciences and consider the
future of the campus in a
review.
The College Management
Board has launched a consul-
tation process recommend-
ing that the Faculty of Life
Sciences is restructured. In
a statement, the College said
that the principal aim was
to maintain “a world class
institution for teaching and
research in life sciences”.
It appears that the changes
are financially motivated, with
the Faculty of Life Sciences
predicting a deficit of £11.6m
by the end of the 2006-7 finan-
cial year. The Department of
Agricultural Sciences, which
is wholly based at Wye, con-
tributes a loss of £1.8m per
year.
Professor Sir Leszek
Borysiewicz, the Deputy
Rector designate, said: “The
financial position of the
Faculty of Life Sciences is
unsustainable and cannot
be allowed to continue. The
Faculty’s presence at the Wye
campus in its current con-
figuration is not economically
viable.”
The proposals were met
with dismay by students and
staff at Wye. Imperial College
Union issued a statement
expressing its concern at
“the lack of consultation and
vague nature of statements
about the future of agricul-
tural sciences and teaching
at Wye”.
