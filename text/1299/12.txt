RAG Chair
RAG. Some of you may have
heard of it, some not. Put sim-
ply, it is the Imperial soci-
ety that gets people to cause
havoc, make fools of them-
selves and push the patience
of authority to its very limits
– and beyond.
It is the only society whose
name, when mentioned,
might just persuade the
police to release you back
into the public domain with-
out charge following arrest.
The only requirement for you
to be allowed to partake in
the chaos is to carry a collect-
ing tin and get the London
fat cats to put some of their
unearned bonuses into it.
For those in doubt as to the
kind of insanity I am talking
about, past examples include
rowing around the Trafalgar
Square fountains dressed as
a monkey, streaking through
the Bank of England, tiddly-
winking the entire length of
Oxford Street and pub crawl-
ing your way around all 26
streets on the Monopoly
board.
“But why do people do
this?” I hear you cry. Well,
it’s for charity. This year
our nominated charities are
Cancer Research UK and
the Mercury Phoenix AIDS
Foundation – worthy of a bit
of time and effort I’m sure.
The focus of all this mad-
nessisRAGWeekinFebruary,
when a great many students
will miss lectures to help
put a little laughter into the
World of Highly Depressed
Londoners in what is, after
all, one of the more miserable
months of the year. To join in
the frivolity, all you have to
do is turn up – a member of
the Union is automatically a
member of RAG.
If you fancy doing more
than just turning up and want
to get involved in the organi-
sational side of things, visit us
at the Freshers Fair. In fact,
visit us anyway, for we have a
large stock of pint glasses and
mugs to give away in return
for donations to our cause.
We know that February is a
long way away, so this year we
have decided to end Freshers
Week with a warm-up pub
crawl on 9 October from mid-
day. The route is a tour of
central London’s landmarks,
giving you the perfect chance
to practice drunken navigat-
ing whilst familiarising your-
self with this great city.
To join in the fun, just get
a selection of your friends
together (about six would do
nicely) and come along to
the Union from midday on
the 9th. You will be kitted out
with tins and buckets, and
the route will be disclosed in
all its glory. As with all RAG
events, silly dress is option-
al but strongly encouraged.
Prizes will be given entirely
at my discretion for anything
that vaguely amuses me or
for making stupidly large
amounts of cash.
Insanity for charity
Monkey business: the last time Imperial RAG were released on London
By Martin Chong
So once again I found myself
ready to head down to Devon
for two and a bit weeks with a
bunch of all-singing, all-tap-
dancing cast, some “I might
dance if drunk enough” band
members and a “not even
remotely going to try to dance
crew” (or so they claimed).
The purpose? To convert the
town hall into a theatre for
ten performances of Cole
Porter’s Anything Goes, just
like the other 30-odd times
that MTSoc Tour have done
it!
Before we left the Union,
there was the fun task of
packing steel deck, bits of
set, lights, microphones and
about two and a half weeks’
worth of kit multiplied by lots
of people into an 18 ton lorry.
Upon our arrival in Devon,
our first stop was the local pub
for a well-earned pint, before
heading off to the school.
This became our home for
the whole of the tour, with the
option to sleep in a tent or
in classrooms. Airbeds were
definitely essential items.
For the next five days,
the hall was filled with the
sound of power tools and the
smell of fried breakfast amid
much drinking of tea by the
crew. Meanwhile, the cast
did their usual last-minute
panic rehearsals, with the
band sauntering in a few days
later. The tech rehearsal ran
fairly smoothly, as did the
huge order of fish and chips
halfway through for cast and
crew. Afterwards, it was a
case of all hands on deck as
we strove to finish the set for
the dress rehearsal the next
morning and the first per-
formance in the evening.
Thus the fateful date
arrived. All in all, it went very
well, up until when I, as the
lighting operator, switched off
the band lights just as they
were doing their exit music.
Never mind. Fortunately, the
Donkey award for the worst
gaffe of the night was pre-
sented to the sound operator
for forgetting to mute one of
the mics, resulting in a mut-
tered ‘shit’ ringing around the
venue from backstage. And
then the party began…
The next two weeks saw
a general pattern form: get
steamed out of your tent at
some point in the morning,
have breakfast, find a shady
spot, fall asleep (the hall with
the fans on was found to be
best for this), find lunch,
resume sleeping, reset stage,
find dinner, do show, go to
pub, have party, and get
into tent just before crack of
dawn. This was punctuated
by after-show barbecues, vis-
its to the local purveyor of
ice cream, costume parties,
a jazz night and of course the
middle weekend dinner.
The venue got more and
more packed each day, cul-
minating in the final night
being completely sold out.
Then, all too soon, the curtain
descended for the final time.
The crew immediately got to
work to strike the set, giving
up at about 4am to catch a
couple of hours’ sleep before
loading up at 8am. Until, that
is, we returned to the venue
to find that the lorry hadn’t
even left the depot in North
London yet.
For me, that was the end
of the tour, as some of us
had to dash back to London.
But loading finally occurred
eight hours later, and when
everything was finally packed
away in the Union on Monday,
the tour officially reached its
conclusion.
All that leaves is for me to
find a nice work placement
that lets me go again next
year! Roll on tour...
