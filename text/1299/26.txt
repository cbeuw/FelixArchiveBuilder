The Imperial College Union
Boat Club finished an excep-
tionally strong season
with success at the Henley
Royal Regatta, the National
Championships and the World
Student Games this summer.
Although the club has been
highly successful over the
past few years, winning at
a wide variety of different
events in the UK and abroad,
it had not won at Henley since
1998. The event is the most
prestigious domestic regatta
in the world, and the club
had come very close to vic-
tory there on a number of
recent occasions. This year,
they entered a team into a
new event, the men’s stu-
dent coxed four. The club
also had two eights entered
in the Temple Challenge Cup
(for student eights) and a B
crew in the coxed four event,
which unfortunately failed to
qualify.
On the Wednesday of this
five day regatta, the first
Imperial crew to race was
our B eight, who had drawn
Manchester University’s
first eight. The crew, mainly
made up of this year’s nov-
ices, put up a strong fight but
eventually succumbed to the
Manchester crew, who had
been finalists at the BUSA
regatta.
The coxed four had a fairly
comfortable race against
the University of London B
crew, who put all they had
into the first half of the race,
their challenge fading rap-
idly from that point on. The
Temple A crew then raced
Glasgow University, coached
by Imperial College gradu-
ate Nigel ‘Killer’ Atkins.
Unfortunately, the Scots,
aided by Nigel’s inside knowl-
edge, put up too strong a
fight for Imperial to match,
although the race was very
close.
Thursday dawned with only
one Imperial crew – the four
– left in the regatta. They
were up against Cambridge
University, who, though small
and rather scrawny, seemed
to think that they would be
able to repeat their feat of last
year, when they had won the
event. However, the Imperial
crew of Ed Johnson, Hugh
Mackenzie, George Whittaker
and Simon Hislop, coxed by
Seb Pearce, blew Cambridge
away, with the race over well
before the halfway stage.
Friday was a rest day, so
the semi-final was not until
Saturday. This was against
Trinity College Dublin. This
crew had already been
beaten at the Gent regatta
in Belgium, but were looking
for revenge. However, once
again, Imperial gradually
drew away, and a comfortable
lead going down the enclo-
sures meant that a sprint was
not needed and the crew were
in the final.
Sunday at Henley is now
entirely given over to finals,
with the student coxed four
being the last one. This meant
that the crew had the whole
day to get nervous, before
going down to the course in
the afternoon. The strong
headwinds that had been a
feature of this regatta for
the whole week were again
present, meaning that times
would be slow, and the oppo-
nents for the final, Isis (from
Oxford University) had the
favoured inside station. As
both crews made their way
up to the start, the tension
was obvious, with a very large
“Isis made a
desperate push
to get level but
Imperial came
back strongly
to win by half a
length”
