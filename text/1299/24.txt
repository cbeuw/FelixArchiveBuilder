Just over 2000 years ago, seven
kingdoms struggled for access
to the human capital and natural
resources of what is now modern-
day China. Between 230 and 221 BC,
the Kingdom of Qin, ruled by Qin
Shihuangdi, waged war and con-
quered the other six kingdoms, uni-
fying the country into what would
become the first dynasty of China.
Qin had the idea of unifying ‘all
under heaven’.
Hero tells the story of an assas-
sin called Nameless (Jet Li), who
visits the highly unpopular and
aspiring Emperor Qin (Chen) to
enlighten the Emperor of how he
has vanquished three of the most
infamous assassins and enemies of
Qin: Broken Sword (Tony Leung),
Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and
Sky (Donnie Yen). For such heroic
service, Nameless is granted an
audience within ten paces of the
Emperor and asked to recount the
details of his victories. However, as
Nameless begins to tell his story
about how he used a love trian-
gle involving the three assassins to
divide and conquer, Qin begins to
see holes in the account and senses
that all is not what it seems.
While the comparisons with
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
are inevitable, the style of Hero is
quite different. While Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon was made
more accessible to Western audi-
ences through scripting and a love
story, the dialogue in Hero is typi-
cally what you would expect in a tra-
ditional Chinese martial arts epic,
with plenty of terse speech.
Hero is one of the most visu-
ally stunning films to have been
released in recent times, surpassing
the viewer’s imagination (which is
not easy) with some truly inspired
scenes. The amalgamation of col-
our and movement is simply amaz-
ing. The action scenes are choreo-
graphed to perfection. The martial
arts sequences put those of The
Matrix and Kill Bill to shame. Hero
was actually completed in 2002 –
before Kill Bill – but was its release
was delayed, to avoid Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
The plot is not as strong as one
would have hoped, but the under-
lying message is as bleak as it is
thought provoking – the unifying
force of totalitarianism is valued
above democracy and individual
freedom, and the path to peace is
often through conflict.
The cast is littered with star names
from Hong Kong. Maggie Cheung is
striking and elegant, fitting the bill
as the love interest. Tony Leung
plays the calligraphy master with
equal parts sensitive beauty and
rough toughness. However Zhang
Ziyi, as Moon, suffers in a peripheral
role as Broken Sword’s understudy,
given very little to do other than a
few fight scenes. Yen only appears
briefly at the beginning of the film,
though he manages to make quite
an impression in his limited screen
time. Finally Jet Li is impressive as
a distant and stone cold killer.
Hero is not about the star cast, the
rather weak plot, or the poignant
ending. It is quite simply a glori-
ous visual treat. Watching it is like
watching a dream that is awash in
vivid colour and splashed in liquid
imagination.

I need a Hero
Yimou’s epic is visually awesome, but slightly let down by the plot
