Hello! You won’t have seen me
before, unless you’ve been read-
ing imported copies of Oxford
University’s Cherwell. If you like
the Times crossword you should
get along fine with my puzzles, and
consequently if you’re more into
The Guardian you might think the
clue structures a bit conservative.
Telegraph solvers may find them a
bit more challenging. If you do The
Independent, it must be because
you read the paper for reasons unre-
lated to the crossword.
I hope that puts me in perspective.
My grids tend to be slightly playful
and are sometimes thematic; this
week’s is neither, as I have a wretch-
ed dissertation to write. Any com-
ments will be gratefully received.

Send your answers to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk or bring this page down to the Felix office in
the West Wing of Beit Quad. Each week, we’ll choose a winner and print their name, thus
providing them with almost unlimited kudos and self-satisfaction. Everyone who provides
us with a correct solution will get an entry into our prize draw at the end of the year (if you
don’t know what I’m talking about, have a look at the “FUCCA Winners” box, above)

For each correct solution we received throughout the year, the solver was
given one entry in our prize draw. The more crosswords you completed,
the more chance you had of winning. Why not take a look at Snufkin’s puz-
zle below and enter this year’s Awards? Last year’s winners were:

Hello friends, and welcome (or welcome back) to the fish tank.
This week, we present a pub quiz style picture board for your amusement
and intellectual stimulation, together with a crossword from our brand new
setter, Snufkin. If you can solve either, we’d like to hear from you, and we
might just give you a mention next week.
Sadly this week’s Coffee Break is all too brief, as Powersheep has finally
moved on to pastures new (get it?) and we have no-one to replace him. If
you fancy setting some interesting challenges (well, any sort of strange
little games would do) to entertain the masses during lectures (or even dur-
ing their coffee breaks), then let us know at coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk. We’d be
pleased to have you on board.
