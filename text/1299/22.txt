There’s something afoot in the pub-
lishing industry. Book collectors
are all excited about a forthcoming
novel. This novel has been com-
pared to the works of Tolkien. It has
been compared to Harry Potter. It
has been compared to anything and
everything successful in the fan-
tasy market. And, of course, most of
these comparisons are quite wrong:
this book is rather unique.
Let’s begin by describing the
premise: in the book, Britain is an
island with a very strong magical
and mystical history. But at the start
of the nineteenth century, magic is
in decline. It is strictly a theoretical
science, with no practical applica-
tion – like advanced maths with a
twist. Two magicians aim to reverse
all of that, to revive English practi-
cal magic. These two magicians are
Mr Norrell, a paranoid eccentric,
and Jonathan Strange, a foolhardy
youth. Mr Norrell brings his abilities
to public attention and proposes to
help out in the war against France.
And so their adventures begin.
It is perhaps the notion of magi-
cians that causes a lot of the com-
parisons. Magicians have become
part of pop culture. Any newcomer
has Harry Potter, Dumbledore and
Gandalf to measure up against.
Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell
are quite different men. They don’t
grow long white beards. They don’t
wave around any wands or staffs.
Neither of them could be described
as being particularly wise. In short,
they aren’t the archetypes we are
used to. Mr Norrell is studious, but
paranoid. Strange is adventurous,
but easily distracted. These literary
magicians are amply supplied with
the things that many of their coun-
terparts in other stories lack: flaws,
depth and individuality.
But to focus on just the two magi-
cians is to do this story a great
injustice. There are fascinating and
enchanting characters aplenty. We
meet ministers and prophets, wives
and servants, fairies and generals.
Indeed, it is often easier to identify
with the struggles of the servants,
or the wives, than either of the two
magicians.
Reading this novel is quite a
delightful experience. It starts out
playful and witty. A few hundred
pages later, it is a tale of magi-
cal adventures in the war against
Napoleon. And yet another few hun-
dred pages later, the story becomes
much darker, almost heartbreaking.
I found it impossible not to connect
and identify with the characters,
and I can only commend Mrs Clarke
for achieving this feat.
Looking at the book in a shop,
you will notice its length. The novel
starts out at a leisurely pace. It’s the
written equivalent of a comfortable
stroll in a beautiful, enchanted land-
scape, where every pond and every
hill is a wonderful thing to behold. In
fact, it is not merely a single story,
it’s a revelation of a world of stories.
If you have read The Neverending
Story (by Michael Ende), you may
recall all the places where the
author seems to get distracted by
a snippet of story, only to announce
“but that is another story, and shall
be told another time”. Well, Susanna
Clarke clearly does not agree with
this way of writing. Her book is
full of little background fables and
myths. And each of those tales is a
marvel of its own.
This is a very enchanting novel
indeed, full of beautiful, witty prose
and delights for any reader. No, it
isn’t like Tolkien or Rowling or Feist.
It’s a different beast, and I am glad it
has been discovered.

Mr Norrell

HHHHH
You started this book ten years
ago. When you set out, what did
you expect it to become?
I think my expectations were pretty
low. I’d never completed a novel
before. I’d started several. One of
them was supposed to be a literary
novel, one was a detective novel, one
was a fantasy novel. So I didn’t really
know whether I could complete it,
but I thought it was a very good
idea, and I had its shape in my head.
But it grew, it grew in complexity as
I went on. I didn’t know when I set
out that I was going to pin it so much
to real facts and have so much real
history in it, but as I progressed this
seemed a natural thing to do.
The real history is all about the
Napoleonic Wars...
And also the social background. And
in some cases, placings. I’ve tried
to be as accurate as I can about,
for example, London and Venice,
and the sort of social background
position of women and the servants
and so forth. I tried to make that as
accurate as I can, a sort of blend to
ground the magic. I find that magic
becomes more believable when you
put it next to something which is
quite mundane and quite ordinary.
The majority of the characters
appear to be male. Were you ever
tempted to give big magical pow-
ers to a female character?
I wasn’t, in this novel, although
the first short story I published is
about three woman magicians. So,
I did it there, but in the main book
I wanted to concentrate on Strange
and Norrell. And it is a male book,
because it’s... it’s this thing about
being accurate about the time in
which people lived. Women were
not powerless in the regency period
– I think later in the Victorian period
their opinions were less valued – but
the world of action belonged very
much to men, and women’s sphere
was the domestic sphere. And I
wanted to be realistic about that.
Which is why I think it’s become a
book that is largely about men. The
next one, maybe not so much.
What about the next one? Do you
already have a plan for it?
A plan is possibly putting it a bit
strongly. I have something of a
plan, and I have started, and I know
roughly what’s gonna happen. But
I’m not a great planner, unfortu-
nately. It’s just not the way I work.
But it is set in the same world, and
it will start shortly after Strange &
Norrell finishes.
One of the characters I couldn’t
help but feel you were a big fan of
was the Duke of Wellington. He’s
always seen in a heroic light...
Yes. I mean, he surprised me in the
sense that when I researched him,
I just got more and more entranced
by him. And in a very curious way,
he’s a self-made man as well. He
really was. I mean, he was born into
a privileged class, the son of an Earl,
which doesn’t sound particularly
underprivileged. But he didn’t have
a title at the beginning of his life, his
family expected absolutely nothing
of him, they didn’t even think he
would be a very good soldier. And he
just continually formed himself into
the person he wanted to be. When
he arrived in the peninsula, nobody
really expected him to succeed, and
nobody really knew how it was pos-
sible to succeed. But he worked out
what you would have to do to get
rid of the French, what sort of army
was needed to get rid of the French,
and what sort of general was needed
to command that army. And then
he turned the army into the army
that could do it, and himself into the
general that could command that
army. And that is impressive. Plus,
he was very witty, and always wore
cool clothes. Great!
A brilliant hero. You could almost
imagine him being played by one
of Hollywood’s biggest stars...
Yes, except for the nose. They gotta
have the nose. He was called Nosey
by his men, so you’ve got to have
this long nose.
There goes the heartache hero of
the story... a big nose. Have you
thought about movie adaptations
very much?
There’s a lot of interest at the
moment. Partly from the fact that,
obviously, fantasy books are very
hot, as far as Hollywood is con-
cerned. Apart from feeling rather
grateful that I don’t have to do it, and
won’t be asked to do it, it baffles me
entirely how you would technically
turn this into a film.
Would you trust the film-makers
to turn it into a good film?
You have to. I think, what you’d do,
is to hopefully choose the right film-
maker, if you get the chance. I’m not
the right person to do this. So, if it’s
gonna be done it would have to be
done by someone else.
So are you all excited about the
book coming out soon?
I’ve been excited for a very long
time, actually. It’s great! There’s a
lot planned for the tour in America,
and then I’ll be doing more stuff over
here. So, it’s a very exciting time.
It’s not a very writerly time. I’ll have
to wait until this is out of the way.
I must admit, I thought becoming
a professional writer would involve
more actual writing than it appears
to, but that’s the way it turned out,
and I’m very grateful.
Are you ready to face up to large
queues of fans?
I’m not at all sure about the large
queues of fans. I mean it is wonder-
ful that Bloomsbury are telling so
many people about it, but it is a first
novel... I think we’ll wait and see.
Well, proof copies sell for £100 on
eBay, and more...
Book collectors seem to see me as a
safe bet, so that’s a good sign.
