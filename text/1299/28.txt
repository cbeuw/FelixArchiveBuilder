Imperial Medicals RFC
Tour of Canada 2004
By Piers Thomas
Success on the pitch was
matched by the players’ enjoy-
ment of their surroundings as
a 42-strong Imperial Medicals
party toured Canada over the
summer.
The tour had been a source
of excitement for several
months, and the party arrived
in Calgary, Alberta on 15 July.
Confidence was high follow-
ing a successful season, and
there was a good number of
doctors, bringing experience
to supplement the enthusi-
asm of the younger players.
The squad billeted at the
University of Calgary, where
the first couple of days were
spent training and acclima-
tising. There was universal
acclaim for the impressive
sports facilities that the
North American colleges
offer their students, includ-
ing an Olympic speed-skating
circuit. It’s a shame that our
own Charing Cross campus
doesn’t have the potential for
such development.
The Medicals were fortu-
nate to be visiting Calgary
during the annual ‘Stampede’,
where the locals enjoy getting
back to their cowboy roots
with rodeos and such like.
On the day of the first game,
the squad arrived at the host
club to the bad news that the
scheduled first XV opposition
were unable to field a side.
This was attributed to hard
games over the previous few
days and, one may suggest,
even harder drinking at the
stampede. This cancellation
meant that the second XV
were cast onto centre stage
in the opening game, against
a useful side from an upstate
town, Red Deer.
Red Deer had been
described as an American
football team who occasion-
ally played rugby, so there
was understandably a little
trepidation in the warm-up,
mainly centred around who
would get their ribs broken
first. Pleasingly, this proved
not to be the case, as the
Medicals ran riot for large
periods of the game.
With the forwards hitting
well above their weight all
afternoon, the backs were
able to cut the opposition
open with some talented run-
ning. The final score was 42-
12 in the medics’ favour.
It is also worth noting that
Calgary stands around 1000m
above sea level and was in the
middle of a record heat wave
at the time, so the game was
particularly demanding, as
demonstrated by the number
of players post-match who
spurned an offer of beer in
favour of cold water.
The following evening
saw the first XV open their
account against Calgary
Irish, a vaunted team con-
taining a number of high level
players, including the current
Canadian international full-
back. Whether spurred on by
the disappointing cancellation
