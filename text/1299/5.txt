This is your platform, the next train is for science
Welcome back to the science
pages of Felix. In my second
year as science editor, I in-
tend to continue along the
same lines as last year. The
aim, as before, is to report on
some of the latest develop-
ments in the world of science
and to publish your opinions
and feature articles on sci-
ence in its larger, societal
context.
To believe that it is pos-
sible to continue practising
science in a political and cul-
tural vacuum is a myth just
about as absurd as believ-
ing that the Earth is flat.
For science to progress in
the modern world, scientists
have to be able to communi-
cate the meaning and pur-
pose of what they are doing
to society. A research inter-
face exists not only between
science and business (as we
are only too keenly aware
at Imperial College), but
between politics, culture, the
media, and even the arts.
At the same time, scien-
tists have to stay true to sci-
entific values and reaffirm
the importance of objectivity
in their work. How should the
scientific community recon-
cile the objectivity demand-
ed by their vocation and the
subjective values that are so
prevalent in politics and the
media? This is one of the
issues, amongst many oth-
ers, that Felix Science can
address during the course of
the year.
Last year, we had articles
on a very wide variety of
subjects, ranging from the
controversy surrounding
genetically modified foods
through to quantum theory,
the existence of God, and
even the effect of LSD and
crack on spiders. There are
many other things to write
about, of course.
And it doesn’t always
have to be serious – a sense
of humour is obligatory,
because you can’t take any-
one who hasn’t got a sense
of humour seriously. So
I hope that this year you,
the reader, will continue to
find something of interest
in these pages and will also
find the time to contribute to
this, your forum.

The release of Morgan
Spurlock’s highly anticipated
Super Size Me has drawn
the public’s attention to a
$1 trillion industry whose
unscrupolous and immoral
marketing tactics have dam-
aged the health of millions.
Be it in lobbying for favour-
able trade laws, pushing for
changes in food legislation, or
strategically recruiting nutri-
tional scientists to promote
the dubious health content of
their products, today’s food
industry has unprecedented
influence in government and
science to promote its inter-
ests at the expense of the
consumer’s health.
Hardly a day goes past
without us being told what we
should be eating. On televi-
sion, on the radio, in scientif-
ic journals, various foods are
championed or denounced for
their so-called health value.
In addition to the dissemi-
nation of confusing dietary
advice, microbial outbreaks,
uncertainty about GM foods,
and the emerging fear of food
bioterrorism have contribut-
ed to bewildering the masses
and have lead to a climate of
dietary paranoia which suits
the interests of food market-
ers. From obesity epidemics
to childhood diabetes, from
foot-and-mouth to salmonel-
la, over the years the system
has failed to find a balance
betweens consumer inter-
ests and the food industry’s
insatiable greed.
The facts are uncompro-
mising. In a matter of seven
years between 1991 and 1998,
the rate of adult obesity
increased from 12% to 18%
in the US. Today it is reck-
oned that one third of the US
population is clinically obese.
The figures are reflected in
the UK where the blame for
increasing rates of childhood
diabetes in recent years has
been placed at the door of
poor dietary practices. The
number of people dying
from the effects of a highly
sedentary lifestyle, dietary
apathy and an increasing
calorific intake is also on
the increase. Can this be
blamed on the food industry,
whose unscrupulous mar-
keting of their products has
consisted of a constant “eat
more” message? Should the
food industry be regulated
so that unhealthy products
are labelled in a similar way
to tobacco products? Should
advertising aimed at children
be banned in order to pro-
mote healthy nutritional eth-
ics from an early age?
In no area of industry is the
failure to consolidate public
and commercial interests
more evident and paradig-
matic than in the field of pub-
lic nutrition. And nowhere are
the difficulties more manifest
than in the US. There, the
government has been advis-
ing people on what to eat for
over a century now. To begin
with, and up until the 1970s,
a succession of administra-
tions advised the populus to
“eat more”. The objective
was, ostensibly, to address
issues of malnutrition and
vitamin deficiency that afflict-
ed a significant proportion
of the population. However,
towards the late seventies
the government’s message
had to change. Scientific
research identified a high-
cholesterol diet as a major
cause of heart disease and
other chronic health prob-
lems. In its duty to protect
the nation’s health, they had
to radically shift policy from
“eat more” to “eat less”. This
was a move that would never
sit well with food producers,
who had long been used to
favourable market conditions
for selling products. To this
day, the food industry has
fought in the law courts and
lobbied Congress to prevent
this simple message of “eat
less” getting to a public eat-
ing themselves to death.
The American food indus-
try manipulates the public
through marketing and
influences Congress legisla-
tors and regulators through
lobbying. In doing so, the
actions of the food industry
are thoroughly analogous to
that of the US tobacco indus-
try in trying to influence sci-
entists, federal agencies and
the government to promote
the marketing and legitimacy
of their product. Food compa-
nies use every means avail-
able to create and protect an
environment that is condu-
cive to selling their products
to a public.
It could be argued that in
this sense food companies are
no different to a whole host of
other industries in the US
that lobby Congress and fund
scientific research in order
to effect political change.
However, when more stud-
ies are showing that foods
which are high in sugars and
cholesterol are potentially
addictive, and more hospital
beds are being filled by peo-
ple suffering from the con-
sequences of a high-calorie
diet, questions have to be
asked about the legitimacy
of their practices. Research
on rats at the University of
Wisconsin Medical School,
for instance, has found that
the changes in the rats’ neu-
rochemistry from having a
high-sugar diet were similar
to those inflicted by heroin
and morphine.
Food addiction is an area
that scientists are only just
beginning to explore, but the
signs are not good for the
food industry. McDonald’s
has already been threatened
with legal action accusing it
of promoting bad diets and
selling intrinsically unhealthy
food. Although the first few
lawsuits have been thrown
out, it is only a matter of time
before one ruling in favour
of the customer leads to an
avalanche of lawsuits against
food companies – especially
if further studies confirm
that fatty foods have addic-
tive properties. The fact that
McDonalds are now selling
salads on their menus is a
direct result of this threat
of legal action. But many
think that the damage has
already been done. In the
past 20 years, obesity levels
in American children have
doubled.
Defenders of the food indus-
try would say that unlike
tobacco, food products, by
their very nature, cannot
be intrinsically unhealthy
– since they can always be
incorporated into a balanced
diet. At face value they have
a point, but the consensus
forming in the scientific com-
munity would disagree – for
them, there is not much dif-
ference between smoking
cigarettes and eating junk
food. Both habits are addic-
tive and both can have fatal
consequences.
There is now a community
of people who want to change
the operations of an indus-
try worth $1 trillion and the
dietary habits of a nation of
290 million people. Bona fide
nutritionists want to promote
dietary education in schools,
campaign for food label-
ling, have TV advertising for
unhealthy foods restricted,
taxes levied on soft drinks
and other high-sugar prod-
ucts, and healthy foods like
fruits and vegetables to be
subsidised.
The anti-‘big fat’ legal com-
munity will be looking for the
same kind of success that
tobacco litigators achieved in
1998, when cigarette compa-
nies agreed to pay out $246
billion over 25 years to settle
lawsuits brought by US states
for tobacco-related health-
care costs. Although they are
unlikely to succeed on the
same scale, due to the fun-
damentally poisonous nature
of tobacco constituents,
the anti-‘big fat’ movement
believe that, on the basis of
scientific results, food com-
panies should change their
ways or be punished for their
irresponsible commercialisa-
tion of junk food.
