Where does personal responsibility end
and corporate responsibility begin?
This is the somewhat disturbing
question posed by Super Size Me,
the latest in what seems to be a new
trend of big screen documentaries.
The film follows writer and director
Morgan Spurlock as he embarks on
a month-long diet consisting solely
of McDonalds food. In addition, he
reduces his physical activity to a
minimum in order to mirror that of
an “average” American. The burger
munching, including the obligatory
vomit scene, is interspersed with
examinations by horrified doctors
and personal trainers.
With a synopsis like this, I think
I was justified in my scepticism. I
must admit to having a mental draft
of this article even before buying
the popcorn – in fact I only really
saw Super Size Me so that I could
rip it to shreds effectively. This plan
was somewhat ruined by the film
not actually being as ridiculous as
I expected, so a severe re-draft was
called for.
Don’t get me wrong – the cen-
tral storyline is a daft shock tac-
tic that tells us nothing we don’t
already know. Nobody can seriously
be surprised to hear that Spurlock’s
extreme diet results in dramatic
weight gain, but there are other,
perhaps less obvious effects of the
junk food binge such as depres-
sion, tiredness and lack of sex drive.
Sufferers of these symptoms may
well be surprised to learn that their
diet could be to blame.
Spurlock did not deny that his
experiment was extreme, nor
was the sole point of the film to
demonise the golden arches as I
had expected. In particular there is
a troubling investigation of school
meals in America, where a diet of
chips and fizzy drinks is promot-
ed to an increasingly inactive and
obese youth. Cost is not to blame
– we visit one school that serves up
nutritious meals to its once unruly
students who have been turned
around at least partially by their
improved diet.
McDonalds’ targeting of children
through its marketing inevitably
comes under the spotlight. From
Ronald McDonald to in-store play
areas and the happy meal, it would
be naïve not to realise what they’re
trying to do. Is it morally question-
able? Probably. Does the buck stop
there? I don’t think so – children
will always have wants, be it fast
food, holidays to Disneyworld, toys
(I’m still bitter that I never got a
Mr Frosty), and surely it’s up to the
parents to draw the line somewhere
and say “no”. More importantly,
simply banning our children from
eating junk food is pointless, as one
day they will be old enough to go out
and get it themselves.
What we need to do is educate
our children so that they know why
these things are bad for us – that
goes for smoking, drugs and many
of life’s other evils. Education is
an area highlighted by Spurlock,
with the startling revelation that
not many people even know what a
calorie is.
Top marks must go to the mar-
keting bods at McDonalds for their
response to this attack, which basi-
cally echoes most people’s reaction:
“The film is slick, well-made and
yes, somewhat annoyingly, doesn’t
portray McDonald’s in the most
favourable light. And yet, what we
do agree with is its core argument
– that if you eat too much and do too
little, it’s bad for you.” They have
scrapped the super size option in
America, supposedly for commer-
cial reasons rather than as a result
of this film. I hope that’s the case
– the super size meal is a ridiculous
concept which deserves to fail but
only because nobody would be daft
enough to buy it.
I remain sceptical about the direc-
tor’s reasons for making the film.
The genre is currently dominated
by Michael Moore, the man behind
Bowling for Columbine and the
Bush-bashing Fahrenheit 9/11. Like
him or loathe him, Moore does seem
passionate about what he does. I
can’t help thinking that in this case
Spurlock has spotted an easy buck
in making a “shocking” film that
capitalises on the anti-capitalist
voice of today, at a time when bash-
ing the evil corporations is the new
black. And in no way is this guy the
new Moore – aside from Super Size
Me, Spurlock’s most notable and
recent credit is for MTV gross-out
show I Bet You Will, in which he
persuaded America’s youth to do
humiliating things for cash. It’s like
Jackass, but without the taste and
decency.
What I really have a problem
with is the responsibility question
that introduced both the film and
this article. Where does personal
responsibility end? It doesn’t. At
no point can any of us just switch
off and assume that someone or
something else with deal with the
repercussions of our behaviour.
It’s a lovely idea, and one which
is at the root of many of today’s
problems and certainly the grow-
ing compensation culture – people
have tried and thankfully failed to
sue McDonalds because their food
made them fat.
Corporate responsibility is a nice
theory, but it’s not something we
can realistically expect in our com-
mercial world. If a company of any
size is doing wrong, we have the
right to know. Thanks largely to
the internet, now more than ever
before information is available to
those who want it. And if you have
a problem with the McDonalds or
the Nestlés of this world then by all
means boycott them and do your
best to dent their turnover. In a
free market, it is the consumer that
makes or breaks a company – it’s up
to us to support the good guys and
squeeze out the bad.
Unfortunately this well produced
documentary devalues some impor-
tant points with its ridiculous head-
line-grabbing stunt, and it certainly
hasn’t turned me against the occa-
sional burger for lunch. Perhaps
I’ll have one today, followed by a
coffee at Starbucks. They’d better
not make it with hot water again
– how am I supposed to know it will
burn? Right, get my lawyer on the
phone...

Rotund McDonald: the corporation gets the blame, but is it really their fault if burgers make us fat?
Hello and welcome to a new era
for Felix, the student newspaper of
Imperial College London. For the
benefit of all our freshers, I should
say that Felix is here to inform and
entertain Imperial’s 11,000 students
each week with news, reviews, opin-
ion, puzzles, sports reports and lots
of other interesting stuff as well.
Anyone who has read Felix in the
past will notice that we’ve made a
few changes. The last time it had
pages this size was in 1974 (it’s
been A4 since then), so the decision
to go for a ‘compact newspaper’
format was always going to be a
difficult one. I’m confident that this
will firmly define Felix as a stu-
dent newspaper, rather than lying
somewhere between newspaper
and magazine.
Having consulted previous edi-
tors, it becomes clear that the main
reason why we’ve stuck with A4
for such a long time is because
Felix used to be printed in-house
and the machines couldn’t go any
larger. The majority of respondents
to last term’s survey expressed
a preference for newspaper over
magazine, and we will also save a
certain amount on printing costs,
allowing us to print more pages and
use more colour. Anyway, I hope you
like the new look!
I also want to mention that Felix
will now be released on Thursdays.
I felt that the Friday release meant
that it was often ‘missed’ by some
students until Monday, by which
time the content was already three
days old. Moving it forward should
allow everyone to get hold of a copy
within one day of publication.
Aside from being read by thou-
sands of people each week, Felix
also exists to allow any student to
get involved in running a news-
paper. You can take part in any-
thing and everything we do, and if
you’d like to get involved it would be
great to hear from you – just email
felix@ic.ac.uk or come and see us at
our offices in the West Wing of Beit
Quad (the Union building in South
Kensington). We’re always looking
for new writers, editors, columnists,
designers, reviewers, photogra-
phers... the list goes on. Don’t worry
if you’ve never done anything like
this before – training is available,
and enthusiasm is just as important
as experience.
At the Freshers Fair on Tuesday
5 October, I’ll be at the Felix stand
in the Union Dining Hall, together
with various members of our cur-
rent staff. Come and see us to find
out more about what we do and
how you can get involved. You will
also be able to pick up a copy of the
Imperial College Union Handbook
2004.
By the way, just in case you’re
interested, I have just finished four
years of maths here at Imperial,
and I’m now lucky enough to work
on Felix full time.
I would like to thank all my staff
for their hard work on this, the
first and probably the most difficult
issue of the year. Finally, to anyone
who told me that I’d be working
hard and would probably have to
stay up all night on deadline day: I
know I said it wouldn’t happen, but
you were right. It’s 5am.
