Two years before universities
become able to charge vari-
able fees of up to £3000, a new
poll has found that two thirds
of vice-chancellors are plan-
ning to charge the maximum
amount for every course.
The poll, published in The
Guardian, revealed that the
heads of the majority of uni-
versities in the country have
taken the step of charging
the maximum rate allowed,
with many driven by fears of
appearing second rate and of
having insufficient money to
fund their bursary schemes.
It was originally thought
that universities would
charge differential fees to dis-
tinguish between courses on
the basis of their popularity
or the amount it costs to run
them. Now, as vice-chancel-
lors make the big decision in
time for the 2005 prospectus-
es to go to press, that appears
not to be the case.
It was always known that
ImperialCollegeandtheother
Russell Group universities
(the major research-based
universities in the country)
would charge the full amount.
Sir Richard Sykes, Rector of
Imperial College, told Felix: “I
find it difficult to believe that
an organization of the stand-
ard and quality of Imperial
College would not charge
the maximum £3000 for their
science courses, since even
when we charge £3000 we’re
losing a hell of a lot of money.”
He argues that the maximum
level should be raised higher,
to around £5,000.
Student numbers will not
fall at Russell Group institu-
tions if fees are set at the new
maximum level, such is the
competition for places. It is
the smaller, newer and less
rich universities which face
an agonizing decision about
how much to charge. Charge
less, and they run the risk
of appearing second rate;
charge more, and students
might not think it worth the
cost.
Many universities are find-
ing it difficult to do the maths:
how much are they able to
charge to appear competitive
while being able to fund the
essential bursary schemes
that will also begin in 2006?
This difficult balancing act
has left most seeing no way
out but to charge the maxi-
mum amount. However, a
wrong turn could be disas-
trous – setting the cost too
high could deter students
from enrolling, which could
bankrupt a small university.
Althoughthisnewsisunlike-
ly to affect future Imperial
students, it does suggest that
the idea of ‘choice’ is a mis-
conception: all that appears
to be happening with the
new education marketplace
is that, in essence, fees have
jumped from £1150 to £3000
per year. We are yet to discov-
er whether the bursaries will
provide enough extra income
to allow poorer students to
overcome this, and whether
universities will be able to
attract enough students to
survive.
“It does suggest
that the idea of
‘choice’ is a
misconception”

Student views ignored? Many protested, like these at Imperial in 2002, but tuition fees
look set to reach £3000 for most courses
