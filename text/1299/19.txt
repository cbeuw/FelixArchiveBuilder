CLUB REVIEW
The End is one of London’s best
clubs. Situated in a prime loca-
tion just off Shaftesbury Avenue, it
attracts a certain breed of clubber.
Opened ten years ago by Mr C,
formerly of The Shamen, and Layo
Paskin, one half of progressive tech
house duo Layo & Bushwacka, the
concept behind this place is simple
– a club designed with clubbers in
mind.
What this means is that all the
niggles than could potentially spoil a
night out are sorted. The door policy
is intelligent – there’s no dress code
(except for glam electro night Trash,
on Mondays), so if you’re going with
the sole intention of dancing, feel
free to wear trainers and a T-shirt.
Queue jumping outside is actively
policed by the courteous yet stal-
wart door staff. The sound system is
awesome – different frequencies are
amplified individually and played on
seperate speaker cones, meaning
the music is very loud, yet amaz-
ingly crisp and clear, even if you’re
standing right in front of the speak-
ers.
Usually in clubs, revellers are
forced to refill water bottles from
sinks in the toilets. The toilets in
The End are far too nice for this,
and instead they provide a water
fountain – something very simple
yet almost unique. The DJ booth
in the main room isn’t raised out of
sight of the clubbers – instead it’s
at the perfect level to see exactly
how (and with what records) your
favourite jock is making that amaz-
ing sound. To top it all off, you get a
wristband when you enter, and this
will also allow entry to the adjoining
AKA Bar.
The club has a capacity of around
1000, and different nights may use
the entire space of the club as one
room, or split the lounge bar off
separate from the main dancefloor.
The crowd is one of the things that
draw me to The End – this is where
the bright young things come out to
play. Some people may feel young or
more likely underdressed in com-
parison to everyone else there, but
don’t be put off by this. The End is
full of like-minded people, all there
to enjoy the same music. People
still make the effort to look good,
given that they don’t have to, which
reflects the atmosphere and style of
the place.
The music policy is as impres-
sive as everything else here. There
is variety in the different nights,
from the electo of Trash to drum
and bass with regular Ram Records
and Progression Sessions nights.
At the same time, The End is most
definitely a house club. The type of
house most found here, and which
works best, is tech house - minimal
but to the point, stylish and sexy. It
also sounds amazing over a five way
PA system.
One of the regular house nights
held at The End is ‘As One’ presents
Classic, fronted by Chicago DJ
Derrick Carter (Classic records is
his own label).
Tonight, having spent the day in
the park enjoying South West Four
(see review above), my friends and
I decided to end the night at The
End. On arrival I was pleasantly sur-
prised, as I always am when I come
here. As you enter the club you
arrive in the area bang in between
the lounge and the main dancefloor.
Classic records nights make use of
the lounge and the main floor sepa-
rately, and by the time we arrived,
the man himself, Derrick Carter,
was playing the main room with his
deep, techy sound. In the lounge,
the music was more funky, happy,
soulful house.
After the day’s fun, we were all
pretty knackered, but that was no
problem. We moved straight down to
the best spot in the house – in front
of the DJ booth, where you can see
exactly what he’s up to and hear it
all in the most astounding detail.
Carter’s music is sublime – tough
yet smooth, pounding and insistent
yet warm. His sense of timing and
the finesse and precision of his mix-
ing make for well crafted and well
rounded sets. Listening to him play
and dancing to his beats feels like no
effort at all. It feels like this is how
your body was mde to move.
After a lot of bouncing, twisting
and grooving, once again the not-
so-small hours rolled around, and it
was 7am and sadly time to go home.
This had been the perfect end to
the perfect day, and as we left, the
persistence of one stubborn clubber
said it all, as he insisted to Carter
that he must “do a rewind or play
another record”.

FESTIVAL REVIEW
Summer for any music lover means
festival season. Whatever style’s
your bag, there is sure to be plenty
on offer, and whilst the majority of
the big festivals take place outside of
London (Reading, Glastonbury etc),
there’s almost always something
going on in the city.
Dance festivals are slightly differ-
ent to the usual setup of a weekend’s
camping with music each night –
these things are generally one night
stands, all about the headline DJs
and the variety of music offered
across various stages, tents or are-
nas.
This August I was treated to South
West Four on Clapham Common
courtesy of hard house promoters
Heat UK. This particular dance fest
was an all day affair, starting at mid-
day and continuing into the night,
but was over at 10pm so the crowd
could head off to one of the offi-
cial afterparties or to any one of
London’s smorgasbord of evening
entertainment venues.
The festival had a lot going for it
– 10,000 people, three areas of differ-
ent music, and a big name line-up
including the likes of Eric Morillo,
Xpress-2, as well as Tall Paul, BK,
Rob Tissera and Nick Sentience,
and progressive house don Sasha.
The event had been touted as
Sasha’s only UK outdoor perform-
ance this year, and his sundown set
was part of his tour promoting the
recent Involver mix CD. Considering
that the event was going to be huge
given its urban location, plus the fact
that seeing Sasha in this country is
somewhat of a rarity (even more
so seeing him play outdoors as the
sun goes down, and here he would
be appearing about as close to my
house as possible), it really would
have been rude not to go.
Having already been out the night
before for some bouncy silly fun
at Knowhere at Brixton’s famous
Fridge, I was a little jaded to say
the least, but our crew managed
to make it to Clapham Common by
1pm, by which time the party was
already going in full force. Most of
the 10,000 were already there, and
the arena – made up of the outdoor
Main Stage, plus the much small-
er Heat UK tent with hard house,
and the Bora Bora tent with some
blissful balearic house vibes – was
already looking quite full.
We headed straight for the main
stage, where Eric Morillo was spin-
ning sunny, funky house music to
the crowd who were already moving
and bouncing to the bumping, bub-
bly beats. With warm sun shining
into the shaded eyes of the beauti-
ful people, observing the spectacle
that is thousands of happy people
in the park, all dancing to the same
beat and having the time of their
lives, it would have been hard not to
enjoy myself. And this was only the
beginning.
As the day progressed, we
explored the site a little. The Bora
Bora tent was a heaving mass of
bodies, dancing to amazing music,
but with absolutely no space inside,
we had to enjoy this one outside
from the grass.
The Heat UK arena was slight-
ly bigger and slightly less full, but
faster and with a more heads-down
vibe than the rest of the festival. An
hour or two later, after a tactical
chill-out in the sun, we headed back
to the huge main stage – taking
up a good two thirds of the entire
arena – and got down to the sound
of heavyweight house trio Xpress-2,
who were spinning across no less
than six turntables. The music and
the crowd continued to flow into the
early evening, with progressive stal-
wart Lee Burridge making a sur-
prise, if brief, appearance. There’s
no doubt that part of the atmos-
phere was the anticipation of what
lay ahead: sunset to the sound of
one of the world’s top DJs, Sasha.
Sasha truly is one of the best.
He’s been a firm favourite for years,
with a honed instinct for playing to
a crowd, some of the most uplift-
ing and driving dance music around
coupled with the hottest new tunes,
and an almost unique mixing style.
Greeted by rapturous applause, he
arrived onstage to join Lee Burridge
and commence his set. Sasha’s tech-
nical ability is pretty much unparal-
leled – his technique means he has
the power to build up a crowd, lay a
vast breakdown on them and then
build it all up again, only to drop a
driving, hammering track that quite
literally makes everyone go wild.
His mixes are closer to remixes,
and his sets are seamless. This man
is not “just playing other peoples
records”, he is using them as tools
to fashion a unique musical experi-
ence. How exactly he does this is
hard to say, but mixing ‘in key’ is a
skill that he uses to its full, creating
a musical transition between each
record that fits the progression in
sound. As well as this, effects, loops
and pitch shift can all be thrown into
the cooking pot as part of the recipe
for a big slice of tasty progressive
cake.
Laying down his first track, the
crowd were instantly captivated and
the pace was set for the night ahead.
As the sun arced down to the hori-
zon, we were wowed by an awesome
blend of pounding beats, enveloping
monster bass sounds and bleeping
echoing melodies, with music by the
likes of Way Out West and antipo-
dean artist Luke Chable.
After moving and shaking us
through three hours of top notch
musical entertainment, Sasha’s
set finished and the crowd roared.
This had been a fantastic day, but
the best news was that it wasn’t
over yet. With official afterparties at
Brixton’s George IV and the stylish
Pacha in Victoria, the crowd dis-
persed quickly. We decided to head
uptown to The End, to see Chicago’s
Derrick Carter (see review below),
but had to go home for a brief pit
stop – ten hours of South West Four
had turned us into gibbering wrecks,
but I can’t think of a better way to
spend a sunny summer’s day.
