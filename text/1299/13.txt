Bonjourno and welcome to an all
shiny, bright, brash new year at our
esteemed college.
I believe that whilst most perus-
ing this shall be seasoned read-
ers, I should expect that some will
be fresh faced, polished cheeks
young first years. However, no mat-
ter who you are, I sincerely hope
you’ve had a delightful summer and
let me assure you that this taste-
ful pullout is the accessory to hold
this Freshers Week, especially on
Tuesday, which is the only day that
the information is relevant as it just
so happens to be Freshers Fair.
Imperial College Union supports
over 250 clubs and societies and
you’ll find them all at the fair propped
up behind trestle tables, bawdily
booming out to all and sundry why
thee and thou should join their club.
For whilst Professor Plum will pick-
le your mind with maths, clubs and
societies will bring your dreams to
life. And, dear reader, we have more
pleasures to suit all tastes than any-
one else, from football to finance and
arts to archery et cetera et cetera!
As a rough guide, in the Great
Hall you’ll find the overseas socie-
ties. The Queen’s Lawn is full of
outdoorsy-sporty-type clubs, as
well as all the motoring clubs. The
Main Dining Hall (MDH) is stuffed
with sports clubs and in the Junior
Common Room you’ll find the reli-
gious and ideological societies. The
Sir Alexander Fleming building
is the place for clubs run by the
Medical Students’ Union, and these
are open to all.
Follow the walkway ramp up from
the Queen’s Lawn to the new and
exciting Upper Dalby Court. In this
piazza area next to the blue duplo
lego building, you’ll find the perform-
ance stage where one can catch club
demonstrations from fire juggling to
latin dance along with City & Guilds
and RSM. Across the road at the
Union, there is a plethora of activity!
The stage in Beit Quad will be host-
ing live music. Those of you with an
artistic streak should head for the
Concert Hall, which houses arts and
entertainments. The Union Gym is
jam-packed with social clubs. The
Union Dining Hall will find you face
to face with recreational hobbies
whilst in Beit Quad you’ll find more
adventure clubs than you can shake
a canoe paddle at!
You’re all pretty much spoiled for
choice so don’t waste the opportu-
nity because “all work and no play
makes Jack a dull little boy”.
Anyhoo, enjoy the day, relax, meet
some clubs and take pleasure in
the fact that you’ve got no lectures
because by the weekend you’ll be
running, swimming, playing, jump-
ing, reading, tooting, speaking
debating, singing or whatever with
the nicest bunch of reprobates that
you ever did meet!
