With the beginning of the new
academic year comes a new
group of young and eager
students ready to embark on
a journey that will probably
transform their lives com-
pletely by providing a gate-
way to fun, freedom and even
fortune due to the increased
employability of Imperial
graduates. However, before
we start contemplating buy-
ing an Aston Martin DB9
over a Ferrari Scaglietti, we
need to look at our current
financial state first.
Instead of telling the
reader how to manage their
finances, for which there are
many hundreds of books that
cover the issue in depth, I
will expound the underlying
conditions that determine
the price of one of the most
financially consuming com-
modities for students and lec-
turers alike, namely alcohol.
Although the stages in the
production of alcohol have
changed very little since its
conception many centuries
ago, the price has risen like
there’s no tomorrow. There
are several factors that can
be attributed to this extreme
price change, some of which I
will now outline.
At the forefront of the pric-
ing mechanism is the issue
of alcohol duties. Initially
introduced to assist native
brewers in competing with
much cheaper imported bev-
erages, alcohol duties have
turned out to be a handsome
source of income for Customs
and Excise. Duty rates are
dependent on the alcohol
content of the beverage being
sold and the origin of the
source, with home brewers
being charged much less
than those importing alcohol.
Although there is an array of
different duty rates for spirits
and wines, the rate for beer is
a constant figure, currently
£12.59 per hectolitre per cent
of alcohol in the beer.
The next source of
‘Government funding’ comes
from alcohol taxes, a discreet
yet distinct (from alcohol
duties) contributor to pric-
es. Alcohol tax in the UK is
the highest in the European
Union, bar none. Although it
is not as volatile as alcohol
duty, this tax can be up to a
staggering 70% of the nomi-
nal price you might pay.
However, this Government
scheme has had its desired
effect to some extent. By rock-
eting up the price of beers,
spirits and wines, this policy
has reduced the alcohol con-
sumption level considerably.
Subsequent research has
shown that there has been
a significant decrease in
alcohol intake by youths and
the tax has thus led to fewer
alcohol-related car fatalities,
assaults and health issues.
Location, location, location.
This is one of the few oppor-
tunities where the reader has
some control over how much
he/she pays when it comes
to buying beverages. There
is a huge variation of price
when it comes to alcohol,
ranging from the dirt cheap
booze of parts of Wales to the
ludicrously overpriced spir-
its of the Che restaurant in
Green Park. More often than
not, the alcohol is overpriced
due to the greediness of pub
owners, restaurant manag-
ers and multinational ven-
dors such as SABMiller and
Diageo.
In some respects, the UK
is lucky with regard to the
pricing of alcoholic bever-
ages compared to other EU
nations. Norway’s breweries,
for instance, have been hit
hard by the increasing cost
of alcohol due to their intri-
cate political situation. Also,
inflation has without a doubt
been one of the key factors
underlying the base price of
the whole beverages suite.
From what has been dis-
cussed, it is clear that
Customs and Excise have
no intention of lowering
their income from alcohol,
and the price of beer seems
set to continue to rise with-
out bounds. Combined with
the living costs of South
Kensington and the forth-
coming introduction of top-
up fees, this could have a
devastating effect on student
finances that could leave stu-
dents struggling to get out of
the red for many years after
graduation. With so much
at stake, it is apparent that
there is very little scope for
a student to be drinking on
a night out, let alone go on a
binge at the Che restaurant.
Why a bottle of beer is bound to
bear a burden on a budget
