Much more than a tiny spark
Cult singer-songwriter Brendan Benson returns to the UK for a series of
low-key gigs, but what about the new stuff?
LIVE REVIEW
I knew tonight was going to be spe-
cial; what I didn’t know was how
special it was going to be.
Brendan Benson is a singer-song-
writer from Louisiana whose second
album, Lapalco, which he record-
ed and produced himself, got the
mainstream music press salivating.
Since then, he’s disappeared off the
commercial radar, becoming some-
what of a cult artist among fans of
Ben Kweller and Ben Folds.
Thankfully,aftertwoyears,Benson
has finally pieced together enough
songs to release another record and
has embarked on a low-key, acoustic
tour. He strides onstage, every bit
the lanky American teen (despite
approaching his thirties). Smiling
shyly, he picks the first few chords
to one of Lapalco’s most Beatle-
esque tunes, Good To Me. Within 30
seconds, the Borderline is ringing to
the sound of 200 voices singing.
Brendanlooksincrediblysurprised
by the strength of the response, and
grins nervously. “This one’s a new
one, I know you guys want to hear
old stuff, but you know,” he says,
before launching into a track that’s
easily the equal of anything from his
last two records. Surprisingly, few
arms are crossed, and I look across
to see a gaggle of thirty-somethings
dancing like my dad.
The great thing about the
Borderline is that the capacity is so
small that only dedicated fans can
get in, creating an enviable envi-
ronment for artists to try out their
‘new stuff’. Most of Benson’s set is
superlative, despite most of it being
new – about halfway through the
set is a spectral, impossibly pretty
song that shows just how talented
a songwriter he has become. His
voice now has a colossal range, and
his clear singing allows you to laugh
at his wittily wry lyrics.
Fluffed lines, slightly wonky gui-
tar parts and false starts endear
Brendan to the crowd. It’s good to
see an artist not taking himself too
seriously – after forgetting the lyr-
ics to a song, he laughs and drawls,
“Well, I wrote it 15 years ago!”
Finishing up the set with a half-
speed version of Lapalco’s strongest
track, Tiny Spark, Brendan looks
shocked that the crowd bellow every
single word. I’d even say there was a
little tear in the corner of his eye.
Brendan Benson is a songwriter
at the height of his talents, and from
the sound of tonight, his next record
could be enough to make him the
star he deserves to be.

ALBUM REVIEW
Touring partners Chikinki did it a
few months ago, and now almost a
year after the release of their first
demo, fresh from scoring a top ten
entry in the singles chart, Leicester
quartet Kasabian finally release
their self-titled debut album.
Armed with a host of filthy, beat-
heavy tunes, Kasabian are making
music to simultaneously rock and
dance to. They do it with stacks
of attitude and an underlying sin-
ister tone that will send a shiver
down your spine and back again.
As other British guitar bands tedi-
ously jump on the electronic band-
wagon, there’s just something about
Kasabian that makes you sit up and
take note.
The album is kick-started with a
menacing riff from distorted gui-
tars and a roaring delivery from
vocalist Tom Meighan, making Club
Foot one of the more aggressive
tracks. It leads on to what has to be
Kasabian’s defining moment on the
album – the outrageously bouncy
Processed Beats with baggy beats
reminiscent of the Stone Roses’
Fools Gold. Think Ian Brown on a
pogo stick and you’re not far off the
mark.
ID is a favourite opener at
Kasabian shows and it’s not difficult
to see why, as it opens with chilling,
pulsating electronics before build-
ing up to an anthemic climax. Like
a dark reincarnation of the Happy
Mondays, Cutt Off and recent sin-
gle Lost Souls Forever with their
Shaun Ryder-esque vocals are
funky and eerie at the same time,
whilst Running Battle and Butcher
Blues provide something soulful
for the more chilled Kasabian fan.
The boys clearly love their synthe-
sizers as much as they love their
guitars, and nowhere is this more
evident than on Ovary Stripe which
combines sampled dialogue with a
melody that will leave you unsettled
for days.
The stunning U Boat brings the
album to a poignant close with
haunting vocals, this time provided
by guitarist and keyboardist Sergio
Pizzorno. It’s a perfect conclusion
to what is undeniably a gem of an
album, leaving Kasabian set to kick
the filth back into rock and roll after
the Keanes and Coldplays of the
music world well and truly cleaned
it out.

Free stuff
In accordance with the directions of
the mighty El Editore, we have for
you a little competition. As you may
or may not know, the Felix office
has basically been a huge mess for
as long as I can remember. Well,
it’s now been thoroughly cleared
out and as a result we have a fair
number of CDs and DVDs hanging
around collecting dust.
What CDs, I hear you cry. Well,
we have the Lord Of The Rings,
Shallow Hal and Chopper film
soundtracks; the new Charlatans
album, Up At The Lake; the excel-
lent Seachange album Lay Of The
Land; a new record from Swedish
band The Legends, Up Against The
Legends; and finally, Sugarcult’s
Palm Trees And Powerlines.
That’s not all, no sirree. There are
a few singles as well: The Ordinary
Boys’ rowdy singalong Week In
Week Out, complete with special
edition packaging; Amplifier’s Neon
single; and Razorlight’s ubiquitous
Golden Touch.
Last, but not least, we have two
promotional DVDs to give away. The
first is Far East Man, a live DVD of
a Ronnie Wood gig in London, fea-
turing classic Stones tracks as well
as few famous covers. The other
is a Katy Rose DVD, a young and
upcoming songwriter.
To win all this, you need to email
music.felix@ic.ac.uk with the
answer to this question: What’s the
name of the new Thrills album?
Don’t forget to tell us your name!
Editorial ramblings
Hello my dear friends, ‘tis your erst-
while music editor-type person wel-
coming you to this wonderful first
issue of Felix.
First off, let me welcome all you
freshers that are probably attempt-
ing to soothe your hangover and
trying to remember what the hell
happened to the last 12 hours. We’ve
all been there. For the rest of you,
welcome back to another year of
borderline insanity and overwork.
Felix now has a new editor and
a new look. The newspaper format
now gives all of us section editors
masses of room to play with, so
look forward to lots more features,
including regular competitions and
a more diverse selection of reviews.
Anyhoo, all this extra space means
we need reviewers. Lots of ‘em. We
have plenty of contacts with pro-
motion companies, and these love-
ly folks provide us with loads of
free CDs, normally before they are
released in the UK. You come along
to a meeting in the bar, sit and
chat with your fellow music-loving
reviewers, take a few CDs, listen to
them and send me a review. There’s
no experience required; I’d never
written in my life when I joined up
in the first year.
As if getting free albums and sin-
gles wasn’t enough, we also get
free tickets and guestlist places to
a huge number of gigs in London.
We’ve had tickets to see The Thrills
at Abbey Road Studios, Coldplay
at Earl’s Court, and those are just
the big ones. All you need to do is
provide me with your email address,
and I mail out a list weekly or twice
weekly with listings. You choose
what you want to go to, I give you
tickets, you review it.
Sounds great, right? We try to
be as diverse as possible, so if the
things I’ve mentioned seem a bit too
mainstream for you, you should still
come along – we have great contacts
with a lot of independent labels and
promotion companies.
If you’re interested, I’ll be on the
Felix stand in the Union Dining
Hall at the Freshers Fair so you
can join up. Alternatively, you can
email me at music.felix@ic.ac.uk, or
come to the first meeting of term on
Thursday 7 October in dBs.
