Paintballing
Welcome to the heady world of paintballing-
the fastest growing sport in Europe. Paintball
is the ultimate adrenaline rush and this article
is the ultimate guide to getting you started. In
brief, it is most like a grown up version of
cops and robbers or cowboys and Indians. The
players are normally split up into two teams
and the idea is to mark the opposition with
paintballs fired from a gun (paintball marker).
Their effective range is about thirty yards,
with a fair degree of accuracy.
Depending on
the site, you may
be playing in
woodland, with
streams and lakes.
A l t e r n a t i v e l y ,
some venues have
an urban setting,
with specially
adapted buildings
and surroundings.
The games tends
to differ from site
to site, but you
may be playing a
normal two flag
game, where the
objective is to cap-
ture the opposi-
tions flag and
return it to your
base, while at the
same time stopping the other team doing the
same to your flag. Whatever the game, the
outcome relies greatly on your tactics and
cunning or your complete disregard for cau-
tion and a mad dash for the flag under a hail
of paint.
Does it hurt? This is one of the most
common question we get asked (after "How
much does it cost?"]. The answer is, if you are
wearing sensible clothing - a jumper and
tracksuit trousers under the overalls which
are supplied then, no. Paintball injuries tend
to fall into the sprains and bruises category.
However, to uphold this excellent reputation
safety is the key word at all sites. On arrival
you will be issued with a set of industry stan-
dard goggles before you even see a paintball
gun. These goggles should become your best
friend, unless in the specified 'safe zone' you
should be wearing your goggles at all times.
How much will it cost? Paintball can be a
relatively expensive sport. However, ICU's
paintball club has excellent contacts with
sites, which allow us to negotiate prices that
are substantially cheaper than the normal.
During a typical day, which involves 8-10
games, we expect average first time players to
spend around £30. This estimation includes
the site 'green fee' which contributes to the
upkeep of the site, rental of protective gog-
gles, overalls, gun (and gas to power it) and
paint.
If you are interested
in taking your
friends into the
woods and shooting
them, then contact
either myself,
Warren Hirst
(email: w.hirst@ic'.
ac.uk) or Richard
Swinford (r.swin-
ford@ic.ac.uk).
We have provisional-
ly planned the next
trip to be on 16th or
17th of March. It
will be to 'Hot
Shots', who are
based at R A F
Greenham Common
- a spectacular site
with superb facili-
ties. The playing zone has over 100 two story
buildings to play in and around. A l l glass has
been removed to allow you to jump in and
out of windows (there are doorways, for the
less energetic), staircases allow access to
upper levels and these are notoriously hard to
capture.
Please contact us by e-mail if you are
interested and we can get more details back
to you. Enquiries from anyone are welcome,
however, remember it is a lot more fun to go
paintballing with your friends so drag them
along. W e are happy to be joined by other
societies, departments and halls who are
looking for something different to do.
Keep low, shoot straight and may your
balls burst on impact.
