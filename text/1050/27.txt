'Storming'
Ladies
ICWFC 1 2 - 0 UCL I
Once again the Imperial College
Ladies sent their opposition
home empty handed following a
scintillating display ol fitness
and skill. Despite being down to
f) men, (Schwa'' - Sports Ed.) the
IC girls reduced the U C L
defence to sieve status.
Shockingly, the First half
remained scoreless.
The second half saw Helen
showing off her brilliant individ-
ual skills, in a move which saw
the ball ending up in the back of
the U C L net.Owing to sheer
luck and a terrible shot U C L
missed a penalty, and from this
point on the IC defence
remained solid. After somecon-
fusion in the U C L box,
Mamamia Eva used brute force
to power the ball over the line
following a shot from Juliette.
We're Going To Barbados, You're Not!
( B u t P l e a s e G i v e U s Y o u r M o n e y A n y w a y )
Please understand we don't
want no trouble...
After many months of random
shooting in the dark, we finally
hit our target this term with a
cheeky collaboration of the hock-
ey and football clubs.
This provided the neces-
sary impetus for what has
the potential to be one of
the finest sports tours
ever; Barbados '96.
Forty of IC's most
responsible football and
hockey athletes will be
gracing the island of
Barbados this August,
comprising of three
squads; Ladies hockey,
men's hockey and men's football.
The hockey teams will be partic-
ipating in the 'Barbados Hockey
Federation' tournament and the
footballers will be playing several
w
1
friendly fixtures against the
University of the West Indies
and the Barbados Community
College.
After booking half an aero-
plane to the West Indies it was
•
clear that we've now split the
defence and only have the goalie
to beat. Its a one on one situation
with our fund-raising events just
needing the ever vital crowd sup-
port. The tour is ambitious but
with a drop of the shoulder and a
bit of a shimmy we reckon we
can taste a little paradise.
For fund-raising events we
have organised a varied and excit-
ing repertoire; A n open
pool tournament for all
students, a sponsored
head shave (girls includ-
ed), a sports dinner for
representatives from
every sports club, a
naked bungee jump, an
open 6-a-Side football
competition and many
glorious raffles.
Let's face it we're going
nowhere without your
support, and the last thing we
want is empty terraces. So if you
spot one of our events, turn up
and spare us some loose change
or pretend you've got no money.
