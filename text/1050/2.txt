ULU constitution debated
BY ALEX FEAKES
The University of London
Union's constitution became a
subject of heated discussion at
ICU Council meeting on
Monday evening. Ghassan
Karian, President ol U L U , was
invited to the meeting to talk on
the four month review of the
constitution.
In his speech, Mr Karian said
that the recent Education Act
which reformed the structure of
student unions, and pressure to
make the Union more account-
able were the main driving forces
behind the review. The U L U ini-
tiated a consultation process
which began in September, and
is now reaching its conclusion
with ratification by the student
unions of the University.
The main changes from the
old constitution involve repre-
sentation of the medical schools
and the proposal to introduce a
new Sports and Societies sabbat-
ical post. The medical schools are
currently grouped together as
"Med Group" and send 20-30
delegates to the General Union
Council of U L U but the mergers
between medical schools and col-
leges brought about by the
Tomlinson report have changed
this.
Under the new rules,
London's medical schools togeth-
er have only 4 delegates to the
Senate between them. Some
medics have said that this means
that they will have less represen-
tation on the new body. One
council member suggested that
the fact that the medical schools
will still send delegates to G U C
separately from their parent col-
leges was just "half-cocked
appeasement", defeating the aim
of the integration of the medical
schools. M r Karian said that
there would be another review in
five years time.
The Sports and Societies
sabbatical post was proposed as a
solution to the conflict of inter-
est between the Sports Council
President and the V P for Sports
and Recreation. The two posi-
tions will be merged to form the
new post with the aim of improv-
ing efficiency.
A motion to implement the
new document, sponsored by
U L U V P Tara Jefferson, was
approved by Council.

Southside robber
charged
The burglar apprehended in the
Southside Halls two weeks ago as
reported in Felix 1048, has been
charged by the police on three
counts of burglary. The name of
the burglar has not been released
yet, though he is believed to be
from the London area.
IC's Deputy Head of
Security, Kenneth Weir, still has
some property in his possession
recovered at the time of the bur-
glary, for which no owner has
come forward. If you lost a large
men's suit at the time of the
thefts, M r Weir at the security
control in Sherfield will be
pleased to help you.
A Measure of Mary's
A ground breaking appearance of
St Mary's Dramatic Society at
ICU next week has raised hopes
of more cooperation between
Mary's and IC. Shakespeare's
play Measure for Measure is cur-
rently being shown at St Mary's
Union. The production is being
brought over to South
Kensington for performances on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Marines play at the
Albert Hall
The Albert Hall was taken over
by the massed bands of Her
Majesty's Royal Marines this
week as they presented the
Mountbatten Festival of Music
1996 in aid of charity. Security
was tight, however, with several
roads closed to parking and the
area patrolled by police all week.
Physics computer chips
stolen
The Physics department was the
victim of yet another computer
hardware robbery over the week-
end. A.selection of memory chips
were taken from personal com-
puters in a fourth floor teaching
laboratory.
Security believe that the
thief 'piggy-backed' in to the
building behind a legitimate user
of the department, and urged
students and staff alike to be
aware of this method of entry by
criminals.
'Drop-in' students get
Â£450 fine
Two geology students called to
Union disciplinary after breaking
into I C U Print Unit earlier this
month have been charged with
the cost of the damage they
catised.
Last Friday's meeting also
banned from entering the Union
premises for the rest of this
term. The IC band Herb had to
pull out of the Jazz, Rock and
Ents . Friday night rock
"Abandon" on finding that one of
their member was no longer
allowed in the building.
Senior Union sources have
expressed disappointment that
the punishment was too lenient.
New life found on
Earth
Researchers in America
announced this week that they
have discovered a new type of
lifeform, distinct from all others.
The work in Wyoming's
Yellowstone National Park con-
centrated on the genetic differ-
ences between various microbes,
utilising recent advances in struc-
tural molecular biology. This has
meant that microbes that are
outwardly similar in structure
have been revealed to be some-
what different at a genetic level.
The discoverer of these new life-
forms claims that it will revolu-
tionise the way scientists classify
species.
On a related note, builders
in Romania have uncovered a
cave containing 31 new species.
The cave was originally under
water, but became separated
when the Black Sea water level
fell. Inside the cave, there has
been no sunlight for 5 million
years, and the creatures have
established an alternate food
chain exclusive of photosynthe-
sis. Scientists have established
that all the energy for the ecosys-
tem originates from when bacte-
ria oxidise the hydrogen sulphide
abundant in the cave.
