dence" in the intentions of
nationalists: "there has to be con-
fidence that the ceasefires are
real". Both the British and Irish
governments have stated that
they will not meet with Sinn Fein
until the IRA reinstate the cease-
fire that was broken on Friday
after seventeen months. In
response to the continuing
demands of Sinn Fein to be
immediately included in all-party
talks, Sir Patrick said that "we
share that desire", but that
democratic talks are impossible
with the threat of violence: "no
one can have a gun under the
table or a gun outside the door".
He went on to outline the
state of the Northern Ireland
peace process, and the position of
the government and other parties
on the continuationof the process
in the light of the IRA's resump-
tion of violence. He restated the
government's aims for the
process: "we are about trying to
help., achieve a lasting settle-
ment", saying that any settlement
was "not to be imposed [and
must be | founded on consent".
The minister attacked
reports from nationalists that the
government had ignored the con-
clusions of the Mitchell report on
the future of the process, saying
they were simply "not true". The
government had accepted all six

Two of the contests for next
year's I C U sabbatical positions
look set to he straight one-horse
races. A third is dependant on
one candidate obtaining most of
his quota of seconders' signatures
in the final 24 hours before
papers come down.
Piers Williams, Pub Board
chairman and 'publicity and pro-
motions' secretary for STOIC, is
the only person standing for the
position of Deputy President
(Finance and Services). Similarly,
Alex Feakes, news editor of Felix
and ex-joint editor of the Royal
College of Science Union maga-
recommendations in the report,
he said, and pointed out the sec-
tion calling for all parties to sign
up to the principle of democratic
methods. The report also con-
cluded that the IRA was not
going to accede to government
demands that it decommission
weapons before joining talks, and
suggested that talks start before
decommissioning.
The process hit problems
last week when the government
gave support to the Unionist pro-
posal of holding elections in
Ulster leading to all-party talks.
Sir Patrick said the intention of
this plan was to "enable all parties
to have a democratic mandate."
He finished by telling of the Irish
people's horror at the prospect of
a return to violence, saying that
the terrorists "live in a kind of
rock pool", and that 17 months of
peace had "reduced their support
to a minuscule level."
The minister then opened
the floor to questions from the
audience. O n being asked about
decommissioning of paramilitary
weapons and how to measure the
stability of any return to the
ceasefires, he said "of course
[decommissioning] remains the
best [path]". He agreed with the
assertion that the ceasefires
should include a ban on punish-
ment beatings", forced expulsions
and other crimes the paramili-
zine Broadsheet, faces only New
Election as his bid to edit Felix
next year.
Although two students have
signed up for the position of
Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies), James Handley only
had seven seconders' signatures
as Felix went to press. Each can-
dadate needs to have twenty sec-
onders to be eligible to run. His
opponent, Neil O'Shaughnessy,
has been fully backed.
The position of I C U
President is the only one that
might be more hotly contested.
In the past week, Eric Allsop, the
present I C U Council Chair, and
taries have continued to commit-
throughout the ceasefire: "we
have not had a true peace." He
asserted that the activities had as
much political purpose as the
bombing campaign, intending to
"subvert the R U C " and "tell the
people the IRA are in charge".
The spectre of a return to
the use of internment of terrorist
suspects without trial was raised
by Ian Bayley, who suggested that
the policy could be acceptable to
the people of Ireland if it was
operated by some sort of Anglo-
Irish body, representing all sides
of the community. Sir Patrick
commented "every country has
[provisions in the legislature] for
internment", intended to be used
"as a matter of last resort."
The British power comes
under the terms of the
Emergency Provisions Act, which
is up for renewal by Parliament in
the near future. The Labour party
has previously stated its opposi-
tion to keeping the power of
internment within the act, but
the government is adamant. Sir
Patrick said "it is necessary as a
matter of prudence to keep that
power", adding "I feel very
strongly [that it should remain an
option]". He also praised the
Labour Party's "staunch support
for the government", insisting
that no party would risk peace for
party political reasons.
Ents DJ Luke Moralis have put
forward their candidacies. Only
Eric Allsop has the requisite sup-
port in the bag: Luke needs fur-
ther seconders names, while
Mark Bridge, who signed up on
Monday February 5th, is still
hunting for a proposer.
Tim Townend, the current
Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies) commented: "It looks
like it's all going to be very boring
this year."
Union officials are also con-
cerned that the elections will see
a very low turnout of voters when
they are held on March 4th and
5th. Students must be in posse-
Sir Patrick became uncom-
fortable only once during the
questioning, looking agitated on
the subject of last Friday's bomb
at Canary Wharf. A member of
the audience asked whether he
thought that the leadership of
Sinn Fein had prior knowledge of
the docklands bombing. Sir
Patrick replied he was "unable to
answer that", since the leadership
themselves were the ones to ask.
When pressed for his own opin-
ions, he stated firmly: "I don't
want to share my personal view."
He instead reminded the
audience of a widely reported
incident last year, when the Sinn
Fein president Gerry Adams was
addressing a party rally, and
responded to a shout from the
crowd of "Bring back the IRA"
with "They haven't gone away,
you know." One member of the
audience took exception to this,
shouting out: "That was out of
context and you know it." Sir
Patrick replied staunchly:
"Perhaps the context was the
context of last Friday."
The gathering ended on a
note of mild confusion. As the
audience prepared to leave, a
member of the Conservative
Society informed the minister
that a bottle of whisky adjacent
to the podium, which he had
assumed to be a gift, was merely
to be autographed and returned.

be eligible to vote, but little more
than 50% of students have one.
In recent years, the Imperial
College Union membership ID
came as part of the college secu-
rity swipe card, so every student
was automatically issued with
one. Separate I C U membership
cards have been issued this year
in an attempt to remove some of
the technical problems associated
with using magnetic swipe cards
to register votes.
The 'new election' campaign
will be run by the current Deputy
Presidents. The position is open
for all posts.
