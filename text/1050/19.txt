theatre: an ideal
husbandlaire samuel
This revival of Peter Hall's 1993 production of
An Ideal Husband is now playing in the theatre
in which it was premiered, just over 100 years
ago, on 3rd January 1895. At the same, time,
another of Wilde's plays, 'The Importance of
Being Earnest' was also playing in the West End,
to similar acclaim. Only a few months later both
had closed, and Wilde was sentenced to two
years imprisonment with hard labour.
Taken to be the author's most autobio-
graphical work, An Ideal Husband portrays the
Wildean figure of Lord Goring (Martin Shaw) as
the oldest friend and confidante of the M P Sir
Robert Chiltern (David Yelland), who is being
blackmailed by Mrs Chaveley (Anna Carteret).
The play has hardly dated over the past century:
Wilde's accurate observation of the behaviour of
relatives, politicians and the scurrilous nature of
the Press is just as applicable today.
Wilde preferred his play to be described as
a simple story of a lost bracelet, with its major
theme being the difference between the ideals
and needs of men's and women's love. It is the
only area which nowadays may not be consid-
ered to be politically correct.
A very well-padded Martin Shaw as the
dandy Lord Goring steals the show. Not only
does he have the best lines, but with his extrav-
agant cravats and button holes he is Oscar Wilde
reincarnate, either lounging casually on a chaise
longue or clashing from pillar to post attempting
to prevent his friend's downfall. He is excellent-
ly supported by a superb cast, on a very simple
open stage which still manages to convey the
opulence of the Victorian Mayfair setting.
As in any of Wilde's social comedies, we are
not short of laughs, but the sympathetic direc-
tion instils a new poignancy to the increasingly
strained relations between Sir Robert and his
wife (Penny Downie), making a truly delightful
production.
-theatre: Stanleyalso claire
Pam Gems, currently the only British female
playwright showing in the West End, has written
a stunning play of jealousy, greed seduction and
spiritualism on the life of the English artist
Stanley Spencer.
Like his contemporary at the Slade, Dora
Carrington, his was a life of unconventional rela-
tionships, but fulfilled with true love. But unlike
Carrington and the Bloomsbury set, who he fre-
quently condemned as paintingforfashion and
from the mind, Spencer always paintedfromthe
heart. To him, paint-
ing was an emotion-
al and spiritual
experience, enabling
him to express his
God given talent in
an English style of
religious art. The set
reflects his strong
religious beliefs by
surrounding the
auditorium in
Spencer's canvasses,
which are strongly reminiscent of church fres-
coes.
Spencer (Antony Sher), in his round glasses
and scuffed shoes is, even with his artistic matu-
rity, emotionally just a boy. Unable to come to
terms with his experiences in the trenches of
WWI, he is brutally honest with his wife
(Deborah Findlay), whom he treats almost
maternally, showing resentment at the loss of
attention he suffers when their children are
bom.
Patricia Preece is the tall, elegant, upper
class artist, the complete opposite to Stanley and
his wife, who seduces Spencer purelyforhis
influence and money. Such is the power of her
hold over him, Preece with her own childlike
outlook of superficial beauty, convinces him to
divorce his wife, marry her as well as signing over
the house to provide her with an income, but
once married preferring to remain with her lover,
Dorothy Hepworth (Selina Cadell). Whether
Preece was quite as
calculating, hedonis-
tic and narcissistic in
real life as depicted
here, we are not sure,
but Anna Chancellor
portrays her with
such conviction that
at the end one is not
sure whether to
applaud her, such is
the hatred she
inspires.
This is an unusual love story: with the part
of Stanley written for Antony Sher, he brings a
realism to the role since he is an artist too, and
his honesty brings some engaging comic
moments. On leaving though, one is left with a
feeling of optimism that even after all he suf-
fered, somehow he could still be at peace with
himself and his god.
