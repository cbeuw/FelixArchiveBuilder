Next week Felix will print the manifestos of this year's can-
didates. To prepare you, we interviewed the current sabbs
to see if they stuck to their plans.
Tim Townend
Reading Tim Townend's manifesto with a
year's hindsight, his promises seem
courageously precise. Here is a man
who pinned his colours to the mast, and
in his own inimitable style he has a insis-
tent answer for every question.
RW: So have you promoted and encour-
aged the arts societies?
TT: No one's prepared to get off their
arses: I've been working hard on getting
sponsorship for SCAB [the social and
cultural amusements boarcl.1, but it's
taking some time... they have a much
lower purchasing power than the rest.
RW: So what the sports clubs: you said
you would obtain a high level of coach-
ing in all of them?
TT: All the major sports clubs have the
option of coaching (he reams off a list
from hockey and rugby to table tennis)
RW: And what about 'extending and uni-
fying recreational resources'?
TT: Hmm... it's proving very hard...
RW: And extending clubs' social links?
TT: It's difficult to get people to organise
things...
Here follows sizeable exegesis on poster
boards and refurbishing the SCR into a
clubs and socs room. It all sounds fairly
impressive.
RW: So then, overall, do you think you're
doing a good job?
TT: Is that the end of my manifesto?
RW: Yeah, we've gone through all your
points...
TT: But what about sponsorship?
RW: umm...
TT: Shit! 1 didn't even put it in! Yeah!
Sponsorship's gone really well....
I hope people don't take things too
badly, but basically, the way things are
structured, sabs, spend too much time
in day to day running rather than imple-
menting new ideas. That's the way in all
these incidences, I've only gone halfway,
and I don't suppose I'll get anything fin-
ished.
Matt Crompton
MC: [reading manifesto] Yes we do
keep prices down, I do that at every
committee that we do. DaVinci's for
example, food is actually cheaper now -
there's the £1 thing.
MB: Was that your idea then
MC: Not expressly my idea but I backed
it fully. I argued against some prices
rises too, we've kept all of the prices
down as much as we could.
We haven't move to Sherfield, we're now
looking at much better plans to try and
expand and improve existing facilities
over here. The Ents lounge is a priority at
the moment. We plan to do something
with that over the summer, but there's
various other things as well, such as the
clubs and societies room.
Yes, I think I've done a good job. Shame
I was ill though, that really buggered
everything up this term. It means I now
do 15 hour days.
MB: So don't get ill then
MC: Yes, don't you dare get ill. But who-
ever stands should expect, I did anyway,
especially at this time of year, to be
working all hours. Although perhaps not
as much as I do now. That's life I sup-
pose.
MB: It must be strange, just getting to
grips with the job then watching all these
new people getting ready.
MC: I'm looking forward to the Mary's
hustings actually, to see other people

get flanned. Everyone who goes the
Mary's hustings to speak should wear
white tops, so the shaving foam doesn't
show up so much.
MB: Thanks!
Sarah White
SW: Well what did I actually say I was
going to do though? I can't see anything
there, [reading from manifesto] 'I'm
enthusiastic' No, I'm not totally enthusi-
astic. I am enthusiastic most of the
time. I'm very determined. ... It didn't
really say anything.
MB: A good exercise in not saying any-
thing then.
SW: My mum helped me write it, she's
very good at things like that.
Rachel Walters
Rachel, being a writer by nature, reeled
off the following self analysis without let-
ting me get a question in. Make of it
what you will.
RW: Well, I think I've done a reasonable
amount of it. The big thing I wanted to
do was to expand the coverage of what
was happening in college and to try and
to have a better level of communication
between different groups of people that
are here, and have a more representa-
tive basis of the sort of things that go on,
not only at Imperial but also nationwide.
I think we've done that. I've made a big
effort to improve contact with the people
that actually make decisions about
Imperial at a time that's quite crucial,
with big changes. So I think I've done
that well. It's something I guess I
focussed on.
Other stuff, like sport and stuff... it's so
ironic, because I based my manifesto
around things that people said to me
when I asked them, before I actually got
here, when actually I had time to ask
people what they thought. They would
say things like "oh, you know we really
like the sport pages, we think it's really
important to keep up to date with how
the sports teams are doing.". But when
it comes down to it, my hands are com-
pletely tied, because I can't go to every
fixture and write a report for them, and if
people don't deliver the goods, there's
very little you can do. And I guess I feel
that's probably the most frustrating thing
about it.
People here are quite keen to react,
usually negatively, but are much more
loathe to actually contribute. When I say
contribute I'm not expecting everyone to
drop everything and rush and write a six
page epic. You know, contribute their
ideas, make suggestions, say "this is
what I think would be good", and people
just don't do that. It is quite difficult.
I feel slightly proud of the Mary's thing.
Everybody says every year "I'll try and
improve relations with Mary's" and I
think I've done that. The fact that I've
got a news reporter who's a Mary's stu-
dent, who's really keen and rushes over,
and that was something that was really
important to me. We've had an awful lot
more news coverage of things that've
been happening over there.
The other thing I talked about was Clubs
and Societies. Well yeah, I think a lot of
that stuff tends to only appeal to the
individuals involved. I think by spreading
it out more, making it much more a
week ahead - what's going on at
Imperial thing, it makes it less of a cou-
ple of pages to flick through. Yeah, I
think that's improved a little. I wouldn't
for one moment suggest it was an
unmitigated success at all. I'm reason-
ably happy with things.
