The m ics are a Swedish band that regular
readers©! these sacred pages must have heard of.
Their third album, 'Be A Girl', was unnoticed by
many &eners, a fact that has left the band feel?
ing justly /frustrated since, the album gives a
refreshing view of* how pleasant music can be
minus the obvious manufacturing process of
pop. - 1

various: the best...album in

It is not entirely clear why the producers felt the
need to put two sets of ellipses in the title - the
implication seems to be that they've left some-
thing out. Perhaps "The Best...01e' Favourites...
Album In The World... But It Won't Go Down
Well With Those Who Don't Appreciate
Britpop... Ever" was deemed to be a little too
wordy to fit on the C D cover.
This is the compilation for anyone who has
been asleep for the past year. We've got them all
here - 'Country House', 'Wonderwall' and
'Common People' ; Radiohead, Cast, Sleeper,
Ash and Elastica... But they've managed to sprin-
kle in a couple of sporadic bits of the Eighties, too,
including The Smiths, New Order and The Stone
Roses. It's all so familiar and the music has
become its own rip-off; The Lightening Seeds
Life of Riley has become that jingle they play over
the football results; Wonderwall is simply that
Mike Flowers Pops song.
Still, it's a bit of an epic - it's been in the office
. and played and played and overplayed and we still
laugh at Morrisey's "you go home and you cry and
you want to die" and people start jumping up and
down whenever Parklife' comes on. You simply
cannot listen to 'The Size Of A Cow' without
starting to sing along, even though Bjork's excep-
tionally imtating 'It's Oh So Quiet' is beginning
to grate.
It's not exactly innovative, and you could be
forgiven for saying that much of this two C D set
is getting a little bit tired. But there are far fewer
duff numbers than you would normally expect to
find padding this kind of compilation, and for late
night have a few beers and sing-a-long-a-Blur ses-
sions, this is really superb.
