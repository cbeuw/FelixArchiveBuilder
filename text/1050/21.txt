Grim weather forecasts certainly'didn't deter
the fell-wanderers from visiting the Brecon
Beacons, the walking was superb. Getting
wet was the order of the day for Saturday,
with a snowball fight, and the Sgwd yr Elra
waterfall was impressive, although we were
disappointed when the Rocking Stone didn't
rock.
On Sunday, the club headed for the
mountains to conquer Pen y Fan. The biting
wind did little to spoil the amazing view at
the top, and the weather improved sufficient-
ly to allow a spot of sunbathing during lunch.
As the walk ended a snow covered path
enabled those with a sense of adventure to
complete the descent on their backsides.
Get out of here! the Youth Hostelling
Association meets on Thursdays at l p m in
Southside.
