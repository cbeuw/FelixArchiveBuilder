Virgins Fail To Score On
\ / I i â€¢ / | - N (But make up
Valentine s Day fir*in the bar
later...)
P O R T S M O U T H 55-0 V I R G I N S
A virginal score on Valentine's
Day didn't reflect the hard work
and commitment that was evi-
dent in every players perfor-
mance.
Against the wrath of the
Pompey forwards and the speed
and quick wits ol their backs, a
makeshift IC V X tried and tried
but couldn't quite score. The
award for back of the match goes
to Becky who stood in at scrum
half following an injury to the
captain after twenty minutes.
Jane gets the vote for forward of
the match for taking a lot of dirty
tactics on the chin, whilst Sarah
gets loudmouth of the match for
obvious reasons. Well done
Virgins, who played proudly in a
difficult match.
(Sarah W reckons that being
complimented by the england
student hooker leading a pack
full of internationals is worth a
mention to all those involved. So
here it is.)

(3 - 7 A E T )
With buoyant fans, IC's women
set foot on Welsh (astro) turf on
Monday. Despite some superb
attacking play, IC were 2-0
down at half time. The second
half, though, showed our ladies'
determination, in pulling a goal
back through a Joke penalty cor-
ner, only to find themselves two
goals behind once more. IC
fought back though, with
tremendous strikes from Joke
and Sally, which exemplified
IC's team approach to the game.
Extra time was required, but
from then on there could only
be one winner. Bring on Exeter!

IC III 2 - 0 RHUL III
In somewhat of a renais-
sance for the sport, the 3rds won
a game!
Progressing in fine style into
the last sixteen of the BUSA
championships, their grandiose
performance was eclipsed only
by the Cantona-esque bad
sportsmanship of the R H U L
goalkeeper. Two fine strikes led
to goals from Apeman and
Butlins .Even without Ken, there
was no doubt that on the day we
were the best. The cost of the
match was 5000 pounds.
Obituary to Ken:
Our Ken, who art in heaven
Hockey was thy game
Thy goalposts come
And enemies done
On pitch as well as bar
Give us this day our monthly
goal
And forgive us our passes
As we let in those goals scored
against us
And lead us not into relega-
tion
But deliver us from defeat
For thine are the goalposts
And the spirit
And the humiliation
Forever and ever
Aken.

Difficult Win
SOAS 7 - 1 2 ICRFC
Having donated two of their
players to the opposition IC had
a close win over the SOAS.
IC took the lead early on
with a highly logical run by Julian
Harrison from well inside his
own 22. His try was met with a
model conversion from Andy
Mayes.
Although IC's forwards
dominated the set-pieces, the
game was scrappy overall, with
many opportunities missed by
both sides.
A score from John Evans,
masquerading as a scrum half,
settled the contest and although
SOAS scored a late try, IC were
victorious.

5TH LEAGUE RACE:
WOMEN 1ST, MEN 3RD
The conditions were atrocious,
the mud was knee deep in the
best of places, but everything
was alright because Jurgen for-
got his lurid pink tights.
As for the race, Gerald ran
with his shoes in his hands,
whilst Gary got into the spirit of
Valentine's Day by running with
a rose between his teeth. The
women won the league and went
to the pub to celebrate. The men
went to the pub anyway.
Anyone who would like to
marshal the Hyde Park relays on
Saturday, meet at 12.30 at the
Union. You'll get a free t-shirt
(and a look at Jurgen's pants.)
The party in the union afterward
is sure to be a huge hit (rave on
