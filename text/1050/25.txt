FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 1 6TH 1 9 9 6 . TWENTY-FIVE
LETTER T O I C U : REPLIED T O BY I C U STAFF
Dear I C U ,
The propaganda accompanying
the calls lor comments about the
Union in recent issues of Felix
were very reassuring - how nice
to see a body so concerned with
the welfare of students, providing
services at affordable prices and
an unmissable Ents. programme.
What a shame that they did not
paint a fully balanced picture.
When compared to those of
other universities, such as
Manchester, Cardiff and Birm-
ingham, the facilities in our union
are extremely poor. While
Imperial may be a relatively small
university, the union does not
match up even to that of similar
sized universities, such as Hull. I
fully agree with Rachel Walters'
comments in the editorial of Jan.
19th on the state of the union's
facilities, while the proportion of
students regularly using the
building in the evenings may be
quite low, a capacity of around
500 on most nights hardly
enables access for all, as demon-
strated by the queues regularly
seen outside the Quad. I am
aware that this capacity is being
slightly increased, but this will do
little to ease the frustration of
people having to wait outside.
Such frustration is not calmed by
the holier-than-thou and general-
ly arrogant attitude displayed by
the majority of Stewards.
The union is the only one I
know of (and I have visited
around thirty different unions in
the past couple of years) not to
have any pool tables available.
The bar facilities arc undeniably
inadequate for their purpose. It is
quite unbelievable that we should
have two small bar areas, even
with the seating in Da Vinci's
being inconveniently removed,
both of which are served by
insufficient bar length and staff.
Perhaps more frustrating to most
people is the service offered at
the bars and food counters. There
seems to be some inability to
keep all the beers in the Union
Bar on tap throughout a week,
not to mention at the right tem-
perature (and water content, it
seems?]. I cannot understand
why the bar continues to sell cig-
arettes but no cigars, despite
repeated requests made to the
staff - I know of many people
who would enjoy such a service.
The bars' shortcomings real-
ly pale into insignificance when
one considers the Da Vinci's food
counters. Quite apart from the
food itself, which is, at best,
somewhat like the curate's egg, it
is the running of the outlet that is
infuriating. It is all too frequent
for certain foods to run out even
by l p m , especially potatoes and
bread. What use is this to a stu-
dent arriving for his lunch from a
humanities lecture or meeting? I
feel I need not answer that. One
or two of the staff are complete-
ly obnoxious to all customers, an
image that people will be left
with when they think about Da
Vinci's. Furthermore, a senior
member of staff blatantly lied to
me about signs up in Da Vinci's
falsely stating the availability of
food at different times of the
day. H e promised me personally
that he would change them -
three months on there has been
no action, what are people sup-
posed to think when senior mem-
bers of staff lie while giving off an
image of sincere regret?
These grumbles apart, the
union does provide a reasonable
service. Events such as Welfare
Week do have limited effect
within the college community
(not necessarily a fault of the
union or its officers), but res-
earch needs to be done to find
ways of increasing the knowledge
of and participation in such
events. Perhaps it may be easier
for the union to interact with the
general student community with
the greater presence of staff on
the reception desk, providing a
much needed break from the
previous miserable, grudging ser-
vice that greeted visitors. To con-
clude: the union is doing well,
but could do much better on the
fronts mentioned above. A n d
without forward planning (which
appears to be lacking at present),
the union will be unable to cater
for future needs.
Yours sincerely,
Chris Bragg Physics 3
Union Staff:
Sadly we have to agree with Chris
Bragg's comments on the level and
quality of services and environment
at ICU when compared with those
of other major institutions.
Unfortunately IC was late in recog-
nising the necessity of such develop-
ments. Many of the other colleges
had started investing time and
money into student services back in
the early eighties. Long term plan-
ning in student unions is crucial to
students to give three major benefits:
1. The satisfaction and welfare of
students who use and run the ser-
vices.
2. The ability through such services
to attract future students when coin-
petition between colleges is tough.
3. The generation of income through
well-used services to enable the
Union to have autonomy in future
growth and development of all
aspects of commercial and non-com-
mercial services (from clubs and
societies to welfare, student develop-
ment, etc.)
Over the past few years we have
started to redress the balance. Da
Vinci's was totally refurbished, toi-
lets were replaced, the Union
Offices were moved to a more cen-
tral, approachable position, the
Bookstore was completely refitted
and the Newsagents was developed.
There are plans for a major
development of the entertainment
venue and bar/food areas. We have
had to put some of these on hold
while we are uncertain of our perma-
nent location. We do, however,
recognise that the Union cannot
stand still until decisions are taken
about its future. We are currently
looking into a relatively small scale
development which would at least
improve the environment in the short
term.
Comments like those from
Chris are very welcome. They show
us that in fighting for improved stu-
dent services and facilities we are
truly representing student opinion.
IC students, both present and
future, deserve facilities at least as
good as those of any other university
in the country, and we will get there.
We were disappointed with the
lack of response to the Felix appeal.
We need your input to make this the
Union that you want il to be.
Ents manager:
Queuing is as a result of the
increased demand for the services
offered on a Friday night. The actual
capacity for the union on a normal
Friday night is 750, which compares
favourably in relation to other
London colleges. This increases to
1200 on carnivals. As events become
more popular, we have tried to
inform people of the need to arrive
early. If people are unable to get in,
this because we have to observe legal
fire limits.
Our non-operation of a one-in
one-out policy is a result of discus-
sion with local residents, fire author-
ities and police. We have to carefully
observe it, as any problems caused
outside Beit could result in the loss
of our licence.
Bar Manager:
The suppliers of pool tables, as well
as insurers, require that they are
positioned in full view of a member
of staff all the time: with our restrict-
ed space, this could be very difficult.
Everybody would agree we should
have more space, both in front of
and behind the bar.
The keeping of cask ales can be
a tricky business. One of the most
important requirements is cleanli-
ness. To ensure all ales are served in
top quality condition, the lines must
be cleaned regularly. Sometimes this
may lead to a specific brand not
being available for a short time.
We endeavour to offer a varied
selection of traditional ales: although
we have nine handpumps, we have
offered in excess of thirty different
ales in recent months. This inevitably
means that certain ales are not avail-
able at all times. We always endeav-
our to serve only quality products,
but if a customer is not satisfied they
will always be offered an alternative.
Cigars will be available behind the
bar in the very near future.
Catering manager:
I put signs up 48 hours after speak-
ing to you, and they were continual-
ly ripped down and replaced. I got
fed up with this behaviour, but I
should have thought of an alterna-
tive. Sorry. Food running out is
unfortunate, but we inevitably have
it happening a certain amount in
attempts to avoid wastage.
