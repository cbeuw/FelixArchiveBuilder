Alter a quick survey done by some enthusiastic physics students
it has transpired that most of the IC population (student and non-stu-
dent) has no knowledge of the existence of the "Student Textbook
Exchange - Secondhand Bookshop" that operates on campus and has
been running For the last seven years.
The secondhand bookshop buys From graduating students text-
books oF every major discipline (engineering, physics, chemistry,
maths, geology, etc), has a large selection ol literature, Fiction, popu-
lar science, as well as Foreign titles, dictionaries, chess books, minia-
ture music scores and much more. The stock changes daily so what
you might not Find today might be there tomorrow. A l l at prices usu-
ally less than halF oF the original price of the book. There are also a lot
oF out-oF-print books available.
The bookshop is operated on a non-profit making basis by Bob
Speerand is situated on Level 3 oF the Physics Department (next to
the Blackett lilts).
You can also sell any old books and textbooks in almost any con-
dition but the better they look the more you are going to get For them.
There is usually groovy soFt music playing inside, a comFortable read-
ing area is situated right outside it (Food and drink allowed - For a
change), chess and backgammon sets are available Free oF charge and
a selection oF popular magazines (Time-Out, Felix, etc.) is also avail-
able.
So whether you're looking lor that expensive textbook halF-price,
want to get rid oF some old stuff while making some cash, or are just
interested in what you might Find, come along to the secondhand
bookshop. We're open 12 - 2pm, 12 - 5pm on Wednesdays.
