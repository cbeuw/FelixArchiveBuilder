-album: babylon zoo - the
boy with the x-ray eyesalok
Okay, so we have a formula here - quiet starts and
manic choruses. Jas Mann played
all the instruments on this album
which, I must say, is pretty good.
It is awash with political infer-
ences (I think the word 'fascist'
appears in every track) which
perhaps have some meaning to
Jas the Mann himself but which I
didn't find particularly illuminat-
ing. We're talking a lot of melan-
choly and "this world is bad" feel-
ing.
'Spaceman'stands out as the ,
best song by a long way.
However, other tracks such as the 'Is Your Soul
For Sale' (almost Pink Floyd-ish with its piano and
vocal intro gently overlaid with weird sound
effects), and Animal Army' (using a very Lou *
Reed-ish bass line) also stand out.
If you listened to a couple of particular tracks
you might think that this Babylon Zoo character
was doing hard rock. However, if you listened to
a couple of different ones you
might think that he was into psy-
chedelic ballads. In other words,
it's hard to classily this type of
music but I get the leeling that
Jas Mann was going for a catego-
ry created by Pink Floyd's 'The
II Wall'. The similarities are uncan-
• ny - the segued tracks, the songs
about personal hates and politi-
cal regimes and, most of all, the
sneering vocals.
At the end ol the day, this album
comes nowhere near 'The Wall'
as far as quality is concerned but the potential for
an album of that stature is definitely there. (6)
album: saw doctors -
same oul' townnr. trout
It is difficult to write about the Saw Doctors with-
out using words like "charm", "folksy", "tradition-
al" and "rootsy" because these are words that
describe them so well. However, to categorise
them as just another Irish folk band would do
them no justice.
'Same Oul' Town' is an album of rare class in
which biting social comment and heartfelt longing
("I want you more than a pint after closing time"
- 'I Want You More') are masked by deceptively
sweet sing-along melodes.
There are some weaker tracks. The title
track, for example, falls into the age-old trap of a
slow song ending up like a dirge. However, even
then/Les Moran and Davy Carton's lyrics can
always raise an interesting thought, or at least a
smile.
The overall feeling that I get of the Saw
Doctors is that of a high IQ Shane MacGowan on
Prozac. In other words, this album is just not to be
missed. (9)
