In a vague attempt to move from
this job in July into a position in
which I will get paid rather more
for considerably less hours, I
found myself in one of those
graduate recruitment interviews
this morning. I'm still in a state
of great nervous tension: I sus-
pect the memory will haunt me
for years. My interviewer asked
what was 'the most creative
thing I had ever done'. I'm not
going to tell you what I said in
response, because it's simply far
too embarrassing. What worries
me almost as much as the reali-
sation that I have, developed the
ability to spout management
consultant-esque cheesy drivel is
the fact that he honestly seemed
to feel that it was a good reply.
Still, all is not lost, and into
the void left when I rushed off to
be an executive, Civil Engin-
eering's Mr Cedd Burge has ably
stepped to take over the rest of
the editorial...
/ have a little story about
Gerald Johnson, a pillar of
strength in the highly dedicated
X-Coitntry community. Gerald
is unfortunately a diabetic, and
has to put himself through the rit-
ual steroid / cocaine jokes every
time he gets his needle out. When
exercising, low blood sugar can be
a particularly big problem, and
the possibility of being a long way
from a chocolate machine if one
feels the need. Now the obvious
drawback to this plan is the lack
of pockets in your average pair of
lycra shorts. But Gerald has cov-
ered all bases by sticking a mars
bar down his pants. Usually when
Gerald trains the mars bar is
wholly uneaten by the time he's
finished, although often fairly wet
and squishy.
Gerald is one of the more
dedicated runners (Honest), and
generally exercises 4 or 5 times a
week. As Gerald agrees eating the
mars bar after the run would be
quite a grim task, so he does not,
prefering instead to buy a new
one. However Gerald has hit
hard times recently, his bank bal-
ance reaching the "5 pounds over
the limit, no you can't have any
more you skint bastard" stage.
This caused Gerald to introduce
some cost cutting measures, and
the first obvious thought was to
cut down on the excess mars bars.
'The mars bar recycling plan'
involves having the same mars
bar down his pants every time he
goes out. It was all going very well
until one fateful day, after 3.5
months of hard slog with the same
sweaty mars bar, the man felt an
oncoming desire to lose concious-
ness, and had to make the deci-
sion that was later described by
me to be "about as stupid as the
bloke who decided to bomb
Canary Wharf". Felix quoted
Gerald as saying "urrrr, where
am I?"

LETTERS TO FELIX:
Dear Felix,
Having noticed that your letters
page has been rather sparse
recently, we decided to write
you a nice whinging letter.
Whilst enjoying a 'good" night
out at the Union on Friday 9th,
we couldn't help noticing the
appalling behaviour of many IC
students. During the course of
the evening our enjoyement was
interrupted several times by the
worrying sight of fights being
broken up by Union
stewards,who also had the dis-
agreable task of throwing out
numerous juvenile drunkards. By
far the most annoying behaviour
was that of three - to our mind -
typical IC students, who seemed
to find the constant and
extremely loud impersonation of
farm animals (especially donkeys
and sheep) very amusing. Their
attitude towards young ladies
was equally childish. One young
lady, who had the misfortune of
passing by their table several
times, was repeatedly greeted
with cries of "Geeezuss!!", and
seemed considerably distressed.
We see nothing funny in this, we
must assume that it was a private
joke amongst them. Surely this
conduct is unbecoming of so-
called adults. Is it suprising that
so many people are embarrassed
to say that-they study at IC?
Yours sincerely,
Rupert Ingham, Lawrence Gould,
Markos Daskalakis (CivEng 2)
