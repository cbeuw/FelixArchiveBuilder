film: sense and sensibility
wexxistock
Sense and Sensibility has already won Emma
Thompson a Golden Globe for Best Adapted
screenplay as well as having several other nomi-
nations. It reaches our shores with high Oscar
prospects and a completely British luwie cast.
However, contrary to most British period cos-
tume dramas, this isn't from the Merchant Ivory
him company but is directed by Taiwanese Ang
Lee (Eat Drink Man Woman) who seems to give
the film a bit more life and realism than a
Merchant Ivory production.
We enter the
story as mother and
three daughters,
Elinor (Thompson),
Marianne (Kate Wins- Jj|
let) and Margaret have
lost their father and •
are left with little
money due to the
laws governing inheri-
tance. Before the
Dashwood women
leave their home
Elinor falls in love with
the endearing Edward
Ferrars (Hugh Grant),
brother of their step-
brother's wife, the
domineering Fanny Ferrars. This obvious mutual
attraction goes unsaid and is prevented from
blossoming as Edward is forced off to London by
his family. Fanny couldn't let Edward marry
someone without money or social stature. Mrs
Dashwood's cousin, Sir John Middleton takes
the four women under his wing aided by Mrs
Jennings who tries her best to marry off the two
daughters. This unwanted interference is not
very productive yet Marianne's affairs of the
heartflourishas she falls hook, line and sinker for
the dashing Willoughby (Greg Wise). When he
comes to her rescue when she sprains her ankle!
All this is much to the dismay of the more
restrained but no less infatuated Colonel
Brandon (Alan Rickman) who has a tragic lost
love past. He isn't willing to wear his heart on his
sleeve so will Edward visits the Dashwoods as he
promised and confesses his affections for Elinor?
Who will Marianne chose, the reliable and caring
Colonel Brandon
The beautiful scenery
the charming rogue
Willoughby?
The story unfolds with
little moments of com-
edy often supplied by
the bluntness of Mr
Palmer (Hugh Laurie)
and you soon become
thoroughly engrossed
in the intricate rela-
tionships ofthe charac-
ters. The quality of the
cast makes the story
believable, it's roman-
tic and sad but not over
the top as can often
happen with British
films aimed at the
American audience,
adds to the sense of
escapism of the film and even though this is a
period drama it's very easy to identify with the
characters. Even the most cynical audience can't
fail to leave the cinema with a warm glow alter-
natively this could be because the heating was up
too high!
film: jumanjLsrecs martin senven
'In the jungle you must wait, until the dice read
six or eight'. These were the words with which
Alan Parish disappeared into the mysterious
board game, Jumanji, after starting the game in
1969 with his soul mate Sarah. 26 years later,
two unsuspecting children, Judy (Kirsten
Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce), find the
game in the derelicked Parish household. After
starting the game with the remaining two pieces,
they inadvertently release Alan (Robin Williams)
back into the real world, sporting a very long
beard and classic jungle attire. It turns out that
perils from the jungle haunt the players until
someone reaches the end, and to make matters
worse, the players that start have to go on. After
tackling the rather large lion and killer mosqui-
toes that they have released into the world, the
3 strong team go off to find Sarah (Bonnie
Hunt), who is still undergoing psychiatric treat-
ment after seeing Alan disappear.
The plot continues with the four of them
playing the game, apprehensively reading the
messages in the centre of the board and awaiting
their fate. Together they manage to survive a
monsoon, vicious monkeys, herds of rhinos and
a rather amusing hunter called the Exterminator.
Although the plot sounds rather weird (to say
the least!) it is nonetheless very enjoyable for a
wide audience, including all you logically mind-
ed, scientific Imperial students. At the very least,
you'll marvel at what represents some of today's
best examples of computer rendered graphics. If
you want a totally fantastic and wacky film, with
loads of laughs, then go and see Jumanji.
