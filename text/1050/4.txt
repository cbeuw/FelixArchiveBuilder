H E funding backtrack by Shephard
MIKE INGRAM
There are signs this week that the
Government is being forced to
reconsider its position on univer-
sity funding. In the face of almost
universal opposition to cuts in the
higher education budget, splits
between education ministers
have come to light.
The Education Secretary,
Gillian Shephard, has told the
Committee of Vice Chancellors
and Principals (CVCP) that she
will present them with broad
proposals on the size, structure
and funding of higher education.
The proposals are expected to be
vague, allowing details to be filled
in after fuller consideration. The
committee has also been present-
ed with a timetable for the dis-
cussion of these issues, in time
for its meeting today.
The move is an attempt to
head off action threatened by the
C V C P if the current funding cri-
sis is not resolved. These mea-
sures, including the imposition of
a Â£300 top-up fee on students,
are timed to coincide with the
general election, and could dam-
age the Government's campaign
[Felix 1049).
Many within the C V C P feel
that the government's promise of
public discussion on higher edu-
cation is merely a delaying tactic.
Clive Booth, vice chancellor of
Oxford Brookes University and
outgoing vice-chairman of the
committee, said: "For too long
Government has been saying 'we
need a debate'. However, the
time has come for some deci-
sion."
In future discussions, vice
chancellors will be attempting to
"tie |the Government] down as
much as possible on policy and
issues." The committee has
already produced its own propos-
als on the future of higher educa-
tion funding, which will be pre-
sented to ministers by the end of
the month.
Differences of opinion on
the future of higher education
have even emerged within gov-
ernment ranks. Last week saw
the launch of a report on univer-
sity funding from the
Conservative Political Centre
(Felix 1049). Speaking at the
launch, the Higher Education
minister Eric Forth criticised
parts of the government's educa-
tion policy. He questioned the
government's intention to contin-
ue increasing availability of higher
education: "It needs to be asked
whether the current rate oi 30
per cent is about the right pro-
portion."
Mr Forth also rejected the
report's proposal that student
maintenance be paid for by an
income-contingent loan: "One of
the things that irritates me at the
moment is that people think that
if you talk about income contin-
gent loans frequently enough, the
problem will go away. That sim-
ply won't do."
The income contingent loans
scheme is also supported by the
C V C P and other groups. Sir Eric
Ash, former Rector of Imperial
College and non-executive direc-
tor of the Student Loans compa-
ny described the idea as "entirely
sensible", and inevitable "in one
form or another". The report also
proposes a national academic
credit transfer scheme, an idea
which is supported by the C V C P .
Discussions between
Government and universities
may not be the only way of mak-
ing progress on the funding issue.
The Association of University
Teachers repeated its call for a
Royal Commission to be set up to
examine the "nightmare issue" of
funding. The proposed
Commission would examine
opinions from all sides of the
debate, and report next summer
with a solution.
Foot on Wells
P H O T O : A L E X FEAKES
Former Labour Party leader, Rt Hon Michael Foot reached deep for
his speech on Wednesday evening. He spoke in the Haldane library,
and attended a reception afterwards.
BY DAVID COHEN
H G Wells is often referred to as
the father of Science Fiction. He
is seldom recognised as the social
thinker that he was. O n
Wednesday evening, as indeed in
his recent biography, Michael
Foot attempted to highlight this
aspect of Wells' work. A better
biographer could not have been
chosen by Wells' himself for such
a task (Foot was leader of the
Labour party between 1980-
1983, and is a staunch socialist
himself).
From his allegorical treat-
ment of Imperialism in "War of
the Worlds", criticising its inhu-
manity, to his prognostication
regarding the effects of atomic
power in "World Set Free", Wells
trained his mind not only on the
contemporary problems of
humanity, but also those of the
future. To illustrate, Foot read a
passage from "World Set Free" in
which Wells imagined the Strand
populated with unemployed peo-
ple "shamelessly begging."
Later Wells wrote about his
vision o f U t o p i a , collecting his
idylls of humanity in this tome. It
is perhaps saddening to then
learn that towards the end of his
life he became despondent a n d
bitter. Perhaps it is not surpris-
ing, considering these last
thoughts were written during,
and after the Second World War,
soon after which he died.
Michael Foot clearly admires
Wells as a novelist but above all
as a visionary thinker. As such it
would be inappropriate to com-
pare these two characters on
these grounds, Foot seems to be
the perfect pupil and humble dis-
ciple of Wellsian thought.
Despite a frail frame and a
malignant tunour on his left eye,
Foot delivered an eloquent
speech and, unlike Wells in his
old age, is still resolute in his
beliefs.
In particular, he is no less
anxious about the nuclear threat,
despite the recent non-prolifera-
tion treaty (which, he says, Wells
predicted as being the only way
to control this form o f technolog-
ical advancement).
It is easy to be cynical about
Foot's motives to publish this
work exactly 50 years after
Wells' death, but in fact a
European Union directive has
been issued to extend the copy-
right period. It seems Foot is a
genuine socialist warrior to the
last.
