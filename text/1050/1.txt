College authorities have indicat-
ed that they may ask for up to
£80,000 a year from the bidder
successful in their application to
run the new bookstore. IC's
Estates Department are planning
to launch an 'invitation to ten-

major book companies, such as
Blackwells and Dillons, in man-

They will also consider an
application from I C U , who cur-

Sherfield Walkway, but Union
officials are concerned that they
will be priced out of the market.

The Director of Estates, Ian
Caldwell, insisted that the bids
"will be judged on.a balanced set
of criteria between service, the
financial deal, and the risk."
The Estates Department are
planning to include the large
bookstore on the ground floor of
the library (Felix 1044) when it
is expanded as part of the cur-
rent expansion plans.
