Deranged films at SCAB evening
Sir, — We have read with a v i d
interest (?) the stirring p i e c e ,
printed i n last w e e k ' s F e l i x
i s s u e , written by . ' S P U P ' of
P h y s i c s
F i r s t l y , the reputation of
S C A B E v e n i n g s as a forum for
' A r t i s t i c ' expression i s w e l l
inowtj, even amongst phys-
i c i s t s . Although the offending
performances affected Mr Spup
nobody w a s forcing him to
stay and continue watching the
f i l m s . Secondly, intelligent
people should be able to
decide whether they wish to
rook at something or not.
T h i r d l y , blue films were not
the only form of art to be
performed during the evening.
We would like to point out
that although we d o not
appreciate the finer art i n
performances of this nature,
we see no reason to persecute
others who attend, either for
sexual satisfaction or just a
good laugh. T h i s c a n be
illustrated by the fact that a
s i z e a b l e proportion of the
audience at the R C S Smoking
Concert persisted in making
remarks to the stripper about
the whereabouts of her alsatian
and e e l s . If this fine f e l l o w
took the trouble to find o u t
the views of other people, he
would s e e that the majority
of people enjoyed both
evenings' entertainment.
We look forward, with great
anticipation, to the meeting
between Mr Spup and Ms
M i l l i n g t o n , that w e l l known
entrepreneuse of erotica.

Sir, — F o l l o w i n g the letter from
S P U P , P h y s i c s 2 , printed i n
last w e e k ' s i s s u e , I would like
to make some comments myself
about^ the S C A B evening
events which lite (I assume,
perhaps mistakenly, that S P U P
is a male) found s o upsetting,
the way I s e e die situation,
and l a s t l y about a n E d i t o r i a l
P o l i c y I should like to s e e
invoked in a l l future issues of
F E L I X .
F i r s t l y , though, I must s a y
that the rantings of this
unfortunate (on h i s own
admission) individual are
reminiscent of those of the
estimable L o r d Longford a n d
Mary Whitehouse, who, at
great risk, subject themselves
to deplorable and unspeakable
depths of filth and depravity
in order to protect the 'public
at large'. What right have these
self-appointed savers of our
souls to say w h i c h book,
t e l e v i s i o n programme, film or
show we should or should not
see? What right has S P U P to
say that it i s necessary to
" r i d C o l l e g e of any future
threat of obscene s h o w i n g s " ?
But what of these films, the
" o b s c e n e s h o w i n g s " ? Y e s ,
they were degenerate — by
definition, a blue movie c a n
be nothing e l s e ! — and I, like
S P U P , viewed the scenes of
bestiality with contempt. B u t ,
in my c a s e , a s was evidently
l a c k i n g in S P U P ' s , there was
mingled with this initial
revulsion a touch of humour;
if provided only by the
pathetic attempts of the
'actors' to prompt the hound,
which seemed perpetually to
forget its l i n e s , and the alto-
gether crummy editing.
S P U P knew what he w a s
going to see — blue movies.
If (and we c a n only assume
that he d i d know h i s own
opinions on such forms of
'entertainment' before going
into the showing) he felt that
he w a s going to be so upset
by the whole affair he should
have stayed away. That way
he would have saved himself
much embarrassment a n d
anger and p o s s i b l e mental
derangement.
But w h o i s this S P U P
character anyway? Nobody
knows. There are lots ol
people to choose from i n
P h y s i c s 2, and of course, that
might be put in to throw y o u
off the track. B u t the final
point 1 w i s h to make i s t h i s :
it i s a fine and noble thing to
write to F E L I X saying how
good t h i s , how bad that, how
obscene the other. But it i s
quite another kettle of f i s h to
actually sign your name to
your views and be recognisable
as the possessor of a belief,
opinion, or m i s h e g o s s . It i s
only right, after a l t , that a
person without the guts to
put h i s name behind h i s
argument should not have h i s
argument heard.
Y o u r s

What transport
thorn ?
Dear S i r , — In response to
Derrick E v e r e t t ' s 'Orange
Mole' column last week we
must point out that transport
is not 'a thorn in the Union's
side',rather it i s a great a s s e t .
A C C and R C C transport is
self financing and i s run
efficiently by A C C a n d the
R C C transport sub committee.
There certainly are a lot
of problems in this area but at
present R C C a n d A C C have
them well under control.
Yours Sincerely,
Andy N e l s o n

The problems
of parking
Dear Sir, — The other morning,
with my H-Zone parking permit
proudly stuck on my windscreen,
I attempted to park in the
allotted zone i n Imperial
Institute R o a d .
But lo! It seemed that
H—Zone w a s already f u l l of
other blighters, who far from
parking neatly side by side,
had parked i n any-old- how
with exaggerated s p a c i n g .
E v e n t u a l l y , after much ' t o ' i n g
and 'fro'ing, I managed to
squeeze i n between two
v e h i c l e s .
At this point, a problem
became apparent, since I w a s
now unable to open the c a r
door. I swiftly wound down the
window and individually trans-
ferred my briefcase, flask a n d
sandwiches through the window
to the front bonnet. I then
dexterously climbed out
through the window and stood
between the two c a r s , opened
my door — a s far as I could —
and stretched inwards to wind
up the window.
At this point — when the
window w a s nearly c l o s e d —
another p r o b l e m became
apparent. I w a s unable to
reach in far enough to c l o s e
the window fully.
With some considerable
difficulty, I managed to get
the window fully open again.
I then climbed back in to the
c a r , wound up the window and
locked die door from the i n s i d e .
I then opened the front
window on the opposite s i d e ,
climbed out and opened the
door. T o my relief
the clearance between my c a r
and the adjacent vehicle was
about a n inch greater on this
s i d e , and I eventually succeed-
ed i n winding the window fully
c l o s e d .
A s I proudly shut the door
and locked it, my triumph was
crowned — by a standing
ovation from a window on the
6th floor of the Biochemistry
Department.
