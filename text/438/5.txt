Linstead HallrThe rush to
The present Linstead Hall was opened in 1968 and built from
funds donated by the same beneficiary as the present £350,000
given for it s extension. The new benefaction came in January
this year and was conditional on C o l l e g e being in a position to
start building by January 1977. T h e C o l l e g e duly set up a
working party that considered the plans submitted by architects
Norman and Dawbarn.
The plans were a l s o scrutinised by Westminster C i t y C o u n c i l ' s
(WCC) Department of Architecture and Planning when they
received the ammended C o l l e g e p l a n s . S i n c e July the C o l l e g e
and the Department have been in consultation, ironing o u t
design problems and s e r v i c i n g arrangements.
These negotiations were so s u c c e s s f u l that the Department
gave the C o l l e g e plans a clean b i l l of health in a report to the
W C C Town Planning Committee meeting of 28th October. In
particular the Department rejected the ideology of a low r i s e
development for P r i n c e s Gardens. They thought that a third type
of architecture — in addition to the terraced houses and student
h a l l s — would not be appropriate to complete the square. They
felt the college plans retained the Gardens' e s s e n t i a l character-
i s t i c s .
The Department a l s o decided that a population density of 200
persons per acre was 'not unappropriate for student accommoda-
tion'. Thus they rejected the Knightsbridge A s s o c i a t i o n ' s ( K A )
submission that a density of 85—100 be adopted for the new The space that refuses to be filled at present.
spend £350,00000
building. Attached to their report was a draft letter to IC giving
planning permission.
The Department's recommendations were overturned at the
Town Planning Committee meeting and the design rejected on
grounds of height and general d e s i g n . The meeting w a s w e l l
attended by the K A , who had lobbied the C o u n c i l l o r s beforehand.
The mood of the meeting was such that a member of C o l l e g e
remarked that it was a c a s e of " H o w do we reject these p l a n s " ,
not 'Whether we reject t h e m " .
Since then the benefactor has extended the deadline to
January 1978. The extension w i l l be fully d i s c u s s e d at a
Governing Body meeting today week.
The College proposal
The proposed extension to L i n s t e a d H a l l has been planned
by the C o l l e g e Architects to a layout and design which embodies
the advice and requirements of student representatives who were
members of a Working Party first established in 1972 to consider
the further development of student residential accommodation in
P r i n c e ' s Gardens. Although earlier schemes for loan-financed
development had to be abandoned through lack of finance,the
offer by the Anonymous Benefactor made possible the realisation
of plans which have been the subject of careful consideration
for some y e a r s .
The extension is planned to provide 9 5 residential p l a c e s on
the site immediately north of L i n s t e a d H a l l and above t h e
existing calorifier chamber which was s p e c i a l l y designed as a
base for a new building. So as not to intrude a third architectural
design into the Gardens (in view of the preservation order on
8—15 P r i n c e ' s Gardens on the north side) the architectural
design reflects broadly the rhythm and style of L i n s t e a d H a l l ,
it follows the same structural grid and has identical floor heights
for ease of communication. In order to take account of v i e w s
expressed by local residents the overall height of the building is
three storeys lower than L i n s t e a d H a l l itself; for aesthetic
considerations and for economy of maintenance improved materials
are to be used on the exterior of the building, and the design of
study bedroom? has been improved to reduce sound e m i s s i o n — a
point of concern to the local residents.
Internally a typical floor is designed on a "communal
corridor" principle around which study bedrooms are double-
banked, the corridor being divided by fire doors to permit 4 or 5
students to share a utility room (galley) bathroom and separate
WC and shower compartment — a s i m p l e flat concept — but a l s o
allowing, if necessary, for a wider s o c i a l grouping of up to 16—
20 on one floor. Vertical circulation is by s t a i r c a s e and lifts.
The building includes two self-contained flatlets for the
accommodation of married students. The concentration of the
rooms in a single block does not contravene the permitted
densities laid down by the planning authorities, and contributes
to developing the Gardens to their full potential. T h e C o l l e g e
A r c h i t e c t s have been in c l o s e touch throughout the planning
stages with the officers of the P l a n n i n g authority, whose publicly
expressed advice was that the A r c h i t e c t s should not do other than
conform to the lines of the square, in order to retain the e s s e n t i a l
characteristic enclosure which is t y p i c a l of London s q u a r e s .
Having looked deeply at the various plans put forward for the
Linstead extension the two of us feel inclined to agree in
principle, with the height of the C o l l e g e d e s i g n . L i k e W. C i t y
C o u n c i l ' s own Architectural and P l a n n i n g Dept we are against a
low rise extension. The square should be completed with a
medium rise development — like Southside and Linstead — a s
originally envisaged before the ' l i s t i n g ' of 8—15 P r i n c e s
Gardens.
We feel that, any low rise development would destroy the
square by adding a further architectural d e s i g n . We hope that the
Royal F i n e Art Commission ( R F A C ) , who have been a s k e d to
comment on how — low rise or medium rise — the square should
be completed, w i l l come to a s i m i l a r c o n c l u s i o n . If they do this
may provide sufficient grounds for a C o l l e g e appeal to t h e
Department of Environment.
However, we are less keen on the way C o l l e g e h a s approached
the extension's d e s i g n . There seems to have been insufficient
d i s c u s s i o n within C o l l e g e . We were hardly endeared to learn
that L i n s t e a d warden Dr Carabine did not receive a copy of the
C o l l e g e plans — as submitted to Westminster C C — and had to
get one through devious means.
Further, Topic, the C o l l e g e magazine, has not been a l l o w e d
to publish as much as it would have liked on the C o l l e g e plans.
We realise that in the future interests of the C o l l e g e some matters
should not be made public immediately — however does this rule
out a completely 'quiet d i s c u s s i o n ' ?
We feel that whatever the comment of the R F A C o m m i s s i o n
further d i s c u s s i o n is needed — e s p e c i a l l y concerning the facade
and interior d e t a i l s . T h i s is an area where it would be useful
to involve the warden, Dr C a r a b i n e , even though he has not been
designated warden of the new e x t e n s i o n .
We would ask the question that if one of the terms of the
benefaction has been changed (the time limit) is it a b s o l u t e l y
impossible to change others if either C o l l e g e is c o n s i s e n t l y
denied planning permission or changes are warranted to provide
a better h a l l ?
Further more we are not completely s a t i s f i e d that the terms
of the benefaction were not influenced by top c o l l e g e personnel.
T h i s supplement is intended to stimulate d i s c u s s i o n on the
Linstead extension. Letters on the subject are welcome s i n c e
they w i l l help to provide a wealth of ideas to construct the new
brief to the C o l l e g e architects.
