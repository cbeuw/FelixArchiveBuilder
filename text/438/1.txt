Clarke to
go?
I C U appears l i k e l y to
support moves to oust
Charles Clarke as N U S
President at this weekend's
NUS Conference.
The moves to get rid of

started from both the ultra left
and the Federation of C o n -
servative Students ( F C S ) o n the
right.

RSMU reject
women diners?
Problems could l i e ahead
for R S M U following a debate
on whether women should be
allowed to go to Mines
fresher's dinner. T h e question
put to the meeting, that
women be a l l o w e d to attend
their departmental fresher's
dinner, w a s defeated. T h i s
result does not become R S M U
policy nor does it affect the
R S M U constitution.
However it ranspired i n the
debate that the R S M U con-
stitution . already allows
women to go.-.'to t i e dinners.
The relevant part reads 'The
priveleges of the Union
accorded to members shall
include the right to attend and
introduce guests to such
functions as may be arranged
by the Union'.
P r e s s e d as to whether
these included dinners,
R S M U P r e s i d e n t P a u l K u r o w s k i
commented ' / / you're goingto
interpret that part of the
constituation as such there is
nothing to stop anyone in the
Union going to any of the
fresher's dinners'.
Mr K u r o w s k i feels that i s
now up to R S M U General
Committee to interpret the
constitution a n d decide
whether the current practise —
where only men attend the
departmental fresher's dinners
— should continue. A t present
R S M U does arrange a L a d i e s
freshers' dinner which has
equal numbers o ^ meji a n d
