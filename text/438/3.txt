A s a student journalist I have
taken surrealist's view of NUS
Conferences in the last two years.
Rarely has conference come up
with substantial pieces of new policy
of relevance to students.
It is easy to criticise NUS as

Education and Welfare dept and has
negotiating links where they are
needed.
If, as expected, Conference
decides to sell Endsleigh to save the
Union then NUS will be no less strong
as a negotiator. Rather than opt out

grant doesn't cover this retainer and
you were allowed to claim benefit for
this.
Mr David Ennals (Social Services
Secretary) says the Government
considers the bill contains 'sensible
measures for students'. So much for
the Welfare State (sic) and the Labour
Party. Let's hope the latter wake up
before the bill's final reading.
Otherwise this measure will put
another nail in the coffin of the prin-
ciple of 'Higher Education being
available to all regardless of wealth'.

I was rather bemused to learn that
few in RSM Union knew that women in
RSM had a right to go to their fresher's

I hadn't heard Stuart Ardern, Mines
Pornographer, say that the jokes at
the Chaps Club — the all-male Mines
social club — dinner were suitable for
mixed company. Besides which dinner
goers have no obligation to drink a
yard of ale.
Special thanks to Paul Ekpenyong,
without whose help Felix would not
have come out this week. Apologies
to Chalky whose article suffered a
pasting up fault.

There is always a need for staff on
Student papers; no paper — except the
complacent ones — can say it's ever
overloaded with staff. F E L I X welcomes
anyone who wants to contribute to
their (the student's) paper. Especially
needed are people who know how to
use a drawing board and would like
put the paper together — literally. We
call these Paste Up Artists, they're
held in high regard as they stick the
pieces of typeset copy on to pieces
paper that are printed to become your
paper. Patience and clean bands are
the desired virtues here.
Also in demand are book reviewers
who get free copies of the works they
review.

Govt logic
Last week the Social Services
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill re-
ceived its second reading in the
Commons. This will stop students
claimingsocial security/supplementary
benefit during the short vacations. It
also stops students claiming benefit
for rents of their digs, flats etc over
these vacations. Now that's alright if
you live in an IC hall and don't pay
rent over Xmas provided you go home.
At least 2/3rds of IC students live

Hampson welcomes Consoc growth
At a meeting of I C C o n -
servative Society, last T u e s d a y ,
Dr K e i t h Hampson MP welcomed
the growth of University
Conservative A s s o c i a t i o n s and
their growing influence in the
Students Unions.
On h i s main theme 'Higher
education', he expressed a
necessity for a balance
between the general liberal
courses and the job-orientated
ones. T h e main problem, he
s a i d , i s there are too many
'arts and humanities' students
and too few 'Science a n d
Engineering O n e s ' ,
T h i s i s particularly s o in
the P o l y t e c h n i c s where the
courses are being offered to
make use of the f a c i l i t i e s
left by the d e c l i n i n g teacher
training courses, Dr Hampson
a l s o suggested that Engineer-
ing courses should have a
greater 'industry-approach',
for example sandwich courses.
Commenting on the education
c u t s , Dr Hampson a c c u s e d the
Left of being more prepared t o
cut higher education on the
grounds that it w a s only
available to a n elite which
included just a small porpor-
tion of the working c l a s s . H e
himself would like to see a
new approach to higher
education with a much greater
emphasis on the p r o v i s i o n of
a adequate student grant.
Dr Hampson c l o s e d by
expressing h i s disapproval
at the two-tier fees rates for
home and overseas students.
He felt is was a bit of a sham
when most home students had
their fees paid by their local
education authority.
He suggested that w h e n
an overseas student i s not
supported b y h i s or h e r
government that B r i t a i n might
supply funds from her e x i s t -
ing Overseas A i d fund.
