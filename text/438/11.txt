THE NEEDY HELPERS
DESPERATELY NEED YOU
A grunt comes from a heap
of cardboard boxes and plastic
bags o n a park bench, and a
grimy hand reaches out from
under the heap for the warm
drink offered. Soon a whiskery
fate, bleary-eyed and pinched
with the idd appears.
T h i s i s a scene which
occurs every night on w h i c h
soup-run takes p l a c e ; when
members o f I C Community
A c t i o n Group ( I C C A G ) travel
down to the C h a r i n g - C r o s s
area a t about midnight to
walk around the Embankment
Gardens and Strand P a l a c e , to
give the " d o s s e r s " — w h o
sleep-out there — something
warm to drink, and to have
a chat to them.
T h e soup-run is just one
of the I C C A G ' s a c t i v i t i e s , the
group's a i m being to give
direct help to people i n need,
whether it be children or o l d
people.
At present we have a dire
lack of people. We e s p e c i a l l y
need help on:
Soup-Run
I C C A G members are p i c k e d
up from Falmouth K i t c h e n on
Monday nights at 11 o ' c l o c k ,
and o n Friday nights from
T i z a r d kitchen at 11.30pm. If
you want to come a l o n g , just
turn up; y o u ' l l be taken back
home by mini-bus afterwards.
Play-Group
A group of k i d s from
deprived areas in L o n d o n i s
A c c o m p a n i e d by I C C A G
members t o , for example, one
of the L o n d o n parks, to have a
good time and to get them out
of their sometimes depressing
enviroments. I C C A G members
are p i c k e d up from the U n i o n
arch-way at 2 o ' c l o c k o n
Sundays, s o if y o u like
children, come along at this
time.
Cottage „.-.ekends are a l s o
organised for c h i l d r e n . Here
I C C A G members go with them
to a country cottage to have a
weekend away from L o n d o n .
It c a n prove to be the first
time that some of the children
see such mundane things a s
c o w s .
V i s i t i n g O l d P e o p l e : -
T h i s can be quite s u c c e s s -
ful if y o u get on w e l l with
people, a n d the o l d person
tends to become like a second
grand-parent i n the e n d . If you
would like to v i s i t an o l d
person once in a w h i l e , we
can put y o u i n touch with
somebody.
Blood-Do ning:-
I C C A G is a l s o responsible
for the blood-doning s e s s i o n s
held i n C o l l e g e , and i s badly
in need of somebody to take
over the organisation of this.
If y o u are interested contact
Dave Millard or myself (Cheryl
Whiffin). T h i s activity helps
save people's lives and i s
well-worth supporting if y o u
c a n . Whilst we're o n the
subject, a f e w weeks ago I C
donated 394 pints of blood —
many thanks to those who
helped.
I C C A G a l s o needs a
publicity officer to do posters
for the various events; a n d
above a l l we need d r i v e r s . If
you are over 2 1 , and fancy

Thumbs up for
January travel
T h e setting up of a London
Student Travel Bureau ( L S T B ) ,
as put forward by ex—IC
president Trevor P h i l l i p s three
weeks a g o to replace the
liquidated N U S T r a v e l , took a
step towards inception this
week.
Representatives from the
student unions who would run
the Bureau's offices — at I C ,
University of London Union &
Queen Mary C o l l e g e — met two
main travel companies S A T A
(who operate a i r flights) a n d
Transalpino (who operate
train travel).
T h e meeting, on Wednesday,
agreed details to supply the
Bureau with S A T A and T r a n s -
alpino s e r v i c e s . Negotiations
with B r i t i s h R a i l to s e l l their
R a i l c a r d have already been
s u c c e s s f u l l y c o n c l u d e d . I C U
president N i c k B r a y s h a w , w h o
attended the meeting, s a i d that
the w a y i s now open for a
viable L S T D . A few minor
operators have yet to be seen
and the final go-ahead c o u l d
be given late next week. If
this happens the I C travel
office could re-open i n
January.
Union riot
E i g h t people were taken to
hospital at the weekend
following a five minute battle
between rival Turkish students
at IC U n i o n .
The trouble began during
the a l l d a y annual conference
of the left wing T u r k i s h
Federation of Students in the
U n i o n Lower Refectory last
Sunday. A right w i n g group
of students stormedthe U n i o n
building just after noon, a n d
tried t o get into the Refectory.
T h e i r w a y w a s barred by
the students i n there w h o
r e s i s t e d the onslaught with
s t i c k s , chairs a n d later
bottles. Damage to the Union
included the l o s s of several
panes o f glass to the doors
of the Union foyer, and the
loss o f a brass door handle to
the same.
The F e d e r a t i o n have
offered to pay for the damage,
and have already forfeited
their £50 deposit on the room
booking.
Although doubts exist to
the identity of the attackers,
'The group inside the building
looked a s though they expected
trouble' s a i d one eyewitness
in B e i t H a l l .
The battle lasted five
minutes after w h i c h the
attackers withdrew. P o l i c e —
alerted by C o l l e g e security —
arrived o n the scene soon
afterwards.
The police requested that
the meeting c l o s e promptly.
T h i s it d i d at 2pm, eight
hours ahead of s c h e d u l e .
None of the c a s u a l t i e s
was retained overnight i n St
Stephen's h o s p i t a l .

Non—Life s c i e n t i s t s taking
advantage of the low prices of
the B o t / Z o o common room are
requested to observe the
recently posted notices con-
cerning congestion of the T e a
Room. I t ' s operation depends
entirely on s m a l l - s c a l e organ-
isation by a group of volunteers
from within the d i v i s i o n .
So, we're sorry, but, what-
ever your w i s h e s , the opening
of this T e a Room to everybody
wouldn't work — a s . t h e
increased time demand would
end the voluntary b a s i s and
prices would shoot up. P l e a s e
don't spoil the facility for our
own members, or make it
necessary for u s to i s s u e
membership c a r d s (we'll
w i l l i n g l y advise y o u on
starting up a similar system!)
