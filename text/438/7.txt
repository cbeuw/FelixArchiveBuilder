An alternative plan from Professor Wiggins & Stephen Gardiner
Human habitation
for students
People have begun to hate universities. If you doubt t h i s ,
look at the newspapers — empty of understanding of what
universities do, and full of malice towards'students, invariably
imagined in a state of parasitical dependence on t h e ' long
suffering taxpayer. The cut-back in university expenditure which
started w e l l before the squeeze, is just one reflection of the
state of public opinion.
There are many reasons for this view of u s . One reason is the
self-absorption of universities. The most perfect expression of
the self-centredness of London University is its building p o l i c y .
The Sunday T i m e s for 10th August 1969 wrote:
" L o n d o n U n i v e r s i t y , whose reputation for philistinism w a s
already secure, has struck its shrewdest blow yet against the
forces of beauty and pleasure .... Woburn Square is gone .... it is
gone by the w i l l of what is supposed to be a great seat of
learning and culture financed by public money and spurred on by
good intention. It is worse than a crime. It is a folly. A l l those
responsible .... should be a s h a m e d . "
But conservationists are not the only people who distrust the
U n i v e r s i t y . People who care about modern architecture are
equally concerned. Apart from the Royal C o l l e g e of Art, what
good building has the University put up in Kensington? T h e
Secretary of the R o y a l F i n e Arts Commission once wrote t o
Norman and Dawbarn, architects then as now to Imperial C o l l e g e ,
" T h e quality of the design (of the IC campus) seems to
express a great commercial concern rather than a seat of learning
and r e s e a r c h . "
Will the new Huxley building in Queens Gate refute this
charge?
There are conservationists and there are connoisseurs of
architecture, and there are neighbours overshadowed and ignored.
But there is yet another group who find I C ' s present buildings
wanting — the students themselves, who complain about t h e
isolation which has resulted from the plan you find at L i n s t e a d
H a l l , four rooms to a c e l l with virtually no other reference point
between the c e l l and the whole building. The remedy for this is
not another plunge into the unknown — a hotel version of the
same unsuccessful building form. What is needed is a way of
building which has proved its ability to answer to the needs of
a community.
That at least was the possibility I envisaged, and which the
shame I have long felt for the University, prompted me to
commission Stephen Gardiner to explore, when the C o l l e g e
unveiled its plan to e n c l o s e P r i n c e s Gardens again, and to
overwhelm with yet more high buildings the space and air which
the square had accidentally got from the clearance of its E a s t
s i d e . The guidelines I gave Stephen Gardiner were, first, the
need to design an alternative which students would be happy in;
second, the position of the site in the existing square; third, the
special character of the neighbourhood as a whole. He drew the
drawings which can be found in the Union Office. He writes
about his scheme:
" T h e alternative to a high-rise concrete s l a b block extending
Linstead H a l l northwards (with inevitable internal central
corridor, lifts and uniform windows), is a scheme with low
buiIdingsspreading across the whole site between E n n i s m o r e
Gardens Mews and the hedge which marks the beginning of the
square. T h i s means a series of domestic s c a l e buildings w h i c h
can be arranged to make a series of courts between three and
four storeys high. The court, like the street terrace, is a
building form which has been tried and enjoyed over c e n t u r i e s ,
whereas the high-rise building form has come to be rejected
within the space of one generation. The court makes a focus for
living and working. It brings people together round a community
space. People can see each other, or are aware of the presence
of their neighbours. T h i s makes for a friendly, secure s o c i e t y .
" T h e brief asked us to provide the maximum number of
students that was architecturally acceptable for the s i t e . We
find that we can house 280 (and 300 if we build over the boiler
house rather than build a Common Room there). We do not like
the idea of double rooms for students but, simply for purposes
of showing what an alternative to the official scheme would look
like, we have reluctantly followed the C o l l e g e ' s own o v e r a l i
ratio of single to double rooms.
" O b v i o u s l y we have to live with the economics of this
problem. For a rather smaller number of students, we could have
designed a better scheme with even less of the feel of " s t u d e n t
b u i l d i n g s " . But even with the present number of rooms, ours
would be very unlike most of the student housing we have seen
in London, e s p e c i a l l y when the small gardens established them-
s e l v e s . (If you doubt the beauty or utility of small gardens like
these, walk around in the C i t y , eg between Carter Lane and the
River, and see what such spaces can be like, and how much
people value them.)
" T a k i n g the three phases together, the capacity of our
scheme is the same as the C o l l e g e ' s if, when the C o l l e g e seek
planning permission for P h a s e III in the 1980s, the C i t y C o u n c i l
insists on enforcing daylighting regulations and removes three
storeys ( s 8 0 students).
" T h e guidelines of the e x i s t i n g square and the a d j o i n i n g
mews streets of the neighbourhood confirm the Tightness of
courts among buildings. The square contains a large garden and
the courts are like echoes of this garden. They continue it as
smaller gardens. At the same time, it has to be remembered that
when this Victorian square was built over a hundred years ago it
was all of one s t u c c o piece, and the trees were s a p l i n g s . It was
never a s p a c i o u s square, but one thing saved it. The South s i d e
was built lower than the E a s t and West s i d e s . (You can see one
or two of the remaining houses at the South-west corner.) T h e
square was tilted to the midday s u n . That advantage is gone with
the great height of the rebuilding to the South. It follows that any
proposal to c l o s e the E a s t side, and to cut out light, must be
avoided. Such enclosure can only be avoided by low b u i l d i n g s ,
and by treating L i n s t e a d H a l l as a large free standing object —
with an effect which would be thoroughly typical of Kensington.
"Without going into a maze of detail, there is another import-
ant factor which influenced our design, and this was the need to
relate the level of the site to the level of the square. At the same
time, the level of our rooflines had to match the level of the
mews roofline. T h e s e two things were achieved in one move —
by raising the level of our site ( at present one storey below that
of the square) by four feet. The section - and thus the staircase
plan with two rooms off every landing — evolved from this move.
We use a mezzanine section where the lower ground floor starts
from the present level of the site and our entrance starts from
the new l e v e l . It sounds complicated but is really very s i m p l e ,
as a glance at our drawings w i l l show. The traditional c o l l e g e
staircase plan with between 14 to 20 students off it creates a
pleasant domestic arrangement which leads to roof gardens at
the top. T h e s e , like the courts below, unify the b l o c k s , and
relate them to the square a s a whole.
" T h e roof gardens provide a communal space for the inhabit-
ants of each block. T h e courts are a place where a l l the students
in the scheme and from elsewhere would come across one
another in a natural way as they do in countless other universities
— Cambridge, Durham, Oxford, Bologna, Harvard, C r a c o w ,
Amsterdam, Prague, (to name but a few).
" T h e r e are people who disagree with the idea that the back
of Ennismore Gardens could define the western side of P r i n c e s
Square. They d i s l i k e these b a c k s . But these very people would
condemn half the students in the official scheme to look c l o s e
up on no other view than the one they say they d i s l i k e . Our
alternative would involve planting trees and grass - in making
something which would be good to look at and live i n .
"I am sorry the Union E x e c u t i v e did not invite me to their
meeting to explain our drawings, which they have misunderstood
in certain important w a y s , or respond to a further suggestion of
a meeting with students. A letter of clarification of the drawings
was sent to Mr Brayshaw on 16th October, which I hope he w i l l
show to any students who are interested in problems ot domestic
or communal a r c h i t e c t u r e . "
When Stephen Gardiner had made h i s drawings we had them
costed by the quantity surveyor who had acted for the L i n s t e a d
Hall building. Our building costs slightly less than the C o l l e g e ' s
at Phase One and 19% less per student housed at P h a s e s T w o
and Three. What is more, the low-rise alternative would admit of
piecemeal additions after Phase One, and would enable the
C o l l e g e to complete student accommodation gradually with the
help of small benefactions. The plan is f l e x i b l e . It is to be
favoured if what the C o l l e g e really wants is to accommodate a s
many students as soon as p o s s i b l e .
There is something for a technologist to think about in these
economic findings. The ugly solution need not b e the cheap one,
and the cheap solution need not be the ugly one. The time is
coming when people w i l l require technologists to find solutions
which combine simplicity with beauty and economy and congruity
to the needs of everyday life. The P r i n c e s Gardens s c h e m e
combines mediocrity and defiance of neighbourhood with very
high cost - money which would be better spent providing more
student accommodation here and now.
I think people would stop talking about the need to e n c l o s e
the square and undo the fortuitous benefits of the demolition of
the E a s t side of P r i n c e s Gardens if they would try to think what
things would be like on the ground when the Phase Three block,
daylighting infringements and a l l , is finished, and when the
process which began with alocking of the light from the South
is completed. In a situation like this, it is the emptiest formalism
to speak of the c l a s s i c qualities of London squares in connexion
with P r i n c e s Gardens. Consider Bedford square: It is wider in
extent and lower on all s i d e s — as well as complete. In P r i n c e s
Gardens, where so much has gone wrong already, what is needed
is an architectural idea w h i c h w i l l make the best of what remains:
a sense of space, and light from the E a s t . A s it is, if the
C o l l e g e has its own way, the gardens w i l l be overwhelmed — and
by a building which I have yet to find any member of Imperial
College c a l l beautiful.
Let me end where I began. In the Universities we have to
learn to live in harmony with the city, e l s e we shall eventually
be starved out of the city. I leave to L e i b n i z , a philosopher whom
I think I c a n rely on Imperial C o l l e g e to respect as co-inventor
with Newton of the infinitestimal c a l c u l u s , the last word on what
sort of loss that w i l l be for the community of learning.
" . . . . t h u s a new maxim — which goes completely against the
old one has become necessary; namely that students and
scholars should participate as much as possible and be as
much as they can with people and in the w o r l d . "
