THE KNIGHTSBRIDGE ASSOCIATION'S ALTERNATIVE P L A N x x x x ^ ^
College is living in
Rip Van Winkle land
The Knightsbridge A s s o c i a t i o n is a typical local amenity
society brought to life by "960's legislation as a consultative
body to the planning authority, Westminster City C o u n c i l , for
developement within its area.
About a generation ago Imperial College acquired P r i n c e s
Gardens and with it permission to construct term-time hostels
and vacation-time hotels. Thus the C o l l e g e received permission
to demolish the houses in Princes Gardens in the days before
public consultation. One can now hypothesize that a better
solution might have been to house students in the central
College area, thereby enlivening the campus deserted after the
d a y ' s work.
In the last two years the College has made application to
increase the existing student population in P r i n c e s Gardens from
600 to 1500, though the subsequent listing (by the Dept of
Environment of Nos 8 to 15 reduced the increase to 600 persons.
During these proceedings the A s s o c i a t i o n has sought to co-
operate with the College to produce a solution acceptable to its
neighbours: and repeatedly the C o l l e g e has d e c l i n e d .
It has to be said that after a decade of experience, neighbours
to the Halls are confident that what amounts to a virtual replica
extension of Linstead Hall would result in a sharp deterioration
of desirable standards of a normal domestic environment. Indeed
we believe that any new building should have a domestic rather
than hotel emphasis. To many it seems that the C o l l e g e , in
pursuing its 20 year old plan, is more like R i p Van Winkle than
a University in the forefront of s c i e n t i f i c development and
equipped with an industrial sociology department.
This summer, the Knightsbridge A s s o c i a t i o n , challenged to
make constructive proposals, very reluctantly set about producing
its own scheme. At root we believe it necessary to retain the
residential area in the South Kensington mix, to avoid not only a
Bloomsbury death, but the sort of dangers of central city d i s -
integration that have been emphasized by the Planning Minister
and his predecessor: there are many ominous examples to be
avoided if the enormous exodus from London of those in search
of better living conditions is to be stemmed.
Overcrowding is one of the repulsive features of city life:
certainly the College has already overtopped the historic density
of its own (and the adjoining) Square. Proposals to increase it
would account for one quarter of the whole of Knightsbridge
simply invite resistance. Our scheme then is designed to mend
the gaps in Princes Gardens with useful buildings to house an
optimum and not just a maximum additional population,
On the east side our proposal includes a car park in the
existing basement, decked over with 3 tennis courts (with an a l l
weather finish), and a series of covered games courts with
maisonettes above accommodating a student population of 72.
Other f a c i l i t i e s , including a medical centre and a creche, are

located in several storeys above the existing boiler house. To
the east of Linstead H a l l open car parking would be obscured by
a pergola.
In our view, a building four storeys in height is sufficient to
blanket from sight the back of Ennismore Gardens terrace.
Continuing to use the materials of the original builders — brick
and stucco — the style would balance the mews design and the
articulations of its main street V i c t o r i a n neighbours.
On the north side, some sixty students would be accommodated
in a low rise building fronted by a double storey conservatory
common room. Apart from the attractiveness of such a feature
the proposal is aimed at satisfying the Planning A u t h o r i t y ' s
desire to see design sympathetic to its Victorian surrounds.
Such a height would continue the line of the heavily emphasised
porticos: the exposed terrace end would mimic features from its
main facade.
Conceptual design of student halls of residence has made
radical progress in the last 20 years: our own design, put
forward soley in outline, incorporates this progress and we are
confident it would meet with the approval of those whom it is
intended to accommodate.

THE WARDENS' VIEWS
More open discussion
needed
A model of College proposals for an extension to Linstead Hall.
10 years ago when plans for the present Linstead Hall were
being drawn up, its warden designate, C i v i l Engineer Dr P a u l
Minton, was deeply involved in consultations with the C o l l e g e
architects. Along with then Domestic Bursar, Carl Seaford,and
Senior Warden Mr Stephenson — his equivalent now would be the
College Senior Tutor — Dr Minton spent a considerable time
formulating L i n s t e a d ' s d e s i g n . He was involved in the planning
from the early stages, something which has not happened with
the present warden, Dr C a r a b i n e , over the extension plans.
In fact whilst Dr Carabine has been involved with the Working
Party on the Linstead Extension he has only been so s i n c e just
you draw the lines'
of the benefaction, Mr D a v i e s said there was 'no consultation
about the precise terms of the benefaction'.
A s to whether the money donated could be used for a new hall
rather than an extension he pointed out that as the same bene-
factor had given the money for the original Linstead H a l l , 'not
un-naturally he or she envisagedan extension to Linstead and
College did not quarrel with that.'
Questioned if C o l l e g e had asked the benificiary to change any
conditions he commented that 'College had informed benefactor
about the rejection of planning permission.'
Mr Davies refuted the suggestion that the views of the Knights-
bridge A s s o c i a t i o n (KA) had not been taken into account.
'College has had meetings with KA and some of the points they
raised have been met.'
Furthermore, he emphasised that although C o l l e g e had to
have 'things done fast', this in no way implied that there was
inadequate consultation or that the urgency was a cause of the
ultimate rejection of the plans.
He was sure that the composition of the Working Party w a s
adequate. He added 'there has to be a limit as to the numbers
involved in the planning process. It's a question of where you
draw the lines in this matter.'
He further pointed out that Dr Ken Weale — C o l l e g e Tutor and
an ex-warden-had been involved with the working party from the
beginning. The inclusion of Dr Carabine was not implied because
he was the present warden. Wardenship has a tenure of five years
and Dr Carabine need not necessarily be the warden when the
extension is opened.
Mr Davies was not prepared to comment on the findings of the
Royal F i n e Art Committee, or on possible C o l l e g e policy a s
seen in the new brief for the architects. He felt that it would be
inappropriate as the Governor's w i l l d i s c u s s the question of the
Linstead Hall extension at their meeting a week today.

after the time the plans had been submitted to C o l l e g e by the
architects Norman and Dawbarn. H i s role was as observer in
attendance, a s s e s s i n g the plans and presenting any points
raised by the Linstead Hall Committee.
Me feels the Working Party have been lumbered with a plan
which is, in essence, a repeat of the Northside plan for a hall
above the sports centre (the plan was subsequently dropped
because the foundations of the centre were not suitable).
He has never really been happy with the proposals for an
extension, favouring the idea of a separate h a l l . Initially, he
raised this with the Working Party where the idea received some
sympathy. But the terms of the benefaction appeared to be
e x p l i c i t , requiring an extension to Linstead H a l l .
The Linstead Hail Committee did not react favourably to the
Working Party's proposal e'ther; they did so on the grounds that
there would be a large number of students in the present common
rooms, and that these would be the only a c c e s s to the new
building. Dr Carabine conveyed this to the Working Party, along
w:
th modifc;
ations made by Paul Jowitt, then sub-warden of
Linstead and himself a C i v i l E n g i n e e r . These modifications
included the provision of an entrance at ground l e v e l . T h e s e
modifications were accepted by the Working Party.
Dr Carabine emphasises that his c r i t i c i s m is not really of the
architects plans — as long as the building is functional and
attractive - but of the brief presented to Norman and Dawbarn
and the manner in which it was drawn up. He recognises that the
College had a tight schedule, being required to start building by
January 1977. However, he feels that 'fo some extent, consult-
ation within College was curtailed at very early stages when
perhaps it would have been of most value.'
The Working Party did not d i s c u s s the Knightbridge A s s o c i a -
tion or Professor Wiggins' alternative plans, Dr Carabine s a i d .
For various reasons they have not met s i n c e J u l y .
He expressed relief on hearing of the extension of the time
limit, and sees it as providing an opportunity for further d i s -
c u s s i o n . T h i s could centre around both the type of residential
unit required and the w i s h e s of outside groups, e s p e c i a l l y the
Knightsbridge A s s o c i a t i o n and Westminster City C o u n c i l . He
thinks there is a need for involving students wardens and
administration in any future working party to produce a concept
of residence suitable for everyone.
On the suggestion of an open meeting on the subject, Dr
Carabine commented that it might be a good idea if there were
enough people interested. 'After all', he said, 'If a competent
firm of architects have not managed to produce an acceptable
building within their brief, then it indicates that one ought to go
back and discuss the constraints', (of the brief).
He felt it was pointless to speculate on alternatives at this
stage - in fact he did not know the C o l l e g e plan had been re-
jected until it was published in F E L I X - but thought the con-
sultation with the Fine Arts Commission was good since 'an
aesthetic consideration is needed a t this stage.'
Dr Carabine's call for more d i s c u s s i o n was echoed by Mr
Frank Potter, Warden of Keogh H a l l , Southside and a former warden
of L i n s t e a d . He does 'not know how one can go ahead without
more discussion.' He sees the extra year as giving a chance for
a 'new beginning' with all parties, including students and
wardens, involved in consultation.
His personal opinion of the design of the extension was that
it was incongruous with the present Linstead H a l l . He also felt
that management problems would arise and there was the p o s s -
ibility that a requirement of 'double sittings' at meals would
result in some students not feeling part of L i n s t e a d .
Mr Potter is 'not keen' on the idea of an open meeting. He
favours quiet d i s c u s s i o n , d i s c u s s i o n which he feels is now
absolutely necessary.
