Conference: The heart of
NUS operations
A s y o u are reading this i l l u s t r i o u s
column, a band of eight intripid delegates
from IC w i l l be making their way to the
Winter Gardens B l a c k p o o l for the twice
yearly NUS Conference.
For those of you who are unaware,
NUS Conferences are the ruling body
of N U S and consist of delegates from
a l l c o l l e g e s within N U S . The number of
delegates per c o l l e g e i s apportioned
according to the number of full time
students attending each c o l l e g e .
ICU w i l l be sending 5 delegates who
w i l l take part in deciding both N U S policy
next year and how the NUS exec spend
their monev
Autopsy on NUS Travel
At this cunierence the main topic of
debate w i l l be the c o l l a p s e of N U S
Services and many motions have been
submitted on this controversial subject.
Apart from the motions c a l l i n g for t h e
nationalisation of N U S Travel and s o on,
there are some reasonable ammendments,
most of which seek to ensure that the

a secretary?
'Secretaries are a waste of time'.'60%
ot secretaries are status symbols... they
beget the hieracchial system where
everyone worries about the thickness of
the carpet, the size ot the office and the
shortness ot the secretaries' skirts'.
(Evening Standard, 22nd November)
I am now well into my 2nd year of
training to be a " s t a t u s s y m b o l " . I've
been taught in T P (nothing to do with
you great author) about the good secretary:
hopefully by the summer I will have
speeds of 120/100 wpm (words per
minute - dumbo!) in E n g l i s h / F r e n c h
shortand, and 6 0 / 5 0 wpm in typing. I
w i l l have become a responsible, inde-
pendent worker, relieving my boss of h i s
work burden. I w i l l type h i s letters,
arrange appointments for him, deal with
unwanted v i s i t o r s . I w i l l be punctual,
honest, well-dressed and have a sense
of humour.
T h a t ' s not being a status s y s m b o l . It's
hard work. Secretaries are a very v i t a l
part of business life. They are dedicating
their life to make the b o s s ' s easier — if
he doesn't take advantage of the help
offered, more fool h e . Indeed there is a
certain amount of truth in the statement:
'British executives need to be trained in
the proper use of a secretary'.
On Tuesday, November 14th we a r e
going Carol singing with Gui Ids — detai Is
from IF U n i o n . I hope to s e e a s many
status symbols there as p o s s i b l e (and s o
do G u i l d s ) .

remaining s e r v i c e s (NUS Marketing a n d
Endsleigh Insurance) remain student
controlled and profitable.
The other financial debate w i l l be
concerned with the NUS estimates f o r
next year. These outline in some detail
how the executive w i l l spend their
money. A s most of you w i l l know N U S
is in some financial difficulties due t o
loosing £43,000 when travel went bust
(because of an off-set agreement w i t h
the bank). T h i s , together with the
recent spate of Scottish d i s a f f i l i a t i o n s ,
means that NUS w i l l have very little to
spend on campaigns next year.
ICU says cut International w

k
The ICU delegation w i l l be proposing
that a l l the money N U S currently spends
on International work (Chi le, South A f r i c a ,
Portugal etc) i s transfered to the more
important domestic campaigns such a s
Grants, fees, s o c i a l security and
overseas students.
The other motions to be d i s c u s s e d
are on Grants, Overseas Students, R a c i a l -
ism, South A f r i c a and the NUS C o n -
stitution. On the Constitution motion
IC has put an ammendment c a l l i n g for the
introduction o f direct e l e c t i o n s for t h e
NUS executive. T h i s unfortunately stands
very little chance of being a c c e p t e d .
ICU has a l s o put ammendments in on
South A f r i c a and Grants — the Grants
ammendment c a l l i n g for the abolition of
the parental contribution and discretionary
awards a s the main aims for next year's
grants campaign.
The rest of the business of Conference
is taken up with the executive report of
what they have done in the past year.
All night bars.
T h i s may sound a heavy workload and
conference is in s e s s i o n from 9am t i l l
12 midnight to get most business d i s -
cussed — the only compensation is that
the bars don't c l o s e until 6aml
F i n a l l y , following last w e e k ' s incred-

Williams about fees, I'd like to thank the
people who did most of the hard work in
collecting those signatures — the
Departmental Representatives.

Well that's one motion, which would
probably be carried quite e a s i l y by I C ' s
recently revived Debating Society. T h e
