Diving medals reward versatile IG efforts
Tenpin Bowling
Alcohol rules out marathon success
Once again the versatility
of the members of I C Swimming
and Water-polo C l u b w a s put
to test, with swimming,
diving and water-polo compet-
itions a l l in the space of one
week. Although good perform-
ances were recorded, it w a s
only i n the diving pool that I C
hit the medal traiL
Water-polo

Meanwhile, on the swimming
front, a small I C contingent
was battling its w a y through
heats of the U L U Swimming

strong L a d i e s ' team, b e i n g

Finals
^Unfortunately t h e I C
swimmers were unable to
repeat this performance. In the
440yds freestyle Rory s e t
the i n i t i a l pace but w a s
eventually overtaken and
forced into third p l a c e , while
John comfortably f i n i s h e d
sixth with a point for I C , T h e
individual medley produced a
similar result, this ' time
F r a n c o i s gaining third p l a c e
and John coming i n fifth.
In the blue ribbon event,
the 100yds freestyle, R o r y
lost h i s chance to w i n the
title three years running on
the final turn and had to be
content with fourth place
The evening was completed
with the team r e l a y s . T h e
medley team, c o n s i s t i n g of
Ian Shott, F r a n c o i s , Rory and
John, finished w e l l down the
field against some strong
opposition. However certain
members were s a v i n g their
energy for one final effort i n
the freesytle relay and the I C
team of R o r y , F r a n c o i s , John
and Dave Lowther obtained a
creditable second p l a c e .
E x c e s s merriment and a
tiring 12 hour marathon bowl
accounted for some rather
mediocre ten p i n bowling
results last weekend. A t one
stage the I C 2nds beat the I C
l s t — such was the state of
the teams. ;
On Saturday the club h a d
bravely made their w a y t o
Birmingham for the annual
Brum Marathon — 12 hours
non-stop bowling and drinking.
The last f e w members of the
team really caught the spirit
of the o c c a s i o n by entering
with a barrel of beer. T h i s
provoked a large cheer from
the crowd.
The man of the match must
be N i c k Gascoigne,-who, under
the ""affluence of i n c o h o l '
staggered and c o l l a p s e d to
the line more often than
anyone e l s e .
It was here that the seconds
beat the f i r s t s . Although
Simon Spurrier hit the gate
and suffer the penalty o f 5 0
pins, the marathon was worth-
