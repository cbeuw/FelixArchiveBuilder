4 - F E L I X , - D E C E M B E R 10th 1976
Welcome back to the article which
has become the king-pin of F E L I X (by
virtue of its regular absence). A couple
of important items to mention, s o :
Tuition fees
The Union has been anything but
dormant on this issue. F i r s t l y R i c k and
Hugh posted nearly 1,300 letters through
Shirley Williams' letter box and got an
interview on L B C , a paragraph in the
D a i l y Telegraph and a c u p of tea from
Shirley. Next, the matter is due to be
d i s c u s s e d within college during thei
next week or t w o , culminating in the
governors having to decide what level of
fees to charge next s e s s i o n .
PRES
CUTTINGS
by IC Union
President
Nick Brayshaw
I N E E D : - Information from any student
who i s going to find himself in financial
difficulty next year, or may even be
forced to leave due to the level of f e e s .
Any info w i l l be treated in the strictest
confidence — I am not interested in
names, merely s t a t i s t i c s , s o for heaven's
sake let me know on internal 3915. It's
'or your benefit.
Refectories
The Refectory Committee decided (in
its wisdom) to a) use the regulating
mechanism (set up by the governors) r o r e
regulari ly.
b) Increases across the board by 2% from
January ' 7 7 .
c) Increases of 5% on a l l functions.
The sheer blind stupidity of the
people responsible for thinking up and
agreeing with these suggestions (and
that goes a l l the way up the c o l l e g e
hierarchy) leaves me s p e e c h l e s s . T h i s
term the takings a r e up by approx 15%
which represents a 5% increase in profit
ratios (approx). T h i s rise is largely
due to the lack of bad publicity in t h e
U n i o n ' s media. T h i s rise in takings c a n
be zapped to smithereems by a c o u p l e
of articles in F E L I X s o anyone who h a s
a say with the governor's ought to do
some fast talking!!
NUS Referendum
The referendum w i l l not be at the
same time a s the sabbatical e l e c t i o n s ,
you fat-head Dewey. That was never
said,suggested or agreed by the meeting.
What was agreed w a s that the referendum
w i l l be held in the spring term. It would
appear that the most s e n s i b l e time to
hold this referendum is before the
sabbatical elections s o that they do not
degenerate into a question of " i n or
o u t " . There are far more important i s s u e s
to elect a president for than whether we
stay in NUS or not.
WHITE
LIES

IC Union Hon.Sec.
A l l you have to do is s a y " Y o u ' r e
Chalky White of the D a i l y Mirror and I
c l a i m my £ 5 " , no, no, no I mean " I ' m a
Reciprocal Member of your Union and I
would like to use your f a c i l i t i e s " . Don't,
however, whatever you do, forget to bring
your authorised IC Union Card with you.
Situation Vacant
There is a vacancy tor the post of
Union Fairy.
The rates are the standard Union
rates ie £1 per hour a n d the working
conditions are excellent.
Anyone w i l l i n g to stand on the t o p
of the Union Office Christmas Tree for
the next month should contact the
nearest pschiatrist of Happy Farm or
both.
Christmas Cards & N
e
w Year's Eve
Just a reminder to a l l you lovely
people to send me a Christmas Card (one
from each of you, that is!) —you know the
address Chalky, IC Union, Imperial
College, London SW7. May I extend a n
open invitation to a celebration of t h e
New Y e a r : Meet y o u a l l in the Union
Bar on the evening of Friday 31st
December from whence, after suitable
refreshment, we shall wend our way to
Trafalgar Square where w e s h a l l a l l
catch pneumonia from having a late bath.
Have a good Christmas and a Happy
New Y e a r . Take care and s o long.
Seeing a s y o u w i l l a l l shortly be
toddling off to Bermuda or St M o r i t z -
under-Lyme for your Christmas H o l s , this
had better be le fin in a r t i c l e s a s IF'ers
would s a y .
Rail Cards
Soon after having had my article run
off last week I discovered that Rail Cards
are now available over the counter at an
outlet in Euston Mainline Station. A g a i n ,
bring along two passport s i z e photos,
you authorised Union Card and £6.50.
NUS Referendum
On Tuesday March 8th there w i l l be a
debate on the many and varied a s p e c t s /
pro and cons of membership of N U S .
F r d a y w i l l s e e (hopefully) a spread in
F E L I X on the same subject and then,
coincident with the Sabbatical O f f i c e r s '
and Deputy President's elections (on
Monday 14th and Tuesday 15th) w i l l be
the secret ballot. I feel that the time
between the debate and the referendum i s
very necessary in order to enable every-
body to fully examine and a n a l y s e t h e
situation.

r Fete
The Rag Committee is currently in the
process of organising a Summer Fete for
Saturday May 7th ie the second Saturday
o f
the Summer Term. T h i s extravaganza

be opened by a suitable dignatory. T h e
whole event i s to be finished off with a
bar-b-que and a d i s c o in the e v e n i n g .
A l l w e need now is your help and a
promise from big (or Sir Brian) that it
won't rain.
If you are interested in helping t o
get this shindig on the road then please
drop in and s e e me or drop a line, v i a

Election Fever
The competitors are on their marks, the
starter is poised (that's me — s w o o n ,
swoon) and they're off ...
W H A T UNION P O S T A R E YOU GOING
T O S T A N D F O R N E X T Y E A R ?
The Christmas V a c . i s upon us and a l l
there is left to do is to s i t around, s t i c k
a pin into the Union B y - L a w s , ' L i s t of
O f f i c e r s ' , and s a y " w e l l if that idiot c a n
do the job, why the hell can't I ? "
"Indeed why not, Sir/Madam!" I reply.
Think hard on the subject, once y o u
come back after the v a c . the second term
w i l l flash by and before you know it
Thunderbolt Sproggins w i l l be elected to
the post you're s t i l l diddering about. T h e
best thing to do is talk to the present
holder of the post or me (Isn't it
exciting! Scream!) c o s I'm dead nosey!

p Reciprocal Agreements
Somewhere in this F E L I X , hopefully
below this article, you w i l l find a list of
C o l l e g e s and U n i v e r s i t i e s with whom' IC
Union has a Reciprocal Membership
Agreement. T h i s agreement is such that
we c a n use their f a c i l i t i e s and vice
versa whenever either be in the locality,
if you see what I mean.
Anyway, what it boils down to i s that
if you look through the list and d i s c o v e r
the Wolfgang J . F l y w h e e l C o l l e g e of
P h y s i c a l Education for young l a d i e s
which just happens to back onto your
country retreat — then you c a n use this
agreement and go and have a s w i l l in
their bar or join their Hatha Rugby C l u b .
