The role of a Graduate Manager is to focus on the financial needs of recent
graduates who are now in full-time employment. Jenny Thomson,
Graduate Manager at South Kensington can offer a wide
range of professional support, help and guidance to graduates
who are earning a regular salary for the first time.
Many graduates still owe money from their student days.
Jenny will provide you with a more personal service based
upon your individual needs. She will help with any financial
difficulties you may encounter and give full details of the
Barclays Graduate Package including overdrafts* and loans*
at rates preferential to those normally offered by Barclays.
What's more, Barclays provides this special service entirely free of charge.
*To apply for an overdraft or loan you must be 18 or over (20 in Jersey). Barclays is a responsible lender and
when considering your application for borrowing your financial circumstances will be appraised. And
remember, if you should run into difficulties please contact us immediately.
