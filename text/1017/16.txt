It's the usual selection of the good, bad, ugly, slightly spotty,
downright rude and occasionally twee. James Thomson, of
DoCl fame, returns for his second bite at rotation.
Tintin got his light brown plus fours out, left Snowy at a
kennel and headed down to the Royal Academy for their
Nicolas Poussin exhibition [at the start of a busy week].
An all action music team splits three separate ways, gets lost,
jumps on and off guest lists but finally returns. Tintin tackles
the throwing muses, Owain clutches free kitten to his
bosom while Vik smiles at the new dillion fence Ip.
Taking her cues from the Word could be dodgy but Fiona
knows her bits from her pieces ... fluffy bras, vpls and all...
Gnash, gnash toothies are back. Anne Rice's [via Neil Jordan]
vampire classic hits the screams near us all. Tintin checked
out interviews with the vampires' delusions of grandeur
whilst Jenny Ho dugs around that shallow grave.
You continue to be served by the anonymous gastrognome of
greatness, yeap AC goes 'yummy' down at Oguiska.

Most gospel soul music now
seems to have forgotten its roots,
ravaged by the unstoppable
march of technology. This is no
no musici. .-, and way
overlong. Why do they waste cds
with this crap?

The Martyrdom of St. Erasmus [1628-29]
The most arresting sight in this
exhibition is the first painting on
show. One entering the circular
anteroom at the Royal Academy,
down looms Poussin's the martyr-
dom of st. erasmus. A christlike
figure falls out of the canvas as a
group of men crowd about the
saint. They are slowly pulling out
his intestines and winding them
around a windlass. It's not what
you expect from Nicolas Poussin,
(1594-1665), considered the
greatest French painter of his age.
Yet the choice of subject is not at
variance with the rest of the
exhibition. After failing to win
public acclaim with this work (it was
inconceivably ordered as an altar-
piece), Poussin had to paint for
private patrons. Therefore he
possessed a much freer rein to
express his own choice of topics
than other artists of his day.
Although born in France,
Poussin spent most of his working
life in Rome, drawing heavily on
the Renaissance and antiquity as
subject matter. Indeed of the nine
galleries making up this exhibition
all but one fall into the categories
of biblical or scenes from antiquity.
Perhaps it was his early work
that is now most admired. Taking
such stories as Venus and Adonis
and Echo and Narcissus, Poussin
painted scenes of tragic and futile
humanism. Within such works,
rivers are personified, the cherubic
putti float about the skies dropping
flowers and satyrs drunkenly fool
with bacchante. To that extent both
the stories and Poussin's portrayals
of them are laced with the wiff of
decadence. This too is reflected in
the biblical scenes as the classical
touches are introduced as alle-
gories ie in the triumph of david a
winged victory hands him an oak
wreath as cupid plays the harp!
However Poussin is best known
for his classical landscapes. They
still retain the previous themes but
enhance them by placing the much
smaller figures within the realm of
nature. Yet for Poussin this nature
was as domestic as the architec-
tural details he often used both on
fore and backgrounds. It has been
well said that his world was "all
solid, cubes and cones of landscape
and cloud ... everything remains
graspable by man".
The last works he carried out
were a series on the four seasons
which highlighted biblical themes
such as winter - the deluge. It was
an appropriate end to his career.
Yet Poussin seems to be best
placed as a precursor to others.
Certainly this is an interesting
exhibition but this would seem to
be more for historical reasons than
the deeper excitements that are
generally associated with Art. 0
