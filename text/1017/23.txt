IC Mens 1st vs Royal Free Hospital
The first match of the new year
brought us all back together for
an important clash. The lack of
fitness, caused by too much
turkey and not enough exertion
(if any), meant the defence was
very solid, but stationary,
especially the goalie. The
opposition, sporting most
fashionable 'Rupert the Bear'
shorts, did their best to thwart
our effort. Their keeper had an
excellent game, and cunningly
hid the ball inside his kicker
then fell into the goal -
unfortunately this does not
count, as Piglet pointed out. "We
woz robbed guv." was the general
opinion.
The second half started with
a whistle and ended with one too
[How unusual! - Ed.] but in-
between Son of Satan, inspired
by Captain Jazz's rousing talk,
converted a penalty to give us the
goal we thoroughly deserved. In
the dying seconds their U L U
player was sent off, ending a
jolly amicable game on slightly
hostile terms.

The atmosphere was electric, the
rain was torrential and the stick
tackles were rife! Yet our
victorious team came through to
win, a victory which should put
us at the top of the London
League.
iC Ladies lstvs Sunbury 0
One player down (due to the Half
Pint Kid's hangover and our key
left wing skiing in Colorado!)
things didn't look too good!
After conceding a goal in the first
half, we thought our days were
numbered but in true David Icke
style the skipper pulled one back
for us. "We are not worthy... we
are not worthy..." Final score was
one all to a team that has not lost
this season.

IC Ladies vs West Five
The spooky decor of Charlie
Chaplain's orphanage provided
the setting for the team's third
win of 1995. Whether is was
Charlie's ghost giving us a
blessing or whether it was the
rare performance of our inspiring
Barbara is debatable.
The game was close at first
with the score level at 2 - 2. Once
Elaine put down her friendship
bracelets, Carolyn turned her
knickers inside out and Claire
put on her shorts the right way
round, the team rallied. The
maltloaf and blackcurrant juice
provided the motive for the
subsequent massacre.
It was undoubtedly the best
performance of the season and
was sweet revenge from the
match earlier in the year.
Get well soon to Carolyn's
car. Best wishes to Paul's rash
and Elaine's friendship bracelets.
(And Carolyn, we won't tell
anyone about chatting up the taxi
driver!!)
Basically, we won 'cos we woz
better than them.
