After an
exhaustive lecture-
to-lab day, crossing
Prince Consort Road
and entering the
Quad through Beit
Arch on a cold and rainy
Monday evening cannot
be more rewarding than
the warmth of my room
in Richmond. Silence pre-
vails i n and around Beit
hall, the U n i o n office is
closed, there are a handful
of people in Da Vinci's. Yet
as one enters the U n i o n
building, the sweet voice
of a chorus can be
heard i n a dis-
tance... singing very confidently "Tomorrow
Belongs To M e " . " O h God, you're late for
rehearsal again", Conscience indicts me. But
as soon as I reach the Concert Hall, all wor-
ries die away as I am about to enjoy a three-
hour rehearsal to its full, while my voice is
joining the other low-voice men i n " O h
Fatherland..."
A l l those of you who have noticed the
posters around College know what "Cabaret",
"Le Cabaret" or "Das Kabarett" is. The
major Operatic Society production for this
year, scheduled for five performances from
the 31st of January till the 4th of February
inclusive.
Cabaret. The word itself i n everyday
usage usually conjures up pictures of seedy
strip joints on dimly lit streets, or night-clubs
where the exhorbitant price of drinks is
rarely linked to the meagre stage fare. T o
these images, the musical and the film
Cabaret have added a grim aura of Weimarian
decadence and a hint of satire. These versions
of Cabaret are distant relatives of the literary
Cabaret which emerged in France in the 19th
century and blossomed into a unique medi-
um for political and cultural satire i n Paris
and (later on) Berlin, Munich and elsewhere
in Germany. Common ground is the presence
of spectacle and an intimate space in which
people can smoke and talk, eat and drink.
Our team has been aiming to mix all flavours
in various ways and proportions, and thus to
F E L I X
produce something unique, and very enjoy-
able!
T h e action opens i n a Deutsche
Reichsbahn train from Paris to Berlin at the
beginning of the Thirties when Clifford
Bradshaw, a young American writer, meets
Ernst Ludwig, a pleasant man who surprises
Cliff by putting his briefcase among Cliffs
luggage when they reach the German border.
In return for Cliffs discretion Ernst gives
him an address in Berlin where he'll definite-
ly find a room, Fraulein Schneider's house.
Cliff begins teaching Ernst English and, on
the New Year's Eve they go to the K i t K a t
Club, where he meets Sally Bowls an English
girl working there as a dancer.
The KitKat Club is now the stage, where
the Master of Ceremonies along with the
KitKat Girls (who are neither respectable nor
wearing much!) take us through the story.
Cliff and Sally fall in love, and she moves into
Fraulein Schneider's house with him, where
they meet Herr Schultz, a Jewish fruitseller
courting F l . Schneider, Fraulein Kost, an
amiable mistress who specialises in sailors,
and other characters of a fairly sleazy period
in Berlin's history. Gradually Cliff begins to
see the black clouds of Nazism gathering, and
at the same time everyone else has a funny
feeling that something very bad is about to
happen...
I would tell you more but I have the feel-
ing that the tall, thin fellow with the black
cape and the scythe who is shadowing me is
not Death, but my Director!
Seriously though, Amanda is not such a
frightful person at all (believe me) and she
has been the driving force behind this pro-
duction, as has Jonathan, our M u s i c a l
Director. Our team of actors and dancers
have been working very intensively to pro-
duce a good show. The fact that we all had an
enormous amount of fun i n doing this
ensures that the show will be a success. Above
all I'd like to thank everybody involved for
some of the most brilliant evenings at College
this year. Guys and Girls, warm up for the
final rehearsals and the performances! As for
you, we'll be waiting to serve you at the
K i t K a t Club the nights of 31st of January,
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th of January...

The next films to be shown at I C U Cinema
will not be until February, due to the produc-
tion of Cabaret by Opsoc. Films to be shown
include: Pulp Fiction, The Nightmare Before
Christmas, The Exorcist and more. Stay
tuned to FELIX and our posters for informa-
tion on dates and times.
However bear in mind that you don't just
get to watch films with Filmsoc, you can get
involved too. Come along, help us out and
get to see the film for free. If you're interest-
ed, turn up an hour before a show and ask for
Michael. Other benefits do exist, since we do
get to see the occasional preview; a few of us
saw the new Star Trek film the other week.
It's a cracking film, but you will have to wait
till February to see it in the West End.
