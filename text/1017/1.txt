Election
Question
BY A N D R E W T S E N G
The first signs of an impending
ICU sabbatical elections fiasco
appeared this week after it was
found that vital equipment
would not be available.
I C U is hoping to have ten
ballot boxes located around the
South Kensington campus; from
previous years' voting, this
appears to have been the
optimum number of boxes.
However, College w i l l only
provide seven swipe card readers.
Last year, Andrew Wensley, then
I C U President, made arrange-
ments with college for the use of
seven readers. It was suggested
that I C U approach college at a
later date if any more were
required. But on further
investigation by Lucy Chothia,
I C U President, the three
machines required would take
another twelve weeks to arrive
and at a cost of £17,000 each.
With elections due to take place
in six weeks, the I C U executive
are frantically trying to arrive at
a workable solution.
Possibilities discussed at
this week's I C U Executive
Committee meeting include the
issuing of one-off voting passes
to all students, and the issuing of
ICU cards to all first and second
year students. But any procedure
which requires the sending out
of thousands of pieces of paper is

Exam Papers Lost
B Y A N D R E W T S E N G
F o u r t h year Aeronautical
Engineering students are taking
it easy this week after their exam
papers were lost. They will have
to take their exams at the end of
February instead, shortly before
they leave on industrial
placements.
The papers, due to be taken
during the first week of term,
were sent using the Royal Mail
shortly before Christmas.
However, they have still not
been received by the external
examiners, having apparently
been lost during the Christmas
festivities.
Under University of London
regulations the department had
no option but to cancel the
examinations, giving fourth year
students a brief respite from the
rigours of academic stress.
Fortunately for the Depart-
ment of Aeronautical E n g i n -
eering, the exams were to have
been taken after the Christmas
recess.
It is unclear as to what
would have happened if summer
papers were lost. Professor Peter
Bearman, Head of the Depart-
ment of Aeronautical E n g i n -
eering, commented: "I don't
know what you'd do then, jump
out of the window or
something."
