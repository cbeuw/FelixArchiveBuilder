Cat's Tale
Tea For One b y M i m i C h a k r a b o r t y
There are four waiters in the room
and precisely two tables are
occupied. I am at one, and to my
left on a raised dais on which the
grand piano stands, and reflected
by a large gilt mirror which fills the
wall behind them, are a retired
American couple, Bill and Barbara,
whose argument about their
daughter Rebecca currently holds
the room.
Between several pots of tea
and silver stacks bearing tiers of
bridge rolls, crumpets and cream
fancies - "they're so delicious",
"they're darn small" - some trifling
elements of their life history
emerge. Rebecca has abandoned
Wisconsin in favour of Chicago,
taking her two-year-old daughter
Nora but leaving her husband
Michael behind. The argument
appears to be an ongoing one, and
at any rate the fundamental thesis
- an acceptable degree of juvenile
freedom - is left unresolved.
In fact, Bill and Barbara and
a third person at the table, a
woman, would attract attention
even without their ongoing narr-
ative because they are, quite
strikingly, attired in the same white
and purple flash shell suits with
Reebok trainers. On the handles of
the one unoccupied chair hang two
matching travel bags, also in
exactly matching white purple, one
for Him, one for Her. On its seat
yet another has tipped over,
revealing its contents: a packet of
Handi-Wipes, a make-up bag and
some Evian facial spray.
Between them a trio of wait-
ers perform an elegant gavotte of
pouring, serving and replacing. The
device of afternoon tea is a com-
plex one requiring separate spoons,
forks, tongs and tea-strainers. The
silver pots have hot handles and
employ white linen napkins in
order to be lifted, likewise the
slightly smaller pots of water.
Part of what is striking about
this incidental theatre is that it
involves a quite serious effort of will
to be any one of the parties invol-
ved - in other words to ignore com-
pletely the presence of the others.
The waiters, one can imagine,
would execute the same series of
movements if they were serving an
empty table, while the diners must
behave as though the cups and
saucers are moving themselves. Of
the three at the table, only Bill
succeeds at the game; both his
female companions snag the
rhythm with anxious shifting and
murmured thank you's and attem-
pts to do things for themselves.
When the bill arrives,
enclosed in an embossed leather
wallet, Bill reaches for a brown
leather body pouch and hands a
credit card to the waiter without
looking at him. The waiter is young
but tall with dark hair and slender
hands. He helps Barbara with her
jacket, the zip of which has got
caught up in her hair.
As it happens, the particular
environment which yields this
pattern of manners is the Chinese
conservatory at the Lanesborough
Hotel, on the corner of Hyde Park
Corner and Park Lane. It is four-
thirty, it is a bank holiday, it is
raining. As the afternoon light slips
from blue to yellow to grey, fat
droplets slap against the conserv-
atory roof which looks up into an
internal courtyard. The enforced
humidity of the room and the
resulting condensation have prov-
ided fertile corners for mildew and
moss which, although cleaned
away on the inside, have taken
hold of the exterior, and which,
with a necklace of weeds, frame
the sky.
court of George IV the Prince
Regent, which is now the Brighton
Pavilion, a building whose curlicues
and Turkish verandas might also be
considered oxymoronic against the
local colour.
Until 1980, the Lanes-
borough was the site of the old St
George's hospital, and before that
it started life in 1719 as James
Lane's design for a town house for
the second Viscount Lanesborough.
The hotel has been open only four
years, but has the distinction - at
five thousand pounds per night - of
offering London's most expensive
suite (a single room for a single
night will put you out by one hun-
dred and fifty pounds, by the way).
It is possible to walk past the
building several times without
noticing it and several times more
without identifying it as a hotel;
there is no choice of a swing door
or a rotating one, there are no
steps leading upwards, no signs for
credit cards accepted or AA stars
accrued. It could be mistaken, in
sombre Belgravia cream, for an
embassy or a club or even a private

a t f i v e t h o u s a n d p o u n d s p e r n i g h t .
The conservatory has an
unusual, Oriental design, enhanced
by painted paper lanterns and
Chinese baskets which hang from
the sky. In fact it is quite possible to
imagine brightly coloured exotic
birds flapping and crowing in the
upper branches of the trees and
huge bowls of flowers which sit in
brass bowls across the room.
At eye level, however, the
carpet of white linen and sparkling
glassware prevails. The gliding
waiters and china cups and the
discreet twinkle of silver on glass let
slip an ambition for a very
particular European aristocratic
decadence, which is viscerally at
odds with William Wilkins' lush
Manchurian suggestion.
That this is not really a
problem, that a contradiction of
architecture and design is in no
way out of character with the
contradictions of the hotel itself, is
the unintentional message which
time spent in the conservatory
conveys. (As it happens Wilkins'
design was after the style of the
house, but what it resembles most
exactly is one of those anonymous
palladian mansions like the
Mansion House or the buildings
framing Admiralty Arch, whose
presence is tolerated by the tax-
payer, but whose function is never
fully explained.
Actually there is only one
doorway, small, and one doorman,
courteous. The marble hall is
narrow - more than two people
could not walk in comfort - and
passes an open fireplace, above
which a dark oil painting depicting
an English racing scene looks
across to the dining room which,
although partly closed off, reveals
that the dominant theme is Parisian
boudoir pink.
The accessible parts of the
hotel attempt to retain the style of a
large formal house. The bar is in
The Library, and has the Brooke's
Brothers style of an Ivy League
club. The books in the floor-to-
ceiling bookcases are, in a way
which might prove disappointing,
painted boxes in the style of first
editions. Scotch on the rocks arrives
on a silver tray with a plate of hors
d'oeuvres and minute linen napkin.
There are no public tele-
phones, no newspaper stand, and,
quite disablingly, no kiosk where
one might nip in to buy emergency
Tampax, Nurofen or condoms. In
fact there is no evidence that mon-
ey changes hands anywhere at all.
It strikes, finally, that the kind
of people who might find security
at the Lanesborough - as opposed
to its flashier Park Lane neighbours
- might be the kind of people
whose lives accept a degree of
pretended status, and who, in fact
,infer it as real. Who require, to oil
the wheels between meetings and
drivers and wives and airports, the
lubricant of one-on-one deference
from a sequence of attentive
inferiors. The kind of people who
might not, as it happens, spot the
error in placing an English racing
scene above a roaring fire opposite
a pink boudoir and looking down
on a red, green and gold rug
bearing a pattern of Oriental
dragons.
The design of the hotel,
though empirically haphazard, is
quite specific in its intention, and
on the evidence, quite successful.
Where it most succeeds is in
supporting a particular self-
deception, deriving from the belief
that rank and status are essentially
deserving, and it is the purveying of
this, finally, which is being paid for.
As it happens it is not true.
As it happens, to interpret the
conflicting messages of the
Lanesborough Hotel and therefore
to fully derive its pleasures, it is
necessary to be quite seriously
poor. It is necessary, on the
grounds of a quite appalling credit
rating, to have been denied any
one of the credit cards which the
hotel is happy to accept. It is
necessary to have been toying, over
a period of several hours, with a
single pot of tea, long gone cold.
And to have omitted, on the
grounds of an over-familiarity with
tea bags, to make use of the tea-
strainer (an action which results in
immediate confiscation by a waiter
of the cold cup with bits floating in
it, and the production of a fresh
one by another).
What results is a particular
type of understanding, and
consequently, of security, which
yields only out of having nowhere
really to go on a wet misery-soaked
day, in a sleep walking city with
problems one would rather forget,
and bills unpaid.
