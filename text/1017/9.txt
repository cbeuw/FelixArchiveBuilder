Clued Up
R a n t a n d R o l l
A friend of mine graduated
last year and got a really nice letter
from NatWest asking about his
future banking arrangements. My
future banking arrangements, he
wrote back,
are with
Abbey Nat-
ional. Do as he does: dump
NatWest when you can afford to.
Talking of NaiWest, does
anyone remember our erstwhile
President, Lucy Chothia, pledging to
do something about bank charges
that the Union pays. Has anything
been done about it? Has anything
been done about anything that Ms
Chothia talked about? Anyone
remember the College Second-hand
bookshop? Then there was the one
about protecting Harlingon from
encroachments by Heathrow. What
was Ms Chothia planning to do, I
wonder? Buy a token share in BAA
pic and disrupt their AGM? Or
perhaps -
more in the
spirit of
New Age protests - tie herself to a
tree at Heathrow? Or perhaps
something more accommodating:
the boys and girls can play hockey
on the runway in-between jumbo
landings?
I was planning to write a
column called SabWatch, in which I
would report on the achievements
of the Sabbaticals. But sadly that's
another project that must be
shelved due to lack of material.
NatWest really piss me off. (No,
this is not another piece about the
evils of capitalism - Hobsbawm
was the last of the Marxists and
we're all Thatcher's children now.)
The cash machine usually has 20
people permanently camped in
front of it. The cash dispensers
inside the Imperial branch are only
open during lecture hours - and
anyway you can't use your Midland
card in them. As for queuing up, I
don't really have 1/2 hour to be
bored. Why is it that a service
cannot be provided properly? I
suppose we should all be grateful
that there is that one cash machine
for all 7000 of the students at
Imperial. And that we are allowed
to take out overdrafts.

You meet the strangest people on
the tube. Exhibit A: 'Mad' Angus,
all vacant-lot eyes and mutant
clumps of dirty bristles which might,
in a bad light, pass for a beard (all
mad holy men have beards; it's a
ancient law or charter, probably).
Angus has no fixed abode - unless
you count the Circle line - and
spends his time giving impromptu
sermons to rush-hour commuters.
He talks at length about living your
life according to the Word of God,
loving your fellow man and helping
those less fortunate than yourself -
such as giving an old man.money
to buy food. This appeal to his

fellow travellers' charitable instincts
invariably falls on deaf ears. He'll
give a faded smile to no one in
particular, and proceed to bless the
carriage and its inhabitants using a
small crucifix and a series of
apparently random hand
movements, like a badly drawn
flip-book man. People suddenly
become very interested in
Oranjeboom adverts, newspapers,
or their shoelaces. Eventually
Angus goes away to convert the
heathens of the Northern line, and
people exchange little wry glances
as if to say: 'what a nutter, eh?'.
Now you're probably
expecting a 'Hey people, let's care
a bit more about the homeless,
OK?' moral about now: Angus may
be slightly woofing, but he still
deserves to be treated as human,
right? Wrong. That kind of bleeding
heart riff would be just too
hypocritical. So what if he's
homeless and looks like an extra
from Night of the Living Dead,
doesn't he know the rest of us have
problems? 'Sides, he didn't even
know any of the good bits from
Revelations, which is the very least I
expect from reality-challenged
scroungers before giving handouts.
No, I'm more interested in
what passes for sanity these days.
Take a look at Exhibit B the next
time you're on the tube: they jump
on like lemmings every morning,
stand crushed against someone's
armpit for half-an-hour or more,
and never once look someone else
in the eye. 9 'til 5 in a job they hate
(or, worse, have no emotional
response to whatsoever) and then
back on the merry-go-nowhere of
stale breath and stale minds.
What is happening in the
Sherfield building? Does anyone
have any idea? All that plushness on
Level 5 and now this repainting and
remodelling of the entrance.
Perhaps this is in preparation for the
Union move? No, somehow - call
me cynical but - I doubt it. Why is
this completely unnecessary work
done? To boost the UK employment
figures? More likely to show a
better face to visitors. Not just any
old visitors, of course; visitors to
Sherfield, important visitors (you
know, like the £60k facelift to
Huxley's front when Mrs Anne
Lawrence came to write her very
own " 7 0 print hello : 20 goto 10"
program on the Fujitsu machine).

Repeat until dead, or a retirement
cottage in Milton Keynes. And they
think Angus is the mad one? Yeah,
I know every society has its social
norms, but do they really have to
be so...normal? In the follow up to
'Zen & The Art of MotorCycle
Maintenance'*, Robert Pursig
suggests that societies need 'mad'
people because their perspective
might be useful during times of
social upheaval. If there's even an
outside chance of him being right
then you owe it your country to flip
out in some interesting and
colourful manner. After all, a new
theory of social dynamics may
emerge from the crayon scribbles
on your padded wall...
