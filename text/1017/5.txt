Where's the student spirit gone?... Get Gaysoc off the Blocks.
Moving the
Thin End
Dear Owain,
Yet again it seems that the great
cogs of decision making in our
college have sprung into motion,
descending upon us their decree:
thou shall vacate Beit Quad!
Following Michael Ludlam's article
in FELIX last week the Union move
to the Sherfield building (or there
abouts) now seems imminent to
me.
This left me wondering this: has
anybody stopped to think for a
moment what is really going on?
One minute uncle Ron is discussing
axing RSM the next he's juggling
ICU into the bowels of Imperial
College's most architecturally
displeasing pile of rubble! What
next? Turn the Queen's tower into
a beacon to guide planes down to
Heathrow? The Union move not
only exemplifies the general trend
in this College for increased
centralised control, but also bodes
of an ill future for the students. A
future which may well be devoid of
any student control over the
services we pay for, such as the
Union entertainments and Sports
Centre facilities (The Union lent the
College over half a million pounds
- at a non-existent interest rate -
with which to renovate!) It would
be an easy step for the College to
take full control of the Union's
services and eventually disband it
entirely. Gone are the days of the
rebellious student spirit, I grant you
that. But Beit Quad is more than
just a symbol for the
student/college separation - it
defines the autonomy we are
entitled to and stands as the last
bastion of student independence.
Dan Look (Deputy President
Finance) told FELIX that a
referendum is possible. I say he
owes it to the student body to
decide such matters, although I
hope it never has to come to that.

Well, the removal of the post of
College Managing Director and the
new Deputy Rector may hint at a
brighter future. Unfortunately, I
doubt most of us will be around to
hear what time has to tell, so slow is
change at an institution like IC...
Gaysoc
Dear Owain,
Several recent letters, including
Lucy Chothia's last week and mine
last term, have been pessimistic
about homophobia at IC.
To balance the record, I should
point out that the College hosted
the annual conference of the
Terence Higgins Trust (the major
AIDS charity in Britain) in 1987,
and the International Lesbian and
Gay Youth Organisation held its
meeting in our Students' Union in
the same year.
There is a popular story that the
last IC gaysoc was 'sorted out' by
the rugger club.
Strangely, every time I've heard
it since I came here in 1986, this
always seems to have happened
'about four years ago', in particular
not within the memory of the
narrator!
The college's equal
opportunities statement does
mention sexual orientation, but it is
Edited this week by Owain Bennallack
piece of draghtsmanship which
belongs in 'Animal Farm'.
Once upon a time there was a
first year electronics student who,
within two weeks of his coming out,
not only completely changed his
hairstyle and manner of dress, but
also started running the ULU gay
group, and got himself appointed
IC gay students' welfare officer!
Unfortunately, by the second term,
IC, electronics and ULU were all
beneath his dignity, so he dropped
out and went to Goldsmith's to
study drama.
The moral of this is that the
College is what you make of it.
Lucy has generously offered to co-
ordinate efforts, so why not take
her up on it and get a new IC
GaySoc running? Meanwhile, the
ULU group meets every Thursday
evening and will welcome you
support.
