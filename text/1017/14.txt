This was most forcefully highlighted
with Jordan's decision to cast Tom Cruise in

of Daniel Day Lewis. He's as much Lestat as

Whilst this view was coloured
ather florid language she used,
siders viewed it as a typical actions from an
| eccentric woman. As Neil Jordan said, "I'm
sure the studio would have done anything to
get her to do that but there's nothing you can
do to change that woman's mind, believe me I
know. If she had seen the movie and hated it
you would have known about it. You'd still be
hearing about it now".
In retrospect then, it would seem that
ice's attitude to the making of her film
erely highlights the issues that authors who
re about their work face in allowing it to be
apted for the cinema. I guess that most just
ke the money and run. Locked outside of
e cinematic process Anna Rice took the
nly option that was open to her and that was
o use the media. For her at least, the result
eemed to be satisfactory and a sequel is
already planned and has been written. At the
\end of the day perhaps the most contradictory
sition is that of Neil Jordan.
W h e n he asked about the book at
tious points throughout the press
Merence, he was balanced in his praise,
rases like "I did enjoy the book when I
id it, I mean I thought I was overwritten"
re interspersed w i t h "it's the most
humourless book ever written" and "I think
the book does get a little bit turgid in its
obsession about certain things" when asked
£ book's homo-erotic element.
me brave soul asked; "I don't
wish to buJfsh*t you but you're just said in
the courseJof the last 20 minutes that this was
a turgidvwver written and humourless book.
W h y » r n ' t you go and create something
1 yourselves?"
For all the quickness and passion of
Jordan's reply, " I said that I loved the book ...
otherwise I wouldn't have done the bloody
movie, don't quote things that T half said"
there seemed to be some sort of truth in the
question. Q
