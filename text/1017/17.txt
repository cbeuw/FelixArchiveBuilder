Standby
throwing muses
ending in your dreams
The main problem for the
throwing muses' new album,
university is that it's not what most
people want to hear. After the
departures and soloing sabbaticals
of the last eighteen months, the
crowds are split into the Belly and
Kristin Hersh camps. Numerically
the Belly camp are much larger,
but if the Hersh camp attacked it
would probably win, thanks to its
age and sexual advantages. What
is more interesting is that both
'star' and 'hips and makers' sold
more copies than any of the
Throwing Muses albums did when
both Tanya Donnelly and Kristin
Hersh played the same drum.
So what can Kristin now offer
her new fan base? Well the
Throwing Muses are more than just
Kristin with a bassist and drummer.
Bernard Georges and David
Narcizo are certainly not pretty
faces but they flesh out the sound
that dominates the heartland of
the album. The lyrical tautness
maybe characteristic Hersh but
here that's less than half the story.
Personally I find myself at
odds with too many single
selections and the opening 'bright
yellow sun' is no exception in this
case. It's laboured in tone and the
choice of imagery, guns and
poison, seems to be too obviously
linked to hang on the Hersh's
schizoid hook. But after this
miscreant, you're find little to
regret in the next eleven tracks.
'Start' crashes in with a
reprise most writers would pay for.
"I'll start at his knees and I'll end
in his dreams" could be about
almost anything but if it's
seduction you're after, I don't think
it will fail you. And as single word
affirmations such as 'shimmer' and
'hazing' intersperse with delicate
vignettes like 'calm down, calm
down', it becomes easy to get
swept away.
The most obviously Kristian
tracks are the twin peaks of
'crabtown' and 'that's all you
wanted'. Where 'crabtown' lazes
into the distant poignancy that was
so earnestly displayed on 'hips and
makers', 'that's all you wanted'
raises angelic wings whilst
covering its ambiguous meaning.
Yet these two apart, the
consistency of 'university' is
underpinned by the presence of a
band. The downwards rhythm
progression of 'hazing' is perhaps
the singular example but you get
the impression that the slow
swagger of 'teller' and force of 'no
way in hell' will give an equally
good return with persistent listen-
ing as the more accessible tracks.
Perhaps the overall moral to
accept is don't live in the past. The
Throwing Muses are dead. Long
live the Throwing Muses. (8)
Kim Gordon is about to take
the stage and I'm squashed
between a forest of very tall guys
and four hundred people who
came just to see her. Because Kim
Gordon is such a symbol to me: of
womanhood, of age in the youth
business, of selling rather than
selling out, I'm terrified that she'll
be somehow wrong. Too fat or too
boring or too young or even too
ugly. All very incorrect of me, all
very true. But she's wonderful.
Handsome at 40, impossible thin
snakelidded eyes, dressed in her
'x-girl' brand (pink skirt and black
fishnet stockings) and purring into
the microphone with regal
certainty. She's the 'super' in this
supergroup, although the others
play their part. Julia from Pussy
Galore provides frenetic polemics,
Marc from Pavement a loose bass
and the drummer girl from The
Boredoms also plays a silver horn.
The music is conceptual and free-
form: I wouldn't listen to it at
home, as they say, but here it
makes perfect sense. The mosh
gets quite violent as does the
stage. After a poem castigating
several hostile NME hacks, Julia
later accepted the challenge of
creating a song about ugly men (a
suggestion from the floor). After
citing William Burroughs and
Everett True as good examples,
Julia stares out Kim. "No!" cries
Kim in mock horror, "Thurston's
cute!". We all laugh at this little in
joke, but then all pop music is
codified isn't it?
Free kitten attempt to crack
the code with their bit-on-the-side
project and succeed, partially. The
music is new, more then a
combination of the disparate
group members. But the reason
we're ail here is the same. Very
Important Indie.
What do Cheap Trick, Syd
Barrett, a brilliant title track and a
crud band name have in common?
Living room scene, the new album
by diilon fence, that's what. For
four minutes they breeze their
Carolina way through an
invigorating piece of loud but very
melodic guitar rock leaving you
with the pleasant premonition that
you're going to see two superb
bands when they support the Black
Crowes at the Royal Albert Hall.
Oh, and it sounds like Cheap Trick
(with a soupcon of the Faces
thrown in).
And then, no more. 'Laughs'
is an instant contradiction - a
lackadaisical guitar jangle and
sweet harmonies providing the
background before the insertion of
a moody, crescendo-ing guitar
solo. It's still refreshing though and
leads into the very Gigolo Aunts-y
(and hence Cheap Trick-y again)
'queen of the in-between'.
Elsewhere, the Syd Barrett
connection is consolidated (think:
Gigolo Aunts) via the lilting, early
Floydian psychedelia of 'high
school sap', and that previous
premonition begins to blossom.
Alas, it never actually
manages to bear fruit because for
the last third or so they decide to
go lilting a tad too much and end
up wilting instead. Not that we
should end on a negative note. Try
"a rather good" band instead of a
"superb" one and go to see them
anyway... (7) 0
Fluffy bras on the Word are where
it's at. Or so it seems as people
from all walks of life have been
overheard saying "fluffy under-
wear!" in varying tones of shock
and derision. The best (the only?)
in High St fluffy couture is at Ad-
Hoc, where bras are £38 and the
theme is extended to dresses
(snakeskin, patent, plastic, rubber
and leopard) at an equally
lengthened price. If the student
loan is looking drained, I say style
requires that you grab a Evostick
and slaughter your teddies.
Underwear does seem to be
the thing d la moment. Post-war
slim line dressing in smooth fitting
material mixes raises the question
of the Dreaded VLP (visible pantie
line). Whole shelf units in M&S and
pages in fashion mags are being
dedicated to the ultimate desire
icon - the G-string. Or, as skirts
lengthen (to the knee) and tighten,
the obvious new alternative is to
go without...
Catwalks this season
suggested the renewal of an age
old concept to ensure a smoother
overall line, whip out your
grandma's long line girdles. For
the 90's twist, add a transparent
dress, stilettoes and little else.
Lovely. What this has done,
however is to potentially
rejuvenate hotpants. The smaller
and shinier the better, displayed
under the new minis with waist-
high front slits (and no thighs!).
The post-war influence is
massive this spring. Red lips,
cropped pastel twin sets with
elbow length sleeves, sleeveless
shifts and cardigans - tight around
the neck or dropped into a V.
Cigarette pant trouser suits and
skinny patent belts emphasise the
waist and legs, while rich
cashmere mixes are on their way
to supply the glamour. Rustic and
neutrals are at last passe
(hurrah!!), and replaced with
pastel plastics. Palest lilac, pretty
pinks and luminous transparency
are set fair as the ways ahead. ©
