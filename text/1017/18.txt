Judging from this latest rendition of
the Dracula myth, vampires are
keen on theatricals. Avoid dark
streets on the way home from
i n t e r v i e w with the v a m p i r e ,
because your vampire film-goer will
be a cross vampire.
It's 1791, and Brad Pitt is Louis,
the disconsolate owner of a New
Orleans plantation. He's lost his
wife in childbirth, and has little to
live for when an extrovert but lonely
vampire offers him eternal youth.
So Louis becomes a reluctant
vampire in the graveyard where his
wife is buried. Vampire vision shows
him the statue on her grave slowly
opening its eyes, but the film never
makes anything of this aspect of
Anne Rice's novel.
The two hungrily cruise New
Orleans' bars by night. Tom Cruise,
excellent as Lestat, concentrates on
juicy women, with gorgeous young
men for seconds, but for a long
time Brad's conscience allows him
only rats, chickens and poodles.
Their relationship's less father-son
and more camp, except that Brad
Pitt's rather dreary. He pines. To
cheer him up, Lestat makes a
vampire out of Claudia, a tattered
orphan of the plague slums. Brad
has torched his mansion in a fit of
the blues - and the first of many
glorious fires in the film - but they
apparently have sufficient funds for
Claudia's education (and boy does
she run through piano teachers).
Initially she's a vile lisping brat, but
you warm to her because she gets
all the best gags. Anyhow, Lestat
runs the household, but gets rather
overbearing, and positively unsym-
pathetic when Claudia realises
she'll never grow up. (All vampires
have long hair, apparently, and I
thought this a good gap in the
market for a specialist hairdresser
F E L I X
until Claudia's ringlets sprung right
back the moment she cut them off.)
Claudia masterminds an
escape by tempting Lestat with
blood from dead meat, an absolute
no-no for vampires. She and Brad
tip his body into a swamp and whisk
off to Paris in time for the next
century. This is an opportunity for
lots of Les Liaisons Dangereuses
outfits and the 'French Accent
Department', as Claudia has a
fabulous time socialising and Louis
searches high society for European
vampires. However, when they turn
up, they're a bit too naughty for
Brad, the vampire with a human
soul. In fact, Brad's rather drippy,
and we never see him eat in public
again. In the book, Louis has an
affair with Armand, a cultured
Parisian vampire; in the film they
meet a couple of times before Brad
mopes off to the rest of Europe on
his own, upset with all that old
world decadence.
Back in the twentieth century,
Brad returns to America. He follows
a faint sniff of vampire, which turns
out to be Lestat, alive after all, but a
bit shaky. Leaving Lestat hiding out,
Brad decamps to San Francisco and
tells his story to journalist Christian
Slater. Slater's excited by the scoop
(suspense-lovers stop here), jumps
into his car, and guess what?
The scenery's lush throughout,
but the film jumps from rioting
slaves to sucking prostitutes' blood
to doll shops to vampire gang-rapes
to parent-child scenes, which rather
wastes the audience's feelings.
Louis' first rat-eating attempts are
fun, like the Claudia scenes,
making the film agreeable, if jerky.
It's certainly a blockbuster - from
Neil Jordan, director of 'Crying
G a m e ' (arthouse turned big
success) - but would probably have
been better if Anne Rice hadn't
written the script. Authors never
have the guts to edit firmly. Tom
Cruise is almost unrecognisable and
superb as an antidote to Louis'
dreary narrative; a more interesting
actor than Brad Pitt might have had
trouble with stodgy Louis. Neither
Cruise nor Pitt are likely to
antagonise female fans with the
supposed homoerotica: it's hardly
developed and easy to miss in all
the scene-shifting. As for the film
being a lament for the days when
you could suck all the blood you
wanted without getting AIDS, give
me a break.
In shallow grave, Alex, Juliet
and David are looking for a
flatmate. However, shortly after he
has moved in, they find him in bed
dead, naked, and in possession of a
suitcase containing a large amount
of money. They decide to keep the
money and conceal the body by
dismembering and disfiguring it
before burying it in a "shallow
grave".
The film begins with an
amusing scene in which the three
main characters are interviewing
prospective flatmates. However,
after the discovery of the dead
body, the film suddenly becomes
very bleak; the proposal and
execution of the plan to mutilate
and bury the body leaves the
audience feeling uncomfortable (at
times, the audience may feel that
they are laughing in the wrong
places)
Without 'big name' actors and
because of its storyline, Shallow
Grave undoubtedly lacks the
commercial appeal of some of its
American competitors currently on
release. Nevertheless, it's a well-
made film which is extremely well
acted. 0

Polish food is not just potatoes. In
fact very few potatoes appear on
the menu at Ognisko Polskie in
South Kensington. Instead you are
presented with an enticing but
expensive insight into the delights
of Polish food.
The setting is stunning, fit for
any Polish aristocrat who happens
to walk by. The pink and gold
dining room with windows onto
the lawn outside sets off the
beautifully presented and served
menu.
The pickled herrings with sour
cream, sweet onion and black
bread (£2.50) provide a
staggering start to the meal. The
herrings are soft, salty and
succulent, making the English roll
mop look like a peasant in
comparison.
For main course the choice of
traditional Polish fare is infiltrated
by an occasional continental dish.
However, the roast goose served
with red cabbage and potato
dumpling (£11.50) was unques-
tionably Eastern European. Its
combination of flavour, texture
and colour went straight to the
gastronomic G-spot. This was
exciting food, perfectly cooked and
presented in large, attractive
potions.
Leaning towards the
continental side of the menu, the
beef with potato roast and
caramelized shallots (£11.50) was
simple cooking, elevated to
exceptional heights. The beef was
beautifully pink in the middle and
extremely light on the jaw. The
potato roast was disappointingly
soggy but still highly enjoyable
and the shallots added a sweet
edge to the meal.
For dessert the cheesecake is
possibly the best in London. This is
a traditional cheesecake, baked in
the oven and served in a satisfying
wedge big enough for two. Its
texture was scrumptious: light but
creamy with a sweet, cheesy, melt
in the mouth taste. With sultanas
dotted throughout and a crunchy
chocolate coating, this provided
the perfect end to an almost
perfect meal.
To fault the food at Ogniska's
is extremely difficult. The prices
reflect the skill, time and effort
that go into each dish. It is an
absolute pleasure to eat here, so if
you want a treat, go along and for
a couple of hours you can be that
Polish aristocrat. ©
