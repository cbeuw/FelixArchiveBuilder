Imperial College Top Funded
B Y A N D R E W L O N G
Imperial students have the most
funding, according to a report in
last week's T i m e s H i g h e r
Education Supplement. I C ,
receives £404 per student above
the average level of support, £71
more per student than 2nd
placed Oxford and a massive
£998 more per student than
Luton.
The H i g h e r E d u c a t i o n
Funding Council for England
(HEFCE), regulates the funding
by assessing each university in
15 subject groups. Following the
publication of their latest
assessment, H E F C E have come
under fire for using a seemingly
unfair system. Critics say that it
is difficult to gauge the real size
of the discrepancies, as
universities teaching pred-
ominantly science and tech-
nology courses are clearly going
to receive more funding than
those w h i c h centre on the
humanities.
Nonetheless, there is a
remarkable variation i n
financing levels within specific
subjects. W h i l e each of our
engineers rake i n a most
welcome £2738, Bournemouth
engineers are allocated just
£1362 per student.
The figures are drawing
considerable censure from the
universities which appear at the
bottom of the table. H E F C E is
apparently attempting to narrow
the range of funding by applying
harsher efficiency criteria to the
more generously funded
universities, but it will be 15-20
years before the current range
drops to w i t h i n 5% of the
average. C o m m e n t i n g on the
situation, Peter Knight, Vice -
Chancellor of the University of
Central England, described the
strategy as, 'one of HEFCE's less
dynamic policies'.
Speculation within IC is that
impoverished Imperial students
will be considerably consoled,
knowing that the college receives
such great sums of cash on their
behalf.

A Willful Week
It has been one of those weeks
that weekends were designed for.
On Monday I decided to increase
the number of pages to twenty
four which was possibly over-
stretching our second week of
term capabilities. (Careful
inspection of the newspaper
before you will reveal that any
page increase must occur i n
increments of four). It's a F E L I X
editor's worst dilemma - jump or
cut? Being a brave lad I jumped.
Thanks fate. This week news
was largely elsewhere and if sport
happened we didn't hear about it.
A n article was cut at the last
minute and the white space piled
up. To top it all, the collator (the
machine that folds and staples) is
broken and the supposedly
couriered part replacement that
our skilled technicians (ie. a
postgrad with a talent for taking
things apart, and an optimistic
view towards his re-assembly
abilities) eagerly await is yet to
arrive.
If this issue reaches you
without staples I fear there has
been a motorway collision of
some sort.
I know no-one likes a
moaner but it's been a good few
weeks since I last whinged so
poor me, poor me, boo-hoo-hoo.
Plee for more people
Following on from my tantrum
above, I'd like to extend the
warm hand of friendship to
anyone who has any ideas they
would like to implement i n
F E L I X . D o you have an
unbeatable column concept or a
series of features you'd like to
write? Perhaps you're a
photographer or an illustrator
who would like to see his work in
print? Y o u ' l l find I have an
enthusiastic ear towards all
suggestions - and have a few
ideas I'd like to see achieved if
anyone feels they'd like to write.
Come in and make a change.
Owain's Curse
I think I may have a gift for
bringing out the worst in people.
Consider my flatmates. A l l
extremely able and intelligent
people. A l l completely clueless as
to what they will be doing next
year.
The first to suffer was ' P D ' .
P D had a promising career in
front of him as a capitalist and
materialist: the future looked
bright. Foolishly in a moment of
weakness I read him 'Aubade' by
P h i l i p L a r k e n - a mature
adolescent's poem about death
and pointlessness. "It's all
pointless," cries P D . "I don't
want a high powered job - I just
want a job as a cinema
attendant."
I met JJ last year i n this
office. As well as taking my own
life down a dubious course, my
sabbatical has allowed this young
firebrand (with a Masters and
holder of a first class degree in
aeronautics) to charge around all
day producing work for spurious
publications and listening to the
'witless jabberings of indie-
music' (Alexander, 1994).
Maybe it's the hair. M A
should at least have been
immune. This high flyer had his
sights set on the horizons where
my sun sets. Surely he'd be
immune to the Mcjob syndrome?
(Mcjob - Menial, low wage, low
prospects employment). Appa-
rently not. He's decided M I T is
not for him and has considering
starting a business with me at the
end of the year.
A Mcjob i f ever there was
one.
The Veal Deal
So people are sitting down i n
front of lorries to save veal calves
are they? Does anyone else find it
disturbing the lengths the British
public will go to to be the most
hypocritical nation on Earth? A
French politician apparently
smirked with a sigh of 'Ah, those
British', when told of our sudden
horror at the treatment of the
calves. I have nothing against
campaigning for animal rights
but couldn't the campaigns
become a little less erratic? A t
least the continentals seem to
have some consistency in their
treatment of animals.
It is well known that Hitler
was a vegetarian: I wonder
whether the Germans and
Scandinavians also consider
themselves to be the kindest
nation to animals. There is an old
theory in art that the English
Romantics painted landscapes
because they sympathised with
nature whereas to the south, the
Romantic latin artists of Spain,
France and Italy avoided
landscapes to paint human
figures. It was at best useful for
stopping their human subjects
from dropping off the canvas.
Does the same hold for
animals - are they just props and
chops those countries?
