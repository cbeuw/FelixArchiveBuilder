Fascism Crackdown
B Y R A C H E L W A L T E R S
In an attempt to combat
incidents of fascism on
university campuses, the
National Union of Students has
set up a 24 hour phoneline,
'Campuswatch'.
The hot-line gives a
recorded message i n v i t i n g
students to report graffiti,
offensive leafleting and attacks.
Callers are asked to give details
of the location and nature of the
incident, along with details of
their student union so that the
complaint can be followed up.
The N U S say that they have had

Imperial College U n i o n (ICU)
Council has voted its members to
write to their MPs highlighting
student difficulties. T h e call
comes two weeks before the
House of Commons is to debate
student hardship.
L u c y Chothia, I C U
President, was approached by the
President of the E d i n b u r g h
University Students' Union, on
behalf of the Ancients
Campaign, asking students to
write to MPs, before the issue is
debated in the Commons.

sities established before 1960.

likely to be difficult. " T h e
logistics are a nightmare,"
commented Dan Look, Deputy
President (Finance & Services).
"The only sensible option seems
to me to use the swipe card
system as efficiently as possible."
However, the decision will be
made by the elections comm-
ittee, a subcommittee of I C U
C o u n c i l who have full res-
ponsibility over the forthcoming
3-5 callers a day to the new line.
Speaking to F E L I X , L i z
Lanka from the N U S explained
how the service works: " I f a
student calls up to report an
incident of fascism, such as
offensive graffiti, we can give
advice on how to get rid of it and
give information on how to
change policy in their student
unions so that all graffiti is
removed as soon as possible."
Ms Lanka said that whilst
they hoped to be able to offer
helpful counselling and advice,
the service was p r i m a r i l y
designed as a monitoring service.
As part of the continuing N U S
T h o u g h only part of the
U n i v e r s i t y of L o n d o n , the
Ancients Campaign has found
that they got a better response
when going straight to Colleges
instead of through the
University of London Union.
Presenting the motion to
I C U Council last Tuesday, Ms
Chothia suggested that Council
members also bring the rising
prices of the L o n d o n
Underground to the attention of
M P s . She hoped that L o n d o n
Underground might consider
offering student discounts on
monthly or weekly travelcards.
However, Council thought that
discussing the L o n d o n
Underground would take
attention away from other
elections.
The problems stem from the
merging of the I C U card and
college security pass. Introduced
by Rick Bilby, Deputy President
from 1992-1993, the move was
seen as a way to reduce the
administrative burden on I C U
staff, although some cynics saw it
as a way to safeguard ICU in the
run up to Government reforms
of student unions. The result has
been that all students arriving at
Imperial from October 1993 have

accumulated information will be
used to draw attention to the
scale of the problem on campuses
throughout the country.
Emphasising that the service
did not exist to put pressure on
student unions, she said that
they hoped to provide an
environment where students
could air problems i n
confidence.
Although Imperial is not an
affiliated member of the N U S ,
they have said that calls would
be welcomed from students at
IC. The number to call is (0426)

the first since the Governing
Body passed most of the new
constitution, brings to an end
one and half years of
constitutional change i n I C U .
The 'Mary's Amendment' was
passed by an overwhelming
majority. Claire M o l o n e y ,
speaking at Council, said: "We
saw the amendment before it
went to the Governing Body and
were happy with it." Council,

similar to the I C U Council that
existed two years ago, replaces

Student
Fraud
B Y R A C H E L W A L T E R S
Universities nationwide have
been asked to increase checks on
students as reports of grant fraud
on a 'massive' scale have
emerged.
T h e Universities and
Colleges A d m i s s i o n s Service
(UCAS) has identified 700 fake
applications in the past year as
fraudsters attempted to obtain
the necessary paperwork to get
grants and student loans. These
could have netted £1.5 million in
grants alone, and UCAS believes
that there may be thousands
more illegal applications going
undetected.
Describing the fraud as 'big
business', Tony Higgins, Chief
Executive of U C A S , said: ' A n
i n d i v i d u a l w i l l register at
perhaps half a dozen universities
on the same day and then collect
the grant. They have computer
equipment producing high
quality examination and birth
certificates.' He also pointed out
that universities themselves
stood to gain from the fraud, as
they would end up receiving
tuition fees for students that did
not attend.
The problem is known to
have originated in London, but
it is not clear whether Imperial
has been subject to any
fabricated applications.
In a separate development,
the beleaguered Student Loans
Company (SLC) has come in for
further attack. Already under
official investigation for
malpractice, the remit of the
inquiry has been extended to
include allegations of corruption.
Ron Harrison, the former chief
executive recently replaced by
ex-Imperial rector Sir Eric Ash,
is thought to have come in for
personal c r i t i c i s m . Last year
claims emerged that he had
spent £600 on whisky for the
boardroom. However, company
officials have insisted that the
bills were part of legitimate
corporate entertainment.
