Are you hard up?
The Ancient Universities (those founded before 1865) are writing
to their M.P.'s explaining that students who study at these
Universities are being hit by student poverty. There is a
Government Debate on student Hardship on the 30th January.
Council is asking you to join students from Oxford, Cambridge,
St. Andrews etc. by writing to you M.P. and telling them how
hard up you are. Ask him/her to support the students on
Monday 30th January. When the M.P.'s were at college they
had a full grant, access to housing benefit and income support
during the vacation. Please write and ask for their support. If you
don't know who your M.P. is ask at the Union Office they have a
list of each M.P. and their constituency.
