The words we write descend from the
words we spoke. Novels arrived via
biography to provide us with the most
incisive form of self-contemplation the
human race has yet discovered. In the
course of time words have assumed a
pre-eminent place in society as the
repository of'truth': in the courts, the
school room and the paperback. But
writers such as J a m e s J o y c e , G e r t r u d e S t e i n
and ® J a q u . e s D e m d a have seen through
the veneer of authority carried by the
literary cannon and attempted to find
new ways of writing. In addition
t Q p o s t ' m o d e r n theory has undermined
the traditional view of the author-reader
relationship. Books are on the run.
The D e c o n s t m c t i o n i s t accepts that only
by reading a book is the book completed.
The reader brings to the work his own
personal lexicon: his own ways of
understanding words, his own history,
in short his own set of life experiences.
However skillful the author, he is always
writing in a shared and confused
language and must always rely on his
reader to interpret the work as best he
can. For this reason it has
been proclaimed that the
author is dead. More
realistically, the author is
neatly demystified.
Hypertext is a paradigm for writing
that explicitly makes use of the human
presence of the reader. Like the ancient
oral tradition, the reader is able to probe
his storyteller by the use of link words
(currently selected using a mouse and
embedded into the text as a different
colour or font). The author may write
separate threads of narrative to be used
in different situations - rather like the
F i g h t i n g F a n t a s y novels of your childhood.
Thus, different people may read the
same book but reach different dest-
inations. The computer, using hypertext,
allows the author to escape the tyranny
of chronological order and relate events
or 'happenings' in a more digressive
way, allowing the reader to move
through the landscape of text in his own
fashion. Only via this 'dynamic text' will
writing assume its next, post-post-
modern incarnation.
Silicon Semantics
Whilst the French have been deconstructing
J the Q Semantics of language, the rest of
the world has been building computers.
And whilst literary theory may justify the shift of power to
the Power-Hlac, the truth is that it would probably have
happened anyway. Survival of the fittest.
Computers have been used as text engines for
decades already, in the shape of Word Processors. Word
Processors derive their power from their ability to keep text
'alive' by translating it through various functions into hard
store. Whereas writing words on a page results in
permanance that only replacement can overcome,
computerised text is open like any other form of data to
well defined functions. The most obvious of these are spell
checkers and the mere ability to re-edit text. More powerful
programs, such as the QuarhExpress package I'm using
| now, allow great control over the finished appearance of
the word! Finished - does it have to stop here?
Obviously not. Hypertext is a term first coined in the
60's by ® T e d l l e l s o n . By retaining the words in the machine,
hypertext is able to support cross reference linking to other
'nodes' of text. i.e. It is reactive, it is dynamic. The
possibilities open to authors are enormous and range from
multiple plots and multiple characters to whole new writing
styles. But the real authors of change are the computer
programmers who bring hypertext bundled with the
Macintosh and the h t m l hypertext system which is helping
to fuel the internet explosion. If you stand around waiting
for the next chapter to be written, you'll probably find
everyone else has cut to the chase...
