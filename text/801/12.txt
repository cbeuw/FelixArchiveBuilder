Making Mr Right (15)
Despite the title, this film is not a
'despondent-woman-creates-her-
ideal-man' role reversal of the
hilarious Weird Science—although
rumour has it that it started out that
way. Somewhere along the line a
lovable android appeared—and the
rest, as they say, is film.
Frankie (Ann Magnuson) is a high-
paid, high-powered PR consultant in
a 50s feeling, but present day Miami
Beach. No sooner has she kicked
campaigning congressman Steve
Marcus (Ben Masters) off her client
list—and out of her bed—than she is
hired by the 'Chemtech Corporation',
a high-tech robotics company, to
humanise their latest project, called
Ulysses (John Malkovich). Ulysses
has been created by emotionless
scientist Dr Jeff Peters (John
Malkovich again) in his own image
but for one slight difference—Ulysses
has a heart. Ulysses is about to be
launched on a seven year mission into
outerspace to boldly go... .But first he
must be launched to the media to pay
for it. This is where Frankie comes in.
Things start as they mean to go on.
Ulysses has never seen a woman
before, and, after investigating
Frankie's anatomy, promptly short-
circuits. The solution to this is simple,
as Dr Peters demonstrates—
unscrewing Ulysses head and pressing
his reset button. Meanwhile the rest
of his body is heading off down the
corridor to wreak havoc elsewhere in
this 50s sci-fi movie style
establishment.
The rest of the story centres on
Ulysses' forbidden visits to the
outside world—wreaking havoc in a
shopping mall with Dr Banks' date,
the man-hungry lab technician Sandy
(Laurie Metcalf) and later at Frankie's
sister's wedding, having been bedded
by Frankie's best friend, the
nymphomaniac Trish (Glenne
Headly), on the way.
Susan Seidelman, director of the
over-hyped yet entertaining
Desperately Seeking Susan, leads us
through the mayhem in Miami Beach
as Frankie sets out to change Ulysses
but ends up realising how screwed-
up her own life really is in the search
for Mr Right. In this role Ann
Magnuson (The Hunger, Desperately
Seeking Susan) makes a splendid
starring debut as the outwardly
confident yet privately mixed up PR
consultant—who slowly comes to the
realisation of her love for the android.
John Malkovich (The Killing
Fields, Emperor of the Sun),despite
his previous serious parts, makes
good measure of his dual roles as Dr
Peters and Ulysses—two superficially
similar yet very different
characters—making us feel pity for
the cold-hearted doctor and endearing
us to the loveable android Ulysses.
Not up with the best, but never-the-
less it makes the grade for an
entertaining night out.
Opens tonight at the Chelsea
Cinema, Kings Road.

The Belly of an Architect
This recent release has not only a very
strange title, but also a fairly
incomprehensible storyline.
American architect Brian Dennehey,
star of Cocoon is invited to Rome to
produce an exhibition based on the
work of Louis Etierne Boulee, a
designer of the ancient city.
As his work progresses he becomes
obsessed by the Roman architect,
particularly by his belly, hence the
title, and all this because it seems that
they are destined to die in the same
way, via cancer of the stomach.
Meanwhile his wife has an affair
and gets pregnant, which upsets him
a little and he has a brief fling himself.
Everything comes to a head when at
the opening ceremony the exhibition
becomes the setting for his wife's
childbirth, and his own suicide.
The film goes nowhere, and takes
a long time over it. Cocoon was much
better.
-MUSIC-
Reading FELIX recently it occurred
to me that, although popular music is
more than adequately covered,
classical music listeners are not
catered for at all. In this column I
hope to preview concerts at the major
institutions of music in London—The
South Bank Centre and the Barbican.
I hope to point out a 'gig of the
week'(!), generally provide for
classical music fans and, I hope,
encourage others to give classical
music a chance.
There is no preview in the column
this week, but I hope to include
previews in future columns.
REVIEW
The Wasps Overture
—Vaughan Williams
Concerto for 'Cello & Orchestra
—Dvorak
Symphony No 4—Tchaikovsky
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the
Cambridge Corn Exchange,
Conductor Charles Groves, Cello
Paul Tortellier.
The names of Paul Tortellier and the
RPO combined to ensure the concert
was a sell out—and the tickets were
expensive. Although he is now 74
years old, the French master is surely
the top cellist in the world, following
the death of Pierre Fourniet a couple
of years ago.
Before we heard The Man, we first
were presented with a short piece
written by one of England's greatest
composers, Ralph Vaughan-Williams
(who once studied further down
Prince Consort Road at the RCM).
The Wasps was written as incidental
music to a Cambridge University
production of Areslophanes' play of
the same name. Although I'm not a
great fan of English pastorale music,
I was pleasantly surprised and the
imitation of a wasp by the strings
was interesting.
Dvorak's cello concerto in B minor
is arguably the greatest work for solo
cello every written. Unusually, the
first movement's two main themes are
introduced before the solo instument
is heard. The second of these, the
'prairie theme' was played with great
sensitivity by the French horn player
whose slight error in a top note would
not have been noticed by those who
had not heard the piece before.
Then Tortellier entered with a
repeat of the first theme, his
arrogance in performance well suited
the music. Tortellier's dazzling
fingerwork makes watching him play,
a real experience. And during long,
orchestral sections the way in which
he pushes away his cello, legs crossed
and both hand resting on the floor
makes one wonder whether he will
make the next entrance on time!
Tortellier's playing wasn't all good.
I felt his tuning was very heavy in
places and he seemed to slide
haphazardly into some of the notes.
However, there was a lovely moment
when the cello plays against solo
violin and flute. Barry Griffiths
(leader), Tortellier and the flautist
played as if they were the only ones
there.
After the concerto both Graves and
Tortellier took four curtain calls,
reinforcing the suspicion that these
concerts are merely ego trips for the
big names concerned.
After the interval, Tchaikovski's
fourth, with its characteristic chords
and fast, repeated passages for the
whole orchestra brought a fitting end
to a very enjoyable concert.
