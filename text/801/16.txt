There should be a redirection of
money away from the military
towards civil science.' In comparison,
the pressure group Save British
Science, is calling for an immediate
cash injection of £ 1 0 0 m into
university science.
The main concentration of IC
Military-funded research contracts are
in the departments of Aeronautics and
Mechanical Engineering, although
there are significant numbers of
contracts in Electrical Engineering
and Metallurgy.
Prof. Spalding's work in the
Computational Fluid Dynamics Unit
comes in for special mention, as it is
funded by the nuclear weapons
research establishment at
Aldermarston, and concerns the
theory of a nuclear explosion and has
a key role in the theoretical design of
nuclear weapons.
The recently announced
Interdisciplinary Research Centre
(IRC) at Imperial into future
generations of electronic computer
chips is hoping to have £ 2 m coming
from the Ministry of Defence, with
the remaining £ 8 m coming from the
University Grants Committee and
research councils. The plans for the
centre are due to be confirmed in
June.
Grants from the USA Department
of Defence at Imperial totalled
$128,000, in 1985, the last year that
figures are available, spent in
departments including Aeronautics,
Chemical Engineering and
Mechanical Engineering.
The only SDI, or "star wars
research contract known was at Royal
Holloway and Bedford New College
as part of a contract with other
universities throughout the country.
There has been widespread opposition
to the Star Wars programme amongst
academics, and a pledge against it has
been signed by 60% of academic staff
in departments most affected
nationally.
The report 'Military Research in
London's universities and
polytechnics' is availaDie for £ 3 . 5 0

Central Stores saga
College's decision to close Central
Stores has been strongly criticised in
a report published this week by IC's
Joint Trades Union Committee. The
report was prepared by six members
of the Committee who have specific
knowledge of the Stores.
Although the Committee agreed
that the present system was
unsatisfactory and not fulfilling its
customers' needs, it disputed the
College's conclusion that the Stores
should be shut. The report identified
several common shortfalls in the
service and proposed solutions to the
problems. These problems include the
large number of items 'temporarily
out of stock', low turnover of some
lines of stock, inadequacy of Stores
catalogues and wasteful organisation
of space and staff.
The report recommended the
appointment of a College Purchasing
Officer, who would be able to remove
obsolete stock and consult
Departments and administrative
sections in order to investigate their
needs. Ordering and stock control
could be run on a new microcomputer
system, eventually leading to
electronic mailing of customers
orders. It was also proposed that the
counter opening hours be extended
and the Catalogue include more
detailed descriptions.
The Committee justified the
expense of these measures by pointing
out that there had been very little
investment in the Stores over several
years, although there had been losses
of staff and space over the same
period. The report concluded that
these initial expenses would be
outweighed by. an increase in
efficiency, which would provide the
most cost-effective service for the
administration and Departments of the
College.

Union
squashes
debate
Imperial College Debating Society
was left unable to put on the planned
debate on South African trade,
yesterday, due to a last minute request
from IC Union not to go ahead.
Hoping to have a balanced debate on
the subject of sanctions, the Debating
Society had attempted to get a main
opposing speaker to Jan Castalyn of
the South African Embassy.
However, Anti Apartheid have a
policy of 'no platform' and therefore
wouldn't provide a speaker. Also
unwilling to share a platform with Mr
Castalyn were the Zambian,
Zimbabwean and other African
embassies contacted. The Labour
Party couldn't provide a speaker due
to a problem with communications at
their headquarters and the District
Elections which occurred on the day
of the debate.
Therefore the Debating Society
asked Sydney Harbour-Bridge to be
the main opposing speaker which he
was willing to do until he received a
phone call from national Anti-
Apartheid last Friday evening. A
meeting of IC Union Executive on
Wednesday decided that it would
delay Union participation until the
Council meeting on May 16—after the
day of the debate. An attempt was
made to continue with a general
discussion on the freedom of speech
which the Debating Society
committee thought was at stake. A
picket of College Anti-Apartheid
members asked people not to go into
Mech Eng 220 where the debate was
being held. The President of the
Debating Society, Lynda Matthews
spent forty minutes asking them to go
into the debate to explain their point
of view, as they would not have to
share a platform with a representative
from the South African Embassy.
However, they said that they were
totally against participating.
Mark Gialanze, Vice Chairman of
the Debating Society said 'the role of
the Debating Society is at stake.
Should we or should we not promote
discussion.' The Society hopes to hold
a debate next term when they can find
someone willing to oppose a speaker
from the South African Embassy.
