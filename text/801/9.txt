Is depression getting you down?
Summer Term is
upon us and for
most the dreaded
exams are once
again a reality.
Many students get
the 'blues' now
again about their
course, lack of
revision, personal
life or financial
worries. We feel
miserable, head-
achy, irritable,
constantly tired and
may not even want
to get out of bed.
Usually these
moods pass, but in
some the phase gets
worse. That's when
there's a danger of
sinking into
depression.
The word 'depression', used by most
in its loosest form to mean run down
and sad, really means a series of very
intense feelings ranging from being
down-hearted to utter hopelessness
and despair.
A severe depression can be
dangerous. Once a person passes the
point of caring what happens to them,
they become apathetic and disregard
all advice. The depression can disrupt
the sufferer's life leaving them unable
to study, attend lectures or even leave
their rooms. They can be full of self-
pity, agitated, unkempt and, in
extreme cases, talk of suicide.
Depression only becomes an illness
when it goes on for an extended time
and begins to swamp all other
feelings. In Britain, depressive illness
occurs in several million people at
least once during their lives. It can
occur in anyone at any age but
students are particularly susceptible
to the pressures of academic life and
living on a student grant. Female
students are more likely to seek
medical advice for depression,
whereas research has shown that men
tend to 'hide' their symptoms behind
illness, anti-social behaviour and
alcohol.
There are two types of depression:
reactive (non-biological) and
endogeneous (biological) depressions.
Reactive depression is an
overwhelming reaction to external
conditions which is the prevalent form
at this time of year. Endogeneous
depression results from biochemical
changes within the brain and is
usually independent of environmental
factors.
There are many symptoms of
depression. They range from sleep
disturbances, appetite loss or
increased eating, mood changes
throughout each day, lack of sex
drive, lack of concentration, loss of
energy, loss of interest in anything
important, low self-esteem, morbid
thoughts and hypochondria.
Many of us have certainly felt all
of these symptoms at some time but
could you recognise whether your
depression is just mild and short-lived
or becoming a depressive illness?
The depression is only an illness
when the symptoms start to control
your life. If you recognise all the
symptoms in yourself, try to think
back to when you first began to feel
them. Then find a friend who you can
trust and who you know will listen to
you. Tell them everything.
This may help you to sort out your
problems by giving a different
perspective to the situation. If you feel
there is nobody who will listen
sympathetically, then give Nightline
a ring. Not only do they provide
information on all aspects of being a
student in London, but they have
people who are prepared to listen and
give good advice. Alternatively there
is the Student Counsellor, Don
Adlington, who is available during
office hours. You can also try to
alleviate your symptoms in several
ways: make plans for fun, buy
yourself a treat or listen to some
music, exerciseâ€”physical exertion
makes both your body and mind feel
better and learn to relax. These may
seem reckless when you've got exams
next week but you'll find you'll get
so much more achieved if you can
pull yourself out of the depression
NOW.
Many depressions disappear
spontaneously, but if none of the self-
help actions work then you should go
straight to your doctor. Don't be
afraid that he will brush you off just
because your illness isn't pnysical.
Every doctor sees at least one person
a day with depression or anxiety. Just
remember that depression isn't mental
illness.
When you see your doctor,
describe all your symptoms and the
possible causes. He will probably give
you a brief physical examination to
put your mind at rest about any
physical symptoms. He will then
either refer you to a clinical
pyschologist or prescribe anti-
depressant medication. Sometimes
even both.
If he believes that you are just over-
anxious about your exams rather than
depressed, he may prescribe
tranqulillisers.
If you are feeling down and it is
really going to effect your exam
performance, talk to someone now.
The important decisions you should
be taking will be depressed decisions
and not the normal decisions you
would make. If you don't confront
your life and you let the symptoms
take over then you can wreck your
degree, your future career and,
ultimately, your life.
