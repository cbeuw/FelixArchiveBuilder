Examinations, Anxiety and Commonsense
Written, formal
examinations have
a hallowed place in
academic life, and
while, from time to
time,
educationalists have
espoused alternative
methods, they are
widely accepted as
the fairest and most
efficient means of
assessing students'
knowledge and
understanding.

The written examination is not,
however, by any means a precise
instrument. It is certainly possible, for
example, on individual papers, to
come up with a 'fluke' result, that is
a result markedly better than the
student's actual ability would have led
one to expect. It is also
unquestionably possible to come up
with results that are worse than either
the student or his teachers anticipated,
and which do not fairly reflect the
student's ability.
The risk of systematically
underperforming in a set of
examinations is linked to two
separate, but closely related, factors:
(a) an inadequate technique for
playing the examination game, and (b)
an inadequate recognition that a
formal examination, like any other
testing situation, can generate levels
of anxiety which in themselves may
have an adverse effect on intellectual
functioning.
Playing the examination game
Examinations are to some extent an
abstraction from reality, an artificial
construct. They are a sort of game in
which the participants are invited to
demonstrate what they know, in
writing, on a blank piece of paper, in
a set time. An important component
of the game is that the examiner is
forbidden to give credit on any other
evidence than that presented in the
script. It is an astonishing fact that
despite this elementary point, some
students insist on, abandoning
common sense to the extent,
apparently, of playing another game
altogether. A common manifestation
of this is the student who spends an
hour and three quarters (out of three
hours) writing, re-writing, polishing
and perfecting one answer out of four
or five required.
Another common departure from
the rules consists in writing out the
answer without properly reading the
questions. There are two, equally
devastating variants to this: (a) not
selecting the questions which optimise
the candidate's chances of scoring
high over-all, and (b) misreading
individual questions and subsequently
writing an answer to a question which
in effect is not there.
Some basic and well recognised
components of a good examination
technique are as follows:
1. Read the question paper
| carefully, preferably twice. Errors of
perception are high correlated with
heightened anxiety.
2. Select the questions you are
going to answer, put them in order,
and write out a simple timetable,
allowing the same time to all
questions (assuming the same
maximum marks for each). Allow
fifteen minutes for the planning and
five minutes at the end for finishing
off. Some people find it helps to make
quick notes on each question at this
stage.
3. Be disciplined in adhering to the
timetable. Recognise that the first few
marks accruing to a question can be
obtained far more easily than the last
few—and it is the total mark which
counts. If you get stuck in the middle
of a question leave it and deal with
the next one. You can always return
to the unfinished answer later, and
indeed the very act of disengaging
from the difficulty may allow a
resolution to surface which your mind
is actually focussed on something
else.
4. Answer the easiest question first,
so that you can proceed to the others
on a psychological 'high'.
5. Don't be afraid to make rough
notes in your answer book. When you
are answering one question, ideas
relating to other questions you are
going to answer may come into your
head—jot them down. Similarly on
entering the examination room, and
possibly before reading the paper at
all, you may wish to write down very
quickly salient points which you have
memorised in your final preparation.
It is, of course, essential to rule out
rough work very clearly, so that the
examiner knows that it does not form
part of your answer.
6. If you run out of time, tell the
examiner so, and say which points
you would have gone on to discuss if
you had more time.
Dealing with anxiety
A degree of anxiety, accompanied by
recognised physiological symptoms,
is a normal reaction to testing and
stressful situations. Everyone is
affected to some extent and should be
aware of it. You tell yourself that you
are anxious, that it is natural, and that
you can handle it. In doing that, you
minimise the risk that the anxiety may
escalate to a point where it becomes
disabling. Again there seem to be
some common sense ways of handling
this problem.
Arrive early—far better be biting
your nails outside the examination
room, than sitting in a traffic jam in
Earl's Court. Once you are in the
examination room, sit down and relax
for a minute or two before doing
anything.
To a certain extent anxiety is
contagious. If you feel that this is a
hazard for you, then 'keep yourself
to yourself before admission to the
examination room. It may also be
worthwhile resisting the impulse to
compare notes with all your friends
immediately after an exam.
It is also a good idea in the
examination itself, not to let yourself
be thrown if your neighbours appear
to be writing with more facility than
you are. They may, for all you know,
be writing rubbish, and in any case,
inordinately long answers do not
necessarily bring the best results.
The most common symptoms of
anxiety getting out of hand, is an
overwhelming sense of panic, a
temporary breakdown of our rational
and ordered response to a demanding
situation. In an examination this may,
for example, take the form of
'blanking out'—completely forgetting
everything. The remedy for this is to
switch off, close your eyes, and do
nothing for a while.
This is far better than yielding too
easily to the powerful impulse to
resolve the tension by giving up
altogether. When you feel that the
anxiety attack has abated, try getting
your mind working again by using a
'scribble technique'. Just write
down—any words—which lead to
other words, until you feel that your
faculty of recall is available to you
again.
A final point. If you have a history
of becoming particularly anxious at
exam times, or if for contingent
reasons you think that you may do so
this time, it would be sensible to talk
to someone about it well beforhand.
Tell your personal tutor or your
senior tutor, talk to a doctor or nurse
at the Health Centre, or come to see
me. Just a small amount of practical
help may make a substantial
difference in the event.
