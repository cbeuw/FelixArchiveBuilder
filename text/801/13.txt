ICYHA
Get out
of London
There is an advertisement on the
Underground featuring a photograph
of an imposing Scottish mountain with
a loch in the foreground, captioned
'Above and Beyond the Northern
Line'. One such place of similar
tranquil splendour is Gairloch, about
100 miles from Fort William on the
North West coast of Scotland,
destination of this year's ICYHA
Easter camping trip.
For those feeling energetically
disposed, the Torridon Mountains,
the oldest and arguably some of the
most impressive in the British Isles,
were close at hand. We satisfied
ourselves with ascents of Ben Eighe
(972m) and Ben Alligin (922m)—they
may not be quite the loftiest of
mountains, but any lack of height is
simply compensated for in the drama
of the surrounding scenery.
Unfortunately, in both cases our
arrival at the summit coincided with
that of a blizzard, so any planned
ridge-walking was thwarted.
For those of a more sedentary
disposition, there were low-level
coastal walks by Loch Ewe and Loch
Torridon, providing admirable
opportunities to spend an indolent
hour or two lazing on one of the many
deserted sandy beaches, admiring the
view, contemplating problem sheets
undone, or keeping watch for that
elusive sea otter (which, as a matter
of interest, we never saw).
The total cost of the trip was £ 7 0
per person (including all food) and
represented excellent value for a week
spent in one of the more isolated
corners of Britain—a pleasant change
from the clamour of London.
BALLOON
Summer take off
We are looking for anybody who will
be around London during the summer
(including all you postgrads) and
would be interested in finding out
more about balloons and helping to
crew on some of our ballooning
weekends all around the country. We
also desperately need a few more IC
van drivers. You need to be over 21,
have a clean license for eighteen
months and also need to take a
(simple) IC van test which we can
help to arrange.
Ever fancied flying? Now may be
your chance! If you would like to
know more about what we do as a
club then read on. Better still, come
to one of our regular Thursday
lunchtime meetings at 1pm in
Southside Upper Lounge (just ask
around for the balloonists!). We will
also be meeting (socially) Thursday
evenings as well at 7pm (same place
or in the Bar). You can also contact
me via the RCC pigeonholes (in the
Union Office).
As a club, we had planned two trips
over Easter. In the end we only went
on one trip (the second was cancelled
due to rain, wind and low cloud) to
Great Missenden, to what is called the
'April fool's Balloon Meet'. The
CANOE
White Water Wetting
After the initial problems of not
having anyone to drive the minibus,
and a disappointing lack of numbers,
we set off for North Wales at about
9 o'clock on Friday, the last day of
term, for what was to be four days
of excellent canoeing.
Saturday morning was wasted as
four of the group were prevented
from paddling the Aberglaslyn Gorge
near Beddgelert by the local water
bailiff, (access to good white water
is quite a problem in England and
Wales).
Instead we drove to Capel Curig
and all six of us paddled the River
Llugwy which was a bit more suitable
for the less competent (or is it more
sensible), of us.
On Sunday the prospect of the Fairy
Glen on the River Conwy reduced the
group of madmen to three.
Fortunately three regular paddlers of
this grade V stretch, (gradings of
rivers range from I—flat water, to
VI—nigh-on impossible) were setting
off at the same time and helped show
our three down. The river was rough
enough to send Nigel (our Chairman)
on the first swim of his paddling
career.
Due to a lack of water in the area
we moved down to Bala where the
River Tryweryn international white
water centre is sited.
Monday was spent here—the dam
controlled river providing non-stop
grade III and IV water where many
top canoeing competitions are held.
On Monday night we explored Bala
Town itself (well cafe and pub
basically) and on Tuesday we paddled
the River Winion near Dolgellau.
This time we didn't get kicked off the
river until we had finished paddling.
A quick lunch stop and then on to
the River Eden where the water (so
I'm told) was disappointingly low,
which saw an end to our canoeing
activities.
If the recent article in FELIX put
you off the Canoe Club, take heart,
we try hard not to kill off our
members.
In the near future a more placid
weekend to Symonds Yat on the River
Wye is planned. So, if you're
interested in that, have anything to
offer us, or think we have anything
to offer you, come along on Tuesday
nights, 6.30 in the Beit Quadrangle
for a session in the swimming pool,
or 8.30 in Southside Lounge for a
drink and a chat.
weather forecasts for the Easter
weekend had not looked good
(depression and an approaching cold
front) but undaunted we loaded up the
balloon Thursday evening hoping for
at least one flight in the morning. We
also had to buy an OS map which our
retrieve crew were missing and which
was essential if they weren't to get
lost when chasing the balloon around
Buckinghamshire!
Friday morning we got up at 5am
and drove down to Missenden for the
pilot's briefing at 6.30am (we
balloonists are suckers for
punishment—it was a beautiful
sunrise, if that's any consolation?).
The morning flight was amazing,
the balloons bobbing in the gorgeous
sunshine around us—could the
weatherman have been wrong
(again)? Friday evening was a little
breezy for our liking. We decided to
remain safely on the ground and
watched as many others burnt holes
in their balloons attempting to take
off.
On Saturday the weather was
perfect again and we had two superb
flights. Then on Sunday morning we
had our fourth flyable slot to finish
off a great weekend.
Happy landings,
Jan Vonka (Chairman).
