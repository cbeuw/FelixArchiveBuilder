VOLLEYBALL
BUSF Championship (Men)
Following strong performances in the
London league, EVA Student Cup,
and the UAU competitions, it was no
surprise that London University
would be represented by a
supplemented Imperial side (of 10
players, 7 were from IC) there were
very few talented players available
from other colleges, it was generally
assumed that London would be a
weak team this year. This proved not
to be the case, London found
themselves in the same group as
Scotland (winners 8 times in the last
decade) UAU II and Wales, and faced
immediate problems when facing
Scotland ten minutes after a seven
hour coach ride. London never looked
awake, and struggled against an
almost equally anaemic Scottish side
to lose by 2 sets to 1. It looked bad:
UAU 0 were allegedly stronger than
either Scotland or London, as they
suggested by beating Wales and the
Scots, and London were in danger of
having another lacklustre tournament.
Fortunately, London met Wales next,
and trounced them 15-2, 15-5 to boost
confidence for the battle to come.
UAU II were obviously not expecting
much, On court, they behaved as if
they had a right to a place in the final,
which cost them dear. Five minutes
into the first set, London were 10-1
up, and finished at 15-3. UAU were
amazed, and had to show all their
strength to block out the firepower of
Walter Sextro and captain Steve
Pickett and take the second set 15-11.
In the third, several players picked a
good time to play their best
volleyball. On back court, Vincent
Lebeault scurried about and retrieved
impossible spikes, whilst the setters,
Luca Grassano and Julian Puczyniec
blocked (and set) superbly. After two
match points, London finally took the
game 15-13, and a place in the semi-
final. Unfortunately, here Northern
Ireland were too strong, and won 2-0
which was somewhat anticlimatic.
The sweetener was the chance for
revenge over Scotland, beaten by
UAU I in the other semi-final, which
London gladly took (2-0) for a well-
deserved bronze medal.
Final placings:
Gold: UAU I
Silver: Northern Ireland
Bronze: London
4th: Scotland
5th: UAU II
6th: Cambridge
7th: Oxford
8th: Wales

Paul Shanley
As predicted last week, Doyoun was
the'winner of Saturday's 2000
Guineas at Newmarket. Trainer,
Michael Stoute, has doubts over
entering his colt for the Derby. He
seems concerned whether or not
Doyoun has the stamina to step up an
extra half mile for the trip at Epsom
on June 1. Most bookies have now
dropped the Aga Khan's selection
from their show of betting.
Ladbrokes, however, do quote 5-1,
'with a run'.
Playschool, the horse that I now see
in my nightmares is in the news again.
Last week's Sunday Express alleged
that a new undetectable drug is in use.
The report claimed that the diuretic
was used on David Baron's colt on St
Patrick's Day. This allegedly
explained his poor showing in the
Cheltenham Gold Cup. The Jockey
Club rejected the report on Sunday
following analysis of a urine sample
taken from the horse.
Finally, a reminder that we're
hoping to get Racing Soc off the
ground for next term. Anyone
interested, please reply to Box 721,
FELIX, Beit Quad. The tips for this
week are on the news pages.
What can you
buy for
£35,000?
• 175,000 Mars Bars-At 3000
calories a day, this lasts 45 years, 37
weeks.
• 210,000 condoms—These hold
6,720,000 pints of lager.
• 10 Union Presidents' salaries.
• 41,176 pints of Becks. To take
these back to Evelyn Gardens from
the Union Bar would take 43 round

• 564 return flights to Dublin.
• Enough matches to stretch 1000
miles which is a very long, long way
indeed.
• Feed half the population of Milton
Keynes for a year. Why anyone
would want to do this is unclear.
• Buy a triple room in Bernard
Sunley for 45 years including
vacations.
• Stock the new 'FELIX soft drinks
and pastie shop' for an awfully long
time.
• 564 colour TV licenses (564 more

Gastronomic Survey of
the world—Part 1
FRANCE
A visit to France is an opportunity for
one of life's great gastronomic
adventures. I will restrict my
comments to Paris because my
personal experience of eating in
France does not extend into the
Provinces. There will be the
opportunity in future editions of
FELIX to extend what I have to say
here. Any useful info can be passed
to me on int 4320 or 4412.
On a student budget I would give
priority to exploring the world of
fromageries and charcuteries.
Fromageries
It is important to remember that some
of the dedicated fromageries buy their
cheese from the farmers and age it in
their own cellars on straw. I would
recommend that you search out the
ones that specialise in raw milk
(unpasteurised) cheese (fromage au
lait cru). The cheeses that I tried
covered much of the spectrum:
Camembert—7he favourite cheese in
France. You will find a raw milk
cheese Camembert very creamy.
Brie—Even though it might be a
familiar cheese, it must be tried in
France.
Munster.
Livarot.
Bouton-de-Chevre—Small diskettes of
goat cheese.
Vieux Lille—A strong pungent cheese.
This was my favourite. I liked it so
much that I brought back a couple of
pounds of the stuff. I would often end
the day by having some on bread,
accompanied by a cognac.
The adventurous amongst you
might want to go through a
'degustation'. This is a sampling of
the cheeses from every branch of the
French cheese spectrum. It can be a
single sampling accompanied by an
explanation of the background of
every cheese encountered or it can be
an elaborate multi-course meal
consisting only of cheeses. One starts
with the light ones and finishes in a
finale of blues.
The degustation at Andrust
Fromagerie (41 Rue d'Amsterdam,
Metro-Liege) was brought to my
attention. It might prove a little pricey
as this establishment is one of Paris's
top fromageries.
Charcuteries
You should be able to find one quite
easily. Here, you will find the
opportunity to make a selection from
a range of hams, pates and sausages.
Many charcuteries will provide tables
where you can sit down to enjoy your
selection with some bread and house
wine.
I found that I was quite lost when
asking for things. Any knowledge of
French food terminology will prove
a saviour. I am giving a very short
list of terms in the hope that the
charcuterie you visit will have the
products that I mention.
Boudin noir—Pork blood sausages.
Jambon d'Auvegre—Raw, salt-cured
smoked ham.
Jambon de Bayonne—Raw, salt-cured
ham.
Lard—Bacon.
Saucisson sec—Air dried sausages.
The Chedeville at 12 rue du
Marche-Saint-Honors (Paris 1, Metro
Tuillerie) has a reputation for stocking
a very wide selection of prepared
meat. You might like to go to this one
if you are in the area.
You will have done yourself a great
favour if you manage to explore this
small niche in the French gastronomic
domain, in between seeing the Louvre
and the Musee d'Orsay.
Bye for now,
Yishu.
PS. Don't forget to bring me some
Vieux Lille.
Special tip: You must must try
'Pain Poilane au Levain naturel'. This
is a very special sourdough bread,
first made by the Paris baker Lionel
Poilane. This should be able to be
purchased at most boulangeries.
