The McLaren domination of last
Sunday's San Marino Grand Prix was
quite remarkable in what is really a
transitional year for the team and
Formula One. Ayrton Senna's win (as
predicted last week) puts real pressure
on Alain Prost as they head for Monte
Carlo on May 15th. Between them
Prost and Senna have won the last five
Monaco Grand Prix and it should be
a fascinating struggle. More next
week on that.
The two most important races this
weekend are rounds of the Sports-
Prototypes World Championship
(SPWC) and F3000 International
Championship.
For the SPWC teams Sunday's
Autosport 1000 teams at Silverstone
(on the A43 between Brackley and
Towcester in Northamptonshire)
represents the last chance to get in
some serious racing miles before the
Le Mans 24 hour classic next month.
The series so far has turned out to
be a battle between the Tom
Walcinshaw Racing Jaguar XJR-9's
and the sole Sauber-Mercedes C9.
The leading Jaguar of American
Grand Prix driver Eddie Cheever and
former British GP driver Martin
Brundle has won the last two rounds
of the championship at Monza, Italy
and Jarama, Spain but trails in the
championship, 25 points behind
Sauber drivers Jean-Louis Schlezzer
and Mauro Baldi who won the first
round at Jerez, Spain and finished
second in the other two races. Also
appearing at Le Mans, but not
Silverstone, will be the factory
Porsche team, with last year's
winning trio of drivers: Derek Bell,
Hans Stuck and Al Holbert. Jaguar
have spared no expense to end
Porsche's domination, entering five
cars for Le Mans. One of Jaguar's
fifteen drivers for the race (three per
car) will be 1986 British Formula
Three Champion Andy Wallace. On
Sunday Andy will be driving his Ratt
RT22 in the second round of the
F3000 International series at
Vallelunga, Italy. The first round at
Jerez saw debut victory for both
Johnny Herbert and the Reynard
chassis. Second through to fifth were
Lola T88/50S, designed in
Huntingdon by IC graduate Mark
Williams. 28 year old Mark
completed his degree in Mechanical
Engineering in 1980 and, having been
interested in motor racing design
since the age of ten, decided to look
for a job in the field. The College
careers service were less than
supportive, advising Mark to 'get a
proper job instead'. He obliged by
going to work for a firm of consulting
engineers but successfully applied for
a job at Lola Cars in 1983. After
working on cars for the American
'Indycar' series Mark took over
responsibility for F3000 in 1985,
designing the T950, which was a bit
too slow to win any races. The
T86/50 and T87/50 won races in 1986
and 1987 but both times the
championship was lost to arch rivals
March. This year appears to be better
news for Mark and Lola as the
Marches were considerably off the
pace at Jerez. Lola should have the
strength in depth to beat Reynard over
the season and my favourites for the
title are the French GBDA team, who
are planning to enter Formula One
next year, and will want to progress
with style. Next week: Monaco GP
preview and the start of the build up
to the world's biggest sporting event.

It is the last Saturday of the football
season when things used to be usually
be decided. But with these play-off
nightmares, some teams have three
weeks to sweat it out.
Chelsea v Charlton
Stamford Bdg (Fulham Bdy tube)
This is it. The crunch battle to end all
battles. The fixtures computer must
be laughing its little chips off. The
state of the teams is simple. A draw
or win for Charlton equals safety. A
win only for Chelsea gives them
security. Any opposite results puts the
other team in the play-off position
with third, fourth and fifth teams of
Division Two. Chelsea were
demolished at West Ham last week
and looked a poor and desperate side.
Charlton drew with Spurs to equal
Chelsea's 41 point total, thanks to an
equalising penalty and mostly feel
confident. This should be a classic but
might end up as a war. A neutral
would love the amosphere, so be there
or be square. I predict a draw and
disaster for Chelsea.
Crystal Palace v Manchester City
Selhurst Park (Selhurst BR)
This is a crucial game for the home
team. Palace have had a great year but
could still miss out on even a play-
off place. They lost to Leeds last week
but also beat Blackburn to keep up a
challenge. They must win here and
hope that Blackburn don't win their
last game. If they finish fifth, they
could be playing Charlton in the play-
offs, a home, I mean away game, well
actually it is the same! Man City are
a good young side and I will tip them
to win this league next year. Players
like Lake, Redmond and Stewart are
stars of the future and hold the key
for light blue success. Palace should
win this, but it will be close.
Millwall v Blackburn
The Den (New Cross tube)
Congratulations to the Lions on
achieving a place in the top flight for
the very first time. They have won the
title as well, so this all looks well for
the future among the big boys. The
victory at Hull last week was
witnessed by many thousands of
Millwall fans and they should turn out
in force to greet their favourites.
Blackburn, as I have said, are in a
tussle, with Crystal Palace, so
Millwall could do their London
neighbours a favour here. Archibald
was absent last week and they could
only draw at home with lowly
Reading. I predict a home win and the
possible end of the Blackburn dream.
Brentford v York
A Division Three game of no real
promotion or relegation relevance.
Leyton Orient v Wolves
Brisbane Road (Leyton tube)
Yet another make or break match in
this lower division matching. Orient
must win to confirm a place in the
play-offs and the real chance of a
deserved Division Three place next
year. Frank Clark must be hoping for
the best possible performance.
Wolves are champions. They have
completed the first leg of their climb
back to the top flight which I think
they will attain eventually. Steve Bull
has scored over 50 goals for them this
year and his successes cannot be
praised highly enough. Wolves fans
have dubious reputations but they
deserve the success that the team has
provided. I will go for a hard-fought
draw.
All games are on May 7 (Saturday)
with 3pm kick-offs.
Game of the Day: Chelsea v
Charlton (go along to this one if you
can afford the time).
ONE WEEK TO THE
CUP FINAL!!
Bye for now,
