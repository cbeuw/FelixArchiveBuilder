Thanks
I'd like to take this opportunity to
thank Dave, Chris, Pippa, Paul,
Kamala and Sunny for staying up all
night with me on Wednesday. It is
entirely due to these six tireless
individuals that we were able to bring
out our flysheet yesterday morning.
Cheers!
Secrets, secrets
I would have liked to have brought
you up-to-date on much more
information regarding the Union
Snack Bar and Bar Staff in this issue.
Many important decisions have been
taken since our flysheet was brought
out yesterday but the Union Executive
have decided not to release any
information until later this morning.
I fully understand the need to inform
those directly concerned before the
press. For this reason I will probably
be bringing out another flysheet next
week if there are anymore
developments.
Keys
I am becoming increasingly
concerned by the number of people
in this College who have collections
of master keys from all over the
campus. It is quite clear that College
administration should seriously think
about changing the locks throughout
residences. The Union has already
recognised the need to change all the
barrels within the Union Building,
which I am assured will be done in
the very near future.
Where do we go to eat now?
Now they've shut down the Union
Snack Bar for five months where do
we have to go for lunch in College?
Kebabs and pizzas are pleasant when
restricted to once or twice a week but
this leaves the dire Sherfield Main
Refectory or QT Burger Bar. People
have suggested that FELIX open a
food and drink outlet in our office
because we have a fridge, a
microwave and a coffee machine.
Sorry to disappoint you, folks, but it's
bad enough trying to get a paper out
each week!
St Mary's
Congratulations to Phil Drew who has
been re-elected as the St Mary's
Union President. I look forward to
meeting him next year and seeing how
he helps to integrate the Medical
School with the rest of Imperial.
Annual Reports
All Union Officers will have their
annual reports printed in a special
Executive News to be distributed in
the middle of next week's FELIX.
They should make jolly interesting
reading!
If you think you may be a Union
Officer, sit down and take several
deep breaths. Then telephone me if
you haven't yet written your annual
report to let me know when it will be
ready. If you are a Union Officer and
you don't submit a report in time,
then you will be submitted to the
uncontrollable wrath of Chas Jackson!
Staff Meeting
There will be a staff meeting at
1.00pm today in the FELIX Office.
We will be discussing life, the
universe and the last issue of this year.
Be there!
