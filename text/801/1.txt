Deputy President's
future uncertain
Mystery surrounds the future of Imperial College Union's Deputy
President Alan Rose following emergency meetings of the Union's
Investigatory Committee and Executive Committee last night. The
closed meetings were called to discuss possible actions to be taken
against Mr Rose who has overall sabbatical responsibility for the Union
Snack Bar and Bar.
As was revealed in yesterday's special
edition of FELIX, stock with a retail
value of £35,000 in the Snack Bar and
£6,000 in the Bar is currently
unaccounted for this year. Both the
Snack Bar Manager, Mr Norman
Jardine, and his deputy, Mark
Anderson, have been suspended on
full pay until their inquiries have been
held. All the casual bar staff have also
been dismissed from their jobs.
Some members of the dismissed
casual bar staff are calling for a
boycott of the Union Bar, until their
names have been cleared.
A petition calling for an ICU
Extraordinary General Meeting to
discuss the Executive's decisions has
been organised by ex-Snack Bar
casual staff. It is being circulated
around College lecture theatres today.
Mr Jeremy Pauley, one of the
organisers, told FELIX yesterday that
he was 'worried about the lack of
information' that had been given to
Union members. They will need to
collect at least 150 signatures before
a meeting can be called.
Meanwhile, details of the decisions
made by the Union Executive last
night will be made public later today,
after Mr Rose has been informed.
Rag Fete 'a great success'
This year's Imperial College Union Rag Fete was held last Saturday on
the Queens Lawn. It was officially opened by Matilda Zeigler and Lucy
Bayler of EastEnders. The photo above shows ICU President Sydney

A report published this week reveals
that Imperial College has 'by far the
highest number of Ministry Defence
Contacts' of London's Universities
and Polytechnics. The report was
published on Wednesday by
CAMROC, the Campaign against
military research on campus, and
concludes that virtually every London
university and polytechnic has been
carrying out military research in the
last few years.
About 52% of the £4,500m total of
government funded research and
development in the country is funded
by the Ministry of Defence, and a
spokesperson for CAMROC said that
'we believe that this is not healthy for
