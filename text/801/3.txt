IC Radio
go on F M
The Department of Trade and
Industry granted Imperial College
Radio a licence to conduct test
transmissions in the VHF band on
Wednesday.
The frequency allocated is
97.7MHz, with sufficient bandwidth
to allow for stereo transmissions. The
licence is valid for an initial period
of three months. At the end of this
period, it may be extended for up to
an additional nine months at no extra
cost, but it is not renewable. This
means that IC Radio effectively has
one year to conduct a study into F M ,
which should be ample time. They are
allowed to conduct one test each day,
of up to six hours duration.
Nigel Whitfield, who holds the test
licence told FELIX this is not the start
of an FM service. Exactly what form
will be taken by the test transmissions
has not been decided.
Ents final fling
Last Saturday's Exam Blues Ball raised £850 for IC Rag. Entertainments
Chairman John Noble handed over a cheque for the amount to Rag
Chairman Nigel Baker on Wednesday afternoon.

Squatters
According to residents in Hamlet

the area. Following the occupation of
a flat over the summer, two more flats
have been taken over. Flat 212 was
unoccupied for some two months
before squatters moved in during
January. Since then, flat 135 has been
entered over Easter through a
window. When approached, the new
Accommodation Officer, Loretto
O'Callaghan, said that she knew
nothing about it.
