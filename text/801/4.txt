Second International Week: Letter
a report from Grenoble from
Unio

Residence Insurance
I have begun to send notes directly to
people when a cheque arrives or the
Insurers require further information.
This seems to work more quickly and
more efficiently than putting a note
in FELIX. I am currently engaged in
an analysis of claims from August
1986 onwards, in the hope of
throwing up figures in relation to
known security problems and other
possible problems yet to be identified.
If such areas can be acted upon,
hopefully the effect will be to prevent
sharp rises in the premium or the
success on each claim.
Club Insurance
This is an area which I wish to
transfer onto the computer,
particularly inventories. This will
enable easier updates of club
inventories at the end of each year,
before the renewal premium is
decided. All club captains and chairs
can look forward to a request nearer
the end of term for updates to their
inventories.
Cancer video
As promised last term, there will be
a video on cervical cancer in the
Union Lower Lounge today. I have
booked the room from 12-2.00pm and
will be able to show the video more
than once as it is only around fifteen
minutes long. I also have information
sheets from WHIC (Womens Health
Information Centre). This event is
open to women only.
Next year's Women's Officer will
be Gill Knowles (Mech Eng III).

At the end of last term I represented
Imperial College and the United
Kingdom at the Second International
Week held at the Institut National
Polytechnique de Grenoble (INP-G)
in France from 20-27 March.
I had a marvellous time in Grenoble
meeting students of technology from
12 other European countries. During
the week the 30 or so of us spent
together we were able to exchange
views and attitudes on the cultures and
educational systems in our countries
which in itself greatly furthered one
of the intentions of the week—to
promote Europe amongst Europeans.
As well as touring laboratories in
the prestigious INP-G we visited
some local industries in the thriving
science park and a Renault factory
near Lyons. We participated in a
debate with leading representatives of
Grenobles industry about the
European scientist/engineer of the
future. We spent a day skiing in
Prapoutel—well some of us trying
whilst for most of the others skiing
was very much a way of life. We
sampled (numerous) wines in
Beajoulais and were treated to a
traditional regional meal of veal's
instestines! But whether of the
cocktail or dinner variety, parties
were in abundance throughout the
week. It culminated with INP-FIZZ,
a 'gala' comprising fashion show,
magic show, comedian, bands and
discos attended by over 2000 people
where we were addressed by the
director of the INP-G and the mayor
of Grenoble.
So having gathered that the week
was intended to be fun (and at the
expense of local Grenoble industry)
the reasons for being there were very
important. The First International
Week was held in Stockholm in May
1987 to bring together students of
Mathematics and Physics throughout
Europe. In March 1988 Grenoble
went further than this and invited
students from the most prestigious
science institutions in Europe and of
any subject discipline to discuss how
we as students and eventually
professionals can contribute to
achieving the 1992 goal of a 'free'
Europe. And so after two days of
heated boardroom type discussions
BEST, the Board of European
Students of Technology was born. (A
multitude of acronyms were
considered but each one discarded
because it insinuated an unpleasantly
in some or other language).
BEST is currently known as the
EAU, the European Association of
Universities, and is recognised by the
French government as a non-political,
non-profit making entity. It is run by
students (those who have participated
in the International Week) for students
of technological universities in
Europe. The founder members of
BEST have compiled a set of aims:
1) To make available information
about participating universities to
interested parties.
2) To mediate between participating
universities and establish recognised
exchange schemes.
3) To mediate with industry to
encourage the long and short term
employment of European students and
engineers.
Above all, to support student
initiatives concerning European
oriented affairs where possible.
BEST is still very much in the
planning stage and will be discussed
further at the next International Week
to be held in Eindhoven, Holland in
November.
On leaving for Grenoble I did not
really consider what participating in
International Week would entail apart
from being just a free holiday. I am
now aware that I and the students of
Imperial College have an enormous
responsibility. If it has been decided
in Europe that Imperial is an
institution worthy of recognition, its
students must be worthy of Europe.
We are all aware that this is an
institution where apathy prevails and
the fact that the response for people
to participate in the International
Week was abysmal exemplified it.
The UK represents one of the largest
populations in Europe. It would be a
pity if the UK as represented by IC
could not help to advance the cause
of BEST and a 'free' Europe merely
because of the apathy of the students.
A booklet on IW '88, the events of
the week, the creation of BEST and
the educational systems of the
countries represented will be available
in limited numbers in the summer.
Anyone genuinely interested in
furthering the cause of BEST and
attending the next IW should contact
me via the pigeonholes.

St Mary's
Election fever comes to town! After
the non-event of the IC elections here,
interest is really keen with regards to
our immediate representatives. This
can be explained with the fact that in
the past our SU has been our sole
representatives, this choice of
candidate is usually very considered.
Initial returns indicate the
likelihood of a very high poll. In the
region of 400 hundred people will
vote on each alternative. With total
student numbers of approximately
600, this turn out is respectable. The
electorate have five chances to vote
at varying times this week (3rd to 5th
May).
There has been much debate in the
corridors and recreation areas as to
the correct candidate. Obviously each
camp has their own band of loyal
followers who will stick to the end,
come what may. The encouraging
sign is the debate rife among the
'thinking population'.
In all contested posts the standards
are high, so any result will not
adversely affect life here at St Mary's
or our relationship with IC. The two
big jobs, President and Secretary
(Vice President) are contested in a
two way battle for each. This
increases the chance of a considered
vote, though there is little to choose
so absentions may be high.
The system is initially first past the
post though in a three-way fight, if
the result of the third placed candidate
would have affected the final result,
a re-run will be ordered with the last
placed candidate ineligible to stand.
This is a similar system to the 'level
of preference' used in many other
student elections.
For the candidates themselves, the
time has been rather stressful. The
programme included a hustings with
free beer and wine available to those
who turned up! Thus the meeting
deteriorated as more alcohol was
consumed. Heckling grew in decibels
as the meeting proceeded, the chief
culprit being the individual serving
the free beer, who had liberally
helped himself. Natural justice was
done as later he was observed being
violently ill in the toilets. Poor guy!
