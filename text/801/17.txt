Last year Britain's Campus Radio Stations asked for your help in compiling a
Student All Time Top 50 Album Chart.
It proved to be an enormous success and led to national press coverage and a radio special with
David Jensen.
Following its success we would now like you to vote for your all time favourite singles.
The first fully completed entry form drawn from the entries received after the closing date will
receive a £ 2 5 record token.
The next 100 fully completed voting forms drawn will each receive a limited edition Nescafe Frappe
summer T-Shirt!
All you have to do is vote... vote... vote!
