The complaints system in the
College refectories is there so that
we can improve the general stand-
ard of food and service, and make
sure that no-one gets a really bad
meal. However, it will work much
more effectively if people know
how to get a complaint dealt with.
Complaints can be divided into
three broad categories :
(1) Suggestions about improving
the amenities etc.
Examples of those are com-
plaints about lack of cutlery,
trays, etc. and bright ideas for
keeping the food warmer. Put
these in the comnlaints book, and
they can be dealt with straight-
away, as such a lack is obvious on
inspection.
(2) Complaints about standards of
food. etc.
Examp'es of these are cold
peas, small portions, and lack of
choice. Please put anything like
this straight in the book. If one
person makes anv ot 'iiese com-
plaints, he could be assumed to
be, respectively, finicky, hungry,
or choosey, but if ten people all
say the same thing, then there is
certainly something wrong; and
we can try to improve matters.
Lack of choice
With particular reference .o tl.e
"lack of choice' complaint, would
you specify which dishes are
and what the time is. This way
we can more easily judge how
much extra food is needed.
(3) Complaints about a bad portion
of food, or the price being wrong.
Examples of these are foreign
bodies in the food, etc. If you
think your meal is a really bad
one, as distinct from one of low
standard (see type 2 complaints),
then the best way to deal with
this is to complain directly to
whoever is in charge of the re-
fectory staff at that time. If you
ask the cashier, she will tell you
who to see. This way you can
get a better meal, but put it in
the book as well, so that we re-
alise the meat pies, for example,
are suspect. If you do not get
satisfaction from the staff, though
1 think you will, then go straigYit
to the refectory complaints officer,
if possible with specimens (they
have been produced before).
Price increases?
If you think the price of some
meal has suddenly gone up, then
please point mis out at the time.
It could be a mistake, and il you
do something about it you could
save everyone from paying extra.
There is a fourth 'category' of
'complaint' which gets put in the
book, which usually reeds some-
think like 'Mooney, where did you
learn to cook?' Apart from wast-
ing paper, and not being very
constructive, i assure von these
comments are irrelevant—Mr
Mooney does not do the cooking.

The Exploration Society is wil
ling to provide all types of in- |
formation to the members of the
College who are planning any
kind of expedition or trek in
Europe, Asia or Africa. This in-
formation on road conditions,
food, accommodation and border
formalities has been collected from
previous journeys and expeditions
made by society members. These
personal trips siiuld prove invalu-
able to any traveller. The Explor-
ation Society would be pleased to
hear a few details of any treks or
expeditions planned for this Sum-
mer so that they can be givf-n re-
levant information and also that a
record of such trips can be kent
for future reference. It is certain
that this type of cooperation will
be useful to all present and future
travellers. Please send any inform-
ation or queries to The Secretary,
Exploration Soc., via Union Rack.

ICSASAF, or to give it its full title Imperial College South African
Schlorship Appeal Fund is now under way, and more power to it.
One of die first acts ot die last council meeting was to vote the scheme
a sum of £20 to cover initial administrative costs. The main body of
this will go towards financing individual appeals by letter to every stud-
ent at iC. This should start in early Maich. Following on from this
it is planned to approach prominent members of the staff, including Sir
William Penney, the new Rector.
It is also possible that a small
number of industrial firms, with
particular connections at IC might
be asked for donations to the fund,
but this is something for the
future, and is not being presently
considered. The whole scheme
will, in fact, be run on the lines
of a charity, and there is no sug-
gestion of a competition with the
Carnival Fund. This would inevit-
ably result in the splitting of al-
legiances and probably injure both
funds. For this, reason no rags,
stunts or processions are planned.
Another important decision is that
as far possible, the raising of
the fund will be an internal af-
fair, since the scholarship ottered
applies, of course, only to IC. By
when will the required £2>W be
acquired ? Andrew Jordan, who
together with Mike Bellchambers
is heading the Funds Committee
has set as a-tentative date the enu
of 1967, though he admits that
everything depends on the response
of students and staff. In the ia.:t
Union Meeting, which approved
ICSASAF by a large majorib
Jordan and Bellchambers wert
elected to run the fund, and both
are, of course very keen for help
of all kinds. Anyone who would
like to lend a hand should get in
touch with either as soon as pos-
sible, through a note in the Union
lack. In addition to this Andy
Jordan can be found in Tizard
Hall, room 627. If you want to
help, now is the time td* start.
