FELIX 13
Engineers' Dinner & Dance
Successful & Profitable
This year's Engineer's Dinner and Dance took place in Southside on
February 3rd and proved to be a success and what's more may have made
a slight profit, due partly to the increased ticket price and partly to the
increased numbers that could be accomodated in Southside compared to
the Union.
The menu for the dinner, at
first glance, seemed completely un-
imaginative but proved to be
quite edible. Thus those present
were well fortified, both with food
and liquid, when speech-time ar-
rived. It is a good thing they were
since anyone in a completely sober
frame of mind just could not have
sat through those speeches.
Penney speaks
First came Sir William Penney,
speaker for the night, who went
to great length to e\tol the virtues
of Guildsmen qua'jff'ing this by
saying 'If I were not going to be
the new Rector I could speak
freely and tell you what I really
think about the C and G Union.'
After explaining that he was of
RCS stock he outlined a plan to
put 'Ro' in orbit and explained
away the expenditure of the
UKAEA by putting it down to the
telephone bill!!
Pete Robert then spoke for a
few minutes about the increasing
number of students in Guilds sup-
pressing any form of rxwnn' con-
tact between the student body as
a whole and its executive but sug-
gested this could be remedied if
tne year representatives im /each
department formed an efficient
liason between them. This indeed
is what Guilds have been trying
to do this year and, it would
Buttery bar

One member of the Union who
objects to the closure of the whole
of Southside for an event such as
die Engineers' Dinner and Dance
is Roy Francis. He believes that
ordinary members of the Union
should always have access to some
part of Southside. With this in
mind he made a' successful applic-
ation to the Union for the Staff
Ruttery to be open on D and D
night. Unfortunately, the late ap-
proval of the application meant
negligible publicity and only £12
was taken in the bar.

seem, succcstully. He then, after
thanking Ted Adic and his Enter-
\ainments Committee for the sup-
erb job they had done in tho organ-
ization and preparation of the
event, presented Anthony Duke to
introduce the Guests to Sir
William.
Mr. Duke then went to great
length to introduce all the guests
and give their background details
including a few jokes and a nasty
crack at Malcolm Duckett's oppos-
ition to the appointment of the
new Rector.
Among the guests he introduced
were Lord Jackson and Professors
Neal, Ford and Owen from the
College and Messieurs Millard and
Foster from the Old Centralians,
the latter making the best speech
of the evening after Mr Duke had
finished.
The dance—to Paul London—
was enjoyed by everyone and the
cabaret, Tony Gould, though not
appealing to everyone was well
received.
The dance continued until 2.30
when this year's D and D came
to an end
— Precedent set —
This was the first time the D
and D, or indeed any function of
this kind, had been held in
Southside and from this success
this could be a precedent to other
events such as ICWA formal,
Mines Ball etc. being held there.

The Jerusalem Education Trust
(JE'l) arranges a tour .to Israel
each summer for students with no
religious or traditional ties with
that country. The holiday consists
of a jen day tour of Israel, a stay
at a Kibbutz and a seminar at the
Hebrew University Jerusalem. The
party will be flying from London
on 28nd ot August. The Trust will
award ocnolarships of £65 to all
applicants selected for this trip to
help them meet the total cost of
£115.
Several students from IC went
last summer. Further details and
application fonns may be obtained
from Gordon Weingarten (Union

Phillips on
facts & fictions
"A fact is a fiction that works."
This was the closing comment
from Prebendary Gordon Phillips
in • is OP( -in'' speech at the
Wellsor symposium on 'What is a
Fact r"
This introductory lecture con-
sisted of fifty minutes of talking
during which the speaker used .i
hrgt number of terms in a sense
different to their everyday use
without explaining their meaning
lie digressed widely from the
main subject to comment on self,
the need o! scientists to bring
systems to consistency, and the ac-
cusation thai scientists take part
in Hegelian metaphysics, in which
everything props the rest of the
system up, and there is no real
f •-•dation for any of the theory:
such as the flatness of the earth
which may no longer be helel to
be true, and so we may now have
a pcito ol time during winch we
iecu„msc two opposing tacts as
being exqually true.
Tne reaction ot il'ie durty or
so students who attended ranged
from complete boredom to deep
interest. In spice of the constant
attempt; of the speakers to side
step the main issues, the discus-
sion was lively, and owes much
of its success to the good work of
the Chairman, Dilsher Gingh Virk.
Science- the
lock or the key?
From chaos to order ? From the
disorder of the Maths and Physics
Society Committee evolved the
concept of a weekend inference.
They propose to tackle the pro-
blem of "Science—the '.ock or the
key to the future ?" A multitude
of questions arise : "Are we moral-
ly right to study science, when all
it produces is the H-bomb ?
Hasn't television destroyed the in-
dividual's right to think ? We're
handing eveivthing out to the
people irrespective of whether
they are ready and mature enough
to handle and appreciate our pre-
cious inventions."
But this rabble, the mob, who
are they ? Are scientists any bet-
ter ? Does knowing how the atom
ticks make us wiser and more fit
to live ?
Many eminent professional men
have been invited to the ;onfer-
snce and some have been willing
to give up a weekend to discuss
their ideas, their ethics—which
they are ouite prepared to have
dissected. In IC this is a subject
that should affect us all, from the
most exalted professor to the in-
dolent student.

graduates-
natural gas
The Gas industry is entering an exciting period
of expansion. Within recent years its scientists and
technologists have discovered new ways of
making gas from oil and have carried through the
project which brings liquefied natural gas to
Britain from the Sahara Desert. It is now known
that beneath the North Sea are rich reserves of
natural gas w h i c h will not only transform the
gas industry but will be of great importance to
the nation's economy.
The Engineering Research Station needs science graduates in
the fields of physics, mathematics and metallurgy, and mechanical,
electrical and electronic engineers to ensure that the nation
obtains the full advantage of this development. They are offered
rewarding careers with exceptional opportunities for advancement.
Starting salaries are negotiated individually and depend on
qualifications and experience, the initial value and the rate of
increase being well up to the levels which apply in the chemical
industry. There are opportunities for transfer to production,
engineering "r administrative sides of the industry.
