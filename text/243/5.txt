FELIX 5
C N D cont'd.
of the history and the basis tor
this war. I challenge these people,
who now suddenly claim to know
all about the situation and desper-
ately want peace, to come to
these meetings and give something
to us.
Now perhaps I may be allowed
to clear up some of the inaccur-
acies in your last edition:—
1. C.B.C. spent H-2 hours at IC
not 15 minutes.
2. I attacked the Union Exec, for
tiieir lack of help over my Union
Motion on Vietnam noi': for the
reasons you stated. May I also
point out now that" the President
has refused to sign the letters to
Vietnam.
3. I did ask staif to discuss Vietnam
whilst lecturing but did not use
the U.S. staff as precedent. In fact
I referred to the Oxbridge dons
who spoke so openly about the
Spanish Civil War.
4. There were not two counter re-
solutions over the appointmenl of
tire new Rector, the two were
both necessary and each bore the
other one out.
5. Stewart Barnes' new, twisted
version of one of the captions is
an outright lie. I have already ex-
plained this to him.
Finally to Colcutt I say that it
is not childish to defend one's
most basic principles. Y°U surelv
must know that. And don't you
think that you were just a little
childish (pr bitchy ?) when you
suggested I should disband CND
after the appointment of Penney ?
Yours faithfully
M.G. Duckett
(Chairman CND)
Ed : the members of staff concern-
ed with the articles decried
above deny the inaccuracies alleg-
ed by Mr Duckett in section «, 3,
4 and 5.
P Gs' London
allowance
Sir.
I am sure that most postgradu-
ate students financed by the
Science Research Council would
agree with me that the absence
of a London allowance is an ac -
ual injustice about which some-
thing ought to be done. It is
manifestly obvious that the cost oi
living here is higher than in the
provinces.
Undergraduates, technicians and
staff all get an extra London al-
lowance. Why not P.G.'s? The
argument that we must make a
'sacrifice' in order to get a high-
er degree is not relevant, the
point to press home to the depart-
ment of Education and Science is
that London P.G.'s should not
make any bigger a sacrifice tha
anybody else.
AS IN THE PAST the Editor
will be pleased to receive letters
for publication. However, the
right to withold letters from public-
ation, either in part or in toto, is
reserved.
THE EDITOR reminds all con-
tributors that copy for any issue of
FELIX must arrive on or before
the Wednesday before publication.
Only the full weight of opinion
of the students concerned will
ever change this. To this end,
Harry Fairbrother (an Executive
member of the A.Sq.W.) and I,
I tv" br" '-""d a room in .tne
Museum Tavern for 19th Febru-
ary at 11 a.m. where a meeting
of interested P.G.'s (from all Col-
leges of the University) will take
place to decide on some construct-
ive action.
The cost of publicity and of
the room has been paid for by the
A.Sc.W under whose auspices the
meeting will be held, but those
who attend are under no obligat-
ion to the A.Sc.W I hope the
large number of SRC students at
IG will represented.

Save our
posters
Sir.
Last week a FELIX poster was
removed from the Mech. Eng.
stand well before FELIX was on
sale. FELIX is now having to
overprint posters in order to make
up this deficit. Would people who
want a FELIX poster please wait
at least until Wednesday evening
before stealing them from the
stand, or order them from Frank
Morris, Falmouth 122.

Conference on
lecturing
methods
Sir,
Two years ago a motion was pas-
sed at an IC Union meeting cul-
ling for an all-college conference
on teaching methods. For many
reasons, mostly the inexperience of
the committee charged with its
organisation, this was net held.
However, the problem remains.
Since that time some depart-
ments have introduced more
sophisticated courses, a language
laboratory has been set up and
amongst other things a control TV
studio with piped lectures and de-
monstrations for all parts of the
College is being planned.
If there is sufficient interest a
conference could be called later
this term. Participation of the con
stituent College Unions and the
branches of the Association of
University Teachers and the As-
sociation of Scientific Workers
would be invited. Anybody inter-
ested in assisting in the prepar-
ation for such a conference please
contact me via Chemistry (Int
2709) or Room 422 Tizard (Int
3634).

Dissent in Elect Eng
Sir,
We would like to dissociate ourselves from remarks made by "OTOLI"
in his first exposition to FELIX. We do not consider that Dr. Gundry's
lectures were a waste of time and would like to ponit out that any syllabus
grievances can be put before Guilds Academic subcommitte via the year
representative.

Du Pont-the world's largest chemical firm-is expanding
in Europe. Du Pont Company (U.K.) Ltd. is a key part of
this growth, with a major elastomer chemicals complex
already in operation and two fibres plants now being built
at its Maydown Works, Londonderry, N. Ireland.
This expansion creates opportunities for
CHEMISTS
CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS
MECHANICAL ENGINEERS
Our manufacturing processes are advanced and the posts
we offer call for a wide range of technical skills. Salary,
benefits and general conditions of service are generous and
in keeping with the best industrial practice. There may be
opportunities to visit the United States and Continental
Europe either for specialist training or to widen experience.
Representatives from Du Pont will be at the Appointments
