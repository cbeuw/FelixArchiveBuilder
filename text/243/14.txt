These are the eyes of Michael Frayn. For seven
years now, week in, week out (apart from 4
weeks' paid holiday a year), first in The
Guardian, then in The Observer, Frayn has
had to write an article. 700 words 3 times a
week for The Guardian; 900 words once a
week in The Observer.
He has also written two novels, The Tin
Men and The Russian Interpreter. Appeared
regularly on Granada TV. Wrote for TW3.
Contributed to The Age of Austerity. He is
also married, with two daughters.
Yet there is still virtually no evidence that Frayn
has been affected by this. However a growing
number of people read The Observer every
Sunday for this reason alone. To be actually
there, on hand, when he does finally — well
- snap.
Read The Observer every Sunday<§>
