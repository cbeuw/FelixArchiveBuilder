The "parking problem" in South-
side lias recently been somewhat
alleviated by the apparently dor-
mant Southside Car Parking Com-
mittee. At the beginning of term
various derelict vehicles (12 motor-
cycles and 4 cars) were disposed
of and ruither removals • vilj take
place this term.
The present parking space for
cars is still 22 places short of the
necessary 100 places, but there is
sufficient space for motor-cycles
and bicycles. The Committee hopes
that the bays and no-parking lines
will be repainted over Easter and
maka more space available.
Other matters being investigated
by the Committe include the pro-
vision of stand-pipe for car-wash-
ing and the prevention of abuse
of the facilities by non-college
members. Also recommendations
are to be made to the College
Parking Committee concerning
future plans for vehicle use in
Southside.

One of the disadvantages inherent in a society devoted to the pro-
duction of the works of one particular writer or musician is that their
choice is limited. Inevitably this leads to the occasional production of
an artist's less brilliant works and many Gilbert and Sullivan fans consider
that Ruddigore falls into this category.
It would be nice to be able to
My that the Gilbert and Sullivan
Society offset this by giving an
exoeptianially mterestfng perform-
ance, but unfortunately they
didn't. The common Imperial Col-
lege occurence of a small audience
probably didn't help the actors—
despite the steady arrival of people
throughout the first 40 minutes.
Allowing for this, though, the
general impression was that while
the singing and orchestra had
been amply rehearsed, the acting
had been left very much to look
after itself.
Engineers in the chemical industry
can fairly claim to face a wider range
of interesting problems than in any
other industry ICI is in the forefront
of the chemical industry and offers
virtually unlimited variety of opportunity in design, development, production,
research, and many forms of industrial management. ICI gives each engineer
the chance to develop his technical and managerial abilities and—
equally important—offers unlimited prospects for advancement.

Good opening
The first act opened well, with
a well sung solo part by one of
the bridesmaids, played by Mary
Macphail, and a chorus by the
village corps of permanent brides-
maids, who could at all times be
heard above the orchestra level.
The lead actors who followed im-
mediately afterwards were some-
thing of disappointment, not least
because Rose Maybud (Susan
Browne) looked somewhat older
than Dame Hannah (Catherine
Robinson).
Colin Davis seemed rather un-
happy with his part as Robin
Oakapple, and was determined to
tell the audience so, but he gave
a much more convincing perform-
ance in the Second Act as the
Bad Baronet.
Exactly why it is difficult to
say, but the whole production
warmed up enormously in the
Second Act, perhaps because this
part of the script is much more
diamatic, and amenable to over-
acting. Gilbert's many banalities,
from being merely jnfrxriating be-
came actually amusing at times
in this act, and for this much
credit is due to Mad Margaret
(Jenifer Caws) and Sir Despard
Murgatroyd (Jaclt Hopkins), whose
clear enunciation and carefully
contrbMeid un<jeractihg madb the
best of Gilbert's often vicious
ironies.
Not M e m o r a b l e
As Gilbert and Sullivan the pro-
duction was entertaining as G &
E is entertaining, but it was not
a memorable production of
Ruddigore.
