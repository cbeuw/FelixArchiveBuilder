omment
The Union is running well. Though there are many faults ana
complaints, as a whole it is carrying on well. There are Carnival,
whose haul so far approaches £2000, the Entertainments Commit-
tee, who took great pride in announcing their profit at Council
recently and FELIX itself, which shows every sign of breaking-
even, a situation which makes it almost unique amongst student
newspapers.
It is not only in these respects that there is high activity, with appeal
funds for Vietnam orphans and South African students, a lobby of Parlia-
ment and the work done on student houses, the usefulness and interest
cf Union life increases. Whatever one's views of Mr Duckett and his
idtals, his enthusiasm could well be emulated by many of those not activ-
ely engaged in die Union.
However, to return to finance, the need for success is greater this
year than ever before. When the estimates were prepared at the begin-
ning of the year it became apparent that, unless a loan of the order £1000
could be obtained from the College, the Union would run into debt by
the end of the year. The Union finance of the past two years has been
based on the expectation that the Union fee would be increased to £7
per person per year; in view of the recent remarks by Mr. Crosland at
Lancastei and elsewhere, it is entirely possible that this may not be forth-
coming. This point was made by Dr. Weale, the Senior Treasurer, to
haushed Council meeting (even Phillips was silent).
'the loan from the College has still to be settled the fee may not be
increased; no longer can the attitude that 'the Union can afford it' be
accepted.
It is a great pity that Mr Jordan, having raised the question of the
publicity given to Council proceedings, could not attend the most recent
of those famous convocations. I feel sure that he would have been im-
pressed nay, bewildered by the level of debate which takes place, from
David Reich, who always gives the impression of talking rubbish own-
when uttering the greatest common sense, to flippant Ray Phillips, who
is the anotheosis of Mr Reich. Even the present strong chair cannot pre-
vent the members chasing each other into logical cul-de-sacs off the main
road Seriously though they've doing a grand job!
The riming of this last meeting iwas such that it is possible to Include
the eve' ts of it in the main issue. I hope Mr Jordan is satisfied

IC to join R S A ?
Sir,
"Keep at them" This was die
advice of Teremy Thorpe and
other sympathetic M.P.s to 100 IC
students taking part in the
N.U.S./R.S.A. lobby of M.P.s to
gam support for the tens ot
thousands of overseas students
seriously hit by the Government's
decision to triple fees for over-
seas students (£70-£250). "you
have a very good case and s.ii'uld
win, you must not be put off by
nods of agreement and no act-
ion." said Nigel Fisher, Tory M.P
for Surbiton.
This bore out much of the
opinion of the Radical Student A l -
liance (R.S.A.), who were afraid
that N.U.S., while saying the rigi-.t
things, would tone down student
feelings on overseas studenrt fee
rises to ineffectiveness. Crosland
had eulogised N.U.S. at Margate
as a responsible, respected body
and yet had announced these in-
creases on the first day of the
Christmas Vacation without con-
sultation of N.U.S. or Universities.
This is what respect gains for you.
The plight of overseas students is
one of immediate hardship and
must be fought with all the vigour
that sympathetic students can put
into it. N.U.S.'s tactics of mini-
protests cannot be allowed to toe
us this particular case. This is not
militancy for militancy s sake, but
militancy because this is a cause
we cannot and should not lose. In
tliis spirit R.S.A. assembled an
additional 2,000 students to swell
the carefully regulated N.U.S. lob-
by to proportions lat really made
people take noticf
In view of rec t press public-
ity on R.S.A., it „eems necessary
that I declare myself not a Com-
munist. I am a Liberal and the
moment R.S.A. becomes the voice
of one faction, be it Liberal, Com-
munist or Comish National, I will
denounce it. Its council of 20 is
in fact carefully balanced between
4 each from Liberal, Communist
and Labour (non Trotskyite) and 8
Independents. Many radical Tories
have also participated. It can only
exist as long as it is unanimous,
as long as it espouses causes sup-
ported by all, the moment it
splits, it loses its point. Thus I
don't think anyone need fear a
takeover by any group, the moment
this happens the rest would de-
nounce it and the offending fact-
ion would be saddled with running

a trout organisation with no more
effect than the parent; body. At
present it is very clearly sticking
to a non-factional approach. How-
ever much the Press and N.U.S.
might tiy to "Red smear" it, the
30u htuuents from 90 colleges who
attended the inaugural convention
on Jan. 28th/29th know how firm-
ly it was put on this path. Of
course it is political and radical,
it strives for change, towards an
ideal of freedom and justice in
Education and Student life, but it
is not partisan. When it becomes
partisan it dies.
R.S.A. exists to work within
N.U.S., to save N.U.S. from itself.
Most of all, it provides what
N.U.S. stifles, a grass-roots voice,
a platform for anyone with some-
thing worth saying and with
enough support. Its strength is in
unanimity and the number of
students supporting it. When an
issue such as student loans comes
up that IC has supported, it must
throw its weight in with R.S.A.
and others who feel as strongly
about it. By covering our eyes and
dissociating ourselves from
R.S.A., we will ensure that it be-
comes what we all fear, unrepre-
sentative, unsympathetic and in-
effective , another N.U.S.
Of course IC must decide on
its own, what its attitude to issues
is, but once it has, let it strive
with all of a similar opinion to
make its views count.

Sir,
Our society came in for a great
deal of criticism and bad report-
ing in your last issue. The latter
was prevalent both in "That Ex-
hibition" and "demagogic CND".
This was obviously not deliberate
but has led to some of our remarks
being interpreted in totally the
wrong way.
May I first of all answer the
criticism levelled at the Vietnam
photographic exhibition,. We ac-
cept entirely the opinion that this
exhibition was heavily anti-
American biased. We, as a society,
believe the U.S. forces are in
Vietnam illegally, a view shared
by U Thant, and therefore can
separate the victim from the ag-
gressor. I do admit, however, that
I personally did not completely
agree with the exhibition. I" cart-
cont accept the glorific-
ation of war but in the main I
am sympathetic to the N.L.F and
can justify their fighting. We did
at first make it clear that this ex-
hibition was designed by the
Bertradl Russell Pjeace Foundation
but were ordered by the College
authorities to remove all reference
to them.
The reason we put up such an
openly biased display was because
this would cause the controversy
we wanted. In the past, taking a
more neutral attitude, at great
cost to our own consciences, we
have not been able to stir this
Union away from its sluggish
apathy. During our display I have
heard more discussion on the
Vietnam War than I have heard
before at this college. We will be,
following this up with discussions
