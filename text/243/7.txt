FELIX 7
This House was Speed-Crazy
Faster than 70m.p.h?
Graham Hill proposing the motion declared that the Ministry of Trans-
port's limit was not constructive but destructive. Motoring as a means
of transport could never progress if it was restricted; speed restrictions
did not necessarily increase safety; in fact, the bunching of cars travelling
at the same speed created danger. Speed limits of 65 to 70 mph in
America had produced cars with impossible handling : power brakes and
steering made them too insensitive for anything but parking. Moreover,
speed limits varied from state to state; there was no agreed best speed.
The French had the best syst square ot the speed. The Americ-
em: there is no speed limit, but
police keep a close watch on traf-
fic dangers. The answer to the
Jsafety problem is better driver
education—the 70 mph speed
limit was like 'the man with the
red flag who walked in front of
early cars.'
Against the motion. Professor
Buchanan proposed the "rule of
reason' Mr Hill's argument was
appealing but emotional. Auto-
mobilies were a good idea, but
caused terrible accidents, and
short of rebuilding all our roads
and ensuring that everybody
drove perfectly, we could only ex-
ercise care and self-discipline. The
30 mph limit in towns had de-
creased the accident rate. Since
motorways were designed for 70
mph ;iO-one could complain that
the speed limit was unfair, and
uniformity of behaviour on t'^em
was safer since at 70 mph a driv-
er covered 200 feet before he
could react to danger. Moreover,
the energy dissipated in an ac-
cident was proportional to the
an situation was better than ours.
Seconding the motion, Tony
Duke quoted statistics showing
that speed limits did not reduce
accidents. For example, 76 people
were killed on the roads at
Christmas in 1965, and 102 in
1966. The Road Research Labor-
atory had concluded that the 30
mph limit in towns did some
good, but adminjjstrabVfci costs
were out of all proportion to the
results. The individual driver
should limit his speed to the con-
ditions and to his skill.
Brendan Parker, opposing, said
that drink propably affected the
Christmas accident rate, but the
speed limit did not. Expert driv-
ers might be able to drive fast
safely, but how many cars were
safe at 70 mph?
Points from the floor included:
'Why should we all be restricted to
the same speed?" and 'Why should
people die for the enjoyment of
others?" Advisory speed limits
were proposed, as well as the
idea that drivers should he tested
as to their maximum safe speed.
Professor Buchanan concluded
that the argument that speed lim-
its were unenforceable was ridio-
ulsous. Since motorway:, were de-
signed for a certain speed, this
limit should be enforced. The
fact that tnere was a law against
murder in this country and that
this was broken was not a valid
reason for doing away with the.
law.
This produced tha retort from
Graham Hill that the reason thai
the law against murder was unen-
forceable was that the police
were too busy chasing motorists.
The vote : 145 for, 103 against,
13 abstantions.
UNION:
Associate
Membership
The membership of IC clubs
is now to be open to non
Union members. This was the
outcome of a long discussion
at the last Council Meeting.
There was much discussion
about the report of the Com-
mitee which originally con-
sdered the problem of As-
sociate Membership; this was
centred on the economics and
who should decide upon the
eligibility of applicants. It
was eventually agreed that it
was unnecessary to limit ap-
plications to members of ap-
proved organisations as the
number of people involved
would not be large.
Economics
The use of the phrase "econom-
ic subscription" caused some con-
cern to be expressed by some
members of Council; most of hem
recognised the inadvisability ot
subsidising Associate members at
the expense of others but were
stil not satisfied. The difficulty was
ultimately resolved when Frank
Fuchs was inspired to give Counc-
il an Economic Lesson. When he
pointed out that "economic" im-
plied availability and desirability
ah well as financial considerations,
the original phrasing of this pa -t
of the report was allowed to stand.
The version of the report that
was passed allows clubs who want
associate members to apply to
their Clubs Committee which will
u»e its discretion about who to
admit an'' how much to charge.
When asked by Frank Fuch< if
a letter about this dec'iinri would
be sent to various institutions,
Tony Duke said that he felt it
was not necessary to advertise for
members. There were people who
had already enquired about ioining
clubs and these would now be ad-
mitte,
