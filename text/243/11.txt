is in a rut...
so we won't insult yojur intelligence with yet another
reshuffle of cliches. Here are the facts:
We are among the largest producers of petroleum chemicals
in Europe, and are jointly owned by the BP and Distillers
Groups. We are big, but not so big as to have lost the
personal touch. Our two factories (£60 millions-worth) are
at Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, and Baglan Bay, Glamorgan.
Both have all the charm of a Martian space station;
but the surroundings offer some of the finest scenery ^nd
amenities to be found anywhere. See your travel agent!
We pay no better than other top companies - initially. But
this should interest you: we are embarked on a continuous
expansion programme which enables us to give early
responsibility to junior staff.
If you have - or hope to have - an honours degree in one
of the undermentioned disciplines, we should like to give
you the whole story at an early interview. Write briefly to

"Hello out there"
Guilds' entries
for the Bristol
races
For several days now intrepid
Guildsman have been living with
death, (in the form of lorry leads
of mud) in Imperial Institute
Road. Early last week they were
to be seen speeding around
Prince's Gardens, legs pumping
furiously, but one august gentler-
man, well loved in Southside, ob-
jected to the risk of his dog being
run over by a pedal car-
of the day several ot the more
energetic members ot Guilds
Union are to be seen dodging cars,
people and post boy s " bikes, in
front of R.C.S.' Chemistry Build-
ing.
Superior car
The purpose of these activities
has been to produce a team of fit
men to enter the National 24
Hour Pedal Car Race on March
3/4 at Bristol. The team has been
training on a pedal car which, it
is claimed, is slightly superior to
R.C.S. s entry, so that they will be
able to do remarkably well on the
imp-oved models at present being
constructed under the direction of
Phil Marshall in Mech Eng.
Secret design
The design of the pedal cars is
being kept a very close secret, but
it is no secret that one of the cars
will be an improved, convent-
ional design and one is stated to
be revolutionary. Despite its
strange design the revolutionary
model is said to be quite legal and
should stand a very good chance
at Bristol.

"Hello out there" is the Dramat-
ic Society's entry for the U L U one
act play contest. Their first public
performance was given recently at
IC; it was given a good start by
the excellent scenery designed and
built by Nigel Nettleship, and
this start was taken up well by
Rav Croft and Helen RuH<re to
make this a memorable half-hour.
The play, written by Wilbam
Saroyan told of the last few
hours of a man in jail accus-
ed of raping a local girl. By its
nature the plav was slow but un-
der the able direction of producer
Geoff Keyte it was nevr allowed
to drag and without a filter it built
up to the final climax. For the
final scenes the principals were
joined by John Spence, and two
other members of the lynching
party with Lesley Wheeler as the
local slut.
The actual contes* took place
on 9 February at U L U .

Newspapers
stopped in
Tizard
Tizaid Residents1
' Committee
stopped the newspapers provid-
ed in the Hall during last
week. The intention was to make
the residents realise that the Com-
mittee takes a serious view of the
removal of newspapers from the
Gallery Area.
It costs about £50 a year to
provide the newspapers, this money
comes from a 5/- fee paid by
each resident. At present only a
few with no 'social conscience
benefit from this service and the
committee feels that the way
these few systematically steal the
communal papers is intolerable.
When the papers are resumed
they will be stamped with Tizard
stamp before release and anyone
who removes them from the
Tizard Hall gallery will be liable
to be brought before the Disciplin-
ary Committee. A letter has been
circulated to all residents inform-
ing them of these decisions.
