Progress on Student
Houses
Report to C o u n c i l
The Union has taken a second step towards the formation of Student
Houses. In a detailed report nresentH by Pet° F-'rt'-h to Union Council,
the sources of finance, an estimate of typical furnishing and running ex-
penses and suitable currently available leases are given. The report,
which had been given only a brief reading by the members, has been ac-
cepted with few reservations.
Most discussion centres on the fundamental problem of finance. T m
report suggests that the best source would probably be industry and. that
the old students associations could be of great help with this. Chris Molam
noted that the Old Centralians had been keen a number of yeafs ago to
build a hall for Guildsmen. This brought the objection that a- single-Col-
lege hall might be unpopular, though any increase in accomodation would
be useful. The essential is that any money obtained should be without
strings, the proposal to have the College run the appeal was changed to
one in which it was merely sponsoied by the College.
The old students' representatives showed their value in their concern
over the legal aspect* and offered to assist.
The estimates are based on an lease for six months, and thus
initial plan for fifteen bedrooms
with two common rooms, and vary
from £2300 to £3000 p.a. This
covers heat, lighting, water,
laundry, repairs and maintenance,
insurance and cleaners wages but
no rates (the Union does not pay
rates). The cost is then between
£2-7 0 and £2-17-6 per person
per week. It is hoped to econom-
ise on redecoration by getting
students to do the unskilled parts.
Rents would be charged over
the Christmas and Easter vacations,
but it might be possible to sub-
let rooms during the summer.
However, this type of house would
come under the laws which can
give compulsory extensions of
squatters could be a problem.
The report proposed to restrict
occupancy to men only but
Council seemed to thi.'lc that a
'multi-sexual' house would be pos-
sible.
Six suitable properties are listed
in the report ranging from £27.000
to £82,000 with a large variation
in the amount and tyne of ar-
comodation available. They are all
in the borough of Kensington and
lie between a ouarter and one
mile fom the College.
Council set up a com^'^ee to
work on the Problem wVrh >

Folk Club
Success
John Renboum

The last Folk Song Club con-
cert, entitled "Bert and John",
was a sell-out with at least three
hundred eagerly straining for a
view, and certainly lived up to ex-
pectations. Renboume came on
alone, after the '"New Lost City
Ramblers" had opened the pro-
gramme, and with a cigarette semi-
permanently between his lips, play-
ed fcr half an hour. His style was
similar to that of Jansch, equallly
intricate and involved, with a
wide range, from gentle iolk
melody to a jazz tinged instru-
menlal. Jansch was even better.
As iiu entertainer hi., preseuation
was not perfect. He tended to
wander fi n song to song, cut
numbers short, sing too quietly,
and had to play into a microphone
that went dead twice. None of this
had anv effect on his performance
—Jansch seems to play for him-
self, only noticing the audience*
between numberi; this is probably
the reason for his tremendous stage
presence.
MIKE due to return from UC
Sir,
By the rime this letter appears in FELIX, the College mascot—
MIKE—which was removed from the Union by U.C. on December
8th. last, will almost certainly be back in our possession—see Late
Ne\>s sheet. Some of your readers will probably know that the
Wooden Horse Organisation were set a trail of clues which, when
solved, would lead to MIKE's safe return. This trail has now
been successfully followed.
A letter arrived during the clue was still there we found it

loved mascot again, one—and "Go flat-hunting in Tufnell
only one—of us was to go to the Parn" was the next clue. The next
next U.C. Union General Meet- message was found in a news-
ing where Ashley Hill, their pre- agent'se window near Tufnell
sident, would present us with the P a r k
Tube Station and read:—

^ the last clue would arrive on
Dicks pub in Bishopsgate.
On the back of this card were
the words :—
"Look for my colleague Mr.
Dutton—be also hangs about in
here "
This proved to be another visit-
ing card located among mat1
;
others just over the bar.
The reverse side of this one
bore J —
"S.W 385252, Ask for Brian.'
The letter and digit combinat-
ion is the Ordnance Survey map
reference for Bosfranken Farm in
Cornwall—just a stone's throw
from Land's End. Luckily we
managed to persuade a resident of
Cornwall, a Mr Bolton, to pop
across and collect the clue for
us. It appears that "Brian", a
brother of one of the U.C. Ex-
ecutive, demanded half a gallon
of beer in return for the clue.
Mr Bolton has since refused to
ev6n consider allowing W.H.O. to
reimburse him.
The clue Mr Bolton collected
was :—
"RM 731 is the custodian of
your next clue."
This is a bus based at Edmont-
on L.T. garage and after one
fruitless search through it and re-
assurances from Pook that the
the morning of Saturday the 11th.
This consisted of a letter to
Wooden Horse and an envelope
containing ten pieces of magnetic
recording tape—each roughly one
inch long.
After ascertaining that the tape
bad been recorded at a slower
speed than 3 3/4 i.p.s. and on all
four tracks we set off to borrow
a 4-track, multi-speed tape record-
er for the afternoon.
However, none was forthcoming
in IC so we had to go to Eearl's
Court wficie four of us spent a
pleasant, if tedious, four hours
working out the sequence until
we ai rived at the final message
which told us the time and place
where MIKE would be handed
over."
Anyway, we met Pook on Sun-
day night and also the person
who used the oxy-acetylene. Ap-
parently the heat conduction along
along MIKE was so efficient that
there is not even a mark on the
micrometer—but we shall know
this for certain very soon.
As a final note for those intent
on revenge-—the compliment can-
not yet be returned since Phineas
will not be in residence until their
new Union building is finished in
at least six month's time.
