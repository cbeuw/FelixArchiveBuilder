Possibility of a strike
Everyone most now be aware oi the intention of the Govern-
ment to triple the fees of all students from anywhere but Britain
and Northern Ireland,—this increase from £70 now to what is de-
scribed as the economic figure of £250—will take effect from next
session.

While the uproar over overseas
students' tees grows, and LSE
Union shouts itself 'go pieces, a
different, but more dramatic form
of student activity is taking place
on our very doorstep. The Libyan
Embassy, midway between South-
side and the Mech. Eng. building,
was on Monday She 6th largely
over-run by Libyan students from
universities all over the U.K.
Banners stating their demands
were put up outside the Embassy,
to signify the start of a sit-down
strike. The banners have since
been removed, but the students
are still clustered in the gloom .of
the Embassy Hall. At the time of
writing the situation is that the
Libyan Government has cancel-
led the students grants, and that
the sit-down strike has become a
hunger strike with Mr Bashir, its
leader, firmly committed to a
showdown. IC is not represented.
From what one can gather the
Libyan Government has been
violetnly opposed to the Libypn
students' Union for a long time.
Students have been detained, re-
fused grants and teaching facilit-
ies, even wounded and killed in
what the publicitv handout de-
scribes as a peaceful demonstrat-
ion' The present .strike is part of
campaign to force their Government
campaign to force Government
into a more tolerant and reason-
able attitude.

The concern of the Union Ex-
ecutive for the effect that this
change would have on the ability
of students from poor countries
^or underpriviledged classes in the
more wealthy ones) to benefit from
our highly developed higher educ-
ational system, was expressed in
the motion read by Brendan
Parker. Subsequently the meeting
decided to send the delegates on
the NUS sponsored lobby on the
1st February. Presumably the
idea was to have one student
lobbyist for 1000 members up to
a total of 200. The participation
of our three delegates (myself,
Derek Boothman and Nitim Som)
was not accepted but some com-
plimentary tickets to the NUS
protest meeting were supplied. At
the meeting a number of MPs and
prominent academics indicated
disagreement with this particular
Cabinet gem. The general con-
census was that the £5m saved
(the sole official reason for the
change) would easily have been
saved on some other item of
Government expediture.
R S A Triumph
So much for NUS; it so hap-
pens that the Radical Students
Alliance won the day by calling
for a mass student lobby of
Parliament on the same day. The
three official delegates and about
100 other IC students joined this
lobby and waited for hours out
in the cold for the Parliamentary
process to accommodate them.
The queue outside the House
was the longest I've ever seen
and I'm sure most of the students
never got into the lobby.
However, well over 150 MPs
were seen most of whom agreed
with our point of view and many
Were annoyed that the change in

policy was not discussed in the

tempting to get the matter dis-
cussed.
R C S S t r i k e ?
Under the terms ot the motion
passed by die Union the Execut-
ive Committee is charged to
pursue further action if this is
necessary. The Radical Students
Alliance (in the absence of a lead
from NUS) has designated
February 22nd. as a Day of act-
ion' Ideas so far are: a strike—
.vhich Keele University will cettdr-
lv support; a telephone 'siege of
the Department of Education &
Science by affected students and
others pressing for information;
RCS Union is discussing with the
Dean the possibility of a token
suspension of the lrst lecture on
Wednesday, February 2^,nd.;
>etitions; individual letters iu
MPs; etc.

In a recent interview, Union
President Tony Duke said that
he strongly opposed Mr. Frank
Fuch's suggestion at the last
Council meeting that students at
IC should hold a one day stop-
page on February 22nd (the RSA
day of protest) in support of the
overseas students' fight against
fee increases. He said he had
the support of the Union Execut-
ive in the matter and the opinion
of Council was that sufficient act-
ion was being taken already and
a one day stoppage would only
unnecessarily prejudice staff-stud-
ent relations.
S i r Owen not
worried
Tony JDuke also mentioned
that he had spoken to the Acting
Rector, Sir Owen Saunders about
the stoppage and, although Sir
Owen was not in favour of it, he
had said it would not unduly
worry him if students decided to
stage a strike.
Thus there will be no stoppage
unless Frank Fuchs raises a
motion at the Union meeting on
February 21st and in this case
the President himself will oppose
the motion.
