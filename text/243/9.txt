FELIX
PROF.ABDUS SALAM
A n I n t e r n a t i o n a l
by MARTIN WALKER
From a distance Abdus Salam is a small Pakistani gentleman
with a moustache. But this appearance is deceptive. His secret-
ary's attitude towards him varies from a mixture of respect and
wonder to stark terror. " All I can say," she says, "is that he's
a man of the world." She refers to him, in his absence, as
"Father". There is clearly much more to the man than meets
the eye.
A glance in Who's Who gives
part of the answer. He is a Fellow
of the Royal Society, Science Ad-
visor to the President of Pakistan,
and a member of the United
Nations Advisory Commit^e on
Science and Technology. He was
educated at Government College,
Lahore, Pakistan, where he took
an M.A. in mathematics. He also
has a B.A. and PhD from
Cambridge, where he was a fel-
low of St. John's College, and
worked under Professor Kemmer.
He has made 'contributions to the
theory of elementary particles,'
and has received an honorary de-
gree and several prizes for physics.
He is a member of the Athenaeum
Club.
When I intaTTvSew'ed him, 'he
was relaxed and talked easily with
a sense of humour, leaning back
in his chair with his hands clasped
in front of him. He appeared
pleasant and easy going, but gave
the inescapable impression that in-
efficiency or inaccuracy would in-
furiate him. While we talked,
the telephone rang. T rang
earlier,' he said. 'You'd better
check with your message service.
They don't seem to be doing
their iob.' He rang off.
The atmosphere in physics at
Cambridge in 1947 was very ex-
citing. The discovery or II—mesons
in cosmic Ways had confirmsd
Yukawa's prediction of their ex-
istence a dozen years earlier, and
opened up hitherto undreomedi-of
avenues of research. Salam was
doing part II of the mathematics
tripos at Cambridge when the dis-
covery was made. Both Professor
F Hoyle, and his tutor, a gee1
K-
ist, urged him co taKe the physi'-s
tripos, though for different reas-
ons. His tutor wanted to see if
someone with a first in matherrfat-
ics could do the physics tripos in
one year: Salam could, and did.
He desribes that year as verv
difficult: T hae neer worked so
hard, before or since.' He con-
fessed to finding the experimetal
work particularly tough anu inlt
that he didn't hae the aptitude for
it. But the desire 'to be able to
look a 'real physicist' in the eye'
helped him to persevere and to
obtain a first in physics.
People with first in physics did
experimental research and Salam
was duly assigned a problem to
do with alpha-particle scattering
from tritium. But he disliked hav-
ing his work depend on the whims
of a technician, or on an act of
God. An experimental physicist
must be patient; Salam is not.
When he lea"-ned that it would
F i g u r e —
take months for a supnly cf fcrf*-
ium to arrive from th" United
States, he asked to be allowed to
work in theoreticaL physics,, some-
thing which at that time in the
Cavendish was reserved for stud-
ents with only seconds or thirds in
the physics tripos! So, l'n 1950
at the age of 25, he began re-
search on meson theory under
Professor Kemmer.
Physics has been Salam's major
interest in life. He was attracted
by the desire to understand, but
mainly by the excitement of
elementary particle physics. How-
ever he also reads a good deal of
economics and enjoys oriental music.
He has worked hard for Pakistan
in the fields of scientific admin-
istration and science teaching
To what aim is the work in
this department directed ?
... Salam replied : "To the elucid-
ation of the fundamental laws of
nature."
This sounds very vague but a
little thought will convince the
reader that there was no need to
expand on Salam's reply to the
question. Theoretical physics is
that simple—and that complicat-
ed.
It has been suggested that
theoretical physics has be-
come a mathematical game de-
an d indeed some mathematicians
probably approach theoretical
physics: ifci trihif. way,i—but hot
Salam. He and Professor Matthews
look at mathematics from a prag-
matic ooint of view; it is a too'
to aid in the formulation of
physical problems and in getting
answers. 'We construct the maths
we use as we need it to under-
stand the physics.'
What is the role of theoretic-
al physics ?
'I came across a good quotat-
ion on that the other day," he
said, rummaging among some
papers, "but my secretary must
have taken it away. It goes some-
thing like this: "Surely this is a
great part of our dignity as men,
that we can know and that
through us matter can know itself;
that beginning with protons and
electrons, out of the womb of
time and vastness of space, 'we
can begin to udersland; that
organised as in us, the hydrogen,
tire carbon, the nitrogen, the
oxygen, those 16 to 20 elements,
the water, the sunlight, all having
become us, can begin to under-
stand what they are and how
they came to be."
He had obviously been attack-
ed before on the question of
what, if any, use was research in-
to elementary particles. He ad-
mits that, except for those in
cosmic rays, elementary particles
are purely man's construction.
This week FELIX
starts a new series of art-
icles looking into the lives
of some outstanding per-
sonalities on the IC camp-
us. In this, the first article,
Martin Walker talks to a
figure he admires, a man
of wide international re-
nown, Professor Abdus
Salam who shares the chair
of Theoretical Physics with
Professor Matthews.
void of physical content or
significance. Do
Salam did not agree. 'This', he
said, 'is nonsense!'
He went on to qualifv: some ex-
perimental physicists talk this way,
They just don't exist naturally.
He joked: "There are only
thirteen omega-minuses in the
universe—and we made them
all. But who knows ? Later on
they may make bombs out r.l
omega-minuses! But this is non-
sense of course." He laughed.
Do you envisage any great
steps forward, of the order of
Einstein's Special Theory of
Relativity say, in the neir
future ?
Here he was on comfortable
ground. "Relativistic quantum
mechanics is right," he said, win,
an air of futility, but a lot of work
has yet to be done." Salam c
visages no dramatic breakthroughs
during the next twenty years,
partly because in elementary part-
icle physics we must wait for
machines that will enable us to
probe distances shorter than ten
to the minus thirteen cm. in mat
ter, and partly because, as he
said "great breaktroughs are a one
in a century thing. We've already
had relativity and quantum mech-
anics in the twentieth century."
Do you think that there is
any limit to what we can kow
about nature?
"Physics will never stop giving
us surprises. But whether the sur-
prise comes at ten to the minus
sixteen cm. or ten to the minus
eighteen cm.—who can sayr"' He
went on to say that we will st
oo
doing physics only when "for
some reason we can no longer do
experiments." He gave general re-
lativity as an example. Physicists
lost interest in a theory of gravit-
ation when it had been shown
Einstein's theory satisfied the
'three cosmological tests' No
other experimental check on the
theory was possible, and hence no.
progress was possible. What good
is a theory if it cannot be checked
against nature? But, as he pointed
out, adances in technology—for
example, satellites,—.could give
rise to new experiments and re-
vive interest in relativity.
"Intrinsically," he said, "we
can go on indefinitely—some-
where or other, a breakthrough
will occur. But elementary part-
icle physics may die for practical
reasons, because the cost of
machmes to probe to shorter dis-
tances becomes prohibitive. Of
course someone may come up
with an idea—for a superconduct-
ing accelerator of some kind say
— which will allow us to get tc
very high energies for only a few
thousand pounds."
Do you consider it necessary
to justify the high cost of re-
search in high energy physics?
"Knowledge is worth whatever
it costs to aquire it." Here he be-
