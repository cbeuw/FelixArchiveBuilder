The Government debac :
?
over the overseas studen's'
fees increase continues to be
hotly debated throughout th?
country. It is ripht that it
should be. It is essential that
the pressure of protest be mi;
i-
tanned until the Government
resolve is reversed. Seldom in
our modern and supposedly
enlightened community has
there been a more hypocritical
and callous action, for the de-
cision is not only a wrong and
poor one for Britain, it is an
immoral one, particularly so
for being made by a Socialist
Government
What then are the factors in-
volved in this startling determin-
ation; factors which one assumes
Mr. Crosland has considered? One
that he undoubtedly considered,
nudged from behind by the
Treasury, is the saving in foreign
currency—estimated at £5 million.
The Government has since stated
that the extra fees from overseas
students from the under-develop-
ed countries will be reimbursed
to their respective countries. The
saving is therefore even less. For
this saving, partly indeed com-
pared with, say, the total expend-
iture on education—£177 million
—or, say, the defence bill—
£2095 million—the Government
is prepared to snuff out in mid-
stream the University or College
career* ol numerous students now
in Britain. Th.p«e are the students
supporting themselves, or support-
ed by private means, many of
whom will be unable, onite un-
able, just to gather the extra
monev required. After spending
in time, one, two, or more
years, in expenditure, money that
they could probably ill-afford, and
in effort, innumerable hours of
energy, concentration and worry,
thfy must now return to their
countries with nothing in return,
except perhaps bitterness.
This, then, for them is quite
jimply a breach of faith. It is as

if a housewife had contracted to

to take it away if the increase i:>
not paid.
There are too the man/ stud-
ents in the future who will now
not have the opportunity of an
advanced education hero, and it
is this factor above all which
seems to have been callously
ignored. There are of course those
parochial and purblind individuals
who will say "Whv should we, in
these islands, support the educat-
ion of people from far countries,
countries which sometimes malinn
us ?" An answer can be given in
purely mercenary terms. Britain
will benefit immeasurably, though
indirectly, on her investment. The
impact of British ideas and the
British way of life on the develop-
ing minds of foreign students here
must inevitably be vast and t^eir
actions, their decisions, as they be-
come leaders in their communit-
ies will be coloured by their ex-
perience. Britain will reap event-
ual rewards for the goodwill
giv>n
But the real answer is far deep-
er and far more important. It lies
in our capacity as human beings
to feel; in our social conscience,
" i r as John Donne has said:
'No man is an island entire of
himself. If a clod be washed from
Europe, Europe is the lesse..."
In Britain we are well aware of
this. We have a well-developed
sense of the community. But why
is this social conscience or com-
munity awareness confined merely
to those within the geographical
boundaries of Great Britain, and
bv

not extended to the world com-
munity, to the whole of mankind?
To misquote Gertrude Stein, a
man is a man is a man—the same
whether he comes from Steeple
Bumpstead in the World, Rio de
Janeiro or Shanghai. Just as we
in Britain make a community de-
cision to support each other so we
should extend this resolve to the
world community.
When on a moming in Aberfan
a mine dump falls and slays 116
children, it is not only the moth-
ers, fathers and brothers of the
children who sutler, it is not only
the people of Abcrfan who suffer,
nor the people of Wales, but the
people throughout the country feel
the disaster and rush with aid by
word and deed to try and fill the
gap. But we soem incapable of
extending this awareness one step
further—to the whole of human-
ity including those beyond our
islands. We seem to be emotion-
ally insensible to the fate of
hundreds of children dying daily
in Africa and Asia from callous
starvation. We save a fund of
£1,600,000 for the people of
Aberfan but in a given day send
a fraction of this for I'he children
of Africa, Asia and South America
It is this lack of awareness of
the whole community ( of mankind
which is reflected so sadly in the
Governments decision to increase
overseas students' fees. While the
country taxes itself according to
the means of each individual, we
as a rich 1
ition are not prepared
to tax ourselves for the individuals
beyond our boundaries. The
amount of overseas government
grant aid in 1965 was £110 mil-
lion (compare with Gross National
Product—£30,900 eq. million—or
Government Income 'eq.—£14,000
million.)
It is not only capital, however

ledge, technology and li amirrg.
While" we hide smugly as a nation
behind (in the words of the new-
Beatles' song) our "privet-hedge"
mentality, while politicians squab-
ble, the world knows how to pro-
duce more, how to grow more.
Thus though we are not affluent
on the American scale, what we
can provide above all is know-
ledge, energy and "know-how"
And one of the best ways of pro-
viding this—at a small cost to
ourselves—is through teaching and
education. We should be thinking
of taking in more overseas stud-
ents, not eliminating them.
Hence this decision is not only
misguided, it is immoral; immoral
for the malaise, the indifference
it shows to the world outside.
This is all the more cruel for it
being the action of a Socialist
Government which purports to
have a sense of the community.
It is worse still for it appears to
be politically expedient. The
Government must cut foreign ex-
penditure to balance payments.
This is accepted. If this cut had
been made in some other area
(for example a further defence
cut) the average voter might well
complain. The average voter has
not complained about the overseas
students' fees increase. Few votes
have been lost. The outcry has
come only from the academic
world I
Is IC protesting vigorously
enough ? We as a College are af-
fected more than most, for the
proportion of overseas students at
IC is one of the highest in the
country. Where are our elected
leaders now, our presidents, our
vice-presidents, our secretaries and
the whole top-heavy structure of
student representation ? Here they
have a real obstacle to overcome.
It is a worthwhile, nay necessary
action to protest strongly now,
rather than organising the darts
plaving in the Union bar, or
quibbling over the price of the
next hop tickets. What are we
going to do ? A petition is being
sent round for signatures. Let -s
get the maximum number of sign-
atures on it. We can, too, join in
the national absence from tutor-
ials and lectures on February
22nd.

It has been said that man's
social development hasn't
nearly kept up with his techno-
logical development. How do
you feel about this problem?
His reaction to this question re-
vealed the hunmnAtariknism that
is often associated in the public
mind with many scientists. He
began by saying that I must un-
derstand that his is the point of
viw of an Easterner looking at
Western society and not Undelr-.
standing how its wealth and power
can be so misused, or not used
at all. With all the resources we
have at hand how can there be
so much poverty and starvation in
the world today? Even the West-
ern countries have economic re-
cessions and: "This is absurd.
The world is crying out for know-
ledge, and goods, and we can
give them these. Why isn't world
productivity geared to making
everyone happy?"
He made the acute observation
that social consciousess has risen
to the point in England that,
if there is gross unemployment in
Wales, the English will get excit-
ed about it. But if thousands are
starving 1
,
1 Thailand? "Why does
everyone think small?" he asks.
Where is a global conscience?
Do you think it is the res-
ponsibility of scientists to
teach politicians to appreciate
the technological resources
that thev have to relieve suffer-
ing and to distribute goods
and knowledge ?
"Hell no," he said, "it is the
responsibility of scientists them-
selves to run the machine. Plato
realized this,—what is it? World
order will not come until ~Mlo-
sophers are kings and kin; are
philosophers.'
He went on to talk about tne
dfsadvantages of a scientist. The
trouble is that he seldom has the
opportunity for making big de-
cisions. But this Salam feels is
more a lack of experience than
anything else, and is easilv cured
Once faced with the Problem of
having to bt a statesman to take
decisions,—a scientist could soon
lose his narrowness and become a
competent lead sr.
He suggested that more people
with scientific training should
go into the civil service
and the administrative end of in
dustry. He quotes the case of
France's rapid economic resurg-
ence after the second World War
one reason for its speed and ef-
fectiveness was that there were
and are, scientists and technolog-
ists at the ton, many of t'lem
graduates of the Polytechnique in
Paris. The Polytechnique was found-
ed by Napoleon to train military
engineers, but many now go into
the civil service and industry.
These scientifically trained men
foim the backbone of France's de-
velopment.
"Imperial College should con-
sciously develooe this role in
Britain", be said. We should en-
courage people from IC to eet in-
to position of responsibility,
not to get buried in govern-
ment research laboratories. An-
other example ot a technologic-
al institute that b"s npf^nal <"-
fluence, and on which IC could
well be modelled, is the Massa-
chusetts Institute of" Techuoloffv
M.I.T. men have a loud voice in
Washington, but Imperial Collefe
is hardly mentioned in Sampson's
Anatomy of Britain—an analvsis
of the power structure -in Britain
today. "Have you heard of it? No?
You should read it." The people
who run Britain are the R A's
from Oxbridge.
There were no more questions,
and he stood up smiling. We
shook hands, and I walked out
past the colourful screen he has
between his desk and the door.
