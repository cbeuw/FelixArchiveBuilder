Report by the
University of London
Youth Council
For the past seven years, the University of London Youth
Council has been carrying out an experiment in Human Relat-
ionships. The object of this experiment has been simply to en-
courage students to spend part of their spare time meeting and
helping other young people in London who normally have grown
up in a very different environment. Because of the advantages
which a student will often have over the average London youngster,
it is felt that there is much that he or she can do within the con-
text of the Youth Serice, to share his or her enthusiasm for life
with these young people, while at the same time reaping a harvest
of benefit from the experiences to be gathered along the way.
Imperial moves in
About twelve months ago, a small committee was set up in Im-
perial, as a sub-committee of O.S.S., to investigate openings for
IC students to further Youth Council projects in the South West
London area. As this was the first time that students in this
area had been involved in the Scheme, it was at first necessary to
examthe the scope for involvement. Somewhat to the surprise
of the Committee, it was soon discovered that, behind the Regency
facade of Sloane Square and South Kensington a mere 4d. bus
ride from the College, there existed two Youth Clubs which were
in desperate need of help.

Any illusions which mem-
bers of the Imperial College
Youth Council had previously
held about Youth Clubs and
Youth Work were immediately
shattered on first entering the
'Off the Record' Club. "This
Club", reports Paul Shevlin,
Youth Council member, "meets
in a dimly-lit basement. The
Clubroom has a coffee bar at
one end and, on a raised floor,
a table tennis table at the
other, the rest of the room
being taken up by half a dozen
or so girls dancing, while their
boy friends and others look
on. Many sit, relaxed, chatting
and drinking coffee. This is
not to say that there is no pur-
pose in the Chib: far from it.
Although few members involve
themselves in especially creat-
ive activities, there is an in-
formal atmosphere which is
both pleasant and worthwhile,
it is also true to say that the
members respect the authority
of the leader.
Not a
take - over bid
The students who are at
present visiting the 'Off the
Record' Club feel strongly that
their reason for going there is
not so much to organise the
members into creative activit-
ies but rather to get to know
them as friends. Although the
student is older that the aver-
age Club member, he has
much in common with him. Al-
though often products of dif-
ferent environments, they
share a common culture, and
by getting to know each other
they will be making an im-
mense and very necessary con-
tribution to breaking down the
last remains of the social bar-
riers of our society. It can al-
ready be seen that the achieve-
ments which students at the
'Off the Record' are beginning
Meeting at Off the Record
\
to make, far from stemming
from an old fashioned mode
of 'do-gooding', owe their
origin to nothing more com-
plicated than a mere desire to
broaden their own outlooks
and those of some of London's
young people.
Saints
&Sinners
St. Philip's Youth Club in
Earl's Court Road offers a
vivid contrast to the 'Off the
Record' Ciub. Richard Jeifery,
of IC sums up the atmosphere
as follows: "The Club meets
in a Church hall, but is in no
way a Church Club. Member-
ship is open to all, as is only
too obvious on looking round
at those who attend. The
facilities are adequate without
being exceptional. Tab^-tennis
is taken very seriously, and
there is coaching for this every
week. The record-player plavs
an important part in the life
of the Club, but it does not
take so prominent a place as
ii does at the 'Off the Record'.
The dart-board, which is on
the stage, is used by a large
number of members every
night. There is a T.V. room,
which also serves as the vestry
to the Church. The coffee bar
does a good trade. The noise
in the Club is deafening at all
times, ^specially in the Entrance
Hall, where an extension to
the record-player enters into
open battle with the shouts of
young people comins and co-
ing, drifting in and drifting
out. In recent months there
has been a certain amount of
trouble in the Club, with some
members on druigs. The new
Club Leader has had wide ex-
perience with drug addicts and
drug addiction in general, and
is anxious to quash this pro-
blem as soon as possible. The
Club thus- provides opportun-
ities for both students with in-
terests in indoor games and
for students interested in heh>-
ing members overcome their
attachment to drugs, as we"
as for the student who iust
wishes to strike up a relation-
ship with an interesting group
of youngsters.
February crisis
In the past few days, owing
to certain problems both these
Clubs have been forced tempo-
rarily to close. The main reas-
on for the closure has been
shortage of temporary help.
As is stated in the Albemarle
Report, "...at the operational
level, the Youth Service will
stand or fall by the willing-
ness of the honest-to-goodness
adult who comes along to lend
a hand regtdarly ...as volunt-
ary leader... instructor... or just
one of these indispensable
adults who fulfil the vital
function of being on the spot."
At Imperial College there are
some four thousand students,
out of whom there must surely
be sufficient numbers who
could prevent the kind of cris-
sis which has arisen at the'Off
the Record' Club and at St.
Philips.
On picking up
the Gauntlet
At L.S.E., Bedford, King's,
Q.M.C., Q.E.C., S.O.A.S.,
S.S.E.E.S. and at many other
Colleges, the challenge which
has been offered to students by
Youth Council has for many
years been accepted, and
hundreds of students every
year have been getting to know
many thousands of young
Londoners through Youth
Clubs and YonPh activities.
Imperial College Youth Counc-
il appeals to you to not only
take note of what is going on
in your College, but to take
St. Philips—a first impression
advantage of this unique op-
portunity to involve yourself
in Youth activities, to the bene-
fit of others, but chiefly to the
benefit of the 'Off the Record'
Club and St. Philip's, which
may never function again un-
less you respond.
