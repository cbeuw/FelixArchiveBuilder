THE EARTH IS BASICALLY A WATER PLANET, with
seven tenths of its surface covered by sea. Little is known of
this vast area, as only a minute portion has been charted. The
must productive areas are the continental shelves, lying no deeper
than 1,000 ft and representing ten percent of the ocean floor.
Today, this region is just within reach and it is thought that
in five years time work will be comfortably continuing at these
depths.
There is an estimated oil potential of 100,000 million tons, and the
majority of this could be recovered by under-water drilling operations,
immune to surface storms. Other mineral wealth abounds, and sea
farming is, at piesent, in its infancy. Fresh water, becoming increasingly
more difficult to find on land, could be extracted and pumped ashore.
These represent a few of the -benefits which could be derived from the
ability to work under the sea.
At present the problem is to
survive, for extended periods, un-
der the oceans. Work on this goes
on hi America, France and Rus-
sia, and names such as 'Sealab' or
'Coushelf are now well known. In
this country little is happening, or
so it may appear. The Royal Navy
has stated that such work is out-
side its terms of reference. It is
difficult to imagine any one .in-
dustrial concern putting up at
.least £100,000, in an enterprise
that would be beneficial to the
whole industry, and not just itself.
As a university college, IC is in
a unique position to undertake
such a project and stands an ex-
cellent chance of obtaining serv-
ice co-operation. The designers
would have the whole College to
draw upon for information. There
is a supply of eager and voluntary
labour—sections of the design
could become official projects for
third year undergraduates. There
is also a considerable wealth of
knowledge in the Sub-Aqua field,
and thus the capacity to man the
project, both above and below
water.
With this in mind the Under-
water club have embarked on
project Kraken. This involves the
establishing and manning of an
underwater house and evaluation
of its use for work on the British
Continental Shelf. Additional to
this are tne medical aspects of
living in this hostile environment,
me testing of new ideas in under-
water technology and general
scientific studies.
Previous houses have been
spherical or cylindrical in shape,
but IC intend to use a rectangul-
ar structure, (25'xl5'xl3' high).
Such a structure will be easier to
erect, and since -the internal and
external pressure will be the same,
carries little load. The anticipat-
ed displacement is about 110 tons
of water, so that something in the
region of 60 tons of ballast will
Two persons will live in the
house for a full fortnignt, while
others will stay tor shorter periods;
long enough to carry out particul-
ar research work. The British
Sub-Aqua Club are keenly inter-
ested and are willing to give their
support to the project. Although
the aquanauts are in control below
ine water, a large surface team
will be required. Their job is to
maintain the only links with the
surface—feljscitjricity land telephone!
cables and maintaining a system

A model of Kraken, the house in

supplies and external lighting systems

m,ust be mounted on "levelling

Tho interior is divided into
two large living areas; one damp
for the diving equipment, work-
bench etc., and the other dry for
sleeping, laboratory work, control
and decompression areas. The air
supply to be used is still under
investigation and will possibly be
93% Nitrogen, 7% Oxygen. This
will be circulated continuously
throughout the two week venture,
and thus must be cleaned and
dried.

The big question is, as always,
finance—but this doesn't appear
to be too difficult to arrange. Also
help from the services is expect-
ed, and there will be a meeting
with the Navy in two weeks time.
Then a suitable site has to be
chosen. Three are now under con-
sideration ; Plymouth, West Scot-
land, and the N.E. coast. In fact
a dive has been arranged at
Penlee Point, near Plymouth, to
check on the sea bed and other
conditions.
Now it appears that IC's name
will be added to the brief list of
underwater living concerns, and
by the summer of 1968 all should
be working and the experiments
beginning—quite an exciting pro-
spect for all concerned. Let us
hope that the life of Wyndham's
Kraicen doesn't coincide with that
of ours.

FOUR COLLEGE TEAMS
fought in the U.L. Intercollegiate
Judo Leagues on the first of
February. The first, second and
sixth teams won.—the latter two
fights were walkovers— and the
fifth team drew.
The first beat Kings College by
17 points to nil. P Crossley drew
with his opponent, who was rated
twb belts higher-—.the college
man being an orange belt. M .
Reilly once again demonstrated
that .-.kil1
more than makes up for
physical smallness, and won his
tignt with a clever throw. How-
ever, M. Matthews could only ob-
tain a half-point, against a much
heavier and stronger, but lower
graded, fighter. The fifth team
game was notable for a remark-
able display of gymnastics by D.
Herbstritt, who drew his fight
after escaping from several at-
tempted hold-downs. This was a
very good performance as his op-
ponent was much the bigger of
the two. S. Hyde also drew, and
as both teams were one man
short, the contest ended level.

Despite rumours of apathy in
Imperial College, eleven of
Guild's fifteen years managed to
field at least one team in the
Hugh Ford cup games on Sunday.
Although Civil Eng 1st year took
the trophy and seven gallons of
beer Mech Eng 3, the other final-
ists, were compensated for their
efforts by three gallons and Mech
Eng 2's first team got another
three for being winners of the los-
ers.
The competition was organised
extremely efficiently by Pete Cox
and run as a knockout with all
the first round losers taking part
in the loser's competition so that
each team got at least two games.
After the games and presentat-
ion of the trophy by Professor
Ford himself—stiffness and disap-
pointment were forgotten as an
alcoholic haze descended over
players.

We will give you the training you
will need.
Fisons has world-wide interests.
Its varied activities include the
marketing and manufacture of
fertilizers, agricultural and in-
dustrial chemicals, horticultural
and veterinary products, phar-
maceuticals, scientific apparatus
and foods.
If you want a technical job you
can help find and develop new
products; or join a production
team where organisation and
human relations may be as Im-
portant as technology. Many
fmillions have been invested in
new plant in recent years.
If you prefer new fields, but where
technical knowledge will be use-
ful, try solving commercial prob-
lems. Marketing new products in
the U.K. or overseas requires
imagination, commercial re-
search in depth, and the tenacity
to see a new product through to
the customer—but the rewards
are high.
If computers appeal to you try
operational research or another
management service.

you this term on.
