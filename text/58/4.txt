. Dear S i r ,
I have recently noticed a large increase
i n the number of students wearing College scarves
that have not been purchased at the College Book-
s t a l l .
I myself, prefer a scarf made of a wool-
len material. This i s that employed by a l l the
other colleges i n London and, I think, by most
other English Universities, and I was very sur-
prised to f i n d that the scarves sold at I.C.
differed from the standard foi-m.
I f any other students have any opinions
on t h i s matter, I would be glad to hear their
views, i n order to see i f there would be s u f f i c -
ient support f or motions being put to the various
Unions that the o f f i c i a l college scarves should
be made available i n a thicker woollen material
as well as that at present employed.
Tours sincerely,
Paul Young

Dear Aunt Mildew,
Every day I go to College on the same bus as
a charming and b e a u t i f u l music student. I am very
much attracted by her and would l i k e her to be my
regular g i r l friend.

Dear Lonely Miner,
I recently saw advertised a new breakfast
cereal guaranteed to keep anyone regular. I
should send her seme f o r Christmas.

RECORD REVIEW.
So many long-playing records are being issued these days
that i t must be d i f f i c u l t f o r the average music lever to
choose records which w i l l give reasonable pleasure. I w i l l
try to give reviews that w i l l help c l a s s i c a l "gramophiles."
Delius' "The Mass of L i f e " was f i r s t performed under
S i r Thomas Beecham i n ,1909 and i t i s he who conducts the
r e a l l y magnificent set issued recently on Columbia 33CX
1078/9. This set has given me much pleasure and the per-
formance and recording are extremely good. There are a few
moments at the ends of sides when there i s slight distortion
but 6ne has only to play the f i r s t side to realise what
suberb Delius i t i s . Four soloists and large choral and
orchestral forces are employed i n a t y p i c a l l y Delian manner,
and the work i s sung i n the correct language - German,
aighly recommended.
Beethoven'3 5th Symphony has just suffered a resur-
rection, for KLeiber has recorded on Decca LST 2851 a super-
l a t i v e performance. The only other performance which can
touch i t i s the one of Karajan on Columbia, but the Decca
recording i s so much better that I can safely say that i f
you want t h i s symphony then buy KLeiber. On same grama-
phones i t may seen a l i t t l e harsh, but that w i l l be the
f a u l t of improper L.P, correction. This recording I would
rank as one of Decca'- best.
At l a s t that monumental Symphony Ho. 3 of Saijit-Saens
i s available i n a wonderful performance on Columbia 33CX
1116. This symphony i s written i n memory of L i s z t and was
f i r s t performed i n 1886. The work i s scored f o r a mammoth
orchestra which includes two pianos, an organ and a large
woodwind section. This work i s stated as having two move-
ments but there are many sub-divisions i n these. H i - f i
enthusiasts w i l l note a lack of frequencies above about
8 Kc/s, but i n view of such a t h r i l l i n g performance i t i s
only a small "con."
Extracts • from some of these recordings w i l l be played
at the Monday lunchtime gramophone r e c i t a l s .
