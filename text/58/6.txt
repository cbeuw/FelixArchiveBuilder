If he sounds out of date -with match results,
do not blame your reporter, f o r the results of
league matches arrive by post a week or a f o r t -
night after the last shot i s f i r e d . Unsatis-
factory i n many ways, but cheaper than t r a v e l l i n g
to Birmingham, Durham, Liverpool, Cambridge,
Jrford and Manchester i n successive weeks.'
The Inter-University League table a f t e r three
rounds 3tarts as follows:
S W D L Points Aggregate
1. Cambridge "A" 3 3 0 0 6 2364
2. Imperial College
"A" 3 3 0 0 6 2342
3. Liverpool 3 2 0 1 4 2348
* 3 I write, the "A" team i s i n a state of sus-
pense over i t s match against Liverpool, and by the
time t h i s account i s read most of the cards w i l l
have been shot i n the needle match against Cam-
bridge. Without wishing to chafe the sore of
relations with the University, the R i f l e Club
trumpet must be blown: U.L. "A" are running 5th,
having been soundly beaten by Imperial College as
well as by Cambridge. However, i n the 2nd D i v i s -
ion I.C. "B" l i e s 4th with U.L. "B" 3rd and the
result of the match between them i s i n the post.
Good luck, I.C, : your score looked good enough,
but no doubt London said the same about theirs.'
Nearer home. Imperial College i s s t i l l holding
on to the Engineers' Cup. In D i v i s i o n 1 I.C. "A"
leads the f i e l d with U.C. "A" » close second and
Battersea Polytechnic not f a r behind. I.C. "B"
is f i f t h but have a good aggregate and should soon
rise. The "C team were leading Division 2 after
the second round, but have 3ince had a bye and no
further information i s available for a few days.
They cust beware of U.C. "B", but otherwise seem
f a i r l y safe.
A notable friendly match was shot r
« sntly
when Wimbledon Park R.C. were hosts to I.J. "A".
On a strange and b i t t e r l y cold range Imperial
College did not shoot well and were heavily
defeated by the quietly competent home team. So
quiet was their competence that the names and
heavily-emblazoned shooting Jackets were not at
f i r s t connected with the two stocky l i t t l e men who
chatted easily as the teams prepared to shoot. I t
was Ernie S p i r i t ! and H.R. "tfally" Hammond, B r i t i s h
Internationals, who scored the only two 200's that
evening and quietly supplied as many points-worth
5f advice after the natch. An enjoyable evening,
only curtailed by the approach of the last t r a i n
home.
So much for the teams. On our own range,
the annual Club Competitions have started.
Entries are open u n t i l February 19th, and a l l
cards must be completed by February 26th. There
i s a competition for everyone from the worst shot
upwards: prizes w i l l be presented at the Annual
Dinner on March 25th. Some cards have already
'been shot, but i t i s too early to make predictions.
P i s t o l enthusiasts are competing for the f i r s t

e for the Club P i s t o l Championship. Some
excellent scores have been returned, f o r e t e l l i n g
a healthy start to a new venture.
The f i r s t match between the three Colleges
for the Courtman Shield i s fixed for 7/ednesday
February 17th. - Since 1P32-3 Guilds have won the
trophy eleven times, the R.C.S. nine times, and
the Mines not at a l l . The donor, 2.0. Courtman,
•Jsq., A.R.S.ll., might f e e l he has been l e t down,
•ut on present form the llines are unlikely to
oreak t r a d i t i o n this year. A c r i t i c a l eye reveals
that the Guilds and R.C.S. teams are once again
well-matched: the " t a i l " w i l l win the trophy this
year and decide whether or not the R.C.S. w i l l hold
i t f o r the sixth successive year. R.W.G.
