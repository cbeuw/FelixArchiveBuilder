In the past i t has been customary to p r o f i l e the
Retiring Editors of F e l i x ; however, recently the Editors
have proved to be 'retiring' i n more than one sense, so
i t i s with great pleasure we enclose t h i s P r o f i l e of our
present Editor Emeritus, Mr. D.C. Kale.
Dinesh Chintaman Kale was brought up and received
his early education i n Poona,' (yes, really-) His educ-
ation there proceeded to the point where he received h i s
8.So. (Poona) i n Chemistry. Since then he has s l i g h t l y
changed his interests, so when he came t o England i n
3«ptomber, '52, i t was to enter the R.S.M. as a Fresher.
Although concerned with finding h i s feet i n a
strange fiecmtry and getting to grips with Mining Subjects,
.he found plenty of time f o r Union a c t i v i t i e s . He played
iHockey and Boxed (once) f o r the R.S.M. (mainly to get them?
points, he says). He Joined FELIX i n h i s f i r s t term and
worked up to Editor, which post he took over i n May '53 -
i this s t i l l surprises him since i t was only h i s f i r s t year:
at I.C.
toother achievement i n h i s f i r s t year with which he
was quite pleased was that he learned to dance and has
since settled down to a steady I.C. Hop standard - which
he doesn't want to haprove. An incidental fact about
his f i r s t year at I.C. i s that he got through h i s F i r s t
Mining Es^m.
In Oct >55 he entered 1.0. 004 Hostel, ana i s st*A.,
i n residence there on the top f l o o r . I t i s generally
- I t that he has added even more d i s t i n c t i o n to that
gust body of H o s t e l l t e s , who have rechristened hi»
Danny'.
The f i r s t month of the present Session was spent i n
getting F e l i x back on t o i t s fept again a f t e r the long
Vacation. He was so successful w i t h t h i s that he had t o
spend the second month of the Session resting, and then
the vacation working.'
He s t i l l plays Hockey; and recently he has helped
to start the newly formed International Relations Club.
In coranon with most busy people Dinesh proved very
r e t i c e n t , when asked exactly what he does w i t h h i s spars
time.
His p a r t i c u l a r l i k e s include, Hops, Peter Cheyney,
Beethoven^ Shocolate and Jung. His d i s l i k e s , Mathemat-
i c s , modern composers, tobacco and Shopping.
Fraa the point of view of an Indian i n England
he flays that he finds the climate warmer than ha
expected, that English people t a l k more than he expected,
and that he c e r t a i n l y does more work than he expected.
During vacations he ha3 worked i n Scotland and
Wales; he l i k e s Scotsmen better than Englishman, and
has no comment on Welshmen.
