Birmingham, New College Durham and Hull, using
Imperial as a central collecting point. Other new
ideas were to organise the party for the Hyde Park
Relays which coincided with Valentine's Day this
year. This was a great success and may prove to
be an annual event for Rag. Dave Isherwood and
DramSoc are to be commended for their
unwavering committment in setting up lights etc
throughout the year for our functions.
The Rag constitution this year has been rewritten
and passed in the light of the National Rag
Conference at Loughborough, and is now of a more
structured unit which hopefully shall perform better
next year.
It only remains for me to mention the credits,
which go to Nigel Baker, the publicity team, and
the rag organising committee. The money this year
will be going to the 5 charities we are supporting
this year, namely:
The British Institute for Brain Injured
Children
The National Deaf Children's Society
Imperial Cancer Research Fund
RADAR
The Rectory Paddock School for the Mentally
Handicapped.
I have enjoyed my chair this year of IC Rag, and
I hope that the enthusiasm will carry over for next
year. The real heroes have not been the Rag
Committee or even myself. They are the students,
without which Rag could not have built so strongly.
I wish Nigel and his committee the best of luck
for next year, and just to pass on some sound advice
to him which someone said to me before I
started..."Go get 'em, Floyd!"
Man Tai Tseung
Welfare Officer
Unfortunately there has not been a Welfare Officer
for much of this year and I'm very grateful to
Christine Taig who put in a lot of extra work in
this area. Tom Melliar-Smith, who resigned during
the second term, spent a great deal of time and effort
on the welfare survey. The results will be invaluable
in helping me and others to identify the areas which
need particular work and should be processed soon.
Since I only took over a short time ago, any
questions should be addressed to the people who
were directly involved. I'd like to thank everyone
who helped and took part in the survey, especially
those who prepared the questionnaire and entered
the data.
Tom also helped to coordinate a security
campaign with quite some success, including the
installation of a new lock system in Linstead Hall.
The next major campaign will be the AIDS
information campaign, which Christine is
organising. Any ideas/offer of help will be very
gratefully received.
