FELIX, Friday May 15th 1987
Last Saturday saw IC Rag's 12th
Annual Summer fete which, by all
accounts, was enjoyed by those who
attended. The usual Rag mix of
entertainment and silliness was the
order of the day and anyone who
finished mud-free or dry was
definitely in the minority. The fete
was also an opportunity for the more
serious side of Rag, that of raising
money for charity, to be seen. Two
cheques for £1517 were presented and
also on display, although missed by
most, was the new Variety Club
Sunshine coach for the Rectory
Paddock Mentally Handicapped
from those who ran stalls to those who
didn't disappear when it came to the
drudgery of clearing up. A few people
deserve special mentions; Emma for
taking the party off my hands, Rachel
for helping count the money and
Christine, Abi and Rufus for not
buggering off ten minutes before the
end of the party.
I'm sure that most of you will have
seen the new 'Lemmings Fate '88' T-
shirts and will want one, well they can
now be bought from Kathy in the
Union Office for the paltry sum of
£3.50. (Form an orderly queue
please!) The Rag year is now drawing
FFI IX
Ents
event
Shock horror! two Ents articles in as
many weeks, what can the matter be?
Well firstly just in case you had
forgotten there is a Comedy Cabaret
night in the. Lounge whicR we are
running as a joint venture with Rag.
The evening includes a good mix of
music, humour, juggling and will
only cost you £1.50, plus there is a
very cheap bar with beer at 60p a pint
and lager at 50p a bottle. All this adds
up to rather jolly good value for
money if you ask me (not that you
would).
Secondly the election papers went
up on Tuesday so put your name
down if you're interested. The papers
come down on Tuesday the 26th when
there will be a meeting (or rather
election) in the Lounge at 1.00pm. All
candidates should be there and anyone
can vote. Also all CCU Ents officers
should turn up and all Ents reps would
be most welcome.
Finally, thanks to all those who
came last Friday night.
WellSoc
Wellsian
appeal
As dedicated members may have
noticed, the Wellsian—WellSoc's
'annual' publication—has not
appeared this year. To make up for
this, we want to produce an edition
for the start of next year—and we
need your contributions. Why not, in
those dull times between mugging up
for exams, put pen to paper to
produce short stories, poems,
sketches, cartoons or short non-fiction
articles—on any topic that catches
your fancy. If you want a theme to
work on, there will be a small section
under the heading "Alien"—try your
luck. You stand to win a prize of £10
or £5 for the best contributions, so get
writing.
Contributions may be left in the
FELIX Office (in the orange box
taped to the wall) or in my
pigeonhole. Deadline: 26th June
(end of this term).
Oh yes: if you have any ideas about
speakers you would like to hear next
year, leave a note in either of the
above places.
Kamala Sen
Geology 2
School which was partly paid for by
Rag. Overall £1000 was raised and
this was due in no small part to the
fantastic weather which had been
ordered. I'm glad to see that Rag's
hotline to St Peter is working well.
A plea here, could all those societies
and CCUs who owe money get it to
me as quickly as possible so I can tidy
up the books and pass them over for
auditing. The day ended with a party
in the JCR which was great fun
although it was eventful for the wrong
reasons.
I'd like to thank everyone who
helped make the day such a success,
to a close but there are still a few
events left, the Comedy Nite in the
Lounge tomorrow and later in the
term we're off to Covent Garden
carol singing (not my idea!). Lastly,
the Rag A G M takes place on
Monday. It starts at 12.45pm and the
main items on the agenda are the
election of next year's officers and the
choosing of the charities for
'Lemmings Fate 1988'. If you feel it's
time to get involved in Rag or want
Rag to support a particular charity
next year, come along as new faces
are always welcome.
