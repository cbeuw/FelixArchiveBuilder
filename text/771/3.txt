News FELIX, Friday May 15th 1987 3
Students
face
disruption in
Beit
basement
Students on the ground floor of Beit
Old Hostel may have a noisy time
while revising for their exams this and
next month. This will be due to the
demolition of some basement internal
walls and the subsequent construction
of a laundry and staff room. Mr
Steven Rumford, a resident of Beit
has complained formally to Dr Job
Finley, warden of Beit Hall, about the
work, which will commence on May.
26th and continue for three weeks. Mr
Rumford asked that the work be
postponed until the end of term as he
feels the "undue" noise at exam time
would "disturb students at critical
periods" thus contravening College
policy. As yet there has been no
official response, but in a letter to
John Smith, John Finley has
suggested that moving affected
students to alternative accommodation
might be a suitable solution.

Fred leaves after 3 years
Felix staff mourned, on Tuesday, the
passing of Fred Jr, a much loved and
valuable part of the FELIX
production team. Fred left after the
induction of Gaza who. though
younger and less experienced, has
made a considerable impact on
FELIX's operations since his arrival.
Fred was eventually made redundant
and left FELIX without even a
souvenir. He took Norman Tebbit's
advice to 'get on his bike' and found
a job in Durham. The FELIX staff are
very grateful for the contribution Fred
Jr made to FELIX since he came to
IC in September 1983. The Varityper
was named Fred by former typesetter
operator Maz Fellows.
