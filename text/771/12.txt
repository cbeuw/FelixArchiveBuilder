News, FELIX, Friday May 15th 1987 1 2
Watergate, Irangate,
Howgate!
Ian Howgate (Geology III) has been
elected as IC Union President for next
year. The election was re-held after*
the previous election was declared
invalid at the end of last term. Despite
only two candidates standing
origninally, the re-run produced a
field of five candidates.
In a poll of 869 votes, Mr Howgate
passed quota of 436 votes after three
reallocations under the STV (Single
Transferrable Vote) system used in
ICU sabbatical elections. He reached
a total of 442 votes, enough to reach
a clear majority of the votes cast.
The re-run election was
considerably less accriminous than the
first. It was run in a blaze of apathy,
with no candidate producing any
publicity until the Thursday before
polling, a full week after papers were
taken down. The length of the 'phony
war' meant that candidates did not
conduct campaigns as extensive as in
recent years.
When questioned by a FELIX
reporter, Mr Howgate gave some idea
of his intentions and priorities for next
year. He was glad about the large
field of candidates and thought that
the turnout was quite high considering
the distraction of exams for most
students. He said that one of his first
tasks would be to learn more about
external affairs, particularly ULU,
about which he confessed to having
little knowledge. Also he wished to
find out about the extraction of gravel
from the sports fields at Harlington,
a source of much confusion and
misinformed comment. He also wants
to increase awareness of the Silwood
Park field station, about which he felt
that IC students had little knowledge
apart from the RCS Silwood Ball in
the summer term. Perhaps one
solution would be to arrange some
sort of visit early in the autumn term.
Mr Howgate said that he thought that
some sort of factual comparison for
answers to questions at the Hustings
UGM would be useful, as most
students would not be aware of the
correct answers to more detailed
questions.
Surprisingly, the election campaign
seemed to be little affected by the
knowledge that the other two
sabbatical officers were already
elected; Alan Rose as Deputy
President and Chas Jackson as
Honorary Secretary.
A breakdown of the total voting
figures is given below showing the
STV system in operation, with
allocation of preferences until one
candidate reaches or passes the
required quota.
Typesetting
Marathon
FELIX would like to say thankyou to
typesetter operator Rose Atkins, who
typed the whole of FELIX, including
the annual reports, in just over three
days. Rose said yesterday that she was
looking forward to thinner issues as
the term progressed. FELIX will be
adopting a new policy of only
accepting club articles if the club
reffered to send along people to
collate. In addition, Dave Colley will
have to type all his articles. Any
Union Officer who is reading this
after submitting a report but not
turning up to collate may consider
themselves humbled.
Engineering
award
James Sturgeon, a final year student
in the Civ Eng Dept has won a
prestigious prize at the Institute of
Civil Engineers. This prize for the
Institution Medal and Premium
(Universities) Competition was for a
paper entitled; "Being constructive
with people: man-management and
the role of the site engineer". This
was the first national competition for
this prize for which entrants were
required to write a 4000 word essay.
Five entrants were selected to make
a presentation and undergo a
discussion about their papers.
IC elections
There will be elections at the IC
Union Annual General Meeting
(AGM) next Tuesday, in Mech. Eng.
220 at 1.00pm. When papers came
down yesterday, the following posts
were contested: for five delegates to
the University of London Union
General Union Council (GUC), th,^
were six candidates; Chris Martin
(DoC), Simon Bosher (Physics), D
Clements (Physics), S Kilmurray
(Physics), Dave Jones (Physics) and
Bill Goodwin (Mech. Eng.).
Also contested were the two
ordinary members of Union Finance
Committee (UFC); standing were
Steve Kilmurray (Physics), Neil
Motteram (DoC), A Pugh (Physics)
and David Jones (Physics).
Amongst the posts that were
uncontested, Charles Brereton
(Biochem) stood for Academic
Affairs Officer, Alastair Seymour
(Elec. Eng.) and Sunny Bains
(Physics) stood for the two Ordinary
Members of Council, Kamala Sen
(Geology) was unopposed for
Haldane Book Buyer, and Chris
Martin (DoC) was the only candidate
for FELIX Business Manager.
The papers for Haldane Library
Record Buyer are to stay up for a
further period of time while the post
is publicised more widely, and there
were no nominations for the positions
of Publicity Officer and the three
Ordinary Members of House
Committee.
Gay support
ICU Union Council has passed a
motion in support of a non-voting
Council post to represent gay and
lesbian students at College. The
motion, prepared by Union President
Christine Taig and seconded by
Deputy President Jackie Peirce, called
for Council's backing for gay and
lesbian welfare officer. This is
currently a co-opted post, but it is
hoped that a Gay Society will shortly
be in existence, and that this society
will be able to nominate its own
representative.
Elec Eng Dep Rep Alistair
Seymour questioned whether creating
a post to represent the Gay Society
might "open the floodgates for all
College clubs and societies to demand
their own representative". Academic
Affairs Officer Dave Lowrie
commented that all societies already
had representation through the major
sub-committee chairman.
Ms Taig and several other speakers
thought that it was a very positive
move to create a specific non-voting
post for gay and lesbian students.
When taken to a vote the motion was
passed unanimously.
