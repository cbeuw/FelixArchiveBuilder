Letters. FELIX, Friday May 15th 1987
Imperial Gay
not OK
Dear Dave,
FELIX has been a forum for much
discussion on the subject of
homosexuality recently. With the
exception of a rather coy and
defensive letter written from a
Christian standpoint, no objections
have been publicly raised to the
commitment of Union resources to
lesbian and 'gay' welfare. Yet such
objections can be presumed to exist
within Imperial; why else the long
delay in instituting measures that have
been commonplace in other colleges
for years? A section of one of your
recent editorials, subtitled "Gay
News Blues", finally prompted me to
contribute my own thoughts on the
subject.
Society in the 1980's is
technologically and economically the
most sophisticated that the world has
ever know, but it still has a surprising
amount in common with earlier
civilisations. Historically, all
communities have developed and
grown through the tutelage of their
young in the ways of society. Thus
they, and their subsequent progeny,
can build on the current
achievements. This education is
implemented partly through the
formal education system, but most
fundamentally through the parent-
child relationship. In this way, the
external aspects of an economy can
develop and grow enormously, while
the basic aspects of people's lives
remain very similar. The family unit
as a social building block is not
cultural propaganda circulated by the
present government (or indeed Queen
Victoria), but empirical fact, in all the
great societies the world has known,
like it or not, these are cultural norms
we live by.
In the light of this discussion, the
nature of sexual relationships in
society can be seen to be of great
importance to its development. That
a stable enough relationship between
and man and a woman can be built
up to allow the intellectual, emotional
and social development of their
children is a real need societies have.
It follows that, within such a society,
certain types of behaviour are
aberrant; amongst these are rape,
indiscriminate sexual intercourse, and
homosexuality. All three examples
have been present in our society, to
a greater or lesser degree, since its
inception. In the past, they have been
regarded as outside normal or
approved behaviour. It now appears
that certain segments of society wish
to establish at least the latter two
practices as acceptable.
Why might this be? A logical
explanation defeats me. Not only is
homosexuality a socially useless, even
destructive, activity; it is also most
unappealing aesthetically. Its
principal act of consummation is a
scatological parody of sexual
intercourse, rejecting all aspects of a
sexual relationship except the purely
tactile. The feeling of revulsion this
engenders, when coupled with sexual
immaturity and a profound lack of
intelligence, results in the activity of
'queer bashing', which seems to rise
in proportion to the social acceptance
of homosexuality in other quarters.
Perhaps those who have not yet
resolved their adolescent
disagreements with their parents see
this as a symptom of social
oppression; the reality is simply a lack
of social acceptance, for some people,
the mere scent of an an oppressed
minority in need is enough to bring
out the banners and petitions.
These are the reasons why I reject
the arguments you propose in your
editorials in favour of 'gay' rights.
When you state that human sexual
feelings are more complicated than a
desire to penetrate other peoples'
bodies, you are correct. The
complexity is added by the desire to
extend an emotional relationship
physically, the desire to demonstrate
the depth of your affection, the desire
to create new life. A desire to be
penetrated yourself adds no
complexity, merely some variety to
pointless hedonism. If we are to be
idealists, as all good students should,
we should strive for a society in which
homosexuals could be shown
compassion, be allowed to get on with
their lives, and be protected from
mindless violence. A society where
homosexuality is institutionalised is
not ideal. It is a contradiction, and one
I want no part of. We still have the
opportunity to prevent this happening
at IC Union. I have neither the time
nor the energy to organise any
concerted effort to achieve this. Any
student who feels empathy with this
aim can show it by writing to FELIX,
and by making sure it is an important
issue for the presidential elections.

Confusion and
corruption
Dear Dave,
Following the recent requests in
FELIX for correspondence on the
'gay rights' issue I wonder if I can
make some comments.
I think it is fair to say that in any
argument over 'right and wrong' most
protagonists are accepting some form
of objective morality; that there are
right or best attitudes to the way we
should live and that confusion and
corruption have entered into some
peoples lives who have got it wrong.
It is no doubt true, I think we can say,
that our world does harbour much
corruption. However convinced,
then, a particular person is that he is
in the right I think it would take a
rather naive or arrogant person to
claim that, in all areas of their life,
they are completely unaffected by
such confusion, especially with regard
to 'gut' reactions.
Discussions over right uses of
human sexuality do most often, I
think, strongly acknowledge that it is
a valuable thing, and not least those
in FELDC. We hear of the hurt caused
to homosexuals by them sometimes
being automatically regarded as
promiscuous, of Robert Daniel's
sadness caused by seeing
heterosexuality being reduced to just
'sleeping with a member of the
opposite sex" (March 6th) and of
Andrew Bannister's encouragement
to people holding some views on the
use of sex to undergo deep
'questioning (of) their attitudes"
(May 8th).
People on both sides, then, of the
'gay rights' debate can definitely start
from common ground; that there are
rights and wrongs on this issue. Some
people have got it wrong. Confusion
and corruption have indeed entered
into this area also (and caused much
conflict). Let us clearly acknowledge
they have and that means especially
with regard to people's gut reactions,
even, and yes especially, with regard
to sexual desires (as per the quoted
points above). It would seem to me,
then, to not be helpful for the idea
(even if it be a fact) that a significant
proportion of adolescent males
experience sexual feelings towards
other men to be treated as a significant
reason for supporting
"progress...made on the gay rights
front" (Editorial May 1st) without
explaining why such feelings must be
regarded as being in line with right,
uncorrupted attitudes to life.
I for one would prefer to hear less
of claims about subjective feelings (or
indeed of the cries of "homophobia")
and for the discussion to turn more
onto tackling the question: What is the
right relationship between sex and
love?
Yours sincerely,
Hugh MacKenzie, Civ Eng RA.
Insensitive and
cynical
Dear Dave,
I was quite looking forward to the
gossip column about Silwood, which
was bound to be written.
When it finally appeared, I was
furious to find that the very serious
and beautiful intention of Steph and
Mark to get married was more or less
laughed at.
Could you please name the idiot
who said that the odds against the
marriage were 5:1 so I can skin
him/her alive! Of all the insensitive,
cynical and destructive things to say,
this has to be one of the nastiest feats
of backbiting possible.
Steph and Mark were slagged off
even before they started going out
with each other, so I suggest you guys
start leaving them alone.
Anyway, I'd like to congratulate
them both again and wish them all the
happiness in the world. Don't let
things get you down, Steph!
Love, Ina El-Kadhi
Objective
morality
Dear Dave,
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was
under the impression that FELIX was
a student newspaper. If this is indeed
so, could you please enlighten me as
to why such articles as "Censored"
which appeared in last week's FELIX
are given space in which to slag off
members of the College. I refer, of
course, to the part about Mark and
myself and our engagement.
To my way of thinking an
announcement of this kind should be
a happy occasion not only for the two
people involved, but for the people
that know them, and can share in their
happiness and good fortune. Why
does it have to be different for us?
True, we have not been together for
very long but if we feel its the right
decision, what right have people who
hardly know us to slag us off for it.
I know that I would not take such a
large step unless I was sure and I'm
sure Mark will agree with me.
When we decided to get engaged it
was a a prelude to marriage (which
is incidently, the definition of
engagement). It doesn't matter
whether the decision comes after 4
years or 4 months of a relationship;
it is still the most important and
serious step anyone can take in their
lives. We certainly didn't take the
decision lighdy by any means, so who
the hell does the writer think he/she
is by saying "undisclosed sources
would lay 5:1 against a marriage ever
taking place".
When Kathy Tait and John Ingham
got engaged, everyone was full of
congratulations for them (including
FELIX). I can't see any difference,
so why can anyone else.
I'm sure, Dave, that if you and
Judith were in the same position, you
would be angered and upset about
such comments and would not dream
of allowing such crap to be printed.
We both feel that we have been
victimised and I don't see why we
should have to suffer it. I hope that
when the person who wrote the article
finds out how upset we are he/she will
reveal him/herself and apologise
publicly.
Yours sincerely,
Stephanie Snell, Physics I
