Boat Club Ghent Trip
Making waves
At the 9th International Belgian
Rowing Championships held in Ghent
last weekend, IC won one gold, two
silvers and a bronze medal against
some very tough international
competition including national teams
from Belgium, West Germany, Cuba,
France, Portugal, Holland and
Mexico as well as many top crews
from the UK.
Following a short and
uncomfortable nights sleep on Friday
in a Belgian Army Barracks, IC
managed to shrug off some of the
tiredness and qualified for two of the
afternoons finals. In the lightweight
double skulls, the IC crew did not
perform as well as they had hoped in
the final, losing the bronze medal to
the Belgians by some six feet. The
open coxless four did however
perform better going a well deserved
bronze medal in a high class field just
behind the German and French
national squad crews.
On Sunday, all the crews were
determined to do even better and this
was proven right from the start when
in the heats of the under 23 sculls,
Vince BA Roper came through in the
last 500 meters to get a place in the
final. The lightweight double again
dispelled any rumours that their
nickname 'splash the crab' was true
when they won their heat
comfortably. In the coxless fours, IC
raced in both the open and under 23
events. Both crews made the finals,
beating off a lot of stiff competition
from both the UK and abroad. As
luck would have it, all four finals fell
in the space of 45 minutes which
meant that our coach Bill 'super
cyclist' Mason managed to cover
some 16km watching and
encouraging each crew in the finals.
In the first of the IC finals, Vince
Roper sculling in his boat 'Black
Adder I' had a hard fought race from
the start and was lying 5th until half
way before moving through in the last
1000m with an 'Adder Burn' to take
a well deserved silver medal. In the
double sculls, the IC crew although
lying 4th with only 750m to go
managed a sustained push to go
through and win a silver behind the
winning Dutch crew. In the open
coxless fours, IC were really up
against it but they fought hard all the
way finishing a very close 4th, under
one second off a medal winning time.
The Under 23 coxless four who are
looking for GB selection for the
World Student Games led from start
to finish in their race leaving both
French and German Squad crews
trailing behind.
This gold medal rounded off a very
successful weekend for the Boat Club
and gives good hope for all the crews
who raced all of whom are now
looking for international selection.
Other good performances came
from the dynamic single scullers of
K Steinlechner and JVB Towndrow.
The crews were:
Open (Sat) Under 23 (Sun)
4—J Walker, J Waller, G.
Pooley and C Behrens
Open 4—N Reynolds, H
Michels, A McChesney and K
Steinlechner.
Lightweight 2x—S Pearson,
R Gee
Waterski Club
Making a splash
At last! After two terms disap-
pointment, in which everything that
could possibly have gone wrong with
the boat did go wrong, we, the
Waterski Club, are definitely back in
full operation. The boat's engine was
overhauled before the beginning of
term, and last Wednesday 6 members
(including a complete beginner) had
the lake to themselves and were able
to ski all afternoon until dusk. We ski
at Burghfield Aqua Sports Club (50
minutes' drive from College), where
we have free use of changing rooms,
showers, clubhouse, slalom course
and jump ramp. We have a Delta
Sport boat powered by a Ford 3-litre
V6 inboard engine supplying 140 hp,
and we organise trips every Tuesday,
Wednesday or any day of the week
when there is enough interest. The
Club possesses all the necessary
equipment (skis, flotation jackets,
wetsuits etc) and also provides some
of the cheapest waterskiing in Britain,
so if you're at all interested, come
along to any of our meetings which
are held every Monday at 12.30pm
above Southside Bar. Alternatively,
drop me a line through the Elec Eng
pigeonholes.

Harrowing Day
Making fools of themselves
Or "How not to write a sports report"
On Saturday May 9th, young
members from the Institutions of
Civil, Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers competed at the Harrow
Sports Stadium for the prestigious
Young Trophy.
The most impressive team
performance came from the
Mechanical Engineering swimmers,
made up exclusively by Imperial
College students. Team captain
'Hector' Sullivan and newcomer
Andy Law were unfortunate to lose
their 100m freestyle races to Civil
Engineers, though Hector recorded a
new Institution best of 1 minute 9
seconds. Fellow members 'Gismo'
Goodsell and 'Pope' J P Hansen—on
loan from Vatican City—won their
races convincingly, a particularly
creditable result for Gismo
considering the strong opposition.
The consistent skill of these young
swimmers was best seen in the relay,
where they totally devastated their
already demoralised opponents, to
win by over two lengths. The event
would not have been complete
without the traditional inspection of
the pool bottom by referee Fraggle
'steady as a rock' Strawbridge.
The Mechanicals scored another
notable victory in the table tennis,
though the cricket, 5-a-side,
badminton and squash events were
won by teams from the less well
respected branches of Engineering.
One of the most remarkable
individual performances of the day
came from another Imperial
Student—Mechanical Engineer Basil
Heaney—in the squash event. Taking
into account the rigorous training that
he had undertaken in the Union
Lounge the night before, he lost his
first match with a commendable 9-0,
9-0, 9-0, and went on to score 9-2,
9-2, 9-0 in his second.
By the end of the day, the
Mechanicals emerged as worthy,
overall winners—the third year in a
row that they have done so. When
asked to comment on their memorable
victory, 'Pope' J P said "I wish there
had been a roller skating event,
Harry".
So what a day it's been for the
Young Mechanical Engineers,
winning the swimming, the table
tennis, the Young Trophy and missing
the Rag Fete. And now over to Ron
Pickering in the swimming pool...
