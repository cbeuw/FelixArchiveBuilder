Okay
I'm glad to say that things are
beginning to move at last. Firstly, at
ICU Council on Monday I was co-opted
as Lesbian and Gay Welfare Officer
after a firey speech by Hurricane
Christine, who deserves all the credit.
Better than that, though, is that as
a result of recent publicity people have
started getting in touch with me. and
the members of our Wednesday
meetings are gradually increasing. I
can only say again that if you do want
to come along please do, and if you
want to chat with me first I can be
reached via the Union Office, or via
Geology pigeonholes.
I don't seriously expect any Gay
movement at IC really to get off the
ground until next term—the summer
term is not the campaign season, after
all. However, if we manage to get next
term off to a good start, hopefully with
a stall at Freshers' Fair, then we should
do pretty well. It is important that we
keep ticking over until then, so that
anyone who does want to come and
see us can, and so that we have a
nucleus with which to get going next
year.
Thanks to the people who turned up
on Wednesday—I'm very sorry I
didn't. I hope you managed to have
a meeting anyway. See you next
week. 12.30 in the Green Committee
Room in the Union Building.
Bye for now,
Andrew Bannister
Residences
At the next Student Residence
Committee on Wednesday 27th May
there will be a long and tortuous
discussion about rent increases for
next session. Throughout the
negotiations about buying the new
Evelyn Gardens houses I have
repeatedly said that College must go
ahead with the purchase. It is my view
that accommodation near College is
going to become more and more
difficult to find and that given the gap
between rents in private
accommodation in this area and those
in student residences. 1 feel that we
should be prepared to accept a rent
increase in order to pay for the new
houses.
Nobody wants this to happen, and
many people have said 'let College
find the money from elsewhere'.
Given the severe restrictions placed on
the College by the UGC over the
spending of public funds—and given
the College's own £3M deficit—this is
rather optimistic to say the least.
Residences have, by law, to be self-
financing or paid for by the College's
private income. One of the few ways
of financing the loan to buy new
houses would be to use the income
from the sale of Harlington Gravel; this
would reduce the necessary rent
increase from around £7.50pw over
several years to about £5pw over the
same time. On the other hand it would
end plans for a new indoor sports hall
to be paid for by the gravel money.
One argument frequently used in
this context is the fact that, since
students cannot claim housing benefit
when living in hall, they would
actually be better off living in private
sector accommodation if hall rents go
up by so much. The other side of this
argument is the fact that the
Conservatives are committed to taking
students out of the benefits system
altogether and if they return to power
on June 11th (as seems likely) then
students will quite probably no longer
be able to claim benefit wherever they
live. This makes the need to provide
cheaper accommodation for as many
students as possible an even greater
priority of the College.
1 am firmly convinced that the
purchase of this hall is essential and
that, since it is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, and is not purely a
prestige, conference type facility we
should be prepared to accept rent
increases to pay for it. I have therefore
encouraged the College to go ahead
with the deal. If the student body is
unwilling to accept the necessary
increases after the purchase, and if the
money cannot be found elsewhere,
then the building will have to be sold
and the 200 extra residence places will
be lost.
PLEASE come to the AGM next
Tuesday if you have a view on this
matter—hopefully we can come to
some sort of consensus on the issue.
Lesbian and Gay Welfare
Last Monday, Council decided to make
the post of the Lesbian and Gay
Welfare Officer a permanent one. The
post will be a non-voting one on
Council, currently held by a co-opted
volunteer but in future by a nominee
of the Lesbian and Gay Society—when
one officially comes into existence.
It is true that any Union member
can attend Council and ask for
speaking rights. However this is a
positive commitment by Council to
ridding Imperial College once and for
all of its ridiculously homophobic
attitudes and atmosphere. I have been
waiting for four years to see some
progress in this direction and I'm
proud that it has happened during my
term of office.
Andy Bannister of Geology I has
been co-opted by Council to carry out
this role for the remainder of the year,
since Robert Daniel has left College.
Rag
Last Saturday's Rag Fete was a great
success—helped by perfect weather
and a lot of hard work by the people
concerned. The party in the evening
was not so wonderful, largely because
of very drunken people causing
trouble and starting fights, breaking
the door in the JCR and hassling those
people who were trying to collect
door-money for Rag charities. As usual
the trouble-makers were not the ones
to clear up the mess, and surveying
the damage at 2.30am I really
wondered why people carry on
putting on events like this to be met
by plenty of hassle and few thanks.
None the less they do—I for one am
most grateful (
1 even enjoyed most of
the party immensely!) and would like
to extend thanks to Nigel, Rachel, Man
Tai and all the others who worked so
hard on Saturday.
Finally
Don't forget the Union's Annual
General Meeting next Tuesday, 1pm
in Mech Eng 220. This is your last
chance to put us on the spot over
anything we have or have not done
over the past year
See you there,
Christine
