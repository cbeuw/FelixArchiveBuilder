Editorial FELIX, Friday May 15th 1987 4
In with the new
Despite Ian Howgate's ability to irritate
a lot of people, he was in many respects
the most suitable candidate in the
presidential election. His experience and
knowledge of Union affairs were at least
as good as any of his rivals, and he was
without doubt the most conscientious
and dedicated. Nevertheless the news of
his election was not considered good
cause for cracking open another case of
sherry in the Union Office on
Wednesday night. Too many Union
officers have, rightly or wrongly, treated
him with extreme cynicism this year. It
is easy to agree with them after sitting
through an average session of ICU
Council, during which his opinion is
heard on every subject, whether or not
he has any opinion to express, or even
any knowledge of the issues.
Ian has done some useful work for the
Union, particularly on Residences,
during his time at College. His
weaknesses are his tendency to overreact
to many situations, and, frankly, his
knack for rubbing people up the wrong
way. This not all bad news; his pushy
attitude will prevent there being another
'silent president' on College committees
and. if his enthusiasm lasts, he should
not tire of the more testing aspects of
the job. He has the ability, but not the
temperament.
Now that we know who all the
sabbaticals and Executive officers for
1986/87 it is hard to be hopeful for next
year. If Ian is irritating, Alan Rose is
the most caustic Union officer we have
had for years. He has experience of the
Union, but I can think of little to
recommend him. Alan likes nothing
better than to sit in the Union Bar all
night, trading cynical quips with anyone
else who find themselves propped up
against the counter. His decision to
propose one of the candidates in the
presidential election was both
irresponsible, and a measure of his
inflated ego. While Ian rushes round
making everybody's life difficult, Alan
will be downing another pint, sitting
back, taking life easily and telling
himself how well he is doing.
Chas Jackson is a much more amiable
character than either of his colleagues
and will no doubt do well in his job as
Hon Sec. Unfortunately I do not think
he will be interested in exerting much
of an influence on the Executive as a
whole.
More on Gay News
At last we appear to have stimulated
some thoughtful discussion of the
gay/lesbian issue; there are two letters
printed on page 2, which are at least,
interesting reading. I shall be happy to
print further correspondence on the
subject.
An Apology
included or not, then they must be
referred to me directly. What gets
printed in FELIX is ultimately my
responsibility and I will not have
members of the student staff questioned
upon the origin of any material. I will
not disclose the identity of any
anonymous contributors and I do not
expect any other member of FELIX staff
to be approached.

On reflection, last week's gossip column
was rather unkind and overly personal.
