Security breach blamed on students
N E W S T E A M
Following a significant breach of hall
security, students have been remind-
ed not to let strangers into College
residences and to alert Security if
they see anyone suspicious. This
comes in the wake of an incident on
Sunday night in Evelyn Gardens
when an intruder entered Holbein
Hall despite high levels of security.
A man is believed to have gained
entry by jumping the back garden
wall and climbing in through the
basement of house number 62, at
around 11.45pm. He then proceeded
to wander in and out of open student
rooms unchallenged before exiting
via an open ground floor window,
leaving the back doors still on the
latch.
A number of male students using a
nearby hall kitchen noticed the
intruder and turned off the light in
order to observe him without being
seen. They were later able to provide
College Security officials with a
detailed description of the stranger,
who was black, 6'3" tall, had tied-
back dreadlocks and was wearing an
orange T-shirt with a black jacket
and jeans. The students had previ-
ously spotted a shorter black male,
possibly an accomplice, acting suspi-
ciously in the doorway of number 62
but were unable to give a fuller
description.
As soon as they were notified, a
security guard accompanied Mr
Travis, the warden, in a hasty search
of the building. By this time the tres-
passers had disappeared. Believing
there might still be a threat to resi-
dents, the security officer remained
in the darkened kitchen for some
time but saw nothing unusual.
Uproar at Wilson House
M A T T K E M P T O N
Students at St Mary's Medical
School are angry that non-medics
have been given places in Wilson
House. 10 empty rooms were adver-
tised two weeks ago and all but two
have now been taken up by IC stu-
dents from South Kensington.
The root of this discontent can be
traced back to last April, when clini-
cal students started applying for
place in the hall. First year clinical
students were advised not to apply
because their chance of success was
thought to be slim, with priority
going to finalists and freshers.
Speaking to Felix, Bryan Clarke, the
Warden of Wilson House, said the
rooms had become available for a
short period because some of the res-
idents had travelled abroad to carry
out the elective study that forms part
of their course. He went on to point
out that no medical students applied
for the rooms after the advertisement
had gone up.
Medical students, however, told a
very different story. They argued that
these spare rooms could have been
foreseen and that they should have
been offered to the first year clinical
students. The rooms were not being
sought after now because the dis-
pleased students had already found
alternative accommodation, for
which they have to pay at least twice
the rent of Wilson House.
Mr Clarke stoutly defended the
allocation policy. It was his opinion
that the availability of the rooms
concerned could not been predicted
as it depended on what options the
students took. The medics, though,
were not convinced that this was
simply another bureaucratic cock up
on the part of the College. Most of
them saw this as a well orchestrated
manouvre by IC to start introducing
non-medics into Wilson House, and
in doing so break an earlier promise
that Wilson House would remain
solely for clinical students after the
merger in 1998.
Mr Clarke put up a brave face by
saying, "The students feel threat-
ened, I understand that." Clinical stu-
dents starting their day at 6.30 am,
and not finishing until 10.30 pm for
full 48 weeks of their academic year
on top of this, they need to do this for
48 weeks a year can have their life
made easier by the College if they
can kindly provide them with accom-
modation. The future could be more
congested; with the formation of the
new ICSM, there will be 320 stu-
dents in a year, which is beyond the
capacity of Wilson House.
Bookstore tender passed
continued from front page
their second reading with continued
disquiet regarding some of their
implications. ICU Council con-
firmed its decision to follow the
model of the Conservative Party in
allowing their Appeals Committee to
increase penalties and fines imposed
by a Union Disciplinary Committee.
The Health and Safety policy was
amended to allow lists of students
partaking in "External Activities" to
be submitted two days prior to an
event. Previous suggestions that lists
should be provided seven days prior
to an activity taking place received
repeated objections. The Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies) also
conceded that names of students par-
taking in regular activities can be
submitted on one occasion for a
number of events.
The Publicity Policy, facing its
first reading following its withdraw-
al from the previous Council meet-
ing, also came in for repeated attack.
Some Council members had reserva-
tions about the instruction that all
writing on both posters and flyers
should be in the English language.
This may prove especially difficult
for Overseas Clubs and Societies
whose logos contain words in a for-
eign language, and for those wishing
to include the Imperial College logo
in their publicity, as it contains Latin.
Constituent College Union offi-
cials combined to defeat most of the
sabbatical officers in an amendment
which will allow CCUs to control
publicity relating to their Clubs and
Societies.
News in Brief
EXTREMISM RETURNS
Extreme Islamic student group
activity throughout London Univers-
ity is on the rise again after a lull of
several months. Reports of funda-
mental activity at freshers' fairs and
other union events have multiplied
since the summer.
In order to evade University or
Union jurisdiction, Islamic group
members have been distributing
leaflets just outside the entrance of
King's College in London. The
leaflets end with mobile phone num-
bers which are apparently untrace-
able. When questioned, the student
leafleters admitted that they were not
based at Kings but were from other
London colleges.
The often controversial ideas of
fundamentalist Muslims have caused
problems in other universities in
England as well, with an Islamic
group in Liverpool University shut
down after trying to ban the Jewish
society.
This mirrors problems suffered by
colleges in the past few years where
such groups did not advertise in their
own college but went to others to
avoid being recognised. A statement
from King's College Union stated
"We find it important to protect our
students from fundamentalism, espe-
cially the religious type. King's has
had problems with such groups of all
faiths in the past."
O X F A M FAST
At least one hundred and twenty peo-
ple from Imperial College will be
taking part in Oxfam's national Fast
for Basic Rights on 15th November.
This event is being held to raise
awareness of poverty and human
rights. In the UK, 14.1 million peo-
ple live in poverty, and worldwide,
800 million do not have enough to
eat. The fast involves people spend-
ing 24 hours without something that
usually they take for granted, for
example food or cigarettes. Anyone
interested in taking part should con-
tact Oxfam Campaign.
BIKE THIEF
APPREHENDED
Last week, South Kensington police
apprehended a young man in the
process of stealing a bicycle near to
College. At the moment, it is thought
that he could be responsible for some
of the numerous other bicycle thefts
in the area, especially in and around
campus. The police have detained
him for further questioning.
