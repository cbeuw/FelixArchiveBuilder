FELIX FRIDAY 8TH NOVEMBER C O L U M N S 11
Many moons ago, when I was in
Linstead, a number of the inmates
were most adept at the consumption
of alcohol (not me, of course, I was a
Horlicks and biccies man myself).
The current crowd, it would appear,
are destined for the stage. Some mar-
vellous voice projection enabled me
to catch the following snippets as I
wandered through Princes Gardens
last week. After carpeting Estates
over Clayponds (don't excuse that
pun, it was awful), it would appear
that Security have been less than
their usual flawless selves. As the
residents continued their conversa-
tion, it emerged that the wardens had
planned a fire drill a couple of weeks
ago. Good idea, you say, it's a legal
requirement. So the wardens pressed
the relevant button, stood outside and
awaited the half-asleep Linsteadians.
And they waited. And they waited.
For, dear reader, the alarm did not
sound. Very serious, you say, some-
one should get a ticking off. Still they
would soon get it fixed, these things

happen, and it could all be repeated
the next day. Oh dear. Silent alarms
again. Now you do not need to be a
genius to work out what would have
happened if there
had been a real
fire. Nor do you
have to be
Rumpole of the
Bailey to realise
the legal conse-
quences. This fire
alarm has been
the subject of
constant com-
plaint since
before I arrived
here in 1993. It

that this is untrue and I shouldn't
worry my little head about it. Or
maybe not.
This on its own
is very serious,

of a very unfunny
man, there's
more. The subject

from the balcony.

Basil Fawlty before us, that when we

Graham Cox was mentioned. I do

the use of routing all emergency calls
through College Security if they are
left in limbo like this? When Security

state of education in Britain will have
to wait a while. So finally, it is a joy
to say something wholly positive
about this dear old place. I refer to
last week's Commemoration day.
Congratulations must go to my good
friends in the College Registry, under
the able leadership of Vernon
McClure (I got it right this time!).
We've not seen eye to eye in the past,
but this time you came through with
flying colours, and who cares if it
was a week late. From start to finish,
it was thoroughly enjoyable and the
memorable occasion that one's grad-
uation should be. The ball in the
evening was also a stunning success
and full marks to all involved in that.
So to all you freshers out there, Uncle
Simon says stick at that degree,
because the finale is well worth wait-
ing for.
Hey there! Fancy spending your next summer i n Delaware?
Dela-where? I hear you say.
Delaware, in the USA! Well, the
UROP-Delaware Exchange Scheme
allows you to do just that. Each year
five IC students spend 8 week's
doing research at the University of
Delaware (UD). This is not only an
excellent opportunity to pump up
your CV by working overseas, but
also to help those students facing the
dilemma of staying on to do a PhD. or
go and get a 'real' job, by giving
them an idea of what research is all
about. If you already know what you
want to do then that's fine too, since
you can still have tons of fun and
experience the American way of life.
UD has a very different environ-
ment from that of IC. For a start, it's
a campus-based university in the
small city of Newark. UDs reputation
mainly lies in their chemical engi-
neering dept, partly due to the con-
nections they have with DuPont.
They rank 6th in the country.
However, many of their other depart-
ments are also well respected and
acknowledged in their fields of
research. Newark itself does not have
a sophisticated public transport sys-
tem as London, but not to worry, UD
kindly lends the IC students' cycles
for the summer and provides cars for
weekend travels.
From a financial perspective you
will receive a total of $2000. UD pro-
vides a stipend of $1500 to live on,
and a sponsoring company (usually
Zeneca) contributes $500 towards
airfare. It's up to you how you spend
your money. You can blow it all and
end up using credit cards or even
come back with $700. However, you
will be strongly advised to take out
health insurance with an American
company, for just over $100, for the
time you are there. This is just in case
you happen to crack your knee during
ice-skating or need the odd root
canal. Believe us, American medical
health services can be horrendously
expensive. Although you can take out
insurance with British companies,
you will find you have to pay up front
(as much as $400) and claim the
money back once you get home,
which can put a strain on your bud-
get. However, with the US company
just show your certificate/documents
and the hospital, etc, will be happy to
claim the expenses on your behalf.
For the first 6 weeks you get on-
campus self-catering accommoda-
tion, in student halls, for the bargain
price of $400. Here each IC student is
paired up with a UD student who has
kindly offered to be your roommate,
and the two share a pretty decent
sized room. If you end up liking each
other, well then, that's a bonus. You
also get to meet and hang out with
other regular UD undergraduates,
who like yourselves will be doing
research over the summer. The final
two weeks involve homestay (for|
free) with an American family. This
bit is particularly good since you get
cooked meals and if you are really
nice the host will let you have parties
at their house!
This summer's five visiting schol-
ars were Stephen Cavanagh (Civil
UG4), Mohammed Matin (Mech.
Eng. UG4), Zeenab Razak (Materials
UG4), Kabilan Satyamoorthy
(Biochem UG3) and Sonia Volny-
Luraghi (Physics UG 4). Although
we were doing research throughout
the day, we were free to organise
social activities for evenings and
weekends with UD students. We
spent the 4th of July weekend in
Washington DC, camping in
Gettysburg (the civil war battlefield)
went to baseball games, day trips to
New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia.
Baltimore and the Beach, to name but
a few.
Anyone interested in applying for
the summer '97 scheme can get fur-
ther information/application forms
from the IC UROP office (Mech Eng
313C), or ask any one of thefiveIC
UD '96'students, and we would be
happy to help The deadline for appli
cations is 13th November and inter
views will be held on 20th November
1996. See you then! Good luck!

I'm Scared
I'm scared that you don't like me.
That I'm pushing you away,
And I'm too afraid to ask you,
Because I'm scared of what you'll
say.
I'm scared of being lonely,
And I'm scared to look at you,
In case you look the other way,
I'm scared of what I'll do.
I'm scared of wanting this too much,
I'm scared to feel the way I do,
And I'm too afraid to say,
That I'm scared of losing you.
