Dear Felix
Mr Foster, the Head of Catering
and Conference Services has been to
see me in person to answer my letter
about sandwiches. He says that the
Catering Department has to "pay its
way" and any trading surplus is rein-
vested; for example, two new chiller
cabinets will shortly be purchased for
QT so that a wider range of goods
can be displayed. Apparently the
sandwiches cannot be sold any
cheaper because of overheads and
the requirement to meet stringent
health and safety standards etc. There
are now three different suppliers of
sandwiches, the cheapest at 99p
(which now apparently includes egg
mayonnaise, which I saw for Â£1.10 in
QT last week).
Large companies like Boots can
often afford to offer "loss leaders"
and small shops like The Sandwich
Shop on Gloucester Road, who make
sandwiches on the premises, may
have lower overheads. Mr Foster
says that some sandwiches in the
Students' Union are on sale at higher
prices than in QT.
All I can suggest is that you shop
around.

A MATTER OF POLICY
A number of points have arisen from
last Tuesday's ICU Council Meeting
which I feel deserve some attention.
Firstly, there is the matter of
papers for Council meetings not
being available in time. At present,
and I must add that this has been the
situation for some time, it is unfortu-
nately the case that Council
Members are only given the papers
for a specific meeting at the start of
that meeting. This only gives them a
few minutes to peruse all the reports,
minutes and motions that have been
presented to Council, a function
which is, fundamentally, the role of
the Council. These motions are then
passed, often with only perfunctory
debate, when less hurried reading of
the papers would allow members to
raise valid and worthwhile points to
be discussed and voted upon.
The current practice abrogates the
role of Council, and thus invalidates
the entire democratic representative
process. The Council Members are
there for a reason: to represent vari-
ous sectors of the Imperial College
student community on the
"Sovereign Body of Imperial
College Union." They ought to be
given the opportunity to do this, and
a step forward would be to issue the
papers for such meetings in good
time. If this was the case, then there
would be much lesser cause for com-
plaint when 'controversial', badly
written or simply poor policies are
passed by a confused and under
informed body.
Before I raise the next point, let me
say that I, in common I'm sure with
the majority of student opinion, do
not particularly favour top-up fees as
a method of relieving the funding
pressures on higher education institu-
tions. However I do not share the
view of the ICU's Student Represen-
tative Council that Imperial College
Union needs a policy statement to
this effect.
The motion to adopt such a policy
presented to last Tuesday's Council
(available from the Union Office if
anyone is interested) contains much
that is laudable and sensible, has
valid supporting facts and figures
and reaches impressive conclusions.
It is however, entirely to no effect,
and I suggest, sends the wrong sig-
nals to the wrong people. All of the
instructions are already being fol-
lowed by the sabbaticals, so why the
need to mandate them to do so?
Furthermore, the motion is reac-
tive rather than proactive, confirming
established facts and measures
already implemented, and comes
only a few weeks before the next
budget. There is nothing therein to
instruct firm action, if that was the
intent of the motion (which could be
considered too little, too late in any
case), and if it was not intended,
what is the need for such a confirma-
tory piece of paper?
Restating established points, in a
document that has the faint whiff of
bandwagon about it, does not further
the IC students' cause, and makes
those who claim to represent them
seem somewhat late and reactionary.
Up to now, there hasn't been a need
for a policy, and nothing new was
presented here. If and when policy is
needed with regard to taking action
or spending money on such a cause,
then a mandate would be needed. But
until then, the current careful diplo-
macy, research and discussion would
seem to serve rather better.
CAREERS FAIR
On Wednesday the 13th of
November ICU plays host to this
years Careers Fair. If you're already
actively looking for a job, or you're
just interested in what's on offer in
the big wide world, then get on your
smart clothes, and check out the fair.
There will be 41 companies
attending, with vacancies in most
areas from finance to systems analy-
sis, via engineering and mathemat-
ics. This year we are proud to have
three major European companies
attending their first UK Careers Fair.
In addition to being able to meet
the Companies in person, we are also
offering an opportunity to find a
career online, with help from the
World Careers Network , who will
be in dBs. There will also be a stand
representing the IC Careers Service
in dBs, who will be able to offer you
careers advice. The Careers Service
will also be offering seminars on
good interview technique and the
best way to sell yourself using your
CV.
The Fair runs from 11am - 4pm,
and is open to undergraduates, grad-
uates & postgraduates.
Don't leave your future to chance,
