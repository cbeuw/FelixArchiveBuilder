The future of the world
ON TUESDAY, THE US WENT TO THE PRESIDENTIAL POLLS. BEFORE THE
DEWAYNE FRAZIER
The United States of America, as is
Great Britain, is nearing an election
for a leadership to embark upon the
next millennium. Come November
5th, Americans must decide who
serve as our president for the next four
years.
In the United States, elections are
more common than Manchester
United victories (sorry, this was writ-
ten a few weeks ago). In any given
year there are between 120 and 130
thousand elections. Most of these
elections are for local school boards,
but still this has an overwhelming
effect on voter turnout. This is basical-
ly 60% turnout for most major elec-
tions, and 40% for mid-terms, in con-
trast to the UK, which has a regular
70% turnout.
The point is that Americans don't
expect large turnouts, and I don't
anticipate that this year will be drasti-
cally different.
The Democratic candidate is
incumbent President Bill Clinton.
Clinton is from the small community
of Hope Arkansas, and prior to the
presidency held the Governorship of
Arkansas. His vice-presidential nomi-
nee is Al Gore of Tennessee.
Bill Clinton - Democrat
What do Franklin Delano Roosevelt
and John Fitzgerald Kennedy have in
common with William Jefferson
"Bill" Clinton? All three belong to
America's party of the people, the
Democrats.
Mr Clinton served as governor of
Arkansas for eight years before his
accession to the Presidency. His
track record was excellent. Arkansas
saw its job market flourish, and taxes
he has realised his dreams. President
Clinton's hometown holds strong
symbolic significance as well. He
truly is America's true visionary to
lead us into the next century.
Clinton has worked hard to reform
our welfare system, stop crime and
restore education. He is a young
charismatic leader, much like Tony
Blair. He believes the only way to
tackle the future is through common
fall - and the US has been no differ-
ent. You have to ask the question, as
an American, are we better off than
you were four years ago? Darn right
we are!
Mr Clinton was born in the tiny
city of Hope, Arkansas. Through
sheer hard work and determination
unity. Mr Clinton knows that if we
want to remain a world superpower,
unity is key.
So, come November 5th, people
will come out and vote for Bill
Clinton in vast numbers. His works
speak for him. Clinton is America's
vision for the next millennium.
A definite down side to Clinton re-
election campaign has been the attack
upon his moral character due to the
Whitewater investigation. Apparently
having attended Oxford proves that he
is highly intelligent.
The Republican candidate is former
Kansas senator Bob Dole.
Formerly serving as majority
leader in the US Senate, he
resigned in order to devote com-
plete effort to his election cam-
paign. His running mate is Jack
Kemp, from New York.

DEWAYNE FRAZIER
Democrat & Republican - why do
these words invoke cynicism in
America today?
Nearly a decade ago, Ronald
Reagan uttered these immortal words
"The worst eleven words in the
English Language are 'I am from the
government, and I am heretohelp".
Why is America so tired of business
as usual? Because gridlock and sta-
tus quo doesn't work.
America is ready for change, and
Ross Perot and his new Reform Party
is here. Mr Perot is an accomplished
millionaire. He is the embodiment of
the American dream - A boy who
worked hard and made his money
through blood, sweat and tears.
Mr Perot has set an agenda to take
care of our $6 000 000 000 000 debt.
Mr Perot made an analogy Ifindvery
effective. He said that if you have a
problem with a car, you don't call a
plumber, you call a mechanic. Thus
if you have problems with the econ-
omy you don't call for career politi-
cians, you get an accomplished busi-
ness man. Mr Perot will be able to
remedy the problem of this national
embarrassment that our generation is
receiving from our parents.
Ross Perot is of good moral char-
acter and is an upstanding citizen. He
would make an excellent leader that
our generation could look up to. In a
legacy of fallen heros, Mr Perot will
be a knight in shining armour.

ELECTION FELIX ASKED OUR AMERICAN STUDENTS FOR THEIR OPINIONS
Mr Dole stands in the public
eye as a citizen of good moral
values. But in today's America,
that that is definitely not enough.
Dole is very conservative on
social issues, and looks to re-
establish the family, whereas

RESULTS
In the end, it proved an easy victory,
for Bill Clinton, who became the
first Democrat infiftyyears to retain
the presidency.
Clinton swept across both the east
and west coast, taking thirty-two
states to Bob Dole's nineteen. The
electoral college vote, based on the
number of voters living in each
state, was even more dramatically in
Clinton's favour - he took 325 votes
to Dole's 214. However, he still
failed to take 50% of the popular
vote - and with less than half of the
electorate turning out, he may face
questions over his mandate to gov-
ern.
He will also face stiff opposition
from the continuing Republican
majorities in the Senate and House.
Clinton looks to redefine it. The prob-
lem with Mr Dole's campaign lies
with his age. Lacking in charisma and
energy, he is seen as a boring, stiff-
collar businessman.
The newly coined "Reform" party
is headed by Ross Perot. The party is
showing very low in the polls, and
looks not to be a force in US politics,
as was the case in the 1992 election.
In the previous election, President
Clinton captured only about 45% of
the votes. If he was to capture under
50% again this would be a landmark
in US political history - thefirstpres-
ident in US political history to win
two elections without receiving a pop-
ular mandate.
Sadly enough we live in the age of
mass media. Political figures live
under microscopes and their every
move is reported. Usually the bad is
reported to vastly overshadow the
good. I really feel that Americans are
dissatisfied with the upcoming elec-
tion. Due to media involvement, most
campaigns are largely a battle of mud-
slinging. When Americans want
issues to be debated it never seems to
happen. I think the best idea would be
to shorten election campaigns, to
make them similar to the length of
British campaigns. This - I hope -
would allow less mud slinging, and
more time spent debating.
The upcoming election looks to be
strongly in favour of Bill Clinton, with
analysists and polls alike showing a
gap of 15 - 20%. Sadly enough, the
disgust was summed up for me in a
quote from a friend of mine, who,
when asked who they would vote for
replied "I guess for Clinton, as
immoral as he is, I guess he's the best
man for the presidency".
Lack of values or just reality?
Bob Dole - Republican
other key
J E N N Y REISINGER
One of the most important issues in
this year's presidential election has
been government spending.
Presently, the US deficit is around $6
trillion. If the deficit isn't taken care
of in the next ten years, the United
States economy could face a com-
plete fallout and Generation X will
be left holding the bill.
Bob Dole and
Republicans have
presented several
proposals that
would help to
reduce the deficit
and balance the
budget in the next
seven years. Each
proposal was vetoed
by Bill Clinton who
has continued to
spend taxpayers'
money.
Bill Clinton
increased the taxes
for the rich in the
c o u n t r y .
Unfortunately, that
tax increase affect-
ed less than 5% of the United States
population, hardly enough to make a
difference in the country.
Bob Dole has presented a proposal
which will cut taxes over the next
several years and, at the same time,
cut the budget deficit, by cutting
enough government spending,
There are two distinct areas con-
cerning money that will need to be
looked at in the future if the govern-
ment wants to get the budget and the
deficit under control. First, the
Republicans want to reform Social
Security. After World War II, there
were a huge number of births in the
United States, most of whom will all
be retiring around the same time. The
system will not be able to handle the
great number of retirees and
Generation X will have to pay the
extra money. Bill Clinton and the
Democrats have dragged their feet .
The Republicans, however, have
suggested phasing out the Social
Security System without harming
those who have put money into the
system.
Secondly, Bill Clinton has
promised welfare reform. Bill
Clinton finally signed a welfare
reform bill in the last six months. The
welfare reform bill was written by
Republicans.
Bill Clinton may be young and
Bob Dole an old man but when it
comestopolicies affecting the young
people of the United States, Bill
Clinton acts as if he could care less
about our genera-
tion.
Sure, some say
Bob Dole is old
fashioned. Bob
Dole is old fash-
ioned in the sense
jf that he does what he
â€¢ says he will do. He
realises there are
problems in the
country and instead
of waiting for
someone to fix
them, he fixes
them. Bill Clinton
has done nothing to
make the country I
will inherit better.
The future for America will not be
a bright one if things don't start to
change now. Under Clinton, the only
changes that have been made have
been made by the Republicans in
Congress. Perhaps its time to put the
Republicans in the White House and
see what happens. After all, things
can only get better.
