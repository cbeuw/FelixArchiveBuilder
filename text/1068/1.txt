In his speech on Commemoration
Day, the Rector, Sir Ronald
Oxburgh, focused once again on the
lack of funding in Higher Education.
In particular, he pointed out hardship
faced by staff whose earnings have
been falling in real terms for over a
decade, and expressed his fear that
the quality of education was being
threatened, even at the best institu-
tions.
Figures published by the Times
Higher Education Supplement gave a
mixed picture to the financial scene
at Imperial College. IC has always
relied heavily upon funds from
industry, commerce and public cor-
porations. Last year was no exception
with an income of £6,216,000
obtained from those sectors, ranking
IC third overall, just below
Cambridge.
Some people expressed concern
that Cranfield University, which
topped the table, made most of their
money in areas specialised in by IC,
namely aeronautical engineering,
materials and biotechnology. Equally
worrying was that despite the enor-
mous amount of research carried out

at IC, the College had only been paid notably at the redbricks, which have
£218,000 for their intellectual prop- strong associations with wealthy
erty rights. local families, made a substantial
Endowments at other universities, contribution to their overall income.
This did not appear to be the case at
IC. The Rector's recent trip to Hong
Kong, where he met up with IC
alumni, had been described as "posi-
tive" by the PR officer, Lynda
Davies, and the College hoped more
support would come from that front
in the future.
Due to the comparatively small
number of students accommodated in
halls of residence, the College
received only £10 million in renting
rooms and catering, compared to sev-
eral times this for other institutions.
The shortage of space also limited
the income that could be generated
from conferences. However, with the
addition of the new BMS building on
the campus, it was expected that the
situation would improve.
Drawing attention to the acheive-
ments of the College's students, par-
ticularly the success enjoyed by
Imperial College Boat Club this sum-
mer at the Henley Regatta, Sir Ron
urged graduates to contribute enthu-
siastically to the funding for the
refurbishment and extension of the
boathouse. "I hope that anyone who
feels able to help will not feel hesi-
tant about letting me know."
To boycott or not to boycott...
N E W S T E A M
On Tuesday, Imperial College Union
Council backed away from advocat-
ing an all out boycott of the planned
new bookstore. A suggestion that IC
students should avoid any bookstore
that was not run by their Student's
Union was brushed aside, with one
sabbatical suggesting that the matter
should not even be debated.
The Council did however resolve
to seek "reparations" if the new
bookstore, which will replace the
current Walkway sited outlet, is run
by an external organisation. The
meeting also decided that the Union
should oppose "top-up fees", but
only in such a way as not to antago-
nise College administration.
Vacant positions on Council were
also open for nominations, with the
Treasurer of the Athletics Clubs
Committee being elected in his
absence as a postgraduate member.
The post of Welfare Officer remains
unfilled despite attempts to find a
candidate.
