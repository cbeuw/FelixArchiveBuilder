Clayponds security -
Residents demand value for money
Dear Editor,
As residents of Clayponds village
we would like to air our personal
views on the security problem and
address some of the issues that Mr
Caldwell raised in his letter last
week.
The claim that Mr Caldwell and
his colleagues are listening to the
Clayponds community is true, but
unfortunately it's going in one ear
and out of the other. Take the recent
meeting at Clayponds hospital, in our
opinion an unmitigated farce It's our
recollection, as indeed Mr Caldwell
states, that nothing was ruled out but
equally nothing was ruled in (status
quo?). In fact as far as we can
remember every idea proposed from
the floor met with a myriad of nega-
tive responses as to why that security
measure would be wholly inappro-
priate for Clayponds. The two
favourites were (1) bars on windows
- obviously an excellent idea used on
basement flats throughout London
(2) deadlocks - likewise an excellent
idea recommended by insurance
companies and crime prevention
officers. Remarks by Mr Caldwell
about "Alcatraz" speak for them-
selves. The range of excuses for not
fulfiling these measures beggared
belief. In fact you'd wonder how the
companies that sell them ever man-
aged to stay in business if there were
such great associated fire (and other)
hazards.
We are fed up to the back teeth
with the lack of vision, the short term
reactionary measures, incompetence
(keys?) and worst of all the blase atti-
tude that seems to pervade i.e. a
determined intruder will get in any-
way so security investments are a
waste of time. "Somebody has to pay
for it" and we already are thank you
very much, in the form of regular
break-ins and soaring insurance pre-
miums. The questionnaire was tanta-
mount to an admission that security
measures need to be taken but
Estates aren't prepared to pay for
them. Why else would you ask us if
we would accept a rent rise to pay for
security upgrades'?
As for our new carpets Mr
Caldwell, they're very nice thank
you very much. You might be inter-
ested to know however, that the
"old" carpets in our houses had years
left in them, still there you go.
Lastly the dog patrols are a very
good idea. Full marks to whoever
thought of that one. However on the
down side the guard appears to spend
most of his time sat in his van and
therefore it wouldn't take very long
to work out his patrol pattern would
it? Ever seen "The Great Escape" ?
Mr Caldwell also neglected to men-
tion that these security patrols are at
present, only a temporary measure.
No prizes for guessing the innovative
way in which this scheme will be
financed if and when it becomes per-
manent.
Yours sincerely,
Adrian Bennett & Nick Stock
Dear Editor,
As a resident of Garden Hall, I
have been worried to read in recent
issues of Felix that dead-locks are
considered to be a fire safety hazard,
as all Garden Hall rooms are fitted
with one. However, following recent
fire drills the dead-locks posed no
problems to escaping residents. I
therefore wondered whether the safe-
ty of Clayponds residents is a higher
priority than that of Garden Hall res-
idents, or whether this is simply a
case of double standards?
Yoursfaithfully,
A Cherrington
Dear Editor,
I am writing in response to Mr
Caldwell's letter in last weeks Felix
concerning the 'impressions' given
about Clayponds security. As a long
standing resident of the afore-men-
tioned establishment, I was rather
insulted by some of the throw-away
comments made in Mr Caldwell's
letter. 'Some students even liked the
new carpets!!' for instance. Well of
course we like the carpets. That, Mr
Caldwell, is not the point.
The issue here, which you and Mr
Daniels seem to gloss over at every
opportunity, is one of priorities. I am
not disputing the fact that some of the
carpets were in need of replacement.
However, if 160 grand can be found
for this purpose, then 40 more seems
a small price to pay for decent locks
on front doors.
We have also heard through the
grapevine that we are to get a com-
mon room costing in excess of
Â£40000.1 don't remember ever being
consulted about this. If you tried ask-
ing ALL of the students where they
think the money should be spent,
locks or TV lounge, I think you
might find the solution to your prob-
lems regarding the funding of securi-
ty upgrades. You will of course tell
me that both carpets and common
room are from separate grants. Fine,
well how about trying to raise some
cash for security upgrades? I am able
to break into my own house in under
one minute without breaking any
windows or door frames. If you
would like a demonstration of this, I
would be only to happy to oblige.
One last point, although there
could be many more, what exactly
are the 'fire-safety implications' of
putting deadlocks on doors? Are you
seriously trying to tell readers that
your own residence, or for that mat-
ter virtually every other home in the
country, is not fitted with a decent
lock? Stop trying to fob us off with
feeble excuses. Fulfil the College's
obligations as landlord by making
sure that we have British Standards
approved deadlocks on the doors.
Yours sincerely,
Andrew Payne
The residents (ie those who are
paying for Clayponds to be run,
secured, and covered in new car-
pet) would appear to be of one
mind. Mr Caldwell (who is also
paid by the students for that mat-
ter) please note.
Gun Lobby states the
case for the defence
Dear Editor,
We are writing to correct the letter
"Dunblane Answer" (Felix 1067).
Whilst we respect the views of
Richard Sandiford, his letter indi-
cates a poor appreciation of the facts.
He should have re-read the article.
It clearly explains that Lord Cullen's
report concluded that a complete ban
on handguns is a totally unnecessary
step, and the proposals of his report
would provide ample security in the
future. The government seems to
have forgotten what it means to gov-
ern, and has instead succumbed to
the press induced hysteria that has
rendered balanced argument impos-
sible.
As to the point about the difficulty
of pronouncing someone dangerous
or safe, in cases where someone is
seriously unbalanced, the person will
not instantly collapse into such a
state, but will reach this level after a
more gradual loss of faculties. The
law, bolstered by the proposals of the
Cullen Report, and aided by the
shooters themselves would deny
access to firearms for anyone consid-
ered to be in anyway unsuitable.
Whilst it is never possible to be com-
pletely sure about someone's mental
state, those connected with shooting
always favour caution, and will
never give the benefit of the doubt.

But surely the law has always been
intended to deny access to
firearms from psychopaths - yet
Thomas Hamilton still obtained a
firearms licence. Of course, those
who really want access to guns will
always be able to obtain them ille-
gally - but if Hamilton had been
forced to break into a gun club or
a armoury, it might have given the
police a slightly higher chance of
catching him before he murdered
so many innocent children.
Letters may be edited for length.
The guest editor's opinions

fication. Letters may be e-mailed
