IC Rugby - Comeback Kids leave it
slightly too late
WILLIAM B E A U M O N T
FELIX RUGBY CORRESPONDENT
Egged on by a large vocal crowd, IC
nearly stole a victory from under the
noses of Royal Holloway. Just as in
all the previous matches IC's superi-
or fitness was clearly evident and
once again the honour of the final
score was ours. What's more is that
this last 20 mins of barnstorming
play was into a devilish wind which
would have proved a serious test to
any sides resolve. What is called for
now is for the effort shown in the last
quarter to be sustained for the entire
match - then the opposition will sure-
ly suffer. Plus points from the game
were improvements in the lineout
and defence.
A healthy fixture list sees IC
embarking on a concentrated period
of rugby, with forays into the
Gutteridge League and Cup. Next
week IC take on the medics of Royal
Free, and on November 16th we play
the old boys at Harlington.
Honour was bestowed on the club
when Jack Pearl and Ollie Lyttleton
were selected for the ULU squad.
Congratulations all.
Seconds take on thirds in IC derby
The points were quick to flow. After
five minutes, the threes capitalised
on a twos breakdown and Tom com-
pleted a 15 man effort to overturn
twos possession, scoring in the cor-
ner. A tad aggravated, the twos
began a tough fight against humilia-
tion. For the first-half, against the
wind little progression poured forth,
and the thirds showed strength and
honourable work. Just before half-
time a little luck was beset upon the
seconds, with Kolone the ever reli-
able winger rectifying the balance.
The second half was slightly more
disciplined, with an end to end battle
for forty minutes. The only break-
through came from The Viking, his
first for IC. After a tremendous roar
and an Icelandic muttering the play
picked up to the standard expected of
the seconds.
In summary, the final score was
10-5. The thirds played superbly, and
the final score was unrepresentative
of their effort.
Football fourths pick up the pieces
After last weeks disastrous Saturday,
IC Fourths were happy to draw three
a piece, despite leading by two goals
against a UCL team one division
higher than themselves, and only
goalkeeping errors and defensive
blunders cost the team a vital three
points which would have confirmed
the team's position in the next round
of the National Cup.
In the second game, also against a
UCL side a league game against the
UCL Fifths, IC dissapointingly drew
one-one, again after surrendering the
lead. An off-form, under-strength
team played poorly in the first-half,
though as many chances were wast-
ed in the second-half by our main
strikers it must be seen as two points
lost rather than one point gained.
Both games were very scrappy,
with Ken making many tackles
which would not have been out of
place on a rugby field. He was lucky
not to have his name taken by the ref-
eree, to add to that of the keeper.
Steve almost had an early bath for
retaliation, after being assaulted by
the right winger, but Sion Pale
inflamed the situation further, by
having a spat with a full-back who
was built like a brick latrine, though
he withdrew prematurely from the
position, after only fifteen seconds.
Thankfully, there was Darren,
Chris and Dimitri on Wednesday,
and Pistol (never fires a blank) Pete
on Saturday to score the goals and
protect the innocent. Only a slightly
controversial match-report this time,
so roll on Wednesday....
Promising start
for volleyball
This week of BUSA volleyball was
a first for the newly formed female
team of volleyball in IC. It implied a
"do-what-we-can" attitude against a
strong and well balanced side from
UCL. But they take pride in their
display; it was never over for UCL
leading for a harsh scoreline in the
second set. It ended up 15/11 15/3 -
hopefully they can do better in the
away match to be played in a fort-
night.
For the boys, it was a bit easier; a
two set to nil victory was well
deserved after a close defeat last
week. An impressive display in the
attack (to quote the ref, "You played
really well") made it really difficult
for UCL to respond. The whistle
blew with the score 15/11 15/9 -
well done IC. Just one question
remained; how was it that in four
teams, out of fourty players, there
was only one Englishman, and he
went to the French Lycee?
Winners from
start to finish
What can I say? We were amazing,
QMW were a quality team, but no
match for the all conquering sec-
onds. The first goal, by Rich Brunt,
resulted from the usual IC pressure
at the beginning of the game. IC
pressed for a second goal, but it
wouldn't come. QMW finally got
their act together towards the end of
the half. Luckily, their finish was
appalling.
The second-half started with even
more IC pressure, resulting in a
knock in for Rich. The game then
confined itself to the QMW half, as
IC became very dominant as the
opposition began to decompose.
After a few goal saving moves by
the defence, IC again found their
killer touch as Goran piledrived the
ball into the back of the net. Bill did
his customary clumsy tackle, floor-
ing an opponent. But IC were so
superior that QMW seemed to be
playing like a bunch of art students.
