Detective Inspector Dog – Mission: Malaria
Recent research from Durham University has identified a promising new method of malarial detection, that may
assist or even replace current laboratory methods – sniffer dogs.

70% accuracy
identifying
infected
individuals
and 90%
accuracy for
uninfected
ones”
D
ogs are often
considered to
be man’s best
friend. This
relationship has persisted
for millennia, with our
canine pals taking roles
such as bomb detection
agents, sheep herders,
nannies and of course,
companions. The role
of dogs in global health
includes the early de-
tection of many human
diseases, such as cancers
and Parkinson’s disease.
Researchers from Durham
University have demon-
strated that we may soon
be able to use trained dogs
to detect another globally
important disease – ma-
laria, which has important
implications for the future
treatment and survival of
infected individuals.
People infected with
malaria produce a distinct
scent. The researchers set
out to test whether dogs,
with their incredibly sen-
sitive noses, can smell this
and therefore diagnose
infected individuals. This
study was undertaken
on a sample of school
children in The Gambia
– an endemic region for
malaria. The children
gave blood samples for
laboratory detection and
provided socks they had
worn overnight for scent
detection by trained
sniffer dogs. Compared
to laboratory detection,
which is considered 100%
accurate, the dogs had
70% accuracy identifying
individuals with the in-
fection and 90% accuracy
identifying those without.
For a preliminary,
“proof of concept” study
this level of accuracy is
very exciting, particularly
as the dogs were capable
of identifying malaria
much faster and more cost
effectively than labora-
tory detection methods.
However, the researchers
note that more studies are
required for us to better
appreciate the extent to
which sniffer dogs can
be used for diagnosing
this disease. Future work
will involve expanding
the sampling effort
beyond The Gambia to
other endemic regions.
These studies will also
include training the dogs
to identify the multiple
stages of malarial in-
fection – each of which
produces a different scent
intheinfectedperson.This
is a factor that could have
led to an underestimation
of the dog’s accuracy in
this study.
The researchers believe
that with more training
and more samples, the
dogs could reach an
accuracy equal to current
laboratory methods. Lab-
oratory detection requires
blood collection and in-lab
blood screening, using
sniffer dogs is a faster
and non-invasive method.
The dogs were capable of
detecting malaria rapidly,
even at very low levels
of infection. This is nec-
essary for early detection
and treatment which
greatly improves survival
odds and decreases trans-
mission risk.
Malaria is indisputably
one of the greatest killers
of our time. Nearly half of
today’s human population
is at risk of infection,
and of the hundreds of
thousands of people that
die from the disease
each year, the majority
are children under the
age of five. However,
our progress in the
fight against the disease
has recently suffered a
setback, with the number
of malarial infections and
deaths on the rise for the
first time in many years
– potentially due to drug
resistant strains. That said,
the Durham study shows
promise in the continued
fight and may prove to
be a critical tool in the
elimination and eradica-
tion of malaria in all its
remaining strongholds.

Fear is in the Air

H
ow old should
one be to watch
Harry Potter?
What about
The Hunger Games? Or
Transformers? So far,
age ratings for movies
depended on subjective
opinions.
However, researchers at
the Max Planck Institute
for Chemistry in Mainz
suggested that we could
base the age classification
on the isoprene concen-
tration in the air inside
cinemas.
Scientists used ventila-
tion systems in cinemas
to measure the air
composition during 135
screenings of 11 movies.
They analysed relations
between the current age
rating of a given film and
concentrations of 60 com-
pounds. One pheromone
stood out: the level of
isoprene highly correlated
with the age classification
determined by the Volun-
tary Self Regulation of
the Movie Industry. This
means that the higher the
suggested minimal age for
a given movie, the more
isoprene the audience
releases.
Scary movie scenes
provoke involuntary
movements. As we tense
our muscles or wriggle
nervously, we release
isoprene, an organic
compound found in the
muscle tissue. “Isoprene
appears to be a good indi-
cator of emotional tension
within a group,” suggests
Jonathan Williams, the
leader of the research
team. We can use this
knowledge to predict how
stressful a given movie
might be for different age
groups.
Now the scientists from
the Max Planck Institute
plan to study if we can use
air composition to deter-
mine the level of emotions
other than nervousness.
To achieve this, they need
to move their research
to laboratories, because
movies tend to provoke a
variety of emotions in a
short amount of time, so
released chemical com-
pounds probably mix in
the air.
“Our approach could
therefore provide an
objective criterion for
deciding how movies
should be classified,”
adds Williams. Next
time you watch a horror
movie, sniff around: it’s
not popcorn, it’s literally a
smell of fear.
