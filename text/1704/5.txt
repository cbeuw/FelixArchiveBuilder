Gritty unwinds the American midterms
Okay - look here. This is a fucking travesty, and anyone who tries to convince me otherwise
is counterrevolutionary scum. At the same time, there are ‘some’ reasons to be hopeful. The
pessimism is really destroying my liver. And the union ain’t cheap, either!

Gritty
Left Forum Chair
I
t the Grit. The mid-
terms have come and
gone, and the balance
of power has shifted.
Races have been won and
lost. Pour a 40 out for my
dudes Gillum, O’Rourke
(3-point spread), Janz, and
Abrams (~2 point spread).
Good showing all.
The Dems picked up
34 seats in the House,
clinching the majority.
Ocasio-Cortez, 29, won
78% of her district, and
is the youngest woman
ever elected to Congress.
Suburban areas that swung
Romney to Clinton and
Obama to Trump (mostly
suburban whites) in 2012-
2016 turned out big for
the Dems and produced a
few center-leaning Bolts
from the Blue (Max Rose
etc). Progressive candi-
dates overperformed their
expectations; the neo-libs
fell somewhat short (fuck
yeah, fuck you!). This
paves a path towards
electoral strategy in 2020
and cements Sanders’
status as frontrunner for
the presidency, as one of
the few realistic candidate
prospects, and the only
one with name-brand
recognition. And the lack
of legislative power due
to no Senate control opens
the field to pie-in-the-sky
resolutions that progres-
sives excel at writing.
Republicans picked up
3 Senate seats; Dems won
21 Senate races, versus 9
on the R side. Dems held
in Trump-voting states
(e.g. Manchin in WV).
Nelson (D-Fl) lost his
seat, unfortunately. This
is bad news if a third
SCOTUS pick comes
around before 2020 (hold
onto yer assholes). The
legislative agenda is
stymied so long as Dems
hold one chamber of
Congress, though.
The Govie races are
decent, too. Scott Walker
got the boot (maybe now
the wall). Pickups in
R-leaning states (Kansas,
Nevada, Michigan) feed
the cause. Dems picked
up nine governorships
overall. Abrams’s election
is contestable; Kemp
still has some answers to
provide for his conduct
during the Georgia races -
he’s overseen the election
and the count. A rebuke
from a higher power is
possible down the road.
Redistricting will aid
the 2020 campaign - a
strategy the Republicans
have abused for some
time, and which requires
rectification. Fuck you,
assholes!
Unfortunately, LA
voted down Measure
B. The measure would
have allowed the city
to establish a munici-
pal bank - suitable for
managing infrastructure
projects without vomiting
away ludicrous sums
in interest payments to
corporate banking. The
North Dakotan municipal
bank is a suitable example
of such a scheme, and has
served the state well.
Florida voted up
a state-constitutional
amendment giving
felons the right to vote
(and a whole bunch of
ill-conceived limits on
tax hikes). This is a key
left victory; voters have
historically been wiped
from voting rolls in pro-
gressive-heavy districts;
this is a direct rebuke of
voter suppression tactics
and will seriously affect
the outcome of the 2020
election.
The House victory is
huge. Dems now have a
big stick to beat Trump
with. Ways and Means
can grab his tax returns;
memos will be released
(fuck you, Nunes!). The
60 or so subpoenas of the
administration Gowdy
and the Rs have shot down
will go forward. Schiff is
gonna do some wrecking.
Obstructionism, folks - if
it worked during Obama
I sure fucking hope it’s
gonna work now. Can’t
wait to watch Trump
negotiate with the Dems
when he was willing
to shut down his own
fucking government.
Oh, hey, also - Jeff
Sessions resigned. Thank
fuck. The only Confed-
erate monument Trump
was willing to take down.
Hope he talks to Mueller.
Too bad there’s no chance
of him being reincarnated
back-in-time so he can
die a painful death as a
Confederate on the battle-
field. Hey, Jeff - eat your
own dick, you heartless,
honourless bastard.
And now, the real
deal spiel. We still have
Schumer and Pelosi to
contend with. They will
be the first to be disposed
of when I come to power.
Neoliberalism ought to
sit in a corner and die a
quiet painful death. They
fucked up 2016 and 2014
before that and 2012
before that and everything
since Blair said “We’re
Thatcherites” before that.
Bill Clinton goes to the
guillotine of irrelevance
in my book. We’re not out
of the woods yet. Centrist,
compromising, spineless,
assholes, the kinds who
don’t live by the bible
they preach from are the
real problem here. The
John Kerries of the world,
mooring their yachts
where they don’t have to
pay tax while telling the
middle (which doesn’t
really exist in the US) and
lower classes to bear just
a bit more of the burden
oughta be publicly outed
and routed - these people
are assholes. Soul-sucking
shitty assholes. Give them
the fucking boot in 2020;
run primary challenges
and take these people to
task. Or else we will not
survive to 2024.
I don’t mean to make
the Dems winning out as
a good thing. Let me reit-
erate - they are damn near
the fucking worst. At least
they aren’t Republicans.
And I for one await the
sweet, sweet day when
they’re all dropped out
of a helicopter. Someday
we’ll have meaningful
governance, I trust. I hope
to live to see the day. Or
else we’re all dead.
