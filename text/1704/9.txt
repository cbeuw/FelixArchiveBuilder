his year marks
100 years since
the Armistice
that ended the
horrors of World War
I. The war was big and
affected many, and shortly
after, people began using
red poppies as symbols
of remembrance. It was
a way of honouring the
men lost as well as rein-
forcing the idea that war
could never happen again.
Unfortunately, World War
I was not the war to end
all wars as many more
took place. For some
of these wars, such as
World War II, the public
knew that fighting was
necessary to overcome
evil ideology. For others,
however, such as the Iraq
and Afghanistan wars, the
reasons for why fighting
was necessary were more
uncertain.
Whether it be on the
tube, in the shops, or
turning on the TV, the
red symbol seems to be
everywhere, and inci-
dentally lots of money
has found their way into
the coffers of the British
Legion. This charity
“works to ensure that
the people of the United
Kingdom remember all
those who have lost their
lives on active service to
the Crown, and honours
the service of the Armed
Forces and veterans,
and the contribution
of their families – our
beneficiary community.”
This statement begs three
questions. Firstly, why
does the British Legion,
and thereby the red poppy,
onlycommemorateBritish
servicemen and women?
Surely in a multicultural
society, we should not
differentiate a man from
Birmingham who has lost
his life in battle to a man
from Barcelona doing the
same thing. Secondly, war
in the present day kills
many more civilians than
it does members of the
armed forces. Why does a
soldier from Birmingham
killed in battle deserve
more commemoration
than a young girl from
Baghdad who suffered
the same fate? Finally,
why does the British
Legion not denounce war
or have even the slightest
notion of peace in their
statement? The answers
to these questions are
simple: nationalism, pride
and politics.
Recent events have
caused, and been caused
by, a rise in toxic nation-
alism where people are
lead to believe that Britain
is the most important
country, that Britain must
come first. The poppy has
come to be a badge of this
nationalism, and those
who don’t wear it, for
whatever reason, are seen
to be insulting British
values. As every public
figure pins this symbol
of Britishness onto their
clothes in fear of angering
the public, some take
the brave step and leave
out the poppy from their
public appearances.
This year, Manchester
United player Nemanja
Matic refused to wear
the poppy on his chest
during a match against
Bournemouth. Many were
enraged by his disrespect
of fallen servicemen; the
player believes that the
British bombs dropped on
his village in Serbia as a
child pose a much greater
disrespect.
This current climate of
“poppy fascism”, a term
coined by journalist Jon
Snow, who refuses to
wear a poppy on air, must
stop. The expectation
that everyone must wear
a poppy waters down the
whole idea of remem-
brance. What was once a
period of reflection which
meant something different
to each person has been
hijacked and politicized
into an attempt to promote
the British armed forces as
a whole. Some politicians
such as conservative MP
Maria Caulfield will call
out others for not wearing
ing them onto a charity.
However, when consider-
ing how the symbol of the
red poppy has changed,
many do not feel comfort-
able with it: this is where
the white poppy comes
in. Finding its beginnings
in the 1930s, when mili-
taristic rhetoric started to
rise up again in Britain,
this symbol promotes
peace. The Peace Pledge
Union (PPU) which
runs the campaign states
that: “There are three
elements to the meaning
of white poppies: they
represent remembrance
for all victims of war, a
commitment to peace and
a challenge to attempts
to glamorise or celebrate
war.” This seems a much
more compassionate
approach to remembrance
and more comprehensive-
ly represents the views
of our modern society.
This campaign has gained
traction in recent years,
with St Johns ambulance
service allowing it’s em-
ployees to wear it for the
first time and the National
Union of Teachers
promoting it in schools.
White poppies are still
nowhere near as common
as their red counterparts
and many see them as
an insult to the British
Legions and the families
of veterans.
A hundred years ago
the Armistice was called
and the never ending war
ended. A hundred years
ago we said never again.
Today we must remember
the fallen and honour that
pledge of peace. As the
red poppy moves further
and further away from this
view, for many, the white
poppy has become the
obvious successor.

“For some,

red poppies but then
consistently support the
use of UK military forces
in combat operations
overseas. For them, the
poppy serves as a way to
keep the romance of war
alive. The fallen service-
men from Iraq might be
heroes, but was the war
heroic? Some soldiers
who have returned to
the UK have actually
shown opposition to the
poppies. For example, in
2010 a group of veterans
accused the Poppy Appeal
of becoming too extreme,
denouncing it’s use to
rally support for military
campaigns.
It is clear that honour-
ing veterans is important,
one might even consider
a more robust welfare
system instead of offload-
