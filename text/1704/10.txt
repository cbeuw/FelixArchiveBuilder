European museum of the year resting on its
laurels
While showcasing its image as a champion of equality, development and growth, the Design
Museum’s actions implicitly show us that perhaps that’s not quite the case

I
n May of this year,
the design museum,
that resides a mere
15-minute walk
away from our South
Kensington campus, won
the award for European
museum of the year. Sat
between a Byron burgers
and the peacocks of
Holland park, it became
the 7th British museum to
do so in the 41 years that
the prize has been given
out.
Just a few months
later the museum came
under scrutiny for
hosting an event for
the Italian aerospace
and defence industry
giant Leonardo. This
culminated in a third of
the works being pulled
from the exhibition
Hope to Nope, which
was taking place in the
museum at the time.
The exhibition was
showcasing political
posters from the past ten
years, and many of the
artists felt that the spirit
of their work, much of
which was supporting
peace and denouncing
weapons manufacturing,
was being completely
trampled on by the
museum’s actions. The
situation ended with
the museum waiving
the entry fee for the
remaining duration of
the exhibition.
It seems like being
out of touch is becoming
a theme for the museum,
though, as I was able
to experience first hand
last weekend at the
Beazley designs of the
year exhibition. The
exhibition offers many
exquisite designs, and
is quite the inspirational
way to spend an
afternoon. It starts off
with designs promoting
e n v i r o n m e n t a l
sustainability, and then
weaves its way through
many different areas
of design, from fancy
clothes and glow-in-
the-dark plants to the
hyperloop. The message
that I felt the museum
was trying to push was
one of progressive
design. All the proper
buzzwords were there,
and some of the most
daring designs truly
were boundary-pushing
and promised to benefit
society. In the fashion
section, there were
clothes from a Spanish
fashion designer
who made an entire
collection for men using
traditionally female
elements, as well as a
fashion line that was
completely unisex. Both
pieces told a story of
blurring lines between
the genders, and how
a more fluid fashion
landscape might help
with gender-related
discrimination.
A few metres on was
a display case featuring
care packages from
Choose Love, a website
allowing people to buy
resources for refugees,
hoping that an approach
where a donation results
in a tangible object
being given directly to
a refugee will spur on
more people to donate.
Imagine my surprise
when I saw, right next to
the Choose Love display
case, displays showing
off the Qatari national
library and the Abu
Dhabi Louvre. Both of
LGBT+ community and
women in the Emirates
and Qatar is widely
known, but there is a
much larger problem
with featuring their
designs. Both of these
projects were reported
to be built on modern
slave labour, including
reports by Amnesty
International and
Human Rights Watch. It
is also extremely ironic
that the main sponsor
of the exhibition,
Beazley insurance, has
a disclaimer about not
supporting slave labour
at the bottom of their
website.
I don’t know whether
the solution is to remove
these designs from the
exhibition. But showing
off a pretty time-lapse
of the construction of
the Louvre does not
tell the whole story.
Perhaps someone can
make it an art project
to superimpose a death
count of mistreated
migrant workers,
with their passports
confiscated and their
lives in disarray, onto
the video, and send that
to the design museum.

these are fundamentally
at odds with the
