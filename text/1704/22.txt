Mamma Mia! Stories of motherhood
W
e begin
Stories with
what might
easily be
a first date. Felix (Sam
Troughton), an art col-
lector, has invited Anna
(Claudia Blakley) to his
flat. He’s bought flowers
and babbles about the
newest watercolours he’s
acquired with cringe-in-
ducing nervousness. Anna
haltingly tries to make
small talk in an attempt to
pierce the oppressive rind
of awkward tension that’s
growing between the two.
It’s clear both of them are
desperate just to get on
with it. Felix shows Anna
to the bedroom, but he
won’t be joining her – he’s
headed to the bathroom
with porn loaded on his
phone. Wait, what? We
quickly learn that this is
no ordinary date: Anna
intends to get pregnant
before the evening is up,
Felix is her sperm donor.
As Felix heads off
stage into the bathroom,
and Anna to the bedroom,
playwright and director
Nina Raine’s hilarious,
heartbreaking play
unfurls, plunging us
into the circumstances
that have led its heroine
to this moment. We
learn that newly-single
Anna, pushing forty, has
embarked on a quest in
which she will do practi-
cally anything to become
a mother.
As the play goes on
and Anna’s chances of
becoming a mother seem
ever slimmer, a lesser
playwright might’ve let
the script sag into maudlin
self-pity. Instead, Raine
offers a fine balance of
tears and laughter; no
other play has made me
laugh out loud as hard or
as often.
In the intimate setting
of the Dorfman’s stripped
down stage, Blakley and
Troughton take Raine’s
incisive, wonderfully nat-
uralistic dialogue and run
with it. Troughton is each
of the characters inAnna’s
revolving cast of potential
baby-daddies: exes,
colleagues, fantastically
egotistical theatre direc-
tors. Game for anything
and armed with enviable
comedic chops, he is
winning in all his incar-
nations. Blakley’s Anna
is a charming, complex,
sometimes not altogether
sympathetic woman. She
is yearning, but also,
thrillingly, a little ruthless.
It is a tremendous, vulner-
able performance.
Beyond a straightfor-
ward tale of one woman’s
struggle to conceive,
Raine’s wonderfully
incisive creation seeks to
interrogate the stories we
tell ourselves about our
own lives. Where do these
conceptions about how
our life will turn out come
from? To what lengths
will we go to live the life
we planned for ourselves?
Who are we willing to
hurt in the process? In
doing so she includes
a thoughtful aside on
the ethics of conceiving
with anonymous sperm
donors.
This gifted cast and
playwright have crafted
a smart, poignant take on
female agency, and the
difficult choices facing
many women today.
Videogames: Design/ Play/ Disrupt
O
ften dismissed
as an idle
p a s t i m e ,
v i d e o g a m e s
have a bad rep. It is thus
exciting that the V&A has
dedicated three halls to its
large feature exhibition
Videogames: Design/
Play/Disrupt. This is a
wide-ranging exhibition
looking at videogames
as a creative form, a
sociopolitical tool, and a
collaborative activity.
The videogames of
today have come a long
way since Tetris or Pong.
Technological advance-
ment has allowed the
incorporation of ever
more elaborate art, strat-
egies and concepts into
games. The first room,
Design, explores the
creative process of game
designers, and the inter-
esting concepts that are
emerging in new games.
Going against the idea
that videogames make
one antisocial, Journey
aims to encourage col-
laboration and empathy.
Players go on a journey
across undulating land-
scapes before climbing
a mountain and reaching
the summit. There is an
emotions chart on display,
where designers have
used different colours and
motifs to chart the emo-
tional journey a player
makes as they progress
in the game. The graphics
are beautiful, and the play
interesting in its focus on
atmosphere rather than
plot or strategy.
The exhibition show-
cases the immense effort
and great detail that go
into game design. In de-
veloping survival adven-
ture game The Last of Us,
actors wore a suit studded
with motion sensors in
order to model the move-
ments of protagonist Ellie
realistically in the game.
Artificial intelligence was
employed to model the
variety of Ellie’s respons-
es to Joel (the player’s
role), depending on what
the player does. From
intricate environmental
studies to detailed char-
acter modelling, many of
these games are complex
works of art.
The second room,
Disrupt, explores how
videogames have been
political. Just like films or
books, games have been
censored. Phone Story
is a commentary on ex-
ploitative manufacturing
practices of the mobile
phone industry, and was
removed from Apple’s
app store. A Series of
Gunshots is a disturbing
game where whenever
the player hits the button,
a random window lights
up in the building on
the screen, signifying a
gunshot and a victim.
Because videogames
are participatory, such a
response can be elicited to
criticize the ambivalence
shown towards gunshots
in the community, as long
as it does not hit ourselves.
Men are more asso-
ciated with videogames
than women, and within
games, sexism is rife.
Female characters are
often romantic or sexual
interests, dressed sugges-
tively and not very clever.
Anita Sarkeesian explores
this on her YouTube series
Trope Vs Women, which
is shown here. The variety
of games in this room and
their myriad issues raised
is truly illuminating.
In the final room, one
is treated to a huge screen
which show short clips
that represent the gaming
community, such as Mi-
necraft players coming
together to recreate their
game in real life. Do
not make the mistake of
spending too much time
in the first two rooms,
interesting as they are – it
is in the final room where
the quirky arcade games
are, along with creative
new party games.
Videogames is an im-
pressive and thoroughly
enjoyable snapshot of the
videogames industry and
community today, and
is a must-see for anyone
interested in art, graphic
design, and, of course,
videogames.
