Incongruous and fun: get yourself Insta-glamorous and make your way to the Southbank Centre for an enjoyable
hour at their latest exhibition, Space Shifters. Take Calum Drysdale’s MirrorTestTM
to see if you’re ready.
Another week, another
date and another gallery.
I got invited to go and
see the newish Space
Shifters exhibition by an
old friend last Sunday. I
was running late and was
rushing due to a highly
improbable coincidence
involving a Sunday lunch
and planned engineering
works. I had radioed
ahead from the impossi-
bly slow Upminster train
telling her to go on in and
that I would catch her up.
All this meant that when
I arrived I didn’t do the
usual straight-legged,
cross-armed stroll around
the exhibits but instead
dashed through the rooms
looking for the old friend,
barely registering what
was around me.
I include the mental
notes I made. “Big box
thing, twisty mirror,
dangly metal things and
blokes walking around
with bedroom mirrors
strapped to their chests”.
Indeed, the mix of my
hurrying and my last
minute reading up on the
gallery website about how
the exhibition explored
“boundaries” proved to
be fatal when I reached
a completely ordinary
velvet rope barrier and
I stopped to think about
how to get over it without
damaging the art. I came
to my senses, phoned date,
and we went back to the
beginning and strolled.
The exhibition brings
together a load of artists
to “investigate space”,
and, though I cannot
help but sneer, this was
fun to go along to. The
exhibition takes the form
of a gauntlet of interactive
and non-interactive (signs
everywhere warn parents
to keep their children on
the leash) pieces. The
hour-long stroll was like
a walk-through Oz. From
our yellow brick road we
saw all sorts of shiny and
plasticy things.
The effect was largely
“The hour-
long stroll was
like a walk-
through Oz”
“Reflective
bowling balls
like edible
cupcake
sprinkles”
successful, though it was
sometimes hard to avoid
the comparison to the
strangest IKEA ever or
an updated children’s soft
play area, missing only
the rollers and the smell
of piss.
Effort had clearly been
made to make the whole
thing very photogenic
and Instagramable. The
“dangly metal things”
were in fact sheets of
silvery chains that hung
from the ceiling down to
about waist height, en-
closing half of a ramp and
mezzanine. The effect was
pretty and I would have
spent more time thinking
about what the artist had
been trying to do had
the whole thing not been
packed out with people
trying to get the perfect
picture. No sarky one-lin-
er will do to describe the
guilty parties. It seems
that polished metal links
are what it takes to get
anyone from parties of
slightly artsy schoolgirls,
to Eastern European male
tourists in tight trousers, to
helicopter parents posing
and trying to look #art

anonflexiblematerialwith-
ahightensilestrength.
Similarly, the open-sid-
ed interlocking cast iron
frame boxes (“big boxy
thing”) attracted people
like flies to honey. The
main attraction to me
was watching people test
out each wall to see if
it was one of the mirror
walls instead of the open
ones. It seemed to take
an incredible amount of
time. If you do intend to
go to the exhibit, refer to
my handy guide for not
looking like a tosser at the
end. I suppose this is what
the artist was intending
when trying to ‘play with
borders’ but, like a child
who can’t get onto the
swings because the vod-
ka-drinking youths are on
them, I have decided that I
don’t like swings anyway.
Once past the
crowd-pleasers, the art
got more serious, and
following a red and bronze
plastic handrail that twists
and curves and explodes
into mad and tangled joy
on a wall. The incongruity
and fun of it made me
laugh.
More dangly things,
like the earrings your
cooler aunt wears, and I
get my first proper look
at the “blokes walking
around with bedroom
mirrors strapped to their
chests”. Sandwich board
style, these actors prance
along, reflecting things
and getting in the way.
Finally, the showpiece.
After an hour’s wait,
Richard Wilson’s 20:50 is
a walkway out into a room
waist deep in black oil. It
shimmers and reflects very
prettily but is haunted by
the accumulated dread of
people terrified that their
coat or scarf is about to
get ruined.
Great fun, take a
camera.
The Mirror Test

strange and foreign.
I had to refer to my

myself from reaching out
