Captain
O
n Sunday,
I m p e r i a l
Wo l v e r i n e s
made history at
the University South Open
with several remarkable
achievements.
The newly formed
Women’s 1st team made
their inaugural appear-
ance at a competitive
fixture, the Men’s 1st
team accomplished 2nd
place amongst fierce com-
petition and, for the first
time, Nifemi made it on
time for the minibus that
morning!
The short drive to
Aylesbury made this
feel like a home fixture
and afforded the club a
relative lie-in, a McDon-
ald’s breakfast, and lots of
time to get changed and
warm-up; all also firsts for
the club.
The first of the three
teams to play that day was
the debuting Women’s 1st
team.
As a team made up
largely of players who
had only started playing
dodgeball in October, the
club were simply happy to
be fielding a team but did
not hold high expectations
for them.
Play got underway
against some of the top
clubs in the country and
teams who have been
formed and playing
together for years.
However, to everyone’s
surprise, Imperial’s ladies
played a blinder, only
losing each match by 1 or
2 sets.
Veteran WolverinesYan
“Adele’s
‘Someone Like
You’ on repeat
is not the best
backing track
for dodgeball!”
Jin Ho, Aqeilah Khan, and
Lalita Radtanajiravong
led the team bravely with
exceptional dodging,
catches, and throws.
Nevertheless, some
injuries were incurred;
most of boys damaged
their vocal chords with
their ecstatic support com-
peting with the blaring
dance competition being
held next door.
Adele’s “Someone Like
You” on repeat is not the
best backing track for
dodgeball!
Imperial’s Men’s 2nd
team were next to play that
day. The team was also
made up of a fair share
of dodgeball freshers. For
many, this was their first
outing.
Strong leadership
from team captain Philip
Zeeuw, as well as excel-
lent agile dodging from
Jinay Patel gave the boys
a fighting chance, but
being placed in a very
strong group, the boys
struggled to match the
more experienced teams
and in each game were
eventually overcome.
With hope beginning
to fade, a special call was
made to introduce some
much-needed energy into
their game: “YEET”. It
was believed shouting
this as they threw would
much improve their game.
Fresher Flo Ruja was the
first to try.
He throws silently. Hit!
He throws normally
again. Hit!
He throws once
more whilst screaming
“YEEET!”. Miss.
Perhaps not then.
The 2nd team finished a
respectable 10th.
Last to start that day
were the Men’s 1s.
Having come 4th in the
UK last year, they were
hoping for one of the top
rankings. With James
Rice-Mellor playing
blissfully unaware of
any of the team’s tactics,
Nithin Thoppuram twice
smashing the glasses off
a poor opposing player,
and Lochlann Allison’s
aerobatic dancing dodge
confusing the opposition
into committing a fault,
the team advanced to the
final unbeaten.
Unfortunately, they
exhausting yet successful
day, the team made their
way back to London.
With a much stronger
female presence in the
club, the traditional post-
match KFC was replaced
by calls for a rather more
classy Nando’s.
Imperial Wolverines
look forward to this
weekend and the com-
mencement of leagues
where the Women’s 1st
team can make their
league debut and the
Men’s 1st team hope
to defend their League
Champions title.
were defeated by Bir-
mingham, and finished the
day in 2nd place.
The strongest play of
the day came from Rhiju
Chatterjee, who whilst
ball-retrieving tripped
and fell over, yet did not
commit a ball retriever
fault. Video evidence
will cement this event
in history as one of the
most beautiful sporting
moments ever witnessed.
Shoutouts go out to
MoM’s Nithin Thoppu-
ram, Philip Zeeuw and Ho
Yan Jin.
