N
ow, my dear
reader, you
may be con-
fused by the
title, but please, indulge
me as I detail you the
PR disaster that was the
Blizzcon 2018 Diablo
announcement, in what
seemed like a case of
trying to put out a fire
by pouring oil on it. Let
me preface this article
by stating that I am not a
diehard Blizzard fan by
no means, however I do
consider myself to be a
supporter of the gaming
industry treating their au-
dience respectfully; this is
not what happened at the
Diablo panel in Blizzcon
2018.
To give you some
background on the series:
Diablo is a very much
beloved PC/ Console
RPG series which has
been ongoing since 1996.
The second game was
released in 2000 (its ex-
pansion in 2001) followed
by another instalment to
the series in 2012 (and its
expansion in 2014). Since
its release, the series has
been available on PC and
consoles, as such, you’d
imagine that they would
continue such a trend. So,
imagine you’re a diehard
fan of the Diablo series:
After the amazing game
that was Diablo II and less
amazing game that was
Diablo III, Blizzard an-
nounced that they would
be detailing news about
their upcoming projects
involving Diablo. It’s
been six years since the
last Diablo game, and
sure as anything fans were
ready to sink their teeth
into another gameplay and
lore rich experience, may
that be a remastering of
Diablo II or a new release.
Having heard news of
Blizzard cancelling two
other titles - Ghost and
Titan - due to them not
being up to the company’s
high standards, fans knew
that Blizzard wouldn’t
betray those standards,
especially when handling
Diablo based content.
With hearts beating
faster than a profes-
sional Starcraft player’s
mouseclicks per minute,
tickets for the upcoming
Blizzcon were sold in a
flash; if the fourth game
or a remaster were going
to be announced, people
wanted to get their hands
on the free merch and be
there for the announce-
ment. Tension being built
up like an orchestra of
drums, fans entered the
room for the moment of
truth. The room descend-
ing into silence with eager
anticipation of a new
Diablo game or remaster
from a barren six years.
Walking onto the
stage an announcer
greets the audience,
saying “Blizzcon, we
love Diablo! We love the
way Diablo has brought
millions of players around
the world together to
slay Demons!”. The hype
was immense, but then
a red flag appeared - the
announcer suddenly men-
tioned mobile devices and
how they keep us closer …
I mean it’s touching, but it
doesn’t seem particularly
relevant … you would
think? The screen behind
him changes, revealing
the newest addition to the
gaming behemoth that is
the Diablo series: a mobile
game version of Diablo
… just what no-one really
wanted. After six years
of waiting, the fans are
not greeted with news
of a new game or even a
remaster of an old one …
no, they’re greeted with
the horrific trend that is
making knockoff mobile
games out of major series.
The announcement
proceeds with the
announcer saying the
word ‘mobile’ so many
times that drinking game
fanatics would quiver at
the thought of a potential
last hurrah. Alright,
mobile games aren’t all
that bad, however, that’s
not the problem with the
situation. The problem
lies with the fact that after
waiting six years, these
diehard gamers were
greeted with a mobile
game that is almost iden-
tical in material to the
previous game, Diablo
III, as if to pawn off the
previous game as a brand
new game by changing
its platform and putting
dodgy controls on it. This
would be like having the
next Uncharted game
being ported as a cheap
Jungle Run knockoff; and
this let the fans down.
What is even worse is
that the company that the
game had been outsourced
to,wasaChinesecompany
that had produced another
game recently that had
an identical interface and
system. Suggesting that
this “NEWTM
” Diablo
game is simply a reskin of
old elements taken from
the previous game which
was then applied to the
Chinese company’s game.
The mobile game is the
equivalent of Diablo 3
but with ‘made in China’
slapped onto the back of
it, as a form of off-brand
knock off. But this isn’t
even the worst part of the
announcement.
The Q and A was
the pinnacle of how
not to answer questions
from the audience. In
some hackjob version
of Jedi Mind tricks, the
announcers diverted most
of the questions of the
audience, providing little
to no answer other than
“play the demo”; when
they did answer questions
… well, things didn’t go
very well. Initially some
of their responses were
just bad; when asked if
they had a time frame for
when consumers will see
the mobile game, the an-
nouncer replied “uh, when
it’s ready”. I know, such
a brilliant answer! The
multi-layered complexity
of it had me taken aback
as well.
When asked whether
there were any plans to
make the mobile game
playable on PC, the an-
nouncersusedtheirmighty
intellectual prowess to
tell the audience that the
plan is to have it on IOS
and Android, as if that
wasn’t (fucking) apparent
enough at this point.
They then proceeded to
state that there were no
plans to ever have it on
PC, this was immediately
met by boos from the
audience. They had an
opportunity to comfort
the audience here, but
decided to blame the fans
instead by sarcastically
saying, “do you guys not
have phones?” which was
similarly parroted by the
other announcers … the
stage couldn’t contain
such genius in that single
moment.
But then, a legend
stepped up to the mic,
voicing the thoughts
many had in their mind at
that moment, “Is this an
out of season April Fools
Joke?”. Which is met by
more more applause than
the announcement trailer
got. The announcers
replied and stated that it
wasn’t a joke whilst giving
another spiel about how
the game is on mobile,
as if the first forty time
weren’t enough to hem-
orrhage it into your brain.
It’s abundantly clear the
disconnect between what
the audience wants and
what the panellists thinks
is best, as they state that
the reason why Diablo is
going mobile is to appeal
to a wider audience, and
get more people invested
in the Blizzard commu-
nity; they said this whilst
isolating their diehard PC
and console fanbase.
The announcers then
attempted to cheer up
the audience by telling
them how great modern
technology is, how their
phones are so powerful
and are more suitable
for the game than their
£1000+ gaming rigs.
I seriously question
whoever thought this was
a good idea. For all these
mentions of going mobile
they clearly weren’t
getting any connection.
The calamity doesn’t
end there. The Diablo
online announcement
video got immediately
bombarded with dislikes,
but Blizzard’s PR team,
in all their bright mind
glory, decided to remove
100k dislikes from the
video. But it gets better,
after realising that their
audience must be wrong
in their views, after the
video getting even more
dislikes, they deleted and
re uploaded the video to
reset the like/dislike bar
… this caused an even
harsher bombardment of
dislikes. You’d think this
would be the end of it,
right?
Nope, in what seemed
to be an interesting PR
stunt gaming news feeds
were suddenly covered in
news that Diablo 4 was
going to be announced but
was abruptly cancelled at
the last minute, which was
then reported to be false
according to Blizzard.
But something doesn’t
quite seem right, almost
suspicious. Some of these
gaming news sites were
of good reputation and
unlikely to make such
a fuss out of a rumour,
unless told by an official
source. From the great
minds that brought you
deleting and re-uploading
the Diablo announcement,
I give you the possibility
that the PR team may
have had a hand in this, in
an attempt to mop up the
mess that had been made.
I mean surely something
must have gone right
during this announce-
ment? I mean … nope,
I don’t have anything for
this. And that my dear
reader, is the story of the
dumpster fire that was,
Blizzcon 2018’s Diablo
announcement.
