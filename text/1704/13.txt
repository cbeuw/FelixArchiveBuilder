F
amily doctor,
poet, novelist,
playwright and
occasional trans-
lator – William Carlos
Williams wore many hats
in his life as both a man
of medicine and a man
of letters. There seems to
be a strange compulsion
amongst doctors to write,
as though their creative
energies need some outlet
which medicine does not
adequately fulfil.
Anton Chekhov is
perhaps the best-known
example; indeed, in
history, his fame as a
writer has quite eclipsed
his career as a doctor.
Equally, Williams is
perhaps best remembered
for his epic poem Paterson
or for his short Imagist
poems such as The Red
Wheelbarrow. It is easy
to forget that he also had
an eye-poppingly busy
life as a doctor working
among the poor and dis-
enfranchised in northern
New Jersey. He would
work during the day and
write at night, scribbling
down images and bits of
verse as they occurred to
him alongside patients’
clinical notes. For him,
“the one (medicine)
nourish[ed] the other
(writing)”. “[Medicine]
was,” he wrote, “my very
food and drink, the very
thing that made it possible
for me to write.”
The Doctor Stories is
a selection of precisely
those of his works that
draw most upon his
experiences as a doctor.
As Williams wrote in his
essay ‘The Practice’ (part
of his autobiography),
the relationship between
physician and patient is an
extraordinary one. Each
individual patient, from
the highest to the lowest,
at some point “exhibits
himself” to the doctor,
seeking advice. The
doctor is thus privy to, and
is able to reveal, the “inner
secrets” of their “most
private moments”. What
a parade, what a spectacle
“What a
parade, what
a spectacle
of life passes
before the
gaze of a
doctor!”
“This
anthology
brings a
valuable
perspective to
Williams as the
doctor-writer”
of life passes before the
gaze of a doctor! Birth
and death, illness and
convalescence; the great
and small tragedies and
triumphs of life are all put
on display.
Witnessing all of this,
the doctor-writer is able
to catch a glimpse of the
“underground stream” –
the hidden thoughts, moti-
vations and emotions that
are the foundation of a
person’s very existence. It
is these flashes of insight,
these little windows into
the human condition, that
Williams recognised in
his day-to-day work and
sought to record in his
writing.
Northern New Jersey
was not a glamorous
place to work, and the
characters and situations
in Williams’s stories
reflect the environs of his
medical practice. In The
Girl With A Pimply Face,
a doctor treats a poor
family, even admiring the
straight-talking frankness
of the young daughter,
only to be told later by a
colleague that they are
“slick operators” and “a
crew of bad actors’’who
are out to prey on his
sympathy. Pulled from
real life as they are, these
vignettes sometimes have
unexpected conclusions.
In Comedy Entombed:
1930, the “comedy” is that
a miscarriage, rather than
being a sombre and tragic
occurrence, is treated with
incongruous light-heart-
edness and levity by all
involved – except for the
father, who alone seems to
be affected by the gravity
of the event.
The lens is by no means
focused solely on the
patient. Williams’s short
stories reveal the perspec-
tive of the doctor, who,
rather than a detached and
omnipresent observer, is
as much involved in each
encounter as the patients
themselves, with thoughts
and feelings that are often
controversial or inappro-
priate.
The Use of Force,
for instance, describes
the satisfaction, or even
animalistic pleasure, felt
by the doctor on forcibly
prising open the mouth of
a defiant child to reveal
the signs of throat diph-
theria. Old Doc Rivers
chronicles the decline of
a respected doctor due to
alcohol and drug abuse,
and the blind trust which
he still commands among
his patients – occasionally
with fatal consequences.
The subjectivity of the
stories is brought to the
fore by the use of the first
person and the constant
narration of the narrator’s
(is it the doctor’s? The
patient’s?) reactions and
judgements as events
unfold. Interestingly,
dialogue is put down
directly in the text with
neither quotation marks
nor attributions to specific
speakers, making the
reader feel as though s/
he is eavesdropping on a
scene which is playing out
in real time.
A brief collection of
Williams’s most famous
medical poems is also
included. A Cold Front
paints a particularly vivid
portrait of a patient who,
burdened by eight children
and expecting a ninth,
is seeking an abortion.
Le Médecin Malgré Lui
(after Molière’s farce,
The Doctor In Spite
of Himself) points out
the contrast between
Williams’s reality and
the ideal doctor who
“gr[ows] a decent beard”,
“cultivat[es] a look of
importance” and “never
think[s] anything but a
white thought”.
This anthology of Wil-
liams’s works by Robert
Coles brings a valuable
perspective to Williams
as the doctor-writer,
particularly the sensitivity
and empathy with which
he met his patients and
the wry self-awareness
of his reactions to them.
The foreword by Coles,
a doctor who was himself
taught by Williams,
and the afterword by
Williams’s son Williams
Eric Williams provide
even greater insight into
the life and work of this
remarkable physician
‘of rare humanity and
self-knowledge’.
