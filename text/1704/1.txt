Women in Tech: The Inside Story// Imperial College London
I
mperial College
Business School
has become the
first institution in
the world to use live
holograms as part of its
lectures.
The technology was un-
veiled during a “Women
in Tech: The Inside Story”
event. In a panel featuring
four speakers, two were
present on stage and two
appeared as holograms
from Los Angeles and
New York.
This technology aims
to overcome limitations
of traditional teaching
methods.Facultymembers
who are travelling will be
able to continue teaching
students whilst away.
For popular lectures,
the speaker’s image can
be projected in multiple
locations simultaneously.
It will also allow global
educators and experts to
speak to students without
having to travel to the UK.
David Lefevre, Direc-
tor of Imperial College
Business School Edtech
Lab said: “Rather than
replacing or reducing
real-life lectures, the
hologram technology will
provide greater flexibility
for academics...and widen
the scope for Imperial to
invite global leaders and
influencers from industry
to give talks to students,
therefore enriching the
learning experience.”
He continued: “We
believe these holograms
have a much greater sense
of presence [than video
conferences]. The lectur-
ers can really interact."
The Business School
hopes to start deploying
holograms in teaching
during the current aca-
demic year. They have
already made plans to use
this technology to allow a
lecturer to talk to a busi-
ness school in Spain next
February.
The holographic
telepresence technology
was developed by AHRT
Media, a hologram
company based in
Toronto, and is being
adapted by the Business
School’s Edtech Lab.
AHRT Media has a
global network of “capture
studios”, in places in-
cluding Los Angeles and
Singapore, and also offer
a portable capture kit. To
capture their image, the
speaker sits against a dark
backdrop in the studio
and is lit from both sides.
The image is transmitted
and projected onto a glass
screen on stage, which
is placed in front of a
backdrop controlled by
a software to create the
illusion of depth. They
will appear as life-size 3D
figures wherever they are
projected.
