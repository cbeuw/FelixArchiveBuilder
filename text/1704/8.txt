Pittsburgh, a victimless crime?

wake of the Pittsburgh massacre
COMMENT

The 27th of October
2018 will be a date
tattooed on the hearts
of every Jewish person
around the world. Eleven
members of the Tree of
Life synagogue, located in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
had their Saturday prayers
cut tragically short. The
details of the crime are
gruesome, as with many
mass shootings, but the
profoundly bitter (but
all too familiar) taste of
banality lingers over the
air.
Although an important
aspect of this atrocity is
the lack of control around
firearms that has enabled
so many tragedies in
the past decade, there is
another aspect that is just
as crucial and must be
discussed: the victims,
or victim of this crime,
Judaism. The eleven indi-
viduals who tragically lost
their lives were not killed
by coincidence.Their guilt
was in their association,
their association to the
Tree of Life synagogue,
and their Jewish ethnicity.
The attacker shouted
anti-Semitic slogans at
the scene of the massacre,
his online profile
showed various signs
of anti-Semitism. This
attack was anti-Semitic,
or racist - the words can
be used interchangeably.
However, upon listening
to Donald Trump and his
administration’s response
to the attack, you may be
forgiven for not being sure
who these victims actually
were. Trump, as he has
done at mass shootings
before, used this tragedy
to push his pro-gun
agenda, claiming that
armed guards at the scene
could do what a team of
police officers couldn’t do
and stop the attack. It is
shocking that a man with
a Jewish son-in-law and a
daughter who converted
to Judaism, thinks that
the historically anti-gun
Jewish community would
ever be comfortable with
armed guards inside their
religious establishments.
Furthermore, Trump’s
Counsellor (spin-doctor),
Kellyanne Conway,
referred to the “anti-re-
ligiosity” of the massacre,
provoked by late-night
comedy hosts. If a victim-
less crime ever existed,
Trump and his adminis-
tration seem hell-bent on
proving that it does.
Trump did condemn the
attack as an anti-Semitic
attack that attacked “all of
us.” This was a day after
his previous comments
and the news cycle had
moved on. This is the
problem with the Trump
administration. If there is
one thing he is good at, it is
being able to not alienate
racists. Trump’s claim of
“good and bad people on
both sides” after neo-Na-
zis and anti racists clashed
in Charlottesville still
rings in many people’s
ears. In this attack in Pitts-
burgh, despite the shooter
claiming not to be a
Trump supporter, many of
his supporters have been
very receptive of the ideas
that the shooter had, an
example being that Jewish
philanthropist George
Soros was responsible
for mass immigration of
Central Americans into
the United States, an idea
that has been floated in
many republican midterm
campaign advertisements
over the last few weeks.
This makes it reasonable
to conclude that the Re-
publican Party is currently
a comfortable place for
those who can be told that
a mass shooting of Jewish
worshippers is actually
an attack on gun loving,
religious conservatives
who are the butt of Trevor
Noah’s jokes on the Daily
Show.
However, it must be
noted that the problem
of how the Jewish com-
munity is perceived is
not limited to American
conservatives. From the
other side of the political
spectrum, attacks on the
Jewish community have
undergone a victim-blam-
ing analysis similar to
Trump’s suggestion
about hiring security
guards in the Tree of
Life synagogue. “What
about Israel,” is a line that
Jewish people all over the
world are all too used to
after an act of anti-Semi-
tism. As if a geo-political
conflict thousands of
miles away makes an act
of hatred a justifiable act.

“The Jewish
community
has received
the victim
status that
this attack
warranted ”
I believe that this crit-
icism stems largely from
the fact that the Jewish
people, the Western
world’s oldest minority,
has developed into a het-
erogeneous community
over the last few thousand
years. Some have sought
to retain their traditional
identity and others have
aimed to integrate into
the society they live in
and attempt not to stand
out. From intermarriage,
to second-name changes,
etc., some members of
the Jewish community
were able to blend into the
Western society around
them. Coupled with the
deep connection to the
financially and militarily
powerful Israeli state that
many members of the
Jewish community have,
there has been a new
tendency from anti-racists
to dismiss the Jewish
people as a group not
really worthy of minority
status.
Overall, seeking to
minimise the suffering
of the Jewish community
after a tragedy is some-
thing that takes place on
all sides of the political
spectrum. In a macabre
way, the Pittsburgh shoot-
er’s brazen stupidity as
he screamed anti-Semitic
slogans at the site of his
bloody mass murder was
welcome. It meant that
the Jewish community
received the victim status
that this attack warranted.
Any claims that this
attack was some kind
of payback for actions
committed in a conflict in
the middle east were not
taken seriously, Palestine
was not mentioned by the
attacker. Any claims that
this attack was actually
an attack on the ideology
where it could be argued
that this attack came from
due to anti-religious and
anti-conservative fervour
were also not taken seri-
ously. The attacker was
unambiguous in his hatred
and where his hatred was
directed. Even now, as
this article has mentioned,
there were voices seeking
to minimise the fact that
this attack was racist.
Perhaps the world, (some
people could argue the
Jewish community itself),
must decide whether it
belongs in its place as the
Western World’s oldest
minority.
