The college has

initiative is part of the

Imperial College Business School launches first live
hologram lectures
Ghost’ technique, which
has been used by French
presidential candidate
Jean-Luc Melechon, and
in the entertainment in-
dustry to project Michael
Jackson’s image during
the 2014 Billboard Music
Awards. The equipment
needed to set up Pepper’s
Ghost can cost tens of
thousands of pounds each
time, whereas, according
to Dr Lefevre, AHRT’s
method “runs at the low
thousands each time so,
for the first time, universi-
ties can afford it”.
Not everyone is so
sanguine about the
technology. A YouGov
survey found that 45%
of respondents thought
hologram lectures were a
bad idea and that lecturers
should always be physi-
cally present. Only 22%
thought it was a beneficial
resource.
Professor Francisco
Veloso, Dean of Imperial
College Business School,
said: “Investing in new
technology is a vital part
of our strategy to create
more flexible and inspir-
ing learning experiences.
We are keen to grow
our digital visibility as a
business school and the
new hologram represents
the pioneering work our
Edtech Lab is undertaking
in this area.”

single-use plastic cups
from water dispens-
ers and introduced a
“bring-your-own con-
tainer” scheme since the
summer. The initiative
follows in the footsteps
of other universities and
high-street coffee shops
such as Starbucks, Costa
and Pret-A-Manager.
Single-use “paper”
cups are, in fact, laminated
with a difficult-to-remove
polythene film to prevent
the hot liquid from
seeping into the paper
and cannot be recycled by
conventional processes.
Although technically re-
cyclable, only three recy-
cling facilities in the UK
are able to process paper
cups. Not only does their
production contribute to
greenhouse gas emission,
of the 2.5 billion coffee
cups disposed of in the
past year in Britain,
only 1% were recycled.
Of the remainder, some
have been incinerated,
some have been buried
and some will end up in
waterways. The polythene
lining breaks down into
micro-plastics which are
potentially toxic to marine
life and have recently been
found in public drinking
water – with unknown
effects on human health.
According to Greening
Imperial (a cross-campus
initiative that aims to
transform Imperial into a
university that is a pioneer
in sustainability), the
College disposes of 2,750
single-use cups each day.
Taste Imperial has
worked to promote its
reward scheme for those
who bring reusable con-
tainers in which custom-
ers with a Yoyo account
receive points that can be
used to get a free coffee.
This does not however
benefit those who does not
use Yoyo and, although
reducing waste, could
incentivise increased
coffee consumption.
More exciting to many
is that branded glass/
bamboo KeepCups are
available for purchase at
the till for £6 (or £9 with a
water-bottle) with the first
hot drink included free.
What has the reaction
from staff and students
been? Generally people
are in support of reducing
waste. However, some
students have been con-
fused by the pricing. In
contrast with Costa and
Starbucks, Taste Imperial
has opted to add the 15p
surcharge to the price
displayed rather than
offer a discount. This
may discourage students
from purchasing coffee
on campus, although, at
less than £2, even with the
surcharge, a student cup
of coffee is still less dear
than high-street competi-
tors.
Will you raise a toast
to the work that Greening
Imperial is doing? If so -
be sure to bring a cup.

The boy is back
W
elcome to
the inner
workings of
my mind.
Strap yourselves in for
my weekly ramblings. Or
don't. I'd actually much
prefer if nobody read this.
In the words of Drake,
"the boy is back". In
this case, the boy is me.
Why is the boy back?
Back from where? How
long is the boy back for?
Well, there are a number
of reasons why I feel
like I'm "back". After a
difficult few weeks, I feel
like I'm finally getting the
hang of this whole Felix
thing. There really isn't
that much to the job if I'm
honest (famous last words,
I know)! I think the fact
I'm adjusting to the role
better is evidenced by the
fact that I'm currently on
course to send the paper
off to print by 11.30pm. I
know this sounds late (and
is technically past the print
deadline) but it marks a
significant improvement
on my previous five
issues of Felix. Round of
applause for progress!
The main reason I feel
like I'm back is because
this week I was able
to make a return to my
beloved Music section.
It's no secret that I love
writing about Music and
this week I was finally able
to get back to doing what
I do best. Turn to page 17
to read my review of UK
soul singer Samm Hen-
shaw's recent Scala show
that I was lucky enough
to attend. The show was
phenomenal; I was truly
blown away and it's just
raised my anticipation for
his debut album, which
is due to drop at some
point in 2019. Gaetan
Judd, Samm's guitarist,
appeared as a guest on
Episode 12 of my podcast,
"2 Gs in a Pod' (shameless
plug, I know!) and he's
convinced that Samm's
upcoming album will be
the "best UK soul album
in history". Big statement.
However, after seeing him
live, I wouldn't put it past
2
Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-
ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach
you everything you need to know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk
Samm. I was able to catch
up with Samm and the rest
of the band backstage after
the show and the genersal
sentiment was that they
had just produced their
best ever performance.
Samm is a special artist,
only going from strength
to strength and becoming
a more accomplished per-
former; if you don't know,
get to know!
I was mainly able
to write for the Music
section this week because
we finally managed to get
News writers this week.
Delegation is amazing...
who knew? Next week,
I'll be delegating the
writing of this Editorial.
Any takers? In all serious-
ness though, if any News
on campus interests you,
please write about it! Felix
can't catch everything but
if it's important to you,
make sure it gets a spot in
the paper.
Finally, I want to echo
my thanks from last week
to the whole Felix team for
their support during this
difficult personal period
for me. Your work, par-
ticularly in putting out last
week's issue of Felix, has
been nothing short of fan-
tastic! I was able to attend
Lauren's funeral without
having to worry about
what would happen with
the paper, largely due to
your brilliant work. I also
want to wish my friend
and co-host of "2 Gs in a
Pod", Isaac Freeling, good
luck as he travels to India
for 9 months to continue
his never-ending pursuit
of the bag. I know he
won't be reading this but
I need to fill up space and
I'm running out of things
to ramble on about. We
recorded the last episode
of "2 Gs in a Pod" and
dedicated it to Lauren's
memory; please give it
a listen if you're keen to
hear about the amazing
ceremony for an amazing,
very special person.
Think I've rambled
enough now...
