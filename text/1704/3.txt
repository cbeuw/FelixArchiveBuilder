Imperial College
calls for all staff and
students to complete
survey in attempt to
improve Black, Asian
and Minority Ethnic
representation

I
mperial College
London is in the
process of produc-
ing an action plan to
apply for the Race Equal-
ity Charter (REC) award
and, to launch this pro-
cess, staff and students are
being invited to complete
a 10-minute confidential
survey. This, in conjunc-
tion with the publication
of the College's Equality,
Diversity and Inclusion
(EDI) Strategy and Im-
perial College Union's
ongoing work with its
Liberation Review, forms
part of a concerted effort
across College and the
Union to improve the
representation, success
and expreience of Black,
Asian and Minority
Ethnic (BAME) staff and
students at Imperial. The
REC survey opens on 12th
November and closes on
1st
December.
The Equality Chal-
lenge Unit (ECU)'s
Race Equality Charter
aims to improve the rep-
resentation, progression
and success of minority
ethnic staff and students
within higher education
by providing a framework
through which institutions
work to identify and
self-reflect on institution-
al and cultural barriers
standing in the way of
minority ethnic staff and
students. Member insti-
tutions, such as Imperial,
develop initiatives and
solutions for action, and
can apply for a Bronze
or Silver REC award,
depending on their level
of progress. Institutions
are required to re-apply
for the award every three
years with additional
renewal requirements.
The Bronze award,
which Imperial is seeking,
recognises universities
with a solid foundation
for eliminating racial
inequalities and develop-
ing an inclusive culture
that values all staff and
students. It acknowledges
commitment and prepara-
tion to act. According to
ECU, Bronze institutions
are characterised by "their
candid understanding
of how race equality is
perceived within their
institution and a thor-
ough acknowledgment
of issues that exist for
minority ethnic staff and
students, their identifica-
tion of context-specific
priorities for race equality
work with a clear under-
standing of their aims
and what success looks
like, a comprehensive,
evidence-based action
plan, underpinning the
institution’s race equality
priorities and aims, and
having institution-wide
senior and middle man-
agement commitment to
advancing race equality
demonstrated through
their involvement with
this work, ownership of
actions and the allocation
of adequate resources".
Imperial has estab-
lished a Self Assessment
Team - a panel comprising
20 people from across
the university, including
individuals from a variety
of ethnic backgrounds
and a balance of students,
full and part-time staff
representing each of the
faculties and relevant
central departments. An
introductory meeting was
held on 1st
November and
topics including aspects
relating to attracting
more BAME applicants
were discussed. David
Tyoember, the Black and
Minority Ethnic Students
Officer and member of the
Self Assessment Team,
commented:
"The results of this
survey will greatly aid in
providing the College with
critical insights needed in
our work towards forming
an Imperial community
that is more inclusive,
more welcoming and
free from racism and
discrimination."
The Self Assessment
Team plans to meet on
a termly basis, with the
next meeting scheduled
for January, following the
closing of the survey.

Newspaper profits to be donated to Anti-Racism
Campaign
The way forward is
action,notcensorship!
So, what are we doing
about newspapers
with racist content?
O
n 23rd
October,
a paper high-
lighting the
racist tones
of some newspapers
stocked in the Union’s
Shop Extra was brought
to Union Council, call-
ing for the ban of such
tabloids being sold. The
topic brought about an
invigorating discussion,
where approximately 50
elected students from
various years, degrees
and backgrounds, de-
bated whether a ban was
the best response for the
situation.
It was acknowledged
that the papers in question,
The Sun, Daily Mail, and
Daily Express; have all
been condemned by the
European Commission
against Racism and Intol-
erance (ECRI) and the UN
Human Rights Chief, Zeid
Ra’ad Al Hussein, for the
way they express their
opinions and content,
fuelling prejudices and
directing hate toward
particular groups. Some
council members argued
that the papers should
be banned from campus.
One stated that, “We are
funding these papers and
these papers profit purely
because they are racist…
and by stocking them we
say 'yeah this is the correct
way to go forward, this
is the right way to make
money' ". Meanwhile,
others in the room pointed
out “…this shouldn’t be
about censorship, but the
way in which the Union
responds to such head-
lines.”.
Following alternate
suggestions of censoring
the front pages with
blank paper, papers
being available only on
request, or even banning
sale of any newspapers
altogether, the outcome
of the students' vote was
concluded by one student
as “…although racism is
wrong, we should not be
censoring what students
have access to. This
would limit their view
of the world, creating
an Imperial bubble and
making them ignorant to
the issues.”

“The Sun,
Daily Mail and
Daily Express
have all been
condemned by
the European
Commission
against
Racism and
Intolerance”
“This shouldn't
be about
censorship,
but the way
in which
the Union
responds
to such
headlines”
Instead, the newspapers
shall continue to be sold
in Shop Extra, with the
profits from The Sun,
Daily Mail, and Daily
Express being donated
to an anti-racism charity
on a monthly basis. A
statement that not only
shows the Union refuses
to profit off racism but
that it commits to empow-
ering an organisation or
campaign that will bring
about real changes in the
media world. The Deputy
President (Finance &
Services) [DPFS] together
with Ansh Bhatnagar, the
author of the paper, chose
‘Stop Funding Hate’ – a
social media campaign
pressurising companies
to pull out of advertising
in these tabloids, a main
source of income fuelling
these newspapers.The aim
is to force the newspapers
to make positive changes
around inclusivity and
equality in their content
and be more aligned to
the advertising company's
values, to reattract their
source of income. This
campaign has already
seen success, with compa-
nies such as Lego ending
their contracts with the
Daily Mail.
On top of this, the
DPFS will be starting a
campaign to write to the
Independent Press Stand-
ards Organisation (IPSO),
highlighting offensive
headlines that go against
our Union value of in-
clusivity and pressurising
them to investigate these
tabloids' editorial stand-
ards. The aim is to involve
any students interested so,
