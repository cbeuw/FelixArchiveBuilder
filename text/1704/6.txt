WithBolsonaro’svictoryinthesecondround,
Brazil goes down a tenebrous path
The President-elect of the South American country is a potential autocrat. His rise is another
symptom of the increasingly global strength of the far right.

n last week’s run-off
election, Brazil’s
fascist-in-chief Jair
Bolsonaro won the
presidency with 55% of
the vote. Yes, fascist is
the appropriate descrip-
tion, and let the record
show that this was a far
from a fair fight. From
the 2016 impeachment
of the former President
Dilma Rouseff on flimsy
charges of creative book-
keeping (with even those
who led the impeachment
process admitting that
Rouseff was one of the
least corrupt politicians),
the Brazilian election
was nothing more than a
coup masquerading with
phoney democratic legit-
imacy. In fact, until two
months before the elec-
tion, the overwhelming
frontrunner was former
President Luiz Inácio Lula
da Silva, but in an unprec-
edented act, Brazil’s top
electoral court, barred
Lula from participating
in the election until the
Supreme Court decided to
acquit him in his appeal.
This move went directly
against the request from
the UN Human Rights
Committee that believed
that if Brazil’s democratic
legitimacy was to be pre-
served, Lula should have
been allowed to stand.
Lula’s removal made the
results a foregone conclu-
sion, and despite a spirited
campaign by Fernando
Haddad, in the end it was
a hill too high to climb.
So who is the new
Brazilian president?
Well, Jair Bolsonaro
comes with a platter
deplorable beliefs.
Directly from the Trump
playbook, Bolsonaro has
fuelled the xenophobic
fears over migrants
and refugees who in
his words are ‘scum of
the earth. In regards to
gender rights, he has
taken his lead from the
thuggish Filipino Pres-
ident Rodrigo Duterte,
and claimed he wouldn’t
rape an opposition poli-
tician, Maria do Rosário,
because “she is very
ugly”. In an ironic twist,
the so-called ‘law and
order’ candidate “prom-
ising to end crime” has
openly discussed how
he as president would
break long standing Bra-
zilian law in employing
torture as a legitimate
means for interroga-
tion. Bolsonaro’s rise
is disappointing for a
country that has come
a long way in healing
its racial diversity, but
racist comments like
“they [black people]
don’t do anything” have
stoked fears amongst
racial minorities that the
new President may try to
return Brazil back to its
racist past.
Another area in
which Brazil have made
tremendous strides is in
LGBT rights, with civil
unions legalised since
2003 and gay marriage
since 2013. However
in this too Bolsonaro
is a cultural dinosaur,
having claimed that he
would hypotetically
prefer his son to be dead
rather than gay.
Brazil has come a
long way since Lula first
came to power in 2002,
with over 30 million
entering the middle
class. Social welfare
schemes have reduced
income inequality, in-
creased expenditure on
education and healthcare
have meant that better
national outcomes and
an average 7% economic
growth before the reces-
sion that has plagued
Brazil since 2014 since
the fall in commodity
prices. But the rise of
Bolsonaro, fuelled by
the youth which once
was a strong voting
block for the Workers’
Party, is in large part a
reflection on how the
Workers’ Party became
complacent. Despite
the partisan nature of
Operation Car Wash (the
anti-corruption investi-
gation), there has been
undeniable graft and
corruption amongst all
political parties. Brazil
have witnessed histor-
ically high crime rates
and the worst recession
in Brazil’s history since
2014. Like Brexit, Modi
and Trump – Bolsonaro’s
rise can be attributed to
the failures of the po-
litical left. Bolsonaro’s
win follows a trend of
populist extreme right
wingers winning historic
races. The young people
that propelled Bolsonaro
to power did not support
him because of his
racism, but despite it.
Corruption was Bolson-
aro’s winning message.
There will be far
reaching consequences
of this election result, not
least environmental deg-
rapidly increase Brazil’s
deforestation rate. If the
recent IPCC report is to
be believed, the fate of
the world is at state, and
Brazil is at the forefront
of the climate struggle.
Brazil has been in
this road before. Bol-
sonaro has praised the
brutal dictatorship that
ruled the country from
1964 to 1985, and has
openly said “[he is] in
favour of a dictator-
ship.” And we should
believe that he means
what he says. Already
the President-elect has
made a mockery of the
independence of the
judiciary by appointing
the judge Sergio Moro
(who had convicted
Lula) as the new Justice
Minister. Bolsonaro has
not even taken is oath
of office, yet his goons
have been encouraged
in physically attacking
over 20 universities,
trying to suppress dis-
senting free speech.
In 1922, the first
ever mention of Adolf
Hitler in the New York
Times names him as
‘unselfishly patriot-
ic’ and according to
‘well-informed sources’
Hitler’s anti-Semitism
was “not so genuine or
violent as it sounded.”
History has shown the
dangers of minimizing
the threat posed by
fascists. Throughout
the 2016 Presidential
election, media outlets
were sure that Donald
Trump would become
more presidential when
he won the Republican
primary. He did not.
Thus, we cannot afford
to underestimate the
likes of Bolsonaro.

radation and subjugation
of tribal rights. Bolson-
aro once lamented why
the conquistadors didn’t
completely exterminate
the indigenous people
of the Amazon, and has
promised that he will
not leave a single square
millimetre of protected
reserved tribal land.
Furthermore, despite the
Brazillian parliament
having nearly univer-
sally ratified the Paris
Climate Accords, Bol-
sonaro has threated to
tear them up. Logging,
mining and big-agricul-
ture has funnelled vast
amounts of money to
Brazil’s right wing, and
their puppet has bragged
about how he would
