W
e’ve all had
our classic
“Eat, Pray,
L o v e ”
moment where it just
seems like we desperately
need to sit there and stare
at a massive plate of pasta
before we absolutely
devour it. Unfortunately,
whilst getting on the
next flight to Italy might
seem mouth-wateringly
tempting, recreating that
moment might need to
take the backseat right
now – or at least until we
break up for the summer
(or at least Easter - I mean,
what are those 5 weeks
for?). Alas, we know we
all need that incredible
Italian fix somehow, so
we’ve taken to the streets
to bring you the best
selection of Italian food
London has to offer.…
Fun fact: they all end with
an ‘O’... coincidence? I
don’t think so. Let Italy’s
cuisine convince your
tastebuds and read on!
PASSO
Dubbed London’s
“LA Italian” hotspot, this
contemporary Shoreditch
restaurant doesn’t just
offer scrumptious authen-
tic Italian dishes, but even
has a DJ to play live music
on Thursdays. Passo is
the perfect spot if you’re
looking for somewhere
to fine dine in jeans. The
chill, casual vibe they’ve
got going on, paired with
their legendary niche
dishes makes for such a
relaxed, cosy evening,
and will definitely
increase your appreciation
for more than just Penne
Pomodoro. If you’re up
to try something new and
“Passo is
the perfect
spot if you’re
looking for
somewhere
to fine dine in
jeans”
“Whether
you’re after
Puglian sea
bream with
gremolata, or
Pappardelle
with wild boar
ragu – they’ve
got it all”
gorgeously Italian, we
recommend the Octopus
Ragout, or their Anchovy
Caramelised Onion Pizza
– our favourite dishes that
we’re sure will stay with
you forever.
FRANCO’S
If you’ve lived in
London for a while now,
you’ll know this place is
iconic. It’s pretty much
been around for as long
as the queen has (okay,
maybe that’s a slight ex-
aggeration – but it’s o l d)
and has become a staple
for homemade Italian
food. This Michelin
star restaurant offers
the pasta dishes of your
dreams, with everything
from lobster linguine and
chestnut tagliatelle to a
good ol’ classic lasagne
on the menu. You might
want to book in advance
though because, much like
a flight to Italy, Franco’s
is usually booked quite
far in advance, but once
you get the chance to try
their food, it’ll all become
clear…
FRANTOIO
If you’re after authen-
tic Italian dishes with
flawless, impeccable pres-
entation, then Frantoio is
exactly the place to be.
Their Risotto Primavera,
topped with luscious, de-
lectable baby artichokes
- cooked to perfection
- is a taste of heaven.
Located right in the heart
of Chelsea, Frantoio’s
location couldn’t be more
prime, and the buzzing
evening ambience prac-
tically means you’re as
close to Italy as you’re
going to get. And the
cherry on top? The staff
are AMAZING. Quick,
excellent service, great
food and a to-die-for
environment – what more
could you possibly want?
Sounds like a perfect meal
out to us!
BOCCA DI
LUPO
Translating to “the
mouth of the wolf”,
Bocca di Lupo literally
has everything you can
possibly dream of in
their menu. Located deep
on the streets of Soho,
this gem of a restaurant
serves us some sensa-
tional regional goodness.
Whether you’re after sea
bream with gremolata
from Puglia, Pappardelle
with wild boar ragu from
Tuscany or anchovy-filled
sage leaves from Venice –
they’ve got it all. The best
bit? You can either get
small portions or go larger
for an extra fiver, roughly.
Getting the smaller plates
also means you get to try
loads of different dishes,
and who wouldn’t want
to do that! The more, the
merrier?
GELUPO
Now you know we
weren’t possibly going to
leave you without dessert,
were we? Legend has it
Sicilians used to carry ice
from the mountains and
mix it with compotes and
berries to create the deli-
ciousness we call gelato
today – thank goodness
for that creation, eh? We
know we’re all watching
our waistlines (or trying
to), so Gelupo can be
incredibly alluring with
its low-fat gelato and
to-die-for sorbet. With
different flavours every
season, you won’t want to
miss this masterpiece of a
dessert place. And the best
part? It’s right across from
Bocca di Lupo, so make
sure you save some room
after dinner!
