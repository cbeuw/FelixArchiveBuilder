Johnny English’s Third Strike
A sequel that doesn’t work, in a franchise that never worked.

Strikes Again is an
unfortunate movie.
It feels like it ran
out of something; maybe
it was time, maybe it was
interest, but it was prob-
ably money. What could
have been another classic
Rowan Atkinson vehicle
has ended up a hollow
and corporate mess, and
yet the occasional scene
had the crowd howling
with laughter so I think
it’s worth at least talking
about.
Rowan Atkinson does
an exceptional job recap-
turing the self-assured
idiocy of Johnny English
which is a joy to watch.
sequence in the middle
involving VR was so
spectacularly entertaining
it alone was almost worth
the price of admission.
A decent number of the
jokes land and the British
cringe humour is just as
potent as ever.
But man, that’s all the
positivity I can muster.
So much of this movie is
painful to watch. Emma
Thompson plays an
unnamed prime minister
“The editing
is never
anything more
than medio-
cre ... The
production
quality here
is amateur at
best”
“But Johnny
English Strikes
Again is just
bad ... Don’t go
to the cinema
for this, it’s not
worth your
money”
and is just terrible.
Wooden, inconsistent,
and awkward; it’s like
she doesn’t want to be
there. The villain ‘Jason
Volta’ played by Jake
Lacy is both written and
performed abysmally. A
moment where he punches
the ceiling of his car in
frustration might actually
be the worst acting I’ve
ever seen in theatres. His
introduction is effectively
a TED Talk wherein he
babbles complete tech-
nical gibberish before
the film cuts away to the
prime minister assuring
you he definitely is a tech
genius billionaire. Oh
and his plan is nonsense.
Not classic pulpy spy
nonsense, more “the
hell do you even want?”
nonsense.
The editing is never
anything more than
mediocre. There are
multiple times where cuts
drag on leaving scenes
feeling uncomfortably
stilted. There is no
creative cinematography
outside of a couple in
the previously mentioned
VR scene and this is not
helped by the almost
comically bad CGI. The
production quality here is
amateur at best.
But it gets worse. Very
minor spoilers ahead, but
trust me, you shouldn’t
care. Let’s start with the
product placement. There
is an extended car chase
between an Aston Martin
and a new BMW IS3.
The whole thing is shot
exactly like a car advert,
topped off with Bough
explaining to the audience
how amazing the IS3 is.
It’s depressing to watch.
There is one excellent
joke near the end of the
sequence but it can’t
fix a broken sequence.
Characters periodically
admire phones or tablets
centre stage while stating
how great they are, and
occasionally even quoting
specs like it’s a promo
for Carphone Warehouse.
The final confrontation
memorably involves
Ophelia (the worst spy
in any Johnny English
film. Let that sink in.),
played by Olga Kurylen-
ko, running out with a
Samsung Galaxy tablet
and effectively screaming
“this will save the day”.
And then it does.
Buteventhoseproblems
are overshadowed by the
structural issues. It feels
like there were some
very hasty changes made
during production, in fact
I wouldn’t be surprised
if the originally planned
third act was scrapped in
favour of a much cheaper
alternative. At the start,
Johnny is shown working
as an English teacher
while secretly training
his students in espionage.
The film is screaming
“these kids will help save
the day” at the top of its
lungs. The conclusion of
the second act would so
perfectly transition to his
defeated return to school
that I was genuinely
stunned when the very
next scene squanders all
that build-up so anticli-
mactically.
I’m fairly certain
Atkinson and Thompson
were never on set together,
Johnny English doing his thing // IMDb
“It feels like
there were
some very
hasty changes
made during
production”
scenes they share never
actually show them in the
same shot. If you told me
she was brought in for
some last minute addi-
tions in order to establish
that replacement third act,
I’d believe it, and it would
explain her complete
apathy during the rest
of the film. It was also
heavily telegraphed that
Johnny might find love
in and settle down with
Ophelia, but of course
this never pays off either.
They don’t even get as
much as a goodbye. There
had to have been some
heavy handed rewrites
because I refuse to believe
Rowan Atkinson would
come back for this script.
Look, this film is
infuriating. I wanted to
love it, I was so on board
when I sat down in the
theatre that had it been
even mediocre I probably
would have raved about it.
But it’s just bad. There are
good scenes, but they’ll be
equally good on YouTube
as standalone clips in a
couple of months. Don’t
go to the cinema for this,
it’s not worth your money.
Ben Miller, returning as
Bough, is equally great.
Their interplay is as
charming as ever, almost
everything that works
in this film is down to
those two. There are
some legitimately good
sequences. A delightfully
silly car chase at the end
of the second act had me
grinning, and a prolonged
“Rowan
Atkinson does
an exceptional
job
recapturing
the self-
assured idiocy
of Johnny
English which
is a joy to
watch”
