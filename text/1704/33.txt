Cross-Country Makes Gains at Mitcham Common

J
ust two weeks after
the first cross-coun-
try race of the
London University’s
XC League at Parliament
Hill, the rowdy Imperial
runners woke up on
Halloween to find the sun
shining and their calen-
dars showing the highlight
of their upcoming day: a
lovely race at Mitcham
Common.
The course is appreciat-
ed for being quite fast and
flat, but don’t let this fool
you as the roller-coaster
section in the middle of
the laps has left many a
runner out of juice in the
past.
Going into the race, the
women’s A team sat in
2nd place, very close to
St Mary’s, while the B, C,
D, and E teams were top
of their respective leagues
with a very impressive
performance at Parlia-
ment Hill. Meanwhile,
the men’s teams were
resting in 4th place for the
A team, with the B team
9th overall and 3rd of the
B teams, with St Mary’s
also leading the way for
the men.
Being in charge of
the course set-up for this
race, Imperial’s helpful
volunteers made their way
to the South London park
with all their equipment
by taking the esteemed
District Line to Wim-
bledon Park and then
the tram to the notorious
Beddington Lane.
The rest of the team
met as usual at Beit Quad
at 1pm to follow the
same route to be there in
time for the 3:15pm start,
allowing plenty of time
for “group inertia” on the
journey and a sufficient
warm-up/toilet stop upon
arrival. Nobody managed
to get lost en route despite
Imperial’s lack of experi-
ence riding the tram, and
the club set up camp under
the shining sun ready and
motivated for another
strong race.
As the race was about
to begin, the sturdy
athletes shed their layers
like a snake, brought out
their spikes and vests (for
those who had managed
to get their hands on one
of the limited supply or
borrow them from one of
several injured runners)
and entered the well-re-
hearsed formation for the
traditional team picture,
followed by a late rush to
the start line.
The pace was set early
and it was fast from the
gun. Rapidly reaching the
first set of hills, St Mary’s
men led the race into the
roller-coaster section as
the sun was shining upon
golden leaves, followed
closely by a pack of
Imperial runners, includ-
ing the club’s very own
captain Fergus Johnson.
After the race, the
baking bonanza took place
as it always does, as the
club’s “Baker of the Year”
award is as coveted (if not
more) as a podium in the
Cross-Country league,
featuring degustation of
croissants, cookies and
spooky cupcakes.
ICXC put in an out-
standing performance
as the women’s A team
smashed it: Georgia Curry
and Kate Olding came in
1st and 2nd in the race in
22:31 and 23:21 respec-
tively, promoting them
to the top 2 places on the
overall leaderboard!
They were followed
closely by Alix Vermeu-
len coming in 6th in
24:18 and Lara Sterritt in
10th place, just under 25
minutes, meaning they
were the strongest team
that day, and now sit atop
the overall leaderboard
– well on their way to
retaining the title with 3
fixtures remaining.
Anna Wilson led the B
team home in a fabulous
14th place. Imperial’s
ladies excelled in every
single way as the B and C
teams came in 2nd in their
respective leagues, with
many of our very own
Couch to 5K runners per-
forming strongly, notably
Noemie David-Rogeat
finishing in 35:01,
Yunping Zhang in 36:41
and Nathalie Podder in
45:19.
Meanwhile, on the
men’s side, Charlie
McFadzean brought it
home in 20th place in a
rapid 32:48, followed by
Lucas Kreifels in 25th in
33:31, men’s captain Jack
McKeon in 29th in 33:51,
a wavy club captain
Fergus Johnson in 30th
in 33:59 and Jim Warren
in 38th in 34:48, followed
closely by Matt Ryan
in 39th only a second
behind, and leading the B
team.
Overall, the men’s A
team maintained their
4th place overall, still 53
points behind St Mary’s
B team in 3rd which
demonstrates SMU’s
calibre. Furthermore,
the B team also showed
a strong performance as
they ended overall in 10th
place and 3rd in the B
league, as well as C and
D teams who are now 3rd
in their respective leagues
as well.
Now two races into the
season, everything is still
very much in play, and the
next race will take place
at Wimbledon Common
on the 14th November.
If it rains, it can get very
muddy so keep an eye out
for the weather forecast!
