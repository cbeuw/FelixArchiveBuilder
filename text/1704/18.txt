Misty
N
ever before
have the
politicsofiden-
tity demanded
a spotlight in the media
as they do today. Whilst
this is an undoubtedly
revelatory and welcome
change to Western society
at large, room for the grey
and blurred aspects of
our inner selves must be
made. Arinze Kené’s sear-
ing one man show makes
an admirable attempt to
remind us of this point.
Misty is a layered
performance. Initially
presented as a musical
narrative describing the
harrowing downfall of an
emotionally vulnerable
East Londoner, the play
is paused intermittently
to give Kené the chance
to address the audience
directly and speak of his
internal and external con-
flicts, largely in relation
to identity, during the
writing of the play. We
soon see that these pauses
form the ‘real play’ and
it is certainly here where
the emotional weight of
the performance comes
through. You will whoop
during monologues on
gentrification, feel tense
as his cranial writhing is
displayed physically and
become introspective as
he ponders on his casting
as a “black playwright”.
During the main nar-
rative, spoken word/rap
guides us through London
as the “city creature”. This
is a living being we are
told. A living being where
the “blood cells” and
“viruses” (read: white/
black, resident/gentrifier,
insider/outsider) disrupt
one another’s lives. This
notion of blood cells and
viruses is a clever device
employed by Kené that
gives him room to switch
the play’s tearing focus
from identity to gentrifica-
tion. Questions of who has
the power to define space,
black trauma, notions of
insiders and outsiders
as well as who is in the
position to frame such
questions are all either
directly addressed or
hinted at. A moment must
also be taken to pause
and applaud the music of
Shiloh Coke and Adrian
McLeod that accompa-
nies Kené’s witty, lyrical
rhymes. Their jazz-rap
tones and accomplished
live performances bring
life to London as a “living
creature”.
Kené “just wanted to
write a play”. He didn’t
want it to be an “urban
jungle safari” but equally
he does not see why he
has to answer questions
on whether it is one.
Why must his role as a
playwright be framed in
terms of his identity and
skin colour? He does not
want it to be a complete
political condemnation
of gentrification, yet
he wants to present his
frustration that where he
once had local culture and
small business, he now
has fancy coffees and arty
students. The room for
nuance that Kené claims
for himself, simply by
presenting himself as he
is, proves refreshing in the
age of political extrema.
That being said, at
times, particularly when
tackling gentrification,
there is certainly more to
be said than the Hackney
resident manages to fit in
during his 2 hours.
Ultimately this is an
uplifting play presenting
Kené as his honest self:
a complex, talented
young playwright who
can rap, sing and write. A
testament to nuance and
Kené’s talents, Misty is a
rousing performance that
will have you humming
a tune and pondering
societal issues as you
leave the theatre.
A Beginner’s Guide to Porgy & Bess
I
would like to start
with a confession:
this was my first
opera. My first
exposure was an ama-
teur collection of arias
organised by a friend in a
small opera house in Italy.
Her team’s enthusiasm
made up for their lack of
expertise. Squirming my
way through the first part,
I fled to bask in the golden
evening sun during the
second half. I was an utter
philistine.
Finally relenting to my
Mum’s pleas to join her
at the opera, I went to see
Porgy & Bess, 80 years
after its premiere. Sur-
prisingly, my neighbours
weren’t pretentious opera
aficionados, but fellow
commoners in jeans and
trainers. Perched on the
edge of tiny seats, we
held our breath as the
lights dimmed. The set, a
skeletal shanty-town, was
a long way away from the
decadent, Renaissance
theme I had pictured. It
was stark, geometric and
sharp. A melancholic
voice floated through the
ether. My eyes flicked up
to a screen above the stage,
where surtitles deciphered
the haunting soprano:
“Summertime…”
The tale of Porgy &
Bess is one of incompre-
hensible suffering, a com-
munity buffeted by the
burdens of being black,
poor, female, or disabled.
The plot unleashes with
the arrival of Bess (Nicole
Campbell), the beautiful
girlfriend of ruffian
Crown (Nmon Ford). Our
hero, Porgy (Eric Greene),
is a beggar on crutches, an
incurable romantic with
an invincible optimism. In
the heat of a game of craps
– a brief respite from the
ensemble’s wretched ex-
istence – Crown murders
a man, abandoning Bess
as he takes flight. Cast
out by the community, she
is taken in by Porgy. His
kindness and piety are a
welcome salve to Crown’s
abuse. Sadly, there is
no space for love in this
tale. To save Bess from
Crown’s claws, Porgy
kills the villain and suffers
the subsequent destructive
guilt. He is imprisoned,
returning to find that Bess
has run off with Sporting
Life (Frederick Ballen-
tine), a good-for-nothin’
crack dealer. Porgy makes
pursuit with haste.
Porgy’s heartbreak,
Crown’s depravity, crack
addiction, all these are
rendered more crushing
by the minimalist stage
set and power of the cast’s
voice. Yet the musical
numbers demonstrate
resilience in the face of
trauma. From “A Woman
Is A Sometime Thing” to
“It Ain’t Necessarily So”,
the orchestra used the
melody of spirituals and
seductive jazz to tease the
audience with glimmers
of hope. But just as you
start swinging to the
double entendres, your
heart skips a beat as the
community reels from a
vicious storm.
The English National
Opera has its critics,
though. As a host to
exclusively English-lan-
guage performances,
ENO is accused by purists
of sullying the status
quo of opera performed
in the language it was
composed in. Thankfully,
Porgy & Bess evades
these expectations. The
battle between tradition
and accessibility rages
on. Yet, this particular
performance’s weakness-
es extend beyond general
pedantry. Even to my
untrained ear, Greene and
Campbell’s voices were
outshone by those of their
supporting cast, especially
Latonia Moore as Serena
and Donovan Singletary
as Jake. At times, Camp-
bell’s soprano was more
Miss Piggy than Miss
Porgy. Thankfully the
performance is absolved,
saved, and ameliorated
by the skill of the other
singers, music, and stage
setting.
The poignant story,
the musical harmony of
voice and instrument and
accessibility makes Porgy
& Bess ideal for novices
like me. Opera should be
available to the masses, as
entertainment, escape and
inspiration. So, will opera
always suffer the vestiges
of snobbery? Well, it ain’t
necessarily so!
