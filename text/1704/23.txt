A night at the opera – It’s all Chinese to me!
W
hile most
would con-
sider opera
a strictly
European affair, the China
National Peking Opera
Company would disagree.
Founded in 1955, this
company is one of the
state-funded national in-
stitutions for performing
arts. Peking opera is a
Chinese form of per-
forming arts, developed
from multiple regional
styles in the 19th century
and still very relevant
today. It seamlessly inte-
grates singing, speaking,
dance-acting and combat
into a single finished piece
of art. Although this idea
seems very foreign in the
west, London’s Sadler’s
Theatre saw a perfor-
mance of The Emperor
and the Concubine which,
as well as being entertain-
ing, educated many on
what Peking opera really
is.
Set during the Tang
Dynasty, the opera tells
the story of emperor Tang
Ming Huan (portrayed
by Yu Kuizhi) falling
in love with Taoist nun,
Yang Yuhuan (portrayed
by Li Shengsu). The plot
explores universal themes
of love, power, and class
as the two lovers struggle
with the pressure of the
Imperial palace. Infatuat-
ed with each other, affairs
of state take a back seat,
rebels rise up and drama
ensues.
As the opera starts, a
delicate tune resonates
from the small ensemble
of performers to the left
of the stage, playing a mix
of Western and Chinese
instruments. Eventually,
the curtains do not go
up; instead, a single actor
enters onstage. Despite the
language barrier (although
the entire performance
had subtitles displayed on
screens in the theatre) it is
abundantly clear that this
is a comedic character.
This character, Gao Lishi,
represents the ‘Chou’ or
clown character, one of
the four classic characters
of the Peking opera style.
Actors usually specialise
in one type of role and
train from a very young
age to perfect every
aspect of it. In this case,
the performance was spot
on – the mannerisms, tone
and general attitude were
clearly comedic.
When the curtain finally
rises, the full effect of the
Peking opera style can
be felt. There are women
wearing intricate dresses,
men with large swords in
combat reading positions,
all set against a beautiful
set design depicting the
Imperial Palace. As the
performance got into full
swing, the rising excite-
ment in the theatre was
palpable.
Astylistic choice which
must be characteristic of
Chinese opera was that all
the actors stood extremely
still unless they were part
of the action. Even then,
they would move very
quickly yet elegantly, as
though their movements
served only to illustrate
the snapshots of the
scenes being played out.
Li, the seasoned actress
playing Yuhuan, hardly
moved her mouth when
singing and would move
her feet very fast when
gliding across the floor,
giving the illusion that she
was floating. Although
strange at first, this style
worked well to emphasize
the power structure in the
Chinese court.
The first act ends with
the death of Yuhuan, and
after a 30 minute interval,
the action started up again.
One of the beauties of the
first act was the precision
in the choreography. The
placement and movement
of characters on stage was
orderly. Symmetry was
conserved in every scene.
However, in the second
half, this symmetry starts
to break down, mirroring
the chaos in the plot. The
death of a character in
the second act was one
of the standout moments
of the whole show. The
ingeniously elegant pres-
entation of what is usually
quite a dark subject was
done by draping a scarf
from the actor’s neck
across the entire stage.
Never has self-sacrifice
seemed so chic!
Overall, the first act
seemed rather empty,
especially compared
to the second act. With
numerous intricate martial
art scenes as well as set
designs and choreogra-
phy which painted the
most beautiful pictures,
the second act made the
whole experience worth-
while.
The Emperor and the
Concubine was only
performed in London
twice this October, but
will surely return to the
UK soon – this being the
fourth year the Peking
Opera Company has
performed at Sadler’s
Wells. Although opera
is not everyone’s cup of
tea, it goes without saying
that this is different.
Despite having “opera”
in its name, Peking
opera is so different and
gives audiences so much
more. Not only do the
splendid costumes and ac-
tion-packed scenes make
it a feast for the eyes, the
unique experience gives a
rare glimpse into Chinese
culture and history.
The Monkey King and The Crossroads Inn
T
he Crossroads
Inn, a classic of
Peking opera,
begins with Jiao
Zan, an unjustly exiled
general, being led onstage
in handcuffs by two
soldiers. By the end of
the scene, the handcuffs
are on one of the soldiers
and Jiao Zan (played by
Liu Kuikui) is bossing
the other around – the
audience is in stitches.
But the real stars of the
show are Ren Tanghui
(Wang Haoqiang), a
warrior loyal to the
general, and Liu Lihua
(Liu Bo), the owner of the
Crossroads Inn where Jiao
Zan and the two hapless
soldiers have lodged for
the night. Not knowing
they are on the same side,
Ren and Liu are instantly
suspicious of each other.
What ensues is one of the
most well-known scenes
in Peking opera: the ‘fight
in the dark’ between
Ren and Liu. On a fully
illumined stage, it is up to
the two actors to convey
the idea of ‘darkness’
through their gestures
and mannerisms. Timing
is everything here: as Liu
reaches out, Ren moves
just beyond his grasp; Ren
swings his sword, and Liu
bends over at just the right
moment to avoid being
sliced in half. It is an
elaborate choreography
of missed opportunities
which goes on until Jiao
Zan himself bursts in – a
well-placed kick from
Liu sends him sprawling
as well! A masterpiece of
acrobatic feats disguised
as slapstick comedy. Liu
Bo was particularly im-
pressive in his acrobatics,
with so many front flips
and somersaults that it
was hard to keep track of
where he was.
As is typical of Chinese
opera, each character is a
highly stylised caricature
of what they represent
– the brave warrior, the
down-to-earth innkeeper,
the imposing general. The
animated, stereotyped
movements of the actors,
together with the dramatic
facepaint for each charac-
ter, make it immediately
apparent what their roles
are in the short comedic
sketch. I hardly needed
to glance at the translated
surtitles.
The second play is
just as action-packed as
the first. Drawn from
the popular folk legend
of the Monkey King, it
tells the story of how the
Monkey King and his
companion Zhu Bajie
rescue the daughter of a
wealthy merchant and her
maid from the clutches of
a leopard spirit – by dis-
guising themselves as the
two ladies! Here the full
regalia of Chinese opera is
showcased, with fantasti-
cally elaborate costumes,
gilded headdresses and
yards of flowing fabric.
The falsetto singing of
the actors is also shown
off, accompanied by the
rhythmic cadence of tradi-
tional Chinese percussion
and woodwind such as
the suona. Multiple fight
scenes provide ample
opportunity for the actors
to show off their prowess
in martial arts. We have
a truly jaw-dropping
sequence of spinning leaps
from Liu Lie, who plays
the Leopard, and syn-
chronised spear-throwing
tricks from his troupe of
followers. Ma Yanchao
also makes for an agile
Monkey King, rivalling
Liu in displays of acro-
batic dexterity.
All in all, a top-notch
performance from the
China National Peking
Opera Company, and
a vastly entertaining
cultural experience not to
be missed!
