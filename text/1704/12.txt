Is Elon Musk Making the Biggest Crypto-Giveaway
in the World?
T
hisMonday,more
than a dozen
verified accounts
were hacked into
by scammers imperson-
ating Elon Musk. The
scammers claimed that
they were giving away
10,000 Bitcoin(BTC)
after resigning from the
job of being the director
of Tesla.
“I’m giving 10 000
bitcoin (BTC) to all com-
munity! I left the post of
director of Tesla, thank
you all for your support!
I decided to make the
biggest crypto-giveaway
in the world, for all my
readers who use Bitcoin.
Participate in giveaway -
musk.plus”
On Monday, Twitter
users began to spot some
bizarre posts seemingly
from Musk’s verified
Twitter account. When
they clicked the link to
the giveaway, they were
instructed to transfer 0.1
to 3 BTC (valued current-
ly at about $640-$19,000)
to a wallet for address
verification. In return,
they were promised to be
given 1-30 BTC (valued
currently at $6,400-
$192,000). Through this
scam, the perpetrators
have received more
than $180,000 from 400
people. Dozens of people
sent the bare minimum
of 0.1 BTC requested by
the tweet while some sent
as much as 0.5, 0.75 and
0.9995 BTC (equivalent
to more than $6000).
Amongst the com-
promised accounts are
US publisher Pantheon
Books, UK retailer
Matalan and two dem-
ocratic members of
Congress who were up for
re-election on Tuesday.
On their pages, the decep-
tion was carried out by
changing the image and
display name to Musk’s
and having the blue
‘verified’ checkmark to
the right.
To give them further
credence, the hackers
seem to have used other
compromised accounts,
such as Flex Watches and
Philippines’s National
Disaster Risk Reduction
and Management Council,
to post comments on the
fake Elon Musk tweet.
Some of the comments
include: “+40 BTC, thank
you! For me it is a lot of
money!”, “+25 BTC, I
LOVE YOU ELON!”.
Michigan Rep. Brenda
Lawrence’s account
also seems to have been
hacked as a comment
from that account on a
fake tweet from Rep.
Pallone’s account said: “I
sent 2.7 BTC and got back
54 BTC!”. The tweets
seem to have been taken
down now.
A closer look at the
details would clearly
show, however, that the
tweets were not from
Musk. Instead of having
‘@elonmusk’ to the right
of the blue checkmark,
the profile name varied
depending on the account
that was compromised.
For the past year, Musk
has been a target for
impersonation on Twitter
due to his influence in
the sphere of technology.
A common mode of
attack by scammers is to
disguise their accounts
so that it looks like that
of Musk’s. Then, they
reply to his real tweets
with fake cryptocurrency
offers, making it seem
as if it is all part of the
same thread. This mode
of scamming became
so popular that Twitter
began to lock accounts if
they tried to change their
display names to ‘Elon
Musk’ without mobile
verification. Scammers,
however, continue to be
one step ahead of the
IT team by using other
characters that result in
the display name seeming
to be “Elon Musk” at first
glance.
A Twitter spokesperson
refrained from comment-
ing on the individual
accounts but offered the
following statement
instead:
“Impersonatinganother
individual to deceive
users is a clear violation of
the Twitter Rules. Twitter
has also substantially
improved how we tackle
cryptocurrency scams on
the platform. In recent
weeks, user impressions
have fallen by a multiple
of 10 in recent weeks
as we continue to invest
in more proactive tools
to detect spammy and
malicious activity. This is
a significant improvement
on previous action rates.”
Musk has not com-
mented on this week’s
scam impersonations.
