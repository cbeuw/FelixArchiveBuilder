ICSWP sink, swim and win on Southampton tour

hey say that all
roads lead to
Rome, but it
seems the M3
leads to Southampton:
famous for pretty much
nothing, other than being
the departing location of
the Titanic before it sank.
And so it was, that 19
members of swim-polo
undertook this pilgrimage
with the aim of sinking the
Southampton Water polo
team (and several bever-
ages for good measure).
As this was the first tour
in a decade not to Aachen
in Germany, there was
some confusion over the
fact we were not leaving
the UK. Panic over pass-
ports ensued and the need
to show our national pride
came across strongly.
Top marks to our Russian
teammate Vic, who
donned full Union Jack
face paint but was disap-
pointed not to visit nearby
Salisbury cathedral.
All 19 members took
a boring and uneventful
ferry trip across to the
tropical location of the
Isle of Wight, where the
promise of a hot filling
dinner quickly turned into
a Sainsburys meal deal
and a pint of the best cider
the island had to offer (a
more expensive and worst
tasting version of Frostie
Jacks). Two pubs later
and slightly scarred after
speaking to a man who
managed to fit three sets
of teeth in one mouth, the
team had reached the end
of this long and arduous
crawl and were ready to
leave the island. After
‘missing’ the ferry home,
the decision was made
that swimming home was
maybe a bad idea and the
team took off on a long
0.47 miles hike to reach
an alternative, faster, also
uneventful ferry trip back.

found and a great night
was had by all, especially

Game day. After boun-
tiful amounts of sleep in
uncramped sleeping con-
ditions at a not-5-star Ibis
Budget hotel it was time
to get serious and prepare
for the important match
ahead. Carb loading and
rehydration were essen-
tial, so the team ventured
out of the industrial port
area of Southampton in
search of the local Weth-
erspoons. The group then
split into two teams to get
into the competitive spirit
and make costumes for
the evening in time for
our all-important match.
Unfortunately, one team
got side-tracked by latex
gloves and nutritional
beverages (soup) leaving
them to wear only
plastic bags as their prin-
cess-wear.
In the true spirit of
sportsmanship, we met
the Southampton team at
their student bar before
the match to allow them
a chance to gauge the
opposition.

and mixed matches were
to be played in their
non-BUCS-conforming

to the annoyance of
the Southampton team.
Unfortunately for Joe his
stunning performance in
goal was not enough to
win the attention of the
most objectively good
looking player on the
team. Final score 7-4 to
Imperial.
The final match was
a friendly mixed affair,
giving many players the
chance to try new posi-
tions. Girls goalie Nastya
and mens outfield star
Sam Hanrahan both made
some excellent saves,
proving that size does not,
in fact, always matter. A
lackluster performance
from the remaining
outfield players who were
now suffering from both
fatigue and withdrawal
meant the match conclud-
ed with a draw.
Post match celebrations
took place with full fancy
dress compulsory. South-
ampton earn points here
for very good effort with
their Mel Gibson Brave-
heart impressions. Their
social sec in particular
sparked conversation all
night with his interesting
choice of trunks, which
was considered admirable
by some and threatening
by others. The celebra-
tions then continued to a
true home of debauchery,
Jesters, which made Slug
look like a classy estab-
lishment. The night ended
with a visit to a local 24
hour curry house proposed
by the Southampton team,
knowing full well that
ICSWP can never say no
to a curry. Shoutout to
Manzels curry house for
making the strongest naan
breads in the south of
England.
After some well-earned
rest, a tasty pizza, and
a brief walking tour of
Southampton’s historic
walls, it was time to leave.
Thank you to Ozzie and
Alice for organising such
a cultural experience.
