ESG investing, is it really worth it?
G
lobal Warming.

War. Poverty.
These are all
problems every human on
the face of the earth must
deal with, and it is some-
thing everyone should be
tackling. The financial
industry has decided to
combat these problems
with Environmental,
Social and Governance
(ESG) Investing. It is
investing standards
that indicates whether
a company has strong
ethical and sustainable
practices. Investors who
wish to buy these stocks
for their portfolio do so
through socially respon-
sible mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds.
Some argue that this
breaches asset managers’
duty to focus solely
on investment returns,
however, comparing the
annualized 5-year return
on the MSCI Europe Index
at 13.5% with the more
sustainable MSCI Europe
SRI Index at 14.87%,
many think that returns
are actually greater.
Furthermore, looking
at the bigger picture,
climate change will
continue to cost the world
economy more and more.
According to the UN In-
tergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, extreme
weather and the health
impact of burning fossil
fuels cost the American
economy at least $240bn a
year over the past decade.
By 2030, the report
estimates that the loss of
productivity caused by a
hotter world could cost
the global economy $2trn.
Fortunately, BlackRock is
estimating that the ESG
investment market will
grow 16-fold, from $25bn
to $400bn, over the next
decade. The difficultly
comes in integrating ESG
in a standardised way
into financial products.
Responsible investing is
a complex area with no
fixed definitions, says
Daniel Ung, head of smart
beta strategy for the SPDR
fund range at State Street
Global Advisors. While it
is simple to screen tobacco
companies and weapon
manufacturers out of the
equation, it is harder to
sift through stocks that
are managing to transition
to low-carbon economy
well. This filtering effect
may also have unexpected
repercussions. Charlie
Robertson of Renaissance
Capital, argues that ESG
criteria could skew capital
flows towards the most
privileged parts of the
world, making it harder
for less developed coun-
tries to escape poverty
and in turn prevent them
from progressing towards
environmental and social
governance. Mr Robert-
son suggests that, instead,
investors should adopt
economic relativism.
Investors should judge
a country relative to the
GDP per person, recognis-
ing that Chile, Indonesia
and Poland are all unusu-
ally virtuous given their
stage of development. On
the other hand, it is well
known that foreign in-
vestment in a country can
be overrated as a source
of growth. Ashley Taylor
of the World Bank thinks
that emerging economies
benefit from foreign in-
vestment only if they pass
a certain threshold of in-
stitutional quality, which
many emerging markets
don’t. Maybe if investors
starve these markets of
fickle foreign capital,
it may be a blessing in
disguise, forcing them to
stand on their own two
feet.
From bad to worse for Puma Biotechnology
I
f you want a good ex-
ample of how volatile
biotechnology stocks
canbe,looknofurther
than Puma Biotechnology
Inc. This cancer-focused
biotechnology company
was founded 8 years
ago and went public in
2012 with shares trading
around $10 per share.
In 2014 that share price
rocketed to +$260 follow-
ing positive clinical trials
for the breast cancer drug
Nerlynx, which contribut-
ed towards the company’s
valuation at $10 billion.
Following this, mixed re-
search results and delays
in approval processes
have caused the company
share price to swing
wildly with the stock price
plummeting almost 80%
this year. Shares plunged
a further 48% on Friday
2nd November after the
company reported disap-
pointing sales of $52.6
millionforNerlynx,below
expectations of $58.1
million. Furthermore,
Puma Biotech indicated
that the percentage of
patients who discontinued
the use of Nerlynx as a
result of adverse events
had increased to about
18%, which only added
to the sell-off. The good
news for shareholders is
that this massive sell-off
is probably overdone.
Nerylnx’s sales are likely
to increase as the drug
becomes more globally
used, which may indicate
that this stock is currently
at a bargain price.
