AmericanMidterms:TacticalDefeat,Strategic
Victory for the Democrats
Below their supposedly average performance, the Democratic Party have drawn the lines for
a win over Trump and the Republicans in 2020.

L
ast Tuesday,
Americans went
to the poll to
vote for a third
of their Senators, all
their Representatives,
36 governors and most
state senators and state
representatives in the
country. The Felix read-
ership probably knows
the two main takeaways:
while the Democrats were
successful in their attempt
to capture the House of
Representatives (having
a net gain of 28 seats,
so far, that gives them a
majority in the chamber),
the GOP was able to not
only maintain the Senate,
but gain 2 more Senators,
possibly 3 when Florida
publishes its results. Thus,
both sides could claim a
victory of some kind, and
it is true that this feels like
a moderate success for a
Republican Party that has
the most controversial and
divisive president in the
last 70 years as one of their
own. However, a more
careful analysis reveals
that the Democrats laid
the lines for an overhaul
of American politics in
the post-Trump era. Let’s
find out why this is the
case by looking into the
most important results of
the night:
House:
The Dems have built
their new majority in
mainly three states (New
Jersey, Pennsylvania
and Virginia), usually in
swing districts where the
Trump brand of politics
has proved to be toxic.
However, they got sur-
prisingly strong results
in more conservative
states like Florida, Texas,
Oklahoma and Kansas.
While out of these only
Florida will be in play
in the 2020 election, the
improved vote share in
Texas reveals that the state
is indeed drifting away
from the GOP, to the point
it may become the swing
state by mid-century. It
is also remarkable that
the Dems were able to
gain districts in Michigan
and Iowa, states they will
most certainly need if
they want to defeat Trump
in two years’ time. In
other matters, controlling
the House means that
Nancy Pelosi will become
Speaker for a second time,
and that the investigation
on Russian collusion with
the Trump campaign in
2016 will have to pass
through the Dem con-
trolled House Judiciary
Committee.
Senate:
While it is true that the
chances of them taking
this chamber were very
low due to the idiosyncra-
sy of the seats in play, the
Dems had a bittersweet
night in the Senate. They
managed to flip Nevada
and keep Montana, but
in turn they lost Indiana,
North Dakota and
Missouri, and possibly
Florida, according go
provisional results. Par-
ticularly painful were the
close defeats in Arizona
and Texas (the last one a
nail-biting battle between
progressive darling and
future presidential con-
tender Beto O’Rourke
,and alleged serial killer
extraordinaire Ted Cruz).
Nevertheless, it must be
remembered that these
two states have not elected
a Democrat in a statewide
election since the 90s,
so the swing towards the
party of Roosevelt spells
of potential success in
future races. The re-elec-
tion of Dem Senators in
Pennsylvania, Michigan
and Ohio also reveals
that the Trump takeover
of the Mid-West in 2016
may have been a once in
a lifetime event for the
GOP.
Governorships:
Big night again for the
Dems, but it could have
been even bigger. Pickups
from the Republicans
include Michigan, Maine,
Nevada, New Mexico and
Illinois, and, more sur-
prisingly, Kansas, a very
conservative state where
Chris Kobach, the infa-
mously xenophobic GOP
candidate, was defeated
by Democratic rising star
Laura Kelly. However, the
price of the night proved to
be Wisconsin. There, Tea-
Party-backed union buster
and 2016 presidential can-
didate Scott Walker failed
to get re-elected against
schoolteacher Tony Evers.
Despite these victories in
the North of the country,
the Dems were defeated
by a small margin in
Florida and Georgia,
states where they run
charismatic, progressive
black challengers against
GOP administrations
that have been widely
accused of using vote dis-
enfranchisement tactics
to maintain their grip on
power.
Other results:
Lesser (but not less
important!) races solidi-
fied the narrative that the
country is moving left. In
Florida, voters approved
the electoral reenfran-
chisement of more
than 1.5 million former
felons, while Idaho, Utah
and Nebraska passed
Medicaid expansion that
improves the healthcare
of the poorest members
of society. Among other
progressive initiatives
that were voted in include
the legalisation of rec-
reational marihuana in
Michigan; endorsement
of a law banning discrimi-
nation against transgender
people in Massachusetts,
and maintaining sanctuary
for illegal immigrants in
Oregon. Last but not least,
GOP-controlled Arkansas
and Missouri voted to
substantially raise the
minimum wage.
