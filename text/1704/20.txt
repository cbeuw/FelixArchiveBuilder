(Not) Running Away
Race and Mental Health
M
addie is
your typical
millennial,
with typical
millennial problems: a
job she doesn’t really care
about, a boyfriend she
isn’t sure she loves, and
approaching the big 3-0.
She’s spent her whole life
doing things in half meas-
ures, not quite knowing
what it is she wants or
having the drive to get
it. And that’s what’s led
her here, to the start of a
26-mile marathon, despite
never having run even
half that distance.
This is the premise
of It’s Not A Sprint:
a clever metaphor of
a woman forced to
confront everything in
life she’s been running
away from through a
marathon she randomly
chooses to commit to.
It’s a one-woman show,
with writer and actress
Grace Chapman alone on
stage, accompanied by the
voice of an off-stage actor
playing what can only be
described as Maddie’s
inner voice. It initially
seems like a cheap
gimmick, but their chem-
istry is such that it works.
The play explores several
threads to Maddie’s life.
As the marathon marks
a crisis brought on by
her 30th birthday, it goes
without saying that age
features heavily in all of
her thoughts. Foremost
is her relationship with
long-term boyfriend, Phil.
They’ve been together for
5 years and Phil wants
to take the next step, but
Maddie isn’t sure what
her answer is. Maddie’s
thoughts about Phil are
linked inextricably to her
fertility – she’s certainly
not in a rush to have kids,
but soon realises that her
biological clock is ticking.
The moments where
Maddie works against
her anxiety about this,
forcing herself to bring
the thought of children
closer and closer to the
present, are amongst the
best of the show.
The premise of It’s
Not a Sprint is definitely
a good one, but the story
and script let it down.
Despite being the main
topic of Maddie’s worries
we find out little about
Phil, and not a great deal
about their relationship.
Halfway through it is
revealed Maddie is having
an affair. It’s clear the
late reveal is intended for
dramatic effect, but it ends
up coming off shallow and
unfeeling. Why should
we care about this affair
if even Maddie doesn’t
seem too focused on it?
The staging is effective,
but that’s about it. It’s
simple and it supports
the premise, there isn’t
anything that particularly
adds to the performance,
but certainly nothing that
takes away from it. Grace
Chapman is a strong
performer; she’s funny
and relatable as Maddie
and has the strength to
carry the solo show on her
shoulders, managing to
convey a restless energy
that makes Maddie’s
marathon feel all too real.
In the end It’s Not A
Sprint is serviceable; it’s
a decent hour’s entertain-
ment, but sadly nothing
more. Chapman is fun to
watch and the premise is
interesting, but when you
dig deeper, there’s nothing
here that’s particularly
insightful or memorable.
I
nspired by the story of
William Freeman, the
first man in America
to plead insanity in
court, Freeman explores
the ways in which system-
ic racism and attitudes to
mental health have been
intertwined throughout
history. This collaboration
between writer Camilla
Whitehill and theatre
company Strictly Arts
hones in on this somewhat
neglected link in history,
using six different stories
spanning several centuries
to shine a light on the
issue.
Central to the play
is Freeman, a young
black man wrongfully
imprisoned in the 1800s
and subjected to extreme
violence in prison, who
later goes on to kill four
people. Despite a plea
of insanity due to severe
brain damage, Freeman
was found guilty and
sentenced to death. Other
storiesarepainfullyrecent,
including that of Sandra
Bland, found hanged in
her cell in 2015 following
an arrest for a traffic
offence. On the surface
these cases are worlds
apart, but dig deeper and
we find systemic racism
and mental health issues
at play in both cases. We
jump between stories,
gaining urgency as the
play progresses and we
move forward in time.
Director Daniele Steven-
son is a master of pacing,
transitioning between
stories in a way that builds
in intensity.
To say the cast are
fantastic would be a gross
understatement. Each
member of the 6 strong
cast is truly a force to be
reckoned with; there is
no weak link to be found
here. They establish their
amazing chemistry within
the first scene as we open
to a scene of bodies,
lifting, lunging and
throwing themselves over
each other. The staging
is equally fantastic.
Lighting is used to great
effect throughout the play
as we cut in and out of
darkness rapidly at points.
At one point a character’s
internal struggles are
depicted using a strug-
gling shadow puppet and
in a different scene three
of the actors form a horse
with their bodies, which
is then ridden by another
cast member. These
should feel like isolated
gimmicks, but Daniele
Stevenson does incredibly
well at bringing together
seemingly disparate
elements to create a richer
whole.
Freeman is what
theatre is all about. In no
other medium could you
combine dance, shadow
puppetry, poetry and
singing with acting in the
way that Freeman does.
There is also a real sense of
political urgency: for too
long things have remained
the same; despite the years
nothing has changed. It’s
clearly a play that rose
from the desire to convey
a message, but Freeman
rises above this message
to form an artistic mas-
terpiece in its own right.
This is certainly not one
to miss!
