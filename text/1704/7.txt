An ‘exploding’ political atmosphere

and the implications it has for democracy

On Wednesday 24th
October, news broke of
suspicious packages con-
taining explosives mailed
to former President
Barack Obama and former
Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton. Similar packages
were quickly discovered,
addressed to:
George Soros: billion-
aire investor and Demo-
cratic mega-donor
John Brennan: former
CIA Director (the package
was found in CNN’s Man-
hattan office, which was
then evacuated)
Eric Holder: former
Attorney General (the
package was misad-
dressed and found at the
office of Democratic
Congresswoman Debbie
Wasserman Schultz in
Florida, which was the
return address listed on all
the packages)
Maxine Waters: Dem-
ocratic Representative
from California (two
packages were addressed
to her)
Joe Biden: former
Democratic Vice Presi-
dent
Robert De Niro: actor,
who has been highly
critical of Trump’s presi-
dency
James Clapper:
former National Intelli-
gence Director
Cory Booker: Demo-
cratic Senator from New
Jersey
Kamala Harris:
Democratic Senator from
California
Tom Steyer: billionaire
investor and Democratic
mega-donor.
Each of these packages
contained a pipe-bomb,
sent in a padded manila
envelope, with the return
address written to Dem-
ocratic Representative
of Florida Debbie Was-
serman Schultz for all
thirteen envelopes. None
of the bombs detonated
and no injuries occurred.
The packages, when
discovered, were imme-
diately sent to the FBI lab
in Quantico, Virginia for
analysis.
On Friday, the Justice
Department arrested
Cesar Altieri Sayoc Jr, the
Trump enthusiast from
Florida who had mailed
these packages. Author-
ities were able to pin
down his identity using
fingerprints and DNA that
he had left on the bombs.
His social media accounts
were also used to corrobo-
rate his crime: his Twitter
displayed misspellings
of “Hillary Clinton” as
“Hilary Clinton”, and
“Schultz” as “Shultz”,
the same misspellings
as on the envelopes. His
Facebook showed photos
of him attending 2016
presidential campaign
rallies for Trump, un-
derscoring the trend of
who the bombs were sent
to – the targets have all
been subjects of Trump’s
Twitter feed and rally
rhetoric. Trump depicts
Hillary as a “criminal”,
George Soros as an “evil
man”, Robert De Niro and
Maxine Waters as “very
low IQ individual[s]”…
Sayoc had been living
in his van at the time
they found him. His van
is plastered with pro-
Trump stickers: a sticker
of Hillary Clinton’s face
with a target on it, “CNN
Sucks”, headlines re-
porting the jobs numbers
Trump has boosted. He
was also reported to have
a hit list of a hundred
potential targets.
It seems no surprise
that it was a man like
Sayoc behind these at-
tempted bombings. The
mainstream media is often
a maelstrom of heated
rhetoric, where the words
are acknowledged and
understood for what they
are – just rhetoric. There
are, however, people
like Sayoc who have a
blurred sense of where
the boundary lies between
reality and rhetoric, who
take everything word for
word, who are mentally
susceptible to extreme
suggestions and are
prompted to act on them.
A look into Sayoc’s life
proves this easily. Sayoc
has travelled the country
leading a mixed-race
troupe of male exotic
dancers; he has had
multiple run-ins with the
law which included past
attempted bombings; he
once filed for bankrupt-
cy, and revealed on the
bankruptcy filing that
he lived with his mother
and owned no furniture
(he is 57 years old); his
mothers and sisters have
encouraged him to seek
medical treatment for his
“lack of comprehension
of reality”. The Justice
Department had found and
arrested Sayoc at a strip
club where he worked as
a DJ.
This is not to say that
mentally susceptible
people are to blame and
the American political
atmosphere should not be
toned down on both sides.
The rhetoric on both
sides needs urgently to be
cooled down. Before the
perpetrator’s identity had
been revealed, Republi-
cans were certain that the
bombs were a false-flag
operation orchestrated
by Democrats – meaning
that they sent the bombs
to themselves – in order
to boost mid-term results,
and liberals were quick to
blame Trump as the direct
and only cause of these
attempted bombings.
In characteristic
fashion, both sides had
pushed the blame onto
each other without seeing
that their reaction only
spurs further rage across
the aisle. The immediate
accusation from Repub-
licans that it was a false
flag-operation allows
right-wingers to believe
that ill will can only exist
in people who disagree
with them. The claims
from Democrats that
Trump, and only Trump,
is responsible for spread-
ing charged and hostile
rhetoric is hypocritical;
Hillary Clinton said in
a speech on the 10th of
October, only two weeks
before the pipe-bombs,
“you cannot be civil with
a political party that wants
to destroy what you stand
for”.
Furthermore, though
this level of political
violence has reached a
new high, its history has
not been exclusive to
either side of the spectrum.
In 2017, left-wing activist
James Hodgkinson shot
at Congressman Steve
Scalise during a Congres-
sional baseball practice
session. Hodgkinson had
attended presidential
campaign rallies for
Bernie Sanders in 2016,
and was a member of
multiple Facebook groups
such as “The Road To Hell
Is Paved With Republi-
cans”. More recently, in
September, a Californian
man was indicted for
making numerous calls
to The Boston Globe
threatening to shoot and
kill their journalists. His
reasons, as explained
by him, were “because
you are the enemy of the
people . . . as long as you
keep attacking the presi-
dent… I will continue to
threat, harass, and annoy
the Boston Globe.”
These 13 pipe-bombs,
addressed to some of
President Trump’s most
outspoken and famous
critics, would have seized
the spotlight for at least
a week in any other
time or country. But this
attempted terrorist attack
was quickly swept from
America’s attention when,
three days after the pipe-
bombs were reported, a
mass shooting occurred at
a synagogue in Pittsburgh
that left eleven dead.
The simmering rage
of America’s culture and
politics war has clearly
hit a pressure point, a
moment that was likely
provoked by Brett Kavan-
agh’s recent confirmation
to the Supreme Court
and the consequential
midterm elections that
have occurred this week.
