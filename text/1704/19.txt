Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor
Having bravely taken
the stairs in Covent
Garden, navigated my
way through the busy and
colourful streets towards
Leicester Square, I locate
the theatre (and Claire)
and, on arriving, obliging-
ly open my bag to show
the doorman. Lab coat,
safety goggles, notebook,
endlesspens.Weexchange
an understanding nod
and I’m inside – at the
opera! Everyone we pass
is elegantly dressed. We
wind our way up to the
Dress Circle and enter the
beautiful theatre, heavily
decorated in intricate red
and gold. I take my seat
and even though it hasn’t
started I’m already feeling
relaxed, enjoying the je
ne sais quoi that is the
glamour of the opera.
The lights dim for
the third run of Director
DavidAlden’s production,
Lucia di Lammermoor at
the London Coliseum. I
must confess it felt rather
odd to set the very Italian
sounding Raimondo,
Normanno and Enrico
in nineteenth century
Scotland, but once I got
over that the whole thing
was rather enjoyable.
The story opens with
Enrico’s plan to marry
poor Lucia to Arturo
– only to discover that
she is in love with the
rather charismatic, kilt-
clad reprobate Edgardo.
Despite his obvious
character flaws, naïve
Lucia is besotted with him
(as are we). She appears
very young indeed, with
her rag dolls and her long
bloomers peeking out
from under her skirt as
she tiptoes playfully along
the windowsill, but this
only makes us empathise
with her all the more
as we watch her being
manipulated and taken
advantage of throughout
the opera. Manipulated by
her brother into marrying
Arturo, Lucia is driven to
madness and eventually
meets a bitter end.
Despite her obvious
youth, or perhaps because
of it, I found Lucia sur-
prisingly relatable. No,
my brother isn’t trying to
marry me off to a wealthy
count, and no, I’m not
pining for my seemingly
unfaithful Scottish lover
gone to France, but it felt
as if there were some-
thing real about Lucia’s
emotional reactions to the
impossible situation she
finds herself in.
Special mentions must
go to Eleazar Rodríguez as
Edgardo, and Sarah Tynan
as Lucia, who really steals
the show, demonstrating
both incredible skill and
playfulness in her librettos
in the first act. The set was
brilliant; a Brontë-esque
mansion designed by
Charles Edwards, ever so
slightly dilapidated with
high windows for char-
acters to leap in and out
of. I also loved the use of
children’s toys throughout
scenes with Lucia, which
I felt perfectly mirrored
the way in which Enrico
treated Lucia; a plaything,
a doll, something that he
could control and own.
On my way home (via
Leicester Square this time
to avoid those notorious
stairs at Covent Garden) I
feel quite satisfied. A trip
to the English National
Opera delights the senses,
taking you on an emotion-
al and intellectual journey
but leaving you feeling
relaxed and luxuriated at
the same time. Despite the
fanciful nature of the plot,
I found something quite
relatable in the plight of
poor Lucia, allowing me
to experience something
of all of her emotions;
love, betrayal, despair...
If you have never been
to an opera, you’ve got to
go; there’s really nothing
quite like it.
The Wild Duck
There is no warning, no
dimming of lights when
the play begins; instead,
Kevin Harvey casually
walks on stage, mic in
hand, and starts talking
about the history of The
Wild Duck, a play written
in 1884 by the acclaimed
Norwegian playwright
Henrik Ibsen. It’s almost
like a pre-theatre lecture.
There is truth and there are
lies, he says, and seeking
the ‘original’ version of
the play is a lie – we’ve
lost the societal context
of 19th century Norway
long ago. Then he puts
down the mic, slips into
the character of Gregory
Woods, and the play has
begun before we know it.
Robert Icke’s interpre-
tation of Ibsen’s classic
is certainly updated for
a 21st century audience.
Names are Anglicised,
professions modernised.
Håkon Werle, the whole-
sale merchant, becomes
Charles Woods, the
wealthy investment trader.
There is frequent breaking
of the fourth wall, with
the microphone serving
as the switch between
in-character dialogue and
audience asides. This
is subverted as the play
goes on and events spiral
increasingly out of the
characters’ control. “End
scene. END SCENE!”
Gregory/Harvey bellows
into the mic, but just as
Gregory has lost control
over the events in the
play, Harvey also loses
the power to direct what is
happening on stage.
It’s a clever trick, but
like much in Icke’s ren-
dition, it seems too facile.
Ibsen’s play is a nuanced
exploration of truth,
illusions, and the poten-
tially destructive power of
conceited idealism. With
Icke, nuance goes out the
window. The audience
doesn’t have to guess what
the characters are actually
thinking; all subtext is
conveniently explained
via running comments
into the ever-handy mi-
crophone. Of course, this
means Ibsen’s wonderful
dramatic irony goes out
the window too – a joke
isn’t funny when you have
to explain it.
Nowhere is the loss of
ambiguity more apparent
than in the ending. Will
the tragic events of the
play be a driving force
for James Ekdal to turn
his life around, or will he
relapse into his old weak
ways? Ibsen’s original
leaves it open, but here
we are told grimly that
scarcely a year passes
before James forgets the
purity of Hedwig’s sac-
rifice, and that Gregory
ends up hanging himself.
It is all very neat and
nicely packaged: extreme
idealism is bad. Happy
delusion is better than
harsh reality.
Despite Icke’s heavy-
handed treatment, the end
result is still a powerful
performance. Much of
this is down to the cast –
Harvey makes a brilliant
Gregory, passionately
misguided in his own
beliefs, while Edward
Hogg excels in his role of
theinsecure,self-absorbed
James with fantasies of
self-importance. Dramatic
tension gradually builds
up as the web of lies sur-
rounding the Ekdal family
is revealed, and by the end
of the fourth act it hangs
in the air like a string
about to snap. Clara Read
gives a heart-wrenching
portrayal of Hedwig, the
young Ekdal daughter
key to much of the plot’s
intrigue. The intimate
setting of the Almeida
Theatre heightens the in-
tensity of the minimalistic
production; members of
the cast emerge from the
stalls and theatregoers’
possessions are borrowed
as props in the play.
This Ibsen-inspired
production is definitely
still worth a watch, but
I’d recommend viewers
read the original play
after. Unlike Icke, I’d
like to think the 21st-cen-
tury audience is just as
capable of appreciating
its thought-provoking
subtleties as the audience
of two centuries ago.
