Shitty Old Car Doesn’t Break!
HANGMAN
Students find some
success in event
exclusively for great-
grandfathers and
their half-million-
pound vehicles

B
oanerges, the
CGCU mas-
cot vehicle,
who has been
breaking down almost
daily since 1902, some-
how made it to Brighton
after a 41-hour all night
effort to get him going.
In true engineering style,
this just goes to show
that 365 days to finish
a piece of coursework
will still result in an all
nighter: he wasn’t run-
ning until 6am, which is
less than ideal for a 7am
start. The late night was
partly due to delays on
waiting for materials; it
was fortunate that, at the
last minute, sufficient
brass could be repur-
posed from RSM’s Davy
lamp (see last week’s
Hangman) to form the
crankshaft bearings.
He follows a similar
fate to the rest of the
mascots of Imperial’s
constituent unions: no one
sees them and no one cares
anyway. If you joined
Imperial last year, you
thankfully wouldn’t have
heard the two cylinder
clash outside the Union
every Wednesday, though
inside the Union you’ll
see a similar amount of
spluttering and keeling
over. For all the lack of
success of the Guilds,
the School of Mines once
again came out worse.
After two years of inac-
tion, Clem, their vehicular
mascot, shagged its gears
in an attempt to keep up
with Bo last weekend.
Ed Speared, Bo driver,
says, “I owe it all to
Matthew, the real Bo
driver, for he keeps both
my head and my car spin-
ning”.Thiswasacomment
about Matthew Iceberg,
last year’s Bo driver,
who wasted his third year
between Shepherd’s Bush
and Slough in an attempt
to find even worse places
to spend his time engi-
neering.
This is the first and only
success that the CGCU
will ever have, though
not every Guildsman got
to celebrate it: Party Bits,
one member of Team Bo
who spent a considerable
amount getting him back
to full health, said he
“didn’t expect the car to
make the fifty mile drive”
so he “decided to get drunk
watching the fireworks on
a kayak instead”.
