Hands up if you like being absolutely scared shitless
This is like nothing you’ve ever heard before. Heavy and harrowing noise rock akin to a horror movie - not the
soundtrack, but the movie itself. Gore and all.
P
reface to this
review: I’ve
never been into
heavy music, but
I love horror films. It’s
undeniably a bit insane
to subject yourself to two
hours of fear (I recently
saw Hereditary in the
cinema and thought I was
going to die), but the vis-
ceral emotion good horror
elicits is what makes it
so addictive. With this
album I discovered that,
similar to watching a
scary movie, listening to
terrifying music can be a
lot of (harrowing and kind
of traumatising) fun.
I’ve tried to listen to
Black Metal and similar
genres, but I’m always
put off by how disgusting
and deliberately off-put-
ting they sound: demonic
screaming, pummelling
drums, Satanic lyrics.
If a typical Black Metal
album (see: Behemoth)
were a horror film, it’d
be gory and vile, evoking
emotion primarily by re-
pulsing you. Hostel, Saw,
The Human Centipede
are films that fall into this
category, and I have little
to no interest in them.
In stark contrast, You
Won’t Get What You Want
evokes terror and nihilism,
but not by disgusting
you. Instead, it feels far
more psychological and
internal; nothing repulsive
or gory happens, there
are no demons or Satanic
cults. Instead, the fear
comes from within, the ex-
istential horror that comes
from facing your own
insignificance, feeling
panic and despair at the
pointlessness of it all. The
horror is the knowledge
that everything can fall
apart, that you’re only one
bad day away from losing
it all. This comparatively
mundane and grounded
horror is evident in the
singing; instead of the
blasphemous growls and
screams of Black Metal,
here the singer sounds
human, relatable, but full
of fear and pain, on the
verge of breakdown.
“There isn’t
a glimpse of
optimism or
hope to be
found here;
it’s forty-eight
minutes of
despair”
four minutes consist of
sparse, discomforting and
erratic drum bursts, with
anunrelentingguitardrone
and disquieting lyrics
that fill you with dread.
In the final few minutes,
the song explodes into a
hellish wall of sound, and
the insanity only increases
first few times I heard it.
It’s relentless and night-
marish, and somehow
evokes the feeling of
being chased, or perhaps
of running from yourself.
After a few more
intensely visceral songs,
‘Less Sex’ is a much
earned breather, with
that are oddly pretty, and
this eventually transforms
into a melody that is
legitimately gorgeous,
and feels like coming
up for air after nearly
drowning in the horror of
the previous songs.
‘Ocean Song’ is an
incredible highlight; a
narrative-driven sev-
en-minute descent into
madness, telling the story
of a man returning from
work and being overcome
with a terrible fear. The
cosmic horror the protag-
onist feels is thoroughly
Lovecraftian; it feels like
the end of the world is
near. The instrumental is
reminiscent of a Swans
track, with a repetitive
and hypnotising bass line
and chanted lyrics that
feel like voices in the head
of a man who has finally
snapped. The character
sprints through the streets
in fear, and it feels like
you’re right there with
him.
The final song ‘Guest
House’ is an insanely bold
and horrifying way to
end the album. The lyrics
depict a situation straight
out of a nightmare;
someone is pounding
desperately on your cellar
door, asking who locked
them out and begging
you to “let me in” with
gut-wrenching screams of
fear and pain. The terror
in their voice is palpable
and awful to behold,
evoking sympathy but
also visceral fear.
The surprising thing
about this collection of
harrowing songs is just
how incredibly capti-
vating they are. They
are accessible enough to
be enjoyed, whilst still
containing freakish and
disorientating walls of
sound, evil twisting guitar
lines that make you feel
like you’re descending
into a bottomless pit,
and desperate, emotive
singing that makes you
fear for the man who you
can hear falling apart.
I’m terrified when I play
the album, but I’m on the
edge of my seat.

falling apart, and there is

The opener, ‘City
Song’, perfectly lays the
foundation for the horror
that is to come. The first
with the following tracks.
‘Long Road, No
Turns’ is so horrifying
and demented it becomes
incredibly compelling. It
also honestly made me the
a dark, brooding and
ominous melody that
sounds like an evil version
of Elbow’s ‘Grounds for
Divorce’. There are brief
walls of chaotic noise
This album sounds like
what it must feel like to
go insane. It sounds like
the quiet horror of an
average person’s exist-
ence has finally become
too much, their psyche
shatters, and everything
unravels. There isn’t a
glimpse of optimism or
hope to be found here;
it’s forty-eight minutes
of despair. There are cli-
mactic peaks of absolute
mania and calmer troughs
of quiet dread, but there’s
no escaping the overall
message; everything is

An album to cure your autumnal anguish
T
he nights are
colder, the days
are shorter, and
there isn’t much
new music being released.
Guess what I’m most
upset about. As the icy
winter chill grows, my
mind has gone back to one
of my favourite albums
of the summer just gone,
Slide by George Clanton.
Clanton’s been creating
for years but mostly
under different names.
As Mirror Kisses Clanton
released chillwave music
and as ESPRIT 空想 he
released vapourwave.
In Slide, Clanton draws
from previous work but
also from genres such as
breakbeat, electronic pop
and indie pop.
Nowthisisnotmyusual
kind of music, but the
mosaic of synths, beats,
samples, vocals and in-
strumentation is so intox-
icatingly lush I couldn’t
help but become addicted.
The album opens with
‘Livin’ Loose’. You’re
immediately struck by the
sound of glassy chimes
with the reverb turned
right up, it’ll reflect and
bounce around the inside
of your head in the nicest
way possible. A sax then
“improvises” over top,
followed by reverbed
and echoed vocals by
Clanton. If heaven exists,
this is what you hear as
you ascend to the golden
gates.
As the song goes on
the layers build, including
a dance beat and some
nice gritty bass synths,
and it gains a powerful
momentum; something
Clanton is really good at.
None of the elements in
his songs are especially
loud or forceful but his
skill in layering and
mixing means that all
the pieces fit perfectly
together to create a full
sound.
Clanton also demon-
strates impressive versa-
tility between the styles
of his songs. There’s
a selection of more
electronic based tracks
with stretching synths,
low-pitched percussion,
catchy loops and swelling
choruses. Some tracks
are more acoustic using
live recordings of drum
kits and distorted guitars.
Other tracks are ethereal
in nature. The track ‘Blast
Off’ has falling arpeggios
and sweeping strings
which work well as a cool
down from the previous
track ‘Dumb’, which is
the roughest on the album.
The tracks ‘Make It
Forever’, ‘You Lost Me
There’, ‘Encore’, and
‘Walk Slowly’ all have
the same chord sequence,
two of them share the
same BPM and almost
identical lyrics. However,
all four songs manage to
sound either somewhat
or entirely different to
each other. While this
isn’t executed perfectly,
and does feel like a bit of
a cheat, you do have to
give credit where credit is
due, because I’ve listened
to these same four tracks
more times than I’d care
to admit and I’m nowhere
near sick of them.
As much as I love this
album it is lacking in
places. Clanton’s lyrics
can be interesting and
creative but the types
of stories he tells don’t
venture out of love or
heartbreak. Despite my
compliments about the
album’s diversity I can’t
help but want more. I
really do feel cheated that
four of the songs use the
same chord sequence in
such an obvious way and
while the sounds Clanton
is working with are beau-
tiful there is definitely
room for expansion.
Regardless I love this
album because it carries
a bit of 2018’s summer,
exactly what I’ve been
needing to combat my
winter woes.
Samm Henshaw takes us to church
I
recently had the
pleasure of being in
attendance as Samm
Henshaw treated fans
to a phenomenal one-off
show.
Samm Henshaw rose to
popularity following the
success of his two-part
Sound Experiment EP
projects, the most recent
of which was released in
2016. Samm has since
largely been on the road,
touring in support of
the likes of Chance the
Rapper, who hand-picked
him for the European leg
of the Coloring Book tour.
Although it has been
over two years since he
last released a project,
Samm has steadily been
whetting fans’ appetites
through the relase of
singles all throughout
2018. He kicked off his
set with one such single,
asking the crowd, “how
are we all feeling?”
before launching into
the anthemic ‘How Does
It Feel?’. This had the
crowd rocking and the
energy levels remained
high as he performed a
plethora of unreleased
tracks (look out for new
track ‘Church’ when it
drops) and his more recent
single, ‘Broke’. Things
took a soulful turn as he
slowed things down with
classic Sound Experiment
favourites, ‘Better’ and
‘Redemption’. The per-
formance of ‘Only Wanna
Be with You’ was particu-
larly special.
The show ended with
a bang as Samm brought
out Wretch 32 to perform
their collaboration,
‘Doubt’. With his debut
album surely on the
horizon, if you don’t know
about Samm Henshaw,
get to know!
