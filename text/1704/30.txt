This week you’re feeling
rather spontaneous. You
decide to book a weekend
trip out of London to
Scunthorpe.
Why, poor child?
Imperial can’t be that
bad.

Dear Felicity,
All my friends are
vegan and make
me feel guilty for
destroying the planet
every time I want a
burger. What do I do?
Yours,
Mea T
Felicity Felissy
Agony Aunt
Hi Mea,
That sounds like quite
the predicament. From
my understanding of the
situation, you are stuck
at a crossroads with two
obvious options. Your
first option is to go on as
you are, enjoying deli-
cious burgers, barbecues
and bovril, but forfeiting
the moral highground to
your friends. Your second
option is a rocky one: give
up meat, dairy and leather
and enjoy gloating about
it but never eat a mozza-
rella stick again. There
is, however, a Middle
WayTM
. It looks green
but is actually paved
with thyme seasoning
for roast chicken. How
about you just say you’re
vegan? Half of veganism
is preaching about it,
anyway. This way you
get all the fun and kudos
of telling everyone you’re
saving the world, but
maintain the pleasure of
a sneaky steak every now
and then. I know what
you’re thinking though:
what’s the point of a steak
if I can’t Instagram it? Not
to worry, I’ve considered
that too. All you have
to do is write captions
about amazing vegan
mock-meat restaruants
and recipes you’ve found.
Then, if someone asks
you for more details just
tell them you asked Alexa
for a recommendation.
Just like an IRL assistant,
you can blame her for
everything.
Really hope this helped,
let me know how you get
on.
All my love,
Felicity

The only way to be vegan but keep eating delicious
food
This week you are
posthumously elected
onto Union Council.
You’re sentenced to haunt
RSM G.01 for the rest of
eternity.
No rest for the wicked.
This week you walk too
slowly on Exhibition
Road. The Mormons
get you and take you to
their leader. Three days
later you show up in the
library in a white shirt
and no memories of what
happened.
This week you have a
spontaneous breakdown
on the Central line.
Thinking it’s some
performance, people start
clapping.
This week you’re Alice
Gast’s PA. You don’t
mind your job, but you’re
a bit worried you’ll get
caught in the crossfire
when the revolution
happens.
This week your boyfriend
decides to do Movember.
Being single is looking
more attractive by the
day.
This week you spend
9 hours writing up a
last minute consulting
application. You wake up
the next day and realise
you didn’t actually press
submit. Shit.
At least you got an
interview at Starbucks!
This week you are
Deputy President
(Education). You like the
sound of this hologram
idea - this way you won’t
actually have to be in the
same room as the other
Sabb Officers.
This week you’re the
Union receptionist. A
suspicious mysterious
package arrives and you
call Campus Security
for back up. Turns out
to be another prisoner
in Nevada trying to sell
students his erotica.
This week you come
across someone crying in
the corner of the Wolfson
Suite. You’re overcome
with feeling and join
them on the floor in tears.
A society is born.
This week your man
breaks up with you via
e-mail, saying he needs
to focus on applications.
Good thing he uses
the same password for
everything. Who said
the pull-out method’s
ineffective?
This week you walk out
of your department’s
compulsory Shell lecture
in protest. Unfortunately
the lecturer also happens
to be Chair of the Exam
board. Predicted a 2:1? I
think not.
