shocking to artists and the
public. Maggi Hambling’s
Michael Jackson instead
focused on how frozen
he looked during the trail,
juxtaposing it ironically
with his iconic ‘freeze’
move. Looking by Sam
Lipp presents Jackson
with a black and white
palate and an almost
blurry portrait, showing
him as a misty, ghost-like
figure. Michael was at a
low, and the artists right-
fully took note. We can
never know the full truth,
but it is important at least
to understand its effect on
him.

Michael Jackson: On the Wall – the glorification of a
glorified man
An exhibition that encompasses the effect Michael Jackson had on the world.
S
tepping into the
National Portrait
Gallery felt like
visiting a world-fa-
mous show: there were
long queues of people for
tickets, Michael Jackson’s
vibrant music was playing
with dancing audiences,
and visitors spanned all
races, ages, and genders.
Even before entering the
exhibition, there was a
sense of Michael’s impact
on the world – he passed
almost ten years ago, yet
still garnered crowds
larger than most exhibi-
tions I’ve seen on a Friday
night. This is an impact
most stars in history
cannot match.
It cannot be missed that
Michael was, colloquially
speaking, a God and an
icon, as seen by his fans,
but also himself. Sculp-
tures like the incredible
P.Y.T. (standing for, and
in reference to, Jackson’s
track ‘Pretty Young
Thing’) showcasing
balloons tied to his loafers
positioned in his ‘freeze’
move show it all. He
became so synonymous
with a dance move that his
image does not need to be
physically there, instead
replaced with a beautiful
mix of balloons, bringing
a sense of being unreacha-
ble: successful and above
it all. The mere fact that
he had commissioned The
King: Part I by Wiley,
a portrait replacing a
Neapolitan figurehead on
a high horse with himself,
speaks volumes about his
self-image. However, the
fans and contemporary
artists are the ones who
put him there. Portraits
like Archangel Michael:
And No Message Could
Have Been Any Clearer
by David LaChapelle
mimic classical Christian
paintings, where he stands
over the defeated devil,
palms together, with
beautiful, radiant white
wings. Whether the devil
represented world politics
and war, his struggles,
or even just bad music,
his ability to overcome
them was idealized by the
public.
Much of the artwork
also reflected the love
of his fans. From Dawn
Mellor’s teenage drawings
of Michael in 1984, to her
portrait of him in Thriller
in 2007, for example;
they show the lasting
“Michael
Jackson was
a God and an
icon, as seen
by his fans, but
also himself”
commitment the fans have
to him and his music. Off
the Wall, and Thriller
by Susan Smith-Pinelo
featured every single
lyric from each album
respectively, written in
a formulaic and precise
manner, indicating a sense
of how much a fan can
know, and the level of at-
tention to detail they may
pay to the work. King:
Part II by Wiley is a video
consisting of hardcore
fans who volunteered to
sing and dance to Michael
Jackson songs, recorded
and shown in galleries
worldwide. Most sang
with passion (some with
nerves!), while wearing
their Michael Jackson
merchandise, really show-
casing the depth that this
love may reach.
Michael Jackson
tackled race with both
his presence in the media
and his actions. Susan
Smith-Pinelo rightly
points out that the Jackson
Five were the “first
wholesome black family
to enter homes all over the
US”, where most black
icons had had rougher
backgrounds. She created
a looped film, Something,
of a black woman’s
breasts bouncing, with the
words “ghetto” written
on a gold necklace on
her chest, playing Jack-
son’s ‘Workin’ day and
night’ in the background.
Here she indicates the
difficulties in overcom-
ing stereotypes and the
hyper-sexualisation of
black women, using
Michael to do so. Seeing
Michael achieve so much
let the black community
finally see something of
themselves in him, and
as someone successful, as
shown by Self-Portrait at
Seven years old, a piece
that depicts Michael
Jackson, not the artist
Glenn Ligon as one might
expect. Further, Michael’s
‘Thriller’ tackled race in
such an in-depth manner
that is still being analysed
to this day as in The Other
Look, which consisted of
newspaper cuttings of in-
terpretations of the music
video and how it tackles
racism. ‘Thriller’ is one
of the most widely known
songs of all time, hence its
reach really shed light on
the issue of skin colour to
many.
Michael Jackson even
found himself wrapped
in politics. From the very
capitalist endeavour of his
massive Dangerous tour to
Romania, three years after
the end to communism in
that country and depicted
in Last Days of Michael
Jackson in Bucharest by
Dan Mihaltianu, to the
‘Earth Song’ being played
backwards in The Body
Song, indicating that the
message of the song – to
end damage to the Earth
and people – was in part
reversed by him. Michael
has been at the forefront
of such matters and has
been noted by such artists
in their work.
Given all of his success-
es, this is why the People
v. Jackson case was so
role in fashion, art and
film – Michael Jackson
worked hard for his
adoration. However, his
court trial, his addictions
and the circumstance
of his death provide a
grey area to this massive
historic figure. Michael
Jackson left behind a very
complicated legacy that
is hard to unpick, making
him a fascinating enigma
to this day. One thing is
for certain: this exhibition
gave us space to explore
it all again and was fully
worth the visit.
