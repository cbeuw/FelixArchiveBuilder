overwhelmed by an ever-increasing
greenhouse effect. T h e affects o f
the solar cycle do not mean that the
greenhouse effect is not real and so
far • the extra warming from the
anthropogenic greenhouse effect is
small compared to future potential
warming. T h e computer models
have been good at predicting
differences between summer and
winter, between the present and
several thousand years ago, and
between the Earth, Venus and
Mars, which each have different
levels o f natural greenhouse effect.
However the models cannot predict
what will happen in specific areas.
A n average rise o f 3 Vi ° C may mean
a 1 ° C rise in some places but a 5 ° C
rise in other places.
T h e amount o f extra carbon
dioxide in the air is only half o f
what has been produced by human
activities, the other half may have
entered the sea or have been
absorbed through stimulated plant
and microbe growth. However, if
these sinks for carbon dioxide were
to become saturated, the rise in
carbon dioxide concentrations could
be even more dramatic.
T h e e n v i s a g e d s c e n a r i o is
c o m p l i c a t e d by several other
factors. Increasing temperatures
would lead to increased evaporation
of water from oceans and to
increased snow fall at the poles and
a thickening o f the ice. This may
offset sea rises slightly. A n increase
in dust and other atmospheric
pollutants reflects heat away from
the Earth. There is evidence that
north-west Europe did not warm as
rapidly as the rest o f the world
which may be due to extra pollution

ALONG WITH OUR USUAL SERVICES,
WE NOW ALSO COPY IN COLOUR . . .
The ColorEdse 1525 will reproduce clear
and accurate copies from your original
colour picture. It can enlarge and reduce,
keeping a perfect colour balance.
Copies can be made onto A4 and A3
paper, A4 transparencies or your own
paper (up to 110g).
The ColorEdge can aslo copy in single
colour (any of Red, Blue, Green, Cyan,
Magenta and Yellow). However, these are
just some simple controls from the wide
range of functions available. Why not try
out your own idea for a personalised
Christmas Card, for example.

in the atmosphere. There could be
runaway global w a r m i n g — f o r
example, as the planet warms
tundra (effectively frozen swamp)
in northern latitudes, may thaw and
release methane previously locked
up in the tundra thus adding to the
greenhouse effect. There are also
muds on some ocean floors which
contain methane. T h i s stored
methane could be released by
increases i n t e m p e r a t u r e o r
pressure.
W e should not just hope that
global warming will not occur,
because evidence points strongly
towards climatic change over the
next forty years. So what can be
done? A reduction in atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentrations by
man would need about half as much
energy again, thus adding more
carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
A massive programme o f tree
planting over the whole world could
slow global warming, trees absorb
carbon dioxide, by 30 to 50 years
but then what could all this wood
be used for? The Montreal Protocol
to reduce C F C emissions is over an
extended period o f time. If C F C
production was stopped i m m e d -
iately the predictions would be
pushed back about ten years.
In the short-term we need to
become much more energy efficient
(the government has recently begun
an advertising campaign to this end)
eg. use Flourescent bulbs and
reduce car use. A tax should be
l e v i e d o n h i g h c a r b o n fuels
especially coal which produces
more carbon dioxide per unit o f
energy than oil and gas. In the long-
term we must look to alternative
energy sources. T h e amount o f
energy in wind and waves has been
calculated to be so huge that the
planet's energy needs w o u l d
consume only a small fraction o f
wind and wave energy.

become much
more energy
