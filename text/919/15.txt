Point Break Hot Shots!
Keanu Reeves is fast becoming hot
property in Hollywood. T h e role he
plays in Point Break is quite a
quantum leap for h i m , being
renowned for taking roles where
being stupid was factor number one
(i.e. Bill & Ted's Excellent
Adventure, Parenthood); he plays,
with a great deal o f authenticity I
might add, an F B I agent on the trail
of the 'Ex-Presidents'—a bunch o f
masked bank robbers, who remain
perfectly uncaught after two years
(and about seventy banks). It was
deduced that these guys (sorry
'dudes') were surfers. This is where
Patrick Swayze comes i n ; a surfer
by profession and complete nutter
the rest o f the time, constantly in
search o f the ultimate ride, risking
all for the biggest high! In fact, as
the film progresses it becomes
evident that Keanu Reeves also is
losing his marbles. T h e two
compete for the most daring (or
should that be stupid—o.k. let's see
who pulls their parachute ripcord
closest to the ground then!!).
Patrick Swayze plays a more
minor role than the trailers and hype
would have y o u believe; it's Keanu
that really steals the show, and it's
his character you see developing, so
by the end y o u can't help but feel
rather empty about Patrick's role
(unlike his role in blockbusters such
as Ghost or Dirty Dancing). O n e
just doesn't get the chance to trust
h i m , w h i c h is just as w e l l
because...(now y o u must prepare
yourself for this, take a seat, stick
a hanky in your gob) Patrick
Swayze is a bad guy!!! Noooooo!
I hear y o u cry, I ' m sorry, but it's
true.
I personally think the film is
great; it does have some curious
wriggles but then nothing's perfect
is it? Included is some absolutely
b r e a t h - t a k i n g p h o t o g r a p h y ,
(honestly, it really is something
quite special), some hot and steamy
romance, plenty o f action; car
chases, running down the high
street with your piece out (that's a
gun) M e l Gibson style, morals,
friendship, a meandering plot, the
list goes on. It will doubtlessly be
compared to films like Lethal
Weapon and Beverly Hill Cop, but
it really is a much fresher approach
to the genre, and a credit to both
actors.
Poo.
Hot Shots! (I hate films with
exclamation marks in their name)
is the latest produce from the Police
Squad and The Naked Gun stables.
L i k e most things out o f stables, it
also generates a lot o f shit and has
a glossy chestnut coat.
As usual, this one is a spoof
(that's a crap word, isn't it?) o f
famous flicks from years past; this
time the target is Top Gun and its
ilk o f dinosaur macho bollocks
movies. A n d a worthy target it is
too, as Barry N o r m a n would say.
Charlie Sheen plays a flyboy,
Topper Harley, with a dark secret;
thrown out o f his squadron once,
he's re-recruited for a deadly
mission, coded 'Sleepy Weasel'.
Once back, he has to contend with
jealous rivals, a leggy psychiatrist
and a brace o f chihuahua, as well
as circumventing the visual gags
that pop out o f every crevice. Said
gags a r e pretty g o o d , b u t
u n f o r t u n a t e l y t h e y ' r e so
effervescent I don't remember any
of them. I guess that says something
about the film. O h yeah., the guy
with the fish in his glasses, the
military armpatch that say 'Perrier'
and hundreds of others. N o , really,
there are. Just because I can't recall
them doesn't mean you won't enjoy
them. Honest. Thankfully the
writers appear to have left
adolescence now and there isn't the
traditional strip joint sequence,
although there are more pratfalls
than anyone could really want. In
fact, the main weak point o f this
film is that while the background
jokes are still fresh, the humour o f
the script itself is growing more
tired with every release this team
do.
G o see this film for mindless
enjoyment; it'll do y o u good. T h e
T o k e n A m e r i c a n doesn't get the
point o f this film. But that's why
she's A m e r i c a n .

Valmont
Valmont is M i l o s F o r m a n ' s first
film since Amadeus in 1984. It is
an adaption o f the book Les
Liaisons Dangereuses and is the
second film to be based o n this
novel by Choderlos de Laclos. T h e
previous production, Dangerous
Liaisons, directed b y Stephen
Frears was adapted from the play
by Chris Hampton rather than the
novel itself, which accounts for the
differences in the story. Frears' film
starred Glenn Close as the scheming
Marquise de Merteuil and John
M a l k o v i c h as Valmont.
Miles Forman began the shooting
of his film before Frears but was
unable to compete with the larger
production which was completed
earlier. In order to avoid a clash
between the two, it was decided to
delay the release o f this film until
now.
T h e story revolves around two
18th Century aristocrats Merteuil
and Valmont (played by Annette
Bening and C o l i n Frith). T h e y are
both accomplished in the art o f
seduction and will stop at nothing
to achieve what they desire.
Merteuil wishes Valmont to aid her
in revenge by seducing the 15-year-
old virgin Cecile who is betrothed
to her ex-lover. Valmont however
is intent on a conquest o f his o w n ,
over the virtuous and beautiful
M a d e de Tourvel (played by M e g
Tilly).
With names such as Glenn Close
a n d J o h n M a L k o v i c h as
predecessors, Annette Bening and
C o l i n Firth have a lot to compete
with in the inevitable comparisons
between the two films.
Bening is fortunate in that the
character o f Merteuil in this film is
deeper. She is more involved with
Cecile as a seemingly caring
companion whilst at the same time
is plotting to ruin her.
Cecile also has a larger and more
likeable role in this film. She
appears as a younger and more
innocent victim.
T h e character o f Valmont is the
biggest difference between the two
p r o d u c t i o n s . H e is a m o r e
sympathetic figure here with some
romantic qualities as opposed to the
cold calculating methods used by
Malkovitch's Valmont.
Overall, this production is a more
compelling version than Dangerous
Liaisons as the relationship between
Merteuil and Valmont is more
tangible. B e n i n g in particular
performs exceptionally well.
