Personal V i e w
Only a
Sir,
I read last week's Felix with great
interest, particularly the news and
comment pertaining to the subject
of mascotry. I fully respect your
views, and those of M s Creissen,
and for the record, I should like to
state that I agree strongly with the
concept that Union policy should be
made by present and not past,
students. However, the subject is
raising such emotive debate; I am
offering here my own views on the
subject in the hope that they will be
of some assistance to those who
know little about it.
F o r many at IC the mention of
mascotry conjures up an image of
car chases through London, drilling
through locks, overpowering the
protectors of mascots and generally
behaving like one of the cast of The
Italian Job. In my opinion, this
point of view is held by small-
minded individuals who have no
business c a l l i n g t h e m s e l v e s
Mascoteers. Mascotry is not about
any of these things, nor has it ever
been.
Mascotry is, above all else, a
gentlemen's game. (I am not being
sexist; W o m e n have as much right
to participate as men. It is just that
I am unable to find an egalitarian
e x p r e s s i o n for ' g e n t l e m a n l y
conduct', please bear with me.) It
is an intellectual game, requiring
thorough reconnaisance, meticulous
planning and skilled execution. T o
m y c e r t a i n k n o w l e d g e , all
successful mascotry attempts at IC
over the last five years have
involved finding the 'safe house' or
h i d i n g place by low p r o f i l e
intelligence gathering, taking
advantage of a lapse on the part of
the defenders, and two or three
people removing the mascot while
it was unattended. None have been
taken as the result of a car chase,
or the abuse of the so-called
'overwhelming numbers' rule.
T h e o r i g i n o f the f r a n k l y
irresponsible use of vehicles is a
result of people losing sight of
exactly what they were trying to
achieve. Originally the idea was to
locate the other side's safe house or
hiding place, and this was achieved
in many ways. Inconspicuous
observers on street corners would
follow at a discreet distance using
an unknown car or motorcycle, or
even a black cab. T h e defenders
would in turn attempt to spot their
erstwhile followers and lose them,
sometimes using a 'chase car' of
their own to assist in this process,
and so the car wars began. In actual
fact, the v i e w o f most true
mascoteers is that the battle is over
as soon as the defending crew spots
the follower because, like the
hunted mother fox which runs the
opposite direction to her burrow to
protect her young, even a simpleton
would not return to a safe house
with a tail.
The true mascoteer views the 'car
chaser' the same way as a skilled
angler views those who fish by
d y n a m i t i n g l a k e s . T h e o n l y
difference is that dynamite gets
results. It does not take an
intellectual collossus to realise that
f o l l o w i n g i n c h e s b e h i n d the
defending vehicle in a well known
car, wearing C C U regalia and
waving a large illegal radio will
achieve very little. The accident that
occured during the first month of'
term had been waiting to happen
since the very first time a driver was
too stupid or proud to give up when
he had been spotted.
H o w can we play this game in a
gentlemanly fashion? Consider the
example of the two R C S men who
located the cupboard inside Mines
where Davy was kept. They did this
by hiding in broom cupboards after
each U G M , comparing notes on
which corridors the procession
passed and how long it was before
the bearers reappeared, slowly
building up a picture over a year
until the cupboard was located. This
is real mascotry, of a sort practised
as recently as last academic year
against other L o n d o n colleges,
strangely enough by the same
people who organise the i n t e r - C C U
car chases. So what makes in-house
mascotry such a dirty business?
Basically the stakes are too high.
Theta, the R C S mascot, is maybe
the biggest p r o b l e m . H a v i n g
remained inviolate for over fifteen
years (i.e. not having been stolen),
those protecting her will do almost
anything to keep her. However, for
the same reason, those with an eye
to her capture will go to equal
lengths. I do not intend to debate the
question of who got dirty first, or
who plays dirtiest; that sort of
squabble is meaningless and will not
help solve the problem. W e have to
admit that we have been playing the
game the wrong way and decide
what to do about it.
I opened by talking about
gentlemanly conduct, and perhaps
it is now appropriate to explain what
I mean. E v e n as a loyal supporter
of the R C S , and an ex-mascoteer,
I would like to see Theta stolen.
However, I would like it to be the
result of a monumentally clever
scheme, involving only a handful of
people using guile, deception and
good humour, the kind of thing that
makes you say ' Y o u ' v e got to hand
it to t h e m . . . ' , and not as a result of
an angry mob breaking up a U G M
d e m a n d i n g that they had
' o v e r w h e l m i n g n u m b e r s ' , and
would we kindly hand the mascot
over or they would beat us to a
pulp. D o n ' t laugh; it happened
when I was at college.
A s an aside, during the incident
in question, the attacking side
probably did have the required three
to one ratio which constituted
overwhelming numbers in the
mascotry rules of the day, but were
defeated by g u i l e . U n f a i r ?
A c c o r d i n g to the letter of the law,
maybe; but what about the spirit of
the law? In fact, the rules weren't
written to encourage a 'mob rule'
approach to mascotry, but to
prevent it. T h e rule was written
after the capture of a mascot some
years previously. T h e captors had
found the safe house and had been
observing it, but as it never
appeared to be empty, their attempt
seemed doomed. They therefore
waited until only two people were
home, concealed around twenty of
their supporters in and around the
front garden and then two people
knocked on the front door. W h e n
it was answered, the twenty
revealed themselves and the caller
announced that they knew the
mascot was in the house. They did
not storm the front door (these were
the days of gentlemanly conduct,
remember), but pointed out that
they could do so. T h e occupants,
also being gentlemen, did not
attempt to slam the door, but gave
the attackers credit for locating the
house and handed over the mascot.
T h e rule was subsequently written
to point out that you only needed
three to one in that situation. I hope
the difference between the situations
is clear.
Enough of yesterday. What about
today? W e have established that the
stakes are too high, and I believe
that we have shown that we are no
longer capable of c o n d u c t i n g
ourselves in a fair and and proper
manner. T h e new rules go some
way to opposing this. They have the
worthy objectives of making the
mascots come out more, and
removing the stigma of having a
mascot stolen by making the
mascots easier to steal, but I am
unconvinced that they will remove
all the undesirable elements of
mascotry in its present state. A s for
the ex-students that stole Theta, I
have not spoken to them, but they
are known to me personally. It is
my belief that they did not take her
because of a small-minded attitude
that she should not leave the R C S ,
but to prevent further problems
occuring during Rag Week. That
may sound pompous, but m y
reasons are this; firstly, as they are
quoted in your report, Theta is in
fact extremely delicate and complex
and has in the past been damaged
by rough handling. Secondly, the
people who took the mascot and the
students it was taken from know and
respect each other. If, as your
report implies, they almost came to
blows, what would have been the
effect of bringing Theta to an event
like the beer festival, in front of
several hundred drunken students of
different C C U s , where there would
be no love lost?
I have criticised the new rules, so
now let me be constructive. There
are positive aspects to mascotry, not
least of which is that it can raise a
lot of money for Rag. It also
provides a sense of identity for the
C C U s , when applied correctly.
Even so, we have shown that we are
not able to play within IC, so
perhaps a ban on i n t e r - C C U
m a s c o t r y w o u l d m a k e those
involved cast their nets further, to
other colleges where they seem to
be able to behave honourably.
Personally, I would like to see
mascotry return to being an
intellectual contest between the
C C U s (after all, IC is supposed to
be a centre of academic excellence).
The rules I would propose are the
following:
1. Motor Vehicles may only be used
to transport mascots. Obviously
unenforceable for the unseen
follower, but heavy penalties for
C C U s and individual students
would stop the 'car wars' cold.
2. A mascot may only be stolen if
it does not have its declared bearer
or bearers for that year in
attendance. If one or both are absent
