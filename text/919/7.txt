History of the Space Shuttle
A costly 'white elephant' or a major
breakthrough for space flight? Early
in 1972, the N i x o n administration
announced that the United States
was i n i t i a t i n g a new space
programme that would 'Take the
a s t r o n o m i c a l costs out o f
a s t r o n a u t i c s ' a n d w o u l d
revolutionise space travel by
making it routine, 'turning the space
frontier of the 1970s into familiar
territory.'
The Space Shuttle has had as
many defenders as it has detractors.
At 6.30pm, Tuesday 3rd December
in Electrical Engineering R o o m
408, Reg Turnhill will be giving a
talk on the history of the Space
Shuttle. This talk will look at the
reasons behind the Space Shuttle's
d e v e l o p m e n t a n d its p a t c h y
operational history; reasons for the
1986 Challenger disaster and the
solutions implemented before the
resumption of flight operations in
1988; and what the future may hold
for the ten year old space shuttle
fleet, which has recently notched up
its 44th flight.
M a n y o f you will remember Reg
Turnhill from the early days o f the
Space Shuttle programme as the
B B C Children's T V 'Newsround'
space reporter.

The badminton team has certainly
had a smashing start this season.
With two men's teams and one
ladies' team, we managed to come
through the first round o f the U A U
in a truly magnificent fashion. So
far, the mens' 2nd team and the
ladies team are unbeaten; while the
mens' 1st team has lost only one
match.
Last weekend, we participated in
the U A U individuals tournament in
Nottingham University. O u r team
consisted o f six men (R Langford,
J L i m , R Jumar, C L T a n , S
Trussel, M Francis) and six ladies
Windsurfing
( W T a n , B Spence, W Yates, E
Fok, U Boltze, C Roberts). O u r
best result was in the ladies singles
where Wendy T a n got through to
the quarter finals before she was
narrowly beaten. W i t h 40 other
universities participating, the event
proved to be most enjoyable. W e
not only experienced the sheer
competitiveness of the game, but a
tremendous amount o f team spirit
as we supported and cheered for
each other.
A s the season carries on, we have
high hopes to go much further.
Despite variable winds and heavy
rain, the windsurfing club managed
to have a great time in Wales.
Those o f us brave enough to put on
a wetsuit and venture into the sea
spent Saturday surfing (with Julia
even venturing to her knees).
The compulsory visit to a Welsh
disco in the evening was superb, if
only for the chance to down a beer
for £1.20 a pint and bop away to
Status Q u o (?!).
In contrast to Saturday, Sunday
was very windy. Unfortunately, no
one woke up much before lunch
time, resulting in a mad rush to the
sheltered beach. T h i s actually
consisted o f towering waves, so it
was left for Phil, the cool hot shot,
to go out and do battle. This he d i d
sensationally, barely spending any
time on the water and getting
spectacular air time, whilst Andrew
got eaten horribly by a wave and
resurfaced with a shredded rig.
A n y w a y , i f cheap beer and the
chance to wear some mean rubber
appeals to you, then surf on over to
the Southside U p p e r L o u n g e ,
12.30pm on Tuesday for more
details.
