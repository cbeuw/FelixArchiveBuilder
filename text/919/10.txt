New Zealand is a beautiful country
nestling in the South Pacific. It is
about the same size as the U K , has
three million people and seventy
million sheep. It consists o f three
main islands; the North Island,
c o n t a i n i n g A u c k l a n d a n d
Wellington, the South Island with
Christchurch and Dunedin, and
Stewart Island (population 400) at
the far south. T h e secret o f the
country's beauty is its geology.
Stewart Island that had a boiler on
the fire for hot running water!
I spent three years (1988-91)
studying for a research degree at
Massey University in Palmerston
North and was lucky enough to do
many o f N e w Zealand's major
tracks. Doubtless many people will
have heard of Fiordlands' famous
M i l f o r d Track, there are however
several other walks that are just as
scenic and far more challenging.
to the mighty Wanganui River in the
centre of the park. Great views of
the river. Y o u must arrange to be
picked up by jet boat at the river as
there is no vehicle access.
A b e l Tasman National Park:
H o m e of the A b e l Tasman coastal
track. Justifiably famous throughout
the hiking world for its beautiful,
rainforest lined, deserted sandy
beaches with abundant sea food
(oysters, mussels, abalone etc).

New Zealand lies at the meeting of
two continental plates. T h i s has
created a spine o f mountains and
volcanoes (with the associated hot
springs, geysers and earthquakes)
running down the centre o f the
North and South Islands. This
makes for magnificent tramping
(hiking for poms). N e w Zealand is
justifiably proud of its parks. T h e
tracks are seldom crowded (I saw
no one else for five days on the
Heaphy Track), well maintained,
and contain a series o f huts at
approximately five hourly intervals.
F o r a minimal fee (£1.50 - £2.50)
placed in a box in the hut, you can
use facilities that range from a basic
hut with bunks, fresh water tanks
and an open fire with chopped wood
or coal, to some with gas rings and
gas fires. I even found one on
Tongariro National Park: A five
day track a r o u n d the triple
volcanoes -of Ruapehu, Ngaruhoe
and Tongariro. Highlights include
hot springs near one of the huts and
'lunar-like' terrain.
Urewera National Park: A four
day walk around the beautiful Lake
Waikaramoana. Highlights include
lush rainforest and interesting
M a o r i history.
Mount Egmont National Park: A
five day round-the-mountain walk.
T h e perfect cone o f the Egmont
V o l c a n o dominates the entire
Taranaki Peninsula. Great views
from the top.
Wanganui National Park: T h e
last r e m a i n i n g area o f true
wilderness in the North Island. T h e
Matemateaonga Track (four days)
stretches from Taranaki in the West
This area gets some of the best
weather in the country. A must.
North West Nelson State Forest
Park: Contains the Heaphy and
Wangapeka Tracks, both seven day
walks. T h e Heaphy travels from
near Nelson to the West Coast
through beech forests, tussock
uplands and palm tree fringed
beaches. A l o n g with the A b e l
Tasman and the Milford, one of the
most popular walks in the country.
T h e Wangapeka lies south o f the
Heaphy and is considerably more
challenging, being over much
rougher terrain and three mountain
saddles. Nelson Lakes National
Park: Contains three Travers-
Sabine Tracks linking the parks
twin lakes of Rotoiti and Fotoroa
via the spectacular Travers Saddle.

good weather and fine views.
Fiordland National Park is probably
the largest national park in the
southern hemisphere and has been
declared a W o r l d Heritage Area. It
is a wilderness region o f unbroken
mountains cut by deep fiords. It has
very little vehicle access. It's most
famous track, thought by many to
be the the 'finest walk in the world'
is the M i l f o r d Track, a four day
walk from the head of Lake T e
ith
A n a u to M i l f o r d S o u n d v i a
Mackinnon Pass. O n a clear day the
view from the pass is spectacular.
Unfortunately on the day I got there
there was a pea-souper! T h e
Milford Track is extremely popular
and y o u must book ahead to claim
one o f the fourty places per day
allowed on the track. However I
much preferred the ten day D u s k y
Sound Track, an extremely isolated
journey in the southern end o f the
park, much less well-known than
the M i l f o r d and far more o f a
challenge. Access is across a
mountain lake by small fishing boat
that leaves once a week.
Tracks in the M o u n t Aspiring
N a t i o n a l P a r k i n c l u d e the
Routeburn, Greenstone/Caples and
Rees/Dart o f which the Routeburn
is by far the most popular.

Finally Stewart Island. This was
my favourite walk, an 11 day trip
around the northern half o f the
island. Stewart Island has just one
samll settlement (basically a landing
point for the ferry), the rest o f the
island is a roadless wilderness with
magnificent birdlife (kiwis, parrots
etc), penguins and seals. O n this
walk y o u truly feel that you are on
the edge o f the world, the next stop
is Antarctica.
