One million children die each
year as a consequence of being
bottle fed rather than breast fed.
T h e United Nation's W o r l d Health
Organisation ( W H O ) notes three
main reasons for these deaths -
• M e d i c a l l y s p e a k i n g breast
feeding is superior to bottle feeding
because although the protein content
is similar, mothers' milk has the
added advantage of being specially
tailored for the child and providing
immunity to various diseases.
• The water used to mix with the
powdered milk is often dirty. In a
community without clean drinking
water a bottle fed baby is 25 times
more likely to die of diarrhoea.
• The high cost of powdered milk
means that children are not fed
e n o u g h and this leads to
malnutrition.
So why do mothers bottle feed if
breast milk is free, safe and protects
against infection, and bottle feeding
is k n o w n to be d a n g e r o u s ,
unsuitable and expensive? T h e
answer is simple - it is in the
interests o f the baby m i l k
manufacturers. T h e world baby
milk market is worth around £6
billion and half of this comes from
the T h i r d W o r l d .
A s a consequence the large milk
manufacturers aggressively market
in the Third World. Obviously there
is nothing wrong with a company
trying to sell its product, but their
marketing techniques are highly
unethical. T h e companies provide
free milk to maternity hospitals and
clinics and employ staff to educate
mothers in how to bottle feed.
Normally each mother is given a
free sample of the milk when she
leaves the hospital. Thus mothers
are given the impression that the
health service is recommending
bottle feeding rather than breast
feeding. T h i s technique is so
effective that one industry manual
states, 'when considering that for
every 100 infants discharged on a
particular formula brand, 93 infants
r e m a i n o n that b r a n d , the
importance of hospital selling
becomes obvious.'
H e a l t h w o r k e r s often feel
indebted to the milk companies who
provide them with other perks, and
since most of them lack any formal
medical education. They believe the
glossy health brochures extolling
the virtues of bottle feeding that the
companies produce.
V e r y few countries are powerful
enough to stop the activities of the
multi-national milk companies,
especially since many of these
countries rely upon the companies
for their foreign exports. Costa Rica
is one of the few countries who
enforce a strong anti-milk company
code, here all babies are breast fed
(or g i v e n l o c a l l y p r o d u c e d
substitutes), and they now have the
lowest infant death rate in Latin
A m e r i c a .
T h e W H O and the U n i t e d
Nations Childrens Fund ( U N I C E F )
have produced a code of ethics for
the marketing of baby milk in the
T h i r d W o r l d w h i c h all the
companies have signed and agreed
to follow. This code bans the direct
advertising of baby milk, and bans
the supply of free milk to hospitals.
However, these rules are constantly
contravened either directly or
manufacturer, it is the largest with
5 0 % of the market. T h e only way
to affect a large corporation is to
damage its public image or its
profits. B M A C has persuaded a
large number o f people and
organisations to boycott Nestle
products or to protest to Nestle. IC
Third World First is aiming to make
people aware of the situation and to
encourage staff, students and the
college as a whole to abandon
Nestle products, the U n i o n has
a l r e a d y passed a m o t i o n
nd Honey
indirectly. T o side-step the rules on
hospital supplies the companies now
charge a nominal amount and often
never enforce payment.
P r o b a b l y one o f the most
disgusting aspects of the milk
c o m p a n y m a r k e t i n g is the
production o f free literature for the
health s e r v i c e w h i c h g i v e
information on breast feeding. T h e
information in these leaflets is often
misleading so that breast feeding
will be uncomfortable for the
mothers thus causing them to swap
to bottle feeding.
In an attempt to combat the
actions of the milk companies a
group called Baby M i l k Action
Coalition ( B M A C ) is conducting a
boycott of Nestle products. I C
Third World First have adopted this
boycott as one of its campaigns for
this year. T h e aim of the boycott is
not to prevent the use o f powdered
milk, in some cases it may be
necessary, or mothers may not wish
to breast feed and they should be
given the right to feed their babies
how they wish. However what we
are concerned about is the unethical
marketing of baby milk in countries
where it is not appropriate. T h e aim
of B M A C is to put pressure on
Nestle to conform to the W H O
rules. Nestle has been targetted
because, although it is not the only
condemning Nestle's actions and
stock very few of their products.
W e are aiming to involve the other
' L o n d o n colleges in this campaign,
and shall be presenting the same
motion at U L U (University of
London) in December.
A s individuals you can stop
drinking Nescafe, there are lots of
alternatives (supermarkets' own
brands tend to be just as good and
much cheaper). If you wish to write
to Nestle we will be able to give you
information and ideas for a letter.
Sceptics may argue that such
campaigns are ineffective, and it is
true that there has been action
against Nestle for over ten years,
however the action is now quite
widespread and it must be starting
to hurt since Nestle produce counter
publicity to defend their case.
I C T h i r d W o r l d First a i m to
highlight T h i r d W o r l d issues, and
our other campaign this year is on
the debt crisis. W e have speaker
meetings each T h u r s d a y (see
posters) and general meetings each
Friday lunchtime in Southside
Upper Lounge. If you have any
questions or comments on what we
do, then either come along to a
meeting, write to us via the U n i o n
pigeonholes or write a letter to
Felix.
