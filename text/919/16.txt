Howson Art Duel
Peter Howson, a shy and awkward
man, is perhaps a less than likely
candidate deserving adulation from
the fashionable world o f East
London's art community, but for
the next four weeks he is their
champion.
Born in L o n d o n but raised, from
the age o f three, i n Glasgow,
H o w s o n takes much o f his subject
matter from the tough images he
saw around him in the east end o f
his adopted city. Howson's current
show entitled Blind Leading the
Blind has all the quintessential
features o f his earlier work. Brutal
characters depicting scenes o f
deprivation and despair through
images o f religion, anarchy and
conflict are brought to life by the
artist's bold use of light, shade and
line. M a n y o f the exhibits are
sketches and single portraits later
d e v e l o p e d i n full canvasses.
C l e v e r as these are, they only
emphasise Howson's true talent
w h i c h is his w o r k o n large
.canvases. Chaotic scenes at an
O r a n g e W a l k are masterfully
observed with fine details, such as
sattelite dish on the side o f a
dilapidated tenement, hinting at
their creator's wit. H i s crowd
scenes are inspired and their
c o m p l e x i t y breathtaking. T h e
artist's ability is evident and his
skills o f observation superb but at
thirty-three he is a relatively young
man to have found his style and be
sticking to it. H i s figurative
approach has changed very little
through the years with only a
continual refinement taking place.
The thuggish ugliness of his figures
is perhaps a little more extreme
these days but his winning formula
remains. Undoubtedly Howson's
w o r k is appealing despite its
burlesque cruel face but having now
broken through into mainstream
L o n d o n exhibiting it will be
interesting to see if he will challenge
us with new styles and fresh ideas
in the years to come.
Blind Leading the Blind is
showing at Flowers East, 199
Richmond Road, Hackney from
10th November until 8th December
1991. Admission is free.
Duel is the first Annual o f the
newest Batman series Batman:
Legends of the Dark Knight which
followed on the same vein as Return
of the Dark Knight with a blacker
more sinister Batman.
Duel finds Batman returning to
the monastery where he received his
Z e n training, carrying a large bag.
After talking to his old master
(shades o f Karate Kid) he leaves
through a door revealed to him by
the master. Batman then proceeds
through various scenarios, the
object of which seems the removal
o f the bag from his possession.
Possession of the bag or burden is
the central subject o f the book, as
his master says maintenance o f
possession is most important.
Batman risks life and limb to
continue to carry the bag, indeed his
zeal for the task is akin to that
preached by Ibsen's Brand, despite
the disadvantage retaining the bag
incurs.
Each scenario is penciled and
inked by different artists. Rather
than disrupting the continuity this
technique highlights the radically
different nature o f each scenario.
Excellent art is provided b y Joe
Quezada, and Steve Oliff's superb
colouring throughout the comic is
o f the highest s t a n d a r d
complementing and lifting all the
artists' work.
A n insight into the Batman
character with a very satisfying
ending. Worth a read.
Duel is a 64 page comic costing
£2.25.

Editorial Note:
Ibsen is a famous dead
Scandinavian playwright and
Tefal-head extreme. W e
congratulate L.B. on using him in
