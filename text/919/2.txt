Cheering Weakly Waste of Paper
Firstly, thanks to Paul for doing me
the honour of being a partner in
crime last Saturday, it was great
fun. I hope everyone enjoyed Rag
Week, it was the best I've ever
experienced at College.
Sickly bit over, what's coming
up? Well, with only two weeks left,
I suppose Christmas tests will be
somewhere on the list. So why not
sit back, relax, forget tests and have
some fun? Pele are playing in the
U n i o n tonight along with the usual
disco and late bar.
For an international flavour after
this week's O S C stall in the J C R
there's a Kensington International
Society D i s c o i n the L o u n g e
tomorrow night. This includes a
midnight bar extension.
After that there's only one day of
November left, so I recommend
you watch the football on I T V (as
the bar's shut when that's on). A n d
into December we go. O n M o n d a y
night there's a live band in the
Lounge and all week there's a
Newcastle Brown and Theakstons'
bottle beer promotion (so y o u can
practice for Christmas).
Cocktails are available from the
Red Zone on Thursday and o f
course the Ents kiddies have their
usual gigs on Wednesday and
Friday.

Friday Night is Ents Night again
after a couple o f weeks off. T o p
Ents Journalist Marjorie Strobes
takes up the story...
Pele—the v e r y name is
synonymous with the man whose
mind-boggling ball control formed
the basis of the great Brazilian
forward lines o f the 50's, 60's and
70's, a poor boy from the ghetto
w h o t h r i l l e d c r o w d s a n d
mesmerised defences the world
over. But recently the world's
greatest sporting genius has hung up
his boots and turned his attentions
to more urgent matters.
'I was sick and tired of being
thought of as a one-dimensional
character' said Pele, yesterday.
'Baffling goalies with amazing
banana k i c k s ' f r o m dead-ball
situations is all very well and good,
but I always believed that producing
catchy, danceable pop music with
a folky feel, along the lines of bands
like the Wonder Stuff, was where
my true talents l a y . '
Pele is obviously very pleased
with his recent foray into the hurly-
burly world o f pop. 'I think being
awarded 'single o f the week' on
Simon M a y o ' s Radio 1 Breakfast
Show with the catchy Raid the
Palace, is a personal achievement
to rank alongside any of my three
euphoric World Cup victories', said
the man who has been called 'the
greatest footballer the world has
ever seen'. 'I doubt if the likes o f
Diego Maradonna or Paolo Rossi
would even get a look in on B B C
Local Radio!', he added, with a wry
s m i l e . (This is a load of
rubbish—Ed.)
Pele play the U n i o n Lounge
tonight, with support from Great
Northern Electrics. T i c k e t s
(available from the U n i o n Office)
are £2.50 in advance, or £3 on the
door, £1.50 to Ents cardholders.
Doors open 9pm and there's a late
bar until l a m and disco til 2.
