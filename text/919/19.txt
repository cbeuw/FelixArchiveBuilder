Steve Farrant, I C U H o n o r a r y
Secretary (Events), was cautioned
by the police during the Nude
K a m i k a z e Parachute j u m p on
Saturday.
M r Farrant said that he and Paul
Thomas were 'strolling casually',
three-legged and naked, down
Prince Consort Road when they
were stopped by Diplomatic Police.
The Police threatened to arrest
them and charge them with
'offending public decency'. T h e
Police added that running naked
t h r o u g h central L o n d o n was
irresponsible and that they should
know better as students. T h e
students could have been held in
Police cells for the rest of the day.
Messrs Farrant and Thomas were
then driven about 100 metres to Beit
A r c h where they were told to get
dressed.
This is the first time Police have
been involved with the Nude
Kamakaze Parachute Jump, an
event held on behalf of I C U Rag for
the past three years. M a r c Ellis,
R a g C h a i r m a n , said that the
incident 'was a little unfair... to get
a lift part of the way'.

NatWest
T h e NatWest s u b - b r a n c h in the
Sherfield building will be closed
during the Christmas vacation in
order to redesign the layout of its
customer service area.
The refurbisment will take place
between 13th December and 6th
January. Customers of the bank are
advised to use the branch near the
South Kensington tube station
during this period. T h e cash
machine will remain in operation
over Christmas.
M r George Jamieson, manager of
the Imperial College sub-branch,
said that 'a lot of money was being
spent' and the result could be a
' m u c h i m p r o v e d b a n k i n g
environment'. He added that the
redesign would give a lot more
space to customers.
A n y specific problems about the
t e m p o r a r y closure should be
addressed to M r Jamieson at the
College branch.
A I D S awareness week is running

Professor Roy Anderson of IC's
Biology Department appeared on
Television with Ruby W a x on
Monday as part of a series of
programmes over the week.
Zoe' H e l l i n g e r , I C U n i o n
President, said she 'didn't know
about it', but was planning an
' a w a r e n e s s d a y ' next y e a r .
Professor Anderson said that it
would be helpful for student Unions
to transmit information about A I D S
to students.

Drug Trial Names
Disciplinary procedures have been
started against a number of Imperial
students by the administration. This
follows the recent drugs incident at
Bernard Sunley House, a College-
owned hall of residence in E v e l y n
Gardens.
O n Thursday 21 November, the
residence tribunal c o m m i t t e e
decided that the incident was far too
serious for them to deal with and so
has been passed on to a College
tribunal. Zoe Hellinger, IC U n i o n
President, said that the Police are
watching the procedures very
closely and added U n i o n may take
up their own inquiry depending on
the result. She added that the janitor
of the Hall is still awaiting a staff
disciplinary hearing.
Bottles of spirits were stolen from
the cocktail stall at the Guilds
carnival during rag week. The items
taken total around £50 and included
full bottles of gin and brandy. T h e
organiser of the stall, Steve Donely,
said that the thief is known to them
and they would appreciate it if he
could either return the bottles to the
Guilds office or repay the money
lost by Rag.
Beccy Land, Rag Secretary, said
that the Rag charities are a far more
worthy cause than a selfish student,
and the return of the goods would
be greatly appreciated. M r Donely
said that if the goods or money are
not delivered by next Thursday the
culprit may find his name printed
on the front page of Felix.
The students who damaged a Union
sign during the Mines Dirty Diso on
M o n d a y 18 November are to pay
for its replacement. T h e students,
who came from St. M a r y ' s Hospital
Medical School, agreed to pay after
being threatened with disciplinary
proceedings.
T h e sign will cost nearly £600 to
replace and as the U n i o n does not
feel that it can charge the two
students involved the full amount,
it is looking for a cheaper sign. Zoe
Hellinger, IC U n i o n Pesident, said
that this was to ensure that IC
students will not lose out because
of mindless vandalism.
The disciplinary committee can
suspend students from all U n i o n
activities, but has decided to take no
further action in this case.
