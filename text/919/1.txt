Students Strike Back
Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n w i l l
encourage students not to cross
picket lines during next week's
College-wide strike. Yesterday's
Extraordinary General Meeting
( E G M ) saw a motion passed
supporting the action by College
staff upset by proposals to make all
College messengers and security
staff redundant.
T h e strike will take place o n
W e d n e s d a y 4th D e c e m b e r to
coincide with a meeting o f the
Governing Body which controls the
running of the College. Every trade
union in College will take part in
the a c t i o n , except the A U T
( A s s o c i a t i o n o f U n i v e r s i t y
Teachers) and N A L G O (National
Association o f L o c a l Government
Officers). T h e A U T has instructed
its members not to cross picket lines
and N A L G O is holding a ballot
today which is expected to support
the dispute.
Steve N e w b o l d , the College
Management Negotiater, criticised
the Students U n i o n motion saying
that parts o f it were 'frankly
incorrect'. M r N e w b o l d continued
by saying that there were to be two
more meetings between the trade
unions and College management
before any decision was made. H e
repeated that any 'cost cutting
alternative' would be considered.
The Guardian covered the dispute
after recieving a letter f r o m
Professor Sayers, the Dean of City
and G u i l d s C o l l e g e , w h i c h
contained serious criticisms o f the
proposed redundancies. Professor
Sayers was contacted by Felix, but
did not wish to comment further.
He said that the matter was now an
issue for staff and trade unions. M r
Steve Newbold commented that the
letter had created negative publicity
for College and the individuals
concerned.
Other criticism has come from
m e m b e r s o f the C o m p u t i n g
Department. In reply to a letter they
sent to the Rector, he will be
meeting a representation from the
Department on Monday. Members
of the committee were not willing
to comment further.
Professor Shaw, Chairman of the
Academic Staff Assembly, has also
written to the Rector and is still
awaiting a reply. His letter claims
'a profound loss o f confidence in
College Management' among staff
members. H e told Felix that his
letter h a d e n c o u n t e r e d n o
disagreement among staff who had
seen it.
The Rector, S i r Eric A s h , said
that management of the College had
changed recently and that the
communication o f Management
proposals had been 'less than
perfect.' He was not surprised that
staff were concerned about the
proposals, but said in response to
the I C U motion (see story on E G M )
that it was 'rather bizarre' that
students felt they could achieve
anything by not going to lectures.
H e confirmed that no concrete
alternatives had come from the
trade unions, but he 'sincerely
hoped they would.'
Doors Down and Out Loans
A door to the U n i o n Building was
completely shattered last Friday by
three Royal School of Mines (RSM)
students pushing a British Rail
trolley through it. T h e incident
occurred at around 11.20pm during
a bar extension to to mark the end
of Rag week.
The damage to the door has been
estimated at around Â£400 and the
U n i o n is hoping to claim some
m o n e y t o w a r d s the cost o f
replacement from those who did the
damage. Z o e Hellinger, U n i o n
President, commented that 'the
Union cannot continue to pay out
for any damage caused to the
building at the moment. Every
week we have to spend some money
on the gent's toilets and I am very
concerned that it is not the students
doing the damage'. She also stated
that it has been discussed to put a
special fund in next year's budget
to pay for damage to the building.
However, this would mean that
funding to clubs and societies would
have to be reduced. A U n i o n
disciplinary is being held o n
Tuesday morning to decide the fate
of the persons involved.
Applications for Student Loans
have been halted, due to the
booking up o f interview slots.
T h e Interviews, during which
application forms are filled, a r e '
necessary to obtain a loan, and are
currently booked into the N e w
Year. N o new bookings are being
taken at the moment, and students
are advised to wait until after the
Christmas holiday before making an
appointment.
