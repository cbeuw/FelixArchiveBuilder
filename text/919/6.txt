Football
O n Saturday 23rd November, IC
2nds marched to victory for the
fourth consecutive time this season.
After a slow start, the best looking
team in the Football C l u b has
picked up the momentum, having
qualified for the knockout stages of
the U A U Championship (for the
first time ever) as well as reaching
the quarter-finals of the U L U Upper
Reserves C u p .
Saturday's match in the U L U
League was approached with some
trepidation, due to the absence of
a number of regulars. While M a x
Duckworth was nursing an injured
shoulder, M i c k e y Plummer was
struggling with the finer points of
q u a n t u m g r a v i t y , and T e l l i s
Botzious was having a kick-about
in the park somewhere.
T h e opponents, K C H , attacked
vigorously in the opening moments
of the match, but I C soon imposed
their legendary passing game,
culminating in a headed goal by Phil
Cadwell. H i g h spirits were damped

without saying that the animation is
breathtaking.
The numerous songs in the film

the Jungle' and T want to be like

the most popular cartoons of all

know its well worth a second
viewing, but if you haven't this is
a great opportunity to see it.

somewhat towards the end of the
first half when 'Nigel Clough', alias
R i c h i e D i x o n , was c y n i c a l l y
studded in the knee, and required
a stretcher to be carried off the
field. Substitute Philip Hayney
b r a v e l y c o p e d with the
responsibility of replacing him.
IC's fighting character then came
to the fore, and the lead was
extended thanks to a glancing
header from Jason Devoys. A
blinding third goal from 35 yards
out by top striker Simon Barry
(universally renowned for his 'Joie
de V i v r e ' ) put the match out of
K C H ' s reach, despite a late
consolation goal and Caldwell's
undue generosity. A n d y Fenton
produced a fine performance in his
guest appearance for the team. The

So, at the end of the day, another
two points in the bag for the IC
2nds, in their quest for the title.
Fastest
Last Sunday we met Southampton
University ( S U O C ) in the Churchill
C u p in Guildford. Each team
consisted of three women and six
men, with the seven best positions
counting.
The terrain was fast, but quite
hilly and the courses were not too
hard - so it was just a question about
who was the fastest. Our girls, Tone
Nystrom, Charlotte and Orsolya
Magyar) took the first three places
respectively, thrashing the S U O C
girls.
It was then left to the guys to keep
up the standard. This they did with
some storming runs. Tamas Toth
coming second (having been beaten
by S U O C ' s British team runner),
Francis Longworth 6th, Espen
L u n d 8th and James Cunningham
11th. This was just enough to give
IC victory, but only just, with the
winning margin only being two
points.
