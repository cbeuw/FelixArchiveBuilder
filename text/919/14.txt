All About Eve/Cranes/Dr Phibes —Brixton Academy
line-up was like Joy Division
supporting... oohh, I don't know,
some twee and whimsical group like
Renaissance, but without the tun of
Renaissance-River City People?
Pop will Eat itself? Zodiac
Mindwarp and the Love Reaction?
W e l l , I could talk about the
difficulties of getting down to the
Academy and sticking out from the
rest of the audience when you're
drunken and black-clad, but I
Music Editorial
I ' m g o i n g to do s o m e t h i n g
unprecedented for a Felix M u s i c
Editor; I'm going to yield to my
audience. The reason for this is,
though you may not all be fans of
Queen, I believe their music has, at
some time or another, played a part
in all of your lives. Some of my
earliest memories of pop music
include songs like 'Seven Seas of
R h y e ' , ' K i l l e r Q u e e n ' and
'Bohemian Rhapsody', and for that
reason, I mourn the sad death of
Freddie Mercury. I also believe his
fans at IC would like to see
something written about him in their
newspaper.
It would be insincere of me to
claim to be a fan of Queen; at times
I found them pompous, bloated and
puerile. But I think they made some
genuinely great records all the
won't. The audience think you
belong to the public, the public
think you belong to the audience,
and I think I need a new mascara.
The sight of so many Hippygoths
(as opposed to Visigoths, or
Ostrogoths) o c c a s i o n s me to
wonder who they've come to see;
whatever, I'm in a cultural no-
man's-land. Dr. Phibes were quite
good, but not as good as the film,
and not good enough to have their
full name written out - I'm an
Artist! I need Space! I also need to
search frantically through the
dictionary to find new adjectives for
Cranes. It's not enough to keep
saying 'somnolent' and 'beauteous',
e v e n ' p r i m a l ' is b e c o m i n g
synonymous with staleness. So, do
Cranes ride the storm clouds over
the Elysian fields, abject and
same. 'Seven Seas of R h y e ' , ' T i e
your mother down', 'Somebody to
L o v e ' , songs that were really quite
marvellous, songs that were loved
by a whole generation and were yet
t i m e l e s s . A n y w a y , w h a t e v e r
excesses Queen were guilty of, they
were arguably the most popular
band in the world. What is more,
they were nothing without Freddie
Mercury. I was shocked to hear of
his death. The man was so alive.
The televised tribute on monday
night really hit me with that fact; his
enthusiasm, his talent, his greatest
moments. Freddie Mercury was a
star, more than anyone else in my
time, and I'm going to dig out my
copy of 'Night at the Opera' and
crank up the volume to ' T h e
Prophet Song'. People, can you
hear me?.
David Spooner
abandoned? O f course they do, and
more besides. Y o u know that. If
there's any criticism, it's that you
lose something of the atmosphere in
a large venue, not that it's terribly
big; no, more than that is the fact
that it's not supposed to be Cranes
gig and therefore not tailored to
them. N o matter. It's still a brilliant
performance.
A n d onto All About Eve. I first
heard 'In the clouds' on it's release
four years ago, and I must confess
I was rather swayed by Julianne
Regan prancing around the fluffy,
womb-like set with the band
discreetly in the background.
Where they should be. I even
bought their first album, in spite of
Wayne Hussey's involvement, and
I did quite like some of the songs
t h e r e i n . T r a n s l a t e d to this
Shit. I Just stood on the record and
it didn't break. I hate it when that
happens. 'Indie'. There is good
indie and there is bad indie.
Unfortunately for me, 'Manchester'
is a four-letter word, and 'pop' is
one I find so repulsive, I wouldn't
Sandira
Having foregone the fame and
credibility of being the Shamen's
percussionist, Sandira has chosen to
cut her own way in this world of
short lives and artistic amputation,
the wisdom of which entirely
escapes me; for female soloists to
survive in this business, and remain
unscathed, requires a stubborn,
resolute, u n c o m p r o m i s i n g
determination, and few seem to
make it.!Kate Bush, Madonna, at a
push, Belinda Carlisle. The rest,
from Joni Mitchell to Diamanda
Galas, become ' C u l t ' .
I'd better leave the issue of
inherent s e x i s m in the p o p
a u d i e n c e , ' c o s it feels l i k e
dangerous territory, and I am
supposed to be reviewing this; so,
performance, 'Every Angel', 'What
kind of fool', 'In the clouds' et
cetera, are sounding pretty tired
now. I'm sorry, but they really need
kicking for peddling the same old
shit in such an unimaginative,
notes- by-numbers routine. T h e
fiddly guitar parts and the vocal
inflections are so startlingly dull, so
meticulously rehearsed from the
originals, one wonders why they
didn't just set the tape running.
Jesus C h r i s t , in ' M a r t h a ' s
Harbour', the whole audience
repeats word for word, sigh for
s i g h , stress for stress. It's
appropriate, and sadly ironic, at the
moment to say something like 'the
Queen is dead: L o n g live the
Q u e e n ' , but a dead F r e d d i e
Mercury has so much more life than
a live All About Eve.

inflict it on my mother.
'This is Manchester indie pop'.
A l l the devilish imps numbered in
Satan's minions would surely find
themselves on the ends of their own
toasting forks were they to utter
these words, and lest ye lose your
street cred for all eternity, I guard
you, never speak in such terms.
A n d as for the halfway danceable
'B'-side, well, you wouldn't want
to listen to it anyway.
Seb and his bastard squitty
half-brother.
there are three songs on this, her
first solo effort, and they're really
quite s p l e n d i d . T h e r i c h l y
percussive opening gives way to
some crisp guitar work not unlike
M c G e o c h - e r a Banshees and a
shivery vocal ranging from a flat
haughtiness to an edgy falsetto. This
is f o l l o w e d by a d e l i g h t f u l
mediaeval piece straight out of the
Dead Can Dance catalogue, but
with a slightly more tangible grip
on the twentieth century, which is
more than can be said for it's grip
on reality as we are again treated
to a jarring vocal delivery. Our final
pleasure is another bizarre wander
through banshee territory, but this
is genuine banshee wailing, not M r s
Budgie's affected coldness; it's
m o r e o d d l y d e t a c h e d . A
:onceivable criticism of female
vocalists in pop is that they are not
as adaptable as their m a l e
counterparts, but such as Sandira
should redress the balance. I live in
hope.
