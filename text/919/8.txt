Last Thursday Dr John Gribbon,
N e w Scientist Physics Corres-
pondent, presented a talk on the
'Greenhouse Effect'. T h e Earth has
two types o f greenhouse effect—a
natural and an anthropogenic
greenhouse effect. In the former,
solar energy absorbed through the
atmosphere warms the Earth's
surface. Infra-red radiation is then
radiated from the Earth's surface
and trapped in the atmosphere
mainly by carbon dioxide and water
vapours, thus keeping the Earth
warm. T h e moon, although an

carbon dioxide, chloroflurocabons
(which did not exist until the
1930s), methane and nitrous oxide.
Until the 1980s the temperature
change on Earth was not thought to
be significant, but the eight warmest
years on record have occured in the
past eleven years, the top four years
being 1987, 1988, 1990 and 1991.
Indeed, the coldest years o f the
1980s were hotter than the warmest
years of the 1880s.

equal distance from the sun, has no
atmosphere, no greenhouse effect
and an average surface temperature
of — 2 0 ° C . T h e Earth has an
average surface temperature o f
15°C and so the greenhouse effect
keeps the Earth 3 5 ° C warmer than
it otherwise would be.
O v e r the last 100 years there has
been a rise in the average surface
temperature o f the Earth o f Vi°C'
T h e sea level has also risen by an
average o f 15cm, exactly the
amount expected from thermal
expansion of the upper ocean layers
from the Vi ° C temperature rise. In
the sub-tropics there has been a
decline in rainfall, and in higher
latitudes there has been an increase
in extreme weather. Over the last
century there has also been a
dramatic change in the composition
o f the a t m o s p h e r e i n c l u d i n g
increasing concentrations o f the
greenhouse gases (i.e. those gases
measuring equipment) are thought
to be due to the anthropogenic
greenhouse effect, that is the extra
warming of the planet has been due
to man's production o f more
greenhouse gases.
Over the last one hundred years
the atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentration has increased by
25 %, from 280 parts per million to
350ppm, which is significant,
considering that the former figure
contributed to a 'greenhouse effect'
of 3 5 ° C .
O f the present annual emissions
of carbon dioxide of 5l
h billion
tonnes, the U n i t e d States
contributes 2 5 % , Britain 3 % and
China 10% (illustrating how a small
proportion of the world population,
i.e. developed countries, has a
disproportionate share o f the
planet's resources).
F r o m radiocarbon analysis o f
methane trapped in air bubbles in
ice in the Antarctic, there has been
a dramatic build up o f methane in
the a t m o s p h e r e . M e t h a n e is
produced mainly by bacteria i n
swamps and the guts o f ruminants.
Some methane is also produced
from degrading waste in landfill
sites. Methane traps twenty times as
much energy as carbon dioxide
molecule for molecule. C F C s are
low in c o n c e n t r a t i o n in the
atmosphere but are still building up
rapidly and molecule for molecule
absorb 10,000 times as much heat
as carbon dioxide. Thus carbon
dioxide is only half o f the problem.
Computer models to predict the
effects of global warming have been
criticised because of differences in
p r e d i c t e d t e m p e r a t u r e rises.
However, the difference between
predictions o f a 2 ° C and a 4 ° C
temperature rise i f the atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentration was to
double, is not significant when
measured on the K e l v i n scale. T h e
doubling o f the pre-industrial
carbon dioxide concentration is
predicted to occur the year 2030
(assuming a 2 % annual increase in
carbon dioxide emissions) and the
expected average temperature rise
is 3 . 5 ° C . A similar temperature
change occured during the end o f
the last ice age (10,000 years ago)
over a 4000 year period. However,
the predicted 3 . 5 ° C temperature
change will occur in only 40 years,
a rise o f about 1 ° C per decade.
Ecologists studying the adaptation
and evolution o f ecosystems say that
ecosystems could perhaps adapt to
a 1 ° C rise per century but not in just
ten years. Therefore by the year
2 0 3 0 natural u n m a n a g e d
ecosystems will be very rare with
most ecosystems having to be
highly managed.
Sea levels may rise by up to 1
metre by the year 2030 leading to
many more refugees from coastal
areas where many farmers in
developing countries live. In the
N i l e Delta this sea level rise would
affect five million people (assuming
there is no population increase) with
17% o f Egypt's agricultural land
being lost to the sea. T h e deserts o f
the sub-tropics will spread towards
the poles resulting in potential mass
migration away from the deserts.
Hurricanes are basically driven by
heat and as ocean temperatures
increase hurricanes will become
stronger and more frequent in
higher latitudes.
But, how accurate are these
predictions? A recent article in the
New Scientist (23.11.91) describes
a new theory that a lot o f the
t e m p e r a t u r e c h a n g e s c a n be
e x p l a i n e d as solar variation..
However, previous work (see the
same article) projected that the
