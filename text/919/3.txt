Staff
Meeting
1 2 . 3 0 p m
M o n d a y 2 n d
D e c e m b e r
to discuss the
Christmas
Felix and
deadlines.
Be there or be
somewhere
else.
The E G M on Thursday I felt was
m o d e r a t e l y s u c c e s s f u l i n
comparison with previous efforts.
There were a decent number o f
people and the serious motions were
discussed before quorum brought
the meeting to a premature end (see
the report on the news pages). Not
that I was terribly upset by quorum
being called as one o f the motions
to be discussed was one that would
have mandated me to be Parker
from the Thunderbirds.
T h i n g s are hotting u p f o r
Sherfield Management. This week
an article in the Guardian put the
boot in for them claiming they were
heavy handed and totally profit
orientated. W e at the Felix office
received a letter from the Chairman
of the Academic Staff Assembly,
Professor C T Shaw, to the Rector,
Sir Eric A s h , in which Prof Shaw
said the Sherfield Administration
'could be inappropriate for an
academic institution.' H e adds that
'academic staff now feel that they
have little or no say in the running
of their college...there has been a
profound loss o f confidence i n
College management.'

This week some laminated A 3 size
full colour photographs were put on
display by person o r persons
u n k n o w n i n the M e c h a n i c a l
E n g i n e e r i n g B u i l d i n g . T h e y
depicted, in graphic detail, the
mutilation and presumed death o f
large numbers o f people. They are
now in the possession o f the Union
Office. Whoever owns them can
collect them from there, and explain
what they are while they're at it.
Fellow editors
Congratulations are in order for
A d a m Tinworth, editor o f Queen
M a r y and Westfield College's
student newspaper ' C u b ' f o r
managing to get their Student Union
to cough up a minimal amount for
its continuance. H e has been
struggling valiantly against Union
disfavour and appears to be slowly
convincing them o f the usefulness
of an editorially free and reasonably
high quality college newspaper. The
more student newspapers the better
- there are too many student unions
who consider a newspaper a luxury,
when it is a necessity if the student
body is to be well informed. M r
Tinworth has told me o f how much
better informed students with
c o l l e g e n e w s p a p e r s were i n
comparison with colleges without
newspapers.
Odds and Ends
S o m e b o d y has o r d e r e d t h e
emplacement o f a large metal pipe
which is framing the entrance to the
Felix Office. It is obvious, ugly and
I can guarantee that it will come
down during one o f the more high
spirited events that the quad is home
to.
O u r Token American (Jennifer)
has informed me that yesterday, 28
November, was Thanksgiving Day.
I don't suppose that turkeys have
much cause for thanks. I a m not
entirely sure what thanks are due
for or to whom they are to be given.
Perhaps we should just be thankful
that those who give thanks are
generally o n the other side o f the
Atlantic. Happy Thanksgiving.
Thankyou.
