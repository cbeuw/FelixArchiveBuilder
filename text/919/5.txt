it must be handed over. Obviously
no one could attend to a mascot 24
hours a day, so back to the detective
work to find the hiding place. Also,
functions could not be disrupted i f
the bearer was anywhere in the
function, and the mascots, safe with
their bearers, would be seen around
college a lot more.
T h e s e rules m a y not c o v e r
everything, but with luck, wisdom
will prevail.
In summary, I believe that
mascotry in its present form at I C
is an abomination, but Mascotry in
its pure and intended form has many
positive aspects. It is only a
personal view, but I think it is
possible to revive the original
concept.

Palestine Speaker
Dear Adam,
In response to the replies to my
letter concerning the invitation o f a
P L O representative to speak in this
college, I would just like to make
a few comments.
First o f all, both' o f the letters
implied that the P L O is the only
legitimate v o i c e - p i e c e o f the
Palestinian people. T h e P L O have
never been elected as their official
political body and in fact, any
Palestinian would. be terrified o f
standing in opposition to them for
fear o f being murdered.
Secondly, according to one of the
letters 'There have been more
Palestinians killed over the past
three years than Israelis'. This may
very well be so, but what is not
mentioned is the fact that in the
large majority o f cases, the killing
of Palestinians has been carried out
by their o w n k i n d , f o r
collaboration, rather than by
Israelis. I would also question the
terminology used by H o Y i n W o n g
and Tobias Schrag who write
concerning the justified 'restoration
of the Palestinian State'. F o r the
needs of peace and security, I would
fully support the creation o f a
Palestinian State but I can in no way
agree with their claim that one has
existed in the past.
Lee Matthews, the treasurer o f
the Anti W a r in the G u l f Society
(now the Just Peace in the Middle
East Society) who put on the
meeting, claims in the other letter
that it was wrong of me to speculate
on the reasons for the imprisonment
o f the P L O r e p r e s e n t a t i v e .
Nevertheless, I don't understand
why he can't put an end to m y
speculation, however misguided it
is, by stating for what reason this
person was placed in an Israeli
prison for ten years as a member of
the P L O . Political aspects aside,
I'm sure that he can appreciate how
it is possible for someone to feel
threatened by having a possible
m u r d e r e r o f innocent people
speaking freely in their college.
I agree completely that it is only
with the exchange o f views from
both sides that eventual peace will
be reached. I would suggest,
however, that the next time a debate
on this issue is held by the society,
a spokesman from the Israeli side
is invited and I hope that they think
more carefully about the choice for
the opposing speaker.
Yours sincerely,
Gaby Pell, Physics 2.
Disgraceful Dutch Guilds Security
Dear Editor,
In response to a letter by a fellow
countryman in last week's Felix, I
would like to state the following:
Dutch law isn't brilliant, it is
disgraceful. Sex at 12, who wants
to have sex with a girl with no hair
(sorry Sinead O ' C o n n o r ) . I mean
where do you rest the eggwhisk?
James B r o w n was mistaken when
he said money was the root o f all
evil. He omitted alcohol, alongside
cash. I never drink it o r talk to
people who do. It is a sad substance
for sad persons with no brain
power. A s for drugs...don't ask.
I a m therefore arranging a
weekend at m y house in Holland,
where we will walk the streets o f
Amsterdam as a protest against the
government. Have no fear I will
protect you all from the vices.
Ualpy Fitzgerald.
Bernard Sunley.
Ramming Evolution
D e a r Adam,
Re. R a m m i n g
Isn't it amazing how narrow-
minded some people are? If a
Christian were to write in an article
as narrow-minded and ill-reasoned
as Professor Scorer's Legacy of
Evolution, they would be accused
of blatantly ramming their beliefs
down other people's throats, and
probably forbidden from writing
anything o f the sort again. So why
does Prof Scorer get away with it?
M o s t p e o p l e r e a d i n g P r o f
Scorer's article would believe that
evolution is a true fact, whereas
Christianity is just belief. T h e fact
is that neither one can be proved or
d i s p r o v e d . T h r o u g h o u t o u r
education we are taught that the
whole world operates according to
simple mathematical rules, without
the interaction o f a G o d . This
assumption is the foundation o f
m o d e r n science. W e are a l l
brainwashed from a very early age
into thinking that the world has no
need for G o d , and few o f us have
the guts to rebel against this.
It's funny: people complain about
Christians ramming their beliefs
down other people's throats, but
atheists are much worse. I probably
knew about evolution from primary
school, yet I never knew what
Christianity was really about until
I was sixteen. It's amazing how few
p e o p l e a c t u a l l y k n o w what
Christianity is about—it's not a
question o f ' i f you're good, you go
to heaven'. W h y not broaden your
horizons, and find out?

Dear Editor,
I feel it necessary to write to you
in response to your editorial in issue
918 a n d i n p a r t i c u l a r y o u r
comments on the drunkeness of the
security at Guilds Carnival. T o
quote 'most of these additional and
very necessary helpers were totally
drunk early in the evening'. I admit
that there was one particular case
of excessive drinking brought to my
attention and this person was dealt
with and other people brought in to
cover.
However, on the whole security
was excellent and this is, in the
main, due to the hard work on the
night o f the G u i l d s Security
coordinator, M a r k Jackson. H e
reported no problems, other than
the a f o r e m e n t i o n e d , to m e
throughout the night.
When there was the possibility of
some trouble, this was dealt with
efficiently by our own people and
M a n d y H u r f o r d , the U n i o n
Manager.
So, I w o u l d like to thank
everyone who helped with security
at the Guilds Carnival and everyone
who helped in any other way. In
particular I would like to thank
M a r k Jackson and M a n d y Hurford
for their respective help and advice,
during and before the event.
Finally, a couple o f further points.
Firstly, it would be nice if you could
stop treating Felix as your personal
soap box. A n d , secondly, you are
constantly complaining about the
apathy at I C and I agree with you.
However, Felix, in its current
format, does little to inspire
anything except apathy.
Yours non-apathetically,
Steve Hoborough,
C&G College Union Ents Chair.
Please print in full.
My complaints as to the efficacy
of Guilds Security on the night in
question was directed at some of
the stewards rather than the
.Security Co-ordinators. I
apologise for any confusion in this
matter.
As to my using Felix as a
'personal soap box'; what do you
suppose editorials are for? Do you
expect my to say that everything
is just tickety-boo every week? It
isn't, and you would have more
cause for complaint if I was that
complacent.
Any suggestions as to how to
improve Felix will be gratefully
received, provided that they are
realistic. I fail to see how
changing the 'format' of Felix
would inspire the student body to
anything better. I can't really see
that changing from Times Roman
to Univers body text a n d
increasing the size to a tabloid, or
even rearranging the page layout
would do anything save cause
confusion. It takes issues to
mobilise public opinion, not
newspaper aesthetics.
-Adam.
