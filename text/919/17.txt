Let me introduce myself. I am the
Felix Roving Reporter catching up
on all the juicy news around
college. If there is a name that you
want to mar, just drop in a little note
into the features pigeon hole
addressed to me and I will do my
best to dig up the dirt.
A s for now, the betting has
opened as to w h o m will succeed in
taking the 'hand' o f T a m s i n , the
young raggie. A s we understand it
the following people are out to get
her (in the nicest possible way of
course!): Martin Heighway 5:1,
Stuart Rison 3:1, Richard Eyers
4:1, Stef Smith 7:1, Clare A s h
50:1, Howie 2:1 (fav), W i l l 7:2,
Simon 4:1, T o b y Jones 6:1. So,
those of you who have seen the film
Dangerous Liaisons will understand
this, we want written proof!
Anyone caught 'sharking' after this
d e l i g h t f u l y o u n g lady w i l l
automatically be added to the stakes
whether they like it or not.
I can now name the people who
are losing their life membership
because of the Theta saga; Dave
Burns, James Savage, Gareth
S m i t h , G o r d o n B r i g n a l , Paul
Wilmott and Paul Errington. Y o u ' d
have thought that people with
degrees would have had a little
more sense than that wouldn't you?
O n second thoughts, maybe not.

" O r g a n i s a t i o n s which have joined
the milkround since the printing of
the brochure—further details are
available from the Careers Office.
T h e following have cancelled
their visits: B B C , Pilkington,
Norwest Hoist and R T Z .
The following are amendments to
the brochure. Coopers Lybrand
Deloitte are interviewing at their
own premises not at Imperial (page
6), Geco-prakla presentation is on
February 19th not the 22nd (page
10) and fhe closing date for Albright
and Wilson is the 6th of January and
not the 27th (page 4).
Keep an eye on the noticeboard
outside of room 308 Sherfield for
all M i l k r o u n d details and updates.
Presentation details are also on the
noticeboards outside the Careers
Centre.
T a l k i n g o f w h i c h the N u d e
Kamikaze Parachute jump was
absolutely brilliant this year, those
of you who didn't turn up missed
out on a good thing. Nine naked
bodies jumping out of the back of
a mini-bus and running for it
(except for Steve Farrant and Paul
Thomas who walked) is just what
everybody needs first thing on a
Saturday morning and so a new
Society is going to be set up - T h e
Saturday Streak Soc plans to streak
for their College all round the U . K .
and raise money for Rag in the
process (we're not all exhibitionists,
honest!).
A f t e r seeing the m o t i o n s
forwarded for this weeks E G M I
have heard it being discussed that
Imperial College should become an
Automonus State and trade under
the name of P R I C - Peoples
Republic of Imperial College -
everything will be made legal
including sex (with anything and
anybody), drugs (in all recognised/
unrecognised forms) and sausage
rolls (which will be made available
at subsidised prices to passport
holders). Money to finance the State
would come from taking over all the
streets connecting parts of the
college and charging motorists and
pedestrians humungous amounts of
money to pass! A n y o n e wishing to
O n 2nd of November, D r Michael
Mermikides died aged 50. H e had
be ill for only a few months with
cancer. A former member of the
reserch staff in H i g h Energy
Physics at Imperial College, he had
gained an acknowledged reputation
in the p a r t i c l e a c c e l e r a t o r
laboratories at D E S Y ( H a m b u r g )
and CERN(Geneva) and throughout
the world-wide physics community.
A member of the large A L E P H
c o l l a b o r a t i o n f r o m its v e r y
inception, he was noted among
other things, for his important work
in computer modelling the T i m e
Projection Chamber of the A L E P H
detectors. His labours were in fact
far-reaching, his name a recurring
feature on reserch papers. His
contributions to the computer
software were many and essential
to the success of the common effort
and his c o m p e t e n t fund o f
knowledge on experiment was
always available to colleagues.
H e remained a member of the
A L E P H c o l l a b o r a t i o n after
accepting an invitation to join the
prestigious Supercomputer Reserch
Institute at Tallahassee Florida.
Recently, he made a significant
contribution to the hunt for
leptoquarks, an as yet undiscovered
type of particle, that may improve
our understanding of the Universe.
A related reserch paper is being
dedicated to his memory.
Michael was a Greek educated in
Paris. A diffident and modest man,
he had wide cultural interests,
indeed one could be disconcerted by
his i n f o r m e d k n o w l e d g e and
balanced critcism of music, theatre
and art. His zest for life and nature
found expression in scuba diving,
a love of marine life and the sea in
every respect, but as a sailor he
seemed to confirm the reputation ,
perhaps u n j u s t i f i e d , o f his
compatriots.
Despite the enormity of the H E P
endeavours, the multi-national and
dispersed character, its success in
part owes much to the strong,
traditional sense of community
spirit. High Energy Physics has lost
a gentle p h y s i c i s t and a
conscientious servant, it mourns
him.
Michael leaves a devoted wife
and two children.
second this motion please contact
N i c k or Trigger in the Guilds
office.
So, goodbye for now, I'll be back
next week if anything interesting
happens around college. M i n d you,
this slot will probably look very
empty as all the students round here
are far to apathetic to do anything
scandalous!
