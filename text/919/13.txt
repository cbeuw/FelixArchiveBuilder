lf?/Airstream/Natural Life/Deja Vu—Astoria
A bloke beside me, let's call h i m
M a r k to protect the innocent/naive,
turns to me and tells me that Deja
Vu are brilliant, Natural Life are
brilliant, Airstream are brilliant,
and If? are f-ing brilliant.' W e l l
then, what a good night I'm in for i
here. But, dear heart, that is his
opinion.
3(a) When performing live, all
bands shall say 'Hello, we 're...'
followed by the name of your band.
This ensures that all the people
present will know who you are. The
importance of doing this increases
the further down the bill you are.'
( E E C Directive for live music
performance, 1987).
A s the lead singer o f the first
band doesn't do this, but instead
replaces it with the words 'Hello
L o n d o n ' , I draw the following
conclusions: that he has an ' O ' -
Level i n geography; that he is a
wanker and thirdly that he doesn't
Tori Amos —Me and a Gun
A h h , more delectable produce from
the d i v i n e l y l o v e l y EastWest
( W E A , o r Warners, to y o u ) .
W i t h o u t doubt o u r favourite
fluffsome record label. In their
ranks are such as Sisters of Mercy,
R.E.M., the Psychedelic Furs,
Dinosaur Jr, Leonard Cohen, Enya,
the Jesus and Mary Chain and loads
of others. They have quite a cool
roster, a l l things considered.
Warners, we love y o u . W e really
do.
So now I'm going to talk about
Tori Amos. T h e lead track on this
debut release is a piano ballad called
'Silent all these years', which seems
to have had a reasonable amount o f
radio airplay of late. It y o u haven't
The End —Gusto
heard it, believe m e , it's well
deserved. A t times it's almost like
an American Kate Bush circa ' M a n
with the C h i l d i n his eyes' (if ever
I was a sucker for a song, it's this
one), with more than a touch o f
nursery rhyme creepiness in a
sparse p i a n o l i n e . S i m i l a r l y
exquisite orchestrations well up
behind a lovely chorus, and then
vanish into the rocking-horse room
again, clouded by some terribly
obscure lyrics touching o n a
relationship and, ooh, all those little
things that contribute to the big love
thing o r , alternatively, y o u r
swelling compulsion to murder a
close friend or relative with an
astonishing brutality. O r even
imbecilic Americans. It's either
blind luck or sheer talent that allows
this bewildering commentary to
belong to both psychologies without
'belonging', if you get my meaning.
If I knew, I'd hate it, but I'll be
sharpening knives for Christmas.

I have a n irrational fear o f
keyboards; itty ditty namby pamby
shite bands like Erasure use them.
This is also enough to provide
grounds for my fear. Carter also use
keyboards.
Unfortunately, The End seem to
think that keyboards are vital to a
musically fulfilling life. Crap. This
isn't ny only gripe, The End
wouldn't know what originality was
if it was fish-shaped and similarly
perfumed (Eau delectable-Ed) and
slapping them around the kischkas.
A n y b o d y w h o spells ' m y s e l f
' m a s e l f has got to be wacky, and
wacky correlates and is directly
proportional to kickass. Originality.
(Startling blinding mellifluous kings
of tension-Ed). Bollocks.
Musically (and musically-Ed)
they sound like a Manchester fad
crew gone soft-cock-glam-goth-
rock. That good. (That Good?-Ed).
Choruses with the refrain Tt must
be p o w e r b l i n d ' repeated a d
infinitum do not pump my nads. It
must be the good o f rawk and roll
Billy Idol voice. Kris Kristofferson
was never this good, and that's the
clincher. Hairy weird- bearded
slugger buggers. (How's that for
creative editing?)
T h e t w i n - s c o r e d effigies o f
J e r e m o t h
want me to know who he is or buy
any o f his records. This band has
three drummers. Is this really
necessary? It comes together quite
well, mind, in a Happy Mondays,
Farmy sort o f way.
Airstream do better by having a sign
behind them saying Airstream. This
is very good, and they obviously
have a professional attitude to live
performance. If I told y o u that
Airstream are the future of popular
music, would y o u hear me? W o u l d
you listen to me? W o u l d y o u
believe me? W e l l they are. N o
sixties retro rubbish, no psychedelic
feedback, just plain and simple
catchy tunes. G r o o v y stuff, and no
mistake. Believe it.
If?'s singer says ' H e l l o , this
band's called If?'. This complies
with all regulations, apart from the
Silly Punctuation In Band Names
act 1964, but I can ignore that.
Their light show is quite superb, but
unfortunately it's not good enough
to distract me from their hard-
edged, but harmless, wannabe EMF
sound. Packaged, prefab pop by
numbers. Well, it could be deja v u ,
it sounds like it.

Ocean Colourscene —Brunei
Ocean Colour Scene, are like
Blur but better, with more life,
style, variety, pazazz. If y o u like
Blur, y o u are undoubtedly the
possessor of an incomparable lack
of musical taste, but you'll probably
like this more. In fact, i f y o u
compare them to Blur, they look
quite favourable on all counts. If,
on the other hand, y o u were to
compare them to anyone else, y o u
might be a mite disappointed. They
introduce one o f their singles,
Sway, with "this is an old s o n g " ,
but the thought occurs to me, that
they are all old songs, just rehashed
and reborn, and that their old songs
sound indistinguishable from their
newer songs, with a lack o f
p r o g r e s s , a n d d e v e l o p m e n t .
Darwin's theory o f evolution has
evidently not reached Manchester
yet, or are this band just a
malingering reminder of times past,
caught in a bubble in time. Heavy
stuff.
