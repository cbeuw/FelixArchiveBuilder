The Inner System
Chapter 7:
Information.
Troy Tempest
leads us into the
War Zone
Sid Hiimae
finally gets
published in a
decent student
newspaper and I
accept the bribe
'This is the newsroom.'
Stress watched as a female in the
centre of the large room began
talking to a camera in front o f her.
'This is the newsroom. T h e
stories today: A n outbreak o f
athletes' foot has been found
amongst the dorks. If you are a dork
and do have this illness, do not be
afraid to report it. It will not affect
your trend rating. Also in the news,
the new skateboards are ready, so
will geeks please report to supplies
for the new boards. Finally, our
main story! A victory has been won
in the perimeter war. T o bring y o u
news o f this we go over to our
reporter at the scene.'
She turned to her left and became
motionless. The camera's light went
out and an assistant darted forward.
H e unbuttoned the back of the
newscaster's blouse and removed a
cassette from a slot in her back,
replacing it with another one. Stress
looked up at one of the large screens
on the front wall as a tanned
reporter appeared, gunfire and
explosions behind him.
'I'm reporting from the war zone.
With me is the inner system army
leader.'
The goat looked up from its prone
position in the straw, gave me an
expression of utter weariness and
vague surprise, then promptly
expired. T h e two tiny corpses
deposited behind it in a slime o f
afterbirth had been too much for its
old and knackered system, so
instead of two new lives that
afternoon three deaths were added
to the roster.
M y father came out of the house
and stomped up the steps from what
used to be the patio before the rot
of negligence set in and leant
against the door of the shed.
'Bugger, it died d i d it?'
I should point out at this juncture
that he hated goats almost as much
as I do, but I suspect that had the
daily chores o f milking and feeding
been his, all vestiges o f tolerance
would have vanished.
Since the bodies were unfit for
the pot, methods o f disposal were
then discussed; the knackers yard
was ruled out (they would actually
want money to take them away by
G o d ! ) a n d M u g g i n s was
volunteered for the dirty work.
T h e camera shifted left to gaze at
a deeply tanned, very well built rnan
wearing shorts and every major
weapon imaginable.
'General, is the fighting still as
fierce as when y o u took this sector
of the outer areas from them?'
T h e camera zoomed in on the
general's grand canyon o f a face.
Muscles twitched and eyes darted
as the general thought.
' Y e h . '
' T h e y are trying to retake the
zone then?'
' Y e h . '
' H a v e y o u suffered h e a v y
casualties?'
' Y e h . '
' A n d have y o u . . . '
A t that point the general reached
into his arsenal, brought forth a
pistol the size o f a small tank and
fired it down the corridor. T h e
camera swivelled as the target
toppled backwards, dropping the
bomb it had been carrying and fell
to the floor. T h e general and the
reporter ran over to the prone form.
' Y e u c k ! It's horrible!!'
T h e camera passed over the
gaping bloody hole in the dead
man's chest and zoomed in on his
' W e ' v e got a big garden and
there's a spade and wheelbarrow
over there' was the verdict 'at least
four feet deep for the goat, the kids
can go out in the rubbish'.
I think it was November, but it
was certainly cold and damp at the
end of the garden as I dug that
grave. F o u r feet deep by the area
of a goat is a hell o f a lot o f hard
earth to dig. I had plenty of time to
contemplate as the drizzle fell and
the light dwindled, and by the time
it was dug I fully understood why
grave diggers are supposed to be a
pathologically morose lot.
W h e n at last I had a hole that
seemed to be large enough, I was
thoroughly anxious to get the whole
business over with. So I trudged
back down the garden to collect the
cadaver. I'm afraid that I was rather
unceremonious as I dumped the
body in the wheelbarrow, took it to
the graveside and tipped it into the
hole.
It was then that tragedy struck, or
should I say stuck. T h e goat had its
legs sticking rigidly out from its
body in rigor mortis and was firmly
head.
' P a l e s k i n , y e l l o w teeth,
dandruff, greasy hair and spots!'
The camera closed in on the face,
bringing the red and yellow lumps
into view, it panned across the
volcanic region into the snowy
heights above. In the newsroom
Stress watched as the tanned,
blemish free personnel screwed up
their faces in disgust, some turning
their eyes away. O n e o f the
operators clutched his mouth and
ran from the room.
O n the screen the reporter stood
up, visibly shaken.
' H e r e w e see o n e o f the
disgusting creatures that surround
our system, constantly trying to
break through and overwhelm us.
If it was not for the endless work
of the army and government we
would be destroyed in hours.'
T h e large screen went dark, the
camera light went on and the
newscaster started moving again.
' A harrowing story there from
our reporter in the war zone. That's
all from the newsroom for now,
stay tuned.'
T h e lights around her went dark
and the camera light turned off. The
woman next to Stress started
crawling back down the tunnel.
' F o l l o w me and I'll tell y o u
everything.'
wedged in the top o f its grave with
its head staring up at me in an
expression o f yellow toothed
malice.
T h e drizzle by this time had
started to bear more than a passing
resemblance to full blown rain, the
wind had picked up and the light
was fading fast. A l l that was
required was a couple of lightning
flashes and Vlad Dracul would have
felt quite at h o m e i n that
Hertfordshire garden.
In short I wanted that corpse
buried and buried fast, so I jumped
on it.
In life that goat had been known,
unoriginally perhaps, as Snowy to
my younger brothers due to its dirty
white fur. T o me it had usually
answered to Youferkinbastard. It
got its revenge. O n the point of
breathing its last it had inhaled its
terminal breath rather than the
traditional exhaling its last.
M y boots connected with its
ribcage.
Baaaaaaaa!
I solemnly swear that B e n
Johnson on a six pack of steroids
would have been eating m y dust on
the way back down that garden.
