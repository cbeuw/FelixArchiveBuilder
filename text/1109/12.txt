THA BOMB
MUSIC 27 February 1998
Tick, Tick, Tick, Tick, BOOM!! Tha Bomb is back after a one week lay off and its bigger
and badder than before.
What up!!! Check this shit out, a whole page,
yeah that's right a whole page. Is this hot or
what? I was checking thru' Felix and I spotted
that the dance techno guys have a whole page
for their column, Electric Cafe, and then 1 saw
that IC Radio had a whole page, well at this point
I decided 1 want a page and look at this I have a
whole page (big props to jason and Alok, the
music editors). A whole page means a whole
host of new stuff, check this out. You got the
normal ranting and raving from me, as well as
album reviews for the real deal phat stuff, classic
trax all about the classics from back on the day
and whatever other shit I
can think of, this is Tha
Bomb.
Did y'all all see the
Brit Awards? I caught
most of it, soul was in
the house and s o m e
awards even came this
way, the biggest being
Best Female and Best
Male going to Shola and
Finlay. But what the fuck
was going on with the
duet between Texas and
M e t h o d M a n ? That was
fucked, there w a s no
point, someone said to
me that the rap just
ruined a pretty g o o d
song and I'd have to
agree. Rumours of the
N W A get-together have
been confirmed; Dre, Ice
Cube and Yella will all be
getting together for a track on the soundtrack of
the new Cube movie. Eazy-E won't be there for
obvious reasons and I ain't sure 'bout M C Ren.
The hot news in hip-hop is the Snoop D o g g situ-
ation, basically Snoop wants to leave Death Row.
Recently he told the press that his life was in
danger and with most of the people at Death
Row either in prison or dead he's probably got a
point. Another factor is the quality of his music,
his last album Tha Doggfather was the worst
thing to c o m e out of Death Row, the boy seri-
ously needs to hook up with Dr Dre and start
bringin' their skillz together to create the quality
that we saw on The Chronic and the classic
Doggstyle. Saying all that, rumour has it that
Snoop has already signed a new deal with anoth-
er record label and has already started working
with Dre. The fact that he's signed to a six album
deal at Death Row doesn't seem to matter, keep
an eye on this situation it could all get quite
nasty.
This week sees the release of some wicked
little tunes and they're even on UK release, so we
don't need to spend a fortune buying imports.
First up is Holler by Ginuwine this has been
around for a while and most consider it the best
track off the album, phat bass line with the G
M a n ' s soild vocals and
a pretty g o o d rap make
this a w i c k e d tune.
Q u e e n Pen delivers her
album this week and to
conincide c o m e s the
first single Man Behind
the Music, this first hit
as an import in
September and blew up
back then, this is still a
track though. The
Teddy p r o d u c t i o n is
slick with the s w i n g
beats in full effect and
the other members of
Blackstreet even turn
up for the hook, there
are no real remixes to
talk of and ya better off
getting the album. The
soul man Lynden David
Hall is back with the sec-
o n d cut from his
acclaimed debut set, the track's called Do I
Quality this is a serious bit of soul, returning to
the basics of simple tune and inspired vocals. If
you missed Sexy Cinderalla the first bomb from
his LP that's on the b-side, the remixes aren't
bad, for the connoisseur this is a must. The R&B
track blowing up on import is The Weekend from
the Ride soundtrack, strangely the record c o m -
pany has decided to give it an early release date
rather than waiting the normal year or so, and for
that we should be thankful, this is a TUNE. I ain't
gonna say how g o o d it is cause you should
already know, this ...well just buy it, you won't be
disappointed.
Snoop and Deathrow fighting to part
ways, but who will get their way? We'll
just have to wait and see.
The Phat Selection
You Make Me Wanna - Usher
Usher still there doin' the business with this
phat tune, even if its been out for a long time
this still rocks.
The Weekend - Dave Hollister
TUNE, R&£ at its best with Redman and Erick
Sermon with the rap.
Wishing O n A Star - Jay-Z
Remake of the old classic with Jay-Z doin' a
little rap, simple but a tune.
My Melody (LP) - Queen Pen
Check the review o n this... W i c k e d .
Holler - Ginuwine
Best cut from the album, gets a release on
British this week, Timbalands production is
phat.
So Good - Davina
So G o o d , nuff said!
Dangerous • Busta Rhymes
Second cut from 'When Disaster Strikes', this
doesn't live up to the hype of 'Put Your
Hands...' but still quality.
No, No, No - Destiny's Child
Wicked, head nod delight.
O n an album front, there really ain't nothing
worth chatting about. The Q u e e n Pen has been
the best so far and that's reviewed here. Besides
that '98 has been low on real quality, some stuff
has c o m e thru' on import but nothing really blew
up. The much hyped Jagged Edge album is said
to not have lived up to the hype, the tune The
Way That You Talk made expectations real high,
but the album just couldn't live up to it. The Ride
soundtrack is the only thing to have caused any
damage on the scene, but even that wasn't out-
standing, the lack of any real competition proba-
bly gave it such hype. Looking to the future there
is some smart stuff to come, the pick is probably
the Faith Evans joint from the Bad Boy family,
which has already got hype, the new Aretha
Franklin album (first single already out and
wicked, more next week) and the one I'm look-
ing forward to most the Tony Rich album. If the
new Rich album is anything like the last then
we're in for a treat. Gangstarr, 'nuff said.

Class!
The Chronic - Dr Dre
The album that really started the whole West
Coast thang going. N W A had just broken up,
with Ice Cube the only real man on the west
coast, but from nowhere Dr Dre and Death Row
were unleashed. Dr Dre took us on a journey
into the G-Funk Era. 'The Chronic' was an intro-
duction to brand new style and some new faces
- The Death Row Inmates - D O C , Kurupt, That
Nigga Daz, Lady of Rage and of course the big
d o g Snoop. The amazing production from Dre
may never be surpassed by the man again, the
killer cut from the album was the stunning
Nuthin' But a C Thang, which featured more laid
back gangsta vocals from Snoop. Wit Dre Day
was a straight dis to Eazy-E and everyone who
ever cussed the West Coast. Next up was the
classy Let Me Ride a wicked piece of head nod,
sampling the P-funk king George Clinton's
Mothership Connection, with Jewel on back-
ground vocals and RBX &. S n o o p helping Dre
with the rap this was always destined to be a
standout track. A s well as those the album was
packed with other gems, Lil Chetta Boy, Rat-
Tat-Tat-Tat and many others. Dre delivered an
all time classic, if you ani't got it, get it.
