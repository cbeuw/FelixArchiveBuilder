ACCESS FUNDS
SPRING TERM 1998
Application forms for assistance from the Access Fund
are now available from the College's Student Finance
Office, Room 334 of the Sherfield Building.
Any full-time, home student of the College experiencing
serious financial hardship is invited to collect an
application which has to be returned to the above office
by 27 March. Applications will be considered from
those who received funds earlier this session, but
priority will be given to those seeking help for the first
time.
Undergraduate students should note that applications can
only be accepted from those who have taken out a
student loan for the current session.
The funds are limited so priority will be given to the
following categories of student:
(1) Those paying their own tuition fees and
(2) Those with additional expenditure over and above
standard student costs. For example, extra medical
or childcare expenditure.
Please ensure that you collect and return your forms in
good time as it is not possible to accept late
applications.
