WHO Covers Up Drugs?
JON TROUT
World Health Organisation offi-
cials in Geneva who produced a
report last December entitled
"Cannabis: A Health Perspective
and Research Agenda" have been
called into disrepute, following
allegations in New Scientist mag-
azine.
The N e w Scientist article c o n -
cerned the suppression of a draft
containing a comparison between
cannabis and the legal drugs alco-
hol and tobacco. The leaked d o c u -
ment concluded that the amount of
cannabis s m o k e d w o r l d - w i d e not
only harms public health less than
alcohol and tobacco, but w o u l d be
likely to continue to d o so if c o n -
sumed on the same scale as these
legal substances. N e w Scientist
claimed that the W H O had "bowed
to political pressure" in removing
the comparative analysis "at the
last minute" following intense dis-
pute between W H O officials,
cannabis experts a n d "external
advisors". The official line o n the
withdrawal was that "the reliability
and public health significance of
such comparisons are doubtful".
This was echoed by the rushed
W H O press statement, released 19
February, in defence of their posi-
tion, which stated that there was
"no attempt to hide information"
and that the decision not to include
such a comparison was "based on
scientific judgement and nothing to
do with political pressure". The
statement went o n to admit that
the b a c k g r o u n d article "A
C o m p a r a t i v e
Appraisal of the
Health a n d
P s y c h o l o g i c a l
C o n s e q u e n c e s
of A l c o h o l ,
C a n n a b i s ,
N i c o t i n e a n d
O p i a t e Use",
w h o s e c o n c l u -
sions w e r e
d r o p p e d , c o n -
tained several
c o n t r a d i c t i o n s
and conclusions
which "were not
s c i e n t i f i c a l l y
sound", sug-
gesting that
N e w Scientist
had been looking at an erroneous,
early report.
Speaking to Felix, David
Concar, author of the article and
deputy editor at N e w Scientist,
presented a different side of
events: "I a m very familiar with their
press statement" he remarked
dryly; "we knew exactly what we
were looking at. W e were not look-
ing at the w r o n g article." H e
acknowledged that it was the back-
g r o u n d paper in question, but
c l a i m e d that the w h o l e report
(Cannabis: A Health Perspective, a
Research Agenda) was to be based
on the conclusions of several back-
g r o u n d
papers, writ-
ten by
experts in
1995, a n d
that the c o m -
parison was
removed fol-
lowing the
political influ-
ence of
groups such
as the United
S t a t e s
N a t i o n a l
Institute o n
Drug A b u s e
and the
U n i t e d
N a t i o n s
Drug C o n t r o l
Both g r o u p s are
the legalisation of
cannabis and would see this c o m -
parison as ideal ammunition for
pressure groups. "They claim that
they pulled it because it was not
scientifically sound, but w e at N e w
Scientist went through the d o c u -
ment very thoroughly and w e could
see no such problem". M r Concar
International
P r o g r a m m e ,
o p p o s e d to
went on to say that it was an ongo-
ing issue and that the W H O have
not seen the last of N e w Scientist.
W h e n asked if the damaged rela-
tions w o u l d prove problematic, he
retorted: "That's journalism. W e are
here to report the facts, and what
w e say is in clear conflict with the
W H O . W e know what that docu-
ment represents."
Felix then contacted Phillippe
Stroot, the Co-ordinator of M e d i a
Relations at W H O headquarters in
Geneva, w h o forwarded all ques-
tions to Dr M o n t e i r o , one of the
authors of the cannabis report. As
Felix w a s g o i n g to press, Dr
M o n t e i r o had not c o m m e n t e d . M r
Concar did warn Felix, however, "to
expect nothing but the official line
from Geneva."
A copy of the background arti-
cle has been unearthed, and the
authors finish the paper by stating :
"There are g o o d reasons for saying
that [cannabis] w o u l d be unlikely to
seriously rival the public health risks
of alcohol and tobacco even if as
many people used cannabis as now
drink alcohol or smoke tobacco".
This certainly gives credence to
N e w Scientist's claims, but it is
unlikely that the apparently political
reason for its omission will be offi-
cially admitted in the near future.
No Butts for JCR Caterers
TONY OFORI
Smoking in the JCR and the adjacent area
between the JCR and the Senior C o m m o n R o o m
is facing a possible total ban following a recent
meeting of the Health and Safety Committee.
At the meeting, held o n 12 February, the c o m -
mittee expressed their concerns over the prac-
ticality of continuing with the existing arrange-
ment
Currently, there is a lack of a c c o m m o d a t i o n
for those w h o wish to s m o k e in the JCR so this
move will anger many that feel they are already
in an ill-catered for minority. A possible solution
lies in the proposed refurbishment of the JCR
where a properly ventilated s m o k i n g area is
provided. However this scheme which was orig-
inally supposed to be c o m p l e t e d in 1997, imay
be postponed again this year. Another possibil-
ity under consideration is the instalment of an
air-recycling machine in the corridor outside the
JCR.
IC's smokers forced to resort to desperate
The main thrust for this change seems to be
attitude of the catering staff. They dislike the
intense smell that emenates from the corridor
and the rubbish that accumulates. The
Chairman of the Health and Safety Committee,
John Foster, reiterated this saying that the cater-
ers find the environment "very unpleasant" and
"feel uncomfortable about entering the area to
carry out cleaning". Another reason for the
change is that the corridor is seen as a possible
seating area for the overflow from the JCR.
The Committee feels strongly about of the
withdrawal of this unofficial smoking area, and
there are rumours of catering staff strikes if
things continue the way they are. The college
secretary has been contacted over the affair and
if the Health and Safety C o m m i t t e e get their
way the new ban could take effect from the end
of this term.
