YOU'RE READING IC RADIO (!!)
THE IC RADIO PAGE 15
Hello Felix people, and w e l c o m e
back to the wonderful world of IC
Radio. A s I explained in m y little
introductory piece last week, I'll be
giving y o u a run d o w n of what the
station is up to, with features o n
bands we've got in session a n d
profiles of s o m e of our top DJs.
This w e e k I'm featuring James
Ratcliff, one of the stars of our
Friday dance night, a n d "one of the
most up for it people about".
The music he plays is not easily
categorised. "The roots definitely
lie in American house but also with
easy, fun, upfront tracks along the
lines of Pushca. I don't play too
hard, just accessible big party
beats." A n d his favourite tune at
the m o m e n t ? "There's o n e by
'Voices of Life' by Steve Silk Hurley,
there's the original a n t h e m m i x
that's got a wicked vocal and really
wide bassline- everyone loves it.
There's also loads of g o o d stuff
being released by Subliminal,
M o u s s e T and M a s t e r s at W o r k
that's worth checking out."
James Ratcliff started out when
he was 14, playing at his o w n par-
ties. He sees DJing as a logical pro-
gression from his love of music.
Inspired by people such as C.J
M a c i n t o s h , he has since pro-
gressed to playing in clubs ike the
Ministry of Sound, Hanover Grand,
A q u a r i u m a n d Cafe de Paris.
W o r k i n g alongside DJs such as
Judge Jules and the Ministry resi-
dent M a r k Wilkinson, he's built up
quite a following. But doesn't he
get nervous playing alongside such
big names?
"I don't get nervous," he confi-
dently assures, 'although I don't
want to make a mess." It's an atti-
tude y o u need if y o u want to suc-
ceed, especially when you're play-
ing in front of a knowledgeable fol-
lowing. "Yeah, the Limehaus
[Bedford] is really g o o d because
it's such a genuine c r o w d . " The
best gig so far? " W e d i d a gig in
North L o n d o n , at a huge S&JV1
party. W e were using a 12k rig
that's as powerful as the one at the
Ministry, in a r o o m half the size.
Everyone w a s totally into the
music: we overran by something
like four hours."
He doesn't just stick to DJing
either. Working under the n a m e of
'The Dirty Stop-outs' with partner
and manager Lee Peterson, he's
done quite a bit of studio work.
The most note worthy involvement
to date being a mix of 'Deep Day'
by Katrina Vaughn o n W o r X
Records. H e describes the process
as being "surprisingly routine at
times," with the real satisfaction
coming w h e n they catch their work
being played by other DJs...
James Ratcliff is one of the
many DJs playing it in the mix on
our Friday dance night. His w a r m
up s h o w goes out between 7 and
8 p m every week.
