ICUAFC IV v BATH IV ICUAFC I v UMDS ICURFC II v KINGS
Being the biggest g a m e any of us
had played in it is a shame to say
that all our hard work was spoiled
by one of the worst and most
biased referees ever to have offici-
ated a g a m e . Throughout the
game, he gave everything to 'his'
team, turning d o w n t w o blatant
penalty appeals and booking half
of the ICU team. H o w e v e r his
worst crime was in the last minute
when Bath scored their winner. A
long ball d o w n ICs right wing drift-
ed a yard out of play. Everyone
s t o p p e d , even the Bath striker
went to catch the ball, but the ref
waved play o n . The striker drifted
inside an unleashed a shot past the
shell-shocked IC goalkeeper. O u r
protests were waved away and
there was nothing we could d o . N o
time to score an equaliser. It was
all over. W h e n we lose to a better
team so be it, but to lose in such a
manner rips the heart out of any
team, and make y o u think just is it
worth it? Even their equaliser was
streaky. A close range shot which
the goalkeeper tipped onto his
post, rebounded onto his head
and trickled in. It should have been
funny, but no one was in the m o o d
for laughter.

Skiing
Last Saturday night saw the third
round of the King's parallel slalom
racing league. In the first round of
racing both teams managed to w i n
two out of three races. In the sec-
ond round, Imperial 1 began to
show their class and beat s o m e
highly ranked teams, only losing
one race due to a dubious official
decision resulting in disqualifica-
tion for "a third jump start".
In the head to head slalom races
for the final positions, Imperial 1
narrowly beat C a m b r i d g e , a n d
Imperial 2 triumphed against royal
Holloway 1. Imperial 1 finished in
5th place. Imperial 2 finished in
11th place, the highest k n o w n
placing ever achieved by the sec-
onds.

Gialiardo was on international duty
and Shanidze was suspended, so
Tippayawong and Knutsen were
recalled. Imperial hit the bar early
on and Foulstone went close after
a corner-kick, but Imperial general-
ly looked unsettled and U M D S
were awarded a penalty w h e n a
U M D S striker was fouled by
Psycho. The striker took the penal-
ty himself w h i c h was superbly
saved by Keane, w h o looked confi-
dent throughout the game. Psycho
was then booked for being kicked
in the eye. A strange descision
indeed from an otherwise excellent
referee. Imperial went in front
when Foulstone got his ninth of the
season with a screamer from 4 0
yards. Superb.
In the 2nd half IC dominated
with A m o and Stewart dominating
the middle of the park. Marcos,
A m o and Knutsen all had excellent
opportunities to score before top
scorer Warren Brayn cooly put IC
2-0 up at the ground where he
made his debut.
In the final IC will play the LSE.

IC 2nds go storming on to the
B U S A final with a miraculous win
over the tossers from temple.
IC set the scene by conceding first
points to Kings but then retaliated
with a storming breakthrough try by
Dave 'Nipply' Pearce.
With storming support from the
sidelines IC dominated the middle
periods of the match. Superb kick-
ing from Keith 'El Capitan' Beattie
and H u w 'Spew' Tanner was aided
by superb defence from the IC side
and periods of complete incompe-
tence by Kings.
The IC pressure had to tell and
eventually T o m Slater broke
through from inside centre to score
the second try. Duly converted by
James 'Kevin' Trude it left IC 12-5
ahead at half time.
As the referee's watch had a
flat battery, the second half went
on forever. With injurytime nev-
erending, the last 20 minutes were
an absolute nightmare for all those
involved. Although conceding a fur-
ther unconverted try, a penalty
from Trudy kept us ahead and
despite losing M a n i with a knack-
ered ankle, w e maintained our cool
to record an outstanding victory.

ICU Snooker Club in
Massive Pot Shock
Last weekend saw the annual BUSA
snooker tournament kick off in
Southampton and Imperial college
were there in force. The 'B' team
event produced Imperial's best ever
result, coming home with six bronze
medals: one in the individual and
five in the team competition. The
team soared through the group
stages coming top of both and mov-
ing comfortably into the semi-final,
meeting up against Warwick. The ini-
tial stages looked promising thanks
to some stunning snooker, especial-
ly by Ketal w h o gave Imperial an
early advantage moving to 5-3 with
two to play. Warwick bucked the
earlier trend and came back to five
all to force a tiebreak. Ketal was
nominated to play a single frame.
Despite a Stirling effort we went
down fighting. In the singles knock-
out tournament, Ketal met Greg in
the first round and Russell in the
quarters to get through to the semi
final.
Imperial 'A' team (defending cup
champs) played excellently to reach
quarter finals against UEA but lost six
of the first eight frames. All attention
focused on the blue ribbon event,
the 'A' team individuals. The play on
Friday and Saturday resulted in only
Robi and John left in the quarter
finals. Sadly Robi was knocked out in
the last 16. John came through some
nail bitingly close frames to meet
Exeter's star player in the final to be
contested over 5 frames. At fifty-one
ahead you would expect to win a
frame but the might of his opponent
triumphed.
