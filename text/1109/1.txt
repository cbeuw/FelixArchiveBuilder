DAVID ROBERTS
Dave Hellard, A d a m Cherrington,
Dave W h a r t o n and Ed Sexton
emerged triumphant as the elec-
tions for next year's Union
sabbatical officers reached
their c o n c l u s i o n o n
Wednesday. The result was
greeted with a mixed reaction
- cheers from the assembled
crowd interspersed with cries
of " O h my G o d , the Union's
being run by two barmen and
a steward" from one senior
union figure.
Unusually, the St Mary's •
block vote, ordinarily the r j L
decisive factor in sabbatical
elections, failed to pick the
winners, with both Dave
W h a r t o n (Deputy President
F&S elect) and Dave Hellard
(incoming President) over-
c o m i n g pressure for a N e w
Election from Mary's, to win
on the first re-allocation of
votes. Both victors carried
their first round leads to suc-
cess, although Dave Hellard was
aided by 146 second preferences
from St M a r y ' s , installing him as
President for 1998-99, by 6 5 0
votes to 400.
M e a n w h i l e , Ed Sexton and
A d a m Cherrington both secured
relatively easy victories (as Felix
Editor and Deputy President C & S
respectively), with totals represent-
ing over 65. Messers Sexton and
Cherrington were also notable for
gaining victories on every one of
the twelve polling stations.
All four of the victors proved
nigh on incomprehensible by the
time the result was
announced, although they
all m a n a g e d to confirm
that they were "Very, very
happy". Having accepted
that "I'm t o o drunk to
make a comment", Dave
Hellard then went on to
attempt to sack all the bar
M staff, before being whisked
Jp away for celebratory drinks
by his future DPs.
C o m m e n t i n g on the
winners Rob Clark, incum-
bent D P F&S observed "all
the candidates are inexpe-
rienced, but a month is a
long time for a handover".
H o w e v e r , Andy Heeps,
ICU President and
Returning Officer, c o u n -
tered that "a lot of people
might be worried about
nexperience, but there's
no difference between the situation
n o w and that w h e n 1 was elected in
November".
Mary's RAG Lead the Way
KENT YIP
St Mary's Hospital Rag Appeal
has raised an enormous £ 4 0 , 2 0 0
in aid of the Leukaemia Research
Fund in this year's rag week.
£ 2 4 , 1 0 4 w a s collected during
Thursday's Circle Line Pub Crawl
alone, breaking last year's record of
£ 1 9 , 0 0 0 . Both candidates running
for Imperial College Union
President were seen a m o n g the
exuberant c r o w d .
Rag activities were not confined
within the medical s c h o o l -
A m s t e r d a m was chosen as the des-
tination for this year's Rag Dash,
the traditional cannon fodder event
which took place three weeks ago.
The exotic nature of the Dutch cap-
ital was so popular a m o n g the
medics that all one hundred places
available on the tour were taken.
The sheer number of Rag Dashers,
not to mention the amount of drink
c o n s u m e d on the way, made it one
of the most successful dashes in
living memory.
Rag Week got off to a g o o d
start with the Breakfast Party
Collection: M e d i c s dressed in their
green surgical gowns and white
coat, the unofficial uniform for the
week, trooped d o w n to Waterloo,
Paddington, a n d Kings Cross
Railway Stations to 'raid' the early
m o r n i n g rush hour c o m m u t e r s ,
yielding £ 3 , 6 7 2 .
For the braver medics, abseiling
d o w n the wall of the m e d i c a l
school was next on the agenda.
Besides providing entertainment to
an on-looking c r o w d , which con-
sisted of patients from the hospital,
money was also raised for the g o o d
cause. The popularity of the event
was evident; not only were the bold
ones sponsored five pounds for
each attempt, but the wait at one
point was almost an hour long.
Later on in the week, white
coats and surgical greens were
exchanged for Armani Suits and
rowing gear - the former for min-
gling with the city slickers and the
latter for the sponsored twelve
hour row at Trafalgar Square.
Generous donations from the pub-
lic, as well as sponsorship, brought
in £ 1 , 0 0 0 .
Light entertainment was organ-
ised in the evenings, including a
Roman Night o n Tuesday, where
slaves were auctioned. The highest
bid came from M a r c u s W o o d , a
final year clinical student, w h o paid
£ 1 1 0 for the 'Martini Girls'. Also
held on the same night was the
drinking c o m p e t i t i o n Centurion
Club - participants had to d o w n
100 double shots of beer within
100 minutes. Bands Night on
W e d n e s d a y saw an attendance of
200. Having survived the carnage
of post Circle Line Bop, G l a d y s
was transformed into a jazz club on
Friday evening; £ 2 , 0 0 0 was raised
through ticket sales.
