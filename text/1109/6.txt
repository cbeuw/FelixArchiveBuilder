COLUMNS 27 February 1998
As I have been a bit slow
off the mark this week,
and a m writing this o n
Wednesday morning, I can c o m -
ment on the Election results. In the
words of veteran political c o m -
mentator, Bruce Forsyth, 'didn't
they d o well.' It s e e m s that w e
have achieved a very favourable
outcome- no N e w Election victo-
ries, no hacks and a M a r y ' s block
vote that proved to be as effective
as a chocolate teapot. O f course, I
attribute the anti-hack vote to m y
last column, so 1 shall be expecting
a pint off each of the Daves in the
fullness of time. S o m e new blood
is exactly what is needed to shake
things up. This should not be seen
as an attack o n the incumbents,
but n o w the merger has hap-
pened, the new thinking required
is unlikely to be provided by peo-
ple nurtured in the ways of o l d .
This s o u n d s like a call for a
Thatcherite reforming zeal- what a
g o o d idea, as she o n c e s a i d .
Congratulation also to A d a m
Cherrington, also from outside the
Union fold, though with s o m e use-
ful abilities in dealing with sports
clubs. His ability to maintain a ver-
tical stance while consuming alco-
hol has been called into question,
but is being w o r k e d o n . . .
Obviously, as a humble scribe, the
post of Felix Editor is of the great-
est interest to me, so it was g o o d
to see Ed Sexton triumph. Though
both candidates were sound, Alok
Jha's wish to turn
Felix into a maga-
zine sent a shiver
d o w n m y spine.
O l d lags w h o
have been here
longer than is
healthy will
r e m e m b e r the
last time this was
d o w n in 1994
under the stew-
ardship of Beccy
Land. That must
never be allowed
to happen again. Felix is, and must
remain, a newspaper, which is
what Ed has planned for next year.
Any chance of a job, guv, in what
will be my final year?

on
that I hadn't paid them a visit for a
while, so last M o n d a y I donned
the hard hat and ventured onto the
B M S site (thanks again to Phil
Hilton and Ollie Clarke). Since the
place is due to be handed over to
College on 13th April, now seems
a g o o d time to see what the state
of play is. Miraculously, it is only
two w e e k s
behind schedule
and still on bud-
get, a first for
Imperial College.
M y biggest c o n -
cern remains
that it will be lost
on the medics,
who will fail to
appreciate such
a fine building.
SUf That said, some
^ j of the r o o m s
have been
designed to take straw on the
floors (only joking, folks!).
Surprisingly, there are two huge
offices for "Students' Unions".
Does this mean one for M a r y ' s and
one for the R C S U ? D o either
deserve one? The finished atrium
will look fantastic, consisting of
maple panelling and polished con-
crete, which surprisingly will work
well. The most interesting design
feature, however, is not the roof or
the atrium itself, but the ground
floor toilets. For reasons best
known to Sir N o r m a n Foster, he
has taken his inspiration for these
facilities from Southside, using
very, very similar black granite.
This has the potential to confuse
inebriated medics and biologists
mightily in lectures after a heavy
session, though s o m e would argue
this will happen irrespective of the
sanitaryware. All in all, it's looking
very g o o d , and I await my invita-
tion to the official opening.
For a College so steeped in
apathy, it is fantastic to see that
the Summer Ball has got off the
ground. This is precisely the sort of
event that IC needs to s h o w to the
country that w e are a class act,
both academically and socially. For
my small part, I shall be shame-
lessly plugging it here form now to
the event, so buy those tickets, be
you staff, student or idle layabout.
This Sunday, 1 M a r c h , the
Countryside M a r c h will take place in
Hyde Park. Press coverage of this
event has been divided, on left-
wing/right-wing lines, with left-wing
papers suggesting that it is being
organised by landowners and farm-
ers w h o are doing quite nicely and
are in no position to ask for more.
Other papers suggest that the prob-
lems of rural areas are more serious
than the townies would realise and
maybe it is time to take action.
Approximately 80% of the p o p -
ulation live in built-up areas, giving a
similar make-up in the House of
C o m m o n s , with the national
press/TV consisting almost entirely
of London-based journalists (papers
often have North of England corre-
spondents in the same way that
they have a German or US corre-
spondent.) So perhaps it is under-
standable that country folk are dis-
enchanted with the way things are
running. The march, which may look
similar to the rally held recently in
support of fox-hunting, c o m e s at a
time of change in the countryside.
EU members are planning to dis-
mantle s o m e of the C o m m o n
Agricultural Policy so that taxes and
f o o d prices can be l o w e r e d .
Remember the C A P was designed
with the express intention of not
having market forces invade agricul-
tural production, with the fairly rea-
sonable defence being that there
have been plenty of riots and wars
in the past and the EU's main pur-
pose is to rid Europe of these prob-
lems in perpetuity. The Government
is pointedly not applying to the
C o m m i s s i o n for c o m p e n s a t i o n
British farmers are entitled to
(under EU law) due to the apprecia-
tion of the p o u n d .
Other problems seem to await
our country friends: the last
Conservative Government carefully
delayed a nasty decision on the
and renovation costs before build-
ing on brownfield sites at all. But
the Council for the Protection of
Rural England are up in arms any-
way, saying that Prescott will not
keep his w o r d on the issue. They
have some justification - one of his
first actions as Environment
Minister was to authorise the build-
ing of 10,000 new homes near
Stevenage, and then telling West
Sussex to increase to 50,700 the
Hamish Common
Westminster
Eye
potential explosion in housing
requirements and the lack of space
to build them, leaving their succes-
sors the choice of overcrowding
and impossibly high house prices or
building on greenfield sites. John
Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister
and Environment Minister, has
decided that 60% of all new homes
must be built on 'brownfield' sites -
renovated urban land. This is not
pleasant for the building industry
who are aware that housing estates
with a nice view of the countryside
sell rather better than those with a
nice view of other buildings, and
also have to pay any contamination
number of new homes it must
accommodate (West Sussex is now
seeking a judicial review).
The other issue that affects the
countryside also divides it - the
issue of the 'right to roam', unfet-
tered access to vast tracts of land,
irrespective of w h o it is o w n e d by.
This is one of the oldest issues for
Labour, with memories of struggles
against the landowners w h o also
owned the factories and mines they
worked at. Labour made a promise
in its election manifesto that it
would introduce the right to roam,
c o m p l e t e d unfinished business
from the 1949 National Parks and
A c c e s s to the Countryside Act,
which a Labour Government intro-
duced, making the Peak District the
first National Park and reinforcing
the laws on footpaths. It decided
then against the right to roam, leav-
ing it instead to landowners them-
selves, with the local authorities
watching over them and if neces-
sary enforcing the law. M a n y peo-
ple feel this has not worked, with
vast tracts of land still inaccessible
to the public. However, it appears
that that the Country Landowners'
Association has convinced Downing
Street to backtrack on the right to
roam policy, and instead maintain
the voluntary access agreements,
implemented (or not, as the case
may be) today. This will be an inter-
esting choice for Downing Street to
make.
It is worrying the Government
s e e m bent o n discrediting the
Countryside Rally by arguing that it
is run by landowners and farmers,
and that its view are not represen-
tative of the countryside communi-
ty. That is the standard political pre-
amble to completely ignore their
demands. Despite the stories that
s o m e bosses have forced their
employees to attend the rally (other
bosses have banned their staff from
attending), if they get as many peo-
ple out as they promise to, then it
will be a demonstration of solidarity
that the Government would be wise
not to ignore.
