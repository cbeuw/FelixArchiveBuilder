W h o o p s ! A s I'm sure you'll all have noticed
there was a bit of an error in last week's special
- we've already done carrot cake. It should
instead have been that old favourite Turnip
Surprise. N o bother, just replace the w o r d car-
rot with turnip everywhere and Baldrick's your
uncle.
This week I'm doing a serious meal for seri-
ously hungry people. Both the dishes are typi-
cally French and go d o w n very well with a few
bottles of red.
Carbonade de Boeuf
*" I kg beef, shin is best, cut into squares
—5x5x2 c m
2 0 0 g s m o k e d pork belly, diced
"~ 500 g c h o p p e d onion
*" 1 litre cheapo lager
»• 2 tbl flour
3 cloves of garlic, crushed
Heat up a fair amount of oil in a (big) pan
and fry the meat until well brown as usual.
When it's nearly done a d d the pork belly and fry
gently for around 10 minutes so that it renders
its fat (i.e. the fat melts and seeps out). Don't
forget to add a large pinch of pepper to season
everything.
Take the meat out, drain well keeping as
much fat in the pan as possible and put into a
low oven to keep it w a r m .
N o w delicately sprinkle the flour into the
pan and fry gently until it starts to turn brown.
Pour in 3
A I of the beer, stir well and have a g o o d
sniff while you bring the liquid up to the boil.
Put this roux to one side.
Finally, fry the onion gently until it turns
translucent and slightly brownish on the edges.
Right, that's all the heavy stuff out of the way
and n o w it's time to put everything together.
In a large solid pan, place first a layer of beef

picture of some Colorado beetles ate it.
and pork then a layer of onion and repeat until
there is none left. A d d a bouquet garni. (This
consists of a stick of celery, some sprigs of
thyme and a few stray ends of parsley all
w r a p p e d up in the green bit of a leek and tied
up nicely with a piece of string, bow-tied if
wanted.) Also a d d the garlic, a couple of tbis of
sugar and a pinch of nutmeg. Pour the beer roux
in. If there isn't enough liquid to cover every-
thing add the remaining 'A I beer until there is.
Cover the pan and put o n a low heat for at
least 2 hours. The longer it cooks the better.
Cratin Dauphinois
1 kg potatoes
®- 1 '/i pt milk
"~ 2-3 cloves of garlic, crushed
Peel the potatoes and slice them up as fine-
ly as you possibly can. The ideal situation is for
them to be trahslucent. This will take a lot of
time and effort and y o u will get bored but hey,
this is serious cooking we're talking about.
O n c e that is done, give t h e m a rinse in cold
water and drain well. This gets rid of some of
the starch and stops this dish getting too
stodgy.
Slowly heat up the milk, season it with a
large pinch of salt, s o m e pepper and a bit of
nutmeg. Get your favourite oven dish (a thick
ceramic one is a bonus but not necessary), oil it
lightly and smear the crushed garlic cloves all
over the sides and bottom.
Place the sliced potatoes in the dish and pat
them around until it looks flat and even. Pour
the milk over, put a few knobs of butter on the
top and slide into the oven, gas mark 4/5, 180-
190°C. The gratin needs to roast for at least an
hour, preferably two.
THOUGHT FOR THE DAY:
Cannabis: to smoke or not to smoke...
C
annabis is a substance that is
definitely in the public eye at
the moment, with the alleged
cover-up of the W o r l d H e a l t h
Organisation report concerning its
effects o n health in comparison to
alcohol and tobacco, and a recent
suggestion from the British M e d i c a l
Authority that the law should be
relaxed in cases where marijuana is
used medicinally. There is no place
where these issues are contested
more strongly than inside College
itself, and with the large volume of
busts and tribunals which make
Andy H e e p s ' job that little bit hard-
er, it seems a very ripe time to
address the issue.
M o s t of the effects of cannabis
seem to involve "saying hello to
Mr. Gravity", falling over, "feeling
well mellow, m a n " , giggling, eating
quantities of food that w o u l d give
Weight Watchers a hysterical fit,
and forgetting what it was that...
e r m . . . o h . The bad effects of
cannabis are such a cliche that I a m
sure everyone aged fifteen and up
knows them by heart: short-term
m e m o r y loss, destruction of con-
centration, antimotivational syn-
drome, cancer... However, the old
wacky baccy's popularity is defi-
nitely high at the m o m e n t .
Remember all that fuss about peo-
ple rolling joints in BBC2's "This
Life"? To portray smoking in such
an off-hand and socially acceptable
way resulted in many complaints,
but seldom has a drama captured
the reality of the 90's toking phe-
n o m e n o n so well.
I never came into contact with
drugs of any form until I was thor-
oughly corrupted by c o m i n g to IC.
W h e n a certain y o u n g individual
strolled into my r o o m in hall in the
middle of my first term last year
with the promise of "a m e g a -
bostin' reefer", I immediately
sprang out of my self-contempla-
tive apathy to go to see what all the
fuss was about. I was presented
with an evil-smelling hunk of brown
muddy mulch, and I found myself
thinking straight away how many
people had had it up their rectal
tract for it to get where it was now.
1 w a s interested, but not
enough to try it; four people disap-
peared up to someone's r o o m ,
becoming denizens of a depraved
druggy den, and I sat and watched
them.
Well, statistically, I imagine a
fair proportion of you lot know
what transpired; Orbital, Kettle
Chips, improvised smoking equip-
ment, long and eloquent tirades
about methods of "skinning up",
detailing the process with c o n -
structional accuracy that would put
any contractor to shame.
It is not my place to pass judge-
ment on d o p e , even if I felt c o m -
pelled to. What 1 saw was a lot of
p e o p l e enjoying themselves.
Perhaps it was the thick brown
haze floating menacingly several
feet below the ceiling, or alterna-
tively the spectacle of users sitting
cross-legged on the floor, unable to
get up, but I had a very pleasant
evening as well. There can be no
doubt that M a r y Jane has a strong
allure, and will undoubtedly be
used or misused for many genera-
tions hence, but I believe that the
issue of damage to those w h o
indulge will probably always be in
contention, and, I reckon, rightly
so.
