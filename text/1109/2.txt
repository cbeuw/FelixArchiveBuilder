London Colleges Red Card for Football
Snub NUS Strike
ANDREW OFORI
The University of London will be
conspicuous by its absence dur-
ing the NUS 'shut-down' on 4
March. The event c o m e s as the
NUS campaign against tuition fees
is reaching its culmination, with
current efforts being concentrated
on opposition to the Teaching and
Higher Education Bill, which will
pave the way for the introduction
of fees.
The N U S 'shut-down' event has
received nation-wide backing with
130 Further and Higher Education
institutes closing d o w n for the day.
Students are being encouraged to
go to their student unions rather
than attend academic sessions.
Having gained support from the
Association of University Teachers
and a significant number of lectur-
ers, the N U S have stressed that no
students should be academically
disadvantaged as a result of the
strike action.
L o n d o n students have
expressed the depth of their feeling
against tuition fees in the past with
events such as the H y d e Park
d e m o n s t r a t i o n s last N o v e m b e r
(Felix 1097 and 1100), but on 4
M a r c h Goldsmiths College will be
the sole University of London par-
ticipant, and will only be giving par-
tial support. The N U S are disap-
pointed with London's response;
one union representative warned
"not supporting something like this
is a big mistake". A former London
student w h o is currently a member
of the parliamentary division of the
N U S emphasised the "onus is on
the choice of the student" and
went o n to explain "this isn't a new
p h e n o m e n o n for this campaign", as
London colleges regularly show a
lack of support at these type of
events. H e attributed this to a sig-
nificant number of c o m m u t e r s
making up the student population,
consequently reducing the impor-
tance of the unions in student life.
H o w e v e r , ICU president A n d y
Heeps was more forthright in his
reasoning for not taking part,
asserting "It's a case of shutting the
stable door w h e n the horse is
halfway d o w n the field".
Fourths
JULIA HARRIES
The Imperial College Union
Football Club are to face a Union
Disciplinary Committee next
week, after the Fourth team
caused trouble in Bath Union last
Wednesday.
Having lost their B U S A game,
the team went to the bar to drown
their sorrows. A c c o r d i n g to Jo
Humphrey, Assistant Bar Manager
at Bath Union, they behaved in a
"drunken, rowdy manner", jumping
on tables, shouting and swearing.
W h e n asked to calm d o w n by the
Bar Supervisor they refused, and so
were cautioned by Sean Bentley,
the Assistant Bar Manager on duty
at the time, w h o informed them
that they would not be served fur-
ther at the bar. The team appeared
to c a l m d o w n , but w h e n M r
Bentley's back was turned, they
shouted and swore at him. M r
Bentley then obtained the help of
the Bath Sports President, Sarah
M i l n e , in order to make t h e m
leave. At this point the students
became even more abusive; one IC
student o n leaving was heard to
protest "What kind of fucking union
is this?" Bath Union has contacted
Imperial College Union to inform
t h e m of the trouble, a n d has
advised ICU not to let the team
into its bars. M r Bentley comment-
ed that" N o respect was shown for
the bar, the staff or the University."
This incident is the latest in a
line of similar occurrences. Andy
Heeps, 1CU President, decided to
bring the Fourth team before a
Union Disciplinary Committee, as
he has been very lenient on previ-
ous occasions, a fact acknowl-
edged by Donal Keene, the Football
Club Captain. M r Heeps observed
"It's getting a little tedious.
However, I'm sure the Disciplinary
Committee will make a decision." It
s e e m s unlikely that the Fourth
team will be invited back to Bath,
with M s H u m p h r e y remarking "they
won't be very w e l c o m e here."
Waterstone's Fire 'Warning Shot'
DAVID ROBERTS
Fears are growing that
Waterstone's, who last year took
over from the Union as sole
bookshop on campus, may have
greater visions for their retail
empire. Speaking at the first meet-
ing of the B o o k s t o r e Users
C o m m i t t e e last week, Rachel
Dickinson, the manager of the
campus branch, outlined her desire
to stock cards and stationery in
addition to science texts and a
wide range of fiction.
Despite the fact that the con-
tract for the site explicitly states
"The sale of other magazines,
newspapers, stationery, food....will
not be permitted", M s Dickinson
explained that "This is something I,
personally, w o u l d really like to see
happen". A s k e d if expansion plans
were connected to rumours that
the campus branch was at present
30% under budget, she admitted
"Yes, w e are having p r o b l e m s ,
although that's not something I'd
really like to see appear in Felix".
A n d y H e e p s , IC Union
President and sole student repre-
sentative o n the Users Committee,
objected very strongly to any pro-
posals to expand sales to cover
tionery and so forth while the
Union Shop's still there".
Citing problems with opening
hours and sub-branches of
Waterstone's on the Charing Cross
and Hammersmith campuses, M r
stationery "Waterstone's k n o w
that's where w e get our money
from and they can sod off". M s
Dickinson did accept that at pre-
sent expansion plans were unlikely
as "We can't go selling cards, sta-
Heeps observed "We don't believe
that they are delivering on certain
promises". For example, the con-
tract states that the hours of open-
ing at South Ken should be "9am to
6pm, M o n d a y to Friday... these are
m i n i m u m times of opening", which
the present shop fails to d o . Worse
still, the H a m m e r s m i t h shop has
been closed o n every occasion on
which Union staff have visited the
site. Whilst sales of paper and sta-
tionery are prohibited at South Ken,
they are allowed at Hammersmith.
However, a rapid spot check on
demonstrated prices to be between
20 and 30% higher than at the ICU
Shop.
S p e a k i n g o n behalf of the
Union, M r Heeps a d d e d "The prob-
lems which w e raised when tender-
ing for the bookshop are now start-
ing to rear their heads". However,
the President was confident that
College w o u l d turn d o w n
Waterstone's request, viewing the
issue more as "a warning shot", to
which the Union should respond
"very firmly no".
