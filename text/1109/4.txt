Letters to Felix...
LET'S HAVE A
G O O D M O A N
Dear Felix,
The other week I w a s feeling a
bit d o w n o n the world s o 1 d e c i d e d
to get away for a week with a mate
of mine at Sheffield U n i a n d w e
had a little tour round the country
to visit a few mates. W e visited
quite a number of Unions in the
week a n d most were very g o o d -
Sheffield w a s absolutely fantastic.
This Friday I c a m e back to the
g o o d o l d ICU. I couldn't believe
how shabby it s e e m e d c o m p a r e d
to all the other unions in the c o u n -
try I'd been to. A n d t o a d d insult to
injury they charge y o u t o get into
the d a m n place. What really took
the biscuit w a s having sat d o w n in
the Chill O u t r o o m with a load of
mates (where w e h a d a table a n d
all had seats) 1 needed t o n i p
downstairs to the toilet. G o i n g out
I noticed a queue so I said o n the
guy o n the door that I w a s just
going downstairs quickly c o u l d he
let m e back in - 'Yeah n o problem",
was the reponse. C o m i n g back
upstairs I tried to return t o m y
beer, seat a n d mates only t o find
the same lad telling m e I was g o i n g
to have t o queue. What sort of
idiocy is this? I c a n understand fire
regulations meaning there has t o
be limited numbers in the r o o m but
surely if you've g o t a chair and y o u
have a w o r d with the staff o n the
door before leaving they could let
you back in. There s e e m s t o be no
c o m m o n sense here.
All this has really riled m e -
especially w h e n I'm regretting m y
decision t o c o m e to Imperial in the
first place (I took a year out before
coming here a n d could easily have
kept o n working instead of taking
my degree - I wish I had). The
question at the m o m e n t I'm asking
myself is even if I pass m y exams in
the s u m m e r d o I really want t o
return to this money-grabbing insti-
tution which s e e m s t o remove all
a c a d e m i c a m b i t i o n a n d breed
sheer apathy.
Sorry about all that - rant over.
Cheers,
Andy Hallas ( M e c h Eng I)
WORDS O F
WISDOM
Dear Jeremy,
It's not often that I write a let-
ter t o Felix, mainly because I spend
most of m y life in the office as
Editor Without Portfolio anyway,
but I'm afraid that I can't let Simon
Baker (and others) criticisms of ICU
go unanswered.
Firstly, to answer the argument
that there are t o o many commit-
tees in ICU. This must be the first
time I have ever seen anyone c o m -
plain that t o o many people were
taking an interest in running the
Union; the truth is that there is
always r o o m for more help, and as
Chair of Publications Board I know
that 1 wouldn't mind a hand some-
times. I agree that at first sight
there w o u l d s e e m t o be a large
number, but bear in mind that
w h e n trying t o deal with over 2 5 0
clubs a n d societies a n d serve the
needs of around 10,000 students
one necessarily has s o m e c o m -
plexity. O f course the C C U struc-
ture d o e s confuse the matter
somewhat, but I'll c o m e back t o
t h e m later.
Shin Yi Jeng a n d his Anglo-
German society, I sympathise that
he w a s needlessly a n d irritatingly
juggled between t w o committees
for months. In the future I w o u l d
suggest that w h e n it is not obvious
w h i c h Clubs a n d Society
C o m m i t t e e should take responsi-
bility for a n e w club, that the mat-
ter be referred t o the D e p u t y
President (Clubs &. Societies) or
even taken the I C U Executive
C o m m i t t e e . It is a shame that nei-
ther S C C nor O S C s a w fit to take
this action.
G e t t i n g o n t o the issue of
C C U s , I used to be of the opinion
that they were a self-serving worth-
less historical anomaly. However,
having seen what a reformed, for-
ward looking a well-run C C U can
d o (taking ICSMSU a n d to a lesser
extent, R S M U , as shining exam-
ples) I n o w feel that C C U s are vital
to the well-being of ICU as a whole,
for the following reasons;
- They preserve the heritage and
tradition of the disparate parts of

college. This provides a much-need-
ed sense of identity to students w h o
would otherwise struggle to identify
with ICU (which is, let's face it, a lit-
tle bland, tradition-wise).
- They provide an extra layer
where students c a n b e c o m e
involved in clubs and societies, a n d
also experience politics (yes, even
committees). In a college where
the level of apathy is constantly
bemoaned, it is surely a g o o d idea
to give students an opportunity t o
get involved wherever possible.
Finally, what d o y o u propose t o
replace them with? I agree with
Simon that s o m e of them should
concentrate o n their essential roles
of A c a d e m i c Affairs a n d Welfare,
and waste less effort o n in-fighting
and bitching about Felix, but the
C C U s are an integral part of IC.
Remove them, a n d y o u might as
well change the name t o 'Metric
College'.
Cheers,
M a r k Baker
Publications Board Chair &. Felix
Editor Without Portfolio.
SLEEPING DOGS...
This letter should have appeared
last week, but we mislayed it.
Apologies.
Dear Editor,
Thank G o d someone has been
brave enough to draw attention t o
the rudest w o m a n at the University
in the accommodation office. M y
misfortune w a s to want t o live at
clayponds, a n d the patronising
treatment that I received from her
was unbelievable ! Not only did I get
shouted at, but as m y English w a s
then not t o o g o o d she spoke in a
very slow sarcastic voice t o m e , like
I was a child! W h y does the college
have such a person dealing with vul-
nerable students? There must have
been other complaints over the
years and I have spoken to at least
ten others w h o have suffered in a
similar way H o w can y o u complain
when if you d o y o u won't get any
accommodation? W e are intimidat-
ed by her, it is totally unfair. Where
are y o u Rector? Sack the bulldog,
and please get a spaniel!
I daren't give m y name as I
expect they won't d o anything and I
may need to stay in clayponds again
unfortunately. Well done, anyway!
