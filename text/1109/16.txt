Unfortunately events don't g o to

fighting for their freedom at a time
when the majority of blacks in the
country were slaves.
The Africans are supported by

real estate attorney Roger Baldwin
(McConaughey) w h o initially likens
his clients to livestock. However,
the obstacle to justice is not the
judge or jury, w h o s e e m to
sympathise with the Africans, but
the pro-slavery President Martin
Van Buren (Hawthorne) w h o s e
main interest lies in securing a
second term in office and avoiding
civil war. His challenge is m e t by
the former president John Quincy
A d a m s (Hopkins) w h o eventually
agrees to support the Africans in
their bid for freedom.
Previous Spielberg films have
been more c o n c e r n e d with the
delivery of their sensational
aspects rather than attempting to
induce empathetic understanding
from the audience. With Amistad,
this is not the case as powerful
emotions are o n view throughout,
mainly emanating from the suffer-
ing Africans. W e are given the

Hopkins' portrayal of the o l d
and a b s e n t - m i n d e d former
president is effective but the star of
this film is H o u n s o u as the slave's
leader, whose capability of reflect-
ing almost every e m o t i o n with
s u p r e m e authenticity is s i m p l y
inspirational. T h e direction is
relaxed a n d well p a c e d with
Spielberg opting to leave more to
the imagination he d i d in
Schindler's List. C o u p l e d with
fantastic cinematography, Amistad
is an excellent piece of film-making
and the most artistic film Spielberg
has ever directed. From a director
renowned for his crowd-pleasers,
this must rank as o n e of his least
commercial. Y o u probably w o n ' t

people to watch it in an attempt to
better themselves. N o . W a t c h it

press release of La Maman et la Putain. I'm not
sure what that says about the competition, but
the film w a s also richly rewarded at Cannes at the
time. This re-issue boasts " c o r r e c t e d " subtitles,
although this reviewer found them rather American-
biased.
But this is a trifling complaint: the main problem
with the film is its length of over 3'/z hrs. In that length

Initially at least, the film is entertaining enough;
Parisian cafe society and a bunch of hippies are fertile
territory a n d the script is witty a n d light-hearted.
Unfortunately, the pretentious attitude that starts off
being ridiculed becomes the foundation for the rest of
the story. The situation becomes increasingly incredi-
ble until it reaches almost farcical proportions.
It is tastefully shot in black and white although the
deafening background noises a n d frankly mediocre
delivery give the overall impression of a lack of pro-

given as long as 4 hours, it still cannot deal with all of
the issues it attempts to cover. D Tom lllingworth
