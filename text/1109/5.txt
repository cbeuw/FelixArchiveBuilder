TYPINH ERRIRS
1 have certainly learnt my lesson of
allegiance to the mighty w o r d
processor, and learnt it well. I must
assume that my crummy and out-
dated handwriting is to blame for a
not insignificant error in your inter-
pretation of my letter, published
Febtuary 20. To my knowledge,
'Plots' is not responsible for a great
deal of classical philosophical
thought, though I may be proved
wrong. The chap I was in fact after
was Plato. I shall say no more than
that.

looks like 'Plots' to me. Who's
this Plato guy, anyway? Ed
MOANING MINNIE
Referring to the end of Milen's "Tha
Bomb" in last week's Felix: I think his
friend w h o was in IC Radio may
have misheard. It is the general
opinion of the entire college that his
regular item in Felix is more of a
source of hilarity at his unfortunate
breadth of vocabulary, rather than
any serious look at the current
music around. If he would like to
take some advice - read a dictionary
and do not write in Felix. If you
(referring to all readers) enjoy REAL
music then listen to IC Radio some-
time. You will discover that it is
rather g o o d .
M u c h appreciated,
>From the people who C A N
read and write.
Dave Edwards
What on earth are you trying to
achieve with this ill-thought out
letter, Dave? It seems especially
churlish to slag off the Felix music
pages when we have just gone to
the effort of organising a whole
page for IC Radio (Page 15).
Besides, most IC students C A N ' T
listen to IC Radio, but they C A N all
read Felix. Ed

PEACE A N D
DRUGS, M A N
Whether or not the World Health
Organisation b o w e d to direct gov-
ernment pressure w h e n it sup-
pressed parts of its report showing
cannabis to be a largely
benign substance, there
is no doubt that the
government w a n t e d
them to keep schtum.
However, this is not
because they are evil
conspirators but some-
thing much more pro-
saic - fear of the
unknown. Legalising or
d e c r i m i n a l i s i n g
cannabis is felt to be
the political equivalent of jumping
off a cliff on the off-chance of hit-
ting a trampoline. Whatever the
arguments and debates are flying
around, the truth is that no-one
really k n o w s what the conse-
quences of such a move would be.
The problem is that those cam-
paigning for the status quo, and
virtually all of the people w h o have

the power to make changes, are
totally ignorant of what cannabis
use is actually like. This means that
they are forced to rely o n the tradi-
tional arguments - 'cannabis is bad
for y o u ' and 'cannabis leads to
hard drugs'. Full marks to the New
Scientist for blowing both of these
myths right out of the
water with their report
last week
( m a r i j u a n a , n e w s c i e n -
tist.com).
I think that this
argument is being
a p p r o a c h e d back to
front. The question isn't
so m u c h 'Should
cannabis be legalised?'
as 'Why is it banned in
the first place?' The fact
is that the drug was initially prohib-
ited for totally spurious reasons,
and the ban has endured on the
strength of arguments that have
now proved false. Bearing in mind
the results of the latest studies,
there isn't a single decent reason
why a well-informed adult should-
n't be able to buy and enjoy the
drug in peace.
