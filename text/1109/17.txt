SOPHIE'S SCANDAL
Virginia Blackburn
S
ophie Brackenbury, w e l c o m -
ing agent a n d telephone
intermediary for v a n
Trocken and C o . , spends most of
her time dreaming of being a shin- j
ing light in whatever world her i
imagination takes her. S u d d e n j
jolts back to reality are frequent
and are s u p p o s e d t o provide
some gentle humour. However,
after a while, the style b e c o m e s
obvious a n d the resulting door-
bell/telephone/knock c o m e s as
too much of a predictable end t o
Sophie's latest reverie.
The real humour c o m e s from
the manic web-like plot. Sophie
finds herself a m i d chaos and c o n -
fusion. H e r tyrannical boss, M r .
van Trocken, is more irrit
able than usual. His d o w n t r o d -
den wife is unnervingly at ease,
which is more than c a n be said
about her husband's mistresses.
Sophie's shady businessman of a
boyfriend, Martin, is turning up at
her office while everyone else is
looking for him. Her best friend and
work colleague of Martin, Penny,
has just turned lesbian in what is a
long line of attempts t o shock her
parents. Penny's girlfriend,
Charlotte, has a secret about

FRIDAY!
M a r t i n a n d Penny's brother,
Michael, is interested in Sophie.
However, Sophie is sure that the
last time they met, Martin was a
nerd. O n t o p of this there's a
string of alliterative ex-boyfriends:
Desparate Dan, W e i r d o Will a n d
T o m m y (Tiffany) the Trannie.
Sophie's Scandal is built o n a
diet of frenzied sensationalism. Its
location is familiar, as she lives
just off High Street Kensington
and the offices are situated o n
Gloucester Road. Its pace is quick
but it is definitely a girly novel,
written in a gossip-like style.
Essentially it is a tale of tense
encouters, takeovers and tangled
relationships. It's probably best
read by w o m e n o n long journeys
to while away the hours. I'd prefer
Sophie's World.

Bowling club think. In a nutshell
the story is a parody of the

brought out. The comedy Is
mainly ironic with misunder-
