TREADING THE BOARDS
DUET FOR ONE
THEATRE 27 February 1998
New End Theatre
A
t first y o u feel a little bit
embarrassed. The scene is
set in Dr Feldman's office,
and within the confines of this tiny
auditorium it is almost as if y o u are
sat in on what should be a private
consultation.
Anita Parry really excels in her
role as Stephanie A b r a h a m s , a
young w o m a n in her 30s that has
been confined to a wheelchair by
Multiple Sclerosis. She is pushed by
her husband to seek help through
the well-known Dr Feldman (Peter
Ellis).
Stephanie starts the sessions
with a casual attitude; she obvious-
ly doesn't believe that the treat-
ment is necessary as she has a
strong character and a positive
spirit. She has discussed the conse-
quences of Multiple Sclerosis with
family and friends and has c o m e up
with several plans of action for the
c o m i n g years. Dr Feldman only
serves to irritate her, and his d e m -
anding questions merely spark off
an angry response. Stephanie was
an extremely talented violinist
before this disease destroyed her
ability and, seemingly, her purpose.
Dr Feldman's o w n love of the violin
is evident and he appears to the
audience to share s o m e of
Stephanie's pain. However, she is
blind to this and sees his questions
as a sign of jealousy or incompe-
tence. She feels that Dr Feldman
does not appreciate her intelli-
gence and she plays spiteful games
to try to avoid a confrontation with
her feelings. A s the sessions
progress, she appears even more
child-like. Dr Feldman, however,
continues to probe into her rela-
tionships with her parents and wor-
ried husband. The hard shell that
Stephanie has built around herself
begins to weaken and she finally
unleashes the emotion that she
would have previously c o m m u n i -
cated through her violin.
This d r a m a is p r o f o u n d l y
intense. There are no scenery
changes, no fancy costumes and
certainly no singing or dancing.
The subject has obviously been
well-studied by both the director,
Janeena Sims a n d the actors.
Although Peter Ellis plays his role a
little hard during the first act, the
play still reviews the stereotypes
associated with Freudian psychiatry
and leaves y o u with a m u c h more
humane impression of the profes-
sion.
Extra merit has to go to Anita
w h o talks almost n o n - s t o p
throughout the two hour long play.
O n c e y o u have entered the story
you really d o get involved. W h e n
she falls out of her wheelchair, in
one of the more dramatic scenes,
you instinctively jump up to help
her before realising that you're in a
theatre. You are left with a strong
feeling of reflection... not bad for a
husband and wife duo w h o are best
known for playing in "The Bill".

SALAD DAYS PREVIEW
Union Concert Hall
L
ater this week, Imperial
College Union O p e r a t i c
Society once again takes to
the floorboards to bring us 'Salad
Days', a light carefree musical
about romance, youth a n d . . . well
... a piano. After many weeks of
rehearsals, and worrying, they have
put together a s h o w that must
surely contain something to appeal
to most tastes - memorable tunes,
lively performance, raunchy Dons,
UFO's, cabinet ministers, a n d . . .
well... a piano.
The story starts in a scene I a m
sure will be witnessed by many in
the next few years - a graduation
day. W e meet t w o friends from well
to d o families, Tim and Jane, as
they both graduate and have to say
farewell. They insist on keeping in
touch and arrange to meet the fol-
lowing week, by which time they
discover that both of their families
have different ideas about the
paths through life they should take:
Tim to get a job with one of his
uncles, Jane to marry. It is here that
they meet a tramp w h o pays them
to look after his piano for a month
- a piano that forces everyone w h o
hears it to relax, dance and enjoy
themselves. Needless to say this
leads them on a vast adventure of
secrecy, political scandals and
quests for missing musical instru-
ments ... well ... a piano.
The large cast equip themselves
extremely well through the large
chorus pieces with entertaining
choreography, and there are s o m e
wonderful solos by the leads.
Working with a particularly quirky
script they manage to adapt the
humour in such a way as to provide
moments of bizarre amusement
and crafted wit.
Unfortunately I was not able to
see the s h o w in its full glory of daz-
zling costumes and bright lights,
but this certainly d i d not prevent
the cast from visibly enjoying them-
selves in a spirited performance. So
in these last few days as they are
busy painting set, rigging lights and
trying to keep calm, maybe you
should be thinking about giving
your support to these enthusiastic
performers.

10,000 BROKEN MIRRORS
The Oval Theatre
W
e read the press release
for this play after we had
been persuaded by Julia
to see it. O u r hearts sank. "Two
teenage boys, thrown together by
their parents marriage, develop a
gay relationship." O h no, three
hours of d o o m .
Fortunately this wasn't true. In
the opening scene the audience is
introduced to the four family m e m -
bers, Diana, Lawrence, Aleister,
and Eddie, and the Sun and M o o n ,
who look d o w n on the proceedings
from a raised mobile platform on
the stage. A s the relationship
between the two boys, Aleister and
Eddie unfolds and deepens, so that
between husband and wife is seen
to diminish, with more than a little
help from the m o o n , w h o appears
intent on "helping" the proceedings
on earth. Tensions between the
family members, in particular the
two boys are, in the beginning,
made strikingly clear, but as the
play progresses these feelings are
replaced by new animosity
between the gay lovers and Diana,
who makes no secret of her disap-
proval of the situation.
The Sun and M o o n are always
present, watching the family as
they live their lives. The Sun, repre-
senting 'Good' is content to just
w a t c h a n d let those on earth
resolve their o w n problems, but the
M o o n , portraying the 'Bad' has a
mischevious nature and bored with
just orbiting the earth, decides to
go d o w n and 'help' the family, with
disastrous consequences.
The set was extremely simple
and unusual, consisting of five plat-
forms of different heights, on
wheels. These doubled as beds,
tables and the orbits of the Sun and
M o o n , being m o v e d around the
stage as their uses changed. This
was a little puzzling at first , but
actually worked very well. The light-
ing also added a subtle touch, with
the Sun's yellow light guarding the
married couple while the M o o n ' s
cold blue hue shadowed the illicit
lovers.
Our preconceptions of this play
were not g o o d . After reading the
press release and arriving at the
theatre, which looked like a grotty
primary s c h o o l , w e expected
something m u c h worse, and were
surprised to find we really enjoyed
it.
O h , and by the way, look out
for Tenebris Light on your tube
journey in the morning, as he works
for London Underground!
