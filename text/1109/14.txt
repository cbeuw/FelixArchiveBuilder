CLUBSCENE â€¢ THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE
ie
Anyone connected with the L o n d o n dance
scene will tell y o u that techno is currently going
through a bad patch. S o m e might even say that
it is dying, slowly and painfully. S o m e so-called
"underground" DJs w h o have b e c o m e house-
hold names appear to have lost touch with the
scene that nurtured and raised them. The whole
thing has b e c o m e too commercial, many argue.
With promotors charging more and more to fill
their nights with DJs w h o charge extortionate
booking fees, a n d c o m p e t i t i o n f r o m other
hybrids of music such as drum'n'bass, 97 was a
terrible year for techno.
There is a growing voice however, that is
proclaiming that techno doesn't have to die.
Although the innocence of the s u m m e r of love
now belongs to an older generation and the
'techno-purist' can no longer be catered for,
these people claim to have s o m e valid reasons
for the survival of underground dance music.
O n e of the strongest reasons is Craig Thomas
and his club Analog City.
Despite being involved in electronic music
for many years, Craig is one of a new breed of
DJs. He not only spins internationally o n a regu-
lar basis, but he has learnt the ins and outs of
the music industry. His achievements include
music production and the very succesful Analog
City nights. During the m i d 1990s this was a
club that introduced the sounds of techno to a
large audience. The best A m e r i c a n a n d
European DJs could be found playing on the
same line-up as some excellent home-grown
talent.
The best DJs meant the best music of the
genre, and also an a m a z i n g array of turntable
techniques, transforming a pair of decks into a
musical instrument. This all tied in with Craig's
philosophy that techno music is more than just
computerised grunts and farts, that the words
electronic and funky can be used as adjectives in
the same breath!
Starting off as a music nut, Craig discovered
promotion as a vehicle to further his o w n DJing
career, rather than as a means in itself. After a
few years involvement in the house scene,
Analog City was started in 1994. London's club-
land is a notoriously fickle and competitive ter-
ritory, so it is quite an achievement for a club to
be running for so long. It is also a testament to
Craig's musical background. Clubs may well rely
on business sense, but if y o u can find the bal-
ance between profit and putting on a g o o d
show (ie choosing the right DJs, understanding
your c r o w d , music selection) for your customers
then you're onto a winner! Besides its London
residency, Analog City has toured the U K exten-
sively and even o p e n e d its doors abroad. Craig
cites a recent tour of Croatia as a particularly ful-
filling experience. "It's amazing h o w a war-torn
country can party. It doesn't matter what the
fuck's going o n around y o u . I played in a blown-
out cinema. It was the best experience I've ever
had."
Next Saturday sees Analog City in London
once again. The night proves to be unique and
special in many respects, but I'll leave it to Craig
to explain y o u his concepts in his o w n words.
"We're going for a completely different
approach with this. Basically the nights we put
on in the past were on quite a large scale and
the prices to get in were also high (ten to fifteen
pounds). We're using the Analog City name and
still going for a large crowd and stuff, but we're
trying to keep the prices d o w n .
"With this event we're offering a quality
night where everybody can pay five pounds. I
think that if we can do that and still put on big
underground London DJs , with about fifteen
playing at each night (in three rooms) then it will
be a new way of approaching things. Also the
customers w o n ' t feel ripped off that they're
paying so much money, as they are doing in so
many London clubs at the moment.
"1 don't think you should be charging fifteen
pounds to get into these bloody places. If the
music is meant to be underground, then why are
you paying completely astronomical prices? I'm
going for an approach where you don't have to
charge that much on the door but you are get-
ting quality DJs w h o are up-there in the techno
scene."
That's right! This is a Saturday night club in
London with fifteen of the best techno Djs that
our city has to offer in three rooms and a crack-
ing sound system for just five pounds. Cliched
as it may sound, Craig feels that the well-being
and satisfaction of the customer should c o m e
before mega six-figure profits. H e is also show-
ing us that spending thousands o n commercial-
ly known DJs can be a waste of money. O n e
thing we don't seem to realise is that techno
contains strength in depth. There are many spin-
ners out there w h o can hold a c r o w d , fill a floor
and keep a night going as well as any "name".
They should also be given a chance, and the
respect within the dance community that Analog
City c o m m a n d s is the perfect advertisment for
people to notice them.
The approach to the structure and running
of the night is also being experimented with by
Craig. Rather than having one DJ to play a long
set, the w a r m - u p will be two hours and each guy
afterwards will be o n for an hour. H e claims that
this will pressurise all the DJs to "produce the
g o o d s " quickly and within a set time limit. With
many different DJs playing so closely together,
the whole night looks like keeping a varied and
fresh sound to it. This will be anything but bor-
ing b o o m b o o m techno!"
So w h o are these DJs w h o will be strutting
their stuff at Analog City! O n e of the highlights
will be James Ruskin, founder of the popular
Blueprint label, and co-resident at Circulation in
Brixton with A n d y Weatherall. His style is
described as Jeff Mills-esque but with his o w n
personal twist a d d e d . Charlie Hall has been
instrumental in the s c e n e for years now.
Formerly of the Drum Club Collective (a musical
group and a legendary club), Charlie plays a var-
ied selection but is known to be into his hard
Chicago house. Terry Mitchell is described by
Craig as "one of the best DJs I k n o w " . His style
is raw and in yer face, with scratching and cut-
ting used alongside the techno player's trusty
mixing skills. Finally w e c o m e to Richard
Summerhayes. H e works in Covent Garden's
Eukatech Records and is one of the best but
underrsted spinners currently in the scene.
Incidently, I've only covered one r o o m !
O t h e r p e o p l e a p p e a r i n g will be Dave
Muthersole (of Musikmagazine), M a r k Dale (the
brother of M r Abstrakt Dance Colin Dale, and a
superb DJ in his o w n right) and Keith Anderson.
There will also be some student DJs appearing
who are threatening to break the scene and
make a name for themselves.
Look out for Analog City on Saturday 7
M a r c h 1998 at C a m d e n Island Market (106-110
Kentish T o w n Road; nearest tube C a m d e n
Town) from 10pm till six in the morning. A n d
that wasn't a typing error, tickets are just five
pounds.
The electric cafe, in association with Analog
City is giving away ten pairs of V.I.P. tickets to
this event. Just answer this simple question.
One of Craig Thomas' favourite techno
producers is " M a d " Mike Banks, who started
Underground Resistance Records in Detroit.
In which US state is the city of Detroit?
