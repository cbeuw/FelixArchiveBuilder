HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON
Photographs at the Hayward Gallery
T
his exhibition is primarily a
celebration of one of this
century's greatest photogra-
phers in his 90th year. Evidently
Cartier-Bresson has an extraordi-
nary ability to find the character in
the crowd or the back street of any
provincial t o w n . H e dispels any
notion that photographic art is
solely for the appreciation of the
initiated with a style that is both
direct, human and displays a truly
magic eye. The photographs are
simplistically displayed, spanning
nearly seventy years of travel
throughout Europe, from Istanbul
to Islington. They refrain, however,
from being journalistic or d o c u -
mentative in style due to their
objectivity and their attentiveness
to aesthetic effect. Hardly any of
the photos record a specific his-
toric event, the vast majority
focussing o n the description of the
lives of ordinary Europeans.
It is easy to forget in this era of
readily available consumer durables
the privations and struggles which
only fifty years ago were c o m m o n -
place. Cartier-Bresson takes us
through the years of pre-war
depression and post-war recon-
struction with marked optimism,
compassion and wit. High-spirited
street children are portrayed play-
ing in civil war torn Seville through
a bomb-damaged wall. Muscovites
crowd Red Square for the 1954
agricultural show with not a prod-
uct of collective farming in sight.
The astonishing spontaneity of
the photographs often result in a
natural surrealism; one shot por-
trays a double bass seemingly rid-
ing a bike d o w n a rocky Serbian dirt
track to nowhere. O n e of the most
t o u c h i n g photos captures t w o
sleeping lovers o n a Romanian
night train, an acknowledgement of
an instantaneous beauty that would
pass most of us by. O n e disap-
pointment is the display's British
photos, which inevitably show less
empathy with their primarily aristo-
cratic subject matter.
Cartier-Bresson described his
work as "putting one's head, one's
eye and one's heart on the same
axis". W e w o u l d strongly recom-
m e n d this vast exhibition to any-
one; it will not fail to inspire both
Europeans and non-Europeans.

s a d l y lack.
The largest exhibit on display
was specially created and can hard-
ly fail to be noticed. Entitled "Brick
Wall", it is not just one large brick
wall, but several arranged so that
they are parallel and interlinking,
displaying superb bricklaying skills.
1 walked around them several times
wondering h o w to appreciate the
true artistic potential of this piece.
The children unwillingly dragged to
the Tate by their arty parents
thought it was great fun, as it pro-
vided the perfect backdrop for a
game of hide and seek.
The exhibition runs until M a y
but I wouldn't r e c o m m e n d making
a special trip, unless y o u are inter-
ested in bricklaying; your time
would be better spent looking at
the special Bonnard exhibition or
wandering around the other gal-
leries.

SHOSTAKOVICH
Barbican Centre
CAMPANAS FLAMENCAS
PEACOCK THEATRE
T
he cycle of Shostakovich's
music is being given rave
press reviews. S o m e h o w ,
these concerts are inspiring the
LSO to play as if they are indeed
one of the greatest orchestras in
the world; credit for this remark-
able achievement must be given to
Rostropovich, w h o was a great
friend of the c o m p o s e r for over 30
years. I found Rostro-povich's
approach a little too serious for the
more frivolous pieces but this paid
off for the m o r e intense a n d
atmospheric symphonic works.
The next ones include the p o p -
ular 5th symphony in the same
concert as the 6th symphony, a
chamber concert by an all star cast
led by Rostropovich - this time
showing off his virtuoso 'cello play-
ing - and two concerts of the 7th
symphony. For those of y o u w h o
are not so familiar with this s y m -
phony or even of Shostakovich's
music, the concert on M a r c h 5th
will introduce this great musical
a n d political work, written in
Leningrad while under siege by the
Nazis. Tickets are extremely rea-
sonable, with standby available on
the night to anyone brandishing a
student card.

In the same area, the Guildhall
School of M u s i c are putting on a
performance of the Barber of
Seville, the famous Rossini opera.
Anyone interested in going to see
opera cheaply should definitely go
along to see this reputedly excel-
lent production.

"Campanas Flamencas"
is a dazzling show of
short dance
sequences, performed
with breathtaking ener-
gy and burning pas-
sion.
It is vibrant and
takes us back to the
intimate and sponta-
neous roots of
Flamenco, in
Andalucia, drawing its
inspiration from the
intense feeling of joy
and sorrow, passion
and pain, exhaltation
and agony.
A 'disciplined' and quiet London
audience was quickly set on fire by
the performers - amongst w h o m
are such established stars as La
Tati, M i l a g r o s M e n g i b a r and
Joaquin Grilo - w h o reached the
soul of the Hispanic
spectators and led the
rest into a certain
w o n d e r and the expe-
rience of an unprece-
d e n t e d sensation in
front of such incom-
parable fire and ener-
gy-
The only thing
which may cause a
certain 'dilution' of the
atmosphere, a 'disin-
tensification' of the
p e r f o r m a n c e is the
size of the theatre,
certainly too big to
retain a n d carry
through, as it would in
a typical Spanish 'tablao', all the
extraordinary power of the dancing
and the singing.
