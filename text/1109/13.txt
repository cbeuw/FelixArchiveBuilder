W W nited D)s of A m e r i c a have
I been highlighting the cream
of America's D| talent and
MUSIC 13
DOPE UP FOR GRABS !
DOPE O N PLASTIC VOL.5
Yl
lost talented,
on fire, o n
;e DJs in the
i d e e d but is it
er a rich blend
still in the
i different
<ing if y o u
res w e have another competi-
tion for you lucky people with
more C D s to give away THREE
in fact, so y o u can judge for your-
selves if this latest release from the
long running and highly successful
D o p e O n Plastic series (sold over
150,000 copies) lives up to the
standard they have already set.
John Stapleton's mixing is first
class, neat and tidy as y o u would
expect from such a veteran. Mixing
and blending the tunes to near per-
fection.
This compilation is packed with
19 fat cuts, a fusion of d o w n beats
'n' breaks with phat h i p - h o p
flavours. Some of the highlights are
Steady G , DJ For Prez, W a y Out
West with King Of Funk, and the
massive B-Boy Stance by the
Freestylers.
There is nothing inherently
wrong with this C D , but there does
seem to be something missing; it
never really grabs your attention
and locks y o u into it. I could not
put my finger on why this is just
alright and not a must have, as it
has such a strong selection of
tracks and the mixing is spot on but
it all just doesn't click.
N o w here's your chance to find
out for yourselves, by answering
the following question.
Where does D) Jam/ John
Stapleton live and host his
monthly Blow Pop club ?

B. Cleethorpes

I could not make my mind up
wether this is drum &. bass with a
touch of jazz, or jazz with a heavy
touch of D & B as it is very evenly
balanced. A n d the rolling jazz licks
never really overpower or sound
out of place here, they merely
complement each other. It's nice
to hear such original work. It has
already got it's o w n sub-genre,
being described as loungecore by
some and this is a very fitting
description as it sits neatly
between being chilling lounge
music and full on drum &. bass.
Another dimension of what is
know as drum &l>ass but y o u do, at
least, have to appreciate jazz music
to enjoy this album. tTlcl Jo Public
D R U M ' N ' B A S S H O U S E
Chocolate weasel. Music for Body Rockers.
(Ninja)16th Feb.
This latest offering from T-Power and a c c o m -
plish is a slow t e m p o big beat sort of ting, with
heavy electro influences. O n e of the mixes
starts off sounding like Billy Jean, then when the
bass comes in it sounds like Another One Bites
The Dust; then the strong atmosphereicals
come in and you're away. This is my favourite
mix. There's also Jah Rasta dub ragga mix as
well that works and is a little different. '
Bowser. Street Beat EP.
(Freshkanova) 2nd March
A firing selection of beats, my favourite track is
Let Ya Body Rock. Clever programming, nice lit-
tle touches of scratching, lovely c h o p p e d - u p
beats and plenty else going on to keep you
interested. This all combines to make for a
totally original and superb track.
Blame. Visions Of Mars.
(Goodlooking Rec.) 2nd March.
Blame the man w h o brought us Music Takes
You (moving shadow) back in '92, (I wonder
w h o remembers that?). A n d he's still got the
touch, another truly breath-taking track. Those
of y o u w h o ' v e heard Blame's Logical
Progression Pt.Z C D (a great m o m e n t in musi-
cal history), this is the first track from that C D .
Drift along on the futuristic breaks, soothing b-
line, robotic voices &. deep lush break d o w n s .
Enjoy the visions of Mars.
Scarlet Lake. Into The Sun.
(Temple Rec) mid March.
This sounds like Roni Size (b-line) meets Bukem
(clean crisp beats) which works well with a nice
cheesy American film sample, but they have
over done it a bit with the general jazz backing
at times. Future Engineer's remix strips away
the Roni b-line and jazz piano, makes it more of
an out ' n ' out intelligent style which I do like; it
could almost be Bukem.
Fifty Fifty. Tonight I'm dreaming
(Jackpot) 1 st March
I preferred the Amethyst's dub mix to the orig-
inal which isn't a bad track in itself. Amethyst
cut d o w n on the vocal, darken the atmos. and
sneak some D&J5 style drum/brake patterns into
the programmer. W h i c h all works rather well,
creating a hypnotic deep house feeling. The
original mix is more vocal &. up-beat, with a
stomping b-line.
The Talisman & Hudson.
Horizontal Recreation. (C.S.M.F)
This is a hypnotic blend of deep house and
electro styles reminiscent of Orbital, but under
the s m o o t h computer programming and boun-
cy bass-line there is quite a hard track hiding
away. This is different to what I have been hear-
ing recently, it has an early hardcore ('90-'92)
feel to it but with new technology making for a
pleasant break from the norm. This track has
strength in depth, and will make a welcome
addition to my box. 171 cl jo Public
