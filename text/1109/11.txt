S
hifty D i s c o is an O x f o r d
based independent label w h o
have just released this c o m -
pilation of some of their best tunes
of last year.
The tracks on this C D range
from thrash rock to trash lo-fi elec-
tronica with s o m e tripped-out bal-
lads thrown in here and there for
g o o d measure. A lot of the tunes
have a 'recorded-on-a-four-track-
in-my-mates-garage' feel to them,
but this only serves to make the
compilation something y o u w o n ' t
get sick of listening to.
Unfortunately, as a lot of the songs
are some of the bands' first mater-
ial, it is a little dull so it's never
going to be at the top of m y stack.
O n e track that stands out miles
above the rest, is Building by The
Unbelievable Truth - a band to
watch out for. It's a sort of R E M
style ballad with really strong
vocals c o m i n g from A n d y Yorke,
brother of R a d i o h e a d ' s Thorn
Yorke. The Radiohead influence is
evident, but the style is sufficiently
original to set them apart so hope-
fully the inevitable comparisons in
the press won't drag them d o w n .
The other songs are mostly
credible, with stuff like Blah Na Na
by Impossible M u s i c Force and
Magdalen Sky by M a r k Gardener
making the whole thing a very
pleasant listen. M i n d y o u , I really
can't work out what's going on
with the DJ Remould and Spunkle
tunes. They're a sort of cross
between a very early Erasure d e m o
and an episode of Teletubbies.
The material being promoted
here is all very worthy and it's the
kind of album I'd be really happy
about owning if it came free on the
front cover of the N M E . I'd say that
it's definitely worth keeping track
of future Shifty Disco releases for
the sort of g e m s that are hidden on
this C D . d
William Smith
A
n opening raucous anthemic
rant delivered at break-neck
speed is usually e m p l o y e d to
try to jumpstart s o m e artists'
albums into action, disguising the
inevitable dive into the m u c h slow-
er and less exhilarating numbers.
The Beekeepers d o not employ this
tactic. The album c o m m e n c e s with
the comparatively quiet and per-
sonal Eyeballed, which happens to
be the only track written by lead
singer Jamie East. From there,
we're thrown into the aggression-
fuelled and indie-fied punk world
that is home to these guardians of
honey-makers.
W i t h this short a m o u n t of
material, it's surprising to report
that bombshells feel like they're
being d r o p p e d left, right and cen-
tre. Killer Cure chainsaws its way
into your mind with its mix of spiky
guitats and layered vocals. The
infectious Do You Behave Like That
at Home? cuts itself into your sonic
stomach and churns itself over and
over. There's also Beau Peepshow,
Second Skin and Catgut to chew on
for dessert if you're still hungry for
more. However, if you feel like
you're going to get chronic punk
indigestion, relief can be found
slightly in / Only Want To See You;
Suffer and Elsewhere to ease the
razorblade riffs a n d rampaging
rants. There's also a c o m i c bonus
track at the end, which is outra-
geously ridiculous; I'll just say that
it tells the story of mice singing at
the Albert Hall!
Third Party, Fear and Theft is a
fantastically fiery album but the
B e e k e e p e r s ' turbulent s o u n d is
best experienced live. It would be
wise to try and catch them soon
before they explode along with
a c c o m p a n y i n g ticket prices.
However, y o u could always get
yourself a copy of the album now:
for insurance purposes, naturallyEl

Dust Junkys - What Time Is It?
The Dust Junkys sound like a cross between
Black Grape and Fun Loving Criminals on happy
pills. A funky, catchy, little summer tune.
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N 1
Mandalay - Flowers Bloom
For some strange reason the radio edit is
remixed by Alex Reece. Reece destroys the bril-
liant lyrical composition of the original, featured
as a B-side, but adds not such a bad dark
sounding tune. The original however is excellent
drum 'n' bass with floaty female vocals.
Senser - Breed
Senser got rid of three out of their original line
up of five and now it's Kerstin singing with the
tune, crunching guitars, hip hop beats and
effects sounding the same as ever. The rock rap
cross over was fairly fresh four years ago when
Senser were making all the right noises and
headlines. Unfortunately this will d o neither for
them.
Ramzi
Karen Ramirez - Distant Dreams CD Sampler
O n e thing - the girl can sing! Different styles
over different production styles show she is
adaptable but titles like Troubled Girl, Looking
for Love, If W e Try, and Lies seem to indicate
the usual tried and tested subject matter but for
most people that isn't a problem. Apart from
that, this is a promising start for her.
Lionrock - Rude Boy Rock
Throw this on the decks, lay back and just relax
... scarcely any vocals here ... just music, and it
is all g o o d for that. Just rock wit d e m ! O n the
flip, Best Foot Forward will satiate the hunger of
the dance crew and Push Button Cocktail is
another compelling track. Definitely worth get-
ting.
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N 2
Bim Sherman - Earth People
A refreshingly original s o n g infused with the
tabla sounds of Talvin Singh. The man's voice is
just too g o o d , and with his lyrics, make a bril-
liant track. The remix by Ronnie &. Clyde take it
into drum bass land, which turns out to be
surprisingly g o o d ! El
