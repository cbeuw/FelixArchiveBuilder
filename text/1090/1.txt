C&GU in 'cash for questions' row
NEWSTEAM
An incredulous Imperial College
Union Council on Tuesday night
heard City & Guilds Union President
Guarav Misra admit that thousands
of pounds of unaccounted funds lay
in a safe near the C & G U offices. The
money had been accrued as part of a
scheme to sell copies of mechanical
engineering exam papers and tutorial
sheets to students.
The meeting heard how the
C&GU's top three, Mr Misra,
Honourary Junior Treasurer Martin
Ayers and Honourary Secretary
Andy Gilder, had taken on the task
after the Mechanical Engineering
Departmental Library refused to con-
tinue loaning papers to undergradu-
ates. Though previously a free ser-
vice, the copies available through the
C & G U Office cost between £15 and
£45 for a set of papers and worked
tutorial sheets. Mr Misra defended
this pricing regime, saying that "the
students were getting a good service"
and that the exam paper packages
"involved a lot of photocopying" by
the three officers.
The officers also came under
attack concerning their practice of
not banking the proceeds of the exam
paper sales, estimated at around
£3,000. Standard accounting practice
for clubs and societies, as outlined in
ICU's Finance Handbook, is to log
all income and expenditure and for-
ward cash and cheques to the Finance
Office to be banked. This malpractice
may also have V A T and NI implica-
tions.
Some members of Council raised
fears that the prices were extraordi-
nary given that the service was for
students. Indeed, profits on the sales
amounted to nearly £1,000.
Normally, money earned by the club
themselves and not part of their bud-
get, known as 'self-generated
income' would be available for the
club to spend as they wished.

Amber light for JCR refurbishment
/I
N E W S T E A M
College officials have this week
given the go-ahead to a dramatic
refurbishment of the Junior Common
Room, due to begin in the summer of
1998.
Plans currently being drawn up by
the Estates Design Office include the
removal of most of the JCR wall
adjoining the walkway and its
replacement with a curving glass
screen This new glass fascia will be
concave, widening the walkway and
allowing passers-by to see through
the JCR and out onto the Queen's
lawn. STA Travel and the QT snack-
bar will be relocated to either side of
the walkway entrance, both benefit-
ing from a more prominent glass
frontage and a slight increase in floor
space. Within the JCR, a raised 'bar-
rel vault' ceiling will attempt to
instill a sense of space, while an
imaginative combination of
improved lighting and ventilation
will be employed to create a lighter,
airier environment. Particular atten-
tion will be paid to the floor, the tim-
ber being re-polished and comple-
mented by the use of brightly
coloured floor coverings. The space

vacated by QT at the rear of the room
will be home to the arcade games and
vending machines. On the opposite
side, College Catering officials are
considering plans to introduce a com-
bined licensed bar and hot food
servery.
The scheme, as originally pro-
posed, was due to start with a period
of consultation beginning in May of
this year, with building work com-
mencing in mid-July. However, due
to disagreements concerning sources
of funding for the project, alterations
will instead begin next summer.
Under this regime, the refurbishment
should be completed by the second
week of November 1998 and, as a
result, it is likely that students will be
denied access to the JCR during the
first half of the first term. It is not yet
clear whether alternative facilities
will be made available.
As reported in Felix last week,
precedent would suggest that the cost
of the project be shared between
