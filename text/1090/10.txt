It's a scorchingly hot day and, having missed
Linoleum and Fountains of Wayne due to
British Rail's signal failures, I get to the sight
and make it through the frighten-
ingly rigorous securiry cordon.
The Wonnadies are playing
something on the main stage that
I vaguely recognise, but can't
make out over the din generated
from the other tents in the vicinity.
Nice to see so many acts here, but the cross-
over of sound is appaling. Trudge over to see
Sneaker Pimps, along with a couple of thou-
sand other punters. The place is jammed, but

They've found their level in the gig circuit, and, I

for quite a while yet.
David Devant and his Spirit Wrfe were rele-
gated to the claustrophobic 'Havin' if tent
where they put on a less than poiisned perfor-
mance. AAuybe they're not used to having to
play a scaled down set Still they showed they
could pull off their 'backing theatre' even when
performing in a tent in a field. The unfamiliar
