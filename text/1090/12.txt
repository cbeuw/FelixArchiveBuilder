Ents preview: The Summer Carnival
This is the end....
Another year races to it's conclusion, which apart
from the depressing inevitability of exams, can only
mean one thing ...the Summer Carnival. And this
year's event will guarantee that June 20th will be a
night you'll remember for a long time.
As usual the Union building will be given over to a
final pursuit of pure hedonism, with something for
everyone, as ICU ents bow out after our most suc-
cessful year to date. This time out, not only will w e
be stuffing the building with music and dancing, but
the Quad will also be put to good use. Negotiations
are currently under way to put some form of PA out-
side for a special open air chill-out area, but w e can
guarantee that the first thing you see when you
come in will be the Space Quasar unit - a big
roomed bouncy castle that you can enter and shoot
the hell out of all your friends!! And as many goes
as you want are included in the ticket price!
Starting in dBs, we've got two live bands - top parly
funk from College band "Funk and Disorderly", and
the ideal summery acid jazz sounds of 'Tarantella" -
both guaranteed to get you sweating on the dance-
floor. Then to step up the heat there's tunes from
both the Shaft and Pop Tarts DJs until 3am, so you
can relive all your favourite ICU memories.
The UDH once again plays home to our blissed out
Cocktail Bar, with Djs playing tunes to keep you cool.
If you like your swing, soul or R&B then Flava in the
gym is the room for you, and to spice things up, and
to give all you budding M C s a voice, there'll be a
special freestyle showdown at midnight - so be
ready to bring the noise.
Finally for all you club heads, the very best upfront
tunes will be slamming your way as Hedonizm
takes control of the 1210s in the Concert Hall. Also in
there you'll find a hour of banging tracks mixed up
live from Nocturne.
Decor as usual comes from the Big Picture Co. and
there's going to be a distinctly psychedelic feel to the
whole proceedings - so dress up nice and bright for
the night! All this, as well as a huge barbecue, a
2am bar (subject to licence), and some yet to be
confirmed surprises are yours for just £6 (£5 with a n
entscard), and tickets are on sale now from the
Union Office. Don't leave it too late - you don't want
to miss this!
