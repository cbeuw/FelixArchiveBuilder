Confusion reigns in Southwell Hall shake-up
JEREMY T H O M S O N
After B five year delay, refurbishment
of the ageing Evelyn Garden halls is
once again underway. The first to
benefit will be Southwell Hall, with
house numbers 57 to 60 undergoing a
major refit over the summer vacation
and part way into next term.
The provisional plans include the
removal of two stairwells and several
internal walls, facilitating thirteen
new beds, thirty-five new showers,
improved kitchens and a laundry.
The plumbing and electrics will be
overhauled, floors and ceilings
renewed and the exterior of the hall
retouched. This will be achieved at
the expense of the old bathrooms and
some of the social areas, leaving just
one lounge for over ninety students.
Work will commence in mid July
and is likely to continue until
November, necessitating temporary
accommodation for the new first year
students. At a recent meeting of the
Rector's Committee on Student
Residences, plans were made to relo-
cate the eighty-eight displaced stu-
dents to Montpelier hall in
Knightsbridge; the postgraduate hos-
tel that was due for closure at the end
of this academic year. Concerns have
Long-overdue refurbishment awaits
been raised about the poor quality of
these residences, and the cost of nec-
essary repairs is so high that they
were due to be sold at the end of this
academic year. Complaints from cur-
rent residents include unacceptably
small rooms, poor plumbing and
power cuts.
Dr Margaret Goodgame, student
councillor, opined that "the situation
is not ideal" but did not express any
specific objections to the plans. Ken
Young, who is both the Warden of
Southwell and a member of the
estates team, agreed saying that "we

have done and will continue to house
students in worse accommodation
than [Montpelier hall]", citing
Garden Hall as an example. He also
told Felix that the displaced students
will only be expected to pay the
lower Montpelier rent for their first
term. His main concern as Warden
was the splitting of the hall commu-
nity for the crucial first few weeks
and the difficulties of caring for stu-
dents in a residence that will effec-
tively be bisected next year.
It is currently unclear who will be
responsible for the students at
Montpelier hall as current warden Dr
Richard Clarke and his assistants
were expecting to be relieved of their
posts this academic year. Recent
attempts to recruit new wardens and
sub-wardens have not proved very
fruitful, and Dr Clarke may continue
to serve Montpelier hall next term.
Another problem will be the loss
of cheap student summer accommo-
dation, popular with exchange stu-
dents and those wishing to remain in
London. The heavy building work is
likely to force the closure of neigh-
bouring Holbein House as well as the
rest of Southwell hall for an extended
period. The Estates Division is hop-
ing to complete the noisy work by the
end of the summer to avoid disrup-
tion to students returning in the
autumn.
Sharine Brown, Residences
Manager, also expressed regret that
the all work could not be completed
in time for the freshers' arrival in
October. It is uncertain whether this
will be possible next year when the
remaining parts of Southwell will be
rebuilt. By this time, Montpelier hall
will not be available as back-up so
any overrun on the building schedule
would be highly problematic.

Students throughout the capital can
look forward to more transport mis-
ery after London Transport, the
authority that runs the tube and bus
services in London, backed down
from a commitment to allow people
in full-time education a reduced fare.
After a three month trial last year, LT
have decided that they will not be
implementing a cheap fare scheme
for students.
From September to December of
last year, students from Queen Mary
and Westfield College in East
London took part in a pilot scheme in
which they were issued with student
photocards. On presentation of a stu-
dent photocard, participants received
a third off the standard price of
monthly travelcards and bus basses.
Although London Transport have
made it known that they were not sat-
isfied with the results of the trial, the
exact cause of discontent remains
unclear. The University of London
Union Vice President of Welfare and
Represention, Paul Bates, said that it
was disappointing that U L U has, as
yet, received no information from
Q M W Student Union about the
results of the trial.
This lack of feedback has made it
difficult for U L U sabbaticals to con-
tinue campaigning for cheaper fares
for students, leaving them to face
continued criticism and allegations
of inaction from the Unions of the
constituent colleges that make up the
University of London.
New London authority
EDWARD S H E R M A N
The new Government's plans for a
'strategic authority' for London have
become a little clearer this week,
with the announcement that they
expect to hold a referendum on the
subject in May 1998. It is still
unclear whether this plebiscite will
allow Londoners to decide whether
the capital should have a directly
elected Mayor or whether a single
question will be posed.
Labour's manifesto had promised
to "create a directly elected strategic
authority for London, with the con-
sent of the people of London", but
minimal reference to this in the
recent Queen's Speech had caused
concern that this promise was of low
priority to the Government. Two
London MPs have questioned
Labour's commitment to a policy
which has wide support throughout
the city.
Replying to a question from
Stephen Timms, a Labour back-
bencher and MP for East Ham, the
Deputy Prime Minister, John
Prescott, announced that he
"expect[s] that the new mayor and
authority will be elected in May
2000".
Whilst this is later than many com-
mentators had previously predicted,
a spokeswoman for the Department
of the Environment, which is respon-
sible for introducing the measures,
insisted that this is the earliest possi-
ble opportunity. With a consultative
document setting forth Government
proposals due by the end of July,
paving legislation needed to hold the
May 1998 referendum is expected by
November of this year. The substan-
tive bill to set up the new authority
will then follow.
Nick Raynsford, Parliamentary
Under Secretary of State at the DOE
and Minister for London, will be
consulting widely on the remit of the
new authority, together with its rela-
tionship with London's planned
Regional Development Authority. It
is unclear to whom the RDA will be
accountable but according to the
Department of the Environment it
will be responsible for "economic
development and regeneration."
Many Londoners have felt that
with the political landscape moving
toward an acceptance of regional
authorities for Scotland, Wales and
possibly Northern Ireland, the capital
would suffer a 'democratic deficit'
from not having its own elected
body.
