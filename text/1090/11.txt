To use an apt metaphor this album is like an
olive! It is juicy and ripe on the outside, with
promise of more classically awesome tracks
like their chart topping You're Not Alone. But as
you bite into the album you hit a hard stone -
that of dull mediocrity. The first track Miracle
begins with a swirling ambient two minute
introduction and it doesn't really get an better
through its full seven and a half minutes.
There is a steady mix in styles throughout
the album, tracks like Curious combine a
strange reggae/drum n' bass concoction, oth-
ers sound like a more moody Everything But
The Girl. There is even a hint of hip hop in the
last track / Don't Think So which sounds like a
sub standard Portishead B-side. And if you
really, really want you can wait the five or so
minutes after the album is meant to have fin-
ished for a hidden remix of Y.N.A. with all the
good bits taken out!
Extra virgin is not a bad album at all if you
like pleasant, ambient pop. It is produced very
nicely and there are one or Iwo good tracks,
Safer Hands and Blood Red Tears being the
two. With a few good dance remixes, Olive
will flog at least another number one out of
Extra Virgin.
If you buy this album expecting twelve bril-
liant dance tracks be prepared to have your
finger glued to the rewind button as You're Not
Alone comes to its sublime end. You have been
warned. (5)

Cinnamon Smith - Back fo her mother
Threatening bass heavy funk rock with a psy-
ched-up Wire riff and refreshingly energetic
vocal. If MC 900ft Jesus were an indie band
they wot d like this. Well worth a go.

18 Wheeler - The hours and the limes
To be honest, the a-side is a bit of an indie
wankballad. Ifs not a bad song, but the elec-
tronics applied are completely inappropriate.
Make - / Dream Abused
This sounds like Rage Against The Machine in
the verse and Extreme in the chorus; a worse
combination I could never imagine. More than
a bit arse to be truthful.

An eclectic mix of ambient house, a looping

Garageland - The Come Back Special EP
Released in the UK after ten months
of dominating their native New Zealand and
sounding like a less sleepy Sonic Youth, there
is nothing new here, but I'll be looking out for
their name in the future.
