Court summons for C&GU

However, fears were expressed that,
given the fast approaching end of
term, the scope for spending on stu-
dent activities would be limited.
In a separate development, it tran-
spired that the cancellation of last
term's C & G U Easter Dinner has
continued to generate problems. An
entertainments company, hired for
the night in question, is suing the
Union for breach of contract after the
dinner was called off.
Despite returning the contract
unsigned, Mr Ayres received invoic-
es and letters from the company
demanding the full payment of £700
for the booking. The firm maintains
that, in a telephone conversation with
Mr Ayres, a "verbal contract" was
formed thus making C & G U , and
subsequently ICU, liable for the fee.
Council heard how the dealings
with the company only came to light
beyond the inner circle of C & G U
when a court summons arrived, por-
tentously on the morning of the
meeting. Before this, Mr Misra and
his team had taken advice from Dr
Crofton of the Mechanical
Engineering department and attempt-
ed to "meet the company half-way"
by sending £200 in payment of the
outstanding invoice. This evidently
proved futile as the firm took legal
advice and sought recompense via
the courts.
These revelations brought more
expressions of scorn and disbelief
from Council members, who decided
that the summons would be dealt
with by ICU in consultation with its
solicitors, whilst the money from the
sale of exam papers would be prop-
erly accounted for and banked.
Debate then settled on the issue of
whether past exam papers from all
departments could be sold or other-
wise made available at some central
location such as the Union Shop, per-
haps at cost price. Council agreed to
investigate this possibility, pending
negotiations with individual depart-
ments.
In the midst of this discussion, the
representatives from C & G U left the
room. They have since been unavail-
able for comment. It is not known
whether moves to discipline the con-
stituent college union and its execu-
tive will be initiated before the end of
term.
Presidential race kicks off

N E W S T E A M
The third and hopefully final election
contest for the post of Imperial
College Union President for 1997-98
had a positive start this week when
four candidates achieved the full
quota of twenty seconders.
Papers for the post came down on
Wednesday this week heralding one
and a half week's campaigning
before voting in all departments on
16th and 17th of June. Two other
students had signed up for election,
but failed to gain the necessary num-
ber of seconders.
The four fully nominated candi-
dates are Paul Brown, a Mechanical
Engineering Post-Graduate; Mo
Dulloo, Physics IV; Richard
Stultiens, Geology III; and Laurie
Tweedale of Computing III.
Hustings for the elections, a forum
for students to quiz potential
Presidents' intentions, are to be held
in dBs at 5.00pm on Monday 9th
June and in Gladys' Bar at St Mary's
on 11th June.
News in Brief
IC G R A D S T A K E OFF!
Research published in The Times
and Guardian newspapers this week
shows that Imperial College students
top the list when it comes to salary
expectations.
Beating students from Oxford and
Cambridge into second and third
place, IC graduates expect to be earn-
ing at least £18,200 in their first year,
compared to an average graduate
wage of £14,400. These rankings are
mirrored in the salary expected after
five years employment, with IC
graduates refusing to get out of bed
for less than £34,800, putting
Cambridge graduates' £31,000 in the
shade.
Other results of the study, com-
missioned by The Times newspaper
group and conducted by High Fliers
Research, reveal that 46% of IC stu-
dents expect to start a 'graduate-
type' job after leaving, just below the
top score of 50% by Aston.
Finally, the organisation that came
up most often in students aspirations
of employment was the BBC, way
ahead of the Civil Service and self
employment. The survey allowed
respondents a free choice for this cat-
egory, producing esoteric results:
NASA came 9th and Greenpeace
26th, the latter beating KPMG, Sony
and British Aerospace.

The trials and trepidations of
Imperial College students' examina-
tion experience pale in comparison
with that of computing students at
the London School of Economics.
Examinees arriving for their finals
armed with weeks of revision and
cramming discovered that their
preparation was all for nought.
Unbeknownst to them, the exam
papers held all the answers on a sheet
attached at the back.
Sources reveal that none of the
students drew attention to the error -
each believed that they alone were
recipients of the gift. However, the
invigilators of the exam discovered
the extra sheet fifteen minutes after
the exam had started.
Candidates have been told that
they must re-sit a different exam later
this summer.
L A D S B U N G E E TO NZ
A team of students from Imperial
College have scooped a free holiday
in a travel competition organised by
STA Travel this week. The winner
will spend two weeks in New
Zealand after beating off competition
from all over the country in STA's
Adrenaline Challenge.
The team comprising Chris
Balding (Physics II); Amir Hasan
(Chem Eng II); Mike Powell (Aero
II); and Andy Smith (Materials II),
had to answer questions about New
Zealand and complete high-adrena-
line challenges such as Bungee
Running. Although running second
for most of the competition, which
was held at U L U on Tuesday night,
the team came back on the last ques-
tion. Other universities who took part
included Strathclyde, Manchester,
Glasgow, Oxford Brookes and
Western England.
Team captain Amir Hasan
described the competition as "a good
blag" and said that he and his team
mates were looking forward to see
what the antipodes had to offer in the
way of high-energy sports.
