After much con-
troversy over its
content since its
screening at the
1996 Cannes Film Festival, David Cronenberg's Crash has
finally obtained an 18 certificate and is released uncut in
the UK. Based on a JG Ballard novel, the film deals with
the association of sexual excitement with car crashes and
the injuries they cause.
Advertising executive James Ballard (James Spader)
and his wife Catherine (Deborah Unger) are unable to find
sexual satisfaction inside or outside marriage. Following a
car crash belween James and Dr Helen Remington (Holly
Hunter) in which her husband dies, James and Catherine
fall in with scientist/photographer Vaughan (Elias Koteas)
who believes that car crashes result in "a liberation of
sexual energy". Vaughan is so obsessed with car crashes
that he spends his time reconstructing fatal car crashes of
movie stars who became sex symbols after dying young,
such as James Dean. The result of the couple's encounter
with Vaughan is that they too come to discover the sexual
pleasure that can be derived from road accidents.
The car crash is a fertilizing rather
than a destructive event.
Cronenberg has already gained a reputation for being
an audacious and provocative film maker who perhaps
has a bit of a warped imagination; his most memorable
work includes The Fly and Dead Ringers. The idea for
Crash is an intriguing one but beyond the sex and car
crashes, there is not much else. The film disturbs and
shocks but has few other merits. The characters lack per-
© sonality and as a
result the audience
feels nothing for
them.
As for whether the film should have been banned, I
agree with the view that it is wrong for one group of
adults to decide what another group of adults can or
cannot watch. What makes Crash so disturbing is the fact
that it deals with a form of human sexuality that has so far
not been examined in a mainstream film. However, the
film is hardly going to encourage viewers to go out in their
car and crash it in order to obtain sexual fulfillment - the
characters and their behaviour are more likely to disgust
and repel than to encourage viewers to copy them.
Personally, I think Crash is a horrible film, but in light of
all the hype and controversy which surround it, this is
hardly going to stop people flocking to the cinema to see
what all the fuss is about. Jenny
