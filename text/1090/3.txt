FELIX FRIDAY 6TH IUNE NEWS 3
'Desperately needed' JCR refurbishment to begin 1998
continued from front page
three sources, namely College cater-
ing, College Estates division and
Imperial College Union. ICU repre-
sentatives initially reacted with dis-
may at suggestions that the Union
make a substantial contribution,
claiming that the JCR is entirely
College-run and thus generates no
revenue for the Union. Furthermore,
Union officials were unwilling to
commit such a large portion of their
reserves to the JCR, given their pro-
posed expansion of student facilities
in Beit Quad in anticipation of the
medical merger.
Fearing the worst, Some student
sources went on to suggest that the
College might use the Union's reti-
cence as an excuse to further post-
pone or even scrap plans for the des-
perately-needed JCR refurbishment.
These fears were allayed this week,
when a meeting of the College House
Committee ruled that ICU holds no
responsibility for the management or
maintenance of the JCR, and more-
over, that the Estates division should
bear the brunt of the cost with the
Catering and Conferences depart-
ments also contributing.

The project as proposed will total
around £337,000, including all build-
ing work and ancillary fittings. Of
diis, the curved glazed wall alone
will cost £45,000 with new tables
and chairs totalling a further £35,000.
According to ICU Deputy President
Piers Williams, the current JCR fur-
niture "...needs to be thrown out
immediately." However, officials
present at the meeting felt it would be
unwise to replace the furniture before
the rest of the JCR face-lift is com-

may appear from the walkway,
plete, as this might lead to its becom-
ing prematurely dilapidated. One
proposal under consideration is that
an 'intermediate' set of new tables
and chairs be purchased for next
year, and then be retired after one
year to replace the furniture of a sim-
ilarly poor quality in Southside upper
lounge.
It is likely that a majority of IC stu-
dents will welcome any improve-
ment to the JCR, which has not seen
any significant renovations since the
early 1980's. It is hoped that the
refurbishment will go some way in
addressing the general gloominess of
both the JCR and the walkway, the
isolation and identity crisis of QT
and the lack of any provision or toi-
lets for the disabled. As can be seen,
the renewed JCR will closely resem-
ble other recent projects by the
Estates Design Office, such as the
dB's venue and, to a lesser extent, the
new Union Shop.
The relocation of QT is interpreted
by some as a further move towards
creating a 'student services shopping
mail' along the Sherfield walkway,
which might conceivably be expand-
ed beyond its current constituency of
the JCR, STA Travel, ICU
Newsagents, ICU Shop and the
NatWest cash-point.
Although a general improvement
of student services is undoubtedly
the College's intention, questions
remain as to who might be permitted
to run any new services, where the
profits might go and whether the
expansion of QT and STA will mean
less seating and social space for JCR
patrons. Students and staff alike
await the green light for a badly
