2 seriously injured
This year's Morphy day was held on Oct. 30th, with
minimal police intervention. Freed from last year's restrict-
ing abundance of men in blue, Guilds, Mines and R.C.S.
reverted to the more barbaric form of support for their
respective boat crews, on the long-suffering Putney tow-
path.
Without the restricting influence of the police, the
punch-up produced two people sustaining serious injury.
Paul Gregory, a third year Physicist, was hit in the eye by a
solid object, which broke his glasses, several pieces of which
flew into his eye. He is now in Moorfield Hospital, where,
at the time of writing, it is believed his vision may not
be serously impaired. Another vicfhn required 14 stitches
in his leg.
Notwithstanding such ap-
parently unimportant occur-
rences, the remainder of the
turnout enjoyed themselves
as much as ever, despite the
ruling that participants
should arrive in coaches
meant that people arrived in
small, somewhat bewildered,
groups.
In true tradition
The situation resolved it-
self when the Presidents be-
gan to arrive, and soon there
were two and a half groups
in evidence. Mines and
Guildsfieldedstrong contin-
gents, whilst Gwyn Hughes
found himself Colonel of a
regiment ripe for disband-
ment. When the " custard "
pies had been thrust cere-
moniously into the presiden-
tial physiognomies, Guilds
started the rout of R.C.S.,
who were finished off by a
barrage of potassium per-
manganate bombs from
mines. This performance
was repeated several times
by combatants reluctant to
-call a halt at such an early
stage. A sight to bring tears
BO IS
A HERO
For all the enthusiasts, attendance at the Veteran Car
Clubs's annual London to Brighton run is essential. This
year's run was held on Sunday Nov. 3rd with the inevitable
inclusion of Guilds' Boanerges.
About 20 pyjama-clad Bo to have been beaten by
Guildsmen and women, and
about as many rather more
warmly dressed, gave Bo a
rousing Boomalaka as a
send off. The cold crisp
November air on the way
down to Brighton gave
Dermott " one-again-in-the
news" Corr an excuse to
warm himself with, so it is
said, a complete bottle of
whiskey. Bo was the second
car out of the 231 starters
to arrive in Brighton, and
was almost disqualified for
speeding. However, the
rally is not a race, but it
seems rather disgraceful for
a mere motorised tricycle.
(Shame!) All the same, Bo
did very well to reach
Brighton, as usual, with no
snags at all.
Despite the encourage-
ment of a ducking in the
roundpond in the event of
a failure to reach Brighton,
the drivers are to be con-
gratulated. Once in Brigh-
ton, Bo's supporters, having
arrived by coach (definitely
slower than Bo despite
Guilds' publicity) attended
the celebration dinner at a
certain hotel. The lack of
quality food in the meal was

sporting a disgusting pale
yellow mess on the front of
his coat.
Single file across Putney Bridge
On the way home, the
traditional attempt to find
the harmonic frequency of
Putney Bridge again failed.
By way of consolation, the
assembled company trooped
in single file across a pede-
made up by genuine enthu-
siasm for the day's outing.
R.C.S.'s Jezebel arrived
in 'Brighton mid-morning
in ongnion mia-morning
and was seen displaying a
V.C.C. rally pennant despite
that fact that it is neither
veteran (pre 1905) nor car.
The public loved her, how-
ever, and so, it seems, did
the B.B.C. We are reliably
informed that next year Jez
AN ODE TO MORPHY DA Y
'Twos brillig and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogroves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
(Reproduced without the permission of Lewis Carro
Court at least one lady
commuter was embarrassed
to find that the line of stu-
dents she attempted to fol-
low down an escalator were,
in fact, using the UP side.
Another minor incident oc-
curred when the group
reached South Kensington,
and, despite continued
chanting of his name, Mr.
R. Soles failed to appear.
The Excuse
for it all
The festivities drew to a
close after several successful
circuits of the Albert Hall.
To return to a more mun-
dane point, the result of the
Lowry race was Guilds,
Mines, R.C.S. by 3 and 1J
lengths after R.CS. had
caught two crabs. The Mor-
phy race was a far more ex-
citing event, and was a very
close contest. Mines led at
the start, but appeared to
tire towards the end. With
never more than about one
length between the crews
during the race, the result
was finally R.C.S., Guilds.

pop concert in the Albert

Bo was towed back to
London by trailer at the end
of the day after an extremely
commendable performance.
