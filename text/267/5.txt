HELP FOR
UNMARRIED
MOTHERS
Janet's letter to the Na-
tional Council for the Un-
married Mother and her
Child (NCUMC) was to
bring her new advice on how
to play " cat and mouse "
with the registrar and, after
the inevitable discovery, a
trip to London, a flat, a
grant from the Home Office
and the start of an external
degree course.
7,000 helped
This case was but one
of the 7,000 which the
N C U M C managed to cope
with last year. Unfortu-
nately, this figure has a
double significance. As well
as marking an achievement
it also underlines that there
were 60,065 other mothers
of illegitimate children born
in 1967 who derived no
benefit from the Council.
Expansion
The N C U M C has expan-
ded a great deal since it was
founded in 1918 by a group
of far-sighted women (under
the chairmanship of Mrs.
Lettice Fisher). Now there
is a permanent staff of two
social workers and 20 clerks
and secretaries who some-
how manage to give personal
attention to the 400 or so
letters they receive every
day. They have a hard-
working and enthusiastic
General Secretary, Mrs.
Margaret Brammel, who de-
votes days and often nights
to the administration of this
complex service. She also
gives lectures and makes
personal appearances for
funds.
The rapid expansion of
the N C U M C has been ac-
companied by an equally
rapid increase in the services
it provides. Broadly speak-
ing, these services can be
divided into two categories
services which apply to the
individual and work aimed
at improving the lot of
" bastards " in general.
Legal Rights
In the first case, the
N C U M C acts primarily as a
means of putting expectant
mothers in touch with their
local social worker. If this
proves impossible, as in the
case of Janet Chadwick, the
woman is brought to Lon-
don and taken under the
wing of the Association it-
self, which then sees to her
needs as far as it possibly
can. In addition, advice is
given on such things as the
legal rights of the mother
and her child and ways of
obtaining money in the form
of grants from numerous
trust funds.
Legal Reforms
The second function re-
fers to the NCUMC's role
as a pressure group, which
attempts to bring about le-
gislative reform. At the
moment, a bill is being
sought to provide equality
of inheritance rights for ille-
gitimate children. The recent
abolition of the Limits to
Maintenance Order was in
part due to the N C U M C .
Tragically, the merit of
this organisation is not
widely enough realised for it
to get the support it needs
and surely deserves. To con-
tinue its work, the Council
had to dig deeper and
deeper into its resources
which are now exhausted.
At this time of crisis, the
students of IC have been
sufficiently moved by its
appeals to choose the
N C U M C for their Carnival
Charity. In so doing, we
have made ourselves respon-
sible for its financial salva-
tion. Let us hope that we
do not fail them.

SORTING
OUT
HORNSEY
A motley collection of students stood in the cold
outside Tottenham Palace Cinema (N.16 or somewhere).
S O L I D A R I T Y , S T U D E N T SUPPORT F O R H O R N S E Y ,
said a poster. " Never done a day's work," said a passing
middle-aged woman.
Expressing solidarity were miscellaneous students, in-
cluding T W O from IC. The three broadsheets around gave
the ghastly facts about Hornsey as had been revealed
yesterday when the College resumed (?) functioning (?)
after an unexplained six week delay.
The freshers looked bewil-
dered by it all.
Lord Longford
Inside, the 800-strong
meeting of staff, students and
governors was mostly or-
derly; everybody listened to
Lord Longford, chairman of
the commission to " sort-
out " Hornsey. He said no-
thing would work without
goodwill and that the go-
vernors must re-admit the
24 sacked students (unfairly
sacked was the case, accord-
ing to a new staff member to
whom I spoke afterwards).
Governing Body
Many people spoke, even
members of the governing
body spoke—and revealed
themselves to be reactionary,
clumsy and stupid. The
chairman of the governing
body, Alderman Boins was
unable to give any assuran-
ces concerning the 24 stu-
dents or about the propo-
sition that there should be 7
rather than 2 students on

student said despite the fact
the college was " open " he
was unable to work while
his mind was sickened by
the general atmosphere of
badwill.
MORADE
The meeting closed at
4.15. People stood around
discussing in groups outside
the cinema; one man wanted
everyone to join the " yel-
low revolution" (referring to
cowards). People drifted
away, wondering what the
governors will decide on
Friday, wondering what the
M O R A D E (Movement of
Re-thinking Art and Design
Education) would do, won-
dering which College will
next finance members (Staff
Students) of Hornsey Col-
lege of Art and wondering if
M O R A D E will get any
money from similar sources
after its coming emergency
meeting on Saturday.
C o n c e s s i o n s
for
Students
The External Affairs
Committee is working on
travel concessions and shop
discounts for students. Any-
one with information about
shops in London which pro-
vide discounts should let
Dave Cooper know via the
External Affairs rack in the
Union Office. A list will be
published as soon as pos-
sible and certainly before the
end of term.
Queries
On travel, general litera-
ture and information on
concessions will be available
in the Union reading room
at the beginning of the
Spring term. People with
queries this term should en-
quire in the Union office or
see Pam, the Union recep-
tionist.
MR
I C W A
Five chivalrous gentlemen
offered their knees to ICWA
last Tuesday week in the
election for Mr. ICWA. The
candidates and their propo-
sers, all well lubricated, pro-
vided considerable enter-
tainment.
The first to take the floor
—literally—was a mini-
shorted fig-leafed Keith
Rowan. Martin Moyes
made the offering of a dead
Rowan to I C W A saying he
would obviously have more
time this way. " Jules "
Brownridge had not come as
prepared but at the clarion
call of " knees," not wish-
ing to deprive ICWA of the
sight of his knobbly leg
joints, Jules calmly dropped
his trousers.
Next was John Noakes
whose assets included
beardophilia which has
spread to his knees and a
keen interest in geology and
prospecting. Then came
Roger Guy with statistics
7-8-7| and lastly an oratori-
cal C- Parker proposed
Dermott Corr, mentioning
his corrage, esprit-de Corr
and Corr Anglais(?).
ICWA was allowed a last
ogle at all ten hairy knobbly
knees before voting. In spite
of all the Corrn littered
around by C- they chose
Dermott as their champion.
Congratulations and good
luck to him.
All problems should be addressed to, Aunt Vera, c/o FELIX,
Union Letter Rack, or via internal mail.
Dear Aunt Vera,
As a last resort I have decided to write to you about
my problem. I find I have an unaccountable attraction for
a member of the staff.
How can I get him to really notice me? I am getting
dcsoeratc^-PLEASE Jielrj mc.
Yours in anticipation,
Miss X , squared
Dear Miss X squared,
Your first task is to get noticed by making sure he
knows your first name. Go to lectures dressed as if for an
evening out and cultivate the habit of after-lecture chats
trying to steer the conversation around to non-academic
topics. I suggest also that you stand as close to him as you
dare, touching him if possible. You know, if us girls want
emancipation we must sometimes be prepared to make the
first move.
However you must remember that it is not generally
accepted for staff to go out with students and this may be
inhibiting him.
I wish you the best of luck and will be only too pleased
to hear from you again.
AUNT VERA
Dear Aunt Vera,
I am a third year student leading a reasonably happy
and balanced life. However, I have a phobia about
crowded rooms: I am overpowered by the Standard
Student Stench (S cubed) to be found in refectories. Union
meetings, lectures, etc. For instance, I have to gulp my
food, with all inherent risks, for fear of an armpit stretching
for salt across my plate; I have nightmares of votes being
counted, so that my participation in Union meetings is
minimal; I am tempted to miss lectures.
Not wishing to become a total academic and social
wreck, can you please give the student mass some helpful
advice?
Desperately,
NOSTRILS
P.S. I use all the standard safeguards, so it can't be me.
Dear Nostrils,
Here in your name is the problem and the answer. You
have an over-sensitive nose. Next vacation job, try the
sewage department (R.S.M.?) I think you are painting
things browner than they smell and remember, a fox
ALWAYS smells his own hole first.
Yours aromatically,
AUNT VERA
Unsatisfied—Use " Fyffes Jamaican Long "—Try the firm
Fortnum and Mason's.
Anxious—In your drunken state you couldn't have come
anyway.
