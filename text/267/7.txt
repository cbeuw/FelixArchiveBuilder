INCREDIBLES IN CONCERT
FELIX 13 November 1968 7
KEEF'S KORNER
Have you ever been to
one of those concerts where
you enjoyed it? The in-
song to end so that you
could show just how much
you enjoyed i t? The in-
credible String Band's per-
formance at the Albert Hall
(Nov. 2nd) was definitely in
this category.
Two Scotsmen, Robin
Williamson and Mike Heron
make up " The Band," and
have developed a unique
musical style in the present
world of lalalalaing Treme-
loes and Bicycletteing Engl-
berts. A l l their songs are
self-penned; Robin's, deep
to the extent of being ob-
scure, the tunes heavy with
the mystery of the medieval
" lute and sackbut" era
and Mike's, much happier
usually .based on West In-
dian rhythms. Assisted by
their girl friends Liquorice
and Rose (surely the cutest
female around) they worked
their way through a huge
pile of instruments on the
stage ranging from a whin-
ing, three-stringed violin
contraption down to a hum-
ble tea-chest—the latter
being used as a bass drum
(in case you were per-
plexed! ) Most of the num-
bers were from their new
double album " Wee Tam
and the Big Huge" and
were for most part in the
style of their previous re-
cords.
However, after the inter-
val came a break from the
String Band tradition with a
real rootin' tootin' country
and western number, fiddles
and all.
The finale was a poem
(unintelligible unfortunately)
set to music. During its
performance, the company
was swelled by assorted
dance-mime characters in
eluding Neptune and several
nebulous nymphs. When
the show ended, the audi
ence clapped hands, stomped
feet . . . etc. for a full five
minutes but to no avail. The
only result was to have two
more glimpses of the wierdy
dancers. Rather a let-down
after an original, ovei
whelming, incredible con-
cert.

Having been called I C s John Peel in my last article,
I am hoping for a similar honour to his. He was voted
most popular DJ by Melody Maker readers; maybe F E L I X
readers will vote me most boring columnist of the year.
Colcutt's inane attack on disciplined performance of
Ents in the last issue could
hardly have been worse
timed, coming out a few
days after one of the best
shows Ents (or anyone) has
put on at IC since I have
been here. The Pink Floyd
must surely be one of the
best groups in Britain at
present and they were on
top form with their superb
audio and visual act at IC,
winning round an initially
cool and sceptical audience.
Once or twice they lost co-
hesion but for most of the
time we heard a remarkably
music which would just
sound nothing but gim-
mickry played by almost
anyone else, but which in
their hands pushes back the
frontiers of contemporary
music a little further.
For the rest of this term
Ents have, for our delight,
booked the Idle Race for
this Saturday (16th), the
Action for 30th November
and Barclay James Harvest
for 7th December.
Have you discovered
Kensington Market yet? It
is situated on Kensington
High Street, just before you
come to Barkers, about 10
minutes' walk from the Col-
lege. Here you will find
stalls and boutiques selling
clothes (for both sexes but
mostly women's), antiques,
oriental goods, chemists
supplies, magazines, posters,
records and lots of other as*
sorted junk.
Not only is the Market a
good place for some surrep-
titious ogling but here are
many things worth buying,
too. Some of the clothes are
good value, many trinkets
are reasonably priced, there
are two stalls selling brand
new LPs for about 30/-
(against 36/'- to 39/- nor-
mally) and there is a stall
offering a large variety of
psychedelic posters (just
the job to brighten up your
dull room) and probably the
best selection of Under-
ground magazines outside
the Arts Lab.
One of these magazines
which is especially worth
mentioning is Time Out, a
sort of psychedelic What's
On, which gives details of
jazz, folk and pop concerts
films, records, drama, off
beat shops, demonstrations
and much more useful infor-
mation. It is run by the
people who produced Unit
Keele University's unofficial
version of Phoenix and pro
bably the best student maga
zine in the country. Time
C'Jt costs 1/6 and comes out
every three weeks; the next
issue is due out on 21st
November. If anyone wants
to publicise events to
wider audience than just in-
side IC, Time Out is worth
contacting. The address is
24. St George's Court
Gloucester Road, S.W.7

At the beginning of this term it was my expressed
intention to review only those films which were of particu-
lar interest to F E L I X readers, or which might escape the
review columns of the national press. It was in deference
to this principle that I sucked in cheap cigar smoke for
two and a half hours amidst an audience, for the most part
drunk or frustrated—or both—and watched the Cameo-
Royal's late show on Saturday which just happened to be
a new Swedish film called " I, a Woman " ( X X X X X X X ! ) .
It's difficult to criticise this film from the point of
view of artistry, or good direction, or even an enthralling
plot. This does not mean that the film is either beyond
criticism or that it contains no art—in its honest exposition
of the body of its young (female) star, it features what can
only be described as a simply beautiful piece of art! But
it is certainly not a director's film and has a pretty shallow
Story.
If you are going to make a film about what the dic-
tionary calls " morbid sexual desire," then you must show
its various manifestations as and how they happen. The
climate of sexual emancipation in Sweden is such that this
can be done without fear of censorship. The management
of the Cameo Cinemas is such that they can get away with
it. It's not pornography—really, it's eroticism and honesty.
It's also great to watch (let's be honest, chaps) and it's
fascinating if you're fascinated by sexual aberrations. It's
completely artless however, and, if you are a domesticated,
righteous, stable, straightforward, contented, happy, house-
trained hard-worker I should stick to your problem sheets
and your Mrs. Whitehouse mailing list. Need I say more?
If nudity be a feature of "I, a Woman" it forms part of
the continuity of" The Swimmer " (A) (Columbia) in which
Burt Lancaster's entire wardrobe consists Of a pair of
swimming trunks.
SWEDISH CINEMA or WHERE TO GO ON
A SATURDAY NIGHT AFTER AN ABOR-
TIVE I.C. HOP?
Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) is a man. One cannot
further qualify this vacuous statement since one is not
afforded the usual information of background—he emerges
from the woods—or class—everyone wears bathing trunks!
So we are immediately presented with a mystery which, it
seems, will be resolved for us by the rest of the film. What
is obvious from the start, however, is that this man is, at
best, an aesthete and, at worst, a misfit. With sun-tanned
body and well-groomed physique he stands apart from the
paunchy hedonistic friends who are the inhabitants of the
rich, pretentious American Urban suburb whose founda-
tion is not a culture or even a cult but the alumino-plastic
bottom of unused but status-gaining swimming pools.
O.K. so this is a sort of mature drop-out—nothing to
make a film about, especially when his relationship with
those whom you would expect to despise him—i.e. the
pool-patio dwellers—is a very warm one. Ned then decides
to swim home to his own house—where, he repeats,
Lucinda (his wife) is fine and the girls (who adore him) are
playing tennis—via the trail of swimming pools which mark
the route. The aghast stares and exhortations of his un-
comprehending friends are all expected as is the admiration
we feel for this man in his love of nature and pursuit of
physical fulfilment. The trail home, however, is the theme
of the film which portrays Ned's physical decline from a
manificent climax where he paces a racing stallion in full
flight. With his depletation of strength comes a degradation
of character at the hands of successive pool-owners
who, from the grocer's wife who reminds him of his unpaid
bills to the young starlet who taunts him with his super-
cilious duplicity in an old love-affair, ring upon him frag-
ments of realisation which serve to quench the fire with
which he started his heroic venture. The not-unexpected
though totally inconclusive ending falls not far short of
tragedy in the best theatrical tradition.
P.S. It must be said—" Barbarella " is an awful film!

P H O E N I X
Last week, Felix Ace Reporter Bernard Foon visited Phoenix
editor John Mullaly in his luxury London flat. Phoenix is
I.C.'s own arts magazine; and witty, articulate Mullaly a
former Felix staff man and regular contributor.
Settling comfortably into
one of his massive arm-
chairs, I asked John about
his general aims for Phoe-
nix, as the magazine has
been widely ignored in the
past. He believes it should
be in complete contrast to
EC's rigidly technological
atmosphere, while springing
from it.
Phoenix should play a
larger part in I.C. life," he
said, offering me one of his
Mended Balkan cigarettes.
" 1 want it to become some-
thing that everybody will
want to read, and contribute
to."
In short, he is after that
elusive thing—involvement.
Previous editors have pro-
bably started off with much
the same ideas.
Mixing himself a double
Bacardi and Coke, John put
forward his plans for the
year's first issue, which
comes out in January. Be-
sides pieces on more general
topics this will include a
revolutionary self-contained
section with a central theme.
Did he have such a theme in
mind?
" Time. Have you been
walking round with your
eyes shut?" The centre
section will include any
available art form : prose,
poetry, photographs, line
art work, experimental lay-
out, and the use of colour;
and the theme can be inter-
preted as widely as possible.
John is looking for contri-
butions in any art form and
on any subject, but particu-
larly on the theme of
" time."
As I left, John was pour-1
ing himselt another Bacardi,
ready for a long evening at
the typewriter.
" If Phoenix looks good,"
he called through the Porta-
phone, " we hope to distri-
bute it throughout London."
Today London, tomorrow
—the world. With this
amazing man you never can
tell.
You can contact John
Mullaly through the Plvoenix
letter rack m the Union.
P H O E N I X
PHOENIX requests and requ-
ires contributions; prose, poet
ry, photography, and artwork,
on the theme TIME. The the-
me is not exclusive. Contribu-
tions of any form, about
anything you wish are equally
welcome. Whichever you deci-
de, send your work to John
Mullaly by the Union Rack,
or Martin Moyes, 56 Beit.
