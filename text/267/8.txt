What with the 1st X V still finding wins elusive, the
Badminton team taking a hammering, and the golfers on
the verge of destitution, we seem to have come to a low spot
in I.C. sport this week.
However on the credit side we have the Cross-Country
Club doing well. Also the 1st X I (Soccer) finally pulling
their fingers out and beating Q.E.C. 11-2 on Saturday, and
the lady fencers won their first match against Kings 5-4
thanks to Herculean efforts by Rebecca Winnall.
In the near future students may be used as barmen at
Harlington in order to cut costs. If anyone is interested
in being a barman, especially if they play regularly at Har-
lington, please contact Bob Pine or their captain.
MOrtPHY DAY
--THE R A C E S
The Morphy and Lowry
races were held as usual on
a Wednesday afternoon
soon after the beginning of
the Winter term and always
provide a good guide to the
standard of rowing which
can be expected during the
next season. spectators
ought not to hav; been dis-
appointed with th; racing, in
particular the Morphy race,
for the college first boats
provided a spectacular
finish.
The Lowry race, after one
bad start due mainly to
over enthusiastic coxing,
finally got away to a fair
start and Guilds were
pressed hard by the other
crews up to the halfway
point; after this however
they could afford to -elax
and eventually won by two
to three lengths over Mines
and R.C.S.
The Morphy race pro-
vided the highspot of a cold
deary afternoon when all
three crews began the last
stretch of the course with
only | l £ lengths separating
them. Up until the Black
Buoy, Mines and Guilds had
been contesting the lead,
with R.C.S. trailing by
about i length, but at this
R.C.S. spurted and drew
level. For the last minute
Guilds clung to a marginal
lead until the final 20
strokes of the race, when
R.C.S. with a magnificent
finish managed to draw
ahead and win by a canvas.
Coxing played a larse part
in the winning of this race
with each crew at some
point striving for the fastest
Water, and it is unfortunate
that there is no perfectly
even course close at hand
GOLFERS SOON TO
BE HOMELESS?
The standard of Golf at
I.C. on the competitive level
has been exceedingly b'gh so
far this year. The College
Team has consisted of six
single figure handicap men
in both our matches so far.
The results in these matches
were very close but boih
came out in favour of I.C.
In the first match against
Portsmouth " College of
Technology, which was
played at Wankley Common
Golf Club, the College won
by 3^ matches to 2\, and in
the second, played at Hen-
don Golf Club against the
University of Kent, the re-
sult was 4 matches to 2.
The rest of the College
Golf Club have been paying
regular visits to Hendon
Golf Club to which we are
affiliated. Unfortunately the
Committee at Hendon Golf
Club has decided to termi-
nate our agreement with
them on the 31st of Decem-
ber this year. That means
that the Golf Club is now
homeless.
This problem will be dis-
cussed at an Extraordinary
General Meeting of the Club
to be held at 1.00 p.m.
Thursday 14th November
in Committee Room A .
Could all those interested in
the future of Golf at I.C.
please try to come along to
this meeting.

BADMINTON
DISASTER
The first team lost their
first league match of the
season last Wednesday be
ing beaten 8—1 by West
Ham at Nine Elms Baths.
This brought to sudden end
the good run the first te^m
had been enjoying, having
beaten Queen Mary College
2nds 8—1 and Chelsea 9—0.
The other teams have little
success in the 2nd division
and should perhaps draw in-
spiration from the Ladies
Mixed teams which are as
yet undefeated.
The Ladies team has
beaten Chelsea 5—4, and the
mixed team have beaten N .
Polytechnic 6-3, and Queen
Mary College, (last year's
mixed champions) also by
6—3.
HOCKEY
NEWS
Weather has badly hit this
term's programme to date.
The 1st X I has been lucky
and played 3 games in the
last fortnight. They beat the
Royal Free Hospital 2—0;
however, this was not a fair
reflection on the College's
superiority. The lack of
goals was due to two things:
a bad pitch and bad shoot-
ing. Against St. Edmund's
Hall, Oxford, the College
was again superior but failed
to score and they this time
paid the penalty. After
taking the lead through a
short corner by M . G . Burt,,
St. Edmund's equalised
shortly before time.
Against Epsom, the 1st
X I was completely at sea.
Admittedly the pitch was
extremely slippery after
heavy rain, but Epsom
showed how the game
should be played under such
conditions and they were
unlucky in not being two
goals up in the first five
minutes. Their persistence
was rewarded by goals-
three in fact by half-time.
After the turn-round the
College came more into the
game and managed to score
through Mudan, the final
score being 3—1.
The 2nd, 3rd and 4th XIs
have all done well to hold
their opponents from Dul-
wich to draws. However,
the 3rd and 4ths were as-
sisted by one or two mem-
bers from the 1st X I , whose
game was cancelled.
S T E V E H I L L
FLABBY DISPLAY
FROM 1st XI
I.C. \st XI 1. Kings \st
XI 1.
In conditions unsuitable
for good football IC enter-
tained Kings, their old
rivals from previous en-
counters.
IC opened strongly with
constant attacks, and within
the first few minutes should
have been one up. This pat-
tern continued for most of
the first half, creating at
least four good chances,
which should have given
them a good lead at half
time. However, due to very
slack finishing IC did not
manage to score. After
about thirty minutes, Kings
were allowed to take the
lead following a bad mix-up
in the IC defence. IC con-
tinued to have most of the
play and Dave King was un-
lucky not to score with a
fine shot which scraped the
post.
The second half was
rather disappointing. IC
seemed to lack drive and
punch for long periods, and
did not really look like re-
covering. It was a great
relief when, towards the end
of the game, Tony Richards
levelled the score with a lob
into the corner of the net.
On the whole it was a ra-
ther flabby display and a
greater sense of urgency is
needed, especially inside the
box.
The third team continued
their winning streak, with a
2—1 victory over Q.M.C.
thirds.

I.C. LEADS IN
LONDON LEAGUE
After a very exciting race
at Borough Road last Wed-
nesday I.C. moved into the
lead on the London Col-
leges Cross-Country League.
The race was held over a
course of 4 miles and after
a fast start the field settled
down with Norman Morri-
son of I.C. taking over the
lead and going on to win
over half a .linute. A l l of
I.C.'s first team packed into
the first twenty and the se-
cond team packed between
twentieth and fortieth, thus
moving into sixth position.
No mean achievement con-
sidering the thirty teams
taking part.
The previous Saturday
had seen 9 I.C. runners
competing for U.L. against
Cambridge and although
Cambridge won the first
team match London won the
second, third and fourth
team struggles. Next week
sees us running against Ox-
ford *

I.C. BEAT
BELGIANS
AGAIN
IC Ist XV 19 pts.
Belgian National XV 3 pts.
Last Sunday, Nov. 3rd,
this most enjoyable game
was played in cold windy
weather but on a remarkably
good pitch, thanks to
Arthur Loveday and his
staff.
IC first played the Bel-
gians last Easter on tour,
when the score was 16 pts.
to 3 pts. to IC, and so the
Belgians were keen for re-
venge.
IC played badly for most
of the first half, into the
wind, and only towards half-
time did they look at all
convincing when, from an
orthodox passing movement,
John Kelly (IC's guest
player) put Keith Heaton
away for a try. Bob Pine
failed to convert.
3 pts. to 0 was to be the
half-time score with IC
threatening to play well.
With the wind behind
them IC were unaccountably
slow starters in the second
half, but gradually the tries
began to come. With John
Ballard back after injury,
the midfield trio of Ballard,
Kelly and Pine caused con-
siderable trouble and scored
three times between them.
However, one particularly
remembers the mercurial
agility and incredible burst
of speed shown by Barry
Sullivan when creating a
beautiful opening to put
Bob Pine clear.
The final score of 19—3
was a good and just one for
IC who had played for most,
of the match without Andy
Vickerstaff who had a dam-
aged eye.
The Belgians never gave
up but their tackling, at
times worse even than IC's
sadly let them down;
they did however deserve
their late try scored by Jean-
Pierre Vachaudez.
