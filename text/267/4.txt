4 FELIX 13 November 1968
I see that I C U Exec have officially described Morphy
Day as successful! I wonder whether the two lads who
ended up in hospital—one with ia 14-stitch leg wound
caused by cave-man-like antics of his fellow students
and the other whose sight has been seriously impaired
by broken glass would agree. Over the October 17th de-
monstration I C U Exec rightly took the line that violence,
even in this cause, was to be condemned. Then what is the
reasoning behind the laying-on of coaches to send people
to engage in this primitive orgy on the banks of the
Thames.
In theory, Morphy Day sounds a fine chance for students
to let off steam by pelting each other with rotten vegetables.
But those who've gone know how it always works out in
practice—damage to property, inconvenience to the public
and injuries caused by still-solid turnips, apples and even
stones and broken glass.
If IC Exec is too cowardly to condemn this anachro-
nistic rioting perhaps they will refrain from giving it their
official blessing and wasting Union funds to hire coaches to
beguile Freshers to Putney.
Forget about the mess of Morphy Day, let it rot among
the stinking garbage on the Thames towpath. Forget about
following your leader and playing childish games that are
too rough for you—think about following yourself.
The mass of mediocrity that is IC displays such an
appalling lack of individuality that I am tempted at times
to stand up and count the sheep. Are you all af raid of your
own personalities and potential? Surely College is the
place to find and display and experiment with your free-
dom. L O O K A T Y O U R S E L F , your diminutive soul nest-
ling in your pretentious shell which has been formed by
society and you. Now, L O O K A T E V E R Y O N E ELSE.
Are you the same? Are you?
Have you ever sat in the quad with an anemone in
your mouth crying, have you ever plucked an icicle from
the foot of an irate polar bear, have you ever talked about
"Thee" with Conrad Akin i at his Cape Cod summer home,
have you ever sat in your mud-spattered white Jensen with
a beautiful blonde, listening to a Bach fugue on your radio
and lighting your Gauloise with a match struck on your
faded Levis?
Be a get-away man. Fly to your own Hungerford
Bridge to see your own porpoises. Be your own Kelloggs'
cornflake floating in your own bowl, taking your own
movies.
I love the Royal Albert Hall and I love shuffling through
Autumn leaves because the nice thing about them is that
they don't fight back. I love fireworks and I love snow
and I love eyes and I love floating hair and I love orange
juice and I love Newcastle Brown. I love England's Glory
matches and I love cold streams and cold North winds
stirring up my duffel coat and I love stone urns and I love
writing drivel with everyone else on F E L I X to help me.
What do you love?
And, besides, what the hell is a bourgeois bum like you
doing here anyway???

Drunks & Demonstrators
Dear Sir,
All of us, including Viet-
nam demonstrators abhor
drunkenness especially when
accompanied by vandalistic
action. But I think it is in-
tellectually dishonest to
equate actions of demon-
strators with those of a
drunken lot.
In using your sixth sense
to decide the outcome of the
October 27 demonstrations,
you were following the noble
traditions of Fleet Street
where unfounded and un-
supported subjectivities pass
for critical comment, and
events that do not lit a pre-
conceived pattern are NON-
E V E N T S .
Your friend of Fleet
Street and you still have to
tell the public what happened
to all those expjpsives and
guns that could have been
used against peace-loving
Londoners. Since they were
never used, they must be
somewhere. Surely our ex-
cellent bobbies can find
them or have they willed
these things to exist no
more?
Finally, it may interest
your readers to know that
the same sort of people who
wantonly destroy Union
property, object to demon-
strations because "they de-
generate into anarchy." Let
us. therefore, not run them
down too hard. In addition
to loving the battle, they
also love law and order,
peace and democracy. Union
property is not the only
thing they love to smash,
they also love to jeer at
demonstrators who after all
are desecrators of all we
hold dear.

Squash Courts — Reply
Dear Sir.
I feel it is mv duty to
reply to Mr. Phillips's letter
to you in the last issue of
F E L I X , re Squash Court
and staff usage.
At the last meeting of the
Sports Centre steering Com-
mittee held on 7th October,
the Rector reported that the
Governors took the view
that if there were to be un-
restricted staff and student
usage of the four courts dur-
ingTerm, students might fre-
quently find themselves un-
able to play because of staff
bookings. They therefore
suggested to the Committee
that, at least initially, staff
should only be able to book
the courts during vacations.
The Committee, on which
the staff were represented,
accepted this arrangement,
although as with other rules
for the Sports Centre, it is
subject to review by the new
South Kensington Sports
Committee in the light of
experience. Staff may play
as guests during term-time
and life members of the
Union as well as ordinary
members are allowed to
book the courts.

Mandate
The statement SENNET
PROTEST, signed I.C. Ex-
ecutive Committee, (makes
propositions beyond the
mandate of the Union gene-
ral meeting which passed
the original motion of pro-
test.
It is stated that: this week
(Oct. 23)'s issue of Sennet
contains incitement to vio-
lence. This claim is ground-
less and probably libellous.
This is followed by an un-
balanced attack on Sennet
itself. We ask : Do the six
members of IC Exec con-
sider themselves more rep-
resentative of "a vast section
of London University stu-
dents " than the editor of
Sennet, whose appointment
is controlled by U L U ?
We hope that during the
coming year IC Exec will
arrange for publicity of the
decisions which they are
mandated to take as widely
as appears to be their per-
sonal opinion on the Sennet
issue.
We note with interest the
closing paragraph of the
statement where they sup-
port the principle of re-
view of Officers who act be-
yond their mandate.

. Subtle (or Subtile?)
Sir.
In view of the casualties
of this year's Morphy Day,
and the number of people
who went because they felt
they had an obligation to
go, like the Constituent Col-
lege officials, one asks one-
self : what is the point of
the towpath battle? Good
fun? But who enjoys such
hooliganism? Release of
various stresses imposed on
us by academic life. But the
Union provides other such
opportunities for this. So
why should we go down to
Putney every year, turn the
place into a horrible mess,
and end up with a fellow
student who could possibly
end up losing an eye, and
another one with 14 stitches
in his leg. I think, and am
sure that the majority of the
people in this Union agree
with me, that in future we
go down there actually to
watch the races and not to
try and viciously molest
each other to the extreme.
Yours etc.,
G E O R G E ASSIMAKIS
Floor Rep IC Council.
Sir,
As the author of the
broadsheet complained
about by Andrew Stewart in
your last issue, I also de-
plore the level of literacy in
the College. Mr. Stewart will
find that the only way to im-
prove his standard is to buy
himself a dictionary, to sup-
plement his Fowler. How-
ever as he chose to rush into
print I should like to quote
from the latest edition of the
Complete Oxford English
Dictionary. The 5th mean-
ing of Subtile, as opposed to
Subtle, given there reads:
" involving careful discrimi-
nation." The references the
dictionary follows this by,
show that, in the context of
the sentences I used it in, it
is a more correct word to
use than subtle.
I would therefore advise
Mr. Stewart to take a little
more care before he gives
full rein to his natural indig-
nation.
Yours faithfully,

BOOK REVIEWS
THE ANXIETY MAKERS
by ALEX COMFORT 8/6
Reproduction, masturba*
tion, constipation and con-
traception are matters which
concern most of us at some
time in our lives. Dr. Alex
Comfort, in this amusing
book, gives a brief history
of the medical and pseudo-
medical attitudes to these
and similar matters. He is
a mine of fascinating, if
sometimes irrelevant,; infor-
mation, e.g. prostitution was
a reserved occupation dur-
ing World War II, but his
main theme is serious, that
there will always be a divi-
sion between the liberals and
the traditionalists on matters
of this kind. He illustrates
his point not only with his-
torical examples but with
modern issues such as organ
transplants and the teaching
of autistic children. Not only
is this an enjoyable book
to read : it also makes you
think.
WHAT KIND OF
REVOLUTION?
A Christian-Communist dio-
logue,
edited by James Klugman
and Paul Oestreicher, 6/-.
Christianity and Marxism
are the two ideologies which
have had most effect on
civilisation as it exists today.
These essays by British
holders of both creeds reveal
how much common ground
there is while accepting the
still great differences. A l l
the writers accept that the
The first four books in the new Panther Modern Society
series cover a broad field. Three are reviewed below and the
fourth, 'La Vida' by Oscar Lewis will be covered later.
popular images of both ideo-
logies are false, mainly be-
cause of distortion in the
practices of their advocates,
and much emphasis is laid
on recognising basic be-
liefs. The other aspect of
the dialogue is social doc-
trine, for starting either
from the idea of an ideal
society or from the belief
that each individual is made
in the image of God, a con-
demnation of war, poverty,
and racial prejudice can be
reached. Whether violence
should be used and how im-
portant the individual per-
son is in attaining ideals are
practical issues discussed at
length. As a Christian, I feel
that every Christian should
find in this book a stimulus
to consider the social impli-
cations of his faith and, I
believe, every Marxist may
perhaps gain some idea of
the sanctity of the indivi-
dual.
GOING HOME
byDORIS LESSING
In a reprint of a 10 year-old
book, the author, a Commu-
nist, describes a return to
Rhodesia at the time of the
Federation. This interesting
situation leads to an ambiva-
lence wholly good for her
writing. The book contains
many personal conversations
with all shades of white opi-
nion. It is also a celebration
of the landscape and of early
effort in building the party.
