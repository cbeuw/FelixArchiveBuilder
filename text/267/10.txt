The-public turned out in large numbers last Saturday for the first street collection
of the year, which also doubled as the Lord Mayor*s Show.
Twenty-two R.C.S. m
e
n collected, around St. Pauls, while a similar number of
Guildsmen sold about 1,000 Official programmes. C
&
G Union had provided 1+ girls to grace
the Deep Sea Tramp Fleet Float, and one maharajah for the P&0 Line. From the back seat
of Bo, parked on Ludgate Hill, Dermott Corr passed suitable comments on the floats,
taught the Lord Mayor the words of the Boomalaka, and invited numerous belles to 158,
Falmouth Hall. Later on Guilds also started collecting money. .
Despite a chill wind, lack of organisation, and very poor I.C. turnout,\Carnival
benefited by at least £50, half a dollar and one fruit machine token.
The Carnival treasurer has reported that the collection at the Lord Mayor's S
h
o
w
last Saturday brought in £59-4-Id. C
&
G collected £15-6-9d, R.C.S. £L3-l?~4d.
As the turnover of the Charity Carnival is n
o
w very high it has become necessary
to comply with, or at least break less flagrantly, the law. Consequently a m
u
c
h closer
control is being kept on collecting tins, each of which is n
o
w numbered. Would the
possessors of tins 8, 83, 93 and 98 please return these to the Carnival Office as soon
as possible.

collapse. Still, w

Last Friday Linstead flail had its first party.
It was a great success and praise must be given
to the organisers for their ability in producing
females. Entertainment included the Precious
