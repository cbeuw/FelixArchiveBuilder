THEY TELL ME..
FELIX 13 November 1968 3
Linstead Dinner
Father Ivor Smith-Came-
ron, the Anglican Chaplain,
is a well known figure on
the IC scene and a notable
tireless worker for the
Church. Over 750 students
received invitations from
him to the only staff-student
service of the year, the
Commem Day Service in
Holy Trinity Church. At-
tendance by students was
surprisingly good but attend-
dance by staff was pitiful.
Ivor rails staff
In response to their invita-
tions staff offered excuses.
About two turned up to join
Lord and Lady Penney and
Lord and Lady Sherfield in
the front three rows. Ivor
called this a scandal and
suggested the staff were
" paid for talking a lot and
doing nothing." He would
wait and see whether staff
turned up to meet the
Bishop of Kensington on the
20th November and came to
the confirmation service in
Mech Eng foyer at 7.0 p.m.
on November 19th, before
he passed judgement on
their sincerity in the drive to
improve staff-student rela-
tions.
Attendance apart, IC is
now very backward in the
planning of Commem Day
services. The speakers are
chosen by the College au-
thorities without consulting
student religious leaders
who meet in the " Holy
Huddle." Consequently the
authorities prefer Bishops,
who deliver sermons of tech-
nical merit, but not as re-
lated to everyday life as the
occasion demands. The sys-
tem also tends to compro-
mise student ecumenism. A
reform in the present pro-
cedure would make a suit-
able topic for discussion in
the Joint Union Rectors Go-
vernors Committee ( J U R G O ) .
Sennet
People who have counted
up the cost of the 50 glasses
broken in the Union Bar
during an infamous Fre-
shers' Dinner might be
tempted to guess that disci-
pline was the main thought
occupying the minds of ICU
Exec. Not a bit of it; they
are pondering the extra-
ordinary blunder forced on
them by a group of people
who issued a libellous
statement about " Sennet "
in the name of IC Exec.
Leaving aside the ethics
of the group, who sent out
5000 copies of their state-
ment all over London, one
important question is raised.
If John Shields, Helen
Rudge and Co. disapprove
so strongly of the bias in
Sennef let them get off their
backsides and write for
the paper. Sennet, like
F E L I X , is dependent on
people foolhardy enough to
risk exam failure working
for it and both papers
readily accept offers of help.
But of course it is easier to
knock people, even to waste
£7 13s. of Union money to
challenge the freedom of the
press, than to do something
constructive oneself.
Hapless G.
Spare a thought this week
for hapless George Assi-
makis.
The friendly floor rep we
all know and love has re-
ceived a couple of nasty
blows from the Union bu-
reaucracy when wearing two
of his other disguises.

on trial
The honeymoon period of
the exec and King Rex is
over. Council, that ineffec-
tive, bureaucratic, auto-
nomy, full of its own glory
procreates subcommittees
to prove its own virility,
despite ever increasing evi-
dence of its senility.
Out of touch
The Presidential Palace in
Prince's Gardens, (" I did it
for the good of the Union ")
and £400 spent on the Pre-
sident's Ball are evidence
that council, which holds the
purse strings, is out of touch
with the grass roots of the
Union and that " Communi-
cate " is just a sop to let
democracy be seen to be
done, but never actually
done.

Secondly Jane Pearson
sends George in a flat spin
over some urgent letters to
overseas students from Mr.
McDowall. Our Greek hero

Overseas Students Clubs

is chairman, from SCC to

Welfare Committee. There-
fore George takes his dupli-
cating to Janet in the Union
Office but Jane, ever anx-
ious to keep Janet sweet,
tells George he's still a club
chairman and must use the
bookstall until Welfare
Committee accept him. The
very next day Welfare do
vote George in and back he
returns to the Union Office.
However, Jane informs him
that he must hand the letters
to Rob Collinge, to hand to
Janet, and in any case Rob
Collinge can't do that until
Council ratifies Welfare's
decision. LES EBDON
Linstead Hall opening
dinner was held on Wednes-
day 30th October, with Lord
Penney presiding. On the
day before, a plaque was
hurriedly put up outside the
entrance and a photo of the
late Sir Patrick Linstead
hung in the dining hall.
Guests of honour were
Lady Linstead and Lord
Murray, representing the
anonymous benefactor who
gave £295,000 to build the
Hall. Speakers were Lord
Sherfield, Chairman of the
Board of Governors, and the
Warden, Mr. P. Minton.
Mystery of the evening was
the menn written entirely
in French.
The 12 ft. long Linstead
Hall bar is due to be instal-
led in 3-4 weeks time in the
Lower Gallery. The hold-
up is caused by the custom-
made Southside-style shut-
ters. The cost, nearly £1,000,
will be paid for by a con-
sortium of brewers, one of
whom is Courage.
The bar will be run by a
residents rota of two stu-
dents per night under a com-
mittee of 10 headed by Spike
Bantin, who hopes the profit
will exceed the £200 per
year made by Weeks Hall
Bar. Opening hours will
be from 7.15 to 11.00 p.m.
The bar is intended for
residents and guests, but
other I.C. Students will be
allowed in.
In the last few days you should all have received a
letter about a life insurance scheme. Since everyone seems
to get insurance leaflets on an ever increasing rate, you may
wonder why the Union is taking a hand in sending out yet
another offer. The reason is that this is a block policy,
of the kind formed by many companies for their staff, and
hence is cheaper than an individual policy. The insurance
companies administration expenses are cut down by this
scheme, both because of its size and because we undertake
part of the work. The cost is about 60 per cent of a normal
policy.
It is intended for students with dependants, as it is
solely a life insurance scheme.
The constitutional reform committee has now started
to meet. In the last few years, there have been several
major and minor suggestions for changing the running of
the Union, some of which have been passed by Union
meetings. The idea of this committee is to save us from
changing things piecemeal, and to arrange for an informed
discussion of all the possibilities open to us. If anyone is
wondering what the issues are, I can cite examples; should
elections for certain posts be by the Union or Council,
should we have an Executive or Council, and if so, who
should be on them, should we have a sabbatical year for the
President, and what should our quorum be?
Ideas, please
The committee will be asking for ideas and views from
sections of the Union, such as the clubs committees and the
Constituent Unions, but it is also important to get the views
of as many individuals as possible. To get any constitutional
changes through two union meetings, with the necessary
two-thirds majority, is a difficult task. But this can be
made much easier if we can gauge the feelings of the
majority beforehand. So if you have any ideas about how the
Union could be run, or i f you just have an opinion about
some of the issues such as elections, can you please let us
know. You can write to the Constitutional Reform Com-
mittee, c/o the Union office, or tell any Floor Rep at a
Communicate Session; or just come into the Union Office.
Dear A u n t
Vera,
Carnival Queen
Theje is to be a Carnival
Queen contest this year.
The duties of this post are
not very arduous—very little
more than a "resident pretty
face." The first stage of the
contest will be run through
F E L I X . All the contestants
will appear in photographic
form in the next issue and
the whole college will have
the opportunity to vote to
choose the four top girls.
The final will be held at the
ICWA Valentine Party in
early February. All entrants
should sign a notice on the
ICWA notice board this
week, and contact John
Rogers in 435 Tizard for
photographs, as soon as pos-
sible.
Did you know there is a
Carnival Office in the base-
ment of 11 Princes Gdns. It
is open every lunchtime and
anyone with ideas about
stunts, collecting, events,
non-events, publicity, fetes
or anything to do with Car-
nival is welcome to come.
