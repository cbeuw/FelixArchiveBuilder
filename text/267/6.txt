best thing any Freshman can do with
Ms first grant cheque is take it into the
nearest branch of Westminster Bank and
openacurrent account.
For one thing, other people are going to want
to pay you money in the future. Most of them
will pay by cheque—and this will go on being an
embarrassment until the day when you finally
open an account.
Much more important, a cheque-book is still
the easiest way of paying out money. You no
longer have to carry a lot of loose cash in your
pocket which can get lost or squandered away
on trifles. Instead, your cash stays where it
belongs, safe in the Bank—and the cheque-book
in your pocket still lets you buy what you want,
you want. Afterwards your Bank state-
We'll help you
ment tells you where the money went; and this
too helps you to save.
It makes you feel taller
Later, your Westminster Manager will be able
to give you advice on how to make those savings
grow. He will become a trusted friend (this is not
flannel; he will) who can give you practical help
at the times when you need it most- during your
years at University, and throughout your life.
Besides these (and other) practical advantages
a Westminster cheque-book gives you some-
thing just as important: status. It proves that
you are an established adult in your own right.
This can be a very considerable asset.
Ifyou are interested, then we suggestyou call on
your nearest Westminster Manager—orfill in the
coupon on the right.
We'll help you... in all sorts ofways.
