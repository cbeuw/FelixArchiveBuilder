Our speaker at Monday's Wellsoc meeting v/as Mr. Gordon Rattray-
Taylor well known for his connections with the B.B.C. as well as for
his recent "
b
o
o
k "The Biological Time-Bomb", the title of which was
also the title of his lecture.
To an attentive audience of about 300, he gave a talk on
latest advances in biology and the social problems which they are
likely to cause in the future. She "Cloning" of human-beings, for
example, which would m
a
k
e sex unecessary, could clearly lead to
severe social problems, as could spare-part surgery, and the control
of the mind through drugs.
Mr. Rattray-Taylor concluded his talk with a pessimistic picture
of the year 2,000 w
h
e
n the population explosion will be already upon
us unless w
e do something soon.
Afterwards pur speaker answered questions from the audience and
the discussion was continued over coffee..
PRESS OFFICER FOR U

Yet again we've had another Press v» Union bust-up this term.
W
h
o can blame the papers for mis-reporting, when the only facts they
have to vrork on are dolgy? W
a
s the Evening New's report of Lilas'
effort for the 27th really that different from Felicity's? External
Affairs hopes to get over this hang-up. with the n
e
w post of Union
Press Officer, created for two-way liason.
If the Press ring up the Union for any information they should
n
o
w get a rapid reliable report. If I.C. has any newsworthy item
needing publicity, the Press Officer will try to sell the news.
PUBLICITY: IS VITAL. Any big organisation needs it. You will
help I.C. get the right kind by always referring gentlemen of the
Press straight to : Robin Dibblee, Linstead Hall. 589-5111 Ext.1168

A complaints book available at the cashier's desks in the Union

stressed that more notice will be taken of students complaints if
they complain at the time _nd not weeks later. There is also an
amnestry until December 1st for people w
h
o have stolen glasses to
return them to the bars. Action will be taken against anyone w

Council, as anti-left wing as ever, held their latest riproaring
session on Monday; giving our m
o
n
e
y away as casually 'and continiously
as they clicked their retractable ball-points, they also decided
for further contact with R.C.A. and against Union take-over of the
South-Side shop.
As far as (yawn) monetary matters are concerned w
e (thats all of
us in this Union, even Y
O
U
) are n

w prepared to pay up to £300 for a
college nursery (with a possible benefit to about a dosen people).
But w

according to Keith Guy, "reactionaries" and "bums". Similar words
could be U3ed to describe....
On a brighter note, one of the n
