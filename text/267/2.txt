2 FELIX 13 November 1968
BAXTER v.
BUCHANAN
On Thursday 31st October we saw the first really suc-
cessful debate at I.C. this year. To a packed concert hall
Raymond Baxter proposed the motion that "Motorists are
a Persecuted Class in Society."
At the start of his speech
Mr. Baxter stressed that he
was not, as stated in the
publicity, motoring corre-
spondent to the B.B.C., but
merely, " a poor bastard
who just happens to own a
motor car." Quoting many
statistics on motoring taxes,
he admitted they proved
very little but said that we
could not afford to spend a
lot of money on road im-
provements. He heavily
criticised two lane motor-
ways and ended with the
proposition that if everyone
ignored parking restrictions
the authorities would be
powerless.
Professor Buchanan, op-
posing the motion, after a
quick recommendation on a
teach-in on traffic problems,
went straight on to the fact
that the proposer had not
really spoken on the motion.
He had not, he said, proved
that motorists were persecu-
ted and was unlikely to do
so, persecution being too
strong a word. Describing
the country's traffic prob-
lems, he too wandered off
the subject but gave a good
description of possible solu-
tions to traffic congestion.
The two second speakers
kept more strictly to the
motion. Robin Dibblee,
for the motion, mentioned
high garage charges and
persecution of the motorist
by pedestrians. Mike New-
ton, opposing, said little
apart from motorists, drunk
with power, being useless
members of society.
Speeches from the floor
were generally notable only
in their lack of quality. One
can only hope that these will
improve as I.C. becomes
more debate-minded. A de-
bate is one of the few places
where one can legitimately
speak just to hear one's own
voice, a point proved admir-
ably by C. Parker with some
fine poetic banality.
After the summing up
speeches by Professor Bu-
chanan and Mr. Baxter,
who reiterated their earlier
speeches, the motion was
passed by 156 votes to 117.
U R N
G U Y
I.C. celebrated Mr. Fawke's (who?) nth anniversary
on November 4th this year. I am sure the original Guy
would have pressed on in the face of Rugby in Parliament
Square on the 6th. However the ground staff at Harling-
ton wanted two days to remove the aftermath of revelry.
About three hundred people were persuaded to go
down to Harlington (you know, our Sports Ground) by
coach. Despite the annual Ents committee rain dance to
prevent the burning of their chairman, fine weather pre-
vailed. A large fire topped by a suitable effigy (someone in
ICWA lost a pair of trousers!) started the frolic at 7.30, by
which time the participants were fortified against the chill.
Ents provided a £50 firework display which lasted for
half an hour and a £15 group which dragged on for two
and a half hours. A n on-the-spot observer remarked that a
firework display held at about 9 o'clock would have pro-
vided a welcome break from the heat of the fertility rite on
the dance floor.
SERJEANT MUSGRAVE S
DANCE
For their first production
of this session, the Dramatic
Society will give four per-
formances of " Serjeant
Musgrave's Dance," by
John Arden. The play, to
be performed in the first
week of December, is the
story of four soldiers who,
arriving in a snow-bound
colliery town under the guise
of recruiting, want to spread
their obsession with the fu-
tility and cruelty of war.
Although the play is set
in 1880 A D , it was written
in 1960 to express the au-
thor's opinions on this sub-
ject, which is very relevant
now in the light of develop-
ments in.S.E. Asia.
Details of the performan-
ces and advance bookings
will be published in the near
future, and enquiries can
be made to I.C.D.S. Busi-
ness Manager, c/o Union
rack.
TOUCHSTONE
'Student Revolts'
"A lot of silly people
paying 15s. to sit in a house
in a park and be told what to
think by an expert" — a
definition by a participator.
Dr. Little, the expert in
this case, described himself
as a " good New Statesman
liberal." A student at LSI7
from 1953-56 he had de-
monstrated against Sharpe-
ville and Hungary, but did
not sympathise with student
revolts directed against the
University itself. Student
demands for representation
on disciplinary committees
and a say in the content
of courses tended to make
his hackles rise, said Dr.
Little. Students were not,
according to him, full mem-
bers of the University, and
therefore could not be
equally represented with
staff. The University itself
should remain outside so-
ciety, preserving inviolate
its functions of teaching and
research. In this context he
condemned L S E students
for occupying the school.
Discussion groups agreed
that the student most likely
to demonstrate would be an
extrovert political scientist
with a left-wing back-
ground, like a socially in-
volved LSE student. In con-
trast the nearest the average
IC student gets to rebellion
is Morphy Day. What were
the reasons for student re-
volt ? Answers to this var-
ied from " capitalism "' and
" technical bureaucracy " to
" political naivete on the
part of students" depend-
ing on the political colour of
the discussion group. The
majority, however, assumed
the need for a society in
which the individual would
be more than a cog in a
bureaucratic machine. The
question was how to obtain
it,
A lyric interlude in Wind-
sor Great Park left radical
fervour unabated. The
formation of a new political
party which would lead the
masses to maximum partici-
pation was discussed. Two
Americans present said that
in the U.S.A. the time had
come .to " drop-out " and
live, Hippie fashion, on the
leavings of the intensely
materialistic American so-
ciety. Dr. Little suggested
that participation was not
compatible for a technically
advanced society. In an-
swer, some declared them-
selves willing to live on
bread and water (figurative-
ly) in order to achieve a
worthwhile society. At this
juncture, the discussion dis-
banded for tea.
THE DISEASE
THAT IS LIFE
Despite the counter attraction at Harlington, the
Wellsoc meeting on November 4th was greeted by a full
house of over 200 people.
The meeting took the form of a symposium, chaired
by Prof. A . J. Ayer, Wykeham Professor of Logic at
Oxford, who was ably supported by I.C.'s own Dr. Carlyle
from Biochemistry, and Dr. G . Spencer from a London
hospital.
Spores
Dr. Carlyle opened the
discussion and looked at the
problem of life from the
microbiological angle. With-
out attempting to define life,
except as " the sum total of
those activities that resist
death," he instead described
various orders of life-forms,
ranging from the viruses and
spores which seem to be a
transitional stage between
the animate and the inani-
mate, 'to the higher order
creatures possessing direc-
tedness, sensitivity and con-
sciousness.
Disease
The subject was then ta-
ken up by Dr. Spencer. In
a light hearted manner, he
looked at life from the medi-
cal point of view, with spe-
cial reference to the prob-
lems of transplantation and
prolonging life when it is
no more than prolonging
dying. Life he described as
a disease with a mortality
rate of 100 per cent, but his
views on death were more
serious, and he produced
figures showing the relative
times taken for the destruc-
tion of the brain, heart and
liver cells after deprivation
of oxygen commenced.
These showed that the heart
lived up to 10 mins. after
the brain was irrepairably
damaged, and " death " had
taken place.
Finally, Prof. Ayer took
his turn to say that life was
what you called it, and no
strict definition as yet exis-
ted. Only prejudice, he
said, prevented us from ac-
cepting the possibility of
consciousness in machines,
because we instinctively cor-
relate mental states with
certain physical states, with-
out having any fundamental
basis for doing so.
Immortality
Taking up Dr. Spencer's
aspect on the subject of life,
he looked ahead to the time
when brain transplantation
may be possible, and asked
what would happen to per-
sonal identity, and whether
immortality could be achie-
ved as a result.
During question time. Dr.
Spencer gave his views on
this, and said that once the
problem of non-regenera-
tivity of the central nervous
system had been overcome,
there was no reason why the
problem could not be solved
in the next 25 years.
Professor Ayer gave a
small sigh of relief at this
news, and remarked they
may be just in time for him
after all!
After vigorous question-
ing from speakers from the
floor, including one Adolf,
who proposed immortality
by regenerating a person
from implanting one of his
chromosomes in a fertilised
human ovum, the meeting
moved upstairs, where coffee
was available for the lucky
few.
Obituary
It is our sad but neces-
sary duty to report the tragic
death of our most revered
and longstanding columnist,
Colcutt. Last Saturday,
whilst trying to observe the
antics of certain council
members at the Lord
Mayor's Show, he fell to his
doom from the uppermost
point of his very own
Queen's Tower.
Mistaken for a bag of ce-
ment by an Irish labourer,
he was placed in a concrete
mixer and now forms part
of the uppermost window-
ledge in the new Science
Museum Library. His name
will always be remembered
for his idiotic, hard hitting,
destructive criticism
R.C.S.'s beloved mascot, Jezebel, takes Guilds' beloved
president, Dermott. and Guilds' beloved mascot. Spanner,
for a ride.
