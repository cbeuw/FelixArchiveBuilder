MORAL RE ARMAMENT
Three short years at Im-
perial College and then we
must choose a job and set
off into the outside world.
That is the programme for
most of us. But when one
looks at the world through
the newspapers or television
it does not look very invit-
ing. The world is in turmoil.
We, in Moral Re-
Armament, believe that if
you want to see the world
different the best place to
start is with yourself. Only
a reactionary wants to see
the world different without
being different himself. Can
Ave protest against corrupt
politicians if we cheat in
exams? Can we protest
against aggressive nations if
we are aggressive people? I
decided not; so I decided
to try to live my life on the
basis of absolute moral
standards: honesty, purity,
unselfishness and love. This
meant paying back money
and putting things right with
many people including my
parents.
Unless we can deal
radically and drastically
with human nature on a
world scale we will change
nothing. Rajmohan Gandhi,
grandson of Mahatma
Gandhi, put it this way:
"Could it be true that un-
less with God's help we war
with our natures, we are
destined to war with one
another".
I n A s s a m
Nothing makes me more
impatient than people who
air their fine theories with-
out any grounding in fact
and experience, so I hasten
to add that I had seen a
great deal of evidence of
the effectiveness of the
ideology of M.R.A. at work
in the world before I decided
to try it. In the past year
the most striking example, to
my mind, has been the re-
markable settlement brought
to Assam, the vulnerable
state of N.E. India. After
unrest lasting sixteen years
amongst the hill-people of
Assam, who wanted an
autonomous state, a political
solution has been found. The
newspapers were predicting
a second Vietnam situation,
but in 1968 the General
Secretary of the All-Party
Hill Leaders' Conference,
Stanley Nicholls-Roy visited
Panchgani, an M.R.A. centre
near Bombay, with a delega-
tion from the Assam Hills.
He said: "My visit to Panch-
gani convinced me that
M.R.A. is the ideology to
bring sanity and peace to
India's troubled- north-East
and to help it play its right-
ful part in Asia and the
world". In the next two
years Nicholls-Roy and
Assam Chief Minister
Chaliha invited two large
M.R.A. forces to Assam, in-
cluding "Anything to
Declare" a musical review
which started in Europe and
has toured Asia and

As a Patent Examiner you won't find a
row of peculiar people sitting outside
your office with their even more peculiar
inventions. Though you do get the 1
%
nut cases, the other 99% of claimants
are clever, well balanced —mostly they
are representatives of major companies
or their Patent Agents, making genuine
applications for a grant of a- patent on
all manner of systems and appliances.
It's a fascinating and, more often
than not, highly technical business. You
must study specifications and drawings,
and discuss them with the claimants or
their professional advisers. It's a job that
demands an incisive mind, quick to
perceive the basic originality of an idea.
Almost always it calls for some kind of
engineering or scientific knowledge.
That's why you should have, or expect to
obtain, a 1st or 2nd class honours degree
or an equivalent, such as Corporate
Membership of I.Mech.E. or I.E.E.
The salary scale for a Patent
Examiner is £1,287-£2,828 (you could
start above the minimum). After about
10 years, you should be promoted to
Senior Examiner, where your salary rises
to well over £4,000. You enjoy more than
4 weeks' holiday, and there's a generous
non-contributory pension,
If you are aged under 29 on
31st December 1971, write or telephone
for an application form and to arrange
to pay us a visit and see for yourself
what a Patent Examiner does.

1st March 1971.)

Australasia. Chaliha later
said: "M.R.A. has trans-
formed the climate of Assam.
That is a fact. I speak as an
administrator". The result of
this transformation was the
formation of a new autono-
mous state, Meghalaya,
which was inaugurated by
Prime Minister, Indira
Gandhi in April 1970. The
"Indian Express" wrote:
"The birth of Meghalaya
(Abode of the Clouds) seems
to have generated a climate
of good-will which few could
have believed possible even
a few months ago".
Effectiveness
To be an effective
ideological force requires
more than absolute standards
— it requires strategy. I
believe that the world is so
complex that only one force
is big enough and wise
enough to fully understand
it — God. The secret that
many have forgotten is that
God can speak to us.
Definite, accurate, adequate
information can come from
the mind of God to the mind
of man. To me it was a
thrilling idea that God has a
plan for each person, each
country and the world. Many
people do not believe in God
but that does not prevent
them from taking a simple
decision to listen and to
obey. If nothing comes they
have lost nothing. If God
puts a thought into their
minds they are launched.on
an effective and revolution-
ary road which can drastjc-
ally affect the course of his-
tory. Whatever I do when I
leave Imperial I want it to
be relevant to the needs of
society.

In the aftermath of the
Carnival Walk some £60 has
still to be paid in. The fol-
lowing people owe money:
— I. Bennett, I. Carr, P.
Clarke, A. Gerrard, I. Harris,
M. Hollings, P. Lonnen, R.
Phillips, M . Whitman, and
C. Williams, with sums rang-
ing from 2/2 to £15/9/10.
Please pay your money in
immediately in the form of
a cheque made payable to
"Imperial College Carnival
Account" and hand in to the
Union Office or to the Lin-
stead Hall porter. Please pay
in the full amount — if you
have difficulty collecting the
money then come and see
me with your walk form and
if we can't collect the money
for you we will refund the
difference.
WHY HAVE EXAMS?
I n t r o d u c t i o n
Exams act as straightjackets on our education, like best
eggs we are selected and graded. Exams should not be ends
in themselves, but a means of measuring certain previously
agreed factors/teaching/learning aids. The aims of a course
need to be defined before its success can be ascertained.
A i m s o f a course
Very few Departments state, or perhaps have even thought
of the philosophy behind their courses. When they were
asked to discuss with freshers the ideas and philosophy of
the courses few did so, hence another group of students have
embarked on a degree with little guidance or understanding.
Although aims necessarily vary from department to depart-
ment, it would seem reasonable that they should be to
develop:
1 The student's interest.
2 An understanding of the subject and a theoretical basis
so new problems can be thought through (critical
awareness).
3 A critical approach to 'conventional' wisdom.
4 The relationship between a subject and related fields
and society.
Most of course, achieve just the opposite! Students are fed
on facts and expected to regurgitate them in three hours,
once a year, yet today facts are often soon outdated.
T h e present e x a m s y s t e m
Most defenders of the present standard examination would
define their aims as testing achievement, providing a basis
for future selection, consolidating learning, providing feed-
back, testing ability to stand up to stress.
If you look at these criteria few stand up to investiga-
tion. Traditional exams have proved to be unreliable •
—
different marks; the same examiner giving slightly different
marks to the same script at different times. Again we must
ask what this type of assessment is supposed to test, apart
from memory and endurance — hardly understanding, rather
conformity to a taught course perspective. What feedback
is there when students never see their assessed papers?
Wastage (i.e. the guy who dropped out last year) is usually
a result of examination failure — is it really a learning
failure? — why not a staff or institution failure in the
teaching, or in the course — why are all the flaws in the
student, instead of the system. It has been shown that there is
little relationship between performance now (i.e. the grade,
or even possession of your degree) and performance in
later life. Many employers ask only that you graduate. A
'good' degree implies little except that you can stand a
lot of strain and produce programmed information in the
required order slightly better than your colleagues. It is
likely that exams cannot and do not test the qualities, either
employers or research institutes seek.
A i m s o f assessment
Although it is the traditional exam which is mainly
attacked above — there are many other forms of assessment
— objective (!) tests, open book, oral, delayed time test,
continuous assessment, dissertation — all with advantages
and disadvantages. The prime consideration should be to
find the most appropriate assessment methods for particular
stated aims — and this is for both staff and students to
establish. An important reason for retaining exams, from
the University point of view, is their function as a means
of controlling students — exams are a constant threat over-
shadowing education.
P o s s i b l e r e f o r m s
Ta
Mclooge
there should be automatic re-sits
each student should be assessed by several examiners
(including external markers) to maximise accuracy
and impartiality.
The marking criteria should be publicised and (so
students know just what the situation is — no mysteries
and open to consideration by the students. Staff and
Students together should formulate the assessment
system.
Better timing of exams.
All types of assessment should be investigated and
used.
Better explanation of the existing appeal procedure,
student is involved in a course in order to develop
and express his understanding and assessment of himself
and of his course. Just as staff and students should decide
the content of courses, so they should define the principles
of their assessment.
As long as the examination system retains its strangle-
hold, education will be a secondary consideration.
