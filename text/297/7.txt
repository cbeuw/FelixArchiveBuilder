SPORTS FELIX
Scoring Spree for
I St )CV
In the 2 games played so
far this term, the 1st X V
have scored 57 points with
3 against, the scores being
registered against City Uni-
versity (16-3) and South
Bank Polytechnic (41-nil).
In the former game rather
an unfortunate incident oc-
curred when one of the I.C.
back row was sent off the
field by the referee (who
happened to be a lecturer at
City University) for allegedly
punching the opposing cap-
tain. Interviewing the of-
fender afterwards revealed
that the facts were incor-
rect — the punch having
missed! City provided rea-
sonable opposition to a
slightly unfit I.C. team re-
turning after a festive
Christmas vac. — several of
the team 'flaking' rather
noticeably towards the end
of the game, (especially
those in positions of auth-
ority?). The points were
scored from tries by Adams
and Harrison (via the post),
one of which was converted
by full back Pudney. He
also kicked a penalty after
Alan James had dropped a
fine goal.
With the recent crisis in
the club over a change in
captaincy a few changes
were made for the game
against South Bank Poly-
technic. Unfortunately, the
opposition were too weak to
enable effective study of
certain players except per-
haps a too familiar figure
in the S.B. front row! The
scorers are too numerous to
mention individually but
even both props trundled
over from some of James'
'fair-like' breaks! An in-
jury to No. 8 Icely may keep
him out of the next cup
game to be played against
Royal Free Hospital on
Wed. 27 January.
At this stage of the sea-
son the record against col-
lege sides is quite imposing
— only one out of 11 games
being lost, 284 pts scored for
the club and 37 pts against.
A pity the Saturday record
against club sides is not so
impressive.

IC 1st X I
I.C. got off to a good
start, scoring two goals in
five minutes. After this they
never looked like conceding
a goal, but scored at regular
intervals. The standard of
play was fairly high and
I.C. looked strong on all
parts of the field, especially
on the wings. As for the de-
fence, I.C. have only con-
ceded 4 goals against Col-
leges this season which
speaks for itself.
I C 6, U C 0
In the first game of the
term, an unfit I.C. team
managed to pulverise U.C.
I.C. were far superior in all
parts of the game and a
mention must be given to
Ron Palmer and Mark
Tatchell, who played ex-
tremely well.
IC 1, Burnt A s h 1
This game again proved
that club sides are a great
deal stronger than college
opposition, but I.C. stuck
to their job well, and al-
though conceding a goal
ten minutes from time, man-
aged to equalise through
right-half Alistair Forbes.
Dinghy EDITORIAL
on Ice
Ask any layman and he
would undoubtedly be of
the opinion that the dinghy
sailor was a hibernating ani-
mal who ventured out onto
the water in late spring but
spent the winter in the boat-
house with a lot of wet var-
nish. Not so the Imperial
College breed. It'll take
more than a touch of frost
to stop him and the possi-
bility of a swim in the icy
waters merely 'adds to the
fun' and definitely sharpens
up the concentration. Of
course, the occasional pas-
sing iceberg provides an ex-
cellent means of stopping
the opposition and nobody
would argue that you can't
tell where the wind's com-
ing from in a raging bliz-
zard! You may think that
there are less energetic ways
of getting a cold shower but
hanging over the side of one
of these hairy dinghy mach-
ines is certainly tops for ex-
citement.
As in past years, the stan-
dard of performance among
l.C. helms is extremely high
and with five out of six in
the U.L. 1st team regularly
coming from their ranks,
this is no idle boast. I.C.
sailors recently figured well
in the first round of the Bri-
tish Universities Trials for
a team to tour the States in
the summer and three out
of the ten qualifiers viz
Nick Martin, Pete Claydon
and Alan Curran were from
the home club. There's no
doubt that reservoir sailing,
even in a place like NEAS-
DEN in the middle of win-
The first few weeks back at I.C. have been hard and
torturous ones for the sports people. The mental and physi-
cal (more visual!) effects of the festive Christmas vac. had
to be eliminated by the old traditional methods involving
much sweat and tears before the advent of the impending
cup games for many clubs. This of course is not true for
those who enjoyed the benefits of a winter skiing holiday
— as many I.C. sports people seem to have done.
One section of the sporting community were certainly
not idle over the vac. This was the girls who represented
the U.L. womens hockey side who played in a very high
standard 5-day tournament at Eastbourne, U.L. being the
only non-county side participating. These sporting festivals
might be rather good ideas for many clubs who find they
haven't enough money to stage an extensive tour this year
— certainly playing and social standards prove very de-
manding!
Looking ahead somewhat, we turn to what may become
a very controversial subject — I.C. Sports Day. This is held
at Motspur Park when the 3 colleges compete against each
other for the President's Cup. Over the years one has noticed
the decline in popularity of this important event in the sport-
ing calendar of the college. Last year's seems to have been
rather poorly organised and some people are asking for a
change of venue to Harlington and a change of day to
Wednesday. Various problems arise here since the standard
of the athletics will obviously suffer on a non-cinder track
and also that Motspur would be unavailable on a Wednes-
day. Let us hope that A.C.C. will be able to settle the prob-
lem satisfactorily.
As various club captains try to whip up enthusiasm
for their forthcoming cup games, a recent event must be
mentioned which caused enormous concern in one particu-
larly vociferous section of I.C. It finally culminated in over
50 people hiring a coach for a weekend to Cardiff — the
official reason being given as the annual Wales v England
game in the Home Counties rugby union championship.
Needless to add Wales won yet again but even the English
members of the party weren't grumbling by 10 o'clock on
Saturday night! What this has to do with I.C. sport is not
immediately clear but when one looks at the lack of articles
on Sports Page this week the glimmerings of an answer
appear.
ter, attracts a good deal of
top class competition.
With the possibility of
warmer weather just around
the corner, one begins to
think of offshore cruising
and what better way of get-
ting away from work and
the polluted London atmos-
phere than to take a trip on
board the college cruiser.
You'll find a weekend pul-
ling on ropes and breathing
salty Solent air will make
a pint of beer taste pretty
cood.
Clean Sweep for
Soccer Club
l.C. entertained Kent
University on Wed. 20 Jan-
uary, in a block fixture for
the first four teams. The
games were delayed till 4.0
p.m. due to Kent's late ar-
rival.
The 1st XI played some
very good football. They
were obviously a much sup-
erior side to the Kent lst
XI. I.C went ahead in the
first half through Darley
who scored a very neat goal
from fullback Paul Worth-
ington's corner. In the 2nd
half I.C. let midfield slip
and were put under pres-
sure, Kent's equalising goal
however came from a mis-
take by goalkeeper Bake-
well, he stubbed his toe and
presented the Kent centre-
forward with an easy goal.
The 2nd team had no
trouble, they trounced their
Kent counterparts 7-0, with
Tony Richards playing a
dominant part in the goal
scoring. The 2nds defence
looked very much in com-
mand with old timers Wid-
elski and Mcardle proving
too experienced for the
Kent forwards.
The 3rds had a more
strenuous game, only just
winning by 2-1.
The 4ths also won by the
convincing score of 7-3, the
Kent goals only came after
I.C. were reduced to 9 men,
M. Hannan was booted on
the nose and had to leave
the field and Kevin Eustace
very sportingly left the field
before the end in order to
catch the first coach.
