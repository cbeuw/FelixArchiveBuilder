Trying to beat those pesky h
Philippa Skett is relatively sure that this is probably impossible, but w
s you are reading this
article, I can guess you
are either rallying your-
self up to go and awk-
wardly introduce your-
self to your hall mates, or are slumped
in a mid-morning hangover that just
won’t budge. As young adults faced
with the trials and tribulations of
small talk throughout Freshers’ Week,
alcohol seems the closest friend you
may make all week. So spend some
time here acquainting yourself with
the science side to drinking, along-
side what to expect the morning after.
It might even provide you with some
welcome ice breakers for he Mingle,
instead of asking for the umpteenth
time what A-levels your new com-
panion did.
It is actually one of science’s lit-
tle secrets that we are still unsure as
to what a hangover actually is. No
one doubts a hangover is real; it is
extremely diﬃcult to deﬁne it as a
myth when you are hugging the toi-
let, begging for a quick death to save
you from the never ending pain. It has
been classiﬁed as the bunch of symp-
toms following moderate alcohol con-
sumption; headaches, nausea, fatigue,
anorexia, depression and, although
not really physical, a sense of shame
and self-hate (depending on how long
you let yourself stay in Metric). How-
ever, what causes these? And, more
importantly, can they be reversed, or
avoided altogether?
he hangover is a complex mani-
festation that is not entirely dose
dependent; it can be altered by food
consumption, physical exertion dur-
ing intoxication, sleep quantity and
quality, or even gender and age. Stud-
ies present a plethora of data con-
cerning hangover severity parallel to
certain “cures” administered prior,
during, or after drinking, but these
seem inconclusive.
So what contributes to the morn-
ing pain? he hangover is the direct
eﬀect of alcohol on the body, and the
eﬀect of the compounds produced
once it is metabolised. It directly irri-
tates the gastronomical tract, leading
to vomiting, and it also stimulates a
higher rate of production of intestinal
and pancreatic secretions, leading to
stomach pain and nausea.
Alcohol is also a diuretic, meaning
it naturally increases urinary output
(leading to the infamous landmark of
a night out, the Breaking of the Seal),
which results in dehydration. his in
turn causes the common thirst, dry
mouth, and dizziness felt the morn-
ing after, which is not helped by an
increase in sweating and vomiting
during elevated inebriation. Drink-
ing a lot of water alongside alcohol
can remedy this to some extent, but
it may not stay down if the stomach
is particularly sensitive after alcohol
exposure.
he hangover headache, a trade-
mark of a night out, is caused by vaso-
dilation in the brain during drink-
ing, to the point where the brain has
swelled slightly and is pressing against
the skull. his can be prevented some-
what by taking that aspirin before you
go to bed and before the headache
kicks in, to slow down inﬂammation.
Paracetamol is really a no-no: it is me-
tabolised by the liver, which is already
under a lot of pressure. Sometimes,
it may be better just to wait it out –
no pain no gain, right? he ultimate
hangover cure is time – just snuggle
down, sit tight, and wait for the storm
to pass.
he hangover can also be skewered
by the presence of other biologi-
cally active compounds in the drink
besides alcohol, called congeners,
which worsen a hangover further. he
darker the drink, the more congeners
present, and the more you might re-
gret it in the morning. Avoid whiskey,
red wine and brandy, and stick to the
colourless stuﬀ. Still feeling rough?
Eat foods that are high in fructose
and complex carbohydrates to reverse
low blood sugar levels caused by the
metabolic response of the liver to al-
cohol. A build-up of lactic acid, a side
eﬀect of alcohol metabolism, can in-
hibit glucose production and lead to
more headaches and fatigue, as the
brain can only run on glucose. Eating
some toast or fruit can help shake oﬀ
that hangover – if you can stomach it.
Drinking therefore sets oﬀ a chain
reaction of disruptions throughout
the body, that come together to con-
tribute to the pain of the morning af-
ter. But it doesn’t end here, as there
is still a lot left to discover in terms
of hangovers and possible cure. So,
as you are also about to embark upon
the path to educational nirvana, you
should consider researching the ul-
timate hangover cure along the way.
You have a good three to four years to
perfect it, and it makes a great excuse
for trying those paint stripper-based
drinks at Cheapskates on a Wednes-
day. And you never know, you might
even have fun along the way.
A
he active component of alcoholic
drinks, as any Imperial student worth
their salt could tell you, is ethanol, a
2-carbon alcohol. he eﬀects of etha-
nol, intoxication, i.e. being drunk,
including euphoria, reduced social
inhibition, loss of coordination, word
slurring, and drunk texting your old
ex – should be familiar to anyone
who’s touched the demon drink. How,
though, does ethanol exert its eﬀect
on the human body?
Ethanol is water soluble, and is ab-
sorbed into the bloodstream through
the stomach and the small intestines
before proceeding to the liver, where-
upon it is metabolised in a two-step
process. Ethanol is ﬁrst converted into
acetaldehyde via the enzyme alcohol
dehydrogenase, and then into
acetate through the action of al-
dehyde dehydrogenase. Acetate
can then feed into biochemical
pathways beneﬁcial to the human
body.
For those curious, the ‘Asian
ﬂush’ reaction, a genetic
trait common in those of
Asian descent, is caused by
an imbalance of the afore-
mentioned two enzymes:
more eﬃcient alcohol dehy-
drogenase and less eﬃcient
aldehyde dehydrognase, re-
sulting in a rapid build-up of
acetaldehyde upon alcohol
consumption. Acetaldehyde
is highly reactive and toxic at
high concentrations, causing
further vomiting, sweating,
an increased pulse, and,
most evidently, skin ﬂushing.
Unfortunately the liver is very
much limited in its capacity to
convert ethanol into acetate. he
rate at which ethanol is metabolised
is set – very approximately one reg-
ular drink (one glass of wine, one
beer, one snakebite etc.) every
ninety minutes. Such values
will ﬂuctuate from individual
to individual depending on
gender, but ultimately the liver
will only be able to take on so
much work. Drink more than
the liver can excrete and one’s
blood alcohol level will inevi-
tably start to rise.
Whilst the liver tackles what
it can the brain eventually
feels the impact. For the non-
neuroscientist: the brain is
composed of billions of neu-
rons, which communicate with
one another through the release
of chemicals known as neuro-
transmitters. Some of these
pathways are excita-
tory, others inhibi-
tory. Ethanol
acts upon a
number of
t h e s e
n e u -
ro-
trans-
m i t t e r
systems ,
and it is
through these
interactions that
ethanol functions
as a drug.
he targets of etha-
nol within the brain are numerous,
enough to warrant dedicated neuro-
science research. In essence, ethanol
is a depressant, enhancing the eﬀect of
inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as
GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid for
fellow biochemists), whilst simultane-
ously weakening the eﬀects of excita-
tory ones, such as glutamine. Other
pathways, including ones associated
with behavioural responses and high-
er thought, are also impacted, with
higher-order areas of the brain, i.e. the
cerebral cortex, aﬀected before lower-
order ones, i.e. the cerebellum.
My advice? Take it slow when drink-
ing and give your liver time to do its
biochemical business. And, after
you’ve completely ignored that sage
tip during Freshers’ Week, at least
drink some water before passing
out. Your brain will thank me later.
Milk and Tequilla is apparently
a nice cocktail. Who knew. Note:
don’t try that at home
