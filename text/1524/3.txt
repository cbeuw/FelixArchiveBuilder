Hi, my name is .......... ....................... and I’m studying
...................
At A Level, the grades I obtained were (delete as appro-
priate) A*A*A*/A*A*A/AAA/UUU – I’m here from UCL
I’m looking for (delete as (in)appropriate – success rate
not 100%) friendship/the bar/a picture of you naked, can you
pass one to me ASAP?/someone to hold at night/fun, maybe
more ;)/the toilets – they’re hard to find.
I swear on my life that I haven’t Facebook stalked you... that
much. No, really, I honestly haven’t. I accidentally clicked on
your profile once, and then, just by accident, flicked through
all of your photos. Let’s change topic, please.
My enthusiasm for science (delete truthfully) is very high/
is lowering by the second as I see all the maths involved/is...
fuck, I’m doing science? How did that happen/is solely down
to Brian Cox/I’m an engineer/medic you arsehole
I’m now going to (delete, without lying) constantly stare
through your window in halls/never talk to you after this
week/awkwardly nod at you when I see you in halls
Scared to talk to people? Well don’t worry about it at all. Freshers’ Week can be in-
timidating. It’s fine. Just cut this out and iron it onto your t-shirt.*
*If you actually try to iron this on your t-shirt then why are you allowed out of the house?
