What’s on in London?
Eva Rosenthal guides you round the culture of the Big Smoke
hat’s on in Lon-
don? Everything
is what’s on in
London! Of
course, the truth
is you’ll get caught up in Freshers’
Week stuﬀ and (whether you believe
it or not) the famous Imperial work-
load that you’ve probably heard about.
But you’re in London; this is one of
the greatest cultural cities in the world
and aﬀords many, many opportunities
for labouring on your artsy creden-
tials. Below I give just a few recom-
mendations so that the busy Impe-
rial student doesn’t leave London after
ﬁrst year only being able to talk of the
wonders of student priced drinks at
the Union.
1. The Donmar Warehouse
his playhouse is world-renowned
for having produced absolute gems
of theatre. It holds only 250 seats and
due to its miniature size, one always
feels as though one were involved in
the action. One of the great advan-
tages here are the prices, with tickets
starting at £10.
2. The Royal Opera House
For less than the price of a large bot-
tle of vodka at Essentials, you can ﬁnd
yourself attending the opera at Cov-
ent Garden. I would say that this is
a pretty good excuse to ignore those
calling you a snob and try the pleas-
ures of an evening of opera. here is
one small hitch: you will probably
not have booked in advance, and will
therefore need to get up at around 6
in the morning in order to queue until
10am for one of these cheap seats. I
still say it is entirely worth it.
3.LeonardodaVinci:Anatomist
If you were in London last year, per-
haps you remember the hype created
by the Leonardo da Vinci show, which
was on at the National Gallery. Tickets
were prized possessions, to be shown
oﬀ by their owners as if they also
gained one entry to the 100m Olympic
ﬁnal. Not so for this da Vinci exhibi-
tion, in which his exquisite anatomi-
cal drawings, of interest due to their
scientiﬁc accuracy and artistry alike,
are displayed. Taking place at the
Queen’s Galleries, it also gives you a
chance to escape watching the dread-
ed changing of the guard should you
ﬁnd yourself near Buckingham Palace
at around 11am.
4. Second Hand Books
Just oﬀ the Charing Cross Road, near
Trafalgar Square, is the Dickensian
alleyway Cecil Court, where you can
ﬁnd an astonishing number of second
hand and rare bookshops. If nothing
could make you happier than ﬁnding
a ﬁrst edition of an obscure Nabok-
ov novel for 15 quid, then this is the
street for you.
For more on books: head on over to
the Books section, where you’ll ﬁnd a
guide to the best book stores in Lon-
don.
5. BFI Southbank
Classics, foreign ﬁlms, and festival
winners are on show at the British
Film Institute’s headquarters at the
Southbank. Until mid October, their
Alfred Hitchcock retrospective dis-
plays the classiest of nail biting ﬁlms.
6. Galleries in Bond Street
Imperial students have occasionally
developed the inability to make it to
East London, where, for the time be-
ing, most of the contemporary art
scene is to be found. his is somewhat
understandable. East London is a 25
minute tube ride away from polished
South Ken. So, for those of you lazy
bums who can’t make it, there is al-
ways Piccadilly and the surrounding
area. White Cube, Gagosian, Hauser
& Wirth, Hannah Barry: the possibil-
ity to see some of the most important
contemporary artists is very close by
and completely free.
7. The Serpentine
You have absolutely no excuse not to
go to the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde
Park. At most, it is a ten minute walk
away from the South Kensington cam-
pus and almost always has something
worth seeing. Until the 14th of Octo-
ber, you could take a lunch break away
from the eyesores that are some of
those 60s buildings to visit the sum-
mer pavilion designed by controver-
sial Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.
8. Soho Theatre
A lovely and relatively new theatre in
the heart of Soho, putting on modern
and alternative theatre. he prices are
again very student friendly. One of my
favourite things about it, apart from
the quality of the shows of course, is
the bar, where you can go for a quick
post-show pint or cocktail (I can’t help
but recommend the Soho Speakeasy
here) and perhaps meet some of the
very ‘un-Imperial’ people who are
having a drink.
W
It’s not your fault. You always liked
science. You read “New Scientist” and
watched Horizon as a kid and some-
how the path to Imperial seemed so
clear. Now you realise there is a prob-
lem. Maybe you mentioned the sol-
dering iron in your bedroom to that
pretty girl at the bar and died a little
inside as her eyes glazed over. Maybe
the cute boy next door stopped talk-
ing to you because you did not under-
stand the David Lynch ﬁlm he showed
you. It’s time for action. We all know
you will never be truly arty, so it is
time to fake it.
We’ll start with the most important
point, dressing right. In no particu-
lar order, you will need: skinny jeans,
large earrings, scarlet lipstick, ironic
leopard print, a novelty pendant that
looks like a robot, a Christmas jumper,
and obviously some oversized glasses.
If you think some of that is not appro-
priate for your gender, you are wrong,
wear it anyway. Oh, and dye your hair
a stupid colour or grow a moustache.
Next you need to act right. Try to
get invited to private viewings but on
no account look at the art: that will
immediately mark you out as a fraud.
Instead, take full advantage of the free
beer and talk about how messed up
your life is. Buy a Mole-
skine notebook and
whip it out to do a quick
sketch at inappropriate
moments. If you have
an iPad, use that in-
stead. If anyone asks, say
that Hockney did it ﬁrst.
Don’t worry if you don’t
know who that is, Wikipedia
can be your friend.
Finally you will need to
talk right. his is the hard
one. You should give the
impression that you
have a vague notion
of art history. his is
not as hard as it sounds
because enthusiasm is frowned upon
in the art world. If anyone engages you
in conversation you can act bored and
change the subject. It is actually fairly
simple. Impressionism is kind
of blur- ry and
fauvism
is even
w o r s e .
Dadaism is
the random
shit and sur-
realism is the
trippy shit. Pop
Art is cans of soup
and conceptual
art is largely un-
m a d e
beds and piles of elephant dung.
Learn the names of three obscure
artists that no-one has ever heard of
and look shocked when people pro-
claim ignorance. I would recommend
looking through the Saatchi gallery
catalogue and picking two at random.
Get the third from a tumblr.
If you get all this right you will be a
more irritating and morally repugnant
person, but with any luck you will
at least get a buzz from the unjusti-
ﬁed sense of superiority. Maybe, just
maybe, the gorgeous, kooky kids from
Goldsmiths will let you join in their
cocaine fuelled sex parties that you as-
sume they are having 24-7, but prob-
ably not.
When I drew a dick over a friend’s
book in school I got told off, but
when old Leo scrawls out a wang
it’s “art”. Whatever.
