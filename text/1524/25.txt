ondon is a huge city, with
something for everyone;
for bibliophiles like my-
self one of its main attrac-
tions is the huge number
of bookstores that make it the envy of
every other city in the world. I present
here a short list of just a few of the best
places in central London where you
can satisfy your literary cravings.

A guide to London’s best bookstores

L
Waterstones Piccadilly
203-206 Piccadilly, W1J 9HD
waterstones.com
Occupying the building that once
housed the famed Simpson’s depart-
ment store this is now the largest
bookstore in Europe. It has a great
general selection, particularly of ﬁc-
tion, and has a special Russian lan-
guage section with some 5,000 titles in
stock. The academic literature section,
however, is somewhat weak.
Waterstones Gower Street
82 Gower Street, WC1E 6EQ
waterstones.com
Housed in a Grade I listed building,
this branch of Waterstones manages
to maintain a unique character that
makes browsing a pleasure. Formerly
the ﬂagship store of the Dillon’s book
chain this is one of the best academ-
ic bookstores in London. Whatever
you’re studying, this shop is likely to
have the textbooks you need.
Daunt Books
83 Marylebone High Street, W1U
4QW (Flagship store)
158-164 Fulham Road, SW10 9PR
(Chelsea store)
dauntbooks.co.uk
Daunt Books’ unique feature is that
it arranges most of its stock by geo-
graphical region – be prepared to see
guidebooks to a country sitting on the
shelf next to novels by that country’s
most renowned authors. This is a great
system for ﬁnding fantastic books that
you might have previously never con-
sidered buying. Of particular note, as
might be expected, is the chain’s com-
prehensive choice of books by foreign
authors. Daunt’s largest store can be
found in Marylebone, but its Chelsea
branch has comparable stock and is
much closer to College.
Hatchards
187 Piccadilly, W1J 9LE
hatchards.co.uk
Founded in 1797, this is the oldest
bookstore in the country that is still
trading. It has a very reasonable range
of books in store and holds regular
signings. This should be a stop on eve-
ry bibliophile’s tour of London, if only
for its atmosphere and historic feel.
Forbidden Planet
179 Shaftesbury Avenue, WC2H 8JR
(Flagship store)
forbiddenplanet.com
Well known for selling cult memo-
rabilia, comic books, and graphic
novels, Forbidden Planet also has
London’s largest selection of science
ﬁction and fantasy novels: the perfect
store for any SF geek.
CecilCourtSmallIndependents
Cecil Court, WC2N
cecilcourt.co.uk
Cecil Court has been a great centre for
specialist bookstores for over a centu-
ry. With nearly a dozen bookstores, as
well as antique shops and places sell-
ing art, this is a perfect place to ﬁnd
something unusual. Of special interest
are Goldsbro Books, specialising in
signed ﬁrst editions and the historic
esoteric bookstore Watkins.
Charing Cross Road Small
Independents
Charing Cross Road, WC2H
The quintessential small independ-
ent bookshops, most of these stores
have a more general and wider se-
lection than those on nearby Cecil
Court. The place for you, whether
you’re looking for a rare out of print
tome or some cheap second hand
paperbacks.
Foyles
113-119 Charing Cross Road, WC2H
0EB (Flagship store)
foyles.co.uk
London’s best known independent; it
was once infamous for its byzantine
organization and selling practices,
but it has now become a thoroughly
modern bookstore chain. It stocks a
wide range of titles and is particularly
impressive when it comes to academic
textbooks. The ﬂagship store also fea-
tures jazz & classical music, and for-
eign ﬁlm departments.
Waterloo Bridge Book Market
Under Waterloo Bridge, Southbank
A fascinating and vibrant collection of
stalls selling all manner of books, as
well as historical map prints.
Persephone Books
59 Lamb’s Conduit Street, WC1N
3NB
persephonebooks.co.uk

companyrepublishingworksbyforgot-
ten twentieth century authors, mainly

their books, as well as a small number
of related works from other publishers,
in the small store adjacent to their of-
ﬁces. The staﬀ are friendly and knowl-
edgeable – always willing to help ﬁnd
the right book for you.
