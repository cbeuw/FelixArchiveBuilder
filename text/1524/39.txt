Day 3 of the ICURFC Summer USA
2012 tour saw us face our ﬁrst oppo-
nents, MIT, in a closely fought ﬁxture
played at Briggs Field on the MIT
campus. Despite some hangovers and
the rock hard surface, the team ar-
rived at the facilities (read portaloo)
in high spirits an hour before the 1pm
KO and just as the sun was getting to
full strength.
Hertog set the tone for a scrappy
ﬁrst 25 minutes with a scuﬀed kick
oﬀ that barely made the ten. Fielded
by MIT, the home side pushed for-
ward and camped in the IC half for
the ﬁrst ten minutes. Overcoming this
initial shock, Imperial started play-
ing, and the remainder of the ﬁrst half
was spent in the MIT half. Approach-
ing the 20 minute mark, Imperial ﬁ-
nally converted their pressure and got
over with a series of trademark roll-
ing mauls from a lineout; L’Bour the
scorer, 5-0 Imperial.
Scrappiness coupled with “tour
ﬂair” led to several missed chances
from the touring side. However, with
Hardisty and L’Bour clearly beneﬁting
from the summers conditioning pro-
gram with some strong carries and
with Fraser directing things from 9,
things were certainly improving. Her-
tog hacked on an IC clearance kick
before gathering and scoring under
the post.
MIT’s ﬁst points of the game came
from clean quick ball oﬀ the top of the
lineout and lead by their Irish at im-
port at 10, led to MIT’s ﬁrst points of
the game.
IC set piece was solid throughout
the game a particular highlight be-
ing captain Jackson, whose perfor-
mance was admirable throughout. A
hard line run by Hertog oﬀ a DSP and
a good support line run by the fresh
Cox lead to Imperial’s third try. Veter-
an IC hooker Coutts earned TotM for
repeatedly referring to the IC defen-
sive lineout by its regular name “Twin
Towers” instead of the tour commit-
tee approved “Jack and Jill”. MIT’s
strong running continued and al-
though plagued with handling errors
the home side strung together several
quick mauls and scored through their
prop from short range making it 19-
12 to IC.
Although dehydration set in due to
the scorching heat, a diminished wa-
ter supply and last nights festivities,
Imperial College were now into their
stride. Training pitch rugby from a
lineout in sent Hansen crashing over
from close range to make it 24-12.
The MIT counter, with some tired
defensive work, lead to another score
and pushed the home side to within
touching distance of winning.
IC weathered another hard attack
and countered, the last points com-
ing from a penalty try from Hertog.
Caught hard on his way down the in-
cident certainly didn’t mar what was
an excellent blow out for both teams
and a great way to start the tour with
a 31-19 victory.
Without changing facilities, blue
tour blazers were donned without
showers and the squad made their
way to a BBQ hosted by the gracious
MIT team. We then progressed to an
Irish themed bar were songs and sto-
ries were exchanged untill late. Par-
ticular highlights were Griﬃths bring-
ing home the boat race in spectacular
fashion and the incredibly talented
freshers choir. A thoroughly enjoy-
able day, IC look forward to welcome
the MIT team to London in Spring
2013 where they can only hope to
match the level of hospitality shown
to them in Boston.
The Tour Continues.
