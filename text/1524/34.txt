Letters to the Editor
Dear Tom,
It’s one minute past the deadline
you set me and I still haven’t
written anything. I prom-
ised you that I would give
the Hangman section
the reboot it so des-
perately needed, and
I failed you. I’m sorry
Tom, I have brought
dishonour to you and
your family. I will do
the right thing and kill
myself.
Yours,
Hangman
Dear Tom,
Morrisons had run out of paraceta-
mol and ibuprofen, so I’ve bought
ten boxes of Lemsip. I’m working my
way through them. I’m doing this for
you Tom! I’m so sorry for the shame
I’ve brought to you and your fam-
ily and your ﬁrst issue of Felix. You
promised so much and you’re going
to give so little and it’s all my fault.
I hope one day you’ll ﬁnd it in your
heart to forgive me, Tom.
Yours,
Hangman
Dear Tom,
I just had eighteen cups of lemsip. I
now hate lemons. I don’t ever want
to see a lemon again.
Yours,
Hangman
I just saw a lemon. I
punched it in the face
and murdered its
family. here is
lemon juice every-
where and I’ve run
out of kitchen roll.
What do I do?
It’s OK. I’ve sorted
it out. Lemon drizzle
cake. Do you want some
lemon drizzle cake? I
m a d e some lemon drizzle cake.
Shit there’s someone knocking at my
door. Brb
Fuck, it’s the police.
hey must know! hey
know I’m a cold heart-
ed lemon killer. I put
two baby lemons in a
blender and forced its
parents to watch. I’m a
monster, Tom. I’m a mon-
ster! I’ve got to eat the lemon
drizzle cake and hide the evidence.
Phew. It’s OK. hey weren’t here
about the lemons, they were here
about the Lemsip. Someone from
Morrisons tipped them oﬀ. I’ve told
them that it’s ok and that I’m doing
this for you. You told me to drink the
Lemsips because you’re Felix Editor
and you know best.
he police want to know your ad-
dress and phone number. I think
they want to congratulate you on the
whole Lemsip thing. I can’t feel my
internal organs any more lol. Do you
know what I’ve always wanted to be?
A dancer, Tom. A dancer. Tap dance
or modern jazz. I think they’d be my
forte.
I told the police I want to be a danc-
er, but they don’t care, Tom! hey
don’t care and they’re making me
cry. hey’ve dashed all my hopes and
dreams. I just wanted to dance, Tom.
hey are taking me to hospi-
tal. Why can’t they take
me to the stage? he
dance stage! hat’s
where I belong.
hey’re send-
ing some people
over to your place
:). I hope they give
you a medal because
you’re a good person,
Tom. I’m sorry for ruining
your ﬁrst issue :D. I mean D:
I’m having my stomach pumped and
thinking of you.
he doctor said I’ll never dance
again! Tell me this is not true, Tom!
Tell me this is not true!
Behind the scenes of Hangman
You meet her ﬁrst day in halls and she
seems nice. You probably speak to her
for no more than 4 minutes, but she’s
exceptionally keen to make friends
with you, and seems very agreeable.
Months later you’ll come to realise you
can’t remember a single fact about her.
Her Facebook proﬁle pictures are al-
ways group shots, and her poses are all
so identical you almost wonder if she’s
held a protractor up against the mirror
in her bedroom alone to get the perfect
38 degree head tilt and hand on hip
pose. Statuses include “picadilly insti-
tute with the gurliiess xx” (sic.) and “al-
People you'll meet at Imperial
who you probably shouldn't
be friends with
1. Insecure Facebook girl
ready got so many great new friends
at Imperial! Love you all xxox” –
posted within the ﬁrst 3 days.
January arrives, and you realise you
haven’t seen her since you don’t know
when, not that you really care. It turns
out she left Imperial in mid-Novem-
ber and now studies Clinical Psychol-
ogy at Hull. She’s also unfriended
everyone at Imperial, and when you
speak to her “gurliiess” – who strug-
gle to recall her until you reference
her overwhelming blandness – they
all make that “oh, her” face, and you
realise she was an IFG all along.
Think you’re
funny? Punk
Well, you very well may
be, and you’ve come to the
right place. We always want
contributions and new ad-
ditions to the little humour
team over here. How, you
scream at the page? Stop
shouting at paper, you look
weird. Not sure if we want
to talk to you anymore, but,
fine.
Email: felix@imperial.ac.uk
saying you’re interested and
we’ll be in touch.
