This week you’re in FRESH-
ERS’ WEEK. WOOOOO!
YOU’RE ABOUT TO GO
WILD, LIKE BEAR GRYLLS
OR SOMETHING. Oh, wait,
you have a maths test, and
another one, and a lab re-
port. You check Facebook
and see your friend from
UCL posting about the orgy
he just attended.
This week, the freak next to
you is frantically checking a
dictionary (where the fuck
did he get that from any-
way?) to see if something is a
word. You think of saying hi to
them, I mean, you are stuck
next to them for an entire
hour during the lecture. He
lectures you on commas, you
never speak again.
This week, you’re really ex-
cited for Fresher’s Week. No,
wait, it’s Freshers’ Week isn’t
it? Right? Oh, what? It’s actu-
ally freshers’ Week or Fresh-
ers’ week. You’ll fit in very
well here with that level of
pedanticism, don’t you worry
about it at all. You feverishly
check to see if pendaticism
is a word.
You approach a girl/guy/ge-
latinous blob of your dreams.
Brains and beauty, how can
they have it all? You ask them,
in what you think is a charm-
ing gesture. In your haste it
came out as “SEX?”. They
turn away, and start looking
up words in a dictionary. May-
be you dodged a bullet there.
You get hit by a bullet.
A girl runs up to you and
shouts IT’S FRIDAY, GOTTA
GET DOWN ON FRIDAY.
Grumpily, you look at them
in contempt and discuss.
“Fuck you, that’s an old, no-
longer topical reference.”
She doesn’t look impressed.
Turns out she was just trying
to remind you of your lecture.
You cry yourself to sleep.
So there you are right, just
being all friendly yeah, all
you wanted to do was be
friendly and offer casual sex
on a semi-regular basis. Oh
well, his loss. You decide
to cut your losses and go
to bed early with a copy of
50 Shades of Grey. You cry
yourself to sleep: the writing
in that book is really that bad.
This week, you’re walking
down the road, minding your
own business, when BAM
Jimmy Carr runs up to you. He
tries to convince you to invest
in his scheme. He tells you it’s
top secret and you shouldn’t
tell anybody. 100 phone calls
later and you think you may
have betrayed his trust. You
cry yourself to sleep.
It’s a good year it seems
Scorpio. You decide to take
early action in your attempt
to get top notch grades. You
seduce a lecturer and fulfil all
of his fantasies. It’s messed
up. Seriously messed up, not
the way your wardrobe looks
messed up. You still get a 2:2
after all that. At least Imperial
is stringent with grades???
Oh Libra. It’s difficult being
the one that has to break this
news. You’re going to have to
partake in social interaction.
You start crying into your
laptop as you finally shut the
World of Warcraft forum that
was open. Could be worse,
you could be using The Stu-
dent Room to ask (primarily
horny men) for help.
You’re running down the road.
Wait, is that Usain Bolt and
the Swedish Handball team
attempting to keep up with
you? He can’t catch you.
You’re euphoric. Seb Coe
calls you to say you’re amaz-
ing. The Spice Girls re-unite
(again) in your honour. You
wake up. You were dreaming,
and you still suck at running.
This week you will magically
transform into Seb Coe. You
walk around, desperately try-
ing to find times to inappro-
priately make long and bor-
ing speeches. There aren’t
any. You take the nuclear
route and just start announc-
ing how the trains are inspir-
ing a generation of people to
get public transportation.
This week you get lost at
Freshers’ Fair. To be fair, it’s
easily done. You sign up at a
stall for a conceptually inter-
esting society, which prom-
ises discounted helicop-
ter rides. Turns out you’ve
walked to Sandhurst and
have just signed up for the
armed forces. Good luck in
Afghanistan, my friend.
H TO THE IZZO... IT’S THE HOROSCOPES
THE NEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS
NEW SILICON GUN
MAKES BREAST
SURGERY A THING OF
THE PAST
DRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK
Got a picture of your mate being a waste of oxygen? Send it in to felix@imperial.ac.uk
This gentleman is obviously sick of Freshers’ Week already
