h freshers. Hello there.
We here in the Com-
ment section like noth-
ing more than a good
rant (more on that lat-
er). Having just started your journey
through Imperial you may not feel the
need to rant quite yet. You will un-
doubtedly be excited for your new life
in London; meeting new people, living
away from home, (the quim,) and so
on. I’m sure for a few weeks, maybe
even months you’ll enjoy the easy life
that is being a fresher; turning up to
lectures drunk (or not bothering at all
– the easier, more digniﬁed option),
not having deadlines, having a social
life, you get the picture.
Before I paint a picture that has you
queuing like lemmings to jump oﬀ the
Queen’s Tower I should reassure you
that it isn’t all doom and gloom. (As a
brief side note; if you do plan on tak-
ing the plunge may I urge you to jump
away from the lawn - we’d rather keep
it available for use during the few days
of the year a marquee isn’t pitched on
it.) You’ll probably ﬁnd that the work-
load will steadily grow and as it grows
you’ll need to balance that work with
play to keep yourself sane (and alive.)
Without trying to sound too much
like an advert, might I suggest writ-
ing for Felix? It’s fun, weirdly relaxing
and surprisingly rewarding. I certainly
ﬁnd it strangely satisfying when I see
someone reading one my comments
or articles. It provides a somewhat
warming feeling to know that out of
how-ever-many-thousands of cop-
ies that are circulated each week at
least a few handfuls of students will
read and appreciate your work. You
may even inspire them to write some-
thing in return. You don’t even have
to be any good at writing (you might
have already picked up on that one),
although a vague grasp of the English
language is considered convenient.
So, you’ve decided you want to give
it a go. Good decision – well done.
You’re now faced with that oh-so-
irritating problem; “what shall I write
about?” Well that is entirely up to you.
Take a ﬂick through this ﬁne publi-
cation and see if anything causes a
creative stir in the depths of your right
brain.
You could review your favourite TV
show, ﬁlm, restaurant or book. Write
about fashion or news or some crazy
science that none of us know about. Or
you can get personal; write your views
on something that you feel strongly
about. Let the world (well, just Im-
perial really) know your thoughts on
something that’s important to you.
I’ll admit some bias here – I much
prefer the latter. You’d be surprised
how hard it is to review a TV show
or an album without sounding like a
complete tool (I’ve tried). So write a
comment piece for us, I urge you. It’s
easier than you think; you don’t have
to come to a conclusion, you can just
toss ideas and thoughts around the
page until you end up with something
that vaguely resembles a piece of in-
teresting writing. One of the best as-
pects of writing comments is you’re
free to write whatever you want – it’s
your own opinion so feel free to be as
outlandish or as reserved as you wish.
he more astute of you should
have noticed that I haven’t yet spo-
ken about ranting. Well the time has
come. What I like to think of as a more

join the
Felix fam-
ily and give
writing a go
ham-ﬁsted approach to writing com-
ments is actually my favourite. You
see, so many things irritate me on a
daily basis, from the people busking
in the subway between college and
South Kensington tube station (seri-
ously, if you’re not good enough to be
in a band and can’t aﬀord music les-
sons then get the hint), people walking
too slowly, the price of razor blades,
the fact I still haven’t won the lottery
(one day, one day...). he list goes on
but the message is clear – there are
plenty of things to write about. So go
on then, take the plunge (into the Felix
Oﬃce this time) – join the Felix family
and give writing a go.
Bringing you a blast
from the past
George Barnett
t being Freshers’ Week, you’ll
no doubt be busy settling into
your new surroundings: a new
home, a new university and
above all a whole load of new
faces. Among these new faces, you
may ﬁnd some who are a tad dissatis-
ﬁed with the student life at Imperial.
From them, you’ll learn all about how
“lame” and “dead” the campus life is
here; how much more fun people are
having over at UCL and LSE; and how
the gender ratio (one topic of discus-
sion which never seems out of vogue)
really sucks.
Imperial’s reputation precedes itself:
we are known, above all, for being a
boring university. You’ve never heard
of someone being drawn to Imperial
by its edgy club scene.
his stereotype has a few main caus-
es. First and foremost, the predomi-
nance of science subjects leads people
to assume that the students here are
interested in equations, lab work and
not much else. Couple this with the
Herculean workload expected of us,
and it’s not hard to see where the vi-
sion of Imperial, as a place where you
shut yourself oﬀ from society and
work yourself to the bone for three to
four years has its roots.
But beneath this popping-pro-plus-
in-the-library surface, there’s a vibrant
student life waiting to be found: you
just have to look for it. hough there
are people here who don’t care much
for the world outside the lecture thea-
tre, there are hundreds – nay, thou-
sands – of students having a great
time outside their courses.
Take Felix. his paper goes to print
every week and relies on the contribu-
tions of literally hundreds of student
volunteers, working together to pro-
duce something absolutely great (for
more on the virtues of joining the Fe-
lix team, see George’s article above). If
newspapers aren’t your thing, not to
worry: how about a dance society, or
one geared around ﬁne art? You could
try your hand at juggling, or give de-
bating a go. hat’s not even to mention
the myriad sports clubs that compete
every Wednesday, before descending
on the Union for some post-match
revelry.
Here’s something that might come
as a surprise to you: Imperial has over
300 oﬃcial Clubs and Societies, one
of the highest ﬁgures in the country.
hese are all real and active contribu-
tors to university life. At them you’ll
meet tons of interesting people, deter-
mined to make the most of their time
at Imperial.
So how much fun is Imperial? hat’s
entirely up to you. If you sincerely
want to spend day and night with your
head buried in a textbook, then more
power to you. But for everyone else,
know that that isn’t the only way. You
can be as involved with or as detached
from the student life as you want to be.
