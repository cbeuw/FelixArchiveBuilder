II hope you’re already planning on coming to Freshers’ Fair but if
you’re unsure, hopefully a glance at this guide can persuade you
to come along! Freshers’ Fair is where all the Clubs, Societies
& Projects at Imperial are given a stall to promote their group’s
activities and persuade you to get involved.
On the day the atmosphere is fantastic as thousands of students
ﬂood campus looking for a group where they can practice their
hobbies. Stalls are arranged by type so if you’re a fan of the
outdoors or a keen musician you should be able to ﬁnd the groups
associated with those pursuits all in one area. However, I would
strongly advise you to make an effort to visit each area even if you
doubt you’ll ﬁnd anything interesting there; coming to university
is one of the best times to branch out, and even if you don’t see
anything of interest at least you’ll pick up a few more freebies!
We’re incredibly proud of the diversity and dedication of our
groups, allowing students to pursue almost any interest they can
imagine, so make sure you take full advantage of the breadth of
activities we offer during your time here.
At Freshers’ Fair we operate a strict no trading policy, so you
needn’t worry about having to part with any money on the day.
Instead the clubs will encourage you to sign up to their mailing
lists so that you can be kept informed of when they are meeting
and what they’re up to. Don’t worry about signing up to too many
as it’s easy to unsubscribe once you’ve decided which groups
you’d like to remain involved with – initially the best idea is to keep
your options open.
Once you’ve decided which Clubs, Societies or Projects you want
to join, most require you to pay a membership fee to join. Joining
them is easy. Just go to our website; imperialcollegeunion.org.
Many run free taster sessions to demonstrate their activities. They
might seem daunting, but many similarly daring people will be in
the same boat and the groups will be familiar with and more than
willing to help out newcomers.
If you do miss any early gatherings of groups you are interested
in, don’t worry as you can join a group at any time of the year.
Likewise, you can sign up to any group’s mailing list whenever you
like. Just get in touch via the contact details on
imperialcollegeunion.org
Enjoy the Fair and I look forward to meeting many of you on the
day!
