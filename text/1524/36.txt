And watch out for the FUCWIT (Felix University/College Wide Invitational Tournament), which launches next week. his is both a group tournament (where you get into teams) and an individual competi-
tion. here are prizes at the end of the year for the winners. his isn’t a fucking school speech day, there won’t be any of that “£5 Amazon book token” crap as a “prize”. Seriously though, how is a book token
a good prize. It’s like money (a bit of paper you exchange for things) but is much more restrictive. Anyway, get yourself ready to enter it.
