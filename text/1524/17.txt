A – Accessories
It’s a well known fact that accesso-
ries can make or break an outﬁt so
thank heavens for being in London!
From charity shops to market stalls,
high street sales to Bond Street gold,
whether it’s dainty handmade items
or bold statement pieces that you’re
looking for, it’s sure to be lying around
somewhere in London just waiting to
be found.
B – Beauty
For essentials Boots and Superdrug
are plentiful in the city. For make-up
brands most department stores have
large make-up sections with a good
range of products such as Clinique,
Bobbi Brown and Laura Mercier. A
special mention goes to Mac with
stores across the city, this brand has
an extensive range and is great value
for money.
C – Charity shops
A great way to update your wardrobe
and donate to a charity without mak-
ing a massive dent in your student
loan. Be sure to check out Oxfam in
Dalston Junction for vintage clothes,
British Red Cross in Chelsea for de-
signer pieces on the cheap, and Salva-
tion Army just oﬀ Oxford Street for
high street seconds.
D – Department Stores
Harrods, Selfridges, Liberty, and Har-
vey Nichols are just some of the great
department stores London has to of-
fer. They stock a wide range of cloth-
ing in various price ranges from high
street to luxury brands. Particular
highlights include the Harrods Ice
Cream Parlour and Liberty’s station-
ery department.
E – Ebay
Eﬀectively the world’s largest car boot
sale: if you’re looking for something
quirky or sold out you will most likely
ﬁnd it on ebay. In need of a wardrobe
clear out? Ebay is a great way to make
some cash to top up your student loan
F – Fresher events
Most of our favourite high street stores
will be holding speciﬁc student shop-
ping nights this October where you
can team cocktails and DJs with spe-
cial oﬀers and extra discounts, perfect
for updating your new student-sized
wardrobe. Topshop, River Island, and
Urban Outﬁtters sit somewhere at the
top of the list, but keep your eyes and
ears open for more.
G – Gymwear
Ethos, the Imperial gym and swim-
ming pool are free for all students,
with that in mind you’d be mad not
to take advantage. For the boys JD,
JJB Sports and Sportsdirect are good
for cheap gym wear, while for the girls
try Gap Body and Sweaty Betty. Nike
Town at Oxford Circus is great for
sports shoes and clothes for all.
H – Hair
Nothing beats a good haircut. Toni
and Guy, Headmasters, and Rush all
have branches across the city and oﬀer
student discounts. Rush even give you
50% oﬀ your ﬁrst visit to them. For a
good barber, head to central london
where you’ll ﬁnd many, try Murdock
or Joe and Co for a great cut with min-
imal fuss. In desperate need of a cut
but seriously low on funds? Hairdress-
ing training academies are great for a
very cheap cut: Aveda, Vidal Sassoon,
and Toni and Guy all have academies
in central london.
I – Inspiration
With the internet at our ﬁngertips
littered with blogs and online maga-
zines, there’s hardly a drought for in-
spiration. Yet sometimes, we just pre-
fer to sit and watch the ideas walk by.
Some of the best style spotting loca-
tions include Somerset House (around
Fashion Week), Oxford Circus (i.e.
Topshop’s gang of walking advertise-
ments), Soho, Shoreditch, Brick Lane
and of course around South Kensing-
ton itself (try heading towards Har-
rods from College).
J – Jeans
If jeans are a key item in your ward-
robe it is worth investing in a good
quality pair. An ill-ﬁtting pair will
make you feel uncomfortable and look
bad. It can be hard ﬁnding a pair that
ﬁts you well, but it’s worth persever-
ing as the results will be well worth it.
Levi’s, Lee, 7 for all mankind, and Gap
all have a wide range of cuts, washes
and prices and are good places to start
your search.
K – Knitwear
The new ‘IT’ item, knitwear has been
gradually making its way out of the
back of the wardrobe, and this year
it’s bigger than ever. Whether you like
patterned granny knits, casual slouchy
numbers or big ﬂuﬀy jumpers covered
in mohair and rabbit fur, you’re sure
to ﬁnd it here. Investing in a couple
of one-oﬀ pieces can be daunting,
but watch this space for our Autumn/
Winter updates to help you keep on
top of this season’s latest trends.
L – Lingerie (girls)
La Senza, Ann Summers and the
newly opened Victoria Secret Angels
– London has it all. But perhaps a
bit oﬀ the beaten track there’s always
vintage slip dresses and boutique de-
signers especially if you’re keen on the
‘underwear as outerwear’ trend.
M - Magazines
Vogue (UK/Italia/French/US), Elle,
GQ, i-D, and Dazed & Confused are
the obvious choices here for good rea-
son. For something a bit less readily
available, yet full of inspiration and
new ideas, try Rankin’s new bi-annual
Hunger, or Vice if you’re feeling par-
ticularly alternative.
N - Night out
A bit of advice, London is NOT Es-
sex, Newcastle or Liverpool so please
don’t look to trashy reality TV shows
when dressing for a night out. Instead,
do a little research and dress appro-
priately. A few ground rules: Guys,
generally avoid jeans and trainers and
also stay away from overly shiny suits
– they’re anything but classy. Girls,
wear heels you can walk in, and most
importantly dance and stumble home
in, but keep to boots if you’re hitting
up Ministry of Sound or Fabric etc.
For the standard student night out a
nice top and shorts/skirt will do nice-
ly, but stick to smart cocktail dresses
for anywhere in South Kensington
or Mayfair, after all that is where the
Royals party.
O - Outerwear
If your wallet can take it, Burberry is
the place to go for well tailored outer-
wear, but if not may we suggest Bar-
bour, Zara or Topshop. Vintage stores
however are always a more reasonably
priced option for that new statement
coat.
P - Portobello
The famous Portobello Market opens
every Saturday and is nicely signpost-
ed from Notting Hill Gate tube allow-
ing for maximum eﬃciency in ﬁnding
those vintage jewels we all crave so
much. Should you happen to venture
towards Portobello during the week,
make sure you check out the chain of
Retro Clothing stores for a cheeky bit
of vintage Dior or YSL.
Q - UniQlo
Better quality than H&M and cheaper
than American Apparel, Uniqlo is the
place to go for your wardrobe basics
in a wide range of colours. Their men’s
merino wool and cashmere jumpers
are great staples and their Heattech
clothing is a great alternative to ther-
mals in the winter.
R – Revisionwear
Whereas the answer to this may have
been ‘Primark’ in the days of GC-
SEs, it should now most deﬁnitely be
anything but. For reasonably priced,
comfortable yet chic lounge-around-
clothing try Vero Moda on Oxford
Street, and of course the obvious op-
tion of H&M.
S – Socks
Dearest male readers, socks can be
your best friend and worst enemy all
at once. By this, we are referring to
patterned socks (friend), socks with
holes (gross!) and white socks paired
with anything other than white trou-
sers (foe). So if you happen to ﬁnd
yourself reaching into an all-white
sock drawer without the white Elvis
ﬂares to accompany them, it’s time
you took some light retail therapy*.
Instead, every man should have a cou-
ple of pairs of black/grey/navy socks
for smart occasions with fun colour-
fully-patterned pairs making up the
rest. A cheap but eﬀective revamp,
this is something better done sooner
rather than later.
* If you also have white Elvis ﬂares
please refer to intense treatment and
make your way to the Felix oﬃce im-
mediately.
T - Topshop
We’ve already mentioned it a hun-
dred times and there’s no denying that
Topshop/Topman is a comforting sta-
ple for guys and girls alike. And be-
ing in London we couldn’t go without
mentioning Topshop’s ﬂagship store
in Oxford Circus. At 5 ﬂoors, this ha-
ven oﬀers everything you could possi-
bly need - hair and nail salons, beauty
counters,w an entire ﬂoor of accesso-
ries, a dazzling array of shoes, oh and
did we mention clothes?
U - Underwear (guys)
Two words: Calvin Klein. And per-
haps by now you’ve noticed the lack
of male contribution to this section.
So please, do get in touch if you’d like
to get involved and contribute to the
men’s side of fashion.
V - Vintage
If you’re a fan of vintage shopping
you’re in the right city for it. Most
shops have a good selection but can
sometimes be overpriced. Check out
The East End Thrift Store, Beyond
Retro and Retro Man for the best bar-
gains. Fancy designer vintage? Mint,
Lucy in Disguise, and Absolute Vin-
tage all have excellent selections.
W - Window shopping
For when your student loan is looking
thin, window shopping is perhaps the
best form of retail therapy. Best seen
during the Christmas season, the best
window displays include Harrods,
Liberty, Selfridges and Harvey Nich-
ols - it’s well styled, on trend and, most
importantly, free.
X - XS/XL
Shopping can be a nightmare if you
are really tall/small or have really
small/large feet. For the tiny and tall
girls a lot of the high street shops
have petite and tall ranges, which, al-
though smaller, are generally on a par
with the other collections. For shoes
most shops stock a range of sizes from
3-8, although Oﬃce and ASOS of-
ten stocks sizes 2.5 and 9. Menswear
is slightly trickier. On the high street
Burton and Next have ranges for the
taller and broader man, and for shoes
High and Mighty has a wide range up
to a size 17. If you are a smaller man
carefully selected womenswear can
be your friend, however you may face
criticism if you get said look wrong*.
*We refer delicately here to over-exag-
gerated bulges.
Y - Why?
Why dress well? For a more in-depth
point of view look out for Saskia Ver-
hagen’s piece in comment in the ﬁrst
campus edition of Felix (5th October).
Z - Zara
Thank God for Zara, truly a saviour
store for every possible occasion. It’s
chic, cheap(ish) and always on trend.
Good quality basics make it perfect
for solving wardrobe crises, and its
range of well ﬁtted shirts and jackets
makes mastering the dreaded ‘smart
casual’ easy for both sexes.
