Loved every minute of it
Welcome to Imperial freshers!
Over the next few weeks you will
have lots of societies throw-
ing oﬀers at you to sign up,
and you will probably be sift-
ing through all those dates
and ﬂiers wondering which
clubs are for you and which
events you should go to.
I’m here to make that deci-
sion all the more simpler and
tell you about the experience I
had this summer in Kenya as part
of Imperial KOP Summer Team
2012!
iKOP (as we are more aﬀection-
ately known) has been a society at
Imperial since 2010. Our Summer
Team has grown since then from sev-
en members in our ﬁrst year to eleven
last summer, and this year there were
ﬁfteen students travelling to Kenya
from Imperial alone!
Since we began we have raised over
£30,000 to help fund projects, which
provide healthcare, a regular source of
food, and schooling for orphans and
vulnerable children in Kisumu, Kenya.
Although each summer a group of
students travel for two weeks to vol-
unteer with our projects, throughout
the year there are various socials and
fundraising activities that everyone
can get involved in!
We’ve spent the past year getting
up to all kinds of mischief: Disney
themed bucket collects around South
Kensington, dressing up as cupids and
delivering roses in lecture theatres
on Valentine’s day, singing Christmas
carols to the public and selling Krispy
Kremes and other treats at shows held
by ICSM Drama and IC Gospel choir.
One collect saw me walking out of
SAF in a rabbit onesie to the amuse-
ment of my friends.
I had always taken an active part in
KOP activities, helping out since ﬁrst
year, but this year was my chance to
join the team and experience ﬁrst-
hand the developments our fundrais-
ing eﬀorts had helped to create!
Arriving into busy Jomo Kenyatta
Airport in Nairobi after an eight hour
ﬂight, we faced a long bumpy coach
ride to our home for the next two
weeks, he Duke Of Breeze Hotel in
Kisumu.
On our ﬁrst day in Kisumu we were
given our Kenyan names. I became
‘Denise Achieng’ and every time we
used our new names we were greeted
with kind laughter. here were several
more introductions to come as we vis-
ited the oﬃces of all the local project
partners
and by the end of
the greetings we felt very wel-
come in Kenya indeed.
Our ﬁrst project, Kochogo Feeding
Centre, was built and funded solely
by KOP students! he centre provides
lunch and dinner for 180 boys and
girls every day! hey have a policy of
never turning anyone away, so as well
as the local school kids they also pro-
vided food for some of the elders in
the community. With only 3 cooks at
the centre, there was plenty to help
out with in the cooking, farming, and
shelling peas department. And once
the children had arrived from the local
schools and were fed, we could start
playing games!
hey loved sweets, being lifted up,
playing drip drip drop (a take on duck
duck goose but with water instead),
blowing bubbles, hiding under the
multi-coloured parachute, and danc-
ing to the music blaring out of our ma-
tatu truck.
Murals painted by past KOP stu-
dents decorated every wall of the feed-
ing centre. hey served to educate the
children as they ate, on the names of
the continents, animals and the im-
portance of hand washing amongst
other things. We later added to these
our own murals: parts of a ﬂower and
planets of the solar system (typical Im-
perial students), what can I say we love
science!
One afternoon, we visited a local
school and gave lessons about HIV/
AIDS to students from as young as 9
and right up to 18 years. hey were
very intelligent and already knew a
lot about the disease, but one of the
things that was most satisfying was
getting the chance to address some of
the misplaced stigma surrounding its
transmission.
After spending one week
there, it was time for us to leave
(but only for a short while) and
change over to our second
project at Pal Omega.
A community of women
widowed by AIDS had
come together to create
the school and a support
group for local families
aﬀected by the disease.
As soon as we entered
the classroom, the chil-
dren greeted us with
beaming faces and a
shrill sing song of all
the nursery rhymes they knew.
hey sang for us at the start of every
day, and it was lovely to hear them
add to their song list the new nursery
rhymes that we had taught
them, so
that by the
end of our
stay, the
daily re-
cital had
g r o w n
i n t o
a full
perfor-
mance
o f
K e n -
y a n /
Western tunes.
I found my time at Pal Omega
inspiring, the dedication expressed
by the group for each other and their
cause was apparent and I was grate-
ful to be able to sit in on one of their
meetings and hear their personal ac-
counts of life with HIV/AIDS and to
visit the homes of their members,
some of whom were the mothers of
children we had met earlier in the day
at the school.
Our last day of projects saw us re-
turn to Kochogo for a big party with
all the kids and project partners. It was
a time for dancing and celebration! A
chance for us all to say our ﬁnal good-
byes to all the children.
All in all, we were able to visit 4 of
the projects supported by KOP: Ko-
chogo Feeding Centre, Pal Omega
Primary School, St Anne’s Nursery
School, and HOVIC (Hope for Victo-
ria’s Children).
Our trip also provided us with ample
opportunity to explore the beautiful
scenery and culture that Kenya is well
known for. We drank the local beer
(Tusker), listened to the local music
(Reggae??), went to the local clubs,
and ate staple meals prepared by the
locals (Ugali and chapatti’s= mmm de-
licious).
We took boat rides onto Lake Victo-
ria to see the hippos pop their heads
from out of the water and stood ashore
to watch the last rays of sun before
sunset.
Several trips to the local Masaai
market left us laden with goodies, feel-
ing smug that we had at least tried to
bargain for our trinkets, expecting full
well to pay higher than normal price,
but knowing it was going to beneﬁt the
local community nonetheless.
And although our trip to the equa-
tor line was overshadowed by rain
and umbrellas, our trek up the rocks
of Kit Mikayi onto the summit made
up for it. he view was
spectacular and
we had another
chance to watch
the sun come
down on Kisumu.
I really miss my
time in Kenya;
both the people I
had the opportunity
to share that expe-
rience with and the
local Kenyans that I
got to meet but most
of all I will miss the
children and the fun
t i m e s that were had driving
the roads of Kenya with reggae music
pounding from our matatus!
