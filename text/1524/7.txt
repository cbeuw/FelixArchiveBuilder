Credit rating
In a similar fashion to the UK’s A
Level system, an entity’s credit rat-
ings deﬁnes its future prospects in
the market. Ranging from AAA (top
notch, Imperial standard – of course)
all the way down to ‘junk’ (basically
anything below BBB and you may as
well GTFO) agencies such as Moody’s,
Standard & Poor (read AQA, OCR
etc.), assess the credit worthiness of
companies and even countries, deter-
mining how easily these will be able to
access funding.
Quantitative easing
That’s when they bump everyone’s
grades up after a tough exam... right…
no? Not quite. When things go to shit,
central banks like to use QE as a tool
to revive the economy by ‘printing’
more money or buying government
bonds in the hope of boosting lending
and spending.
Nationalisation
As the name suggests, it is the process
of bringing a company and its assets
under state control. Possibly one of
the worst things that can happen to
a ﬁrm, ending up with a reputation in
tatters and having to face the taxpay-
er’s perpetual fury.
Security
Aside from the wonderful men and
women who will pin you down, strap
you to a chair, ﬂash a light in your
eyes, and interrogate you if you have
the audacity to step over a chair in
Metric (note: the previous sentence
may contain exaggeration), a Security
can be anything from a share in a com-
pany, a bond or mortgage debt.
Bond
Don’t get excited Chemists! Bonds are
essentially the IOUs of ﬁnance. Who-
ever issues the bond has to pay it back
to the holder at a ﬁxed date with a set
interest rate.
Administration
Essentially when a company has had
too much vodka at a party and it’s par-
ents need to come pick it up because it
threw up all over the nice carpet. This
rescue mechanism allows UK compa-
nies to continue trading and attempt
to get itself out of trouble under strict
supervision.
LIBOR
Fully known as the London Inter Bank
Oﬀered Rate, and is the rate at which
banks lend to each other, set daily by
the British Banker’s Association ex-
cept when naughty folks interfere with
it. Tut tut.
Naked shorting
Not as exciting as it sounds, it simply
means the illegal practice of selling as-
sets without establishing whether the
trader can borrow them in the ﬁrst
place.
