THE NEW UNIFORM
You’ll be able to spot this over-eager
little munchkin in every department.
They’re really, really, really happy to be
here. And they want the whole world
to know about it. I like to imagine
that they might have lost
all their clothes on the
way over and purchased
a wardrobe’s worth of IC
regalia at the Union Shop,
not realising that High
Street Kensington is around
the corner. Observe them in
their droves – with Imperi- al
College London-branded everything –
strutting the streets of South Kensington,
recognisable by their nauseating levels of
hope and pride and ICU iPad case.
THE ELLE WOODS
She arrives at halls in a shiny new
MiniCooper,wearingatightsweat-
er and Vuitton Neverfull, followed
by four burly movers in a truck
that you could fit your entire
house into. Lectures become an
exercise in wondering whether
she can possibly have yet an-
other over-thought outfit and
ostentatiously monogrammed
handbag to wear. Which, invari-
ably, she does. You’ll also find her
at nights out, trying to hold in an
eviscerating scream when some
drunken lout spills beer on her vel-
vet Manolos. She might seem unap-
proachable, but really she needs a
friend to help her understand how it
feels to be poor for a little while.
SCIENCE JOKE T-SHIRT
Yes, I know this is a university of science,
technology and medicine. But I really
don’t need to see an unintelligible equa-
tion or something about Schrödinger’s
cat impaled across your chest. And I most
certainly don’t need to read
any obnoxious science
puns, outside those
I’m forced to read
in Felix. Do us of the
small female popula-
tion of Imperial Col-
lege a favour: ditch the
lame shirt. Those of you who were
a five at school could be an eight
at Imperial! So drop your stand-
ards and pick up something chic
to blow up your chances at a whole new
bite at the apple.
THE LEAVERS HOODIE
High School Class of 2012! Rub it in
why don’t you. This one holds a spe-
cial place in my heart as I projec-
tile vomit a deluge of cynicism
all over their rabid optimism
and taut skin. Identity is such
a fluid concept when you
start university. It’s time to
shed your schooldays and ex-
periment with a new personality.
Why not try out one of the popu-
lar ones? You’ve got your Varsity
Jocks, Asian Nerds, Cool Asians,
Unfriendly Black Hotties, Desperate
Wannabes, Burnouts, sexually active
band geeks, and the greatest people
you will ever meet (the Felix Edito-
rial Team).
