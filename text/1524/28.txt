How to be a film buff
John Park tells you how to blag your way to expert knowledge
a-dee-da, la-dee-da… oh,
you talkin’ to us?
Hello and welcome, Im-
perial College Freshers of
2012, to the ﬁlm section
of Felix.
Congratulations for making it here:
you’re oﬃcially clever, but snap out
of it. You’ve still got a long way to go
until you graduate, including getting
through the ﬁrst week of Uni.
During Freshers’ Week you will
meet hundreds of new faces which
can be a daunting task: but remem-
ber to keep an open mind – because
as a wise woman once said, life is like
a box of chocolates: you never know
what you’re going to get. So relax,
grab a martini, (shaken, not stirred)
and strike up a conversation with
someone.
Once you talk to enough people
you will undoubtedly come across
the topic of ﬁlms; what your favourite
ﬁlms are and what you watched over
the summer.
Not a ﬁlm buﬀ? Don’t worry, no-
body’s perfect. And frankly, we do
give a damn.
So here’s an oﬀer you can’t refuse:
we have compiled a list of essential
ﬁlms for you, according to their gen-
res. If you are familiar with these, you
won’t be too lost in any kind of ﬁlm
debate. So today consider yourself
the luckiest (wo)man on the face of
the Earth.
Then you’ve got to ask yourself one
question: “Do I feel lucky?” And if
you do, may the force be with you,
go ahead, make our day, and fasten
your seatbelt, because it’s going to be
a bumpy week.

Recently, the British Film Institute
(BFI) released the results of their
celebrated poll, “THE GREATEST
FILMS OF ALL TIME”, in which they
surveyed ﬁlm critics and directors to
list their ten favourite ﬁlms. Now the
Felix Film team, as much as we’d love
to, doesn’t have that kind of time or
resources. And so we decided to split
the ﬁlms up according to the decades
in which they were released. So every
week, we will present you with our
top ﬁlms of each decade, and kicking
things oﬀ, we have the 1930s!
5. Grand Hotel (1932)
With a star-studded MGM cast like
this (the Barrymores, Greta Garbo,
Joan Crawford etc.), very little can
actually go wrong. Set in a luxurious
hotel where supposedly “nothing ever
happens,” the lives, troubles and ro-
mantic tangles of various guests and
staﬀ of the hotel get messy and even-
tually end in sudden murder. It skil-
fully links multiple plot strands and
wildly diﬀerent characters together.
And because of this, the 1932 Oscar
Best Picture winner is considered to
be one of the ﬁrst to handle such hy-
perlink subgenre with wit, smarts and
style.
4. The Wizard of Oz (1939)
It’s a story that is beloved even to this
day, so beloved that it has spawned
various spin-oﬀs and has an insanely
loyal following. No-one can belt out a
tune like Judy Garland, as her Doro-
thy Gale sings “Somewhere Over the
Rainbow” like no other wannabes,
and the insanely colourful magical
land of Oz, further highlighted by
the grim and dusty Kansas is a sight
to behold. The Wicked Witch of the
West (Margaret Hamilton) is one of
cinema’s most memorable villains,
and the ﬁlm carries several unforget-
table lines that always make it into
any “best movie quotes” lists.
3. The 39 Steps (1935)
There are four major ﬁlm adapta-
tions of the adventure novel The
Thirty-Nine Steps, and this is the
most acclaimed one, which is no big
surprise, since Alfred Hitchcock
was the man behind the camera.
In this delightfully fast-paced
comic thriller full of twists
and turns, the story of an
innocent but framed man
on the run (a familiar set-
up for future Hitchcock
ﬁlms to come) is a short
but gripping ride, with
sparkling chemistry between the two
leads. And for those with spare time
and/or money, make sure to check
out the equally outstanding West End
stage play.
2. It Happened One Night
(1934)
Sweeping the Big Five awards at the
Academy Award (Best Picture, Best
Actor, Best Actress, Best Director
and Best Screenplay – a feat that
has been achieved only twice more),
the Oscar win was the golden
start of a glowing, lasting
career of director Frank
Capra who had already
achieved success in
both the silent and
sound eras. Clau-
dette Colbert, who
was convinced she had
ﬁlmed an embarrass-
ing ﬂop, refused to attend the Os-
car ceremony and had to be dragged
back from her holiday to accept the
award when she was announced as
the deserving winner.
1. Gone with the Wind (1939)
Four hours have never felt so short
and its length is one of the ﬁlm’s many
assets, not its downfall, despite what
the number of minutes (224) may
have you believe. Clark Gable’s Rhett,
Vivien Leigh’s Scarlett, Olivia de
Havilland’s Melanie, Hattie McDan-
iel’s Mammy are all remarkable and
cherished characters, and there are
no signs of love surrounding this clas-
sic dying down. A real highlight of the
Hollywood Golden Age, it presents
scale that is rarely seen even in mod-
ern productions. Don’t agree with the
pick? Frankly my dear, I don’t give a
damn.
