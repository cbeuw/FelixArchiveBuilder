ero played at the O2
Brixton Academy on
Saturday as part of
the UK tour of their
new album Between II Worlds. The
adverts had been plastered across
the capital for several weeks leading
shaken, and my friend complained
that his eardrum physically hurt. It’s
safe to say they wanted the music to
be felt.
The three piece’s lead singer
Alana Watson, was not particularly
memorable,as she seemingly mimed
the entire hour and a half set aside
from the last line, where she wished
London good night. At one point
her oversized belt fell off - so that
at least was mildly interesting.
The music played was predictable
and I very much doubt any live
T
he 2014 synthpop
sensation Chvrches
held the biggest headline
gig of their career at a
slightly below capacity Alexandra
Palace on Friday last week. I bought
my tickets from another Imperial
student, but there were plenty flying
around online in the preceding
weeks for less than retail.
The Glaswegian band is currently
touring their second album, Every
Open Eye, which was released in
January this year and they were
supported by DJ and producer Four
Tet,a weird,genre-crossing decision
which I still require an explanation
for.
I feared that the band’s sound
wouldn’t suit the size – 10,000 at
full capacity – of the venue, but
I was happy to be proved wrong
immediately, with new tracks such
as ‘Never Ending Circles’ blasted at
full volume, with loud bass provided
by Iain Cook and synths by Martin
Doherty.
Lauren Mayberry,the lead vocalist,
was confident and commanding
throughout; she provided rambling
banter with her band-mates and the
audience at will. You couldn’t help
but feel she had it all planned, but
honestly who can blame her. When
not singing she was given the task of
beating a drum set placed at centre
stage and dancing around playfully.
The low point of the night came
when Doherty tried his hand at
singing, on the album track ‘High
Enough to Carry You Over’ which
the crowd showed little appreciation
for. This was fortunately quickly
forgotten when Mayberry took the
microphone back for the next song.
A fake encore - as is the norm
- then a slow song followed by a
rousing rendition of ‘Mother we
Share’ left every attendee satisfied
that they got what they paid for,
myself included.
mixing was done, despite the classic
knob twiddling and keyboard
mashing all night, by both Daniel
Stephens and Joseph Ray. The light
show however, was intense, with red
and white strobing the name of the
game.

still barely half packed by the time
midnight rolled around and Nero
took to the stage.
The bass was ridiculous. And not
necessarily in a good way. Both my
