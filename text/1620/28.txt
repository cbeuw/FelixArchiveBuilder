O
n the chilly morning of
Sunday 22nd
November,
21 budding Imperial
College duathletes
prepared to make the 100-mile
journey to the Castle Coombe Race
Circuit in Wiltshire, ready to make
an impression at BUCS Duathlon.
A record 26 competitors had been
whittled down due to unfortunate
injuries and illness – such is the
nature of this demanding sport!
The race started with a two mile
run around the perimeter fence of
the race circuit before mounting
bikes and racing five laps of the
circuit itself. The race finished
with the same two mile run course
albeit at a slower and more painful
pace (unless your name is Matt
Douthewaite).
Marcus Bishop was first to race
in the men’s elite wave. Surrounded
by the perpetual woosh of disc
wheels as duathletes of international
standards sped past him,Marcus put
in a decent performance on one of
the club’s Felt F95 bikes, finishing
in a time of 51:38:4, placing him
206th
overall.
In the elite women’s wave, Leanne
Lyons got a telling off by one of
the Marshalls for her precariously
balanced helmet. Despite this, she
still managed to put in a strong
performance with a time of 56:30:9,
making her the 54th
fastest woman
of the day. Madeleine Whybrow
and Bryony Halcrow followed
shortly after, finishing in times of
57:41:6 and 59:12:2 respectively.
Matt Douthwaite lapped most
of the competition to finish 3rd
in
the mixed wave with an impressive
time of 48:18:2 for a debut
duathlon appearance! His second
run time of 10:53:8, which was
unexpectedly faster than his first,
was the 46th
fastest second run of
the day. Jonny Singh was the fastest
Imperial duathlete on the bike, but
his commendable efforts were not
enough to make up the time he had
lost on Matt during the run, and he
finished in a time of 52:34.
The final TriIC race of 2015 was
concluded with a speedy ride back
to London followed by a refreshing
celebratory pint at the union.

Ultimate frisbee finish 14th
at Nationals
A
fter two days of tough
competition, Imperial’s
ultimate frisbee team,
the discDoctors (dD),
finished 14th
out of 20 teams at
the Division one Mixed Indoor
Nationals that took place in
Coventry on 28-29 November. On
day one in pool play, dD first took
on Heriot Watt University, but
couldn’t keep up and ended the
game with a loss.
Next was a close match against
Oxford, with both teams trading
points the whole way through.
With less than 30 seconds to go and
down 6-8, dD pulled out another
point to put the game into capped
play and eventually universe point
(8-8). Imperial came out on top
with the win at 9-8 (although later
Oxford went on to finish 3rd
in the
tournament).
The last two games of day one
were tough matches against Leeds
and Bristol, both losses with scores
of 6-8 and 3-7, respectively.
On day two, dD sealed two

more wins in bracket play against
Portsmouth (7-5) and University of
Nottingham (7-6), both of whom
had strong players all around. The
final game was for 13th
place in the
tournament against Loughborough.
We started the game slightly slower
than their opponents, giving up a
small lead. But dD ran hard, and
made a comeback to bring it within
a single point. The final point
started with dD on defense, and the
score tied up at 6-6, but in the end
Loughborough refused to give up a
turnover, taking the game at 6-7.
The team had qualified for
nationals, coming in 2nd
in the
East & London Mixed Indoors
Regionals on the weekend of 31
October, losing only to Cambridge.
Now, after taking 1st
place at the
East & London Regionals earlier
in November, dD looks forward to
sending a Men’s team to division
one Men’s Indoor Nationals in
February 2016.
In addition,dD men have a BUCS
outdoor league game against Sussex
on 2nd
December, and Outdoor
Nationals for Mixed, Men’s and
Women’s in March and April 2016.

O
nly one short week after
Kings Round 2, ICSC’s
race team returned
triumphantly to our
favourite dry-slope at Brentwood
for an epic third round. Bringing
almost twice as many racers as last
week – and more than twice as
much fun – ICSC smashed it once
again.
The first team finished 3rd
,
whilst ICSC seconds managed
a respectable 8th
place, with the
majority of racers popping their
dry-slope cherries (and bruising
their arses in the process). This was
all after an incredible round the
week before where we also came
third, meaning our first team have
now qualified for the Kings Finals!
Bussing home with UCL and
Queen Mary’s created a lively
atmosphere as expected. After a
brief interlude of serious equipment
stashing, the London teams went
for a well-deserved pizza before
heading out to celebrate a hard days
work.
