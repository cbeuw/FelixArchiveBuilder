W
hat’s a sabb? Your
guess is as good as
mine, mate. Points
if you know that
sabbatical officers exist, get paid
a hearty £19,000 a year, are given
free accommodation and don’t have
to pay council tax. Sounds pretty
cushy. Bonus points if you know
who any of them are, and answers
on a postcard if you know what any
of us actually do.
As you hurtle down various
A-roads on the way home for the
Christmas holidays, a lot of you
will be wondering what the hell
you’re going to do next year. Maybe
you’re a little behind on the old grad
job front and you’re getting a bit
nervous about your life plan after
that Imperial ID card expires. It
could be this mentality that freaks
people out enough to print hundreds
of posters of their own face, make
an embarrassing video that you’ll
forget is on YouTube until someone
finds it, and cry in Metric when you
win/ don’t win/ get confused as to
whether or not you’ve won.

Maybe you just really love clubs
and societies, really care about safe
spaces and welfare and shit, or you
just have a truly unhealthy obsession
with the academic representation
system. If any of the above sound
like you, it might be worth running.
Hell, it’s definitely worth running
(financially,that is – see above).Ever
tried to strike up a conversation
with someone in the library cafe
by offering them food with your
face printed on it? It’s character
building. If you’ve done door-to-
door canvassing for your local MP,
this’ll be a breeze, since presumably,
no-one you’d be campaigning for
this time is guilty of a war crime.
This week, we’ve featured an
interview with the union president,
and it got someone in the comment
section a little riled. Do sabbs need
to be 100% representational of
the student body? Should we have
Facebook polls over every desk the
union purchases? Probably not.
We all vote for the sabbs most
representative of our views and then
hope they do what we want them
to. And essentially they do. I can
safely say we’re obsessed with our
work and are always thinking about
student welfare, club budgeting,
or producing tip-top content for
millennials.
We’re paid to care, so use us,
don’t abuse us and be kind, because
arguably, we’re just as clueless as to
how to get good stuff done as you
are.

Letters (kinda)
In response to ‘Feminism isn’t just
for girls’, Issue 1613
Dear Ed,
I was glad to read the Angry
Grad’s article “Feminism isn’t just
for girls”in the 13th
November issue,
and I could not agree more with
the sentiment behind the title. The
author alludes to the fact that the
actions and beliefs of some of the
more extreme schools of feminism
not only dissuade people from
associating with the title, but also
are often used by opponents of
feminism to diminish the whole
movement.
I would like to share an idea,
which I hope the Angry Grad and
others adopt, in order to tear down
this common straw-man fallacy
and evade some of the mistargeted
criticism that the majority of
feminists face. It all comes down to
a matter of precision.
Saying ‘I’m a feminist’ really
says very little about one’s
ideological standpoint. It is no
more descriptive than saying ‘ I’m
a Labour supporter’. Well are you
a Blairite or a Corbynite? These
views are incredibly different, often
contradictory and only loosely
related. The more extreme schools
of feminism (radical, French,
separatist etc) generally call for the
whole-scale change of the structure
of society, whereas liberal feminism
predominately strive for gender
equality in the current society from
a universal-rights based standpoint.
Many people would feel deeply
uncomfortable associating with the
more extreme views, and one can
see how “I’m a feminist” could be
interpreted in all manner of ways.
As such, there is much to be gained
by being more precise about our
views.
Most people who describe
themselves as “feminist” mean
“liberal feminist”. This stems
from the idea of equality for all,
irrespective of gender, race, religion,
disability, sexual-preference etc.
which is (thankfully) something
on which most people can agree. I
fall into this category and I suspect
Angry Grad does too.
Currently the liberal feminists
do not identify strongly enough.
We allow the extremes of any
movement to yell louder, dominate
the headlines and often tarnish the
reputation of the whole movement.
This is putting off would-be
sympathisers and allowing the
opposition to tar all feminists with
the same brush.
If we want to see the income gap
disappear and an equal number of
women in positions of power, then
the mainstream movement needs
to identify themselves as such. It
begins with each liberal feminist
identifying themselves and spreads
until we have a critical mass.

I wouldn’t dare put words in
Angry Grad’s mouth, mate. She’s
well scary.

In response to ‘Union spends five
grand on desk’, Issue 1619
[REDACTED] has got the
trustee board to increase his wages
to over £80k while other staff were
made redundant to cut costs. Long
term staff were let go and replaced
with inexperienced new people in
the name of cutting staff wages.
This is just a small example of the
control exerted by the top bosses at
the union while they hide behind
“student trustees”. The truth is
our sabbs do nothing but seal and
stamp on what they want to do.
This is why a lot of major changes
take place over summer before the
new sabbs completely know what’s
happening. There is a real focus on
increasing revenue to make all this
seem worthwhile, which is why
FiveSixEight makes over £250k a
year in profit.This is the money that
the union says they invest in clubs,
but club money is provided in grant
by the college. The total pot for
money for clubs were increased for
the first time last year but saw a cut
for the previous five years.There was
a time the total pot was over £400k.
‘Anon knows’ (online)
FELIX can neither confirm nor
deny the above statements. Gee,
and we thought the £5000 light-up
desk pissed *us* off.
-Ed.
