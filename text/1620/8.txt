FELIX does the Kimposium
That big bum thing is taking over the world and we should pay close attention

L
ast week, in a world first,
an academic conference
on the Kardashians was
held at Brunel University
and if I’m honest, it led me into an
existential crisis. It’s hard looking
society in the eye, but someone’s got
to do it. We know it’s not science
in the form many at Imperial are
familiar with, but it’s social science,
and just as important.
Contrary to what many might
have thought, Kimposium[sic] was
not a celebration of the Kardashian
phenomenon but a discussion of a
range of important social issues,
through the prism of one of the
world’s most recognizable families.
The Kardashian family has occupied
the public spotlight for almost a
decade now and since 2007, has
spawned 5 reality TV spin-offs,
a clothing franchise, countless
products, a modelling career and
a disturbing home made video,
among other things.
The effect reality TV has had
on the life and success of the
Kardashians might be obvious, but
the interaction of the family with its
social context is more complicated
than would appear at first glance.
Intricate relationships of race
politics, body image, social media
curation, and brand management
have resulted in a show that
provides a fascinating glimpse of
contemporary society.
Kimposium aimed to shed light on
exactly these intricate relationships
through a healthy discussion, open
to the public. Brunel invited a
range of speakers from all over the
country and beyond, not limited to
academics, but also including artists,
fashion and culture writers and
bloggers.Talks took the audience on
a 10-hour journey through the realm
of reality TV, its effect on image in
21st
century society, the broadcasting
of trauma and transitions through
the prism of twitter, post-feminism,
body shape and size, and even
genetics.
There was a similarly a wide range
of attendees, across all levels of
education and beyond, all of who
seemed to thoroughly enjoy the
discussion. Sophie O’Connell, a
local 6th
form student encouraged
by her sociology teacher to go,
said she was very excited to attend
the Conference. “We wanted to
see ‘Fatness, Thinness and Race’,
because now that she’s having a baby
she’s getting criticised for gaining
weight, which obviously you do.
They’ve changed social media and a
lot of girls’ perspective of how they
should look and how they should
feel, especially twitter, and have had
a massive impact on our generation
as a whole”.
Similarly positive was the
experience of Hannah Smart,
a photography student from
Nottingham Trent University,doing
her dissertation on women in self-
portraits. “It was really good, very
in. During the fifth segment,
Katherine Appleford and Cecilia
Cappel from Kingston University
talked about the progression of
western beauty ideals and their
shift of focus from size to shape.
The Kingston Academics looked at
the historical and cultural context
of white vs. black beauty and the
effect Kim Kardashian’s idolization
has had across the white and black
population,with more white women
striving to get that mega-butt
and more black women seeing an
increase in eating disorders across
their community, possibly as a result
of trying to attain the unattainable
Kim K shape.
Then Gemma Cobb from the
University of Essex took over and
talked about anorexia nervosa and
the almost eugenic mind frame
inconspicuously prevalent in not
only the anorexic subculture (forced
underground due to regulations
against the promotion of mental
illness), but also society. She looked
at the fixation of the community
with Kendal Jenner (half-sister
of Kim Kardashian), with many
members treating her as a ‘thinspo’
(thinspirational, possessing a
slim body to aspire to). She
pointed out the prevalent trend of
condemnation of the Kardashian
genes, as ‘trashy’ and the danger
of them contaminating the ‘lovely’
Jenner gene pool that must be
responsible for everything ‘pleasant’
about Kendal, differentiating her
from her sisters.

The session raised interesting
points about the intercontextuality
of race and beauty and the complex
politics underlying the dynamic.
Kimposium ended on a strong
note with a plenary from Professor
Paula-Irene Villa, who summed
up the discussions and talked
about feminism, body image and
pornographic liberation.
The Kardashians, for better or for
worse, are one of our time’s ‘hottest’
cultural products and are invaluable
in understanding many current
social issues and trends. Dismissing
them as unimportant would be
short-sighted and an inexcusable
omission of this decade’s cultural
history and understanding.
Of course I’m not advocating
consumption of said product.
There are certainly thousands if not
millions of better things one could
do with their time,including staring
at a freshly painted white wall, but
as long as the consumption of the
‘’Kardashian Bun’’ is as widespread
as it is today, the show remains a
goldmine for social scientists and
provides a window into modern
society and some of its more subtle,
unnerving aspects.
Session
five:
Fatness,
Thinness
and Race
different to anything I’ve been to
or seen at university. It’s particularly
interesting how different it is and
controversial from the outside
perspective, maybe from people
who might think this is ridiculous
or a waste of time. Then you come
to something like this and realise
there’s much more than the TV
program or their brand, there’s a lot
more depth.”
