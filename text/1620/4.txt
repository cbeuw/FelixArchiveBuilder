Anne Robinson’s dismay at Kensington sculpture
T
his week, plans to install
a new sculpture on the
roundabout just off
Gloucester Road were
damned by ex-presenter of The
Weakest Link and Watchdog, Anne
Robinson.
Robinson, whose infamous
glare made her a TV staple in the
noughties, said the £100,000 price
tag was too much, considering the
UK is enduring “times of austerity”.
Pointing out that the public art was
tucked away on the traffic island,
which was only really overlooked
by the Michelin starred Launceston
Place restaurant, she said, “It’s
ludicrous to think that school-
run mums and white van men will
stop to admire a sculpture at that
junction”.

Junior doctor strikes called off
O
n Monday, it was
announced that the
junior doctor strikes that
had been planned for
this Wednesday and two other dates
in December had been suspended,
due to a last-minute breakthrough
in negotiations between the British
Medical Association (BMA) and
the government over proposed
contract changes.
Many were angered when Jeremy
Hunt, the controversial health
secretary who has spearheaded
the proposed changes, tweeted:
“Victory for common sense. Strike
shouldn’t have been called w/o
talking to govt first but great for 7
day services”, along with a link to
the Acas statement announcing the
strikes had been called off.
The talks have recently been
reopened with the help of Acas’
negotiation services, after breaking
down last year. Junior doctors voted
overwhelmingly in favour of strike
action on the 19th
of November.
The first strike was planned for this
Wednesday, and would have seen
junior doctors walk out in every
department except emergency care.
Two subsequent strikes would have
been full junior doctor walk-outs.
Speaking to the Mail on Sunday
after the strike ballot result was
announced, Hunt accused pro-
strike junior doctors of “bullying”
on social media, and compared the
NHS on the weekends to flying in
a plane “without a co-pilot”. He
called the BMA the “toughest union
of the lot”, alluding to the fact that

You are a terrible waste of money, goodbye
covered by well-maintained shrubs.
The sharp-tongued presenter
maintained that Kensington and
Chelsea were using the new statue
as an excuse to “not to have to weed
and plant” in the small patch.
She said she’d rather the money
were spent on less frivolous ventures,
such as “my day care in years to
come”.
The local resident’s association
has been mulling over proposals
for the centrepiece, submitted by
several notable sculptors. Charles
Hadcock, whose work has been
displayed in and around Canary
Wharf, proposed a globe, while
Peter Randall-Page, who has work
in the permanent collection of the
British Museum, has proposed a
lizard-like statue.
The sculpture would be funded
by next door’s £600m new build,
One Kensington Place. The council
insists on large developments like
this donating money for public
art, with local councillor, Daniel
Moylan saying the funds are not
public money, and can only be used
for this purpose.
Robinson remarked that she
would make a complaint against
the plans before the deadline for
consultation, which was today.
Watch this space, literally.
a historical doctor’s union resisted
the initial construction of the NHS.
He neglected to mention that this
opposition lasted just two months
and was back in 1948. The same
newspaper broke the news of the
strike ballot result as ‘Dirty tricks of
strike doctors’, and repeatedly refers
to activist Anna Warrington as the
campaign’s ‘strike cheerleader’.
Most GP
practices
were
unaffected
Most GP practices were
unaffected,but thousands of hospital
appointments and operations had
alreadybeencancelledinpreparation
for the strikes. However, junior
doctors argue that strike action was
the only option left to demonstrate
to the government how serious the
situation regarding work hours and
pay was.The BMA have always said
that patient safety was their main
concern, with strikes being the
last resort in a desperate situation.
Proposed contract changes would
see working hours currently classed
as unsociable be reclassified, which
the BMA says will see junior doctors
work “dangerously long hours” and
recieve a significant pay cut.
She said the
£100,000
price tag was
too much
