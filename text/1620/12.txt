Ben Hur turns pirate-y in nonsensical panto

B
en Hur: a metaplay of
misfortune, mischief
and… many, many
manekins. Based on the
1959 film, Ben. the heir to the Hur
estate, is accused of treason against
the emperor. He is taken slave only
to be rescued to wreak his revenge.
Having not seen the film the
parody was a little disjointed
although you could still appreciate
its subtle humour. That said, it was
somewhat over shadowed by the
assaultative slapstick dominating
every scene. Not to mention an
irrelevant foray into a lovesick cast
member’s infatuation with the
leading actress. Despite this, it was
redeemed by occasional, hysterical
bouts of cunning punning.
With the protagonist giving a
somewhat stilted introduction in
the reccurring pantoesque theme,
before retreating backstage. After
a clattering and a hullabaloo of
costume change the play sprang into
audience members given cue cards.
This all ended in a piraty climax.
The second half dithered as the
rhythm and plot started to slide.We
action, or rather trotted in on three
camels to a nativity scene featuring
Mary and the three kings revealing
the entire four membered cast!
Despite each of the three auxillary
actors often switching characters
to help with plot development,
I admired how each of them
maintained an identity with each
of their characters. This created
an undercurrent which helped
propel the characters through the
whirlwind storyline. A perplexed
old man, a dreamy young woman
and a vexed Welshman.
Initially. I was fairly disenchanted
as the play completely failed to pass
the Bechdel test, as most of the
females were pretty darn flakey!
However, the homogeneity of these
characters only served to create a
necessary structural lifeline to the
otherwise chaotic play.
The panto style continued with a
dabble into audience participation,
when the characters jumped out
of character to throw the audience
into a sinking slave ship. Each part
of the auditorium were given certain
phrases to shout, with a few chosen
meandered nonsensically around a
shifty sea captain and a leper colony,
although it did provide an amusing
dance routine.
To wrap up this play provides an
unpretentious slapstick affair. It is a
perfect panto preview for those who
just can’t wait for Christmas.
Love and lust in Lulu
F
rank Wedekind’s Lulu
is a story of seduction
and tragedy. Choosing
adjectives to describe
Nicholas Wright’s adaptation of this
controversial nineteenth-century
play is challenging. It’s humorous
at first, Lulu (though she is known
by a variety of names) works her
way through several husbands in
German high society and gains
considerable notoriety. She enjoys
her power, the attention she receives
and the privilege of wealth.
However, through the play’s five
acts, Lulu takes on a darker tone.
Fluid set changes between acts
are accompanied by Alex Hall’s
haunting score, and a new actress
playing Lulu. Each actress brings
with her continuity, but an evolving
personality. Leonie Benesch is
the intention. Lulu finishes on
a profoundly unsettling note – a
note that doesn’t finish but fades
into infinity. Wedekind himself
was a man with a prodigious sex
life, frequenting prostitutes and
eventually contracting syphilis. He
sends vivid messages about the
dangers of narcissism, lust and sex.
In fact, it’s so starkly portrayed in
Lulu that the programme includes
a double-page spread on sexual
compulsivity, including contact
details for Victim Support and
Sexual Compulsives Anonymous.
Competent direction by Christian
Burgess marries well with Johanna
Town’s eerie lighting and Erin
Witton’s effective soundscapes.
This is also one of the few plays I’ve
attended that also includes a video
designer (Matthew Ferguson) that
adds an especially dramatic turn to
one scene.
Ifyou’reafter‘funforallthefamily’,
try Elf: The Musical (Dominion
Theatre). Lulu is hard-hitting and
bordering on melodramatic. It is
thought-provoking and leaves you
pondering the complexities of the
human psyche. Guildhall’s final-
year actors and musicians are oozing
with talent, and they tackled this
brave play with sophistication.

extremely flirtatious, somewhat
arrogant and manipulative. Claudia
Jolly is slyly intelligent, while Ellen
Gibbon’s is wracked by tragedy.
For me, Countess Geschwitz
(played by Bessie Carter) was
the highlight of the show; her
performance is heart-breaking.
While Rodrigo (Nicholas
Richardson) adds a playful element,
and Schigolch (Paul Gorostidi) is
impossible to take your eyes off with
his energetic (perhaps over-acted)
performance, Geschwitz suffers.
She is bullied, but remains loyal,
and is one of the few characters who
possesses a genuine love rather than
lust.
It’s a complex play that could be
interpreted in many different ways.
Some may see it as horrendously
misogynistic, while others will
praise the strength of Lulu’s
individual personality. Generally,
the story is coherent, but I felt
that more foreshadowing of future
events and characters was in order.
Lulu lacks a quest – what does she
actually want? What are any of the
characters attempting to achieve?
It’s unclear, and an out-of-the-blue
climax left me craving some sense of
epilogue or resolution.
There isn’t any, and perhaps that’s
