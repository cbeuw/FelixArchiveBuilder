Whaling in forbidden waters
Japan storms into the Southern Ocean disregarding international ban
T
he International Court
of Justice sought to wave
goodbye to the whaling
industry, until recent
pressures arose from Japan, who
seek to continue exploiting the
ocean’s riches for so called “scientific
research”.Missions to kill 333 minke
whales have brewed up a storm
in the international community,
with Japan encountering fierce
opposition from countries such as
Australia and New Zealand.
The Australian Environmental
Minister stated that ‘We do not
accept in any way, shape or form
the concept of killing whales for
so-called scientific research’. Japan
has been consistent, stating that its
whaling activities are vital for the
progress of science. Four vessels left

The discovery of more mysterious fast radio bursts leave scientists flummoxed
W
e all know that
space is a vacuum
and that all those
Star Wars space
explosions would never be heard.
But at the same time, the universe
is still full of waves of energy
sent outwards from their sources,
like infinite ripples through an
empty pond, eventually landing on
Earth’s remote shores. Finding and
measuring them all is a painstaking
task carried out all over the world
by scientists and technicians, with
many still remaining outside our
understanding.
Some of these patient folks are
located about five hours inland
from Sydney, Australia in the small,
unassuming town of Parkes. With
not much else going on,it is host to a
64 meter telescope called the Parkes
Observatory. Radio wave data from
Tuesday, preying on the Southern
Ocean.The expedition is due to end
March 2016.
However, this is one expedition
of many, planned under project
NEWREP-A, scheduled to last
twelve years, until 2026/27. 4000
minke whales will be slaughtered
under the program. The IUCN
red list considers Antarctic minke
whale populations as ‘data deficient’
making it impossible to access
ecological status. Are populations
threatened? Near extinction? Least
concern? We don’t know.
The level of endagerment would
severely affect the justification for
whaling. Hence we are faced with
a snag. More scientific research
of the Antarctic minke whale
populations is needed, and killing
mammals for scientific research is
permitted. Japan argues that only
lethal methods can be used for
assessments of whale age-at-sexual
maturity valuations. However, is
this abuse of the loopholes in a law
supporting scientific research?
Sea Shepherds CEO, Captain
Alex Cornelissen suggests that
Japan’s whale hunt should be
regarded as a criminal act,breaching
international law protecting the
Southern Ocean and warns that his
crew and will intervene if necessary,
to prevent such crimes.
Whether Japan’s declarations
are honest or not, there is a need
for more scientific research of the
Antarctic’s minke whale populations
for a thorough assessment of the
species’ ecological health. However,
diving in with plans to kill 4000
minke whales presents a high
element of risk to a population with
so many unknowns. It is especially
disturbing when such proposed
research is being carried out by
a country heavily involved in the
whaling industry.
both the deep and the near recesses
of the universe has been collected
here for over 50 years.
In 2007, scientists at the
observatory discovered never-
before-seen highly energetic pulses
of radio waves in their archival data
from 2001, which they called ‘fast
radio bursts’.Carried into our galaxy
from billions of light years away,
these fast radio bursts only last for
a few thousandths of a second, but
produce as much energy as the sun
does in a day.
Radio waves range from low to
high frequency and interact with
free electrons as they travel on their
cosmic voyages. These interactions
slow down low frequency radio
waves, which arrive later than high
frequency ones.This is known as the
dispersion measure and allows us to
measure cosmic distances.
In the space signals of fast
radio bursts, there is a mysterious
mathematical pattern in the
dispersion measure, where the delay
between the arrival of low and high
frequency radio waves is almost
always a multiple of 187.5. An
initial superficial explanation could
be that each recorded burst occurred
at exactly the same distance from
Earth, but that is unlikely.
No one has managed to
produce a theory for this bizarre
phenomenon of equal distancing
between the wavelengths. This
lack of explanation has led some
space-minded citizens to argue for
extra-terrestrial origins. However,
scientists are quick to distance
themselves from these claims,
pointing out the small sample sizes
as skewing the perception of pattern
identification, which may disappear
in larger datasets.
Though it has been estimated that
about 10,000 of these bursts reach
the earth every day, researchers
have only found them in their
records 15 times, with only one
ever having been observed live,
on May 14, 2014. Five of these
events were just discovered recently,
including a previously unseen twin-
burst. Results were published in
the Monthly Notices of the Royal
Astronomical Society last week
Scientists on the investigation
were excitedly tweeting the
discovery of the new events, which

effect
was all the more relevant since
a paper was also just released in
Astrophysical Journal Letters
identifying a potential source as the
cosmic union of a black hole and
neutron star.
While their source is still
definitively unknown, these fast
radio bursts are an exciting new
field in astrophysical studies.
Researchers at the University of
British Columbia are building a
telescope to measure them, called
CHIME (Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experience).
Hoping to gather data from tens of
thousands of these events, they plan
to use the information to construct
a 3D map of matter in the universe.
With a cloud of mystery still
surrounding these fast radio bursts,
we will undoubtedly keep our eyes
and telescopes scanning the sky to
look for more events, in the hopes
of understandingthe origins of these
puzzling ripples in our cosmic pond.
