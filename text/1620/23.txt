Leave Kanye alone
A deeper look at one of the most influential artist of the millennium
something pretty much exclusive
to punk and metal. Both white
dominated genres.
Provocative visuals flash behind
him as he performs: three inverted
Ku Klux Klan members loom
against a white background, their
traditionally white uniform flipped
black. The imagery continues in the
B&W ‘BLKKK SKKKN HEAD’
music video, where naked CGI
Kanyes of various shapes and size
spaz out to the tune.The video ends
with five black men in black KKK
hoods advancing on the viewer.
Another instance of white racism
stained black; disarmed.
The SNL performance mimics
that of a rock star. Ye’s intensity
burns through the screen as he
wields the mic stand, studded
leather jacket contentiously worn
over a low-cut t-shirt.The ‘rock star’
is another exclusively white concept
that Kanye’s been trying to sort out.
He’s repeatedly appointing himself
the title of ‘greatest living rock
star,’ even screaming it repeatedly
in the face of an overwhelming
white crowd of near 100 thousand
(at Glastonbury at that - a festival
with roots entrenched firmly in
rock & roll). The dude’s persona
is the closest thing we have to the
rock stars of old in pop culture (by
a LONG shot), so why’s everyone
getting so pissed off? ‘Rap’s the new
feature listed on the track list is
‘God,’ on the track ‘I Am a God.’
The song features such absurdities
as ‘In a French-ass restaurant.
Hurry up with my damn croissants!
I am a God.’If said by anyone other
than Ye, nobody’d be doubting their
insincerity. He knows this; dude’s
toying with how the public perceives
him. America’s bred a culture of
self-hatred into its black populace.
Everyone’s happy with black
musicians referring to themselves
as gangsters, drug dealers, n*ggas…
But a god? Ye’s inverted hyperbole
aims to incite rage.
By adopting the moniker ‘Yeezus’,
Kanye’s inserting himself further
into white iconography: a quick
glance through Christian artwork
highlights Jesus as the most
recognisable white figure in the
entire world.The concept’s extended
in his Yeezus tour theatrics, where
‘White Jesus’ comes on stage for a
quick what-up.
Kanye is repeatedly highlighting
his blackness by inserting it into
everywhere society tells him it
doesn’t belong. Black timbs all in
your couch again. Black dick all in
your spouse again.
“Soon as they like you, make ‘em
unlike you.”
A great deal of effort has gone
into making ‘Bound 2’ unlikeable
and it worked: it’s the 8th
most
disliked video on YouTube, ever.
When the original (much shittier)
‘Hooked On a Feeling’ video has a
10 to 1 like-to-dislike ratio with a
fifth of the views of ‘Bound 2,’ you
can’t help but wonder whether the
racial overtones played a hand in its
infamy.
It’s clear that Kanye doesn’t
mind exposing himself to ridicule.
He became the first mainstream
artist in a hyper-masculine genre
to expose himself emotionally,
mourning the demise of both his
mother and engagement on the
new-wave autotuned record 808s
and Heartbreaks. A quick glance
through his previous music videos
shows he knows how to make a
good one; the gorgeous self-directed
‘Runaway’ film speaks for itself. It’s
pretty insulting to think that he
lacks the self-awareness to realise
how tasteless ‘Bound 2’ looks.
Which leads me to question his
oval office aspirations. Running
against an incumbent president
is political suicide, and I don’t
think Kanye winning a nationwide
popularity contest is going to
happen anytime soon. When asked
about his policy ideas directly after
the announcement, a rare smile
escaped: ‘Everybody gets Yeezys.’
YEEZY2020 highlighted the
insanity of an unqualified celebrity
thinking he can run the U.S.A.
Something topical starting with T
and ending with P(rick) springs to
mind.
“Pop culture tries to force-feed a
dumbed down version of everything.
People try to act like the fans are
dumb.”
From crashing ballet and hip-hop
together in ‘Runaway’ to taking
inspiration from the Alejandro
Jodorowsky directed arthouse film
‘The Holy Mountain’ for the Yeezus
tour, Kanye’s been bringing fine art
to pop culture in an progressively
more mature manner. October saw
the first release of his collaboration
with Pulitzer Prize winning
composer Caroline Shaw. The
rework of ‘Say You Will’ employs
her voice as a string instrument:
puckering pizzicato vocals flutter
around Kanye’s autotuned laments
before swelling in a jaw-droppingly
serene crescendo. It’s pretty damn
good.
Does an artist have to subscribe
to our preconceived notions of how
they should look, act or talk like in
order to deserve our respect? The
notion that popularity automatically
equates to unsophistication is
irritatingly snobbish. Applying
semiotics to Kanye West’s post-
Swiftgate output opens up bounds
of subtext (check out his SNL-40 or
DNC performance- I could go on
about his subversive trolling of the
Glastonbury audience).
People love to laugh at the
apparent stupidity of others.
Entertainers have been exploiting
this idea for ages- just look at
clowns and marketing maestro DJ
Khaled. It’s far easier to poke fun at
Kanye’s eccentricities than to take
him seriously as an artist. Almost
too easy.
But what if he’s inviting us to
make fun of him?
“Think you’re laughin’at me? Nah,
nah, I laugh at y’all/ …. /All they
shit they talk, all the shit they write,
oh, I love it.”

Back to the album. The only

I
am a pop artist. My medium is
public opinion, and the world
is my canvas.”
As the most despised figure
of today’s pop culture pantheon,
you’d think Mr. Michelangelo-
with-a-mic would know how to use
his medium better.
But what if we take him seriously?
“I am standing up and telling
you: I am Warhol. I am the number
one most impactful artist of our
generation.”
When persistent tall talk like
this makes Kanye’s diamond-gated
mouth sound like my arse after a
super-noodle binge,taking anything
he says seriously is a pretty big ask.
But, what if he’s right? What if
he’s actually what he claims to be– a
Louis Vuitton garbed Lichtenstein?
The dude makes really fucking
good music. That’s a pretty safe
statement (if this upsets u hmu 4
a good otolaryngologist). Outside
of that he’s kind of a walking
punchline. Anyone who knows me
will know I’m pretty avid advocate
of Team-Yeezy (avid/obsessive;
potay-to/potah-to), so I’m here to
expose the truth.
Kanye West is a criminally
underrated post-modern
performance artist.
I know how this sounds (believe
me, my mates have made sure I
know EXACTLY how it sounds),
but bear with me. Let’s start with
an example - the ‘Bound 2’ music
video. If you haven’t seen it, the
video begins with cheesy stock
landscape clips before switching
between Kanye awkwardly dancing
and Kanye awkwardly riding a
motorcycle (often accompanied
by the beloved millennial form of
Mary Magdalen, Kim Kardashian
West). All scenes are shot against
a poorly disguised green screen,
providing colourfully stylized (but
ultimately trashy) backdrops to
Kimye’s shenanigans. The video’s
racked up a tidy 400,000 dislikes on
YouTube; the people aren’t a fan.
The people have missed the point.
‘Bound 2’ is a genius inversion of
the ‘Hooked on a Feeling’ music
video by newly renamed DavidHoff
(he wanted to ‘drop the Hassle’from
his name - no, seriously, google it),
its release and reception all part of a
devilishly sly performance art piece
aiming to highlight and disarm
America’s latent cultural racism.
‘Hooked on a Feeling’are uncannily
similar. Take any Bound 2 shot, and
you can find a corresponding shot in
‘Feeling’ with the exact same colour
gradient.
The whole fake motorcycle is
straight from ‘Feeling.’ Kanye’s odd
expressions when he busts in after
the intro? Imitating Hasselhoff’s
ok-Mitch-it ’s-time-to-look-
sexy stare at the start of ‘Feeling.’
Kanye spreading his wings in an
inexplicable G-6 impression? Also
straight from the Hoff.
As science boffins we can all agree
that correlation does not imply
causation, so let’s dig a little deeper.
During the ‘hooga hooga ooga
chaka’ refrain of ‘Feeling,’ footage of
a sunglasses clad Hasselhoff runs in
the background. His t-shirt’s tucked
into his pulled up cargo shorts as he
prances around a group of African
tribesmen. Dude’s looking pretty
cool. A second Hasselhoff (let’s call
him Hoff-B) also appears, bopping
around with a tribal weaponry,
otherwise kitted out in safari gear.
It’s as if Hoff-B, singing ‘ooga
ooga,’ brandishing native weapons,
is taunting the Africans by inserting
himself into their culture.
“They see a black man with a white
woman at the top floor, they gone
come to kill King Kong/Middle
America packed in/Came to see me
in my black skin”
Now in Bound 2, Kanye is either
dressed in lumberjack attire or a
white-trash t shirt. Also exclusive

dark as possible, while the opposite
stands for Kim: contrasting their
skin tones, highlighting their super-
publicized interracial relationship.
The video was debuted on the Ellen
DeGeneres Show: a talk show
most successful in the middle-aged
white female demographic. Hardly
Kanye’s target audience… So why
all the theatrics?
Kanye West has brilliantly
reversed ‘Hooked On A Feeling,’
appropriating Americana culture
and taunting ‘middle America’ with
scenes of a black man riding into
the sunset with his Caucasian wife.
“It’s my flag now- now what you
gonna do?”
Later that year, Kanye started
rocking the confederate flag. A
mainstay of redneck iconography,
this stirred up quite a fuss, pissing
off both racists and those who’d
actually experienced racism at its
hands. Whether appropriate or not,
by adopting the historically racist
logo, Kanye’s made strides towards
disarming it, drawing parallels with
the appropriation of n*gger. There
seems to be a theme here.
“But the guy really, really, really
is talented… No one’s near doing
what he’s doing, it’s not even on the
same planet.”- Lou Reed on Yeezus
Kanye’s pretty Lynchian in the
opacity of his art; what little he’s
divulged about his 6th
LP Yeezus
has amounted to ‘fashion world
marginalisin me cos im black NEW
SLAVES fuk u hedi slimane.’
Yeezus has had people stumped for
a while, but looking at the album
through the lens of a black man
appropriating inaccessible white
culture starts to clear the fog.
Ye’s made an angry, controversial
record in frustration at his inability
to break into the fashion industry.
As an outspoken black man, he
felt he couldn’t insert himself
into the fashion world, so he’s
inserting himself into anything
and everything else that’s similarly
uncharted territory.
The track ‘Black Skinhead’
(paradox much?) was first heard
with a ferocious performance live
on SNL. Sonically, the song’s closer
to rock than hip-hop; cavernous
drums chug away around a gnarly
guitar-riff while Marilyn Manson-
esque gasps provide the essential
earworm. Kanye gets his scream on;

The visuals of ‘Bound 2’ and

and Kim having as much fun as
you can have without your clothes
