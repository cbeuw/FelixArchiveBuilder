BEIT BASEMENT
PROJECT DEEMED
‘INFERIOR’
A
report, commissioned
on behalf of Imperial
CollegeUnion,described
work completed on
Beit’s west basement as having
created a facility “considered to be
very much inferior to that which
existed before, with a significant
portion of it being unusable.”
It also referred to shortcomings in
the design and construction of the
IC Radio studio,Jazz and Rock,and
control rooms,which has led to poor
soundproofing between the spaces.
Several clubs are housed in the
west basement, including Jazz and
Rock, and the Media societies,
and it is these that have been most
affected.
Planning for the basement
redevelopment began in 2013,
when College proposed converting
Beit’s east basement into additional
bedrooms for Beit Hall.Much of the
east basement was used as storage
for union clubs and societies, but
this was to be moved to the west
side, with the overall size of the
space for media clubs shrinking to
make room. In compensation for
the reduction in space, included in
the project would be a much needed

redevelopment of the student media
facilities.
With work completed over the
summer of 2014, and spaces opened
gradually during the winter term,
numerous sound isolation problems
were identified, with several
complaints launched by residents
in Beit hall regarding the levels of
noise coming from the Jazz and
Rock practice room. By the Easter
break, complaints had reached such
a level that the practice room was
closed indefinitely.
The entire cost of refitting
both the east basement with new
bedrooms and the west basement
with new storage and media
facilities was around £2.5 million.
The media facilities alone, including
design, VAT, and furniture cost in
the region of £900,000, with funds
coming from the College. Imperial
College Union then spent a further
£100,000 supplying the space with
equipment.
A union representative told
FELIX that the union would
“continue to work with the College
and Media group societies to resolve
the problems that we are facing with
the facility”.
