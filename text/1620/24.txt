tagline says, it’s anything

A
few weeks ago, without
much promotion or
fanfare, comedian Aziz
Ansari and producer
Alan Yang dropped their new
show, ‘Master of None’; by way of
Netflix. The series’ rapidly growing
popularity and critical acclaim is a
testament to the pervasiveness of
the platform. Centring on twenty-
something ‘Dev Shah’ making
his way through the world; each
episode is dedicated to exploring
one aspect of modern life. In fact,
perhaps the show’s greatest strength
is its ability to highlight the humour
in the seemingly ‘everyday’. In
that regard, it manages to be a
‘situational comedy’ in the truest
sense; where very little of the
plot feels manufactured. Perhaps
counterintuitively, this manages to
make seemingly artificial moments
even funnier.
Through this exploration, ‘MoN’
also tackles a variety of social
episodes maintain a high level of
quality continuing on. All that, of
course, doesn’t mean the show isn’t
without its faults. There are a few
unfunny jokes that tend to go on for
too long, and Aziz’s mugging can
occasionally border on the annoying.
Some characters, Eric Wareheim’s
‘Arnold’ being a particular victim,
come across as one dimensional and
cartoonish; seemingly serving no
real purpose. At times, the acting
issues, from Feminism, to the
representation of minorities in
media, to the supposed ennui and
lack of direction of millennials.
In this viewer’s opinion, the show
handles these with a deft touch.
Rather than serving the viewers
a ham-fisted metaphor sandwich,
Ansari and Yang wisely opt to
guide us to our own realisations.
This is further aided by the diverse
cast and their diverse world views.
There are no real villains here; not
even that guy masturbating on the
subway. Well, okay, maybe he is a
little bit. This cast also highlights
one of the other great strengths
of the show; relatability. There are
characters and situations here that, I
dare say, anyone could identify with.
For me, episode 2, ’Parents’ was a
particular highlight. Here, at least
to me, Ansari perfectly captures
the parent-child dynamic of an
immigrant family.
As has become something of
a norm for new shows, the first
episode is probably the weakest.
Though that’s not to say it’s bad by
any stretch.In general,the following

of those few rare instances where
TV can appeal to both children
and adults. The series features the
main leads ‘Mordecai’, a blue jay,
and ‘Rigby’, a raccoon, who are two
twenty-something park workers.
However, instead of working, they
always prefer to slack off, play video
games, watch TV, drink coffee and
eat pizza and tacos.
What makes the show unique
and so great is the large and wild
directions the show takes with
seemingly ordinary tasks. The most
mundane situations and storylines
you can think of turn into very
interesting plots and subplots that
keep you interested, intrigued and
second guessing as to how exactly
they will wrap up. For example one
time, Mordecai and Rigby go out to
get a grilled cheese sandwich, end
up being mistaken for astronauts
through their lying and then get
stuck in a chamber with a rampaging
sphere of antimatter that threatens
to destroy the entire planet.
As extraordinary as the plots
may be, the show draws a lot of
its strength from having excellent,
well-written characters. When you
meet them, everyone seems fairly
generic with their own traits and
roles. As you progress through
the show though, you see all the
characters get developed and shown
some love at some point or another.
There is literally no character that
hasn’t gotten their own time to shine
to some extent; they’re all really
relatable and have their own issues
that they have to go through. These
issues parallel problems of our own,
such as the struggles of maintaining
a long-distance relationship, trust
issues, sibling rivalry, overcoming
insecurities etc.
The show brings a touch of
nostalgia to the table, capturing
the essence of the older Cartoon
Network shows with a great
atmosphere and a good and likable
cast. It also has a modernised
element, making it feel up to pace
with more modern trends. Given
a lot of the stuff that gets past the
radar, it feels more like an Adult
Swim cartoon wearing the skin of
a Cartoon Network one. There are
several times you may doubt this is
a show written for kids; for example
there is a scene where some of the
characters go on an “acid trip”,
courtesy of a concoction of spicy
foods.
All in all, this is definitely a
fantastic, heart-felt show that will
constantly subvert your expectations
and make you wonder what kind of
tricks and ideas the creative team
will come up with next. With its
episodes only being around 10
minutes long, it is truly a simple and
quick show worth checking out.

seventh season

can also feel slightly wooden. The
worst offenders for this are Dev’s
parents. Although this fast becomes
self-explanatory and endearing once
you know that they are played by
Ansari’s real-life mother and father.
In fact, ironically enough, Dev’s
father ends up being one of the best
characters on the show.
Overall, these minor critiques
don’t really put much of a dent in
the experience, and I would highly
recommend that anyone and
everyone watch it. At the risk of
sounding pretentious, it’s also an
important show; for reasons that
show’s fourth episode ‘Indians on
TV’ illuminates far better than
I could. ‘Master of None’ is that
rare sitcom that manages to be
refreshing, insightful, and, most
importantly, damn funny.
Master of None is available now on
Netflix
W
hat if? It’s a
question that
intrigues, inspires
and the foundation
of many fictions. ‘The Man in the
High Castle’ asks: what would the
world be like if Axis powers had
won World War II? It is not content
with simply offering an alternate
history; the series goes further by
having the character’s in its fictional
universe ask the same question in
reverse.Their ‘what if’ is our reality.
Based on Philip K. Dick’s novel
which contained a novel within a
novel, Frank Spotnitz’s adaption
replaces this literary device with
a series of films within a serialised
television drama. An early glimpse
reveals that these reels of film
show a world where the atom
bombs were dropped on Japan, not
Washington, and where the Allied
powers were ultimately victorious.
The protagonist’s search for these
films to see a glimpse of what the
world could be and to deliver them
to the mysterious ‘Man in the High
Castle.’
Set in 1962, we see what everyday
life is like under fascist rule,whether
in the Pacific States of America
(which the Japanese control) or the
Greater Nazi Reich (taking up most
of Eastern America). The world is
beautifullyrealisedfromtheJapanese
infused San Francisco, decorated
in lanterns and kanji signs, to the
Nazi controlled New York City.
Spotnitz uses famous landmarks to
emphasise the occupation; one of
the most powerful images in the
series shows the screens of Times
Square covered in Nazi insignia.
We see supersonic passenger jets
speed through the sky at a time that
far predates the first flight of the
Concorde; the Nazi’s have brought
order and superior technology to the
people of America. Yet as viewers
with an understanding of the reality
of the Nazi’s and Imperial Japan we
know that this order comes with a
sacrifice: “My father told me what
is was like before the war. He said
every man was free.” Ultimately, the
series plays with our overwhelming
desire for freedom.
The series reminds us of the
horrific views held by the Nazi and
Japanese regimes. In one horrific
scene a high-ranking Japanese
officer commits seppuku. And the
subjugation of the Jewish race is
explored, suggesting that while on
the surface society might seem calm
there are still sinister forces at work.
Rather than showing the
conquerors as completely evil and
heartless, Spotnitz displays their
more human side. We see their
weaknesses, their worries, and their
pain. Many of their actions are
still horrific and coldly calculated,
but regret is often present in the
aftermath. At no point does the
series suggest their actions were just
(or that they are good people), but
it’s not so reductive as to suggest
that every Nazi or Japanese officer is
evil incarnate, a refreshing contrast
to the current political obsession
with good and evil.
‘The Man in the High Castle’
focuses on characters from both
sides of America. The main
protagonists, and members of the
resistance, Juliana Crane (Alexa
Davalos) and Frank Frink (Rupert
Evans) live in San Francisco; their
performances never falter and they
feel appropriate for the time period,
but I never felt fully engaged in their
struggle. Similarly, Joe Blake (Luke
Kleintank) from New York and a
double agent for the Nazi’s rarely
earns the audience’s sympathy.
The most compelling performance
by far comes from Rufus Sewell
who plays John Smith, a high
ranking SS officer. He commands
and dominates every scene,
whether at work or with his family.
There are suggestions that he has
been traumatised by war, and a
particular regret for actions of the
concentration camps.
Similarly, Japanese trade minister
played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is
shown as gentle and thoughtful. In
the midst of a cold war between the
Japanese and the Nazi’s, he keeps a
cool head and as a result is easily the
most likeable character.
Together, these two characters,
both on the side of the enemy, give
a counter narrative that is both
refreshing and progressive.
While there are a few problems
with pacing in the second half,
where the series slows to an
infuriating crawl, ‘The Man in the
High Castle’has the ability to satisfy
your curiosity unlike any other show
this year. Over ten episodes it delves
deep into a convincing world - one
that leaves a lasting impact.
