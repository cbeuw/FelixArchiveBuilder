FOOD
Tradition vs Taste?
FELIX explores chicken tikka, changing tastes, and asks if anyone should
care about whether food is ‘authentic’ or not?
B
orn in the US, to mixed
British/Indian parents,
and having spent the
whole of my recallable
life in Oxford at predominantly
English schools, I don’t consider
myself to be Indian, apart from the
times when I’m reminded of it, and
that’s normally to do with food.
“Where’s the best curry house in
London?” some friends ask, and I’ll
try to explain that I really haven’t
been to that many, before telling
them about the few joints I do know
that are good. “What makes a curry
a curry?” is another favourite along
with having to shut down folks
who go and say, “oh, chicken tikka
masala – you should know – that’s
not really an authentic curry, is it?”.
They both get my hackles up. Who
cares if my grandmother wouldn’t
recognise it? If it’s tasty, it’s a good
recipe and that’s all that matters.
If we didn’t have people who were
pushing boundaries, we wouldn’t
come up with new combinations
and recipes. It’s the only way that
cuisine can advance, and that’s what
I enjoy being part of.
At this point, I do have to say
that there are a few people in my
family who won’t necessarily agree
– my father vs modern Greek
salad was a notable battle. Instead
of a slab of briney feta atop some
coarsely cut onions, cucumber
and beefsteak tomatos, liberally
soused with tart red wine vinegar,
lemon, oregano and olives, we
had a very different interpretation
at a restaurant in Athens. Finely
shredded phyllo pastry enrobed a
stick of feta, the whole ensemble
then fried till crunchy yet soft in
the middle. Alongside it were the
rest of the ingredients, finely diced
(not pureed) and left to marinade
– but for just long enough to still
retain each components’ original
flavours, so that you could dip one
in the other and have the whole
blossom of flavours at once. I loved
it, but my father, who had expected
something a bit more traditional
(read: not enough cheese), was left
disappointed. Needless to say, we
didn’t return.
That has never discouraged me
from presenting traditional dishes
to which I’ve added my own ideas to
my family. In fact, I enjoy surprising
my entire family with the occasional
dish that really is a change from the
staple recipes that I do use from
time to time. This is easier for me
to do with gastronomies I have
read, practiced and experienced. For
example, I’m happy to improvise
an Italian twist on things, and so
when I make a Ragu Bolognese
(spag bol to you heathens), I’ll
add soy and Worcester sauces, a
touch of smoked paprika and some
mushroom ketchup – all of which
boost the meaty depth of the dish.
None of them notice the additions
until I tell them at the very end, at
which point they don’t mind, and
have been converted. Now, that’s
not quite the same as doing a tofu
jalfrezi or suchlike, but it’s still
changing their way of thinking.
Really, this clash of tradition vs
reinterpretation only ever comes to
affect my own cooking in certain
areas – cuisines that I’m not too
well versed in – where I feel that my
attempts to create a dish inspired
by them may completely misuse
an ingredient or idea. This mainly
covers those outside of America/
Europe, the Middle East and the
Subcontinent. I’ll have a stab at
South American – but salmon
for ceviche is not the authentic
kind of fish to use (though given
that every country appears to use
a different one, who knows?) and
plod blindly into the Orient – with
dishes faithfully born from family
favourites, such as Beggar’s Noodles
and Wonton Soup. I have no idea if
I’m using the ingredients correctly
for some of the things we do blithely
get from the Chinese supermarkets,
but the end result tastes good and is
fun along the way.
I mean, don’t get me wrong – as
a family of scientists we naturally
put a lot of research into the recipes
(ok, maybe we’re just obsessive), and
have come up with patiently refined
results that we happily offer up to
people, even if it is our version of
their national dish. Why? Because
it tastes good! At least, it suits our
palates…but that’s a complete
article in itself. Is it traditional? I
honestly couldn’t say.
But, tradition itself is important.
As people shy away from cooking,
a phenomenon that is fortunately
slowing, and choose the convenient
route of ready made food – be it with
ready meals that present (for the
most part) bland, drab versions of
once exciting classics, the memories
of traditional foods can too fade.
All to often, the little intricacies of
dishes are left by the wayside,and so
slowly people forget just how that
particular soup tasted, that pasta
felt or those spices blended. I guess
this culinary history, like so many
languages, is too at risk of being
forgotten. If there aren’t people
appreciating old recipes (and yes,
adding their own twists to them as
well!), those techniques and flavours
will die out! So, at times, I’ll pull
up my dad’s recipe database (I said
we were weird) and look up those
recipes that he’s faithfully copied out
from his grandmothers notes, and
that both he and my mother cooked
for me over many years, and I now
get to teach to my girlfriend. And
I remember exactly why, sometimes,
you don’t need to change anything.
That said, I had some other family
remind me that you can cook a
steak perfectly well in a pan, after I
wrote my previous article on meat.
And yes, they weren’t wrong – it’s
quite an art of basting and flipping,
and the end result does have more
of a grey band – but you get a
delicious fond (that browning on
a pan from frying meat?) that can
form the basis of an amazing pan
sauce, something that my reverse
searing method – with its digital
thermometers and, potentially, high
tech water baths, does not. And to
them, I didn’t have an answer. Was
tradition being usurped by a more
convenient method,where there was
a comparatively low skill barrier?
How could I say that I wasn’t taking
the same convenient route as those
who buy ready meals, as all they’re
looking for is a hassle free meal?
At the end of the day, I strongly
believe food should be about taste
first, and tradition second – but
I know not everyone agrees with
me, nor should they. And so whilst
I won’t be the first to serve up
Christmas pudding with a hint of
chilli to my gran, or serve my dad
that bloody Greek salad, I will
happily enjoy a nibble of chicken
tikka if it comes my way.

it’s a good
