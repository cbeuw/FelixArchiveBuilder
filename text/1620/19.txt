FILM
The top three
westerns
that aren’t
The Good, the
Bad, and the Ugly
W
hen we think of
Westerns we think
of Clint Eastwood.
The final instalment
in Sergio Leone’s ‘Dollars’ trilogy,
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
is considered his quintessential
performance. The very definition of
iconic,it essentially defines an entire
genre. but, at almost three hours it’s
hardly a welcoming introduction for
new fans. Perhaps the following will
prove an easier ride:
The Magnificent Seven
(1960)
A re-working of Kurosawa’s Seven
Samurai, The Magnificent Seven tells
the tale of a gang of heroes coming
together to protect a poor village
from thugs. Here, however, the
bandits are met by gunslingers rather
than Rōnin. Characters are key in
this film and the flawlessly cast set
of heroes does not disappoint, with
Steve McQueen, Yul Brynner, and
Charles Bronson all giving stand
out performances.
Serenity (2005)
How boring would the Western
genre be if it was refined to
grizzled middle-aged men in 1800s
America? The idea of a ‘space
western’makes perfect sense in light
of this film. Serenity picks up where
the infamously-cancelled television
show Firefly left off. Malcolm
Reynolds and his renegade crew
return for one last adventure as they
evade the might of a military regime
and men gone mad at the edge of
space.
Unforgiven (1992)
Told you I couldn’t ignore
Eastwood.Here,he presents a gritty
and realistic take on an established
formula that gives us equal measures
of character development and
thrills. Morgan Freeman and Gene
Hackman join Eastwood on this
tale of revenge, as antihero William
Munney takes on one last job. The
ending scene features some of the
most quotable lines and blood-
pumping action ever put to film.
BEN COLLIER
Black Mass
Dir: Scott Cooper. Script: Mark
Mallouk, Jez Butterworth.
Starring: Johnny Depp, Benedict
Cumberbatch,Dakota Johnson,Joel
Edgerton. 122 minutes.
T
here’s an episode of
David Mitchell’s brilliant
YouTube series Soapbox
in which he talks about
the problem with gangster movies:
one great film about gangsters gets
made in the seventies,he argues,and
suddenly everyone thinks they can
make three hour long dirges filled
with smoky wood-finished rooms,
hilariously thick swear-riddled
accents, and overly masculine
geriatric men droning on and on
about who’s next to get whacked.
He blames The Godfather. It feels
almost unfair to compare any film
to The Godfather, except perhaps The
Godfather Part II, but watching the
Boston-set crime drama Black Mass,
it’s easy to see what he was on about.
Based on ‘true events’, Black
Mass recounts the story of Whitey
Bulger (Johnny Depp), South
Boston’s most notorious (and that’s
saying quite a lot) mobster, and
his rise to kingpin status with the
collaboration of FBI agent John
Connolly (Joel Edgerton). But
while the story itself may be true, so
many similar things have been done
so many times before – fictional or
otherwise – that the subject matter
begins to feel stale within minutes
of the multiple-perspective frame
narration’s rambling beginnings.
The brooding Mafioso sinking into
the cesspool of his own evil, the
corrupt police force, the endless
string of murders – certainly almost
all of this has been done before, and
done much better.
Thankfully Black Mass manages
to set itself apart from the pack
somewhat with a few flash touches
of its own. The functional but by-
the-numbers script is made up
for by the subtly excellent editing:
during most conversations, cuts
between shots of the faces of each
person involved come thick and
fast. With the stone-cold faces but
frantically searching eyes of the
performers, these quick cuts create
a powerful sense of the constant
anxiety and paranoia that comes
with living on the edges of the
law, and the thought that capture
is always hiding right behind the
nearest bush.
The relationship between Bulger
and Connolly gives the movie
a strong emotional pull; it’s not
corruption or bribery that keeps
the agent from spilling the beans,
but a deep friendship forged on the
streets of Southy,and his willingness
to fight for his blood brother even
in the most desperate of times is
something not many films like this
have touched upon as well as this
one does.
What baffles me about gangster
movies is how they unfailingly draw
excellent performances from their
cast. Black Mass is no exception:
Depp’s performance as Bulger has
been rightfully hailed as a searing
return to form, and he hasn’t been
this commanding in a role since
the first Pirates of the Carribbean;
Joel Edgerton as well is on fine
form, flexing his acting muscles
with a wide range of fully believable
emotions. Even ensemble turns are
fantastic: Peter Sarsgaard’s crazed,
cocaine-addicted rat and Corey
Stoll’s FBI bulldog hell-bent on
ending Bulger’s reign have precious
few minutes of screen time each,but
both of them steal every second of
it.
While Black Mass has enough
to make it more worth watching
than most crime flick affairs, it
unfortunately doesn’t quite have
enough to make it much more than
entertaining in passing; it’s all just
a bit normal. Once you’ve seen one
gangster movie, it would appear
you’ve seen them all, and – sad as
the fact is – not every movie can be
The Godfather.
TOM STEPHENS
Unbranded
Dir: Phillip Baribeau. Starring:
Jonny Fitzsimons, Thomas Glover,
Ben Thamer. 106 minutes.
A
warm-hearted, generous
film, Unbranded charts
the journey of four
youngTexan men as they
travel from Mexico to Canada with
a pack of wild, ‘adopted’ mustangs.
Immediately we are introduced
to the high-stakes game they are
playing as, during the opening
minutes, one is kicked hard in the
shoulder, and another desperately
tries to control his bucking bronco.
Despite the vast vistas on display,
during a journey that takes in Idaho,
Utah, Arizona, Montana, and
Wyoming, Unbranded manages to
– like Tommy Lee Jones’ excellent
2014 anti-western The Homesman
– make the classic American
wilderness seem isolatedly bleak,
dangerous, and utterly unforgiving.
Exploring an ideological battle
I had no idea existed, Unbranded
was made to raise awareness about
the plight of the wild horse in
the USA: in the 1970s an act was
passed allowing mustangs to graze
on public land, but this has led to
a ballooning of number, making
it difficult for any other livestock,
and indeed the horses themselves,
to survive. The Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) is responsible
for keeping these numbers down
by keeping horses in captivity,
but adoption rates have dropped
dramatically, and now numerous
horses are kept in cages rather than
roaming free. Activists campaign
against the BML, accusing them of
horse-genocide with a fervour that
could only be found in the USA.
It is an interesting topic, one that
could probably be explored in a
greater amount of detail, although
the film gets us up to scratch. I am
sceptical, however, about the effect
the film will have, since the issue
doesn’t really translate to our small
isle. Furthermore, I don’t know how
much it will encourage people in the
USA: training a mustang takes four
months of hard work, and – as the
film shows – human intervention
is perhaps not what is best for the
horses. Two are struck lame by the
end of the first state, and one dies
before they reach the end.
But the emphasis of the film is
on the companionship of the four
young men, and the dangers of their
difficult journey, and if we see the
film as a document of that, rather
than a campaign flick,it works rather
well. There are elements that seem
excessively cheesy at times – some
arguments between the men seem
to be engineered for the camera –
and some aspects make the entire
thing seem like an advertisement
for Jim Bean bourbon. Despite this,
however, the film’s entertaining
premise, earnest motivations, and
refusal to sugarcoat the dangers of
nature, make it a very worthwhile
watch.

I
s there anyone in here who
believes that God can do
anything?” the energised
Pentecostal preacher Becky
Fischer questions her baying crowd
asthecameracutstoamotherraising
her two uninterested children’s
hands excitedly. The opening scene
of Jesus Camp places the viewer
right in the middle of one of the
services at a Christian children’s
summer camp in North Dakota.
As the scene continues, fast editing
and a haunting score crescendo
to a pandemonium. Parents yell
encouragement as the children and
viewer alike are treated to the first of
many frenzied sermons which come
to be the focus of this film.
This introductory five minutes
alone set the tone perfectly. Telling
the story of this camp and its
leaders, Jesus Camp attempts to
make broader statements about
fundamentalism in America.
A massively hands-off approach is
taken by directors Heidi Ewing and
Rachel Grady, with no voice-overs
or opinions being directly offered
by the pair. This approach works
so well because the ridiculousness
of this church and its inside goings
on are so obvious that comment
is unnecessary. “We got too many
Christian grown-ups who are
fat and lazy,” our morbidly obese
preacher exclaims as the camera
holds on her, and subtle critiques
and digs like this are sprinkled
throughout the film. The actual
opinions of the filmmakers seem
to be reflected in a few small clips
of radio host Mike Papantonio,
who talks of the influence of these
religious groups and their scary
right-wing affiliations. Some would
call his sections slightly forced but I
disagree; the dialogue he eventually
is able to have with Fischer in
particular serves as a perfect
microcosm of political debates
occurring within America.
It is this that allows the film to
go beyond the camp and explore
the wider issues of right wing
politics and literalist Christianity in
America.One scene that particularly
stands out involves a cardboard cut
of George W. Bush featured in one
sermon, where Bush is deistically
praised by the preachers for his pro-
life ideals and commitment to God.
The dangers of religion in American
politics is explored in detail with
the nomination of Samuel Alito – a
heavily conservative Christian, and
friend of Bush – to the Supreme
Court acting as a key example.
A simple, objective glance into
this camp is really all the filmmakers
needed to provide to ensure a solid
documentary. The reason why
Jesus Camp should be considered
amongst some of the modern greats
is the wider comments it makes: the
right wing political and religious
undertones to the camp and the
film give Jesus Camp an interesting
dichotomy – one minute we see the
children exploring caves and playing
in the woods, while the next they
cry,pretend to speak in tongues,and
smash cups labelled ‘Government’.
What we are left with is the
question of whether these children
are being brainwashed, and how
much of a threat these groups pose
to American society. Ewing and
Grady leave that up to you to decide.

further than to say that even the
brave are afraid. That is not to say
that genuine sentimentality did not
feature; it did, but just not when
they were trying to force it upon
you. The addition of a some strange
choices in the story, not least the
small drug-trip scene that featured
(yes, you read that correctly), made
for, on the whole, a slightly jarring
experience.
It wasn’t all mediocre though: the
CGI landscape was more detailed
and gorgeously rendered than any
animated film I have seen before
(and I have seen a lot). With the
entire film set in the open, there are
plenty of immensely beautiful shots
that I could’ve stared at for ages.The
reason this is so important is because
nature has an extremely large role to
play – the true antagonist of the film
is not a dinosaur, but all of nature.
The daunting presence of the
highly realistic storm clouds and
crashing rivers contrasts with the
cartoonish look of Arlo, making
him seem even weaker than he was
before.
With enough humour, warm-
heartedness, and spectacular
scenery, The Good Dinosaur is still an
enjoyable film,but unfortunately for
Pixar it is nothing more than that.

espite an original spin
on the classic ‘Boy &
His Beast’ trope – in
this case, the dinosaur is
the boy, and the human the beast –
Pixar’s latest, The Good Dinosaur, felt
rather childish. And yes, I know it
is a children’s film, but that doesn’t
mean it has to be childish. The
fair amount of violence on screen,
however, leads to a confusion as to
whom the film was truly aimed at.
The story follows a young, fearful
dinosaur named Arlo (Raymond
Ochoa) who gets lost far away from
home, and must make his way back
on a perilous – if not somewhat
disjointed – journey. During this
trek home, he ends up befriending
a ‘critter’, who is actually a primitive
human boy (Jack Bright).
A thin plot with an underlying
message that is neither original
nor subtly put, on the whole the
story has little direction. Focusing
on the fear of the unnoticed child
in a family, the film goes little

Radiator
Dir: Tom Fisher Script: Tom Fisher,

Johnson, Gemma Jones, Daniel
Cerqueira 93 minutes.
R
adiator begins with an
everyday nightmare:
middle-aged Daniel
(Daniel Cerqueira)
receives a phone call from his
elderly mother, Maria (Gemma
Jones), asking him to come up
to their Cumbrian home for a
couple of days, since his ailing
father Leonard (Richard Johnson)
cannot move from the sofa. Once
he arrives at the house, however, it
is clear that things definitely aren’t
right. His father has stubbornly
bunkered down, and is exercising
his tyrannical dominion over Maria;
here is a man who, possibly in the
early stages of dementia,is frustrated
at his reliance on others, and acts
out in the only way he knows how
– psychologically taking charge of
those around him.His cantankerous
nature knows no bounds: in one
scene he complains to Maria that
she has bought the straws ‘with
the corrugated neck’, while in the
next he is seen snipping off their
tops with the precision of an army
major.Their house needs to be set in
order, but Daniel isn’t up to the task.
Instead the amount of clutter in the
house slowly grows, infiltrating on
the edges of everyone’s lives like a
malignancy.
While Leonard’s prickly nature
makes it difficult to warm to him,
Johnson’s effective performance
brings to us a sense of how helpless
Leonard feels, having to get his
wife and child to clean him up after
using the commode. However, the
beating heart of the film is with
Maria, whose internal suffering is
portrayed with extreme pathos by
Jones in a masterful performance.
With a coping mechanism that
doesn’t extend past pottering around
and making tea, Maria’s internal
turmoil is reflected in the dramatic
Cumbrian landscape, which plays a
role in this film similar to that of the
Norfolk Broads in 45Years – another
carefully constructed film about
aging and intimacy. In a world that
seems skewed against aging actors,
it is extremely heartening to see
that films are being made that take
an unflinching look at the nature of
aging, and the effects it can have on
the individual.
That the film was Johnson’s last
performance (he died earlier this
year) adds a sense of poignancy, one
that is reinforced by the fact that
director Tom Fisher has mined deep
within the seams of his family life.
The plot of the film came from his
own experiences with his aging,frail
parents, and Radiator was shot in
his own parent’s house in Cumbria,
left untouched since their deaths.
With shades of Andrew Haigh’s 45
Years and Michael Haneke’s Amour,
Radiator is a subtle work, held up
by powerful performances from the
minute cast.The impression it leaves
may be small, but it is certainly
lasting.
