Problematic yet representative?
Anywhere else, there would be wild uproar, but Imperial has a different demographic

n an interview on IC Radio
two weeks ago, our union
president revealed a number of
potentially problematic views.
We all say things we later go on to
regret; it’s symptomatic of the social
media age. But, our union president
chose to defend her contentious
tweets, including one which some
Imperial students might find
offensive.
In response to a question about
a tweet where she said “Scots who
voted ‘Yes’ shouldn’t be allowed
into England,” the union president
suggested that voting to “disband
the entire of Great Britain” was
“essentially” #treason.
Hashtags are often used in
jest, but by doubling down on a
regrettable error of judgement our
president trivially dismisses the
serious political desires of a subset
of Scottish students.
In case you missed it, the union
president also spoke about her
views on national politics (this was
not included in the transcript of
the interview which you will find
in this week’s FELIX). When asked
A complete

empathy
about her support for Margaret
Thatcher, “an inspirational lady
who transformed the face of
British politics,” in a tweet after
her death, she stated that “there are
a lot of families who were affected
negatively by her, my family’s wasn’t
one of them so I think it’s quite hard
to relate to that.”

proposed changes to their funding
(although they were eventually
dropped).
The sentence “I’d vote for the
Conservatives, and I’ll give a very
good reason why” isn’t normally
followed by empathetic reasoning.
The union president explained her
support for the party by saying:
“For my family, if the Conservatives
weren’t in power, they’d be severely,
severely screwed over… I feel like I
owed it to them.” To be fair to her,
she then went on to describe her
opposition to both Jeremy Hunt’s
junior doctors contract and cuts to
student bursaries.
Maybe I’m being harsh. Her
views on politics are obviously
disconnected to her role as union
president and the tweets in question
were made before she started in her
current position. However, even if
her political views don’t influence
union policy they still have to ability
to alienate parts of the student
population.
If a sabb at any other university
described Thatcher in the same
way there would be wild uproar;
however, the views of our elected
president are likely representative of
students as a whole, so I’m probably
wasting my words. Sometimes, I
wish I had gone to UCL.
Overly opinionated?
Think you can you write?
Do you love having arguments with your friends?
Do you get irrationally angry when someone is just
wrong about something?
