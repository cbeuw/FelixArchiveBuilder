S
outhampton was the lucky
destination for this term’s
IC Women’s Rugby tour,
and while the weather was
mediocre, the rest of the weekend
was far from it.
Scandalously, we were separated
on the way there, and had to go
on two different coaches, but the
reunion was oh-so-sweet. Following
an outing for beverages and much-
needed food,we headed back to base
(a luxurious scout hut) and were
given personalised tour tasks; some
were passed with flying colours over
the course of the weekend (shout-
out to Laura using an ASDA carrier
bag as a handbag on both nights),
and some monumentally failed. All
was settled at ‘Tour Court’,a solemn
judicial process in which tour
offenders were given an opportunity
to redeem themselves before Her
Honour Ran (tour secretary and
justice for the evening).
With a new sense of purpose, we

got to Oceana, where most of us
danced the night away in an evening
memorable for all, but some went
back to the hut early – purely to
better prepare for Saturday’s match.
The next day, everyone was keen,
raring to go in the unrelenting rain,

Our Mad
Max
themed
costume
game
was truly
something
to witness
L
ast Sunday saw the
Immortals’ third game
of the season, against the
Hertfordshire Hurricanes.
With both teams going into the
game with two games down, both
were hungry for their first win.
The Hurricanes, however, came out
triumphant with a score of 6-36.
Despite tough conditions both
teams came out ready to start. After
a few plays on offense, Bami Falana,
one of our starting running backs,
picked up an injury and was taken
out. We wish him a swift recovery.
Due to strong winds,pass plays were
scarce and our defense were tested
on their ability to stop run plays.
They were consistent throughout
the 1st
quarter, although the
Hurricanes scored a touchdown due
to an unsuccessful pick from Alex
Brockhurst.In the absence of Falana,
players were determined to lift up
morale, but a fumble on a pass play
was recovered by a Hertfordshire
defensive back, leading it towards
the end zone. After a miss kick and
an unsuccessful conversion, the first
quarter ended with a score of 0-13.
The 2nd
quarter started out
miserably for the offensive team:
false starts resulted in small
yardage gained, while miss-tackles
from resulted in the Hurricanes
getting back close to our end zone.
However, this was made up in the
following play with the defensive
team recovering the ball after
a forced fumble. Minor errors
within the next few offensive plays
caused significant repercussions
resulting in a QB sack and a safety.
After a successful touchdown and
conversion, the Hurricanes ended
the second quarter with the score of
0-22.
The 3rd
quarter started out strong
for the offense with running backs
Emanuel Olagbaju and Jonathan
Robert Joseph plowing through the
defensive lines. However, because of
false starts, the line of scrimmage
was forced to move backwards, and
Hertfordshire were able to score
another touchdown from a pass play
against the defense; a successful
conversion brought the score to
0-29. The next offensive plays were
abundant with Olagbaju’s ungodly
runs and trucks, but continuous
false starts continued to render
progress slow.
Womens’ Rugby leave their mark on tour
The final quarter was filled with
various fumbles and recoveries
from both sides. One in particular,
recovered by Paulius Viskis, was
very close to Hurricane’s end zone,
and set up Papa Noach for a much-
needed touchdown. Unfortunately,
the conversion was unsuccessful and
the score was 6-29, with the final
touchdown was the result of a lob
pass against the defense.
The Immortals have yet to turn
their season around. However, with
only three games played, there is
plenty of time to do it.
The Hurricanes will now host
the next game at Hertfordshire,
where the Immortals look towards
redeeming themselves and finally
turn their season around.
and you could barely keep the subs
off the pitch. We played a strong
game, with tries from Becca 1,
Becca 2, Lizzie, and Sam bringing
us to a 17-32 victory against the
Southampton medics’ team. (Freya
also brought us our first conversion
of the year, woowoo!)
Our costume game was truly
something to witness as we went
all-in for our Mad Max theme – the
picture explains all really.
Our joint social was slightly one
sided (we would have loved to have
more new dancing buddies!), but
nothing could detract from the pure
joy that was Jesters. After another
magical evening, and left only
slightly confused by the double-
toilet cubicle, we made our way
home.
Proud of all we had achieved in
the day, we were happily surprised
by how rich we all still were (why,
London, why?).
Sunday was IKEA-breakfast day
(meatballs have never looked so
good) and time for the sad trip back
home.
Roll on the next tour!
