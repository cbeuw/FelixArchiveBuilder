Imperial represents at climate march
L
ast weekend saw Imperial
students along with over
50,000 people march
through the streets of
central London to campaign for
action from governments against
climate change.
Organised by Imperial College
Environmental Society, over 40
Imperial students joined the
student bloc of the climate march
to demand that global leaders take
action to tackle the growing threat
of global warming.
Dressed in white lab coats
and handing out climate change
factsheets to members of the public,
the Imperial cohort made their way
from Park Lane down to the Houses
of Parliament. With an audio
speaker in the midst of our team,
campaign-appropriate songs were
blasted out as well as the occasional
Imperial March theme.
High profile figures such as Emma
Thompson, Charlotte Church and
Jeremy Corbyn, adressed the crowd.
The London march was the largest
of roughly 2,500 demonstrations,
which included hundreds of
thousands of protesters,taking place
around the world ahead of a crucial
UN climate summit in Paris.
Other UK cities that hosted
marches include Bristol and
Edinburgh.
In Paris, hundreds of pairs of
shoes were placed in the Place de la
Republique to replace the protesters
who could not march as a result
of the event being cancelled amid
security concerns. A human chain
was also formed by hundreds of
Parisians linking arms along the
route of the cancelled march.
The 2015 United Nations Climate
Change Conference, known as the
Conference of the Parties (COP21),
will be held in Paris from Monday
30th
November until Friday 11th
December. 147 heads of state from
around the world will converge
on the French capital to attempt
to reach a consensus on climate
change.
The 21st
session of COP21 has
seen over 190 nations gathering
in Paris, with the aim of reducing
the emission of greenhouse gases
amidst dangerous rises in global

temperatures.
Over the two weeks of the
conference, the attending parties
will discuss a potential new global
agreement on climate change.The
last time the world discussed the
possibility of a climate change deal
and came close to an agreement,
was in 2009 at the Copenhagen
summit. The campaigners who
marched hoped that there will be a
successful consensus from the talks
in Paris, with a firm agreement to
reduce the impact of human activity.
Whatever the outcome, those that
marched sent a clear signal to our
world leaders: they want a cleaner,
safer, more just future for everyone.
Over £750,000 was raised internationally
speakers from the UAE and US to
speak on the topic in SAF.
Charity Week began in the
year 2000, as a combined effort
between the University of London
Union’s ISoc network. It’s now an
international campaign, with ISocs
from the UK, the US, and Qatar,
now involved.
Over £750,000 was raised this
year in the UK, which is an increase
of 22 grand on last year’s final
figure. £435,000 of this was raised
by students at London universities.
Last year, ISoc broke their own
record by raising a mammoth
£83,401.70.
Not a charity in its own right,
Charity Week operates in
partnership with Islamic Relief.
“The members of the ISOC
have worked tremendously hard
throughout the summer and first
part of the term to make Charity
week the success that it is,” said
Jawaad Farooq, ISoc’s President.
“We’re proud and humbled that
we have this opportunity to make
a positive difference in the world
during our time at university.”
There will be a poll to determine
how the funds are spent. As well as
funding care for newborns in Gaza,
students can nominate to aid Syrian
Refugees with psychosocial support
and education, as well as other
projects in Malawi, Pakistan, India,
Myanmar and the UK.
