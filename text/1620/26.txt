CANCER
VIRGO
This week, you spend nine
hundred grand building a
recording studio. However,
it doesn’t work, and you’re
forced to soundproof the
room with old copies of
FELIX, discarded protest
signs and members of The
Techtonics.

This week, you have a
phenomenal scoop for
FELIX. Unfortunately, you
sendyourtip-offtoHangman
by mistake, meaning that one
of the horoscopes, although
unbelievable, is 100% true.
[Answers on a postcard. -
Ed]
This week you think that
[CENSORED] is a great
idea, that’ll probably help
your grades. Unfortunately,
the [CENSORED] on the
top goes wrong, leaving you
[NSFW] and humiliated.
Luckily, the next one gets
[REDACTED] at the last
minute, and you live to tell
the tale.
This week,you’re a desk in the
union. But not the famous
one, oh no. People come to
SAC to marvel at the new
desk, but no one wants a
picture of you because you
were just a flatpack from
IKEA. Out of spite, you leak
details of the new desk’s costs
to FELIX.
This week, you sneak round
Imperial collecting copies of
FELIX to make into a giant
papier mache figure of Kim
Kardashian. You place it on
a plinth on Gloucester Road.
Anne Robinson isn’t happy.
[Enough! - Ed.]
This week, you table a paper
at council to vote of no
confidenceyourself.Everyone
agrees, saying it was a long
time coming. At the last
minute,the ordinary member
filibusters your paper, and
you’re saved. You drown your
sorrows in Metric.
This week, you write arsey
comments under FELIX
articles. Congratulations!
What you don’t know, is that
the writer with the most trolls
at the end of the year wins a
prize.Take that suckers.
This week, you’re British-
born and Asian. After raising
your hand to ask a what a
word means in a lecture, your
lecturer asks the room if a
‘native speaker’ can help you
out. A German guy answers
who’s better at English than
all of us anyway.
This week, you’re the union
president. You charge a radio
show £6500 to appear for an
hour. You use the funds to
build a statue of Margaret
Thatcher in Beit. Anne
Robinson isn’t happy.
This week, you’re Jeremy
Hunt. The government
decides to send you to Syria
to fuck shit up. You agree to
go, calling it ‘a victory for
common sense’.
This week you are the Scottish
population of England who
voted ‘Yes’. After hearing that
you are not wanted here, you
all leave for Scotland. As a
result, England’s economy
crashes, Scotland collapses
due to overpopulation, and
the whole UK falls to ISIS.
Great job.
This week, you get change
from a tenner buying a
perfectly decent desk from
IKEA. Clever you.
