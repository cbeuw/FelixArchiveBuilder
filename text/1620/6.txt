COMMENT
INDCs are not a solution to climate change
We are all responsible for demanding action on climate change

O
n Monday, 25,000
official delegates
from 150 countries
descended on Paris
for the COP21 Climate Talks.
Of all the talks we have seen to
date, they are the best organised
international talks, with the most
potential. The biggest progress is
that they are focussed around the
climate action targets that countries
have agreed meet by 2020, called
Intended Nationally Determined
Contributions or INDCs. They
are also set to acknowledge at least
some of the great potential of local
and grassroots action on climate
change by emphasising the role
of individual cities, like London,
in setting their own targets and
actions.
It would be a lie,however,to herald
them as a solution,even a temporary
one, to our climate change woes.
The INDCs mentioned will allow
for more coherent discussion and
will hopefully push countries to be
more ambitious, but taken as they
are, they still steer us on a course for
at least 3°C of warming.This means
catastrophic sea level rise of at
least half a metre by 2100, massive
weather disasters, floods, droughts,
and mass homelessness. This will
largely affect those in the global
south who haven’t contributed to
climate change in the first place.
Look a little closer and it’s clear
that even this is optimistic. Huge
business groups like Business
Europe have taken the stance that
climate action is directly opposed to
economic growth and governments
are nodding along with them.
It would
be a lie
to herald
them as a
solution,
even a
temporary
one
We need
a massive
international
people’s
movement
Add your
voice and
your hand
Reluctant to set real regulation,
and scared that they’ll lose out on
industry, they have promised huge
tax funded pay-outs to companies,
should they set any.Business Europe
are right: economic growth and true
sustainability are fundamentally
incompatible and until governments
can prioritise people before profits,
economic growth will always take
precedence and climate action will
not make headway.
So, do the talks in Paris have any
relevance to the climate struggle?
They do, because they bring climate
change into the global media
spotlight, providing a stage for the
real issues to be aired among the
lies and lobbying. Globally, climate
marches of well over half a million
over the weekend highlighted the
real strength of this. These people
provide hope for real action beyond
the Paris talks, outside of the
isolated world of politicians and
corporations.
Many marchers in Britain
emphasised the link between
climate apathy and active hostility,
on the part of our government, and
their vicious and selective austerity.
Cuts to solar subsidies have cost
2000 jobs and the prospect of viable
solar energy on the grid for many
years to come, and the scrapping of
a home insulation scheme for new
houses is a huge blow to sustainable
living as heating will remain our
biggest domestic fuel use by far.
It has been estimated that a
national home insulation scheme
would create 100 thousand jobs.
Meanwhile we are the only G7
country to increase fossil fuel
subsidies – a move condemned by
the UN.
What can we do? The thing about
climate change is that it is acutely
time sensitive. As long as we emit
greenhouse gases they keep piling
up in the atmosphere and will
guarantee some degree of climate
cooking even if we halt all emissions
immediately. We need a massive
international people’s movement
that doesn’t rely on our economic
and political system to change
things, and we need it now. In fact,
we need to change them. But, time
is short and we must take every
opportunity to force the powers
that be to listen now, whether that
be rallying in huge numbers in every
country on the 12th
of December
to mark the end of the climate
talks, taking part in mass civil
disobedience through the climate
games, or playing a part in any of
countless climate change actions
organised by ordinary people like us
in the months following the talks.
So don’t be disheartened by the
failure, on the surface, of the Paris
talks to deliver a safe future, instead
add your voice and your hand to the
growing number demanding action
on climate change for our own sake
and that of our fellow humans.
