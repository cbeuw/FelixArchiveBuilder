Just gals being pals: a history of lesbian films
Following the release of Carol, Todd Haynes’ latest masterwork, we look back
through cinema’s greatest sapphic power couples, from Mädchen in Uniform to Blue
is the Warmest Colour
Manuela and
Fräulein von
Bernburg in
Mädchen in
Uniform (1931)
One of the first lesbian films
to be produced, the Weimar film
Mädchen in Uniform has set up
many of the classic tropes of lesbian
cinema: schoolgirls infatuated with
older women; teasing flirtation
spilling over into something more;
unhappy endings. Based in a
girls’ boarding school, Mädchen in
Uniform tells the story of Manuela,
a young girl whose mother has died,
and has been placed into the strict
school. She immediately becomes
infatuated with a kindly teacher,
Fräulein von Bernburg, who returns
her affections immediately. Banned

Martha and
Karen in The
Children’s Hour
(1961)
Shirley MacLaine and Audrey
Hepburn play two friends who
open a private all-girls school.
After one girl is punished, she
starts a malicious rumour that
the two headmistresses are in a
secret relationship – a shocking
revelation in the 1960s. Although
their relationship is never actually
consummated, MacLaine’s Martha
does express feelings for Hepburn’s
Karen; in a masterful turn from
MacLaine (who acts Hepburn
Thelma and
Louise in
Thelma and
Louise (1991)
The classic gal-pal film, Thelma
and Louise has become a buzzword
for female empowerment, and the
lasting bond that is created between
two women when one of them
kills a rapist. Geena Davis and
Susan Sarandon are Thelma and
Louise, two old friends on the run
from the long arm of the law. An
overwhelming success when it was
released, Thelma and Louise has gone
down in history as a cult classic of
American cinema, and rightly so.
Cay and Vivian
in Desert Hearts
(1985)
One of the first films where a
lesbian relationship was depicted
favourably, Desert Hearts follows
the journey of Vivian Bell (Helen
Shaver), a professor approaching
middle age, who travels to Nevada
in order to obtain a quickie divorce
from her husband. While staying
at a ranch, she is surprised by her
feelings for free-spirit Cay Rivvers
(Patricia Charbonneau); these
feelings are reciprocated, and the

‘decadent’ content, many of the
stars – who were Jewish – did not
manage to escape the death camps.

outpours all her emotions. ‘I feel so
damned sick and dirty I can’t stand
it anymore,’ she cries, before – in
true ‘Lesbians-Can’t-Have-Nice-
Things’ style – hanging herself in
her room.
two enter into a steamy relationship.
The ending leaves things open for
a bright future, although it’s not
explicitly stated.
Radha and Sita
in Fire (1996)
The first part of Indo-Canadian
director Deepa Mehta’s legendary
Elements trilogy, Fire tells of the
relationship that develops between
newly-married Sita (Nandita Das)
and her older sister-in-law Radha
(Shabana Azmi). Both women are
isolated, cut off from any passion by
their neglectful husbands, and find
solace in each other.The unflinching
depiction of homosexuality seen
in the film sparked protests across
India, leading to debates about
freedom of speech, the role of
religion in society, and the social
fabric of the country. If nothing
else, that would be the mark of
a groundbreaking film, but Fire
goes beyond this, with nuanced
performances from the central cast
making Radha and Sita a couple
burning with desire.
Agnes and Elin
in Fucking Åmål
(1998)
The directorial breakthrough of
Swedish director Lukas Moodysson,
Fucking Åmål follows two teenage
girls living in backwater Sweden
who develop a relationship. Agnes
(Rebecka Liljeberg) is a depressed
loner, with few true friends; Elin
(Alexandra Dahlström) is more
Betty and Rita
in Mulholland
Drive (2001)
I mean, does anyone really
understand what this film is about?
Widely considered the masterwork
of American auteur David Lynch
– commonly regarded as one of the
greatest directors working today –
Nic and Jules in
The Kids are All
Right (2010)
Nominated for the Best Picture
Academy Award in 2010, Lisa
Cholodenko’s The Kids are All Right
is unusual in some ways, in that it
shows a lesbian couple who have
been together for years, rather than
depicting the start of a relationship.
Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic
(Annette Bening) are married with
two children, living in LA. But
when their children track down
their sperm donor father, Paul
(Mark Ruffalo), strains are put
on their relationship, and hidden
tensions begin to emerge. With
excellent performances from the
whole cast, The Kids are All Right is
a warm, witty gem of a drama film.
And if that’s not enough to tempt
you, there’s a scene where Nic sings
Joni Mitchell’s ‘All I Want’ – what
more could you need in a film?
Emma and
Adèle in Blue
is the Warmest
Colour (2013)
Bursting onto our screens in 2013,
Blue is the Warmest Colour,Abdellatif
Kechiche’s 5th
film, made history
when lead actors Léa Seydoux and
Adèle Exarchopoulos were awarded
the Palme d’Or along with Kechiche
at the 66th
Cannes Film Festival,
for their performances as Emma
and Adèle respectively. Based on
the graphic novel by Julie Maroh,
the film garnered widespread
Evelyn and
Cynthia in
The Duke of
Burgundy
(2014)
It’s rare to find a film that
combines lesbian relationships,
BDSM, and research into moths,
but Peter Strickland’s third feature
film The Duke of Burgundy manages
to do just that. Following on from
his masterful Berbarian Sound
Studio (2012), based on Italian
giallo films, Strickland took his
cues from 1970s eurotrash erotica
for this exploration of relationships.
Sidse Babett Knudsen (of Borgen
fame) plays Cynthia,the older,more
dominant one of the relationship,
while Chiara D’Anna is Evelyn,
the young ingénue. However,
things aren’t as they seem, and the
film undermines the traditional
narrative, and takes things into
more philosophical territory. With
sumptuous visuals, brilliant acting,
and a cracking score from Cat’s
Eyes, this is a must-watch.

outgoing, but full of ennui, and
unsatisfied with life. The two come
together after Agnes’ 16th
birthday
party, a horrifically embarrassing
experience for shy Agnes; they
believe the key to living a good life
would be leaving their small town of
Åmål and making it to Stockholm
– the town of Åmål took offence
to this portrayal, and in English
the film is called Show Me Love. A
tender portrayal of the turbulence of
teenage sexuality, Fucking Åmål is a
must-watch.
this film is completely batshit crazy.
A brunette woman escapes from a
car crash, making her way to safety
in a house in LA; suffering from
amnesia she takes on the name of
Rita,and surprises Betty,whose aunt
owns the house. As Betty tries to
help Rita remember what happened
to her, the bonds between the two
women strengthens, leading to
consummation of the relationship,
and a visit to the mysterious Club
Silencio. Way more stuff happens,
and I would need to see it at least
seven more times to properly
understand what’s going on. All
I know is that the film is visually
arresting, poignantly scripted, and
boasts career-best performances
from Naomi Watts and Laura
Harring.

controversy due to its explicit nature,
and lengthy sex scenes. However,
look past such aspects, and you will
find that Blue is the Warmest Colour
is a film shot through with pathos,
intimacy, and humanity. Following
the couple over a number of years,
from the development of the
relationship,to them living together,
and its eventual implosion, Blue is
the Warmest Colour is one of the most
impressive love stories to be put to
film in recent years, thanks largely
to the incredible performances from
Exarchopoulos and Seydoux.
