eing new to London, I
have been trying to work
my way round as many
galleries and exhibitions
as possible. Unfortunately, work has
been getting in the way somewhat,
so it was exciting to trundle off to
the Tate (via being a photo-taking
tourist on the Millenium Bridge)
to have a look at one of their
latest exhibitions – a collection of
sculptures by Alexander Calder.
As soon as I walked into the
gallery I knew I was onto a winner.
The first room had just three
simple hanging wire sculptures,
but I was mesmerised. Like a 3D
sketch, Calder had deftly captured
the features of a woman in a piece
entitled ‘Medusa’ in just a few
twists of wire, which cast wonderful
shadows,and was equally interesting
from a number of angles.
In the next, much larger, room,
more of these simple 3D sketches
were on display, this time mainly
inspired by circus figures. Standing
pondering the simplicity of the
works I was struck by how they
reminded me of drawings produced
when you aren’t allowed to take the
pencil off the page. Strongmen,
acrobats,dancers and elephants were
all vividly captures in his sculptures,
some of which were hanging from
of a painted board backdrop with
bigger, blocky hanging sculptures
in front of them, where the shadow
from the hanging aspect became
part of the 2D background.
As you might have guessed from
my descriptions, the majority of
the rooms cast light on Calder’s
less known work, but the final two
the ceiling and gently twisting, and
all carefully lit so that their shadows
were projected behind them.
The interplay between Calder’s
3D works and their 2D shadows
was fascinating,and something I am
sure that both the Tate and Calder
were keen to emphasise. One room
focused on works which consisted
rooms were full of his iconic organic
mobiles – perfectly balanced
hanging sculptures which gently
twisted and transformed themselves
in the ambient breeze. Here again
the interplay between the sculptures
and their shadows was mesmerising,
especially as they gently twisted and
changed. It was incredibly relaxing
just to sit and watch. They ought to
get some for Central Library.
Whilst I very much enjoyed the
exhibition, at £18 a go (luckily not
if you are reviewing for FELIX!)
this is certainly a gallery to persuade
your parents to take you to. The
artworks are wonderful – but the
price seems extortionate.
Time waits for no comic

A
stand up comedian’s
worst nightmare:
arriving late to your own
show. A stage managers
worst nightmare: having to run
the show and entertain a room full
of punters whilst waiting for the
act to arrive. This is exactly what
unfolds before us in the original
meta-comedy ‘Waiting for Gaddot’,
running at the Invisible Dot.
The following 60 minutes is
an erratic farce that unravels
unashamedly in front of the
audience. For the most part,
the experience is immersive and
entertaining. The play intersperses
‘live action’ with flashback videos;
these are well made and contribute
to the narrative, although disrupt
the flow a little too much and fail
to keep the audience as captivated
as they were in the first five minutes.
Often making mockery out of
and at times transparent. With
this said, they can be thoroughly
redeemed as they transmit such
a positive spirit to the audience,
making you want to support every
joke they attempt, no matter how
silly or obtuse. The venue itself, the
Invisible Dot, supports this vibe
fittingly – its intimacy, informality
and pub-like atmosphere contribute
just as much to the experience as
anything else.
Overall, ‘Waiting for Gaddot’
is original, unusual and amusing
throughout. Whilst some elements
are slightly off and executed poorly,
the well spirited cast never fail to
keep the audience on edge and most
importantly, laughing.

Immersive and

pop culture and modern day norms,
the humour used throughout is
fairly amusing. However, the gags
aren’t anywhere near as original as
the shows format would initially
suggest and they are derivative and
expected most of the time.
It is apparent throughout that the
cast are mainly stand-up comics, for
their acting is often over-cooked
Pirelli is a poacher turned gamekeeper

F
irst they came for Playboy,
now Pirelli; this is turning
out to be quite a winter of
discontent for the world’s
meninists. Earlier this week, Pirelli,
the luxury tyre company that
produces one of the fashion and art
world’s most exclusive calendars,
caused quite a stir when they
announced the 2016 editon would
feature women more known for
their brains and their brawn than
their bodies.
In Pirelli’s 52 year history, their
calendars have almost exclusively
featured scantily clad supermodels,
Kate Moss, Christy Turlington in
the 90s and Adriana Lima and Lara
Stone more recently.
The soft core pin-up images have
been lent artistic credence by the
photographers who have worked on
the issues.The distinguished roll call
includes Helmut Newton and Steve
McCurry to name a few.
2016 will be Annie Liebovitz’s
second edition with the company. It
marks an about turn in the calendar’s
usual subject matter.
It is accomplishment, not flesh on
show (for the most part). Instead of
supermodels, it’s superwomen who
are featured.Patti Smith,Yoko Ono,
Serena Williams and Ava duVernay
make up a roster of women of
different ages, sizes and ethnicities
who are pictured in next year’s
edition. Most are fully clothed.
That this is publicity stunt
designed to maximise on the current
climate of celebrity endorsed social
justice there can be no doubt,
however, does this signal a turning
point in the fashion industry’s
attitude towards women and how it
displays their bodies?
The Pirelli calendar website
certainly proclaims it does.
Somewhat grandiosely it declares
that the calendar has been ‘a journey
through the evolution of taste,
society and the customs of the last
60 years’
Perhaps. The Pirelli calendar
is famous for never going on
sale, it is instead sent out to an
exclusive and secret list of 20,000
‘VIPs’: musicians, politicians and
royalty’ according to a company
spokesperson.
The shift towards showing
powerful women, fully clothed
and presented as peers and equals
rather than women displayed as
objects of desire for the male gaze
shows a shift in the clientele Pirelli
is hoping to woo. Amongst the
secret list of powerful people, more
are now likely to be women, women
who who would rather an image of
Fran Lebowitz hung on their walls
for a month than Gigi Hadid in a
moulded latex bodysuit (featured in
last year’s calendar).
So what of the artistic merits of
Leibovitz’s offering? Ironically, it
is the image of Serena Williams,
one of two women in the calendar
not fully clothed, that is the most
visually striking.
The living tennis legend is
pictured with her back to the
viewer, muscles rippling. The pose
brings to mind classical statues of
sporting heroes and demi-gods, of
Amazonian warrior women. The
delineation of light and shade, the
strong profile of her face speaks of
power, of legend. It is a beautiful
image but it is fearsome at the same
time, it commands respect. The
beauty in Leibovitz’s images are not
manufactured male fantasies, but a
very specific beauty to each sitter.
The focus in Amy Schumer’s
portraitisonhersardonicexpression,
not on her body, though she is the
othe rowman who appears (almost)
in the nude - the joke being that she
is the only one who didn’t get the
memo. Patti Smith, insouciant in a
white shirt and black trousers seems
to be lit almost with a halo.
Above all, the portraits demand
that the women be seen as
individuals before they are seen as
subjects. It is tragic that so simple
a thing is seen as groundshaking,
but it is on the foundation of these
small victories that cultural shifts
take place.
Gimmick or not, it is heartening
that Pirelli has changed at all. It will
be hard for them to go back to the
stutus quo, a return to bums and
boobs next year is guaranteed to be
PR suicide.
Here’s hoping they have begun as
they mean to continue; it would be
great to see more inclusion in the
future; perhaps 2017 will feature
Laverne Cox as Miss July or Ruth
Bader Ginsburg as Miss May. A girl
can dream!
