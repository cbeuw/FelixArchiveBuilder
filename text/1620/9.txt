Your union president speaks!
Your very own union president, Lucinda Sandon-Allum, was a guest on IC radio a
while back. Here’s what went down.
I
C Radio: On a scale of
Abraham Lincoln to Donald
Trump, how would you rate
your ability as President?
Lucinda: Probably more towards
Abraham Lincoln. If Trump was 1
and Lincoln 10, 6.5.
IC Radio: So if you were
president of the world you wouldn’t
be launching nuclear attacks on
everyone?
L: Oh, no.
IC Radio: That’s good to hear.
This was a user submitted question:
what’s your go to meal to cook at
home?
L: Um, sticky Lime and Ginger
Chicken.
IC Radio: This is user submitted
so don’t judge us. If you could keep
one of music or sex, which would
you keep?
L: Sex, sorry Mum.
IC Radio: What’s your go-to
selfie face?
L: I don’t take selfies. I always
smile though, I can’t take pictures
without smiles.
IC Radio: One horse sized duck,
or 100 duck sized horses?
L: 100 duck sized horses. I think
having a load of little ducks running
around would be really cute.
IC Radio: How much work does
Imperial have to do to improve
Gender Equality? The Physics
department forwarded an email to
the year which encouraged students
to attend a freshers lunch in order
to stake a claim on one in five girls.
That example was included on a
book about sexism in Universities.
L: It varies. Obviously in the
sporting world there’s a lot more
work to do, for example the events
at varsity last year as well. In general
terms, not that much, but I think
more respect needs to be shown
towards women, especially if you
step forward and put yourself in
the limelight, I’ve experienced that
myself.
It depends what sector you look
at, but it definitely is getting there.
ICRadio:Is there an undercurrent
of tolerance, even encouragement,
of sexist, misogynistic behaviour in
Impeiral Sports clubs and can you
do anything to change that? Last
year, a Sport Imperial employee
at the Varsity spoke on the Rugby
Girls saying,“I don’t care how those
fat girls get home”. Do you agree
that there is an undercurrent of
sexism in sport at Imperial?
L: I think there is, but I think the
issue comes with group mentality
and drinking. I think if we’re
going to use boys as an example
within their teams, then I know a
lot of guys who play sport and are
very nice people, but the minute
you put them together in a group
mentality and drinking… I think it
also extends, because they’re quite
traditional societies; it extends
from back in the day when sexism
was ok. Horrible as it sounds, and I
hate saying that, but it was. Now it’s
being clamped down on, but I think
it still extends from that, it’s a group
mentality.
IC Radio: Is that an excuse?
L: It’s not an excuse, but it’s
something that will take a while to
work on.
IC Radio: Is there anything you
can do about it?
L: We can. At the beginning of
our club officer training we showed
inequality videos. There are steps
that we can take to try and ensure
things are better.
IC Radio: Last year there was
a rugby scandal. For those of you
that don’t know, basically there was
a game where the rugby players on
the way home from training had to
get off the tube, strip off as much as
possible, and then get back on the
tube – a drinking game.
The way the president at the
time, Tom Wheeler, dealt with this
was sanctions. But there was a big
backlash from doing that, a lot of
criticism over him doing that.I want
to ask you: do you agree with what
he did, or do you think he deserves
the criticism he receives and would
you do anything differently if that
happened this year?
L: I think he handled it amazingly
well. I think the way that he did
it... obviously as the union we are
there to protect the students from
everything. We’re there to make
sure the media don’t get hold of it,
the police don’t get hold of anything,
that every single student is fine with
their future lives and all that sort of
thing; that there’s nothing on the
record.
He dealt with it very well because
it stayed internally. Yes, he might
have got a backlash but it stayed
internal and there was nothing that
went out. I think he dealt with it
very well in that respect. You have
to discipline people to make them
understand that it’s not ok, but they
didn’t come out of it badly.
IC Radio: Some people say that
sabb positions, like the one you’ve
got, like the one Grace Rahman, the
FELIX Editor has got, are only run
for people that have got careerist
ambitions, people looking to put
something on their CV. Are you a
careerist?
L: I think everyone at Imperial
is, but that isn’t the reason why I
ran. I ran because I have been quite
heavily involved in different areas
of the Union in my time here. I
really enjoy doing this sort of stuff. I
wouldn’t have run or put the amount
of effort I did when I was running
if I wanted it for a career reason.
I could have spent my summers,
instead of doing things for RCSU,
doing internships, but I didn’t. I
really enjoy helping students out, I
know it sounds very clichéd because
the president is saying that, but
I genuinely do. When students
come up to me and says: “You’ve
made quite a big difference with
this, thank you for your help”, I feel
really good about myself. So I didn’t
do it for that reason, I did it because
I really wanted to help, but I think
everyone at Imperial looks after
their careers as well.
IC Radio: Do you have any
particular advice for someone that’s
running for a sabb position?
L: I would say, think carefully
about the position you want to run
for.If you’re deciding between a few,
think about the experiences that
you have behind those,as they differ
a lot. Ask the current sabbs, that’s
the best way to find information.
Try really hard to put something
together that’s really unique and
innovative, as you don’t want to be
making the same promises as last
year.
IC Radio: When you ran for
Union President, you ran as a
woman running in a STEM subject
only university where 69% of the
students are men. Did you ever
suffer any sexist abuse? How did
that make you feel, what was your
response? Do you think you need a
tough skin to be a sabb officer?
L: Yes I did [suffer sexist abuse].
At first it made me feel really
terrible, it really, really did, but
then I had a lot of people saying,
just ignore it, that is what is going
to happen. I spoke to a few female
old sabbs or people who ran for
sabb positions before I did, and they
said, “as a word of warning, people
aren’t going to judge you on you
manifesto points, they are going to
judge you on how you look and how
you present yourself because you’re
female.” So I had that instinctive,
you know, this is going to happen
to me. So at first I did feel rubbish,
but my friends and campaign team
reminded me [that this would
happen]. You do have to have very
thick skin I think. People are going
to hold you accountable for a lot of
things, people are going to lay into
you about some things that they are
not happy with. There is a lot, and
I know people talk about you a lot
as well. You obviously hope people
try and talk about you in a good
light, but sometimes it’s not. I know
sometimes a lot of people vent their
anger and say things like, ‘Oh the
sabbs have done this and the sabbs
have done that’, so yes, you do
have to have thick skin, and that’s
something I now have got. I didn’t
have a thick skin as such before I
ran I think, but now I really do. I’m
not phased by much.
IC Radio: So you expected the
vitriol and the abuse directed at
you, maybe partly because you are
a woman as this male dominated
university? And if so,did it still hurt,
did it still affect you even though
you knew it was coming?
L: Yeah.That’s a hard one because
it did hurt even though I knew
it was coming, so I don’t think
anything can prepare you. You can
be warned about anything but then
until it happens, you’ll say “Oh
gosh, this has actually happened to
me, people weren’t lying or trying to
psych me out.”Yeah, it did hurt, but
like I said, I had the most incredible
support and they said, “don’t even
think about it, forget it, you’re the
one who has put yourself forward,
you’re the one that wants to do this,
you’re the one who wants to change
student experience and that sort
of thing, so go for it, don’t think
about it.” Actually I had a lot of my
friends who stopped it as well. If
they heard anything, they’d say “no,
that isn’t the case”, and I had a huge
contingent of male campaigners, so
that counteracted it really, because I
thought, actually, people might just
be saying this because they want to
vent about something or other.
IC Radio:
This is one of my favourite tweets,
possibly of all time.
“The Scots who voted yes shouldn’t
be allowed into England. You don’t
like us, well news flash, we really
don’t like you either #Treason”. Do
you still stand by that statement?”
L: Partly. I think I wrote that
when I was very angry because I’m,
as you can probably tell, extremely
patriotic. I love Great Britain; I love
Great Britain as England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Anything to do with Britain I will
love. I think it was more a case that
I felt like: “Why would you vote to
leave the body that is together, that
is supporting each other?” I just
can’t get my head around that. I
still can’t. I think that was a little bit
harsh, it was very in-the-spur of the
moment. I knew this would come
up at some point! I remember one
of my friends saying “You should
delete that” and I said “No, I’m
going to stick by this”.
So no, I stick by it. Obviously I’ve
got a lot of Scottish friends, but
thankfully all of them voted to stay
within the Union. I just felt it was
“England, Scotland, who supports
who? Who does this, who does
that?”I want it to be a unity.Anyone
saying ‘no’, I feel that’s a bit of a two
fingers up to everyone else. I think
that upset me at a deeper level. I
know that’s very controversial, I
don’t think anyone knows about
that tweet actually.
IC Radio: But is it treason
though?
L: Hmm, this is my traditional
side coming out. I don’t know, I
think treason is a very strong word,
but, in a sense, if you’re voting to
disband the entire of Great Britain
essentially.
IC Radio: You mentioned you
have to represent the views of the
students, but at the same time you
have to be apolitical, because you
have to represent all of them, and
there’s a massive mix of student
views.
Again, I’ll start with Twitter:
“Tube drivers! You are not entitled
to massive salaries. Get over it!” via
the Telegraph.
Are junior doctors allowed
massive salaries? Do their salaries
qualify as massive given their job?
Do you support Jeremy Hunt in his
bid to cut them?
L: I definitely do not support
Jeremy Hunt, at all. I don’t know
who would! I’m sorry if you do!
In relation to the tube drivers and
the junior doctors, the amount of
qualifications junior doctors have to
go through, the work that they have
to put in, everything that they have
to go through to become a doctor.
Obviously that’s the school, further
education, higher education, the
money you have to spend, especially
now with £9000 fees. Everything
that goes into becoming a doctor,
you have to live, breath, eat, and
speak medicine, everything!
With tube drivers, no they are not
entitled to massive salaries! Their
salaries already are huge, for the fact
they press a button, and they drive
a train. I think every job [salary]
should be in relation to how much
effort, how much training has been
put into it. I know a lot of people
will be like: “What,as if tube drivers
can’t become doctors?”, that sort of
thing. I completely appreciate and
respect that, but there are a lot of
people in this university who have
come from extremely disadvantaged
backgrounds, who have worked
extremely hard and are on their way
to becoming a doctor.
So in respect to training, hours
and effort, doctors should get paid
more.
IC Radio: Do you support
that move by the current Tory
government to remove maintenance
grants?
L: Not at all. I think the problem
is that, yes you might be getting the
same amount of money technically,
or more, but the student debt thing
comes into account, and actually it
will put off a lot of people coming to
University, if they think that they’ll
be in even more debt and I already
can’t afford to come to university.
It’ll put so many people off, and
from disadvantaged backgrounds as
well, and they’re the people who we
need. Especially in STEM subjects.
I think that at Imperial, being the
only specialist STEM institution
in the country, it’s already difficult
to get people in who haven’t come
from independent schools, because
independent schools have all the
equipment necessary to teach
science at a high level. The problem
is that if we’re just going to take away
the money we can give to students
without them having to pay it back,
people are going to be so daunted by
the prospect of coming to university,
especially London. That’s the issue.
People will think, “Oh, I’m going
to come out with loads of debt that
I’ll have to pay off.” People will
end up doing apprenticeships, and
they’re good as well if you want to
do that, but obviously coming from
a University point of view,I feel that
everyone, if they want to, should be
able to come to University. I think
that would be such a shame if that
was not an option for people.
