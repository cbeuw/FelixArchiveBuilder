ave you ever wanted to
listen to an interesting
lecture in the antique
Sheldonian Theatre
of Oxford or walk around in a
crowded, loud Ashmolean Museum
holding a champagne glass in your
hand? Imagine participating in
such events whilst discussing and
proposing new solutions to the
international issues humanity faces
today. This was only a part of what
ICMUN did in the past week.
These past two weekends,
ICMUN has participated in two
very renowned MUN conferences:
Oxford International Model
United Nations (OxIMUN) and
Cambridge University International
ModelUnitedNations(CUIMUN).
In case you’re confused, Model
United Nations is a forum, within
which delegates represent a country
in the United Nations committee.
Delegates work together to address
various international issues. Over
two events, our members were able
to agree on responses to the Syrian
refugee crisis, flight path safety
assessment (after the crash of the
Russian airplane in Egypt), and
many more contemporary issues.
This year ICMUN was able to
send its highest ever number of
Chairs to lead the debates at the
conferences. Our Chairs Enric
Alcoser, Milia Hasbani, Justus
Löbler, Lalit Maganti, Ahmed Raja,
and Dijana Spasenoska were able
to ensure committees ran smoothly
for both weekends.Furthermore,we
could not be prouder of our ICMUN
delegation, who persevered in the
face of headstrong delegates, harsh
weather conditions, and multiple
late nights of MUN parties. Such
determination enabled our very own
two members Ilaria Coppola and
Chris Whitehouse to travel back
home with a Best Delegate Award
and a Diplomacy Award.
Of course, it wasn’t all business.
Dining in some of the most
prestigious colleges of Oxford and
Cambridge, dancing to Hotline
Bling and enjoying exclusive
club nights in both Oxford and
Cambridge were only some of the
highlights of our trips.
If you are interested in the United
Nations and how it works, feel free
to come along to one of our sessions.
These are held on Thursdays from
18:00 – 20:00 in Skempton 307. No
prior MUN experience is required.

leaders in politics, business or any

t’s always a good sign when
you look back on your week
and realise that you definitely
spent more hours in rehearsals
than on your degree. We’re at
Imperial. My course averages 7
hours of contact time most days.
So, that’s not exactly a meaningless
statement. But, that’s just the world
of theatre.
At the beginning of term,
and having taken a year out, I
was altogether too enthusiastic
about returning to my studies.
I auditioned for pretty much
everything going. This meant that
I ended up conning my way into
the cast for both Musical Theatre’s
‘Revue: Live in Living Colour’ and
DramSoc’s ‘Neverwhere’, which
conveniently have their show weeks
one after the other.
In all four years that I’ve been
here, I have never had so much fun
or so little sleep. The talent of every
single person I’ve worked with so far
is truly incredible,and I’m so excited
for both of the shows.
Of course, I don’t actually get to
watch the shows when I’m singing,
dancing, acting or some terrible
combination of the three. So it’s
down to you to come and tell
me if they’re any good. From my
end they’re looking pretty snazzy,
though.They should do,too,because
I’m pretty sure some of our directors
haven’t been to sleep in a fortnight.
We’ve bounced from run-throughs
to rehearsal, to tech-runs and dress
rehearsals, and occasionally to
Primark and Poundland to pick up
various bits of costume at the last
minute.
If you have the chance to audition,
do it! Just, maybe don’t audition for
everything, if you actually want to
pass your degree this year.

I
t’s obvious when you think
about it, but still slightly odd:
more than half of people
involved in theatre never
make it on stage. A further four
people are on stage, but exclusively
when the lights are off. In almost
every play, actors are truly the tip of
the iceberg. Most people know very
little about backstage work (which
is, perhaps, the point), but after
working in it things become a little
clearer.
I’m involved with stage
management, the people in black
who move things around on stage.
Their work kicks off with the
creation of “the book”, which is
to the stage manager as the Bible
is to God. It’s a copy of the script,
but with absolutely everything you
need to know to put on a play: the
timing for lights and sound, where
the actors will be, what the stage
hands will be doing, and literally
everything else.
The book is then given to the
deputy stage manager, who sits
in a perch overlooking the stage.
They instruct lighting, sound and
set over radio. At first, this was a
nerve-racking experience for me.
A wrongly placed cue can really
disrupt a play. Once, I asked for
a phone noise and instead got
a clip from the Backstreet Boys.
Fortunately, the nerves quickly give
way to a sense of megalomania.
Looking down on a play and
having light, sound and people co-
ordinating to your voice can really
be a thrill.
Then you have the stage hands.
This is a great way to get involved
without committing too much time,
and to see if you’d like to do more
in future.
And if you don’t want the pressure
of being there when the play is on,
there’s still plenty to do.
Possibly the most labour intensive
part of production is making the set,
which is ideally done before the play
starts showing. This is more time
consuming than you would believe,
so DramSoc often finishes about
half an hour before the curtains
open, but we go with what works.
The job normally involves sawing,
glueing and nailing, to the point
where DramSoc has a workshop
directly under the stage.
There’s also costume design
and creation. We have a small but
skilled group who make costumes
from scratch, but complicated or
important costumes are normally
rented from the National Theatre.
Just visiting their storeroom is
an experience – there are literally
thousands of costumes, ordered by
Neverwhere crew: what do they do?

etting lost on the way to
an audition and turning
up half an hour late
is never the best way
to make a first impression. Even
for the loudest, bubbliest, most
shameless person, the audition
process is daunting. When you
factor in poor punctuality, relatively
little acting experience and the
general dazed bewilderment of a
fresher, you can’t expect to get very
far. And yet, for some reason it was
decided that I was suitable for the
role of a vile, ruthless, deranged
killer. Out of context, this may not
seem very pleasant, but I couldn’t
feel luckier. Having the chance to
perform again has been amazing,
and in my excitement I devoured
the script as soon as I got a copy –
which did happen to be very late at
night (or very early in the morning,
however you want to look at it), and
before a 9am. It was worth it.
Neil Gaiman’s ‘Neverwhere’ has
a variety of outlandish characters,
and seeing them brought to life
during rehearsal has been incredibly
interesting. As someone who has
not acted in two years, it’s been
refreshing to start over, seeing how
other people take to characters
and how our director (Helen
Root) interprets them. The dark
nature of the play has lent itself to
an exploration of different acting
techniques – things that I certainly
have never tried before. A highlight
was the stage combat workshop. I
have never been part of a fight scene
before, and learning how to kick,
punch and otherwise attack a fellow
actor was exhilarating. For those
wondering, this doesn’t mean that
DramSoc members know how to
beat people up. As one of the stage
combat tutors said, if he got into a
real fight, at best he could throw a
fake punch and confuse the assailant
for long enough to run away.
Gaiman is known for writing dark,
bizarre stories – but all of them,
Neverwhere included, contain a
touch of humour. The character’s
personalities are therefore brilliant
to play with. Whether the laughter
comes from being utterly grotesque,
sarcastic, scathing, or just really,
really pathetic, it’s always satisfying
when the comic timing is right on
point.
As for rehearsals, they are some
of the most fun I have had since
starting at Imperial. After a stressful
series of lectures, or a lab where
nothing seems to go right, nothing

The Neverwhere cast speak
cheers me up like a rehearsal. I’ve
met some lovely people and made
great friends.
If you haven’t seen the teaser
trailer for Neverwhere, check it
out. It’s downright badass – and
it took a day of makeup, shooting
and recording to put together. As
someone who was a part of it, it was
really exciting to get into costume
for the first time, though it made
the show seem a lot more real and a
lot closer, which did make me panic
a little. It’s been a real challenge to
balance line learning and rehearsal
with starting a degree, and has also
shown me just how little sleep I
need if I have coffee.Saying this,I’ve
loved being a part of ‘Neverwhere’,
and all I can say now is bring on
show week.
era.
The final touch on a costume is
stage makeup. Lights on stage are
famously harsh, so actors all have a
thick layer of foundation, eyeliner
and lots of contouring. It’s a great
way to release your inner Kim K.
Working backstage is stressful,
difficult, but ultimately great fun.
It’s a weird perk that each play has

Neverwhere has “Beast Creator”
and a stop-motion artist in its crew.
DramSoc always needs more help,
so if any of the above sounds like
fun, please get involved – email

We are still looking for stage
hands for Neverwhere or any of the
above roles for shows next term.
