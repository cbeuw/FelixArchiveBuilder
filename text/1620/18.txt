T
he verb ‘to ravish’has two
meanings.In one context,
we can use it to describe
being transported to a
place of ecstasy, where our emotions
take flight, and we are overcome
with an inescapable delight,
swirling upwards to a higher plane.
In another, it describes something
far more brutal: to take by force,
to seize and carry someone off,
kicking and screaming, against their
will. In both senses of the word,
exploring this freakish dichotomy,
Carol is utterly, irresistibly, achingly
ravishing.
Based on Patricia Highsmith’s
convention-busting 1952 novel
The Price of Salt, Carol is at its
core a love story. Therese Belivet
(Rooney Mara) is a young shop-
girl who is unable to reciprocate
her boyfriend’s feelings for her, and
has a vague dream of becoming a
photographer. Carol Aird (Cate
Blanchett) approaches, following
some meaningful eye-contact across
a crowded shop floor, to ask for
help buying a Christmas present
for her daughter Rindy. Making her
first move, Carol leaves her gloves
behind on the counter, relying on
Therese to pick up on the flirtatious
undertones in their conversations;
returning the gloves leads to a lunch,
and then to home visits, and finally
a trip out west. It is this sojourn that
allows Therese to distract herself
from her boyfriend Richard (Jake
Lacy), Carol to forget about the
impending divorce from husband
Harge (Kyle Chandler), and the
two lovers to establish their physical
relationship. Moving around each
other in a carefully choreographed
dance of a love that must remain
hidden, things eventually – as they
inevitably must – come crashing
down: Carol returns to New
York to fight for custody of her
daughter, and Therese’s anguish at
the abandonment takes on a brute
physical force, as she violently
vomits up her emotions on a
highway returning east.
What was radical about the novel
– and, indeed, remains radical over
half a century of progress later – is
the possibility of a happy ending
that opens up for the couple. It is
one that is not explicitly stated by
director Todd Haynes, who deals
in subtle clues rather than dramatic
outbursts: the hand lingering just
a little too long on the shoulder;
the gaze that is caught and held;
the meaningful pause. Haynes is
clearly in his element with Carol,
which – after 2002’s Far From
Heaven – cements his place as a key
interpreter of 20th
century America.
Haynes’ camera almost always
views Carol and Therese obliquely:
through doorways, marking off the
boundaries of private and public;
within cars, ensconcing them in
their own bubble of chrome and
upholstery; through windows,
their faces smudged into blurs by
greasy smears. Trapped within their
passion, the pair place a buttress
between themselves and the world,
retreating into their own private
domain – a necessary technique for
coping with the social pressures of
the day, but also a perfect portrayal
of the all-consuming passion love
can bring.
The dialogue is poignant, with
every pause and ellipse pregnant
with unfulfilled longing. Phyllis
Nagy’s screenplay brings with it
a soft sense of a beat, offset by the
visual melody provided by Edward
Lachman’s cinematography. Carter
Burwell’s score, all swelling strings
and plucked harp, contributes to
this harmony, although on occasion
it does outstay its welcome. Carol
is simply stunning. Sandy Powell’s
sumptuous costume design alone
conjuresuptheideaofamid-century
Manhattan, but Jesse Rosenthal’s
pitch-perfect art direction takes
this to new heights. The audience
is transported out of the cinema,
and stand blinking, blinded by the
midwinter sun, and the possibilities
of love it can bring.
As Therese, Mara is at a career-
best; in her hands, we watch Therese
mature within the course of several
months,from a naïve young girl,one
who agrees without knowing what
she wants,to a fully-fledged woman.
Her sexual awakening creates a fire
within Therese, one that burns off
any soft corners,leaving behind hard
edges; her warm dimples traded
for an angular jawline; hairbands
exchanged for high heels.

Carol is a
depiction
of a love so
powerful
as to be
combustive
Surrender to Carol’s ravishing beauty
Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara burn bright in Todd Haynes’ most beautiful film yet
Blanchett’s Carol, although on
the surface more composed, is
perhaps even more vulnerable than
the young Therese. Hidden beneath
the veneer of make-up and furs
that mark her as a possession of the
affluent, Carol seems impenetrable:
confident in her wants and needs;
resolute in her refusal to live against
her own grain. And yet Blanchett’s
nuanced performance teases out the
complexity of the character. Therese
is not just a plaything, a passing
infatuation; at multiple points
Carol lets her guard down, in a
performance that – despite the fact
that she is always ready to retreat –
is completely heart-breaking.
For Carol, ‘would you?’ becomes
a rallying cry, one that echoes
throughout the film: ‘would you like
to have lunch with me?’, ‘would you
like to come visit me this Sunday?’,
‘I was hoping you might want to
come live with me – but I guess you
won’t. Would you?’ Earlier on, in
the cinema, one of Therese’s friends
tracks the correlation between
what the characters on screen are
saying and how they really feel;
at points like these, where Carol
breaks down the barriers she’s so
carefully constructed, there is a true
intersection between desire and
action.
Carol is a visually stunning,
emotionally arresting, powerhouse
of a film. Shot through with a
sense of tender melancholy that
– despite the uplifting ending –
imbues it with an aching, almost
nostalgia-like sentiment, Carol is a
depiction of a love so powerful as
to be combustive. Charring all in its
relentless path, we are consumed in
its beautiful fire. It is a lipstick mark
on the rim of a martini glass. It is
the old photograph that has become
too painful to clutch on to. It is the
greatest love story in recent memory.
It is simply ravishing.
