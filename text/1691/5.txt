Imperial should be refunding our tuition fees
following the strike
A group of Imperial students argue this is not solely about loss of contact time. The entirety of
our educational experience has suffered because of the strikes.

E
arlier this year,
while academic
and support staff
were exercising
their right to strike in pro-
test against unfair changes
to their pensions, over
3,000 students signed a
letter to senior manage-
ment asking for a partial
refund in tuition fees. As
a result of the industrial
action, many of us lost out
on contact time, support
from staff, and general
momentum. If, as seems to
be the case across the UK,
universities are business-
es, and we are consumers,
then we have the right to
demand a refund.
These concerns have
been presented to the
senior management of the
College, but the response
we have received has
been lacking. Last month,
several of us heard from
Professor Alice Gast per-
sonally, who sent a state-
ment that has also been
uploaded to the Imperial
website. It reads: “fees
cover all aspects of your
time at Imperial, and are
based on the delivery of
overall outcomes, rather
than being payments for
specific contact hours.”
While we appreciate
Professor Gast recognises
this is about more than just
contact hours, we hope
that by overall outcomes
she does not solely mean
our degree certificates.
Instead, they should refer
to the graduate attributes
listed on Imperial’s own
website. Imperial are
“committed” to ensuring
Imperial graduates will
“Demonstrate deep con-
ceptual understanding of
their chosen discipline”,
“approach challenges
with curiosity, critical
thinking, and creativity”,
and “have developed
into independent learners
with high self-efficacy”,
among others.
To achieve these
aspirational outcomes
requires departments to
deliver the pedagogical
approach outlined in the
excellent new Teaching
and Learning Strategy.
Launching this strategy,
Professor Simone Bui-
tendijk, Vice Provost
(Education), noted the
emphasis on interactive
learning, with “a focus
on increasing the sense of
community and working
with student as partners.”
while Ms Giskin Day, an
Imperial College Principal
teaching fellow, envisaged
classrooms as “interactive
facilitative space(s)”
where dialogue rather
than didactic delivery was
central to learning.
We entirely agree
with this visionary and
aspirational strategy, and
welcome its implementa-
tion at Imperial. However,
Professor Gast appears to
discount the view that our
education had suffered
and as a result, and avoids
the question of the col-
lege’s liability to refund
any of our fees.
While our fees are not
for specific contact hours,
it is precisely because we
have lost this contact time
that we have lost the op-
portunity for dialogue and
interaction, both of which
are central to the College’s
educational strategy. As a
result our education has
suffered. Indeed, this is
the basis of our claims for
compensation. On many
courses, both undergrad-
uate and postgraduate,
we are fortunate to be
partners with our lecturers
in this excellent type of
education; however, it
cannot take place when
our lecturers are on
strike. The educational
experience, which was the
reason that we chose to
come to Imperial, is what
we value so highly, and
not just the outcome.
Our educational ex-
perience should not be
atomised into specific
contact hours, but should
rather be based on the
totality of our learning
experience. This requires
our teachers and fellow
students to be present
in the department, at
seminars, in classes,
and on-line – and not
on strike. The key point
we were making in our
correspondence with the
College is that we have not
just lost specific contact
hours but also momentum
and the excitement and
creativity that comes from
an excellent course. It is
our educational experi-
ence in its entirety that has
suffered as a direct result
of the disruptions arising
from the strike.
Despite assurances
from senior management
about mitigations for the
strike, these have neces-
sarily been minimal and
in no way compensate for
our loss. The fact remains
that our lecturers were on
strike for 14 days in the
Spring Term – more than
a quarter of the total term.
Recovering lost teaching
– funded by the college
– may help to some
extent but needs to fit into
students’existing commit-
ments. Full time students
are very stretched already,
with multiple commit-
ments, and few have
capacity to retrace steps
from the previous term.
Even if it were feasible to
reschedule lost teaching,
the practicalities of doing
so from the student’s point
of view are therefore very
limited. And without full
student participation and
interaction as partners in
learning, the educational
experience is considerably
diminished. Therefore it
can never simply a matter
of replacing missing
teaching sessions at a
later date, particularly for
the practical courses that
were cancelled and which
may be essential for some
students in their future
careers.
The sad fact is that
strikes mean lost produc-
tion. This is the reason that
the College are withhold-
ing pay from our excellent
lecturers who went on
strike. It seems disingen-
uous to us that they can
therefore also assert that
we have not suffered a
loss in our education and
are not due a refund. For
14 days we were unable
to meet with our lecturers
who were union members;
we missed scheduled
teaching sessions; we lost
opportunities to learn.
This is what the totality of
education means to us and
not just the final degree
outcome.
We would like the
College to meet with us
and our union represent-
atives to agree a way
forward that respects
students’loss of education
experience through fair
compensation. We feel
privileged to be students
at Imperial and are for-
tunate to be receiving an
excellent educational ex-
perience. This, however,
did not happen whilst
our lecturers were on
strike. We need to agree
a fair and just formula
to compensate, not only
ourselves, but the 3,000
fellow students who have
signed the letter stating
they believed their educa-
tion would suffer.
