Recent Imperial graduate Konstantin Holzner has been touring the Americas in an old fire engine. Felix has just
caught up with him to hear about the perks of off-season travel to North American national parks.
T
here are many
valid reasons
why you should
visit North
America’s national parks
in high season. It’s when
the weather is reliably
good, when the flowers are
in bloom, or when certain
wildlife encounters are
the most likely. However,
high season comes at a
price, and not just literally.
Many of North America’s
most popular national
parks have become very
crowded, with excited
visitors hunting for
perfect Instagram shots.
The wardens are facing
huge challenges in man-
aging visitor numbers in
a sustainable way, which
allows people to enjoy the
outdoors but also protects
the habitats and species
within the park. So let me
make a case for off-season
travel.
Redwood National
and State Parks
(California)
The Redwood parks
protect just under half
of all remaining coastal
Redwoods, the tallest
trees in the world. The vast
majority of these mag-
nificent trees have fallen
victim to logging in the
past, and since re-grow-
ing them literally takes
hundreds to thousands of
years, restoration of this
old-growth temperate
rainforest is a long game.
For now, these relatively
small protected parks
lend themselves to be
explored on an awesome
road trip along the coast
of Northern California.
There’s a number of spec-
tacular scenic drives right
through the forests, which
are very busy with cars in
high season, particularly
on weekends, and you’ll
likely spend some of your
valuable holiday time
looking for a parking
space. In December, we
only had to share the place
with some deer roaming
undisturbed.
As stunning as the
drives are, to really
experience the Redwood
forests and appreciate
the size of these trees,
you’ve got to go for a
walk in the woods. The
most striking thing for me
was the incredible silence.
The huge trees and the
thick undergrowth muffle
essentially all noise, and
I’ve never been in a place
as quiet as this. But to
enjoy the marvellous tran-
quillity of the forest, you
want only a small number
of cars and hikers in the
park – another reason for
off-season travel.
Denali National Park
and Preserve (Alaska)

ica’s tallest mountain,

A small fraction of what the Yosemite National Park has to offer // Konstantin Holzner
Out of season in North America’s national parks
incredible wilderness
full of mountains and
wildlife but the access
is very limited all year
round. Although in the
main season you can
drive farther into the park
using their tour buses
(private vehicle access
is restricted), I highly
recommend the off-sea-
son, particularly if you’re
into backcountry hiking.
During the summer
months, backcountry
permits are booked out
months in advance, and
people queue from very
early on in the morning
for a small number of
permits allocated on the
day. When we went hiking
there in late September,
we were the only people
with a permit camping out
in the entire six million
acres.
There aren’t many
paths in the park, and
most backcountry exploits
involve advanced nav-
igation with a map and
compass, picking your
own route (it’s possible
to book tours with ex-
perienced back-country
rangers). On our first day,
we followed a river bed
covered in animal tracks.
Moose, wolves, and griz-
zlies are all very active
there. Within ten minutes
of pitching our tent we
saw two moose appear
out of the forest. The next
morning, we woke up in a
few inches of snow and on
our way back saw which
animal tracks were fresh.
Another advantage of
the off-season is that the
flightseeing tours from
nearby Talkeetna through
the mountains (optional
glacier landings available)
aren’t fully booked, so
you can just rock up when
the weather is perfect.
Although expensive, the
views are spectacular!
Tombstone Territorial
Park (Yukon, Canada)
This relatively young
park, located near the
southern terminus of
the infamous Dempster
Highway, protects an
incredible array of rugged
peaks. Wilderness permits
are also usually booked
out months in advance
for the summer months.
In September, however,
we had no trouble ob-
taining a permit to hike
to Grizzly Lake, and the
autumn colours in the
park are spectacular. We
camped out there for two
nights (didn’t see any
grizzlies though) and
were treated to the most
amazing sunset, followed
by an incredible display
of northern lights – you
don’t get those during
the summer either – that
made even the Canadians
in the neighbouring tent
“ooohh” and “aaahh” in
awe.
Yosemite National
Park (California)
Chances are your
last laptop shipped
with one of Yosemite’s
stunning granite walls
as a background picture.
It’s certainly the most
breath-taking North
American national park
I’ve been to but also one
of the busiest. During
high season, people queue
from early in the morning
for a chance to pitch their
tent in the infamous Camp
4. The valley floor is super
busy, and so are the more
accessible hikes. Glacier
Point is probably one of
the most Instagrammed
places on earth, but the
road to get there is closed
during the off-season and
you can only reach it by
foot. So when you’ve
hiked up there, you’re
almost certainly alone.
And even if you’re not,
you can be certain that the
others have also earned
that spectacular view. If
you’re hungry for more,
continue on along the apt-
ly-named Panorama Trail
for more stunning views.
One of Yosemite’s free
shuttle buses will take you
back to where you started
in no time, and some
drivers will even sing you
a song or tell you stories
of the park’s history.

Grand Canyon and Death Valley: the pride of South-West USA

D
uring my three
day stay in
Las Vegas, I
decided to visit
two of the most famous
North American national
parks – Grand Canyon in
Arizona and Death Valley
in California. They were
a huge contrast from the
busy and posh Vegas,
and were an integral part
of my US experience.
While one day is more
than enough for the
famous casino and party
city, even if you’re keen
to visit every single hotel
on the Strip, the parks are
so huge (and so far away
from the city) that you
could easily spend a few
days there and still have
lots left to explore.
Grand Canyon
Tour companies offer
one- or two-day trips to
South or West Rims of
the canyon, each a bit
different to suit every-
one’s taste. For example,
the South Rim tours are
usually the cheapest,
while the West Rim tours
include a skywalk (at
extra cost) and a visit to
a local Native American
village. Most companies
also offer a helicopter tour
for an additional fee.
I visited the South Rim,
and the tour included a
stopover at the Hoover
Dam and Lake Mead. We
also passed the Colorado
River. At the canyon, we
were given three hours
to walk around, most
of which was spent just
walking along the edge
of this never-ending,
breath-taking natural
wonder, reading about
its history along the way
and admiring the views.
There were also a couple
of points to climb down
for a challenge and a more
Instagrammable view.
Death Valley
Also unbelievably
huge, the Death Valley
national park offers a
range of unforgettable
sights. The most famous
one is the Badwater Basin,
the second lowest point in
the Western hemisphere,
consisting of salt deposits.
Another impressive place
is the Artist’s Palette – a
range of dunes made of
colourful sand. Besides
that, you can find sand
dunes, rocks, trees, and
some short vegetation in
the Valley if you know
where to go. I didn’t
manage to see the whole
park in my one-day tour,
especially since it took
a while to get there from
Vegas. On the plus side,
we came back to Vegas
rather early which allow
ed us some time to explore
the city.
Guided bus tours: yay
or nay?
Before going to any
national park, it’s impor-
tant to decide whether
you’re renting a car or
booking a tour, since
there’s usually no chance
of reaching them by
public transport (or the
hassle is real). The biggest
disadvantage of the tours
is the price (e.g. $200pp
for Death Valley), which
is much more expensive
than a rental car and
the park entrance fee,
especially if you split the
cost among a group of
travellers. Also, the tours
don’t give you enough
time to explore the area
at your own pace or stop
anywhere you want (and
longer trips with over-
night stay naturally cost
even more).
However, having a
guide is handy since
you not only get to hear
interesting facts about
places you’re passing
by but also don’t have to
worry about getting lost
or experiencing problems
with the car, which, for
example, can spontane-
ously stop working in the
extreme heat in the middle
of the desert. In my case,
the weather in Grand
Canyon happened to be
much different from hot
and dry +40o
C in Vegas
– it was rainy, windy, and
you could see lightning
bolts in the distance.
And though I couldn’t
complain – I was at the
freakin’ Grand Canyon
with a double rainbow in
the sky – I have to admit
I was relieved knowing
my bus will take me back
to my accommodation
safely. If I had drove there
by myself and wandered
somewhere far away along
the narrow paths, getting
suddenly caught in such a
storm in the middle of the
Canyon would not have
been fun. Finally, the tours
also supply unlimited
bottled water that comes
in handy in the heat as
well as modest breakfast
and lunch.
Overall, I’d say the
guided tours are safer and
more reliable than going
on your own and might
be worth the extra money
but they won’t allow you
enough time to explore
everything in your own
time as you’ll always be
on a tight schedule, with
no flexibility. But if you’re
confident enough to opt
for a rental car, make sure
you’re well prepared and
have GPS signal!
