rankings, re-
leased last week, saw
Imperial climb one spot
to 4th
best university in
the country. The Uni-
versity of St. Andrews
fell two places from the
2017 rankings, moving
Imperial and the London
School of Economics
(LSE) up one place
each. LSE has retained
its position just ahead of
Imperial for the fourth
year in a row, while the
top of the table is dom-
inated by Oxford and
Cambridge.
The overall score for
Imperial in the CUG
league tables – which take
into account entry stand-
ards, student satisfaction,
research quality, and grad-
uate prospects – was 930,
compared to 935 for LSE
and 928 for St. Andrews.
The CUG also publish-
es yearly subject rankings,
which have seen a number
of changes for Imperial.
Mechanical Engineering
and Computing have each
moved up a place to 2nd
best in the UK, while
Chemical Engineering
and Civil Engineering
have dropped a place each
to 3rd
and 2nd respective-
ly. Chemistry has moved
up two places to 4th
in
the UK, while Medicine
has seen the largest gain,
rising three places to put
the subject 5th
nationwide.
However, student
satisfaction remains an
issue. While it has shown
a year-on-year improve-
ment in the CUG tables
– jumping from a rating of
3.99 to 4.07 out of five – it
remains the second worst
of the top-ten universi-
ties. LSE was the only
top-ten university with a
lower rating for student
satisfaction. Mathematics,
Aeronautical Engineer-
ing, Biology, and Physics
at Imperial all showed low
student satisfaction, with
a score lower than four.
The Department of
Physics had the lowest
student satisfaction rating
of all subjects at Imperial.
Its ranking of 3.68 marked
physics at Imperial as the
worst for student satisfac-
tion out of all universities
surveyed.
The student satisfaction
rates used by CUG were
generated by results of the
National Student Survey
(NSS). A number of
universities saw students
boycotting the NSS,
meaning their results were
omitted.
The physics department
has been facing issues
with student satisfaction
for a number of years: last
year Imperial’s NSS data
showed physics students
were the least satisfied of
all departments, with only
2/3 students reporting
being satisfied with their
course. Particular issues
were raised with feedback,
marking, and the lack of a
sense of community.
While the Department
of Physics has put in place
a number of changes to
address student concerns,
those who spoke to Felix
reported the rate of change
was slow. Communica-
tion from the department
was a particular issue:
one student described
the emails they received
