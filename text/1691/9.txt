mass-surveillance tech-
niques used by govern-
ments.
In 2013 Dr. Aleksandr
Kogan, a research associ-
ate at the Department of
Psychology of Cambridge
University built a 3rd
-party
profiling application to use
for his research. By 2014,
Facebook had updated
their terms and conditions
which no longer permitted
new 3rd
party applications
to harvest friends’ data or
be used for psychometric
profiling. However this
did not apply to the ap-
plication that Kogan had
built in the previous year.
In early 2014 Kogan had
been introduced to SCL
Elections and in May of
the same year formed the
company Global Science
Research (GSR) to create
a data-licensing contract
between itself and SCL
Elections, an affiliate of
CambridgeAnalytica. The
contract stipulated that
the funding transferred to
GSR was to be used “to
further develop, add to,
refine, and supplement
A deep dive: Cambridge Analytica
C

Analytica have
been success-
fully controlling
the minds of thousands of
people – if not hundreds
of thousands – since 2013.
Working for political par-
ties for over 200 elections
in the United States and
the United Kingdom, as
well as Argentina, the
Czech Republic, Kenya,
India, and Nigeria, they
may have singlehandedly
swung the outcome of
two controversial knife-
edge votes. In 2016
they acted in the U.S.
Presidential Elections and
likely the U.K. European
Referendum – the full
extent of their actions may
never be known.
It all began on the
21st
April, 2010, when
Facebook announced
Open Graph, a tool for 3rd
party application develop-
ers allowing them to ask
the user for permission
to access their personal
data; at the time this also
included access to the
personal data of all the
friends of a user. As of
2017, the average number
of ‘friends’ for every
profile was 338 people
(median at 200); given
the number of people
who directly accessed
the app is anywhere from
185,000 to 300,000 we
have an enormous amount
of potentially affected
people. Cambridge Ana-
lytica claim the number
of people whose data was
harvested was 30 million,
whilst Facebook claim
this number is 87 million.
Whichever way you look
at it, the sheer amount of
data that could have been
sourced surpasses the
level of current known
GS psychometric scoring
algorithms, databases
and scores” from which
Kogan and his partner
Joseph Chancellor could
not profit directly from.
The Guardian pub-
lished an exposé in
December 2015 on the
involvement of Cam-
bridge Analytica in aiding
Ted Cruz’s presidential
campaign with the use of
Facebook user data. After
this publication Facebook
ceased their collaboration
with Dr. Kogan and asked
him to delete all the
data acquired by GSR.
Facebook and Dr. Kogan
had a close relationship,
with Facebook sharing
aggregate user data to
feed into GSR models.
These models were used
by GSR to match person-
alities with voter record
data provided by SCL
Elections to be able to
target voters.
The contract between
GSR and SCL Elections
stated that the predictions
made by this model were
comparable to, if not more
accurate than, those made
by close acquaintances of
test groups. This claim,
however, is unsubstantiat-
ed and there is no reason
to believe that targeting
on an individual basis was
possible. This does not
mean that group targeting
was not possible with
a sufficient prediction
rate for it to be viable:
even with a conservative
50% correct prediction
outcome on a group size
of a couple of hundred
can be an important factor
when some elections were
won by a few hundred
votes. Once Cambridge
Analytica established
their target groups, media
content would be created,
curated, and published
based on the groups’
personal interests and
political beliefs; they
would then would use
marketing platforms with
specific targeting tools,
such as Facebook itself, to
reach voters with the right
material.
Something that might
hit closer to home is with
a company called Aggre-
gateIQ, who were affili-
ated with the SCL group,
the parent company of
Cambridge Analytica.
AggregateIQ was hired by
the ‘Vote Leave’campaign
team called BeLeave,
£625,000 was donated
from the official Vote
Leave campaign for the
referendum, all of which
was used to pay AIQ for
their services. In total
£3.5 million was paid to
AIQ for their services by
the different Vote Leave
campaigns.
It would be impossible
to ever estimate how
successful Cambridge
Analytica, SCL Elections,
and Global Science
Research were at con-
verting masses of data
into votes; however, these
events show us some
of the more dangerous
effects of powerful
computing technology
we have developed. So-
cial-media services like
Facebook are wielding
powerful currency in this
new age, this currency
being our personal data.
With millions of people
sharing data publicly
with minimal privacy
restrictions, it becomes
increasingly profitable to
record and store as much
data as possible on as
many people as possible.
In a dystopian society it is
easy to imagine govern-
ments going through all
our data and controlling
what we see on a massive
scale. Legislation can at
best control where our
data is stored, who it is
shared with, and what the
data is used for, however
it is slow to be written and
implemented. It will be
extremely difficult to take
back control of our data.
