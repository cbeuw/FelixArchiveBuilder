Y
ou know the
feeling. You’re
approaching
your eighth
solid hour in Central
Library, trying to do some-
thing that comes remotely
close to revision, but can
feel your concentration
dwindling away with
each passing moment.
It’s time for a break, but
what to do? The lining of
your stomach can’t handle
another cup of library
coffee, your Facebook
feed is full of people you
don’t really like talking
about how much work
they’re doing, and you’ve
already swiped through
everyone in a five-mile
radius on Tinder.
What about a quick
episode of a TV show?
You open up Netflix, and
cast your eye around for
the latest release. Maybe
some comedy? Or what
about that independent
British drama that’s been
getting a lot of good
reviews in the press? Oh,
and your friend recom-
mended checking out that
sitcom about millenials
living in New York City,
he said it’s different from
all the other ones that have
come before…
Before you know it,
two hours have passed
by, and you end up just
watching another episode
of The Big Bang Theory,
as you slowly fill with
self-loathing.
Never fear. Felix TV
is here to help. Here are
a few of our favourite
shows to get you through
the revision period,
guaranteed to provide
a welcome break from
fluid mechanics, and earn
you some dirty looks for
hogging up a precious seat
in the computer lab.
Bojack Horseman
Created by Raphael
Bob-Waksberg, and
boasting a stellar cast
– Will Arnett, Amy
Sedaris, and Alison Brie,
among others – as well
as cameos from everyone
from Daniel Radcliffe to
Paul McCartney, Bojack
Horseman is a darkly
satirical take on the Holly-
wood industry, which also
addresses heavy-hitting
issues related to mental
health, failure, and isola-
tion. Bojack, a washed-up
star of a 1990s sitcom,
spends his days drinking
heavily, and pushing away
everybody who cares for
him as his self-hatred
deepens.
Those he alienates
include his agent Princess
Carolyn – a magnificent
Amy Sedaris in a ca-
reer-best performance
– who puts on a bright
attitude to cover up
what’s lacking in her
personal life; and Diane
Nguyen (Alison Brie), a
ghostwriter with ideals
and intellect, trapped in
a world of showbiz and a
mismatched marriage.
While the premise
might sound disillusion-
ing, the script keeps things
engaging, shot through
with a morbid wit and a
penchant for wordplay.
Clocking in at 25 minutes
each, the episodes deal
with sensitive subject
matter in a clear and
emancipatory manner.
Besides, after watching a
couple of episodes, your
life might not seem quite
so bad.

Midnight Diner: Tokyo
Stories
Based on a manga
series, Midnight Diner:
Tokyo Stories is one of a
number of foreign series
purchased by Netflix as
part of its all-consuming
expansion. While Netflix
originals like The Crown
or House of Cards may be
known for their dramatic
plots and snappy dialogue,
what makes Midnight
Diner so appealing is
simply how little actually
happens each episode.
The show, as the
name would suggest,
revolves around a diner
in Shinjuku, which is
exclusively open during
the night, fuelling the
inhabitants of this 24-hour
city. Operated by a single
man – known as ‘The
Master’ – the diner will
make whatever the clien-
tele request, provided the
ingredients are available.
Each episode features a
single dish, which serves
as an introduction to the
problems or challenges
facing individual patrons
– whether that’s pickled
plums reminding a man
of his deceased mother,
or rice omelettes exposing
the cultural tensions
between Japan and Korea.
There are no denoue-
ments, or dramatic overar-
ching story arcs. Instead,
each episode unfurls
at its own slow pace,
offering a nuanced and
multi-layered insight into
the diner’s patrons. It’s a
truly humanist piece of
television, one that simply
asks you to allow yourself
to be carried along with it.
Available on Netflix
RuPaul’s Drag Race
Currently in its tenth
season, RuPaul’s Drag
Race has gone from a
tiny competition with a
shoestring budget, to a
global empire, and one of
the most exciting reality
television shows currently
being broadcast.
For the unititiated, the
show pits a group of drag
queens against each other
through a series of chal-
lenges, designed to test
their ‘Charisma, Unique-
ness, Nerve, and Talent’.
Each week the contestants
need to act, dance, and sew
their assess off, watched
over by legendary drag
queen RuPaul, before the
two bottom contestants go
head to head in a lip sync
battle. The queen who
is left at the end of the
competition is crowned
‘America’s Next Drag
Superstar’.
Out of this premise, the
show has generated over
100 episodes of twists
and turns, and become a
cultural touchstone for
a new generation of TV,
cropping up everywhere
from SNL to the derivative
Lip Sync Battle.
What the show does so
well – and what makes it
excellent revision-break
material – is to offer
complete escapism from
everyday life. It takes
the viewer to a world of
artifice and heightened
reality, while always
retaining a punchy wit
that pokes fun at the entire
notionofrealitytelevision.
With episodes clocking in
at 45-60 minutes each,
this provides a bit more
of a substantial break, but
leaves you inspired by all
the talent on display on
the screen.
