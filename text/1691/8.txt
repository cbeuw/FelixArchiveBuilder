Lab-grown heart used for drug safety testing
C
urrently, drug
safety testing
has to be ini-
tially conducted
on animals, before trials
in humans begin. While
animal models have
proven to be useful, in
some respects, they do
not wholly mimic human
reactions.
One of my lecturers’
favourite examples is tha-
lidomide – a mild sleeping
tablet that was proven
safe in adults. Animal
studies and human drug
trials failed to detect its
harmful effects on devel-
oping foetuses, and, as a
result, in 1962 thousands
of babies worldwide were
born with malformed
limbs.
This disaster led to in-
creased stringency of the
drug testing process, but
did not reduce the fears
of expecting mothers –
pregnant women are less
likely, for example, to
take long or short-term
medications to help
control their symptoms of
insomnia.
However, a recent study
in March by a research
group in Syracuse Uni-
versity, New York may
have just found a reliable,
clinically-relevant model
to allow drug safety
testing in embryos! This
involves using stem cells
– unspecialised cells that
can be turned into differ-
ent type of cells, such as
heart cells. By utilising
bioengineering principles,
the research group in US
were able to generate a
heart in the early stages of
development using stem
cells.
Current problems with
growing a developing
heart (also known as
cardiac organoid) in the
laboratory centre around
the immaturity of the
cells themselves. Those
that were grown on a dish
are simply not the correct
shape or orientation, and
therefore they have differ-
ent functional properties
to those inside a human.
To resolve this, the
group used biomaterials
– substances that are able
to interact with cells –
combined with stem cells,
to drive stem cell special-
isation into heart cells, as
well as encouraging cell
maturation. The group
patterned the biomaterial
by creating the correct
geometric confinement on
the biomaterial, and, con-
sequently, a 3D cardiac
cell culture that mimics
early heart development
was able to be formed
in approximately three
weeks.
Since human stem cells
are used, these organoids
are well suited for drug
screening, because it
eliminates the species dif-
ference between animals
and humans; this means
patients can now have
greater confidence when
taking medications, and,
perhaps, fewer animals are
required for drug testing.
In parallel, understanding
the factors that influence
human heart development
may allow for the study
of developmental heart
abnormalities, allowing
scientists to find treat-
ments for congenital heart
defects.
The technology is still
in its infancy, and the
applications may only be
limited to early defects
at present. Furthermore,
there are still discrepancy
between the heart that
grows inside a human,
and that which is grown
in the lab. More research
is required, but the future
prospects remain exciting.
Science and eternity – perspectives on immortality
O
ne of the most
recent hot
topics in the
field of science
and technology centres
around Netcome – a pri-
vate company who have
set out to preserve human
brains post-mortem, such
that, one day, following
technological advance-
ments, they would be
able to “recreate your
mind”. Nectome bases
their business plan on
award-winning research
which resulted in the
intact preservation of
an animal connectome.
This was done via a
process called vitrifix-
ation: a combination of
chemical embalming and
cryogenics which enabled
the team to preserve all
the synaptic structures
within a rodent.
cality. Neuroscience poses
difficult questions, some
of which have answers
that would prove crucial
for this project, such as
the fact that it is cur-
rently unknown whether
an intact cryogenised
connectome would retain
the information that once
circulated through the
brain. Moreover, we do
not know whether the
information we want to
retain is actually related
to the biological basis of
consciousness. For vitri-
fixation to be successful,
the brain needs to be
removed fresh; while the
protocol for replicating
the procedure for human
use is currently under
development, this very
idea of transhumanism is
more entertaining, from a
debate point of view, than
ever.
It is not often that
science reaches out to
people en masse, evoking
such strong emotional
reactions, as with the
possibility of eternal life.
Looking back in history,
immortality has always
embraced many spiritual
dimensions, as seen with
the ancient Egyptians,
who were well known for
preserving their leaders’
remains, some of which
still exist day.
The novel approach by
Nectome sounds appeal-
ing, especially in cases
where terminal illnesses
are involved. However,
the implications of such a
project becoming reality
are immense: ethically,
legally, and in terms of
the future of the human
race. Since brain collec-
tion must be completed
imminently at death, this
procedure could only be
conducted in countries or
states where assisted eu-
thanasia is legal. Provided
the protocol is successful,
the person would lose
their body, and possibly
wake up to the prospect
of having a conscious
experience in a research
computer.
This scenario is riddled
with questions. What
would initially be a col-
lection of independent
“consciousness folders”
on research computers
may one day become
the one and only means
of human existence. We
could look at it as an
evolutionary success, as
a new paradigm where
we confront another type
of mortality and begin
the same cycle again, as
a way of achieving unity
and connection with each
living human. Or, from a
different perspective, this
would create a collective
consciousness and serve
as a path to losing what
was initially aimed to
be preserved, the ego,
instead reaching a point
where everything current-
ly known to us through
our subjective experienc-
es becomes nonsensical.
Important advances
and discoveries are still
to be made, both in neu-
roscience and technology,
before we can unequivo-
cally develop a protocol
that would enable human
consciousness to live
forever in a computer
simulation. Until then, we
have to answer questions
such as: “What, in fact,
are we trying to achieve
with this?”

S
ome of you may
have recently
read that the last
male northern
white rhinoceros, called
Sudan, was put down
due to age-related
ailments. The northern
white rhinoceros is a a
now functionally-extinct
subspecies of the white
rhinoceros, with only
two females remaining.
This day was imminent
– with such a small
surviving population
size, their chances to
recover seemed unlikely.
However, what has
been ignored by several
media outlets is that the
southern white rhino is
something of a conserva-
tion success story.
It is still argued whether
or not the southern and
northern white rhinos
represent subspecies
of the white rhino, or
whether they are two
entirely separate species.
For arguments sake, we
are going to assume,
using current knowledge,
that they are both closely
related subspecies.
Let’s start with the
southern white rhino,
which experienced a pop-
ulation crash, with reports
from the early 1900s that
as little as 50-100 individ-
uals remaining in the wild.
But, thanks to population
recovery efforts across the
globe, the southern white
rhinos have bounced
back, with a population
size today amounting to
over 21,000! Of course,
with so many rhinos in
such a small place, many
have been reintroduced
to previous areas of their
range. Their status on the
International Union for the
Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) Red List has also
been down-listed to Near
Threatened, and, despite
this, population efforts
remain ongoing in order
to safeguard the rhinos
for the future in light of
illegal ivory poaching.
These efforts are in need
of worthy celebrations,
but this message – that
rhino conservation is
working – is difficult to
portray to individuals.
It may come of a
surprise to you, but there
are three smaller rhino
species living within Asia,
aside from the two in
Africa. The Sumatran rhi-
noceros is the only living
rhino species left which
is woolly; most people
would have thought that
the last of these died out
at the end of the last ice
age but in fact, they are
clinging on in south-east
Asia. They are now listed
as Critically Endangered,
with only five substantial
populations remaining in
the wild: four on Sumatra
and one on Borneo. Their
rainforest homes have
slowly been reduced as
humans have expanded
agriculture and cities in
the previous range of the
species. Their numbers
are a lot more difficult
to determine, as they are
solitary animals which are
widely scattered through-
out their range – however,
there are estimates that
fewer than 100 animals
remain. This species
represents a group with
no other living members:
the woolly rhinos. When
they become extinct, will
we see the same media
outcry? We are starting
down the slippery slope
to extinction, and now
is the time to act, before
they too are just another
casualty of the Anthro-
pocene.

Let’s talk about sex(ual health)
T
hey say your
years at univer-
sity are some of
the best of your
life. That the lessons you
will learn and the experi-
ences you will gain will
be paramount in forming
who you are as a person.
However, it does not
always feel that way. For
many of us the transition
from the shelter of our
homes to the whirlwind
that is university can be
overwhelming, and ad-
justing to this newfound
independence can feel
like a continuous struggle.
All too often we end up
neglecting to take care of
ourselves (we’ve all had
that sad bowl of cereal
for dinner, right?). Even if
you do happen to be one
of those super humans
who find the time to study,
eat healthily, exercise,
and maintain a social life,
there is still one aspect of
our health that is greatly
overlooked: our sexual
health.
Why is Sexual Health
Important?
University is a time of
firsts, with many students
finding themselves
sexually as well as aca-
demically. Being aware of
our bodies is an integral
part of maintaining
honest, healthy, and ulti-
mately satisfying sexual
relationships. We believe
that raising awareness on
this issue and providing
students with the correct
tools can help to facilitate
this, making everyone
healthier and happier!
That is why the Sexual
Health Campaign team
conducted a survey of 155
Imperial students in which
70% of participants ex-
pressed interest in having
a sexual health campaign
and testing services.
The Campaign
The Sexual Health
Campaign at Imperial is a
new student-led campaign
that was started by two
postgraduates in the
School of Public Health; it
now has student members
from across the university,
and collaborated with the
Union to empower and
educate about sex.
We have partnered
with local sexual health
clinics to provide full
sexual health check-ups
for students, as well as
launching an awareness
campaign to promote safe,
consensual sex for all.
How you can get in-
volved
Our campaign days are
open to undergraduate and
postgraduate students on
three Wednesdays: May
9th
: (South Kensington),
16th
(Charing Cross) and
23rd
(South Kensington)
from 11am to 4pm.
Drop by, we would love
to help answer any ques-
tions you may have about
the health check-ups, the
campaign, or just about
safe sex. In addition,
the Jefferiss Wing at St.
Mary’s Hospital will
provide take-home testing
kits ready to pick up
throughout May.
Hope to see many of
you there, in order to show
Imperial how important
is sexual health for the
student community!
