The way the government have treated these members of our society has put communities,
political faith, and the NHS at risk.

T
he government’s
past few years
of immigration
policy have been
cruel and inhumane,
as highlighted by the
Windrush Scandal. The
arbitrary target to cut
immigration to the tens
of thousands has spawned
some nasty and unexpect-
ed consequences. The
‘hostile environment’
policy adopted whilst
Theresa May was Home
Secretary is the culmi-
nation of the path this
government has ardently
pursued, and has attempt-
ed to make it as difficult as
possible to live in the UK
without having the appro-
priate documentation to
prove a right to remain.
show their right to live
in the UK. Anyone from
the Commonwealth who
arrived in the UK before
1971 had a right to British
citizenship but, due to
the hostile policy, many
of these people have
been asked to prove their
right to remain here after
decades of living in the
UK. Imagine living in a
country you have called
home for decades only
for a letter demanding
you prove you have the
right to live here or you
will be deported. This is
the situation thousands
of individuals have had
to face. Most of these
people have spent their
entire lives contributing to
society and communities;
to call into question their
citizenship is a point of
shamethatthegovernment
should and must bear. It is
a gut-wrenching experi-
ence to be so profoundly
neglected and shunned by
the nation you have lived
in and paid your dues.
To be denied the right
to access healthcare and
the right to work for the
sake of meeting migration
targets is disgusting.
The government’s
handlingofthescandalhas
been dire to say the least.
The now former Home
Secretary, Amber Rudd,
was either incompetent
or deceitful – in reality
probably both. She failed
to comprehend the nature
and scale of the problem,
not only when it was
raised with her last year,
but also as the scandal has
developed this year. The
government have failed
to go far enough to show
genuine contrition for the
pain they have caused, nor
done enough to resolve
the situation for the thou-
sands of people who have
been affected. The Home
Office is a notoriously
difficult department to
manage, and Amber Rudd
essentially admitted this
herself by saying that she
was focusing so much
on counter-terrorism that
she took her eye off the
ball with immigration.
Ultimately, if the safety of
the country is the Home
Office’s greatest priority,
and a massive job in and
of itself, it might be time
to consider separating
one of great offices of
state in two – not only
for the benefit of the poor
Member of Parliament left
to the run the department,
but also for the country as
government to take. There
have been approximately
5,000 doctors who have
been refused entry into the
UK due to these quotas.
The NHS has been faced
with one of the trickiest
periods in its existence: it
has severe staff shortages,
and hospital trusts have,
quite rightly, been recruit-
ing from abroad to fill
these gaps so the NHS is
able to continue to provide
an amazing service.
The government, on
the one hand, claims
it is doing everything
possible to support the
NHS through this difficult
time, and yet on the other
hand is actively prevent-
ing doctors entering the
country. The NHS have
recognised the impor-
tance of getting qualified
staff in place as quickly
as possible to support the
health service; it’s a shame
that the government have
been unable to recognize
this fact despite the NHS
falling apart around them.
Regardless of whatever
immigration targets the
government has foolishly
tied its hands to, it should
be brave enough to say
we need doctors urgently
and that it is committed to
sorting this problem.
The road the gov-
ernment has decided to
follow on immigration
will not benefit anyone. It
is preventing doctors from
doing their jobs and si-
multaneously has thrown
the lives of thousands
into chaos. Many citizens
voted for Brexit so the
UK could take control of
its borders the Windrush
scandal shows the gov-
ernment can’t be trusted
to control our borders as
it is, let alone once Brexit
actually happens.

The Windrush Scandal
has developed from such
a policy. People came to
the UK from the Com-
monwealth following
World War Two to settle
and work; however, many
of these people, especially
minors, did not apply
for British passports or
official documents to

A further consequence
of the government’s
attempts to slash immigra-
tion to ‘acceptable’ levels
is that the government has
refused entry to the UK
of thousands of highly
skilled migrants, as they
have already filled quotas
for the month. This is an
entirely ludicrous and
illogical position for the
