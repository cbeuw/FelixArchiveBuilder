to all intents and purposes
like an ordinary croissant.
But delve deeper into the
pastry and you will find
an unexpected texture.
Instead of the flaky buttery
soft consistency typical of
a croissant, the inside of a
cornetto resembles bread,
but is sweet. Soft, yes,
but structured. Perfect for
spreading your favourite
breakfast topping onto,
be that Nutella, jam or
marmalade.
5. Aperitivo is the
perfect budget dinner
Does an all-you-can-
eat buffet and a cocktail
for 10 euros sound good
to you? In London, just
the cocktail alone can cost
£10. The Italian aperitivo
is a pre-dinner drink
often accompanied by
Seven things I learnt about Italian food from my trip
to Rome
Italian food is not just pizza and pasta. Food Editor Alice Davage learnt more about the celebrated cuisine during
her Easter travels and wants to tell you all about it. Lucky you.

L
et’s face it, one of
the main reasons
why people visit
Italy is for the
food. Yes, there is also
bucket loads of history
to gaze at in awe and the
sunshine is a nice change
from the UK, but really,
the food is the main event.
When I say “Italian food,”
what comes into your
mind? Pizza and pasta?
Maybe gelato? While
visiting a friend on her
Erasmus year abroad in
Rome, I endeavoured
to scratch beneath the
surface of the average
pizza crust and find out a
bit more about the local
cuisine and how the locals
treat their food. Read on
to find out what I learnt.
Spoilers: it’s not just
about the carbs; although,
they are mentioned a lot.
1. Whipped cream on
ice cream works
This is not unheard of
cream on top of scoops of
gelato in Rome. Cream on
cream - too much? British
people mix custard with
ice cream after all, which
is a much quirkier combi-
nation. Why don’t we add
whipped cream here? The
next London Instagram
craze, anyone?
2. Fondant chocolate in
ice cream is magic
While we are on the
topic of gelato, I tried
“Iced
espresso... a
much needed
mid-afternoon
pick-me-up”
freezer sections.
3. Truffle is multi-func-
tional
Imagine this: a beauti-
ful platter laden with a se-
lection of cheeses, hams,
olives and bread covered
in poppy seeds in a little
red basket on the side.
One mystery cheese sticks
out. Originally, I think
the mystery ingredient
looks like a cross between
olives and mushrooms.
After tasting it I decided
it was neither and looked
quizzically at the friend
sitting across me. She
saw my confused face
and explained that it was
finger-food brought to the
table or access to an exten-
sive buffet. Although not
designed to replace your
dinner, aperitivo certainly
can for those travelling on
a budget. Give it a go next
time you are in Rome.
6. Iced espresso is a
summer energy boost
Served in a small glass
similar to a shot glass, iced
7. Food is stationary
A commuter shoving a
pre-made sandwich into
their mouth while running
down the steps into the
tube station may be a
normal sight in London,
but no such thing is seen
in Rome. In fact, it is rare
to see boxed sandwiches
and other on-the-move
lunch items in general.
Instead, food is eaten at
the table and enjoyed
at a leisurely pace. An
espresso is enjoyed at the
counter. Steps are littered
with people eating pizza
slices and gelato under
the water sprays from
ornate fountains. Food
is savoured, not scoffed.
After all, why would you
rush through a master-
piece?

probably truffle. Appar-
ently, truffle is a common
ingredient in Rome, often
added to pizza with ham,
pasta, and oil.
4. Cornetti look like
croissants (but don’t be
fooled)

in Britain, where elaborate
sundaes and banana splits
are often garnished with

surprise, it was standard
for ice cream parlours to
offer a dollop of whipped
“Rich fondant

sauce”
some that was unlike
any version of ice-cream
I have ever had before.
The gelateria Blue Ice,
located adjacent to the
Fontana di Trevi (Trevi
Fountain), offers a rather
indulgent white chocolate
and raspberry flavour.
However, the white
chocolate component was
less like traditional gelato
and more like the fondant
white chocolate you get
in puddings. The rich
fondant white chocolate
could’ve been too sickly
sweet, but was balanced
off by plenty of sharp
raspberry sauce running
through the gelato. There
was far more raspberry
than the often pathetic
amount found in the
average raspberry ripple
you find in tubs in UK
espresso is a great alterna-
tive to the conventional
warm espresso. Served
with a dash of sugar to
take the edge off the
bitterness, iced espresso
can be sipped and enjoyed
in the sun when a much
needed mid-afternoon
pick-me-up is required.
