Fashioned from Nature, but at what cost?
The V&A’s exhibition latest explores the history of fashion, from its environmental cost to sustainable eco-fashion
today.
F
ashion is un-
natural – and
distinctly human.
Whether you pay
much attention to it or not,
the clothes that you wear
express something about
your individuality and,
in turn, each of us have
a personal and subjective
response to fashion.
The V&A’s Fashioned
from Nature exhibition
makes you aware of this
personal response. The
exhibition displays the
natural with the unnatural,
with a bizarre juxtaposi-
tion of real animal bones
and furs next to dresses
designed to turn women
into the living embod-
iment of flowers. The
atmosphere feels slightly
jarring, with recordings
of birdsong mixed with
a mechanical clacking
of looms and sewing
machines.
And yet the designs
are beautiful, celebrating
nature through floral

prints and exotic natural
materials, meeting our
aesthetic desire for some-
thing new. Through its
display of fashion from
the 1600s next to natural
history specimens and
new innovative fabrics,
the exhibition asks us to
look frankly at the past
and make up our own
minds on whether or not
we can design a more
sustainable future for the
industry.
For all the beauty of the
clothing and drawings,
the exhibition leaves you
feeling uncomfortable
as you read about the
damage the industry has
had on the environment.
The mechanisation of
cloth production in the
1700s was one of the main
drivers of the industrial
revolution; the industry
boomed as the population
of Britain tripled during
the following century.
More and more coal
was used to fuel the high
volume of production,
polluting the air and
water. Our desire for the
exotic led to the poaching
of exotic animals for their
furs, hides, and feathers.
Displayed, we see female
corsets and dresses
stiffened with baleen,
or whalebone, and hear
about how this trend led
to the severe over-hunting
of whales.
And yet, despite all
of the damage, we see
how humans have been
inspired by nature; the
use of fur and feathers
in fashion was paired
with a significant societal
interest in natural history
and botany, demonstrated
by a multitude of floral
designs, and detailed
drawings from books
published in the same era.
As the exhibition
transports us into the
20th
century, we see
how fashion adapted to
accommodate a desire
for change, providing a
medium through which
we could reflect our social
concerns.
By the 80s a number
of popular designers were
starting to use fashion as a
way of raising awareness
to the damage humans
are doing to the planet.
T-shirts started carrying
slogans, encouraging
people to think and act
on topics such as nuclear
weapons, famine, and the
environment. Alexander
McQueen used prominent
images of nature to make
us consider our attitudes
towards the environment
and Stella McCartney
aimed to combine great
design with sustainable
materials. We are brought
into an era of ‘eco-fashion’
where consumers are now
encouraged to ask, ‘how
are my clothes made?’and
‘who made them?’.
Having seen how
fashion can be used to
spreadideas,weareshown
how designers have cata-
lysed innovations which
are making textiles and
manufacturing processes
increasingly environmen-
tally friendly. We see the
stunning Calvin Klein
dress worn by Emma
Watson to the Met Gala
in 2016 which was made
completely of recycled
plastic bottles. Eco-hybrid
designs, cellulose couture,
modern leather grown
from mycelium, a dress
grown from roots. You
can hear Vivienne West-
wood’s vision of moving
towards a sustainable
fashion future come to
life. Her advice: “buy less,
choose well, make it last”.
This thought-provoking
exhibition gives a frank
and, ironically, unattrac-
tive history of fashion, but
it also highlights the role it
has played and still plays
in spreading ideas and
shaping culture. When

FASHIONED FROM
NATURE
fashion industry, I find
myself optimistic.
Though fashion may
The photographer as painter, sculptor, artist
Tate Modern’s Shape of Light exhibition is a great history lesson in abstract photography, but neglects
contemporary post-1970s technology and artwork.
F
rom the dawn
of the age of
the camera,
photography as
an artistic medium has
been consistently set apart
from the tradition of fine
art. Henry Fox Talbot,
one of the fathers of the
photographic process,
wrote in the mid-19th
century that photographic
plates “are impressed by
the agence of Light alone,
without any aid whatever
from the artist’s pencil.”
Here was a medium that
could represent the world
around us as it really is,
and whose starting point
is not the intangible
artistic imagination, but
the concrete physical
reality of light. In a turn
of phrase characteristic of
the new possibilities pho-
tography posed, he called
photos “the sun-pictures
themselves.”
It is against this dichot-
omy, which places pho-
tography as a counterpoint
to fine art, that the curators
of the Tate Modern’s latest
exhibition rail. Set out as
a ‘manifesto exhibition’,
Shape of Light aims to
track a century of abstract
photography, and – in the
process – break down
distinctions, placing the
photographer on an equal
level with the sculptor
or painter. They already
have, as their starting
point, a model for how to
go about doing this: 291,
the legendary art gallery
managed by Alfred
Stieglitz, aimed to place
photography on the same
level as more accepted
art forms, proving it
could be a medium just
as artistically fecund as
oils or marble. As viewers
progress through the ex-
hibition, we can see how
artists attempt to build up
the essence of abstraction
through the developing
language of photography
– a language that is still
developing today.
The pioneers of the
practice of abstract
photography are present,
as you would expect:
Man Ray, Lazslo Mo-
holy-Nagy, Paul Strand.
In Man Ray’s case, the
curators have managed to
secure a series of his ‘Un-
concerned Photographs’,
taken by swinging a
polaroid camera around,
leaving it to chance what
would be in the view-
finder’s range when the
shutter closed. The work
acts as a playful correc-
tive to the output of more
formal photographers,
reminding us that abstract
photography can be just as
much about joy as about
technique.
By showing photos
alongside sculpture and
paintings, the curators
draw our attention to how
photographic technique
developed alongside
artistic movements,
and – in certain cases –
preempted them. Thus
Alvin Langdon Coburn’s
‘Vortographs’, a term
coined by Ezra Pound,
hang alongside Vorticist
work by Wyndham
Lewis – one black
and white, the other in
eye-popping colour, both
are linked through their
dizzying visuals. In other
rooms we’ve got Bridget
Riley’s op art alongside
Gottfried Jäger’s math-
ematics-inspired pho-
tography; Moholy-Nagy’s
structured photographic
compositions acting as a
counterpoint to Theo van
Doesburg’s paintings; the
automatism of Nathan
Lerner’s abstractions hung
next to one of Pollock’s
paint-splattered canvases.
The shadow of the
pioneers of the early-20th
Century – namely those
who emerged from
the Bauhaus, and the
American photographers
they inspired – hangs
heavy over the exhibition,
but the curators do well
to remind us how inter-
national these working
practices were.
A collection of images
from Latin America,
featuring everyday items
in repetitious close-up,
are arrestingly beautiful,
while Chinese amateur
Luo Bonian’s works from
the 1930s use cut-up tech-
niques to create swirling
sepia-toned kaleidoscopes
of imagery. Kansuke
Yamamoto’s 1956 sculp-
ture ‘The Thrilling Game
Related to Photography’
serves as an emblem for
the exhibition as a whole:
a small box containing
an photograph of glass
shards, pierced with the
shards themselves, it
breaks down our separate
conception of ‘sculpture’,
‘art’, and ‘photography’
into a single entity, whilst
alsoretainingasharpsense
of playfulness. Works like
these, little seen within the
mainstream photographic
canon, are the highlights
of the show.
Frustratingly for an
exhibition that promises
to cover a century of
the artform it insists on
focusing on the history
of abstract photography
pre-1970, at the exclusion
of more recent works and
without consideration to
the impact of new tech-
nologies on the ability
of artists to create their
vision.
A single room at
the end of exhibition
affords us the chance to
move into the world of
digital photography. Paul
Graham’s highly-magni-
fied scans of reels of film
reveal the crystals and
pigments which make up
photographic technology,
arranged into beautifully
dynamic patterns that
are given evocative
names like “End of an
Age”. Elsewhere, Antony
Cairns’ frenetic photo-
graphs of bustling cities
have been transferred onto
eReader screens, whose
immobility – detached
from their casing, they
hang inert – contrasts with
the high-energy scenes
portrayed, and Thomas
Ruff has done away with
the photographic process
all together, creating a
‘digital darkroom’ in a
marriage of art and auto-
mation.
Writing in the late
1970s, Susan Sontag
spoke of how American
photography was
becoming defined by a
Unconcerned Photograph (1959) – playful, serendipitous shots // Man Ray
reaction against ‘Westo-
nism’ – “that is, against
contemplative photogra-
phy, photography consid-
ered as an independent
visual exploration of
the world.” Much has
happened since that time,
and yet – by not showing
us how abstract photogra-
phy has moved on since
the 1970s – Shape of
Light merely cements a
narrative that was never
in question. As a history
lesson, it is exceptional,
but as an exhibition it
leaves much to be desired.
“This
exhibition
gives a frank
and, ironically,
unattractive
history of
fashion”
seem fickle, if we look
back over the last century
we can find a number of
constants: a love of detail,
high quality materials,
high standard of work-
manship, and a search for
something new. As ‘con-
scious’ clothing becomes
increasingly fashionable,
it will become ever more
available, as high street
brands adopt and adapt
to the latest innovative
techniques and textiles.
But even if you can
be convinced that we are
headed towards a greener
future, I have to ask, are
you prepared to forgive
fashion for its damaging
past? I’ll let you decide.
