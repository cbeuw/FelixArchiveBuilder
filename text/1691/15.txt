Grid of Points – A ambient meditation on silence and
absence
Grouper’s latest album, recorded in the middle of a cold snap, sees them moving more towards piano and vocals,
in a guarded display of intimacy.
L
iz Harris, the
woman behind
the ambient outfit
Grouper, whose
latest release Grid of
Points dropped last week,
lives in Astoria. It’s a
small town located on the
very northernmost edge of
Oregon, on a strip of land
that abuts the Columbia
river as it bleeds into the
wide Pacific. To look at
images of Astoria is to
look at a town confronted
by the ocean; the land-
scape slopes down to the
bay, from which a solid
steel bridge spans the dual
horizontals of sky and
water.
This openness, this
sense of expanse, or
horizontality, bleeds
into Grouper’s musical
output, which has always
explored a liminal space
between intimacy and
distance. It sounds like
secrets whispered into a
void, which the listener is
privileged to hear. She has
previously spoken about
how releasing an album
was, to her, like sinking an
object into a lake, unseen,
before quietly stealing
away. As such, listening
to Grouper always feels
like a privilege, and –
sometimes – like a trans-
gression.
Grid of Points is a
concise work – lasting
only 22 minutes in
total – but continues the
trajectory set out by her
earlier, longer releases.
Since her breakout album,
Dragging a Dead Deer up
a Hill, Grouper has grad-
ually shifted away from
reverb-loaded guitars and
synths, which stretched
like mist along an empty
field; instead, she has
begunusingamoreprecise
collage of piano, vocals,
and musique concrete – it
gives a greater sense of
immediacy, and hints at
the person behind the
project. The seven songs
on Group of Points form
a companion piece to her
2014 acclaimed album
Ruins, but remain a point
of departure.
Opening track, ‘The
Races’, which comes in
at under a minute, acts
like a signal of intent for
Grouper, setting the tone
for the rest of the album.
Multi-layered vocal tracks
create a choral blast of
sound, reminiscent of
work by fellow ambient
musician Julianna
Barwick. The remainder
of the songs, built around
pianos, place Grouper’s
vocals front and centre, in
hazy pieces that, though
experimental,remainopen
and accessible. Songs like
‘Blouse’, built around
slowly progressing chords
which slowly work their
way towards the sublime,
see Grouper’s vocals
bleeding over the top of a
piano base. ‘Parking Lot’
similarly sees Grouper
echoing alongside ghostly
pianos.
Grid of Points is
an album built around
negative space; silence
pervades the songs,
which are like fine
bolts of lace, defined by
absence. In tracks like
‘Birthday Song’, the
piano and vocals simply
fade away, a slight pause
demarcating phrases. In
‘Driving’, meanwhile,
which follows on from
the gradual dimming of
‘Parking Lot’, this silence
is broken by an unsteady
intake of breath, as if
Grouper is steeling herself
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN

Harris has described
her role in Grouper as
akin to a caretaker. In an
interview with Pitchfork,
she put it: “this music is
a room that I take care
of, I help decide what is
accepted. Here distortion
and mistakes, silence,
deep sadness, and mis-
understanding, they all
have a place.” Grid of
Points is an album that is
humanistic, generous, and
uplifting.
The recordings, which
were conducted in 2014 in
northern Wyoming, were
broken off after Grouper
fell ill; the music reflects
the cold snap that was
occurring outside at the
time, as well as the fever
that forced her to stop
recordings. Nevertheless,
the album, although short,
is a whole body of work.
In the last song, ‘Breath-
ing’, the vocals and piano
are cut across by a field
recording of a coal train
thundering by. But rather
than simply using it as
a punctum to close the
album, Grouper allows it
to linger for its entirety; as
the seconds, then minutes,
pass by, the listener appre-
ciates small details, which
– like much of Grouper’s
work – linger long after
the sound has faded away

GRID OF POINTS
American Dream: Dirty Computer is the truth Janelle
Monáe no longer wants to hide
Monáe steps out of Cindy Mayweather’s shadow in her most powerful album yet.
J
anelle Monáe
began her career by
adopting an android
alter-ego, Cindy
Mayweather. In singing
about oppression, forbid-
den love, and the struggle
to be free in Cindy’s guise,
she joined the tradition of
artists like Ann Leckie,
who see stories about
Artificial Intelligence
to be more than science
fiction fantasy divorced
from the world around us,
but rather as metaphors for
the lives of people who are
marginalised and do not
fit the mould of the rich,
cis, straight, white, and
male. Cindy, for Monáe,
was a way of speaking out
whilst keeping her listen-
ers at an arm’s length – we
were able to know about
Monáe’s feminism, her
politics, but not about her
true passions.
In the five years since
the release of her last
album, The Electric Lady,
Monáe has appeared
in the Oscar winning
Moonlight, about a young
black gay boy growing up
in Florida, and in Hidden
Figures, where she played
the first black woman in
America to gain a degree
from a white college
during the Jim Crow era.
In hindsight, these roles
seem like the prelude to
Dirty Computer, an album
that, at its heart, wants to
be a touchstone for people
who do not easily get
representation in main-
stream culture. With a
title that hints at the sexy,
subversive, and (emo-
tionally) compromised
songs that lie within, this
album is Monáe’s most
confessional. Finally, we
see Monáe step out of
Cindy’s shadow and share
her unfiltered self.
“The transformation
of silence into language”
wrote Audre Lorde “is an
act of self revelation”. Lis-
tening to Dirty Computer
is the act then of witness-
ing Monáe finding her
truest voice after so many
years of silence. We get
the sense that she has felt
burdened by her evasion:
“I don’t want to live on
my knees/I just want to
tell the truth” she declares
in ‘Crazy Classic Life’, a
smooth R&B track that
is louche and hedonistic
on the surface, but barbed
with emotional punch. It
isn’t hard to read between
the lines to figure out what
the truth that has been
haunting Monáe is: ques-
tions about her sexuality
have followed her since
her debut album. ‘Pynk’,
a collaboration with
Grimes, appears half way
through Dirty Computer
to lay the rumours to rest.
It is a blissed-out, airy,
funk celebration of the
female gaze and sapphic
desire, and about as
explicit as you could ask
for – in a fun, erotic, and
somehow rather touching
run of lyrics, Monáe
details all things pink:
tongues and vaginas, yes,
but also eyelids, brains,
hearts. The accompanying
video underscores the
queer vibes: in several
scenes Monáe sports a
pair of gloriously unsubtle
vulva trousers with Sol-
ange-like insouciance as
maybe-girlfriend Tessa
Thompson pokes her head
between the singer’s legs.
“Pink”, Monáe concludes,
“is the truth you can’t
hide.”
The exuberance of
‘Pynk’ is reflected in the
afro-beats stylings of ‘I
Got the Juice’, a track
featuring Pharell, the
synth heavy ‘Make Me
Feel’ which is suffused
with Prince’s influence,
and ‘I Like That’, an ode
to self love and resilience.
In other places, we see
Monáe the activist take
centre stage: in ‘Screwed’,
a sex-drenched pop
number featuring Zoë
Kravitz, Monáe offers
commentary on sex,
power, and inequalities.
The nihilism of ‘Screwed’
shows hints of an anger
that is refined and ampli-
fied in the magnificent
‘Django Jane’, a swag-
gering, braggadocious rap
distillation of her speech
at the Women’s March
in 2017. Referencing
everything from Pussy
Riot to Shonda Rhimes,
the feminist polemic ends
with the fantastically arch
line “let the vagina have a
monologue”.
Yet throughout, Monáe
circles back to truth-tell-
ing – its liberations and
the dangers that allowing
yourself to be visible
bring. In the opening
bars of ‘Don’t Judge Me’
Monáe’s voice is gravelly,
almost hoarse; raw in
a way that is entirely
disarming. “Even though
you say that you love me/
Is it me or do you love
my disguise?” she asks
us. Organ refrains weave
into the psychedelic-funk
cadences of the following
track, ‘So Afraid’, hinting
perhaps to Monáe’s
religious upbringing and
struggles to reconcile her
faith with her sexuality.
That the album’s bright
harmonies, purposeful
defiance, and joyful,
exhilarating guitar riffs
have this undercurrent
of melancholy makes
Dirty Computer perhaps
the most compelling and
true representation of a
coming out experience.
Monáe’s talent and bold
ambition has always set
her apart, her newest
album reveals a side of her
heretofore unseen. Rather
than the other-worldly
Cindy who kept the world
at bay, this is a woman
who, despite her fears, has
unflinchingly embraced
her truth, dared to be
visible as a black, queer
woman – a combination
that the world doesn’t
always welcome. Dirty
Computer is Monáe at her
most human, most vulner-
able, and most powerful;
it cements her as one of
music’s true icons.
