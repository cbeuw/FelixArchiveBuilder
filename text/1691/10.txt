Joe Hill-Gibbins takes us on a tour of hell
T
he National
T h e a t r e ’ s
production of
Absolute Hell,
Rodney King’s jet-black
dramedy set in Soho after
the Second World War,
begins by attempting to
prove Jean-Paul Sartre’s
adage that ‘hell is other
people’. The entire cast
– 28 people strong – line
themselves up along the
front of the Lyttelton
Theatre’s stage, barely
managing to all fit on,
before launching into an a
capella rendition of Édith
Piaf’s ‘La Vie en Rose’,
following which the
curtain rises on a salubri-
ous, battered drinking den
in the heart of London.
As the introduction
suggests, the play is most
certainly an ensemble
piece, with characters’
story arcs weaving and
threading over each other,
for better or worse. And
the cast isn’t the only jam-
packed thing about it – the
production clocks in at
around three hours, with
two breaks, and while
director Joe Hill-Gibbins
manages to make it seem
shorter, it maintains a
sense of bloat.
Hill-Gibbins’ decision
to keep things ticking
along rather rapidly,
making ample use of the
staging to create a frenetic
atmosphere, is an smart
one, presumably done
to make the stage seem
a bit like a spinning top,
liable to topple over at
any second. However,
what actually happens is
the characters can come
across as over-chore-
ographed, the mania
coming and going but
always somehow leaving
enough space for the main
action to play out.
Out of this fog of cig-
arette smoke and spilled
drinks, certain stand-out
characters emerge: the bar,
‘La Vie en Rose’, is run
by Christine Foskett (Kate
Fleetwood), who veers
from abrasive to humble,
blaring out drink orders
one minute and baring
her soul the next. She is
joined by Hugh Marriner,
a gay author who hasn’t
published any stories
for years, and spends his
nights getting drunk in La
Vie en Rose, surrounded
by fellow lost souls. They
are supported by a varied
coterie of grotesques and
GIs – Liza Sadovy is
wonderfully off-putting
as ‘The Treacle Queen’,
while Jonathan Slinger’s
sleazy film director
Maurice Hussey displays
a razor-slash of a smile as
his lecherous hands roam.
At the best of times,
the stage becomes like
a vast vision of hell, like
something by Hierony-
mus Bosch, with the huge
mirror to one side of the
set reflecting back the
action, slightly distorted
and incredibly menacing.
But these moments come
too few and far between.
There are several points
where the chaos breaches
through a fine veneer of
artifice, and the play feels
truly alive, like an Otto
Dix painting – the scene
at the end of the first act,
where masked GIs pour
into the bar is the most
chilling example – but for
the most part the action
always feels somewhat
constrained.
When Absolute Hell
– initially called The
Pink Room – was first
performed in 1952, it all
but sunk King’s career, as
critics lined up to discredit
it as tawdry and sordid.
It wasn’t performed
again for more than
three decades, and in the
interim relaxed censor-
ship laws allowed King
to rewrite certain parts of
it, making the references
to sexuality much more
overt. Unfortunately, in
the interim, he did little to
allow the characters to put
on a good show.
The script essentially
circles around the same
points again and again.
It’s presumably done in
order to highlight how
crippled the characters
are, trapped in their cycles
of loneliness and misery,
but it results in a severe
and bitter lack of devel-
opment, frustrating the
audience. We may under-
stand why the character
keep returning to La Vie
en Rose again and again,
but that doesn’t mean we
want to stay there any
longer than is necessary.
For a play that tests
the audience’s endurance
to succeed, it needs to be
able to capture their atten-
tion throughout. Absolute
Hell is epic in size, but
not, unfortunately, in
scope. While the themes
it throws up are precinct –
and all the more relevant
today, loneliness being an
eternally-modern malaise
– and the casting gen-
erally impressive, King
seems to be rehashing the
same points over and over
again. Part of the play’s
nature is in its bloated
structure, but one can’t
help but wish Hill-Gib-
bins had taken a bit of a
knife to the production,
leaving its most affecting
moments to gape open,
raw and bloody.
The stage is stalked,
during the majority of
the play, by a sex worker
walking the streets.
Always looking straight
ahead of her, with a dead-
eyed stare, she jangles
her keys in an attempt to
drum up trade, prowling
on the edge of the action.
She looks sinister, and
menacing, and – above
all – tired. By the time the
curtain comes down, I can
sympathise.
The National Theatre’s production of Rodney King’s bawdy mediation on isolation, Absolute Hell, has moments
of magic, but they are few and far between in the bloated structure.
