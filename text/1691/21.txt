Imperial forced to set up ‘recovery tent’ as returning
graduands suffer from PTSD-style symptoms

The College had
to seek medical
advice, as a record
number of students
began reliving PhD-
associated trauma at
graduation.

A
s postgradu-
ate graduation
got underway
earlier this
week, staff at Imperial
were forced to erect
a ‘recovery zone’ for
those suffering from
stress after returning to
campus.
College staff working
on postgraduate gradu-
ation, which took place
this Wednesday, cited
a number of reports of
graduands suffering from
anxiety attacks, fleeing
campus, and simply
lying on the ground and
screaming ‘no, no, don’t
make me go back.’ It is
believed these reactions
were generated by visitors
remembering traumatic
memories of their post-
graduate study, triggered
by visual cues on campus.
Staff were forced to co-
mindeer the refreshment
tent in order to establish a
‘recovery zone’, in which
traumatised graduands
and graduates could calm
down and receive profes-
sional support. Hangman
understands this area
consisted of large bean
bags, with soft lighting
and music, and volunteers
telling the students ‘you
never have to go back to
that lab again, you’re safe
now’ in hushed tones.
Dr Katie Blentham, a
consultant psychiatrist at
Charing Cross Hospital
who was drafted in by
the College to help them
prepare for graduation,
told Hangman: “the reac-
tions we see in those who
have recently left Imperial
after completing a PhD are
similar to the symptoms
of Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) experi-
enced by those in conflict
zones. These students
will typically experience
a heightened reaction
to noise, sensations of
anxiety, and a desire to
avoid areas of stress, such
as the toilet on the second
floor of RSM where they
with a doctorate in geo-
physics, told Hangman
about her experience: “I
wasreallylookingforward
to having a wonderful day
after four years of hard
work. However, as soon
as I arrived on campus
and saw Central Library,
I began to feel really ill.
I spotted my supervisor
across the Quad, and he
came to greet my family.
I suddenly had a flashback
to the time he’d been so
mean about my lab results
I wet myself, and col-
lapsed. I don’t remember
much of what happened
afterwards, but when I
came to in the tent my
mother told me I’d tried to
attack my supervisor, and
was screaming something
about them never being
able to take me alive.”
Will Hanley, Vice
Knees weak, palms sweaty // Imperial College
Provost (Pop Psycholo-
gy), told Hangman the
College had plans to
move the ceremony next
year. “While we feel the
graduation ceremony this
year went very well,”
he told Hangman, “the
College is looking into
alternative venues, with
less of a lived history of
trauma and stress. We’d
like to also take this
opportunity to remind our
recent graduates that the
generosity of our alumni
allows us to support some
of our neediest students,
so if you’re planning of
practicing philanthropy,
please do keep us in your
thoughts… or don’t…
whichever you find less
traumatising.”
“Dr Blentham,
a consultant
psychiatrist,
said the
episodes could
be set off by
exposure to
triggers, such
as walking
past the toilet
you spent your
PhD crying in”
would go to cry when it
all got too much.”

If a student hands in
their dissertation, and
doesn’t take a photo
of it, was it ever really
handed in?
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
S
everal students
have failed their
d i s s e r t a t i o n s
after failing to
post a photograph of
them handing it in on
social media.
A number of final-year
physics students, who
handed in their final
project reports earlier
in the week, yesterday
morning received an
email from the head of de-
partment informing them
their “failure to accurately
document the moment on
social media” had meant
they would “be given a
lower mark, in line with
our new educational
policy.”
Harold Bash, one of
the students affected, who
has now dropped from
a high 2:1 to a low 2:2
said he thought the rules
were “unfair”: “I worked
incredibly hard on my
project, pulling several
all-nighters the weekend
before it was due. I think
to expect me to document
this moment – when I’m
pale from lack of sun
exposure, sweaty from an
overdose of caffeine, and
greasy from a diet con-
sisting solely of Fusion
and Library Cafe jacket
potatoes – is border-
line-sadistic.”
course it’s a fair rule” one
student told Hangman, “If
I hand in my dissertation,
and nobody is around to
like my Facebook post
about it, did it ever really
happen? I don’t know, I’m
not a philosopher.”
Paul Killey, Vice
Provost (Humblebrag-
ging), spoke to Hangman
about the policy changes:
“The changes on hand-in
rules have been put in
place as part of our new
Learning and Teaching
Strategy. Starting in de-
partments in the Faculty
of Natural Science, and
then moving out to other
faculties, we will now
no longer be accepting
dissertations without
photographic evidence
of the actual hand-in on
social media. Of course,
students have always been
present for the handover
process in the past, but
we felt they hadn’t really
been present – you know
what I mean?”
He also said the new
rules would “create a
sense of community
among the students under-
taking final projects”, and
“maybe encourage them
to go and take a goddamn
shower before they hand
in the work.”

This week you realise
you’ve managed to
sample every single
baked good on offer at
Imperial. Your life is now
hollow and meaningless.
This week you’re
working in Central
Library and pop down
to the Cafe for a coffee.
When you get back
someone has thrown
your stuff in the bin and
claimed the desk as their
own. Them’s the rules.
This week you head
back to Imperial for
graduation, and take
on the appearance of a
drowned rat. It’s for the
best – nobody can see
your tears in the rain.
This week you hand in
your final year project,
and wait for the crushing
feeling of doom to finally
lift. It doesn’t. Turns out
you’re just depressed.
This week you want to
have an opinion on the
Windrush scandal, but it
happened during revision
time, and too much has
happened for you to catch
up with it. Best wait until
the next government
fuck-up.
This week, taking
inspiration from Amber
Rudd, you decide to be
completely incompetent
at everything you do in
the hopes it will pay off.
It does! You’re made the
new Home Secretary.
This week you have
your first exam you get
through without crying
and wetting yourself!
This time you only cry!
Go you!
This week you’re so
pleased you were able to
exercise your democratic
rights and vote in the
local elec… oh fuck
you’ve missed them
haven’t you.
This week you try and
put “complete heartbreak
over Kanye’s tweets” as
a reason for mitigating
circumstances. It
succeeds, surprisingly.
This week you
procrastinate by
becoming emotionally
involved with a detached,
‘does he like me or
not’ guy. Don’t worry.
Once exams are finished
you’ll realise he’s not
mysterious, he’s just a
cunt.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
you’re emailed by your
personal tutor about your
“concerningly bitter
horoscopes” – this is how
I FEEL don’t judge me.

said‘failure
to accurately

hand-in on
social media
will result in a
lower mark’”

however, felt the new rules
were appropriate: “Of
