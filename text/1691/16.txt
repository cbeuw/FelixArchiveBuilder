A wrong, mostly short history of punk rock, part III
Hank finally got his shit together sufficiently to write the third and final installment of Felix Music’s history of the
nittiest, grittiest genre that’s ever graced a recording booth. Unfortunately, he still can’t write consistent titles.
T
o all of my
readers waiting
for this a month
ago – sorry, the
end of term got messy,
and I never finished the
article. Not that you (as
in, my readers) exist, I just
thought I’d take the op-
portunity to flatter myself.
Now, on to history.
Despite all the over-ea-
ger commenters through-
out the years claiming
that ‘punk is dead,’ it
never went away. To this
day, you can find thriving
scenes from the gutters
of Jakarta to here in
central London. The basic
tenets – the disrespect for
established customs, the
aggression and frenetic
energy, and the do-it-
yourself ethic – have all
inextricably manifested
themselves in contempo-
rary music.
But such abstract
concepts associated with
punk rock, nowadays,
are by-and-large
divorced from the Punk
Rock Sound of old. For
example: drumlines. His-
torically, punk’s always
preferred minimal com-
plexity, maximal energy;
hit the snare a square
four times per bar and be
done with it. When there
were variations, they were
distilled and rehashed; for
example, D-beat (named
after the band Discharge)
is a relatively tricky fill for
the untrained drummer,
but they play the same
fill at the same tempo for
albums at a time. That
subgenre, by the way, is
predictably called D-beat.
Over such a
long time, though, these
sorts of approaches have
faded away; the no-rules
approach holds for punk
rock itself ultimately, and
it is this very trait that
allows the punk rock ethos
to recycle itself and stay
relevant across decades.
Punk’s not dead, it’s just
in hiding.
This is the point at
which modern punk
diverges, in terms of com-
position, timbral palette,
thematic approach, and
so on; punk lives on, as
a set of ideals, versus a
particular music scene.
The landscape of
modern punk is quite
scattered. Many of the old
giants are still around; you
can still go see shows for
Bad Religion, NOFX, The
Descendents, Bad Brains,
and so on. Quite a few,
naturally, have broken
up; sometimes, though,
they reformed(ish). For
example, Op Ivy called
it quits before their first
album even dropped, but
Tim Armstrong and Matt
Freeman then formed
Rancid in ‘91, and they’re
still going.And Streetlight
Manifesto and Propagan-
dhi are still sticking out
great stuff (if you can call
the pace Streetlight works
at “active”).
Then there’s pop
punk, a (some would
call unfortunate) genre
blending emo, pop, and
something approximating
a punk rock sound. There
are too many bands to
count; some big ones are
Rise Against, Yellowcard,
Search the City, and so on.
The largest acts are un-
doubtably Paramore, Fall
Out Boy, and Green Day.
They’re labeled as “punk”
because many emerged
from the punk scene –
Green Day was big in
the 80s and 90s, and their
first major-label effort
Dookie is a classic album.
Likewise, Pete Wentz of
Jeffrey Lewis. The fusion
is marked by acoustic,
eclectic instrumentation;
usually horns, a double
bass, and an acoustic
guitar that sounds like
someone beat the shit out
of it before they picked it
up and started strumming
as fast and hard as they
could.
have sought to recreate
Springsteen. It’s a whole
new generation of Amer-
icana, and it sounds fan-
tastic; The ‘59 Sound and
Handwritten are absolute
essentials.
Bands have also
followed in Joy Division
and New Order’s foot-
steps; Protomartyr comes
to mind as an example
of what I might call Rust
Belt wheeze-punk, with
songs that sound like the
urban decay they were
born in.
Queercore and Riot
Grrrl are genres that came
out of the LGBTQ+ and
feminist movements; in
the former, there are bands
like the Violent Femmes
and Pansy Division, while
the latter gave birth to the
headline-grabbing Pussy
Riot – famously jailed for
protesting Putin. I should
note here that while
punk has a reputation for
machismo, the space is
quite open and accepting;
most punks at shows have
fairly far-left political
views. It’s really funny
watching some dude on
stage scream about how
their shows should be a
safe space – not to dis-
courage the moshers, just
to make sure individuals
who belong to minority
groups feel welcome.
And that, at the end of
the day, is what defines
punk rock for me. It’s not
just about the music – it’s
about getting up on stage,
making as much noise as
possible, and building a
community rooted in that
special kind of catharsis
that belongs uniquely and
totally to punk rock.
And that’s the allure;
the camaraderie, the inten-
sity, the crowdsurfing and
moshing – it all builds up
to something much greater
than the sum of its parts,
a vibrant and vivacious
mish-mash that stands as
testament to individuality
and community, to good
times and bad, to the full
palette of human emotion.
Few genres have made
such an impression on
me. Punk rock will always
have a place in my heart.

Fall Out Boy got his start
in Racetraitor, playing
the Chicago scene while
it thrived (where he often
shared the stage with Tim
from Rise Against). It’s a
shame how they disinte-
grated – now they make
major-label electro-pop
and sound blander than
ever.
There are fusion
genres, too. Bands like
Slowdive and Godspeed
You! Black Emperor
inherited quite a bit from
the DIY ethic, but turn
the tempo down waaaay
low; the latter lives in
a commune in Quebec,
where they have their
studio. Hip-hop caught a
major wave as well, with
artists like Danny Brown
and Death Grips being
prime examples.
Folk-punk was kick-
started by the Violent
Femmes; the genre has
snowballed in modern
times. Recent successes
include Andrew Jackson
Jihad, Days’n’Daze,
Johnny Hobo and the
Freight Trains, and
“Punk rock
stands as
testament to
the full palette
of human
emotion.”
Grindcore is a joke
genre. The verses are
usually incomprehensible
noise. Anal Cunt comes
to mind – with songs like
‘I Went Back in Time and
Voted For Hitler’ and ‘I
Lit Your Baby On Fire’
counting among their
least offensive songs.
