Graduation is a waste of money, and we’re
all going to die anyway
Grumpy Bastard, our resident contrarian, sets his sights on the graduation ceremony.

T
his week all of
the gormless
morons who
managed to make
it through the whole of
an Imperial postgraduate
course graduated. As I
looked through the crowd
of students desperately
navigating their parents
and loved ones to the
ceremony, to be seated
nowhere near one another,
it struck me that all of
their faces bore the same
expression: relief. I think
that probably sums up the
Imperial experience that
we were all mis-sold when
filling out the UCAS form
all that time ago. Thank
fuck it’s over.
The weather really went
for exactly the same thing
as well. Not dramatic rain,
just a persistent drizzle to
make all the photos look
foreboding and miserable,
a further reminder of the
true Imperial experience.
I unfortunately had to
come in on the day of
graduation and everyone
was using umbrellas,
possibly the most lethal
tool a small-statured
pedestrian can possess
short of an RPG-7. I
assume that people use
umbrellas to protect their
expensive outfits, hat, and
hair from the onslaught
of said light drizzle, but
is that worth the cost
of someone else having
to perform an inelegant
ballet to navigate through
the crowds? There must
be a better way to protect
one’s garments from the
rain without causing in-
convenience to everyone
else. Possibly some kind
of rigid head condom. I’ll
have a chat with Des Eng,
give them something to do
other than eating rubbers
and shoving pencil leads
up their noses.
All of this just to
protect the gowns they
make you hire for the
ceremony, atop whatever
fancy clothes that people
have chosen to wear. The
graduation ceremony as a
whole is an over-expen-
sive opportunity to get
a handshake from Alice
Gast. It’s highly likely that
the whole expense of the
event just about covers the
cost of her time to shake
all of your grubby hands
and pretend that this is
anything special to her,
before the next trainload
of gullible money cows
arrives in October.
Don’t get me wrong,
I’m sure the graduation
ceremony is extremely
meaningful to some
people and it is a celebra-
tion of your achievement
at university. I just wish
it wasn’t so expensive
given that the faculty
have essentially admitted
that the tuition fees only
cover the cost of the piece
of paper they present at
the end. Personally I’d
prefer it if they stuck to
the tie honoured tradition
of workplace leaving
dos: not-memorable and
regretting it the morning
after, but at least it comes
with a free mug.
Grumpy Bastard
extends their congratula-
tions to those graduating
and wishes them well
for the next 40 years of
drudgery before their
inevitable descent into
chronic illness and death.
