Universities minister promises to crack-down on no-
platforming with first interventions in 30 years
NEWS
Sam Gyimah called
for clarification over
policy on free speech
at university, as
debates over extent of
the problem continue.
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
U
n i v e r s i t i e s
Minister Sam
Gyimah this
week prom-
ised to crack down on
the “institutional hostil-
ity” of safe-space and
no-platform policies,
with the first govern-
ment interventions on
the issue in 30 years.
At a closed-door free
speech summit chaired by
Gyimah on Thursday 3rd
May, the minister called
for clarification over
guidance offered in the
higher educational sector,
and said the government
will work with university
to “provide clarity of the
rules for both students and
universities.”
Gyimah said preventing
people speaking at univer-
sity campuses due to their
views was “chilling”, and
said new guidance should
“prevent bureaucrats
or wreckers on campus
from exploiting gaps for
their own ends.” He said:
“There is a risk that over-
zealous interpretation of a
dizzying variety of rules is
acting as a brake on legal
free speech on campus.”
The summit, which was
held in London, brought
together a number of or-
ganisations, including the
Charity Commission and
Universities UK (UUK).
The Department of Educa-
tion has not offered more
information on what the
content of the guidelines
would be, only that they
would “provide clarity of
the rules for both students
and universities.”
This will be the first
government intervention
into freedom of speech
on campuses for more
than three decades. The
last such intervention
was the free speech duty,
introduced in 1986, which
stated universities had a
responsibility to protect
freedom of speech within
the law.
This announcement
indicates Gyimah will be
following in the footsteps
of his predecessor Jo
Johnson in focussing on
the issue of free speech.
Gyimah wrote in The
Times this week that he
had “fallen foul of cen-
sorship” due to “unseen
and pernicious tentacles
of bureaucracy” when
he visited a university
campus.
Government is pandering
to its base about ‘attacks
on free speech’, here at
Imperial College Union
we are working with our
members on real risks to
students’ education and
wellbeing. In the last few
weeks alone, we have
lobbied College to refund
students for teaching
missed due to strikes,
work on a student support
strategy, and follow our
recommendations to
improve the Imperial
Bursary to widen access
to Imperial.”
“We invite Mr Gyimah,
and the other politicians
and commentators who
have conjured up this false
narrative about students,
to leave the safe spaces
of their offices and online
echo chambers and come
to Beit Quad to learn what
student leaders are really
doing and how they can
help improve our students’
university experience.”
In recent years there
have been a number of
high-profile controversies
over visiting speakers to
UK universities: in 2015,
ManchesterStudentUnion
refused to grant alt-right
figurehead Milo Yiannop-
oulos the right to speak,
saying his views would
incite hatred against trans
students, while King’s
College London had to
be evacuated in March
after protesters stormed a
talk by Carl Benjamin, a
controversial British You-
Tuber who makes videos
under the name Sargon of
Akkad. Benjamin has fre-
quently been described as
a member of the alt-right,
a label he rejects.
A number of media
outlets have directed at-
tention towards the policy
of ‘no-platforming’, in
which individuals are
denied the right to speak
on university campuses.
The National Union of
Students’ (NUS) No
Platform Policy, prevents
individuals or groups with
racist or fascist views
from speaking at NUS
events. Six organisations
fall under the policy,
including the British Na-
tional Party and English
Defence League.
equality and diversity.
The debate over
whether or not universities
in the UK are hostile to
free speech is an ongoing
one. The UK Parliament’s
Joint Committee on
Human Rights published
a report on free speech
at universities earlier this
year, stating “the extent
to which students restrict
free speech at universities
should not be exagger-
ated.” The report stated
it was “not a pervasive
problem,” but identified
university and student
union policy could present
a barrier to free speech.
TheSpikedFreeSpeech
University Rankings this
year stated over half the
UK universities surveyed
had “actively censored
ideas on campus”; the ma-
jority of policies the group
singled out as suppressing
freedom of speech were
about preventing harass-
ment, discrimination, or
transphobia in the work-
place. Commentators
have called these rankings
a “misrepresentation of
freedom of debate on
British campuses”, and
said Spiked were “hand-
maidens of the alt-right”.
Alistair Jarvis, UUK’s
Chief Executive, said:
“Universities are com-
mitted to promoting and
protecting free speech
within the law…a small
number of flash points
do occasionally occur, on
contentious or controver-
sial issues, but universities
do all they can to protect
free speech so events can
continue.”
Gordon Marsden, the
shadow higher education
minister, criticised the
closed-doors nature of the
summit, and described the
announcement as “simply
another piece of meaning-
less posturing from the
government, while it has
nothing practical to offer
students dealing with
record levels of debt.”

The move is the latest
in a series of government
statements on free speech
on campus. At the end of
last year, Johnson said the
Office for Students (OfS),
which came into force on
April 1st
, would have the
power to fine universities
that failed to protect free
speech.
