How do we mend the rift between science and art?
Aesop’s Arts in Health Conference and Showcase demonstrates how people are working to bring the worlds
together, but also shows how far we still have to go.

I
am slightly ashamed
to admit that after
four years at Imperial,
I had yet to attend
a single conference.
However, in the spirit of
trying new things and
expanding my horizons,
I agreed to accompany
my friend to Aesop’s Arts
in Health Conference
and Showcase. This
neophiliac mentality was
what drove me to choose
Humanities, Philosophy
and Law (HPL) and
Computational Medicine
as my BSc options – basi-
cally anything that wasn’t
clinical Medicine. Of
course, taking risks like
these could end up either
way – through HPL, I’ve
discovered a new passion
for the arts whereas
through Computational
Medicine, I’ve discovered
my pathological inability
to write working code and
a near fatal allergy to da-
ta-frames. Nevertheless,
I was hoping that this
conference would be the
perfect end to my year of
experimenting, and the
event was finally sold to
me under the promise
of free food and Dame
Darcey Bussell DBE of
Strictly Come Dancing
fame.
Then April 19th
rolled
around and, on the most
glorious day of the year
so far, the decision to
spend the whole day
indoors being lectured
at didn’t seem like such
a great idea anymore.
Nevertheless, we dutifully
trooped in, fixing our
swanky PRESS – Imperial
College London badges to
our chests and strapped
ourselves in for the eight-
hour education tour-de-
force.
After a rousing opening
speech by science writer
and broadcaster, Vivienne
Parry OBE, the main
questions of the day were
posed:
“What is the role of
an artist in 21st
century
society and how can one
achieve artistic citizen-
ship?” and “How can art
be utilised to transform a
negative health image to a
positive artistic one?”
Compelling questions
for sure, but not the ones
I was seeking answers to.
What I wanted to know
was when we’d see the
legendary Dame Darcey
Bussell, principal dancer
of the Royal Ballet at
the tender age of 20, and
whether or not she actually
floated, as rumours would
have you believe.
“Dance for
Parkinson’s
shows dance
as a positive
intervention
that improves
stability”
“I couldn’t help
but notice an
undercurrent
of fear beneath
the positivity”
The rest of the day
was split into showcases,
panel discussions, and
plenary activities with
organisations explaining
their projects and demon-
strating various health
benefits. These projects
ranged from Melodies
for Mums, group singing
sessions showing prom-
ising signs of preventing
and abating post-natal de-
pression, to The Reader,
shared-reading groups
attempting to tackle in-
creasing social isolation
across the country. A
personal favourite was
Dance for Parkinson’s,
a collaboration with the
English National Ballet,
whose promotional video
was a giddying montage
of elderly chair-dancing
and asymmetric legwear
sported by the ballet
troupe. Not only is dance
a positive intervention
that improves posture,
stability, and fluidity
of movement, but one
patient also described its
benefits as “a new sense
of freedom, a coping
mechanism”.
On the clinician side
of the health experience,
projects such as Perform-
ing Medicine by the Clod
Ensemble attempted to
teach health workers and
medical students how
to act human again – a
regrettably much-needed
programme in the current
clinical environment. As a
medical student myself, I
am often wary of accusa-
tions that new generations
of health workers were
increasingly cold and
distanced from the people
they were trying to treat.
However, as one speaker
put it, “Feeling caring
isn’t enough”. Blame it on
the prescriptive nature of
the clinical encounter, the
tick-box feel of ICE-ing
(asking about ideas,
concerns, and expecta-
tions), or time constraints
imposed on health
workers, but the actual
demonstration of caring
is now often left as an
afterthought, regardless
of how clinicians actually
feel.
Midway through the
day, we were treated to a
workshop with Patsy Ro-
denburg, Professor of Text
and Poetry, and world
expert on teaching voice,
speech, and presentation
skills. What started as a
description of the power
of ‘presence’ for healing
and everyday life culmi-
nated in a cultish session
of breathing exercises and
pair-bonding activities.
Despite the atmosphere
of religious reverence,
I couldn’t help but feel
a little sceptical of the
promised benefits of
breathing to people (not
beyond, and not before).
Perhaps it was because
of my sceptical nature, I
couldn’t help but notice
an undercurrent of fear
beneath the praise and
positivity throughout the
day. Fear for funding,
understandably, but also
a fear of the medical
community. The question
most often raised was how
to do an RCT (randomised
control trial) and every
mention of the initialism
sent shiver through the
crowds. This, along with
the collective eye-rolling
at the mention of evi-
dence-based medicine left
me slightly worried about
the medicine-arts divide.
Was the rift really that ir-
reconcilable? And whose
job was it to bring these
two disciplines together?
In this event, it felt like
a battle for dominance
between science and
art – social interventions
were declared “better than
drugs” and social health
was emphasised while bi-
ological health was often
side-lined. I don’t wish to
detract from the impor-
tance of social aspects of
health, and these projects
are all genuinely exciting
regardless of what domain
you work in, but what
was needed – a common
language translating
between arts and science,
between ‘soft’ therapies
and clinical outcomes –
was sorely lacking from
an event that sought to
marry the two worlds.
We left slightly early
to catch the last ray of
summer sun. After all, I
didn’t want to wait another
year before it graced us
again with its presence.
Unfortunately, this meant
I never got to see Darcey
Bussell, patron of fourteen
charities and committed
dance advocate. Maybe
I’ll never know if her skin
really glows in the dark, as
it does in my imagination,
or whether she chooses
to enter every room with
a pirouette. Either way, I
was glad I decided to go,
if only to see the asym-
metric legwear.
