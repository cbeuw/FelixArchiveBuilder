ICXCAC head to the LUCA outdoors competition
T
he sun was
shining, and
despite the early
start for many,
the ICXCAC team was
smiling. Why? It was time
for the LUCA (London
Universities and Colleges
Athletics) outdoors ath-
letics series, beginning at
Parliament Hill athletics
track. On 15th
April, the
first meeting kicked off,
with competitors from all
across London battling
to top the points table
going into the second
event of the series. The
complete range of events
was on offer, from steeple
chase to javelin, and this
event provided a perfect
opportunity for the many
first-timers to get intro-
duced to the sport.
By 9am, we had
planted the Imperial flag
and the team was all set
to over-enthusiastically
cheer on their fellow
competitors. The day
began with the signature
event of this meet, the
10,000m, followed by
the 1500m. ICXCAC
excellent performance too
from Helena Dona in the
women’s race. Following
on from this, Imperial was
strongly represented in the
400m, with four competi-
tors including Athletics’
Captain Max Thorp. Great
performances followed by
ex-captain Raul Rinken
in javelin, shot put and
discus throw, with him
winning the javelin event.
Other successes of
the day included another
win by James Millett in
the 800m and by Oliver
Newton in the steeple
chase (think 3000m but
with hurdles and puddles).
A special mention too
for Club Captain Alex
Mundell who bagged a
massive 22 points for the
team across her many
events.Thehighlightofthe
day was the 5000m, with
four athletes entered from
Imperial, purely because
of the sheer quality of
the chants generated by
the Imperial cheer squad
(video evidence can be
supplied). There could
be no doubting our team
spirit, especially given our
latest innovation of Impe-
rial-brand transfer tattoos
– although this did lead to
many weird looks on the
tube ride back (possibly
due to them being on our
foreheads…).
So, all in all, another
great event! The first of
the series finished with
Imperial in 3rd
place in
the points table behind
King’s and UCL, but it
is all to play for with two
more events to come. The
bigger the team, the more
points we can win so if
you’ve ever been tempted
to give athletics a try,
now is your chance! This
incredibly casual event
offers you the perfect op-
portunity to unleash your
inner athlete (and help
beat UCL in the process).
In joining ICXCAC you
not only get the chance
to take part in this great
competition, but you get
to be part of one of the
best clubs in Imperial. So
why wait?
