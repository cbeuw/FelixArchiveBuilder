Several students
contacted Felix
this week reporting
overflowing sanitary
bins, blood on floors
and walls, and out of
order facilities.

A
number of
students have
recently raised
concerns over
the cleanliness and
upkeep of the toilet fa-
cilities at Imperial.
Several students this
week spoke to Felix over
the state of the bath-
rooms around campus,
regarding changes to the
course as “confrontational
and unapologetic,” while
another student said
“much of the communica-
tion from the department
feels like we’re an incon-
venience.” One student
told Felix: “Any time I
see an email from the de-
partment in my inbox, I’m
immediately on edge…the
passive aggressive attitude
contributes to making
the whole department a
hostile environment.”
As well as issues with
communication, students
reported problems with
accessing past papers, lack
of clarity over marking
and feedback, and the
lack of a community of
students. One student said
they thought things would
improve, but “the culture
is still quite unhealthy.
Competition is kinda
Students describe physics as "a hostile environment"
implicitly encouraged to
a pathological level, and
that really kills any kind
of community vibe."
One Physics student
told Felix: "In the physics
department there is one
rule: student opinion
comes second. It’s stupid,
since giving our opinions
can help develop a better
course/ experience for
everybody. My only hope
for student satisfaction to
rise in the future is that
we have a new amazing
head of department who
actually listens to us, as
well as the upcoming
curriculum – God knows
how, but they realised
having student input on
that would be useful. It is
a true nightmare to make
changes to the Physics
department."
The Department of
Physics has put a number
of changes in place to
address the satisfaction
rates, an Imperial College
spokesperson told Felix:
“The department
recently appointed a
student liaison officer in
order to be able to provide
more support to students,
and has been carrying
out student satisfaction
surveys as well as drop-in
sessions to allow students
to raise concerns and
voice their views. The
Department has also been
working to strengthen
the personal tutor system
and has started new
initiatives to improve
assessment feedback
timeliness. Other initia-
tives to support students
include efforts to boost
mental health awareness
across the Department,
working with charities
Mind and Student Minds
to develop a network of
trained student facilitators
who can help signpost
others to support”
The CUG described
Imperial as “a great
choice for studying
Physics”, saying its “high
Entry Standards, strong
Research Quality, and
impressive Graduate
Prospects…more than
make up for a relatively
low Student Satisfaction.”
An Imperial College
London spokesperson told
Felix: “Imperial College
London is committed to
offering all of its students
a world-leading, rigorous,
evidence-based, inclusive
educational experience as
part of a vibrant research
environment. The College
is embarking on a radical
transformation of the way
it educates by applying
new teaching methods
that enrich the student
experience and improve
inclusion and diversity.
We will be working with
students at every opportu-
nity to get feedback, as we
understand that we need
this evidence base if we
are to offer students the
very best in teaching and
support services.”

particularly those in
Central Library. Students
reported having to use
bathrooms with blood
on the walls and floor,
overflowing sanitary
bins, and used sanitary
products on the floor and
toilet seats. Felix was sent
photographic evidence of
bloodied tampons on the
floor of toilet cubicles in
the women’s bathrooms in
Central Library.
One student told Felix
overflowing sanitary bins
“causes many problems,
since when you’re on your
period and need to change
towels or tampons, there’s
often nowhere to put the
old ones. The bins are
not small, and given the
fact they seem to be in a
permanent state of over-
flow, it makes you wonder
how often they really are
emptied. It is horribly
unsanitary, and seems to
be a problem specific to
the Library.”
Further issues were
raised with out of order
facilities, with students re-
porting closure of several
of the men’s bathrooms in
Central Library this week
due to “essential repairs
and servicing”. Students
also reported equipment
in toilet cubicles falling
off the wall and injuring
them.
One student told Felix:
“The Level 5 urinals have
been flooding and spilling
out over the floor. Today
the whole bathroom was
marked out of order, as
were the ground floor
toilets, making the ones
that remained operational
considerably busier. It’s
just one more thing for us
to worry about on top of
the impending exams.”
These problems come
at a particularly busy
time for Central Library,
as many undergraduate
students prepare for up-
coming examinations.
A spokesperson for
Imperial College London
said: “Library Services
constantly reviews the
cleaning of our facilities
and works with the
cleaning team to continue
to make improvements.
In recent months adjust-
ments have been made to
the cleaning programme
for Library Services
and we will continue to
review these plans and
make amendments as ap-
propriate during the busy
revision period”.
Central Library is
currently in the middle
on an ongoing renovation
project, which aims to
bring about long-awaited
improvements in tem-
perature control. The
first phase of the project,
which saw Levels 4 and 5
closed for several months,
was completed earlier this
academic year.

Students raise concerns over Central Library toilets
Imperial ranked most innovative
university in the UK
Imperial has retained 2nd
place in Reuters’
ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative
Universities for the third year in a row. Only KU
Leuven, Belgium, was ranked higher.
The ranking is based on the number of
patents filed and granted, as well as how often
basic research from an institution influences
commercial R&D activity. Imperial received
a score of 36.8 against 40.7 for KU Leven and
32.7 for Cambridge, who came 3rd
.
Overall, the Reuters ranking has shown
many UK universities have dropped this
year, with continental institutions, largely
in Germany, advancing their positions. This
comes amid the continued uncertainty over
the implementation of Brexit, with academics
seeing the E.U. or the USA as better for career
prospects.
Speaking last year, Professor Alice Gast, said
she was “very concerned” about uncertainties
regarding Brexit.

Graduation 2.0
I
was originally going
to write this editorial
to encourage people
to go out and vote in
their local elections. I had
a whole diatribe planned,
where I would outline why
democracy was so impor-
tant, how vital it is for the
government to listen to the
voices of younger voters,
and the inspirational men
and women who have
campaigned for universal
suffrage. Trust me, it was
going to be great. Pulitzer
Prize to the usual address,
etc.
Unfortunately,Irealised
that – while I might write
this column while the
polls are still open – this
issue is going to published
long after voting is all
over, and the dust has
settled. So instead you’re
going to have to read what
you read every week:
a poorly-thought out,
barely readable stream of
consciousness, powered
by the twin engines of a
looming deadline and a
desire to just go home and
sleep. Enjoy.
This week has, for
me, seen cause for both
celebration and conster-
nation. This Wednesday
was the postgraduate
graduation ceremony (no
matter how many times
I say it, it still sounds
clunky) – hundreds of
students who had finished
masters degrees or PhDs
came back to Imperial,
black cloaks flapping in
the wind and rain, sur-
rounded by proud family
members jostling for
prime photo-opportunity
position outside the Royal
Albert Hall. I always
rather enjoy graduation
days – not because of the
actual ceremony itself, but
rather because the sight of
the proud graduands/grad-
uates (I don’t care about
the difference, don’t @
me) is pretty wholesome,
and makes it seem like the
experience so many of us
go through will be worth
it in the end.
And this brings us
onto a less pleasant point:
last week, the Complete
University Guide released
their UK league tables, in
which Imperial climbed a
rank to 4th
in the country.
However, one metric
where Imperial fell down
compared to other univer-
sities was in the student
satisfaction portion of the
rankings. Some depart-
ments, in particular, had
great scores for research
quality or job prospects,
but pretty dire ones for
how happy their students
were.
The Department of
Physics, in particular, had
low student satisfaction
scores. This isn’t a new
problem: the satisfaction
rates have been slowly
dropping over the past
few years, with National
Student Survey responses
highlightingconcernsover
assessment, feedback, and
the lack of a sense of com-
munity. To get a better
idea of what the problems
were in the department,
I went to the voices
that really matter – the
students. They described
a ‘hostile environment’,
where undergraduates all
too often feel like a low
priority in comparison to
the research that goes on
around them.
The department is
doing things to try and
fix this, and it should
be welcomed, but it
reflects a general issue
over the stress many
students go through to
get an Imperial degree.
One student I spoke to
said they’d regretted the
amount of stress they’d
put themselves under, and
how it had numbed them
to constant pressure. So
despite the joyful faces of
students at graduation, I
still have to wonder: is it
all worth it?
