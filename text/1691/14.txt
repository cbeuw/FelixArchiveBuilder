T
he death of Islam
Karimov, the
dictatorial leader
of Uzbekistan,
nearly two years ago,
dropped the country into
a quagmire of uncertainty.
The leader, who had held
power for 27 years, was
widely criticised for his
use of torture, crackdown
on press freedoms, and a
2005 massacre in which
around 400 protesters
were killed. In a turn of
events that seems right out
of a postmodern satire, the
news of his ill-health was
announced on his daugh-
ter’s Instagram account.
Out of this chaos
and turmoil, the Uzbek
novelist Hamid Ismailov,
who was forced to flee
Uzbekistan in 1992 for
Britain, had his first Uz-
bek-language novel pub-
lished in the Central Asian
nation in 25. Literature,
like life, finds a way.
The novel that was
published, The Devil’s
Dance, now finds its
way into English-read-
ers hands, thanks to a
translation from Donald
Rayfield, printed by
publishers Tilted Axis.
Rayfield, working closely
with Ismailov and fellow
translator John Farndon,
has produced a moving
translation that flows
beautifully, while retain-
ing a number of stylistic
and structural elements
that could make the trans-
lation difficult.
The Devil’s Dance
reads something like a
cross between classical
Central Asian poetry and
a postmodern deconstruc-
tion of the function of the
novel. The story primarily
centres around the life
of Abdulla Qodiriy,
perhaps the most popular
Uzbek novelist of the
20th century, although
little-known in the West.
Opening with Qodiriy
tending to his garden,
suffused with the idea for
a novel that “would be a
terrific story, surpassing
both Past Days and The
Scorpion from the Altar”,
he is quickly arrested by
the Soviet secret police,
as part of Stalin’s Great
Purge. Ismailov imme-
diately plunges us into a
world of political prison-
ers and jail cells, intrigue
and horror.
Within this framework,
Ismailov takes us inside
the mind of Qodiriy as he
struggles to conceive of
the uncompleted novel –
Emir Umar’s Slave Girl –
and try and finish it within
the cold walls of his cell.
This secondary novel, set
during the ‘Great Game’of
the 19th century, in which
English and Russian spies
wormed their way into the
royal courts of Central
Asia, centres around
Oyxon – a poet and
queen, passed from ruler
to ruler, trapped within the
confines of palaces. It’s a
more palatial setting that
Qodiriy’s, but it’s still a
prison.
Ismailov plunges
us deep into a world
of double-crossing,
poetry-spouting royalty,
introducing a retinue of
historical figures, such
as Nasrullah, the ruler
of Bukhara, Emir Umar,
the leader of Kokland,
and Nodira, his beautiful
wife, and one of the most
acclaimed Uzbek poets of
the age.
Qodiriy develops a
deep identification with
Oyxon, whose predica-
ment resembles his own:
“only when he know
Oyxon’s life from be-
ginning to end would he
be able to bring his own
life to its conclusion”,
Ismailov writes. Qodiriy
implores God to allow
him out “safe and sound;
then he would finish his
tale of Oyxon and follow
it up with a new, more
hard-nosed novel, set in
modern times.” He never
makes it out, instead being
executed in the October
following his arrest. The
novel he is constructing in
his head during his prison
sentence is lost, and it is
up to Ismailov to recon-
struct it for us.
The novel, with its
foundations deeply set in
Central Asian literature
and poetry, mines both
One Thousand and One
Nights, and the lyrical
poetry of the 19th century
as inspiration. And yet
unlike Scheherazade, who
needs to keep on telling
stories to secure her safety,
Qodiriy is acutely aware
of the limitation time has
on his imagination: “A
Thousand and One Nights
goes on and on only in
fairy tales”, his jailers tell
him, “We can put a stop to
this right now.”
It is this undercurrent of
ever-present danger that
drives him in a quest for
survival, as he attempts
to hold on until he can
complete the novel. In
Ismailov’s exploration of
the nature of literature, he
highlights the difference
between the conception
and completion of a
novel, as well as the
reasons behind the drive
to create art. The novel is
“an enquiry into a human
being’s spirit, his identity,
in much the same way as
a prison interrogration,”
a jailer informs Qodiriy,
highlighting the power
and violence of writing.
For Ismailov’s Qodiriy,
aswellasQodiriy’sNodira
and Oyxon, writing has an
intoxicating power over
their own lives, and the
lives of others. Qodiriy
is “aware of the effect
that the ‘made-up’ could
have on real life”, and
the threat that his writing
will “vanish without a
Hamid Ismailov // Index on Censorship
“It is a novel
that celebrates
the rich history
of Central
Asian culture
– one political
repression
threatened to
erase”
trace” hangs over him.
As one aphorism quoted
in the book goes: “Saying
‘halva’ once doesn’t bring
a sweet taste to your
mouth, but after a hundred
times, your teeth will start
sticking together”.
Interspersed with
poetry translations from
Farndon, The Devil’s
Dance is a novel that
celebrates the rich history
of Central Asian culture
– a culture that political
repression threatened
to erase. From descrip-
tions of Uzbek nature
and food – the rice dish
plov is frequently men-
tioned – to celebration
of the Uzbek language,
Ismailov’s novel is a vital
introduction to a world I’d
never encountered before.
While it can be a bit
heavy going for readers
like me, with no exposure
to Central Asian culture,
and many of the historical
references flew straight
over my head, it remains a
beautiful and nuanced ex-
ploration of what it means
to be a writer.
