Whatever the after
dinner pursuits of today's
undergraduate, one question sure to
crop up over the coffee is the correct approach
to business success.
Across the board achievement at university has
shown that success is not a matter of chance. Any route
worth taking will be a demanding one, involving
high-quality training for professional qualifications,
enabling you to meet the varied challenges of a
business career.
Throwing yet another six, you realise that it would
be only sensible to join an accountancy and manage-
ment consultancy firm able to set an outstanding
example of performance and innovation.
Pondering the card in front of you, you'll realise
that these are not trivial questions. The answer to the
first one, fortunately is simple.

We think you'll find the answers soon fall into place.
