N e w s
Guilds' Vice mauled—official!
Tanya Maule, a first year chemical
engineer, was elected Vice President
of City and Guilds College Union at
the Election U G M on Tuesday. She
fills the position left vacant by Chris
Simpson on failing his second year
exams.
After a short speech from each
candidate and proposer, M s Maule
was elected with a sizeable majority.
She is the first fresher to be elected
to the Guilds Executive.
• F E L I X interviewed M s Maule
following her victory. She revealed
that she first considered standing for
V P on meeting Dave Tyler, the
Guilds Union President, at the joint
C C U Christmas Party in Freshers'
Week. She had mentioned that she
was interested in Rag, mascotry and
Ents to him and he claimed that these
interests along with limitless
enthusiasm were the qualities
necessary for V P . The following day
she gathered a proposer and seconders
from amongst her fellow first-years
and started to organise her campaign.
Clearly with only two weeks at IC
prior to the election she needed to
ensure plenty of publicity prior to the
election in order to stand a chance
against the other candidates. She feels
that questions asked of the candidates
at the U G M were fair and although
some, such as 'who is responsible for
Rag i n Guilds', put her at a
disadvantage they were all very
relevant.
Predictably she is not willing to
sacrifice her degree to the running of
C & G U . However, she believes that
she can effectively manage both. Her
ambitions at this early stage are to
increase participation i n Union
events, particularly amongst first-
years, and to abolish the present
elitism which alienates rank and file
students from the management o f
C & G U . Like every V P before, she
hopes to raise more money for Rag
than before and plans several new

events which could involve B o
appearing more often. She expects the
full co-operation of the two other
vice-presidential candidates and many
officers in C & G U have pledged their
support. Initially she w i l l be
informally assisted by Dave Tyler and
previous V P s Chris Simpson and
Simon Corns, but she hopes to be in
full control by Rag Week.
M r Tyler denies that asking M s
Maule to stand was showing any
favouritism as he sees his role as
encouraging as diverse a selection of
candidates as possible. He views
having a female first-year Vice
President as a positive advantage as
C & G U has previously' had a lack of
involvement from women and
freshers.
• Defeated candidate, K e n
Pendlebury, bears no grudges against
the new V P . He decided to run for
V P on hearing that M r Simpson,
whom he had shared a room with
during the summer, had failed his
exams. M r Pendlebury had intended
to run for V P in March, but had stood
down when M r Simpson announced
his cadidature.
Funds fiasco
The Commemoration Day ceremony
took place in the Royal Albert Hall
yesterday. Following the Fellows
awards, Professor Eric Ash delivered
a speech on universities and the public
fund cut. He revealed that Imperial
College now receives only 50% of its
funding from the University Grants
Committee. He went on to warn the
present Government of the dangers of
letting the universities rely heavily on
the private sector funding and cast a
gloomy picture for universities in the
next few years as they all compete for
the limited funding.
The Imperial College Annual
Report was published to coincide with
Commemoration Day. The 28-page
document is i n glossy brochure
format and contains articles on
College's relationship with industry,
past students and expenditure figures
for the last financial year. It reveals
that the total College income was
£66,385K whereas its expenditure
was £67,384K. This is the first year
that the College has spent more than
it received.

j • The rubric opened, as you might
expect, with a tribute to the
achievements ofIC students and staff
this year, including the election of
Mike Hassel and David Olive to the
Royal Society, and ofAlan Swanson,
Colin Besant and Ernie Freeman to
the fellowship of engineering. So to
St Mary's Hospital Medical School,
and the forthcoming merger.
Professor Ash is obviously an
optimist, as he proved when he
referred to the enthusiasm of St
Mary's students about the merger.
The experience of IC Union is rather
different.
And then onto an oldfavourite, lack
of money. The Rector raised the
possibility ofprivatising universities,
and then, not to anyone's surprise,
demolished it, mainly by pointing out
the lack of endowments coming in to
College funds. This naturally begged
the question: Are we doomed to be a
loss-making organisation ? Well,
apparently not. If—said the Rector—
you count the income to the country
which resultsfrom the graduation and
subsequent gainful employment ofan
Imperial College graduate, and
subtract from that the cost of that
graduate's education, we make about
£300M per annum for the UK. so,
dear Government, although we will
do our best to increase our degree of
self-funding, notably by the launch of
IMPEL, a company which exists to
exploit novel ideas and inventionsfor
profit, we still need your money to
survive in our present structure.
