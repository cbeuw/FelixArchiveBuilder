HOW TO IMPRESS YOUR
POTENTIAL EMPLOYER
Application Forms
If you really want
the job youare
applying for then
you must impress
your potential
employer with
your letter of
application,
application form
and/or curriculum
vitae. There are
obvious do's and
dont's such as
legibility and
appearance—try to
type your
application
(although some
application forms
ask you expressly
to fill them in in
your own
handwriting) and
lay it out sensibly.
• Always read any information on
the job you are applying for—find
out about the company and the kind
of people they employ. Larger
companes will produce recruitment
brochures which are ideal for this
information. Most brochures can be
obtained by telephoning the
company or sending a stamped
addressed envelope. The careers
library on Level 3 of the Sherfield
Building has a large number of
these brochures which you can
browse through at your leisure.
• Read the form carefully before
filling it in. It's a good idea to take
a photocopy of it first and fill that
in before completing thefinalcopy.
(This may sound tedious but you'll
always remember things you should
have put in after you'vefilledup the
space allowed!) The copy will come
in useful before you go into the
interview so that you don't
contradict yourself.
• You should answer all the
questions the form asks even if
some do not apply to you. It is
better to write N/A (not applicable)
than leave a blank.
• When answering open questions
such as 'why are you applying for
this job?', try not to use cliches.
Employers are looking for that
someone who is slightly different;
someone who can use their brain in
an original way. Most employers
will use such questions to sort the
'definites' from the 'maybes'. For
the same reason, never look at a
friend's application form to check
what they're putting. Two forms
with the same ideas stick out a mile.
• Always include as much relevant
information as you can. List all
your 0- and A-levels as most
employers still regard them as
important. List all your vacation
experience—even if you only
worked at the till in the Union
Snack Bar; it still shows that you
can use mental arithmetic.
• The questions such as 'what are
your leisure interests?' are designed
to discover your practical skills,
leadership abilities or if you like
working as a team. When
answering these questions, think of
what attributes the job needs and
gear your answers towards them.
You should never give negative
information about yourself—always
sell yourself.
•As appearance is particularly
important, don't include spelling
mistakes or crossing-out. You
should try to lay out your answers
well in the area available—never put
all the words crammed at the top of
the white space.
If you are not applying for a
specific job then you may have to
include your own application form.
It is best to model this on one of the
forms you can obtain from the
College Careers Office.
