Dutch
courage
The Holland Club, the staff bar, has
arranged a programme of music for
the rest of October. Ex-Imperial band

their mellower songs next Thursday.
A l l members and their guests are
welcome and the entertainment is

Policeman
injured
A policeman was injured during a
roof top chase in Cranley Gardens on
Sunday. The policeman, P C Andy
Morby fell fifteen feet through a
skylight whilst chasing suspects
across a slippery roof, sustaining
injuries to his shoulders, hands and
abdomen.
The police were alerted to the
burglary at 3.45pm by a member of
the public. Nine vehicles, including
two fire engines which were used to
observe the roof arrived on the scene.
A police helicopter was diverted from
the Tottenham football match to scan
the area using closed-circuit T V , but
no arrests were made.
Flan
ban
The Hitsquad will be restricted this
year due to an agreement between
C & G U and College. No hits will take
place in lecture theatres and students
will be able to purchase immunity
from flanning.
Musical
movement
A petition is being drawn up aginst
withdrawal of the Music Room
without provision of alternative
facilities of comparable quality. The
petition states this would result in a
marked deterioration in the musical
life of the College. Six pages of
signatures have been collected so far.
Anyone who wants to sign should see
Alan Downie (Maths PG) or visit the
Union Office.
Fire and
damnation
There were red faces all round
â€¢yesterday when the West London
Chaplaincy set off the fire alarms in
Southside. The Selkirk -Breakfast
group caused the incident when the
toast they were cooking in the T V
lounge activated a smoke detector.
The alarm was turned off by the
Linstead messenger ten minutes later.
A spokesperson for the W L C
explained that the detector was
normally covered with a plastic cup
to avoid this problem, but added that
on this occasion the cup must have
fallen off.
Seymour goes
bananas
The first ICU Council of the year was
held on Monday. Council Chairman
Alastair Seymour apologised for the
postponement which he said was due
to late the circulation of papers.
Topics which were discussed
included the St Mary's Medical
School merger. President Ian
Howgate proposed honorary
membership of the Union for all St
Mary's students this year, allowing
them to vote and stand in elections for
next year's Union officers. It was
noted that there was a lack of
communication between both St
Mary's Union and Imperial College
Union. Council members were also
concerned about the lack o f
communication between the
Executive and the rest of Council
about the merger plans. M r Howgate
believes that St Mary's Union is
frightened of being swamped by ICU.
Stormy
weather
While Hyde Park may look like a
battlefield, College itself was barely
scarred by Friday's storm. Fourteen
windows were broken, though most
of these were small, apart from the
plate glass window on a gallery level
in Tizard Hall. In the Life Science
Department's pilot plant, a skylight
pane was lifted and later found some
15 feet away still intact. It is expected
to be refitted by the end of the week.
Ashfelt on the Union Building was
also lifted, which has led to the re-
roofing being brought forward. The
main victims of the storm have been
the trees, with many branches being
brought down. College reports that
two small trees are still missing.
