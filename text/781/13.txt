Things to remember
General employment prospects
Since the low in 1981/82
employment prospects have been
rising steadily. Imperial has one of
the lowest full unemployment rates,
which is getting still lower. Backed
up by other measures, this indicates
the country-wide recovery which is
particularly evident here. There are
now morejobs on offer, more visits
from employers and more jobs
available at Summer Fairs.
Electronics and computer science
are the areas which produce the
highest demand. Recruitment levels
in manufacturing have improved.
Finance (banking, accountancy,
insurance and commodities) and
retailing employers are particularly
keen to recruit science and
engineering graduates.
Of course, there will always be
those who make no effort to look
for work but they are making a big
mistake. Around 300 electronics
graduates were unemployed at the
beginning of last year through
falling into this trap. You must
realise that you are the one doing
the seeking, not your future
employer. It would also be very
foolish to only apply for one job,
or to go for something that is
obviously beyond your capabilities.
The attainment of a pass degree
after five years at college is not a
sufficient qualification for R&D—
but there is always someone who
doesn't realise this.
Taking a year off
A year off, taken before university,
is welcomed almost universally.
Alternatively, many think seriously
about having some time off between
graduation and full-time
employment. This can be rewarding
and productive, but it must be noted
that if you are over 24, you may be
advised to seek careers advice,
depending on your choice of
profession. Otherwise, there are no
problems, although it helps to have
a clear idea of what you plan to do
with the year and one which you
can articulate—perhaps to a future
employer. You should be able to
talk about what your aims were,
what you gained from the
experience, etc. You should also
think ahead. For example, it might
be fun going jackarooing in
Australia for 12 months but you will
hardly be well placed to apply for
jobs back in the UK. For the same
simple reasons 12 months off have
often become 15 or more.
Remember the vacancy lists in
September are probably shorter
than in another time of the; year.
Nevertheless, given some thought
and planning, some time off after
graduation can be fun, productive
and for many, a time of great
personal development.
Temporary work
While the great majority of
graduates want permanent work,
each year there are those who, for
a variety of reasons, seek temporary
work. In thinking of the longer term
career prospects, virtually all
previous work experience is useful,
even valuable. Here in London
temporary work is not hard to find.
I can cover many possibilities, from
part-time work in MacDonalds to
challenging administrative jobs. Job
Centres can be a good source of
such work and there are a number
of specialist agencies. Catch 22 is
one such firm (it's harder to get a
job without experience and you
can't get experience without a job).
Although your work might be far
removed from your ultimate
ambition, it does give valuable
insights into people and the nature
of work. It can also be a useful way
of funding that year off.
Summer Fairs
It has always been wrong to think
of recruitment as being a January
to March phenomenon associated
with the Graduate Recruitment
Programme, otherwise known as
the 'milk-round'. In fact
recruitment is increasingly
becoming an all-the-year round
event. Nevertheless outside the
GRP the next busy peak is during
the Summer Fairs. This is the time
in June and July, starting
immediately after finals, when there
are about 10 Fairs throughout the
country. Of these, London is by far
the biggest. This year almost 200
employers attended during its three
days with a wide variety of jobs on
offer. Thus these events are
particularly useful for those who
have not wanted to think about jobs
prior to graduation.
A cynic's view
The 'Milkround', in a nutshell, is
a system that companies use to
recruit graduates every year. A
company will contact the careers
services at a university, and will
arrange to visit the College on some
day, for the 'first interviews'.
In the meantime, recruitment
personnel may have attended a
'careers fair' at the College, and
distributed lots of applications
forms along with expensive, glossy
brochures, extolling the virtues of
their company. They then sit back
and wait for the floods of
applications.
They make a selection of these
and interview at the College. They
may also (like IBM) apply their own
brand of 'aptitude test' at this stage.
If they like you, you are invited for
second a interview at the
prospective place of employment.
On that basis they make their
choice.
It's all very simple and
convenient for all. The students,
initially at least, don't even have to
leave College. The employers, in
theory, come to College and get the
pick of the best graduates.
So, what's the matter? There are
two problems with the Milkround;
one old, and one new.
The old problem is that only some
companies can afford the resources
to visit Colleges up and down the
country. This means that students
relying entirely on the Milkround
are only going to apply to 'Large'
companies in certain areas. To test
this out, walk around Careers Fair
(as I once did) and find out how
many companies aren't involved in
defence work. Compare that to the
national average. You will find
quite a difference.
So, the students that rely only on
the Milkround are restricting their
choice. As long as they are
reasonably forward looking, and
realise that the Milkround is only
a small proportion of what's on
offer, then this isn't such a problem.
What's the more recent second
problem?
This time, it's from the
companies. Less and less are
finding the Milkround worthwhile.
Visiting dozens of universities and
interviewing hundreds of students
isn't cheap. To make it worthwhile,
it must produce results. However,
because it's so easy for the students,
many are applying to companies
they have very little interest in, just
on the off-chance. Even if they are
offered a second interview, they can
always turn it down if something
better comes along.
Companies are finding other
ways to recruit. Advertising directly
to students may be more cost
effective. They may get less replies
if the student has to do more work,
but the replies they get will be the
most highly motivated.
One way the graduate
employment market may change
soon is that the employment
agencies, very common amongst
the 'real' job market, may move
into graduate recruitment. A
company might 'contract out' it's
graduate recruitment to an agency,
which will do all the preliminary
advertising, interviewing, testing
and so on. You would apply to one
agency, and may well be offered a
job in any of the companies which
use that agency.
What will this mean for the
student? Probably not very much.
The people that seem to get the best
jobs are those that have gone out
and looked themselves.
