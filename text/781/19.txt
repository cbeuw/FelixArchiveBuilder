Curriculum
Vitae
Your curriculum vitae is one of the
most important ways to make a
good first impression. It is always
asked for if a company does not
have its own application form. It is
useful for speculative applications
and can be photocopied when you
are making multiple applications.
A CV should be concise and not
more than two pages long.
Employers who have hundreds of
CVs to read through will never get
past the second page. Again, as with
application forms, the appearance
is essential: Either use a typewriter,
word processor or have it typeset.
The last two methods have the
added advantage that small changes
can be made in order to stress
different points.
There should be five sections to
your CV.
• Personal details—this should
include your name, address, date of
birth, contact numbers and marital
status. If you are a foreign student
you must give details about working
permits.
• Education—This is best listed in
chronological order although
reverse chronology is a good way
of emphasising your degree course.
Mention the major subjects studied
at degree level as well as your O-
and A-level subjects but avoid
boring lists packed with too much
information.
• Previous employment—you are
not expected to have vast
experience as an undergraduate but
all previous jobs should be listed.
You should try to include a little
more information about the jobs
you have had which have any
relevance to the one you are
applying for.
• Leisure interests and
achievements —this is your chance
to sell your abilities. Employers
don't want one-dimensional people

who come across as boring
academics. You should mention any
Union clubs you are an active
member of and any posts you have
held eg Union President. Try to
include anything which shows that
you are capable of getting a job
done or of taking initiatives.
• References—employers' will
often want to ask a third party about
you. It is best to include the name
of two referees at the bottom of
your CV. Always ask your intended
referees if they mind being asked to
give a reference. One of your
referees should be in a senior
position such as your personal tutor
or head of department, who has
worked with you for the last few
years.
Application
letters
Always apply for ajob by letter and
use this letter to tell your
prospective employer why you want
the job and your relevant skills. If
you are responding to an
advertisement which details the
person they are looking for,
respond to every point and give
relevant evidence. The letter should
be brief, but informative, and
should be kept down to one A4
page. Employers will use this letter
to judge what sort of person you are
and how well you express yourself
on paper.
