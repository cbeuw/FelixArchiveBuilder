GETTING THROUGH
THE INTERVIEWS
After you have
overcome the first
obstacle to getting
the job-
preselection—there
is the daunting
prospect of the
first interview.
Most of you will
have already
undergone at least
one formal
interview when
you were applying
to universities in
your sixth form.
The first interview
will be similar to
this because the
company will be
interested in
finding out about
you and whether
you are right for
them
• Presentations—Many large
companies who go 'on the Milk
Round' will give presentations to
the candidates at their own
universities. This will give you an
opportunity to discover more about
that company and ask any questions
you may have. You will be able to
study the sort of graduate they
already employ and gain a feel for
their sort of management. Most
presentations are in the early
evening and include food and drink.
They are well worth attending as
they will be brief and by meeting
your interviewer in a relaxed
atmosphere before your interview
will make it much more easy to talk
when you meet him/her in a more
formal atmosphere.
• First interview—the interviewer
will base thefirstinterview on your
application form and/or curriculum
vitae. He/she will want to know
why you are doing a degree in
science/engineering; why you
selected certain subjects to
specialise in in your final year; what
sort of degree you are expecting to
get; and what experience you have.
Some of the questions will be
probing such as why did you stand
for departmental representative?
What did you have to do as Vice
President of your favourite club?
Other questions will be open-ended
and very difficult to answer. Be
prepared to answer questions about
your previous employment and to
comment on how management
could have improved the
organisation: show the interviewer
that you have your own ideas.
It is almost certain that the
interviewer will ask why you have
applied for their job so it's well
worth preparing an answer. Don't
reel off an answer though—at least
make it sound like it's off the cuff.
They may also assume that you
know their company inside out—
always do your homework on the
company thoroughly before the
interview.
Interviewers are looking for your
particular strengths and
weaknesses. They are testing your
ability to communicate. They want
to see that you are genuinely
enthusiastic about their company
and the job they are offering. The
first interview will probably be held
in a departmental room if it is on
behalf of a 'milk round company'.
It will last about 30 minutes which
gives just enough time for the
interviewer to gauge if you are
worth asking back for a second,
much longer, interview. Always
appear interested (even though you
may be bored out of your mind by
the questions the interviewer is
asking) and remember that he/she
will usually have made up his/her
mind after thefirst5 minutes of the
interview—good interviewers spend
the next 25 checking out their first
impression.
• Second interview—most second
interviews will take place at the
company's headquarters. Second
interviews are worth going to as
larger companies will put you up in
a five-star hotel and pay all
expenses you may incur. You will
have the opportunity to eat and
drink as much as you like and try
out that Jacuzzi in your hotel room!
Second interviews are vastly
different from all other interviews
you may have attended. You will
meet new people, new
environments and come up against
other enthusiastic, motivated
candidates who are after the same
job. You may be put through
several interviews, intelligence
tests, group exercises and talking to
a wide range of recent recruits and
potential managers.
• Group exercises—these are
specifically designed to observe
how you get on with people and
your ability to work as a team. A
leader may be appointed and a
chosen topic debated while
assessors observe how you
perform. They are looking for
effective contributors who can sway
the discussion. This may also be
done through role-playing where
each person is given a position of
responsibility with a role to play. In
these situations the case study is
unlikely to have any 'right' outcome
as the assesors are looking at the
way you operate and how
effectively you are thinking.
•Written tests—there are several
sorts of written test. Some test your
intelligence while others try to test
your personality! You may have to
undergo verbal reasoning tests,
numerical tests or even motivation
tests. It may come as a relief to
know that you cannot fail a
personality test. These tests,
however, are designed to tell you
and the employer if you are
manager or dustman material. It's
always possible to cheat in such
tests but you may end up with a job
which is totally unsuited to you.
