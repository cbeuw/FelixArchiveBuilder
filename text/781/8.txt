Academic affairs
By now most of you will be settling
into the routine of lectures, practicals
and tutorials—some of you will be
finding it easier than others. But i f
you are having problems the Union's
Academic Affairs system is here to
help you.
Academic Representatives—around
this time your Departmental
Representative (Dep Rep) should be
holding (or may already have held)
elections for the posts of Academic
Representatives ( A c Reps). Each
subject group has 2 A c Reps per year
depending on the size of the group.
The A c Reps are the first line o f
representation between you and the
staff. If your lecturer is inaudible
his/her writing/overheads illegible or
the problem sheets incomprehensible
then it's your A c Rep's job to point
this out to the lecturer concerned
(politely!). The A c Reps should also
meet the course convener/organiser
at regular intervals to discuss how that
particular lecturer course is
progressing.
The Dep Rep and all the A c Reps
in the Department form the student
side of the Departmental Staff-Student
Committee. This committee deals
with matters throughout the
department. F o r example how a
course could be improved or facilities
for the students common room.
If a problem can't be resolved
within the Department then it can be
taken to the respective C C U
Academic Affairs Officer (AAO) who
may be able to resolve the matter. The
four A A O s (including myself are
responsible for representing the
student body as a whole on various
College Academic committees with
important sounding names such as
Board of Studies, Careers Advisory,
Admissions P o l i c y , Vacation
Training, Undergraduate Studies, etc,
dealing with such matters as lecturer
training. In this repect it's worth
noting that while your teachers at
school will have had to go through
intensive training most lecturers
(although they may be experts in their
respective field) have only a very
brief training before they are dumped
in front of a hundred students and may
end up fumbling their way through
even the best prepared course.
Getting involved—where do you fit
in. Well for a start you could stand
as an A c Rep in your Department. As
a student rep you will get to know lots
of people within your Department and
also at C C U level. Of course with any
post comes responsibility too. You
will be expected to help your Dep Rep
and attend various Committees among
other things. Don't let that put you
off, though. To ensure a good deal for
students academically means that
ordinary students like yourselves
getting involved by standing for
election and repesenting the students
effectively.
There are also two posts available
for Ordinary Members of the Union's
Academic Affairs Committee and the
post of Secretary to the Academic
Affairs Committee (a post which I
held years ago). If you are interested
in standing and want to know what's
involved, please contact me via the
Union Office. The papers are up in
the Union foyer and the elections will
be held at the next Union General
Meeting.
Finally—your studies w i l l
(hopefully!) form the important part
of your time at IC and I hope that at
least some of you will want to get
involved with Academic Affairs. You
will certainly find the experience
rewarding.

More essentials
Ents, Ents, Ents that's all we seem to
talk about. Well there's a good reason
for that and that's because all the
events are such jolly good fun and
value for money. Before I sum up this
week's events I must first add that
Ents did not make £10,000 in
Freshers' Week; it was in fact more
like £3,000.
This week we have a double bill
featuring The Lover Speaks, fresh
from their Eurythmics support tour,
and a very nice group of boys from
North London called The Gospel. The
former play a good mix of colourful
rock with a good uptempo feel and
very interesting vocals. The voice is
that o f David Freedman, who is
currently in conspiracy with Alison
Moyet in her latest single which was
reviewed not so long ago in these
pages. It is also rumoured that A & M
will be down at the gig giving away
records. The Gospel are an energetic
young band whose only aim in life is
to entertain, having recently done
several gigs at the Mean Fidler
including a proclaimers support. They
are well worth seeing. Doors open at
about 8.30pm and entry is £2 in
advance and £2.50 on the door or
£1.50 Ents cards. There is the usual
late bar and also a disco to fill in the
gaps.
Next week there should be a disco
and free band on Thursday or Friday
and Saturday the 7th sees the first
Comedy Night so keep your eyes
peeled.

Chairman of Parties Person.
Review
The first of a regular series of gigs
put on by I C Ents took place last
Friday when the Ents Room in the
Union Building rocked to the sound
of Circus Circus Circus (or Circus x
3 as they proclaimed on the hats and
t-shirts they were busy selling!).
The night was advertised as a live
band and disco starting at 9pm and
running (with bar extension until
12am) until lam. Surprisingly that's
just what it was although the disco
didn't really start to fill up until about
10.15pm in readiness no doubt for the
band due on stage at 10.30pm. Some
people (shock, horror) were even
dancing to the disco prior to the
band's entrance! Finally, after a few
hitches (no one could find the sound
technician), Circus x 3 arrived on
stage at 10.50pm.
The first, and only, two words to
describe the band that sprang to mind
were 'loud'; there was more than one
request to turn down the volume, and
'dunamic'; the lead vocalist didn't
appear to pause for breath once and
continued to jump around stage
throughout the performance.
Circus x 3 are not really to my taste
and I cannot remember much of their
music except that it seemed to have
neither rhythm nor tune and the
vocals were indistinct. Many people,
however, enjoyed the whole evening
and I think it was more than worth the
£1 entrance if only for the disco and
bar extension.
