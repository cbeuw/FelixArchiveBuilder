Neal's Y a r d
Around the corner from Food for
Thought, off Shorts Gardens
(Covent Garden tube)
The food is not quite as good or
varied as Food for Thought.
However, it is cheap and usually less
crowded.
Bunjies
27 Litchfield Street W C 2
(Leicester Square tube)
Good food and folk music after 8pm
for £2.
The Jazz Cafe
Newington Green Road, across from
Newington Green
(73, 141 and 171 buses)
Very good, moderately priced food.
The music is free though the place is
very small.
Rice and Spice
Stoke Newington High Street, near
Church Street N16
(73 bus)
Very plain decor but good Indian
food. Bring your own bottle. There
are also other, more expansive places
nearby on Church Street.
Sole M i o
23 Gillingham Street SW1
(Victoria tube)
Around the corner from the Seafresh
Fish Bar. Varied menu with pastas
and omelettes under £2; a hearty daily
special for £3.
Gaby's
30 Charing Cross Road W C 2
(Leicester Square tube)
Selection of vegetarian and Middle
Eastern food. Very much like an
American diner.
The Witches of Eastwick
The sleepy New England town of
Eastwick is a dull place, for three
women lving there, all single and
strongly independent, life has lost its
sparkle. Jane (Susan Sarandon) has
just finalised her divorce, Alexandra
(Cher) is a widow and mother who
sculpts dolls, and Sukie (Michelle
Pfeiffer) is a successful journalist who
was deserted by her husband who left
her with six children. Every Thursday
they meet to relax and share their
problems and a few drinks. 'If men
aren't the answer, why do we always
end up talking about them?' concludes
Jane. Together they conjure up their
ideal man.
Soon they learn of the arrival in
town of a wealthy eccentric, Daryl
V a n H o m e (Jack Nicholson).
Intrigued by the stranger about whom
everyone is gossiping, they soon fall
prey to hjs charm when he claims to
be 'just your average horny little
devil'. He seduces all three women
and they move into his huge mansion.
However, back in town the rumours
fly and after the local snoop Felicia
(Veronica Cartwright) meets a sticky
end the women decide the menage a
trois must come to an end. Realising
their power, the witches and Van
Home set the stage for a battle of the
sexes.
Although outnumbered three to
one, Van Home is an ideal vehicle for
Nicholson to play his devilish best.
Here he has perfected the lunatic
character from The Shining and he is
simply superb as the manic demon,
who asks 'Are women one of God's
mistakes, like tidal waves?' when the
witches start to get the better of him.
Of course Nicholson steals the show,
given the ability to run amok and snarl
at the shocked townfolk. Underneath
his charm is a spoiled teenager at odds
with women, and in the three witches
he meets h i s match. Strong
performances by all three witches (in
particular Cher continuing her diverse
career) are enough to make this film
great entertainment, but what I found
unnecessary were the special effects
which today are almost obligatory. I
suppose they're a throwback to
director George Miller's Mad. Max
days but here they are nothing more
than old hat.
Eventually the film dissolves into
a flurry of special effects which round
off the plot, but somehow the
characters deserve better. Good
entertainment with Nicholson at his
best.
A.N.
Vegetarian and under £3 Omnivorious and under £3 Polio B a r
20 Old Compton Street W l
(Leicester Square tube)
Unlike Fatso's, Polio gives you
enough pasta the first time round so
you don't need seconds and the price
stays under £3! Get there early or face
a long queue.
Omnivorious and under £6
Cafe Pacifico
Langly Street
(Covent Garden tube)
It is a shame Mexican food must be
so expensive. This place is better than
Chi-Chi 's at Leicester Square and a
bit cheaper.

L a Pergola
138 Gloucester Road
(Gloucester Road tube)
If you've ever eaten Italian food
before, La Pergola's selection will
not excite you.
M y companion's complaints to the
elusive waiter, speaking in Italian
commanded the attention of the chef:
Yes, he admitted, the ravioli had
come from a tin.
The apparently reasonable prices,
which had enticed us there for lunch,
are misleading: Unordered, the two
salads which appeared with our main
course—seemingly included—are
extra (£1.50 each). Bread rolls are
65p per person (normally included in
real Italian restaurants). With the
obligatory 15% service charge it all
adds up to make a light lunch into an
expensive mistake.
Since the Pergola, Bellavista (132
Cromwell Road) and Vecchiomondo
Restaurants (118 Cromwell Road) are
all owned by Lorenzo's, you would
be advised to be very wary about
trying the other two (unless you're
prepared to argue in Italian). s.G.
