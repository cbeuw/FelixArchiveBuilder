CAREERS CASE STUDY
AND DUTY
FREE FAGS!
For many graduates, and
undergraduates, considering their
future career, the prospect of life in
the armed services is not one which
instantly springs to mind. However,
the armed forces continue to admit
a greater and greater proportion of
graduate officers, and the
opportunities which the services
offer make them an attractive option
in the hunt for a job.
First, however, it is best to point
out that all three branches have
common features which the would-
be applicant must be aware of. Most
obvious, is the realisation that they
are primarily 'fighting services'.
Medical and physical fitness are
most important, moving hand in
hand with a fundamental
commitment to the aims of the
Services, the Crown as Head of the
Armed Forces, defence of British
territory, the support of NATO, and
the implementation of Government
policy. Clearly, those with set
political ideas which they put above
all else need not apply. Membership
of the armed forces also carries with
it an automatic acceptance of
Service Law and discipline. Once
you take on this sort of
responsibility you will take on not
just a job, but a whole way of life.
It makes great demands on the
individual, but the rewards can be
enormous.
Officers are managers of men.
Leadership ability is not inherent in
all. However, if it is not
immediately apparent that you are
the sort of person to lead, this
should not discourage you. If you
have the capability, it will be
brought out in training.
There is a social and communal
life centred around the Officers'
Mess which manyfindattractive, as
well as almost unlimited sport and
leisure pursuits. Frequently
changing working environments,
undeniable comradeship, and a
sense of belonging are all valuable
considerations in looking at a career
in the forces.
The lack of a settled family life
is a problem which may not be
considered at first, but is bound to
cause great strain in later life.
This may not affect the new
graduate, but the sudden immersion
in a highly disciplined setting, and
the harsh regime of basic training,
are all barriers he or she must
overcome.
The Royal Navy
Eighty-seven per cent of this
country's imports and exports are
moved by sea. The role of the Royal
Navy is of vital importance in
maintaining this life blood.
The sea is the major difference
between the navy and the other
services. Life at sea is radically
different from any other way of life.
For long periods, you are living and
working in what is essentially an
alien environment.
In no other career are you forced
to know your employees as well,
have such a huge range of
professional knowledge, or take on
so much responsibility for your
fellow man at such an early age.
With as many as a thousand
servicemen on a single ship, the
need for this is clear.
For the graduate entrant to the
Royal Navy, training starts at
Britannia Royal Naval College in
Dartmouth, Devon. After an initial
six week new entry period, during
which sheer fatigue rather than
mental pressure is at the fore, you
will be taught all aspects of
seamanship, engineering,
navigation, and the basics that all
naval officers must know. At the
end of the first thirteen weeks, all
entrants, except pilots, go on to
spend nine weeks in the Dartmouth
training ship, learning how ratings
live, and reinforcing the lessons of
past weeks. Graduates go on to a
Fleet Board, after which they are
streamed off into their
specialisations.
There are opportunities for
engineers in the weapon's
engineering and marine engineering
branch, any graduate can join the
executive branch as a Seaman
Officer, and in administration as a
Supply Officer. Many graduates go
into the Instructor Officer
specialisation, the 'schoolies' as
they are known.
Commissions can commit you to
three years service or up to twenty-
two years depending on how certain
you feel about the job. Promotion
up to Lieutenant-Commander is
automatic, and 65% of Officers
progress past this stage.
The Royal Navy offers the
greatest prospect of travel in any of
the armed services. It is more a way
of life than any other, and can give
the greatest returns.
The Royal Air Force
Flying, and aircraft is what the
Royal Air Force is concerned with.
Whatever the chosen branch within
the profession, a strong interest in
aviation is essential. Aircrew pilots
and navigators are in great demand
and hold a crucial position. Team
work is still at the fore though, an
RAF station with two squadrons of
aircraft can be staffed by more than
1000 personnel. With the rapidly
changing state of aviation
technology, the RAF is strongly in
the graduate market, and graduate
entry is on the increase.
Application can be made initially
through the University Air
Squadron. There are sixteen of
these, with a total of 689
undergraduate flying students,
although as in all aspects of RAF
entry, competition is fierce.
Those accepted for entry into
officer training, having been
successful at the aircrew selection
centre in Biggin Hill, go on to the
Initial Training Course for officers
at the Royal Air Force College,
Cranwell in Lincolnshire, for
eighteen weeks. It is a short and
highly intensive course,
incorporating general and character
training to enable the new recruits
to fill posts successfully after their
specialist training.
At this point, the various
branches split up to pursue their
own specialisations. There are
opportunities for fighter controllers,
engineers, supply officers, on top
of aircrew. As with all services, the
graduate assumes his professional
and management roles at an early
stage in his career, and the
associated responsibility for
millions of pounds worth of
equipment. Promotion is rapid,
with squadron leader rank being
attained by about the age of thirty,
and further advancement probable.
The opportunities for women in
the RAF abound. Half the air traffic
control, secretarial and fighter
control posts are occupied by
women. Women graduates are also
needed in the education and
engineering areas.
The sheer cost of training calls
for the highest standards of
achievement. Total interdependence
is the hallmark of operating aircraft.
Consequently there is, once again,
a high communal spirit within the
RAF. The standard of training
received places you in a good
position not only within the service,
but upon leaving as well.
The Army
The major problem facing the
graduate about to apply for a
commission in the army is the vast
multiplicity of corps and regiments
in which one can work. The army
is subdivided into these 'family'
units, and fierce pride is actively
encouraged within each of these
units. An applicant does not apply
to the army in general, but must get
'sponsorship' or 'cap badging' from
a regiment, and is given
familiarisation with that regiment
before his or her RCB (Regular
Commissions Board), the army
interview.
If you are successful at your
RCB, you will go on to a twenty-
eight week graduate course at
Sandhurst. Once again, great
physical demands are made during
training, aiming to produce both
physical and intellectual
competence under stress.
The army officer's traditional aim
is to rise to command of his
regiment by the age of about forty.
This type of staff work can occur
after about four or five years of
service, and the army officer's
career then alternates between staff
work and tours of active duty within
the regiment. This lends great
variety to a career in the army.
Once again, an army officer is
required to develop an 'esprit de
corps', be gregarious, and have the
capability of making decisions in
quickly changing situations.
Foreign travel is almost guaranteed,
but you should expect to be sent to
serve in Northern Ireland and be
prepared for this.
It is the characteristic of caring
for others reinforced by the family
atmosphere of the regiment which
is at the core of things. This sense
of belonging serves to counter
balance a way of life full of travel
and family moves.
