Let me take this opportunity to
apologise for the hideous number of
pages in this issue. Even with 36 we
still had trouble fitting all the copy in.
For this reason, I have had to prune
the small ads section down to one
column. From now on my editorial
policy is that the boring ads get cut
first—so if you want your ad to go in,
try and make it slightly more exciting
than the one's we've been receiving
recently.
Music Room
Alan Downie, Chairman of the
Chamber Music Society, has started
a petition to save the music rooms in
Prince's Gate. Please sign the one in
the Union Office i f you are even
vaguely interested i n saving
Imperial's music facilities.
Security
A s the crime rate continually
increases in London, I am particularly
concerned about the lack of security
in the Halls of Residence. The locks
in Southside have only been changed
once since its construction in the
1960s. That means that at least seven
students have held your room key and
countless Summer Accommodation
Centre residents. I recently enquired
about my room key. I was told that
six were originally copied and that all
have gone missing over the past few
years. Not only copies of my key but
Hall masters have disappeared. It was
only when expensive equipment
started going missing in Linstead last
year that it was finally decided to
change the locks around. Obviously
College can't afford to change locks
every year but every fourth year is not
unreasonable. I certainly wouldn't
mind paying a little extra in my rent
for increased security.
Norman's
This F E L I X contains an Eye Spy in
the Union Snack Bar. We asked for
views on the food. It seems you either
love it or hate it, depending on how
hot and nutritious you like your food.
I personally like 'Norman's' but I
know many others who find the food
depressing. I can only suggest that if
you want something that isn't already
offered in the Snack Bar, that you
write it down and post it in their
suggestions box. I'm sure they'd
welcome all constructive criticism and
suggestions—as long as it doesn't
mention chips!
Commemoration Day
This year's Annual Report was
released yesterday at the
Commemoration Day ceremony in
the Royal Albert Hall. It is the usual
glossy prospectus for past students
with many pretty pictures of students
and academics enjoying themselves.
It even contains a picture of the
F E L I X staff hard at work—so it can't
be all bad! I can't help feeling a little
cynical about a l l the College
publications I've seen recently. They
contain too many happy faces and
rosy outlooks. Unfortunately the
publicity doesn't seem to have
achieved the desired effect—despite
Professor Eric Ash pledging to try to
raise the number of women students
entering Imperial, the number has
decreased this year.
Professor A s h mentioned in his
Commemoration Day speech that
50% of Imperial's income is derived
from private and industrial sources.
He guesses that i f the Government
continues on its course o f
disinvestment that universities will
either go bankrupt or privatise like
Stamford in America. College has a
Public Relations Officer a n d
Industrial Liaison Officer who spend
their lives trying to coax more money
out of industry and the alumni. But
how long can this go on? How many
glossy brochures do we have to
endure? It is time that staff and
students unite and fight. To quote the
Rector: the Government must begin
'to appreciate the very real and
irrevocable damage which is now
being done to institutions such as
Imperial College'.
Petit Gripe
I've just noticed the photo credits in
the Annual Report and there's not one
mention of F E L I X amongst them all.
I remember thinking this when I saw
a similar incident in Network last
week and I C Engineer the week
before. Last time we do College a
favour!
Finally...
There will be the usual staff meeting
at 1.00pm today.
