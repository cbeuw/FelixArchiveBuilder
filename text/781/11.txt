So you want a job?
By the end of the Careers Fair, you
will be fed up with hearing about
the world of work. However, and
sad though it is, it must be faced one
day. FELIX begs to offer a few
words of advice about the most
common choices of profession.
Accountancy
In 1985,10,000 UK graduates were
registered as trainees in
accountancy, hopefully heading for
membership of one of the six major
professional bodies in this country.
After passing professional
examinations, and gaining three
years recognised experience, they
are then ready to become fully
fledged yuppies. Positions tend to
open up about the time you hear
about your degree result, operating
on a day release basis. The choice
of positions is actually very wide,
and the first BMW tends to arrive
after about four years.
Actuarial Work
I didn't know what this was either,
but an actuary is basically an
accountant with a crystal ball,
dealing with life assurance,
pensions, stocks, bonds and so
forth. This involves a study of
probability, compound interest and
statistical techniques, and their
application to finance in general.
Courses are either
correspondence or postgraduate,
and lead to examinations for
fellowship of the Institute (FIAs) or
the Faculty (FFAs), of which there
are almost three thousand members.
One year full-time postgraduate
courses are run by City University
in Heriot Watt, bypassing about half
the membership exams for the
institutes. Definitely hard work to
get into, but as the brochure says,
it can be very rewarding. In other
words, lucrative.
Advertising
The many ways of entering into the
world of advertising cannot be
detailed here due to the lack of a
few hundred pages, but the main
recognised course is run by the
Institute of Practitioners in
Advertising, open to staff of
member agencies. In other words,
get your job, then get your training.
This tends to be on an in-house
rather than on a day release basis—
for example, staff who enter Media
departments almost always train on
the job, whilst creative staff tend to
come from full-time courses at
college, usually in an arts or related
subject.
Starting salaries in London in
1985 averaged £8,500, with some
first year rises of up to £2000. This
is quite good going, but if you
haven't achieved what isreferredto
as director status by your early
thirties, you are counted as a
failure. The potential for ulcers
could be quite high.
Biology
About forty per cent of biology
graduates in the UK in 1986 entered
a related subject, which reflects a
healthy demand for their services.
This can be confirmed by a glance
down the appointment pages of such
journals as New Scientist. Any
careers service should also provide
copies of 'Forward Vacancies',
covering April to November, and
'Current Vacancies', covering May
in your final year and onwards.
Biochemistry
Last year, about 60% of
Biochemistry graduates went on to
gain employment in an area related
to their degree. Most of the rest,
one sadly assumes, went on to
become accountants. One third of
this sixty per cent went into
industry, tending to be employed
directly from college.
Broadcasting, Film and Theatre
The situation can be summed up by
describing the BBC Radio
Journalism course: 12 places, 8000
applicants. Getting into this area is
very difficult, and nobody can
really tell you any more. There are
few courses available, and they tend
to be incredibly oversubscribed.
You have to be prepared to apply
for absolutely anything, probably
about 500 times. The best bet for
this is the Guardian on Mondays,
with several pages of relevant
positions. With the competition so
hot, you have to be prepared for
repeated failures, and it is as well
if you can get some relevant
experience—Stoic, Dramsoc and IC
Radio are your best bet while at
college, as they have been known
to work for people in the past. Go
for it, and good luck.
The City
If you want to work in the smelly
bit in the middle of London which
rejoices under the name of The
City, you will find it a fairly small
area of graduaterecruitment,most
institutions still preferring to recruit
school leavers with good 'A' levels.
This explains why the yuppie at the
end of your road can afford a
GTi—he didn't bother with
university. This doesn't exclude
you, though. First degrees are
consideredrelevant,particularly in
Computer Science. Try the Stock
Exchange Visitors Gallery, Lloyds
of London Viewing Area, and the
London Metal Exchange for further
information.
Computing
Let's face it, there are so many
opportunities for graduates from
DoC that they cannot be listed.
Apart from the possibility of
working in the City—yup yup yup-
posts are also found in engineering,
medicine, broadcasting, publishing,
science subjects of all sorts, sales,
marketing, all sorts ofresearch,and
of course, in the world of
computing itself. The world is your
EPROM—blow it as you will.
Engineering
'Engineering is an exciting,
practical world which is concerned
with making things happen.' While
this is undoubtedly true, there is
little question that the UK engineer
does not share the same financial
reward and prestige as his US and
Japanese counterparts. As a result
of this as many as a third of
Imperial engineering graduates
pursue careers in other
disciplines—eg accountancy, retail
management, etc.
For those committed to
engineering 'chartered status' is
almost essential, and is possible
through the relevant professional
institution. Careers are available for
research, design, development
through to manufacture, although
promotion inevitably leads into the
broader concerns of management.
Marketing and Sales
There are three ways of entering
marketing: by direct entry from
college, via a postgraduate course,
of which there are many, or from
work in some related field. Direct
entry can be risky, as- many
companies use the word marketing
to describe burning your guts out at
an early age as a sales grunt. On the
whole, postgraduate courses or
subsequent transfer are your best
bet, and can lead to a fast and
profitable career. Adverts in the
papers; Evening Standard or the
Guardian are a major source all the
year round, but they have also
produced some of the most
dishonest advertising I have ever
seen—this probably sums up the
business of sales and marketing
quite well: you exist to present
things in a favourable light. In other
words, you lie.
Publishing
Good quality papers carry lists of
publishing appointments, and these
are likely to be about your only
source of inspiration, apart from
trade papers. In applying for these
positions, it is important to detail
any relevant experience you may
have. Obviously if you are at IC,
you aren't on a related course, but
you might have some experience
anyway. You could join FELIX, for
example—last year's FELIX editor
is now Assistant Editor on Digital
Review—so it can be done. Salaries
are not high, but job satisfaction can
be, as any member of FELIX staff
will tell you. Or else.
Personnel Work
Although many people enter
directly into the world of personnel
from a first degree or previous
employment, full-time courses are
also available, leading in this
country to examinations for
membership of the institute of
Personnel Management. Member-
ship is generally thought to be an
advantage, but is not an absolute
requirement for entry into the
profession. Management trainees or
those with previous work
experience are also welcome, due
to their wider grounding in the trials
and tribulations of the big wide
world out there.
