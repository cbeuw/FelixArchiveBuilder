Jolly hockey
sticks: Part 1
IC 1st X I - 2
Thames Valley 1st X I — 1
Imperial College Hockey 1st X I
opened their Middlesex League (1st
division) account with an excellent
w i n over Thames V a l l e y at
Harlington on Saturday. The win was
all the more impressive because it was
the first time that the new squad had
played together.
Unusually for IC, the defence and
new reshuffled midfield were the
most influential units. The attack did,
however, show bursts of the magic
which won last year's University of
London League title.
Once the attack has settled down
together, and i f the influential
Vamadevan can recover his old
'wobble', this new-look side should
stock up the Hockey Club's trophy
shelf again this season.
Part 2
IC lst X I - 0
Spencer-Jennings Select X I — 0
On Sunday the College's premier
hockey side travelled to Earlsfield to
be entertained by a Spencer X I
specially selected from the London
League Club's 2nd and 3rd teams by
ex-IC impressario David Jennings.
The side included several ex-IC
superstars and were expected to
present stiff opposition.
Skipper Justin Brooking, rueing the
night before (or was it morning
Anne?), sat out the first half, but was
ably replaced by U L U player Brendan
Farmer. The defence remained
otherwise unchanged from Saturday,
but the attack sorted three new faces
in Gary Knartborough, Julian Firth
and Richard Preston.
Spencer opened with a flurry of
superb team hockey, pinning IC into
their own half for nearly ten minutes.
Were it not for excellent defending by
Stonham and Garside, and tight
marketing by the half-backs, centred
on Paul Coleman, Spencer could have
put the game out of reach in the first
period. However, inspired by
Brooking at half time and marshalled
by the brilliant Coleman, IC took the
game to Spencer in the second half.
Despite creating many more goal
chances, IC failed to snatch victory,
but can be pleased with a draw against
possibly this year's toughest
opposition.
ORIENTEERING
Coaching first
Last Sunday, the Orienteering Club
achieved a first! Their first coach!
Enthusiasm has grown over the past
few years and because of the number
of new members, a coach was hired
for the day instead of the usual
minibus.
The days outing was to Gloucester
Park in Basildon and was an
introductory event for those new to
the sport. The courses were set on
mainly open land which was a little
marshy due to recent rain. The
courses were of different lengths and
different degrees of difficulty; the
hardest being a 9.1km Norwegian
course for experienced orienteers.
This is different to a normal course
in that parts of the course are given
at each control and can either be
memorised or drawn onto the map.
Everyone managed to complete
their course without getting severely
lost, the only major problem being
biros lost en route.
The day was considered quite
successful and the vast majority
expressed an interest in continuing
orienteering.
Anyone who is interested in trying
orienteering can come to the training
session on Thursday at 5.30pm in the
Union Gym.

First match
drawn
IC lst—3
Goldsmiths—3
After just one trial we faced our first
match against Goldsmiths College.
We were all a little unfit and rusty at
first. Consequently we conceded a
goal in the 24th minute. Periodically
we started playing the ball about
which was reminiscent of later years
style of play. Then in the 39th minute
we managed to breakthrough
Goldsmith's defence to make it 1—1.
We started the second half a lot
more confident and began to dominate
the game. Against the run of play
Goldsmiths managed to sneak a goal
on the break.
In the 70th minute IC hit back. It
was a text book move: the goalie
threw the ball to the right touch line,
the ball was laid square to Paul Dyson
who took it up the pitch and passed
it through the defence where Nigel
Collier ran on to it and finished the
move. In the 76th minute IC went in
front from a solo effort by Paul
Olden. In the last 10 minutes, with IC
tiring rapidly, Goldsmiths equalised
with a far post header to make the
final score 3—3
Paul Dyson (Captain).

Spring
Regatta
After the racing on Saturday was
cancelled due to damage from the
gales on Thursday the two crews
entered turned up for Sunday's racing
still in good spirits.
In one of the first races of the day
the Colleges Senior A coxless four
comfortably won their heat and so
getting a place in the final. The other
crew an Elite eight followed suit,
winning a place in the final
comfortably.
The Senior A coxless four had a
good start in their final and from this
led the field for the whole race to win
well. The Elite eight were not so
lucky and lost to an Under 23 Gold
Medal winning crew by just over a
second.
