EMPLOYING YOURSELF
KEEPING UP WITH
HOLOGRAPHY
Choosing a
career is never
easy, but for
Sunny Bains it
was easier than
for most.
Instead of
wandering
around Careers
Fair looking for
a job that
seemed suitable
in the right part
of the country
with a decent
company, Sunny
decided she
wanted to be
different. So, in
the middle of
her second year,
she decided
what her real
ambition was: to
combine her
enthusiasm for
journalism with
her love for
holography.
By the end of January 1987
"Holographies International" (Hi)
was an idea. By the end of March
it had a name and a post office box,
notepaper and business cards.
Getting the name was actually more
difficult than it sounds. Sunny had
to prove to Companies House in
Cardiff that the magazine would be
truly international before they
would give her permission to use
the name, due to some 1825 law.
Fortunately, with most of her
readers expected to be in the United
States, this was not a problem. In
May, letters were sent out to
prospective advertisers. In June
letters were sent to the United States
where Sunny was going to promote
the magazine. The holographic
community seemed enthusiastic and
by August Hi had acquired a
reasonable amount of material.
Paris and Cambridge provided a
few more contacts and by October
1st, just about all the copy was in.
Pasting up was done in five days flat
and on October 19th the magazine
was launched with smoked salmon
and champagne.
Though it may sound
straightforward, there were a lot of
difficult decisions to be made about
the price, the run and the quality of
the product Sunny and her deputy
editor were about to produce. They
had to choose a run which was big
enough to interest advertisers but
small enough for them to be able to
send them out. They needed a price
that would cover costs while not
being too expensive even for
students to buy and, most of all,
they needed to find a printer who
would give them a good enough
deal for them to afford colour, once
they had decided that it was
necessary. Advertising rates had to
be considered: were they too high
or too low? What incentives should
they give to advertisers? Was it a
good idea to send the magazines out
free? Who should they send it to?
Who did the advertisers want them
to send it to? How heavy could the
magazine be for the postage to be
affordable?
On the subject of money, Sunny
said simply, "I'm not getting paid
at the moment and not really able
to temp enough to make ends meet.
"available from
the IC Bookshop!"
Obviously, this will change should
enough people buy the magazine."
The whole thing might never
have happened had Sunny not been
at Imperial as opposed to almost any
other college. Sunny explained
"It's not just a question of Imperial
having good research projects in
holography, although that is why I
came to IC in the first place. In most
colleges the student newspaper is
run by students in the art faculties,
and they have a tendency to pull
rank over science and engineering
students, and I do not believe there
is any other student newspaper with
the facilities FELIX has. Without
FELIX I would never have gotten
the experience to make Hi happen.
"Not only that, but FELIX staff
will be playing an important role in
her publication in the future, some
of them will be staff writers for Hi,
and, once Hi can afford it, they may
even get paid. And Sunny is not the
only one who owes her career to
experience gained at FELIX. There
are many ex-writers and editors of
FELIX who now have jobs in
science journalism. Pallab Ghosh,
editor in the academic year
beginning 1983 will be working for
New Scientist as of next month.
David Rowe (1984) and Steve
Marshall (1980) are now doing
freelance subediting and writing.
Mike J L Williams (1974) and
Richard Weissenberg (staff, 1984)
are in Advertising and PR. Mark
Smith (1982) is now writing for
publishing company Morgan
Grampian. Since 1985, however,
there has been an explosion of
FELIX staff who have successfully
entered journalism. Of Hugh
Southey's (1985) staff, 7 are now
working for publishing companies
as writers and editors, although
Hugh Southey is not now in
journalism. He is becoming a
lawyer. The success of Imperial
College in turning out that
supposedly rare breed, scientists
who can write, can largely be put
down to the fact that at FELIX
students have a sabbatical editor
who can help them to improve their
skills, as well as access to
professional standard equipment.
Whether Sunny's venture will
actually succeed or not is impossible
to tell, although initial signs are
good. If it does, she will have built
an interesting and challenging
career from almost nothing. Even
if it doesn't she will have fulfilled
on of her ambitions: to be an editor
and publisher before turning 20.
