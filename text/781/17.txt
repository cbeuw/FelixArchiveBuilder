CAREERS CASE STUDY
The Institute of
Chartered
Accountants
requires you to
train, under
contract, with an
authorised training
office of chartered
accountants. During
training you gain
practical experience
and prepare for the
professional exams.
This contract
requires the firm to
provide experience,
training and to
arrange tuition.
The firm will
usually pay all
your tuition fees
for your first
attempt at the
exams and gives
you study leave to
prepare for them
throughout the
contract.
ACCOUNTANCY
Retail & Management
Success in retail management is
immediately visible in the High
Street. The astonishing growth of
groups in various sectors of the
retail market reflects the ambitions,
organisational skills and good
fortune of their senior management
teams and the men and women who
lead them.
Habitat, founded by Terence
Conran, drew its strength from his
background and instincts in design;
Kwikfit-Euro Exhausts grew
rapidly under Tom Farmer and his
hard Scottish leadership; Rymans
was transformed by Jennifer D'Abo
and is now part of the Athena
group, headed by Terry Maher,
whose personal background is
accountancy.
Equally striking have been the
reversals in ailing giants, notably
the turnaround achieved at
Woolworths by Geoff Mulcalvy and
his team. Each of these successful
companies and indeed every
supermarket group, department
store and independent retail chain
relies on its managers and their
skills for the continuing efficiency
of current trading and future
expansion.
There are undoubtedly many
opportunities for those with
management and professional skills
and who can demonstrate their
willingness to use and develop their
talents in the retail sector. Larger
companies such as Sainsburys and
Marks and Spencers have proven
and respected internal management
training schemes, many with
graduate-level entry. Other skills
can be studied externally, leading
to qualifications with professional
organisations, such as the Institute
of Personal Management, IPM, or
the Chartered Institute of
Management Accountants, CIMA.
Experience, training or individual
aptitude in the retail sector will
ultimately lead to specialisation in
such areas as distribution, sales,
marketing, purchasing, market
research, personnel, finance or
administration. These aspects are
similar to those encountered in all
other business organisations. The
pressures for performance and
results do tend to be more intense
and this is reflected in the rewards
and bonuses for those who succeed.
The Pros & Cons of Accounting
So how do you summarise the pros
and cons of a career in accounting
in such a short article? A good start
would be to forget the pros, as they
are dealt with in great detail in the
reams of recruitment literature that
you've no doubt been avidly
studying (or should that be half-
heartedly skimming?).
The first problem to be faced is
that the traditional starting time of
September seems to fall at the start
of the slackest period in the audit
calendar, with the result that the
new graduate may well spend a
depressing proportion of his or her
first few months doing the office
photocopying, filing and other
mundane tasks. Whatever the
various firms' brochures and
adverts may say, everyone I've
spoken to has been through the
same enthusiam-sapping phase (that
should be consoling, but it isn't).
Once you escape from the office
things improve, but only slightly.
For thefirstyear much of the work
is repetitive and dull, but you learn
fast and responsibility should follow
quickly together with more
interesting work. Variety can be a
great help, but unless you are lucky
you may have to push for it.
Possibly the hardest thing to take
is the amount of academic work that
has to be done. Up to 15 hours
studying a week may not sound too
hard, but it can become difficult to
maintain a reasonable social life,
especially when increased
commitments at work start cutting
into evenings and occasionally
weekends. At the end of all this one
faces the prospect of sitting time-
pressured exams for which the pass-
rates are ridiculously low.
This may seem to be a rather
jaundiced view of accountancy, but
I would prefer to think of it as
realisticâ€”after all, most trainees
think fairly seriously about leaving
at some point in their first year.
Some do go, either because they
aren't motivated enough to get
through, or simply because they
realise that they chose the wrong
career, but most stay. You only
have to look at the opportunities
open to qualified chartered
accountants to understand why.
