EMPLOYING YOURSELF
DBSS—how a group
of Imperial students
decided to go it alone
Spot a need,
and fill it: this
is the essence of
starting up your
own business.
The launch of
the DBSS
Liquid Handling
System
illustrates this
option as carried
out by three
students-
Patrick Shaw-
Stewart of IC,
James Duguid
from
Loughborough
University, and
Peter Baldock,
also at IC.
The idea for the business originated
when models of a motorised syringe
device developed by Shaw-Stewart
for his M.Phil, project in
biotechnology were requested by
researchers at Imperial and
Sheffield University. Shaw-Stewart
the DBSS Syringe Drive Unit,
Peristaltic Drive Unit, and
Motorised Valve Unit—controlled
by a computer running the software,
sTALK, which is provided as part
of the package. The hardware can
be linked to almost any computer;
decided to set up a business and
picked as partners an ergonomist,
Duguid, and an electronics expert,
Baldock—who is still working on
his Ph.D. at Imperial.
They decided to form a
partnership rather than a limited
company in order to avoid large
amounts of red tape and the
corresponding waste of time and
money. As long as they were VAT
registered, they believe, their
credibility will not be improved by
their having 'Limited' status.
Starting on a small scale, each
partner contributed an initial £1000.
The aim was to limit the need for
external funding, so that the
fledgling company could grow in its
own time. Duguid and Baldock
went on the Enterprise Allowance
the software should run on any
IBM-compatible microcomputer.
Up to sixty-four devices can be run
from a single PC, and continuous
flow applications can be handled
with varying degrees of accuracy
depending on which of the devices
are used. The whole system has
been highly praised by Dr Dennis
Meader at Imperial: 'This system
outperforms systems from the
mainline manufacturers costing
many times as much,' he says, and
adds that the multi-syringe
configuration allows a greater
experimental flexibility than
possible by any other means. A
recipe for success, they hope.
Scheme, which also provided a
useful source of advice and
information through the
Government's Small Firm Advisory
Service. Shaw-Stewart had a job
and devoted his time after work to
the business.
The product they are making is
a system designed to increase
accuracy, eliminate errors and save
researchers' time in chemical
experiments. Half the sales so far
have been to large industrial
companies, the other half to
universities. The partners prefer a
low key style, depending for sales
on direct approaches to the
customers or on interest generated
by reports in the laboratory press.
The lack of extensive advertising or
'marketing hype' means that the
product can be sold for a quarter to
a third of the price of equivalent
competing products.
As for technical details: the
system comprises three devices—
SELF
EMPLOYMENT
Most graduates at present seem to
want, and eventually enter,
regularly paid employment. But in
the future it is quite possible that
ever more graduates will adopt
alternative occupations rather than
conventional forms of employment.
This is largely due to technology
changes which are beginning to
change the pattern and organisation
of work. So you may start thinking
of 'alternative' work-styles either
because you can't find a job, or
simply because another pattern of
working and living appears more
satisfying.
The main alternative to paid
employment is self-employment,
either as an entrepreneur running
your own business or perhaps as a
member of a cooperative group. An
unemployed graduate mayfindthat
some types of self-employment
require too much capital,
experience or expertise to be
feasible, but there are other types
which require only imagination to
think up a viable idea, and time and
effort to put it into practice. Sources
of information, advice and available
assistance are listed in the
Association of Graduate Careers
Advisory Services booklet 'Self
Employment and Alternative Work
Styles'.
