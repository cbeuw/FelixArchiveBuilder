Rent party
Dear Judith,
Five years ago, when I first arrived in College and
moved into Southside, rent was £25 a week, which for
30 weeks was £750 out of a 1982 £2,000 grant—about
35 %. Nowadays a room in Southside will cost £35 a week,
and with the grant at about £2,300, 30 weeks rent will
take a huge 45 % off the grant. The rise in private residence
is even worse. Every year students are paying an
increasing proportion of their grant for the privilege of
living in Central London. The situation is alleviated
slightly with housing benefit, but plans are well advanced
to remove this benefit from students.
In addition, if this week's London Student is to be
believed, the Government plans to open up the rented
accommodation sector, abolishing fair rents and making
the renting-out of property widespread are going to push
up rents by 200 or 300%. Property currently only rented
out to students to avoid legal hassles will, if the law on
renting is relaxed, be let out at 'market rates' in line with
property values. Living in central London as an
undergraduate (postgraduates can still claim travel back
and so live further out) is going to be impossible.
Accommodation will rise to cost more than the whole
grant. London colleges will increasingly only attract
'affluent' students, never mind the Robbins principle
(higher education for all who will benefit). Market forces
and Thatcherism in higher education by the back door!
What can be done? Arguing with the College is
useless—they have their hands tied by the Government.
What we need is effective London-wide campaigning for
accommodation NOW! As a first step, what do you think
the effect would be if the body representing the students
of the foremost science and engineering college publically
announced that they are actively to discourage new
students from coming to London, because of the
accommodation crisis?
Chris Martin.
Musical rooms
Dear Judith,
We would like to draw attention to the lack of
communication between the communication experts.
Imagine our surprise, having booked the music room, in
writing, last July, to be told, on our return to College,
that there was no record of this. We were informed that
this was due to the change of control in 53, Prince's Gate.
No one on the new Management Sciences staff had thought
to enquire whether there were any standing bookings.
However, they were very helpful and agreed to honour
our reservation. Unfortunately, this did not resolve the
problems caused by the departmental switch as we were
told, one working day before the rehearsal, that the room
had been double booked. Fortunately, on this occasion,
the club which had booked the only Union room containing
a piano was willing to let us take over use of it. We
consider that severe disruption was caused to our Freshers'
event due to this gross error on the part of Management
Science.
ICOS wonders whether the transfer of the Humanities
Department to the Mechanical Engineering building is in
the interest of I C U students or merely to further Imperial
College's financial ambitions. The lucrative industrial
connections of Management Science may create revenue
to fill the gap left in their budget when I C U regained
control of the profits from the Harlington gravel. Part of
the reorganisation has involved the removal of one practice
piano from general use and of two others to the Sherfield
Building. It will also include the refurbishment of the
Music Room during the spring term, resulting in total
exclusion of all users. It is unlikely that student societies
will ever regain full use of this facility as Management
Science have let it be known that they do not welcome
student use of this room during office hours; extending
until ten in the evening.
Work on the building appears already to be in progress,
as we discovered to our cost when we went to make some
coffee for the rehearsal and found that our whole store
cupboard had vanished. Although this may seem trivial
in the face of all the points above, the loss of a valuable
urn could be seen as a financial disaster to a College
society.
Yours sincerely,
ICOS Committee 1987/88
G Sturck (Chairman), M Lucking (Treasurer),
G Turner (Secretary), P Murphy (Publicity Officer).
Council chaos
Dear Judith,
I would like to reply to your editorial in F E L I X 780
concerning the cancellation of last Monday's Council
Meeting. That Monday I walked into the Union Office
to enquire whether the notifications and agendae for the
meeting had been sent out, and was told by Chas Jackson
(ICU Hon Sec) that he had not yet had time to print and
distribute them. In view of this, and knowing that very
few Council members would turn up as a result, I asked
the three executive members for their opinions. Having
heard what they had to say I, as Council Chairman,
decided to postpone Council until the following Monday.
In the light of the recent "Not the Freshers' U G M " fiasco,
I hope you will agree that it was more sensible to postpone
the meeting until everyone knew about it, rather than have
another inquorate, unrepresentative meeting.
I take full responsibility for this decision, and I apologise
profoundly to those that had already set the evening aside
for this meeting (I'm included in this category).
Yours,
Alastair J Seymour, ICU Council Chairman.
Wet and dry
Dear Judith,
I would like to pour out gems of wisdom to your readers
like the sky is currently pouring out water, but I can't.
I can, however, give out one pearl: I have noticed that
when I press the little silver button near the handle of my
umbrella that it springs open and covers me thus,
miraculously, keeping me in a state of dryness even when
it is raining. I hope your readers find this information
useful and perhaps use it themselves.
Yours,
A no-longer wet ex-physicist.
FELIX Friday October 23rd 1987 35
