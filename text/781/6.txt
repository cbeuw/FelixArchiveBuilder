Galileo was
wrong
Not content with already having two
more forces than the average mind
can understand, some physicists are
looking for another one. If they find
it, Galileo's proof that heavy and light
objects fall at the same rate will be
shown to have been wrong.
The search started when a physicist
called Fishbach looked at the original
experimental data collected in 1923
by another physicist called Eotvos,
who had been doing delicate tests of
the equivalence o f inertial and
gravitational mass. Eotvos thought he
had demonstrated, within
experimental accuracy, that
gravitational and inertial mass were
the same (implying that all bodies fall
with equal accelerations), but when
his data were reexamined they
showed significant statistical
irregularities, suggesting that there
was a small residual mass-dependent
acceleration.
Fishbach does not say that
conventional theories of gravity are
God and
slugs
Biologists have been driven to
religion by attempts to find out why
slugs don't eat moss.
Slugs seem to happily munch
anything useful that we try to grow
in our gardens, but they never seem
to touch moss. Rather than just
ascribing this to Sod's law or the
general perversity of nature, two
biologists proposed that mosses
contain chemical nasties that the slugs
avoid.
To test this, they extracted some of
the chemicals from moss. However,
slugs don't eat liquids, so the
researchers had to find some solid to
smear the chemicals on. The slugs
proved very fussy and rejected almost
everything the scientists tried, until
they used the wafers specially
designed for use in the Christian
communion service: the slugs gobbled
them up, along with all the moss
extracts.
It is not clear whether this is
because the religious nature of the
wafers protects the slugs from harm,
or whether the chemicals are not the
noxious bits in mosses after all.
(New Scientist 15/10/87 p 25).
wrong as such; rather, he proposes a
new, short-range repulsive force
dependent on the nuclear density of
the interacting objects. T h e
implication is that denser objects fall
ever so slightly more slowly: that is,
in a vaccuum, feathers fall faster than
cannonballs.
The results from some of the other
experiments are n o w i n .
Measurements of gravity in mine
shafts support Fishbach's hypothesis
as do some other experiments using
Newspaper headlines recently
proclaimed that scientists had
discovered that the entire human race
was descended from a single African
female. T h e headlines were
sensationalist, but they did contain an
element of truth.
The raw evidence that led to the
claim was based on a study of
mitochondrial D N A . Mitochondria
are rod shaped blobs that exist inside
ordinary cells and contain enzymes
important for energy supply: they are
the cellular equivalent of the power
station. In this case the important
thing is that the D N A contained in
them has certain unique properties. It
is a sort of relic from the past and
contributes nothing to the cell as a
whole, and it is transmitted from
generation to generation only through
females. Because it is not involved in
mainstream genetic processes and the
main changes are just random
mutation, it can be used to trace and
time (if we know the mutation rate)
the line of female descent.
The techniques needed to compare
the D N A from different individuals
have just recently been applied to this
area. When the D N A from a wide
range of people was tested it was
found to be much more alike than had
been expected.
The scientists who did the study
were surprised, and proposed that one
explanation for the low variation
could be that everyone is descended
terrestrial gravity. However, some
carefully controlled pure laboratory
experiments have found no
unexpected forces. The definitive
experiment will probably require the
gravitational wave detector at C E R N ,
but until that experiment is done, the
jury is out. Until there is a really good
proof of the new force, people will
be justifiably sceptical of it: after all,
four forces are more than we can cope
with.
(Nature 328 p578)
from a single female living about
200,000 years ago. Presumably the
human population was having a bad
time at the hunts and had virtually
died out. They warned that other
more complex scenarios could explain
the D N A patterns, but the editor o f
the paper left that bit out and hence
the sensational new headlines.
Recent work has gone into enough
detail to give a good idea of the family
tree. This places the ancestral Eve in
Africa. The most important fact is that
modem homo sapiens appears to have
arisen in just one place and then
spread out, completely replacing any
other competing species. That is,
humanity did not arise in lots of places
at once.
There is much discussion on the
validity of the data. Both the actual
value and constancy of the mutation
rate, have been questioned. If the
mutation rate is not reliably constant
then the family trees simply cannot be
trusted.
On the other hand, much of the
criticism may come from colleagues,
jealous that they didn't think up work
that could make front page headlines
in the newspapers.
The strange thing is that all the
writers have failed to notice that the
biblical allusion is wrong: the humam
race is more directly descended from
Noah's wife than from E v e ,
according to the account in Genesis.
(Science 238 p24).
An appreciation
of Sir Peter
Medawar
Not many people who win Nobel
Prizes are better known for doing
something else; Peter Medawar, who
died earlier this month, was one of
those few.
He is best known for his sagacious
contributions to the popular
communication of science; indeed, he
has been called the best science writer
of his generation. He did not write
huge numbers of books (unlike some
modern writers such as Paul Davies
or Isaac Asimov) but when he wrote,
he said wise things that showed great
insight into the methods and
implications of Science. He was a
man who was capable of excellence
in a specific field (immunology), but,
when he wrote about more general
issues, was no less brilliant. He cared
about science as a whole and he cared
about how it was used: he showed
little mercy to those who abused it.
He thought deeply about how science
works and how it affects the world:
his vision was broad in contrast to the
average specialist who sees only his
or her own narrow branch o f the
scientific tree.
His greatest achievements were his
writings. His descriptions of the
scientific character stand against the
usual charicatures. His explanations
of how science is done, and his hints
on how to do it better, have both
helped scientists with their work and
have educated many non-scientists in
the ways of science. Few scientists
have ever matched his ability to think
clearly and to communicate ideas
simply and without obfiiscation.
The world needs more people like
Peter Medawar. Unfortunately a
scientific education (especially of the
sort given at Imperial College) will
not encourage people to be like him.
W e tend to want blinkered
conservative conformists: they do
what they are told, they don't ask
questions, they don't rock the boat.
There is no hope for science and little
hope for the country as long as that
is the sort of person our institutions
produce.
Editor's Bit
Next week this space will contain,
among other things, a look at what
work won Nobel prizes this year (was
D a v i d C a p l i n o f the Physics
Department right when he said it was
the fastest physics prize ever?).
