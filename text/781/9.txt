HOW TO GET
A CAREER
It's that time of year again, when
a student's fancy turns lightly to
thoughts of a job. The large firms
hover over College at the Careers
Fair, throwing out lures for the
anxious students who have suddenly
realised that, in nine months they
will no longer be part of the
sheltered college life. Notices
appeal with anxious hints that it's
time to start hunting, or reassuring
messages of the sort, 'it's later than
you think'.
Don't panic. If you concentrate
on one step at a time, common
sense and a bit of application
(effort, I mean) should give you a
fair chance of winning a job and/or
starting a career. And to make it
easier, there are people able to
advise you on every step of the way.
The Careers Advisors, while they
can't tell you what to do, can point
you in the right direction to get
started, test whether you're being
realistic and otherwise generally
help you.
Stage one in the job hunt is
deciding what type of work you
want. If you don't already know
what you're aiming for, there's an
article further on in this issue which
should give you some ideas on how
to choose. So let's move on to the
next stages.
The autumn and spring terms
should be taken up with yet more
research. The indexes of the
graduate recruitment directories
(ROGET, GET, GO and numerous
others) are usually easily available
sources. A visit to the Careers
Information room should be well
worthwhile. The University of
London Careers Service offers a
wide range of publications including
the 'matrices'—folders of computer
printed vacancy news which give
important information on
employers' requirements and are
regularly updated. 'Employment
requirement forms'; the fortnightly
lists, 'Forward Vacancies';
'Recruitment Update' and 'Careers
Extra'—all these should be
available either in College or at the
University of London. The London
University's Central Careers Office
can be found at 50 Garden Square,
London WC1.
The result of your investigations
should be a comprehensive list of
possible employers. Their
recruitment literature is important
reading, most of the big companies
are represented in the College
Careers room collection, but if you
can't find information on any
particular employer try writing
directly to them.
When you have as much
information as you can scrape
together, you can start narrowing
the field. Compare the pros and
cons of the names on yourfirstlist,
and pick out the most promising.
About a dozen would be a
reasonable number for a first
attempt.
It would be wise to include some
small or lesser-known employers on
your short-list; the competition for
most of the well-known 'giants' will
be fierce so having some back-up
is a good idea.
If any of your short-listed
employers are taking part in the
Careers Fair (see the list on page
26) applying for an interview will
be relatively easy. If not, use each
employer's preferred format (their
own application form, standard
application form, or CV with
covering letter are the most usual)
to apply directly to them. The
College Careers room has
application forms for many
companies on file.
Some employers keep a low
profile (including some of those
graduates might find most
interesting) so if you want a job
with them you'll have to make a
speculative approach directly to
them. Names and addresses can be
found in the various directories.
There are also the information
booklets produced by the
Association of Graduate Careers
Advisory Services—look for the
vast collection in the College
which should help
Careers room-
you track down employers.
If you can spare the time from
revising during the summer term
you can start applying for jobs that
require you to be immediately
available for work. This is because
many employers are willing to wait
two or three months for the right
candidate. Otherwise you can wait
until after the exams before
applying again.
The good news is that you can
still use the College careers facilities
after you graduate. Under a 'mutual
aid' system you may even be able
to use those of any other university
of polytechnic if that would be more
convenient. Public reference
libraries should also have some of
the sources of information you
might need. For information on
employers try trade directories (eg
'Who Owns Whom'), Extel cards,
the Yellow Pages, professional
associations and institutions (listed
in the 'Directory of British
Associations', published by CBD
Research) and, of course, company
recruitment brochures and annual
reports. 'Current Vacancies' and
'Job Opportunities Bulletin', are
useful publications telling you of
vacancies; the 'Graduate-Employer
Matching Register' is a computer-
assisted register which sends your
details to employers with vacancies
to fill. Many employers now recruit
at summer fairs; national or local
newspapers and specialist journals
(Nature and New Scientist for
example) carry advertisements for
jobs. Then there are the local Job
Centres for 'non-professional' and
'non-managerial' jobs if you need
to earn your bread while you're
looking for something more to your
taste. And then there are the private
employment agencies.
Another point to remember is that
many jobs aren't advertised.
Treasure your contacts—friends,
relatives or people you meet
through leisure interests or part-
time work. It's surprising how often
graduatesfindjobs through contacts
they have made for themselves, and
though these people may not be able
to get you a job, they may put you
in touch with someone who can
help. They may even be able to get
you an interview.
But once you've obtained an
invitation to an interview, it's all up
to you. Read on to learn how to
cope.
Good hunting.
