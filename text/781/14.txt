AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF
WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN
YOUR PROSPECTIVE
EMPLOYER
"How do I choose
which employer to
apply to? They all
seem much the
same to me. I'll
apply to the seven
largest, most
famous employers
with the most
It might work but, if you have
spent any time at all choosing what
occupation you wish to follow, it
seems a pity to mess up your future
happiness by failing to carry out
adequate research on your
prospective employer. There are
five Directories of Employers of
graduates. 'Register of Graduate
Employment and Training'
(ROGET); 'Graduate Employment
and Training' (GET); 'Graduate
Opportunities' (GO); 'Directory of
Opportunities' (DOG) and
'Directory of Opportunities in New
Technology' (DONT). These are a
good source for your preliminary
vacancies and that
will probably
do."
list of possible employers. Besides
outlining the vacancies that they
may have, they tell you about the
company's size, its location, its
pattern of employment and even a
little of its philosophy. Many
employers produce special
Graduate brochures which provide
profiles of recent graduate entrants
of the 'Day in the life of...' variety.
There are many videos for those
who prefer watching and listening
to reading. These can be viewed in
the Careers Video Room, key from
Sherfield Room 309. Although all
these sources will tell you
something of the companies, they
are produced and written by the
employers themselves and therefore
are unlikely to paint the companies
in anything other than glowing
terms. The same thing can be said
of the recent graduates brought
along to Company presentations. A
company is unlikely to bring along
people who think it's a foul
company in which to work! So how
can you find out which company is
for you? Firstly you must know
what you want from an employer;
What sort of environment would
you enjoy? What promotion
prospects or training would suit you
best? Do you want a very open,
friendly style of management or
would you prefer a more
conservative formal firm? The
Careers Fair is a good place to start.
You might ask them why they think
you should work for them rather
than for X and Co although don't
sound too arrogant when doing so!
Another valuable way of finding out
about different employers is at the
Old Students' Association and
Careers evening.
Once you have narrowed the field
of employers you can save everyone
an awful lot of time by checking
whether the companies actually
have vacancies in the areas for
which you are applying. Every
year, a well known computing
company is inundated with
applications for computer
programming jobs. They do have
between 400 and 500 vacancies but
not for computer programmers.
If the company is visiting the
campus during the Graduate
Recruitment programme then you
can obtain the application forms
from the Careers library. Otherwise
you will have to apply directly to
the company.
Aridfinally,think about 'fall back
positions'. Please consider the
wisdom of only applying to the big,
glamourous, well-known
companies. Every year on the
Imperial Graduate Recruitment
Programme, perfectly respectable
companies have to cancel their visits
through lack of applications. Think
what it would do to your chances
of success if you applied to such a
company.
JOBS FOR THE
BOYS (& GIRLS)
There are many job opportunities
for graduates who do not want to
continue in their chosen discipline.
These jobs are open to people who
are not only academically sound but
who also possess special personal
qualities. If you are in your final
year you must begin to think about
life after University. You must
begin to ask yourself 'what do I
want from a job or from life?' and
'what do I have to offer a
company?' There are endless
careers pamphlets in the College
Careers Library on Level 3 of the
Sherfield Building, which offer all
sorts of information and advice. We
hope to give you a rough guide to
which direction you should be
taking.
You—what do you want?
• Do you want to feel involved,
stretched, excited, useful?
• How important is pay,
geographical location, security?
• In what way do you want to deal
with people—do you want to
advise, teach, organise or entertain
them?
• Do you want a job overseas?
• Do you have foriegn languages?
Do you want to use them?
• Do you want a routine 9—5 job?
Would you object to shift hours?
• Do you want further
qualifications?
• Do you want to do something
'socially useful'?
You—what can you offer?
• Are you a leader?
• Can you work in a team?
• Are you a good organiser?
• Are you creative?
• Are you committed to solving all
problems?
• Can you work to a deadline?
• Are you a sympathetic listener?
• Are you confident in public?
• Can you express yourself clearly?
By answering all these questions
you may begin to see which jobs
you are suited to and which you'd
have no hope of doing.
