Windy races
The first round of the City and Guilds
Motor Club championship tookplace
last Saturday (17th October) in a gale-
devastated Essex.
The six crews that entered the
Country Treasure Hunt were faced
with fallen trees and minor floods
along large sections of the 35 mile
route from powerless Billercay to
South Woodham Ferrers. A t one
point the two leading crews had to
wait for workmen to remove a tree
before continuing.
The object of the event was to
answer questions about buildings
' along the route and collect 'treasure'
such as apples, hay, brambles,.dririks
cans and an 'original item' as a
tie-breaker.
The first crew to finish, only two
minutes late, were the eventual
winners Dave Hobbs and Adrian
Bourne in a Mini 1000, with a traffic
cone as their original piece o f
Christianity and Sex
There are two Love-Gods in the world
today: Emmanuel - one of Jesus'
names meaning 'God with us' - and
"Emmanuelle" - a twentieth century
substitute for the real thing.
You can't shock God over anything to
do with sex. He invented it! Emmanuel
knows how sex works best and he gave
us the maker's instructions -
unparalleled enjoyment of sex within a
relationship of unconditional
commitment.
'I have come in order that you might have life - life
in all its fullness'John 10:10
The aim of "Emmanuelle"-sex is the
opposite - "Get what you can, take what
you want, gratify your sexual urges now.
And don't thinktoofar ahead. Continue
the liaison for only as long as it is
enjoyable."
But instant kicks have long-term
kick-backs; and everyone loses out.
Emmanuel comestoset us free from
the deception of "Emmanuelle" and the
debasement of God's gifts.
A series of events in
week eight, Nov 23-28
organised by Imperial
College Christian Union 8
treasure.
Four more crews arrived during the
next fifty minutes, the only non-
finisher being the Citroen GS of Max
Kallios and Henry Taylor whose
hydraulic suspension failed.
Second was the M G Midget of
Mike Putts and Club Captain Jon
Stout with the late-starting 'Team
Guilds' of Murray Williamson, Dave
Osborne, Nigel Street and Guilds
President Dave Tyler a fine third.
Messrs Hobbs and Bourne head the
championship table on twenty points
each, with Putts, Stout, organisers
