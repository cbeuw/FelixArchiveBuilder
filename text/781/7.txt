in Norman's
3. What do you think of the
food in Norman's?
"It's very nice, that's
why I'm eating here. It's
better than over in the
JCR. The service is really
good and friendly
—Jacqueline Godfrey
"I very rarely eat here,
it's not too bad, it's not
cheap but it's not
expensive, it's OK. The
service is a bit slow and
the tables are always
covered in shit. I
wouldn't go out of my
way to come into College
to eat here, but yeah, it's
OK"-Rob Conn
"It's crap! I wanted a
veggie samosa. It was on
the board; I got my
samosa and it wasn't
vegetarian, so I'm not
going to come here
again. I took it back and
I got a very bad
response"
—Dominic Stead
•
"It's rabbit food!"
—Patrick Thomas
"It's not good value for
money but myfriendpaid
for it"
—Matthew Holmes
"The burger? For what
it is it's ******
expensive. I could get the
same sort of thing
cheaper in
MacDonalds''
—Dean Miller
"/ eat at the bar because I think the proportion of veggie stuff
is awful. The beefburgers taste horrible over there and I think
if the Union had their heads screwed on they'd supply a similar
service to QT and make a lot of money which they 're making
over there. You've only got to see the comparison in the queues.
They obviously offer a better package which everybody likes,
because more people use it"—Keith Wiggins
' 'It's fantastic! I love it!
I have two plates of it
every day. It's a lot better
than Linstead food"
—Leszek Bartoszewsk
"I'm usually over in
Belushi's. It's nearer to
the Mech Eng Building,
you see—you don't have
to walk so far. I like my
animal fats. The veggie
food is OKfor a change
—Dominic Strowbridge
"The staff are very
friendly—they give very
good portions
—Louise Cameron
"It's preferable to QT.
You have to time it
properly for the queues
otherwise you have to
wait half an hour"
