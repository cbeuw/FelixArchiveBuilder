CAREERS FAIR
The Imperial College Careers Fair,
taking place on Tuesday 27th October
and Wednesday 28th October, is one
of the largest events of its kind in the
U K . It is an opportunity to meet the
representatives of 100 companies in
the informal setting of the Great Hall
and J C R . There are accountancy
firms, pharmaceutical producers,
small business advisory services,
government departments, mining
engineers, software houses...all
degree courses are represented.
To offer students the most variety
50 different organisations are
participating each day. It is therefore
definitely worthwhile coming on both
the Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Fair offers final year students
the ability to begin the 'milk-round'
by collecting all their literature from
one convenient location. Many of the
organisations offer vacation work-
experience and so first and second
year students are also invited to
attend. Also providing advice and
information will be the Careers
Advisory Service.
