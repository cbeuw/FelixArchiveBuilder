Howlong
beforethe
milkround
turns sour?
There's one thing a spell at University
always guarantees. Plenty of'milkround'
visits from company executives.
Each and every one of them has
well-paid jobs to offer.
But before signing on the dotted line,
think very carefully.
Will the promises turn out to be
empty? Will the job suit your particular
abilities and skills?
These are not the sort of questions
you can answer in 3 minutes. So why not
take 3 years to decide your future - as
an Army Officer?
On completion of your training at
Sandhurst you will be commissioned as
a Lieutenant earning ,Â£11,074.
Naturally you will learn how to
command and care for a group of bright
young soldiers and to handle our
sophisticated weapons and equipment.
And if you are posted abroad at short
notice to lead soldiers in unfamiliar
surroundings you'd have to cope.
No wonder many leading industri-
alists regard an Army Commission as
the best management training a young
man or woman can have.
Whether you make the Army your
long-term career or leave earlier is up to
you.
Either way it promises not to sour
your future. Quite the opposite in fact.
And you'll gain unrivalled executive
training at our expense.
So if you need a little more time to
decide, see your Careers Staff and pick
up an Introduction Form.
Through this we will arrange for a
Liaison Officer to see you at your
University, Polytechnic, or College of
Higher Education.
