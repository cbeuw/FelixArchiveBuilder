C a r e e r s
A POSTGRADUATE COURSE
(BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE SURE)
You're finishing
your first degree.
You've enjoyed
your chosen
subject, done
fairly well in all
your exams and
you're on for a
reasonably good
degree. Your first
few years at
University have
been intellectually
stimulating and
enjoyable, so
you'd like to
spend some more
time at college.
You certainly
don't feel ready to
start a job quite
yet, so you think
about doing a
postgraduate
course. Why not,
you think?
Well, one very good reason for
not doing a postgraduate degree is
that you can't think of anything
better. Once the PG money has run
out, you are going to be in exactly
the same situtation again, but, (if
you're lucky) with an extra
qualification of dubious value, or
without one (if you're not). In this
case, to have tried and failed is
worse than to have never have tried
at all.
One even worse reason for doing
a PhD is falling prey to flattery.
You may feel that you're immune,
but come July and the degree results
are out, and famous professors ask
if you would like to do a degree
with them; it is all too easy to
become overwhelmed by pride.
Professors have reasons of their
own for wanting PhD students,
some of which are not at all
attractive.
If you have enjoyed yourself as
an undergraduate, consider whether
the things you have enjoyed will
continue as a PG. Postgraduate life
is many miles away from that of
undergraduates; most of the
suprises are pleasant, but be ready
for some shocks. Think, for
example, whether you could live for
another three years on the money
you get at the moment (a PG grant
is no more per week than an
undergradute gets), especially when
it comes to accommodation; how
much has accommodation risen in
the last three years, and what nasty
shocks have HM Government got
in store? You can say bye bye now
to housing benefit.
Before you get the idea that I am
dead set against PG's, there are
some positive reasons why you
should continue.
Perhaps you have some special
interest gained as an undergraduate,
and you want to continue in this
field. Many a Masters course caters
for this need (eg Astrophysics).
The most obvious choice is
vocational; you actually need the
qualification for your chosen
career. You may feel it will be
easier to get a job with the extra
letters after your name. You may
want to change to another field (eg
Information Technology). Beware,
however, as admissions tutors can
be prone to exaggerate how
vocational their courses are. Be sure
to ask what their previous scholars
are now doing; whether they have
jobs and in which areas. You could,
of course, ask the employers in your
chosen field (Careers Fair is a good
time for this), or talk to a careers
advisor.
The important thing when
deciding about postgraduate study
is to have positive reasons for
staying at university. Enjoying the
atmosphere is not enough, and is
unlikely to provide enough
motivation to get you through the
course. Not only is this a waste of
your time, but it stops someone who
is interested in taking your place.
If you are thinking about a PG
course, then there are two things
that will really help you. The first
is to get hold of a copy of the
'Postgraduate Handbook'. This is a
booklet produced by postgraduates
at IC that gives advice and
information about postgraduate life.
Obviously what is written is biased
towards life at IC, but much of it
applies to other places as well. It is
due to be published before
Christmas, but for those in a hurry
there are plenty of copies of last
year's edition available (free!) in the
IC Union office. Last year's edition
contains information on courses,
choosing a supervisor, money as a
PG, and personal views of PG life
from all sides of the fence. It also
contains useful information on life
as a woman PG, and life as an
overseas PG at Imperial.
Secondly, you must get about and
ask current PG's, preferably in your
chosenfield,about PG life. Sit them
down, buy them a burger or a few
drinks. You will learn more like this
than by reading a hundred books.
OK, so you have your heart set
on a PG course. What courses are
available? The Careers Office in
Sherfield keeps a reference copy of
'Graduate Studies', which lists all
the PhD, Masters and many of the
Diploma courses available in the
UK. They also have information on
studying abroad. Ask around in
your department. Consider whether
you want to stay here, or move
away.
The timetable: you can leave it
really late (June even), but don't be
surprised if you ending up taking an
enforced year out! To be safe, start
making enquiries now. For most
PhD's and Masters, the prudent
apply around Christmas, but for
many vocational courses like
teaching, you will need to apply
now. The main deadlines are those
to do with applying for grants: see
the Careers service and PG
Handbook for more details.
One last bit of advice; being a PG
can be great, and if you think you
may be even remotely interested,
apply. If you get an offer of a place,
you can always turn it down, and
it may well save you waiting a year
because you dithered for too long.
