Taig Over
Christine Taig
Jackie Pierce
Dave Co Iley
Christine Taig will be next year's Imperial College Union
President. She beat J Martin Taylor after reallocation of
the other three candidates votes. Jackie Pierce is the
new Deputy President and Dave Colley is the new
Honorary Secretary.
The election for
President was close.
Before reallocation Ms
Taig had 566 votes, Mr
Taylor had 332 votes, Chris
Stapleton had 192 votes,
James O'Shea had 121
votes and Paul Merckx
(aka Dobbin) had 90 votes.
Mr Merckx was thus
eliminated. After the
second reallocation Mr
O'Shea was eliminated and
Mr Stapleton was
eliminated after the third.
The final reallocation left
Mr Taylor with 476 votes
and Ms Taig with 681
votes.
Ms Taig told FELIX last
night that she was
'resonably surprised' with
the result. She added that
she did not think in a years
time people would think
they made the wrong
choice. She said she was
dissapointed with the low
turn-out bearing in mind
the work put into publicity
by the candidates.
Ms Pierce won the
election for Deputy
President comfortably. She
received 967 votes while
Paul Shanley received 164
votes. The election for
Honorary Secretary was
won in an equally
comfortable way. Mr Colley
received 825 votes
compared with Michael
Newman's 280 votes.
Ms Pierce told FELIX
that she was 'over the
moon, John'. She looked
forward to 'a good working
Union next year'. Mr Colley
said he felt 'really good'.
He said that 'I now have to
get down to doing the
things I promised in my
manifesto'.
New Sabbaticals
Christine Taig may be the
best thing to happen to this
Union in years. She has a lot
of ideas about how the Union
should be changed. If she
manages to implement them
then Imperial College Union
may become relevant to
average students. She lacks
experience, though. The
performance of people like
Roger Preece who have been
elected to posts when they
have little experience of the
Union shows that you need
more than ideas, you also
need a lot of ability and
support. Christine seems to
have the enthusiasm and
ability necessary to implement
her ideas; I hope I'm right.
Dave Jones must make sure
that FELIX next year forces
Christine to keep her
promises. If she does he must
praise herand if she doesn't
he must attack.
Jackie Pierce and Dave
Colley were always likely to
win their elections as the
standard of the opposition
was very low. It is sad that a
union as big as ours can only
provide one decent candidate
for 3 out of it's 4 sabbatical
posts. If Jackie and Dave
don't succeed it will be
difficult to criticise because it
is very unlikely that their
opponents could have done
any better.
