A Complaint
I Dear Hugh,
II read with interest Luke
I Walkers opinion article on
academic affairs. Relieved,
I as I am, that there is
| someone on the Guilds
I Exec who claims to
I represent students, I am
| left with one question, what
I has he actually achieved?
1 What have any of the
| Academic Affairs Officers
achieved? There are still
irrelevent courses, lecturers
who can't communicate,
I and staff promoted because
I of research rather than
I teaching. Has no-one
I noticed that all these
I committees that our
I 'representatives' sit on only
I function to keep the
| students quiet. Year after
I year the Union has asked
I for lecturers to go on
1 communication courses,
I and what has happened?-
1 NOTHING.
1 Carl Burgess and Luke
|| Walker are away this week,
at a conference in Belgium
which is being paid for by
the Union, but I'm sure
they'll reply to this letter
just as soon as they get
back.
Pete Wilson
An apology
Thanks to Luke Walker for
setting me straight on my
misgivings about the
student quesitonnaire that
I he, Carl and others went to
I a lot of the trouble to
organise. My greatest
reason for complaint was
the conviction that I had
not been sent the results of
the first questionnaire. In
fact I had been sent them
in good time, but had 'filed'
them in such a
disorganised fashion that it
was only when I came to
check for the third time,
last Saturday, that I found
them, I feel that while my
critiscism that the
questionnaire was biased is
still valid, this alone does
not justify my Opinion of
two weeks ago. I made this
| objection known, at a
meeting of the
Undergraduate Studies
Committee working group
on Student Needs, and
I should have let it rest.there.
I I would, however like to
1 state that the reason I don't
go to some meetings is
because I am not told (or
at least I don't think I am!)
that they are going on.
Also, it is quite true that I
did receive a copy of the
second quesitionnaire
before it was circulated to
Dep Reps, but only in fact
about one hour before.
This was apparently
invevitable due to the
shortage of the time before
the next working group
meeting.
Luke is also correct to
say that he does more work
towards Academic Affairs
which I appreciate is very
constructive. Most of what I
do is talk to students and
think, trying to isolate more
fundamental problems
which cannot be
immediately tackled. If you
think, this sounds ill-
defined and waffley, that's
because it is! There should
be an example of this
elsewhere in this week's
FELIX (and others in
previous issues).
Finally I would like to say
that Jane Ryder has had
nothing at all to do with my
opinion of Luke.
With sincere apologies to
Luke and Carl

A Correction
Dear Hugh,
Although not wishing to be
petty I think I should
correct a small point in the
news item refering to me
last week, which may have
arisen from a
misunderstanding between
myself and the news staff. I
did not deny being involved
with the removal of the
Gestetner, my complaint
was about the abusive
treatment I received from
Carl Burgess. It was later
brought to my attention
that Carl was under
considerable pressure at
the time and the matter
now appears to have been
settled amicably. I suppose
I should thank all the
people who seemed intent
on taking my case to heart,
but I would rather they
took a more rational
attitude, especially in view
of the number of potential
crises facing the Union at
the present time.
Thank you

Technology not
the Problem
Dear Sir,
This may seem like a
contradition but I agree
with most of the points
raised by Peter Heap
(letter's last FELIX) and
Mark Field (Opinion, FELIX
before). However I do feel
that Peter has missed the
esence of Mark's article.
There is no doubt that
certain aspects of
technology have been
applied in a destructive
manner. Technology has
developed in to a tool
which has the power to
destroy the world, if not by
a big bang then by slow
erosion. However this tool
is not self-determining, it
has no mind of its own.
Decisions as to what
shall be done with
technology are made by
society. For far too long
. scientist and engineers
have distanced themselves
from such decisions, being
unaware and unconcerned
as to the consequences of
their action. All too often
the pathetic a cry 'Oh, thats
politics, I'm apolitical' is
heard and accepted as the
normal way to think,
especially here. This
attitude is not only
dangerous but naive.
Politics is about people
(not just political parties)
and without any interest in
people, what point can
there be?
My point is that yes,
technology has been used
destructively but that is a
condemnation of the user
not the tool itself. It is up to
you what you do with the
knowledge and skills that
you aquire here (or attempt
to anyway). You don't have
to follow the example of
the legions of morons who
are only concerned with
their own little world.
Technology has the power
to change the world, are
Y O U going to let it be part
of the problem or part of
the solution?

You are
the solution
Dear Hugh,
Peter Heap (last week's
letters) wrote about the use
of technology to 'deprive
millions of their jobs and
make their lives
purposeless', to 'pollute
and destroy the
environment, kill people
and cause other nefarious
effects'. He was making the
point that 'technology is a
bad thing'.
He seems to view
technology as something
which has its own
momentum, the results of
which are inevitable.
I disagree with this.
Technology is not
autonomous or neutral, it is
directed by the values of
society. Factories were not
created because
technology demanded
them, factories were
created to control people
and their work, and the
technology developed to
strengthen this control.
Technology has been
developed in such a way as
to take power away from
people (both in capitalist
and communist countries).
It has been directed to
make weapons. It has
largely been controlled by
people that will not feel the
effects of resource
depletion or pollutions.
Technology itself is not a
bad thing. It is a useful
tool.
As scientists and
engineers we must use that
tool in appropriate ways
which can lead to greater
quality of life for people,
without pollution or over-
exploitation of resources.
Our Technology and our
way of life must not
jeopardise future
generations or continue the
ruthless exploitation of the
Third World which we have
left underdeveloped.
Scientists and Engineers
hold real powers. I have
heard many IC students
say that politics and world
affairs have nothing to do
with them. I think that this
is ridiculously naive.
I agree with Mark Field
that Technologists are
'essential members of
society'. We must use our
education appropriately!
Yours,
