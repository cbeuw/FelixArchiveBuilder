DOCTOR
THE WEEKLY NEWSPAPER FOR
THE FAMILY PRACTITIONER
Where vaccinations are recommended by DHSS,
but are not mandatory, this is indicated by capital R.
Smallpox vaccination is now only required for
Kampuchea and Chad. It is recommended that in
the UK the vaccination should be given only to staff
working on smallpox virus, their families, those en-
gaged in vaccine manufacture, and hospital staff
dealing with patients suspected of having the
disease, although WHO has declared the world
smallpox free.
Although cholera and yellow fever vaccination is
not often mandatory (except for passengers leaving
or transiting an infected area) DHSS advises it for
tropical areas of Africa and Asia wherever there is
an outbreak.
Travellers to these areas are advised also be vac-
cinated against typhoid. Children under one year
are generally exempt. Gamma globulin is suggested
for travellers visiting countries where hepatitis is a
risk.
Rabies can develop as long as two years after
infection, so it is wise to remind travellers to seek
advice immediately if bitten or scratched in a rabies
area.
Malaria is increasing in areas where cholorquine-
resistant strains of P falciparum have been identified.
These areas are SE Asia and the N Eastern region of
the Indian sub-continent; Eastern Africa, especially
coastal areas; areas of South and Central America;
Western Oceania. Seek advice for alternative proph-
ylaxis.
