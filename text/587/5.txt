Dear Sieve
W h a t a disappointment lor those
of us w h o were beginning to
think that I C C N D was not just
the latest front for the same old
bunch of commies! I refer to their
article i n last week's F E L I X ,
which publicises I C C N D partici-
p a t i o n i n t h e u n e m p l o y m e n t
march.
T h e writer attempts to establish
a link between nuclear disarma-
ment and unemployment, but all
he comes up with is the fact that
the arms industries that C N D
seeks t o d e s t r o y a r e l a b o u r -
intensive!
I wish O w e n "the Conscience"
G r e e n e a n d his m e r r y b a n d
would stop bothering the S C C
with a succession o f " n e w " and
" r a d i c a l " clubs and societies and
register themselves once and for
all cither as a charity for the
intellectually handicapped or as

Sir
English is the language of the
people of Prittan (that's not a
Welsh pronunciation, but the
L a t i n for " c h a l k " — t h e root of
the name o f these islands). It is a
l a n g u a g e w h o s e s y n t a x has
always been governed not by
petty pedant rules of grammar
but by the way it is used by the
man in the street. So I object to
last week's l e t t e r f r o m S h e i l a
Farrell of I F whose snobbery
a b o u t t h e E n g l i s h l a n g u a g e
typifies t h e m e m b e r s of that
i n s t i t u t i o n . A n i n s t i t u t i o n
snobbish and pretentious enough
to call itself Institut Francais and
not the T h e F r e n c h I n s t i t u t e
(does the Goethe Institute call
itself Goethe Institute?) whose
students at nineteen still sit up lor
teacher a n d l a p u p grammar
from the days of T h e Empire.
Therefore I ask that M s Farrell
leaves N i c k C o x ' articles alone in
future. Furthermore could she do
something about the stench of
garlic emanating from IF?

s u b j e c t o f the a b u s e o f the

T h e blatant'illiteracy exhibited
by "ledit bonhomme" is illustra-

tious institution whose students
spend the major proportion of
their time in the "consumation"
of the s u b s t a n c e c o m m o n l y

sleep (or read F E L I X ) during the

W e were very surprised to see
the c o m m e n t s m a d e b y t h e
m e m b e r s o f B e r n a r d S u n l e y
House i n last week's F E L I X .
D u r i n g our stay in that venerable
establishment (with its comfor-
t a b l e r o o m s a n d e x c e l l e n t
facilities) we found M r L u i g i
Toxic substances a most affable
character. H e was very under-
standing when we had cause to
complain, and he even returned
our soggy envelopes after the
mail was stolen and dropped in a
cistern. Clearly such vindictive
comments as those of the " h i t
s q u a d " a r e u n j u s t i f i e d , a n d
tantamount to libel.
W e hope the 'gentlemen' who
wrote the letter referred to enjoy
their stay in B S H as much as we
enjoyed ours (!).
M a y we also take this oppor-
tunity to say that we have found
F E L I X most s t i m u l a t i n g this

Chelsea
College
to close?
T H E S W I N N E R T O N - D Y E R
C o m m i t t e e o n the a c a d e m i c
organisation of L o n d o n U n i v e r -
sity have recently produced a
surprising interim report which
suggests that C h e l s e a C o l l e g e
c o u l d be closed d o w n . A l s o ,
B e d f o r d a n d W e s t f i e l d w o u l d
form a consortium a n d R o y a l
Holloway would lose its depart-
ment of physical sciences.
T h e committee are looking lor
ways to cut costs in U L as a result
of projected reduced income from
overseas students following the
government's decision to impose
full-cost fees. It is felt that closure
of a complete school is better
than risking academic standards
throughout the University. I C ,
K i n g s , L S E a n d U n i v e r s i t y
College seem safe from the axe as
they come high on the order of
merit, although cuts in individual
d e p a r t m e n t s m a y have to be
made.
T h e C o m m i t t e e r e c o g n i s e
Chelsea's reputation in science
a n d e d u c a t i o n b u t a r e n o t
confident about the rest of the
College. It is stressed that the
science section should be pre-
served. If the majority of the rest
of the College is closed, this could
m e a n a merger w i t h a n o t h e r
school, possibly I C .
Prior to the interim report, it
was widely thought that Q E C
w o u l d be r e c o m m e n d e d f o r
closure (it has a large overseas
student p o p u l a t i o n ) , b u t t h e
committee says the college is a
success. However, if further cuts
were to be made, it is suggested
that Q E C should be eventually
incorporated into I C .
Watch out
etc.
T H R E E S T U D E N T S h a v e
recently had their cheque books
stolen and everyone is urged not
to leave theirjackets in unattended
offices etc.
A n inspection of the forged
signatures has revealed that the
thief was the same in all three
cases. A technique often used by
thieves s p e c i a l i s i n g in c h e q u e
books is to remove a few blank
cheques near the end of the book.
These often,go unnoticed for days
enabling the thief to raid bank
• accounts with ease. So, to end on
a g o o d c l i c h e — W a t c h o u t ,
there's a thief about!
