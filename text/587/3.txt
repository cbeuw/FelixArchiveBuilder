Montezuma's Revenge
or Turkey Trots
By Dr Tony Haines
The Editor of FELIX rang me to request an article on innoculations, etc., that people
may require for going abroad. I have hastened to comply with his request. Who
knows, if I didn't he might send round one of his reporters to do the sort of hatchet
job he's already done on Mr Mooney and our representative of the Navy.
I suspect that he only rang to ask for this article so he could tap me for information
about his own trip to South America, and wanted an excuse to ring. Anyway, I
thought, as I noted down details, I could always ask Dr Addenbrooke to do the
"needful".
"How many words do you want?" I asked him firmly. Editors, Ifeel, like to be asked
these questions; it fills them with a sense of importance. "As many as you like," he
said flatteringly, pressing on to make further enquiries about South America.
Before taking time out to trot down the
corridor to ask Dr Addenbrooke if she would
write the article, or, at least, update her
original one on immunisations, I wondered for
a brief moment whether he was, in fact, being
sent to South America by John Passmore, or
even by the Rector, or was he just going on his
own accord, for a jaunt?
1 broached the project with Dr Addenbrooke;
she eyed me with a rather baleful look, and
said " Y o u must be joking," in that inimitable
way she has of dealing with what she considers
to be my more futile requests.
I am desperately staring at the few notes
that 1 wrote while contemplating the editor's
trip — e n f o r c e d or o t h e r w i s e — t o S o u t h
America. (Do you think they'll allow him to
interview Biggs?)
There are, I suppose, two approaches to
immunisations. I always play safe with the
Rector before he goes abroad, and by the time
1 have finished with him, he resembles a sort of
rectorial pin-cushion. I feel my reputation will
suffer if he comes back with any malaise, let
alone a dread disease I might have been able to
prevent.
Mr Smith, our secretary, on the other hand,
is a seasoned traveller who has, no doubt, had
his share of innoculations. He keeps me firmly
at bay, allowing no nurse to get her cold hands
on him to insert the dreaded needle. He just
takes his anti-malarial tablets.
Malaria
I have already written about malaria and
pointed out that this is becoming the scourge
of our time. Attempts at control have not been
successful. You must take your anti-malarial
tablets. Contact the College Health Service.
Immunisations
There are, today, few immunisations, apart
from yellow fever, that you must have done
going abroad. The details of what you need for
each country is shown in an appendix which
Leo Laboratories Ltd and the medical paper
' D o c t o r ' have very kindly allowed me to
reproduce. Y o u can also check with the airline
and the embassy of any exotic country you
may be visiting (Ed please note). The advice
may be conflicting!
VeHou; Fever: valid ten years.
Done at:
1) British A i r w a y s V i c t o r i a A i r T e r m i n a l
Immunisation Centre, Buckingham Palace Rd,
SW1. Tel: 834-2323.
2) Hospital for Tropical Diseases, St Pancras
W a y , N W 1 . P r o m p t attendance 11:30am,
Monday to Friday.
A charge will be made.
Cholera: valid six months only.
One injection only, and this should be given
seven to ten days before departure. Very few
countries require an international certificate
for cholera today, although the World Health
.Organisation recommend that you have this
Xor a great many countries—and you may be
asked for a certificate if an attack breaks out.
It is quite easy to buy a false certificate,
although often cheaper to have the real
injection, if abroad!
Monovalent Typhoid: valid three years, if
you have the first two jabs at least one month
apart, otherwise valid only one year.
The old T A B jab much loved in the army
against typhoid and paratyphoid A & B looks
like being discontinued.
The paratyphoid A & B part of the injection
was not very effective and was also the
component which caused people to have sore
a r m s , t e m p e r a t u r e s , a n d feel g e n e r a l l y
"grotty". The monavalent typhoid is more
effective, and is less likely to cause an upset,
although you are advised to keep off the booze
the night you've had it.
Poliomyelitits: length of protection uncertain.
This is given in the form of drops—your tender
skin can remain unpunctured. Most people
have had adequate immunisation as a child,
with a booster at twelve—if they have been
wise enough to go to state schools.
If you are going outside Europe, it would be
advisable to have a booster, especially if it is
over five years since your last one, but not if
you are pregnant.
Tetanus Toxoid: valid for approximately five
to ten years.
A g a i n , most people have been injected
against tetanus, and require a boost every
five/ten years. A primary course is three
injections, the first two being six/twelve weeks
apart and the third being six/twelve months
later. Y o u will be well advised to have this
done, and also to keep a record in your
passport when you are due for your next
booster. Remember, also, that England is
certainly one of the places where tetanus
spores abound, as well as in Northern Europe.
R a b i e s
If you are going to work collecting animals that
could be affected by rabies, or meet up with
any rabid animal, you should be immunised
against this. This is a fairly new injection and is
available at: B r i t i s h A i r w a y s V i c t o r i a A i r
Terminal Immunisation Centre, Buckingham
Palace Rd, S W 1 . Tel: 834-2323. By appoint-
ment only.
The injection is, I believe, quite expenisve,
and costs £5. A few of our intrepid staff may
find themselves working with rabid animals as
part of their jobs, in which case the College will
reimburse the cost of this.
Gamma Globulin: lasts about three months
only.
Not an immunisation, but a pooled porfion
or Delhi-Belly
from other people's serum which gives short
term p r o t e c t i o n against some infections,
e s p e c i a l l y i n f e c t i v e h e p a t i t i s . If y o u are
travelling rough—maybe taking the "hippy
trail" to meet a guru in North India (I wonder
why the editor isn't doing this—although I
suppose that after his exchanges with Dave
Afolabe, he may not feel this need to meet a
guru), then it would be advisable to have an
injection of gamma globulin as near to your
departure date as possible. This will give you
some, although not total, protection against
infective hepatitis, which is an extremely nasty
illness and may make you feel unwell for quite
a long time. It may also give you s o m e
protection for a limited period against viral
infections, although certainly not for long
against a common cold.
Y o u may think that by the time you have
had all this, you will be in no fit condition to do
your examinations, and you could be right!
H o w e v e r , I'm not too k e e n o n i s s u i n g
everybody with certificates to say their work
has been handicapped by pre-travel sickness.
So that when the editor asked me how soon
everyone should start, then the answer is,
p e r h a p s , " y e s t e r d a y " or " l a s t m o n t h " .
Anyway, get it done soon.
Mountain Sickness
Perhaps, as I have been given unlimited space,
1 should say a word about mountain sickness,
in case the editor is climbing on his South
A m e r i c a n t r i p . T h e r e have b e e n r e c e n t
suggestions in the medical press that a drug
called Diamox prevents mountain sickness.
There is no adequate research evidence to
back this up.
The basic rules of mountaineering at high
altitude is that one climbs slowly to 10,000ft.
Y o u can then climb up to 15,000ft the next
day, but should sleep at 11,000ft. The following
day you can go up to 17,000ft, but should sleep
at 12,000ft, and this is called the "climb high,
sleep low" policy.
If having reached 10,000ft you try to press
on to fast, and sleep at 12,000ft the first night
and 14,000ft the next night, a member of the
group may run into mountain sickness.
This may not be the most unfit member. A
doctor from Birmingham said that when their
group tried to press on fast, during the night at
14,000ft, one member of their group became
unconscious. His advice was that one should
always have a yak handy, as these can run you
down the mountain fairly quickly, and this is
the cure.
I hope our gallant editor will not have to be
run d o w n the m o u n t a i n on a yak, w h i c h
sounds rather undignified, and should heed my
advice to "climb high and sleep low".
At the end of this article is the map, but
rather than trying to sort it out for yourself the
easiest way is to come along and see one of the
nurses (Jean Chapman was working at British
Airways before coming here—so we are all
kept in order) to get some advice, about
exactly what you will need for your trip.
I do hope you are all having a lovely long
summer holiday, a long way away in Peru,
India or s o m e o t h e r e x o t i c p l a c e , a n d
especially that you will be away for August,
when doctors Addenbrooke and Gillon will
both be away, and I shall be left on my own, so
be warned!
Bon Voyage.
