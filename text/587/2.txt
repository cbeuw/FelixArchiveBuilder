r Letters to
V the Editor
Dear Sir
I wish to complain about your
editorial in last week's issue of
F E L I X (no 586).
The vast majority of the people
that I have met on I C U Council
are q u i e t , u n a s s u m i n g , polite
people who are soley interested in
serving the interest of their fellow
students.
T o refer to these people as
"ego-centric, pseudo-politico,
nancy-boy, pettyfogging twats"
is indeed an insult, and besides
which, it is grossly untrue.
Instead of casting aspersions on
many good people, may I suggest
that you either give credit where
credit is due, or shut up.
Yours faithfully
C J Batchelor

Y o u were one of the people on
Council I referred to as " w i t h only
a lew exceptions". Well done
C o l i n ! K e e p up the good work!
.SVr
I was appalled when I read your
e d i t o r i a l i n the last issue ol
F E L I X . M a n y other members of
Council to whom I have spoken
were also a p p a l l e d . W e were
a p p a l l e d that y o u eOtild so
misconstrue the facts on which,
at the end of the day, your ease
must rest. It is right and proper
that you should point out that a
few members of C o u n c i l do not
have the same deep regard for
the L'nion as the rest of us. I,
myseM a member of P W P this
\ear. have striven to get people
around the table to establish a
meaningful dialogue on many-
areas relevant to student life.
As for your charge of egocen-
tricity what pillle! I often talk to
ordinary students and sometimes
allow them to buy me a drink. In
addition to accuse members ol
Council of pomposity merits the
r i d i c u l e it so fully a n d justly
deserves.
Y o u raise the case of Social
C o l o u r s a w a r d s as a p r i m e
example of back-slapping among
hacks. This is an award, which I
n o t e y o u w e r e not d e e m e d
worthy of receiving. I can only
speak for myself in stating that I
am proud to wear the tie that I
know I fully deserve. Also M r
Editor Marshall (I hope that
engenders enough respect) who
put forward the Social Colour
n o m i n a t i o n s lor F E L I X stall,
surely 'not yourself, a man ol
towering moral principle.

Dear Steve
I was most interested to read
y o u r e d i t o r i a l in last week's
F E L I X . I found it most amusing,
as I believe did most students.
However, whilst I find it hard
to disagree w i t h the general
theme of your remarks, I would
like to take up a couple of points
where I thought you were slightly
wide of the mark.
Firstly, on perhaps a slightly
petty note, I am interested as to
where you obtain your informa-
tion about M r Passmore's time of
arrival in the U n i o n Oflirc. I
don't believe you've olten been
seen in your office before 2:00pm.
A n d how you can have the gall to
describe yourself as a 'serious
observer of the U n i o n ' is quite
beyond me.
O n a more serious note, I refer
to your comments on the L^nion
Council. As a member of this
prestigious body I found myself
reeling from the sheer verbosity
of your description ol its honour-
able members. (I don't have the
p r e s u m p t o u s n e s s to a s s u m e
myself one of your 'few excep-
t i o n s ' . ) A f t e r s o m e t h o u g h t ,
however, I realised that not only
have you misjudged the situation,
but you are wrong as well. (This
isn't surprising since you've only
been to C o u n c i l once this year.)
Far from being 'ego-centric'
a n d ' p s e u d o - p o l i t i c a l ' most
members display the intelligence.
s k i l l a n d c o n c e r n f o r t h e i r
responsibilities of a S o u t h s i d e
Chef. M a n y lit the description of
b e i n g b o r i n g , a p a t h e t i c a n d
largely incompetant individuals
who downgade C o u n c i l to the
'rubber-stamping' body that it
often becomes. They have been
b l i n d to the i n e p t i t u d e a n d
esoteric indifference of the Exec,
a n d have a i d e d a n d abetted
' c o o p e r a t i o n ' v e r g i n g on ac-
quiescence with almost every-
t h i n g C o l l e g e t h r o w s at the
U n i o n .
T h e r e are, however, a few
e x c e p t i o n s , w h o c o u l d c o n -
ceivably be described as 'ego-
c e n t i c ' , 'pseu*do-political' a n d
'pettyfogging' by a cynic such as
y o u r s e l f . T h e y are the o n l y
effective v o i c e of o p p o s i t i o n
(apart from your good self) to the
Exec, the main check on their
otherwise unbridled activities. I
am pleased to number myself
amongst them.

sabbaticals were equally deserv-
ing of a U G A (think about it).
Dear S Marshall
II you are going to slag off
J o h n " U G A " Passmore why
restrict yourself to idiotic and
inaccurate backbiting. There are
many concrete issues which can
be justifiably cited to show his
lethargy and ineffectiveness as
I C U President—lack of realistic
action on union policy on C N D
and on South African participa-
t i o n i n n u c l e a r t e c h n o l o g y
courses; lack of sensitivity to
everyday issues affecting many
s t u d e n t s i n C o l l e g e s u c h as
refectories and overseas students
f i n a n c i n g p r o b l e m s — to name
but a few. If you want to start a
reasonable debate on the role ol
our glorious leader, then let's
have some facts to argue about.

Ed's Note
I don't know who you are, but
you immediately strike me as a
person who's not too hot upstairs,
if you take my meaning. Where
were you w h e n I c r i t i c i s e d J
Passmore for exactly the things
you mention? Probably screwing
a lew of those delectable birds
from W I S T , i f l ' m not very much
mistaken.
Dear "Sir"
Y o u r paper undulated into its
lower depths last week in your
particularly unpleasant remarks
a b o u t R a e S n e e a n d R u t h
Hildebrand. W e are not going to
q u e s t i o n as to w h e t h e r y o u r
attacks were j u s t i f i e d or not,
however we strongly object to the
sexist nature ol your comments.
The size of breast, the supposedly
" u n l e m i n i n e " appearance ("fat
a n d u g l y " ) do not affect a
person's capacity to fulfil a role
i n the U n i o n or express a n
opinion.
If y o u w o u l d l i k e to p u t
forward positive suggestions as to
work J Passmore should do, then
state them and do not resort to
idiotic and inaccurate back-
b i t i n g (haven't I heard this
somewhere before?-Ed.). W e object
to the use of the image of a
helpless w o m a n t h i n g b e i n g
"petted" in the U n i o n Office as
part of your attack. W e do not
happen to be little furry animals.
Whilst these " f u n n y " remarks
were probably slipped in without
a n y t h o u g h t , we ask y o u to
reconsider them as they present
an attack not only on the persons
directly concerned but on all
women in College. W o m e n will
stand no chance of playing an
equal role in a society which is
blinded by the image of women
as sexual objects.
N B We are writing in defence
of women in general and not
prompted by requests from the
individuals concerned here.

Ed s Note
Does " W I S T " stand for " W i l d e -
beests in Science & Technology"?
Most of the people in " W I S T "
seem to be men. Is Simon C o x in
" W I S T " ? ' S p e d he's just after a
quick letch, eh, girls?
Dear Steve
As the amount of space available
in F E L I X for letters has appar-
ently expanded, I thought that I
might actually bother to write in
this week. I shall however try to
keep the prose simple, as I know-
that literacy is not one of your
s t r o n g points. I have several
unconnected points to make.
One: W h y do you sometimes
print letters with pseudonyms,
and at other times refuse to print
letters because they are signed
with pseudonyms?
T w o : W h y do you answer
criticism with insults to the critic
rather than reasoned argument?
T h r e e : W h y do y o u t h i n k
social colours are so important?
Four: W h y do you like L i z
Lindsay so much? (I ask this out
ol simple curiousity, my only
exposure to her having been her
shrill cries "come back this is
important" at U G M s and her
b l a t a n t l i e s a b o u t s t u d e n t
h o u s i n g at the Physics O p e n
Day.)
Five: Swearing in print is not
ol itsell amusing but has to be
made so in context.
Six: W h e n you ended your
most recent editorial "Assume
normal student boring, ineffectual
lifestyles" were you addressing
yourself, your readership or both,
and w o u l d n ' t " r e s u m e " have
fitted better?
