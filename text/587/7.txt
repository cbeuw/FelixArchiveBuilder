The Penultimate Issue
Y e s folks, this is it. There will be no issue
next week, the last F E L I X of this year will
appear on J u n e 19 and it promises to be a
monster (fingers crossed!). K e e p sending the
letters, etc, in. It's nice to see such an active
letters' page, despite third term exams.
Perhaps you're not quite so boring as I
thought you were.
Bound Editions
If you want your copies of F E L I X bound in
black with gold lettering with your name on
it, t h e n c o m e a n d see me as s o o n as
possible—say- within a week of the last
issue. It'll set you back about £11 if we get
the quantity discount (likely!). If y o u get it in
late you have to pay about £16 for an
individual job. W e should be able to fill most
gaps in your collection, or even make up a
complete set, from our files!
A Special Thanks
T o D r H a i n e s for his great a r t i c l e o n
vaccinations. After my last issue I intend to
t a k e a d v a n t a g e o f B r a z i l ' s c u r i o u s
extradition laws, so I found it very useful.
Next Year's Subscriptions
Want F E L I X posted to you next year? A
year's subscription to F E L I X will cost £7.00
for those living in the U K (special rates will
be arranged for those living abroad). F o r
more information contact the F E L I X Office,
or check the next issue.
FELIX Motor Rally
O n Sunday, June 21. Entries are piling in.
It's first come, first served, so don't risk not
being included and contact us as soon or as
late as you dare leave it.
Stop Press
Students who found last month particularly
cold will not be surprised to learn officially
that M a y this year has been the unsunniest in
South Kensington since 1932.
A s k e d how many days had been sunny in
May, C a p t Lindley ( R N R ) said "I don't know,
1 don't stand and count 'em, and it's not up to
me to count them either."
J o h n Passmore ( I C U President) said he
would resign immediately, but stressed he
would hang on to his U G A .
To while away odd moments aboard the Star
Ship Enterprise, there's nothing M r Spock
enjoys more than a game of dominoes. But
Captain Kirk disapproves of such frivolity, and
with a single blast of high-intensity cosmic
energy from his ray gun he has welded M r
Spock's dominoes into a solid block. C a n you
help Spock by showing him where to cut the
block to get his set of dominoes back?

(In a full set of dominoes, of course, there is
just one of every possible pair of numbers from
0 to 6, including doubles.)
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o
FELIX Office. There is a prize of £5 donated
by Mend a-Bike for the correct solution
randomly selectedat LOOpmnextWednesday.
Last Week's Solution
It is possible that Quirk is telling the truth.
E.g. 1/10 is less than 2/18.
and 2/8 is less than 1/3.
but 3/18 is more than 3/21.
The prizewinner is Derrick Everett, Physics
P G .
Many people seemed to think the answer
obvious, although they had a little difficult
finding a numerical example. For my part, I
neither understand nor believe the result; the
figures are there, unquestionably correct, but
the more I think about them, the more baffled I
get.
There won't be a F E L I X next week; Steve's
saving his pent-up malice for one last outburst
before he seeks asylum in South America, and
so the next Scaramouche will be the puzzle
page in the last issue of term, so write in and
say what you want me to include, what sort of
puzzles you enjoy, what sort you don't enjoy,
whether you like them easy or difficult, and
whether you want answers in the edition, or if
y o u ' d prefer them kept till O c t o b e r . T h e
disadvantage of that, of course, is that third
years and others who are leaving won't get the
answers at all (unless they have a subscription
for FELIX'.-see Editorial). But on the other
hand, I always feel that if the answers are inclu-
ded in the same issue, people who would other-
wise try the puzzles are tempted to turn straight
to the solution, and so I tend to be less inclined
to put lots of thought into setting them.
Also, if anyone wants to set a puzzle for the
summer page, they are more than welcome to
do so; I'll need it as soon as possible, and
definitely no later than 5:30pm, Monday, June
15.
In any event, if you've attempted any of the
puzzles over the year, write to me now; my
orange box in the F E L I X Office is emptied
regularly whether there's a puzzle current or
not, so send your views even if you can't do
this week's puzzle.
But do try it. I've had a lot of fun setting it,
and I think you'll enjoy solving it!
