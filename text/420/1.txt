Bath
PROFESSOR P.T.Matthews,
the physics HOD (Head of
Department), is to become the
new Vice-Chancellor of Bath
University, it was announced
last week.
Prof Matthews came to IC
in 1957, as a reader in the
Mathematics department, after
spending some time in America
doing research. He followed
this with five years at
Birmingham University as a
lecturer.
In 1960 he moved to the
Blackett Laboratory together
with Dr Salaam when it was
first opened. He was made a
professor in 1962.
It i s almost certain that
Prof Bradley, F R S , will be
appointed as Prof Matthews
successor when the Board of
Governors meet to choose the
new head. Prof Bradley is
being recommended to the
Governors by the Rector after
consultation w i t h the
Department.

T H E F U T U R E of the U n i o n ' s
first alternative Prospectus
(AP) hangs in the balance
following last Thursday's
Admission P o l i c y Committee
meeting: Members of the
Committee were angry that a
final draft of the A P had
not been presented to them
prior to being sent off for
printing'.
T h e Chairman of the
Committee, Prof Wood, d i d
however receive a copy of
A P i n i t s final form before
printing commenced. H e
returned the copy to the
Union with various comments.
The U n i o n , after careful
consideration decided to a l l o w
printing to b e g i n .
Before the meeting, R i c k
Parker, I C U A A O , i n charge
of producing the A P , received
a communication informing
him that a l l " r e s p o n s i b i l i t y ,
legal and o t h e r w i s e " , for the
Prospectus was h i s .
Rick Parker
The letter from Mr G o o c h ,
Senior A s s i s t a n t Registrar,
noted that although the
document a s a whole w a s
commendable, it was "marred
by the odd remark which i s
unfair, unnecessary, a n d may
be damaging to the C o l l e g e " .
It was around this statement
and one or two unaccuracies
contained i n departmental
submissions that the debates
centred.

Ms G L E N D A J A C K S O N , star
of two Morecambe and Wise
Christmas Shows, gave an
interview to Mark C a l d w e l l ,
S T O I C ' S incumbent Chairman,'
last week. M s J a c k s o n , who
has received 40 film awards to
date, talked with Mark for
almort half an hour i n front of
a small audience of S T O I C and
F E L I X staff.
The interview w a s , Mark
s a i d to F E L I X afterwards,
"One of the most rewarding I
have ever done," a n d indeed,
flowed smoothly throughout.
E x c e p t , that i s , when a g e l
nearly fell of a spotlight.
Ms J a c k s o n ' s humour was ever
present, and although it w i l l
not be shown o n S T O I C , she
s a i d that working with E r i c
and E r n i e w a s , to her, "a
paid holiday," Just after
receiving her second O s c a r ,
for her part i n " A T o u c h of
C l a s s " , amidst the many'
telegrams of congratulation
she turned up s a y i n g quite
simply "Stick with us, we'll
get you a third — E n ' c and
Ernie."
That showed c l a s s — more
than just a touch.
At the e n d of the debate,
which lasted nearly 1% hours,
the Committee approved a
draft document which h a s now
been sent to the R e c t o r . T h e
document states the v i e w that
there are unacceptable errors
in the Prospectus which the
Committee might have a s k e d
the U n i o n to change h a d this
been p o s s i b l e .
Some members of the
Committee expressed the v i e w
that the Alternative P r o s p e c t u s
should not be sent out with the
C o l l e g e P r o s p e c t u s . It was felt
that if funds a n d time were
available then corrections
should be made and the
Prospectus sent out separately.
The postage c o s t alone, i n
this c a s e , would be w e l l over
£60C..The budget a l l o w e d for
the Prospectus i s £1100. T h i s
compares with over three times
this amount w h i c h Manchester
U n i v e r s i t y spend o n their A P .
The P r o s p e c t u s i s at
present almost printed but has
not been bound. P r i n t i n g h a s
now been halted to await the
R e c t o r ' s d e c i s i o n once he has
considered the situation. He
is expected to make h i s v i e w
known early next week.
"It i s unfortunate that the
system s e t up to oversee this
project d i d not function as
efficiently as one would have
l i k e d . There a r e , inevitably,
problems with a n y new venture
and one must be careful not to
o v e r - r e a c t " , Mr Parker s a i d
yesterday.
"If the yardstick applied
to the A P i s a p p l i e d to the
C o l l e g e P r o s p e c t u s , then it
too c a n be found to contain
items which are either factually
incorrect or m i s l e a d i n g " , he
added.
