Refectory and Residence
charges up
FOLLOWING A meeting on
Wednesday with the Chairmen
of both the Refectory and
Student Residence Committees
and the President of IC Union,
the Rector has decided to
recommend to the Finance and
Executive Committees of the
Governing Body that Hall and
House Rents be increased by
33% for the coming session
and that Refectory Prices be
increased by 10%. The College
has an accumulated deficit on
its Refectory and Residence
accounts of about £200,000,
and the Rector will ask the
Govenors to write off, this
deficit.
It i s however, not p o s s i b l e
to write off d e f i c i t s indefinitely
and the Rector is concerned
with showing the Governors
that a concerted effort is being
made to make the accounts
balance in the coming year.
The increase of 33% on
present H a l l and House rents
w i l l , if approved . b y the
Govenors, be implemented at
the start of the coming s e s s i o n
rather than on August 1st. T h i s
w i l l a l l o w those postgraduates
remaining in H a l l and House
to occupy their rooms at the
present level of rents through-
out the summer v a c a t i o n .
Recommended rents
for next s e s s i o n
Southside, L i n s t e a d , Weeks and
N r e w B e i t £9.60 per week
Single rooms in Garden H a l l ,
Student House and O l d B e i t
£8.30 per week.
Double rooms in Student Houses
and Garden H a l l £6.70 per week
Triple rooms in Student Houses
£6.15 per week.
The Rector is disappointed
that no concrete progress had
been made to cut down the
l e v e l of cleaning i n the H a l l s .
The Govenors had requested
that this problem be t a c k l e d
" u r g e n t l y " when they reviewed
the rents at Christmas. A cut
in cleaning c o s t s w o u l d be
directly reflected in a smaller
increase in Student rents. How-
ever, the C l e a n e r s ' U n i o n ,
N U P E , has rejected proposals
to cut the number o f cleaners
or to reduce the hours of
the present cleaners.
It is hoped that the
relatively small increase in
Refectory P r i c e s w i l l not
result in a reduction i n
customers in the coming year.
The Catering Manager w i l l have
the a b i l i t y to increase the
price of some items if their
cost price increases exception-
a l l y . A n y alterations w i l l have
to be authorised by the
Domestic Secretary and the
Chairman of the Refectory
Committee.
A l l the charges outlined
above w i l l be for the first
term of next s e s s i o n the
Rector feels it inseritable
with the present changing
rate of inflation that they w i l l
have to be reviewed termly.
Apology
F E L I X would like to apologise

Literary Hoax", published in
last week's issue of F E L I X .
This book does not in fact
exist and we also apologise
for misleading readers into
believing otherwise. The
article was purely fictitious
and we would ask readers
not to pursue a fruitless

Playboy John does it again
INTERNATIONAL P L A Y B O Y
an IC student John McCloskey
was this week made an honorary
life member of the Penthouse
Club in Mayfair.
At a special party thrown
'or John by the club
management, the young lad
was given the freedom of the
club Tor a whole evening. It
is believed Johnfwho incidently
is only the fifth person to
receive the honour) was made
a life member for his outstand-
ing contribution to the
prosperity of the Penthouse
Club.
During the evening John,
together with his escort for
the night, top model Felicity
Derbyshire, ran up a bill
totalling £115 paid on this
occasion, of course by the
management. When asked how
he could afford to frequent
such an expensive club on
most nights of the week (a
pint of lager costs 80p) while
Mving on a student grant,
McCloskey replied in no
uncertain terms that we should
mind our own business.
However, it is believed
John's interest in horse racing
accounts for much of his
finances, together with a
healthy chicken breeding
business at his home in
Kilburn. Good luck John!
