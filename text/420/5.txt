Or-Something nasty in the kitchen
I P R E F E R N O T lo eat in Southside. In
fact, whenever I have a choice I dine in
the Sherfield refectory or in the U n i o n .
But now that the Hot Pot has instigated
severe chip rationing (sliced carrots
being a poor substitute) I frequently have
to pay a visit to Southside to obtain my
week-end nourishment. But as I s a i d , I
would really prefer not to go there at a l l .
You see, I like to eat with clean cutlery.
I just don't want to have to eat dead
cabbage, dried gravy, encfusted
sheperd's-pie/hamburger/mi need-beef-rol I
served with a splash of s a l i v a au gratin.
Or at very least I want the option of not
eating it. That's why I usually go to the
Union or Sherfield refectories - it's safer.
Now this is no unfortunate slip-up. I've
been running regular risks of poisoning
myself over the last three years in
Southside. Many times have I brought this
poor state of hygiene to the attention
of the counter staff, but to no a v a i l .
That's fair enough - I expect that from
Southside. But what is more ominous is the
response to my complaints — "Sorry

the life of the C o l l e g e , and long may it
continue. It has given a welcome airing
to neglected music — for example, the
two Hoist suites played in recent concerts.
One hopes therefore that the members w i l l
foster the goodwill they undoubtedly have
by c l o s e r attention to their performing
standards - they've done better before,
and can do so again. It would be a sad
commentary on an original and entertain-
ing experiment if it were to be thought
of as no more than a poor joke.

nothing we can do - it's the M a c h i n e " ,
" T h a t ' s how they come out of the
Machine - but it does boil t h e m " . What
Machine? What is this Machine? Why
can't anything be done about the Machine?
I protest that this is not good enough and
am advised to fumble around in the
cutlery until I find a recognisable knife.
But I don't want to do that either.
Certainly I have no wish to consume
the decaying vegetation attached so
firmly to the knife, but neither do I want
to eat other people's grime, grease,
sweat and other unmentionable substances
that invariably find their way on to
human hands. I just don't like eating
dirt. Doesn't anybody realise this?
No, of course they don't, for they are
a l l servants of the Machine. Mr Mooney is
a mere minion, a puppet refectory
manager firmly under the control of the
Machine. The Southside staff have been
reduced to minor automatons, the sole
purpose of their miserable existance to
protect and defend the Machine at a l l
c o s t s . E v e n Pedro is worked by strings.
The Machine rules O K .
There can be no doubt that the
Machine is a threat to life as we know
it. But what is its purpose? Why is it
here? Where did it come from? I believe
that even now it is directing an intensive
propaganda campaign towards the similar,
but still d o c i l e , machines in the Union
and Sherfield refectories. And if they
succumb we are doomed - it is abundantly
clear that the aim of the Machine is to
eradicate all human life at IC by s l o w ,
deliberate poisoning.
A s if that's not bad enough, don't
forget that the Machine is not a clever
thing like a computer or a parking meter.
I mean, it doesn't have anything remotely
resembling a brain. No, for a l l its power
the Machine is a mere electromechanical
moron, doggedly following its mindless
instincts of destruction. We are up
against the most powerful idiot the
C o l l e g e has ever known. That is the
final horror. You can't even outwit it,
for it has no wits.
What are we to do? How long before
the last surviving IC student chokes on
a putrid pea and suffocates? How then
w i l l the Machine satiate its thirst for
death? Will it turn on Mooney? You bet.
When he's finished his job h e ' l l go the
same way as the rest of us. Probably
stabbed in the throat with a septic
fork.
And then what? Have no i l l u s i o n s ;
having wiped out Imperial C o l l e g e it w i l l
turn to greater things. The day Mooney's
giblets are bundled into the mincer w i l l
be Judgement Day for this planet. In
kitchens all over the world, slumbering
dish-washers w i l l be awakening and
rising to their ultimate task; their tinny
cries of " u l - c e - r a t e ! " s i g n a l l i n g the
e c l i p s e of man and his world. There w i l l
be no escape. On that day, when the
kitchen doors open, the world w i l l see
the face of the Machine. But then it w i l l
be too late.
We must not panic. There is s t i l l
time. The Machine has yet to entwine
its tentacles around Sherfield and the
Union. A n n a still gives you extra chips
if you want them. We must put our faith
in God and the Refectory Complaints
Committee — and a plentiful supply of
paper napkins...
