Kicking them while they're down
A B O U T T H R E E years ago a report in the
Guardian revealed that British companies
in South A f r i c a were paying workers at
rates below a poverty datum line. Some
outcry followed, and one year later the
Government responded by asking the
companies involved to reform themselves
or face legislation. L a s t week the
Sunday T i m e s reported on what progress
had been made and concluded that 'Some
British companies are s t i l l paying black
workers below s u b s i s t e n c e l e v e l s .
Most companies are paying below the
minimum wage rate laid down by the
British Government'. So what now? Will
HMG legislate? I would be pleasantly
surprised if they d i d , but the omens are
not good. L e s s than two weeks ago in
Nairobi, the new Secretary of State for
Trade, Edmund D e l l , made a speech which
was less than propitious. It revealed
that in international economic policy
Britain lies to the right of most of the
E E C , and had even less to offer in
the way of new ideas than the U S A .
He was speaking at U N C T A D , the U N
conference confronting basic problems of
large-scale poverty in the Third World,
including inter a l i a the role of multi- or
trans-national corporations. H i s emphasis
was on charity by the rich countries as
the key. Not justice, or even ordinary
decency in trade and investment matters
(which is what the conference is about),
but the dropping of crumbs from tables
made replete in the first place by taking
advantage of the poverty and power-
lessness such as that endured by black
people in South A f r i c a . H i s words earned
Britain a new nickname: " T h e U N C T A D
S N A I L O F E u r o p e " .
I am particularly incensed about such
news, partly because I was duped in
1974 by the bland assurances of the
companies I wrote to and the apparent
determination of the Government, but also
because I resent the hypocrisy of a
Labour Government which would make
the poor carry the burdens of the r i c h .
For even an unemployed person here is
better off than some 800 million people
in the worst of poverty abroad, and it is
gravely misleading to try to tackle their
problems in isolation, or by aid programmes
alone. It should not be forgotten that
Britain depends on international trade
for half its food and three-quarters of its
raw materials.
So what now? The power seems to lie
with the companies, but at least I can
decide to remember the worst of them and
avoid buying their goods or working for
them. When pushed on questions of
morality (a concept not found on balance
sheets), they seem bedrocked on the
idea that if their shareholders make
money then somehow the whole world is
better off. Not me. My stomach can't take
it any more. J o h n Shade
Play it together, Don!
Von Suppe: Light Cavalry overture;
Elgar: Pomp & Circumstance March No. 1;
Tchaikovsky: 1812 Overture.
No doubt as an attempt to end the
drought, the IC Wind Ensemble, whose
a c t i v i t i e s in the open air traditionally
seem to attract rain, attempted to propitiate
the elements, but succeeded better in
attracting the unwelcome attentions of
jet planes rather than those of Jupiter
P l u v i o u s ; the weather remained obsurately
dry.
However, in between s u c c e s s i v e
passes by the agents of Pan Demon ium
A i r w a y s , the Wind Band gave us its most
theatrical entertainment to date, not
entirely to its own credit, commencing
with Von Suppe's Light Cavalry overture.
T h i s p i e c e , apparently written in memory
of a third c l a s s trip on Austro-Hungarian
R a i l w a y s , has a lumpish nature c a l l i n g
for more bounce than the jog it got if it
is to come off, so that its resemblance
was more to M i l l i g a n ' s Underwater
Artillery than to Light C a v a l r y . The
audience, attracted by the w i l e s of
advance publicity, applauded politely
and waited for the next number, the old
warhorse, E l g a r ' s Pomp & Circumstance
March No. 1, so beloved of patriotic
listeners at Waterloo Station. After a
flawed start when one of the participants
kicked off before the whistle, it proceeded
to a not much better middle and end, due
mainly to ragged ensemble and lack of
rehearsal, compounded by a lack of
audience enthusiasm when they refused
to sing the Land of Hope and Glory bit.
Perhaps most of them didn't know the
words, or maybe it was a matter of
principle.
These though were the B-feature
that precedes the real thing, the moment
we've all been waiting for, which kept
to the theme of militarism in the shape
of T c h a i k o v s k y ' s 1812 overture. For
anyone who is unfamiliar with it (and
there must be a few), this is a rambling
concoction lacking in design which ropes
in a diverse ragbag of material ranging
from- R u s s i a n hymns and folk songs to
la M a r s e i l l a i s e with almost Mahler-like
abandon. The high spots of the performance
lay in the special effects department â€”
e x p l o s i v e in the case of Mr Shorter's
mortars doubling for cannon-fire, e l e c t r i c -
ally detonated in dustbins half-way up
the Queen's Tower, giving the passing
aircraft something to think about. The
police were warned in advance. The
University of London Bellringers managed
to extract some musical notes from the
appalling peal, an achievement in marked
contrast to the customary leaden c l a n k s
emenating from up there.The performance
at ground level was something less of an
achievement: missed notes are one thing,
but to be quite as far out of tune as
some of the conspirators were, and poor
ensemble, e s p e c i a l l y at the less-than-
breakneck tempi adopted by Conductor
Munro, are quite another. Most to blame
were the woodwinds, but the other
blowers were not free of taint. The
band seemed to rely on the spectacular
to divert attention from the particular:
fireworks off, though entertaining,
didn't make up for lack of attention to
d e t a i l s .
The Wind E n s e m b l e ' s a c t i v i t i e s are
interesting and enjoyable contribution to
