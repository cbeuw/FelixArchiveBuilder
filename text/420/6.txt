Theatre A cyclic Irish history
The Non-Stop Connolly C y c l e T h e Almost Free Theatre
The television pundits tell us that the
majority of people in this country are
astonishingly politically ignorant -
apparently only one person in five
interviewed on Brighton prom, last
summer could name the Foreign Secretary.
There is probably one thing above a l l
others that Englishmen fail to understand
and that is the Irish problem, something
that has been with us for over three
hundred years.
It is in order to remedy this glaring
failure of education that Margaretta
D'Arcy and John Arden have written a
series of fourteen p l a y s , each one hour
long, entitled The Non-Stop Connolly
Cycle. The complete Cycle w i l l be
shown twice; the first began last Monday
and the second starts on June 3rd, at
1.15 at the almost Free Theatre in
Rupert Street, between Shaftesbury
Avenue and L e i c e s t e r Square. A s is
usual with Almost Free shows members
of the audience pay as much as they feel
they can afford.
The C y c l e t e l l s the history of
Ireland from 1868 to 1916 through the
life story of one man, James C o n n o l l y ,
executed for his part in the E a s t e r
R i s i n g of 1916. In the first part, which
is the only one I have seen, Connolly
receives advice from his uncle, on the
run for his part in an abortive rebellion,
and searches for work in a poverty-
stricken Edinburgh, where no-one really
wants to employ an Irish C a t h o l i c boy.
A s a last resort he joins the Queen's
army and, ironically, is sent to Ireland
to put down disturbances caused by
peasants being evicted by tyrant absentee
landlords, safe from any agitation in
their Westminster strongholds. In Dublin
he meets a man promoting the works of
'the two Germans' Marx and E n g e l s , and
deserts to marry a young Protestant.
From a study of the s y n o p s i s given I
can tell you that the treatment of
C o n n o l l y ' s life is very d e t a i l e d ; so much
so that a comprehensive understanding
of the Irish Question can probably only
be gleaned by attendance at each of the
fourteen p l a y s . The political content of
the C y c l e is undeniable; the s y n o p s i s
of the final part states " C o n n o l l y goes
down in history as the first working-class
leader to enter the world struggle on a
S o c i a l i s t b a s i s " .
The plays contain both ballad songs
and verse and are performed on four s i d e s
of the audience; the disembodied v o i c e s
of the remote politicians in London coming
from behind us. The performances lose
nothing by being read and show a great
deal of commitment by the actors to
their material. If you take a two-hour
lunchbreak to see one of these plays you
w i l l certainly not be wasting your time.
I was sorry that I was not able to give
more space a fortnight ago to the Almost
F r e e ' s previous production — Tom
Stoppard's two new p l a y s , Dirty Linen
and New-Found-Land. These are two
plays in Stoppard's usual hilarious v e i n ,
with a first c l a s s cast. B e c a u s e of their
s u c c e s s they have been transferred to
the Arts Theatre from June 16th. Perform-
ances w i l l begin at 8.30pm, Mondays to
Thursdays, and at 7.00 to 9.00pm on
F r i d a y s and Saturdays. Book your seats
now for a riotous evening.
Next week I hope to be writing about
the Royal Shakespeare Company's
production of Eugene O'Neill's The
Iceman Cometh. Meanwhile news has
come from the Aldwych that until July 3rd
the s p e c i a l student standby ticket
arrangement w i l l operate from 10.00am.
Turn up with your Union card and you can
buy any seat available for £1 for that
evening's performance, of either The
Zykovs or The Iceman Cometh.

Graver Washington J N R - F e e l s So Good ( K U D U )
Y E T A N O T H E R jazzer moves into the
realms of cerebral funk and doing so with
characteristic s t y l e . T h i s is not a
street band. It's a set of super-slick
s e s s i o n men who'd be as much at home
playing this infectious bump-hump
stuff as avantgarde improvisations,
though presumably a few more ackers
can be found in supplying the punters
with product as palatable as this. Nota
Bene that " F e e l s s o G o o d " reached
well into the American charts earlier this
year (wid uh bullit!)
The first point that breaches the
subconcious is that Washington uses
some very ace drummers indeed, to wit
one Steve Gadd, he who hardly appears
to connect with you hi-hat, thereby
giving the sound an e s p e c i a l l y c r i s p
and urgent feel to it. T h i s sharpness is
highlighted on " T h e Sea L i o n " , a
substantial chunk of black power with
plenty of that body-building fonkeh-stoff,
toned down by the relaxed free-flowing
qualities of "Moonstreams that follows.
T h i s is achieved by Grover's gentle
flute s o l o and the simple bass patterns
of L o u i s Johnson (the great Alphonso
perchance?).
It's around now that the effect of
Herbie H a n c o c k ' s pioneering in the
jazz-funk f i e l d , from " H e a d h u n t e r s "
days onwards, is being felt, with an
outburst of accomplished j a z z musicians
releasing albums like tins which are
orientated towards the younger d i s c o
audiences. " K n u c k l e h e a d " (Track one,
side Two, and no relation to the Bar-kays
version) is a good example of this,
opening with a " c h a m e l e o n " like
bass/drums combination for the first
eight bars or s o and gradually taking
form with the addition of organ and
Washington's sax runs. The rest of the
track takes off from that foundation,
soaring guitar s o l o s , the o c c a s i o n a l
orchestral intrusion et a l , welded s o l i d
by the bass of Gary K i n g . The standard
of playing is as you'd expect from the
likes of Randy Brecker, providing his
usual faultless trumpet and Flugelhorn
blowing, and John James, subdued but
ever-subtle on organ.
The title track provides another
mammoth slab of rhythm-work, Washington
meandering and bellowing his way
Now, this is a whole different bag
of peanuts. T h i s is a street band.
P l a y i n g various forms of what is no
doubt Southend type street music. What
in all the heavens are a load of aviators
from the pavil;
on doing playing 'orrible
bluegrass, and country and western
schmaltz. Things do start to liven up a
bit towards the end of Side 1 though,
with the present single " C r u i s i n ' for
l o v e " and " B a c k to the b o o k " (mid-paced
rockers?)
Whereas Grover Washington and de
boys try out the " n e w " sounds emanating
from the black American music scene,
the kursaals are very definitely a
derivative band, sticking carefully to
what's been done before, whether it
be the aforementioned Johnny Casherama
or Harry Belafonte calypso-ing to the
through the beat till E r i c G a l e ' s guitar
takes charge of matters and proceeds to
" d o it's t h i n g " rather tastefully, all over
the little black plastic stuff. When
a l l ' s said and done, you get three
tracks of brash, unashamedly high-
concentration funk, one mid-tempo roust
by the name of " H y d r a " , and one
melodic, wispy, wallow, courtesy of
" M o o n s t r e a m s " , the whole effort mobly
compelled along by some superlative
drumming. T h i s is not a street band. It
is c l a s s .
What do you mean you haven't bought
" T h e Last Record A l b u m " yet? Gor
blimey!
strain of " P a l a i s de D a n s e " . They
exude some slightly anaemic rockin' on
" P a i n and M i s e r y " , where Lead guitarist
Graeme Douglas shows that he can whip
it out now and again if his butties
depend on it, but Paul Shuttleworth's
v o c a l s don't amount to much, except on
his nifty version of " y o ' reggae pick-a
-dub rasta-Jah r a s s - m a n " on " H y p o -
c h o n d r i a c " , the sole West Injun track
dey do. Interesting lyrics to v i s - a - v i s
" E l v i s , com an' git you beens, an' stop
shootin' op me calamine l o s h u n n " .
Ho-hum, back to a - B a b y l o n .
T h i s little ray of sunshine is followed,
needless to s a y , by more C and W
d r i v e l , by which time redemption has
been lost anyway. Except for " H y p o -
c h o n d r i a c " , a pretty ordinary L P really.
