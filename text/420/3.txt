The Haldane Library
T H E R E C O M E S a time in
every student's life when he
feels the need to escape — to
get away from it a l l — to
leave the partial differential
equations, the messons, the
torgues and the grain boundaries
of life and take up mountaineer-
ing, p o l i t i c s , acting or rugby
football. And when he's broken
his leg or become discredited
then he can turn to the Haldane
Library.
From here he can borrow
books on every non-academic
subject landsome that others
think academic from autobio-
graphies and art to travel and
yachting. There are hundreds
of gramophone records and
tape c a s s e t t e s of Gregorian
Chant, Beethoven, Mahler,
the Moody B l u e s and others.
N o v e l s by the whole range
of n o v e l i s t s from Austen to
Waugh are just waiting to be
dusted down and read.
If he can't find what he's
looking for it can either be
reserved or ordered - the staff
are very helpful. Two members
of the Union act as buyers of
novels and pop records — which
the Union pays for, whilst the
C o l l e g e finances the remainder.
The library also subscribes
to several daily newspapers
and a whole host of magazines
and periodicals to satisfy any
hi-fi buff or literary fanatic.
In short there's a whole
A l a d d i n ' s Cave of goodies on
Level 2 of the Sherfield
B u i l d i n g by the Great H a l l :
just keep on repeating the
magic words — Haldane Library.

LETTERS
It's all at the bar
Sir, — a reply is needed to such
a well worded article as that
by Stephen Humby entitled
" S m u g , U n c r i t i c a l I C " .
The motivation for writing
such a searing article about
the regimentation and m i n d l e s s -
ness of the academic systems
at IC lies deeper than is readily
apparent from a first reading.
Mr Humby's real discontent,
I think, lies with the lack of
any stimulating s o c i a l life at
IC. H i s article gives the
impression of someone who is
not satisfied with his work and
depressed at not making any
progress. A process which
makes one less w i l l i n g to
work.
The impression is a l s o
given of one who has no
social outlets from the boredom
of the IC system. Something
most here have or perhaps are
still putting up w i t h .
There is one small way to
get on top of your work (not
sitting on it). That i s to
s u c c e s s f u l l y s o l v e the problems
a little at a time. S u c c e s s g i v e s
one confidence and incentive
to get on with more work. So
do not tackle anything you
cannot handle.
A s for the s o c i a l s i d e ; a
great many people come to
university as a sort of " M e c c a " ,
believing in the myth of
" U n i v e r s i t y l i f e " . It does
e x i s t , but you have to go full
out to get it. Do not hold
back. Do not expect it to
envelop you in a mystical
of Euphoria.
A good way of meeting
people in IC is through the
C C U ' s and I C U . The C C U ' s
have, admittedly, an image of
beer s w i l l i n g rowdies. Some of
the a c t i v i t i e s are moronic, but
harmless and good fun. The
C C U ' s do other more
constructive things directly
(and indirectly) through their
<7F Only:.
Reputation, what
reputation?
F O R SOME O B S C U R E reason
IF seems to have a reputation
at IC, that i s , among the elite
contingent who know what IF
is. (Those who know where it
is are even fewer and further
between). They seem all to
keen to tell you that IF has a
reputation, however, they never
actually get round to telling
you what it i s .
T w o weeks ago I was
sitting on a stool in the middle
o f
the Union Bar, drinking my
pint of lemonade and lime,
interlocuting with an individual
who s h a l l here remain n a m e l e s s ,
as they say (I was talking to
him too). When the conversation
got to a stagnant point, we
turned to the can't-think-of-
anything-else-to-say question,
which in the sixth form used
to be "What ' A ' levels are you
d o i n g ? " and has now upgraded
to " W e l l , what exactly do you
do at C o l l e g e ? " When I said
that I was at IF his face fell
and there was an onimous
s i l e n c e , or even an ominous
one. He looked me down and
up, and down and up again,
and said in a somewhat stunned
v o i c e " Y o u ' r e at IF ... and
you're n o r m a l ? " Humph thought
I. A s far as I could remember
no-one at IF has green s a l i v a ,
or talons, or hairs on the palms
of their hands (see " A l l there
is to know about Adolf
E i c h m a n n " by Leonard Cohen).
Perhaps this kind gentleman
meant that I was normal as
opposed to worse, and that
most people are worse as
opposed to normal. I inquired
further, agog to find out at last
any details of our e l u s i v e
reputation. But I was to be
disappointed once more.
There was a s k i l l e d change of
subject which even I with my
infallible tongue/brain/tongue
could not combat. N o doubt any
correspondence s o l v i n g the
matter w i l l eventually find
its way to the IF Union if sent
to the F E L I X Office.

Tampax machines
Sir, - Is the IC S o c i a l i s t
Society so depraved of subjects
for mass debate that topics
with sexual connotations
should again be d i s c u s s e d ?
In a letter from Mr Teague
(mandated by ICU council)
the H a l l Committee was asked
to d i s c u s s the potential
provision of Contraceptive
and Tampax vending machines
in the H a l l . We wonder at the
a c t i v i t i e s (strenuous or
otherwise) of ICU C o u n c i l if
they should consider a subject
of such paramount impotence
with such gravity and at such
a length. During the period of
d i s c u s s i o n s on this topic
certain points were hammered
home. For instance, people
poked fun at the idea of these
machines being screwed on the
w a l l , and where the things
should be put.
We a l s o felt that the
potential volume of trade in
our H a l l would not justify a
Tampax machine (being an a l l
male HalII.
Concerning the other type
of machine we feel it fitting
that all Union members should
be within easy reach of it.
But, if the U n i o n w o u l d c o n s i d e r
issuing such d e v i c e s in
sufficient quantity, s i z e and at
deflated prices, then we
would be pleased to distribute
them. After a l l , in such hard
times ifsoften difficult to
make ends meet.
We hope this letter w i l l
stimulate further respo^^e.
Yours faithfully,
Some Members of Garden Hall
s o c i e t i e s . There is more to
say about this but not here or
now.
Whatever you do do not
fester amongst u s e l e s s work
sheets. Go down to the bar at
ten o'clock after working and
relax. Y o u do not have to drink
a lot. There are a great deal of
people with amusing and
intelligent c o n v e r s a t i o n
around.
If you live out, work in the
libraries, (you w i l l probably
get more work done), then go
down to the bar. On the whole,
stay in C o l l e g e , as much
as you c a n , there is more
happening than you can see
from the outside. A s they say
"How do you know you don't
like it, if you haven't tried it."
Yours faithfully
