WHAT S H O U L D have been a
" w a l k - o v e r " became in fact a
" s t u m b l e - o v e r " when IC
played E a s t Barnet V a l l e y
last Saturday. With an excellent
bowling performance and some
superb catching E Barnet
were skittled for 38. IC then
lost 8 batsmen to an accurate
bowling attack before reaching
the necessary 39 runs to w i n .
Three early w i c k e t s were
given away through complacency
and lack of concentration
giving the opposition confidence
More wickets were donated and
some lost before Dave Millard
and Chandra Kulkarni stopped
the slump and shared the runs
needed for victory. It would
have been an excellent victory
but for the number of wickets
lost; whatever the match a
strategy should be formulated
before batting — the match
could so e a s i l y have been
won in s i n g l e s !

IC 2nd XI v B C O
IC WON the toss in this match
against B a l l i o l C o l l e g e , Oxford
and decided to bat. They were
soon in trouble as wickets fell
rapidly. A c o l l a p s e was only
avoided due to some fine
batting by N i c k Morton (17) and
Peter Turner (38), IC stood at
93 for 8 after some very poor
shots from the middle order and
a couple of run-outs. Respect-
ability w a s , however, restored
by John Gowlett (30n.o.) thus
enabling IC to finish with a
total of 143 all out.
N i c k Treen provided an
early break through in the
bowling, taking the first two
w i c k e t s . T h i s trend failed to
continue as numerous catches
fell to earth and up till the
last 15 overs, B a l l i o l looked
set to run out easy winners.
Three w i c k e t s for as many
runs, including an excellent
diving catch by Brian Causey
in the gulley, put a stop to the
rot, but B a l l i o l batted out the
few remaining overs to finish
with 101 for 8.
However, an enjoyable
game was marred by the
discovery that £20 had been
stolen from our changing room
during play.

Skittled
IC v Q E C
A F T E R A SLOW start in which
w i c k e t s were given away due
to the tight and accurate
bowling of Q E C , IC were
finally dismissed for 156. The
impatience of the IC batsmen
almost led to a c o l l a p s e and
an ignominious total, but a
late rally from Richard Durhan
(42n.o.) ensured that Q E C
were set a s i z a b l e task.
Then in the gloomy light
and strong wind Q E C were
skittled for only 54 runs. The
w i c k e t s were evenly distributed
among the bowlers; Chandra
Kulkarni (who was " f e e l i n g
mean") took 3 for 1, Dave
Bramley 3 for 20 and John
Gowlett 3 for 15.

MOST O R I E N T E E R I N G events
fall into the category of
'cross-country' events, that i s ,
the controls have to be visited
in a certain, pre-ordained order;
but once in a while for reasons
of variety, sadiom etc, an
organiser w i l l come up with
something different. A few
dedicated s o u l s had the
privilege of two unusual
events on Saturday.
The variety was provided
by a 'Score' event on Saturday
afternoon at Hainault forest.
In a score event the controls
may be visited in any order
with each control counting for
a certain number of points
and the competitor collecting
a s many controls as possible
in the time allowed. Fresh
from his re-election as club
captain David Rosen showed
his mastery of this type of
event by being the only runner
to v i s i t all the controls in the
hour allowed, thus scoring
yet another victory. A l a n
Leakey did well to finish 11th
after overcoming the handicap
of looking for the markers on
the ground when infact they
were about 10ft up the side of
tress; whilst Rob A l l i n s o n
found problems adjusting to
the system and finished 33rd,
just beaten by Miriam Bescoby
in 27th.
Later that evening came the
sadism, in the form of a
'Novelty Event' near Wanstead.
In this event the sequence
in which controls were visited
was decided by rolling a dice

Maths 2 completed their lap of
honour after winning the R C S
s i x e s last Saturday. 14
teams entered and eventually
R C S A , Chemistry 2, Mining
House and Maths 2 found
themselves in the semi f i n a l .
Maths 2 had delighted everyone
with their fast flowing and
often powerful football with
Dave Brabbin starring at the
b a c k . T h e y took the field against
a strong R C S A side in the
semi-final but soon found them-
s e l v e s a goal down. Swaby
pulled one back and Dave
F i n n l s , released by Don R e v i e ,
and leaping about in goal like
a scalded gnat heroically
saved a penalty. Dave Bradbury
put Maths 2 in the final with
a fine individual goal.
•Mining House reached the
at each control — resulting in
some extremely erratic courses.
With a strong d i s p l a y of running
and t e l e k i n e s i s , A l a n Leakey
finished 2nd in 32 minutes
just ahead of Rob A l l i n s o n
who was 5th in 32.20 having
had some 'interesting' die
rolls (Go to j a i l , do not pass
the start, do not collect
control 3).
Sunday offered a more
conventional Badge Event in
the flat, fast Epping Forest
and saw a mass turn out from
the club. D a z z l i n g Dave Rosen
completed the M21A course
of 12km in 66.48 to finish
behind Mike Down of Lanchester
P o l y . F i n d i n g the controls
down at ground level again
A l a n Leakey had one of his
best ever runs to finish 11th
in 77.56, making it a good
weekend for him, whilst Rob
A l l i n s o n failed to hit his true
form again finishing 21st in
90.57, beating Steve Webb
and Ian Isherwood (the latter
having retired due to the
proximity of c l o s i n g time).
On the B course I C ' s sole
representative, I r o n M a n
Johnson had a good run to
finish6th in 9 4 . 4 9 , w h i l s t on the
C course Diane Benge continued
her ever improving performances
to finish well in 83.40 showing
the male IC competitors who
all gave up in order to get to
the pub, before c l o s i n g time!
A l l good training for the
coming weekend's British
Championships.

excellent sixth wicket partner-

the side to 151 for 6 at tea.
The declaration came not long
after at 162 for 8.
With storm clouds brewing
and winds increasing U C L never
attempted to score at the
required rate of 51

over needed to w i n . Intermittent
downpows made bowling and
fielding extremely difficult;
despite this almost a third of
the overs bowled were maidens. .
U C L always looked in trouble
against accurate bowling,
surviving numerous L B W
appeals and one obvious
stumping. However the match
was finally drawn with U C L
on 80 for 7 and Golding finished
with figures of 3 for 20.
