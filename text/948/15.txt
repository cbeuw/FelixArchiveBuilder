Therapy? - Nurse
Here I am, motherfucker. A
sampled Nick Cave dispels any
fears of a toned down Therapy?
in the opening seconds of the
album, following their migration
from Wiiija to major label A&M.
Not that A&M have ever
experienced anything like this
before. Hell, the first single, and
second track from Nurse'. But
Teethgrinder' isn't really a
representative of the album. It's
certainly one of the worst.
Disgracelands' follows it, laying
into everything Yank, and pretty
unsubtly at that. Neck Freak' is
positively Zoo-TV style U2, the
opening riffs echoing The Fly'.
'Gone' provides a more reflective
Therapy?, and Deep Sleep'
continues in this more reflective
vein, but the rest the album is
much more as you'ld expect. So?
Still searching for the new
N*»****? Search no more.

• Out now on A&M. Therapy?

Sultans of Ping, W o n k y
Alice. L M N O Pelican - U L U
Who are LMNO Pelican! They
had already started when I arrived
but what I caught of their set was
fairly good, even impressive
considering they were only
second support. The band looked
dead bored but don't be conned
into thinking they were in anyway
boring. Good grungy type stuff to
feed the heads of todays youth.
They certainly managed to get a
few people. I think they finally
realised that everyone was getting
down when they reached their
last song because they suddenly
became a lot more animated. Pity
it was their last number, they
would have been twice as good if
they had looked even remotely
that interested for the rest of the
set. Still a fairly good act for the
start ofthe evening.
Wonky Alice, in one word, are
weird. The singer either has a
muscle disorder or thinks he's a
Thunderbirds puppet. His
attempts at dancing weren't quite
as distracting as the multitude of
stage divers though, who seemed
to have a strange desire to shake
his,'tand before going over the
top! rve never seen this band
before, unfortunately. Something
I hope to remedy in the not to
distant future. This band are fun,
animated, solid and well worth
seeing. They're obviously a bunch
Airstream - C r u s h
First things first. 'Crush' is not a
Seattle influenced, metal song
that's all the rage right now. (In
case you hadn't noticed.) It's pop,
basically. A rave ballad, if such a
thing exists if it doesnt it sure
does now. 'Crush' is yoghurt,
strawberry, if you please, sliding
down the tongue; almost seems to
be anti-climatic at places, but this
only adds to the inherent angst
portrayed in the song. 'Crush' is
the record you should buy this
week, a six-minute dream, a
picture, pretty as flowers. In the
hazy fall sun. 'Crush' is beauty
recorded.

Cranes: Featuring Nigel Kennedy's
of OK blokes too because they
didn't seem to mind being
outnumbered on the stage by fans
or shaking hands with random
bods. Music wise they are
definitely indie (surprise
surprise) and as such should
appeal to everyone from James
fans to Nirvana fans alike. Don't
take my word for it-check 'em out.
The audience by this time were
well warmed up; the disco was
drowned out by the incessant
chanting for The Sultans Of Ping.
Something told me this gig was
going to be a success no matter
how well or badly they
performed. We were notto be
disappointed though. After a
stunning opening with Kick Me
With Your Leather Boots', the
mood was set. The singer, a man
of diminutive stature, has lost his
yellow pac-a-mac and was
resplendent in patent red shorts,
leopard skin print tights, silver
trainers andfishnetvest. Imagine
if you can across between Julian
Clary and Mick Jagger. This band
brother.
are set to be the next big thing
sinceflares.They ploughed their
way through standards like
'Karaoke Queen', Indeed You
Are', Tm In Love With A Football
Hooligan', and their current single
'Veronica' whilst mixing in a few
newies. One ofthe few bands that
can get away with a pink
spotlight! They resurrected the
Dead Ant with Turnip Fish' when
things started to get a little to hot.
Having announced that they didn't
want anymore stage diving the
stewards started to get a little
heavy handed however it should
be said that they did an excellent
job of rescuing the unfortunate
people who passed out at the
front. Man was it hot and packed
in there! They departed and
returned to do the compulsory
Where's My Jumper?1
and
finished with (sacrilege) 'Are You
Experienced?1
1 certainly am and I
suggest you are too.

C r a n e s : Self Non-Self
O.K., O.K., remember me? yeah,
'course ya do, Tm the original
power-madpopster, and I brought
Cranes to this College with
interviews, huge discourses on
their records and concerts, and
dinner party type anecdotes. I
took coverage way beyond even
extreme in magnificent,
unstoppably indulgent publicity.
Fuck me. What a star I am.
This is theirfirstalbum, released
originally in 1986 (see. I can do
all this from memory, piece of
piss), and once more made readily
available, though that's not to say
accessible, for, kiddies, could they
ever be? If so, then whence that
necessary artistic distance
between the artist and admirer,
the wall of dry ice that keeps the
masses of the 'we're not worthy
staring up at the stage in adoration
(sic), while keeping the band out
of reach and inhuman. A year ago,
I was a major sucker for this stuff;
unfortunately, familiarity breeds
contempt.
Not that Tin contemptuous of
Alison & co., mind; it's still
essentially Sturm Und Drang
brood-music, with mad Esperanto
caterwauling making itself heard
in the quieter moments down the
local steelworks, but... well, one
of the tracks has no discernable
vocal (a mistake), one sounds
intelligible (a bigger mistake) and
one of them's live (what!?!).
Theyve been very quiet all year,
not by any stretch of the
imagination does the shift of the
Earth constitute a new precedent,
but Cranes suddenly feel oddly
surplus to requirements..

Cygnet Ring—ICU
Well, what can I say? Not exactly
a lot, as far too much alcohol was
consumed by myself to remember
too much of the whole affair, so I
will keep this article very short and
sweet. Thefirstband Livingstone
were crap. On the other hand
Cygnet Ring were absolutely
fabulous! Their Indie-music
outranks any of those previously
featured in our most faboulous pop-
charts. They were amazing with
tracks like 'Love Crime' and 'India'
(both on their album), and their
varied sense of dress, attitude and
hairdos they put on a lively show.
It seemed to me that people were
having a storming good time.
They're neat! They're brill.
