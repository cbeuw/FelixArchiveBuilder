No Man's Land
This is a play relying on mood,
atmosphere, mystery and
claustrophobia. Pinter explores
the human mind in all its
confusion. An intense evening's
theatre.
A star-studded cast and
experienced production team
boded well for the piece. The
open plan set, elegantly bleak and
spacious, juxstaposes the inate
claustrophobia of the play
perfectly.
Paul Eddington gives a very
powerful performance as
Spooner. A tragi-comic picture of
failure, his haggard ageing
features fit the character exactly.
The Way of the World
The Way ofthe World by William
Congreve is an archetypal
Restoration comedy, focusing on
romantic intrigues of London's high
society in the 1700s.
Mirabell (Jeremy Northam) is in
love with Millamant (Barbara
Flynn). She has an admirer, Sir
Wilfull Witwoud (Gary Olsen),
rude and heavy neice in Lady
Wishfort (Sheila Hancock), that she
does not like. Millamant is instead
in love with Mirabell, but all her
money is held in trust by her aunt
Lady Wishfort, and if she marries
without her consent half of her
fortune is going to pass to Mrs
Fainall.
Despite the contorted plot, the
Pinter though a great playwright,
cannot act. His attempt at
drunkeness raised only nervous
laughter from the bemused
audience.
Settling into a convincing pace
with the arrival of Briggs
(Douglas Hodge) and Foster
(Gavin Grainer), their strong
support highlights Pinter's
shortcomings as an actor, and
their verbal torture of Spooner is
brilliantly chilling.
The lighting is impressive and
the direction tight. A niggling
feeling that such a distinguished
company could do better remains,
but a very enjoyable evening
nonetheless. Oh yes, wrap up
warm, this is an austere cold
theatre...

play flows smoothly, largely due to
Tom Hollander's witty performance
in the role of the curly Witwood,
Sir Wilfull's brother. Sheila
Hancock performs beautifully in the
role of the lonely, ageing woman,
pathetic in her attempt to simulate
her past beauty, easy prey to her
vanity and therefore to all attempts
at seduction.
Also remarkable, is the set
design, by Tom Piper, consisting
only of thin painted screens that
hang from the ceiling, and
characterise with puritan simplicity
the various settings.

No Mans Land
Three Birds Alighting on a
Field
Timberlake Wertenbaker wrote a
topical and uproarious play that is
masterfully performed by all the
company at the Royal Court. The
award winning play is about
Biddy, played excellently by
Harriet Walter, who is a to - the -
manor - bom woman who is fed-
up of her fascinating manner that
has absolutely no depth in it and
searches to find some
understanding in the art world.
The play is far from deep and
meaningful since for at least for
half of die play I was gathering up
my innards where they had
spilled out because my sides gave
way.
Amazing acting, a splendid set
and a superb script, catch it while
you can.

Chinese State Circus
The Chinese State Circus
Although this is housed in a Big
Top, it is nothing like an English
circus: the only lions here are in
Lion Dances! The empahsis here is
on acrobatics, and they are
stunning. Breathtaking somersaults
on a tightrope high above the ring,
human pyramids of twehty^eople
moving around in a wheel, dives
through hoops less than a metre
wide and two metres above the
ground, and other, such feats hold
our attention. Peking Opera
characters circle the ring between
acts, while apparatus is set up, and
prevent boredom. An enthralling
and incredible show, at a reasonable
price, which I for one intend to see
again.
