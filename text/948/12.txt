Sailing
Friday night the boardsailing
club left the polluted air and
polluted shores of Essex. We had
to spend a weekend in Brightling
sea with Essex University
windsurfing club. After arriving
Friday night we topped the night
away at Essex University Union.
Apart from being bigger, louder
and full of women it was the
same as Imperial.
Saturday brought light winds
and sunshine, ideal for beginners
or experts wishing to freestyle.
The race to Mersea Island was
won by Essex (we didn't know
where we were going) but Julia
for Imperial was the 1st lady.
However the race home to the
Fish and Chip shop and hot
showers revealed Imperial's
truepotential.
After transforming the Union
van into a M k l Ford Escort
(including fluffy dice) we visited
Kevin and Sharon in Clacton.
Unfortunately we forgot our white
handbags (and Dimitris) so we
couldn't get into the nightclub.
Several beers later we headed
home where the drinking and
silly games continued. What
exactly are bed spins Julia?
Sunday arrived blowing. We all
had an excellent sail except one
Imperial (Essex) girl who slipped
away. With Julia's swimsuit, to
visit relatives for Sunday roast,
chocolate gateaux and icecream
thanks for the" doggy bag!
Although Essex were leading in
the equipment breakage table.
'Easy Tiger1
Alaric soon evened
things up by snapping a mast
whilst 400 yards out to sea...we
did see you honestly Alaric.
Our thanks must go to Essex
University, and Daniel for driving
everywhere! I thought it was an
excellent adventure, and anyone
who disagrees won't go on
Wednesday! If you fancy
windsurfing meet us Tuesdays at
lpm in Southside Upper Lounge.
Johnny - Filmsoc ICSF-Rocketeer
Firm FilmSoc favourites AI
Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer are
this week's stars in 'Frankie and
Johnny1
, the funny and tender
story of a short order cook and a
waitress who meet at a New York
city diner and begin an unlikely
courtship, showing on Thursday
19th in Mech Eng 220.
Johnny soon finds that getting
waitress Frankie to make a
commitment to him
is a tall order. He's an ex-con who
learnt to cook whilst in prsion
forforgery, and she's a woman
with low self-esteem and a
negative outlook on relationships.
Dramsoc
If you want to be involved in the
largest arts festival in Europe
then readon!
As explained in last week's
article, DramSoc goes annually to
the Edinburgh Festival to build,
run and perform in a Fringe
venue. This requires a large team
of people (experienced and
unexperienced alike). Every job
that is needed in a full-time
theatre has its analogue in our
Theatre West End; the only
difference being that anyone can
be involved in any job!
Johnny must try to make her love
again.
Slightly indifferent roles for
Pacino and Pfeiffer than to their
more well known appearances in
the 'Godfather1
trilogy and
'Batman Returns' respectively.
Nevertheless, both are perfectly
cast here and fans of either
should not miss this film.
See you next Thursday at
7.30pm. Entry is only 90p for
members, 1.90 for non-members,
and you can become a member for
only 6.50 which includes the first
film free.
The site, is the hall of The
Church of St John the Evangelist,
at the WestEnd of Princes Street,
Edinburgh. We hire this for four
weeks. When we arrive the hall is
empty. During the first week
scaffolding, seating, stage, lights
and sound are built and installed.
Then, for the three weeks of the
festival we run seven shows a
day, performed by a mixture of
groups from college andsublets
from all over the world.
In previous years there has been
time to perform as many college
ICSF is pleased to be showing
"The Rocketeer' this Tuesday. The
film is a late-thirties action
adventure centering around an
unusual rocket pack, which is
being chased by the FBI and
Nazis alike.
The action starts in late 1938
Los Angeles, when a rocketpack
developed by Howard Hughes
(Terry O'Quinn) is stolen by
Nazis who are being chased by
theFBI. To avoid losing it, they
stash it in the plane of
unsuspecting aviatior Cliff
Second (Bill Campbell). Second
and his mentor Peerce (Alan
Arkin) from'Glengarry Glen Ross'
and 'Edward Scissorhands' aim to
shows as we have had directors
and casts for.
There are jobs for everyone.
From administrative and senior
technical bods to acting /
directing / producing types
through to people that just want
to take advantage of the
subsidised accommodation for a
few hours of (easy) work aday.
There is the chance to become
involved from day one. We need a
group of people to be 'in charge'.
We also need prospective
directors and producers to make
use the pack to makesome much-
needed money before they return
it. The Nazis, however, are led by
the ruthless Neville Sinclair
(Timothy Dalton, a rather good
James Bond), thethird biggest
box office movie star in America
and will stop at nothing,
including using Second's damn
good looking girlfriend (Jennifer
Connelly), in their plans for
world domination.
Will truth, justice and the
American way prevail? Come and
find out in MechEng 220 on
Tuesday. Doors open at 6.45pm
(for 7 o'clock) and members pay
just to get in. Membership costs just
Â£3 and the first film entry is
included.
themselves known (NOW!).
However, later in the year actors
and technical crew will be
required.
Whatever your interest (however
vague) please come to our
meeting on Sunday 15th
November at 7.30pm in the
Union Dining Hall.
