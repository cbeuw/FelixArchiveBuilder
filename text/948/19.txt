Guildford Runs
Another leggy performance from the
'Hyde Park Amoebas' at Guildford.
The team was slightly diminished
- down to 30 legs (plus twenty-odd
twisted ankles due to Farmer
Palmer ploughing the fields at an
inoppurtune moment). The
predictably brilliant women's team
managed to hold off West London
Institute and win, with 1st, 3rd and
6th places by Edwige, Jennie and
Maria. Oh... by the way... 12 fellas
appeared on the scene (Simon was
still suffering post-Norwegian
halucinations and immagined he
saw the Chippendales amongst them
- perish the thought!). Their
performance was a little inferior to
last time due to the presence of
Aliens from planet Essex to
compete in the Southern.
Universities Championships.
However, 'Gold Star Simon'
managed 10th, Dave Knight a
creditable 29th and Bill (I've got a
car so there !) Skailles came 39th.
The following Saturday, 7 of the
male amoebas returned to Guildford
for the Stag Hill Relays. Bill
defected to complete Brighton
University's team (ironically he ran
our fastest lap!). The IC team came
6th out of 9 teams - a good
performance when competing
against mega-athletes from Bristol,
Brighton and Southampton. After
the race, tea was served - apples,
swiss rolls and an infinite number
of cheese sandwiches (which posed
a bit of a philosophical problem) -
just the right food for growing
amoebas !
Rugby-IC 2nd XV
IC 2nds 0 Charing X 2nds 39
A dissapointing game for IC
seconds; the game started off badly
with a couple of fruitful drives from
Charing X . IC battled back and
fought well throughout the first half
creating a few chances but making
nothing of them. Once again the
game was hard fought, but heads
dropped in the second half as
Charing X came at Imperial with
text book moves which we did not
stop. After last weeks victory a sad
loss was bitter.
IC Rugby meet Sundays at 12.00,
Mondays at 6.00 and Tuesdays at
12.00 in the Union Gym.

Rugby-IC 1st XV
Imperial now look set to face West
London Institute in the next round
of the U A U after going down 13-22
at Charing Cross on Wednesday.
Even though they lost, Imperial
put up their most spirited and
committed performance of the
season. IC opened the scoring early
on when Stuart Paynter kicked a
penalty, this was followed up by
three tries, in quick succession by
Charing Cross. IC couldn't convert
the pressure they applied at the end
of the first half into points, and so
the half closed 3-17 to Charing
Cross.
The second half opened with IC
playing into a stiff wind. A n
uplifting half time talk by captain
Rupert Carr, inspired IC to drive
down field, culminating in a push-
over try, scored by Mark Ashford.
From the ensuing kick off Imperial
charged back down the field, in a
movement finished with an
impressive touchdown by Richard
Stubbs. With the score at 13-17
Charing Cross replied with a try to
seal the match. IC ran everything
in the last 10 minutes, but couldn't
breach the strong Charing Cross
defence, and had to settle for a hard
fought defeat.
International Dribs

(CANADA) 3
Last Wednesday saw the Dribblers
play their first International match
against a very skillful and
experienced Canadian team.
We started off well, they had a
near miss (Are you sure the ball
didn't go in Ref ?!) and then
suddenly Permi was running up the
centre with the skill any respectable
ex-captain should have, and we
were one-nill up. The team was
shocked. Sue had floored Juliet,
come on Sue, you might have been
playing for the other side but where
Talkback
At the moment the FELIX sports
page is a week behind with it's
reporting. A lot of the reports for
this week were about events on
Wednesday the 4th of November,
when they should have been from
Wednesday the 11th of November.
The page would read a lot better
if the reports were from the same
games as those in the results table.
I would therefore be very grateful
if any teams sending in reports
could do the same as the rugby lst's
does your loyalty lie ?
At half time, the Canadians were
surprised - they musn't get oranges
over there. The score was one all.
The Dribblers were convinced they
could win - alas it wasn't to be.
Permi scored another putting us in
the lead but it was soon followed by
two well deserved goals from the
opposition. They played brilliantly,
and we played brilliantly, but we
didn't half hammer them in the boat
race. Well done to everyone who
played, and you never know they
might ask for a rematch - on their
pitch of course!!
and 2nd's teams, and get them in
either the Wednesday night after the
game, or early the thursday
morning after.
I would also like to add that the
sports page is there to report on any
type of sport and not just rugby,
hockey and football. We would
therefore be pleased to print any
articles from the "not so well
represented" sports clubs. The
most up to date-reports-though, are
the ones that will get printed.
