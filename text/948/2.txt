Funding Furse
£43,000 has been raised by the
College Development Office in its
attempt to help with the purchase of
Furse House. The Ministry of
Defence-owned hostel, situated on
Queen's Gate Terrace, has been on
the market for over six months, and
has an asking price of some several
million pounds. College says that
the 200-bed hostel would extend
Imperial's accommodation stock by
5 %, and that ground and first floor
rooms could be used for conference
facilities.
Damage
A member of College staff had
serious damage caused to his car
whilst parked in the College car
park. The owner said, 'it must have
been a large vehicle to do so much
damage'. The incident has been
reported to College security. As
reported in Felix 937, the contract
for management of the car park was
passed to Axess Management Ltd,
a private company, on 29 June this
year.
The fundraising bid was launched
in May, with an appeal to alumni
by the Presidents of the Royal
School of Mines Association and
the Royal College of Science
Association raising £ 1 8 , 2 2 1 . The-
College has decided not to bid for
the property by tender, and the
property's vendors are not
negotiating with College.
Fundraising lias now been halted,
though many donors have agreed to
transfer their donations to other
accommodation projects.

Birkbeck President in 'Vendetta' Drama
by Declan Curry
The President of Birkbeck College
Students' Union has accused
students of waging a 'personal
vendetta' against her. Barbara
Bates, who faces a motion of no
confidence on 19th November, has
also denied threatening the editor of
Owl, Birkbeck's Union magazine.
The motion of no confidence in
the President has been tabled by
David Gascoigne, a crystallography
PhD student and a member of
Birkbeck's Union Council. M r
Gascoigne has accused the
President of being dictatorial at
Council meetings, and of
unilaterally overturning Council
decisions. He has also accused her
of not upholding the Union
constitution, of forcing the
resignation of four Council
members, of squandering Union
money and of authorising payments
from Union petty cash without
receipts. Mr Gascoigne says that the
allegations 'are in no way
accusations of dishonesty', and that
any suggestion of dishonesty 'is
merely coincidental'.
Ms Bates, speaking to / C N N ,
said that she was ''very firm about
what is right' in the running of the
union, and that 'people can say what
they like' on whether she is
dictatorial. She also denied that she
had overturned Council decisions,
and said Birkbeck's Union Council
had tried to stop her from
communicating directly with the
Union's students. She added that
'people accuse me of being
dictatorial, but you can't be
manipulated'.
The dispute has arisen after a
Union investigation into the
financial organisation of Birkbeck's
Union Bar. A financial report on the
bar was drawn up over the summer
by the University of London Union
and a team of accountants. As a
result of the accountants' report,
four formal complaints were made
against the bar manager, who Ms
Bates says has been 'severely
disciplined'. Ms Bates said that 'a
lot of money had gone missing'
from the bar, and it has been alleged
that the missing sum is close to
£11,000.
Ms Bates has accused some of
Birkbeck's bar staff of possible
income tax or national insurance
contribution evasion. She also said
that three members of Birkbeck
Union's Council, including M r
Gascoigne, were members of bar
staff, in supposed contravention of
the Union's statute. She claims that
the statute forbids members of
council from receiving money from
the Union. Birkbeck's Union Bar is
controlled by the Union council,
though the bar manager is a College
employee.
Ms Bates has slated the proposer
of the no confidence motion, and
has claimed that M r Gascoigne is
a flatmate of the disciplined bar
manager. M r Gascoigne has told
t'CNN that Ms Bates is attempting
to force his resignation from
Council. He claims that he is not
being informed of future council
meetings, and that his position on
Council was discussed in his
absence at a meeting held on the 4th
August. Mr Gascoigne says that he
did not attend this meeting as his
position 'was not on the agenda',
and that he had asked Ms Bates to
move the meeting to a more
convenient date. Ms Bates points
out that the date of this meeting had
been set at the previous Council
meeting, which she says M r
Gascoigne attended. She also says
that a discussion on the employment
of Council members as bar staff was
clearly flagged in advance. 'It was
decided at the July meeting that we
would vote at the next meeting on
whether union members should
receive funds', she says. 'It was in
the minutes of the July meeting'.
Ms Bates added that she was
assuming M r Gascoigne was no
longer on Council, as he had
worked in the bar since the August
4th vote. 'The Honourary Secretary
has asked him to inform us in
writing of his position,' she says.
'You're pointing the finger at me.
He's treating the Union unfairly. He
has a personal vendetta against me'.
Mr Gascoigne says that he does
not think Ms Bates 'is deliberately
dishonest', though he adds that he
'doesn't think she serves the
interests of students'. He says that
'the financial rules and regulations
of the Union constitution have been
ignored', and repeated his claim
that the president had 'squandered
the Union's money on the painting
of the Union's T V room'. He says
that Ms Bates rejected a quote of
£200 in favour of a quote of £700,
something which Ms Bates does not
deny. She said that the £200 quote
was not in writing, and that she
'didn't know what was on offer'.
After taking advice from Birkbeck
College, Ms Bates plumped for a
£700 quote from what she described
as 'a professional company that was
insured and guaranteed', though she
added that the final decision had
been reached after taking opinions
'by word of mouth'. She did not
think it irregular that the Union
President should source and process
quotes without any form of external
or internal supervision. 'This is
normal practice', she said.
Eleanor Merton, Vice President
of Communications and Welfare at
the University of London Union,
has described the feud as 'an
internal dispute between the
President and Union staff, adding
that staff were outvoting student
representatives on Birkbeck's
Union Council. Yesterday
afternoon, M r Gascoigne said that
he does not expect his no confidence
motion to be passed. T don't think
it will be successful,' he said.
