Have Degree, Will Work
After all the blood, sweat and tears, what does graduating hold for
you ? The story of one poor unfortunate is below.
I woke up, it was early. Despite
having nothing to do, I had an
idea that keeping regular hours
might keep me sane. Becoming
nocturnal felt bad, felt like the
wrong thing to do. I opened the
curtains above my head to let the
cool breeze flow over my face. It
was a beautiful summer's day.
My morning anxiety returned.
That initial dread at the
recognition of nothing to do and
nowhere to go. This was followed
by emotional re-assurances: I will
do something, I am going
someplace. The dread of
becoming a loser returned. The
impulse to do things was there;
inside my head I was a winner,
ready to go out, ready to conquer
the world. But somehow as these
thoughts reached my normal
consciousness, they vanished in
the lethargy filter, never seeing
the light of day, never seeing
action.
I got out of bed. Washing and
shaving were becoming early
morning rituals against the
dreaded decay. Diligently
performed each morning,
confirming the illusion of
normality. I was a graduate! I had
a degree for fuck's sake! Why was
I wasting my life? The television
stared at me, daring me to flick
the 'on' switch. I resisted. I felt
strong.
I switched on the computer. The
word processor's green filled my
vision. Back to the applications:
Dear ... blah ... extremely ...
efficient ... blah ... good
communication skills The
bullshitflowedthick and fast. Td
done this before, and before, and
before. The more I thought about
it, the more I realised I couldn't
think of anyone I knew who had
got a job by applying for it. It was
always by accident, in the right
place at the right time. All this
application bollocks was just
something to do while waiting.
All the jobs are little slots and the
unemployed are just funny-
shaped objects being thrown at
them. Some lucky ones are the
right shape and hit therightspot.
The rest of us just fall to the
floor.
Another letter dispatched,
another rejection boomeranging
back. I decided to be positive. I
was young, fit, had a place to
live. It was summer and the sun
was shining; a beautiful lazy day
and I had to do nothing but lie
around and daydream. Try to
think of it as a holiday, I told
myself. Thinking of everyone
stifling in their office routines
while I lazed amused me
somewhat. There was even a
certain amount of pleasure gained
watching people come home from
work. At least I dont have to do
that. But there was always a tinge
of regret.
Another day lost to oblivion,
another day of no progress. I tried
to identify what it was in myself
that seemed very ambitious. I was
genuinly concerned that I had lost
time to everyone else. All those
people coming homefromwork
were yet another rung up the
ladder, here I was waiting to get
on. But I thought I had rejected
the ratrace. Oh no, that stuff's not
for me. I wasn't interested in
arselicking to progress. I didn't
care if I didnt make a good
impression. So why was I envious
of my friends' work? I suppose it
was that it seemed to give them a
life, one which I was lacking.
Reflections over, I looked
around the room. The breakfast
dishes were there, coats needed
hanging, and I could tell the
kitchen needed cleaning. This
depressed me even more.
Washing and cleaning should be
things done in spare time, not
main time. To assign myself the
washing up as the main purpose
of my day seemed a terrible thing
to do. So I wouldn't do it, out of
principle. There was no way I
was about to become a house-
husband.
