The air at last Friday night's gig
was full of confusion, as many
people seemed unware of this year
door policy. Some of this
confusion stemmed from
information in Felix being
incorrect, with the remainder from
inconsistent policy earlier in the
term and the general lack of
awareness of the 150 plus posters
that had been up around college
for over week before the gig.
Hopefully the air can now be
cleared with the aid of a long
winded explaination.
At the start of the year it was
hoped that all Friday nights would
have a degree of entrance fee
attached to them. The first
Atmosphere of the term was very
successful with over 550 attending
at £1 on the door. On the first
band night of term (The Bardots)
entrance to the traditional bar was
left free, therefore enabling
anyone wishing just to drink
without seeing the bands or using
the disco, to do so.
However, several people
attempted to crash the gig at the
main entrance to the Union, which
seems odd as all they wanted to do
was to drink in the iraditional bar
(NOT). Because of the hassle that
these people caused and the
physical threat they posed to those
working on the door it was
decided to remove the use of the
traditional bar. Sorry, but blame
the sad, drunken, atypical IC
male. This shouldn't cause too
much of a problem as there's
plenty of them about.
The second Atmosphere, which
should have been £1, but wasn't
due to the lack of staff available
(possibly due to the shit they had
to put up with week before). Last
Friday's gig was as things will
remain throughout the rest of the
