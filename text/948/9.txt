Global Adventure On Your
Doorstep
Whose romantic instincts have not been stirred at the mere thought of
travelling round the world? Your sense of adventure and desirefor knowledge
must push you towards a tour of the nations.
A Week in the Life of the World is
what we are offering.
The Overseas Students'
Committee (OSC) has arranged to
hold a fairytale-come-true in the
Junior Common Room, Sherfield
Building during the week starting
17th November. This annual
function promises to charm you
beyond belief.
The historical grandeur of the
Greek Acropolis, the rustic delights
of France, the paella and warmth of
Spain, the magic of the Middle
East; all this will surround you and
make you feel at home, whichever
country (part of the room) you are
visiting.
Indonesia
Vast, tranquil inland seas, volcanic
mountains, historical remains,
paddy fields, palm groves and white
sand beaches.
The Orient
Malaysia is the cultural melting pot
of Asia and is a riot of delicious
food and overwhelming culture.
Reaching Hong Kong, the crush of
the skyscrapers crowd into view. In
a marriage of East and West,
aromas of spices and joss sticks
pervade the air. China is vast with
extremes of scenery from acres of
paddy fields to the millions of
bicycles.
India and
Pakistan
These countries will bombard your
senses and fire your soul. Vast and
relentless with many cultures under
their wings, India and Pakistan are
sensual and mystifying.
The descriptions could continue of
the countries you can 'visit' in
November.
Every day of the week will provide
you with a tour of four countries
and by the end of the week you will
have seen it all.
So join us on our world cruise. Not
only is it free but it will be Out Of
This Worldl
