Mascotry
Having failed to report the theft of
Reggie the Lion in Felix I have
decided that I was wrong. This
matter is a point of information that
should be public knowledge. After
all, the more you know about
Mascotry the less there is to like.
Mascoteers please read the
following news story.
Four City and Guilds students stole a mascot from
Kings College London on 29th October, a ransom,
paid to RAG, for its return is expected.
Let that be the end of the matter.
Women Priests
My congratulations must go out to
Bill Raines of West London
Chaplaincy who managed to get
himself on every single ITN news
bulletin on Wednesday. Maybe
College should employ him as a
press officer, because he certainly
attracted more attention to himself,
celebrating the ordination of women
priests, than Sir Eric Ash's
Commemoration day speech did.
Council
Council is the most influencial
group of people in Imperial College
Union. Our President describes it,
with his usual acumen, as a board
of directors. It is surprising then
that it should become so petty and
drawn out, is there hope? I think so.
As many people as possible must
see what happens in side the closed
doors of the council meeting. Only
then, by sheer embarrassment will
we be forced to mend our ways.
Typesetting experiences.
Due to a serious technical problem,
large sections of this Felix are not
of the same high quality that you
would expect. Our typesetting
machine, which produces all the
text for Felix, had a seizure. If you
are very bored, turn to page 1
7 and
play spot the difference, one of the
reviews has been typeset, the others
laser printed, but which one? A
suitable prize will be awarded for
the correct answer.
Luckily, the full might of the
Felix team came together to
produce this issue. All those listed
below have put in time and energy
far beyond the call of duty.They
deserve greater thanks than just
seeing their names in print.

I amfrequentlyaccused of being
pedantic; my standard reply to this
is 1 think you mean Specific'. My
reason behind such a reply relates
to my appreciation of language as
a very funny and fault-ridden
instrument for communication.
Language has given us God,
religion and evil. Language has
ruined philosophy. Language is
the divine comedy.
So I think it cause for concern
when a body of men appoints
itself to the status of an
intellectual elite and custodians of
this delicate little cameo; I can't
help but consider the egos and the
intellects capable of such arrant
indulgence. I am given to
understand they call themselves
the Queen's English Society, and
have acquired for themselves mass
media publicity over the past few
months. They have achieved this
by tactical, if naive, statements
lamenting the standard of
grammar in our Universities. The
more unscrupulous newspapers
have already made political capital
out of this in the least surprising
move of the year, and in last year's
summer edition of Felix', Doctor
Bernard Lamb wrote a lengthy
article on spelling mistakes. Of
the examples cited by Dr. Lamb,
'Youthenasia' was mine. In the
case I used this, it was intentional
and the piece merited the pun.
'Youthoria' was another, as was
'Euph', though these last two were
missed, and, if I may take this
opportunity to hoist Dr. Lamb on
his own petard, I think the pun is
legitimate. 'Queen's English' refers
to Received Pronunciation, which
involves an understanding of
phonetics, and not just Grammar.
Please credit me with this
understanding, if not for a vaguely
unfunny in-joke; I will not allow
anyone to confer upon my actions
their motives and their reasons for
public consumption, and I object
to being used to illustrate an
argument that I personally find
narrow-minded. Perhaps the
Queen's English Society might
like to turn it's attention to John
Fowles, Emily Bronte, M R
James, Christopher Marlowe and
Geoffrey Chaucer, as all have
utilised colloquial forms in their
works. Alice Walker too, whose
Pulitzer-prize winning novel The
Color Purple' was written entirely
in idiomatic language, could be
considered a target example of the
corruption of language. Oh, but
she probably doesn't count, does
she? She's a black American.
My view of life and language is
not limited to a watery little
European province; I am me, a
living, thinking thing before a
human being, and a human being
before an Englishman. I admire
conviction, but I will not be
imprisoned by the beliefs of
others. Moreover, I do not think
language subject to a standardized
andrigorousformula. Language is
anthropological, and its
standardizing akin tc tMnking that
the invention of the stopwatch will
enable one to control time. These
individuals may just as well write
letters to the Times complaining
about the sun's obstinacy in always
rising at sunrise. I imagine it will
not be long before we see them
manning guns from the Martello
Towers on the South East coast,
andrituallyburning posters of the
Rosetta Stone. I would hope that,
if they read this, they would
perceive good English, written
with a little wit, confidence and
. well-constructed arguments. Aside
from this, I would also like to
thank the Queen's English Society
for affording me the opportunity to
refer to them as 'A speech
impediment'.
