Peter's Friends
I wish I could say I liked this
film, given it's good intentions,
but I didnt. Peter (Stephen Fry)
invites old friends to his stately
home for NewYear's Eve. What
they go through there, and the
secret that Peter carries with him
are meant to make us feel we
have shared the extraordinariness
ofordinary people.
Unfortunately the humour is
stale and wooden, the characters
predictable and machine-tooled
(i.e. they work only for the
purposes of the 'plot' - not to
convince us of themselves) and
the result sadly is that we have to
watch extraordinary actorish
people being very ordinary. Self-
indulgent is the word that springs
to mind; a pilot for a TV series is
the general atmosphere; banal
and irrelevant is what the
'humbling' secret becomes in such
an undramatic vehicle.

Bishop, Crease, Whistler, Mother
and Carl (Robert Redford, Sidney
Poitier, David Stratham, Dan
Aykroyd and River Phoenix) are a
team of high-tech experts who are
hired by large companies to
penetrate their security systems.
Each has a 'questionable' past, so
that when two government agents
threaten to expose them, they are
forced to steal a decryption device
which, they later discover, enables
them to break into A N Y computer
system ...
This is another of those
Hollywood movies which gets off
to a very promising start (the credits
are anagrammatized) but flops to a
predictable good-triumphs-over-evil
finish. The all-star team look a bit
awkward stuck together and Robert
Redford has most of the lines.
Having said that, there is some
excellent camera work in the film
and the first half is quite
entertaining (mathematicians look
out for the ludicrous maths lecture
scene).
To summarise, I would
recommend this film to all who
enjoy the safe, comfortable world
of Americain mass-market movies,
otherwise wait for the video.

I hope that these talented people
try again! Humanity in cinema
must convince through
characterisation, not just be
churned out of a worthy plot-line.
Heart (even in the right place)
has to be mututally supportive
with art.

House of A n q e l s
What do you think happens when
a nightclub performer arrives in a
small Swedish village? Especially
when it is the granddaughter who
inherits the"House of Angels' and
who has not been known to exist
until the middle of the funeral.
This is not just another story of
foreigners moving into a small
community - but a wonderful film

Blue Black Permanent
A poetic film by 72 year old
Orkney Islander Margaret Tait,
more descriptive than narrative,
with some impressively artistic
pictures. A plot is difficult to
describe, however, if it is about a
photographer and her puzzling
memories of her mother who had
walked into the sea, as also her
mother had done.
