On the 25th October 1992
Malaysian Hindus celebrated
Deepavali or "The Festival of
lights'. Although the auspicious
day fell on the 25th October,
generally celebrations carry on for
about a month, that is from the
15th October to 15th November.
Deepavali is a joyous occasion
for all Hindus and is centred
around many legends and myths,
mostly in relation to the triumph
of the good forces over the evil
ones. The more well versed ones
being the killing of the demon
Marakasura by Lord Krishna and
the return of Lord Ramg to
Ayodha after years itself, Hindu's
are up before sunrise and have ah
oil bath before going to the
temple where special prayers are
held. It is also a practise to wear
new clothes and visit the elders in

Last weekend saw London host
this year's 6-pack, 18 teams from
universities over the country
competed for a dix pack of beer
and condoms. Unfortunately IC
could only muster one team this
year due to a lack of experienced
race helms after defections to
London, as such, hopes of
bettering last year's semi-final
place were low.
8.45 Saturday morning and most
of IC's team arrived at the Welsh
Harp Reservoir, Wembley, to rig
boats and help in organisation.
The racing commenced at 10.00.
IC'sfirstrace was not until about
2.00 due to crap race
organisation. Just as well really
as the team captain was three
hours late arriving. We lost
convincingly to Spinnaker, and
then to Southampton in our
second race, the last of the day.
By about 5.00 boats were away
for the night and the wild
partying was well in progress;
several attempts at Yard's (can
you beat 15 seconds?), Sol races,
and plenty of. chilli, what a
combination. Mel failed to get a
team for the night and drowned
her sorrows, and nearly herself, in
a Sol race.
Sunday morning at some
indecent hour hangovers were
beginning to show, the team
captain was only a credible half
hour late, good effort Nick! Mel

the family circle. Children
especially enjoy the pleasure of
gifts and fireworks. As its
namesake- the festival of lights,
bright lights andfireworksare a
must in most Hindu houses on
this occasion.
In Malaysia, on such an occasion
it is customary to have friends
and relatives over and there is
always lots of fun and food to go
around - all members of
Malaysia's multi-racial society
visit their Hindu friends on this
occasion to wish them a Happy
Deepavali and join in with the
festivities.
The ICMS had its Deepavali
gathering at the Malaysia Hall on
the 11th ofNov 1992, Wednesday
members were treated to
delicious Malaysian food and
good fun.
and Zara were an hour and a half
late, we were beginning to worry,
what with six imminent,
consecutive races, and only one
crew out of three. The only win
ofthe day was against Swansea
Women, this probably had
something to do with the two
anonymous IC helms, who they
slept with on Saturday night, and
one of IC's more experienced
helms confusing his Port and
Starboard (for those not in the
know, this is like driving on the
wrong side ofthe road).
Sunday evening, retired,
shattered. Congrats to IC's first
team: Nick Smithand Melanie
Hayles, Ben Deverson and Zara
Flynn, and Simon Wilkins and
Sinead Malone.
Congrats to Angus Cook, Robin
Mechlenbugh and Ben Hancock
who made up half of London's
winning team, and Morris "Prof
O'Connell who sailed for UL2.
Imperial will be joining
Swansea Women at Plymouth for
the Student Nationals this
weekend, with hopefully better
results.
