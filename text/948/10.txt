Hall's Dirty Dozen G.S.S.C?!?
Tomorrow (14th) is the first
annual Halls Dirty Dozen. This
event is all about proving which
hall really is the best at RAG.
Each hall is sending a team of up
to twelve people to somewhere in
the UK, to collect as much money
as they can in twelve hours in the
silliest manner possible. A prize
of a large barrel of beer is going
to the hall team which that the
most dosh. There will also be a
prize for the team that comes up
with the wackiest idea.
At the time of writing, Falmouth
Keogh intend to go to Guilford,
Tizard to Brighton, Fisher to
Dover or Edinburgh^), Weeks to
Chessington or Alton Towers
theme parks, Garden to tour
around London's police stations
dressed as slaves, Southwell to
mosey around London and Willis
Jackson to do a different party
dance in each of twelve London
streets (Conga in Covent Garden,
Football Crazy
Waltzin Whitehall etc). Linstead
and Selkirk were still undecided
and Bernard Sunley were trying
for a football match. If you want
to get involved, come up with
some more silly ideas or if you
want some more up-to-date
informaion on what's happening,
look out for the posters in halls,
or contact your RAG Hall Rep.
Please note that all the above
were ideas of the Hall Reps and
teams, and are subject to RAG
getting authorisation in the towns
concerned. By the time you read
this, all plans will have been
confirmed and you will be able to
sign up with your Hall Rep.
There will be a renegade team of
non-residents somewhere about,
who will not be entitled to the
barrel of beer but who will still
be entered for the most original
idea prize. See Tamsin Braisher
if you are still interested.
Football, be it rugby or soccer,
has found it's way to the heart of
the RAG committee and, knowing
how hard up you students are,
RAG has come up with more
freebies for sports fans and
collectors alike. Following our
recent collection at the QPR v
Leeds match, we have more
matches lined up throughout the
year.We havefreetickets to three
further matches over the next few
terms already and are pushing for
more. If you want a free ticket,
the rules are quite simple - turn
up to a RAG meeting or come up
to the RAG office and sign up.
The catch? Well, you will be
expected to collect for a charity
(silly question really, after all this
is RAG!). The collecting is quite
easy because you have a captive
audience and it gets even easier if
the home team wins!
So you want to know what the
matches are? Well, so far we have
a rugby league game on 22nd
November with The London
Crusaders, then we have an
England Soccer International
against Holland in February and a
Chelsea match in May. Any
others we can arrange will be
publicised in these pages and we
will also try to get collections at
other sporting events. If tickets
are limited, a first come first
served basis will be in operation,
so get in quick. We have only 10
places on the London Crusaders
match and 45 tickets in high
demand for the England
International. See you at the RAG
meeting on Friday at 1.10pm in
the Ents Lounge for more
information.
The next big RAG event of term
after the Halls Dirty Dozen is
only two weeks away now and it's
time you started getting your
teams together. For any one who
forgot to write it in their diary it's
the Great Sightseeing Challenge
and it's on 28th November. In a
style similar to monopoly, you
need to get yourselves in teams of
about four to six, not forgetting
fancy dress if you want to do even
better. You will be set a course
around some of London's most
famous sights and the aim is to
get round the course as quickly as
possible.
However there is a catch. At
each sight you will have to take a
challenge before you are told the
next sight on your route. You get
to choose between a quick
question, a physical challenge, or
an instant scavenge. These in the
past have ranged from leapfrog
Climb Winners
across tower bridge,findingthe
nearest pub and tap-dancing in
parliament square to finding a
pint of Thames water without a
pint glass and being a town crier
in the middle of Camden Lock!
Failure to do the required
challenge results in penalties
being incurred, however bonus
points are available for stylish
attempts and, as is often the case,,
the Marshalls will be highly
corruptable when offered certain
liquid bribes.
More details about this wacky
event will be winging your way in
future issues of Felix so
remember to watch this space
every week. Turn up to RAG
meetings at 1.10pm on Friday in
the Ents Lounge if you want to
know more about this or any
other RAG event or if you have
any ideas.
A massive round of applause to
the winners of last week's
Pavement Climb prizes:
Charles Twist turned up in the
best climbing gear, earning
himself a "Raising money by
raising hell' T-shirt. Helen
Teasdale and Bryan Crotaz not
only won duck T-shirts for the
best fancy-dress but were also the
only team to bringtheir own
climbing rope! Top collectors
were Vikki Owen and Nick
Wheeler, who won tea and
patisseries for two at the Fleur de
Lys. Hopefully any injuries they
may have sustained during their
courageous ascent of Brompton
Road are not serious enough to
stop them enjoying these
delicacies before they forget how
they won them!
