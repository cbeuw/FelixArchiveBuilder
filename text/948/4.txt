D r a m s o c Rant
Dear Jonty,
Last week myself (Dramatic
Society, or DramSoc, President)
and Andrew Nu DramSoc Stage
Director) were rudely summoned
to part of a particularly boring
Union meeting to explain
DramSoc charges. If it were the.
one and only time that our limited
free time had been interrupted
then 'OK, it's one of those things'.
However, repeatedly during my
involvement with DramSoc this
has been raised and laid to rest.
So, for the benefit of anyone who
uses Dramsoc/Union equipment
as well as the minority of hacks
who continually question our
policy then this is it (and yes it is
kosher).
1. DramSoc controls a large
quantity of sound light and stage
equipment.
2. Much of this requires
expensive regular maintenance
which cannot be carried out by
the society.
3. Dramsoc's annual budget is for
putting on DramSoc events and
contributes to the maintenance
required as a result of these.
When societies (or individuals)
use the equipment they are
expected to pay a representative
charge to cover the maintenance
due to their use of it.
5. When the equipment is
borrowed by a group then if it
requires setting up and/or
operating then DramSoc will
charge wages (a pre-arranged sum
for a number of hours work).
This may seem sane enough,
though we have regular
'complaints'.
Mostfrequently,these are when
people damage (eg. spill beer
over) equipment while they are
using it. DramSoc does not
consider that it should penalise
all societies because of such
(preventable) accidents.
However, it does cost to have a
powered amplifier cleaned. Thus,
in such cases, we expect the
society concerned to pay the cost.
Sometimes people say the charges
are too high. Invariably this is
because they have asked for too
much. It is much better to talk to
our crew about the effect that you
wish to create, rather than saying
here's, light that room - oh and
we want some sound too'.
The final class of complaint is
when we refuse a job. Clearly
some of the equipment does not
require skill to use, and as long as
no one else is using it there is
rarely a problem with any group
borrowing it. However, all of our
lighting and sound kit requires at
least knowledge of how to set it
up correctly (the bill for repairs
could very easily run to hundreds
of pounds).Thus, unless one of
our crew is tree (generally
possible unless another event is
happening at the same time) or
someone in the group can
demonstrates sufficient
competence with the equipment
we have to refuse the job.
In case anyone is still not
satisfied and thinks that our terms
are unfair then please note that
(1) DramSoc has no reserves of
money (profit) and (2)DramSoc
does not spend large sums on new
equipment at the end of the
financial year.
Regards,
Daniel Shields (EE3).

Dear Editor type bod,
There is nothing to be said that
cannot be said to someone's face
and therefore there is no need to
write anonymous articles to Felix,
claiming that it would damage
their character/life if people knew
who it was. If it is that
controversial and dangerous then
perhaps it should not be said. I
hardly feel that the police would
barge into the house of the person
who wrote the article about LSD
and arrest him for possession,
dealing or general ignorance
without evidence and as he states
that he personally has never ever
taken the substance himself. I
think that he is in no real danger.
So too to the person who wrote
the IRA Beit Back. Does he really
feel that th^y would now
deliberately plant a bonib in his
neighbourhood just to blow him
up during his next yoghurt
run...mind you, for those of us
who know who this person is it
wouldn't be such a bad idea!
Anonymity is only really needed
rags
Hack Attack
Dear Jonty,
When I first came to Imperial, I
swore that I would participate
fully in college life during my
time here, and I have, being
involved in the Union, my
department, the CCLPs, hey, I
even wrote something for Felix!
Call me a hack but I still behold
one group of people in utter
amazement.
If I try and imagine explaining
their activities to a stranger to the
College it would go something
like this; this group of people sit
in a large smelly room, all day
and night for weeks on end
periodically churning out the
bumper edition of the self
gratifying 'student newspaper'
(sic). It's called Felix.
What is so distressing about this
seemingly trivial activity is the
characteristics it brings out in
those involved. The activities of
the Felix hack', said or otherwise,
take over the poor life of the
individual, and often their degree!
She or he cannot talk about
anything else and if two of them
meet heaven help us.
The Felix hack will risk life and
limb to save his/her precious rag
from harm and develops strange
antagonisms to people or
organisations he/she has never
met before. See the sinister side
emerging - Rambo-esque attacks
of journalistic brutality, self-
righteous cutting editorials, the
same stuff EVERY year!
Honestly, it is in the Editor's job
description, he HAS to do it.
Eight or more obligatory attacks
on the Sabbs (or Sadds as he will
call them), the Bar (6p for a pint,
FAACK! where do the profits
go?, the CCUs ('tin-pot
dictatorships of banana republics'
- like Felix? No, honest.), College
management (he might have a
point here.), censorship and
mascotry. We've had the last one
of the list, what's the next? 5-1 on â€¢
the CCUs, 3-1 on the sabbs (Dom
- watch your back!!).
It is not as if the College crawls
with these people but it is their
views you are reading in that 10
o'clock lecture on Friday morning.
To coin a phrase, ' Never has so
much been done by so few to so
little effect.'
But what's the motivation?
Fucked if I know.
And now, in true Felix-editor
style, I declare this subject closed
before it gets boring and no
because I want the last word, you
wouldn't do that would you,
Jonty?
Purr on man, the cat cuts both
ways,
Andy Wensley, (Sad hack
extraordinaire and all-round
'good egg')
Dear Jonty
In your editorial about mascotry
in Felix 947 you refer to
Broadsheet and Guildsheet
'lovingly devoting pages to this
inane sport'. This puzzled me a
little. I cannot speak for
Guildsheet, but on a quick look
through last year's Broadsheets I
could only find three and a half
sides on the subject in twelve
issues - and one and a half of
those were a reaction to the
stealing of Theta by ex-students
(surely that counts as
newsworthy). This year, with
Max and I as editors, there has so
far been a total of one side of A4
about mascotry (and that only
because it wasnt mentioned in
the handbook) - funnily enough,
exactly the same amount of space
as Felix has used this year
enabling individuals to promote
the use of illegal substances.
Lots of love,
Rachel Bassett, Joint Broadsheet
Editor 1992-93.
PS-I really like your music pages.
