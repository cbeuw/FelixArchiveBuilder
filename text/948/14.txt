Nineteens - New C r o s s
V e n u e _J
The Venue is all a late night dive
should be; seedy location, scruffy
half-hearted decor, full of comers
and corridors. The youngish,
gloomless crowd were here to see
Drop Nineteens... and why not?
The support which cared little
about them - due to their
reticence- I still cant say which
was which. The first
(Rollerskate?), fronted by a sulky,
long-haired art vamp were
melodic enough, "Marijuana bard'
said Rob. The second were loud,
angry and sadly, "Musically
challenged'. One for the AWOL
masochists among you.
I hope they stick around; Drop
Nineteens gave a decent lesson in
summoning the elusive snarling
demon that is fine grunge.
Remember when you were young,
full of promise, overflowing with
the nectar of spring? Drop
Nineteens reek of the nectar of
spring, they leave it wherever they
stand, glistening in puddles on the
floor. They drive there guitar-
fuelled machine with brash
precociousness.
"My son, the drummer!' bragged
the golden girl at my side. I smiled
wildly and moved in for the kill -
a scoop, a bio, a backstage pass, it
would all be mine! Alas, she
donned her industrial earplugs and
smirked American as I grovelled
at her feet.
Meanwhile, suffusing sweet
female vocals with spasmodic
screaming, the Drop Nineteens
charged the audience, some of
whom duly charged the stage.
Shoulder dropped American
football style, a guitarist ploughed
them kicking back into the mob.
By the time they covered the
Beastie Boys Tight for your right',
the crowd were manic and the
stagefrontwas falling apart. The
management refusing an encore, a
wild Drop Nineteens number
kicked over the mic stands in a
well-timed tantrum.
This band are going to get older
and bigger, catch them as they are
now. Smells like teen spirit to me.

Appleberry Crescent / Peter
Stewart - Borderline 2/7/92 '
When Appleberry Crescent (great
name!) first got up to play, I feared
the worst, long hair, die-hard rock
'n' roll attitude and an imposing
presence. But they were actually
fucking brilliant- what a great
combination, Takamine acoustic
and Firebird bass. At least there's
someone who knows there's more
to rhythm than just chugging
chords. Essentially an acoustic
band who apparently sound
somewhere between the Cure and
Nirvana -1 wasn't sure if this was
good or bad.
When Nirvana first came out they
were a breath of fresh air, but
since pre and post-'Nirvana'
became musical benchmarks, they
became just another MTV band.
So much so, nowadays 'Smells
like teen spirit' should be more
like 'Smells like a stale fart' -
someone please open that bloody
window. The Cure however have
always been great (sic).
Anyway getting back to the band
in question, 'Shelter' and 'Love
will never go' (probably) are good
tracks with the very bohemian
looking bass player (great glasses)
hammering out traces of Dave
Grohl. More Nirvana antics with
sudden changes of mood and
intensity (believe me this is a good
thing). Definitive overtones of the
Cure's 'In between days' on one of
the songs accompanied by the
singer/guitarists excellent,
consistent voice,
Appleberry Crescent, a trio of the
most unassuming individuals, at
one of the most unassuming
venues; definitive talent from
Kidderminster, the keyword being
potential - surprising to hear
they're still unsigned.
Peter Stewart appeared in funky
retro outfit and before long was
doing serious Pete Townsend-type
GBH to his guitar, such that bythe
end of the first song three strings
were all that remained on his
guitar. After a quick change, he
was back in business accompanied
by a cool rasta on percussion, a
zombie on drums and some dude
on bass.
Basically acoustic pop but with
attitude and a great sense
ofhumour, he insisted every song
was about sexuality and somehow
ended up mumbling Charles
Mason after someone commented
on his funky trousers?!
Lively encore with lead guitarist
looking and sounding like Nils
Lofgren, funky chops and
minimalist solos - shame about his
haircut.
Good, in fact very good.

Mega City Four - Inspiringly
Titled T h e Live A l b u m
Like Melody Maker commented
last week, they want to be the
Beatles, in fact they ARE the
Beatles - rehashed (the pun was
intended). All too pretty
harmonies but without any
simplicity - the guitar sounds
identical all the way throughout,
just fuzzy and not a lot else. Wiz's
voice sounds annoying, dreary
andmiddle-of-the-road. No wonder
they're compared to the Neds,
Stujpes, etc, MC4 are certainly
more energetic, but in terms of
new musical areas explored or
new ideas they're absolute no
hopers.
To be perfectly honest I don't
mind them as background music at
a small volume purely because it
isn't going to blow me away and
hence disturb me. (I'm just being
polite.)
'Shivering Sand' and 'Thanx' are
better tracksfroman album which
variesfrombeing vaguely melodic
to a barrage of bricks. In Wiz's
own immortal words, Tm not the
brightest star' - say no more.
Totally uninspiring banality. My
life still ain't complete.
