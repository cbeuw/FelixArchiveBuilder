o
Felix 948
in cases wherethere is a real
threat that the person's life was in
danger, in the case of the IRA
article unless that person was
writing to say that he had seen
who had done it then there is no
more danger to himself that to
every other person who walks the
streets of London or travels on the
underground. And if the LSD
article were advertising the
availability of such substances
then anonymity would be
pointless as the person would not
make many sales.
So to my conclusion, if you have
anything to say then put your
name to it even if it is not the
views ofthe Union, Felix or those
who work in such places. Oh, and
I would very much like to have a
conversation with the person who
felt it necessary to withhold his
name from the article on the
Royal Family in lastweek's Felix
who are you to comment anyhow?
Yours unanonymously.
Sam.
Cat's Eyes
I would like to apologise for two
things that occurred in last weeks
Cat's Eyes. Thefirstof these was
the hideous font that was chosen
(NOT by me), to be used for the
logo. I absolutely detest this font
and would like to assure you that
it will never be used again. The
second balls-up was the word-of-
the week and the phrase-of-the-
week. Again I had no part in
these and it was all down to the
editor, who was showing off his
skills in space filling. But the
space would not have had to be
filled if the editor had told me a
better approximation of the
number of words that I would
have to write. Again I assure you
that no such tacky space fillers
will be appearing ever again.
Last Sunday was Remembrance
Sunday, the only day in the year
devoted to those who were
sacrificed for our country. I'm not
going to insult the idea or the
participants of the Cenotaph
service that was broadcast on TV
but I will degrade David
Dimbleby to the jibbering tit he
really is. It's bad enough that the
Dimbleby dynasty has it's hooks
everywhere in television without
having one of it 'youngest'
members giving one of the most
uncomplimentary commentary's I
have ever heard. His dribble in
the background, only broken by 1)
the 2 minutes silence at 11 o'clock
and 2) the speech given by the
bishop, ruined the atmosphere of
the service. His little snippets of
fucking useless facts irritated me
instead ofmaking me realise what
our soldiers did for our country,
as they should have done.
Evidentially he didn't get let into
TV because of his outstanding
commentary skills.
The Rector's appearance at
Monday's council meeting was one
the few highlights that occurred.
What he said was interesting but I
couldn't here everything because of
the herd of wild elephants that were
practising their step-aerobics in the
gym above us.
Rick Bilby, Chris Davidson and
Steve Farrant (El President'e,
Deputy El Presidente and El
Chairman), sat at the front like
Bill+Ben and Weed. Bill+Ben
spoke a lot of flub-a-lub and Weed
pinion
13 November 1992
periodically intervened to keep
order. I'm guessing that not much
was done since that amount of flub-
a-lub that arose was astronomical.
As the saying goes, 'things can only
get better'.
Who needs a band to entertain the
women in the Union Bar when
there is enough 'talent' from the
men to produce a hilarious sell-
out West End show. I don't mean
that they can sing/dance/tell a
decent joke but most make
complete fools of themselves by
sharking the women. Some
women find it bloody hysterical
watching a would-be hopeful as
he tries to convey to his chosen
one that hehas the worlds biggest
cock in his trousers, when usually
this is the complete opposite to
real life. Maybe be the
introduction of a new ID card,
displaying such 'vital' statistics as
maximum length, maximum
circumference and a snazzy figure
known as L.E.M. (Length of
Erection in Minutes), then
sharking may become a thing of
the past, (although I doubt it).
