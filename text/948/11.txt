Poppy Day Raid
On Saturday 7th November a
group of eighteen enthusiastic
collectors set out for Maidstone
on RAG's second RAG Raid of
term. On arrival at the Poppy
Shop, we were all kitted out with
collecting cans and the latest in
hi-tech well designed poppy trays
that cleverly emptied themselves
as soon as you leant forwards!
But such little problems were not
going to dissuade us. With
determination in our hearts and
poppiesfirmlyin our trays, we set
off to ensure that everybody in
Maidstone's town centre not only
wore a poppy but wore it with
pride. Of course this was no easy
task, considering the request from
the charity that we neither shake
our cans nor hassle people. (As if
we would!)
CCU Competition
But seriously, the high profile of
Remembrance Day made the
collecting both easy and
enjoyable, and many people
seemed happy to pay for another
piece of red paper every time they
lost one. All the RAG raiders
returned from Maidstone to the
tunes of Miss American Pie and
Abba, much repeated, content
with a job well done.
Thanks go to Marc Ellis and Josh
Burrill for driving us, and to
Pizzaland in Maidstone for giving
us a discount. More thanks and a
huge pat on the back to everybody
who collected. The totals will be
published as soon as we receive
them from the Royal British
Legion.
While the Halls competition has
been getting all the publicity, the
CCU competition has been
largely ignored. No longer is this
to be the case. Following the
interhall Dirty Dozen we have an
Inter-CCU Covent Garden
challenge. The idea of this is for
the three CCUs to take a Sunday
each and collect as much as they
can at Covent Garden market.
The winning team will be
showered with amazing prizes
(currently a year's supply of
condoms, flavoured, coloured etc,
plus T-Shirts and other goodies)
and will have a chance to take the
lead in the inter CCU ratings.
These so far stand as follows:
RSM £140.47
C&G £3,884.78
RCS £6,285.05
It's not looking that close at the
moment but don't forget that the
winner at the end of the year will
be the CCU raising the most per
member. This means that Mines,
with their small numbers, still
have time to catch up but Guilds
need to get their act together if
they want to catch those science
types. Further up dates will be
produced after the Covent Garden
Collections.

Fireworks
On Thursday 5th November a
crack team of Guys and
Fawkesses hit the Battersea
Fireworks display with a
resounding bang. Touch-papers
blazing, they shook, rattled and
fizzed their way round the
bonfire, leaving more of an
impression than the rather brief
fireworks display.
The evening was not one of
November's most tropical and
after thawing out their frozen
fingers with mulled wine and hot
sausage rolls, the collectors
sparkled their way home having
collected a stunning £1400 for the
Royal Putney Hospital.
Congratulations to Mark Bunyan,
our RAG treasurer, who, on his
first collection of the year, was
the top collector there. Thanks
and well done to everybody else
who came along for yet another
spectacular event.
Lion on the Loose
Last week'a group- of Guildsmen,
by superior skill, guile and
cunning, managed to outwit
King's College security, bluffing
their way into a high security area
and capture Reggie. For anyone
who doesnt know Reggie is a big
red lion and the Mascot of King's
College, weighing 6001bs. To
secure the return of their mascot,
King's College are required to
raise a certain amount of money
for RAG and C&GU have come
up with a novel way for them to
Rachel's Rag Roundup
So the first five weeks of term
have been and gone. Where were
you, what did you do and was it
as good as what we did? Rag
started the year with a bang and
this seemed like a good place to
stop for a breather and a little
look back.
Five weeks, five weekends and
more RAG events than I can
count (and I'm the RAG chair!).
Of course there was Tiddlywinks
followed closely by the alcoholic
haze that was Drink a Pub Dry.
Monopoly was next and by the
time we had got over that we had
raised almost a fifth of our
£50,000 target. The third
weekend was a triple event with a
RAG Raid to Cambridge, a
collection at a QPR match and a
Unicef collection. Craziness
struck again on Hallowe'en when
we had a Pavement Climb and an
amazing Rocky Horror Disco and
last weekend saw a pub crawl and
a second RAG Raid, this one to
Maidstone.
We have so far collected a grand
total of almost £15,000 for the
following charities: Action Aid,
MENCAP, UNICEF, RADS,
LEPRA, Leukaemia Research,
Royal British Legion and The
Royal Putney Hospital. This is all
thanks to over 300 people who
have got involved.
So what did you get out of it?
Well we have given away loads of
super prizes, collectors have been
regularly getting free or cheap
food, trips to faraway places and
free parties here and at King's
(boo!), exclusive incentive mugs
and T-shirts and, last but
definitely not least, loadsa fun! If
you think that RAG must be out
of ideas by now be assured that
we're not. We still have the rest
of the term to go and of course
RAG week in the fourth week of
next term will ensure that you are
never bored. Events are pouring
out of our small office at such a
rate that people coming up the
stairs are likely to be bowled over
by the flow. If you haven't got
do this. Fifty sperm donations
have been specified with the
payment per donation going to
charity instead of to the donor.
Guilds felt that this would suit
King's Students to a tee!
RAG would like to congratulate
Guilds on their success and
eagerly anticipate a cheque from
King's to pass on to our chosen
Charities. We hope King's enjoy
themselves and will throw
themselves wholeheartedly into
their task.
involved yet it's never too late so
come andfindus. We meet every
Friday in the Ents Lounge at
1.10pm and we can be found all
other lunchtimes in the RAG
Office, 2nd floor, East staircase
of the Union Building. We're a
friendly bunch and always ready
to hear new ideas.
If we continue as we started our
target will be an easy one but it's
down to you, we're game for
anything. Turn up to an event or a
meeting and get involved. You've
seen some of the things we do
and there's more. We're here all
year.
Be Mad! Be Silly! Be Part of It!
