Sports delay
Imperial College's refurbished
Sports Centre will open at least five
weeks late. The delay is caused by
the building contractors taking
longer than expected to dig the
concrete that surrounds the base of
the sports centre.
The centre is now planned to
reopen in early February, a week
after the contractors finish work on
24th January. The new
refurbishments include a Jacuzzi,
new weights room and changing
rooms. Contractors working on the
site have a penalty clause, if the
work is not completed on time then
a penalty is charged.
Imperial College Students Union
contributed £650,000 as an interest
free loan to the price of the changes.
The money came from the
Harlington Trust Fund, consisting
of the profits raised from the gravel
extraction at the Harlington Sports
Ground that belonged to the Union.
The Imperial College Sports
Centre has been closed since mid
August and was originally to open
on the 2nd January. The late
opening has been rumoured for
some weeks and was finally
announced during this weeks ICU
Council by Chris Davidson ICU
President.
Last week Felix reported huge
proposed price rises to Sports
Centre season tickets. The matter
was discussed at South Kensington
Facilities User Group, this Tuesday
which decided to pass the matter on
to College Athletics Committee on
26th November. Rick Bilby ICU
Deputy President stated that he
hoped a season ticket would be held
at £ 3 0 for students, with other
users, including staff, getting much
larger increases in their ticket
prices.
Opt Out Committee
by the News Editor and Staff
Sir Eric Ash, Imperial's Rector, has
announced the membership of the
committee charged with reviewing
Imperial's position within the
University of London. Including
one student representative and one
lawyer, the full committee will
consist of Pro Rector Professor JS
Archer, Dean of RCS Professor JT
Stuart, Chair of Enviromental Law
Professor RC Macrory, from St
Marys Hospital Medical School
Professor PS Sever and members of
the Governing Body, The Baroness
Brigstocke and M r R D
B u c h a n o n - D u n l o p
Speaking as an observer at this
week's Imperial College Union
Council, Sir Eric said that there
were 'no formal plans to
disaffiliate' from the University of
London federation, and that the
committee had been set up to
examine the 1927 charter, which
establishes Imperial College, and
the structure of Governing Body of
Imperial College.
The Rector spoke of the
possibility of a 'different
relationship' with the University of
London, with Imperial awarding its
own degrees and honourary
degrees, as well as appointing its
own senior academic staff. Sir Eric
said that he believed the College
'would be better off if it could
award its own degrees'. Sir Eric
also anticipated a 'reduction in the
level of College management' if
Imperial did not have to deal with
Senate House.
Sir Eric set out a provisional
timetable for the committee's
Fellows elected

On 2nd November, Professor John Archer, Imperial College Pro Rector,
and Professor Tony Ridley were elected to the fellowship of the Royal
Academy of Engineering. The occasion of the election was the Academy's
annual dinner, hosted by Merchant Taylors Hall. The dinner is held
specifically for the purposes of establishing new members, and was attended
by seven Imperial College Professors. Transport was supplied in the shapes
of the RSM's Clementine, and the C&G's Bo.
deliberations, saying options would
then be presented to the Governing
Body 'not later than next summer',
adding that 'Decisions will be taken
in the period of the next Rector.'
The Rector added that it would take
two years for Imperial to seccede
from the federation
Sir Eric also claimed that an
independence bid would not affect
the position of Imperial's students
within the University of London
Union (ULU), or with respect to
intercollegiate halls of residence.
'We own one-eighth of the
intercollegiate halls,' said Sir Eric,'
Sir Eric's claims have been
strongly contested by U L U
sabbaticals. Eleanor Merton, Vice
President for Communication and
Welfare at U L U , said that the
Rector 'must be joking' in his
comments about U L U and the
intercollegiate halls. 'He can make
bald statements like that, but he
hasn't a leg to stand on,' she said,
adding that Sir Eric 'hadn't been in
dialogue with U L U ' . Ms Merton
stated that U L U may examine 'an
NUS-type affiliation or some form
of voluntary membership' for
Imperial College Union students
should Imperial opt out from the
federation, and stressed that
Imperial students would not be able
to use U L U facilities without some
form of U L U membership. 'He's
fobbing everybody off, she said of
the Rector's remarks. T would
severely question his authority on
that one.'
