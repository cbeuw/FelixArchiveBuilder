•WELL, AFTER THIRTY hours work it runs. This term's
computer project. God rot its one-megahertz soul, who would use
one of these out of choice?
Not a bad question, you may think, follow it up. So we did.
The small business market
seemed a good example to look
at, so we dusted off the Yellow
Pages, and let our fingers do the
walking. Where first? First
Computer—the name says it all.
This company was set-up in
February of last year to cater,
usually for the first-time buyer in
the small business sector. They
cap also provide systems for the
corporate user.
Although they operate from
shop-fronted premises their
spokesman emphasised that they
sell 'service not boxes'.
They aim to provide a
complete package — from
systems consultancy to operator
training and machine mainten-
ance. 'Home Computers?'. We
asked. 'Definitely not,' they
replied. Tired of silly questions
about space invaders, I expect.
However, they will tolerate silly
questions about more lucrative
problems because they offer
immediate assistance to clients
on a telephone help line.
Claiming to provide tailored
systems for all clients, they would
not be drawn by requests for a
typical system. 'But don't you get
to the point where every business
that wants a computer already
has one?'. 'No,' they said, 'that' a
long way off.' Apparently, users
are often expanding business
requiring updated systems on a
regular basis. Quite how they can
be so sure of this on the basis of
eighteen months' trading I don't
know. But there was no
hesitation at the other end of the
phone. The coming thing is
multi-user networking, and they
don't expect to be short of orders.
Multi what? Don't panic, at IC
we've had it for years. The
College mainframe operates
hundreds of terminals. Now the
bigger micro systems can handle
it, too. Whoopee, let's go and buy
one.
To save their blushes, I won't
name the next firm we contacted,
because some of the things they
said were that, um, frank.
'Sell Computers? Well, yes we
did, but we're getting out of that
side of the business now.'
Aha. This sounds interesting.
'You see, we had a dealership
for X X X X X X computers, ,but
they're having trouble and now
they've pulled out. We did get an
offer of another dealership but...
'The problem is this. In a small
accounts department, the level of
staff is such that with all the
back-up and training and
the...(whithering sign)...hand-
holding it was much too
expensive. We only have a 30 per
cent mark-up and if you are
talking about, maybe £4000 for
an accountg system, it just can't
be done.'.
So there are problems with the
users' understanding?
'You're telling me. The kind of
people we're dealing with,
they're a real bag of worms. With
the education these days, they
can hardly read and write, some
of them, never mind electronic
genius!'.
This is not necessarily a
criticism of youth, though:
'And the older book-keepers,
they get set in their ways. You go
back to an office six months or a
year after installing a system, and
find all this expensive hardware
sitting there doing nothing. The
bloke is back to writing on the
back of envelopes.'
Asked about market saturat-
ion, this firm unwittingly
illuminated the rationale behind
First Computer's 'be nice to
beginners' policy.
'Yes, you certainly do get that
problem. The large firms with all
the resources have had systems
for year. If they want an updated
one, they've already got their
supplier.'
Diversity is a problem, too. It
seems that users are confused by
the sheer number of models on
the market. About 100
manufacturers of micros are in
operation, all filling the corners •
of someone's office, and some
claiming rather more than they
should about their machines
capability.
'Some people come in here
asking if they can do their
accounts on a X X X X X , which
cost £200. Some of them realise
that it can cost a lot more.
So we have two views of
retailing. They are different, but
patterns are starting to emerge.
What about reliability? We
contacted Computer Field
Maintenance to see if there might
be other chilly patches amid the
white heat of technology. Relax.
They weren't worried.
Basically, electronics last for
ever. Even the maintenance for
electo-mechanical components is
reducing. Even for printers, the
manufacturers say 'no routine
maintenance.' We just give 'em a
clean and a shampoo if we're
called out to deal with faults.
Winchester disks, for instance,
are practically ...well, no they are
maintenance free'.
Reassuring. How long does a
machine last?
'Six months to 10 years. Not
because it's broken, no. That's
about how long it takes for a
company to want to expand or
update their system'
Essentially, C F M provide an
insurance against breakdown.
They are retained by clients on a
contract basis, and will then
responsibility for the running of
the system. Either labour-only or
fully comprehensive contracts
are available, the latter being
more usual. They will tailor a
contract to a customer's system
and insurance requirements,
although if you spill coffee over a
machine or kick it to death
(amounts to the same thing) you
will probably have to pick up the
bill yourself.
They are called to deal with all
types of machines from PCs to

In the United States, a woman
put her pet poodle in a microwave
oven to dry it's coat. After a few
seconds the microwaves were so
intense that the dog exploded. As
nowhere on the oven did it state
that pets were not to be put inside
she successfully sued the oven
manufacturers for compensation.
Since then, all microwave ovens
sold in the US have had big sticky
labels stating that they are not to
be usedfor drying pets.
This never happened.
Apocryphal stories such as
this, passed across smoked filled
bars, are the direct descendants
of Beowulf and other folk
legends. They are usually
gruesome, moral, and the teller
usually claims some personal
corroboration; it happened to a
friend of an uncle, or they read it
in a newspaper (So it must be
true).
F E L I X rang Toshiba,
currently having great success
with their range of microwave
ovens backed by a big advertising
campaign. Had they heard the
story? 'Yes'. And is it true? 'No.
There is no recorded instance of a
dog being put in a microwave
oven'. Well, do microwave ovens
sold in the United States have a
big sticker on them saying that
pets are not to be dried in them?
Unfortunately Toshiba didn't
think so, but they weren't sure, so
FELIX asked an American
student who just happened to be
passing the office. She didn't
know for sure either, but she was
sure that a woman was suing a
microwave manufacturer
because she had put her pet
poodle in a microwave oven
and....
