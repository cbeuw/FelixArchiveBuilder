SINGLES
Gary Moore/Phil Lynott:
Military Man
It's good to hear the great
L y n o t t ' s v o c a l s c h o r d s
straining into action again,
and fortunately for all fans of
his brand of hard rock, Gary
M o o r e has p r o d u c e d an
excellent track for him.
Thundering electric guitar
work as you expect, but a
good song nevertheless.
La Bouche: Romantic Love
Now this is very odd. Every
sound on the single, is
produced by digital synthesis
of the human voice which
results in a disco Two Tribes
style feel, but with Romantic
Love choruses more reminis-
cent of a kiddie choir.
Irritatingly catchy this could
be a surprise hit.
Depeche Mode: Shake The
Disease
They've been having a little
trouble maintaining their
popularity recently, and I
suspect this track will do little
to help that situation. They
sound more and more like the
late 70's band they are, and
s e e m to have lost the
excitement and originality of
their early songs. It's a pity.
Paul Hardcastle: 19
People have criticised Paul
for making a commerical
success out of the tragedy
that was Vietnam. Certainly
listening to the electro funk of
• this single grates rather
against the photos we've all
seen of the youngsters in
S a i g o n d u r i n g the war.
H o w e v e r a n y t h i n g t h a t
reminds me of such images
can't be all bad—and it is a
great track.
One The Juggler: Hours And
Hours
John Peel's favourite band,
now r e c o r d i n g for R C A ,
sounds remarkably amateur
on this. The song is weak with
a Eurovision tune and oom-pa
drum beat. Even the pianist is
out of time with the rest of the
band. There is no room for
trash like this in my collection.
Eurythmics: Would I Lie To
You?
I believe there will be a new
album coming out soon and
judging from this, it will have
been well worth the wait since
Touch. Annie Lennox's voice
can only be described as
r e m a r k a b l e , a n d D a v e
S t e w a r t ' s s o n g w r i t i n g
abilities, ranging from the last
ballad Julia to this M O N S T E R
rock smash, are incredible.
Brilliant.
CINEMA . . . . .
Harvey Milk
Everyman, Hampstead/26 April
What do people really know about 'Gays'. There are the scary
ones that parade their moustaches and tight leather at Earls
Court or swing their hand bags underthe arches at Heaven, but
who are the 'normal' homosexuals? Were you ever taught by
one? Perhaps theres one reading this review thinking—that's
not what it's like...
Harvey Milk was a gay activist, a normal, friendly guy, well
liked. He owned a camera store in Castro San Fransisco and
became one of the city's most influential elected officials. He
was outspoken and a prominent leader in the Gay Rights
movement and was behind many of its successses. •
The film The Times of Harvey Milk follows his life and rise to
city supervisor—well liked and respected throughout many
walks of the population. Well out of the closet and into the street
when a fellow city supervisor shot both Milk and the city Mayor,
George Moscome, at their offices in city hall. The documentary
then follows the ridiculous trial of Dan White, the murderer,
whose comic defence successfully employed arguments such
as 'bad health' and 'too much fast food' to keep nis sentence to a
minimum.
A thought provoking, yet very conventional, 1.5 hour
documentary released as a film. Perhaps too long. It would have
made a good 'Arena' or '40 Minutes' but as a film, it is aimed at
rather a minority viewing. Other sectors of society are hardly
encouraged to go with such an interesting yet perhaps
uninviting subject.
CINEMA
The
return of
Captain
Invincible
The whole film is a send up of
t h o s e s i c k l y A m e r i c a n
superheroes and tells the tale
of one such character who,
having been purged during
the M c C a r t h y period (for
wearing a red cape, flying
without a pilot's licence and
wearing underwear in public)
becomes a wino in Australia.
However when the evil Dr
Midnight (ably played by
Peter Cushing) threatens to
rid New York of its ethnic
population by means of a
s p e c t a c u l a r l y x e n o p h o b i c
scheme the president of the
United States calls on his
c h i l d h o o d hero C a p t a i n
Invincible (in the form of Alan
Arkin) to save the day.
T h e f i l m f o l l o w s t h e
Captain's rehabilitation and
his race against time to meet
up with his old arch enemy Dr
Midnight, climaxing with a
remarkably silly good against
evil confrontation.
Gasp at the attack of the
killer vacuum cleaners, gap at
the President singing the
word 'bullshit' for 45 seconds,
lust after the (female) CIA
agents and become confused
as to just where Dr Midnight's
sidekick fits in.
The script is punctuated by
songs from the pens of
Richard Hartley and Richard
O ' B r i e n (both of ' R o c k y
Horror Show' fame) whose
i n a p p r o p r i a t n e s s is o n l y
matched by their farcical
delivery and lyrical content.

On a technical level the film
holds up very well, especially
the early stage-setting portion
which includes some spoor
'News on the March' 50's
newsreels and an excellent
McCarthy inquisition court-
room scene which is so good
as to be wholly believable.
The special effects, whilst
nothing spectacular, enable
the film to carry on without
belief having to be suspended
more than is necessary in the
first place, and in fact the very
lack of polish on these areas
adds to the amateurish charm
of this highly original film.
If you have ever read a
Marvel comic, or played a
super heroes game then this
film is a must for you.
Otherwise just go along to
laugh at this lampoon of the
A m e r i c a n m e n t a l i t y a n d
rejoice in the knowledge that
we British would never fall
into this same superhero trap.
