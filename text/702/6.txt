MEDICAL EMERGENCIES
A REMINDER OF THE RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
In a medical emergency first try and get your local first aider. Details
of first aiders in each department are kept at messenger desks and by
most first aid boxes.
UNCONSCIOUS PATIENTS
If the patient is unconscious check ABC. Check that the Airway is
clear, that he or she is Breathing, and that the heart is beating
(Circulation). If not, and you know how to give artificial resuscitation,
begin this IMMEDIATELY. Try to get someone else to contact your
nearest first aider and the Health Centre.
ALL MEDICAL EMERGENCIES
Ring the Health Centre on the emergency number 3333 (normal
hours), give a brief description of the emergency and the exact
location. Where possible the caller should remain by the phone to
speak to the Health Centre. The doctor or nurse will need exact
directions and may also be able to give useful advice.
Out of normal hours ring 999. This phone is manned continuously.
A messenger on duty will either call an ambulance or the doctor on
duty as requested. In each case leave your own extension number
and clear directions for access.
'Normal hours' are 9.00am-5.00pm on weekdays, throughout the
year, excluding bankholidays and the college closure. Doctors and
nurses are often in the Health Centre both before 9.00am and after
5.00pm in term-time and also in the mornings during college closure.
Because these times vary ring 999 outside standard hours and the
messenger on duty will be able to contact the doctor or nurse
appropriately.
