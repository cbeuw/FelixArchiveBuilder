•Mysteries on Monmouth Street, near
Foyles is the place to go if you want to
become a necromantic medium. Crystal
balls, runes and divining rods are all
yours for the asking. Even the books are
extraordinary, with titles like Teach
Yourself Levitation and 50 Spells Every
White Witch Ought To Know. With exams
just around the corner, this kind of thing
could quickly catch on.

IDE AS
• O u t with the wide suits again, we're off
to the Cotton Club. Coppola's expensive
and trouble some movie about Harlem's
most reputable jazz club, opens tonight
at the Odeon Leicester Square. As a
documentary it would be fine—(if
Richard Gere was only the right
colour)—sort of 'Ready Steady G o ' of the
Roaring Twenties. The film is dogged by
script changes however, caused by a
fidgety director and often unlocatable
actors. If you look very closely you can
see the sellotape...
FELIX
• L i s t e n i n g to N o r t h e r n c o m e d i a n
Chubby Brown is like meeting a bouncer
with an uncontrollable laughting fit. 'If
easily offended please stay away' he says
and he means it. Doubtless poisoning
Ovalteenies w h e n still in shorts,
nevertheless he has packed out City
Halls all over the North of England and
looks like being a major success in
London. 'Or just a flop', he said.
Friday 3 May 1985
• T h e ICA American season continues
