Hamlet Gardens
togo?
THE FLATS IN Hamlet Gardens may not be available for
student accommodation next year. The landlords who own the
flats want to raise the rent, which means that students may be
asked to pay up to £35 for a double room, an increase of nearly
50%.
If the College, who are Head Tenants of Hamlet Gardens, feel that
students would be unwilling to pay more, they may give up the flats.
Negotiations are in progress between the College and the landlord to
fix tenacy charges for next year. The College are the Head Tenants
who are responsible for collecting rent from students and paying the
landlord. Head Tenancies are designed to break even and any subsidy
would be out of the question, so will have to be passed on directly to
the students. Charges at present are about £22-£24 for rent only, and
gas and electricity bills must be paid separately. Hamlet Gardens
nouses over 200 students and unless College can be sure of breaking
even, they may be forced to discontinue the tenancy.
Student Services Officer Michael Arthur has said that he will write
to applicants for Hamlet Gardens flats to inform them of the likely
situation.
'Clearly no student is going to be forced to live there against this
will, if he feels that the rent is too high.'
Mr Arthur went on to explain that he foresaw a drift away from
large head tenancies towards small company let schemes.
Jolly good Fellows
SEVERAL EX-IC STUDENTS
and a former Home Secretary are
among the six newly elected
Fellows of Imperial College.
Professor J Sutton was at
College from 1937-41 and
returned to the Department of
Geology after the war. This is
where he remained for thirty-five
years before being appointed as
the first Director and Emeritus
Professor in the Centre for
Environmental Technology.
Another new Fellow, M r John
Egan, was a member of the R S M
from 1958-61, and is currently
Chairman and Chief Executive of
Jaguar Cars. M r H M Neal,
Chairman of the City and Guilds
of London Institute was also a
student in the City and Guilds
College and is a Governor.

AUTpay
conflict
THE ASSOCIATION OF
University Teachers (AUT) may
urge lecturers to withold
examination results or take strike
action following an offer of a 4%
pay increase from the
Government. The A U T have
dismissed this rise as derisory and
are seeking an interim increase of
7/2%. They also want an
independent commission of
enquiry to examine lecturer's
pay. The Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) have refused to assist the
A U T in any further pay
negotiations with the Govern-
ment, until this year's claim is
settled.
Professor Leppington of the
Imperial Gollege A U T said that it
was premature to speak of
industrial action. He said that
even if the A U T National
Executive recommended action,
the final decision would rest with
the local branch.
Card
trick
BRITISH RAIL FARES are to be
restructured from May 12th with a
major change involving use of
student railcards.
They will only entitle holders
to one-third off their fare instead
of one-half. The one-third
reduction will be extended to
saver tickets. These will become
the normal tickets replacing
weekend returns and awaydays
with white days and blue days.
On white days (Friday and
Summer Saturdays and Sundays
plus the odd Thursday) savers
will be more expensive than on
blue days (the rest) but railcard
holders will receive a full one-
third off both fares. The standard
ticket will only be necessary for a
return journey more than one
month after the date of issue.
