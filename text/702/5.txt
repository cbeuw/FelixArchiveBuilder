NEWS FEATURED
NUS Conference
—a tame affair
•AFTER THE NEWS coverage generated by the riots and
disruption of the NUS conference in December, last month's
Easter conference was a pretty tame affair.
The main issue dominating the
conference was the refusal of
Sunderland Poly student union
to recognise an independent
Jewish Society. In an emergency
motion the NUS resolved to
suspend the membership of
Sunderland Poly Union if it did
not reverse its decision within six
months. The issue arises because
of the strong anti-Zionist feeling
of some groups on the extreme
left, who see Israel as a Zionist
state and are therefore opposed
to Jews who support the right of
Israel to exist.
The expected disruption from
far-right members of the
Federation of Conservative
Students failed to materialize for
the most part. A few were present
at conference but failed to cause
more than a ripple of disquiet.
Even the elections, which it
appeared would be thrown into
chaos by the twelve FCS
candidates standing for each
post, went smoothly as all but
two FCS members withdrew.
The two who remained were
treated as joke candidates, and
the hustings passed off in good
humour.
The reason for the lack of
disruption does not stem from
any change of policy or
leadership in FCS, but largely
from pressure from the
Conservative party on FCS to
end the tactics which brought
Conservatives such bad publicity
at the Christmas conference. As
widely reported in the national
press, the party is currently
investigating the affairs of FCS
following their Loughborough
conference.
The other issue to raise itself
throughout the conference was
the Welsh language. Delegates
from Welsh colleges protested
that the NUS was not translating
all its publications into Welsh,
making them useless to some
Welsh unions who have policy
only allowing them to distribute
leaflets or display posters if they
are available in both English and
Welsh. A demonstration at one
stage involved a large number of
bin-liners full of N U S
publcations being dumped in
front of the platform. The NUS is
now to examine the setting up of
a London based translation
service after a motion of censure
was passed on the Executive.
Elections
The National Organisation of
Labour Students (NOLS)
retained control of the NUS
Executive for the coming year,
their fourth year in overall
control. There were signs,
however, of a resurgence in
strength of their main
opposition, the non-party Left
Alliance. NOLS and the LA only
stood against each other in the
election for one of the five full-
time (sabbatical) posts, that of
Vice President Education, when
the LA candidate, Andy Whyte,
narrowly defeated his NOLS
opponent. Three of the four
remaining full time posts,
including that of President Phil
Woolas, were won by the
incumbent standing for a second
(and final) term, without serious
opposition. The real contest will
come next year with both sides
putting up new candidates for the
main positions.
In the elections for part time
members, a new factor was the
emergence of credible indepen-
dent candidates from the Further
Education sector of NUS, two of
whom were elected. This year for
the first time in many years no
Conservative was elected, but
one Social Democrat was
successful. The overall control of
the Executive remains with
Labour, but their position looks
less unshakeable than it did last
year.
Motions
The Easter conference has a large
part of its businesss devoted to
motions. Unlike the last
conference, where the Miners
strike dominated, there were not
policy debates of any great
controversy. The priorities ballot
turned up Sexual Politics (ie gay
rights) as thefirsttopic for debate
selected by the constituent
members, with Local Govern-
ment (abolition of the GLC, rate
capping, etc.) and Internation-
alism being chosen by the
Executive.
First there were several
significant constitutional
motions. The move to end
individual membership, passed
at Christmas, was ratified and
now becomes effective. A new
clause was introduced to the
standing orders to allow the
removal of delegates from
conference for violent attacks.
The composition of the
Executive is to be changed also,
with a full-time Further
Education Officer, and a
Women's Officer (although the
exact status of this post still needs
further consideration). The
twelve part time members
presently elected by STV in
groups of 3, 4 and 5 will now be
elected in two groups of 7 and 5.
This may affect the political
balance of the Executive slightly
but this remains to be seen next
Easter.
The Local Government
motion resulted in a predictable
pro-GLC, anti-rate capping
position. The more extreme
position supporting Councils
refusing to set a legal rate was
defeated. 'Internationalism'
contained all that is worst in the
irrelevant politicking of NUS
conferences. It set out to define
which side the NUS should be on
in international conflicts, with
which groups it should set up
fraternal links, etc. An
amendment saying that NUS
should not have anything to do
with such things but should be
working for the benefit of its
members was easily defeated. So
too was the amendment calling
for workers and students to unite
in the coming proletarian
uprising of the oppressed in
society to create a new world
order where those scourges of the
capitalist system hunger, disease,
rate capping, etc, etc. would be
banished and we'd all go around
being nice to each other.
This was followed by the
Sexual Politics debate, again with
a predictable outcome. The next
debate, on Subscriptions, was
interesting because it showed
that many unions are feeling the
pinch when it comes to NUS
affiliation fees. The resulting
policy means that fees may not go
up as quickly as inflation in
future years.
The remaining debates were
Aid to the Third World
(Ethiopia, etc), Racism and
Fascism (they're against them),
and the Youth Training Scheme.
In each motion there are clearly
identifiable political positions
contained in the various
amendments. The main motion is
bland, amendment one is the
NOLS position, amendment two
and three may be the Militant
and Socialist Workers positions,
with amendment four being
perhaps a moderate Conserva-
tive position. Usually only
amendment one is passed!
Ironically given the claimed
attack on education by the
Government, the NUS did not
seem able to come up with
anything of much substance to
debate. Perhaps this is a
symptom of having two big
conferences with a large amount
of time devoted to policy
debates—there is simply too
much time to find enough
worthwhile debates to fill the
space, resulting in a lot of sterile
posturing rather than real
discussion.•
