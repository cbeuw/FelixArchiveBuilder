It's nice to see that the new-
fangled, electronic media still
haven't got the upper hand over
good old newspapers. I C F A X
got off to a good start—but it's
been off the air for quite a while,
now. As for the telephone
information service on Internal
4444—well let's just say there
must be a shortage of facts in the
Sherfield Building!
An interesting conversation was
overheard between two of the
refectory waitresses.
'Hava you seena the newa
Refectory Manager?' said one
Spanish waitress.
'Ah yes, me dear,' replied
another, Irish. 'It's Hugh
Southey he's after calling
himself, is it not?'
Mr Northey takes over as
refectory manager this month.
Mr Southey, on the other hand...
The lifts in Elec Eng have always
been a source of fun—one lift
goes to odd floors, the other to
even floors. Yesterday the odd
lift was out of order. But instead
of allowing the even lift to stop at
every floor, the following
instructions were issued:
'The even lift will call at levels
2, 6, 9 and 11. A L L O T H E R
P A S S E N G E R S M U S T U S E
T H E G O O D S LIFT.'
Presumably somebody has an
explanation.
