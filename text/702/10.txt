'Alio, 'Alio
Following the eronious decision by the
former Board of Directors to index-link
funds to the attendance at Stoke City
matches, it is announced, with deepest
regret that QT Soc will cease trading
immediately. Any persons or organisations
(Religious/Israeli or both) with outstanding
claims are respectfully referred to the official
receiver.
The activities of the former society will be
continued (on page 94) by a radical new
Society, QT (1986) Ltd. The new committee
are determined that they will not repeat the
mistakes made by the former society's
committee (and they should know!).
The main activities for this term will be
next weekend. We have a supply of tickets to
see 'Alio ' Alio at the BBC Televison Centre
next Friday evening. These free tickets can
be collected at out meeting on Tuesday 7
May, 1.00pm Southside Upper Lounge
(nearest tube South Kensington), when we
shall discuss our campaign for the Rag Fete
next Saturday. Anyone with their own pair of
wellies welcome. This meeting guaranteed to
be less violent than the average FCS
Conference and eight out of ten student
didn't have a cat.
