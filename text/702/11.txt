We can survive the
^Official
State of the Art rather than State of theWorld.
You're probably approaching your finals-with
more than a passing thought to your career.
Look around you.
For an electronics or computer science
graduate, there aren't that many options. As
you are among the employment elite of the
science grads, ifs probably already occurred
to you that you're heavily in demand by the
defence companies. There must be more in
life. There certainly is for a career.
Here at Northern Telecom Data Systems Limited,
technology is developed along more constructive
lines. Our latest product, VIENNA*, is a unique
family of systems, designed specifically to
address the needs and increase the efficiency
of the European business environment. Flexibility
and industry standards have been built in from
the outset, giving VIENNA the unrivalled
configurability and compatibility demanded by
evolving business needs.
Investing heavily in new product design as
well as enhancement, we urgently need more
specialist 'muscle'. We could write more here,
but we can better demortstrate the attractions
of our product and our company face to face.
