Seconds
Stuffed
O N A C O L D damp bleary-eyed
day IC Cricket Club set forth for
the first U A U fixture against
Southampton.
The Second XI having lost the
toss were sent in and made a slow
but solid start as Gareth Fish (27)
and Cieren Hassett (35) put on 66
for the 1st wicket in 26 overs.
Lunch was taken while it rained
at 77 for 2. After lunch Roger
Wilson (34) put bat to ball but
then disaster struck. IC lost 8
wickets for 10 runs in 7 overs as
they crashed to 118 all out.
Defeat stared IC in the face.
Thirty three overs later,
Southampton had duly won by
10 wickets . Much beer and heavy
fines followed. By the time you
read this Surrey will have
hopefully been thrashed on
Wednesday. Result: IC 2nd XI
were stuffed out of sight.
Ex-IC
girl
makes
good on
fiddle
W H E N IMPERIAL C O L L E G E
Symphony Orchestra takes to the
stage next Wednesday evening, the
players will be joined by an ex-IC
student who is currently making a
name for herself in the musical
world. Helen Cass came to
Imperial College four years ago to
study maths, but left after her first
year to pursue a career in music.
During that year she led the
College Orchestra.
On Wednesday Helen will be
performing Beethoven's Violin
Concerto, which is one of the
most popular works for the violin
and orchestra. The rest of the
programme also has a popular
slant—as might be expected for a
Summer gala concert. Proko-
fiev's 'Lieutenant Kije' suite is a
lively and amusing piece and
Walton's 'Crown Imperial' and
Elgar's 'Pomp and Circumstance
No 4' are both traditional Prom
favourites.
This should be a thoroughly
enjoyable evening and tickets are
only £1 at the door to students.
The concert is at 8.00pm on
Wednesday 8 May in the Great
Hall.
Sick as
parrots
T H E IC UNIVERSITY Chall-
enge team travelled to Manchester
on Tuesday, accompanied by 50
supporters, for the final against
Jesus College, Oxford.
Granada TV aren't too keen
on FELIX publishing the result.
Let's just say that team members
Tim Williams, Simon Errington,
Dick Langstaff and Duncan
Swan were sick as parrots.
What did you do this
weekend?
-and did you enjoy it?
London can be an exciting place to
live—but only if you know the ropes. In
October several hundred fresh faced first
years will arrive at Imperial College and you
can help them enjoy their first few weeks
here to the full.
A few weeks before the start of the academic year all first
year students receive a copy of the IC Union Handbook.
Can you pass on information to help them in their first
year? Whether y o u want to review a favourite
restaurant,pub or cinema.discuss the merits of the local
shops or write an article on study skills there is a place for
everything. If you are the Chairman/Captain of a club or
society you are also required to submit a short article
detailing your activities and facilities(see pidgeon holes
for details). General photographs of college and local
events are particularly useful.
If you are at all interested in passing on your knowledge
and advice please contact Nigel Atkinson via the Felix
office as soon as possible. The copy deadline will be
Friday 31st May.
