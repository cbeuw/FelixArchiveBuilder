Eddie and Pat
welcome you to
the HOOP and TOY
One of South Kensington's finest traditional
English Free House Pubs with excellent choice
of beers and home cooked fare at a
reasonable price.

mainframes. A large part of their
business comes from users of
very large micros of perhaps 400
Mbyte power. The Ford Cortinas
of the computing world.
C F M would not comment,
however, on which types needed
most repair.
It seemed to us that you just
can't write about computers
without talking to I B M . They
did, after all, invite us all to their
Exhibit a few month ago. A
salesman from another company
had this to say:
'IBM have been in it from the
start, and as far as most
customers see it, they will be here
for ever'.
We tried the number in the
London phone book at 12.45pm.
Would you believe—the staff
of I B M was out to lunch. At
2.10pm we tried again to find a
fast, helpful bunch of people. The
corporate mentality looms large,
however. It took three further
calls to trace someone who was
allowed to talk to us. Nothing
seems to frighten a business man
faster than questions about
about his marketing policies. Not
that IBM's policies are hard to
guess—they sell everything,
every way.
At the heavy end of the
spectrum—multi-million pound
systems—IBM have people
working with a client's data
preparation staff on a permanent
basis. O n this level of
sophistication, they can be fairly
confident of providing any
replacement or update because of
these very close links.
More recently, for smaller
systems, dealer networks have
been established. Different
networks deal with different
products. Agencies are awarded
for various sizes of computer.
Their spokesman's explanation
of the continuing growth of
computing was down to earth.
Someone in this company
understands economics.
'The main area of growth is
w i t h e x i s t i n g c u s t o m e r s
businesses growing. But market
saturation is not really a
problem, because the cost of
computing is Deflationary.
Computing power which, say,
ten years ago would have cost £ 1
now costs less than a penny.'
So demand grows as the price
falls. Simple, isn't it?
'We don't customise the
hardware. We tend to produce
general purpose machines that
are then customised through
programming. We run our own
training classes for the user's
staff, or at a smaller level we
provide Self-Tuition diskettes.'
For medium-sized firms,
training is often the province of
independent 'external education
companies.'
' W e have a range of
understanding among our users.
The direction in which we are
going is that the user need not
understand the programming or
the workings of the computer.
Switch on and just use a diskette.
How long do they last?
'There are machines around
that were installed 10 or 15 years
ago, but they are the exception.
Several years, anyway. But what
we find is that they are
technically obsolete long before
they...are obsolete, if you
like...mechanically.'
In other words, buggered after
ten years, but nobody minds. So
we seem to have some advice for
any budding computer salesmen.
G o for the first-time buyer, and
give lots of advice, training and
ass-licking. That way he will
come to you again after a very
short time to get updated. First
computer have a point. Allow a
realistic budget for training, and
make the software V E R Y easy to
use. Read F E L I X and make a
million—we could take on Fleet
Street yet. •
