S
ometimes, I like to discover
things, you know? Not all
kinds of things, not by any
stretch of the imagination.
There are literally thousands
of things that I don’t want to know any-
thing about, and they could fill several
television schedules. In fact, if you have
Channel Five and Hallmark, they do fill
them on most weekdays.
But some things I definitely want to
learnthingsabout.Whyeveryonehates
America, why I feel the need to insert
a bar joke into every issue of Felix, why
anyone thinks Statistics is something
I’d like to learn. These questions don’t
really have answers, no matter what my
Friday morning lecturer says, but some
other questions do. Sensible ones.
The thing with sensible questions is
that they usually have very, very long
answers, or answers that are wrapped
in a documentary presented by a boob
job on legs for Channel 5. I don’t want
to read a three-inch thick exposition of
feminism, but I also don’t want Kirsty
Gallacher jiggling around universities
in Slough asking seventeen year-olds
whether they feel oppressed or not.
So where’s the happy medium? En-
ter the Very Short Introduction series,
which you may well have come across
before. The Oxford University Press’
line of brief overviews cover an ever-
expanding range of topics, and claim to
do exactly what it says on the cover – be
short, be precise, and be informative.
Better still, they’re concise despite
being written by experts in the field,
and the high quality of editing means
that you get a nice flow to the proceed-
ings while sitting safe in the knowledge
that you’re being told the truth.
But can you judge a book just by its
title? At Felix, we wouldn’t dream of
doing such things. And so, to uphold
our three-week tradition of sky-high
journalism standards, we’ve employed
people we vaguely know to do our job
for us. Are the books accessible enough
if you’ve got no grounding in their sub-
ject whatsoever? And if you’re already
studying in the field, does the book
have anything to offer you at all?
Thanks to the Oxford University
Press, we’ve been able to test exactly
that, by taking some readers and offer-
ing them topics they’re both familiar
and unfamiliar with. James Warren,
our resident Physicist, goes toe-to-toe
with Flora Wilson of Mathematics and
myself; I moonlight as a Computer Sci-
entist when I’m not on Felix.
Did the books stand up to our three
demanding critics? Is reviewing a book
about journalism a strange fourth-wall
thing? Does anyone actually want to
hear my joke about the magician who
goes into an alley and turns into a bar?
Read on.
N
ewton is easily one of
the biggest names in
the history of scientific
method, one of the fa-
miliar faces of English
science that gets dragged out again and
again, and yet many of us know little
about him.
This introduction covers all of the
most popular aspects of the man, as
well as many that may usually be left
out; such as his unusual opinions on
religion and lesser-known occupations
such as Warden of the Mint.
As far as Biographies go, Newton
does a lot. There’s nothing that feels
unmentioned, and the tricky balance
between anecdotal ‘evidence’ and ac-
tual records is hit quite well.

The only problem lies in Rob Ili-
ffe’s style – a little to curt and a little
too professional, without the zest you
might have come to expect from the
series.
It’s still good, and functions reason-
ably well as a reference book, too, but
if you’re familiar with Newton’s work
already, his life may be of less interest
to you – particularly when presented
in such a dry manner.
O
ther than the apple
thing with the tree, I
don’t know an awful lot
about Newton, which
is a bit shameful given
his impact on... most things in the 17th
Century.
In fact, Newton surprised me in
many places with the extent of Sir
Isaac’s influence on things such as the
Royal Academy and his research that
furthered the field of Optics.
It also chronicles his brief but histor-
ically enduring battle with Leibniz over
the inception and application of calcu-
lus, and the illustrations in the book
offer great insight into the first outings
of some of modern science’s greatest
methods and theories, not least the ap-
ple thing with the tree.
There’s also a lot of richness in New-
ton’s life that keeps the book from be-
ing one long textbook – he held many
strong and lasting friendships with a
wide variety of people, and his life cov-
ered a lot of fields of interest. Even his
death, with which the book begins, is
an interesting tale.
The writing doesn’t always electrify,
but its content does, and as a whistle-
stop tour of Newton’s achievements,
this book really works.
B
eing a bit of a tricky sub-
ject to work around, even
for those that actually do it
for a living, Chaos is one of
the more abstract flavours
of Very Short Introduction, explaining
much of its material in its own terms
and analogies, meaning it may not sit
perfectly if you’ve studied the subject
before.
Nevertheless, Smith’s style is very
readable – he makes excellent con-
nections between theory and real-
ity, something vital for this topic, and
works hard to cover varied theories in
a very compact book.
It doesn’t go very deep, as one might
expect given the series title, but the
real let-down to those with some back-
ground in Chaos is the lack of any
mathematics whatsoever. The text is
lively enough to guarantee that you’ll
be shown something new, but fans of
meaty technical info should return to
their textbooks.
Even without an equation in sight,
Chaos is a worth addition to the book-
shelf. It’s well-edited, it knows how to
separate the interesting from the dull,
and it doesn’t miss out what’s vital.
P
erhaps ‘Pro’ is a bit of a
strong word, given I spend
most of my time thinking up
captions and fighting with
Macs in the Felix offices
rather than uncovering the truth and
pushing up literaryt standards across
the board. Nevertheless, Journalism is
definitely an interesting title for me.
Unlike the ‘applied’ VSI books, Jour-
nalism is more of a tour-de-force of
Journalistic concepts, trends in history,
and the great and noble art of writing
about things that are happening.
Even though it reads itself like a tab-
loid at times, Journalism is written in
an engaging way and throws a lot of
questions at the reader at the same
time as showing some lesser-known
stories behind the big media events of
the last century or so.
For anyone considering writing in
their future, Journalism gives a lot of
food for thought. Whether it’s an intel-
lectual discourse is debateable, but it
tries its utmost to cover the ethics both
of yesteryear and the next generation
of writers, and generally does it with a
lot of sensitivity, describing finally the
next age of journalism.
T
he idea of mathematical
modelling fills me with
enough dread on its own;
the news that most mod-
els are actually inherently
“unpredictable” in some sense of the
word, was obviously a bit of a kicker
for me.
Thankfully, Chaos is devoid from
much numeral-based confusion, save a
few wibbly graphs and some fairly pe-
culiar poetry choices.
Smith fits the bill of a VSI author per-
fectly – sharp, observant and down-
to-earth, his examples and wordings
highlight difficult-to-grasp areas and
quickly break them down, introducing
the concept of Chaos – a phenomena
affecting systems such as Climate and
myriad others – gradually.
Weather forecasting is either very
important or very obvious in the realm
of Chaos, because Smith relates most
of his examples to it, and even though I
was in the mood for a little variation by
Chapter 10, the subject as a whole re-
mains gripping – the force affects the
world to a mystifying degree, which
Chaos only scratches.
Easy to grasp and genuinely impor-
tant for any applied scientist, Chaos is
definitely worth picking up.
M
ost of us read a news-
paper in some form
or another – whether
it’s a London Lite
you’ve had thrown at
you by a vendor, or a Financial Times
you’ve picked up so that people think
you’re clever.
Journalism does its best to get un-
der the bonnet of modern journalism,
charting its progress up to the mod-
ern day and offering some insight into
where it may be headed. It’s a good
compilation of statistics, excerpts, sto-
ries and serious opinion, put together
and tied up in a subject that’s none too
boring.
For some reason, it doesn’t really
click with me. It may be that you need
a more journalistic base to really ‘get’
Journalism; it may just be that Har-
greaves’ writing style – which has all
the characteristics of a lifelong jour-
nalist – doesn’t appeal. Whatever it is,
I found the book flagging a little after a
few chapters.
Still, if you’ve got your heart set on
learning more about a key occupation
of the next century, you could do a lot
worse than read this. It’s concise and
generally unbiased – which makes it
good journalism in itself.
