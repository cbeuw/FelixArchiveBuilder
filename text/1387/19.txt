As I have mentioned in previous weeks
Imperial College Union is supporting
the proposed changes to the NUS
Constitution so that the organisation
can organise itself in a manner that is
relevant to coherent, more representative
policy making and sound financial
management. In order for these changes
to pass this academic year almost 40
Unions, including ours, have voted to
request an Extraordinary Conference
which is to be held on Tuesday 4
December in Leicester.
At this point I would like to appeal to
all of those students who voted for us
to affiliate last year. As a result of your
decision the Union is now committed
to paying NUS £44,000 per annum in
affiliation fees. In my view there is little
point in us paying this money if we
are not going to have the opportunity
to voice our opinion. This is why it is
vital that we send a full delegation of
9 people along to this conference so
that the Union is obtaining maximum
value for money out of this ridiculous,
clunking, socialist vehicle that we are
now working very hard to try and change
by supporting the Governance Review.
Travel and reasonable food expenses
will be provided by the Union. The
Extraordinary Conference is a one day
event. Our delegation will leave (not
too) early in the
morning and you
will be back in
London by early
evening. If you
have an interest in
exactly how silly
some of the more
“revolutionary”
groupings
currently active
within NUS are
then please drop
me an email and I will add you to our
delegation. National student politics has
always been a pantomime and if you
are interested in a day of what will be
some very heated debates regarding the
Governance Review please let me know
by Wednesday lunchtime at the very
latest. You never know, you could end up
speaking at this event.
Moderate Unions will duly engage in an
entire day of Trot bashing as the hard
left are insisting that this process is part
of some secret right-wing conspiracy
to hijack student democracy so I urge
you to come along so that we are in the
best position from which to articulate
the Union’s point of view. I appreciate
that the prospect of a free trip to the
Midlands is not the best offer you will
receive during your time at Imperial but it
should be an entertaining day.

How did you do in your last set of exams?
Has anyone given you a breakdown of how
you managed in each individual section?
Presuming you didn’t get 100% has anyone
told you where you went wrong? What
about that piece of coursework you spent
six hard weeks slogging on?
Despite all the fun that is inevitably had at
University, there are very few among us
who don’t get that tingle of apprehension
around exam time which finally makes you
knuckle down and work. So after all that
frantic revision, endless nights of trying to
understand Fourier Analysis, the occasional
sneaky Gin and Tonic (because it helps you
think more clearly) and incomprehensibly
scribbled chemical equations, sometimes
you just can’t work out what went wrong
on the day or how you could do better next
time.
Do you feel like the feedback you get after
you have been assessed is enough to help
you improve in the future? As with much
of the content of your exams at Imperial
you are probably not going to be able to
forget everything you’ve learnt immediately
after your exams are over. Everything
is beginning to tie in and the next major
element of your course will rely heavily on
what you have (or haven’t) already learnt.
Students at Imperial
have never been
particularly satisfied
with the feedback
they receive on
assessed work. Not
knowing where you
went wrong can be
very frustrating and
future development
can be hampered
by elements of
the course you
haven’t completely
understood. This
has become abundantly clear through
Student Surveys such as SOLE and the
NSS where assessment feedback receives
a notoriously low score. It is about time
something was done about it and we want
to know what you think.
Come along to SAF LT G34 on Thursday
22nd November at 12:00pm for free
nibbles and tell us about how you think
exam feedback would help you. Is there
something that works, what really doesn’t
and what more could be done to ensure
you get the best learning experience from
the assessment process at Imperial? It’s
your degree so make sure you get the most
out of it!
