Virgo
This week you look
through a guide to
Vietnam. Vietnam
sounds like a lovely
place to go to.
However, you’re
mummy wants to go to Malaysia, or Borneo at
least. You’re not against this idea but Vietnam
sounds particularly beautiful. At the weekend
you’ll try and decide where you’re going to go
otherwise you’ll stab your mum in the groin
with a fish knife.
Scorpio
So... Super Mario
Galaxy is out today.
What the hell are
you doing reading
this horoscope?
Unless you skipped
straight here, you’ve probably read a large
proportion of this paper too, meaning you’ve
wasted even more time not buying the greatest
game ever since Mario 64. Well, quite possibly.
I can feel it in my water. Or something. Is that
pregnant women who do that?
Libra
Ten down, two to
go. I think this calls
for a montage before
the final act of
committing literary
nonsense to paper.
Er... montage... that might be tough to do
with words. How about a collage? That’s near
enough: xopoxxxxoxopxxxxoxxpooooxxoxoxo
xoxpppppxoxxoooooxxxxppxxooxoxooooxoxo
Sagittarius
The rumour mill is
really turning this
week bird watchers.
In the red corner we
have Albino Andrew
and in the blue
corner we have Mike Cook. The showdown
is pencilled in to begin next Wednesday. Be
there or be square, like the shape of a boxing
ring. There’s going to be blood, juice, tears and
most definitely little babies whirling round in
blenders. Ok... bye then.
Capricorn
So, I’ve resisted
this far but it’s
time to unleash the
“What does this
symbol resemble?”
horoscope. Quite
clearly its a man diving into a swimming pool.
Rotating it 90 degrees anti-clockwise makes
it look like someone driving a car with no
steering wheel! Hehe! SNARF SNARF!
Cancer
This week you step
off your bicycle
slightly too quickly
and your shin shat-
ters beneath you.
How unfortunate.
Seizing an ideal opportunity, a bicycle thief
who happens to be walking by attempts to
steal your bike. You spear him with the re-
mains of your splintered leg.
Gemini
Personally I feel
the intake of new
equity is going to
drastically reduce
our creditor N-CAP
rating thus reducing
the annual governance. It is tantamount to
paramount that this situation is avoided if we
are to avert a crisis of consultant analystical
proportions whilst maintaining a rise in hedge
funds that increase capacity flow by two
hundred and eighty three hundred percent.
Leo
Showers exist in the
Union! Hurrah! Of
course, I’m not go-
ing to tell you where
they are otherwise
you might come
and interfere with my downstairs mix up at 5
o’clock in the morning. Sorry about that. Like-
wise, I’m not going to tell you about the secret
doorway I found in the Blackett building this
week, either. The Holy Grail is somewhere in
Greenland though – you can have that one.
Taurus
This week you’re let
loose on the news
pages. Somehow
you manage to come
up with a story
yourself and flesh
out another one culminating in around 2000
BC Wordsworth. I once lived BC. It was a dull
time you know. Most people had beards and
Shockwaves hadn’t invented their Ultra Hold
formula yet so people wandered around with
such lifeless hair. Tsk.
Aries
During the night
your bedroom
begins to shrink.
Oddly enough it’s
not painful when
you wake up the
next day enclosed in a small box. Luckily your
head managed to poke out through the door
and your feet through the window. Going to
the salle du bains though... bad luck I’m afraid.
Pisces
My favourite kind of
Turkish rug is one
of those ones which
has a rectangle
going all the way
around it. They’re
brilliant for playing pretend football on with
your Boglins. Making sound effects too really
heightens the action. “Puttt... putttt... GOAL!”
One time, the fire place crackled and a spark
leapt out and struck my temple. Now look at
me. I’m a mess.

Aquarius
You decide to climb
through the hole in
your office ceiling
where there’s a tile
panel missing. Fol-
lowing the piping
leads to a cave. You’re just able to squeeze into
the dank space where you’re greeted by six
very surprised little monkeys. Thanks to your
lunchtime Russian lessons you’re able com-
municate easily with them, even managing to
ask for sugar with your Coca Cola.
