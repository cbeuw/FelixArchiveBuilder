t’s quite some time since the
gaming behemoth named Halo
3 graced our 360s and ate up
time that would otherwise be
spent wasted.
It’s a testament to the prodigious skill
of Bungie that two months have done
little to wane the fervour. And why
not? Halo 2 kept gamers enthralled for
a few years after its release and it’s a
given that the third son will carry on
the proud tradition, perhaps with the
banner held higher.
I’ve only been playing the multi-
player for a couple of weeks now but
I concur with Robin Andrews about
the experience. It’s simply delicious
despite Live being largely populated
by whining prepubescent little snots.
Then there are the Pop Idol wannabes;
to put it simply they should be drug
out into the street and shot. Many,
many times. It’s a godsend that Halo 3
offers the all-important mute function:
simply choose the boisterous buffoon
from the scoreboard and then hit X to
mute him forever. So what if he’s for-
mulating the winning strategy or if he
needs backup... even in defeat you can
be happy.
However, bar these myriad offenders,
sometimes magic just happens. Mov-
ing tightly as a group of four, you rush
the enemy head-on. You know they’re
blatantly going to grenade you as they
scramble against your assault. How-
ever they realise something important:
the team count is usually five. As two
fall dead where they stand and a telltale
report rings throughout the causeway,
the objective of your rush becomes
apparent. The stragglers make a mad
dash to safety as they’re gunned down.
The exciting thing is, you can be on the
receiving end just as easily.
Now with the Halo fever it’s often
easy to forget that there are actually
other games out there. This past week
saw the release of games like Assassin’s
Creed and Call of Duty 4; both seem to
be very enticing games so expect some
feature articles at a Felix near you. Old
school adventuring gets a kick up it’s
morbidly decaying backside with the
release of Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune.
I’m quite a fan of Naughty Dog - with
the Jak trilogy constituting some of my
all-time favourite games. However, as
many of you are aware... all this will
pale in comparison to what will be
happening today.
Yes, the 16th of November marks
the day that a proper Mario game be-
comes unleashed on a hapless popula-
tion. Children will scream. Parents will
tear their hair out. And the sound of a
thousand Wiimotes crying out in joy
will ring throughout the globe. Or you
know, lots of people will buy it and play
happily, yay.
Now while I’m really interested in
getting Super Mario Galaxy, I’m sort of
torn between a Wii and an Xbox 360.
My birthday just whizzed by a day ago
and I’m still pondering which one to
get... Mario or Masterchief.
Bah. One PS3 and a copy of Metal
Gear Solid 4 and I’ll be content. It’s too
bad that that’s ages away...

Week

BOOM, headshot! Say what about insecurity?

I’m part of an ongoing war. A highly-
charged, horrifically violent conflict
that has left many people scarred for
life. Some of us have risen through the
ranks to stand above the metaphorical
base layer below, watching as human-
ity fights itself in a spiral of destruction
– silently observing man’s inhumanity
to man.
And, like any global conflict, this one
is always highly political.
‘Red team rules. Blue team is going
down!’ blares one, his virtual finger
pointing aggressively across the map.
His comrades in arms line up against
the grey, Forerunner structure, already
planning which weapon or vehicle they
are going to pinch first. Suddenly, a
transmission is received from the other
side of the grassy, hilly landscape.
‘Red team can suck it,’ a disembodied
voice replies. The red team shout mul-
tiple expletives back, most of them with
strong American accents. Yet someone
remains quiet – the Commander, who
grabs his sniper rifle and walks calmly
down the left ramp. ‘Would everyone
just be quiet and get on with it?’ He
is heard sighing, before he continues
his journey out into the wilderness of
Valhalla. Some of his allies are clearly
surprised by his distinctly different
accent.
‘Hey guys, he’s British!’ exclaims one.
Another reads out his gamertag – sev-
eral times, in fact – before falling silent
again. Someone from the opposing side
points out that this particular gamer
should go back to England and drink
some more tea, to which he calmly ex-
plains he is already living there. And
that tea isn’t really his thing. After this
highly intellectual political debate,
which included reasons why certain
people should ‘turn down the retar-
dation’, a few vehicles begin to move,
several bullets are fired, and soon
enough the war of stupidity breaks out
into a war of bul-
lets, explosions,
and warthogs.
Welcome to the
world of Halo 3’s
multiplayer.
Halo 2’s multi-
player was by all
accounts a huge
success, one which
has strongly influ-
enced many other
games in its genre.
Its fan base was
enormous, and
all were looking
forward to Halo
3, nervously won-
dering whether or
not its multiplayer
would exceed the
highest of their ex-
pectations. I was
one of them. After
completing the
campaign mode
several times over – seriously people,
it really is that stunning – I leapt into
the multiplayer.
To be honest with you – and to show
off a bit – I was pretty good at Halo 2.
I was a dedicated online gamer then,
and I am even more so today. After fin-
ishing the fight with the Master Chief,
I took my online avatar – Shadowb-
lade9876 (yes, that was originally from
an MMORPG and no there aren’t 9,876
of us) – once again to the forefront of
the world’s largest online conflict.
The game starts you off with an ob-
ligatory training session, to make sure
you know how to aim a gun at some-
one who is trying to do precisely the
same thing. It was hilarious – everyone
else could barely reload before getting
mêléed in the back of the head. Anoth-
er hapless soul picked up a beam rifle
– the Covenant version of the sniper
rifle – and attempted to use it to em-
barrassing effect. Being a sniper my-
self, I felt his ig-
norance with a
scoped weapon
had to be pun-
ished. A Ghost,
a small Cov-
enant vehicle,
ploughed into
him soon after-
wards. The game
kindly reminded
me I was award-
ed the “Splatter”
medal just as his
listless body im-
pacted the snow,
causing a small
plume to form.
After the
match ended, the
game decided to
promote me to
an Apprentice,
the lowest rank
possible in the
game. A new ad-
dition to the multiplayer, people can
now advance in virtual military rank
by gaining experience points for do-
ing particularly well in certain engage-
ments. Not only this, but you are also
given Skill Points in Ranked Matches,
which shows people your relative skill
level in relation to everyone else play-
ing. If you succeed in raising both of
these stats, you can ascend through
the ranks.
This little addition happened to make
Halo 3 more addictive than initially
thought. Upon entering my first Social
Slayer match – basically a team death-
match – I was laughed at by a Lieuten-
ant, someone who had been playing
the multiplayer much more than I had
by that point. He kindly informed me
that I was a n00b, and stood very lit-
tle chance of winning. Of course this
was not actually what he said – most
of it was far too vulgar to print in this
high-brow publication. Nevertheless, I

War is hell... and utterly brown as the next generation of consoles will have you believe. Reality is over-rated, isn’t it?
