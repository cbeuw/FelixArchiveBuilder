Imperial Team of the Week
This week, Sports Partnership along
with Felix Sport have chosen the Ten-
nis Men’s 2nd team as their ‘Team of
the Week’.
The team has had a great start to
the season- comfortably beating all
their opponents so far, which has
seen them rise to joint first in the Fe-
lix Sports League.
The winning streak continued this
week with a great win against Chich-
ester Men’s 1st, and it will hopefully
continue for weeks to come.
Great result guys.

Being a part of the Imperial team
that got promoted to the Premier
League last year was absolutely bril-
liant. We were undefeated in the SE
Conference and lost out narrowly to
Cambridge in the Cup competition.
This year we have ambitions to make
a mark in our new league and ensure
that we remain there for next year.
To round off a successful season, we
joined forces with the men’s team to
take on universities in Europe in the
IDEA league and were the winners
of the tournament.

News in brief
Tennis Men’s 2nd
Best loss ever for Men’s 1st!
I’d like to start by saying that this was
probably the most satisfactory defeat
we’ll have, if such a thing exists. Don’t
get me wrong, we’re disappointed to
have lost but sometimes you just have
to admit that the other team was better
(or half of their team was better, in this
case). UCL, a team who we narrowly
lost to, were ‘spanked’ 15-2 by London
Met in the opening week, so we knew
we were going to have a tough night.
Daniel Andersson was drafted in to an
already strong Imperial team consist-
ing of Wei Lun, Kevin and Gaetan. Our
opponents boasted a Number 1 and
2 pairing of Zhi Tao Jiang and Hong
Ming Zhang. The former plays for the
top team in the British Premier League,
and according to the IC players who
played, the latter is better than him. So
yeah, they’re good.
Incidentally I was umpiring some of
the Girls’ matches against Middlesex
at the time, which is something you
naturally look forward to. Indeed, I no-
ticed fellow IC Table Tennis member/
spectator, Jerry, rush over at the first
opportunity to umpire Anusha’s match
with Egle Adomelyte of Middlesex…
even though they were already 3 sets
in. But I found myself getting more dis-
tracted by the play from London Met’s
Chinese duo on the other tables – and
that’s saying a lot. They came, played 9
games between them (including a dou-
bles) without dropping a set, and left.
They’re completely out of our league
(we’ll leave England’s top players to
handle them in the future, although

even they would probably struggle) and
they single-handedly won the game for
their team.
However, when they were gone, the
“competitive” match got going. Gaetan
won Imperial’s first sets of the day (!)
but it was not enough, as he lost an ab-
sorbing encounter with Sampson Reid,
going down 11-8 in the final set. Wei
Lun also lost out to Sampson (3-1), but
at one stage looked to be taking the
game into a decider, only to fall 11-9
in the 4th. Kevin had fewer problems
with him though, to record a 3-1 vic-
tory. Mert Kirteler proved a much
easier assignment for the IC players
as all beat him comfortably in straight
sets. The last match of the night was
between Daniel and Sampson. Daniel
got off to a flying start taking the first
two sets with much ease but possibly
due to a lack of concentration, was
pegged back to 2-2. It is important to
regain your composure in these situa-
tions, especially when your opponent
is growing in confidence and picking
up a head of steam. In fact, I think
Sampson was even growling between
winning points! Yes, that’s right, mak-
ing audible growling sounds, much to
the amusement (and bemusement) of
those watching. He seems very tame
off the court, though, I can assure you.
Daniel took little notice of this and
went back to the kind of play that gave
him the lead, dominating rallies close
to the table and again taking the set
comfortably to win 3-2.
It was a nice end to a difficult match.
It would have been easy to get dis-
heartened when staring down a 9-0
deficit with the match already lost, but
we showed great determination to take
6 of the next 8 rubbers. As long as they
keep the same team, no one will get
close to London Met this season, and
few will manage to take 6 games off
them. We can take many positives out
of this match and look forward to what
will hopefully be a successful season!

The MCC have set Imperial College
scientists the task of making new
cricket balls pink over the coming
winter. The reasoning behind this
is that pink is better to spot than
the traditional red ball during day
matches, as well as easier to see than
the white balls for night games. It
is suggested that the pink balls will
give the batsman an extra fraction
of a second to spot the ball, however
bowlers will probably be thinking
that this takes the edge away from
their bowling.
Apparently, the challenge with the
New pink cricket balls
cricket balls is for them to retain
their colour after being whacked sev-
eral times. It is this that the scientists
will be working on, more specifically
figuring out a way to impregnate the
ball with the colour and then stop-
ping the grass discolouring it.
To begin with, the ball will be used
at university level and second XI
matches at the start of next season.
The eventual aim is for the balls to
be used in Twenty-20 matches and
then one-day internationals.
Previously, orange balls were con-
sidered but they were hard to see on
television. Hopefully the pink one
will be better for both the teams and
the television.

Miner socs go paintballing
In it’s second year, the annual paint-
balling competition between Materi-
als and Geology is quickly becoming a
tradition. Four geologists and a token
physicist joined 25 material scientists
at 7.30am in the union. A disappoint-
ing turn out amongst Geology was
mainly driven by a mass field trip the
following weekend. This prompted
Steph, the De La Beche President, to
proclaim that they would have lost the
match anyway.
With the teams being pre-decided by
Post, who listed everyone he wanted to
shoot in one column and everyone he
didn’t mind hitting in crossfire in the
other column, we boarded our coach to
Croydon. Upon arrival we donned our
camo gear, face masks and helmets and
proceeded to wage war. In one corner,
the white team crowded behind green
meshing, in the other the blue team
hauled up on the ramparts of a wood-
en castle. Blows were exchanged; I was
shot in the face. A subsequent sound
on the whistle stopped the game show-
ing a triumphant white player, flag in
hand. Defend and then attack- our
turn. I quickly realised how little accu-
racy paintball guns have. It’s a matter-
of-the-numbers game – get close and
hope one shot finds its target. Having
been shot out before time again, our
team knew we were up against an ex-
perienced foe, especially Kevin who
deemed himself good enough to paint-
ball in a T-shirt.
The next round was speedball, a
small, manic area – where we again
got trashed. The third stage inventively
called barrels, allowed some more tac-
tical play by the blues, who eventu-
ally got some FIT points! That’s Flag-
In-Transit, not Fitty-In-Team as one
might expect.
Lunch was provided by Pizza Hut
who, it seems, make the best margh-
erita pizzas ever. The hungry students
quickly finished off 15 or so in order to
make it out for the last two stages of
the day, village and bunker. The white
team performed well in the village and
managed to increase their point mar-
gin. Good use of smoke grenades in
the bunker stage gave sufficient cover
for both teams to grab the flag in their
attempts.
A grand-prix-esque celebration fea-
turing a magnum of champagne was
thrown for the winning team. This
confused pseudo-fresher Borja, think-
ing that the alcohol was for consum-
ing, he tried to neck it before being
reminded that it was for spraying. The
best bruise went to Chumley but on
later inspection, probably should have
been awarded to Hanyan for the huge
one on her arm. An awesome trip,
thanks to everyone for coming.
Overall a win for Materials! Better
luck next time Geology!
Splat! (I couldn’t fill the whole page so I had to use a random picture!)
