Is Imperial really better than MIT?
Tom Jones investigates the methodology behind the THES rankings which places Imperial 5th
in the world
ahead of academic giants like Princeton and MIT and asks whether Imperial actually deserves its position

with Imperial vaulting to
an enviable fifth place, placing it in
the league of Oxbridge and Yale while
beating the likes of such esteemed in-
stitutions as Princeton and MIT. While
the exceptional performance was a
renewed source of pride for Imperial,
doubts have been cast by students as
well as faculty across the board on the
accuracy of the league table produced,
with obvious misalignments such as
the University of Hong Kong being
rated higher than Stanford University
and University College London placed
thirteen spots above research giant
University of California at Berkeley.
The THES ranking, started since
2004 by education and careers compa-
ny Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), ranks
universities in the globe by criteria
such as the opinions of academics and
employers, citation count of its faculty,
the make up of international students
and staff as well as the ratio of staff to
students, which is used as a rough met-
ric to measure the quality of teaching
in universities. This year witnessed a
major reshuffling in THES due to the
implementation of Z-scores – meas-
uring the amount of deviation from
the average instead of using absolute
scores as were for previous years – and
this had the effect of preventing sin-
gular exceptionally good performers
from depressing scores of all other in-
stitutions in that measure, such as LSE
for “international students”.
A huge distinguishing factor of THES
from another frequently cited ranking,
the Academic Ranking of World Uni-
versity produced by the Shanghai Jiao-
tong University in China, is the number
of non-American schools making to
the top echelons of the table. While the
Shanghai Jiaotong, which was cited by
Economist, focuses on solid indicators
such as citation count and Nobel priz-
es, the peer-review system remained
central to the methodology of THES.
Of questionable validity is the way
“peer review” was conducted. Of the
190,000 academics that were emailed
a request to complete their online sur-
vey last year, only 1,600 responded,
which represented a response rate of
an astonishingly low 0.8%.
To add to the woes for peer review, a
detailed inspection of the overall rank-
ing saw 7th ranked Caltech and 19th
ranked Stanford University as the only
two universities in the table of top 200
to be assigned a perfect citation per
faculty score of 100, while Imperial,
which came in 5th, scored an unenvi-
able 81.
Similarly, the tables for individual
disciplines, such as Natural Sciences,
Biomedicine, Technology, Social Sci-
ence and Arts and Humanities, also
saw huge discrepancies between peer
review scores and citation count. In
general, American universities are
graded far more harshly by peer-
reviewers than their citations might
suggest. For example, in the table for
Biomedicine, while the National Uni-
versity of Singapore is placed at the
12th spot above California Institute
of Technology at 23rd place, its cita-
tion count is a mere 4.4, a far-cry from
Caltech’s 10.4, which incidentally, is
only second to MIT’s 11.3 (9th place).
Such glaring gulf between peer review
scores and the actual citation measured
cast huge doubt to the validity of the
whole peer review system, which is the
backbone of THES. One cannot help
thinking why international academics
would like to cite American research-
ers so profusely while at the same time
refuse to vote for them with zeal.
The standard of checking data and
information is also dubious. Last year,
CNNMoney/Fortune published a top
MBA ranking by QS, only to withdraw
it hastily and embarrassingly after rev-
elations that the ranking did not dis-
tinguish between North Carolina State
University and the more esteemed
Kenan-Flagler Business School of the
University of North Carolina. In addi-
tion, until recently, the THES famously
misspelled University of Peking as
University of Beijing for three years in
a row.
Amongst other controversial meas-
ures used by THES is how the percent-
age of international students in a uni-
versity has to do with its actual quality.
While the THES believes that the abil-
ity to attract foreign students reflects
a university’s quality, it is known that
some uncompetitive universities in
Australia, for example, have an open
door admission policy to foreign stu-
dents which accept basically school-
dropouts and come packaged with a
foundation course in addition to the
degree programme. In such case, for-
eign students are only viewed as cash
cows, not a hallmark of academic ex-
cellence. In addition, elite private uni-
versities in the United States are known
to cap their international admission to
roughly 7% and public ones at 2%. The
criteria of measuring the presence of
international students look biased if
these policies are implemented.
Supporters of THES are likely to
highlight that weighing universities
merely by means of citation and No-
bel Prizes alone are likely to be inac-
curate. For one, there is the likelihood
of American researchers citing each
other, and with the number of US uni-
versities, the American schools are
likely to enjoy an unfair advantage
over their competitors. However, well
endowed schools are likely to attract
the best academics and fund meaning-
ful research, and with American giants
like Princeton owning an endowment

fund at an excess of 100 times that
of Durham, it is not at all surprising
that the top institutions in the United
States remain a league of their own by
citation count.
There is also a worry that it may be
a shameless effort by the THES to gain
audience share by appealing to inter-
national institutions. Oxbridge and
London colleges have been edging up
the table year on year in THES. While
there may be real improvement in ac-
tual quality, moving up nine places
(Imperial) in the window of 3 years is
highly dubious and represents more
of a change in ranking methodologies
than anything else. In the employer
review section, the University of Man-
chester is ranked higher by employers
than Stanford, Princeton and MIT,
which leads to the obvious suggestion
of a steep British bias. Although the
THES enjoyed extensive reporting by
British as well as newspapers in Com-
monwealth countries like Singapore,
Malaysia and India, it was hardly
noticed by newspapers across the
Atlantic.
While the efforts taken to compile a
true and fair table for students should
be applauded, it is unlikely that the
essence of any university can be en-
capsulated merely by statistics on a ta-
ble. Nevertheless, we can only expect
league tables to continue to be part of
the educational reality.
