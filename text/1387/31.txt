Middlesex Men’s 1st 7
Imperial Men’s 1st 25
One minute and twenty seconds, that’s
how long it took Imperial’s 1st XV to
score against bottom of the league
Middlesex. Second row Tom Zeal
charged down a kick from the Middle-
sex fly-half and then managed to scoop
the ball up and score the opening try.
It seemed that this was going to be an
easy day, and this thought was definite-
ly embedded in everyone’s mind when
the ball was gracefully passed along the
line to the other second row Bo Saseg-
bon who scored the second try 5 min-
utes later.
It was at this point that the side be-
gan to get complacent, especially in the
forwards. Players were waiting in the
attacking line, ready for their chance
of glory and to seal a dramatic victory.
However this was not going to be as
Middlesex realised what Imperial were
us to and decided to show them what
they could do. And this was achieved
with a converted try right before the
end of the first half.
Imperial had something to prove,
they were not showing signs of a team
who were top of the table, and after
some stern words from the coach, cap-
tain and vice-captain, Imperial had to
get out of their complacent groove.
Changes were made with flanker Nick
Johnstone being brought on, only to
do a massive tackle, then throw up and
have to be taken off after only 5 min-
utes, hence earning himself the title of
Twat of the Match.
But the side was slowly beginning to
get back into their style of play, with
prop Terry Addo (the other Twat of
the Match) putting in some big Ameri-
can football style hits. Centre James
Fletcher, showing his strength and skill,
managed to put a huge hit on the Mid-
dlesex winger from a high ball, only for
the referee to give a penalty for a ‘high’
tackle. Tom Carroll seemed to be the
only consistent player on the pitch, al-
ways running with intensity and tack-
ling with aggression, thus rightly earn-
ing himself the Man of the Match title.
Eventually Imperial got back to the
level they had at the start of the game
and flanker James Pettit scored the fi-
nal try to leave the score at 25 – 7 at the
full time whistle.
Nathan and his kamikaze style of fencing
Imperial Men’s 2nd Fencing team ex-
tended their unbeaten start to the sea-
son to three matches by demolishing
an under-strength Royal Holloway 1st
side.
Things immediately looked promis-
ing when Royal Holloway arrived with
only three fencers. As has become tra-
dition this season, sabre was fenced
first, with Luka Lukic given the all im-
portant anchor position after his stun-
ning performance last week. He didn’t
disappoint, romping to a 5 – 2 victory
over his first opponent and setting the
tone for the rest of the match. Team
captain Maurice Berk struggled against
the opposing captain in his first con-
test, going down to a 5 – 6 defeat but
still leaving Imperial in the lead. Will
Hoy found himself on the right side of
another close score-line, winning his
first match 5 – 4. Maurice continued to
struggle, surrendering Imperial’s lead
as he suffered a heavy 4 – 8 defeat at
the hands of his second opponent, but
Luka quickly recovered it with a 6 – 0
victory. Will had a second close match,
again winning 5 – 4 before Maurice
redeemed himself with a 5 – 1 victory
over his final opponent. With Will and
Luka winning their final matches 5 – 2
and 5 – 0 respectively, sabre finished
with Imperial enjoying a commanding
lead at 45 – 27.
Foil was up next and Nathan Blundell
got things off to a great start with a 5 –
0 victory in his first match. New man
Alex Bishop, in for the absent Ez Has-
san, continued Imperial’s winning ways
by brushing aside his opponent 5 – 3.
Noris Lo made it three from three with
another excellent 5 – 2 win. The rest
of the weapon continued in this vein,
with the second round of matches be-
ing won 5 – 0, 5 – 1 and 5 – 2 by Alex,

Nathan and Norris respectively. Royal
Holloway were simply outclassed as
Alex won his final match 5 – 2, Norris
romped to a 5 – 0 victory and Nathan
saw off his opponent 5 – 2. With the
scores at 90 – 41 before going into
épeé, Imperial had already won, with
pride the only thing left to play for.
Luka kicked épeé off with another
assured 5 – 4 victory against his first
opponent. Maurice struggled to a 2 – 5
defeat while Alex won his first match
7 – 5, leaving Imperial a point behind
in that weapon. Maurice did better
against his second opponent, win-
ning 6 – 4, while Luka won his second
match 5 – 2 and Alex drew his 5 – 5.
Maurice then elected to sub himself off
for Nathan who was keen to give épeé
a go. He proved to be a roaring success,
quickly developing a unique kamikaze
style of fencing whereby he dramati-
cally launched himself at his opponent
with deadly accuracy. His opponent,
faced with such a vicious onslaught,
slumped to a 5 – 1 defeat. Similarly,
Alex and Luka both won their final
matches 5 – 1 to wrap up yet another
Imperial victory. ‘Man of the Match’
goes to Alex for his excellent debut.
Imperial travel to rock-bottom Port-
smouth next week, as they aim to take
another giant step towards winning
the league.
