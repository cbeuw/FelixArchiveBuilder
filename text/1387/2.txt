Countdown to the Lord Mayor’s Show 2007
More dramatics than a shuttle take off at Cape Canaveral as the CGCU prepares for the annual LMS parade
A group of students working at mid-
night on a Friday night is nothing new,
especially for Imperial. A group of stu-
dents working outside in the freezing
cold painting and cutting wood can
only mean one thing, its time for the
Lord Mayor’s Show (LMS).
The City and Guilds College Union
was honoured to represent Imperial in
the annual parade to celebrate the Lord
Mayor of the City of London. This year,
as is generally the case, the story of the
CGCU float began less then a week be-
fore the show with a “design” that was
scrawled on the back of a set of lecture
notes. Here is the story:
T-minus 119 hours: (to the start
of the parade)
The “Acting” LMS Coordinator sud-
denly realised how little he has been
acting and with five days to go starts
frantically calling lorry companies to
get one arranged. The hours tick by
and an angel in the form of Gunns
Transport appears.
T-minus 115 hours:
After rejoicing in the success of get-
ting a lorry the CGCU office is thrown
into disarray by a very distressed phone
call from the LMS office. Apparently
they had not received payment and
were considering pulling the CGCU
float from the parade. A quick check
of the accounts showed the money
from the BP sponsorship hadn’t come
through yet. A call to BP solved this
and a cheque was written and posted
(thank god for the phrase “The cheque
is in the post”).
T-minus 95 hours:
Armed with the knowledge that hav-
ing a lorry is no good if you have noth-
ing to put on it and the fact that there is
a distinct lack of building suppliers in
the South Kensington area we quickly
arranged for a delivery of the estimated
amount, aka a complete guess, of wood
and nails. An attempt was made at im-
proving the design but it was scrapped
as it looked worse than the initial con-
cept drawing.
T-minus 71 hours:
A very “helpful” delivery man, who
asked no questions, dumped our sup-
plies in college so construction could
commence. We must congratulate Im-
perial students for their principles in
that nothing was stolen from the pile
that lay at the side of the road for two
days.
T-minus 66 hours:
Construction began, still with no of-
ficial design. First blood was drawn.
After abandoning any hope of proper
construction, chicken wire became our
medium of choice. A whopping 22.5m
of mesh tubing was born.
T-minus 44 hours:
The faculty car park was besieged.
Having the “best” location in college
for construction, despite it being only
Edward Judge
CGCU Honorary Secretary
The CGCU float (left) and CGCU motorised mascot Bo’ (right) being towed by a massive truck
half as high as the float, we set about
real construction. This was halted
quickly once the lack of tools became
apparent.
T-minus 43 hours:
The CGCU offices were raided and
four “saws” were obtained. However,
the first three good ones we tried
proved incapable of cutting wood. The
oldest saw in the world was our only
hope. Covered in rust, the name War-
rior was bestowed upon it.
T-minus 40 hours:
We were tired. Construction ceased.
T-minus 21 hours:
The actual amount of work remain-
ing dawned upon us. Panic ensued. A
trip to Argos solved further supply is-
sues and the construction resumed.
T-minus 17 hours:
The teams were spilt and while one
painted, the other attended a security
briefing that was “to die for”. After be-
ing told there was a serious risk of ter-
rorism during the day the commanding
officer changed direction and said “not
to worry you are much more likely to
be bombed next month while Christ-
mas shopping”.
T-minus 11 hours:
After removing the main parts of
their float from their temporary home
of the faculty car park we decided to
get some warmth and devoured a mid-
night snack of bolognaise prepared in
the warmth of Jez’s garage.
T-minus 9 hours:
With the construction going well we
decided to start to pretty up the float
with another layer of paint. Given the
cold weather and it being the dead of
night we didn’t hold much hope of it
drying.
T-minus 7 hours:
Disaster struck. Our fancy mecha-
nism for moving the ball around failed.
The magic of duck tape was put to
the test. After a quick fix we tried and
failed again. Things weren’t looking
good. Finally after borrowing some ex-
tra supports everything was fine.
T-minus 4 hours:
After a sleepless night putting final
touches to it the lorry arrives. Every-
one, wrecked and bruised, struggled
to lift the 3m tall structure onto it and
finally all was done. In record time it
was strapped down and sent on its way
with Jez following inder her own steam.
The float was joined on the lorry by Bo
who was helped along Exhibition Road
under the careful watch of a number of
police.
T-minus 3 hours:
With the lorry gone we grabbed eve-
rything we needed, collected 120 he-
lium balloons and set off on the tube.
T-minus 2.5 hours:
While taking up half a tube with bal-
loons the shit hit the fan. The overly
tired coordinator had left our all im-
portant documentation in the office.
With a quick fix of someone running
back in place we continued on hoping
to meet up with everyone.
T-minus 1 hour:
All aboard. We all piled on the lorry
tied down the balloons and headed off.
Finally the hard work was done.
With the show completed and having
passed without incident we dumped
the float [Editor – which remained out-
side the Skempton building for the next
four days, much to the irritation of the
Union which was threatened with a fine
from College as a result!] and collapsed
in the Union for a few well deserved
drinks. Plans for further drinking were
soon scrapped and a nice meal in the
Queens Arms sufficed.
Thanks go to everyone who helped
with the construction and on the day.
We would like to especially thank BP
for their generous sponsorship.
