The C&G Motor Club Committee
A
fter an extremely hectic
first week which mainly
involved the committee
fillingoutformsandwrit-
ing large cheques, twenty
lucky people descended upon the kart
garage at 8:45pm on Wednesday, the
13th of October, to mark the first event
of the year; a trip to one of the world’s
largest indoor kart tracks at The Race-
way, at King’s Cross. Expectations were
high for the night race which was due
to start at half past ten, with all 20 karts
on track at once for qualifying and two
25 minute races.
Naturally, thinking that several
freshers may be late, a rather embar-
rassed Captain FatSlow was the last to
arrive with Lawnmower, but the party
was soon moving. After a brief period
of confusion which saw the group get
split into two on the way to South Ken-
sington station, confidence that we
would still have 20 by the time we got
to King’s Cross diminished slightly…
but somehow we all managed to get on
the tube with everybody still intact.
The walk from King’s Cross was
uneventful with the exception of the
world cup match between England and
France ending while we were on the
tube…and French Fry’s canned ram-
page cranked up a notch as England
kick their way into another world cup
save. There was generally poor lighting
to the venue, which looked very much
like an abandoned warehouse until
we all walked around the back which
revealed a rather lavish looking hospi-
tality entrance to The Raceway, deco-
rated with pictures of various famous
racing drivers that have floored throt-
tle pedals in anger, including Nigel
Mansell, Jenson Button, and Michael
Schumacher.
Once signed in our suits were issued,
and we walked into the rather large
changing rooms, thinking that some-
thing about this place was going to
be a bit grander than expected. Walk-
ing into the race hangar (really, there’s
no better word for it), we stood wide
eyed at a spectacle of twists, turns,
long straights, floodlit barriers, and
banked corners (yes, banked corners
in go-karts!!) that was Europe’s longest
indoor kart track. After a cheeky chat
with the race director, which resulted
in some of the names on the timing
screen being replaced with our motor
club nicknames, we all got out safely on
track for our ten minute practice and
qualifying session, where our fastest
lap would determine our grid position.
The karts were surprisingly good,
fast, precise, and most importantly
very close to each other in terms of
speed. While the freshers got used
to the karts, the motor club commit-
tee wasted no time setting the track
ablaze, and the end of the session saw
The Boss on top, followed by Captain
FatSlow, Lube Boy, Dr. Jones, French
Fry, Bob the Builder, 2% Lager and Bal-
lerina. After what seemed like an eter-
nity on the forming up lap, the safety
kart pulled in for the rolling start and
the first race was go!
The Boss got off to a flying start
with FatSlow sniffing his exhaust, but
unable to pass. Meanwhile, a massive
scrap for third through sixth ensued
while freshers spun all over the place
behind the committete, resulting in
yellow flags and bunching the pack up
again on just lap three, with the front
two kart’s small lead destroyed. When
racing resumed, Captain FatSlow mys-
teriously got a blue flag to let the kart
behind pass despite being on the lead
lap! Ignoring it three times before de-
ciding they were signalling for him,
he reluctantly got out of the way to
let what turned out to be French Fry
past…and the three karts behind him
as well, cunningly stealing the space
FatSlow had left.
This error on the marshals’ part
made for an interesting race now – de-
spite The Boss driving away out front,
FatSlow was now demoted to 6th and
had to play catch up. Meahwile, French
Fry was given a stern looking at as he
kept taking his hands off the wheel to
signal angrily at the backmarkers.
Meanwhile, Henry, the highest quali-
fying newcomer in 8th place, had a dis-
astrous start and was in 12th place by
lap two, being forced likewise to play
catch-up. CJ, starting in 10th, was in-
volved in an interesting coming togeth-
er and was also demoted to 19th off the
start line, which left Arsen, starting in
9th, no time to waste as he took 8th
place and held a considerable gap to
the crowd behind. Henry was immedi-
ately back on the ball, however, as he
regained two places by lap three and
passed David by the end of lap five to
put himself, incredibly, only one place
behind where he started the race! Now,
however, he was being relentlessly har-
“The karts were
fast, precise and
most importantly
close to each
other in speed”
“Fatslow
unleashed a
can of whoop-
ass, setting the
fastest lap”
Captain FatSlow intimidates The Boss with his evil stare of
doom...or not, since The Boss wasn’t paying attention
Altogether now... “VROOOOOM!”
