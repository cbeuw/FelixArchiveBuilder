Strapping up the thumb
Hannah Barr

A thumb sprain is a partial tearing of
the ulnar collateral ligament and is
commonly associated with contact
sports such as rugby, as well as foot-
ball goalkeepers, volleyball, skiing and
gymnastics. Today I’ll focus on rugby.
This injury is particularly common
within rugby due to the aggressive at-
tacking nature of the game. It can oc-
cur when sufficient force is applied to
the thumb in a direction away from
the hand. This could be as a result of
catching the ball, where the ball hits
the top of the thumb forcibly bending
it, when tackling or when being tack-
led, and also during a maul when the
opponent will try to prise thumb and
fingers away from the ball to effectively
(albeit painfully) loosen grip.
Due to this particularly rough sport,
often players choose to protect the
thumbs with a support bandage dur-
ing training and matches. However
this may prove to be uncomfortable
and make gripping and catching more
challenging due to reduced hand and
thumb mobility.
Signs and symptoms of a thumb
sprain will be pain and tenderness
over the ulnar collateral ligament of
the thumb. This ligament is located at
the ‘web space’ between the base of the
thumb and the base of the index fin-
ger. This ligament supports pinch and
grasp activities, and helps the hand
function properly.
Due to the often traumatic and/or
‘accidental’ nature of this injury there
are usually no signs and symptoms.
However following injury you may
notice some or all of these symptoms:
thumb pain, thumb swelling and bruis-
ing, loss of range of motion and func-
tional ability, poor grip.
If you are uncertain about what dam-
age has actually taken place, it is advis-
able to consult a sports injury expert/
GP in order to treat it effectively.
Ice packs and compressions are the
best treatments immediately follow-
ing injury, alongside rest and elevation
where possible. Sprains are usually re-
solved in around 4-6 weeks and can be
aided by physiotherapy and/or sports
remedial massage treatment. For addi-
tional pain relief, use anti-inflammato-
ry gels and/or NSAID’s.
Strapping up the thumb is relatively
simple, and these guidelines should
help. An underwrap is used to protect
skin from abrasion during play, and
particularly when pulling taping off.
Elastic adhesive bandage (EAB) is a
flexible tape that provides support, but
allows some movement and stretch.
This protective layer will help prevent
further damage during play. Obviously
due to the aggressive nature of rugby,
the player will still need to attack or
defend in the same way as usual, so
the support is simply there to act as a
barrier to tissue damage. It does not
mean the injured part will not be dam-
aged further. In an ideal, and perhaps
sensible world, participation would be
halted until the injury had recovered
fully, but usually injuries such as this
that are often deemed as ‘small’ and
‘insignificant’ knocks will not bring an
end to play, but this depends largely on
an individuals pain threshold!
You could use the EAB support meth-
od once injury has actually occurred
because it will provide greater stabil-
ity and protection. Then, if preferred,
use a more flexible support when ap-
plying as a preventative measure, such
as a tubi-grip/modified wrist splint, so
more movement is possible whilst also
giving some support.
It is recommended that remedial
exercise should focus on regaining
dexterity, mobility and strength of the
thumb, fingers and hand as a whole.
Regaining dexterity can be done with
therapeutic putty, hand therapy balls
will relieve thumb stiffness whilst re-
sistance exercises that tax grip ability
will restore normal hand and thumb
strength.
In order to avoid this in the future, it
comes back to the preventative meas-
ure of taping-up during play, or simply
being prepared with the correct first
aid provisions to deal with the acute
phase, i.e. RICE (refer to previous is-
sue) if it occurs.
Week 7 and a lot more results are in.
The ranking of the teams is based on
the Felix Index (FI), which is calculated
as follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) – (L*4).
Only teams with 5 games or more will
be considered in the overall champion-
ship at the end of year.
With this week’s results in, Net-
ball 1st, Squash Men’s 1st and Tennis
Men’s 2nd (this week’s Team of the
Week) continue their unbeaten streak
and are top of the table with 25 points
each. With the Hockey Men’s 1st los-
ing their fixture on Wednesday, they
slip 5 places to 9th and are replaced by
Rugby Men’s 1st in 4th place.
A mid table scrap is beginning to
emerge between the men’s Badminton
2s and Rugby 3s, as well as the ladies
Football, Lacrosse and Squash
At the bottom of the table, the poor
start to the season by Hockey Men’s
4th and Football Men’s 2nd, leave them
both rooted to the bottom of the table.

The winner of last week’s crossword
was Alex Crosse. Well done sir. Please
do keep the entries coming in – hope-
fully there will be a prize draw of some
kind at the end of the year and you
might be in with a chance of winning
that £800,000. No lie. Well, when I say
that I mean the prize draw isn’t a lie...
the bonanza prize might be slightly
less than 800 very big ones.
Enjoy this week’s crossword!
