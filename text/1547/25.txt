Rules
are
as
always:
draw
a
single
closed
loop
by
verti-
cally
and
horizontally
joining
the
dots
so
that
the
num-
bered
squares
are
surrounded
by
the
corresponding
number
of
lines.
The numbers in each row and
column tell you how many
groups of black squares are in a
row or column, as well as how
many black squares each group
is made up of. Filling in the grid
produces a pretty picture,
which in turn produces points
if you send it in, so get solving!

Another little teaser
You are stuck in a room with no
windows, and no doors. The
walls, floor and ceiling are solid
stone, and there seems to be no
way out. The only contents of the
room are a table and a saw.
How do you escape?
And yes - it will drive you crazy in
the process.
