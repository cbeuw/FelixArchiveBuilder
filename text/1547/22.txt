Screenwriters: Roberto Orci, Alex
Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Gene
Roddenberry
Starring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto,
Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana,
Karl Urban, Alice Eve, Simon Pegg
Director J. J. Abrams no doubt reig-
nited the dying Star Trek franchise
and this follow-up to his 2009 reboot
further cements his reputation as a
director capable of delivering plenty
of fun as well as a more than ade-
quate plot and heart.
Our beloved characters are still
all there; Pine once again nails be-

Mud
Director: Jeff Nichols
Screenwriter: Jeff Nichols
Starring: Matthew McConaughey,
Tye Sheridan, Jacob Lofland, Reese
Witherspoon, Michael Shannon,
Sam Shepard, Sarah Paulson, Ray
McKinnon
Reese Witherspoon is a bad girl these days
reard for the rules, Quinto makes a
welcome return and still has plenty
to do as Spock, the half-human, half-
Vulcan with identity crisis. It’s really
Quinto who always has the tougher
job of having to juggle a wide range of
conﬂicting emotions. Vulnerable, ro-
botic, sensitive, idealistic, he embod-
ies all these things, and Quinto is no
doubt an invaluable addition.
Because Into Darkness has bigger
things on its mind, trying to deliver
on the most impressive action scenes
Hitting the screens almost exactly
one year after its showing at the
2012 Cannes Film Festival, “Mud”
(McConaughey) is a wanted fugitive
who puts far too much on the line
in the name of love. Hiding out on a
deserted island, he longs to be reu-
nited with the love of his life Juniper
(Witherspoon), although this ambi-
tious plan of his is put in jeopardy
as he is constantly hunted by shady
characters who are clearly acting
above the law.
But despite the title, the focus of
the ﬁlm isn’t entirely on Mud’s plans:
director Jeﬀ Nichols tells the story in
the point of view of two young, naive
boys (Sheridan, Loﬂand) who like an
adventure: and they’re certainly in
for the most unforgettable event of
their lives.
Ellis (Sheridan) and Neckbone (Lo-
ﬂand) are best of friends who regu-
larly go on river excursions riding
around in their boat and bike. One
day they stumble upon and befriend a
mysterious man who has a lot to hide
and needs protection.
Dealing with things that are far be-
yond their maturity level, the boys are
initially hesitant about helping this
shadowy ﬁgure, but knowing that it’s
true love that gives Mud his drive,
it’s Ellis who gets more stuck in, with
his innocent views on how love, rela-
tionships and marriage work, whilst
a sweet love life of his own seems
to develop. Things at home are also
rocky, further shattering his already
fragile ideas on love. His parents are
throwing around the much-dreaded
D word, and this potential separation
also hits him hard.
Set in parts of America you prob-
ably never knew existed, its rich,
warm visuals embrace the long line
of complex characters who are far
more than they appear to be. Just
what is Mud running from? Why are
State Troopers hunting him down?
Is Juniper really the beautiful sweet-
heart Mud thinks she is? Is what they
share true love? Confusing for the au-
dience, so imagine how baﬄing this
must be for the kids in the middle of
this.
The adult cast is excellent (McCo-
naughey’s been piling on one fasci-
nating performance after another
over the recent years - after Magic
Mike and Killer Joe, he is once again
on ﬁne form), but the real winning
performances here are those of the
child actors.
Sheridan, in his second ﬁlm after
Malick’s Tree of Life, shines display-
ing natural stoic bravery, and Loﬂand
is equally brilliant in his screen de-
but.
It’s not as powerful or touching as
Nichols’ previous directorial outing,
the hauntingly beautiful Take Shel-
ter, but here is a layered and reward-
ing coming-of-age story, somewhat
with a similar feel to Stand By Me,
made even more so thanks to Lof-
land’s striking resemblance to the
young River Phoenix.
it can possibly manage, you do see
certain characters becoming more
side-lined for the sake of making
room and freeing up the screen time.
But everyone, ranging from Saldana,
John Cho, Pegg, Anton Yelchin, Ur-
ban and Eve, is given their chance to
stand out, and their own unique per-
sonality quirks to play around with.
What sets this apart from the orig-
inal is however, the perfect casting
of a solid villian. Britain’s very own
Sherlock, Cumberbatch, takes on the
role of John Harrison, someone who
single-handedly declares war on the
good guys. His one-man army is not
to be laughed at given both the skills
and rage he possesses. He is one ca-
pable of causing some serious dam-
age, and Cumberbatch, with his tall
frame, cold, still looks and sinister
delivery of his dialogue, has no trou-
ble passing as the one person who
could possibly destroy all. His char-
acter is not all about him wanting to
destroy the world for no reason what-
soever, he does have more to add to
enrich the plot, with Cumberbatch
showing a wider spectrum of person-
alities that bring out his initially vil-
lainous character.
It’s a predictably loud and action-
packed aﬀair, but one with intelli-
gence and focus in telling a coherent
story. What starts oﬀ as a straight-
forward “good guy goes hunting
for the psychotic bad guy” becomes
a lot wordier (and this is a good
thing) with back stories and double-
crossings that is kept up by the ﬁlm’s
healthy pace and many bursts of col-
ourful sci-ﬁ action.
