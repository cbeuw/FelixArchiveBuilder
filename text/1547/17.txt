My revision poem
FRIDAY 17 MAY 19
Martin Asprusten writes a poem about his exam woe to the tune
of The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe
Upon a day in springtime warming out-
side birds and bees were swarming,
I recalled, with passion forming, sunny
days of springs of yore
Days of sunny spring enticing, days of
song and dance comprising
but, alas!, I was revising things I should
have learnt before
“Stop wasting time”, I reprimanded,
“reminiscing lo’ers your score.
Only that, and nothing more”
Settling down to solve the paper, my re-
solve began to taper
My inner self became a vapour, drifting
to some distant shore
From the dreamer’s lofty station, I sur-
veyed the whole Creation
But I knew my concentration had been
broken at its core
My ignorance seemed overpowering,
and exams were at the door
“Why did I not read before?”
And as such the days went flying, noth-
ing learnt and slowly dying
Tied down by the shackles of the not-
quite-studying I deplore
Mere mortals would with great sensa-
tion gawp at my procrastination
Witnessing the daft deflation of the
knowledge I could store
When exams were over I received the e-
mail I abhore
“Weak 2:2 and nothing more”
As I did my awful reading, I could see
my life proceeding
into joblessness and needing, what
were these last four years for?
I heartfeltedly regretted: “Now I’m
heavily indebted,
and my life is nearly wasted if I can’t im-
prove my score”
I would go and see my tutor, throw my-
self upon his floor
It’s not much I’m asking for
Shutting down the school computer,
shaking like a nervous suitor
I went to ask my personal tutor if he
could my grades restore
Almost prostrate there before him, I
heartshakingly implored him
“I was stupid, wasting time, I know I
could do so much more
Would you let me resit this exam to get
a better score?”
Qouth the tutor “Nevermore”
I explained that I had faltered, if I could
have anything altered
I would have gone back in time and
made it so I studied more
“Everything we’ve studied, tested in
two weeks, with so much vested
is it strange that I was bested by the
pressure and the chore?
Will I ever have a job where I won’t have
to sweep the floor?”
Quoth the tutor “Nevermore”

Oh, and, yeah, it does look like that guy from your school who’s now at Leeds is having a lot more fun at university than you are...
