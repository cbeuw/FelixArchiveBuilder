Hipster mice display neurological individuality
ndividuality seems to be more
of an adolescent dilemma for
picking proÔ¨Åle pictures than
it may be for neuroscientists,
but research this week shows
that they too are worrying just how to
stand out from the crowd. Donning
their lab coats and grabbing their mi-
croscopes rather than a mirror and an
iPhone, researchers at the Salk Insti-
tute for Biological Studies in Califor-
nia may have pinpointed the reason-
ing for what makes us all that little bit
diÔ¨Äerent.
The study, centred on groups of ge-
netically identical mice, identiÔ¨Åed how
neurological diÔ¨Äerences may contrib-
ute to individuality in tandem with en-
vironmental inÔ¨Çuences. When kept in
the same complex enclosure for three
months, it was seen that the brains of
the mice altered diÔ¨Äerently in regards
to what they did.
This alteration is referred to as
‚Äúbrain plasticity,‚Äù and is, broadly
speaking, the mechanism behind how
long term memories derived from
what is experienced are stored via the
hippocampus.
Plasticity is the alteration of neu-
ronal connections within the brain,
with certain connections becom-
ing more stable between the groups
of neurons involved in ‚Äústoring‚Äù the
memory. It is this physiological change
that allows for certain memories to
be recalled much more easily in the
future, and the researchers are now
suggesting that neuronal diÔ¨Äerences
in the genetically identical mice may
be contributing to their ‚Äúindividual-
ity.‚Äù The term individuality here was
considered to cover any diÔ¨Äerences in
behaviour, problem solving, patterns
of exploration or even idiosyncrasies
seen between the groups of genetically
identical mice.
The mice, whilst exploring their en-
closure, were tagged with transpond-
ers and had antennae attached to track
their movements. After the three
months, the mice were then surgically
assessed to determine plasticity diÔ¨Äer-
ence by counting proliferating precur-
sor cells within their hippocampus.
With previous studies showing that
these cells are crucial to neurogenesis-
the production of new neurons ‚Äì and
increase through physical and cogni-
tive activity, it was found that mice
that had diÔ¨Äerent exploratory behav-
iour had diÔ¨Äerent numbers of neurons
being generated, and thus, introduced
elements of individuality into the
groups of mice.
Although this seems very much self-
explanatory to the general free-think-
ing scientist (of course experience is
going to deÔ¨Åne individuality, isn‚Äôt that
obvious), this is the Ô¨Årst case of being
able to quantify just how plasticity can
be altered by measurable interactions.
It is the Ô¨Årst direct link between be-
haviour and plasticity, but should not
be considered as entirely indicative of
environmental inÔ¨Çuences alone con-
tributing to who we are.
Despite these mice being geneti-
cally similar, their behaviour was not
identical at the beginning of the study,
hinting at some variation that may oc-
cur at a much earlier developmental
stage. Such diÔ¨Äerences were merely
ampliÔ¨Åed by the interactive complex
they were placed in and the next step
is to pinpoint just what might cause
these diÔ¨Äerences at a more precise
level.
For now though, this study hints at
why even identical twins brought up
in the same household, surrounded
by the same people, may be two com-
pletely diÔ¨Äerent people personality-
wise.
So, teenagers of the world, want to
convey just how individual you are?
Put down the phone, wipe oÔ¨Ä the
eyeliner and step outside; a picture
may be worth a thousand words but
experience seems to be worth more
neuronal plasticity than we are yet to
quantify.
