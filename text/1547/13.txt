Stephanie Walton interviews our very own CBE winner, FRS and researcher
limate physicist Profes-
sor Joanna Haigh is en-
joying a glittering start
to 2013. In recognition
of her services to Physics
she was appointed Commander of
the British Empire (CBE) in the New
Year Honours and earlier this month
she was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Society (FRS).
She is also the first female Head
of Physics at Imperial in a still pre-
dominantly male department; in-
credibly there are nine times more
male academics than female. Despite
a hectic schedule, she found time to
chat about her career and route to
the top.
Stephanie Walton: Have you al-
ways wanted to be a Physicist?
Professor Joanna Haigh: After my
undergraduate degree I wanted to
retrain as a medic but I could not af-
ford it. Instead I studied for a MSc
in Meteorology at Imperial and en-
joyed it so much I became hooked.
Imperial was different in the 70s; I
got thrown out of the Union Bar
since only men were allowed. Impe-
rial is a lot more friendly these days.
SW: Was your doctorate plain sail-
ing or were there moments of ex-
asperation over malfunctioning
experiments?
JH: Of course there were moments
of exasperation. I had a computer
model which kept crashing and it
took me weeks to work out why.
SW: Was it hard researching whilst
raising three small children?
JH: It took some organising, but the
department was very supportive. My
research profile suffered a bit of a
dip though.
SW: What do you do as Head of
Department?
JH: It is quite demanding. I deal with
our research excellence framework,
promotions, faculty management is-
sues, health and safety, fellowships…
It is fun though and I am very proud
and honoured to have been chosen
to do it.
SW: Tell me about your CBE. Do
you know who nominated you?
JH: I have no idea. I was informed
by letter and it came as a complete
surprise. I went to Windsor Castle to
collect the award. It was a lovely oc-
casion and the Queen asked me very
sensible questions. She was very im-
pressive for a lady of her age.
SW: I lost count trying to enumer-
ate papers you have published. Do
you remember writing all of them
and do any stand out in particular?
JH: I know some better than others.
A couple have been pleasingly influ-
ential for example the paper I pub-
lished in 1996 on solar radiation and
its effect on the stratosphere. Some
of the things we said were picked up
on and have been developed into a
whole new area of interest.
SW: You are a climate model ex-
pert. How do these models work?
JH: You’ve got me on my favourite
topic! They are amazing! Basically
you write down four equations, solve
them on a discrete grid and integrate
forward in time. The model shows
you jet streams and weather pat-
terns, just like the real world!
SW: As a climate physicist, are you
conscious of your carbon foot-
print? Do you fly?
JH: I do fly but only if I can justify
it and I try to combine trips. I drive
a little electric car into College. I
charge it every night at home. It’s
quite cheap to run but replacing the
battery is very expensive.
SW: What would you do if you had in-
fluence in government?
JH: I would raise carbon taxes and invest
in alternative energy sources.
SW: Do you have any advice for scien-
tists at the beginning of their careers?
JH: It is tough. You need to maintain an
interest, work hard and not be afraid to
ask for advice. Don’t cry in a corner if
things don’t work.
Not the bees! Not the bees! Neonicotinoid ban comes with a sting
The European Union has voted in fa-
vour of a ban on neonicotinoids, the
most widely used pesticide in the
world. However, with ﬁerce behind-
the-scenes campaigns and passionate
lobbying from all parties involved, this
result was by no means easily decid-
ed. So why have neonicotinoids been
banned? How much will this help
honey bee populations? And why does
it matter to us?
Neonicotinoids were developed to
eﬀectively kill unwanted insects on
crops while being harmless to hu-
mans and other mammals. However,
whilst their use across the world has
increased over recent decades, honey
bee numbers have plummeted. This
does not seem to be a coincidental
correlation; several high proﬁle sci-
entiﬁc studies have linked neonicoti-
noids to the decline of honey bees. A
paper published in Science last year
found that exposure to the insecticide
caused an 85% reduction in the pro-
duction of queen bees, which are cru-
cial to establish new colonies.
This is vitally important as bees do
so much more than make honey –
they are estimated to pollinate a third
of the food we eat. A much quoted
remark states that: "If the bee disap-
peared oﬀ the surface of the globe,
man would only have four years of
life left. No more bees, no more pol-
lination, no more plants, no more
animals, no more man." Though there
is a lack of consensus over who actu-
ally said this, let alone how accurate a
prediction it is, its foreboding vision
indicates just how instrumental bees
are to life as we know it.
In Hanyuan County, China, where
bees have already been wiped out by
the use of pesticides, farmers have re-
sorted to employing people to hand
pollinate pear trees with feather dust-
ers and paint brushes. Friends of the
Earth have estimated that to do this
for crops in the UK would cost £1.8bn
a year, a sum which would no doubt be
reﬂected in the price of food.
With a 53% fall in managed Brit-
ish bee colonies since 1985 mirror-
ing similar drops worldwide, declin-
ing pollinator populations have been
identiﬁed as a serious risk to global
food production – the last thing we
need with an ever-growing human
population to feed.
Therefore falling bee
numbers represent
not only a conserva-
tion issue, but also
a serious economic
and social issue.
But how far will the
ban on neonicoti-
noids go to reversing
this alarming trend?
The short answer
is, we do not know.
There is no general
agreement on the
cause of the world-
wide collapse in
honey bee colonies.
Instead, the phe-
nomenon (termed
colony collapse dis-
order in the USA),
has also been attributed to a range of
other factors which include habitat
loss, increasing numbers of parasites
and levels of air pollution.
With this uncertainty in mind, it
may seem strange that a ban on the
most widely used insecticide has
been put in place – especially when
faced with arguments from chemical
companies and UK ministers that this
could negatively impact food produc-
tion through an increase in pest levels.
However, the precautionary principle
is supposed to underlie environmental
regulation.
This means that even without scien-
tiﬁc consensus, there is a responsibil-
ity to protect the public or environ-
ment from harm if a plausible risk is
found. Perhaps the very fact that this
issue has ignited such passionate lob-
bying from both sides illustrates how
the humble honey bee is not only im-
portant environmentally, but is also
instrumental economically and social-
ly – we must do everything possible to
protect pollinators while we still can.
