As someone studying medicine it
seems you should be prepared for
a multitude of exams. Instead, you
whine on Facebook, text banal
complaints to your housemates,
snapchat your food and cry on
the hour, every hour. This week an
engineer knocks you out with his
wad of notes for the 13 exams he is
sitting this summer, and everyone
cheers.
This week, you decide it is a good
idea to offer an internship to a lo-
cal boys school. A mean student
union attempt to get a hashtag
treading using painfully forced
alliteration and you are forced to
tell poor Timmy, who spent all
his pocket money on the bid, he
can’t design MRI machines now to
make his mother better. He cries,
but justice was done.
Conceding defeat over your ﬁnal
year project, you decide you will
never understand brain organisa-
tion and slump back in your chair,
disheartened. Outside, a petting
zoo is soothing stressed students,
so you steal a guinea pig at a last
ditch attempt for some practical
learning. Half way through your
craniotomy, the BUAV attack and
bundle you in to a nearby van.
You and your friend decide to visit
Africa this week. Upon meeting
some small, hungry children at
the side of the road, you lovingly
feed them pineapple pieces. Your
friend, envious of your humanitar-
ian tendencies, proceeds to throw
chocolate biscuits at their faces.
They ﬁght to the death over the
biscuits and your friend cackles
manically.
Despite being a fully grown man
you decide it is acceptable to go
to Lego Land, on a bank holiday,
alone without any children. The
childhood suppression mixed
with an acute awareness of look-
ing like a paedophile leads you
to begin to manically stick Lego
bricks repeatedly up your arse, in
full view of the families nearby.
The mother gives you a wink.
Due to your disregard for cud-
dling and going home without a
McDonalds, you decide to take
your latest Metric-derived dis-
aster to your office for a speedy
session before returning to the
dancefloor. The pressure to per-
form mixed with low budget
cocktails render him insufferably
flaccid. You tie him up and leave
him there.
You are currently sitting in the li-
brary cafe, aren’t you? You should
totally buy one of those depress-
ingly soggy and foul tasting jacket
potatoes. Put plenty of plastic
cheese on top, and maybe a bit of
mayo to ease the perpetual dry-
ness of both this situation, your
meal and the possibility of your
sex life being fun. Proceed to cry
deeply at your predicament.
In a desperate attempt at exciting
yourlatestsexualvictim,youfetch
copious amounts of mint lube,
then begin to apply it everywhere
– his chest, his face, and across
the room. Classic fluid dynamics
mixed with funnelling gin results
in the inability to remain perched
upon his penis, and you fall off
repeatedly until he leaves, sliding
slowly away.
It seems that the DPE position is
now open for re-elections, so be-
gin to make your publicity mate-
rial ahead of time in anticipation
ofanothervigorouslyexciting,po-
litically fuelled election fortnight.
You get too excited and proceed
to iron DP accidently onto your
forehead, leading to an awkward
dinner party with your family
when you return for the weekend.
Still in Africa this week, you de-
cide it is a good idea to parade
around in short shorts whilst set-
ting traps within the forest. One
particularly high trap is stuck, so
you ask a local woodcutter, wield-
ing a machete, to come help. He
instead bludgeons you to pieces
then feeds you to the tropical but-
terflies. Your supervisor cackles
manically.
You come to your office early one
morning to ﬁnd a pale, tired and
worn out chemist tied up to the
ﬁling cabinet. You decide with the
30-year old, creepy work experi-
ence guy that paid £1000 for this
opportunity gone this guy can be
your bitch for the day. You make
him alternate between sending
badly spelt emails and sucking you
off.
Your latest habit of updating peo-
ple of the word count of your ﬁnal
yearprojectisgettingtoomuchto
bear for one usually placid female.
Do it again and I will cut your dick
into as many pieces as the words
you have claimed to have written,
then throw them into the air like
confetti. Consider this a warning.
She goes through with dick cut-
ting anyway, just for fun.
