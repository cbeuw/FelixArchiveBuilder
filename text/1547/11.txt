12 FRIDAY 17 MAY
t ﬁrst sign, North Acton
station appears prettier
than most – there’s even
a cherry tree in front
of the ticket barriers.
Travel time from South Kensington:
45 minutes 18 seconds. That’s 45 met-
ric minutes at 60 seconds/minute, not
these new 80 second imperial-Acton
minutes that the college use in their
30 minute estimate for travel time.
So we’ve all heard about how terri-
ble Acton is going to be – but how bad
really is it? I took a couple of trips to
ﬁnd out.
Transportwise, things aren’t bril-
liant. Apart from the journey time,
there’s a single night bus that serves
North Acton, with two services per
hour to Hammersmith. Given that
Hammersmith isn’t all that close
to campus and isn’t exactly known
for its nightlife, it’s unlikely to be of
much use Imperial Students. Oh, and
the cost? A yearly zones 1&2 student
Ben Fernando takes a trip to the new hall’s location to investigate
North Acton: How bad is it really?
travel card comes in at an aﬀordable
£848, or roughly 20% of my mainte-
nance loan.
Okay, so what about safety – is the
nickname ‘Crackton’ really warrant-
ed? Well, er… possibly. Apart from
having almost twice the amount of
violent crime as a proportion of to-
tal crime that South Kensington has,
there seem to be a few issues with an-
tisocial behaviour and cannabis farm-
ing. News headlines on the town’s
website inform us that:
• Dispersal zones have been estab-
lished; police warn, ‘you may be re-
moved to your home’
• ’15 year old boy stabbed’
• ‘Man injured after stabbing’
• ‘Three men jailed for armed rob-
bery’
And, just in case you were wonder-
ing, Ealing had a ‘record number of
rubbish complaints’ in 2012 – 55,407.
So assuming the intrepid freshers
overcome their fears of violent crime
and lots of rubbish, can they expect a
good student experience?
‘Not really’, says a University of the
Arts London student living in the
tower block adjacent to the station.
She tells me that there’s not really
much to do apart from taking the bus
into Shepherd’s Bush. Oh, and she
sometimes goes to the local ASDA,
which just so happens to be the same
ASDA where the three men were re-
cently jailed for breaking , entering
and assaulting a security guard and
threatening to kill him. But don’t wor-
ry, the local corner shop has installed
‘anti-burglar fog’, whatever that is.
Well, perhaps other students who
already live there have diﬀerent views
about Acton? Or not. ‘There’s not
much to do’, complains Amit Rungk-
wansirirog, an international student
at UAL, ‘it’s inconvenient’. I caught her
in her pyjamas as she wandered over
to the local shop for some milk, as she
expressed annoyance that the nearest
A
big shops were four tube stops away.
Westﬁeld seems to have become these
students’ saving grace, providing the
only entertainment and nightlife in
the area. It’s a convenient 45 minutes
away by night bus.
On the plus side, there seem to be
a number of gambling establishments
for the betting type. In addition to the
convenience store, closed coﬀee shop
and bank there was a Ladbrokes’ and
a William Hill just a few hundred feet
from the main entrance to the existing
accommodation. Clearly the students
have found new uses for their time
and money.
Determined to ﬁnd something ex-
citing to do, I pressed on. First on
the attraction list is Gypsy Corner,
where the six-lane remnant of the
M40 careens down a hill. For traﬃc
light aﬁcionados, the area is deﬁnitely
well worth a visit, but perhaps not for
cyclists. Facing a six mile journey to
College, it’s only a matter of time un-
til a student joins the ranks of cyclists
killed over the last few years on the
A40.
I prefer trains to cars, so I travelled
on the train line. Acton students will
have a prime location for watching
the high-speed services out of Eus-
ton, and, as I was glad to discover, in
watching the planes come into Heath-
row. Needless to say I got quite a kick
from seeing not one, but two A380s
coming in to land! You could almost
say it was the highlight of the entire
trip.
So, it really does seem as if Acton is
what it’s made out to be: a commuter
suburb with few local amenities or at-
traction, and a serious issue with an-
tisocial behaviour. It might be okay if
you’re middle aged and own a car, but
will seven hundred non street-smart
freshers who are living away from
home for the ﬁrst time in North Ac-
ton have a good experience? I think
not.
