Rap Lyrics of
the Week
“All my freshers
That know I’m the freshest
It’s first year you want a first
Tonight I’ll pray you’ll get it”
An Imperial lyric if ever there is
one.I’msureIcansafelysaythatwe
would all like to thank Chipmunk
for praying that we get a first. Al-
though notice that he is choosing
to do the least amount of work
possible to help you get a first. He
could, if he really gave a shit, offer
to quiz you on your notes, help you
find a past paper, and so on. How-
ever he will instead be praying that
you get it. So, essentially, he’ll be
just sitting down at home going “I
hope they pass”. That’s not actually
very helpful at all.

music”

How to win an election...
Dear potential Summer Election Can-
didates, many of you will have little ex-
perience of campaigning or marketing
or the Union elections, so Hangman
has put together a guide of things to
say and things to do to get elected.
1. Catchy, witty slogan. Even bet-
ter if your name/initials rhyme with
the position you’re running for.
B,C,D,E,G,P,T, or V at the end of your
name whilst running for DPE would
be perfect. Change your name if it
doesn’t rhyme.
2. Snappy Poster. Even Joseph Fritzl
could win the election with a snappy,
well-designed (doesn’t look like it was
made on Paint) poster. Honestly, that’s
how lazy many people are with their
vote, even a massive prick like him
could win.
3. Open [name random College ser-
vice] for an extra day per week.
4. ‘Better postgraduate representa-
tion’. Both postgrads that vote will def-
fo go for you now! You’re already head
and shoulders above the competition,
who deﬁnitely won’t think of this tac-
tic too.
5. Join shedloads of clubs and socie-
ties to pad your manifesto with your
‘involvement in the Union at all levels’.
If you actually do a sport that could
help to guarantee some votes from
your club.
6. Go to A RAG event at some point
in your time at Imperial and say you
were a ‘regular fundraiser’ and how
you will do more if elected.
7. Write an article for Felix about
something, at some point. Call your-
self a regular contributor.
8. Cheaper Drinks. Your position
has no power to change it but 2 years
of increases is unbelievable, SORT IT
OUT. Or at least promise too…
9. No one should pay for entry to
the Union. They could just go an hour
earlier, but fuck that.
10. Dizzee Rascal at the Summer
Ball. Prove you’re ‘down with the kids’
by promising this. Yo.
11. WHATEVER YOU DO DON’T
EMAIL ALL UNDERGRADUATES
ASKING THEM TO VOTE FOR
YOU. Wreaks of desperation and the
last thing we want is another Email
Storm in exam term.
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY
PROMISE TO ‘WORK TOWARDS’
OR ‘CAMPAIGN FOR’ THINGS
BECAUSE THAT WAY IF THEY
DON’T HAPPEN IT ISN’T YOUR
FAULT BECAUSE YOU PROMISED
NOTHING!!!!
The Hangman way to getting everyone chanting your name
Gudda Gudda: “Bedrock”
“Let’s buy a place with all kinds of
space”
Presumably there will be just one
type of space? As in... space.
Al-Assad glad to be finally getting
international recognition
Hangman’s Finest College News Source
the turnip
P
resident of Syria, Bashar
Al-Assad has been quoted
this week as being “de-
lighted” to have ﬁnally
achieved international
recognition for his brutal suppression
of the uprising in his country. Speak-
ing to journalists this morning, Al-
Assad expressed surprise that it had
taken 2 years and over 100,000 deaths
for the international community to
take note saying
“I couldn’t ﬁgure out where I was
going wrong; supressed civil liberties
– check; brutal crackdowns – check;
high death toll – check”
“Then it struck me – the genocide
had been far too humane”
The president then proceeded to ex-
plain how instead of “simply shooting
and blowing people up”, he would use
the many “cool” chemical weapons
Syria has been stockpiling for years.
“Two years I’ve been frustrated with
the lack of attention I’ve been receiv-
ing for my atrocities, turns out they
were just too darn run-of-the-mill”
stated the president before adding “I
mean just check out the crazy eﬀects
of that Sarin stuﬀ”.
The president also told the as-
sembled press that he’d considered
“throwing a few nuclear warhead ru-
mours around” but that he thought
that it’s eﬀects “wouldn’t have enough
short term impact, luckily we struck
gold with the chemical weapons idea
– short and snappy”. World lead-
ers came together to say that he was
a “naughty man” as Al-Assad picked
up his Biggest Arsehole of the Year
award.
Even the Cleggman could be elected with the right slogan and a promise for
“A BIGGER, BETTER, MORE INCLUSIVE, BIGGER, BETTER UNION!!!!
