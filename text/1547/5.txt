Lot withdrawn and move condemned
upwards of ¬£7000 per term for tuition,
who could bid for the the opportunity
using the school‚Äôs online auctioning
service. The auction was pulled during
the evening of the same day.
The internship was organised private-
ly by the Department, and had not been
authorized or associated with Imperial
College as a whole. Felix contacted Im-
perial College London for a statement.
A College spokeswoman said: ‚ÄúWork
experience placements at Imperial are
considered locally within the College‚Äôs
departments. A member of staÔ¨Ä had
agreed with Westminster School to
host two work experience placements
for A Level students at the Institute
of Biomedical Engineering, each last-
ing a week. One placement was to be
auctioned, with the proceeds to go to-
wards supporting Westminster School‚Äôs
bursary programme and capital build-
ing projects. The other place was to be
reserved for a pupil from one of West-
minster‚Äôs state school partners.‚Äù
The fundraising auction, which in-
cludes other items, is raising money for
use of ‚Äúexpanding Bursary Programme
as well as cover the expense of the new
facilities [that the school has recently
built]‚Äù
. Other internships on oÔ¨Äer in-
clude a week long placement at Bar-
bara Weiss Architects and Crossbridge
Capital, an investment fund, however
internships are not the only type of lot
up for purchase.
There was no indication that bidding
on the items is only available to mem-
bers of Westminster School, and their
families, however criticism has been
levied at the College for opening its
doors to people based on their ability
to pay. The Imperial College Widen-
ing Participation statement itself states
‚ÄúThe College aims to identify and at-
tract students of the highest academic
ability and potential, and would not
want Ô¨Ånancial considerations to deter
suitable applicants.‚Äù
Felix spoke to Paul Beaumont, Union
President, who informed the paper that
‚Äú[he has] emailed the College Secretary
and Comms team this morning to in-
form them of it.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúI point-
ed out to the comms team the cover-
age this already has in national papers
(Westminster speciÔ¨Åcally, not Imperial)
and asked if they can do something to
stop Imperial‚Äôs association with it. I per-
sonally think that this goes completely
against the idea that students (on an in-
ternship or otherwise!) get in on their
academic merit, not how much they
can aÔ¨Äord to pay.‚Äù
Following the removal of the lot, Im-
perial College published a statement
noting ‚ÄúOn reÔ¨Çection the Institute of
Biomedical Engineering has requested
that the auction place be withdrawn
and is considering the best and fairest
approach to hosting work experience
placements in the future.‚Äù
The Union have also released a state-
ment saying: ‚ÄúThe Sabbatical team asks
the College to still provide and adver-
tise the opportunity to any school pu-
pil, with an attached bursary from the
department suÔ¨Écient so that any pupil
can access the opportunity regardless of
their means.

continued from the front page
>>
to Imperial College Union Council on
30 May discussing how these opportu-
nities are sourced and advertised to A-
level pupils and what constitutes work
experience and an internship for A-lev-
el pupils. This will hopefully mandate
the sabbaticals to further investigate
this issue ensuring that such a situa-
tion where opportunities are provided
to students from only an educationally
advantaged background never happens
again.‚Äù
It has also emerged that Westminster
School was contacted by the Bar Stand-
ards Board over the auction of a one to
two week mini-pupillage with a crimi-
nal defence barrister in London. The
auction site says that the winner will be
able to gain an insight into the world
of a criminal defence barrister. A Bar
Standards Board spokesperson said:
‚ÄúAs regulators, fairness and advancing
equality of opportunity at the Bar is at
the heart of what we do and our direc-
tor is in touch with the head of West-
minster School.‚Äù
