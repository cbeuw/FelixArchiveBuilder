10 FRIDAY 17 MAY
rgan donation can be a
taboo topic, as thinking
about it requires us to
confront our own mor-
tality; something most
of us would prefer not to do. This ta-
boo needs to be tackled, as the mis-
match between the number of people
needing a transplant, and those will-
ing to donate their organs, is vast.
More than 10,000 people in the UK
are currently in need of a transplant,
and of these, 1000 die needlessly each
year whilst on the waiting list. That’s
three people a day dying because they
do not receive an organ in time.
I’m sure most of you are aware of
the theory behind organ transplanta-
tion, however taking a moment to run
through the basic procedure involved
seems sensible. Organ transplantation
is required when a person loses func-
tion of one or more of their organs. A
replacement organ may be required
in order to maintain a good quality of
life, or even in order for them to stay
alive. They could potentially receive

an organ transplant in one of two
ways. A healthy person may choose to
donate a non-vital organ (for instance,
a kidney) to a friend, a member of
their family or even a stranger. Alter-
natively, they could receive an organ
from someone who has chosen to do-
nate their organs in the event of their
death. In this case, the donor’s organs
are allocated to people on the organ
transplant list; a national register of
people needing an organ transplant.
Organ transplantation has the po-
tential to save and transform the lives
of individuals and their families, a
number of whom have suﬀered for
many years with a poor quality of life.
Unfortunately, due to the shortage
of organ donors, the full potential of
organ donation to change lives is not
being fulﬁlled. Whilst almost all of us
would take an organ if we needed one,
only 30% of us are registered organ
donors.
As students at a renowned scientiﬁc
institution, we are being equipped
with skills which have the potential to
improve the lives of people around the
world. But have you considered the
simple act of signing up to the organ
donation register; something that if
we each do individually, collectively
has the potential to put an end to the
unnecessary suﬀering and deaths of
thousands of people?
Organ transplantation has the po-
tential to save and transform the lives
of individuals and their families
So why not take action? Think about
organ donation, consider signing up,
and become part of a lifesaving move-
ment. Because you never know, you
yourself may one day rely on the organ
of a total stranger.
This article is on behalf of The Or-
gan Donor Drive by Imperial Hub. We
want to increase understanding and
awareness of organ donation and also
encourage students to register on the
NHS organ donor list. We will be hold-
ing lectures, discussions and running
stalls from the 13th -20th of May –
please get involved and ﬁnd out more.
How far would you go to save your life
he world was stunned
this week to learn that
actress and director An-
gelina Jolie had a preven-
tive mastectomy to avoid
87% odds of breast cancer due to the
BRCA1 genetic mutation. Seattle per-
former and composer Eva Moon faced
an impossible choice.
Now the touring artist has written a
solo musical about her experience and
will be in London for one performance
only, as a beneﬁt for Macmillan Cancer
Support on Thursday 13th June at our
very own Sir Alexander Fleming Build-
ing.
Lest you think there’s nothing uplift-
ing about such a personal self-exam,
you haven’t seen Ms. Moon’s grasp
of the subject. The Mutant Diaries:
Unzipping My Genes is a feisty, frank,
funny and fearless original musical
comedy about turning a devastat-
ing prognosis into a new lease on life.
Moon shares the humour as well as the
struggle of dealing with a life-changing
personal challenge – and living to
laugh about it – with light-hearted
Katherine Rutherford invites you to join Eva Moon
songs like “Ta Ta, Tatas” and wild tales
from her “Boob Voyage” party to tem-
per the more wrenching and sombre
moments she explores with honesty
and candidness in songs like “Dream-
land”.
In 2011, as her mother was dying of
cancer, Eva learned she had inherited
the BRCA1 genetic mutation from her.
That twist of DNA skyrockets the risk
of getting breast and ovarian cancer to
near certainty. To combat those odds,
she started making plans for surgery
right away. The surgery – surgeries,
actually: a hysterectomy and double
mastectomy— were daunting. But if
she were to forgo the procedures, her
chances of getting cancer were nearly
90 percent.
“I had friends who tried to talk me
out of it. They said, ‘You still have a 13
percent chance of not getting cancer’,”
said Moon. “My response was, ‘Would
you ﬂy on an airline that had a 13 per-
cent rate of not crashing?’ I was very
conﬁdent I was doing the right thing.
In the process, I discovered my mu-
tant superpower. I got to change the
future.”
Proceeds from the show will go to
Macmillan Cancer Support. Kate Ma-
cauley of Macmillan said, “One in three
of us will get cancer and it’s the tough-
est thing most of us will ever face. The
number of people with cancer is grow-
ing every day. This show tells a per-
sonal and positive story about the hard
choices women can face. We want to
reach and improve the lives of every
one of those people. Donations make
up 98% of our income, so we simply
couldn’t do what we do without you.”
