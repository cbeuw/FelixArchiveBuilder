Deciding what to do with ‘the rest
of your life’ after graduation can be
a daunting prospect. If you feel you
have become pigeon-holed with too
few opportunities available to you, or
that you are capable of doing anything
but don’t know how to choose which
road to take, then this article is for you
What follows should give you some
perspective and suggest some simple
steps towards getting a job after grad-
uation, moving on to further studies
or even doing something completely
diﬀerent.
Since leaving Imperial College Lon-
don with an MEng (Hons) and then
a PhD in Aeronautical Engineering, I
have worked as a self-employed Eng-
lish teacher in Spain, as an occasional
pianist and joined the Future Leaders
Development Programme at Barclays
in 2012 – see www.seemore-bemore.
com. Although being an undergradu-
ate and then a postgraduate feels like
quite a long time ago now, I remem-
ber worrying about what I would do in
the future. Sometimes it felt as though
there were so many possibilities that I
didn’t know which to choose, while on
other occasions it felt as though there
were very few roles for which I would
be suited.
In my opinion, the key for making
career choices is simple: identify the
skills you enjoy using, the strengths
you have and ﬁnd the ﬁelds that corre-
spond. Never forget that a high salary
will not necessarily make you happy
and that you are capable of choosing a
diﬀerent path to your friends.
When studying, it can be hard to
remember that your skill set is just as
important as your academic results.
You may ﬁnd that the set of skills you
will use in a full-time job are very dif-
ferent from those you used at univer-
sity: the prerequisites for academic
success can be very diﬀerent to the
prerequisites for success in business.
I adore my job, but doing it as well
as I can is not a question of being the
smartest person in the room or always
knowing how to solve a problem on
my own. It is a matter of knowing who
can solve it, what support they will
need to do it and how to get that sup-
port for them.
Once upon a time I was an academic
student doing Aeronautical Engineer-
ing, yet these days the most diﬃcult
mathematics I need on a daily basis
is addition and the only time I think
about aeroplanes is when I check in at
an airport. On the other hand, I now
use interpersonal skills that I never
learned in a lecture theatre, such as
building up a professional network,
knowing the skills of each person I
you know and developing the skills
to manage people. These diﬀerent
skills sets mean that it is important
that you try to balance your stud-
ies with extra-curricular activities if
that is where your strengths lie. Now
I know that captaining a sports team,
helping to organise a large university
event or running a society would have
developed skills far more valuable to
my current employer than a hundred
modules on helicopter dynamics.
For those of you graduating next
year, set aside a little time over the
summer and next year thinking about
your next steps. Don’t hesitate too
long to decide what jobs to apply for,
as sometimes you will learn more
about what you want to do during the
application process. If you ﬁnd your-
self lacking motivation to complete
an application form or disliking the
people you meet from the business,
it could be a sign that this path is not
for you.
Here are some suggestions to help
you get started:
1. Identify the skills that you enjoy
using and where your abilities lie. Are
you fascinated by solving theoreti-
cal problems or do you prefer ﬁxing
broken go-karts? Is analysing and re-
futing written arguments your thing
or are you much happier ad-libbing
your points on a stage in front of an
audience? If you need some help, ask
your friends and family for the things
that you do well. Be as clear as you
can about the skills you have and the
areas you want to develop. Don’t sell
yourself short or focus only on your
university studies: playing in a football
team regularly requires teamwork and
dedication, while organising univer-
sity events requires leadership and the
ability to prevent or solve last-minute
problems. Employers value these
skills, so let them know that you have
them.
2. Make use of the Careers Advisory
Service, the internet and any friends
who are already working to help you
map out which jobs use the skills you
have identiﬁed. Be clear on the skills
you want to use; sometimes it can also
help to be clear about the things that
you don’t want to do. Use any work
experience you have, from bar work to
summer internships, to feed into this.
3. Meet the people who work at the
companies and in the sectors that you
want to work in. Go to the Careers
Fair at Imperial (or elsewhere) and
speak to the people manning the stall.
Ask yourself, ‘Is that the kind of per-
son I would like to become’? Look for
‘meet and greet’ events for students,
networking evenings or industry
body events. Spending an hour or two
speaking with people who have been
working in your chosen industry for
years, hearing what they enjoy and
what they complain about too, can be
a real eye-opener.
4. Apply as early in the academic
year as you can, even if you are not
100% certain about your choices. The
longer you leave it, the harder it is to
get onto the most popular graduate
programmes or ﬁnd the best direct-
entry jobs. Speak to any friends you
have who are already working – some
companies even oﬀer a reward to em-
ployees who recommend a friend who
is oﬀered and accepts the job.
Try and spend as much time as you
reasonably can on this. It is your ﬁnal
year and you will be busy but, if you
reﬂect on your skills and career choice
to choose carefully and early, you will
reap the rewards. Remember too that
if in a few years’ time you decide that
you want to do something else (within
reason), you should be able to do that
fairly easily. The career choices that
you make now are not ﬁnal – right
now, you only have to make the best
choices with the information available
to you.
