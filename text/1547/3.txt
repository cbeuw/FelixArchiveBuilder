Students reminded: don’t bring
the College into disrepute

PETA complains to the Rector
over Queen’s Lawn petting zoo
PETA have written to the President &
Rector of Imperial College London urg-
ing him to stop the Union’s plans for a
petting zoo on Queen’s Lawn on Thurs-
day 23 May. The letter calls the petting
zoo “ill-conceived” and asks for Impe-
rial to “make a formal to avoiding future
events that promote the mistreatment of
animals”.
In the letter, addressed to Sir Keith
O’Nions (President & Rector), safety
to students and treatment of animals are
cited as reasons to stop the petting zoo,
which is part of the Union’s Stress Less
campaign.
The letter states “Experts indicate
that petting zoos are hotbeds of serious
pathogens, including E coli and salmo-
nella bacteria. The area surrounding
an animal’s cage can be teeming with
bacteria. According to the Health and
Safety Executive, infections can spread
through direct or even indirect animal
contact, and in some cases the illness
can be fatal.” The letter goes on to say
that anxious students during exam sea-
son would have “weakened immune sys-
tems” and therefore be at a greater risk
of infection, which PETA say means that
students “can develop bloody diarrhoea,
anaemia, chronic kidney failure or neu-
rological impairments such as seizures
and strokes”.
The letter also sighted cruelty to ani-
mals as a reason to stop the petting zoo,
saying that they “contribute to a cruel
cycle of breeding, abandonment and
killing”. It said “ Exhibitors take young
animals on the road and, if they survive
the stress of transport and handling, typi-
cally dispose of them when they become
more difficult to handle, replacing them
with new animals.” PETA also raised
concerns over the way that the animals
would be kept in general, saying that
they are kept in unnatural social and
family groups and that the habitats they
are kept in “inhibit or prevent natural be-
haviour”.
PETA say that “Imperial College Lon-
don would be setting a bad example for
others” if the planned petting zoo were
to go ahead; it suggests masseurs as a re-
placement, which the Union had in the
Library Café on Tuesday 14 May (also
as part of the Stress Less campaign).
PETAalso referenced a recent incident
at Oxford when the Principle of Somer-
ville College told students to cancel the
plans to have a live shark displayed in a
tank during their summer ball following
multiple complaints from students and
former students.
There is even reference to the can-
celled plans Somerville College, Oxford
Imperial College Union are not the
only student union around the UK to
host a petting zoo. Leeds and Southamp-
ton are two student unions that have also
brought a petting zoo to students during
exam time to relieve stress.
Felix contacted the Union who replied
with the following statement: “The Col-
lege have been involved from the outset
in the planning of the Union’s campaign,
and permission had been sought from
the relevant persons. Animal welfare has
also been at the forefront of our planning
from the start. We chose our provider,
Pets4Ponies, upon the recommendation
of the LSE Students’ Union, who were
satisfied with the safety and welfare of
the animals when they first held a pet-
ting zoo this time last year. The providers
have all of the relevant DEFRA paper-
work, insurance and risk assessments.
We are looking forward to seeing lots of
students enjoying the petting zoo.”
The letter was sent from PETA UK,
which is an affiliate of PETA US. PETA
are known for running high profile cam-
paigns with celebrities against people
wearing fur.

may be damaging to the reputation of
the individual posting, the individual
being post about [sic] and to the repu-
tation of Imperial College London.”
A link to the College’s social media
guidelines was included.
The social media guidelines is for
those who are “ thinking about rep-
resenting the College on social media
platforms” and explicitly say what is
not allowed. This includes abuse of pri-
vacy, spam, rude or defamatory behav-
iour, oﬀensive or libellous comments.
Felix contacted College and pro-
vided the evidence of the post. At time
of going to print, there has been no
response.
Imperial Memes was set up last year
by a student at Imperial, although
there hasn’t been much activity recent-
ly. It does raise questions about what
other pages are known by students.
Felix were once contacted about the
cover photo of one such page.
