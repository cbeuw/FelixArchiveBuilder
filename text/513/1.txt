Sabbatical Results j
Chris Fox will be President of Imperial College Union next I
year following a heavy poll in this week's sabbatical elections. I
In the election, which was ratified by elections committee on
Wednesday, he emerged victorious by a 2:1 m a r g i n over his s
m a i n opponent Sheyne Lucock.
Chris Fox is a 3rd year Chemistry undergraduate and
currently President of the Royal College of Science Union. H i s
m a i n campaign platform was " a balanced union".
Although he stood as a non political candidate and has not been
involved in Party politics at IC, he had in fact been C h a i r m a n of I
Hereford North Y o u n g Liberals in 1974 before coming to College.
Roger Stotesbury was the clear winner in the election for Honorary {
Secretary. A physics 2nd year student, he has been a very active I C U \
Academic Affairs Oificer this year and is editor of the Alternative S
Prospectus.
