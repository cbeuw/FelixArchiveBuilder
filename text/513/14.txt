DEBATING SOCIETY
"This House Believes that Scientists and Technologists should
be able to Communicate More Effectively"
The audience at the most recent Debsoc Event were entertained (and
informed?) by the varied and diverse talents of:- Sonia Hochfelder,
Duncan Suss and Barney Mc Cabe, and Roger Stotesbury, Clive
Hamilton and Mark Smith. The first three succeeded in getting the
motion passed, by a margin of a single vote!
Sonia suggested that voting against her would indicate her inability to
communicate and should be counted as a vote for the motion, while
Roger Stotesbury deviously suggested "other people" should be used
to do the communicating. There was much 'Thrust and Parry' between
Clive, Barney and Mark, but the star of the day (whose razor-sharp
verbal attacks and madras-hot scorn reminded Debsoc veterans ofthe
Halcyon Days of the Mines Inter-CCU Debating Champions) was
Duncan Suss, who gleefully extolled the virtues of 'Rat-Tongue' (A
national language which he proposed as a panacea for all international
technical communications breakdowns).
John Shuttleworth (Acting Chairman) called for questions (the bulk
of which emanated from a certain Debsoc Chairman posing as a
doorman/money changer). A good ego-trip was had by all.
P.S. Watch-out for us at the Rag Fete (for clues, see the Chairman of
the permanent working party - Cragham Ox (A-ragman) )

This article is to bring to your
attention that this college has a
film society and to ask for
consumer help and cooperation!
Film society is going to order its
films for next year in the near
future so your participation in the
following scheme is for your own
benefit.
I would likeydu to send me your
choice of five films you would like
to see next year, in order of
preference.
From these suggestions I will be
able to ensure the majority of
people get the opportunity to get
the right films for their own, and
the Union's money!
Just shake a leg or better still
pick up a pen and contact me
through the internal mail to
ensure your entertainment can
really be entertaining next year.
Please send suggestions to: -
