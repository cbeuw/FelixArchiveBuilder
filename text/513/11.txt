O u r mission: T o boldly go where no
one had gone before, to seek out new
styles and to witness the m u s i c evolving
f r o m Ulster. A n d so it came to pass that
we ventured northwards to the land of
C a m d e n to the Electric Ballroom. Star
date - Saturday night. Captain's log;
Everyone was talking about it, " T h e
R o u g h T r a d e Package" a collection of
new interesting bands organized by
Kensington's alternative record label
R o u g h Trade.
Unfortunately everyone else had the
same idea and the r o o m was densely
packed with all shapes, colours and
sizes.
First on was Robert Rental and the
N o r m a l a wierd electronic duo. The noises
they managed to produce were strong,
r y t h m i c , p o w e r f u l , m o n o t o n o u s a n d
ultimately enjoyable.
That was the good news now the bad news,
the music between the acts. W h y should it be
common practice to play unending reggae
over and over again at such events? One or
two tracks maybe, but not all night! I suppose
though it does make you appreciate the real
music when the bands come on.
Next came Essential Logic led by their
vocalist and saxophonist L o r a Logic. Lora's
previous claim to fame was with X - R a y Spex
two years ago and she's only eighteen now. I
saw the group a couple of months ago when
they had just been formed and were nervous,
and troubled, but obviously talented..
Tonight they were bursting with confidence
and still troubled with the sound but the
talent was still there. Watch out for their
impending single " W a k e U p " a sure fire hit,
and if you haven't got Miss Logic's minor cult
hit, Aerosol Burns yet, why not?
M o r e reggae and then for a change some I
reggae.
T h e n cheers and enter stage right Belfast's
answer to the Brotherhood of M a n , Stiff
Little Fingers Agreed they're not as well
known yet but its only a matter of time and as
a consolation the music's a bit better. S . L . F .
play straight forward fast punk music with a
message; the situation in Ulster isn't perfect
but fighting won't solve anything. W h o can
argue with that, certainly no one at the
Electric Ballroom. Anyone wishing to lose
some weight should spend an evening there,
and j o i n in the mindless pogoing at the front.
Never were so many calories lost by so few soj
quickly. Tracks from the new album
Inflammable M a t e r i a l came thick and fast,
all were exhillarating, especially the singles
Suspect Device and Alternative Ulster. But
when the music is so fast so is the passage of
time and soon came the end of the set. But
there was no way that was the end of the
night's activites.
They returned to encore with 'Rough
Trade' a tirade against the established music /
business and finally the line up was added to
with a guest guitarist from the T . R . B . , a stiff
little thumb. They ended with a true punk
anthem the Clash's White Riot and everyone
went wild.
T h e n it was over we returned to the
Enterprise hot and tired and gave Sunday
m o r n i n g a miss. ,
Over .and out. !

T . E . Lawrence " T h e M i n t "
(Penguin 95 p 232 pages)
T . E . Lawrence entered the Royal A i r
Force depot at Uxbridge in mid-August
1922, under the assumed name John
H u m e Ross.
Previous to this, he had been at the
Colonial Office as Adviser to Winston
Churchill on Middle Eastern Affairs,
following his work with the A r a b s
during the A r a b Revolt, and the
c r e a t i o n of the A r a b States. A
distinguished career at the Foreign
Office was assured, but he left to revise
his account of the A r a b Revolt, "Seven
Pillars of W i s d o m " , and to enter the
ranks of the R.A.F.
W h e n he took his medical, he was aged 34,
and in an emaciated and depressed state. H e
had been wounded seven times in Arabia,
and was exhausted by his rewriting of "Seven
Pillars of W i s d o m " . It was only by calling on
the influence of his friend, Sir H u g h
Trenchard, the Chief of A i r Staff, that he
managed to get in at all.
The first part of " T h e M i n t " describes his
experiences during his basic training at
Uxbridge. This part of the book was written
from notes made at the time, and describes
his day to day existence with unerring
accuracy, including the full brunt of barrack-
room language. The physical hardship and
degradation are described in a hard, precise
manner, or as Lawrence described his work
"an iron, rectangular abhorrent book".
In J a n u a r y 1923, L a w r e n c e was
discharged because the press discovered his
REVIEW - British Rail's Streamlined, Nuclear,
Subsonic, stopping at all stations and some
in between, train for advanced passengers.
This Friday I had my first adventure (non-
erotic) on board" a Dueiug 707 British Rail
blue and yellow train. (The one that's pointed
at both ends). With great excitement I strode
down platform 6 at Kings Cross - realized my
mistake, and went to platform 4 where the
train was. Having first walked the length of
the wondrous train, I boarded the carriage
that had the most young, pretty girls on.
I knew full well that none of them would be
able to resist my charms - especially when I
pulled my FELIX proudly from my battered,
broken rucksack. So I sat back, languishing>
in the comfort of blue BR upholstery, and"
peering over the top of my FELIX to catch the
eye of the girl in the corner, (I threw it back),!
winked at her in my most seductive manner.
My eyes flashed from the toilet behind her to
her eyes and back, hoping she would get my
message (I spent my youth reading
unprintable mucky books). I must have been
successful because she promptly fell asleep
for the rest of the journey!
Bored, I looked out of the window - we'd
stopped in Hitchin - marvellous - only we
weren't supposed to stop there. I think the
driver had gone for a pee. Have you ever
stopped to consider how the driver manages
when he's driving at 120 m.p.h. down the
straight, and suddently gets an uncontrolable
urge. He can't go out the window - so he stops
at the next convenient station (urrggh).

real identity, and entered the T a n k Corps.
However, after veiled suicide threats, he re-
entered the R . A . F . in August 1925, and
served at Cranwell Cadet College until
M a r c h , 1927. H e was then transferred to
India, just as "Seven Pillars of W i s d o m " was
being published.
The second, much shorter, part ofthe book
describes his time at Cranwell. The writing
flows in a lighter, more fluent way, reflecting
the m u c h better c o n d i t i o n s at this
establishment.
This part of the book may reflect
Lawrence's loyalty to the R . A . F . , and some
critics found it detracted from the power of
the earlier part ofthe book. Personally, I did
not find this so.
" T h e M i n t " is one of Lawrence's major
works, not only being an account of the
conditions in the R . A . F . , but also providing
an insight into the reasons why Lawrence
entered the airlorce. Some of them
were certainly tied up with his wish to write a
book on R . A . F . life from the bottom, a task
cut short by the press. It was also a search for
contentment after self-doubt about his
achievements in the M i d d l e East, and the
quality of "Seven Pillars of W i s d o m " . H e
found this contentment in the services, and it
was not until he left them that he fell again
into deep depression, and was killed in a
motor cycle accident in 1935.
" T h e M i n t " remains the window into the
life of one of the most colourful men of this
century.

That's how most BR timetables operate. They
estimate the time it takes for a driver to want
9° f o
_r a
Pe
e, work out the average speed of
the train, and find a major station for the train
to stop at, at that particular distance. Only
when the Keg in the engine is Watneys, and
not the usual Theakstons, the drivers have to
stop more frequently - hence delays and
stopping at non-scheduled stations.
After a while they turned up the heat in the
carriage so more people would buy cold
drinks, so I toddled off to the buffet. Shock-
horror-surprise- the Buffet served hot meals,
Keg beer, and little bottles of tonic water, and
there were actually 5 people behind the
counter to serve. This illusion was shattered
when only one man did the serving, and the
other 4 watched him, offering helpful
suggestions.
The thing that impressed me most, though,
was the PA system. After we had pulled out of
Kings Cross the PA went, "Crackle-Crackle-
Dis ab de Chief steward on dees train, de
buffay car am open." At least I think that's
what it said ' cos the "crackle-crackle"
continued until the thing was switched off,
I must say that it was the most pleasant trip I
have had on any train all over the world (well-
the best BR ride I've had).
Remember BR makes sense - I don't.
