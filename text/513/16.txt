THIRDS FIELD A FULL TEAM!
I.C. ill 2 vs U.C. II 1
Saturday 10th March
The previous two matches saw the thirds lose to L.S.E. with 9 men,
and miss the Harlington coach to play Bedford II with 7 men. T h e
uninformed reader might think of this as a disaster, but I can exclusively
reveal that this was yet another deliberate ploy of that tactical genius,
player-manager Dave Hall.
While championship contenders U.C. II were confidently expecting
victory over an 8-men team or a walk-over, Dave Hall revealed his
masterplan: -
He put 11 names on the team-sheet, and booked transport to
Harlington!
Lo and behold, on Saturday
morning, 11 sober players and a
coach were at the Union. This was
obviously beyond skipper Hall's
wildest dreams, as he had only
brought 9 red shirts! Despite this
minor setback the team boarded
the right coach and arrived at
Harlington.
G i l e s B r e r e t o n , w h o i s
invariably still putting hisbootson
while the team kicks off, was first
changed, and soon the new-look
11-man version of I.C. Ill took to
the pitch. The back three became
the back four; the forward line
tripled in number and the goalie
had actually played in goal before!
A hard game followed with
furious attacking football from
both sides. Without Neil Price to
moan at, second-teamers Chris
Beer and Phil Niccolls found it
hard to adjust to playing in this all-
action outfit. They must however
be given special credit for lasting
the full 90 minutes, in a class of
football to which they are
unaccustomed. U.C. took an early
lead, when our keeper, from Aero
II, m i s c a l c u l a t e d t h e Mach
number and projected elevation
of a hopeful long shot. Alan
Donaldson equalised with a
beautifully worked goal, and Dave
McPhail got the winner in the
dying seconds.
At full time, U . C . were still
counting the number of players
we had, and regretting they had
u n d e r e s t i m a t e d D a v e H a l l ' s
tactical genius.
Team: - Al Betts, Cyril Knowles,
Chris Beer, Giles Brereton, Dave
Hall, Adrian Clarke, Phil Niccolis.

I.C. VTH 8:0 BIRKBECK III
When the ageing and rapidly tiring Paddy O'Kelly was taken
off at half-time and replaced by Stu Dillon the Fifth's came
dramatically to life.
Up to half-time the Fifth's had looked surprisingly subdued
and had only two goals to show for all their efforts. These both
came from headers following Paddy O'Kelly crosses: the first
being a fine bullet header from 'Big Headed' Barrie Hatton, and
the second yet another 'vital' goal from Phil Lakin.
In the second half IC took
complete control of the game
and Damion Kelly and Denis
C o o k w e r e p a r t i c u l a r l y
outstanding, dominating the
midfield and running off the
ball and supporting collea-
gues regularly. In defence I.C.
never looked in any trouble
with P h i l L a k i n a n d A l
'Betjemin' C a b l e d e a l i n g
admirably with a very 'speedy'
and skilful Birkbeck centre-
forward. Both I.C. full backs
Steve Kaye and Bob Dhillon
were so starved of opposition
that they spent practically the
whole of the half overlapping-
ing in the Birkbeck half. This
considerably helped J o h n
Shuttleworth and Stu Dillon
I.C.'s two wingers who were
c o n s i s t e n t l y b e a t i n g the
B i r k b e c k f u l l - b a c k s a n d
a i m i n g a s u c c e s s i o n of
crosses at Barrie Hatton's
head. This proved to be such a
large target that they rarely
missed. In fact this proved so
successful that several times
(5) the ball actually bounced
of Barrie's head into the net.
Though it is worth noting that
the one time Stu Dillon missed
the target he scored.
It must be pointed out
however that Birkbeck were
such a poor side that not only
did Steve 'Dracula' Veats have
nothing to do ( and thereby
keep a clean sheet) but also
Clive Whiteside was at times
made to look like a footballar.
Team: S. Veats, B. Dhillon, S.
Kaye, A I, Cable (Capt), P.
Lakin, D. Kelly. D. Cook, C.

U C IV I, I.C. IV 7
With a sudden, i f unexpected, return to f o r m the IVth's
continued their astonishing run-in to possible league honours
with a crushing 7-1 victory away to U.C. Although informed
sources fear they m a y have left it too late, the confidence in the
c a m p is sky-high a n d with three crucial games remaining, it
takes a brave m a n to bet against them.
Fresh from their record breaking 24-0 win against Q . E . C . , I.C. were
eager and hungry to avenge a defect earlfer in the season by U . C . and
with the hot springsunshine on their backs, set about the task in earnest.
Being a midweek match meant there were less hangovers than usual
and this was soon made evident by the fact that over half their passes
actually found another I.C. player, with debut starlet M i l l a r finding
O ' K e l l y (not an easy task) with a series of good balls down the left Hank.
Although U . C . battled gamely, unchallenged through the home
incessant I.C. pressure had to tell
and when the first goal came, it
was stunning in its implicit)'.
M a r t y n pounced on a loose ball in
midfieid and slipped it to M i l l a r
who again sent O ' K e l l y away
down the left; a hard cross found
Rowley on the spot, a n d " D e r
B o m b e r " made no mistake from
ten yards.
A t this stage U . C . made a brief
attempt to get back in the game
but Wilson easily dealt with their
one player of any skill, a n d as
normal Caffyn, Smith, a n d the
general, L a k i n were more than a
match for anyone else who came
through. I.C. soon regained
control and good work by Rake
on the right set up the second goal
when, after beating two men he
put M a r t y n through, who then
left Rowley with a formality.
N o w U . C . heads began to drop
and this was the signal for I.C. to
step up the pace even more, as
they displayed the ruthless, killer-
instinct which is now such a
feature of their game. Large and
looming gaps were opening up
everywhere in the U . C . defence
and a good run by Shuttleworth
down the right provided Rowley
with a chance to entertain
everyone with a ten second ball
juggling act before being able to
control the ball and slot it past a
bemused, applauding 'keeper, for
his hat-trick.
This was shortly followed by
more dazzling footwork by
O ' K e l l y on the left, who, when he
actually received the ball, split
the defence to give M a r t y n a
simple tap in. M o r e I r i s h
wizardry saw h i m personally
score a few minutes later, and in
the dying seconds Rowley,
obviously bored as he walked
defence, played a one-two with
the left-hand post before lashing
in his fourth.
At the hall-time change round,
O ' K e l l y didn't a n d thus played
the second hall on the right,
although he says it was a move to
confuse their defence. In fact the
second half was very much a n
anti-climax, with I.C.'s approach
becoming very lethargic. This
wasn't aided much by the fact
that on the odd occasion they did
produce something positive, there
were so many IVth's forwards in
the box anxious to cash in on the
goal bonanza that invariably they
blocked each others' shots.
This rather wasteful play had
its inevitable result when the
defence, well up to bolster the
flagging attack, were caught a bit
by one of the isolated U . C . breaks
which ended when one of their
relatively obscure players, " n u t -
megged" three of ours, including
Witts in goal (who otherwise had
a magnificent matcfO for a token
reply.
I.C. were rocked, but soon
regained some composure and a
bit more urgency was rewarded
when Rowley hit his fifth from a
corner, after Shuttleworth h a d
gone close, to once more regain a
saler. six goal breathing space. In
fact in the last lew minutes I.C.
raised their game considerably
and could have had a couple more
but the second half was best
epitomized by the last incident of
the game, when O ' K e l l y found
himself clear a n d trying to
emulate Rowley played the ball
off the post again - only this time it
bounced off for a goal kick.
Team: Witts, Wilson, Lakin. Smith,
Caffyn, Millar, Martyn. Rake,
Shitllleiiorth, Rowley, O'Kelly.
