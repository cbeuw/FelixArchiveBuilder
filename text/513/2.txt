P a g e 2
Dear Sir, -1 am writing in reply to
the letters, in last week's F E L I X ,
by Raouf Zaidan, Tony Gox and
J a n K o o l . I will only attempt to
answer the argument' which
appears to be common in all
three.
Tony C o x and J a n K o o l i both
questioned why I should believe
the Bible's ruling on homosexual-
ity, when at the same time I
probably didn't believe other
parts oi' the Bible, such as
Creation in seven days. This
argument, though it appears to be
valid, fails, because I do believe
the world was created in six days
(I believe all the Bible or none of
it). I am not the only Christian, or
civil engineer, who believes this.
U.S. President Jimmy Carter also
believes in Creation in six days, so
does Dr. Henry Morris, who for
many years was H e a d of the C i v i l
Engineering Dept. at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute. (Henry
Morris is now Director of the
Creation Research Center in San
Diego, California. H e once said
that "to interpret the Bible literally is
simple to take God at his word.")
Absolute standards, such as a
' B i b l e ' , are also used i n
engineering. F o r example, in
concrete design all engineers must
work according to the Code of
Practice, C P 1 1 0 (a set of rules and
guidelines). T h e m e n w h o
instituted C P 1 1 0 are experts in
their field, the engineers who
design according to it often aren't.
If an engineer designs a structure
which fails; and if his design
contradicted C P U O , then he is
liable. In effect C P 1 1 0 is treated
as absolute - even with authors
who are fallible and a code which
can be altered. (One lecturer
actually refers to C P 1 1 0 as,'the
Bible'). Similarly the M o r a l Laws
c o n t a i n e d i n E x o d u s a n d
Leviticus are a 'Code of Practice'.
The bold statements and clear
guidelines laid out in C P 1 1 0 are
to be obeyed - not interpreted:
likewise with the statements on
M o r a l Laws in the Bible. Unlike
CP110 the Bible does not change
and its A u t h o r is not fallible.
The Bible's main purpose is in
fact, not a 'Code of Practice', but
rather God's communication, or
testament, to all mankind. G o d
created man and the world
perfect. The Creation only
became imperfect as a result of
man's sin, whereupon death
entered into the world. Because
G o d loves everyone of us and does
not want anyone to go to Hell, he
sent his only Son Jesus Christ to
die for our sins, so that whosoever
believes in H i m will have
everlasting life (in Heaven). This
is what Christianity is all about:
the message of the Bible from
beginning to end. The Laws, or
'Codes of Practice', are only a
part of it.
I believe that homosexuality is
wrong, principally, because of
what The Bible says. In addition
m y c o n s c i e n c e a n d m y
observation of the design of the
human body confirm this belief. II
one rejects the Bible and the
'conscience' argument as not
being reasonable, then I am left
with the design of the human
body; but this requires a belief in
Creation, so that it too comes
from the Bible. Thus in reply to
Tony Cox's challenge, for a
reason why homosexuality is
wrong without referring to the
Bible, I can only say that I have
no other reason - only the
Bible.
Yours faithfully.

Dear Sir, - Although this
c o r r e s p o n d e n c e has b e e n
continuing for some time and few
new points appear to have been
raised on the subject of abortion, I
felt I must reply to the letters
raised by Sean K e l l y and Barry
Austin in F E L I X last week.
I respect the view prolferred by
both of them, although I do not
agree with it, that life begins from
the moment of conception.
However there is a point I must
stress that this is simply a point of
view and can be nothing more.
The British M e d i c a l Association
have been totally unable to define
life, and I really fail to see why
either of them appear to be so
much better informed about these
matters than this highly qualified
and well-established institution.
If the ultimate aim of these
anti-abortionists is to make
abortion illegal then an opinion of
a section of the community is
being imposed on all women
whether they agree with it or not.
If free abortion on demand were
available in this country, no-one
could force a woman to abort her
child, that decision would be left
entirely to her opinion on the
subject and not M r . Austin's and
M r . Kelly's. Surely this is
consistent with the democratic
society in which we live.
Even if abortion were made
illegal, there would be no way of
eliminating it completely, the
alternative being intolerable to
too many women. Those women
who could afford it would look
outside Britain and those who
couldn't, fthe vast majority of
British women), would be driven
to back street abortions. Surely
Barry Austin is not advocating a
return to a high incidence of
septic abortions which would be a
direct result of a change in British
law as it stands.
I was horrified to hear Sean
Kelly say that a woman who
conceived a child alter rape
should not be allowed an
abortion. Barry Austin totally
disregarded the issue by saying
'conception from rape is extremely rare,
and rape isn't too common either'. The
fact that conception from rape is
fairly uncommon would not help
alleviate the mental anguish a
woman in this situation would be
forced to undergo by these two
gentlemen. As rape at this college
alone occurs at the rate of three to
four a year and nationwide
statistics . are increasing all the
time, the situation may not be so
far removed from their lives as
they seem to think.
As neither of them will ever
undergo the experience of rape or
unwanted pregnancy themselves,
I merely presume neither of them
h a v e g i v e n t h o u g h t a n d
consideration towards the woman
involved in either of these
dilemmas. M r . Austin even
appears to be saying no matter
how good a person's reasons are
she should not be allowed to
terminate her pregnancy. Is he
really suggesting that no abortion
should take place even if
considered m e d i c a l o p i n i o n
agrees that the child would be
born abnormal or that in giving
birth the mother may die? O r is
there no end to the atrocities the
P A T A would like to see carried
out.
I would like to suggest that
Barry Austin should restrain
h i m s e l f from r a m m i n g his
opinions down other peoples
throats, and from attempting to
legally enforce his point of view on
all women.

Eds note - correspondence on this topic
is now closed.
Dear Sir, - I will not say that I
was 'ashamed to be a member of
this U n i o n ' when the quorum of
the last U n i o n General Meeting
was challenged by our President,
but I very much felt that
democracy had been under-
mined.
I have the highest respect and
regard for M a r y ' s political and
ideological opinions, and for the
determined and active way in
which she pursues her belief's.
Nevertheless, some points need to
be made as regards the conduct of
U . G . M . ' s with respect to a
challenge to the quorum.
The purpose of a quorum at a
meeting is to ensure that no
decision is made by a group of
people that is not reasonably
representative. Most Imperial
College U n i o n General Meetings
are capable of producing a fairly
representative d e c i s i o n . N o
m e e t i n g c a n be t o t a l l y
representative but unless we have
a certain amount of 'licence' on
the quorae.y ol meetings Imperial
College U n i o n would never reach
any sort of constructive decision.
I think it was fairly clear that
the last U . G M . felt that College
should not be put in awkward
positions over job interviews, as it
was in the incident concerning
Roberts Construction. H a v i n g
said this I disapprove, and I
certainly believe the meeting
disapproved, of the situation in
South Africa, but it is a
fundamental principle of our
society that an individual is
perfectly entitled to come to his
own decision on such matters.
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e C a r e e r s
Service is undoubtedly one of the
best in the country but if we
continue to abuse it consequences
to I.C. students, arising from the
loss of respect for the service,
could be serious. The motion put
to the U . G . M . said nothing about
South Africa, it merely recognised
personal freedom of opinion and
opposed the abuse of the Careers
Service.
Whatever the pros and cons oi
the motion, lor a U n i o n President
to challenge the quoracy of a
meeting that was fairly close to
the 300 mark, and consequently
as near quorate as we are likely to
get, was w r o n g . It was
particularly wrong when at a
previous U . G . M . , the quorum
h a v i n g b e e n s u c c e s s f u l l y
challenged, M a r y referred to
certain U n i o n members as
'bastards', and when the motion
being discussed was particularly
supported by those students
whom it would most directly
affect. Namely students of the
R o y a l School of Mines.
I am disappointed in M a r y ' s
attitude. W e elected a President
who stood for 'democracy and
action'. She certainly stands for
action but does she stand for
democracy?
Yours,
T o n y Cox

Dear John, - Unaccustomed as I
am to public writing, I now feel
that the action taken by our
beloved? I C U President at the last
I C U G M demands a few words.
Firstly, for those not present a
few facts. After the hustings were
over the agenda was changed to
allow discussion of the motion on
'job recruitment' - a motion
which has great importance over
career prospects lor final year
students. It was unfortunate, in
my opinion, that discussion of the
m o t i o n as f a r as M i s s
Attenborough was concerned
took on a bitter flavour in the
form of a double barreled attack
on South Africa and not the
motion on the floor.
This far from radical motion,
basically protecting rights of
individual students to freedom of
choice about future employment
resulted from the recent - (what
can only be called) - balls-up
regarding Roberts Construction
Ltd. the affects of which are still
being felt by I.C. interviewees.
The motion on job recruitment
was being discussed in a rational
(if not slightly tepid) manner
when M a r y (may G o d protect her
soul) decided to call quorum. This
