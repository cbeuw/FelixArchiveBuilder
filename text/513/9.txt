This week's story involves scholarships. We entered the
controversy about scholarships at the Board of Studies
meeting held on the 18th October, 1978. At the meeting some
new scholarship arrangements were recommended.
There arc currently 35 scholarships available lor award on the results
ol the College scholarship examination held in January each year. 10 ol
these scholarships are available for three years at the value of £75 per
annum. T h e remaining 25 scholarships, also valued at £75 are available
for only one year. In addition there are 55 Imperial College scholarships
awarded on the results of the first year examinations, such scholars
receive £75 per a n n u m in the second and third year of their course. T h e
proposal put to Board of Studies would, however, increase these
scholarships quite considerably, to five scholarships at £500 per a n n u m
for the duration of an undergraduate course and 25 scholarships at £250
per annum for the duration of an undergraduate course. There is also a
proposal to put the first year scholarships up to £100 each, to be
awarded for the final two years.
T h e new proposals would cost
about £20,000 per year more than
the existing arrangement. It was
for this reason that a U n i o n
General M e e t i n g passed policy
against the new proposals
pointing out that if scholarships
were to be given to anybody they
would be better given to people
who had no means of support and
be of a level able to keep them
through a course. In the case of
undergraduates this would, of
course, be overseas students. We
objected also to the idea of using
monetary incentive to people who
it was not necessarily known to be
in financial difficulties in order to
bring them to the College.
College should be able to attract
students on the basis of its
academic reputation.
It was this objection to the new-
scheme that led us to 170 Queen's
Gate last Wednesday, 7th M a r c h ,
in order to chat with six members
of the academic stall plus the
Rector. W h e n I say we. I mean
myself, (not surprisingly), Roger
Stotesbury, Academic Allairs
Officcri Bob Hart, C and G U
Academic Allairs Officer, Steve
Ruane, R C S U Academic Affairs
Officer, Peter Bamlord, standing
in for Mines Academic Affairs
Officer, and M i k e the Elk. We
argued vociferously, with the
exception of the Mines Rep. that
if such money was available it
would be better put to other
purposes either as suggested in the
U G M motion to lull-support
scholarships for overseas students,
or to other projects which would
benefit the whole student body.
The main example of the need for
finance quoted was the need for
more student housing. £20,000
could finance a long-term lease on
two-thirds of a student house per
year. W e also pointed out that
there were obvious benefits in
having more housing in that
accommodation was the major
thing that put people off coming
to L o n d o n and that they could
produce no evidence to show the
scholarships made any overall
difference to the standard of
student life in the College. The
staff representatives a r g u e d ,
however, that the odd scholar in a
class added a great deal to the
quality of student discussion in a
class and argued that they did not
need to prove this but that we, on
the contrary, should prove that
other ways of spending finance,
e.g. student housing, would be of
much greater benefit.
In general the meeting only
maintained the status quo.
neither side convincing the other.
It looks like the proposals will
therefore come into effect quite
soon. It was at the end of the
meeting that we learned the latest
shock horror story about overseas
students and the directive from
the University- Grants Committee
to cut down numbers by 7% from
the 75/76 level. That hardly
made our evening!
Well, you've missed all the
U G M ' s for this term but if you're
really keen you can still observe
the last Council meeting of the
term being held on the 19th

Morgan-Grampian is one of the UK's
fastest growing companies in technical
and professional publishing.
We need qualified people to go out
into industry to find out and write
about what is happening in all areas
of technology: to interpret deve-
lopments for specialised readers.
Technical journalism can offer you a
rewarding way of using all your
engineering knowledge and of keeping
in touch with the forefront of tech-
nology. It is not just a desk job, it will
mean travelling in Britain, and perhaps
in Europe or even beyond.
Every year we employ a number of
engineering graduates for our Journa-
lism Training Scheme. We're not
looking for a ready developed, finely
honed prose style.
If you have a sound knowledge of
engineering and a basic ability to
put words together grammatically we
can teach you to be a good technical
journalist.
