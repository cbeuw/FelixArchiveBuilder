Clean & Wholesome
Well I certainly got some good
reactions from last week's article -
they ranged from thinking it was
one of my best efforts yet to
somebody who thought I needed
to see a psychiatrist ( me - a
pervert!). Then Roger Stotesbury.
who thinks they're boring - the
articles he'll write if elected
should be a good thing; but then
again he did say at the beginning
of the year "/ thought I was
heterosexual until I met Mike
Elkin". Well enough of this - I'll
just say I'm really a good clean
living young boy who's been
corrupted by the power of my
position (position?).
Social Colours
As the colours committee is not
meeting until next term to
consider all the nominations I
have decided to extend the
deadline to the last day of term i.e.
Friday March 23rd. Remember;
any union member can nominate
anybody for absolutely anything.

Well by the time you read this all
the elections for this term should
be over, probably leaving me a
nervous wreck. Please do
complain about them though, I'm
sure there must be some
procedure I've followed you can
moan about. Elections are not
dead and buried yet though. Next
term we have to elect the
Permanent Working Party
amongst others, which takes
place at the first UGM of next
term. (Actually there are only
two).
Well that's all for this week.
What a clean and wholesome
article this is. What a clean and
wholesome boy I am!

Teams, game all.
West deals and opens 1 H .
North overcalls 2 D . East, with
good Heart support, forces at least
to game with 2S. N o w South
makes an advance sacrifice of 6 D
but West boldly bids 7S. East
plays off A a n d K of Spades a n d so
the contract is 55%.

East deals and passes and West
opens 1C rebidding 2 N over
East's response of IS. 4 C was an
excellent bid by East, and West,
who happened to be none other
than K a r v e r himself, bids 6 C .
K i n g of Hearts is led but after
winning with the Ace, K a r v e r
leads small to the Ace of Clubs
missing the safety play o f l e a d i n g
Queen of Clubs. W i t h Clubs
breaking 4-0 on his left K a r v e r
goes one off to score - 100 instead
of+1370.
WATCH OUT for a DEBSOC debate on TUESDAY next in MATHS 340 at 1.00pm with
genuine GUEST SPEAKERS (we hope). THIS HOUSE BELIEVES THAT TWENTIETH
CENTURY MAN NEEDS RELIGION. Don't miss it.
