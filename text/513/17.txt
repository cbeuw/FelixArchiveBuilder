S c i e n c e U n i o n R e s u l t s
Meeting was held last Friday -
but there were no results.
M i c k Maghar, Returning
Officer for the elections for
the top R C S U posts, had
forgotten about the meeting
and was asleep in his Evelyn
Gardens r o o m .
But the worthy m e m b e r s of
R C S U remained undaunted
by this m i n o r m i s h a p and
p r o c e e d e d to r a t i f y the
inquorate election neverthe-
less. A n objection that one of
the ballot boxes was open
during polling and the others
had had their keys attached
was speedily dismissed.

victor in the Presidential election.

Before the elections M a r k
Corrigan told the meeting that
Guilds may not be able to take
part in this year's L o r d Mayor's
Show because they have not been
allowed free entry. However if
/'800 can be raised by industrial
sponsorship then there will still be
a chance of Guilds taking part.
Ironically Mines have been
invited to enter the Show and.
thev will be sponsored.

The final step towards a
Sabbatical Deputy president was
taken last week when an IC Union
Meeting gave a second reading to
the required Union byelaw
changes.
Despite several questions
regarding the financing of the
post the proposal was passed
without opposition.
Methods of raising the money
include the setting up of a
discount scheme and increased
income from pinball machines.
The meeting also accepted the
new job description for the
Deputy President which includes
the job of Junior Treasurer.
The meeting, in which the main
item on the agenda was the
sabbatical election hustings, also
discussed a controversial motion
on job recruitment, which ended
in U n i o n P r e s i d e n t M a r y
A t t e n b o r o u g h s u c c e s s f u l l y
challenging the quorum.
The motion proposed by Mark
Clegg referred to a recruitment
visit to College by the South
A f r i c a n c o m p a n y R o b e r t s
Construction and sought to limit
future action by the Union against
any company interviewing at
College.
Two amendments to the motion
were defeated. The first, by Paul
Fairbairn Editor of F O R W A R D ! ,
asked the Union to press College
not to invite companies recruiting
for South African jobs because of
discrimination against the 25 per
cent of coloured IC students.
T h e s e c o n d a m e n d m e n t
proposed by Mary Attenborough
called for a peaceful picket of
interviews by South African
companies.
She said that she would not
normally challenge the quorum
simply because she disagreed
with a motion. But in this case she
felt that there were many difficult
questions involved which had not
been fully discussed. To actively
encourage any company of any
nature to recruit in College was a
very sweeping statement and too
serious a decision to be taken at
an inquorate meeting.
The motion was due to be
discussed again at yesterday's
Union meeting.
