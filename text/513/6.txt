and J o h n " D r u i d " Lavis were

the o r i g i n a l d e a d l i n e fori

writing a row about arrange-
ments lor the hustings puts the

Misuse of C o m p u t e r
A Physics undergraduate has
b e e n l i n e d a n d f o r m a l l y
reprimanded alter he was caught
p o a c h i n g o t h e r p e o p l e ' s
computer user numbers.
But this has not proved
sufficient deterrent so far and the
unauthroised use of computer
numbers has continued. It is not
known who the current offender
is.
T h e latest victim of the
poacher's attentions was F E L I X
News E d i t o r Sonia Hoehfelder._
She noticed several occasions last
week when her number had been
used without her knowledge a n d
was forced to change her
password.
The College considers this a
very serious offence as it interferes
with other people's work and can
corrupt their computer files.
Students caught in the past have
suffered temporary rustication
(suspension from College).
Anyone suspecting that their
number is being used illicitly
s h o u l d i n f o r m the C o l l e g e
Program Advisory Section
immediately.
L o b b y O f f
A discovery by U n i o n Officers
that Governing Body will not be
meeting on 2 3 M a r c h has forced
the U n i o n to call oil a lobby of
Governors planned lor that day.
The lobby was to be the
culmination of the Union's
tuition fees campaign. T h e
Governors are i n fact meeting
today but the subject of tuition
fees is not on the agenda.
Rector agrees with Eiion
T h e Rector has approved
Refectory Committee C h a i r m a n
Professor Elilon's new proposal lor
calculating the regulator, which
could put prices up by 10 percent
in the next 5 months.
U n i o n P r e s i d e n t M a r y
Attenborough is very annoyed
over the affiar and thinks the
College is moving towards a
"confrontation situation". She
has recommended a one day
refectory boycott this term and a
continuous boycott from the start
of next term.
She told reporters that nobody
on the College side had been able
to explain w h y the scheme had
been approved. T h e Rector had
told her to speak to College
Secretary M i c k e y Davies, who
had in turn referred her to
This year's Annual Inter-CCU
Swimming Gala took place last
Tuesday evening. Fielding a
virtually unchanged team from
last year's success, Guilds were
convincing winners of the
Governor's Challenge Shield, but
were unable to take the Linstead
Cup (Water Polo competition) for
the first time in several years,
losing the replay to R C S .
As usual, the devious mind of
Cliff Spooner came up with an
amusing novelty race that was
very p o p u l a r a m o n g the
swimmers and equally amusing
for the spectators. After several
heats and semi-finals, the final
was very closely fought with the
RCS swimmer victorious.
Guilds won all the men's events
with several good lower placings
and were convincing winners of
the two relay events. However, the
R C S ladies won three of their four
races, while Guilds took more
consistent lower placings and
also claimed the two relay events.
Domestic Secretary C a p t a i n
Lindley or back to the Rector.
The boycott proposals were
due to be discussed at yesterday's
U n i o n meeting.
Flats Available
If there is sufficient demand
there is a strong possibility of a
number of fiats and bedsits near
Gloucester R o a d T u b e station,
which could be available at the
beginning of next term. T h e rent
should be substantially less than
Â£15 per week.
If anyone is interested they
should contact M i c h a e l A r t h u r in
the Welfare Centre on the 3 r d
floor of the U n i o n Building
immediately.
Bottle Snatch
There were red faces i n Mines
U n i o n last week alter raiders from
another College succeeded in
capturing the top of the Mines
bottle.
A n d a F E L I X reporter was
threatened with the removal of a
part of his anatomy if Mines'
shame should reach the pages of
F E L I X .
The bottle, a trophy of Mines'
recent victory against Camborne
in the bottle match, was behind
the U n i o n bar when the raiders
struck o n T h u r s d a y n i g h t .
M i n g l i n g with the drinkers they
waited for a moment when the
bar stall' were fully occupied.
Suddenly they dashed under
the counter, grabbed the bottle
and pushed their way out through
the crowd. A n attempt to stop
them resulted in the rescue of the
bottom part of the bottle.
Alter running at top speed
across Beit Q u a d they got away
on motorbikes along Prince
Consort R o a d . Students collating
F E L I X i n the office heard the
commotion but were not aware of
what was happening.
In the water polo competition
for the Linstead Cup, Mines lost to
both Guilds and R C S while the
latter two drew against each
other. Finally, after Spboner's lot
had finished their "demonstra-
tion" games, we were treated to a
thrilling play-off between Guilds
and R C S who were very evenly
matched, with R C S scoring a
string of goals in the final quarter
to take the game and the trophy.
Lastly, the President's race saw
Andy Lewis take the bottle of
whisky from a gallant Mark
Corrigan who managed to swim
into the goal posts at both ends
(ouch!), while Mary Attenborough
made an heroic swim to challenge
Chris Fox for third place.
Final points were: Guilds:
127.5. Mines: 86.5 R C S : 71
Thanks are due to Cliff Spooner
and his staff for running the,
events and refereeing the Water
P o l o , to S t e v e T a y l o r for
organising the beer, and to Mike
Elkin for the (dubious) scoring
and for presenting the trophies.
