Yesterday's UGM
As expected provided plenty of excitement, chiefly concerning the
implementation of the regulator and the motion on recruitment. Personally I was
delighted and disgusted respectively.
Refectories
Not only has Professor Eilon seen fit to set the wage element of the regulator at
1%, by claiming in was "executive action" and thereby preventing Refectory
Committee from voting on it, but it now appears that this system has been applied
BACKDATED TO JANUARY contributing towards the 4% price rise in the
refectories which occurred YESTERDAY.
Such blatant disregard for the attitudes of students at IC is incredible! After one
amendment, the recommendation by ICU President Mary Attenborough was to;
) Hold a total boycott of all refectories this Thursday,
i) Hold a continuous total boycott commencing next term,
ii) Withdraw student support from the "Meet Imperial College" scheme, if the
Exec, feel it is warranted.
College in general, and Professor Eilon and Captain Lindley in particular,
obviously think we are going to accept the ridiculous new regulator and the
unacceptable resulting price rises. Presumably, since they have ignored our token
one-day boycott, they feel we cannot organise a continuous boycott of all
refectory outlets. We must show them that we can. Unless EVERYBODY can find
alternatives to eating in the refectories next term the current situation, where two
or three people can arbitrarily increase the price of our meals, will continue.
SUPPORT THE BOYCOTT ON THURSDAY!
SUPPORT THE BOYCOTT NEXT TERM!
Recruitment
The motion on Job Recruitment which caused so much controversy at the last
UGM (Hustings) was finally passed yesterday. I felt that the motion, as well as
tacitly supporting Apartheid, contained several unnecessary phrases such as
"propagating particular political bandwagons". Surely the right of individuals to
choose where they work could have been preserved without painting the picture
of a political Union battling against the Careers Advisory Service. I think Andy
Lewis should not have prevented the second amendment from being heard in the
way that he did, although with that many miners at the meeting they could have
done just about anything.
The only two good points that came out of the affair were that;
i) The motion didn't explicitly support South Africa or its system,
ii) A Union meeting can be kept quorate for serious issues.
University Challenge
On a slightly lighter note, the team representing us in University Challenge has
now been chosen. It consists of; Andrew Gray (Biochem. PG), Bob Hart (Aero. 3),
Damion Hassan (Maths 1) and Frank James (HOST PG). The reserve is Nick
Griffin (Chem Eng 2). Congratulations to those five and commiserations to the
rest who entered: it was a very hard test. I know Pete Davies (ACC Chairprimate)
wants a mention as he was the only person to know "Peracles".
FELIX
Papers for ne"xt year's committee are now up in the FELIX Office. Membership
for next year will probably be 50 p but anyone who joins now will only have to pay
30 p for next year. If you wish to join FELIX, or stand for a committee post, come
along and see me in the FELIX Office. Membership until the end of this session is
free!
Personal Column
My apologies to Mr. Raouf Zaidan for mispelling his name last week in the
letters' page. Whilst on the subject of apologies, I know Malcolm Brain wants to
apologise for his language at yesterday's UGM but feels that there was intense
provocation.
Finally I would like to thank Sheyne for all his help during my time as Editor. He
has been an extremely good friend, not only to myself but to many others as well. I
know we will miss him very much and I'd like to wish him every success in the
future. Cheers,
John.

represented what must have
seemed to her to have been the
only possible action left to stop the
motion from being passed.
A n estimated 200 students were
present when the meeting was
terminated; a number considera-
bly in excess of some past
meetings. T h e time at which the
quorum was challenged cannot
be used as an excuse either as it
was obvious, even to the less
enthusiastic about the motion,
that a vote was imminent.
I personally no longer have any
confidence in a U n i o n President
who can call quorum at his/her
own U n i o n General Meeting. I
would therefore like to see a
truthful explanation for M a r y ' s
performance though I feel that no
excuse can be acceptable.
Yours respectfully,
A n d y Lewis
R S M U President
I C U Vice President
Dear Sir, - Recent events show
that I . C . U . President is blatantly
out of touch with grassroots
opinion. She supported the
contraversial motion on Northern
Ireland which was overwhelm-
ingly rejected. She is also bitterly
opposed to a current proposal to
reform U n i o n policy on j o b
recruitment.
This proposal has the active
support of all the C . C . U .
Presidents and was debated for
three-quarters of an hour at the
last U . G . M . A t this meeting two
amendments (one proposed by
Miss Attenborough) were convin-
cingly rejected. M a r k Corrigan
had just finished his summing up
speech when Miss Attenborough
called 'quorum'.
W h a t were her motives? She
has been happy to see her own pet
motions passed at inquorate
U n i o n meeting with only minutes
left. A t the last U . G . M . the new
policy was about to be put to the
vote with five minutes remaining.
T h e excuse that 'quorum' was
called because people had to go to
lectures is clearly incompatible
with these facts.
While Miss Attenborough was
putting forward her amendment
a student decided to propose that
'She be not heard". A t this stage
Miss Attenborough 'threatened'
to call 'quorum'. Such a threat is
excusable if made in jest, but an
abuse of the concept of q u o r u m
when used in political wheeler-
dealing. It is clear that Miss
Attenborough called q u o r u m
because she disagreed with the
motion about to be passed. H e r
action was entirely selfish.
D u r i n g the meeting she said
that she would be ashamed to
belong to the U n i o n if such a
policy were passed. It is apparent
that the political ideas of Miss
Attenborough are her prime
consideration and that she has
shown herself able to disregard
the feelings and opinions of her
members.
Hence she is rapidly losing
touch with these members and
ought to consider carefully the
implications of this conclusion.
Yours sincerely,
M a r k Clegg

T o W h o m It M a y Concern, -
Whilst always recognising that we
are constantly heading towards
m a x i m u m entropy I feel that on
last Sunday (11th) I received
more than my fair share.
T o return at 11.30 after a hard
night's day and find that my room
has been broken into and
subjected to quirky acts of
vandalism is. in itself, unpleasant.
C o m b i n e d with the theft of mv
M a n a s C l u b tie. and various
other acts v which I have assumed
to be a personal a t t a c k , it was a
traumatic end to a long day.
I would therefore like to
challenge the perportator(s^ ol
this deed to a dual in Princes
G d n s . at d a w n . F a i l i n g
satisfaction an apology and ,Â£2.50
for a new tie will do.

Dear J o h n ,
I would like to express my
concern about one aspect of the
recent s a b b a t i c a l e l e c t i o n
campaigns. I was surprised to see
the current I C U President
actively supporting one of the
presidential election candidates
by canvassing on his behalf. (This
not only took the form of extolling
the virtues of her 'protege', but
also of making some remarks
about his opponent which have
been described as 'somewhat
slanderous').
Reference to the I C U Blueboqk
.assured me that there is no
impediment to any incumbent of
sa U n i o n post supporting, or even
proposing a particular candidate
for his/her o w n job. It does,
however, seem rather unethical.
Surely, if more widespread, this
practice could lead to a situation
where the mantle of office would
be handed down to the favorite
son and the ruling dynasty-
continued.
In an 'immature and apolitical
union' like C & G U no executive
member may propose or second
anv candidate. It is also an
unwritten rule, perhaps because
of our inherent democratic
instincts, tharthe students of City
and Guilds choose the executive
that they want unhindered by the
opinions (however strongly they
max be held) ol the current union
officers.
Should M s . Attenborough's
support not prose c o u n t e r
productive and her favoured
candidate be elected. I only hope
that he continues to implement
her election promises of 1978 a n d
that 'Democracy in A c t i o n '
continues to thrive at Imperial
College. Yours sincerely,
S i m o n L e a
Dear Sir, - M a y I take this
opportunity to offer m y deepest
apologies to J a n Czernuszka from
whose n a m e I e r r o n e o u s l y
ommited a 'z', but I never could
spell Irish names.
However, I was rather puzzled
by his statement in a letter to last
week's F E L I X which suggested
that the M o u r n i n g er I mean
the ' M o r n i n g C l o u d ' editor "could
spend his and his reader's' time on more
worthwhile topics." Surely was it
n o t he t h a t c o n s u m e d a
jconsiderable amount of U . G . M .
