Motorway madness?
A report published today describes odd
events that have occurred on Britain's
motorways. In one case two little old ladies
couldn't face joining other motorists on the

shoulder. They told police that the hard
shoulder was far less dangerous than the
motorway although they did complain that
the surface was too rough.
It appears that they left the motorway at
every exit. They explained that they followed
the hard shoulder off at each intersection,
drove round the roundabout and then
rejoined the motorway.
The report goes on to describe the incident
of a Rolls-Royce driver who was found
changing a wheel late at night on the M1 - in
the fast lane.
