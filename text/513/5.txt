PG Tips
A few months ago I passed on
information from the National
Union of Students to the effect
that Postgraduate demonstrating
rates had been set at £2.74 per
hour. N
Several people have since
wondered why this College is still
paying last year's rate of £2.59.
The demonstrating rate is
linked to the bottom point of the
lecturers' pay scale following an
agreement between the Commit-
tee of Vice Chancellors and
Principals, the Association of
University Teachers and the N U S .
From 1st October lecturers
have been awarded a 6.1 percent
academic "anomaly" payment,
prior to a national settlement of
their salary scales. This rise paid
to postgraduates would result in
£2.74 per hour.
However this College has
decided not to award the 6.1 per
cent increase now and further
adjust the rate after the national
settlement. Instead the whole
increase will be applied in one go
and backdated to 1st October
1978.
This means that the final rate
will be more than £2.74 per hour
but postgraduates will have to
wait until the summer term before
receiving a large backdated
payment.
Last year when the same
situation occurred departments
made the backdated payments
automatically. But there could be
complications for students doing
irregular demonstrating outside
their departments and it is worth
noting how much work you have
done.
College's explanation of the
arrangement seems satisfactory
to me at this moment but I shall
raise the question again if there is
n o a g r e e m e n t of a n e w
demonstrating rate by May.
Departmental Groups
D e p a r t m e n t a l p o s t g r a d u a t e
groups are entitled to a grant from
the IC Postgraduate Group to
assist in organising their own
activities, social or otherwise.
Very few groups have taken up
this option.
It is not too late to apply for
money now. Groups should apply
to me (c/o IC Union Office) or
Mike Wort (Min Tech PG), stating
how much money they would like
and for what purpose.
Ploughman's Lunch
The next P G ploughman's
lunch will be on 2nd April in the
Union Senior C o m m o n Room.
This one will be even better value
than the last, i.e. same price -
more food. Tickets will be on sale
soon.

Just a few items for your
attention this week, P m sorry
for the absence of I C C A G
articles in recent weeks, I've
been feeling a bit lazy
recently, but here goes.
T h e first thing is that I've
promised to bring some people
along to help redecorate some of
the rooms at a place called
"Providence R o w " down by
Liverpool Street main line
station. 50 Crispin Street to be
exact. This establishment takes
care ofthe poor, the destitute and
the homeless and is run by the
Sisters of Mercy. At the risk of
producing too long an article,
below are the objects of the
refuge.
1) to provide a free night's
lodging, supper, breakfast and
washing facilities for all genuine
applicants, men and women.
2) to allow applicants who are
actively seeking work to remain
until work is found.
3) to provide lodging, washing
and cooking facilities for homeless
families until accommodation is
found.
4) to help persons in or out of
the refuge to r e h a b i l i t a t e
themselves.
5) to provide a home for women
and girls.
6) to supply sandwiches to
hungry persons coming to the
doors of the Refuge and food
parcels to poor families.
7) to assist Providence (Row)
Families H o u s i n g Association to
p r o v i d e a c c o m m o d a t i o n for
homeless families.
8) t o p r o v i d e H o s t e l
accommodation for business girls
and students at moderate charges.
I could go on to quote the
achievements side of their leaflet
but I've got other things to say
and space is r u n n i n g short.
By the way, the venue for this
painting is, leave from the U n i o n
arcja it 9.45 am. this Sunday,
the ' 8 t h M a r c h .
There is going to be a Task-
Force Special this Saturday
(subject to confirmation) in which
we are going to concentrate all
our efforts on the one job of
tidying up the house of an old
couple in Notting H i l l . T h e venue
for this event is at the U n i o n arch
at 10.00 a m Sat 17th. r
Interested in any of these then
please contact me via the
chemistry letter racks, the U n i o n
Office or internal 4162.
Cheers,

for a motion on Northern Ireland,
an action which inspired the

he possessed quite strong feelings
on the subject - as did I when I
wrote the editorial comment. By
doing so I was exercising my right
of freedom of expression, which I
fear would be removed if J a n

Dear Sir, - As a fairly regular
listener to Imperial College
Radio, I must express my
disappointment at the recent
programming changes. These
alterations have removed the
'Specialist Programmes' from 9-
11 slot and condensed them into
three 1-hour transmissions.
A m o n g other things, this has
resulted in the replacement of the
' R h y t h m and Blues' and classical
music programmes (both of which
will be missed by many) by 'Prole-
Feed' mindless pop which caters
f o r t h e l o w e s t c o m m o n
denominator and surely only
pleases those whose requests are
read out - while nobody gets a
chance to hear some new,
different music, enthusiastically
introduced by a knowledgeable
devotee, as was previously the
case.
T o my mind, the central issue
here resembles the B B C 2 / I T V
Contrast - should we replace
'Panorama' by a banal ' S i t - C o m '
(or 'The O l d Grey Whistle-Test'
by 'Crossroads') merely because
the latter alternatives require less
mental effort from potential
audiences? O b v i o u s l y some
compromise is inevitable until
I.C. R a d i o 2 (!?) hits the airwaves
(with continuous current-affairs,
or live relays of barnights from the
U n i o n Bar?) But please bring
back ' R and B' and 'Opus 301'!
Let us remember minorities, and
encourage any individualism in
this college whose students can so
easily end their courses and find
themselves grey, lifeless stereo

Dear Sir, - W e have seen a lot
about the Unification C h u r c h
(commonly called the " M o o n i e s "
by the media) in the papers
recently. Yet very little remains
known about this group. There
have been allegations of people
being kidnapped, brainwashed,
and separated from their families.
As a member ofthe Unification
C h u r c h , I a m interested in
making clear to the students at I C
exactly what my position is, and
in answering some of these
allegations, based on my personal
experience.
Firstly, I would like to say that I
have never been kidnapped (for
here I am, still studying for my
degree).
As for brainwashing, I have
considered at great length the
claims ofthe Unification C h u r c h ,
the justifications used by the
C h u r c h for those claims, and the
underlying organisation behind
their teachings. After a fair
amount of time, I came to agree
with their views. I was in no way
ipressurized - in fact I did a lot of
research into the philosophical
theory of the C h u r c h on my own.
Regarding my family, I found
that my parents were initially
alarmed and presented me with a
lot of anti-Moonie literature,
which I took into consideration in
m y decision. Since joining the
Moonies, I have in fact seen a lot
more of my parents than before
(e.g. they insisted on seeing me at
least once a week for some time
after I told them). As to family
relations, my parents and I have
had m u c h deeper discussions
about G o d , philosophy, and the
meaning of life than we ever had
before.
So I can honestly say that the
Unification C h u r c h has brought
me closer to my parents. I have
never been taught to hate my
parents. If a-nyone wishes to find
out more about the Moonies, I
suggest they attend the meeting
this Friday in Elec. E n g . 508 at
12.30.
Yours,
Paul Wright

T o all members of R . C . S . U . - I
offer my sincere apologies for my
n o n - a p p e a r a n c e as returning
officer at the results meeting for
the R o y a l College of Science
Union elections on the ninth of
March. This was caused by an
unforgivable oversight on my part
and I deeply regret any inconven-
ience or strain caused to the
candidates.
Yours,

Dear Sir, - I a m shocked to find
that the price of 'scotch eggs' in
the U n i o n refectory is more
expensive than Harrolds. Even at
a delicatessen in F u l h a m R d they
are 22 p compared to 28 p in the
refectory. Furthermore cooked
sausages are a staggering £1.12
per lb. I think its disgusting.
Yours faithfully,
F. Bongolia
