IMPERIAL COLLEGE 1ST vs THAMES VALLEY: 4-1
Alter dropping off the second and third teams to play their ill-fated
games against Richmond the first team proceeded to the Thames Valley
ground.
This was a top of the table clash with Thames Valley having to hold
I.C. to a draw to be certain of promotion.
We arrived to find the water table rising and that the home team had
not yet rowed out to put up the posts.
It would appear that I.C., who are
used to playing o n some of the
best pitches in London, would
have to beat the pitch as well as
the opposition. However they rose
to it quickly putting on the
pressure, not allowing the ball to
stick in the mud or the opposition
to settle. In the first half I.C.
showed greater determination
a n d a n e a g e r n e s s t o g e t
forward that often found B o b
Middleton in the offside trap.
Imperial opened the score sheet
with two goals worked from short
corners.
The second half began with
Thames Valley making an all out
push. Imperial soaked u p the
pressure for ten minutes before
letting in a goal. Although it could
have been avoided it took the
steam out of the attack and
revitalized the I.C. effort. After a
period of hard and fast play by
both sides I.C. took control after;
their third goal. T h e constant
onslaught brought a fourth goal
and a justifiable score line. The
scorers were Bob Middleton with
a hat-trick, and a jug, and Andy
Hares. Commiserations to Mark
Button, and the wooden spoon,
for missing a penalty.
Imperial have only to win the
m a t c h o n S a t u r d a y against
Borough R d . College, to get
promotion.
The team were: - G. Corbin, I.
Crowe, S. Boat, G. Street, M,
Buttons, T. Creek, A. Hares, D.
Hatter, B. Middleton, T. Debarr, J.

Last Saturday, the Cross
Country Club ran in the final race
in the Reebok League, at Oxford.
Yet again, the turnout was very
poor, however it was great to see
Rich Green at the course when we
arrived in Mrs. Acford's car.
The course was a six-mile mud-
bath, suitable more for bike
scrambling than cross-country
running. A very fast start left most
of the IC team wallowing at the
back of the field. Rich Green was
the first IC runner to finish in an
excellent 27th considering the
difficult conditions. Bryan Acford,
encouraged by the pleas from his
mum to keep hiskitclean, kept his
balance and finished 48th. Ian

Last Friday, I.C. I played
their first Middlesex League
m a t c h o f the season against
P E N G U I N II. A weakened I.C.
t e a m took the pool expecting
a h a r d game.
In the first quarter play was
very close, the P E N G U I N team,
being fairly fast but without much
imagination. The only goal
scored was by Cliff Spooner,
putting I.C. 1-0 up.
This was the score at half time,
the second quarter being goalless.
The third quarter however,
produced more goals. First, Pete
McCartney scored with a long
shot while P E N G U I N had a man
sent out- Then Cliff Spooner
C R O S S C O U N T R Y
Stirling, he proceeded to fall over
on various parts of the course, and
crawled (literally) his way round
to finish a dismally pathetic 65th.
Special mention must go however
for his attempt at setting up yet
another everyday challenge for
"Persil's" biological action. Ian

Longhurst found the going tough,
and was o n e of the many w h o
failed to finish.
T h e f i n a l l e a g u e r e s u l t s ,
showed that IC had finished 8th
out of 19 University and college
teams, a n d were the second
college team, finishing behind
Oxford Poly, which w a s a bit
disappointing.
Ian Morton

scored his second to increase I.C.'s
lead. B u t P E N G U I N ' S counter
attacking brought its reward at
the end of the quarter, one of their
players arrived i n front of goal
unmarked to make the score 3-1.
T h e last quarter started with
I.C. trying to hang on to their 2
goal lead. This was increased by
M i k e M c C a r t n e y w h o scored
with a hard shot into the corner of
the goal. P E N G U I N pulled a goal
back again with a long shot, but
they were kept away from
shooting positions for the most
part, and 4-2 was the final score.
Team: K. Ribar, A. Smith, C.
Spooner, S. Tayler, D. Chadwick, T.
Rockingham, P. McCartney, M.

Firstly, a notice to all members,
there will be the Table Tennis
Club Annual General Meeting on
Wednesday 21st of March to elect
the officers for 1979-80. Papers
will be up in the T.T. room in a few
days' time for nominations.
Meanwhile more pearls of prose
from the matchless match-

From 2-1 down, the firsts
clawed their way back into the
match, with the result that they

This result finally sealed the fate
of the fourth team, now doomed to
division 6 for eternity (well,
another year anyway). Lambert
and Cobrin both played like
corpses (dead ones at that!), but
Rutherford stared the spectre of
defeat firmly in the mouth and
triumphed valiantly yet one more
time (if this isn't the biggest load
of....)

The thirds went shopping for
three easy points in this match.
Stean won his sets comfortably,
2 2 N D
Reed won two, having not slept for
two days (silly b r) and Hewkin
considered his record of having
never missed Faulty Towers more
i m p o r t a n t t h a n b e a t i n g a n
opponent he had beaten twice
already - and so gave away his
final set (the match had been won
7-1 by that time). A n attempt was
made to relieve M and S of a sign
or two, but the alarms (being
tested coincidentally with the
attempted theft) scared me to
death!

AMALG DENTAL (away) 4
The score does not reflect the
match as I.C. only produced two
players (where were you S.C.?)
and Lambert made life difficult by
losing a match - but the best side
won in the end. (Oh, Rutherford
won 3 again...again...again...).
This match was the second time
A.D. have rearranged a match,
and the other two haven't even
been agreed upon yet (perhaps
they clash with appointments for
fillings - in their brains!)
Remember, do you think you
can organize the club next year
better than we have? If so (and it
probably won't be hard) stand!
The posts will be President,
Secretary, Treasuerand perhaps-
Publicity Officer, (if we want one
after this year!)
After the Swimming Gala it's -
see ya from SUPERDAMP.
