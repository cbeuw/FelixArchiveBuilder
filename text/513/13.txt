Last year the m e n s ' t e a m
played m a n y matches against
local clubs and other colleges,
but unfortunately we lost in
the U . L . U . C u p to R o y a l
Holloway College.
T h i s year we hope to play at
least as m a n y matches again,
w i t h possibly some second
t e a m matches. Also we hope
to regain the cup w h i c h we
won i n 1977.
W e hope to increase the
number of ladies and mixed
matches this year.

Last Wednesday saw the
Imperial College All-Stars lose 2-
3 to Queen M a r y College in the
final match of the season. The
team comprised of Stroppy (the
8 t h d w a r f , G r u m p y ' s t w i n !
b r o t h e r ) , J o h a n n S e b a s t i a n
Cruyff, M . F . Walrus, L u i g i
R a v i o l i M a g h y a r , Christopher
R o b i n , and Rastus A d o l f O d i n g a
O d i n g a . This was (slightly) a
grudge match, a Q . M . C . player
having told us earlier in the
season: "Wail until you come to our
place.'" We, therefore, went well
prepared: L u i g i took his whip,
and we also took a screw-
driver^?).
T h e matches were fairly
uneventful, except that when
Rastus played his frame, he was
rewarded with threats of being;
whipped when he missed easy
shots, and shouts of "More molasses
tonight, Rastus", for good shots.
After the match, the team
entertained the Q . M . C . students
in their U n i o n bar with a little
show of flagellation. They then
proceeded to the tube station with
the chant: "We all agree, Q.M.C.
are w'nk'rs!" By this time, all the
team members, barring Rastus
who had only drunk one orange
juice ("Disgusting", said the
Walrus), had each consumed
about seven pints, and so the train
compartment was booming with
rugby, er-snooker songs all the
w a y h o m e , m u c h to the
amusement (?) of the other
passengers.
A n d they lived happily ever
after!
( M a n y thanks to those regulars of
the ' B ' team who are leaving I.C.
this year: A . L e c l e z i o , J .
Sweeting, M . F . Cherry, _ M .

City and Guilds
By the time this is read, the Election Union Meeting will have been
held. I wish all the new Exec, every success for the coming year- make it
another good one.
On Tuesday the Inter C.C.U. Swimming Gala was won convincingly
by Guilds. The points were: -
Guilds: 127.5
Mines: 86.5 (?)
R.C.S.: 71
Congratulations for winning their respective races go to: -
Bruce Willis - breaststroke,
Keith Rogers - crawl & butterfly,
Martin Livey - backstroke,
Neeran - Ladies crawl.
All four relays were also won by Guilds.
Thanks are due to Bruce Willis for spending a lot of time in the pool
organising the winning team and for everyone who turned up for
practice.
We narrowly lost the water polo for the first time in many years. We
drew with r.c.s. beat mines and then were beaten by r.c.s. in the reply.
O n Wednesday the 7th Guilds rugby teams gave r.c.s. 1 s t s a n d 2 n d s a
routing in the Sparkes C u p matches, winning 22-3 and 26-0
respectively. Congratulations to all concerned. No doubt the
performance was repeated on the 14th against mines although the
result was not known at the time of writing.
Still on a sporting note, the I.C. Games will be held on Wednesday
25th April, which is the first Wednesday of next term. If anyone is
interested please see Dave Walls a.s.a.p. You don't have to be a brilliant
athlete to take part and really enjoy yourselves, I went down last year
and had a great time.
Last Saturday, the 10th March, the Election Rag Collection was held
in Knightsbridge. It was a miserable day with a poor turnout - only four
people other than the candidates and the present Exec, were there,
however a creditable £236 was collected bringing the Guilds Rag Total
to above £4000.
Elsewhere in this FELIX there should be an O . C awards article - do
read it if you think you know someone who has contributed significantly
to Guilds Union or if you're after a travel scholarship.
