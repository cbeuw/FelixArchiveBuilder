O
ne film tradition forever
etchedintothecollective
movie-going zeitgeist is
that of the Halloween
horror film. Each year crowds
gather throughout late October
itching for their horror fix. And
whilst one shouldn’t undermine the
importance of Paranormal Activity
as a ground-breaking contemporary
horror, it is fair to say the latter
films in the series have become a bit
dry. So instead of sitting through
the same formula once again this
year, why not consider watching
some different modern day horror
classics?

Old Bond returns in Spectre Mississippi
Grind

Starring: Ryan Reynolds, Ben
Mendelsohn. 108 minutes.
S
ome films move too fast,
others too slow; some have
a pace and a direction,
others just a direction; but
some move so slowly, with such
little direction, that you wonder if
they were directed at all or if they
one day just materialised in their
distributors’ postbox. And then
there’s Mississippi Grind. The story
of Gerry (Ben Mendelssohn), a
down and out gambling addict
in Iowa who hits the road down
the Mississippi after meeting the
roguish, carefree Curtis (Ryan
Reynolds) in the hopes of winning
enough money to pay his way out
of trouble. Its narrative unfolds in
a similar way to how a ball of wool
might unspool while having the end
of its thread batted nonchalantly
by a kitten. Not many filmmakers
these days outside of Paul Thomas
Anderson and (at a push) Quentin
Tarantino are producing films with
such a laid-back and character-
driven feel – and Mississippi Grind is
so relaxed that it makes Anderson’s
latest, Inherent Vice, look like the
new Mission: Impossible.
In this way it feels less like a
movie and more like a two-hour
soak in a warm, Southern-fried
bath of melancholy. Images of dim,
strung-up lightbulbs and neon
signs lining dusky backstreets or
midnight dive bars may produce

a visual colour palette of glowing
yellows, oranges, and reds, but the
film’s emotional palette consists
only of a deep, deep blue. Exploring
the dangers of gambling, addiction,
and isolation through two distinct
character studies, the film does
well at portraying the hopelessness
of Gerry and Curtis’s lives. The
freeform, jazz-like unkemptness
of the narrative only serves to
strengthen this; you feel the lack
of direction not just in the film but
within the lives and the souls of the
protagonists.
Mississippi Grind has this in
common with its directors’ more
well-known film Half Nelson.
P
erhaps the most well-
known of director Werner
Herzog’s many entries into
the documentary genre,
Grizzly Man tells the story of
Timothy Treadwell and his thirteen
summers spent in the Alaskan
wilderness, which he claimed was
the only way of protecting its
native grizzly bears from poachers.
His story is ultimately brought
to an end during Treadwell’s
thirteenth summer, when he and
his girlfriend Amie Huguenard
were killed by one of the bears with
which he supposedly shared a close
relationship.
Treadwell’s tragic – though
undeniably unusual – story is made
up of an edit of over 90 hours of
footage he filmed himself in the
style of a strange, childish nature
documentary, intertwined with
interviews conducted by Herzog.
The result is a uniquely personal
look at the character of Treadwell –
a flawed and deeply insecure person.
Known for his hands-off approach
to documentary film making,
Herzog – reminiscent of Louis
Theroux – allows people to expose
themselves by saying absolutely
nothing himself. An example of
this style is seen when Treadwell’s
‘close friend’ Warren Queeny gives
the camera an obviously rehearsed
and almost comically hammy
monologue about his lost friend;
the static, lengthy shot of Warren
combines with the way in which the
scene was shot to allow us to feel
the ‘fakeness’ of the performance.
This kind of subtle story-telling is
something very few documentarians
could pull off.
Themajorquestionexploredinthis
film is what exactly was Treadwell
doing spending months at a time in
the exclusive company of bears and
foxes? Was he an inveterate liar?
Was he just a passionate lunatic?
One interpretation is simply that
Treadwell stayed in this secluded
world, one which he romanticised
to a near ridiculous degree, in an
attempt to escape the realities of the
real one.
Worth noting is the unusual
child-like wonder with which
Treadwell refers to nature and its
inhabitants in his footage; by giving
his supposed ‘bear-friends’ names
such as ‘Mr Chocolate’,Treadwell is
shown to sentimentalise the natural
world. He seemed to see it as a
benevolent and balanced system – a
view, it is suggested, that comforted
him. This view is coldly cut down
by the voice of Herzog who, in one
scene involving Treadwell sharing a
‘moment’ with a bear, says that its
“blank stare speaks only of a half-
bored interest in food”;it is clear that
Herzog sees Treadwell as someone
trying to discredit cruelty in order
to continue his own comforting
world-view. Ultimately however,
Herzog did not make this film
to discredit and mock Treadwell.
Instead he merely presents to us a
study of modern humanity – one
that is as entertaining as it is bizarre.

S
ometimes escapism is just
too bloody brilliant to resist.
The friend I saw Spectre with
remarked on the bus home
that returning to the mundanities
of everyday student life at Imperial
after watching a movie like that was
“going to be a bit shit”. He’s not the
cheeriest person in the world – he
studies biology, who could blame
him? – but in my mind he certainly
had a point.
The Bond movies have been
fuelling the fantasies of children,
grown-ups, and grown-up children
for generations, and it looked like
they would be unstoppable after
having survived the “gritty reboot”
trend of the late noughties, like
Batman Begins and 2009’s Star Trek.
Casino Royale redefined
Bond for the 21st
Century, with
powerfully tangible action, excellent
performances with the perfect
amount of realism to them, and
craftsmanship that allowed the
franchise to transcend simple
action-movie escapism and become
a genuinely great film. The sins of
the following Quantum of Solace
were soon forgiven as Skyfall was
hailed as a fantastic return to form
but, looking back at it, there was
something a little off. It had begun
to rehash the trademarks of older
Bond movies in the form of daft
plot points, yet it attempted to
keep a straight face whilst doing it;
retrospectively the balance didn’t
quite work.
Perhaps this is why Spectre’s
production team decided to ramp up
the escapism even further, so much
so that the artfully-done action
setpieces of Skyfall feel stiff and
greyscaled in comparison.The latest
entry in the Bond franchise is fully-
fledged old-school 007; sweeping
action spectacle, cool cars, gadgets,
and dry martinis. The opening
sequence says it all; a flashy tracking
shot follows Bond (Daniel Craig)
through the streets of Mexico City
on the Day of the Dead festival to
the hotel room of an attractive
young woman who snogs him then
saunters over to the bed, whereon
he mumbles “I won’t be a minute”
and promptly hops out of the
window with a rifle strapped to his
side. This is followed by an airborne
brawl with a helicopter pilot and
passenger, complete with hanging
outside of the cabin and multiple
somersaults – in broad daylight, no
less – arriving at a smooth segue into
the opening credits,accompanied by
images of Craig topless with faceless
blondes stroking his shoulders and
producing fire. This isn’t the Bond
you might remember, but it’s the
one your dad will.
Where this refreshed, enjoyable
approach makes itself most clear
is in the performances. Craig’s
Bond, which will most likely be
remembered as one of the best
overall, has a reinvigorated sense of
dry humour. Ralph Fiennes’ M is
joyously stony-faced and grumpy.
Ben Wishaw’s Q gets a lovable
touch of the modern tech geek.
Dave Bautista’s performance as
Mr Hinx is a classic piece of pure,
terrifying muscle – one of the best
sequences in the film has at its
centre him gouging out a man’s eyes
with his thumbs because the man
happens to be sat in a chair he wants
to be sitting in, all without a word.
None are more gleeful than that of
Christoph Waltz, who lies coiled at
the heart of the movie in a perfect
throwback role, with a knowing
villainous smile and his trademark
Austrian accent practically dripping
with cheese.
But with a switch back to the
sensibilities of old, Spectre’s missteps
show up problems not just with
the movie itself, but with the Bond
franchise as a whole. The modern
action movie has been reworked so
many times this decade it’s hard to
keep track, but with milestones like
the exhilarating Mad Max: Fury
Road so fresh in our minds it’s hard
not to realise that there’s something
missing in the action. Explosions
are epic but distant, punches clip
but never connect.A bigger problem
with the film can be outlined by
comparing its torture scene with
that of Casino Royale. One of the
highlights of an already brilliant
film, the “rope-torture” sequence
featuring Le Chiffre and Bond in a
The Babadook
Horror films often get a bad rap
of being rather stupid. The Babadook
completely defies this myth. It tells
the story of the recently widowed
Amelia, who is terrorised at the
hands of a monster, perhaps more
deeply linked with her inner demons
than one may think. The film oozes
with metaphors, unsettling imagery,
and intensely interesting ideas.
Sinister
There seems to be a theme in some
recent horror films: a big-name
actor (in this case, Ethan Hawke) is
hired in place of the traditional no-
name lead. Here, for once, this idea
actually works: Hawke’s incredible
performance carries this film, whose
unique premise and execution is
centres around brutal murders
recorded on Super 8mm reels.
Mama
Based on the short film of the
same name, Mama tells the story
of two children left for dead who
are ‘adopted’ by a mysterious entity,
which then follows and terrifies
their eventual guardians.The design
of Mama herself is one of the most
terrifying you will see in any horror
film, and the whole experience is
one of classic horror, done right.
basement room with no escape felt
real, dangerous, and quite frankly
terrifying. In comparison, Spectre’s
torture scene leaves Bond strapped
to a chair while Waltz’s entire plot
is revealed during a conveniently
elaborate procedure aiming for a
slow and painful death.It’s moments
like this that were parodied in
another excellent recent action film,
Kingsman: The Secret Service – major
plot points that are so easy on our
hero that it makes it hard to feel
any sense of danger. On top of all
this, the man himself unfortunately
remains quite the sexual harassment
case. I’m not sure what the protocol
is on sleeping with the widow of a
man you threw out of a helicopter
(Monica Bellucci’s literal only scene
in the movie), but the scene itself is
quite a disturbing one out of a Bond
context (or even in one).
Casino Royale remains by far the
most accomplished of Craig’s Bond
films, and on technical terms Skyfall
might well be slightly better. But for
sheer thrill and enjoyment,Spectre is
certainly a hell of a lot more fun.

Something else the two share is
a powerhouse lead. Whilst Half
Nelson boasts Ryan Gosling’s first
truly great performance, Mississippi
Grind has up its sleeve the role Ben
Mendelssohn seems to have been
born to play. It’s exciting seeing
Mendelsohn take centre-stage after
years of notable bit parts appearing
in everything from The Dark Knight
Rises to Killing Them Softly. I’ve
been waiting for him to have this
much screen time since his chilling
turn as Uncle Pope in Aussie crime
drama Animal Kingdom, and he
certainly delivers. Gerry is a quiet,
reserved, hopeless wreck of a man,
the kind you believe in when he
lies to you, and curse when the
obvious truth is revealed. Reynolds
also gives a strong performance as
Curtis, who proves to be the perfect
foil for Gerry. The interaction of
these two painfully lonely men,each
for their own reasons, is where the
heartbreaking centre of the drama
lies.
What the film does less well is
walk the line between moral drama
and emotional torture. Watching
the characters sink further and
further into depravity, poverty, and
desperation is at times a painfully
poignant watch, but at others just
a painful one. Each cocky bet, each
failed hand, each petty attempt at
theft becomes another kick in the
gut from these men you thought you
wanted to spend some time with,
and the film begins to feel rather
like a dirge. While perhaps similar
things can be said of Half Nelson,
that film keeps its viewers’ interest
with gripping subject matter told
with a streak of genuine passion and
desire for redemption. However,
in this film you begin to wonder
whether any such redemption will
arrive at all. Ultimately Mississippi
Grind never manages to combine
a grand narrative sweep with an
intimate character study the way
Half Nelson did and, as a result, it
remains not too much more than an
intimate character study. But, with
gorgeous handheld cinematography,
strong writing and two excellent
performances, it’s a pretty damn
good one.
