How young artists are gaining internet and real-life fame by drawing TV characters
W
hat do you think
of when you think
of fan-art? A quick
refresher for those
of you that have been living under
a wi-fi free rock, it’s art depicting
TV or movie characters, often in
situations that would never make it
to the screen. As fan-art has entered
into the public consciousness it
has been shown as a somewhat
embarrassing pastime. The Graham
Norton Show episode featuring
X-Men: First Class fanart in which
Eric and Charles make out whilst
baking cookies is a case in point. It
was not entirely a misrepresentation,
a quick search of fan-art on Tumblr
or Deviantart, the epicentres of
fandom activity, will reveal more
clumsy iterations of Frodo and Sam
making out, or Harry and Draco
involved in an illicit affair than you
would care to imagine. Gratuitous
costumes are often involved
Dig a little deeper however and
fan-art is likely to surprise.Amongst
the reams of enthusiastically, but
slightly less than skilfully drawn
scenes, are true works of art.
They are beautifully imagined,
and realised with virtuoso skill.
Tumblr user euclase is an artist
whose creations rarely put a foot
wrong. She draws portraits of TV
show characters, focusing mainly
on Supernatural. Her paintings, all
drawn digitally using Photoshop
and a Wacom tablet are almost
lyrical, drawing inspiration from the
Old Masters in their use of colour
and light. The faces of her subjects
seems to glow from within and the
shadows are rich with burnt umber

and ultramarine blue tones. Euclase
manages to imbue her portraits with
feeling and character.
Alice Zhang’s (tumblr user alicexz)
paintings are similarly accomplished
but entirely different in style. She
draws digital paintings that are high
contrast and supersaturated with
colour. Her drawings are awash
with vivid orange, lemon yellow,
and cerulean. Her brushstrokes,
far from being photorealistic are
fluid and stylistically deft. She
has become most known for her
paintings showing the Doctor in his
different incarnations. Her ubiquity
in the Doctor Who fandom caught
he eyes of the powers that be at the
BBC. Now her art is featured on
the covers of the Doctor Who comics
published by Titan. Her painting
of movie scenes, ranging from The
Hunger Games to Drive has gained
her two solo exhibitions (Moments
and Moments II) at the Bottleneck
Gallery in New York.
Many artists keep painting fan-
art no matter how much fame they
achieve. For some, however, it can
offer the way into launching their
original work to a wider audience.
A few years ago, Noelle Stevenson
(tumblr user gingerhaze) burst onto
the Lord of the Rings fandom with
endearing line drawings of the ‘Bro-
ship of the Ring’. She imagined
Gandalf as an old stoner, Shadowfax
as a green VW camper van, the
hobbits as tiny hipsters and Legolas
as a preppy blond with slicked back
hair. Aragorn is a plaid wearing
lumberjack. She shot to instant
fame. After gaining a wide and loyal
following, 3 years ago she launched
a webcomic, Nimona. Through the
years that have followed, in bi-
weekly instalments she told the
story of a shape shifting young
girl apprenticed to a supervillan
(who is not really villainous after
all) and their nemesis. The story of
Nimona, Sir Ballister Blackheart
and Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin
so captured the imagination of
millions of her fans around the
world that on its ending last year,
the webcomic went offline and
was procured by HarperCollins to
be made into a paperback. Nimona
has earned Stevenson New York
Times Bestseller status as well as
numerous awards nominations and
wins including Harvey and Eisner
Awards and Slate Cartoonist Studio
Prize for Best Web Comic in 2012.
She has since illustrated the cover
for Rainbow Rowell’s young adult
novel Eleanor and Park, written
for DC and Marvel Comics, been
a writer on the Disney TV series
Wander Over Yonder and has another
original comic in the works in the
form of Lumberjanes for Boom!
Studios. It is hard to envisage such
heady heights of success in such
short an amount of time without
the help of fan-art.
For those talented and lucky
enough, fan-art can offer the
opportunity to kickstart a successful
career. Being an artist on Tumblr
is equivalent of singing covers of
popular song on YouTube in hopes
What

art?
of attracting a recording deals with
YouTube, being a popular fan-artist
is surprisingly lucrative. Most artists
have etsy shops selling prints of their
artwork on canvas , on tote bags, on
iPhone cases. Most of these artists
attend conventions and expos, at
which many, like Zhang, are treated
like celebrities. It is one thing to be
commercially successful, and quite
another to be taken seriously as an
artist. by the mainstream art world
It is difficult to see these young
women (and it is predominantly
women who are most active in
fandoms) being hailed as the next
great artists in their respective
countries. Fan-art is still seen as
something slightly embarrassing,
and definitely entirely frivolous. Yet,
‘fan-art’ by another name ruled the The Eleventh Doctor. Photo Credit: Alice Zhang.

What else was Michaelangelo
painting in the Sistine Chapel
but Bible fan-art? In case you’re
wondering, Bible fandom is a real
thing, check out Millenial Gospel
on tumblr. Caravaggio’s Narcissus is
Ovid fan-art, every artists who has
ever drawn Helen of Troy or Sirens
of the Battle of Try is swinging on
the coattails of Homer.These artists
too often drew religious or mythical
art to fund their secular artistic
interests.
Religious paintings and paintings
from myth have somewhat fallen
out of favour in recent centuries.
Instead popular culture, a religion
unto itself has taken its place. Even
‘serious’ artists are not immune.
The National Portrait Gallery is
evidence enough of that, artists
draw portraits of celebrities all the
time to reach wider audience. It’s
not so far a leap to be drawing TV
characters. Fan-art is an invaluable
tool for young artists, and with the
rise and rise of celebrity culture, it’s
only a matter of time before fan-
artists achieve critical as well as
commercial success.
