Swim Deep impress at the Roundhouse
W
ith the recent
release of their new
album Mothers,
Swim Deep have
gone on tour around the UK
showing off their reinvented sci-fi
psychedelic sound. Arriving at the
Roundhouse theatre in Camden,
they followed the warm up bands
Catholic Action and The Magic
Gang. The crowd greeted the
Brummy born band with rapturous
applause and eager screams as they
made their way on stage alongside
the ‘Jurassic Park’ theme, oozing
with confidence.
They dived straight into their new
material with ‘Namaste’ entrancing
the audience with futuristic sounds
and effects on the screen behind
them, giving the whole room
a hologram and star ship-like
atmosphere. For this swerve in
sound they used all kinds of musical
skills from magical synthesiser tones
to a sassy saxophone to delight the
audience.The B-town five piece also
played crowd pleasers, returning to
the indie Brit-pop ways of their
debut album, causing the room to
erupt to the sound of ‘Honey’ and
‘King City’.

The inaugural FELIX Demo Dump
which swirled with her throughout
the eight minute long rave that was
‘Fueiho Boogie’. The crowd tripped
out to this utterly awesome and
eccentric performance, and was
finally calmed down at the end of
the set by the slower-paced anthems
of ‘She Changes The Weather’ and
‘To My Brother’. Throughout the
show Austin Williams and his band

elcome to FELIX’s
first Demo Dump,
a section which will
hopefully have a
long and controversial future. Last
week we asked you to send in your
demos,and expected to be inundated
with emails from eager musicians
hoping to finally receive recognition
from our esteemed publication.
Unfortunately, creativity is not a
characteristic trait of most Imperial
students and as a result we received
only a single submission. Not a
great start.
Panicked, we’ve had no other
choice but to review Adele’s new
single. Please send in more demos;
there is only so much Adele that
FELIX endure. While the name of
this section might imply otherwise,
not everything featured in the
Demo Dump this week is complete
garbage (although ‘Hello’is certainly
worthy of such a description).
Hello
It’s been 3 years since we last
heard from Adele (2012’s excellent
‘Skyfall’).Her latest single – the first
from her upcoming album 25 – has
seen massive success. It’s already
broken the record for the most
views on a music video in 24-hours,
beating out Taylor Swift’s ‘Bad
Blood’.
We’ve always been mystified by
Adele’s appeal and ‘Hello’ does little
to fix this. No one can deny the
power and range of Adele’s voice

but it feels wasted here on an anti-
climatic, plodding ballad.
We would have been spared
four minutes of monotony if the
person on the other end of Adele’s
flip-phone had just picked up, and
the song could have been avoided
altogether with a simple Facebook
message.
The unimpressive chorus and
bland, repetitive lyrics result in one
of the year’s most unwarranted hits;
the mass hysteria of the mainstream
media is certainly misplaced. If
you’re a fan of Adele (and FELIX
maintained an effortless mash up
of genres (being retro and trippy
at the same time), commanding a
thrilling stage persona not unlike
Joy Division.
Emerging from Birmingham in
2012, with their debut album of
Where The Heaven Are We only being
released in 2013, you could easily
mistake them for a band that has
been around for much longer. Swim
Deep have successfully transformed
from the indie Brit-pop style of
hazy guitars in their debut to a
variety of psychedelic and crazy
rock sounds in their second album
Mothers. With such a unique style
and dedicated fan base, Swim Deep
aren’t far from becoming a bright
star in this new age of music.

ignore this review and go back to

Little is known about the
mysterious Sangre Voss, the alias of
a mildly-talented Imperial student,
other than that his name translates
to “blood voss” in Spanish (thanks
Google). It seems like anyone can
be an electronic producer these
days; all it takes is a few button

presses, a SoundCloud account
and a few cheeky samples for
good measure. The track features a
relatively simple beat, infused with
delightful panpipes. At its halfway
point growling synths make way
for Sangre Voss’ nasal tones which
sound eerily similar to Joe Newman
of alt-J. Here at FELIX we rarely
expect to be impressed by amateurs,
but, Sangre Voss’ latest track is
surprisingly good for a producer
probably working from his bedroom.
