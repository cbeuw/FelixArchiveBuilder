My period is not a luxury
Hundreds of male MPs vote to continue charging women for having vaginas

A
s a student, the list of
items I would define as
“luxury” is quite long.
Branded chocolate, new
razors, shoes without holes in – for
all these things there is a feasible, if
less appealing, alternative.
So, when HMRC classify sanitary
products as part of this list, what
alternative could they possibly have
in mind?
The rules surrounding VAT (Value
Added Tax) are bizarre to say the
least. On the whole, VAT is meant
to be a tax on items that people don’t
absolutely need, but buy to increase
their quality of life above a standard
level. It follows that there are some
things that are classed as essential,
and are subject to no VAT at all.
The list of items deemed essential
enough to avoid VAT is extensive,
and includes such necessities as
sandwiches (but only if they’re cold),
nuts (if the shells aren’t removed)
and biscuits (unless, god forbid,
they’re chocolate-covered).
Also on the list are incontinence
pads; this one is understandable, as
not-wetting-yourself-everywhere
seems like a fairly basic requirement
for a reasonably comfortable life.
You might expect that not-leaking-
menstrual-fluid-everywhere would
hold similar status. Apparently not.
Currently, sanitary products count
as ‘non essential luxury items’, and
are subject to a VAT rate of 5%.
This has already been reduced from
17.5% in 2001 after a campaign
under Brown’s Labour government,
but the question remains: why is it
not 0%?
At the time the initial reduction
was announced, it was not possible
to reduce it to zero because of certain
EU regulations. On Monday, a vote
was held in the House of Commons
on the proposal to negotiate the
matter with the EU, and was
defeated 305-287.
In the flurry of commentaries
following it, there seems to be one
common theme in support of the
result: there are more important
things to be worrying about.
While I understand this to some
extent – 5% is hardly a huge burden
on the buyer – it is the principle of
the thing that has made people so
irate.
It is inarguably a tax that charges
women for managing a bodily
function they do not choose to
have, and the fact that MPs voted
against getting rid of it is far more
disturbing than the tax itself.
VAT rules are weird anyway, and
5% isn’t that much – but the message
that the House of Commons has
sent with this vote is clear: equality
is just not that important.

here are many things that
irritate me more than my
chafing thighs, but this
week’s focus, Halloween,
gets more on my tits than Dr Eva
Carneiro did on Jose Mourinho’s.
From jack-o(ff)-lanterns, to shit-
o’-treating, this hyper-popular
Americanism grates on me more
than a dry shave in the heat of
summer, and here’s why.
Firstly, in my day, chomping
choccie from ‘Uncle Ian’up the road
set alarm bells ringing. The stranger
danger fear was real,but now,on the
glorious Ocotber the 31st
, kids are
set lose on the streets, like dweebs at
ASDA on Black Friday, to scavenge
the best collection of teeth-rotting
and insulin-spiking confections.
The logic behind this genuinely
blows my mind. I mean, do all the
creeps refrain from spiking their
sweets on one day of the year or
something? I THINK NOT. Yes,
I am a massive cynic, and yes, this
fear is synonymous with paranoia,
but would you use Kanye’s music
as medicine, just because he once
said they were the same thing? No,
unless you’ve got man-flu, in which
case, only Yeezy can help you get
over it, you pathetic, sniffily melt.
In any case, while I do struggle
with the idea, I appreciate the
sentiment and thus, I’m all set for
handing out Haribo to an already
hyperactive toddler in an Elsa-
from-Frozen costume. But when
a group of 17 year olds, ‘drunk’ on
WKD and indecency, bang on

House of Lords does right thing?
Did the House of Lords overstep the mark in delaying proposed tax credit cuts?

G
eorge Osbourne’s new
favourite line to describe
the Conservatives is
“the party of working
people”. Over the last three years,
since he was booed at the London
Olympics opening ceremony,
Osbourne has undergone a
transformation, reinventing himself
as a person and a politician.
He’s lost two stone to try to
improve his public image, widened
his political vocabulary to include
all kinds of clever political spiel and
tried to re-brand the Conservatives
as a party in the centre of the
spectrum in an effort to close the
political gap between them and
Labour.
But however hard he tries to make
us believe it, the Conservatives can’t
be the party of working people if
they take away money from working
people.
Before the 2015 election, David
Cameron appeared on TV and
stated that if his party won, they
would not cut tax credits, a scheme
introduced by Labour to boost the
salaries of low paid workers and
families.Now they are in power,they
are trying to introduce a cut to tax
credits that will affect two million
working families with children and
low household incomes, something
that directly contradicts another of
Osbourne’s buzzphrases – that he
wants to “make work pay”. £4.4bn
pounds worth of cuts are planned,
with an expected average loss to
families (with children) of £1000
each in the year 2020.
The plan isn’t just unpopular with
Labour and the Liberal Democrats,
it has even caused a schism in
Osbourne’s own party.
As of Monday, the House of
Lords has joined in too, voting to
delay Osborne’s proposed cuts, and
complete a more thorough assess
ment of their impact. The House of
Lords hasn’t done this in 100 years
and some senior Conservatives are
up in arms that an unelected body of
peers can overturn their proposals.
While the House of Lords is
outdated and needs reforming, I
think that in this case, they have
done the right thing.The Lords may
be unelected, but this part of the
Conservatives’ election campaign
was a lie. And of course, they’re
getting all the bad news out of the
way now in the hope that it will all
be forgotten by 2020.
The argument against tax credits
is that they effectively subsidise
companies who don’t pay their
employees a high enough wage.
While there may be an element of
truth to that, this is not the way to
go about reforming the situation.
In trying to justify Osbourne’s tax
credit cuts and reform to the system,
Boris Johnson said that he “hopes”
more companies will sign up to the
London living wage. What kind of
a reform is one that takes money
away from working people and
relies on “hope” to give it back?

You’ll look
disgusting,
but on
purpose!
my door, well that just adds insult
to indignity. Go get a job and pay
for your own fucking overpriced
Maoams. Or at least, if you are
going to scavenge for free food on
a kid’s holiday, put some effort in.
Drop the rapper/gangster excuse
for a costume and stop mumbling
trick-o-treat – enunciation can get
you far in this world. That’s how
the Queen’s managed to keep the
throne for so long.
From the under-dressed to the
over, Halloween may as well be
renamed whore-oween, because my
God do some lassies take the Mean
Girls commandment of it being
$60? Almost sold out? Are you fucking kidding me? Photo Credit: BrandsonSale
okay to dress slutty too far. While I
appreciate that if you got it,flaunt it,
being peng doesn’t mean displaying
your red crotch from that brazillian
you had earlier in that skimpy
leopard print leotard.
Seriously ladies, less is genuinely
more, and leaving something for the
imagination is totally empowering.
In fact, my real respect is to those
gals going ghoulish this year, and I
don’t mean a cutesy bit of smudged
lippy. I’m talking about the whole
darn shebang. Go HAM with the
fake blood, face paint and zombie
contact lenses, because this is one
night of the year, where looking
terrifyingly fugly is a-okay. Make
up on Halloween could not be
more fun, because all that delicate
contouring and cat-lining isn’t
required. Hell, put your face on
in the dark, or if you’re really ugly,
don’t bother at all, cuz the end result
will be frightful, and that’s what
the night’s for; scaring away those
cat-fishers. Plus, you won’t lose your
self-esteem the next morning when
you trawl through your snaps – you’ll
look disgusting, but on purpose!
While I could rant ‘til the end of
time, I’ll finish on one last issue; the
true consequences of choosing trick
over treat. Like, WTF will actually
happen? I may have to try it this
year when a BO laden post-GCSE
mug dares to knock on my door.
Don’t bloody shout trick-or-treat
in my face if you’ve not actually
planned a chuckle-worthy prank,
in case I choose the former, you
cretin. Arrogance is up there in my
top three pet hates, (along with full
sized cup-cake shaped cakes and
automatically flushing toilets) and if
you don’t deliver, you have no right
to expect me to.
