CANCER
VIRGO
This week you discover
you have a mouse in your
house and decide to kill it.
Unfortunately your vegan
housemate doesn’t want any
violence towards the vermin,
leading to you having to
eventually sublet a room to
Milford the rat king.

This week you get asked to
do what you assume is the
FELIX centrefold, so you
take your DSLR; however
when you arrive at the studio
where you’re supposed to be
taking it, it turns out Derek
from radio club lured you
under false pretences.
This week you are overjoyed
to spot yourself in ICTV’s
‘Metric Moments’, captured
in the drunken haze of
Freshers’. Alas, when you
go to show all your friends,
the video has disappeared.
Mysterious.
This week you find your
normal route to lectures is
obstructed by some wanker
called Spectre so you decide
to [REDACTED]; however
since you did it in your room,
your hall warden finds out
and you get kicked out and
have to go to UCL.
This week you realize that you
accidentally have been paying
for Amazon Prime ever since
your free student subscription
ran out. You realize that this
explains why that bacon lube
arrived so quickly.
This week you discover
that although bacon may
be a carcinogen, if you
were to become vegan you
would basically be a social
carcinogen and nobody
would really want to spend
time with you so maybe just
live your life.
This week you discover
that taking drugs is not a
way to impress any of your
friends and family; however
being a drug dealer is a very
impressive and lucrative
opportunity. Far more than
you’ll ever earn with your
biochem degree anyway.
This week you realize that
you may have set yourself
on a path for which there is
only misery and very little
reward at the end of it. Yep,
like everyone else you’re in
your second year at Imperial.
Ughhhhhh.
This week you think your
lecture won’t be that
bad; however on closer
inspection, your timetable
is all infectious diseases and
various microbes.That means
you’re going to be seeing a lot
of mouldy dicks.
This week you read the last
horoscope – you know the
one that got sent in by some
student because the editors
[CENSORED]. You don’t
get it,nor do you find it funny.
You are basically everybody
else who read it.
This week following
your protests against the
appearance of the Chinese
President at Imperial, you
start to see other Chinese
students following you
around and whispering
shit about you. You think
they might be plotting your
kidnapping, but it turns out
you’re just racist.
This week you are innocently
driving a minibus, when it
somehow ends up crashing
into the back of some poor
sap’s car. You tell no-one,
hoping that FELIX won’t
find out. We did.
