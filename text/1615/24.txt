mperial College’s handball
club, Imperial Eagles, kicked
off the season taking part in
a one-day tournament which
had a field including University
College London, Kings College
London, Brunel and Middlesex.
For the participating teams the
tournament serves as preparation
for the upcoming league games and
the UK University Championships.
After winning the London
universities league (LUSL) in 2013
and finishing second last season,
the Eagles were also the defending
champions of this tournament,
having beaten UCL in a tough final
last year.
However, it was always going to
be difficult this time round after the

players, who have finished their
studies at Imperial. With the team
in a transitional phase and many
new players signing up to take on
the sport, priority was given to
beginners and first-time players to
build up some game experience.

was played in a round-robin
format where all five teams played
against one another in a series of
15-minute matches. No time-outs
were allowed and the two-minute
suspension penalties were reduced
to one minute. The teams that
finished first and second in the
table then contested the final. In
the women’s competition only two
teams participated playing a full-
length one-hour match.
The Imperial men’s team was
represented by Jakub Szypicyn,
Horia-DanielTigau,Theo Franquet,
Patrik Gubeljak, Mohamed
Koronfel, Benedikt Explicat,
Clement Escolano, Kamil Kurdziel,
Jay Heinen, Alexandr Kirilinko,
Langston Williams, Samuel Rot
and Giovanni Bettinelli. First up
was a Brunel team that arrived short
on players.The Eagles trio of Kamil,
Jay and Langston joined the Brunel
side and were responsible for more
than half of the goals in the 5-3
defeat of the Eagles.
The next game was against a vastly
experienced UCL side that had a
lot of familiar faces from previous
seasons. UCL have been the Eagles’
main challenge in the past but
with their team vastly unchanged
this year, this was a chance for
Eagles have slow start to the season
Imperial’s handball team started with four defeats, but were able to provide beginners
with their first experience in the sport
our fresh side to gain experience
against the toughest opposition in
London. The Eagles rotated players
as much as possible through many
substitutions with everyone getting
a chance to play. The final score was
4-10, a heavy defeat but a valuable
experience for all involved.

Against KCL it was a more even
game and the Eagles took an early
lead before a strong finish from KCL
tested the fitness of the Eagles team
as they succumbed to a third defeat
4-6.With three defeats,any chances
of playing the final diminished
and the Eagles entered the final
game against Middlesex aiming to
put some of what was learnt into
practice. A similar scenario to that
of the previous game unfolded with
the Eagles taking an early lead,
forcing Middlesex to employ their
star man. Scoring four outstanding
goals on his own, he managed to
lead Middlesex to a last gasp 5-4
victory.
The Eagles suffered four defeats
but signs of improvements were
already evident in the last two
games. It became clear that what
this year’s fresh side needs the
most is a few more games together.
Having only managed two training
sessions before this tournament, the
Eagles lacked cohesion in attack
and communication in defence.
The women’s game was a
Middlesex side – one of the best
women’s university teams in the
country – facing a challenge from
a mixed-London universities team.
The mixed-team was represented
by players from UCL (five), KCL
(four) plus Imperial’s Dominika
Kampa.
The game promised a lot on
paper and lived up to expectations
as it remained captivating until its
final moments. The London team
took the lead early on and were
already 5-1 up after 20 minutes,
with Dominika playing a vital role
in goal keeping the opposition
at bay. Middlesex regrouped and
took advantage of some attacking
mistakes by the London team, as
the lead was cut to one goal at 6-5
at half-time. The London team
started the second-half as strongly
as they did in the first,taking a three
goal lead. However an incredible
final 20-minutes performance by
Middlesex turned the game on
its head. The team in white was
unstoppable as they fought back
and took the lead for the first time
in the game, eventually winning the
game by 16-14.
This season is full of uncertainty
but with a few more sessions
together, Imperial’s Eagles could
find the team chemistry desperately
needed to lead this fresh side to
success. They kick off the league
campaign against Brunel on Sunday
25th
at the Copper Box Arena,where
the Olympic handball competitions
took place in 2012.

Baseball Championships,
one of the biggest baseball
tournaments of the year. This time
around it didn’t fail to provide
drama as the Imperial Immigrants
had many tough games but pushed
on through.
The first match of the day was
against London rivals UCL. After
taking the lead with a run in the
first UCL managed to get a few
back due to some solid batting to
take a 4-1 lead but the Immigrants
weren’t going to let them run away
with it. In the top of the second
Imperial had scored three runs and
had the bases loaded with only one
out when baseball veteran but newly
Immigrated Luke Looney hit a long
ballpastcentrefieldforanimpressive
Grand Slam, immediately ending
the inning on the mercy rule with
two outs to spare. The game was far
from over though as UCL were not
going to go down without a fight,
scoring another three runs in the net
inning to bring the score to 8-7. It
all came down to a nerve wrecking
final inning and as the away team
the immigrants had to survive an
inning without conceding. Easier
said than done, especially when
there was the tying run on third;
winning at second,and only one out.
One strikeout later the pressure was
eased but only slightly. UCL’s next
batter managed to make contact but
some good fielding allowed for a
forced out to end the game.
The second game provided no less
dramaasImperialtooktheearlylead,
but Nottingham somehow managed
to minimise the gap and started the
last inning three runs away from the
tie. After scoring two in the bottom
of the last inning they looked like
they would be able to upset the
Immigrants, but Immigrants don’t
give up so easily. Again with the
tying run on third with two outs the
tensions were high, but more again
the Immigrants held on for the win.
The final game of the group stage
was also a close one against UEA,
and while Imperial had taken the
early lead they couldn’t quite hold
L
ast Saturday saw the
Immortals’ three-way
scrimmage against Solent
and Brunel.The Immortals
were hungry for some contact after
many intense training sessions.
The day started off with each
university’s offensive team going
up against each defensive team for
ten plays before switching around.
This was followed by a round robin
scrimmage and the day ended with
special teams undergoing specific
scenarios. Despite some players
being inexperienced, the defensive
team were strong and held off the
hard-hitting Brunel and Solent
offense.
Shout outs go out to our rookie
D-end ‘angry’ Matthieu Raymond
and our rookie linebacker Matt ‘has
had enough’ Blackett for making
tackles all over the field including,
notably, a filthy Quarterback sack
by Raymond. Even though there
were some hotheaded moments,
veterans “I’ve got a hot girlfriend”
Rayane Jackson, Jack “Bamiiiiii”
Codrey and Henry ‘Ugly Henners’
Turner landed many successful hits
on the line opening up gaps for Alex
Hutcherson to once again throw his
body into running backs much like
an averaged sized salmon jumping
upstream against a waterfall.
The aforementioned veterans
however, courageously guided the
Immortals put

paces Jiacheng Wang

on for a third victory. In the end the
Immigrants still booked their place
in the semi finals.
Returning on Sunday afternoon
the Immigrants faced off against
a strong Loughborough side who
played some good baseball and
some solid left handed pitching.
Although Imperial made some
solid contact and got a few hits in
it wasn’t enough to overcome the
would-be champions.
In the final match of the
tournament the Immigrants had
a different idea. Playing for third
wasn’t going to ruin the afternoon
for those who wanted to just enjoy
themselves, so that’s exactly what
they did against Nottingham, a
team they had already defeated the
day before. After team newcomer
but baseball veteran Aíd pitched the
first couple of innings things were
switched up for the third where
the positions were played around
with so players could experiment

are a force to
be reckoned
with
front seven with their determination
and restlessness and set a strong
pace for the defence overall.
Lastly, a mention to Wibbly
Wobbly Will Coidan’s overly
ambitious and not so spectacular
Nodell leading to the opposing
team’s interception. This was not
made right by his sack on one of
our own, Marin ‘wet burp’ Tuleu,
after an outstanding interception,
leading the opposing team’s fumble
recovery.
On the other hand, the offensive
team started off slowly with a few
mistakes here and there but picked
up towards the end. The offensive
line were landing solid blocks,which
led to strong contributions from our
rookie wide receiver, modest Race
Kilian, including, most notably, his
sneaky reception in double coverage.
Special thanks to Papa Noach for
finding his inner Zen during a sticky
situation between Le’Bami Falana
and Brunel’s sideline. Despite
the tension, Falana continued to
dominate the grounds after scoring
touchdown after touchdown
during special team drills. Finally
on offense, Married Man Markus
Mohr made a few above average
plays too.
All in all, a great day for the
Immortals with the rookies gaining
a lot of experience and the returners
going back into the game, we now
look forward to playing against
a strong Birmingham side this
Saturday.

on other parts of the field. Zayd, the
team’s third baseman, was given his
pitching debut while Stephane tried
his hand at first base. The entire
team was playing out of position
for what would be two of the most
enjoyable innings of UK baseball,
even despite the confusion of some
players in both dugouts. There was
even a contender for play of the
tournament when second baseman
Min made an incredible diving stop
to force the runner out at first to
end the inning.The game eventually
ended, but not before Zayd got his
first strikeout.
While Nottingham may have won
on paper the real winners were the
Imperial Immigrants for making
the most of the day and enjoying
the game for what it is. Well done
to the team who had some old
faces but many new. President and
captain Zack has started a great year
alongside the very talented team
GM Eduardo. Newcomer Alvaro
did not fail to impress with some
solid hitting, even getting a triple
in one of the games, and Yuki who
brought experience into the field to
command first base like a pro.
The first of many, the fall
tournament showed a team, who
had just been assembled a couple
of days before, displaying their true
spirit and it will only get better with
practice. Watch out because the
Imperial Immigrants are a force to
be reckoned with.

season strongly
