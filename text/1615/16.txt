T
his summer, we
volunteered with
Imperial College Aid to
the Balkans (ICAB) at
an orphanage in Veliko Tarnovo,
the old capital of Bulgaria, home to
some of the most symbolic historical
sites in the country. During our
time there, we spent our time with
children of all ages, learning about
the culture of Veliko Tarnovo and
Bulgaria, and exploring the sights
that they had to offer. Primarily, our
role was simply to spend time with
the children, and to enjoy the two
weeks at the orphanage.
We were greeted with outstanding
eagerness by the orphans, who
have had previous experience with
volunteers such as ourselves, and
were ready to play the moment
we arrived. The majority of the
children preferred to play outside
in the garden, choosing from a
variety of swings, trampolines and
climbing frames. Not once did the
energetic demands of the kids cease
during our time there; they were
always keen on having us carry
them around on piggyback, or play
football, or even being used as rope
to play tug of war with. Such an
exhaustive workload was satiated
only by a series of afternoon naps,
which provided a small glimmer
of peace, before we returned to the
relentless spirit of the kids.
Throughout the course of this
experience, we found that we were
often alone in looking after the kids;
a lack of enthusiasm for supervision
was reflected in the attitudes of
most of the staff. This was seen
when the excitement of the children
turned into a brutal combination of
hair-pulling, stone-throwing and
punching. Nonetheless, the orphans
showed us an extraordinarily
vivid ensemble of personalities.
Everyone had their own unique
interests and aspirations; some
saw themselves as rappers, others
as footballers, and even a few as
doctors. The orphanage was host to
an atmosphere of closeness between
the children, who shared food and
clothes with each other every day.
We encountered an amazing level
of creativity, expressed through a
variety of means, including making
flowers with beads and being rapped
at in Bulgarian.
On our days off, we explored the
many sights of Veliko Tarnovo, of
which the most significant were
the medieval Tsarevets fortress and
the monument of Assens. In our
attempts to find the latter, we found
ourselves unable to effectively use
a map, regardless of the collective
geographical qualifications of the
group. Having explored for what
felt like days, we somehow, through
what was undoubtedly a miracle,
eventually found our way to the
monument, a dedication to the
reign of 3 Bulgarian Kings under
whom the medieval Bulgarian
state reached its pinnacle. We also
explored the imposing Tsarevets

We bet your summer wasnâ€™t this good
fortress, the stronghold and primary
fortress of the Second Bulgarian
Empire. Although we nearly gave
up during our many attempts to
reach the summit, unfortunately
more due to laziness than fatigue,,
we eventually reached the top where
the ruins of the Palace emerged.The
religious foundation of Bulgarian
culture was apparent from the
start of our journey, with several
churches and monasteries situated
throughout the city, including the
Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy
Cathedral of Alexander Nevsky in Sofia. Photo Credit: Kushan Sen

Bulgaria truly offered us an
amazing volunteering time.
Working with the orphans for the
two weeks was an unparalleled
experience, and is something we
will never forget. The country itself
is abound with rich history and
culture that deserves to be explored
by all. We hope others will consider
volunteering with ICAB, so that
they too can have as remarkable a
journey.
Definitely a better view than from your sofa. Photo Credit: Kushan Sen
