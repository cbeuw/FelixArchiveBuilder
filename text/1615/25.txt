THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON

CURFC’s 1st
team started
their season with a bang,
dispatching recently-
promoted Medway 37-0. The
match ran with Imperial College
dominating from the start, with
big collisions recurrent within the
opening encounters. This resulted
in Imperial going ahead early from
a penalty, slotted majestically and
somewhat surprisingly by Charles
Price-Smith. With Imperial
camped out on the Medway line,
Club Captain and number 10 for
the day, Charles Price-Smith, fired
a dubious double-miss pass out to
the towering wing, Josh O’Donnell,
allowing him to dot down for the
opening try of the match.
Imperial consistently capitalised
on Medway indiscipline at the break
down, taking field position and
utilising the customary strong line-
out plays to inevitably construct a
mall on the opposition line, quickly
driving over twice in succession,
with both trys being scored by
number 8, and the humble author
of this report,Tom Hedley.
Play then broke up with Chris
MacBeth threatening the Medway
defence. Captain Dave Nielsen-
Scott carried well before being
swiftly inverted by the opposition
and mixed like the human martini
that he is. Luckily for Imperial
the captain appeared to have been
stirred rather than shaken by the
experience, going on to carry the
ball 50 meters later in the game
only for the ball to die a death in
the hands of Carlos Sheppard.
In the second-half Imperial
fell foul to a string of penalties,
resulting in the illustrious Honorary
Secretary Tom Hobson receiving
his first ever yellow card. He took
the compulsory 700 push-ups fine
imposed by our more old-fashioned
South African coach in good spirit,
and his pectorals will thank him for
it eventually.
Ed Durkin proceeded to take hold
of the game using his tactical kicking
to put his team in all the right
places, taking a black eye at some
point in the process, which he later
used to impress his girlfriend, so the
rumours say, with stories of heroics.
Capitalising on this, Tom Hedley
(deserved man-of-the-match and
quite frankly playing in a league far
below his ability) scored two tries in
quick succession. One from broken
play handing off the fullback, and
the other acting as the beneficiary
at the end of a well-worked backs
move, with the winger trusting in
Hedley’s deceptive footwork over
his own. This brought his try total
for the game to a staggeringly
impressive four tries. Four.
Thanks to a united front row of
Nathan Tomlinson – who will be
delighted to tell you that his heart-
rate is so low because he is ‘so fit’
(his doctor will corroborate it, he
promises) – Tom Hobson and Jon
Lineham; Imperial’s dominance at
scrum time allowed them to work
an 8, 9, 15 wing move, culminating
with Josh O’Donnell going in to
score his second in the corner.
Imperial withstood the weakened
attacks of Medway in the closing
minutes, holding on to their clean
sheet and securing the first of what
is sure to be many wins in the season
to come.

But fail to make it two out of two
A
fter a convincing 37-0
win at home to Medway
two weeks ago, the first
team of ICURFC were
confident going into what was going
to be one of the toughest games of
the season, safe in the knowledge
that they came equipped with the
only Scholarship Athlete for rugby
in the history of scholarships at
Imperial, and the humble author
of this report, Joe McGrail. After
a long two hour journey and some
handy minibus manoeuvres from
O’Donnell, Imperial were left with
only a short period of time to warm
up before the game was underway.
The conditions were poor and
from the off both teams were
making numerous unforced errors,
failing to string together any phases.
This appeared to be the general
theme throughout what was a very
sloppy game. Canterbury adapted
more quickly to the conditions and
began to play a very tight game
trying to keep the ball in hand.
Imperial’s defence stood strong, and
by defence we mean the chop tackles
that literally brought Canterbury to
their knees demonstrating that the
rugby scholarship was well earned.
However, a lapse in concentration
sawmissedtacklesastheCanterbury
outside centre broke the line and
went on to score the only try of the
game. Despite the poor conditions
Charles Price-Smith kicked well
from the tee keeping imperial
within a score of Canterbury.
The majority of the game followed
in a similar fashion moving from
scrum to scrum with the Imperial
front row’s fitness began to show
as Canterbury were shoved back,
and the last 10 minutes finally saw
Imperial begin to play some good
rugby in the opposition 22. The fast
approaching full time whistle gave
Joe McGrail
Rugby
Imperial’s attack a sense of urgency,
after being held up twice and
coming within inches of the line,the
pressure eventually eased as Imperial
lost possession to good defence by
Canterbury. A disappointing end to
a disappointing performance.
There were some positives to take
away from the game, a particular
mention to Tom Hobson who
despite the wet slippery conditions
threw excellently, allowing the
Imperial line-out to operate as
The players

to come
normal unlike the Canterbury line-
out which became restricted to only
the front half due to the conditions.
This allowed the forwards to launch
some dangerous mauls and secure
possession in an area of the game
where Canterbury were failing to
do so. Also a mention to fullback
Alex Hawkings and scrum-half Ed
Durkin who showed good attacking
intent and giving imperial some go
forward from running back kick
returns and playing some clever
chips through respectively.
This weekend will be put behind
us and the players made it quite
clear that there will not be a repeat
of this performance in the season
to come. If there is, a Scholarship
Athlete has promised to use his
scholarship to ply the South
African coach with a year’s supply
of his favourite homeland delicacy,
Boerewors, to distract him from the
many hundreds of push-ups that he
threatens to bestow upon the team.
