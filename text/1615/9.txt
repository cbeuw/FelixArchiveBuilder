f you happened to chance
upon a newspaper other than
FELIX this week (and let’s
be honest why would you),
you’d have noticed that our lovely
staples of bacon, ham and sausages
have been given the loving media
stamp of ‘cancer causing’. This was
expectedly sensationalised, with The
Guardian and The Telegraph joining
in to scare the bacon and sausage
bap right out of your mouth.
“Bacon, burgers and sausages are
as big a cancer threat as cigarettes”,
“Processed meat ranks alongside
smoking as a major cause of cancer”
and “Processed meats pose same
cancer risk as smoking and asbestos,
reports say”.
As the nation mourns the new WHO classification of bacon, sausages and ham as
‘cancer causing’, FELIX prescribes a course of chill pills

n 2014, almost 200 heart
transplants were carried out
in the UK alone. However,
the British Heart Foundation
estimates that over 1,200 people in
need of a heart transplant die every
year. In the mid-1990s, over 250
heart transplants took place each
year, but that number has steadily
decreased as fewer suitable hearts
were made available.
Now, researchers at Carnegie
Mellon University have
demonstrated a new technique
that allows soft tissue to effectively
be 3D printed. Bioprinting, the
technique of layering cells to ‘print’
an organic object, has been around
for about a decade. However, up ‘til
now, the soft materials it created
tended to collapse under their
own weight. This new research,
published in the journal Science
Advances, eliminates the problem
and pioneers a technique that prints
the biological tissues in a gelatin
solution, which provides structural
support. Adam Feinberg, one of
the authors of the study, explained:
“Essentially, we print on gel inside
of another gel, which allows us to
accurately position the soft material
as it’s being printed, layer-by-
layer.” This gel is thermoreversible,
meaning it will melt when brought
up to body temperature, allowing
the printed materials to be removed
without damaging the molecules.

t seems like Russia is one step
closer to being nicknamed
the control-freak state. Now,
scientists have been instructed
to run all research manuscripts by
the national security service before
submitting research to journals and
conferences, as revealed by minutes
from a Belozersky Institute meeting.
Of course, like in the case of
most countries, Russian laws have
been in place for decades to control
military research or even industrial
significance. However, last spring,
a decree was passed by President
Vladimir Putin to include more
or less any research in the ‘in need
of security service approval’ list.
Research that needs such approval
includes anything that comes under
the blanket term ‘new products’.

Looks like everyone’s favourite,
bacon and asbestos roll is off the
college café menu now.
This week, the World Health
Organisation (WHO) issued long
awaited new guidelines placing
processed meat in Category 1, or
‘causes cancer’. It also placed red
meat (beef, pork and lamb) in
Category 2a, or ‘probably causes
cancer’. For clarification, “processed
meat” means anything that has been
treated to extend shelf life or modify
taste. Sadly, that does include bacon
and sausages.
To a certain extent this isn’t news.
The classification was coordinated
by the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC),
which examined over 800 published
studies on the link between cancer
and processed meat.
Unfortunately the new
classification for processed meat as
‘causes cancer’ means it joins 118
other substances that, based on
sufficient evidence, cause cancer.
And yes, that list does also include
asbestos, cigarettes, smokeless
tobacco and alcohol.
Professor David Philips from
Cancer Research UK made a
essentially means is that IARC
isn’t in the business of telling us
how potent something is in causing
cancer – just whether it does or
not. Take the analogy of banana
skins, for example. They can cause
accidents,but in practice this doesn’t
happen very often (unless you work
in a banana factory). And the sort of
harm you can come to from slipping
on a banana skin is generally not as
severe as,say,being in a car accident.
But under a hazard identification
system like IARC’s, ‘banana skin’
and ‘cars’ would come under that
same category – they both definitely
do cause accidents.”
What is important is to
understand what is meant by risk.
The conflation of the IARC classing
processed meat as ‘causes cancer’
and newspaper headlines claiming
they are “as a big a cancer threat” as
smoking is completely misleading
and unacceptable.
So before we start making people
eat bacon sandwiches outside
the pub in the rain or labelling
packets with ‘sausages kill’, we
need to examine the actual risk to
health. The IARC has said that
consuming 50g of processed meat a
day increases your risk of colorectal
cancer by 18%, whereas smoking
poses a much greater risk to public
health, as clearly shown by the
cancer research UK infographic.
The only similarity is that studies
have shown both cause cancer.
So the final question is: Should we
stop eating red meat and processed
meat? Professor Key from CRUK
and University of Oxford says “the
decision doesn’t mean you need to
stop eating any red and processed
meat,but if you eat lots of it you may
want to think about cutting down.
Eating a bacon bap every once in a
while isn’t going to do much harm
– having a healthy diet is all about
moderation.”
So no, eating bacon and red
meat does not pose the same risk
as smoking. Looks like the old-
fashioned rule rings clear and true
– staying healthy is all about a
balanced diet and moderation.

provides a foundation upon which
whole, functioning organs can be
manufactured from a patient’s own
cells in the future. Bespoke organs
are still some way off, but the team
is already looking to add further
complexity to their bioprinted
structures.“What we’re trying to do
now is to try and incorporate cardiac
is not merely burdensome for
scientists, but as some point out,
could be bad for science.
Scientists could become reluctant
to share or even openly talk about
myocytes, which are heart muscle
cells, into those tissue constructs as
we’re printing them,” says Feinberg.
Nevertheless, the team is already
beginning to produce structures that
could be used to repair damaged
hearts, negating the need for a
transplant altogether.
Remarkably, the team was able to
achieve this by using a consumer-
level 3D printer. They further
utilised open-source hardware and
software to improve efficiency and
lower costs.“We have access to fine-
tune the print parameters, optimise
what we’re doing, and maximise
the quality of what we’re printing,”
Feinberg said.
The boom in recent years in
collaborative, open-source projects
has greatly improved scientists’
accessibility to the tools they need
to conduct their research. Indeed,
we can expect to see rapid advances
in biotechnology.
Faced with an aging population,
the demand for new hearts, and
other organs, isn’t going away.
Even with conventional transplant
surgery,around half of the recipients
of new hearts die within ten years.
Furthermore, suitable hearts may
be difficult to source, as they need
to be biologically compatible with
the recipient. Improved bioprinting
technologies could eliminate these
problems, prolonging lifespans and
preventing needless deaths.
An increase
in sanctions
and
controls is
causing the
brightest to
leave
their science, especially if it is seen
as work that in any way criticizes
the government.
In a recent interview, Sergey
Salikhov, director of the Russian
Science Ministry’s science and
technology department (purposely
made a mouthful to deter journalists
from contacting him), reassured
Nature that the decree would not
be interfering with ‘’basic science”.
Then again, you could argue that no
one can really interfere with ‘’basic
science’’ without access to a time
machine and Sir Isaac Newton’s
address, because really, research
nowadays is anything but basic.
But if this new move for secrecy
is so bad, where is the outcry from
the Russian scientific community?
Viachev Shuper of the Russian
Academy of Sciences claims that
many Russian scientists “don’t
dare to speak openly, but I know
that many are very unhappy about
the degradation of their academic
freedom”.
This might explain the recent
brain drain some say Russia has
been going through. According
to data published by the Russian
Federal Statistics Service (Rosstat),
in the first eight months of 2014,
approximately 204,000 people
emigrated from Russia. According
to emigration consultant Sergei
Kuznetsov,themajorityofemigrants
are middle and upper-middle class.
An increase in sanctions and
government controls is causing
the countries ‘’brightest minds in
finance and technology’’ to take
flight, as highlighted by Bloomberg
Business last year.
Many of the country’s big
companies are moving staff and
headquarters to more liberal
environments, where they can
operate more freely. The list includes
Game Insight LCC, Toonbox
animation studio and VKontakte.
What’s more, the government’s
leash only seems to be getting
shorter. Now that science
institutions across the country
are trying to impose controls on
research staff, perhaps we will see a
new wave of emigration as scientists
follow the lead of Russia.
