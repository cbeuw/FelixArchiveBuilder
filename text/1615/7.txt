ounded in just 2001, the
Movie Comic Media Expo
Group (MCM) organizes
all the major conventions
in the UK. Although it hosts similar
gatherings across the Midlands,
Scotland,and Ireland,the jewel in its
crown has always been the biannual
London MCM ComicCon. The
event attracts more than 120,000
visitors over the weekend, making
it one the biggest gatherings of its
kind in Europe.

It’s sheer
madness, but
delightful.
down the country, but I have a soft
spot for MCM because of the huge
variety of stuff that’s on offer across
genres and media. It’s not every
day you get to see promo material
for the release of the latest Persona
game or Assassins’ Creed coexisting
in the same hall, alongside a pewter
cast of Han Solo in carbonite or
a panel with Rooster Teeth (of
RWBY and Red vs Blue fame).
You’ve got amateur and semi-
professional artists peddling their
wares on one end, big name stalls
on the other end, and a chance to
take photos with The Walking Dead
Malaysia, which had oodles on
offer; the MCM cons, however, are
another beast altogether. I’ve gone
from someone who first started
casually dressing up as hipster Ariel
last Halloween to doing a full-
blown live-action game cosplay
this October. This year I saw an
Altair (Assassins’ Creed) cosplayer
play dead on the floor after yelling
out “DESYNCHRONIZED!”,
and a Deadpool cosplayer yelling
for “Todd (Haberkorn)-senpai” to
notice him whilst pretending to cut
a meet and greet queue. It’s sheer
madness, but delightful.
T
he first time I attended
MCM London was
the summer convention
in May this year. I was
immediately struck at the vibrancy,
the buzz, and above all, how
incredibly happy and overwhelmed
I was by the sheer number of people
that had also decided to join me,and
how these events bring us together.
There are all sorts of cons all year
round in London, let alone up and
zombies or in the Back To The
Future DeLorean machine in yet
another corner of the hall.
It’s also amazing how many con
virgins later on end up becoming
avid cosplayers as a result. My
first ever comic con was back in
in the two-hour queue outside
the London ExCeL building at
9am waiting to be the first in to
see their favourite celebrity. Even
this doesn’t take into account the
social integration of people from
extremely diverse backgrounds,
drawn from across the world by their
mutual love of art and design. The
visual communication of comics
and costumes permeates language
barriers. People are unilaterally
welcomed into the community.
Even to a mainstream media lover,
the appeal is clear. Daniel Radcliffe
was one of the celebrities making an
appearance this time last year, while
Stephen Moffat and Mark Gatiss
of Sherlock and Doctor Who hosted
a writer’s panel. Members of the
public rushed to take photographs
with representatives from The
Walking Dead and Game of Thrones.
For someone with an open mind
towards art, the convention’s Comic
Village is an area specifically
dedicated to professional artists,
publishers, and designers. Works
displayed this year ranged from
One Piece, a popular fantasy pirate
manga, with accompanying anime
seriesandfeaturefilms;tomoreniche
independentworksandadultcomics.
The existence of platforms
like ComicCon adds a well-
received splash of creativity to
London. It is not only of great
benefit to the local community,
but is a social achievement to be
celebrated, serving as inspiration to
designers, creators, and the people
everywhere who enjoy their work.
For those of us who have grown
up after the developments of the
information age, it is inconceivable
that enthusiasts once had to make
long trips to the only city in the
country which had the shop
hosting the designs or collections
they wanted. And consider the
video game industry, designers and
artists, and film stars and celebrities,
who also benefit from this strange
kind of global integration. The vast
economic benefit is indisputably
clear – especially to anyone stuck
Geek culture’s sudden explosion in
popularity has not gone unnoticed in
industry. From 2002 to 2013, profits
from the distribution of Japanese
animation alone increased from
¥0.2bn to ¥34bn. Each individual
convention is an opportunity for
developers and designers from
all over the world to have their
work celebrated. Moreover, these
events are emotionally charged,
with visitors often spending
months designing costumes
solely for the sake of a weekend.
