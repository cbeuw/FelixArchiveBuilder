New Bond film premieres on our doorstep
M
onday brought the
world premiere of
the 24th
James Bond
film, Spectre, to the
Royal Albert Hall.
Princes Harry and William, and
the Duchess of Cambridge, joined
stars Daniel Craig, Sam Mendes
and Naomie Harris to saunter down
the red carpet on Prince Consort
Road. They passed Beit Quad and
the Blackett building on their way,
while students and staff were glued
to the windows, trying to get a
glimpse of the famous faces.
SeveralImperialstudentsmanaged
to get away with mementoes of the
evening, including selfies hanging
over the barrier of the red carpet
and signed posters, with one cheeky
hall of residence managing to nab
the huge poster of 007 and latest
Bond girl, Léa Seydoux, from the
bottom of the RAH stairs.

Several Imperial
academics to boycott
Israeli universities
O
n Tuesday, a letter
pledging an ‘academic
boycott’ of Israeli
universities was
published in The Guardian, signed
by 343 lecturers including three
from Imperial.
The full page spread was entitled
‘A Commitment by UK Scholars
to the rights of Palestinians’ and
featured the names and institutions
of each signatory.
The three Imperial academics
featured are Professor Sir Thomas
Kibble, a theoretical physics
Emeritus professor, Professor
Dot Griffiths, former Dean of
the Business school and currently
the Provost’s Envoy for Gender
Equality, and Dr Bucker Dangor,
a senior research investigator from
Physics.
Although only signing the letter
in a personal capacity, the professors
on the list vow not to work with or
visit Israeli universities, or attend
events sponsored or organised by
them.The academics say the boycott

Editor-in-Chief
is down to Israeli institutions being
“deeply complicit” in the nation’s
“violations of international law”.
However, there is an assurance that
ties shouldn’t be cut with individual
Israeli colleagues.
Professor Dot told FELIX she’d
signed the letter because of the
Israeli shelling of a UN school in
July 2014, in Gaza, which killed 15.
“Given the history of the Jewish
people, Israel’s continuing violation
of Palestinian human rights is
bewildering, saddening and, to me,
unjustified.”
By Wednesday, 160 additional
academics had signed up, taking
the number of signatories to 500.
Organisers say they have not
updated their website since then,
due to the “flood of signatures”
they’ve recieved since publication.
In February, SOAS’ student union
voted in favour of a ‘full academic
boycott’ of Israel, including a
complete disassociation from the
Israeli Hebrew University. The
motion passed with 75% of the
student vote.
In 2013, Stephen Hawking pulled
out of a conference in Israel, after
pleas from Palestinian colleagues.
Hawking is yet to sign the current
letter.
Both Britain’s and Israel’s
governments have criticised the
letter, with both embassies quick
to release statements condemning
it. The British ambassador to Israel
said the boycott would not stop “60
years worth of vibrant exchange”
between the two countries, with
the Israeli embassy saying such
movements only promoted “hatred
and alienation”.
In February, a similar open letter
calling for a “cultural boycott” of
Israel was signed by several notable
figures from the art world, and
again published in The Guardian.
It was met with a reponse letter
from slightly more notable figures,
including JK Rowling, saying the
crisis would be solved by “bridges
not boycotts.”
The letter
was signed
by 343
lecturers,

three from
