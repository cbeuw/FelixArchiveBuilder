W
hen you aren’t
feeling perfectly
happy and
motivated – and
let’s face it, often that state of mind
feels pretty much mythical – being
productive can be a challenge.
Whether you’re feeling down
because you’ve not had enough
sleep, you’ve been diagnosed with
depression, or your anxiety is
crippling your ability to do work,
there are some techniques and
resources that can be really helpful.
There is a tendency among
those who are at Imperial to be
perfectionists and, while this can be
an incredibly useful trait, it can end
up being a downfall. When you feel
a bit down it is tempting to write off
any attempts you make if they’re not
immediately perfect.
Depression makes it hard to
find any motivation because you’re
convinced nothing you do will be
good enough. Anxiety can make
you feel so worried that you won’t
do well enough that you conclude
you should instead do nothing at
all, because at least then you won’t
run the risk of failing after having
actually tried.
I’ve experienced all these feelings,
and they create a cycle that makes it
incredibly difficult to get out of.The
more deadlines that approach or the
more that you miss, the harder it
is to think you should even bother
trying.
But, when you think about it
logically rather than emotionally,
just attempting a problem sheet is
better than nothing at all. It might
not be perfect, but at least you can
get a score rather than nothing.
Making an attempt lets you start
the process of reaching out for help.
Doing this depends on your
individual situation and can be
anything from chatting to your
tutor or peers to let them know
you’re feeling off and might need
some extra help, to seeking out
counselling from the IC Health
Centre or Student Service.Reaching
out to let others help you is an
invaluable step to breaking a vicious
cycle. However, there are also things
you can do to kick-start yourself on
the road to productivity.
Firstly, recognising that
something is better than nothing
and scheduling your day accordingly
can work wonders. There are many
ways you can do this but assigning
tasks to each day and being able
to cross them off gives a sense of
accomplishment that proves very
motivating.
Looking up ‘how to bullet journal’
online throws up many resources
showing how you might make
one that works for you. Bullet
journaling is a technique that can be
personalised, and centres typically
around a tailored day planner.
Another timetabling resource
I have found helpful in the past
is an online system and app
called HabitRPG. It allows you to
essentially play a game where you
gain money and stats within the
game by completed tasks you have
assigned yourself in real life.
When following the timings you
have given yourself remember not to
work yourself for too long or you’ll
lose concentration far too swiftly.
A useful method is called ‘The
Pomodoro Technique’. This is a
when you focus on working for
25 minutes, then have a five-
minute break. Repeat this cycle
up to four times before you take a
long break of maybe half an hour.
Again, searching this online yields
a more detailed explanation of the
principles behind it.
During the 25 minute sessions
of concentrated working, I find it
useful to use the Self-control app
which allows you to ban yourself
from certain websites for a specified
length of time.
There is also a browser add-
on called Simple Pomodoro that
automatically blocks sites for the
required 25 minutes. It is a good
way to prevent aimlessly wandering
around on social media, or going
down into the deep dark depths
of YouTube (which happens to me
embarrassingly frequently).
Finally, remembering to keep
your life well-balanced is a very
important step to keeping yourself
happy and on-track, if not perfectly
motivated. Consider going for a
short walk during one of your study
breaks, and writing down and using
some self-care options or activities
Procrastination vs. Productivity
you find relaxing to help you wind
down.
Above all, don’t beat yourself up
for not managing to be perfectly
productive each day; some days you
just need to congratulate yourself
for the small things. Getting out
of bed, remembering to shower, or
making yourself some warm food is
an achievement in itself, especially
when you’re experiencing anxiety or
depression.
So keep it going, and use
everything you can to help yourself
get back on your feet. Life and work
can be tough, but you are tougher!
