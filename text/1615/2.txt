Y
es, we’re back again, and
every week I’m a little
amazed that we are. Of
course, we’ve gone in
on the whole Bond thing – but
what did you expect? Craig and
co shimmying down a red carpet
right next to our beloved union is
something that weathered Imperial
individuals like me will recognise
now as something that happens
every three years.
Even if you’re not into 007 and
his questionable ethics, which we
discuss in the film section on page
24, you can read an interview with
the enthusiastic bunch who camped
outside college for two days to get
a prime spot in the crowd. Major
props also go to Wilkinson hall
though, who made off with the
20ft Bond poster at the end of the
red carpet and hung it from their
balcony for all to see; if they hadn’t
had to take it down because of fire
regs, they might’ve accidentally
hosted the premiere’s after party.
Imperial College TV, our very
own camera-wielding, YouTube
stardom seeking munchkins, failed
to sneak into the event, but did
manage to bag an interview with
new Top Gear presenter Chris
Evans. Low and behold, Evans took

a shine to the boys, taking hold
of the interview, and indeed their
actual camera.Obviously well worth
a watch, that.
Vaguely exciting though the
premiere was, it’s been a political
week, so we have gone a bit serious.
Ever since FELIX was founded,
debate has been heard radiating
from our offices, but I’m going
to confidently assume that no
editor has ever polled the room on
whether we should put a tampon on
the cover. Unable to help ourselves,
we went for it.
So, the House of Commons voted
to keep taxing sanitary products
as though they were luxury items.
Great. I don’t know if you’ve ever
seen a tampon, dear reader, but I’ll
tell you, there ain’t nothing luxe
about it. Yeah it’s only a 5% tax, but
it’s the principal.
There are lots of things we don’t
need but that we choose to buy
to make our lives a little bit nicer.
Occasionally, I have a Whole Foods
quesadilla. People heat their houses
with radiators. You don’t choose
menstruation,menstruation chooses
you, making taxing tampons as
though they were non-essential
bloody madness.
In a bizarre turn of events, the
(unelected) House of Lords (sortof)
saved the day (for a bit) by delaying
the proposed tax credit cuts. Even
flying in obscure, but yes, real peers
like Andrew Lloyd Webber couldn’t
swing the vote. Personally though,
if I was voting to cut the incomes
of our poorest families by a grand a
year, I’d not have flown in from the
US in first class. But that’s just me.
Lots has got us riled this week,
so if you have any feelings about
anything you read, pop us an email.
Ooh go on, vent. We’re listening.
We’ll probably even publish those
feelings. It’s like a blog, except
someone besides your mum might
read it.
