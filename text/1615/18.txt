I
t’s been a couple of weeks into
term, and each week we’ve
been here telling you about the
best shows in town, pondering
the great importance of art and
pointing out its virtues.
But maybe you’ve always secretly
wanted to point out that this whole
section is dedicated to fluff that
shouldn’t be given such a big place
in a publication, much less the
publication of a university dedicated
to the concrete betterment of
mankind using science and
technology. And with the direction
contemporary art seems to be going,
we don’t blame you. Indeed, even as
a GCSE art student listening to my
teacher trying to convince me that
Tracey Emin’s unmade bed was a
supreme work of art worth writing
about, I wondered if there was any
value in much of the enormous
volume of “art” that is produced
today,each trying to outdo the other
in originality.
Until recently, the arts have
typically been regarded as a luxury,
a kind of yardstick of one’s wealth.
Only the rich and well-dressed can
afford tickets to the opera; only the
wealthy are able to acquire paintings
for their personal galleries. To
most people, art was thought to
have no immediate practical value
(except perhaps in the time before
photography). What then, of the
increasingly abstract art that fills the
galleries today? Even as our galleries
and stages present increasingly
controversial and unorthodox works,
the drive to produce original pieces
that are as different as possible
from what is already on display
remains relentless. What was once
regarded as “fine art” by virtue of
the fact that the influential enjoyed
them has been slowly taken over by
contemporary artworks that force us
to constantly redefine “art”.
Yet, most of us seem to intuitively
recognise the inherent value of
works of art. In this country at
least, where one can view famous
paintings regardless of wealth and
prom for five quid classical concerts,
there is an importance placed on the
appreciation of arts and culture that
makes society uniquely vibrant and
full of character.
Art is a waste of time!
It’s a bold claim, but is it actually true?
Jingjie Cheng

Indeed, it is this inextricable link
between a society and its art that is
arguably the most practical reason
one can think of to support the
arts. It has always been an enduring
means of expression for people of
all nationalities and eras, forming
an integral part of the richness of
many national and ethnic cultures.
It builds identity and serves as a
record of time, people and places.
Take something as monumental
as the Berlin Wall for example. Its
graffiti served as an avenue for West
Germans to vent their frustrations
and freely express their opinions
while those on the East were not
permitted to go anywhere near –
vivid as a representation of the Cold
War.
When we appreciate Ancient
Greek pottery or the frescos in
the Sistine Chapel, their cultures
live on in our appreciation of their
art. The consciousness of a people
are crystallised in their artistic
achievements and are passed on
across generations, kept alive by
the interest surrounding them.
Modern societies too recognise
the importance of art in shaping
identities – just look at the 2008
Beijing Olympics. Clearly China
saw it as a grand opportunity to
impress a global audience and
bolster its image as a fast-rising
nation.
Many of the pieces we have
reviewed in the past few weeks
involve art as social commentary –
whether in Ai Weiwei’s installations

art in many countries. Art is a
valuable avenue for public debate of
important social issues and brings
new and revolutionary perspectives
to the table, provoking diverse
interpretations and reactions and
constructive criticisms. Reading
John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of
Wrath makes the conditions of
the Great Depression far more
vivid than any news report can
give. Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for
Godot introduced Existentialism
to the public in a way that Sartre
could never have achieved with his
book. Almost every newspaper has
a cartoon with something witty
to say about the week’s issues. By
decorating the message, it can
sometimes be made more palatable,
more subtle, more poignant.
Art clearly has a role to play in
society. That is all well and good,
but what has all of the above got to
do with the individual? Of course,
there are musicals and plays and
gigs that all of us enjoy, but there is
also a deep satisfaction in pondering
art that is traditionally seen as more
“inaccessible”, such as visual art.
Besides making you a more refined
and cultured individual (and giving
you more conversation fodder
at parties), thinking about art
provides insight into worlds that we
would never be able to experience
ourselves. Because art is necessarily
a personal work conjured from
personal experiences and emotions,
it is also a window to the way others
see the world, and that in itself adds
richness to our own experience.
T
here is an amazing depth
to what goes through
your head when you’re
lonely. The soundtrack to
your life, swarms of loving friends
around you, the fragments of self-
belief. It is so easy to believe that if
only you had the courage to speak up
and confront the people in your life,
they’d all understand your worries
and see it your way. But the reality is
much harsher, and the sweetness of
this dream state quickly turns bitter.
On the great American road trip,
following the godlike icons ofTeddy
Roosevelt and Elvis, RoosevElvis
portrays an emotionally honest and
personal view of loneliness and self-
doubt in the American dream. The
latest creation by the Brooklyn based
TEAM, Ann is drowning in her
insecurity. With the hallucinatory
visions of Elvis and Teddy fighting
for her soul, Ann meets Brenda.
A free spirit whose easy approach
to life challenges the monotony
of Ann’s world, Brenda is a true
character highlighting the truth of

Brooklyn based ensemble bring their most intimate and touching work to London
Ann’s deeply depressing loneliness.
A bittersweet and touching story,
RoosevElvis is performed by the
stellar double act of Libby King as
Ann and Elvis, and Kristen Sieh
as Brenda and the outrageous
Roosevelt. The message is sad, but
there is an innate humour to the
TEAM’s work. The TEAM has
embraced multimedia,and although
I’m not really a fan, it does give the Kristen Sieh (left) with the impressive Libby King Photo Credit: the TEAM
London audience a deeply personal
insight into this classic American
road story. Nothing is done in
half-measures, but they don’t take
themselves too seriously.
For a large part of the show, I felt
Sieh’s performance outshone the
less impressive King, but by the
end and especially in hindsight,
their performances so beautifully
reflected the personality conflict of
their characters that I can’t really
fault them. A contrast between the
outgoing arrogance of Teddy and a
restrained fear and self-doubt from
Ann, RoosevElvis is emotionally
challenging, playful and at times
a wonderfully idyllic view of the
American dream in an oddly ironic
sense.Reminding me of the fantastic
Little Miss Sunshine, RoosevElvis
isn’t the most exciting of stories but
nice. It feels right and it feels real
and I commend it for that.

Cutting Comedy’s Edge
Comedians face off against each other in a battle of funny at the Comedy Store
E
very Tuesday evening
the Comedy Store plays
host to a topical comedy
show, drawing together a
set of premium, not-so-well-known
The show started by introducing
each of the comedians, first up
was Ian Stone, acting initially as
compère, he had a quirky and self
deprecating style. Ben Norris was
next up, delivering sharp but relaxed
jokes which tingled the audience
to laughter. Then a bulldozer of a
comedian Jarred Christmas stormed
on stage with an angry yet hilarious
persona, letting loose the f bomb at
every available opportunity. From
over the pond Scott Capurro was
next on sharing with the audience
detailed stories of his eccentric gay
lifestyle. Roger Monkhouse then
took to the stage engaging the
audience with top quality banter.
Last on was Rob Deering, bringing
out his guitar and boyish charisma
that charmed the room to giggles.

comedians. Just nestled down the
road from Piccadilly Circus on
Oxendon Street, this comedy club
hauls in crowds after a day’s work
(or shopping) to fall victim to their
audience preying comedians.
Rolling up with Imperial Comedy,
I certainly felt safe in numbers and
it was not long before the first
comedian picked out a particularly
drunk member of the audience
to be the butt of numerous jokes.
You could literally hear every other
person on the front row breath out
a sigh of relief, it was not going to
be them.

Great for
a casual
Tuesday
The show then quickly proceeded
to a series of topical games where
members of the audience were given
the opportunity to provide topics
from the past year and then from
the past week, for the comedians
to perform with. Some of the
comedians managed brilliantly
with this improvisation, like Jarred
Christmas, who entertained the
audience enough to be voted as
the winner. Others obviously were
just trying and struggling to relate
given topics to previous stand up
routines that they had performed.
Some others, such as Scott Capurro,
were dealt a tough hand and to the
delight of the audience flumped on
stage, consequently being voted off.
If you enjoy seeing comedians
being tortured on stage then this
show is definitely for you. However
much of a bad time it looks like
they’re having, don’t worry, it’s all
part of the show. Such an engaging
and interactive show is great for a
casual Tuesday evening.
Every Tuesday at 8pm in Picadilly
