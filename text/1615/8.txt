T
he audience sat in room
G16 of the Sir Alexander
Fleming Building (SAF).
We sat in silence as
Professor David Nutt, psychiatrist
and neuropsychopharmacologist,
voiced his opinions on the drug
legislature that we live by today.
Prof Nutt,well known for his radical
views, such as an eyebrow raising
deposition that horse riding is more
dangerous than illicit drug use,
did not fail to provide a pragmatic
solution to this taboo topic.
The Misuse of Drugs Act,brought
into effect in 1971, listed the
psychoactive substances banned for
public use and allocated appropriate
punishment for the non-compliant.
This policy resulted from a treaty
devised at a United Nations
Convention on Psychotropic
Substances and thus, the worldwide
criminalisation of recreational drug
users and addicts commenced.
However, this law did not only
marginalise the society’s vulnerable,
it gave the Home Secretary power
over the drugs licensing system,
control over drug categorisation and
subsequent choice in punishment
for misconduct. This, reiterated by
Professor Nutt numerous times
last Tuesday, was the start of drug
laws as a political tool and allowed
decisions to be made by those
with no understanding of scientific
evidence.
One of the arguments frequently
voiced in the defence of drug laws,
is that illicit drug use leads the user
down a path of mental disorders and
crime.In fact,this ‘crime’committed
by the inebriated costs our police
force £7 billion a year. However, it
is not MDMA (which has virtually
no evidence of causing social harm)
or cocaine, which influences these
‘criminals’. It is, sadly, alcohol.
Professor Nutt’s Independent
Scientific Committee on Drugs
published a report demonstrating
alcohol as the overall most harmful
drug in existence. Heroin came in
second and crack cocaine third. He
elaborated by disclosing that 80%
of alcoholics have other mental
disorders and 40% of suicides are
committed thanks to drink every
year.
Evidence depicts drugs as a safer
option than alcohol, a legal and
unregulated substance, and since
three young people die of alcohol
poisoning a week, drug laws cannot
be based on science. Drug policy is
based on use. Professor Nutt’s blog
Drug Science calls for ‘evidence not
exaggeration’, and is careful to stress
that all drug use carries a risk.
However, deaths go up when
the market is forced underground.
In 1971 Britain had 1000 heroin
addicts. The aftermath of the
Misuse of Drugs Act now sees the
NHS battling over 200,000 cases
of addiction. It is now illegal to
prescribe heroin; users are forced to
get their fix in other ways such as by
selling to others, which only serves

2015’ passed its second reading this
October and sets out to ban the
sale of any psychoactive substance,
regardless of harms and benefits.
Professor Nutt stressed that this law
willpreventanyfurtherinvestigation
into safer alternatives to alcohol
and will impede the development
of other psychoactive substances to
treat common mental disorders such
as schizophrenia. The definition of
‘psychoactive drugs’ is loose. Does
this also relate to antipsychotic
drugs or antidepressants? Professor
Nutt’s team is currently embarking
on the UK’s first clinical trial
using the psychedelic ingredient
in magic mushrooms, psilocybin,
to treat clinical depression. To
his exasperation, government
regulations controlling the licensing
of illegal drugs in research and EU
guidelines have stalled the start of
the trial. The Professor is urging
them to rethink regulations. Not all
psychoactive drugs are recreational
and certainly not all are harmful;
some, he argues, have clear benefits
and the potential to revolutionise
mental health research.
The final and perhaps most
interesting question put to
Professor Nutt last Tuesday evening
was, ‘if you were Home Secretary,
Governments too anal when it comes to setting drug legeslation laws. Photo

what would be your drugs policy?’
Unsurprisingly, his answer was
unambiguous and rational.
To paraphrase the Chair of the
Independent Scientific Committee
on Drugs and the Vice-President of
theEuropeanBrainCouncil:alcohol
should be made the threshold for
policy. Everything classed below as
less harmful, including MDMA,
cannabis and ecstasy, should be
regulated and licensed. It is only
then that you can address the issue
of alcohol abuse and bring the fifth
most dangerous drug in the world
under the same control.
Nevertheless, the Professor ended
his talk with a harrowing message –
drug misconduct is politically useful
and scientific evidence does not
seem to fit into political campaigns.
Despite the evidence that
criminalising those who take drugs
will destroy more lives than taking
them, politicians are determined
to make decisions that perceive
the elected as taking control of an
extremely volatile national concern.
He concluded that drug laws are
based on a hatred for those who like
to do things differently – and this
90-minute lecture certainly told us
that Professor David Nutt likes to
do things differently.
to escalate the problem. Rightly so,
the Professor calls for a rethink in
government attitude to this disease.
