China overhauls one child policy
C
hina has scrapped its
infamous one-child
policy after more than
three decades, it was
revealed this week.
The ruling Communist Party
issued a statement following a four-
day summit in Beijing, revealing
that couples will now be allowed to
have up to two children.
This change in policy is intended
to “balance population development
and address the challenge of an
ageing population,”according to the
statement, published on the state-
run Xinhua news agency.
Concerns over rising social costs
and falling worker numbers had lead
to relaxations in some provinces,
and formal relaxation in national
rules occurring two years ago, with
this major change to the policy
being rumoured for several months.
Some have praised the move as
a step forwards, allowing greater
individual freedoms for Chinese
citizens and reducing the right of
the state to interfere in the right to
a family life.
However, others have suggested
the move does not go far enough, as
the Communist party still maintains
full control over the size of Chinese
families, albeit with one additional
child per couple.
Amnesty International issued a
statement warning that “couples
that have two children could still be
subjected to coercive and intrusive
forms of contraceptions, and even
forced abortions - which amounts
to torture.”
William Nee, China researcher at
Amnesty International, added “the
state has no business regulating how
many children people have.”

UCAS to anonymise university applications
T
his week the government
announced plans to
remove candidate
names from university
applications in a move to prevent
unconscious bias against ethnic
minority candidates.
UCAS, the body which
handles admissions for nearly all
undergraduate courses in the UK,
will now consult with institutions
on how best to name-blind
applications.
Mary Curnock Cook, the chief
executive of UCAS,also promised to
look into “a wider range of changes
which could impact applications
from black and ethnic minority
students”.
The admissions body regularly
carriesoutresearchondatafrompast
admissions cycles to help identify
issues of under-representation. Ms
Curnock Cook stressed that “UCAS
is deeply committed to increasing
participation from disadvantaged
groups”.
Announcing the move in an
article for The Guardian, David
Cameron expressed his hope “to
end discrimination and finish the
fight for real equality in our country
today”.
The Prime Minister highlighted
research showing that 55% of offers
from leading universities are made
to white candidates, while just 23%
go to their black counterparts.
Noting that the reasons behind
statistics such as these are
complex, Mr Cameron stated that
“unconscious bias is clearly a risk”.
Details of candidates’ educational
backgrounds will still be included
in UCAS forms, as this information
is considered essential to assessing
applications. Universities will be
informed of candidate names
should they choose to invite them
to interview.
Meanwhile, leading graduate
employers in the public and private
sectors have also committed to
anonymising candidates during the
recruitment process.
Employers including the Civil
Service, the NHS, Teach First,
the BBC, HSBC, KPMG, Virgin
Money and Deloitte will now
name-blind application forms.
John Manzoni, the Civil Service
Chief Executive, expressed his
confidence “that this important step
will help us build an organisation
that is even more talented, diverse
and effective than it is today”.

over the intent of the policy change,
with Stuart Gietel-Basten, associate
professor of social policy at the
University of Oxford, writing in
The Conversation that this reform
is actually “a pragmatic response to
an unpopular policy that made no
sense.”
Introduced in 1979, the
controversial policy was intended
to slow the population growth rate
and is estimated to have prevented
recruiters to announce other
changes to its selection process
recently, removing information on
candidates’ educational background
from applications in an attempt to
diversify the talent pool.
Chief Executive David Sproul
said that the additional measure of
name-blinding applications would
help “ensure that job offers are
made on the basis of potential, not
ethnicity, gender or past personal
circumstance”.
Representatives from leading
graduate employers will now take
part in discussions at Downing
Street to set out plans for the
changes. UCAS is expected to start
removing candidate names from
applications by 2017.
around 400 million births.
Couples violating the policy
would face punishments ranging
from fines to forced abortions. It
appears that these punishments will
remain in place for couples with
more than two children.
The proposal still needs to be
approved by China’s top legislature
before it can be enacted, according
to Xinhua, although approval is
unlikely to be withheld.
