I went to the Bond premiere
B
y some spectacular stroke
of luck I managed to get
my paws on a ticket to the
Spectre premiere. I’m not
just talking a ticket to see the film,
I mean full on red carpet walking
boozing and schmoozing tickets.
You’d have to be living under a
rock to have missed the build up to
the premiere. Two days of rigging,
road closures all along Prince
Consort Road and a handful of die
hard Bond fans camping out to be
in the crowd. As a jammy cow with
an office right above the action and
a ticket to the main event I was
asked to tell you all the mad things
that happened.
Let’s start with the cars and a
shout out a particular crane operator.
This guy craned a Jaguar CX57
and 007’s DB10 through the gap
between the Albert Hall and those
posh flats to place them in front of
a massive expensive looking screen.
The guy deserves a medal,a clean set
of underwear and a stiff drink.
Security was pretty tight on the
night. En route back to office on
Monday afternoon I had to fight
through a massive queue of fans
waiting to get their bags thoroughly
searched before having to show my
ID card to what felt like a gazillion
security guards. Unlike with Union
bar staff, I couldn’t use ‘my face is on
the screens’ to get through.
Union staff found themselves
having to clear meeting rooms in
Beit of randoms all afternoon. This
includes one lady who apparently
would not quit and kept returning
to her vantage point. Ironically,
while I was on the red carpet half
the Union was hanging out of the
same windows.
Finally we get to the main
event. Red carpet time. Dressed
to the nines, I headed off with my
embossed ticket to strut my ginger
stuff. For those who care, I wore a
teal silk dress made from a 1960’s
Vogue pattern from my nan’s back
cupboards and vintage jewellery.
Obviously I was upstaged by Bond
Girl Lea Seydoux.
I spent my time on the red carpet
taking selfies, making the people
who queued for hours in the cold
sick with envy and hoping to run
into the glorious Daniel Craig.I love
an older man. The highlight of my
red carpet experience came when I
Jennie Watson

was interviewed by ICTV. Those
in the crowd were likely wondering
what I ever did to be interviewed
on a red carpet. Big Brother season
2? Guest appearance on TOWIE?
ICU Meet the Candidates? I’m
pretty certain the security guy was
taking the piss with “I hope you
enjoyed your interview Madame”.
Who cares, I met Will.i.am at the
bar 10 minutes later.
I probably have to mention the
royals. Wills and Kate turned up,
with Harry third wheeling. They
didn’t have to walk the red carpet
like the rest of us peasants, they
drove up. The entire audience then
watched them walking into the
Albert Hall on the screen.
The film is brilliant by the way.
As you can imagine Bond gets laid,
some cars get trashed and things
blow up. You should go and see it.
Monday nights will be crap for
the rest of my life.
Meet the 007 megafans
Y
ou might’ve thought
skiving lectures on
Monday to catch a
glimpse of national
treasure Daniel Craig and a handful
of royals as they attended the Spectre
premiere was pretty cheeky. That’s
nothing compared to these fans,
who camped out on Prince Consort
Road for three days to secure a place
right at the front of the crowds
lining the red carpet.
On Saturday, 41 people signed up
for front row spots to see the film’s
cast, as well as Prince Harry, Prince
William and his wife, Kate, who
attended the glamorous event.
People with camping chairs and
sleeping bags began to appear on
Saturday, when they set up outside
the Holy Trinity Church on a
closed Prince Consort Road. The
first arrival was an Ipswich couple in
their 60s who grabbed the last train
to London on Friday and arrived
at 1am on Saturday morning. They
also claimed to be the first in line 3
years ago when Skyfall premiered at
the same venue.
The huge Bond fans said they
had watched all 23 Bond movies in
the build-up for tonight, until they
“went blind”.
When asked why they had
returned for Spectre, the couple said
they had come very close to a selfie
with Daniel Craig last time and
that they would attempt it again on
this occasion. Another person joked
that he knows the films so well
he’s starting to think he is Bond,
although this FELIX reporter
would comment that his physique
was not a conventional one for the
part.
The campers repeatedly called
High Street Kensington’s 24-hour
McDonald’s a “life saver”. The
harsh sleeping conditions of an
uncovered London road in the cold
were ridiculed by one camper, who
claimed he was “hardcore” enough
to survive Saturday’s rain and 2°C
night temperature, although he did
complainthathissleepwasdisturbed
by rowdy Imperial students leaving
the Oktoberfest celebrations at the
union on Saturday night.
The uber fans boasted of having
seen Bond’s Aston Martin DB10,
star of the trailer’s car chase in
Rome, get delivered to the Royal
Albert Hall beforehand.
The keenest campers, who were at
the front of the red carpet,expressed
fears of being shaken and stirred
by the crowds expected, but when
asked why they have gone to so
much trouble for a glimpse of an
actor, one said, “Well it’s Bond. It
doesn’t get bigger than that,does it?”

ICTV meetTop Gear host
I
CTV’s Jonathon Masters and
Hasan Al-Habib managed to
wangle a YouTube gem at the
Spectre premiere: an interview
with Chris Evans.
After being flagged down by
Imperial College TV at the end of
the red carpet, Evans paused to talk
to the roving reporters.
He was handed a microphone by
the rookies, which wasn’t plugged
into anything, muttering “this is
hilarious” before telling the boys he
was excited to be joining Top Gear,
but was more excited about their
microphone.
Evans asked the boys if they’d
applied to be a host of the new
show, with Al-Habib responding
that he was “tempted by Amazon
Prime”, the company set to run a
show with the original Clarkson/
May/Hammond cast.
Chris then, cursing his own
interviewing technique, gestured
for the camera. Masters obliged
without hesitation, and Chris began
to film the two.
Taking off his own glasses, he
shoved them to Masters, a similarly
firey redhead.
Filming himself and the ICTV
duo, he exclaimed, “this is the real
Chris Evans interview!”
Referring to strawberry blonde
Masters, he pleased the crowd,
quipping,“that’s what I used to look
like!”
“I’m so jealous of his hair, it’s
proper ginger hair, mine’s rubbish.”
Evans was without his glasses after ICTV got hold of him. Photo Credit: ICTV
