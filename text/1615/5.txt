Why are Imperial students so apathetic
about politics?
It is time that we acknowledged our failure to act,
find a cause, and make a difference

T
he students of Imperial
are, in my experience,
greatly lacking in their
enthusiasm for political
and social issues when compared
to their contemporaries at other
institutions. While it might be true
that there is growing resentment
and disillusionment among students
towards the political class, this does
not excuse the alarming lack of
visible activism and demonstration
across campus.
This might seem strange for
a university that prides itself in
having the largest election turnout
in England & Wales, but it is the
logical conclusion for a student
population that is more interested in
becoming part of the establishment
than making the world a better
place.
Sustaining pressure on the
government and other bodies
(including college) is incredibly
important. Our involvement and
engagement in politics must extend
beyond voting in general and local
elections. We vote politicians into
power, and rely on leaders who
continually break their promises. In
the past, we have seen that students
are often the most vulnerable to
such shameless reversals of policy,
and yet now we are almost silent.
Have we been so demoralised by
the failure of students in the past to
overcome an increase in tuition fees
that we have given up? Thousands
are still fighting back at universities
across the country, so why aren’t
we among them? Imperial and its
students live in a bubble.
It would be unfair not to highlight
the good work that many students
contribute to through the student
union and its many societies.
Huge amounts of volunteering and
fundraising take place throughout
the year, and last year alone students
managed raise over £100,000 for
charity. To be fully effective, this
needstobedonealongsideconcerted
efforts to lobby government or other
appropriate institutions. Changing
policy is the ultimate solution;
anything else merely solves the
problem in the short term.
While the Union must remain
non-partisan, it will campaign on
issues that are brought forward to
Union Council. A list of the policies
that have passed Council is available
online and some of these are very
progressive, but in the past, very few
have been publicised to the extent
necessary to encourage student
participation in these specific causes.
There is obviously some appetite
for mass protest at Imperial and we
have seen this in the recent action
against the proposed changes to
junior doctor contracts.This passion
needs to continue and spread to
other causes, ones which not only
affect us as students, but also those
which affect the weakest in society.
There are members of our elected
union who do care enough to get
involved in political action. The
Deputy President of Welfare and
this year’s Campaigns Officer
are both attending the upcoming
National Campaign Against Fees
and Cuts demonstration on the 4th
of November. Similarly, our Union
President is an avid elephant activist
and I hope she can extend this
enthusiasm to the thousands of
students she represents. If the leader
of the Labour party can take time
out to show solidarity with student
activists surely our president can
too.
The Union’s communication is
ultimately its downfall;with so many
passionate students representing us,
it’s a shame that their voices are
never loud enough. While the NUS
may be a controversial institution,
their promotion and defence of the
rights of students is often heard on
a national level.
Why is it that our students are
less interested in bottom-up politics
than those at other universities? It
is possible that the multiple failed
campaigns of the Union in the
past, including their failure to stop
the closure of Weeks and Garden
Halls, have fostered a sense of
powerlessness among students. Of
course, in most of these cases it’s
the College which is completely at
fault, but, our union could do more
to become a dissenting voice.
General apathy could also be
as a result of the large percentage
of foreign students studying at
Imperial. I would be afraid of
protesting in a country that wasn’t
my own, but when the government
is attempting to place counter-
There’s no
better time
than at

make your
voice heard
intuitive restrictions on foreign
students, they must stand with us.
However,there are other universities
where a similarly large proportion
of the student population is from
abroad and some of these are well
known for their activism.
As a university specialising in
science and technology, students are
more familiar working with fact and
analysis than they are with opinions.
It seems as if most students are just
coming to Imperial in the hope that
they will one day work for the banks
and large corporations that are the
cause all of our problems. They
would rather join the powerful than
work on the side of the exploited.
When a very large amount of
opportunities that are available to
students are at companies with no
discernible benefit to society, it is
easy to understand why so few of
us at Imperial are willing to stand
up to injustice. The College and
careers services should do more
to attract companies that have a
positive impact on the world, and
they should encourage students to
create startups that actually solve
real problems, rather than build
companies around interesting
technological advancements. Only
when students start to see others
around them contributing are they
likely to want to help.
For me, this is the very first step
in acknowledging my own failure
to act. It’s time for you and I to get
involved. This is my impassioned
call to arms: protest, occupy and
overcome the insurmountable. Find
a cause and make a difference; there
is no better time than at university
to make your voice heard.
