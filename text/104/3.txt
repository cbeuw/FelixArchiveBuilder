Much i s wr; t ten i n FELIX about the clubE
and societies p.f th*? College, and we readily
welcome reports on activities. But other
activities exist at I.C. i.i*ides those spon-
sored by clubs: even L! una Hals no lnterSsts
catered for by a Colle,-e cluh - and surely
this must be rare - one i s s t i l l a member of
a large club - Imperial College Union. This
is primarily a social e.'.ub, and, besides
providing eating and drinking f a c i l i t i e s , i t
provides a means whereby students can get
to know each other and discuss matters other
than the subject which they are studying,
they can thus better their knowledge of the
world i n which we l i v e , and be bett?r equip-
ped to go into this outside world; i n other
words, they obtain a fuller education.
This i s not the only means of educating
oneself; experience, though a hard master,
is thoroughly efficient. But we should con-
sider ourselves fortunate that we, as stud-
ents, have the opportunity to ease our path.
It might be said that one can obtain the
benefits of social intercourse elsewhere
than at the Union. Perfectly true, but sure-
ly f a c i l i t i e s at I.C. are second to none,
and one's everyday laboratory or workshop
companions can provide a stepping-stone to
further exchange of ideas, so broadening
one's outlook.
At the prsent moment, the majority of
I.C. students are so widely scattered over
London, that many are discouraged from
us ng •he Unior, because they live or have
digs -o far away. The increased Hostel
accommodation w i l l ease this somewhat, but,
of course, the ideal, but unfortunately im-
practicable eolutior, would be a f u l l y
residential College. Until this Eldorado
is reached, a f u l l University education at
I.C. w i l l always be beset wl th d i f f i c u l t i e s
to be overcoir.t.

NEW UNION DEBATED
"This House i s disappointed in the design of
the new Union Building" was the motion put before
the House by the chairman, Mr.T.Smith, on Tuea.
day, 5th, March.
Mr.Joe Cooke opened the motion by considering
that we should be worthy of a building comparable
to our status, as the loading technological col-
lage i n the country. Instead of a modem b u i l -
ding we were saddled with on* where Insufficient
thought had been exercised i n the design. The
lounge reminded him of the waiting room at
Paddington as i t appeared to be the only route
between the refectory and bar, and the Concert
Hall, which was l i t t l e better than many village
halls, was both too long and too narrow with the
result that tha stage was too far away for those
seated at tha back of the auditorium.
In opposing the motion Mr. Jim Anderson ex-
plained that tha original p l u s war* drawn up i n ,
1927 for only 1000 students, but wars shelved
until 1953 when various student committees were
asked to suggest amendments. Ha asked the House
to consider that i n the general expansion of I.C.
with refectories and lounges not only centred
about tha Union but In Princer Cardans and on the
MUSIC AT I.e.
Dear S i r ,
I do not know whether Mr. Dixon i s
accurate i n saying that music lovers at I.C.
w i l l be found at U.L.U. by the score, but I
am quite sure that the f a c i l i t i e s for music
lovers at this collage axe outstandingly good.
They include lunch-hour recitals, General
Study lectures, and a record lending-library.
The Imperial College Choir i s at present
about seventy five strong and need not fear
comparison with the L.u.M.s. Sopranos and
contraltos coming to the Choir from other
Colleges have told me that they have joined th
the I.C. Choir i n preference to the L.U.M.S.
A madrigal group has been started this term
for those who wish to learn more of the "Golden
Age of British Music".
Instrumentalists are catered for by the
Orchestra, which i s taking part i n "Trial by
Jury" this term, and by chamber music groups.
Coaching i n chamber music i s available and
those players of sufficiently high standard are
encouraged to play at the lunch hour concerts.
Several members of the I.C.Musical Society have
taken part i n chamber music concerts at U.L.U.
With a l l this activity hare at I.e., I
do not believe i t i s necessary for any I.C.
man to go to Bloomsbury i n search of music.
Yours etc.
G.G.Pope.
(Chairman, I.C.Choir)
Imperial institute site, the building should ba
regarded as a clubhouse.
Mr. Fineh, seconding the notion, complained
he s t i l l waited 20 minutes for lunch wherever he
went. The Union was a "bodged-up job" with two
storeys stuck on top of the old building.
Seconding the opposition, Mr. Dick Saunders
pointed out that most rooms were multipurpose
and hence could not be expected to be as com-
fortable as I f only designed for ona purpose.
Prom tha floor Mr. Allen suggested that a l -
though the building did net f i t l a with the
Roderic K i l l building I t s t i l l had s good basis
design. Mr. Jarmin complained that there wars no
paraboloid staircases, while Mr. Larkls suggested
we exchanged our building with ULD. Mr. Samacta
was surprised that the proposition wanted aora
corridors since these were both draughty and
unsightly. Mr. Al-Kaaln who has • phobia against
sitting In long narrow rooms such ss the lounge,
regretted that the building was sot built In the
same functional style as the Roderic H i l l building
On a division the motion was carried by 40
votes to 16.
P R A I S E — AT LAST I
Dear S i r ,
Your correspondent g.R.I.(Elderly Reg-
istered Nurse?) sets out several points of
objection to our cat; I cannot leave them unans-
wered.
He f i r s t refers to the dog-eared and dilapid-
ated condition of his copy. I suspect that i t
waa second hand - i f he bothers to buy bis own
this week he should find i t i n the same pristine
and unsullied condition as that of most members
of the Sales Staff.
To his second point,I would reply that i f tha
gentleman cannot afford a dictionary he w i l l find
one i n most public libraries. Most people at I.C.
have passed School Certificate English, and this
standard ahould be sufficient to enable one to
realise that seventy words Is not a long sen-
tence outside "Comic Cuts" and "Dally Mirror".
The medication of "Felix" would be superfluous.
The modern trend In toilet paper l a towards soft-
ness and to use "Felix" as such would cause dis-
comfort and possibly damage to the user (cf.
Gargantua).
Finally, may I offer you my congratulations
on keeping up such a high standard i n your paper;
In humour, serious comment, and accurate reporting
I don't think any collage newspaper can beat I t .
Yours etc.,
P .McLean.
THAT BAR ACAH1
Sear S i r ,
Thar* have recently been many specul-
ations as to whether tha bar will be ktpt open.
t i l l 11p.m. as i t i s licensed to do so. I think
It would be helpful i f some o f f i c i a l comment
could ba made on this subject, especially In
v i s * of tha fact that a l l the 'locals' are now
open t i l l that tins.
Yours etc.,i
D.Butters.
Mr. Kitchener states that the Bar i s
kept open t i l l 11 p.m. i f and whan the
occasion demands e.g. on the nights of
a dinner. Otherwise, i t i a more trouble
than i t i s worth to keep open, partic-
u l a r l y as most people ocme i n only f o r
about 20 minutes before d o s i n g time,
regardless of when t h i s i s .
