On the 5th. March an Israeli Evening was org-
anised Jointly by the International Relations
Club and the Jewish Society, and a f u l l and
interesting programs was provided for the 250
people who attended.
The Evening commenced with a short film, f o l -
lowed by a talk on Iarael by Mr.Gershon Avner,
Counsellor at the Israeli Embassy. Afterwards
there was a recital of folk songs, followed by
the actor Tossi Graber, who captivated the aud-
ience with his very amusing act.
During the interval some of the produce and
crafts of Israel were exhibited and for refreah-
ment free oranges, wine and peanuts were provided]
for everybody.
The evening concluded with a demonstration of
folk dancing i n which the audience was invited to
join and the gusto with which they did so t e s t -
i f i e d to the quality of the wine provided earlier
Both societies can be congratulated on organising
such an enjoyable and successful Evening.
