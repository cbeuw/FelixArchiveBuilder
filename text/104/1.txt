THAT
U N I O N M E E T I N G
An I.o. Union General Meeting took place i n
the Concert n a i l last — '
A letter had bean received from Hiss Wendy
Pipe, commenting on the fact that while I.C.V.A.
always dressed "properly" whilst around the
Union, other Females (assumed to be associated
with I.C. men were"improperly" dressed (i.e. i n
slacks etc.). A notion was proposed from the .
floor to!
the effect that I.C.W.A. should be a l l -
owed to wear slacks i f they so wishedj this was
carried by an overwhelming majority.
Announcements were made about the Jubilee
Celebrations, of which details appeared i n the.
last "Jwlijrt The Union body commented adversely
on the fact that out of 230 places i n the Concert
Hall on May 2Bth, enly 58 of these were to be flsr
students. They were appeased to some extent, how-
ever, whan they were told from the Chair that,
although there were bound to be petty grievances,
tiia arrangements vara designed to give everyone
a f a i r chance. There i a to be closed-circuit \
t e l e v i s i o n — a few days ago the Beetor took part
i n an experimental run.
The Union strongly deprecated the action of
the I.e. students who removed the front wheel
froa BoI They should be told.it was said, that
Bo! was inviolate. K i t c h s a i d he would bring i t
up at the next Presidents' Council.
The much publicised question of the bar beer
was at long last settled. The motion that "the
bitter be changed to "Flowers'1
' was carried by a
comfortable majority, but the vote was preceded
by surprisingly l i t t l e discussion for such an
important matter.
Feelings ran high, however , on the question
of a small lounge. I t was announced that the
Senior Common Room Committee bad decided not to
move to the third' floor, so that their present
abode would not be available f o r student use, i n
particular to users of the Dining Hall (cries of
"shame"). I t was pointed out Ijhat this room was
in a key position of the Union, and that many
students have to walk through i t daily. I t was
asked how many lounges the staff had. The Pres-
ident replied that ha believed that they had one
i n Ayrton B a l l , and one In 179, Queens Sate,
besides the one- under discussion. From the floor
i t was remarked that the proportion of staff to
student lounge accommodation raa greatly i n
excess of the proportion of staff to students.
Miss Cowgill proposed that a petition should be
organised. Amid great acclaim, tarn President
suggested that Miss Cowgill should organise one.
After the meeting a large body of students walked
i n protest through the lounge; they found mo mem-
bers of the staff i n occupation.

Guilds:- Considerable feeling was arfcouaed by
the efforts of the administration to take over
the settjjamant of the damage at Kings Technical
School after the Lord Mayor's show. John Hart
expressed the hope that members of the union would
look at the lotice Boards every month or so.

which VIem-President Palmer lost his pants and-'

Constitution mas bean changed by abolishing
various committees and creating others, to
bring i t more i n line with modern scientific
thought. ~
