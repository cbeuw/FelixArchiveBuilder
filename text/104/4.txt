•Eobb', or to giro her her f o i l t i t l e , Mrs.
Robinson, i s the one-woman information bureau i n
the Union Office. I t i s seven years now since
she came to I.C. Previous to this aha worked f o r
the U.L. Appointments Board, finding jobs for
students (who now find jobs for her). The secret-
ary of I.C.Union rang the U.L.A.B. one day to
ask what kind of person they would recommend aa
a sort of secretary to the student officers.
Itebb described the qualifications and character
required for such a position, realised she pos-
sessed then a l l , and applied for the job. Fort-
unately for us, she got i t .
Her duties are varied, ranging from taking
minutes at Union Meetings or pacifying the Pres-
ident when his plans are being thwarted, to arr-
anging Freshers' hops with Bedford or selling
the lost property which has accumulated i n the
Unite Office. She i s quite definite, however,
in her assuranee that she enjoys the work.
When asked the funniest thing that ever hap-
pened to her i n the Union Office she replied
"Oh, Kitch, definitely."
Robb claims to be Patron Saint of a Polish
Club, and mother to a l l overseas students.
She likes students (clean), food, drink, and
smiling at people who go by the Union Office
window. She dislikes 'accommodation' spelt 'acc-
omodation' , and the phrase 'I don't lake g i r l s ,
Robb. I ' l l take you.'
We hope she w i l l stay at I.C. for many more
years. The Union and "its - Officers would certainly
be lost without her.
By a subtle stratagem, Bobb managed to evade
the flash-gun of our photographer. Our tame
functional artist has submitted the above as an
abstract representation of her.

CLUB REPORTS
'Brevity i s the soul of wit'
Rather than hold over any longer some of
the many Social Club reports that we Stave
received, we are publishing condensed versions
of them. Our apologies are given to the sec-
retaries concerned, both f o r the delay and
the abbreviation.
The CHRISTMAS ISLANDERS have expressed con-
cern at the Government's proposal to prostitute
the Islanders" hshitat with radiated s c i e n t i f -
ic f o l l y i n the near future. Three Island-
ers exposed their poetical compositions t o
the c r i t i c i s m of their fellow members. A
copy of the objects of this l i t e r a r y and
philosopioal venture can be obtained from
P. Jarman. (R.C.S.)
An A.G.M. of the U.L.U. LIBERAL FEDERATION
was held i n the Snack Bar at the begining of
the term. Resolutions pertaining to the
W.U.S. F e s t i v a l i n Moscow and to the problems
of Central Europe wene discussed. Plans th>
form an I.C. Liberal Club are given i n a
Letter t o the Editor t h i s week.
The inaugural meeting of the Huxley Soc-
i e t y was held recently. Prof. Tustin being i n
the chair. Mr. Ford M.A,,J.P. addressed the
Society, emphasising the ic&ose relationship
between the s c i e n t i f i c and humanist outlook.
He also spoke of the fundamental difference
between humanists and Christians and of the
attitude of the former to the question of
immortality.
34 members of I.C.C.U. enjoyed a weekend
of rest and fellowship when they discussed
The Way of Faith' i n a 16th. century
country house i n Essex.
Readers who l i v e i n o l d oastlea and
similar residences w i l l be interested to
hear that S.C.C. have provisionally ap-
proved a constitution f o r a PSYCHICAL
SOCIETY,*
RIDING CLUB.
There was suoh a response f o r the day
Ride on Sunday Feb 24th. that there were at
one time not enough horses for people. Ev-
entually five riders from I.C. and two from
L.S.E. arrived at Radnage near High Wycombe
in pouring r a i n which persisted most of the
day. A stop f o r lunoh was made at a pub
at Crowell! The r a i n d i d not damp the riders
enthusiasm, and there vfas only one objector
(from L.S.E.) when i t was decided to increase
the length of the ride.
TFhilst writing about the Hiding Club,
i t i s worth noting that f o r the f i r s t time
i n " i t ' s history the club has no lady mem-
bers. We seem to be suffering from the lack
of support noticed by IOTA, and reported i n
F e l i x recently. However the olub now has
i t s largest membership f o r a number of years.
