the deed

In an unusually pictorial rotation, Jo Kentish pans the bad,
cherishes the good and gives the ugly a good nose job.
The shaky bargain of Dr Fastus' and Mephastophilis is
reblooded in the deed at the grace theatre. Tintin heard the
incarnation.
As yet another Stephen King novelette makes it into filmhood,
Tintin got put away with the shawshank redemption. In a
canine version of companionship Tony Grew went walkies in
far from home: the adventures of yellow dog. Woof,
woof.
The world keeps on turning but when the sun sets Fiona
heads under cover, club cover to be precise. This week she
looks out for alovelick and brown sugar. Not sour.
After the success of their album, tintin caught up with the
throwing muses live at the shepherds bush empire. Back on
the decks of home, A/ok checks out carter's worry bomb
whilst he/en-/ou/se takes on the flamingoes' plastic jewels.

Although it has a good beat,
it's certainly not one of their
best. But buy it for track two,
'Right Time', which is catchy
with a great rhythm.

Don't be put off by the cover (or

lively, has a catchy tune and a
good beat.

With a funky rhythm and a

wrong. A great song.

This brill single has four mixes
of this housey song, all quite

As the director of the deed makes
clear in the programme, there is
little fear for modern man in
Christopher Marlowe's original 'Dr
Faustus'. The Sixteenth Century's
terror of Hell and everlasting
damnation can't be sustained in
our secular age. Instead the source
of fear has shifted from the
destination of our souls to the
manner of our death. The demons
that haunt us now are flesh and
bone and wield knives. This is the
rationale which has been applied to
'Dr Faustus' in order to produce
'the Deed'. Yet the tale is not so
obvious as to be a straight transfer
of roles from spiritual to temporal
realms. It's far more interesting
than that.
The play opens with an actor
practising his lines in an empty
theatre; he is playing the part of Dr
Faustus. Such is his dedication to
the part, he stays too long and so
meets the caretaker who is
preparing to lock up the building
for the night. A common regard for
Marlowe's play results in a solo
performance which hangs over the
edge of normality and falls into the
occult. Or does it? The relationship
between the two men and the roles
that seem to envelope them is
never formalised, which gives the
play much of its ambience and chill.
In the original text, Dr Faustus,
overburdened with pride in his skill
as physician and theologian, turns
to the dark arts of sorcery. Through
these he summons up
Mephastophilis, servant of Lucifer.
Together they strike a bargain,
sealed with blood, that
Mephastophilis will be Faustus'
willing servant for all his earthly
life, and in return Faustus signs
away his soul.
Although 'the Deed' does not
follow this line exactly, the
fundamental force of the bargain
remains. Slipping in between reality
and the words of Marlowe's play,
'the Deed' weaves together a
confusing but ultimately scary
storyline in a dramatic fashion.
Whilst both the actors carry the
play with conviction, Jonathon
Palmer (Mephastophilis) is
excellent. He switches between
tragic and terrifying moods with
easy bursts of malice, stealing all
the best tunes. It's not surprising
that he won the Drama Studio
London's best actor award a couple
of years ago.
Part metaphysical discussion,
part post-modern discourse, 'the
Deed' is an intelligent and thought
provoking play. Tuesdays is pay
what you c Â© ... so be careful what'
you offer.
