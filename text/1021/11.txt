Feature
Tony Grew on the recoil from Natural Born Killers.
Here's a good post-Valentines
idea: why not take your
loved one to see Natural
Born Killers? It is, after
all, the story of two
people so in love they
want to do everything
together. Both abused
as children, Mickey and
Mallory Knox represent
all that is pleasing about
the human spirit, over-
coming early trauma to
form a loving and
respectful relationship.
The fact that they take
revenge on the world
that has not been good
to them through a
murderous spree that leaves
scores dead is a side issue, but
with the hype that surrounds Oliver StoVie's
latest effort you may be forgiven for not knowing
that Mickey and Mallory have their good sides
too.
When we started to put this article
together there was a suggestion that we should
try to sound out various people about the issues
of violence and representation that NBK has
once again raised. But everybody was strangely
reticent. I am sure you are all aware that four
months ago the normally spineless British Board
of Film Classification plucked up the courage to
announce that they would not be granting the
film a certificate in this country; too violent, they
squeaked. Unfortunately for them their almost
unprecedented actions did not have the film
world shaking in its boots: the London Film
Festival announced that they would still show
NBK, it sold out in less than half an hour, and
there were even rumours that the National Film
Theatre were planning to show it, with or
without the BBFC's permission. As well as this,
there were the usual accusations of censorship,
and a cynic might
suggest, intense pres-
sure from Warner Bros -
aware no doubt of the
amount of free publicity
their movie was getting
and anxious to cash in.
So the BBFC gave in. But
when F E L I X phoned
them last week they
refused to comment on the whole incident, or
indeed on their policies about violence, which
confusingly bleats Pulp Fiction good but Natural
Born Killers bad, with little justification. Gracious
in their trouncing of the censors, Warner Bros
also had little to say except that they are "very
happy" with the decision and hope to "make as
much money as this fine movie deserves".
Personally, I have never understood what
all the fuss was about. Having seen NBK both in
the US and on pirate video in London, it seemed
no more or less violent than a dozen other
movies I could mention. It is shocking and at
times uncomfortable, but in terms of the
message and the sheer artistic merit of the film
Oliver Stone makes
Tarantino look like a
kid with a cheap
video camera. For
Natural Born Killers
marks the apex of an
already remarkable
career. All of the
techniques, visionary
design and photo-
his government to
assassinate President
Kennedy, is often
painful to watch. But
it is real, and the
attacks on NBK show
a basic ignorance of
what Oliver Stone is
trying to achieve an
inability to come to
terms with his
message. It could be
argued that Natural
Born Killers is not a
movie about serial
killers but about the
media. For Stone is
not attempting to
satirise the murders
that Mickey and Mallory
commit, but rather the way
in which the American tabloid TV shows trivialise
the violence they are obsessed by. The movie is
not an exploration of the murderers, but rather
of their media image, and once again Stone
p e r f e c t l y
mimics mod-
ern America
and its con-
tradictions.

film makers reach their finest achievement here.
It is, without doubt, the masterpiece of one of
cinema's most under-rated talents. This is quite
some achievement for a man who has already
made movies such as JFK, The Doors, Platoon
and Born On The Fourth Of July, all of them
burned into the consciousness of their viewers.
What Stone does

best, and what he
undoubtedly does here,
is to take a step back
from the issues that are
fundamental to the
American way of life,
the fibre of their
society. In the past he
has dealt with Vietnam,
both in the field and returning home as a
veteran no-one wants to cheer: America's greed
and the primacy of the market: the death of a
President and the cover-up. But at their heart
Stone's movies are about people, real people
dissatisfied with the American system, used by it
or victims of it. The reality of the story he
presents, of Ron Kovic coming to terms with his
disabling war wounds, of Jim Morrison sliding
into an early grave, or of the patriotic Jim
Garrison slowly uncovering a conspiracy within
and their TV responds. One only has to look at
the OJ Simpson trial, televised daily and in full
on C N N , to know that Stone is not
exaggerating. In a period of three months in the
US last year there were 45 docu-dramas, as they
are called, about murders, all with very high
ratings. The whole tone of Oliver Stone's movie,
which we in Britain may find slightly
uncomfortable, is painfully representative of the
approach of American TV to the topic of serial
killing.
The criticism that NBK will cause violence,
that it is dangerous, is preposterous. As Stone
said:
"During a performance of Schindler's List
in a movie theatre in California a man got up
and shot the person in front of him through the
head, but I don't see anyone calling for it to be
banned. If someone is capable of that sort of
violence then anything could trigger him. The
movies don't make people into killers."
I recommend that you see Natural Born
Killers, if only to find out whether you end the
movie as I did, feeling sorry for the American
public. They have been told crime is evil, yet
they are taught to be obsessed with it, in love
with it. And they wonder, with mass-murderers
the best known people in the country, why they
have such a crime rate. Makes you think. Q
