Pratchett Illustrator Visits IC
Josh Kirby, science fiction and
fantasy illustrator, presented a
number of slides on his work at
the Haldane library on
Wednesday.
Josh Kirby is probably best
known for his illustrations of
Terry Pratchett's hugely
successful humourous novels.
The work presented consisted
mostly of his covers for the
fantasy author. He said that he
liked w o r k i n g with T e r r y
Pratchett and that they have
developed an 'exceptional'
relationship through their work.
He has also illustrated a number
of books that have imitated
Pratchett's style in the wake of
the Discworld novels, but
admitted that, although they
were 'good fun to illustrate',
some are 'appaling to read'.
Besides his more recent
work, he presented a selection of
his older works, including other
novel illustrations. Josh K i r b y
has been illustrating profess-
ionally for more than 20 years.
H e chronicled the s t r i k i n g
development of the paintings as
they have developed into the
unmistakable, helter-skelter style
that we recognise today.

Imperial College Conservatives
have snubbed yet another
prominent T o r y M P . Teresa
Gorman, a prominent euro-
sceptic, was left to wander
around Imperial College last
Wednesday after no one turned
up to greet her.
She was expecting to address
a meeting of the Conservative
Society, who had asked her to
speak on the subject of Europe.
However, in what has been seen
as an act of sheer ineptitude, the
Conservative Society was
unaware of her visit. Speaking to
F E L I X shortly after M r s
Gorman left, Ian Bayley,
Chairman of the Conservative
Society was horrified at the
blunder. "There has been a
dreadful misunderstanding," he
announced.
Jill Brown, Secretary to Mrs
Gorman, was angered by the
incompetence of the Conser-
vative Society. She also
announced that Mrs Gorman was
furious and would not be
returning to Imperial College.
"We w i l l be b i l l i n g the
Conservative Society, for M r s
Gorman's Taxi fare to Imperial",
she added.
In an attempt to limit the
damage, M r Bayley, issued a
statement on behalf of the
Conservative Society. H e
defended the society declaring
that 'we would like to apologise
to I C U for any embarrassment
caused. The incident was caused
by a breakdown i n commun-
ication with M r s Gorman's
Private Office'.
On Yer Bike
The Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea have
launched a scheme to increase
the number of local cycle routes.
They have produced a
consultation leaflet suggesting a
range of possible paths for
cyclists throughout the borough.
New routes could be enforced
along Old Brompton and Fulham
Roads, and up Exhibition Road
from South Kensington Station
to Hyde Park.
Alex Reed, Director of
Highways and traffic, has said
that they are anxious to get
feedback from Imperial students.
The leaflet is designed as part of
an ongoing consultation process,
but he explained that they are
compiling their initial report in
March, and would like responses
as soon as possible. A number of
options are available, but he
indicated that the most favoured
solution was to introduce
'advisory' cycle lanes. Mandatory
bike-only routes seem to be a less
likely option. Leaflets are
available from the union office.

f M % • « hours left u n t i l
^ • D ^ o* papers come down, a
plethora of candi-
dates have declared themselves.
Only Rachel Walters, standing
for the post of F E L I X Editor
and P r i n t U n i t Manager, is
uncontested as F E L I X went to
press.
Last week's Presidential
speculation has been proved
accurate, with both Miles
A m b l e r and Sarah W h i t e
battling Kevin Ward for the post.
A n uncontested battle has
also turned into a three horse
race in the contest for Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies).
J o i n i n g M a r y a m Yahyani is
L u k e Gietzen and T i m
Townend.
However, there has been no
change in the Deputy President
(Finance & Services) contest,
only Matthew Crompton and
A n n i e Matthewman are
presently standing, although
Simon Govier, is still believed to
be eyeing up the post.
Papers come down at 5pm
today. New Election w i l l be
standing for all posts.

Artfully Ignorant
In Incoming, Michael quotes a
phrase I've heard many times
since coming to Imperial, used by
scientists to prove their wider
wisdom vs arts students: "I've
heard of Turner and seen a
Picasso - how many arts students
have heard of Feynman or the
second law of thermodynamics?"
I believe this to be flawed on
several levels. The spurious
quoting of random artists is no
different to somebody claiming
knowledge of science via a coffee
table book on H a w k i n g or
Einstein. Just because you have
heard of D a l i and seen some
postcards, doesn't mean that you
understand his work, his
motivation, his context in the
history of art etc. Scientists see
these as irrelevancies. Looking
for formulas and rules and
finding none they assume -not
that they have a lack of
understanding of the artist - but
that they know all there is to
know about him.
As scientists, we are all aware
that there is more to the science
of robotics than Robocop or to
black holes than 'wormholes in
time'. But that is just the attitude
we take towards art. We judge
harshly science as portrayed in
popular culture and yet we apply
the same wayward thinking to
fields other than our own.
O f course there is a basic
aesthetic beauty to a painting that
can be comprehended regardless
of knowledge of art or the artist.
But one should realise that this
experience is ultimately no more
representative of an under-
standing of art then, say, taking a
bus to college is to mechanical
engineering.
Get Into Gear
For the last ten years I've argued
with people about cars. I think
that the scheme proposed in Lisa
Rajan's article is the first that can
counteract both the 'what about
bringing a lot of shopping home?'
and the 'but driving is so much
fun' arguments. It doesn't combat
the 'I wanna big bad Jag to piss
all over the neighbour's Volvo'
line of reasoning but people have
to realise that things are
changing. The law of the road is
under review - why not adopt
these schemes and go find a new
phallic symbol to thrust about in.
May I suggest an enormous
banana hat?
