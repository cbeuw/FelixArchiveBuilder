Visiting Jerusalem was the
experience of a lifetime,
especially for someone who has
never been given the honour of
visiting his homeland before - a
place every Palestinian considers
as a home for pride, prosperity
and identity.
M y dream of v i s i t i n g
Palestine had grown up with me.
I felt that, by visiting Palestine, I
would not only be fulfilling the
dream of my childhood, but, i n
doing so, I would, feel that it was
my turn in life to step on the soil
on which my grandfathers lived
and died, seeking the smell of
liberty. I always wanted to see the
house where my father was
brought up, the tombs of
relatives who long hoped of
seeing us make this visit, the
people of steadfastness, friends
who I knew over the telephone,
the streets called after my cousins
who fell, martyrs, in the Intifada,
and the camps of honour and
dignity in which inhabitants live
under sub-human conditions.
But, most important of a l l , I
wanted to visit my village, which
I had long heard about.
M y dream was over-
shadowed by tasting the agony of
those repelling peace and those
dreaming of its success. Their
problems have cured the pains of
others. However, their wounds
can no longer be the cures for the
aching peace; their message is
"let us make it together... or let
us bury it and kiss it goodbye!"
But the wave of their
message does not seem to
propagate to the ears of those
l i n k i n g their days with their
nights building 'enclosures' or, as
the world wishes to call them,
settlements.
M y dream was reduced to
ashes when I saw the Israeli
authorities still trying their best
to b r i n g the dignified Pales-
tinians down to their knees i n
everyday life. I was shocked to
see the Israelis dig deep down
into the Arab land, trying to
extend the dreams of many,
offering the best of life for
Israelis while adding more
bloody pages to the chapters of
Palestinian misery; offering a
first-class life to a 'first-class
nation' at the expense of the
fifth-class humans, as they wish
them to be.
The extension of such
'enclosures' has done nothing but
increased my doubts about the
enemy of the past. A n enemy
coated with a 'live for peace'
slogan. I become more doubtful
when the enemy is keen to
extend settlements on lands it
should be withdrawing from.
However, the most distur-
bing experience of my visit was
when I was looking anxiously for
ruins of my grandfather's houses
in my village Aqer (Al-Ramla).
There were no ruins, and no
Palestinians, and not even a trace
of willingness by the 'imported'
inhabitants of my village to
welcome under the will of peace.
Instead I was asked to leave the
village by an 'Ethiopian' Jew,
whose agony and the Jewish will
improved his knowledge of
geography and encouraged h i m
to move to Palestine. H e and
others could not accept my visit,
which reminded them that this
land is not theirs. Nevertheless,
my great-great-grandchild will
one day make the same journey.
Despite these bitter exper-
iences, I was honoured to see
some bright figures in Jerusalem,
Gaza, the West Bank and B i r
Zeit. Such figures are ready to
tell the whole world that an
imposed peace is a rejected one,
and a peace dictated and tailored
by the Israelis is not and will not
be just.
T h i s should always be
remebered by the nation which
suffered Hitler's Holocaust, but
now shamelessly reflects (thr-
ough some of its figures) horri-
fying acts of hypocrisy and
arrogance on the helpless
Palestinians.
Violence is always the
result of violence and supp-
ression. A n d any peace formula
imposed at the expense of the
Palestinians will leave the Israelis
with harder questions to solve.
