(i) the hurl of inspiration
carter usm
They enter to a backing tape of the
track 'University' - a child's voice
warbling around the ether, perhaps
in wonder, perhaps just because
he's alive. "All done, all done" he
ends, then his mother becomes
visible on the stage and as the tape
stops the throwing muses start.
It's an explosion of sound.
David Narcizo's drums crash out so
hard that Berend Georges' bass
and Kristin Hersh's guitar are
almost left looking for the space to
play in. 'Teller' and 'Bright Yellow
Gun' are quickly dealt with and it
becomes obvious that this is not
going to be • night for delicate
things. But it's not so much the
noise or volume that is surprising,
rather it's both these linked to the
speed of delivery. Kristin skewers
through the lyrics, compacting them
together and spitting them out.
Live, the Muses are a glittering
sharp edge.
Then strangely for a band
whose current album is easily their
bestseller, they head into back
canon country. The crowd get a bit
confused; you can tell because they
start clapping during the pause in
'Counting Backwards'. When the
band finally get to finish it,
applause in the right place, Kristin
just says "thank you very much"
before muttering something about
'playing some current ones'. And
so they go on to devastate 'Start',
'Hazing' and 'Shimmer' before
falling back in time to albums past.
And you just realise how far
they've come as a band. Greatness
isn't just now, it's then and taking
your audience with you to now,
which is exactly what the Throwing
Muses have done. Every song they
played belonged to them and you
just instinctively knew it. They didn't
play any songs from Kristin's solo
album either.
By the time we get to 'Hook in
her Head' Kristin has worked
everyone into a state where the
quieter tracks from 'University', for
all their beauty, are not going to
played. "Making babies in the
field" she screams and it's
something primeval and intense.
Just as the lyrics are screed down
jagged paths so the drums and
bass become mantric in aspect.
They play one new song, unnamed,
but it turns like serpent swallowing
the still breathing form of rock 'n'
roll and regurgitating something
new. It heralds the start of the
Muses' escape into psychobilly
territory. During the time of their
'Hunkpapa' album and before,
people thought the Muses were an
art house, shoutabout band but
F E L I X DFEB9S
tonight it all makes sense. As Kristin
growls like an banshee from on
high so the crowd only want more.
We've not heard most of this before
but we're true believers now.
They brings us down slowly.
'Two steps' - the gorgeous end of
the 'Real Ramona' album shivers
whatever remains of our fears
before Kristin says "that's all, good
night, god bless" and walks off. It's
only ten thirty and we're broken for
all the right reasons.
I'm no carter usm fan, in fact
I haven't ever really got into them,
so I approached their latest album
•worry bomb with slight hesitation
and didn't really expect much.
I started listening and was
pleasantly surprised at the first
song, 'Cheap'n'Cheesy'. It's one of
those sad, depressive type songs
that everyone seems to enjoy, with
nothing but a piano ringing out a
note or two while the lyrics go on
about being lost.
There are a lot of different
styles here. Typically distorted
guitar sounds of alternative pop
interlink with some brilliant lyrics,
especially in 'The Life and Soul Of
The Party' - "...the funeral director
geezer comes not to bury Caesar..."
This is one of the best songs of the
album, along with the calm
melodies of 'Ceasefire' and 'Going
Straight' and the almost grungy
'Senile Delinquent'.
Overall this album is
recommended for anyone who has
even a slight interest in Carter. And
even if you don't, get it anyway -
you may just become interested. (7)
This is one cd which can be
judged by its cover. The
flamingoes' new album, plastic
jewels, has a daft photo of a kid in
a superman suit on the outside,
three pictures of short-haired
'moody' blokes on the inside. "I bet
this sounds like Blur", I said, and I
was right. The twelve songs which
comprise 'plastic jewels' are all
melodic pop jaunts in the far too
trendy style of Blur, Supergrass and
Radiohead. Some of the lyrics are
fairly depressing but it's the sort of
album you can put on as
background music without anyone
objecting.
To be honest, the songs aren't
anything special because there are
just so many bands around who
sound like this, but if you can't wait
for the next Blur album, this would
probably keep you sane. The
Flamingoes have a lot of potential -
let's see if they can develop their
own style for the next album (6). 0
