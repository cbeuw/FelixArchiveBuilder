Imperial College has settled in
full with its insurers concerning
the St Mary's fraud scandal. The
college has been recompensed
from the insurance company
under its Employee F i d e l i t y
Policy.
The embezzlement of funds
is alleged to have been carried
out by cashier, Cyril D'Souza,
who has reportedly gambled all
of the money away ( F E L I X
1006). Criminal and civil actions
are at present being undertaken
though it is unlikely that the
insurers will regain the money.
Despite college receiving
'one hundred per cent payment'
it remains acutely embarrassed
by the affair, and still refuses to
disclose the sum that was taken.
It was originally reported that
the amount was £652,840.58
though college authorities have
refused to confirm this. Michael
Hansen, Director of Finance,
said: "It doesn't matter, college
received all the money back, and
it is not important to disclose a
sum." M r Hansen added that the
amount will not be published in
the next audited accounts. He
was only willing to admit was
that it was a 'serious fraud'
which occurred over the past five
years.
Questions have been asked
throughout college as to why the
embezzlement took so long to
uncover, and why college has
been so secretive over the affair.
A n external audit is carried out
every year, but it failed to
uncover the fraud. St Mary's
accountants, Price Waterhouse,
now also audit Imperial College
accounts. W h e n asked i f he
thought the firm was negligent,
David Thomson, Head Internal
Auditor for College said, "I
couldn't possibly comment on
that" but added that "things may
well arise from the independent
review."
Touche Ross, is due to
submit this review to the Audit
Committee on the 24th
February.

Entry Changes
B Y K I M B E R L Y W E N T Z L A F F
Prospective students may find a
radically different university
admissions system as early as the
1997/98 academic year, based on
A-level results rather than
predicted grades.
The change is possible after
an unanimous vote by the
Committee of Vice Chancellors
and Principals ( C V C P ) on 12
January to move towards a post
A-level system. When asked why
the C V C P has now begun
investigating options, Ted Nield,
C V C P spokesman, said: "There
was a general feeling that the
system of predicting grades was
coming under strain because of
expansion, and that it
unnecessarily put students
through the mill."
Consequently, the CVCP has
formed two subgroups to look at
ways to reform the system. The
first which is expected to make a
proposal by this summer, will
look at the timetable of the new
system and how it will effect the
next academic year.
The second CVCP subgroup
w i l l investigate ways to use
information technology to
alleviate dead time in the system
and speed the exam grading
process. T h i s emphasis on
technology and speed, however,
has been met with opposition by
the Standing Conference of
Principals (SCOP). In a
statement, it argues that a
'computer-driven post-results
system would be impersonal,
assigning applicants to
institutions without interview
and without regard to students'
personal characteristics and
aptitudes, which are still given
high priority in SCOP colleges'.
Concern has also been
expressed as to whether it was
appropriate for the w o r k i n g
groups to look only at a post-
qualifications system. The
committee was reassured,
however, that the subgroups are
investigating all options to
improve the current system.
On the other hand, Professor
Peter Richards, Dean of St
Mary's, supports the move to a
post-qualifications system. Prof
Richards has announced the
publishing, in two weeks time, of
research on student selection
which indicates that a post-
results system would be fairer to
students. H e also said that a
reformed system would be easier
for universities too.
Peter Mee, College Registrar,
did not know how this would
effect Imperial, but did say that
the college would be watching
the proposals closely.

C o u n c i l l o r for the L o n d o n
Borough of Havering, chose to
hide behind the previous
decision to mislead Imperial. He
repeatedly denied that he, as an
individual, had lied.
When questioned whether
the incident will have any effect
on his campaign to become
University of L o n d o n U n i o n
( U L U ) President, Ghassan
forcefully replied: "Why should
it? W h y should it?" W i t h his
only opposition for the
sabbatical post being New
Election, Karian admitted that
he "should get a good result".
The controversy over the
taking last term of the King's
mascot, a stone lion called
Reggie, continues with the Royal
College of Science Union still in
possession of the sought after
article.
M r Karian has insisted that
his Union will not regain Reggie
through any form of payment,
the usual result of mascotry
activities. Ghassan dismissed
mascotry donations saying: "It
isn't going to involve us handing
over 100 pints of blood, or
£10,000 for charity or anything
stupid like that." In what will
undoubtedly prove to be a
controversial statement i n
King's College, M r Karian said
that if the mascot could not be
retrieved through discussions,
then the stone lion would remain
in Imperial, 'in perpetuity'.
