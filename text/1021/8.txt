Clued Up
Frater Fiam writes
It seems that the twilight streets are
a-crowded with flower porting
minions. As such types strategise
their sleazy unions for one night
only, they remain blatantly
H o n o u m b l e C J w s u l t s
Reader, your devilish friend has
gone to extraordinary lengths of
machiavellism, duplicity in the
extreme, to acquire a copy of the
top secret "MP's guide to politically
correct abuse". O h yes! Never
again will you be flummoxed by the
scorn relentlessly hurled in the
Westminster playpen. So here it is -
unaware of those battling to pass
through those hordes and pass a
quietly colour-bound journey
through the metropolis. Whilst
these types are blinded by their
dreams of consecrating their
obsessive desire in the highest and
yet most base manner, your good
Frater does not indulge in such
frivolity; it would be unfaithful for I
to do so.
Thus must I remain amidst
the cloying fumes of rain dripped
darkness, stalking the streets
ablacked and of unknown
purposes. Yea, the daemons must
be invoked on this night of nights,
and it is that necessity that leads
your Frater to his streetwise battles.
Is there any easy way through
the ABC of politically expedient insults:
Anabiosis - 'Revival after appa-
rent death'. A habitual peculiarity
exhibited by President Heseltine.
Berk - An abbreviation for the coc-
kney rhyming slang, Berkshire Hunt.
Cad - 'Personage of lowly stock
harbouring lofty pretensions'.
these crowds? Such an answer is
provided by the skills of invisibility,
and a practical method for this was
first proposed by the scissorwise
William 'Tell' Burroughs. It was he
that claimed an ability to walk the
streets of Tangiers without being
accosted by a single sordid hawker.
His technique was the embodiment
of simplicity; to see others before
they see you. Such techniques are
worthy of practice, resulting in
unusual efficiency. Your Frater has
proposed a method of 'interv-
entionist invisibility'. In such a
method, although others are
unaware of one's presence, they
will still clear a way for one. This
provides a rapid mode of transit
thro' even the most crowded of
Perhaps this might describe certain
members of HM's opposition.
Emphoteric - 'To act both ways'.
Akin to the Tory policy on Europe.
Fabulist - 'Euphemism for liar'. An
essential prerequisite for aspiring
demagogues.
Glabrous - 'A surface devoid of
hair'. A barb frequently directed at
follicularly challenged politicians,
notably of both sexes.
Harridan - 'Haggard old woman'.
A derivative of the French word
haridelle meaning a worn out
horse. Now which shadow health
minister could that be I wonder?
Jactation - 'Bragging'. Remin-
iscent of Labour, pre general
election 1992.
Lickspittle - 'Sycophant'. Distinctly
peculiar to the Tory back-bencher.
Milksop - 'An effeminate person'.
Aka a 'Eunuch', someone devoid of
political genitalia.
Nescience - 'Ignorance'. Argu-
ably, something MPs often excrete
with a superlative ease.
Otiose - 'Functionless'. Often used
to describe nepotistic QUANGOS.
paves. Molly, the mirror shaded
samurai, was a master at this skill.
And in this manner, unseen
as the night itself and yet able to
rule the destinies of others for a
subtle moment at least, your Frater
advances his contemplation
unhindered by the lives and loves
of those that intrude. Such solitude
provides a tranquil ability to ponder
both the grand and the incon-
sequential with equal fervour. A
simple pondrance which he
encountered recently was the
synchronous correspondence
between a pair of otherwise
unrelated words, and he would
leave you with these. One question
remains however; is this connection
causal, or is it merely casual?
Pudendum - 'of the genitals'. The
sophisticate's label for a Berk.
Q u a q u a v e r s a l - 'Pointing or
facing in every direction'.
Synonymous with Liberal Democracy.
Rodomontade - 'Arrogant rant-
ing'. A side effect of political
passion, often seen in the party
activist during conference time.
S l u b b e r b e g u l l i o n - 'A dirty
wretched slob'. Need we say more?
Tergiversate - 'To desert a cause'.
Equivocation is a trait seldom seen
in politics. Oh no.
U l t r a c r e p i d a r i a n - 'Presum-
ptuousness'. Something Lucifer's
chum might be accused of.
Virago - 'A woman of masculine
spirit'. An iron lady no less.
Alas, the perceptive amongst you
will note that these satanic verses
are not quite complete. This I am
afraid was due to the terribly
offensive nature of said remaining
insults. However, as a parting
thought, I leave you with a famous
quote from a failed Congressional
candidate: "This is democracy. The
people have spoken - the bastards."
