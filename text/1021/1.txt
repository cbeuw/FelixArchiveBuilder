King's President U-Turns on Minibus
BY A N D R E W S M I T H
Ghassan Karian, the prospective
University of L o n d o n U n i o n
President, has this week
confessed that he k n o w i n g l y
misled both the Imperial College
U n i o n President ( I C U ) and
F E L I X . In a dramatic admis-
sion, he acknowledged that his
categorical denial that the King's
College Union minibus had been
involved i n the violent and
destructive attack on Imperial
College was untrue. Ghassan has
now confirmed that he himself
handed over the keys of the
minibus used in the raid.
The remarks concern events
on Saturday February 4th when a
group of 14 students from King's
College entered the I C U building
and caused an estimated £2000
worth of damage. When inter-
viewed by F E L I X after the
attack, M r Karian, the President
of King's College Student Union,
insisted that he had been i n
possession of the minibus' keys
during the incident. In a letter to
Lucy Chothia, I C U President,
last Friday, Ghassan apologised
for the "collective decision to
cover the fact that our minibus
was used".
Speaking to F E L I X follow-
ing the publication of this letter,
Ghassan confessed that he had
knowingly and deliberately given
false information to both I C U
and F E L I X concerning the
incident. H e conceded that he
had personally handed over the
keys to the group, knowing that
they were planning to travel en
masse to Imperial College.
After admitting that the he
had knowingly misled F E L I X
about the m i n i b u s , Ghassan
denied that he had lied
personally, suggesting that he
was 'following a line'. Possibly
with a view to the U L U election
early next month, the King's
President stressed that each of
the four members of the King's
Sabbatical team had agreed with
the 'collective decision' to cover
up this detail of the incident.

NUS Motion Fails - No Referendum
BY A N D R E W T S E N G ,
NEWS E D I T O R
Imperial students were this week
denied the opportunity to vote on
joining the National U n i o n of
Students (NUS).
A motion calling for a
college wide referendum on
affiliation to the N U S was
narrowly defeated on techni-
calities at Monday's meeting of
Imperial College Union's (ICU)
Council.
Proposed by Lucy Chothia,
ICU President, and seconded by
Ian Parish, I C U Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies), the
motion would have given I C U its
first college wide ballot on
affiliation to the N U S in almost
twenty years. In 1977, the anti-
NUS campaign won by five votes
after 1584 were cast, taking I C U
out of the national student body.
At Monday's C o u n c i l
meeting, although those present
agreed with the calling of a
referendum, there was concern
that referendum campaigns
would clash with the sabbatical
election campaigns. Members
suggested that this might result
in sabbaticals being elec-
ted simply on whether they
were pro- or anti-NUS.
The recently passed cons-
titution lays down strict rules on
referendum procedures. Once
Council or a petition of 200 I C U
members has decided to hold a
referendum, notice of the
referendum must be given within
two college days and the campus
wide ballot held twenty to
twenty-five days later. W i t h
voting usually taking place on a
Monday or Tuesday, the ballot
would have taken place the week
after the sabbatical elections or
during the last week of term.
T h o u g h M s C h o t h i a was
obviously disappointed that the
motion was not passed, Council
is understood to favour a college
wide referendum.
The motion is expected to be
re-proposed at the next meeting
of Council which takes place in a
month.
