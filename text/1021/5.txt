Dear Owain,
I am also shit scared of a member
of college being involved in an
accident. I am shit scared of that
member of college being me.
However it is being scared that
makes me a cautious climber.
While agreeing wholeheartedly
with the main thrust of Ian Parish's
article; (that anyone participating in
a 'dangerous' activity should be
aware of the risks involved and
shout if they are concerned) ; I
would like to add to his point that
mountaineering has an ethos of
"individual initiative and self
reliance."
To some extent this is true, but
when climbing as a pair or trio (as
opposed to walking) individuals are
transformed into a team, a single
unit, each part dependant on the
others. When I go climbing with
someone I put my life in their
hands and theirs is in mine; the
object above all is that the team
comes off the hill together, safely.
Part of the reason for an
"unapproachable Club
atmosphere" is surely an
expectation from people outside of
the club that a certain level of
experience and knowledge is
required, whereas all that is
required is a keenness to learn and
push the everyday realm of
experience a little. A questioning
attitude is therefore certainly
welcomed.
Julian Rickard
Mountaineering Club President
For those who didn't read lan's
article last week about the safety of
certain Clubs and Societies he
advised those who were worried
about activities to ask questions,
make a fuss, go see him, and not
stay quiet. I think it was good for the
Mountaineering club to write in.
Somebody obviously cares about
safety. However it is a shame that
we have to be told to ask questions,
and to challenge judgements rather
than always knowing that we must
not accept what we are told or hear,
and that we can change things, on
our own or as a pair, a trio...

Dear FELIX,
In response to Tim St. Clair's
criticism of my letter last week as
"uncalled-for-one-manship", my
main aim was to counteract what
my members saw as biased and
unfactual reporting at the clashing
visits of Tony Benn and David Hunt.
For his information many LabSoc
members have turned up to our
speaker events and I have asked
my committee members to
accompany me to any future
LabSoc events that do not clash
with ours.
The members of both societies
are quite ready to listen to
alternative views. Indeed, we are
nowhere near as narrow-minded
as people such as Tim. He clearly
prefers to isolate himself from the
democratic debate by supporting
the pseudo-intellectual (complete
with long sentences, none of which
are grammatically decipherable)
anarchism of Craig Davies on the
same page and dispensing Lib Dem
like platitudes to both parties
when, as I have explained, are
completely ignorant of the good
relations between us.

Conservative Society Chairman
You have a bee in your bonnet Ian.
Let's get things straight shall we? If
you and the rest of the populace
"were ready to listen to alternative
views", we wouldn't be in the sticky
state that we are in.
We fight, we have wars, pitch
invasions and politicians constantly
mouth off about how wonderful
they are and how bad the others
are. By always picking on little
differences we are not solving the
problems that gape between us.
How about a joint LabSoc, ConSoc
pub crawl with politics off the
agenda?

Dear Felix,
How can Mr Theocharis feel
justified in making such rash claims
in last week's Gatecrash column?
He boldly states when referring to
Russell and Popper, 'They never cut
across the path of speeding trucks;
they never jumped unprotected
from great heights."
Where, one wonders, does Mr
Theocharis find the evidence for
this? Could it not in fact be the
case that Russell regularly cut in
front of speeding trucks, and yet
survived unharmed? Has he not
read accounts of Karl Popper's
infamous "Cliff Leaping"
experiments? Only the other day
an associate recounted his
witnessing of such an event: "We
watched, as Karl stood at the tenth
storey window. He leapt into space,
seeming to remain there for an
immeasurable time, before hitting
the pavement with the sound of a
gunshot. Standing up, he then
dusted himself down and walked
off unharmed leaving only a
Popper shaped dent in the paving
stones."
Surely this is evidence enough
of Russell's justification in abusing
the theory of inductive reasoning.
Russell is no more a bird brain, Mr
Theocharis, than you or I.

Forgive me, for I am only a mere
mortal, but what are you on about?
Can I suggest a fiction column, or
maybe even a novel.
Edited this week by Michael Ludlam
On another note though, as
bizarre as your story is, maybe it
says something about us Scientists,
Engineers and Medics here. As a
friend said to me; "I bet you that as
Scientists we know a helluva lot
more about the Arts than Arts
students know about the Sciences."
How many Humanities Schools have
a Science programme? We all have
heard of Russell and the rest but
when was the last time you heard a
English Lit. student talk about
Feymann ?

Dear Owain,
Does Rachel Walters really expect
us to be indignant at the sight of
Para poetry?
What does she expect:
"Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
We love hostile civilians,
Particularly joyriders."
Absurd! Equally absurd is the
concept of labelling the individual
bullets fired by a soldier in active
duty, whilst defending his life and
the life of his comrades: "legal,
legal, legal, murder."
Then again, I have no doubt
that, faced with a car speeding
towards her and containing either
terrorists, or joyriders whose
favourite sport is attract police fire
by 'clipping' (i.e. running over)
British soldiers, Rachel would hold
her fire...
...After all, does she not share
the nationality and creed of the
driver?

/ am sorry but your tasteless remarks
are not welcome with me. Have you
visited Ireland, North and South? Or
are you like many of the bigots who
go mouthing off about how they
know best, but know nothing at all.
Parody does not do you or your
arguments any justice and nor does
making accusations about creed
(which are false incidentally). It is
this kind of language that got us
into the mess that we are all
implicated in.
A suggestion Manor - read
around the subject, think about your
views, discuss with your friends,
battle it out and then write back and
tell us how you got on...
Letters may be commented on by a
guest editor, whose opinions may
not be those of the editor, and may
be cut d u e to space restrictions.
Deadline: Monday 6.00pm.
