This week you finally lose
your virginity. Awwww yeah.
It was beautiful. It was hum-
bling. It was awe inspiring.
You were definitely on top
form, although you don’t
know what exactly top form
is... You wake from your
dream with cum all over you,
and realise you fell asleep in
your exam. Awkward.
This week you just can’t
shake off that feeling that
someone is stalking you.
You feel eyes on the back of
your head. You can feel them
burning a hole in your head.
“GO COMPAREEEEEE”. The
Go Compare man is behind
you with a knife. He stabs
you and displays your corpse
in the Library.
This week you start shag-
ging your personal tutor in
an attempt to get extra marks
on your upcoming exam.
They’re into some seriously
weird shit. You just hold
your snorkle and take it, it’s
for the greater good. It turns
out your tutor has no power
and didn’t even set the exam.
Week wasted.
This week Neptune and Ura-
nus are finally aligned. This
means your anus will finally
align with a hot piece of ass.
Boom. Shame your partner
has a praying mantis fetish
and eats off your head after.
You die with a smile on your
face, knowing you may get
giving an honorary first. Or at
least hoping. Pint?
This week you let down gen-
erations of your family by not
getting 80% in your group
project. You really sicken me
you do. You think you can
walk in here and just have
fun at university. FUN. FUN!?
Don’t you know this is Impe-
rial. Fun was never an option
here. On your bike to the Li-
brary.

K, bk. How r u? Lol. U Fb
msg every1 u no. U get 0
dates frm it. Soz. Ttyl. Cya.
xxxxxxxxxx
This week you’re a bar of
soap. You really have a tough
life. All that happens is your
used by men to rub their
sweaty genitals. Some even
use you for lubrication when
they’re taking a long shower
that they think is so subtle
that their housemates won’t
realise they’re wanking. Be-
ing a bar of soap is hard. :(
This week Mars has moved
into the war position. This
means exams are on the hori-
zon and you must guard your
computer with your life. Hav-
ing found one spare machine
in a training room you for-
tify it with armed guards and
barbed wire. You get over-
thrown in a coup and have to
live in exile on Queen’s Lawn.
This week you finally get add-
ed by your secret crush on
Snapchat. You immediately
start a strict grooming regime
(no more greasy foods etc) to
look your best. You also look
up lighting effects to make
everything seem bigger just in
case. Turns out you were add-
ed by accident, and they talk
like they’re on MSN in 2000.
This week you start frantically
stroking the mightly sword in
the toilets. Awwwww yeah.
The soap jumps from your
hand and goes under your
foot. You slip and break your
arm. Now you have to scream
for help from your house-
mates knowing they’ll walk in
to see you standing to atten-
tion. Wouldn’t happen at UCL.
This week the library printer
is so fed up of printing badly-
written coursework that it swal-
lows you whole and holds
you hostage in paper tray 2. It
starts flashing error messages
in Morse code to communicate
the ransom for your release,
but no one understands so it
drowns you in ink and spits you
out while flashing ‘paper jam’.
This week you have to de-
cide between having to drink
straight vodka for the rest of
your life and having penises
for limbs. Your permanent
state of intoxication could be
fun, but you may be an annoy-
ing drunk. The penises would
make you individual, but peo-
ple would jack you off by ac-
cident. What’s it going to be?
