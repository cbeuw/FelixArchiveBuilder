Imperial College London students to dominate
Engineers Without Borders Finals
Eoghan J Totten Reporter
hree teams of prospective year two
students dominated a 2,500 strong
national ﬁeld from thirteen Universi-
ties to secure a place in the Engineer-
ing Without Borders Challenge Finals
taking place at Coventry University
next month. he teams, consisting
of individuals from multidisciplinary
backgrounds (outside of Engineer-
ing) endeavoured to solve complex
problems aﬀecting the impoverished
community of An Minh, Vietnam. All
work was co-ordinated in context of
the ‘Global Challenges’ ﬁeld of Impe-
rial Horizons. heir success manifests
the core skill bases championed by
Imperial Horizons tutors; many hope
that it will mark the inception of more
future success related to the ancillary
courses.
he project took place over an eight
week time frame. he students were
essentially left to their own devices, be-
ing required to assimilate a system for
solving a problem aﬀecting An Minh,
Vietnam. he students proved that
they were commensurate to the task
by hypothesising their own question
and then creatively solving it. While
the project required a signiﬁcant com-
ponent of Engineering the organisers
stress those team players from non-
Engineering disciplines were invalu-
able, contributing to the cohesion that
delivered success in competition. Two
PhD students mentored and chan-
nelled the eﬀorts of the students, li-
aising with the teams to construct a
portfolio recording the design process.
Raunaq Bagchi, one of the students
that competed, said: “he Engineers
Without Borders Challenge has been
a great exercise from the start. he
process of coming up with ideas and
running through all the possibilities
to try and design the best solution
for people in other parts of world, is
a great way to open one’s eyes to the
troubles many face. Now entering the
ﬁnal stages of the competition, I would
say it’s a bonus and an opportunity to
see how our designs appeal to experts
in the ﬁeld.”
he fruits of their labour were pre-
sented to judges at the national com-
petition and as mentioned above three
of the four teams will proceed to the
Finals. he dominant team from each
university is entitled to a place with
seven additional places awarded based
on merit. As cited by one Imperial Ho-
rizons member of staﬀ,
“It is…an outstanding achievement
that in our ﬁrst year of running the
Challenge we have managed to take
two of those additional seven places.”
As well as the competition the stu-
dents will be oﬀered opportunities to
participate in ‘innovative’ workshops
that seek to convey living conditions in
An Minh and how the local commu-
nity will beneﬁt from the endeavours
of the students.
Congratulations are in order for the
following individuals (see box), who
have served as remarkable ambassa-
dors for Imperial College London and
highlight the potential of the intellec-
tual arsenal imparted to students while
studying at the university.
Imperial Horizons extended an in-
vitation to anyone interested in next
year’s Engineering Without Borders
competition – it is required that they
enrol for the ‘Global Challenges: Engi-
neers Without Borders Challenge’ on
the website enrolment page. Applica-
tions close on June 6th.
