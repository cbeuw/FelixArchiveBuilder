We set oﬀ bright and early from Im-
perial College Union meeting at 7am
on Saturday 23rd March 2013. Fifteen
Fellwanderers packed into the mini-
bus with all their kit secured on the
roof and tents, gas stoves, ice axes,
the beast pot and more as well. After a
lengthy stop in North London to ﬁght
with a tyre inflating compressed air
machine we sped up the M1 – which
had enough snow to convince us we
were already in Scotland – and on to
the M6, stopping at Birmingham for a
greasy spoon fried breakfast. Passing
the Peaks and Lakes we soon crossed
the border and stopped for a break at
Gretna Green village, stocking up at
the Cadbury factory outlet store. he
journey continued between the tower
blocks and industrial sprawl of Glas-
gow up to the beautiful Loch Lomond
and beyond into the Highlands. As the
gale force side-winds lashed the bus
we were all speechless, either from the
beautiful scenery or the ruined van
and coach that had seemingly been
ripped from the road and rolled into
the frozen lake to our side. To ease the
journey we ﬁlled the bus with a half
week’s food and continued under the
veil of darkness, blissfully ignorant of
the perilous conditions outside, arriv-
ing safe and sound at 11.45pm.
he Bothy (constructed ‘on a budg-
et’ with solid stone walls and a mea-
gre hardwood ceiling beneath sheet
metal to ensure eﬃcient heat loss)
nestles itself on the shores of Little
Loch Broom, in the wee village of
Badrallach, which was comfortably
enjoying a sub-zero yet sunny and
dry climate.
Sunday morning we rose early
munching granola and drinking tea,
with a tantalising view of the snow
capped An Tealach massif across
the Loch basking in sun. We walked
from the Bothy climbing the ridge
immediately behind us which formed
a peninsula spiking towards the At-
lantic ocean. We summited both
Cnoc a’ Bhaid-rallach (544m) and
Beinn Ghobhlach (635m), escaping
the harsh winds to enjoy a sandwich
picnic huddled between some rocks.
We strolled down to Scoraig Village,
which is accessed by boat across the
Loch (no road); some 50 people live
there, with well-drawn water, elec-
tricity from windmills, and neat lit-
tle houses where phone and TV sig-
nals do not reach… a real contrast to
London. We wandered back around
the coast to our new home for a slice
of Hello Kitty cake and then a clas-
sic cheesy chorizo pasta meal with
a few beers. here was a good sized
table and chairs to eat around but we
were a bit cosy with 15 squeezed in,
though the comfy sofa and roaring
ﬁre kept us happy. After hot showers
it was time for bed, where two sleep-
ing bags was the only way to keep
warm!
Monday we were hungry to en-
ter the mountains, hiking from Ca-
musnagul up to Glas Mheall Mor
(979m Munro Top) with a snowy
scramble to the summit, then epic
views to the spikes of the Munros
beyond. We crossed the valley before
heading up Sail Mhor (767m) with
panoramic views of the mountains
behind and the islands and sea in
front. hai green stir-fry and cherry
pie for dinner. Tuesday we journeyed
inland to Iverlael Bridge (on A835)
climbing the snowy ridge up to the
white-out that was Eididh nan Clach
Geala (927m Munro), slowly picking
our way down the icy decent we had
lunch by the frozen fords and then
retreated down the valley via Loch
an Chnapalch. A delicious beef curry
with rice and naan was prepared at
the bothy and much fun was had.
Wednesday was a rest day for most,
some basked in the sun with books
at the bothy, others made a tour of
the highlands, visiting gorges, water-
falls, distilleries, the glorious Morray
Fellwanderers Chill Out for Easter
Jack Redvers Harris
Fellwanderers President
Fellwanderers Easter Tour to the Snowy Scottish Highlands
Firth suspension bridge and picking
up some shopping in the bleak city of
Inverness. Others took a walk from
nr. Loch a Bhrucin (on A832) up to
Meall a’ Chrasgaidh (934m Munro)
and Carn na Criche (961m tour
high point), with spectacular views
of Sgurr nan Clach Gaela (1093m),
before heading back down via Coire
Breabig after bailing on Sgurr Mor
(1108m) summit attempt. he mini-
bus journey back passed by many
wild peat ﬁres, caused by the strong
sun and dry conditions, with flames
and smoke ﬁlling the valley. A deli-
cious pork and dumplings meal was
prepared with trifle for dessert over
which many tales of old where told.
hursday we enjoyed a hearty fry-
up breakfast, fuelling folks with en-
ergy. One group climbed from Tor-
ran Dubh (on A835) up to Beinn
Liath Mhor Fannich (954m Munro)
via Creag Dhubh Fannich, return-
ing via Beinn Laith Bhearg (664m).
Meanwhile another group undertook
an epic journey passing the back of
An Tealach down to the shores of
Loch na Sealga and back. After a
brisk dip in the icy sea loch and a
spot of tea and cake at the bothy, a
traditional Scottish dinner of Haggis
with potato mash and swede was had
in the evening, with many an ale and
cheesecake for dessert.
Friday we woke at 5am to pack
and leave at 7am, driving over three
hours North along “A roads” which
consisted of single-track roads with
occasional passing places, to reach
Ben Hope, the most Northerly Mun-
ro. We eagerly marched from sea
level up the long ride to summit Ben
Hope (927m Munro), before white-
out set in and we found our way back
down the snow to the sunny valley,
before bundling back in the minibus
for a long journey home. We left the
valley at 4pm, stopped for dinner in
Perth at 8pm and returned to Lon-
don for 7am.
