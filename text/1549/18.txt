FRIDAY 31 MAY
Cassette Culture: RRR Records
Riaz Agahi talks to Ron Lessard, head of seminal noise label RRR
A
fter hearing about RRR
records through their
Recycled series, I dis-
covered a contribution
to the development and
proliferation of noise music that goes
far beyond a series of tapes which
brings together some of noise’s most
important artists. Based in Lowell,
Massachusetts, RRR has the distinc-
tion of being the ﬁrst American la-
bel to release Merzow, eﬀectively
globalising noise. Despite that, the
label’s proﬁle is lower than Merzbow
and the like, and this is because rather
than sticking with the artists it helped
establish, the label has relentlessly fo-
cused on new discoveries. his is RRR
records’ truly underground ethos,
which I felt worthy of further exami-
nation, so I got in touch with label
founder and head Ron Lessard.
Riaz Agahi: What motivated you to
start RRR?
Ron Lessard: I’ve been passionate
about record albums since I was a
teenager, it’s a passion that grew into
an obsession – opening a record store
was the natural direction for my life,
it’s the one thing I always cared about
– y’know that old saying about ﬁnding
what you love in life and you’ll never
have to work again? Well, it’s true –
I followed my passion and that’s the
best thing anyone could ever do.
RA: How did you get in touch with
Japanese artists like Merzbow and
Aube?
RL: I didn’t get in touch with them,
they got in touch with me – back in
the day when there was no “scene”, it
was just a bunch of us guys who traded
tapes with one another, there used to
be a number of fanzines and publica-
tions that promoted tape trading and
those guys read about me in a maga-
zine somewhere. I was the American
guy who understood what they were
trying to do so they said hello.
RA: What is it about the cassette that’s
made it so heavily a part of the noise
scene?
RL: At the time, internet didn’t exist
and making records for that weird
recording you made last night was
totally out of the question. Cassettes
were cheap, you could buy them an-
ywhere and most importantly, you
could make them yourself at home –
and because of that, cassettes was the
medium of choice.
Digital technology has changed the
way noise gets disseminated but that
original cassette camaraderie still ex-
ists and it seems to be getting strong-
er – cassette labels are popping up left
and right – I totally understand the
love for cassettes, it’s the need for hu-
man connection – clicking a button to
hear something on your computer is
swell but it could never match the ap-
peal of getting something in the mail
that someone made just for you.
RA: How did the recycled series come
about and do you have any personal
highlights?
RL: Most labels put out cassette af-
ter cassette of the same people – I
wanted to do just 1 cassette by eve-
ryone – as a theme/direction for this
concept, I decided instead of original
works by these artists, I would ask
them to recycle their own or someone
else’s recordings (recycling is remix-
ing, tearing it down and rebuilding
it) – I would then take those recycled
recordings and record them over pre-
existing cassettes – that Twisted Sis-
ter tape got taped over by Merzbow,
the Billy Joel tape is now an Aube
tape.
I no longer ask the artist to make
their master based on recycling/re-
mixing – I’m happy to accept new
original material – I no longer ask
well known and successful artists to
participate in the series, I try to only
release the unknown, unloved, unac-
complished – the new recruits, those
who are just beginning their noise
journey – I see no reason to support
those who are already successful, they
already have their support mecha-
nism in place – the unknown, unloved
have no one who cares and that’s why
I want to use this series as a support
mechanism for the new recruits
here was a time when the noise
scene didn’t exist, everyone was un-
loved and unaccomplished – but
when we found each other, we knew
we had to support each other – now
the noise scene exists but it sill has the
unloved and unaccomplished – they
get my full support, I remember what
it was like when no one cared.
RA: How do you feel the noise scene
has evolved since the beginning and is
it for better or for worse?
RL: Well, the big diﬀerence is the
noise scene actually exists now –
there was a time when only the artists
knew each other and the information
was hard to get out, now the infor-
mation is easy to get out, it happens
every second of every day – and now
there are so many people who listen to
noise for their own personal pleasure,
it no longer revolves around those
with the NEED to make noise – it has
become an acceptable form of expres-
sion and because of that, you have to
take the good and the bad.
RA: Kind of a more general question
is about the origins of noise as a genre.
here were academics like Luigi Rus-
solo at the start of the 20th century
who promoted it as an idea, as kind of
the next step in the evolution of music
because the human ear had become
adjusted to the noise of the urban in-
dustrial environment. But then on
the other hand, there’s more anarchic
genres like punk and grind, which
seem more organic in their approach.
Do you feel it’s a combination of both,
or one in particular or something else
entirely?
RL: I was listening to the academ-
ics before punk and grind were even
genres – and many of the original
noise guys did also – me personally,
I never read that Russolo manifesto,
I don’t care about the theory, I only
really care about the results – does it
speak to me, does it covey a mood or
expression that I can identify with –
all the theory in the word ain’t gonna
make me like it, that’s just some guy
trying to explain himself.
I can certainly appreciate the organ-
ic approach, those guys make noise
because their passion compels them
– I love those guys, its all about bare-
ing your soul.
RA: As kind of an extension of the last
question, how important is industrial?
I’m not a fan of industrial, it sounds
too much like people singing songs
GX Jupitter-Larson (of he Hat-
ers) said it best... “Industrial is sing-
ing about ﬁre, Power Electronics is
screaming about ﬁre, Noise is starting
your own ﬁre.”
RA: Merzbow once said that Western
noise was too academic, do you feel
that there’s major diﬀerences in noise
from each country?
RL: Everyone has their own ideas and
perceptions – some countries do have
their own identity of sorts, no doubt
due to their cultural environment:
England – big on power electronics
Germany – big on power electronics
Japan – big on noise
USA – big on noise
Make of that as you will, I won’t
make any judgements.
RA: his doesn’t really have anything
to do with the interview, but I got this
cassette single with my recycled tapes
that said Autraumatic on the side,
wasn’t sure what this was but it was a
pretty great tape.
RL: Actually this has everything to
do with the interview because it goes
back to my wanting to support the
new recruits – I don’t remember that
cassette but I’m in the habit of giving
away cassettes by unknown artists
whenever I get an order – it’s another
way I support the unloved and un-
cared….
RA: Are there any new artists on
your label you’d especially recom-
mend?
RL: Ha! - all of them.
