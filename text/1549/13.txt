FRIDAY 31 MAY
Stop talking, start interviewing
Ananya Das interviews Sháá Wasmund, the author of Stop Talking,
Start Doing: A Kick in the Pants in Six Parts
Ananya Das: You have a fantastic
entrepreneurial career, have there
been moments when you needed ‘A
Kick in the Pants’ similar to in Stop
Talking, Start Doing? If so, who or
what did you turn to for a bit of en-
couragement or motivation?
Sháá Wasmund: Being constantly
motivated to work hard is one of the
main reasons I’ve managed to act on
my ideas and launch so many busi-
nesses. I managed to keep myself mo-
tivated by surrounding myself with
inspirational and successful people.
Ex Minister for Trade and Chairman
of Dyson Sir Richard Needham has
been my mentor for years and found-
er of the MOBO Awards Kanya King
is a close friend of mine. hese people
don’t achieve phenomenal success by
sitting around. here enthusiasm and
determination to succeed is infec-
tious and deﬁnitely rubbed oﬀ on me.
AD: You have been voted as one of
the UK’s Most Connected Women
by the Institute of Directors – have
you come across much competition
or negativity from male colleagues
in business?
SW: I’ve not really come across any
extra competition from male entre-
preneurs than female ones. My view
is that collaboration is the key to suc-
cess. If I help someone out then if I
need a favour in the future they will
If I help
someone out
then if I need
a favour in the
future they
will be more
inclined to
help me
be more inclined to help me. I think
by genuinely trying to help anyone I
can, I’ve managed to avoid competi-
tion.
AD: A lot of well educated young
graduates are ﬁnding it increasing-
ly difficult to ﬁnd jobs, what advice
would you give them to stand out in
the business world?
SW: Have they thought about start-
ing their own business? hese days
you can set up a website and start a
business from your front room, all
you need is an internet connection.
here’s a brilliant support network
out their for young entrepreneurs
now too, the web provides so much
advice and oﬀers more ways to get in
touch with people than ever before.
So you could argue it’s easier to access
customers and ﬁnd yourself a mentor.
here seems to be so much doom and
gloom about the recession, but I think
young people should take a step back
and try to look at this as a wonderful
opportunity.
AD: Some graduates are deciding
to set up their own businesses. Are
there any top tips you could give for
expanding small businesses?
SW: Collaborate, work hard and
market your hind legs oﬀ. To grow
your business you need to make sure
people know about it. It’s easier and
cheaper than ever to do this. Look at
the tools at your disposable, one ex-
ample being social media – it gives
you a direct line to thousands of cus-
tomers for free.
AD: How much of an emphasis
would you put on ‘networking’ and
‘knowing the right people’?
SW: Getting yourself out there and
meeting people is a huge part of grow-
ing a business. You need to network
and hear ideas from other people.
Locking yourself in a room by your-
self means when you get stuck you
have nowhere to turn. Getting out,
meeting other entrepreneurs who’ve
been through the problem you are
going through means they can show
you how to solve it. It also helps you
to come up with new ideas yourself. If
you’re looking to launch and grow a
business then I’d say get out and net-
work as MUCH as you can.
AD: Many thanks for your time!
There’s a bril-
liant support
network out
there... the
web provides
so much ad-
vice
