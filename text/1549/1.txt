An Imperial alumnus has been killed
in Syria after a bomb hit the ﬁeld hos-
pital where he was treating patients
in challenging conditions. Isa Abdur
Rahman (pictured), 26, was a medi-
cal student at Imperial and was killed
while helping the British charity
Hand In Hand for Syria (HIHS).
Dr Rahman was from North West
London and was married. He had put
his medical career in the UK on hold
to help the civilians hurt by the con-
ﬂict in Syria. Even though he was not
a native Arabic speaker, he managed
to master the language in less than a
year.
He left his job at the Royal Free
Hospital almost a year ago and ﬂew
to Syria to set up a clinic in the village
of Atmeh, near the border of Turkey,
before moving from town to town of-
fering medical help.
he medical library at St Mary’s has
been reopened following six months
of renovation works on the building
and facilities.
he library is to be renamed the
Fleming Library (after Sir Alexander
Fleming).

planned in 1999, cost a total of £3 mil-
lion. Half of this funding was from the
St Mary’s Development Trust.
