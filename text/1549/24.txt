Bringing ink to a gunfight

ey. You. Don’t you
hear the bell? We
need to get out of
here, and fast. I’m
here to help you.
Rule number one: Don’t get me killed.
Wait, where’s your sword? Stick to the
darkness until you ﬁnd it. Good thing
you were out cold, looks like they don’t
know you’re alive. Let’s keep it that way.
Now come on, we’ve got to save Master
Azai!”
And so opens Mark of the Ninja,
a 2D stealth game in which your su-
perhuman senses are not the result of
training or bloodline, but rather from
a powerful toxin injected into the skin.
Tattoos known as: he Marks.
he ﬁrst level takes place at the tail
end of an attack on your clan, led by a
man named Karajan. Starting with only
your amazing senses, but picking up
various pieces of equipment and learn-
ing new moves along the way, your goal
is to assassinate him. his is a matter of
honour, however all may not be quite
as it seems...
he controls are solid, though a little
clunky if using keyboard and mouse.
Personally, I prefer to use an Xbox
360 controller, occasionally using the
mouse for precision, however a little
bit of practice and most people should
be ﬁne with a keyboard and mouse.
he art and music, on the other hand,
are absolutely astonishing. Together
with a few major features in the game-
play (being able to ‘see’ sound, paus-
ing time for short periods, the sheer
number of diﬀerent ways to execute
a stealth kill), these cause a very pow-
erful atmosphere in the game. If, like
me, you’re one of these people who
becomes very invested in a game, you
might even start feeling like a real ninja.
Unfortunately, there are very few
games out there to compare this to –
2D stealth games have only really start-
ed becoming popular with the release
of Mark of the Ninja. However, in com-
parison to 3D stealth games two things
should be noted.
Firstly that the game is more ‘casual’
,
in that it’s much easier to get into. If
you simply want to complete the lev-
els and ﬁnish the story, you can fail all
the time and be detected quite often
but still complete it – only your points
will suﬀer. But if you want to, there’s a
wealth of secondary objectives to com-
plete that turn it from a game that
anyone can complete to one
that few can master.
Secondly, it is also far
less tedious; in my experi-
ence, many stealth games
have a large element of wait-
ing. Whilst this is indeed
present here, guard pa-
trols are short, in order to
minimise the wait. Rush-
ing through a level
will still get you
detected and
decrease your
points, how-
ever you
often need
not wait
long ,

FRIDAY 31 MAY 25

If you’ve been living under a rock
these last two weeks, there was a lot of
hype, building up to the reveal of Mi-
crosoft’s latest console – the last real
contender in the latest saga of the con-
sole wars. As with anything that has
ever had that much anticipation built
up for it, you could hear the joy leav-
ing everyone’s souls, making the noise
like a rudely deflating balloon animal.
It turns out that most people’s worst
fears had become manifest.
here were rumours abound, re-
garding the name of the new console,
and it looks like the community came
up with a better name and branding
(Xbox Inﬁnity) for the console, than
whatever name Microsoft eventu-
ally picked out of a hat. So, we’ve now
got the WiiU, PS4 and now the Xbox
One (now forever known to the Felix
games team as the XBone), so yeah.
Really inventive names, people. You’ve
pushed the boundaries of thought,
by incrementing your console name
by one, adding a letter and wilfully
confusing people with your ﬁrst con-
sole, respectively. What happened to
the time when we had names such as
‘Dreamcast’ and ‘Gamecube’? Heck,
I’d even accept mixing random words
and letters to get new names, like the
‘AssPlayer 128’ or ‘Screaming Eagle X‘,
as that would at least be a less-half-
assed attempt. Wow, didn’t think I’d
moan about the names for that long.
So yeah, onto the real disappointment.
Apparently, everyone in the world
watches TV, or they’ll die – a school
of thought founded by TV Licensing,
and now adopted by Microsoft. Now,
that’s not to say that Netflix, etc aren’t
popular, but trying to advertise your
console because you can watch TV on
it is... well... that’s just stupid. hat’s
what a TV is for.
Unusable gimmicks aside, Kinect is
required for the console to even boot,
so in other word... oh right, unusable
gimmick. Well, I started so I might as
well let myself ﬁnish. Kinect will al-
ways be on, and watching your room
– your supposed to use Kinect com-
mands to turn on your XBone. So, in
other words, Microsoft will now have
a way to watch and record everything
that’s going on in your room. Germa-
ny and Australia, the stalwarts of sen-
sible-thinking, are debating banning
the console in their countries, due to
the ma-hu-ssive privacy concern.
Much hilarity could be had with oth-
er people’s XBones, if the announce-
ment ceremony was anything to judge
the Kinect by. Internet denizens re-
ported that their Kinect-equipped
Xbox 360s turned oﬀ whenever the
people at the event gave commands
to their on-stage XBone. Be ready for
people using in-game chat to direct
your XBone to lemonparty or goatse
(Google at your own risk). Also, using
your Xbox to watch the reveal of it’s
successor is just cruel.
DRM is back for another round,
The consolation prize? Nah, you can keep it.
Ross Webster Miss Universe 1908
where now Microsoft has you bent
over a barrel, and you’re still begging
for more. No backwards compatibil-
ity with previous games, and games
are tied to your Xbox Live account
(like WiiU games, but we’re bash-
ing Microsoft today). Microsoft has
mentioned creating a monopoly on
the used-game market, where you can
give up your license of ‘Game A’, to get
a discount on ‘Game B’ – the sequel to
Game A, with nothing changed apart
from a new weapon, which we’ll nerf
on release’. So yeah, good luck with
that Microsoft. We’ll be watching.
And silently judging.
there is nearly always something you
can do in the meantime to maximise
your chances of a successful stealth kill.
Overall, Mark of the Ninja is a testa-
ment to what a group of programmers
can do when they have a singular vi-
sion and the time and money to do the
best they can at fulﬁlling that vision.
Mark of the Ninja is available on
Steam or Xbox live for £12, and a sin-
gle DLC will be released over the
summer, expanding a little on
the backstory and intro-
ducing new items.
XBone is watching
you sleep. It enjoys it.
The sequel, Simon of the
Ninja, coming Fall 2013
