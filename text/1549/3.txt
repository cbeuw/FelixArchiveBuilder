Evening Standard
Isa’s name translates to “Jesus” in English;
Jesus is an important prophet for Muslims,
one who strived for the betterment of man-
kind. Isa tried to emulate the qualities of the
prophet by devoting his youth, health, rich-
ness, time and, ultimately, life, for the sake of
God through humanitarianism. This beauti-
ful example is particularly relevant in light
of the tragedy that occurred in Woolwich
earlier this month, showing how religion can
be and is a motivation towards beneficence.
Isa left Britain to use his medical skills to save
lives, and both his death and the death of
Drummer Lee Rigby have brought sadness
to a great many people. The Quranic verse
related by Deputy PM Nick Clegg last week
at a conference with Muslim leaders thus
feels particularly relevant: “If anyone kills a
human being, it shall be as though he killed
all mankind. Whereas if anyone saves a life,
it shall be as though he saved the whole of
mankind.” My thoughts and prayers are
with the families of both, and it is my hope
we will see unity through their loss.
Doctors in Syria work in extreme
conditions with a shortage of re-
sources and the daily danger of being
attacked. He died after a shell hit the
hospital that he was working with,
which was a secret clinic in the Idlib
province. His body was buried last
week in Atmeh. Two other civilians
also died and two were wounded. he
attack has been blamed on govern-
ment forces by HIHS.
Last Friday, over 200 people gath-
ered in Kilburn with Isa’s family for
a condolences session. here were
Imperial students from ﬁve diﬀerent
year groups who attended to pay their
respects, as well as teachers from his
school and consultants from his hos-
pitals.
Faddy Sahloul, Chairman of Hand
in Hand Syria (HIHS) described Dr
Isa as “a shy young man whom I ﬁrst
met two years ago.” He went on to say:
“Everyone who knew him is shocked
and saddened to hear the tragic news
of his death, but we can draw com-
fort from the fact that he died doing
work that he loved. Our thoughts and
prayers are with his wife and family at
this difficult time.”
HIHS said: “he brave young doc-
tor sacriﬁced his life to save the lives
of others and he will be very sorely
missed by the many family, friends
and colleagues who knew him.” HIHS
is a non–political organisation that
was established at the start of the Syr-
ian uprising in 2011. Over the last two
years, over 80,000 innocent lives have
been lost in the Syrian crisis. HIHS
aims to provide medical and humani-
tarian help to civilians who have been
impacted by the conﬂict in Syria.
hey have set up secret facilities in
locations where it is too dangerous
for casualties to use the government
hospitals or where the hospitals have
been shut down.
Isa was a dear friend to many stu-
dents at Imperial, and was heavily in-
volved with the Islamic Society (ISoc)
during his time at university. His oth-
er philanthropic endeavours include
heading the Imperial Charity Week
team in 2008, a project that enabled
Imperial students to raise £22,839.25
for orphans and needy children
around the world. In addition, Isa ac-
tively organised tutorials and PotMed
events for the Muslim Medics society,
as well as oﬀering advice and guid-
ance to younger students. He was also
a member of the Snooker and Book
clubs at Imperial.
Isa was described as a dedicated vol-
unteer who strived for good and pro-
foundly touched the hearts of many
people with his endeavours, and as a
true inspiration to everyone – many
will deeply miss him. On behalf of
the ISoc at Imperial, the President,
Hazem El-Turk, commented: “Isa was
undoubtedly one of the most excep-
tional individuals to pass through
our Society. His contribution to uni-
versity life, as well as his passion and
commitment to issues beyond that
are things that we remember him for
today. Our thoughts are with his fam-
ily in this difficult time, and we hope
that his selﬂess actions will inspire
others to engage more in humanitar-
ian issues worldwide”. Muslim Medics
and the ISoc will be having a tribute
to Isa later on in the year.
Aamir Shamsi, a 5th year medic
at Imperial said that Isa was “a great
man and an elder brother to me.”
Aamir went on to say: “Isa’s patience
and wisdom was beyond doubt even
at such a young age. He had a tower-
ing presence and was highly respect-
ed in the community but he was so
modest and humble that you would
never have realised his incredible
achievements until someone told you.
He was and will continue to remain a
great role model.”
His friends set up a JustGiving page
for people to donate money for a new
ﬁeld hospital to be set up in his mem-
ory to continue his work. he original
plan was for a new ambulance in his
memory. However, the £7000 needed
was raised in fewer than 14 hours. His
friends said that the speed with which
the money was raised was “a testa-
ment to the character of Isa and the
beauty of the people who know him”.
he aim was changed to the more
ambitious target of setting up a ﬁeld
hospital, which would be named af-
ter Isa. In the last week, over £50,000
has been raised, which means a ﬁeld
hospital in Syria can be set up after
Isa and will be run by HIHS in his
memory.
On the Just Giving page, his friends
paid tribute to him. hey said: “hose
who knew him personally, and those
who have heard of him, will know
what an amazing, inspirational, kind
and deeply-caring person he was. It
is quite hard to know where to even
begin describing what an amazing
person he was, and all of us are still
in shock.”
he donations, which came in thick
and fast, came with comments paying
tribute to him. Anne Hinojosa said:
“I am so sorry to hear of the death of
this brave young man. What a beauti-
ful, inspirational human being.” Not
all of the donations were from fellow

be from people that did not
know him personally and/
or are not Muslim. Anthony
Page said: “A brave man…
Respect… from an atheist.”
At the time of going to print
there have been over 900
donations.
Dr Mahmoud al Akraa, a
close friend of Dr Isa, com-
mented that “once you met
Isa you never forgot him. He
was so kind, so warm and so
brave. He had the respect of
everyone and would do any-
thing to help others in need.
One time one of the refugee
camps in Syria had chol-
era and no doctor would
go in, except Isa. He would
risk his life for others. He
worked up until midnight
and would treat hundreds of
patients each day. He would
then sleep rough in a sleep-
ing bag and often not wash
for days.”
