said: “he Library on the St Mary’s
site has always been a favourite with
students despite its somewhat tired
look. Many former students will re-
member it both as a place for study
and to attend some wonderful social
events. hanks to a major refurbish-
ment funded by he St Marys Devel-
opment Trust and by Imperial Col-
lege it is now a joy to behold and is
ﬁt for the 21st Century. It certainly
invites study and there is provision
both on the ground ﬂoor and in the
transformed gallery with modern fa-
cilities, superb lighting and comfort-
able furniture. here is an elegant
staircase which allows easy access to
the gallery. I hope it will be used and
enjoyed by many present and future
students and I also hope that alumni
will make a point of coming to see
the transformation which has sensi-
tively retained all the oak and other
features while becoming thoroughly
modern. Deborah Shorley who was
the Librarian in Imperial deserves a
special mention for her foresight and
her perseverance.”
Staﬀ, students, doctors, medical
professionals and the funders cel-
ebrated the reopening of the Fleming
Library earlier this month.
he refurbishment appears to be a
greatly needed boost to the library,
which was last redone in 1982. he
upgrades include a redecoration, new
staircases, improved heating, lighting,
Wiﬁ, more computers, a study space
and a training room.

>> Cooper who designed many other
buildings including the NatWest
building on 1 Princes Street – was
originally opened in 1933. he build-
ing was used for student activities
up until 1982. It also played host to
Gilbert & Sullivan productions over
Christmas, one of which was attended
by Her Majesty he Queen and Prin-
cess Margaret in 1945.
So, next year’s stressful all nighters
will be in a more modern setting.

Before (left) and after (right) the refurbishment, it’s like changing rooms
under less pressure than the others.
he Graduate Students’ Union
(GSU, formerly GSA) will be electing
their committee for next year. Last
year, many of these positions had to be
re-run as nobody put themselves for-
ward for the positions. his seems to
be also happening this year, as multi-
ple positions are uncontested. 8 out of
the 14 positions available will have to
be re-run as nobody is going for them.
here is also the problem with one
person going for two positions that
cannot be simultaneously held.
There was a problem with the web-
site for the elections. This year, the
candidates submitted manifestos for the
website by writing them in a text box
on the website. They could therefore
write a draft in this box, save their pro-
gress, and adjust the manifesto until the
deadline. When the deadline had past,
the manifesto would be locked from ed-
iting and the last version would be up
on the voting website. During this elec-
tion, there was an error, and students
and, more importantly candidates, were
able to see the manifestos that other
candidates had submitted (pictured).
This means that candidates could have
changed their manifestos based on oth-
ers that were submitted. The problem
was swiftly rectified after the Union
were informed of the issue.
This year, the position of RAG Chair
will not be in the Summer Elections.
This was instead elected at the RAG
AGM. Fewer than 50 people attended
this and the new RAG Chair will be
Callum Kirk, who was this year’s RAG
Secretary.
The manifestos for the candidates and
voting will be online at https://www.un-
