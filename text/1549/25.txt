Researchers from University College
London, along with the Bee Research
Group at the University of Illinois
have published a paper in Nature,
which details the decline of the honey
bee within the British Isles.
hrough the use of tagging, the
Freedom of Information Act, and
enlisting the help of InterPollen, the
203-page paper reports that an in-
creasing number of bees are spending
their time at secondary, or even ter-
tiary hives, in the Cayman Islands.
he majority of bees monitored,
spent their time moving between their
hives and members-only gardens, and
are often quoted as ‘working’ when
questioned.
Over the last 4 years, much of the
bee populace of the UK has been sub-
ject to a political shift, with many of
the constituent apiaries moving to-
wards a conservative standing. Due
to the stresses of political life, MBs
are able to claim back honey that is
spent maintaining their two hives –
one in their constituency, and another
in London. hey are not allowed to
claim against their allowances, honey
spent on any properties which they do
not live in.
However, rumours spread on the
internet last year, over alleged em-
buzzlement of honey, after photos
were released of Sir Edward Fuzzing-
ton-Stripes, meeting with a group of
wasps. Upon confrontation, Sir Fuzz-
ington-Stripes, aged 2 months, and 12
days, gave up a list of names of other
involved parties.
his lead to the arrest of many MBs,
also on the charge of wax evasion,
which holds a maximum prison sen-
tence of 18 days.
his isn’t the ﬁrst time that Sir Fuzz-
ington-Stipes has been caught in the
spotlight either. Last May, a super-
injuction was taken out to prevent the
proliferation of photos of him, crawl-
ing out intoxicated, from the ﬂower
bed of a Miss Givens of Bethnal Green,
London. It didn’t help his image, when
later, upon leaving Downing Street, he
was heard to mutter ‘fucking drones’
as he was ushered through a side gate.
In the light of this research, the gov-
ernment has suggest that we should
lower the wax tax for the bees with
the most honey, to stop them from
leaving the country. he paper, how-
ever, does go on to say that trying to
bribe bees to stay in this country, just
to keep the honey ﬂowing, is god-
damn stupid.
Hangman’s 2013 guide to getting some nerdy companionship
Dappy: “Tarzan”
“Estate agent told me I can’t be
late,
When I turned up told her chat to
my briefcase”
So were you late or not? You
haven’t actually said. You could
have been on time and then told
a woman to talk to an inanimate
object. What’s really strange is car-
rying around a briefcase that is,
presumably, full of money. That’s
fucking stupid and unnecessary.
Just pay with a bank transfer.
When your eyes first meet:
1. Check in a mirror to make sure
your fedora is on straight.
2. Approach the female.
3. Choose an icebreaker that will dis-
tinguish you from the grunting apes
that she normally dates. Go for some-
thing that shows oﬀ your mature side.
“Kirk or Picard?”
4. When she turns away, and con-
tinues to talk to her friends, she’s just
playing hard to get. Don’t worry, white
knights – persevere.
5. Compliment her, so she knows
how you feel about her.
“You smell like my mother.”
6. She should now be enamoured,
but too shy to be seen with someone as
handsome as you, so you need to make
the ﬁrst move.
7. Ladies love to be surprised, so
when she’s not looking, twist her head
towards you, and shout about how
great you are.
8. She might start groping you there
and then – if not, just inform her that
you do engineering so could poten-
tially ﬁx any appliance that ever breaks
(even though you deﬁnitely couldn’t).
9. By now, you have either been
thrown out of the bar (the urinals are
not “fancy toilets” as you claimed be-
fore squatting), arrested (the sink basin
isn’t a “tall urinal”) or, more likely, are
nursing a pint in the corner pretending
to send a text message. In either case,
repeat steps 1-8, until success. If eve-
ryone rejects you, retreat to a kebab
shop and then home – your lecture
notes can keep you warm at night.
10. If she doesn’t want your number
then give the guy doing those weird
rhymes in the toilet your digits. hen
you can tell your friends you gave
someone your number, as long as you
don’t go into speciﬁcs you technically
aren’t lying.
Your first few dates:
1. Chose something unique, such as
going to the movies to watch a horror
movie. Girls love all that blood and
screaming.
2. Bring her back to your parent’s
basement, and watch all of Firefly,
whilst holding back the tears. hen
move onto a Lord of the Rings mara-
thon. his way, she sees that you have
some emotion.
3. Go out for a meal somewhere.
he ladies love european cuisine, so a
classy establishment like Pizza Hut is a
great choice. Ignore the 14 year olds on
dates. hat doesn’t mean this isn’t so-
phisticated, they’re just mature.
4. Fall deeply in love, and ask her to
marry you.
5. She if she subscribes to the YOLO
philosophy by asking how awesome
from 1-10 your 15 YOLO tattoos are.
Honey honey honey....... honeeeyyy
