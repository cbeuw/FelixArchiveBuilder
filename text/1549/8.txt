hen I found out
that my team
had made it to
the ﬁnals of the
Engineers With-
out Borders (EWB) Challenge I was
of course really pleased to know that
all of our eﬀort was actually worth it. I
feel really satisﬁed because I think that
if they chose us out of the 50 teams in
the UK and Ireland, this means the de-
sign portfolio and oral presentation we
produced were valuable and we actual-
ly managed to apply our (engineering)
skills to a real problem successfully.
I think there were mainly two good
things about the Horizons course I
took and the EWB Challenge in gen-
eral: ﬁrst, you get your hands on a real
engineering problem and with the help
of the data provided by EWB you have
to come up with a solution that makes
sense and takes into account all the
variables of the real world; second, you
get to think about the problems the
world has from the perspective of the
less fortunate, of the world’s poorest,
who don’t even have safe houses or ac-
cess to clean water, so you widen your
point of view quite a lot and realise you
can actually do something to change
the situation.
his year, the challenge was to de-
sign an engineering solution for one
of the many problems aﬀecting a com-
munity in rural district of Vietnam, in
the Mekong Delta. My team decided to
focus on the “Housing and Infrastruc-
ture” design area: our objective was to
improve the design of the houses and
buildings this rural district so that they
could provide a safe sheler for the fam-
ilies against the threat of rising sea wa-
ter levels, pests and extreme weather
events. During the eight weeks of the
course, we learnt how to assess our
strengths and weaknesses (in terms
of knowledge, skills, interests), how to
better deﬁne the question and how to
choose the best solution among a few
that we had come up with. he fact
that we are now in the ﬁnals shows
that we probably managed to do this
pretty well!
he course was very well designed
(especially if you consider it was the
ﬁrst time it had been run), and I think
Elizabeth [the member of staﬀ at Im-
perial Horizons] did a very good job
in matching the assessment criteria
for the Horizons course to those for
the national competition. his course
was actually special, in that it was both
organised by Imperial (and so the ﬁnal
mark we got will go on our transcript,
I think) and by EWB. We didn’t have
to do more work when submitting the
design portfolio and the oral presen-
tation to the competition because, as
I said, the “marking scheme” was the
same.
I would recommend this course to
next year’s ﬁrst year students, as it
gives you an insight into what they
call the global dimension: it helps put-
ting your course and the things you
study in the right perspective, thinking
about what the real problems that the
world faces today are and what we can
do about it. I also very much liked the
fact that the cultural and social side
of the issue was highly stressed: we
learnt that for a design solution to be
accepted, it must be consistent with
the cultural and social characteristics
of the community you are implement-
ing it in. When you are dealing with
communities whose culture is very dif-
ferent from the Western, this require-
ment becomes especially stringent. I
guess this is the reason why the whole
programme is called “Horizons Global
Challenges”: it forces us to widen our
perspective to include multiple points
of view, because only in this way we
can understand each other even if we
are from diﬀerent parts of the globe
and work together to solve those
problems that can be solved only by a
communal eﬀort (see Climate Change,
Global Poverty).
So yeah, the ﬁnals are now a very
good opportunity for us to ﬁnd out
how other teams from the UK have
approached the issue and maybe learn
something new about how we could
improve the way we have approached
it. It will also be a good opportunity for
us to conﬁrm that coming from a good
engineering university means that we
can actually be quite good at solving
engineering problems (in fact, we have
three teams in the ﬁnals...)
