IMPERIAL HORIZONS 2013/14
Union Council has discussed giving ex-
tra remits and remaing the Sabbatical
positions in the Union (except for Fe-
lix Editor and Medics President). Over
the last ten years, the Union roles and
remits for the President and four dep-
uty Presidents have been kept relatively
constant.
he paper was brought to Union
CouncilbythecurrentSabbaticalTeam.
It explains that during the last ten years,
the Union has developed to be a diﬀer-
ent organisation to what it used to be:
it is a registered charity that employs
45 members of full time staﬀ and has a
turnover of £5.5 million. External fac-
tors have also changed signiﬁcantly, for
example the change in tuition fees
he current Sabbaticals are proposing
changes to the exact role descriptions
for the role of the Sabbatical; they also
believe this is something that should be
reviewed every 4 or 5 years according to
the needs of current students.
A comparison of the Union with
other student Unions was undertaken.
Comparisons were made with institu-
tions that are a similar size to Imperial,
as well as those who scored well in the
NSS survey question where students
are require to rank their students’ un-
ion.
he paper states that the Sabbaticals
believe the Union does not do enough
to: support postgraduate students,
support volunteering, support inter-
national students, support students
based on campuses other than South
Kensington, enable internationalisation
amongst the student, eﬀect liberation
of minorities, develop student’s career
opportunities and campaign for fairer
living costs in London. he last of these
they say was under the spotlight “par-
ticularly this year, with #AgainstActon
and the North Acton development”
.
he paper also says that the Sabbati-
cals are keen to add in careers, student
development, an aspect of post gradu-
ate support and volunteering to the
current role of the Deputy President
(Finance & Services, DPFS).
his proposal has two discussion
points. he ﬁrst is adding in the remits
state above into the Sabbatical roles.
he second is renaming the role of the
DPFS to Deputy President (Community
& Development), where the remit of the
DPFS will remain but with the afore-
mentioned additions. he reason given
is that “this would more aptly describe
what the DPFS role does on a day-to-
day basis”
he paper is clear to mention that the
Sabbaticals are “not proposing remov-
ing any remits from any of the roles. We
are happy (and believe) that sabbaticals
in this organisation should always retain
certain powers and ability to do things,
even if they’re not what they (going for-
ward) are required to do day to day.”
At the moment, it is merely a discus-
sion and not an action.
