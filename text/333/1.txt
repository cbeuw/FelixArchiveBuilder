And for the second
RENT
time of asking
An Extraordinary General Meeting of Im-
perial College Union has been called for Tues-
day at 1 p.m. in the Great Hall. A petition con-
taining the required 130 signatures was col-
lected last week.
The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the
motion below. Basically this calls for a rent
strike for next term to "fight against loan
financing of new halls" and "as part of the
National Grants Campaign." The motion was
put to the Grants Action Committee at its
meeting last Friday, and was approved —
albeit by a vote of four for four against. The
votes against were led by John Lane, I C U
President, who wanted clauses 1 to 4 inclusive
deleted. Apparently all the members present
at the meeting were in favour of a rent strike.
A motion calling for a rent strike was put to
the first union meeting of this term, and de-
feated. The left-wing factions were dissatisfied
then because the remainder of the grants
motion was passed overwhelmingly, and "we
were left with all the policy but none of the
action."
Now lacking publicity, and with rapidly de-
clining interest in the Grants Campaign, the
motion stands its chance of getting through
only in a meeting like this Extraordinary one
where there is likely to be a good Soc. Soc.
turnout and few others.
The Motion
CATERING/RESIDENCE
Proposed by Trev Philips
ICU affirms the G A C d e c i s i o n to make one
of the two central d e m a n d s of the refec-
tory boycotts, Total opposition to the "self
financing policies in refecs. No price in-
creases no cuts in portions — no clo-
sure of any refecs.—no redundancies or
short time for staff.
f C U adds' to this that " W e must make the
state p a y " and " R e f e c boycotts a n d other
tactics w i l l be maintained if necessary as
part of the fight against self financing and
price increases, etc. even if grants are in-
creased."
ICU instructs the refec, committee reps,
to ask the college for assurances that there
w i l l be " n o price increases . . . etc. (as
a b o v e ) " .
If the assurances are not forthcoming ICU
to w i t h d r a w all representatives from the
refec committee until a U G M d e c i d e d
otherwise. ' '
A s a further part of the c a m p a i g n from
decent living standards ICU reaffirms the
policy that " t h e D E S must pay for all
future h a l l s " and so I C U :
i. asks college authorities to itemise
separately the 3 5 p voluntary levy on
hall b i l l s ;
ii. w i l l give full support to any student
exercising his discretion over payment
of levy.
T h i s union recognises the urgency of the ac-
c o m m o d a t i o n situation in and around South
Kensington, the need as s u c h for more
halls of residence and to fight against loan
financing instead of s u b s i d i e s for all fu-
ture h a l l s of residence. This union there-
fore advocates a rent strike starting from
the beginning of next term in o r d e r : —
1. to fight against loan financing of new
halls;
ii. as part of the national grants c a m -
paign.
Day of
Boredom
Wednesday's National Day of Action
brought with it even greater apathy and lack
of participation than was apparent at last
year's Autonomy Day of Action. Lecture boy-
cotts were not unsuccessful — attendances
varied between near zero to nearly 90 per cent.
But most of those that ried a story straight out
boycotted lectures, predic-
tably, stayed at home in
bed. Attendance at the al-
ternative syllabus took un-
til half-past ten to reach
the fifty mark, despite hav-
ing such speakers as M i c h -
ael Duanne, th ex-head of
Risinghill comprehensive
school, who caused such a
of the N U S Press Service
headlined "500,000 on
strike." It seems unlikely
that the strike will have
any effect on anyone, l§ast
of all the D E S , who are
still refusing to do any-
thing about student grants
from next year other than
the £20 increase in under-
rumpus with his novel graduate grants that has
ideas of education in the
early 1960's.
The other main speaker
was M a r y Richardson,
from the N U S Executive.
Discussion was held on

years now. M r . N o r m a n St

tary of. State at the De-
partment of Education
and Science, however, has
such topics as the White intimated that he is will-
Paper. Most of those at- ing to look into the ques-
tending were from the pol-
itically active sections of
the I C U n i o n Community.
Other parts of the coun-
try saw little better res-
ponse, although most
national newspapers car-
tion of married women's
grants. A t present mar-
ried women receive only
£275 per annum against
the normal grants of £480.
