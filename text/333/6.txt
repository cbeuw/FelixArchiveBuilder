FEEIX HNAKCIAEEY
Summing up
by Derek E. Gummings
This week sees the last article in the FELIX FINAN-
CIALLY series which has been appearing in FELIX
for almost a year. The purpose of it all, above all
else, was to make an attempt to discuss some of
the practical financial problems that we are all
likely to run into at some time during our lives —
and to discuss them in non-technical, down-to-earth
style. And in this, we have been able to call on
the expertise of our columnist and lecturer in social
studies, Derek E. Cummings (a man of whom it has
often been said . . . but never proved!)
We think one of the best things to be said about
FELIX FINANCIALLY and its impact is to record the
fact that its disappearance from these pages has
been received as good news in certain quarters.
For our approach to the subject has been, to say the
least, at variance with that of some of the more
entrenched interests in the business. Cummings'
commonsense advice has often been provocative
and always to the point.
So, who better to sum up what FELIX FINANCIALLY
has tried to say?
I suppose it is inevitably true that for a large
number of y o u at Imperial College, the e n d of this
series of FELIX F I N A N C I A L L Y w i l l provoke a mas-
sive roar of indifference.
I'm that m u c h a realist, y o u see. I fully under-
stand that not everyone finds the subject of finance
the most riveting topic in a w o r l d where there are
s o m a n y other things to worry about. A n d I also
understand that when you're scratching about trying
to stretch a meagre student grant until the end of
term, such remote things as mortgages a n d house
purchase have limited application.
On the other hand, I don't think I have been
wasting my time. Apart from the fact that I have
been able to help a considerable number of students
w i t h direct a d v i c e — a n d that there are those a m o n g
you w h o n o w o w n their o w n property as a result
of such advice — I believe many of the things I
have been trying to say are of such blindingly
obvious truth that they w i l l , in fact, c o m e to m i n d
w h e n y o u yourselves are faced w i t h the problem
of ordering your lives in the great outside w o r l d .
W h a t I have been attempting is to clear away
some of the illusions a n d falsehoods w h i c h litter
the path of anyone w h o gets entangled in the
necessities of modern living . . . I mean such mun-
dane things as buying insurance, getting a house,
providing for a family a n d so forth. A n d , let's face
it, most of y o u are going to be involved in such
things, however remotely distant they may seem
at this moment.
M o n e y is going to be even more important to
you then than it is now. A n d what I have been say-
ing on these pages for the past year is that y o u
have to be careful a n d think before y o u spend it.
A b o v e a l l , be sure y o u need to spend it before y o u
start lashing it about.
Take insurance, for example. It's one of those
subjects w h i c h really makes m y hackles rise. I hate
to see people being c o n n e d into buying insurance
and believe me, never have so many people been
so heavily conned by so few.
If y o u haven't already been approached by an
insurance salesman, you most certainly will before
long. T h e y ' l l urge y o u to buy the stuff for a multi-
tude of reasons — for protection, as an investment,
as a safeguard against a rainy day, as a kind of
magic formula for doubling your money.
M o s t of it is just so m u c h toffee. It's a pound to
a pinch of manure that y o u don't need it — for
any reason. N o t yet, anyway.
The time to buy insurance is the day you need
it a n d not a day before. Y o u ' l l need it w h e n y o u
start a family w h o m you want to provide for in the
event of your death, or perhaps w h e n y o u buy a
home and want to secure that.
But if one of those policy-waving hustlers comes
along a n d tells you h o w you can invest in insur-
ance for a few pounds a year a n d h o w the insur-
ance company w i l l double your money in twenty
years — forget it. However good it looks, it's a
lousy investment. After a l l , inflation is doing m u c h
better at halving the value of your money faster
than any insurance company c a n double it.
There really is only one certain way of making
sure your money increases in value, and that's to
put it in the land. And I don't mean dig a hole and
bury it, I mean invest in property — buy a house.
It is a big responsibility to take o n , I know. B u t
the value of property is always going upward a n d
w i l l always continue to do so since land prices
inevitably follow the basic responses of supply a n d
d e m a n d . A s M a r k T w a i n said: " B u y land — they
ain't m a k i n g a n y m o r e ! "
Now, if y o u take those arguments to heart, I feel
I'll have achieved something. Just don't let your-
self b e chipped a n d s w i n d l e d into putting your
money into something that gives y o u a lousy re-
turn — even if it is dressed up in the clothes of
one of our b i g institutions. For w h e n it comes to
money, the advice the actress gave to the bishop
still holds good — namely, for heaven's sake, be
careful I
W h i c h brings m e to the other side of the argu-
ment. H a v i n g the money, it makes sense to part
with it only after proper consideration. B u t where
do y o u get the elusive stuff? Y o u want a bank loan
or a mortgage? H o w do y o u go about it?
W e l l , the answer is to shop around for them.
They are there, b u t it's up to y o u to find them a n d
get the best deal y o u c a n .
S o m e of y o u may remember that during a couple
of m y social studies lectures, I brought along a
bank manager a n d a mortgage c o m p a n y manager.
They h a d a lot in c o m m o n . Both were g o o d blokes,
both understood something of the problems stud-
ents a n d graduates face, both h a d control of large
amounts of money — a n d both were of a n e w type
of money m a n . Both are prepared to back their
hunches. If they hear a good argument as to w h y
they ought to part with their money — even from
a student — r they are more often than not w i l l i n g
to put their money where it's needed.
There aren't too many about like them. Institu-
tions, banks, mortgage houses a n d insurance firms
are still riddled with m e n w h o play it a l l strictly by
the rule-book, w h o won't take a chance.
If you have one of them as a bank manager —
the kind of man who writes you a letter when you're
three pence overdrawn—you're in the wrong bank.
Get out, and shop around. Even if you've only a
couple of quid to put into your account, go and sort
yourself out a manager who makes understanding
noises.
Of course, it's true that banks are starting to fall
over themselves to get student accounts. Y o u c a n
hardly see into a bank w i n d o w these days for b i g
posters telling you h o w w e l c o m e you are a n d h o w
cheap it is to bank with this or that bank. B u t
banks are run by their managers. Remember, it's the
man you're after, not the name on your cheque
book. T h e same is true of mortgage companies.
Their managers have a g o o d deal of autonomy, too.
It's well worth losing a little shoe-leather to find
one w h o is prepared to listen.
A n d , above a l l , remember that nothing is impos-
sible. The mere thought of buying a house a n d
burdening yourself w i t h several tons of bricks a n d
mortar a n d the need to go on m a k i n g the repay-
ments may w e l l seem beyond y o u . But it's not
necessarily true.
A s I said earlier, there are a number of students
at imperial College n o w , w h o have done it a n d w h o
have thereby given themselves a head start in
the scramble to achieve financial security. They
listened to advice a n d , I know, they think it well
worthwhile.
W h i c h brings us to the other point. It is nearly
always worth your time a n d effort to seek a n d find
good advice about your financial problems.
Unfortunately, this again involves you in ferret-
ting about for it. After a l l , there are a lot of sharks
in the financial sea a n d a m a n in striped pants
and a bowler hat can strip y o u of your money just
as quickly as a man in a mask holding a shotgun.
There are bandits of all kinds waiting for the u n -
wary.
The b i g institutions thrive on them. They make
their money out of public ignorance. A n d oy the
public, I mean y o u some time in the future: a n d
by ignorance, I mean not knowing what is bast.
safest a n d cheapest for y o u a n d your future depend-
ents.
I have a distinct loathing for people a n d organisa-
tions — great or s m a l l — w h o trade on this lack
of knowledge. T i m e a n d again, in these c o l u m n s
and. in public, I have castigated insurance c o m -
panies Who sell the p u b l i c policies they don't need,
bank managers w h o treat their customers like mor-
ons a n d the others in m y o w n profession w h o grow
fat by playing along w i t h the s y s t e m .
I hope that one day successive generations w i l l
change the system, a n d I believe they w i l l .
But w h i l e it persists a n d y o u have to operate
within its limits, then be sure that y o u make it work
to your advantage.
A n d the only w a y y o u c a n beat any system is to
k n o w h o w it w o r k s a n d h o w to avoid its most
dangerous pitfalls.
I hope I've h e l p e d .
The World
needs you!
Start this year—volunteer for V.S.O.
Why Volunteer?
Developing countries constantly ask for m e n a n d
w o m e n trained in a w i d e variety of professional
skills, to help their o w n nationals.
In addition, volunteering provides c o m m u n i c a t i o n
to take place between those in this country a n d
their colleagues in the host country. Thus the
volunteering, whilst making a significant contribu-
tion to a country's development gains in personal
experience of a n e w culture.
Who is needed?
University graduates (like yourselves) in engi-
neering a n d science subjects.
What sort of work?
V . S . O . s objective is to supply stortages in man-
power of developing countries. F e w volunteers are
engaged on relief work; most work on projects
where their knowledge a n d skill c a n be passed on to
others. For this reason most volunteers are involved
in some form of instruction either in classrooms,
technical institutions, or informally.
In all cases volunteers are involved in responsible
work w h i c h needs doing cannot be supplied from
local resources, it tests their ability a n d character,
and in return gives them a vivid insight into another
country a n d its problems.
Where is the work?
In developing countries of the w o r l d , in particular
throughout A f r i c a , in the Indian sub continent, S . E .
A s i a a n d the Caribbean.
V . S . O . ' s primary concern is to ensure that a
volunteer is p o s t e d to a job where his qualifications
and skills have full scope, but also tries to c o m p l y
with any soundly based preference expressed by
the volunteer.
Is there supervision of work?
Volunteers survive on their o w n merits, but a d -
vice by the British C o u n c i l a n d the volunteers' per-
sonal V . S . O . contact is at their disposal if required.
For how long?
A n offer of two years is encouraged, although
a m i n i m u m of one year is acceptable.
When?
M o s t volunteers fly out in August/September,
though a number go overseas in January.
What are the terms of service?
V . S . O . provides equipment a n d household allow-
ances — transport to a n d from project — mid-term
grant of £60 for 2 n d year volunteers — medical
and accident insurance — a resettlement grant of
between £ 1 0 0 - £ 1 7 5 according to length of ser-
vice.
Host country provides free a c c o m m o d a t i o n —
monthly salary at local rate for your qualification or
full board plus £3 per week allowance — free
medical care.
Is there any training?
Selected volunteers attend two courses during
J u l y / A u g u s t , one concerned with country of post-
ing, a n d the other on professional skills.
Lastly V.S.O.'s aims
1. To help developing nations solve their econo-
mic, technical a n d educational problems.
2. To build friendships between Britain a n d de-
veloping countries through w o r k i n g together.
3. T o provide the opportunity of w i d e n i n g s y m -
pathies a n d understanding through service overseas.
