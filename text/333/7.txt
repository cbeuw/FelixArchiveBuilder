I.C. wins
Football
Cup-Final
DOUBLE FOR I.C.
I.C. made it a hat-trick of cup wins on Saturday, 10th
M a r c h , by beating Birkbeck 2-0 at Motspur Park. This
was the last match of a long series which has seen I.C.
unbeaten since mid-November, and taken them to the
league and c u p double—not bad for a side that lost
its first four games.
Arriving promptly at the ground (well it was a cup-
final) the lsts were met with the bad news that the 3 rd
team had lost the upper reserves c u p 2-0 to Birkbeck
2nd. T h e 3rd had ben unlucky to concede a deflec-
ted goal at a time when they were i n complete com-
mand and they never really recovered from this.
The first few minutes of the U . L . Challenge cup
final were typical cup football with a l l the players run-
ning hard and the ball oscillating from end to end with
great frequency. Neither side was at ease on an unusual-
ly bumpy Motspur pitch but Birkbeck seemed to settle
down quicker than I.C. and their midfield were too
often allowed room to pick the ball up on the halfway
line and r u n at the I.C. defence. Several of these runs
had I.C. i n trouble. I find it hard to recall w h y none
of these early attacks produced shots on the I.C. goal.
A s I.C. settled down the game became more even and
Birkbeck were given a taste of things to come when
Maurice Hastings drove a 20 yard shot just over the
bar.
Shortly after this a throw i n on the right, produced
a muddle in the Birkbeck defence and gave Steve Bates
a chance to put I.C. ahead—a chance which he took
with great certainty.
A s so often before I.C. began to improve once they
were ahead. 1'he defence became much more stable
and Birkbeck did not seem to know how to take advan-
tage of the large Motspur pitch. T h e I.C. defence has
never been slow and Birkbecks long through were just
not accurate enough to tell. T h e I.C. midfield was look-
ing good, but only going forward. When called upon to
help defence they seemed lost i n the middle of the pitch
A s a consequence of this Birkbeck managed to get
several long range shots at the I.C. goal. Only one
of three was o n target and Cerwyn Edwards d i d well
to push this round the post.
A t half-time a neutral observer would probably have
said I.C. were lucky to be leading and he'd have been
right. Birkbeck had played the better football (or more
of it) and were only a goal down because the I.C. de-
fence h a d kept them out and because the quality of
Imperial players i n front of goal is such that they don't
need to be asked twice to score. It was clear though
that I.C. would have to get the ball to their forwards
much more often i n the second half than they had i n
the first.
Birkbeck put a l l they had into the first twenty min-
utes after the interval and the I.C. defence found the
going hard. This time however, the midfield put their
minds to helping the defence. T h e tackling of Pete
Lonnen and especially Steve Bates coupled with the as-
tute passing of John Kelly soon threw Birkbeck back.
But I.C. could still not find their forwards with any
great accuracy a n d the 1-0 lead looked very fragile
when Birkbeck broke from defence.
O n the touch line Steve Wells began to warm u p
and he would surely have come on had I.C. not scored
a second. A corner was half cleared and fan Bell
pushed a first-time ball through to Byron Smith whose
high cross fell, a little fortunately, into the far corner
of the goal. T h e goal itself was lucky but the initial
pass was a fine example of a football brain at work and
the difference between Birkbeck's keeper and ours was
well shown by his poor positioning.
W i t h the result no longer in doubt the last few min-
utes lacked the atmosphere of the previous eighty.
This was I.C.'s third cup win in a row and shows just
how wrong people can be when they try to predict the
fortunes of a team at the start of the season. T h e
league trophy will also grace I.C.'s trophy cupboard
this year after absence of four seasons.

BADMINTON
W i t h the season almost over and the courts tending
to cut up rather easily, the 3rd team voted to take a
well deserved respite from the tensions of the league
title race and conceded a critical match by arranging
a fixture with Kings but not telling them about it.
Talks of a team holiday i n Majorca originated at
about this time but it was estimated that funds would
just about pay for the refreshment before the journey
so this idea was discontinued. Instead, the I l l r d s were
left to face the intense challenge of no match for a
fortnight. Meanwhile the IVths had shot to the top of
their league b y winning a l l their matches by default
and the 1st team squad (pronounced: morons) h a d
been depleted by introducing a M r . George w h o into
their midst so soon after his strapadictomy operation.
The seconds, too had not been idle—using their time
to consolidate their lead as 2nd i n division one due
to a series of accidents when they won several matches.
W i t h Chris Atkinson i n such fine form this season not
to mention the others i n the 2nd team because they'll
take up too much space it's only the splendid work of
Chris Forkdodger i n the lsts that is keeping them i n
1st place above the 2nds (that's worth a pint isn't it,
Chris?).
Beside's the U L U matches, I C Ists beat Cambridge
Cockerals each year and this year was no exception,
but apart from this the members of the badminton
club are quite nice really—especially R h o d (Ooh, what
a give-away!!).
O n Thursday last, the badminton club annihilated
the boat club at darts by P games to q where P is great-
er than q but they forgot to buy our drinks and didn't
want a boat race in the U n i o n Bar. A real boat race on
the Thames was discussed though.
The final team placings for the end of the season
seem almost certainly to be:—lsts captained by Dave
W a r d ; 1st i n division 1. 2nds not captained by Chris
Atkinson; 3rd in division 1, 3rds not captained; 2nd i n
division 2. 4ths captained by Maurice Flanagan; 2nd
in division 3. 1st mixed team, both 1st i n divisions 1
and 2 respectively. 2nd mixed team, both 1st i n divi-
sions 1 and 2 respectively.
F o r the 2nd consecutive year I.C. lsts are through
to the final of the U L U Badminton c u p and are, in
fact, favourites to win.
Also, the Ists have w o n their league for the fourth
consecutive year losing only one match—in 1971. T h e
mixed team, however, have slumped alarmingly re-
cently and crashed to their first defeat i n 2 years when
they lost 7-2 to U L — t h i s however does not affect the
league placings.

BLUEBEARD
'Bluebeard' ( X ) Continentale, Tottenham Court R d .
Richard Burton, Raquel Welch et. a l .
The other day I had the unfortunate experience of
seeing this film at a press showing, i n the company of
our Daily Newspaper critics. It is hardly surprising that
so many damning film reviews are churned out nowa-
days—the audiences at press shows are so bored. It is
most embarrassing to be creased up with laughter at
a funny bit only to look round at Ian Christie ('Ex-
press') and friends looking on in stony silence.
But I d i d enjoy this film—a nice M o n d a y morning
escapist film.'It is about a German count nicknamed
Bluebeard because his beard is that colour due to a
flying accident in World W a r One. H i s speciality is
accumulating one gorgeous lady after another, then
doing away with them in various interesting ways. H e
shoots one, guillotines another, drowns yet another i n
red wine, etc.—the list is almost endless. Since he is a
hunting m a n he also has to keep his trophies i n his
family deep-freeze deep i n his Schloss. Eventually his
latest wife discovers them, so he puts her i n as well
(alive), but not before he tells all about his previous
loves. Hence the film.
The plot isn't up to much—nor the acting; except
for a few character parts (Raquel Welch as a nun, for
example). But we are supposed not to notice a l l that
circumstantial rubbish, bombarded as we are by one
lovely lady after another i n varying degrees of undress.
I must admit I was overcome (so was Ian Christie!);
even so, it is meant to be a comedy (not that I c a n
expect anyone to take it seriously) and there are some
witty bits—like one over-affectionate wife who insists
on making h i m choose between her breasts " C i n n a m o n "
and " J a s m i n " , half suffocating h i m in the process. B u t
in the end we discover just w h y Bluebeard does kill a l l
these nice wenches, and I must stress that this reason
is a problem that affects all men alive today.
Y o u r s seriously,
S E R G E I .
ALL FINGS FOUL
AND FUNDERFUL
A l l Things Bright and Beautiful ( A A ) . A B C U n i o n
Concert H a l l , Last Tues., Wed., Thurs.
Just what was the Felix film critic doing at an I.C.
play, y o u may ask, when about 3,500 people didn't
bother? H e went there because he knew a few people in
it, who were very insistent about selling h i m a ticket or
two (perhaps if I had been the Theatre Critic, I might
have got in free).
Well, the play was a Northern comedy, full of north-
ern humour (he said in his best home counties accent)
which was not lost on the very receptive audience, who
presumably were a l l friends of the cast, persuaded to
come along and see M i k e or Denny, and pay 25p for
the pleasure. Still, the cast, conditioned to audiences
of 50 or so, by Thursday were naturally apprehensive,
until they realised how nice the audience was, when
they warmed up. T h e play is as much about Rory, the
son, (who is never seen—only heard) as about any-
one. Central in the plot is a stolen lectern i n the form
of a large eagle, which is an allegory 1 suppose of ' A l l
things Bright and Beautiful', the things the Hesseltine
family has never had. They live in a slum and are soon
to be rehoused, which supposedly will solve a l l prob-
lems, especially for 'Queenie' (Mrs. Hesseltine), who like
the rest is 'Waiting for Godot'. (That was the only
theatre-critic cliche 1 can remember.) However, every-
thing seems to go wrong. They are allocated a flat
miles out of town not a house close by as they expected,
and this, with the broken, half painted eagle supposedly
represents their dead-ended existence. Very sad. Very,
very sad.
I.C. acting contrives to amaze me. A s usual some
people are better than others, but none very bad. I liked
Penny Pike's stand-offishness, M i k e Stranger's bearded
dogmatic dominant Hesseltine senior, and Carina as
Queenie or was it Queenie as Carina?—she was very
realistic, perhaps too realistic. Steve Groves did a nice
cameo role at the end and seemed to enjoy it. In fact
I think all the cast enjoyed themselves—enough said. If
the cast enjoyed it and so did the audience, who a m I
to criticise the artistic content (which was not lacking)?
