"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life"
(2 Corinthians, 3:6)
Sir,
Surely Karl Marx would
be turning in his grave if he
had seen the word "logic"
smuggled into the letter
from Mr. Veall, who profes-
ses to be a follower of Marx
(or is it Trotsky or Lenin,
Stalin, Mao, etc?). Logic is
something we scientists are
weaned on, presumably to
use, so let us use it.
I have never in previous
letters to "Felix" used
"arguments . . . in support
of the existence of this per-
son called Christ" any more
than we use "arguments
in support of the existence
of a- of a person called"
Julius Caesar or Henry VIII.
Historical fact is not argu-
ment: I have q u ot e d
Josephus, the Bible and
Tacitus, can we logically ig-
nore the documents? Really,
it requires far more faith
then to be an agnostic than
it does to be a Christian! I
feel, therefore, it is absurd
to call these facts "sheer
nonsense" and then to insult
the intellect of readers of
this newspaper by not giving
a coherent reason why they
"amounted to sheer non-
sense".
Once again it seems neces-
sary to clarify the meaning
of the word "Christian".
Christ came to give us life:
"I came that they might
have life in all its fullness"
John 10 : 10.
He died because Man's
basic problem is not only
distribution of wealth, God
is not so myopic as was
Marx, he knows our prob-
lems are far deeper, the
Bible calls this problem SIN.
Very briefly, sin is man's
wish for complete self-
sufficiency, that is, a rebel-
lion against God and our re-
lationship with Him. Man is
capable of this SIN because
God made us "in his own
likeness" (Gen. 1 v 26).
God's will is free and so is
ours. Normally we choose
ourselves instead of God and
we cause a separation.
"All have sinned and fall
short of the glory of God"
Romans 3 : 2.3-
In dying Jesus restored
our relationship with God,
provided we accept his
death for our sins. Further-
more in accepting Christ, He
comes into our lives as
Saviour and Lord and gives
us new life. Now I hope you
will have noticed I have not
once mentioned Church. This
is simply because a Church-
goer is not necessarily a
Christian, and Christianity is
not the Church that Mr. Veall
has nightmares about (re-
membering Sunday school at
the age of 10), but Christian-
ity is a personal knowledge
of Jesus Christ, the Son of
God. So it is quite possible
that large organisations we
know as religious often not
adhering to their foundations
(i.e. for Christianity personal
knowledge of Christ and the
Bible, God's Word) have
made great moral mistakes.
These mistakes are mistakes
occurring due to man's wish
to take things into his own
hands en masse and are
analagous to such moral
mistakes as we find in Red
China where schoolchildren
are indoctrinated to h a t e
certain races or classes, or
as we find in Russia where
although a front of religious
freedom is portrayed, the
Christians I talk about, who
confess Jesus as Lord are
persecuted. Even Kosygin
sees the difference. Perhaps
"Religion" in that sense "is
the opiate of the people",
but "Jesus Christ is the
light for all people: And the
light still shines in the dark-
ness" John 1 : 5.
So Christ presented us
with facts, with his sacrifice
for our sins, a new life, and
life with him forever. It is a
free gift from God, from a
God who loves us. So what
about all the other things
Mr. Veall mentioned which
he thought suggested that
God doesn't love us? He
suggests starvation, massive
wars, atom bombs, etc. As
the Bible explains man's
problem is sin and these are
the r e s u l t of sin. So I appeal
to all reading this letter, real-
ise God does not ask you to
believe contradictions, but
truths, Jesus said: "I am the
way, t h e t r u t h , and the life"
(John 14 : 6). God has made
it far easier to believe his
logic than man's paradoxes.
I pray that many more
hard hearts in this College
will become followers and
friends of Jesus Christ and
find their true identity.
"God is faithful, by whom
we were called into the fel-
lowship of His Son Jesus
Christ, Our Lord" (1 Cor. 2
ix).
I remain,

could persuade Ali (don't
mind if I call you Ali, do
you?) to have a Theological
Page next year; it would

P.P.S. — / promise never
to write a letter as long as
this again to Felix this Aca-
demic Year.—M.M.
Sir, -
In answer to Mr. Jock
VealTs letter, I think that he
is being not a little silly. He
states that the "arguments"
presented the previous week
were "sheer nonsense". This
is interesting because I did
not read any arguments, just
facts, and it is necessary to
distinguish between argu-
ments and facts (it is note-
worthy, however, that in
George Orwell's book of the
future, "1984", the regime
of the time changed histori-
cal facts to suit their own
ends). He "stands logic on
its head" by doing this. If
he were to try and find out
the facts and then reject
them if he can, this would
be logical, but just to reject
something out of hand just
because it goes against his
own doctrines is foolishness,
especially when Christ has
so much to offer.
In saying that the previous
week's correspondents had
called Christ a revolutionary
indicates to me that he had
not read either letter proper-
ly. It was an earlier corres-
pondent who had called Him
this. However, Christ is a
revolutionary in the true
meaning of the word, be-
cause he revolutionises in-
dividual lives. Mr. Veall
appears to be very narrow
in his definition of revolu-
tionary, only taking the
political meaning. A true
revolutionary is someone
who causes a complete re-
versal, which is what Christ
does to individual lives when
people invite Christ into their
lives, first by admitting that
they feel a need for Him
(everyone does at some time
in their lives), then confes-
sing that they have been
sinning against God (every-
one does—Romans 3:23),
and then asking Christ to
come into their life and take
full control of it and become
Saviour and Lord of their
life.
In most of the rest of the
letter, he writes about re-
ligion, N O T Christianity. This
is a very common fallacy. It
should be noted that Christ-
ianity is not a religion.
In answer to Mr. Veall's
question "mystical or mater-
ial (prayer or struggle)?", I
have found in the last year
that prayer is a far more
powerful means for instigat-
ing action than belligerent
struggle which only comes
up against a brick wall. How
he can talk about prayer, I
do not know. He obviously
knows nothing about its
meaning. It is a very complex
subject and even very old
Christians do not totally un-
derstand prayer. As Paul
says in Romans, chapter
eight,, verse 26: "For we
don't even know what we
should pray for, nor how to
pray as we should, but the
Holy Spirit prays for us with
such feeling that it cannot
be expressed in words".
Anyone wishing to find out
the real facts need only to
turn to the Bible. If you still
have any problem, ask a
Christian (easily found at the
Christian Union bookstall on
Tuesdays and Thursdays in
the JCR, or in the maths
library, first floor, 53, Princes
Gate on Fridays at 6.30).
Yours in Christ,

Sir,
The only criticism I have
so far received of my letter
published in 'Felix' a fort-
night ago, was that, whereas
I submitted that physical ex-
planations for the miracles
Christ was reported to have
performed were weird, the
critic felt that to say God did
them was far more weird.
His opinion stems, I
believe, from our general
reluctance to consider any-
thing outside our physical
realm coupled with our
enormous capacity to ignore
things which are not SEEN to
affect us at the moment. I
would like, in very basic and
simple terms, to explain why
I feel this 'narrow-minded,
materialistic' attitude to be
fundamentally in error.
If you were to look up
from this letter you would
see something. Perhaps some
people, or a wall . . . a grass
field, or maybe, just air and
clouds should you happen to
be up in a balloon. No mat-
ter what you are looking at
it will be made of atoms, so
our scientist friends tell us,
and from these atoms, which
in turn are made up of
smaller particles of matter,
our 'physical' universe is
constructed. We are also in-
formed that, although the
matter may be rearranged or
changed in form, it is incap-
able of reproduction, crea-
tion and destruction. You will
by now have guessed what
comes next. Yes, that's it,
the fact that matter does ex-
ist and yet cannot have
created itself implies the
existence of something else.
No, not a Christian God, we
have not got that far yet, but
we can now make two infer-
ences about this 'Thing'. It
is non-physical; it defies at
least the physical law of 'no
self creation'. Also it created
the physical universe.
We have up to now pro-
gressed using simple facts
and deductions which are
available to and, I hope,
understandable by all who
read this letter, and I shall
endeavour to extend this
method to a second line of
thought.
Consider now the last time
you REALISED someone was
in need of your help. Maybe,
you saw someone staggering
along carrying more than
they could manage, or it
could have been a friend
asking for help at an in-
opportune moment. Whatever
it was the following basic
feelings will have been pre-
sent. You will have wanted
to help, either because of a
'natural herd instinct' or be-
cause of selfish motives (e.g.
the friend might do some-
thing in return). Conflicting
with this will have been any
of a whole host of 'negative
emotions'. For instance, you
will have realised that you
will be inconvenienced, that
you would be spending time
on something unbeneficial to
you, and in the case, say, of
rescuing someone in a burn-
ing building, that you would
be putting yourself in dan-
ger. Thirdly your 'conscience'
(I use this word because it
will conjure up to the reader
roughly the sort of thing I
mean, but I reserve the right
to modify my meaning of
'conscience' without refer-
ence to the normal diction-
ary definition) will generally
tell you to help.
Now the 'herd instinct'
when it comes to unselfish
help is rather weak. One
might say that the drive be-
hind 'preservation of species'
is small compared with that
behind 'preservation of self.
So one would then expect
help to be rarely forthcoming
without selfish motives. Yet
help does come quite often.
'Conscience'? More often
though we ignore our 'con-
science' and do not do what
it tells us. But it does not
give up. It keeps on nagging
every time we reject its
guidance.
A little expounding is
now necessary. 'Conscience'
does not appear to be justi-
fied on solely physical
grounds. What, for example,
is the physical reason for
unselfishness? Also a 'con-
science' appears to be a
common possession of all
men. Furthermore, stop and
think about what the world
would be like if we were all
ruled by our 'consciences'. I
feel it would be a better
place, but whatever you
think, it would be GUIDED
CONSTANTLY towards one
final state. Notice that no
matter how incomplete the
method of deduction above
may be or what we believe
'conscience' to be it does not
affect the base and the end.
The fact that we have 'con-
sciences' and that they are
non-physical. In both my
points, of creation and of
'conscience', I am using
only facts which are just as
evident and available to the
reader as they are to me.
Surely now our suspicions
must be aroused. We have,
from earlier, an un-physical
'Thing' creating a physical
universe. We have an un-
physical force trying to run
a physical universe; demon-
strating that the physical has
not just been created and
forgotten. Although, we
have this situation which
may be insufficient in itself
to warrant action, it should
definitely awaken us in our
attitude to the non-physical.
Let us now call up Christ-
ianity to see what it has to
say on these points. We read
in John 1:1-5 (R.S.V.):—
..."In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was
God. He was in the begin-
ning with God; all things
were made through him,
and without him was not
anything made that was
made. In him was life, and
the life was the light of men.
The light shines in the dark-
ness, and the darkness has
not overcome it".
Here we have the creator,
God. We have the power
behind the world, God's
Word, not only manifested
in the world and ourselves,
but also written in The
Bible. And we have the
Word's constancy both of
purpose and of perseverance.
See also Genesis 1:1, 1 John
1:1; Rev. 19:13; John 17:5;
Col. 1:16; 1 Cor. 8:6; Heb.
1:2, John 5:26, 9:5, 11:25.
12:46, 14:6.
Then in Romans 3:23
(R.S.V.):—
"Since all have sinned
and fall short of the glory of
God".
Here we have our dis-
obedience to God's Word.
The realisation of these two
points is fundamental to be-
coming a Christian. 1: God
made us and 'loves' us. 2:
We reject his 'love' and go
our own way and so are sin-
ners.
If we are still to call
Christianity untrue, weird, or
a crutch for the needy, then
consider atheism. For that
we need to reject facts we
know and experience daily.
We need eventually td reject
our very existence, so do not
associate atheism with logic.
Yours in Christ,
ROBERT SLOTA.
