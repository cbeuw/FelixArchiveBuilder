The Westminster Theatre is unique
— f o r its productions for the M o r a l
Re-Armament M o v e m e n t (yes, folks,
M R A ) are firmly ideologically dedicat-
ed. M y o w n personal attitude
towards M R A is not unlike my atti-
tude towards the Sussex County
Cricket C l u b — deep respect and
hearty approval of its a i m s , while
limitations of time and energy pre-
clude the fullest d i s c i p l e s h i p .
Thus the new Revue " G B " cannot,
indeed must not, be judged on the
normal, purely theatrical, grounds—-
for it never pretends to owe anything
but pace to the modern, p o s t - " B e -
yond The F r i n g e " , satire. The sket-
ches are, often, extremely funny, and
the rather standard points are made
with a freshness that, in some places,
compares well w i t h anything that the
Frost-Cooke-Rushton heritage pro-
d u c e d . But even when a sketch falls
short of this (and it w o u l d be very
misleading of me to pretend that
many do not) there is always some-
thing there—the supremely positive
attitude behind the w h o l e enterprise.
S o m e of the songs seemed rather as
if they had been rejects from " T h e
Desert S o n g " — b u t the good ones
were very g o o d — ( " C r i c k e t , Trans-
port or National Health,/you can a l -
ways rely on the C o m m o n w e a l t h "
sings an i m m i g r a n t ) , — a n d they alt
make a point of some kind.
So where, asks the show, s h o u l d
" G B " go? There is no clear-cut
answer, and the s h o w never pretends
that there is. A l l the modern vices
get the pasting they rightly d e s e r v e —
the greed of the Capitalist ("It takes
the waiting out of w a n t i n g " explains
an armed bank-robber), the hypocrisy
of the " F r e e d o m F i g h t e r " ( " T h o u
has provoked me into provoking
t h e e " ) , the C o m m e r c i a l Christ
( " J e s u s Christ, Superstore") a n d in-
flation ("It's not that we want m u c h , /
W e just want m o r e " ) . But anybody
who goes expecting a cut-and-dried
answer to National Destiny w i l l be
disappointed.
I have deliberately avoided men-
tioning the cast by name, for I saw
an early preview in w h i c h they had
not yet fully settled into their mater-
ial, and any c o m m e n t I might make
w o u l d be obsolete by the time this
appears in print. But two perform-
ances, even now, deserve mention on
any basis. M i c h e l Orphelin, the
French m i m e , does his " T h e Fisher-
m a n " m i m e w i t h a marvellous G a l l i c
f l a i r , — a s well as one or two other
neat cameos; and M i k e Fields dances
very well throughout. H i s " B e h i n d
the Barrel of a G u n " s o n g , — s u n g ,
gun in hand, darting furtively between
patches of shadow, was the most
striking piece of the show, and re-
called the ominous violence of " W e s t
S i d e S t o r y " .
S o , whither " G B " ? If I knew, I
w o u l d n ' t be writing reviews for
'Felix', — but for anyone who cares,
this s h o w c o u l d be very important.

I.C. C a t h o l i c Society: Outing to Chichester.
C O N C E R T S AT I.C.
Not having been to a concert for
three weeks I was beginning to feel
that something w a s lacking in my
life, so Saturday night I sat expec-
tantly waiting for C a n to appear.
Instead I w a s greeted by the attempts
of s o m e peace freak in the audience.
I w a s quite relieved that for most
of the set he restrained himself to
leaping about.
C a n ' s m u s i c is very difficult to de-
scribe. Not in any derogatory sense,
I can only call it a pulsating drone,
w o r k i n g round a very loose basic
structure. One thing I can be sure
about is that it's definitely m o o d
music, and in general there w a s a
very intense c o m m u n i c a t i o n between
the band and ' ^ a audience.
Each of their numbers w e r e very
long (about half an hour), containing
several highs, and, not bearing a great
deal of resemblance to their a l b u m
tracks, nor being introduced, I w o u l d
be a brave m a n to try and list all the
titles, though perhaps " A l l e l u j a h " was
recognisable.
One thing that I found surprising
w a s the sheer length of their set.
Very few bands nowadays are pre-
pared to play for over two hours, so
Can deserve full credit for giving
value for money.
G.J.K.
I've been telling m y friends for quite some time now that H o m e are a
fine band, and I'm not normally one to jump on the bandwagon just because
John Peel, Bob Harris and all the m u s i c papers say so as w e l l . Perhaps
if any of them were at the concert on Saturday they w o u l d now believe me.
One thing is for sure is that lead singer M i c k Stubbs d o e s a better job
now than w h e n he w a s a m i l k m a n . He had to pay £20 when he gave up
to put his books straight.
In opening their performance H o m e have joined a still small list of groups
w h o do more than begin by just w a l k i n g on stage. Instead they played a
passage from (I believe) Stravinsky's " R i t e s of S p r i n g " , strode on stage
at the tumult of the crescendo and leapt straight into " D r e a m e r " , a fine tight
number, w i t h Laurie W i s e f i e l d ' s guitar playing sounding remarkably like that
of Afbert Lee.
The rest of their set was rather similar, mostly fast numbers, occasionally
w i t h a short spot in the m i d d l e for Wisefield to demonstrate his expertise.
The only smudge to their name I thought was w h e n they asked if anyone
liked rock ' n ' roll, and delved into " R o l l Over B e e t h o v e n " . Surely they
have enough g o o d material of their o w n without this needless inclusion,
w h i c h is usually left to the amateur groups.
However they redeemed themselves after this and finished with two
numbers rolled into o n e — " W e s t e r n F r o n t " with Wisefield changing o
side guitar, and Stubbs to piano, followed by my favourite track " L a d y of
the B i r d s " , the vocals well developed, as throughout, for their kind of
m u s i c .
Previously, Bees M a k e Honey played for about twenty minutes before
being joined by Frankie M i l l e r , and w a r m e d the audience quite w e l l .

A BOOK
Basic Christianity by John R. W .
Stoti.
Published by Inter-Varsity Press.
T h i s is a book w i t h , in one sense,
nothing new and in another sense
everything new. It tells of facts
known 1,940 years a g o yet ones
w h i c h are consistently m i s c o n s t r u e d
generation after generation. It is a
book designed to be an introduction
to a person, that person being J e s u s
Christ. Stott recognises on the first
page the d e f e r e n c e between the " e s -
ablishment c h u r c h " a n d Christianity.
The chapters are categorised under
four main headings: Christ's Person,
M a n ' s N e e d , C h r i s t ' s Work, M a n ' s
Response. Anyone daring to read this
book cannot fail to realise that the
life and death of J e s u s is far more
than the best recorded fact in history,
and that the Resurrection must not
be approached from the viewpoint
that it is impossible, unless you are,
as M r . Sherlock H o l m e s w a s , pre-
pared to accept the impossible.
This book is very challenging, a n d
only a very brave or foolish man
w o u l d d i s m i s s it without a thought.
It is a " m u s t " for people w h o w i s h
to d i s c u s s Christian T h e o l o g y a n d
Jesus Christ, but w h o are ignorant
of the facts.
