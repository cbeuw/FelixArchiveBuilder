Yes, Saturday was the date of the motorcycle section
" B u r n to Brighton". T h e accompanying picture shows
the gang waiting to start off i n Exhibition Road.
Notice the keen looks of anticipation, the alert minds
waiting for the task ahead, the challenge of the open
road, the:— oops, got carried away again.
Brighton was exactly where we expected it to be,
which is just as well as we couldn't have gone any
further without aqualungs. Everyone made it there
and back without incident although one bike was only
put together at midnight the day before.
After the success of this ' B u r n ' we are going to
attempt a long-distance " B u r n to the Broads" (no
apologies) on the weekend llth-13th M a y .
See you then,
Bruce Cross.

I C retained the inter-collegiate hockey cup on Wed-
nesday at Motspur Park with goals—one in each half—
from M a r k Tatchell and Steve Tucker. I C had to make
one change from the side that beat Barts i n the semi-
final when Jaz Missan was required to play for Spencer
in the London League on the same afternoon. However,
his replacement, A l a n Brown, played very well consider-
ing that he was prevented from playing his natural
attacking game.
Playing up the slight slope i n the first half Guys
immediately took control of the match and virtually
camped i n the I C half for the first fifteen minutes. I n
fact, they had a great chance to score in the first few
minutes after a neat piece of dribbling o n the right but
Sid Boulton did well to cut out the final pass.
I C mainly relied on quick breakaways during this
period and even managed to find the net after a great
run by John Schofield—who managed to find acres of
space—but it was disallowed when three players crashed
into the net with the ball. After this play became more
even and from another breakaway o n the left I C opened
the scoring. M a r k Tatchell received the ball on the
wing, cut inside and slammed it into the net after
rounding the goalkeeper.
In the second half Guys continued to do most of the
attacking but fine defensive work, by Simon Tyrrell and
Steve Tucker in particular, usually broke up the danger
on the edge of the circle.
IC's second goal came from a short corner midway
through the second half after a deliberate foul stopped
Dick Whittington i n the twenty-five. This was magnifi-
cently struck by Steve Tucker and went in via a Guy's
stick.
Guys pressed strongly until the final whistle but they
failed to capitalise on the few chances that were created.
In fact during the match they had seven short corners
whereas I C only h a d the one—but shots were only
made from two of them.
The whole I C side played well, the only black mark
being against I k i Kullar for losing his temper midway
through the first half.
Team: Sid Boulton; Simon Tyrrell, Dave Browne;
Dave Richman, A l a n Brown, Steve Tucker; D i c k Whit-
tington, I k i Kullar, J a g Gahir, John Schofield, M a r k
Tatchell.

Waking up o n a Sunday morning with two hours
sleep and thick fog is not the best way to gain enthu-
siasm for a day's excursion to Brentford Market. Never-
theless, by 10 o'clock three courses were laid out,
the fog was lifting, and the cool morning air was
thick with the tension of our seventeen arriving com-
petitors. S i x of these were Cemian (so where are y o u
all, y o u sciving, cringing, lazy Guildsmen). T o make
these events more successful we need y o u a l l , and
anyway, it's great fun.
So with scrutineering, expertly handled by Charles
Lamont, and with far more than the usual cries of
'Its too tight'??? The tests proceeded, after, of course,
a demonstration run by Boanerges himself.
Tests 1, 2 and 3 happened before lunch, with plenty
of action, dramatic wheelers to the fore, and thank-
fully few crumpled bollards. Complaints of minis los-
ing o i l pressure on, after all, a test that .was designed
with that i n mind, were graciously rejected and the
only reverse spin I saw, was guaranteed to be unin-
tentional. Even by lunch, the competition was hot.
The top three places being closely contended by 'Our'
Tony Raine and 'Their' D o n A r i s and A l a n Winter.
W i t h three lady entrants, things were getting quite
heated in these quarters too, not to mention the saloons
class.
The afternoon saw the remaining six tests a l l of
which appeared to r u n smoothly, and the boy racer
brigade were having a whale of a time on the further
regions of the market. D i d anyone not drive anyone
else's car?
The results speak for themselves, and to be fair
to everyone, I will not comment on individual perform-
ances, but congratulations to Tony for taking the over-
all awards and A l a n Winter and Nigel Price (Cemian)
for the class awards not forgetting D a w n H i c k m a n
for being top lady although, to be fair,
she has had infinitely more experience than our two
local lasses, who both showed striking sportswoman-
ship.
So it leaves me to thank a l l the entrants, marshals
and spectators with special thanks to M i k e Drury
for sharing the organisation and extra special thanks
to M r . Raine for donating the trophy which spends its
first year in the capable hands of his son Tony.
John Baird.

We regret to announce the sad demise of the 1C
mixed hockey team's two-year-old unbeaten record. It
passed quietly away last Sunday afternoon at Shenley in
the presence of Northern Polytechnic. Despite an early
attempt at artificial respiration by A l a n Brown, two
late hammer blows finally put the last nail in the coffin.
The last rites were administered by Reverend G r a h a m
Popple. The wake the same evening was attended—and
enjoyed—by: Chris, Bob, Julie, Blossom, A l a n , Anne,
Jenny, W B 2 , Villis, W B 1 , L i n d a .

The final of the U L U Upper Division Reserve C u p
was held at Motspur Park on Saturday, 10th M a r c h ,
kick off 11 a.m. I C were represented this year by
the I l l r d team as the IPs had been knocked out i n
an earlier round. T h e Illrds had reached the final by
beating I C V ' s i n the semi final (plug for the V ' s ) .
The opposition was supplied by Birkbeck IPs who had
beaten Bedford I P s i n their semi final.
A small faithful band of supporters who had man-
aged to kick their mistresses out of bed early enough
to catch the coach leaving at 10 "a.m. turned u p to
watch the match.
Both teams started nervously, particularly in defence.
I C had the best of the opening exchanges with Geoff
Gilbert on the right wing providing the most trouble
for the opposition. The Birkbeck goalkeeper
particularly unsafe dropping ldng shots and centres
tantalisingly near the on rushing I C forwards. After
about 30 minutes of the first half Birkbeck went ahead.
A long through ball down the middle caught the I C
defence in some confusion, the Birkbeck centre forward
chased the ball and his shot hit R o b Y o u n g o n his
back and unfortunately the ball went straight to a
Birkbeck forward who made no mistake i n putting
the ball into the net. This goal h a d a b a d effect o n
IC, they seemed to lose concentration and were lucky
to go into half time only one goal behind.
They hadn't regained their concentration when a
few seconds after the restart the Birkbeck forwards
forced a corner on the right. T h e corner was taken
and the Birkbeck centre half w h o h a d come into
the penalty area unmarked had a fine header, he
headed the ball into IC's six yard b o x where a
Birkbeck forward had another free header o n to the
bar, the ball rebounded to same forward for yet another
free header this time into the net.
The Illrds might well have been expected to fall
apart after this further setback but led by their cap-
tain Ian Hyslop they fought back. They managed to
win more balls in midfield. They produced some fer-
ocious tackling—one particular "tackle" by Ian Hyslop
earned him a fierce lecture from the referee. I C brought
on their substitute B o b D a y for John Giles i n the
hope of getting more penetration u p front. They also
moved up A n d y Jackson to play him centre forward,
midfield and centre half at the same time.
The Illrds fought back superbly, but were unable
to find a way through the Birkbeck defence that had
to resort to a lot of pushing, shirt pulling and some-
times knee high tackles to stop them. They were un-
able to score and the final score was 2—0 to Birkbeck
IPs. It was not a brilliant game of football with both
teams struggling to string more than two passes to-
gether. Birkbeck deserved to w i n but I C were a bit
unlucky not to score a goal.
The cup was presented to winning Birkbeck captain
by Peter Mee, Registrar of the College and President
of I C Football Club.
The small band of supporters made their way down
the road to the public bar of the E a r l Beatty, to
prepare themselves for the afternoons game when I C
1st were due to extract revenge on Birkbeck 1st i n
their final ( I C w o n 2—0). T h e losing l l l r d made its
way to the pub to celebrate reaching the final.
(P.S. It's rumoured that a certain young lady is
banned from playing cards with the football club after
a somewhat flukey w i n at Stop the Bus when playing
against vastly more experienced players).
