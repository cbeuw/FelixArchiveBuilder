'The Fool says in his heart,
"There is no God"
They are corrupt, they do
abominable deeds,
there is none that does good'
(Psalm 14)
Sir, ,
I would like to point out
several pieces of misinform-
ation in Mr. Veall's letter,
published last week.
For the existence of a
historical figure called Jesus
there is sufficient evidence;
there are few historians to-
day who would seriously
dispute that fact. On that
point there is little need to
elaborate. Even Mr. Veall
seems to accept it, despite
his statement to the contrary,
as he went to great lengths
to assert that this figure
(who never existed in his
opinion) advocated a philoso-
phy of apathy to the plight
of oppressed people.
First of all, we should ask
ourselves what was the
standpoint of Christ concern-
ing the oppression of the
masses. The message that
Christ brought was one of
love for others — a love
which was radically different
from anything before it or
since (including the Greek
tradition of Eros as formu-
lated by Plato) in that it ad-
vocated selfless love for all
other i n d i v i d u a i l s . The true
message of Christianity has
always contained an ideology
based on sharing, and it
goes beyond socialism and
the trade union movement
(although it is not opposed
to them) in that it upholds
and preserves a belief in the
dignity and worth of the in-
dividual. An apathetic lack of
caring for the suffering of
others is diametrically op-
posed to Christian ideology
and the teachings of Christ.
I would agree with Mr. Veall
that often the institution of
the church has failed in act-
ive interpretation and repre-
sentation of Christ's teach-
ings but that in no way
undermines their validity. If
'God Soc' are guilty of apa-
thy that is a failing of 'God
Soc' and not of the Christian
ideal. As much as anyone I
wish to see a liberation of
the under-privileged people.
The Christian message, if
properly interpreted, asks us
to get off our pampered
back-sides and do something
about it. It would be that
much easier if the motivation
for helping arose from a
genuine belief in the sanctity
of man and his individual
worth. Christianity is not
concerned solely with the
'after-life'; its concern is
here and now as well.
Secondly Mr. Veall's ac-
cusation of egoism might
fairly be levelled against the
mystical Eastern religions
but it is a fundamental error
to attack the Judeo-Christian
tradition on this point. In
Eastern mysticism the desire
is for the self to be absorbed
in the Universal Being. As
far as Christian theology is
concerned, once you have
accepted God's existence,
then one's personal acts are
directed by His will, w h a t e v e r
it m a y b e . The true Chris-
tian is theocentric rather
than egocentric, and 'you'
becomes more important
than 'I'; he acts as ha does,
not through any fear of
divine punishment {if you
don't do as I tell you to, I'll
take the goodies away) but
because of his love for God
and his desire to do His will,
and his love for people as
good, God-created rational
beings; and he does this
whatever the consequences
now or hereafter. Mr. Veall
also implies that God is
created by man, not vice-
versa, and that the facts are
analysed in terms of how
they fit the self. He ignores
specific explicit divine reve-
lation as described in both
Old and New Testaments,
quite apart from natural rev-
elation available to us all
whatever our beliefs.
Finally he makes the age-
old objection to the existence
of an all-powerful being- -the
objection being the existence
of suffering. We are not pup-
pets on strings to be made
to dance at the whim of the
Creator, because He did not
make us so. We are rational
creatures with free-will, dis-
tinct from one another and
from God, capable of loving
and creating beauty; capable
also of hating and hurting
others. It is theologically and
politically dangerous to sug-
gest, as some Evangelical
preachers do, that the solu-
tion to the world's problems
is dependent on the conver-
sion of the world to Christi-
anity. We have got ourselves
into a mess and we are
capable of getting ourselves
out. From a Christian stand
point it is easier to get things
sorted out, but it is not im-
possible to solve a natural
problem by natural means.
Revolution is not an end in
itself, it can only be judged
good or bad by the end it is
aimed at, and the means it
uses to get there. The ends
of Christianity contain and
go far beyond the ordeals of
social revolution, and its
means are more efficient in
that it changes people, as
well as systems and struc-
tures. Mr. Veall has made
the very common mistake of
equating and judging Christ
and the Christian philosophy
by the actions of the Church
as an institution. Perhaps if
he made a closer study of
these teachings and this phil-
osophy he would find that as
far as the social aspect is
concerned, they lead very
much in the same direction
that his 'revolution' is tak-
ing him. In addition he has
no guarantee that revolution
will succeed; there is a guar-
antee, however, that Christi-
anity will succeed.
Yours sincerely,

Sir,—In Jock Veall's let-
ter of last week's Felix, he
criticised the Church as 'al-
ways coming down on the
side of the old reactionary
social structure'. Surely Mr.
Veall was referring to the
organised Church which is
not necessarily synonymous
with Christianity.
Christianity does not mean
wearing a suit and trotting
along to church each Sun-
day, big black Bible under
arm. Christianity is a person-
al relationship vjith God
through Jesus Christ. Christ's
message was one to build a
new social structure NOT by
changing the social environ-
ment but by changing indivi-
dual lives through love. No
matter what the social en-
vironment is, man is basic-
ally greedy thus to change
individual people is the only
solution. This is Christ's rev-
olutionary message for every-
one that He can and will
change y o u r life.
I agree with Mr. Veall
that the 'great hastions of
religion' have committed
terrible deeds which they
s a i d were done in the name
of God. How could these
have been done truly in
God's name when they dir-
ectly contradicted Biblical
teaching? It is very impor-
tant not to confuse
"religion" with Christianity.
Yours sincerely,
ANNE MERRY
Sir,—To any person who
does not hold a Union Post,
and is not a member of one
of the left wing societies.,
the recent activities of the
Union can only be described
as amusing.
The lack of interest in
Union affairs is supposed to
be due to Apathy. But I want
to suggest that the real rea-
son is that the Union's de-
cisions do not represent the
views of its members.
If only just over 10% of
all students at Imperial Col-
lege are present at an EGM
when a strike motion is
passed, is it really any won-
der that the strike is ineffec-
tive? And it must also be
remembered, in the case of
the recent strike, that the
strike motion was only
passed after a lot of man-
oeuvering by the left wing
to get the vote taken at a
time when the meeting was
just quorate. Any realist
must admit that once the
meeting is quorate, then the
more people that are present,
the less likely it is that the
left wing will get their way.
To the average student,
all this manoeuvering is ir-
relevant. Whilst obviously
wanting a grant increase, he
is not prepared to boycott
lectures to get it.
In Elec. Eng. 3, for in-
stance, there was at least a
90% attendance at the 9.30
a.m. lecture. A handful of
pickets and a mere 50 people
(approximately—count taken
at 10.30 a.m. in the Great
Hall) at the teach-in hardly
suggests that the college is
enthusiastically behind its
Union. When those present
at Union meetings are so un-
representative, it is little
wonder that so lew people
thought it worth while to
even vote in the recent elec-
tions. T h e b e s t w a y t o d e f e a t

Sir,—You may or may not
know that a recent Royal
College ot Science Union
General Meeting mandated
the college authorities to
provide soft lavatory paper
in RCS for humanitarian
reasons. Now several weeks
later no action has been
taken.
We have therefore decided
to mount a campaign for the
purpose of forcing the col-
lege authorities to concede
our claim.
Should no action be forth-
coming the sanitary facilities
of RCS will be brought to a
constipated halt. A small
taste of what is to come will
be experienced by the higher
echelon of RCS tomorrow
(Wednesday).
Recently in America it has
been proved by several emi-
nent psychologists at Hard-
vard that hard loo paper can
lead to impotence and sui-
cidal tendencies amongst
those of tender disposition.
We hope that this letter
has highlighted the fact that
this is a very sore point
amongst students.
Yours TTPGD,

VOTE!
. . but in
GLC elections
Lots of people think
I C U is powerless and irre-
levant and don't vote.
Lots of people think I C U
are a waste of time and
don't vote. B u t no one i n
their right minds could
say that the Greater L o n -
don Council is any of
these things.
The G L C runs London
from traffic system to de-
velopment plans and as
you live here for at least
30 weeks of the year you
should make sure you
have a say i n how it is
run.
The A p r i l elections give
you this chance as y o u can
vote in local elections here
and at home.
Of course most of us
will be on vacation, but
you can still vote by post
and this can easily be
arranged: either contact
me at 176 Keogh H a l l
(Maths I) or if you want
to go straight to the
source contact
Give your name, ad-
dress here and vacation
address and we will see
you get your chance to get
the L o n d o n y o u want.
This applies equally to
all foreign students eligible
to vote, i.e. Common-
wealth, Irish, etc.; as stu-
dents we are more at the
mercy of local authority
decisions ort housing,
transport, etc. than most
so it is to your personal
benefit to vote, and now
a word from our sponsor.
The Conservatives i n
the last few years have
obviously failed to solve
any of the main problems
facing the city. F o r i n -
stance they have presided
over the greatest rent and
rates explosion i n British
history; the fact that their
leader Sir Desmond P l u m -
mer always manages to
have shares i n companies
developing places like
Covent Garden, Piccadilly
and Soho is just luck of
course!
The L a b o u r Party offer
no real solution, just the
usual doctrinaire minor
image, i.e., be a tenant
of the G L C rather than
Sir Desmond: some choice.
The Liberal Party is
offering a real alternative
to this with radical, ob-
viously sensible solutions,
i.e., cutting outside traffic
into London, expanding
public transport, getting
people the freeholds of
their homes, eliminating
fear of eviction and rising
rents, adjusting the basis
of rates to the companies
who make so much money
out of a London location
can pay for the privilege,
etc.
However even if y o u
think a l l the parties are
round the twist and just
want to spoil the paper,
vote! Whatever party
you vote for the important
thing is voting.
ELECTIONS
BUREAUCRACY
Nomination papers are now up for the posts of
President and Secretary of IC Union for the next
academic year, 1973-74. It will be the second time
that this election has been held; a fortnight ago,
only 540 people voted, a shortfall of 480 on the
quorum.
The papers are on the Council noticeboard in the
Union Lower Lounge; names require a proposer and
twenty seconders, and only full members of IC
Union may stand. Both posts carry a sabbatical
year. The papers come down at 5 p.m. on Friday.
The Hustings will be held at a union meeting on the
first Thursday of term, 3rd May, and polling will be
on the following Monday and Tuesday, 7th and 8th
May.
The first issue of FELIX scheduled for next term
is May 8th; however, in view of the elections, it is
quite likely that a special issue may be printed for
May 1st. FELIX will at least produce a special
broadsheet for that day. This extra issue will, as
usual, have space for candidates' manifestos and
photographs; the conditions of insertion are as de-
tailed below:—
Manifestos, which must not exceed 450 words in
length, must be sent to the Editor, c / o the union
office, no later than 1800 hrs on Wednesday, April
25th. These should be accompanied by a passport-
sized photograph, not exceeding 2in square. No
manifesto will be printed unless accompanied by
a photograph of the candidate. Manifestos exceed-
ing 450 words in length will have the 451st and
successive words deleted. " W o r d s " have the same
definition as words on telegrams. (See Post Office
Guide, p. 377). No restriction is made on the con-
tents of manifestos, other than a requirement that
the language used be in good taste and that the
manifesto cannot be construed as potentially
libellous.
