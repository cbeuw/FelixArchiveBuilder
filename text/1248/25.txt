It was a Friday afternoon when
we left South Kensington in a big
red smelly minibus, which we sin-
gularly failed to crash, and
hopped along the road using two
hands to change gears. After a
quick meal, safety brief and put-
ting on of lots of extra layers we
left Portsmouth Harbour in the
early evening, stuck the motor on
and pointed the boat for France.
About twelve hours later we
arrived in Cherbourg, a bit tired
and cold but otherwise fine, hav-
ing motored almost all the way as
there was next to no wind.
Unfortunately all the weather
forecasts we heard were implying
that this was definitely the calm
before the storm, with each fore-
cast predicting that the gale force
winds would arrive sooner rather
than later.
Since being stuck in the middle
of the channel in howling winds
and rain was not quite what we
had in mind, and nor was being
stuck in Cherbourg all week while
they went on - although maybe it
would have been nicer than lec-
tures - we decided to head home
a little earlier than we had origi-
nally planned. We left Cherbourg
some six hours after arriving, hav-
ing indulged in the necessities of
quick nap, some breakfast, show-
ers, a trip to the hypermarket for
chocolate and alcohol, and lunch.
As we left we checked the
engine and fuel like the good
responsible sailors that we all are
and in a still non-existent wind
motored back towards England
feeling rather as if things were too
boring to be true. And so they
were. Two hours later and our
engine started to make very
strange noises, so we turned it off,
never guessing that it would not
turn back on again. Half the crew
retired down below at this point,
and spent the next few hours with
their head in the engine trying
everything they could think of
while the other half stayed res-
olutely on deck in the cold - main-
ly because they couldn't get down
below as the steps had been
removed to get at the engine - and
concentrated on sailing as fast
and efficiently as possible in what
wind there was. Soon we were
storming along towards home and
the shipping lanes, with a stiffen-
ing wind, but no engine. We
decided that it would be safer to
continue on our way than to turn
back, considering the weather
forecast, and settled into two
watches to sail through the night.
Thankfully the wind held pretty
constant and ten hours after our
first sighting of the Isle of Wight
and a lot of big ships later we
found ourselves back in the
Solent. Still with no engine. We
obtained permission form the
Portsmouth Harbourmaster to
enter the harbour under sail,
something which is normally for-
bidden, and considered berthing
under sail. This is a tricky
manoeuvre which would have
been possible, but had it gone
wrong there were an awful lot of
boats around to hit and we had
no back up engine to allow us to
reverse out the way.
After a lot of decision making
we phoned the marine equiva-
lent of the AA, who sent a guy
out in a rib to help us in, and
then fixed our engine in two min-
utes since we had ran out of fuel.
Turns out the fuel gauge was
wrong...
