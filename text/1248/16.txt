If films wrote history, we'd be screwed. Forget
Attila the Hun, Ivan the Terrible and Hitler; in the
all-time definitive list of most evil entities the
world has ever known, the English would be sit-
ting pretty at Numero Uno. With the exception of
German and perhaps Russian, diabolical megalo-
maniacs always have English accents. Then
there's Braveheart, The Patriot, Titanic and
countless others. Blighty-bashing is the most
popular sport in Hollywood, and with Mel Gibson
in particular. And if you've ever talked to an
Aussie, you'll know that it's almost their national
past time.
Rabbit-Proof Fence is a tale of the subjugation
of Australia's native Aboriginals in the name of
Her Majesty. This is still a most controversial sub-
ject Down Under, and one of 'Straylia's most
shameful legacies. Up until 1970, half-caste
children could be removed from their homes and
sent for education in white environments. They
became known as the Stolen Generations, and to
this day the Australian government refuses to
They're all the same size really, it's just an optical illusion.
apologise for its treatment of them.
Although this is a tale of the plight of
Australia's indigenous inhabitants (and it raises
some pertinent questions about Australia's poli-
cies on this subject), it is more concerned with
what the Aussie film industry does best - which
is making simple yet subtle movies about the
nature of human emotion. The plot (based on a
true story) centres on the plight of three half-
caste girls, who are taken from their Aboriginal
mother in the 1930s. They are moved 1500
miles to be educated as servants, on the orders
of the Minister for Aboriginals, Mr. Neville
(Kenneth Branagh).
Refreshingly, the filmmakers have shied away
from making an anti-English movie, although it
must have been tempting to do so. Mr. Neville
comes across as a decent and honourable man,
albeit with badly misguided views about race and
equality. In a line laced with irony, he laments, 'If
only they could understand what I'm trying to
do'. These days, the boot is most firmly on the
other foot.
In a film where lines of dialogue are few and
far between, a hugely effective visual narrative
more than fills the gaps. Stunning cinematogra-
phy powerfully conveys the vastness and wild-
ness of the Australian outback, while the three
lead girls, Molly (Everlyn Sampi) especially, man-
age to convey much simply through body lan-
guage and facial expression. The acting in gener-
al is astounding considering most of the children
featured had never even seen a movie before, let
alone acted in one.
A word must be said too about the music. If
this were a Hollywood film (and thank God it
isn't) we'd have sweeping scores and sentimen-
tal interludes. The way that things like this are
managed produce an emotional movie despite
filming in an almost understated style; by letting
the story do the talking, if you'll pardon an
incredibly bad pun.
It wouldn't be excessive to say that this is one
of the best Australian films I've ever seen,
although come to think about it, that doesn't nec-
essarily mean much. One anecdote might con-
vince you though: in a near-packed cinema, no
one left until well after the credits had started
rolling. Even if you disregard everything I've said
above, you have to take that as a sign of a pow-
erful film. David

Now, just before you nylon flares-wearing
disco babes get all excited, this is not a film
about ABBA. Sorry. But on the upside, it is
about State Troopers. For those among you
who have never seen a Smokey and the
Bandit film (and why not?!), State Troopers
are a) a branch of American law-enforce-
ment, b) stupid and c) wear beige. Oh, and
they only have jurisdiction over roads. Which
is weird, but does make for a nice little sub-
plot to hang the Jackass-style shenanigans
on. It's been decided that the people of
Spurbury are only naughty enough to warrant
(geddit?) one local law-enforcement agency,
and so the boys in brown and the boys in
blue go head to head in a bid to crack (ooh,
they just keep coming...) a big drugs case.
It must be pointed out here that the actual
plot matters not - you'll all be too busy
chortling and rolling around the floor among
popcorn crumbs and mushy M&Ms to give a
toss. This film is hysterical! Written by a
group of mates going by the odd name of
"Broken Lizard", the film encompasses all
manners of sick, twisted, filthy and down-
right daft humour. The Troopers amuse them-
selves in the slow Vermont town by pulling
over stoners and freaking them out 'til para-
noia sets in, shagging women in exchange for
ignoring speeding violations, and having
maple syrup drinking competitions. Oh, and
they keep brawling with the local cops which
does not help their case much...
All in all, this makes for a very entertaining
romp, and did cause us to laugh very loudly
whilst proper journalists sneered and acted
all professional. Which I think is a high rec-
ommendation for any film. The acting isn't
great, and the simple plot may be an issue
for some, but what really sets this film apart
from others of its ilk is the group dynamic of
Broken Lizard. These are blokes who you
know are good friends - the kind of friends
who spend all their time chuckling about car-
toons and taking the piss out of each other.
They are the friends Monica, Chandler and
Co. will never be and the kind of friends
everyone wants. Amazingly, this rapport car-
ries to film beautifully - Broken Lizard wrote,
acted and directed the entire thing. And you
just know they had such a wicked time doing
it.
Go see this with your own mates, and if
you don't have any, go see it to find out what
you're missing out on. Feel-good, funny and
with a special appearance by Wonder
Woman. What more do you want?

In the most harrowing series yet, Buffy faces
some serious evil, including Dracula, a
demon god, a bratty baby sister and the
death of her mum. The teen messages the
directors love to force-feed fans are slightly
overly played, and irritating Riley is still not
dead, but the series is worth it to see the
darker turn Whedon et al are taking. Extras
are pretty standard, with director's com-
mentaries, scripts and behind the scenes
look at stunts. Liz
