Success on the Water
Bill Mason's last year as chief
coach of Imperial College Boat
Club ended with strong perform-
ances by the eight crews that
competed at Henley Royal
Regatta in July.
Four crews in total progressed
to the semi-finals on the
Saturday. In the Temple
Challenge Cup, the 1st eight
narrowly lost to their main
rivals, Oxford Brookes by half a
length. Both crews were pushed
to the limit, so much so that
Oxford Brookes were arguably
too tired to beat Harvard in the
final.
In the Grand Challenge Cup
for eights, an Imperial College
composite crew comprising row-
ers from the national squad
went out to a German national
crew in the semi-finals. In the
Visitors Challenge Cup for cox-
less fours, the Imperial College A
crew were beaten in a tight race
against a composite crew from
Oxford Brookes and Imperial
College. It was later revealed
that Imperial College's 3-man,
Tim Perkins was suffering from
gastroenteritis during the com-
petition. The composite crew
containing Dan Marret and Dave
Gillard of Imperial went on to
win the event in a controversial
final requiring a re-row when a
flock of geese wandered on to
the course.
Other crews of note included
the second Temple Cup eight
who lost a narrow race to a
strong crew from Marist College,
USA. Finally a pair from Imperial
raced the South African world
bronze medallists, worrying
them off the start going out in a
well publicised race.
Four members of the Temple
Cup eight, George Whittaker,
Hugh McKenzie, Ed Johnson
and John Weale, went on to win
silver in open coxed fours in the
National Championships. This
experienced crew raced with
tenacity over the 2000m course,
only being overpowered by the
winning crew from
Nottinghamshire County in the
last 300m.
This ended a successful regat-
ta season that saw various wins
at the Metropolitan, Docklands
and Reading regattas. Imperial
also sent an eight to an invita-
tional student regatta in
Valenciennes, France, where
they beat Dresden of Germany to
win the final. Special note
should go to the new members
of the club who won novice
coxed fours in convincing style
at Putney Town regatta.
The women's squad prevailed
through a difficult year and pro-
duced strong performances from
a small base. At Women's
Henley Regatta, Cathy Burgione,
Kelly Cummins, Ali Elsey Helen
Ellison, and cox Seb Pearce
competed in the College coxed
fours event. They raced with
determination and skill against
the much bigger, but younger,
crew of Eden High School,
Canada, but were unable to pre-
vent them slowly edging out a 1
length lead by the finish line.
Comfort was to be drawn from
the fact that it was the closest
any crew got to Eden in the
event.
Imperial College was also well
represented at the various inter-
national regattas during the
summer months.
At the World Championships
in Seville, Steve Trapmore, Luka
Grubor and Kieran West from
Imperial College, together with
Tom Stallard of Cambridge
University and cox Christian
Cormack of Leander competed
in the men's coxed fours. They
dominated the event, rowing to
gold in the final in commanding
fashion. This adds to their
impressive Olympic gold they
achieved in the British men's
eight in Sydney 2000. Imperial's
Dan Ouseley also rowed in the
British men's eight this year in
Seville to come 6th place over-
all, a most respectable result
considering their initially poor
performances at the preceding
World Cup regattas. James
Haddow, who coxed the Temple
Cup eight, went on to steer the
British lightweight men's eight
and came 5th in the final.
Other international appear-
ances included Angus Rivers,
who rowed in the coxless four at
this year's under 23 regatta, the
Nations Cup. Seb Pearce coxed
the British men's eight at the
World University
Championships. Ironically this
was the Oxford Brookes crew
who beat the 1st eight in the
Temple Cup at Henley.
Marret and Gillard, along with
their Oxford Brookes crewmates,
represented England at the
Commonwealth Regatta. More
controversy was in store when
they had to re-row for the bronze
medal against former Queen's
Tower members John Langley
and Tom Morgan. Once again,
they won the re-row and
achieved bronze, proving that
fitness over 4000m is a more
prudent tactic these days. Helen
Ellison and John Weale rowed
for Wales at the
Commonwealths, with Ellison
winning bronze in the women's
eight.
Simon Dennis, former member
of the British Olympic gold
medal men's eight from Sydney
2000, has now taken over as
the Boat Club's new head coach.
He inherits Bill Mason's 24-year
legacy of consistent success as a
coach at the top of British row-
ing. It includes 17 wins at
Henley Royal Regatta, 15 World
Championship medals, and
national chief coach for women
at the Atlanta Olympic Games,
and many who have been
coached by Bill have risen
through the ranks to enjoy suc-
cesses in the national team. He
will now work in a more sup-
portive role as Director of
Rowing at Imperial.
A dinner to celebrate Bill's life
and work at Imperial will take
place on Saturday 30 November
at the Hilton Olympia, London.
