Graduates Unprepared?
A new survey of final year uni-
versity students published today
reveals that 46% do not feel pre-
pared for work.
The survey of over 1,000 stu-
dents, conducted on behalf of
TeachFirst, found that two thirds
of students thought that
University should be about
preparing students for a profes-
sional career, but less than half
thought it had succeeded.
Students were questioned at
several universities across the
UK and Ireland. Oxbridge stu-
dents proved to be much more
theoretically-minded than
London students with only 43%
believing that university should
be about preparation for a pro-
fessional career. This was com-
pared to 70% of students ques-
tioned at UCL, LSE, Imperial and
Kings College London.
Additionally, it was discovered
that just over half of the students
know what they want to do after
they graduate.
Money was rated by students
as their primary goal for five
years after graduation, followed
closely by respect; family was
rated as their primary goal twen-
ty years after graduation.
Diana Warwick, chief execu-
tive of the umbrella group
Universities UK, said there was a
difference between enhancing
students' general skills and
preparing them for a specific job
or profession.
"Some jobs require a specific
degree subject, and additional
studies - others do not," said
Baroness Warwick. "What is
clear is that higher education
helps students develop transfer-
able skills that are useful in their
subsequent careers."
