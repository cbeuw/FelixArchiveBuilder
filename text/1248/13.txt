What with the careers fair, everyone around me
wondering what they are actually going to do
with their lives and the scary realisation that I
can not remain a perpetual student, I figure
now is a good time to start looking for a job.
Now, I would have thought that realising I
need a job would be enough but apparently
there are quite a few people looking for jobs.
Can't remember where I heard that but sup-
posedly it is true. So, the real challenge lies in
trying to convince people that you are the best
man or woman for the job. This is where web
sites like this become useful and frankly I am
willing to take advice from all directions if it
will improve my chances.
There are many different websites claiming
to offer good advice and millions of job vacan-
cies but I think this is one of the best. Clearly
laid out with a lot of information including a
particularly useful section on company profiles.
The frequently asked questions covers anything
from what to put in your CV to how to find out
about studying abroad. If you register (very
easy) then they will provide you with individual
advice on your CV as well as informing you of
jobs that are likely to be of interest. Once reg-
istered you can also display your CV on line for
employers to find you. I have always rather fan-
cied being head hunted but I think that is a lit-
tle unlikely.
By the way non-final years, it might be a
good idea for you to start looking too, don't

So, your so-called friends have sent yet anoth-
er really annoying forward. The first problem is
trying to open it - I usually get a message say-
ing "This attachment type is not yet support-
ed", pray tell me what does that mean? If you
manage to access the damn thing then there
is a really high probability that it is not funny,
not relevant and is certainly not worth your
mailbox megabytes. Then it gets worse, you
have to reply to whoever sent it to you without
mentioning their really poor sense of humour.
Well, guess what, I have discovered an entire
website dedicated to them. Just what you
always wanted. A true time waster and a bril-
liant way to annoy all your not-so-favourite
friends.
Many of these you will probably already
have been subjected to but this is a really
good way to waste valuable time . While the
forwards are divided into categories such as
'famous quotes' and 'heaven jokes' they are
unfortunately not titled. Which means you
have to open it to find out what it is.
In fact, I am now beginning to wonder why
I am reviewing a badly-designed, totally use-
less website. I remember, we all like to piss
people off from time to time. To be honest I
don't think this website has any other reason
for being.
If you're really bored then go ahead because
to be fair what else could anyone do with their
really annoying forwards if not put them here?
Oh yeah, delete them.
A lovely jumbly total waste of time and
effort and paper and printing ink

These websites contain microscopic photo
graphs of your favourite beverage, whether
that is beer or cocktails. I don't know if they
are actually right, perhaps someone with
access to crystallisation techniques and a
microscope could tell me. Nevertheless, they
are very cool pictures which look really swish.
You can download screensavers which you
can then modify to your tastes. All good fun.
leave it too late, most applications have
in by Christmas. Happy hunting.

DVD
They are the new video with better quality
audio and visual, with more features and
generally just brilliant - but what are they?
Digital Versatile/Video Discs use the
MPEG-2 compression technique to fit
enough megabytes for an entire movie on
one DVD. MPEG compression works by stor-
ing the changes from one frame to the next
instead of the whole frame.
DVDs can be described as a new type of
CD ROM that hold a minimum of 4.7GB.
They are certainly not solely for video, they
have also revolutionised the computer world,
with DVD drives outselling DVD players.

Yipee! It is now half way through the term
and I haven't yet tried throwing myself in
front of any buses. That's pretty good going
for me. I give myself another week before I
am found underneath the number 10 (which
it will be - the damn thing never runs on
time, I'd enjoy the irony).
I hope everyone found something useful at
the careers fair, like a career. If you, like me,
do not have everything already planned then
take a look at prospects. As for the second
site, do not send all the forwards to felix web
because I will not laugh.
