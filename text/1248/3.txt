And Alex Said...
"And now on BBC1, we interrupt
all half-decent programming to
bore you to death with this
year's... Children in Need."
Suddenly your eyelids are
descending faster than your bank
balance. Consciousness is fading
quicker than the chances that
you'll stick to your resolution to do
"a bit more work" this term. Your
body collapses in a heap, just like
the analogies in this paragraph.
Then you wake up to hear Toby
Anstis say "And now we cross
over to BBC Dullsby...".
"This crazy man is sitting in a
bath full of maggots!" shouts
Gaby Roslin.
"They're crawling up my nose. I
think they're biting me inside."
He's a man sitting in a bath, as
part of a line of men sitting in
baths, and the baths are full of
the typical "cray-zee" things that
baths get full of at this time of
year. You know: custard, gunge,
mud, goo, gunk, jelly, acid, fae-
ces, molten rock, water.
"And what about you, what's
this bath full of?"
"Razor blades" says a man, in a
bath full of razor blades.
"Owch! You must be completely
mad!"
"I was almost sectioned."
"What's your name?"
"I'm Sir Derek Roberts, Provost
of UCL"
this. The razor blades were his
idea," he says, somewhat glumly.
Standing to one side, there is a
deep laugh. "Keep up the good
work, Derek!" says Richard, with
a cackle. "It's this or the top-up
fees, you see," he says, turning to
Gaby Roslin. "Surprisingly warm,
under the glare of these lights," he
says, fanning himself with a large
handful of fifty pound notes.
Charity!
"And how much have you
raised for Children in Need?"
"Children in Need?"
"Yes... the BBC charity enter-
tainment phone-in extravaganza
type thing."
"Actually I'm raising money for
Imperial College and UCL...
Richard Sykes says we've got no
money at all. He made me do

Back to the studio, and there's
Nicky Campbell from Watchdog.
"Right, we've got Will Young and
Ann Widdecombe in the studio,
and as we said earlier, if we didn't
have four million pounds by now,
Ann would be performing a sexy
striptease. And as if things could-
n't get any worse, Will will be
singing. Let's check the totals..."
A minute later and the hell is in
full swing. Ann is in her under-
wear, and all the while Will is ser-
enading her with "I want to take
this moment, and make it last for-
ever..." You wonder whether he
really means it.
"Give us your money, give us
your fucking money, now, please!"
sobs Bob Geldof, eerily reminis-
cent of his famous Live Aid quote,
although this time the anger is
replaced by terror, and there are
tears in his eyes. "The smell is
appaling... people here are
dying!" he says, as Ann's bra
comes flying in his direction.
Will's song reaches a climax,
Nicky Campbell wipes the sick off
his chin and while Ann is danc-
ing, her breasts knock out two
cameramen. She moves a large
fold of skin out of the way and
reaches for her knickers, and
then...
Give generously.
