Poster Problems
Hi,
The union poster regulations
contain the rules:
Posters not to be put up closer
than 5 metres apart where there is
insufficient space.
Posters not to be put up over
other in date posters.
Presumably then, if one was to
put up some posters following all
the rules and particularly those
above, they would be left there
until the event had been and
gone. This is not the case, posters
are regularly ripped down a matter
of hours after they are put up. The
main offenders in this practice are
not rouge clubs and societies how-
ever, they are the wonderful,
unimpeachable fellows who wrote
the rules in the first place.
The union regularly carpet
bomb the main walkway and JCR
with swathes of huge posters
advertising their shitty events,
popular only with people who
would attend them regardless of
Your Letters
there being five inconspicuous
sheets of A4 or five million
hideously garish posters covering
every available square inch of col-
lege. Everyone knows cheesy wot-
sits is on three times a bloody
week, advertising is not the
answer for this lame duck.
Perhaps if the thousands of
pounds spent on advertising pis-
spoor events and inconsequental
referendums (for a supposedly
apolitical institution) were divert-
ed elswhere clubs might be able
to book a minibus when they need
one.
Political Update
Dear Felix,
After reading the letter last
week bitching about Southside
shop I thought I should contribute
to this worthy cause. I very rarely
buy things from the shop and gave
up trying to eat basics pizzas a
long time ago but am still a regu-
lar to the downstairs bit of
Southside bar. I was horrified last
Tuesday to see a small brown
mouse scurrying along behind
some seats. When I casually men-
tioned this to one of the lovely bar-
men, instead of looking terribly
embarrassed and offering me lots
of free drinks to compensate for
my traumatic experience he just
shrugged and said there's loads of
them around. Lovely. Do you think
the Grade II listed status
Southside apparently has includes
the original rodent population?
Talking of unwanted rodenty
types, I was fortunate enough last
week (privileges of being a coun-
cillors daughter) to have a very
interesting tour of the Houses of
Parliament followed by tea on the
terrace. I took this opportunity to
ask as many important people as
possible about top up fees and
they're opinion of our lovely Mr
Sykes. David Davis (Deputy
Leader of the Opposition) was vio-
lently against top up fees but did
admit that the bill may well get
passed when it goes to govern-
ment. A lovely little man who is
the mp for somewhere in
Bedfordshire talked for a good 20
minutes before I realised he was
cunningly avoiding giving any
opinions on anything, clever little
scamps these politicians. Another
terribly suave mp, who was also a
party whip ( how funny is that? I
spent a long time confirming with
him that it was his job primarily to
whip people) really liked the grad-
uate tax idea and also admitted
that Sykes was a conniving little
bastard (not quite his words, we
were in polite company, but the
look on his face was explanatory
enough). The general consensus is
that the top universities do need
more money but that top up fees
are not the answer, or at least not
right now. I think the best quote I
got by far was from an mp who
after hearing that I studied maths
said 'I'm awful at maths, I see
numbers as colours, I seriously
think a part of my brain is miss-
ing'. And he's helping to run the
country...
