Kosheen
Friday 25th October, Brixton Academy
4/5
On the final night of their latest
national tour, Kosheen played a
powerful, emotional and thoroughly
enjoyable set at a packed Brixton
Academy.
For the uninitiated, Kosheen are
DJs/producers Markee Substance
and Darren Decoder, together with
vocalist Sian Evans. Their debut
album Resist was released last year
and is still going strong, having
spawned four Top 20 singles, most
notably the thumping, hypnotic
Hide U. The key advantage they
hold over so many other groups is
their near-unique ability to blend
together flowing, addictive melodies
and powerful drum 'n' bass beats.
Right from the very first note, the
crowd were hooked - many of them
didn't stop jumping up and down all
night. I'd say this was due to the
sheer energy and emotion generated
by the band, but I suppose the
10.30pm start (and the resultant
more-time-in-the-pub factor) also
had a part to play.
Kosheen played through most of
the fifteen tracks on Resist, begin-
ning with the title track and ending
75 minutes later with Catch, part of
a rare encore. They also showcased
some new material, which, under-
standably, didn't go down quite as
well as the familiar album tracks.
Sadly, having watched Kosheen
play such a supremely confident set
at Pacha earlier this year, I couldn't
help feeling that the size of Brixton
Academy didn't quite suit them. The
complete absence of the guy on the
electronic 'cello was a disappoint-
ment, and perhaps they should
have readjusted the levels slightly to
make the vocals more audible.
But overall, this was another spe-
cial performance from one of the
very best live bands around - a band
whose stock just keeps on rising.

The Lsbertines-f Supergrass 3/5
Monday 28th October, Shepherd's Bush Empire
After a band that didn't register in
my memories of this concert, came
The Libertines. I was unbelievably
excited due to their brilliant album
which sweats and energises.
Ragged guitars shot through their
first notes with 'The Horror Show'.
Was it a bad omen? As I expected,
the guitarists were shaking arhyth-
mically, going haphazardly from
left to right on the stage.
The songs followed each other,
the musicians dropped their instru-
ments and fell into the blackness of
the stage without a look behind,
without a word. Everything was
depressingly quick: I was deeply
disappointed. They didn't pay any
attention to the audience, there
was no show as such, they were
almost puppets dancing on a stage
with music from a CD. Why? They
were lost in the space of a stage
where we can't see the audience
sweat, perhaps they need more pri-
vacy to enable exclusivity? Is this
the attitude London's supposed
finest are supposed to have? It
seems very unlikely that they were
urged by the Supergrass not to do
too much.
However, it is never easy to play
for people that you think didn't
come for you (even though I met a
lot of people that came for the
Libertines exclusively), but I think
that you should give all that you
have in your in order to make the
vibration fly above the concert hall.
Nevermind.
Then came Supergrass. They
had the material to make a show
with video cameras that threw on-
line images of the band on the bot-
tom wall, images of oscilloscopes,
but they had the elusive touch as
well. The audience was bewitched,
the power was flowing. But the big
monkeys (not the singer) were
behind the railings as the croco-
diles in front of a castle to ease
your frenetic dance, in and on the
audience. Everybody was having
fun and it is so better when both
parties can get their kicks.
Nelson
The
Polyphonic
Spree
There are very few people in
music who wear a grin as large
as Spree frontman Tim
DeLaughter.
After the initial wave of hype,
the public seemed to have lost
interest in this lot. Thankfully,
this second coming (on the day
of the Lord) shows why they
were proclaimed as the best live
band around in the first place.
The band walk out to a fer-
vent crowd and launch into
their near-perfect album. The
first thing that smacks you is
the frenetic energy of Spree.
A line-dancing brass section
and head banging choir section
are the order of the day. You can
understand why they are some-
times referred to as a cult, since
it is virtually impossible not to
be taken in by their overwhelm-
ing enthusiasm.
A special band needs a big
leader, which can be found in
Tim. At times it looks as though
he is tapping into some other-
worldly force, to bring spiralling
harmonies and never-ending
sing-a-longs.
It's The Sun is turned from a
haunting ballad into an epic
romp, and the new material,
especially 2000 Places,
becomes an instant crowd-
pleaser, although the inevitable
favourites remain Hanging
Around and the rollicking
Soldier Girl where Jarvis Cocker
is brought on to try his hand at
choir practice!
It's hard to imagine that The
Empire will witness this much
euphoria in the near future; if
you managed to leave without
at least a spring in your step,
you truly do have a heart of
stone. Whatever religion it is
they subscribe to, I'm sure
they'll have a lot of converts in
the coming months.
