Are you experienced'
William Sutcliffe
Dave, your average eighteen year
old, agrees to go to India with his
best mate's girlfriend, Liz, mainly
because he wants to pull her. Liz,
is obviously not interested and
quickly gets drawn into a yoga
cult leaving a terrified Dave to
travel round on his own. He
lurches round the country, getting
ill, offending people and trying to
see what travellers do all day.
Most of the time he's genuinely
unhappy but miraculously by the
time he's back home in the pub
the worst bits are forgotten and
he proudly realises he has man-
aged to rack up the obligatory
collection of stories he will need
for the start of university.
If you have been been travel-
ling, this is your Bridget Jones -
you'll sit there going "that's so
right" and chuckling. You'll have
been through most of the situa-
tions and met most of the people
described. It's incredibly sharp,
honest and funny.
If you haven't been travelling,
then this is a brilliant expose of
what those guys who turned up
with weird hair and tie-dyed
trousers in the first year did, hav-
ing spent their gap year on some
parent funded gnat-milking expe-
dition to the wilds of a country
you've never even heard of. You
absolutely must buy it.

Atomised
Michel Houellebecq
Only buy this book if Spar has run
out of bog roll, and you have
cholera plus a runny nose. It's
unmitigated crap. By the time I'd
finished it, I was so angry that I'd
devoted part of my life to it.
Counting the bobbles on flock
wallpaper would have been better.
It's supposedly a study of rela-
tionships in our "atomised" socie-
ty. Two half-brothers, Michel, a
molecular biologist, and Bruno, an
unsuccessful teacher, wander
depressingly through their lives,
getting laid occasionally and
spouting philosophical crap.
It's supposedly a telling insight
into the dysfunctional state of
modern life. Apparently France is
in danger of becoming a third
world country through the failure
of religion, moral decay and lazi-
ness of the population. Many peo-
ple don't like France, but this
seems to be going a bit far.
I do cerebral occasionally but I
know enough science to realise
that the biological diatribes are
well off the mark, which made me
sceptical of the philosophy. I feel
bad slagging off a book - it's meant
to be an outpouring of the soul,
like stripping naked in front of the
whole world. And here I am point-
ing and laughing but no, I can't be
nice about it - even the naked
woman on the front cover is ugly.

Faced with a far from appealing
front cover, which is a prime
example of bad-taste wallpaper,
and probable choice of several of
the characters within, I had my
reservations. However, Simon
Crump's book of three short sto-
ries surprised me by being both
highly enjoyable and thought
provoking. As they say, never
judge a book by its cover!
The first story, Monkey's
Birthday, introduces you to a
Monkey's Birthday and Other Stories
S i m o n C r u m p s
street of rather unsavoury char-
acters whose lives are inter-
twined. Their personalities,
revealed through a highly
descriptive narrative of the mun-
dane objects and routines which
fill their lives, left me wondering
- just how many homes are lit-
tered with free gifts from lager
promotions?
English Electric is a depressing
foray into the downfall of a man
after being made redundant.
Short and not very sweet but
eye-opening all the same. The
final story, Early Doors, intro-
duces you to the highly enter-
taining world of a conman and
his new wife. Has he finally
made it big?
These three stories have a
colourful cast of characters, per-
haps stereotyped, but that is to
be expected in such a small
space. I did enjoy the stereo-
types and Crump uses them to
his advantage, injecting them
with a surprising amount of
humanity. As a result, his char-
acters are fully rounded and live-
ly, inciting you to care about
them.
If you prefer to avoid the less
desirable side of life, then the
cast of wackos, drunks and con-
men may not be for you. But if
you want your eyes to be opened
to different outlooks on life, and
to investigate the motivations for
some of the most depraved
social behaviour, then perhaps
this is the book for you.
There's some strong social
comment here. For example,
Monkey's Birthday ends with a
crime, depicting the perpetrator
as a passive agent driven by cir-
cumstances and situations. I'm
not sure if this book should be
taken as an authority on these
situations. After all, it's just the
author's personal insight, but it'll
definitely spark thought in your
own mind. On a more superficial
level, this is thoroughly enter-
taining; a personal through-the-
keyhole into the lives of a diverse
range of lively characters.
