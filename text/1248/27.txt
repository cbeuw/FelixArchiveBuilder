Unlucky Seconds Very X-Country
IC II 0 4 Reading
The second ladies hockey team
were in their element once again
in yet another excellent match.
We were enocouraging each
other throughout, and ignored
all the insults the opposition
threw at us.
With only ten players on the
pitch we saw all sixteen mem-
bers of the Reading team turn
out in their matching purple kit
and we realised we were playing
the bitches from hell.
Having told nat that she
'would be' playing in goal - once
she had finished sulking - she
did an excellent job, growling
from her line and intimidating
the opposition. Belinda and
Katherine did an amazing job
defending and passing strong
balls up the wings to Anna and
Frances. Ysanne, even though
she was nursing a very painful
hangover, did well helping out
Kate, who also had a great
game, putting in a fantastic
effort throughout. They were
both really unlucky not to score
from their midfield positions.
Clare was able to whack balls
hard and fast up the right hand
side and this combined with
some awesome runs straight up
the middle from Marriane made
the team look very impressive
indeed.
All that needs to be said is
that the Ladie's seconds are a
superb team and that spirits are
running really high.
It was just unfortunate, how-
ever, that we didn't manage to
score and allowed the opposi-
tion to get four particularly
sneaky goals past us.
But well done girlies! And
especially well done to Jenny for
actually getting us organised
this week - she's slowly learning
how to be a great captain and
we have high hopes for her in
the future.

IC Virgins 0 - 22 Brighton
Although there has been some
debate whether Jenny pulled Ash
or Ash pulled Jenny, there is no
question over the fact that Aleks
pulled a 16 year old (Porkwell's
brother) so the Porkwells have had
all the action really.
Getting back to the rugby -
Looking at the opposition before
kick off, it looked like it would be
an even match and so it was for
60 of the 80 minutes. Our play in
the first half can only be described
as beautiful. There was low tack-
ling, running both forwards and
fast and hands were good espe-
cially in the torrential rain.
Notable good runs were made by
Gemma and Ash and only a lack
of support prevented us from
storming into the lead. The end of
the first half (a good 5 minutes
early) found is camped in our 22
and not a little pissed off.

The second half started as the
first had finished, playing on the
half way line for a good 15 min-
utes. Unfortunately, after that it
went tits up and they scored their
first try after sustained pressure on
the 5 yard line. After this, we kept
our heads up for a good 10 min-
utes before we decided to roll over
and die, and they put three more
tries past us in ten minutes,
enough said. By this point, we
were dropping like dead flies, with
the captain off the pitch, the vice-
captain - who may have cracked
her ribs - writhing in agony, and a
handful of minor complaints, it
was all too much, and the game
ended a couple of minutes early to
put us out of our misery. Women
of the match were Monkey and the
Ash Meister who were both lush.
Haven't got a game for a couple
of weeks now, so don't be too
upset when you haven't got any-
thing interesting to read in next
week's Felix... hehe.
As usual the turn out for the sec-
ond race of the series was some-
what down on everyone's favourite
Parliament Hill course. Perhaps
this was because it was the rain,
or maybe Jeff's reputation for
organising successful transport to
the race venue had preceded him.
Whatever the cause, it didn't seem
to affect the overall quality of the
field, which turned out to be supe-
rior to the first race.
In the men's race several
notable absentees and a strong
turn out from Brunei meant that IC
A team was unable to maintain
their impressive second place
overall from the Parliament Hill
leg. Finishing third, however, still
left us above all the ULU colleges
and only beaten by two PE teacher
training establishments. Captain
Dave Mulvee ran the fastest time
of the day coming individually
10th and was closely followed by
Chris Mullington, thus setting up a
personal rivalry. UL captain Oli
Thwaites was finally back to
somewhere near good form, whilst
team legend Gavin 'the Gopher'
made an appearance for yet
another IC sports team.
Unfortunately, due to the lack of
depth in the team this week, the
Bs and Cs couldn't quite live up to
the standards set previously, but
with the expected return to full
strength next week this result
should be reversed.
The women maintained their
excellent start to the season with
the As and Bs coming 5th and 8th
respectively, with the As being
2nd of the UL colleges just behind
King's. Emma Calderbank was the
first runner home for IC in 9th
place and good runs from Minna
and Zoe ensured the result. For IC
to have a women's B team is
unusual, but for them to do so well
is virtually unheard of. There
seems to be worryingly large num-
ber of girls at IC this year with a
love for mud, cold weather and
excruciating pain... long may it
continue.
