Look, Brighton Laings
How would you describe your
style? - Hippyish
What's your favourite accesso-
ry? - Sarongs, great over
trousers!
So what will the self respecting
Londoner be wearing this winter?
Well probably what they always
wear, but the shops will be stock-
ing the latest trends and here is
what will be included.
So what are this season's
essentials? Corduroy, in beige or
black, for trousers, skirts, hats,
bags and blazers. This is probably
one of the strongest looks for this
season, the cord trousers or skirts
should be worn with a chiffon
flowery blouse for women and
with a flowery vintage shirt for
men. However don't mix and
match cord, especially not black
and beige together.
Vintage or retro gear is still
here, this time for men's shirts
and women's accessories like
bags and shoes.
Winter is the time for big, snug-
gly coats and this season's style is
sheepskin. This is carried over
from last winter but this winter
sheepskin is less subtle, the coats
around at the moment are very
70's with exotic trims and big
hoods.
The final essential item is a
skinny scarf, the longer and loud-
er the better. It should be knitted
and probably stripy in all the
colours of the rainbow. French
Connection have a mens stripy
scarf which is slightly more subtle
for £25, it is imaginatively called
Mens multi stripe scarf.
Now for women we have four
styles for you to choose from.
There's gothic, starlet, grungy and
retro sport.
What about gothic? Sorry but
this does not mean that Slipknot
t-shirts or leather trousers are in,
this season's gothic look is less
scary and more sexy! Floaty chif-
fon is teamed with crochet knits
in black, with highlight colours of
claret (dark red) and plum (dark
purple).
A good key item for this trend is
a black, layered chiffon skirt e.g.
Topshop for £38. This can then
be worn with a crocheted black or
plum coloured top for a sexy party
outfit.
So who wants to be a starlet?
20's and 30's glamour is back,
but this time with a Hollywood
twist, a slightly darker version of
Marilyn. This is the ultimate party
look for all this years Christmas
parties, with sexy satin dresses
and faux fur. Over the top glamour
is the key with sequins and
Glam with chifffon and fur
embroidery, covering every inch.
The key item for this look is the
sheer wrap, worn over plain strap-
py tops, these look incredibly gor-
geous and come mostly in gold or
silver tones. Topshop do a beauti-
ful wrap, which is white with
brown sequin detail for £45, none
of these wraps are cheap due to
the embroidery or sequin detail on
them, but they are a good invest-
ment as they can be worn with a
range of things.
With the Starlet look comes the
RED matt lipstick, great if you can
wear it but makes most people
look like the undead.
How about grungy then?
Nirvana are back and with them
comes a new edge on the grunge
look, where blokey items like
parkas, bomber jackets or com-
bats are combined with ultra fem-
inine chiffon tops or skirts. This
trend includes the military look,
with faded khaki and retro mili-
tary badges etc. However camou-
flage is not back in and should be
avoided at all costs! Mango do a
fantastic green military coat for

If you're intending on visiting
the gym sometime soon to shed
some pounds and get a head start
before Christmas then you'll be
into retro sport. Well the 70's had
to be in somewhere, with jogging
bottoms, zip tops and t-shirts, all
covered in retro logos and in
bright colours. Not to be worn all
at once but the zip tops and t-
shirts look great with jeans.
So you've got your outfits sort-
ed, how about the accessories?
Boots and shoes have evil looking
pointed toes this winter, very
Cruella De Vil! Mainly in black or
brown but plum features in the
shoe department as well.
Bright red lipstick is always a
good colour and Office do a pair of
ankle boots in this colour called
'Pili Demi Boot' for £69.99.
Handbags are still essential and
have tassels, embroidery etc. or
are found in plain black leather.
Trends for men this season are
Ski sport, retro and navy.
The apres-ski look, without the
dodgy sunglasses. Lots of knits in
this look, with a slightly retro
edge, including this seasons odd-
Chunky Knits to keep you warm
est the trend the 'alpine sweater';
the ones with snowflakes and
bright colours on, very strange!
Also zip tops with retro stripes
and again a strangely 70's feel.
These knits are worn with
denim or tweed trousers and big
parkas or gillets (sleeveless
padded coats).
Retro, ah, that word again! This
season's retro is an excuse to
wear flamboyant shirts, with floral
print and frills... only for the very
brave.
Topman has a lovely green pais-
ley shirt for £25, it is actually
nicer than it sounds, which would
go well with a pair of flared jeans.
Cord flares and blazers are big
and colours should clash but
tastefully so, if there is such a
thing.
The skinny scarf look comes
under this heading and looks fab
with a retro style blazer.
Navy is a slightly odd trend that
has sneaked in to cover the more
tailored look, but includes other
items.
Big thick white woollen knits
are included in this trend, as are
stripes in navy blue of black.
Men never seem to do much in
the way of accessories but an
item I think is fantastic is the
Monkey Beanie, from Topman for
£10, v cute!
Now it is time for me to impart
a bit of fashion wisdom, as we are
poor students there is no point
trying to follow every trend and
changing your style every month.
It is better to simply buy some
of the key items, which can be
bought relatively inexpensively.

Firstly I would just like to raahhh! Some smart arse pointed out to me
that Cosmopolitans shouldn't have crushed ice in them. Well raahhh
to that, I like crushed ice, my housemate has (well had because it
broke) an ice crusher and how many students do you know who can
be bothered to chill glasses beforehand?
Anyway, to make your margarita you first stick salt to the rim of your
glass. Rubbing a wedge of lime around the rim does the trick. Now
juice a couple of limes and stir in a couple of teaspoons of sugar to
taste. Into a cocktail shaker put in some ice cubes, 2 measures of sil-
ver tequila, 1 measure of triple sec and your lime juice. Shake and
serve over ice, crushed ice in my opinion but if not, who cares? If you
think the crushed ice melts too quickly, drink faster. By the way, when
I say a measure I think I mean a double but these recipes have only
been tested in a drunken haze. My housemates seemed to appreciate
them even without the recommended baby orchid garnish.
