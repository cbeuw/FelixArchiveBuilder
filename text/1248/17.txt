Manic Street Preachers
Forever Delayed
5/5
The Manic Street Preachers
have had a successful career
since debuting with their double
LP Generation Terrorists in
1992. Ten years and 6 albums
later, they release a 'Best Of
titled Forever Delayed.
Those who don't know the
Manic Street Preachers can buy
this album without hesitation as
it contains almost all of their big
hits. You will discover one of the
better UK bands of the last ten
years. For hardcore fans, rush for
the limited edition version: there
is an extra CD of some of the
greatest remixes of the band's
hits by Chemical Brothers,
Avalanches, Massive Attack,
Mogwai... which is reason
enough to buy it. Moreover, you
will find songs from old albums
that you don't know. Forever
Delayed also includes two brand
new tracks and three which have
never previously been available
on an album.
This compilation is worth look-
ing at. All the songs are reason-
ably good. Put the CD in and
leave it playing till the end. The
Manic Street Preachers have
explored many different styles of
music, this album shows the way
from debut to nowadays. In these
times where 'Best Ofs' are fash-
ionable, (Elvis Presley, Rolling
Stones) Manic Street Preachers
release a decent one. Don't miss
it - this will keep you occupied
while waiting for their seventh
album! Mike
The Lollies

The Lollies - the name says it
all. It's an innocuous moniker
designed to lull the listener into
a false sense of security, as does
the sound itself - colourful key-
boards and catchy hooks mask
the lyrics of singer Kate
St.Claire. Her words are always
tongue, often cutting and at
times simply brilliant.
But back to that name for a
second. I've not tuned in to the
entertainment scene for a while,
but I'm pretty certain Steve
Lamacq has been raving about
this North American trio.
The Lollies (it's such a
Lamacq band-name), are up
there with those other Evening
Session favourites The Vandals.
As for the album itself - open-
ing batsman Flavah Of the
Week has The Lollies taking
several shots at the state of pop-
ular culture and the Dandy
Warhols (or are they?), and has
the album's first great lyric:
"Indie cred? 'Ha! I'm just a ho!
Sell my wedding photos to
Hello!".
Call the Girls is an anthem for
the females out there who aspire
to living like Daria; Office
Romance is a cheeky tale in the
vein of Princess Superstar (only
less explicit, unfortunately).
Channel Heaven is a decent
Belle & Sebastian pastiche and
Jamestown Massacre is an
attack on prom queen-culture
with Taste's second great lyric:
"Fernme Fatale all dressed in
black/Varnishcrack and
marathon slingbacks/Wear that
dress like a ball and
chain/Lipstick smeared like
novocaine".
The Lollies never stop trying
to be amusing or ironic and this
stops the album from being an
excellent debut. Sonically and
lyrically, it borders on light-
weight and silly too often. It will
be interesting to see if time will
mature their sound and sharpen
their wit. What is certain though
is that The Lollies are part of a
new wave of bands reinventing
the indie scene - The Strokes,
The Datsuns, the Yeah Yeah
Yeahs. The Lollies are as irrever-
ent, intelligent, hip and self-con-
scious as they come.

Singles
Athlete - Beautiful
Simple, catchy songs with
decent vocals and instrumen-
tal, and then ali sorts of
strange noises added on the top
of it all. This is what you can
expect from this up and coming
band. Athlete's new single is no
exception and is one of their
more "chilled" offerings.
Pleasant chords and synth
strings await you with this one.
The lyrics are straightforward
too - singer Joel Pott is describ-
ing something beautiful.
The overall effect is impres-
sive and pretty close to beauti-
ful in itself. The heavier instru-
mental towards the end is the
only extra thing this song needs
to convince me that it deserves
full marks, and it does so con-
vincingly.
5/5 Robin
The Liars - Fins To Make Us
More Fish-Like
"Can you hear us? CAN YOU
HEAR US?", my stereo sudden-
ly screams after what sounds
like a bunch of primary school
kids banging saucepans on a
washing-line. This shouldn't be
good but for some outlandishly
obscure reason it is.
The Liars are the next band
in the line of punk-meets-elec-
tronica but these New York lads
might just have that extra bit of
insanity to carry them through.
With their brilliantly named
album already receiving critical
acclaim and fantastic track
titles like Pillars Were Hollow
And Filled With Candy, where
could they possibly go wrong?
This 3-track EP has been
painted with punk stripes. A
dedicated craze surges through
every lyric with screeching
backing vocals thrown in for
good measure. Fast beats and
energetic riffs will get you danc-
ing before you realise it.
