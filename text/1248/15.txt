Continuing in my quest for all things media, I
gatecrashed a celeb party at the Kensington
Roof Gardens last week. Unfortunately, having
arrived fashionably late, I'd missed the stars
who apparently had turned up, got their pho-
tos taken and fucked off somewhere much
more interesting. Actually, since the "stars"
were dubious popsters Blue and Atomic Kitten,
I'm not sure if my tardiness was a blessing...
As a celeb-do virgin, I was a tad disappointed.
As parties go, it was quite lame, and things got
worse when they shut the free bar.
Not that I'm cheap or anything, but I did find
myself at another event with free alcohol this
week, and I have to say it flowed a lot more
bloody freely than in Kensington. Yes, Will
opened the Felix bar tab. A debaucherous time
was had by all, and everyone looked a little
grey and vaguely sheepish in the office today.
I'd love to reveal lots of exciting gossip, but I'll
have to get someone to fill me in on what hap-
pened first.
Which reminds me: get well soon, Simon!
The poor love wasn't feeling at all right today,
bless him. I sent him home and valiantly
agreed to finish off here. What, you feel too
sick and have to go home and leave me here
on my own to edit the pages as I wish to? Gosh
Simon, so much trust! I'm honoured. Foolish
boy...
So in his absence (which may or may not be
short-lived, depending on whether he contin-
ues to accept totally un-poisoned, completely
safe, un-tampered-with chocolate from sweet,
innocent co-editors...), I have made a couple
of minor changes, which I'm hoping you guys
like - we've slotted in a quick review for those
things we just can't cram in, and also experi-
mented with getting two perspectives on a
film. Originally it was going to be a "girls v
boys" feature, but apparently I haven't got girly
enough film taste for Si... If there are more fea-
tures, stories or anything else you want to see,
get emailing and we'll do our best, and let us
know if you like (or hate) anything about these
pages. Except the editors. Not that you could
possibly find fault with us. Well, me at any
rate... Liz

I messed up this week and got 2 reviews of the
same film. Simon wasn't happy. But, since they
are both very different, rather than choose one
over the other, I decided to include both... Liz

Harry's world has been recreated with stunning
visual style, with superb special effects: Dobby
the house-elf equals anything Mr. Lucas has done
recently, cars swoop with verve and realism and
there are spiders that would induce severe
arachnophobia in the most passionate entomolo-
gist. It is directed with a grandeur that perfectly
suits the mood of the film, and the pace is fairly
relentless. Beware though, there are a number of
sections that will make you squirm by their very
cheesiness.
Added to this, the kids' acting is still largely
awful, even if things have improved since the first
outing. Ron still does a Mr. Soft impersonation
when he's frightened, Hermione still has the over-
annunciation of a school presentation and Harry
is rivalling his wand for sheer woodiness. The
teachers have all settled into their roles nicely,
with the late Richard Harris bringing an under-
stated humility to Dumbledore, but the star of the
staffroom would have to be the OTT Gilderoy
Lockhart. Whether you love him or loathe him
will depend mainly on how much the sight of
Branagh makes your fists itch.
I could sit here nitpicking about any number of
things in the film, but overall it remains a very
enjoyable way to spend an evening. The humour
of the novels is cleverly captured and the story
remains in-keeping with the book - well-struc-
tured and intriguing. It is a much darker affair

Look! What's that over there? An acting coach?
than the first film, with some pretty scary scenes
for hardened students, let alone quivering 8 year
olds. But go on, get in touch with your inner wiz-
ard - it's certainly a lot cheaper than the mer-
chandising. Ben

The second installment of the Harry Potter series
was always going to be a sure money earner.
Unfortunately this did nothing to motivate the
production of the good film. The story was ripped
and slashed and at times incoherent, whilst there
was little else to compensate for that. As much as
the books can be hugely absorbing at times, this

film could be repulsing.
The story, both imaginative and intricate on
paper, is allowed to drown in an extremely indo-
lent screenplay. The plot never flows. Columbus
can be excused for skimming away many of the
minor stories and complexities (at two hours,
forty minutes the film can already be tediously
long) but he left the film without direction. The
script was terrible, containing too many cheap
and nauseating lines and the soundtrack was
jammed with melodramatic strings - the experi-
ence was similar to sitting through a three-hour
Werther's Original advert.
The best acting seen was probably Dobby the
computer-animated "house-elf" - one of the high-
lights of the film. Smith (McGonagall), Rickman
(Snape) and Branagh (Lockhart) created their
characters excellently, but unfortunately Harry,
Ron and Hermione did not live up to expecta-
tions. Their acting was wooden, and Watson is
the only one who looks likely to have a future
career.
I imagine for many under-twelves, the world
will be a happier place with The Chamber of
Secrets, but for me the beauty of JK Rowling's
books lies in her imaginative minute details. The
film lacks such qualities, resulting in something
ridiculous and disappointing. As I looked around,
there was little evidence of wonder on the audi-
ence's faces - the most frequent expression was a
cringe. Sachit
