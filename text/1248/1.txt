Strike Hits College
College was much quieter than
usual on Thursday when staff
walked out over pay across the
capital.
Official pickets were set up out-
side most entrances to College,
though movement around College
was generally unhindered, partic-
ularly for students. However, staff
protesting outside buildings
made up only a fraction of those
away from work, as many others
declined to cross picket lines,
regardless of their support for
strike action.
Many departments, such as
Physics, officially cancelled lec-
turers for the day, but in others
most lectures ran as normal.
At Imperial College Union, the
strike had little effect on student
services, despite some members
Picketers were in good spirits, but cold..
of staff walking out for the day.
Four of the main staff unions -
the Association of University
Teachers, Unison, NAFTHE and
Amicus - called a strike to
protest about the amount of extra
money awarded to university
workers in the capital. It has
been fixed at £2,134 since 1992
but the unions would like to see
that rise to around £4,000.
One member of technical staff
on strike told Felix, "We are very
bitter that management get
£16,000 London allowance and
they won't even talk to us."
Despite the strike, no talks
were scheduled between the
University of London and staff
unions to resolve the dispute.
Unison announced that a focus
of the strike would be the
Queen's visit to King's College,
where she is expected to open a
new library.
The AUT's general secretary
told the BBC "When reasonable
staff are pushed to strike, vice-
chancellors should sit down with
the unions and seek a resolution.
So far, they have not done this."

'Speaker Van Man' Is Back
A regular feature of life at
Imperial College returned this
week when men selling speakers
out of the back of a van started
pestering students.
The "speaker van man" phe-
nomenon crops up each year.
The van's passengers call a stu-
dent over as if to ask directions,
claim that they've had a delivery
of speakers rejected and that
they are trying to shift them at a
knock-down price.
In the past, the speakers have
found to be either broken or of
very low quality. Buyers have
also been asked to take the
salesmen to cash machines, and
physical threats have been made
against those who refuse to buy.
College Security strongly
advise students to stay away
from the vans - so far this week
a white van and a green van
(S904 NGW) have both been
used, and there may well be
more - but can do nothing to
stop them as long as they remain
on public roads. AW
