We Are Skint
3/5
This 'Best Of album uses the
money-spinning concept of put-
ting all of one record company's
biggest artists, as well as their
newest on a double CD and
hopefully introduce fans to those
newer acts.
Better known tracks are
placed on CD 1 - That Was Then
and new tracks on CD 2 - This Is
Now. This means the first album
is full of tried and tested
favourites including Fatboy
Slim's Rockafella Skank, X-
press 2's Lazy and Bentley
Rhythm Ace with Bentleys
Gonna Sort You Out. Stick this
on in your hall bedroom and it's
a ready-made party. This is what
all dance compilations aspire to-
a good mix of recognisable but
totally non cheesy tracks that all
sound different.
However, the second C D .
takes a little more effort. It
includes tracks by most of the
same artists as CD 1 - Lo
Fidelty Allstars and Midfield
General both appear again, but
the tracks are as yet unknown.
The direction Skint is heading in
seems to be away from big beat
and towards a slightly darker,
faster club sound. Listen to it a
few times and favourites for
future hits will emerge. There'll
be plenty of screaming in clubs
when these tracks kick in!
This will be good at a party,
but definitely better when it can
be put on towards the end when
you just want to stop the unin-
vited but wasted guests falling
asleep and drooling on the floor.
I conclude that this is an
excellent CD for the purposes of
looking cool and also having
something you'll want to listen
to - sort of a cross between Ibiza
2002 and some mixmag compi-
lation. It also has a very cool
case (worth mentioning, as can
be important to the style con-
scious). Also, for Skint fans,
there are exclusive tracks so
worth getting hold of to own
them before any one else does.
How many reasons do you
need?

A New Day At Midnight
3/5
It's been a long time coming,
this much anticipated follow-up
album to White Ladder.
Predictably, the first thing that is
asked will be how it compares to
White Ladder, something I'm
sure David Gray tried to avoid by
going on tour and just staying
away for a few years. However
the expectation is still there.
The album starts promisingly
with Deari in the Water, a slow
song with a lot more forceful
accompaniment than is usual in
David Gray's songs. It has a good
guitar riff before each verse.
Caroline is upbeat with a busy
drum beat in the background.
The guitar is also prominent with
a good solo. It then starts to slow
down to White Ladder territory.
Kangaroo has a clever beat
where it actually hops to sound
like a kangaroo.
However the middle of this
album start to sound a bit stale
and dull. Last Boat to America
has an interesting xylophone at
the beginning but it carries on for
the whole song. Nothing much
happens in the song and it just
gets boring. Luckily the last few
tracks of this album carry on
from the start. Be Mine has a
good rousing chorus from the rel-
atively tranquil verses.
Lyrically, the songs talk about
love themes and loss. Other Side
is about the loss of his father.
You can tell a lot of his emotions
are in the lyrics. This album is
sufficiently different to White
Ladder while retaining what
David Gray does best; good slow
emotionally charged songs.

Gluecifer - Basement Apes
Basement Apes? Well, judging
from the CD sleeve, this
Scandinavian collective does
look a bit hairy, scary and sun-
light deprived. Formed in '95 in
Oslo, after meeting each other
down a dark alleyway (proba-
bly), this band likes to rock.
And they do. Tracks such as
Round and Round (which might
as well have been by AC/DC)
and Easy Living, a single
released earlier this year, will
have you flexing those neck
muscles and wishing you had
long greasy hair to frantically
whip around, helicopter-style,
like the annoying girl in front of
you last night at the gig. With
titles such as Biff Malibu and
Raldo Useless (that's the band-
members' names, not the
songs, by the way), Gluecifer
could be mistaken for extras in
the Norwegian porn version of
'Mystery Men'. However, they
play their instruments like the
best of them, which are always
perfectly complimented by
vocalist Malibu's convincing
growls.
Although the tracks vary in
style from fast-paced rock to
only-slightly-less-fast-paced-
and-more-thoughtful rock,
Gluecifer's refusal to be monot-
onous is endearing, and basi-
cally distinguishes them from
the rest.
These basement apes swing
through the trees grunting, with
intention and retro-class, their
music not particularly evolved
in style, but definitely in quality.
