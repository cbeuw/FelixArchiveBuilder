We, the undersigned members
of B.I.G. (Bigoted Ignorant
Goofs) do hereby politely
inform Felix readers that we
will be annexing Focus on: next
week.
Each week, we will randomly
select a country from a list
published two issues previous-
ly. Your country could be the
lucky winner! Our programme
will then be to thoroughly
besmirch the reputation of
that country. Be warned, no
holds barred*.

*We dislike not being able to apply "small print" to its logical extremes
in the following qualifying clause, but we are being threatened with exile
to somewhere foreign so we'll content ourselves with applying it to this
rather superfluous paragraph. As to the above, the picture says it all
Besistance is not quite futile.
To avert us trashing your
country on this very page you
merely have to write in a para-
graph about some aspect of
your country. Something along
the lines of random national
sports, ways and places to
have a successful social life in
your hometown, interesting
foods, local cheesy pop and
alternatives, strange sayings -
you get the idea.
On the scaffold this week are
Nigeria, Korea, Brazil and
Japan. Anonymously or other-
wise, nationals of these coun-
tries, send stuff in, or else...
Focus on: C D * * *
Mastery of a country can be
assumed when you understand
its poetry and humour. Adulation
is due if you don't share a com-
mon mother tongue with that
country.
You've all been able to satisfy
Imperial's fairly stringent English
ability requirements, and so are
ready for initiation into the world
of British comedy. I assume little
prior knowledge, and hasten to
add that this will be extended
over several Felices.
This week deals with (fairly
recent) historical comedy. I'll
leave the great guns to the
literati, but in passing make sure
you have a look at Shakespeare
and Jane Austen.
I implore you to accompany
this with an elementary British
history primer (or risk having a
very skewed view of the last 900
years in Britain), but Seller and
Yeatman's 1066 and All That is a
masterpiece, and will give many
insights into how we perceive the
world.
The following books will glad-
den those amongst you who
hoped to see stereotyped Britain
(cucumber sandwiches, tea etc).
Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in
a Boat is a good place to start.
The title, a reference to a nursery
rhyme, makes the subject clear.
Oscar Wilde is seminal, and
you'll easily find plays, stories
and film adaptations. RG.
Woodhouse is fairly flippant, and
breezes through the stereotypes.
The Jeeves and Wooster books
got a good TV series with Stephen
Fry and Hugh Laurie. Evelyn
Waugh is much more subtle, and
though you'll have to overlook the
racist mindset of many of his gen-
eration, Decline and Fall and
Scoop are great.
Punch magazine was a work-
horse for a very long time, and
has recently been reincarnated,
but you'll have to look up the ear-
lier stuff if you want top quality.
Of especial note are the cartoons
of H. M. Bateman, of The Man
Who... series.
Although these are strictly
speaking contemporary, the sub-
ject matter is historical. You
should be able to see Life of
Brian and Holy Grail, Monty
Python films and the Blackadder
TV series very easily soon as
Christmas and the re-run season
approaches. Ask many Brits
about these two, and they'll hap-
pily wax lyrical about them and
possibly provide you with oppor-
tunities to view them. Encourage
them.
Cholmondely
We've been relegated this week,
as we don't have a lot to say.
However, we are prepared to say
it very loudly. Therefore we'll be
endeavouring to displace
Cholmondely and resist takeover
bids from the Bigots through
sheer volume. Anyway, onto less
self-involved matters: We've
been to go and see Ten, the film
by Abbas Kiarostami. It's on at
the ICA almost daily until the
end of this month.
www.ica.org.uk for details.
The life of a divorcee (Mania
Akbari) in modern Iran goes
under the microscope, as we
observe her relationships with
her resentful, possessive young
son, her husband, sister and sev-
eral other women, including a
prostitute. Filmed entirely from
inside her car, it's hard to know
whether to focus on the car inte-
rior, or to try and get fleeting
glimpses of Tehran through the
windows. It's subtly thought-pro-
voking, and well worth going
along to. Soon!
