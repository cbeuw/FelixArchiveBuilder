Return to Killinbuckton
I wonder how many of you remember the
Killinbuckton puzzle of issue no 624. If you
remember, British Rail were running a direct
route from Killinbuckton to Higher Pay rise,
but were having trouble turning the train
round at Killinbuckton. Now, having found this
route quite popular, they've decided to add
another restaurant car, to make sure everyone
gets fed up with the journey. Sir Peter Carr-
Parker-Tendant has deemed that this shall go
with the other restaurant car.
The problem, then, is this:
1. The train arrives from Higher Payrise in
the order: locomotive, second class coach,
restaurant car, restaurant car, Pullman car; it
must leave in the same order, but facing in the
opposite direction.
2. The locomotive and the Pullman car
must have been turned around when they
leave, the two restaurant cars and the second
class coach need not be.
3. There is no ordering to the restaurant
cars; they may leave in any order.
4. Killinbuckton is entirely flat, hence no
rolling of vehicles is allowed.
5. Nothing can move without being coupled
to the locomotive.
6. Nothing can move round an acute angle.
7. Everything must be at a standstill for
coupling or uncoupling to take place (no
'pushing').
8. The locomotive can move in both
directions.
9. The figures indicate how many vehicles
will fit in each section of track.
What is the minimum number of moves
required to turn the train (the first move starts
with the train standing on the line from Higher
Payrise; a move ends whenever the locomotive
has to stop for coupling, uncoupling or a
change of direction)? Please give an idea of
how you turned the train round, and please
read all the rules—it'll save my headaches
'\en I try to work out how many moves you
\ mean.

Going back to 'A Word In Your Ear', I have
had a complaint from Scaramouche. Appar-
ently, 'latchstrings'Is hyphenated in Chambers
20th Century Dictionary and Scaramouche
suggests aiatchsprings as the longest two-
vowel, two-syllable word: however, looking in
my Collins English Dictionary, I found that
/atchstrings was all one word, and uvatch-
springs does not feature at all. Over to you,
Scaramouche!
m i :
There are 27 lines Iff: to be completed, of
which 15 will earn a player anoiner line by
completing a box. So assuming no line
completes two boxes simultaneously, there
are twelve turns left in the game, which means
that since it is your turn to play, your opponent
will have the critical last move fas explained
last week). But every line which completes two
boxes (a 'double-cross') will wusie precisely
one move, so your strategy is therefore to
ensure there are an odd number of double-
cross moves played. Now I explained last week
that every long chain except the last will result
in a double-cross (when the two-square
sacrifice is madp to gain control of the next
chain) so you must aim for an even number of
long chains. In the diagram, the area
immediately above the centre line is already a
long chain, and the aiea immediately below it
will develop into on'i very soon. The two
squares in the bottom left hand corner cannot
form a long chain, so you must prevent your
opponent making the group of three in the top
left into a long chain. He can do this next move
by playing horizontally from the top left hand
dot and the only way you can prevent this
without allowing him to force another double-
cross is to play the double line shown in the
diagram, sacrificing two squares.
