CONTACT]
W E E K 5th - 13th Feb
The Chaplaincy Contact WivA, is
with us once again, starting
tomorrow (Saturday February 5)
and ending on Sunday February K:
This is the time wliich first and
second year and postgraduate
members of the Chaplaincy anti
cipate with eagerness, appro
hension or cold-blooded fear in
various proportions. First-year
members don't know what to
expect. For myself, I enjoy these
times when work which one should
be doing goes by the board (bored?)
anyway, and when one pulls out all
the stops and stops which one never
knew even existed. In my first year
at Garden Hall I organised events: a
party with plenty of food and drink
to which nobody came, and herbal
tea-tasting sessions (a whimsical
experiment which was certainly
funny...nobody came to them
either). BUT we had lunch together
on Sunday, a walk in the park und a
visit to the theatre. Our Contact
Week person was a nun, which is
someone you don't get to talk to
every day of your life. I was
surprised to discover that she didn't
think Christianity was the only true
religion. Other Contact Week
visitors include religious deep-
thinkers, theological students,
deacons and deaconesses, priests
and vicars (hence last year's
expression 'Knickers to vicars,
Nuns are more fun').
Contact Week is the biggest event
of the West London Chaplaincy.
People from many and varied
religious walks of life come from
near and far to Imperial College and
elsewhere. Each member of the
Contact Week team is assigned to
one or more Chaplaincy groups,
either a Hall of Residence or
departmental group, or both. The
groups meet more often than usual,
sometimes once a day or more, and
thereby get to know each other
better. The aims of the Week are
thus: (1) to develon the life of each
group and bring in fresh ideas; (2) to
contact or re-contact ottier people
in the hall or department; and (3) to
talk individually to a mature
Christian with a different religious
outlook on life. Anyone and every-
one is of course very welcome.
Details ot euenls in your own hall or
department will he advertised by
posters. Whv not lake a break from
science or engineering, shop-talk,
cynicism, apathy and beer-swilling
and run away from Imperial College.
Too drastic? Then come to a
Contact Week group meeting.
The people who are coming, and
the groups to which they are
assigned, are outlined below.
