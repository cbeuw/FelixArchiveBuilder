If you walk northwards along Exhibition Road
and cross over into the Park, two minutes
further on, on the Kensington Gardens (left
hand) side of the road, you will come across
the Serpentine Gallery. Exhibitions of modern
art are shown there by the Arts Council and
currently the gallery is shared by two
exhibitions of works made during the last
fourteen years. Both Tony Carter (sculptor)
and Martin Froy (painter) take reality as their
starting point, but that's about the only link
between them. Martin Froy most frequently
uses the orthodox media of oils and
watercolours to express impressions of
interiors and landscapes: Tony Carter
employs any medium, or combination of
media, to give concrete expression to his
sensations and ideas.
Paintings, constructions, drawings
Froy's 140 works demonstrate his continuous
experimentation within the two dimensions of
canvas and paper, and sometimes border on
the third dimension with 'bas relief con-
structions.
Two landscapes hang side by side, one in
the acid lemon and lime green colours of a
spring hedgerow, the other in shades of
bleached denim and rolled oats—a cold, empty
beach. In both the paint is applied thickly; the
surfaces are encrusted, and mottled like a
Berber carpet. His two kitchen interiors share
none of this emphasis on surface texture.
Smooth-edged areas of colour depict shape
and suggest fruit and vegetables, a dresser
with the top drawer open and a homely clutter
IREVIEWSI
of pots and jars. The colours are those of
sunshine on candy—soft blue-greens and gold
with splashes of vibrant pink. The same soft
luminosity is recognisable in some of Froy's
watercolours: 'Primaries' and 'The Loire at
Pouilly' have the appeal of life through rose-
tinted spectacles. By contrast, his biue and
grey watercolours show a precisely observed
world of strawberry plants, Welsh hills and
summer thunderstorms.
In her introduction to the exhibition
catalogue, Judy Marie writes that Froy is
driven by a determination that each work
'should impress itself at once as being alive and
genuine'—the life in his pictures is unques-
tionable. It's a positive self-confident life,
sometimes gaudy, occasionally subdued,
rarely straying from the path of good taste. As
such, it would grace most walls, with little risk
of causing offence.
Images of subject/object duality
If Froy's work has much immediate appeal—to
the eye and the emotions—Tony Carter's
sculptures are either easier, or a lot harder, to
get to grips with. The objects he uses are
undisguised—a spirit level, a saucepan, a
knife—but have been subtly changed, by their
setting or by the process of their 'decoration',
in accordance with the artist's subjective
vision.
Two precision engineered tuning forks, one
bronze, one steel have gracefully ornate, even
botanical, prongs. They have the title 'Spring
song—season turning'...sprung steel...turned,
pointed foot...two notes, as in the first cuckoo
of spring...! The craftsmanship is superb, the
resultant objects beautiful, and the title a joky
riddle. This is both the appeal and the
frustration of Carter's 3-D still life sculptures.
Their subject/object duality is a cryptic tease,
a sort of visual Times crossword and, just like
3 - D O W N , may be either rewarding or
bamboozling.
