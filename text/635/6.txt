HOW WILLYOU
SURVIVE BETWEEN
GRADUATION
AND REMUNERATION?
Our Survival Kit for Students doesn't end when
your grant does.
We know that the period between graduation
and your first pay cheque can be dauntingly expensive.
Indeed, it's one of the times you'll probably need
us most.
Or at least, need our money.
That's why we have a special Graduate Loan
Scheme to help set you up for starting work.
With a loan of up to .000 in your bank account,
you can start your new life in the manner to which you
expect to become accustomed.
You could, for example, use it to put down a
deposit on a new flat.
Or to refit your wardrobe with clothes for the
office rather than the lecture room.
\bu may, if you're sensible, even choose to use
part of the loan on a season ticket.
Apart from easing the transition into working
life, our loan also eases the repayments.
We'll give you up to three clear months to get
settled in before you start paying us back.
After this you'll have 12 months to repay the loan
at competitive interest rates.
Not surprisingly, an offer as valuable as this has
one or two conditions.
You must, of course, have a degree.
And you must also have had a firm job offer
from an employer.
However, if you still don't have a job to go to
when you leave college don't worry.
Our offer stays open for a full six months after
you graduate.
First, though, you'll need to talk to your Student
Business Officer before you graduate.
They'll explain the loan scheme in detail.
And make sure that when you do eventually
need the money, it's available immediately.
