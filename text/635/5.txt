Democracy in ICU
Simon Rodan. Imperial College
Union's External Affairs Officer,
has written a letter to FELIX,
printed on page 2. which critic-
ises IC students for the result of
the WIST motion at Tuesday's
Union General Meeting, he
argues that quality of argument
and moving oratory counted for
little, and the only influence on
the final result was the number
of people in favour of one side
over the other. 'How can this be
democracy?' he asks.
Certain members of WIST
advanced a similar argument.
Surely, they said, supposing only
a handful of student.' were
opposed to. say. racism, then the
majority in favour of racism
should not be allowed to win.
Both arguments are wrong.
The whole point of democracy
(literally 'government by the
crowd') is that it consists of
legislating in accordance with
the wishes of the majority: it
does not (indeed cannot) make
exceptions when the majority are
biased, uninformed, stupid,
immoral or just plain wrong.
And if a couple of hundred
Miners choose to 'sacrifice their
individuality' (as was alleged)
and vote just as Nigel Walls tells
them to. then thev must be
allowed to do so. Had anyone
forced them to support their
president, principles of demo-
cracy would have been violated,
and complaints would have been
in order. But every individual
EDITORIAL
member of the Royal School of
Mines was entitled to vote
according to his or her con-
science, and the fact that enough
of them felt so strongly about
the m o t i o n that they were
prepared to show up in force is
perfectly in ordei, anu there is
little point in anybody complain-
ing.
Democracy is far from ideal as
a system of government and it
has many weaknessness. notably
the majority often have little
idea what is best for them, but it
is generally acknowledged in the
Western world to have fewer and
less serious weaknesses than
other forms of government, and
until someone comes up with
something better, democracy
will have to serve as best it can.
This said, there are certain
prerequisites for a meeting to be
run democratically, some of
which came dangerously close to
being broken on Tuesday.
It is obvious that when a vote
is taken, the votes must be
counted fairly and accurately,
yet the tellers were so badly
organised on Tuesday that
during the first card vote whole
blocks of seats were counted
twice, and even after the second
card vote the final result was
announced prematurely, and
many people are still under the
impression that the motion was
only defeated by six votes. When
the hall is as packed as it was on
Tuesday, it is essential for the
Union officers to divide the
audience into separate blocks so
that each section can be carefully
counted by the tellers. The
Chairman should then collect all
the figures together, check that
he has been given the totals for
all parts of the hall, and then and
only then give them to the Union
Administrator for adding up.
There is no point in having a
card vote at all if the counting is
the mad scramble it became on
Tuesday.
Window Cleaning — The Final
Instalment
The window cleaners who were
employed to clean Southside
have now finished and been
paid, so it is now safe to leave
your wardrobes unlocked again.
Presumably the reason so many
rooms didn't have their windows
cleaned is that it was necessary
to conserve water.
Late Notices
Michael Arthur has asked me to
inform you of a vacancy for a
student (preferably writing up)
to man a hotel reception desk
during the day. Almost no actual
work is involved, as the job
mainly involves just being there.
Remuneration is negotiable.
Contact Student Services for
details. v
After last Tuesday's U G M a
yellow r u c k s a c k , a squash
racket, and a Unichem bag
containing hair care products
were found in the Great Hall.
They may be claimed from the
Union Office.
Finally, may I remind you
that next Friday is the nearest to
Valentine's Day, and seasonal
small ads must be in by Monday
5:30pm.

LET M E M A K E a suggestion to
anyone who wishes to get
Stephen Goulder worried: ailow
him to overheat the words
'Emergency M o t i o n ' shortly
before the next U G M . For
Stephen is becoming regularly
paranoid that sooner or later
someone is going to propose an
emergency motion of no confi-
dence in him. At the last two or
three UGMs, he has been quite
certain that he was due to be 'no
confidenccd'. This week, for
reasons about to be explained,
he actually went so far as to
write a speech opposing the non-
existent motion. It came about
like this.
On Monday afternoon, the
day before the meeting. Martin
Taylor visited John McCallion
in the Unic n Office. Since the
subject of lis visit was rather
sensitive, Martin didn't want all
the world and his dog to
overhear and so he asked John if
they could talk privately in his
office. The effect on Stephen
FELIX
BELOW
Goulder was remarkable: he
I visibly paled and as soon as
Martin and John had left, went
into his own office and spent the
next ive minutes with his car to
the door hoping to overhear the
details of what must surely be
treasonous plans to overthrow
the President.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y J o h n and
M a r t i n are well aware of
Stephen's fears and suspected he
might be listening in. and so they
stifleJ giggles and fabricated a
perfectly serious conversation
about whether Nick Pyne would
accept the motion, and whether
Stephen had found out about it,
and whether the U G M would
vote against him or not.
When the mischevious pair
left the office later, Stephen's
face had turned from white to
grey, and later that evening he
actually left the bar early to

allow himself time to prepare an
opposing speech. As if anyone
would bring themselves to speak
against such a well-loved and
hard-working President!
C O N S I D E R I N G T H A T writing
a music review allows such
wonderful potential for veno-
mous insults, one cannot fail to
be impressed at the benevolent
tact of IC Orchestra's former
leader David Bogle, particularly
since the object of his criticism is
the widely-disliked Warden Don
Monro.
Don is conductor of the
Consort Chamber Orchestra,
known rather less pretentiously
as String Band, and reading
between the lines of Criticon's
review of their last concert, M r
Bogle is less than impressed with
Don's contacting.
Yet he is so polite about it all.
'Don Monro would be the first
to point OIM that he is learning
his conducting technique' he
4 1983 H H H H B W H H
writes. Isn't that so much more
genteel than saying that Don
hasn't got a clue about con-
ducting and is in considerable
doubt over which end of the
baton he should hold.
DID Y O U NOTICE the open-
ings of the first few paragraphs
of the report Stephen Goulder
submitted to the U G M ?
'Hopefully everybody will
have read the article in FELIX...
'As reported in FELIX...' >
The concern held by many of
us, and voiced by Martin Taylor
in F E L I X '
How gratifying to know that
our Executive take the Union
newspaper so seriously!
A N D F I N A L L Y , next week I'll
be announcing the results of the
ET lookalike competition: any
last minute entries?
