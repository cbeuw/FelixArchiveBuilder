Saved!
A move to force M a r t i n S
Taylor, the F E L I X Editor, to
undergo Exec Torture foundered
on M o n d a y evening. A t a
meeting of the Publications
Board, Union President Stephen
Goulder suggested that M r
Taylor should join the rest of the
Union Executive when they iiave
rotting organic matter poured
over them to raise money for
Rag.
Deputy President John Mc-
Callion stated that the Exec
Torture posed a considerable
health hazard to the recipients
and raised comparatively little
money for Rag after the cost of
the materials had been deducted.
After the Pub Board Chairman,
Mike Prosser, had described M r
Goulder's proposition as emo-
tional blackmail, the motion was
defeated on the vote.
Rats!
Rats were discovered in the
basement kitchen of Montpelier
Hall by residents earlier on this
week. The Warden, Dr Don
Monro, was prompty informed
and so was College Administra-
tion which has called in a pest
control firm. Dr Monro did not
seem very worried about the
discovery and commented:
"There probably are rats in
Southside basement, too. The
rat population of London is
greater than the human popula-
tion." Dr Monro revealed that
sometime back there had been
reports of rats in Weeks Hall
basement, which had been dealt
with successfully.
Bomb Hoax
Police received a telephone call
on Wednesday night claiming
that there was a bomb at
Imperial. The caller was believed
to be a woman who had been
refused access to College earlier
that night, and the College was
not cleared.
Acid Splash
A student was seriously hurt in a
laboratory accident on Tuesday.
Kevan Reeve, a postgraduate
student in chemistry and last
year's A C C Chairman, may lose
the sight of one eye after being
splashed with chromic acid. Mr
Reeve was wearing safety glasses.
Seen but
not Heard
ICU Welfare Officer Jon Barnett
walked out of Tuesday's UGM
after a procedural motion that he
be not heard.
Mr Barnett had asked to make
a speech for abstentions in the
motion on sexually explicit
events on union premises. He
wanted to stress that whatever
his own a f f i l i a t i o n , it was
important that students should
be given the chance to abstain. A
motion was then accepted that
he should not be heard. He then
walked out. M r Barnett felt that
his motion was refused, without
a valid reason given, which he
considered surprising in view of
the Miners slogan of freedom for
the individual. The Chairman
said that he had allowed refusal
of M r Barnett's speech as he was
concerned that he would lose all
control of the meeting.
Jon Barnett subsequently
resigned as U n i o n Welfare
Officer in protest, but his
resignation was not accepted by
Union President Stephen Gould-
MURDER
Emmanuel Kapoma, a Zambian
student at Paddington Technical
College was beaten to death in
his hostel, Zebra House, in
Kensington on January 20.
M r Kapoma was friendly with
a white girl at Imperial College,
who may have been with him at
a party organised by the Ken-
sington Committee for Friend-
ship for Overseas Students.
Kensington Police are appealing
for that girl, or anyone else with
information, to contact them at
the Earls Court Road Police
Station, telephone number 01-
741 6212.
