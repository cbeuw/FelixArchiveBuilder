Dear Sir
As the girlfriend of a third
year Mining student, and one
who attended Friday night's
Mines Review, I should like to
make a few comments on my
impression of the evening, and
answer in part the points raised
in M r Kelsey's letter which,
appear in your January 28 issue.
I found Friday night's enter-
taining neither offensive, dis-
gusting, degrading, or porno-
graphic and you may be inter-
ested to know nor did any of the
other girls I spoke to. In reply to
Mr Kelsey's letter:
1. In no way could the film
that was shown on Friday be
described as 'pornographic'. I
feel a better description would
be 'mildly amusing'.
2. I did not feel that the
proceedings were in the least bit
offensive to women. The whole
evening was meant, and taken,
in a light-hearted jocular fashion.
I would never presume to state
what was offensive to men—I do
not see how he could possibly
categorically declare what is
offensive to women.
3. Let me assure M r Kelsey
that I did not feel de-humanised
in the least.
As to the comment that "lust
replaces love; rape replaces
sex". Anybody affected in this
way by the Review I suspect is in
serious need of help.
4. In M r Kelsey's third point
that such events degrade sex—
I'm afraid I fail to see the
connection between 'humorous
titilation' and a sexual relation-
ship between two people. He
goes on to say that in this day
and age, 'pornography is the
theory, rape the practice', I
would say that anybody who
takes pornography in a serious
and disturbing way may very
well be a danger to soceity, but I
cannot believe that a group of
people laughing at a slightly
more bizarre aspect of life poses
a real threat. ,, -

Dear Martin
The 'freedom of will' argu-
ment used in last week's editorial
to justify pornography (if all
parties consent), has a funda-
mental flaw. You said that if a
person commits rape then they
will be punished by law. If my
daughter/girl friend/mother was
raped I would feel 'hang the
bastard' rather than saying
'OK, he will be punished by the
law'. Law exists to protect not
punish (hence the drink and
drive law, as an excellent
example of this).
I would have thought that the
evidence presented last week just-
ified the statement that porno-
graphy especially when violent,
dehumanised the victim in the
sight of the 'observer', but judg-
ing by the response more reason-
ing is needed. We are all affected
by the world around us, this is
obvious in children, but people of
all ages are affected. As an
extreme example, men put
through terrifying ordeals in
wars, often end up deeply
psychologically disturbed.
In pornography the attention
is drawn (pulse quickens etc),
the mind becomes totally ab-
sorbed and the tension which
the 'performer' builds up is in
the body alone. It is this
extreme tension in why people
enjoy it (note motor-racing
drivers, etc, all enjoy the tension
involved in the sport, and not so
much the driving round a track).
Since this tension is caused by
the body, then the body becomes
the critical factor involved,
hence the dehumanisation. This
applies much more if the scenes
are violent because these cause
further tension (more excite-
ment) so there is a tendency to
enjoy these acts of violence. I am
not saying that a person actually
thinks that a woman (or man) is
not human but, to take a lesser
example, if a certain person is
constantly being humiliated then
sooner or later someone will
injure the victim because of an
attitude rather than a thought.
One of the ways the Third Reich
dehumanised Jews was to force
nude Jewesses to dance on
tables—this was a positive policy
of theirs, not an accidental side
to enjoyment.
It is sometimes said of sport
that it gets rid of aggression by
being aggressive and sexual
desires are got rid of by porno-
graphy (especially if violent it
seems). From reports of violent
football crowds this may seem
improbable, but as those are
minorities they are not really an
argument against this idea. For
the majority, who play and
presumably those who watch,
enjoy the competition and skill
rather than beating hell out of
each other. yo u r s sjlur,r/y

Dear Martin
The question of the
male/female ratio at IC is worth
a few sentences. The reason
there are so few women at IC is
because at school they are
stuffed with Victorian middle-
class attitudes and discouraged
from studying technical subjects.
It has nothing to do with the
social atmosphere here, of which
they are almost totally ignorant.
Many other students living in
London don't know what it's
like at IC, so how on earth are
high-school girls from the
Midlands expected to know? The
Mines Review is a symptom of
the ratio at I C , and cannot
plausibly be advanced as a
cause.

Dear Martin
I write to express my deep
concern at M r Farzi Deravi's
letter in the last issue of FELIX.
It is a letter the style of which
is indicative of those who wish to
reduce issues of political decision-
making to the level of personal
abuse.
After lengthy discussion the
Executive Committee unani-
mously decided to remove some
posters; posters that depicted
mutilated corpses with the
headline 'Zionist Atrocities in
Lebanon', posters which the
Islamic Society agreed not to use
at Freshers' Fair, considered by
the Executive to be an un-
necessarily sensational way in
which to express a point of view.
To allege that members of the
Executive are psychotic (suf-
fering from a severe mental
derangement of personality)
clearly constitutes a l i b e l ,
therefore should such allegations
be repeated appropriate action
will be taken.
If people think their views are
enhanced by surrounding them
with such defamatory statements
then, I am afraid, they are sadly
mistaken.
Power brings responsibility. It
would be shamefully irres-
ponsible if I were to permit this
Union to become the venue for
the tyranny of mindless fana-
ticism.
/ remain, sir, yours sincerely

Dear Martin
1 am writing to inform your
readers that I was a witness to an
incident similar to that described
in one of last week's letters. A
number of posters that depicted
the massacre of civilians in
L e b a n o n , displayed by the
Hellenic Society, were removed
by Mr Goulder on the grounds
that they were 'sensational'.
'Freedom of expression' was
the argument used by many
intelligent people, including
members of the Union Exec, for
not banning last week's Mines
Review. Yet. this right was quite
blatantly violated m the inci-
dents mentioned abo\e. Ironi-
cally, the Human R i f c M s Week
was organised to show what
abuse of power and tyranny lead
to.
It must also be mentioned
here, that the only posters
removed by Mr Goulder were
related to the Lebanese issue.
Other 'sensational' posters on
display in the JCR were not
affected.
Yours faithful!)

Sir
I observed with interest at the
U G M the antics of the Mines
block vote. Cheers, jeers,
applause and cat-calls all to
order. Further. R S M U football
and rugby training was cancelled
specially. A n d what was the
publicised purpose of this
mindless unanimity? The defence
of the rights of the individual!
Yours in doubt

Dear Sir
I am issuing a challenge to the
Left Alliance at IC. Stand up
and be counted at the next
U G M .
The only thing to emerge
from the farce that purported to
democracy on Tuesday was that
issues are irrelevant to Union
Policy: numbers are not.
The side with the better
argument has no guarantee of
ever being heard. The quality of
the speech in terms of stirring
oratory has more sway but
above all else, the faction with
the largest number of mindless
supporters will win the day.
If the Left Alliance feels it has
any support among the students
at IC, it must demonstrate this
by ensuring that a large number,
sufficient to outvote the Mines
delegation, appears at the next
U G M . Simon Rodan
