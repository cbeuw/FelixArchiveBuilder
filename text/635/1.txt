P O R N PARTY P R O V O K E S PROLIFIC PROTEST
'It makes me feel like a New man!' The anti-porn crusader holds
hands with a TV star outside Friday's review.
The controversial RSM Review
was picketed by over one hundred
members of WIST and various
college religious societies last
Friday.
Several other London colleges,
including the R C A and the
London School of Economics,
were represented on the picket
which was peaceful and not
intended to prevent people
entering the Review.
WIST had announced at their
preliminary meeting that they
were not concerned so much to
stop pornography generally, as
in Soho, but to stop it in IC.
They were worried that women
students would be put off from
joining IC, which is why WIST
put forward a motion in Tues-
day's U G M .
Some students were notice-
ably put off entering, and felt it
was necessary to enter the review
in large groups. N o police
attended the picket, but several
IC security guards were ob-
serving.
After the male strip-tease act,
the transvestite compere came
out to chat with some of the
protesters, including Michael
Newman. S/he considered that
the men who went into their
show of their own accord
enjoyed it just for the fun it was,
and so it was not capable of
stirring men to rape. S/he
claimed to see herself as a
mother figure to the strippers in
their everyday problems of
supporting family and children.

would close the meeting unless it
became more orderly. This
provoked more rowdiness until
the Miners shut up at a gesture
The motion on sexually explicit
events on Union premises was
heavily defeated at Tuesday's
UGM, largely because of several
hundred Miners who were there
specifically to vote against it.
After much discussion, it was
proposed that the motion on
sexually explicit events on Union
premises be voted on first.
Louise McKeown of WIST
stated, against cat-calls, that
pornography serves to divide
society in Imperial College.
Pornography is a mockery of
human sexuality, and to thus
degrade human beings was an
unhealthy form of amusement,
she said.
Nigel Walls, R S M U President,
replied that the motion was
against our rights, as intelligent

consenting adults, to what we
want to do. He saw the Review,
in particular, as good harmless
fun that wasn't meant to be
serious.
Summing up for the motion
Hugh Southey stated that events
like the Mines Review dis-
couraged women from attending
IC. He added that those com-
plaining about the poor male/
female ratio should do some-
thing about it and not support
events which ensured the num-
bers of women remained low.
After more dissension, Gaynor
Lewis of R S M also spoke against
the motion. At one point shouts
from the audience threatened to
drown out the speakers com-
pletely, whereupon the Chair-
man Nick Pyne announced he A gesticulatory Nigel Walls
I Friday, February 4,19831
from Nigel Walls.
The motion was defeated by
463 votes to 297.
Other items on the agenda
were dealt with more summarily.
The motion to ban all Imperial
College ties with South Africa,
was again met with heckling
from the Miners. David Hodes
stopped during the reading of his
motion, to say that he was trying
to exercise freedom of speech
rights that were denied to him in
South Africa.
A spokesman from R S M U
said it would take years to
investigate Imperial College's
connections with South Africa,
and that it would be 'pretty
stupid' to pass this motion,
although several Union mem-
bers felt that R S M had a vested
interest, as RSM depends heavily
on its contacts with South
Africa, and it probably employs
50% of R S M graduates.
Two votes had to be called
for, and the motion was defeated
by 264 votes to 233.
