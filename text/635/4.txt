Water Water
Everywhere....,
Dear Martin
| I have been disappointed (if
not surprised) by the reaction of
your correspondents and your-
self to the College Secretary's
directive on water usage. It
seems incredible that in a
college of such a strong scientific
and engineering these people
show so little understanding of
the problems, efforts being
concentrated in a campaign to
malign John Smith. I would like
to challenge the points raised in
last week's F E L I X .
The directive of John Smith,
to fill baths with cold water by
Sunday noon, was, as reported
in F E L I X , issued on Friday. The
appeals by the water authority
not to hoard water were not
broadcast till after this time, and
I myself recall none before
Monday morning. M r Smith
acted perfectly correctly.
Further criticisms of M r
Smith said the measures were
unnecessary and ineffective. I
am now reading for the MSc in
Engineering Hydrology (Water
Engineering) but my argument
does not require tiny vast hydrau-
lic understanding, rather CSE
physics would suffice. I am
surprised since most IC students
must have at least O Level
physics at the total misappre-
hension shown, even by you, the
wise old Editor of F E L I X . You
Wrote most profusely in a
'monumentally asinine' (sic) way
that we will suffer no harm
unless the Kensington/Chelsea
'and Westminster p u m p i n g
stations fail. Quite rightly you
stated "It's highly unlikely that
both of these will fail simul-
taneously" and the front page
article that a breakdown is
" u n l i k e l y unless the strike
continues for several weeks".
Pump failures are of minor,
relevance, the worry is of failed
water mains.
Let me spell this out in
' M i c k e y M o u s e ' style. The
supply of water to buildings and
high places is dependent on the
maintenace of pressure in the
distribution system. Burst pipes
release the pressure maintained
by pumping, so water will not
flow uphill to our roof tops and
tanks.
I am sure that the residents of
the top floors of Southisde,
Northisde and all other College
residences are well aware that
they are a long way above
ground, and that the water tanks •
are above their heads. It is
precisely these tall buildings
which will be affected first by a
pressure loss. The residents of
these buildings will lose their
supply (even if they do have O
level physics). Incidentally,
several burst mains have oc-
curred, one in Fulham Road.
I support Mr Smith's directive
and believe it shows a degree of
forethought not attained by the
correspondents, editor and
reporters of F E L I X .
With reference to the garbage
(as normal) scribbled by Paul
Simion (who gets a high quota of
mentions), the directive was that
the stored water is for flushing
toilets. M r Smith d i d not
(unfortunately) instruct you to
drink it Paul. We don't need
sterile water to flush our loos.
I am sure that such an im-
portant resident of Bernard
Sunley House can prevent his
co-habitants from dipping their
toes in the stored water; is
capable of finding a low lying
launderette and washing from a
sink. Further I'm sure that a
man of such authority and
cleanliness can wash a bath, but
as I said the cleanliness of the
water is unimportant.
Finally, window cleaners
don't use much water, certainly
less than a few bath fulls (and
who's been complaining about
dirty windows?) and I wasn't
aware many IC students bathed
very regularly anyway.
Yours odourlessly

PS: What a slagging M r Smith
would have had with no direc-
tive and no water!

Dear Martin
I must clarify the situation
concerning the proposed Bernard
Sunley House rent strike as
reported in your January 28
issue. Your article, although it
attempted to be objective, lacked
the accuracy that we have come
to expect from F E L I X . I think
this is due to your use of Paul
Simion as a major source. In fact
it was unwise to trust his version
of events as he has political
motives (ie his desire to be
elected U G M Chairman this
year). Your article lays the
blame quite firmly upon STOIC
whereas we both know that
STOIC reports, not incites, the
news.
On Saturday 22 M r Simion
told me that he was thinking of
organising a rent strike and
would he get STOIC coverage.
With an eye for a scoop I
H H S I M H H H M H February 4,1983
consulted my superiors who said
'cover it in case it happens'. On
Sunday the cameras took shots
of the outside of Bernard Sunley
and the offending interior. W E
are unable to get the wardens'
reaction because M r Simion
refused to tell him that he was
organising a rent strike in case
the Warden quoshed it. He then
called together a proportion of
the house committee who agreed
to withhold their rent until the
31st but were puzzled that Mr
Simion did not know how to
organise a rent strike despite his
desire to be seen as a man of the
people, fighting for the down-
trodden student. Apparently he
asked M r G o u l d e r how to
organise a rent strike but was
advised that as it would fail it
would be political suicide. So by
late on Tuesday night Mr Simion
pointed out to me that he had
never had anything to do with a
rent strike, had never heard of
one and never wanted to be
connected with one. On Wednes-
day STOIC was requested to
withhold the item on the grounds
that F E L I X had agreed not to
print it either (obviously a
figment of Simion's imagina-
tion). W E agreed on the grounds
that no strike equals no news.
The strangest thing is that
despite M r S i m i o n telling
STOIC, F E L I X and M r Goul-
der, he failed to inform the sub-
wardens, the warden: Nick
C a m p b e l l , or anyone from
C o l l e g e . The warden knew
nothing about it until questioned
by F E L I X and his reaction to
me when I told him what was
going on was that it was just an
attempt to further the political
career of a certain member of the
house.
M r Simion, the man who
requested that STOIC support
him in his campaign to be
President in 1985 (despite the
fact that we are constitutionally
forbidden to do so) then attacked
STOIC for sensationalism even
though we did not mention the
non-event until February 3 and
then only in our defence. He has
since attacked the idea of a rent
strike, his own idea. This begs
the question—is a man who
stands for one thing and then
falls in with the people he is
attacking a man suitable to hold
a Union office never mind the
seven committee seats that he is
rumoured to hold in I C U and
U L U . It will be a sad day for the
Union if M r Simion is elected
U G M Chairman or even Presi-
dent as he hopes. N o , M r
Simion, you are to blame—not
STOIC. The only thing that we
did wrong was to enter the house
without the Warden's permission
and he has accepted our apology.
What right have you to attack
such a popular and hard working
warden as Nick Campbell?
Yours objectively

Dear Sir
We feel obliged to correct
your article in last week's
F E L I X (no 634) about a sup-
posed rent strike in Bernard
Sunley H o u s e . Y o u stated,
incorrectly, that there are only
ten cooking rings to serve 108
people. In fact, M r Simion,
whom you quoted, was referring
to only one of the four kitchens
in the house. Only one bathroom
in the house is in the condition
that you described and this is
due for redecoration.
The members of the House
Committee who convened the
original meeting now realise that
their action was ill-advised and
regret that the whole matter got
out of hand. Bernard Sunley
House, in common with the
other student houses in Evelyn
Gardens, has a well-established
procedure for attending to
general repairs and maintenace.
We feel that this is able to cope
with any demands made upon it.
The House Committee wishes
to make it clear that rumours of
a rent strike in Bernard Sunley
House are unfounded.
Yours faithfully
Bernard Sunley House
Committee

Dear Editor
I am writing you in the hopes
that you could publish the article
following, to advertise a new
society which is just in the
process of getting officially
affilliated to Imperial College.
"Imperial College Brewing
Society is a new club, trying to
get officially recognised by IC
Union (already 20 members). Its
aims are to unite students
interested in brewing so we can
organise 'beer tasting evenings',
to enable members to compare
and comment on each others
brews. It is hoped, through a
Union grant, to purchase equip-
ment for the use of all members
for brewing at IC.
Any one interested please send
names and dept with any con-
structive comments to Eric
Barnaby, Civ Eng 1.
Yours faithfully
E Barnaby
I FELIX
