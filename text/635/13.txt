ISPORTI
The first team still in high spirits
after retaining first position in
the London Colleges League by
a slim two points ventured to
Parliament Hill last Saturday for
the UC'5'. Jon Lea (38)—was he
really wearing a brand new IC
vest—led the team home over
the testing course, still slightly
moist in places; actually like a
quagmire if you want to be
honest about it. Then the rabble
followed with team captain Jon
Frost (69) bringing up the rear as
ever. Nigel Fenwick (50) sneaked
in in front of Rob 'money man'
Morrison (52) and Graham T
was only taking it easy' Harker
(54). Dick Smith (61) was closely
followed in by Phil Parr-Burman
(63).
Disappointments for Tasso
Asteriades who dropped out
with back trouble again and
Steve Taylor who posed as a
photographer being unable to
run due to injuries. The club
needs a g o o d turn-out on
February 23 for the last L C L
race, so, see you there.
Volleyball
In this exciting episode of the
Spiker's Saga I have the pleasure
to present a new competition,
the score of last week's match, a
new high in volleyballing sar-
torial splendour, and an apology
of truly grovelling dimensions!
First the scores—last week the
jet-setting first team voyaged to
Watford and for the second time
this season beat the upstart
northerners, though for some
unaccountable reason we lost
the first set. Final score 6-15, 15-
3, 15-12, 15-2, exit Watford.
On the way up we held an
official Club Meeting, and this is
where the competition (nay,
challenge) comes in I C V B C
claims the record for holding an
Athletics Club General Meeting
in the most unusual place: the
back ot an ICU transit van doing
70mph up the M l . Any club who
thinks it can outdo that are
welcome to try. If they win, they
can buy us all a drink for being
the first.
Now folks, it's cringe time. In
my article of two weeks ago, I
put in an appeal for Greek-
speaking Barry Manilow fans to
contact one of our members.
Unfortunately I forgot to specify
that these poor people must be
exclusively female, and u n -
savoury conclusions appear to
have been drawn by certain
reactionary elements. Anyway, if
I gave offence or caused suffer-
ing, my humble apologies
Christos (please let go of my
arm), it was only meant as a
joke.
IC vs Kingston 59-78
On M o n d a y evening a well
d i s c i p l i n e d K i n g s t o n team
played us in a hard fought
match. At half time we were five
points behind with everything to
play for, but the beginning of the
second half saw us drop further
behind until eventually the task
was too much , and we lost 59-
78.
IC vs Ealing 70-62
The following night we travelled
out to Ealing with five players
to a match that had the prospect
of being a farce since they so
obviously outclassed us.
The final result may have been
a shock but it was certainly well
earned. Once settled our defence
was tight and throughout the
game patient build-ups saw our
score tick over nicely. Their
greater experience probably won
them the game.
IC2 vs BSOl 1-4
IC3 vs Bed C 0-5
IC4 vs City 2 3-2
Our first win this term! While I
hope there are many more like it,
it's difficult to envisage any great
successes for as long as I C
students continue to drop like
flies in the spring term wnen the
prospect of finals looms that bit
closer. Do other sports clubs
suffer similar selection problems?
On a lighter note, four mem-
bers saw seventeen-year-old
Sohail Quasir, Pakistan, btr.t
Greg Gurkin, Australia, 3 i ro
win the 3M British Open Squash
Championship at Wembley last
Friday, and learnt a thing or two
in the the process!
Paderborn Tourist Office
(Germany) have written and
have set one of their young
ladies to work on our behalf (!).
Meanwhile Newnham College,
Cambridge, thanked us for our
challenge but pointed out that
theirs was an all-female college!
1C vs UC 10-1
Here's another lengthy report to
fill out the space so that Chess
Club won't get a look in.
The IC machine rolled into
action against U C in the semi-
final of the K O Cup. Pre-match
training the previous evening by
two of the men proved its worth,
with exemplary performances by
y o u r resident t r a n s v e s t i t e
compere, Zombie Willis, and
male stripper on roller skates,
Ian 'who says you.can't play
whilst still drunk' Bull.
Huff Chrisslet and the club
nutter, Dominic, taunted the
opposition with a series of outer
Mongolian War chants, numer-
ous mishits and the occasional
burst of poetry.
On the other hand, the ladies
proved that soft toilet paper in
the ladies only can reap generous
rewards! They took U C ladies to
the cleaners in the Jaffa cake
eating contest, and just to rub it
in also outshone them at bad-
minton.
Anyway, to sum up, IC won
10-1, and this very strong team
goes on into the final.
Firsts
IC vs Borough Road 11-0
A smartly turned out (interview
suits predominant) IC 1st X V
arrived at Borough Road expect-
ing a hard game in one of our
top College fixtures. Two years'
previously we received a good
fifty points thrashing. However,
it was soon evident that our
team, especially the forwards,
were more than a match for our
opposition. The first half saw IC
always permanently entrenched
in the Borough Road 22. U n -
fortunately, due to some rather
hurried play, most of the good
possession was wasted and the
only score was a penalty by Paul
Barker. Fortunately, the second
half saw IC continue in good
form, dominating up front. In
scrum, line out and loose and
this was soon rewarded with an
excellent push-over try from a
five yard scrum, scored by Stuart
Johns. The backs stifled the
opposition effectively through-
out the game and showed their
o p p o r t u n i t y when A l a s t a i r
Davies broke a tackle to score in
the corner after good work from
the forwards. In the latter stages
of the game, the PE college's
fitness began to tell, but resolute
.defence kept them out.
Firsts
IC vs Thames Valley 6-0
An IC 1st X I playing with only
ten m e n , p u l l e d o f f a fine
lictory—largely attributable to
the team's international flavour.
Margaret Pencil (fried yam with
coconut) and Geoff Graces (leak
soup) scoring five of the six
goals.
Despite Graces opening up an
old sickle wound early on and
temporarily reducing IC to nine
men, the defence remained
relatively sound with keeper
Casey only suffering a mild
stroke instead of the usual heart
attack. A much relieved D
Roosevelt (the only member of
the team with a Blue Peter badge
for mouth-to-mouth resusci-
tation) was thus saved from
having to administer the kiss of
life for the fourth successive
week.
The highlight of the game
came when Casey was overcome
by an attack of spontaneous
laughter and collapsed in a heap
while saving a penalty flick.
Seconds
IC vs Amersham 1-0
It seemed a fruitless vi
One-nil down within a minute
Duncan had a tussle
With a man made of muscle
Nick had a chance, but did miss
it
Perhaps Amersham were ruthless
Anyway our attempts seemed
useless
But in the after-match raffle
Jim won a pineapple
So our visit proved not to be
fruitless
