Six Nations Round Up
Jonny Pratt and Tessa Davey give their verdict on the six teams with the Rugby World Cup in England just one year away.
ENGLAND
It’s far too easy to lament a bad bounce
of the ball or some poor last minute
defensive lapses and miss the bigger
picture. England, with aspirations of
a home Rugby World Cup success
in 2015, should have won a Grand
Slam. The vast majority of knockout
matches in the RWC are tight games,
so you have to be comfortable closing
them out. Some really impressive
performances besides the France
game leave them very much on the
way up.
IRELAND
What is it with Ireland and new
coaches? A really strong Six Nations
culminated in an intensely stressful
final match (for everyone who isn’t
Scotland or Italy). Schmidt might not
quite have brought ‘Leinstertainment’
to the team just yet, but they
looked very good throughout the
tournament. Their power game in the
mauls destroyed Wales, and ultimately
provided the points difference that
won the title.
SCOTLAND
To put it bluntly this was a terrible
tournament for Scotland, a one-
point win against Italy was one of a
few high points. Could and perhaps
should have beaten France on the
day, but sport is judged on absolutes.
Hopefully the arrival of Vern Cotter
will provide them with some fresh
impetus, though Scott Johnson has
done little to show why he should be
Director of Rugby. It’s hard to take
too much from the final game, since
the loss of a fullback that early is an
impossible position.
FRANCE
A fairly bad year for France; the team
never seemed to gel and we didn’t see
anywhere near enough flair. Their
wins against England and Scotland
could quite easily have gone the
other way, and Philippe Saint-André
needs to take a deep look at his team.
The attempt to blood Jules Plisson
was admirable, and it was certainly
interesting to see France pick a fly-
half at 10, but it never took off for the
young Parisian. Despite this they were
still in contention, and could continue
to spring surprises at the RWC.
ITALY
While this was the worst Six Nations
for Italy in a good few years there
were a lot of promising signs. Michele
Campagnaro seems quite an exciting
young player in the centres, and I
fully expect a number of teams to be
sounding him out for a potential move
this summer. The old stereotype that
when Parisse doesn’t perform neither
do Italy is sadly still true, and with
their captain out of sorts for the whole
tournament the Italians lacked their
supply of gain line busting runs. After
a few years of punching above their
weight Italy face a bit of a rebuilding
phase, but with the quality of young
players they have coming through
there’s real hope for the future.
WALES
It’s hard to get a real judge on Wales
this year, they seem to have lost their
edge from previous years, with the
spikiness of Mike Phillips going past
an acceptable point. Wales still have a
team with some fantastic players, but
it feels like the end of an era. Warren
Gatland needs to look at blooding
some younger players; otherwise
Wales could well be a long way behind
England and Australia in their RWC
pool.
