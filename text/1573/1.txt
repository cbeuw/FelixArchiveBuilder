Corrupt Regime Finally Ousted From
Office In Violent Revolution
West Basement - Beit Hall Following
fierce fighting Hangman has this
week finally wrested the control of
University newspaper production
from the corrupt, odious Editor-in-
Chief Joe ‘the bloodthirsty’ Letts.
Whilst information from the ground
is still sketchy at best, it appears that
our noble hero, Hangman, took the
opportunity to seize power from
the former regime following the
chaos caused by the West Basement
‘redevelopment’ (for a real look at
what this so-called redevelopment
really means, see Best Features).
Seized, however, does not do justice
to the selfless act Hangman has carried
out in ridding our Great University
from this editorial tyrant and his team
of yes-men section editors. It would
be more appropriate to view this as
the return of power, freedom and
voice to you, the student and reader.
The struggle, whilst relatively short,
caused indescribable carnage as well
as significant and regrettable collateral
damage. At approximately 3.45 am on
the 19th of March, Hangman and a
group of loyal supporters stormed the
Former Felix Office taking out several
key section editors (thought to be
the entirety of News and at least one
member of Comment). Fierce hand-
to-hand combat ensued and many
loyal Hangman supporters died for
the cause.
Slowly, however, the battle turned
in Hangman’s favour and upon seeing
the loss of his best lieutenant – Tessa
Davey – the cowardly Letts decided
to flee. In the confusion of battle, he
somehow managed to evade capture.
Latest rumours suggest he may now
be hiding within another corrupt
publishing regime – The Tab. In any
case, there is now a huge reward for
Letts’ capture, dead or alive (see
News).
Whilst in normal circumstances
Letts could have expected

reinforcements from both STOIC and
IC Radio, the sheer number of boxes
and old equipment prevented Master
of TV, Johnny ‘mad-axe’ Pratt and
Station Manager George ‘the butcher’
Butcher from coming to their old
crony’s aid.
It is said that once the news filtered
out to the general Imperial populace
there were woops of joy followed by
impromptu communal parties on all
floors of the library. The exceptions, of
course, were the silent sections which
remained sacredly soundless.
In statement to the press and
University as a whole, Hangman said
“this is an auspicious day in the history
of student publications at Imperial”
“We have a proud and noble
tradition of excellent publications
stretching back generations. From
the ashes of this putrid regime it shall
arise once more”.
In the interests of operating in a
transparent manner, Hangman also
distributed a separate press release
describing the changes to be made
to Imperial’s foremost publication.
Sources also confirmed that, whilst
Editor-elect, Philippa Skett, would
be allowed to continue next year, she
would only be in charge of day-to-day
running of the new publication in a
newly created role entitled ‘The Voice
of Hangman”.
It is thought that, despite these being
uncertain times for Imperial student
publications, so unpopular were the
previous regime that it is unlikely
that there would be any counter-
revolution. Justice for the many
victims of Letts and his underlings
cannot be finally served, however
until the man himself is made to pay
for his atrocities.
