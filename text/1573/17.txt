JPR WILLIAMS CUP
with a penalty. This was to be the story
of their day.
But this was not the case for the
medics. They were soon gaining
territory themselves in the College
half, and this time they made no
mistake. After numerous phases,
scrum half Andrew Barrie was able to
make a quick dash to the line, making
sure to place the ball under the posts.
Outside Centre OIiver Clough slotted
over the posts to put the medics into
an early 7-3 lead.
Soon the medics were pushing
again, but with no try in sight
Clough chose to take the points, and
nonchalantly dropkicked the ball
through the sticks to extend the lead
by 3 points. The boot of Clough was
to become something that the medics
could depend on during the course of
the game.
The next five minutes turned out
to be one of the few passages of play
in which the College dominated.
However, for all their determination
and effort, they were unable to score
the try that would have given them
the confidence that they needed to
really kick on and win the game.
After another medic infringement the
College chose to go for the points and
fly half James Cox took them gleefully
to pull the game back to 10-6.
This brief period could not provide
the College with much respite, and
soon they were again defending
deep into their own territory. Just
as it seemed as though the College
had defended their line admirably
and, more importantly, successfully,
Clough again showed great skill as
he kicked into the corner to force a
lineout on the five-metre line. This
was to prove very fruitful, as after
more phases of rugby the Medics were
able to push over the line. This time
it was in the form of former England
International Tom Rees, who was
playing for the medics at number 8.
As usual, Clough knocked over the
penalty; it was suddenly 17-6 with five
minutes to go until half time.
College could have been forgiven
at this stage if they were looking
forward to ten minutes of respite
in the dressing room, but before
that the medics had more plans. An
elementary catch was fluffed on the
half way line by the College to hand the
medics put in at the scrum with three
minutes to go. They kept pushing,
before finally being awarded a penalty
within kickable range. That human
metronome Clough took the chance
and with the last kick of the half took
the medics into a commanding 20-6
lead.
Any chance of a College comeback
took an early hit as Clough kicked a
drop goal over the posts within the
first two minutes of the second half
to extend the lead to a very healthy 17
points.
However, this didn’t stop the
College, who now entered another
period of domination. At one stage
it really looked as though this move
would not prevail, but captain
Michael O’Connell was determined
and it was him who went over the line
to score the College’s first and only try.
However, in a move that summed up a
wretched evening for the College, the
conversion was missed, leaving the
score at 23-11.
However, this was to be the last sniff
of scoring that the College had, as the
medics showed their superiority in the
last 20 minutes of the game. It was not
long before this pressure told on the
College, as the Medics went over to
put yet another 7 points on the board,
and in doing so extend the score to 30-
11.
By this stage it was clearly over for
the College, but there was still the
chance of restoring some pride by
making the scoreline seem closer.
But this was not to be, as the medics
kept applying pressure to the College
defence. The College eventually
succumbed to the pressure that the
medics were applying when wing
Chidi Nzekwue went over under the
posts to add another five points. As
usual, Oliver Clough slotted over to
take the lead to 37-11.
It was not long after this that the
whistle blew on what was a great
match with plenty of excitement.
Oliver Clough was the stand out
performer for the medics, with his
boot gaining them 17 points, as well
as a 100 percent kicking record.
But, for the College, it was a year of
dashed dreams and they returned to
the College knowing that if they are
to win back the JPR Williams Cup
next year it will need a much stronger
performance, as the medics really
showed their superiority and their
class in this fixture.
