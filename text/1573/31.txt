Maximilian Eggl, on another beautiful encounter with Bluetooth
August EP650 Headphones
A
lmost a year and a
half ago I stumbled
across the wonderful
world of Bluetooth
headphones. For those
of you who might remember, back
then a naïve tech writer I had just
decided to splash out on a pair of
20 quid headphones from Amazon,
namely the SX-907. To date this still
remains my most popular article,
and by which I assume that either
I am reading my own articles way
too much or that you guys are
genuinely interested about
Bluetooth headphones. For
my own sanity, I shall
assume the latter.
However my babies
could only last so
long before going
through some
u n f o r t u n a t e
accident, I
managed to
snap them (if
you really
want to
know, I sat
on them).
This event
f o r c e d
me to
make yet
a n o t h e r
purchase,
a similar
pair to the
ones I had
bought for
my virgin
experience.
A bit more
e x p e n s i v e ,
t h e s e
headphones by
the 7dayshop
were quite
s a t i s f a c t o r y .
However, the
cheap plastic of the
material, coupled
with the strange
charger as well as the
covering of the earpiece
always falling off, kept
me from making rave
reviews. However I had
paid for these puppies, so
I was not going to buy a new
pair until these guys gave up.
Luckily enough for me, they
did just that two weeks ago
(under somewhat suspicious
circumstances I must divulge). This
gave me the opportunity of once
again perusing the wonders of that
store in the sky, namely Amazon.
Given recent circumstances, I was
feeling quite down in the dumps
and decided to splash out. I went
way above my initial spending limit,
and in the end purchased the August
EP650 Bluetooth headphones for a
whopping £35. Given that previously
I had spent a maximum of 25 quids,
this was actually quite an increase.
However the reviews and 4.5 star
rating on amazon,
as well as
the
general
a w e s o m e
look finally
gave me that final
adrenaline rush I needed
to click the purchase button.
The next day, my brand new
headphones appeared at my
doorstep. Given I had lived the
past week without headphones, I
was really excited at what was to
come. When I had gotten my other
two headphones, I had been quite
disappointed by the cheap look of the
packaging, however for the EP650
I was very pleasantly surprised.
Everything looked very clean, and
to be quite frank, rather expensive.
Furthermore inside the box there
was even a manual!
Imagine that.
Given that
Blue to oth
headphones
are slightly more difficult configure
than general headphones, I found
this to be quite a boon that I had
experienced with my purchases.
Before I actually talk about
the headphones, I would like to
commend August for their colour
choices for the headphones. For the
cheap headphones, you usually have
one colour to choose from and even
on the expensive ones it usually is
rare to have more than three colours.
Here we have 5 distinct
c o l o u r s
( a l t h o u g h
silver and white
do look quite
similar). I went for
the blue, as that is quite
an unusual and interesting
colour for headphones, and I
do not regret my choice. All in
all, the ability to somewhat make
these headphones your own is
major plus point in my book.
Now back to the goods. A little
summary of the specs: These guys are
Bluetooth headphones, meaning they
will be able to connect to anything
that has Bluetooth capabilities.
Furthermore it has a 3.5 standard
audio socket (they supply the wire as
well!), which means that the EP650
can be used when out of battery,
as well as with devices that
do not support
B l u e t o o t h .
Furthermore,
the fact that you use a micro USB
to charge these puppies, makes a
welcome change from the strange
formats of my other headphones.
The first impression of the
headphones was really positive. The
glossy finish and design offset the use
of plastic, and make these puppies
look much more expensive than they
actually are. Given that headphones
in general are quite large and visible,
this is a plus point! Furthermore after
a bit of testing, it turned out that the
EP650 was quite flexible, making
for a comfortable fit on my quite
big head. Lastly, in terms of design,
these guys were quite light and the
fact that you could fold them up
makes them quite portable,
meaning they actually
fit in my jacket pocket!
Now to the most
important part of this
review: the audio.
Given that with
all my previous
purchases I had
very positive
experiences,
I didn’t think
I could be
impressed.
I couldn’t
have been
m o r e
w r o n g .
Connecting
the EP650
to my
phone was
i n c r e d i b l y
easy, and it
even showed
a little battery
icon to show
how charged my
headphones were!
The headphones
were fully charged,
and so I was ready to go.
Good hint btw: If you are
testing new headphones, try
Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen.
It goes all the way from low bass
to high vocals, fully testing the
audio equipment you are thinking
of buying. Anyway, the moment the
vocals of Freddie Mercury blasted
into my ears, I knew immediately I
had bought a gorgeous pair. The bass
was full and rounded, resonating my
ear. The highs were crisp and clean.
The sound was gorgeous and exactly
what I needed. Later on I tried the
EP650 with other genres of music
as well and they held up remarkable
well. Every song I threw at these
headphones was played back in an
admirable quality. Furthermore,
when I compared these guys to
£200 Beats, my 35 pound Augusts
were almost on par. I am serious, I
would have paid double for these
headphones, given the quality I was
getting. Also, when I plugged these
guys in using the standard jack, the
quality was just as good/bad as with
the Bluetooth, meaning you don’t lose
any quality regarding the connection
medium you decide to use.
In terms of battery, I found that the
EP650 performed admirably in my
every day life, and I found that even
after three days I still did not need to
charge these guys. Also considering
that these headphones only take
about 2-3 hours to charge, I don’t
think you really need to worry about
that. Also, the worst case scenario
you always have the audio jack, right?
All in all I am mighty pleased
with these headphones, however
there is one caveat. This could be
something that only applies to me,
but even though the EP650s use soft
material and sit very comfortably,
after a while of use my ears would
start feeling really hot as well as
hurting. Thus after 2 or 3 hours I
found that I needed to take them
off and just rest my ears a bit.
For 35 pounds I have gotten one of
the best deals of my life. The sturdy
design means that these guys should
survive quite a while (as long as I
don’t sit on them). Furthermore, the
quality of the audio as well as the
beauty of the EP650 really, really
belong to Bluetooth headphones
doubles if not triples their price.
So if you in the market for a pair of
headphones, before checking out
the overpriced brand names, have
a look at the August EP650. Trust
me, you won’t be disappointed!
I am serious, I would
have paid double for
these headphones,
given the quality I
was getting.
