FOOTBALL / NETBALL / RUGBY
It was a beautiful sunny day, the
pitches at Harlington looked the best
they have ever done. The stage was set
for a wonderful afternoon of football.
The trip over was, however, ruined by
the news that the 3rd team goalkeeper
had pulled out and therefore through
standard hierarchical process our
goalkeeper had to play for the 3s. Our
regular goalkeeper had phoned in sick
the previous night but bravely agreed
to power through the pain and make
his way over to West London. Sean
did not arrive until after kick-off so
substitute Liam had to stand in for him
for about ten minutes. It was a great
effort from Liam, not letting a goal in.
A dishevelled Sean took his spot in the
goal and immediately had to make one
of his hallmark great saves.
With the full team on the pitch
and the status quo restored, the team
could now properly focus on the task
at hand. At the pre-match meeting
it was proposed that we play a half-
pitch press, a strategy meaning we
would defend very deep in our own
half. This is entirely reliant on good
discipline from everyone, especially
the mid-fielders who must track back
as soon as they loose possession. From
the start of the game it was clear that
the opposition would play the way we
thought they would. They dominated
possession. It was a matter of making
sure they didn’t make anything from
it. The first half showed perfect
execution of that game plan, as they
were completely unable to create any

real chances.
The second half was much the same
and it was clear the opposition were
getting frustrated and tired. It was now
the time for us to seize our chances on
the counter attacks, notably down the
wings as Hugo made great runs with
the ball into their penalty box. He
should have been awarded a penalty
after being clipped in the back of the
legs without falling over. The referee
can be quoted as saying “If he had
gone down then I would have given it”.
Anotherinexplicabledecisionfromthe
referee came in the 85th minute when
the opposition centre-back displayed
a despicable piece of unsportsmanlike
conduct. He deliberately hand-balled
at the half way line, hence preventing
our rapid striker Will from getting
to the ball and having a one-on-one
with their keeper. The fact that the
referee stopped play even though the
advantage could have been played as
Will could have made it, but didn’t
send off or even book the culprit, is
beyond belief.
It was 0-0 at the close, overall a
great result against all the odds. To
put things into context, this is a team
that is four leagues above us, and also
top of their division. This performance
was a great showing of the willpower
and discipline of the team and one we
can all be proud of and that needs to
spur us on in the upcoming UH Cup
semi-final. A special mention to Hugo
for his input at the team meeting as
our tactics proved to be successful.
Another mention to James who broke
his toe near the end of the game,
Sean our goalie, Stephen our man
of the match and lastly to Harry for
supporting us on the side-lines while
he recovers from injury.
IC 2nd XI swatted aside a shambolic
Medic ‘football’ team, who probably
would have preferred to spend their
day enjoying the sunshine instead of
picking the ball out of their net. Whilst
we would love to divulge and expand
on this simple victory, it really isn’t
worth our time. We hope that next
year the medics can put up a fight, or
at least improve their abysmal chat; “I

witty quip from their number 10, who
incidentally missed a penalty with
probably his only touch of the game.
Better luck next year boys.

Varsity day finally arrived in the form
of a sunny afternoon ideal for the 7s
match ahead. The medics had a point
to prove, having lost last year to IC for
the first time in recent memory.
During the opening phases of the
game, both teams were well matched
with solid defence from both sides,
and neither team looking to threaten.
After retaining possession and
recycling well, Medics drew first
blood when Kath Fok handed off the
opposition in midfield from the 22
to run in the try under the posts and
complete the resulting conversion.
The medics edged towards the line
again, with Sarah Burns carrying
the ball from around the breakdown
towards IC’s try line. Charlie Stephens
cut back inside and crashed through
two tackles from the 5m line to score
the Medic’s second under the posts.
At half time, Medics were ahead 14-0.
IC were strong in the scrum and
hooker Lana Lee managed to steal
possession on the medics’ put in.
However, Lizzie Robison put in several
good tackles which led to a turnover
just inside the Medics’ half. Kath Fok
drew in two of the opposition off the
back of a scrum. Wakana Teranaka
ran a dummy line which fooled IC’s
last man allowing the ball to go wide
to Sammy for the Medic’s 3rd try.
Reacting well to a loose ball from
the Medics’ line out and drawing
several tackles, IC then went wide.
Alice Liberman sprinted down the
touchline, just evading her nearest
defender. Spinning back inside, she
dodged two further cover tackles to
score by the corner flag. Unable to
make the conversion, IC were coming
back, with the score standing at 21-5.
But the medics responded, making
their way again into the IC’s half.
Ran Xiong was always in support to
ruck over and retain possession. Ellie
Stewart sent a quick ball out from the
ruck which allowed Sammy Gottardi
to use her pace and run wide around
the shaken IC defensive line.
IC were to have the last score,
taking advantage of their extra subs.
The Medics were outnumbered and
fatigue was setting in when IC’s Pip
Heggie ran through at pace, and drew
in three Medic defenders to make the
tackle. From there, IC quickly went
wide again to send Clara Gago over
for the final try.
Still, Medics put in a great
performance to reclaim the Varsity
victory. Final score 26-10.

IC5s had an incredible start to the
match. During the first quarter, all
centre passes were carefully turned
into goals and successive rebounds
were secured by our GK Madina
Wane.
With the ball being down at our
attacking third for 90% of the time
and some lovely movement between
Amy West and Sarah Howarth, IC
heroically wrapped up the first fifteen
minutes with a 7 goal advantage at 11-
4.
It didn’t take the medics long before
they were fully alerted; they were in
their defensive mode as soon as the
timer started ticking again. The goal
difference was quickly reduced down
to 4 after their aggressive fight back

and tactical change of players. Their
spectators were cheering louder than
before every time their shooters send
the ball through the hoop and our
hearts sank even further.
With panic and fear hovering over
our team, the ball was going down our
end at very fast pace and was turned
over repeatedly. The uprising pressure
has also unfortunately reduced our
shooting accuracy. We were overtaken
at the final quarter and were not able
to turn the table around. The final
score was 20-28 to ICSM.
It was a great match despite victory
not being on our side. Our score in the
first quarter was the highest on record
and our girls have performed at a very
high standard – credit to everyone’s
110% effort! It’s a shame that the game
isn’t only 15 minutes long!
Man of the match goes to Sarah
Howarth.
IC 4s went into varsity knowing that
the effort we put in terms of extra
training sessions would give us a
chance of doing well, however we
were unfamiliar with the standard
of the medic 4s and they were better
than anticipated. We put our all into
the game, but despite our efforts, the
medic shooters were on great form
and the game ended 39-14 to the
medics. Our man of the match was
Rach Shuttleworth who played GK.
In terms of what went wrong I think
that our constantly changing team
formation due to players moving

IC 4s defeated
comfortably by Medics
up to the 3rd team, dropping out
or not being able to play varsity for
various reasons meant that some of
our players had only played together
a few times, and the team had never
all played together in a competitive
match situation. Another definite
reason for our defeat was that not
enough matches are scheduled for the
4s in our BUCS league; we only started
out with 5 teams in the league and two
dropped out throughout the season.
Considering the number of changes
in our team throughout the netball
year, I think we played as well as we
could have. We managed 7 more goals
than last year and I’m sure the 4s will
continue to improve in the future!
