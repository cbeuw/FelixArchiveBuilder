Frankly, No One Gives A
Toss About University Sport
L
et[t]s not beat around the
bush any longer. If you’ve
come here looking for the
usual team sport reports
then you have made a serious
mistake. Not so much that you have
found the wrong place, this is indeed,
where they normally are. The problem
lies in the fact that your life has come
to this. You are, presumably, so bored
that you’d read any old rubbish about
something that truly does not matter.
Indeed, not only does no one outside
the immediate team give a fuck about
university sport, but it seems crazy to
even have a section dedicated to pages
and pages of the stuff.
Sure, partake in all the sports you want
and by all means, enjoy it. But let[t]
s just stop pretending that the match
reports from these things are even
worth the ink they’re printed with.
Oh yeah, great you travelled to
[unknown university] and gave
them a good thrashing/a stout game
congratulations. Please, please, please
never talk about it again, especially
not in a public space like a student
newspaper.
I mean, it’s not like there exist anyone
beyond the immediate team that
even has the remotest emotional
investment in how that team
performs in one of the many, equally
unimportant competitions available
to student sports teams.
Go ahead, accuse me of glory-hunting,
but I don’t think I’m alone in not giving
a flying fuck how the football 5th team
did in the competition where half the
teams didn’t turn up and the other half
forgot to bring their kits.
However, even this could be tolerable
if the teams didn’t presumably
hire illiterate primates to write the
reports for them. They are often so
unintelligible as to represent little
more than the random arrangement
of letters on a page.
Indeed, it is impossible to rule
out the concept that all the match
reports are randomly generated by
some computer deep in caverns of
Ethos that produces endless strings
of meaningless platitudes about how
everyone was contributing to the
team effort despite the spirit-crashing
thrashing the team has received.
None of this is helped by the fact that
Premier League
Predictions
Saturday
Chelsea v Arsenal
These two teams have both
done well so far with their players.
However, there is good reason to
suspect that these players aren’t
quite the players they were when
they last played. It’ll be a close one
but since whoever normally writes
this is a Chelsea fan, I’ll have to go
for them. Prediction: 4-0
Cardiff v Liverpool
Both of these sides play in red so
that could be a problem unless one
side manages to dye their shirts in
which case we should be fine. The
15:00 kick will probably favour
Liverpool as they have the better
team. Prediction: 2-7
Everton v Swansea
Everton and Swansea, now there
are two teams that play a lot of
football. Roberto Martinez, a man
who’s managed a lot of teams.
Garry Monk, not so many. It’s all
pointing towards an Everton win,
but in this unpredictable Universe
it would be foolish to rule out any
scenario. Prediction: 5-6 AET
(Swansea to win in extra-time
multi-ball)
Hull v West Brom
Yet another two sides playing in
the Barclays Premier League this
weekend and both desperately
need as many points as possible
(as per the rules). Hull it has
transpired recently are liable to be
head-butted at any moment, which
in normal circumstances would
be a disadvantage but, perversely,
can be an advantage in football.
It would be the height of the
arrogance to dare predict the result
of this one. Prediction: 2-1
Man City v Fulham
Die Miester. Die Besten. Les
Grands Equipes. The main event.
Yes, neither of these teams is in
the Champions League which is
the main reason why they’re both
playing one another in a match
that it is already being dubbed as
“ON” this weekend. Man City have
literally all the good players but
also Martin Demichellis for some
reason. This should give Fulham
eternal hope and I fully expect
them to come away with all three
points this weekend. Prediction:
1-3
Newcastle v Crystal Palace
This match essentially boils down
Hangman
Editor-in-Chief
to France vs A Team Of Players
Barely Anyone Has Heard Off and
such is thought to be likely to be very
close. France have already managed
to secure qualification for the World
Cup this summer so are unlikely
to be particularly interested in the
result. Crystal Palace, however, have
it all to do if they are to feature in
Brazil in June. Expect big things
from Marouane Chamakh for some
reason, most probably because he’ll
be schamakhing them in. Prediction:
3-6
Norwich v Sunderland
Is there anything about this
Norwich v Sunderland match
that hasn’t already been written?
I doubt it, but I’m bravely forging
on regardless. Gus Poyet, as is his
want, will probably work himself
into such a rage that he will just have
to rip his jacket it off and throw it
as Wes Brown [West Brom?]. Chris
Hughton, however, is just lucky
to have a jacket at all as a nice one
is quite hard to find in Norwich.
Regardless, everyone on all sides
will be rooting for Fabio Borini to do
alright. Prediction: 3-3 (Sunderland
to go through on Away Goals).
West Ham Utd v Man Utd
No one can claim that these are not
United, especially in their mutual
desire to play a “rocking, locking and
popping” game of football to quote
young Man Utd fan, David Moyes.
It’s hard to see past West Ham
and their front three of Downing,
Nolan and Carroll but that’s mainly
because Andy Carroll’s exceptionally
tall and wide like a double-decker
bus. Prediction: 1-1
Sunday
Tottenham v Southampton
Two teams that play beautiful
football and Tottenham will battle
this one out. Spurs are now very
close to being able to drop all their
summer signings in a last ditch
attempt to revert to Gareth Bale.
However, instinct tells me they won’t
manage it this week and Saints with
their better team and better manager
will see this one out comfortably.
Prediction: 0-5
Aston Villa v Stoke
Infamous grudge match which
neither team will want to lose,
although you’ve got to hope that
neither go into a match wanting
to lose. Since both sides are the
epitome of average I’m going to have
to assume Stoke will win by a Peter
Crouch dirty goal and Johnathon
Walters non-penalty to a Fabian
Delph 100yard screamer. Prediction:
1-2
the editing process seems to consist of
several rounds of concentration of the
text to reach the impenetrable levels
with which we find them.
It then seems that the only logical way
to present the texts is with no images
whatsoever as, presumably, images
would be highly distracting for the
sort of idiots who grab a copy of the
newspaper only to read the reports of
the 5th lacrosse team.
To conclude, if you did come here
looking for the latest updates on how
the water polo side got on then you are
either in the side (in which case you
should probably remember) or you’re
temporarily out of the side, in which
case you can probably ask any number
of your obnoxious friends what the
score was if you are still somehow
possessed with a burning desire to
acquire useless facts.
Thankfully, the Hangman revolution
will put a stop to this bullshit and will
only occasionally include important
sport and very, very rarely include
Imperial sports teams and even then
only when they’ve one something
extremely important like the World
Cup or the Ashes.
Hangman describes the overall antipathy of all students towards
all university level sports.
