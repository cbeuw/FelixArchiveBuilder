A
first year Imperial
computing student
has taken the second
place prize at this
year’s Cyber Security
Challenge. Luke Granger-Brown was
one of 42 finalists taking part in the
final round of the competition – the
Cyber Security Masterclass, this year
taking place in the old Cabinet War
Rooms. The competition was founded
in 2010 as a collaboration between
the UK government and several
prominent companies, including
the defence contractor QinetiQ. The
competition is open primarily to
amateurs and aims to encourage more
people to develop the skills necessary
to join the computer security industry
in the face of increasing threats to our
computer networks.
Speaking to Felix Luke expressed
his belief that “cyber-security is
very important – computing is an
unavoidable part of our everyday lives
now, and it’s down to everyone to play
their part in keeping data secure”.
However, the general public remains
widely ignorant of how important it is.
“More than a few data breaches,” Luke
added, “could’ve been avoided if the
same old advice had been followed:
don’t click links in emails (especially
‘your account has been locked’ or
‘your password has been changed’);
don’t download attachments you
weren’t expecting or from people
you don’t recognise; run up-to-date
antivirus software.”
The lack of prominence of the field
has resulted in a chronic shortage
of people wanting to work in the
cyber security. While Luke first got
interested in computing as a result
of family connections many other
people who would thrive in the area
simply do not realise that they have
the abilities to do so. Speaking to
Wired magazine the Challenge CEO,
Stephanie Damen, said: “There are a
lot of people out there with the skills,
but for a lot of reasons, partly because
we didn’t teach it in schools, partly
because they’re unaware of the talent,
it’s hidden talent. We know there’s
talent, the problem is finding it.”
The aim of the Challenge is to bring
out this talent and put those who
have it in touch with those who can
help them develop it further. Luke,
in particular, believes that “it’s a great
way to meet people with a similar
interest, as well as to learn more about
the policy side of things, and talk to
sponsors in the industry about what
it’s like to work in cyber-security”.
The Challenge presents a diverse
range of tasks to the competitors.
Luke says: “There are three rounds to
the main competition – first a virtual
round, that’s entirely online. If you
manage to get through that, then
there’s a face-to-face round, which is
slightly more exciting. Passing that
gets you through to the Msterclass,
which is the most thrilling part.
Usually the Masterclass is in teams
made up of people who qualified from
different ‘streams; ‘i.e. different face-
to-face rounds) to make sure there’s a
diverse range of skill sets available in
each team.
The best part is almost certainly
the networking opportunities
the Challenge provides - they’re
unparalleled and a great way to talk
to sponsors! The prizes are good too,
though - training courses and exams
that would cost far too much for me
to afford on my own. The Masterclass
competition itself was also really
amazing – a simulated scenario of a
cyber-attack on Britain which had all
sorts of different aspects– network
traffic analysis, speaking to the press
and a mock board, writing up reports
(both technical and non-technical),
reverse engineering malware, creating
cleanup solutions for malware and
penetration testing.”
The competition’s organisers hope
that the Cyber Security Challenge
encourages more people to pursue
work in this field. As Luke says: “it’s a
big world out there and attackers are
only getting smarter and a wider range
of potential adversaries are appearing:
we need better and better ways to
protect ourselves.”
Imperial Student Success in
Cyber Security Challenge

questions are directly answered, with
Georgiadisdivertingtheconversation
to a discussion about democracy
or the ethos of the audience,
and its political background,
often dismissing participants of
the discussion as communists.
Brief moments of discussion are
interrupted by commotion during
which the Minister and the audience
exchange insults.
Notable remarks and questions
from the audience include the finds
discussed in papers in The Lancet,
a peer reviewed medical journal,
which the Prime Minister dismisses
as “Opinions not Facts”, in particularl
pointing out that the suicide and
vaccination numbers they cite are
wrong. He also compares the Greek
crisis to the 1945-6 British crisis
that led to the creation of the NHS
– a remark which is unfortunately
coupled with a comment on illegal
immigrants. Asked about suggestions
to allow greater freedom of drug sales
at lower prices by opening up the
pharmacist profession, the Health
Minister replies that such a policy
cannot be implemented in Greece
as the country has one of the highest
numbers of pharmacies per capita.
He says such measures would result
in half of them going out of business.
He is then asked about the incident
surrounding the drowning of
migrants off the coast of Farmakonisi
and his statements on it in Greek
parliament. Georgiadis is specifically
asked what is the value of a human
life – is the life of an immigrant less
valuable than that of a Greek national
and whether that will be mirrored
in his reforms. The Minister makes
some comments on immigration and
talks about how Greece has hit its
limit, as well as accusing the inquirer
of sneakily taking his statements
out of context. However, the
conversation is swiftly derailed, with
the Minister eventually calling the
crowd communist and commenting
on Stalin’s policies.
When a doctor from the audience
accuses him of being the first
Health Minister in history to target
particular ethnic groups, as well
as criticising the government for
disregarding scientific facts and
producing a climate of fear of
censorship among the academic
community, the conversation is
derailed into an argument over
semantics of what is a fact and what
is an opinion. Regarding measures
to tackle the humanitarian crisis in
Greece, all the Minister states is that
he is awaiting studies and data to find
a solution and that hew will propose
measures by June.
The discussion is nearing its
end. Throughout, there have been
eruptions of commotion. Even the
panelists seem to have lost their
patience, not only with the audience
but also with the Minister – who is
engaging in a game of verbal tag and
seems to try his best to challenge the
crowd. When a young man makes a
comment on the Health Minister’s
English, Georgiadis starts shouting
“You are racist! You are racist! You are
a fascist!” – apparently in mockery of
his opposers in the audience.
The last person from the audience
to speak is the young woman that was
invited to speak up first. She proceeds
to talk about her personal experience
with a young girl with HIV in the
Koridalos prison in Athens. She
criticises the reintroduction of the
regulation that requires mandatory
STI testing of socially vulnerable
groups such as sex workers, drug
users and illegal immigrants. She
gets emotional half way through. The
Health Minister, outraged, attacks
her for showing emotion and accuses
her of manipulating the crowd: “Like
you’re the only (one that’s) human!
You should be ashamed! You’re the
monster”.
The Discussion is closed after this.
The crowd has been getting smaller
throughout the event and with this
outburst a large part of the crowd
gets up and leaves. In the front, the
supporters of the Health Minister are
applauding him. Georgiadis delivers
his closing speech. It carries some of
the most absurd statements I have
heard all night: “These people are in
our universities, they’re everywhere,
they speak of democracy but don’t
let anyone that disagrees speak…We
have to show them that we are not
afraid of them. We are not afraid of
them. We represent the free world
… They make up the tyranny of the
world… ” He goes on to talk about
the difficulty of being a politician
in Greece, “…You have to be proud
of these politicians that have the
courage to stand up to the people”
and reverts to attacking the ethos
of the crowd that opposed him “…
Whenever they [communists] took
power they killed millions of people
… they will see all the people in
Greece die but for them this will be
nothing, because they will watch the
TV and eat their burger … You did
not let us do this conversation and
this is fascism … Today’s event was a
great event … The Greek politicians
are not doing things they’ve ashamed
of … We will not let our country fall
because some communists want to.”
Indeed the whole event was a
great success for Georgiadis. He
successfully evaded important
questions on future reforms of the
Health System by manipulating
and challenging the audience into a
verbal fight.
Ironically he kept going on about
democracy, how the people had
elected him, how he represents the
will of the people and how opposing
him meant opposing them. He kept
repeating the same argument and I
have to say, it got me thinking. We
did vote for him. Democracy did
get him where he is. Is not a system
that results in such people acquiring
political power flawed? Is this a result
of the tyranny of the majority? Or is
it just a mind game that politicians
play with us to make us believe that
yes, democracy is indeed flawed,
when in fact what we have is not
democracy. Perhaps it is the coupling
of democracy with capitalism that is
problematic, I don’t know. All I know
is that we need change.
