NETBALL / RESULTS
The IC Netball 2nd VII had given
up many lie-ins for extra trainings
on Sundays and fitness sessions on
Friday mornings, and all to prepare
for one day: Varsity 2014. The 2’s
Varsity netball match has been closely
contested for the past two years with
both sides having one win and one
loss under their belts. As the big day
approached we talked about dreams
and nightmares centred around our
medic rivals. Some may say we were
obsessed. We had always known that
IC 2s, who had been disgustingly
labelled as Imperial 4th in BUCS due
to the merge with the medics, should
instead be Imperial 3rds; but knew
we’d have to take the higher ground
and prove, once and for all, that we
did deserve to be above the medics.
March 12th was the day where we
could prove our worth, and that’s just
what we did…
The night before Varsity, IC 2s
bonded while decorating 110 cupcakes
and the team shovelled in the carbs via
mounds of pasta and raw cake mix. As
the next morning came and went, IC
2s were gradually losing their voices
due to the tense matches prior to the
2s (congrats IC 3s!). To save our much
needed vocals, we ventured onto
Princes Gardens to take in some fresh
air, warm up and calm our nerves
under the sun. Some last minute
tactics and a pre-game pep talk in the
Ethos foyer and before we knew it, we
were on court and ready for the first
whistle. Little did we know that our
dreams were about to be turned to
reality and nightmares forgotten!
With nerves to blame, the first
quarter was drenched with silly
mistakes for IC and a lack of
communication on court, finishing 8-3
to the medics. With the familiarity of
often finding ourselves behind early on
in matches, we were unphased by the
score line and regrouped. IC needed
to talk to each other and do what we
had done so well in our past games:
shower each other with compliments.
A particular favourite of the team has
always been “nice arms” and there was
no shortage of those two little words
in the rest of the game.
Clearly IC 2s love the compliments,
and quick turnovers at the start of
the second quarter ensured we took
an early lead. Rachael Collins made
incredible interceptions, coming out
of nowhere to take the ball right out
of medic hands (sometimes literally)
whilst the entire team were able to
work it down the court with a sense of
serenity. Izzy McLachlan and Harriet
Rumgay worked it around the D and
into the net seamlessly, ignoring the
copious amounts of contact not being
blown up; this calm approach to IC’s
game put us ahead and with four
minutes to go in the 2nd quarter the
score was 13-10.
Feeling a lot more positive about
the match, IC 2s still needed to be at
their best. Knowing that they’d been
comfortably leading at this point last
year and went on to lose (only just!),
the 2s knew the medics would come
back fighting. IC fought for every ball
and did so harder than the medics.
Our rivals got increasingly frustrated
with themselves and at IC’s beloved
umpire, Pat, causing play to be
advanced to the centre circle from our
defensive third, and within five passes
another turnover for IC resulted.
“Nice arms” from both shooters and
Emily Rolfe meant IC intercepted
passes like there was no tomorrow,
whilst at the other end, Toni
Semmence and Emma Dixon were
winning many rebounds and making
numerous interceptions. Shouts of
“BASELINE, BASELINE” could still
be heard over the crowd at the other
end of the court. Often considered the
‘safe’ pass out to players on the edge
of the D will no longer be seen in the
same light as Rachael consistently
leapt into the air, tipping the ball out
of the court, without touching a single
medic in sight.
Having extended our lead
considerably in the 3rd quarter to
32-16, our positivity was at an all-
time high and the compliments were
unstoppable. This was our game to
lose. But that was never going to
happen…
Like a great white we were released
into our ocean, the last quarter, where
we were free to tear our victims apart
College 2s beat Medics 42-35 in tense
and close encounter
with every turnover. Screams howled
from the medic spectators while IC
kept up their great work and beautiful,
beautiful arms. With even stronger
passes from the IC attacking end and
increased frustration by the medic
defence, Pat continued to stand her
ground. Someone should’ve told the
medics that nobody talks back to Pat
but she gently let them know that she,
indeed, was the umpire. Better late
than never!
A slightly dodgy baseline pass from
Sarah Simmonds which bounced off
the rim of the goal post was ripped
from medic hands by Harriet Rumgay
and summed up the whole afternoon’s
affair; IC will give false hope to those
weak enough to get carried away, and
then snatch it out of their hands in
broad daylight (or in this case, under
the bright lights of Ethos). It was
destined to be the biggest win IC has
had over the medics in a very long
time, and that’s just what it ended up
being. The final score of the match
was 42-35 and player of the match
was awarded to Harriet Rumgay for
her shooting and rebounds (as well
as compliments). But it was most
certainly a team effort, with every
rebound, pass and interception being
converted almost instantly. The
champagne may have only lasted a
few minutes, but the day will go down
in IC Netball history and is a day we
won’t let the medics forget.
We would like to send our
condolences to those who actually
believed the medic 2s could match IC’s
performance in this game, it’s always
hard letting go. We would also like to
make you aware that, though it may
not yet be official, there are rumours
that a 17 goal difference proves that
IC 2s (currently Imperial 4th) should
strip the medics of their “Imperial
3rd” BUCS title. RIP “Imperial 3rd
(Medics)”. You will be forgotten.
