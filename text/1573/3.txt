“Keep the
Cat Free”
L
ast Sunday the College was
visited by Adonis Georgiadis,
the Greek Health Minister.
The event – organised by the
Imperial College Hellenic
Society and held in the Clore Lecture
Theatre – both from College and
outside. One Imperial student gives
his perspective:
On Sunday, Adonis Georgiadis was
invited to Imperial College London to
discuss the Greek crisis and how the
country can move forward. The event
was supported by the LSE Hellenic
Society, the IC European Union
Society, the IC Economics Society,
Promote Greece and Omikron
Greece. I’ve been waiting for this
all week, unsure of what to expect
from both the crowd and the guests.
I’m in the lecture theater waiting
for the talk to start, pen and paper in
hand. The atmosphere feels heavy but
maybe that’s just me. The audience
is comprised of men and women of
various ages – from the snippets of
conversation I pick up they’re mostly
Greek.
The Health Minister is 20 minutes
late – at this point a group of people
hand out a declaration composed by
Greek Imperial Students and Staff
against the invitation of Georgiadis
to Imperial. As time goes by, people
get more excited, more tense.
Conversation gets louder. Someone
from the crowd asks how long we’ll
be waiting for, one of the organizers
replies that he’ll be here at 17:30.
“You should have told us, we’re busy
people. We’re not all Ministers”. The
heckling has begun.
The minister walks in more than
half an hour late, met with a mixture
of booing and clapping. As the
Minister and all the other guests
walk in and take their seats, the
chair of the Hellenic Society, Mixalis
Dinalexis, takes the stand and makes
a small introductory speech. As he
talks the polarization in the room
becomes evident. In the front sit the
members of the Society responsible
for organising the event and those
who are in agreement with the whole
idea. In the back are those unhappy
with this initiative – those who
are angry at the Government and
the Health Minister. As Dinalexis
talks there are angry comments and
laughter coming from the back – not
a good sign. However right before
he steps off the podium he makes a
good point “…Who would be better
for a challenging discussion than the
Minister of Health”. It is admittedly
very hard to corner Georgiadis,
so a challenging discussion is an
understatement of what is about to
follow.
The Greek Ambassador is given
his turn to speak and welcome
the Health Minister. Shortly after,
Georgiadis gets up to speak and
briefly, chaos ensues. Again clapping
mixed with booing and comments
regarding Georgiadis’ affiliations
with LAOS [Popular Orthodox
Rally – a populist right wing Greek
political party] spark a series of
comments from the Minister
including: “So this is the Troika [the
European Union, European Central
Bank and International Monetary
Fund – the three groups responsible
for the Greek bailout] resistance,
what a resistance! I’ll start crying!...
I don’t deserve this charade”. He
ends up challenging the hecklers to
come on the stage and talk openly.
A young woman takes the invitation
and proceeds to read a prepared
statement that paints a sad yet true
picture of the state of Public Health
in Greece, based on facts and studies.
She talks with confidence, as the
audience listens in silence.
As Georgiadis tries to reply to
the points made in the decleration,
shouts and insults are shot at
him again. At some point he yells
out sarcastically: “…what a great
democracy you are…. I can reply
(but) it will never be possible for us to
understand each other”. As the crowd
settles down, he starts tackling the
points made in the declaration again.
He starts off by renouncing political
responsibility prior to 2011. He then
describes the actions taken to tackle
the crisis. Again the crowd reacts
and the conversation deteriorates.
At some point Georgiadis is heard
asking the audience: “You are the
democrats? You know nothing about
democracy…. If you think you are a
resistance to the Troika by spending
your parents money…” The audience
is justifiably outraged, several
people are clearly professionals, not
affiliated with Imperial and can be
heard shouting back: “We work!”
At this point one of the organisers
takes over and asks both sides to
have a civilized conversation without
insulting each other. The Minister
starts talking again. To questions
about the cuts, the privatisations and
their necessity the Minister replies
in a challenging tone “…the people
decided to keep the country in the
Eurozone and this is what it’s taken
to stay in the Eurozone … Can you
find a solution to a country that is
bankrupt? … I believe that the state
cannot make profitable enterprises.
The people voted for me. We believe
that privatizing will create revenue.
If you are PASOK [Panhellenic
Socialist Movement – cenre-left
Greek political party] I don’t know.”
The discussion continues for a total
of about two hours. Generally few
