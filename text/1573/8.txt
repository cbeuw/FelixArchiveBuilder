I
nternational Night (I-Night):
Beyond Barriers 2014 organised
by the Overseas Societies
Committee (OSC) took place
last Thursday at the Great
Hall. Bringing together 10 different
Imperial College student societies in
a nail-biting competition, it involved
colourful acts from Thai Society,
Hellenic Society, Irish Society,
Belly Dancing, Malaysian Society,
Funkology, Japanese Society, Dance
Company, Bangladeshi Society,
Cypriot Society and a catwalk by
Fashion Society!
Four esteemed judges, including
Yas Edwards (DPCS), Sharon Bolton
(Head of International Student
Support), Anne Barrett (College
Archivist) and Anthony Crowther
(Students Activities Manager) were
invited to judge which act deserved
to win the I-Night Award of £200.
Each member of the audience was
also automatically entered into a raffle
to win a £100 travel voucher, kindly
provided by STA Travel – talk about
a good deal!
Directed by Yiting Low and the
OSC team led by Charmain Li, the
show featured stunning performances
ranged from the Malaysian Society’s
impressive traditional Dikir Barat
composed of a troupe of over 40
students and Funkology’s fierce
street dancing, to the Irish Society’s
performance dancing and the
Fashion Society’s combination of
original creations and traditional
dress. Together, it was an eclectic and
culturally educational evening!
However, there could only be one
winner… which was rightly claimed
by the Japanese Society, who adapted
the traditional Japanese folk tale
Momotarō, and filled it with lots
of laughter, including cameos from
Pikachu and Pac-Man!
All in all, it was a diverse and
entertaining affair this year, with
reviews raving about performances
that were better than ever! Keep your
eyes peeled for next year’s competition
which promises to be a spectacular
show of Imperial’s multicultural
diversity!
