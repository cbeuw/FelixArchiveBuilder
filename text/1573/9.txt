The global carbon market has not happened in a
harmonised, top-down fashion as expected by policymakers
and analysts in the 1990s and early 2000s. But rather, it is
growing from a bottom up approach – building on a multitude
of systems that do not follow one blueprint, but have found
different answers to questions like cap-setting, allocation,
scope, and flexibility provisions
A
t the end of February,
Nick Clegg and energy
secretary Ed Davey
announced a joint
deal with Shell for the
retrofitting of the Peterhead gas fired
power station in Scotland with Carbon
Capture Storage (CCS) technology.
Whilst the UK would lead the world
with such a project, there has always
been a black cloud of doubt over CCS
as a way to meet our ambitious CO2
emission targets.
The Peteterhead power station
managed to beat off several other
contenders to become one of two
powerstationstowinthegovernment’s
CCS competition. The signing of the
deal marks the first major step in the
project by commissioning a front-end
engineering and design (FEED) study.
On completion, the plant will have the
ability to power around half a million
homes with clean energy by removing
up to a million tons of CO2 emissions
per year.
The £100m project will capture
up to 90% of the emissions from
one of the plant’s three gas turbines,
simultaneously cleaning up the North
Sea gas feedstocks whilst creating
up to 2000 jobs in the construction,
operation and technical management
of the CCS system. The deal with Shell
willmakePeterheadthefirstlargescale
large gas power station in the world to
capture its carbon emissions and the
excitement over this was captured by
Deputy Prime minister Nick Clegg
who stated that “it shows we can build
a stronger economy and do it fairly by
protecting our environment for future
generations.”
Whilst the optimistic mind-set of
Mr Clegg is certainly quite appealing,
it is well worth examining CCS more
deeply to grasp why it has taken off
relatively slowly despite having been
initially developed a relatively long
time ago. CCS is touted for great
things with the IPCC estimating its
economic potential to be between 10%
and 55% of the total carbon mitigation
effort until year 2100. Despite this, it
has to date been fraught with major
concerns over economic efficiencies
and technological hurdles. CCS
has actually been around for many
decades but is yet to proven effectively
at the scale of large power stations.
The main concerns have been
around the successful joining up the
all the parts of the process, namely
capture, transportation and storage,
a task that has proven notoriously
difficult. Furthermore, given that all
parts of the process work, there still
remains concern over the costs of
running a CCS system and many have
questioned whether it is really worth
its traditionally enormous price tag.
Further still, it must be remembered
that attempts to initiate role out of
CCS have failed with the UK’s previous
CCS competition attempt having
collapsed. Whilst the announcement
of the Peterhead project is a hugely
exciting one, dredging up of such
memories should remind us to
proceed with caution but should in no
way thwart ambition.
A
new report released in
February has shown
last year to have been
a record year for the
implementation of new
carbon trading schemes around the
globe in an effort to help curb carbon
emissions. Whilst China, the world’s
largest greenhouse gas emitter has
led the way with five new schemes,
Europe has had to make adjustments
to its scheme to ensure it remains fit
for purpose.
China’s five schemes implemented
last year make up over half the total of
nine schemes implemented globally,
the other four being in Kazakhstan,
Switzerland, Quebec and California.
The Chinese schemes are at the
metropolitan and provincial level
and will act as precursors to the
implementation at the national level in
the near future. Such activity is highly
significant and marks a clear move
awayfromusingcommandandcontrol
measures such as bans and standards
to reduce emissions, towards a more
market based approach.
The report which is the first of its
kind is produced by the International
Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP)
and is designed to fulfil the monitoring
requirement necessary to ensure
carbon trading schemes are effective
in reducing emissions globally as their
prevalence increases. The report,
which will be published annually, will
allow countries to learn from each
other in how best to implement the
schemes. In a press release the ICAP
stated “The global carbon market
has not happened in a harmonised,
top-down fashion as expected by
policymakers and analysts in the
1990s and early 2000s. But rather, it is
growing from a bottom up approach
– building on a multitude of systems
that do not follow one blueprint,
but have found different answers to
questions like cap-setting, allocation,
scope, and flexibility provisions”.
The report also details how Europe
will have to make major alterations to
ensure its carbon market continues
to operate effectively. The European
Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)
is one of the EU’s cornerstone policies
to combat climate change and whilst it
is the oldest and largest scheme of its
kind, it has suffered severe problems
such as the steep drop in carbon
price following the 2008 economic
crisis. The ICAP report makes
implementation recommendations on
the proposed EU ‘backloading scheme’
where 900 million carbon credits will
be held back from entering the market
to spur activity.
2013 was a great year for
implementing new carbon trading
schemes and guidance provided by the
new ICAP report in integrating and
unifying what has thus far been a piece
meal, bottom up approach, means that
2014 may well be even better.
A
study published this
month has displayed
the possibility that a
doctor’s stethoscope
could be a major source
of bacterial transmission in clinical
practice. The study, published in an
issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings,
exposed how stethoscopes contain a
huge number of bacteria relative to a
doctor’s hands.
The results found the diaphragm
of a stethoscope (the larger side) to
contain more bacteria than every part
of the hand except the fingertips. One
of the strains of bacteria found on the
stethoscopes was the multi-resistant
MRSA. The authors concluded that
every physician should clean their
stethoscope after every patient
examination.
This is not the first time the
prospect of stethoscopes being a key
cause of infection has been disclosed.
Way back in 1972, an article in The
Lancet examined 100 stethoscopes
from doctors of different specialties
in a London hospital and found
them all to contain large amounts of
bacteria, including the food poisoning
staphylococci bacteria.
Dr. Didier Pittet, director of
the Infection Control Program at
University of Geneva Hospitals, in
Switzerland said, “The important
implication is that the stethoscope,
whether used by a doctor, a nurse, an
assistant nurse or any staff, needs to
be cleansed after each use.”
Hopefully, doctors will follow the
advice of the experts and think of
the stethoscope as an extension of
their fingertips, in order to reduce the
lethal transmission of multi-resistant
bacteria.
