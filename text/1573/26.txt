Maciej Matuszewski reviews Jack Vance’s highly influencial se-
ries set far in the future on a dying planet Earth
Though I fancy myself reasonably
well read in the field of science fiction
and fantasy I must admit that there
are quite a few classic authors of
the genre whose work I haven’t read
at all. Of these the one I probably
felt most guilty about not checking
out was Jack Vance. After all, he
was a Science Fiction and Fantasy
Writers of America Grand Master
and has been cited as an influence
by a number of my favourite writers,
including Neil Gaiman and Gene
Wolfe. Therefore, having found
myself with a little spare time a few
months back, I decided to check out
one of his most notable works – the
epic Tales of the Dying Earth series.
A set of four books published
between 1950 and 1984, Vance’s Tales
of the Dying Earth series is set far in
the future, with the sun beginning
to grow cold and humanity resigned
to its inevitable doom. Over the
millennia, science has given way to,
or become indistinguishable from,
magic. Wizards are a commonplace
sight and dangerous fantastical
creatures roam the desolate wastes
of Earth.
Each book is made up of a number
of more or less interconnected
stories. In the first book, The Dying
Earth, the stories paint a broad
picture of Vance’s world. He clearly
had an impressive imagination,
which is on full show in these stories
– the dying Earth is a vibrant yet
mysterious place with a unique
feel. Vance was also a highly skilled
writer technically. His descriptions
could almost be called beautiful
and, while his characters are often
underdeveloped and even clichéd,
their dialogue is sparkling with wit.
I would stop short of calling it a
brilliant work but there is much to
commend it.
Unfortunately, however, the sequels
do not share the charm of The Dying
Earth. The other three books have
more of an overarching story but this
change, rather than allowing Vance
to introduce more depth, works to
show off his flaws as a writer. While
on a technical level the prose is
still above average, the novelty of
Vance’s world quickly fades. The plot
feels dry, tired and almost painfully
repetitive – the second book, Eyes
of the Overworld, and third, Cugel’s
Saga, in particular have almost the
same story.
The failures in characterization are
already evident in The Dying Earth
are enhanced by having to follow the
same characters through an entire
book rather than just one short
story. What is particularly annoying
is that almost all of the characters
are deeply unlikeable. Vance tries to
portray many of them as charming
rogues but, without proper character
development, their behavior just
seems objectionable.
I can see why this series inspired
and captured the imagination of so
many writers. Vance was certainly
an innovator and his work does
show a lot of promise. Since Tales of
the Dying Earth was published the
concept has been executed far better
by other works, say Gene Wolfe
in his Book of the New Sun. People
interested in the history of science
fiction and fantasy should certainly
check it out but I doubt that it would
have much appeal to others.
The Dying Earth
“Vance clearly had
an impressive im-
agination, which
is on full show in
these stories.”
“The novelty of
the world quick-
ly fades. The plot
feels dry tired and
almost painfully
repetative.”
