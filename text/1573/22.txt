FOOTBALL / RUGBY
The morning of 12th March 2014
could not have produced better
conditions for a rugby match. Imperial
medicals RFC were hungry for a win,
having not won a Varsity match since
2011, a fact that ICU were only too
happy to keep repeating in the Felix
and on social media beforehand.
Our preparations for the game could
not have been better. Undefeated in
the league, with promotion all but
assured, through to the semi-finals of
the BUCS cup and in the final of the
UH Cup, we approached the game
with a confidence that had been absent
in the last few years. In previous years,
3XV teams had often bought in a host
of injured or outgoing players of a
higher standard for Varsity. But, with
a settled squad and BUCS promotion
on the line, we were strongly against
such tactics this year.
And so, after a rousing team talk,
the game began. IC started well, and
gained some early territory. However,
this small patch of dominance was to
be their last act of note in the game.
IC conceded a penalty at the scrum in
our 22, we were able to clear our lines,
and soon penned IC back into their
half with some strong carries from
forwards and backs alike. Soon, they
conceded another penalty on their
22m line. Unusually for a 3XV side, we
decided to go for points, thinking it
might be a close game. Unfortunately
Sam Harrison hit the post with his
kick. ICRC cleared to touch. A good
driving maul was set up from our
lineout, and rumbled over for a try.
Laurence Pallant selflessly handing
the ball to Joe Simmonds when he was
within scoring reach himself!
A good period of physical rugby
on our part ensued, with Ranjodh
Sanghera – fresh from his basketball
heroics in the copper box – and Shaan
Rashid ensuring a torrid time for
anyone foolish enough to run down
the centre channels, and breaking
tackles with ease when they did
themselves. This eventually resulted in
another penalty, which Sam Harrison
made no mistake with this time.
Minutes later a cracking break from
James “RugbyLeague” Turner down
the right wing almost bought a second
try, only for a heroic tackle from the
IC no. 8 to deny him, unfortunately
ending the tackler’s participation in
the day.
ICtriedtoholdout,buttheirdefence
was in vain, as Turner breached their
backline with a 70-80m jinking run,
dodging five or six weak tackles to
score his first of the day. Sam Harrison
crossed the paint soon after following
a flowing back move, to put a fully
deserved gloss onto the first half. At
half time the scores stood at 20-0 to
IMRFC.
While the medics’ half time team
talk revolved around consistency and
keeping up the same intensity we
had been using, IC’s team talk seems
to have been “How many 2s players
can we bring on and get away with?”
Unfortunately, their ploy was made
less obvious by the fact that one of
the wingers forgot to even change the
shirt he had been wearing in the 2s
game.
And so the second half began, and to
the disappointment of IC, their newly
bolstered back line was still no match
for Ranj & Shaan in the centres, the
latter soon smashing through the IC
line to score our fourth try of the day.
Some sustained forward pressure was
then rewarded with a sniping try from
Henry Clancy. He would call it just
rewards for his hard work – others
would call it opportunistic. The pack
continued to dominate, and another
rolling maul led to supersub James
Bloomer flopping over for a try.
The medics were still not done
though. There was time for Turner to
score another fantastic solo effort, only
slightly worsened by how far away he
kicked the ball in celebration. Captain
Fantastic himself then limbered up for
ten minutess of rugby, four months
earlier than his post surgery comeback
date. Despite taking one contact, to
the collective gasps of the crowd, all
shoulders stayed intact and the game
was closed out, and to the elation of
the medics supporters the rout was
complete.
Full time:
Imperial Medicals RFC: 44
Imperial College RFC: 0
This ended a two year hoodoo,
securedtheleaguetitleandmaintained
the 3s’ unbeaten record. The ‘grand
slam’ is still on, just the small matter
of BUCS and UH cups to go!
I hope that the crowd enjoyed the
day, despite the fact the free flowing,
offloading game may not have
contained enough ‘style’ and ‘dignity’
for some. Oh well, there’s always next
year.

Medics 3rd XV crush
College 44-0
With Varsity being the 1s’ final match
of the season, at home on a beautiful
Wednesday afternoon, we were
determined to finish on a high. With
the KO also being staggered with the
other matches so that a crowd was
able to watch from the side-lines, it
made the atmosphere all the better
and both teams were looking ready to
put everything into the game.
Both teams started well, but after a
short amount of time it was Imperial
who came out on top. There were
committed challenges going in from
both sides, but the good pressing of
Imperial meant that the Medics were
largely forced to try and lump it up to
their forwards, which the IC defence
dealt with very well. Imperial, when
they had the ball, were moving it very
well along the ground and getting into
good areas, with wingers Murphy and
Dale regularly beating their opposition
full backs as they have done all season.
Soon enough Imperial broke the
deadlock. After a well-worked pass
and move play involving Murphy
and Crawford, Crawford released
Robinson into space with his first
touch via a through ball heading to
the left of the Medics goal. Easily
outpacing the defender, Robinson saw
the onrushing keeper and finished it
first time with his left foot across the
keeper into the side netting of the
right side of the goal. This was his
96th goal for Imperial College in four
years which average 25 games or fewer
a season. He managed to score 4 on
the Saturday after Varsity in order to
complete his Century.
After scoring the first, Imperial were
well on top of the game and had the
lion’s share of possession, repeatedly
breaking well and causing problems
for the Medics’ defence. They should
have had at least another in the first
half after a brilliant one touch move,
again involving Crawford and Murphy
and including a Murphy first time left
footed chip over the defence to set
Robinson free. The move deserved a
first time finish, but Robinson decided
to take it down on his knee before
unfortunately firing the resulting
volley at the keeper. If it had gone in
it would have been a contender for
goal of the season – the slick first time
passing leaving the Medics defenders
static.
Robinson also saw a well struck
volley off of a bouncing through ball
just go wide, and Murphy saw one or
two long range efforts either be saved
or just miss the post. The Medics’
only chance of note in the first half
was when a ball over the top caught
out an IC centre back, with their
striker chasing it down well but then
proceeding to hesitate for too long
before firing the ball over the bar from
close range.
Thefirsthalfended1-0,withImperial
feeling that they should have had a few
more. 1-0 is a very dangerous score
line to lead with and Imperial walked
back onto the pitch for the second half
looking to get on top quickly and score
as soon as possible. Unfortunately,
quite the opposite happened as it was
the Medics who started better. For a
good chunk of the first period of the
second half the Medics had most of
the ball and were passing around well.
However, unfortunately they weren’t
able to convert this into a goal.
Soon enough it was Imperial who
were back on top. The Medics were
giving away too many free kicks,
and IC came close on a number of
occasions. One in particular saw
Private Lee Lawson send a header
towards goal, which then ricocheted
off the keeper back to him. He then
smashed a volley from close range
against the cross bar.
The second IC goal came after
Imperial camped out in the opposition
half for a while. Nugent passed
inside from the left to Robinson who
turned to his right to try and take on
a defender. Being faced with two in
front of him, he back-heeled a through
ball into the path of the sprinting
Murphy, who had just made a loud
call to let his presence known on the
left wing. Taking it in his stride, he
fired a first time left footed shot across
the keeper into the right corner, and
peeled off towards the crowd. The
resulting machine gun celebration left
a pile of bodies and beer on the floor
by the dugouts, and IC gathered to
congratulate him and each other.
As they were 2-0 down, the
Medics spent the last period of the
match switched to a more attacking
formation, as they threw men
forward in an attempt to get a goal.
Unfortunately, all this lead to was
Imperial cleaning them up on the
break down the wings, and if IC had
been more clinical the score line could
have been much higher. Robinson saw
a shot off a through ball go just wide of
the post, and one saved by the keeper
from close range after twisting a few
defenders, while Murphy and Dale,
amongst others, came close to adding
to their accounts.
The game finished 2-0, and even
though Imperial should have had a
few more, the season ended on a lovely
high, beating the Medics at home on
a thoroughly glorious afternoon. Fair
play to the Medics as they never gave
up and battled well to the end, but I’m
sure that they will be able to concede
that the better team won that day.
Man of the match was James
Murphy, next year’s 1s captain who
played his heart out and fully deserved
the award. Well done also to Alex
Dale, Omar Amjad, Chris Nielsen
and Ahmed Cherif who are leaving
the club after two, three, three and
three years of service respectively,
it has been a pleasure to play with
you. Special mention must also go to
Jonathan ‘Jonty’ Hill, who played his
last match for Imperial College this
Varsity after eight wonderful years
of gritty, leg-breaking service. He
is the definition of a seasoned vet.
Congratulations and best of luck in
the future to both of you.
College produce the goods to take win
