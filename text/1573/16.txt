THE SIDES AS THEY STARTED

O
n the 12th March,
a large number of
Imperial students
descended on
the Stoop in
Twickenham, home of the Harlequins.
But this day was not a regular match
day in the Aviva Premiership. No,
this was something on a much bigger
scale. This match day was the Varsity
clash where the JPR Williams Cup
would be won and lost. The crowd
gathered quickly, ready to see a closely
fought contest that would provide
much excitement.
They were provided with the latter,
but unfortunately not with the former.
The medics took control of the game
and kept it, and the college never truly
had a sniff of victory, despite taking
an early lead in the first half. The
medics soon put themselves on the
board though, and by half time had
already secured a 20-6 lead, including
two tries. Any hopes of a College
comeback were scrapped fairly early
in the second half despite an early try,
as the medics were ruthless as they
romped home to a 37-11 victory.
It was not the result the College
were hoping for, especially when they
got off to what was seemingly a strong
start. After the traditional fanfare of
coming out through a tunnel created
from a cheerleader routine, and being
introduced to various VIPs (including
JPR Williams himself), the College
began confidently. They spent the
first five minutes camped inside the
medics’ half, winning both a scrum
and a lineout within the medics’
22. However, they were unable to
capitalise, and could only take 3 points
