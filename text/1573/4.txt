r Maria Fernanda
Jimenez Solomon was
awarded the prize;
which is awarded to
excellent PhD students
who are doing research that helps
solve industrial problems. Maria’s
supervisor is the Head of the
Department in Chemical Engineering,
Professor Andrew Livingston.
Maria’s research focuses on
polymeric membranes, where plastic
microporous films can be used to
remove impurities and toxic materials
from pharmaceutical products.
A conventional membrane would
typically break down on exposure to
organic solvents that are used during
the process. The membranes that are
solvent stable are inefficient to use
as they only enable a small amount
of chemical to go through them.
However, the work undertaken by
Maria enables a greater amount of
solvent to pass through the membrane,
thus the filtering speed is greater. The
company Evonik has licenced two
patents that were produced by Maria;
Evonik are also sponsoring Maria’s
Postdoctoral research, which focusses
on creating filters that are larger so
can be used in industry.
The Director of the Graduate School,
Professor Sue Gibson said that:
“Maria’s outstanding research in this
area has led to a significant scientific
breakthrough which will have a major
impact on industrial purification
processes. The candidates for this
year’smedalwereverystrong;however
Maria’s determination, motivation and
persistence throughout her research
project make her a deserving winner.
We are pleased to be able to recognise
her achievements with this award.”
Maria commented: “The Armstrong
Medal is a very prestigious award
and I am absolutely delighted to have
been chosen as the winner. I knew
that I was up against a lot of really
interesting and exciting projects, so
this was a very unexpected honour.
I actually have a background in
Chemistry so I had never worked with
machines before I embarked upon
my PhD. The support and guidance
I received from Imperial – especially
from my supervisor – in this area has
been invaluable in allowing me to
achieve this success. I look forward
to continuing my research and am
excited at the prospect of developing
my ideas further.”

RCSU Science
Challenge Winners
Announced
Imperial Professor
elected as Einstein
Professor of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences
O
n Monday the
winners of the RCSU
Science Challenge
were announced at
the Science Challenge
Final, held at the Churchill War
Rooms.
The competition was open to
Imperial students and school children
who were tasked with chosing one
of three essay questions or the video
question.
The overall winner of the
competition was Emma Wills (also
a contributor to Felix Science) who
wrote an essay Pallab Ghosh’s 9 year
old daughter, encouraging her to
study Exoplanets when she reaches
university.
The judges, Prof. Fay Dowker,
former Felix Editor Pallab Ghosh,
Jon Kudlick of the Society of Biology
and former RCSU President Dr. Jad
Marrouche picked winning entries for
both Imperial and school submissions.
T
he Head of the Department
of Surgery and Cancer,
Professor Jeremy Nicholson
has been elected as the
Einstein Professor of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences. The
motivation of this award is to develop
the collaboration and exchange
between the world’s best institution
and China’s national scientific body.
Professor Nicholson said: “I am
delighted to have been elected to this
prestigiousroleandI’mthrilledtohave
the chance to work closely with some
of China’s leading research institutions
as part of the programme. This is an
exciting opportunity to contribute
to the training and development of
China’s future scientific leaders, and
I look forward to meeting many of
them during the visits and lecture-
tours over the coming year”
