I
t used to be that the world was
an absolutely awful place. People
were starving left and right in all
those countries to the South, the
hole in the ozone layer was going
to kill us all, there was no more oil left,
grubby foreigners were going to steal
all of our jobs, and the latest Star Wars
movie was the biggest tragedy of our
generation.
No matter which media outlet you
checked, bad news piled up higher
than the corpses of all the various
species we were forcing into early
extinction for fun. Every day there was
a new crisis that threatened to destroy
us: GMOs, the Y2K bug, El Niño,
you name it, we were on the verge of
global catastrophe RIGHT NOW, and
NOTHING would be spared.
While it was perhaps a ploy to sell
more copies of magazines or whatever
paper contraption people used to get
their news in the pre-internet days, it
was actually a rather inspiring state of
affairs.
The world was in bad shape, and
there was a mighty need for someone
to fix it. So much was wrong that
every kid could grow up to be a hero.
You could discover the next miracle
drug and cure AIDS once and forever,
or you could help save the rainforest,
or you could bring books to crippled
orphans in the Middle East. Did you
prefer the beach? The Great Coral
Reef needed a hand. Like the animals?
Pandas have trouble getting it on.
More of a people person? Gays aren’t
going to stop being persecuted by
themselves, you know.
Everywhere you turned, the world
was in dire need of someone to
save it and bring justice, peace and
prosperity. As we were told that we
were special little snowflakes, and that
in each of us there was the potential
for great things, we were presented
with a list of dramatic problems that
needed fixing. Each of us was a Harry
Potter that would save the world, the
last hope sent back in time to save us
all, the chosen one to save humanity,
the saviour that had to save, save, save,
everything needed to be saved by the
impending doom. Starving children,
oppressed minorities, failing crops,
dwindling resources, there always
someone or something that was just
waiting for a great hero.
But at some point the world stopped
being the trailer for a disaster movie.
The media never really took notice,
but reality did. More or less naturally,
things have gotten better. Nearly every
statistic used to measure our decline
shows that we’re really headed in the
right direction: the number of people
living in extreme poverty has gone
down, literacy rates are up, we’re
living in the most peaceful time in
history, and all of it without a messiah
to rise and ordain it.
The date for when we finally run out
of oil is being pushed back and back,
and we may actually wrap our heads
around these newfangled “renewable
resources”. After decades of violent
rhetoric, Iran’s new president seems
like an ok guy, and even the head
of the Catholic Church, one of the
most reactionary organisations in
history, is turning out to be a decent,
open-minded person; in both cases
it is more of a natural consequence
of the gradual change for the better
rather than a sudden dramatic shift in
mentality. All in all, things are looking
up.
Don’t mistake this for complacence.
Not everything is good yet, and
there’s a lot that needs to be done still;
but the situation was dramatically
misrepresented, and, even worse,
there’s no more need for a single
Great Man™ (or Great Woman™) to fix
it. The age of the individual is fading
fast, and now more than ever it is
collective, small efforts that are going
to make our problems go away, not the
actions of the single. There’s a reason
why the gay rights movement exists
and is healthy, but doesn’t have the
equivalent of a Rosa Parks or a Martin
Luther King Jr.: we’ve outgrown the
need for an individual to inspire
us and lead us, and instead rely on
everyone’s contributions.
This is all well and good but
unfortunately it means that standing
out is next to impossible.
Some of us wanted to end world
hunger by creating a giant tomato,
dammit, and instead it’s going to be
a slow but constant process of more
efficient food production, less waste
and better management.
Sure, there’s bigots and homophobes
and racists in power, but they die and
are replaced by more tolerant leaders.
Fifty years ago they fought interracial
marriages and, having lost that battle,
today they have to fight gay marriages:
eventually, things will get better.
The last thing that megalomaniacs
have got going for them is hoping that
the new Star Wars movie is awful and
overfilled with lens flare. Maybe there
will be a need for a messiah there, to
bring to the franchise the salvation it
needs.
This universe scarcely needs a
saviour, but perhaps the Expanded
one does.
Tell me it’s O-Kaye
T
he most controversial
of next year’s sabbatical
officers is, no doubt, Chris
Kaye. In an online media
outlet that may never be
named within these pages, we are told
that the incoming Deputy President
(Welfare) ran on a platform of a scaled
back and cost-effective union, merging
the positions of Deputy President
(Welfare) and Deputy President
(Education), and has a mandate from
students to roll the union back.
This claim is at best mistaken and
at worst disingenuous: Mr Kaye’s
manifesto promised donations to the
scholarship fund, a vote on whether
sabbatical officers should become
honorary life members of the Union,
and pressure on college to reform
draconian coursework rules. These
are all very worthy policies, but Chris’
big point about reducing the number
of sabbatical officers was nowhere to
be seen on his manifesto, and was not
information that was readily available
to voters.
In fact, it took cross-examination on
STOIC’s “Meet the Candidates” show
for the real story to come out. After
a perplexing chain of reasoning that
started with pub chat with an alumnus
who had a good time at Imperial back
when there was only one sabbatical
officer, Chris Kaye told viewers that
he intended to get rid of the Deputy
President (Welfare).
Now, it was never clear why Mr
Kaye becoming DP(W) would be the
most effective way to achieve this; as
he himself pointed out, any Imperial
student can bring a paper to council.
What is even less clear is why some-
one who doesn’t think a job should ex-
ist is the person that should be doing
that job. How does Mr Kaye have any
incentive to expand and improve the
welfare offerings of the Union, when
he himself thinks that students should
take their problems to the college in-
stead because it is better run than the
Union?Meanwhile, the problems that
students at Imperial really face every
day continue. We still see extremely
high levels of stress and low levels of
satisfaction among students, we have
big problems with mental health and
sexual assault: Mr Kaye’s response is
to suggest that we need less rather
than more attention focused on the
pressing welfare issues that we face.
This brings to mind his campaign for
Gender Equality Officer, running on
the platform of “this position does not
need to exist.”
We have been told recently in an on-
line tabloid (the name of which I can-
not remember) that Mr Kaye’s elec-
tion as Deputy President (Welfare)
will prompt debate and allow students
to evaluate what their Union should
be doing for them. This is true in the
same way that telling the police to not
turn up for work might show us how
much we rely on the enforcement of
laws for public safety.
There is a vulgar saying that goes
something like, “it’s better for one to
be on the inside of the tent pissing out
than on the outside pissing in.” Mr
Kaye, through his (often admirable)
dissent in Union Council has shown
that he was never afraid to attack the
Union, but now he is very much in-
side, we have to make sure he does not
try to piss all over us.
