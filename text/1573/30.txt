3) Third is Martin Scorsese’s self-in-
dulgent romp, The Wolf of Wall Street.
Wolf is basically the story of one man’s
descent from righteousness and mor-
als into greed and corruption. Some-
how the combination of lavish parties,
public groping and goldfish eating
work together, making an unforget-
table 180 minutes. Though perhaps
overlong in places, this is Scorsese at
his finest, managing to keep you from
wanting to punch Leonardo DiCap-
rio’s Jordan Belfort in the face. Just.
4) The penultimate film of the even-
ing is Philomena, our fourth best pic-
ture nominee of the evening. Though
almost certainly a feel-good film, it
manages to avoid the normal pitfalls
and clichés of this sort of film, man-
aging to be heartwarming rather than
the usual sentimental mush this film
could have so easily become. The
premise is simple, an Irish woman
gives birth out of wedlock and gives
the child up for a closed adoption to
the US. Years later, Philomena meets
Martin Sixsmith, a BBC journal-
ist with whom she decides to search
for her son. Much of reason that this
film was such a hit was the near fault-
less performances by Judi Dench and
Steve Coogan who, between them and
the rest of the cast, make the tear jerk-
er scenes do what they are supposed
to, and fill the rest of the film with a
subtle tinge of hope.
5) The All-Nighter is wrapped up by
the only one of the five not to be based
on a true story, Alexander Payne’s Ne-
braska. Continuing this year’s theme
of a monochrome film to end the
night, this gives a stark, surreal and
utterly beautiful feel to the film. From
black and white sunset to the rolling
field of Nebraska, the cinematography
is wonderful, helping to elevate it from
good to something truly great. As
does the absurd humour, summoning
stifled giggles and out loud laughter
in most scenes. Especially at six in the
morning that this film will be playing.
So there you have it, this year’s All-
Nighter line-up, featuring five Best
Picture nominees, four true stories
and a bucket and a half of tears. Bring
your friends, your mild acquaintances,
that guy who studies on the same floor
of the library as you that you not to oc-
casionally and most definitely bring a
pillow. See you there!
