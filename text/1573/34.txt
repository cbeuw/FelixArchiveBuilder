FRIDAY 21 MAR
don’t remember anything after that.
Thursday
To deal with my hangover I stay in bed
all morning and read the news online.
Apparently there is someone having
more luck than me with the whole
merging thing over in Crimea, seems
legit.
Friday
Bloody EU. I stubbed my toe this
morning because I had to buy one of
those energy saving light bulbs that
don’t produce as much light as the
good old fashioned British ones. And
then I got really angry about human
rights laws and the metric system.
These Eurocrat facists trying to merge
everything and make us all the same.
Bastards.

You finally suck up the courage
to have your first gynaecologi-
cal check-up, only to find out
that your doctor has prosthetic
hooks for hands. It hurt, but
now you can only get aroused
by photos of Abu Hamza.
Someone used your pass-
port to steal a Malaysian
airplane and now you’re the
number one suspect. You’re
on every no-fly list, and even
worse, they’ve barred you
from the Union.
You didn’t win your Union
election, but don’t worry, you
have bigger problems. Tak-
ing two weeks off has tanked
your coursework grade and
the leftover sweets have
filled your bedroom with ants.
Hope it was worth that drunk-
en pity sex on election night.
Your comedy Facebook page
‘Ruin Someone’s Investigation’
has been eclipsed by the Tell
Someone Something scandal.
The worst part is having your
expertise go to waste while you
could have ruined the college
investigation in a much better
way. Say, with balloons and
shit.
You read out all of the horo-
scopes, telling your friends
what Hangman said would
happen to them. One of them
takes the time to remind you
that horoscopes aren’t real,
before inviting you to join in
his protest about public cross-
roads being shaped too much
like crucifixes.
You buy a huge bag of sugar
free gummy bears as an
April Fool’s day prank for
your housemate. The joke’s
on you however, as his anus
becomes Niagara Falls while
banging your drunk girlfriend,
leaving you to hose them
both down while they cry and
apologise.
You try to distill your own vodka
in your bedroom, but when
you drink it, you realise that
you have somehow fermented
a dying rat, into a drink that’s
strangely delicious, but it gives
you horrible visions about how
your friends are going to die.
Your girlfriend convinces you
that she’s pregnant so that you’ll
stay with her, but you notice that
she’s suddenly not pregnant
whenever someone offers her
any kind of alcohol. Your friends
don’t want you to dump her
because they would miss your
sloppy seconds, so you just
shrug and go back the library.
After winning DPW, you re-
member that you pledged
one third of your sabbatical
salary to student scholar-
ships, some of whom may
international students. You
throw up all over yourself, and
cover the eyes of your Nigel
Farage shrine, lest his disap-
proving gaze fall upon you.
You’ve been doing her work
for weeks now, and she still
doesn’t seem likely to put out.
Enough is enough, you decide.
She can write her own lectures,
and mark her own goddamn
problem sheets.
It’s almost 11pm and you’re
sat in a hotel room writing
horoscopes. Some people or-
der pizza, others order extra-
cheap hookers that try to steal
your passport in a desper-
ate bid for freedom, but not
you. You write nonsense for
a newspaper nobody reads.
Shit just got self-referential.
Your plot to murder the annoy-
ing guy in your lecture goes
down the pan when you realise
you’ve never actually been in a
fight, and CSI is grossly exag-
gerated. Also, he looks really
mad, so you probably want to
drop the bat and run. Right
now. Don’t look back.

My Week As A
Sab-Elect
West Basement
Migration Conspiracy
Monday
Dear diary, last week I won an election.
I thought everyone would realise that I
stood because of a drunken bet made
in Eastside, but no, now I have to stay
here for another year. At least I get
paid an exorbitant salary, so that’s OK.
Tuesday
Today I thought I’d start as I mean to
continue, and do some merging. On
my way into college I decide to merge
my bike into a car, because no student
union can really afford to have both
a car and a bike. Unfortunately, I am
gravely injured. Well, at least I’m not
an international student and I don’t
have to pay to use the NHS.
Wednesday
After a shaky start with the merging I
think I should give it another go. My
lecturers didn’t seem keen on merging
with UCL, and the bus driver was not
happy about merging with the tube,
but they call the loony left loony for a
reason! Later, in Eastside, I decide to
merge beer, wine and cheap whisky. I
The Consequences Of A Huge Waste Of Effort
Thisweek,themediasocieties,STOIC,
IC Radio, and Imperial’s second best
newspaper, Felix, are moving from the
basement. The filthy hovel that has
been the home to all of our college’s
palest and least popular dorks will be
renovated into something boring.
This past year has seen all of the
media groups working closer together
than ever, producing some of the best
work ever censored by the Union’s
publicity team. But by putting all of
their media eggs into one basket, and
moving that basket somewhere stupid,
they have unwittingly copied the BBC.
Our Hangman Scientists have used
their clever models and statistical
mumbo-jumbo to extrapolate
forwards into the future of the Media
group. Based on our projections,
Felix will be repeatedly criticised for
being the mouthpiece of the Union
by a newspaper with a somewhat
questionable reputation.
Then, even after they move all of
their news offices to another location,
all of their main stories will be based
upon their original location. Any
criticism of this will be met by the
cries of “Nothing happens outside
London!” by the BBC, or “Where the
hell is Silwood Park?” by Felix.
Lastly, the once proud organisation
will be mired in scandal as almost
all of their old stars turn out to have
been sex offenders. ‘Journalists’ at the
Tab (I’m legally required to add the
quotation marks) have already begun
hacking phones and guessing wildly in
order to determine who the perverts
are.
But perhaps the biggest questions
for the future of the Media group are:
Where will they move to? Will the
stuff get any better? Are we ever going
to get sick of Metric Moments? Will
the deposed Joe Letts get an enormous
severance package? Or will it all end in
tears and broken promises?
Sabbactical-To-Be
DPW
Following the tumultuous events
surrounding the unseating of the
tyrannical dictator, Joe Letts and his
obedient minions, it is only right that
we take time to reflect on how this will
change student publishing at Imperial
forever. Much like the fall of the Soviet
Union or Arab Spring, the great 2014
Felix liberation will provide both hope
an trepidation in equal measure.
For sure, we have rid ourselves of
one of the most evil publishing figures
in Imperial history, but rebuilding
process will be slow and the chance of
counter-revolution instigated by the
Onion Knight remains an ever present
problem.
Most of all, it is important the we
stick together in these troubled times
and really pull through, if not for
ourselves, then for the incoming class
of 2014-15 who are, as yet, untainted
by this horrible, horrible war.
So, go forth this day and write. Flood
the Hangman offices with all sorts of
colourful writings, be it the simple
joy of discovering a new recipe/TV
program or an opinion you’ve always
wanted to get on paper. Now is the
time for truly, we are free at last
from the whip of tyranny. Long live
Hangman.
