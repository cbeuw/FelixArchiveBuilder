T
he number of doctors
travelling abroad on
‘humanitarian’ missions
in order to provide help
for the millions of people
suffering in less developed countries
is nanoscopic. In fact, more doctors
in the less developed countries such
as Ghana, Sierra Leone and Syria
are migrating to the UK because
of the attractive salary and more
sophisticated health system. This
leaves these countries starved of
healthcare professionals of which they
are in dire need.
57 countries in the less developed
world have a ‘critical shortage’ of
health workers, meaning that there’s
fewer than 2.5 health care providers
per 1000 population. 2.4 million extra
doctors, nurses and midwives are
needed to meet the global demands
for health workers.
The situation in Ghana is a prime
example of the health disparities
which are occurring worldwide. There
was a 47% increase in the numbers of
Ghanaian doctors emigrating to more
developed countries between 1998
and 2003. Furthermore, the number of
doctors who practice in the UK who
were trained in Ghana increased by
110% from 1999 to 2004. The reasons
for migration are obvious: better pay
for the physicians, a better quality of
life and a superior government policy,
to name a few. Richer countries should
do more to alleviate the consequences
of this ‘brain drain’.

caring for the vast numbers of people
suffering from infectious diseases,
doctors should be encouraged to
undertake humanitarian missions at
some point in their careers. A lack of
doctors who are willing to go on these
humanitarian duties has urged the
British Medical Association (BMA)
to act.
Recently, the BMA announced that
they will offer thousands of pounds
to doctors and nurses in order to
fund them on humanitarian missions
abroad. Grants of up to £3000 are
available from the BMA, who said:
“the cash is intended to help with
travel and subsistence costs from a
fund with a total value of £20,000.”
In the future it may be possible
for such philanthropic missions to
become a compulsory part of the
medical curriculum. In India, this
has already happened, from 2015
all trainee doctors undertaking the
MBBS course will have to undertake
a mandatory rural posting at a rural
public health centre. India’s 148,000
public health centres, which are the
closest primary care stops for nearby
villages, are predominately only run
by midwives.
Although there is a huge shortage
of doctors endeavouring to help
out in less developed countries,
some physicians have committed to
reducing the health inequalities taking
place. Barbara Jemic, a reconstructive
surgeon who works at the Royal Free
hospital in London, undertook a
humanitarian mission to Sierra Leone
last year. She said: “I travelled to Sierra
Leone to provide essential training
to a number of local doctors, nurses,
therapists and medical students.
Straightaway I was hit by the stark
contrast between the resources,
facilities, and level of care accessible
in the UK compared to the developing
world.”
David Nott, a general surgeon at
Chelsea and Westminster hospital,
has been labelled the ‘Indiana Jones’
of surgery. He has taken unpaid leave
annually to provide help and to train
doctors in warzones for over 20 years.
Starting in Sarajevo in 1993 and most
recently in Syria, he operates, trains
and innovates in the most extreme
conditions.
Dr Terry John, chair of the BMA’s
international committee, who was
behind the idea of funding doctors to
help out in less developed countries,
said “... it is incredibly inspiring to hear
of colleagues showing great drive,
courage and enthusiasm to improve
the lives of patients across the world.”
The people who embark on these
magnificent journeys lead by example
in the world of medicine. Future
doctors should be inspired by the
difference they are making and
should strive to reduce global health
inequalities.

ancreatic cancer has the
lowest survival rate out
of the common cancers;
only three percent make
it past five years, with the
majority only making it to 4-6 months
after diagnosis. The campaign aimed
to improve public awareness regarding
this. Its tagline portrayed how those
with pancreatic cancer wished they
had other types which have better
survival rates and well researched
treatment options hence the named
‘envy’ campaign. Kerry, a sufferer
herself, said she honestly wished
she had breast cancer. She pushed
for pancreatic cancer to gain more
attention and in consequence more
funding for research to help people
like her, which is definitely positive
and to be applauded. However, the
comparing of different cancers is a
controversial concept, which evoked
strong opinions, especially from those
with the identified ‘preferable’ cancers
like breast cancer.
Pancreatic cancer doesn’t result
in symptoms until its late stages
of development, when it can cause
the unspecific symptoms of upper
abdominal pain that intermittently
spreads to the back, weight loss,
jaundice and diabetes. These are
important to spot early on, report
to a doctor and if necessary obtain
adequate medical attention to slow its
relatively rapid progression and raise
its poor survival rates. So of course the
public need to be informed about it.
Nevertheless the comparison to
different cancers in my opinion was
off key. Its main flaw I think was that
it seemed to trivialise other forms of
cancer by pitching the survival figures
against each other. Every cancer is
devastating to an individual and their
family; looking past the numbers it
is the context of the disease which is
important. With more than a third of
peopleintheUKwhowillbediagnosed
with cancer in their lifetime we are
likely to experience this. And yes of
course pancreatic cancer sufferers
will wish for a better outlook but that
is true for any situation and speaking
plainly encouraging comparisons
between cancers is not helpful.
I admire Kerry and support the drive
for public health awareness but think
there are different more helpful angles
to do so. Perhaps, focusing on hope
and defiance in the face of cancer, as
the Irish Cancer Society has recently,
will garner a more positive response.
The campaigning charity “will never
forget Kerry who will be dearly
missed, and remain in the hearts and
thoughts of all of us at Pancreatic
Cancer Action".

W
e are even closer
to seeing Britain
become the first
country in the
world to allow a
three person baby to be born through
IVF, as draft rules were announced last
week to regulate the process. This is in
an attempt to help mothers with faulty
mitochondria bear healthy children.
Mitochondria are the ‘powerhouses’
of cells, where respiration occurs, and
contain 0.2% of genetic material. They
are inherited solely from the mother.
If the DNA in them is mutated, then
this can result in children inheriting
mitochondrial disease, which severely
affects 1 in 6500 children – more than
that affected by childhood cancer.
These disease-free IVF babies would
be created with the genetic material
from the two parents but using a donor
embryo with the nucleus removed.
This would mean the baby would
inherit the donor’s mitochondria but
only the parents’ DNA. The draft rules
currently proposed suggest that the
children will not be able to find out
the identity of the donor – in a similar
manner to that of organ donors. These
regulations still need to be reviewed
as part of a public consultation but
could be legislation by early 2015. It
is predicted that only ten cases a year
would qualify for the procedure, as
only the worst affected women would
be eligible. The Department of Health
fully backs the proposals and have
stated that the review is not about
whether it should be permitted or
not but merely about how we should
regulate it. While some herald this
as a great start towards combating
mitochondrial disease, others are
much more sceptical about the ethics
behind this and claim it is one step
further towards ‘designer babies’.
