In these troubled times of expansion,
there are inevitable f r u s t r a t i o n s and .dis-'
appointments and one tends t o take slow
progress f o r granted. I n these circumstances
i t i s perhaps not s u r p r i s i n g that there
should be a c e r t a i n amount of apathy among
students as a whole. However i t i s c l e a r -
l y of paramount importance that the student
body should voice i t s opinions, even on on
minor matters, so that the pattern of
College l i f e w i l l develop f o r the benefit
of future students as the College grows.
I t i s rather disturbing, therefore, to
note that a recent memorandum requests that
a l l press enquiries on 'general College
matters' should be referred t o an Adminis-
t r a t i o n department which w i l l be made res-
ponsible f o r o f f i c i a l press releases.
Whilst i t i s undesirable that a national
mountain should be made out of a parochial
m o l e h i l l , i t i s unthinkable that anyone
should f e e l bound to silence on a matter
a f f e c t i n g student welfare.
Hot that I am advocating a press cam-
paign f o r more hostels and r e f e c t o r i e s —
p e r i s h the thought. But i t i s t h i s sort
of d i r e c t i v e which makes people think
twice about opening t h e i r mouths, thus
increasing apparent indifference and,
possibly even g i v i n g those i n charge the
idea that a l l i s - w e l l when, i n f a c t , i t
might not be. There have been f o r example,
many mutterings about various rooms i n the
new Union, but has anything been specif-
i c a l l y stated
We must be c a r e f u l t o d i s t i n g u i s h bet-
ween general oollege matters and Union
matters. I say that anything d i r e c t l y
a f f e c t i n g us as students i s p r i m a r i l y
the concern of the Union, and i t i s up t o
a l l of us t o help the Union o f f i c a l s i n
t h e i r job and t o l e t them know when things
are not as they might be. Otherwise our
representatives w i l l lose interest and the
Union might just as w e l l become another
department of the Administration, not
r e f l e c t i n g student thought at a l l .
Union Meetings, the Union Offioe and
l e t t e r racks are a l l convenient avenues of
approach and remember that i t i s the weight
of opinion which gets things changed - so
don't leave i t t o the other man. I f ypu do
have an opinion why not make i t known?

H o l y T n n i b y C h u r c h
Having known the Union since 1945, may I
be permitted to make a few oomments on the
r e b u i l t and redeoorated b u i l d i n g whioh i s
now becoming available. I t i s of course
too l a t e to protest against the use of
b u i l d i n g ideas of the early twenties whioh
has resulted, among other defects, i n a
serious lack of daylight, especially i n the
ground f l o o r rooms.
Turning now t o the i n t e r i o r decoration,
the treatment of the lounge can only be
explained i f i t i s assumed that i t i s the
work of an entire amateur. How else can one
explain the o v e r a l l feminine e f f e c t , with
the strong suggestion of a h o s p i t a l wait-
ing room Surely no q u a l i f i e d i n t e r i o r dec-
orator, knowing that t h i s room would be a
meeting ground and a place of relaxation f a r
a mostly male society, could have chosen
those f r i l l y lower class over-bright l i g h t s
those hygienically stark gleaming white
walls, that ponderous showcase and those
uncomfortable and parsimonious chairs.
Was the bar perhaps designed and b u i l t f o r
a now abandoned public house along the Great
North Road? Certainly i t shows no great
advances i n either s t y l e or concept.
The Lower Dining H a l l suffers badly of
oourse from lack of daylight and a f e e l -
ing of space and a i r i n e s s .
I t i s d i f f i c u l t t o decide whether the Upper
Dining H a l l was designed f o r the holding of
the r i t e s of Freemasonry or whether i t i s
part of, i n the parlance of our American
friends, a Funeral Home where we may ex-
pose our Loved Ones f o r the l a s t time to
-the'gaze of t h e i r friends.
No doubt i t w i l l be suggested that I am
merely an o l d diehard, upset because the
old scheme of things; has summarily' been
changed. As however I have 'sard s i m i l a r
opinions expressed by other members, may I
suggest that a f t e r the whole b u i l d i n g i s
completed, you i n v i t e one or two w e l l
known i n t e r i o r decorators to inspect the
Union. Afterwards they should be asked
to "write, down t h e i r i n d i v i d u a l oomments,
which could then be published
I t i s of course not f o r me t o provide
reajodles, but i f the judgment of these
professional c r i t i c s i s as I expect i t to
be, may I be allowed as a L i f e Member of the
Union t o make some suggestions f o r future
redecorations:-
Engage a known i n t e r i o r decorator f a m i l i a r
with t h i s type of work. Explain exactly t o
him, and make him see, by whom and how the
room or b u i l d i n g w i l l be used. Decide
exactly how much may be spent on the work.
Allow the decorator t o do exactly as he
pleas»s.within the budget,. Allow no one, I
repeat^no one, t o i n t e r f e r e w i t h h i s design .

TOUCHSTONE WEEKENDS
From our Correspondents.
Kulture at I.C., f o r a large number
seems t o be confined t o sex and beer, and
i t i s thus not surprising that the d i s -
cussion '.weekends at Silwood are not attend-
ed by greater numbers. For those who are
unaware of these weekends and do not wish
to remain i n that state,we have unearthed
a few f a c t s , and publish then i n the hope
chat we she.ll be able t o render a public
service. They take place about twice a term
and the cost i s 10/- or f o r those whose
finances are governed by beer, about seven
pints.
In exchange,you get free transport t o
and from Silwood, situate i ' l the wilds of
Windsor Great Park amid several picturesque
pubs; food, .farm fresh f o r the weekend, and
a bed that i s sometimes comfortable. For
those who d i s l i k e talking f o r t h e i r beer,
there i s a l i m i t e d supply on ohe premises.
(We have been unable t o ascertain which
brands of beer are available!) Sport
abounds, especially when a suitabl y
large number of Icwarians have been misguid-
ed enough t o attand.
As f o r the discussion sessionsj 'Vari-
ous authorities come down to speak on
t h e i r special subjects, and afterwards they
answer questions from the enlightened
s c i e n t i s t s . After a break f o r l i q u i d
refreshment (tea), the assembled stud nta
form discussion groups t o enable them to
show each other'which of the long words they
have been able to understand!
A f t e r discussion, the groups report
back on t h e i r deliberations, and the meet-
ing adjourns.
The Speaker last weekend was Dr. Joshua
B i e r e r who spoke on the subject of 'The
Hurt Mind' - a survey of the problem
of mental i l l n e s s i n modern society.
The rambling discussion t'.at followed
ended with the participants opting
for f o u r hours a week of p s y c h i a t r i c
