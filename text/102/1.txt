FLOWERS'" TO BE GIVEN A TRIAL
A PETITION SIGNED BY 146 PEOPLE HAS BEEN PRESENTED, ASKING THAT THE BAR BEER
BE CHANGED TO FLOWERS' BREW. SOME OF THOSE WHO SIGNED THIS PETITION HAVB
since confessed that they have never tastedt
Flowers' b i t t e r J This should produce an
amusing and i n t e r e s t i n g discussion at the
next Union meeting!
Meanwhile, intensive research on the
properties of Flowers' b i t t e r i s i n pro-
gress. This beer was served unannoun-
ced l a s t Friday. Of twelve bar regulars
questioned, eight had not n o t i c e d any
difference, three thought i t slightly-
b e t t e r than usual, the other thought i t
tasted l i k e acorns (he l a t e r admitted
he had never eaten acorns). This brew
w i l l be given a more prolonged t r i a l
next week, 30 c a l l i n and see what yom
think of i t .
A l e t t e r from Mr. Higson o f f e r s a s o l -
u t i o n to t h i s problem. He w r i t e s , 'There
are four taps i n the new bar. I would l i k e
to seedraught Worthington issuing from
one and Younger1
3 Scotch Ale from another.
This leaves two other taps; perhaps some-
one else would l i k e to suggest how these
should be used. I would not mind paying an
extra penny or so per p i n t , but I am ready
to agree that a cheap v a r i e t y should be
available.' « 1
I n c i d e n t a l l y , c r i t i c s o f the condit-
ion of the bear may l i k e t o know that
representatives of two well-known brew-
eries have declared that the beer serv-
ed i s i n perfect condition. I f you r e -
oeive a warm glas3 of beer shortly, a f t e r
opening time, return i t and ask the bar-
man to pump more out t o c l e a r the pipes
of beer which may have been l a v i n g there
f o r some time. I f you receive a "cloudy"
glass, you should also return i t . E i t h e r
the b a r r e l i s nearly empty , or has not
been given long enough to s e t t l e . The
w r i t e r ' s experience has been that warm o r
oloudy beer occurs only r a r e l y i n the new
bar, and that the brewery representatives'
opinion i s correct. This i s a great
t r i b u t e t o Dan Lloyd and Jim Anderson,
who have done so muoh good work i n the
bar during Ted's absence.

HERE WE HAVE THE CAMEL*
About two weeks ago, a prominent mem-
ber of Silwood Park Union(composed off I.C.
residents at Silwood), r e l i e v e d Cambridge
University A g r i c u l t u r a l Cpllege of a 6 f t .
stuffed camel. This camel i s being c h r i s -
tened "Nasser" on Feb. 15th.
About the same time, some mining geol-
ogists on a weekend f i e l d course erected
a lavatory c i s t e r n on the top of a pole by
the side of the refectory. Mines' colours
were painted on various objects whioh had
previously been adorned by those of C.&G.
A l e t t e r complaining about thi3 was l a t e r
sent to the Professor of the Department,
but t h i s was received i n true I.C. fash-
ion: no action was taken.
Another incident occurred a week l a t -
er, when these far-flung members of I.e.,
the Silwood residents, having t i r e d o f
pranks with Royal Holloway College, chal-
lenged Bedford College to a Tiddleywinks
Match. An outstanding v i c t o r y was record-
ed.
Two of the above incidents were report-
ed i n SENNET. We are wondering why the
phantom reporter- who i s presumably an I.C.
man or woman - d i d not consider his College
newspaper worthy of h i s news.
