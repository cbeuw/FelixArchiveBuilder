advocate block-voting, we
wouldn't want you to blindly
reproduce this at the ballot box
in the Med School Lodge." The
advice, which also gave the
times of voting clearly had a
huge effect on the outcome of
the elections.
W i t h hundreds of these
slips being distributed, the
favoured candidates recieved on
average received 227 St Mary's
votes. In the poll for DP(F&S)
this overcame the majority that
Annie Matthewman achieved
on the South K e n s i n g t o n
campus. It was also the first
year that an official has stayed
with the St Mary's ballot box at
all times, so the medic's union
was not able to bring the box
around lecture theatres as was
usual previously.
At South K e n s i n g t o n
voting proceeded with some
hitches, with a number of the
swipe card machines not
working. F E L I X understands
that not a l l the machines
functioned properly during the
City & Guilds elections the
previous week, but the
problems went unreported. As
these problems may have
contributed to the decline i n
turnout this year, U n i o n
officials are considering a
return to voting solely by
Union Card.

who are involved i n activities
such as trade u n i o n
representation. CRS spoke warily
to F E L I X , fearing that speaking
out may hinder the chances of
renewal of their contract. When
asked about the unfair dismissal
waiver Rob L a t h e m said "the
college expects departments to act
in a responsible way."
from page one)
The A U T proposals will be
sent to the Committee of Trade
Unions in college. This is made
up partly of personnel and partly
academics. "The academics want
the best staff not the cheapest"
said Julian Borrill adding that the
proposals "have support amongst
both the CRS and permanent staff
community."
He added that "it should be
noted that nationally only 5% of
permanent scientific staff are
women whereas 40% of Contract
Research staff are women,"
continuing, "this is a women's
issue too."
But Rob Lethem concluded
by saying that "the new contracts
should be seen as a benefit."

School Daze
Never close your eyes i n the
F E L I X office - you don't know
who might wander i n . Last
Wednesday, as I lent over the
light box attempting to stick
down photograph of Sarah White
with a flan on her head at the St
Mary's hustings, who should
enter but a little girl.
Over to the reception desk
she marched, satchel a-swinging.
"Hello!" she demanded. "Errr,
hello," I replied, not wanting to
seem like a clique to this ardent
enquirer. Has paedo-fashion
descended this far? I wondered.
When fifteen of her mates
arrived, I remembered. The kids.
Over the previous few weeks
a coordinator from the Pimlico
scheme here in college had seen
me at least three times to try to
arrange some spectacular event
for a group of school kids on a
Wednesday afternoon. I con-
sidered that twenty kids entering
the office on a hectic Wednesday
afternoon would be experience
enough and forgot about it.
'Injuns, bah!' said Custer.
They all lined up before me
like a firing squad, tall ones at the
back, short noisy mischievious
ones to the front. But rather than
await the command to fire they
took pot shots at will. "Where's
the newspaper then?", "Are you
going to write about Arsenal?",
"Are you Maxwell?", "Boring!".
A h e m . A t this point I
panicked. A couple of years ago I
wanted to be a school teacher.
Now I wanted to be bunking off
again. I panicked and took them
to see the p r i n t i n g presses,
knowing that machines quieten
little kids. (Top tip - steamrollers
are brilliant at this). It worked,
but it also quickly quietened M r
Printer. Fearing I'd have a new
Brady on my hands and little kids
entrails splattered all over the
next issue I quickly herded them
all out again.
Acutely aware that they'd
still not been told of how a
newspaper works, I directed them
to Andrew Smith, newshound.
He's best placed to teach them the
ways of the media, the ins and
outs of journalism, I reasoned.
I'm best suited for cowering at the
back. "Do you make things up?"
they asked. A l l sweetness, he
responded: " W e l l I try not to
usually," displaying admirably
the integrity of F E L I X staff.
Lying about lying!
The scariest moment though
was when I took eight of them
into the camera-room to enlarge a
picture from J17. "Now, if I put
Matt under here..." I said, moving
the picture into place. "Whose
Matt? That's Ant!" they chimed.
And "Well, they all change so
fast," had said my mother.
