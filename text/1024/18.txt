mud
It's hard to know what to say about
Maria Irene Fornes' play mud. You
could view it as autobiographical I
suppose. Fornes, like her character
Mae, has experienced illiteracy and
poverty. But it doesn't follow to
then go on and say that as
happened in real life, the play
concerns the power imparted to
Mae by her education. Indeed
what's most striking is how non
metaphorical the play actually is. Its
events just happen, without there
being any underlying reasons for
them. Which is, in this case, a
general criticism of the play. Things
happen - so what - things happen
in everyone's life. The point of a
play, especially one that rubs itself
in the dirt of realism, is to place
such events within some sort of
unified scheme, not just leave the
audience confused.
The plot, as it stands,
nominally concerns the fragment-
ation of the relationship between
Mae and Lloyd that occurs with the
entry of Henry. The men start poles
apart; Lloyd is young, ill,
desperately poor and uneducated
whilst Henry is pretentious,
relatively rich and middle aged. As
Mae passes her attention towards
the latter, Lloyd is compared,
clumsily perhaps, to the hermit crab
which has lost its shell. Yet as the
play draws to a conclusion Lloyd
grows stronger, whilst Henry ends
up a wasted cripple. Mae fli(r)ts
inbetween the two, all the while
becoming dominant. But for all the
parallels available Fornes doesn't
appear to be making a statement
about education, feminism, sexual
empowerment or religion.
None of this would matter
however, if the play was gripping in
and of itself. And whilst it
approaches it in places, noticeably
in the physicality of the opening
scene and wide eyed naivety of
Mae, these remain piecemeal in
sum. Just as Mae, Lloyd and Henry
end the play in extreme states of
despair and paradise, so the
audience are left in an
uncomfortable limbo, half way
between their destination and the
place they started at.
Did you know that Paul Merlon
was a guest on Desert Island Discs
two years ago? To me, this is like
writing your autobiography at the
age of 25, but perhaps it's just a
signal that the powers-that-were
thought they'd better get in quick
before he fell from grace. To judge
by this production of Arthur Smith's
live b e d show at the Garrick
Theatre, in which he stars
alongside his wife Caroline
Quentin, the downward curve has
yet to start.
Live Bed Show is a play which
happens mostly in bed, and we
were encouraged to remember this
through the purchase of some
pyjamas in the foyer. The set
consisted of two single beds which
slid together to form a double bed,
which strokes of genius allowed the
full gamut of possibilities: scenes in
his bedroom, her bedroom and the
bed section of a department store.
The bed-happenings included
dreams, fantasies and, I think, a
real story about things like
• E S f l i
decisions and commitment. More
importantly, there were laughs -
but not too many. From Arthur
Smith and two comedians, you
might have expected more rolling
in the aisles, but there wasn't really
the space, and there weren't really
the jokes.
Up on the third tier of the tall,
thin Garrick Theatre, I felt a little as
though I was peering down from
the top of a sort of inverted Tower
of Pisa, and it didn't really sink in
that I was watching Paul Merton
'off the telly' until about half way
through. Sadly, though, it wasn't
really Paul Merton off the telly. His
true talent is in making people
giggle helplessly at silliness, and
Live Bed Show was a play with a
message, not a punchline. 0

This blazes into action. It's
frantic punk pop, with a catchy
buzzsaw guitar. The vocals are
animals that swim -

It starts, "I was in a car crash"
and goes about spraying
fountains of blood that look like

ballad of lobster hoy
I'm currently basking in their
album, but this single [not on
the album] is the best thing they
have done. Half ballad to half
indie epic anthem, 'Lobster Boy'
is the most poignant song I've
heard since the last Madder
Rose album. Definitely single
of the week.
