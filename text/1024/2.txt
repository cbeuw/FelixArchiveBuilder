Fire
Alarm
B Y J O H N SINNER
The much criticised fire alarm
system i n Linstead H a l l has
come under further scrutiny.
False alarms have occurred with
tremendous frequency, to such
an extent that residents now
appear to be treating the system
with disdain.
In one 24 hour period alone,
the alarms sounded 5 times.
Apparently this was due to the
installation of a new fire warning
system throughout the college.
The Linstead system itself
partially went on-line a month
ago. Since then they have been
sounding up to three times a
week.
Dr Jan Bradley, warden of
Linstead H a l l said i n an
interview with F E L I X that
"part of the problem is that
Linstead is so badly designed".
The new system includes heat
detectors i n the kitchen and
smoke detectors in the corridors.
It has been suggested that the
system may be too sophisticated.
For example, when people leave
doors open, smoke from the
kitchens drifts around the hall
and ultimately sets off the
corridor alarms.
Dr Bradley went so far as to
describe the new system as
"ridiculous" and cited the lack of
faith i n the fire alarms as a
particular concern. It was, she
said, " i n effect life threatening
because nobody takes it seriously
anymore."
Meanwhile, Graham Cox,
Imperial College's Fire Officer,
assured F E L I X that the
problem was being looked into.
He intends to have a meeting
soon with D r Bradley and any
interested students to discuss the
matter.
One possible solution is to
replace ionisation smoke
detectors with less sensitive
optical devices in the vulnerable
areas. M r Cox said: "We have to
find out the best way how to do
it without creating any security
risks".
International Fight
B Y R A C H E L W A L T E R S
Last Friday's International Night
was a sell-out success despite
internal bickering i n the
Overseas Students Committee
(OSC). It had been feared that
members of the Islamic Society
would disrupt the cultural show,
but the event passed off
peacefully.
Earlier in the week, Muslim
members of college had expressed
concern over a display by a group
of Pakistani women students.
Organisers of the event were
concerned that they would set off
fire alarms to disrupt the
traditional dance. College
security were on full alert
throughout the proceedings.
There were further
difficulties in the food show: the
Singaporean and Thai food could
not be served because of
administrative problems. T h e
addresses of the caterers who
supplied the food hadn't been
written correctly, and that this
meant that their food could not
be used.
Andreas M e r s h i n , O S C
Chairman, said that he thought
the event had been a success: "I
didn't expect it to go so well".
His committee have privately
expressed concern over his
leadership, with criticism
focussing on his managerial
skills.
His detractors on the OSC
admitted that they hadn't
actually expressed their comp-
laints until after the event.
Although they had wanted to
hold an extraordinary general
meeting to discuss the situation,
they were unable to get the
required 20% of memberships
signatures.
Hi-tech Heist II
B Y A N D R E W S M I T H
The Computer Department has
again been struck by a pro-
fessional gang of thieves, who
now appear to steal on order.
Last Friday an estimated Â£8,000
worth of processor and R A M
chips were stolen from the
department, which is still
recovering from a previous hit.
The processor chips appear
to have contained about 40
Megabytes and there is a
possibility that electrostatic
damage to the P C ' s and
Macintoshes could double or
even treble the repair and
replacement bill. Nine computers
were made inoperable by the
raider, but the department hopes
to have all of them back working
by today, resulting in only one
week of downtime.
The criminal activity took
place last Friday at around
3.30pm and was detected by a
technician who was working in
an adjacent office. It is still not
clear how the intruder managed
to get into the room which has a
sophisticated digitised lock, but
it is thought that he had been
there for at least ten minutes
before being detected.
M r J i m M u r p h y , Head of
Computing Support Group, has
described the technician as
'extremely brave'. T h e staff
member approached the sus-
picious person and escorted him
to the Security Lodge in Huxley,
but while security backup was on
its way the intruder escaped.
It is clear from raids on both
K i n g ' s and U C L that this
activity is highly organised,
using foreign labour who can
only be deported when caught.
King's was also hit last weekend,
despite prior warnings that they
were likely to be targeted. The
police have said these criminals
are prepared to defend them-
selves if questioned and therefore
asked the public not to approach
them.
The computers which were
damaged in the attack are mainly
used by students for projects,
many of which are due to be
finished in two weeks time. The
department itself will have to pay
for the repair and replacement,
until insurance money arrives. It
is hoped that inconvenience to
students w i l l be kept to a
minimum.
News in Brief
B Y L Y N N B R A V E Y
Southside shop
In an apparent change of heart,
Southside Shop has re-
introduced student discounts.
The outlet noted for its
outrageous prices (where a loaf of
bread is more expensive than
that sold in Harrods) is offering
a 10% discount to all Imperial
College students. T h e offer
applies, on production of a valid
Union Card, to all items except
tobacco, newspapers, phone
cards, stamps and items already
on special promotion.
New Dean
A new Dean has been elected for
the Royal School O f Mines.
Professor R D Rawlings starts
his three year post as of 1st
September 1995. He replaces the
incumbent Professor Shaw.
Civil Servants Served
The Management School has
been chosen as a provider of the
new Public Sector M B A
launched last week by Robert
Hughes, Junior Public Service
Minister. The M B A will provide
a broad yet dedicated resource to
the future leaders of the U K ' s
C i v i l Service. U p to 60 civil
servants are expected to
participate in the scheme in the
next academic year.
Professor David Norburn,
Director of the Management
School said, "I am delighted that
the Management School has
been selected as one of two
providers of this initiative. We
believe that our experience
w o r k i n g i n partnership with
industry, commerce and the
public sector qualifies us
particularly well for this role."
F E L I X Flooded
Whilst the student newspaper of
Imperial College has been seen
by some as rather dry this year,
this week its offices in Beit Quad
rang to a patina of d r i p p i n g
leaks. The flood appears to have
been caused by a blocked drain
on the flat roof, which resulted
in water lapping against the
ceiling windows of the print
room. Water also entered the
DJ's booth in the Ents lounge.
With mop in hand one F E L I X
staff member declared: "We're
going down!"
