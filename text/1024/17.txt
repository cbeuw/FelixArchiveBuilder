Disused coal mines, slag heaps,
barren wasteland and people
saying, "yow dirty rut" - hardly the
most endearing features of a
nucleus of musical activity. And yet
that's exactly the description that
befits Stourbridge; a Black Country
industrial town that spawned a
scene of its own. Personally, I never
had time for the Stourbridge scene,
and, like all victims of media-hype,
this one was doomed to eventual
anonymity. The Wonderstuff have
split up and Ned's Atomic Dustbin
are on the wane, leaving pop will
eat itself valiantly trying to keep
the boat afloat. And they're not
doing a bad job of it...
I never had time for the
Poppies either but last year's dos
dedos mes omigos opus was a
promising melange of guitar-heavy
rock, hip hop and dub that saw
them vying for attention with the
Sensers of this world. Now, they've
seen fit to release a double remix
album of what has become their
most successful long player to date,
cunningly titled two fingers my
friends (work it out, linguists). The
remixes have been undertaken by
fellow artists who claim to have
been influenced by PWEI in some
way over the years. And so we get
Fund-a-mental and Die Krupps
separately doing the anti-fascist
taunt of 'ich bin ein auslander', Jah
Wobble doing 'familus horribilus',
Renegade Soundwave doing
'underbelly', The Orb doing
'home', Fluke doing 'r.s.v.p.', and
so on and so forth. As a concept it
has distance, but predictably the
new versions stand up small when
compared with their original
counterparts. Too often the remixes
meander into monotonous, quasi-
ambient territory, and it's only
occasionally, such as on the Die
Krupps interpretation, that the
kicking drums and shearing guitars
are brought to the fore to
maximum effect (but then what do
you expect from a band that can
release technified Metallica songs
and get away with it).
At the end of the day, this
remix album is only for the absolute
diehard fans who feel incomplete
without everything put out by their
favourite band. If you haven't
bought 'dos dedos..' then consider
doing so, if you have then consider
doing something with this address:

Vik returns to the roots of an old english scene. Run to the
hills folks, it's pop will eat itself remixed. On a different
note, Andy T takes peek at moby's new album, A/ok takes on
van halen and tintin mingles with the stars with mike watt's
namefest, ba//-hog or tugboat?
In a full and measured week tintin fringes out watching mud
at the Ectera theatre, whilst Rebecca M. experiences the
intimacies of the family Merton's live bed show.
Cartoon characters may abound in F E L I X T O W E R S but
none is so two dimensional as tintin. It's rotation with a quiff
and snatch of americana.
Back in a time where print gossip was queen sat mrs parker
and the vicious circle; KT listened in. In another world
Michael Douglas was sexually harassed by Demi Moore (oh
yeah). Magpie got the early editions in disclosure.
Still searching for that perfect balance between their handles
and bodies, Fiona juggles her clubs down to hall of fame
and no room for squares.
pop will eat itself
Faceless techno boll'cks or
maybe not. moby, perhaps still
best known for the Twin
Peaksesque tune 'go', is anything
but another invisible artist. Most
people tend to notice a shaven
headed vegan Christian with a
penchant for climbing New York
lamp-posts. This persuaded me to
take the time to read the cover of
his album everything is wrong:
Moby seems to be a man with a
gentle message and a part of that
is breaking down prejudice.
I stuck in the cd and was
rewarded with a nice mellow
version of the single 'hymn' which
meandered along minding its own
business for a few minutes with me
thinking, hmm heard this all
before.
Well, I admit it, I was lulled
into a false sense of security and
then BANG! A track that's seriously
Jungle/Hardcore influenced starts
belting out of the speakers,
followed by a thrashy thing with a
gorgeous deadpan imitation of a
House vocal, next up a Hip-Hop
linker followed by a bit of old-style
Rave/Hardcore, then an Industrial
track, then it's 1 9 9 2 again and I'm
14 and waving my arms in the air. I
think you get the picture.
By now you're all thinking,
'Jack of All Trades Master of None',
but you'd be wrong. The sheer
energy and exuberance, and the
unpretentious way it's all put
together make the record fun to
listen to. Sod art, this is the point!
This album is a re-examination
of the history of house, but it never
loses sight of the present. Even in
its most retro moments there's
always something new, and
enjoyable to listen to. Everyone is
going to learn something new here,
and though there'll probably be
better albums released this year,
few will be so much fun. (7)
What can you say about the
man Van? Well, he's a quiet sort of
chap and plays the guitar rather
well, van halen have a new album
out called balance which he has
penned and if you go out and listen
to a copy you'll see (and hear) that
there are three others who perform
on it. The drummer is good. The
bassist is good. The singer,
however, is complete sh*te. He
would (and this is no joke) put Axl
Rose to sname with his attempts at
impersonating a castrated monkey.
The music is very good,
extremely good in fact. There's a lot
of versatility with long lead guitar
solos to short piano ballads. 'Don't
tell me' is menacing to start with
but is definitely the anthemic song
of the album. There are a couple of
instrumentals which make good
listening and there's even a few
good moshable tunes. But the one
message I want to cry out to dear
old Eddie - get a new singer. Then
the album would have been so
much better, but even with el
monkey impersonator, I'll give it a
generous (7).
mike watt compares his new
album, ball hog or tugboat?, to a
tag wrestling bout. Which is an
appropriate metaphor to encap-
sulate both the variety of partners
he grapples with and his own
instrument of choice, the bass
guitar. Bass players rarely star but
thanks to his connections as a
member of the now defunct
seminal band, Minutemen, Watt
gets to play with plenty of heavy-
weight ringsters. However, the fifty
different bodies he collects tag in
and out of the ring with a loose
abandon that can only result in a
mixed overall performance.
The opening tracks are the
best. Watt's gravely lined voice
starts proceedings with 'big train'
and backed up by the Vedder
powered urgings of 'against the
70s', these two, at least, seem to
validate the concept. However by
the time you hit the barren plains
of 'rounds' five and onwards, some
of the obvious improvisation starts
to get wayward and uncontrolled.
(With Mascis and Pirner particularly
indulging themselves in histrionics).
Which is the reason that such
things as bands exist and bass
players remain bass players. (6)
