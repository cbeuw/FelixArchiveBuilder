IjQl motormouth with a broken heart
mrs p a r k e r a n d the vicious
circle tells the story of Dorothy
Parker (Jennifer Jason Leigh), one
of America's most renowned and
quoted writers, and her circle of
friends who lunched every day for
ten years at the Alqonquin Hotel.
Dorothy Parker starts off
writing for Vanity Fair but soon her
abrupt manner and cynical attitude
lose her the job. Fellow critic Robert
Benchley (Campbell Scott) decides
to leave on the principle of this and
together they set up as indepen-
dent writers. At the same time Mrs
Parker's husband Eddie (Andrew
McCarthy) returns home from war
shell-shocked, addicted to
morphine and alcohol. Dorothy
seeks solace in her friends and the
next hour and a half of the film are
filled with the endless lunches and
parties she and her friends hold as
well as her love affairs, particularly
with Charles McArthur (Matthew
Broderick). We also see her
attempted suicide by slitting her
wrists with all too convincing sound
effects!
Dorothy's circle of friends
consisted of well-known journalists,
critics, playwrights, novelists,
actors. The lunch scenes are always
very hectic and it is often quite
confusing as to who is doing what,
when and with whom. The shots of
the camera panning around the
table while everyone is talking only
add to the confusion. The film is
also intercut with black and white
footage of Dorothy Parker reading
what are supposedly relevant
quotes from her work. She was said
to be a great humourist of her time
yet these quotes don't seem to
substantiate this. The clipped
manner of speaking adopted by
Jennifer Jason Leigh is often hard
to understand too which leaves the
viewer wondering how a young
woman in her thirties can end up
sounding like a woman in her
nineties. But the main problem with
the film is that it is based on a
group of people who probably no-
one is old enough to remember or
anyone outside of America is likely
to know. When added to the fact
Mrs Parker seems to have led a
rather unremarkable life, this
makes for a sleep-inducing film.
^ sweaty
hall of fame at RAW last Saturday
was one of the biggest fashion
statements i've seen for a long time
- this is obviously where the notion
of dressing up for the weekend
originated. One of the larger
venues around, Hall of Fame is
where 'the crowd' go out to play -
and the music is correspondingly
good. The 'boys from the old
school' were out in force, mixing
happily with the infants (like myself)
and a memorable New Yorker
offering champagne parties for
four! The music that greets you is
purely funky, dropped by Dezzie D,
Sinbad and Nick Shipton in the
sugar room - small, sweaty and
heaving, with a well deserved
reputation for excellence. Brian
Norman, Thad and Colin Reid
mount the stage in the huge main
room where the policy is mostly
swing, bar the occasional foray into
deep funk or even house. One of
the joys of this place is that the DJs
play whatever takes their fancy,
and it's quality all the way. The
atmosphere is pumping, the vibe is
pure party and the chill out space is
minimal - as long as there's music
this crowd will be dancing. Too
many Saturdays away from RAW in
the future and i'll consider my
weekends wasted.
A brief exception will be made
for no r o o m s for s q u a r e s
tomorrow, where Gilles Peterson
and Joe Davis hold sway for a night
of old and new school jazzy
flavours and a smattering of
Brazilian beats. Among the chosen
few recommended in i-D
magazine, it includes film shows
disclosure has been promoted
as a film about sexual harassment
with the twist that the man is the
subject of the harassment from a
woman. However the sexual
harassment is only part of the plot,
and the main theme is really about
corporate politics, though the
sexual harassment stands out the
most in the film, as it is used by one
character to control another person
in order to profit from it.
Tom Sanders (Michael
Doug/as) has pinned his hopes on a
high presidential promotion in the
firm Digicom. The situation turns
against Sanders and he is passed
over for Meredith Johnson (Demi
Moore), with whom he happened to
have an affair years before.
Sanders then finds himself the
target of Johnson's seduction.
When he rejects her advances she
accuses him of sexual harassment.
The film produces a tense
situation: you see Sanders' career
being sabotaged and his family life
falling apart. As he attempts to find
answers to his crumbling career
you see a complex game being
played out. Then when Sanders
starts receiving email from an
anonymous friend the question
becomes: who is actually
controlling Tom and who will gain
most from the outcome?
Michael Douglas is finally
showing his age and it's perhaps
surprising that the role didn't go to
a younger actor. Still Demi Moore's
character is aggressively ambit-
ious and manages to play the
corporate game better than the
men. The use of high tech virtual
reality and an electronics company
as backdrop merely gives the film a
nineties setting; the computer
effects were stunning, if a little out
of place in a corporate thriller.
The plot is not complex as
many thrillers but the varied
subplots will appeal to many
people. The interesting twists
during the film and the resulting
suspense makes Disclosure
enjoyable to watch. 0
plus a chill-out with pool and table
soccer (now that should please a
certain small sub-set of JCR
regulars). This is a relatively rare
event, and rumour has it a
particularly excellent one - only the
mad will miss it.
