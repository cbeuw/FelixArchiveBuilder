OPENING THE GATEWAYS
DREAMS OF EARTH AND SKY
©Father HONOURING THE ARTS IN THE DARK DAYS
Two years ago, a new degree course was unveiled: Physics with Performance
Studies. T h e four year course involves study both i n Imperial's Physics
department and at the Royal College of Music (RCM).
The launch of the new course met with much applause: "I think it has
opened one of the gateways between the institutions", said David Burgess, a
physics professor who helped set up Imperial's side of the deal, when interviewed
in the 1994 Alumni Newsletter. "For students whose interests span both the arts
and sciences, it's an opportunity to extend their work in both these areas", commented
current R C M director Janet Ritterman in a F E L I X interview.
But a connection between IC and the R C M is not without precedent. A link was forged
nearly 40 years ago by the director of the Royal College of Music, .erSir George Dyson, a man
whose p u b l i s h e d work i n c l u d e d a _ _
military textbook: Grenade Warfare as ,
well as more pastoral, musical, works
such as Sweet Thames Run Softly.
T h e l i n k runs on t h r o u g h his
family: .es'Sir George's son, *Freeman
Dyson, is an eminent physicist who
once gave the annual Schroedinger
lecture at I C . In this week's S-files,
discover the hidden link between IC
and the R C M . Find out about the lives
of a father and son whose talents span
the great divide. A n d rethink your own
ideas about the subject boundaries
which we so often take for granted.

A N INVOCATION TO SCIENCE
I Science then shall be a precious visitant:
: For then her heart shall kindle; her dull eye,
] Dull and inanimate, no more shall hang
Chained to its object in brute slavery;
But taught with patient interest to watch
The process of things, and serve the cause
Of order and distinctness, not for this
Shall it forget that its most noble use,
Its most illustrious province, must be found
In furnishing clear guidance, a support,
Not treacherous, to the mind's excursive power.
So build we up the Being that we are;
Thus deeply drinking in the soul of things
We shall be wise perforce; and while inspired
By choice, and conscious that the Will is free,
Shall move unswerving, even as impelled
By strict necessity, along the path
Of order and of good.
WILLIAM WORDSWORTH
Lines from "The Excursion" Book IV
77:
Wordsworth's words set to music by £$Sir George Dyson for Imperial
College's 1 949 Commemoration Day.
^"Dyson's handwritten manuscript is shown underneath.
.gfGeorge Dyson was born in
Halifax in 1883. At the age of 17
he won a scholarship to the RCM to study organ
and composition, after which he travelled
around Europe for four years.
World War One saw him as a brigade
grenadier officer, during which time he wrote
Grenade Warfare. The Dictionary of National
Biography for 1961 noted glowingly: "His
extraordinary versatility was manifest".
Z I Z Z Z Z In 1937 he became director of
^ ^ ^ ^ the RCM. Cutting his salary in half and
turning a classroom into a bedroom,
1 • j^Dyson kept the college open during
World War Two, saying that "the arts
should be honoured in the dark days".
^Freeman Dyson wrote in his
autobiography Disturbing the Universe
that this was "his father's finest hour".

the RCM and Imperial
A month after jgfDyson received
his knighthood in January 1941, the
RCM building was hit by a fire bomb,
and a group of Imperial students
helped put out the blaze.
After the war, an embryo
students' union formed. The RCM's
Centenary Record notes that with
.efDyson's blessing, "various musical
and social activities" were set up
between the RCM and Imperial. In
1949, .efDyson composed music for
part of Wordsworth's "The Excursion"
as part of Imperial's Commemoration
Day celebration. A Phoenix corres-
pondent wrote that "The colour and
pageantry of the Celebration is a
welcome innovation in the life of the
College".
In 1950, .efDyson was made an
! honorary Fellow of Imperial College of
Science, and he retired from the RCM
in 1952.
