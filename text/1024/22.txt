IC 4th vs QMW 3rd I

Another convincing performance
last week from the 4ths, white-
washing their visitors QMW 4-0.
Nick, drafted in to replace the
injured Richard, played
admirably at number 1 to win in
four games (3-1). Dave and
Garry, at number 2 and 3 respec-
tively, gave steady performances
and both won 3-1. The star of the
day, Alex, showed his team mates
how it should be done with a vic-
tory in straight games (3-0). It was
then off to Southside to celebrate
with loads of pizza and just a few
pints!

On a beautifully sunny Saturday
morning, IC played the final of
the London Colleges Cup against
Royal Holloway and Bedford, last
year's winners. Both teams were
very nervous and excited before
what was to be the best match of
the season.
Holloway won the toss and
took the first centre pass, but an
interception in their circle
deprived them of possession and
taking an early lead. However it
wasn't long beiore Holloway
movered lo pull hack. The matey*
continued in the same manner,
fust one team going 2 or 3 goals
netball. The practice on set moves
reaped rewards and almost all our
centre passes were successful. We
even managed to leave behind our
usual tendency to have 2 players
going for each ball in our attack-
ing third. The shooting was
exceptionally accurate, even from
the edge of the circle. IC defended
really well, never allowing
Holloway to take advantage of
their 6ft goal shooter with some
good interceptions. IC's tight
marking forced them to repeated-
ly infringe the three seconds rule.
When the final whistle was
blown after 60 minutes, the game
was unbelievably drawn at 27
goals each. We then picked our-
selves up again for a further 5
minutes each way of extra time.
Still the teams remained neck and
neck. It was simply a case of who
would have scored last before the
whistle went and unfortunately
luck was on Holloway's side, as
IC's last 2 shots went into the net
and bounced back out again. The
final score was 31-30 to Royal
Holloway.
It was a brilliant game and
neither team deserved to lose. IC
would like to thank their crowd of
supporters who came to watch the
game. Their cheers, chants and
Mexican waves really helped us to
keep going and at the end I think
that they were suffering from ner-

Fencing 0
fencers, IC took first place in
three way contest against KCJ.
and UCL last Saturday. The first
weapon was sabre, where IC won
2 closely fought matches 5-4 and *
5-3. The next weapon to be fought;
was the foil, in which we demol-
ished the opposition Jfaft^l (w
rth
a little help from The
Mangold™). Our epeeists cav
up against stiff opposition, beat-
ing UCL but narrowly losing to
King's. The real stars of the day,
however, were our beginners luil
team. Although facing opponents
with far more experience, they
battled well and were unlucky to
lose 2 closely fought matches. The
beginner's competition was won
by a combined team, fielding two
members of IC. Despite the
defeats, every member of our team
won at least one fight in their first
competition match.
The teams were:
Sabre: Nick Manton, Jeff Wong,
Y.K. Chan.
Senior foil: Chris Moon,
Lawrence Gould, Nick Manton,
Jeff Wong.
Epee: Reuben Kalam, Chris
Moon, Jeff Wong.
Beginners foil: Ambrose Poon,
Jamie Harle, Phillip, Y.K. Chan.
