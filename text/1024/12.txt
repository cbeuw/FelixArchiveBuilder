Tony Grew gazes into his crystal ball
The Oscars stand out above all the
other awards ceremonies as the
one everybody pays attention to.
You can have your Tony's, your
Bafta's, your Emmy's, your Brits,
even your Ivor Novello's but the
little bloke standing on top of a roll
of film with nothing on is still the
one everyone wants. With the
ceremony less than three weeks
away we here at F E L I X have
decided to provide you with a short
guide to this year's nominations,
all the better to talk knowledgably
in the Union bar with.
As you probably know, the
process by which a movie
personage comes to receive an
Oscar has as much to do with
Hollywood politics as it has with
doing good work. This year is no
exception, and that is why I am
going to try very hard not to go on
about who I think should win and
instead stick with who will win! For
example, Woody Allen has been
nominated for Best Director for
Bullets Over Broadway, but with
the year he has had I don't think
he will be honoured. Even without
the sexual abuse allegations he is
not a real contender because of
his distaste for Hollywood and his
refusal to attend in the past.
One also has to remember
that the Academy (Of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences), who
give the Oscars is one of the most
exclusive clubs in the world. As a
result most of its membership is
over 45 and very rich. They are the
Hollywood elite and do not reflect
the tastes of anyone except
themselves. This is why winning an
Oscar is so good for your career; it
shows you have been noticed. At
times the Academy have been
attacked for being too con-
servative, but their choices have
caused upset in the past, such as
the astounding award of the top
five Oscars (Best Actor, Actress,
Director, Film and Screenplay) to
One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,
being at that time only the second
movie ever to do so. There has
been rumours that Forrest Gump,
already the biggest movie of the
year in the US, would repeat this
sweep, having been nominated for
13 Oscars, one more than
Schindler's List last year and only
one away from the record 14
which All About Eve set in the
Fifties. But Gump fever was six
months ago, and although the
movie is still seen as a contender,
the intervening time and the
appearance of worthy challengers
such as Pulp Fiction and Quiz
Show means it probably won't do
as well as had been predicted
initially. 1995 is one of the most
difficult years to call in recent
memory for this reason, but we
have persevered and here are our
predictions:
B e s t P i c t u r e It looks like this
one will still go to Forrest Gump,
simply because of the sheer
amount of money it has taken and
the fact that Pulp Fiction is seen as
a little too violent to get any major
awards.

nominated before and it may be
good politics for an African-
American to win) and Tom Hanks,
though the chances of him winning
an unprecedented two years in a
row look more unlikely by the day.
Our bet is Paul Newman, because
he is very nice and makes his own
condiments, which is always a plus
I feel.
Best Director This one is easy -
Robert Zemeckis for Gump. After
making the Back To The Future
trilogy in the shadow of producer
Spielberg, this intensely well-liked
and admired director is certain to
take this one home at least.
Best Actor Could be any one of
them. This is by far the most
difficult to predict, Travolta looking
least likely for Pulp Fiction,
especially against heavy weights
like Morgan Freeman (been
B e s t A c t r e s s My guess is
Winona Ryder, because frankly no-
one else deserves it. Also Little
Women has been nominated for no
other awards, and she is seen very
much as a talent who should be
encouraged. Outside chance for
Susan Sarandon; although The
Client was mediocre at best there
seems to be a feeling that its about
time she won something. Jodie
Foster has little chance of a hat-
trick with Nell, which many people
suspect to be a deeply silly movie
undeserving of comment never
mind an Oscar.
B e s t S u p p o r t i n g A c t o r Two
months ago this seemed like a
certainty for Samuel L. Jackson in
Pulp Fiction, but the inclusion of
crusty British luwie Paul Scofield for
Quiz Show has complicated
matters. My personal hope is that
the 'foot fucking master' will
triumph.
Best Supporting Actress Uma
Thurman for Pulp, though Dianne
Weist is certainly a contender for
Bullets Over Broadway, and Helen
Mirren has become a household
name in the States with the Prime
Suspect series so she too has an
outside chance.
And t h e Rest Tarantino will win
for Best Original Screenplay, Eat
Drink Man Woman for Best Foreign
Film and Forrest Gump for cinema-
tography. We assume that The Lion
King will take all the soundtrack
Oscars (again). I will leave you to
decide for yourselves who will win
Best Sound Effects Editing, not to
be confused with Best Sound. The
ceremony is on the 27th March and
can be seen live on Sky TV. Not
that any of you have Sky. Q
