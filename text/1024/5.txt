Prater Fiam
Bashing
Dear Owain,
Firstly, let me congratulate on
the quality of Felix so far this year,
which far and away exceeds last
year's output. As you may recall, I
was not the greatest fan of your
esteemed predecessor, who was to
journalism what Pol Pot was to the
Cambodian Tourist office, as vital
to the running of Felix as David
Mellor is to the Elite Model Agency.
The newspaper has ceased to be a
wishy-washy magazine, containing
masses more material than was
the case last year. Above all, that
bloody awful cop-out of a cover
has been replaced by news that's
actually worth reading.
However, even the most rosy
garden contains the odd weed,
and despite the liberal doses of
Paraquat that you have applied,
one literary thistle has taken root.
I mean, of course, Frater Fiam.
From his earliest writings (Felix,
1006), in which he must have
scared the living daylights of the
poor freshers already a bit dubious
about choosing to spend three of
their formative years at Imperial, I
had my doubts about the state of
'your Frater', but decided it was a
phase he was going through, and
thought no more of it. Issue 1009
was a definite cry for help, so
much so that I did not expect to
hear from said columnist again.
Mais non, for in Issue 1018, we
begin to see the shift of this
troubled soul from the disturbed to
the impenetrable. Our Frater
rapidly learned the art of penning
400 words of purple prose which
said absolutely nothing. I think we
are looking at a man who could
teach Tony Blair's speech writer a
thing or two. To be fair, he
admitted as much in Issue 1015,
admitting "the realisation hits me
that many will say 'What a load of
bullshit'". To describe his columns
as a "puzzle" is a bit of an
understatement. A few weeks ago,
I nearly sent a birthday card c/o
Felix to our Frater, since, as no
student could afford such a huge
thesaurus as he was now using,
this was the only explanation.
These bizarre, meaningless
articles continued on and off with
talk even of "Confused Ramblings
on Senseless Topics" (Felix 1019).
In this complete and utter waste of
innocent trees, even the writer
himself questions whether "your
Good Frater has slipped beyond
the bounds of comprehensibility".
Maybe this bloke is Tony Blair's
speech writer? However, all of this
is of nothing compared to the
complete and utter drivel that
graced the pages of the latest
issue. If I have a cold, I do not feel
it necessary to share the
experience with the rest of
Imperial. On the contrary, such
matters are best kept quiet. To
talk of the common cold as some
kind of pleasure-inducing drug on
a par with more exotic "chemical
pleasures" is total rubbish. Friends
of friends assure me this is not the
case, and suggest that our Frater
has been looking in the wrong
places. Either that, or he has been
so successful in his pursuit of
recreational pharmaceuticals that
he's taken a long stroll out of
Realityville never to return. Were it
the case, then life as a drug dealer
would be as lucrative as that of the
Ambre Solaire sales rep working in
the Cleethorpes area.
The previous week, Our Frater
was missing, and I nearly wrote in
imploring all of Imperial to reward
you handsomely for a such a
public-spirited gesture. In the
same issue, there was a truly
bizarre article on the very mad
Yves Klein, whose only redeeming
feature seems to be a more than
passing resemblance to Dreyfuss in
the Pink Panther films. The
weirdness of the artist was more
than matched by the weirdness of
the article, by Marcus Alexander.
As a youthful, energetic first year,
my ultimate aim at Imperial was
not to achieve a First, but to solve
the two ultimate questions that this
establishment throws up - firstly,
how have Imperial College
Catering got away with it for so
long, and secondly to be able to
say 'Yes, I do know what the hell
Marcus Alexander is talking about.'
Sadly both were beyond the wit of
a humble student such as I. (Or so
I thought, until Marcus' excellent
and comprehensible 'Cat & Mouse'
this week. Bastard!). I then found
out that Frater Fiam is Marcus
Alexander. Everything makes
sense!
Marcus is clearly a very good
writer, as this week showed, but
allowing such self-indulgent,
meaningless rubbish that is no
more than a subtle advert for
Roget's Mega Thesaurus to clog up
the pages of Felix is too much.
The Docker's Fist has already
bitten the dust - although it was
the better of the two - and our
dear Frater should follow.

/ agree that Marcus is an enigma,
but I think a very worthwhile one. I
find that it cheers me up
enormously to find someone more
mentally disturbed than myself. As
for the possibility of him being Tony
Blair's speech writer... well, I always
wondered where all the money
came from. Oh, good surname by
the way 8-).
Night of the
long knives?
Dear Felix,
We are referring to last week's
news story: 'Japanese boycott
International Night' You quoted
Mr. A. Mershin, OSC chairman,
saying: 'Nobody else has had any
problems, nobody else has
complained, everybody else is
happy'. May we point out that this
is not true.
Whereas there have been no
written complaints, representatives
from overseas societies have
complained orally on more than
one occasion about Mr. Mershin's
notoriously disorganised way of
handling affairs and his lack of
communication. Meetings
throughout the year were mostly at
very short notice, with the venue
often changing at last minute. This
disorganisation became even more
obvious during the last week of
preparation for the International
Night. If it hadn't been for a
number of other people, the event
would never have happened.
We would therefore like to use
this space to thank the following
people in the name of the OSC
exec: The Union, the Stewards
and the Sabbaticals, Security,
Stoic, all the volunteer helpers, the
chairpersons of the participating
societies, the caterers for the food
fair, the bands, the DJ, the
performers on the cultural show,
the comperes, the societies' stage
managers, the backstage crew,
and last but definitely not least
DramSoc.
All of you did a great job and it
was a pleasure to work with you.
For OSC exec
OSC External Affairs Officer :
John Sinner
OSC Vice Chairman : Rahul Dua
OSC Events Officer : Ducan M.

It's sad to hear that you obviously
have no love for you Chairman -
have you raised the matter with him
personally? Or do you prefer
cowardly insults in Felix?
Communication can be a wonderful
thing if you try!
Ta IslamSoc,
talk to me
ULTJ
Dear Felix,
I am writing this letter for two
reasons: Firstly, to give my sincere
thanks to all at IC IslamSoc, for the
kind gift that they gave me.
During SCC week, I asked
someone at their stall where I
would be able to get a copy of the
Koran in English with explanation.
They said they would get back to
me with the information. Two
weeks later, I found a copy in my
union pigeonhole which they had
given me as a gift.
I would like to thank all of the
IslamSoc committee very much
indeed for this kind gesture.
On another issue, the ULU
elections. I nominated Damian for
a GUC position, only because I
met him in the street and he asked
me to sign his ballot sheet. He had
to explain to me what the position
was as I had no idea.
Perhaps ULU should make
more of an effort to inform each
individual college of ULU activities,
issues, policy and services offered
and also positions or offices
needed through each college's
services. Although we are a
"Central London" University of
London College, it feels very
isolated from the main body of
ULU and perhaps if more members
of ICY were aware of what was
going on, maybe through Felix,
Union notices, STOIC or any other
source, more ICU members would
play a role. We all have something
to gain from and contribute to ULU
and should not be left out of the
opportunities open to us.

Hear, hear.' Although I am but a
lowly firstyear, I have attended just
one ULU event. It does seem a bit
of a shame that we currently stand
a better chance of finding out what
is going on at ULU by reading Time
Out rather than F E L I X . Better
communication does seem to be
needed, but I wonder if that will
happen after the election of our old
chum Ghassan Karian as ULU
president?
