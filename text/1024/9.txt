Clued Up
T H E D O C K E R ' S F I S T
I have been most surprised to read
recently (Observer 5/3/95) that a
term like post-rnodernismgs, in
some circles, being applied to a
television program like "The New
Adventures of Superman". Perhaps
it's just me, but crap journalists are
definitely taking over the world.
Superman is a tried and tested
formula that sells things to
children. If you want to shift a
zillion units of kiddie wizz on CBS,
you do it during Superman, and
not during the fishing show. Any
allusions to post-modernism
(whatever that is supposed to be)
can only be a motif attached to it at
random by a low flying journalist
determined to sound clever by
being opaque. This is a common
phenomenon among music
journalists who constantly assume
that things mean something, when
their entire worth is that they mean
exactly nothing. It is not so much
that this is irritating to read, but
there i$ a not insignificant
proportion of society that would
obey the words of music journalists
as they would the word of god.
People talk about rock bands like
Elastica as if they had something
relevant to say and did so in an
original and erudite manner. The
simple truth of this is that they are
a fun sort of pop group that copy
all their music from old bands like
the Stranglers, and take their lyrics
off the back of cereal packets. The
music press however would have
you believe that Elastica were
formed when Sylvia Plath rose from
her self-inflicted grave and rang up
Johnny Marr. This sort of thing is
witnessed across the board; but if
was post-modernist Superman that
really caught my attention.
If post modernism means
what I think it does then in my life
it manifests itself on several levels.
Firstly and least amusingly in use
by shite students that like
Thunderbirds (the puppets not the
drink - on reflection we are
actually talking about the same
people however you look at it) and
walk around with the legend F.A.B.
emblazoned across their torso.
Another more virulent mani-
festation of these, circulate in
'Magic Roundabout' shirts, they
have a hidden agenda. They are
by
not only expressing their vastly
superior intellect over the masses
by their ironic post-modernist
fashion sense, they are also
advertising the fact that they smoke
dope and say 'man' at the end of
their sentences. Information which
can only lead the recipient to
swoon, with a burning and
irrepressible lust fired by the
knowledge that people au fait with
the student-drug Zeitgeist are in
fact deeply cool and not a bunch of
limp-dicked fuckwits (who
continually say 'man' at the end of
their sentences). Slightly more
amusing is the habit of renaming
things once named after Nelson
Mandela after television light
entertainers. Manchester Poly (god
knows what it's called now... ) has
a Bruce Forsyth Building, and
somewhere else has quite recently
acquired a Desmond Lynam
lounge.
Alright, alright, perhaps
there is a certain post-modernist
quality to superman "Is it a bird ? Is
it a plane? No, it's a brand-new
gay icon in blue tights.". Yes,
possibly there is a jolt of wit about
Glyph
it, but the suggestion of anything
dry or vaguely derisory about the
scenarios could only possibly be an
oversight on the part of the extra-
zealous script editors, as a result of
their consummate lack of humour. I
am yet to be convinced that it is
deliberately amusing. Where post-
modernism touches me the deepest
is when I don' t-realise that I'm
doing it. There has on occasion
been the need for me to describe
the appearance of women to other
blokes. This I am perfectly capable
of doing, but it still embarrasses me
to do so; (in case I get it wrong for
a start). I find myself describing her
as I would a centre forward. "Well,
she's very dominating in the air
and attacks space in the box very
well, but her control often lets her
down on the turn and her work
rate is suspect." I think this is fairly
innocent and harmless, but I will
know that I have created a monster
if one day I'm trying to buy a car
and the salesman tells me that "It
may have saggy tits and a drippy
growler, but it likes it up the Gary
and will nine time out of ten make
cheese sandwiches for the lads."
