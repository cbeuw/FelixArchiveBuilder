NatWest Manager
Heads East
Attack On Student
BY SIMON SHAW
The Manager of NatWest Bank's
Imperial College Branch, M r
George Jamieson, leaves today after
more than ten years at the College.
Mr Jamieson has built up a for-
midable reputation among students.
Since the news of his departure
became known, he has been awarded
colours (recognition for an out-
standing contribution) by all three
of IC's South Kensington
Constituent College Unions.
Mr Jamieson, who has been with
NatWest for 25 years, will be mov-
ing to their Regional Office at
Curzon Street. When asked if he
was excited at the prospect of mov-
ing, he said that he would be but for
the fact that he would miss Imperial
for which he has a "tremendous
affection". "I will always remember
Imperial," he said.
The outgoing manager feels very
strongly about the low level of
Government student grants. He con-
fesses to having bent the rules in the
past in order to accommodate stu-
dents' financial needs and admits to
being "unorthodox" in his approach
to student banking over the years
and has even been known to give a
struggling student money from his
own pocket for them to "buy a
Burger King". "You have to take a
long-term view with students," he
said. The bank expects to make a
profit out of them ten years into the
future when they are successful in
business or industry.
Since M r Jamieson came to
Imperial, NatWest have gradually
increased their share of Freshers'
accounts. Last year, 82 per cent of
Imperial freshers banked with
NatWest - the highest on record.
Mr Jamieson's successor will be
M r Hari Nair who comes from
NatWest's Branch at Onslow
Gardens. One project M r Nair
inherits is the possible installation
of a second automated cash-point
closer to Southside.
A female student was attacked last
Friday night whilst walking from
Southside towards Brompton Road.
The attack occurred at 1.30am in
the alleyway near the Holy Trinity
Church on Brompton Road. She
was walking with a male friend at
the time. The students managed to
fight off the attacker and they were
not badly hurt. Both students were
very shaken by the incident.
The attacker was white, badly
spoken, about 6'4" tall and with a
mop of brown hair. He was accom-
panied by another white male who
held back during the attack.
If you see anyone fitting these
descriptions, please contact College
Security (ext. 3392) or the Police
immediately. This is the first assault
of this type to have taken place in
the district in many years.
Pimlico Visit USA
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Five Imperial College students rep-
resented the Pimlico Connection at
a Campus Outreach Opportunity
League conference in Boston U S A
over the Easter vacation. This
Wednesday they gave a presenta-
tion to some of their sponsors,
including the Rector, Pro-Rector
and British Petroleum.
The Pimlico Connection Scheme
puts student tutors in schools to
encourage a better understanding
about higher education and science.
Similar schemes to the Pimlico
Connection operate in the States
and the Imperial College students
gained new ideas and were able to
promote their scheme to others at
the conference.
The students, Ian Gregory,
Richard Boardman, Kelda Bratley,
Vicky Owen and Joey Islam were
given a great reception by the
American students.
