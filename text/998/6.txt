Unlike other bars we select the best ales from different breweries, we
do not take all our beers from one brewery which would just give
variations on a theme, we give you a REAL selection. State of the art
equipment ensures each pint is of the very highest quality, and in
order to maintain our high standards, some of the above ales may not
be available from time to time. Prices quoted are per pint. If there is a
special ale you would like stocked, please contact the Bars Manager.
