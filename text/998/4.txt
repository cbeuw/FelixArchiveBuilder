Huntingdon's
Disease: how
the gene
responsible
was discovered
and what the
effect is on the
lives of the
sufferers and
their relatives
Imagine that you are in your
twenties. You've got a bright future:
a whole life ahead of you. You plan
to get married to your wonderful
girl/boyfriend a few years after
graduation - when you've both
made that first toehold on the world.
Now imagine that you are greeted
by an urgent message: Phone home
immediately. You rush off to the
nearest telephone and you are
greeted with your dad's voice. He
tells you in a low tone that your
mother has been diagnosed as
having Huntington's Disease. What
disease? Hunting who?
It takes a while before the gravity
of the situation seeps in; and you
rush off to the nearest library to find
out what Huntington's Disease is.
You discover the following:
a. Huntington's Disease (HD)
afflicts one in every 10,000
Caucasians of Western European
origin. It is less common in other
races but has been detected in
almost all populations studied to
date.
b. It is characterised by a prog-
ressive dementia with a middle
age (35-45 years) onset - an
asidious wasting of brain cells. It
results in the sufferer slowly
losing his/her higher mental
functions, gradually becoming
retarded and succumbing to death
by secondary complication (heart
disease or pneumonia) in about
17 years.
c. It is an autosomal dominant
disease.
If you understand the point c, the
full effect of this disease will hit
you. 'Autosomal' means that the
disease gene is not carried on the sex
(X or Y) chromosomes. 'Dominant'
means that if one of your parents has
the disease (hence the disease gene),
you will have a 50% chance of
suffering from it yourself. 50%
chance. A flip of a coin gives you
50% chance of getting either face.
You are desperate to know if you
are afflicted. Had you asked around
for a test before November 1983 - to
see i f you had this time-bomb
ticking inside of you - the answer
you would have got was "No". And,
if you were carrying a child, had you
asked for a test for your foetus, the
answer would have been even more
emphatic.
Your future shatters. Can you
bear the responsibility of inflicting
this gruesome disease onto your
unborn children? 50% chance.
That was precisely the position
Alice and Nancy Wexler were in in
1968. Their mother Leonore was
fifty-three when she was diagnosed
with the disease. She died after ten
years of suffering (having tried
unsuccessfully to take her own life
in 1970). Because of their
helplessness, Nancy and her father,
Milton, began a crusade to get
scientists interested in the disease.
As a result of the combination of
impeccable timing (the flourishing
of molecular biology and several
remarkable coincidences of
scientists being in the right place at
the right time) and their cataclysm,
the gene was finally located,
sequenced and published in the
March issue of Cell last year. It had
taken more than ten years of arduous
labour.
