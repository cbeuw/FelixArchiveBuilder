Mastering Degrees Rag Fete
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Science institutions are up in arms
over the implications of a new type
of Masters degree proposed by the
Department of Education and
Science. The Royal Society have
slammed the scheme in a report
released this week, describing it as
damaging and unnecessary.
The original proposal, put for-
ward in last year's White Paper on
Science, stated that anyone intend-
ing to take a PhD would need a
Masters degree, the idea being to
give students the basic skills
required before beginning a three
year research programme.
After almost a year of discussion
on the matter, universities, scien-
tists and industry remain united in
their opposition to the degree. The
Science and Engineering Research
Council calculated that the high
cost of financing graduate students
for an extra year would force it to
reduce by 30 per cent the number of
PhD candidates it could fund.
A new type of degree was pro-
posed by William Waldegrave in
February. A Research Master
(MRes) could be undertaken along-
side a PhD, preventing the need to
delay the start of a PhD by a year. It
was also indicated that students
who had taken four-year first
degrees may not need the MRes.
Some Universities have ex-
pressed enthusiasm for the new
degree, but most have decided that
the concessions are not enough. In a
letter to the Office of Science and
Technology, Sir Ronald Oxburgh,
Rector of Imperial College, put for-
ward some concerns. He said that
the College "welcomed most warm-
ly" the idea that seven years of
study and training was required
from the start of a first degree to the
award of the PhD.
He went on to say, however, that
the College was "not at all con-
vinced" that the MRes proposal
would "enhance the quality of PhD
training in ways which could not be
achieved within the existing acade-
mic structure".
The Royal Society holds similar
views to the College and instead
want more four-year undergraduate
courses. In the Society's report on
the MRes they commented that
"someone with an MRes was likely
to be labelled a failed PhD".

Students enjoy "the ultimate colour experience ".
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Students took a break from exams
to visit this year's Rag Fete this
Wednesday on the Queen's Lawn.
Various activities were on offer.
By far the most popular was the
Amazin' Colour Maze, an inflatable
labyrinth set up by the charity
Turning Point. One student climb-
ing out of the maze described it as
the "ultimate colour experience".
Meanwhile, Imperial College
Union's (ICU) sabbaticals, current
and future, were being pelted with
wet sponges while they sat in a set
of stocks. Andy Wensley, I C U
President, was the first victim. Jane
Hoyle, Rag Chair, commented how
some students were "eager to have
a go at Andy". Felix Editor, Beccy
Land, also took her seat in the
stocks and described the experience
as "wet".
An IC Radio outside broadcast
and live music from the Jazz and
Rock Club kept students entertained
as they sat on the lawn.
Helen Teesdale, one of the Fete
organisers, said that it had been a
great success. There were, however,
complaints from College adminis-
tration about the noise level, but
this problem was soon "sorted out".
Student comments on the event
were varied: " A distinct lack of ice-
creams," noted one; "just not
enough going on," said another.
Most just soaked up the atmosphere
and enjoyed the sunshine.
Portillo Pelted
BY MIKE INGRAM
Two students have been arrested
after Conservative M P Michael
Portillo's car was pelted with eggs.
Mr Portillo, Chief Secretary to
the Treasury, was speaking to
Conservative students from the
London School of Economics
(LSE) on Monday. The speech took
place in the Royalty Theatre oppo-
site the School. M r Portillo's
speech was frequently interrupted
by loud heckling and shouting from
the crowd, including a cry of "slimy
git". He attempted to calm the heck-
lers down by pointing out their
"privileged" position as students.
The ministerial car in which Mr
Portillo left was pelted with eggs,
though only one actually hit it. Two
members of the Socialist Worker's
Student Society were arrested. One
commented: "It's a bit wrong arrest-
ing us for demonstrating against
ministers who lie about tax rises."
Mr Portillo is the second minis-
ter to encounter the wrath of L S E
students this year. A previous attack
on Education Secretary John Patten
resulted in him being hit by an egg
during a speech.
Friends of IC Lecture
A lecture entitled 'Imperial College
Then and Now' will be given by
Professor Bryan Coles on Thursday
19th May at 6pm. It will be held in
the Clore Lecture Theatre, Huxley.
The lecture is organised by the
Friends of Imperial College. More
information is available from
Eleanor Burke on 081 813 1230. All
are welcome and admission is free.
