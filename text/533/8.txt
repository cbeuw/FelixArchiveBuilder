FILM REVIEW
MONTY PYTHONS
'LIFE OF BRIAN'
By now you will no doubt realise that this is
the title of the long awaited biblical romp from
the Monty Python team, released yesterday
for an exclusive period at the Plaza, Piccadilly
Circus. Set in Judea at around the same time
as the life of Christ, it tells the strange and
previously totally forgotten tale of Brian
Cohen, a Jewish lad living in a Roman
occupied land.
Brian turns out to be the illegitimate son of
a legionnaire (Naughtius Maximus) who at
birth was mistaken for the infant Christ by
three (supposedly) wise men. Well, I suppose
it's an easy mistake to make seeing as Brian
just happened to be born on or around 25
December in a stable, coincidentally situated
in Bethlehem.
T t n main saga begins with the adult Brian
a n d h i s d o m i n e e r i n g m o t h e r M a n d y
witnessing the sermon on the mount.
Unfortunately Mandy would rather go to a
stoning but before they leave Brian spies
Judith, a beautiful revolutionary and member
of the People's Front of Judea (an
organisation dedicated to the overthrow of
the Roman Empire within five months). Upon
discovering his parenthood he joins the P F J
(not, of course, to be confused with the
Judean People's Front) and meets their
leader, Reg. In some hilarious scenes set in a
Roman amphitheatre, Stan (a confused
revolutionary) discusses with Reg his desire
to become a woman and have babies; "But
Stan, y o u haven't got a womb!" exclaims Reg
"where's the foetus gonna gestate then? Are
you gonna put it in a box?" In the mouth of
John Cleese this is some of the finest Python
ever written.
The P F J (not, of course, to be confused
with the Campaign for Free Galilee either)
accept Brian after daubs the slogan, "Romani
ite D o m u m " all over Pontius Pilate's palace.
The Romans are not amused and during
Brian's attempts to escape punishment, he
has several adventures culminating in him
being mistaken once again for the Messiah.
Brian, howe"er, wants none of it. He really
wants Judith and trys to convince the
multitude which follows him that they don't

really need to be told what to do; "You're all
individuals!" he cries. "Yes, we're all
individuals!" two thousand voices echo in
unison.
For those who haven't heard yet the film
has had an amazing reaction in the dear old
USA. Several religious groups have objected
violently to its release and have even formed a
'Citizens Against Brian' group. Personally, I
didn't consider it remotely blasphemous. It is
made very clear that Christ and Brian are two
very different people. Any comparisons made
can only be personal. However, if you hold
very strong religious convictions you may
find the treatment of such things as
c r u c i f i c t i o n offensive, s o be w a r n e d .
Remember you do have the choice of whether
to see it or not. Otherwise I would strongly
recommend this as the funniest film in years.
It's Python at their glorious best - something
which most of you will not want to miss.
