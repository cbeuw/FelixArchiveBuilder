Dear Sir
I feel sufficiently moved by
Merche Clark's innuendo in the
last letters' column of FELIX to
write concerning the vote on the
'taking of the banner' at the last
ICU Council.
The reason I moved that the
banner should not be taken on the
T U C march is that ICU's abortion
policy is a total farce. It consists of
the entirety of Merche's own
motion at last year's A G M and part
of Barry Austin's amendment, the
two being in absolute contra-
diction of each other. Hence, I C U
Abortion policy states, on the one
hand, that we should "instruct the
N H S to treat medical problems of
pregnancy positively and always
act with the intention of saving
both mother and child" and on the
other hand, "we believe that
abortion should be available free
on demand up until the date when
the foetus would be able to survive
independently of the mother."
It d o e s n o t t a k e m u c h
imagination to see that these two
items of policy are mutually
exclusive, leaving aside any
doubts as to when exactly a
foetus/baby would be able to
survive independently of the
mother.
In short, I feel there is an
insufficient basis here to decide
whether we are for or against the
Corrie bill and hence I C U should
I C U BANNER
FELIX BIAS ?
not be represented o n a march
like the T U C ' s until such time as
the policy is clearer.
I have been badly misquoted by
Merche and in fact said no such
thing as "Abortion is a moral
issue" at the C o u n c i l meeting. (I
did, however, say this two days'
later to a certain Ms Atten borough
- c o u l d t h e r e b e s o m e
connection?)
For Ms Clark's instruction, here
is the full text of my speech
against her motion to take the
banner:
7 feel that it would be a
misrepresentation if the ICU
banner were to be taken on this
march. The Corrie Bill is not anti-
abortion in that abortion under
twenty weeks is still not an
offence. I therefore feel that it
would be best to discuss the
matter at a UGM in order to
determine clearly whether we are
for or against the Corrie Bill.'
There is no doubt that Coupcil
did make its decision 'without due
consideration'; there should have
been much more discussion, but I
feel that Merche would have done
better to move one of the many
procedural motions available to
her at the time rather than directly
disobey the ruling of Council and
'swipe' the banner from the Union
Office.

Dear Colin
Reading Philip Cole's attack on
"FELIX bias", I was astonished to
rind that this included the cartoon
on the front page of FELIX, 26
October, "obviously directed
against those opposing the cuts."
As the original author of said
cartoon, I feel obliged now to
explain it to Mr Cole. I suppose I
should apologise for its lacking
clarity. It does in fact support
action against the cuts (I even
drew it whilst in occupation of
SCR). The symbolism of course
being that unless enough is done
we will all eventually get to feel
drastic effects.
I n v i s i b l e a x e : n o n - p u b l i c
proceedings, changes in Tory
manifesto policy, etc, etc. Of
course it is taken to an extreme
case - the whole idea is to shock
people into considering the long
term effects.
I would also like to point out that
the o r i g i n a l w a s d o n a t e d
anonymously to FELIX (I'm not
into ego-tripping myself) and that
I'm not about to start wandering
into any S Hutchings type
hysterical law cases versus Pau'
Williams (who madea better job oi
the drawing anyway, Tal).
My main point of course, is that
Mr Cole might be better listened
to, if he resisted the temptation to
spend four paragraphs slanging
FELIX.
Yours sincerely
