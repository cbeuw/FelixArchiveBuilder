LIFE ON
A
PRECIPICE
So the burly hurly of the Freshers Noshups,
the Occupation, the Rag Mag, John
Shuttleworth and Nervous Breakdowns has
almost abated and the term is now on the
wane.
Rag Week is nearly on us and after that its
Environmental Week, and much much more
(I can hardly wait!).
Which seems like a good time to do a bit of a
review. It is obviously difficult for me to make
comparisons as my perspective is very much
different this year. But I would like to present
one or two slightly contentious observations.
Maybe I was spoiled by a good first year last
year, maybe my C C U spex saw things
differently or maybe this year's freshers aren't
so prepared to get involved or are more
worried about failing in a climate of
decreasing opportunites.
This might explain the reluctance of an
RCS UGM to convict its President in a trial
(unheard of), it might explain the way many
Bernard Sunley House residents haven't even
put their names on their doors, it might
explain the poor numbers of people prepared
to help ENTS and the fact that ICU still needs
a publicity officer (desperate plug).
Please don't take it personally and don't
consider this to be in any way recriminatory,
or if you are one of the people who has thrown
yourself Into the fray don't give up. But do
please review your own involvement in what
can loosely be described as 'college life'.
UGM BLUES
I was very disappointed to see the quorum
challenged by such a narrow margin at the
end of Tuesday's UGM. The fact that there
were only six people short ofthe required 300
and that people left immediately before and
during the count leads me to believe that the
meeting had been quorate during most of the
bulk of the discussion.
It was also unfortunate that the motion
concerning the Education Cuts and ICU's
involvement in yesterday's Day of Action was
not discussed, but I hope that something can
be salvalged at the next meeting.
I was, however, pleased that the John
Shuttleworth claim to the FELIX throne has
finally been buried. I will close that issue by
saying I resent the time I have spent on it that
could have been better used.
So....
1. Keep moving so there's less chance of the
muck sticking.
2. Become a Publicity Officer.
3. Beware of the Fox O'Boyle Rag
(idiosyncratic) Event - it carries an ICU Public
Health warning.
Congrats to Colin on his ratification.

CHRISSYPOOS
THE
BRAIN
DRAIN
VANDALISM
This has suddenly become a major
problem again; within a week we've had a
pinball machine smashed, the pool table
broken into, two lounge chairs broken and
more graffitti on the walls on the third floor.
Now just in case somebody still doesn't
realise my attitude to this sort of behaviour,
I'll explain what happens to people I manage
to catch. The Union Disciplinary Committee
has the power to make people pay for damage
caused, and impose an additional fine, and
suspend them from use of all Union facilities
including clubs and societies) for an
lite length of time, and to refer cases to
College Disciplinary Committee. I do a lot of
work keeping the Union running, and I take a
strong personal dislike to the moronic
wankers who smash things to bits; so much
so that I desire a certain sadistic delight in
Imposing maximum disciplinary measures
against miscreants who get caught.
And as for whoever I catch writing on the
walls, they will be presented with a bucket
and wash leather and an ENTIRE Union
building to clean.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
THEFT
Some money was stolen from clothes left in
the gym changing rooms on Monday evening
between 6:15 and 7:15. Anyone who saw
anyone going into the gym during this period
should contact me as soon as possible.
And if I catch the person responsible, I
don't think I'll bother wjth the disciplinary
procedure; it's easier for me just to mention a
name and department to those members of
Rugby Club whose money was taken.
BARS
Despite a recent price increase from the
brewers, bar prices are being kept down for a
while at least. The only way we can maintain
these prices is if the bars are well patronised,
and our expenses are kept down. This means
it is essential to reduce the loss of glasses
through breakage and theft; glasses are
expensive and each one lost represents a
potential rise in prices.
So HELP CUT COSTS, RETURN THOSE
POTS!
LST
Selling railcards has provided a big boost
to LST this term. Remember, LST is a
student-owned company and exists to
provide a useful service to students, so use it!
