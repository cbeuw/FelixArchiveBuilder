EDITORIAL
Although I have been ratified as Editor, not much
has changed. We still work through the night to
bring you FELIX. I would like to thank Alistair
Lenczner for producing a popular front cover
design. Maz and lan for putting up with my tight
work schedules. Marie-Therese Weech, Margaret
and Jeremy Nunns for paste-ups. Paul Williams who
consistently produces high quality cartoons. Aftab
for helping with all aspects of FELIX and finally
everyone at IC Radio for help with the news.
I wish Anne Nolan best wishes - She leaves Imperial
to-day to work in Exeter.
LATE NEWS: Accomodation is still available in
Lexham Gardens - see Residence Office. Notice to
Overseas Students who are considering leaving
because of the high fees - they only apply to new
students starting in 1980. Don't miss Gay and Terry
Woods ex- Steeleye - Span next Monday (see
What's On).

The masochistic roving reporter
London was quite congested, but there was
at least one traffic policeman at every set of
traffic lights and the veteran cars were just
waved through, rnuch to the annoyance of
motorists in side roads. Despite the weather
there were thousands of people lining the
route.with hardly a stretch of pavement
longer than ten yards without a group of
spectators on it until Coulsdon (about 15
miles from Hyde Park).
South of Coulsdon there were less people
and a little less traffic,although the road was
still full of sightseeing cars and coaches,also
'Tow Cars' (support cars) for the vintage
vehicles. I made one unsuccessful attempt to
phone back to I.C. Radio shortly after B o had
stopped in Streatham due to a knocking noise
from the engine; a faulty inlet valve was
suspected but it turned out to be merely the
bonnet bouncing up and down. A few miles
further on, in Purley, B o made a brief stop to
sort out a problem with the transmission
brake. I got through to Harvey Nadin's
breakfast programme just after that (some of
you may have heard me at 9.35), but as it took
me several minutes I was quite a bit behind B o
at that time.
When I arrived at Redhill (which has got a
very steep hill in the middle of it) I got quite
severe cramp in my legs, but I persevered
because I found out that I was only a couple
of minutes behind Bo. A little later I took a
short cut past Crawley (where the A23 does a
sweep to the west) and rejoined the main road
about ten miles further on. I asked some
spectators if they had seen 'A red car with
people in top hats in it', they replied in the
negative, by which I ascertained that I was
ahead.
Cycling on to the edge of the town district
of Brighton I ensured that I arrived in the town
first. Shortly afterward B o passed ; after
taking some photographs I followed and
arrived at the finish about two minutes after
the G u i l d s veteran m a s c o t , t i r e d but
triumphant.
