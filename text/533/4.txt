REACTION TO THE ZIMBABWE ARTICLE H A M S O C
Dear Jan Czernuska
I felt I had to correct a few
inaccuracies in your article
entitled 'Zimbabwe'. I presume
you in fact mean Zimbabwe-
Rhodesia, but this is a minor
mistake, as is calling Bishop
Muzorewa's party the VANC,
when it is the UANC and has been
for several years. Perhaps a
m i s p r i n t in- the marxist
publications you so obviously get
your information from.
Mass murder by Muzorewa and
his minions? When and where?
The only murderers are Nkomo
and Mugabes' bandits, who kill
any innocent African unfortunate
to be in their way as they rape and
rob across the country.
Floods of refugees into
Mocambique? Your sense of
direction has gone. If you were on
that border you would see groups
of Africans risk death in the
minefields to escape starvation
and 're-education centres' in
Mocambique. And if those were
refugee camps we attacked in the
front line states, why were those
refugees armed and dressed in
camouflage?
Muzorewa was elected by 60%
of the votes cast (in a large
percentage poll) and will be the
victor in any democratic election
as the last one was. He will win
because African politics is tribal
and the Bishop's tribe is by far the
largest. Of course the Patriotic
Front want 50% control of the
transitional committee, by the
time elections come about only
one of them would be left to
contest it, the one who had been
fastest in removing the opposition
and his partner. Rather an
unbiased British Governor and
British peace-keeping force than
a UN force which is not known for
its neutrality.
"Apartheid has not ceased"!
Words fail me, does Jan
Czernuska seriously believe racial
discrimination exists in a country
where the President, the Prime
Minister, most members of
Parliament and 80% of the
securtiy forces are black? Come
on Jan, visit the country before
giving forth in support of a power
hungry mob of gangsters. Who
knows, you might even learn the
truth?
I am a Zimbabwe-Rhodesian.

WHY ONLY POLITICS?
Dear Sir
I feel I must lend my support to
Mr Pearson's letter in last week's
FELIX. ICU seems to have the
policy that IC's reputation for
academic excellence will attract
students no matter how bad other
matters become, hence ICU's
bigwigs can get on with what they
enjoy: messing around with
politics. This seems to be rather
far distant from the basic aims of a
students' union, which are surely
to represent the interests of its
members. If external politics are
only of minority interest, they
should be given only minor
attention.
How about ICU tackling the
food problem? I paid Â£5.50 to go
to a freshers' dinner, but I'm sure I
could have cooked better myself.
How about accommodation?
Having attempted to sleep on
concrete outside the Sherfield
Building while queueing for
Lexham Gardens this year, I am
not convinced that anybody really
wants us to have anywhere to live.
As for Frank James: perhaps he
should do something useful,
rather than writing smart letters
'ILL INFORMED' C A M B O D I A MOTION
Dear Sir
I am writing to correct the ill-
informed motion, preposed by
John Whitehouse on Cambodia,
published in the last Exec News.
The view that the Cambodia
disaster has been caused by the
appalling Pol Pot government is
extremely shortsighted. Like any
other disaster of this nature it has
been caused by prolonged war,
i n s t a b i l i t y and v i o l e n c e
perpetrated most recently by the
nazi-style expansionist aims of
Soviet backed Vietnam. The only
solution for Cambodia is peace,
and this will only come when the
Vietnamese invaders are driven
back to where they belong. There
is every probability that the
present puppet regime of Heng
Sam Rin in Phnom Phen is just as
bad as that of Pol Pot, its blatant
disregard for human life being
demonstrated by its deliberate
expulsion of ethnic Chinese as a
result of which half a million have
drowned at sea.
By recognizing the present
regime we would be falling
straight into the hands of
Vietnamese propaganda. The
recognition issue is totally
irrelevant to that of aid, this being
conclusively by the statement
from Phnom Penh that aid would
now be accepted without strings.
Furthermore recognizing Heng
San Rin would further encourage
the Vietnamese to invade
Thailand, which they already
seem to be considering and thus
spread famine, tragedy and
domination to yet another proud
nation.
While realizing the urgent need
to send aid to Cambodia, we must
attack the Vietnamese aggressors
with every weapon we have, for
their actions, encouraged by the
Soviet Union, are no better than
those of the Nazis. Thus the
government must be encouraged,
not only to send food to
Cambodia and the refugee camps
in Thailand, but also to militarily
strengthen Thailand against
i n v a s i o n and to s u p p o r t
Cambodian freedom fighters, so
that a great nation may rise up and
throw off the conqueror and live
once again.

DO WE WANT EDUCATION?
Dear Colin
As one of the few surviving
members of the Union's Working
Party which looked into the
subject of 'Higher Education in
the 1990s' and as a direct result of
the recent discussions on
education cuts, I believe that a few
relevant facts need to be stated.
The Union's response to the
government discussion docu-
ment basically reaffirmed two
ideas:
1. That everyone with the ability to
progress to Higher Education
should have the opportunity to.
2. That the HE sector should
expand to accommodate the
bulge in university students
predicted to arrive in the late
1980s.
3. The expansion in the HE sector
and subsequent expansion of
facilities should be used after the
bulge has passed on for perhaps
the establishment of more four
year university courses.
At present large members of the
public do not fully appreciate the
effect the present education cuts
will have on the HE sector at a time
when it should be expanding!
We must ask ourselves, and the
rest of the general public, do we
want education or do we want
increase pay packets as a result of
decrease taxation ?

Dear Colin
Perhaps you think I should be
grateful to you for finally printing
something from Hamsoc, but
considering the tooth-grinding
cock-up you put in the last FELIX,
I would have been happier if you
had let it drift into the same limbo
that our freshers article slipped
into. For the scores of students
wondering what I'm going on
about, I'll explain.
Some weeks ago, I wrote an
Amateur Radio Society article
explaining what we're getting up
to this term, and inviting people to
come up and see us. Nothing
unusual, or too obscene, just a
normal sort of 'Societies' article,
in fact. This was given in before
the Monday deadline (inciden-
tally, is it true that the FELIX editor
turns back into a pumpkin after
5:30pm Monday?), yet when, on
the following Friday, I scanned my
FELIX in the hope of a narcissist
thrill at seeing my article in print, I
was disappointed. It seems that
arms were twisted and knuckles
rapped so that the issue was
mainly concerned with the union
occupation. I can only echo P E
Mills' sentiments on that score
and add that I too was fobbed off
with "It'll be in next week."
Next week arrived, with its
double dose of 'Societies' articles.
And just look what you'd done. In
the bottom of the final column you
tacked in an unfinished fragment
of the intended Hamsoc article,
and not the important timetable,
either, just the introduction. What
the hell were you playing at? Had
you lost most of the article? If you
had, surely it must have been
blatantly obvious that the sheet of
paper you had was not the whole
thing, or perhaps the editorial eye
was tired and bleary from
planning these 'foreign assign-
ments' that we've been hearing
about.
Maybe you decided to edit it,
since you were running short of
space. If this was so, wouldn't one
of Steve Marshall's excellent
cartoons have been infinitely
better than the clumsy hatchet job
published?
At any rate, thank you for not
attaching my name to it, but for
the several people who knew who
had written the Hamsoc piece,
please publish this incoherent
tirade, so they can stop thinking,
My God, isn't that Savage
character a git!' or at least go on
thinking so for other reasons than
Strange Behaviour on Elec Eng
Roof. Thank you.
Yours faithfully
