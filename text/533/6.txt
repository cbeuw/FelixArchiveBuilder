MUST FELIX BE TURNED INTO A LITERARY
BATTLEGROUND TO REVIVE OLD GROUSES
Dear Colin
It is tempting to over-react to
Shlomo Godsi's letter. It is
perhaps more tempting not to
write at all - must FELIX be turned
into a literary battleground to
revive old grouses? The sad
fashion in Imperial College Union
this term appears to be for many
of its most able and dedicated
membeis to dissipate their
energies fighting each other - to
the ultimate detriment of the
whole. Things are rapidly
reaching the stage where a
portion of any muck slung at one
sticks, unless one screams one's
innocence as loudly as possible.
Instead, I will apologise. No
member of IC Union who has
made the effort to attend a UGM
should EVER feel that the
Chairman had deprived him or her
of a fair hearing or misjudged the
mood of ihe meeting. Inapro-
priate though I consider this
medium for discussion of such
technicalities, I would bring
to everyone's attention the
existence of Procedural Motion 20
(xiii) - 'a challenge to the
Chairman's Ruling'. I never heard
one on Tuesday 16 October - it is
to be hoped that the majority of
those attending the UGM on that
day felt that I was correct in my
treatment of the procedural
motions I accepted and the one I
rejected. After' all, the act of
acceptance by the Chairman
merely gives the meeting a
chance to decide for itself
(definitions of 'democracy'
become twisted when one feels
those attending the meeting to be
acting 'undemocratically').
Clause nine of the Standing
Orders for ICUGMs states that a
motion, after being proposed,
"shall be open to discussion
subject ot Standing Orders."
Procedural Motion No. 20 (i) is:
that the question now be put'.
Presumably this concludes
'discussion' and that was my
interpretation (as was my right,
and in fact my duty, under
Standing Order 28, even though it
now appears this was at variance
with an addendum to Clause 20 on
Procedural Motions). I quote
Clause 10: "At the termination of
such discussion, the proposer of
the motion or amendment ie Chris
Fox, has the right of reply,
IMMEDIATELY after which the
question shall be put. " Anyway,
as I hope everyone now knows, if
you feel you can helpmechairthe
m e e t i n g . m o r e f a i r l y , t h e
mechanisms exist - be they via
points of order, or information of,
or a challenge to, the Chair.
A g a i n , I a p o l o g i z e for the
technical content of this letter,
and I think it will be appreciated
that, in the midst of this intricate
web of detail, the last thing the
Chairman has time to consider is
his own personal viewpoint.
This brings me to the treatment
of this meeting in FELIX no. 530.
Such sarcastic comments as
"many Miners' bread and butter"
(Apartheid), "off they rushed to
occupy the Senior Dining Room!"
and "magnanimous as ever" (of a
speaker) are hardly consistent
with the aims of factual and
accurate reporting. O n e expects
to find such personal views in
' o p i n i o n ' a r t i c l e s (with t h e
author's name attached) or in
editorials (sadly missing from
that, and previous editions), but
this a p p e a r e d u n d e r ' U G M
Report'!
C o m e on I C U ! Why waste
energy on internal bickering at a
time w h e n B r i t a n n i a must
consider how best to tighten her
girdle (sorry Merche) - after all,
issues now face the Union which
make personal vendettas look
pretty trivial. If a Union of nearly
5,000 members cannot produce
the machinery for reaching
majority decisions (which are
infinitely more important than the
individual opinions of Messrs
Brain, Fox, Godsi or Berry), then
whocould blame an onlookerwho
p r o n o u n c e d t h a t " s e r i o u s
consideration should be given to
its abolition"?
I remain, Sir, defiantly impartial

Dear Colin
Yes the controversy continues! I
do not accept that CCUs are
either tribal' or 'anti-intellectual'
and suggest that one reason why
no one has bothered to answer
these allegations is because they
are totally irrelevant.
CCUs are groups of supposedly
intelligent students and if there is
anything wrong with the CCUs,
then the fault is inherent in the
students and nothing will be
achieved by abolishing CCUs.
I believe that there are two
contributing factors:
1. IC being entirely science based
(in the broadest sense of the
word) lacks the enrichment of
ideas from students studying
more human matters.
2. Due to the fairly high standard
of entry to IC it is probable that
many students will be accepted as
a result of having spent large
amounts of time studying at
school and who will thus have
developed very narrow minds.
I suggest that it is a result of
these influences that CCUs have
developed as they are, almost as
an escape from reality.
If I may be excused the use of a
most distasteful expression I'd
like to say that the letter from
Steve Hutchings got right up my
nose. OK I don't know the facts,
but it seems to me that from the
tone of his letter he appears to be
a power mad prat. Surely a simple
and absolutely trivial matter like
that can be solved without
threats? If not, what hope for the
world?
I'd like to claim the prize for
spotting the deliberate mistake on
page four of last week's FELIX:
MONDAY 04 NOVEMBER for the
copy deadline!
Incidentally, how about a
hitchhike competition to see who
can get the furthest in one day,
anyone interested?
I have the pleasure to be

Dear Sir
The subject of my letter is
'maturity'. Maturity is a wonderful
thing, it should progress at its own
speed, not too fast and not too
slow. There is nothing in this
world as boring as someone who
has 'matured' faster than those
around him, someone who is out
of place, who has matured too
early in life, i am twenty-three
years old, older than the average
undergraduate and I like to think I
am not too mature to have a few
drinks and enjoy myself in a lively
and exuberant manner after the
Dear Colin
In reply to Frank James' reply to
my letter about his first one (this is
getting interesting). He stated that
we were shouting past each other,
but he is the worst offender. I did
not answer his criticisms because
I substantially agreed with them; it
was his conclusions that I thought
were wrong. Certainly, there are
many faults in the C C U s ; but he
appears to be confusing non-
intellectual with anti-intellectual.
My comment was that the 'non-
intellectual' activities of the C C U s
a c t u a l l y h e l p s t u d e n t s to
c o n c e n t r a t e better o n their
'intellectual' activities (such as
d r i n k i n g o r a n g e juice?), by
providing a release from the
stress built up in an average hard
working week.
Mr James, however, has in my
opinion lost touch with the
average student. He is too old and
boring to take seriously, why does
he not realize how mundane his
patronizing attacks on institu-
tions, which keep the rest of us
sane, are, insitutions he is too
estranged to understand. I hope
to be as 'mature' as Mr James
when I am sixty, perhaps.
Yours

pressures of work. None of the
C C U activities are compulsory, so
if an individual feels that they do
not wish to take part in one, or
even any, events then that is their
own personal decision.
Few, if any, of the C C U s ' faults
would be corrected by amalgam-
ating them into a single central
organisation (ie by abolishing
them); further problems would be
created and many of their good
qualities would be lost.
Sincerely
Jeremy Nunns
