Scotland offers an
allÂ°in one experience
Few companies can offer new
Graduates the kind of challenge and
leisure opportunities that make
University life such a highly satisfying
experience. That's why we believe that
a career in Scotland can help bridge the
gap between student and working life.
You couldn't ask for a richer, more
varied experience than that which
Scotland has to offer you. The
picturesque scenery, leisure and
sporting activities and excellent
residential areas all add up to the
perfect setting for enriching the whole
quality of your life.
Cumbernauld, home of one of our
Scottish plants is no exception and
allows easy access to some of the most
breathtaking rural spots in the
country. It is also one of Scotland's
newest towns and, with its emphasis on
building for the future, has created just
the right environment for
implementing our own far-sighted
policies.
The success of these policies, resulting
in the worldwide distribution of such
highly powerful products as the latest
small-scale B80 computer system
designed and developed at
Cumbernauld, has proved to us that
Scotland is the ideal place for
industrial and career growth.
Our continual and generous
expenditure on research and
development together with the
freedom we give our people to be
responsibly creative has led to the
introduction of some of the most
ingenious.design concepts our industry
has ever seen. And as we continue to
expand we need more qualified men
and women with the intelligence and
foresight to maintain our high level of
innovative design.
As part of one of our computer system
and peripheral equipment design
teams you'll be involved in the design
and development of the drive and
control circuitry of a range of inbuilt
peripherals using both analogic and
digital techniques. Y o u ' l l also have the
chance to work on the development of
power supply strategy in small
computer systems.
If you're a graduate with the talent for
generating new ideas and the
experience and skill to make them
work, then we'd like to meet you. Our
salaries are good and conditions of
employment are excellent and include
relocation expenses.
We' re convinced that the combination
of a Scottish way of life and a
progressive career with Burroughs is
one you'll find hard to beat.
