Doubling a marginal contract or showing
one's distribution with a weak hand can give
declarer enough information to make a
difficult contract. Both these points are
displayed in the hand below:

1C was precision (16plus points), while
2NT was unusual (at least 6 points and both
minors) and 3D showed the majors and more
than 8 points. 4D was a cue bid and 5H
showed two aces in reply to 4NT blackwood.
The king of diamonds was led and taken by
the A. Two rounds of trumps showed the 3-1
break.
Declarer was sure that East had most of the
hearts including the queen. The A H was
cashed and the heart finesse successfully
taken. The K H was now cashed followed by
the K C . The fourth heart lost to East's queen
but enabled declarer to discard the losing J D .
East had to concede the remaining tricks.
East's reply to why he had doubled was that
slams with at most 29 points usually go off.
although he was not sure if this applied after
West's bid and his double.
