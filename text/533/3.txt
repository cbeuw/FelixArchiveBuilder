gesticulating wildly. Somewhere in Brixton, a
nasty nocking noise was traced to the bonnet
being loose, but we proceded at a fair pace
although we thought we were slightly down
on power. Finally twenty miles out, we
ground to a halt in a cloud of white smoke and
discovered with no real surprise that the
transmission brake was binding and too hot
to touch. After some of the gentlman
occupents had found relief, we loosened the
brake and set off at a tremendous pace,
making up a lot of time that we had lost.
The huge crowds that usually line the route,
from start to finish were somewhat depleted
by the steadyrain, but one of the pleasures of
the drive was finding time to return the
friendly waves to all the people who found so
much pleasure in seeing us all drive past.
From young children to pensioners, they put
up with the rain and enjoyed themselves.
The final ten miles were somewhat
depressing. We spent a long time sorting out
a bad misfire, and in torrential rain we
crawled along in endless traffic jams, until we
eventually saw the sea. The final hundred
yards along the promenade brought us to the
finish line and a hundred Guildsmen who
collapsed in a heap as the fence gave way.
After a Boomalaka to let Brighton know that
Bo had arrived, we retired, wet and cold, to
the hotel for a pint or three and a slap-up meal
after a journey time of four and three quarter
hours.
Finally, I would like to say a big thank-you
to everyone involved in making Sunday a
memorable day.

M I N E S
After last week's marathon article I've
decided to give you all a rest and make this
one shorter (basically because I'm feeling
bloody lazy).
The Halloween Party came and went,
judging by the state of the J C R it was a great
success.
Last Monday saw the first Min and Met S o c
lecture of the term all those who did turn up
were treated to a very interesting and
amusing talk by the Editorial Director of the
Mining Journal.
The first Rag collection went quite well
despite'the fact that it was pissing with rain.
Star collector was once again J o h n
Macphurson of Mining 1, who collected
£45.491/2.
T O N I G H T there is an A U S S I E B A R N I G H T
in the Union Bar starting at 6pm (or 4:30pm in
the you-know-where, depending on your
personal habits). Wear your Aussie gear.
Many thanks to all those who helped build
the float for the Lord Mayor's Procession,
which will actually take place tomorrow.
By now the film trip to see the Life of Brian
on Monday 12 should be sold out but there
may be one or two tickets left - enquire at the
R S M U Office.
Rag Week starts with a bang on Tuesday 13
with R A G A R A M A , a fete organised by Chaps

IC AMNESTY GROUP
O n Thursday lunchtime (15 Nov)
C o s m o s D e s m o n d , r e c e n t l y
appointed Direcotr of the British
Section of A l , will be coming to
s p e a k at I C . H e w i l l be
concentrating on the situation in
South Africa and in view of the
Union's present confusion and
shameful lack of policy in this
area, I hope that the meeting is
well attended. Cosmos Desmond
first went to South Africa as a
Franciscan Priest in 1959. In 1970,
he published the influential book
'The Discarded People', which
exposed the suffering and death
resulting from the 'resettlement'
program of the South African
government. As a consequence
he was served with a five year
banning and house arrest order
and a year later he was adopted as
a prisoner of conscience by
Amnesty. Mr Desmond is a very
good speaker and I expect that he
will attempt an analysis of the
situation as well as a straight-
forward description.
