NAT WEST BANK
Dear Colin
I read with great interest Mr
W h i t e h o u s e ' s letter" to y o u
drawing attention to the long
w a i t i n g p e r i o d s t h a t he
experiences from time to time in
our branch in the College. As he
quite rightly says, at certain times
our premises are very crowded
indeed and it is a source of
concern to us that we are not able
to provide the speed of service
which we would like.
As Mr Whitehous mentions, we
have introduced a Quick Service
Till and Mail Box, which I
appreciate has not solved the
problem but I do believe they have
made some contribution. As far as
the Mail Box is concerned, it is
n o w the c a s e that s o m e
customers who otherwise would
have waited can deal with their
business immediately.
There are obviously major
p r o b l e m s i n v o l v e d in a n y
extension of the bank's premises
even if the space were available,
but we do believe that we are
taking a real step forward with our
present plans to provide a
Servicetill adjacent to the main
li fts on Level Two as soon as the
Post Office can provide a line and
the necessary preparations have
been made. This will be available
to our customers to provide cash
' a n d a c c e p t i n s t r u c t i o n s for
cheque books and statements on
a twenty-four hour basis. This has
not previously been publicised as
it is unlikely that the work involved
can be completed until well into
1980.
In the meantime perhaps I could
draw attention to the Cash
Dispenser which is situated by the
corridor parallel to that which
leads to the bank premises from
Level One and from which
amounts of ten pounds can be
drawn.
Yours sincerely

MORE RAG MAG
Dear Sir
Has correspondence on one of
IC's more notorious publications
(no, not the Blue Book. That's a
notorious Oxford publication. Or
USAF) been closed, or can I
be stunningly original and fly off
at a tanget from previous
correspondence?
Consider the Rag Mag - here we
have a situation where the Union
could find itself liable in court for
the actions of an individual (if
M a r y W h i t e h o u s e w e r e to
p r o s e c u t e ) , d e s p i t e h a v i n g
strongly opposed those actions.
Sorry, but the Union would find it
hard to disown the Rag Mag.
Now, before Ruth (this is your
mention), Rae, Tansy and other
intellegent young things leap to
my feet, objecting that in future
the Rag Mag Editor will be
answerable - sorry girls, but the
Rag Mag is just one example of
I C U ' s c o n t i n u e d p o l i c y of
m u d d l i n g t h r o u g h o n t h e
assumption that it will all come
clean in the wash, rather than an
isolated abberation. The changes
in Rag Committee structure are
just another example of ICU
bolting the horses after the door -
oh well, you know what I mean;
specific solutions to specific
problems, usually too late. C o m e
on ICU - generalise; after all, the
constitutions remain as full
of loopholes as a sieve (if mixed
metaphors are good enough for
Bill Shakespear(e), who am I to
argue?).
Now, this year ICU is privileged
to have a strong P W P who have
pledged themselves to great
things, not to mention leaping tall
buildings, so how about it, Mxs
Berry, Hepton et al? Why not have
a go at making IC's numerous
constitutions as foolproof as a
duck's eyelid? If you do not see
the need for such action, I am sure
that John Tidy will be pleased to
explain in greater depth. After all
he knows your addresses.
Yours fably

PS - As I recall last year's UK
concert, the 'Walkout' was caused
by an ugly rumour that Brendon
had called last orders, rather than
the group's musical abilities.
FELIX PROBLEMS
Dear Sir
We agree that FELIX has had
more than its fair share of
p r o b l e m s t h i s y e a r . T h i s
doubtless explains why an article
on Jezebel handed into the FELIX
Office beforethe copy deadlineof
the Freshers' FELIX has still not
been printed.
Without the above article
having been seen, we are grateful
for any further publicity which can
be given to the rebuild of Jezebel's
engine.
W e t h e r e f o r e h a d m i x e d
feelings regarding a certain
photograph on page nine of
FELIX no. 532. Its only saving
grace was the caption 'Jez on the
road?'.
Forthose interested, the answer
is N O ! This is a picture of a 1914
machine which is owned by
Dennis Brothers of Guildford.
Yours faithfully

PS - Why no credit for the photo
on the back paqe?
REACTION TO THE ZIMBABWE ARTICLE
Dear Sir
Although I am not at your
college, I had the misfortune to
read a copy of your students i
paper entitled FELIX through a
friend of mine at Imperial. The
paper itself was of admirable
quality, when I came across an
article which struck near to my
heart. I refer to the article by a
c e r t a i n J a n C z e r n u s k a on
Rhodesia-Zimbabwe. The article
was written with such gross and
unbelievable errors, that one can
only suppose it was written from
either sheer ignorance or a
wicked deceiver.
I a m a t h i r d - g e n e r a t i o n
Rhodesian, and as such as much a
Rhodesian as any other man born
in our country. I would like to
point out a few facta as a reply to
this gentleman's fabrications or
trash (is there any other way to
describe the article?).
1. The torture and suffering
brought to the people is to the
most extent caused by callous
and blood thirsty butchers, who
without conscience slaughter
hundreds of innocent men,
women and children of any
colour, creed or religion, to satisfy
their desires. As in the cases of the
family of twenty-three burned to
death while locked in their home,
or of the crashed civilian plane of
w h i c h ten of the eighteen
survivors were fired upon. Ages?
Two girls aged four and eleven,
seven women and one man. After
which not content to admit it as an
accident their gallent leader went
on TV to laugh and snigger at this
bloody affair suffering!
2. Of course over 95% of our
country is under martial law. Most
are when under Seiger from
neighboring countries. We get
wild claims of 'democracy' and
-'justice' from these states, where
they claim their peoples live in
p e a c e a n d h a r m o n y . In
Mozambique there hasn't been an
election since colonial days and
when there will be, only one party
will be able to stand! In Zambia,
the bastion of democracey in the
area, Dr Kaunda eliminates his
opponents by changing consti-
tution to allow no one to stand
against him.
Of course the country is not
perfect, very few are, but if the
peoples inside were allowed to
look after ourselves we'd have one
of the most prosperous and
peaceful states in Africa. Before
people said we were Britains
responsibility, now its accepted,
your judged as biased, where are
all these d o u b l e s t a n d a r d s
coming from? From people and
countries who can least afford to
be examined themselves.
Yours sincerly
