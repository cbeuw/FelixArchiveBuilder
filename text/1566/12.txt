hat’s hard,
metallic and
found down your
pants? Despite
the common
answer to this usually referring to
some sort of recreational, copulation
mimicry device, perhaps owned by a
maternal figure, this time, the answer
may in fact be an anti-viral cream.
A new cream containing silver na-
noparticles is currently being devel-
oped that may control the transmis-
sion of HIV. After previous research
demonstrated that silver particles can
hinder entry of the Human Immuno-
deficiency virus into a cell, the idea to
incorporate it into a cream to ward of
the virus followed shortly after.
Researchers from the University of
Texas have developed a vaginal cream
that once applied, can take effect in
less than a minute and can offer even
offer protection for up to 72 hours.
Not only that, but despite being tar-
geted for vaginal application, because
it effectively inactivates any traces of
HIV, it can also protect any sexual
partners too. It does this by essentially
disarming the way in which the virus
transmits its genetic material, by halt-
ing its transmission through the cervi-
cal mucous membrane.
HIV is a retrovirus; it infects cells
by injecting its own RNA genome into
the target cell. The RNA is then used
to make strands of corresponding
DNA to incorporate into the genome
of the host. This injection of RNA is
only possible if the virus can adhere
correctly to the cell membrane of the
target cell, which for HIV is a subset
of immune cells known as CD4 cells.
CD4 cells can have various func-
tions, but are so-called because of the
glycoprotein on their surface, called
Cluster of Differentiation 4. This sur-
face glycoprotein binds to another on
the HIV surface, called GP120, which
ensures HIV latches on to those im-
mune cells to transfer its precious
RNA cargo.
This is where silver comes in. Silver
nanoparticles act as a microbicide,
and attach to GP120 to block its ad-
herence to other proteins. A novel
feature of this HIV treatment is that
it therefore doesn’t actually act within
the host cell to tackle the virus, but
can stop it in its tracks long before cel-
lular infection.
The cream currently has shown
signs of success when tested on sam-
ples of human tissues, but some issues
still remain. Even if any inflammatory
side effects of creams for such a deli-
cate area are fully overcome, there still
remains the costs of future clinical tri-
als to consider too.
However researchers are hinting
that the cream could be preventive of
the transmission of many other sexu-
ally acquired viruses, like the Human
Papilloma Virus, or even for bacterial
agents that may also be stifled by silver
nanoparticles.
However, the uses of the cream could
outweigh the costs should it prove to
be a success. Not only could the cream
be used as a barrier during sex, but it
could also be applied to gloves to pro-
tect those dealing with contaminated
blood too, or for those in the medical
profession to wear in surgery or clinics
dealing with STI patients.
For now, the cream is still confined
to the laboratory as opposed to the
bedside table. However, it may only be
a matter of time before this life-saving
salve is slathered all over your hands,
delivering not just protection but pos-
sibly a bit of class too: no-one can say
no to some silver lining in thier pants.
