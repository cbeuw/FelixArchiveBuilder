2002 – During the State of the Union address,
George W. Bush officially declares the Y-axis
to be the Axis of Evil.
1959 – The MS Hans Hedtoft – a ship declared
“as unsinkable as the Titanic” – hits an iceberg
and sinks on its maiden voyage.
1933 – In an event now widely regarded as
‘not great’, Hitler is sworn in as Chancellor of
Germany.
1911 – In controversial circumstances, the
Canadian Naval Service unorthodoxly remains
itself to the Royal Canadian Navy
1886 – Karl Benz patents the first gasoline-
driven automobile. However, given that no car
insurance companies existed, he never drove
the thing out of fear of accidents.
1863 – Bear River Massacre. Now we’re
sure this is an extremely sensitive issue, but
we cannot for the life of us work out if this
was the massacre of a lot of bears by a river
or the massacre of a lot of rivers by a bear.
Alternatively, it could’ve been the massacre
of a lot of uncovered rivers – it really isn’t
obvious.
1662 – Oliver Cromwell is exhumed and
ritually executed by King Charles II. It was the
kind of thing that everyone agreed afterwards
was awkward and weird.

“Union In Transition State” - Obama
The President of the United States
of America this week addressed the
USA on a multitude of issues in the
State of the Union address. Whilst
many topics such as inequality
were discussed, Obama was
keen emphasise the fact that the
Union was “in a transition state”.
The President added that, as such,
the Union needed to be stabilised. “As

knows, it’s not easy to catalyse a

at the Grannys award
ceremony in Los

‘Knitted Jumpers of the Year’, your Nan

Whilst the mainstream rewards went
to your Nan, some of the more niche
ones went to your Nan’s friends. ‘Best

elsewhere whilst she received no
nominations in the ‘Baked Goods of

I
celand, Kentish Town -
Followingthenewsthisweekthat
three people are to be prosecuted
for stealing food from bins, this
editor believes that the police
should be going further and arresting
all those who look remotely desperate.
The police must be praised for their
swift action against those work-shy
bastards that were attempting to
procure things that no one wanted for
free.
However, this good work would have
been for nothing if it wasn’t for the
noble zeal with which the Crown
Prosecution Service carried out their
role. Unfortunately, this is but once
incident which should not have been
allowed to happen in the first place.
This writer believes the police should
be given sweeping powers with which
to arrest, detain or otherwise use any
force necessary to stop those who look
desperate.
In fact, not only should police efforts
be doubled, but each and every one of
us should confront anyone who looks
either desperate or poor. Let us never
forget that these people are in an awful
situation because they choose to be
and basically just want your sympathy
and your hard-earned cash.
So, place alarms on your bins, take a
homeless man’s stuff and stop giving
to charity because these people don’t
deserve your time.

this transition state. The President
finished by stating that the whole
address was examinable but that if
you were aiming for a First you’d
need to read around the address.

It is clear to see from this picture why the Y-axis is the
most evil of the axis. I mean look at it, sitting there tall,
proud and fascist. What a bastard.
