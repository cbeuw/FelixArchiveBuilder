FRIDAY 31 JAN
COMMENT
A
t the time of writing,
the Guardian has just
run an online story
about Obama. It
seems he is ready to
bypass congress when it comes to his
2014 agenda. Dan Pfeifer, Obama’s
senior advisor for strategy appears
particularly ‘American’ in the most
pejorative European sense of the
term: ‘We need to show the American
people we can get something done…
the President is not going to tell the
American people he will wait for
Congress.’
Suitably gung-ho for a president
who saw a number of high profile
gun crimes in 2013 and refused to
use the word gun, even in his ‘angry’
and ‘heartfelt’ speech condemning
these err, unspeakable, crimes. But
then something struck me about this
new gung-ho attitude… Where was
it for all the various issues Obama
spoke of that made us-on-the-left
so delighted with the fashionable
young black presidential candidate
five years ago? Where was this single
minded determination when it came
to Guantanamo? Or the healthcare
reforms? Or the economy? I thought
the whole problem was that Obama
was essentially a good guy but
held up by all those blood-sucking
Republicans? Didn’t they shut down
the government last October? If
Obama had the powers of dictator-
elect, why for heaven’s sake (and this is
coming from an atheist), didn’t he use
them then?
Clearly his plans for 2014 were
bigger and better than such minor
issues as stopping (direct) US torture
or somehow making the efficient
private-sector health service in the
US better than Cuba’s. Incidentally in
2011, annual government expenditure
on healthcare amounted to over 17%
of GDP in the US – something like

Writer
Sorry for droning on...
40 times total Cuban GDP, strangled
as it has been for half a century by an
economic embargo. What are these
plans? We will find out in Obama’s
state of the union address on Tuesday
(time of writing is Sunday 26th Jan)
and needless to say I am breathless in
anticipation. Barack the builder, can
we fix it? Yes, we can!
Yet bizarrely enough, there seems
to be a whole host of other things that
Obama has done without the express
approval of congress. No doubt many
in senate would approve of the two
American-backed coups in Honduras
and Paraguay since Obama started
office, and perhaps they even largely
knew about it, but I fail to recall
express approval of any such actions
reported in the press. Similarly, the
assassination of Osama bin Laden
without trial was not something
trumpeted to the world until after the
fact. Who in Senate knew about the
numerous murders in Pakistan and
Yemen in the deliberate campaign
of war waged against farmers and
children and other threats to ‘national
security’. Well everyone, this civilised
practice of modern warfare was
approved in the House. But who
gets to judge exactly who gets, um,
droned? Is there a vote every time a
potential drone candidate is found?
No; Obama has a ‘constitutional’ right
to act as judge, jury and executioner.
For surely, Obama must be acting
constitutionally? We may, err,
disapprove of some of the more
abstract and less appetising moral or
ethical consequences of drone attacks,
such as: is it really fair for soldiers to
be able to kill targets from thousands
of miles away without any risks to
themselves? Is it surprising when
those soldiers, from thousands of
miles away, end up killing the ‘wrong’
people? But, I suppose, as I have
argued before, ethical considerations
are a luxury only affordable to the
comfortable, and we shouldn’t let such
abstract scruples worry us when our
very way of life is at risk from, um,
Islamo-fascist fundamentalist evil
Jew-demon monster people. Have you
not seen Four Lions?
Because, to get back to the point,
Obama, as a trained constitutional
lawyer and recipient of the Nobel
Peace Prize must surely be innocent
of any crime? Would an American
President, the most powerful
individual in the world, knowingly
commit a crime? Nixon knows better:
it is simply ‘impossible’ to commit a
crime as American President because
that’s the way democracy works. You
voted for me so shut-up and quit
whining. For four years I, as American
President, have a God given right to
assassinate, torture, extraordinarily
render, and misabuse the English
language. Since Clinton, I can even
change the meaning of sex.
You see the US, by virtue of being the
US, is allowed to kill people in other
countries without trial. Especially if
they are not white, though the good
men and women (wouldn’t want
to be sexist – American women
have the right to indiscriminately
kill Arabs too!) of the CIA can get
over their scruples if it is a matter
of ‘national security’. These matters
transcend such petty things such as
constitutional rights, as was clearly
shown in the case of Anwar al-Awlaki,
radical Islamist American-Yemeni
Imam suspected of terrorism – though
actual evidence directly linking him to
a terrorist attack is still forthcoming.
Rest assured, he was guilty of thought
crimes – he approved of suicide
bombing – so he was ‘really’ a terrorist,
even if he wasn’t really a terrorist.
I thus presume that Abdulrahman
Al-Awlaki, al-Awlaki’s son killed in a
drone attack two weeks later at the age
of sixteen while eating in a restaurant
with his cousin and friends, was guilty
of blood crimes. That is guilty by
virtue of being the son of his father.
The people criminal justice system
will be glad to have found such a
sure-fire way of making their jobs that
much easier. And don’t worry, even if
there was no official backing from the
Senate, the Senate’s majority leader
assured Candy Crowley on CNN that
sixteen year old Abdulrahman got
what he deserved.
Before I conclude, there are two
things I would like to clarify. Firstly, I
wrote about Abdulrahman and Anwar
al-Awlaki because Jeremy Scahill
has told their story and could do so
because they were American citizens.
Many of the less fortunate, those
born in Pakistan or Yemen, are killed
without so much as the tribute of an
angry journalist, and certainly lack
the exposure of the English language
press. While the news can pick up on
the tragedies that paint a nice picture
about us (the fifteen year old Malala
shot by regressive misogynist Islamist
fundamentalists in Pakistan and saved
in Britain) we are less likely to tell the
stories that see us as the guilty party.
Secondly, would things be better if the
American Senate voted on each drone
attack approved? Or more unlikely, if
the people of America made the same
decision? Do I argue that, while I may
not approve of certain actions made
by the US government they damn well
ought to be democratically approved,
constitutional and legal? No I don’t. I
can’t imagine anything more stupid.
Alas, with the ineluctable passage
of time we have lost the right to
target whomever to those brash
young Americans. May they bear it
responsibly.
