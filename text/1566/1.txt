contributors to the UK economy and our
Universities are central to ensuring that we have
the skills in science, technology, engineering
and maths (STEM) that we need to compete in
the global economy. Big Data technology is one
of the areas where UK universities can take the
lead in research and development and that is
why I welcome today’s announcement of the
collaboration between Imperial and Huawei”
The CEO of of Huawei Enterprise, William
Xu said: “Investing in innovation is central to
Huawei’s business strategy and this exciting
collaboration will help us stay at the cutting edge
of data science developments. Imperial College

in this field. By bringing its experts together
with our engineers we believe we can create new
products and services that will harness the huge
potential of big data.
This collaboration with Imperial also bolsters
the wider partnership programme we have with
British universities, which includes working
with other institutions around the UK on the
5G technologies that will revolutionise how we
communicate in the future.”
