Do you want brains with that?
Anand Jagatia takes a look at prions, the bad behaving proteins

P
rions (rhymes with
“neons”) are really
interesting proteins.
They can also be
very dangerous. The
name is a derivative of the words
“PROtein” and “INfectious”, and
as the etymology suggests, they
cause a group of infectious illnesses,
called “transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies” (TSEs).
Encephalopathies are diseases of the
brain, and spongiform comes from
the fact that over time, tiny holes
appear throughout the cortex of the
victim – just like you’d see in a sponge.
Prion diseases are degenerative
and always fatal. Probably the most
famous example is the bovine variant,
BSE, or “mad cow disease”. The UK
epidemic of the disease, which began
in 1986 and led to a ten year ban on
the selling of British beef, was the
result of feeding cattle the mashed
remains of other slaughtered animals
(including bones, brains and spinal
cords). The feeding practices led to
the spread of prions from infected
to healthy animals and accelerated
transmission of the disease.
Human forms of TSE come in
several varieties. In rare cases,
mutations of the gene for prion
protein may cause disease, but the
majority of the time it is exposure to
infectious prions is to blame. “Kuru”,
a disease endemic to tribal areas of
Papua New Guinea, is probably the
condition with the most gruesome
history – it is believed that the spread
of the disease among the Fore tribe
was due to the cannabilistic funeral
rights practised by its members. The
incidence of infection was found to be
much higher in women and children,
who were generally given the less
desirable body parts to eat, including
the brain, where most of the prion
matter is concentrated.
Misfolded prions are also extremely
stable and can’t be destroyed by heat,
so cooking meat doesn’t prevent
infection. Despite claims of the UK
government during the BSE crisis
that infected beef was completely safe
to eat, there have been 175 reported
cases of the human form of the
disease in the UK since the ban. Most
of these cases are thought to be linked
to consumption of beef infected with
prions.
Scientifically, the puzzling thing
aboutprionsisthewaytheyreplicate.
Not all prions are infectious – the
normal kind is found in many cells
throughout the body, especially the
cell membranes of neurons. But
prions can also exist in a misfolded
state, and this is the kind that leads
to disease.
According to the popular scientific
view, infectious prions can act as a
scaffold for normal prions to misfold
themselves, and this chain reaction
causes the infection to spread
throughout the brain.
Once misfolded prions are formed,
they clump together in big chains
called amyloid fibres, which are toxic
to cells and cause them to die. The
prionhypothesisisstillcontroversial,
because all other infectious agents,
(like viruses) need RNA or DNA
to replicate themselves, but it does
seem that prions can be infectious
without containing any genetic
material.
Todate,therehasbeenlittleheadway
in explaining how all this might
happen. Recently though, scientists
from the Prion Biology Laboratory in
Italy have made promising progress.
Last week, the group published a
paper in the Journal of the American
Chemical Society, outlining how
they used small proteins, called
nanobodies, to stabilise misfolded
prions and then used X-rays to explore
their structure.
For the first time, their research
sheds some light onto the early stages
in the mechanism of prion misfolding,
which might be the first steps to
understanding how these peculiar
proteins are so deadly.
These prions may look pretty, but they can be deadly too
Ancient traces of water found on Mars

or a vehicle designed to
last just 7 earth weeks,
Opportunity has done
remarkably well. Ten years
to the day since the rover
first landed on the surface of Mars,
its new analysis of some of the
oldest rocks ever found there show
environments potentially suitable for
life were around on the planet much
earlier than we previously thought.
The samples, estimated at over
4 billion years old, contained clay
minerals, rich in iron and aluminium,
that suggest the red planet may have
been much warmer and wetter in the
very distant past.
According to the mission’s Deputy
Principal Investigator Ray Arvidson:
“these rocks are older than any we
examined earlier in the mission,
and they reveal more favourable
conditions for microbial life than
any evidence previously examined by
Opportunity.”
Since it landed in a crater on the
Meridiani plains on January 25 2004,
Opportunity has sent 170,000 images
back to earth, alongside data from its
two spectrometers, which can analyse
the chemical composition of soil
and air samples. Its many significant
discoveries include the first meteorite
ever seen on another planet, and soil
layers similar to structures on Earth
that appear to have been caused by
the movement of wind and water in
the distant past. It has also performed
a detailed analysis of the Martian
atmosphere through tracing of argon
gas.
Opportunity has travelled 25 miles
from its original landing site to the
Endeavour crater, where its most
recent results have come from. Its
path has been guided by data from
the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a
NASA satellite that can take highly
detailed photographs of the planet’s
surface.
Opportunity is one of a number
of craft currently analysing the
environment on Mars. Its larger
cousin Curiosity, which landed in
Gale crater in July 2012, has already
made significant discoveries. In
December last year, it encountered
evidence of a huge lake that existed
around 3.5 billion years ago. Much
like Opportunity’s recent discovery,
the water had a neutral pH, and
contained key elements vital for life
on Earth, such as carbon, nitrogen and
phosphorus, potentially making it an
ideal place for microbes to live. The
discovery prompted John Grotzinger,
project scientist for Curiosity, to
describe parts of Mars as “extremely
Earthlike”.
Sofarthough,whilemanypotentially
habitable environments have been
found on the planet, no complex
organic molecules – the building
blocks of life on earth – have yet been
detected. Such a discovery could
provide the first direct suggestion that
some forms of life may have existed
there in the past: one of the key aims
of Mars exploration.
Nobody knows how much longer
Opportunity has left until its systems
begin to stop working. Its twin, Spirit,
which landed around the same time,
stoppedsendingbackinformationfour
years ago. Intense dust storms and
huge temperature fluctuations make
Mars an inhospitable location for any
piece of technology. Many electrical
components have stopped working,
and one of its wheels is broken. But
despite this, Opportunity’s condition
has deteriorated relatively little
recently, and it is fully expected to
keep going for another few years yet.
“There’s more good stuff ahead,” said
Steve Squyres, Opportunity’s principal
investigator. “We’re examining a rock
right in front of the rover that’s unlike
anything we’ve seen before. Mars
keeps surprising us, just like the very
first week of the mission.”
The Mars Opportunity rover has surpassed all expectations
