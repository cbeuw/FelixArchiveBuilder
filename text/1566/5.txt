FRIDAY 31 JAN

F
rench resource company
(and energy giant) Total is
set to invest up to £13 million
in the immediate future in
the fledgling UK Shale Gas
(fracking) industry.
A forty per cent stake of two
exploration licenses in Lincolnshire
will be turned over to the
multinational owned by IGas Energy.
It is the first such investment of its
kind in hydraulic fracturing industry
in the UK. Chief Energy executive
of IGas, Andrew Austin, hailed the
milestone as “a further endorsement
of the potential that exists.” It bolsters
the findings of the British Geological
Survey: 1,300 trillion cubic feet of
shale gas may lie beneath the north of
England. To quote Joe Lynam, a BBC
Business correspondent, a recovery
of ten per cent for a resource this size
could satiate national energy demands
“for almost fifty years.”
Recent developments, however,
have helped reinvigorate the intense
debate centred on the hydraulic
fracturing practice. A balance
between economic profitability and
environmental sustainability has been
advised by many. A significant number
of anti-fracking lobby groups have
evolved to counter the stance of the
Government on fracking. They fear
that any development of the practice
will be uninhibited and will be to the
detriment of environmental and social
well-being, rather than to improving
them.
Developments within political
circles in County Fermanagh serve
as a case in point. Local politicians
have proposed a local referendum on
fracking. Many in the local community
(justifiably) feel that their efforts to
form an opinion on the process are
curtailed by a lack of Governmental
clarity. In the words of a local Sinn
Féin councillor, “one of the things I am
hearing is that people’s voices are not
being heard and decisions are being
taken miles away from where the
actual mechanics of fracking are going
to happen”.
On the other hand many politicians
have hijacked the fracking agenda:
a contentious issue generally
promotes voluminous and continuous
discourse. This, in a way, might
also be construed as a betrayal of
public confidence. Northern Ireland
Minister for Environment Mark
Durkan denounced the Fermanagh
developments in an interview to BBC
Radio Ulster:
“Tourism is the key economic
driver in Fermanagh. What impact
is the virtual rape of the Fermanagh
countryside going to have on tourism
there?”
It is disturbing that a politician
would sensationalise their stance
on a complex issue and lace it with
hyperbole, but it is not surprising.
When viewed in panorama, the
fracking debate is dynamic; and varies
with respect to each locality under
consideration. On the other hand
these localities (and their associated
communities) tap into the wider,
integrated National Grid to obtain
their electricity (excluding Northern
Ireland where an energy pact is

French Energy Giant to Invest in UK Fracking
currently in place).
A July 2013 Ofgem report into the
health of the UK energy sector proved
to be both damning and harrowing.
It believes that spare energy margins
could plummet to as low as 2% by
2015. To put this in the context of a
Domesday scenario, if each household
weretosimultaneouslytriptheirkettle,
major and uniform blackouts could
take place. Ofgem’s Chief Executive,
Andrew Wright, was quick to vocalise
his anxiety: “Britain’s energy industry
is facing an unprecedented challenge
to secure supplies... Preventive action
taken now will help protect consumer
supplies”.
The logical conclusion (on the part
of the Government) is to galvanise
major shifts in the balance of energy
sources. There is already evidence of
real and tangible progress. October
2013 saw George Osborne endorse
Chinese funding in future UK-based
nuclear projects. Within a matter of
days EDF Energy (yet another French
consortium), kept afloat by a sizeable
proportion of Chinese investors,
agreed to development Somerset’s
Hinkley Point C site. While the
developments were encouraging they
are not sufficient in their own right
to remedy the UK’s skewed reliance
on North Sea gas and foreign coal,
oil and gas. It will provide no positive
feedback for the looming date of
2015. Couple this with legal conflicts
concerning the Republic of Ireland
– An Taisce, the National Trust for
Ireland, are considered legal action
over the decision.
“Despite the nuclear power plant
being nearer to the coast of Ireland
than it is to Leeds, the UK decided not
to consult with the Irish public about
the decision before it granted consent
in March,” it said. “The first time many
Irish people learned about the nuclear
power plant proposal was when the
decision was announced.” The UN
Implementation Committee of the
Convention on Environmental Impact
Assessment in a Transboundary
Context have also expressed concern.
Hydraulic fracturing is thus
understandably attractive to a British
Government obligated to ‘keep the
lights on’. A sense of immediacy
surrounds the issue, heightened by the
finite term of the ruling Government:
which, regrettably, when pared back
reveals an ugly truth: pandering to
votes rather than to the higher cause.
Fracking in the United States (which
went from blueprint to production
within a decade) demonstrates that it
can provide rapid energy stability.
The UK Government is not alone
in this. Other nations within the
European Union are equally worried
over long-term security. Instability
in the Middle East has catalysed the
energy agenda (in addition to, one
hopes, the monumental humanitarian
crises in Syria and the surrounding
region).
A joint 2011 paper between
King’s College London and the
European Centre for Energy and
Resource Security put forward some
justifications for the recent fracking
‘gas glut’: “From a global perspective,
unconventional gas has far-reaching
geopolitical implications. It has the
potential to balance the EU’s energy
equation by breaking a market
dominated by a few suppliers.”
It also proceeded to flag the
many emotive issues common to
the communities of Fermanagh and
Balcombe alike.
“Important questions about future
market structure, the regulatory
environment, political risk, investor
confidence...(all)needtobeanswered.”
Its chief insight was the identification
of fracking as a redeeming player
in the energy market. “With local
unconventional gas availability
enabling gas-to-gas competition,
negotiating power is shifting from a
hitherto sellers’ market into a more
balanced and favourable market for
buyers.”
This is an important point. It serves
to unify the chief objections of many
to the practice of Hydraulic Fracturing
in their local environment. The
economic benefits must not become
alienated from their ultimate purpose
(thebettermentofsocietalwell-being).
Germany is a favourable case in point.
Despite each federal State advocating
its own energy policy things appear to
move forward. Perhaps the same logic
might be applied to UK fracking in the
future, taking into account the fully-
fledged economic and environmental
impacts for the higher cause.

F
ollowing an email from the
Rector to staff last week it
has been revealed that parts
of the Chemistry department
will be moved to the Imperial
West campus.
As part of recent study of critical
pathissuesontheentireCollegeestate,
master planners have established
several parts of the South Kensington
campus where space has become an
issue. It was felt that the provisions for
these areas was below what College
aspires to as part of it’s goal to become
a world leading adacemic institution
in the coming years. These buildings
(the Chemistry building, the Blackett
Building and the Huxley building)
have been identified as being on the
“critical path” of the assessment due
to the need of more space for core
academic functions in need of new
facilities that can be solved by new
buildings or refurbishment. It has
been decided that some functions
of departments will probably be
required to relocate to the Imperial
West campus in order to acquire more
space.
The Chemistry Department has
agreed with College Cabinet that
Chemistry has the highest need of
new space due to intensive laboratory
use and requirements and it has been
decided that the need to move some
parts of the Chemistry to facilities
is “pressing”. This has lead to the
creation of a detailed feasibility study
of the possible options, along side
options for refurbishment and future
use of the building.
In response to our online article last
week, the Director of Undergraduate
Studies for Chemistry left the
following comment: “
Of course, this is only the beginning
of a process not the end. I spoke with
Tom (Head of Dept) and Debra (vice-
Provost Education) over the weekend,
the Dept Rep, Catherine Lu, this
morning and intend to meet with all
student reps... to work out how we
involve all Chemistry undergraduates
in the process of planning how
Chemistry undergraduate teaching is
developed at Imperial.”
