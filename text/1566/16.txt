On trains and privatisation
T
his week’s confession is
pretty bad. Most of the
time I enjoy GTAing.
The students are nice and
unusually polite, but in
every class there are always students
you try to avoid. These have been
getting more frequent and must stop
for our sanity. So here are a few you
might recognise:
The Safety Blanket:
These ones which catch GTAs like
spiders in a web. “Could you help me
start this one off?” is normally a sure
sign. Once they snatch you, that’s it,
you are there to the bitter end of a
question. No matter if they are doing
great by themselves, they need the
attention in order to be able to do any
question. Their brains simply cannot
work properly if there is not someone
on hand to sort everything out. The
worst thing about these people is
that they are normally quite good and
their craving need for attention means
other people who really are struggling
miss out.
The Impossible:
These people believe that if
they cannot do the question, it is
impossible. There is absolutely no
point in checking their own work for
mistakes or checking with a friend,
because they are perfect and the
question is wrong. Normally these will
have breezed through any prior work
to a session, because it was easy, but
strangely none of their answers match
those given.
The Question Master:
There is always one in every year.
They are the ones who ask the
questions after a terribly boring
guest lecture, which is useful, as to
be honest, who can think of anything
anyway? But during a marked lab or
demonstration, it is not the time. Keep
these burning questions for after,
everyone else has to pass too.
Confessions of a GTA: Part 9
The Google it:
These are quite often well-meaning
students, who simply are not doing
enough work. They ask politely
about something, but after about five
seconds with them, it dawns on a GTA
they know absolutely nothing about
a subject. The worst of these are the
packs, which fire off question after
question about stuff they should have
done at A level. Thus ‘Google it’ quite
often comes to mind.
The Aggressive/Argumentative:
“I DON’T UNDERSTAND THIS”.
Students like this are the worst. I
admit I met one yesterday and frankly
felt I wasn’t paid enough to deal with
it, so I didn’t. This is an immediate
no brainer for a GTA. Raised voice,
implying the GTA knows nothing or
arguing pointedly with us will send
GTAs running. Good luck with this
tactic.
So please if you recognise yourself
or anyone else, please stop. Even
GTAs have a limit.
T
he British railway system is
the biggest example of the
failures of privatisation. I’m
notoldenoughtoremember
the change, but I’m sure the
arguments were the same as those
touted today for the privatisation of
other well-functioning institutions:
“private companies will run an
efficient service, and competition
with each other will improve that
service while driving down prices.”
This school-level economic argument
hinges on consumer choice, but when
it comes to transport, there is none.
I took the train home for Christmas.
The Virgin Pendolino service got me
there in an impressive two hours;
however, even with a railcard and
booking weeks in advance, it cost over
£50. It was the first non-peak train
of the evening, and was massively
oversold. People were sitting on the
floor, filling the aisles and blocking
the doors. Going to the toilet was
an exercise in jumping over legs and
not treading on fingers. Filling a
lecture theatre to such over-capacity
is dangerous and illegal, but on
transport, it’s seen as business as
usual. Charging for a fast journey
is something I can understand, but
charging an eyewatering amount for
overcrowding is despicable.
My friend who lives in Stoke can
take the same train as me, or a quiet,
cheap one that takes a little longer. I
have no such choice: the Manchester
to London journey, like so many other
commuter routes, is monopolised by
a single company. No competition
to drive down prices, no incentive to
improve services.
Compare the London Underground,
a truly public public transport system,
and to some extent London’s buses,
managed by private contractors,
but with fares and routes set by TfL.
London’s transport is not only faster,
more frequent and more reliable than

other cities’, it’s also far cheaper. Tube
trains may be crowded, but that’s
allowable on a ten minute journey, not
a two hour one. This is no overpriced,
inflated bureaucracy: it’s a world-
class transport system to be proud
of. There’s no reason public inter-city
transit couldn’t be the same.
The naivety of the privatisation
argument doesn’t end with trains,
though: the examples are many. The

GTAs are not there to act as your comforting unicorn blanket.
oligopoly of energy companies raise
prices frequently and in sync with
each other, happily resisting any
political control. What point is there
in having choice, if all the choices are
near-identical?
The NHS is a particularly horrific
case: now that the wide-scale use of
private contractors is in its remit,
it is subject to competition laws:
hospitals have been prevented from
merging; neighbouring NHS Trusts
are forbidden from sharing resources;
GP practices have been reprimanded
for giving treatments to patients
themselves rather than referring them
to private clinics. This, all in the name
of supposedly service-improving
competition, and at great detriment to
us, its patients.
Transport, energy and healthcare
are all essential public services, the
provision of which is completely at
odds with the profit-driven nature of
privatisation. Public services have no
obligation to make a profit, nor do
they need competition: they should
be accountable to government,
and ultimately to the public, not to
shareholders. Unfortunately, with
nationalisation being a dirty word
to all of our major political parties,
overcrowded trains and crumbling
healthcare will be the norm for the
foreseeable future.
