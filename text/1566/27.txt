The Hunger Games: Catching Fire
CatchingFireseesthenextinstallment
of the mega hit adaption of Suzanne
Collins’ bestselling Young Adult series
starring Jennifer Lawrence et al.
We start off back at District 12,
looking as decrepit as ever. Katniss
(J Law) is still traumatized from her
experiences in the arena and rightly
so, as she was both forced to kill and
to watch as friends died in her arms.
Before she has any time to reflect
and properly grieve, she’s whisked
off with fake bf Peeta on a victory
tour of the other districts to spout
Capitol propaganda in order to quell
the growing insurrection against the
brutal, autocratic government of
President Snow. When this inevitably
fails, ruthless Snow has one more
drastic idea planned to wrestle
back control: he decides to reap the
contestants for the next Hunger
Games from the pool of existing
victors, meaning Katniss and Peeta
once again enter the blood-stained
battle arena.
Catching Fire is a superior
blockbuster not only because of its
pulsating, thrilling action sequences
but also because of the strength of its
characters and its allegorical premise
which is strikingly current. Best in
show as usual is Jennifer Lawrence,
although her Katniss is self-reliant
and often stoic, her eyes betray the
horror of her situation and her will to
survive.

Even those with an entirely under-
standable objection to Hollywood’s
never-ending, contrived war films
ramming American patriotism down
everyone’s throats should check out
Peter Berg’s latest modern day mili-
tary drama. It is turning out to be
one of the more financially successful
contemporary war films, after the less
than stellar efforts of The Kingdom,
The Hurt Locker, Rendition, In the Val-
ley of Elah, The Messenger amongst
others.
Lone Survivor has a broad range of
appeal. It is an intense, action-packed
vehicle that goes above and beyond,
giving its audience a lot more than the
expected material. The set-up is sim-
ple: after a montage of United States
Navy SEALs being put through all
sorts of tough, gruelling army training
to be turned into the toughest fight-
ers, we see four SEALs embarking on
a recon mission to capture and kill a
notoriously violent Taliban leader.
There is a fair amount of build-up
before the four are dropped into the
Afghan wilderness. Marcus Luttrell
(Mark Wahlberg), Michael Murphy
(Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile
Hirsch), and Matthew Axelson (Ben
Foster) clearly share a tight bond and
even within the relatively brief scenes
designated to develop each character,
the writing ensures that they all stand
out within the group, all of them with
their own individual strengths to con-
tribute to the unit as a whole.
Their mission should have been a
simple one, and yet a chance encoun-
ter threatens to unravel the entire op-
eration. The unit encounters harmless
goat herders from the village where
their target is hiding out. Do they kill
these unarmed civilians to not jeop-
ardise their mission? Do they let them
all go in accordance to the Rules of
Engagement and morality in combat?
There is intense debate between the
four of them, as there no doubt would
be some heated argument amongst
audience members too, but in the end
the prisoners are set free, which trig-
gers deadly consequences.
With the Taliban alerted, the four
have no choice but to retreat and call
for back-up. But military support is
virtually impossible when their com-
munications equipment fails to work
in the harsh, wild terrains. Ultimately
they are left to fend for themselves;
heavily outnumbered and disadvan-
taged, about to face the never-ending,
relentless action scenes of hardcore,
adrenaline-fuelled combat.
It starts off simply and swimmingly
enough for the Americans, with their
high-tech weapons loaded and pick-
ing off one bad guy at a time, but
soon they are forced to take cover and
start jumping into rocks and valleys
to escape the incoming hail of bul-
lets. Every loud horrific thud, crush,
crunch and bang plays a huge part in
portraying an intimate, horrendously
realistic, tense, continuous scene of
unflinching bloody, gore-filled action
that never holds back.
When people are shot, we see the
wounds. There is a lot of blood, torn
flesh, and even some sustained looks
at the injuries too. When there are
broken bones, they stick out and cause
immense pain. There is nothing neat
or slick about how the action devel-
ops, and the film is all the better for it.
As the title suggests, there are
deaths, a lot of them dragged out and
given the slow-motion treatment to
bring out the tragedy. Possibly the
only moments where the film slows
down, they provide much-needed
breathing space from the fierce, un-
yielding shoot-outs.
Is the film pro-American? Why not.
But the film tries its hardest to hold
back on that. It’s not an unbiased film
by any means, but it at least steers
clear from overly glorified heroism.
Pro-military? Sure. But it’s more than
that. It’s pro-humanity. Pro-camarade-
rie and brotherhood. These men were
brothers in arms, they were trained to
never give up under any circumstanc-
es and yes it does sound corny, but
given the time we have spent with the
soldiers over the past couple of hours,
the personal angle the film strives to
achieve is not only commendable but
highly worthwhile.
Performance-wise, the four men are
outstanding. Particularly impressive
is Foster who, covered in all sorts of
cuts, bruises and wounds, brings out
more energy and ferocity as the film
carries on.
It’s incredibly well-structured, and
from start to finish by focussing on
the tough challenges these men face,
there is an enormous sense of authen-
tic excitement that lasts the whole way
through.
