FASHION
A little something for the boys
The banker stlye is back again. Time to get rid of your topman gear
and channel your inner Patrick Bateman.

In the office
Look smart in the office (or at that job interview)
in a pinstripe suit. Team it with a basic white
shirt and statement tie and people will start mis-
taking you for Gordon Gekko in no time.
Casual drinks
The art behind a smart casual look is all in light
colours. Team some casual chino’s with a light col-
oured blazer and you’ll look like you belong in a
Ralph Lauren ad in no time.
Tuxedo time
Every aspiring, dapper man needs to have a tux-
edo in his closet for the numerous dinners and
parties he’ll be going to for corporate functions.
If you’re running low on cash for your usual Boss
tuxedo, have no fear! M&S offer great reasonably
priced options.
I
f you’re like most people who love the
cinema, you’ve probably seen the Wolf
of Wall street by now. Most girls I’ve
spoken to thought it was shocking yet so
entertaining, but when I talk to guys about
it they say they they’re absolutely mad about it.
They WANT to be Jordan Belfort and live that
raucous plane orgy, cocaine snorting, prostitute
ringing exhuberant lifestyle that he did. Well,
I can’t teach you how to become a billionaire
banker wanker, but I can certainly show you how
to dress like one.

The shoe makes
the man
These black dress shoes are a multi purpose
winner and can be worn for a formal work set-
ting, pesky assessment centres, fancy dinners,
parties, and for post work cocktails. Invest in
a good quality pair and you wont regret it be-
cause you’ll be wearing them all the time! A top
tip would be to keep them polished and looking
shiny whenever you wear them. Leather polish
is relatively inexpensive but makes shoes look
brand new everytime you theyir worn.
