Man City v Chelsea
(Sky Sports 1, Monday 8pm)
What a platform for one of these
two frontrunners in the title race to
lay down the gauntlet and send out a
real warning to their title rivals. Man
City will be favourites, and rightly so,
but, they are far from rock solid at the
back, whereas you can bet Jose Mour-
inho will not stand for any defensive
mistakes. The more experienced of the
two managers, Mourinho has success-
fully played for a 0-0 at both Arsenal
and Man United already this season.
I expect him to do the same on Mon-
day and, while he will do well to keep
a clean sheet with the likes of Sergio
Aguero et al on the pitch, I do think
Man City will struggle to outscore the
Blues.
1-1
Newcastle v Sunderland
(BT Sport 1, Saturday 12:45pm)
It seems an eternity ago that Paolo di
Canio announced his arrival at Sun-
derland with an emphatic 3-0 win in
the corresponding Tyne-Wear derby
last season. Since then Gus Poyet has
steadied the ship, and Sunderland have
not lost on the road in the league since
November. High-flying Newcastle’s
French contingent will provide a stern
test of their defensive credentials. On
paper, the Magpies are stronger in
every department, but with precious
little to play for, the Black Cats can
extend their run of away form with a
valuable point.
1-1
West Brom v Liverpool
(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 1:30pm)
The Baggies had to fight hard to hold
Everton in Pepe Mel’s first outing in
charge, but for all their attractive play,
the Toffees do not possess the same
clinical cutting edge in attack as their
Merseyside neighbours. The lethal Su-
arez-Sturridge partnership is back in
business and although Mel will try to
frustrate the Reds, Brendan Rodgers’
side need a win to stay on course for a
top-four finish. That incentive should
make it a comfortable afternoon for
Liverpool. Rather like Man City, you
always feel Liverpool can outscore any
opponent.
1-3
Arsenal v Crystal Palace
(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 4pm)
The Gunners keep rolling on, and
have made a nice habit of cruising to
2-0 wins in recent home ties against
the likes of Hull, Fulham and Car-
diff. They know at least one of Man
City and Chelsea will drop points this
weekend too.
2-0
West Ham v Swansea
Make no mistake, this is a relegation
six-pointer. For all their slick passing,
you could argue the Swans have been
off song for a year now. The Hammers
have not won at home since the open-
ing day, but with Andy Carroll back fit,
this is a great opportunity.
2-0
Cardiff v Norwich
This is another massive game at the
wrong end of the table, but Ole Gun-
nar Solksjaer will be hungry for a first
home win after an embarrassing home
reverse to West Ham. Chris Hughton’s
Canaries do not win away often, espe-
cially when the pressure is not really
on
1-0
Everton v Aston Villa
It is always dangerous to back against
Villa away – they showed yet again at
Anfield that they are a different animal
on their travels. But the Toffees are in
with a real fighting chance of a Euro-
pean finish so Roberto Martinez will
demand nothing less than a win.
2-1
Fulham v Southampton
The Saints are in a bit of turmoil at the
moment but do not seem to be letting
the off-field troubles affect their per-
formances on the pitch. The Cottag-
ers will have targeted this as a must-
win match but they are just not in the
same league for me
1-2
Chelsea vs. West Ham
(Wednesday 7:45pm)
Tim Sherwood’s Spurs are in fine form
and even the very well-organised Ti-
gers will have their work cut out try-
ing to contain Emmanuel Adebayor
and co. Spurs have to keep winning to
remain in contention for the top four,
and should prevail over the 90 min-
utes.
0-2
Stoke v Man United
You don’t really know what you are
going to get with Man United these
days. Some weekends they pick up
routine wins, others they slip to hor-
ror defeats. Although their record at
the Britannia is decent, Mark Hughes
has already claimed a few scalps there
since taking over.
1-1
James White gives his midweek predictions
A
fter the initial blinding
from the blonde hair
and the fake tans, we
collected as a team.
RomVom slotted in a
quickie, smoothly followed by a mid
air bitch slap into the net from 3 x a
Fish, and we pulled ahead. Some great
defending protected Fresher Wearing
III from the formidable Jacky Essex
with FrauBrau and Fresher Brave
pushing hard up the right (shaft).
Double Decker and Fresher Me scared
them away from our D with their very
real hair…
Suffering from a bad bout of hat
trick avoidance and ably assisted by
Shark Bait (ooh ha ha) 3 x scored
again.
Dominating in the first half, we
gave them a charity goal, cos ya know,
they’re from Essex. Some great one-
two’s, aerials, drag flicks and general
reem tekers from the solid centre
playaz U Bender, WC and Tenth Hole
led to a 3-1 half time score line.
Some rousing chat from Banana
Split and Willy Board direction
from Reginald Maximilian Tarquin
Clarence “Pete” Duke of Egham,
encouraged some great all round work
in the second half.
They were well jel though, and
OMG, copied our stick and ball
handling skills to get a second in.
Despite their dazzling vajazzling, old
hats Sucky Sucky and Herpes held the
line. Final whistle babes. Game over.

I
t’s been a big year for I.C.
Wing Chun. We’ve joined
the UK Wing Chun Kung Fu
Association (UKWCKFA), a
leading association for Wing
Chun with links across the country
and the world. Imperial students now
have the opportunity to train with
Sifus from Britain’s leading VTTA
approved association; headed by Sifu
James Sinclair, who has impressive
experience.
Our new Sifu, Nick Martin, will be
joining on Feb 7. He is currently giving
Wing Chun seminars across India.
We’re extremely excited as a club for
the new talent and energy Sifu Nick
will bring. We’d like to welcome any
new members to come down and join
us for a free taster session on Feb 7;
his very first session with I.C. Wing
Chun. This will run from 6pm-8pm in
Activity Space 2 in the Union Building.
As well as high class training,
joining the UKWCKFA also means
our members can use associated
clubs across the country. This means
training can continue throughout the
holidays.
We strongly believe in giving our
members the best training available,
and fostering a fun and friendly
environment as a whole. One of our
most recent achievements has been
taking our members to perform in
the Victoria and Albert Museum
along with the CSSA for Chinese New
Year Celebrations. We want to keep
creating fantastic opportunities like
this to improve skill, confidence, and
control.
Come down and check us out! You
can contact us via wingchun@ic.ac.
uk or search I.C. Wing Chun Union
on Facebook. Everybody is welcome,
whether you’ve done martial arts
before or if this is your first time. We
look forward to seeing you!

What happened
between ICUFC
and St. Georges?
T
his week’s football report,
while hilarious has been
independently banned by 12
countries, each citing rules
about indecency, too much
punnage and too many embarassing
confessions about private viewing
habits.
So, tune in next week when we hear
from the team again, hopefully after
they’ve had a cold shower!
