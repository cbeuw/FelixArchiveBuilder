A
n Australian man has
admitted causing the
death of two men,
one of whom was
the Imperial College
researcher Dr Sean Barrett, by
dangerous driving.
Dr Barrett, 36, had travelled to
the West Australian city of Perth on
October 16 2012 to attend a quantum
physics conference but was in the
country for less than an hour when the
taxi he was in was hit by a speeding
4x4. Dr Barrett and his driver, Kuldeep
Singh, 28, died instantly.
Speaking in the Supreme Court of
Western Australia last week Prosecu-
tor Therese Austin outlined how An-
thony Fogarty, 24, had led the police
on a high speed chase around Perth
in the 4x4, which had been reported
stolen several days previously. Mr
Fogarty, who has never held a driving
license, was clocked at speeds of up
170km/h (105mph). The ground pur-
suit was eventually called off to reduce
danger to the public. However, a police
helicopter observed the car running a
red light on Orrong Road and hitting
the taxi. Subsequent tests showed that
Mr Fogarty had high levels of cannabis
and amphetamines in his blood.
While Fogarty, who escaped from
the crash with only a broken leg, ini-
tially denied being the driver he was
overheard in prison admitting to his
guilt. In a court sitting on 21 Janu-
ary of this year he pleaded guilty to
the charges against him, saying: “I
just want to apologise to the families.
I know sorry won’t bring them back,
but I still want to let them know I am
sorry.”
Dr Barrett had studied at Cambridge
University for his undergraduate and
postgraduate degree. His doctoral
work was on quantum information
processing in a condensed matter
system. He moved on to a junior posi-

death of Imperial researcher
tion at HP Labs in Bristol, eventually
returned to Imperial College London
where he held the Royal Society Uni-
versity Research Fellowship. At the
time of the accident, he had been lec-
turing for one year.
A statement from Imperial College
praised Dr Barrett’s research, adding:
“His loss will be greatly felt by the
scientific community. Our thoughts
and condolences are with Dr Barrett’s
family, friends and colleagues at this
tragic time.” Speaking to the Man-
chester Evening News, his mother, Jan
Barrett, described her great loss say-
ing: “Everybody absolutely loved him
and had great respect for the work he
was doing. He would have gone on to
do more great things.”
Speaking of the incident, Ms Austin
said: “This is a case in the very worst
category – he drove intoxicated, at
excessive speeds through suburban
streets, in gross contravention of traf-
fic laws, whilst evading police with no
intention to stop”. Fogarty will be sen-
tenced next month.

Imperial academics on list of
top UK practising scientists
T
wo Imperial College
researchers have been
placed on list of 100
top practising scientists
compiled by the Science
Council. Professor Michelle
Dougherty and Dr Ahmer Wadee
join other well known scientists on
the list, including Lord Martin Reese,
Sir Paul Nurse and Dame Jocelyn Bell
Burnell.
Professor Dougherty’s citation
praises“herleadershipinspacescience
as team leader on the magnetometer
instrument aboard the NASA-ESA
Cassini Mission to the Saturn System
and ... her contribution to encourage
young women into science”. Professor
Dougherty has been responsible for
world leading research on Saturn’s
moon, Ganymede, and was named a
Fellow of the Royal Society in April
2012.
Dr Wadee, of the Civil and
Environmental Engineering
Deparmtent, was praised for “his
research in the field of nonlinear

mechanics of structural stability,
primarily involving modelling
buckling instabilities in metallic and
composite material structures”.
The Science Council was formed
by a Royal Charter in 2003 with the
aim of promoting both research and
popular engagement with science.
Diana Garnham, chief executive of
the Council, said that she hoped the
list would serve to raise the profile of
scientists who are normally ignored
by the media. She added: “we must ...
recognise and encourage the many ...
types of contributory scientific talent
and experience”.

Changes to
Alcohol Policy for
Varsity 2014
Tube strikes to
cause chaos in
February
Joe Letts

I
mperial’s Sports Partnership
has recently sent an email to
stakeholder of the annual Varsity
match outlining changes to the
acceptance of alcohol during the
event.
The declared Varsity Day Alcohol
Policy affirms that the focus of the
Varsity event should be on “sporting
competition”. The email cited a
significant number of incidents
related to alcohol consumption and
how they were inappropriate at a
sporting competition.
In preparation for Varsity 2014
several changes have been put in place
which will affect the use of alcohol
during the day including:”
Alcohol can no longer be taken onto
coaches.
Participants and spectators will be
unable to carry externally purchased
alcohol onto College/Union/The
Stoop owned premises.
Any personal supply of alcohol
found on said premises will be
confiscated.
People who are judged to be overly
intoxicated by Harlequins security
will not be given permission to enter
The Stoop.”
T
ransport for London have
announced that next week
there will be disruption to
underground travel. On
Wednesday 5 February and
Thursday 6 February walkouts are
expected. Services will be affected
from as early as 21.30hrs on February
4 so don’t get caught out.
Talks to avert the strikes are being
held. However, TfL have devised
a strategy to keep London moving
should the industrial action go ahead.
Extra buses will be laid on, and
‘ambassadors’ will endeavour to keep
Tube stations open, providing travel
advice and information as necessary.
TfL advises that Tube services will
finish early on Tuesday evening so
customers are urged to complete their
journey as early as possible. Tube
services are expected to return to
normal on Friday morning.
