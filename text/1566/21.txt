FRIDAY 31 JAN
ARTS
AMAZING, IN CAPITAL LETTERS
A
s I sat down in my plush
theatre seat, tucking my
kiddy school bag under
my legs, I suddenly felt
very small. Everything
about the evening ahead of me
seemed designed to dwarf me: the
cavernous Olivier theatre, the word
famous director Sam Mendes of
American Beauty fame, the BAFTA
winning Simon Russell Beale in the
main role and, of course, the play
itself- King Lear. More than 400 years
old, it has been performed in all the
major theatres on the globe and has
been interpreted by the greatest
actors in Britain, both on stage and
on screen.
So it was with trepidation that I
leant back in my seat for the three
hour performance. And, almost
immediately, I forgot my qualms as I
became enveloped in a complex, dark
and captivating world.
For those of you who are struggling
to remember which of the many
Shakespeare plays King Lear is let me
give you a quick lowdown. Lear, King
of Britain, is getting old so decides to
divide his kingdom between his three
daughters based on how much they
love him.
The eldest two (think Ugly Sisters
from Cinderella) start proclaiming
their love, while Cordelia, the
youngest, answers honestly but with
no exaggerations, stating that she
loves him as a daughter. Lear gets
angry, disowns Cordelia and send
her off, penniless, to marry the king
of France. The Ugly Sisters pop
off to enjoy their new kingdoms,
refusing to host their dad and all his
rowdy knights. Lear’s slightly losing
the plot by now so he strops around
having fights with everyone and
ends up falling out with all three of
his daughters and many of his close
friends. Not good. Add to this a side-
plot of the Earl of Gloucester being
tricked into disowning his son on
the advice of his illegitimate son and
you’ve got quite a lot to be going on
with.
The beauty of this production is
that at no point you’ll be scratching
your head wondering who’s who and
what is actually happening. Mendes
has created a seamless production- a
perfect production. The stage set is
minimal but effective, creating a dark
world which gradually disintegrates
under civil and international war.
Playing on the strong 20th century
imagery of refugees and military
dictatorships, stage designer Anthony
Ward uses the vast Olivier theatre
to its full potential, with groups
of soldiers and civilians tramping
around wearily with suitcase and
sleeping bags throughout the
performance, helicopters and military
planes roaring overhead.
The cast is amazing. Am I allowed to
use capitals for that? It’s AMAZING.
It’s so rare to see a cast in which every
single character is strong and real
and doesn’t over dominate the stage.
Russell Beale is an outstanding Lear:
despotic in his military, unpredictable
manner but touching in his self-aware
ageing. He creates a Lear that we can
all relate to, the dementia ridden old
man, refusing to give in to his age.
But Mendes again works his
magic by making this production a
snapshot of life, rather than a play
about a man. You will witness the
unravelling of a State, a court and
a family, with the effects this has on
every person involved. And in the
three hours betrayal, madness, age,
loss, poverty and homelessness will
dominate the stage, with faithfulness,
filial love and forgiveness fleetingly
counterbalancing the scenes.
From its origins, this is what theatre
has been all about. Bringing life, a
life you cannot or might not want to
experience, to a place where you can
do so fleetingly - the stage.
Here you’ll experience a dark, war-
revenged, gory world full of death
and betrayal but you will experience
it so incredibly vividly that as you
make your way along the South Bank
on leaving the theatre you’ll blink,
amazed, at the happy, shiny London
that meets your eyes.

W
ith the latest
revelation from
Thomas Hitzl-
sperger, and Tom
Daley’s recent
announcement that he is in a gay re-
lationship, the topic of high profile
sportsman and homosexuality is cur-
rently much discussed. This new play
by John Donnelly is set over a 12 year
period of a professional footballer
Jason’s career. It begins on the even-
ing before his first appearance for the
team, sharing a hotel room with a fel-
low debutant and friend Ade. Their
relationship is perhaps something
more than just friends and team-
mates. A few years later, at the height
of Jason’s footballing fame and suc-
cess, he spends an evening with a ta-
ble dancer in a hotel room with dubi-
ous intentions. In the final act, Jason
invites Ade to catch up in his hotel
room where he is living, having sepa-
rated from his wife. By then, his star
has waned and he is battling with
injuries, looking for a club that will
take him for a final season or two.
At first instance, it can be seen as a
play about a gay footballer having to
conform to a heterosexual footballer
stereotype, ending up being dissat-
isfied about his life despite his foot-
balling achievements. But the play
covers a wider scope and looks much
deeper at the role of money and suc-
cess, especially how it enables one to
control and manipulate the media
and those around.
The play explicitly draws on the ex-
ample of Jimmy Savile as to the ex-
tent of the appalling behaviour which
some of the rich and famous get away
with. All these are handled in the
play with great skill, mixing subtle
look and gesture with overt excess
in confrontations and debauchery.
Although the writing occasionally
wanders and becomes distracted
with details, it soon snaps back to its
core message and story.
The direction by John Tiffany in-
corporates his usual choreographed
scene changes performed to music
with a heavy beat. The arrangement
of the audience on the opposite sides
of the central stage alludes to a foot-
ball stadium, and provides some
interesting possibilities for the au-
dience to choose their focus when
performers are on either end.
The choice is not always an easy
one with the excellent cast. Russell
Tovey is outstanding as Jason, man-
aging to convince as the youngster
full of innocence and optimism in
the first scene. It is also played with
suggestions of thoughtfulness that
enable him to transform believably
into this calculating and cold mon-
ster in the subsequent acts. Gary
Carr’s Ade is understated and mel-
lows as years go by. Lisa McGrillis
plays the WAG type dancer with a
mix of strength and vulnerability
and at the same time, holding onto
a degree of dignity. Nico Mirallegro
stands-out playing the smaller role as
the off duty hotel worker Harry, join-
ing in with Jason’s excesses. Miralle-
gro’s story of a stag party in Krakow
is beautifully delivered.
This is a thoughtful look of modern
celebrity culture and observations on
the topical subject about machismo
of sport. It is delivered with wit and
craft, with a good dose of danger and
tension.
