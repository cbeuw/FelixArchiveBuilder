Gemcraft: What a gem!
Gemcraft Labyrinth is the 3rd Chap-
ter of the epic tower defense series of
GemcraftfromGameInaBottle.Gem-
craft Labyrinth offers a deep gameplay
with its combination of strategy and
RPG elements making it easily one of
the best tower defense games of 2013.
The basic gameplay of Labyrinth
remains the same as the Gemcraft
series: Monsters of various types
will approach the orb on the map by
means of meandering pathways, and
it is the gamer’s job to place gems
in strategic locations to try to de-
stroy them before they reach the orb.
Monsters reach your orb and dam-
age your mana by varying amounts.
If your mana falls to zero, you lose the
game. Your mana slowly replenishes
over time and you with every kill and
mana are also the currency to pur-
chase and upgrade towers and gems
and many other traps and advantages.
Having a lot of mana will make you
withstand a lot of attacks but every
so often a large monster will appear
that can crush your orb altogether.
The crux and strategy of the game,
as the title suggests, is with the gems.
There are eight different coloured
gems each hue with distinct special
ability in addition to their attack points
some of which include slowing down
enemies, creating chain hits and re-
ducing enemy armour. Gems can be
combined, combining the hues and
retaining a portion of the special abili-
ties from each gem. While most stages
only give you a few colours to use, you
can actually combine gems to increase
their potency and give them new
abilities. You can stick with the gems
the level gives you to begin with and
think strategically, or you can spend
mana to instantly unlock any colour
you wish for the duration of the level.
Gems can be upgraded to increase
attack speed, attack damage and at-
tack radius, and upgrading the gems
brings about a different shape gem.
A new addition to the labyrinth
chapter is the ‘apparition’. These are
rare innocuous beings that sporadi-
cally appear on a few maps that fly into
and out of your view during the game.
Destroying apparitions gives you up-
grade points directly. Upgrade points
can be used to acquire advantages
that last through the entire game such
as increasing your mana pool at the
start of every game or increasing the
potency and special abilities of gems.
Gemcraft Labyrinth is entirely meri-
tocratic, you can adjust the difficulty
of the game on each map which gives
you extra XP points after you complete
it which convert to upgrade points.
Gemcraft Labyrinth is a must-get
game for Tower defense game lovers
and can be played for free on Armor-
games and Kongregate. Game In a Bot-

Time to pack out Braid
Indie Game the Movie is a great film
for games fans. It follows the creation
and reception of 3 Indie Games; Su-
per Meat Boy, Fez and Braid. I already
had played a lot of Super Meat Boy,
and soon after the movie I caught Fez
in a humble bundle. These were some
of the best games I’ve ever played and
were instant favourites of mine so it
is of no surprise that once I finally
caught Braid on sale it instantly fol-
lowed its predecessors into my top 10.
Braid is a puzzle game created by Jon-
athan Blow. The film had showcased
how much time and effort he put
into making this game and the fin-
ished result echoes this. Visually the
game is stunning! Braid showcases a
unique art style that I would describe
as artistic Mario. It even has the
same kind of enemies and definitely
takes more elements from Mario, in
its platforming style. A new enemy
however is a killer bunny rabbit that
often pops out of nowhere and chases
you, which I feel is definitely inspired
by Monty Pythons the Holy grail.
The game itself sees you searching
for a Princess by traversing various
worlds each made up of levels. At first
I thought the game was a simple plat-
form game, you can jump on enemies
and climb up ladders and everything
you might expect (except run), but
the first time I died I got a big sur-
prise. You can turn back time! Every
move you make can be reversed, and
not just for a few seconds. It is pos-
sible to rewind time all the way back
to the beginning of the level. This
mechanic is what makes Braid such a
unique game. It makes each level into
a puzzle, rewarding you with jigsaw
pieces which can be made into a pic-
ture for each world. Some elements
are immune to the time reversal
which provides some great puzzles.
How do you get that key at the bot-
tom of a pit? Jump down pick up the
key, and because the key is immune
to time travel, simply time reverse
so you exit the pit holding the key.
Braid becomes progressively harder
and each world adds a new mechanic
which helps keep the game fresh and
entertaining as you go through. One
world for example adds the ability to
set up a sphere which slows the flow
of time, and another has time linked
to your steps meaning that the en-
emies can’t get out of your way and
you need to be creative to get to the
end. One great thing about Braid is
that you can just run through all the
levels, and have done all the worlds in
minutes, but you don’t get anything
out of it. The game rewards getting
those jigsaw pieces and completing
the game properly and truly. It’s an
easy game to just jump in and out of,
collecting more jigsaw pieces each
time but also a game to get competi-
tive at. It is almost made for a speed
run, and even sports a speed run
modeforthemorecompetitiveplayer.
Braid caters to all types of gam-
er whether you just want to run
through the game to say you’ve
played it, complete it 100%, play
it casually from time to time or
be competitive and speed run it.
It’s a charming game, unique and
inventive, and really shows off
what Indie games have to offer.
I woke up to find myself cold and
thirsty on beach in chernarus. All
I had on me was a the clothes I
was wearing and a flashlight. Time
to survive the Zombie apocalypse.
I saw immediately a town sign
which said Камышово which, I
knew from my limited Russian,
was Kamyshovo. However my
knowledge of my location did not
help that much, and therefore in
dire of need of water I decided
to loot the nearby abandoned
houses. As I made my way through
the wreckage a glint on the floor
caught my eye. A compass! Now
I could actually get somewhere.
My tired and thirsty mind vaguely
remembered that due west of my
position there was the big town
Electro, where I new that there
were several supermarkets which
must have some kind of food and
drink.
It was time to venture out onto
the road. I kept a low profile,
avoiding the lone zombie who
stalked the countryside. Soon
I arrived at the outskirts of the
town. Thinking it may be prudent
to check the surrounding houses
before I dived into a potentially
fatal situation, I clambered through
a window to see if I could find
anything. As I scavenged through
the houses I came upon a closed
door. Not thinking anything of it,
I entered,scanning the floor for
loot. As I looked around, my eyes
fell upon a two pairs of shoes. I
looked up in surprise and saw two
helmeted guys looking at me in
surprise, pointing their rusty M4s
at my face. Before I could even
utter an “oh”, they opened fire on
me. As I lay on the floor bleeding to
death, I felt them rustling through
my clothes looking for anything to
steal. Couldn’t even wait for me to
die couldn’t they?
DayZ Stories
The DayZ standalone has been
released, and given the amazing
stories that occur in that game, I
decided to make a kind of series
out it! So here it goes:
