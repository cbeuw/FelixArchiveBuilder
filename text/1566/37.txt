This week, you see a rock on
Queen’s lawn. To prove that
the average Imperial student
has the personality equivalent
to a rock, you nominate him
for BNOC. You convince your
friends to write in letters to ex-
tol his virtues. They praise his
stubborn approach to student
representation. A rockaye wins
by a landslide.
This week, you find a rock ly-
ing on your roommates bed.
You decide that since you
do not have friends anyway,
you may as well adopt him
as a pet rock. You decide
to call him Wilson, and you
become bestest of friends.
However when trying to es-
cape the clutches of Impe-
rial’s solitude, you lose him...
WIIIIILLLSSOONNNNN!!!!
This week, you wake up as
rock. Yes, a smooth, grey,
emotionless rock. You sigh to
your rocky self, well at least
I won’t have that annoying
horniness anymore, right?
However you quickly notice
that due to your permanent
hardness, everything has
just gotten infinitely worse.
Fermented gravel?
This week, tired of being iso-
lated due to your love of Justin
Bieber you decide to steal that
stupid rock which won BNOC.
Once you hold that rock, you
notice that it’s much more awe-
some than you could ever be.
You throw it through the nearest
window and resume your stalk-
ing of J-Biebz.
This week, as you are innocently
doing coursework, a rock hits
you on the head. All of a sud-
den you think its a good idea
to run naked around campus,
screaming “Shine bright like va-
gina” and eating lots of vagina
cream. Your personal tutor sees
you, and immediately gives you
a first on your degree because
you “show initiative”.
This week, feeling like flick-
ing your bean after seeing
someone run around naked,
you decide to use the rock
you found. It is oh, so smooth,
and before you know it, it’s
slipped up inside your snatch.
Strangely it feels harder than
anything you’ve had in there
before, which for Imperial
doesn’t say a lot.
This week, you have to decide
between either always have the
smell of excrement in your nose,
or having One Direction songs in
your head. Both of these options
are too horrible to consider, and
because you can’t decide, both
happen simultaneously. You go
insane and end up crying in your
room. At least you aren’t ‘that
creep’, right?
This week, you finally tell
your medic crush how you
feel. You invite them to dinner
and listen to them telling you
about their day, which includ-
ed a rock inside someones
vag. You seize the moment,
wink creepily and say: “I
have something rock hard for
you!” You’re forever known
as ‘that creep’ on campus.
This week, as a medicine student
you have to deal with someone
coming in with a rock stuck in
their vagina. Looking at the beat
up genitalia, you wonder why you
deserved this torture. As you in-
duce labour, you swear to your-
self that you’re actually going
to follow your twerking dreams.
Then the rock slips into your out-
stretched hands...pint?
This week, so tired of having to
listen to your roommates wail-
ing, you move to the library.
Out of unused books you build
yourself a castle, and proclaim
yourself lord of the top floor.
Soon the cleaners declare war
upon you. You successfully
defend your keep at the battle
of silent space, securing your
rule.
This week, you walk past the
destruction of the library battle.
You think to yourself, at least
you are not as crazy as that
weird knight guy. Then you re-
member that you are actually
a hipster and everyone really
hates you. Oh well, at least you
don’t live in a castle made of
old books right?
This week, after failing yet an-
other coursework. You dream
that you become a rock, be-
come BNOC and end up in
someones vagina. Once you
wake up you decide that Impe-
rial has so completely screwed
your mind, you move out to
California to become a beach
bum and live happily ever after

Frozen water takes centre stage only
once every four years, however athe-
letes must spend years perfecting their
performances on frozen surfaces.
Different Forms
Of Frozen Water
to Play Big Role

DODGY DEAL
INTRIGUING
Norway Attempting To
Anger All The Major
Powers
N
ext week, differing
forms of frozen water
will take a leading role
in a variety of sporting
events across two
weeks.
The competition will feature many of
the world’s nations facing off to see
who can perform the best on a range
of frozen waters. It is also essentially
the only time so much attention is
given to frozen surfaces at any one
time.
The competition runs in stark contrast
to the Summer Olympics which
features much less water and basically
no frozen surfaces at all.
Snowden Nominated For Peace
Prize
W
ith the
n o m i n a t i o n
of Edward
Snowden for
the Nobel Peace
Prize, Norway continued its quest
this week to alienate and anger all the
World’s major powers.
In 2010, they were able to anger China
through it’s awarding of the prize to
Liu Xiaobo. Whilst, in 2009, they were
able to alienate and anger any logical
thinkers by giving the prize to Barack
Obama who had essentially made
very little contribution towards peace.
This year, however, the plucky
Scandinavian country went one
step further and pissed-off the most
powerful nation on Earth directly.
This, however, has left many
commentators wondering
who Norway can anger in the
future, one observer stated:
“With no major powers left, who
is there left worth insulting? I
suppose they could begin hostilities
emerging powers like India or poke
an old-fashioned bear like Russia”
Who will Norway infuriate next?
Could it be you?
