ME: Introduce yourself!
KW: I am a first year Computing
studentfromLondon.Icurrentlyreside
in the Southside Halls of Residence.
ME: What is your position in Felix?
KW: I am the sports editor. I follow
most sports, particularly football,
cricket and tennis, so I felt that when
the opportunity arose, I could see no
reason not to take it on.
ME: How did you get the idea for the
Felix app?
KW: I was trying to read an article
on my phone one time and found it
frustrating. It was inconceivable to
think that a newspaper such as Felix,
which already had a brilliant website
to accompany the printed version, did
not have its own app for students to
browse on the go.
ME: During your coding stage did
you encounter any problems? Did
you have to omit any features (e.g.)?
KW: There weren’t any major
problems. The API wasn’t well suited
to an iPhone app, so I came up with
ways to work around that. The maker
of the API, Jonathan Kim [an imperial
alumni, who also made the website],
is currently working on a new version
that would ensure the next update of
the app works more efficiently.
KW: Users can (predictably) browse
through the latest articles from Felix.
In addition to this, we have a sidebar
that offers many social features. One
can create their own account and post
to discussion boards, “like” articles
and connect with other users. From
early indications, it can be said that
it makes for a much more interactive
user experience.
ME: What are the some of the
current problems with the app?
KW: We are taking a look at ways of
implementing a comments section.
Unfortunately the only true way of
finding problems is by users reporting
them. Fortunately, this hasn’t
happened yet.
ME: In your opinion, why should
people use the app?
KW: For the exact reasons we created
it. It is useful for following Felix on the
go. Our social features also enhance
the Felix experience.
ME: What are your future plans for
the app?
KW: There are many. As I said
previously we are looking at
implementing a comments section.
Another item on the list is the
addition of an issue archive, allowing
students to browse past editions. But,
as is the case for most apps, we will
try to implement what the user wants
us to implement. There is a feedback
section in the app’s sidebar that can be
used for this, or you could send us an
email at felix@imperial.ac.uk
At this point the app is only available
for iOS sadly, however there are
plans for an android app. If you do
own an iOS device and want to try
out Kunal’s great work, either scan
the QR code on the left or just head
over to the App Store and search
“Felix Imperial”. Just keep in mind
that the account you make there is
seperate from your official imperial
acount.
Felix on the move!

You must have seen it around these
days, the proliferation of pink flyers
littering imperial’s walkways. Flyers
that seem to have the word yolo
written on them. However fear not
my dear students, our university
has not descended into a swag-
palace. No these flyers actually say
yoyo on them, and what they talk
about is actually quite intriguing.
Its been actually quite hard to
evade the information that has
been bombarding imperial students
concerning Yoyo. Emails from sabs,
posters and/or flyers have been
almost ever present since the launch.
However for those of you who do not
know what yoyo is here is a quick
overview. It is a company funded by
Imperial that is meant to counter the
yearly calls for allowing payments
with our college ID cards. Capitalising
on the prevalence of smartphones and
the rise of mobile payments, we now
haveanappforiOSandAndroidwhich
allows you to pay at all taste imperial
outlets (which excludes the union).
You connect your bank account to the
app, then load it up and are good to
go. At the actual till all you do is pull
out the app, let the cashiers scan the
QR code that your phone shows you.
Now as a lazy imperial student (I
know why I am one), you are probably
wondering why should I go through
the hassle of downloading an app
(gasp, such an effort!) and linking my
bank account to it? Well imagine this
scenario: You have just gotten out of a
horrible double lecture, haven’t eaten
for an age and generally feel like you
take a large bite out of anything that
stumbles across your path. As you
make your way to your food stop of
choice you suddenly remember that,
damn, you have no cash. Sighing, you
make your way to the cash machine.
As you arrive a look of horror spreads
across your face as a line starting at
the ATMs going all the back to south
kensington station fills your view. You
ain’t going to get your lunch easy. This
is where Yoyo steps in. You can cut
out the entire cueing by just topping
up your account on your phone,
entirely on the go. Furthermore the
fact that you do not need to fumble
for cash at the register means that
once you have scanned your phone
you are good to go. Imagine if
everyone had this? It would make
getting food so much more quick and
efficient, and that’s what we imperial
students like right? So essentially the
reasons that you should go for Yoyo
is because of the hassle yo safe if you
are cashless and looking to get it at
peak hours, as well as the speed you
can check out without any change
falling potentially falling to the floor.
On the other hand what are the
cons of getting Yoyo? There are
actually quite a few, related to
security. Pretty much, if you lose
your phone and you have no security
measures they at leisure to spend as
much as they want on your account.
Furthermore if you are pretty open
with your account details you should
also be worried, as anyone can set
up a Yoyo account with your details
without any further verification.
In my own experience of using the
app, I have generally not encountered
any problems. The quickness and ease
of paying with my phone is something
that I have thoroughly enjoyed.
Furthermore if you are planning to
use Yoyo, then start today! Today
is the last day that when you top up
you get a 10% bonus! My last piece
of advice, even though this thing
is pretty useful, carry some cash,
because everyone knows: Cash is king
Paying in style: #yoyonotyolo
ME: What are the main features of
the app?
