Coffee Break
H
okay, I am back. Last
week we had some
apologies, so this week I
have decided to update
you on my life adven-
ture. We all good? Kay lets begin...
Last time I was telling you all about
how I secured some moolah (long sto-
rey short, I cut my hair and got paid
a lump sum). Well what did I do with
this newly acquired cash? Spend it of
course. Not as if I’d invest it or some-
thing sensible like that. However when
the time came to throw the paper into
the fire that is shopping, I was troubled
as where to start. I was all so tempted to
whip out my laptop and internet shop
until the early hours of the morning,
however in a more random encoun-
ter, I ended up at the new Westfields
Shopping Centre in Shepherds Bush.
From the number 49 bus you can see
this mammoth adventure land from
at least a mile away. From this point it
looked absolutely huge, but as the bus
traversed along its route, the building
became ever larger, with new annex’s
of the shopping plaza coming into
sight the closer in proximity you be-
came. As I got off the bus at Shepherds
Bush station, my whole field of vision
was encompassed by the shiny exterior
housing an unknown number of shops
within its belly.
As you walk along the “valley” that
leads to the entrance you are sur-
rounded by restaurants diverse in va-
riety. Those that stay focused are then
led into the womb of Westfields, with
the first section dubbed “The Village”
which to me seems ironic as it’s luxu-
rious interior complete with chande-
liers is inhabited by the most high end
shops at hand. Not “Village” like to me.
Now I originally thought this place
looked big on the outside, but after you
penetrate the shell you seem to be in a
space far larger than you can imagine.
With a huge spanning atrium, several
floors, spacious and modern design,
this centre exudes quality in every di-
rection. Its modern large touch screen
panels supply you with all the informa-
tion you can handle.
Well after being lost for several hours
I finally managed to end up at my start-
ing point. Useful? No. However on
a second run through I hit the shops
harder than Chuck Norris can hit the
Titanic. Which he did, I saw it in a
movie. I think it was also called Titanic.
Chuck Norris played some kind of Ice
Berg. Anyway the more time I seemed
to spend in his place, the more money
that was drained from the debit card.
Thought I may add that my wonderful
girlfriend picked out all my clothes, so
thank you honey. Hokay. Bai.

You wanted an
anecdote as well, right?
Well, at some point
over the Christmas
holiday, one of my
friends from uni came
to visit me in Singapore (you might know him.
He’s little and Portuguese). One afternoon, we
found ourselves watching a movie. It wasn’t any
movie, however. It was Coyote Ugly. Oh, and it
gets better. Not only were we watching Coyote
Ugly, we were watching it, not in a cinema or
someone’s living room, but in a salon, getting
pedicures.
Libra
I just can’t take it any-
more- these exams are
getting to me so badly,
I am tearing my own
hair. My stress levels
is so high, everytime
someone does something that I don’t like I lash
out. Someone sat near me the other day, and
almost invaded my personal space. So I stabbed
him to death with the blade from a pencil sharp-
ener. Will I get away with manslaughter?
Taurus
It’s the big week for
you, you finally pop
the big question to
the girl you’re dating
in halls. You cook her
breakfast and as she’s
scoffing down the burnt toast with Marmite
(that’s just wrong!), you get down on one knee,
look her in the eyes and smile. “Darling, you
know I love you so much. With that in mind,
will you let me fuck you in the ass?”
Horoscopes: a gateway to the mind of a lunatic
So it turns out that you do like these Horoscopes very much, we knew that, we were only kidding you...

Virgo
You pikie shit in the
SAF. If you keep on
stealing stuff from
peoples bags you
will have the spleen
beaten out of you by
a big Rugby player. Or the whole team. Once
people find out what you are up to, I am pretty
sure that many other teams will join in. We
won’t kill you- no that’ll be far too nice. We’ll
keep you alive but just crippled. We will.
Capricorn
You sit there watching
cartoons all day.
After almost a week
you begin find Bugs
Bunny attractive. To
confirm whether you
are in fact mental you decide to knock one out
whilst munching on a carrot. As you furiously
masturbate your mother enters the room to find
you with the carrot rammed up your arse and
sperm all over the screen. You need help. Pint?
Sagittarius
“Oh Mary my sexy
piece of sexy sex.”
Answer the phone
like that again in my
presence and I will,
without fail, kill you
by ramming your phone down your throat. I am
disgusted by you.
Cancer
This week you
decide you really
don’t like Lady Gaga.
That stuck up, fringe
faced yank mother
fucker of a diva
thinks she’ll impress the British by saying “I
drink tea too!”. As revenge, you tie her up, shave
that gelled mop off her head and boil her in
some Earl Grey until her cologen lips explode.
How do you like our tea now bitch?
Gemini
See, now if only our
Coffee Break Editor
had decided to ask
what was in Taurus
instead of actually
getting engaged to
his girl, we would not be mocking him. On be-
half of all the men in the office: RAVI, YOU’VE
CHANGED... YOU USED TO BE COOL BUT
NO MORE (ed: sorry about the in joke guys, but
if you can, check it out on facebook. Lad down!)
Leo
This week the
cleaners in Beit
decide that the latrine
needs a good wipe
down. On lifting the
lid they are literally
taken aback at the site that greets them. They
decided that the only way to fix this is to use
literally, a whole fucking can of bleach. The smell
wafts into your room where the acid dissolves
your throat. You cough up blood for a week.
Aries
I love you so much.
I want to kiss you all
over and over again.
Eva, you beautiful
Eastern European bar
maid, you can pull
my pint anytime you want.
Pisces
Last week you posted
a comment on some-
body’s profile picture.
Even though the
homosexual connota-
tions of the photo
were pretty fucking clear and even though
anybody who saw it got the joke, you insisted
on stating the bleeding obvious. You are literally
the worst person in existence. I hate you, all of
the felix staff hate you and I’m pretty sure most
people at College hate you. Please, please be
less annoying... give it a try, you might find that
your life improves, and it might dissuade me
from lodging an axe into your face.
Aquarius
This week you
decide to have a
bit of tumble down
some stairs for shits
and giggles and hurt
your leg. Good, you
deserve it! You get the ambulance to take you to
the doctor where you both decided that the leg
is broken. After a few weeks in a cast, you both
realise that you read the x-ray wrong and now
you have a diminished leg. MEDIC FAIL!
