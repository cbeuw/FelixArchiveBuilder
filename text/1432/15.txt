any of you
may worry
about
some
of
the styles we showcase
here will not be able
to withstand the test
of the wind. Upon a
breeze you will be re-
vealing too much of
yourself. An easy
solution would of
course be wear-
ing the cap
as seen in
step 3
and
4.

Fashion Editor – Dan Wan & Kawai Wong
Four easy and fabulous headscarves
Headscarves, or in the Muslim sense, hijabs represent modesty. felix shows you that modest is not
necessarily bland. Kawai Wong teams up with Anum Farooq and Mehwaesh Islam to give you four styles in
small little steps.
60s Dresses
Summer is just about in! A
time for both boys and girls
to go out any buy summer
clothes. Boys, stay away. Girls,
go for 60s dresses. Stay away
from the usual floral Topshop
dresses this year, for once.
I Heart NY
We’ve seen it all before, but
its essentially iconic. Oh, how
do you solve a problem like an
overworn T-shirt? Just make
sure it doesn’t look like you’ve
bought it from Urban Outfit-
ters in Staines. Actually, make
sure you’ve bought it from
a grotty Asian man on 5th
Avenue.
White people with dreadlocks
White people with dreadlocks
look like they live in a gutter
and are too “progressive” for
vanities like soap and a comb.
Imagine running your hands
through someone’s silky hair...
then imagine if that hair is the
clogged up gross hair that
comes out of the shower drain
hole. Dreads are shit. (Sorry
Stef.)

S
o what really do the Mus-
lim girls think? For Anum,
“Wearing the headscarf is
linked to notions of modesty
and self-discipline, alongside
the perception that one is not judged
on appearance but rather on character.
Although my headscarf does not make
me who I am (because that would be
just weird), it is a visual representation
of my beliefs.”
Modesty aside, many view the head-
scarf as an art form. Indeed, this piece
of clothing has long and rich history. In
earlier times, the headscarf was worn
by both Christian, Muslim and Jew-

Y
oo hoo, the underpants
issue! Oh well, everyone
is stressed during exams.
And we know how much
you love felix fashion and
it will be unfair for us to churn out an-
other heftily wordy issue. More reading
just does not do anybody any good.
So next week in fashion we are go-
ing to sample some of the high street’s
finest underpants and rate them ac-
cording to comfort, design, style and
support. When compared to the costly
Emporio Armani’s and Calvin Klein’s
ones - are Primark’s or H&M’s un-
derpants unwearable after all? And,
no, fashion is not all about the exte-
rior. Any expertise advise on the pants
front? Tell felix fashion at
felix.fashion@imperial.ac.uk!

Instructions
1. Bored of this?
2. Hide your hair in this comfy cap.
3. Put it on. Da di da.
4. Looks good just as it is.
5. Basic step: drape fabric over cap.
6. Summer Genie: collect the drapes
on the sides and tie around the back.
7. Da di da.
8. Pull the remaining fabric on either
side to the front.
9.Tuck above ears and underneath the
wrap.
10. Looking good!
11. Pink Hippie: basic step again.
12-14: Roll up a long piece of fabric
and wrap around your forehead. Tie
around the back or on the side in a flo-
ral knot.
15. Voila!
16. Your fabric should be this biiiiiig.
Hence the bedsheet effect!
17. Basic step first. Then take one side
of the drape and bring it round the side
of your head.
18-19. Loop the very same drape on
the top of your head.
20-21. Experiment with the looping
and draping until it fits and you look
fab.
22. Optional step to create a more dra-
matic effect: sit a lighter fabric on top
of the basal wrap. The pattern should
stay on the side of the head so that it
isn’t too overwhelming.
23. There you go, look in the mirror
and drool over yourself.
24. Before you start, tie your hair up to
create a stem so that your scarf’s bun
would have a lever to rest on. Repeat
12-14.
25. Tie the beige accessory scarf tightly
- and I mean tightly - below your bun.
26-27. Wrap one turn of the aqua fab-
ric around the stem. Then a turn of the
beige. Alternate these steps until you
use up both fabrics.
28. Insert the end of the fabric towards
the base of the bun to fasten.
29. You should wear this to uni every
day.

Fashion
ish women with their own respective
styles and traditions. The styles also
range from Spanish, Turkish to Indo-
African! Fashion-wise, the diversity of
fabrics used, means that it is difficult
for fashion to not notice the next big
thing.
Have you noticed the new H&M
Matthew Williamson campaign? Yes,
the model was wrapped in a chiffon
floral print dress, complete with a
headscarf. So whether or not you are
Muslim, these two pages are still good
inspiration for you to create your own
fantastic summer look. Without fur-
ther ado...
Weird FAQs
Q: Did your parents force you to wear the headscarf?
A: It is not a helmet, no pushing is involved. And most girls choose to wear
it by choice anyway. Read the article above!
Q: Do you wear this in the shower?
A: It might just be the fun solution to laundry... But no. In fact you don’t
really wear this around your family... If in doubt, Wikipedia is always the
answer.
Q: Are you bald?
A: If I see you in a hat... ever...
Q: Do you have to buy your scarves from special shops?
A: Well you can. Any high street scarves would do. And in fact, any fabrics
to you can get hold of...
If you fancy trendy, you should check this one out:
http://www.imaancollections.com/
Here is a UK based online retailer:
http://www.thehijabshop.com
This one here sells upmarket hijab:
http://www.saouli.eu/index-en.html.
And in fact, Sherperds Bush Market is probably the best place in London
to get them.
A final note: you fashionistas must follow hel-looks.com or the Satorialist
fervently. And here is a fashion blog for Muslim women:

They are available
across the UK in
various markets
and vendors. But
this specific one
was bought at
Sheperds Bush
Market. Another
solution will be
what Anum is
doing here: wrap
the stray ends of
the scarf around
yourself and fas-
ten with a pin.
Drape the
red acces-
sory scarf
around
your
neck to
further
secure.
Quick
fix!
