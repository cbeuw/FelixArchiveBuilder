Imperial’s Secret Garden
In a new series on the lesser known parts of Imperial,
Kadhim Shubber presents the perfect place for a picnic
Who knows when the Queen’s Lawn
Marquee may pop up again, leaving
Imperial students with no grassy area
of significant size to waste away those
sunny days on. But never fear! there is
hope for all you flora loving scientists!
The Prince’s Gate Gardens are one
of Imperial’s best kept secrets (until
now). This large area of grassy good-
ness has up until now been known only
to Union hacks and members of Envi-
ronmental Society (who own the even
secreter secret garden inside Prince’s
Gate Gardens), despite being displayed
prominently on every map of Impe-
rial’s campus.
While not as convenient as the
Queen’s Lawn or Prince’s Gardens, the
garden has several advantages. It isn’t
surrounded by the oppressive archiec-
ture of College (like the Queen’s Lawn)
or the unsightly vision of construc-
tion workers baring their ass cracks
(like the Prince’s Gardens, which are
dominated by construction on the new
Eastside Halls).
In addition it is, and always will be,
100% Marquee-free. It’s open daily
from 8am until 6pm (it’s all locked up
the rest of the time unless you have the
code, which even we don’t have).
With trees, bushes, actual peace and
quiet and even a few squirrels, this is
the perfect place to get away from re-
vision and maybe have a picnic with
friends when The Queen’s Lawn is in-
accessible and Hyde Park seems like a
bit of a mission away.
However, you are allowed
to bring frisbees, cats and
boomboxs. Best party ever...

On the 18th of May voting opens for
the medical school’s main elections,
with results being announced on the
following Friday. That last statement
may surprise some readers but don’t
worry, medic guerrilla hit squads
haven’t stormed the newspaper office
and staged a coup. This really is an
ICSMstoryinfelix.Andwhileofcourse
this election bares more relevance to
medical students, the results are likely
to have repercussions throughout the
university. Sixteen positions are up for
grabs with the most interesting being
president, and who to replace the in-
cumbent Mark Chamberlain?
As in the recent ICU elections, fol-
lowing a shock last minute withdrawal,
only one candidate is in the race for the
top job. That man is Anil Chopra, so
on a sunny (but cold!) Monday after-
noon I decided to meet this third year
medic and try and understand what his
presidential campaign was all about.
Anil arrived in the Beit Quad, and af-
ter some light chitchat we got straight
down to the meat and bones of the in-
terview. What motivation did this man
have to want a year out from his medi-
cal studies to take on this sabbatical
role? For the CV-whores there are, af-
ter all, several positions of responsibil-
ity which don’t require such a large ex-
penditure of time and effort. A need to
give back to the medical school which
has apparently given him so much, as
well as the honour of leading one of the
country’s top medical institutions was
his answer. Conversation got slightly
more interesting with the mention of
former ICSMSU president, and Anils’
cousin Shiv Chopra. While declaring
that this had nothing to do with his
own decision to run Anil also added
that Shiv was an inspiration to all stu-
dents, including himself. Certainly
there can be no arguing with that, his
achievements formally recognised
with an Outstanding Service Award
from the Union. When the inevita-
ble comparison came up Anil seemed
most uncomfortable, “I hate the idea
of comparing the two Chopras” and
finished off saying that he would do a
“different” job.
So what are the issues within the
medical school that warrant attention?
The first thing Anil mentioned was
education, whether this was a subcon-
scious sign of his priorities or merely
co-incidental I’m not sure. Currently
the medical school curriculum is go-
ing through a wholesale facelift, result-
ing in more than just a few nips and
tucks. With the current culture in the
NHS being one of change for changes
sake, Anil sought to as-
sure me that he would
get all relevant opinions
before anything was rub-
ber stamped and that he
would make sure that any
changes made would be
for the good of the medi-
cal school. Another point
Anil brought up was the
current expansion of de-
grees offered by ICSM.
In addition to quite obvi-
ously offering medicine,
the medical school also
offers biomedical science
and starting next year
pharmacology as part of
its undergraduate degrees. While this
expansion is to be lauded, it remains to
be seen whether these students can be
fully integrated within the school and
its ethos, without feeling victimised or
shunned for not being “real” medics as
is arguably the case now.
Recent surveys about student sat-
isfaction in the medical school have
often been quite positive (especially in
comparison to the main college) but
one issue which often crops up is the
dominance of alcohol within ICSM
socials. Maybe it’s to do with the high
stress levels but rightly or wrongly
one of the enduring traits of being a
medical student has always been the
heavy drinking culture. Anil quoted
the cliché that you don’t have to drink
to have fun, while at the same time
emphasising that there was no ques-
tion of changing any of the big ticket
events such as the Roadshow which
are by nature booze fueled affairs. Of
course, events like these are the high-
light of many a freshers experience, but
it is important not to ignore and alien-
ate the significant minority who don’t
drink for whatever reasons.
Considering the hateful scorn with
which most non-medics are seen by
medical students, I wondered what
potentially the next president thought
of IC. Half expecting a string of exple-
tives, I was surprised to hear the man
talk of there being a friendly rivalry
which exists “only on the pitch”, and
how there wasn’t really a separation
between medics and non-medics at
Imperial. However when probed fur-
ther, Anil admitted to the divide but in-
stead of talking about ways of increas-
ing unity, argued that this division was
necessary and how the medical school
ethos couldn’t be incorporated into the
main university. Perhaps this is true,
but without trying how do we know?
We talked a little about the issue of
welfare,somethingwhichcropsupwith
an uneasy regularity in Union politics.
A recent ICSMSU student survey high-
lighted this area as one requiring over-
haul, but despite this Anil confidently
claimed “there is a pretty good welfare
system”. The current year
1 and 2 academic officer,
did, however, express his
disappointment at the
personal tutor system.
The problem in essence
is that people only go to
their tutors when some-
thing really goes wrong.
Anil told me the system
doesn’t have to work like
that. But with many of
the people employed as
tutors being busy aca-
demics or clinicians with
little time for students, it
remains to be seen how it
can be any different. The
problem of personal tutors not only
affects the medical school, and has
often been brought up at main ICU
meetings.
Anil seemed keen on bringing up the
Reynolds Bar (the Union bar at Char-
ing Cross Hospital), and how he felt it
wasn’t being used to its fullest extent.
This may be true as the Reynolds bar is
often empty several nights a week, but
he didn’t really offer any concrete plans
to use this potential.
Throughout the interview, one thing
which was evident was the lack of any
new or interesting ideas to truly excite
me about this election campaign. No
plans to introduce complimentary Thai
masseurs in lecture theatres, nothing
about a Playboy-esque hot tub in the
Reynolds, nothing that is really going
to get people talking. What there was
though was an infectious enthusiasm
for the medical school and a real desire
to engage with the students. At several
points during the questioning the inter-
view was turned on its head, and Anil
asked me what my thoughts were. It
didn’t feel like he was using this as a get-
out clause, it felt like he genuinely cared
and wanted my take on the issue. In
several answers he stressed the need to
reach out to all students and to be acces-
sible to anyone who wants to meet the
president. Both admirable endeavours
and ones that fit in with his approach-
able demeanour. At times the discus-
sion did get heated, but Anil always
remained calm and measured. The only
exception to this was when asked for a
photo; he almost broke down as he had
not “done his hair”! From this short in-
terview it was quite evident how much
energy and passion had been put into
this campaign, if I was RON I would
certainly be very worried indeed.
