Preview Download Festival
2009
With Download Festival approaching fast, felix has decided to preview it for your
pleasure. In my opinion the best thing about this festival is the sole fact that my
exams finish on the 11th
. Now exams are the worst thing all year, so what is better
than a music festival to pick you up straight after?
Now I know Download Festival is a heavy metal festival, but believe it or not,
I like the music, and so do many other people. With a massive line up this year
(unlike last years poor attempt) fans form all over the country , and I’m sure the
world, will assemble en mass to smoke, drink and get fucking messy!
The first thing I want to talk about is how much I’m looking forward to seeing
some of the bands on show. In what may be a surprise, the band I’m most excited
about are “The Prodigy”. Now I know they don’t really fit into the whole Metal
genre, but the gigs these guys put on are fucking brutal. Taking a 10Kg mace to
the next year’s editor’s, Dan Wan’s, face would be a beautiful cherry blossom in
comparison. Also there are solid favourites such as the ureal Slipknot. Who else
will be a “must see” during my time there? Well there will be Clutch (Think of
cowboy metal), the sick and twisted Marilyn Manson, the hard hitting Opeth and
the classic one hit wonder, Journey. I also want to make an effort to see the other
great bands (and there are so many). In particular Faith No More, Korn, Staind,
Dragonforce and Dream Theatre.
The next thing on my agenda is the whole camping element associated with
music festivals. Now I’m going to have to trawl the inter webs to find a nice, but
extremely cheap tent, to live in for three days, until the end of the festival comes,
causing everyone to become crazed animals. The burning of tents is an almost
sacred ritual which seems to happen every time. I feel there is no escape, so the
cheaper the tent the better. Also I will need to stock up on some serious booze. I
think 10 cases of beer for three days is a minimum. Not just beer though, a com-
plete stocking of all things recreation need to be done, It’s just beer is the most
important.
The last thing that I have to think about is travel. Seriously, this place is in don-
nington, and I don’t have a car available to drive this year. Lets hope the shuttle
busses form the train station are still running by time we get there. All in all Down-
load is something I am very happy about attending. YAY!
I am extremely excited about my first time at Download festival. With hundreds of
bands playing and SO MUCH beer to drink it will be impossible to see it all! Friday
starts off with a massive throwback to the early 90’s with not one but TWO of nu-
metal’s biggest bands: KoRn and the newly-reformed Limp Bizkit! Sure, neither
band has pulled out a good album for 10 years, but the 14-year old inside of me
cannot freakin wait to headbang to such kickass tracks as “Blind” or “Rollin”!
On a more serious note, metalcore gods Killswitch Engage will be previewing
songs from their forthcoming album which is bound to trigger a fair amount of
ultra-violent. Mmm. UK screamo crew Bring Me The Horizon are known for their
in-your-face sets, and at least one person should lose an eye during their per-
formance, so I’ll definitely be there to see it. The “Heaviest Mo Fos” award will
definitely go to experimental madmen Meshuggah, who are guaranteed to make
your ears bleed with complex rhythms and never-ending layers of distortion.
A little out of place among all the metal bands, punk band Billy Talent will have a
hard time winning over any fans. But to be honest I’m especially looking forward
to seeing these guys live, kicking and screaming through tunes like “Devil In A
Midnight Mass” or their breakthrough “Try Honesty”.
It is no secret though that the highlight of the day – if not of the festival – will be
seeing the original line-up of Faith No More, featuring my personal Jesus - Mike
Patton. Screaming along with him and thousands of others to “Epic” or “Midlife
Crisis” will be a goddamn dream come true.
Day 2 sees the return of more nu-metal stars (seems to be the theme this year),
like Slipknot – who have actually gotten better since the “death” of nu-metal – and
the God Of Fuck himself, Marilyn Manson. Without a doubt, they will tear the
festival apart. Electronic rockers Pendulum will probably fail to convince the met-
alheads, whereas old-school legends The Prodigy will be just plain awesome.
I can see it all ready: Ravi and I screaming out the lyrics to “Thunder”, downing
beers, whilst setting ourselves on fire. Okay maybe that isn’t exactly how it will go
down, but it will be something along those lines.
Day 3 seems a little bit weaker in comparison, but we’ll probably be passed
out in the tent most of the day anyway. With a bit of luck we’ll get to see prog-
metal veterans Dream Theater and groove-metal tyrants Clutch. Not very prob-
able though…
