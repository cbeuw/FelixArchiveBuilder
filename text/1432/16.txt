Do e-Fags make you a big e-diot?
Afonso Campos reviews the CigStar Electronic Cigarettes and is not totally underwhelmed
Hesh Alex Hugh Kadhim Dan
“Yeah it’s alright.
Surprisingly
satisfying.“
“I think it’s pretty
good; not sure if
someone trying to
quit would find it
that useful.”
“It tastes like
chemicals which
somehow have
become rotten.“
“Tastes horrible.
I don’t really see
why they exist. It is
cool to blow smoke
rings in the library
though.”
“What the hell is
this? I feel like I’m
not killing myself
when I smoke this.
A good or bad
thing?”
I have never been so confused! I want the real cigarette, but I want it indoors. Could CigStar be the answer to all my problems?
E
quipped with an almost in-
timidating desire to save
the part of the world which,
like myself finds the con-
cept of slow-motion sui-
cide through sucking on an ill-tasting
stick a good idea, Hon Lik invented the
Electronic Cigarette. A heavy smoker,
Hon used to smoke no less than two
packs a day until the death of his fa-
ther due to lung cancer. This came to
be the crucial moment which Lik drew
inspiration from for his potentially life-
changing device.
Is his idea of the E-Cigarette one that
society could embrace and accept en-
masse? Or is it just a massive flake that
will instead have the world laughing at
the owners of these devices with an air
of unrestrained disdain?
At felix, we were sent a starter pack of
CigStar, one of the few UK distributors
of the e-Cigarette. The device looks
very much like a cigarette, despite the
obvious added weight and extra length.
It is, undoubtedly, something that
based on aesthetics alone should not
be immediately discarded. The device
contains no tobacco whatsoever and
works by replacing cartridges of nico-
tine and recharging a battery. Inside
the cigarette is a heating element that
vapourises the nicotine for intake and
at the same time, creates a much-ap-
preciated cloud of smoke for the sake
of realism.
I was pleasantly surprised. Although
my expectations were somewhat low,
they were wildly surpassed. The reason
I like these cigarettes is threefold: I can
most definitely feel the nicotine kick
when I take a few drags; the smoke,
although not epic in proportions, is
there and is a definite attractive factor,
despite being just water vapour; and
finally, the thought of smoking in the
library or in a coffee shop is one that,
as a heavy smoker, makes me insanely
happy. The taste on the other hand, is
something that as of today, leaves much

old shisha pipe filled with unflavoured
tobacco without lighting it. This is al-
most enough to turn me off the device
completely, were it not for my addic-
tion (to novelty gadgets, not nicotine).
There is much
work to do on
this front.
Around the
College, we
were allowed
to smoke in
the library and
in daVinci’s
without any
problem. In
fact, the ciga-
rette aroused
much curios-
ity in staff who
were all willing
to try it out.
We have gone
around cam-
pus and asked Imperial smokers to
try the CigStar Electronic Cigarettes
and give us their opinions. Consensus
is mixed, but I have faith in this little
product of vice.

C
ome to our office during
the weekday and chances
are you’ll hear some loud
music blasting out of one
of the iMacs. No, we don’t
have a dedicated music library (as far
as I know) nor do we have the effort to
plug speakers into someone’s iPod; we
just use Spotify.
If you haven’t already heard of Spot-
ify, here’s a quick description: it is an
online jukebox, allowing you to legally
play music without downloading or
even buffering. In fact, Spotify’s slogan
sums it all up nicely: “A world of mu-
sic. Instant, simple and free.” To access
the library, it’s just a matter of signing
up, downloading the simple client soft-
ware (Windows and Mac supported;
Linux users can run Spotify in Wine)
and then start searching.
While the service is still in beta and
by invitation only, Spotify already has
a huge library of just over three mil-
lion tracks available to UK users (not
all tracks are available in some coun-
tries due to licensing issues). However,
this still excludes many of my favourite
albums such as Robbie Williams’ “Sing
When You’re Winning” (although
most of his other albums are available),
Utada’s latest album and most of Ali-
son Krauss’ albums. You should be fine
with the latest tracks though.
Like most other music players you
can build your own playlists or queue
songs in Spotify. What I would love to
see is a playlist import wizard so that
you won’t have to start from nothing. I
would guess most people won’t bother
with this anyway: if you don’t mind
listening to just one artist for a while,
Spotify does have a useful “Popularity”
sorting option - something that iTunes
and Windows Media Player lack - to
let you listen to the best tracks straight
away. Alternatively, you can click on
the artist’s name to see a list of similar
artists or a list of albums that the artist
appears on.
One feature that Spotify urgently
needs to add is something similar to
iTunes’ Genius, which gives you a list
of tracks that are similar to a chosen
track or the one you are listening to.
The only thing closest to this is Spot-
ify’s “Radio” which lets you pick a pe-
riod and genres, and it will output a
landscape list of album covers contain-
ing the matching tracks.
For some bizarre reason you can’t
scroll along the list, so you would have
to keep skipping tracks until you find
one that you like.
The only real black spot is Spotify’s
advertisements. The occasional ad-
vert banner in the interface is fine, but
it’s the intrusive and repetitive audio
clips that become rather annoying
after a while. You would also soon be
able to memorise the words spoken
by Spotify’s “charity muggers”, as The
Independent’s Tim Walker calls them,
asking you to consider their ad-free
premium service. I don’t mind them
though as long as it’s “Roberta from
Spotify”. She’s hot.
Verdict: great stuff, almost there.
Spotify - the future of music radio?
It’s free and it’s legal, but surely this is a dream too good to be true? Not that good, says Richard Lai.

Watch out, iTunes and Windows Media Player! Spotify will probably gobble you up with its free music! (Songbird is elsewhere on the map)
