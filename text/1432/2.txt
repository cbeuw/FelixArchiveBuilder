Six fire engines arrived at the Royal
School of Mines last Friday evening to
deal with a reportedly “small” fire. An
outbreak was said to have started in
laboratories residing within the base-
ment floor.
Fire alarms meant the entire build-
ing was evacuated immediately, prior
to the call to the London Fire Brigade
(LFB). Despite the limited size of the
fire, a total of six fire engines arrived
at the Prince Consort Road entrance.
The site of multiple fire engines caused
some concern amongst passing stu-
dents and staff, but the chemical-based
nature of work within the building
meant standard cautionary measures
require several LFB units to on scene.
A similar site on campus was seen
in March 2007 when a chemistry lab
on the third floor of the RCS building
set alight but was reduced within ten
minutes.
A larger fire occurred two months
earlier as the London Fire Brigade
worked throughout the night to put
out an extensive fire on the Albert Hall
RSM ablaze. Ish. Sort of. Eh
Mansions, a residential block over-
looking Beit Quad. Much alike these
incidents, the fire in the RSM caused
no casualties.
Immediate disruption was felt by lo-
cal residents on Friday night; the ob-
struction of the six fire engines and
then the subsequent partial cordoning
off of Prince Consort Road.
A week on, and little to no further
disruption to College life has occurred,
apart from the general consensus of
worry that Materials students are
becoming ever-increasing liabilities
around College.

Pope Benedict XVI has been on his first
pilgrimage to the Middle-East this past
week as leader of the Catholic Church.
His itinerary encompassed Jordan, Is-
rael, and the Palestinian territory, hold-
ing meetings with leaders from all three,
and he celebrated a Mass in Bethlehem,
Josaphat Valley, and Nazareth. One of the
main aims of the pontiff on his visit is to
preserve a diminishing Christian presence in the Holy Land, as he urged for
reconciliation between the three Abrahamic faiths (Christianity, Islam and
Judaism). During a meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, the
pope offered his support for Palestinians’ right to a homeland.
Benedict’s presence in Israel has provoked some rows to flare however, in-
cluding over his membership to the Hitler Youth in Germany (to which he
said he was forcefully subscribed) in the 1940s, and the Vatican’s imminent
beatification of Pope Pius XII, who failed to speak out against the Holocaust
during his reign which spanned WWII.

India’s month-long general election has almost come to an end.
With a population of 1.1 billion people of whom 714 million are eligible
voters, making it the most populous democracy in the world, the task or
organising India’s elections has been gargantuan. To cope, voting days have
been staggered over the course of a month to allow election officials and se-
curity personnel to move across the country.
This week voters in the last few remaining states cast their ballot, allowing
the counting process to begin this Saturday 16 May, and the numerical results
to be announced early on Sunday.
The numbers will determine the proportion of the 543 seats in the Lok
Sabha (lower house of parliament) awarded to the ruling UPA or opposition
NDA coalitions, and to smaller left-wing and regional political parties.

This Tuesday, Japan and Russia have
struck a nuclear energy deal, and
vowed to end a long-standing territo-
rial dispute through any diplomatic
means necessary.
When Russia’s Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin met his Japanese counterpart Taro
Aso in Tokyo, both reiterated the impor-
tance of strengthening economic ties be-
tween their nations. The energy deals include an oil exploration agreement,
and the exchange of Japanese nuclear technology for a secure supply of Rus-
sian uranium.
Japan and Russia still lack a post-war peace treaty, since they have never
settled the dispute over a group of four islands, which Japan calls the North-
ern Territories, and Russia calls the Southern Kurils. These strategic islets in
the Pacific Ocean have been administered by Moscow ever since they were
captured by Soviet forces at the end of WWII.

Imperial doctorate student Tom
Whyntie is single-handedly improv-
ing Imperial’s reputation as a teaching
university with his progression into the
finals of Nesta FameLab.
First held in 2005, FameLab is a na-
tional competition which attempts to
find the best science presenter in the
country. Contestants are limited to a
three minute presentation of topics of
interest, with finalists getting a chance
to talk at the Cheltenham Science Fes-
tival in the summer.
The Cambridge physics graduate,
currently based at CERN in Geneva,
won first place in the Oxford regional
heat and secured himself a place in the
national finals to be held on June 5th.
Whyntie is no stranger to giving com-
plex issues a user-friendly feel, having
given humorous, informal lectures on
his research work all over the country.
His guest talk to the Imperial Physics
Society last December drew a large
crowd who welcomed a discussion
combining a topical stand-up routine
with the intricacies of high-energy
physics research.
All of us at felix wish him the best of
luck in June.

You would have thought that the Sab-
batical elections would be the last elec-
tion for some time. You were wrong.
The summer term sees several posi-
tions being up for contention, mainly
within the Graduate School Associta-
tion (GSA), the Medical Students’ Un-
ion as well as a few positions on the Im-
perial College Union (ICU) Council.
Within the GSA, positions include
Chair, treasurer, secretary, activities
co-ordinator, Postscript Editor, Engi-
neering Postgraduate Representative,
Physical Sciences Postgraduate Repre-
sentative, Business School Postgradu-
ate Representative, Life Sciences Post-
graduate Representative and Medical
School Postgraduate Representative.
For the ICU Council, the positions
available are Council Chair, Commu-
nity Action Group Chair, RAG Chair,
Welfare Campaigns Officer, Equal Op-
portunities Officer and International
Students’ Officer. It is rumoured that
Afonso Campos, current Chair and
Presidential candidate until he with-
drew, is standing for the position again
this year, however, he might have some
stiff opposition from current Medical
President, Mark Chamberlain, who is
also rumoured to be standing for the
position. Nominations for these posi-
tions close on the 20th May and voting
opens on the 29 May until the 2 June.
The ICSMSU elections are already
in full swing, with one set of hustings
having already taken place. The full list
of candidates can be seen to the right,
and the those of you with a keen eye,
or more likely, those of you who have
been here for a while, we see a famil-
iar name running for the Presidential
position. The reason that the ICSMSU
elections are held separately from the
central union and faculty elections
is due to the nature of the Medical
School’s timetables.
Many are hoping for a strong turnout
in all elections this term, especially the

Candidates
GSA ones which have had difficulties
in the past with positions, including
the GSA Chair, not being filled until
the first term of the following aca-
demic term. This will also be the first
time that the newly formed Business
School Postgraduate representatives
within the GSA will be elected. Deputy
President (Education & Welfare), Han-
nah Theodorou, who orchestrated the
creation of the new roles, explained to
felix why the roles were created. She
said that: “There was little effective
representation of postgraduate stu-
dents within the two graduate schools,
particularly of postgraduate medical
students and postgraduate business
students.”
If you are interested in standing
for any of the positions, simply go to

stand for election. The builders having one of their many tea breaks outside the MDH

The Main Dining Hall will be closed
for renovation work until September
2009 as part of the Catering Services
refurbishment programme. The qual-
ity of the food coming out of the MDH
has been under scrutiny this year, after
they tried to run an oriental buffet that
generated some negative reviews from
the oriental students at Imperial.
As part of the overall refurbishment
work, the main Sherfield kitchen will
close on Saturday 27 June for a com-
plete renovation and replacement of
equipment including hobs, oven, fridg-
es and worktops. A temporary kitchen
is being created in the JCR in the space
currently occupied by the café bar and
fast food outlet, which will reduce seat-
ing in the JCR by a third. Delivery of the
catering service in the SCR, remaining
sections of the JCR and all other cater-
ing outlets will operate as normal.
The main Sherfield kitchen will reo-
pen on Monday 21 September 2009
which clearly means that it will be
closed during the Summer Ball when
the space is normally used for a variety
of acts and bar service.
Jane Neary, Assistant Director of
Commercial Services, when ques-
tioned about the timings of the work,
told felix that “the project has three
phases & the second two are for the
kitchen & stores which need relocat-
ing to half of the JCR over the Summer
months.”
The College has taken on a lot of stu-
dent input to the new menu, even tak-
ing them out for lunch, and felix hopes
that the final product will be better
than what they had before.
LOLCATZ of teH WEEK
Battle for the Ball:
Cosmo Jones win
first round
Kadhim Shubber
Deputy Editor
Last Thursday saw the 1st heat of the
Battle for the Ball competitiion in
which Imperial’s musicians face-off to
win a spot supporting Athlete at the
Summer Ball. Cosmo Jones, Arun Rao
and Free Yard Jam played their hearts
out in dBs to a small crowd and the
three judges, Deputy President Han-
nah Theodorou, IC Radio supremo Ri-
chard Waldie and felix Deputy Editor
Kadhim Shubber.
Free Yard Jam opened with a heavy
rock sound and lyrics delivered with an
almost Southern drawl. Ross McAlpine
particularly impressed with his guitar
solos with Judge Hannah Theodorou
commenting “He’s dreamy...”. One ob-
server complimented his style saying
“Epic power stance”.
The mood changed drastically with
acoustic guitar artist Arun Rao. Armed
only with a guitar he built his songs
using a loop machine to add successive
layers of music. Judge Richard Waldie
obviosuly impressed, suggested at one
point to “Close your eyes and feel the
magic...”.
Finally pop-rock band Cosmo Jones
(who describe their music on their Fa-
cebook page as ‘(Cos)motown’...) jaunt-
ed onto stage. Their fun attitude got
the judge’s attention and their upbeat
melodies got the judge’s toes tapping.
Cosmo Jones, consisting of Spaden
Elmhirst (Bass, Vocals); Rob Wall
(Drums, Vocals) and Mick Morrison
(Guitar, Vocals), ultimately took first
prize because the judges decided that
the band’s music and energy would
best suit an opening act of the Summer
Ball and get people dancing.
The 2nd heat will be on the 14th of
May, after this issue is sent to print so
check out next week’s felix to see the
results. There is one more heat on the
21st of May in dBs before the grand fi-
nals on the 29th of May.
One of President Obama’s key election pledges, legislation to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from US industry, is making progress.
The House of Representative, the lower house of Congress, is currently de-
bating a bill on climate-change, which includes a “cap and trade” system, the
first of its kind in America. Negotiations have produced some compromises
in order to gain approval of Democrat and Republican members whose states
rely on coal or heavy industry. The vote on the bill is expected next week,
and if it passes, it must still be debated in the Senate, the upper house, before
becoming law.
The Obama administration wants to push this bill through so the US has a
legislative framework for regulating emissions before December 2009. This
is when the UN Climate Change conference will take place in Copenhagen,
to draft a follow-up agreement to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol which the US
infamously did not ratify.
