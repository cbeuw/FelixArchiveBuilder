Going Underground
Team Shotgun bring home to gold in
the underground game! The correct
answer last week was EAST PUTNEY,
and it’s a shit hole, never ever go there.
Here’s a hint, we’re not keeping the
spaces , if we did it would be too easy
now wouldn’t it. Deal with it!

So which London tube station sums to 182?
This week’s Cat Phone:
_ _ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Mentalist Maze...
Oh, so now you decided to actually
do the mentalist maze. I commend
you Nick “Princess Diana” Jones.
However, he said he doesn’t want the
points because there’s no point, he
won’t win. That’s the attitude of a loser.
Sit down, shut up and sort your life out.
If you always quit you’ll never win.

It’s all over the place this week. The
leading individuals entry, Giramondo,
got the points this week. Only six more

Nonogram 1,432
How to play:
Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells
in a grid have to be coloured or left blank ac-
cording to numbers at the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many unbroken
lines or filled-in squares there are in any given
row or column. Look at the solution for help.
Team Shotgun have won the Nonogram for a
second week running. It seems like they have
come back and are actually giving MÖchten
sie mein Manschaft a run for their money.
Not that many weeks left folks, so keep those
answers coming in.

Hangman
Exclusive interview with
ICU’s new ‘Jock King’
T
o sort out the expense’s
crisis and deal with the
burgeoning number of
clubs and societies at Im-
perial, the Union has cre-
ated the new position of Jock King.
Hangman interviews Mr John Smith
(a well established beverage maker)
about the new role.
Hangman
Mr Smith, you are the new Jock King
at ICU and you’ve come down from the
wilderness that is Yorkshire to tackle
the Union’s problems. How are you
feeling about the new role
John Smith
Oi! what dya mean wilderness, it’s
bloody picturesque, as the french
would say. But aye, I’m feeling bloody
great. Mainly cos you all drink me beer,
you swallow it by the ball sack load!
You’re one of me best customers and
the thought of loosing that would end
me.
Hangman
Ball sack load?
John Smith
Yeah, every barrel of me beer gets
a little something special, something
only I can provide... ohhh yes...
Hangman
Right, let’s ignore that and move
onto the clubs you have. What are your
thoughts?
John Smith
Well we’ve got t’everythin you could
possibly want; Thug’r’us? to Stick and
Ball to Cock Soc and Spock Soc.
Hangman
Thug’r’us? Stick and Ball? Cock Soc?
Spock Soc? I’ve never heard of any of
these societies.
John Smith
Oh aye, sorry you geeks probably
call them by their normal names: foot-
ball, hockey, meat soc, and sci fi... you
bunch of boring bastards. There’s
something to cater to everyone’s tastes,
even if your tastes are dogging in the
Hyde Park, we’ve got a club that will
subsidise you!
Hangman
Erm, we don’t actually have a Dog-
ging society here, although I hear the
Medics have tried in the past.
John Smith
Wrong, just set it up now! Me and
me Yorkshire mates are gona have a
wicked time!
Hangman
Whadafuh?! How is that a good
spend of Union money? You’re taking
liberties and abusing your position.
John Smith
Ah you’re just an old prude. Don’t
worry it’s still early days, I haven’t
moved money from other clubs yet.
The expenses for dogging are quite
high y’know.
Hangman
(sigh), ok I’ll bite, how? How in Je-
hovah’s name could dogging could cost
a lot of money?
John Smith
Well fura start ye have to bribe the
rozzers. Then ye need to pay for the
johnnys and sometimes ye gota hire an
‘escort’...
Hangman
...hang on, we can help there, the
DPEW has a load of johnnys in her
office and you know... while you’re
there...
John Smith
Right, so we can save sum money
there, but still, paying off the cops is
the major point here.
Hangman
Ok ok, where is this money coming
from? Most societies are already op-
erating on a shoestring, you can’t cut
their budgets.
John Smith
I think u’ll find that I can. I’m da wan
in charge of the budget fur the socie-
ties. I can do what I like, like. Sure I
chatted to the President of Dog Soc
and he made a very strong argument
fur giving his club lots of money and
fucking other societies in the arse.
Hangman
Aren’t you the President of Dog Soc?
John Smith
I know. I can be quite persuasive
when I want to be.
Hangman
Right, we’re doomed.
Next week Hangman interviews the
Head of Piss and Shit (Food & Drink)
ACC Chair and Treasurer in
expenses controversy
The Athletic Clubs Committee (ACC)
has become embroiled in an expenses
scandal that threatens to rock Imperial
to its very core.
A Hangman investigation (by inves-
tigation we mean, reading the news
section of felix - see Page 4) has found
that ACC Chair Sam Furse has wil-
fully misappropriated ACC funds for a
range of expenses.
Private documents discovered (fab-
ricated) by the Hangman team show
that Mr Furse claimed £3,000 for horse
stockings, £250 for horse lipstick and
£22,000 on medical appointments con-
cerning anal fissures.
Other expenses include holiday trips
to Mongolia for Mr Furse and an as yet
unidentified Mr A. Horse.
Hangman’s crack team of investiga-
tive reporters (reporters on crack) cor-
nered Mr Furse at the Mayfair branch
of Wetherspoons. When questioned
about the claims, he spluttered into
his glass of Veuve Clicquot, “Those
expenses were justified and entirely
within the rules!” before calling to the
waiter, “Hey, Geoffrey, get rid of this
pisswater of a champagne and bring
me the Shipwrecked 1907... umm put
it on the tab, you know the A.C... you
know which one I mean”.
Hangman’s team of sleuths (sloths)
were unable to track down ACC Treas-
urer Joseph Lees. His personal sec-
retary, Mrs Lees (who is paid by the
ACC), informed Hangman that he was
on a fact-finding mission on budget-
ing practices in Harare, Zimbabwe.
The mission, funded by ACC, included
meetings with top government officials
including Gideon Gono, the Governor
of Zimbabwe’s Central Reserve Bank
and President Robert Mugabe who ap-
parently congratulated Mr Lees on “A
job well done”.
ACC Chair-elect Chaaarrlie Murdo-
ch (the douchebag who conjures up the
puzzles) has promised to clean up the
ACC, “I’m going to usher in an era of
austerity and thrift, no more gold plat-
ed toilet seats. The ACC Chair should
be able to look Imperial students in the
eye and say ‘Silver is good enough’”
Other expenses uncovered by
Hangman
£3,000 on industrial strength
•
lubricant
£2,250 on “Horse-sized
•
condoms”
£30,000 on a horse shaped gimp
•
suit
£12,000 on 2 pairs of ‘horse-
•
proof’ hoofcuffs
£300 on metal piercing
•
(thats enough horse sex jokes, Ed)
Imperial students invited
to genocide themselves...
“Make this
summer
different”... You
know because
you spent every
other summer of
your life having
fun with friends,
holidaying
with family
and generally
avoiding ethnic
cleansing.
See you in
September, I’m
sure you’ll have
lots of stories to
tell. Or maybe
I’ll just read your
diary...
T
his summer the com-
pany behind The Kill-
ing Fields, The Siberian
Gulags and the now
‘controversial’ Armenian
holiday camp is offering Imperial stu-
dents a unique opportunity to experi-
ence genocide first hand.
The so-called Thai work-camp
promises 2 months of back breaking
hard work and torture at a secret lo-
cation in Thailand.
Accomodation is reported to be
‘sub-standard’ and they promise to
help attendees lose weight by ‘not
feeding them’.
Where previous camps saw the or-
ganisers coerce people into attend-
ing, this new strategy marks a bold
move for the company. If successful
there are plans to roll the scheme out
in countries like The Congo and the
Outer Scottish Hebrides. Hangman
thinks this scheme couldn’t reach the
latter quick enough.
“I’m looking forward to the
camp! I’ve nothing better to do
this summer so why not?”
Mugabe’s lawyers have instructed us to state that this photo is faked
and at no point did he ever meet Joseph Lees.
