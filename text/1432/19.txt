Imperial Cricket was in full flow this
weekend and by Sunday morning had
already recorded two wins without
even having played a game. Teams just
didn’t want to play us. That said, we
knew that Sunday would prove more
difficult as we faced a Brunel 1st XI still
undefeated in BUCS competition.
We fielded a strong XI and opted to
bat first in glorious sunshine on a flat
wicket. We’d flown Srisai in a week be-
fore as our overseas player and confi-
dence was high when he thumped first
bowl of the innings over mid-on’s head
for four. However, when he tried to re-
peat the shot later in the over things
didn’t quite go so well, and he spurned
a catch to mid-on this time. Luckily
mid-on was polite enough to drop it.
Not quite so lucky was Matt Tarr who
found himself victim to a straight pull
from Srisai the next over. He moved
right, then left before deciding to stop
the ball with his tummy. “Good job
he’s a fat *******” was the shout. I won’t
name the player who shouted this, but
needless to say “he ain’t too trim him-
self”. Matt, clearly riled by banter from
his own team, went next over as one
looped up off the shoulder of his bat.
Srisai was joined by Majid at the
crease and both were in full flow. Un-
fortunately, for every boundary they
scored, they shared a chance with the
fielding side and it wasn’t long before
both had thrown their wickets away for
identical scores of 27 runs.
I then found myself at the crease
with Ali Najefi, both of us prematurely
disturbed from much needed revision.
We battled through the next few overs
against two good spells of bowling be-
fore Ali feathered one behind when
on 13. As you might expect I played a
sparkling innings and it wasn’t until I
got a leading edge on 44 that I had to
return to the pavilion. Unfortunately, a
few other wickets had tumbled by then
for not many runs and it was thanks to
some good batting at the tail that we
managed to string together a defend-
able total of 172 all out.
Tea followed and after the interval
we started brightest. Zirgham Afridi
worked hard for two early wickets, but
Brunel made steady progress in reply.
Ahsaan Ismail bowled some jaffers at
the other end, too good for players at
our level yet not good enough for the
wicket. Brunel’s next partnership was a
long one (and boring). They trimmed
to deficit to 70 before Rajiv “Jeeves”
Shah got the breakthrough, caught and
bowled. After arranging and rearrang-
ing his hair with the aid of an Alice
band he even got another wicket a few
overs later.
Daniel Johnpillai was on at the other
end and zipping through his overs. He
always looked good for a wicket and

he got it next over when I took THE
best catch you’ve ever seen. Most read-
ers will unfortunately have missed this,
so if you’re in this group I’ve saved a
mental picture of the whole thing (and
framed it). Ask me anytime. Jeeves
continued at the other end and took a
wicket next over as the batsman skied
one to Zirgham at mid-on for a catch I
had money on him dropping. Did I say
I was always right? Unfortunately the
new batter was a full-on slogger. Ugly
as you like but effective. DJ felt the
pain more than the other bowlers and
Brunel ran home to a 3 wicket victory.
This has made things difficult now for
BUCS promotion and this was just an-
other case of not enough runs.
Textbook solid defense from the backbone of the team, Shiraz Sabah
