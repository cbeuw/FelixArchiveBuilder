Evil speculators conspire against
honest automotive workers
Contributing writer Sina Ataherian takes a look at the fate of the American car industry giant Chrysler.

W
hen we become
poorer, or feel like
we are about to, one
of the last things we
wish to buy is a car.
So for American car companies, crip-
pled by debt even before the current
downturn, to be finding times hard is
no surprise. Chrysler has entered bank-
ruptcy, and will re-emerge under Fiat.
GM is now attempting to get agree-
ment on voluntary restructuring, and
if this fails may soon follow Chrysler
into bankruptcy. Their combined loss
last year was $48 billion, with Ameri-
can car sales down from their annual
peak at 17 million to just 9 million this
year.
The United States government has
announced a “deal” to rescue Chrys-
ler. Secured creditors have been of-
fered 28% of the $7 billion that they are
owed. This is despite the auto workers’
healthcare fund being offered 43% of
its $11 billion, even though its claims
should legally come second to those of
the secured creditors. If GM follows
Chrysler into chapter 11, its creditors’
fortunes look no better. They have
been offered 5% of their $27 billion,
whilst the health-care trust will get
50% as well as significant shares in the
restructured company.
When unions agree to future prom-
ises made by their firm, they are specu-
lating that it will continue to exist. This
is no different from creditors agreeing
to promises that their debt will be re-
paid. Creditors who wish to reduce
their risk of counterparty default can
make sure they get first dibs on the as-
sets of a bankrupt firm. They do this
by accepting the lower interest paid
to ‘secured creditors’. The US govern-
ment now appears to be ignoring this
principle.
In setting this precedent, its biggest
victims may be those it has the greatest
responsibility to protect: those whose
survival is seen as, and therefore prob-
ably is, the most important to the gov-
ernment. This is especially true at a
time when it wants the private sector
to invest $1 trillion in its Term Asset
Backed Securities Loan Facility. This
is needed if lending to consumers and
small business is to restart. Further-
more, the vilified creditors include
pension funds and individuals, many of
whom are themselves members of the
United Auto Workers Union (UAW),
who also happened to be Chrysler
creditors.
However, there is a plausible defence
for the deal: that the creditors are be-
ing offered a fair price. Perhaps 28
cents per dollar of secured borrowing
is all that would come out of liquidat-
ing Chrysler. This theory continues
that hedge funds know how hard the
US government will try to save Chrys-
ler, and presumably also GM when the
time comes. They will even be will-
ing to grossly over-value the UAW’s
claims to avoid strike action, even if
this makes whatever the creditors get
appear too little by comparison.
But the funds can also see how much
the government will try to avoid loss
of creditor confidence of exactly the
sort likely here. So they are holding out
for more than their fair share. By this
account, they are using the same tac-
tics of economic terrorism that other
financial institutions used to secure
their multi-billion-dollar bail-outs.
This theory sounds somewhat para-
noid and created after then fact. But
the incentive would certainly exist and
it is difficult to dismiss without the
sort of consideration that it should be
afforded during bankruptcy proceed-
ings. This leads to the next problem.
The Chrysler bankruptcy judge has
agreed to a speedy process, giving lit-
tle chance for creditors to advocate
liquidation of the company’s assets. So
the problem is not that Chrysler and
the US government have identified
the problems of liquidation, including
for the creditors. The issue is that they
convinced the judge that liquidation
would be so much worse than the ex-
isting deal, even for the creditors, that
it cannot even be considered.
There is yet another political dimen-
sion to this; not only do many lenders
now feel ripped off, they are simulta-
neously being blamed for the problems
of the auto industry. This sort of de-
monising, especially given how much
of it is currently going on anyway, has
the potential to multiply the damage
that the whole affair does to creditors’
confidence.
Many people will find it difficult to
sympathise with the hedge funds, hav-
ing trouble with their cut-throat prac-
tice and wealth. But it is not the point.
When a market is distorted there are
two losers.
Creditors will lose out from in-
creased perception of risk. But so will
the consumers and businesses that are
now so in need of their credit.
Business news quarterly digest
It’s about a month late, but since we’ve
been away for the duration of the holi-
days, the business section has put to-
gether a quarterly digest to cover all
the major economic bases from the
last three months. If you’re heading to
a job interview, it’s just what the doctor
ordered.
New Bail Outs
The bank of England has declared
that it will keep interest rates at 0.5%
and will be printing £50bn to inject
into the banking system. At the mo-
ment, the Bank of England is set to in-
ject a total of £125bn into the financial
system by June (including the new in-
crease). The bulk of this new injection
will be delivered to banks by buying up
corporate and government bonds. Cur-
rently Her Majesties Treasury owns
70.33% of the Royal Bank of Scotland
and 43% of Lloyds Banking Group plc,
which in turn wholly owns HBOS. This
new bailout plan was triggered when
news surfaced that the toxic assets held
by HBOS were significantly larger than
previously thought. The Governor of
the Bank of England, Mervyn King said
that the central bank may need up to
£150bn over the course of its “quanti-
tative easing” programme, and stated
that he believed the economy a long
way from recovered. The city generally
applauded the move, with several chief
economists stating their approval of
the BOE’s “realistic” approach to deal-
ing with the crisis.
Green Shoots and Red Herrings
Nationwide Building Society claims
that last month UK consumer con-
fidence has experienced its biggest
increase in two years with the serv-
ice sector shrinking by its smallest
amount since August 2008. The 12
month change in Consumer Price In-
dex for the first quarter fell to 3.0%
compared with 3.9% in the last quar-
ter of 2008 and over the same period
the Retail Price index fell from 2.7% to
-0.1%. RPI excluding housing also fell
from 4.2% to 3.3% indicating a medium
term decrease in inflation of consum-
able goods. It is clear that the housing
price drop and low interest rates have
led to deflation in the RPI and is the
main cause of deflationary pressure.
The UK’s trade deficit also decreased
from £2.8bn in February to £2.5bn in
March – much better than predicted.
Considering the decreases in domes-
tic manufacturing, the narrowing has
been assumed to be to product of the
weaker pound - which has remained
under $1.6 for all of 2009 – and re-
duced demand for foreign goods in the
recessional market.
The FTSE 100 has risen for the last
three months from 3500 at the start of
March to almost 4500 last week. This
rise has been echoed by the Dow Jones
(which rose from just under 7000 to
roughly 8500 over the same period) the
German Dax (3600 to 4800), the Mum-
bai Stock Exchange (8000 to 12000) and
the Nikkei 225 (7000 to 9200). Few seri-
ous forecasters have taken this to mean
that the recession has shown signs of
reversing, identifying the gains as a
“suckers rally”. During the 2000-2002
bear market there were three similar
rises averaging 21% over 45 days and
the Great Depression experienced six
rises, averaging 47% each.
Some analysts (such as Peter Schiff
the head of Euro Pacific Capital, Inc)
believe that the root cause of the stock
market booms is the volatility in the
value of currencies. Indeed, with com-
modity prices also increasing over the
last quarter and the average value of
US Dollars, Euros and Pounds losing
ground to less recession sensitive cur-
rencies (like the New Zealand Dollar),
it would seem credible that people are
buying into stocks because they are
perceived to be less volatile that cur-
rencies – especially when central banks
are prone to printing money. Given the
tailing off of stock price gains over the
last week, it would seem that this trend
may be about to reverse.
New Budget
After a delay, the Government un-
veiled its new budget last month which
included a 50% tax rate on people who
earn over £150,000, up from 45% last
year. Fuel duty will increase by 2p per
litre and alcohol duty will increase by
2% (about a penny on a pint) and ciga-
rettes will see a 7p increase. Overall
measures will raise tax income by £6bn
by 2012, however by 2013 total govern-
ment spending is expected to exceed
taxation by 79% of GDP, a statistic that
was widely hailed as disastrous by op-
position Parties. The budget was also
underpinned on extremely optimis-
tic economic forecasts that predicted
growth of 1.25% in 2010 and 3.5% in
2011. Most forecasts estimate 2010’s
growth to be closer to 0.9%. The gov-
ernment also expected decreases in
CPI and PRI over the course of the
year as a result of lower food and en-
ergy prices – a prediction that remains
widely uncontested.
Overall the budget was poorly re-
ceived by the markets, which fell, the
public who pushed Labour behind in
the polls and political parties with Nick
Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats
saying that Labour “have condemned
us to years of unemployment and dec-
ades of debt”.
