Extinguisher Mayhem Obituary
BY MIKE INGRAM
Crime at Imperial College is again in
the spotlight after an assault
occurred in the Union Building.
Several members of the Chess
Club were attacked in one of the
committee rooms on the top floor.
The incident took place at about
11:25pm on 9th March.
Three people forced their way
into the room and sprayed the occu-
pants with water-containing fire
extinguishers. One of the victims, a
Mr Moody, challenged the group
and was kicked in the groin. He was
assaulted again outside the Union
Office after attempting to stop the
group escaping.
The assailants drove off in a
black Ford Fiesta, whose registra-
tion number was taken down.
However, when it was checked, the
number was found to belong to a
white Honda motorcycle. Police
have descriptions of the assailants,
and are following up the incident.
College Security urge anyone
who has been the victim of any
crime to contact them on ext 3372.
DoC Rated 'Excellent'
We weren't aware of Whiskas' birth.
To go back to basics, he was an
abandoned child. During a long, hot
summer of animal right activism in
Biology, of all places, Whiskas the
mouse was found scuttling across
Beit Quad.
What was this creature? Did it
have some terminal virus? Some
hideous disease? Who cares? He
was, after all, the same height as the
editor who found him two years ago
and, at three in the morning, a consid-
erable force to be reckoned with.
His first home was a bucket. A
Pentel box as a bed and bountiful
supplies of blu-roll enabled him to
live a life of considerable luxury.
However, his true status as life presi-
dent of Felix was proved when he
graduated to an enormous, palatial
cage. Us hacks were truly scared of
him - the grisly demise of the cage's
former owner was never reported.
I never saw Whiskas during the
day - no bad thing as dispatches say
he was nocturnal. Most, indeed all,
news stories were written to the sweet
accompaniment of crunching
sunflower seeds, sucking sounds from
the water bottle and mouse pee.
Sometimes he was let out into the
community, allowed to roam over
desks and stand as a sabbatical
candidate. His bid for stardom was
thwarted by mere pedants. Whiskas
died last week, the eminence gris of
Felix.

The Department of Computing has
been rated 'excellent' by the Higher
Education Funding Council for
England (HEFCE).
The Department received this
rating for its teaching standard
following a three day assessment
from the council. Professor Tom
Maibaum, Head of the Department,
told Felix: "We deserve it and our
students think that we deserve it."
The success follows that of the
Chemistry Department and the
Management School earlier this
academic year. Vernon McClure,
Academic Registrar, commented:
"For an institution which is perceived
to be research orientated, to have it
confirmed that its undergraduate
teaching is excellent is terrific."
Womens' Club
A new social club for women will be
initiated tonight in the Union Bar.
Named 'Vixens', the club intends
to give women the opportunity to
meet other female students, past and
present. According to its organisers,
Rag Chair Jane Hoyle (Bio II) and
RCSU Ents Chair Karen Barnes (Bio
II), the club is not a dedicated
'drinking club'. They say that people
they have called it "a good idea" and
"long overdue". The organisers can
be contacted through the RCSU or
Rag or via departmental pigeonholes.
