Art...Who? Us?
"They're below average size,
she said.
You're beautiful,
I said.
Not so bad yourself,
she said,
but looked at the floor.
We took out our lenses."
excerpt from Phoenix 1994
Short memories or end of term fever? Whatever
is racing through your head, don't forget about
Phoenix, the annual arts magazine of Imperial
College. Already there is a steady stream of
material to the pigeonhole in F E L i X but still
there is space for that wildly erratic poem, the
one you've had in your mind for an age and
never bothered to write. But don't limit yourself
to poems. Go for something new; drawings,
graphics, short scripts, photographs or the odd
lump of sparkling prose.
The deadline for work is now the beginning
of next term leaving the gorgeous desert of
Easter ahead. The five chapter headings are
shown on the left, with their respective egg
icons. A couple of broad individuals have even
written a piece for each chapter. Time to think
and act. There are also still opportunities for
artists who want to design the five frontispieces.
You can come and see us in FELiX or talk to
Owain on e-mail: ojb@ic.doc.uk.

HAPPINESS
Can science create Heaven on Earth?
Come and hear how a technology of consiousness provides a tried and tested solution
to crime, terrorism and other intractible social problems. Listen to how it integrates the
most advenced scientific and the most ancient understandings of man and the universe
"The peer-reviewed literature provides statistically highly
significant support for the claim that a marked, socially
benificial influence can result from large gatherings
practising the T M and the TM-Sidhi programmes.
Moreover, the speed of the response and the distance over
which it is experienced would seem to rule out explanations
based on a chain of personal contacts. These results, which
are so completely contrary to one's expectations and yet
potentially so important, should be approached with an open
mind, and further studies by independent researchers should
be supported to check and explore this effect" - James
Lawton, Visiting Professor of Chemical Engineering,
Imperial College
