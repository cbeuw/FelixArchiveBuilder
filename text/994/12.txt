M.Sc. in Renewable Energy Systems Technology
CREST is a new centre which was established to undertake
education and research in renewable energy. A new M.Sc.
course is planned to run from October 1994, to provide an
advanced level of education and practical training to all viable
renewable energy technologies and related topics. Electricity
generation and integration will be the main theme running
through the course. The course will incorporate the best
European practice and will be taught by internationally
acknowledged experts from both Loughborough and other
universities, research institutions and industry in the UK and
Europe.
There will be an opportunity to pursue project work
abroad during the second half of the course. Applicants
should generally have a first degree in engineering or physics,
but graduates with degrees in other technical or numerate
subjects may well also be eligible.
A limited number of studentships for the top candidates
are available from CREST and other sponsoring bodies.
For a brochure on CREST, application form and details on
studentships, please contact the CREST Director:
