Feature S
In April 1993, following M P G approval, the College
placed a contract with Ericsson Ltd for the supply of a
new digital telephone exchange and the total recabling of
all buildings on the South Kensington site.
Work started on cabling in May 1993 and the new
system will be ready for service on 29th April 1994, at
which time it can be used for internal calls and incoming
calls to DDI (direct line) extensions.
The new system will then run in parallel with the old
system for eight weeks to allow for familiarisation,
testing and user training. The new system will be brought
into full operation on Saturday 25th June and the old
system decommissioned. Until 24th June all calls to TI
071 589 5111 will be received on the old system and all
outgoing external calls will continue to be made on the
old system. From 25th June 071 589 5111 will be
received on the new system and the lines will be opened
for outgoing traffic.
During the parallel running period, staff will have
both the new and old handsets on their desks and will be
encouraged to use the new system for internal calling and
make use of their DDI facility. It will not be possible to
make a call from a new extension to an old one. The new
system will be brought into service with over 38,000
extensions, 8,000 more than currently exist, with
significant growth potential for the future.

Phoneday - National Code Change
The national code change day is on 16th April 1995. this
is the day that the whole country will have the digit '1'
placed after the leading zero in all dialling codes e.g. 071
will become 0171. In actual fact the new London codes
will be operational sometime in the April of this year
with official parallel running of both old an new STD
codes starting on 1st August 1994. Due to lack of
available telephone numbers, six cities are being given
new codes and the international access code will change
from 010 to 00 in line with most European countries.
It is probably better to assume that the new codes are
effective from August this year and remember that 16th
April 1995 is the day that the old codes stop working.
This is an important point to note if you publish existing
DDI numbers. Therefore any advanced literature,
publications, stationery etc could accommodate any of
the new DDI numbers and the national code change to
avoid the need to change these twice.
If you have any queries now please contact the
Telecom project office on extension 8582.

What type of extension do you have?
The new five-digit extension numbers will start with a 4
or a 5. If your number begins with a 4, you have a DDI
facility and external callers can dial you direct to the
desk bypassing the telephone operator. To use this
facility you must prefix your number with 017159. So, if
you extension is 48000 then external callers can reach
you by dialling 0171 594 8000. However, if you number
begins with a 5 you do not have this facility and external
callers can only contact you via the operator on 0171 589
5111. Each department appointed a representative to
assign extension numbers, user facilities and provide
information for the new telephone directory.
The new telephone directory will be available at the
end of April and is designed as an interim measure for
the new system and to see us through the following six
months. A directory will continue to be compiled
throughout the summer. When the directory is
distributed, if you entry is missing or incorrect please let
the Switchboard Supervisor, on 49897, know as well as
your departmental representative.
