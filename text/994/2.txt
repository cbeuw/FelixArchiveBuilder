Sabbatical Elections Results
BY THE NEWS TEAM
This year's Imperial College Union
(ICU) Sabbatical Elections have
shocked candidates and bystanders
alike.
Following the casting of over
seven thousand votes, the much
feared St Mary's block vote seems
to have lost the 'king-maker' power
which has marked recent elections.
The number of votes also caused
problems, with the first counts only
finished at 10:30pm. Those
involved in the count spent six
hours poring over ballot papers.
After the results, Steve Dunton, one
of those counting, said: "It's been
very tiring."
The greatest surprise occurred in
the race for the Presidency. At the
first count, St Mary's support put
New Election in second place to
Lucy Chothia. Paul Thomas,
expected to be one of the stronger
contenders, had the least votes.
After the re-allocation of M r
Thomas's votes, the result was still
undecided. It was only after the
second reallocation (of Kamran
Bashir's) votes, that Lucy Chothia
was declared the winner with 870
votes.
Commenting to Felix on the way
forward, Miss Chothia said: "I am
going to start talking about the
second-hand bookshop now,
because that is something that I can
work on, not being in power,
without treading on someone's
toes."
In the other elections, the job of
the Mary's vote was merely one of
confirmation. A l l of the victors
secured a sufficient majority of
votes without the Mary's block. In
addition, all of the other posts were
decided on the first count. The
victorious candidates are: Dan
Look, Deputy President-elect
(Finance & Services), the winner
with a margin of 111 votes; Ian
Parish, Deputy President-elect
(Clubs & Societies), claiming a
margin of 21 votes and Owain
Bennallack, Felix Editor and Print
Unit Manager-elect, sporting a
margin of 337 votes. The over-
whelming mandate given to M r
Bennallack would have resulted in a
win even if his 336 Mary's votes
had gone to Joe McFadden.
Those elected will take up their
posts on the 1st July. The current
Sabbaticals finish their employment
on the 31st July, following a one
month 'change-over' period. The
importance of training has been
stressed by ICU President Andrew
Wensley. Andrew Wensley, Returning Officer, on his way to announce the results
