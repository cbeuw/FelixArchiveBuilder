Welcome friends. To coincide with our 'Gangster special'
GFQQ, I tried to write a mafia-themed crossword. Unfortunately, the
logistics were too damn difficult so I gave up in the end. There are a cou-
ple of clues that relate to the Cosa Nostra but that's about it. If you're
interested, King's College are holding free screenings of classic films on
Mondays and Tuesdays for all University of London students from now
until mid-March. Monday nights will be American gangster movies and
Tuesdays will have a range of themes. Details are in last week's Time
Out in the student section, so root out your copy if you've still got it. I've
had only one entry to this week's crossword, so the winner is
Somsuddin A l i . I don't know if it was too hard or you've just lost inter-
est, but remember there is a playstation 2 on offer at the end of the year
and every time you hand in a correct grid you get one more entry in the
tombola. I tell you what, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse. This
week, either your brains or your answers are gonna end up on the grid.
Capish?
