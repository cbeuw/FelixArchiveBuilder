LSE 4
Indeedy. There were only 9 of
us playing in this Sunday morn-
ing match, due to reasons
beyond our control. LSE had a
full team, complete with sub,
three coaches and someone's
mum to support. I am not a bet-
ting woman, but I would say
that the odds were against us!
After about 15, a great pass
to Teens gave US the first goal!
The crowd (someone from
LSE's mum) was silenced, and
we realised that despite being
two women down, we could
damed-well win this thing!
Our stunning second goal by
Maewie-baby (her first for IC!)
seemed to put a confused LSE
into panic mode, and rightly so,
because by anyone's stan-
dards, we were wirrning!
Oh, but then they got one
back. No matter though,
because by half-time, another
smooth attack and a beautiful
strike by Teens had made the
score 3-1 to us. Nice!
We geared ourselves up for a
gruelling second half, in which
the strong wind would now be
against us. LSE, having been
shouted at by their three coach-
es, piled on the pressure - espe-
cially in central midfield, giving
Iona lots of work to do. Goalie
Anneke had to make several
excellent saves. But despite our
best defensive efforts, with Mo,
Rim, and Claire coping com-
mendably, they scored after
about fifteen minutes of relent-
less attacking.
Another scrappy LSE goal
late in the half, and suddenly,
we found ourselves at 3-3 with
4 minutes left. Exhausted by
our efforts so far, we gave it our
all to try and get the winning
goal. Twice, our strikers Louise
and Teens came achingly close
to getting the fourth, but it
wasn't to be. What was to be
was an unimpressive, wind-
assisted LSE goal, and the final
whistle being blown, in a seem-
ingly very short space of time.
So there you have it. In the
end, I think we had a bit too
much to do. LSE got far more
than they bargained for with
the nine of us, so well done
everyone!!
Ladies' Rugby
Sunday 20th January
A soggy start to this term
down at Honour Oak Park
ended with a disappointingly
soggy score. We fought hard
but the highlights of the day
were the giant bath and
sausage (or vegeburgers! - Lu),
beans and chips to follow.
Never mind girlies, things can
only get better.
Wednesday 23rd January
With our spangly new line-out
calls, fantastic scrums and
wonderfully brilliant team, w e
trekked to Harlington ready to
whoops some Royal Holloway
ass. The massive turnout at
Monday's training session
payed off to make today's
match some of the best rugby
we've played this season. We
even had a sub and two fab
supporters who rallied round
when times got tough with a
few choruses of "ICU Babes!
Shaking that ass!"
Quote of the match from
Holloway's front row: "It hurts,
ow!" - well, it is a scrum, ladies.
Injury of the match goes to an
inanimate object! Thank you to
all those who played and sup-
ported, and let's make it an
even better one next week!
Well the year shot off to an
impressive start giving us
another victory. Unusually
the weather w a s on our side
but the court w a s ugly. A s
well as the mounds of gravel
there were also several used
sparklers lying around. So
when slipping on the gravel
(which I managed quite a
lot) w e then h a d to avoid
landing on a sparkler and
impaling ourselves! Rumours
are the netball courts are
home to closet sparkler
users! A n y w a y back to the
match, the game started fair-
ly messy but w e soon gelled
back together and by the last
quarter the goals were flying
in, excellent attack from
Mills, Jo and Jen! The umpire
however w a s not so good,
any attempt from our side to
touch the ball led to us being
pulled up for some reason.
Common examples were;
catching the ball perfectly,
running too fast towards the
ball and finally for landing on
our feet. However the other
team managed not to get
pulled up for throwing their
weight at us and starting to
play basketball half w a y
through! No bias there then!
Hats off to Sherry w h o got
the most of the umpire's b a d
side for basically being too
tall! O h well w e still ham-
mered them! So to sum up it
was netball on rollerskates,
with a blind umpire but w e
kicked a**e!
