Fortune Favours The Brave
The defeat of Saturday 20th
January 2001 (over a year ago
now) was the last time that the
ICUAFC third team was beaten,
by anyone. Saturday the 19th of
January 2002 and IC 3rds
played Kings 2nds to stay in the
ULU reserves cup and to keep
their incredible unbeaten run
intact...
Kings were a bit late arriving
to Harlington and turned out in
mismatched kit and a couple of
obvious ringers. Despite this,
the first fifteen minutes of the
game were all about the 3rds.
Chances came and went think
and fast but the ball just would-
n't seem to hit the back of the
net. Jaime hit a post, Gabba had
a goal disallowed and Iain went
close. This scared Kings into
waking up and they started to
produce a couple of chances
themselves and only the inter-
vention of Ricky in our goal and
the inside of the post kept the
scores even.
Finally the deadlock was bro-
ken in our favour. Sherlock got
round the back of the defence,
crossed to Steakhouse who,
rather than take it round the
keeper, opted to square the ball
to Gabba who literally walked
the ball into the goal. The quite
ludicrously biased linesman
tried to give it offside but the
referee pointed out that if you
pass the ball to a player behind
you, he can't be offside.
Our second came from Gabba
again who was found space on
the right hand side of the area
and slotted the ball in past an
advancing keeper. We went into
the break 2 - 0 up and feeling
very confident. No changes
were made by us but Kings tried
to counter our dominance by
trying out our effective 3-5-2 for-
mation. This formation requires
an able and effective sweeper
which we had in the shape of
Dan. Kings did not have a good
sweeper and their defence was
a rickety as ever.
IC chances continued to be
churned out, Basis went close
with a free kick and a couple of
runs through the middle, but the
final touch was lacking. Lily
came on for Johnny and the
Hamster came on for Iain to con-
solidate our lead just before the
game took on its interesting
twist.
In a rare attack, Dhruve gave
away a free kick on the edge of
our area and when it was taken,
the wind got a hold of the ball
and unluckily, it lobbed Ricky. 2-
1 is far from safe and we were
nervous and felt robbed that
they had scored with their first
chance of the half but our
response was swift. Jamie took
the ball from inside our half, ran
all the way to the goal line and,
at full stretch, lobbed the keeper
from an impossible angle.
Quality.
Our fourth was sheer comedy.
They got a comer and, it being a
cup tie, their keeper went up for
it. Stupidly they played it short,
got caught in possession and
the ball was cleared. Their hap-
less keeper legged it back to his
goal unaware that the ball was
rolling only a couple of feet
behind him. Gabba sprinted
clear of the recovering defend-
ers to be first to the ball and,
when his shot was blocked, the
Hamster was on hand to knock
in the rebound.
It finished 4 - 1 . We drubbed a
team in the league above us to
stay in the cup.

IC 1st Team 4
ICSM 1st Team 0
IC ended their Liverpool-esque
run of eight games without a
w i n with a comprehensive
quality crushing of medics.
ICSM has little answer to IC's
tide of blue and white goal pie.
We arrived at the palatial
union at 11am for an early
pushback but were still wait-
ing at 11:30. We eventually
arrived at fortess Harlington as
we were due to push back, but
that didn't stop the monster IC
goal machine.
After a half of piss-taking,
Essex Wide Boy scored from
typically short range. Shortly
before Herpes' inspiring team
talk: "Pain is fleeting, chicks
dig scars and glory is forever!"
(What a tool!), Villager skillful-
ly placed the ball between the
keeper and the far post, a feat
he was to repeat at a similar
time in the second half.
After a spell of some total vil-
lage hockey, epitomised by
Gump trying to hatch out baby
hockey balls, IC decided that
the Medics has been out their
own half for long enough, and
an awesome team goal was
finished off from about a foot
by our resident Geography
Teacher.
Gump then pelted the ball
between the ICSM keeper's
legs. I think the phrase is 'nut-
meg'! Nice.
The scoring did not stop
there with Essex Wide Boy
scoring another rubbish goal,
before Villager repeated his
first half cock-up with another
spool of a mammoth propor-
tion.
We are legends!
