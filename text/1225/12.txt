You might like to consid-
er why Indie music trav-
els through the Universe
faster than sound itself. I
suspect the explosion of
laxative abuse in that
sub-culture, personally.
Whiplash!
Lashings, not of Devon-
creamy custard, but
instead of some pretty
heavy metal - like lead.
A lashing with lead is no
laughing matter, I'll
have you know.

Harry Potter a n d the
Projecter's Stoned
No longer able to cope
with the endless repeti-
tion, the cinematograph-
er has turned to drugs to
brigten his sad and dull,
if magical life.
Fellowship of the Ring
Not some obscure ritual
involving the liberation
of Baphomet, but
instead lots of special
effects and other things
that make it a block-
busting hit.

Marlena Shaw
She seems pretty popu-
lar, judging by the ticket
sales. That notwith-
standing, I'm still going
to be rude about her, but
in a very subtle way,
and after the end of the
O-Town
No need to wait until the
end of the square to be
rude about this lot. They
make Hear" Say look
serious... not to mention
that their punctuation is
so run-of-the-mill.
