Alternative M u s i c
Society
I'm not entirely sure
whether it's the music
or the society that's
alternative, but I'm sure
one is lower calorie than
the other...
Trivia Quiz
Hello. M y name's
Norman, and I'm inter-
ested in trivia. Hence,
therefore and thus, I am
able to w i n money in
DaVinci's on Tuesday.
Apparently.
Cheesy Wotsits
A chance to dance, fool-
ishly, with people you've
never met. Alternatively,
you could introduce your
friends to new random
people, a n d it could
start a new relationship!
Comedy
It's in dB's and it might
be funny, but not nearly
as funny as I am. If only
it were true, they could
throw a boiled haggis on
stage and get some
laughs.
Horny!
I've been told it's the
sexiest night in pop, but
I think fizzy orange is
probably the sexiest,
myself. A l l those bub-
bles a n d artificial
colourings. Yum... What?

Medics' H a g week,
w h i c h could b e mter-
preted as a woeful fail-
ure to s p e l l b u t may
otherwise be interpret-
ed as an amusing pun.
Behind Enemy Lines
The tagline is, apparent-
ly, "In War, There Are
Some Lines You Should
Never Cross." That incit-
ful piece of word-play
probably made someone
millions. Complain.
Mean Machine
No, it's not the printer in
your local friendly com-
puting room. This
machine is even meaner.
It has Vinnie Jones in it,
so a bit like everything
else he's done, I guess.
The Princess Diaries
"The hills are alive...", or
not, as it would be hor-
rid to type-cast poor old
Julie Andrews. Relive
the magic of Mary
Poppins in this popular
wedding romp.
Harry Potter a n d the
Baby-sitter Phoned
IMDB, not that this is
where we get our ideas,
only have five top films
for the week which is
inherently problematic
for a seven-day diary.
Fellowship of the Ring
I feel I should perhaps
explain the Baphomet
reference in the previous
'Fellowship' entry.
Unfortunately, I can't be
bothered, a n d I doubt
you can be either.

But seriously folks, can

but it could be funny,
couldn't it? Like youi

Mister Benn
Playing at the dominion,
maybe he'll go into the
fancy dress shop and do
something truly impres-
sive. I bet he's never
heard that one before.
Oh no.
Elizabeth Harper
She apparently plays
whistful 80s brit-pop
folk. I'm not entirely sure
what this is, but proba-
bly like Tinkerbell fid-
dling w i t h the Corr's
synthisizer.
Georgie Fame and the
Blue Flames
The Hammond organ
makes a fairly prominent
appearance in the write-
ups for this act, which
can't be b a d if you
remember James Taylor.
Lo-Fi Allstars
Ah, now I finally see, it's
a play on 'Hi-fi'. Having
been so pleased at
working this out, I went
on to prove that black
was white, and that I
read Douglas Adams.
Staind
I hate it when carpets
get that way. While that
kind of stain may take
some getting out, it'll
take little to get you out
to this concert. D'ya see
what I did there?
