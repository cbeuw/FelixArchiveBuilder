The Lord The World
Just seen the new box office
smash The Lord Of The Rings?
Nice, wasn't it? Fancy dressing
up in a black shirt now?
Because that's how the youth
arm of the Italian right-wing
National Alliance party want
you to feel.
They are pinning
their recruitment
hopes afresh on the
film, which they say
strongly resonates
with their o w n
ideals of "physical
strength, leader-
ship and integrity".
Their tradition dates back to
the 1970's, w h e n the first
Italian imprints of J.R.R.
Tolkien's celebrated fantasy
trilogy sparked a wave of mar-
tial fervour in young boys at
the time. A large increase in
part membership followed; as
a direct result, the fascists say.
While the party hopes for a
return to the chest-wigged
barnet-bearing glory days of
old, leftist commentators with-
in the Italian media and gov-
ernment have insisted that the
novel - written partially during
the Second World
War - may actually be
read as a cautionary
tale of fascist oppres-
sion, and of a collec-
tive (elves, men,
dwarves and hob-
bits) triumph over an
omnipotent evil (the
evil Sauron).
Tolkien, who died in 1973,
always insisted that there was
no political dimension to his
work, and sought to distance
himself from political interpre-
tations of the story, which he
considered to be more
mythopoeic in nature.

Junk
Thousands of tonnes of scrap
metal originally part of the
World Trade Centre are being
shipped to the Far East,
Reuters reports.
Nearly half a million tonnes
of scrap are to be
transported to
India and China,
where they will be
recycled and
reused for n e w
projects.
Steel salvaged *
form the gutted and pgj
destroyed building
is actually quite valuable, due
to its resistance to corrosion
and weathering.
As well as thousands of two-
foot thick girders from the shell
of the building, rescue and sal-
vage operations have also
yielded burnt yet usable items
of office furniture, such as
desks, filing cabinets and the
occasional Bauhaus-era all-
metal basket chair, all of which
survived the blast.
Zimbabwe
ANS: The eyes of the interna-
tional media con-
tinued to gaze
upon the former
colony of 1
Zimbabwe this
week, as the A R C I
(a body of fellow
African nations
ostensibly dedicat-
ed to championing n e w
democracies) declared its
acceptance of ruler President
Mugabe's electoral plans. The
78-year-old ruler has agreed to
hold elections this year to find
a n e w ruler, which he insists
will be free and democratic.
However, spectators have
called for Mugabe - who insti-
tuted the controversial 'land-
redistribution' policy that
parcels out land formerly
owned by white colonists to
blacks in the colony - to stand
down.
Though he insists the elec-
tions, to be held this May, will
be both fair and truly demo-
cratic, spectators have
expressed reservations.
Mugabe owns or con-
trols nearly all of the
state media in the
country, including
three T V channels
and seven of the
country's radio sta-
tions. With this con-
trol, the elections
could easily be
rigged, they say.

BBC: Beijing has announced
a series of arrests this week in
the Xinjiang region, in the
northwest of the country.
The arrests are said to be
connected w i t h extremist
Islamic terrorist cells suspect-
ed to be operating in the area.
The province is considered a
hotspot by the Chinese reli-
gious watchdogs; a series of
measures have been intro-
duced recently to clamp down
on growing numbers
of Christian and
Muslim "sects" in the
area.
Islamic groups in
Britain, however, con-
demned the moves,
insisting that the evi-
dence presented was
"flimsy and circumstantial".
