IC To Gain Independence
The Rector, Sir Richard Sykes,
has announced that the
College has applied to the
UK's Privy Council for
reserved powers to award its
own degrees and so become a
university in its own right.
The announcement was made
during the Rector's bi-annual
question-and-answer session
w i t h Imperial students on
18th January.
The College currently
awards degrees from the
University of London, a feder-
al institution described by the
Rector as " a conglomerate of
lots of damn things." If
awarded its o w n degree-
awarding status, Imperial
will no longer be associated
with the federation and its
union, U L U . It is thought that
IC could gain this independ-
ence w i t h i n the next five
years.
The push for IC to award its
o w n degrees is bound up
with the Rector's desire to
improve both public recogni-
tion and the reputation of the
College both in the UK and
further afield. Speaking to
Felix after the address, the
Rector confirmed his inten-
tion for the College to become
a university in its own right
and emphasised his belief
that the University of London
will see major changes over
the next five years: "It's not
just IC that's going down this
road. Other colleges, includ-
ing King's and U C L , are also
exploring doing the same."
Departure from U L U would
result in Imperial students
losing the benefits w h i c h
come w i t h membership.
Imperial College Union
President, Sen Ganesh,
warned that "if the union was
to disaffiliate from U L U , we
would need to ensure that we
get adequate compensation
Jjf * '
The Rector
for the loss of facilities and
services."
Speaking to Felix, U L U
President, Justine Stephens,
called Sir Richard Sykes'
plans for an independent IC
"a blow to the federal collec-
tivism that is the University of
London."
The Rector spoke at length
about strengthening the
Imperial College brand and
his belief that having its own
degree-awarding powers
would help to improve the
College's standing as a pres-
tigious international universi-
ty of the same calibre as
Oxford and Cambridge. A n
American student in the audi-
ence commented that
Imperial was almost unheard
of in the United States and
that he had to tell friends
back home that he was study-
ing at 'the University of
London' rather than 'Imperial
College'.
Other major issues of dis-
cussion were the College's
sports facilities, student
accommodation and the num-
ber of first-class degrees
awarded, which the Rector
said was being monitored, as
it was one of the key meas-
ures used in university league
tables.
The Rector also answered
questions regarding the
recently revised opening
hours of the Central Library
and the possible closure of
some departmental libraries.
He commented that library
provision across campus was
under review and that the
way in which students use
these facilities was being
monitored. He also answered
questions relating to the
College's new faculty struc-
ture, which is currently being
implemented.
The sale of the Teddington
sports ground later this year
was both confirmed and
explicitly linked to the fund-
ing of the sports hall at South
Kensington. Few medical stu-
dents were present and the
moment passed almost with-
out comment.
On the subject of accommo-
dation, the Rector confirmed
that Garden Hall will soon be
sold to provide funds for the
planned refurbishment of the
Southside halls, which is now
put at a cost of £25 million.
This will result in the loss of
around eighty-two bed-
spaces, however it is thought
that these will be mainly dou-
ble and triple rooms in the £35
to £50 per week price range.
There are plans to refurbish
the hall before it is sold in
order that it may achieve a
higher price.
The College's Strategic
Plan suggests that in order to
meet the guarantee of accom-
modation for all first year
undergraduate students,
replacement accommodation
w i l l be found in privately-
owned developments. In
response to questioning, the
Rector promised that stu-
dents who were housed by
the College i n . privately-
owned accommodation would
pay rents "controlled by the
College" and that they would
be " i n the same ballpark as
Beit and Southside...if it's

more than that it will only be

He also outlined his plans
for a new £14 million building
on Dalby Court to house the
administrative departments
that currently occupy
Sherfield. M u c h of the vacat-
ed space would be filled by
Computing and Maths, along
with provision for unspecified
"student facilities." The main
walkway will also be rebuilt
within the next three years in
an attempt to ease the con-
gestion that builds up as stu-
dents hurry between lec-
tures.
This was the second ques-
tion and answer session
given by the Rector after a
successful trial last year and
it is hoped that this method of
consultation with the student
population over his future
plans for the College will con-
tinue.
