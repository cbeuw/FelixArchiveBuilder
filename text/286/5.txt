When I first came down to
London I felt I knew what it
would be like. I had visions
of tradesmen bawling out
their wares on the pavements,
of flower sellers, the Queen
and George Dixon. Imagine,
then, my disappointment at
what I found. After living
here for two years I can hon-
estly say that if London
swings I wish it wouldn't be-
cause it makes my head ache.
It is Pop music that's the
cause of the trouble. Of
course one can't object to
The Carnival Concert this
year will be held in the Great
Hall instead of the usual Al-
bert Hall. The date is the
29th January, a fortnight's
time. Instead of the expected
series of groups such as ap-
peared at last year's disaster,
this concert will feature the
two young folk-singers Brid-
get St. John and Al Stewart.
other people listening to it
and in fact I've got nothing
at all against pop music in
principle, it's just that it
makes such an awful noise.
It contributes about ninety
five per cent of the noise in
London, the remainder being
supplied by the traffic and the
transatlantic jets. (If the alter-
native is Radio One, give me
a Boeing 707 any day.)
How I wish we could have
a law compelling manufac-
turer's to fit transistor radios

Bridget St. John (above) is
23 years old and has had one
record produced in this coun-
try " Ask Me No Questions".
She has the ability to project
in her songs her own dream
of the world, in a way which
communicates to each mem-
ber of the audience. Al Stew-
art is probably better known,
having had several records re-
ted with safety belts). What
bliss ! Except for the electric
guitars, of course. Now don't
get me wrong ! The electric
guitar can be a very effective
instrument (although nothing
like the real thing), but it can
be very dangerous in the
wrong hands and it often gets
into them.
The number of places in
which you can seek refuge
from noise decreases daily. In
one of the college toilets the
other day I was amazed to
hear the sound of Radio One
leased. He is an admirer of
Bob Dylan but is most in-
fluenced by Paul Simon and
Bert Jansch.
Tickets are 5/-, 7/6 and
10/- from the carnival office

don't ignore them, it should
be well worth the money.
emanating from one of the
cubicles. Only with the ut-
most difficulty can 1 refrain
from commenting upon this.
Worst Enemy
It seems there is nowhere
to hide. A cinema queue in
the West End might seem a
peaceful enough place to
spend a couple of hours in
the rain; but no ! A young
man with a guitar around his
neck (yes, around his neck
for goodness's sake) will ap-
proach and proceed to strum
and sing. Once you have been
picked for a target there is
little you can do. I even gave
money to one once but he just
went on playing as if 1 was
his worst enemy. I really
don't mind people falling on
hard times but I wish they
would do it in private.
One of the most powerful
means of distributing noise is
the hop. Having once lived in
Old Beit I can write from ex-
perience on hops. My window
was unfortunately placed and
by an architectural fluke the
sound was louder in my room
than in the concert hall.
Ticket buying friends envied
my location but I considered
four hours of incessant pop
music for nothing to be pretty
poor value for money.
However on several occa-
sions I have attended one of
these incredible functions
with the object of seducing
young ladies. I once noticed
a friend of mine standing ap-
parently alone and jigging
about. Noticing my amaze-
ment he explained he was
dancing and indicated his
partner who was standing
about ten feet away. This was
a revelation. I hadn't real-
ised you could claim to be
dancing with someone so far
away but I quickly caught on
to the idea. That night I
danced with some of the pret-
tiest girls in the room and
not one of them felt a thing.
It spoils things when it's too
easy though, doesn't it ?
Find the Lady
I've not limited my esca-
pades in London to hop
going. Many a Saturday
morning has ben spent stroll-
ing in Portobello Road
watching the newly arrived
American tourists taking
photographs of the trendy
people who are really Ameri-
can tourists who have been
here a week, (you don't think
anyone would really dress up
like that, do you?). It is a
fascinating place, though.
They play the mysterious
game called " find the lady ".
They line up three people
and you have to guess which
one is the girl.
Nothing has been spared
in my attempt to join the Lon-
don scene. I started going to
Henry, "looking for myself" :
I suppose a few visits con-
vinced me I had been there
all the time. I even obtained
a computer date convinced
that the electronic brain
would calculate a perfect
match for me. But she never
replied to my letter. I sup-
pose she must have flipped
instead of flopping. Maybe I
was a bit too choosy anyway.
(Women of over twenty stone
who collect Dinky Toys must
be quite rare). Anyway,
wherever you are Gladys, just
send me the 10/- and we'll
forget all about it.
It appears that I'm just not
a trendy person. I haven't
the money for a pink shirt
(nor the body) and no matter
how careless I am I can't
seem to get white paint on
my jeans. And when you're
an untrendy person with sen-
sitive ears then London just
isn't the place for you. How-
ever I've thought of a solu-
tion to both problems:—I
shall grow my hair long for
peace—when it gets over my
ears it will keep out the
noise.
