l Mellor reports on the Reliant Scimitar GTE (pictured right)
So often I read car magazines which describe road tests of exotic machinery, and
never tell you what it's actually like to drive these cars. For the majority of students
including myself, cars faster and more expensive than an MGB are just to be looked at
as they roar off down the road. Yet many of us when we leave I.C. will have the desire
and money to buy one of these cars. Just how different are they?
My own personal machine
is a Morris Minor 1000 Van,
complete with Pirelli Cin-
turatos and plenty of car-
peted floor in the back for
those occasional emergency
situations. Having driven
this for over a year I have
longed for a car that is really
comfortable to travel long
distances in, will go round
sharp corners without the
back end sliding, will cruise
at 70 mph plus without any
fuss, and have a reasonable
amount of room.
It was with this in mind
that I had a test drive of a
Reliant Scimitar GTE which
I picked up from the very
helpful Stuart Mayhew of the
Chequered Flag in Chiswick.
No "Sit Up and Beg"
Apart from its size, over
14 feet long, the first thing
that I noticed was the driv-
ing position. My rear sank
into a very comfortable seat
whilst my legs disappeared
down to the pedals, which

straight, seemed miles away.
Also seemingly miles away
was the steering wheel which
had to be held with straight
arms. This straight legs and
arms attitude is most unfam-
iliar after the sit up and beg
position of most student
machines.
The engine power is the
next thing to get used to.
With a 3 litre V6 engine pro-
ducing about 140 bhp, and a
top speed of just over 115
mph, this compares with my
van which has a 948 cc, 38
bhp straight four and a safe
top sped of 70 mph. The
acceleration was tremen-
dous. Roadholding is excel-
lent and should be with 185
section (i.e. fat) Pirellis all
round. Big disc brakes on the
front make sure that braking
is strong and fade free.
The gear lever was badly
placed and had too long a
travel. Changing into 2nd
or 4th brings your forearm
against the glove box. How-
ever apart from a rather low
second gear, the ratios were
good and the overdrive on
3rd and 4th was also good.
Overdrive on a car like this
is a boon, and at 70 mph in
overdrive top, the rev coun-
ter was reading 2800 rpm.
So at motorway speeds of up
to 100 mph the car is loafing
along.
The V6 engine is the same
engine that goes in Ford
Zodiacs and 3 litre Capris
Being relatively untuned it
returns excellent fuel con-
WARNING
HEALTH HAZARD
The complaint known as Moronicus Leftism, or Mao's
sickness is now recognised as notifiable, on the grounds that
most of the victims are mobile health hazards.
The following notes will
enable the general practi-
tioner to identify and treat
this malady.
The s y m p t o m s : The
patient becomes rapidly
more hirsute, particularly
about the head; he will be-
gin to identify his clothing
as a battered pelt rather than
as an official covering. The
condition often results in the
patient looking more like
primitive ape-man than a
human being.
Coupled with this rapid
physical decay is an equally
rapid mental deterioration,
though the victim is able to
speak (which they do inde-
fatigably) and remains just
capable of operating a dupli-
cating machine. The results
of these efforts make little
sense, as if the victims have
no notion as to the meaning
of the words they use, neither
do they appear to compre-
hend when spoken to, though
there is a curious rapport be-
tween victims (c.f. communi-
cation in lower primates).
The vision of the patient is
short-sighted—this may be
partially cured by use of
second-hand glasses or even
by a pair of lenses supported
on fuse wire.
Causes: Unknown; present
theories include partial evol-
utionary throw-back, or that
the victim is shrouded by a
hairy parasite. The former
theory is supported by the
evidence of unusual fertility
(?) rites held in Grosvenor
Square, while the latter
theory better explains the
victim's appearance.
Treatment: There is no
known form of satisfactory
cure but the disease will often
disappear after a few years.
However, the health hazard
presented by the victims may
be curbed by suitable treat-
ment on a sheep farm, where
the patient may be clipped
and shorn. Apart from this,
one can only wait and hope
that the patient will eventu-
ally regain his mental facul-
ties.

sumption. The peak power is
developed at a low 4500 rpm
and the engine sounded
rather noisy over 5000 rpm.
This encourages change ups
at 5000 or below and this
further helps the fuel con-
sumption. The engine is such
a slogger that at one stage
we took off from the lights
in 3rd without too much
bother.
Behind the driver are two
reasonable seats with ade-
quate leg room. However if
these are folded down, a
mammoth platform is made.
In fact it is 57 inches (145
cms) long and this consumes
vast amounts of luggage or
anything else you want in
the back.
The attractive glass fibre
body comes in a range of
pleasing colours. Having an
estate car type back window
means that dirt collects all
over the glass. The G T E
now comes with a two speed
electric wiper and electric
washers as standard, and
very useful too.
All in all it is a very de-
sirable car and definitely a
good swap for my van.

This decade will see tremendous upheavals in the Third
World and in British Education. Can Imperial College meet
the challenge of either? Can Imperial College take a lead in
producing the broad minded socially aware graduates with
the organisational and critical facilities so necessary for
grasping the relationship between the 3rd World and the
West? Will the major Union policies — Which attempt to
help meet this aim — be met with this term or this decade?
Major Union policies are being answered with "No" or
erosive excuses.
Last November 14 'the Rector set up a Working Party
to investigate the committee (infra) structure of the Board
of Studies. The terms of reference of this Working Party are
too limited, it has not met yet, and is now being used as an
excuse to prevent proper participation in discussion concern-
ing the Architectural Association. We have agreed to co-
operate with this Working Party but there is a possibility
that the Architectural Association will refuse to do so.
In the A.A. negotiations the College has stated 4
reserved areas of no student participation, I think that if the
A.A. community is to mean anything When it comes to I.C.
these reserved areas must be abolished.
The Pro-Reotor's (October 29) diversification co-ordina-
tion committee has not yet met, although some useful collect-
ing of information has been done as part of its programme.
Heads of departments, and the Board of Studies must agree
to the establishment of a dept/office of non-teohniical studies
and before that gets under way they must introduce existing
courses on a college-wide ostensible basis and cut out some
of the unnecessary detail in some of the existing main
courses.
Things are moving very slowly on Senior Common
Room usage and approximately not at all on a say over
the appointment of certain non-academic staff.
In conclusion, a lot will happen this term. Union
decisions are important and need mass support so make sure
your dept. and year reps, keep you informed — and come
to UGM's.
