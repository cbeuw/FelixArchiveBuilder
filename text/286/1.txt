Hall Improvements
Tizard Hall has decided to
expand its galley area, to
allow more residents to
escape from Mooney food,
particularly the dreaded
weekend Southside Mooney.
The new arrangements will
provide 18 cookers for the
120 residents—equivalent to
about one per landing.
While Tizard residents plan
to heat up more of their
food, Linstead residents can
now cool down more of their
perishables. The Hall now
has one refrigerator per land-
ing on all but two landings,
giving one fridge per 7.733
residents (approx.), as op-
posed to one fridge for 24
Southside residents.
Getting away from food,
Falmouth Hall is to improve
its amenities in a defferent
way. A poll of residents has
come down overwhelmingly
in favour of installing a foot-
ball table on the Gallery
level. Football machines are
becoming increasingly popu-
lar around the College—this
fact is not unconnected with
the fact that they can easily
make £10 profit per week.

An interview with a ghost
Looking back over past
issues, FELIX noted the
lack of activity from that
e n i g m a t i c group, The
Wooden Horse Organisation
(WHO to you), the IC mas-
cotry group. Accordingly, we
sent one of our ace reporters
to interview one of the co-
chairmen of WHO. Firstly he
asked about co-chairmen,
why not just one chairman?
Our contact said, "I think
the idea was to remove the
possibility of anyone taking
over WHO for self-aggrand-
izement. So, when we are up
to strength we have 4 co-
chairmen, one from each
constituent college and one
in charge of the alarms for
MIKE (that's me). At the
moment, the R.C.S. co-chair-
man is trying to get a
degree, Guilds failed last
year, and I haven't heard of
Mines for months. Person-
ally, I want to get a degree,
and any time left over I am
forced by evil task-masters
to work for another college
organ, as you know. The
other star members of WHO
are either working hard for
their pass degrees or working
for various college publica-
tions.
"I am worried about next
year, as the people with any
knowledge of WHO are all
3rd years and there will be
nobody left next year to
carry on the good work."
FELIX asked if the re-
maining members of WHO
had lost interest. "Yes, T
think so, as far as acquisition
is concerned I don't think
there is anybody left with
sufficient interest. As for my
speciality, keeping MIKE,
we designed an alarm system
which should be pretty well
foolproof, it would take me
a good hour to think of a way
to abduct MIKE, and I
know the system. Last year,
we had the system 80% fin-
ished, but there is still a lot
of work to be done, and I
am the only one with suffi-
cient knowledge of electron-
nics and the desire to get the
damn thing finished that I

w Physics Exams
Third year Physics under-
graduates are to participate
in an experimental examina-
tion at the end of this term.
The staff-student committee,
after investigating the in-
adequacies of the present
exam system and several
alternative methods, has
suggested setting a Graduate
Record Exam on the lines of
those used by the Princeton-
Berkdley - Evanston Educa-
tional Testing Service. The
questions are designed to test
speed of understanding and
ability to marshal facts and
arguments. It is hoped that
the exam will not just test
the candidates memory and
speed of writing.
Such exams have been
used and well received in
North America for some
years.
The Graduate Record
Exam system consists of a
series of statements about a
particular situation. Each
statement is followed by a
set of 5 possible answers or
deductions, and the candi-
dates must select the best
alternative.
Example: A frictionless ideal
heat engine operates between a
heat reservoir at 227 degrees
centigrade and one at 27
degrees centigrade. The thermo-
dynamic efficiency of this
engine is: (A) 40%, (B) 45%,
(C) 60%, (D) 88%, (E) 100%.
On the three hour paper,
about 100 questions wMl be
set, with no limit to the
number of questions to be
attempted.
In a circular to all third
years students, the staff-stu-
dent committee asks for stu-
dent co-operation in the
experiment in order that
both students and examiners
may objectively judge how
the results of the Graduate
Record Exam system com-
pare with those of traditional
papers.
The committee emphasises
that the exam is experimen-
tal, and will not count in any
way towards final degree
classification.
know of in the college. It
would take me a month, do-
ing nothing else, to get the
system finished."
Just how complicated is
the system, we asked. "Well,
without giving too much
away, I say say that the full
circuit diagram would in-
volve many sheets of fool-
scap. We estimate that, if we
had paid for all the electron-
ics, it would have cost several
hundred pounds, as it is, I
think we have spent about
£30 so far. We started off
designing a system to protect
MIKE and the plinth, then
we sat and thought how the
protective devices could be
disabled and designed protec-
tive systems for them, then
we sat a few more hours and
tried to think how we could
disable the protection of the
protection and protected
that, and so on, until we had
eliminated just about every-
thing but the human element.
By that I mean people who
hear alarms in the night,
swear, turn over, caress their
girl friends, and go back to
sleep. Perhaps we could re-
duce this risk by inventing
a Science Fiction type ray to
bring on mass menstruation,
then, with nothing better to
do, people might come along
to save MIKE."
FELIX asked where
MIKE was at the moment.
"Can I see your union card?
We have tried that method
of getting mascots! In fact.

Change
in
Maths
Professor Jones, Head of
the maths, department told
a meeting of third year stu-
dents that his opinion on the
question of diversification of
studies within his department
was that "we should regard
mathematics as much more
important."
During his four minute
address Professor Jones out-
lined the plans for diversifi-
cation within the maths, de-
partment. There are to be
three courses available.
Moral philosophy, twentieth
century history and drama.
These will carry no exam
credit, will "unfortunately"
clash with lectures and will
not be included in the tutor-
ial system.
Although Professor Jones
certainly never said as much,
there was a feeling among
many of the students that he
thought non-technical stud-
ies a waste of time, and that
with so little encouragement
from the department, such
studies would never get off
the ground.
Social
Southside
Interlude
During the first three days
of the Christmas vacation
the "National Revolutionary
Socialist Student Federation"
held a conference in the old
Union building. FELIX is
unfortunately short of re-
liable reports on what was
discussed. However, some
difficulties arose over their
generous nature. Some of
them who were sleeping in
booked rooms in Southside,
invited their friends in to use
their floors. This apparently
caused some consternation
among the cleaners, house-
keepers and sub-wardens.
At the same time, and un-
remarked, an industrial exhi-
bition was held in the stu-
dents common room in Col-
lege Block.
