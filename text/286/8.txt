USKENSHEET
ARRIVES
M o v i n g i n t o
L i n s t e a d
Bowing to popular demand
a brand new and thoroughly
exciting Uskensheet is being
produced fortnightly for the
edification and entertainment
of students in U.S.K. The
first issue, on Monday, 12th
January contained the
colourful and brilliant U.S.K.
map to ensure that if you get
lost you've got something to
blame it on. Anyway, folks,
there are obvious advantages
in splashing the name of your
society, etc., over South Ken.
so try to let us have as much
gen on whatever happenings,
lectures, films, etc. that you
may be organising. We would
like information on ents and
events as far ahead as pos-
sible but the final day for
copy is the Thursday before
the date of publication. Send
the relevant info, with your
name and phone no. to:
Uskensheet Ents Pigeonhole,
c/o I.C. Union Office.
This service is FREE and
the potential enormous
to all clubs and socs. in the
U.S.K. but if you want
special attention (a full page
technicolour ad. perhaps?)
the production costs are
modest I assure you. Well,
don't just sit there—send us
something.
P.S. We also need useful
people like arty designing
types and imaginative writing
bods.
The H. G. Wells Society
has moved into its new
'office' on Linstead Upper
Gallery. The Society, with
its many sub-groups and
other activities, formerly
worked from various rooms
in Southside, but felt that a
Society of such a size needed
a separate base for its acti-
vities. The application from
Wellsoc to use the room was
approved by Linstead Hall
Committee last term and
will be reviewed annually.
* * * *
Someone else moving into
Linstead Hall is Mr. Frank
Potter, acting Warden in the
absence of Mr. Paul Minton
(who has gone to Australia
for a year).
Mr. Potter, who is Senior
Treasurer of RCC and was
previously resident in Tizard
Hall, brings his family up
from Hampshire to join him
in Linstead Penhouse.

W e l l s o c B a l l s
To make the IC contribu-
tion to European Conserva-
tion Year, Wellsoc's exhibi-
tion this year, held in Mech
Eng Concourse, will be on
the themes Pollution and the
Thames. A lively debate is
expected at a symposium on
"The Thames—Sewer or
Stream", at which represen-
tatives of the Thames Con-
servancy and the Port of
London Authority will
speak.

Wellsoc is also organising
a Tom n' Jerry Soc. At the
Tuesday film shows, other
well-known cartoons will be
screened as well as T n' J.
For further details look out
for publicity or ring the
Wellsoc office, Int 3303. The
first show is on 20th Janu-
ary.
Social
Work
Involving
I.G.
Keith Lindsay, of l.C.'s
Community Action Group
informs FELIX that there
are many areas of social
need in which I.C. students'
help would be invaluable
this term.
There is a Swimming Club
for the Physically Handicap-
ped held every Friday in the
Silchester Road Baths, North
Kensington, between 7 p.m.
and 9 p.m. This club has a
warm spirit of friendship
and requires helpers not only
in undressing, particularly
younger participants.
Another Junior Club For
Educationally Maladjusted
T W O G I R L S

FROM EACH DEPARTMENT

FORTNIGHT
SELLING
FELIX
Don't all rush at once
drop a note to Felix via
The Union Rack or con-
tact a
Member of the Felix Staff.
Colourful Union
The Union duplicating ser-
vice has now the capability
of printing with blue and
orange ink, as well as the
standard black. The colour
facility will replace the old
Felix colour service, which
used red ink, since the Felix
duplicator has now reached
the end of its life.
The colour duplicating ser-
vice is available by special
arrangement only—contact
Jonathan Moont, 415 Tizard,
whom you should also con-
tact for details of the nor-
mal UDS services. Unfor-
tunately, due to high cost of
colour ink, etc, charges for
colour work are higher than
for black.
RAKE
AT
MARIA
ASSUMPTA
The Maria Assumpta col-
lege stands unobtrusively in
one corner of Kensington
Square (behind Barkers). To
be admitted one must knock
at the main door, state one's
business and be escorted to
the common room—all
rather daunting.
But it's worth it for hid-
den in the Mexican style
arched corridors there are
422 beautiful girls.
The girls live in digs and
hostels nearby and join in
I.C. activities, 3-Iegged crawl,
Walk, Touchstone, refect-
ories. Their President's Ball
is one of the smartest, held
at the Royal Gardens Hotel
and they are allowed to hold
a Rag Week with Q.E.C.
(later this term).
So contact either the
President Catherine McDer-
mott or the External Affairs
(!) Officer Veronica Carrol
if you would like your club/
society meetings graced with
a little feminine charm—We
need it!

turning home from work.
The Motorway: A group
in college is studying the pos-
sibilities for use of space un-
der the motorway in Pad-
dington in preparation for
proposing some scheme for
its use. Cooperation with the
Civil Engineering Depart-
ment has already evolved a
scheme and more help is now
needed in contacting the
various organisations who
may be able to utilise the
space.
A Thalidomide Club for
children meets every Satur-
day between 10 a.m. and 11
a.m. in the Church Hall of
St. Pauls, Onslow Square,
S.W.3 Help is required

clude painting, table tennis
and various crafts, and also
in transporting the children
to and from the club on
buses.
Further to these, the Com-
munity Action Group hopes
to involve itself in the Car-
nival Charity—the West-
minster Society for Handi-
capped Children—by assist-
ing in the residential hostel
for children that they are
opening.
For any further details
contact Community Action
via the Union Rack or
phone Keith Lindsay, inter-

M o r e W H O
Continued from Page 1
if I may digress a moment,
we once got a women's train-
ing college to show us their
mascot, pretending to be re-
porters looking at mascots,
but when it came to the point
of grabbing their furry thing
and running, we just didn't
have the heart; they were
such dolly birds.
"As for MIKE, he is in a
safe place, not too far away,
and, if ICU demanded that
MIKE should appear at
Union meetings, we could get
it in with hardly any
trouble."
Our reporter asked if any-
thing could be done to revive
WHO. "Well, we need more
people to take an interest,
and eventually take over. If
anyone is interested, they
should drop a line in the
Union letter rack under 'W'."
Bacchus
The Chairman of the
Bacchic Society today (Sun-
day) denied that his group
existed for the organisation
of orgies. "This is a slander
perpetrated by Henry, who
want a monopoly of these
activities," he said.
