Swedes have problems too
The Students Union of the
Lund Institute of Technology
in Sweden was host to stu-
dents from many European
countries for an International
Study Week at the end of the
last summer vacation. The
aim of this week was to com-
pare methods of technical
education in Europe and to
help Swedish students formu-
late ideas for modernising
their education system.
The courses at the LIT are
arranged so that students
progress from year to year
after passing certain exam-
inations. These examinations
are held after every course of
lectures and repeated 2 or 3
times during the year. Stu-
dents can thus take the
examinations 3 or 4 times
without falling behind, but
there is no compulsion to
take or pass these examina-
tions—in fact only 15% of
the students complete their
studies in 4 years, 37% take
4-5 years and 18% 5-6 years;
85% of students complete
their studies ever (up to 9-10
years!) No student can be
asked to leave his course, but
money from the State be-
comes progressively more
difficult to obtain with length
of time spent on a course.
Why arc the success rates
so low? It is difficult to pin-
point one specific reason. The
entry requirements for a
technical university are very
high, only the medical
schools set higher standards,
so certainly the students are
not dim. The examination
system leads to an attitude of
" well, so what if I fail, I can
always take it again". The
ruthless (by comparison) IC
methods p r o d u c e more
graduates more efficiently
with similar teaching and
laboratory facilities, the only
significant difference is the
lack of a tutorial system in
Sweden (tutorials are like
bowler hats and fish and
chips, typically British).
Too Agreeable
I think that the main
reason is that the student is
living at a very high
standard. All students receive
a grant of £100 P.A. plus a
loan of £700 p.a. repayable
at a low rate of interest over
about 25 years. Student
accommodation is excellent
and puts Britain to shame,
only married students are
permitted to share rooms
(they generally have flats pro-
vided by the university), the
average student pays £4-£5
per week for a bed-sitting
room not unlike our Halls of
Residence. There are enough
rooms for all so the student
can keep his room for as
long as required—most
rooms are in modern blocks
owned and run by student
cooperatives. Most students
cook their own meals
(restaurants tend to be ex-
the same price as in London
the same price as London
one can soon realise how
most students are able to run
cars and buy expensive hi-fi
systems and televisions. Why
should this affect examina-
tions? My answer is that the
Swedish student finds life too
agreeable, he faces no hard-
ships like an early morning
ride on the District Line or a
bad bed-sit in Fulham, he
can study at his own rate of
progress and has no worries
about being rejected by the
university. His only worry is
his money; even this is not
too bad, he is guaranteed
£800 p.a. for 4 years regard-
less of parental income and
can probably arrange a 5th
year as well. So why should
he work hard and spoil the
enjoyment of the best years
of his life? In my opinion it
is an example of lack of fore-
sight, a lack of realising how
much improvement in living
s t a n d a r d s can affect
academic work.
I wish that IC could avoid
a similar mistake, but in view
of the cessation of construc-
tion of new student accom-
modation in South Kensing-
ton of a respectable standard
and the general national
economic situation 1 think it
improbable that we shall be
facing these problems in the
near future.

Magic Theatre
" Soundtrack "
Dandelion 63752
This album title best sums
up the group, for their act
not only consists of the
music, but almost every
aspect of art. Comprising
fourteen m e m b e r s this
branches to give two dancers,
two light show operators, one
narrator and sundry others
as well as musicians.
So just listening to this
album is not adequate to
appreciate the group fully.
The light show in itself re-
flects, by films and slides, the
theme of each number and
the dancers complete the
visual effect.
Principal Edwards have no
worries as they are mostly
Exeter University students
who have taken the year off,
and their happiness, especi-
ally of vocalist Vivienne, is
reflected in their songs.
On record the items per-
formed range from Shakes-
peare's " Third Sonnet to
Sundry Notes of Music " set
to m u s i c in a semi-
Elizabethan/semi-rock atmo-
sphere, through " Pinky, A
Mystery Cycle", a myth-
ological personification of the
moon, to " Enigmatic In-
somniac Machine" a song
by a girl lying awake beside
her sleeping lover.
Unfortunately their single
" Ballad " is not included, as
this was one of the best
singles of 1969, but other
material such as " Sacrifice "
and " The Death of Don
Quixote" is equally enjoy-
able.
Fairport Convention
" Liege & Life " ILPS 9115
Fairport Convention has
undergone several changes in
the group, each time produc-
ing different sounds. But this
latest arrangement (or rather
up to a few weeks ago), with
the addition of Dave Swar-
brick and drummer Dave
Mattacks, seems to produce
the most natural and gentle
sound of all.
Sandy and Dave's previous
experiences in the folk world
seem to have influenced the
choice of material, with no
less than five traditional
English numbers. Every one
is well arranged, and Sandy's
voice is just about perfect for
the backing provided.
Songs written by the group
are " Crazy Man Michael "
and " Farewell, Farewell" by
Richard Thompson, both
being soft ballads, and
" Come All Ye " by Sandy,
which can best be described
as a beckoning call to the
group.
This record is the first of
its kind to successfully re-
store the English folk song to
its rightful place and bridge
the gap between folk and
rock. It provides a most en-
joyable album of the group's
short lived experience in this
field.
Bert Jansch Sampler
Tra Sam 10
Transatlantic have pro-
duced a number of different
samplers over the past few
months. This latest one
seems exceptionally good
value at 15/5 as they seem to
have chosen some of Jansch's
most well known tracks.
"Anji", a Davy Graham
standard, is one on his first
L.P., as is "Needle of
Death", his own personal
song about drug addiction.
" Go Your Way My Love "
and " Wishing Well" are
both written by Ann Briggs,
whom Jansch admires very
much indeed. Two more well
known tracks are " The First
Time Ever I saw Your
Face", a Ewan MacColl
song, and " N o t t a m u n
Town ", a traditional number
from the second Fairport
Convention L.P.
This one fifth of the Pent-
angle virtually has the history
of his success summed up in
this record, and any novice
guitar players listening to it
will realize how much further
there is to go up the ladder
of progress.

Don't fight over it
We know that lots of you want
details of graduate careers with
British Leyland—and really, it's
not surprising1
. We are the only
major British owned motor
manufacturers, Britain's fifth
largest company by sales value, and
its largest exporting company.
Not to mention our outstanding
technical achievements—the
front-wheel drive transverse engine
concept, hydrolastic suspension,
gas turbine development, fixed head
diesel engines, semi-automatic
transmissions on trucks, and
"Prestal", a new alloy.
But such a diverse range of
activities needs more and more
graduates of all disciplines, for
fifteen major functions in six
divisions of the Corporation. You'll
find all the details, in this book—
"Graduate Careers in British
Leyland". Read it, and arrange to see
us when we call at your university.
You can get a copy, and fix
the appointment through your
Appointments Board. Or write for a
