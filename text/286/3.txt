No review of IC '69, no looking back to the decade that's
gone, FELIX faces the new-year slightly changed in staff
and slightly changed in format. Brighter, we hope, but still
covering the serious side of IC.
Remember "No free Beer for the British "? Clive Robin-
son's letter to FELIX condemning George X's views on
Overseas Students was cut by the FELIX editorial staff
because we thought, and still think, that parts of it came
under 'defamation of character" and shouldn't be published.
We feel the edited letter we printed was sufficiently critical,
and stated Clive Robinson's views as he intended, without
sinking too low into mud-slinging. Clive Robinson disagreed.
CEFE promptly printed extracts from another Clive Robin-
son letter which duly made its way here, attacking FELIX
for "butchering" his letter without giving him prior warning.
The letter isn't published here, it was 600 words long and
parts had already been published in CEFE; but I'd like to
stress one point:— regardless of whether Clive's letter was
strictly libellous or not, FELIX is not a combat area for any
two people to hold a slanging match. Many people must
disagree with Justin Johnson's near-extremist views, but if
they cannot criticise without resorting to hurling abuse, we
can't print it.
The first week of the 70s saw the "first formal IC Union
Newsheet" appear to join FELIX, the Constituent College
Newsheets and CEFE in spreading joy to the masses. With
the other duplicated humph sheets coming from the Union
office in a continuous stream, this makes quite a mass of
information produced for the benefit (?) of IC students; if
you're apathetic now you've only yourself to blame. But
if there are plenty of news-media we can't say the same for
the news in the first week of a new term. News-shortage and
money-shortage forces us to cut down to 8 pages again, so
we can't bring you results of the R.S.M. "Kill-A-Commie^
for-Christmas-Competition". The next Felix will be out on
the 29th January with a special feature on the exhibition
currently running at the I.C.A.

LETTERS T O THE EDITOR
S u r f e i t o f U . G . M . s ? M i s l e d b y h e a d l i n e
Dear Sir,
From January 1 this year, the majority of British students
have the right to vote for members of parliament. May I
express the hope that we shall take up our matters of griev-
ance not directly related to students with our elected mem-
bers at Westminster and not waste time at Union meetings.
It would then be possible for Union meetings to be shortened
and reduced in number.
Does anyone seriously consider that a motion passed at
Imperial College, or even by all students in Britain, will
influence Apartheid policies in South Africa or United
States involvement in South East Asia ? Many students
have other things to do at lunchtime on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, and although I am prepared to attend a reason-
able number (2-3) of Union meetings each term, I find it
impossible to attend the number of lengthy meetings held
last term.
Yours faithfully,
Ross Maxwell

Editorial note: The following letter has been received from
one of the several members of the staff asked to write an
article for Felix on the subject of representation.
I do not think any useful purpose would be served by my
commenting in Felix on the recent decision of the Board
of Studies not to allow student representation for a trial
period of one year. Like the majority of my colleagues, I
am now responsible for this decision by default as I was
unable to attend the meeting.
By publishing extracts from the confidential minutes of
the June 12th Board of Studies meeting, it has been very
easy for some people to represent the professors as the John
Birch Society of South Kensington who regard the gener-
ation gap as a ditch to be defended to the last man lest
the country be over-run by
long-haired revolutionaries
("Hey, punk, where are you
going to with those beads
around your neck? ! "). This
is misleading and unhelpful.
There is very general
agreement among the staff
I have talked to that College
Boards and committees deal-
ing mainly with routine busi-
ness are not well suited to
promote the changes neces-
sary from time to time to
maintain Imperial College as
a seat of learning of the
highest quality and ensure
that its activities continue to
be relevant to the society in
which we live.
Following a suggestion put
to the Board of Studies,
machinery is now in motion
to set up an infra-structure
committee (or committees) to
stand between the Board and
departmental c o m m i 11 ees
with representation from
students and staff at all
levels. This is intended to
provide a forum for new
ideas and be a place where
steam can be generated be-
hind the good onesv I be-
lieve this is a positive and
helpful idea and hope that
students will back it. Every
effort should be made to see
that something fruitful comes
out of it which will be of
genuine benefit to the whole
College.
Yours sincerely,
P. T. Matthews
(Professor)
Dear Sir,
1 want to bring to the
notice of your readers the
false and misleading title
used by the Editor of Felix
on Clive Robinson's letter in
Felix (Dec. 4th). I will admit
that the British male students
were not invited to the party
organised by O.S.C. (Overseas
Students Committee—Ed),
and I would like to thank
Clive Robinson on his realis-
ation of hard facts), but to
say that "No Free Beer for
British" (in Felix) is ex-
tremely provocative. As a
matter of fact, beer was sold
cheap.
The many overseas stu-
dents attending a party is an
experience in itself. Any en-
couragement given to an
overseas student, who has in-
herent inferiority complex
and is conscious of his in-
ability to speak English lan-
guage, must be welcome. If
any British student thinks
that all a student coming
fiom overseas needs is a
technical education at home,
then he is no different in his
attitude from those who rep-
resent the generous aid-giving
governments of the Western
countries.
There are several other ex-
periences which an overseas
student lacks; like social get-
to-gethers, open debates, or-
ganisation and administration
of Unions, etc. If an over-
seas student is to obtain
all round education at I.C.
he must be encouraged to
experience various things,
sometimes exclusively.
With 20% of the student
population being from over-
seas, I think we are making
too much fuss about the
party given by O.S.C.
