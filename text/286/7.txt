John and Mary is one of
those films that makes one
want to go rushing for the
door. It's too neat, too in
and everything in it is cal-
culated to appeal. Both the
main characters do all the
right things, cook all the
right foods and each has the
right job. John admirably
played by Dustin Hoffman is
a furniture designer, while
Mary (Mia Farrow) works in
a gallery selling ethnogra-
phica. If there was ever a
film designed to be commer-
cial, then this is it. There is
virtually no plot, but the
action, which is set in New
York contrasting with the
book, which was set in High-
gate, happens on many week-
ends in various halls of resi-
dence in College. It was prob-
ably because I felt I'd seen it
all before in real life, that in
places it started to pall.
The film opens with John
and Mary waking up together
on a Saturday morning. As
John showers, the sound of
rushing water merges into
the sound of a crowded bar,
where John and a friend are
trying to pick up some
women. He finally (via a little
name dropping) alights on
Mary. The story follows
ROYAL P
REPLY
"SOON"
At his meeting last week
with Gerry Fowler, Minister
of State for higher educa-
tion at the DES, President
Corbyn enquired about the
Union's pamphlet and letter
to the Queen which was
passed on to the DES. Mr.
Fowler said that we should
expect a reply soon.
The Minister at the meet-
ing did not foresee at pre-
sent an increase in student
grants this year and in dis-
cussion about the need for
Maths graduates thought
that more scientists with
more maths would help but
was not totally a revolution.

them through that first Satur-
day and shows them gradu-
ally finding out about each
other. It ends, as it be-
gan with them jumping into
bed with each other again.
One amusing technique the
director Peter Yates has used
is to present John and Mary's
thoughts in dialogue. Flash-
backs of course are used
contantly. The performance
of Farrow and Hoffman is
the sole redeeming feature of
the whole thing.
MY NIGHT WITH MAUD
In case you haven't been to
see one of the best films of
last year (My Night With
Maud), then it is still on at
Academy One. Jean Louis
Trintignant and Francoise
Fabian star in a witty sub-
titled comedy, made inciden-
tally in black and white.
There are some amusing
sequences on the lines of the
seduction scene in the Gradu-
ate, when Maud a very at-
tractive divorced woman tries
to test the morals of a pro-
fessed devoted catholic. The
ending is a little predictable
but the presentation is deli-
cate and extremely credible.
Good acting throughout.

Phoenix is out
You may have seen those
mysterious posters appearing
around college recently ask-
ing 'Why Ever Did You Do
It Ethel?' Well if you buy the
latest issue of Phoenix al-
ready on sale at 15 n.p. you'll
find out. The theme of this
issue has been Underground
and according to the usual
unreliable sources not too far
distant from the editor's
chair, there are some superb
articles, stories, illustrations,
etc., including an interview
with Richard Branson, editor
of Student who tells the re-
markable story of drug plant-
ing by the police, and talks
of the problems of running
the advisory centre and his
battle to try and get the law
on the publication of the
word V.D. changed.
PHOENIX has gone into
colour with a great cover and
blue printing in the inside.
This is the most ambitious
magazine ever launched in
the college and shows that
here and in U.S.K. there is
contrary to popular opinion
a large number of creative
people. I thoroughly enjoyed
reading it and highly recom-
mend it for good bawdy bed
time reading.

The winter term does not
provide much competition in
the rowing world, but we
were pleased to win the
junior division at the univer-
sity of London winter eights
regatta. Training, however,
starts almost immediately in
the term, and much time is
spent coaching the beginners
who, this year, are of high
quality. This term leads up to
the long distance Head-of-
the-River races and the first
squad is already hard at
work. We boat three times a
week and work in the gym
twice a week at weight and
circuit training.
Beginners, however, can
afford to go at a more lei-
surely pace. If you are 6ft.
2ins. tall and around thirteen
stone in weight you have the
ideal build for an oarsman.
If you would like to try the
sport we'd like to hear from
you.
Contact Vic Spencer in
Selkirk 682 or turn up at the
boat house any Saturday
morning.
S.T.O.I.C.
This group was formed
about a year ago from people
who were interested in any
way with television, from
manning television cameras
to becoming a producer,
from sound engineers to the
actors who were in the play
which was video recorded
last year.
The club has at its dis-
posal the use of the equip-
ment of the studio of the
Electrical Engineering De-
partment. At the moment
there are a few things in
mind, for instance the pro-
duction of regular news fea-
tures, television plays staged
by the dramatic society, and
the video recording of
general lecture talks.

terested in STOIC please con-
tact: Sec. Ted Mylton, Chem.
