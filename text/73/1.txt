As a result of the b u i l d i n g operations
on the Union Building, the entire centre of the
Union i s to be transferred to theUnwin B u i l d i n g
i n the Easter Vac. During the Vac. the
builders w i l l move into the Refectory and Upper
Dining H a l l . At the same time the old Upper
and Lower Entrances and the Bar w i l l be closed.
Thus, at one blow we w i l l have l o s t the one
remarking central r a l l y i n g point common to a l l
I.C.
The new i n s t a l l a t i o n s i n the Union
Building w i l l last u n t i l the re-oonstruotion
i s finished, which w i l l probably be at least
eighteen months.
Our drawing shows the new arrangement of
the ground f l o o r of the Unwin Building, with
access from Imperial Institute Rd. The
E l e c t r i c a l Eng. Dept. has vacated the two large
rooms at the West End, which w i l l now be used as
a Lounge and Bar respectively.
Dan, Dioic and Andy w i l l be i n f u l l residence
;
over there, and since the large room above i s
f u l l y available f o r evening functions, the Union
should make i t s e l f very comfortable i n the Unwin
Building.
In Prince Consort Rd., much extra space
should become available i n the Beit Building very
shortly, and we w i l l publish information about
t h i s as i t becomes Known.
