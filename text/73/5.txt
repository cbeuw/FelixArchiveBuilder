The I.C. Jazz club hop was the f i r s t hop
of i t s kind at I.C. The informal jazz groups
at carnivals have become more popular over the
last two years as have the jazz numbers played
by the bands at I.C. hops. Having an a l l jazz
hop nowever was an entirely different thing but
the numbers of people who attended must have
dispelled any doubts the jazz club committee may
have had about the success of the evening.
The fact that the main band, the Birming-
ham University Rhythm, Club were not a t r a d i t i o n a l
jazz group may or may not have been a good thing
for the f i r s t hop of this kind. I t did give
the people who did not want to j i v e some dancing,
but unfortunately people j i v i n g and people do-
ing the foxtrot or quickstepad.0 not get on well
together on the same f l o o r .
The guest band which played down i n the
bar provided a r e l i e f f o r this situation. They
always played very good t r a d i t i o n a l jazz and were
in my opinion the better band. We may well see
more of them at I.C.
Altogether the dance was about the brightest
danoe at Qa :,r
et. Too much so I think, lis f a r
aii Miss Pry was concerned, but the Qa bar seeded
to do a good trade.

been put Into this project by our own and the
University authorities. The room w i l l be

This should take considerable burden off
the over-c"rpwding i n our other Refectories, and
