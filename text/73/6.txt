FELIX
S P O R T S E D I T O R I A L
I t must be glaringly obvious to the minority of
Imperial College students who take an active inter-
est i n some sport that there has been a decline of
athletic prowess within the college. Gone are the
days when Felix was publishing with regularity the
l i s t of U.L. cups won by I.C. clubs. So fair this
season we have yet to record a single cup and the
future i s not particularly overflowing with an abun-
-dance of cups ready to d r i f t through the portale
of I.C.
Let us examine a few details of our inglorious
record. The college was struok a heavy blow between
the eyes when the Rugby club was beaten i n the 1st.
round of the U.L. competition by U.C. The cup, which
has been i n our possession for three years w i l l find
i t hard l i v i n g i n i t s new surroundings, and we hope
that next year i t w i l l be returned to i t s permanent
residence. The Hookey Club, whitfh at one time had
a monopoly of the U.L.cup, have also fallen viotims
to U.C.
The U.L. cross country championships were another
opportunity for U.C. to give a demonstration of their
superiority i n this sport. I.C. can boast seoond hon-
-ours i n the U.L. championships, but this f a l l s short
of previous years when wo were regular holders of the
cup.
We are sure I.C. supporters were disappointed when
the Soccer club were beaten by the odd goal i n the
semi-final by Goldsmiths'. This was our last ohanoe
of holding one of the winter oups. The Squash olub
have reached the semi-final of the U.L. competition,
but they have strong opponents In St. Mary's, tha
other semi-finalists.
The Boxing club, making a welcome return, put up
a gallant effort i n the U.L. championships but were
never expected to emerge as winners. With tha contin-
ued support that they are getting, they could win
these championships neat year.
And ro on to our remaining chances. Tha Sailing
olub cup seems to have oome to I.C. to stay, a stay
l i k e l y to- continue. The Boat Olub a t l l l remains one
of I.C. 'is strongest potentialities In sport, oooea-
-lonally r i s i n g to the heights of national fans.
Let i t be said now that every honour oomlng tha way
of the Boat Club has been won by 'ahear' hard work,
enthusiasm, and the ntriot training programme Itn-
-posod upon them by the arduous natura of their
sport. FJOiII wlshaei them a l l tha bait i n tha near
future Head of the hiver.
However, the faots are l a i d before ua, and wa must
take our hate off to U.C, as the top college of
sport i n the University today. Suooeaa l a only a
limited quantity and bsoauce of this wa cannot ba
too harsh on our own sportsman who, having passed
through a region or dominance ovar tha other aollagea
have now to ba content with watching the luooaai of
others. In a university with a regular throughput
of students, tha fluctuations of university aport
ara wide and oan ohange rapidly from yaar to year)
and what one university gains another lotas. Ovar tha
post war years I.C. have had many good sportsman and
i f the outflow of tha past two years has bean graat-
-er than the Inflow, than we must fight harder to
replace the lost onea by mora training and a rearuit-
-ment of those we fear are hiding their lights behind
a brown bushel. I f ready made athletes are not belag
supplied to our sports clubs then tjlMY.n u
* t oreate
some. Moreover, s k i l l doss not count for a l l that
goes into a victory, let"? have plenty mora s p i r i t .
T A B L E T E N N I S
The 1st team have reached the f i n a l of tha
Caribbean Cup competition, and must now meat
Woolwich I , who are strong favourites for tha
cup. In the semi-final, I.C. beat King's I
8 - 1 which was auprlsingly one-sided i n view
of the result of the league matoh earlier this
season when Kings wen 6 - 4 . For I.C., games
were won by Shoalb (3),Wilson (3),Amatya (2).
Speolal mention must be made af K.aUteaib, a
Pakistan international, who pulled off a mag-
nificent aohi«v*uenr
_ by winning tha B r i t i s h
Universities championship. Ha i a believed ta o

the f i r s t I.C. player aver to t i n tola event.

The f i r s t f i f t e e n has played extremely well
reoently. Their baoks showed magnifioent form
against London Springboks and the matoh was won
14-0. Palmer, B e l l and pontin scored f i v e t r i e s .
A satisfactory revenge was gained over U.C.
who wore defeated 3--0. A fine 40-yard penalty
by Lewis decided the match.
Probably t h e i r best performance of the season
came last Saturday, when before a large crowd
at Richmond Athletic Ground they held Richmond
Vikings to a score of 8-i. But f o r Injuries and
the claims of U.L., I.C. might well have brought
off a surprise win. This i s the sort of per-
formance whioh does muoh f o r the olub'a reputation.
The "a", being depleted by players' injuries and
promotions to the seoond XV, lost to Port of London
Authority, after a valiant..but inexperienced game.
Last Saturday they lost 9-0 to Old Haberdashers in a
very evenly matched game, enjoyed by a l l .
The 2nd XV sustained a defeat from Bank of
England. Dan's team hats shown a complete con-
trast i n the last two weeks. F i r s t , a oomplete
shambles with a mass of reserves and old orooke
(inoluding one who did not turn up u n t i l half-
time) , they l o s t 5-3 to P.L.A. Then, despite
the Carnival, they ran up a uoore of 39 againat
Slough, i n b r i l l i a n t fashion.
The B IX van 12 - 0 by brute force and ignorance*
S O C C E R
Following tha defeat In the aemi-flnal of the
oup the Int. team suffered another setback In
their bid for tha league ohaaplonahip suffering
their f i r s t league dafaat of tha season, losing
to L.8.E. 2-3.
On Saturday on a vary poor plteh tha l a t , XI
drew with Blrkbaok 4 - 4 , the forwards h i t everything
except the goals and had they bean more accurate
an easy victory would have been obtained.

Stephenson Uuui,
QuiIda beat HQS 4-0.
The f i r s t matoh i n tha inter-oollege
hpokay competition on Feb. 9th resulted i n a
win f o r Guilds.
The Guilds' team t r i e d attaoking from the
start but did not get very far u n t i l some hard
work by t h e i r oentre-half and inside forwards
had the H.C.S. baoks out of position. The
3.0,9, forwards had as muoh play as their op-
ponents but never looked r e a l l y dangerous, even
when the Guilds goalkeeper allowed the b a l l to
rebound from one of hie goalposts.
The eeoond h a l f started with the soore at
2-0 i n the Guildsmen's favour. soon after, a
ucirum i n the H.O.S. oirole resulted i n another
red goal, but i t was only after the b a l l had
t r a v e l l e d the length of the f i e l d many,times
that Owen with a f i r s t time shot from a short-
oorner took the aoora to 4-0. so ended an
enjoyable game whioh allowed Guilds to average
their defeat of last year.
