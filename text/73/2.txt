The Chairman of the Social Clubs Committee i s a
complex character.
Tony Werner received his early fighting training
at a prep school containing two fighting head-
masters, one of whom was later awarded £9,000
damages against the other. Tony, being head boy of
one half of the school, which half not specified,
was well to the fore i n the battle. Prom there he
went to Bradfield where after some study he took
Higher 3chool Oert i n Modern Languages and History.
His chief claims to d i s t i n c t i o n at school were an
appearance on T. V. as a slave, the founding a
Conservative Society and the somewhat eccentric
pastime of tree-felling.
From Bradfield Tony went to the Borbonne and
studied there i n the Faculty of Science f o r nine
months. The class consisted of 200 men and 200
young ladies, an opportunity for experience of
which he was not slow to avail himself. Again
he founded a Conservative Society and having .
narrowly escaped arrest he was hailed to the Surete
to account for subversive p o l i t i c a l a c t i v i t i e s . After
a short time he returned to England, though he was
not actually deported.
He then studied elementary science and obtained a
School Certificate i n '-'hemistry at the third attempt.
For part time employment he worked as storeman f o r
a firm of strategic metal dealers and was offered a
job back-stage at a Hammersmith music hall.i'he
nature of his duties i n this post have never been
explained.
Tony came .to I.C. i n October '52 and took part
in the last intermediate course i n the college.
During that year he became Barman & President of
Connaught Hall. In '53-'54 he was President of the
P o l i t i c a l Society and then this session he became
Chairman of the Social Clubs Committee. Once again
he founded a Conservative Society and now serves as
i t s Treasurer. He has f o r the past two years been
a member of the executive of L.D.C.A., and i s also
Editor of the R.S.M. Journal.
It ,ias been noted that Tony i s of a complex nat-
ure. His tastes, are rather more catholic than the
average students. ^'hl8
serves both himself and us
f u l l well i n his administration of the Social Clubs.
Being half Scandanavian and half I r i s h Tony has
an lnborne love of travel, he has ranged over most
of Europe and v i s i t e d Hong Kong, Siam and Greenland.
When not otherwise engaged he resides i n Nice. He
speaks French, Scandanavian languages and English
occasionally. When i n London he lives i n a f l a t
that defies description, l i t t l e of i t being v i s i b l e
due to the mass of books, papers, crockery, sundry
equipment and bottles that covers everything.
Tony has interesting tastes i n wine, women and
song. As f o r the f i r s t he i s a confirmed imbiber
of cognac, i n the direction of the second his activ-
i t i e s must be subversive since there i s l i t t l e to
be seen of them around oollege. He i s reputed to
have a tendency towards brunettes with blue eyes,
though at present i s showing a passing fancy f o r
blondes. As f o r song, his taste i s Slav music. Ho
also collects stamps and traction engines. His
principal d i s l i k e i s having to arrive i n time for
9.30 lectures, a foible he shares with other Mlslag
Geologists.

f i t s (costing under £5 each), together with
colour slides.

There are four very good reasons for buying
this term's "Phoenix". They are four photogra-
phic reproductions i n the centre, showing past
and future aspects of Prince Consort Road and i t s
v i c i n i t y . These four are f a r more eloquent and
interesting than the accompanying a r t i c l e , and
l i k e l y to beoo.ue classics later on.
But "Phoenix" i s a l i t e r a r y publication, and
on that count i t f a i l s miserably this time. There
are seven a r t i c l e s which one presumes represent
the best l i t e r a r y talent i n I.C. today, and not
more than two of them are worth a critic's: praise.
Peter Howe talks fondly, and i n that characteristic
oasual tone of h i s , about treins on the Continent,
and manages to be interesting without being effu-
sive. Vers Atkinson relates two amusing episodes
about The Rozzers, but i s plainly under a strain
to link up the t.vo somehow. The only poem,
"December", has obviously been written i n that month,
and of course has no rhyme or form.
Three articles have been written oy obvious
enthusiasts. Tne one on gliding was tile only one
to arouse any real interest i n me, altnough I have
seen a glider only once in my l i f e . One uoout
rowing in a summer race tries vainly to .j&ite i t
sound heroic, and could only arouse a faint bore-
dom. The two authors use pseudonyms. The third
a r t i c l e i s i n i t i a l l e d , and i s a plain, alueit j e l l -
written account of a Deep oea Cruise.
'The Daily Round1
by "One of tne uragons"
and 'You, Too, Can '}e A W i l l i n g Customer' by
ii.C.Kale are both ligntnearted i n a laboured
sort of way. The l a t t e r further suffers from
i n d i f f e r e n t proofreading.
"A Mining Juggernaut" by Ivingdon i s a
forthright account of the mines' traction engine's
history and prospects. I could not, however,
agree with some philosopny about mascots which he
has put forward i n the opening paragraph. Tne
other reviews, taking ten out of the forty pages,
are uniformly d u l l . There i s a sincere tribute
to the memory of S i r Roderic H i l l , with a good
photograph.
The photographs are tne main value i n this
issue. The rest i s just garnishing. fl „

Two weeks ago, the Engineering Society of City
and Guilds College held i t s Annual Dinner. There was
a new idea i n the a l r - a daring Idea, to judge by the
widespread dissentlon- and i t was to make the Dinner
formal."A monkey-Jacketted a f f a i r . . ? . . . . What snobb-
ery*... How ridiculous.... Impossible, of course..,.
.... etc,...etc...,", said the c r i t i c a l , amongst them
the author. But, however c r i t i c a l he was, he went,
beoause he has enjoyed every other Guild's society
Dinner.
"They'll s i t on their chairs with cellophane
protecting those precious Dinner Jackets, In fact,
the whole evening w i l l be the most depressing one
they've ever sst through", was a much-voiced opinion*
The formal informality; the very warmth and
eetitrlvlallty surpassed the wildest hopes of the
Organisers. With the sedate atmosphere of the Upper
Dining H a l l , with the old ale flowing, with the excel!
ent fare- who could f a i l to suecomb to such ben vivanti
Thankyou, Eng. Soo,, f o r a most enjoyable Dinner.
And saw I ' l l give you a toast.
May a l l those c r i t i c s who forcast failure repent.
May ethers fellow i n your footsteps- to raise the
•iaoeserd of the many functions i n this College even
higher.
