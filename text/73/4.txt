Dear S i r ,
What has happened to Cassandra? Her
continuing silence ever since Christmas
prompts me to suspect what i s commonly known
as 'the worst'. I t must indeed have been
some great influence to e f f e c t i v e l y silence
such a woman: a strong, repeat very strong,
man perhaps (Miner of course).
A possible alternative fate that may have
befallen her f i l l s me with dread. Have R.C.S.
actually f i t t e d the delicate metallic 'foundation
garment'designed by your e d i t o r i a l s t a f f just
before Christmas? I f so, then serious trouble
has probably oocurred already, f o r these things,
l i k e H and A l i n e s , require expert knowledge
for success. Allow me, as a metallurgist, to
point out one or two of the factors that should
always be considered when drawing-up s p e c i f i -
cations for metallio underwear.
(I) Temperature of person encased i n garment:
i f cold, then trouble may follow from oryst;.lline
embriitlement of the t i n p l a t e ; i f hot (as l i k e l y
i n t n i s case) then oare should be taken to avoid
hot shortness.
( 2) Auto frettage.
(3) Creep. (The Brlooaon oupying test i s
of value here)
(4) Whether person conoerned eats i n I.e.
Union rofeotory. I f this Is the oase, great
d i f f i c u l t i e s maj follow consumption of Mr.
Mooney's steamed puddings. (This faotor was
f i r s t considered by Balzao i n ,:iia paper 'The
merry t a t t l e of the nuns of P o i s s y 1
) .
What a dreadful fate t h i s l a s t would be.
please re-assure ma that Casaandra Is s t i l l alive
and well and that she has not been the Innocent,
v i r g i n a l vlatim of R.C.S. inexperienoe with
r e s t r i c t i v e oorsetry.

The Editor,
FELIX.
Dear S i r ,
We have i n front of u* a very amusing
magazine whioh. goes by the name of "FELIX".
We also had at one time, hanging outside ou*
shop, another "Felix" which took the form of
a sign bot.rd! but this "Felix" apparently
decided to walk l i k e i t s namesake.
The contents of your nfiCBpaper' Inform
us that the signboard "walked" to your College
- perhaps i t got rather t i r e d of looking at a
window f u l l of books, and decided to look at
a classroom f a l l of students instead. How-
ever, as our precious oat oost us the precious
sum of £12.12.0. we suggest that it"walk" baok,
or a cheque i n l i e u i s forwarded to us.
In closing, we nave pleasure i n attaching
a post-card reproduction of the brother of our
"Felix" and we sincerely trust i t w i l l lessen
the blow of having to part with our signboard.
Yours very f a i t h f u l l y
FOR PULTENEY. & COMPANY.
Dear Pulteney and Co.,
A fortnight ago we recieved a
aommunloation from F e l i x ' s cousin i n Potton Road,

indeed, sinoe he s e l l s the most d e l i c i o u s oat-food,
so we suggest that you write to him, and obtain a
supply of h i s v i s i t i n g oards, with which, you oan
adorn your window to your hearfs delight.
Yours very sinoerely.^

Dear S i r ,
I would l i k e to make an appeal aoout the
Snack Bar. The queue there moves very slow!/,
so slowly i n fact, that i t i s possible to eat a
sandwich i n the period between picking i t up and
paying f o r i t . This presents a gooa ananas, to
poor, but hungry ones to stoo<c up at no expense
to themselves. Let that be; the delay ouusad
by queueing i a becoming a great nulsanae, I•
could be reduced i f customers would nave their
money ready when oomln& to the aaan-destt. Surely
j . t _ l s not too d i f f i c u l t f o r one to, oalqul-.te, at
least approximately! the oost of whatever ana has
bought so as to be ajle to give money of the.
right order of magnitude to the cashier?
Whatever the arguments i n favour of the p r M -
tioe may be, the habit of buying a drink; only
and then jumping the queue to pay i s objec-
tionable, such customers take almost aa nuqii
time at the desk as does the normal one, and
i t i a t h i s faster, more than any other thfet
slows the queue.
Yours sincerely,
Michael p. M s e r .
