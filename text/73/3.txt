It has given us considerable pleasure to see
the favourable manner i n which the national press
has received the N.U.S. report on undergraduate
grants.
These grants were l a s t reviewed i n 1951i
and with the appreciable r i s e i n cost of l i v i n g
sinoe then there i s a d e f i n i t e case f o r an increase
i n maintenance grants at the present time. N.U.S.
say the r i s e i n essential expenditure f o r students
resident i n London has been 14$ sinoe 1951, we
would say i t was nearer 20$.
We a l l know per-
sonally of genuine oases of d i s t r e s s caused by
economic d i f f i c u l t i e s ; i n many instances the only
action a student oan take i s to d e l i b e r a t e l y low-
er h i s standard of l i v i n g , when a l l that i s needed
i s an extra £ 30 per annum. At the same time
the M i n i s t r y of Education could place the County
awards on a more l e v e l basis.
As students we
are already a p r i v i l i g e d branoh of the community,
but here there i s a genuine grievance, which could
be supported at the highest l e v e l .
Everybody w i l l agree that the two b u i l d i n g
alterations we describe i n t h i s issue are excell-
ent ideas.. The extra refectory space i s ur-
gently needed, and the new centre f o r the Union
w i l l provide us with something that has been
lacking a l l year. The Unwin B u i l d i n g i s cen-
t r a l to a l l three Colleges, and should make us
a fine temporary home.

Alice and her colourful friends presided over the
R.C.B. Carnival last Friday. The theme, being based on
a literary masterpiece, Is a new and very practical
Idea, a welcome change away from the proverbial cowboys
and Indians.
The standard of scenery was extremely high and i t
Is pleasing to note that there was an absence of wanton
destruction during the evening. - Excluding of course
the bricks and snowballs which were flying across the
tennis court between 2 and 5 a.m.!
The scenes portrayed by the K.U.o's artists are tar
too numerous to mentian but here is an outline:
in The queen's Palace (the ijnacK Bar j we saw the
Hatter's Tea party, the i l l t h y Toves, the Lobster and
the liryphon, the nalrus and his pal the Carpenter and
various representations og the tueen of Hearts and her
playing card courtiers. Last, but not by a long way
least, was the Oyster Bed - slice's answer to the Cave-
man's cave.
The centre of attraction In the Panelled Hall was
the fluorescent Cheshire Cat which, thanks to Science
NOT HOhLICKb and Ultra violet light, beamed on the revellers
from 9 until 7.
The 'playing Card' idea was exploited to the f u l l
in the fancy dress parade. Especially woFtthy of mention
were the black Bishop and his attractive partner whose dress
consisted BOLiiLY of the pa^es from 2j editions of AllceJ
iilso John Conway-Jones and his complete suit of cards.
.tbout 90 couples plus the 'Boys' enjoyed this Carrolllne
Carnival, Here's to the next one in ten months time!!

Where would you go for half-session ?
- I.C.W.A. goes West 1
Our President was extracted from the
bar l a s t Friday night to take a long
distance c a l l from Penzance - two young
lady mathematicians wished to claim the
London-Fenzance hitch-hiking record -
- fifteen hours (wearing trousers).

P The passage way through Imperial Institute . to
R.C.S. has now been closed owing to'heating arranjg-
-ments'. However, a passageway on a higher level
exists round the side of the Geat Hall. Instead of
turning right into the'tunnel', one now goes on
another 50 yards, up the steps, along the passage
and down and out through the same door used i n the
other route.
£ Coffee has gone up to 5d. Tea has gone up to 4d.
Provided that the brewers do not raise their prices,
a safe assumption for the time being, beer w i l l soon
be cheaper. Perhaps O.ueenie'8 w i l l soon be known
Moonie's too. Mrs. Bowling (Queenie) w i l l leave
Ayrton Hall Refectory after Easter to run the new
staff refectory i n Queens Gate. Mr. Mooney. w i l l
then take over a l l responsibility for College
Refectories.
£, FELIX i s becoming much maligned by the other
London University press. SENNET stated last issue
that N.E.C. pinched Felix from I.C. instead of
Phoenix. Q.U.C. has printed our Guide/to the
Galleries without acknowledgement. BEDFORD NEWS
and SENNET both used this - but with acknowledge-
-ment.
We hear that the brighter lights of the Chemical
Engineering Department have been conducting some
research into the horse power of the Imperial C o l l -
-ege student. The time taken for selected specimens
to mount the known height of stairs from bottom to
top of the department i s measured with a stop watch,
the weight of the participant i s noted, and the
results converted into ft-lb/sec and so into horse-
power, iRedoubtable' Rugger types have clocked over
one and a quarter H.P.
£ There i s much pleasure i n noting that two guineas
was paid i n "conscience money" to the Guilds Enter-
tainments committee by someone who had gatecrashed
their Carnival and repented.
££ During the day, on Tuesday the 8th, a PERAMBULATOR
was observed by the door of the Zoology Department
adjoining that part of the Hostel where I.e.*.A. l i v e .
Congratulations to the happy mother and may her
County Education Committee be confounded.
S P O R T : - I.C.W.S.C
Only one hockey natch has been played since Christ-
-mas, against Q.K.C. i n rather damp conditions. The
result was 5 - u to the opponents.
Rather more netball has occurred, but with only
ena win, against Battersea Polytechnic 16 - 11.
the squash team, although 1suing to L.S.E., B r i s t -
-ol University, and St.Mary's Hospital, beat fest-
- f i e l d convincingly. A thunderstorm was, however,
necessary to put the opposition off.
The boat club have entered for a regatta i n May,
but optimism has been damped by the resignation of
their coach.
Of ICDSC, Maureen Hawes, Margaret Brown and Janet
Pstoreon, play netball, squash, and swim for the
University respectively.
