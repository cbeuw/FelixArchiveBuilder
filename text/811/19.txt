Much Ado About Nothing Masquerade
The Renaissance Theatre Company at the Phoenix Theatre, Charing Cannon Haymarket.
Cross Road. Directed by Judi Dench.
Much Ado About Nothing is not one
of those Shakespearian plays which
is full of memorable quotes, nor is
it one that gives any great insight
into the Bard's life. It is (or is played
here as) a grand farce with more
than a hint of black humour and a
generous helping of tragedy.
This production, by the
Renaissance Theatre Company, also
marks the directorial debut of the
actress Judi Dench who has decided
to move the play forward in time but
we are left in doubt as to exactly
which century. The plot, like any
good farce, could be described as
convoluted.
Beatrice (Samantha Bond, recently
seen as Rumpole's over eager
assistant Liz Probert) and Benedict
(Kenneth Branagh, of Fortunes of War
fame) are engaged in a merry yet
vitriolic battle of the sexes. The two
have had nothing good to say about
each other for many a year but have
never actually met. This all changes
when the army of Don Pedro, the
Prince of Arragon, and his bastard
brother Don John, returning
victorious from battle, stops at the
home of Leonato, the Governor of
Padua. Benedict is a soldier in the
Prince's Army and Leonato is
Beatrice's guardian.
Soldiers who have been away for
so long think of only one thing and
the moment they arrive at Padua
they set out to get it. Claudio,
Benedict's greatest friend, falls for
Leonato's daughter Hero and
arranges to marry her while
Benedict, a confirmed bachelor,
mocks.
However, a conspiracy is afoot:
Leonato, Claudio, Don Pedro and
Hero feel that Beatrice and Benedict
would make a lovely couple and
attempt by foul means or fouler to
persuade each that the other secretly
loves them.
Got the picture so far?
This is where it gets complicated.
Don John is not only a bastard but
a bit of a so-and-so as well and as
all good villains should, he sets out
to make sombody's life miserable.
His targets are Hero and Claudio
and with the help of a couple of
minor crooks of varying degrees of
incompetence, he sets out to break
up their happy engagement!
Add to this, a household of
eccentric servants and a police force
which would not be out of place in
the Keystone Cops led by a tongue
tied commander and you have all
the elements of a great farce with the
possible exception of a job lot of
dirty books and a visiting
mother-in-law.
Kenneth Branagh's Benedict is
played with tongue in cheek and
ego on show, a definite pig of,the
male chauvenist variety. While
Samantha Bond's Beatrice is a truly
independent woman with more
than a passing resemblance to the
director Judi Dench. Their marriage
would certainly be explosive.
Tam Hoskins as Hero, one of the
few non-comic parts, seems under
used and only really gets her chance
in scenes when Hero has histrionics.
Richard Easton's Leonato is in a
permanent state of admirable
confusion, Shaun Prendergast plays
the villainous Don John as an
oversized Napoleon and Jay Villiers
is entertaining as Borachio, one of
Don John's drunken, incompetent
henchmen. But special mention
must go to David Lloyd Meredith as
the police commander Dogberry
who has a mispronounce and
misphrase Shakespearian English,
which can be difficult to follow at
the best of times, and yet still
succeeds in keeping the audience in
stitches.
It is not without faults; it can be
confusing, is a little overlong and
more help with the story would not
have gone amiss, I had to look most
of it up later. While some of the
actors seemed to be shoehorned into
parts that are just too small for
them, notably those of Hero's and
Beatrice's attendants. This is
partially the fault of the
'Renaissance Theatre Company'
itself: Much Ado is being played
alongside Geraldine McEwan's
version of As You Like It and Derek
Jacobi's Hamlet with the same cast
and hopefully the supporting actors
given meatier parts.
So, if you want an entertaining
night out, I would advise that you
give both When Did You Last See Your
Trousers and Run For Your Wife a
miss and try and get yourself tickets
for Much Ado About Nothing (playing
until October 29).

Masquerade is billed as a 'film noir of
!
the 80s' combining 'love and deceit
blending their elusive attractions to
become a catalyst for murder with
passion and suspense', this is
,suspiciously like the drivel written
I on the back of blockbusters by Jackie
i Collins and Shirley Conran and it
aptly describes the sort of film
Masquerade is, with one exception,
ithe plot in Ms Collins' books is at
least plausible and simple enough
to hold together the story between
the naughty bits. In Masquerade the
plot is so convoluted that it totally
falls apart and there are only two
smutty bits to hold one's attention.
Masquerade is about a poor little
stinking rich girl in the opulent
Hamptons, New York where all the
houses cost at least ten million
dollars. Olivia is wanted for her
money by Tim, wanted dead for her
money by Tony, her wicked
stepfather, and just wanted dead by
JMike for reasons not entirely
Iobvious. And so the scene is set for
imurder and passing amongst the
American gentry and their lavish
lifestyle.
None of the characters elecits
much sympathy from the viewer.
Tony deserves some simply because
he is so consistently nasty and it is
thus apparent that his role is to be
short lived. The director says that it
jis 'essential that the leading
Icharacters are different at the end of
the story than they were at the
beginning'. As four of the six stars
and a rat are dead by the
culmination it can be assumed that
ihe achieves his aim, albeit rather
radically.
Masquerade is well acted, well
made, but abysmally written and is
not really good enough to merit
ispending grant money on.
