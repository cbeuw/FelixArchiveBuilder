College blocks STA deal
The College's assistant finance
officer, Malcolm Aldridge, has
blocked a new Union deal with STA
travel to expand and refurbish their
present outlet. After seeing the
contract for the n e w deal o n
Tuesday 21 September, M r Aldridge
stopped work on the site on Friday
of the same week.
Mr Aldridge told FELIX that he
had stopped the work because he
disagreed with the terms of the
contract and was unable to contact
Union Manager, Dave Peacock
before work started. M r Aldridge
wrote to the manager of S T A travel
when he received the contract on
September 21, explaining that he
was unhappy with it, but did not
inform the Union. A s the person
responsible for signing the contract
on behalf of the College, M r
Aldridge felt the contract 'didn't
seem evenly balanced '. M r
Aldridge claims that he was unable
to contact M r Peacock by telephone,
before stopping the work. M r
Peacock has been busy organising
the refurbishment of the Union
building for several weeks, but
carries a portable telephone at all
times.
Mr Baker and M r Peacock have
refused to comment upon the
incident until further talks have
been carried out with S T A travel.
The deal, however, has suprised
other members of the executive
since no mention of the contract was
made at the last Executive meeting
in the Summer.
The contract gave a percentage of
the profits of the n e w S T A
development to the Union, with the
cost of refurbishment and expansion
to be met by S T A travel. M r
Aldridge was unhappy with the
compensation clause within the
contract which required the College
to pay compensation to the travel
agency if they were forced to leave
their newly developed sites within
five years.
Mr Aldridge told FELIX that the
deal has forced the College and the
Union to 'think through' their
relationship concerning rooms i n
College. H e went on to say that the
incident should lead to a 'better
allbeit more formal arrangement'
between the College and the Union.
The last conflict between the
College and the Union over room
usage occured in 1987. Christine
Taig, Union President at the time,
disagreed with the College's use of
the Junior Common Room (JCR) in
the Sherfield Building as a seating
area for the College's QT snack bar.
The College agreed to pay the Union
compensation for the room's use for
conferences after a student boycott
of the snack bar.
Bernard Sunley House in Evelyn
Gardens is being upgraded at a total
cost of Â£530,000 to bring it in line
with local authority requirements.
The house is made u p of five
original site, 40 to 44. Houses 40 to
42 are to gain two extra kitchens,
three extra toilets and a new shower
in time for the beginning of this
term.
The current wardens' flat is to be
expanded a n d entrances made
along all levels between the houses
to provide two means of escape in
the event of a fire. In addition, the
rooms will be fitted with a new fan
heating system and individual sink
units. The conversion will mean the
loss of three student rooms to allow
the house to meet local authority
requirements on kitchen facilities
and toilets.
M a n a g i n g S u r v e y o r of
Residences, Peter Hallworth told
FELIX, however, that there would
still be an overall increase in student
places in Evelyn Gardens after the
merger of Holbein and Mining
House.
The cost of the upgrade is to be
met from a capital expenditure
section of the college residence
account. This section holds funds
set aside for the upgrading of college
residences a n d the upgrade will
therefore not be a cause for further
rent increases.
Houses 43 and 44 have not been
converted this summer and will be
charged for at a reduced ' n o n -
upgraded' rate.
The aborted expansion of STA travel
has left the Imperial College Union
Sportshop without a site for
Freshers' week.
B o o k s h o p a n d S p o r t s h o p
manager, Roy Hicks, told FELIX
that the Bookshop Management
Committee had agreed to relocate
the Sportshop. When asked where
the new location was likely to be M r
Hicks said 'If I knew I'd be a happy
man.' He went on to say that he had
'lost 2 weeks sales which we can ill
afford to lose.'
Freshers' week and the following
month are the busiest periods of
trade for the Sportshop, which ran
at a loss last year.
