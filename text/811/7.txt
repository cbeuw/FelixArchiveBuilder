This restaurant has enjoyed far too much
glory from the student scene in London, but
it is cheap and the food is pleasant.

This is reputed to be a very popular

Mon-Sun noon-10.30pm
Tube Holborn or Sloane Sq.
Many students I have met have praised their
pancakes. The pancakes are made in the
Dutch style and served on 16" blue porcelain
plates imported from Holland. There is quite
a lot of choice, but the favourites seem to be
the M y Old Dutch Savoury ( a pancake wtih
bacon, ham, sweet pepper & vegetables
bathed in cheese) and the banana & sultana
& creme de cacao pancake.
A side salad, a pancake, a dessert and a non-
alcoholic drink can be expected to set you back
£ 5 . 5 0 - 6 . 0 0 .

Eating Chinese in Soho
The Dim Sum experience.
If you have never had Dim Sum then you
i must earmark a day in your diary for doing
so. One should think of it as an opportunity
' to be a gourmet. Rather than eating a lot of
a handful of things one gets small portions of
steamed stuffed wontons, a steamed
• dumplings, steamed duck's feet. Most items
will be served in their individual baskets in
which they were steamed. Most dim sum
. 'courses' will cost £ 1 . 1 0 but can be as much
as £ 1 . 7 0 or £ 2 . 5 0 . One can end up spending
upto £ 8 if you try too many items. Be brave
and try everything, including the tripe !!
Dim sum is recommended at the New
World Restaurant at 1 Gerrard Place, W l .
(Open every day ll:00am-ll;45pm, although
Dim Sum is only served upto 6pm). Go on a
' Sunday but make sure you arrive just before
" 11am. You will find the place full of people,
• many of them Chinese.

Tube Leicester Sq.
This must be a well worn spot in the student
eating scene. Although I no longer go there
I am sure many of you will get to love (!?) the
place. The queues to get a seat, sharing tables
with other people, and the lousy service give
the place a charm of its own. It's so good to
be treated like a student because you know
it will not cost you an arm and a leg. I
• remember that I always used to enjoy their
• grilled fish ( a trifle expensive at £ 4 . 7 0 ) and
• their Singapore style fried noodles.
Poons

Tube Leicester Sq.
Openings noon-llpm .
Cost Cheap- Marginally expensive.
I find that this is a pleasant spot in Soho to
dine the Ladies . I would recommend making
a reservation if you are going on a Friday or
Saturday, evening. Keep things simple by
trying one of their Hot Pots with some rice or
for something even cheaper they offer a plate
' of rice with a large ladle full of cooked meat
added over it. There are a number of choice
; items that can be added to accompany the rice.
FELIX
Food
Malaysian
Malaysia Hall
44 Bryanston So..
Tube Marble Arch
Openings llam-2pm and 5pm-9pm.
Cost Damn Cheap !
The hall is run efficiently because of the
large number of Malaysian students in
London. This is a special tip for those of you
who would like to get familiar with the
pleasure of eating food with the authentic
Malaysian touch. £ 1 . 6 0 will get you a rice,
vegetable dish & a chicken or lamb or squid
dish. There will not be much variety but you
can only ask for so much.
Rasa Sayang
3 Leicester Sq.
Tube : Leicester Sq.
Cost : £ 1 5 / h e a d .
There are occasions when one is in Soho and
. one does not fancy a Chinese. Consider eating
. at this restaurant if you do not mind spending
£ 1 5 / h e a d without wine !
The outstanding things to try are the satay
( skewered grilled pieces of meat served in a
peanut sauce), the fish curry, sambal ikan billis
(anchovies with chilli sauce) and the rendan.
Beef or chicken rendan must figure amongst
"the world's gastronomic crown jewels. A
heavenly coconut taste is developed by
roasting the coconut white before it is ground
into a paste. The meat is cooked with the
coconut paste and other exotic in gredients to
render a dish fit for a king. A friend spent two
hours of hard labour to make this dish for me.
I do not think that Rasa Sayang could ever
match his creation but their efforts should still
be worth trying.
If you want to avoid the hassle of selecting
items from the menu try the 'Nasi Lemak'.
This is a whole meal which is normally had
at breakfast but could be tried in London at
any time of the day. Coconut rice is served
with fish, prawns, egg, cucumber, anchovies
and chilli sauce.
Ghanian
Ghanian Student's Hostel
3 Collingham Gardens, SW5.
7 days, 12.30-6.30 pm.
Tube Earl's Court.
Cost Damn cheap.
I have never been to eat there but I am told
it is worth visiting. They cook only a few hot
dishes each day. You can expect good
helpings of Ghanian food.
Go and eat your hearts out, but do not come
to me for Alka-Seltzer. If you share my
passion for food, then keep your stomachs
glued to this column.
