Half a feature on the history of language
First words
Since the dawn of mankind the
importance of language has made it
an object of fascination and magical
properties. Ancient man, and even
the more 'primitive' peoples of
today, believed that to be able to
name a thing was to control or
possess it—an attitude that survives
in more developed societies with the
use of euphemisms for harsh
realities, such as death.

The link may not be as direct as
this, but language is nevertheless
essential for the workings of human
society. It is one of the clearest
differences between man and other
animals, and its development has
made possible some of the most
rapid changes the human race has
gone through. Without language
the transmission of new ideas and
hard-earned knowledge would be
impossible. The effect is seen in that
while man has rapidly changed in
habits and speech, there is no
evidence to show that animals,
without the ability to pass on
acquired knowledge, have
significantly changed in their basic
habits over comparable amounts of
time.
Recognising the position of
language as one of the strongest
bonds in society, people have been
fascinated by the question of its
origin throughout history. The
Biblical story of the Tower of Babel,
for example, shows some early
beliefs about the subject.
Now the whole world had one
language and a common speech. As men
moved eastward they found a plain in
Babylonia and settled there.
... Then they said, 'Come let us build
ourselves a city, with a tower that
reaches to the heavens, so that we may
make a name for ourselves and not be
scattered over the face of the whole
earth.'
But the Lord came down to see the city
and the tower that the men were
building. The Lord said, 'Ifas one people
speaking the same language they have
begun to do this, then nothing they plan
to do will be impossiblefor them. Come,
let us go down and confuse their
language so they will not understand
each other.'
So the Lord scattered them from there
over all the earth, and they stopped
building the city. (Genesis 11)
This story illustrates several
interesting points. Firstly it suggests
a divine interest in speech. Next, it
acknowledges the power language
gives man in relation to his
environment. And lastly, it attempts
to explain linguistic diversity—the
presence of so many different and
mutually unintelligible languages.
The idea of a divine interest in
language is found in several
independent traditions. While the
Bible, relating ancient Jewish beliefs,
describes God as bringing the
that of the Bible, whereas Indian
legends say that the god Indra
invented articulate speech. Even the
ancient Greeks in various writings
mention the gods as having first
fixed the names of things, and credit
a figure from myth with producing
the first alphabet from an earlier
Phoenician script. Writing in general
was regarded with awe; the Norse
god Odin was said to have invented
the runic script, and over time the
runes themselves acquired magical
significance.
More scientific explanations for
the origin of language have been
sought from early times. The Greek
historian Herodotus tells of an
experiment by Psammetichus, King
of Egypt, to find out whether the
Phrygians were an older race than
the Egyptians. To this end he had
Cave paintings show man communicating without a system of writing
animals to Adam for him to name, a child of each race brought up
the Arabic version has God handing without hearing any language
to Adam the complete language whatsoever. When tested, the
including its writing system. Norse children asked for food using the
mythology tells a story similar to Phrygian word for bread, 'bekos',
thus 'proving' that Phrygian was
the oldest language of mankind.
Only recently have people
realised that the process of linguistic
change dooms any attempt to
identify an existing language as the

original language to failure.
Painstaking work can, and has,
traced the development of known
languages, and the way older
tongues have given rise to modern
ones. But the oldest languages we
have any record of, in the form of
scraps of writing, are only four or
five thousand years old. The earliest
languages must have been nearly
coeval with man, and Homo sapiens
evolved at least half a million years
ago.
Various theories attempt to trace
the first steps in the history of
speech. One theory suggested that
language developed from imitations
of the cries of animals and birds, or
from sounds of pain or joy. This
assumes that onomatopoeia was the
essence of language, and by the 19th
century was thought to be
inadequate, being derisively termed
the bowwow and pooh-pooh
theories.
It is clearly impossible to
reconstruct the very first form of
language, but one can try to
determine the conditions in which
speech became possible. It seems
fair to assume that language only
developed when the brain became
capable of using it. Not enough is
known about the brain for definite
conclusions to be drawn from the
fossil skulls that have been found,
but attempts to interpret the
differences between these and
modern bones have been made.
Some people have concluded that
early ancestors of man must have
been aphasic—that is, without the
capacity for articulate speech. What
is certain is that early humans were
less well adapted to speech than
