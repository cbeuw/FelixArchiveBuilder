Union
Deputy President
Chas Brereton
Hello, my name is Charles
Brereton and I am the Union Deputy
President. This article is intended to
bring people up to date with what's
been happening in the Union
Building over the Summer and also
to explain some of the things you
will need to know, especially if you
are a Fresher.
Union Building Refurbishment
This is by far the most important
development over the Summer. The
Snack Bar, Union Bar, Ents Lounge
and Video Games room have all
been refurbished, and I hope that as
many of you as possible will use the
improved facilities that we have to
offer. The Snack Bar itself will be
serving food which has a healthy
bias, yet is appetising. The Union
Bar has had the traditional oak-
panneling completely refinished,
and new lighting and furniture
installed. The Ents lounge has had
a new lighting tower and stage
constructed, and a permanent
lighting rig has been installed for
discos and bands.
Union Cards
A Union card is your identification
within College; you should carry it
at all times. You will need your
registration slip (available in the
Junior Common Room) and two
passport-size photos. We have a
photo machine in the Union
Building foyer where these can be
obtained. On the reverse of the card
are useful telephone numbers which
you can use in case of emergency.
The card folds in half so you can slip
it into your wallet.
Union cards are available in the
Union Dining Hall throughout
Freshers' Week.
Rape Alarms
All women students can obtain a
rape alarm free of charge from the
Union office on production of a valid
registration slip or Union card. The
alarm emits a loud screeching noise
when activated. Please note that
"Mace" sprays (available on the
continent) are illegal in this country.
Academic Affairs
Overseas Students
If you have any academic
questions or worries, or if you are
an overseas student with a problem,
then feel free to drop in to the Union
Office and I'll try to help you as best
I can. The areas in question are
those which I will be representing
you to College, so if there is a matter
which you think is important, please
let me know. You can also contact
the relevant officers: Richard
Spencer (Academic Affairs Officer),
Mech Eng 3 and Amin El-Kholy
(Overseas Students Committee
Chairman), Computing 2.
I hope to see you all at the
IFreshers' U G M on Thursday 6th, in
|the JCR.
Events Hon Sec
Ian 'wendy' Morris
My intention of having an
organised, perhaps even relaxed,
Summer were completely wrecked
by the postal strike which meant
that arrangements were delayed
until the last few weeks before the
term started.
Under normal circumstances all
Freshers would have received a big
brown envelope containing
handbooks and other goodies at
least two weeks prior to arriving at
College. You may already have
received this envelope by the time
you read this but if not you'll be
getting one at the Rector's
reception.
The events for Freshers' week are
detailed in the handbook on page 15
and a week ticket (for which a form
is in the envelope) covering entry to
the events on Monday, Wednesday
& Friday can be obtained for Â£9 after
the reception outside the great hall,
in the Junior Common Room (JCR)
and on the first floor of the Union
Building (where you also get your
Union cards). The week's
entertainments are well worth going
to and should keep you busy, if a
little tired. Over the next few weeks
there will be regular discos, bar
quizzes and Ents gigs all of which
are detailed in the term planner as
well as special events like Rag Week
(see pages 12 & 13 of the handbook).
If you are at all interested in
getting involved with College
entertainments, have a word with
either myself or Paul Watkiss, the
Ents Chairman. Don't be put off
because you are new to College; this
year's Ents Hon Sec was a Fresher
last year who began helping out at
the New Year's Party even though
he had already paid to get in!
On a different note, there are a
number of Union positions which
have been left vacant due to
examination failure. These positions
are:
External Affairs Officer
Welfare Officer
Accomodation Officer
House Committee Chairman
FELIX Business Manager
Publicity Officer
:
Papers for these positions will be
up by the time this issue comes out
in the main entrance to the Union
Building (near the photo booth) and
will remain up for ten College days.
A proposer and ten seconders are
required for each candidate and the
election will take place at the second
Union General Meeting (UGM) on
25 October.
If you want any further
information on these positions, drop
into the Union Office and have a
word with either myself or Nigel.
Speaking of UGMs, the first of
these is on Thursday at 1.00 pm in
the JCR. Unlike many student
Unions, Imperial's is apolitical so
don't let any stereotypical
preconceptions prevent you from
finding out what the meetings really
deal with.
On Tuesday (tommorrow)
afternoon, the Freshers' Fair will
take place all over the College
campus. Take your time to wander
round the stalls and find out what
the clubs and societies have to offer.
Finally have an enjoyable year and
make time to enjoy the social
timetable available this year.
President
Nigel D Baker
1. Accommodation. I have
appointed the Wardens and Student
Managers of Hamlet Gardens,
Collingham Place and Gerrard
Mansions. There has also been a
survey of all the halls and houses to
build up a database of the
accomodation stock of IC.
2. External Affairs. The DES survey
of student Unions and their
associations with the NUS has
started. I have written to the DES
asking why ICU, the only Union of
a reasonable size not in the NUS,
has not been included in those
surveyed.
3. Postgraduate Affairs. I am in the
process of setting up a system of
departmental representatives for
postgrads which is to run along the
same lines as the current Dep Rep
system. An open meeting for all
postgraduates held in September
ifell foul of postgraduate apathy and
so this is to be pursued along
departmental lines with any
apathetic department being left to
stew in its own mess.
4. Welfare. I have been in
consultation with U L U with a view
to appointing a joint ICU/ULU
Welfare advisor. This proved
| fruitless and so I'm now looking into
ithe funding for a full-time ICU
j Welfare advisor. There will be the
largest survey of IC students ever
attempted this term. All 5,500
students will receive a survey paper.
In the past problems have been
encountered with collation and
analysis of the data. This year I have
arranged for "Audience Selection",
a market research company, to do
this for us, free of charge. There will
be a follow up survey in the
Summer term. This second survey
will measure how attitudes have
changed after the four campaigns
that will be run this year. These are:
(i) Alcohol awareness 28 Nov - 3
Dec.(ii) Sexuality awareness 9-14
January.(iii) Drug abuse/healthy
eating 14-18 February, (iv)
DHSS/Housing awareness 6-11
March.
5. St. Mary's. I have had several
meetings with Phil Drew, the St.
Mary's President, and we have set
up a working party which includes
myself, the ICU DP and the three
CCU Presidents. This working party
is to cover what we have identified
as 13 discrete areas and it should
report back by March next year.
6. Transport. Now that I am
covering the administration of the
transport fleet I will be taking a very
tough line with regard to bills and
abuses of the fleet.
