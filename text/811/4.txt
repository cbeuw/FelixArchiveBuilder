Summer News Update
Students Protest at Proposed
Silwood Conference Centre
The College is looking into plans
to convert the Main House at
Silwood Park into a conference
centre. Students at Silwood are
worried about the effect the center
will have on their own facilities.
Silwood Park hope to earn money
by building a centre which will
provide accommodation for thirty
people. The centre will contain a
restaurant and private dmning room
and the College are considering a
plan to use profits from Harlington
Gravel to build a swimming pool
and a squash court for conference
guests, staff and students.
Plans for the center have been
draughted and the Biology
Department has been moved into
new buildings to make room for the
centre. The College is currently
trying to raise money for the project,
estimated at between £1.4 and £ 4
million pounds and is hoping to
conduct a feasibility study on the
scheme.
Should the project prove
successful, a second accommodation
block for conference guests and a
new lecture theatre for the main
house is planned.
The students at Silwood are
concened that the development will
result in the loss of the Student's
Union's facilities. They are worried
that they will be unable to use the
Hall and Conservatory in the Main
House for regular Social events as
they do at present. They are also
unhappy about Colleges plans to
move the bar into the main house,
and at the loss of the 'Gnomes'
kitchen area.
The college have decided to
replace the bar currently used by the
students with a plush bar in the
main house. The new bar will serve
drinks at an increased price to
Evelyn Houses Merge
Mining House and Southwell
House, in Evelyn Gardens, are to be
joined to form a hall for 160 or so
students by the beginning of next
term. Ken Young, the present
Warden for Southwell House, will
be Warden for the new hall.
The decision to merger the houses
was taken when Catherine Brown,
Warden of Mining House, resigned
to complete her PhD and Mr Young
was appointed as Warden of
Southwell House. The move is in
line with the present Student
Residence Committee (SRC) policy
to move towards larger halls and
should lead to an overall increase in
the number of student rooms in the
hall.
The SRC are also to consider the
merger of Willis Jackson House and
Holbein House next year. SRC
Chairman, Brian Levitt told FELIX
that the present all male Holbein
House and the mixed Willis Jackson
House may be interchanged in time
for next year.
The cost of converting the two
houses into one, by knocking walls
through and converting triple rooms
into doubles and singles will be met
by funds left to the College by Mr
P R Monk, an ex-lecturer at
Imperial. The legacy of around
£80,000 was left by Mr Monk to
provide accommodation for
members of staff. The new hall will
house Mr Young and his wife in a
larger Warden flat than is presently
available and will provide further
student rooms from the second
redundant Warden flat. The naming
of the new hall is currently under
debate although 'Southwell HalT
and 'Monk Hall' have been
mentioned as possibilities. Imperial j
College President, Nigel Baker, told
FELIX that he and Mr Young j
preferred 'Monk Hall' as a possible ,
name since they felt that renaming
it 'Southwell HalT could lead to ill-
feeling from Mining House drinking
club, "The Diggers'.

conference guests, but will be open
to students in the evening to serve
drinks at a cheaper price. The
Students will be able to use the old
bar area, but it will not be available
for serving drinks. The Union are
unhappy with this arrangement
because it will separate the bar from
their other facilities.
"Its no use having a split union
with a bar on one site and facilities
on another site" said Union
President Ian Lowles.
The College has given verbal
assurances to the Students that they
will be able to book rooms in the
center on a 'first come first serve'
basis, but it is likely that they will
have to book the rooms a number
of months in advance. The union
fear that this will put an end to their
social events.
"It may mean that students have
there is a limit to the number of
buildings which can be built on the
site at once. The Estates Secretary,
Cameron Clark told FELIX that
there were no immediate plans to
use the union building, but said that
the building "may or may not be the
sight for a new accommodation
block" in the future,
to get organised to use the house"
said Keith Fisher, Silwood
Administrator.
Mr Fisher has written to the Royal
College of Science Union warning
them that the Main House may not
be available for the RCS Silwood
Ball next year.
The long term future of the
Union's facilities is uncertain. The
Union fear that their building may
have to be demolished to make for
the planned expansion in the
