modern man, and similarly limited
in their intellectual activity. From
these facts it has been suggested
that in the beginning speech was
purely emotive, perhaps starting as
a chant for keeping time. Though
sounds showing emotion, perhaps
combined with animal imitations,
would hardly make a language on
their own, they do seem a
reasonable starting point for one.
In the beginning
speech was purely
emotive
The breakthrough would have come
when such noises took on a
symbolic value, with the signs
separated from the objects so that
they could be used for
communicating, to anticipate or
provoke certain actions by others.
A question that has frequently
interested linguists is whether
language had a single origin, or if
several languages evolved from
different starting points. This is a
problem closely linked with the
origin of the human race. More
precisely, it depends on when man
became man rather than simply a
creature that resembled an ape. The
birthplace of man is generally
regarded as being in Africa, where
fossils of an early stage,
Aegyptopithecus (from about 35
million years ago), have been found.
The Petralona skull—borderline
Homo sapiens (from 0.5 million
years ago)
But from 25 million years ago, when
the physical links betweeen Africa
and Eurasia were re-established,
man's ancestors began to spread
into the other two continents. The
question is how soon in the
development of the species the
capacity to use language appeared.
Often when a certain level of
progress has been reached the same
discovery is made in several places
at once. This may be what
happened, but since a spoken
language leaves no traces, there is
no evidence either way.

The Meditation Group offers free courses of instruction from an
experienced teacher and chosen visiting teachers.
The course will help to reduce physical and mental stress, also it helps
to develop increased concentration and calmness (very good for exam
nerves). We have group discussions each week and are guided by our
teacher along our individual ways. It's a form of meditation called
'Samatha', which is found in modern Thailand, although it originated from
Sri Lanka. It has adapted in this case to the hectic life of a Londoner so
that you won't lose what little remains of your sanity...
You are very welcome to join the group at any stage. Meetings
are held regularly in ULU on Wednesday evenings at 7.00pm.
