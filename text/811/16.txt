'...a calm delight which is
inexpressible and which no
situation on earth could give.'
Vincent Lunardi (1784)
Throughout history people have
been fascinated by the seemingly
impossible, being able to fly is one
of them. In 1783 flying left the
realms of fantasy when the first
ever 'aircraft' made its maiden
voyage over Paris. The French
Montgolfier brothers had
constructed a hot-air balloon out
of paper and powered by a fire
made of burning straw and twigs!
It rose to 1000ft but soon fell back
to earth as the hot air escaped.
A few months later Professor
Charles, a physicist, filled a
rubber-coated balloon with
hydrogen and the first gas balloon
took off. Landing just outside
Paris it was attacked by peasants
who thought it was the devil.
Since hydrogen has better lifting
properties than hot air, gas
balloons could be smaller and
more practical than the
cumbersome and rather
dangerous hot-air ballons. Hot-air
ballooning had died a quick
death.
However, 200 years later hot-air
ballooning re-emerged when Don
Piccard was commissioned to
investigate the military
possibilities by the United States
Navy in the 1960s. The balloon
was to be built from light-weight,
high tension rip-stop fabric and
have a powerful propane burner
system. Although this application
did not develop, the sport of hot-
air ballooning had been born,
thanks to modern technology.
Today traditional gas ballooning
is rather out-dated with its bags
of ballast, ropes and anchors.
Little has changed over the past
two centuries except that helium
is used instead of hydrogen (the
Hindenburg disaster high-lighted
the dangers of using hydrogen!).
A hot-air balloon can be inflated
virtually anywhere and much
more quickly than a gas balloon.
Since the operating costs of hot-
air ballooning are a fraction of
those of a gas balloon, hot-air
ballooning has become popular all
over the world.
Balloons can take you out of this
world in the most graceful style.
To float away is to realise the
fantasy of living in the clouds.
One is surrounded by a totally
unearthly beauty, free at last from
life's problems. To ride with the
wind is to experience tranquillity
and real adventure.
As the balloon takes off there is
no real upward sensation as in an
aeroplane, but rather, the earth
just drops away from under your
feet. The land below takes on new
dimensions—fields and lakes
stitched together in a multi-
coloured quilt stretching in all
directions.
In level flight the balloon is in
equilibrium. To go up by
'burning' the blast-valve is
opened. This causes a 7ft flame to
shoot into the envelope and heat
the air. To come down one can
either allow the balloon to cool or
open a vent in the top of the
balloon allowing hot air to escape
giving a more rapid descent.
The balloon's direction depends
solely on the wind but pilots can
attempt to 'steer' by changing
altitude since different wind
directions can occur at different
heights. In the end though, the
ballooning becomes a magical
mystery flight to an unpredictable
destination.
The most testing part of any
flight, whether by Concorde or
balloon, is the landing. But it is
only balloonists who must suffer
the indignity of being dragged
across a field in what is essentially
a wicker basket! Pilots take great
care to avoid landing in farmers'
crops, near animals or near
electricity pylons. If everything
has gone well the retrieve crew
will be waiting nearby, having
successfully tracked the balloon to
its final resting place. It is not
uncommon for 'retrieve' to get
lost or the pilot to land in the most
inaccessible spot.
It is now possible to make
almost any object fly! Special
shaped balloons are flown at
many balloon fiestas around the
country. Have you ever seen a
flying Donald Duck, ice-cream
cone, FT paper, Sydney Opera
House, motor bike, dragon... to
name but a few!
Ever fancied flying? Now may
be your chance—anybody can do
it!

The Hermit of Eyton Forest is the
fourteenth and last (so far) of a
series by Ellis Peters. Set around the
Abbey of St Peter and St Paul in
12th Century Shrewsbury, the
books are described as 'mediaeval
whodunnits', but they are both less,
and more.
Those looking for a fiendishly
complex, fast-paced plot can stop
reading here. The story is based
firmly in the slower rhythms of
mediaeval life; indeed it is in part
the meticulous detail and authentic
atmosphere which make all the
books in this series a pleasure to
read.
The plots themselves are usually
original and intriguing, often resting
on some historical detail such as, in
The Hermit of Eyton Forest, the
practice of marrying young children
off for the sake of their estates. The
civil war, with King Stephen and
Empress Maud fighting for the
English throne, is ever-present in
the background and though we are
spared tedious descriptions of the
course of the battles, we are told
enough to explain the motivations
and actions of many of the people
in the stories. I can't vouch for the
historical accuracy, but it sounds
well-researched and convincing.
Despite the amount of specialist
knowledge involved, the author
generally plays fair, not withholding
vital information needed for the
solution. Unfortunately this means
that the crime, if there is cne, is
usually solvable well before the end
of the book. On the other hand, one
can then relax and enjoy the way the
characters resolve their various
problems.
What makes this series worth
reading as far as I am concerned is
the main character. Brother Cadfael,
in charge of the Abbey's herb
gardens and the medicines (and
wines) made from its produce, is the
kind of man I'd be proud to know,
let alone to have invented. A warrior
in the Crusades before taking his
vows, Cadfael has a practical faith
that sees looking after people as
more important than the prescribed
round of worship in church, yet is
so contented in the service of God
that it makes even a confirmed non-
believer like myself understand how
some people find happiness in the
cloisters. And who could fail to
warm to someone who takes such
pleasure in the rare chance to ride
a horse Kgain, or in looking at
beauty in nature or man? Other
characters that come to life in the
books include the capable Hugh
Beringar, sheriff of Shrewsbury, and
his wife Aline, and the not-so-
lovable Brother Jerome who helps
show that not all who retreat from
the world retreat from the search for
power.
Not only has the author taken care
to weave characters and conditions
into a readable whole, but the use
of language is precise and fresh and
should please anyone who enjoys
reading a carefully crafted story. The
front covers of the books give a fair
imitation of an uluminated page but
bear no comparison with the real
thing.
