Summer News Update
College Gambles on New Hall
The College has purchased a new
student residence in Earl's Court to
house about 40 students. The
College Secretary, John Smith
exchanged contracts for the former
Girl Guides Hostel, Olave House on
2 September. The rental for the new
residence will be set at £ 5 5 per
week. Although this figure will not
be suffient to pay off the interest on
the loan taken out for the property,
the College are gambling that
accumulated interest will be offset
by the rise in value of the property.
Mr Smith hopes that part of the
£1.6 million cost of the purchase will
be met by the Sherfield Trust, with
the balance of around £1.3 million
to be financed by a loan. The
Sherfield Trust is legally
independent of the College and is
administered by a group of trustees,
mostly made up of the College's
governors. Mr Smith is the
Secretary of the Trust.
The £1.6 million bid was referred
to the Charities Commission a
month ago since the Girl Guides
Association is a registered charity,
and was returned last week. The
purchase has been described as 'a
gamble' by Mr Smith and Senior
Assistant Finance Officer, Malcolm
Aldridge.
Mr Smith told FELLX that students
living in the new house would have
to pay £100 per week to cover the
loan interest and this was not
feasible. Mr Smith hopes to reduce
the loan by securing funds from
other trusts. Mr Aldridge told FELIX
that if this fails the loan capital will
continue to increase at a hopefully
lower rate than the property value
rise. The £1.6 million bid for the
property was tendered when
interest rates were lower than at
present and property values in
central London were rising at a
higher rate.
Mr Smith stressed that the cost of
the purchase would not be
transferred to students outside
Olave House, in line with the
College's agreement with former
ICU President, Christine Taig. The
College agreed not to transfer the
cost of any further purchases to the
overall students residence account
after the purchase of Fisher Hall.
The new house is made up of two
Victorian houses with three floors,
accommodating around 40 students.
Mr Smith told FELIX that the
property was ideally suited to the
College's needs since it has been
used as a hostel and offers
immediate occupation, although
some work will be required in the
kitchen areas. The work will take a
month or so, during which students
will be given meal vouchers for use
in the College refectories. He went
on to say that he had discarded
several other properties, which were
not suitable for immediate use. He
said 'People are always accusing me
of not taking risks, and now I'm
taking one'. He hopes that the
financial situation for the new
purchases 'should look reasonable'
after three to five years.
Hamlet Gardens Trashed
Three groups of squatters w
evicted last Friday from the student
residences in Hamlet Gardens
following a court injunction. The
squatters have caused several
thousand pounds worth of damage
and have been threatening the
Hamlet Gardens staff with violence.
Some of the squatters have since
broken into another Hamlet
Gardens flat owned by the Notting
Hill Housing Trust.
The squatters have been living in
flats 131, 137 and 135 since they
were vacated at the end of last term.
The occupants of one of the flats had
been living in the College's 200
block since Christmas until they
were evicted by builders working for
the landlords, Strolmor at the end
of term.
The squatters have been regularly
hurling abuse at the student
managers in Hamlet's Summer
Letting Scheme. One of the
managers, Steve Mercer, told FELIX
that the squatters had hit him in the
ribs with a snooker cue and said that
one of the squatters had threatened
to set a vicious dog onto the staff.
Several residents have also been
threatened including an old lady
who is now too frightened to talk to
the police. The managers also
believe that the squatters are
responsible for a burglary in one of
the flats on July 18th in which Hi Fi
and jewelry were stolen.
Accommodation officer, Loretto
O'Callaghan told FELIX that the
squatters had left the flats in a
disgusting state. One of the flats
was covered in abusive graffiti
directed at the student managers.
Contract cleaners refused to clean
another flat where the squatters
kept a dog and eleven puppies
locked inside. The furniture inside
another flat had been thrown out of
the windows.
Summer Letting Scheme finishes.
Mrs O'Callaghan is considering
plans to give students a weeks free
accommodation in an attempt to
ensure that the flats are not left
empty.
Mrs O'Callaghan is critical of the
lack of support given to her by the
police. "Hammersmith Police
Station is very unhelpful and didn't
want to get involved" she said. She
is currently negotiating with the
College to persuade them to take the
squatters to court for assault. She
has asked College to help with the
costs, should the student managers
decide to prosecute.
College Security Chief, Geoff
Reeves told FELIX that the College
had no plans to hire security guards
to police Hamlet when the flats are
vacated at the end of Summer. He
said that the flats were too dispersed
to police effectively and added that
security firms would be unwilling to
deal with the squatters, who he
described as 'psychopaths'. He
went on to say that the only legal
way of removing squatters was to
apply for a court injuction, a process
which can take months.
Mr Reeves is planning to write to
the Commissioner of Police, the
Secretary of State for the
Environment and the Home
Secretary in an attempt to prevent
the problem recurring. "We need to
get the law clarified with respect to
our property" said Mr Reeves.
