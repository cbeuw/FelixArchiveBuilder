.Regular income,
pod prospects.
.My grant
cheque's doing better
than I am?
There was a time when it was easy for
banks to rope in students; just give them a
few quid, throw in half price bus fares and
they were happy.
But not any more; today it seems you
want someming that's rather more substantial.
And quite right too.
So with this in mind, we've created
Headway, a package that's worth over £100
to the average student (if such a thing exists).
For the first time ever, we'll pay you
monthly interest on any money in your
current account.
So the minute you bank your grant
cheque, it'll be making you money.
What's more we're guaranteeing you
free banking for as long as you're a student.
And should you become financially
embarrassed towards the end of term, the
prospect of a £200 interest-free overdraft
should be very comforting.
You'll also have the opportunity to
apply for an Access card, which in turn
entitles you to a free personal organiser.
And to qualify for this amazing offer?
You've guessed it. You simply open a
Lloyds Bank Account.
Nearest branches are at
67-69 Old Brompton Road, SW7 and
50 Gloucester Road, SW7.
