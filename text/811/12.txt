Edinburgh 88
One of the most wonderful cities
on earth is Edinburgh during the
International Festival. There are
thousands of people from hundreds
of nations. There are spectacular
firework displays, the military
Tattoo in the castle that seems to
dominate all Edinburgh and
everywhere you look are the
theatres and venues of the Festival
Fringe. It is a breathtaking dive into
a cultural and artistic pleasure
ground.
One of the five top venues on the
Fringe is Theatre West End, situated
in the hall of St. John's Church, at
the west end of the main shopping
thoroughfare, Princes Street. This is
not, however, run by a professional
company but (mostly) by students
from Imperial College.
Preparations for the three brief
weeks of the Festival begin in
December when the Administrator,
Technical Co-ordinator and the rest
of the organising committee are
elected. They work for nine months,
basing with the theatre groups to
whom the venue is sublet,
arranging technical facilities for
them, hiring equipment, leasing the
actual hall and carrying out the
thousands of tasks that must be
completed in order to make the
venue perfect for the opening night.
Activity comes to a head
approximately two weeks before the
Festival opens, when all the
equipment, costumes, props and
publicity are brought together. On
the Saturday before the festival
opening, people are bullied, cajoled
or forced to assemble to load
everything into the van which will
take it all to Edinburgh. This is a
seemingly endless handling and
passing of heavy boxes, boards and
plastic sacks which are fitted into the
van like a three dimensional jigsaw.
The van departs and everyone
then tries to get themselves to
Edinburgh, by train, coach or car
(which didn't prove to be the most
reliable method this year!). This is
brief respite before reaching
Edinburgh, where the van is
unloaded. (Much the same as
loading except that everything has
to be carried further, and round
some awkward corners.) And then
the set up begins.
In four days a bare church hall is
transformed into a one hundred and
twenty seat studio theatre, complete
with raked seating, a sophisticated
sound and lighting system, and
painted black throughout.
This may not sound much, but it
is four long days of very hard work,
which can be frustrating, exhausting
and unpleasant by turns, but which,
ultimately, end in a great sense of
achievement.
On the Thursday the theatre
inspectors visit and fortunately
grant us our theatre licence.
From Friday the sublet theatre
groups arrive (bringing, usually,
incredible amounts of props and
costumes, and making impossible
last minute demands on the
technical resources) and the first
performance occurs on Friday night.
A theatre has been born in less than
a week.
But why do students from
Imperial put themselves to so much
trouble ? The main reason is so that
IC Dramatic Society can themselves
perform at the Fringe. The cost of
hiring a venue is so prohibitive that
it becomes the only viable way to
take productions to the Fringe. This
year three productions were taken
up.
Dusa, Fish, Stas and Vi by Pam
Gems is a play about the interaction
of four women and the way in
which they support and protect
each other. This play gave the
opportunity for the strong presence
of good actresses in ICDS to show
their abilities.
Rumblings by Peter Gibbs, on the
other hand, is a sharp black comedy
about life in the office of the future,
where work is minimal and tensions
are running high. The actress in this
place made her stage debut in this
performance, and the play was well
received by its audiences.
Talk to me like the rain and let
me listen, by Tennesse Williams
was a two hander set in an
apartment in Manhattan, where a
couple are undergoing a reunion -
or finally drifting apart. This
probably contained the most
challenging part in any of the plays,
and Portia Smith did justice to her
theatre that took four days to build
is taken apart, packed away and
sent back to London. A bare church
hall reappears once more. However
nobody much cares at that point,
because it is seven o'clock in the
morning and we have been working
since half past ten the previous
night, mostly on auto-pilot, and all
we want to do is sleep.
But being a part of Theatre West
End is more than just creating and
destroying the theatre and carrying
out the day to day tasks such as
operating the box office, acting as a
'responsible manager' for the venue
or staffing the front of house. It is
about promoting your own shows
and terrorising the passing crowds
into seeing you. It is about chatting
to other theatre groups who are
leafleting you, and finding out what
they are doing and what they have
seen. It is about having a strong
constitution and sitting in the Fringe
club until three in the morning and
then getting up at nine after far too
little sleep.
Above all Edinburgh is about seeing
theatre, revues, concerts, serious
drama, farce and the unbelievably
strange. I think the Edinburgh
ten minute speech during which she
maintained a convincing American
accent. This played as a double bill
with Savagetove by Sam Shepherd,
a series of love poems, delivered by
a cast of four, casting new light on
the pains and pleasures of that
emotion.
The saddest part of the Edinburgh
experience occurs when, after three
weeks and fifteen shows, the strike
happens. In nine or ten hours the
cultural experience is best summed
up by the following: we wandered
into a theatre because we were
nearby and they had a performance
starting in twenty minutes time. We
came out shaken by the most
brilliant piece of theatre I have ever
seen. The company that produced
this (The Faith Healer by Brian Friel)
was not a professional outfit but
Edinburgh University Dramatic
Society.
