Summer News Update
Rector's Computer
Stolen
An IBM Computer system, valued
at £6000 was stolen from the
Rector's Electrical Engineering office
on July 15th. The incident is just one
in a series of thefts which have cost
the College insurers an estimated
£130,000.
Amongst the computers stolen
was an IBM Landmark computer
valued at £42,000, one of only three
in the world, which was taken from
the Royal School of Mines in April.
The spate of thefts began at the
start of the year when a BBC
microcomputer was stolen from
ICU's Microcomputer Club in the
Union Building. Since then 29
computers have been taken from
departments within College.
The thefts are believed to be the
work of ex-members of College,
who may be equiped with low level
College master keys.
Security Officer Terry Briley told
FELIX that many of the thefts were
made possible by people leaving
their offices unlocked. He added
that thieves were able to by pass the
security-desks by using back exits
left open by members of staff on
their way home.
Inspite of seveal sightings, the
thieves have eluded College security
officers.
Two men, described as Asian, one
5ft 6 and stocky and the other 5ft 9
and thin with spikey hair were seen
attempting to steel a computer in the
Electrical Engineering Department
in August, whilst in September, a
dark skinned man and a thin
female, were challenged by guards
in the Royal School of Mines on
September 7. The couple escaped,
leaving behind a computer stolen
from the Mechanical Engineering
Department. Several other sightings
have been reported.
The College had arranged for a
small squad of police officers to
patrol the College for two weeks
during the Summer. The plan met
with little success when the squad
was called away for three nights out
of four. Mr Briley hopes to be able
to arrange further police surveillance
in the future.
Mr Hyndes of the Computing
Centre has been given the task of
ensuring that the College's
remaining computers are better
protected. He told FELIX that the
door connecting the Royal School of
Mines with the Mechanical
Engineering Department would be
locked and that magnetic locks
would be fitted to the fire doors
within College. Departments will be
expected to pay for the locks which
are of a type which release in the
event of fire and cost £1000 to £2000.
Geology Slams UGC
Review
Following their review of Earth
Sciences, the University Grants
Committee have instructed
Imperial's Geology department to
reduce its quota of staff and
students. The department has been
told to lose 10 academic staff and 13
non—academic staff and to reduce
its annual undergraduate intake
from 45 to 32. As part of the UGC's
requirements, the department has
been 'reorganised' into teaching and
research divisions. The UGC's
decision has come under heavy fire
from academics within Geology.
The academics are critical of the
;UGC's alleged use of the Science
Citation Index as a means of
assessing the quantity of research
carried out at Imperial. They argue
that the index does not take into
account many of the journals which
publish the work from applied
Geology Departments such as
Imperial. They also point out that
much of the work carried out by the
department is for industry and
hence is not available for open
publication.
Head of the Geology Department,
Dr Richard Selley told FELIX that
the department was amongst the
top two or three in the country in
every criterion assessed by the UGC
Committee. 'We were told by a
member of the UGC Committee that
we were subjectively assessed,' he
said. He is critical of the fact that the
Chairman of the regional Earth
Sciences Committee spent only two
hours at the College before the
assessment was made. This is in
sharp contrast to the current U G C
review of Petroleum Engineering
during which the whole committee
visited the department for two days.
"The reviewers were basically
pure academic Geologists and were
reluctant to accept Imperial
College's international status,' he
said.
FELIX spoke to Professor Mc
Connell, regional chairman of the
Earth Sciences Review Committee.
Professor McConnell told FELIX that
the UGC's decision was based
primarily on a 'bid' made by the
department outlining their plans for
the next ten to fifteen years. 'The
UGC made a complete analysis of
the figures but they weren't
specifically used,' he said.
The bid was made by the
department as part of a detailed
dossier which the Geology
Department submitted to the U G C
at the beginning of the year. The
UGC were unhappy with the bid
and asked for it to be resubmitted
twice. The first draft of the bid called
for moderate increases in staff and
student numbers and equipment.
The revised version outlined the
planned 'restructuring' of the
department into teaching and
research sections.
According to the Department, the
UGC declined to say why they were
unhappy with the bid.' 'We didn't
know what we were were bidding
for,' said Dr Selley.
The Rector Professor Eric Ash,
told FELIX that the cutbacks would
be softened by support from
industry. Following a press
conference given by the Rector in
June, industry has sponsored two
lectureships and ii is hoped that
more will be forthcoming
Student
Unions
Alarmed by
DES
Survey
Student Unions are alarmed by a
nationwide survey designed to
assess the services provided by the
National Union of Students (NUS).
The survey, launched by the
Department of Education and
Science (DES), asks for detailed
breakdowns of union finances, and
voting procedures and asks Unions
to assess the services provided by
the NUS in financial terms.
The twenty-one page
questionnaire has been circulated to
the Vice-Chancellors, Directors and
Principals in seventy universities,
polytechnics and colleges of further
education. Brunei, Heriot-Watt,
Bristol, Loughborough and
Newcastle Universities are amongst
those on the list. The questionnaires
are due for completion by October
31, after which the Government will
draw 'conclusions on the best action
to take.'
The runs in the wake an
announcement by Secretary of State
for Education and Science, Kenneth
Baker, in April. Mr Baker said the
Government recognised that 'many
individual students do not wish to
be represented by the National
Union of Students.' He added that
taxpayers' money should be used to
provide services for students and
not for political campaigning.
The content of survey bears a
number of similarities to an Early
Day Motion on the 'National Union
of Students closed shop' put
forward by Timothy Janman MP, in
December. The EDM, an undebated
statement of support for an issue,
called for the Secretary of State for
Education and Science to take action
over the anomoly which allows the
NUS to run a 'closed shop'. This,
it is claimed, is not within the spirit
of the 1987 Employment Act which
aimed to 'significantly reverse
closed shop arrangements.'
More recently, Mr Janman
proposed an amendment to the
Government Education Reform Bill.
The amendment has been described
by the NUS as an attempt to outlaw
union affiliation with organisations
which do not provide goods or
services.
