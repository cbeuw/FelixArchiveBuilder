VISUAL ARTS
This years Photographic
Exhibition, whioh closets a f t e r
lunch today, i s a vesy fine
display. There are about ISO
prints on show and quite a
number of colour transparencies
Of these about 90 prints are
being sent to the U.I.TJ.
Exhibition.
Most of the photographs were
entered i n the Photo. Soc.
Competition which was judged
very competently by Mr.R.S.Wood
A.R.P.S. Thirty-four members of the Society entered
the competition. Mr.R.Wood (not the judge) won the
P i c t o r i a l section with a fine church study called
"Peace*. Mr.G.Matthews'led the Portraiture section
with a well composed photograph of a v i o l i n i s t .
The College A c t i v i t i e s section was won by Mr.A.
Eyoott who exhibited" h i s advertisment for "The
Lady's not for Burning" which included some fine
portraits of the actors. Mr.Eycott also took f i r s t
and,second prises i n the Record section. Mr.J.K.
Taylor won the Colour Print section through lack
of competition, but this does not reflect on the
quality of his prints. Mr.B.R.P.Cook swept the
board i n the Colour Transparency section winning
a l l three prizes.
On the whole the prints hung where of good quality,
though i n some cases the photographer had d i f f i c u l t y
in getting enough depth of focus. But i n one or two
Instances the mounting l e f t much to be desired.
Dr.Glaister loaned four of his prints, and Dr.
Haywood some excellent colour transparencies to
show what our elders can do.
On Monday evening after the Judge had given a
commentary on the exhibits the f i r s t Annual Dinner
of the Society was held. Prom the speeches given
after the dinner I gathered the deplorable fact
that although the Society has a record membership
of 180 this year only 7 or 8 people, including
committee members, turn up to talks given by outside
experts, and into which a l o t of work has been put.
The prizes were presented by Mr.Wood, the Glaister
Shield going to Mr.R.iTood for the best print i n the
competition, and the newly awarded Ruthen Cup to
Mr.Matthews for the best p o r t r a i t .
General Studies Debate
REPORT ON DEBATE: TUESDAY 28TH FEB.
In view of the gradual decline i n attendance
at General Studies lectures, the L i t . & Deb. Soc.
debated the motion that "This house condemns
General Studies". As was pointed out, anvone who
r e a l l y condemned them was u n l i k e l y to be present,
since the debate was held under the auspices of
General Studies. This suggestion was substant-
iated by Dr. Cohen and Mr. Wright, prooosing,
who took a iine of constructive c r i t i c i s m of the
presnet arrangements. The House Being largely
agreed, the debate took on a light-hearted char-
acter and we were treated to a touching picture
of Dr. Allan and Dr. Cohen indulging i n innocent
pleasure reading a Greek book together. In his'
amusing but sincere speech Dr. Allan expressed
concern at the lack of broad c u l t u r a l interest i n
Imperial College. He ventured to blame our foun-
ders f o r t h i s as they had planned I.C. as a t r a i n -
ing school f o r narrow minded scientists, and tech-
nicians; also, ours being a largely non-resident-
i a l college, we lose the opportunity of discussing
the unsolved problems of l i f e u n t i l two i n the
morning, which i s an important part of a u n i v e r s i t y
education.
Several suggestions for improvements i n the
General Studies programme were made from the f l o o r
but the irohiem of arousing the interest of stud-
ents who never or but rarely attended General
Studies lectures was not seriously consi* ere<T.
The motion was heavily defeated".
LITERATURE
TheSnrine; e d i t i o n of "hoeni
appeared to have lees mater
i a l i n i t then usual on res
lag the Â»>reefs, but the num-
ber of paces was the same.
Perhaps t i e larger namber o.
Illustrations' by Tony B a l l
contributed t o t h i s , bat i t
ie probably the nature of thi
a r t i c l e s which gives r i s e to t h i s impression. The:
are a l l immensely readable. In f a c t they are
entertaining, and none ef them i s long enough t o
be l o f t h a l f read, and give the usual larpression
of encyclepaediaical bulk to the reader.
I f one acknowledges that the review* of club
a c t i v i t i e s are included s o l e l y for record mtrnoses
then there i s no reason f o r being disappointed
with t h i s edition, and the l i g h t e r character of
the included material makes a pleasant r e l i e f
from the esoteric a r t i c l e s of previous issues.
DRAMA
The Imperial College
Dramatic Society, being
handicapped by lack of a stage
for t h e i r productions, lent
f u l l support to the University
Union's recent production o f
Dispersal.
The Society provided none
of the leading actors, but
.several members nlayed subsidary
roles very e f f e c t i v e l y . It was
behind the stage that most of
the I.C, e f f o r t was directed, and i s usual they
applied t h e i r s c i e n t i f i c knowledge to overcome
most of the l i m i t a t i o n s that they encountered.
During the l a s t two years the Jazz Club has
once again been established as a going concern
after being on the verge of e x t i n c t i o n .
With the formation this year of the I.C.Jazz
Band the Club can now be considered on par with
those of r i v a l colleges. Under the leadership of
Terry McVeigh the band made i t s debut at the jazz
hop held l a s t term and now regularly makes appear-
ances at college hops and carnivals.
Six lunch-time record r e c i t a l s have already
been given t h i s term, including one by Johnny
Parker, Humphrey Lyttelton's p i a n i s t . As i n the
past, the t r a d i t i o n a l i s t s seem to f a r outnumber
the modernist members of the club. Efforts by
secretary Howard Williams to remedy t h i s have not
met with much success. Nevertheless the impending
v i s i t of Stan Kenton to the Albert H a l l may yet
stimulate more interest i n the modern forms of
jasz.
Jazz at the college shows a definite up trend
t h i s year, and the large numbers attending the
Jive classes i s a very healthy sign.
