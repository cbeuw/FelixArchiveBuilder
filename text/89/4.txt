2nd March, 1956.
Dear S i r ,
At i s * l a s t I.C. Union M a t i n g , the Uniea
voted tar 888 votes to 252 against applying far
r e a f f l l i a t l o n to the National Union of Students.
The voting was arranged such that a number who
would otherwise abstained but remained i n the
•eating were included among the voters against
the motion. No announcement was made that the
abstainers should leave, and no count of abstainers
was taken. Also i t has been admitted that the
t e l l e r s o f the votes against the motion did not
come to agreement.
In view of these facts i t i s widely f e l t
that the r e s u l t s should be declared n u l l and void,
and that a secret b a l l o t should be held to decide
t h i s important issue. We f e e l that better arrange-
ments f o r the conduct of future Union meetings
should be made to prevent the recurrence of t h i s
and the premature ending of the meeting i n chaos.
Yours etc.,
C.J. Farrow.
P.M. Levin.
The President r e p l i e s :
This l e t t e r i n s u l t s the intelligence od pe >ple
who,it suggests, remained i n room 17 under the
impression that they were abstaining, and aat
watching t e l l e r s counting the number of peonie
i n the ro >m. It was stated quite d e f i n i t e l y
before a vote was taken what people i n eioh roo l
were voting f o r and , indeed 8 abstentions -wre
recorded i n the corridor between the two r?MES.
In room 17 four t e l l e r s gave t h e i r numbers
as 289, 288, 285 and 289; a reasonable error i n
human counting.
Mr Cox, the proposer of the motion, has
expressed no d i s s a t i s f a c t i o n with the r e s u l t .
The motion was defeated by a small but
decisive majority and the result can i n no way be
declared n u l l and void.
I.C. Union,
Dear S i r ,
I f e e l that I must c r i t i c i s e your e d i t o r i a l
of the l a s t issue of "FELIX", on the grounds that
i t i s both misleading and, to t h i s Society, i n -
s u l t i n g .
This Society arranged the entertainment
offered to the two American debaters and i f your
E d i t o r i a l i s to be believed I have "an axe t o
grind." I would suggest i n fact that I haven'tt
the debaters on the f i r s t day of t h e i r short stay
were entertained to lunch, shown round London and
taken to" dinner i n H a l l , and on the following day
shown a l i t t l e more of London. I believe that they
enjoyed a l l of these things. Could the Union have
done more? Short of rigourously c o n t r o l l i n g every
minute of the Americans' time the Union would
have had no more power than myself to stop them
meeting "axe-grinders" and i n general being baited.
This pre-supports that they d i d meet "axe-
grinders" and were baited, each of these to such
a degree that they " l e f t Imperial with the impres-
sion that i t was a hot bed of communist agitators;"
since the Americans met only one Communist t o the
best of my knowledge, t h i s i s t o say the least
surprising. I would point out tee. that f o r nearly
the whole of t h e i r stay they considered t h i s
p a r t i c u l a r communist a very pleasant chap and were
somewhat amused and amazed at the same time at
his b e l i e f s . I f they eventually t i r e d of .his
constant t a l k of p o l i t i c s they d i d no more than
I and many others d i d long age, and I am sure
they were not so f o o l i s h as to take h i s opinion
as that of Imperials' as your E d i t o r i a l claims.
No s i r . I i n s i s t the h o s p i t a l i t y offered
by t h i s Society was true h o s p i t a l i t y ; we arranged
for the Americans to debate here and as such
considered i t our place to entertain them and net
trouble the Union as a whole. You suggest we did
not do t h i s adequately, I disagree completely.
Yours etc.,

Dear S i r ,
After having witnessed the abortive
attempt of some I.C. students to remove the 3.E.C.
mascot at the conclusion of l a s t Saturday's hop,
thus causing nothing but a mess ori the f l o o r , i t
has struck me that the acquiring of other Colleges'
mascots f o r the purposes of painting or other
maltreatment seems to have reached r i d i c u l u s
l i m i t s .
The idea i s now no longer novel, and peonie
who participate i n t h i s form of rag are generally
now making a nuisance of themselves.
Yours e t c .
P.Sevier.
