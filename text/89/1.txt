WHAT HAPPENED
During the lunch hour of March 1st,,
there took place one of the most import-
ant I.C. Union meetings of recent years.
The attendance was a record, and Room 17
in Guilds r i v a l l e d the Black Hole of
Calcutta. The meeting was due t o s t a r t
at 1.15 p.m., but by 1 o'clock the back
of the room was almost f i l l e d by the
usual rowdy elements. Mr. Cox planted
a lepk ( i t being St. David's Day) against
the blackboard. The President on a r r i v -
a l replanted the vegetable i n front of
him on the bench despite c r i e s of "eat
i t " . Herbert appeared soon a f t e r and
was greeted with approval though i t was
probably the f i r s t time any of the f i r s t
year men had seen the Imperial Col lege
Mascot
The meeting opened, and Mr. K i t c h -
ener disposed of the minutes of the l a s t
meeting i n almost vulgar haste. Under
Matters A r i s i n g , Mr. Ibbotson rose to
say that on several occasions recently
he had been frustrated. He got no f u r -
ther with audible speech and the Union
put i t down to the process of growing
up. Under Cortesoondence, 'Kitch' read
a l e t t e r fron the Presi ent of King's
thanking I.C. f o r giving Reg<rie an under-
coat. This had sa^-ed King's a l o t of
trouble because they had intended to o
paint him anyway and now only needed to
apniy a top coat. The Uni in expressed
i t s contempt at such a weak excuse by
receiving the announcement i n complete
silence.
The next item on the agenda was
Grants. The Council had taken acti-in
on the motion by Messrs. Walnole.and
Davies passed at the previous meeting.
Among other things, they had irovided
the opportunity f o r individual students
to have t h e i r cases of inadequate grants
taken up, Mr. Anderson had v/ritten a
l e t t e r to FELIX informing the college of
the arrangements. Not one person had
taken advantage of tl ese and though they
were s t i l l open, the value of Mr. Wal-
nole's notion had been over-estimated*
Then came the c r u c i a l »oint i n the
meeting - the debate on a motion from Mr.
John Cox, seconded by a Fred Snriggs.
tVas the college to r e - a f f i l i a t e to NU.S.?
After an hour of discussion i n Which no
r e a l case was put up against the motion
i t was defeated a f t e r a recount by 288
to 252 with 8 abstentions..
