The I.C. Challenge Cup goes each wear to the
costituent College which gains most points i n the
inter-College championships. Since the war, the
contest has been held eight times, and each time
i t has been won by the Mines beating the Guilds.
The boxing t h i s year was of a higher standard
than last years, and although arms drooped i n a
few cases towards the end of bouts, the boxers
were generally very f i t . This i s remarkable
considering the d i f f i c u l t i e s of t r a i n i n g with
only an apology f o r a gymnasium.
The outclassed boxers had t h e i r bouts stopped
i n the f i r s t rounds, but they a l l displayed
enthusiasm even i f the didn't know which foot
they should have forward.
The judges awarded Robin Appleby a tankard
as winner of the best bout of the evening when he
fought Baker i n the semi-final of the middle-
weight class.

first Tin's of both Bri3tol and 3Bathhampton.

ex-lst.-VHtman who are not devoting a l l their energies to
rowing this year, rowed a very good raoe with Heading 2nd.

Rugger Cup Semi - Final
I.C. l l p t s . : Wye College n i l .
I.C. reached the f i n a l of the U.L. Cup f o r the
fourth time i n f i v e years, a f t e r a very hard semi-
f i n a l game against Wye College. The score of 11-0
b e l i e s the dourness of the game, since i t was only
in the c l o s i n g stages that I.C. dominated the f i e l d .
Winning the toss, I.C. had f i r s t benefit of
a moderate wind at t h e i r backs, and started with a
period of mild pressure. From the early scrums I.C.
gained the b a l l more often than not, but the heel-
ing was slow, and the backs had l i t t l e opportunity
to show t h e i r speed. The Wye forwards were very
l i v e l y i n the loose and p e r s i s t e n t l y smothered the
I.C. halves before they could get the b a l l moving.
The scoring e f f o r t s i n the f i r s t h a l f were l i m i t e d
and consisted of a few long shots at goal from pen-
a l t i e s . Jones touched down by the post only to be
penalised f o r obstruction.
Kale went o f f 10 minutes before half-time,
with head i n j u r i e s , due i n part to the previous
evening's boxing, and did not return u n t i l just be-
fore the end of the game.
In the second half I.C., with t h e i r seven for-
wards, pressed hard, and went close to scoring more
than once. Eventually, a f t e r a period of strong
pressure, Hearn broke through on the b l i n d side to
i n i t i a t e a Fitzpatrick-Jones-Stone passing move-
ment which brought a hard-earned t r y .
Wye came back into the f i g h t , and one three-
quarter movement looked very dangerous but was suc-
c e s s f u l l y smothered. In the last ten minutes T.C.
were completely on top and scored two t r i e s , the
f i r s t by Hearn, who"went through from 35 yards and
brushed aside four or f i v e tackles before scoring
between the posts} he also converted. In the c l o s -
ing minutes Doncaster pounced on a loose b a l l i n
t y p i c a l s t y l e and scored.
I.C. won because t h e i r forwards were better
in the tight and olayed well i n the loose, i n the
second h a l f , and also because eventually the backs
got moving together. However, the team as a whole
i s very slow i n s t a r t i n g , and frequently the backs,
in t h e i r anxiety to get at t h e i r man, do not keep
a straight l i n e i n defence- which nay one day be
t h e i r undoing,
I.C. have reached the Final now, scoring 57
points i n three games and conceding none. The F i n a l
i s at Motspur Park on March 17th,, and our oppon-
ents are U.C.

HYDE PARK ROAD RELAY
On Saturday, Feb. 25th., due to a vast amount of work by
Chas, Cotterill, I.C. staged its biggest athletic event of the
je«X - the Road Relay in Hyde Park.
^for those who did not see the race we present an account
of I.C.'s progress through the six laps.
Mellor ran the first lag - always a nerve-racking task
and finished 13th. in the very good time of 14 min. 14 sees.
He handed over to Wall, whose light build and track training
enabled him to pull up to tenth place in 14 - 19.
The I.C. Captain, Ansell, ran the the third log. "fith
» recently o j i l e i tendon not quite healed, he managed to pull
up another place, and returned a time of 14 - 40. Collins, on
the fourth lap, gained another two places b;' his character-
istic speeding-up half way round, finishing 7th. i n 14 - 22.
Fain, an the fifth leg, lost no time in chasing the man i n
front, and turned i n 13 - 49, which put I.C. in 6th. position.
Cotterill, on the last leg valiantly tried to catch Heywood,
of Reading, but the gap was too jzreat. With his excellent time
of 13-22 (the fourth best of the day) I.C.'s total amounted
to 84-46, which gave us sixth position in a total field of
thirty.
