Reply to Erroneous Editing
To answer Mark's point (see page 4), the
reason letters are not edited is precisely
because we do not want to risk altering
the meaning. True, in many cases it is
obvious what the author intended, but
this is not always so. If we did 'correct'
letters it would be difficult to know when
to stop, especially when we honestly
arc unsure as to the nature of the point
being made. If it is an "obviously acci-
dental typographical" then the point is
unlikely to be obscured, and if the point
is obscured we may interpret it incor-
rectly. Hence we leave all letters well
alone (except, as Mark points out, for
shortening them). This policy extends to
all letters, whether or not I agree with
their contents.
Back to Comics
It seems that the general feeling among
you is that the now infamous comic
strips should remain absent from these
pages, fair enough - I'm a democratic
man, and am willing to put my hands up
in defeat on this one. I would just say
that discrimination and causing serious
offense were not my intentions. I hon-
estly believe that no one could take the
way women are portrayed in Felix 1122
seriously, as (I hope!) no man at this
college holds such a ridiculous attitude
towards the fairer sex. I know that sev-
eral women, including Ms Harries (see
page 4), found the cartoon inoffensive,
but obviously several more felt that they

were being discriminated against.
Hence I would like to apologise for any
damage done. Finally, I would just add
that it is often difficult to gauge the
views of nine thousand students and
staff, so please do write letters if you dis-
agree (or agree) with anything contro-
versial in Felix.
Can we Close This One Now?
I hope the string of letters on page 4 go
some way to resolving the Medics issue.
Certainly I have nothing more to say on
the subject itself, but I would point out
that you can expect Medics to be in Felix
news quite often. There are likely to be
problems with the merger and new BMS
building for some time yet, and we have
a duty to report such news. So please
don't take the article on this week's front
page as an attack on every Medic at IC.
In terms of non-Union news, the
medical campuses form a large and very
important part of IC's research facilities,
so it is hardly surprising that they are in
the news so often. Anyone who sub-
scribes to IC's daily news digest will know
that ICSM or its staff are mentioned in
the national press almost every day.
Is Homosexuality an Issue?
Apparently so. I think The Guardian
summed up the current debate quite
nicely last week by asking "What per-
centage of gays think it's moral to be a
politician?"
