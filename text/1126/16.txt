(Plastikman intcrtview continued)
Yes in a way, but not to an extreme.
I'm not going to get into a clown suit
tomorrow. Some people play tha part
more than others, but I am trying to get
a certain atmosphere across with Plas-
tikman. When you're trying to represent
that, there has to be some continuity.
Some people have thc approach that's
it all about the the music and that is
where my heart's at. But when you have
all these other things to play with it
becomes a creative process to me. It's
all tied in together. As I record a track or
compile an album, I'm already thinking
how it should look. As an artist who
works in the sound medium, that also
crosses over into other mediums. So it
is a whole package that I'm trying to rep-
resent, lhat package represents myself
so I'm very careful with that.
After you started making music
when did It become apparent that you
would start a label?
The first msuic I worked on became
the first Plus 8 release. When John and
I got into the studio together it was
really the first time that had ever been
in a studio. Before that a friend of mine,
Kenny Larkin and I were playing around
with keyboards, trying to get sounds
out of them with little or no success. But
when John and I got together and we'd
finished a number of productions we
thought 'we're going to go for this! let's
put it put and see what happens.' The
only kind of discussion we had was
what we were going to name the tracks
and name the record and what we were
going to call the record label. Not in the
way that we were going to start this big
record company but we just thought it
was important.
So as soon as we had the first
release out we said, 'that's cool! Wc
should do something else.' And Kenny
was sitting there so we said, 'Kenny.
John's got all this studio stuff. Let's get
in there and bang our heads together
and sec what happens.' Plus 8 number
two was a Kenny Larkin release. Then it
was, T ley Dan! What are you doing?' My
friend Dan Bell and I get together and
there's Plus 8 number three. By that
time it was a group of friends interact-
ing and making music. People started
sending us tapes. I don't know if we
were naive back then or what but I'm
glad it worked out for us because wc
just went with our feelings. I don't know
if it was timing ot if the planets were in
alignment but things worked out!
The tlectric Cafe has three copies of
the Plastikman album, Artifakts (Nova-
mute Records) to give away for free! Just
send an email to a.sethi@ic.ac.uk and tell
me where Richie Hawtin comes from
(town and country!). It's not as difficult
as it sounds! Good luck!
