Sailing
Having proved that wc were thc best of
the rest by winning the silver fleet trophy
at the six-pack the weekend before, it
was time to go and play with the big
boys (and girls) at the Student National
Sailing championships in Plymouth. With
the Met Office bringing out the special
top-draw big red arrows for thc week-
end's weather forecast, nerves were
frayed on the way down. Despite Late-
boy pulling both of his usual tricks, and
Verge-girl causing traffic chaos, we man-
aged to get to our Plymouth digs in
plenty oftime to get locked in the bar.
Nice.
Saturday dawned far too soon, but
nice and breezy. With a force 4-5 com-
ing in across the bay and the forecast
being for force 8 gusting 9 later in the
day our hosts decided to sail only one
fleet at a time, a good move consider-
ing the carnage that resulted form this
sort of weather last year. The Lark fleet
was out last, giving us plenty of time to
sort boats and drink tea. finally wc were
off in the early afternoon with Tony mut-
tering 'I'm not going home in a Ply-
mouth Ambulance'. Andy+Tony secured
themselves a good start position only to
be foiled by fickle fate as a mechanical
failure put them out before the gun
went. Chris*2 and Alex+Simon took up
thc challenge and stormed round virtu-
ally neck and neck, until the kites went
up and Chris*2 went swimming.
Alex+Simon decided to stay dry and
stormed round thc course to finish a
superb second, demonstrating to the
rest of the fleet behind them who did-
n't have the balls toget the kite up how
it should be done.
Sunday started sunny with the fore-
cast gales being replaced by a light
breeze. Tony was left high and dry for
the first race, as Andy couldn't be both-
ered to get out of Nicky's bed - and to
be frank who can blame him?
Simon+Alex mixed it up at the top of the
fleet again to prove that Saturday's result
was no fluke and Tim+Bean got a top
twenty finish that was cheekier than
most people realised. Race two and
Andy+Tony finally manage to storm over
the start line and lead for part of thc first
leg. The fleet catch-up during thc beat,
but Andy+Tony hold it together down
the run as Tim+Bean stomp over the
fleet and Simon+Alcx stealth their way
through to another good result. With
two boats finishing in the top ten IC
went into the final race with plenty to
play for. The heavily port biased start line
for the final race, coupled with the out-
going tide meant that most of the fleet
was over the line when the gun went.
Following the general recall IC mixed it
at thc top again, with Andy+Tony doing
well until they got trounced up the sec-
ond beat, Bean+Tim wishing they had a
thermos of tea with them and
Simon+Alex consolidating their position
near the top. Top ten finishes from
Bean+Tim plus Simon+Alex rounded off
thc days sailing nicely. Congratulations
to Simon+Alex who finished fourth over-
all in a fleet containing many world class
sailors and were the top University
owned boat, with only the spangly pri-
vateers boats ahead of them. Chris*2,
Andy+Tony and Tim+Bean all put in con-
sistently good results demonstrating the
depth of strength in thc IC Sailing Team.
Fellwanderers
Seventeen Fcllwanderers set off for the
Brecon Beacons on Friday evening,
undeterred by a dodgy van. The gearbox
was back-to-front, the handbrake was
on the right and it had all the accelera-
tion of an elderly hippopotamus on tran-
quiliscrs. The police were patrolling
Prince Consort Road in preparation for
the Remembrance Day festival, so we
parked the van outside the Union hop-
ing they would tow it away. But sadly
they ignored us, obviously on the
assumption that
anyone choos-
ing to drive
such a vehicle
must be too stu-
pid to pose a
threat to
national secu-
rity. So wc had
to drive thc
bloody thing all
the way to
South Wales.
We made it in
the end, and there was just time for a
cup of tea before bed.
There was no messing around on
Saturday. Everyone was up bright and
early, with much enthusiasm for a mon-
ster hike up Pen y fan and on to Fan y
Big (the name alone was enough incen-
tive for some of our more easily pleased
members). So we breakfasted quickly
â€¢ and were soon on our way up thc flank
of Pen y Fan. Morale remained high
despite steep climbs, howling gales and
relentless Fan y Big jokes, and we were
soon up high, admiring thc impressive
Ultimate Frisbee
No score given (IC lost)
On Sunday 8th the IC Ultimate Club
played its first ever game. For those of
you who are not already familiar with this
excellent sport, here is a quick explana-
tion: Like American Football crossed with
Netball, played with a plate-like plastic
disc most people would call a Frisbee.
Really you just chuck a Frisbee around
and do a lot of running.
We were playing away to the
Southampton Skunks, and the coach
was leaving at 10:00am. jon said 10:00,
I didn't know. At 8:00 my alarm went, so
I got up to turn it off and sat and played
Tekken for a while, Jon emerged from his
room, and we slowly got ready. Ket was
up too, 'cos he had a snooker match in
Southampton, it was a rare sight. At 8:41
Ket suggested I checked the departure
time, so I called Tom on his mobile.
"Aright" says me, '"Ello" say Tom. I check
the meeting time, "8:30. coach leaves at
9" says Tom, then "Where are ya?".
Jon and I ran to thc station, bought
tube tickets at 8:48, no train on the plat-
form. Shit. A short taxi ride later and we
were at the Victoria coach thing, sitting
in a coach with 15 other Frisbee chaps.
Two and a half hours later (or maybe
three, I dunno) wc arrived in Southamp-
ton, first stop was Burger King, where wc
fuelled up on burgers and shite food like
that (well, some of us did). Then it was
off to the Common for a bit of practise
before 'The Game'. The Common was-
n't such a definitive meet. We wandered
round it or an hour or so 'till we found
a couple of young people in stripy black
and white tops throwing a disc around.
""Ello, I'm Tom", "Aright, I'm Marvl".
Greeting over, we started limbering up.
Cos we had enough people -18 in
all after Al had arrived (he lives down
there and was home for the weekend)
- we split in to 2 teams of even skill, and
the Skunks did the same. Most of our
members are relative beginners, so we
were relieved to hear that they had loads
of new guys too. We were gonna play up
to 12 with half time when one team got
to 6. They had two pitches marked out,
so we got on with it, and had a laugh.
We scored some points (good!) and so
did they (not so good), and in the end
they just managed to beat both our
teams (but only by 1 and 2 points).
Then it was time for standing round
in a circle and having both captains say
a few words (some ritual type thing, or
so they said). Since we didn't have a cap-
tain (as such) I thanked them for the
games etc.
"To the pub!" they cried, and off we
went. An hour or so later we had to get
going, cos thc coach was returning, and
then we were heading back.
On the way back the main topic of
conversation (apart from how goddamn
good we were) was what the team
name should be. There were reserva-
tions about a preliminary name, which
had been chosen, so we wrote a few
new ones down, and laughed at Jon's
pathetic attempts (they were BAD!).

rounding panorama.
After lunch it was back down, out of
thc wind, for an epic stomp back to thc
hostel along winding country lanes. Dark-
ness fell, but a combination of flawless
mapreading and Rob's incandescent
new hairdo ensured that no-one got
lost. Our 21 miles were rewarded with a
huge chilli, our culinary expertise never
in doubt. This was duly washed down at
the local pub.
After the
previous day's
exertions, a
more moder-
ate walk was
called for, par-
ticularly by
our feet: we
settled for a
mere 10-mile
stroll. This was
at a lower
level, but took
in a wide vari-
ety of scenery. In the morning we fol-
lowed the path through the woods and
behind the roaring Sgwd yr Elra waterfall
(see picture) where Tim won the wet T-
shirt competition hands down. This was
followed by an afternoon excursion into
the Porth yt Ogof cave (which turned out
to be a very short excursion because
there was a huge river flowing through
it) and a squelch through a large bog to
get back to thc van.
This was a trip for any walker to be
proud of. It had everything: mountains,
forests, waterfalls caves, bogs and even
