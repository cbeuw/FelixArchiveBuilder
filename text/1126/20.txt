Aetna Golf 3
Gremlin
What is all this about releasing summer
games in the grip of winter lark about
eh? First Actua Tennis (which was actu-
ally very good) and now Actua Golf 3. It
must be a marketing scam that hopes
memories of warm afternoons will
encourage the product to shift from the
shelves, oh and of course the thousands
of Xmas gift's bought by Great Auntie
Eldrich.
Golf explained as simply as possible.
See white ball. See big stick. Stick hit ball.
See ball fly. Ball hit ground. See flag flut-
ter. See smaller stick. Stick hit ball (again).
See ball roll. See small hole. Ball in hole.
Now for those who have progressed
past the golf remedial class Actua Golf 3
offers both the traditional stroke play,
match play, foursome and fourball
games but for those wacky late night
golfers in a hurry there is clock golf (play
quickly or lose a stroke).
So what new features have Actua
included, a free pair of baggy plus-fours
or some rad baseball hat perhaps. Err,
well no not really. Apart from the Al
improvements and a new graphics
engine giving an increased frame rate of
20-25 frames per second (compared to
Actua Golf 2'S 12-16 fps), they have also
completely redone the control system.
Using the Dual Shock or Analog con-
trollers allows complete control of the
power, swing and the point of impact on
the ball. Perhaps it does take some time
to truly get used to the swing method
but after a while you too can be smack-
ing the ball into those sand pits of joy on
the edge of the green bits as efficiently
as the real world beginner. They have
also managed to lock up Peter Alliss and
Alex Hey in a recording studio and
refused to feed them cake until they
came up with some new comments -
luckily Amnesty became involved and
they are now both living out a new life
at the house of a Mr Kipling. Finally in the
true spirit of the new Actua range you
can customise your player in whatever
fashion crime you wish them to parade
about the course in.
So at the 19th green and looking
back on a particularly hard afternoons
golf it is possible to perhaps suggest it
is a golf game, and this is the problem.
Unlike the Actua Tennis game it really is
not going to convince the non-player to
look at it, which is a shame because like
most of the rest of the Actua range it is
a good sports simulation that plays and
holds the interest as well as it looks.
Golfers with PlayStations are going to
buy or more likely get it bought for them,
but if you are a non-golfer go and rent
it - it might not change your life but you
might find another sport simulation
worth a place in any collection.

Settling Down Nicely
Last Monday was the press launch of
Settlers III. For those who can not
remember the earlier releases it was
one of the better 'god Sims' that seemed
to rule the PC gamer world before the
first person shooter or the Command
and Conquer genres took over.
The sucesses of C&C and Warcraft
have obviously influenced them and
ongoing battles can now be directly con-
trolled rather than just waiting for a
group of soldiers to wander into enemy
territory and straight into a battle. The
graphics look superbly well detailed, it
will run on a Pentium 100 with no prob-
lems and with over 30 types of charac-
ters lo control. It also contains a tutorial
aimed to get you building you cmpicrs
as quickly as possible as well as the usual
lan and internet game options for you to
be a true imperialist.
if it plays as well as it looks it might
depose the current caesat of classical
based build plan and fighting games :
Age of Empires.
Pocket Fighter
Virgin Interactive
Beat-em-ups, we've had 2-D, 2.5-D, 3-D,
motion captured players, cartoon char-
acters, even dinosaurs, and now its time
to introduce the kids. Ok so its not orig-
inal, a long time ago a game called Vir-
tua Kids existed on the
long departed Sega Sat- •
urn and as that had
characters based upon
the Virtua lighter series.
This Playstation game
has its characters based
upon their Capcom rival
Street Fighter and Dark-
stalkers series. Using
the same 2-D stylised
cartoon appearance
seen in such titles as
Super Puzzle Fighter II
Turbo you get to control
little tyke versions of
Ken and among others, Felicia and a
young succubus, Morrigan - exceedingly
well developed for such a small child.
This Is basically a conversion of the
A'-rf >*• * '
arcade game of the same
name and as such seems
to hold the same appeal
and gameplay. they have
added some extra modes
to the Playstation version :
Training, Running battle
(sec how many opponents
you can knock out against
the clock), Free battle
(smack seven bells out of
a human without worrying
where the next 50p is com-
ing from), and a Edit mode
(where you choose your
players's moves, save them
to the memory card and
then take them round to a
friends for a virtual U-12
rumble).
The game's nice touches involve the
combo and the special moves where
the character will make an impromptu
costume and prop change and proceed
e •
to do damage in a unexpected way;
donkeys and footballs are involved -
though tony Adams is not credited with
an appearance. You also get to select
between fast and fran-

almost innocent ways.

And Finally
Just to show that we have interests other
than games, we will be covering next
weeks Digital Media World '98 expo at
the Wembley conference and exhibition
centre. It runs from tomorrow to Thurs-
day and will be covering a wide range of
topics from computer animation to web
design.
New for this year include the Digital
Video Pavilion displaying various non-
linear video editing packages, and a
Wired World section with seminars on
the future of web design.
