Win tickets to a top Premiership match
Q V R L I N G
F . A . P R E M I E R S H I P ,
Carling, sponsors of the FA Pre-
miership, are offering you the
chance to win a free trip to a top
match al our nearest top-flight
ground - which my GCSL Geography suggests would mean the
chance to see Chelsea in action for the expenditure
exactly nought pounds, nought pence. Pretty imprcs
sive, I think you'll agree?.
This competition is only a small part of a massive
give-away that those oh-so-generous people over at Car-
ling are running at student bars across the country. Buy
yourself a pint of Carling betwixt now and November 26 and you'll
recieve a scratchcard. Correctly answer the hideously easy question,
and you're in with a chance of winning a trip for two to a Scries A
game in Italy, copies of Premier League Manager 98, six months sub-
scription to Match of the Day magazine; or one of hundreds
of instant prizes.
To enter the competition simply answer the following
question:
How many seasons (including the current one) has
the FA Carling Premiership League been running?
Once you've thumbed through the Grandstand Book of Sport or
whatever reference bible happens to be lying around \our
flat/house/caravan, simply scribble down your answer, along wilh your
name and department, on a postcard, and drop it into the Felix office
by noon on Wednesday 18 November.
