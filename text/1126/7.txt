Medicine Matters
L
ast week I sat on the admissions
interview panel as the token stu-
dent and it was an enlightening
three hours.
Interviewing people is a lot harder
than it sounds-and this
may sound a very crass
and arrogant thing to
say - but I honestly went
into the room expect-
ing each case to be
clear cut in or out. I sup-
pose I had gone in with
the belief that every-
body who got to inter-
view would be a good
candidate and that the
interview was more of a
formality than anything
else. How wrong I was!
I have been through the admissions
process twice now, I have braved the
roller-coaster ride that is the six months
between sending off the UCAS form and
finally getting the grades that mean you
are now a student and I think I'm pretty
'I know that about
seventy five per-
cent of my first per
sonal statement
was truthful in fact
but not really truth-
ful in spirit.'
well up on all the rubbish
that people put in their per-
sonal statements to make
them look good. I know that about sev-
enty five percent of my first personal
statement was truthful
in fact but not really
truthful in spirit, frankly,
seeing the way that
some of the candidates
were judged, I am
afraid that thc registry
will send me a letter
saying that there was
some dreadful mistake
in my acceptance and
that I am not really
meant to be here at all.
My other great
nightmare came when
reading the second page of the UCAS
form under the academic achievement
section. I think that my generous helping
of GCSEs with plenty of 13s, the odd A to
show that I could read, write and do
Chemistry, thc solitary C to show that a
career in trance would be
Nick Newton a bad idea and a three As
at A level prediction (even
a suspect one) was perfectly adequate.
How wrong could I
have been. The first
half dozen candidates
clocked a C, a few Bs,
a comfortable number
of As, and about a mil-
lion A stars. How lucky
I was that these insid-
ious grades had not
been invented when I
did my GCSEs.
Finally, the straw
to break the proverbial
camel's back came
when I looked at thc
date of birth. These
people made me feel
really old. They are children of the eight-
ies - and fine, the cynics among you will
say that I was hardly in a position to
appreciate the seventies - but I was there
in body, even if it was only for a few years
"Anyway, the old
medical hands
among you will be
3lad ... to know that
am doing my best
to maintain the
intake standard of
students..."
and I wasn't really in any fit state to
appreciate what was going on.
Anyway, the old medical hands
among you will be glad (??) to know that
I am doing my best lo
maintain the intake
standard of students
that made Charing
Cross, Westminster
and St. Mary's great.
We can only hope that
in the cut-throat world
of league tables and
academic super-excel-
lence a few normal
people will be lucky
enough to make it
through the admis-
sions minefield; those;
who have enough left
of whatever it is that
makes a good medical student and a
good doctor; enough left to make it
through medical school. We can but
hope.

A
n issue that
inevitably
comes up
every year is
money and the lack of it.
With tuition fees and general
living prices rising in London
it would be a safe bet to say
that people will be desperate m 0 r

For some reason this doesn't .
seem to be the case though.
Every year Imperial College
receives about a third of a million
pounds from the government, which
goes into an access fund for UK stu-
dents, if it's not spent it goes straight
back, so it stands to reason that we
would want to give it to our students;
shouldn't be hard right? Wrong. To get
your hands on this all you have to do
is apply to it with some justification as
to why you need it - couldn't be sim-
pler. Last year 690 students received an
average of around £500 each from
this fund, but this year only 60 people
have applied. Does this worry me?
Well yes and no; its great that nobody
seems to need any financial support -
maybe everyone's ok - but I am wor-
ried that people arc out there who
desperately need this money just to
remain at University. Thc deadline for
autumn has already passed us, but
you can apply in
ICU President spring, if you
really need more
money just lo
j j | survive, please apply; to find
out more jusl ask in room
1 ol the Shcrfield building.
Still on thc issue of
/ money thc Dillons Hardship
f Book fund is a fund that
; nives students money to buy
u. in; • ili,-t ,»r esseiiiial ;o
iheir course, but they can't
afford to buy. All you have to do is fill
out an application form that you can
obtain from the Union Office and send
it off by thc 27th November, this may
seem like a waste of time, but thc
fund is worth £8000 and last year only
11 people applied; thc message is
they're gagging to give you money,
why not let them?
I'd just like to say thank's to every-
one for the feedback as to which stu-
dent discounts you want, keep them
coming. I'm on thc case of a few of
them already, but I'll give you a full
report of the results next week
(although I'm not lhat confident about
getting thc buy one get one free offer
with Aston Martin that someone asked
for; student hardship?)
