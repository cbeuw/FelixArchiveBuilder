NATIVE NATIONS: JOURNEYS IN AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY
Barbican Art Gallery
P
repare to be convinced - next
weekend, you're going to a pho-
tography exhibition. But first, it's
important to locate where this amazing
event is happening. Have you ever heard
of the Barbican Centre? Well, it's in that
huge labyrinth of a building. The collec-
tion is described as the "Native Nations"
of America. (Basically, pictures of Indians,
more pictures of Indians and guess what?
Even more Indians! Sounds boring, but
it really isn't.
Why should you bother?
As I browsed through the different
rooms, these pictures of people with
feathers in their hair and funny clothes
kind of appealed to me. Strange that, pic-
tures having an effect on me. After all,
I'm a typical male IC student interested
in playing Quake, hoping to have a girl-
friend before I reach 25 and dreaming of
going out with Lara Croft! So why did
these photos move me? I mean, they're
not even high-tech, mainly black and
white (even if the stereograph technique,
resulting in primitive 3D images, was
sometimes used), we're a long way from
computerised photos. So WHY then? The
whole idea of the exhibition is to show
how the "white settlers" colonised the
native Americans. The story starts in the
1880s and is told only by photographic
means. It's therefore very visual, so the
best way to see what I mean is to go
there... However, if I have not yet man-
aged to convince you, try to read the fol-
lowing paragraphs.
The Indians refused to be colonised
and "move out of the train's way", but
were incapable of stopping it. The result
was a systematic extermination of tribes
either by moving them or just by fighting
them. Peace treaties were signed but not
respected. A sentence that really shocked
me was "killing Indians is a pastime".
Poor Indians, they were happy hunting
and picking strawberries until the ugly
"white settlers" arrived to bother them. I
have to admit that I feel very strongly
against these bad guys. Even worse,
once defeated, the Indians were showed
to the world as circus attractions, espe-
cially in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.
They were not even considered as
humans but just as
"objects of desire".
Pictures of them on
postcards (nothing to
do with the ones you
find in phone boxes
though) and photo
albums flourished
everywhere. Nowa-
days, kids collect
football stickers not
Indian cards. Or am I
completely in
another world? The
exhibition has origi-
nal footage of the
Buffalo Bill Show on
TV and numerous
postcards on display.
This is where you
start feeling sympa-
thy for the natives,
since they were
unable to pick straw-
berries anymore!
Anyway, it was
thought back then that Indians would
soon be wiped off the face of the earth
(a bit like dolphins these days) and there-
fore some people decided to keep evi-
dence of their existence. This is what
Edward S Curtis did; he basically spent 30
years of his life photographing Indians.
This is where the exhibition gets really
interesting. This guy knew how lo take a
very scenic picture; some of his portraits
reminded me of Doisneaux's work - out-
standing! Often, it's the lighting that
makes a picture - he obviously knew
that. I also appreciated the medium he
used: albumen prints. It gives an orange
colour a bit like sepia toning. It's worth
going just for the Curtis shots. More-
over, if you have never seen a stereo-
graph or a photogravure before, maybe
you should also consider a trip to the Bar-
bican Art Centre.
In conclusion, this exhibition is
almost moving. The pictures are of good
quality, the subject is interesting and it
gives you an idea of Indian history and
what they've been through. From riding
in the open plains to being in a circus. All
you have to do is take the tube and then
follow the yellow line. Feel free to send
any feedback.

MY LIFE IN ART Etcetera Theatre
The plot of this play follows the tri-
als and tribulations (mainly the
latter) of a small theatre company
which is rehearsing for a stage adapta-
tion of Byron's Don Juan. When I realised
that the production followed the "play
within a play" format, I have to admit I
was very sceptical. I have always been of
the opinion that productions of this type
were overly clever and the parallels
between the characters and the charac-
ters that they play were contrived and
forced. As it happened, my thoughts
turned out to be a load of pretentious
kak and my scepticism was quashed
within a few minutes of the beginning.
The story is farcical and enjoyable.
The leading man begins to identify a lit-
tle too closely with his character (Don
Juan, the great and famous lover) for the
leading actress' liking. She has her own
ambitious ideas of seducing the director
but, alas, his plans in the seduction line
involve the leading man! A most enter-
taining love triangle - square even!
(Although the fourth corner always
remains hidden.)
The play throws many a different
theme to the fore:
young love, old love,
gay love, love vs lust,
staying with your
partner only through
the fear of being
alone and our starry-
eyed perception of
those we love com-
pared to the real
"them". I suppose
that the common
ground on which all
these subjects grow
is the incompatibility
of us all and the confusion, passion, mis-
ery and hilarity which often ensues.
Damn, I have just made this pro-
duction appear heavy and a drag to
watch - totally unjust. Let me throw in
some more suitable adjectives,- sharp,
witty, cutting, pacey, clever (very clever),
slick, modern and oh so, so funny. Yep,
all of these descriptions apply.
m % g . This is my
favourite type of
theatre - exploring
its real and deep
topics fully and intel-
ligently. No glibness,
no piety, no easy
answers and still the
complex plot was
conveyed deftly and
lightly, the play is
not overly "arty" -
like so many on the
fringe, yet it is not
without substance -
like so many in the West End. A very
entertaining balance that made me
laugh.
There are no breathtaking emotional
performances; the play does not require
them. I he acting at times was hugely
natural and at other times very Brechtian.
The stylised sections fit in well and arc
just as funny, particularly the three-way
phone calls. The use of the original
poetry from Don Juan seemed to me,
bearing in mind I had no knowledge of
it before this play, to be well chosen
and it was certainly moving.
The theatre is situated above a busy
pub, ihe Oxford Arms. Camden is the
coolest place to spend an evening, so it's
well worth a fiver.
