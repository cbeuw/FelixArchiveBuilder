Cook cops out at last minute
IC Union is slill left without a Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies) due to the
withdrawal of the only candidate, Stuart
Cook, only an hour before the close of
voting on Tuesday.
In his letter to the Union, he
described his reasons as "numerous",
but named the refusal of the Executive
Committee of ICU to change his contract
as a major one. He had asked Exec to
allow him Wednesday afternoons free to
continue playing football for an ICU
team. Mr Cook, a materials science stu-
dent, took this as a vote of no confidence
in him personally, stating that "I feel that
I could not undertake such an important
position if I do not have the support of
elthermy colleagues or my prospective
employers."
Mr Cook claimed that the change
would not have meant that he worked
fewer hours, just different ones. How-
ever, according to one member of the
Executive Committee, they refused his
request on the grounds that "it would set
a dangerous precedent... if ICU is to be
By Andrew Brown
seen as a profes-
sional organisa-
tion then its staff
must accept pro-
fessional stan-
dards".
Mr Cook's
success in the
election was by
no means cer-
tain. Following a
tough examina-
tion at St Mary's
on Wednesday 4
november {Felix
1125), where
amongst other
things he con-
fessed that he
had decided to Stuart Cook before his
run because he was "a bit bored" , a
'New Election' victory seemed likely.
However, David Hellard, ICU President,
stressed that
there should be
no speculation
about the possi-
ble outcome as
no counting took
place: all of the
ballot papers
were destroyed
immediately.
Among the
consequences of
Mr Cook's late
withdrawal from
the election is a
not insignificant
financial loss. His
decision to stand
down in effect
demise Photo: Joel a f t e r t h c d e c .
tions had been run has cost the Union
an estimated Â£600 for the hire of ballot
boxes, manning polling stations and
transport etc).
With thc sabbatical post still open,
the elections process will be forced to run
its course once again. Nominations for
the position will be re-opened today,
and will remain open for two weeks. If
a fully seconded candidate has been
found by this date, then campaigning
can begin, and another election will take
place shortly before Christmas. Conse-
quently any successful candidate would
assume the post at the end of this term
- hardly a convenient time for most
undergraduates, who would be put out
of sync with the academic year.
As a result, David Hellard is "not opti-
mistic" that a DP(C&S) will be found for
this year. If that is the case, then thc
duties of DP(C&S) arc likely to be split
between Messrs Hellard and Ince,
adding to their already heavy workload.
Thc ICU President regretted that the
Union had lost "a lot of time and effort
- time and effort that could have been
spent on more productive challenges.
But at least he had a go."
Medics reel from resignations
The chaos that has hit the Constituent
College Unions this year would seem to
be spreading, with the resignation of
one of the IC School of Medicine Union
(ICSMSU) Vice Presidents leaving seri-
ous questions hanging over the Union.
The resignation of Seif Ahmad, the
ICSMSU Vice-President (Internal) at Char-
ing Cross, comes on top of Andy Hceps'
decision to stand down as ICSMSU Sec-
retary two weeks ago and continuing
suggestions of unhappiness amongst
members of the Medical School Execu-
tive. Various reasons for the two resig-
nations have been put forward by senior
sources, but thc common thread of prob-
lems caused by the on-going merger
between Charing Cross and St Mary's
runs through them all.
Wade Gayed, the ICSMSU President,
accepted this problem "Last year there
was a sabb at each site, and the students
were used to a large union all under one
roof. Now we're spread across three
campuses". This, he said, had led to a
level of apathy amongst Charing Cross
By David Roberts
students that had been seen as unac-
ceptable by certain elements who had
"used it as cannon fodder against Seif".
Consequently, Mr Gaycd felt that hehad
been forced out by certain elements at
Charing Cross - both students and staff.
However, a more worrying side
effect of the pressures created by the
merger has been a growing personal
animosity that has developed amongst
various senior members of the Med
School Exec. IC Union President David
Hellard explained that "tensions were
running high, causing splits to occur",
and Mr Gayed backed up this opinion,
noting that "members of the Union def-
initely weren't happy with each other...
for the last few weeks our Exec meetings
have just been slagging matches". It is
these divisions which have been
rumoured to be the real cause behind Mr
Ahmad's resignation. Indeed, Mr Gayed
went on to say that "the pressure was far
more than we imagined when we took
the job on ... I've thought about resign-
ing several times".
Certainly Mr Heeps' resignation was
related to the problems faced by the
Union, with Mr Gayed accepting that
the cause of thc resignation was that
"Andy didn't want to be a part of a Union
that was failing". Whilst he accepted that
this was true two weeks ago, he added
that thanks to the work done in the inter-
vening time "the Union is finally getting
its act together, so stay tuned".
