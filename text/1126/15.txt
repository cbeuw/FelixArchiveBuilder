3.1 .1998/Humate(Platlpus)
Another slunning slice of quality
trance from the Platlpus stable. The
main track here is John Digweed's
Bedrock mix - this one's been caned
to death by the likes of Sonique and
the big man from Hastings, so It
must have something to il. Ihe CD's
got seven mixes on it. .Most are the
standard trance remixes, but some
of them also have a chilled-out,
ambieni edge to them. Probably
worth finding some of these on 12".
Best Mix = 3.2 Bedrock Mix

Yet another collection of their
releases and yet another success I
trance are represented as ever.
From tweekin' acid trance through
to tracks with large fade outs and
dreamy orchestral moments, it is a
get a little repetitive at times, but
after all, Platlpus is a label with a
very distinctive sound, and that Is
reflected in this compilation. Repe
Hon is also not always a bad thing
thoy have been so successful lor so
long There are no fillers here. Lach
track can stand on its own and
singles on the label. And any album
that includes Madagascar by Art of
I ranee is on to a winner. This is slm
ply one of the best dance 12" to
an: here, like Art of Trance, Quiet-
cord.
