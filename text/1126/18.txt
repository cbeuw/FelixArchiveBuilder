Snake Eyes * * * V 2
Starring : Nicholas Cage, Gary Sinise
Director: Brian de Palma
Y
ou would expect something a little
bit special from the director of
such cinematic wonders as Carrie,
Carlito's Way, The Untouchables and
Mission Impossible, and that is exactly
what you get with Snake Eyes.
The seedy gambling world of Atlantic
City provides the backdrop for this tense
thriller in which a cop gets unwittingly
caught up in a story of military conspir-
acy, murder and deception, when all he
wants to do is enjoy his front row seat for
fight night. Cage, as in the wonderful
Face/Off, is a cop, only this time he Is sev-
etal summits short of the moral high
ground and is in fact more bent than a
pre-EU banana. Everybody loves a rogue
though, and this only adds to his charm.
This latest offering from de Palma
diverges slightly from his tried-and-tested
style of visually graphic blood, gore and
mutilation, whilst still retaining the ten-
sion of his earlier work. The cinematog-
raphy is brilliant, as ever. This is especially
so in some of the flashback scenes,
where the audience is mentally displaced
into eyes other than those of the main
character - an original and unusual expe-
rience, only made possible by the robust
Nic Cage. With a gun. Lying on the ground. How original.
plot. This type of audience translocation
is not a new approach for de Palma,
however unlike the 'saying one thing,
thinking another' scenes of Mission
Impossible, this time it actually works!
Cage performs well, and his emo-
tional torment is believable, although
the part is not as demanding as Face/Off
and it seems as though he is not pushed
to his limits. With great support from
Sinise and Stan Shaw who plays the
boxer (who's only fault is a slight lack of
emotion when beating the hell out of a
defenceless man), the plot is held
together well. However, there is defi-
nitely something missing from this film,
but assuming you are reading this to
decide whether or not to go and see the
film, it is very difficult to tell you what that
missing factor is without spoiling the
film for you. Let me just say that the
casting of one of the main characters
could be a little less Siniseter. B

ith comedy horror all the rage
in Hollywood, cheesy vampire
flicks couldn't be far behind.
Consequently, Blade is offered up to
the great cinema-going public.
Wesley Snipes stars as the epony-
mous hero, half-man half-vampire, and
sworn to the complete destruction of
Transylvania's finest. Thus, he dons a
huge layer of body-armour, grabs some
comedy weapons and sets out into the
night....

Henry Fool

Starring: James Urbaniak,

Director: Hal Hartley

espite a relatively successful
carreer that has spanned more
than fourteen years, you proba-
bly haven't heard of writer/director I lal
I lartley. Although films like Amateur,
Flirt and The Unbelievable Truth won
him critical acclaim on the arts circuit
and in underground circles, his films
are a million miles away from typical
box office fodder. Likewise his latest
film, Henry Fool, is hardly representa-
tive of modern mainstream US film-
making.
The film centres on examining
about how a seemingly 'common man'
can possess unexploited talent while
another can delude himself of possess-
ing it. The story is about a binman,
Simon Grim, who lives a rather depress-
ing life with his mother and over-sexed
sister.
Along comes Henry Fool to live in
their basement. Loud, chain-smoking,
beer-guzzling, a colossal egomaniac
and self-styled intellectual, I lenry foo!
believes he will blow a big, wide hole in
the literary establishment with his 'Con-
fession' opus - only he hasn't finished it
yet. I le takes Simon under his wing and
inspires him to begin writing. Pretty
soon Simon, the binman, finishes what
is at first a badly-spelt and slightly mud-
dled book-length poem. I lenry teaches
Simon how to polish it and the plot
unfolds to some unexpected surprises
at the end, with occasional spots of
comedy and some interesting sexual
tension.
Hal Elartley made his reputation with
a string of independent productions
that generally carry intelligent observa-
tions on life, wild humour, and engag-
ing analyses of human behaviour. This
film is no exception, I liked it and
enjoyed the observations and analyses.
I also liked I lartley's proactive stand;
though he doesn't issue judgement on
his characters, he lets them see truths
about themselves. My only complaint
about the film is its length - clocking in
at 2 hrs 20 mins it feels dead slow at
times. D
