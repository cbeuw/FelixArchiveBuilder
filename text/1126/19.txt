Aliens really have had some really bad
press at the moment. When they're not
installing anal probes into cartoon char-
acters or popping down the universe
for a late night snack they're infecting the
world with deadly red viruses and per-
forming major
architectural
changes to major
cities.
This game is
no exception with
some dirty, low
down aliens hav-
ing invaded the
city of Arcadia and
generally gone about clearing the rabble
of humans in a way that certain Balkan
leaders would feel was truly justified.
This time thc UN have sat this one out
and instead you get heaviiy armoured
troopers - Mr Washington or Ms Doyle,
who arc perfectly capable of dealing
with this sort of thing themselves.
Dropped into the city it is their job to
hunt down any alien transport by run-
ning, jumping, picking up powerups and
mowing down any aliens with the
impressive amount of firepower at your
disposal.

The Unholy war
Eidos • • • •
Yes it's thc return of the 3rd person
shoot-em-up usually well done by the
arcades but poorly executed on the con-
soles. Forget strategy, the aim of this
game is to keep the gun red hot and
Alien blood flowing. The graphics and
the lighting effects set the scene as the
rollercoaster of destruction flows from
explosion to explosion. The arcade
flavour is strengthened as the rumble
effects from the Dual Shock gamepad
add to the experience. If Sony did want
a game to show the playstation as an
arcade emulator this would make it into
the top 5. An excellent blast and kill
game that you might well find difficult to
stop playing.

Kelly Doyle and Reno Washington take
time out to admire their new 80's style
shoulderpad set.
News
Michael Owen in Bed
with Lara.
Now thc World Cup is a distant memory
of dissapointmcnt, it's time for the usual
seasonal releases to surface above the
dug out. Not the first out but closely
shadowing ISS is Eidos Interactive's little
Michael Owen's World League Soccer
'99. They have motion captured the lithe
line runner to give genuine Michael
Owen action. Peter Brackley and Ray
Wilkins are the other big names pulled
in to hurl abuse whenever the ball diss-
apears into row Q. Kick off is on the 20th
November at the usual PC and Playsta-
tion grounds throughout the country.
We will be running a competition for a
lucky Playstation owner to get a free
copy later this month.
Park Life :
PC Screensaver Alert
South Park is officially big. It's bigger
than Cartman on bulking agent. Now
those nice people from Telstar are about
to release a plague of epidemic propor-
tions with the forthcoming release of the
South Patk PC theme and Screensaver.
This handy little package also con-
tains a calendar allowing you to have a
character of the day, as well as providing
icons and wallpapers from South Park
scenes. So after Xmas expect PC's
thoughout the world to echo to the cries
of "Kick Ass", "Ftowdcc Ho 1
" and "Oh my
God I They've killed Kenny". It's due out
on the 13th of November - remember
1.5 million viewers a week on Channel
4 can't be wrong !
Is it a beat-em-up? Is it a
strategy game? Is it a
role playing game? Well,
yes, it is all three and its
pretty good at most of
them too. Once again
alien invasion is the
cause of it all as the
ceasefire between the
native Arcanes and the
newcomer Tecknos has
broken and all that is left
is for one race to drive
thc other into oblivion.
All that you have to do is
choose whether you
want to do so in a sim-
ple arena driven beat-
em-up, or prolong the
anticipation by playing a strategy game
based on a 3-D map, moving your char-
acters and fighting it out when you meet
the enemy on the same grid tile.
As a beat-em-up it doesn't really
match the aggression of say the Tekken
release as close in combat can generally
be avoided. This is where a bit of the
strategy element seeps into the straight
fight as each of thc characters have their
own specialities. Some of them were
never built for the rough and tumble of
bar fighting and prefer throwing items
and running. These little cowards can get
really annoying when your opponent
realises that your rhino is little quicker
than a C5 at full speed. Choose wisely,
corner the buggers and they will soon
stop their anti-social ways. The animation
should you get close in though is as
sharp as a pair of speeding shears
though silk, with thc camera managing
to capture most of it without zipping
about too much.
As a strategy cum role playing game
it once again loses out against some of
the more specialist games. It is not chess
and does not have the sophistication
and range of moves of similar strategy
games. It is really a modern, well exe-
cuted and animated 3-D version of thc
classic 1980's 2-D strategy game Archon.
Instead of the Dark and fight you have
two tribes, but both allow the characters
to cast spells between turns and fight
over the grid tiles.
If you do fancy some-
thing to engage both
your primal and intclcc-
tual parts this could be it.
five minutes to spare and
you can practice your spe-
cial moves. Got an hour
or two to spare and you
can pretend you are
being intelcctual while
spilling blood in thc
arena. It is effectively two
above average games for
the price of one.
GS
Harvest for the World
Gremlin's time traveling alien
shooter Body harvest has finally been
released. Your genetically enhanced
hero has to battle through five different
levels of alien incursion in order to pre-
vent the human race from meeting a
messy end as a scries of late night take-
aways.
Choose to run about the level or if
you can't be bothered to run about like
a headless chicken you can take vehicles
without consent and drive about the
uncongestcd streets. Progress to thc
next level by saving locals and blowing
up the shield generators, and allowing
the rest of the world to become involved
in the fight - The aliens arc basically
southern universe shandy drinkers.
Talking to some of the locals will
also be useful as they provide hints and
and tell you where the super hidden
special weapons are kept. Use these
and you can go on killing aliens in drive
by shootings. It looks good and popped
into exislance at all time consistant soft-
ware shops last Friday.
