EDUCATION CUTS
by Nick Morton, ICU President
The cuts! You've read about them in newspapers, seen
information about them on T V , now here is a summary in
FELIX. I am sorry this article is long, but please read it.
This article is about the cuts in student numbers and
money made to individual universities by the University
Grants Commission (UGC). Here goes
O v e r the next three or four years
there is to be a cut in home and
E E C student numbers of over 4%.
There has also abeen a financial
cut averaging roughly 17% over
the next three years, part of this
cut being due to the removal of
the subsidy on overseas students.
The U G C has been selective
and has not applied cuts on a
pro-rata basis. This means that
some universities have escaped
very lightly, (e.g. Oxford and
Cambridge, make of that what
y o u w i l l ! ) a n d o t h e r s h a v e
become famous for really suffer-
ing the axe. These are Aston,
Bradford. H u l l , Keele, Salford
and Stirling. These universities
have had severe reductions in
b o t h s t u d e n t n u m b e r s a n d
grants.
The effect of the drop in places
a v a i l a b l e has m e a n t many-
students w h o p r e v i o u s l y m a y
have got to university through
U C C A ' s clearing system will be
u n s u c c e s s f u l t h i s y e a r . A l s o
universities have been strict on
exactly meeting A Level entrance
requirements, e.g. if asked lor
C C C , A A D may not be accepted.
T h e u n s u c c e s s f u l u n i v e r s i t y
candidates may become unem-
ployed or apply to Polytechnics
and Colleges of Further E d u c a -
tion. Regretably these institu-
tions are also under scrutiny and
c e r t a i n l y not e x p a n d i n g , so
someone somewhere will lose out
altogether on a place in Higher
Education. A l l this is happening
when the demand for plates is
increasing.
The effects of the financial cuts
have been severe economies in
many universities, frantic efforts
lo raise money from alternative
sources and to "light the cuts".
Closure of whole departments
and even the possibility ol whole
universities going bankrupt have
been on everybody's mind.
In all the letters sent to the
universities, the U G C "advised'"
on how individual subject areas
were to be increased, left alone,
r a t i o n a l i s e d o r c o m p l e t e l y
withdrawn. This has meant the
committee were selective both
in terms of institutions affected
and where they felt the cutbacks
should occur within them.
Quite how the selectivity of the
cuts was calculated is still not
clear, despite the availability of
evidence presented to a C o m -
mons Select Committee by the
U G C . They collected a limited
a m o u n t of i n f o r m a t i o n f r o m
various bodies including industry
(as p o t e n t i a l e m p l o y e r s ) , the
universities a n d the research
councils. The U G C may also
have used data collected in its
own surveys but some of the
d e p a r t m e n t s s u g g e s t e d l o r
rationalisation or closure have-
not been visited by the U G C for
over a decade.
London University
L o n d o n has been cut in terms ol
both numbers and grant in line
w i t h the n a t i o n a l a v e r a g e .
L o n d o n University, as a whole,
.receives a block grant from the
U G C . T h e U n i v e r s i t y C o u r t
then distributes this money as it
sees lit amongst the schools and
i n s t i t u t e s except for I m p e r i a l
College. This is important; this
year, as in all previous years, part
of the grant given to London
University is actually earmarked
lor Imperial College. The Court
has made its grant allocations,
effectively acting as a m i n i - U G C
to the colleges. As yet, I am
u n s u r e w h o t h e l o s e r s a r e
a m o n g s t the o t h e r L o n d o n
colleges, but like the U G C , the
Court has been selective. As well
as distributing the money, the
Court has also given provisional
indication ol student numbers to
be met by each of the University's
institutions by 1983/4.
Imperial College
IC will actually have an increase
i n h o m e a n d E E C s t u d e n t
numbers. We are to get an extra
one hundred and seventy students
by 1983/4. Fifty of these are
i m m e d i a t e l y a b s o r b e d b y
Greece's e n t r y into the E E C
m o v i n g s t u d e n t s out ol the
overseas into the home category.
That still means we are to gain
forty home and E E C students per
annum over the next three years.
The College has roughly followed
the U G C ' s advice in terms of
w h i c h d e p a r t m e n t s the e x t r a
students will go (o.
Financially the College has
been cut 14.8% in real terms over
the next three years. At current
levels this means a cut ol //1.3m
for 1981 '2 a n d / / 0 . 9 m a n d
/'O.bbm in the following years.
This is slightly better than the
national average but is still a lot
of money. Substantial economy
measures are necessary.
U G C money represents about
hall the College income. The
remainder comes from fees (paid
bv Local Education Authorities
for home students) a n d from
outside earnings.
Home and E E C lee income
will remain steady but income
f r o m overseas s t u d e n t s w i l l
probably drop as their numbers
fall, this decrease being due to
t h e g o v e r n m e n t ' s p o l i c y o f
charging " l u l l cost fees". The
R e c t o r a n d the C o l l e g e arc-
looking to boost outside earnings
by c a n v a s s i n g i n d u s t r y l o r
s u p p o r t a n d by s e t t i n g u p
interdepartmental sections.
The Economies
This is where the effects of the
cuts are felt by students. First let
me say that the student union
should not have a great deal of
trouble running on their budget
for 1981 2 but could have more
difficulties in successive years as
the cuts bite. Other non-academic
areas have been cut bark. e.g. the
r e f e c t o r y a c c o u n t must b e a r
more of its own overheads and
telephone calls between 9:00am
and 1:00pm have been restricted.
The departments have been
put on a shoestring s u r v i v a l
budget. This will undoubtedly
affect t e a c h i n g a n d research.
Undergraduates may lind them-
selves doing less practical work or
d o i n g less r e f i n e d , c h e a p e r
practical work. Both undergrads
and postgrads will probably be
using cheaper or dated equip-
ment. It is for these reasons that I
believe you should all be sitting
up and taking note of this whole
situation, (though if you've read
this far you are probably interes-
ted anyway).
T h e m a j o r e x p e n d i t u r e i n
College is in salaries and wages.
T h i s has meant a t e m p o r a r y
freeze on stall recruitment and
lor the next three years a close
scrutiny will be kept on replacing
people who retire or move on. It
is h o p e d that about h a l l the
people leaving over this period
w ill not be replaced. The effect of
this is that a number of people
are going to have to work harder
to cover the unfilled posts. This
may well not be a bad thing in
many cases but again it could
affect students. There could be a
decrease in technician support as
they cover elsewhere or adminis-
trative matters may take longer.
There are many more possible
effects and I'll let you think about
them for yourselves.
W h e n discussing wage savings
I have assumed people will leave
by natural wastage. The College
believe natural wastage will be
sufficient over the next year if the
trade unions co-operate. H o w -
ever, they are not willing to rule
out the possibility of redundan-
cies over the following two years.
The C a m p a i g n
Universities, trade unions and
student unions up and down the
country have been very quick to
react to the cuts. In many places
a l l people i n v o l v e d have got
together to form joint campaign-
ing bodies. Salford has attracted
a lot of support and revenue Irom
industry. Perhaps this is just what
the U G C was aiming lor. In
other universities the campaign
has been thought about and not
launched so rapidly in the belief
that there is not point campaign-
ing over the summer when M P s
and academies alike are sunning
themselves on the Costa del Sol.
In all places the campaign must
take the form of lobbying M P s ,
other influential people and ol
course parents. Parents of school
c h i l d r e n are i m p o r t a n t votes
â€¢ when it comes to an election;
their belief is that they must be
shown that their children now
h a v e s i g n i f i c a n t l y d e c r e a s e d
o p p o r t u n i t i e s l o r a t t e n d i n g
universities.
Opinions
I don't think the U G C should be
taking the blame for making the
cuts as these were toned upon
them by the government. H o w -
ever, the government have shown
some f l e x i b i l i t y to p r e s s u r e
already. D r Rhodes Boyson (ex-
J u n i o r M i n i s t e r l o r H i g h e r
Education) has recently said that
the student totals given by the
U G C w e r e i n d i c a t i o n s , not
instructions. This is certainly a
very different interpretation from
the way everybody read it back
in July. I believe the principle ol
education cuts imposed by this
government is wrong and short-
sighted. I feel the same way
about the imposition of "full cost
fees" lor overseas students. I
further believe students in this
country should be telling the
g o v e r n m e n t they have got it
wrong but they must do this
without further tarnishing the
poor reputation students have.
Without some reaction we may-
experience further cutbacks.
We could argue for evermore
about where the U G C should
have made their cuts. Undoubt-
edly they should have collected
more data but they were pushed
into this situation rather rapidly.
A great deal of publicity has
surrounded the fact that the axe
fell h e a v i l y on " t e c h n o l o g i c a l
universities" like Bradford and
Sallord and it seems the U G C
were trying to I r i m down fringe
a c t i v i t i e s to the m a i n s t r e a m
t e c h n o l o g i c a l d e p a r t m e n t s at
these places. It should also be
remembered that many other
u n i v e r i s i t i e s s p e c i a l i s i n g i n
science a n d e n g i n e e r i n g have
escaped lightly, e.g. Cambridge,
Bath, and in terms of student
n u m b e r s . I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e .
H a v i n g said all that I do believe
the U G C should have thought
m u c h h a r d e r b e f o r e h i t t i n g
technology which is surely the
future of this country.
