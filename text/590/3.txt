EXEC VIEWS
Welcome! And welcome back! Those of you who are new will
rapidly gain the impression that the Union and its facilities are
completely shambolic. However, the old lags may notice one
or two changes for the better (that is if they have learnt to
keep their eyes open since we last saw them).
You can now buy extremely cheap, quality sports gear. This
can be found in the recently expanded Southside Shop. It is on
sale alongside regalia (scarves, ties, slopshirts, etc) and the
traditional range of groceries. We believe this is a valuable
addition to the Union's services.
The Lower Lounge in the Union Building has had a facelift.
From now on, not only will you be sitting in pleasant
surroundings but also you will be offered a variety of real ales.
The bars are offering discounts on some beers this month
(see ad in this FELIX). We hope you are taking advantage of
this, we certainly are!
This week sees the first Union General Meeting (UGM) of
the session. It will take place at 1:00pm on Thursday,
October 8, in the Great Hall. Read Exec News to find out what
is going on then come and see it all happen for real.
And finally we must remind you that tonight marks the birth
of a new tradition. The combined skills of the entire ICU
Executive bring you the New Year's Party.
