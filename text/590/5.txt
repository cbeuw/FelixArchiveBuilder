AND THE
24-HOUR
CASH TILLTO
PAY FOR
THEM.
To pay for most 24-hour services
you need 24-hour cash. The NatWest
SERVICETILL provides exactly that.
It's called a SERVICETILL because
it not only offers you cash, itwill, ifyou
wish, send an up-to-date statement of
your account or a new chequebook.
During the working day y o u can
even get a check on your balance on
the spot.
Why don't y o u ask for details at
your nearest NatWest branch?
The NatWest SERVICETILL. You can
make itwork all hours for your money.
