CLUBS AND SOCIETIES
Islamic
The Islamic Society caters for daily prayers,
Friday prayers and other general requirements
for Muslims; it also invites everyone to come
and find ouk for himself about Islam.
This year we managed to acquire a room for
our activities through the tireless effort and
dedication of the members. A s such we would
like to see all our members, together with all
the Muslims at College, making use of the
facilities provided.
The society's activities are published by IC
Diary and for any other information, come and
meet us at the Freshers' Fair. We organise
Arabic classes for beginners and intermediates.
O n M o n d a y s d i s c u s s i o n groups are held
during lunchtime at our room in 9 Princes
Gardens (basement) at 1:00pm.
Ents
W e l c o m e to Impcol etc, just a reminder
for you to pop in and see us all at the Freshers'
Fair (the room with the imaginative colour
scheme) and we'll give you more information
about us.
O u r film list is included somewhere in this
F E L I X . O u r films are shown in M e c h Eng 220
(ask anyone for directions). O n Thursday
nights from 6:30pm onwards (come along to
help at 6:00pm).
The Freshers' Concert is on October 14 in
the Great Hall. A l l the bands are new and
interesting. Weapon of Peace are a really fab
It always strikes me as a bit odd that many
people whose working life consists largely of
abstract reasoning will happily indulge in still
more cerebral callisthenics during their leisure
time. Nevertheless it is for these perverse
individuals (among whom, of course, I count
myself) that I write what has become one of
the most popular regular columns in F E L I X .
(Modesty never was my greatest virtue...).
Twelve months of composing puzzles have
provoked a number of people to ask me how
(or even whether) this column is organised and
I felt that while introducing myself to freshers
and welcoming them, I would also take the
opportunity to reply.
Perhaps the most common question I am
asked concerns the number of students who
solve the puzzle each week. The number of
solutions I receive varies from none at all to
thirty or so, with ten being about typical.
Consequently, if you enter regularly, you are
almost certain to win a prize at least once a
term. But many people never bother to send
me their solution. I am constantly amazed by
the number of people who come up to me (I
speak of those who have penetrated my cloak
of pseudonymity) and tell me that they often
s o l v e the p u z z l e s but n e v e r e n t e r the
competition. N o w I realize IC has a reputation
for apathy to maintain, but the number of
students who can afford to turn down a fiver,
having done the work for it, can surely be
counted on the fingers of one foot.
The other topic I am quizzed on is the
source of my puzzles. Well, in the words of
Isaac Asimov: "I make 'em up, see!" Some are
pure invention, others are based on ideas
w h i c h c o m e up in o b s c u r e m a t h e m a t i c a l
textbooks, discussion with friends, or even
(heaven forbid) my work. Since I am not a
reggae band; the Flying Padovanis are the
shadows of the eighties; and, Everest the
Hardway are a hardworking bunch who have
been seen and enjoyed by nearly everyone in
Ents.
Our Disco will be hitting the road soon, so
any budding D J s out there can come along
and have a bash. Incidentally, the Disco can be
hired (with lights) on the cheap. Come to the
Ents Room or phone 589-8238.
If you don't get a chance to come in at the
F r e s h e r s ' F a i r , we meet e v e r y M o n d a y
lunchtime, feel free to come in and insult the
executive (God knows they need insulting!).
Chemical
The Chemical Society (Chem Soc) exists to
promote an interest in chemistry by organising
a programme of lectures and social events.
The lecture topics tend to be very wide ranging
and last year included lectures on 'Chemistry
in Cooking' and 'Forensic Science' lectures
planned for this year include 'The Chemistry
and P h y s i c s of C i g a r e t t e S m o k i n g ' a n d
'Chemistry and Plants'. O u r activities are
aimed mainly at chemists, but if you're not a
chemist and would like to come along we'll be
very pleased to see you.
Our first lecture this term is on 8 October
and is entitled 'Wines of the World' by S Ayers
(from S t o w e l l s of Chelsea) followed by a
cheese and wine party.
Other lectures this term will be publicised in
F E L I X a n d on the c h e m i s t r y d e p a r t m e n t
noticeboards. So hope to see you there or at
Freshers' Fair.
world-class chess player, I rely on my friend
Grey Spider (who is!) to provide me with
bizarre and ingenious chess puzzles. A n d just
occasionally, when I'm particularly pressed for
time, I will adapt and disguise a puzzle from
another setter, the New Scientist being my
favourite source. (And if anyone thinks such
cribbing is parasitic, I would encourage them
to study my column in F E L I X of October 10th,
1980 and compare it with the New Scientist of
April 2nd, 1981!)
I also invite friends and regular solvers to
compose puzzles too, so if any of you want to
set a puzzle, I'll be happy to consider anything
you have to offer.
I take great personal pride in the appearance
and layout of the column, doing all my own
proofreading, and much of the typesetting,
pasting up, and artwork, too. I mention this
not out of boastfulness (much) but to reassure
you that every precaution is taken to make
sure the puzzles are correct; there's nothing
more frustrating than spending several hours
failing to solve a puzzle only to discover that
there was a misprint in the setting. In fact, only
once has F E L I X been issued with an insoluble
puzzle, although on two further occasions the
solution has not been unique. One of these
was in the postgraduate F E L I X , so the puzzle
in that issue has been grovellingly withdrawn.
Since many members of college have ready
access to a computer, I try to avoid puzzles
which are easily solved on a machine. O n the
other hand, since IC is one of the top scientific
e s t a b l i s h m e n t s in the c o u n t r y , I have no
compunction in setting problems which need
some slight mathematical ability to solve them.
(Quickie: in your head work out the number of
terms in the expansion of
(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)...(x-z).
Answer next issue.)
All the puzzles are sponsored by Mend-a-
Bike, a firm I can personally recommend very
strongly indeed. They sell new bikes from £65,
second-hand bikes for even less. They are the
OSC
The O S C is made up of nine societies at the
m o m e n t . T h e y are the A f r o - C a r i b b e a n ,
H e l l e n i c , India, L a t i n - A m e r i c a n , Iranian,
Chinese, Turkish, Pakistan and Sri Lanka
Societies. A n Egyptian Society, Bangladesh
Society and and International Society may be
formed soon. All these societies, as well as the
O S C , organise numerous events to help make
overseas students enjoy their stay at Imperial
College. It is essential that you join at least one
of these societies because they are there for
you. All the societies are run by dedicated
students who want to make them as successful
as possible.
You may ask "What's on?" Well, firstly,
there will be a reception for all overseas
freshers in Mechancia! Engineering Room 220,
o n the m o r n i n g of T u e s d a y , O c t o b e r 6.
Secondly, the Freshers' Fair, which takes
place in the afternoon of Tuesday, October 6
in the Beit Quadrangle and on the Queen's
Lawn. Come there even if you are not a
Fresher and meet the club executives, find out
what the clubs do, what they have planned,
a n d m o s t i m p o r t a n t l y , give t h e m y o u r
departmental address so they can get in touch
with you. This is extremely important so that
you can be informed about what is going on.
Thirdly, on Wednesday, October 14, there
will be a Cheese and Wine reception in M E
220. Afterwards there will be a filmshow: Wild
Geese starring Roger Moore, Richard Burton,
Richard Harris and Hardy Kruger. Further
'activities will be publicised in F E L I X , IC Diary,
etc.
closest bike shop to college; they are the only
bike shop in London who do repairs in 24
hours and they give up to 10% discount to
F E L I X readers. They're at Park Walk Garage,
10, Park Walk SW10, or phone them on 352
3999.
Advertisements over, all that remains is to
encourage you to write: criticize the puzzles
you don't like, ask for more of those you do,
send puzzles for publication, donate prizes to
publicise your society...
Finally, the traditional bit about hoping that
you enjoy solving the things as much as I enjoy
setting them. A n d so to this week's puzzle:
Freshers' Hall Hunt
I have been trying to trace four old friends
who are starting at IC this year. I know that
they are all in different departments, and they
have all been billeted in different halls, but for
more information I have had to rely on my
n o t e b o o k . H o w e v e r , I find that I have
combined carelessness with accuracy as only a
puzzle-setter can, and half of each of these five
statements is true, and half is false.
Simon is in Beit and T i m is in Garden.
Quentin is in Weeks and Richard is in
Garden.
M y f r i e n d i n S o u t h s i d e is s t u d y i n g
Aeronautics and T i m is a Biochemist.
Richard is studying Civil Engineering and my
friend in Weeks is in D o C .
Quentin is in G a r d e n and Simon is in D o C .
So who lives where studies what?
Solutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o
FELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday week.
There is a prize of £5 for the correct solution
randomly selected at that time.
Since lack of space prohibits printing the
solutions to the summer puzzles, they will
appear in Friday's F E L I X , and the deadline for
replies is extended to 1:00pm this Wednesday,
October 7th.
