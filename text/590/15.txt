So here we go again. Another year, another
intake and the tense confusion of Freshers'
Week. A hearty welcome to both the Union
and F E L I X . Starting on this Friday we resume
our n o r m a l pattern of appearing weekly.
Reading F E L I X is the only way to keep in
touch with what's going on in and around
College, so don't forget to pick up your copy.
Exec News
Starting in this issue, Exec News (a publication
containing reports by the Executive and U G M
motions) appears as an insert in F E L I X .
Printing 4,000 copies and ensuring that they
reach you on the Friday before each U G M
should mean that you are kept in touch with
what the U n i o n is doing. But y o u must
remember to read it and take it along with you
to the meetings (the first of w h i c h is on
T h u r s d a y at 1:00pm in the G r e a t Hall).
Otherwise you won't be able to follow the
motions and/or screw it up to throw at the
Exec.
Reduced Grants to Universities
Having read M r Morton's article on page 7, I
must say that I am shocked and dismayed.
Using such vile language achieves nothing and,
whilst noting his valid point on the struggle of
the masstes and the overthrow of the state, I
still t h i n k that a Â£200 d o n a t i o n to K e n
Livingstone is ultra vires. Furthermore, Mrs
Thatcher has never done the sort of things he
rudely suggests in public places and blaming
the Domestic Secretary, Captain Lindley, for it
all is hardly convincing. By the way, if this
m a k e s y o u read any of it, more foo
Help, I need somebody
A great deal of hard work goes into producing
every issue of F E L I X . To take full advantage of
the facilities and to expand and improve the
contents I need as much help as possible.
F E L I X is produced entirely on the premises
and involves everything from writing and
photography to preparing the artwork and
p r i n t i n g . If y o u c a n d r a w , w r i t e or are
interested in any aspect of working on a
newspaper, be it reviewing plays or inter-
viewing a Nobel Prize winner, then come along
to the F E L I X Office (on the right underneath
Beit Arch) at Freshers' Fair. Alternatively
come to the first staff meeting at 12:30pm on
Friday.
Hall hall
The new P G Hall in Montpelier Street is, as
yet, nameless. The original benefactor was Sir
Charles Hall, so I suggest Hall hall. Mind you,
with Senior Warden D o n M o n r o taking such a
keen interest in the property, we could name it
M o n r o Villas.
Seriously, the place needs a name, so send
in your suggestions to the Editor, the F E L I X
Office, and I'll print the best/rudest/funniest.
M r s A d a m s
O n behalf of all the F E L I X staff I would like to
thank M r s Adams for her continual under-
standing and kindness. We have relied on her
for many years to perk us up with a quick cup
of tea at o d d times, a n d she has never
complained once. W e will all miss her very
much.
C o p y D e a d l i n e s
Every Editor seems to stress the importance of
copy deadlines. In order to produce F E U X on
a reasonable timetable it is essentia/ that
deadlines are rigidly held. The deadline for the
next issue is 5:30pm today and for every
subsequent issue 1:30pm Monday. Take note
all publicity officers and potential contributers.
Anything received after this time stands little
or no chance of inclusion in that week's issue.
M y thanks....

would now be holding blank pages: Martin
