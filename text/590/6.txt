Imperial College Radio is the only student radio station in London, it
exists to provide music, news and information to the students here. If
you would like to join, whether to present programmes or help on the
technical side 'behind the scenes', o r if y o u are even slightly
interested i n radio there is a n introductory meeting arranged
especially for you this Wednesday evening (October 7) at 6:00pm in
our studio in the basement of 10 Princes Gardens. At this meeting
you can find out about the many different aspects of involvement in
IC Radio, hear about what goes into making a radio programme and
ask lots of awkward questions about how and why we do things. (Of
course, you can also join IC Radio there.)
W e broadcast on 301 metres (999kHz) medium wave to the halls of
residence around Princes Gardens; unfortunately our licence forbids
us to be heard anywhere outside the College grounds, so we cannot
transmit to all IC students. If you don't live in one of the above-
mentioned halls, you still have an opportunity to listen to your own
radio station: we can be heard in the Junior C o m m o n R o o m o n
Tuesday and Thursday lunchtimes on the P A system there, and also
by high-quality line to Southside Bar every night of the week during
opening hours. Plans are in hand for an extension of our 'Lines'
network to the student houses at Evelyn Gardens, however, we have
to rent a line to there from British Telecom (formerly the Post Office)
and they have been very slow supplying it.
The news service of I C Radio provides the most up-to-date
appraisal of events in and around College (apart from F E L I X ) , as well
as bringing you news from the rest of the country and around the
world. In addition to that, in our nightly programme 'Viewpoint' we
present features on particular events in College and interviews with
the people involved in them.
IC Radio is the only station in London specifically playing music for
students; all the presenters are students, but even if you don't like
what they choose, you can phone in a request o n Int 3440. N o w
you've read about it, why not listen?
P S : Don't forget the meeting on Wednesday evening at 6:00pm, or
you can call into our main studio area beside the Southside Shop al
any time.

Student Television Of Imperial College ( S T O I C ) was founded in 1970
to provide publicity for I C Union events through the use of the
College's newly opened T V studio in the Electrical Engineering
department.
S T O I C is now in its twelfth year and has come a long way from its
humble beginnings in terms of programme style, content and
technical quality. S T O I C now has its own closed circuit network
which enables residents of Beit, Linstead, Weeks and Southside to
receive S T O I C alongside B B C and 1TV on their hall television sets.
The Junior C o m m o n R o o m and Southside T V Lounge complete the
campus coverage.
Whilst still relying on the College's educational T V studio, S T O I C
now has its own, in the Union Building, designed and built by
members to enable recording to take place outside College hours
and at weekends.
In general, S T O I C transmits a variety of 'non-topical' programmes
on Tuesday lunchtimes. These include documentaries, celebrity
interviews and a host of quiz shows. O n Thursday at 1:00pm and
6:00pm com.es ' N e w s b r e a k ' , the w e e k l y news a n d m a g a z i n e
programme for IC students. It covers topical events in and around
College by means of studio interviews and location items recorded
using our portable video equipment. Included in the programme is
'Film Review' where the latest releases are previewed with stills and
clips.
