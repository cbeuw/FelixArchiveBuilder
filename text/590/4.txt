FELIX Guide to the First Week
a view from the side
On arrival at Imperial College, most
people have little idea where the
various places of importance are
located within the College. To remedy
this situation the College and Union
conspire on the first day to send
freshers on a sometimes fruitless
search around College for Unioncard,
grant cheque and registration slip.
O n M o n d a y morning queues of almost
Biblical proportions build up in the J C R as
most students attempt to register. T h e
experienced student would probably wait to
register when the Rector's Reception takes
place at 10:00am. This event, which all first
years feel obliged to attend, usually records
a resounding zero on the clapometer with
the Rector, L o r d Flowers, delivering his only
speech yet again. W h e n they have wheeled
the old duffer off, the U n i o n Sabbatical
O f f i c e r s r e - r e a d last y e a r ' s F r e s h e r s '
R e c e p t i o n s p e e c h e s , " g e t i n v o l v e d . . .
r e w a r d i n g . . . U G M s a must etc, etc." This
ends at 11:00am leaving enough time for you
to find your department fpr their intro-
duction; you will have a chance to meet
your tutors for the first time. A t this point
the difficulty of the course and the failure
rates are usually mentioned, as there is no
need for the "nice guy" image now that
you're here.
In the afternoon there is one timetabled
event, the C C U U G M s . These are a must
for those in need of comic relief, or a chance
to beat the registration queues in the J C R .
That evening the U n i o n Building will house
the new year party, a must with many fab
bands, and an introduction to levels of
depravity to which people can plummet.
T u e s d a y m o r n i n g is s p e n t in y o u r
department where the course is explained in
greater detail. A t this time juncture the
dedication needed to complete the course is
raised in graphic detail. However, one does
not need to be Saint Augustine to graduate.
T h e afternoon is devoted to "Freshers' Fair"
where all the U n i o n clubs and societies run
a stall. The societies, which are as diverse as
Badge Soc (exiled to the B r o w n Committee
Room) and Chinese Soc, do their best to
obtain your support and signature.
Of course, the highlight of the afternoon
for many is a visit to the F E L I X Office,
where the Editor tries to cream off the most
interesting and talented of the new arrivals
(sentence: three years hard labour).
B y W e d n e s d a y y o u r e a c h y o u r first
l e c t u r e a n d c o m e d o w n to e a r t h . B y
tradition this is delivered by the most boring
member of the deparment.
In the afternoon the sports trials take
place. The squads are picked early in the
session, so if you wish to play for I C U or
your C C U you must take part in these
trials. There is an R C S Pub C r a w l in the
evening—it is an event which is traditionally
bawdy and gross.
Thursday abounds with lectures and labs.
The Freshers' U G M takes place at 1:00pm.
This is usually a forum for various U n i o n
Officers, who strive to humiliate each other
a n d i n d u l g e in b a c k s t a b b i n g . R u m o u r s
abound that this year the executive will
d e l i v e r their s p e e c h e s n a k e d to b o o s t
attendances! In the evening the Ents film
season begins with Assault on Precinct 13, a
glorious example of senseless violence. T h e
latter part of the evening is enlivened by the
collation of F E L I X . This takes place from
about 9:00pm. The Editor usually regales
the collators with various items that were
either too libellous or indecent to print.
STAFF VACANCIES
At Imperial College you have the
chance to work on one of the most
exciting student newspapers in the
country. There are still vacancies
for:
News reporters
Photographers
Reviewers
Artists
Technical Staff
If you are interested or would like to
suggest your own ideas then come
nto the FELIX Office (on the right
under Beit Arch) at Freshers' Fair or
the to the first Staff Meeting at
12:30pm on Friday.
By Friday everything starts to become
rather normal. In the evening the dregs of
C & G U who did pass their exams hold a
Guilds Bar N i g h t — a n event traditionally
both bawdy and gross. A h well at least
there's F E L I X every Friday.
