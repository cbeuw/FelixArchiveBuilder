CLUBS AND SOCIETIES!
See Exec News insert for locations of Clubs'
and Societies' stalls at Freshers' Fair.
Astrosoc
In case you've mislaid your Handbook (very
likely in the beginning of term rush), Imperial
College's Astronomical Society (Astrosoc to
its friends) aims to cater for anyone with an
interest in astronomy be they a theoretcian, an
observer or simply curious about what makes
the universe tick. For the practically minded,
we own three telescopes: a twelve inch
C a s s e g r a i n a n d six i n c h a n d eight i n c h
Newtonian reflectors—all of which are in need
of some attention. We also have access to a
half-built observatory at Silwood Park, near
Ascot, which, when completed will enable us
to escape from the glare of London skies and
use the telescopes to their full capability. If all
goes well we also h o p e to help in the
construction of a simple radio telescope within
the physics department, and thus extend the
range of our observing programme.
Although last year our observing was limited
by poor weather and lack of enthusiasm on the
part of some members, we still managed a
very full lecture programme, on topics such as
the Daedalus Project, Mars and The Voyager
Missions given by such famous astronomers
as Penny Wright, Dave Laughton, Patrick
M o o r e a n d D r G a r r y H u n t , ' a s w e l l as
m e m b e r s of our o w n physics department
giving talks on their own particular areas of
r e s e a r c h . W e hope to continue this pro-
gramme this year with lectures planned on
such subjects as Specular Interferometry,
Infra-Red Astronomy, X-Ray Astronomy,
Cosmology and Neutrons. Given sufficient
interest there is the possibility of trips to the
Greenwich Observatory, Jodrell Bank and
other places of astronomical interest (though
hopefully not cost!).
W h a t e v e r y o u p a r t i c u l a r i n t e r e s t in
astronomy, please come and see us, if not at
the Freshers' Fair, then at our first meeting in
the second week of term, where the telescopes
will be on display (and in use if the weather is
kind!) and coffee and biscuits will be provided.
Aerosoc
Although this society is primarily that of the
A e r o E n g D e p t , m e m b e r s f r o m o t h e r
d e p a r t m e n t s are w e l c o m e . If a n y o n e is
interested in the occassional visit or talk with
an a e r o n a u t i c a l bias c o m e and manifest
yourself in the Aero U G study room (Roderic
Hill 252) and ask for the society execs.
IC Choir
D o you want to make new friends and enjoy
a varied social life, from ice-skating to classical
concert trips? Would you like to spend a
weekend on a country estate, or perhaps sing
in the Royal Albert Hall before an appreciative
audience? Most of all would you enjoy singing
in a highly acclaimed choir consisting of over
150 male and female voices?
If the answer to these questions is yes, then
Imperial College Choir is where you should
look. O u r Christmas concert will be Mozarts
' M a s s in C M i n o r ' and Geoffrey B u s h ' s
'Christmas Canata' with the Verdi Requiem
and Bach's 'St John Passion' to look forward
to in future months. The first rehearsal of the
term will take place on Thursday, October 8 in
Room 342, Mechanical Engineering at 5:45pm.
Bring a friends and meet many more at
Imperial College Choir.
CONSTITUENT COLLEGE UNIONS*
CCU Freshers' UGMs kick off at 2:30pm.
Venues as advertised.
City & Gmlds\
A big hello to fresh and stale Guildsfolk alike.
This is the day that Guildsheet hits the streets
and you will doubtless read therein of the non-
a c a d e m i c t i m e t a b l e for this week. T h e
Reception U G M this afternoon will (God and
Day Bookings willing) be held in M e c h Eng 220
at 14:30 (half past two to you M r Smith). This
bit of F E L I X will normally be written by our
Publicity Officer who will hopefully do it better
than this. Excuse me while I put my head in a
bucket of water.

C&G Vice-Publicity President
PS: The barnight is on Friday; Tiddlywinks on
Saturday.
Andrew was so excited when he handed me
this article that he forgot to mention the
Guilds/RCS JCR Party on Thursday, October
8. There's a band called Really and disco, all';
for a quid. See you there-Ed.
Well girls and boys, here we go with another
exciting year here at R C S U , and what a fun
time we're going to have. To all our new
visitors, welcome to the big school, and I hope
that you will enjoy your stay here, however
short it might be.
Uncle David, Uncle Andy and I have been
busy organising lots of games for all you little
people who are lucky enough to want to be
scientists when you grow up, so that you can
have lots of fun in the first week.
To start off with we are holding a jolly union
meeting in the Great Hall at 2:30pm (big hand
on the six, little hand on the two), when you
can all see us being enthusiastic, and then that
evening we have organised a party with the
rough children from the two reform schools,
which could be lots of fun.
O n T u e s d a y t h e r e is a s p e c i a l treat
organised by M r Nathan, Life Sciences Dep
Rep, called the Life Sci Party. Anybody can go,
though, provided they bring a bottle or a few
cans. So get the cream soda out, and we'll all
have a spiffing time.
ICYHA
The aim of I C Y H A is to get you out into the
beautiful British countryside using y o u t h
hostels to stay at. O u r first activities this term
will be a weekend in the Peak District on 16-18
October, and a cycling trip to the Chilterns.
D e t a i l s of the t e r m s a c t i v i t i e s a n d the
slideshow will be at the Freshers' Fair.
Dancing
Don't be shy; be inquisitive, and come along to
the J C R in the Sherfield Building at about
7:30pm on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.
(Starting Monday, October 12.)
The club caters for beginners on Tuesday
and Wednesday evenings during the first term.
If you feel you are more advanced, then come
along on Monday evenings to learn a few more
intricate steps. We also offer opportunities for
the competition and medal dancer—in fact, we
can boast a very high success rate in last
t e r m ' s m e d a l e x a m s , a n d a v e r y g o o d
performance in the Inter-Varsity D a n c i n g
Competition.
As well as lessons, we also organise social
events; the two highlights this term being the
L o n d o n B a l l , w h i c h is an event for all
standards (Friday, December 11), and our own
A n n u a l D i n n e r a n d D a n c e ( S a t u r d a y ,
November 28).
Remember, one day you may wish that you
could dance—so why not come along and
learn? Or at least have a good time as you try
to!
For further information, contact Maggie
Feirn, Physics 3, via the Physics letter-racks.
Wednesday evening sees the pub crawl,
starting at Stans with drinks between 7:00 and
7:30pm, but I'm afraid that really only the
bigger children should be allowed to go.
O n Thursday evening M O P S O C are holding
a Cheese and Wine Party, and no doubt will
be discussing mathematically how many
glasses they have d r u n k , and afterwards
feeling physically sick. (Groan.)
The big event of the week is the nice game of
tiddlywinks along Oxford Street on Saturday.
We all meet in the R C S U Office between 9:00
and 9:30am and then off we go for a pleasant
morning winking. We play ring-a-roses around
Eros at 12:30pm, and then dive into the
Cockney Pride before returning to the R C S U
Office for d r i n k s , c o u r t e s y of the V i c e
President.
And to round the week off, on Sunday we
will be going out for the afternoon with the big
red fire engine, possibly for a picnic (depending
on the weather) and then returning for the
bar night with songs and other fun in the Union
Bar.
There will be lots of exciting things going on
arranged especially for you. So please take
advantage of them and don't forget to get your
tickets for the freshers dinners which are on
sale now.
