It’s that time of year again when all the
girls are wondering if it’s possible to go
to a party dressed as a scary witch, a
pumpkin or a rotting zombie and com-
ing home alone with the word ‘GEEK’
written across your forehead in perma-
nent marker.
The most important thing to remem-
ber is that your Halloween costume
should not be scary. You want people
to run towards you not away from you
in a dark alley. One of my favourite tac-
tics is to use this holiday as an excuse
to wear my saucy bedroom attire in
public. For example, bunny ears, a tail
and a corset always go down well. Of-
ten literally!
We all know the benefits of wear-
ing easy to remove clothes compared
to skinny jeans which won’t come off
your feet at the crucial moment or, say,
a rubber cat-suit. Perhaps the latter is
just me? In this this situation, I recom-
mend talcum powder and turning the
lights down.
Some suggestions (girls only because
boys end up looking a bit camp):
Pirate ship’s wench:
White shirt revealing sexy bra un-
derneath, lots of gold jewellery (pref-
erably, bought for you by a rich man),
a short skirt or shorts, something tied
around your head (which will not mess
your hair up too much once you take
it all in the bedroom and be careful
to tie it baggy around the top of your
head otherwise you will look bald) and
of course, thigh high boots- every girl
should own a pair.
Devil:
Horns and red underwear.
Playboy bunny:
Playboy ears and black underwear
Catwoman:
Cat mask and black underwear. (This
is especially good when you’re having a
bad day and want to hide your face.)
Maid:
White apron, underwear and feather
flicker (to come in handy later on in
the night)
Minnie Mouse:
Mouse ears and spotty underwear
It is a given that all these outfits must
be accompanied by high stiletto heels
with stockings and suspenders (fish-
nets at a push).
Note, Marks and Spencers basic
whites are NOT suitable underwear

The winner of Slitherlink 1,412 was
Yu-Xi Chau ! Congratulations on win-
ning another puzzle. Your on fire inn
metaphoric sense. Please keep enter-
ing. We’ll give a prize out in the sum-
mer. It’ll be good.
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar
to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw
lines between the dots to create one
long, and most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start or finish;
just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many
lines should be drawn around it, for
example:
Cells which don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any number of
lines.
Remember, the line must form a
loop, so the line cannot branch. The
following situations are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There
are never cells containing the number
4 in Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most
common place to start on a Slitherlink
grid is by drawing crosses around any
zeros. Drawing crosses is purely done
to so that you know where there can’t
possibly be a line. So, take the pattern
below as an example. Begin by drawing
crosses, then by filling in some lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the
following directions:

Last week somebody did actually
write in, the answer of course
was BUMLICKER, I was too
excited. Well done to Yu-Xi
Chau the solution was oh so easy.
for this purpose. Do not come crying
to me if you get laughed at wearing
bunny ears and a tummy tuck girdle.
Dear Tamara,
For ACC barnight the theme was un
PC (politically incorrect). and I dressed
up as a member of the KKK. I thought
it would be ok because my friend went
covered in black paint and an afro wig..
Now everyone wants to kick my arse .
What can I do?
Death row Politician
Dear Death row Politician,
I do feel slightly guilty for gig-
gling over your sense of humour. It is
of course, despicable. You have two
alternatives:
1. Run away and never come back.
Change your name, have a nose job
and move to another big city. Avoid
places such as Cornwall as they are bad
hiding places - unless your mother is
your sister you will stick out like a sore
unwebbed thumb.
2. Laugh it off and wait for someone
else to do something more stupid next
week.
Dear Tamara,
I have been very mean to a fellow
physicist for the last few weeks and have
suddenly realised that I need her help
with some work because I am too stupid
to do it myself. How do I get back in her
good books and get her to help me?
Dumbass
Dear Dumbass,
This is your own stupid fault really,
isn’t it? You shouldn’t be mean to peo-
ple of superior intelligence and looks.
It will always come back and bite you
in the arse.
I suggest you employ bribery: Find
out what she likes and then buy it in
large quantities for her. Most impor-
tantly, don’t ask for help at the same
time. Wait for it to sink in overnight
and only the next day, having greeted
her with a toothy grin and a “Well,
good morning, how are you feeling to-
day?”, should you approach the touchy
subject of asking for help.

Imperial College Boat Club advance
2 top 10 places secured at GB trials and ICBC medal at small boats head
It is hard to ignore the fact that 5 of
the 6 Olympic rowing medals won this
year were by either current or past uni-
versity students. The quality of rowing
demanded and improvements in train-
ing are continually pushing athletes to
the national standard. It is therefore no
coincidence that this year’s rowing GB
trials were run in conjunction with the
British Universities & Colleges Sport
(BUCS) Small Boats Head (SBH) held
at Boston Rowing Club, Lincolnshire.
ICBC had entries for both GB trials
and SBH, coming away with two top
ten trial finishes and medalling in all
three SBH divisions.
Team ICBC left London early last
Saturday morning to undergo a 2km
ergo (indoor rowing machine) test at
the Princess Royal Sports Arena. Suc-
cessful meeting of the expected GB
ergo standards meant progression into
the single sculls 5km trial on Sunday.
ICBC’s Ole Tietz (U23 Lwt) made
apple strudel of his competitors by
smashing his PB and making the GB
national standard with over 23 seconds
to spare. A tidy profit was made selling
seconds to less conditioned athletes
unable to make the standard. ICBC
triallists performed well with E.R. Go
(Concept RC) coming away the overall
winner on the day.
After a gruelling day at trials there
were no casualties. Except for Adam
Seward. A ‘back injury’ manifested
in the minibus on the journey from
London. Understandably, Adam was
confused as to the correct way to sit
in a moving vehicle. Stabbing pains
were reported when coming within
earshot of an ergo flywheel. A medi-
cal note was somehow produced. We
hope his recovery will be as speedy as
his injury.
Back at the ‘Comfort’ Inn, Team
ICBC were presented with a potato
lasagna. This didn’t go down too well,
for reasons I have yet to understand.
Unimpressed with the food, Coach
Stuart Whitelaw miraculously hit upon
all the ingredients necessary for that
Santa-red glow and will be making an
appearance at this year’s ICBC Christ-
mas Party.
On Sunday morning, ICBC had 6 en-
tries in the heavyweight (M1x) and 5
in the lightweight (LM1x) men’s single
sculls trialling for GB squads. Leander’s
Ian Lawson secured first place in the
M1x with a finish time of 18:09.68 and
was one of 4 Leander entries to make
the top 10 of 84. ICBC aim to be in
this position in the near future. ICBC’s
Simon Hislop came 10th overall in
19:00.84 while Dan Cadoux-Hudson
also had a strong performance coming
24th overall (11th in U23).
In the LM1x, ICBC’s Adam Free-
man-Pask, in a gesture befitting a
man of good breeding came second
(18:43.31), allowing Stephen Feeney
of London RC (18:41.35) to have his
Cristina Duffy
So, do you row that boat or just carry it?
glory for the day. Big Andy (Andrew
Gordon) also impressed coming 29th
overall (18th in U23).
In the BUCS Small Boats Head there
was further success for ICBC crews
who won medals in all three divisions.
Pasklop was in action again, this time
under the guise of a coxless pair and
a bronze medal was collected: the slip
to third place reportedly due to mid-
race arguing about an email concern-
ing a lunch date. When separated and
given their own boats, the pair were
individually more successful and both
claimed silver medals: Hislop in the
M1x and Freeman-Pask in the LM1x
races. In the Men’s championship
double sculls Henry Goodier and Dan
Cadoux-Hudson were witnessed cut-
ting some shapes down the river and
came home in third place. Alex Gillies
and Andy Gordon tore up the field in
their Lwt2x. Wheels smoking like true
lightweights, they finished 4th in a hot-
ly contested event.
Thus ends another successful week-
end of racing for ICBC ahead of the
major Fuller Four’s Head of the River
Race which takes place next Saturday
November 8th. ICBC are holding their
annual club dinner the same night at
the Knighstbridge Hotel to celebrate
with many special guests. Contact John
Davey at j.davey07@imperial.ac.uk to
secure your ticket.
