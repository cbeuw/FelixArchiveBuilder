Sir Richard Sykes takes
up role as Chairman of
Imperial spinout company
Daniel Wan
Correspondent
Sir Richard Sykes, Imperial’s ex-Rector,
has taken up his first professional role
since leaving College at BioCeramic
Theraputics Ltd. Sir Richard becomes
the new Chairman of the Board of Di-
rectors with immediate effect.
It seems Sir Richard cannot get
enough of Imperial College, where
which he spent seven controversial
years (2001 –2008) as Rector. BioCer-
amic Theraputics (BCT) Ltd is one of
over 60 Imperial College spinout firms;
being based on developmental research
from the Departments of Biomedical
Materials and Material Sciences at Im-
perial College.
A King’s College biochemistry grad-
uate, Sir Richard’s role at BCT will not
be his first in this vein. Prior to accept-
ing the post of Imperial’s Rector, he
was chairman of pharmaceutical com-
pany GlaxoSmithKline plc. His role at
BCT is seemingly a smaller task than
GlaxoSmithKline, as BCT is seen more
to be an up-and-coming pioneer rather
than a multi-national corporation.
As Sir Richard takes over as Chair-
man, the companies are focusing their
efforts in two generations of products.
The first is strontium-containing glass
that inhibits pathogens and promotes
tissue growth. This versatile material
would be used as bone filler, coatings
and even as structural scaffolding in
orthopedic procedures. Furthering on
this, the company is also developing a
nanostructured mimicry of the extra-
cellular matrix that will surpass the
capabilities of the bioactive ceramics
which are currently used.
Daniel Green, BCT’s CEO, com-
mented on the appointment: “Sir Rich-
ard’s immense experience and expert
guidance will be invaluable as we move
to the next stage of our growth plan:
taking our lead development products
to a stage where they benefit the pub-
lic.” Sir Richard’s role will aid the taking
of scientific knowledge and application
to a business level, something that was
very evident in his time as Rector. He
was responsible for several controver-
sies including the rebranding of the

Prime Minister
visits Imperial
The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown,
was visiting Imperial College on Mon-
day to attend “The Changing of a
New Economic Age” event hosted by
the Imperial College Business School
(Tanaka). Brown delivered a speech to
academics, business leaders and mem-
bers of the press on his government’s
plans to deal with the global credit
crunch and restructuring of the UK
economy. Attending his speech were
the likes of Iain Conn, Director of BP
and Chair of Imperial College Business
School Advisory Board and Ian Cole-
man, Global Head of Emerging Mar-
kets at PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
During his speech he described his
special connection with Imperial Col-
lege, saying: “I have seen the expan-
sion of this College and how it leads
the world in so many different fields.”
Brown also addressed the importance
of maintaining public spending in
bringing the country out of the eco-

nomic downturn. He said now was the
wrong time to slash investment in ar-
eas like education, training and energy
efficiency or tax cuts for hard-pressed
families. The PM defended his strat-
egy of higher borrowing to support
the economy, calling it the “responsi-
ble” thing to do. His remarks came on
a day where the London stockmarket
plunged by more than 5% and the ster-
ling weakened again. Brown’s speech
was followed by a Q&A session with
his audience, chaired by Professor
David Begg and attended by Imperial’s
Rector Sir Roy Anderson.
During his visit the Prime Minister
also found time to meet with ten MBA
Students from Imperial’s business
school to discuss the global credit cri-
sis and hear their views. One student
remarked, “I agreed with a lot of what
Mr Brown said and he is taking a very
proactive approach to finding a solu-
tion to the economic problems.” While
another simply felt, “it was a privilege
to meet him. He was very easy to talk
to and he seemed really relaxed.”
We used to talk about
hippies with guitars
Imperial College Union’s Career Fair
saw unwelcome song and dance from
protestors on Wednesday 29th
October.
A group of IC student protesters form-
ing the group “e.on f off” gathered at
South Kensington in the early hours
of the morning. One member had
brought with him his guitar, for what
was presumably a planned activity.
Upon the lunch hour the “hippie”
antagonist began to play some of his
hit tunes against Shell, including the
allegedly popular “Use soul power, not
coal power.” He was promptly removed
by Imperial College security, not to be
seen for the rest of the day.
When asked why the reason for a
protest, one “e-on f-off” representative
began to regurgitate lines such as “e.on
want to build 6 coal factories, and are
currently getting permission for the
first one. If the first one is approved,
they have plans to build 17 others
within Europe and Russia.

Alexander McKee, a representative
from Imperial College Union, com-
mented on the protestors breach of
conduct, telling felix that “they were
told not to protest inside, not to cause
any major scenes, to just distribute in-
formation outside the marquee.” This
was not the case, with the protesters
operating directly in front of the e.on
stall. felix also has it’s doubts if the gui-
tar playing man was actually a student
of Imperial College.
The topic of higher education has come
into the limelight again after David
Lammy, the new Minister of State for
Higher Education, commented that
there might be too many universities
in the United Kingdom.
The remarks were made in an ad-
dress delivered at a Universities UK
(UUK) event on the 14th October, en-
titled ‘The Future Size and Shape of the
Higher Education Sector’.
The new minister pointed out several
problems facing the higher education
sector, as well as possible solutions.
In his speech, Lammy asked: “Do you
have the right number of institutions?
In the commercial sector there would
have to be many mergers over the
next few decades – far more than we
have seen in higher education. Could
more be done to encourage that among
universities?”
The idea of merging universities has
existed for some time now. Back in
November 2002 the previous Rector,
Sir Richard Sykes, attempted to form
a merger between Imperial College
[IC] and University College London
[UCL]. However after four weeks of
talks, the proposal was called off. Sir
Richard claimed that it had “become
clear that the best interests of our two
institutions are not served by a formal
merger.” One senior academic from
UCL told felix about IC’s political in-
tention, describing the proposals as
a takeover rather than a true merger.
The academic referred to the situation
as “more of a rape than a marriage.”
Ultimately, the merger crumbled
since many UCL academics feared that
it would leave many of their scientists
without jobs, whereas Imperial’s staff
would suffer far less.
Since the introduction of the Further
and Higher Education Act in 1992, the
UK has seen the creation of some 60
new universities. The current number
of higher education institutions,
according to the University and College
Admissions Service, is 325, which goes
a long way to helping the government
reach their 2010 target of having 50%
of 18-30 year olds in higher education.
The current financial state of
universities was also one of the topics
of discussion in Lammy’s speech. Many
universities rely on student fees to
remain financially viable, though many
have already claimed that this model
is not a feasible one, with Lammy
believing that it is unsustainable. Top-
up fees were introduced back in 2006,
after much complaint, with students
paying around £3,000 per an academic
year. Indeed Sir Richard commented
last October that he is in support of
increasing Top-up fees to £5,000 after
the 2009 review. Lammy, himself, is a
graduate of the School of Oriental and
African Studies (University of London)
and Harvard Law School, regularly
receiving requests for donations from
the latter. Contributions from alumni
are a source of funding the minister
highlighted for future consideration
by UK universities. The views of the
current Rector, Sir Roy Anderson, are
as yet still unknown; however, he did
comment in his Commemoration Day
speech that entrance exams will be
brought in by 2010, in response to the
current number of applications where
he said that “we cannot continue on
this path”.
Contradicting government policy,
John Denham, Secretary of State for
Innovation, Universities and Skills,
said in August this year: “There are
certainly young people who currently
go to university who would have been
better off on an advanced apprentice-
ship. We have been in danger of mak-
ing it sound as if university is the only
real aspiration.”
This echoes the view of Sir Richard
who said last October that “the system
has to change. It will then make peo-
ple think twice before they go off and
do those damn silly courses that are
no good to them and won’t get them a
good job at the end of the day. It would
mean university is not just a nice four
years off.”
This Wednesday, the Government
announced they will be cutting stu-
dent grants after discovering a £200m
funding shortfall. Last year, students
were eligible for a grant if their par-
ents earned less than £60,000, however
this has now been cut to £50,020. The
decrease in the limit is expected to af-
fect 10% of students starting next year,

there are “too many universities.”
some 40,000 students. NUS President
Wes Streeting commented that “the
Government needs to stop tinkering
with grants and fees every year, and
recognise that the entire higher educa-
tion funding system is unsustainable.”
Liberal Democrat University spokes-
man Stephen Williams went on the
record as saying that “ministers got
their sums completely wrong.
“This kind of incompetence is not
going to persuade young people that
the Government is committed to sup-
porting them with their studies.
“As we enter a recession, ministers
are going to have to face-up to the fact
that more students are going to be ex-
pecting to receive maintenance sup-
port in the years to come.”
The higher education debate will
undoubtedly continue for many years,
as the balance between a good quality
degree and the financial consequences
of getting one are established.

past.
