Hockey on fire
Wednesday saw the Imperial College
Hockey Club 1st team take on the Uni-
versity College London [UCL] seconds
in the first match of their 2008 BUCS
Cup campaign.
The Imperial team stamped their
mark on the game from the start, scor-
ing four goals in quick succession.
Sach started the proceedings with
a swift reverse sweep - cunningly
poached on the line by Stumpy. Other
goals included a solidly taken short
corner drag flick from Ewan Quince
and a nifty deflection on the post by
Paul.
Later in the half Diana scored a well
placed penalty flick after a lifted shot
from Stumpy was denied on the line by
some admirably committed defending.
From the picture it can clearly be seen
that the poor guy was in pain, but like I
said, it did stop a goal.
At the end of an impressive first half
display the score was 6-0. In the second
half UCL managed to recover some co-
ordination in defence, however apart
from a few minor counter attacks,
UCL offered little offensive threat as
they played deep within their own half
to relieve the pressure.
Surprisingly the second half resulted
in only two further goals from Impe-
rial despite a good number of short
corners and shots.
The final score was a resounding
8-0. The win means progression in the
BUCS Cup and gives the team con-
fidence heading into next weeks im-
portant league fixture against St Bart’s
1st XI, which promises to be a tough
match.
Sachin was a clear man of the match,
demonstrating a killer finish on both
the forward and reverse sides that
bodes well for the rest of the season.

Welcome to another week of sports
at Imperial. The new BUCS cup has
started, now allowing most teams
at Imperial to be able to experience
the rollercoaster ride of knock-out
tournaments.
However, there has been a mixed
bag of results. Teams from hockey and
rugby progressed, in addition to a good
day for the footballers with the 2nd XI
overcoming a bad run of results with
a convincing win over Roehamtpton.
Men’s Badminton and the netballers
will want to quickly forget their cup
losses and concentrate on the league.
felix will be covering the BUCS cup
matches extensively in the coming
weeks, so for those of you still in the
competition, bring your A game, get
those wins and write some reports to
us! The felix sports league table is be-
ing finalised as we speak, and will be
ready as soon as a few more BUCS
games have been played.
For those of you still looking for a
sport and/or are unconvinced by get-
ting up to play on Wednesdays, we
hope this weeks reports from table
tennis, ultimate frisbee and water polo
can whet your appetite and inform you
on the wide range of sports on offer by
ICU.
The ACC bar night on Wednes-
day was enjoyed by many teams and
demonstrated the “work hard, play
hard’ mentality for our sports teams.
With many clubs having a multitude
of teams, ex-professionals right down
to social players can experience the
camaraderie and the enjoyable atmos-
phere present in the union.
