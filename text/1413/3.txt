E
ngineering As the current Deputy President of
ICSM Students’ Union, it would be a
great honour for me to represent the
Medical School as an Ordinary Coun-
cil Member. Since starting at ICSM,
I have immersed myself in Medical
School life as much as possible by be-
ing involved in the Football Club and
Drama Society, as well as helping to or-
ganise events such as the Halfway Din-
ner and RAG Fashion Show. My role
on the Students’ Union this year has
brought me into regular contact with
ICSM students both young and old,
and I feel I am now perfectly placed to
make your views heard at Union Coun-
cil. I will do everything in my power to
ensure that ICSM students are given
a strong voice and that you all benefit
as much as possible when important
decisions are being made. Vote for me
and I will take care of the rest.
Undergraduate Councillors
The ICU council makes decisions on a
wide range of issues, everything from
NUS membership to campus re-de-
velopment, and all of these decisions
affect us as medical students. There-
fore it is hugely important that we are
strongly represented as medical stu-
dents on the council, to make sure that
our voice is heard! For the last three
years at medical school, I have been
actively involved in clubs and societies,
being in ICSM netball club and back-
stage manager of light opera society.
If elected, my aim would be to listen
to all the diverse views of members
of our medical school to ensure that I
was representing what people want at
ICU council meetings. I am passion-
ate about ICSM maintaining a strong
presence within IC, so please vote for
me and I will do my best to ensure that
you are represented well. Thank you!

My name is Salman Waqar and I’m
currently in my third year. I hope to
stand as an ICSM rep on the Union
Council this year. Most of you probably
don’t really know much about, or even
care about what the Union gets up to
and what it does. In fact, I’m guessing
you’re only on this page because you
want your favourite club or society to
have an extra bit of dosh. But there
is an awful lot the Union can do, and
it does achieve things for us Medics.
And I feel it’s important that we have
full and proper representation on the
main body of the Union; we make up
a pretty big proportion of the College
population and we ought to have an
equally loud voice. I have been actively
involved with many clubs and societies
during my time here. I occasionally
write for Felix and currently, I am the
Treasurer for EMSA and I manage the
website for MedSin. So, vote for me if
you want an honest and solid person to
represent your concerns and opinions
to those crazy guild hacks!
Standing for IC Council feels like a
natural step for me. I’ve been active in
local and national politics since I start-
ed Imperial 4 years ago. I’m currently
Vice President of ICSMSU and have
held the position of ICSM’s BMA rep
for the last 2 years.
I intend to use my capacity on the
council to represents your views hon-
estly and transparently. It’s important
for us to be pro-active and to not allow
apathy to dictate the tone of student
politics. I believe strongly in medical
education and good education at that.
I co-edited and co-founded the foun-
dation school guide ‘Quack’ which has
been delivered nationally to all final
year medical students for the past 2
years.
A vote for me is a vote for a hard
working, politically-minded and hon-
est candidate, who believes strongly in
students and student activity.

Hi everyone, my name is Nida and I
hope these are good enough reasons for
voting for me this year: I talk... a lot - so
if you want someone to kick up a fuss
about issues we students feel are impor-
tant I’m a pretty good choice for getting
the guys that call the shots listening. I’m
active - being involved in many societies
including debatesoc, and am currently
vice president of ISoc - coordinating
events and taking part in different fund
raising schemes around university (and
you know I’ve got to be organised to fit
all that in around the insane amount of
work we get set) But most importantly
I’m an Imperial student - I visit the same
campus (campuses... campii?), use the
same facilities and union as you guys -
and will take a position on council se-
riously to ensure college policy always
prioritises its students.
‘Democracy is the only system that
persists in asking the powers that be
whether they are the powers that ought
to be’ - Sydney J. Harris
Whoever you are, whatever your is-
sue, big or small, I will ensure your
voice is heard.
Imperial College boasts an incred-
ible wealth of talent and creativity
amongst its student body. It is there-
fore my belief that the union should
be as transparent and accessible to its
students as possible. With their input
and participation, the Imperial College
Union really can reach for new heights
and thrive.
A vote for me is a vote for fairness,
equality and justice.
Sammi Elfituri, fighting for and on
behalf of the IC student since 2008!
Undergraduate Councillors

ion Dining Hall at 6.30pm and stand.
Ali Mozaffari
I am running for the Union Council
because during the few years I've been
here, I can honestly say I don't know
of anything worthwhile the union
has done. Maybe that's because they
haven't, or perhaps because they just
don't promote their achievements well
enough - either way an uninformed
student body is as bad as an apathetic
one.
If elected, it would my and fellow
candidates’ responsibility to question
the union's judgement, raise student
issues and promote the union work
where necessary. Being involved in
clubs and societies since I joined Im-
perial, I believe that I can lend an un-
biased view of how students really feel
about their activities.
Standing as the non-faculty member
means I can take an interest in all areas
of the student body, it also means that
I can take the opportunity to (some-
times constructively) criticise the un-
ion, where necessary, on a whole range
of issues.

Elections and manifestos explained for you
T
he faces you see spread
across the following
three pages want you to
do something for them.
They want you to vote for
them.
The Trustee Board is the overseeing
committee at the top of the Union. Big
decisions may have to be made here,
but less frequently.
Council is one of the most important
committees within the Union as the
decisions made by it affect every stu-
dent on campus. Most importantly, the
Members of the Council are given the
power to vote on decisions brought to
the Council. Giving this power to the
wrong person could potentially have
adverse consequences.
Councillors meet roughly once a
month to discuss the overall direc-
tion the Union is going in. The people
throughout these pages will have to
give their views on this decision as well
as many other important ones.
Below are their manifestos, ready for
your analysis. Read each one and de-
cide whether you like what they have
to say, whether you agree with them
and ultimately, whether they represent
your views. If you’re not happy with
any of them, you can vote RON (re-
open nominations). If RON wins, the
Union will run the elections procedure
again.
If you didn’t know that the elections
were even taking place, you might still
be able to stand. Some of the faculties
still have outstanding positions to fill,
so get involved.
