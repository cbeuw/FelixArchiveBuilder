Stuff IC Students Like!? :)
Photoshop Competition - 5
Ravi Pall
Coffee Break Editor
A
ppolgies my avid readers.
Last week was a some-
what poor effort. I know
it’ no excuse, but as the
deadline crept ever for-
ward, I found my self too involved with
other events. I can’t guarantee this
won’t happen again. Ahwell.
Well, as things settle down in college,
and people start working hard, I would
like to point out that you will need to
take a break from work in the foresee-
able future. I do this all the time, so it
must be fine. Last night I went to Fab-
ric, It was awesome. On tuesday I went
to a civilised boat party. It’s the little
breaks that help you get through Im-
perial College.
Now for a rant. Not enough of the
freshers make an effort!. Beit had a
halloween party the other day, and
on general the costumes were above
average. However there wasn’t one
costume that was spectacular. I’d ad-
mit i thought the two guys who came
a priest and his child rape victim was
pretty funny, but nothing amazing.
Even one of the sub wardens came as
the terminator (with half his face blown
off) and looked freaking sweet. So why
then can’t the freshers pick up the ball?
Another case was the ABC party. ABC
means anything but clothes... why did
come people turn up in jeans or a T-
shirt? I do think more should be done
to impress. I know we are all students
with low incomes, but all you need is a
creative mind, bin liners, tinfoil, duck
tape and a small aubergine.
In other news, the FUCKWIT League
has expanded due to an executive deci-
sion. Not only does it include the pho-
toshop competition, but the slitherlink,
wordoku, crossword and double points
for the cryptic crossword. So Start en-
tering multiple puzzle entries, the first
entry we receive will get 5 points, 4 the
the next, 3 after that etc. Take a look
at the league table to see how your do-
ing, and how close you are to winning
that iPod.
This week Snaky B is dressed up a Os-
ama Bin Laden. A Controversial issue?
I think not. And well done to whoever
photoshoped the image. Classic! There
have been requests from withing the
felix office, for Snaky B to bring out
a single. I personally think it will be
number one in Top of the Pops. We’ve
also got a feature article about a new
brand of sandwich’s found in the JCR.
For the record, this is not photoshoped,
but is extremely fake. They were real
snacks that were horrifically altered
with the use of an incredible Sharpies
marker. On another note, was anyone
at the careers fair on wednesday? If you
were please email in any pictures you
may have of the crazy hippie guy on
guitar. Thanks.
6. Dads Music:
Everyone at Imperial College loves
the music their parents listen too.
Now they may not be willing to admit
it, thinking they might loose the lit-
tle bit of street cred left, but it’s true.
You may be saying no now, but go
to cheapskates, or the union and 10
pints later Brian Adams is on. Every-
one is shouting the lyrics to Bohemi-
an Rhapsody. Obviously not to Brian
Adams. That would be foolish.
Classics include:
Queen
David Bowie
Brian Adams
Jimmy Hendrix
Thin Lizzy
Black Sabbath
Europe
Blur
Eurythmics
Neil Young
Blue osyter cult
And many mnore that won’t fit into
this box. Go ask your dad.

This weeks winner. Team rapid bunnyz Next weeks RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk
Congratulations to this week’s win-
ner, Team Rapid Bunnyz. I personally
love the tag line (which is most likely
not clear enough to read at this size).
It reads “Delivering Coffee to a union
near you.” Great stuff. The felix office
was extremely pleased to see the cast
from aquateen hunger force muscle in
on the tiny coffee cart. It almost looks
likesn the guy on the right is think-
ing “WTF is meatwad doing here?”
Also Frylock and Master Shake. This
Drink with me, I’m Snaky B
and this week I’m dressed as Osama B
week’s image is from the carrers fair.
It’s from the philips stall, and the pic-
ture currently reads “give a new twist
to her life” which we think is hilarious.
On another note, what is this guy do-
ing in the picture?
The high res picture can be found
online. Click on Coffee Break in the
sections tab. Email your entry to cof-
fee.felix@imperial.ac.uk with your
team name and .PSD file and you’ll be
entered into the FUCWIT league.
D
eath to the infidels. I
Snaky B am the great
Osama B, and with my
mighty terroist cell of
cider and larger we will
destroy the bitter and soft drinks of the
westunionbars.Iamsoconfidentinmy
terrorist abilities I wear live grenades
as a vest, and carry and AK 47 with one
hand.. Seriously all the other terrorists
are wimps, they all have dummy gre-
nades. They all say “oh but if I get hit
by an bullet i’ll blow up” or “the AK has
too much recoil, I dislocated my shoul-
der one time.” They should be ashamed
to call themselves terrorists. What do
they do? Nothing. I, however, took out
the American economy.. Wait too far?
Sorry, i’m realy only a pint of snake
bite. My appologies, have a snake bite
next time you in the union. Tell them
Snaky B sent you. They’ll know what
your on about. Well i’m off to hide in a
cave with my dialysis machine. see you
later you western scum.
My mother is starting to think I dress
up every day now. Not cool. What will
I be dressed as next week? Pick up the
next issue of felix to see.
Carlos Santana who? Dad I don’t like your music. I’ve told you before.

Virgo
What is with those
damn long hairs,
always inflicting
their misguided
commie ideals on
the poor student
population. They should learn that greed is
good, fast cars are awesome and that breathing
in coal dust is good for the lungs. I hope that
they take their organic hemp fibre ropes, find
an old English oak in an ancient wood and
hang themselves from the highest branch.
Scorpio
This week you
realise that felix
horoscopes are
probably not
written by anyone
with knowledge of
astrology or with any skills as a medium. This
is a crashing blow, especially because you’ve
been following their advice religiously for the
past three years.
Libra
This week computer
glitches will
conspire against
you downloading
the latest Serbian
donkey porn. Maybe
our dear editor will have to rely on more
archaic forms of entertainment to exercise his
wrist, perhaps even his imagination. Rumour
suggests that he may have quite a depraved
one.
Sagittarius
This week you were
late finishing your
felix pages because
you were distracted
by a poster about
pigs and goats.
Seriously, I think this place needs some new
posters, nice to see those lovely naked hockey
ladies still have pride of place. The flyer invit-
ing us to hold our Christmas dinner at the
Jury’s Inn must be out of date, I’m pretty sure
the football club got us all banned from there.
Capricorn
This week it
becomes apparent
that having facial
hair just wasn’t
meant for you.
No one has quite
plucked up the courage to say it to your face
yet, that will happen on Tuesday. On Saturday,
you will shave, and will realise you now have a
really unfortunate tan-line where your beard
once was.
Cancer
This week you
will continue to
annoy, irritate and
generally upset
your siblings.
If the fact that
you are a constantly nagging thorn in the
side of your close family comes as a shock
and upsets you then I suggest that you stop
being so opinionated, dull and annoying. Or,
alternatively, ignore everything that I’ve said.
Gemini
This week it has
been decided by the
government to strip
all Gemini of their
saving accounts in
order to help those
people born at other times of the year whose
needs are more worthwhile. If you wish to
avoid this unwarranted, prejudicial taxation
then the best advice is to hide all of your
money under your pillow, you miserable old
tight arse.
Leo
This week you
should strive to be
less shy and stop
hiding yourself away.
People are more
understanding than
you may think and may not be put off by that
hideous facial disfigurement of yours, after all
there are much worse examples available to all
and sundry on the web. Who knows, you may
even meet a lovely blind person.
Taurus
Seriously, are
you that bored in
lectures that you
have to entertain
yourself by reading
this drivel. I suggest
that you find a better way to pass the time,
maybe by not attending lectures at all and
downloading illegal movies off the tinterweb.
(felix does not condone missing lwectures or
the illegal downloading of copyright material)
Aries
This week the after
effects of the ACC
bar night continue
to haunt you. Not
only were you left
with an infernal
hangover but you will be constantly reminded
of the humiliation of your drunken antics and
sexual advances. Just one piece of advice, you
had better get checked out down at the clinic,
you filthy pervert.
Pisces
This week an
argument will
rage as to what
are the melodic
accompaniments
best suited to a
working environment. The heavens dictate
that there is only one form on music worth
listening to, the power ballad. So settle down
at your desk and get to work while bathed in
the sweet sounds of Boston’s More Than a
Feeling.
Horoscopes: protégé of Russel Grant edition
Aquarius
This week you won-
der whether going
to the careers fair
had any purpose, as
the current financial
climate seems to be
against any chance of you gaining meaningful
employment. Fear not, it is written in the stars
that you will find work, under the tutelage of
Ronald Macdonald flipping burgers beneath
the golden arches.
Guest writer Tarquin Quimbiff brings his own unique style to the horoscopes. Enjoy!
Where is my dialysis machine?

JCR offers new delights
Think you’re eating healthy? Try Danger Cranks!
Have you been feeling down lately?
Need an extra boost in that miser-
able existence of yours? Perhaps you
just want more protein in your diet?
Read no further. Our Coffee Break
team in the field have found the cure
to all these problems, as well as some
others. That’s right we even found the
cure to herpes. Here’s a clue, it’s not
pro plus mixed with relentless. It
is a brand new
super sand-
wich called
“Danger
Cranks.” If
you didn’t
guess it 15 seconds ago then you’re
an idiot. It’s in the subtitle and the
picture.
Already at a JCR near you, Danger
Cranks is the curb stomp you’ve all
been waiting for. Full of all that good
grade E meat, vomit, last years salad
and secret special sauce (A.K.A se-
men). When asked, the head of Veg-
Soc (we won’t name him here because
we don’t know his name and are too
lazy to look it up) expressed his inter-
est in the miracle product, stating “I
do love me a bit of Danger Crank.”
For all of you who don’t know
what a crank is; it’s a combination
of crying and wanking.
Couple this with a little risk
and you have the fabled Danger
Crank. This is where you call for your
mother and try to finish making semen
salad before she walks in. Incidently Se-
men Salad is a vegetarian dish made by
the same company as Danger Cranks.
We don’t know how much a Danger
Cranks sandwich is but we did hear
from a reliable source that you don’t
have to pay, you just kiss the cashier.
Someone else told us you had to be
circumcised, the catch here is it has to
be performed Jov. I’ll be honest, I just
don’t know.
With the hit success of the Danger
Cranks brand, Danger Cranks PLC has
given us exclusive rights to inform you
about their upcoming products, Rain-
bow Shakes and Chocolate Starfish.
We’re sold already.

Photoshop Competition and the eventual Quick Crossword. 4
points for second, 3 points for third, 2 points for fourth and 1
point for fifth
