GSA and Trustee Board

I’m a physicist. I know, forgive me.
However, during my time at Imperial
College, I have taken a keen interest
in the welfare of the student body, and
the benefits the student Union should
provide to the current and upcoming
generations of this prestigious univer-
sity. I would like to think of myself as a
fun, outgoing and social person. How-
ever this is only my opinion, and prob-
ably not want you want to hear.
As a Student Trustee, I will endeavor
to guide the Trustee board (the govern-
ing body in the operation of the Union)
in a more just and student-oriented di-
rection. I have great confidence that I
am an accurate description of the aver-
age IC student, and as such, will grap-
ple the throats of the Union sabbaticals
other Union staff to gain a fair and just
position for us students.
I don’t think my past year would have
been any different if the GSA didn’t ex-
ist. Most postgraduates I’ve brought
up the the GSA with, don’t know what
the acronym stands for, or what it’s
supposed to do. Which, let’s face it, is
diabolical. I shall not attempt to slate
the existing team or beguile you with
promises of realising some utopian re-
unification between academia and so-
cial inclusion, but I could radically im-
prove things. I don’t believe academia
has to be a sanctuary for the socially
repressed, so let’s not let it be. Things
could be a lot, lot better. Conformity
suggests I should inform you of my ex-
perience running societies and events,
but that will seriously impinge upon
on the 150 word-limit. Essentially, I
see the main focus of the GSA being
postgraduate welfare and filling in the
PG social-gaps the main union leaves.
Thanks, Rhys.

Jenny Lim
GSA Secretary
HELLO ALL! My name is Jenny Lim
and I’m standing for the position of
GSA Secretary. I’ve always wanted
to get involved in a committee and
thought - this year is going to be the
year!
To be quite honest, I’m not really
sure what the role will require of me,
except that I will be able to push for-
ward views of the graduates to the GSA
for: A.C.T.I.O.N! I will definitely work
hard to make it a successful year for all
of us!
Importantly, I’m based at Hammer-
smith Campus which can be quite
under-represented, so I will take good
note of the views of students at this
campus to ensure they get their say on
things! That won’t mean neglecting the
rest of you, of course! Actions speak
louder than words so... just vote for me
and you won’t be disappointed! I look
forward to meeting you all!
Tom Van Den Bremer is also running for
this position, but has not submitted a
photo or a manifesto.

Several other positions are still available in the GSA. If you wish to stand for these po-
sitions, come to Council on 17th November in the Union Dining Hall
As a five-time (local) Emmy Award-
winning journalist, and the main an-
chor for the KVWN Channel Four
News Team, I know I’m good. I mean
really good. Hey everyone, come and
see how good I look.
Anyway, these guys are major league
bull. If you like me more than you like
them, because lets be honest I am the
Ron Burgundy, then don’t waste your
scotch by throwing it in their faces. I
love scotch. Scotchy, scotch, scotch.
Here it goes down, down into my
belly... yeah! Last time I looked in the
dictionary, my name’s Ron Burgundy.
I’m kinda a big deal round San Diego.
What do you mean this is England,
London? Not that it matters, as long as
I can play my jazz flute who cares? Hey,
Aqualung!
When i’m not pumping my guns, or
bumping nasties with you and your
dirty whorish mouth, I’m discovering
the finer mysteries of life. Like the lost
meaning of the words “Sand Dieago.”
So if you’re a hot, female/female look-
ing person, looking for a night out on
the Burgandy roller coaster, then for
Stay classy San Diego, I’m Ron Burgundy?
just one night let’s not be co-acquaint-
ances. Let’s be co-people.
All I have left to say now is, ladies
and gentlemen, can I please have your
attention. I’ve just been handed an ur-
gent and horrifying news story. I need
all of you, to stop what you’re doing
and listen. Cannonball!
Oh yeah, If you think everyone else
is in no way better suited to their posi-
tion than me, then on Sweet Lincoln’s
mullet vote for RON. By the beard of
Zeus don’t let anyone not good enough
for the job get in. Please.
