OK. Here we go. It’s election time in
the United States, in case you hadn’t
noticed, and last week’s wildly success-
ful thematic crossword has inspired
me to go crazy again.
Pay attention, though, because I’m
only going to say this once. There are
no across or down clues this week,
only state names. You have to decide
whether a state will swing republican
or democrat – if republican the word
goes down, if democrat the word goes
across. My predictions, of course, are
open to human error.
To help you out, the letters of the
words, taken in normal numbering or-
der, spell out a prophecy of Nostrada-
mian proportions.
Oh, and one more thing: www.cross-

Table tennis
The Men’s 1st team travelled to UCL
to begin their campaign for the new
season. The BUCS South Eastern Con-
ference has been reshuffled into two
tiers of 6 teams with IC in the upper
tier. The team itself has a new look
about it as well, with Darius Atashroo,
Hua Aun Tan and Heng Kai Lee com-
ing in to replace departees Kevin Kan,
Gaetan Gourmelon, Jerry Liu and club
stalwart, Wei Lun Wong who have all
graduated. The four to face UCL con-
sisted of the aforementioned newcom-
ers plus Eddie Liu.
The match was pretty much inci-
dent-free, though Hua Aun did endure
a short time-out to the First Aid room
during his second match, after cut-
ting his thumb on the edge of the table
from his own rasping forehand win-
ner. Despite being hampered in play-
ing some of his shots, Hua Aun and
indeed IC looked to have the beating
of our London rivals. Though with the
scoreline tied at 4-4 as we approached
the halfway mark, things were getting
tense. Eddie and Darius had both lost
out to UCL’s number 1 in hard-fought
matches which could’ve easily gone the
other way. Still, encouragingly all 4 IC
players managed to register 1 win each
from the opening 2 rounds of games,
and this confidence boost would prove
to provide the spark which would
see us safely to victory in the closing
stages, with IC winning 6 of the final
8 singles.
What was also quite nice was by the
end of the evening all the noise was
coming from the Imperial corner and
we felt like the home team. Well, home
advantage doesn’t count for much in
table tennis, except where dodgy light-
ing and tables are concerned. But any-
way, the guys had the crowd support
from what seemed to be their own
personal cheerleaders - actually, it was
just Darius’ young lady friend and this
other girl who happened to be there
(don’t know her story, but she decided
to support us). It was much appreci-
ated. Darius and Eddie rounded off the
evening by taking the doubles and so it
finished 11-6 to Imperial.
Credit must go to both teams for
playing a very sporting match and we’ll
look forward to hosting UCL in the re-
turn fixture. Next up is a home game
against LSE, who are traditionally a
strong side, so it will surely be an in-
triguing contest.

Hockey still dominate
As the season starts to pick up pace, the ICHC men and women
stay one step ahead of the rest of the field
Our first game of the season
and already 3 players down (one
drunk+highheels=crutches, one pneu-
monia sufferer, one enslaved to JMC)
captain Kebab was understandably
nervous.
Conceding the 1st goal evidently
fired up the home team as we dominat-
ed possession for the first half, some
nice work from the left back Leper set-
ting up some great runs up that side.
Finally IC’s persistence was rewarded
with a goal as Praying Mantis pushed
the ball over the line. Clearly the ex-
citement was too much for fresher
Harriet as shortly after she forgot she
was playing hockey and rugby tackled
an opposition player to the ground in
pursuit of the ball. At half time we
were equal footing, something quickly
rectified with fresher Teddy, putting us
2-1 ahead. Teddy was later heard to
say ‘it felt pretty good’ although wheth-
er this was in reference to the goal or
activities engaged in with certain male
hockey players we can only speculate.
Our lead was short lived as some dis-
array whilst subbing lead to a sneaky
goal from the opposition. Perhaps the
frustration was getting to the freshers
at this point as Teddy was soon green
carded for attacking from behind, and
Harriet missed a one-on-one chance
with the keeper.
Thankfully, the older members of
the team held it together, Dominator
Sarah Clayton & Elliot Dyke marking out the player from an attack-
ing run with MJ executing a stunning
slide tackle to block a potential shot
(MJ also managed to hold herself to-
gether with no dislocated shoulder to
report this time). The ball was quickly
cleared and after an awesome cross
from Malvinas, was flicked on by Ted-
dy, with a cheeky last minute deflection
from fresher Wide-Open to bring us
back ahead 3-1. IC kept the pressure
up, with Token Lezza working the new
diamond formation, until Fresher Sam
found the back of the net. 4-2 with ten
minutes to go the IC defence withstood
fresh onslaughts from the opposition,
fresher Chealsea managing to disrupt
play every time she touched the ball.
Then in the final two minutes Wide-
Open was sent off for repeated stick
tackles, leaving a depleted IC team to
hold the visitors at bay and secure our
first victory of the season.
Special thanks to fresher Katie who
came to support in spite of her pneu-
monia, and the mens 3’s for providing
post match naked entertainment.
So the Ladies elite were a success,
but what about the Gentlemen’s social
elite!
This game had the makings of a clas-
sic after previous encounters in recent
years where results have been good for
both sides. RUMS started the game in
a brisk fashion scoring early on with a
wellworkedsoloeffortfromtheirno.10,
who had clearly played at a higher level
before. With the aim to get revenge for

Imperial College Swim & Water Polo
Club’s swimming team took part in
two galas last week, in preparation
for next month’s BUCS Short Course
Championships in Sheffield.
Having only just recovered from
Monday night’s Freshers’ Social, which
saw swim and water polo clubbers old
and new taking Tiger Tiger by storm,
Thursday evening took the swimming
team to London Bridge to face local
rivals Kings and Queen Marys in a
“friendly” gala with a palpable com-
petitive edge. Inclusion of 25m sprints
alongside 50m and 100m events meant
plenty of chances for all to gain valu-
able competitive experience. Storming
swims included sibling rivalry from
the Monaghan sisters and Tom W-C

swimming his BP in the 100 Fly, an im-
pressive feat so early in the season.
Saturday gave swimmers a chance
to venture further afield. Cambridge
University Swim and Water Polo Club
hosted their annual Relays Gala. This
gala features relays in all strokes, oblig-
ing competitors to swim outside their
favoured disciplines. The events cul-
minated in an 8 x 50m mixed relay in
which a striking display of team cama-
raderie resulted in domination over
our rivals, Kings.
The evening didn’t end there as we
headed to one of Cambridge’s favour-
ite clubs for food, drink and dancing…
and didn’t make it home until the wee
small hours. To find out more about

rial, whatever your background, email

Ultimate Frisbee party hard!
Mr G. Fish
Last Saturday, the discDoctors (dD)
went to a beginners’ tournament held
in Loughborough. In the past it has
been a cracking tournament, starting
the year on a high note and allowing
the freshers to discover what competi-
tive ultimate is like while having a lot
of fun as well.
A few of the freshers were concerned
that their throws weren’t good enough,
last year’s cup defeat, RUMS continued
to press forward and were rewarded
midway into the first half with 2 quick
fire goals that called for Imperial 4s,
a.k.a. the DeIViants, to ring a few
changes in the defence, most notably
with the introduction of Harry, who
took up a sweeping role, to man mark
no.10. This sparked a revival from Im-
perial with several counter attacks and
well worked passing moves involving
Al, Luke, Rob, Doug and James to get
back into the game. RUMS were on the
back foot and just before the half was
up Imperial took advantage of some
short corners to win a p.flick which Al
then dispatched with style, aiming for
the bottom corner with the ball end-
ing up straight down the middle. In the
second half Imperial sensed a come-
back was on the cards and should have
reduced the deficit further. Unfortu-
nately for Imperial, this was not to be
and risks had to be taken at the back
allowing RUMS to break dangerously,
on several occasions, resulting in two
more goals. One where keeper Alex re-
strained himself from one of his Super-
man dives and their striker was quick
to finish, the other was a rebound from
a deft shot which had struck the post.
Imperial continued to play with an at-
tacking mentality but in the end RUMS
came away deserved winners of what
was an exciting game!
With success across all teams so far
this year, it is now the turn of the tour-
ing squad that will venture to Bright-
on this weekend for fun, frolics and
champagne hockey. Previous so called
‘Fresher Tours’ (to which all freshers
are encouraged to come) have visited
the dark depths of Somerset and the
fabulous city of Oxford. Thanks to all
those involved in the organisation.
that they couldn’t catch and they didn’t
understand the game either. But their
fears were allayed when I admitted I
didn’t understand the game either and
I’ve been playing for ages. With respect
duly won from said freshers we all got
the train to Lufbra where on arrival we
dumped our stuff where all the other
teams were staying and headed off
for food and more drinking. We were
scheduled to play six short games dur-
ing the day and we arrived at the sports
hall in the morning optimistic of im-
proving on our 18th seeding. The opti-
mism didn’t last long as we were beat-
en 7-0 by Haze 2 (the Loughborough
team) but we rallied magnificently to
win 4-3 against Leicester, 5-3 against
Bradford, 7-3 against Aberystwyth and
5-2 against Bangor. We lost a crucial
game against Airwolf 3-2 and so con-
fined ourselves to the bottom half of the
28 team tournament. With the games
over for the day, we had got ourselves
ready for the party. It was fancy dress
and we went in budget-we-bought-
this-from-Primark/Camden army gear.
Think fake blood, ripped manky green
tops and an inflatable gun. We picked
up the best 3 pint challenge time and
had a great time in their union among
the ridiculously dressed before calling
it a night in the early morning.
We awoke nursing our morning stiff-
ness and groggy heads and got ready to
play three slightly longer games. With
only 3 games we couldn’t afford to
waste time playing ourselves into form.
Thankfully our first game was against
some kids and we trounced them 8-1.
Next up was Leicester again and this
match was also a close affair with a
mammoth point at the end that we just
snatched to win 3-2. Our last match
was effectively our final and we really
hoped to win it but we were outplayed
by a good Durham team and lost 5-1.
Nevertheless the weekend was great
fun and every beginner improved sub-
stantially. Credit to the experienced
players for helping and to the freshers
for turning up.
