IG LEADS MOVES FOR
NEW TRAVEL SERVICE
ICU PRESIDENT, Nick Brayshaw, and External Affairs Officer,
Hngh Barrett, have this week been-heavily involved in discus-
sions aimed at setting up a London Student Travel Bureau to
provide, on a brokerage level only, similar services to those of
the now liquidated NUS Travel.
A t a meeting on Wednesday
night leaders of some 4 0
London S t u d e n t unions,
including I C U , were told of a
plan to s e t up such a travel
bureau. Trevor P h i l l i p s , L S O
secretary, and author of the
plan, envisaged a pilot scheme
with three retail outlets, sited
at the University of London
U n i o n , Imperial C o l l e g e and
Queen Mary C o l l e g e , where
former N U S T r a v e l offices
e x i s t . Mr P h i l l i p s pressed for
a 3 week trial of the scheme
to test its v i a b i l i t y .
But this was not agreed to
at the meeting. Instead,
student leaders decided to
elect a committee to look into
the proposals. I n the meantime
they w i l l go back to their
unions to get support for the
idea and, p o s s i b l y , f i n a n c i a l
backing. No monetary commit-
ments were made at the meet-
ing although the I C U E x e c ,
who had seen Mr P h i l l i p s ' p l a n s
theday before, had provisionally
agreed to spend £50 on a pilot
scheme.
L a s t night this 7 man
committee, which includes
both Hugh Barrett a n d N i c k
Brayshaw, expressed optimism
about getting a n alternative
Travel Service for I C students
very soon.
N e v e r t h e l e s s , Mr Brayshaw
is s c e p t i c a l about the scheme's
v i a b i l i t y , since NUS Travel
had always maintained that
winter provided the least
business o f the year. Both he,
Richard Silver ( U L U President)
and Marcus Turner ( Q M C
President) are a l s o disgruntled
that Trevor P h i l l i p s wants to
see L S O running the n e w
bureau. T h e y , and I C U E x e c ,
would prefer to s e e a more
general and stable body — such
as U L U — in administrative
charge rather than L S O .
I C U E x e c u t i v e would show
more favour to the scheme if
assurance that the B r i t i s h R a i l
Student C a r d would be available
for the bureau to s e l l were
g i v e n . A t present, B R h a s
indicated that they are w i l l i n g
to continue the c a r d . H a l f
_price tickets w i l l s t i l l be
available to those with C a r d s ;
those who have yet to purchase
a card c a n s t i l l do so by writing
to their B r i t i s h R a i l area o f f i c e .
Up t i l l five years ago I C U
did have i t s own travel broker-
age scheme which was making
a profit.
Another organisation that
has already agreed to help
any new student travel bureaux
is the Student A i r T r a v e l
A s s o c i a t i o n ( S A T A ) . T h i s i s
the centralising body that c o -
ordinates a i r travel operations
of many student travel
organisations across Europe.
S A T A has agreed to become
an a i r travel booking agency
for any local student travel
bureaux a n d provide the
services it d i d to N U S Travel
T h e A u s t r i a l i a n T r a v e l
Service, w h i c h operated flights
down under with N U S has a l s o
indicated i t s w i s h to help
these new bureaux. The Euro-
train f a c i l i t i e s may a l s o
continue, although negotiations
are not y e t at a c o n c l u s i v e
stage.
The d e c i s i o n to wind up
N U S T r a v e l along with 2 N U S
printing companies had been
taken at an emergency N U S
Executive meeting last
F r i d a y . Throughout that week
the Boards of the companies
had been exploring ways of
avoiding liquidation. A t one
stage the s e l l i n g o f E n d s l e i g h
Insurances w a s considered,
but this would not have raised
sufficient capital to see N U S
T r a v e l permanently out of the
red.
ElVz M LOSS
NUS T r a v e l crashed with
losses just under £'/4M„ O f
these the main creditors are
the International Student
T r a v e l Conference and B r i t i s h
R a i l . C h a r l e s C l a r k e , N U S
President, h a s refrained from
commenting on how much each
is owed, but The Guardian put
the amount to B r i t i s h R a i l at
£'4M. I C Union i s i n fact owed
£300 i n back rent for the N U S
T r a v e l office a t I C .
Nobody on N U S T r a v e l
holidays w i l l be stranded due
to the A B T A bond.

s Test Loophole
The September i s s u e o f
' W h i c h ' , the Consumer C o u n c i 1's
magazine, has exposed another
loophole i n the means-test,
A c c o r d i n g to ' W h i c h ' , i f a
student i s over eighteen,
unmarried, and not earning over
£350 a year, the student's
parents can p a s s their parental
contribution through a c o v e n -
ant to their son or daughter.
The advantage comes through
tax relief o n the covenant for
the parent, and reclaimed tax
for the student, providing he
or she earns l e s s than £350.

T h e Grub War continues at
C e n t r a l London P o l y , but the
student strategy of boycotting
the N e w C a v e n d i s h and Wells
Street C a n t e e n s on 16th
November i s unlikely to starve
out their adversaries, the
T a y l o r p l a n caterers.
In their assault o n t h e
New C a v e n d i s h redoubt, the
students were hepled by
inside agents (a shop-steward
and staff of T a y l o r p l a n ) and
by some N U P E members.

Having tailed to buy N e w

C o l l e g e , L o n d o n , h a s agreed
to rent it from the s u c c e s s f u l
bidder, the Open U n i v e r s i t y .
Half of the £35,000 b i l l for
renovations w i l l be met by
the University Grants C o m -

that New College w i l l become
a mixed, intercollegiate hall

to c l o s e down the three
companies rather than risk the
National U n i o n itself failing
through a banking set-off
arrangement.
Under this arrangement the
National U n i o n ' s general
account maximum l i a b i l i t y
was either the amount in the
account or the amount over-
drawn by the service companies
as a whole, which ever w a s
the l e s s e r . Hence if the three
companies had not been put
into liquidation, a situation
could have arisen where a
failure of one or a l l of them
endangered N U S ' s s u r v i v a l .
L a s t F r i d a y ' s action pre-
vented such a failure, although
a little amount of money was
lost by this s e t off arrange-
ment when the companies were
liquidated. T h e exact amount
was not made clear at a
Student press conference on
T u e s d a y . Some student leaders
do put this i n the region of
£10-50,000. C h a r l e s C l a r k e ,
has already promised a full
financial, breakdown of t h e
elfects ot the failure at next
month's N U S Conference.
