4 - F E L I X N O V E M B E R 26th 1976
New ideas for a lost cause
Two weeks ago F E L I X reported
new developments to help overseas
Students at Imperial College. In
particular we drew attention to a
group of activists who wanted to give
a new life to overseas student affairs.
Here the same activists outline
their plans in an open letter to a l l
IC students.
IC's Overseas Students Committee
(OSC) h a s been very passive over t h e
last year, probably due to loose organ-
isation now more than ever, s o w e
a c t i v i s t s from overseas, together with
some I C U officers, have come together
and tried to change the old form of t h e
OSC, to a new form which w e think w i l l
be more effective in dealing with our
common problems. In the new form, the
OSC w i l l be a new major sub-committee
of I C U C o u n c i l a l l national s o c i e t i e s
wi II be aff Mated to the new sub-committee.
A new constitution has been prepared
and w i l l be submitted to council for
approval. B y the time this is done, a
general meeting of overseas students
w i l l be c a l l e d to elect the e x e c u t i v e
committee, etc.
The new O S C w i l l aim to:-
(i) bring overseas students together,
by organising s o c i a l events (ie cultural
evenings, to help exchange of knowledge
on how people in our countries live and
what their objectives are.
The Links Club, conceived on
26th October 1926 by a young Ameri-
can anglophile, 'RIP' Mayor, and
three fellow Guildsmen, 'John 'Millard,
'Bobbie' Mayes and 'Percy' Shelley,
celebrated its fiftieth birthday with a
special Anniversary Ball on Sat. 30th
October.
No contemporary record of this
information e x i s t s except by way of
recollection. T h e original Minute Book
and Dinner Book m i s s i n g for many y e a r s ,
mysteriously arrived at C o l l e g e on the
Thursday before the anniversary. The
record of the first dinner and meeting,
held on F r i d a y 10th December 1926 i n
the Mars Res taurant, Soho (now demoli shed)
contains the following:
This memorable occasion of the first
meeting opened with musical honours,
'Pug' being at the piano and well
assisted by the Links Chorus
A very enjoyable meal followed inter-
mingled with wit and wisdom, fast and
furious jokes, the clank and clink of
glasses. 'RIP' rose: "We are gathered
together for the first time as 'Friends,
Goodfellows, Sportsmen'; for what better
reasons could we meet? The foundation,
the ideals and objects of the Club are
bound up in these words, they form the
keynote of our existence as a corporate
body: that we may ever prove true,
loyal and cheerful, and that our acts may
always be those of men and sportsmen."
The meeting was adjourned at 10.30
pm when:
Several Links thereupon wended their
way into the blazing night of L ondon
town in search of entertainment a nd
amusement. Rumour hath it that they
visioned the dawn of day.
L i t t l e h a s changed i n those f i f t y
years.
Well, that gives a brief explanation a s
to why some Guildsman c a n be seen
wearing those navy, blue, maroon a n d
pink striped ties on Thursdays. T h e
final paragraph from those first minutes
probably help to explain other b izare
Thursday phenomena. E a c h new member
elected to the C l u b i s given a nickname
and a link bearing h i s name i s added to
the L i n k s C h a i n . T h e precepts of the
(ii) organising activities related to the
problems facing overseas students in
this country, eg, discrimination in tuition
fees, racial discrimination, restrictions
on immigration and vacation work.
The case of overseas students is not
at a l ! limited to the arguments about the
level of the tuition fees, (which h a s
risen from £80 in 1967 to £416 in 1975).
Rather, it i s one s p e c i f i c aspect of wide
ranging links that exist between the
third world and the western powers.
After World War 2, there w a s an
'economic boom' in the western world
and there w a s urgent need for labour.
In Britain, workers were needed a s train
drivers, nurses, cleaners and s o o n .
People from the West Indies, A f r i c a ,
India, P a k i s t a n came over here to do
precisely these jobs. But these workers
were never told that they were needed
as cheap labour.
Again in the past, the British
Government had welcomed students from
her c o l o n i e s and other under-developed
countries, because they were needed to
man her colonial and neo-colonial
apparatus.
Yet, with the British economy facing
the worst c r i s i s s i n c e the war, the
immigrant workers and overseas students
find themselves faced with racism and

C l u b nave been maintained to a greater
or l e s s e r extent since 1926 and the C l u b

There seems no reason why it should not
continue to do s o .
On 27th May 1935 the minutes record:
After many good stories, we adjourned
to the bar where we commandeered a man
with a banjo and sang ourselves hoarse
until closing time much to the amusemen{
of a watching policeman above.
In 1943 the war and other more usual
events(!) depleted the returning members
at the start of the '43—'44 s e s s i o n t o
just three, two of whom had only been
elected the previous term and the third
the term before that. T h e C l u b ' s c o n -
stitution had not foreseen this difficulty
and was temporarily suspended (ICU pay
no attention!)
In later years, to prevent the d i s -
banding of the C l u b , the constitution
was amended, including an article stating
that the d i s s o l u t i o n of the C l u b could not
occur unless consent of a l l the members
and Queert V i c t o r i a w a s obtaineu. T h e
future of the C l u b seems secure.
Of those four founder members, ' R I P '
Mayor died about five years ago, ' P e r c y '
Shelley w a s last heard of in Burma i n
1931. The other two, ' J o h n ' Millard and
' B o b b i e ' Mayes, were both able to
attend the Anniversary B a l l , together
with five other L i n k s from the 1 9 2 0 ' s .
Judging by the comments in the dinner
book p a s s e d around at the B a l l , the
evening w a s a splendid s u c c e s s . ' ' A
memorable e v e n i n g " said 'John M ' ,
" N e v e r to be forgotten", ' B o b b i e ' .
being toid that they are no longer wanted
in this country.
Attempts are being made to isolate
the overseas students through racist
p o l i c i e s . If the overseas students a r e
defeated, the Government w i l l face a
divided and hence weakened student
body. More attacks on the student body
wiII then follow.
In brief, our struggle a s overseas
students is one with that of the immigrant
workers, w h o are much more exploited
and oppressed. It is a l s o inseparable
from the economic struggle of B r i t i s h
students.
A s long as we are compelled by
circumstances to come to this country,
we s h a l l fight discrimination and a n y
attempts at further exploitation.
