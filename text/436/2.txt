That Rag Committee meeting Linstead fallacies
Dear Sir, — With reference to
the article on R a g on the
front page, and the editorial
in last w e e k ' s F E L I X , w e ,
the undersigned (who a l l
attended the meeting) w i s h to
object most strongly to the
reporting.,
We feel that at no stage
did any C C U participate in
"inter and i n t r a C C U b i c k e r i n g "
or " w r a n g l i n g " to " u p h o l d
the image of their C C U " . . A n y
d i s c u s s i o n , although heated
at times, w a s directed at the
leaders of the R a g Committee
on a united C C U front. It
seemed to u s that it was being
left to the C C U s to organise
the majority of R a g Week, and
c a l l i n g a meeting the day
before it started, s o that w e
could do t h i s , appeared to
be impractical.
After some sensible c o n -
versation a l l matters were
resolved, and there i s no
excuse at a l l for the reports
in F E L I X , w h i c h made the
meeting appear to be unpro-
ductive. T h e s i t u a t i o n ' w a s
obviously overdramatised due
to the need of a good front
page story.
We feel that there i s an
obvious lack of leadership on
the committee, but we cannot
in any w a y deride the effort
of the C a r n i v a l Co-ordinator,
Secretary and Treasurer, since
they have h a d to pick up the
dregs after the summer. It i s
with great regret that this
letter has had to be written
but incompetent reporting has
grossly mis-informed the whole
of Imperial C o l l e g e ,
Y o u r s faithfully,
P K u r o w s k i

NUS Time to get out
Dear S i r , — T h i s letter h a s
been written in the light o f
l a s t F r i d a y ' s s t a r t l i n g
announcement from the N U S
E x e c u t i v e that they intend to
c l o s e down the U n i o n ' s travel
and printing s e r v i c e , due to
their accrued deficit of over
£500,000. I suggest that the
time is here for us to' again
examine our p o s i t i o n with-
in N U S .
But before we j o i n the band
of d i s s a f i l i a t i n g unions l e d
by Edinburgh, I would l i k e
to elucidate some of the
implications and how we c o u l d
cope with them.
In last term's debate o n
whether N U S w a s representa-
tive of students, Charles
Clarke used h i s p o l i t i c a l
rhetoric to the utmost. I a s k
y o u , how c a n a group of f u l l
time officers represent the
views of students, the ranks
of whom they left many years
ago? Surely our representative
should be c l o s e l y i n v o l v e d
within student c i r c l e s , at the
grass roots l e v e l , a n d b e
democratically e l e c t e d .
Do I hear cries of more
bureaucracy a n d e l e c t i o n s ?
Quite p o s s i b l e , but not
necessary as we already have
someone who can f i l l the r o l l ,
the U n i o n P r e s i d e n t .
One of the p r i n c i p a l factors
that bonds the N U S together,
i s the c l a i m that they c a n
present a strong bargaining
body when putting forward the
student c a s e to the government
over matters such as grants
fees and graduate unemploy-
ment, areas i n which I feel the
N U S must be given s ome
credit.
What i s against the I C U
President putting forward the
v i e w s of Imperial C o l l e g e
students to the Government or
other interested bodies?
A t least he would have
credibility. If he were to feel
isolated there i s nothing to
stop communication with other
Union P r e s i d e n t s to formulate
a unified front. Surely this
type of external involvement
i s what we expect from our
President and if he feels this
would involve too much work
then would he not be absenting
part of his responsibility?
F a r rather our external
policy i s involved i n matters
which directly involve Imperial
College students i n preference
to the spurious p o l i t i c a l and
ideological debates over
matters alien to us.
A s for the s e r v i c e s that the
NUS offer: I can't think of any
sector in w h i c h we a s a
Union would be incapable of
developing an alternative.
When considering t h i s , remem-
ber that we would have an
extra £5,000 in our coffers
that would otherwise have gone
to the N U S . E n d s l e i g h Insur-
a n c e , which according to our
N U S E x e c u t i v e i s profitable,
would be a v a i l a b l e to you as a
student, whether y o u be a
member of the N U S or not. In
any case it has often been
stated that one c a n obtain a
better insurance deal from
many of the large insurance
groups, after a l l insurance i s
a competitive market.
Now is the time to stand
on our o w n , to communicate
with other institutions but
overall to develop the services
we need and w i l l use.
T h e d e c i s i o n to leave will
be harder to make than the one
to stay i n , but a short term
loss would soon be forgotten
in the light of long term gains.
Yours faithfully,
J O H N M O R G A N

Dear Sir, —There i s much more
agreement than he supposes
between Mr Cheetham's think-
ing — both h i s c r i t i c i s m o f
college residences and h i s
praise of the knightsbridge
A s s o c i a t i o n plan — and the
thinking behind the alternative
proposed by Mr Gardiner a n d
myself. In the latter we have
tried to demonstrate the
economics and feasibility of
a human scale l o w rise
solution, which would harmonise
the interests of both students
and residents.
The difficulty i n making
the comparison Mr Cheetham
wants to make, however, i s
that the Knightsbridge A s s o -
ciation scheme accommodates
only 72 students and i s
enormously expensive. Whereas
Stephen Gardiner's plan
attempts to meet the C o l l e g e ' s
brief a s far a s i s p o s s i b l e ,
and within the limits of the
benefaction. T h i s i s not e a s y .
The scheme wins on c o s t s ,
yet it already represents a
compromise (280 hall places)
between the C o l l e g e ' s target
(which i s s u e d in daylighting
infringements and conditions
that I d i s l i k e a s much a s Mr
Cheetham does) and the lower
accommodation targets, which
would give the space a n d
privacy Mr Cheetham very
understandably d e s i r e s .
Of course larger quadrangles
and fewer rooms would make
our scheme better. That i s
what we should have l i k e d .
Meanwhile, though, even i n
the scheme as it stands, Mr
Cheetham is wrong about the
quadrangles. Their s i z e i s
comparable with that of
several treasured public
gardens in the C i t y . L e t Mr
Cheetham explore the squares
and a l l e y s between C a r t e r
L a n e and the river.
Comprehensibility. Mr Gardiner
and I have offered to e x p l a i n
what schemes like h i s would
be l i k e . T h e Union E x e c u t i v e
has not responded to this offer.
Furthermore its comments on
the scheme have rested on
several serious misunderstand-
ings.
Sports. Mr Gardiner's report,
sent to the C o l l e g e , made
suggestions about new
locations for these.
C a r s . There i s no prospect of
the benefaction being available
to accommodate cars in the
manner envisaged by the
Knightsbridge A s s o c i a t i o n . If
Mr Cheetham l i k e s low r i s e ,
human s c a l e buildings, l o s s
of parking i s the consequence.
He cannot have everything.
Yours sincerely,
D A V I D WIGGINS

Critics corner(ed?)
Dear S i r , — I should like to
express my extreme d i s s a t i s -
faction with recent i s s u e s of
F E L I X , particularly number
434. Surely there i s not such a
shortage of contributions, or
alternatively such a l o w
standard of literacy among
your readers, that one page
needs to be occupied by a
rather facile depiction of
Morphy D a y , and the centre
spread almost wholly c o n c e a l e d
by banner headlines advertising
R a g Week. I realise the need
to make a v i s u a l impact on
the reader, but surely items
of such doubtful relevance are
carrying this too far; o n e
would expect a newspaper to
provide a certain amount of
reading matter, a service
which appears to have been
neglected.
Having said this, I must
welcome the disappearance,
in issue 434, of the opinionated
and sometimes contradictory
comment appearing in the
' W h a t ' s O n ' section. C a n Ian
Morse c l a i m that conducting a
personal vendetta against
'Sounds' (from whom the
concert information appears to
be borrowed, judging by the
identical printing errors) i s
the legitimate function of such,
a column?
Comparing the technical
standard, and apparent expense,
of production of Sennet a n d
F E L I X , one would expect a
similar superiority of c o n t e n t '
in the latter. U n l e s s material
of more relevance and interest
to 1C students i s i n c l u d e d ,
this unenviable comparison
may be continued; the gate o f
Sennet needs no further
comment.

IAN MORSE rep lies :-
You are quite alert in your
assumption that the gig guide
is obtained from Sounds. As
for me conducting a vendetta
against this poor-mans NME;
if pointing out unaccuracies of
truth entails the term 'vendetta'
being used, then I see little
harm in it, although two small
pieces concerning Sounds can
hardly justify a 'vendetta'. To
conclude, I am told some
people actually find the
'What's On' column both
interesting and informative.
Need a lift give a lift
A file of those requiring
lifts (by car) to I C and those
prepared to offer them i s now
being compiled. D e t a i l s —
please keep these to a
minimum — should be place
on a plain postcard and sent to
MISS J C R A W L E Y , Department
of Geology. A typical card
would read thus: (top line)
Offered/Wanted, place of
starting; (underneath) name
and internal contact point,
(No 'phone calls and No
Long Letters, just the essential
facts on a postcard.
