Fake is funnier than sex
Standing in a dark comer — approp-
riately enough — I was approached by
the Editor who, as brazen as ever,
managed with little subtlety to convey
his w i s h that I review the latest erotica
from S Y L V I A K R I S T E L . T o cut a long
story short, I went to see it and c a n
report thus: it is a beautifully shot film,
as are a l l Franco-Italians films concern-
ing s e x . Unfortunately, but as u s u a l ,
there is no story line, or even plot, as
such. M i s s K r i s t e l , in her second
coming as Emmanuelle, moves e a s i l y
from one screw to another with only a
slight-pause for relief)?)
Relief comes to her in the form of
orgasmic b l i s s induced by acupuncture.
So much then for Emmanuelle 2; sensual,
erotic and s o B O R I N G .
Equally disappointing, but not s o
boring, is Rene Cardona's Survive (x
A B C Shaftesbury Ave and Fulham R d ,
released by EMI). It is a re-creation of
the Andes plane crash of 1972 and the
subsequent ordeal of the survivors. A n
intense film — it starts off dramatically
enough, with its opening sequences of
the crash — although it fails to bring
home the impact of the actions of the
survivors to stay a l i v e . Scenes of
c a n i b a l i s m are treated very tamely; the
camera zooming in only to zoom out
again, leaving one in doubt as to what
has just taken p l a c e . But it did happen;
why, then, the timidity? One can only
conclude that the director's own reticence
that is the root cause.
T h i s is a pity because C a r d o n a ' s
loose grip permeates through t o the
players, some of M e x i c o ' s leading
actors. Left to their own d e v i c e s , they
more or less wander through film in no
way giving it the emotional impact that
it needs. Yet, despite a l l this, Survive is
worth watching; some small part of the
real-life survivors does seep through.
And it asks of the audience, ''Would you
have done t h i s ? '
FOR FAKE, written, directed and
starring O R S O N W E L L E S is about fakery
and the masters of that trade. Leading
the pack is E L M Y R D E H O R Y , celebrated
for his forgeries (or shall we s a y , more
kindly, exact duplicates) of post-
impressionist paintings. So good, in
f a c t , ' t h a t (so called) art experts have
authenticated them. But Welles would
never be content with a story so s i m p l e .
He sidetracks the audience to another
forger - de Hory's biographer, Clifford
Irving.
The connections do not end here,
however. Welles reveals yet another
link between Irving, Hughes and himself
(and there we get the first glimpse of
the charlatan Welles' beginnings as an
actor). Impunity is the forte of a great
forger — and Welles has it, right from
the start. (At 16 — broke, and out of
work — he got his first role as an actor
in Dublin by claiming he was a Broadway
star. H o w ' s that for bare-faced cheek?)
With all this fakery and impostering,
Wei les q u i z z e s :
'How important is an artist's signature
to his work?' How he answers his own
question is the most revealing aspect of
his whole attitude to subject. I leave it
to you to find out what he s a y s .
Fake is a beautiful masterpiece, (or is
it?) with Welles looming through, O J A
K O D A R sensuously floating by, E L M Y R
D E H O R Y playing at being himself, and
C L I F F O R D I R V I N G desperately trying
to maintain a facade of innocence.
H a r l e c h ' s mob were so impressed
with it, they have awarded Fake the
unique certificate M (for masterpiece).
Fake is now showing at the E s s e n t i a l
Cinema, 76 Wardour Street, Soho (439
3657) and the E l e c t r i c Cinema, W11
Slapstick and intimacy
Ralph M c T e l l at IC's Great Hall (last
Saturday)
F i r s t off, congratulations to Ents for
a superb Saturday evening's entertain-
ment! (makes a change from last week —
Ed). They had us in stitches for the first
hour, with an original line-up c a l l e d
Theatre Slapstick — two girls and five
lads with a bewildering conglomeration
of instruments (including a gun and duck
mating c a l l s ! ) which they used well in a
wide range of songs. These ranged from
fairly serious funk rock numbers to dead
funny q u i c k i e s .
Throughout, we had sketches a ' la
Monty Python, mimicry, mime and just
general s i l l y buggers (all well rehearsed,
timed s l a p s t i c k ) . A l l in a l l Slapstick
made everyone have a good time; they
shou Id go far.
Having being put in a good mood, we
all waited, with baited breath, for
Ralph M c T e l l . H e received a lovely
welcome, and got stuck in with 'You
Were My First Song? T h i s was the
second time I've seen this fella l i v e ,
and on both o c c a s i o n s he's managed to
generate an intimate atmosphere almost
immediately. There was absolute
silence — apart from the drunken bum
someone mercifully escorted out — while
he sang. I felt as though he was singing
to (and for) me alone — quite a feat in a
packed Great H a l l .
He played many tracks off his new
L P , including 'It's a Long Way from
Clare to Hdre' (Clare being a place in
Ireland), 'Tequila Sunset' and 'Weather
the Storm'. The latter in tune with the
air conditioner.
Ralph a l s o showed his talents on the
piano ['Naomi' and 'Old Grey Rag' — an
attempt at ragtime he s t i l l hasn't quite
mastered) as well as on guitar. Through-
out a l l the songs there was a depth of
frivolity.
'Streets of London' finished the set;
encores were 'Sweef Mystery' and y e t
another cockney folk song. You'ire the
best M c T e l l , and I think we a l l agreed
that you didn't need to wear brown
trousers after a l l .

Ralph M c T e l l - 'Right Side Up' -
Warner Brothers
Ralph M c T e l l ' s fourth L P for Warner
Brothers is the second version of this
album; the first of these he scrapped
because, whilst technically perfect, he
felt it was not truely his s t y l e .
The ' s e c o n d ' version proves to be a
well-balanced combination of light-
hearted, introspective songs. When I
first heard it, I thought 'oh y e s , just
another bit of background m u s i c ' . But
after a while I found that the emotional
content of the songs genuinely gets to
you — they're sincere, and it c o m e s
across w e l l . G i v e the L P a chance, I
thoroughly recommend it.
The eleven tracks include 'Weather
the Storm' (his new single), as well as
two beautiful songs from a couple of his
contemporaries: Tom Waites' 'San Diego
Serenade' and John Martyn's 'May YQU
Never' (a personal favourite). H i s v
musical ability is well exploited — with
keyboards on 'Naomi' and a good range
of vocal melodies. The mellow mood is
carried over from the first side onto the
second.
I reckon it's an ideal record to curl
up by the fire to, with a hot cup of coffee
and someone n i c e .

A Princely Production
Hamlet at the Olivier, National Theatre
Albert F i n n e y ' s Hamlet, directed
by Peter H a l l has reached its final
resting place in the new O l i v i e r Theatre.
It is nearly twelve months s i n c e its
journey began at the Old V i c , before
being transferred temporarily to the
stage of Lyttelton, the National Theatre's
proscenium stage. At the O l i v i e r we may
now see Mr Finney in a l l h i s glory, no
longer cramped behind the picture-frame.
Suddenly the whole production takes on
an air of authority which I found lacking
before.
How exciting to see Hamlet for the
first time, again! Y e t I felt that, in this
Hamlet, I was seeing the play anew. N o
longer is the Prince the drooling tow-
haired youth driven to the depths of
despair by his inability to make up h i s
mind; here he is dynamic, decided, but
frustrated by an inability to do the deed.
Mr. F i n n e y ' s performance is designed to
extract the maximum of humour from the
play, from the emulation of O s r i c , the
affected courtier, dropping r's a l l over
the place, to the instructions to the
players, where he looks to the audience
for assent.
Apart from bringing the play out onto
the open stage, the Olivier brings the
audience up to the actors' e y e - l e v e l
with extraordinary results. In the ' T o be
or not to be' speech, the eyes c o n t i n -
uously dart around the audience drawing
the whole house into the mind of the
P r i n c e .
Mr Finney is supported by an excellent
c a s t , Susan F l e e t w o o d ' s Ophelia and
Denis Q u i l l e y ' s C l a u d i u s in particular.
The length is somewhat e x c e s s i v e — the
play being split into two acts of
about two and a half hours and one
hour, but the ending is well-worth
waiting for, as are the blue denims
protruding from the bottom of one c l o a k
in Fortinbras' army.
