L a s t week's front page story w a s
written by P a u l Ekpenyong ( R a g
P u b l i c i t y Officer and last year's
F E L I X Editor), and sub-edited by
Duncan Suss and myself. We have had
2Vi, V/2 and 3 years experience respec-
tively in working i n the student media.
Mr Ekpenyong and myself were at the
Carnival Committee meeting, but d i d
not take vociferous part in i t .
Quite a few of the authors to the
letter on page 2 , concerning this
ineeting,did take a very v o c a l , and at
times unproductive part i n the
Committee's proceedings. There w a s
C C U bickering a s described and the
C C U s d i d complain about the lack of
organisation of the R a g procession
as reported in the article.
The F E L I X story w a s factual and
competently written. Whilst appre-
ciating Carnival Committee's problems,
1 only wish that events had made it
unnecessary to write such a story.
But that was up to the people at the
meeting... ^
Regarding R a g Week generally, it
has gone w e l l . The week i s intended
to encourage internal support for R a g .
However, the response from local
residents to the procession s h o u l d
in future be c a p i t a l i s e d on. P e r h a p s
next year events could be arranged to
involve the l o c a l s a s well a s I C
students.
That would certainly give students
and R a g a better image i n Kensington
and Knightsbridge. After the Drink
A P u b Dry exercise i n how to g e t
yourself overpissed I think we need
it. Many experienced Mines drinkers
walked out of the pub, disgusted with
their fellow students' behaviour. A
member of the I C U E x e c conveyed the
same opinion to me; I concur — t h e
evening w a s not a great advert for I C .
NUS Travel
It i s indeed s a d to see N U S T r a v e l
c o l l a p s e . What i s heartening, though,
is that student unions are trying t o
set up a viable alternative travel
service based on the N U S Travel
business channels. Congratulations to
N i c k Brayshaw and Hugh Barrett for
the hard work they're put i n over the
last week to get a London travel
bureau going. Y o u ' l l be able to hear
about this at Thursday's U G M .
Felix Staff
Student papers can never afford to
turn away staff. B e i n g an offset-
litho paper printed on our own
premises, F E L I X needs more staff
than most student papers. Whatever
their level of committment anyone who
wants to work on F E L I X i s welcome.
A t the moment though there i s a dive
need for photographers a n d feature
writers.

'What about the
(permanent)
worker?
Those of you who have been browsing
through the Union Directory, and whose
e y e s , perchance, strayed over the page
headed ' I C U C o u n c i l ' may have wondered
what the members of this motley crew
actually d o . Well, some are reasonably
self-evident(eg Welfare Officer, Academic
Affairs Officer); but what about t h e s e
s i x , here?' 'Permanent Working P a r t y ' .
What do they do?
T h i s inevitable query i s answered
in true IC bullshit fashion by asking
another question, v i z , Who represents
the general interests of ordinary(?)
students on C o u n c i l ? T o whom do you go
if you w i s h to raise a matter not directly
concerned with F i n a n c e , External Affairs
or whatever? Matters like 'Should w e
scrap such-and-such a committee? or
'Why don't we have an Officer for
blanketey-blank?' That, good people, i s
what the P W P (another entry for the ICU
code-book) i s for.

Apology
A p o l o g i e s are i n order to Mines
President P a u l K u r o w s k i . Whilst P a u l
told me 2 weeks ago that he wouldn't
be streaking, a R S M Union meeting
last Tuesday voted unanimously that
he should not streak. T h e meeting
thought the stunt w a s unoriginal a n d
that people would pay to laugh at the
streaker, rather than to support R a g .
I'm sorry the front page cartoon caption
did not convey this properly-
