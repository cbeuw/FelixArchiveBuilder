Injuries and problems
stall IC efforts
Determination and an
attitude of ' L e t ' s fight for
every b a l l ' enabled IC 1st X I
to grab a point in this c l o s e
league match last Wednesday.
The I C team had resolved
to average an earlier defeat by
the strong Queen Mary C o l l e g e .
Nevertheless the odds were
against this since IC had not
played a competitive match for
two and a half weeks — due to
wet weather and a flue
epidemic at Middlesex
H o s p i t a l . Moreover Q M C were
supremely confident following
their defeat of the reigning
league champions, Bedford
C o l l e g e , by 4—1 the previous
week.
The game began at a lively
pace and although Q M C h a d a
slight edge they were refused
control of the game by an I C
side apparently unshaken by
an exploding c o a c h windscreen
on the way to the match. H o w .
ever, mid-way through the first
half Q M C d i d put the ball into
the back of the net only to
have the goal d i s a l l o w e d for
offside,
Panic - stricken goal
Soon atterwards IC t o o k t h e
lead. Steve Bates sent Ian
Huntingdon clear with a
measured through-ball. S t i l l
suffering from mild c o n c u s s i o n
after a c l a s h of heads, Hunt-
ingdon experienced a complete
l o s s of direction, panicked,
and drove the ball past the
keeper and into the net.
Nevertheless, IC did not
hold on to their lead for long.
Q M C ' s equaliser came from a
right wing corner c r o s s that
was powerfully headed into
the net from c l o s e range.
Halft time 1 - 1.
Upper hand to Q
M
C
With the IC team apparently
affected by the half time news
that E n g l a n d had lost 2—0 in
Rome, Q M C proceeded to take
control of the game. IC were
now restricted to rare break-
away attacks one of w h i c h
very nearly brought s u c c e s s
when Terry L i n d o n b l a s t e d
the ball just over the bar.
It w a s not long, though,
before Q M C deservedly took
the lead when one of their
forwards w a s put right through,
leaving keeper K e v A l l e n
with no c h a n c e .
Determined not to a l l o w
Q M C to do the 'double' over
them, I C decided to step up
their work rate and fight for
every b a l l . . T h i s , and a
t a c t i c a l reshuffle w h i c h sent
Andy B a k e r forward out o f
defence, finally p a i d dividends
when with l e s s than 15
minutes left B a k e r sent a
searing right foot shot i n to the
roof of the net to make it 2—2,
and give I C a share of the
points.

Police launch thwarts Senior success
The senior team had rather
a busy time in their first
match of the season (on 13th
November). In the University
of London Winter V H I s they
had to row their semi-final
and then go straight back to
the start for the final against
University College H o s p i t a l .
T h i s w a s really the race
of the day! A p o l i c e launch got
in the w a y on the c o u r s e ! ,
setting up an enormous wash
which hit U C H first, c a u s i n g
them to stop. We were leading
at that point, but the judges
c a l l e d for a re-row. T h i s was
c l o s e l y contested and — would
you believe it — w a s a dead
head.
B a c k for another re-row!
T h i s time the crew felt about
ready to curl up and die — we
rowed hard but lost.
In addition to the Senior
crew, a Junior crew and two
novice teams d i d battle that
day.
The N o v i c e crews had the
first r a c e s , the B crew winning
their first race (after 1 month's
rowing!). T h e ' A ' crew pulled
some spectacular crabs by half
disappearing in a cloud of
spray on their start. Sadly
they couldn't make up the lost
distance.
The ' B ' crew won their
semi final narrowly and then
lost in the final to Queen Mary
C o l l e g e , who had rowed for
over a year. A promising
performance.
The Junior crew rowed two
hard races and won their
semi final and final i n
excellent s t y l e . They made a
bad start in their f i n a l , but
by the halfway point rowed
through the opposition to w i n
by IV2 lengths. T h i s made it
the third consecutive w i n .
P . S . We need c o x s : If y o u are
less than 9!4 stone we're
interested in y o u . It's lots of
fun, ample reward — a good
crowd of people.

Imperial C o l l e g e 1st X V
lost a rather disjointed e n -
counter with K i n g s C o l l e g e
H o s p i t a l 6 ^ 4 on Wednesday
17th November. IC had several
players absent through injury,
and were a l s o without K
L i p s c o m b e (who had a problem
sheet overdue!) and Ian
M a c l a i n , who had a n operatic
society meeting.
IC started w e l l , p l a y i n g
some good rugby. T h e forwards
gave the backs a good share
of p o s s e s s i o n , and A l a n
Gregory scored a good overlap
try. T h e hooker, Sam H e a t h ,
a l i a s the F l y i n g F r i a r , w a s
having an excellent match, and
in addition he encouraged h i s
makeshift front row, with S
A s p d e n , p l a y i n g tight-head
prop. Unfortunately, I C d i d not
translate their territorial
advantage into points, and
allowed K C H to narrow the
Ladies Hockey
defecit to 1 point at by c o n -
ceding a penalty at a ruck.
The n e w scrum half, R o c k y
Hobbs,was having an excellent
game, despite trouble wit h h i s
right arm. T h i s arm w a s
severely strained by having to
lift up A s p d e n ' s gut to put the
ball in the scrum. A s p d e n was
later penalised at a lineout for
tightening h i s corset at the
resultant maul, a n d K C H ' s
kicker made no mistake.
At this stage, M C o t t e r ,
would be flyweight champion
of St H e l e n s , decided the time
was right for a sparring
s e s s i o n . F r o m the ropes, A
Gregory came c l o s e to h i s
second try. T h i s w a s the start
of a concerted college effort to
score; but unfortunately, time
ran out, and K C H ran out rather
lucky winners, while A s p d e n
undid h i s corset and got back
into h i s flower p o t .
Good fight despite human shortage
IC 1 v Barts H o s p i t a l 3
IC L a d i e s Hockey team
turned out for this league
match against Barts two
players short, one of these
being a goal keeper.
Due to this shortage of
players we were * forced to
adopt a rather defensive style
of play throughout. However,
the team put up a good fight and
took the lead with a goal from
D i a n a . T h i s prompted one o f
the opposition to remark' Thank
God there aren't 11 of them'.
IC held on to this lead for
some time until Barts s c o r e d
their first goal and the score
remained 1—1 until almost the
end of the match when Barts
L a c j a s s e
got two quick g o a l s .
The final score w a s a
disappointing end to a match
which could have been much
better i f IC had h a d a f u l l
team.
So far the l a d i e s h o c k e y
team have had their m o s t
s u c c e s s f u l season for some
years. T h e y have played 7
matches wit h 3 w i n s , 3 l o s s e s
and 1 draw.

Imperial College 5
On Saturday 20th November
IC L a c r o s s e C l u b played their
first league fixture of the
season. A s usual I C were two
players short, whereas B e x l e y -
heath had a full team. So it
looked like the match was
going to be a walkover for
B e x l e y . T h i s , however, did not
prove to be the c a s e .
In the first quarter this two
man advantage d i d not prove
d e c i s i v e — at least i n defence.
B e x l e y did in fact have
difficulty in keeping control
of the b a l l , and often lost
p o s s e s s i o n through b a d
passing and c a t c h i n g .
The attack had a different
problem. Whenever IC attacked,
B e x l e y ' s t w o extra p l a y e r s
would come back arid this
meant that every man w a s
marked, l e a v i n g two or three
v Bexleyheath ' A ' 8
players free to go for the man
in p o s s e s s i o n .
Hard graft and a refusal to
loose p o s s e s s i o n meant that
IC were attacking B e x l e y ' s
goal quite often. A t half time
the score w a s 3 a l l .
A t the start of the third
quarter B e x l e y realised that
their best p o l i c y w a s to play
a waiting game. A U they had
to d o w a s keep p o s s e s s i o n
and look for any unmarked man
getting into a good p o s i t i o n
and then play the easy p a s s .
However their finishing w a s
not so good, and the defence
and goalkeeper were able to
break up most of B e x l e y ' s
attacks. I C ' s attack continued
to harass B e x l e y ' s defence
and managed to get a couple
more g o a l s . T h e final score
was 8—5 to B e x l e y h e a t h .
