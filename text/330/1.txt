27th FEBRUARY, 1973
NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
F R E E S No. 330
ENTS TO MERGE
.. .with Dramsoc, Filmsoc, Opsoc, Folk
Club and Jazz Club
Ents is to be merged with Dramsoc, Filmsoc., Folk
Song Club, Jazz Club and the Operatic Society in a
new "Social, Cultural and Amusements Board" (or
S C A B for short) if a proposal to the effect was accep-
ted by Union Council last night.
Included i n the propo-
sals is the new post of
Social Secretary to co-or-
dinate the various com-
mittees. Imperial College
is one of the few colleges
or universities in the
country not to have one
of these already; in many
polytechnics and at least
one university he is sab-
batical.
The Objects of the
Board, given in its draft
constitution, are "the
provision of Entertain-
ment for members of the
Union (and) fullest co-or-
dination and co-operation
of a l l the organisations
represented on the Board
for the benefit of the mem-
bers of the Imperial C o l -
lege U n i o n and other
members of the Imperial
College of Science and
Technology."
Essentially the board
will provide an opportun-
ity for joint operation of
the entertainments activi-
ties of the Union, and it
will also be responsible
for the financing of its
constituent committees
and societies. A block ap-
plication for funds will be
made to the U n i o n Fin-
ance Committee.
Union Council will re-
tain the final veto over
the activities of the Board
however. Except for the
will carry out the same
joint financing, the Board
functions for entertain-
ments as the Publications
Board does for Felix,
Phoenix-, U S K Handbook
and S T O I C .
Criticisms
One of the major rea-
sons for the setting up of
S C A B has been the dis-
satisfaction of many union
members over Ents poli-
cy this year. It has been
frequently argued that
Ents caters for the gener-
al public and students out-
side I C , and tends to ne-
glect the I C U membership.
S C A B is the result of
negotiations between
Paul Wadsworth, Ents
Chairman, and the U n i o n
Exec.

AND NOW FOR SOMETHING
TOTALLY BORING
O N T H U R S D A Y
T H E R E IS A U N I O N
M E E T I N G
U n i o n meetings are held
in the Great H a l l , they
start at 1 p.m. (1300
M C B ) . Y o u are a mem-
ber of I C union so you
can come along too. O n
Thursday you will hear
the proposed candidates
telling you why they de-
serve your vote, you can
ask them questions, take
the piss or cheer them.
The following week
there is voting. Y o u can
vote as well! The votes
are counted and if more
than 25 per cent of the
members have recorded
a preference or an ab-
stention, the person with
the most votes wins, (ab-
stentions are counted as
one person). So you see
you can have a real in-
fluence in Union affairs.
What Felix is saying is.
come to the hustings, lis-
ten to the arguments, and
record a vote—take part!!
Two of the four candi-
dates sent in a joint mani-
festo and it is printed on
page 3 so that you can
think of questions before
Thursday, (The Union
Meeting you'll remember
is on Thursday).
It is very important to
vote in the elections a n d
a student who takes no
part in them really has
no right to criticise the
decisions and policies of
the successful candidate.

Victory for the
People's Republic!
Alasdhair Campbell is t o be next year's editor o f
" F E L I X . " H e was unopposed when nomination pap-
ers were taken down on Friday afternoon.
A second year Physicist, Alasdhair joined the staff
of " F E L I X " earlier this term and has been a regular
contributor to our political columns and has under-
studied E . J . Thribb (17) on more than one occasion.
H e first sprang to fame last year as co-editor o f
"Something," a satirical broadsheet which originally
appeared i n King's College, with David Beeson. now
President-elect of King's. O n l y one issue has appeared
this year; it concentrated on Felix, which it renamed
"Feelsick," and perhaps did more than anything to
make the Editor of Felix actually read the articles
he printed before they went to press, and. indeed, t o
commission some readable ones.
Originaly coming from the West Country, Alasdhair
now hails from the People's Free Republic of Leyton-
stone H i g h R o a d . Major points in his manifesto (which
we don't now have to print) were the continuance of"
politics in " F e l i x " and live action pictures of IC sports-
men thrashing their opponents together with live actioiiL
interviews with sports heroes. Wonder B o y . here we
come . . . .
In the meantime, there are another eight issues to
appear under the current regime.
