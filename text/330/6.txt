Joint Election
Manifesto
FELIX announced its
intention of printing can-
didates' manifestos sev-
eral weeks ago. At the
deadline time, 1700 hrs
on Friday, we had re-
ceived a joint manifesto
from Messrs. Rob Armi-
tage and Simon Allnutt,
and this is reproduced
below. The other candi-
dates did not send in
manifestos.
M y name is Simon A l l -
nutt. I a m a third year
physicist. H a v i n g entered
the college as an engineer
anu changed to physics
means that I have been
here an extra year. R o b
Armitage and myself are
standing with same mani-
festo, given below.
It is our belief that both
sabbatical officers wishing
to attain the same forward
looking objectives, results
in a more active union.
One person, in general,
will have less chance of
seeing the problems the
union will face in the first
place, will not produce as
many ideas on how to
tackle them, and finally, of
carrying them through to
a successful conclusion.
T H E C O L L E G E
C O M M U N I T Y
A s many people as pos-
sible should be involved in
the union's activities at all
levels, producing the ideas
to improve the union for
its members. Contact be-
tween sabbatical officers
and the students for ex-
change of ideas would be
most direct at departmen-
tal level. A s well as this
departments should have
more contact between a l l
students, both post-gradu-
ate and under-graduate,
and staff of all denomina-
tions for a better education
and satisfactory commun-
ity.
The college community
consists of more than just
the academic staff and
students. I n these times
when the students are suf-
fering economically we
are under a moral obliga-
tion to protect the jobs of
workers i n the college who
have dependants to sup-
port.

Why Life Assurance?
C O U R S E S T R U C T U R E
In the present situation
of graduate unemployment
the flexibility of our edu-
cation is of paramount im-
portance.
One of the great benefits
of the course unit system
said to operate in this
College should be the
choice of courses offered
to students, enabling them
to qualify i n a broader
field, whilst allowing spe-
cialisation should the stu-
dent wish it.
W i t h the present job
situation, it is a great ad-
vantage to have a broader
field of interest, even if
this is used temporarily
until the "right j o b " arises.
Does this apply at
, present? N o t satisfactorily.
The recent appointment
of the Academic Director
by the college indicates
that now is the time for
we students to suggest new
course contents where nec-
essary, to make courses
more flexible, more useful.
M a k e no mistake, more
flexibility is an improve-
ment in your chances
when y o u graduate and
start looking for a good
job.

Education should bene-
fit everyone — particu-
larly those being educated.
One of the major points of
the " L i m i t s to G r o w t h " re-
port of the group from
M I T was that to achieve
a stable economy is to use
a much larger percentage
of the gross national prod-
uct for education. In this
context it is our responsi-
bility to press for more ex-
pansion in a l l areas of edu-
cation, to press for equal-
ity of opportunity and
transfer methods between
courses to cater for
changes of interest as the
course progresses. The cut-
backs in the White Paper
entitled "Education: a
Framework for E x p a n -
sion" (the exact opposite
of its contents), are thor-
oughly deplorable.
N.U.S.
W e should be able to
further our aims through
N U S . A s a national union,
its negotiating power, and
The days when an Insurance Manager wept as a
student entered his office are fast disappearing.
True, the odd one or two still want to insure them-
selves to drive a hearse backwards to Basutoland,
but the rapid growth of student interest in life
assurance is the main reason for the new benign
attitude now pervading insurance circles.
A n d the student interest in life assurance really
has grown. A t a conservative estimate T W E N T Y
M I L L I O N P O U N D S of life assurance is bought by
undergraduates each year.
I believe it is not nearly enough.
I know that nearly 9 0 per cent of male under-
graduates w i l l take out a life assurance policy
before they are 2 7 or s o .
I am sure that if they a l l really knew the g o o d
hard e c o n o m i c reasons w h y they should do it n o w
— m o s t of them w o u l d .
Let m e spell these out.
The younger y o u start a policy the cheaper it is
the provision of services
like Travel and Insurance,
are far greater than any
college union can muster
of its own accord. It is an
advantage to be associa-
ted with N U S : if we dis-
agree with its policies,
then we can campaign to
change and improve them.
The N U S has very cum-
bersome machinery, but
I.C. has i n the past been
among the leading expo-
nents of improved pro-
cedures, a trend we would
like to continue. T o bury
our heads in the sand leads
nowhere.
C O M M U N I T Y A C T I O N
Community action is an
area in which this union
is taking the lead in i m -
proving the community as
a whole. A s such, and to-
gether with Eco-action it
should have the greater
financial support from the
union.
O V E R S E A S S T U D E N T S
Twenty per cent of our
students are from overseas
and at present have no
representative o n council.
This must be rectified if
we are to help them effec-
tively to fight any further
increases in their fees, at
present too high anyway.
U N I O N F E E
A t present the Union
receives £8.50 for each
full-time student. With ris-
ing costs (don't say y o u
haven't noticed!) the
Union might soon be as
impoverished as its indi-
vidual members. The per-
capita fee should be i n -
creased to a level so
that expanded program-
mes can take place. It is
not sufficient merely to i n -
crease the U n i o n income
to cover rising costs.
V O T E
If y o u support our aims
outlined here we ask you
to reflect it by voting.
Allnutt for President and
Armitage for secretary.
Please feel free to
approach us on any point
you wish to discuss.
Vote for the other can-
didate if y o u prefer his
views, but vote. This
makes a democratic union.

and the cheaper it stays. Once your rate for the
policy has been agreed it cannot be increased, irre-
spective of inflation or any deterioraton in your
health. A student of 19 w o u l d pay with one leading
company £30.00 per a n n u m for a £4,000 life policy
(the student average). A graduate of 2 7 w o u l d
pay £40.50 per annum for the same thing (if the
rate remained the same in these inflationary times).
Over 2 0 / 3 0 years, the saving runs into hundreds
of pounds.
The next reason w h y c o u l d involve a saving of
thousands of pounds.
The brokers operating in the student field tend
to r e c o m m e n d very g o o d contracts, if only on the
grounds that a student client today is a (rich) gradu-
ate client tomorrow a n d by then he w i l l be more
aware a n d show his appreciation or otherwise by
placing his business with the broker he k n o w s a n d
trusts. M y o w n company write many millions of
pounds worth of business each year from our thou-
sands of graduate clients.
The choice of policy is most important. In 1 9 7 2
the pay out difference on t w o p o l i c i e s — f o r identical
o u t l a y s — w a s £2,949. That is 2,949 reasons for
taking the advice of a g o o d broker. O n c e removed
from university y o u w i l l be up against many hard
selling insurance concerns w h i c h might mean less
good advice.
A g o o d broker w i l l also be able to help y o u to
buy that house y o u will want soon after graduation.
Taking a life policy n o w is only the first step. It
carries no guarantee, but m y o w n company is daily
arranging mortgages for our graduate clients. I
have every reason to believe that several other
insurance brokers in the student field-are also pro-
viding this service.
W o r t h w h i l e policies for students c a n begin from
20p per week a n d if y o u c o u l d forego the o d d pint
or packet of cigarettes it is in your o w n interest to
seriously consider embarking upon your future
financial planning n o w . Consultation w i t h a broker,
preferably one w h o is either a member of the
A s s o c i a t i o n or Corporation of Brokers w o u l d be a
useful starting point, as professional standing car-
ries with it professional responsibility.
