Nemesis
We've been talking a good deal lately about
monev—where to get it, what to spend it on, what
not to spend it on, and—well, it's been mainly
about acquiring the stuff.
But just supposing you've been wise enough to
follow all the advice handed out in these columns,
and have got some cash and spent it wisely.
The next problem is to prevent the Income Tax
man from taking a large part of it back.
You want to know how best to avoid this painful
process. The answer—as it so often is—is to find
good professional advice. A n d that means an
accountant.
So what is an accountant? Do you think imme-
diately of Bob Cratchitt, high-legged stools and quill
pens?
Well, this week, our expert Derek E. Cummings,
takes a look at an important section o f the financial
community.
There are t w o certainties about being born into
this w o r l d these days. O n e is that, sometime, y o u
are going to die. T h e other is that, sometime, you
are going to have to pay taxes.
Both are fairly morbid thoughts a n d at first
glance there is not a great deal y o u c a n d o about
them. Certainly not the first, anyway. B u t the
second, w e l l , perhaps there is something to be done
about that.
In the first place, y o u have to consider h o w to
pay as little tax a s possible, w h i l e r e m a i n i n g — o f
c o u r s e — s t r i c t l y within the iaw. There is a fine dif-
ference between tax avoidance a n d tax evasion.
The major difference is that y o u c a n g o to jail for
evading tax, but avoiding the pain of paying more
than y o u have to is perfectly legitimate.
A n d this, unfortunately, is where the average
taxpayer gets into a kind of A l i c e in W o n d e r l a n d
situation. Unless y o u know the w a y around, it's a
pretty impossible puzzle to try to untangle.
There are s o many laws, so many rules, so many
exceptions, so many legal loopholes that even the
brightest taxpayer will easily become confused,
d e p r e s s e d — a n d probably over-taxed.
M o s t tax experts w i l l cheerfully admit that a
large percentage of British taxpayers are paying
more tax than they s h o u l d .
This usually arises because the individual is un-
aware of certain items for w h i c h he might c l a i m
tax exemption. A n d it's not surprising, when you
consider the w a y the taxation laws are arranged
in this country, under w h i c h the onus is a l w a y s —
a l w a y s — o n the taxpayer to prove his status to the
Inland Revenue.
Y O U fill in your tax returns. Y O U state whatever
claims for tax relief y o u think you are entitled to.
Y O U must prove the claim to the tax m a n . Y O U
have to find out what it is y o u are entitled to.
The Inland Revenue w i l l never advise you, unless
you are prepared to make an issue of it a n d go to
your local Inspector of Taxes a n d pore through the
law with h i m line by line. A n d most people have
neither t h e time nor the inclination to d o that.
W h a t many people d o is to pay a n accountant to
make their tax returns. Their rationale is that a l -
though it costs a little money to put their finances
and tax affairs into the hands of a n accountant, the
likelihood is that he w i l l save them money in the
long r u n , b y reducing their tax bill.
The logic of it is that if the accountant saves
you just one pound more than the bill he charges,
you are ahead of the game.
For anyone w h o objects to paying more tax than
is n e c e s s a r y — a n d that surely includes e v e r y o n e —
it's a n idea worth thinking about.
What, then, is an accountant?
In the first place the title is something of a mis-
nomer. These days, an accountant does a great deal
more than make up accounts. H e has to have a
good knowledge of the theory a n d practice of busi-
ness: he has to be familiar w i t h the workings of the
stock exchange: he must know company law and the
legal involvements of such things: a n d he has to
know all there is to know about taxation.
In short, a good accountant is a kind of mathema-
tical lawyer. A guide a n d interpreter for the layman.
Clearly, such a m a n c a n be of immense value
whenever y o u are involved in any kind of financial
s i t u a t i o n — a s , indeed, w e a l l are from the moment
we start earning money a n d paying taxes on it.
Of course, if a n d when the time comes, y o u
will need to choose a g o o d accountant. T h e most
reliable guide to this is to look for a chartered
accountant, a n d the post-nominal initials ' A . C . A . ' .
T h i s indicates that the name o n the plate belongs
to a m a n w h o has passed the searching examina-
tions set by the Institute of Chartered Accountants.
Naturally, these qualifications will not necessarily
exclude fools a n d knaves, but it is a worthwhile
indicator. After a l l , anyone at a l l c a n call himself
an accountant a n d set up in business with no
qualifications whatever.
A n d h o w does a n accountant himself define his
w o r k ? I talked to a chartered accountant about it.
Like doctors, accountants are forbidden by their
code of conduct to advertise, so his remarks must
remain anonymous.
"I suppose the best definition of a n accountant's
w o r k , " said he w h o shall be nameless, " i s to say
that w e offer a translation service. S o m u c h of the
law relating to business a n d taxation is quite i n -
comprehensible to the layman that without expert
interpretation he has no chance of understanding
it.
"I w o u l d agree that vast numbers of people d o
pay more income tax, for example, than they really
need to. In most cases, it amounts to shillings a n d
it w o u l d therefore not be worth paying pounds to
c o m e to one of us to correct the assessment.
" B u t the thing is that unless y o u are familiar
w i t h t h e l a w relating to taxation, y o u c a n never be
sure what it is y o u are entitled to c l a i m for. There
CONGRATULATIONS
I'd like to offer m y congratulations to those wonder-
ful crusaders who removed a l l those unsightly publicity
notices around college advertising the national grants
demonstration. It was an utter disgrace that students
should display notices advertising a demonstration on
such an unworthy cause as student grants. It was good
to survey the thoroughness with which every single
poster was disposed of from their places of erection,
including student noticeboards.
The most clever part of it was the w a y i n which
the authorities disclaimed a l l knowledge of having re-
moved them and their method of confusing students
as to where they were allowed-to put up notices and
who was pulling them down.
A t least some people have got the strength of mind
to stand up to student propaganda; w h o knows, one
day students might even get organised and begin to
think . . . or even start discussing P O L I T I C S (ghastly
word). Obviously we can't tolerate such things: after
all, think of the effect that silly student pranks like
demonstrations could have o n the cutback i n educa-
tion expenditure. W e musn't have them disturbing the
peace just because they don't think their grant is high
enough, let alone rationalisations or refectory price i n -
creases (such topics are, after a l l , way above their
heads).

P.S. I hope M r . Seaford will give the male cleaners
a bonus for the extra work involved (including danger
money for going u p ladders to a height of 20 feet or
more) for taking down the posters rather than getting
in contact with the individuals involved who (horrible
blokes) actually gave an undertaking to remove the
posters o n Wednesday after the demonstration. A few
more students might have read those bills; that would
have been a bit silly.
P.P.S. W h y not censor the student notice boards all
of the time, not just some of it?

is no provision for the Inland Revenue to point out
things like that to the taxpayer. It is the taxpayer's
own responsibility to find out. A n d that takes a good
deal more dedication than most people are pre-
pared for. O n the other hand, accountants are
trained to look for such items.
" A n d there is one other thing w h i c h is well
worth pointing out to anyone contemplating the
idea of consulting a n accountant, a n d that is not
to leave it too late. If, for example, y o u think you
are being over-taxed, take professional advice as
soon as y o u c a n , otherwise it c a n be a long a n d
complicated business. Remember, the tax man does
not have to prove he is right, y o u have to prove
he is wrong.
" O f course, personal taxes are far from being
the most important element in o u r professional
lives. Like legal men, w e have to know a good deal
about most things in life. After a l l , when a m a n
comes'to y o u to lay his financial affairs before your
eyes, he's s h o w i n g y o u a lot of himself, w h i c h
means that an accountant is deeply a n d personally
involved in a w i d e range of men's doings.
" O d d l y enough, a lot of the story-book image
of accountancy still clings. M a n y people still see
us sitting on high stools, adding columns of figures
and entering them in ledgers with quill pens. But,
like many such images, it is a grotesquely inaccur-
ate one.
" W e have to be a u fait with the most modern
business methods such as computers, cost-effective-
ness programmes, company organisation a n d the
whole mass of l a w relating to monetary matters.
But it a l l boils d o w n to one thing, really. M a k i n g
money work to the best possible advantage of the
client while staying within the l a w . "
