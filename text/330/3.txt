65,000 STUDENTS ON THE STREET
Staff Reporter
Last Wednesday accor-
ding to the N U S 65,000
students marched, i n 7
regional centres around
the country, i n protest
demanding a living grant.
In London 15,000 stu-
dents from the southern
region led by the I C con-
tingent marched from
Malet St. to the D E S
across Waterloo bridge.
The wet and miserable
weather which continued
for most of the afternoon
dampened them but not
their enthusiasm i n the
fight for higher grants.
In Malet St. the police
split the demo into two
sections and the first half
led by I C set off for the
D E S with the second half
200 yards behind. B y the
A l d w y c h the two halves
had joined up and contin-
ued to the D E S , chanting
slogans and handing out
leaflets to passers-by. A t
the D E S the demo went to
an area on the south bank
to listen to speakers from
the N U S and various
trade unions.
A R R E S T
The first half of the
demo had hardly gone
200 yards from Malet St.
when a police inspector
threatened to arrest the
whole demo unless they
walked five abreast. N o t
having a megaphone he
went unnoticed and the
students continued to fill
their lane as before.
R o u n d the corner out
of sight of Malet St. I
saw six policemen dis-
guised as short-haired
pseudo trendy students
step out of a police van
and join the march, they
were easily recognisable
however as they were the
only people on the march
holding large black regu-
lation police umbrellas.
N O N - A R R I V A L
A m o n g the speakers
who were going to address
the students was R o y Hat-
tersley (Labour M P ) . H e
was being driven to the
south bank to make his
speech when he saw some
students leaving the area,
informed sources told me,
assuming the rally to be
over he turned round and
left for St. Pancras to
catch a train out of L o n -
don. N o representative
from the Labour Party
turned up.
I N A U D I B L E
Unfortunately the Pub-
lic Address system ob-
tained by the N U S had
had its speakers spread
round the perimeter,
which was fine for the
people spread round the
perimeter, but those near-
est the speaker's platform
could not hear any of the
speeches. The students
nearest the platform frus-
trated at not hearing any-
thing started to heckle,
demanding a march o n
Parliament and death to
fascist N U S bureaucrats.
Judy Cotter (President
U L I E S A ) said that they
couldn't do that as it was
not on the agenda.
S C U F F L E S
A cameraman from
A B C news got up on the
speakers' platform and
filmed a cameraman from
the Beeb who was stand-
ing near the platform
filming the A B C news
cameraman filming him.
This accounts for the scar-
city of film of the demo
on the television news that
night — 10 seconds was
devoted to it by the B B C .
Some demonstrators near
the platform tried to pull
out a wire powering the
camera but were re-
strained by others. Soon,
owing to lack of inspira-
tion from the inaudible
speeches, students started
to drift away and the
demo dispersed remark-
ably quickly.
S U M S W R O N G
Although the N U S
claimed a turn-out of
15,000, the police estimate
was 7,000 and this was
echoed by the television
news, and all national
dailies the morning after,
except the Guardian
which printed both fig-
ures. Felix abacus opera-
tors counted 12,000, of
which 500 were from IC.
It is the police that
choose the route the demo
will follow and the final
place of the rally. They
assured us that the area
on the south bank where
the rally took place could
hold 20,000 and it was
packed, all bar a small
area behind the speaker's
platform.
The turn-out from Sus-
sex university was disap-
pointing — only 20 peo-
ple, but the contingents
from polys and non-
university colleges repre-
sented a far bigger per-
centage than from IC.
Last year (in fine weather)
800 people from TC took
part in that anti-Thatcher/
Gilbert Longden registra-
tion of student unions
demo and that bill was
postponed. Don't forget
the N U S National D a y of
Action for the Grants
Campaign on March 14th
— be sure to give it your
support or students may
not escape this time.

Editorial
10 per cent of students showed their solidarity at W e d n e s -
day's demonstration. A s a show of solidarity it was
pathetic and unconvincing. A s a vehicle for canvassing
public support it failed miserably, at least partly through the
lack of people along the chosen route. It would be pure
pipe-dreaming to imagine that it had any effect on the
Government's attitude.
Yet the aims of the Grants C a m p a i g n are good and justi-
fiable. No student can deny that, any more than a properly-
informed public c o u l d .
T h e main need now is for public sympathy. T h e public
have been led to believe that students are (and you've heard
it all before) a bunch of long-haired, shoddily-dressed lay-
abouts, who spend their time drinking, s m o k i n g pot and
engaging in orgies. However m u c h you may believe that
picture to be true, the public needs to be told of the other
side of a student's life — • studying (yes, studying) and
surviving. N o demonstration will do that. For not only
are the public bored with demonstrations, but so are students
(witness the 10 per cent turnout).
Yet demonstrations are just about the only public rela-
tions exercise (other than strikes) that the N U S and the rest
of the student leadership can conceive of. H i g h IQ's don't
seem to breed originality. A l l students fall in the top 5 per
cent of the population, intelligence-wise.
W e need to s h o w our intelligence by having an intelligent
and original campaign — not by resorting to the pointless
methods of the trades unions.
So let's raise a cheer for the Scottish region of the N U S —
Britain's only functioning N U S area — who d e c i d e d that
d e m o s were no good weeks ago. Instead of having a march
and rally last W e d n e s d a y , like all the other areas, they e m -
barked on a mass public education campaign.
T h e y called for 4 0 0 articulate students from all over
Scotland to c o m e to Edinburgh on W e d n e s d a y to be fully
briefed on the Grants C a m p a i g n , then to be turned loose on
Prince's Street (Edinburgh's equivalent of Oxford Street) to
go up and talk to passers-by about it. In the event, 1,200
students turned up, vast numbers of the public eventually
expressed their support, and they got the best Press of any
of the 11 regional " c e n t r e s of activity".
Surely this is the sort of action that students should be
taking. Responsible and intelligent action. A n d it's the
sort of thing we should be doing on the Day of A c t i o n
which take's place a fortnight tomorrow.
Now that Oxford Street is nearly a pedestrian precinct,
it's idealy suited to the purpose. It's one hell of a sight
better idea than going on strike, which is the N U S line . . .
all that'll get us is a bad Press and a worse public reaction.
W e ' r e students because we've got brains — let's use
them!

Last week's grant demonstrations were a very substantial
success. Over 10 per cent of the N U S membership were
involved in them. T h i s represents by far the biggest national
action ever taken by students — in s o m e regional centres
the turnout was three times that of last year over the " a u t o -
n o m y " issue. In organising the London demo, we had hoped
for 10,000. With the rain and c o l d weather, prospects did
not look too good on the day. In fact, well over 15,000
marched — the colleges of education and F E colleges being
particularly strong. T h e mass media made themselves
rather ridiculous by saying 7,000 ( B B C & ITN News) right
up to the late night news on B B C 2 which (after a recount?)
suddenly d e c i d e d on 15,0001 But we can thank the media
for the excellent coverage of the IC contingent!
G O V E R N M E N T R E A C T I O N
T h e question remains. What will the Tories do about all
those tens of thousands of unruly students shouting nasty
things at their windows, withholding their rents or having
catering boycotts? After the meeting between N U S and the
Government on M a r c h 1st we should be a bit clearer. Their
most likely reaction will be to c o n c e d e something but d o it
in such a way as to divide the student movement.
For instance, they could introduce subsidies for halls and
refectories. T h e idea would be that students in hall would
stop the rent strike campaign, leaving the rest in the lurch
facing increasing rents in private a c c o m m o d a t i o n on the
present grant. Or they c o u l d give everybody a small in-
crease but do nothing about the basic injusticies involved
in the discretionary award system with the hope of buying
off the majority of students with small carrots. If students
are in a frame of m i n d which allows them to be divided
from each other there are an unlimited variety of tactics
which the Government could use.
T H E M A R C H 14th D A Y O F A C T I O N
If the Tories reject our claim out of hand, or attempt
to divide the N U S , there must be solid united reaction
from every college in the country.
T h e Grants Campaign co-ordinating committee are there-
fore calling for a National Strike on M a r c h 14th with the
aim of closing down totally the higher education system for
one day.
T h i s is the first E V E R national strike called by N U S and
if we are serious about defending the living standards of
both ourselves and future generations of students it must
be a success. It should not be seen as similar to an indus-
trial strike — the effect on the e c o n o m y is insignificant. It
is, however, probably the most effective form" of demonstrat-
ing our unity and determination.
Organising the strike will require a large number of acti-
vists and widespread support from the ordinary union m e m -
bers. If it is a success, the government will know that, given
an issue on which students feel strongly enough, we're cap-
able of organising the same again. in other words, by
striking on M a r c h 14th we are saying to the G c w n m e n t
that unless they maintain our living standards and give all
students the full grant they cannot expect anything but
continual trouble in higher education.
HOW MUCH SHOULD
YOU EARN ?
L a s t w e e k I b o u g h t n o t h i n g out of the o r d i n a r y , I w e n t
o n n o e n o r m o u s s p e n d i n g s p r e e and I didn't travel anywhere
a g r e a t d i s t a n c e f r o m here. Nevertheless, I managed to
o v e r s p e n d o n m y grant by n e a r l y 2 0 per cent. I'll a g r e e that
I w a s n ' t being particularly careful, but I wasn't b e i n g i n the
least extravagant and it was quite a s h o c k to d i s c o v e r just
how m u c h I had spent.
A t least this year I'm relatively l u c k y ; I'm l i v i n g in h a l l .
W h e n I go out into the big w i d e world of privately owned
a c c o m m o d a t i o n I'll have to pay at least £6 a w e e k merely
to have a roof over my head. I'll also have to pay t h i s for
3 9 weeks a year so that the room will be held over the
Easter and Christmas vacations. If you add in the cost of
feeding myself during term it's quite obvious that the
notional element of £ 2 7 5 for board and lodgings in the
grant is hopelessly inadequate.
Well, why don't I get a job? Yes, I suppose that's quite
feasible and probably a good idea for the first year. But
what about the s e c o n d and third years? Only the geniuses
will find that they don't need to study for a considerable
period of the vacation. Anyway, I'm already doing a job.
I'm studying to become a more useful member of society
so why should I have to take a s e c o n d job in order to sur-
vive? I think I deserve a better deal than I'm getting at
the moment.
I don't suppose, however, that James Fenner w o u l d agree
with me. He thinks that when you deserve a pay rise you
get it without having to ask. O n that basis, I don't deserve
a higher grant because it hasn't been offered u n d e m a n d e d .
M a y b e if he had to live on what I do at the moment he
might admit he could be wrong.
Mr. Fenner stated in his letter last week that he " w o u l d
like to debunk the attitude of the lunatic left that students
are workers". I would very much like to know what he c o n -
siders students to be if they are not workers. It seems to
me that, like all other workers, they are selling their ability
to execute particular tasks. That they are being trained
does not alter this in the least. Apprentices are considered
by their employers to be employed. T h e y do not receive the
full rate for the job because they are not fully trained, but
then it could not be said that students receive anything like
the full rate for the sort of jobs they will do when they
finish their studies. Undoubtedly, it will be argued that the
courses run here are not necessarily vocational and thus this
argument cannot be applied to us. W h y then is it that
employers in many fields trample all over each other to
persuade IC graduates to work for them. ( ? — E d . ) . T h e y ,
at least, must believe that the studies undertaken h e r e offer
something that cannot be obtained elsewhere.
M r . Fenner seems to b e even further out of t o u c h with
the s o r t of a v e r a g e s a l a r y y o u n g graduates receive. I d o n ' t
t h i n k t h a t it c a n p o s s i b l y b e c o n s i d e r e d normal to t r i p l e o n e ' s
salary in a period of five years. O n that basis Mr. Fenner's
annual salary when he retires should be in the region of
£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and there a r e n ' t v e r y many people w h o earn
that m u c h . I think also t h a t M r . Fenner may h a v e b e e n
l e s s than h o n e s t a b o u t t h e origin of the money he earned.
H e d o e s n o t s t a t e in h i s letter that he is in fact A m e r i c a n ,
a n d t h a t he w a s not working in this country w h e n he was
e a r n i n g t h e s e e n o r m o u s salaries. I have been t o l d that,
in t h e c o u n t r y w h e r e h e was working, the average p a y for
the j o b he w a s d o i n g is much greater than it is h e r e .
B y t h e w a y , I g u e s s y o u a l l think I'm a member of t h e s o -
c a l l e d " l u n a t i c left". W e l l , I'm not; and, if y o u d o n ' t b e l i e v e
me, y o u c a n a s k a n y b o d y w h o m Mr. Fenner c o n s i d e r s be-
l o n g s to t h a t f a c t i o n .

Probably the most important thing about M a r c h 14th is that
we should not all stay in our beds. There will be a national
lobby of Parliament by delegates from all colleges on that
day. A teach-in, alternative classes, discussion on wider
education issues, on the White Paper on Education, public
leaf letting, publicity stunts — given numbers and imagina-
tion we can make a big public impact, stimulate students to
think more deeply about education and in general make it a
real day of action and not just a " S l e e p - I n " .
