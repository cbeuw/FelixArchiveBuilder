hockey Centrepoint
Last Sunday out at Harlington and in the surround-
ing pubs, the annual piss-up with the Poachers took
place. The game that preceded this was won by the
Poachers 2—1 after they were a goal down at half-
time.
The game was extremely scrappy and after a hard
night I missed most of what happened — especially
their two goals — so I'll end this report by thanking
W.B., R o n (he is the pissed one), R i c h and Dave for
keeping the I.C. flag flying in the surrounding pubs.
On the previous day the 1st X I played their penul-
timate league match against Smiths and lost 3—0. The
only comment about this match that reached me was
that it wasn't worth reporting. O n the same day, the
never reported 2nd X I entertained G.W.R. l i s and won
1—0.
Saturday's brilliant sunshine brought out the best
in the 3rd X I players, who proceeded to record their
third win of the season. In order to give G . W . R . I l l s
a chance, I.C. turned up with only nine men.
The first half was fairly even with both sides creat-
ing chances, but neither getting on top. G . W . R . took
the lead mid-way through this half with a simple goal
following a bad defensive mistake. The second half
was completely different. Despite G.W.R's. two man
advantage, I.C. completely dominated the game. Using
their superior fitness (thanks to J.J.?) I.C. forced the
pace and eventually scored a very scrambled goal from
a goalmouth melee. Russ Eason was the scorer. The
same player scored the winner a few minutes later
when he beat three players before putting the ball
into the empty net. A t this stage G . W . R . were unable
to raise their game and I.C. eventually emerged the
comfortable winners.
Team:- R. Bateman; D. M u r c h , C. Scott; J . Heffer,
Julie, R. Critchley; W. Biggin, J . Preston, R. Eason.
A s mentioned earlier M r . Eason scored twice during
the match, his hat-trick being completed later that
same evening.
W i l l all members please note that the annual dinner
will take place on Monday, M a r c h 19th. The price for
this nosh-up which will be followed by a grand drink-
ing session in 414, is at the moment, set at £2.40. F o r
all of those who are bringing guests of the opposite
sex, and who isn't, a double ticket is settling down at
£4.50.
r o w i n g
Saturday the 10th February saw the I.C. 1st V I I I
in action for the first time this year. The occasion was
the London R o w i n g C l u b Colleges Regatta. Although,
as its name suggests, this is essentially a colleges event,
L o n d o n R o w i n g C l u b decided to enter two crews. One
of which was their domestic 1st V I I I , only lacking
the heavyweights of their continental regatta Grand
V I I I .
The first heat saw I.C. caught in a hailstorm while
waiting on the start, as a result of which their new
blue boat club sweat shirts spent the rest of the day in
the drying room and I.C. had to revert to their prac-
tice tops for the rest of the regatta. Q.M.C., the cause
of the delay, only had 7 men and had had to pick up a
spare man from L o n d o n Rowing Club. In fact, they
needn't have bothered, as they, along with L o n d o n
R.C. II were left standing by I.C's. very powerful start.
I.C. were in fact clear of both crews in the first twenty
strokes. Although I.C. did not row particularly well
for the rest of the race they beat L o n d o n by about 4
lengths and Q . M . C . by 7 lengths.
In the Semi-Final I.C. met Churchill College, C a m -
bridge. In rough water I.C. went clear in the first min-
ute and finally won by 4 lengths.
Although I.C. had won all their heats easily they
never rowed particularly well together and it was with
some doubts that they went into the final against
London R . C .
I.C's. powerful start gave them.f length in the first
minute but they did not settle together i n the middle
of the race and could not go clear. Their lack of
cohesion in the rough water coupled with the fact that
they had had one more race than London, began to
tell even on this very fit crew. I n the closing stages
London rowed through f.C. to win by 1 length.
The result is very promising indeed for the boat
club. A l l the other college crews were well beaten, and
the very next day the same L o n d o n crew were easily
held over 7. mins. Even more promising have been some
of the other practice outings, i n which I.C. have bea-
ten most of the other tideway clubs. The highlights of
the practice rows were I.C's. defeat of Isis (the Oxford
university 2nd V I I I , thought by many to be very good
this year) by 1/3 length over 2 mins., and the defeat
of Tyrian, the U . L . 2nd V I I I by 2 lengths over a
3 min. row.
The indications are that this could be one of the
boat clubs best seasons for many years.
C E N T R E P O I N T began
as an experiment on De-
cember 16th, 1 9 6 9 , in
the d i s u s e d basement of
St. A n n e ' s House, Soho,
w h o s e front door is in
Dean Street, next to the
bomb site w h i c h was
once St. A n n e ' s C h u r c h .
The entrance to Centre-
point is in Shaftesbury
Avenue, through s o m e
romantic iron gates, and
the decaying churchyard,
passed u n n o t i c e d by
thousands of people ev-
ery day. It began here,
right in the heart of the
W e s t End (the centre
point) because this was
where a number of
groups were w o r k i n g , es-
pecially w i t h drug abus-
ers. A m o n g them was
Father Kenneth Leach at
St. A n n e s ' , trying to help
people w h o are very sev-
3relly disturbed, many ir-
reparably so. He w a t c h -
ed young people d r a w n
to the W e s t E n d like
moths to a candle, a l -
most inevitably to be
burnt, a n d he longed to
find some way of saving
some of them from the
familiar syndrome: no
money, nowhere to
sleep, " v a g r a n c y " , petty
crime, drugs a n d the
prostitution of both boys
and girls.
The e x p e r i m e n t — i n i t -
ially for three m o n t h s —
a i m e d to provide new-
comers with first a i d : a
place to sleep, some-
thing to eat, someone to
talk to, and advice es-
pecially about how to
find work and a c c o m m o -
dation. It hoped to give
a few of them a chance
to settle in London w i t h -
out being d a m a g e d by
it, or to go home again,
or to do whatever it was
t h a t — b y the time they
reached C e n t r e p o i n t —
they really wanted to do.
Centrepoint is unique
in London in providing
emergency a c c o m m o d a -
tion completely free,
every night of the year.
Fifteen to twenty young
people have c o m e in
every night and there
have been some fifteen
thousand a d m i s s i o n s
since the centre opened.
It now has a full time
professional social work-
er as a d i r e c t o r — D a v i d
N a i r n — b u t , other than
that, it is entirely staffed
by volunteers. Imperial
College C a t h o l i c Society
send two volunteers ev-
ery n i g h t — t h e y work on
a fortnightly r o t a — t o
work there, and organ-
ised a long sponsored
walk through the Sussex
W e a l d on Saturday. T h e
aim was to raise money
for Centrepoint House, a
short term hostel the or-
ganisation is to set up at
Baron's Court. It w i l l
house fourteen residents
and offer those w h o use
it a supportive address
whilst they work a n d find
other a c c o m m o d a t i o n
during their non-working
hours. The average ex-
pected length of stay
w i l l be a fortnight. U n -
fortunately no space was
available for this article
in our last issue, so we
c o u l d not urge y o u to
sponsor a walker. Nev-
theless, Centrepoint still
needs d o n a t i o n s — i n a l l ,
they need £10,000. If
you c a n , send a few
pence. M o r e details can
be obtained from J o s e p h

w h o is organising the
Cathsoc contingent to
Centrepoint.

If you were by the A l -
bert M e m o r i a l on Satur-
day afternoon, you may
have wondered at the
emergence of s o m e 5 0 0
betracksuited p e o p l e
from the U n i o n . The oc-
casion for all this activ-
ity w a s the 25th H y d e
Park Road Relay organ-
ised in time-honoured
(and sometimes cursed)
tradition by Imperial C o l -
lege in its manifestation
as the C r o s s Country
C l u b in general, and
Steve W e b b , Pete J o h n -
son, Neil B o a g a n d R o b
Parker in particular.
M a n y thanks to all
those w h o braved the
weather (the o d d snow-
flake or two) to help on
the day: the timekeepers
and judges, the markers
(in particular, w e ' v e
been asked to mention
the " l o v e l y little lady

and without w h o m . . .
A t 3 o'clock by the
traditional lamp - post,
w h o s e number I've for-
gotten. Lord Penney,
a r m e d w i t h the A C C
W e b l e y (which worked),
unleashed a straining
pack of s o m e 8 0 runners
d o w n Rotten R o w a n d
around the 3 mile (al-
most) course. First back
was J . Reade of Ports-
mouth Poly, but that
glory d i d n ' t last long,
slipping to s e c o n d on the
next lap a n d later to
26th.
Borough Road College
managed to w i n both the
cups this year, instead
of just their usual one
(we only hope w e ' l l see
the Lady Roderick Hill
cup again!), in a time of
8 5 min 3 0 sec. B i r m i n g -
ham University, winners
for the past two years,
were third, m o v i n g up
s l o w l y from 2 4 t h after
the first lap. The fastest
lap was run by A n d y M c -
Kean of Edinburgh Uni-
versity in 13 m i n , 3 0
sec, 3 seconds short of
the lap record (his left
leg was not m u c h slow-
er).
Of course the result
you're all w a i t i n g for is
that of I C . W e were 3 9 t h .
Rob A l l i n s o n started us
off well at 5 3 r d in 15
min 29 sec, a n d this
position was consolidat-
ed by Stuart Littlewood
(15:56) a n d Dave Payne
( 1 6 : 3 2 ) . T h e effect, how-
ever was somewhat
spoiled by J o e Keating,
who picked up 14 places
in a time of 14 min 37
sec, returning so quickly
that he was the cause of
a hurried disrobement
by our next runner Paul
Clarke, w h o d i d 15 min
49 sec. Our last runner
was Rob Parker, and
least said, soonest mend-
ed. The overall time was
9 4 min 59 sec.
After the race Lady
Penney was kind enough
to present the medals to
the w i n n i n g teams a n d
individuals, a n d Steve
W e b b made a speech
and got it right.
A n d so, as the U n i o n
sank once more, for an-
other year, into its
peaceful slumber, a
group of Belgian runners
led by Foreign Teams
organiser Pete J o h n s o n
(none other) joined the
IC T e a m and half the
other U K colleges in a
certain house of refresh-
ment in South Kensing-
ton. H n n n ! (that's French
but I guess those B e l -
gians u n d e r s t a n d
French).
