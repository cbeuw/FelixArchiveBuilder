GET WELL
SOON
Dear Sir,
It has been drawn to my
attention that one of the
messengers of this college
has been in hospital now for
nearly three weeks, after
being the victim of a vicious
attack at his home. He is
Mr. George Butler, the mes-
senger from Aero. I am
writing this letter not only
to let more people know why
he has not been at work re-
cently, but more importantly
"> express the wishes of so
many students that he will
>*v}£e a full and quick re-
fivery.
It is as a result of a des-
picable act of violence that
Mr. Butler is in hospital.
Someone threw a brick into
his face damaging his sight.
Many of the messengers
with whom he works have
been to see him and so have
some of the students who
have got to know him. I
think it is important now to
let as many people as pos-
sible know that students do
care about the people who
help the departments so
•*nch.
Yours,
ADRIAN E. SMITH.
P.S.: This college runs a
large personnel department
to deal with their employees.
Since they did not even know
about this incident, I am
forced to wonder whether
they spend their time deal-
ing with all the individuals
they employ or simply trying
to force through productivity
deals.

Sit,
Last week David Hum-
phreys, Chairman of the
Methodist Society, strongly
disputed Mr. Campbell's sug-
gestion that "God is a crutch
for people who can't come
to terms with objective rea-
lity".
But it is true that many
people cannot come to terms
with objective reality. God
is a crutch for these people,
just as surely if it is religion
as if is is sex, money or alco-
hol. And an escape from
reality comes as surely to the
religious type who expects
all to be well in the end as
to the drug taker who finds
a reality only when he is
high or the Communist who
expects a golden age to fol-
low revolution.
Let us make no mistake,
however, by failing to recog-
nise that these gods are not
the God of the bible, who
revealed himself in objective
reality in the person of Jesus
Christ who went about doing
good. And we find that this
God did something about the
reality of our universal ten-
dency to do what we know is
wrong.
When one looks at some
of these realities one has to
agree with Mr. Humphreys.
In Jesus Christ is the only
true answer to living a life
of reality.
For those interested rele-
vant literature (some free)
is available from the Chris-
tion Union bookstall, Thurs-
day lunchtimes in the JCR.
Yours sincerely,
R O B E R T . J . H I G G I N S O N .

POVERTY
STRICKEN
Sit.
I would be very interested
in learning for whom Mr.
Fenner was working at a
£4,750 rate, and whether
this was a monthly or an-
nual salaty, as I need a bit of
cash myself?
Surely it couldn't have
been for reviewing plays?
Youts faithfully
and poverty-stricken,

NO WAGE
INCREASES
Sir,
When I first came to work
in IC, I was informed that
the College had an excellent
reputation in the world of
Science and Technology.
Since the entrance require-
ments were also rather high,
I assumed that all the stu-
dents were of a reasonable
level of intelligence.
Last week's "Felix" had
one glowing example to the
contrary, J. H. Fenner's let-
ter. Never have I seen such
ridiculous words in print!
His advocacy of the typical
Tory laissez-faire ideology
was not even cleverly put for-
ward in the way of most
bright-eyed Tories.
It would be quite easy to
present notional figures on
the frequency of wage in-
creases (salaries to you, Mr.
Fenner), including figures
for that small minority of
degree holders. But as Felix
concerns itself with IC it is
to this area that I will res-
trict myself.
Imperial College messen-
gers, male cleaners, refectory
staff, female cleaners and
laboratory staff have not re-
ceived any wage increase
since December 1st 1971.
IC barmen and security
guards have waited a simi-
lar length of time, and if
one were to look at the cleri-
cal staff situation it might be
even worse. Of course, as
Mr. Fenner has such faith
in the idea of meritocracy,
he might as well claim that
the above group of workers
do not merit any increase.
Well, besides simple things
such as the thousands of
pounds saved as a result of
staff reductions and in-
creased productivity there is
another slight matter to be
considered, i.e., the rise in
the cost of living since 1971.
Or doesn't that count, Mr.
Fenner?
May I suggest, Mr. Fen-
ner, that you report imme-
diately to your parents and
primary school so as to
undergo the complete socia-
lisation and education pro-
cess again, as something ob-
viously went wrong last
time.
Yours sincerely,
A. J. O'BRIEN,
Messenger and
NUPE shop steward.

INTERESTING
LETTER
Sir,
I found David Humphteys
letter in FELIX last week in-
teresting, as it exhibits many
of the elements of confused
bourgeois religious ideology
prevalent in students today.
Unfortunately he has ne-
gated the first half of his
letter by ignoring the adjec-
tive "objective" in the
phrase "objective reality" in
my poem of the week be-
fore. I am not in the habit
of adding superfluous modi-
fiers to my lines for the sake
of scansion alone. In that
one word lay the crux of my
philosophical argument: in
order not to fall into the so-
phist and solipsist contradic-
tions inherent in all idealist
philosophies, which include
the theistic religions, one
must assume the existence of
objective reality. In other
words, that there exists mat-
ter outside of mind, this im-
plies that mind is but the
highest stage of matter and
has no spiritual existence.
(For further substantiation I
refer Mr. Humphreys to
"Materialism and Empirio-
Criticism" by V. I. Lenin).
Those who turn to alco-
hol and drugs are living proof
of how consciousness is very
much secondary to reality.
These people, finding the
reality of life in present-day
society unbearable, have no
recourse but to resort to es-
capism—they are not search-
ing for reality, Mr. Hum-
phreys, but retreating from
its contradictions.
To try and differentiate be-
tween changing social struc-
ture and changing people is
impossible, for any change in
one is a change in the other-
it is clear that a social struc-
ture cannot be imposed by
anyone outside society. Jesus
Christ was a revolutionary of
his time, though in his time
he had almost no effect —
his death is recorded in the
annals of the era as that of
just another troublemaker.
It was not until the 4th cen-
tury A.D. that Constantine,
Emperor of Rome, needing a
unifying structure to hold to-
gether his crumbling empire,
adopted Christianity. Its
elements of rigid hierarchy
and autocratic rule from
above made it the perfect
philosophy of life, tailor-
made as it indeed was, to
keep the ruling class and
him in particular in power,
and that oppressed class of
the time in its place.
This also accounts for re-
ligions of a similar structure
being associated with all
class-based societies and the
continuing popularity of
Christianity in Britain today.
This is further borne out by
the fact that whenever a
state has arisen out of
class conflict by the fact
that whenever a state has
arisen out of class conflict,
as it must to ensure the con-
tinuing power of the ruling
class, one sees the decay of
pantheistic and other poly-
theistic religions and the
adoption of a monotheistic
religion promoted by the rul-
ing class of the time.
