their Bottle match and so need as
much practice as possible, the C&G
and the RCS are the perfect opponents
to play. Similarly the RCS need their
practice for the Oxford game and as for
the Guilds, well they just like playing a
game of glamorous rugby before retir-
ing to the bar. Before any of you start
thinking that the Guilds don’t take
their rugby as seriously as the other
two, in recent times they started their
own rivalry, this one against the Paris
Institute of Technology.
As a quick side note, have a look at
the following Live! story (http://live.
cgcu.net/sport/rugby/127). where you
will find that not only did the Medi-
cal School managed to lose the Unit-
ed Hospitals Cup in 2001, but they
also managed to lose to the Guilds in
friendly match at Teddington. I’ll be
honest here, I seriously doubt if the
Medicals put out their 1st XV for this
game, but a win is a win!
The Sparkes Cup is one of the few
competitions that still exists to this
day, with the RSM beating the Guilds
team earlier in the year and with the
RCS team failing to get enough players
for the game against the Guilds (this
counts as a Guilds win in my books!!!).
Although the Imperial College Rugby
Club is now the main focus of rugby
at the college, taking up a considerable
amount of time, the students still find
the time for some inter-faculty rival-
ry and the chance to try off some
moves that they wouldn’t dare try
in front of the Imperial Coaches.
Long may the glamour, flair and
camaraderie of the Sparkes Cup
remain.
competing on the rugby field for the
honour of their mining school. In 1926
a certain group of ambitious mining
students decided to ‘borrow’ a 3 foot
tall tin beer bottle from the top of a
Bass lorry on which they adorned both
sets of crests and it has since then been
the symbol of the event, and the trophy
for the winner of the rugby match
Although not as intense as the Bot-
tle Match, the Royal College of Science
has its own annual match, with the
club travelling every year to Keble Col-
lege in Oxford for some light-hearted
rugby followed by a night out in Ox-
ford. Even though the other two fac-
ulty teams didn’t have such an intense
rivalry with another club as the RSM
did with Cambourne, each club strived
to perform well in their respective
leagues, however, as is always the case,
there was competition between each
Faculty to find out who was the best.
This is where the Sparkes Cup came in.
Looking through the archive, it
seemed that rugby was very different
back then, the obvious conclusion be-
ing that the scores were very low, take
this 1950’s game between the RCS and
the RSM:
“The R.C.S. pack led by Smith and
amongst whom black bearded Hague
was prominent, completely sub-
dued the Mines pack, but having
gained possession of the ball little
else was done. Although on paper the
R.C.S. backline is the most
powerful of the three
colleges they

next few weeks, that every
year the Imperial School of
Medicine take on the rest
of the College in the annual Varsity
Matches. The culmination will be the
JPR Williams Cup between the two 1st
XV sides in front of a packed crowd.
For the rugby clubs at least, this is one
of their biggest matches and the recent
score lines will testify to it, but what
was it like before the JPR Williams Cup
for the Club. The simple answer is the
Sparkes Cup.
Stanley Robert Sparkes joined the
Civil Engineering Department in 1934
as a Demonstrator, in Structures, and
worked his way through academic ap-
pointments to become Professor of
Structural Engineering in 1958. As well
as being Dean of the City and Guilds
College between 1964-1967, he was
also the President of the Imperial Col-
lege Football Club, and it is after him
that the competition get’s its name.
Although the College was founded
in 1907, the constituent College’s had
existed before then and subsequently,
so had some of their sports clubs. The
City and Guilds College, for example,
which was founded in 1876 has had a
rugby club since 1898 and the club still
exists to this day.
Rugby is one of those sports that you
can’t really get away from. Like rowing
and football, it is an integral part of any
schoolboy’s life, or at least it was back
in the day, with the individual making
the choice really early one, some times
not really deciding on one, but all
three. It therefore makes sense that as
the individual progresses through the
educational system, these clubs would
exist at the higher education level and
why there is always a lot of history.
At the start of the century, each
club used to focus on its own
season and they developed
their own rivalries; take the
Royal School of Mines
and their Bottle Match
against the Cam-
bourne School of
Mines which
will take place
this weekend.
For 108

lacked the thrust necessary to take
them over the line.
Edward’s sound kicking was a great
asset to the Mines too, on the few occa-
sions when they had the ball were un-
certain as to what to do. The only score
of the match came halfway through the
second half when a loose pass between
the Mines halves allowed Jacobson to
swoop in to score close to the post with
Coppleman converting.”
As the years went on and the im-
portance of the Imperial rugby club
grew, this competition, unlike
some of its contemporar-
ies, has managed to last-
ed the test of time and it
is still being played to
this day. And why
shouldn’t it!
