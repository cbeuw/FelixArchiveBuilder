LMAO - scopes: may induce ROFL or MEGA LOLS
So, you’re sitting in the Union thinking it can’t get any worse than this. Well, don’t worry, it can!
Cancer
You go to work. You
flirt with the secretary
before settling down
with your cup of
coffee at the desk. You
fax some reports on
the standard of healthcare at British hosptials
before leaving the office. After a long commute
you settle down to watch Eastenders. After the
episode is over you go to bed and murder a
child.
Virgo
You meet a small
Jewish girl on
the bus. You
immediately hit
it off and go for a
long walk through
Richmond Park.You talk of your experiences,
your lives and you know that you two are
meant to be together. She then drops a
bombshell. She is in fact 80 years old and Anne
Frank. The diary was a lie, she escaped!
Gemini
Over the
weekend you
discover World
of Warcraft. You
roll a troll priest.
You never again
leave your room. Your beard grows longer
that your pubes. You become the champion
of the WoW world and then kill yourself as
your life now feels meaningless. Nobody no-
tices and you funeral never even happens.
Pisces
You find a four year
old girl stuck in the
crawlspace of your
house. You decide
not to report it to
the police and make
her your new wife. Sadly she cannot clean
very effectively anymore because she’s a bit
wrong after you threw a party and used her
as the pinata after the bitch binged out on
Haribo.
Leo
You see a cute
American girl at the
Union. You decide
to go and talk to her,
hopefully you’ll get laid
tonight. Everything
goes wonderfully and you take her back to your
apartment and rapidly begin to engage in a
hearty make-out session. When you remove her
underwear however you find she is a man. Never
mind - you flip her over and get on with it.
Aries
This week, you find
yourself not breath-
ing properly. You ring
NHS Direct and they
tell you to call Emer-
gency Services. You
think you’re hard so you don’t and just bitch
down the phone to anyone that’ll listen. Your
girlfriend finally drags you into hospital and
the doctors and discharges you with a severe
case of pussyitis.
Scorpio
You spent all your
money in the shops and
are so broke you can’t
afford to pay your rent.
Your landlord is a huge,
angry Slovakian man
who terrifies you so you go and sell some of your
eggs. Sadly the hospital meant chicken’s eggs. You
get arrested when looking in a friend’s chicken
coop for eggs, pervert. You are given life imprison-
ment and feed your cell mate Sevilla oranges.
Libra
You decide to take
some Ketamine and
feel as though you
are ON A BOAT.
Oh no, the boat is
falling into a massive
whirlpool. You’re drowning... Wait, everything
is sharpening. What? The world sharpens up...
Where are you... ?! In the police station, you
shot Gary Numan, Simon Singh, Eric Cantona,
Jeremy Kyle, The Sheriff but not the Deputy.
Taurus
You and your friend
go out for dinner.
But they foolishly
forget to bring their
wallet and you end
up paying for their
dinner. You read in a magazine that this means
they want to have sex with you. So you take
them into a back alley and have your wicked
way with them. You assume the screaming is just
for effect.
Capricorn
I just wanna tell you
how I’m feeling. Gotta
make you understand.
Never gonna give you
up. Never gonna let you
down. Never gonna run
around and desert you. Never gonna make you
cry. Never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a
lie and hurt you.
Rick Roll’d... Pint?
Aquarius
You decide to run
for President of the
Union. You think
you have a good
chance and you get
the required number
of seconders. You decide that you’re going to
get ahead by going to a very legitimate course
on giving speeches. You soon find out that the
course was planned by the opposition. No one
ever finds out what happened to you.

Sagittarius
You take a trip in a
time machine and
realise that until 0BC
we were not infact
bipedal. We had one
leg and one wheel.
You decide to revert back to “the good old days”
so cut off your leg and replace it with a wheel.
You sell your limb to Cancer Research amd
bankrupt them. With this money you buy a
colony in Cote d’Ivoire,t
