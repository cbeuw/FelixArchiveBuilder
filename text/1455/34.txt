Quote of the Week
Wordoku 1,455
Solution 1454
How to play:
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters. Complete the puzzle and then
send the whole grid to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the word alone. It’s not
an anagram.
Evil Wordoku is exactly the same... only harder... and
there’s a letter missing... that MAY be a duplicate -
just solve it like normal and insert the letter that you
believe makes the word. And worth double.

Wordpath 1,455
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORD -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would
be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.

N
ot had an amazingly ac-
tive this week. Think it’s
because I am currently liv-
ing in a lab trying to polish
a bit of metal. No seriously I must
spend at least 10 hours a week polish-
ing and grinding. And no, that is not
some kinky teenage porn reference.
As to why it’s teenage I’ll let you pon-
der. Moving from that rather disturb-
ing image that I’m sure the EEE faulty
are enjoying slightly too much to the
events of Wednesday on the Hockey
field.
For any of you who actually care a
bit about this university, and choose
having a laugh over sitting holed up
in your room like a hermit crab whose
been deformed beyond recognition,
will know that the Bottle Match is
coming up. There will be a further ex-
planation about this match next week,
but in a nutshell, it’s been bigger and
better than varsity. The winner of the
rugby match gets the Bottle which
is currently sitting in the Union Bar.
As I’m a Hockey player, we’ve been
in training, and on Wednesday I got
carded for ‘being overly dangerous to
myself.’ Yes, I don’t know either. After
checking for signs of heroin addiction I
concluded that the umpire was simply
a dozy twat. He was.
Apparently the bars have been re-
named. Great. Because traditionally
I don’t choose a place to drink using
the, possibly blue-sky approach of
price, comfort and atmosphere. Oh
no. Whenever I walk past a Rose and
Crown I can’t help but wander in for
a quick pint. However see a Trap and
Pony and I scarper like a rat up a drain-
pipe. What goes through these peoples
minds? It’s just a fucking name. People
will complain, as I am doing now, but
at the end of the day who really gives a
shit? If people choose not to come to a
bar because of a name then sod them.
You probably don’t want twats like that
kicking about the place anyway.
Finally this place is bad enough as it
is, what with Physics students walk-
ing round with E=MC2
on the back of
their hoodies. You look like a wannabe
hoodlum gang member. No, I lie. You
look like a 18 year old spotty white kid
whose trying to be cool. Or in other
words, a stretched arsehole. So lets not
go for geeky puns on ‘Imperial’ for the
name eh? Pah, Whatever.
