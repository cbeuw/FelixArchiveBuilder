THE ESSENTIAL REVIEW - ORANGES
THIS WEEK HANGMAN INTERVIEWS FELIX’S SHITTY EDITORS ABOUT ORANGES, CITRUS ABUSE & TIN*
Barack_attack_l33thaxor
Hu complains about bullyin these dayz? I thought
only the fat ginger kids with no friends did dat.
lolololol - fat people lololol
SexyOsama69
u shudn’t laugh at fat people Obie, its not their
fault. HAHAHAHAHA - it was so hard to
typde dat. My fingers wer shakin wiv laughter
H
ere at Hangman we believe that oranges are hugely underappre-
ciated. Just the other day, we saw an old lady dispose of a whole
orange into a nearby pond. In a fit of rage, we grabbed her suitcase-
trolley thing and bludgeoned her to death. As we stood over her
mutilated corpse, with blood soaking through our newly bought
Nike Airs, we let out a sigh of satisfaction knowing that justice had been rightly
served. A passing duck quacked as if to say, “Jesus Christ! Is that an orange? I can’t
eat an orange, I’m a fucking duck! I don’t have the piercing beak shape that other
birds possess to gnaw through the thick outer peel.”
Seeing such depraved oranges left us distraught. Why!? Why would someone
throw a whole orange into a pond? A WHOLE ORANGE! We wondered how
much oranges meant to others. This week we interviewed fellow editors about
oranges and how they have influenced their lives. Everything they say is genuine.
WHEN DID YOU FIRST DISCOVER ORANGES? I was five years old. My par-
ents believed in the ‘fruit-a-year’ policy the government brought in, which en-
tailed introducing a new fruit to a child each year to avoid stressing them out over
the vast amount of choice.
ANY EMBARRASSING ORANGE-BASED ANECDOTES? I was making sweet
love to my girlfriend one evening, when she told me that I just wasn’t exciting
enough. In a desperate attempt to liven things up I went down to my kitchen to
see if there was anything I could use to improvise. There on the counter sat a fist-
sized Seville orange. Dark thoughts entered my mind… Should I? Could I? I did! I
sliced the orange into boat segments and ate them in front of ‘Lord of the Rings:
The Two Towers’. I haven’t seen my girlfriend since.
HOW HAVE ORANGES INFLUENCED TODAY’S MUSIC? It’s a shame really.
Music seems to be all about love and poker faces these days. I miss the days of the
orange. The Beatles, Led Zepplin, Blondie, Blazin Squad – all about the oranges.

SECTION: SCIENCE EDITOR
WHAT IS YOUR FIRST ORANGE-RELATED MEMORY? I was two years old
and my Dad took me and my twin sister, Madeline, to the Marmalade festival
in California. My Dad was dressed as a giant orange and took us up a large hill
to overlook the local town, Sutter Creek. He was showing us the festive Orange
Dance when he lost his balance and rolled down the hill. I was caught by a pass-
ing Native American called Pocumtuck, but my sister was crushed to death.
WHAT IS THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE ORANGE? The orange was invented
by an Irish physician called Thomas O’Range in 1535 for the treatment of scurvy.
He used highly radioactive isotopes to achieve the oranginess desired for high
vitamin C content. Oranges are now the number one cause of cancer in the UK.
FAVOURITE ORANGE-BASED QUOTE? ‘At this moment in time, one cannot
be sure whether the cat inside the box is alive or dead. It is therefore in a state of
being both alive and dead. Of course when we open the box, we find an orange
lol’ Erwin Schrodinger

anges – I’m a vegetarian. Oranges are my friends :D

THAT WASN’T A QUESTION lmao
YOU’RE ACTUALLY SAYING ‘LMAO’ LIKE IT’S A WORD lmao

a joke somewhere about my Chinese
heritage. It’s all you ever do. I just want
the readers to know that I’m actually

article about oranges?
BECAUSE WE LOVE ORANGES!

orange. They’re boring.
WHY?...WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? When I was young, my uncle chained
me to his cellar wall and threw oranges at my broken naked body. THAT’S WHY!
HAHAHA, YOU’RE JOKING RIGHT?

*Exciting Tin Fact: Below 3.72K, tin behaves as a superconductor. Meissner Effect that is commonly
observed in superconductors was first discovered in tin crystals.
