Van Rompuy and
secrecy? Days be-
fore he was appointed “President of
Europe” he gave an audition speech
to members of the secretive Bilder-
berg Group, of which only parts were
released to the public. Now he is at
it again. At last week’s meeting of
heads of government, when the crisis
in Greece was high on the agenda, he
circulated another secret document,
this time calling for more central
planning of European economies by
the EU.
As the Associated Press (AP) got
its hands on the “unpublished docu-
ment” and revealed the gist of Van
Rompuy’s proposals, it is easy to
see why he was so keen to keep his
thoughts from the public.
Van Rompuy is drawing up a blue-
print for the way European countries
manage their economic affairs, pro-
posing that the EU get involved in
planning national policies and ensur-
ing they are carried out.
It is difficult to imagine in which
EU capitals his proposals will be
warmly welcomed. The British and
Irish, while not averse to cuts, claim
to be opposed to any further surren-
der of sovereignty to Brussels. French
voters, for their part, are unlikely to
take kindly to Van Rompuy’s demand
that worker protections should be
slashed and that the EU should be
able to limit spending on welfare and
pensions.
Van Rompuy says, “Europe can no
longer afford to pay generous pen-
sions, health care and unemploy-
ment — the spending that, especially
with aging populations, has built up
heavier and heavier levels of govern-
ment debt, made worse by paying out
hundreds of billions of euros to bail
out banks and stimulate recession-
plagued economies.”
The AP says he has proposed a new
system of “economic governance”,
which would give Brussels more over-
sight into how member states run
their budgets. This goes well beyond
the EU and European Central Bank’s
current budgetary supervision; the
ECB’s rule that deficits should never
rise above 3 percent is routinely flout-
ed by Eurozone members, including
Paris and Berlin.
Van Rompuy proposes that the EU
draw up a set of five common eco-
nomic targets, then tailor them for
Following a policy paper by the EU president, Herman Van Rompuy, Neil Dhir questions what he is up to...

week
Brown is a bully?
Following the revelation that em-
ployees at 10 Downing Street had
complained to an anti-bullying
helpline, the media has been
rife with alegations that Gordon
Brown bullies those he works
with. It has been reported for a
while that the Prime Minister has
a fiery temper in private, and peo-
ple on the opposite side to Brown
in the Labour divide appear to
think of him as an autocrat. The
Chancellor, Alistair Darling, also
reported that the Brown un-
leashed the “forces of hell” on him
after claiming the recession would be terrible back in 2008.
Conservatives try to buy votes
George Osborne, the Shadow Chancellor,
has announced a plan to give out a “people’s
bonus” by selling shares in state owned banks
to the general public at a discounted price.
The Tories were instantly criticised for this as
a shameful attempt at buying votes. The cur-
rent plan is to hold the shares until they can
be sold at a profit. The Conservative plan is to
throw away that profit by selling the shares
at a low value. Currently RBS shares are trad-
ing at below book value so if people wanted
to buy them at a discounted rate they could
basically do so now, rather than waiting for
the government to hold their hand (Note:
this should not be taken as financial advice).
each country. EU experts would mon-
itor the goals, which would be linked
to EU funding and loans. Noncompli-
ant governments may be “named and
shamed,” which could affect their
borrowing on bond markets.
Some aspects of Van Rompuy’s
proposals have been guardedly wel-
comed. The French and Germans are
currently under centre-right govern-
ments (and Angela Merkel’s position
depends on her coalition partners,
the free-market Free Democrats). As
such, Van Rompuy’s reality check on
pensions, health spending and wel-
fare are not likely to be dismissed as
the rantings of a madman. Moreover,
neither Merkel nor France’s Nicolas
Sarkozy are ideologically opposed to
greater European integration. Britain
however, with the likely inception of
the Conservative party as the govern-
ment this spring, most certainly is.
The example of Greece, which al-
lowed public spending to spiral out
of control, has convinced many that
monetary union must be accompa-
nied by economic and political un-
ion in a sacrifice of “sovereignty for
stability”.
Many mainstream economists ar-
gue that Europe needs to liberalise
its economy and slash spending on
welfare, though leftists claim that
high benefits payments keep con-
sumer markets afloat in the midst of
recessions.
Indeed, Britain is one of Europe’s
proudest liberal economies, yet the
recession has outlasted that of left-
leaning nations and our deficit - cur-
rently hovering at Greek levels - is one
of the worst in Europe.
The problem is how to do it. Trade
Unions and large numbers of ordi-
nary workers strongly oppose any
further slashing of Europe’s welfare
state; governments fear anything
from strike action to riots in opposi-
tion to the budgetary measures many
believe are necessary.
Some supporters of liberalisation in
states where spending is high active-
ly support handing over budgetary
control to Brussels, much as British
left-wingers supported closer EU in-
tegration in the 1980s as a means of
wresting control from the Thatcher
government.
The EU, it is reckoned, could take
unpopular decisions that voters
would oppose. France has long used
the tactic of blaming Brussels when
making necessary cuts; many French
voters oppose EU integration because
they see Brussels as a “neoliberal
plot.” The President of Europe’s pro-
posals would confirm this. However,
under Van Rompuy, the EU appears
to be offering itself as a scapegoat for
cuts in exchange for greater control of
budgets.
This marks a shift in how Brussels
wants to be perceived. For decades,
the European Union wondered why
it was so unloved among Europe’s
tribes. It paid vast sums to propagan-
dists and spent fortunes on public
projects in the hope that Eurosceptic
sentiment might diminish if citizens
saw bridges and roads built with funds
from Brussels. Yet it has never won
the public’s affections and France, the
Netherlands and Ireland have all re-
jected granted the EU greater powers
in recent referenda.
Unfortunately, post-Lisbon Treaty,
the age of referenda is over. The EU’s
leaders figure that they no longer
have to convince European citizens.
Instead, integration can be pushed
through from crisis to crisis.
Nicolas Veron of the Bruegel In-
stitute, a Brussels-based economic
think-tank, says “the more crises you
have, the more you will have mo-
ments where you will have tradeoff of
sovereignty.”
Van Rompuy himself says that the
Greek crisis has “opened the window
for greater reform.”
Perhaps the EU’s leaders believe
that the economic crisis will cow
protestors into submitting to its eco-
nomic governance. There may be a
feeling that while governments are
often the target of protests and activ-
ists, the EU is seen to be too diffuse
and distant to become the subject of
a Europe-wide campaign.
The resistance to these “reforms” is
likely to be felt in the streets, not least
because not one of the heads of gov-
ernment who convened in Brussels
last week felt the need to protest when
the President put this unpublished
paper before them. A note of caution
though Europeans are nothing if not
masters of throwing off Empires.
These are strange days. Lisbon en-
shrined constant upheaval as the
constitutional status of EU states; the
financial crisis has made the conti-
nent’s economic future and the live-
lihoods of its citizens appear very
bleak indeed. Europeans are subject-
ed to more surveillance and scrutiny
than ever before, while being ever
more exposed to the vagaries of glo-
balised power and commerce. Crisis
after crisis: The perfect moment for
revolution.
The only problems is that most peo-
ple who care nowadays are mostly
armchair-generals.
