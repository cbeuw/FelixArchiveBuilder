Fresher wins Imperial Idol with Amy Winehouse cover
Last Thursday (18th), dBs saw crowds
of people gather to watch the final of
Imperial Idol in which Medic Fresher
Sangita Chatterjee won.
The event, organised by Save The
Children had eight finalists from
across College all competing for the
crown of being 2010’s Imperial Idol.
Preliminary rounds had taken place
in the form of “Hall Idol” and various
other auditions in which acts were
put through to Thursday night’s finale
event. Judges Alex Ross, Medic lec-
turer Dr. Chris John, Felix Editor Dan
Wan, and Deputy President (Clubs
& Societies) Jenny Wilson were on
hand to oversee and comment on the
night’s proceedings.
The first impressive performance
came from Vic, a 2nd year French-
Swedish biologist who performed a
stunning rendition of Whitney Hou-
their welcome on stage with Dan Wan
commenting that “the bit where you
all went mental at the end was just a
bit unnecessary.” However, all four
judges also admitted they were a solid
band and commented their perform-
ance probably hadn’t done their re-
corded tracks justice.
Yourssuf Saleh entertainted the
crowd with version of Justin Tim-
berlake’s XXXXX, even getting the
crowd singing along. Whilst Jenny
Wilson was suitably impressed, the
other three judges decided the per-
formance was over-rehearsed, with
Dr. Chris John commenting his per-
formance was “tried and tested.”
The night finished with two very
strong performances with Sangita
singing alongside a full complement
of instruments to Valerie by Amy
Winehouse/The Zutons. Her strong
voice and pitch-perfect execution was
matched by the last performer, KUDZI.
The solo artist sang and danced to the
T
he answer to the question
on everyone’s lips has fi-
nally been announced. Af-
ter weeks of violent spec-
ulation, Imperial Student
Union has revealed that the new club
next year to replace dBs will be called
Metric. Obviously as the name sug-
gests, it is hoped that Metric will be an
improvement on dBs. The name of the
new bar (after getting rid of da Vinci’s)
however, is still to be decided!
Metric was the winner of an online
poll for students, winning by a massive
margin over the other options, with
voter numbers reaching much higher
than expected because of the contro-
versy over the shortlist. Ashley Brown
had said the naming process “will be
the most controversial part of the pres-
idency then. Or, a triumph of student
involvement.”
Whilst Metric won by popular con-
sensus for the nightclub, the same can-
not be said for the new bar, the win-
ning name for which was the Consort,
coming only narrowly ahead of the
other options and attracting lots of
negative comments about the options.
These were drawn up from students’
suggestions, first by filtering the dross
to leave 150 plausible names which
were then considered by a team of five,
consisting of Ashley Brown, Dan Wan,
a student and two members of staff.
An initial outcry against some of the
suggested options spurred interest in
the poll and while the naming of the
new club seems to have been a suc-
cess, there have also been a significant
number of negative complaints on the
website. In fact, it’s difficult to find
people who are happy with the short-
list for the bar at all. Most complain
that they don’t like any of the names so
they’ve had to choose the least worst
option. A facebook group for instance,
has been set-up promoting Rock Bot-
tom as a moniker instead.
It’s difficult to see how the Union
could have carried out a more demo-
cratic process, which was entirely
student-led and in which students who
wanted to influence the decision have
had excellent opportunities to do so
through proposing names and pro-
moting their favourites.
Of course it would be impossible
to please everyone, but it must be ac-
cepted that this democratic method
was the best way to please the greatest
number of people. The only barrier to
a well-chosen name is student apathy,
and for naming the bar, it’s all still to
play for.
After listening to the complaints of
students, the Union is holding off the
final decision. In order to choose a
name for the new bar which is more
popular, it is probable that nomina-
tions will be re-opened, the least popu-
lar dropped and a second round will be
used to determine the outcome. This
will please those who voted on an un-
official Live! poll where RON took the
majority of the votes, presumably from
people with suggestions of a higher
standard.
It seems likely that after facing the
prospect of a truly disastrous name
change, and realising what they have
to lose, the campaign for the naming
of the new bar will be hotly fought.
Imperial converted to Metric
The results of the polls to rename the Union bars are in, but the Union have taken the decision to hold off on
a final name for the new Da Vinci’s. Rox Middleton reports on the latest decisions made this week

resident Sangita
Chatterjee
won with her
version of
‘Valerie’ by Amy
Winehouse. She
performed with
an impressive
5-man band
ston’s “Saving All My Love For You”.
Judge Alex Ross was not entirely con-
vinced by her on-stage antics however
after Vic suggestively took off her
jacket mid-song.
Kitty Magic and Wolfy and the Tin
Can 44s battled it out for the label
of best band, with the latter provid-
ing a massively popular and comical
performance of their song “I’ve Lost
My Mojo”. The judges decided unani-
mously that Kitty Magic outplayed Kings of Leon’s Sex on Fire. This wasn’t
before silencing the crowd with a jaw-
droppingly dramatic start to the song.
However, after the audience cast
their votes, hosts for the night Jaimie
Henry and Fran Conway announced
runner-up Wolfy and the Tin Can
44s, and overall winner Sangita. She
was cheered along by a large con-
tigent of her hall-mates. An elated
Sangita commented: “To be honest,
I was completely incredulous when I
won Imperial Idol. All I can remem-
ber was feeling really nervous before
going on; but the audience’s reaction
was so warm once I’d started singing,
I just became calm and relaxed. Even
though I was happy with how I’d done,
I didn’t think in a million years I’d ac-
tually win it!
Credit has to go to my band, who re-
ally lifted the energy of the perform-
ance and made it what it was. Impe-
rial Idol has definitely inspired me to
perform more, and make the most of
the many opportunities at imperial-
so I’m afraid you haven’t heard the last
from me yet!”
“The only barrier to
a well-chosen name
is student apathy.”
Top bar chart for new nightclub name: dBs looks to be renamed ‘Metric’. Bar chart below, the poll for the new bar name
that has not been finalised yet as voting opens again. ‘Crown & Shield’ is likely to be dropped in favour of a new name.
