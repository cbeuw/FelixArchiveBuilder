Aunty McPickle always makes sure to get her 5-a-day, and doesn’t ask questions
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I got a text today from my mum,
meant for her boyfriend. It read
“Sorry I had to leave, you were di-
vine last night. Bet the neighbours
will complain!” Given that my mum
recently had her bowel removed and
replaced with a colostomy bag, I am
traumatised. I really can’t handle the
visions now entering my head. What
do I do?
Barbara Beverly
Dear Barbara,
Try to focus your thoughts on other
things. If it helps, try painting or yoga.
If this fails, I suggest getting involved.
Colostomy bags are nothing to be
scared of!

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I recently noticed that my boyfriend
stores tangerines in his foreskin,
like a man-hamster mutant. I was
not impressed but went along as I
love him. However, he has begun to
use his foreskin-purse to smuggle
Dairylea into the library. When I go
round to his, I don’t know whether
to bring condoms or crackers. Help
me with this tangy cheese crisis!
Lizzie Boyce
Dear Lizzie Boyce,
As a previous lover, don’t think I
haven’t seen the smuggled grapes in
your va-jay-jay. Stop being such a hyp-
ocrite and get with it. Picnics are cool!

The Perfect Friday:
Chillax Or Ravemash?
I like to spend my Fridays in the company of lots of sexy, sexy
ladies. Which is why I go to UCL Union.
Third Year
My weekends consist of going out Friday evening and waking
up in lectures on Monday, with no memory in between.

rassing problem. On a recent night
out in Amsterdam, I got my clitoris
pierced. This was painful enough
but nothing compared to the static
shocks I receive daily. The worst
pulses come from library banisters
and are accompanied by a moist slop
sound and a restrained yelp. How do
I silence this phenomenon?

Dear Jill,
Take it out, Jill! Do it NOW! On the li-
brary stairs if you have to!

A new way of promoting the 5-a-day
campaign proves amazingly effective!
