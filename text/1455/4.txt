The Imperial College Business School
has been selected as the lead academic
partner for Microsoft’s Innovation
Outreach Programme (IOP), following
an agreement which came to light dur-
ing a Global Investment Conference
held by the Prime Minister. The role
will make Imperial’s innovation, man-
agement, technology and engineering
qualities available to the IOP, of which
a range of multinational companies are
members.
The agreement will grant Imperial
funding and research opportunities
for, and with, other IOP members.
Imperial’s role will be to provide busi-
ness focused research and engineering
expertise for technical development
and proof-of-concepts. The opportu-

nity also allows members of the IOP to
work alongside Imperial Innovations,
which is a leading commercialisation
and investment company involved
with testing and launching business
projects, partly owned by Imperial
College.
Microsoft’s IOP was established in
2009 and is mostly comprised of highly
reputable companies. The innova-
tion executives from these companies
meet regularly to discuss challenges in
product and service development, and
how they may be overcome in order to
meet today’s standards and expecta-
Microsoft partners with Imperial
tions competitively. Microsoft has ex-
panded the IOP into Europe and added
ten companies. The Business School
was chosen to provide academic sup-
port for both American and European
ventures.
Microsoft’s Technical Strategy & In-
novation Chief of Operations, Michael
Steep, commented that ‘’Imperial is a
perfect fit for the IOP and its global
members. It offers the latest research
and practice on business model and
process innovation, alongside an im-
pressive track record of spinning out
successful companies.’’ He continued
to add that ‘’the University combines
world class expertise in science, en-
gineering and medicine with a top
business school for innovation. Impe-
rial has a truly entrepreneurial culture
which fits well with the IOP so we’re
really pleased to announce this part-
nership to the IOP members.’’
Imperial will start their role by de-
signing and performing research for
the IOP’s conference at Microsoft’s
US headquarters in March and June,
where they will discuss improving in-
novation processes with other corpo-
rate members.
Professor David Gann, head of the
Innovation and Entrepreneurship re-
search group at the Business School,
commented that Imperial ‘’will bring
together experts from a range of indus-
tries and share what is learnt through
applied, market-facing research for
the members’’ and that the college is
‘’very pleased to be a central part of
this strong network.’’ Describing the
IOP, he mentioned: ‘’It’s an exceptional
group of companies. They lead by con-
tinual - sometimes radical - product or
service improvement. The IOP is a new
model we hope will let corporations
open their R&D departments to create
new, exciting and successful ventures
with other IOP partners.’’
Imperial’s commitment to the role
raisesawarenessandacknowledgement
of their internationally outstanding ed-
ucation and research. Lord Mandelson,
the UK Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills said that: ‘’Impe-
rial College is offering a service that
no one else in the world can provide:
specialist expertise, reliably connected
across disciplines, linked directly to
what the market requires. This coun-
try’s investment in knowledge, skills
development and meaningful research
means our universities set the bar for
excellence that others must try to beat.’’
A transcript from the PM’s confer-
ence is available online.
Michael Steep,
Microsoft’s
Technical
Strategy &
Innovation Chief
of Operations,
said Imperial was
a “perfect fit” for
Microsoft’s latest
programme
Imperial should be expecting one of these really fancy signs on Exhibition Road fairly soon, then.
