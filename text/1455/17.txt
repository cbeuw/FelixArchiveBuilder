A
fter having had a less than
enjoyable experience force-
fully telling the woman on
the door that I really was
on the guest list I had really hoped
that my evening would improve once
the bands had started their sets. This,
however, was regrettably not the case.
Birds of Tokyo were the first band to
play - their tunes were relatively catchy
and at least the singer was compre-
hensible. Though they were perhaps
lacking in “cool factor” with the lead
singer’s dancing looking like a cross be-
tween Buddy Holly and a seal and with
every band member in possession of re-
ceding hairlines and “dad-style” danc-
ing. However in total they were pretty
much heartrendingly generic with al-
most every song sounding similar to
a song you’d heard before by another
band and impressively repetitive lyrics.
But they were the first band, I was sure
that the bands playing next were going
to be good... or at least better.
Next General Fiasco walk onto the
stage and, to be brutally honest, one
could hardly even describe them as
having been a general fiasco - they
were really far too forgettable for
such a description. They look exactly
like any other indie band except with
whinier vocals. I’m afraid to say I can-
not comment on the lyricism because
I couldn’t hear any of the words. True,
they did support “massive acts” such
as One Night Only and The Pigeon
Detectives, in other words other dull
pseudo-mainstream indie bands with
very little artistic vision. Possibly the
explanation for this is that General
Fiasco perhaps made these mediocre
bands seem good by comparison.
Band of Skulls were the final band to
play and I was surprised, I had suspect-
ed Death Metal but was instead greet-
ed by White Stripes style rock, which
was never something I was a fan of in
the first place. I was not convinced by
the man’s voice, however the female
bassist was considerably better. Per-
haps their set would have improved,
but after having been unimpressed
for two hours already and then having
a girl asking me to move because she
couldn’t see. If you have met me you’ll
realise you need to be about 12 years
old to have your view blocked by me,
I decided that enough was enough and
left before the end. - Renny Norman

They’re just generally a fiasco
P
icture the moment. You’ve just taken a
road-trip across America, New York to
California and it’s your first evening at
Coachella. The temperature’s a steamy
30 degrees and the sun is taking an ab-
solute age to drop down under the horizon. You’re
sitting in sandals and shorts and tonight you and
your friends will get to see Jay-Z, Vampire Week-
end, the Specials, Passion Pit and Grizzly Bear
amongst others. Coachella is maybe the greatest
music festival on the planet. It happens in Indio,
California on 16th April. It’ll cost you a cool $269
to get in and you’ve got to get there anyway. So
for now it’ll remain a dream. - Kadhim Shubber
L
ocated in Austin, Texas, SXSW is a
showcase for new bands and other
creative-types to grab the attention of
record industry pimps and make it to
the big time. However, instead of the
usual hippie camping and baby wipes, 80 bars and
clubs are used as venues so that weak non-Texan
attendees don’t die from overheating.
This year, the music event includes Good
Shoes, the XX, and We Are Scientists among the
other 1,894 I have never heard of which doesn’t
matter as everyone there will be inebriated with
Texan man beer and high on Texan man burgers
anyway. - Lily Le
Some festivals are really far away
T
his festival is actually within range. It
happens on the 27th of May which for
some lucky 3rd and 4th years means
that your exams might be over in time.
So grab a cheap Easyjet flight over to
Barcelona (which is an appealing prospect in it-
self) and then expose your ears to one of the most
amazing lineups in recent history.
The tickets will set you back €150 and so with
a cheap flight, this festival won’t actually cost you
much more than say Glastonbury or Reading.
And considering that U2 are headlining Glaston-
bury, it might be worth that extra bit to see Pixies
and Pavement AND Wilco. - Kadhim Shubber
F
uji Rock is a 3 day festival, set in the
idyllic ski resort of Niigata Prefecture
in Japan, which coincidently is no-
where near Mount Fuji! 30th July – 1st
August, the line-up this year has yet to
be confirmed but last year’s bill included Oasis,
Franz Ferdinand, White Lies and some Japanese
stuff. OK, so it was mainly Japanese stuff and
yes you could probably see all of these people
at a festival somewhere closer to home for a hell
of a lot cheaper because it’s touch expensive at
£236 for a ticket that doesn’t even include camp-
ing but it’s in JAPAN!!! (That’s supposed to sway
you.) - Emily Beech
