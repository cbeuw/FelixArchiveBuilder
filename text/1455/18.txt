HIM
LOVE IN
THEORY AND

SIRE
ALBUM
HIM seem to finally have decided
where their interests lie in the pursuit
of vast sums of money. The album is
chock full of MTV-friendly pop-rock
tracks ‚Äì think of Blink 182 in eyeliner,
singing early-90‚Äôs power ballads ‚Äì and
while it‚Äôs not quite Nickelback terri-
tory, anybody looking for profound
insights into the nature of the human
psyche should probably be looking
elsewhere. The album improves in
the second half ‚Äì the first decent riff
makes an entrance on track 8, ‚ÄúIn the
Arms of Rain‚Äù, but all in all, though, I
probably wouldn‚Äôt bother.

TRAIL
TO THE REST OF
THE WORLD
TWISTID
ALBUM
I know I shouldn‚Äôt, but I really like this
album. It‚Äôs not mould-breaking, it‚Äôs not
going to change the world, but it is a
really nice collection of laid-back rock
songs in the Goo Goo Dolls or Count-
ing Crows vein - the kind of stuff you
want playing loudly on the stereo as
you blast up the highway in your open
top Caddy. At the same time, there‚Äôs a
clear London influence on the music:
tracks like ‚ÄòCity‚Äô, the current single, and
‚ÄòFumes‚Äô leave you in little doubt as to
where the band are from.

Simian Mobile Disco @ Matter
D
uring the early hours of
Sunday morning, Sim-
ian Mobile Disco turn
the amps up to 11, the
heating up to burn, and
energy to lethal at Matter. Cruising
onto stage at a casual 2am, the lights
explode with power and Simian Mo-
bile Disco erupt into their set with au-
dacious energy. Striking up ‚ÄòAudacity
of Huge‚Äô intensified the atmosphere
at Matter. It was a huge sound and a
huge vibe as it started to spiral unin-
hitedly out of control... Oh wait, that
might have been me. As Simian Mobile
Disco soldiered on with the stamina of
electro warriors, their set was a roll-
ercoaster of thundering bass and slic-
ing treble. They leapt around the stage
as their crown leapt around the floor
and it was as if their minds were at one
with the many wires, buttons and dials
of their technologies. The music that
followed Simian Mobile Disco was re-
ally nothing to compare and it‚Äôs safe to
say their huge electronic sound was left
with us for hours. - Luke Turner

Vampire Weekend @ Brixton
I
f I had the means to bring you
the sounds and faces of Vampire
Weekend in a live set, I really
wouldn‚Äôt. Not because they play
horrifically and look ghastly,
but in fact the total opposite; I‚Äôd keep
their tight, well-experienced manner
of playing coupled with one and a half
hours of ‚ÄúWell hello Mr. Koenig. Hello
Mr. Thompson. Aren‚Äôt you looking
fine tonight? Nomnomnom,‚Äù to my-
self. No, not for you mere mortals.
One and a half hours? Indeed. Un-
like most bands that choose the
‚Äúhighlights‚Äù from their releases and
frustrate you until the end of mere 40
minutes because they just won‚Äôt play
that one song that changed your life
(or you know, something along those
lines); VW said fuck it, let‚Äôs play every
single one of our amazing songs and
two of our magnificent B-sides. What
a bunch of attention-seeking sexy
bastards.
Despite their perfect set with string
quartet and all, it was slightly disap-
pointing that their songs were the
same as the recordings and not unique
live interpretations. However, this was
easily outweighed by lights in the eyes
of the album-cover girl on the ban-
ner behind that changed from red to
green to purple; as well as their pat-
ronising wit during audience banter.
Koenig kept the teacher motivation
techniques from his previous job and
told us ‚Äúwell done‚Äù for waiting for the
encore and that it was very ‚Äúpolite‚Äù.
Oh if only.. instead it was time to face
tomorrow, another day of being taught
by some not-so-hot supergeek. Mmm.

IMMORTALITY
WALKER AND
ORFING
ALBUM
What a pile of depressing bollocks.
Attempting to halve the dreariness by
listening with one earphone does not
work, to quarter it by not paying atten-
tion doesn‚Äôt either, and then trying to
get into it (because hopefully that will
make it better) in the last 50 seconds of
some god-driven enlightenment poem
just bores you to the point of anger.
The point where you accidentally leave
it in a random SAF computer CD drive
and are quite glad you can‚Äôt remember
which. - Lily Le
DEAD LIKE
HARRY
KNOW THE
JOY OF GOOD
LIVING
LABEL
ALBUM
Attempting to follow in The Boss‚Äô (Mr
Springsteen‚Äôs) footsteps is a task that
shouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly and Dead like
Harry have fallen short of the mark.
With backing female vocals reminis-
cent of The Beautiful South and a gen-
eral lack of emotion, it didn‚Äôt really grab
my attention. It‚Äôs not terrible but the
hype about them being the next Gas-
light Anthem are a little over the top.
Try Jersey Budd instead! - Emily Beech
Damn you bands from New York with your success and good-looks!
