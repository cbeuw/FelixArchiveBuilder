This year’s BUCS Championship and
Beginner’s Head was a successful one
for Imperial. There were three golds,
two silvers and two bronzes, as well as
several other top ten placings.
Most students doubled and even
tripled up in crews, racing down the
5km head course against the stream on
Peterborough’s Nene River in snowy
conditions.
After being cancelled due to bad
weather last year, it was with great
trepidation that a poor forecast was
predicted over the weekend. Luckily,
coach Stuart Whitelaw’s years of expe-
rience knew how to motivate a squad
in the face of such conditions; “Be pre-
pared for a long day in cold, damp con-
ditions with very few facilities within
walking distance.” Off the back of such
inspiration the novice squad set the
ball rolling in style on Saturday claim-
ing a bronze medal in the MB8+.
The crew were split into fours for the
second division racing as coxed boats.
IC A performed well placing 5th, while
IC B became the victims of a South-
ampton cox who veered into the crew
losing them valuable time. They settled
for 14th.
On Sunday morning the senior men’s
crews awoke to a snow-covered Peter-
borough and were still reeling from the
injury of Henry Goodier the previous
day in a practice paddle.
Boat Club shore up 106 BUCS points in one weekend
Christina Duffy Rowing
Could you think of a better way to earn BUCS points for your university? Didn’t think not. Hypothermia’s in for 2010.
It was the lightweight squad who
brought home the bacon, winning gold
in the LM4x and collecting silver in
the LM4-. Drama had unfolded ear-
lier back at the hotel when it was dis-
covered that the weighing scales had
been forgotten resulting in a very light
breakfast for the paranoid crew.
The first division bore the brunt of
the bad weather with hypothermia
claiming another BUCS athlete who
had to be rescued from his boat. This
resulted in all other crews having to
wait in the heavily falling snow.
The MC4+ were stranded for over
45 minutes and according to Bellion,
bowman Andy Gordon was horrified:
“Man, it’s like the coldest thing ever. I
can’t do this for much longer.” Gordon
was so traumatised by the whole expe-
rience that the quad in the second divi-
sion had to scratch.
Meanwhile Alex Gillies was causing
a fuss at not being allowed to race in
skins. Despite the cold the MC4+ man-
aged a solid bronze. Steele is alleged to
have informed a slightly concerned
Bellion that: “I loved stroking you.”
When asked about it later Bellion was
adamant: “The pleasure was all his.”
The MC8+ placed fifth in 15:31 be-
hind winners Oxford Brookes while
the MI8+ finished fourth, also behind
a winning Oxford Brookes crew. The
MC4+ had packed their cans of Whoo-
pass as requested and took gold in
16:45 ahead of Reading in 17:07.
With only 5 Imperial students in the
women’s squad it was only possible to
enter two boats, of which both med-
alled. The result of the day went to the
WC4+ who won their event in 19:38,
01:26 ahead of Nottingham Trent who
took silver. This was also faster than
the winning WC4- (Cardiff: 19:42).
The WC4x took silver behind a
strong Durham crew. Staying in peak
physical condition to ward off possible
seat threats has taken its toll on Chris-
tina Duffy who will be wearing her yet
to arrive medals for the foreseeable
future.
At the end of the day ICBC scored
106 BUCS points for Imperial (third
overall) behind Reading (115) and
Durham (130). ICBC continues to edge
closer to the top ranked university and
looks forward to a successful season
off the back of these strong results.
