felix FRIDAY 26 FEBRUARY 2010
Imperial College’s long-standing tra-
dition of mascotry caused the newly
elected City & Guilds College Union
(CGCU) President Dan Lundy to lit-
erally give over the CGCU mascot
Spanner to the Royal School of Mines
(RSM) during Friday’s Tri-Union
Comedy Night at the Union.
Confusion and subsequent attrition
arose after ACC Chair, Miner and
Chap, Charles Murdoch managed to
convince Lundy that RSM’s Chaps
Club would look after Spanner under
the pretence that the RSM were now
officially a segment of CGCU. Lundy
then, with the help of Murdoch, car-
ried over the weighty mascot to the
Miners. To Lundy’s bemusement,
members of the Chaps Club, the RSM
Gentlemen’s (drinking) Society bun-
dled Spanner out of the Union and
onto the Beit Quad Lawn.
Links Club, the CGCU’s Chaps Club
equivalent, quickly caught wind of the
situation unfolding and pursued their
mascot onto the lawn where a muddy
tug-of-war situation between RSM
Chaps and CGCU Links arose. The
devious and muddied Miners even-
tually got Spanner out of the Quad.
Charles Murdoch has confirmed that
Spanner now lies “in a safe place in
College”.
The night’s proceedings escalated
when angry and embarrassed Guilds-
men retaliated by stealing the RSM
Bottle from behind the Union bar.
The RSM Bottle is jointly-owned by
the RSM and Camborne School of
Mines (CSM) in Cornwall; it does not
traditionally take part in mascotry.
The RSM and CSM go to battle for the
prize Bottle on the rugby field every
year.

Spanner captured by Miners
due to go ahead this week, common
sense took precedence and the Bottle
was returned.
Felix has managed to get hold of a
formal apology letter addressed to the
‘RSM and Chaps past and present’
which is signed off by Andrew Mac-
Fayden (Links Club Honourary Sec-
retary) and Dan Lundy. The letter
shows the CGCU swallowing their
pride and admitting their “wrong do-
ing was a case of poor misjudgement”.
The letter continues “In what was
thought to be an act of mascotry, a
small minority of our members took
it upon themselves to remove The
Bottle from the Union bar. I am as-
sured that there was no intention to
permanently deprive and that The
Bottle has been returned as quickly as
possible.”
Mascotry is a historical tradition
between rival Faculty Unions at Im-
perial. Each Faculty Union, and RAG
have at least one violate mascot. The
CGCU have two in Spanner and Bolt,
the RSM have Davy (a Davy mining
lamp), and the RCSU hold a 7ft stain-
less steel thermometer named Theta.
The idea is for members of the Faculty
Unions to use skill, intelligence and
deviance to ‘capture’ others’ mascots.
To keep proceedings friendly, only
violate mascots can be ‘stolen’. Mas-
cots are generally brought out during
Faculty Union events, such as Friday’s
Tri-Union Bar night.
The Bottle now sits at its right-
ful place in the Union Bar, whilst
the violate RSM mascot, Davy, re-
mains missing, but they now hold
the CGCU Spanner. Chris, the giant
RAG collecting tin is also missing.
The CGCU currently hold neither of
their mascots after Bolt was taken by
inebriated Scientist in another embar-
rassingly easy capture by the RCSU
during the CGCU Bonfire bar night in
November.
One detachable third of Theta re-
mains in Guildsmen’s hands. It was
taken from the felix office after Sab-
batical Scientist and felix Editor Dan
Wan chose a poor hiding place for it.

T
he European Commission’s competition regulators have opened
a preliminary antitrust investigation into Google, according
to both the commission and the company. The commission
received complaints about Google from Foundem, a British price
comparison website, Ciao.de, a Microsoft owned shopping site, and ejustice.
fr, a French legal search site. Each complaint was slightly different in na-
ture but centred around Google’s search ranking methodology or advertising
terms and conditions. Google was notified earlier in the month by the EU
about the probe and has been asked to respond to the allegations brought
forth. Intriguingly, there already seem to be quite apparent connections from
Microsoft, no stranger to EU competition regulation, and two of the com-
plaining companies. Microsoft has made huge investments into its search
engine, Bing, only to see Google’s dominance grow both in search and in ad-
vertising, most notably in Europe. Recent statistics from Seomoz claim that
85% of search engine referrals to other websites come from Google, a figure
significantly higher than any claims by Google itself.

he creator of Twitter, CEO
of eBay, head of Mozilla, and
Ashton Kutcher were sent to
Russia in a delegation sum-
moned by U.S. Secretary of State Hi-
lary Rodham Clinton. The delegation
was aimed at discussing how social net-
works, new media, and communication
tools can improve ties between the two
countries. The delegation followed similar ones to both Mexico and Iraq,
which led the Iraqi Government to establish a YouTube channel as well as
the Mexicans establishing an SMS crime hotline. The delegates met with
Russian ministers, presidential advisors, business leaders, as well as health,
welfare, and anti-corruption activists and discussed technological collabo-
ration, cyber crime, health, governance, and cultural collaboration. Russia
is the biggest consumer of social networks per capita, according to Com-
score, which stated that the average Russian adult spends 6.6 hours a month
on social networking websites.

NCF, operator of the majority of the French rail network, in-
cluding the TGV, has come under great criticism for circulat-
ing signs warning about baggage thefts by Romanians, stating
that “all acts by Romanians must be reported” to the railway’s
security staff. Romanians in France are reportedly outraged by the signs,
labelling them an example of “anti-Romanian racism”. A rail workers un-
ion made similar statements against the signs. The event has raised larger
questions of relations between France and Romania, as well as Italian-
Romanian relations. A sizeable portion of the French population opposed
Romania’s entrance into the EU and Silvio Berlusconi, Italian Prime Min-
ister, controversially singled out Romanians in trying to explain crime
levels in his country. The signs were apparently made by a rogue railway
agent and the organisation promised to evaluate how their creation was
possible. SNCF security stated that no reports of Romanian activity had
been received following the posting of the signs.
