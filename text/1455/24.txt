Basso and Brooke’s signature colourful
print, this time not far from an Indian
mythical cartoon. The game is down to
the duo and Mary Katrantzou. Some
toned down pieces such as an elegant
swooped line body-con dress worn
with print leggings. Albeit not many
surprises here, still a good collection.
Huggable as marshmallow and elegant
as swans, Shao-yen Chen, an MA
graduate of CSM has created a stun-
ningly beautifully knit collection. Raf-
fia exploded in amazing volume and
in ripples of tranquil layers that curve
around the body. 10 stars. Absolutely.
They have definitely lost it. A collection
inspired by the immaculate 80s and the
clothes look dirty and untidy. Random
fur trims that resemble mice peeking
out from a pile of unwanted items in a
charity shop. The only desirable item
was a pair of open toe vagina boots that
are made out of rings of strings.

********* **
Queen Victoria’s many household ob-
jects printed on immaculate dresses.
Epaulettes so vivid that you almost
think they are real. 2D surrealism was
gradually replaced by explosive layers
of lace and ruffles of printed fabrics.
You can almost hear the printed pearls
rattle. Awesome.
Think golden leaves falling in a setting
sun. Think seasonal birds flying across
a maroon sky. Think snowflakes fall-
ing in a romantic Swedish woods. The
poignant images were embroidered
onto bell-shaped dresses. All very
mademoiselle-esque. Beautiful.
Nathan Jenden has done extremely
well for himself after quitting DVF
on Valentine’s Day. A hybrid of seri-
ous boardroom uniform and (skin of)
safari animals. Kaleidoscopic mono-
chrome makes your head spin. He even
made snood-hoods elegant! Alterna-
tive power dressing.

The figure hugging persian blue dresses
have hidden hoola-hoops underneath.
Anja has sewn an eclectic edge onto
the traditional crinoline dresses. The
beautifully structured dresses are remi-
niscent of the techno pieces sold in Cy-
berdog. Only more elegant.
Christopher Bailey battles UGG to be-
come the biggest endorser of sheepskin.
Deranged fur lined buckle boots. Avia-
tor jackets lined with 2-inch thick of
sheepskin. Humungous pea coat in bear
fur that would dwarf Andre Leon Talley.
Burberry – the shop for coats in 2011.
Hole punched dresses ala the IBM
punched card for a calculator that
Richard Feynman used to design the
A-bomb. The dresses are precisely
cut with laser. The blockey panelled
collection emulates the sombre mood
of the digital apocalypse. Jonathan
made windbreakers desirable.

S
tarting with David Koma,
the scene was set for a
very geometric, mono-
chromatic Autumn/Win-
ter season. As seems to be
his speciality, Koma chose
a theme, zig-zag patterning, and fol-
lowed it through his entire collection
with varying success. Set in a palette of
black, nude and gold, the spiky, body-
con, futuristic-inspired collection
somewhat echoed his last, pushing the
theme perhaps a little too far for an
entire collection although individually
the pieces looked well-made, thought-
ful and imaginative, with leather and
suede breaking up the wool base to
create some textural interest. Expecta-
tions were high for this designer who
catapaulted to success last year and
perhaps we expected more, but I’m
sure many of his celebrity fans will be
delighted with a piece from this col-
lection as the cuts are flattering and
wearer-friendly.
Bodyamr also showed at Vauxhall
Fashion Scout, with a celebrity-heavy
front row complete with Rachel Ste-
vens, Nicola Roberts and Hilary Alex-
ander. The designer, Amr Ali, contin-
ued to showcase his vision of women
as “sexually empowered warriors” with
a variation of cutting techniques, from
his signature draping to body con-
scious mini-dresses. Colour was kept
minimal but interesting with ombré
effects and screen printing of draping
creating a trompe l’oeil print for some
of the dresses. The eveningwear was
indeed empowering, Greek goddess
like and beautiful – plus, the models
were “normal-sized” with womanly
Marilyn curves and walks full of atti-
tude and power.
Over at the BFC Show Space, Sass
and Bide kept it geometric and mono-
chrome but with much more complex
patterning and prints, and with that
signature sexy bohemian chic. Featur-
ing cutouts and emphasis on strong
shoulders adorned with metallic fab-
rics or fur, the fabrics were kept tactile
and sensual with lace and cotton jersey
hugging each curve (read: bone) of the
models. The outfits were beautifully
accessorised with tribal printed mini-
capes with feather fringing and opera-
length fingerless leather gloves, and
there were harnesses seen everywhere,
either featuring within the frame of the
garment or over it, often in leather, giv-
ing the collection a sexy hard edge, de-
spite the minimal colour palette.
PPQ also kept their colour story to
a minimum – set completely in black
and gold, the collection was all about
texture – the black tones were varied in
velvet, thick wool felt and silk and the
gold was kept whimsical in touches of
gold leather, lamé and weaved through
gold brocade. Perhaps their designs are
a little simplistic by some standards
– luckily the show was at 8.30pm on
Saturday, the fash-pack weren’t going
to be picky about the nuances of cut
and fit – but PPQ have cornered the
market on easy-to-wear party dresses
for the young and beautiful… Although
without the gold touches the finale
may have seemed no more than a well-
groomed parade of ex-groupies at a
rock star’s funeral.
Colour was lacking again at Todd
Lynn, but this time nobody could have
cared less: the silhouettes were so
beautiful and the menswear so won-
derful that even the queens on the
front row were rendered speechless.
Jackets with fabulously exaggerated
pagoda shoulders were draped in sin-
fully sumptuous fox fur and served as
a means to describe his inspiration:
the hunter becomes the hunted. Cage
symbolism came in the form of woven
leather and also adorned the shoulders
of the elf-like models (did he pick them
on how pointy their ears were? Who
knows.) A wonderful collection in sim-
ple shades of oatmeal and black which
I wouldn’t mind getting my mits on.
Similarly, Topshop Unique showed a
naturalistic collection careering from
a relatively restrained khaki boy-scout
uniform through distressed leather
and shearling coats to the thickest,
longest, cosiest knitwear layered over
“...next winter,
keep it classically
monochrome...
unless you’re
brave enough
for a maximalist
Katrantzou look...”
Mary Katrantzou was inspired by the
opulence of 18th century France.
