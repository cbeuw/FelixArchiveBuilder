Saturday 20 February was meant to be
a free day for Imperial’s 1st XI. Given
the fact that just under half of the start-
ing XI were abroad, captain Mustapher
Botchway had informally agreed with
the RUMS (UCL Medicals) captain to
reschedule the ULU Challenge Cup
Semi-Final to the week after (27 Febru-
ary). However, in attempt to capitalise
on this, the captain had reneged on
this agreement and stipulated that the
game was to take place on its original
date, to avoid conceding a walkover.
A 2-hour public transport journey to
Shenley (Hertfordshire) later, Imperial
were eager to wipe the smile off their
London neighbour’s faces in Imperial’s
biggest game of the season. The semi-
final began in a tense fashion with Im-
perial testing the RUMS defence with
probing long balls. RUMS’ tactic of
using the wings were nullified by the
combative Imperial midfield. RUMS
then tried to resort to using the indi-
vidual talent of their central midfielder
to create opening for their strikers.
Playing a 4-4-1-1 formation, Impe-
rial’s 2nd XI captain and stand in front
man, Damian Phelan lacked the part-
ner he needed to capitalise on his abil-
ity to hold the ball up. Romain Chauvet
went up-front as the ubiquitous 4-4-2
was restored for the remainder of the
half and more chances were created
from the menacing work of left mid-
fielder David Hayes and central mid-
fielder Caspar Paxton who brought an
excellent save from the RUMS UCL 1st
XI keeper on the 35 minute mark.
Five minutes before half time, with
Imperial controlling much of the pos-
session, the RUMS striker intercepted
a pass in Imperial’s third and was
through on goal. The efforts of de-
fenders Patrick McMullen and David
Sapin, with the goalkeeper Botchway
doing just enough to put him off bal-
ance, the striker played a weak shot
towards goal, that centre back Tom
Fryatt cleared with ease.
Imperial played with possession for
the remainder of the half. The team felt
that though they had possession they
were not playing as well as they could,
given the occasion. Incompletion of
passes and the lack of pressing in the
midfield were areas which needed to
be addressed if Imperial were to take
significant control of the game.
The second half started at a high
tempo, with the strategy of pressing
RUMS as soon as they approached Im-
perial’s half being adopted. This pro-
duced frequent changes of possession
that brought an element of unpredict-
ability to the game.
Fifteen minutes into the second half
a RUMS corner was dealt with ineffi-
ciently with Botchway getting finger-
tips to the cross, which slightly deflect-
ed its path towards the striker who was
unable to beat McMullen who cleared
it swiftly.
Theocharis Tofis worked well with
Hayes on the left hand side that creat-
ed more unconverted half-chances for
Phelan and Will Swain up front. Cen-
tral midfielder Jonathan Hill, whose
role this season has been to afford no
space to the opposition midfield, did so
diligently, with well timed tackles and
excellent vision to kick-start Imperial’s
breaks.
With Fifteen minutes to go, some
bright interchange between right
midfielder Mark Smith and Phelan
drew the RUMS defence out of posi-
tion. The ball was played to Hill, who
scored what any footballing fan would
describe as a screamer. Picking the ball
up, he took one touch and shot from
25 yards out, beating the UCL 1st XI
goalkeeper to the top right corner of
Last weekend, three London teams
entered the 18th edition of Sheffield
USIST, the biggest international stu-
dent judo tournament held in the UK.
This team event involves 4 guys and
2 girls fighting in weight order.
This year, 4 students from Imperial
made it into the London A team:
Bronwyn Dawson (-57kg), Edouard
Desclaux (-73kg), Rahul Bose (-81kg)
and Ben Browne (-90kg). Sarah Taylor
from UCL (+57kg) and Constantine
Lerounis from King’s College (+90kg)
completed the line-up.
The two other London teams, Lon-
don B and C were also mostly drawn
from Imperial freshers who had just
started judo last term. Given their lack
of experience and the fact that they
were up against players who had com-
peted for most of their lives, our rook-
ies did extremely well.
London B faced very tough opposi-
tion in their pools with the hosts, Shef-
field A and the A team from South-
ampton. While Sheffield proved to be
too experienced, Kwasi and Ualikhan
managed to win their fights against
Southampton.
London C also faced tough opposi-
tion in their first pool fight against
Newcastle A. Despite losing all their
matches they showed great spirit and
fought back well against Nottingham
B.
Captained by Joe Skerman-Gray,
Pasha Normahani nicely caught out
his opponent with a hip throw. Lucien
Copus managed to take his opponent
down into ne-waza (groundwork) and
won his fight with a hold down.
