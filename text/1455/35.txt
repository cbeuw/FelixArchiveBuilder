coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk COFFEE BREAK
FRIDAY 26 FEBRUARY 2010
How to play:
Insert these numbers into the grid to on
the next page, from left to right and top
to bottom, in the unshaded cells (left by
solving the ‘Nonogram’). Then proceed as
normal for a ‘Slitherlink’.
It’s quite simple, all numbered cells
must be surrounded with a correspond-
ing number of edges. There may only be
one continuous line. Any cells without a
number can have any number of edges.
Winner is Matthew Colvin well done.
Your mother must be very proud of you
Matthew.

Nonolink 1,455
Winner of both last week’s Nonolink and
Slithergram 1455 was Sophie Lambrakis.
Nice to see you getting involved. Or something
like that. I don’t care here or there really to be
brutally honest. Fill thin line with more text
......... done.
Send your solutions to us at
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Solving and submitting the Nonogram half
of this puzzle only is acceptable: points are
awarded separately.
