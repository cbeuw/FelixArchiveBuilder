The strutters who set trends; why London is crowned the Fashion Capital
Amendment: In last week felix’s Alexander McQueen tribute, a portrait was incorporated and it was drawn by Ting Zhang. Her name was misprinted as Tina.
Sans lightsabers but armed with quilted
protective clothing – Louise Goldin, a
fashion forward winner and a Topshop
collaborator – spent months in an Ital-
ian factory creating hexagonal-shaped
dresses and cotton armour complete
with padded bullet proof panels.

Apparently Carine Roitfeld flew in
especially for this man. His dresses
incorporate highly charged sexuality
in your typical suit fabric. Panels
twist and turn to confer some serious
structure and sophistication. Natalia
Vodianova graced the catwalk for this
until now, relatively unknown designer.

STRUCTURED
beautiful chiffons printed with
mushrooms. A collection full
of originality and wit, Karen
Bonser even managed to take
the distinctly un-fashion-y oil-
cloth fabric and cut it into a
covetable fitted utility jacket,
a fully-fledged transformation
of a well-loved country classic.
Models were clad in thick cable
knit thigh-high socks in vari-
ous muted tones of grey, khaki,
cream and blue paired with
furry pom-pom adorned patent
boots, unthinkably incongru-
ent yet perfectly matched. For
a show so full of imagination
and ingenuity, it comes as no
surprise that Katie Grand was
at the helm of the styling team.
Alice Palmer received simi-
lar high praise over at Vauxhall
Fashion Scout – themed “Bat-
man”, her collection was set in
a tight monochrome, complete
with studs adorning the very
covetable black leggings, exag-
gerated shoulders a-plenty and
a stunning studded black all-in-
one fit for a modern-day domi-
natrix Catwoman – all atop
heels complete with deadly sil-
ver spike spurs. Finding inspira-
tion in the advanced engineer-
ing of the Batmobile, Palmer
brought strength and stealth
to her signature knitwear, with
sexy cutouts of bare skin to con-
trast with the powerful lines.
An innovative collection fit for
the coolest punk-rock rich kids
over in Gotham City.
For a much-needed bit of
colour, one never needs to
look any further than Mat-
thew Williamson. Structured
and cocooned coats in sump-
tuous tweed with flouncy fox
fur arms concealed the tell-tale
Matthew flashy print, peeking
through the layers. It’s not that
Matthew has entirely crawled
out of the primordial ooze of
explosive colour which consti-
tutes the essence of his brand
(as already mentioned, flashes
of his instantly recognizable
showy mini dresses and blind-
ingly bright, heavily embel-
lished chiffon and silk frocks
for the tanned and toned on the
red carpet are still there aplen-
ty) but he seems to have finally
put one foot on the shore, once
again building on his aesthetic,
growing and experimenting,
after multiple seasons where it
felt like our boy had plateaued.
While his flirtation with col-
our blocked separates (a ma-
genta wool coat, suede peach
slouchy jacket worn over a
tangerine silk jersey draped
evening column) isn’t exactly
avant-garde in the traditional
sense of the word, it is indeed
something new for Matthew.
Whilst he may have pared it
down to cater to newfound BFF,
ultimate Park Avenue Princess
Olivia Palermo (squarely af-
fixed in the front row), with his
deployment of boiled wools in
(gasp!) muted tones with the
tell-tale prints lurking beneath
every seemingly demure layer,
managed to do so in a way
which adheres to his designer
DNA. And that’s what it’s all
about to survive the rat race
against mother nature that is
the fashion industry: survival of
the fittest, evolving what works
for you personally in harmony
with what works for the world
around you.
The sentiment was echoed
over at Clements Ribeiro, fea-
turing metallic brocades, fur
detailing and beautiful little
printed silk dresses, wonderful-
ly cut and paired with the most
beautiful embellished boots.
The colour scheme was kept
mainly to muted blues, greens
and browns, amalgamated into
abstract prints and paisleys.
However, over on the cat-
walks of one of the leaders of
the print revolution, Mary Kat-
rantzou showed her signature
collection of kaleidoscopic dig-
ital prints. Rococo frills, jewels
and opulent colours dominated
Mary Katrantzou’s fabulous
collection, going totally against
the stream of stark minimalism
seen at many other shows. Tak-
ing elements from both male
and female portraits from the
18th century French period, in-
cluding the jewellery, military
medals and sashes of opulent
jewel-toned fabrics, Katrantzou
created an incredibly beauti-
ful collection full of interest-
ing asymmetric lines and lace
appliqué over the prints – an
intelligent move, for fashion’s
current love affair with the
prints needs to be secured not
as a novelty, but a serious and
important part of fashion’s
history. Indeed, it is crucial to
remember that Alexander Mc-
Queen was also at the forefront
of this print revolution and that
tiring out such a vital part of his
legacy would be an utter disre-
spect. Mary Katrantzou, I sa-
lute you for keeping it fresh and
beautiful.
All in all, my key tips for next
Autumn/Winter are: for colour,
keep it classically monochrome
but add deep colour tones in
plum, navy and terracotta and
muted abstract prints, unless
you’re brave enough to sport a
maximalist Katrantzou print!
Add metallic touches with studs
and plenty of chunky metal jew-
ellery and keep your textures
varied, adding a little leather and
thick swathes of fur into the mix.
Capes of all shapes and sizes will
soon be coming to a high street
near you and shoulders are going
to be bigger and better than ever,
going above and beyond the
puny 80s power-shoulder that
is now so two seasons ago. Fet-
ish-inspired wares will also find
their way into the mainstream
with harnesses, cage-work and
studding being featured so heav-
ily in the shows.

T
hings I’ve checked off
on my list of things
to do once in my life:
hearing first hand
what La Roitfeld thinks of the
Autumn/Winter trends? Check.
Getting papped by Facehunter
and The Sartorialist? Check -
if it ever comes up on either of
their blogs I will truly wet my-
self with glee. Seeing Peaches
Geldof get bitched out by a
bouncer? Check. And at none
other than the PPQ show - “Can
you just stop fucking shouting
– no one knows who you are or
why you’re here.” – she was then
swiftly rescued by a PR. Mistak-
en for someone famous by the
girls at Harper’s Bazaar? Check
– to be fair I was sitting in the
prime seat, front row at Sass
and Bide. Complimented by a
member of the global Vogue
team? Check – Vogue Mexico
and Vogue Italy, no less.
So sit back and relax, as a
trusty Fashion Assistant should,
I’ve done all the hard work for
you – sweet-talked the self-im-
portant PRs, elbowed my way
through the designer handbags,
walked up and down the Strand
in 4” Louboutins and acted my
way into the front row to pro-
vide you with the full run-down
of the Autumn/Winter trends,
as witnessed from the front
lines.

into the monochromatic runways.
