CAN YOU HEAR ME?
Feroz Salam looks at how mobile phones have brought private
conversations into the public space to the annoyance of everyone
L
et me make this abundantly
clear, I don’t want to hear
about your dog’s diarrhoea
problems. It may sound harsh,
but I don’t care if the poor sod is at
death’s door, especially if it involves
you describing his last meal and what
it looked like coming out the other
end. Ever been aurally assaulted by
someone else’s painfully private mo-
bile phone conversation on a bus? I
take the rush hour bus to and from my
home every weekday and this, coupled
with the London Transport network’s
plentiful population of eccentrics, has
exposed me to some of the strangest
conversations I will probably ever hear.
It seems like it was only a few years
ago that you could take a bus or sit in
a restaurant without being battered on
all sides by other people’s one-sided
conversations on phones. That period
of our existence ended when mobile
phones really began to take off - the
good old days when people thought
that yelling down a telephone line
helped the message through to the oth-
er end. Yet in those days, it was only the
self-important businessmen who could
afford to shout their way down Oxford
Street, and the nuisance was ignorable
simply because not enough of us had
the devices for it to be noticeable.
That all changed with the emergence
of cheap monthly plans with free min-
utes. Buses on weekday mornings are a
cacophony of ringing phones and mud-
dled bits of conversation. “Tell him I’m
going to be late, I’ve been stuck in traf-
fic for over an hour now” - lies, I just
saw you get on the bus. Also, lady with
the bag sticking uncomfortably into
my back? I don’t care if “no one is sin-
gle anymore except for you” - I do care
that you’ve been talking continuously
for the last half hour, while standing
right behind me. The fact is, you would
never have these loud private conver-
sations in public before, even if you
were with someone else, and you defi-
nitely wouldn’t have an argument with
your mother to entertain the medley
of students, tourists and lunatics that
make up your average London bus.
The other, obvious, side to the argu-
ment is - why should I be listening in
the first place? These things don’t mat-
ter to me, and I somehow manage to
drown out real conversations - why
can’t I just do the same here and for-
get about it? In a recent study by the
University of York, researchers found
that people pay more attention when
they can only hear one side of a con-
versation. It may be that our brains
get a kick out of trying to complete a
conversation having only heard half of
it, or that the drone of a full conver-
sation is easier to push into the back-
ground than the stop-and-go nature of
a mobile chat, but whatever the reason,
these conversations grate on our ears
much more than normal ones.
I think that the Japanese have the
right idea when it comes to mobile
phone usage in public places - it’s a
cultural taboo. With their habits usu-
ally leading the rest of the world when
it comes to technology, it might not be
long before we see notices advising us
not to answer phones on the bus. In
Germany too, mobile phones are se-
rious business; a man was murdered
there in 1999 for his poor mobile eti-
quette. That said, we might also go the
Spanish way. To quote The Economist
about phone vs. face-to-face conver-
sations: “subscribers in Madrid often
mixed them and even allowed others
to take part in their phone conversa-
tions”. I’d rather walk.
T
his week saw the accidental
birth of a new internet meme
at the expense of some rather
ignorant Facebook users.
I say some, it’s more like thousands
of Stalkerbook simpletons, and it all
stems from their inability to under-
stand a simple principle: Google is a
search engine, not an address bar.
How do you, dear reader, get to Fa-
cebook? Type in Facebook.com in your
address bar? Yes, thought you might.
But a small percentage of Facebook us-
ers actually search for ‘Facebook login’
every time they want to get to the so-
cial networking giant. Now a small
percentage it may be, but because of
the sheer number of users Facebook
actually has, that actually equates to
literally thousands of users.
Of course there’s nothing wrong
with searching for something you go
to regularly, other than the extra step
it requires I guess, but to blindly click
on the first or second result it turns up
without actually looking at the url it’s
sending you to is pure idiocy. I often
wonder who falls for phishing scams,
and now I know, it’s the mental under-
achievers that think they’re web-savvy
but blatantly aren’t.
ReadWriteWeb is a site dedicated to
web apps and technologies behind the
internet. They wrote up an interesting
article about how Facebook might end
up being your universal login for every-
thing you might do on the web, spurred
on by the recent AOL-Facebook part-
nership. Of course a web-savvy site like
RWW has pretty good SEO, meaning
that their post about a universal Face-
book login hit all the right keywords
to propel it up the search rankings for
anyone searching Google for ‘Facebook
login’. Unbeknownst to them this put
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
Another week has been and
gone, but what have we got to
show for it from the world of
technology?
How about the latest in Japa-
nese Granny-scooter technol-
ogy, the Personal Hoverchair?
Yes, that’s right, not content
with the mobility scooters you
see OAPs flying around on in
town centres, research-
ers from Japan’s Kobe
Gakuin University
have bolted a high-
power air jet
to the bottom
of a chair. It-
blasts air
downwards
creating, in-effect, a personal
hovercraft. It only works on
smooth surfaces but they’d be
at home in a mall. Maybe Paul
Bart - Mall Cop 2 will have one
of these bad boys instead of the
so last century Segway?
Not to be out done by the
Japanese, the South Koreans
were in the news this week
too with the announcement
that robot teachers will be in-
vading up to 400 pre-schools
by 2012. The ‘R-Learning’
program should expand into
around 8000 pre-schools and
kindergartens by the follow-
ing year. Of course the Rise of
the Machines should follow by
about 2015 so maybe it’s time
to start stocking up on guns
and ammo.
Samsung got in on the robo-
action too this week with their
Navibot robot vacuum, which
will be gracing European liv-
ing rooms from March. Having
been let out of South Korea,
the little housewife replace-
ment maps out your humble
abode with 30fps video, plot-
ting the most efficient route
to clean up that mess from last
nights ‘lads night in’ beer and
gaming session. Watch out
Roomba, looks
like you’ve
finally
got
some
decent
competi-
tion.
Talking about products
around the home, have you
ever wished for lights that you
can just stick flat on the walls
around corners, or that you
could change the colour of at
the flick of a switch? Well flexi-
ble OLED lighting might be the
key to that dream. ModisTech,
amongst others, is bringing
150mm square OLED panels
to market this year for indirect
lighting applications in lamps,
cars and other places where
LEDs or bulbs are used. OLED
lighting promises more natural
light than can be achieved with
LEDs alone, whilst maintain-
ing their power sipping prop-
erties. Great for the green folks
as well as car modders and
people with fancy lighting in
their kitchens.
Microsoft has been in the
news again this week with up-
dates to its Windows 7 activa-
tion technology. Not sure how
long it’s going to last so by the
time you read this it might al-
ready be circumvented. Game
on hackers.
Microsoft also pushed out
its EU pleasing browser bal-
lot screen this week. It’s been
quite a while since the EU
stuck its oar in, but starting
this week you should be
able to select between
IE, Safari, Chrome,
Firefox and Opera.
Of course if you
haven’t already made
the choice to ditch
IE, you’re not going
to now, so you’ll just
find it an annoyance which you
can thank the European Com-
mission for.
Sony this week got a lot of
camera geeks salivating with
their Alpha compact DSLR
hybrid concept. With the size
and body of a compact coupled
to the interchangeable lenses
and sensor from a DLSR, it
sure sounds like Sony wants
in on the fledgling Micro Four
Thirds market.

A Fistful of
Facebook dimwits
SamuelGibbs
SamuelGibbs Technology Editor
the post squarely in the firing line of
all those Bookface geniuses that search
for ‘Facebook login’ each time, sending
thousands of confused Facebookers
to RWW producing hilarity and utter
stupidity along the way.
Pretty soon the blog comments
started pouring in with frustrated us-
ers complaining that Facebook had
‘changed’. Here’s a few choice ones:
1. ‘The new facebook sucks>
NOW LET ME IN.’
2. ‘I WANT THE OLD FAFE-
BOOK BACK THIS SHIT IS
WACK!!!!!’
3. ‘I was just learning,why
would you mess it up?’
4. Why couldn’t you just leave
well enough alone!!!
Of course this state of affairs prompt-
ed RWW to stick a large block text sign
in the middle of the post telling the
confused Facebookers that ‘This site
is not Facebook’, but even that didn’t
seem to stem the flow of cretins.
Soon the tech community got wind
of this phenomenon prompting it to
spread across Digg, Reddit, Twitter
and blogs like wild-fire, causing anoth-
er deluge of visitors and commenters,
this time ripping the absolute piss out
of the now irate Facebook numpties.
At that point it was clear, this was the
birth of a new internet meme, com-
pletely by accident, but absolutely hi-
larious nonetheless. Now, I hope none
of you reading this fit into the ‘George
W Bush’ class of Facebookers, but if
you are one of them I suggest quickly
turning the page. For the rest of you I
urge you to go to http://bit.ly/Ftech1
and check out the comments for your-
self, just try not to laugh out loud, mkay?
