Kids play: Lego Star Wars 2
Andrew Cook and Tony Plana get to know the lighter side of the dark side
Andrew’s Review of Lego Star Wars 2
“I thought it was moving with laughter, superb graphics, amazine movement and fantastic strategies. It
was very hard to find Episode VI because I went around looking for it and I went outside! Eventually I
found it. I think it’s more violent than the other one and it’s not suitable for kids under three. It was very
hard – even I can’t do it! I think this game is not as good as Lego Star Wars.”

W
hat I love most
about Lego Star
Wars? You know
exactly what is
going to happen
when you push the start button.
You’re going to be playing a game
based on the Star Wars franchise.
And it’s going to be constructed
with Lego bits. It’s Lego... but in
Space!
And that’s what Lego Star Wars
is. Not Lego in Space – although,
of course, it’s that too. What’s more
important though is that it’s simple.
It’s the most basic good versus bad
story ever married with the most
basic block building toy ever. And
simple is good. Simple is always
good.
Superb graphics – second in
Andrew’s list after the jokes which,
despite not quite being of the giddy
intellectual level of BBC Three – or,
say, The Beano – are pitched per-
fectly to the light-hearted feel of the
game in general.
But the graphics. They’re not
FarCry in their scope, nor UT 2007
in their detail, but they’re Lego.
They’re sharp, they’re bright, and
they crucially never get in the way
of the gameplay. Kids don’t want at-
mosphere so thick that you can’t tell
what’s the player and what’s just a
big area of shadow. They just want
to kill stuff with lightsabers.
At the Game On exhibition, cur-
rently showing at the Science Mus-
teum, the older games are more
immediately attractive than the
newer ones, for me. It’s not be-
cause there’s something satisfying-
ly snobbish about refusing to play
any game that has more than two
dimensions – it’s simply because
you only need to look at Space In-
vaders to ‘get’ the entire game. It
has a feeling.
Lego Star Wars 2 has a feeling.
Every level – whether it’s bombing
around the desert town of Mos Eis-
ley or trying to work out what’s go-
ing on in the Battle Of Hoth – flows
from one section to another without
feeling too restrictive.
If you’re expecting non-linearity,
though, this is the planet where you
get off, because Lego Star Wars 2
is the complete opposite. In fact,
if you expect anything less than a
run-through of the titular Original
Trilogy of films, you’re going to be
more disappointed than the last
Stormtrooper to be picked for the
annual hoverball match.
But again – that’s why the game
works. There are no complications
“These aren’t the droids you are looking for. Move along.”
Play Again?
Despite the increase in availability
of purely child-audience games
for PC and handhelds, they all
seem to be pretty rubbish rip-offs
of each other, or of ‘classic’ titles
(such as Mario). Children may be
easily entertained at first, but the
shallowness of these games soon
shows through and they are soon
tossed aside. Taking the recent
Finding Nemo game for GBA as
an example, it is just a clone of a
maze-based game from yesteryear,
with exceedingly similar ‘puzzles’
and small changes to surroundings
as the game progresses.
However, is that not what all
(single player) gaming is? FarCry;
a recent hit PC game is basically
(read: cynically) a clone of Doom,
with islands and hired grunts
instead of the walls and zombies?
This may be an over simplification
as there are differences, such as
much better graphics & physics,
jeeps & boats as well as the AI
players you fight with, but the gen-
eral gist is the same: shoot guys
and run.
New, inventive, games and game
types are needed to stimulate the
kids’ games market if it wants to
improve the quality of it’s output,
and make the parents want to
play the game as well (as many
‘children’s books’ such as Harry
Potter and His Dark Materials
have done). The game design
(quality of writing) will be what
pulls the parents in and hooks the
children, not the characters and
big names which is the major force
currently. Detractors of computer
games may brandish even these
children’s games as BAD AND
EVIL, harming children’s health.
The initiative therefore lies with
the hardware makers to ensure
their point is null, as with the
Nintendo Wii where physical move-
ment is encouraged, nay, required,
to do well.
Look familiar? There’s a reason
Everything aside, children’s
games will still get lots of sales
because children want everything
and anything to do with a certain
show/movie/toy, so even if it only
gives a little bit of entertainment,
does quality really matter to the
child?; probably not. The parent
however will probably be frustrat-
ed that the toy (as with all toys) is
never touched after a month.

once you take up your lightsaber
and step into the robes or fur of the
franchise’s finest – you’re here to
play pretend, and nothing else.
It’s interesting to consider what
kids games really are. When you
look at Lego Star Wars 2 – rated 3+
by the powers that be – you think
that it’s just blocky fun with no bad
endings. You still respawn every
time you die, and there’s no blood.
But you can pull bits off people.
It’s funny when you first see it,
and it’s not something that’s going
to give the average schoolkid night-
mares given that any Lego-based
experience tends to involve pulling
heads and legs off hapless yellow
men, but the fact that the kids no-
tice it at all says something.
I think it’s often too easy to make
assumptions about young gamers
that are completely wrong. Just as
I’m far too scared to ever play past
the first ten minutes of Silent Hill,
someone half my age knows what
they like and what they don’t like.
They don’t need to be pandered to.
They just need designers to think
about what’s actually fun.
And he’s got a good point. Lego
Star Wars 2 isn’t the result of pan-
dering to anyone – the game’s just
as fun for me to play as it is for any
other self-respecting gamer. But it’s
not quite as good as the original.
Why? Because it’s more Star Wars
and less Lego. And to put a finer
point on it – it’s more Lego Star
Wars and less pure fun injected into
your eyeballs.
It’s still a laugh with an extra play-
er – dropping in and out of any mis-
sion, and lightsabering your best
mate to bits – and unlocking the co-
pious characters is something that
keeps you interested. But it feels
like they’re trying too hard. You
can’t force fun – it just happens.
Force. Anyone?
No, we can’t bear to look either
