Britney Spears
She finally ditched K-Fed,
lost weight and is ready
to make a comeback. OK,
so the partying with Paris
Hilton is a PR mistake,
not to mention a definite
health risk. Maybe she
was just asking Paris' ad-
vice on sex-tape scandal
damage limitation. If she
doesn't make a come-
back, then there'll be a
highly public spiral into
decline. Hopefully the ru-
mours of Justin Timber-
lake and Britney planning
to record a joint album
are true (but don't hold
your breath. You'll die).
Gwen Stefani
Her new single and video
are hot. But her style
these days has gone seri-
ously downhill. And what
is up with that Gucci-style
logo for L.A.M.B. that
she's wearing everywhere
these days. It's so 90s.
Ankle Boots
They make you look like
you have hooves for feet.
Unless you secretly want
to be a woodland deer,
I would say this isn't a
good thing. Although if
you did have those kinds
of aspirations you prob-
ably have bigger prob-
lems than ankle-boots.
For example, the lack of
green spaces in London.

Cult
Also located in Kingly Court, Cult
stocks a range of brands, including
Ringspun, Cheap Monday, Pop, Re-
ligion & Penguin. You can find most
mid-sized street brands featured
in the OC at Cult. A lot of the price
tags will make you choke, but you
can find some key fashion pieces
here. So, if you factor in the amount
of wear you'll get per pound, you
can easily justify the silly prices.

Lazy Oaf
A very twee brand, born as a t-
shirt company, and now expanded
into sweaters and accessories.
They also have a line of designer
toys. As in, toys by Lazy Oaf, not
toys dressed in couture. Although
rather disturbingly Lagerfield has
just designed a range of the figu-
rines wearing Chanel. Who the hell
buys Chanel figurines? If I found
myself round someone's house, and
saw the shelves lined with Chanel
figurines, I'd assume I was stuck
in some sort of crazy horror film
featuring Paris Hilton. There's only
one Lazy Oaf store in London, off
Carnaby Street, in Kingly Court.

Oki-Ni
Oki-Ni clothes are currently a little
too fashion forward. And by fash-
ion forward, I mean totally hide-
ous. They do however have a great
range of footwear, at ridiculous
prices, that only 30-year-old's who
dress inappropriately young can af-
ford. However they have a sale on
at the moment, so take advantage
of the temporarily student-friendly
prices. Or, if you wait until 1-3 De-
cember, they have a sample sale,
with 80% off. Go to www.secretsam-
plesale.co.uk for the sale.

BAPE
OK, arguably so 2003, but still
uniquely awesome! Originating in
Japan, this once difficult to find
brand has a shop on Upper James
Street. Its distinctive patterned
sweaters and jackets are popular
with hip hop artists, in particular
Kanye West (who features in their
Autumn-Winter 06 catalogue) and
Pharrell Williams. Pharrell also
collaborated with Nigo, the creator
of BAPE, on his own BBC (Billion-
aire Boys Club) clothing range.
