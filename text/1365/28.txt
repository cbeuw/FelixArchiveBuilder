The RSM Ladies turned out for
their first match of the season on
Saturday at home against Royal
Holloway 3rds.
Although the opposition tried
their hardest to intimidate us with
their 20 minute warm up session,
we casually looked on from the side
lines with a bottle of White Light-
ning to keep us warm, in true RSM
fashion.
From the start it was clear who
the dominant side were, as we kept
possession in their half for the first
15 minutes of the game. There were
several great runs for goal by the
newly recruited Miss Willy, “Ka`ie
frm Lu`on” and Dasha, who all
worked beautifully upfront through-
out the game.
Encouraging words such as
“Who’s got the fucking post?” and
“Who’s covering this bitch?” could
be heard throughout the match
from MJ Spammy, in goal, who
was awarded champagne moment
for her stunning acrobatic skills in
goal, including a split save in the
second half that would have made
the crudest of you blush.
Towards the end of the first half
the lung burn had set in for most.
The tables may have turned had it
not been for the amazing efforts of
The Crowther, in defence, who eas-
ily regained and dispersed any balls
that came our way with the skill and
power that we mortals can simply
dream about.
The score at half time was still nil-
nil, which did not reflect the effort
the entire team was making but was
more a reflection of the bias umpir-
ing (Mikey and Pikey - tut tut!) that
took place through out the game
(was that 20 short corners?).

After a brief tactical meeting
at half time we were back on the
pitch, coming on strong and looking
to get our goal. It came soon after
half time; a stunning hit from The
Crowther to Els Bells in midfield,
who passed it onto the Willy, who
spanked it to Ka’ie on the post, who
brought home the goal!
With 20 minutes to go and a slowly
dying team, we could have strug-
gled, but for the defensive efforts of
Dawn, Kate, Alice C, Elly and Ally
who repeatedly kept Holloway at
bay. Special mention to Alice R who
ran out every short corner (yes,
all 20 of them!) making sure they
weren’t successful.

stuck around to cheer us on, and to
Pikey and Mikey for umpiring.
Man of the Match was a close call
between Sara and Welshy but Willy
got the last vote which secured her
the dirrrrrty pint. I’d like to thank
everyone for turning up and putting
in such an amazing effort. There
wasn’t a single slacker on the team
(apart from me) which is great go-
ing, and we can’t wait until the next
match!
A note from Alice Rowlands,
Sports Editor:
Charlotte was not “slacking”; she
was working bloody hard through-
out the whole match, hence the
rather red face she was sporting
following the match! (See above)

Something is deeply, deeply, wrong with this picture. Can you spot what it is? If you are, you’re sharper than a number of the Felix team
