Casino Royale: 007 returns
Has Daniel Craig got what it takes to maintain one of the world’s favourite franchises?
The previous James Bond was the
striking Pierce Brosnan who dealt
more with cool machinery than any
real fighting tactics. Daniel Craig
has stepped up to the platform,
chided to be the geek who would
bring the downfall of the 007 series.
But the critics and naysayers have
been proven wrong. Daniel Craig
has brought a new angle to James
Bond. He is tough, lethal, lacking in
etiquette but still a winner with the
ladies.
Casino Royale heats up with a
freezing start in Prague. Accus-
tomed to talk and slick language
manoeuvres, this James Bond is all
about cold-blooded action. Witness
the black-and-white fighting scenes
and the cold gargle of water as a
man takes his last breathe. Swift
assassination skills gain him the
status of a 00 agent. And his first
mission is to track down the terror-
ist, Mollaka in Madagascar.
No prizes for guessing, but things
did not go quite as planned for
James in Madagascar. Instead of
catching Mollaka, he changes tac-
tics mid-strike and blows up the
Nambutu Embassy. The lady, Judi
Dench who resumes her role as M,
is obviously pissed with his wild-
child tactics. She becomes increas-
ingly displeased when she finds out
he’s been breaking every rule in the
007 book.
Daniel Craig as James Bond is a
man on a mission and he has reason
to suspect that he has just latched
on to the core personnel of terror-
ist activity, the Banker. James Bond
follows his instincts to the sizzling
beaches of the Bahamas. Ladies,
there is good news to be heard. This
time, climbing out of the waters, we
don’t have Ursula Andress in her
trademark white bikini. We have in-
stead, the very tanned and sinewy
Daniel Craig. However, there is no
cause for worry gentlemen. Across
the glittering jewel-like waters of
Bahamas, we have the beautiful
Caterina Murino. And she is no less
of a goddess on a white horse.
Caterina Murino takes the role of
Solange, the girlfriend of Dimitrios.
Dimitrios is involved with Le Chif-
fre, banker to terrorist cells. Secret
Service informs 007 that Le Chif-
fre plans to raise money in a high-
stakes poker game at Le Casino
Royale. (Hence, the name.) And so
it is up to James Bond to save the
day by playing his hand against the
poker talents of Le Chiffre.
No James Bond film is truly com-
plete without the cool cars and
gadgets. The internal microchip in
his arm and the classic silver Aston
Martin should be suffice to satisfy
your technological addiction. To
teach him to play poker, M16 di-
als up the service of Vesper Lynd
(Eva Green). Finally, we have an
intelligent, librarian-chic Bond girl
who can meet Bond’s mental and
physical abilities tit for tat. Tension
is high and sporadic bursts of flirta-
tious spats add light-hearted com-
edy to this well-packed action film.
While she does not don leather out-
fits and smash fists with terrorists
aka Michelle Yeoh, she is a Bond
girl in her own right.
Unlike many sequels to well-
known series, you do not have to
watch Casino Royale just to achieve
a sense of completion. Casino Roy-
ale marks the beginning of a new
James Bond era. Daniel Craig, the sixth James Bond, stars in Casino Royale. Out now

Something big or a bit of nothing film?
With a well-worn plot concerning
a mismatched trio embarking on a
seemingly foolproof blackmailing
scheme that could not possibly go
wrong and the relatively unknown
French director Jean-Baptiste An-
drea (JBA) at the helm, you would
understand my initial doubts about
the film. But I was in for a surprise.
Big Nothing tells the tale of Char-
lie Wood, played by David Schwim-
mer, a frustrated unemployed
teacher. He reluctantly teams up
with the unpredictable scammer
Gus Dickinson, played by Simon
Pegg and his ex-squeeze Josie
McBroom (Alice Eve) in a seem-
ingly snag free plan to get rich
quick. Of course, absolutely noth-
ing goes according to plan and to
say ‘things spiral out of control’
would be putting it rather mildly.
Surprisingly, Big Nothing delivers
far more than your average scam-
gone-wrong comedy. The script-
writing duo, a combination of JBA
and American, Billy Asher, have
managed to produce a dark com-
edy that is all at once hilarious, ab-
surd and tense enough to keep you
on the edge of your seat. It plays
like a deliciously twisted fairytale,
reminiscent of the Coen brothers.
It’s visually enthralling story tell-
ing lulls you into a false sense of
security whilst secretly setting you
up for a twist after twist. Richard
Greatrex (Shakespeare in Love,
Mrs Brown) adds a compelling
sense of energy and style with his
often quite beautiful and imagina-
tive shots which works really well
with the director’s dynamic vision.
What really makes the film so fun
is the quirky ensemble of A-listers
and newcomers which comprise the
eclectic cast. I’m a big fan of Pegg’s
comedy genius, having watched
Spaced one too many times and
I have always had a soft spot for
Schwimmer’s character, Ross. Not
an obvious pairing though, coming
from almost opposite ends of the
comedy barrel. Curiously the two
brought out the best bits of each
side without going over the top. If
you’re not a fan of David Schwim-
mer, this might just change your
mind. He gives a grounded, rather
understated performance, which
is a refreshing change, and is ob-
viously enjoying the challenge of
not being Ross forever by explor-
ing his darker side. Felix is happy
to report that he has done it to
great effect. He plays off brilliantly
against Pegg, doing what he does
best, just with an American accent.
Alice Eve brings the threesome
together never failing to charm.
They’re supported by the likes of
Natascha McElhone, Mimi Rog-
ers, who has possibly one of the
most bizarrely wonderful cameos,
and the consitently fantastic Jon
Polito who is so enjoyable to watch.
A highly stylish and entertain-
ing tale of karmic retribution. It
could easily have become ludicrous
and dull, and there are a couple of
moments where it seems to lose
momentum, but thanks to some
inspiring directing and great act-
ing talent it leaves you, somewhat
ghoulishly, wanting just a little
bit more, with a final wicked twist
sure to fire up the imagination and
linger for longer than you’d like.
