I, Gamer
C
hild labour – it’s
the way to go. This
week’s focus on fun
leads us to ask ten
year-old Andrew
Cook what he thinks of Lego Star
Wars 2 – cheap, punctual, and he
even threw in his own illustra-
tions. As long as I keep below
Amnesty International’s radar,
I’m onto a winner.
Of course, we were all like that
once. We did work when we were
told to, we played when we were
told to, we ate what was good for
us. Most of us started as gamers
when we were that age too – and
when you’re young, a good game
is something totally different
to what we now see as being a
great experience.
So this week, Felix Games goes
off in search of smiles and lolli-
pops as we take a look at gaming
then and now.
As a generation of gamers,
the market largely targets us
when they design new titles – but
through doing that, it’s easy to
forget that once upon a time
we liked pretending to be rock
stars using brooms as guitars, or
spent hours and hours build-
ing elaborate fortresses out of
plastic bricks.
Andrew’s review, and Mat-
thew’s article on it, shows that
kids are onto what fun really is.
They don’t necessarily want to
beat the crap out of legions of
bad guys and cackle as the blood
spills. Sometimes they just value
what’s fun – and our comment
this week from James Skuse
claims that we don’t give them
enough credit for doing this.
But fun is making a come-
back – and not just through
the infmaous controller for the
Nintendo Wii, or the block-bash-
ing mayhem of Lego Star Wars.
Peripheral gaming in general
has gained momentum over
the past years, not only secur-
ing the Playstation 2’s success
– as Chris Hemmens explores
overleaf – but also opening up
a whole new style of play, and
a whole new style of gamer, in
the way we interact with our
consoles.
The festive season is almost
upon us, and next week we’ll
be exploring the highs and
lows of what’s to come during
December.
A lot of it is the same old shoot-
ing, slashing and scoring – many
good games, but essentially tired
concepts – so it’s good to see that
both in the near future and ten
years down the line lies a fresh
breed of gaming, as well as an
enthusiastic breed of gamer.

SC4: A splintered game?
James Freedman takes a look at the darker side of gaming and sees the light
Splinter Cell 4 might be good, clean, throat-slitting, terrorist-beating, fun – but it’s not one for the kids
L
ike so many dedicated
fans of Sam Fisher, I’ve
been looking forward
to Splinter Cell: Double
Agent ever since Splin-
ter Cell: Chaos Theory ended in an
orgy of silence and darkness last
year. Ubisoft’s stealth franchise
has been previously extraordinar-
ily successful over across all plat-
forms, offering an intelligent alter-
native to the horde of first-person
shooters flooding the market.
The story takes a slightly more
personal turn than before – fol-
lowing the accidental death of his
daughter, Sam Fisher accepts an
extraordinarily dangerous mission
to infiltrate a terrorist organisation
known as John Brown’s Army. He’s
thrown into Ellsworth Peniten-
tiary to earn their trust by helping
a known member escape. After a
brief introductory mission, the play-
er takes Sam’s role for his escape,
and must gradually earn the JBA’s
trust by helping them prepare a
major attack on several cities. Curi-
ously, JBA seem to have access to
the same technology as the Nation-
al Security Agency, so any players
wishing to see an alternative to the
standard headgear, or the SC20K,
will be disappointed.
Double Agent is powered by the
Unreal Engine 2; whilst levels and
characters are well detailed and the
game does look good, it is difficult to
believe that this is the same Unreal
engine that delivered the vast ex-
panses and beautiful environments
we have been treated to in Unreal
II and Unreal Tournament 2004. In-
dividual levels are incredibly small,
reminiscent of Deus Ex’s downsiz-
ing for its port to Playstation 2.
And not only are they small, but
there also aren’t very many of
them. The Splinter Cell series has
always kept things short and sweet,
and Double Agent is no exception.
There are 11 levels, not including
tutorials, of which two time under
ten minutes, and four are set in the
same building. That aside, every
single level is extremely well de-
signed – the number of pipes, vents
etc. available to circumvent the en-
emy is astounding, and there is al-
ways a way to avoid conflict.
However, there’s a far more se-
rious problem: Even at night, in a
room with all the lights turned off,
the game is still bright. The guards
may not be able to see Sam, but the
player can still clearly see all the
contents of the room. In the entire
game, I barely used night-vision,
never touched the thermal vision
or the ‘wave’ vision (which unlike
previous games, is never required
for an objective). The iconic three
green eyes have been such a staple
of the series since its foundation,
and I was dismayed to find that they
now so surplus to requirements,
that in some missions Sam doesn’t
even bother to wear his headgear. A
high price to pay for a new twist in
gameplay.
The trust system, and the array
of objectives (most of which are
optional, and some of which are
conflicting), allow several different
paths through the game. There are
multiple endings, and these depend
on more than just the last fifteen
minutes of the game. Whilst playing
I genuinely got the feeling that my
choices were affecting the outcome
of the conflict – and although I had
no problem keeping my trust with
both organisations at a respectable
level – some of my decisions had
notable permanent effects – with-
out giving too much away.
So while Splinter Cell: Double
Agent seems on the whole to be
an improvement, even with these
shortcomings, it has several far
more fundamental problems that
make the entire experience intense-
ly frustrating. The ragdoll physics
are appalling – an enemy shot in
a chair will often end up perched
above the chair, some become stuck
in a wall on their way to the ground,
and occasionally a corpse will just
remain floating in the air. It is ex-
tremely difficult to place a corpse in
the sparse and small dark spots so
necessary for concealing them, and
on one occasion, when I had a pile
of unconscious enemies ready to
dump off the edge of an iceberg, all
but two of them disappeared.
I found Splinter Cell: Double
Agent to be a frustrating, disap-
pointing but still thoroughly enjoy-
able game. It was only at the end,
when I was treated to soundbites
instead of a cinematic, that I noticed
the absence of videos throughout
the game.
The brilliant faux news footage
of previous stories has been re-
placed by faceless talking, and this
is symbolic of laziness and apathy
with which the whole product was
put together. The care lavished on
Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow
and Chaos Theory by Ubisoft Mon-
treal seems incomprehensible to
the European continental develop-
ment team responsible for Double
Agent. Make no mistake, I had a
great time playing this game. I feel
as if I got my money’s worth, and
I will still look forward (although
somewhat apprehensively) to the
next episode of what may now be
a tired franchise. But I will always
pine for the astounding game that,
with a little more love an affection,
it certainly could have been.
