A psychotic death cult?
L
ast week Samuel Lynas
shared his thoughts on
Muslim military conduct
during the fall of Constan-
tinople, the subject of an
article on Imperial’s Islamic Society
(ISoc) website. Unfortunately, his
account of this historic event is both
misleading and misinformed. Pre-
dictably, his conclusion – ISoc cel-
ebrates barbaric ‘unprovoked Mus-
lim conquests’ – suffers accordingly.
Muslims agree that war is not good
per se but nonetheless maintain that
it can, at times, yield a greater good
for humanity: such was the under-
standing of Sultan Mehmet II.
The siege of Constantinople was
not, as was suggested, an unpro-
voked imperial raid, but can be justi-
fied by the standards even of ‘decent
people’ today. The Byzantine Em-
pire had actively encouraged and
facilitated Crusaders in their crimes
against the peoples of the Levant,
indiscriminately slaughtering not
only Muslims, but Jews and other
Christians as well. The capture of
its capital created a buffer zone be-
tween the Anatolian plate and main-
land Europe, thereby ensuring the
safety of its citizens. In addition, the
Byzantine emperors were oppress-
ing their own subjects, over-taxing
the poor and persecuting religious
minorities. It would have been a cry-
ing shame indeed for any authority
to stand by in face of such atrocities.
History demanded intervention.
This, evidently, was also the view
of contemporary Europeans: not a
single European nation, leader or

authority assisted the Byzantine
ruler during the siege of his capital.
Their silence here was not a protest
against foreign invasion, but consent
to the arrival of a much-welcomed
force.
Lynas described the blood bath
that the invading army made of
Constantinople’s citizens with the
accompanying ‘rape, pillage and en-
slavement of the defeated peoples’.
How could a prophesized Muslim
army behave in such an inhumane
manner? The short answer is that
they didn’t. Lynas seems to have
based his gory account solely on the
uncritical adoption of Steven Run-
ciman’s ‘The Fall of Constantinople
1453’, a book which has little, if any,
academic authority in the field of
Ottoman history. Not only does this
author lack command of the Otto-
man-Turkish language (a pre-req-
uisite for access to reliable archival
material) but his work is poorly ref-
erenced with sources that are false,
biased or out-of-date. Had Lynas
made reference to established
scholars of Ottoman Studies, like
Stanford J. Shaw and Halil Inalcik,
the story of the conquest would have
been dramatically different and far
closer to the truth than Runciman’s
politically motivated description.
For example, in contrast to Run-
ciman’s portrayal that the Muslim
invaders ‘slew everyone that they
met in the streets, men, women
and children without discrimina-
tion’, Stanford Shaw in his ‘History
of the Ottoman Empire’ informs us
that ‘Mehmet kept his troops under
H
aving already bored
the pants off anyone
who’s tried reading
felix over the past
fortnight, let’s all be
grateful that this whole ‘NUS refer-
endum’ bollocks, er I mean debate
is finally over and done with. Per-
haps now I’ll be able to walk down
the walkway without being accost-
ed by someone wearing a monkey
outfit and an nus t-shirt trying to
tell me how to vote. Anyway whilst
ploughing through some of the gar-
bage written in felix by some so-
called campaigners – most of whom
appear to have never written more
than two consecutive sentences
before, I was struck by a couple of
quotes from some Very Important
and Distinguished People. For in-
stance I was somewhat perturbed
to see Gemma Tumelty, NUS Presi-
dent, exclaiming to us “You are not
my member” – well thank god for
that, or else her picture would have
been pretty misleading.
Perhaps more shocking however
was the statement written by the
Rt. Hon. John Collins that “We could
spend our newly acquired £79,000
on beer but… I would suggest that
is not a mature or inclusive way
of allocating iCU’s resources”…
what? Come again? Not mature or
inclusive? What could possibly be
more socially inclusive than having
a successful, thriving social scene
centred around a popular and well-
frequented union bar? A bar which
students flock to for a quick plough-
man’s and orange juice at lunch, a
couple of beers in the evening to dis-
cuss the day’s equations and finally
a great night out accompanied by a
few snakebites on a Friday night. A
bar renowned for its friendly and
exciting atmosphere! Yes, in case
anyone hadn’t noticed, the above
is a picture of a typical university
student bar, replicated many times
throughout the country, and which
we sadly don’t have a great copy of.
Don’t get me wrong – I don’t think
the union bars are bad as such, de-
spite the best efforts of last year’s
sabbs to turn DaVinci’s into a clinic,
thoughtfully ripping out the carpet
and replacing it with grey plastic
– however not many people would
argue that the affirmation that it’s
certainly not as good as it could be,
or even as good as any other Lon-
don union bar – why? Because not
enough people go there. How can
you make more people go there?
Cheaper drinks, its as simple as
that. The union bar is surely a vital
service which the union provides us
students rather than a way to milk
us out of our precious little cash
so they can throw it all at clubs &
societies.
On the other hand charging stu-
dents £2.05 for a Grolsch or £3 for
an Old Rosie, in a bar supposed to
be run for students by students, and
then expecting people to flock to it
is madness, unless you have a re-
ally nice set-up, like LSE or Kings,
or at least a wider mix of people
and genders than we do at Impe-
rial. It is especially painful to have
to shell out this much when the cur-
rent Deputy President (Finances
& Services) last year promised,
if elected, to lower drinks prices.
He also stated immediately after
his election that he would seek to
“correct the unacceptable increase
in bar and events prices”. Well, ei-
ther due to convenience or sheer
incompetence, it seems the very
same man has overseen a situation
where we’ve come back to find that
prices have actually gone up since
last year – thanks Jon Matthews,
we’re all really happy we voted for
you, and don’t feel at all betrayed!
Oh well, on the plus side this should
at least serve to expose the weak-
ness of the union election system,
in which the sabbs do not appear to
be held to account for anything they
promise in their manifesto.
Student politicians: hang them all now!
firm control, killing only those Byz-
antines who actively resisted’, i.e.
soldiers. The merciful entry of the
Ottomans was such that ‘decrees
were issued guaranteeing protec-
tion of the lives and properties of all
inhabitants, regardless of religion’.
So welcomed was the Ottoman con-
quest of the city that ‘Muslims, Ar-
menians, Jews, Greeks, Slavs, and
others came from all parts of the
empire. Many Jews were attracted
from as far away as Western Europe,
where they were being subjugated
to a new wave of persecution at this
time’. Why would all these people
come to the new Ottoman adminis-
trated Constantinople if conditions
were as bleak as Runciman had
described? Such was the religious
tolerance of the Ottomans that ‘the
Greek clergy were exempted from
taxes and left in charge of Church
administration. The danger here
is not in remembering worthy con-
quests like that of Constantinople,
but in writers ‘unfamiliar with the
history’ misconstrue the evidence
at hand and thereby portraying Is-
lam as a ‘psychotic death cult’. The
key to overcoming such obstacles
is to educate ourselves about what
Islam actually teaches rather than
taking wholesale media misrepre-
sentations like Lynas’ article. (Eve-
ryone is welcome attend ISoc events
for this purpose). This is why ISoc
must be encouraged in their efforts
to highlight humanity’s struggle
against tyranny and not bow down to
the pressures of unqualified pseudo
historians.

I
’m no authority on statis-
tics, and even less aware of
current thinking on social
psychology but when I be-
came a warden a few years
ago, I had always imagined that a
sample of 270 people would be a
reasonable representation of the
graduate population. (OK, I know,
its hardly scientific and it’s really
a very small sample of the whole,
but 270 is a big number as far as
I’m concerned – especially when
they’ve discovered absinthe…) I
had tacitly assumed that one year
would be largely like the others. Of
course, basing any assumptions on
such weak statistical evidence is
bound to produce some eye-open-
ing conclusions: Did you know in
my time as warden, of the great
family of Wilsonites I’ve known,
there is likely to be at least one
who will serve time at Her Majes-
ties Pleasure? Or that there are
perhaps thirty who would admit to
supporting Manchester United. I’m
not sure which is worse…
Experience has taught me only
one maxim: Every year is dif-
ferent. Some years have been
noisy– which presents its own
problems but creates a fantastic
atmosphere. Other years have
been highly competitive – both in
the conventional sporting sense
and the social sense. Some years
are quieter but no less sociable
for that. Even the use of the hall
facilities changes. Some years
the TV lounge is the centre of hall
life, other years it’s the entrance
foyer. Sometimes it’s the area just
outside the hall – possibly to watch
our exotic neighbours ply their
trade! Part of the whole Wilson
experience is the sheer variety of
life here: Minutes from the wealth
of Hyde Park and Marylebone,
yet yards away from the seedier
side of life in Paddington, with its
largely vice based economy. Such
a refreshing change from the her-
metically sealed sterility of South
Kensington and it environs!
It is impossible to say why there
are these differences, but some
things stay the same. Throughout
my time, Wilson House has been
blessed with hardworking sen-
iors and dedicated wardens and I
thank each and every one of them
for making Wilson House what it
is today – a home for some of the
brightest, friendliest students I’ve
ever met. What’s more, it gives me
a lot more interesting things to say
at dinner parties than my day job ),
especially when my list of anecdo-
tal statistics has dried up.
