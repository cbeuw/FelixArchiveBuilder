numbers, this means more than
4,000 students voted.
Though many around the Union
had been predicting a landslide ei-
ther way, the final result came very
close, with only 261 votes separat-
ing the two camps.
As the results were announced,
John Collins, Union President and
supporter of the Yes campaign,
let out a deafening yell. Ben Har-
ris, Deputy President (Education
& Welfare) jumped to his feet, and
Gemma Tumelty (NUS President)
looked stunned. The No campaign-
ers present, including CGCU Presi-
dent James Fok and Live! Editor
Ashley Brown, met the result with a
resigned look. A few students in the
bar were confused as to what was
happening, asking this reporter
what election had just been held.

Students say yes to NUS
Imperial College Union will affiliate
to the National Union of Students
(NUS), pending approval by the
NUS conference, after the refer-
endum result was announced last
week as “yes”.
After three days of dedicated
campaigning by both sides, the re-
sults were announced last Friday
night in Da Vinci’s. The final result
showed 53% of those who voted
chose to vote yes to the question:
“Should Imperial College Union af-
filiate to the NUS?” 47% voted no.
The result has some historic sig-
nificance, drawing the highest turn-
out of any referendum or election
in living memory, with final turnout
standing at just over 30%. In real

John Collins, Union President,
said he was “delighted [with] what
has become the largest union
democratic exercise ever to take
place at Imperial”. Collins also had
words of praise for both camps: “I
would like to thank both Alex Guite
and James Fok for organising bril-
liant campaigns, Live! and Felix for
co-ordinating a balanced debate,
and I would like to commend Jon
Matthews, the Returning Officer,
for keeping a lid on what has been
an explosive and heated week of
banter.”
Alex Guite, the leader of the Yes
campaign, commented to Live!,
the CGCU online newspaper: “This
is an awesome result for Imperial
students. It’s right that as we move
into our centenary year that we’re
back where we belong: leaders not
followers in the national student
movement. We ran a clean and
positive campaign, over the last
two weeks we’ve put up hundreds
of posters and spoken to thousands
of students. Thanks to all those who
voted yes to discounts and yes to a
stronger Imperial College Union.
Thanks also to those students who
campaigned tirelessly for the yes
campaign and thanks also to the no
campaign for making it an enter-
taining referendum.”
On the other side, James Fok,
the leader of the No campaign and
CGCU President, said: “I firmly be-
lieve that this is not the right deci-
sionforus,andthatthemoneycould
be better spent elsewhere. Since
the formation of the NUS, Imperial
and its students have never had a
good lasting relationship. However,
our students have spoken, so our
sabbatical officers must work hard
to get value for money from the
NUS and push for the reform they
have agreed it needs.”
The Union has never affiliated to
the NUS for more than 12 months
at a time, with affiliation motions
usually followed by disaffiliation in
the following academic year. Rum-
blings have been heard from the No
campaign, promising a disaffilia-
tion petition next year. As it is, the
No campaign are resolved to make
sure the Union now makes good on
its promise to reform the NUS from
the inside, according to one anony-
mous A-NUS member.
The referendum was not without
its fair share of problems, and Fe-
lix eargerly awaits the report of the
Returning Officer.

those back at NUS HQ know the result; Alex Guite (leader of the Yes campaign) embraces Ms Tumelty; and Stephen Brown, vocal No campaigner, expresses his dissatisfaction
