Tony Blair has burst onto the sci-
ence stage, campaigning for a
greater prominence in today’s
society.
The Prime Minister delivered a
speech to the Royal Society in Ox-
ford, and gave an interview to New
Scientist magazine on the subject.
Sir Richard Sykes, Rector of Impe-
rial College, wrote a paper for the
Prime Minister to prepare on the
subject.
The move came as a decline in
the number of science students be-
came evident. Tony Blair said: “We
need our young people today to em-
brace science enthusiastically, to
realise that challenges like climate
change can only be beaten by moti-
vated and dedicated scientists, and
to understand that a career in sci-
ence today is not a life all spent in
a laboratory but has the best busi-
ness and job prospects the mod-
ern world can offer. Science today
abounds both with noble causes
and with glittering prizes: reach out
for them.
“We need our scientists today to
be as celebrated and famous as our
sportsmen and women, our actors,
our business entrepreneurs. Scien-
tists are stars too. This is Britain’s
path to the future, lit by the brilliant
light of science.”
To follow up the Prime Minister’s
comments, Felix spoke to Profes-
sor Lord Robert Winston, the cel-
ebrated fertilisation expert. Prof.
Winston said that the problem fac-
ing science in modern society was
cultural, and that scientists should
“stop talking about science and the
economy”, he also said: “Scientists
come across as being dry, cold and
unethical, and that is our fault.”
He drew attention to the fact that
scientists are sometimes perceived
as being arrogant and speaking
down to people. This view point is
also held by Mrs. Justine Jones,
an expert on public speaking who
works with Imperial’s Maths stu-
dents, she said: “When commu-
nicating love of science in Maths,
remember it is your challenge to
make the people you’re speaking to
feel smart.”
Prof. Winston noted that it was
not ‘cool’ to know about science,
that for many people the social
standard when it came to science
was to claim ‘I don’t know anything
about that.’
Your reporter took up the chal-
lenge of putting this opinion to the
test. He asked many people what
they knew about maths, the vast
majority responded by saying that
they ‘don’t know about that’. By
comparison, very few claimed to
know nothing about music or film,
and not one claimed to be illiterate.
So how is this issue being ad-
dressed? Oneschemethathasbeen
particularly successful is ‘Maths
Matters’, based at the Maths de-
partment at Imperial College. Un-
der the scheme students work with
Maths department staff, Exscitec,
who also work with the Pimlico
Connection, and public speaking
expert Justine Jones to prepare ex-
citing presentations based on their
own mathematical studies. The
presentations aim to inspire pupils
by showing how mathematics is key
to many developments in society at
large, and are delivered to school
pupils around London. The pres-
entations are often politically rel-
evant, for example, one presenta-
tion last year showed how maths is
used in disease modelling, and was
delivered at the time of the Bird Flu
scare.
The scheme has received 100%
positive feedback, and students
had to be protected by the college
from demand by schools that could
potentially have damaged their
studies.
Kam Cheng was a member of the
‘Sexy Maths’ team, the precursor
to Maths Matters and has stayed
with the scheme, now helping a
new generation of presenters. He
recalls how cauliflowers were the
unlikely link between sexy and
maths: “With the help of a brilliant
speaking coach who also advised
on how to capture the audiences’
imagination, my group was able to
create a presentation that involved
Powerpoint slides, visual aids and
interactive props, thus covering all
the bases when it comes to teach-
ing a new concept and making sure
it sticks.
“The first school my group were
invited to was a Catholic faith sec-
ondary school. The kids were very
well behaved and were braver than
we had planned for; every time we
needed a volunteer from audience,
many hands would be raised (al-
though the lure of chocolates as a
reward always helps, I guess!) Even
handing out bits of cauliflower (yes,
a cauliflower) for the kids to peruse
over did not result in mayhem or
destruction. In fact, they were fas-
cinated by how maths could be ap-
plied to the real world; at the end we
were asked questions ranging from
‘What is the food like at university?’
(Clearly inspired by the sight of
the cauliflower), to whether people
used maths in to solve crimes, like
in a TV series.”
Kam went on to speak at oth-
er schools including inner city
schools, the pupils of which he de-
scribes as who he describes as “the
kids we were aiming to encourage;
those that may not have thought
about further study, let alone fur-
ther study in maths.” He also said:
“Using props not only brings to life
what numbers cannot, but also it
provides a chance for interaction
with the audience, something es-
sential when you are dealing with
an audience who have a short at-
tentions span.”
Viki Howse, a colleague of Kam’s,
said that she had gained confidence,
public speaking skills, and learnt
how to explain complex problems
to people with less experience on
the subject, she also added: “We
encourage to kids to continue stud-
ies in science and maths… We’re
answering the questions that teach-
ers hate.”
One of the main enabling factors
in this success has been the level of
support provided. Professor Darryl
Holm of Imperial College’s Maths
department first thought of the idea
when Sir Richard Sykes called for
outreach programme involvement
in 2005. Prof. Holm said: “An e-mail
went round asking for volunteers to
take part in outreach programmes,
but the suggestions were along the
lines a soccer league or a charity
sale.
“Justine and I had just helped a
bunch of 2nd year students with a
presentation they were giving on
mathematics. They improved so
much, and so quickly. I just thought
that there were all these students
making very good presentations for
their course that would just sit on
the shelf once they got their marks.
“Why not come up with a pro-
gramme that involved academics
doing what they actually do?”
The idea was further developed
by Minna Ruohonen of IC Volunteer
Centre who helped turn the idea
into practice by providing contacts
with external training, CRB checks
and funding.
Felix asked Justine Jones what
sort of person should get involved,
she said: “No experience is neces-
sary; you don’t even need to be con-
fident because it’s a learning proc-
ess. Whoever you are when you
walk in, we’ll teach you how to give
presentations and you’ll walk out a
confident public speaker. The one
thing you do need is commitment.”
Alan West of Exscitec, who also
works with the Pimlico Connection,
enabled training and contact with
schools. Students became Science
and Engineering Ambassadors and
received training in presentation
skills over the course of a couple of
months.
A further indication to the re-
markable success of the team came
when they were asked to speak to
the Lighthill Institute of Mathemat-
ical Science (LIMS) and the Lon-
don Mathematics Centre (LMC)
in March 2006, after a meeting be-
tween Prof. Holm and Professor
Lord Julian Hunt, who was then Di-
rector of LIMS. The students were
also asked to take part in ‘think tank’
sessions at the conference that
aimed to bring together university
students and lecturers and school
pupils and teachers. The objective
was to “Bridge the gap at the school
university interface.” Ideas gener-
ated have been shared between in-
stitutions in London and there are
plans for an annual joint event with
LIMS and LMC addressing the is-
sue. Teresa Smart, Project Man-
ager for LMC and Imperial alumni
said: “The conference was very
successful, both sides opened bal-
anced dialogue… [The conference]
is something people still remember
and that gets them speaking.”
The event was co-organised by
Professor Celia Hoyles OBE, the
Chief Adviser for Mathematics at
the Department for Skills and Edu-
cation (DfES) installed by Charles
Clarke in 2004.
Prof. Hunt expressed a desire to
speak to Felix on the issue, but un-
fortunately is occupied in the US.
He did point out that there is now
a similar scheme to Maths Matters
running at UCL.
Dr. Lynda White and Dr. Frank
Berkshire of Maths department
are a particularly innovative pair,
organising undergraduate studies
at Imperial’s Maths department.
Having set up a pioneering course
unit where undergraduates deliver
projects and presentations a few
years ago, which would eventually
provide the material for Maths Mat-
ters and later securing funding for
Maths Matters. A new idea being
puttogetherbythemwithDr.Emma
McCoy, also of the Maths depart-
ment, is to send undergraduates
to schools around London to teach
pupils as part of their undergradu-
ate degree. The scheme is only in
preliminary planning, but has re-
ceived a high amount of interest
from undergraduate students. Dr.
White said that if the course were to
go ahead, admission to the course
would be limited and an interview
process would be necessary.
Science today is facing a problem;
that much is clear. The problem is
in the very culture of scientists who
talk down to those they do not con-
sider to be as enlightened as them.
A lack of communication skills, or
perhaps a lack of will to communi-
cate, that leaves the general public
in the dark over developments in
this area of our culture. Apparently
science needs to realise its place
as another part of culture just as
arts such as music, film and thea-
tre are.
Felix asked Prof. Winston what
advice he would give to students
wanting to be involved in reintegrat-
ing science into modern culture, he
said: “Go to the theatre, read lit-
erature, play a musical instrument,
humanities are very important, try
to realise it’s not wrong to do these
things, in fact it’s right.” The ad-
vice raises an important point. Sci-
entists cannot afford to segregate
themselves from modern culture in
the pursuit of science.
On the other hand, it is also ap-
parent that there is a whole com-
munity of very talented individuals
working to resolve the issue. Some
of these individuals are at Imperial
College, and they provide the op-
portunity to students here to suc-
ceed in winning round future gen-
erations to the science as a part of
culture. Others are doing the same
at their various universities and in-
stitutions, and all are open to shar-
ing ideas and discussion.
