After the previous week’s poor per-
formance against South Bank, the
team were anxious to improve and
prove the true ability of the squad.
Similarly to last week, Imperial
came out all guns blazing to score
an early try through, fresher, Dan.
Fletcher couldn’t quite make
the kick, but it seemed like Impe-
rial meant business. Unfortunately,
from the restart the Bucks side
tackled strongly and, with some
impressive counter rucking, turned
over a lot of balls they shouldn’t
have been allowed. Their efforts
were soon rewarded a couple of
minutes later, when they slotted a
penalty in front of the posts.
With the backs trading kicks, af-
ter the restart, it fell to Rob Phil-
lips to make some good penetrative
runs, feeding both wings to make
some much needed yardage. How-
ever well the backs were playing,
the forwards just weren’t providing
an adequate platform for them to
play off. The lineout was uncharac-
teristically poor, with both wayward
throwing and static jumping, the
Bucks team deservedly took pos-
session of the ball.
It became increasingly difficult
for the backs to do much with the
ball as the team was constantly
pinned in our own half. The larger
Bucks pack was making it hard to
win any set piece and it was inevi-
table that eventually we would con-
cede another score. It came from a
scrappy passage of play with some
very poor first tackles from both
the Imperial forwards and backs.
Eventually Bucks found the space
to move the ball out wide. The
only consolation from this score
being that the forwards had held
out against numerous attempts at
catch and drives; something that
had been worked on extensively
during Monday’s training.
With 25 minutes gone, team coach,
Joycey drew on his international
experience (Swedish ladies) to take
the decision to make the back row
more dynamic. With the departure
of Flannan (noticeably unfit and a
little overweight) it fell to fresher
James Petit to bare the burden of
the no. 7 shirt.
The second half closed itself out
with the departure of fresher and
team mullet Dan sustaining a sus-
pected dislocated-relocated ankle.
Dan, in noticeable pain, decided to
try and walk off from one side of
the pitch to the other slowing up
proceedings, but giving the Impe-
rial forwards a much needed water
break. His replacement, Tom Car-
roll, seemed eager and ready for his
second 1st team appearance.
The second half started similarly
to the first with Imperial building
3 or 4 good phases before fresher
James Audford cut through the
centres to score a confidence boost-
ing try. The kick was missed, leav-
ing the score at 10-8 in IC’s favour.
Something stirred within the
Bucks team, and they really began
to make their weight advantage
pay, taking scrums and line outs
at will. It became evident if Impe-
rial were not prepared to man-up in
their tackling, it would be costly and
the game would be lost.
After sustained pressure and nu-
merous catch and drives the Bucks
team were close to the Imperial
line, some strong defending (only
near our try line) prevented a try.
Special mention should go to Andjit
who managed to hold up one or two
try attempts.
Bucks were eventually rewarded
for their efforts and a cheap pen-
alty in front of the posts gave them
3 more points; letting them nudge
into the lead 11-10. It was as if the
fight was out of Imperial as Bucks
reinstated their physical superior-
ity and had us pinned back in our
half. But for a massive let off, where
one of the Bucks players dropped
the ball as he attempted to put
it down over the line, the match
would surely have been taken out
of contention. Only then did Impe-
rial realise the embarrassment that
would ensue if they were to be beat-
en by a side that boasted course ti-
tles such as “International football
management”.
As the half started to close out,
Nathan a.k.a the second heavi-
est man in the squad (after Jov)
was brought on in the centres for
Fletcher. He made an immediate
impact both in the tackle and con-
tact area. Luke Taylor replaced
Owen in the front row and gave the
srum some much needed stabil-
ity. With slightly better platform,
and the Bucks heavies starting to
tire, the team started to play some
better rugby. Fresher Joeseph
my balls-are-more-golden-than-
Fletcher’s Brown made a fantastic
charge down in the Bucks 22, only
to be blinded by his own hair cov-
ering his eyes. The look of surprise
on his face, as he somehow caught
the ball and attempted to scram-
ble for the line, was only matched
by Nathan’s look of disgust as Joe
delayed the off load until he had
managed to trip himself up. Luckily
Nathan managed to hold onto the
pass and crash over the line; for his
troubles some Bucks players felt it
compulsory to jump on him. With
minutes to go Imperial typically
took our collective feet off the gas,
conceding territory to Bucks and
finding ourselves yet again fighting
at our try line. With Bucks needing
a converted try, a lineout wasn’t an
option, so after gaining a penalty
opted for the scrummage. Finally
the pack turned up and a good
shove gave Luke Taylor the oppor-
tunity to cheekily kick the ball out
the scrum, the scrappy play that
proceeded resulted in a knock on by
Bucks. The ref saw this a suitable
moment to end the game. Imperial,
just the victors at 17-11, have a lot of
work to do if we expect to hold our
position in the league. Andjit was
the only player to work hard in all
areas, thoroughly deserved his sec-
ond man of the match this season.

Men’s Football
GKT Men’s 2nd 1
IC Men’s 5th 3
With four games of the season gone,
IC’s favourite football team stood
at a cross-road. Played four; won
2, lost 2. The result of this match
would determine whether 5ths had
won 3 and lost 2 or vice versa, which
meant that it was literally a quite
important game. The opposition be-
fore us – GKT 2’s – had demolished
IC’s 4th
team 8-1 the previous week,
and even though we all know that
the fourth team aren’t really up to
much (3-0, 3-2 – James Skeen, Paul
Notshark, Mike Pursey: your boys
took one hell of a beating; twice)
it was with a degree of trepidation
that we approached this game.
The first 20 minutes went as pre-
dicted – GKT’s classy team ripping
the 5th
’s apart. I think goalkeeper
GAAARRRRYYY put it best when
he said “er, lads, they’re having too
many shots…” Desperate defend-
ing seemed to be the order of the
day, as GAAARRRRYYY kept us in
the game with a string of fine saves
– including a full length dive to tip a
free kick around the post.
With the score (somehow) still at
0 -0 after half an hour; captain Gui
made a surprise tactical change
worthy of Claudio Ranieri himself.
Removing the very impressive Sam
and Chris from a narrow midfield
and bringing on himself and Umut,
and switching from a 4-1-3-2 forma-
tion to a traditional 4-4-2 had an im-
mediate impact as Gui scored with
his first touch after a great through
ball by “Classy” Matty Smith.
It was completely against the run
of play but never mind – IC were in
front!
An ordinary football team might
have attempted to cling on until
half time; but IC 5th
’s are no ordi-
nary football team. Allowing GKT
to pressurise us further, we again
hit them on the break as the ball
broke to Matty in the area and he
won a strong 50-50 challenge with
the keeper before rolling the ball
into an unguarded net – 2-0 IC at
half-time.
IC’s inspirational half time
team talk from QPR’s “Robbo”
helped to bring GKT back into the
game as literally seconds after
the interval the otherwise flaw-
less GAAARRRRYYY’s hesitation
turned a seemingly innocuous long
ball into a pin point pass to leave
the GKT striker to roll the ball into
an empty net.
Game on. At this point the game
could really have got away from IC;
but luckily James “Long” ran onto
a “long” ball almost immediately af-
ter the GKT goal, and made no mis-
take to slot the ball past the keeper
with a quite “long” shot. After this
(metaphorical) hammer blow, GKT
began to lose their shape and disci-
pline and IC looked the most likely
scorers for the remainder of the
game.
A combination of Scott “The self-
proclaimed Animal” Mackenzie’s
incredible sliding challenge, “Citi-
zen Snipps” Ed Lobb’s amazing
goal line clearance and excellent
linesmanship from Sam “no nick-
name” Styles ensured that IC held
on for a famous 3-1 win.
An excellent display all round,
but special praise goes to the back
5; GAAARRRRYYY, Scott, Toby,
Snipps and Graham who coped
excellently with a quick and skilful
GKT side.
Imperial set up for another mouvement general attack against a bewildered opponent; the ref looks on, bemused and slightly off balance
