Emotions, TVs, and radios
More live reviews including the omni-present Feeder and TV on the Radio
The crowd at this TV on the Radio
show is quite unlike any I’ve ever
been to before. The people here
vary greatly in age; from impres-
sionably young indie kids, copy of
NME wedged in their back pocket,
to wise old veterans still reminisc-
ing about the glorious days of old
when music was interesting and
exciting for them. It seems every-
one can find something to love in
this band, and the diversity in age
and race present at the packed-out
Koko tonight is proof of that.
The band opens with the pacy
Dirtywhirl, which starts slowly
with gentle layers of guitars, before
being brought to life by the energet-
ic vocals of frontman Tunde Ade-
bimpe. His sincere and heartfelt
performance punctuates the oth-
erwise peaceful guitars and sleigh
bells which provide the rhythm.
Interestingly coiffured guitarist,
Kyp Malone, also joins in with some
unbelievably high-pitched back-up
vocals which perfectly complement
the lead.
I initially imagined the gig would
be a much more sombre affair than
it is, as many of their songs are
slow and down-tempo, but the band
throw everything into their per-

O
ne thing that is
really pissing me
off at the minute
is the amount of
little rat dogs there
are hanging around. I was in the
union the other week and saw
someone with what can only be
described as mutant spawn of
a drunk shag with a cotton ball
factory and a shivering amoeba.
It looked so pathetic, I wanted
to step on it and put it out of its
misery.
I know they’re everywhere in
this leafy crevice of London has
an obligatory mouse-puppy, but
come on, why would you put it
through the misery of taking it
for a walk? They’re so tiny and
inbred they can barely stand up
without wanting to chew their
already-removed private parts
off, just to numb the pain of their
existence. If you insist on getting
a dog, get a proper one. Get a dog
that is proud to take a dump on
the street whilst the owner awaits
eagerly with a plastic bag. Don’t
get a dog that every time it needs
to crap, it fears for its life.
Why am I going on about crappy
little dogs anyway? What’s it got
to do with music I hear you shout
whilst perming your poodle’s
arse-curls? Well, I compare
Feeder to one of these dogs.
Feeder insist on making more
music when – I’m sorry if I’m
being disrespectful – even their
drummer killed himself to get out
of this band.
If you listen to their past two al-
bums, all you will hear is a whim-
per. When the best thing you can
say about a band is that they are
‘anthemic’ and ‘emotional’, you
know you are scraping a barrel
so eroded that you can see Grant
Nicholas crying under said barrel
as the fallen splinters scratch his
eyes. The best thing they ever did
was shout the word lemon over
and over again. I assumed it was
a satire on the objectification of
lesbians in the music scene as
shouty riot-grrrrrrrl singers.
I could be proven wrong be-
cause I once drank cider from a
lesbian and had my tongue cut
on her numerous piercings. This
may not be a true story. Anyway, I
may not like Feeder, but some of
you do and you’re entitled to that
opinion, so we’ve got a review for
you. Also, Freddie Freeloader,
who are reviewed on the other
page are playing in dB’s on Satur-
day, go pop along if you want.
Colossal base lines; intense guitar
riffs; voluminous rhythms; thun-
dering lyrics. There is an emotion-
al underlining to the three-piece
that make them stand out from
the crowd, which was all the more
prominent during their perform-
ance at the Roundhouse, a gig in
aid of the charity War Child.
Initially starting off as a pure indie
band with rock at its heart, Feeder
suddenly took on a far more senti-
mental, moving and often emotive
approach to their music, culminat-
ing in Comfort In Sound, an album
clearly influenced by the suicide of
their original drummer, Jon Lee. In
every performance from that point
on, Feeder concentrated on mak-
ing their sound more personal, and
it could not have been more appro-
priate for this particular gig.
Come Back Around, a fairly en-
ergetic piece, proved to be a suit-
able opener to get the crowd going,
although with Feeder’s reputation
among the nation and the dedica-
tion of its fans, they simply needed
to walk onto the stage for the audi-
ence to be at their beck and call.
Interestingly enough, unlike most
bands around today, Feeder does
not have one lead personality, such
as Chris Martin of Coldplay or Gary
Lightbody of Snow Patrol. They
function as one unit, with the vocals
of Grant Nicholas, the pounding
bass of Taka Hirose and drum-work
of Mark Richardson all playing an
equal role, musically and visually.
This was clearly evident in the un-
deniably impassioned performance
of fan favourite, Feeling a Moment,
a soaring track with the lead guitar
riffs and effortless vocals propelling
the audience into a plethora of ex-
citable leaping and backing vocals.
Whilst Grant hammered gracefully
away at his guitar, he made way for
a very jumpy Taka – who both used
their guitar bridges as extra drum-
sticks for Mark – all merging into
one quite energetic stage perform-
ance as well as a musical triumph.
Another particularly poignant
track, Just The Way I’m Feeling,
saw Grant wield his acoustic gui-
tar to great effect, and the crowd
– with great gusto – was as moved
as the band members themselves,
judging by the huge grins on their
faces; it must have been a wonder-
ful sight to see hundreds of fans
waving their arms in unison to the
epic chorus.
This is not to say that Feeder
solely based their setlist on emo-
tional, moving tracks. Liberally
sprinkled throughout the hour-and-
a-half were the best in head-bang-
ing, mosh-pitting, sky-reaching in-
die rock.
Of course, Buck Rogers and Feed-
er go hand in hand, and the venue
positively exploded into joy when
the opening riff could be heard; this
piece of legendary indie culminated
in most of the crowd jumping to at
least the height of the stage during
what can only be described as the
three guitar-riff explosions at the
end of each verse.
Lost and Found again generated
similar energetic leaping, this time
with the bassist encouraging peo-
ple to be as volatile as possible by
mimicking their previous jumping
efforts on stage. Just a Day – pos-
sibly the track that generated most
of Feeder’s fans – produced what
was by far and away the most spec-
tacular display of jubilance I have
ever witnessed at a gig. The track
itself is a rapid, rhythm-heavy piece
with lyrics particularly relevant to
students (“Waking up at twelve in
my clothes again/feel my head ex-
plode from a night of gin/another
night out late”), and I was amazed
as complete strangers placed arms
over soldiers to form one massive
cascading wall of screaming fans.
From start to finish, Feeder pro-
duced both an emotive and ener-
getic sound unique in the overpopu-
lated indie circuit. A surprise cover
of REM’s Everybody Hurts dur-
ing the encore, sung with absolute
hand-on-heart honesty by Grant,
proved that no other band around
today could be more suited to not
only producing this kind of music,
but to support such an admirable
cause with their near-perfect art.

formance and even speed up some
songs with pounding drums to liven
the mood. At some points the crowd
really joins in with the feel of the
show; flailing arms into the air and
chanting the words to the anthemic
Let the Devil In. The fans clearly
feel a real connection with the band
in moments like these, and the
band are obviously enjoying every
minute too.
At other times, parts of the crowd
seem very detached and uninter-
ested, talking during songs and not
bothering to applaud the band for
their effort in-between. These ‘sce-
nesters’ seem more bothered with
being seen at the gig than actually
enjoying it, and in doing so, really
spoil the experience for others who
are trying to appreciate the beauty
of the music. The fact that Club
NME started right after the band
finished probably had something to
do with the general attitude of some
of the crowd, but the bar prices
made sure I didn’t stick around long
enough to see if they hung around.
Predictably the band return for
an encore where, unpredictably,
the drummer and guitarist swap
instruments and play out to the
euphoric Staring at the Sun which
is a fittingly intense conclusion to
a brilliantly performed show. The
sound quality of the venue and the
attitude of the crowd are the only
letdowns of a gig that I just didn’t
want to end. To remedy this prob-
lem I bought a T-shirt and listened
to the album on the bus home, but I
guess I’ll just have to wait until they
next play here to really satisfy my
craving for more.
