Sudan Tragedy
“The cause of Sudanese internal
conflict is generally attributed to
ethnic divisions and control over
vital natural resources as well
as the disparity in development
between ‘outer’ regions such as
Darfur and the wealthier ‘Blue Nile’
area.”

Lo-fi fashion
“A lot of the price tags will make
you choke, but you can find some
key fashion pieces here. So, if you
factor in the amount of wear you'll
get per pound, you can easily
justify the silly prices.”

Angry letters clues
“The most common obstacle to
solving crosswords is not knowing
the types of clue commonly used,
and finding them too complicated
as a result – in actual fact, there
are only a dozen or so frequently
used types of clue (or parts
thereof) that are needed to solve
most crosswords.”

IC rules the water
“Imperial dominated the compe-
tition, as well as being the first
university on the water. Notable
highlights included: a top 5 place
for Chris in the highly competitive
Freestyle, a 2nd and 3rd in the
advanced racing for Chris and Niall
and top 5 places in the intermedi-
ate fleet for Jahn and Jake - and
this was Jahns first SWA event!”

Chem Eng incident
The Fire Brigade was called to
South Kensington campus last
Thursday, when a barrel contain-
ing around five litres of chlorinated
waste chemicals began giving off
white fumes.
According to the Head of Depart-
ment for Chemical Engineering,
waste was being disposed of into
the barrel when a gas was released,
whichwasmainlyhydrochloricacid.
The Fire Brigade were called, and
within fifteen minutes a number of
appliances had arrived; eventually
there were more than 8 appliances
and a number of incident support
vehicles on site.
The cordoning off of the area
closed the Walkway, the rear of the
Sherfield Building, and the build-
ings around the Chemical Engi-
neering building. However, a lone
student was spotted striding pur-
posefully towards the site, before
being chastised by a security officer.
Decontamination showers were set
up, and a number of officers were
kitted out with hazmat suits.
Fire hydrants around the Chem
Eng building were found to be in-
active by the Brigade, who had to
bring water from the side of the
Sherfield building. This was due to
recent works to install a Combined
Heat and Power (CHP) unit nearby.
A number of students approached
this reporter with concerns over the
way the incident was handled, and
Felix put these questions to Ceri
Davis, Head of Security. No alarms
sounded in the building; Mr Davis
says that this is because the evacua-
tion needs to be controlled to direct
people away from the dangerous
area. Exiting through the nearest
exit could endanger students. The
slow evacuation of the building was
in response to the need to increase
the size of the cordon based on ad-
vice from officers on the scene. Mr
Davis added: “The management of
the incident from a Security point of
view went very well.”
Referendum results
The graph below shows voting
numbers versus time; the pink
line indicates yes votes, and the
blue line indicates no votes.
Initially, the no campaign were
leading by around 200 votes at
the end of the first day of voting.
At this point, emails had been
sent to all student eligable to
vote, reminding them to vote.
The sharp increase in numbers
voting on Tuesday afternoon
was likely due to the heavy
campaigning by both sides at
lunchtime on the walkway, in
the JCR, Dalby Court and other
common areas of campus, with
those canvassed returning to
computer rooms to vote.
On Wednesday, personalised
emails were sent to all those
who had not voted already, and
the Medic President reminded
his consituents to vote, resulting
in the huge spike in voting.
The yes campaign took
the lead just before 6pm on
Wednesday, and remained in
the lead by around 250 votes
until the close of voting. Percent-
age results were 53.3% for yes,
46.7% for no.
Students targeted for sex
acts in UCL campus toilets
UCL
’s new student newspaper, Pi
Squared, has uncovered a bizarre
story involving older men “cruis-
ing” the male toilets on the UCL
campus at Gower Street, looking
for sex with students.
Rumours that the toilets were
known as a regular spot for older
men to pick up younger male stu-
dents have been floating around the
campus for a number of months.
However, the team at Pi Squared
discovered posts on an Internet
forum, dating back as far as 2004,
stating that the toilets were a good
place to find “horny fresher types,”
and that there is “tons of action go-
ing on”. The site urges readers “to
be discreet so this place is kept!”
The reporters even managed to
locate one man, known as “Steve”,
who had apparently been cruising
the facilities after finishing work.
Students have complained of men
attempting to climb into their toilet
cubicles, with the same student be-
ing targeted twice this year.
“Cruising” describes the act of
searching a public place in order to
find a sex partner.
