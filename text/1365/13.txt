T
his week, I have been
recovering from a ter-
rible blow to my televi-
sion viewing schedule:
the sorry demise of
the Quiz Call channel. And what
has the gaping hole in my life
known as Freeview channel 31
(on my box, at leasat) been filled
with? The crime against schedul-
ing that is Film4+1. Whoever in-
vented video recorders is turning
in his grave as all these needless
‘+1’ channels jump up and down
on his coffin. Honestly, what is the
point? The invention of watches
predates even that of the VCR,
so surely there’s nothing wrong
with our timekeeping abilities,
so why do channel 4 patronise us
so? At least on E4+1 most of the
programmes clock in at under an
hour, so the dedicated viewer can
see the same show twice, back to
back, but on Film4+1 we must be
content with watching a film just
one and a half times, or worse!
When will this madness end.
Getting back onto things a little
more nightlife-related, I urge all of
you to let your eyes stray a little
further down the page and read
the Our Disco preview we have
furnished you with this week and
then put on your dancing shoes
and go! (Of course, you should
read everything else on the page
too). It’s no secret that Our Disco
has long been one of our favourite
clubnights here at Nightlife and
we are delighted to see it back
again.

UK hip hop scene hits Scala
Some of the country’s top hip hop acts celebrate Foreign Beggars’ album launch
Arriving at The Scala in London’s
Kings Cross to see one of the UK’s
largest underground hip-hop acts,
you could be forgiven for asking
yourself if you were going to get
shot tonight. The bouncers seemed
to understand this and were oper-
ating on similar levels of paranoia
to West Bank checkpoint operators
and one gained a rather more famil-
iar experience of my anatomy than I
usually allow so soon after meeting.
Inside, however, I was pleasantly
reminded that this was abetter va-
riety of UK hip-hop, where being
straight out of Camden, or having
hoes in different area codes doesn’t
take centre stage, so a refreshing
atmosphere provided a close to
flawless night.
Impeccable timing meant our ar-
rival fortunately coincided with the
beginning of Shlomo’s set. It is often
suggested that he now represents
Britain’s most gifted beatboxer and
the set was certainly amongst the
best I’ve seen. While it can’t be de-
nied that a large part of the effect
is down to technical skill, style and
musical dexterity has to be taken
into account. Shlomo’s set demon-
strated this point excellently and
he certainly put himself strongly in
the arena with other heavyweights
such as Killa Kela and Mr. Mouth.
Using a loop sampler, a signifi-
cant proportion of his set involved
putting together a track layer by
layer, then finally adding the vocals
(of these, the most memorable in-
cluded ‘I Want You Back’ by Jack-
son Five and ‘The Magic Number’
by De La Soul).
All too soon Shlomo was ush-
ered off the stage, giving me the
chance to explore this impressive,
converted cinema a little more.
An intermission to the Pontius Pi-
late reinforced my impression of
an ethereal atmosphere, after ex-
changing pleasantries instead of
dirty looks when passing through
the crowd, to find people freestyl-
ing by the cubicles that ‘some don’t
understand them’ (“that was some
deep shit” apparently).
One floor up, room 2 was being set
up for the open-mic cypher that was
being held at this night of so many
attractions. This kicked off after
the main show and was hosted by
Honey Brown, with beats supplied
by DJ Snuff. Speaker’s Corner reg-
ulars Rhyme Asylum, The Rippah
and Kope among others, with more
established artists on the UK hip
hop scene, such as Kashmere, gave
the mic the blessing it had been an-
ticipating. Speaker’s Corner excels
at what they do and pulled through
troubles with sound to provide en-
tertainment and a platform of free
speech for anybody with the co-
jones to step up on stage.
After an efficiently short break
the beggars emerged on stage.
First (and unashamedly) Orifice
was rapidly on the stage making
sure none of the hype from the
previous performance died down.
In succession appeared Metropo-
lis and Doctor Syntax, with a full
live band, backing vocals and va-
riety of top British DJs, including
IQ and Vadim, to bring the night
to a climax. They immediately
launched into a varied yet consist-
ently great set, including many
classics from Asylum Speakers and
tracks from their brand new album
(which looks to be a sure success).
They had clearly done their home-
work before this performance and
truly entertained and engaged the
crowd. Orifice’s banter continued
throughout the set, about moving
to London (in 1999) and his grow-
ing love for his home city. Perhaps
this was a heart felt expression for
a city he has come to love and feel
Competition: Showtime at Egg
at home in, or merely an attempt to
win over the Scala crowd. Either
way, it would appear as though the
audience needed little winning over
as Foreign Beggars were hugely
applauded as they left the stage.
Closing the night were Scratch
Perverts, an institution in UK
DJing to say the least. Many, I had
thought, may have been present
that night to see Scratch Perverts
alone. However, as they walked on
stage I was one of possibly only a
dozen spectators to welcome them.
Somehow, the main room had gone
from being nearly full to embar-
rassingly empty. To make matters
worse, as the two DJs worked their
way through “Terrorist”, “Witness”
and many other hip hop classics, the
audience seemed to disintegrate
more and more. Nevertheless the
duo continued long into the morn-
ing not letting this lack of audience
affect their routine as they contin-
ued with great skill and vigour.
All in all the night turned out to be
a fantastic offering of music; UK hip
hop ability at its finest! However, it
is still disappointing to see UK acts
as big as Foreign Beggars playing
Scala on a Wednesday night, and it
gives a little hope for the prospects
of other UK acts just as able but less
established outside of their genre.
My only regret for the evening is
missing Kashmere, but I guess you
can’t have it all, so I decided to con-
sole myself with some ‘top notch’
pizza prepared over the road.
Suddenly curious as to the func-
tion of a particular lever on my
camera which I had used countless
times, I almost saw in slow motion
the rear door bounce open to bring
the sensitive into the harsh and un-
forgiving light of the environment.
Quick to react however, my fears of
a ruined roll of film, and the tedium
of now having to track down pho-
tos of the night, replaced by relief
once development was finished. In
fact, I was quite pleased with the
one photo that was sodomised by
the event. My precious silver-halide
crystals were clearly in no mood for
being tampered with, and left me
with what I think is a fitting image
to summarise the evening.

I have absolutely no idea what is happening in this picture
On Saturday 2nd December, ‘Show-
time presents...’ is back to cel-
ebrate the holiday season in true
festive style with a very special and
exclusive pantomime performance
from Jonny Woo and his friends
performed to a backdrop of Lon-
don’s finest cutting edge house and
electro music.
The newest addition to Saturday
nights at Egg incorporates live
music, cabaret, VJs and a host of
internationally talented DJs. These
themed fancy dress parties ensure
that each event is very unique.
This time, the basement will see
Mary Jane playing ‘the freaky mini-
mal style that is typical for elec-
tronic music in Berlin’ alongside
homegrown talent including Lisa
German, Sophie Oliver and Claudia
Lovista. The terrace will be hosted
by Shack Music head Soy Mustafa
in the form of a release party for
Liquid People’s new record “Song
of the Siren” with Liquid People
playing live. Finally, in the loft, Alex
Phountzi and Daz-I-Kue (Bugz in
the Attic) hit the decks with an elc-
lectic mix of sounds played around
Hopefully it won’t be too cold this December; I have high hopes
the exciting performance from Jon-
ny Woo and friends.
In addition to all this, the Union
Jakx film taken at the last ‘Show-
time presents...’ event will be
premiered.
‘Showtime presents...’ takes place
on Saturday 2nd December at Egg
in Kings Cross from 10pm to 6am
and will set you back £15 on the
door, or £12 for concessions.
If this sounds good to you, but
you don’t fancy paying, then send
us a quick email to the address at
the top of the page telling us you’d
like to go and we will give away a
few pairs of free tickets, including
free entry to the Jaded afterparty,
which runs until 1pm to ensure you
get your fill of entertainment.
The Our Disco DJs, outside
Hooray, And Did We Mention Our
Disco has finally found a new home!
Sub Club near Liverpool Street Sta-
tion will host the club night from
now on. The venue has apparently
recently been renovated, boasts
sensible drinks prices (unlike Can-
vas) and has an extremely loud
soundsystem! You’ll be able to hear
a delightful selection of (as they de-
scribe it) “post-punk, glitch-funk,
schitzo-electro and mutant disco”
If you don’t know what those words
mean, they are basically synonyms
for Super Duper Fun. You should
therefore most certainly go and
check out the opening night on the
1st of December, not only because
it’s the first Our Disco in ages, but
also because the lineup is pretty
damn good too.
The usual residents Glyn Camp-
bell, Den Odell and Nadia Ksaiba
will be joined by the amazing Op-
timo DJ JD Twitch from Glasgow
and the mighty Simian Mobile Dis-
co who, if you read our review on
Adventures In The Beetroot Field,
you will know are rather talented
at DJing. You’ll also have read how
good the Our Disco guys were at
Fabric recently, which must have
been one of their last tour dates be-
fore starting the new residency, and
if it’s anything as good as that night
was, we’re in for a treat.
If you’re planning on going, we
suggest you get there early; it may
be popular so they might fill up
pretty quickly, and judging by the
past few events they’ve had, it prob-
ably will do. Check out the website
www.ourdisco.com for more info
and, most of all, enjoy the night!
Our Disco is back!
