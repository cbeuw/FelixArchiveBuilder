It may come as a surprise to most
but on previous albums Diddy didn’t
seem to mind sharing the limelight
with his collaborators. His previ-
ous two releases, We Invented The
Remix Vol. 1 and The Saga Contin-
ues… were both co-credited to ‘The
Bad Boy Family’, which was only
fair considering the amount they
contributed to them.
So when his latest offering was
strictly credited to ‘Diddy’, you’d
expect it to be a one-man show
starring the self-proclaimed king of
New York, but you’d be wrong.
In fact, Press Play features over 20
different guest appearances (which
must be some kind of record) and
that doesn’t include the big-name
producers who have left marks all
over the record. From the likes of
Christina Aguilera and lead Pus-
sycat Doll, Nicole, to edgier artists
like Nas and Mary J. Blige. It’s an
orgy and everyone’s invited to help
resurrect Diddy’s fading rap career
and record label.
The first song off this album,
Come to Me, really wasn’t a true
representation of the album. It was
pretty weak for a lead single and
gave the impression that Press
Play might not live up to the hype
surrounding it. Fortunately, Come
To Me was a fluke and the record
has enough bubble-gum rap to keep
mainstream listeners happy. A
good example is the potent Tell Me,
featuring Christina Aguilera which
is set to be the next single off the al-
bum, and it is bound to be huge.
The first few tracks, We Gon’ Make
It, I Am, The Future, are devoted to
Diddy’s ego, telling us how he's not
going anywhere and declaring him-
self the king of New York. He also
makes a threat of running for Presi-
dent. These brags and boasts are a
standard feature of any contempo-
rary rap album but great rap artists
know to keep it smart and keep it to
a minimum. Unfortunately, Diddy
isn’t a great rapper and this inevi-
tably takes over and becomes the
theme for a sizeable chunk of the
album.
When he does take time out from
kissing his own rear and tries to
tackle other rap staples – mainly
hooking up and breaking up – he is a
bit more interesting and it becomes
evident that his rhyming skills have
improved. However, it is a problem
that he is still not as proficient as he
thinks he is.
The best songs are the ones where
Diddy's run-of-the-mill rap verses
are broken up by catchy choruses
by a guest vocalist or delivered over
infectious beats. In a nutshell, it is
never because of Diddy's skills as
an MC but more because he has tal-
ented friends.
So will he have you itching to
Press Play? Well, honestly, yes, he

Scott Walker has had a quite re-
markable career. In the mid-60's,
he was lead singer of The Walker
Brothers, a hugely successful vocal
pop group. At the height of fame,
he left them to pursue a solo ca-
reer singing Jacques Brel-inspired
chansons. The 70s saw the increas-
ingly reclusive artist slowly fade
into obscurity. His last ever tour
was in 1978 and his 1984 album, Cli-
mate of Hunter became the biggest
commercial failure in the history
of Virgin Records. After that, there
was silence. For 11 years.
Then came Tilt. An unasham-
edly difficult album that was un-
like anything before it. Tilt was
dark and stripped down; a barren
monolith constructed of monoto-
nous rhythms, sweeping orchestral
textures, weird sound experiments
and operatic vocals. Needless to
say, it didn't even make it close to
the mainstream. However, it be-
came an instant classic with the
more open-minded (Goldfrapp,
Brian Eno and David Bowie among
others, have praised it highly). It
may not come as a surprise that it's
taken Walker another 11 years to
produce a follow-up, with everyone
wondering how he could possibly
outdo himself.
As it turns out, it's actually quite
simple; by taking things even fur-
ther. While Tilt had its occasional
rays of sunshine, The Drift offers
only undiluted fear, pain and de-
spair. There are no more melodies
and no more grand arrangements,
only ominous, brooding sound-
scapes alternating with brutal out-
bursts of pure dissonance. And, of
course, some of the most bizarre
noises ever integrated into music; a
slab of meat being punched, some-
one walking up the stairs, a tortured
donkey, a Donald Duck imitation
and lots of unidentifiable chirping,
hissing and rattling.
On top of all this looms Walker's
baritone, reciting surreal lyrics
about such cheerful topics as Mus-
solini's execution, Elvis Presley's
stillborn brother, 9/11, famine and
the war in Bosnia. The result is per-
haps the most nightmarish, most
intensely unsettling record I've
ever heard – and I've heard a lot of
sick stuff.
I'm not sure I can give you an
accurate impression of The Drift,
simply because there is nothing
like it out there. It's perhaps closer
to the work of modern composers
like Schönberg than to anything in
the popular music world.
The majority of you would abso-
lutely hate it. But if you have an
adventurous mind and you'd like to
hear some of the most unique and
brilliant music being made today, I
urge you to give The Drift a try.

With the best band name I have
heard for a long time, I was expect-
ing much from Shiny Toy Guns.
I was not disappointed! Le Disko
starts off with ethereal swirling key-
boards, before the pounding synths
that drive the record forward kick
in. The seductive angst filled vo-
cals of 19-year-old lead singer, Ca-
rah Faye complements the driving
rhythm brilliantly, and works well
with the backing vocals of bassist
Chad Petree. Then, at the bridge
the whole song changes, from a
claustrophobic electronic blast to
sounding like Abba being fronted by
Bjork! The song as a whole is filled
with hundreds of electronic effects,
but unlike lesser bands, the music
never loses its clarity and sense of
progression.
The b-side, Starts With One fol-
lows the same electro-rock sensi-
bilities, but the two singers swap
duties, injecting a little more vari-
ety into proceedings.
Shiny Toy Guns are already start-
ing to make a name for themselves,
having the most requested song on
the influential KROQ Los Angeles,
before even being signed. The band
put their snowballing popularity
down to the internet, saying, “Ze-
roes and ones are a nuclear weapon
for a band.” If Shiny Toy Guns can
keep up the good work, and per-
haps expand their sound a little into
new areas, then they really will be a
creative force to be reckoned with
in the future.

Already Over
(Mercury)
★★✩✩✩
single review
Signed by Mercury Records in No-
vember of 2005, Orson closed the
year as support on the UK leg of the
Duran Duran arena tour and were
still largely an unknown band but
that has changed since the turn of
the year.
Before they released their debut
single, No Tomorrow, the band had
already graced the cover of The
Sunday Times Culture supplement,
made their debut performance on
Top of the Pops and been playlisted
by every station in the land from
Radio1 to Xfm. Quite a bit of expo-
sure by all accounts.
On release, No Tomorrow en-
tered the chart at number five, but
within two weeks had risen like an
old-fashioned hit record to take its
place at the top of the charts. In
fact, it was still in the top five seven
weeks after release. Unfortunately,
I doubt if their latest single, Already
Over, would have the same inpact.
This tracks sounds like album fill-
er and doesn’t show the uniqueness
No Tomorrow brought to our ster-
eos. We can hope for the best from
the Orson and this isn’t it.

single review
Gnarls Barkley, an Atlanta collabo-
ration between Maryland-based DJ
and producer Danger Mouse (Bri-
an Burton) and rapper/singer Cee-
Lo (Thomas Callaway). Their first
album, St. Elsewhere, was released
by Warner Music in April 2006 in
the UK. They stormed the UK with
the amazing single, Crazy. Now
the creative duo have a new single
called Who Cares, which is pure
genius. With skilful Cee-Lo drop-
ping some imaginative and ambi-
tious vocals on this track. Although
this single has a very summery vibe
to it and might not have the great
success of Crazy, it is definitely a
Gnarls Barkley signature single in
its own right.

This is Powergrunge
(Self-release)
★★★✩✩
EP review
This band coined their style early
on as ‘powergrunge’ (a combination
of grunge, funk, groove and metal).
Powergrunge harkens back to early
funksters such as the Red Hot Chili
Peppers and Faith No More, with
the addition of much heavier metal
guitar riffs on the top, whilst the
singer’s elegantly sung vocals help
steer the band away from nu-met-
al. There is great potential for this
band. Let’s hope they fulfil it.
