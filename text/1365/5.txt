W
e were greeted
by a duo of mid-
dle-aged leftist
Canadian les-
bians, who took
our money whilst looking lovingly
at one another and then promptly
showed us to our dormitory which
contained a veritable confederacy
of non-compos. In hostels, there
exists an almost cultish belief that
this is the only way to travel. This is
delusion on a grand scale, the con-
stant elephant in the room being
the fact that hostels are basically
countryside hideouts for bearded
sex-pests and socialists: two of the
most hideous fringe groups our
society has to offer. Quite frankly,
sharing bunk-beds with strangers
ceases to be appropriate some time
between getting your bike’s stabi-
lizers removed and the dropping of
one’s testicles.
This is not outrage at having to
slum it, I assure you; I have stayed
in some alarming holes in my time (I
live in one now, in fact). Spectacular
monstrosities of cockroach-mottled
bathroom floors and flea-crusted
beds with gruesome stains of blood
or vomit as a bedside companion.
But at least they had locks, and
there wasn’t a blimp called Kevin
sleeping above me who lists his
hobbies as walking, ales, and strok-
ing cadavers. A lock frees the mind
from worries normally reserved for
showering convicts, and will forever
be my only necessity when on coun-
try jaunts. ‘Settled in’, we attacked
the pub with aplomb, returning
seconds before the hostel’s curfew
– covered head to foot in stings re-
sulting form an ill-advised, alcohol
kindled leap over a wall into a well-
cultivated patch of angry nettles.
Day one: success!
The next day we wake early to the
sight of a bulging, bearded galoot
wearing only loose pants. Dressing
hastily with eyes averted we stoi-
cally shake off hangovers and stride
out onto the hills.
My word, are these ever hills.
These are merely hills, as the Eiffel
Tower is merely a jazzed up elec-
tricity pylon. The Quantocks are an
expanse of undulating land as far as
the eye can behold, you wander over
verdurous land with sinuous sea as
a navy backdrop. We were wander-
ing adventurers from ages past, but
instead of hunting for food to sup-
port clans, we were hunting for the
pub over the hills. Dressed in jeans
and t-shirts, we spectacularly blew
apart the dogmas of the GoreTex
brigade: loners with an outward-
bound store upon their back and a
scowl on their face. They walk up
and up, grinding towards their goal
then reach the top, mark a tick in a
leather notepad, and walk straight
back down to the nearest festering
hostel. To hell with them. We were
innovators; we climbed the Quan-
tocks highest peak and feasted on
slightly rotten chicken and Chianti
of an unknown age.
Yes, we stumbled through a deer
sanctuary in a haze; yes, we prac-
tised Karate Kid moves on a fallen
tree in a wood; but we conquered
those hills like no GoreTex-mon-
key ever will, and after five hours
in a pub we found ourselves in pitch
darkness: back on our conquered
hills, lost and very afraid.
Somehow we had wandered off
into marshland and were now knee-
deep in sludge. We were inebriated
and, owing to fear, had worsened
the situation by topping up our
levels with the emergency whis-
key. Fear had claimed me. I heard
distant mammalian noises: ‘Iain,
are those wolves?’ I asked, ‘Shit.
Wolves.’ It took us an age to figure
out that they were just geese. Sadly,
we were still lost on a Quantock.
Escaping the marshland, we came
upon a wire fence at the foot of the
slope. We had to try. Just making it
over, I looked over my shoulder just
in time to see Big Iain come close
but fall at the last, jagged hurdle.
If you have never seen a 6’ 7” man
skewered on a barbed wire fence,
I can assure you it is a sight to
behold.
Like an abandoned marionette
flung haphazardly on the floor,
strings knotted and tangled, Iain
was attached at the arm. “I’m
stuck,” he said morosely. I laughed;
he swore. For seemingly an age he
struggles; finally looking up, with a
look of terminal despondency, say-
ing: “just go on without me.” I re-
membered all the Vietnam films I’d
ever seen. When you’re in the suck
soldier, you never leave a man be-
hind! We heave and twist, scream
at each other until finally he is free
and over the barbed obstacle. We
scramble up the slick, muddy slope,
and at the top strain our eyes in
the moonlight examining the deep
blue rivulets trickling down Iain’s
arm. The relief is palpable and, a
few hundred feet along the path, we
see the landing strip of life beneath
us signifying our village, and (more
importantly) the pub. Quantocks
conquered again.
T
he next morning we
wake, and beard and
pants man tell us the
socialist Canadians are
after us. Perhaps we
stormed in post-libations, and tore
the hostel apart – waking every-
one and causing much distress. We
pack and escape through the back
door. The best way to escape an en-
raged crocodile is to run in zigzags.
Their turning circle and lumbering
mass are such that the scaled mon-
ster cannot work with either the zig
or the zag for sustained periods of
time. Socialist-Lesbian-Canadians,
however, are not flummoxed by the
zigzag, or indeed sprints through
dense woodland. They are an angry
bunch, a hardy predator, and a wor-
thy foe to the city-dweller seeking
nourishment from the verdant teat
of Somerset.
The above chase is a fabrication,
I admit. The lesbian-Canadians
merely wanted to pleasantly thank
us for purchasing them milk the
previous night. It was the country-
side that made me re-arrange the
truth: it enervates the spirit and
demands the elevation of the mun-
dane to the intrepid. The ladies
quizzing me on my socialist virtues
(lost in a near-fatal collision with re-
ality in 1999) was not enough. The
Quantocks had caused my heart to
demand the chase!
Somerset is London’s antithesis
and its spiritual nemesis. Som-
erset is the Arcadian Albion that
Coleridge and Wordsworth cooed
over – “So will I build my altar in
the fields / And the blue sky my
fretted dome shall be.” Beauteous,
rolling England distilled perfectly.
London is Dante’s first circle of hell
– metropolitan nightmare, chaotic
and lung-chokingly smoggy, but es-
sential and somehow we think it’s
absolutely wonderful, just a little
bit better than the rest of Lucifer’s
domain.
So for goodness sake go and enjoy
the nation fate has bestowed upon
us. Forget middle-class wet dreams
of Tuscany and the Algarve. The
Quantocks can change us all. But
before departing, be sure to learn
the words to ‘Jerusalem’, or your
trip will be entirely pointless.
