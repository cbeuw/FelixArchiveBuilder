Lack of backs causes IC 3rds a lot of pain
After last week’s hard victory, the
IC 3rds arrived at Fortress Harling-
ton, fired up for another battle.
IC’s kicker Antoine got the game
going with a good boot into the Sus-
sex half, where IC managed to keep
the ball in Sussex territory for the
first 20 minutes of the game. But,
after this almost promising start,
the IC’s play started to go down
hill. Sussex shipped the ball out to
a strong runner in their back line
who, after a couple of missed tack-
les, managed to touch the ball down
for his team. Following this, things
became pretty dark; the home
team making more mistakes than
a dyslexic trying to copy out the
dictionary.
IC seemed to be giving away
pointless penalties every minute, to
the extent that captain Ben Thomp-
son a.k.a. Pork Chop Loin (PCL)
received a mini bollocking from the
referee for it. Despite this, IC man-
aged only to concede one more try
before half time, which the Sussex
kicker failed to convert despite it
being taken from a position where
even the average prop forward
could have made it.
The team knew there was an al-
mighty half-time bollocking on the

cards; Coach Dave did not fail to de-
liver. Apparently it was like watch-
ing fifteen “raving homosexuals”,
finishing up saying the 3rds needed
to “fuck off back out there and grow
a pair.”
The words of wisdom seemed to
work; after an almighty charge from
Imperial and some very sexy ruck-
ing, captain PCL dived over the line
for our first try, which was cleanly
converted. This lifted spirits and
heads were held very high as IC re-
turned to their half. Unfortunately
Sussex got a very lucky bounce
from the kick and managed to touch
it down under the posts within two
minutes of the restart.
The game slowed down a notch
amd IC began to dominate up front,
the wheeling of the scrum that had
happened last game (mainly thanks
to monster prop ‘Satcho Relaxo’)
and during the first half had turned
into a full on drive over the ball,
which produced many turnovers.
IC’s domination was confirmed fol-
lowing a line out mid-way through
the half. A clean take from Nicolas
jumping at four then, as directed by
Penfold, the forward bound round
and drove the maul just under half
way up the pitch. Upon reaching
the line the ball went through Pen-
fold to our flamboyant Frenchy An-
toine who dived in low for a try in
the corner. Unfortunately IC failed
to convert.
The remainder of the match was
very close fought, both subsequent
Sussex tries were runs by the
backs, around the wings; where
they managed to break tackles and
get through.
Soon after the second of these, IC
were rewarded with another seven
points, scored due to a hard tackle-
breaking run by Charlie, something
that he, along with fellow forward
turned centre Sam, had been ex-
ecuting all game.
This left IC, in the final ten min-
utes, with only a three point deficit.
Both teams seemed to wake up to
the fact that this match was still an-
ybody’s, and the intensity raised ac-
cordingly. We seemed to be pushing
up to their line slowly; unfortunate-
ly, after a turnover, a Sussex boot
sent the ball back into our territory.
The defence of this kick was a
little scrappy and a stupid penalty
was awarded in front of the posts
for use of hands in the ruck. This
did not dampen IC spirit; the re-
start saw some super rolling for-
ward play; helped along with good
strength from PCL and our Brown
Bullet Satcho.
In the last few phases of play, PCL
secured himself twat of the match
with a dive over the line from the
back of the scrum to put the ball
down. Unfortunately, in the heat of
the moment, he confused the five
metre with the try line causing Sus-
sex, along with everyone else, much
amusement.
Through the final minutes, we
kept on fighting in vain with the
game ending with Sussex kicking
the ball out of play.
The mood was extremely sombre
in the après match huddle, with
more words from Coach Dave, leav-
ing us with a lot of sorrows to drown
at the Palais later that evening.

Autumn has to be my favorite time
of year; the leaves turning, conker
competitions and, of course, it’s of-
ten very windy! Because of the fan-
tastic conditions this is a hectic time
for the windsurf club with weekly
events taking us all over the coun-
try: Cornwall, Cardiff, Poole and
Nottingham all in the last month,
with Cambridge this weekend and
Exeter coming hot on its heels.
Having focused on the beginners
at the awesome Aussie Kiss festival
in Cornwall (all 700 of them) it was
the turn of the advanced sailors
to show their skills at the Cardiff
wave event over the bonfire night
weekend.
Unfortunately the wave series
didn’t start with the eagerly an-
ticipated bang as the wind decided
not to blow. Instead we got a final
glimpse of summer in November;
many thanks to global warming!*
Donning out favorite board shorts
for probably the final time this year
Imperial dominated the sun filled
weekend. Highlights included an
Imperial one-two, from Chris and
Alex, in the land-boarding speed
challenge, team victories in the
beach volleyball and ultimate Fris-
bee competitions, then wowing
the crowds and drinking de Apfle
Fizz as mock rock band Full Power
played at the eurotrash-themed
party. Honoury Imperialite Lidl
Miss Lucy won best costume (a sur-
prisingly classy affair made entirely
of Lidl Bags).
A special mention must go to
Chris who somehow forward
looped a mountain board, attached
to windsurf sail, on a flat beach with
very little wind to aid take-off.

onstrated our engineering prowess
by running away with the sand cas-

Wales, building not only the Pyra-

you fancy getting a bit closer to the
real thing, as well as some sunshine

Following the success of the Car-
diff weekend the whole club were
reunited for the first Student Wind-
surf Association (SWA) core event
of the season. SWA events are de-
signed to let windsurfers of all lev-
els meet up, windsurf, then party
the night away which is exactly
what we did in Nottingham (and
this time it was windy)!
With a solid force 5 blowing and a
good sized chop ripping across the
reservoir, the windsurfers threw
themselves out there with passion;
what better way is there to clear
your head in the morning?
Again Imperial dominated com-
petition, as well as being the first
university on the water. Notable
high-lights included: a top 5 place
for Chris in a highly competitive
Freestyle competition, a 2nd and
3rd in the advanced racing for
Chris and Niall and top 5 places in
the intermediate fleet for Jahn and
Jake - and this was Jahns first SWA
event!

the Union for its support, allowing
the purchase of high quality equip-
ment which allows us to compete
at the top levels where we couldn’t
in the past; long may it continue.

and many old hands happy to throw
