Following a week of repeats, this
week brings a brand new cross-
word with entirely new clues.
The week before last, however,
only one person sent in a solution.
This was a little disappointing, as
I know for a fact that at least three
people completed it. Please send in
your solutions - you can win actual
hard cash for your troubles.
Given last fortnight’s odds, you
would be certain to win ten whole
pounds if you send it in. Given the
level of response last time, you
wouldn’t even have needed to get a
single clue right.
You literally can’t get better odds
than those.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
Look, we in Felix have
had a hard week. I
know it looks like the
newspaper just ap-
pears every Friday to
sate your need for bi-
zarre writings, but it actually takes
us hours and hours to do. So while
you’re getting loveless sex from
strangers, we’re in the office.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
This week, you’ll feel
a strange compulsion
to smear your back
in peanut butter and
sled down nearby
concrete ramps. After
eighteen hours in A&E, the junior
doctor on call finally removes all
the glass from your spine. You fall
in love with him or something.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
You are a disgusting
sadist. You have a
sexually transmitted
disease (say, genital
warts) and spread it to
as many people as you
can in order to inflict the maxi-
mum amount of pain on the largest
number of people. Get to a GUM
clinic or I’ll hurt you.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
Huge gaping wounds
appear in your face.
Hahahaha. You look
ugly. Double haha-
haha. Also, you smell
of vinegar constantly
because you work in a Walkers fac-
tory. Well, not vinegar, but vinegar
flavouring. Triple hahahaha. I’ve
got nothing here, people.
This Week’s Horoscopes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
Jesus is also God ap-
parently. I thought I
met Him once, I found
Him under Battersea
Bridge nibbling at the
corners of a twiglets
packet for sustenance. He told me
his name was Fernando and that
there was a job for me as a waiter
in his gingerbread house. He lied.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
You think noone is
watching when you
migrate your hand to
warmer climates to
measure the humidity.
You are wrong! Jesus
is watching you, and He’s loving
every minute. To spite you He
gives you the stigmata. No more
rub-fun for you!
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
The problem with you
is that you don’t listen.
I tell you things here
every week, and you
don’t do them. How
the hell am I supposed
to write news if none of you go out
and get raped by a labrador or set
fire to a school? I think it’s just self-
ish, and I quit. Screw you all.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
You like immature
humour, don’t you? Of
course you do, or you
wouldn’t be reading
the horoscope. Well,
this week’s crossword
has a lot of immature jokes in it. Go
on, take a look.
Have a go at it. You know you fuck-
ing love it.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
You’ve completed all
your problem sheets.
Feeling studious you
take a walk through
the park, kicking the
leaves. You then real-
ise every situation that happened
in your problems is happening to
you. Bad news my friend, part 7a
wasn’t 23.4 eV. You’re going down.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
Oh, you lot think
you’re so fucking
funny, don’t you? Well,
“Felix Horoscope”
is a euphamism for
“syphillitic inflama-
tion”. You filthy bag of plague-rid-
den fuckwits. Keep away from me,
I don’t want to catch anything. (Too
late - Felix Horoscope Squad)
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
You get mistaken for
Keanu Reeves in a bar
one night. Laughing
off the comparison,
you go home and
sleep. You then are
unsure if you’re asleep or awake.
A black guy in leather turns up at
your door. It’s Bruno and you still
haven’t footed the bill.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
Do you like money,
naked ladies and
drinking Kristal? Well
this week you appear
in a hip hop video
featuring all of these.
Then you get told at the end to foot
the bill or the very large Bruno will
play jazz with your organs. The bad
news is that he hates music.

As promised two weeks ago,
though delayed a week due to
a lack of consideration on the
part of a sub-editor, and due to
popular demand, this is the first
in a hopefully regular series of
columns that will hopefully al-
low more people to solve the Felix
crossword and, less importantly,
cryptic crosswords in general.
The most common obstacle to
solving crosswords is not knowing
the types of clue commonly used,
and finding them too complicated
as a result – in actual fact, there
are only a dozen or so frequently
used types of clue (or parts there-
of) that are needed to solve most
crosswords. Before going any
further, it is important to recog-
nise that a cryptic clue will almost
invariably mean something very
different on the surface to the an-
swer it is driving you towards, and
most punctuation is thrown in to
further obscure the true meaning.
For instance, “Brutally slain with
talons (5)” does not refer to any
sort of violent act. Instead, it leads
to the answer “nails” for reasons
that will be described below.
Clues almost invariably consist
of two parts – a definition of the
answer and some form of word-
play. Crucially, these can occur
in either order, and the setter of
the crossword will do their best
to make it difficult to tell which is
the definition – in the example
above, the definition could be
“brutally”, “talons” or perhaps
“brutally slain”. In this instance,
it is “talons”, while “brutally
slain” indicates that it is an ana-
gram of “slain”, since any word
or phrase which imply disor-
der – along the lines of “bru-
tally”, “confused”, “disfigured”,
“mixed”, “disperse”, etc. – can
be used to indicate that an ana-
gram is to be taken.
Anagram-based clues are per-
haps the most infamous, though
amongst the easiest to begin
with, but far more common are
those that contain a number of
smaller words pieced together
to form the answer. For instance,
“I go around truncated low ice
house (5)” means the letters
“Igo” around “lo”. (Since “trun-
cated low” indicates that “low”
is to be truncated – this almost
invariably means to do so by
one letter. Other words used to
mean this can be “endless”, “un-
finished” or “headless” to mean
the first letter is to be removed.)
This gives the answer “Igloo”,
the ice house referred to in the
clue. While this may sound far
too complicated, this sort of clue
becomes easy with practice.
Common pieces of such clues
include numbers, which will
generally indicate their roman
numeral counterparts; “point”,
which indicates n, s, e, w or any
other points of the compass;
“king” indicating r or k; “way”
indicating st or rd; elements
indicating their abbreviations
from the periodic table; transla-
tions of simple words – le or la
indicated by “the french”, for
instance; “that is” indicating ie;
“for example” indicating eg; and
any other common abbrevia-
tions may be used.

Last week’s crossword
There was a massive mix-up in the
Felix basement last week, as the
sharp readers amongst you may
have noticed. We (and by we, I mean
me, Andy) managed to upload the
wrong page to our printers.
We are truly sorry, and will spend
this evening whipping ourselves
with birch twigs in penance for this
hideous mistake.
