Next generation gaming has begun
Tomo Roberts gives his verdict on whether you should go for a Wii this Christmas or hold out for a PS3
W
ith the immi-
nent release of
the Nintendo Wii
worldwide and
the third incarna-
tion of the Sony PlayStation already
available in Japan and the USA, the
companies’marketingdepartments
are working overtime to create the
loudest buzz about their respective
consoles.
On Monday 13th November, I was
lucky enough to be given the chance
to put both consoles through the
paces. The opportunity arose when
Radio 1’s technology reporter Iain
Mackenzie posted on a message
board I regularly view, requesting
a number of gamers to come along
and try out the two next-gen ma-
chines. The catch? Unfortunately,
masses of listeners had to be sub-
jected to my not-so-dulcet tones
as my analysis soared out over the
airwaves.
I was giddy with excitement; part-
ly because I felt like a member of an
exclusive ‘I’ve played the Wii and
PS3, who wants to touch me?’ club,
but mainly because both consoles
are ones that I can’t wait to get my
grubby mitts on. So far, I’ve held out
from buying an Xbox 360. I’ve come
close at times with the allure of
Dead Rising and Table Tennis es-
pecially beckoning me to purchase
Microsoft’s beast, but the price tag
has remained beyond my cash-
strapped reach. With Christmas
and my birthday around the corner,
Microsoft and Nintendo will need to
convince me to buy their console.
Or, would I hold out until next year
and hand over a chunk of my stu-
dent loan for Sony’s latest offering?
As each generation of consoles
are gradually ushered in, a number
of decisions have to be made. Which
has the best games? Best graphics?
Which justifies its price tag most
sufficiently? But whereas my previ-
ous console choices have often been
made largely on the basis of which
company offered my favourite ex-
clusive titles, this upcoming cycle
of consoles each offer a varied and
diverse package compared to their
competitors – something arguably
unseen in previous generations.
On one hand, Microsoft offers
high definition graphics, some
cracking original IP and a superbly
implemented online experience
thanks to the company’s expertise
in this area, all at a very reasonable
asking price. The PS3 claims to of-
fer all this and then some whilst
probably being capable of frying
you breakfast somewhere inside its
shiny plastic casing. But coming in
at £425 you might expect it to rear
the porky pigs too. On the freakish
third hand, Nintendo’s baby can-
not compete graphically. However
the Wii is a courageous attempt to
revolutionise the way we interact
with games using a motion sensi-
tive controller whist remaining af-
fordable at £179.
Pre-orders for the Nintendo Wii
began last month, but I was tenta-
tive when deciding to put my name
down for one. From videos and
other peoples’ impressions, I was
concerned the ‘Wiimote’ was inac-
curate, often shaking around er-
ratically. Videos of the next Zelda
incarnation showed Link’s archery
skills leaving a lot to be desired, as
he zipped in an instant from look-
ing at the sky to staring at his feet.
Was it the player’s fault or were the
shakes setting into the young lad’s
bones? As with all new technology,
caution is required and Nintendo
had to answer the question persist-
ently nagging me. Simply: does it
work?
As for the PS3, which is not arriv-
ing in Europe until March, I was ea-
ger to see how much of a leap Sony
had made from the PlayStation 2
and whether it could justify such a
hefty price tag.
F
our eager gamers arrived
outside the ‘Wii House’
bright and early on the
Monday morning. Situ-
ated on a quiet residential
street in Holborn, this was the last
place we expected such a massive
corporation to hold its latest money
making machine. The Wii House
contained five floors of a gamer’s
nirvana: spotlessly clean mini-
malist contemporary furnishings,
complimentary biscuits and drinks,
roughly ten to twenty Wiis and an
attractive PR lady to greet and tend
to our needs.
First off, we were taken to the
first floor lounge where I man-
aged to sneak in a few minutes on
WarioWare Smooth Moves. A four
player game of tennis on Wii Sports
was already prepared for us, but
whilst my other three companions
stretched and jogged on the spot,
I had instantly taken control of the
Wiimote and ‘nunchaku’ for two
brief mini games on WarioWare.
No sooner than I’d plucked a man’s
nose hair, I was thrust a different
remote ready for tennis.
Within the first game, I felt im-
mediately familiar with the remote.
The tennis game required only use
of the Wiimote. Strokes were exact-
ly as you imagine, with the console
recognising the difference between
backhands, lobs, dinks and passes.
It was my turn to serve. I flicked
the remote upwards, and then
struck the “ball” with an emphatic
overhead swing. Ace! Take that! No
sooner than I tossed up my next
serve, the ball was immediately
coming back across court. Damn.
My ego took a bashing as my sec-
ond serve was returned across
court with authority. As the games
progressed, my competitive nature
began to rear its ugly nature to the
displeasure of my right elbow. Even
a simple tennis game such as this
managed to flex my muscles us-
ing the Wiimote. Once the chalk
had settled thought, each of us was
sporting a beaming smile.
Ten-pin bowling was up next. The
graphics in both this and the tennis
were clean, colourful and certainly
functional. Whilst Wii Sports was
certainly not pushing the console’s
graphical prowess, it was immedi-
ately obvious that the console would
never ever be challenging the Xbox
360 and PS3 in a beauty contest.
